<h3>胡夫人橋記</h3>
<p>— 金鶴望</p>
<p>蓬闓之鎭。崑山之東。瓦浦之流。匯於吳淞。有篤行君子。胡君石予。挈其偕隠耦曰夫人曹氏。厲儉勤爲鄉人率。夫人不役一厮婢。而閫内事無不舉。年垂暮。猶服無完裳。食不兼饌。顧夫人雖纖嗇。忍絲耐粟。而意常懇懇。思有所惠利於民物。瓦浦支流。曰鶴頸灣者。位蓬　西北二里。其石梁毁於咸豐庚申之役。難平而支以木。木又朽且折。鄉之趁墟肩薪菜果榖者。必繞道行。如是者三十年。欲葺之。僉謂無財賄。夫人閔然思。引爲己任。工未克舉而殂。於是諸子相與啓笥檢遺金而泣。願建斯橋。以成母志。禀於石予。石予曰可。歲庚午之冬。霜降潦縮。乃屬都料飭材奠基。日會集衆工積三旬而橋成。弛弤拱帶。涵波束溜。礱斵堅完。砥如闍如。自津渡關鬲。兩村耆媪。臨河嗟詫。一霎棣通。徒旅遝至。相與頌夫人之遺愛。願鑱石誌永久。錫名曰胡夫人橋。示質也。石予曰。吾老友金君文長於金石。宜爲記。乃記之。凡役徒斤椎楗石灰漿之費。都若干金。具報於里長。茲不著。著夫人之高義。後來君子。其以時葺治。無替厥績。（却酬）</p>
<h3>三二八之龍墩山</h3>
<p>— 懷冰</p>
<p>吾人在未接近鄉村生活以前。初不知陰曆之「三二八」爲鄉鎭上含有重大意義之令節。各地均有香會演劇等舉。而尤以唯亭之龍墩山爲特具希有之盛况。山中某廟於二十八二十九兩日演戲。四圍百十里内各村塸僉赴會集。都十萬衆。艤舟千數百艘。河面爲蔽。其所以能臻如是之盛者。蓋村有俗例。凡新嫁娘。於茲新三二八。均須偕新郎歸寗。赴母家宴。以陪桌愈多爲愈有面子。同時新夫婦由親友輩伴乘快船。開赴龍墩山觀劇。若新禮中之度蜜月然　視爲緊要之禮節。以是龍山之集。有會必盛。不必羅致名戲班而號召。故鄉例復有「懊惱龍墩山」之諺。然雖口說懊惱。集會興致。初未少减。返棹過鎭市。爭先恐後。啣尾而進。延及二三小時。舟始過盡。亦足以槪其盛况矣。</p>
<h3>三游姑蘇記</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>余自寄跡滬上。已兩遊蘇州。辛未春暮。又偕愛國女生作三次之遊。春雨紛紛。於淋漓泥濘中。跋山涉水。殊饒佳趣。雖河山無恙。而人事不無變遷。撮而記之。以備異日之觀覽焉。</p>
<p>九畹　時留園方開蘭花會。三湘奇種。九畹異葩。芬芳來襲。如入善人之室。紅呼燕尾。白號魚魫。丹頴悅目。紫翹馨心。其秀質靈根。幽色古香。冠衆卉而掩羣芳。又豈只與秋菊爭秀。申椒並美而已哉。</p>
<p>三遊　此次爲余第三次遊蘇。愛國女學生適爲初中三。合予子鑫共成三七之數。分寓三新旅館之三房間。勾留三日。又當暮春三月。三三兩兩。携手遨遊於三吳勝地。或參三寳之佛。或登三清之殿。覘三元坊。瞰第三泉。觀秋香三笑之枕石。窺殉劍三千之劍池。登高矗雲漢之九層北寺塔。遙望太湖三萬六千頃之汪洋。眞有鵬飛九萬里之志矣。</p>
<p>二兪　太倉劍華。南社文壇巨子也。因與愚同名。遂成知交。現養疴家居。其子成輝。肄業蘇州美專。余特携鑫兒與之相見。面貌頗似兄弟。同行者咸笑目爲兩小兪劍華云。</p>
<p>一衙　參觀蘇州中學。設備精美辦理完善。人數衆多。共分五校。爲蘇省中學之冠。其生物標本中有胡蜂巢一。大如斗。色如檀。紋如潮。窺其中則千門萬戶排比齊整。胡蜂之大逾一寸。螫人可致死。據云。全數不下十數萬。可謂世上第一大蜂衙矣。</p>
<p>半紅　學生中有上半身御紅絨衫者。行市中。蘇人見者咸大愕怪、羣相指目。亦少見多怪之流也</p>

<h3>霍桑探案轉灣（二四）</h3>
<p>— 程小靑</p>
<p>（八）種瓜得瓜</p>
<p>這時候霍桑已付了我們三個小的飯賬。立起身來。穿上一件玄色薄呢的外上一拍。又凑着他的耳朶說道。「你再瞧瞧。那剛要走出玻璃門的男子。你可也認識麽。」邱奎仔細一瞧。陡的立起身來。他的嘴裏也不期然而然的發出一聲驚呼。我才覺得邱奎在那晚上祇見這惡少穿外衣的背形。莫怪他直到此刻。方才認識。當時霍桑又止住他道。「輕聲些。我勸你用嘴不如用手。並且須聽我的命令。自圖脫身。」霍桑的說話没完。邱奎早急急的追出門去。霍桑向我丢了一個眼色。整一整衣領。我們取了帽子。也向著那玻璃門口走去。霍桑故意走在前面。脚步又故意放緩。分明要攔阻我的樣子。我心中雖急得似火燒一般但也没法搶前。</p>
<p>一會兒。我們剛走出菜館的大門。耳朶中忽接受了一種清脆的摑掌聲音。我再忍耐不住。急急走下階石。回頭向東首裏一瞧。馬路上很靜。那少年正在人行道上。他的胸口却已被邱奎的强有力的左手一把抓住。邱奎的右手的巨靈之掌。正連續在那少年的左右的頰上用力批　。嘴裏又不住的駡着「騙子。騙子。」這時那同行的女子也嚇得靠住了牆壁。舉起玉手。掩往了眼睛。似要昏暈過去的樣子。　那邱奎把這惡少毆擊的地點。和餐館的階石約模距離三四家門面。我們在階前站立了一兩分鐘的光景。霍桑忽故意咳了一聲嗽。似乎發一個暗號給邱奎的樣子。邱奎却似没有聽得。仍手不停揮的那少年的頭部胸部亂擊。說也奇怪。這陰險的惡少。除了把兩隻手在空中亂舞亂動作一種無效力的抵抗以外。竟啞口無聲。我遠遠望去。他的臉上分别已在流血丶再進一步。也許要發生危險。這時候霍桑的第二次咳聲又發。那聲浪也增了高度。這暗號立即發生了效果。我見邱奎的左手一放石手的拳頭。又和那少年的胸口作了一次最後的接觸。這呌做車時傑的惡少立即仰面跌倒在地上。那邱奎也同時放開脚步。向東走去。</p>
<p>當我們緩緩的走近那毆擊的所在丶這車時傑因着一個穿短衣的過路人的扶掖。已從地上爬了起來　那時傑的紅腫的左頰上面。掛着兩條鮮紅的血線。吸呼咻咻見了也怪可憐。他似乎還要表示他的勇氣。作勢要追踪上去。其實這舉動無非要掩飾面子。實際上决不敢追。但那短衣的路人。却在竭力勸阻。</p>

<h3>到葉家花園</h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>可愛的陽春、已甦醒過來了、蒼蒼的天幕、含着多量的甜蜜而又賦媚的微笑對着世人、那汪尖的大海裏、也湧現着碧油油的纖波、這有如那美麗的緋色女神、特意地賜予正在靑春時期的少年少女們的盛滿了光明愉快之酒的神杯一樣地可愛、大地是那麽樣的柔美、而又那麽樣的給人恩寵喲、哦、這是怎樣值得慶幸與讚賞的時候喲、</p>
<p>我的朋友—黄和陳以及姊姊鶯、眼看着這惹人遐思的好時候、因不甘給她輕輕地在我們的眼底下淄過、所以才發起在星期日的下午、去作尋春之遊、地點是暫定爲滬西的葉家家園、自然這個消息對於一個這樣好遊的我是非常被歡迎的了、可是爲了我們想獲得大量的興緻起見、因此、就議决了着各人負責去找求同志、至少每人是要找到一個人、同時他們並規定了那天彙集的地點、是在最爲適中的姊姊的學校裏、</p>
<p>短短的三天、在平時是過得那麽的快而輕鬆、然而在這時—遊心如箭的這時、却只覺得是漫長漫長的、然而縱然是如此、但這個爲我們所切盼着的星期日、終究是到備了、</p>
<p>到姊姊的學校裏最早的、還是要算我、其次的是春弟和德弟、更其次的是黄和沈了、他們來的時候、都是實行着議决案的、至少是兩個人、祇有我是個例外、我只一個人、原因是我本想去找程一同去的、但又誰知她這天被她的姨媽接家去過節了、此外、我是再没有别的同志、因此我只好硬了頭皮一個人的來、預備好是要受罰的、但誰知他們會在這融融的空氣中、竟把這件事給忘壞了哩、這眞是我的大幸、至於伴侣找得最多的、那當然要推姊姊了、因爲她同房間的、王吕和唐、已都忻忻然地在等待着出發了、尤其發噱的、是要算唐、她本來是因爲生了一個牙　、臉上綳着紗布怕難看、所以不想回去、但過後她看見我們還未出發、就已那們樣的興高采烈、引得她有些忍耐不住、於是她就拚了牙痛、毅然决然地加入了我們的集團、我還記得黄曾這樣地激過她來、</p>
<p>—密絲唐、去、没有關係的、索興讓它受了風大大地盡量地痛一痛、把痛的根痛完了、將來是會永不再痛的了、這句雖說是有點詼諧、但却帶有「毒病還得毒藥醫」的意味的話、終於在我們間、被引起了一陣歡愉的笑聲、</p>
<p>我們出了姊姊的學校、總共有十一個人、都擠進了一輛上江灣去的公共汽車裏、這樣、那怕這輛車本來是很空的、這時也得要滿滿的了、更何况本來就不很空的哩、路是那們的不平、於是車也就似搖籃般的擺動了起來、這樣、我們這批無所顧忌的靑年們的噪聲、却幾乎把這輛車也都給脹破（、我清清楚楚地聽到坐在王和吕左近的一位老太太對着他的同伴說、「你看、這一批靑年的學生、是多麽的愉快、他們一上來、這車裏、就變得這樣的鬧、」呵、親愛的老太太啊、在你這麽一句話裏、你使我充分地知道了你埋藏在心的深處的意思了、這是多麽的在羨慕著我們、和哀悼着你老去了的靑春的、啊、我可愛的靑年同志們、你們快快地來享受你們靑春的樂趣吧、切莫把她辜負了、待到將來徒自的悲哀啊、</p>
<p>汽車、只能乘到跑馬廳、從跑馬廳到葉園一段路、我們一致通過利用自己的兩條腿、我和元因爲在車站買了些吃的東西、所以就落在他們大隊人馬很遠很遠的後面、但我和元不願自甘落後、因此就發奮直追、實行百米賽跑、結果、我是得了勝利、但我在黄對春弟講的「好了、我買得了香檳」的一句話中、我知道我吃了虧了、我和元都被他們當作了馬、</p>
<p>在進葉園門的時分、我們糊裏糊塗地拿出了一張參觀證給守衛的人、他自然是不允許我們進去的、但我們人多、一湧早就混進了頭門、他也没了辦法、只得隨着我們呌「馬馬虎虎」了、</p>
<p>我們正要登峯造極的時分、姊姊又遇見了蜜司陳和她的朋友、王和吕乘着這個大家停止工作的時候、走向了一個潭畔、指着一隻很大的石蟹、嘴裏是喊着石龜、不久姊姊、和蜜絲沈又遇見了她們的熟人、是兩位很肥胖的馬丹姆、元見了、忙忙地拉着我、呌我看她們短而粗的小腿、起初我是不懂他呌我看的意思、過後、他說了「她們倆都是吃了肥田粉的啊、」我才恍然大悟、同時我却責怪着元、說他說話未免太刻薄了些、</p>
<p>過後、不知怎的、黄竟丢下了我們大隊、獨自地走到别處去了、我們大家以爲他是失踪了、我們不得不去尋他、可是花園是那麽的大、游人是那麽的多、我們怎能尋得到他呢、於是我們就不得不很無聊地坐在一池春水邊的草地上等他、在這個無聊的期待的時期中、我用着她巧妙的手術、把一枝柳條夾着許多種的花朶、編成了一個花圈、拿來套在今天特别高興的姊姊的頭上、呌她跳舞、於是、「…這是我的家…」的歌聲、和懽愉的舞姿、才又把我們這突變窒息下來的空氣打破、重復又到了我們初來時的高興的境地裏、這時路旁駐足而觀的其他的游人、莫不拿着一個含着微妙的笑容的臉子迎着我們、我猜想他們的心理、大槪也是在忻羨我們吧、</p>
<p>失踪了的黄、在這時也笑迷迷地回來了、於是又復開始我們巡園的工作、</p>
<p>我記得最末了我們是到了一塊很廣大的草塲上、這時塲上適巧正有着幾位廣東人在玩小皮球、也許是人多爲王的意識在支配着爲我們吧、我們也不去打個招呼、就不管三七二十一的搶着球就踢、踢球、我們雖然大家都不見得高明、但因爲太高興了、所以也顧不得了出醜、其中最引人發笑的、當然還是要推矮小的唐、她人是那麽樣的矮小、可是球又這樣的歡喜搶來踢、而踢出去的球、又是如此之遠—僅高過她本人一倍啊、這個、實在是不得不要被我們認做一個笑柄的所在了、後來在我們的球興、差不多都有些疲倦的時候、我才發覺在這個塲上、已被我們弄成了一個喧賓奪主的情狀了、因爲原來的這幾位主人、這時都已退出了、球塲之外、儘作壁上觀、哦、這是多麽的使我們感覺到難乎爲情啊、</p>
<p>在暮色蒼蒼之中、我們踏着綠茵如錦的歸程、各自抱着一個滿含着歡愉之意的心兒、回到了自己的學校裏、</p>

<h3>睡魔和先生</h3>
<p>— 征鴻</p>
<p>「噹……」一陣散漫却帶着威脅　上課鐘聲、驅我們進了敎室、這是午後第一課、而且又是不很有趣味的英文、所以誰也覺得懶懶的、有些不高興、</p>
<p>先生進來了、他劃好點名簿後、就翻開讀本、頭頸一伸、胸微微一挺、顯然的、他是在勉力振作起來、開始講　他自己也不很喜歡的功課、</p>
<p>起初　先生的聲音是很清　的、後來聽去愈弄愈低、變成　續的懶懶的催眠的調子、不知還是我們自己的耳朶在作怪、成是他的聲音眞的變了、一陣暖風、一酥酥一地從窗外吹來、也帶着睡意、於是我們面前書上的字、漸漸浮動起來、而先生的聲音竟至模糊了、睡魔從四面逼來、克服了這敎室、有幾個同學、不知不覺眼皮漸漸合上、用手支撑着頭、有的巳支持不住、伏在書桌上了、</p>
<p>在這種夢的狀態之下、我們忘了在什麽地方、先生責備也好、良心自責也好、一切都顧不得了、實在的、在這時、根本没有思想的餘暇、並不知自己是在睡着了、而且、飯後這一時、本不宜於讀書而宜於小睡的、所以就自然而然的睡着了、這情形恰和夜裏睡時相反、夜裏往往我們絲毫不覺得倦時、討厭的睡鐘、就硬催我們去睡、睡在牀上、儘管念着睡呵睡呵、却總是睡不着、</p>
<p>在睡魔支配配中、忽然似乎聽見一聲咳嗽、後來又是一個很響的聲音、把我們不穏定的夢驚碎了、這聲音是說、「我來問你們、」接着「李珍、你把這一句分析出來、」我們不由的微張被驚擾而含怨的眼睛、茫茫然抬起頭來、以爲總要與先生嚴厲的目光遇着了、然而不然、他的目光滿含着憐憫與妬羨、似乎在說、「你們倒寫意、」</p>
<p>這時、李珍已慢慢地站起來、遲疑了一會、喉中「唔」的一聲、坐在旁邊的一位同學、立刻知道了她的困難是在不知問的是那一句、便用簡接的方法問道、「先生、這句請再講一遍、意思不大明白、」這樣、先生一講、李珍就立刻迅速的分析出來了、</p>
<p>又講了一段後、先生以和婉的聲音、說、「今天少上些罷、天氣使你們這樣没有精神、但請你們在課後去看、……」分明的、這是他對於方才的驚擾、表示道歉的意思、</p>
<p>下課鐘一響、先生便很快的走出敎室、好像久困重圍、才得脫身一樣、</p>

<h3>愛姆登艦最光榮的一頁</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>新近來滬的德國愛姆登軍艦、他的船首龍骨上有一個鐵十字章浮彫、這就是紀念老愛姆、　登功績的標識、也就是愛姆登軍艦在大戰史中最光榮的一頁、愛姆登巡洋艦一共有三艘、現在所說的是名垂不朽的第二艘、大戰開始的幾個月中、他在印度洋中　巡弋、屢建奇功、後來在科科司島被澳洲巡洋艦雪尼　號肇沉、德皇威廉第二爲紀念她的功</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>績起見、特准内閣特别動議、將艦名「愛姆登」賜予生還的一百五十名船員。做他們的姓氏、德國現内閣重新　將這個法令通過、使愛姆登的名留傳百世、本文原著者漢司海士</p>
<p>哈姆史愛姆登氏、爲老　愛姆登生還船員之一、所述爲愛姆登沉復前後一段驚心怵目的故事、譯之如後、</p>
<p>在本文開始的時候、我要向現來上海訪問的新愛姆登艦司令致敬、艦長魏德福原是老愛姆登的大副、在我所曉得的官長中、要算他最卓越了、他是一個幹練聰明的領袖、謙和仁愛、後有長官傲慢的習氣、因之大小船員、後有不愛戴他的、我胆敢說、凡是舊日和他認識的、聽見他現在指揮新愛姆登、一定非常欣慰、</p>
<p>老愛姆登艦上所備的船員、都是德國揀撰出來的人、須要體格健全、身家清白、辦事幹練的、始能入選、海軍入伍有四年的期限、平時給養又極菲薄、陸軍服役不過兩年、可是志願入海軍的常常超過下額、</p>
<p>我在十八歲的時候、家長决計送我到工業大學裏學習四時、在離家之前、他允許我往北海旅行一次、當我達到威廉港的時候、我看見他（指愛姆登）威武耀揚使我十分欽仰、於是我情願加入海軍、從此我便不願忘返去、而不久之後、家長也就允許我投身海軍、起初他一定要我到大學裏去念書、後來纔變更宗旨、這大槪我進大學要付兩倍費用的緣故罷、我産生於得港、他們常當我爲英國人、就是後來做了俘虜、摩爾太英軍當局曾費了兩天工夫、考查我究經是德人還是英人</p>
<p>我的願意投身海軍、也是出於天性、我的父親和祖父都是海員、我的哥哥早已加入海軍、他在福克蘭島一役、與「紐勃」艦同時沉没於海、</p>
<p>與雪尼號相遇</p>
<p>大戰爆發的當兒、愛姆登駐在印度洋站、爲了幸運和艦長馮穆拉的才具、我們服務的成績非常優異、有許多船隻被我們獲到、還有許多沉後在我們的手中、而我們祇受着微細的損失、幸運地逃過困難、</p>
<p>我們的活動終於一九一四年十一月、在科科司　停止、那時候因爲我們的地位非常不幸、　方的指揮運用了他精密的軍略、較長的彈距、和增快的速率、那澳洲巡洋艦雪尼號、便將吾船擊沉、除了四十九人之外、不是殺死便被生擒、</p>
<p>愛姆登臨終兩天的恐懼、我永遠不能忘懐、那時我們停留在島旁的珊瑚環海港裏、在十一月九日的清晨、茂開上校率領了四十九人登岸、將敵人目標的電報站拆毁、這是輕易的事、我紀得和别幾個船員立在甲板上、親眼看見電報站的桅桿倒在地上、</p>
<p>太陽上昇的時候、一小羣的人在甲板上歡笑談話、每件東西看上去都是安靜和平的　大家都很快活、這故事好像老嫗所說的、迷信而不足爲信、一個不幸的預兆使我在同伴之中、顯出憂鬱悲觀的樣子、有幾個人批我不高興的樣子、我就回答說、上一夜我做個惡夢、愛姆登甲板都被赤血濱透、我所熟議的許多面　、現在正笑着的、在夢裏却是慘　可怕、好像被吾們擊沉的船隻上的船員一般、我又對我的同伴說、我覺着這是我們最後一次看見日出了、在後有遇到「雪尼」之前、我把此事記入日記之中、在會戰之後、很可證明我的直覺並不是一種幻象、後來我又曉得同伴中有兩人、得着同樣的夢、（待續）</p>

From November of last year to May of this year, excluding all other supplies, the total cost of grain and forage purchases alone has reached over six million, which is not something that the dozens of counties in southern Shanxi can afford to repay on their own. Therefore, grain and forage loans have been organized, with the burden shared among all counties in the province. The million borrowed from Tianjin and Beiping is not enough to clear the back pay owed to Jin-Sui troops before February. Even if the Central Government starts issuing pay from May, the pay for March and April is still not secured. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping A certain important figure in Beiping has just received a telegram from Shang Zhen, stating that he (Shang) is currently distributing pay to the various armies and planning measures to rectify finances and provide relief to the counties in southern Shanxi that are supplying food to the stationed troops.

<h3>There is a Trend for the World Silver Price Conference to be Convened by China</h3>
<p>Nanjing Financial circles have heard that a World Silver Price Conference is inevitable. However, the United States, Britain, and Japan have all declined the responsibility of convening it. Other countries are also unwilling to take the position of initiator. Due to its important economic relationship, China may be the country to convene the conference. The venue would be located in China, without China taking the official position of convener. This should be carefully considered. US President Hoover, Deputy Secretary of State Ke Malei'er, and Minister Wu Chaoshu had a meeting in which they expressed support. Wu has telegraphed back, reporting everything. The Chinese representatives to the International Chamber of Commerce, Bei Songsun and Lin Kanghou, believe that the main point of the matter is that countries must be able to determine the status and value of silver. Furthermore, silver-producing countries should be able to abide by and support the resolutions of the conference, breaking the policies of dumping and overproduction. These representatives have expressed their views in London and other places and are currently holding further consultations with British and American authorities. The production of silver by Britain (India) and the United States (Mexico) can actually influence world silver prices. If Britain and the United States can understand immediately, then the outcome will be satisfactory if the conference is convened by China. The government plans to convene experts for close consultations as soon as Bei Songsun and others return home. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Issue of Limiting Air Forces</h3>
<p>According to a New York dispatch today concerning the exercises of the American air force, the various combat scenarios described indicate exceptional diligence in their daily equipment and training. Furthermore, a World News Agency report states that Britain is preparing a large-scale construction project in Gibraltar, a strategic point in the Mediterranean, to build a large aircraft hangar capable of accommodating 290 heavy and light bombers, as well as fighter and reconnaissance planes, demonstrating their urgency in expanding their air force. France's aviation budget for this year has also increased to 2.3 billion francs. Although Aviation Minister Painlevé has stated that the purpose of France's aviation program is solely for self-defense, their efforts at advancement are progressing rapidly day by day. The Japanese military authorities' proposed air force preparation plan includes establishing 23 new aircraft squadrons, constructing three times the number of aircraft carrier-based planes, and establishing an aircraft design and production experimental institute at the Yokosuka naval port, with a total expenditure reaching a staggering 200 million yuan. It is evident that today, no major power is neglecting the vigorous expansion of its air force. This type of extremely expensive and advanced emerging military force will gradually surpass the army and navy in its strategic importance in warfare. Now that the army and navy have repeatedly held meetings to devise methods for limiting them, the limitation of air forces will inevitably become a problem. According to a recent Geneva dispatch, the main issue on the agenda for next year's disarmament conference will be the limitation of air forces, adding another major point of contention to international conferences. It is safe to say that with countries vigorously developing their air forces, vying with each other and not giving themselves even a day's break, will the notion of limitation be even more difficult to achieve than the success of the London Treaty?</p>

<p>London report: Britain is utilizing the mountainside of Gibraltar, a strategic point in the Mediterranean, to undertake a large-scale project, constructing a large aircraft hangar capable of accommodating 290 heavy and light bombers, as well as fighter and reconnaissance aircraft.

<h3>He Yingqin Returns to Jiangxi from Nanjing</h3>
<p>He says the Guangdong Incident Can Hopefully be Resolved Peacefully</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Nanchang Headquarters, went to Nanjing on the 4th of this month to attend the National Assembly. Now that He is in charge of anti-banditry in five provinces, which is extremely important, he specially returned to Jiangxi from Nanjing on the 21st aboard the Yuzhang warship. The scheduled journey was to arrive in Xun that evening, but because the warship ran aground near Xiaogushan in Madang, it was stranded. It was not until noon on the 22nd that it arrived in Jiujiang. At 1 p.m., he took a special train on the Nanchang-Xunpu Railway to the province. At 4:30 p.m., the train arrived at Niuhang Station. Welcoming him were Chief of Staff He of the headquarters, personnel from the eight departments, Governor Wang of the Civil Affairs Department, Director Gong of the Construction Department, Acting Garrison Commander Tu, Mayor Gong, and others. After He got off the train and exchanged greetings with representatives from all sectors, he took a small ferry across the river and returned to the headquarters residence. Along the way, the National Government's Guard Division, the 52nd Division's Special Service Company, and river and land police were on guard, with very strict security. Accompanying He were his wife, Wang Wenxiang, Chief of the Adjutant's Office, Wang Wenyan, Chief of Staff, Sun Muja, Secretary Lin Qizhi, and dozens of Qu soldiers. That evening, Sun Xiweng, representative of Chen Mingshu, went to the headquarters to meet with He. The other senior officials and generals also went to the headquarters to report on political and military affairs. According to He's remarks, the results of the National Assembly were excellent, and the central government should strive to implement the resolutions. The Guangdong incident is now being mediated by comrades such as Sun Ke, Zhang Ji, and Wu Tiecheng, and a peaceful resolution is hoped for. Anti-banditry in Jiangxi should continue to be actively pursued, unaffected by the current situation. (May 22nd)</p>
<h3>Kong Bandits in Fengxin, Jiangxi, Have Been Repelled</h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army Specializes in Anti-Banditry</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Kong Hechong bandit gang in northwestern Jiangxi, previously led by Tong Wan and posing as the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd Divisions, sneaked into Fengxin and Gao'an via Yifeng. When a small portion of the gang probed Gao'an, merchants and residents in the county town were extremely panicked. Fortunately, County Magistrate Che Fu maintained calm, on one hand firmly defending the city walls, and on the other hand sending a police team to the Xu Defense area, forming a coordinated defensive position with Deputy Regimental Commander Zhang Shi of the local garrison. Later, the 32nd Independent Brigade also sent a regiment of reinforcements, which slightly reassured the residents. Those who sneaked into Fengxin were the main force of the Kong bandits, personally led by Kong Hechong, with more than 3,000 troops and over 1,000 guns. On the 14th, they captured Luofang, and on the 17th, they attacked the county town, confronting the local garrison. An'yi was only dozens of miles away from Fengxin, and the situation was also very critical. The fellow villagers in the province from the county telegraphed Director He to report, and pleaded for troops to be sent to intercept them quickly. The telegram read: "According to a report from fellow villagers in the province, Kong Hechong's bandits, about 3,000 strong, with about 1,000 guns, captured Luofang on a cold day. On the 9th, Fengxin and Gao'an were said to have been occupied. Our county is close to Fengxin, only forty miles away. It is also heard that the Kong bandits intend to probe Nanchang along the Nanchang-Xunpu Railway from An'yi. Our county's defense force is weak, and the people are in a state of panic. We earnestly request that you quickly send a large army from Yongsui Nipu and other areas to attack head-on, so that the bandits have nowhere to escape." However, the headquarters received an air force report yesterday stating that the bandits had already retreated and were planning to return to Tong Wan's old nest. The headquarters also sent troops to join forces with Liu's brigade in Yifeng and a portion of Tan's division to encircle and suppress the bandits. The 19th Route Army's Jiang Guangnai's Dai and Cai divisions are now in southern Jiangxi, specializing in anti-banditry, and are diligently carrying out the anti-banditry plan originally set by Director He. Cai's division has been advancing step by step from Chongxianwei and Chenggangwei in Xingguo towards Donggu. Dai's division is advancing from Jiangbeidong towards Ningdu, never stopping. Jiang Guangnai reports to Director He on the anti-banditry situation daily. As for Huang's brigade and Tan's regiment of the 8th Route Army in Xinfeng, they are still searching and suppressing the local bandits within the county. According to a report by Regiment Commander Tan Langxing, on the 8th, the bandit leaders Zeng Renchao, Huang Weihan, and others in the Changan坑 area of Xinfeng were defeated, and many bandits were killed. The bandit forces were unable to withstand the pressure and fled to Niugang and other places. They are currently being pursued. Sun Xiweng came to Jiangxi under orders, accompanied by Tang Deyu, chief of the general affairs section of the 60th Division's supply department, and others. They arrived in the province from Nanjing on the 20th and have already telegraphed General Commander Jiang and Division Commander Cai, reporting that they plan to transfer to Xingguo via Ji'an and Ganzhou to discuss important matters. It is said that Sun will set off after receiving a reply. (May 22nd)</p>

<h3>International Women and Children Investigation Team Visits Shenyang</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The International League of Nations Eastern Women and Children Investigation Team, having completed its investigation in Tianjin and other places, arrived in Shenyang by Beining train on the night of the 14th. Military and political leaders sent representatives to the station to welcome them. After the team got off the train, they interacted with the welcomers one by one and then stayed at the Kaining Hotel on Sanjing Road in the commercial port. They have been busy for days, visiting the provincial government chairman, the foreign affairs special envoy, and key personnel from the public security bureau, as well as touring famous historical sites in the Northeast, such as the Imperial Palace. The foreign affairs special envoy, Wang Jinghuan, and the provincial government chairman, Zang Shiyi, both hosted banquets on specific dates. Yesterday afternoon, they visited the local court and the provincial relief center. In the evening, accompanied by the superintendent of the public security bureau, they visited various brothels in the city. Today, they visited schools for poor children, etc. They are scheduled to leave Shenyang tomorrow. According to the main members of the team, the points of attention for this investigation in the Northeast are: (1) Whether White Russians have set up agencies in the Northeast to traffic women and children, and the operation of brothels. (2) Whether there are trafficked women and children in the Northeast being sold abroad. (3) A considerable number of disaster victims have come to the Northeast to reclaim wasteland. Whether there are any cases of trafficking among them. After days of detailed investigation, it was learned that there were no facts corresponding to the above three items, so they were very satisfied. They have already obtained a lot of materials from the current investigation, but they have not yet been fully organized, so a specific judgment cannot be made. After returning to Geneva, they will create an investigation report and report it to the international conference. Whether this trip will return to Shenyang to investigate the situation within the Japanese leased territories is currently not determined. (May 19th)</p>
<h3>The Reason for the Closure of the Hunan Anti-Opium Society</h3>
<p>In the Name of Anti-Opium, Actually Spreading Opium</p>
<p>Bandits Mixed In, Public Opinion Boiled Over</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Previously, Xiao Jiyu and others here initiated the Hunan Anti-Opium Society. At that time, they printed declarations and posted slogans, and people in society expressed considerable sympathy. However, since the establishment of the society, it has been spreading opium in the name of anti-opium. According to investigations, the branches of the society established in various counties all adopted a contract system for those acting as directors or presidents. They had to pay a certain amount of joining fees first. If one person was not enough, they would pool together, just like the "Qianzi Tuan" (brokerage group) of the former Likin Bureau. After the director or president arrived in the county, they would subcontract according to the township, issuing licenses to opium smokers. Therefore, by contracting a county, the director or president could earn thousands or hundreds of yuan per month. It is said that Peng contracted Changde for 2,100 yuan, Baoqing for 1,500 yuan, and Lizhou for 1,800 yuan. The other counties were either several thousand yuan or several hundred yuan, depending on the number of opium smokers and the tax rate, just like the former Prohibition Bureau. Moreover, the Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau previously captured the Red bandit ringleader Fan Shaoying and others, who confessed that they had brought money to the province to contract the affairs of the Anti-Opium Society in order to secretly plot activities. Such fraudulent fundraising not only damages the national image but also weakens the race. Furthermore, bandits hoped to mix in among them. Therefore, public opinion was in an uproar. When He Jian heard about the matter, he immediately dispatched Wen Qiyuan, a member of the Military Law Department of the headquarters, to investigate. After receiving a report confirming that the allegations were true, He immediately ordered the Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau to close the society to prevent future troubles. The text of the order is recorded as follows: "Previously, the Director of the Bureau presented the captured Red Party ringleader Fan Shaoying to the Department. According to the confession of the bandit, this time he brought money to the province to contract the affairs of the Anti-Opium Society in order to secretly plot activities, and entrusted Ou Futang to introduce him. Subsequently, this Department summoned Ou Futang for interrogation. According to his confession, the Fan bandit did have this idea, but it had not yet been carried out. I have now contracted the Xiangtan branch of the Anti-Opium Society, and have paid a deposit of 200 yuan. The charter stipulates that after the establishment of the branch, a registration fee of several yuan or dozens of yuan may be collected monthly from the opium smokers and earthen houses, etc. After ordering Wen Qiyuan, a lieutenant officer of this Department, to go for inspection and report, he replied, presenting the matter of the reply. Upon receiving your order, I ordered Wen Qiyuan of this Department to take soldiers to Shuiyuelin in this city to investigate whether the Hunan Anti-Opium Society is a formal organization, and whether it has been reported to the government for record, and to jointly check the incoming and outgoing documents with the party and local police for suspicion of colluding with bandits. If criminal evidence is found, immediately bring the case for investigation. This order, etc. Upon receiving this, I obeyed the order and led four soldiers, disguised without any connection to the soldiers, to the reception desk of the society, falsely claiming to be looking for Secretary-General Yi to buy a job, and inquired about the person in charge of the society, who said that there were seven committee members."</p>
<p>"Zhou Xiwu is the chief, but all are currently not at the society," etc. Subsequently, I, together with police officer Zhang Zheqing, implemented the inspection. However, I saw more than a dozen young men in Western suits, but no committee members. The incoming and outgoing documents, various public and private letters, were all missing. There were only two resolutions unrelated to the main purpose, one propaganda slogan, one opium tax table, and one copy each of the society's organizational outline and charter. Moreover, it was found that the resolutions were from the fourth and sixth periods. The first, second, third, and fifth periods were never seen. It is suspected that the society, because the newspapers recently revealed its inside story, and this Department has taken the contractor Ou Futang into custody (it is said that Ou contracted Xiangtan, that is, introduced the already executed Red bandit Fan Shaoying, Zhang Jiexun, etc., as contractors for the anti-opium society in the Huarong area), has hidden various important documents in advance, so I could not find out. I had no choice but to return to the Department with the aforementioned documents and the written guarantee from the duty officer Huang Shude that there were no omissions and no illegal activities. I humbly request your review and instruction on how to handle the matter, etc. Whether the Anti-Opium Society has been approved by the official authorities for establishment, this Department has no record of it. However, the various sections of Ou Futang's confession and Lieutenant Wen's reply are indeed false fundraising and violate the law and discipline. If strict measures are not taken to suppress it, I am afraid that bandits will mix in among them, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, this order instructs the Bureau to immediately follow the order and immediately dispatch police officers to seal up the Anti-Opium Society. If any other illegal activities are found, the organizers should be arrested and investigated separately, without any favoritism. The situation of compliance should still be reported for information." (May 19)</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Hunan Province's Automobile Road Project</h3>
<p>1,590 Li Have Been Opened to Traffic</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The construction of automobile roads in Hunan Province began in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. At that time, the entire province was divided into three counties: Central Hunan, Western Hunan, and Southern Hunan. Representatives were gathered by the people of each road to discuss and determine the route. The funds were added to the land tax, Likin, and salt tax of each county. Each elected a general manager and submitted it to the provincial government for appointment. It was entirely a government-supervised, privately-run operation. However, privately-run operations not only had their own policies, making it impossible to connect the routes, but also progressed too slowly, and many failed to complete on schedule. It was not until September of the eighteenth year that the provincial government established the Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau, appointing Liu Yuehou as the director, abolishing the three roads in Central, Southwest, and unifying them. The entire province was divided into seven major trunk lines and several branch lines, to be completed over the years. It is estimated that all highways will be completed in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China. The general situation of the progress of all road projects was reported to the National Government Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications for review. A brief description is given below to show the situation of Hunan Province's highways.</p>
<p>The seven major trunk lines of Hunan Province are: (1) The Xiang-Guangdong Line: Starting from Changsha, passing through Xiangtan, Hengyang, Leiyang, Chen County, and Yizhang, to connect with the provincial road of Lechang in Guangdong, totaling 845 li. The 725 li from Changsha to Chen County has now been completed and opened to traffic. The approximately 120 li from Chen County to the Guangdong border is under construction and is expected to be open to traffic by the end of June of this year. (2) The Xiang-Guangxi Line: Starting from Hengyang, passing through Qiyang and Lingling to connect with the provincial road of Quan County in Guangxi, totaling 390 li. The 60 li from Hengyang to Quanhua has been opened to traffic. The 60 li from Quanhua to Hongqiao is under construction. (3) The Xiang-Guizhou Line: Starting from Xiangtan, passing through Xiangxiang, Shaoyang, Hongjiang, Qianyang, Zhijiang, and Huang County, to connect with the provincial road of Zhenyuan in Guizhou, totaling 1,160 li. The 450 li from Xiangtan to Taohuaping has long been completed and opened to traffic. The 120 li from Taohuaping to Gaosha City is under construction. (4) The Xiang-Sichuan Line: Starting from Xiangxiang, passing through Xinhua, Xupu, Yuanling, Chenxi, Guzhang, and Baojing, to connect with the provincial road of Youyang in Sichuan, totaling 1,110 li. The 90 li from Xiangxiang to Loudi is under survey and construction. (5) The Xiang-Jiangxi Line: Starting from Changsha, passing through Liuyang to connect with the provincial road of Jiangxi, which is selected to pass through Wanzai, totaling 300 li. The 60 li from Changsha to Yongan City has now been opened to traffic. (6) The Xiang-Hubei East Line: Starting from Huanghua City on the Xiang-Jiangxi Line, passing through Pingjiang to reach Tongcheng in Hubei, totaling 120 li. The 70 li from Huanghua City to Gaoqiao is under construction. (7) The Xiang-Hubei West Line: Starting from Changsha, passing through Ningxiang, Yiyang, Changde, Jin County, and Jin City, to reach Gong'an and Shashi in Hubei, totaling 695 li. The 350 li from Changsha to Changde has been opened to traffic. In addition to the trunk lines, there are branch lines: (1) The Changde-Hongjiang Branch Line: From Changde via Taoyuan and Yuanling to Hongjiang, totaling 800 li. The 70 li from Changde to Taoyuan has been opened to traffic. The 120 li from Taoyuan to Xintianyi is under construction. (2) The Liuyang-Rucheng Branch Line: From Liuyang via Liling, You County, Chaling, Ling County, Guidong to Rucheng, totaling 870 li. The 180 li from Liling to You County has been opened to traffic. The 90 li from You County to Chaling is under construction. The total length of the roads that have been opened to traffic on the above trunk and branch lines is actually 1,590 li. The estimated cost of surveying, land acquisition, roadbeds, bridges, sand paving, houses, telephones, etc., is 3,600 yuan per li, totaling more than 5 million yuan. (May 21)</p>
<h3>After the Coal Merchants Along the Jiaozhou Railway Went on Strike</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau Telegraphed the Ministry for Instructions on the Suspension of Operations</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Zibo Zhangwei Mining and Coal Industry Joint Association, due to the request that the Jiaozhou Railway Bureau cancel the increased freight charges, implemented a strike on the 21st. When the Jiaozhou Railway Bureau received the news that the coal industry had decided to suspend operations entirely, it immediately telegraphed Nanjing to Chairman Ge, requesting instructions from the Ministry. At the same time, it telegraphed to invite representatives of the coal merchants to Qingdao to discuss solutions. During the meeting, all members of the Jiaozhou Railway attended. The Bureau explained that the price increase for freight was handled according to the resolution of the State Council of the Executive Yuan submitted by the Ministry of Railways, and was not an automatic proposal by the Railway Bureau. Whether it could be cancelled should be telegraphed to the Ministry for verification and then determined. However, the mining side consistently insisted on suspending operations. After both parties negotiated, it was agreed that if the cancellation was required, it would still have to be submitted to the State Council, and the procedures were complicated and could not be resolved in a short period of time. As a result, the Railway Bureau proposed a special price reduction of 20% for both exports and domestic sales from June 1 to the end of September of this year. During this period, the mining side could request the Ministry of Railways. The mining side was also satisfied with this. It then telegraphed the Boshan coal merchants for their opinions. By the time the Boshan reply was received, they insisted that if the cancellation was not achieved, they would proceed with the suspension of operations. Therefore, the suspension of operations still occurred on the 21st. The mining side also telegraphed to the central government and the Ministry of Railways, requesting the cancellation of the increased freight charges. At the same time, it issued a declaration, stating the situation of the implementation of the suspension of operations and requesting assistance from all sectors. As for the Railway Bureau, because the suspension of operations by the coal merchants was of great importance to the railway, it specifically telegraphed the meeting situation between the two parties and the process of the coal merchants' suspension of operations to Chairman Ge in Beijing and the Ministry of Railways, requesting instructions on how to handle it.

<h3>The Severity of the Disaster in Ningxia</h3>
<p>Garrison Forcibly Levies Opium Tax</p>
<p>Following the Drought, There Was Also a Wind Disaster</p>
<p>Ningxia Correspondence: Since the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, large armies have gathered in Ningxia, requiring huge expenses. The Ningxia region is very small and has little income. With a small amount of grain and funds, the demand is unlimited, and the numbers are bound to be inconsistent. As a result, excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies have emerged one after another, especially the opium tax, which has been increased repeatedly and is still not satisfied. Later, the garrison strictly ordered that all people's land, regardless of whether it was planted with opium or not, should be subject to the opium tax. By the nineteenth year, the tax was levied at two to three yuan per mu. All other miscellaneous levies were borne by the land. As of now, people have been unable to obtain food due to the heavy burden, and the number of those who have fled is increasing day by day. Those who have not fled have gathered to petition the local government to exempt them from taxes and levies, and to release emergency relief for assistance. It is heard that the central government has allocated 200,000 yuan for relief to the three provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, but it is unknown when the funds will be allocated.</p>
<p>In recent years, Ningxia has been plagued by famine and drought, which has become widespread. People's livelihoods have reached the point of bankruptcy. They are hoping that the government will provide relief as soon as possible to prolong their lives and wait for the autumn harvest. Among them, more than half of the people in more than fifty villages, such as Hongguang and Chongkou in Pingluo County, have already fled. Unexpectedly, they have recently suffered from a hurricane. The fertile land in that area has been completely buried by coarse sand, and countless houses have collapsed. According to recent investigations, at least more than 100,000 mu of land has been buried. Currently, the refugees in that area have no intention of returning, and those who have not fled have no way to make a living in the future. Therefore, they hope that the government will provide relief even more urgently. (May 9)</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association Urges the Issuance of Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Soup Kitchens and Shelters to Close at the End of May</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Water Conservancy Association Focuses on Work Relief</p>
<p>Investigation of the Tragic Situation After the Disaster in Zhenping County</p>
<p>Xi'an Correspondence: The Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association held its 26th committee meeting on the 15th. Kang Jiyao, Lu Hewen, Wang Yishan, Wang Yinzhi, Nan Hanchen, and Gao Jieren attended. After the meeting was opened as scheduled, Lu Hewen first reported on the incoming and outgoing documents. Then, Chairman Kang reported on the disaster relief efforts in Beijing and Shanghai, and the transfer of relief flour through the 17th Route Beijing Office. He also publicized the disaster situation and finally raised the issue of rural relief after the disaster, proposing that special attention be paid, or suggesting that the provincial government ask the Political Affairs Committee to discuss solutions. The following motions were then discussed: (1) The motion to expedite the issuance of relief funds was resolved to telegraph the National Assembly and President Yu, requesting the central government to expedite the issuance. (2) The motion to distribute mung bean seeds was resolved to distribute 90 packages each to Liquan, Qian County, Fufeng, and Xinglin Town, and 105 packages to Wugong. (3) The motion to subsidize the food for the soup kitchens of the Hui Disaster Relief Association was resolved to subsidize 40 bags of millet. (4) Temporary motion: The resolution to close all soup kitchens and shelters at the end of May was passed.</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Disaster Relief Water Conservancy Association sent a telegram yesterday to the Nanjing Construction Committee, the Huai River Management Committee, the Tianjin North China Water Conservancy Association, the Beiping North China Relief General Association, the Construction Departments of various provinces, and the Water Conservancy Bureaus of various provinces, stating, "Shaanxi is unfortunately suffering from a severe famine, which has lasted for four years. Nearly half of the population has died. Fortunately, with the joint rescue efforts of the government and charitable organizations at home and abroad, the majority of the population has been able to survive. However, natural disasters are prevalent and occur every few years. If we want to seek fundamental relief, there is no better solution than to use work relief to carry out water conservancy projects. With this in mind, we have organized the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Water Conservancy Promotion Association and publicly elected Wang Yiting, Jiao Yitang, Wang Boming, Li Yizhi, Ma Qingwan, Han Weixi, Duan Zhongtao, Lü Yizhai, and Kang Jiyao as executive committee members. However, the matter is of great importance and prone to failure. We have always admired your outstanding achievements and extensive experience. We earnestly request your timely advice to correct our shortcomings and to send us books, plans, and publications related to water conservancy for reference and learning. We earnestly pray for your kind attention. The Shaanxi Disaster Relief Water Conservancy Promotion Association bows."</p>
<p>Zhenping County in Shaanxi Province is located in the high mountains and has always been known for its extreme poverty. The soil is thin, the population is sparse, and harvests are rare. In recent years, disasters such as soldiers, bandits, insects, epidemics, floods, fires, droughts, and hailstorms have occurred frequently. For example, in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Sichuan bandit Yan Su occupied the town, and the rebel Shen Yuncheng helped him to do evil, raping, looting, burning, and killing to the extreme of cruelty. From March 28 of the eighteenth year until February of the following year, they occupied the area for a year. In addition to the destruction of civilian houses, all county government offices, martial arts halls, schools, and temples were demolished. The people fled to the deep mountains, and more than 2,000 people were searched and captured by the bandits. Civilian property and food were washed away as if by water. When the bandits ran out of food, they fled to Sichuan, and the people had no homes to return to. After the disaster, it was investigated that more than 4,000 people died from the bandits, epidemics, hunger, and cold. In the autumn of the nineteenth year, the weather was out of sync, the sweet potatoes rotted, and the five grains were not harvested. Hail fell repeatedly in July and August, and there were droughts and floods from time to time. Various harvests were hopeless, and the number of people who fled before and after exceeded 10,000. People ate grass roots and tree bark to fill their hunger. When they had exhausted their searches, they ate Guanyin soil to prolong their lives. Many people died from constipation. They sold their children and wives, fearing they would be too late to sell them. Recently, a self-proclaimed garrison commander, Wang Guangzong, occupied Ankang and appointed his battalion deputy Liu Hongsui as the magistrate of Zhenping County, who was engaged in killing and extorting money every day. Later, Zhou Tieniu, the leader of the Pingli Red Spear Society, led a crowd to attack the county, killing people and looting the prison. The county town was looted. Magistrate Liu was also dragged to the middle of the road and shot dead. Now, the county town is desolate and the county government is vacant. The situation is extremely desolate. (May 15)</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Restricts Foreign Church Property</h3>
<p>Wuhu County Government Petitions for the Prohibition of Catholic Church Property</p>
<p>Instructions Approved to Buy and Resell to Chinese by Government Offices</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Yu Yuying, the magistrate of Wuhu County, learned that the Catholic Church in Wuhu has recently acquired a large amount of real estate, exceeding the scope of missionary work, which damages our country's sovereignty. He specifically submitted a petition to the Anhui Provincial Government, strongly requesting that it be prohibited by law, and drafted disposal measures to purchase it by the government office according to the contract price and resell it to Chinese buyers. The surplus funds will be used to run local public welfare projects. The provincial government has issued instructions to handle it as proposed and has appointed Zhang Yuncheng to investigate. It has been found that most of the buildings on Jihua Street owned by the Church have been sold, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan. The buildings around the Red Wall Courtyard are also being sold. The county government plans to follow the provincial order and dispose of the purchase to restore national rights. The original submission of the county government is as follows: "Following the regulations of the First Article of the Provisional Regulations on the Lease of Land and Buildings by Foreign Churches in the Interior issued by Your Department, foreign churches may rent land to construct or rent or buy houses in the name of the church to establish churches, hospitals, and schools. The meaning of the translation seems to be to specify that the lease of land and buildings by churches is solely for the purpose of establishing churches, hospitals, or schools, implying restrictions. Article 4 stipulates that foreign churches in the interior that lease land to construct or rent or buy buildings, and the area exceeds the necessary scope, the competent authority shall not approve. Article 5 stipulates that if it is found to be used for profit or business purposes, the competent authority may prohibit it or revoke the lease or purchase. Article 6 stipulates that land and buildings already occupied before the implementation of these regulations shall be reported to the competent authority for supplementation. It is clear that the land and buildings already rented by the church should also be reported in the form of supplementary reports, even before the implementation of these regulations. On the government's side, according to its report, it naturally has the right to review its use and impose the disapproval of Article 4 and the prohibition or revocation of its lease or purchase in Article 5. In summary, the entire text is that the provisional regulations are a concrete way to suppress foreign church property. All the rented and purchased houses and real estate owned by the Catholic Church in Wuhu, except for the church located in Fahua Temple, and those around the Red Wall Courtyard, the number of houses purchased is estimated to be no less than several hundred. In addition, there are areas near the Hubei Guild Hall and other locations, which are countless. The houses and real estate purchased by the church not only exceed the necessary scope for missionary work, but also are clearly used for profit and business purposes, and the number is alarmingly large. The provisions of the first, fourth, and fifth articles of the aforementioned provisional regulations are obviously inconsistent and should be punished to strictly prohibit and show restrictions, etc." (22nd)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick Mail</h3>
<p>Last night (21st), seven bandits suddenly arrived at the Wuhu Mitsubishi Company Asia Petroleum Company, each holding handguns and Mauser pistols. They broke into the company, first injuring the gatekeeper and patrolman of the company, and then broke into the inner room, looting wildly. A total of more than eighty yuan in paper money, more than one thousand copper coins, and clothes and jewelry were robbed. They left swaggeringly. Zhao Jingshi, the director of the Public Security Bureau, has ordered his subordinates to strictly investigate after receiving the report. In addition, several bandits also arrived at Liu Debiao's house in the eighth ward of Beixiang last night, robbing more than one hundred yuan in silver dollars and clothing. The victim has reported the case to the city today.</p>
<p>The First Battalion of the 57th Division stationed in Wuhu, Xu Guoting's Regiment, was dispatched to Dangtu to suppress bandits a few days ago. It has defeated the bandits in Qingshan and other places and captured two suspected bandits, Tao Guocai and Ye Liwu. Today, a team was sent to escort them to Wuhu and send them to the regimental headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>The teachers and staff of the various elementary schools in Wuhu County, due to the lack of teaching funds, found it difficult to maintain operations. They jointly appealed to the county government and education bureau, requesting the allocation of funds for relief. So far, there has been no result. Therefore, all the teachers and staff of the schools, including Bao Rulan, Ding Yinghua, Shen Caixia, Jin Yijie, and more than 20 others, went to the county government and education bureau again today to petition. Director Zheng Shangyuan has promised to borrow money from the Finance Bureau for distribution.</p>
<p>Li Gengchang, the Wuhu Customs Superintendent, previously received an order from the Ministry of Finance to close the Changguan (regular customs) in the Five Wuxu Port and other places. On the 22nd, he issued a notice together with the Tax Affairs Director, approving the implementation of the abolition of the regular customs in the Five Locations on June 1st. He also sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce to inform the various merchant guilds. (22nd)</p>

It was resolved that when Jiuzhou starts work, the industry association will work with the vocational union to discuss and handle it. (1) The wages that the factories have not paid in full before March of this year should be paid off as soon as possible. The deadline for paying wages in the future should be based on the end of the lunar month. It was resolved that the date of wage payment should be reserved first. The vocational union will issue a list of arrears of wages to the industry association and forward it to the limited-time payment. If the limit is exceeded, the county will be requested to issue it. (1) The factory should be responsible for compensating for the daily loss of workers who are fired without reason, and shall not threaten workers to withdraw from the union, or insult the staff of the union.

<h3>Merchants in Various Industries Subscribe to Business Tax</h3>
<p>Merchants in various industries in Wu County are subscribing to the Wu County business tax as a whole. The county chamber of commerce is investigating the business volume of each industry. It is heard that more than 40 industries have reported to the chamber of commerce, totaling more than 19 million yuan, and the business tax to be paid is more than 38,000 yuan. There are more than 30 industries with a smaller scope that have not reported to the chamber of commerce. After they are all reported, the procedures for subscribing will be contacted with the province. However, the tax amount is about 100,000 yuan in Wu County, which is far from the reported amount of each industry. Therefore, it is not yet known whether it can become a reality. The Business Tax Collection Bureau here received a telegram from the Finance Department on the 24th, stating that the Wu County business tax was previously proposed to be paid by the chamber of commerce, and it is urgent to resolve it as soon as possible. It is hoped that the exact amount of subscription will be drafted before the 25th of this month, and the director will be accompanied to the department to discuss it in order to finalize the plan, etc. Director Wang immediately informed the Chamber of Commerce for review.</p>
<h3>Water and Land Police Vigorously Suppress Lake Bandits</h3>
<p>In the Hengjing area of Jiangsu Province, a large group of lake bandits was discovered on the 23rd. The Third District Water Police dispatched a large team to the area to join forces with the Tenth, Twenty-fourth, and Forty-fifth Squads to launch a major suppression. At 9:00 AM that morning, more than twenty bandit ships from Puyuan Town in Zhejiang Province arrived, carrying over two hundred bandits. They landed and searched houses one by one, kidnapping five hostages. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, at Yanmu Township on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the "Xiangfeng" small steamer traveling from Pinghu to Zhenze was also intercepted by bandits, who kidnapped four female hostages and fled to Maoqi Port and Sitingzi in Wujiang. After the valiant pursuit by the water and land military police, they encountered the bandits near Sitingzi and exchanged fire. After an hour, one bandit ship and one bandit were captured. Subsequently, four more bandit ships were captured, along with six bandits. Due to lack of ammunition, the bandits retreated towards Wusong Port. The Third District Water Police Chief, Shen, dispatched auxiliary warships and six gunboats on the 24th to join the water and land police teams and encircle the area, hoping to completely eliminate the bandits in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3>Bandits Attempt Arson and Robbery at Night</h3>
<p>In the urban area outside the North Gate of this county, arson by bandits has occurred for several nights, with the intention of robbing large amounts of goods. This is causing deep concern in the community. It is hoped that the authorities will conduct a thorough investigation to ensure peace and tranquility for the society. Details are recorded below: (1) At the residence of Zhang Xizhen, No. 3 Niansan Lane, Jiegaoting, Beitang, several bundles of rice straw were burned, but the fire was extinguished in time. (2) At the residence of Li Dongyang, No. 2 Niansan Lane, the right-side gate was burned down. (3) At the residence of Pan Jinyi, No. 15 Niansan Lane, the left-side gate and two wooden ladders were burned, and one cotton-padded jacket and one short shirt were robbed, along with a thermos, which was abandoned when someone noticed. The purpose of the arson was to take the opportunity to rob. According to the reporter's investigation, the firewood of Zhang Xizhen and others was piled up under the door. The bandits set fire through the door cracks and then knocked on the doors of the neighbors, shouting "Fire!" When the neighbors opened their doors, they saw the fire next door and rushed to save their belongings. The bandits also took the opportunity to rob. The maliciousness of their plan is truly shocking. The other day, Zhang Xizhen and others reported the situation to the Beitang Xizhen Township Office. Township Chief Cai Jihui reported it to the First District Office, which forwarded it to the county for investigation and arrest. At the same time, a letter was sent to Peng Xiwen, the Chief of the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, requesting him to order the police to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators to maintain social security.</p>
<h3>Business Tax Assessment for Various Industries</h3>
<p>The collection of business tax by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance is actively underway. Previously, when representatives from various county chambers of commerce in Jiangsu Province held a joint meeting in the province, the representative from this county's chamber of commerce proposed that the assessment method for business tax should be determined by each industry and each township. This proposal was unanimously agreed upon by the county representatives and submitted to the provincial government for approval. It is now learned that in this county, the industries with assessed amounts include machine sand-turning, foreign goods, woodworking, shipping, and tea, totaling fifty-two industries. The towns with assessed amounts include Qianzhou, Dangkou, and Anzhen. The factories with assessed amounts include Gongda Brick and Tile Factory, Wang Yuanchang Smelting Workshop, and Chengtai Stone Powder Factory. The highest assessed amount is two thousand yuan, and the lowest is fifty yuan, totaling thirty-nine thousand five hundred and fifty-two yuan. However, this is still far from the amount stipulated by the province.</p>
<h3>Arrest Warrant Issued for Apprentice Who Stole Gold Jewelry</h3>
<p>Chen Rongdu (also known as Chen Longda), an apprentice in the jewelry room of the Nanqiao Hebao Pawnshop in the Third District (Yangming Township) of this county, stole a large batch of gold jewelry on the 8th of this month, worth over seven thousand yuan. He has been on the run ever since and has not been found. The pawnshop manager, Wang Chuankui, sent a letter to the pawnshop guild, which forwarded it to the county government for arrest. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Pan ordered the Public Security Bureau, the Police Team, and the Political Police to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrator to bring him to justice. He also ordered a public announcement to be made to all pawnshop customers to be aware of the situation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The Murder Case Outside the West Gate Concludes. The case of the suspected death of Shen Fugen outside the West Gate has been re-examined by the county government. The examination determined that he died of typhus. However, he was previously beaten by Wang Erguan, so Wang is still in custody. The details of the incident have been recorded in this paper. The county government sent a police officer on the 23rd at 4:00 PM to bring the detained Wang Erguan to court. After questioning his age and occupation, the court announced the verdict and read out the main text, stating that Wang Erguan did not intentionally harm anyone, but did injure a person's body. He was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. The number of days he was detained before the judgment was confirmed would be counted as two days for each day. After reading the verdict, the court also stated that if he did not agree with the judgment, he could appeal to the Wuxian District Court. Wang Erguan was then taken back into custody. Wang then hired lawyer Di Rou to write an appeal to the Wuxian District Court.</p>

<h3>Eleventh Division Sends Wounded Soldiers to Tong for Vocational Training</h3>
<p>The Eleventh Division stationed in Hankou has appointed Zhuang Mingyuan to Tong to take over the pauper's factory and convert it into a vocational training factory for wounded soldiers. Local circles strongly opposed this plan. The petitioning representatives are still in Beijing and have not returned. On the 23rd, the first batch of wounded soldiers sent for vocational training, including eighty-four officers and soldiers, landed at Lujing Port and went directly to the pauper's factory. That evening, representatives from all sectors held an emergency meeting at the county government. Tao Junshan and Cheng Yunke were appointed to negotiate with Zhuang. Before the property rights of the pauper's factory are resolved, the wounded soldiers will temporarily reside at the Sacrifice Altar in the east of the city. Negotiations continued until late at night, but no results were achieved.</p>
<h3>Relief for County Funds Shortage</h3>
<p>Nantong's local funds are severely short. There are substantial arrears in political and police expenses. County Magistrate Zhang, together with the Finance Bureau and the Property Management Office, negotiated with the financial community on the 23rd to seek relief measures. A short-term loan was established. The Finance Bureau borrowed 35,000 yuan, and the Property Management Office borrowed 30,000 yuan, both secured by this year's busy season grain transport revenue. The principal and interest are to be repaid in six months at an interest rate of eight percent.</p>

<h3>Teachers Demand Salary Meeting</h3>
<p>Teachers of various primary schools in the city have not received their salaries for more than six months.

<h3>Attempted Kidnapping of Doctor, Bandit Apprehended</h3>
<p>The president of Jiaxing Hospital, Xia Zhenwen, was invited to treat a patient at No. 16 Xieqiao Street in the city the other day. He was threatened by two young men who demanded 2,000 yuan. Xia managed to escape by design. The other day, Xia received a threatening letter at the hospital demanding payment within a time limit. The County Public Security Bureau learned of the matter and ordered the police to search the address. One woman was arrested. The names of the young men were identified, and a search was launched. It is now known that the Public Security Bureau, in addition to ordering the police to search for the perpetrators inside and outside the city, prepared an official document and dispatched patrol team leader Chen Peishun to lead police officers to Jiashan for investigation. They encountered the perpetrators, Qian Yipeng and Wang Yaohua, at the Jiashan Railway Station. Team Leader Chen cooperated with the security team stationed at the station to arrest Qian and Chen.

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Xu Ye Xiaomei</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read the article "The Course of the Trial of the Xu Zhuoran Assassination Case Handled by the Hangzhou Court" in the Ninth Edition of your newspaper on May 23rd, which is completely untrue. The case of my husband, Zhuoran, being brutally assassinated by Ye Caizhen and others was thoroughly investigated on the spot by Prosecutor Ouyang, specially appointed by the Supreme Court, and in cooperation with the Hangzhou County Court Prosecutor's Office. A public prosecution was filed, and the trial was held six times. The evidence against Ye Caizhen and others is conclusive. Among the notable points are: (1) Whether the murderer was lying in ambush and by whom he was ambushed has been clearly demonstrated. (2) The bullets and the murderer's confessions match each other. (3) Ye Caizhen's letters of hatred towards my husband have also been seized. Witnesses and material evidence are all complete. The reason why the Hangzhou Court has been delayed in rendering a verdict is that Ye's side is deliberately presenting absurd evidence in the hope of delaying the sentencing, on the one hand, and creating a false impression and misleading the public with false words, attempting to escape the law. I am truly afraid of reversing right and wrong and confusing social hearing. Therefore, I specifically request your newspaper to uphold justice and grant a correction. Sincerely, Xu Ye Xiaomei, May 24th. Education News</p>
<h3>Important News About Hong Kong's Primary and Secondary School Curriculum</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to improve the teaching of various subjects in Hong Kong's primary and secondary schools and revise the current school registration procedures, notified the Guangdong Provincial Government: According to the report submitted by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education on the investigation of the management of public and private secondary schools in Hong Kong and the curriculum standards, the Ministry has found that there are as many as 54 public and private secondary schools in Hong Kong. Their organization, equipment, and teachers are mostly inconsistent with the current domestic laws and regulations, and the secondary school curriculum standards they have set are particularly inappropriate, such as: (1) Subjects such as physiology, hygiene, botany, zoology, chemistry, music, drawing, and physical education are completely absent in both junior and senior high schools. (2) Confucian classics are at the top of the curriculum and are required for all six years of junior and senior high school. (3) In addition to textbooks, Chinese language focuses on teaching poetry and prose for all six years of junior and senior high school. (4) Physics and mineralogy are listed in junior high school, but not in senior high school. (5) In addition to Confucian classics, Chinese language, history, geography, mathematics, and English, there are no natural sciences or other subjects in the senior high school curriculum. This type of standard not only does not meet modern needs, but also hinders the proper development of young people's minds and bodies. The study of Confucian classics is profound and esoteric and cannot be understood by children. Our country's current education system is for specialized research in universities, and there are no teachers of Confucian classics in primary and secondary schools. Natural sciences and art and physical education are compulsory courses in general education. They are no different from language, mathematics, history, and geography. Moreover, in the current development of education in our country, the status of science education is becoming increasingly important. Each middle school is paying more and more attention to the educational facilities of natural science in various aspects to meet the needs of the times. This Ministry has formulated and promulgated the Interim Standards for Primary and Secondary School Curriculum, which are uniformly followed by primary and secondary schools across the country. Overseas Chinese schools also follow them, because this standard integrates the general education systems of various countries in the world and meets the needs of the Chinese nation. All our children and young people should receive the education provided according to this standard. It is believed that the Hong Kong government has not yet fully understood this situation, resulting in the fact that the measures for managing public and private primary and secondary schools and the curriculum standards set by its Education Department are not adapted to the development of local education in Hong Kong. Therefore, this Ministry specially sends to your Provincial Government copies of the current important laws and regulations for primary and secondary schools and the Interim Standards for Primary and Secondary School Curriculum promulgated by the Ministry, requesting that you forward them to the Hong Kong government and ask them to investigate and revise the current school registration procedures in Hong Kong and order the public and private primary and secondary schools under its jurisdiction to follow the primary and secondary school curriculum standards promulgated by this Ministry to improve the teaching of various subjects, enrich school facilities to meet needs, and seek progress. If the Hong Kong government wishes to understand the development of education in our country in the future, this Ministry is willing to inform them at any time in order to exchange information and promote friendship. In addition to instructing the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education, we are copying the original presentation and notifying your Provincial Government to investigate and handle the matter, and hope to receive a reply.</p>
<h3>Ministry Orders Publication of Seals for Public Schools</h3>
<p>According to the report submitted by the Jiangsu Education Department requesting instructions on whether public schools should publish seals, the Ministry of Education issued instructions stating: Article 11 of the General Outline of Public School Measures stipulates that graduation certificates from public schools should be issued by the school. Therefore, the provisions of Article 3 of the Measures for Issuing Seals of Educational Institutions should be followed, and seals should be published for application, so as to establish credibility.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Investigates Elementary Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education is investigating elementary education across the country and issuing survey forms and instructions for filling out the forms, notifying the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities. The Ministry previously issued survey forms to understand the general situation of elementary education across the country and ordered the report on the general situation of elementary education for the 18th year to be filled out. Now, as the end of the 19th school year is approaching, the status of elementary education for this year should be investigated to allow for statistics. The Ministry has revised, reprinted, and issued the prescribed form and instructions for filling out the form for the previous year. In addition to separate orders, we hereby issue ten copies of the form and instructions for filling out the form, ordering the department to imitate the form and distribute it to subordinates for accurate reporting and submission. This is imperative. This order.</p>

<h3>Speeches by Cai Jiemin and Others</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM, everyone enjoyed free discussion in the lounge, warmly hosted by Shanghai University President Liu Zhan'en and the students. The lounge was magnificently decorated with fragrant and vibrant flowers adorning the walls, a feast for the eyes. After the break, everyone took their seats, and Zheng Zhangcheng, representing the Department of Biology at Shanghai University, delivered a heartfelt welcome speech. President Liu Zhan'en's welcome speech was also filled with encouragement. Following this, Cai Yuanpei gave a speech, frequently citing classical texts to demonstrate that the Chinese have always had a spirit and interest in biological research. He also stated that China's vast territory and diverse range of organisms make it a naturally great and complete research environment. Furthermore, biology has a regional character, and with the spirit of mutual assistance and research among the members of this association, it has already held such a lively academic conference within one year of its history. In the future, its development will showcase the unique characteristics of Chinese biology and contribute greatly to the nation and the world. Although the Academia Sinica, being recently established, does not yet have a biological research institute, it has sent people to the southwest and northwest to collect specimens on multiple occasions within its capabilities. Even for the purpose of organizing the specimens, it has been necessary to purchase books and instruments to meet the needs of the work, which is also a preparation for the future establishment of a biological research institute, and so on. Other Chinese and foreign members and guests who had traveled from afar also gave speeches. After the speeches, Xu Fengxi gave a speech on behalf of the association to express gratitude. Finally, Li Guochang reported on the association's ongoing plans. At 3:00 PM, a group photo was taken, and Shanghai University was toured.</p>

<h3>Route Slightly Different</h3>
<p>Yesterday was traditionally the Buddha Bathing Festival, and the Jing'an Temple was exceptionally lively, making passage inconvenient. Therefore, the section of Jing'an Temple Road was moved to Connaught Road, and the starting point was also moved forward to the Tongfu Road intersection. The entire route was as follows: Start from the Tongfu Road intersection of Jing'an Temple Road, walk along Gordon Road to Connaught Road, go straight to Brenan Road and Robison Road, turn back to Hongqiao Road, North Wan Yao Catholic Church Road, Avenue Joffre, and then to Route Petain and Route Lafayette, north into Avenue du Roi Albert, west straight onto Weihaiwei Road, pass Route Mahol, and enter the front of the Race Course grandstand to terminate. The entire route was seventeen miles and one hundred yards long.</p>
<p>It rained heavily the night before, and it only cleared up at dawn, but it was still drizzling at the start. The Zhoujia Bridge section at the end of Connaught Road was all muddy. Cars splashed dirty water when driving on it. The section over the railway and Robison Road was all concrete, and it was slippery after the rain, and the runners all complained.</p>
<h3>Gunshot Start</h3>
<p>After roll call, the lineup began to move. Because of the change to Connaught Road, the starting point was moved forward to the Tongfu Road intersection. After Chinese and foreign detectives and Western Boy Scouts organized the order of the route, it was already 8:15 AM. Paisley fired a shot, and sixty-eight heroes fought to be in front, entering Gordon Road from Jing'an Temple Road. Remidey, Zhou Yuyu, and Zhou Ruquan were all in the front row, advancing forward. Situation along the way</p>
<h3>Extremely Swift Road, Each Running Their Own Course</h3>
<p>From Gordon Road into Connaught Road, was the first section of the entire route. Zhou Ruquan led the way, and when he reached the Jisi Fei Road vegetable market at 8:22 AM, Zhou Ruquan, Wang Zhenglin, and Long Zexian were side by side, three feet ahead of Mian Kuang. Kelo Caizi and Huang Shengbai, and the Indian Hanson Xin were behind them. Zhou Yuyu was about ten feet behind, and the order behind them was Dong Jiaxie, Chen Xuzhou, Zhang Zhengchang, Lv Fa Lei, Teke, Ma Xu, Hu Dingli, Remidey, far behind. Song Zean stuck to Remidey and advanced. The vast journey ahead, at this time, it was still unknown who would win.</p>
<h3>Along the Suzhou Creek, Athletes Like a Line</h3>
<p>Passing the railway, was the later section of Brenan Road. Passing the wooden bridge, walking along the Suzhou Creek, one side was low houses with small trees, the scenery was very good. The athletes proceeded in a line, which was very spectacular from a distance. The route was five miles long. At that time it was 8:45 AM, and the order was as follows: Zhou Ruquan, Wang Zhenglin, Long Zexian, Huang Shengbai, four people, advancing side by side, Ruquan in front, Kelo Caizi, fifty yards behind, and behind them were Ma Xu, Zhou Yuyu, Chen Xuzhou, Song Zean, Salozifu, Teke, Bao Lie Tuo, and Remidey was still far behind.</p>
<h3>On Hongqiao Road, Old General Flies Forward</h3>
<p>After Robison Road, turn into Hongqiao Road, which is eight miles, half the entire journey. In this course, those who want to win must speed up here. Remidey, the old general, was in great style, and his speed suddenly increased. His pace quickened, and Chen Xuzhou and Zhou Yuyu and Song Zean were chased out one by one, becoming seventh place. The speed was like running 400 meters. At that time, the order was as follows: Zhou Ruquan, Huang Shengbai, Wang Zhenglin, Long Zexian, Ma Xu, Kelo Caizi, and fifty meters behind was Remidey, followed by Song Zean, Zhou Yuyu, Chen Xu Bai, Salozifu, Lv Pulei Teke, Dong Jiaxie, Zhou Ruquan. The time was 9:00 AM. The long and straight Hongqiao Road was a good path to the front. Remidey quickened his pace again, chasing out Kelo Caizi and Ma Xu, and was almost the same distance as Long and Huang.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Champion Rises Straight Up</h3>
<p>Passing Route Petain, running has reached the gate of Jiaotong University, a distance of twelve miles, four-fifths of the entire journey has been completed. Long Zexian and Huang Shengbai ran side by side. Remidey had accelerated to catch up to this point, only thirty feet away. Zhou Ruquan was fifty yards behind. Another fifty yards behind was Kelo Caizi, three hundred yards away, Zhou Yuyu and Chen Xuzhou advanced side by side, and the following order was: Salozifu, Lv Pulei, Song Zean, Wang Zhenglin, Tete, Tang Wending, Teke, Maikuntu, Niu Yingtian.</p>
<h3>Avenue du Roi Albert, Smooth Sailing All the Way</h3>
<p>Remidey advanced to third place, following closely behind. Entering Avenue du Roi Albert, only two miles away from the finish line. Remidey's pace was even faster, snatching Long Huang, and from then on, he led the way, seventy yards in front of Long. Although Long tried his best to catch up, he was exhausted and could do nothing. Remidey was more than adequate, and won the championship.</p>
<h3>Situation at the Start of the Race</h3>
<p>The right corner is the winning member (1) Remidey (2) Long Zexian</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Finish Line</h3>
<p>The clock was already 10:00 AM, Weihaiwei Road, people's heads were moving, the atmosphere was tense, cars arrived one after another, knowing that the champion was coming,</p>
<h3>Figure Seen at First</h3>
<p>The first person at the head, was Portuguese Remidey, unhurried, entering the Race Course, no one was competing, Long Zexian was behind, eighty yards away. Remidey came, applause rose greatly, and he won first place.</p>
<h3>Next Long Yixian</h3>
<p>Thirty seconds passed, and Long Zexian followed closely, about seventy or eighty yards apart. Alas, Huang Shengbai was another hundred yards behind, and Zhou Ruquan was another four or five hundred yards behind. After that, they arrived in order. Second to sixth, were all Chinese, which is also a source of pride.</p>
<h3>Grand Award Ceremony</h3>
<p>| Remidey Wins Zhang Qun Cup |</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, the award ceremony was held in front of the grandstand. The spectators were surrounded by thousands of people, especially Chinese ladies and gentlemen, accounting for eight or nine tenths. A radio broadcasting machine was set up on the stage. First,</p>
<h3>President Pei En Delivered a Speech</h3>
<p>Saying that the marathon long-distance run, is now the third time, looking back at the initial hard work when it was first initiated, and being able to see today's grand occasion is very happy. Last year, only twenty-two people joined, and this year, there are sixty-eight people, and the development can be seen. I hope this development will continue. Among the sixty-eight people, almost all finished the walk, only sooner or later.</p>
<h3>Chinese Spirit is Commendable</h3>
<p>In addition to the first place, two, three, four and five belong to them. The marathon long-distance race has such a grand occasion, and the Chinese have given a lot of support, and Mayor Zhang Qun's special award of a large silver cup is especially appreciated. Again, I have to</p>
<h3>Congratulate Mr. Remidey</h3>
<p>Looking at his success, in the first session held in 1929, he won first place, and his score was 1 hour and 48 minutes. Last year, he was second, and his score was 1 hour, 49 minutes and 38 seconds, only three seconds behind the first place. This year's result is due to the rain and the muddy road is difficult to walk, and getting this is not easy. Finally, I would like to thank all the sponsors and contributors. Then</p>

Discussed the selection of Chinese team members and participation in this year's International Games. The meeting lasted for two hours. First, the committee members reviewed the results of this year's major sports games, carefully discussed, and selected track and field athletes to participate in the conference. It was found that the conference registration limited each country to five people. Except for the six items of 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters, 800 meters, shot put, and high jump, the number of people has been filled. For the rest, there is still one person or two vacancies.

<h3>Black and White Again Defeats John</h3>
<p>| 45 to 24 |</p>
<p>Tonight at 8:00 PM to Fight the White Team</p>
<p>The Black and White Basketball Team, in the first battle the night before, defeated Shanghai University. Last night at 8:00 PM, with the remaining power of the victory, they defeated John by a large margin of 45 to 24. The first half was 12 to 14, the second half was 24 to 10, the total comparison was 45 to 24. The audience was more than the night before because it was a Sunday. There were about 400 people. In last night's battle, John was always at a disadvantage. Except for scoring a goal first after the start of the game, they never raised their eyebrows. Although they worked hard, they were ultimately unable to do anything because they rarely practiced together on weekdays, and the opportunity to respond was not sensitive. However, in terms of the individual's ball skills, none of them are veterans on the battlefield. Tang Baokun of Black and White, was the right forward yesterday, and the Shen brothers, Yu Gong and Yu Qin, attacked back and forth, making it difficult for John to resist. With the help of the two defenders, Li Qingyun and Liang Mingzong, who frequently provided assistance, the momentum became even stronger. Tang Baokun and Shen Yuqin scored the most points. Tang had fifteen points, and Yuqin had eighteen points. Tang's penalty kick was especially accurate, and Yuqin's throws were adaptable. John was under close surveillance, and it was extremely difficult to score. Lu Zhongen did his best, tall and powerful, and often took advantage. When the ball was in the air, it was intercepted halfway. Diao Youdao and Chen Xianglong desperately attacked, scoring more points, and the rest of the generals were also exhausted.</p>
<p>Tonight at 8:00 PM, the Black and White team will fight the White team (ie, Chizhi) in the China Basketball Hall. The referee is Zhang Guoxun.</p>

<h3>Chinese Meat Merchants Resume Suspension of Business</h3>
<p>The Finance Bureau Cannot Assume Responsibility for Counting</p>
<p>Meat Merchants in Both the North and South of Shanghai Stop Importing Again</p>
<p>The fresh meat industry in this city suspended business due to the slaughter tax issue. After mediation by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, meat merchants in the concessions resumed business first. Chinese meat merchants originally planned to resume slaughtering yesterday, but suspended importing again and resumed suspension of business because the Finance Bureau would not assume responsibility for counting. The various situations yesterday are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce persuaded the fresh meat industry to resume business first, and all slaughter tax amounts would be temporarily counted and guaranteed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, pending resolution and supplementary payment. In addition to writing to the Finance Bureau, General Secretary Zheng Chengqing was also sent to negotiate to prevent the confiscation of pigs. However, the Finance Bureau stated that it could not be held responsible and needed to request instructions from the Municipal Government on whether the confiscation of pigs could be waived. Upon receiving a reply, he immediately returned to the Chamber of Commerce and informed the Fresh Meat Industry Association of the situation. The association immediately instructed its members and sent Wang Jinwen and Mao Bin to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting prompt assistance and explaining in detail the reasons for the unavoidable resumption of suspension of business.</p>
<h3>Stopping Imports</h3>
<p>After receiving notification from the Industry Association, meat merchants from both the north and south of Shanghai and the four surrounding areas flocked to the market yesterday to import goods in preparation for reopening. The Shanghai North Slaughterhouse on Minli Road, the South Slaughterhouse in Xuejiabang, and the slaughterhouses in Tangqiao, Zhenru, Gaoqiao, Jiangwan, Wusong, Beixinjing, Xujiahui, Yangjing, Yinhang, Caojiadu, and other places cleaned their tools in preparation for slaughtering. However, when the meat merchants heard that the Finance Bureau would not allow temporary counting and would not waive the confiscation of pigs, they immediately stopped importing. However, the goods that had already been imported were temporarily held back from slaughter. As a result, there was still no fresh meat on the market in the Chinese areas today.</p>
<h3>Another Wave of Panic</h3>
<p>He Laiqing and Zhang Fuchen, Jiangbei pig merchants residing in Shanghai, and 1,326 others, believed that their capital would be completely lost due to the suspension of business by the fresh meat industry, and requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to mediate and save the merchants from disaster. Upon hearing that the meat merchants had resumed business, they immediately telegraphed the interior to send pigs to Shanghai. The Fresh Pig Industry Association was affected by the suspension of business by the fresh meat industry and requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to vigorously mediate. Upon hearing of the resumption of suspension of business yesterday, they were once again thrown into panic.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Merchants Respond</h3>
<p>The Fresh Meat Industry Association received a telegram yesterday from the joint office of the fresh meat industry in various counties of Jiangsu, which stated: "Telegram to the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association: We have read the report stating that your association is striving to abolish the slaughter tax and miscellaneous levies and taxes and requesting to change to a business tax, which has caused the city's meat merchants to suspend business. Our association has convened a meeting of the industry to discuss assistance and has sent a letter of consolation. We have found that Article 11 of the supplementary measures to the Jiangsu Province's business tax collection outline states: 'Taxes on brokers, pawnshops, slaughterhouses, and other taxes with the same nature as business taxes, although they have been incorporated separately according to the outline, may be handled in two steps in order to temporarily add them to local revenue in the original plan. The first step is to rename taxes on brokers, pawnshops, slaughterhouses, etc., as business tax, and their tax rates will be a temporary transitional measure. The second step is, after the business tax is ready, to change the original tax rates to be collected according to the business tax rates, so as to unify them.' Now that the business tax is about to be levied, the business tax in our county is decided by the county chamber of commerce convening various industries to discuss and individually subscribe to the entire amount, etc.' We are thinking that the day of abolition is approaching, and the second step will arrive. However, recently your county suddenly changed the method of collection and took this legitimate action. Our association highly agrees. All of us in the meat industry swear to strive for consistency. Our association is willing to be the backing. We hope you will work hard to proceed. We hereby send a telegram of support. Please take note."</p>
<h3>Sand and Gravel Industry Temporarily Does Not Suspend Business</h3>
<p>Result of the Association's Persuasion</p>
<p>The sand and gravel industry in this city suspended business due to the Zhejiang Province tax issue. After resuming business, they were forced to donate by the Dachang contractor and planned to suspend business again. The situation yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce's Reply</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Sand and Gravel Industry Association yesterday, stating: "Regarding your association's letter of the 22nd, requesting that we forward a request to the Party and government organs to stop the collection of sand and gravel management fees similar to likin tax. We have found that this case is still pending approval from the Social Affairs Bureau because the contractor has not complied with the order to stop collecting. It has only been two days since the case was submitted on the 20th, and we should wait patiently for approval."</p>
<h3>Association's Persuasion</h3>
<p>After the resumption of business by more than a thousand sand and gravel companies, the contractor Dachang forcibly collected fees from sand boats coming to Shanghai, causing widespread resentment. They were originally planning to suspend business again to show resistance. Yesterday, the Industry Association held a regular meeting with more than ten people in attendance. Chairman Lu Xiaozuo decided to copy the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and distribute it to all members for compliance. The members received the notification and continued to unload goods as usual, but Dachang is still monopolizing sand boats and extorting donations, it is said.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation Plans Shanghai-Manchuria Flight Schedule</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Launch at the End of This Month</p>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation has decided to start flights on the 31st of this month. According to Sun Mutang, secretary of the company, in an interview with a reporter from the Nichinichi Shimbun, before the Sino-Soviet issue is resolved, passengers will be transported by Russian train between Manchuria and Moscow. After the Sino-Soviet issue is resolved, our country's planes will still fly from Shanghai to Manchuria, and German-Russian Aviation's planes will transport passengers from Manchuria to Germany. It is estimated that it will take about eight days to travel from Shanghai to Germany. After the Sino-Soviet issue is resolved, the round trip will only take four days. By sea, it would take more than fifty days, a vast difference. The flight schedule is now set as follows: Upbound (Shanghai to Manchuria): Depart from Shanghai station at 5:00 AM, arrive at Nalian at 6:45 AM, stay until 7:30 AM and depart again, arrive at Jinan at 11:15 AM, depart from Jinan at 12:00 PM, arrive at Beiping at 2:30 PM, depart from Beiping at 3:00 PM, arrive at Linxi at 6:30 PM. There will be an overnight stay in Linxi and depart at 6:00 AM the next morning, arriving in Manchuria at 12:00 PM. The section from Linxi to Manchuria is the most difficult to fly and the longest. The road is rugged with mountains and strange rocks, so it is not suitable for flying at night. Therefore, it is necessary to fly again the next morning. After arriving in Manchuria, the Siberian train will depart, and passengers and mail can be unloaded onto the train. Downbound (Manchuria to Shanghai): Depart at 9:00 AM, arrive at Linxi at 3:00 PM, arrive at Beiping at 7:15 PM, stay overnight, depart at 4:00 AM the next morning, arrive at Jinan at 6:30 AM, arrive at Nanjing at 11:00 AM, arrive at Shanghai at 1:00 PM. There will be two flights per week, on Wednesdays and Sundays. The company originally planned to invite people from all walks of life to visit the Hongqiao Airport at the end of this month, but due to the recent continuous rain, the airport has accumulated water and turned into a ditch, forming a swamp, which will be difficult to dry out in the near future. Therefore, the invitation may have to be postponed. The area where the planes are currently parked has been covered with several feet of coal dust to avoid moisture, it is said.</p>
<h3>Promoting Domestic Timber</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Circular to Various Industries for Procurement</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified various industries related to construction and building to use domestic timber. The original letter stated: "We have received a directive from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which was forwarded from the National Government's directive, which was forwarded from the petition of Yu Mujun and others, standing committee members of the Nanjing Timber Industry Association, stating that foreign goods are flooding the market and business is declining, listing the difficulties they are facing and requesting that the National Government be instructed to vigorously promote domestic timber to provide relief and maintain domestic production. Since the opening of trade, many industries in our country have been affected by foreign goods and business has declined, but none have been as greatly affected and as deeply distressed as the timber industry. Moreover, in recent years, the trend has been that engineers and builders must use wooden products and cannot choose domestic products, all worshiping imported foreign wood and pine, while abandoning domestic western wood, Guangdong wood, pine, and miscellaneous trees. For the sake of convenience and calculation, they do not know that domestic materials are stronger and cheaper than foreign goods. If domestic production is not sufficient, foreign goods can be used as a substitute. The people of our country do not consider this, which is regrettable. Therefore, in recent times, some timber industry members have found it difficult to sustain themselves, or have even gone bankrupt. If a remedy is not taken quickly, domestic timber will have no way to be sold. Although the government has followed the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen to promote afforestation, the sales of timber are sluggish and afforestation is equivalent to abandonment, which not only affects people's livelihoods but also affects national taxes. At this time when the new import tariff is being implemented, it is a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. After careful consideration, we have no choice but to list the difficulties and request that the National Government be instructed to vigorously promote the use of domestic timber for all national agencies and construction committees engineers, regardless of building houses or daily use of wooden products. If domestic goods are not sufficient, foreign goods can be used as a substitute. This will set an example for the people, and the trend can be changed over time. This will not only avoid the harm of the outflow of rights and interests, but also support the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood and the practical teachings of afforestation, so that the future of the timber and bamboo industries can rely on this for relief. In addition to sending a direct petition to the Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, we are concerned that it may be difficult to expedite the process if the case is consolidated and forwarded. Therefore, we are making a special presentation for review and approval to maintain domestic production. We cannot wait for orders with urgent anticipation.' According to this, in recent years, many buildings, houses, wooden products, and other projects have purchased foreign wood and rarely used domestic products. The disadvantages are not only that merchants and business are declining, but also that the national economy is being greatly harmed. The association's listing of difficulties is true, and the relief measures are also practical and feasible after careful review by our department. It is reasonable to submit a document for review and forwarding to the National Government for compliance. It is for the public good.' According to this, it should be approved as requested to maintain domestic goods. In addition to issuing instructions, it is reasonable to submit a document to your government for review and implementation. Instructions are respectfully obeyed.' According to this, the association should be instructed to comply. We have heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent separate letters to the industries concerned, urging them to vigorously promote procurement."</p>

<h3>Letter from the Native Cloth Industry Association to Wang Yansong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Native Cloth Industry Association sent a letter to Wang Yansong, a representative of the Shanghai business community attending the People's Assembly, regarding the tax exemption for native cloth, stating: "With respect, our association has repeatedly petitioned the authorities and argued with the customs over the tax exemption for native cloth. The matter has dragged on for a long time and it has been difficult to get results. We were anxiously helpless when your representative was elected to attend the People's Assembly. You deeply considered the livelihoods of the poor and earnestly pleaded with the authorities, which allowed the situation to turn around. The two-month case was resolved in one day, which is a great achievement. On the 19th, we received the Ministry of Finance's telegram No. 1336, which stated: '(To the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association: We have noted your telegram. After investigation, it has been determined by the ministry that domestic handmade native cloth, when transported for sale to areas that have not implemented unified taxation and abroad, is now uniformly verified with a unified tax administration transportation permit to exempt customs duties to show consideration. We have ordered the customs to comply. Please take note. Printed by the Ministry of Finance). Upon receiving the approval, our association is fortunate that the losses suffered since February have been resolved. Although the government authorities attach importance to people's livelihoods and show consideration, things are different now than in the past. We cannot but thank you for your efforts on behalf of the merchants and citizens. Our association, on behalf of hundreds of thousands of poor farmers and machine operators, would like to express our heartfelt gratitude, etc.'"</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Operators Request Exemption from Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Operators Association sent a telegram yesterday to the Finance Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, citing regulations and requesting exemption from the business tax levied on the cocoon industry. Their telegram to the Jiangsu Finance Department stated: "We have received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that your department has issued a telegram stating that the business tax in this province will be levied on the cocoon industry. According to this, the raw materials required by our member silk factories are all purchased from the interior. The silkworm cocoons in spring, summer, and autumn are all for cocoon businesses to purchase the raw materials, and there is no business income. The Ministry of Finance issued Order No. 5754, which stated: 'The Tax Regulations Research Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Industry Association has telegraphed that tenants who only buy and do not sell, since they definitely have no business income, are naturally not subject to taxation.' It is very clear that cocoon businesses should not be subject to business tax. Even if we take a step back and assume that it can be subject to business tax, according to Article 11 of the supplementary measures, 'The transitional measure is to rename the broker tax as business tax, and the tax rate is collected according to the original amount of the broker tax.' All cocoon businesses in various places pay taxes and hold broker licenses. There is no doubt that cocoon businesses should not be subject to business tax again. Our association has already sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting correction. We hereby reiterate our request to your department to immediately issue a telegram to stop the business tax bureaus in this province from collecting business tax from cocoon businesses to comply with the government's orders and relieve the merchants' difficulties. It is for the public good, etc.'" Their wording in the telegram to the Zhejiang Finance Department was similar.</p>
<h3>Academic Society Holds Joint Discussion</h3>
<p>Inviting Celebrities to Give Lectures Every Week</p>
<p>The academic discussion society of the Youth Association's intellectual department, which is divided into literature, economics, politics, and society groups, has been established for a year. Each group has its own discussions and has achieved considerable results. Recently, the society held a joint discussion, inviting celebrities to give lectures every Sunday afternoon, with each group taking turns. The first time was yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, hosted by the literature group. The speaker was Professor Chen Wangdao of Fudan University, who spoke on the changes in modern literature and the relationship between literature and social issues in great detail. His main point was that before the May Fourth Movement, those who studied culture were rigid and unchanging, completely constrained by the ancients. After the May Fourth Movement, individuals became the main subject, and literature underwent a major change. Those who studied literature the most began to realize that their views could not escape the relationship with the social environment. As a result, literature changed to become socialized. Some people used to say that science is constantly evolving and is metabolic, while literature has permanence, like Liu Bang, the Emperor Gaozu of Han, writing, "The great wind rises, the clouds fly," which is still enjoyable to read thousands of years later. But this is not the case. Although literature is based on truth, beauty, and goodness, people's concepts of truth, beauty, and goodness change with the social environment. For example, in the past, a man's long braid was considered beautiful, but now when people see a man from Jiangbei dragging a small braid, they feel sick. In the past, men and women did not touch each other, which was considered a good virtue, but now everyone thinks it is unbearably pedantic. Such changes also apply to literature, etc. He spoke very insightfully. It is heard that the economics group will host next week, and the speaker will be Hu Yuzhi.</p>
<h3>Siam Increases Import Tariffs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter yesterday from the Siamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, which stated: "Respectfully, we have received a letter from the Siamese Director-General of Customs stating that since the implementation of increased tariffs by the Director-General, some merchants and civilians have frequently inquired about whether certain goods should be subject to increased tariffs and to what extent, as the newly promulgated tariff regulations do not clearly state this.

Therefore, the new constitution has adopted the section on human rights protection, which stipulates that the detention of people shall not exceed 24 hours. However, the system for remedies and compensation for unlawful detention has not been adopted. As the people's assembly was about to close and he was about to return to Shanghai, he received a telegram from the association regarding the recovery of the Mixed Court in the Shanghai French Concession. Therefore, he contacted the National Government and the Yuan departments to petition. The result was that both parties were willing to accept and promised to make efforts to recover the Mixed Court in the French Concession. (3) A letter from Judge Gong of the Mixed Court in the French Concession, regarding the association's telegram making certain declarations, was resolved as follows: The association's telegram attacked the poor system of the Mixed Court in the French Concession, and the attacks are based on facts. The executive and supervisory committees reaffirmed this and held all committee members responsible. A letter was sent in reply for reference. (4) Committee Member Li Shirui reported that the draft of the letter to the municipal government requesting the revocation of the municipal public security bureau's notice banning rent arrears had been completed and requested discussion.

<h3>Electric Workers' Wage Conditions to be Mediated Again</h3>
<p>The Chinese Electrical Workers have made demands to revise their wage conditions. After repeated summons by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to convene mediation committee meetings, a complete resolution has yet to be reached.

In the event that both parties persist and mediation cannot proceed, arbitration will inevitably be proposed.</p>
<h3>Bookbinding Workers Strike Again Yesterday Due to Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>The Union Exerted Efforts to Persuade</p>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs Will Mediate Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to the Daily News, the city's bookbinding workers went on strike earlier due to wage increases and revisions to their wage conditions. After persuasion by the union and instructions from the Bureau of Social Affairs, they first resumed work and gave the employers ten days to respond and fulfill the conditions. They had all resumed work, as reported previously. Yesterday, the Zhabei bookbinding workers, as it was Sunday, rested as usual and participated in the Jing'an Temple Bathing Buddha Festival according to old customs. Unexpectedly, someone spread rumors, causing all the workers to misunderstand that the foreign bookbinding businesses of Tangpinji, Mahongji, Xuxiangji, Mao Haoji, Hudong Yangshenji, Chengnai Puxieji, Huxi Louchengji, etc., more than 120 companies, and more than 1,600 workers, gathered yesterday morning in the Xiangshan Road and Zhongxing Road areas, and spontaneously went on strike. Upon hearing the news, the Fifth District Public Security Bureau dispatched several policemen to protect public order. In the morning of yesterday, at the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Xiangshan Road, they arrested eleven people from the Deda Bookbinding Workshop in Zhiyuan Road, Sun Shunhai, Sun Rusong, Tang Shengqing, Li Kunsen, Mao Guangji, Xu Fuqing from the Hexing Bookbinding Workshop, Xu Tangsheng from the Mahongji Bookbinding Workshop, Zhao from the Gonghe Bookbinding Workshop, Bu Xiaoquan, Lu Rongbao, and Liu Changshun from the Xuxiangji Bookbinding Workshop, and temporarily detained them at the Fifth District Public Security Bureau Headquarters. The union learned of the details and immediately issued an emergency notice. At 4 p.m. that afternoon, an urgent meeting of group leaders was held inside the Sixth District Party Headquarters at No. 10 Sandeli, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. More than 200 workers from various work groups attended. Wang Wenhua from the Publishing Industry Union was also invited to assist in persuasion. Chen Zhaoqing was elected as chairman, and reported on the progress of mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs. Then, Wang Wenhua attended the meeting and persuaded the workers, saying, "Comrades, do not take illegal actions. The negotiations for revising the conditions and increasing wages have been earnestly handled by the union and can achieve the goal of victory. If you do not obey the union's orders, you will be violating the instructions of the Bureau of Social Affairs and will be severely restrained by party and government organs. I hope that everyone present will inform the workers in each workshop to understand." After this persuasion, the misunderstanding of the workers was immediately dispelled, and the atmosphere suddenly eased. The meeting adjourned at 6 p.m. It was also learned that the union received a notice from the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday afternoon, which stated, "This Bureau has scheduled a meeting of the mediation committee at 9 a.m. on May 26 to address the union's request to revise the conditions. You are hereby notified to designate two responsible representatives to attend the Bureau and await mediation."</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Temporary Meeting of the Rice Merchants' Guild</h3>
<p>Discussing the Matter of Store Clerks Beaten by Chinese Police</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchants' Guild received a letter yesterday from Xie Fengren Rice Shop, a member of the guild, stating: "Our shop originally operated at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road and moved to the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road in February of this year. Therefore, we leased the original rooftop to Du Shengchang. At 4 p.m. on the 19th of this month, Du Shengchang suddenly brought an electricity bill to the shop, saying that there was an error in the calculation of electricity fees during the rooftop rental and wanted our accountant, Yang Zishan, to go with him to check. Yang said that it was too late, the company had already closed for the day, and it was the time to close the shop, so he was very busy. If he needed to check the account, he could go with him tomorrow. Du insisted and refused, insisting that he had to go with him immediately, and spoke rudely, knocking on the counter with his cane. After our colleagues persuaded him, he stopped. Unexpectedly, a little later, Du used Chinese Police No. 1666 to come to our shop and wanted to arrest Yang to the police station. Yang said that the matter concerned the calculation of electricity fees, which was a civil dispute and had nothing to do with the police station. The Chinese Police officer pointed at Yang and said that he was disobeying orders, dragged Yang out of the store, and at the same time, our colleague Zhang Gengsheng came out to dissuade him, but it was ineffective. Instead, he was beaten with a wooden stick. At that time, Chinese Police No. 1714 and No. 1817, who were patrolling the street, came to help the perpetrator, and the two, Yang and Zhang, were arrested and taken to the police station. They were severely injured along the way. Renji Hospital's injury report proves this. The Chinese Police officer knew that there was no crime to be added, so he falsely accused Yang and Zhang of obstructing official business to vent his anger. The duty of the police station personnel is to protect merchants and civilians, but the Chinese Police officers dared to arbitrarily insult merchants and civilians. It is really a violation of the law. Please seriously negotiate with the police station and punish the violent Chinese Police officers to warn others." Upon receiving the letter, the guild immediately convened an emergency meeting yesterday. More than ten members of the executive committee attended. The chairman read the letter, and all the executive committee members believed that the Chinese Police were relying on their power to destroy merchants and civilians, interfering in minor civil disputes, and beating shop clerks. It was extremely violent. It was unanimously decided to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession to uphold justice, and to seriously negotiate with the Police Department of the Municipal Council to severely punish the violent Chinese Police officers in order to stabilize commerce and the people's lives. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations to Meet Today Regarding the Gu Jingen Case</h3>
<p>Organizing a Support Association for the Tragedy</p>
<p>Gu Jingen, a carpenter from the Taichang Construction Company in this city, was shot and killed by an American sailor, Jeffers, on April 22. The news shocked all circles, and they were deeply indignant. Declarations were issued one after another, expressing unanimous support. It is now learned that the American side has no sincerity in resolving the case. In order to urgently raise funds for countermeasures and relief, a meeting was specifically convened at the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union at 2 p.m. today to organize a support association for the tragedy, specifically to handle the case. The situation is quite serious.</p>
<h3>Recommendation to Recover Haig Road</h3>
<p>Mao Jingxue, Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The Seventeenth Branch of the Second District of Fudan Middle School in Xujiahui sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, stating: "The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Haig Road connects Xujiahui in the south to Jing'an Temple in the north, located in the west of the Public Concession and the French Concession, is a road at the junction of the Chinese concession, is one of the roads built across the boundary, paving the road surface, erecting poles, and operating buses, and has been under the control of the British Municipal Council. Recently, because the branches in various districts of Huxi have repeatedly proposed to recover the roads built across the boundary, the Municipal Council pretends to be deaf and dumb, and allows the road body to be damaged and eroded without repair, causing the Jingxu section of the bus to be suspended, which makes the public feel the inconvenience of transportation. Using the psychology of the masses to penetrate its ambition to expand the roads built across the boundary, at this critical moment of wanting to catch and letting go, the higher-level party committee should be requested to send a letter to the municipal government to recover the road immediately, repair the road body by itself, and release the bus to travel between Xujiahui and Jing'an Temple to facilitate transportation and protect national rights. Moreover, the abolition of unequal treaties has been declared to the outside world by the National Assembly, and the implementation of this declaration, the recovery of the concession, is the greatest goal. Even if the concession cannot be recovered immediately, it is not possible to immediately recover Haig Road, which the imperialists are willing to abandon, and what about the declaration? This branch witnessed the situation and was uneasy and silent. It is used to put forward the conference, and the public unanimously agreed and unanimously passed, and hoped that the party committees at all levels will make the same proposition, promote the realization of the recovery, establish the trend of today, and promote the national glory in the future." Mao Jingxue, Standing Committee Member of the Seventeenth Branch of the Second District, respectfully.</p>

<h3>The Truth About the American Soldier Pushing the Laborer into the River</h3>
<p>The Laborer's Body Was Recovered Yesterday</p>
<p>Waiting for the Report Today to Verify and Seize</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, two sailors from an American warship moored on the Xinkai River hired a rickshaw to the Jinliyuan Wharf No. 8 Warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau on the Huangpu Beach in the French Concession. They got out of the car and walked to the embankment bridge at No. 11, where they wrestled with each other and gradually fell into the river. A nearby worker ran to Limadu and asked for Police No. 165 to come and dissuade them. The sailors refused to beat them. The police officer saw that the language was incomprehensible and could not be reasoned with, so he retreated. At that time, one of the sailors had fallen to the riverbank. Worker A saw that the sailor was in danger and went down to the bridge to rescue him. Unexpectedly, the other sailor pushed A into the river. When the tide was high and the water was strong, A was immediately submerged. The police officer saw that the two sailors had caused a major disaster and took them into the police station. They then ordered the dock workers to salvage the body, but there was no trace of it. Only shoes and hats were recovered. The details have been reported yesterday. It is now learned that the worker's body was found floating on the river surface at the original location of the drowning at 11 a.m. yesterday. The dock workers informed the police, who sent people to salvage the body and ordered detectives to transport it to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. The detectives identified the deceased as Dai Tingzuo, a native of Jiangbei, 23 years old, who lived in Tanziwan, Zhabei, and made a small business on the wharf. His father, Dai Yongxiang, 45 years old, makes a living by pushing a cart. The body has been identified by the family and is waiting for a report today to verify and seize it. The translated name of the sailor who caused the disaster is Shi Jili Pei'er, Brandel.</p>
<h3>The Second Practice Hall Holds a Release Ceremony</h3>

Director Gong investigated and verified the facts and approved the release of a portion of the people. The release ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. today. Agencies such as the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, charities, and the Hall's directors have sent representatives to participate in the speech, so that the vagrants will be more diligent after leaving the Hall and become law-abiding citizens again.</p>
<h3>Stop Issuing Passports to Laborers Going to France</h3>
<p>To Avoid Being Stranded in Foreign Countries</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from the Embassy in France, stating that merchants from Zhejiang who go to countries such as Portugal and Belgium must pass through France. However, these merchants all stay in France after arriving in France, which is a serious street scene, and some of them are stranded in France due to the exhaustion of funds, which is related to international face. Please order the passport-issuing agencies to stop issuing passports to merchants who come to France and pass through France, so as to avoid being stranded in foreign countries. After approving the telegram, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent separate consultation letters to the municipal and county governments, ordering the Public Security Bureau to comply. It is also heard that the French Consul General's Office in Shanghai has also received instructions from its government to stop countersigning passports for Chinese merchants coming to France and passing through France. Therefore, those who have held passports and went to request countersignature on this day have been rejected.</p>

<h3>Good News for the Construction Industry</h3>
<p>Yellow Sand Landowners Transport and Sell Their Own Sand</p>
<p>Excellent Quality, Low Price, and Ample Stock</p>
<p>Yellow sand is an essential material for construction. Due to different properties, it is divided into sea sand and lake sand. Sea sand is pure and free of mud, making it especially popular in the construction industry. It is produced in various counties of Ningbo. It is now reported that the landowners of various sand fields have jointly organized the Yitai Sand and Stone Company, hiring their own ships to transport yellow sand to Shanghai for construction purposes. The pricing is low, and storage is available at any time to meet demand. Shanghai has a large demand for sand, and there will be no shortage in the future. This is also good news for the construction era. However, Shanghai brokers are confusing ship owners and builders in various ways, hoping to disrupt business. Yesterday, a key figure of the company mentioned this matter, saying that the company gives ship owners preferential treatment on freight, calculating values by the ton, unlike in the past where more was counted as less. Currently, ships loading sand from the outer seas to Shanghai are actively transporting. As for the construction industry, because the sand is of excellent quality and low price, and there is a large inventory that can be supplied at any time, there is no fear of shortage, which can avoid the loss of work stoppage due to lack of sand. I think everyone will agree with this. In this situation, ship owners and builders can directly contact the company at No. 88, North Side of Zhonghong Bridge.</p>

<p>Ji Yulong from Yangzhou, previously forged the birth date of Li Dafenzi, a 19-year-old female worker from the same hometown at a certain yarn factory, claiming that the woman was his fiancée. He gathered hooligans and robbed the woman near Wende Lane on Linqing Road, taking her to the home of Wang Zhang, a Jiangbei woman at No. 392 Haizhou Road, and threatened her to marry him. Fortunately, the woman's younger sister, Xiaofenzi, quickly rescued her, preserving her virginity. Ji and Wang Zhang were detained by the police and sent to the Special District Local Court for trial, as previously reported. In recent days, Chinese and foreign detectives have been rigorously pursuing the hooligans who helped rob the woman, but they have all fled and disappeared. The day before yesterday, it was time for the continued hearing. The police brought witnesses and escorted Ji to the court. Dafenzi clearly stated that her parents had never arranged any marriage with the defendant when she was young, and that the defendant was taking advantage of her being orphaned and weak to commit this illegal act. When questioned, Ji still claimed that he and the woman were cousins ​​and had a marriage agreement. Wang Zhang kept evading.

<h3>Prosperous Record of the Bathing Buddha Ceremony</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth day of the fourth month of the abandoned lunar calendar. The Jing'an Temple in western Shanghai held the Bathing Buddha Ceremony as usual. The sidewalks along Haig Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Daxilu, and Yuyuan Road near the temple were almost entirely lined with various stalls. The stall vendors had been worried about business losses due to the continuous rainy days, and yesterday morning, there was still light rain. Unexpectedly, at 1 pm, the sky suddenly cleared up. As a result, men and women, young and old, flocked to the temple like swarms of bees, and the roads were crowded with people. For a moment, the vendors' business was booming, and they were overwhelmed. Incense smoke filled the temple, dazzling the eyes. The lights and colors were brilliant, and the drums and music were played in unison. The crowding was even greater than in previous years. The police station in charge specially dispatched Chinese police detectives to strictly investigate and suppress the crowd. There were also security corps and boy scouts taking care of the temple. The Public Concession Tram Company temporarily added several trams on routes one and two, and the bus company also added several buses on routes nine and one. Every tram and bus was filled with passengers. Because of the traffic jam, Route 9 buses had to turn around at the end of Fuxu Road. This was also the result of good weather, creating a moment of great prosperity.</p>
<h3>Sailing Ship Crosses East to Japan</h3>
<p>An Adventure Undertaken as a Game</p>
<p>Revealing a Glimpse of the Western Character</p>
<p>Last Saturday afternoon (23rd), the sailing ships "Crichton" and "Nidaros" sailed down the Huangpu River, embarking on the pioneering feat of crossing the ocean and braving the dangers to Japan. The waves were surging, and the weather was bad, but they did not care. The Nidaros hoisted the flag of all nations, and the Crichton hoisted the German flag. Most of the sailors were British. The two sailboats weighed 25 tons, and most of the people on board were members of the Shanghai Sailing Club. On board the Nidaros was the shipowner, Mr. Erickson, who was also the chief pilot of China Aviation Corporation, Mr. Neal, an employee of the Public Works Department's Finance Office, Mr. Milligan, an employee of the Lao Gongmao Foreign Company, and Mr. Blacker, who worked for the Shanghai Tram Company. In addition, there was the Chinese helmsman of Mr. Neal's sailing ship Viking. The Crichton carried Mr. Austed of Nanyang Foreign Company, Mr. Blanc of British American Tobacco, Mr. Du Hua of Jiangnan Shipyard, and Mr. Klehen of Tongjilong. The two helmsmen were hired by Mr. Austed. At first, the Chinese and Westerners on the two ships all signed contracts acknowledging themselves as sailors, with a daily wage of one cent in US dollars. The adventurers were all good at sailing, and the two sailing ships had recently sailed to Ma'anshan Island outside the port. Although the weather was unusually bad one day, all the sailors returned with great interest, which led to the motive of sailing to Nagasaki. This time, a retired US Navy officer was originally scheduled to be in charge of navigation for the adventure across the East, but this did not happen. Instead, Mr. Erickson and Mr. Blanc jointly took charge of the navigation of the two boats. Mr. Ai was originally a flight navigator, and Mr. Bai used to be a retired officer of the British Navy. The two ships sailed separately, and if they met in the middle of the voyage, they would give each other a pleasant greeting. The estimated round trip voyage is ten to twelve days. If they encounter a southwest wind, they can reach Nagasaki in three and a half days. However, in reality, it is expected that it will take four days to reach. They will rest in Nagasaki for two or three days, and then return. The straight-line distance from Shanghai to Nagasaki is 467 miles. This is the first time to venture to sail in a sailing ship. When the two ships departed, they were all excited and happy, almost as if they were sailing downstream in the Huangpu River on the weekend. Another sailing ship, Ira, loaded with Chinese helmsmen, set off firecrackers to wish them success and sent them to Songkou before returning.</p>
<h3>Kidnapper Leader Shuai Zhongping to be Transferred for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Thousand Yuan Check as Reward</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in a Week</p>
<p>Shuai Zhongping, from Jiangxi, once a military commander, became a kidnapping ringleader in Shanghai after leaving the army. Following the kidnapping of Lu Shaotang last winter, the Public Concession police authorities offered a hefty reward of one thousand taels of gold, intensifying the search. Shuai initially avoided Shanghai and fled north to Tianjin and Beijing, using the alias Cai Ming. On the first of this month, he was arrested by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team in Chuanban Hutong, Chongwenmen. Also arrested was Wu Ruichen, from Henan, who had previously served as a commander under Feng Yuxiang. As the Tianjin authorities believed the two were responsible for several major cases in Tianjin, they were transferred from Beijing for interrogation in Tianjin. The Commissioner of the Public Works Department believes Shuai is the mastermind behind the kidnapping case and that he may be involved in other major kidnapping cases. He should be transferred to Shanghai and severely punished according to the law. A bank check for one thousand yuan was prepared, and Chinese and foreign detectives Liu Shaokui and Henry Todd were dispatched on a steamboat to Tianjin the day before yesterday to apply to the local authorities for extradition. The check is a reward for those who solved the case. If Tianjin does not object, it is expected that this major criminal will be brought to Shanghai for trial in about a week.</p>
<h3>Pirates Rampant on the Sea off the North Mouth of Haizhou</h3>
<p>Two Ship Crews Killed</p>
<p>One Shipowner Kidnapped</p>
<p>The Shandong sand barge "Yang Yutai" was sailing to Dalian with goods such as native cloth from "Kui Shun Heng" and other companies. On the 20th of this month, it sailed on the sea off the north mouth of Haizhou. Due to unfavorable winds, it anchored near the coast. Unexpectedly, the next morning, as it was about to weigh anchor and set sail, two pirate ships suddenly approached. Dozens of pirates swarmed aboard, threatening with guns, and forced the twenty or so crew members to the front of the ship to be monitored. The pirates searched everywhere, and finding no silver dollars, they searched the crew members at the front of the ship, stealing all the silver dollars. They then asked who the shipowner was, but the crew members did not answer. The pirates opened fire on the crew, killing two people. Seeing this, the crew members were terrified and had to point out the shipowner. The pirates dragged the shipowner out, demanding silver dollars, but when he refused, they kidnapped him onto the pirate ship. At the same time, they opened the hold and stole cloth, about half a hold's worth. At that moment, a steamer was about to pass by, and its whistle blew. Hearing the sound, the pirates stopped looting, jumped onto the pirate ships in a hurry, and told the crew as they left to prepare five thousand yuan quickly to redeem the shipowner. The two pirate ships sailed eastward on the sea. The "Yang" ship has now sailed to Shanghai and is anchored in the Huangpu River. Yesterday, the ship's accountant, Mr. Shan, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing to report to the cargo owner and request assistance in rescuing the shipowner. Merchants are now petitioning the relevant water police to suppress the pirates severely to ensure the safety of shipping.</p>
<h3>Yun Fujun Sues for Divorce</h3>
<p>His Wife Sued for Debt</p>
<p>Ran Away from Home, Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>Mediation Failed</p>
<p>Lawyer Yun Fujun, styled Hengshu, was the magistrate of Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, in the past. After he lost his wife, Cha Renwei, a prominent local gentleman and a close friend of Yun, took it upon himself to find a new wife for him, so he married Ms. Zhou Chunting to Yun. Later, Yun left his official career and settled in Shanghai, practicing law. Coincidentally, after Cha Renwei resigned from his position as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, he also moved his family to Shanghai and became a lawyer. Yun and Cha were old friends and now colleagues, so their friendship deepened, and their families visited each other frequently. However, last year, Cha's wife, Ms. Han Jingnong, sued Yun's wife, Ms. Zhou Chunting, through her husband, lawyer Cha Renwei, in the Special District Court for failing to repay a debt of several thousand yuan. After being sued, Ms. Zhou did not inform her husband but ran away alone, whereabouts unknown. Lawyer Yun then represented his wife in court. The initial trial resulted in an order for Ms. Zhou to repay the debt. However, Ms. Han was still dissatisfied and appealed through lawyer Cha, demanding that Yun Fujun be jointly liable for the repayment. At that time, the two sides had attempted to reach a settlement out of court. Yun was willing to repay the debt on behalf of his wife, but he absolutely refused to have his name listed on the official documents. Therefore, the settlement failed. The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court held a hearing and ordered Ms. Han to provide evidence. Han then claimed that she had borrowed the money from a third party and had repaid it on behalf of Zhou when she failed to meet the deadline. However, Han kept the name of the third party a secret. The appellate court found that the appellant's request to hold Yun jointly liable for the debt was insufficient and dismissed the appeal. This happened in the spring of this year. Ms. Zhou never appeared in court throughout the case. Initially, Yun did not know her whereabouts. Recently, Yun Fujun hired a lawyer to sue Zhou Chunting for divorce, requesting the Special Court to mediate the case first. The other day, Judge Zhou Daren held a special mediation hearing, but after much persuasion, it was difficult to reach a peaceful resolution due to the deep divisions between the two parties. They were ordered to leave. Yun has now formally filed a lawsuit to terminate the marriage. The cause of this case is purely the debt dispute mentioned above. It is said that Ms. Zhou is thirty-three years old and has served in the education sector, a remarkable woman.</p>

<p>Correspondence</p>
<h3>Xu Peihuang's Speech on the Training of Industrial and Commercial Management Talents</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, delivered a speech at the China General Chamber of Commerce on "The Training of Industrial and Commercial Management Personnel." His speech is as follows: "I am honored to be invited here today to give a speech on 'The Training of Industrial and Commercial Management Personnel.' I am very ashamed. Listening to the chairman's introduction just now, I realize that everyone present is an industrial and commercial expert and leader in various fields, so I feel even more ashamed to be displaying my limited skills before experts. Although this speech was scheduled long ago, I have had too many trivial affairs to attend to and have not prepared anything. I will just speak extemporaneously and offer some suggestions. Please feel free to correct me. When we talk about the training of industrial and commercial management personnel, we must first understand its meaning. What is now called scientific management is to achieve the greatest effect with the most economical time, the best method, and the least amount of money. In foreign industrial and commercial management, it can be divided into two parts: (1) machinery; (2) personnel. Having good machinery is naturally of great help to us, but it is not always the case. For example, if a large amount of money is spent to buy a very new and sophisticated machine, but it is not used properly or is misused, the machine's effectiveness cannot be seen. Because the machine is inanimate and needs people to use it, if the person using it (i.e., the manager) does not have the right method and lacks the necessary knowledge and experience, it is also useless. Even if the machine has great capabilities, it cannot be demonstrated. Therefore, the problem of personnel is considered very important in foreign countries. China is a country with backward production, and industry is still in its infancy. The word 'machine' is still out of reach, so the problem of personnel is even more important, needless to say. In 1915, when the European War began, the British government commissioned J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. to be its commercial representative to build thousands of pounds of British goods in the United States in a short period. Morgan then found Mr. Stan Tennis, the general manager of the famous Diamond Match Company in the United States, to handle this matter. Mr. Si knew that the American goods standard was not suitable for the needs of British government orders and that American factories had to be changed first. However, the difficulty was trusting which large factory to change its internal work to undertake this large order without any problems. Mr. Si then decided that the first prerequisite was the factory's leader's ability to do this, regardless of factory size, capital, or machinery. If we analyze it in percentage, he decided that the personnel issue should account for 97.5%, while the machinery issue only accounted for 2.5%. The results later proved that his decision was correct. Now, American business leaders, such as the oil magnate and the steel magnate, also acknowledge that such a distribution is correct. It can be seen that personnel are the most important. What is the method of personnel training? It can also be represented by a metaphor. I once saw a book that used a shovel to illustrate scientific management. The shovel seems to be a very ordinary object, but the shovel factory has a standard, that is, the size of the shovel is never casually determined. They have experimented from many people's point of view to find a suitable load weight of 21 pounds, and then study the length of the handle and the size of the shovel. Which one should be used to shovel loose material, which should be larger, and which should be used to shovel hard material, which should be smaller. How to use it and what posture to take. They all have a very detailed study. On this small issue, the factory is always thinking of ways to improve it, how to improve efficiency. With a shovel and workers, without management, you can't get good results. Therefore, how meticulous should the management of workers be, how should the organization be planned, how much should the factory ship, what should the sales plan be, and the internal budget and final accounts all have a good design, with clear lines, with precise steps to implement, and not blindly like a blind man riding a blind horse and deciding where to go. They focus on using fewer people, spending less money, and saving money, and all aspects are economical. This is the element of management. From the above, industrial and commercial management talents must have thinking, ambition, perseverance, and the ability to organize. Now the commercial war is fierce and changes infinitely. Many people are used to manage, and they must be properly trained. I remember when I was in the United States, I saw their facilities for hiring employees in a department store, which is worth emulating. For example, when someone goes to apply, the first thing they do is go through an employee supervisor's questioning office, where they ask about detailed experience, skills, expertise, and expected compensation, etc. After being selected, the second step is to open a training class in the company for a few days or one or two weeks to instill all the content, procedures, etc., and various skills needed by the company, so that the newcomers can fully understand it before it is over. From this point of view, the situation in each industry is different, and there should be specialized training, but today the time is very short, and I cannot talk more about the various professions. I will just offer some opinions on the general outline. Regarding the training of management talents, there are a few points that should be paid attention to: First, "thinking," but senior staff are slightly different from middle-level staff, and middle-level staff are different from low-level staff. Senior and middle-level staff should all have a sensitive mind, and always use methods to plan and promote business. The use of brain power is originally considered very common by scientists, and it is the same in industrial and commercial management. Otherwise, if you only know how to be conservative, you will never be able to compete in this ever-changing era. Second, "sound body," we must have a sound body to serve, otherwise, if the body is poor, we will not be able to raise our spirits and the things will not be done well. Third, "sense of responsibility" The company entrusted the affairs to the shoulders of the various staff members, and if one day they do not do it, they will be suspended, which will have a great impact. It is even more impossible to muddle through and just let it go. The Chinese people's common problem has always been unwilling to take responsibility, and they have pushed the responsibility out, pushed it on someone else, and that's it. So everyone is unwilling to take responsibility, and they push each other, and as a result, often very good things are left unfinished. This is the biggest drawback. Fourth, "automatic ability." I hope that everyone will not regard themselves as passive mechanical positions, and should have automatic ability. If you have unique insights and good ideas, you can contribute them. The wise senior staff should also accept reasonable suggestions and implement them in order. In this way, everyone's efforts will surely have a broad effect. Fifth, "understand the responsibilities," that is, the responsibilities that one should fulfill. Sixth, "loyalty" (that is, commercial morality) (1) Loyalty to the company or factory, (2) Loyalty to the cause. Seventh, "obedience," should be as disciplined as in the military. The above seven items seem simple, but in the training of senior staff, it seems indispensable. As for the low-level staff (including foremen to workers), there are also three key points: (1) "cooperation." For example, if a colleague is doing a certain job, other partners should always and everywhere help each other in good faith. Otherwise, if they do not conspire with each other, if Qin people view Yue, it will be irrelevant, and the public will be greatly affected. (2) "Courtesy." Although workers in foreign countries do not enjoy much education, their words and deeds are inevitably rude, but they know how to be polite when they meet middle and senior staff. This point may still be lacking in our country. (3) "Punctuality." For example, in a factory, there are 1,000 workers, and each person is late for five minutes every day. It seems very subtle, but when 1,000 people are calculated, there are 83 hours of work cessation every day. If we calculate it by 300 days a year, we get 29,880 hours, which is equivalent to 1,245 days of loss (that is, less than three years). In this number, how much is the factory's loss in wages, and how much is the loss in machinery and materials? It is very alarming. Everyone here has different professions and different circumstances, but in terms of training, we should all pay special attention to the above points. Originally, in Europe and the United States, for the general public, it is enough to train the above points a little bit. This is not to say that foreigners are always better than us, because they already have a considerable understanding and considerable training in primary and secondary schools, so a little training will have an effect. Our people usually lack proper education. I think that the fundamental solution is to ask primary and secondary schools across the country to add a practical vocational cultivation subject, and pay attention to morality and responsibility, as a ladder for him to serve the world and society in the future. And the current palliative, it seems, should establish a training institute for industrial and commercial management talents to supplement the shortcomings of schools and create new-style talents, so that there is hope. Moreover, the national system has been established, and construction has begun. In the future, there will be a great need for talents. For example, to establish various large state-owned or private enterprises, there is no capital. Premier said that foreign capital can be used. Machinery and engineers are temporarily lacking, and it is not advisable to temporarily borrow foreign power. However, we cannot borrow all the staff who manage the workers and the workers who are directly engaged in production. Otherwise, will the huge amount of money be thrown into the void? Now, in addition to the above three points that should be paid attention to in the training of junior staff, there is also a reward method that cannot be ignored. Like the United States, no matter what kind of personnel, one person's industry has a great hope, in addition to bonuses or dividends, the only reward is that a small foreman can gradually be promoted to general manager or factory director, so they can all enjoy their work, be willing to work hard, and be loyal to their duties. In our country, it is not the case that the powerful are either large shareholders or people who have a close relationship with the company. Ordinary employees have no hope of being promoted, so the distance is very far. Although in the current social environment, or can not emulate foreigners, but I very much hope that society will progress day by day, and should also try this reward system. Today, I have talked a lot, and there may be some missteps, please forgive and advise you all."</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: I have read an item in the Party Department meeting on the 22nd of this month. Judging from what is recorded, it is completely inconsistent with the facts. On the 18th of this month, our association received a notice from the Eighth District Party Department to discuss follow-up measures, and immediately sent Wu Longhai and Ye Pengyuan to go. However, more than two hours after they left, the other party did not send anyone to attend, and only talked briefly with the person in charge of the District Party Department before announcing their withdrawal. Furthermore, the Wusong Sand and Mud Management Bureau's detention of sailors sparked a wave of protests. Our association repeatedly stated that it stood in a mediating position because the sailors were not members. However, everything said by Xu Yifei, the representative of the Dachang and Yitai companies, in the report is completely inconsistent with the facts. In addition to writing to the Eighth District Party Department to request correction, we are writing to your newspaper to request immediate correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Sand and Stone Industry Association, 20.5.23. To Whom It May Concern: I have just read a news item in your newspaper about the abolition of the Inland River Steamship Business Office, which is quite inconsistent with the facts. The following is a brief description of the handling process so that all sectors of society can understand the truth. In June last year, the Bureau leased all the ships, docks, warehouses, assets, and other buildings of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Inland River Steamship Bureau, and set up an office to operate the business. After only seven months of operation, the losses had reached more than 10,000 yuan, and the internal chaos was indescribable. The future of shipping was even harder to revitalize. Until the province strictly implemented the austerity policy, reduced expenditures, and appointed another member to take over, in order to effectively rectify it. For several months, the results have been quite remarkable. However, due to the long-standing malpractices, it has become a serious problem, and no matter how strictly we eliminate them, there is no hope of thorough clarification. Moreover, most of the ships have been in disrepair for a long time and are in a state of disrepair, and a large amount of funds is urgently needed to repair them. At this time, the provincial treasury is insufficient to inject funds. In order to promote private industry and avoid wasting public funds, our office submitted a proposal to the provincial government for deliberation and decision to contract all routes to merchants, and the ships are also repaired by merchants. Tenders are currently being advertised, and the routes have not been completely contracted. As for the establishment of an Inland River Navigation Management Office in Shanghai to manage the collection of rent, there is no such thing. Correspondingly, the process is described in order to request that you check and correct it. To Shen Bao, Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, May 22.</p>

<h3>Financial Market Last Week: Drastic Changes in the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Silver Prices and Drafts Both Contract... Plus Short Positions Being Covered</p>
<p>Highest at 796 Taels... A Weekly Increase of 46.5 Taels</p>
<p>Last week, the price of gold continued to reach new peaks daily, almost reaching its zenith. It once broke through the 790 tael mark, only 3 taels short of the highest red market price this spring, which was 790 taels. Daily fluctuations exceeded 10 taels. The reason for this rapid increase was primarily due to the frequent contraction of the silver market and Hong Kong drafts, coupled with the urgent covering of short positions by fellow traders, which stirred up emotions. However, such a surge after the rollover was unexpected. Starting from the beginning of the week (the 18th), the Large Bar contracted by 0.0625, and the silver price did not change, so the initial exchange rate was also flat. However, internal pressure tightened, and speculators were excited. As soon as the July gold price opened, it increased by 1.5 taels, reaching 49.5 taels, and immediately broke through 50 taels. There was also news that Mexico was considering switching to gold coins and selling silver. This further boosted confidence. By the afternoon, it had already exceeded 60 taels. Major players like Da Xing Yong competed to buy, so the market closed at 62 taels, a sharp increase of 14 taels compared to the previous Saturday, with a difference of 13.5 taels throughout. The next day, the Large Bar further decreased by 0.125, the silver price was 3.75, and the initial exchange rate contracted by one level. The internal market also tightened. When the gold price opened at 65.5 taels, there were fluctuations of 4-5 taels due to varying buying and selling. After 11 o'clock, Yongheng and others covered their short positions, especially as the Dalian draft was quoted one cent higher, suddenly pushing through 70 taels. In the afternoon, it reached 74 taels, closing at 73.5 taels, a further increase of 11.5 taels. However, Hengxing sold 2,000 units of long positions. The Large Bar fell again by 0.3125 to 3.75, while the exchange rate repeatedly contracted twice, totaling one level. The internal market also remained strong. However, the gold price opened down by 2 taels at 71.5 taels, mainly because the Large Bar was unstable and sentiment was weak, and there were still many sellers. Subsequently, it fell to 68 taels and 2 cents. Afterwards, Yongheng and others covered their short positions, and the foreign exchange market also tightened. The exchange rate was adjusted downwards, and by noon, it had reached 81 taels. In the afternoon, it reached 81 taels and 1 cent, closing at 76 taels and 8 cents, due to the activity of sellers, a further increase of 3 taels and 3 cents compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of 12 taels and 4 cents throughout the day. The next day, the Large Bar rebounded by 0.0625, and the silver price was adjusted to 73 taels and 8 cents, with a fluctuation of over 11 taels from 71.5 taels to 82.5 taels. At noon, it returned to 71 taels, due to conflicting news in the silver market. Initially, there were rumors that the United States was selling silver, but it was actually a mistake about buying. In the afternoon, there were many buyers, reaching 79 taels and 2 cents, closing at 76 taels and 9 cents, only an increase of 1 cent compared to the previous day. Speculator Mr. Wu entered and exited the market frequently. On Friday, the Large Bar increased again by 0.1875, the silver market and exchange rate did not change, and the internal market was also flat. The gold price opened at 75 taels and 8 cents, down 1 tael and 1 cent, then rose from 78 taels to 71 taels at noon. In the afternoon, it closed at 75 taels and 7 cents, a slight decrease of 1 tael and 2 cents compared to the previous day, reversing the four-day consecutive rise. On Saturday, the Large Bar contracted again by 0.1875, American silver by 0.0375, and the exchange rate contracted by one level. The internal market trend was particularly tight, and traders continued to speculate. The gold market opened with a sharp increase of 10 taels and 8 cents, reaching 86.5 taels. Afterwards, it soared rapidly, with the price difference not exceeding 2-3 taels, mainly due to the extremely tight foreign exchange market and strong buying interest, breaking through 90 taels. By noon, it had reached 96 taels. Finally, the situation eased, closing at 94.5 taels, a sharp increase of 18 taels and 8 cents compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 10 taels and 7 cents, almost recreating a new record. The high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as gold prices, are listed below.</p>

<h3>Overseas Silver Market Continues to Decline Sharply</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from London yesterday, the Large Bar silver continued to see a sharp decline, with both recent and forward contracts contracting by 0.3125 to 12 Pence 0.3125. India's position was slightly sold off. Chinese bankers bought in at low prices. The market stabilized after closing. According to a telegram from New York, the American silver price also plummeted by 0.625, with the spot price being 2 Jiao 6 and a half Fen.

The market situation was stagnant, it was said.</p>
<h3>Sunday's Interest Rate Settlement Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and as usual, there were no significant market news from various parties. Trading in the market was particularly quiet. The early market interest rate was 7 Qian 2 Fen 9 Li 1 Hao 2 Hu and a half. The afternoon market was 7 Qian 2 Fen 9 Li 3 Hao 7 Hu and a half. As a result, it was 3 Hao 7 Hu and a half better than the early market on the previous day. The silver interest rate was 3 Fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, which was also 1 Fen better than the previous afternoon. The amount of foreign currency transactions was 335,000 for drafts in the morning market and 240,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 10,000 in the morning market and 30,000 in the afternoon market. Over-the-counter banknotes were 40,000 in the morning market and 20,000 in the afternoon market. Qianzhuang foreign public bills collected and remitted more than 4.1 million, and silver public bills collected and remitted more than 3.1 million. Small Qianzhuang transactions were 400,000 to 500,000. Various Hong Kong bill collections and remittances were 500,000 to 600,000. Banks were closed for business due to the holiday, with no market transactions. The prices of auxiliary currency transactions in the morning market were 6 Qian 5 Fen 5 Li for Jiangnan small foreign coins and 6 Qian 4 Fen 9 Li for Guangdong small foreign coins.

<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Fell Significantly Again Last Week</h3>
<p>Transaction Volume Reached 13.3 Million</p>
<p>During the past week, the public bond market was still extremely active. The total transaction volume for the week was 13,386,000 yuan, an increase of more than 380,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Among them, as the end of the month approached, transactions for the current month were not very active. Transactions for the next month were often several times higher than those for the current month. The spot market was still limited, with only 70,200 yuan opened. Regarding the changes in bond prices, due to the continued rumors about the current situation, people's minds were still unsettled. Selling transactions in the market still dominated, so prices tended to decline. However, due to the approaching end of the month for delivery, major players showed a slight wait-and-see attitude, and the supply and demand situation was also balanced. As a result, there was still a consistent decline compared to the previous week. Among them, the 20 Customs Bond fell by more than 3 yuan, the most significant. The 20 Rolling Bond and the 19 Customs Improved Bond each continued to fall by around 2 yuan. Others also fell slightly, ranging from 4-5 Jiao to more than 1 yuan. The statistics of the high, low, and increase/decrease in bond prices last week are listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: A Glimpse of the Yarn Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Conditions Improved in the Second Half of the Week</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth market was rather at risk of declining last week. The situation was shaky and uncertain, fluctuating up and down due to the impact of the current situation, within a range of two taels. Due to the downward trend in the overseas cotton market and the deteriorating political atmosphere, most sellers shared a pessimistic outlook, and the market sentiment was unusually weak at one point. Moreover, a large amount of 10-count coarse yarn was prepared for delivery this month, which was expected to put pressure on the market. However, due to tight foreign exchange and soaring gold prices, although overseas prices fell, the silver-based calculation was still expensive. Therefore, a major merchant remained calm and prepared to receive goods this month, approximately 13,000-14,000 bales, mostly coarse yarn. The current yarn sales in the market were relatively smooth. The northern region, which had been dominated by Japanese yarn, found it more cost-effective to purchase in Shanghai due to the exchange rate relationship, so business continued uninterrupted. However, the southern region had been quiet for a long time, hindered by the current situation, and most were waiting and seeing. Therefore, if there were no changes in the political situation, the coarse yarn market would have great hope. Although most merchants in the market were bearish, the market was able to withstand the pressure, mainly because the base was too weak and manufacturers had long been in distress, so there was a lack of large-scale selling. According to statistics, various groups purchased 10,750 bales of current yarn, and fellow traders purchased 2,500 bales, maintaining a firm price. Sales of 20-count Japanese yarn were quite brisk. The standard price was weak at the beginning of the week due to the poor atmosphere, but improved significantly by the weekend, with the exchange rate trending downward and rising. The total transaction volume for the week was 154,400 bales, with prices for each month rising by 1 tael 5-6 Qian to 2 taels 1-2 Qian compared to the previous week. Osaka's three-grade yarn fell by 7-8 yuan compared to the previous week. The number of bales purchased by each group is recorded below:</p>
<p>Group Bales Group Bales Miscellaneous 500 Fellow Traders 2,500</p>
<p>Qingdao 660 Hankou 300 Luzhou 190 Guangdong 325</p>

<p>Gaoyang 195 Qinhuangdao 230 Jiangxi 130 Zhenjiang 120</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Ended Beautifully Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market at the beginning of the week saw new lows due to the downward trend of American cotton, breaking the 9-cent mark. For a time, panic rose in the market, and the situation felt quite weak. It was also rumored that there were more than 40,000 dan of deliveries this month, and there was a shortage of receivers. Before long, the exchange rate shrank drastically again, and gold prices soared, causing the atmosphere to suddenly rise. Also, there was talk of yarn factories receiving goods, and Japanese merchants also had the intention of buying. At the same time, it was cheaper to buy spot cotton outside, and the market turned upward. The supply from the Han route was still lacking, and standard cotton prices for each month rose by 4-5 Qian compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the week was 391,600 dan. The source included 1,250 bales of Yao cotton, 250 bales of Tong cotton. Manufacturers purchased 2,000 pieces of Indian cotton, 3,500 bales of fire engine cotton, and 1,000 pieces of Shaanxi cotton. American cotton fell by 40 pounds compared to the previous week. The purchase amounts of each manufacturer are recorded below:</p>
<p>Manufacturer Purchase Highest Price Lowest Price Transaction Volume Deadline</p>
<p>Yao Cotton 37.25 ... 300 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton 37.50 37.00 3,500 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<p>Yao Cotton 35.80 ... 300 bales Spot Warehouse Delivery</p>
<h3>American Cotton Continued to Fall by 25 Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially fell due to favorable weather forecasts, but later softened due to weakness on Wall Street and selling from the South. Futures fell by 23-24 pounds, and spot prices fell by 25 pounds. The American cotton market was closed. Indian cotton speculators sold, and Japanese merchants bought. Pingle fell by 4 Rupees, Oomra and Bai Luoxi fell by 2 Rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 23rd):</p>

<h3>American Cotton Had No Major Changes Last Week</h3>
<p>People in the Industry Are Paying Attention to Securities</p>
<p>A report from New York on the 20th regarding the cotton market during the week stated: The cotton market last week focused on the closing of long positions, with local and Southern selling leading to a decline. This was mainly because the weekend weather report for the cotton-producing region was generally better, and the securities market was still weak. The supply during the price decline was absorbed by industry buying and short covering, mostly due to the reappearance of rainy weather in the South. The current unfavorable weather is not enough to stimulate public buying, so the market situation is unusually uneven. People in the industry are paying close attention to the securities market. The weather situation this month has generally been too wet and cold. According to some experts, about 80% of the cotton fields have been sown. Whether the need for replanting is greater than the average is still a question. According to the general situation of American cotton production, there are several points that are lower than normal, especially in Oklahoma. The weekend statistics are attached on the left:</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Lanchi Silkworm Cocoon Production Less Than One-Third</h3>
<p>Cocoon Merchants' Cocoon Collection Not Prosperous... Cocoon Price Averaging 52-53 Yuan. In various villages of Lanchi, the spring cocoon harvest this year is exceptionally poor. New cocoons have been on the market for a week, and the total cocoon production is only about one-third of a normal year. Only seven or eight cocoon merchants have opened for business. After several days of operation, the number of cocoons arriving on the market is scarce. The quality of the cocoons is mostly inferior, with few of good quality. The highest cocoon price is 54-55 yuan, the lowest is 47-48 yuan, and the average is 52-53 yuan. Fresh dried cocoons will begin to be shipped out within days.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan New Tea Opening for Business</h3>
<p>New tea from various villages in Wuyuan County, after being searched and bought by tea firms, has gradually become more active in opening for business and making deals yesterday (the 15th). This is because tea firms see that the tea this year is tender and inexpensive, and the prices of Tunxi tea are expensive, and most believe it can compete for the year. Mountain households, seeing that credit is extremely tight and fearing that the price of black tea will not be high, and that tea firms will reduce their enthusiasm, are also willing to sell, bearing the pain. Therefore, today, those who are negotiating prices and opening for business are even more lively. New tea from the northeast, southwest, and four other routes are opening for business one after another. Those opening for business in the northern villages include Congshu, priced at 46 yuan, Yang'e Longxi, priced at 49 yuan, and Kengkou Sixi, priced at 45 yuan. In the villages of the 19th Capital, more than ten villages are negotiating prices and will open for business. In the eastern village of Shangmen Yutan, the opening price is 57 yuan, and in the Xitou area, famous tea is priced at 70 yuan. In the western villages of You Ting Yantian, etc., the opening price is 38 yuan to 40 yuan. In the southern villages of Zhongyun Zhangmu Kaoshui, the opening price is around 40 yuan. In the main sources of Qinghua tea, more than a hundred tea merchants are running around negotiating deals. The market is twice as active as before.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt Prices Rise Like Crazy</h3>
<p>Asphalt is a raw material for candles and soap. Last winter, due to an unusually poor harvest in Western Hubei, the production volume was only 20% of that of previous years. Since the beginning of spring, the price has been rising repeatedly, and to this day, it has risen more and more fiercely, like a storm, unstoppable. Last week, the price in Wuhan increased to 26 taels and 2 Qian for Chongqing asphalt and 25 taels for Macheng asphalt. However, in the past two days, telegrams have flown in from Wuhan saying that Macheng oil merchants require 30 taels, and traders intend to open at 29 taels, but merchants have not agreed, so it has not been opened. However, a rise of 4-5 taels is truly unprecedented, a new record since the market began. However, where will such a frantic rise ultimately lead? Even those who have been in the business for a long time cannot predict it. It is heard that the price of Neiping Benche oil in Zhejiang has increased to 49 yuan and 50 yuan per dan. It is because at this time of frantic and chaotic price increases, there is no standard basis for buying and selling, only like being in a storm, letting it go where it may.</p>

<h3>Record of Lady Hu Bridge</h3>
<p>— Jin Hewang</p>
<p>Pengkai Town, east of Kunshan. The Wapu River flows into the Wusong River. There is a gentleman of virtuous conduct, Mr. Hu Shiyu, who leads his hidden partner, Lady Cao, to live frugally and diligently, setting an example for the villagers. Lady Hu never employs a servant, yet manages all household affairs. Even in her old age, she wears worn clothes and eats simple meals. Although the lady is thrifty and frugal, she is always eager to benefit the people. The branch of the Wapu River called Crane Neck Bay is located two miles northwest of Pengkai. Its stone bridge was destroyed during the Xianfeng Gengshen Rebellion. It was difficult to repair, so it was supported by wood. The wood was rotten and broken. Villagers who went to the market to carry firewood, vegetables, fruits, and grains had to detour. This continued for thirty years. They wanted to repair it, but everyone said there were no funds. The lady sadly pondered and took it upon herself. Before the project could begin, she passed away. Thereupon, her sons opened her coffer, examined her legacy, and wept, wanting to build this bridge to fulfill their mother's wish. They reported it to Shiyu. Shiyu said, "Yes." In the winter of the Gengwu year, when the frost fell and the floods subsided, they entrusted the supervisor to procure materials and lay the foundation. They gathered the workers and built the bridge in thirty days. It was a curved arch, containing the waves and channeling the flow. The carving and chiseling were firm and complete, as smooth as jade. Elderly women from the two villages across the ferry sighed in praise by the river. Suddenly, passage was easy, and travelers thronged. They praised the lady's legacy of love and wished to carve it in stone for eternity, naming it "Lady Hu Bridge" to show its substance. Shiyu said, "My old friend, Jin Junwen, is skilled in epigraphy. He should write the record." So I wrote it. The total cost of labor, axes, chisels, stones, lime, and mortar was a certain amount of gold, which was reported to the village chief. This is not recorded here. What is recorded is the lady's noble righteousness. May future gentlemen repair it from time to time, and not fail to uphold her achievements. (Paid Editorial)</p>
<h3>Dragon Mound Mountain on March 28th</h3>
<p>— Huai Bing</p>
<p>Before I lived near a village, I didn't know that the lunar calendar's "March 28th" was a significant festival in towns. There are incense gatherings, theatrical performances, and other activities everywhere. However, the Dragon Mound Mountain in Weiting is especially unique and grand. On the 28th and 29th, a temple in the mountain hosts plays. Villagers from within a hundred li flock to the gathering. There are a total of hundreds of thousands of people, with thousands of boats moored, covering the river's surface. The reason it can reach such a grand scale is because of a village custom. All newly married women must accompany their grooms back to their mothers' homes for a banquet on the new March 28th. The more guests at the table, the more prestigious it is considered. At the same time, the newly married couple, accompanied by friends and relatives, take a fast boat to Dragon Mound Mountain to watch a play. It's like a honeymoon in the new wedding rituals and is seen as an important ceremony. Because of this, the gathering on Dragon Mountain is always crowded, without needing to solicit famous opera troupes to attract people. Therefore, there is a local saying, "Annoying Dragon Mound Mountain." However, despite saying "annoying," the enthusiasm for the gathering never diminishes. Returning in boats through the town, they compete to be first, following one another closely. It takes two or three hours for all the boats to pass, which is enough to illustrate the grandness of the occasion.</p>
<h3>A Record of Three Visits to Gusu</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Since I settled in Shanghai, I have visited Suzhou twice. In the late spring of Xinwei, I again traveled with patriotic female students for a third visit. Spring rain fell, and wading through the mud and water was particularly delightful. Although the rivers and mountains remained unchanged, human affairs had undergone some changes. I will record them briefly for future viewing.</p>
<p>Nine Orchids: At the time, the Lingering Garden was hosting an orchid exhibition. Rare species from Hunan and unique orchids emitted fragrances that assailed the senses, like entering the home of a virtuous person. Red ones were called Swallowtail, white ones were called Fish Fins. The red pistils pleased the eye, and the purple petals delighted the heart. Their elegant essence, spiritual roots, and antique fragrance surpassed all other flowers. It's not just competing with autumn chrysanthemums for beauty or matching the loveliness of Chinese peppertrees.</p>
<p>Three Journeys: This was my third trip to Suzhou. The patriotic female student was in the third year of junior high school. Together with my son, Xin, they made up the number three seven. We stayed in three rooms at the Three New Inn for three days. It was also the third month of late spring. In groups of three, we held hands and strolled through the scenic spots of Wu. Some visited the Buddha of the Three Treasures, while others ascended the Hall of the Three Purities. We looked at the Three Yuan Archway, viewed the Third Spring, admired the Pillow Stone of Qiu Xiang's Three Smiles, and peeked at the Sword Pond with three thousand buried swords. Climbing the nine-story North Temple Pagoda that stood high into the clouds, we looked out over the vastness of the 36,000 hectares of Tai Lake. We truly had the ambition of a Peng bird flying 90,000 li.</p>
<p>Two Yu: Yu Jianhua from Taicang was a prominent figure in the Southern Society's literary scene. Because he shared the same name as me, we became friends. He is currently recuperating at home. His son, Chenghui, is studying at the Suzhou Art School. I made a special trip to introduce Xin to him. Their faces looked very similar, like brothers. Those who accompanied us smiled and called them the two little Yu Jianhuas.</p>
<p>One Yamen: We visited Suzhou Middle School. The facilities were exquisite, the management was perfect, and the number of students was large. It was divided into five schools and was the best middle school in Jiangsu Province. Among the biological specimens was a hornet's nest, as large as a dou (a unit of dry measure), the color of sandalwood, and with patterns like tides. Peeking inside, the thousands of doors and households were arranged neatly. The hornets were more than an inch long, and their stings could be fatal. It was said that there were no less than tens of thousands. It could be called the largest hornet yamen in the world.</p>
<p>Half Red: Some students wore red flannel shirts on their upper bodies. When they walked through the city, the people of Suzhou were greatly astonished and pointed at them. They were just people who had seen little and wondered much.</p>
<h3>Examination of Fans</h3>
<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>The fan is a useful object, with many styles. In ancient times, there were no folding fans, but feather fans, round fans, and silk fans were popular. (Shuowen) A fan is a door leaf. It consists of "door" and "wing," with a simplified phonetic component. (Li Yue Ling) To repair doors and windows. (Yang Zi Fangyan) East of the Guan Pass, it's called a 　; west of the Guan Pass, it's called a fan, also known as a chou. (Cui Bao's Ancient and Modern Notes) Emperor Shun widely observed and listened, seeking virtuous people to assist him, and made five bright fans. (Han Shu) Ban Jieyu lost favor and composed the Round Fan Song in the palace. (Preface to Cao Zhi's Nine-Flowered Fan of Wei) When my late father served Emperor Huan, he was given a bamboo fan from above, neither round nor square, with patterns of nine flowers woven within. (Records of the Three Kingdoms) Zhuge Liang of Shu wore a scarf and held a feather fan. (Jin Shi) Wang Xizhi was in Shanyin when an old woman held a hexagonal bamboo fan. Xizhi wrote five characters for her and asked for a hundred coins. Xizhi also painted round fans with seven treasures. Descending to later generations, fans have often been mentioned in poetry, such as the Tang poem, "The cloud moves the pheasant tail, opening the palace fan," and "The fan is cut from the moon's essence, ashamed to be easily hidden." The Song poem, "Every family paints round fans, Fang Weng," were all widely recited at the time. Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, folding fans began to appear gradually. Elegant scholars all sought famous people to write or paint on the fan surfaces, considering it an honor. This is something that antiquarians can follow like a clue. An old friend, Sun Zixue, is good at making fans. His calligraphy and painting are exquisite. Recently, he has been engaged in improving fan making, extensively collecting fan designs, and inviting famous painters to paint them, making them available to the public. At the beginning of the launch, he plans to publish a special edition of round fans to explain their origins and development for reference.</p>
<p>According to the Round Fan Painting Exhibition, over a thousand painted fans by various famous painters have been collected. The Round Fan Exhibition will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of this month. The quality of the works is universally admired. Those who love to see round fans should not miss this opportunity. (Yan Zi's Postscript)</p>
<h3>Preface to Madam Zheng Zhang's Eightieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Jiang Meisheng</p>
<p>The so-called virtuous mothers of ancient times were able to replace the roles of fathers and teachers with righteous teachings, so that their children were gradually immersed in virtue and art from childhood, and grew up skilled in wisdom, courage, and eloquence. In action, they were guides for commoners; in stillness, they presided over the clear opinions of the time, with firm principles and strong defenses. Wealth and fame could not sway them, and power and force could not subdue them. Only then could a commoner's reputation surpass that of dukes and ministers, and even a bereaved widow's success could rival that of creation. This is truly a bright star in history, and a unique characteristic of China. What is recorded in the books is even more abundant. Meng Mu used three moves to forge a sage; Tao Mu encouraged integrity with pickled fish. Fortunately, she was the mother of Ouyang Yongshu, whose benevolent words were passed down, and her fame was secure. Unfortunately, she was the mother of Fan Mengbo, whose integrity was fulfilled, and sacrifice was nothing. The other trivial matters need not be fully stated. Since this way is not clear, those who teach children in the world only hope that they will gain the glory of officialdom, and those who speak of longevity to mothers only exaggerate the nobility of their families, and the abundance of their wealth, considering it difficult to achieve in this generation and rare in ancient and modern times. They do not consider the root and only pursue the branches. Therefore, gentlemen lament the changes in the world. We, the members of our party, seeing the mother of Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, then know that the style of ancient virtuous mothers is not far from us. Madam Zheng is the daughter of the Zhang family, a prominent family in Chaoyang, Guangdong. After reaching marriageable age, she married Zheng Rangqing. Zheng Zheng obtained a vice tribute status in the Shun Tian provincial examination and began his official career in Jiangsu. Madam Zheng, because her kind mother was still alive, wished to stay in her hometown to support and care for her. She anticipated her mother's wishes and served her with utmost respect. She lived frugally, and if any relatives were sick or in need, she would provide assistance within her means, with a fixed amount each year, without ever diminishing. She always participated in disaster relief and charitable activities. Therefore, the villagers praised her and called her a living Bodhisattva. Rangqing had several concubines, and Madam Zheng was able to treat them with kindness and never spoke ill of them. In her later years, when the concubines scattered, Madam Zheng treated all the children they left behind as her own, teaching and instructing them diligently. These ordinary virtues were already enough to record in the annals and inscribe on bronzes. However, that is not her greatest achievement. Since Rangqing passed away, Mr. Zhengqiu was only a young boy. If it were not for the virtuous mother above, who could also serve as a strict teacher, shaping him day and night, how could he have cultivated his conduct and established his name as a model for society today? Looking at Mr. Zhengqiu's aspirations and actions, since the end of the Qing Dynasty, he had no desire for officialdom. He successively presided over the writing of newspapers of the Democratic Party, and his arguments were strong and upright, based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, to promote the tide of national revolution. During the years of Xinhai and Renzi, many relatives and friends criticized him, but Madam Zheng alone praised and encouraged him. She also believed that reforming customs was most effectively done through new dramas. Therefore, upon Madam Zheng's order, he gathered like-minded people and established a new drama club in Shanghai. He showed subtle methods to all sectors of society. The people of Shanghai were inspired and gradually recognized the true meaning of national revolution and the progress of world culture. When the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai in the sixteenth year, the masses cheered, and all trades served willingly, without any doubts or fears. Tracing back to the source, it was all due to Mr. Zhengqiu's propaganda, and also to Madam Zheng's wise plans. In recent years, the new drama trend has declined, and movies have emerged. Mr. Zhengqiu has joined the Star Film Company as a director and taught his son, Xiaoqiu, to act as an actor. His heart for reforming customs has been growing ever stronger. Shen Yu and others are fortunate to be attached to the end of the friendship and have heard of her great beauty. They use the method of ancient virtuous mothers nurturing their children to show that the Zheng family of today is in perfect agreement. On this auspicious day, with joy at the door, they respectfully offer this speech before Madam Zheng, wishing her a long life. This is the preface. In the auspicious month of the Meng Xia of the 20th year of the Republic of China, your foolish nephews Yan Shenyu, Yang Xueyun, Bi Jingqian, Shen Siqi, Zhang Zhenyuan, Mi Jifang, Gu Kenfu, Wang Longchao, Min Binfu, Xie Jikang, Leng Xueqiao, and Fan Shuhan respectfully offer their congratulations. Composed by Jiang Meisheng of Yangxian. Written by Su Xinzha of Yangyang.</p>

<h3>The Turning Point in the Hawthorne Case (24)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>(8) What You Sow is What You Reap</p>
<p>At this point, Hawthorne had paid the bill for the three of us. He stood up, put on a dark woolen overcoat, patted it, and then whispered in my ear, "Take another look. Do you recognize that man who is about to walk out of the glass door?" Qiu Kui looked carefully and suddenly stood up. A cry of surprise involuntarily escaped his lips. I then realized that Qiu Kui had only seen the back of this scoundrel in his coat that night. No wonder he only recognized him now. Hawthorne then stopped him, saying, "Keep it down. I advise you to use your hands rather than your mouth, and you must listen to my orders to escape." Before Hawthorne finished speaking, Qiu Kui had already rushed out the door. Hawthorne glanced at me, straightened his collar, and we picked up our hats and walked towards the glass door. Hawthorne deliberately walked in front and slowed down his pace, clearly trying to stop me. Although my heart was burning with impatience, I couldn't rush ahead.</p>
<p>A moment later, as we just walked out of the restaurant's main door, we heard a crisp slapping sound. I could no longer restrain myself and quickly walked down the steps. Looking back to the east, the road was quiet. The young man was on the sidewalk, but his chest had been grabbed by Qiu Kui's powerful left hand. Qiu Kui's right hand, with its giant palm, was repeatedly hitting the young man's left and right cheeks. He was also constantly cursing, "Liar, liar." At this time, the woman who was with him was also so scared that she leaned against the wall, raising her jade hands to cover her eyes, as if she was about to faint. Qiu Kui had beaten this scoundrel at a location about three or four storefronts away from the restaurant's steps. We stood in front of the steps for a minute or two. Hawthorne suddenly coughed deliberately, seemingly sending a signal to Qiu Kui. Qiu Kui seemed not to hear it and continued to strike the young man's head and chest non-stop. Strangely, this treacherous scoundrel, apart from waving his hands in the air and making some ineffective resistance, remained silent. From afar, I could see that his face was already bleeding. If he went any further, danger might occur. At this time, Hawthorne coughed a second time, and the sound wave increased in volume. This signal immediately took effect. I saw Qiu Kui's left hand release its stone-like fist, which made one last contact with the young man's chest. This scoundrel, named Che Shijie, immediately fell backward onto the ground. At the same time, Qiu Kui quickened his pace and walked east.</p>
<p>As we slowly walked closer to the location of the beating, Che Shijie had already gotten up from the ground with the support of a passerby wearing short clothes. On Shijie's red and swollen left cheek hung two bright red lines of blood. His breathing was labored and pitiful. He seemed to want to show his courage, making a gesture to chase after him. In fact, this action was just to save face and he actually dared not chase. But the passerby in short clothes was trying his best to dissuade him.</p>

<p>Youth Garden</p>
<h3>To the Ye Family Garden</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>The lovely spring has awakened. The vast sky contains a great amount of sweet and charming smiles facing the world. In the boundless sea, there are also surging green waves. It is as if the beautiful scarlet goddess has specially given the young men and women in their youth a divine cup filled with light and joy. The earth is so soft and gives so much grace. Oh, what a time to celebrate and praise.</p>
<p>My friends — Huang and Chen, as well as my sister Ying — watching this tempting good time, unwilling to let it lightly pass under our eyes, initiated a spring outing on a Sunday afternoon. The destination was temporarily set as the Ye Family Garden in West Shanghai. Naturally, this news was very welcome to me, who loves to travel so much. But in order for us to gain a lot of interest, it was decided that each person would be responsible for finding comrades, at least one person each. At the same time, they stipulated that the meeting place that day was in my sister's school, which was the most suitable.</p>
<p>The short three days usually pass so quickly and easily, but at this time — with our hearts eager for travel — it felt long, long. But even so, the Sunday we were looking forward to finally arrived.</p>
<p>The first to arrive at my sister's school was me, followed by Chundi and Dedi, and then Huang and Shen. When they came, they were all implementing the resolution, with at least two people. I was the only exception. I was alone because I originally wanted to go with Cheng Yi, but who knew that she was taken home by her aunt to celebrate the festival. In addition, I had no other comrades, so I had to come alone, prepared to be punished. But who knew that they would forget about this matter in this harmonious atmosphere. This was really my great fortune. As for who found the most companions, it was of course my sister, because her roommates, Wang, Lü, and Tang, were already happily waiting to depart. Especially funny was Tang, who originally did not want to go back because she had a toothache and her face was bandaged, making her afraid she would look unsightly. But later, when she saw that we had not yet departed, she was so excited that she could not restrain herself. So she braved the toothache and resolutely joined our group. I still remember Huang once teasing her like this:</p>
<p>"Miss Tang, go, it doesn't matter. It's better to let it feel the wind and hurt as much as possible, so that the root of the pain will be completely gone, and it will never hurt again in the future." This sentence, although a bit humorous, had the meaning of "a poison must be treated with poison," and finally caused a joyful laughter among us.</p>
<p>We left my sister's school, with a total of eleven people, all squeezed into a public bus going to Shangjiangwan. Thus, even if this bus was originally very empty, it would have to be full at this time, let alone that it was not very empty to begin with. The road was so uneven, so the bus swayed like a cradle. Thus, the noise of our group of reckless young people almost burst the bus. I clearly heard an old lady sitting near Wang and Lü say to her companion, "Look, this group of young students are so happy. As soon as they come up, this bus becomes so noisy." Ah, dear old lady, in this sentence of yours, you made me fully understand the meaning buried in your heart. It is so much envy of us and mourning for your old youth. Ah, my lovely young comrades, quickly come and enjoy the joy of your youth, do not let her down, lest you feel sad in the future.</p>
<p>The bus could only go as far as the Racecourse. From the Racecourse to Yeyuan, we unanimously agreed to use our own two legs. Because Yuan and I bought some food at the station, we fell far, far behind their large group. But Yuan and I were unwilling to fall behind, so we worked hard to catch up, practicing the 100-meter race. As a result, I won, but I knew I had suffered a loss in Huang's sentence to Chundi, "Okay, I've bought champagne." Yuan and I were treated as horses by them.</p>
<p>When we entered the gate of Yeyuan, we confusedly took out a visitor's pass to the guard. He naturally did not allow us to enter, but we had many people, and we had already mixed into the head gate in one surge. He had no way to stop us and had to let us shout "ma ma hu hu".</p>
<p>Just as we were about to reach the summit, my sister met Miss Chen and her friend again. Taking advantage of the fact that everyone stopped working, Wang and Lü walked to a pool, pointing to a large stone crab, shouting "stone turtle." Soon, my sister and Miss Shen met their acquaintances again, two very fat madams. When Yuan saw them, he hurriedly pulled me and told me to look at their short and thick legs. At first, I didn't understand why he wanted me to see them. Afterwards, he said, "They both ate fertilizer powder," and I suddenly understood. At the same time, I blamed Yuan, saying that he was too harsh.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I don't know how, Huang actually left our group and went to another place alone. We all thought he was lost. We had to look for him, but the garden was so big and there were so many tourists. How could we find him? So we had to sit bored on the grass by a spring pool waiting for him. During this boring waiting period, I used her clever surgery to weave a garland with a willow branch and many kinds of flowers, and put it on my sister's head, who was particularly happy today, and told her to dance. Thus, the song "...This is my home..." and joyful dance once again broke the air that had suddenly suffocated us, and returned to the happy situation when we first came. At this time, other tourists standing by the road were all facing us with faces containing subtle smiles. I guessed that their psychology was probably also envying us.</p>
<p>The missing Huang also came back smiling at this time, and we started our garden tour again.</p>
<p>I remember that in the end we went to a very large lawn. At this time, there happened to be several Cantonese people playing small leather balls on the lawn. Perhaps the consciousness of being the king because there were many people was dominating us. We didn't even say hello, and ignoring everything, we grabbed the ball and kicked it. Although none of us were seen to be clever at kicking the ball, but because we were too happy, we didn't care about making a fool of ourselves. The most amusing of course was the short Tang, who was so short, but she liked to grab the ball and kick it, and the ball that was kicked out was so far - only one times higher than herself. This was really a place that had to be recognized as a joke. Later, when our interest in the ball was almost tired, I realized that this field had been turned into a situation where the guests were overwhelming the host. Because the original owners had all withdrawn from the court at this time and were just watching from the sidelines. Oh, how much this made us feel difficult to be sentimental.</p>
<p>In the twilight, we stepped on the green, carpet-like road home, each holding a heart full of joy, and returned to our school.</p>
<h3>After Seeing the 菁莪 Drama Society's "A Patriotic Heart"</h3>
<p>— Tang Naixin</p>
<p>The 菁莪 Drama Society's "A Patriotic Heart" was recently performed at Tongji University. I drove to see it this past Tuesday. Upon arrival, the guests were numerous, and there wasn't an empty seat to be found, which is enough to show how popular the drama is. Before the play started, what preoccupied my mind was that patriotic dramas should be able to move people with emotion. If the performance is not appropriate, it is easiest to lose the spirit of the original play, or become a strange, nondescript drama. The 菁莪 Drama Society's performance must have many outstanding features for people to appreciate. However, given the profound meaning and tight plot of the play, I couldn't help but feel apprehensive. I didn't know whether the members of the 菁莪 Drama Society had the ability to convey the spirit of the play. Thus, my doubts remained unresolved, and my eagerness for the play to begin was as urgent as a shooting star. Soon, the curtain slowly rose, and what caught my eye was a Japanese-influenced family. The actors' every move and every smile almost perfectly matched the scenes in the play. Compared to the images I had vaguely constructed in my mind when reading the synopsis, they felt doubly real. Even those who had not read the synopsis or were unfamiliar with the plot would not find it difficult to experience a special kind of pleasure from watching it.</p>
<p>The 菁莪 Drama Society is organized by students from Shanghai Law College and the Patriotic Girls' School. The play was written by Xiong Fosi and directed by Gu Zhongyi. The wording and the script were almost exactly the same. The dialogue in the play was particularly fluent and smooth, without any drag. As for the actors' casting, it can be said that the right people were chosen. Among them, Ms. Jin Guangmei, who played Qiu Zi, and Ms. Liu Sifen, who played Ya Nan, were outstanding talents. Ms. Jin's makeup was very similar to that of a Japanese woman, and her delicate expressions and clear enunciation were even more commendable. In the first act, when describing the process of Mrs. Tang's marriage to her husband, the line "Now that I think about it, it still makes my heart ache" moved all the viewers. Later, when they fought to hang the Japanese flag and retrieve the mining contract, their patriotic attitude was overflowing. As for Ms. Liu Sifen, her demeanor was like that of a delicate and beautiful young girl. Her clear and melodious voice was like pearls rolling on a plate, adding a lot of color to the entire play. In the first act, when she was thrown into her mother's arms because of the flag hanging, begging for forgiveness, it was even more apparent that she was considerate and just right. As for Ms. Gao Yunying, who played Zhou Zhifang, her expressions and dialogues all had unique qualities.</p>
<p>Overall, the performance's subtlety, the background's realism, and everything else were all lifelike and superior. While watching, I couldn't help but be fascinated. After watching, I still felt a lingering aftertaste. In addition to trying its best to vividly depict patriotic fervor, the play also vividly described the love of family. The final scene of parents and children crying together received thunderous applause in the hall, and some even shed tears. Its stimulation of the audience reached such a point that it can be called divine. Feeling inspired, I hereby describe its special features for those who have not seen it.</p>

<h3>The Sandman and the Teacher</h3>
<p>— Zhenghong</p>
<p>"Ding..." A lazy but threatening school bell drove us into the classroom. This was the first class in the afternoon, and it was an uninteresting English class, so everyone felt lazy and a little unhappy.</p>
<p>The teacher came in. After marking the attendance sheet, he opened the reader, stretched his neck, and straightened his chest slightly, obviously trying to perk himself up. He began to teach a subject that he himself didn't like very much.</p>
<p>At first, the teacher's voice was very clear, but later it became lower and lower, turning into a continuous, lazy, hypnotic tone. I don't know if it was our own ears playing tricks, or if his voice really changed. A warm breeze, rustling, blew in from the window, also carrying drowsiness. Gradually, the words on the book in front of us floated, and the teacher's voice became blurry. The sandman approached from all sides, overcoming the classroom. Several students, unconsciously, gradually closed their eyelids, supporting their heads with their hands. Some couldn't hold on any longer and collapsed on their desks.</p>
<p>In this dreamlike state, we forgot where we were. Whether the teacher blamed us or our conscience blamed us, we couldn't care less. In fact, at this time, there was no time for thought, and we didn't even know that we were falling asleep. Moreover, this time after a meal is not suitable for studying but for a nap, so we naturally fell asleep. This situation is exactly the opposite of sleeping at night. At night, we often don't feel tired at all, but the annoying bedtime bell forces us to go to sleep. Lying on the bed, we keep thinking about sleeping, but we can't fall asleep.</p>
<p>In the sandman's control, suddenly we seemed to hear a cough, and then a very loud voice, shattering our unstable dreams. The voice said, "I'll ask you," followed by "Li Zhen, analyze this sentence." We couldn't help but slightly open our disturbed and resentful eyes and looked up blankly, thinking that we would meet the teacher's stern gaze. However, it was not so. His gaze was full of pity and envy, as if saying, "You're all so relaxed."</p>
<p>At this time, Li Zhen slowly stood up, hesitated for a while, and made a "um" sound in her throat. A classmate sitting next to her immediately knew that her difficulty was in not knowing which sentence was being asked, so she indirectly asked, "Teacher, please explain this sentence again, the meaning is not very clear." In this way, as soon as the teacher explained, Li Zhen quickly analyzed it.</p>
<p>After explaining for a while, the teacher said in a gentle voice, "Let's have less class today. The weather makes you so unmotivated, but please go and see after class..." Clearly, this was his apology for the disturbance just now.</p>
<p>As soon as the class bell rang, the teacher quickly walked out of the classroom, as if he had just escaped from a long siege.</p>

<h3>The Most Glorious Page of the Emden Battleship</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The German Emden warship that recently came to Shanghai has an Iron Cross relief on its bow. This is a symbol commemorating the merits of the old Emden, which is also the most glorious page of the Emden warship in the history of the war. There were three Emden cruisers in total. What is being said now is the immortal second ship. During the first few months of the start of the war, it cruised in the Indian Ocean, repeatedly making great achievements. Later, it was sunk by the Australian cruiser Sydney off the Cocos Islands. In order to commemorate her merits, German Emperor Wilhelm II specially approved a special motion by the cabinet to grant the ship name "Emden" to the 150 surviving crew members as their surname. The current German cabinet has re-passed this law, so that the name of Emden will be passed down for centuries. The original author of this article, Hans Haas</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Hamsh Emden, is one of the surviving crew members of the old Emden. What is described is a thrilling story before and after the sinking of the Emden. It is translated as follows:</p>
<p>At the beginning of this article, I would like to pay tribute to the commander of the new Emden warship currently visiting Shanghai. Captain Weideford was originally the first mate of the old Emden. Among the officers I know, he is the most outstanding. He is a capable and intelligent leader, humble and loving, without the arrogant habits of later officers. Therefore, all crew members, large and small, did not fail to love and support him. I dare say that anyone who knew him in the old days must be very pleased to hear that he is now commanding the new Emden.</p>
<p>The crew prepared on the old Emden warship were all Germans selected, and they had to be healthy, of good character, and competent to be selected. Naval enlistment had a term of four years, and the peacetime supply was extremely meager. The army served for only two years, but the number of volunteers joining the navy often exceeded the quota.</p>
<p>When I was eighteen years old, my parents decided to send me to an industrial university to study for four years. Before leaving home, he allowed me to travel to the North Sea once. When I arrived in Wilhelmshaven, I saw him (referring to Emden) with his majestic and dazzling appearance, which I admired very much. So I was willing to join the navy, and from then on I was reluctant to return, and soon after, my parents allowed me to join the navy. At first, he insisted that I go to university, but later he changed his mind. This was probably because it cost twice as much to go to university. I was born in Get Harbor, and they often regarded me as an Englishman. Even later when I was a prisoner, the British authorities in Malta spent two days investigating whether I was German or English.</p>
<p>My willingness to join the navy was also due to my nature. My father and grandfather were both sailors, and my brother had already joined the navy. He was sunk in the Falkland Islands battle at the same time as the "Newburgh" warship.</p>
<p>Encounter with the Sydney</p>
<p>At the outbreak of the war, Emden was stationed in the Indian Ocean station. Thanks to good fortune and the talent of Captain von Müller, we performed very well. Many ships were captured by us, and many were sunk by us, while we only suffered minor losses and luckily escaped difficulties.</p>
<p>Our activities finally stopped at Cocos in November 1914. At that time, because our position was very unfortunate, the other side used his precise military strategy, longer range, and increased speed. The Australian cruiser Sydney sunk our ship. Except for forty-nine people, they were either killed or captured alive.</p>
<p>I will never forget the two days of fear before Emden's death. At that time, we were staying in the coral reef harbor next to the island. On the morning of November 9, Colonel Maukai led forty-nine people ashore to destroy the enemy's target telegraph station. This was an easy task. I remember standing on the deck with several other crew members and watching the telegraph station's mast fall to the ground.</p>
<p>When the sun rose, a small group of people laughed and talked on the deck. Everything looked calm and peaceful. Everyone was very happy. This story seems to be what the old woman said, superstitious and not credible. An unfortunate omen made me appear melancholy and pessimistic among my companions. Several people criticized me for being unhappy, so I replied that I had a nightmare the night before, and the Emden's deck was covered in red blood. Many of the faces I knew well, who are now smiling, were miserable and terrible in the dream, like the crew members on the ships that we sunk. I also told my companions that I felt this was the last time we would see the sunrise. Before meeting "Sydney," I recorded this in my diary. After the battle, it proved that my intuition was not an illusion. Later I also learned that two of my companions had the same dream. (To be continued)</p>
