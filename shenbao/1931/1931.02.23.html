<p>時評</p>
<h3>南美之革命潮</h3>
<p>前者南美國有革命之亂時我曾言之所以革命之故爲因經濟困難故非爲政治故因國内經濟之困難而怨恨及於政府欲以革命改變政府以紓經濟之困難然此次各國之經濟困難由於世界普遍之商業衰落而非由於一國之失政故革命之後對於國民之經濟决無所補而民間之不滿意也如故革命政府執政之後繼其後之革命又將繼起此乃出於無可如何之事也今南美各國之國内不穩之消息又復傳矣如秘魯之又起政變巴拉圭之共産黨活動卽其讀也</p>

<h3>陜西省民國二十年建設事業計畫大綱</h3>
<p>▲陜省政府擬定</p>
<p>西北爲我國之天府、陜甘書寗新五省、富源之藴於地中産於地面者、何可勝計、政府而欲鞏固西北邊陲、植萬年副强之基、誠非努力於此五省之</p>
<p>開發、别無善策、陜省據黄河之上游、扼西北之衝要、内通全國富庶之區、外　家疆遼闊之域、</p>
<p>欲增加國富、固須開發西北而開發西北、尤必先從陜西入手、十餘年來關中多事、軍閥割據、民不聊生、益以四年奇荒、野無靑草、欲圖建設、誠非易易、然有志竟成、事在人爲、苟有自强不息之心、必能漸躋光明之城、兹値二十年履端之始、　依一　年中應行計劃設施之建設事業、根據後列三條辦法、編爲計畫大綱、以作進行張本、在未述計畫以前請先言其辦法、</p>
<p>（一）陜省民　財困、達於極點、興辦建設事業、非有賴於中央之力不能必其成功、如建築　　、設立黄河大水電廠、整理黄渭航路交通、開採延長油鐘等事、省方財力、實有未逮、均須中央積極辦理、</p>
<p>（二）範圍較小之交通及實業、統由省政府積極計畫努力建設、以符先總理建國大綱之規定、與中央設施相應、</p>
<p>（三）由中央奬勵提倡國内專家、來陜考察研究、並奬勵實業家來陜投資、此事統由省政府切實助理、合力進行、</p>
<p>以上三項、係按陜省實在情形、斟酌擬定、其屬於本省範圍、應次第舉行者、須按其收效遲速利益大小、以定施行之程序、務於最短期間、以次推廣、使百廢俱興、民生有賴、</p>
<p>第一　關於建設事業之財政、</p>
<p>建設事業之進展、人力財力、兩不可缺、陜省喪亂之餘、財源枯竭、欲圖建設、財力實須考慮、擬於本年内由省政府集資數百萬元、設一陜西實業銀行於西安、並請財部准其發行紙幣、以爲陜、西建設事業之基金、以後營業發達、再次第於各省設立分行、如上海　州蘭州寗夏西寗肅州等地、均有設行之必要、因此數處、皆陜西商人足跡所至、西北貨物、咸賴其委輸以達遠東南各省、彼等向苦無相當銀行、以爲匯兌存儲之所、影響商業、損失實巨、如陜西實業銀行、能以鞏固設施則營業之日趨昌盛、可以斷言、而陜省一切建設事業、得此有力之後援、自然迎刄而解矣、</p>
<p>第二　關於交通者除隴海同成等鐵路、須待中央積極設施外、其汽車公路長途電話等項之擬於最短期内完成或查勘設計者、約有八端、</p>
<p>（甲）西潼汽車路、此路係由西安東展、經臨潼渭南華縣華陰等四縣、以達潼關、共長約一百五十公里、擬就現有十道加以整理、並於衝要之段、如西安至臨潼三十公里間、潼關至華陰廟及華山麓二十公里間、均鋪石渣路而計畫、約共需洋十五萬元、</p>
<p>（乙）西長汽車路、此路係由西安向西北展經咸陽醴泉乾縣永壽邠縣等五縣、以達長武、共長約一百八十公里、擬先就土道整理、以利陜甘交通計畫、每公里平均需費五百元、共約需九萬元、（丙）西鳳汽車路、此路係由咸陽西長路起、向西展經興平武功扶風岐山等四縣、以達鳳翔、再由鳳翔向西北展經汧陽縣、以達隴縣、共長約二百三十公里、工事一如西長路、惟汧隴一帶、略有山嶺、每公里需費以五百元計算、共約需一十一萬五千元、</p>
<p>（丁）西輪汽車路、此路亦係由咸陽西長路起向北展、經涇陽三原耀　同官宜召中部　縣甘泉　施延長延川淸澗綏德米脂等十四縣、以　　林、共長約七百公里、同民之煤爲西安附近必需之品、西安煤價値三十餘元一噸、良以交通不便之故、擬將同官通至淸南交口一段汽車路、平其坡度、增　路幅、改設輕便　道軌寬一公尺、軌條重十八磅、共長約一百零五公里、計須敷設車輛費五十二萬餘元、</p>
<p>此路修成後、卽須計畫向北進展、以達榆林三　、爲淸北商業繁盛之區、　口鎭濱於渭水、當關中産棉中心、且距西潼路之零口站不過五六公里、將來於此地設紡織廠、供給以清北富有之棉、濟之以同官充裕之煤、必成爲工業中心之地、耀縣岔口地方、可設水電廠一所、擬爲電馭鐵道車輛之用、惟未經詳察調查、尚須研究、</p>
<p>以上四路均擬於本年内完成、惟西安西鳳西　三路、均須由西安西經咸陽渡渭、然後　　而馳、渭河橋梁、至須建築、計畫築以石橋、約需三十萬元、西榆路咸陽至涇陽一段、尚須越渡涇河、計畫于涇河修石渡口、亦築石橋一座、約需十五萬元、此二橋若能架修、則西潼西長西榆等汽車道、均可永久聯運、于　通上大有利便、</p>
<p>（戊）西　汽車路中北段、此段由同官以至榆林、長約六百公里、經過中部延長等十縣、中部爲黄帝陸寢所在、延長爲陜北石油中心、榆林爲本省北門鎖鑰、沿路所經、非毛絨皮革生産之區、卽墾植畜牧極適之地、神木之　、定邊之鹽、均有發展希望、而府谷神木榆林等地之煤炭、直與三晉品質嫓美、實有修築汽車路以通風氣之價値、惟山原重整、工程費事、計畫每公里平均五千元、共需三百萬元</p>
<p>（己）鳳漢汽車路、此路由鳳翔經寳　渡渭入秦嶺鳳縣留壩褒城等縣、以達南鄭、再東展至城固、計長約二百八十公里、漢中爲陜省富庶之區、物産緊盛、極待開發、此路一通、則北可以汽車逕達省會、東可以航船直下漢口、惟山路崎嶇、修築不易、每公里平均以一萬元估計、約共需二百八十萬元、渭橋一座、約需十萬元</p>
<p>（庚）西商汽車路、此路由西安經藍田以達商縣、向東南展以至龍駒寨、長約二百公里、商縣爲陜省東南門戸、由龍駒寨順丹河而下、可抵湖北之老河口、亦陜鄂交通之要道也、全路除西安至藍田一段、尚係平路外、餘均蜿蜒山谷、計畫　公里以一萬元、共需二百萬元、</p>
<p>以上三路、擬於本年内實地勘騐、詳　　　　待修築、此外如原大（三原至大荔）原醴</p>
<p>醴泉接西長路）等較長之綫之及各縣互通　　　均責成各縣次第修築、不由省政府直接設施、（辛）長　電話、擬分三期辦理、第一期先設西安達舊關　道各縣治、第二期設北達榆林南達南　二幹綫、第三期設南北二道　線、共約需三十萬元、（未完）</p>

<p>▲陶耐教授演詞　工業革命、在歐洲各國、當以英國爲最早、從十八世紀後、漸由法德而及於全歐、自二十四紀以後、乃傳入東亞各國、若日本中國等、至於工業革命之原因、計分兩方面、（一）經濟技術之改變、（二）社會組織之改變、而現代社會問題、當以勞資爲最重要、但勞資問題之發生、第一種是因工人組織工會、第二種是因工人組織合作運動、第三種是因工人組織工黨、據余個人的意見、組織政治運動、實屬是一種不重要工作、最重要者、第一是民衆的覺悟、由工人自己從下面一層層組織起來、産生一種新文化、此種新文化、是建築在民衆互助服務團結的基礎上、茲舉一例、如消費合作社、在英國有五百萬的家庭加入、共有一千五百萬的人、去建築民衆經濟消費問題、第二是民衆教育、使能養成良善的國民、第三是民衆政治、以英國而言、大城市之市政府、其政權大半在工人手裏、由工人去組織、假如現在英國工黨消滅、能再從民衆組織的力量、永久存在、至於英國的經濟改造政策、完全是改良主義、與大陸各國革命的主義不同、此種政策、共有四種、（一）提高民衆生活的程度、（二）擴充社會服務的範圍、（三）改良基本工業及大工業歸國有、（四）用大部份的捐稅、謀民衆的幸福、而實現政策的方法、不用武力、而用勞働立法、一方取締童工女工、加增工資·縮短工作時間、改善人工衞生、以及工作情形、一方普及教育、發展民衆知識、故現在雖有失業問題、將來當有方法可以解决、中國素來以農立國、而現在社會問題的中心、亦卽農民問題、中國應參考法國德國南部及丹麥國的經騐、蓋中國現在的農民問題、與歐洲從前相同、第一種是災患、第二種是農業生産方法不進步、第三種是缺少資本、現在皆可以參考歐洲以前的方法、去解决此種問題、其方法計、（一）整頓交通、（二）應用科學方法、（三）信用合用、關於工業方面問題、是否中國可以採用英美大工業制度、這是一個疑問、但是中國將來的現代工業、一定是要發展、所以中國應當研究英國過去之經騐、而舍去英國工業史上所有一切的弊病、而謀其發展云、</p>

<p>向育仁同志演說　大意謂、兄弟與諸位同志闊别已久、今天歡聚一堂、話舊於數千里外、這是非常高興的、若說歡迎、　就萬不敢當了、兄弟此次出川、一則是應胡　諸　生的電召、并無其他何種使命、外間傳說　　事實、二則個人因鬱居川省、也想藝此出來游歷、參觀各他建設、一新耳目、并且　諸　把晤、暢叙離　諸　同志、不是都　關心　　、　願　　故鄉的情形嗎、本來諸位出川稍久、故　情形、容有未盡明瞭之處少不得有一番問詢、而故鄉人因僻處一隅、囿於見聞、也有許多地方、要向諸位請教、不過兩來都難得機會罷了、說到川中情形、自然複雜得很、今天時間有限、祇好歸納起來、作一簡略報告、川省的一切、就外面的觀察和批評、好像無一事不落後、此話我們固然也不敢否認、其實吾川的教育建設軍事等等、并不是絶無發展、例如近年建築的川東川南川北各條馬路、長度已達三千里左右、工程不可謂不大、又如吾川軍隊、民九時統計不過數萬、民十五統計約二十萬、直至今日統計不下三十萬、加上民軍、何止六十萬、這種數量的增加、算不算發展嗎、但是這種發展、總不免是畸形的發展、因爲川省政治没有統一、缺乏整個的計劃、表現出來的、無非是些佊碎的象懲、就是建築馬路與乎增加軍隊的目標、大　都是各因其便、各就所需、說不上甚麽民衆利益社會需要、如其不然、有這樣長的交通線、吾川的工商業、也不會還是中古式的工商業了、有這樣多的武裝、不但在革命歷史上、有相當的價値、就要移到國際上去、也有相當的力量了、那裏還是這樣的四川、這都是很可惋惜的、至於吾川父老、旣要負擔多量的軍費、又要負擔漠不相關的築路費、以及其他種種的費、雖然宛轉呻吟、一天一天的覺着支持不易、但是内地民團、這幾年總算日有進步、地方秩序、大致尚可維持、比較湘鄂　各地的慘痛流離、究竟差勝一籌、未嘗非不幸中之幸事、然而吾川的危機、正濳伏着呢、思想派别的複雜、一言難盡、凡是共産黨·國家主義派·以及社會民主黨等等、應有盡有、大肆活動、無異各種主義的博覽塲、推想前途、眞是一件可驚可怖的事、要想怎樣去銷弭他們、少不得先要使他們失去各個的背景、他們的背景、就是迎合各因其便各就所需的心理、投機得來、如果川中一切、有了系统便可以化除各因其便各就所需的心理、種種不正確的思想派别、就没有容身之地了、此外就是兄弟此次出來、把經過各地方拿來比較一下、覺得吾川却有一種可喜的現象、乃是帝國主義者、對於我國的經濟侵略、在吾川還未達到十分的程度、何以見得就四大生活需要來說、上海這個地方自然不用說了、凡是食的衣的住的行的、那一宗免得了舶來之品、就是長江一帶、雖然比上海稍好、而輸人的亦復不少、較之吾川、除衣的毛棉絨各類紡織物、多半仰給外貨、其他食的住的行的、本省取之不盡用之不竭、至今藴藏天財地寳原封原樣、絲毫未動、豈不是一件堪告慰的事、這樣的地方、便是諸位同志和兄弟的故鄉、諸位關心桑梓、必有碩畫盡籌、應當爲桑梓負起責任、那麽、兄弟雖然爲游歷觀光而來、少不得也要洗耳聞教、并且還可以隨諸位之後、相機努力建白、如果能把我們的桑梓地方、根本上改革起來、建設一個新四川、那就是吾川七千萬人的幸福了、云、繼由</p>
<p>陳鳴謙同志演說　略謂、兄弟雖追隨革命先進多年、但是毫無建樹、今承諸位歡迎、愧不敢當、川局之不能解决、皆同志之無團結、應本今日團結之精神、共謀川事之解决、後由主席答辭、各同志自由演說畢、卽攝影散會、</p>
<h3>林康侯談美國銀借欵</h3>
<p>▲無擔保决不成功</p>
<p>▲未成熟故無表示</p>
<p>美銀十萬萬盎斯借華一事、近據各方所傳、將成事實、日日社記者昨因茲事、訪晤上海銀行公會常委林康侯氏、詢以本埠銀行界對於美錦借華一問題、究出於何種態度、林謂我國之所以希望美銀借華者、爲借得薄利與無擔保之欵項、用以發展中國之建設、然美國爲銀欵及商品之過剩、薄利貸欵於中國、事實上確有可能、但中國政府對此借欵、如無相當穩固之擔保、在美國議會、决難通過、卽無擔保之大借欵、决不能成爲事實、若我國政府亟謀國内之建設、而出於有擔保之借欵、則中國銀行界、在目前發展中國建設之過渡時期中、亦尚有擔任之力量、並不亟亟夫仰仗於國外之借欵、而我國銀行界、在最近數年、尚鮮投資於國家之建設者、其較大原因、爲中國頻年戰爭與政治上之各種影響、是以政府謀國家之建設、當先從政治走入正軌爲着手、現時國家統一、内亂敉平、苟得匪患肅淸、則國家經濟、潮趨發展、中國之初步建設、正無須仰仗於外資、所謂美銀借華、一旦實現、在中國之銀行界、此後當能减少政府發行公債及借欵等事、自當歡迎、但此一借欵、爲數旣大、將來如何償還之條件、實與中國全體人民、均有關係、所以不得不愼重考慮、然目前此事尚在醖釀中、在本年五月間之國民會議未舉行前、當不致成爲事實、是以上海銀行界、認爲此事旣未成熟、故尚無須正式表示云、</p>

<h3>昨日西人足球會賽眞茹獨勝十球</h3>
<p>丨樂華十人應戰丨</p>
<p>▲宜乎一敗墜地</p>
<p>樂華足球隊昨以零比十大敗於眞茹、觀眞茹陣線、當非最完善者、惟樂華僅到七人、臨時拉進三人、凑成十員應戰、非特不能克敵建功、卽前鋒欲越中線一步、當非易易、下半時中、僅九人對戰、以楊人偉陳虞添二人作前鋒、餘者均嚴守隊門、不出一步、眞茹雄師、雖獲十球、未見各盡智力、若努力工作、獲球奚止於是、樂華因周賢言在香港、昨日原定陸鍾恩充任、因陸因事不克出塲、不得已拉錢耀彬担任、錢固非此中能手、故難盡職、以致一誤再誤、鑽成大錯、</p>
<h3>地滑競爭疏懈</h3>
<p>競爭形勢疏懈、加以地上濘滑、實無精彩可言、樂華因鑒於前線殘缺、全軍乃退守後方、眞茹則包圍球門、自始至終、如連珠破之射擊、樂華陳虞添偶而有一二次自告奮勇、匹馬殺進、卒以孤掌難鳴、愛莫能助、進至半途、卽被裁回、難近球門一步、奈何奈何、</p>
<p>▲新將有羅海光</p>
<p>上半時中眞茹共獲六球、其得球者之次序如下、（一陳鎭和、（二）羅海光、（三）羅海光、（四）陳鎭和、（五）羅海光、（六）羅光光、下半時攻人四球、（七）陳鎭和、（八）陳家球、（九）　海光、（十）陳秉祥、總計羅海光獨進五球、陳鎭和三球、羅之脚頭甚健、始終不懈、且横掃樂華門前、不現疲倦之態、確係後進名將也、裁判員蔣湘靑、</p>

<h3>孫寳琦軼事補·名·恕</h3>
<p>▲滿淸時代　慕老正任山東巡撫。元年民軍起。朝右皇皇。慕老一電力請退位。舉朝失色。大局轉樞。而山東亦賴以保全。其洞達大勢如此。</p>
<p>▲項城時代　、慕老任外交總長。袁引爲私黨。一日召慕入宫。（時正民二戰勝民軍）袖示淸室退位詔曰。予受淸室命領國。今軍事定。可原璧歸趙矣。慕知其意。力言帝制不可復活。袁怫然退。又一日。袁至參議院。重申前說。慕再拒。袁不悅。結果國務卿一職。棄孫慕韓而用徐東海。此大原因。其不肯阿附如此。</p>
<p>▲曹錕時代　曹當國。需才輔弼。以慕老可欺以其方。以甘方餌之。洎支配閣員。實行獨裁制。卒以反對金佛郎案。爲左右窘。曹知范叔之寒。餽金爲卒歲資。慕老不納。謝之。其實樹廉潔如此。</p>

<p>有集衆人之財。爲施食會之創設者。芝加哥一地最稱講究。一日三餐。免費餉客。至今已數月矣。人有問其經濟之來源者。無人能答。然據傳聞。則此爲紅面凱波所主持。紅面凱波爲美國社會上之流氓皇帝。平日無惡不作。擁資千萬。以其面紅。因有紅面之號。今日乃有此大慈善之舉。所謂强盜發善心者是也。此外。如各商店亦時有兼營慈善事業者。或劃定某日至某日。以售出物價之幾分。劃付施食會。以救工人。一面且大登廣告。以廣招徠。水菓商人更異想天開。招募失業工人。權充沿途兜賣之人。工人旣可賺得工資。籍資温飽。而水菓之在外兜售。以失業工人爲招牌。銷路乃大增。主人所得遂遠勝於所失。計亦巧矣。</p>

<p>▲菩薩　昔黎黄陂大總統。有言曰「有飯大家吃。」故人均頌之爲「菩薩」。不意今又有一菩薩出現。卽上海職業指導所主任潘仰堯君。人咸以是稱之。其名雖近迷信。然意則確甚切合。蓋潘遇人丐之謀事者。未嘗拒絶。抱有求必應之旨。且允許於先。必盡力爲之設法。曾憶前年某日。潘應某君之託。特往某大書館。訪其經理。時經理方怕於辦公。且又深知潘之來意。故僅婉言敷衍。藉資搪塞。詎潘久坐不去。力持鎭靜。經理不耐。卒爲設法一位置。潘始興辭而去。其後人之感謝潘君者。遂上以菩薩二字之稱。蓋頌其德也。</p>
<p>▲笑匠　歐美滑稽電影明星。若卓别麟羅克輩。人均稱之爲「笑匠」今予所述者爲一東方笑匠。此人非他。卽二十日本刋所記「五四與革命」之費文寳君。費不僅曾在本刋屢撰妙趣之小品。引人發　。卽談吐中。亦時多笑料發現。嘗憶去夏物品交易所爲慶祝紀念。特在新寳華輪上作海外之狂歡游藝會。費君爲衆所嬲亦上臺作笑話奇談。一言一語。妙到毫顚。聽者無不捧腹。斯人斯技。誠不亞於王旡能江笑笑也。</p>

<h3>砆石古蹟被毁記</h3>
<p>馬敦瀛</p>
<p>吾鄉砆石。有雙山。古多奇蹟。自遜淸以還。漸見湮没。誠足惜也。客臘返里。與友作十日之遊。詎又失却連理松等數起。爰誌之。</p>
<p>連理松　審山之巓。有古松二。枝幹合而爲一。故曰連理。葉繁茂。遠望如華蓋。耐寒獨立於山巓之上。洵奇觀也。前年爲不肖之徒盜賣。里人亦未聞有究及之者。▲金剛像　紫薇山之麓有大寺。寺名惠力。香火甚盛。頭山門之金剛像。雄肆絶倫。傳爲唐宋間名匠所塑。晚近已屬罕觀矣。丁卯春。新埭巨火。金剛殿亦遭波及。可嘆也。</p>
<p>▲廻文壁　廻文壁在惠力寺之側、考其年代當在唐宋以上其磚疊如蘆蓆形。前年有西人見而異之。曾攝影留記。聞之故老。謂係仙成。後因惠力寺重建。此壁亦被拆毁。</p>
<p>▲淸蘿池　淸蘿池位於横港橋之北。池</p>
<p>水澄淸亦爲砆石古蹟之一。蓋此中有一段悲壯之事蹟在也。當洪楊之役。附近匪徒蠭起。有勇士周七周八弟兄兩人。生性剛强。捍衞鄉里。巷戰而死。其眷屬亦殉難此池。前年沈姓鳩工造屋。此池亦被塡去矣</p>
<p>上述四處古蹟。予每返里之時。常往遊。今已被毁。不禁衷心愴惻。感慨糸之。尚聞其他古蹟。亦有被毁者。此後雙山。未免减色。願里人士注意及之。</p>

<h3>南洋遊記（二一四）</h3>
<p>二十二日。華僑公學校長尤文寳來訪。邀至其校參勸。校懸西班牙人夫婦之像問之。蓋每年助該校經費不少。此西班牙人蓋營商務。與中國人有交誼故也。</p>
<p>二十三日。劉不理君遣其姪以汽車接看緬人之球會。是日大雨泥濘。入塲買二等票。人半盾。乃一廣方草地。中搭蓬以待觀客。塲外士女圍觀者不少。間有西洋人。天雨濛濛。人云在南洋賽球。以雨天爲宜。以避熱也。此日乃從遠地學校之緬人來同勃生學生比賽者。余問之人。緬生賽球。比華人如何。答以不如。旣而觀賽。二時許。見諸兒盤旋泥水中。各爲其球門拚命爭光。此種游戲。亦只合男子雄性爲之。若女性則不宜也。滾跌爭拉。尚勇於角力。吾亦不欲觀此泥鰍生活團也。但吾若用兵。則宜風雨雪夜。以事攻戰。而究之凡此鬥力之事。均非文明。因念孔子云。古者射不主皮。今則不然。春秋之衰。尚力漸重。今日完全尚力時代。雄性大發之世也。此鬥性不除。安望和平乥。託而士太初好射獵。繼而悔之。按賽球之運動。今世竟成一大問題。以吾評之。乃資本階級子弟所得賸餘利息太重。故有畸形教育。貴族游戲。若眞發達體力。最好用託翁教育法。根本推翻貴族式教育課程。加入勞動腕力工課、免得引誘子弟。爲此不生産之功課。勞民傷財。今已成爲球育勞力世界。若神聖不可侵犯者。亦資本　餘之怪現象耳。一般附屬於資本之下而辦教育者。烏足以知此。以託氏教育法代之。若謂鬥球增長氣力不如託氏用子伐木挑士也。昔衞中（德人）在北方辦學校。學生做鞋泥墻。我以爲此較資本下教育之鬥球爲善矣</p>
<p>二十四日　接劉放一帖。請到蒼磅。Ｓunboon乃劉靑雲爲母七十壽。余藉以遊鄉亦好。夜三時同多人上小輪。每人二元。次日九點到。完全鄉下。有緬人十數家。華人宗族見客至。以鞭砲示歡迎。其開一店。在河邊大樹下。乃茅屋一大間。而客甚多。均乘船至。凡十六桌。到百餘人。茅蓬一壽。費一二千元也。此地華商店數家。均賣雜貨。外面茅屋。而内甚殷實。買賣不小。河邊樹隂。緬女水甚可觀。參觀一緬人小學。一方屋中。甚難形容。以竹爲樓板。板下水泥一女十餘童子。一大者持石版教小者。未見先生。緬人住水泥中。而女子華服妝飾。如上海人也。蓋其不注意於房屋。富亦不潤屋矣。</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>鋒周報　左</h3>
<p>丨二十七至三十期</p>
<p>民族主義文藝運動已爲中國文壇的主潮、而前鋒周報又是這主潮中的淵源、這主潮中最前哨的生力軍、已經成爲永不可泯滅的事實了、的確、稍知中國文壇近况的人、稍與文藝接觸的人、誰不知道有前鋒周報、誰不知道前鋒周報已有相當的成就和聲譽、不過旣已盡人皆知、我爲什麽再來要介紹呢、那完全是因爲該報最近更形完美更形深入的緣故、</p>
<p>我所要介紹的是該報二十七期至三十期、也就是前鋒發刋半年後革新的最初也是最近的四期、以前半年二十六期是李錦軒先生編輯的、他曾以全力致力於文藝的中心意識和理論的建立功夫上、但不幸李先生因病不能繼續負責、因此便由鄭蕭葭先生負責編輯、我要介紹的也便是鄭蕭葭先生編輯後的最完美的、最精彩的物産、</p>
<p>這四期中除兩個孤兒一篇係續前和未完的長篇翻譯小說外、均是短篇的精彩之作、計有較長的論文民族與文藝的關係一篇、短篇創作「希冀」、「寒夜」、「一個安南朋友」、「騎巡兵」等四篇、詩「奴隷的光明」「一行列」、「戰前曲」等三首、批評與談鋒等八篇、每篇較以前都有着顯著的進步、將分别一一加以簡短的介紹、以期使讀者更淸晰、明瞭該報的内容和眞面目、</p>
<p>民族與文藝的關係一文分三節、第一節爲文藝的解剖、由文藝中的三個根本原不、我、我所說的物、我所與言之人來說明文藝的實質、第二節爲在一個民族裏、由文藝要素和民族的關係來闡明民族觀念、第三節爲有所謂階級文藝嗎、以民族的立塲來證明無産階級文藝的缺點和没有存在的可能、全文有統一的觀點和事實的根據、不失爲一篇力作、這我有暇時將在另一文中作更詳細的討論、</p>
<p>四篇短篇創作是在同一的立塲、以民族主義爲中心意識之下寫成的、「希冀」寫的是從南洋歸國的華僑見帝國主義處處侵略而引起的未來的希冀、「寒夜寫的是一個孤單的靑年爲父親復仇、其實也就是爲整個民族奮鬥而犧牲、「一個安南的朋友」寫的是一安南留法學生受法政府偵探的引誘而致墮落的故事、「巡騎兵」寫的是日本在東三省侵略和中國民族的掙扎和奮鬥、每篇有着完整的結構與輕靈的描寫、其中我尤其喜歡「希冀」和「騎巡兵」兩肈、因爲　們給我以比較更深刻的影像、更多的剌㦸、我可以保證、要是誰想找一點興奮、一點新的剌㦸、那末來讀這兩篇短作、一定會得到相當的滿意、</p>
<p>詩「奴隸的光明」是易康送黑人華盛頓回美國而作的、不失値得一讀、「一行列」和「戰前曲」也充滿了爲民族而奮起的呼號、與雄偉和熱烈的情緒、現以篇幅較短的一首一行列錄下吧、在那裏可以找到把民族主義爲中心意識的詩歌的眞諦、</p>
<p>一行列</p>
<p>一行列人在無邊的夜中奪走、</p>
<p>奮勇的前進吧、我們一個個、</p>
<p>這時不是我們休息的時候、</p>
<p>雨在犯打、風在怒吼、</p>
<p>從血泊中救出我們自己、</p>
<p>趁着這時衝上前去、</p>
<p>旗在飄揚、笳在頻催、</p>
<p>一行列人衝破敵人的營壘、</p>
<p>這裏、那裏、殺得他們片甲不回、</p>
<p>踏着這屍首過去吧、</p>
<p>血在飛濺、刀在横飛、</p>
<p>白的曙光、是天明的預兆、</p>
<p>一行列人走過了山頭、</p>
<p>和着萬籟高歌呀、</p>
<p>夜在逃走、雞在破曉、</p>
<p>現在要談到裏面的談鋒了、那不必</p>
<p>過於介紹、也不用如何說明、事實早已證明牠是短小精悍的刃首了、自己說也没有用、請瞧南京文藝月刋的話吧、</p>
<p>「·········時常有些「談鋒」、對於投機的、符咒式的、口號式的文學······加以抨擊、頗有針針見血之效、」</p>
<p>但抱歉得很、不能再以篇幅來引原文作事實上的證明、不過我想讀過該報的人一定能深信不疑的吧、</p>
<p>再有日本反左翼文藝大團結是一篇很好的介紹文、是留心文壇的人誰都應該一讀的、</p>
<p>總之、該報能認淸目標、確立以民族主義爲中心意識的文藝基礎、在混亂的、投機的、盲目的中國文壇裏打一時光明的出路、已很値得我們欽佩和注意了、在現在、新的鬥爭開始的時候、一切都在迅速地改進的時候、使我們更値得而且應該去注意了、所以朋友、請别遲疑吧、前鋒的二十七至三十期你應該去買來一讀、那一定會給你圓滿的結果、</p>

<h3>愛情的結昌四幕劇楊企靜</h3>
<p>熊佛西作</p>
<p>似乎經過許多人都是這樣的說、在藝術之宫中最易激動人們的要算是戲劇、那麽戲劇與人生、戲劇與改造社會之關係的密切、自然就可知道了、然則劇本的選擇、當然的、更爲戲劇運動者首先應當鄭重注意的、</p>
<p>在我們中國、關於劇本的創作、幾年來固然也因爲政局的激蕩、時代的變動、而創作的内容也跟着轉換過幾個方向、不過能夠佔勢力的、還要推時代反映的社會劇、這自然就是因爲戲劇與人生相倚的密切、戲劇與社會進化關係的緊要之故、要知觀衆的興趣、自然是脫不了時代的情緒、最能夠激動他的、當然是他們所立足的現社會事實的描摹和指摘、一些觀衆們的直覺中能夠體味的事實、那纔可以激動他們的内心、而戲劇的價値、亦是爲着時代中社會的需要、想能從其中激發和堅定人們的意志、認淸時代下自己應負的責任、想能此加緊人們的情緒、努力於社會的改造和演進、更想借此燃燒起人們内心的火把、認識人生的眞義、勇往直前大踏步地跨上光明大道、</p>
<p>本文所要介紹的「愛情的結晶」、卽是一個描寫時代社會中一個値得注意的問題的四幕社會劇、全劇劇情的大概是這樣的、劇中的主人翁是陸秋星女士、她時傳統道德　香門第的小姐、她是舊家庭中的新女子、她有一個愛人、名呌陳大鵬、她倆很要好、她倆要好的程度、非單是精神上感情上的十二分融洽、而且在性的方面、也已發生了關係、甚至肚皮也玩大了、這自然是不容於舊傳統道德書香門第的家庭中的、如是的結果、他倆自然是祇好三十六着走爲上着、就跑到另一個地方暫住在旅館裏、那知懷孕八月、就臨盆了、産下一個男囝囝、然而舊社會的環境中、自然是使她倆没有勇氣</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>扶宵這個嬰兒、結果祇好用錢買通旅館裏的侍者、該侍者領回家去養育、非單如此、社會的壓迫人們、往往是會十二分殘忍的、它不特不容這個小孩子在他親生的父母身旁長大、它更不容這一對年少愛情的結晶、而且要與祖國分别、暫時流落到異域去做買賣、幸而他倆在海外所做的買賣都却還順利、過了二十年之久、他倆很撑了一些錢、也就在這時回國、此時他倆很想找回在二十年前忍痛丢棄了的愛情的結晶、他倆固然是仍回到從前所住着生育的大大飯店、而房間雖也是從前住着的那個九十五號房間、但是裏面的事事物物都變了到那裏去尋回二十年前忍痛丢棄的愛情的結晶喲、後來煞費苦心的打探、竟然是探得了一些線索、找到了當年帶領那個小孩子的侍者、可是、這又是社會的惡作劇、踪跡固然是找着了、那知那個愛情的結晶、因爲社會舊傳統觀念的逼迫不能跟着親生的父母、却又被社會認爲是値得卑視的私生子、更加以不斷的侮辱、然而無辜的小孩子、他怎甘忍這種不知所以的侮辱喲、在他忍無可忍的時候、他就反抗了、竟然閙出了人命案、被提將官裏去了、到他的親生的父母來訪問的時候、剛巧他還是關在牢監裏、幸而錢能通神、他父母在南洋撑來的有的是錢、就把這個愛情的結晶贖出來了、但可怪的這個愛情的結晶、那知他曉得了這個事實後、他竟然大呼說旣然這樣、那麽我要這種父母幹嗎、他們不是我的父母、他們决不是我的父母、仍然不願追認這個私生子的雅號、也不顧着富貴和享樂而走開了、其結果終究是没有復回父母的身旁、這就是全劇情節的大概、</p>
<p>其次、請言分幕中的劇情吧、第一幕是本劇主人翁陸秋星女士剛從舊家庭脫離出、寄住在大大飯店中、這時她的腹部凸出、臉色淸瘦、且腹痛時起、以有臨盆徵兆、後飯店聽差走入報告、謂一年約五十歲之姓馮的老者來看她、這可使她急了、她知道這一定是她的父親、父親已親自趕上來了、原來秋星本來是姓馮的、因脫離開家庭、乃更姓爲陸的、這自然使她不願接見、亦無法接見、她祇得始終地咬定牙根說、「你再去告訴他、說九十五號住的是陸小姐、没有什麽馮小姐、把這張名片退還他、說我不認識他　、後來她的肚子劇痛得難過、在這時她不能不出怨言了、她痛得難熬的時候、她竟然怨她的愛人陳大鵬說出這樣的話一我只覺得我自己上了人家的當、人家把我三番四次的騙到這飯店裏來、現在事情急了、他反倒不理我了」、其實她的愛人何常不是如她同樣的着急、不過她自己的苦痛太多了、因之要說出這樣的怨言而已、而第一幕的結束、就是秋星生育了一個男囝囝、一個愛情的結品、</p>
<p>這當然是要一般人傳爲笑談的、無論她倆在結合上是如何底神聖、但這樣愛情的結晶、到底是要被現社會目爲私生子的、所以這個事實也就被報紙認爲是新穎的材料、怎肯不爭先採登、可是這使秋星却更難堪了、所以在第二幕中的情節、秋星就不得不堅决地要離開祖國、到南洋去暫避、也就不得不抛棄了這塊愛情的結晶、給旅館的侍者領了去扶養、在這幕的表情中是如何底悽切心傷喲、</p>
<p>大鵬　秋妹、這是决計使不得的、這是决計使不得的、</p>
<p>這太慘無人道了、你放手吧、你放手吧、</p>
<p>大鵬拉着秋星出幔、</p>
<p>大鵬、（泣）秋妹、你忍心嗎、你忍心把我們的愛情的結晶弄死嗎、你忍心嗎、秋妹、</p>
<p>秋星、（泣）這是没有辦法中最好的辦法、我想出這種辦法來實在是痛上加痛、你想、假如不把他弄死、你又怎麽安置、</p>
<p>大鵬　我們不會把他帶走嗎、</p>
<p>秋星　這是决計辦不到的、他没有名分跟我們走、我們亦没有名分帶他走、</p>
<p>大鵬　他不是我們的兒子嗎、</p>
<p>秋星　是的、他是我們的兒子、是我們不敢承認的兒子、假如現有人到這飯店來問你、這是誰的兒子、你有勇氣回答這是我們的兒子嗎、</p>
<p>看了這幾句的問答、是會怎樣地激蕩人們的内心喲、是自己愛情的結晶、但又没有勇氣承認這是自己的兒子、反說没有名分帶他走、這是如何難堪的情景喲、後來他倆竭盡思慮爲這個嬰兒想了另一個生的出路、就祇好給旅館的侍者領了去扶養、他倆也就此離關了祖國、遠涉重洋、奔赴到南洋去做了二十年的買賣、</p>
<p>第三幕的情節距第二幕情節的時間、已經是二十年了、　時的地點仍在大大飯店、人物和一切的佈置也如舊、惟心情已轉變、色調已沉悶、處處顯出今不是昔今不如昔的景象、陳太太卽二十年前之秋星女士、陳老爺卽當年秋星之愛人陳大鵬先生、她倆都老了、這時她倆始從南洋發了財回來、關於金錢、勢力、安樂、他們都有了、然而只短了愛情的結晶、抛棄了的愛情的結晶、却還没有找回來、這是可以呌她倆悲痛和悔恨的、爲着這事、所以她倆在回國後仍找着這間飯店寄住、竭力地去訪尋她倆當年所忍痛抛棄了的那個愛情的結晶、但費了很多的時日、却還没有找到一些兒綫索、這可夠她倆的着急了、後來幸虧把當年那個帶領愛情的結晶去的旅館的侍者找着了、可是却聞這個愛情的結晶被關在監牢裏、原因是因爲前年有一個呌王開泰的駡他、駡他是私生子、兩人就打起來了、結果王開泰碰在石頭上死了、而這個愛情的結晶、就被抓到監獄裏去、爲的就是私生子的名義、這自然更可使秋星她倆着急的、幸而她倆這時有的是錢、錢能通神、就仗着錢的勢力竭力設法去把這個愛情的結晶弄回來、這就是第三幕中的劇情、</p>
<p>第四幕開幕的時候、秋星她倆都狠高興、尤其是秋星、幾乎高興得要發狂以爲等一忽兒、抛棄了二十年之久的她倆的愛情的結晶、可以復回到她倆的身旁了、他倆就怱忙地購備衣服、準備這個愛情的結晶回來時的更換、那知其結果是出人意料之外的、事與願違、可怪的這個愛情的結晶、在他知道了這個全部的事實後、他不特不肯回復到親生的父母的身旁、而且他更在外大聲地說、「旣然這樣、那麽我要這種父母幹嗎、他們不是我的父母、他們决不是我的父母、」而結果、親生的父母與這個被社會目爲私生子的就成了永遠的隔離、</p>
<p>全劇中的重心、當然就在這個私生子的問題、私生子在社會上應當有怎樣的一個地位、在私生子的本身是否應當被社會所卑視的、這都是値得討論的、而在社會事實上、私生子問題却也佔着相當的嚴重、往往會因私生子的關係、增加社會秩序上的不安、這非單是社會戲劇運動者應當把這個事實指示出來請人們的注意、尤其是社會學專家和執掌社會秩序維持者應當起來注意而設法救濟的、</p>
<p>本劇本非單是取材深劾、在結構上更處處地能引動人們、語調的流露尤爲精刻老練、這當然是作者技巧上的優越和成功、</p>

<p>文西（Ｌeonardo　Da　Vinei　14S2159）有名的「莫娜麗薩」的盜案、是關係國際的、犯人是個意大利的靑年爲了這畫、吃盡了千辛萬苦、才在於一千九百十一年夏某日白畫上、從巴黎的盧佛爾博物館盜出來的、這事經兩年之久、到千九百十三年冬、爲一佛羅蘭市的畫商所發見、陳情於法蘭西政府、一塲騷動天下的「英娜麗薩」盜竊案、乃告平息、</p>
<p>盜畫的那少年、决不是生成的一個盜賊、也不是如上所述的變態性慾行爲的色中餓鬼、他是一個意大利累世名門的子弟、他也不是驟見這畫就乘興盜出來的、他盜畫的動機、很久很久以前、便在那顆充湧着愛國熱的心理前動着了、但是、像盧佛期博物館那樣監視森嚴的地方、怎樣能下得手把那高貴的名畫偷出來呢、爲了這問題、他幾乎連寢食也都忘掉了、</p>
<p>終於、他鬱鬱地抱志離開他的祖國意大利、</p>
<p>他到了巴黎、馬上就看他祖國巨匠的名畫「英娜麗薩」去、他好幾次要下手、但苦不得一個安全的方法、於是、他失望了、</p>
<p>有一天、他看見博物館中「英娜麗薩」的陳列室、壁上的裝飾像要更改了的樣子、他知道、改換裝飾的那一天、這裏的一室、是要臨時謝絶參觀的、他又知道、在這一室裏的名畫、要一幅幅地取下來、等到完了裝飾之後、再一幅幅地照着原定的位置掛上去、</p>
<p>旣然外部的人、絶對不能入内、那末盜畫的方法也是絶望了的、他想到這一點、不禁悵惱起來了、最後、他的腦海裏忽然湧上這個妙策、（還是謀當了一名室内裝飾的夫役去吧、誠然、除此以外、再没有另外一個可以自由出入盧佛爾博物館的方法了···」</p>
<p>這個年靑的外國人、苦心慘憺地跑到盧佛爾博物館特定的裝飾店去求職了、結果、他的目的達到了、他被雇爲盧佛爾博物館裝飾的夫役了、</p>
<p>到了那一天丨他期待的那一天、他所感覺的快樂、是非筆墨所能形容的、他工作着、努力地工作着、</p>
<p>午飯的時間到了、夥伴們催他吃午飯去、他不理、夥伴們惱了駡他、他也不理、等到、他看見監視人離開他的時候、機警地、立刻停止了工作、在腰間摸出一把銳利的小刀來、把他那幅從小就知道</p>
<p>了的「莫娜麗薩」名畫、由鏡架上割下來、卷一卷、一溜烟逃到外面去、</p>
<p>估價在兩三百萬元以上的、不、超越金錢以上的遼那德達芬奇的（莫娜麗薩）底失竊事件的發生、法蘭西政府對之這個事件、有如大總統行方不明的問題以上那樣的嚴重、頓時、全國佈下警察網、四處搜索犯人、尤其注意於國境的邊防、很嚴密地張起警戒網來、</p>
<p>然而、這個天眞純潔的靑年、丨由愛國動機、挺而走險的靑年丨畢竟、天憫其誠、得漏出了水洩不通的危險警戒網、挾着價値連城的祖國名畫、逃回故鄉佛羅蘭市來、</p>
<p>他的目的達到了、他的宿願已債了、</p>
<p>但他並不怎樣去慶賀自已的勝利、分明、這事情也閙得太厲害了、他眼見搜索無着的人們的頽喪、惱恨、歎息的情景、不禁良心起了苟責、他决定、有了機會便要硬着頭皮出來自首的、</p>
<p>「莫娜麗薩」雖然不能陳列在自已國有的美術館裏、可是、旅居在法蘭西的意大利僑民、也同樣地享有玩賞本國名畫的權利的……「英娜麗薩」一定落在意大利的什麽地方的……希望傾以全力、把這名畫尋出來丨這是佛羅蘭市的畫商們、受法蘭西政府委託的一段話、後來、那少年的行踪、就給一個佛羅蘭市著名的畫商探悉了、會商的結果、他要求那少年把「莫娜麗薩」交還法國、而自已則以担保少年生命之安全爲條件、</p>
<p>自此以後、世界美術愛好家、深不能埀涎的名畫「莫娜麗薩」又高高地掛在盧佛爾博物館了、</p>

<h3>一個劫營的消息　珂</h3>
<p>我正迷曚在一個縹緲的境界裏、陡然地神經一震、耳膜裏似乎有「珂」的餘音在裊動着「是周在喊我吧、」我立時恢復了記憶力、睜開眼晴向對床望去、在門外透進來的稀微的燈光裏、看見她把棉被絮緊緊地蒙着頭、一點聲息也没有、「見鬼、大概是我做夢吧、也許是聽錯了、」我依舊朦朧地再想睡去了、這時、樓下忽起了一陣嘈雜的喧閙聲、又像在操塲上、「我們的人捉去了吧、没有、没有一」雖然不能十分清晰地聽到、但這種强有力的問答、夾在紛　的聲浪中、是可以辨别出來的、</p>
<p>我不由地有些害怕起來、一個恐佈的印象立時憧憬在我的面前、那是雖只像一個小小的浪花卽時平靜、被誣的馬上釋放出來丨但當時的大家心裏、却着實的替那被誣的危險、現在、同樣地是在一個夜晚、一切的都同樣、不要又在重演那套把戲吧、我恐怖得快要抖顫、同時、聽見周也在床上輾動、</p>
<p>「周、你聽見嗎、」</p>
<p>「我早就醒了、呌了你好幾句不見你答應、現在你也被吵醒了嗎、」她也和我一樣的害怕、</p>
<p>喧閙了很久、才慢慢地人聲寂靜下來、接着聽見下面的房門關閉聲、悄悄地再不聽見什麽聲響了、我們才帶着這疑懼的印象、重復回到悠適的夢境去、</p>
<p>第二天、天一亮我就起來了、爲着要解辯夜晚的疑問、跑下三樓、祇見好們聚了一大堆、在議論晚上的事、</p>
<p>「密司顧、昨天晚上爲着什麽吵得那樣厲害、」我找着一個熟的同學問、</p>
<p>「聽說是檢查男同學的宿舍、我們聽見捉、捉、捉、的嚷着、誰也不敢起來、」我再走進一羣的當中聽聽、也是這樣地說着、</p>
<p>洗臉的時候、幾個娘姨在談笑着、「我們學校裏的男先生們、昨天裝扮着拉黄包車的和賣小吃的、到那橋頭扎着的男兵女兵的營房裏偷東西、被他們曉得了、一直追到學校裏來捉人、」</p>
<p>啊、怪道昨天下午有一個我認得的男先生、臉上塗抺着穢汚、身上穿了油漬的圍裙、手裏拾着竹籃、裏面裝滿了梨香蕉、柿子、光着一雙帶泥的脚、走來問我像不像一個賣小吃的人、經他這一問、我才認識出來、否則、發誓我也不會知道他是本校的學生、」</p>
<p>這一段談話、眞使我墮入五里霧中、噹、噹、噹、上課的鐘聲迫我不能再聽下去、</p>
<p>我經過操塲、遠遠地看見草地上架着一個童了軍露宿的蓬帳和一面旗子、隨風飄颺着、四周圍了許多許多的人、我因時間的關係、怱怱地走過去、</p>
<p>下課後、我走到學生佈告處、一張很大的新貼的白紙佈告赫然地呈現在我的眼簾、</p>
<p>哦、「一個劫營的戰訊」於是我一行行地看下去、原來、原來在往吳淞鎭的一條小路上的一塊草地上、兩江體專、中國體專、蘇州中山體專、三校的童子軍在那里露營、本校的同學們、爲求實地練習軍事訓練的機會起見、所以先期下戰書通知他們、擬在那日晚上去劫營、後來得到敵方允許、臨時派了兩個偵探扮作小販和拉車的去察看敵營、到下午八點鐘出發、分三路進襲、在黑暗的不平的石子路上、爬行前進、有的刺破了手臉的、有的</p>
<h3>運動員（氷攝）</h3>
<p>撕破了衣服的、然而他們不因此餧氣、依然鼓勇進攻丨是役雖則只去了五十餘人、但因調度有方與軍士用命、結果是奏凱而歸、操塲上的帳蓬、旗子、就是他們的戰勝俘虜品、</p>
<p>玩、祇是閙着玩丨但、我以爲這是有意義的、在我們意志頽唐的民族現狀下、他們能不怕艱辛、在黑暗的境界裏、喊呐、搏戰、驚醒了我們的迷夢、雖然、祇是玩、這勇敢確是値得我們欽佩的、</p>

<h3>Naval Competition Among the Powers</h3>
<p>US Navy Funding Bill Passes Senate</p>
<p>Important Developments in Naval Policy to Occur</p>
<p>Britain and France Agree on Compromise Draft for Tonnage</p>
<p>France Still Insists on Superiority in Ship Tonnage Compared to Italy</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 21st—The Senate has passed the Navy funding bill, amounting to 338 million US dollars. Since the House of Representatives passed the bill, an additional 10 million dollars have been added. This money will be used to build 11 destroyers. After the recent large-scale defense trial experiments by the US Navy in the Panama Canal Zone, US naval policy seems to be undergoing important developments. It is believed that having a powerful air force, based on nimble aircraft carriers, can allow attacking, strong battleships and cruisers to be destroyed to a large extent before reaching their attack targets. Therefore, the Navy Department seems to be allocating a large portion of the designated 73,000 tons of cruisers to build cruisers with aircraft landing decks.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Tide in South America</h3>
<p>Previously, when South American countries experienced revolutionary turmoil, I stated that the reason for the revolutions was economic difficulty, not politics. Because of economic difficulties within the country, resentment was directed towards the government, and the desire was to change the government through revolution to alleviate economic difficulties. However, the economic difficulties of these countries this time are due to the widespread global commercial recession and not due to the mismanagement of one country. Therefore, after the revolution, there will be no improvement in the economy of the people, and popular dissatisfaction will remain. If the revolutionary government remains in power, subsequent revolutions will continue to occur. This is an unavoidable situation. Now, news of instability in various South American countries has resurfaced, such as the coup in Peru and the activities of the Communist Party in Paraguay.</p>
<p>In South American countries as such, political parties in Europe and America are also as such. After economic difficulties, commercial recession, and increased unemployment, the government is attacked and overthrown, and those who take power in its place are inevitably attacked by the opposition party and subsequently overthrown. Why? Today, the world's economic problems cannot be shifted by the power of one country or one party. Therefore, those who attack others' shields with this spear today will inevitably have others attack their skin with that spear in the future.</p>
<p>Continuing Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 21st—It is reported that after discussions between British Foreign Office Commissioner Craige and representatives from the French Foreign Office and Navy Department, a compromise plan for naval tonnage has been agreed upon. It is widely believed that this plan will cause significant changes in the French naval program. It is reported that Craige has agreed to France reducing tonnage, especially the tonnage of submarines, but France is now requesting an increase in its cruisers as compensation. Craige has also been able to persuade France to limit its naval superiority over Italy to 150,000 tons until 1936. This is an important step towards harmony, as France requested 240,000 tons more at the London Conference. Craige is now submitting this plan to the British naval authorities for consideration.</p>
<h3>Close Friends Turn Into Enemies</h3>
<p>Motive for Assassinating the King of Albania</p>
<p>Due to Unwillingness to Accept the Shackles of the Puppet Party</p>
<p>Confessions of the Arrested Criminals</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Vienna, 21st—One of those who assassinated the King of Albania last night, named Aziz Qami, was once one of the King's closest friends. It is reported that because the King seized national power, their friendship turned into enmity.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Vienna, 21st—The Austrian police strictly interrogated the two murderers of the King of Albania, Qami and Chironi, overnight. They consistently claimed that it was out of personal grievances. This morning, after further strict interrogation, they revealed the truth: The Albanian Revolutionary Party was angry at the King's willingness to accept the shackles of the Puppet Party, causing Albania to completely lose its independence and being drawn into the disputes between Italy and Yugoslavia. Therefore, they sent two people to assassinate him. This assassination plan was decided on Thursday in a certain tavern in Vienna. Both are 　Albanian military officers. According to the confession, the police searched all Albanian residences in the Austrian capital this afternoon and obtained sixteen more people, believed to be related to the case. As for those who were shot during the assassination, one was the deputy adjutant to the King, Du Batai, who died immediately, and the other was the Minister of the Palace, Li Pihefa, whose injuries are serious but expected to recover. After the incident, the Austrian Foreign Minister rushed to the hotel where the King was staying overnight to convey the condolences of the Austrian government, and the Austrian people also gathered in front of the hotel to inquire about the news.</p>

<p>▲National News Agency, Rome, 21st—　The news of the assassination of the King of Albania greatly shocked political circles in Italy. It is expected that this move will cause diplomatic repercussions, and it is believed to be a reactionary act by the Albanian Revolutionary Party. They are sheltered in Yugoslavia, and the South is also assisting them because of their anti-Italian tendencies. It is claimed that evidence has already been obtained that they will soon attack the Albanian border in an attempt to launch an uprising.</p>
<h3>International Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to the Silver Crisis</h3>
<p>Urges Member States to Consider the Issue Soon</p>
<p>Britain and France Negotiate Financial Cooperation</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 21st—The Executive Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce now advocates that the international community immediately consider the silver issue. Zhang Jia'ao, General Manager of the Bank of China, recently telegraphed the International Chamber of Commerce, requesting attention to the continued decline in silver prices, which has a serious impact on China's foreign trade. He stated that the plan to reorganize foreign goods is greatly disrupted by the decline in silver prices and that an international conference should consider this issue as soon as possible. Mr. Meya, Chairman of the British-Chinese Corporation, spoke on behalf of the China Association, greatly approving of Mr. Zhang's proposal. He said that the heads of London banks related to trade with China believe that the rapid consideration of remedial measures is not only very appropriate but also feasible. The Executive Committee then passed a resolution requesting the national committees and members of the International Chamber of Commerce to urge their governments to consult with China and other governments to consider the silver issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 21st—Representatives from the British and French Ministries of Finance have now begun talks. The content is unknown, but according to unofficial sources, the scope of the talks includes close cooperation between Britain and France on currency policy, exchange rates, cash flow, and loans.</p>
<h3>Movement to Reorganize the Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>Gradually Taking Concrete Form</p>
<p>The Old Issue of Slander Is Brought Up Again</p>
<p>The Government Authorities Are in Dire Straits</p>
<p>▲Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd—The movement to reorganize the party, launched by the Miki Bukichi faction, is gradually gaining importance due to the joint support of the Nakano Seigo faction. The report and resolution on the movement to reorganize the cabinet at the meeting of the Kanto Diet members of the party on the evening of the 21st can be said to be the first step in the concretization of the movement. Also, Yoshida, Fukushima, and others will convene a meeting at the Tokyo Kaikan on the 23rd, with more than sixty people attending to discuss the reorganization issue. In the afternoon, a meeting of the initiators will be held to plan the cabinet reform and decide to formulate a new policy and announce it to the world after the end of the parliament. It is said that the mastermind behind this reorganization movement is the Koizumi Sakutaro faction.</p>
<p>▲Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd—Mr. Hanai of the Kouyu Club asked about the responsibility of the Minister of State at yesterday's Budget Committee of the Upper House. The question was already raised after his speech and cannot be exempted by cancellation. How does Prime Minister Hara feel about the responsibility of the advisors for the slander? Did the interruption of the House of Representatives and the bloody tragedy cause him to feel responsible? Because of this question, the slander issue seems to be raised again among the members of the Upper and Lower Houses.</p>
<p>▲Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd—The Japanese government is in dire straits due to Dr. Hanai's questions. Therefore, at last night's emergency cabinet meeting, it was decided to reply to the Upper House that the slander by Acting Prime Minister Hihara was not purely slander but merely insufficient wording, causing misunderstanding. Therefore, there is no need to take responsibility. However, the Seiyukai Party is greatly angered by this, because the government had previously admitted to the slander and cancelled it, but now it is retracting it and using the excuse of insufficient wording. The Upper House also criticized the government for its inconsistency.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>From Ji'ning: To all newspaper offices: I, Sun Lianyang, have received the commission from the Commander-in-Chief, appointing me as the Director of Clearing and Pacification of Jiangxi Province. Feeling unworthy of this important task, I fear that my limited abilities may lead to failure. At this time of national crisis and rampant banditry in Jiangxi, if I were to consider only my own interests, remain silent, and decline the appointment, it would prolong the suffering of the entire province. Therefore, on February 21st, I respectfully assumed office in Ji'ning, vowing to follow the example of my predecessors in Jiangxi and to strive together to suppress the bandits. I hope that the enlightened people within the country and friendly parties from all sides will not forget those who are far away, and will provide guidance. I am extremely grateful and hopeful. I, Sun Lianyang, bow in respect.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Exiles Naturalized Germans to Our Territory</h3>
<p>▲ The First Group of Over Two Hundred People Has Arrived in Harbin</p>
<p>▲ The Second Group of Over Three Hundred is En Route</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Two hundred and twelve Germans, men and women, who had naturalized in Russia, entered our territory on the 16th of this month from Soviet Russia. Escorted by personnel dispatched by the Heihe Garrison Headquarters, they were sent to the capital of Heilongjiang Province. After a thorough inspection by the commissioners of the Heilongjiang National Defense Preparatory Office, proving that there were no dangerous elements among them, they were sent to Ang'angxi Station on the 15th of this month. The East Railway Company allocated five freight cars, attached to the rear of Train No. 92, to transport them to Harbin. The Germans included 52 men, 64 women, 49 boys, and 47 girls. Upon disembarking, under the supervision of the military police, they were taken by the White Russian Emigrant Relief Association in Harbin and distributed to various Russian churches for temporary residence. These Germans originally lived in the coastal regions of Russia, engaging in farming and cultivation. They had lived in Russia for a hundred years, having acquired citizenship during the Tsarist era. Their population had grown to several thousand. They had formed a distinct community within the coastal region. After the fall of the Tsarist regime, the Soviet government harbored as much antipathy towards these non-purely White Russian people as it did towards the White Russians themselves. Initially, the entire community was relocated in batches, some to Sakhalin Island, others to Siberia. Each batch of adult men numbered no more than sixty or seventy, with the intention of preventing them from congregating in large numbers and plotting rebellion against the Soviet government. However, after the relocation in batches, the Soviet government still feared that they might leak Soviet secrets to the outside world, so they remained uneasy. At first, they planned to send them out of Russia, back to Prussia, but Germany was not very agreeable, so they changed their plan and had them drift to our country. The Chairman of Heilongjiang, Wan Fulin, received a report from the Heihe Consul at the beginning of this month, considering the matter to be important and not daring to agree rashly. He telegraphed to the Northeast Supreme Authorities for instructions. The Harbin Russian Emigrant Relief Association and the Catholic Church Bishop also jointly petitioned the Northeast government, requesting permission for the Germans to enter the country to seek a livelihood and guaranteeing that they would not endanger the local area or affect politics. The Northeast Political Affairs Committee held a meeting to discuss this, believing that the number of people was not large and that if surveillance was slightly tighter, no accidents would occur. Therefore, they telegraphed Wan Fulin and Zhang Jinghui to inform them, and the Germans were then allowed to enter our territory. It is heard that the second batch of Germans, numbering about three hundred, are already en route and may enter the country through Manzhouli by the end of this month. (16th)</p>
<h3>The Reality of the Spread of Narcotics in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>▲ Golden Pill Noodle History</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Shanxi, in ancient times, was known as the strongest in the world. More recently, it has become known as "helpless." At present, it has become a place where the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, unable to find a way out. What is the reason for this? Tracing back to the causes:</p>
<p>Firstly, it is due to the impact of military affairs, with excessive supplies. Secondly, it is due to the suspension of exchange of provincial banknotes, causing financial panic. Thirdly, it is due to the stagnation of transportation, leading to the cessation of trade. However, these three are still tangible factors, while the only fatal injury is the invisible killer such as golden pills, prepared noodles, and machine-made bubbles. The annual loss of money in the entire province is no less than thirty to fifty million. The raw materials for these items all come from Tianjin and Shanghai. Recently, many places in the interior of Shanxi Province and at the border with Henan and Hebei, such as Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, Qinghua, and Guanyintang, have also started manufacturing them. The raw materials are purely a mixture of morphine, lactose, heroin, etc., which is the sole patented business of Japanese merchants and drifters in Shanxi. The initial import was as early as the second or third year of the Republic of China. At that time, there was only one type of yellow golden pill, which was mostly sold publicly by pharmacies, under the name of "good medicine for quitting opium." It was said that it could stop opium addiction by taking it. At that time, Shanxi was in a period of strict opium prohibition, so the government not only did not prohibit it but also promoted it, unexpectedly causing a small trickle to become a large river, causing harm to this extreme. Before the seventh year of the Republic of China, it was not yet popular. Each small bottle of twenty-five pills only sold for twenty or thirty copper coins. At that time, users only swallowed them. After the seventh year of the Republic of China, it was discovered that it could be smoked in the same way as opium. Therefore, more and more people used it, and sales became more and more smooth. Because it could replace opium, and the price was cheaper than opium, it gradually spread, almost to half of southern Shanxi. Once addicted to it, it was impossible to quit. Then, as demand exceeded supply, the price continued to rise. Until recently, in the most expensive period, only eight pills could be purchased for one silver dollar. Even in normal times, it was no more than twenty or thirty pills. The types of golden pills initially only included yellow, followed by red, white, and other types. Although the shapes are similar, the quality is actually different. Ordinary smokers take it at least three times a day, with thirty to fifty pills each time. It is not uncommon to take two or three hundred pills each time. This is only in terms of golden pills. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, it became more and more bizarre. Following the golden pills, there were prepared noodles and machine-made bubbles. Prepared noodles are further divided into coarse noodles, fine noodles, and two-fine noodles. Coarse noodles contain more lactose, fine noodles contain more morphine and heroin, etc., and two-fine noodles are a mixture of the two. Machine-made bubbles are made by mixing the mixture into a viscous substance and using a machine to make them into the shape of opium bubbles, in order to make it easy to smoke and avoid the trouble of mixing and burning for the smoker. Fine prepared noodles are purchased in Tianjin and Shanghai for about 900 silver dollars per pound. When transported to Shanxi Province, they can currently be sold for 1,600 silver dollars. Ordinary retail sells for sixteen or seventeen silver dollars per cash, and the high value exceeds gold. No wonder the annual leakage in Shanxi Province reaches thirty to fifty million. The method of smoking is that golden pills and machine-made bubbles are both smoked with smoking utensils, like eating opium. Prepared noodles can also be used with smoking utensils, but ordinary smokers put them in cigarettes and smoke them while smoking. After this method became popular, the toxin of prepared noodles became even more potent. Because it can be smoked during rest, and it can also be smoked during work, in other words, it can be smoked almost anytime, anywhere. Because the smoking method is simple, the scope of smokers has also become wider and wider, especially among military soldiers and young students. Pingtai in the middle, Luzhou and Zezhou in the east, and Pujiang in the south are the most popular. Broadly speaking, the entire province is permeated by this toxic gas. In many places, this drug is even used as a precious item for ordinary socializing. People with severe addiction, in addition to smoking in cigarettes, also put a large amount of prepared noodles on the table and sniff them directly with their noses, or even smoke them with their eyes. In short, the only purpose is to make it intensely stimulate the blood. In fact, the deep-rooted disease has entered the marrow, and the death date can be predicted. Initial smokers become addicted after smoking for two or three days. If addicted, it is extremely rare to smoke one or two yuan a day. Usually, it requires three to five yuan, or even twenty to thirty yuan, which is not surprising. No wonder the people of Shanxi have often had families with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of huge assets, which are all gone in a few years. Once addicted, the smoker's face becomes yellow and colorless. According to experienced people, three years after a severe addiction, even if not fatal, they become disabled. It is said that if this continues, after a hundred years, the people of Shanxi will be extinct. Alas, this statement is painful. The main routes for importing this item into Shanxi Province are the Zhengtai Railway, Dongyang Pass, Qinghua, and Guanyintang. The situation in Qinghua Xinzhuang has been recorded in previous newspapers. The situation of import in Zhengtai Dongyang Guanyintang will be investigated and continued.</p>
<h3>The Experience of Yushan Being Raided by the Fang Bandits</h3>
<p>▲ Zhao Weigong Kills Over a Thousand Bandits</p>
<p>Changshan Dispatch: The Fang Zhimin bandits in eastern Jiangxi, entrenched in Mopan Mountain, have successively raided Shangrao, Yiyang, Hengfeng, and other counties. Recently, due to the encirclement and suppression by the 55th Division, the 4th Division, and the Zhejiang Army Training Regiment in Jiangxi, the bandits have poured out their nests and fled east, approaching the Zhejiang border. Ye Wen, the magistrate of Changshan County, sent scouts to investigate the bandit situation and telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the 4th Division stationed in Hangzhou to send troops to aid. However, before the reinforcements arrived, the bandits took advantage of the gap and raided the territory of Yushan County, capturing Linhujiang in Yushan on February 3rd (50 miles from Yushan City). After receiving the report, Zhao Junmai, the commander of the training regiment, personally led a special service company and a cavalry platoon on the evening of the 5th to rush to the defense. Fearing encirclement, the Fang bandits retreated to the Bingxuipu Niutouling area (80 miles from Yushan City). It was then discovered that the military strength of Yushan City was weak. On the night of the 7th, they captured Linhujiang again and raided Fangtou (40 miles from Yushan City). Zhao Bei</p>
<p>Commander Li sent the Ninth Company and the cavalry platoon to guard Wumu Mountain (25 miles from Yushan City). At the end of the 8th, the Fang bandits swarmed to attack, and the guards retreated. Regiment Commander Zhao sent a special service company to advance and assist in the battle, meeting the enemy at Shilishan (10 miles from Yushan City). Again, because of the disparity in numbers, the companies and platoons all retreated to Zhejiang. On this day, Magistrate Ye of Changshan responded to Regiment Commander Zhao's invitation and went to the Yushan Regiment Headquarters to discuss defense. Suddenly, gunshots were heard in the city, and they risked breaking through the encirclement. Regiment Commander Zhao only led a few orderlies and broke out to the west. At about 5 o'clock, Yushan City fell, and traffic between Changshan and Yushan was cut off. Many Yushan residents fled to Changshan on foot to seek refuge. Magistrate Ye rushed back to Changshan overnight and telegraphed for reinforcements. He also joined the Deputy Officer Zhao and the light artillery company left behind in the regiment and led the team to the Zhejiang border on the morning of the 9th to defend the border. Regiment Commander Zhao also rushed to Shaxi in western Yushan and transferred the 123rd Battalion stationed in Shangrao, organizing a daredevil team to counterattack. From that morning, after several hours of fierce fighting, the bandits began to collapse to the north. At 4 p.m., Yushan City was recaptured. In this battle, one pseudo-staff chief and one pseudo-regiment commander were killed, and over a thousand bandits were killed. Over thirty rifles were seized. Regiment Commander Zhao of the Zhejiang Army was also slightly injured, and about a hundred soldiers were killed or wounded. Currently, Zhao's regiment is guarding the Zhejiang border, and the Zhejiang defense is extremely solid. (17th)</p>
<h3>Poppy Fields Everywhere in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>▲ Prohibition Committee Headquarters Issues a Notice of Prohibition</p>
<p>The Central Opium Prohibition Committee, in view of the fact that poppy seedlings have been found in Nan'an, Hui'an, Changtai, Zhao'an, and Zhangpu counties in Fujian Province, and that opium poppies are planted everywhere along the roads of Quanzhou and Anxi, a sight unseen in the past three years, yesterday convened a meeting with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Military Affairs to issue a notice of prohibition. The notice stated: "To prohibit opium, one must first prohibit planting. If planting is not prohibited, the source will not be cut off. If the source is not cut off, prohibiting transportation, sale, and smoking, no matter how much effort is expended, will ultimately be futile. This headquarters deeply understands that opium has been a disaster for a hundred years. Its harm, on a small scale, injures the body, and on a large scale, destroys the country and exterminates the race. The harm is even greater than floods and fierce beasts. We hope that the people of the whole country will be deeply vigilant and work together to eliminate it. However, according to investigations, poppy seedlings have been found in Nan'an, Hui'an, Changtai, Zhao'an, Zhangpu, Xianyou, and Jinjiang counties in southern Fujian Province, and opium poppies are planted everywhere along the roads of Quanzhou and Anxi, a sight unseen in the past three years. Ignorant and foolish people, in order to greedily seek immediate gains, are not afraid to break the law, poisoning people, which is painful to say. This headquarters cannot bear to punish without teaching, so we have issued this notice, earnestly explaining that anyone who privately plants poppies should thoroughly realize their mistake and eliminate them voluntarily. If they remain unrepentant, or if there are local gentry and unscrupulous military personnel who actually shelter planting, once discovered, they will be punished according to the law and will not be lenient in the slightest. Do not say that you were not warned. Let each of you respectfully comply and not violate this decree."</p>
<h3>Business Tax in Fujian Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>General Chamber of Commerce Advocates Tax Assessment by Association</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The business tax in Fujian Province, all tax rates and collection regulations, have been submitted by the Finance Department to the Provincial Government for approval and implementation. The business tax bureaus of various counties have also been sending personnel to establish them one after another. The Finance Department ordered the tax bureaus of various counties to calculate all taxable standards according to the annual business tax regulations. It is now stipulated that all business firms established before the promulgation of the business tax regulations in this province shall be collected monthly from January of this year according to the assessed amount of tax payable for the whole year. The business firms newly established shall be collected monthly from the date of opening, so as to ensure fairness. However, the various business associations in Fuzhou believe that the business tax rate set by the Finance Department exceeds the national outline by many times. They have been discussing solutions at the General Chamber of Commerce for days, arguing that the original businesses already bear donations and taxes, or that the association has already handled special taxes, or that the customs has already implemented new taxes, and have many objections to the business tax. The directors of the General Chamber of Commerce also believe that if the regulations are followed, it is necessary to investigate the business numbers of each merchant and then levy taxes according to the amount. The procedures are cumbersome and they fear that it will cause harassment, deeply fearing that it will still follow the drawbacks of the Likin tax era. Therefore, they negotiated with the financial authorities to assess the tax amount by association, and then distribute it to each firm within the association, so that both the government and the merchants can obtain convenience. It is heard that the Finance Department has already agreed. (February 19th)</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of Bandit Suppression in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>▲ He Long's Remaining Bandits Have Been Heavily Encircled</p>
<p>▲ Bandit Generals in Northern and Southern Hubei Are About to Disappear</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The military operation to suppress bandits in Hubei Province has been making progress since the Wuhan Headquarters ordered a general offensive from all routes. In western Hubei, He Long's remaining troops have been surrounded. In southern and northern Hubei, there have also been considerable victories. In eastern Hubei, the bandits have been cleared and the clearing of the countryside is underway. The situation in each area is described below:</p>
<p>▲ Western Hubei: The He Long bandit forces, who have long been a source of worry in the border area of Hunan and Hubei, after fleeing from Hunan to Hubei, successively captured Gong'an, Hefeng, and Wufeng counties. Later, they were surrounded and suppressed by various armies, and fled back to western Hunan. They were blocked and suppressed by Li Jue's division of the 4th Route Army, and their momentum was frustrated. They then fled back to their old nest in Hefeng. After receiving the report, the Wuhan Headquarters immediately ordered the 4th and 7th Route Armies and Xu Yuanquan's troops to encircle them from all sides. The two brigades of Liu Peixu and Li Guizhou and Luo Qijiang's brigade have advanced towards the Shihe area. The 4th Route Army is also tracking and pursuing from western Hunan. Director He of the Headquarters, in order to completely annihilate the He bandits, has telegraphed He Jian, ordering Li Yue to pursue them relentlessly. Also, Li Jue, the commander of the 19th Division, telegraphed yesterday reporting the defeat of the He bandits. According to reconnaissance reports, He Long's bandit forces were found in Guaziyu near Shimen. He immediately led his troops to suppress them, engaging in a fierce battle at Taizipo for a day and a night. The bandit forces were defeated and retreated to Mogang to resist stubbornly. He immediately ordered a fierce attack, fighting fiercely for two days and two nights. The bandits suffered thousands of casualties, over eight hundred were captured, over five hundred rifles and countless horses were seized. The bandits fled to Hefeng, and teams are being sent to track and pursue them. At the same time, he telegraphed to friendly armies in Sichuan and Hubei to encircle them, striving to annihilate the old nest of the Zoumaping bandits.</p>
<p>▲ Northern Hubei: In northern Hubei, after the severe suppression by Fan Shisheng's 51st Division, the Cao Bi bandit forces have been cleared. However, there are still a few bandits harassing the Suizao area. That area is the defense area of the 44th Division's artillery regiment and cavalry regiment. After their vigorous suppression, many bandits were captured. The division commander of the division, Xiao Zhichu, telegraphed the headquarters yesterday to report the victory, stating, "To Commander He of the Headquarters: According to the telegram from Hao Qi, the artillery regiment commander of my division in Sui County, he received a letter from Song, the cavalry regiment commander, stating that the communist bandits in the Xihe area have retreated to Zhoujiafan and Zhenwu recaptured that area. The bandits fled to Wu Jiaji, Xinji, and Song Jiaji, which belong to Zao County. I immediately led the team to suppress them. In Zhenyou, Wu Jiaji was occupied, dozens of bandits were killed, several were captured, and dozens of knives and spears were seized. The communist bandits in Song Jiaji numbered about four to five thousand, relying on the mountains for danger. My regiment was isolated and without friendly army assistance. However, due to the plea of the people, I made a desperate plan and set off on the morning of the first day of the month, using a part of the force to contain the bandits in Xinji. I led the team to launch a full attack. The bandits resisted unusually stubbornly. Fortunately, my officers and soldiers bravely climbed the mountain and recaptured Song Jiaji in the afternoon of the first day of the month, killing over a hundred bandits, capturing over ten, and seizing several rifles, knives, spears, flags, and the seal of the Soviet Government Propaganda Department, etc. My soldiers were also wounded five or six. My regiment is without assistance and fifty miles away from Sui County, which I feel is difficult. I will first return to Zhoujiaji to investigate the communist bandits and appease the people. Please report this matter to the superiors."</p>
<p>▲ Southern Hubei: In southern Hubei, the communist bandits were most rampant in Yangxin and Daye. The Headquarters tasked Guo Rudong's 26th Division to be responsible for the suppression, and they have already destroyed the Longgang bandit nest and are now advancing towards Sanxikou to suppress them. The division commander of the division, Guo Rudong, came to Hankou yesterday to report everything to the headquarters in person and, together with Deputy Division Commander Wang Jingcheng, telegraphed to report the victory, stating: "I, your subordinate, reported on the fish noon the situation of Liu Brigade's destruction of the Longgang bandit nest in two days. Recently, Brigade Commander Liu reported in the fish morning that because the Red Army fled to Sanxikou on the Jiang Day, he returned the division from Longgang to Xintanpu. I received your order to suppress Sanxikou and was about to set out when I received Hao Division's Sixth Regiment, which arrived at Longgang, and Deputy Officer Tian and Regiment Adjutant Ma were sent by Brigade Commander Li and Regiment Commander Liu to contact my office and agree to suppress Yushan in Yanxia. I discussed and decided that I would send the Fourth Regiment to Zhujia Mountain to Gaotan on the morning of the first day of the month and advance to Yushan in the morning. The Liu Regiment of Hao Division will arrive at Yanxia from Longgang on the first day of the month and advance to Shang Yushan through Hupankou in the morning. The Fourth Regiment of my brigade set out on time. At this moment, the leading Yang battalion has returned to Bantanpu from Yushan. According to reports, the regiment arrived at Gaotan on the day and encountered a large number of Red Army fleeing from Yanxia. They were immediately defeated, killing over a hundred bandits and injuring many. Among the bodies of the Red bandits, there was a commander. Over twenty people were captured alive and over ten rifles were seized. They advanced to Yushan in the morning to join the Hao Division in attacking the bandits in Yushan, and then returned to Xintanpu. I ordered the brigade commander to quickly lead the Third and Fourth Regiments to advance to Sanxikou Taipingtang and ordered Bai Regiment to search and suppress Da and Xiao Jipu from Daye County. I respectfully report this matter."</p>
<p>▲ Eastern Hubei: After the bandits from the border of Henan and Anhui invaded Macheng with a crowd of 30,000 and were defeated by the troops of the 13th Division, eastern Hubei was relatively peaceful. However, there were a few communist bandits harassing everywhere. The Wuhan Headquarters, considering that the area is adjacent to Henan and Anhui, specially tasked Li Mingzhong, the Pacification Director of the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei border area, to send teams to suppress them. Li has ordered Xia Douyin, Fan Xiji, Ji Hongchang, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, and Pan Shanzhai's divisions and brigades to be stationed in Huangma and other counties to engage in suppression and, in counties without bandits, to cooperate with local county magistrates and militia to clear the countryside. In summary, there are more than five divisions and one brigade responsible for the pacification of eastern Hubei. The bandit troops have suffered repeated heavy blows, and the remaining few will not be difficult to clear up in one go. (February 29th)</p>
<h3>Disaster Situation in Over Sixty Counties in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>▲ Distribution of Relief Funds Allocated by Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>▲ Each County Receives from Five Hundred to Three Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since He Long abandoned the plan to rebel in Nanchang on July 31, 1927, the Communists have been lurking in various places, secretly engaging in activities, colluding with bandits, and carrying out sabotage. As a result, the red atmosphere has permeated and become uncontrollable. Last year, out of the 81 counties in the province, only Nanchang, Xinjian, Jinxian, Dongxiang, Linchuan, Fengcheng, Yongxiu, and other counties were not captured by the communist bandits. The remaining counties, such as Ninggang and Yongxin, were completely replaced by bandits. Dexing, Suichuan, and Lianhua were left with no clean land after being burned and killed by the communist bandits. Ningdu, Xingguo, Yudu, and Shicheng are still occupied by Zhu Mao, where it is dark and hopeless. Even the essence of the province, Zhangshu, Hekou, and Jingzhen, have been occupied by the communist bandits several times. Important towns such as Ji'an, Shangrao, Raozhou, and Pingxiang have been looted. The remaining counties have either been gained and lost repeatedly, or the soldiers leave and the bandits come, or the bandits come and the soldiers leave. According to the investigation by the Party Headquarters, approximately one million houses have been destroyed by the bandits in the entire province, and approximately ten million innocent people have been killed. The total loss of property is over ten thousand. The counties with the most severe disasters, such as Lianhua and Yongxin, have been deserted for hundreds of miles, with no signs of life. It is truly a great disaster. The Provincial Government has now distributed 100,000 yuan of emergency relief funds allocated by Chairman Chiang in Jiangxi last year to more than sixty counties severely affected by the disaster. The distribution amounts are as follows: (1) Ji'an, Xingguo, Fuliang, Wanzai, Ningdu, Yongxin, Lianhua, Dexing, Yiyang, Xiushui, and Le'an: each of the above eleven counties will receive 3,000 yuan in relief funds. (2) Ninggang, Xiajiang, Anfu, Leping, Tonggu, Yudu, Wan'an, Jishui, Taihe, Ruijin, and Qianshan: each of the above eleven counties will receive 2,000 yuan in relief funds. (3) Pingxiang, Yongfeng, Fenyi, Shanggao, Xunwu, Wannian, Xinfeng, Yichun, Hengfeng, and Gao'an: each of the above ten counties will receive 1,500 yuan in relief funds. (4) Yujiang, Yihuang, Guixi, Wuning, Xingan, Shicheng, Qingjiang, Poyang, Chongren, Nanfeng, Xinyu, Suichuan, Dageng, Hukou, Huichang, Chongyi, Pengze, Anyuan, Shangyou, Ruichang, Anyi, Fengxin, Duchang, Ganxian, Guangchang, Yifeng, Nankang, and Nancheng: each of the above twenty-nine counties will receive 1,000 yuan in relief funds. (5) Jiujiang and De'an: each of the above two counties will receive 500 yuan in relief funds. (6) Lichuan, Guangfeng, Zixi, Yushan, Xingzi, Linchuan, Yongxiu, Dongxiang, Longnan, Dingnan, Qiannan, Jinxi, Jing'an: The disaster situation in the above counties is relatively light, and the distribution will be delayed (February 19th).</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong's Troops Progressively Depart for Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Sun Lianzhong's 26th Route Army mobilized on the 18th to proceed to Jiangxi. According to a Jining telegram, after the first train of Sun's army departed on the afternoon of the 18th, the remaining trains were delayed due to the late arrival of vehicles and the insufficient time for soldiers to board, preventing them from departing successively. The second train finally departed from Jining at 2:30 PM on the 20th, and the third train also departed from Jining at 1:00 AM on the 21st. The fourth train was scheduled to depart at noon on the 21st. It is said that the second and third trains still consist of Shi Jishu's 80th Brigade, while the fourth train consists of the 81st Brigade. Furthermore, according to Chiang Po-cheng, the Chief Counselor of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters, he received a telegram from Commander Sun on the 19th stating that the 81st Brigade was scheduled to depart on the 20th, but the departure time was not mentioned. No telegram was received from Sun on the 20th, so it is uncertain whether they departed or not. (21st)</p>
<h3>The Negotiation Process for Revising the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Agreement</h3>
<p>▲British Side Still Demands Special Treatment in Profit Distribution</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The business contract for the Guangdong Province's Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, originally signed by the central governments of the two countries, was extremely unbalanced, resulting in significant losses for our side in the profit distribution over the years. Recently, the Ministry of Railways, in order to negotiate a new agreement and recover our rights and interests, specially dispatched Xie Baoqiao, a secretary of the ministry, to Guangdong to work with Liu Juke, the director of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau, to carry out the revision of the agreement. Mr. Xie arrived in the province at the beginning of this month and subsequently convened an informal meeting with British representatives at the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau on the 6th to exchange views in order to effectively revise the agreement. The British side sent Mr. F.P. Philips, the British Consul in Guangzhou, and Mr. Bick, the British Section Manager of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, as representatives. Our side was represented by Xie and Liu. Our representatives put forward opinions on revising the agreement, arguing that the Sino-British agreement on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was signed in the third year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, and the agreement stated that it could be amended five years after its effective date. Now, the agreement has expired for fifteen years and should have been revised long ago, but it has not been implemented due to the many political upheavals in China in recent years. It is found that the entire Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is 111 miles long, with the Chinese section accounting for 89 miles and the British section only 22 miles. According to the usual practice, the profits should be distributed in proportion to the length of the railway line. However, the original agreement stipulated that the Chinese side only receives 65% of the total operating surplus, while the British side receives as much as 35%. This proportion is very unfair. The Ministry of Railways has specially dispatched a commissioner to Guangdong to negotiate this matter, and this meeting is convened today in the hope that the British side will understand. The British Consul expressed great sympathy for this reason, but he had no direct authority to respond and needed to consult the Governor of Hong Kong before responding. Our side believed that since the Governor of Hong Kong was responsible for handling the matter, he should be consulted directly. Therefore, Xie and Liu went to Hong Kong on the 9th and met with Governor Peel at 10:00 AM on the 10th. Mr. Clerk, the British Section Manager of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and the Secretary for Chinese Affairs of Hong Kong were also present. The two sides began negotiations. Our representatives presented the above-mentioned reasons for the revision and put forward the following three principles for revising the agreement: (1) The previous agreement has expired for more than fifteen years, and the current environment has changed greatly compared to the time when the agreement was signed. The original agreement urgently needs to be revised. (2) The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway business contract is purely a joint transportation business contract and should not involve other matters.</p>
<p>(3) The operating surplus of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway should be fairly distributed in proportion to the length of each section of the line. The Governor of Hong Kong largely understood the first two items, but the third item could only be recognized with conditions. The requirements for the third item were: 1. Although the British section is short, several tunnels were built during the construction of the road, and the project cost a great deal. If the surplus profit is distributed in proportion to the length of the line, it would inevitably be at a disadvantage. Therefore, a special reward should be given when profits are obtained. 2. It is hoped that the Chinese section will organize vehicles and road tracks. The above is the first negotiation process between China and Britain to amend the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Agreement. Xie and Liu returned to the province on the evening of the 10th and telegraphed the Ministry of Railways about the progress of the negotiations. The formal amendment conference will be held after instructions are received. (February 12th)</p>

<p>Road Width Determined to be 14 Meters: The Suzhou City expanded six major roads.</p>
<p>The city government had previously approved the street width to be 14 meters. Recently, the Construction Bureau received an order from the Construction Department stipulating street widths of 12 meters, 16 meters, 20 meters, and up to 30 meters. The citizens of Suzhou believe that the provincial order does not include a width of 14 meters. The streets that have already been widened to 14 meters must continue to be widened to 16 meters, which the people cannot afford. The county government and the Chamber of Commerce jointly telegraphed the provincial authorities, requesting that the width of 14 meters be approved. Yesterday, the provincial government issued an instruction to approve this.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Dark Secrets in the Prison: In December of last year, the County Government of this county arrested five suspected bandits, including Chen Dinghuang, from a fishing boat in Jiangbei within the 14th District. Later, due to lack of evidence, they were released on bail pending further investigation. The day before yesterday (the 18th) was the date for the resumption of the trial of the case. However, the defendants, including Chen Dinghuang, did not report to the court. Only the plaintiffs, Lu Antao, Zhang Agen, Huang Abing, Guan Guisen, and the township policeman Zhou Weizhen, etc., arrived. The trial was opened by examiner Shen Hengsheng. It was announced that Chen Ding and others had filed a counterclaim accusing them of falsely accusing innocent people of being bandits. As a result, Lu Antao and the other five were released on bail. However, because there were no reliable guarantors, they were temporarily detained. Unexpectedly, these five were sent to the detention center, where they were immediately shackled and imprisoned. The next day, Zhang Dekang, the district chief of the district, went to consult County Magistrate Tan for instructions. County Magistrate Tan personally went to the detention center to investigate and indeed saw that Lu Antao and others were shackled. Zhou Weizhen (the township policeman) also complained in person about extortion. After County Magistrate Tan returned to the office, he secretly questioned Zhou and others. Zhou Weizhen stated that he was currently a township policeman in Lingqiao Township, 14th District. The night before last (the 18th), he was instructed to be detained and sent to the detention center. The jailer immediately shackled him and took one silver dollar and six small coins from his body. Later, a person from the Shouchanghao store went to Xia Laoban (i.e., Xia Degong) of the Lizhaohao store and asked for money to be sent in. He said he had no money. They said if he had no money, he would have to do hard labor such as washing chamber pots. Later, he said that he had a nephew in the clothing store opposite Yutai in Xiaodongmen, named Chen Boqing, to raise money. Another person wrote a letter for him and sent it. The original letter was submitted as evidence. When Xia Degong was questioned, he firmly denied extorting Zhou's silver and coins, only admitting to taking 44 copper coins. As for the search, it was the duty of the jailers, and he had no right to interfere. After the questioning, the official ordered that Xia Degong be taken into custody and ordered the court bailiff Chen Debiao to accompany Zhou Weizhen to the detention center to identify the person who wrote the letter for further questioning. At around 6:00 PM, Zhou returned to the county government because he had not identified the person. As a result, it was ordered that Zhou and the other five be released on bail.</p>
<p>Pessimism in the Financial World After Final Account: The silver and money business in this county has been exceptionally developed in recent years. However, the situation last year was quite pessimistic. According to the financial world, large and small banks and money shops all suffered bad debts this year, with the total amount reaching over 1,100,000 yuan (some say 500,000 yuan). Among them, Lihua Bank suffered the most. The three money shops of Yilong, Tongyi, and Shencheng, which have always been known for their prudence, are the most affordable, but it is still difficult to make a profit. Daxing Bank also has a considerable loss. The biggest loss belongs to Shenxin and Fuxin. Runkang Money Shop has been losing money for years, and the owner, surnamed Zhao, may stop operating altogether because of the division of the family business among his brothers. Some say it is still intended to be maintained. However, Xu, the assistant manager of the shop, has left Runkang and is organizing a bank called Xiechang Money Shop by recruiting new shareholders. The contract of Xiechang Money Shop has expired this spring, and an internal reorganization has been made with the addition of Hu Wenzao. It is said to be operating on a large scale, and the brand name has been changed to Zhenye, which will open soon.</p>
<p>The Joint Fraud Case Has Been Submitted to the High Court for Review: The joint large-scale fraud case that shocked the entire city has been separately judged by the county government.

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Absconding with Money and Denying Husband: Ma Yunlong, residing outside the Customs Office in this city, married Baozhu, the daughter of Hua Bao Yuan, the owner of the Huadechang Coal Shop, seven years ago. The couple lived together in Nanjing. Unexpectedly, in 1928, the woman suddenly had an affair with a certain army company commander, Kuang Jinbiao. Within two months, she absconded with all of Ma's clothes and belongings, taking refuge in Fuzhou. Ma found out about this and came to Yangzhou to pursue her father-in-law. However, Mr. Hua firmly denied that Ma was his son-in-law. Therefore, Ma filed a lawsuit with the Jiangsu High Court in November of last year, requesting a pursuit. At that time, Hua's daughter had returned to Yangzhou from Fujian and went to court to argue that Ma was not her husband. Their relationship was because Ma had kidnapped her seven years ago. She asked the court to sentence Ma for kidnapping, etc. The prosecutor believed that Hua's daughter was guilty of violating Article 250 and Article 60 of the Criminal Law. The matter was publicly prosecuted and the court set a date for the Criminal Court to try the case. The Hua family insisted that Ma's words were not real and that he kidnapped her. They presented five points of evidence. In the end, the court ordered that Hua Baozhu be taken into custody pending a thorough investigation before a judgment is made.</p>

<p>Bandit Leader Shoots Bandit Informer: Zhang Xiangrong from Zhanghu, Fenghua, was restless and joined a bandit gang. He served as a bandit informer under Wu Tianbao for a long time. Recently, he used Wu Tianbao's name to threaten villagers and extort money from door to door. Wu heard about this and was furious. Yesterday, he summoned Zhang Xiangyun to the bandit ship at Shikongtou, claiming to have something to discuss and asking him to pay for his ticket. Zhang boarded the ship. Wu Tianbao did not show his anger and prepared a good meal to entertain him. After the drinking was over, he ordered his subordinates, including Shen Yongshou, to interrogate Zhang on the ship. After the interrogation, he took out two fast guns, took off Zhang Xiangyun's coat, and ordered him to kneel on the bow of the ship for execution. Then he threw the body into the sea. Major Fire at Dadaotou: A fire broke out at Wanmao Tinplate Shop in Dadaotou, Zhenhai, at around 5:00 AM on the 20th. The fire spread rapidly. Nearby shops such as Longxing Lantern Shop, Dongfang Clock Shop, and Qixianghe Candy Shop, etc., were affected, resulting in huge losses.</p>

<h3>Outline of Shaanxi Province's Construction Plan for the 20th Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>▲Drafted by the Shaanxi Provincial Government</p>
<p>The Northwest is the land of abundance of our nation. The five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Xinjiang are rich in resources, both underground and above ground, which are beyond calculation. If the government wishes to consolidate the Northwest frontier and establish a foundation for lasting prosperity, there is no better strategy than to exert effort in developing these five provinces. Shaanxi Province is located on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, controlling the vital passage of the Northwest, connecting the rich areas of the country internally, and bordering the vast territories externally.</p>
<p>To increase national wealth, it is essential to develop the Northwest, and to develop the Northwest, it is especially necessary to start with Shaanxi. For more than a decade, Guanzhong has been plagued by turmoil, warlord separatism, and people living in misery. Adding to this the rare famine of the past four years, the fields are barren. To attempt construction is truly not easy. However, where there is a will, there is a way. If there is a spirit of self-improvement, it is certain that one can gradually reach the city of light. Now, at the beginning of the 20th year, based on the following three methods, a plan outline is compiled for the construction projects to be implemented within a year, to serve as a basis for action. Before describing the plan, please allow me to first discuss the methods:</p>
<p>(1) The people and finances of Shaanxi Province are in extreme difficulty. The success of construction projects cannot be guaranteed without relying on the power of the Central Government. For matters such as building railways, establishing a large Yellow River hydroelectric plant, improving the Yellow River and Wei River navigation routes, and exploiting the Yanchang oilfields, the provincial financial resources are truly insufficient. All these matters require the Central Government to actively handle.</p>
<p>(2) Smaller-scale transportation and industrial projects will be actively planned and constructed by the provincial government, in accordance with the provisions of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction and in coordination with the Central Government's initiatives.</p>
<p>(3) The Central Government will encourage domestic experts to come to Shaanxi for investigation and research, and will also encourage industrialists to invest in Shaanxi. The provincial government will diligently assist in this matter and work together to carry it out.</p>
<p>The above three items are drafted after careful consideration of the actual situation in Shaanxi Province. Those within the scope of the province that should be implemented in order will be arranged according to the speed of their effectiveness and the magnitude of their benefits, so as to determine the sequence of implementation. Efforts will be made to promote them in the shortest possible time, so that all neglected tasks can be revived and the people's livelihoods can be relied upon.</p>
<p>First, Regarding the Finances of Construction Projects:</p>
<p>The progress of construction projects requires both human and financial resources. After the disasters in Shaanxi Province, financial resources have been depleted. To attempt construction, financial resources must be carefully considered. It is planned that the provincial government will raise several million yuan within this year to establish a Shaanxi Industrial Bank in Xi'an, and request the Ministry of Finance to approve its issuance of banknotes as a fund for Shaanxi's construction projects. In the future, as business develops, branches will be established in various provinces, such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Lanzhou, Ningxia, Xining, and Suzhou. There is a need to establish branches in these places, as Shaanxi merchants have footprints in all of them, and the goods of the Northwest rely on their transportation to reach the Far East and the southern provinces. They have long suffered from the lack of a suitable bank for remittance and storage, which has affected commerce and caused significant losses. If the Shaanxi Industrial Bank can be established on a solid foundation, it can be confidently predicted that its business will prosper, and all of Shaanxi's construction projects will have strong support, which will naturally be solved easily.</p>
<p>Second, Regarding Transportation: In addition to the Longhai Railway and the Tongcheng Railway, which require the Central Government to actively implement, there are approximately eight aspects of automobile roads, long-distance telephones, etc., that are planned to be completed or surveyed and designed in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(A) Xi-Tong Automobile Road: This road extends eastward from Xi'an, passing through the four counties of Lintong, Weinan, Huaxian, and Huayin, to reach Tongguan, with a total length of approximately 150 kilometers. It is planned to improve the existing dirt roads and pave stone ballast roads in important sections, such as the 30 kilometers between Xi'an and Lintong, and the 20 kilometers between Tongguan and Huayin Temple and the foot of Mount Hua. It is estimated that a total of 150,000 yuan will be required.</p>
<p>(B) Xi-Chang Automobile Road: This road extends northwest from Xi'an, passing through the five counties of Xianyang, Liquan, Qianxian, Yongshou, and Binxian, to reach Changwu, with a total length of approximately 180 kilometers. It is planned to first improve the dirt roads to facilitate Shaanxi-Gansu transportation. The average cost per kilometer is estimated at 500 yuan, for a total cost of approximately 90,000 yuan. (C) Xi-Feng Automobile Road: This road starts from the Xianyang section of the Xi-Chang Road and extends westward, passing through the four counties of Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, and Qishan, to reach Fengxiang. It then extends northwest from Fengxiang, passing through Qianyang County to reach Longxian, with a total length of approximately 230 kilometers. The construction work is the same as the Xi-Chang Road, but the Qianlong area has some mountains. The cost per kilometer is estimated at 500 yuan, for a total cost of approximately 115,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(D) Xi-Yu Automobile Road: This road also starts from the Xianyang section of the Xi-Chang Road and extends northward, passing through the fourteen counties of Jingyang, Sanyuan, Yaozhou, Tongguan, Yijun,中部, Ganquan, Fushi, Yanchang, Qingjian, Suide, Mizhi, to reach Yulin, with a total length of approximately 700 kilometers. Tongguan's coal is a necessity for the vicinity of Xi'an. The price of coal in Xi'an is over 30 yuan per ton, due to the inconvenience of transportation. It is planned to flatten the slopes and widen the roadbed of the Tongguan to Qingjian Jiaokou section of the automobile road, and convert it into a light railway with a gauge of one meter and rails weighing 18 pounds, with a total length of approximately 105 kilometers. The estimated cost of laying the track and vehicles is over 520,000 yuan.</p>
<p>After this road is completed, it is necessary to plan to extend it northward to reach Yulin and three other places, which are prosperous commercial areas in northern Shaanxi. Jiaokou Town is located on the Wei River and is the center of cotton production in Guanzhong. It is only five or six kilometers away from the Lingkou Station of the Xi-Tong Road. In the future, a textile factory can be established here, supplied with the abundant cotton from northern Shaanxi and the ample coal from Tongguan, which will surely become an industrial center. A hydroelectric plant can be established in the Chakou area of Yao County to power the railway vehicles. However, this has not been thoroughly investigated and further research is needed.</p>
<p>The above four roads are planned to be completed within this year. However, the Xi'an-Xi-Feng-Xi三 roads must pass through Xianyang west of Xi'an, cross the Wei River, and then move on. A bridge over the Wei River must be built, which is planned to be a stone bridge, costing approximately 300,000 yuan. The Xianyang to Jingyang section of the Xi-Yu Road also needs to cross the Jing River. It is planned to build a stone ford and a stone bridge over the Jing River, costing approximately 150,000 yuan. If these two bridges can be built, the Xi-Tong, Xi-Chang, and Xi-Yu automobile roads can be permanently connected, which will greatly facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>(E) The middle and north section of the Xi-榆 Automobile Road: This section extends from Tongguan to Yulin, with a length of approximately 600 kilometers, passing through the ten counties of中部 Yanchang, etc.中部 is the location of the tomb of the Yellow Emperor, Yanchang is the oil center of northern Shaanxi, and Yulin is the key to the northern gate of the province. Along the route, it is either an area for the production of wool and leather, or a place very suitable for cultivation and animal husbandry. The alkali of Shenmu and the salt of Dingbian both have the hope of development, and the coal in Fugu, Shenmu, Yulin, and other places is directly comparable in quality to that of Shanxi. It is truly valuable to build an automobile road to facilitate communication. However, the mountains and plains are difficult to reorganize, and the project is costly. It is planned to average 5,000 yuan per kilometer, for a total cost of 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>(F) Feng-Han Automobile Road: This road extends from Fengxiang, passing through Baoji, crossing the Wei River, entering the Qinling Mountains, and passing through the counties of Fengxian, Liuba, and Baocheng, to reach Nanzheng, and then extends eastward to Chenggu, with a total length of approximately 280 kilometers. Hanzhong is a rich area of Shaanxi Province, with abundant products that are in urgent need of development. Once this road is open, the north can reach the provincial capital by car, and the east can reach Hankou by boat. However, the mountain roads are rugged and difficult to build, with an average cost of 10,000 yuan per kilometer, for a total cost of approximately 2.8 million yuan. A bridge over the Wei River costs approximately 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(G) Xi-Shang Automobile Road: This road extends from Xi'an through Lantian to Shangxian, and extends southeast to Longjuzhai, with a length of approximately 200 kilometers. Shangxian is the southeastern gateway of Shaanxi Province. Downstream from Longjuzhai along the Dan River, one can reach Laohekou in Hubei, which is also an important transportation route between Shaanxi and Hubei. Except for the section from Xi'an to Lantian, which is a flat road, the rest winds through mountain valleys. The plan is to average 10,000 yuan per kilometer, for a total cost of 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The above three roads are planned to be surveyed on the ground within this year, and details will be awaited for construction. In addition, the longer lines such as Yuan-Da (Sanyuan to Dali) and Yuan-Li (Linyou, Liquan connecting to the Xi-Chang Road) and the intercommunication of various counties are all the responsibility of the counties to build in order, and are not directly implemented by the provincial government. (H) Long-Distance Telephone: It is planned to be implemented in three phases. The first phase is to set up lines from Xi'an to the various counties along the old road. The second phase is to set up two main lines, one north to Yulin and one south to Nanzheng. The third phase is to set up branch lines on the north and south roads, costing approximately 300,000 yuan.

<h3>The Confusing Gold Market Last Week in Financial News</h3>
<p>▲A Flourish at the Start, Waning at the End... Extremely Confusing</p>
<p>The gold price last week remained extremely confusing, with a difference of more than twenty taels per day. This was truly due to the issue of Sino-American loans, with conflicting news, which caused people to be uncertain and at a loss. However, this week coincided with the end of the lunar year, with two days of market closure, so the market situation for the remaining four days, since Thursday, saw a new high of 799 taels. This was mostly due to a certain Mr. Lu, a major speculator, who made purchases. The foreign exchange market was tense, and suddenly there was a rumor of a telegram from the United States about rescuing the silver shortage. Also, the Chinese loan situation was uncertain, which caused the market atmosphere to become chaotic again. Mr. Lu suddenly sold at a high price, which immediately caused a sharp drop of more than twenty taels. After that, the market rose and fell frequently. Until the end of the week, it barely broke the 760 taels mark. The difference between the highest and lowest prices was 35 taels and 5 mace. Compared to the previous week, it fell 21 taels and 6 mace, which was a reaction after a large increase. As for the overseas silver market, it fluctuated. The overall statistics show that the big road rose 0.0625, the US silver price rose 0.125, and the Shanghai English exchange rate rose by half a grade (estimated at 0.125). The bank's internal market also showed a loosening discount, exceeding one shilling and two pence and more. Professionals successively sold to cash in the receipts. The settlement price, calculated according to the exchange rate of the day, initially pressed about 70 taels, but later pressed more than 90 taels. The spot market seemed to be launching, so the receipts were also increased by about one tael compared to the gold price. Remembering that the gold market opened on the sixth day of the first lunar month last year (February 4, 19th year), the opening price was 492 taels, the highest price was 500 taels and 7 qian, and the closing price was 495 taels and 1 qian. Compared with the end of the previous year, it rose 15 taels and 1 qian. However, in a year's review, the difference is as huge as 260 taels. At that time, the big road was 20 pence and 0.01875, the US silver price was 43.625 cents, and the Shanghai shilling was listed at 1 shilling 11.5 pence to 25 pence. However, it was lower than before. Unexpectedly, the domestic and foreign market conditions have now changed greatly. The high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets and exchange rate gold prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>British and American Silver Prices Both See Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday (Sunday), the London telegram stated that the recent big road rebounded 25 to 12 pence 4375 (equivalent to 1 shilling 2.625 pence for British gold). The futures also rose 25, amounting to 12 pence 3125. Foot Chinese bought in, but the transaction was small, so the market was calm. A New York telegram was also received, stating that the US silver price rose sharply by 1 cent, with the spot price being 27.25 cents. The British exchange rate against the US dollar plus 0.03125 is 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 625. The US exchange rate against the British pound plus 0.09375 is 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 32/23. The Japanese exchange rate against the US dollar remains at 49 yuan 4375. The British exchange rate against the Japanese yen remains at 2 shillings 0.04375. The English exchange rate against Shanghai adds 0.01875, being 1 shilling 2.5625 pence. Bombay's spot price increased by 5 annas, amounting to 42 rupees 0.08 annas.</p>
<h3>Discount Up, Break-Even on Sunday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and it was also when the money market was not doing the afternoon market, so the price was only in the morning market. The bank's news was exceptionally quiet. The discount price in the early market was 7 qian 2 fen 3 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half, which was 6 hao 2 hu and a half higher than the previous day. The silver discount still borrowed to make out the remittance draft for 365,000 yuan in the early market. Banknotes 15,000. The public receipts for foreign currency were over 1.5 million, and the public receipts for silver were over 13 million. Transactions for small money shops were only over 200,000. In the auxiliary currency market, the early market for Jiangnan small foreign currency was 6 qian 7 fen 3 li, with 2,000 jiao traded. Guangdong small foreign currency was 6 qian 6 fen 8 li, with 165,000 jiao traded. Copper coins shrank again by 6,000, to 365,000 coins.</p>
<h3>Securities: The Bond Market in the Last Three Days</h3>
<p>▲Bond Prices Hover Steadily... Trading Volume Over 14 Million</p>
<p>Last week coincided with the Lunar New Year. Transactions were suspended from Monday to Wednesday. The second half of the week only had two sessions in the morning, because it was the beginning of the Lunar New Year and the out-of-town merchants and brokers had not arrived yet. It was found that the market in these three days was sluggish. Only 19,200 yuan were made in the opening, and each bond only had several thousand yuan. The futures market was also very calm. The average daily volume for the fifth and second days was 3.78 million, and the weekend day was higher, with 7.1 million. The total was 14,463,000 yuan. Among them, the Demobilization, 19th Year Benevolent, and 20th Year Tobacco bonds were more active. Demobilization was 2,935,000 yuan, 19th Year Benevolent was 2,945,000 yuan, and 20th Year Tobacco was 2,785,000 yuan. The 19th Year Customs had 2,475,000 yuan, the Reorganization and Relief had 1.9 million yuan, and the others were very scarce. For example, the 96 Public Bond had 580,000 yuan, the Customs was 515,000 yuan, the Reorganization 6% was 430,000 yuan, and the Financial, 19th Year Tobacco, 7th Year, etc., were about 20,000 yuan each. Regarding the price changes of each market last week, although there were no obvious changes in the bond market environment, and there were no large-scale entries and exits by major buyers, the market needed activity, and investors from all parties were active. Some major players occasionally sold at high prices, but the buying sentiment always prevailed, and the market gradually rose, without showing any signs of weakening. The supply and demand situation was still balanced, and the price was becoming firmer every day, but the trend was still peaceful. In these three days, except for the 20th Year Tobacco, which rose by 1 yuan and 2 jiao, the others only rose by about half a yuan. Judging from the market situation, it seems that there will not be a large increase or decrease in the short term. The high, low, and change statistics of each bond price in the last three days are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>US Cotton Continues to Rise, British and Indian Cotton Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market fluctuated due to the possibility of large deliveries. It was initially weak due to long positions closing, and then rebounded due to short positions covering. The futures rose 1 to 3 points, and the spot rose 5 points. British cotton futures fell 10 points, and the spot fell 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot was unchanged. Indian cotton initially fell slightly with US cotton, but then became weaker due to long positions taking profits. Pingguoer fell 6 rupees, and the long fell 8 rupees. Aomula and Bairuoxi's near and far futures both fell 7 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 21st):</p>

<h3>Sharp Rise in Yarn Prices Causes Disputes</h3>
<p>In the past year, the yarn market saw a straight decline from 164 taels and 9 mace in January to a low of 135 taels and odd mace in mid-December, falling as low as 42 or 43 taels. Towards the end of the year, merchants, to avoid new year settlements and extend their accounts, absorbed some yarn, causing a turn. On the first day of this year, with overseas markets showing stability and the exchange rate reversing, plus the new tax rate implemented from January 1st, it was expected that general prices would increase. This revitalized the market, pushing prices upward. In February, the market became even stronger, as foreign cotton yarn markets remained firm and speculation in exchange rates intensified. Confidence grew, and the long-depressed market finally rallied. Prices for each month exceeded the previous year's peaks. The yarn market, which had been falling for a year, recovered its bullish momentum in just over a month. The futures market was closed for five days starting February 14th for settlement. During the closure, all factors favored buyers. When the market reopened on the 20th, activity surged, and the spot yarn market was unusually tight. Yarn prices rose by eight or nine taels. At the morning opening, buyers rushed in, and sellers disappeared. February contracts traded at 173 taels, up two taels and odd mace. March contracts traded at 177 taels, up three taels and six mace and odd cash. Some even bid up to 185 taels, a rise of ten taels compared to before the closure. The price increase was excessive, leading to disputes. Discussions continued into the afternoon, with buyers agreeing to temporarily release some of their holdings. The exchange also conducted spot sales to regulate the market. Brokers agreed on a price limit for cotton yarn. The exchange increased the special margin by 30 taels per bale, requiring a total of 50 taels in cash to continue trading. February contracts closed at 175 taels and 8 mace, up five taels. March contracts closed at 177 taels, up five taels and odd mace. April contracts closed at 178 taels and odd mace, up five taels. May contracts closed at 179 taels and odd mace, up five taels. June contracts closed at 179 taels and odd mace, up five taels. July contracts closed at 179 taels and odd mace, up five taels. All months reached peaks not seen in eighteen years. The following compares the average yarn prices from December of last year to the present:</p>

<p>The cotton market suffered from poor domestic cotton harvests. Inland stocks could not be transported due to transportation difficulties, resulting in demand exceeding supply. Fortunately, foreign cotton was sold cheaply, and many manufacturers placed orders. However, this year's exchange rate decline made it uneconomical to calculate costs. Those who settled prices faced losses. Under the current circumstances, settling prices at the origin was still advantageous, but shipping to Shanghai would incur significant losses. Unable to do otherwise, they turned to domestic cotton. Holders of goods saw an opportunity for speculation, and speculators further manipulated the market, making the price surge even more intense than in the yarn market. During the exchange's closure, American cotton remained stable, but Indian cotton rose by over ten rupees. The exchange rate also tightened. When the market reopened on the 20th, due to (1) yarn market disputes and (2) excessively high bids, trading was delayed until the afternoon. Each lot required a special margin of 12 taels, totaling 20 taels per lot. With major players agreeing to sell some holdings and the exchange conducting spot sales, the market calmed down, rising one tael and odd mace to one tael and odd cash compared to before the closure. Currently, the major player behind this is the Japanese company Toyo Cotton, with holdings estimated at over 100,000 bales, ambitiously calling for 50 taels before selling. The future is even more precarious than the yarn market. The following compares the average Hankow Standard cotton prices from December of last year to the present:</p>
<p>Month December January February (up to 20th) February vs. December</p>
<p>Period Highest Lowest Highest Lowest Highest Lowest</p>
<p>12 3500 1135</p>
<p>1 5325 3095 5670 3345</p>
<p>2 3300 3075 3795 3320 4500 3705 up 1425</p>
<p>3 3285 3075 3775 3310 4500 3710 1425</p>
<p>4 5275 5075 5780 5305 4500 3710 1425</p>
<p>5 5275 5080 5765 3310 4500 3705 1420</p>
<p>6 5760 5355 4500 3690</p>
<p>7 4500 3705</p>
<p>From the two tables above, the price surge in the yarn market is sharp, but the price surge in the cotton market is even more intense. The main reason is the difference in inventory conditions. Currently, the price surge in the yarn and cotton markets inevitably has some speculative elements. However, in reality, it is reasonable to a certain extent. Although China's spinning capacity has exceeded four million spindles, it is still far from meeting the population's needs. Therefore, imports of foreign yarn and cloth are increasing daily. Recently, the difference in gold and silver prices has widened, the exchange rate has tightened, and import tariffs have increased, significantly impacting foreign imports. This will lead to a general increase in prices. Furthermore, changes in the exchange rate and the direct competition from Japanese products in China are gradually materializing. The price surge in the cotton market is also contributing to this. Therefore, the yarn market's price surge should not be considered to have reached a reasonable level. The cotton market is even tighter than the yarn market. Even in years with good harvests, domestic cotton production is insufficient to meet domestic consumption. As textile mills gradually produce higher-quality products, imports of foreign cotton are increasing. According to customs records, foreign cotton imports have reached a staggering 100 million taels. Last year's poor harvest due to climate abnormalities further exacerbated the imbalance between supply and demand. Recently, with soaring gold prices and a tightening exchange rate, foreign cotton prices, when converted to Chinese currency, make domestic cotton prices seem particularly low. The continued rise in the cotton market should not be solely attributed to speculation. In summary, the imbalance in supply and demand naturally leads to rising prices. (Agricultural)</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Market in Jiangxia (North Jiangsu) - Strong in the South, Weak in the North</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei (North Shanghai): Yesterday, very little rice arrived from Jiangxia, and sales were sluggish from all sides.</p>
<p>Due to the excessively sharp price increase the previous day, the northern white rice market saw weak buying interest despite recognizing the meager arrivals. Therefore, prices uniformly retreated slightly. Paddy rice trading was mediocre and generally flat. Premium and genuine glutinous rice were rare and sold quickly, maintaining stable prices. Limited shipments of Dabu glutinous rice arrived, and with sluggish sales from out-of-town merchants, factory owners and sellers inevitably hoarded and pushed up prices. This led to a continued improvement in the overall trend. Exchange trading was sluggish, showing signs of weakness. Shadow Yuan trading was still good, coupled with scarce arrivals and depleted inventories, resulting in a firm market.</p>
<p>▲South Shanghai: Yesterday's market started strong but ended flat. About 30-40 boats arrived from inland. Northern white rice from Changshu and Wuxi had excellent buying interest in the morning, and prices initially showed signs of increase. However, due to weak offtake and mediocre news from the north, the market turned flat. Machine-milled glutinous rice from Suzhou and Tongzhou sold well both in retail and wholesale, so prices were optimistic. The overall market price opened around 11.5 yuan. Although sellers of early-season paddy rice from southern Jiangsu wanted to push up prices, the market was flat due to weakness in Zhabei, so prices generally remained unchanged in the afternoon. Supplies of top-grade glutinous rice were thin, and ordinary glutinous rice was also scarce, resulting in good prices. Exchange trading was poor, with limited buying from distilleries and sluggish sales. The overall situation was unstable. Throughout the day, trading was most sluggish for top-grade white rice.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse and White Sugar Fall by One Mace</h3>
<p>▲Over 200 Bags of Cotton Lake Red Sugar Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from production areas. Due to Sunday, there were no telegrams. The association market's trading volume was low. Dutch 20# white sugar saw little buying interest, but offers were abundant. The transaction price was 11 taels and 2 mace, down one mace from the previous day. The market was generally weak. Finely ground white sugar was 11 taels, 2 mace, and odd cash. 20# white sugar was 10 taels and odd cash. Cuban white sugar was 10 taels. Cuban red sugar was 9 taels and odd cash. Although there were slight transactions, the volume was very small. Japanese sugar trading was also sluggish. N Mark was offered at 11 taels and odd mace, YRO Mark at 11 taels, TK Mark at 11 taels and odd mace, but there were few takers. YT Mark was 11 taels and odd mace, YP Mark was 11 taels and odd mace, TM Mark was 11 taels and odd mace, and SH Mark was 11 taels and odd mace. There were slight transactions, and the market was also flat. The price list included over 200 bags of Cotton Lake red sugar, priced at 10 taels and odd cash. A certain Chaozhou firm opened 20 bags of Hong Kong ice flower green sugar, priced at 9 taels and odd cash. The market sentiment was generally stable.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods: Orchid Seeds Reach New High Price</h3>
<p>▲Opened at 40 Taels and Odd Mace</p>
<p>Only a few dozen piculs of Orchid seeds from last winter's shipments remained, and the scarcity of remaining inventory was unprecedented. This created an unprecedented high price, but land prices continued to tighten, and there was still no intention to sell. Yesterday, the firm's list showed a batch with excellent quality and color, discovering a new high price, reaching 40 taels and odd mace, up one tael from the previous list. Subsequent arrivals were expected to continue to rise. Due to the gradual reduction in inventory, Fujian red dates tightened the market. Yesterday, over 200 bags opened, priced at 6 taels and odd mace. The future market looked upward.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Dai Jitao Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲The Zhongda (Sun Yat-sen University) Crisis Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>▲Sun Ke Visited to Discuss Elections</p>
<p>▲Review Examinations to be Held in April</p>
<p>▲Reported Everything to Nanjing Last Night</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, arrived in Shanghai at 7:40 yesterday morning aboard the Japanese shipping company's "Taiyo Maru" from Hong Kong. Accompanying him were Secretary Zhang Zhenzhi and Jiang Shouchun, the administrator of Zhongda Hospital, and others. Yesterday morning around 7:00, more than a dozen of Dai's relatives and friends were already waiting at the Huishan Wharf. At 7:40, when the ship docked, Dai shook hands with the welcomers and then took a car back to his private residence on Avenue Foch for rest. Shortly after, Railway Minister Sun Ke went to visit him. In the afternoon, Dai returned to Sun's residence to visit Sun, and they talked for a long time. It was heard that they discussed matters related to preparing for the National Assembly elections. A reporter from this newspaper specially interviewed Dai yesterday, and the following is a summary of Dai's remarks:</p>
<p>▲Zhongda Incident: Dai said, "I left Shanghai for Guangdong for a month. Fortunately, the crisis at Zhongshan University in Guangdong has been resolved. The current president will not return to the school for the time being, and the school affairs will continue to be handled by the former director of affairs, Shen Pengfei. After I go to Nanjing and report to the central government, further measures will be decided. While in Guangdong, I met with Gu Yingfen, whose back sores have not fully healed, and his spirits are also not very good. He still needs good care."</p>
<p>▲Ming Shu's Visit to Nanjing: The reporter asked whether Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, had heard that he would go to Nanjing to make requests, and whether the departure date had been set. Dai replied, "I heard about Chen's visit to Nanjing while I was in Guangdong, but the departure date has not yet been determined." He also said, "This time, the central government has appointed me to preside over the preparations for the National Assembly elections. I have no experience in this matter and feel apprehensive under the orders. Furthermore, the deadline is extremely short. I plan to go to Nanjing soon to discuss progress with all parties."</p>
<p>▲Review Examinations: Regarding the progress of the Examination Yuan, Dai said, "The Examination Yuan is currently planning to review the personnel recruited through various examinations held by the provinces since the establishment of the National Government, and issue diplomas to those who pass, in order to confirm their qualifications. The method is roughly to review their previous grades, without the need for further examinations. The planned time for the examinations is April of this year. After these review examinations are completed, the higher and ordinary civil service examinations will be conducted. As for personnel who passed various examinations during the Beijing government era, because the examination procedures are unknown, they cannot be recognized and are naturally not included in the review."</p>
<p>▲Travel to Nanjing Last Night: Dai, together with Railway Minister Sun Ke, took the night train to Nanjing last night at 11 o'clock to report everything to the central government and proceed with preparations for the National Assembly representative elections.</p>
<h3>The People's Livelihood Improvement Research Association Held its Opening Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Kong Xiangxi Gave a Speech on the National Government's Industrial Policy</p>
<p>▲Tao Nai Gave a Speech on How the Industrial System Should Learn from England</p>
<p>The People's Livelihood Improvement Research Association held its opening ceremony at the Sichuan Road YMCA yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Over two hundred Chinese and foreign guests attended. After Minister Kong Xiangxi delivered a speech, he spoke about the National Government's industrial policy. Professor Tao Nai spoke about the contribution of England's labor history to Chinese operations. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Yesterday's Meeting Proceedings: (1) Singing the Party Song, (2) Paying the Highest Respects to the Party, National Flag, and Portrait of the General, (3) The Chairman Reverently Reads the General's Will, (4) Speeches, (5) Refreshments, (6) Adjournment. This morning, discussions will be held on the economic needs of the people. In the afternoon, discussions will be held on improving the people's livelihood. The location is Room 305, 3rd Floor, 23 Yuanmingyuan Road. Starting at 7:30 PM in the evening, Gao Yang, Dean of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Institute, will give a speech entitled "Worker Education."</p>
<p>▲Minister Kong's Speech: "Today, the People's Livelihood Improvement Research Association opens, and Chinese and foreign economists and sociologists gather together. Industrial administrative organs and social service organizations have also sent representatives to attend. Xiangxi is deeply honored to be part of this. The issue of people's livelihood is deeply and significantly related to the future of our society. Dr. Sun Yat-sen especially considered whether the issue of people's livelihood could be realized as the greatest key to the success or failure of the national revolution. Gentlemen of your association, with a sincere spirit and sharp vision, conduct scientific research on practical people's livelihood issues, with insightful views. Recently, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, in view of the urgency of people's livelihood construction, specially merged the Ministries of Agriculture and Mining and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce into the Ministry of Industry. Furthermore, Xiangxi, who is devoted to the Three People's Principles and has served in industrial administration for many years, was still ordered to preside over it. Unable to refuse, I reluctantly agreed to take on the responsibility. However, this matter is of great importance. If people across the country do not work together, it will be difficult to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan in practice, and the Three People's Principles will also be empty words. Therefore, I have high expectations for your association. Modern economists consider the greatest benefit to people's livelihood as the highest goal of economics, and pay attention to the various aspects of production, consumption, exchange, and distribution. Your association's meeting and discussions focus on improving production efficiency, labor welfare, rural life, and urban life, impartially, and taking improving people's livelihood as the common goal, adapting to world trends and social reality, and showing that it has truly gained my heart.</p>
<p>At the beginning of today's opening, I was asked to give a speech on the "National Government's Industrial Policy." Besides being pleased, Xiangxi is also willing to take this opportunity to discuss the outline of the government's industrial plan with you. The National Government's industrial policy takes Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles and industrial plan as its guide. However, the scope is too broad and cannot be described in detail. Therefore, this article will only briefly describe the policies that urgently need to be implemented in the current industrial administration, outlining the main points, totaling eight items: (1) Promoting the scientification of rural areas: Chinese farmers are accustomed to following old ways and only know how to preserve them, without thinking about improvement. The decline of agriculture is due to this. Recently, Chairman Chiang has promoted respect for education and encouragement of agriculture throughout the country, and Dr. Monroe from the United States has come to China to investigate, and also believes that improving the lives of farmers is crucial. He also said that American farmers account for only a quarter of the national population, but their agricultural products are not only sufficient to supply the whole country but also can be sold to foreign countries. Chinese farmers account for more than three-quarters of the national population, but the national food supply is insufficient every year, and the export of silk and tea is declining. The failure to scientify agriculture is the main reason for this, which can be said to be a crucial point. To save it, the most important thing is to establish a central agricultural research institute, and the organization of agricultural education and guidance groups is also urgently needed. This is one of the things that industrial administration is deeply concerned about. (2) Promoting forestry and land reclamation: The Northeast and Northwest are full of bandits, while the Southeast provinces are full of people. Immigrating to the borders will help the development of land reclamation, and cultivating forests is also something that Dr. Sun Yat-sen strongly advocated during his lifetime. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the Ministry of Industry, a special forestry and land reclamation department was established to actively promote and strive for progress. This is the second thing that industrial administration is deeply concerned about. (3) Establishing basic industries: Basic industries are essential for the development of modern industries. When Xiangxi was Minister of Industry and Commerce, he proposed issuing industrial bonds to establish basic industries. Now that unification has been achieved, military affairs have ended, and there are countless construction projects. Establishing basic industries is the most important of all. Among them, steel and the three acids are particularly important and must be urgently pursued without further delay. This is the third thing that industrial administration is deeply concerned about. (4) Protecting infant industries: China's emerging industries are very immature compared to those in Europe and the United States. The way to protect them is to vigorously promote the use of domestic goods in society, and to implement protective tariff policies and anti-dumping duties in the government. This is the fourth thing that industrial administration is deeply concerned about. (5) Implementing scientific management: The success or failure of industry and commerce depends entirely on whether the management methods conform to scientific principles. Chinese merchants do not value scientific management, so at the moment of success, they often harbor the root of gradual decline. They ignore the cost accounting, personnel administration, labor protection, and industrial rationalization that are most valued by industrialists and business people in various countries today. They use extremely outdated business minds to respond to extremely fierce economic competition, and how can they not fail? Looking forward to the future, there are countless worries. To cure the disease, we should prescribe medicine, and we should use the implementation of scientific management as a clear guiding agent. This is the fifth thing that industrial administration is deeply concerned about. (6) Renovating industrial education: In this era of scientific omnipotence, we cannot develop industry without promoting science. It is especially urgent to popularize vocational education and promote scientific research on practical problems. The improvement of production technology, the improvement of professional ethics, and the thorough solution of social and economic problems cannot be achieved without education, industry, mutual assistance, and cooperation. In other words, the education of reading dead books and talking nonsense is definitely not what today's society needs. Students who only know how to destroy but do not know how to build are not what our people entrust their lives to. "Industrializing education" and "education industrializing" are the trends of the world and are also the hope for the new life of our society. If our educational institutions and social service organizations can adhere to this purpose and cooperate with the government, it is time to change our ways. Turning foolishness into wisdom and turning poverty into wealth will all start from this point. This is the sixth thing that industrial administration is deeply concerned about. (7) The necessity of joint economy: Gathering strength is strong, dividing strength is weak. To expand and promote exports and trade, it is impossible to succeed without implementing joint operations. The standardization and simplification of industrial products cannot be achieved without large-scale business organizations. As for production cooperation, consumer cooperation, and credit cooperation, although their purposes are different, there is no doubt that they are excellent economic organizations. After all, business organizations will not be limited to the following four types: 1. Government enterprises, 2. Joint enterprises (such as large-scale company organizations and company mergers), 3. Cooperative enterprises, and 4. Individual enterprises. Each has its own functions and its own limitations. Deliberate coordination is the responsibility of the political authorities. Guiding the situation, then those in the industrial and educational circles have their own part of their divine duty. After all, capital monopoly is not allowed by our party, and to develop externally, government enterprises and joint operations must be advanced together and planned comprehensively. This is the seventh thing that industrial administration is deeply concerned about. (8) Enhancing labor-management coordination: Social organization is an extremely great and mysterious organism. The blood vessels are connected and the fingers and arms are used, all of which have their natural procedures and functions. Those who follow nature are all soundly developed, and those who oppose nature are rarely not full of diseases. In terms of the physiology of a good society and the pathology of a bad society, the elimination of employment disputes and the enhancement of labor-management coordination should be the necessary conditions for economic life in the new era. Moreover, in terms of the spirit of Christianity, everyone is a sacred worker, and there is no distinction between the labor and capital classes. Therefore, labor and capital should cooperate, and even if they are both workers, they should help each other. A country with a strong self-reliance and a good mutual assistance will prosper, and those who do not will fail. The key to the great cause of nation-building lies entirely in this. This is the eighth thing that industrial administration is deeply concerned about. The above is a brief description of the government's position and the outline of industrial administration. Discussions and research are not afraid of seeking details. By working together and advancing bravely, we can gradually implement the industrial plan and realize the Three People's Principles as soon as possible. This is what Xiangxi hopes for from the gentlemen of your association and the people across the country."</p>
<p>▲Professor Tao Nai's Speech: "The industrial revolution in Europe started earliest in England. From the 18th century onwards, it gradually spread from France and Germany to the whole of Europe. From the 24th century onwards, it was introduced to various countries in East Asia, such as Japan and China. As for the causes of the industrial revolution, they can be divided into two aspects: (1) Changes in economic technology, (2) Changes in social organization. The most important modern social issue is labor and capital. The occurrence of labor and capital problems is due to three reasons: First, workers organize trade unions, second, workers organize cooperative movements, and third, workers organize labor parties. In my personal opinion, organizing political movements is actually an unimportant task. The most important things are: first, the awakening of the people, which is the workers themselves organizing from the bottom up, producing a new culture. This new culture is built on the foundation of mutual aid, service, and unity of the people. To give an example, such as consumer cooperatives, in England, 5 million families have joined, a total of 15 million people, to build the economic consumption problems of the people. The second is people's education, so that they can develop into good citizens. The third is people's politics. In England, the governments of large cities are mostly in the hands of workers, organized by the workers. If the British Labor Party disappears now, the power of the people's organization can still exist permanently. As for the British economic transformation policy, it is completely reformist, which is different from the revolutionary doctrines of other countries on the mainland. There are four such policies: (1) Raising the living standards of the people, (2) Expanding the scope of social services, (3) Reforming basic industries and nationalizing large industries, (4) Using most of the donations and taxes to seek the happiness of the people. The method of implementing the policies is not to use force, but to use labor legislation, on the one hand, to eliminate child labor and female labor, increase wages, shorten working hours, improve artificial hygiene, and working conditions, and on the other hand, to popularize education and develop people's knowledge. Therefore, although there are unemployment problems now, there will be methods to solve them in the future. China has always been an agricultural country, and now the center of social problems is also the peasant problem. China should refer to the experiences of France, southern Germany, and Denmark, because China's current peasant problems are the same as those in Europe in the past. The first is disasters, the second is the backwardness of agricultural production methods, and the third is the lack of capital. Now, we can refer to the methods used in Europe in the past to solve these problems. The methods include: (1) Improving transportation, (2) Applying scientific methods, (3) Credit cooperation. Regarding industrial problems, it is a question whether China can adopt the large industrial system of England and the United States. However, China's future modern industry must be developed, so China should study the past experiences of England, abandon all the malpractices in England's industrial history, and seek its development."</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce Must Be Approved by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission When Filing for Registration</h3>
<p>▲Attention Overseas Chinese Businessmen</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce in various regions have recently, due to the government's promulgation of the Chamber of Commerce Law, requested their respective consulates to forward their applications for registration to the domestic government agencies. These government agencies, considering that the applications had already been reviewed and forwarded by the consulates, assumed that they were without issues and generally approved them without further detailed examination. Unexpectedly, once these chambers of commerce were approved for registration, they considered themselves formal organizations and often refused to accept the guidance of local party branches, leading to frequent disputes. Upon discovering this situation, the central government deemed it necessary to conduct strict reviews of the registration of overseas Chinese chambers of commerce. The Political Council specially issued a letter to the Ministry of Industry, stating that "hereafter, the registration of overseas Chinese chambers of commerce must follow the example of the registration of overseas Chinese schools, and no approval shall be granted without the review and consent of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission." It has been heard that the Ministry of Industry has already replied, agreeing to comply. Therefore, if any overseas Chinese chamber of commerce or guild applies for registration in the future, the Ministry of Industry will directly forward the application to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for review and instructions before further processing.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Based Sichuanese Welcome Xiang Yuren, Member of the Sichuan Provincial Committee</h3>
<p>▲Also Welcome Chen Mingqian</p>
<p>Xiang Yuren, a member of the Sichuan Provincial Committee, was summoned to Beijing by the central government. After paying respects to Commissioners Jiang, Hu, and Shao, he came to Shanghai at the invitation of fellow Sichuanese comrades in Beijing. Yesterday, Shanghai-based Sichuanese members of the Nationalist Party specially held a welcome meeting at the China Construction Association on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Chen Mingqian, who accompanied him, was also welcomed. Over a hundred people attended, including Zhang Yuejun, Zeng Tongyi, Yu Yunliang, and representatives from various Sichuanese armies. Chen Tianmin announced the opening of the meeting, and Huang Douyin presided over it, following the proper rituals.</p>
<p>Chairman Huang Douyin reported the main purpose of the meeting, stating in essence that Comrade Xiang and Comrade Chen had a long and admirable history of revolutionary activities and years of struggle in Sichuan. A welcome meeting was specially held at the Construction Association, which is engaged in revolutionary construction. He then invited Comrade Cao Dushi to deliver a welcome speech. Cao rose and said that Comrade Xiang and Comrade Chen were newly arrived in Shanghai from Sichuan, and therefore fellow Sichuanese comrades and friends had gathered for a tea party to express their welcome. He felt inadequate to deliver a speech on everyone's behalf and hoped that Comrade Xiang, Comrade Chen, and all the fellow Sichuanese comrades would fully forgive him. They welcomed Comrade Xiang and Comrade Chen today because the two comrades are veteran members of the party. In recent years, the reason why the party affairs in Sichuan have been maintained is entirely due to Comrade Xiang's painstaking efforts and persistent struggle. Moreover, everyone knows that Comrade Xiang is straightforward, frank, selfless, and has been fighting for the party and the country both inside and outside Sichuan for many years. Some of them are new friends or old acquaintances of Comrade Chen, while others admire the character of Comrade Xiang. Therefore, they have gathered spontaneously today. He thought that the meeting of the two comrades with them in Shanghai, thousands of miles away, was worth expressing warm welcome both in personal friendship and in the party's position. In this warm and grand welcome meeting, they also felt that the revolutionary comrades in Sichuan had long occupied the most important and glorious page in the party's history, and that Sichuan was also one of the birthplaces of the revolution. Now, Sichuan feels behind Guangdong and Zhejiang, allowing the Sichuan situation to be divided and dominated, and Communist bandits are everywhere. Until now, Sichuan has not been able to produce a unified and capable provincial government to realize the party's doctrine and rescue the 70 million people from the depths of misery. Even outsiders talk about Sichuan with a headache for three days. They feel very ashamed when they think of this. Fortunately, Comrade Xiang and Comrade Chen have just come out of Sichuan and must be very clear about the Sichuan situation. They also heard that Comrade Xiang has been fighting in Sichuan for many years, and this time the central government summoned him five times to leave Sichuan for consultation on Sichuan affairs. However, according to the speculations published in various newspapers, it is said that Comrade Xiang's departure from Sichuan this time represents some of the military men in Sichuan. However, they believe that Comrade Xiang's departure from Sichuan uniquely represents the 70 million suffering people, and is appealing to the central government for the sake of the 70 million suffering people. As the saying goes, "Sichuan is the first to be in chaos before the world is in chaos, and Sichuan is the last to be governed after the world is governed." Premier Sun Yat-sen said, "The latecomers surpass the former." They have great hope for Sichuan. Although Sichuan is governed later, they always hope to catch up. In the past, Zhuge Liang governed Sichuan, and was able to "gather ideas from all sources." They hope that everyone can achieve unity of purpose under the principle of gathering ideas from all sources, and be able to manage the chaotic Sichuan province, and restore their glorious history in the past. The Three Principles of the People created by Premier Sun Yat-sen is the doctrine of saving the country, but the country should be based on the people. If they can save the people of Sichuan, they will have done a large part of Premier Sun Yat-sen's will. At the same time, they know that the Communist Party, which kills and sets fire, is actually a natural phenomenon reflected by the contradictory facts in the revolutionary process. As long as the comrades of the party follow Premier Sun Yat-sen's will and strive forward, clarify the politics, and strive to build the people's livelihood, and the Three Principles of the People of the party are realized, and the people of the whole country can make the best use of their talents, the land can make the best use of its resources, the materials can make the best use of their use, and the goods can be freely circulated, the Communist Party will naturally disappear without destroying them. There are too many political crises in Sichuan now. If they do not work hard, the Communist Party's plan is to use Sichuan as their last base for riots, and to use Sichuan as their escape shelter when they fail, because they believe that the current Sichuan is an area where they can move freely, and they will never easily carry out childish riots and cut off their chances of activities unless they have no other choice. If they continue to ignore this situation, they are afraid that the future of Sichuan will be even more tragic than the current situation in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Today, the fellow villagers and comrades gather here and are very enthusiastic. They hope to maintain this enthusiastic spirit and encourage each other with Comrade Xiang and Comrade Chen, and wish the two comrades good health. Then,</p>
<p>Comrade Xiang Yuren delivered a speech, saying in essence that he had been separated from the comrades for a long time, and he was very happy to gather and reminisce thousands of miles away. He was not worthy of being welcomed. This time, he came out of Sichuan in response to the telegram from Hu Hanmin and other gentlemen, and he had no other mission. Rumors outside were not true. Secondly, he personally wanted to come out of Sichuan to travel, visit other constructions, and refresh himself. Furthermore, it was rare to meet with other gentlemen and to talk about the situation in his hometown, weren't all the other comrades concerned about the situation in his hometown? Originally, those who had been out of Sichuan for a long time might not fully understand the situation, and would inevitably have some questions, while the people in their hometowns, isolated in a remote corner, would have many things to ask of them, but both sides rarely had the opportunity. Speaking of the situation in Sichuan, it is naturally very complicated. Today, time is limited, so he had to summarize it and give a brief report. From the outside observations and criticisms of everything in Sichuan, it seems that nothing is lagging behind. They certainly dare not deny this. In fact, the education, construction, military affairs, etc. of Sichuan are not completely undeveloped. For example, the length of the roads in eastern, southern, and northern Sichuan that have been built in recent years has reached about 3,000 miles, which cannot be said to be a small project. Also, the Sichuan army was only tens of thousands in 1920, about 200,000 in 1926, and now it is no less than 300,000. With the addition of the civilian army, it is more than 600,000. Is this increase in quantity considered development? However, this development is always inevitably deformed, because the politics of Sichuan is not unified and lacks a whole plan. What is expressed is nothing more than fragmentary symbols. Even the goals of building roads and increasing troops are mostly based on convenience and needs, and cannot be said to be for the interests of the people and the needs of the society. If not, with such long transportation lines, Sichuan's industry and commerce would not still be medieval industry and commerce. With so many arms, not only is there considerable value in the history of the revolution, but also considerable strength when moved to the international level. Where is it still Sichuan like this? This is all very regrettable. As for the elders of Sichuan, they have to bear a large amount of military expenditure, as well as the unrelated road construction fees and other kinds of fees. Although they groan vaguely, they feel that it is difficult to support them day by day. However, the local militia in the mainland has made progress day by day in recent years. The local order can be maintained in general. Compared with the tragic displacement in Hunan, Hubei, and other places, it is still better, and it is not an unfortunate thing among misfortunes. However, the crisis in Sichuan is lurking. The complexity of ideological factions is difficult to describe in one word. All Communist Party, Nationalist Party, and Social Democratic Party, etc., have everything, and they are carrying out large-scale activities, which is no different from an exhibition of various doctrines. To imagine the future is really a frightening and terrifying thing. If you want to eliminate them, you must first make them lose their respective backgrounds. Their backgrounds are to cater to the psychology of each person's convenience and needs, and to speculate. If everything in Sichuan is systematized, you can eliminate the psychology of each person's convenience and needs. All kinds of incorrect ideological factions have no place to stand. In addition, he has compared the places he has passed by this time, and feels that Sichuan has a gratifying phenomenon, that is, the economic aggression of imperialists against China has not reached a complete level in Sichuan. How can it be seen? In terms of the four major needs of life, Shanghai naturally does not need to be said. All the food, clothing, housing, and transportation are indispensable for imported products. Even the Yangtze River area is slightly better than Shanghai, but the imported products are still many. Compared with Sichuan, except for clothing, woolen, cotton velvet, and other textiles, most of them rely on foreign goods. Other food, housing, and transportation are inexhaustible and inexhaustible in the province. So far, the hidden wealth of nature and the treasures of the earth are as they are, untouched at all. Isn't it a gratifying thing? This kind of place is the hometown of all the comrades and him. All of you care about your hometown, and you must have great plans. You should take responsibility for your hometown. Then, although he came for travel and sightseeing, he will inevitably listen attentively and can also work hard and make suggestions after all of you. If we can fundamentally reform our hometown and build a new Sichuan, that would be the happiness of the 70 million people in Sichuan. Then,</p>
<p>Comrade Chen Mingqian delivered a speech, saying briefly that although he had been following the revolutionary pioneers for many years, he had not made any achievements. Now, he was grateful for your welcome, but he was ashamed to be worthy of it. The reason why the Sichuan situation could not be resolved was that the comrades were not united. They should follow the spirit of unity today and jointly seek a solution to the Sichuan situation. Then, the chairman gave a reply, and the comrades gave free speeches. Then, they took a photo and dismissed the meeting.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Talks About American Silver Loan</h3>
<p>▲No Guarantee, No Success</p>
<p>▲Not Mature, So No Expression</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the US silver loan of 100 million ounces to China, according to recent reports from various parties, it will become a reality. Yesterday, a reporter from the "Daily News" visited Lin Kanghou, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Banking Association, regarding this matter, asking what attitude the local banking community has towards the US silver loan to China. Lin said that the reason why China hopes for the US silver loan is to obtain low-interest and unsecured loans to develop China's construction. However, it is indeed possible for the United States to lend to China at low interest due to the surplus of silver and commodities. However, if the Chinese government does not have a solid guarantee for this loan, it will be difficult to pass in the US Congress. That is to say, a large unsecured loan cannot become a reality. If the Chinese government is eager to seek domestic construction and issue a secured loan, the Chinese banking community still has the strength to undertake it in the current transition period of developing China's construction, and does not urgently rely on foreign loans. In recent years, the main reason why Chinese banks have rarely invested in national construction is due to the frequent wars and various political influences in China. Therefore, the government should first embark on the right track from politics in seeking national construction. Now that the country is unified, the internal strife is pacified, and if the banditry is eradicated, the national economy will tend to develop, and China's initial construction does not need to rely on foreign capital. The so-called US silver loan, once realized, will certainly be welcomed in the Chinese banking community in the future, because it can reduce the government's issuance of public bonds and loans. However, since this loan is so large, the conditions for repayment in the future are actually related to all the people of China, so it is necessary to consider it carefully. However, this matter is still under preparation. Before the National Conference in May of this year, it is unlikely to become a reality. Therefore, the Shanghai banking community believes that this matter is not yet mature, so there is no need to formally express it.</p>
<h3>The Chang Gong Hua Shipping Restores to Pre-War Status</h3>
<p>▲Total of More Than 30 Ships</p>
<p>▲All River Ships Resume Service The entire shipping business of the Sanbei Shipping Company accounts for 90% within the Yangtze River, and only the Ningbo and Fuzhou ships are on the coastal line. On the Yangtze River line, except for the Feihu ship that was sunk and received government compensation, the company has dismantled the machinery from the sunken ship and returned it to Shanghai, giving up salvaging and auctioning it. All ships such as Fulong, Fengpu, Xin Ningxing, Changan, and Dexing have been released by the headquarters and will resume their routes immediately. From today onwards, the Yangtze River line will be restored to its pre-war state. From March 1st, 19 Chinese ships will sail between Shanghai and Hankou, including 19 ships from Zhaoshang, Sanbei, Zhaoxing, Ningshao and other four companies. Twelve ships can be opened upstream of the Yangtze River. Since the Northern Expedition of the National Army, Chinese merchants' river ships have not been able to fully resume business. It was not until today that they resumed their pre-war status.</p>
<p>▲Ningshao Adds New Ships Last year, the Ningshao Commercial Shipping Company purchased a Norwegian ship for 190,000 yuan and named it Ningjing. It was originally planned to sail in the Yangtze River to develop the company's Yangtze River shipping business, but it could not be realized due to the war. The ship was leased to Hong Kong to carry goods until last winter when it was taken back for its own use. Now, all levels of cabins have been rearranged. Taking advantage of the end of military transportation, the company decided to add the Ningjing ship to the Yangtze River line and run between Shanghai and Hankou with the old Ningshao ship.</p>
<p>▲Zhaoshang Develops the Upper Yangtze The bandits in the upper Yangtze are about to be eliminated, and Hunan rice and cotton can be loaded. The Zhaoshang Bureau's Changsha shipping has been expanded, and the business has achieved significant results. The freight revenue in Hankou alone can reach an average of 6,000 taels per day. However, the bureau lacks ships on the Yichang line in the middle of the Yangtze River. Because the cargo transportation in the Yichang and Shashi areas is huge, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Jiejang, and Nissin all have four, five, or six ships sailing. Even the Sanbei Company also has four ships, Hongyuan, Hongheng, Yangan, and Yian. Only one Kuali ship is operated by Zhaoshang, which is somewhat dwarfed in comparison. Having goods but lacking ships and giving up business is the most distressing. General Manager Li has decided to expand the middle of the Yangtze River this year. First, three new ships will be added to the Yisha line. At the same time, a branch bureau will be established in Yichang, and the freight transportation of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces will be under the management of the Yichang Bureau, so as to expand the transportation of goods in the three southwestern provinces as much as possible, and connect and transport them with the Yangtze River line. The plan has been formulated and the Yichang branch bureau has been ordered to actively handle it.</p>
<p>▲Investigation of Current River Ships Currently, the Chinese ships operating on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River include Jiang'an, Jiangshun, Jianghua, Jiangxin, Jianguo, Jiangda, Jiangjing, Jiangyu, Kuali, Emei, Liji, Liyuan, etc. from the Zhaoshang Bureau; Fulong, Fengpu, Xingshi, Changan, Dexing, Xin Ningxing, Hongyuan, Hongheng, Hongli, Hongzhen, Fuyang, Wuxing, and shallow-water ships Yian, Yangan, etc. from the Sanbei Company; Ningshao and Ningjing from Ningshao; Zhaoxing and Yuxing from Zhaoxing. There are more than 30 ships in total, which can be fully launched in March.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Form Large-Scale Business Inspection Group</h3>
<p>▲Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in Early April</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reported that in order to break the domestic economic downturn, the Japanese industrial and commercial circles are increasingly striving to develop trade with China. It is heard that 18 organizations, including the Chambers of Commerce and Industrial Associations of major cities in the Tokaido region, have jointly formed a very large-scale business inspection group, led by the mayor of Nagoya, to come to China for investigation. The group has a total of 1,200 members, which is unprecedented. Therefore, they will specially rent the 10,000-ton giant ship "Rio de Janeiro Maru" to sail to China. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in early April and then go to Suzhou, Hangzhou, Beijing, Zhenjiang, and various ports in the upper Yangtze River to inspect the economic situation and business conditions in the Yangtze River basin in order to promote the Japanese goods market. Before the group arrives in Shanghai, a delegation of 60 representatives of Kansai beer merchants will also arrive in Shanghai on March 9th on the "Shanghai Maru" to inspect business conditions and engage in sightseeing.</p>

<h3>A Young Woman in Her Twenties Dies</h3>
<p>▲Last Will Advises Young Girls</p>
<p>▲It's Best Not to Listen to Rumors</p>
<p>▲Parents Don't Know the Reason for Suicide</p>
<p>Song Hongyuan, a native of Ningbo, works at the Cloth Exchange and lives at No. 165, Songbai Li, Meibaige Road. He has three children. The second daughter, Guifeng, is only twenty years old and is the daughter of his second wife, Weng. She is engaged to the Fan family but has not yet married. Suddenly, she secretly took opium the night before last. When her father found out, it was around 4 a.m. yesterday. She was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, she was too poisoned and died yesterday morning. The girl's mother, Weng, was heartbroken at the loss of her beloved daughter. She could not figure out the reason for her suicide. However, Guifeng left two suicide notes to her parents before her death. The original text was erroneous and missing, so it could not be read to the end. Its meaning can be roughly inferred as follows: Dear parents, I heard yesterday that I was going to Xiamen, and I absolutely do not want to go. Because what I hate most in my life is prostitutes. If I were willing to go, then I would have to commit suicide. I don't necessarily want to love freedom, but I listened to Ah Su's words, which made me so painful and made my mother suffer for a lifetime. In the end, it was still empty. When I write here, I am very sad and can't write anymore..." The handwriting in the second half of this letter is more scribbled than before, and the article is incoherent, so the truth is difficult to understand. However, playing with her tone, it seems to say, "It is best for a person not to listen to other people's rumors. Young girls, remember this sentence, otherwise you will be harmed for life like me, and you will also taste the pain of suicide. So I want to advise everyone that rumors and gossip should never be committed." The reporter thought that the original text of this letter was obscure and had a lot to say, so he drove to visit her parents and met Guifeng's father, Song Hongyuan. According to him, his daughter Guifeng died suddenly, and he didn't know the reason. Even her biological mother didn't know the details. In short, his family was unfortunate and suffered this misfortune. He couldn't help sighing. The reporter asked, "Is it true that your daughter is engaged?" Song replied, "My daughter has been engaged to the Fan family. Her fiancé's name is Yinshou, and he lives on Chengdu Road. His father runs the Daxiang Hardware Store on Beijing Road and is also a well-off family." As for my daughter's suicide, it was unexpected. Her mother did tell her not to play mahjong the night before, which is true, but a mother regulating her daughter is also a normal thing in the family, and it should not have caused this tragedy. Moreover, my family has always been strict, and we never let our children act arbitrarily." The reporter asked, "Is it possible that the mother's marriage was not to your daughter's liking?" Song pondered for a while and said, "Perhaps, but I can't say for sure." At this point, Guifeng's mother came out of the廂房 howling, heard the above suicide note, stomped her feet frequently, and called out the nickname of her beloved daughter. As for the words "Ah Su" mentioned in the letter, it was the deceased's sister, who was born to a different mother. The sound of blood and tears was unbearable to hear.</p>
<h3>Lin Weiqing's Wife and Sister Talk About the Kidnapping Experience</h3>
<p>▲The Gatekeeper Is Indeed Suspected</p>
<p>▲The Other Accomplices Are Nowhere to Be Found</p>
<p>Lin Biaoqing, a native of Guangdong and the elder brother of Lin Biaojun, the president of the Jiangsu Higher Court, was kidnapped by bandits at the entrance of his residence at No. 55, Baker Road, at 11:30 p.m. on the 8th of this month, but he escaped unharmed. Later, the Huishan Patrol discovered that Wang Jia Kui, a Shandong native hired by the Lin family as a gatekeeper, was involved in colluding with the bandits in this case, so he was immediately arrested and sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. This has been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xieffen opened a court to interrogate him. According to the lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Patrol, the case is being adjourned, and the bandits have not been found, and it is presumed that they have fled far away. Now there are family members of the victim who can prove the situation at that time. Then, Chen, the wife of Lin Weiqing, complained that at 11 p.m. that night, she, her husband Weiqing, and her sister were returning home by car. When they arrived at the door, the driver honked the horn to ask the defendant to open the door, but he did not respond immediately. The car stopped at the door. Not long after, four bandits suddenly came from the west and broke the car windows. Two bandits beat me, causing injuries to my face, which have not yet healed. Then, the bandits drove the car to the vicinity of the Yili Hotel on Broadway. Because the car engine suddenly broke down and could not be driven, the bandits were afraid of being arrested and fled in panic. I was very panicked at the time, so I could not identify the faces of the bandits. Later, I went to the hotel and asked someone to notify my family to pick me up. According to Ms. Manli, Lin Weiqing's sister, that night, she and her brother and sister-in-law returned home by car. When they arrived at the door, they saw that the doors were tightly closed. When they called the defendant, he did not respond. Then they saw four bandits rushing over and taking her away. I shouted "robbers" in the back, but the car drove very fast and escaped. I reported to the nearby Chinese patrol, etc. According to the driver Cheng A Er, when he drove the car back to the Lin residence at that time, he honked the horn in accordance with the rules to notify the defendant to open the door first. When the car stopped at the door, it had been about two minutes and he still did not see the door open. Suddenly four bandits came, and one bandit托下 me out of the car, threatened with a gun, and was extremely frightened and ran wildly, shouting "robbers". Although the bandit chased dozens of steps, he did not fire a gun. At that time, the sky was dark, so the faces of the bandits could not be identified clearly. When questioned, the defendant stammered and denied colluding with the bandits. After Judge Xiao verified the confession, he ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and adjourned the hearing for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shiming's Concubine and Biological Son's Marriage Problem Dispute</h3>
<p>▲The Biological Mother's Consent Was Not Obtained in Advance</p>
<p>▲A Lawyer Is Now Hired to Apply for Mediation</p>
<p>Zhou Miaoying, the concubine of the late wealthy merchant Zhang Shiming of Nanxun, is now 37 years old. Since Zhang's death, she has lived separately due to disagreements with his wife, Xu. The son she gave birth to, Qu Yan, is 19 years old and has not been living with her. He was raised by Xu. Recently, Qu Yan has grown up, so Xu matched her niece with him as a wife, but Miaoying did not know about it. It was not until the 26th of last month, the date of Qu Yan's marriage, that Miaoying learned about it. Because Qu Yan is her biological son, his marriage must have her consent. Therefore, she hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to publish a warning in the newspaper, recognizing that the marriage was invalid. Later, after mediation by relatives and friends, the amount of money was different by 140,000 yuan, so it broke down. Xu was afraid that Miaoying would go to the wedding hall to make a scene on the due date, so she changed the wedding location to the Hua Mao Hotel on Nanjing Road and held the wedding secretly. Miaoying learned about it and thought that this kind of behavior disregarded the biological mother, so she sought legal solutions. However, the law stipulates that all personal lawsuits must first apply for mediation. Therefore, Miaoying hired two lawyers, Wu Jingxiong, etc., and yesterday filed a petition with the Special District Court to apply for mediation. If the mediation is invalid, then a trial will be conducted.</p>
<h3>Assault and Insult of Two Police Officers</h3>
<p>▲Rice Cake Shop Employee Refuses to Move Coal Stove</p>
<p>▲Shop Owner's Wife Gathers Crowd, Relies on Savagery to Act Fiercely</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 7 o'clock, Zhu Tianhui, police officer No. 1450 from the Xiaobeimen Sub-station, First Precinct, Second District, Nanshi Shenxiangge, was on duty at post No. 20 in the middle section of Luxiangyuan Road, Jiumudi. Suddenly, a shop assistant from Xia Renhe Rice Cake Shop at No. 100 approached and placed a coal stove in the middle of the road, which started a fire. Ashes flew everywhere, and smoke filled the air. The officer, seeing that it was obstructing traffic, immediately stepped forward to direct the assistant to move the stove elsewhere to burn it for the convenience of pedestrians. Unexpectedly, the assistant spoke rudely, causing an argument. The shop owner's wife, upon seeing this, first insulted and scolded the officer, then ordered all the people in the shop to rush out together and surround and beat the officer on the spot. At that time, Police Officer Liu Guojun, standing at the neighboring post No. 33 to the north, was nearby. Hearing the noise, he rushed over, intending to mediate. Unexpectedly, the shop owner's wife, along with many other women, without asking the reason,</p>
<p>grabbed Officer Liu, slapped him several times on the face, struck him several times in the chest, and attempted to seize his firearm and whistle. Officer Liu then loudly called for help. Fortunately, neighboring officers heard the alarm and arrived, detaining the shop owner's wife and two shop assistants, and taking them to the station together. The rest scattered. At that time, Officer Zhu's mouth and head were bleeding profusely, and Officer Liu was severely injured internally. After questioning by Station Chief Wang, the shop owner's wife falsely accused Officer Zhu of attempted extortion that failed, leading to the dispute, etc. However, Station Chief Wang, due to his dismissal today, was unwilling to nitpick and intended to handle the matter leniently, ordering each of the two defendants to be fined two yuan as a warning. At that time, Inspector Jiang Chun shouted and expressed his opinion, roughly stating that if Officer Zhu had engaged in extortion, the shop could report it to the station,</p>
<p>and the station would strictly punish him. The shop should not have taken matters into their own hands and seriously injured the police officer. Furthermore, when neighboring Officer Liu rushed to mediate, the shop owner's wife again assaulted Officer Liu. Therefore, the shop's reliance on savagery, the false accusation of extortion, and the deliberate insult of public officials were very obvious. If the matter were to be handled leniently, police officers exercising their authority outside would completely lose their credibility. Station Chief Wang, left with no choice, ordered them to be remanded in custody pending further investigation. At the same time, Director Chen and Inspector-General Wang Yufen had heard the news and were extremely angry, and immediately dispatched inspectors to investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Marriage of Zhang Shiming's Concubine and Biological Son</h3>
<p>▲Prior Disagreement from the Biological Mother</p>
<p>▲Currently Hiring a Lawyer to Request Mediation</p>
<p>Zhou Miaoying, the concubine of the late Nanzun businessman Zhang Shiming, is currently thirty-seven years old. Since Zhang's death, she has been living separately due to disagreements with Xu, the head wife. Her son, Qu , is nineteen years old and has not lived with her, having been raised by Xu. Recently, as Qu has grown up, Xu arranged for her niece to marry him, without Miaoying's knowledge. It was not until the 26th of last month, the date of Qu 's wedding, that Miaoying learned of it. Because Qu is her biological son, and because such a major event as his engagement should have her consent, she hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to publish a warning in the newspaper, declaring the marriage invalid. Subsequently, relatives and friends mediated, but the amount of money in dispute was a huge amount of 140,000, leading to a breakdown in negotiations. Xu, deeply worried that Miaoying would go to the wedding venue on the day and cause a scene, changed the wedding location to the Hua Ma Hotel on Nanjing Road, holding the wedding in secret. Miaoying learned of this and, feeling that these actions disregarded the biological mother, decided to seek a legal solution. However, legal regulations require that all personal lawsuits must first seek mediation. Therefore, Miaoying hired two lawyers, Wu Jingxiong and others, and yesterday filed a petition with the Special District Court, requesting mediation. If mediation fails, she will proceed with a trial.</p>

<h3>Palace Rongxiang's Bestial Conduct</h3>
<p>▲Received Favor from Maternal Uncle</p>
<p>▲Eloped with Maternal Aunt</p>
<p>▲Returned Home to Demand Property</p>
<p>▲Knife Wounds Mother and Sister</p>
<p>An old woman from Pudong, Gong Xia, residing at No. 2, Lane 389, No. 2, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi, has a son and a daughter. The son, Rongxiang, is 27 years old and does not engage in honest labor, consuming opium. The daughter, Lu Bao, is petite and lovely. Mother and daughter depend on each other for survival. The woman also has some savings, which she intends to entrust to her daughter for support. Therefore, she has long since driven away and ignored this unworthy son who makes no progress. The woman has a younger brother named Xia Jinkun, 38 years old, who lives on Tongguo Road, Zhabei, and works as a painter. His wife, Zhang Zhaodi, is only 23 years old and is his second wife. Xia, seeing that his nephew Rongxiang had been expelled, took him into his home, providing him with food and clothing, and ordering him to quit opium. Unexpectedly, Rongxiang is a beast in human form and made Zhang Zhaodi, his maternal aunt, an object of his love trials. Zhaodi, seeing that her nephew was young, naturally complied. Incest was thus consummated. Last September, they eloped and lived in Yanjiabridge, Pudong. Now, Zhang Zhaodi has encouraged Rongxiang to demand property from his mother, claiming that his mother favors his daughter. The day before yesterday, Rongxiang, armed with a knife, went to his mother's house with Zhaodi to intimidate her. His mother and sister, believing that Rongxiang was a beastly person, also wanted to somehow punish Rongxiang and Zhaodi to appease the mother. This intimidation turned into a reality, with Rongxiang waving the knife wildly. His mother and sister tried to wrest the knife from him. As a result, both his mother and sister's right wrists were cut. At that time, neighbors heard the alarm and rushed over, outraged. They seized Rongxiang and Zhaodi, bound them, and sent them to the Third Sub-station of the First District, where they were handed over to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, they were sent to the District Court, which ordered the defendants to be detained pending punishment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Add an Open-Air Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>▲Already Decided by the Health Committee</p>
<p>The Health Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Settlement has recently decided to spend 50,000 taels to add an open-air swimming pool, in order to alleviate the congestion at the Hongkou Swimming Pool in the summer. The Committee had originally planned to add sand filtration equipment to the existing swimming pool, but estimated that the cost would be 83,000 taels, so it was decided that it would be more economical to build another pool.</p>
<h3>The Portuguese Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Celebrated its Anniversary Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲25th Anniversary of Establishment</p>
<p>The Portuguese Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has been established for twenty-five years. Yesterday, the celebration ceremony began. At 9:15 in the morning, all members, fully armed, gathered at Alban Lane. Led by the military band, they marched in formation to the Hongkou Catholic Church on Nanzun Road for a special prayer. Afterwards, they went to the parade ground of St. Francis Xavier School to hold a commemorative review, awarding long-service medals and taking photographs before dispersing. In the afternoon, they went to the shooting range for a shooting competition. The 25th of this month is the actual anniversary day. It is said that at 5:30 in the afternoon, they will first go to the St. Francis Xavier parade ground for a review, then to the Hongkou Catholic Church for prayer. In the evening, a grand celebratory banquet will be held. On Saturday night, the 28th, there will be a dance party at the Atlantic Association to conclude the celebrations.</p>
<h3>Zhao Shouyu's Determination to Promote National Products</h3>
<p>▲Resigned as Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi</p>
<p>▲Dedicated to Industrial Work</p>
<p>Zhao Shouyu, the Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi, entered the capital from Shanghai last year and once visited the National Products Mall founded by Zhang Zilian. He greatly admired Zhang's enthusiasm for promoting national products, not fearing dangers and moving forward courageously. Furthermore, he believed that Zhang's move was of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood and encouraged him to work hard. Last month, Zhang entered the capital and again presented his plan to Zhao Shouyu, earnestly requesting</p>
<h3>Zhao Shouyu</h3>
<p>to take on the leadership and preside over everything. Zhao, believing that promoting national products was essential to Premier Sun's grand plan of saving the country through industry, agreed to consider it. Recently, he came to Shanghai and discussed the matter with Zhang in detail, expressing his determination. He will personally go to Shanxi in the coming days to hand over the military to the authorities and prepare to resign from all his concurrent positions in the government to formally join the National Products Mall. This is truly good news for implementing the plan of saving the country through industry after national unification.</p>
<h3>What Was Heard in the Investigation of the Dalun Real Estate Case</h3>
<p>▲The High Court Branch Requested Examples</p>
<p>▲The Chamber of Commerce Replied that it Was Not a Business Custom</p>
<p>Regarding the retrial of the real estate dispute case of Dalun Real Estate Company, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce asking about the custom of terminating leases of indefinite-term houses in the settlement. The Chamber of Commerce replied that there was no fixed custom. Subsequently, the Second Branch stated that the Chamber of Commerce's reply did not match the purpose of the investigation and sent another letter. The Chamber of Commerce replied again. The two letters are recorded as follows: (1) Original Letter from the Second Branch of the High Court, respectfully opening: Your association's letter has been approved. Our court is investigating the habit of vacating and re-trying the case of Laoda House and Dalun Real Estate Company. It is approved. Our court instructed that you investigate the custom of terminating indefinite-term houses in the settlement. The focus is on listing examples. Now, the reply is purely an opinion of the meeting discussion and did not give examples. This does not match the purpose of the investigation. Correspondently, we ask your association to give the results of several important examples of the customary practices in the settlement over the years (such as how a house with no fixed term was recovered). Reply to our court to confirm public friendship. This is addressed to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. (2) Reply from Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully opening: On the sixteenth of this month, we received a letter from your branch, stating that our association's reply to the investigation of the Laoda House and Dalun Real Estate Company vacate and re-try case was purely the opinion of a meeting discussion, did not give examples, and did not match the purpose of the investigation. We requested that you list the results of several important examples of the customary practices in the settlement over the years and reply to our court, etc. It was discussed at the 32nd Standing Committee meeting of our association on the 20th of this month. It was unanimously agreed that the Chamber of Commerce should follow the laws and regulations and the duties of the Chamber of Commerce in responding to the consultations of government offices. Matters should be limited to commercial matters and commercial customs. The point of contention in this case is the issue of the owner of a house recovering the house for rent. This falls within the scope of current civil law regulations. The examples consulted by the court are also civil cases, not commercial customs. Therefore, our previous letter stated that there was no fixed custom in terms of commerce. We truthfully replied to the court. The draft was submitted to the twelfth Executive Committee for approval and reply. Correspondently, we record the case and reply. We ask you to investigate.</p>
<h3>Actively Preparing the Improved Fishery Propaganda Conference</h3>
<p>▲March 28 to April 3</p>
<p>▲Holding an Expanded Week of Propaganda</p>
<p>Riri News stated that the coastal fishing areas of China have repeatedly suffered from Japanese fishing boats trespassing and illegally fishing. Every year, countless rights are lost. Although there are many Chinese people who are paying attention, it is still difficult to see many protesting. The reason for this is that China's fishing industry is not developed enough, so all fishing areas are not caught, which allows foreigners to trespass. In view of this, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau have initiated the Improved Fishery Propaganda Conference, starting with the promotion of the fishing industry, as the fundamental way to oppose foreign trespassing and illegal fishing.

<h3>Soviet Russia Launches General Educational Mobilization</h3>
<p>▲This is a large-scale and radical literacy movement</p>
<p>丨Proceeding Simultaneously with Economic Mobilization丨</p>
<p>▲Requires 482,000 Teachers</p>
<p>World News Agency, Moscow: The current urgent task of Soviet Russia is the development of the national economy, and the fundamental requirement for the implementation of the Five-Year Plan is the popularization of national education. This is the reason for the recent general educational mobilization in Soviet Russia. The so-called general educational mobilization is a large-scale and radical literacy movement. The Central Ministry of Education has ordered all educational institutions of the Soviets to mobilize and actively carry out literacy campaigns to popularize compulsory education. Last year, compulsory education was limited to the first level of primary schools, and 11.6 million people received education. By the middle of this year, it is planned to implement compulsory education for children aged 11 and 12, with a number of more than 3 million. Children in seven-year primary schools (2 million) and children in first-level primary schools (14.22 million) are also within the scope of the compulsory education implementation plan. Compared to last year, the number of people receiving compulsory education has increased by 44 percent. The important goal of this year's general educational mobilization is to provide rapid education to young people aged 15 to 11, thereby eliminating illiterate citizens. As for workers and within the Party, they have also been universally educated. The number of teachers required for the general educational mobilization is estimated at 482,000. Intellectuals among Party members will all serve as teachers, proceeding simultaneously with the economic mobilization of the Five-Year Plan. The whole country is quite lively, it is said.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Experts from the Chinese Vocational Education Society in Suzhou (1)</h3>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society holds an expert meeting once a year. This year's spring meeting is scheduled for the 21st and 22nd in Suzhou. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Meeting on the First Day</p>
<p>▲Attendees: Cai Yuanpei, Hu Chunzao, Gu Yinting, Leng Yuqiu, Liu Zhanen, Wang Diancun, Liao Nanfang, Pan Jiqing, Wu Guanghan, Wang Zhixin, Pan Yinge, Gao Xiaonong, Jiang Wenyu, Huang Renzhi, Shen Gongjian, Chen Qingshi, Pan Qingyao, Yao Huiquan, Wu Cuilun, Huang Puqi, Zhao Wu, Jia Foru, Yang Weiyu, Lei Binnan, Huang Qisheng, Huang Zhuming, Wang Xingchi, Gu Junyi, Wu Tingyang, Wang Boxuan, Gu Jingqing, Huang Yun shen,</p>
<p>▲Opening of the Meeting: On the morning of the 20th, the attendees had arrived at the Suzhou Garden Hotel one after another. At noon, County Magistrate Wang Yunseng, Qiao Xunong of the Social Survey Office, and local resident Zhang Zhongren hosted a public banquet at the hotel. After the meal, they went to Liuyuan Garden, and the meeting was called to order at 2:15 p.m. Cai Yuanpei, Hu Shuhua, and Liu Zhanen were elected as the presidium. First, Jiang Wenyu reported on the proposals, including five items related to industry and commerce, nine items related to rural areas, ten items related to vocational guidance, five items related to supplementary education, ten items related to the promotion of vocational education, and six items related to women's vocational issues. He also suggested whether the Society should appoint a committee to draft a declaration to draw attention to all parties and clarify the Society's purpose. Liu Zhanen and Zhang Zhongren stood up one after another and said that the experts had taken time out to come to Suzhou, and some had to leave Suzhou that evening. Therefore, they requested that opinions be expressed first before discussing the proposals, and that all problems be resolved tomorrow. The public had no objection. Then, Gu Shusen, the Director of the Ministry of Education, made a statement. Director Gu said that according to the recent statistics of the Ministry, there are a total of 1,139 secondary schools, of which 147 are vocational schools, accounting for only 11 percent. There are a total of 234,811 students, of which 16,641 are vocational students, accounting for only 7 percent. The Ministry had a proposal that provinces should no longer establish more ordinary secondary schools, but increase vocational schools. This is currently being submitted to the Central Political Conference. The Ministry is addressing the lack of vocational school regulations in the past and is preparing to propose six points for the experts to discuss. 1. Primary and secondary schools may add vocational courses as needed by the locality. 2. There are very few national supplementary education schools. How should the outline be determined? 3. In the school system regulations, the vocational schools next to secondary schools are only four. 4. The courses in various secondary vocational schools were previously scaled-down university courses, which are not appropriate and must be improved to be practical. There are agricultural, industrial, and commercial departments, but there is no attention paid to the distribution of specific vocational courses and the number of years. 5. The Ministry has ordered the provincial departments and bureaus to pay attention to vocational guidance methods. How should this be promoted? 6. Vocational teacher issues: Without adequate talent, the business will not succeed. Where do teachers come from? How to train them is the first problem. Today, I am attending in a private capacity and ask the experts for detailed instructions so that I can report to the Ministry for improvement. Huang Renzhi said that the six major issues have included various proposals and can be roughly classified and summarized into three items, and then the discussion methods can be determined. That is, vocational supplementary education and vocational guidance should be independent, and the rest should be discussed in a common way. The method of discussion should be to recommend experts with practical experience to conduct separate research in practical industries. If there are no suitable experts, it is better to have none. As for the six major issues, Zhang Zhongren proposed that they be printed by the Society for detailed discussion tomorrow (the 21st). Then, Liu Zhanen said that time is limited, please follow the previous method, everyone should express their opinions as accurately as possible, and limit it to three minutes. The public agreed. Then, in succession, speeches were given until after 5:00 p.m., when photos were taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education, based on Chen Changwu's request to establish an industrial school to provide relief to unemployed youth, (plans to establish industrial schools modeled on European and American practices, and the class time should be stipulated so as not to conflict with the current working hours. All faculty and staff will be temporarily concurrently held by existing faculty and staff, and a reasonable travel allowance will be given. Efforts should be made to reduce the cost of each student's tuition, so that the government can educate a large number of talents with very little expenditure. In the future, when construction flourishes, there will be no shortage of supply. Moreover, all unemployed youth can be self-reliant and self-taught, regardless of class or wealth, and there will be no sigh of unemployment. The Ministry of Education's reply stated that, according to the report, young people are forced to make a living and unemployment is a cause for concern, and that remedial education should be provided to promote talent.

In order to attract the attention of citizens, the bureau organized a large-scale literacy campaign and recreational event every day. On the first day, the Youth Propaganda Corps had a new vernacular drama, the Righteous Beggars of the Comrades Society, Wu Qi, and Han Langen's one-legged show, and performances from Wuben, Wanzhu, Feihong, and other schools, all of which had deep implications for the literacy campaign. On the second day, at the Central Auditorium, in addition to the programs from the first day, there was also a performance by the uneducated women of Peiming Girls' School, music from the Family Music Society, and the Land of Happiness from Shanggong School. Today is the last day, and it is said to be held at the YMCA. The program is recorded as follows: (1) The Pain of Illiteracy (Feihong); (2) Sister's Mistake (Wuben); (3) Still Time (Tangwan); (4) Righteous Beggar Wu Qi (Vernacular New Drama Comrades Society); (5) Playing the Pipa (Datong Music Society); (6) One-Legged Show (Han Langen); (7) Land of Illiteracy (Peiming Girls' School); (8) Little Painter (Hubbei); (9) Dance (Patriotic); (10) Beijing Tune (Patriotic); (11) Song (Youth Propaganda Corps).</p>

In addition to the science museum already in the College of Science and the research rooms already established in the Colleges of Arts and Education, the Colleges of Law and Commerce, the Middle School Department, and the Party Doctrine Research Room should also be added. The Middle School Department is exclusively for teachers. University education is not only about lectures and absorption between teachers and students, but also about focusing on research and making new inventions and contributions to the academic world of the country and the world. During the meeting, they also discussed building another Western-style building to be used exclusively as a research room. The school's efforts in culture are truly commendable.</p>

<h3>Western Football Club Scored Ten Goals in Yesterday's Match Against Zhenru</h3>
<p>丨Lehua Fought with Ten Men丨</p>
<p>▲They Deserved to Fall to the Ground</p>
<p>The Lehua football team lost to Zhenru by a score of 10-0 yesterday. Looking at Zhenru's lineup, it was not the most perfect, but Lehua only had seven players, and three players were temporarily pulled in to make up ten players to fight. Not only could they not defeat the enemy and achieve success, but it was not easy for the striker to cross the center line. In the second half, they only fought with nine players, with Yang Renwei and Chen Yutian as strikers, and the rest strictly guarded the goal, not taking a step out. Although Zhenru's army won ten goals, they did not see each other exerting their intelligence and effort. If they worked hard, the number of goals would not be limited to this. Because Zhou Xianyan was in Hong Kong, Lu Zhongen was originally scheduled to serve yesterday, but because Lu was unable to attend due to something, Qian Yaobin had to be pulled in to take over. Qian was not an expert in this field, so it was difficult for him to perform his duties, resulting in one mistake after another, which led to a big mistake.</p>
<h3>The Ground Was Slippery and the Competition Was Lax</h3>
<p>The competitive situation was lax, and the ground was slippery, so there was nothing exciting to say. Because Lehua realized that the front line was incomplete, the entire army retreated to the rear. Zhenru surrounded the goal from beginning to end, like a barrage of gunfire. Chen Yutian of Lehua occasionally volunteered once or twice and charged in alone, but he was unable to do anything because one hand cannot clap. He was cut back halfway and could not get close to the goal. What a pity.</p>
<p>▲New General, Luo Haiguang</p>
<p>In the first half, Zhenru scored six goals in total. The order in which they scored is as follows: (1) Chen Zhenhe, (2) Luo Haiguang, (3) Luo Haiguang, (4) Chen Zhenhe, (5) Luo Haiguang, (6) Luo Haiguang. In the second half, they scored four goals: (7) Chen Zhenhe, (8) Chen Jiaqiu, (9) Luo Haiguang, (10) Chen Bingxiang. In total, Luo Haiguang scored five goals alone. Luo's footwork was very strong, he was tireless from beginning to end, and he swept across Lehua's goal, showing no signs of fatigue. He is indeed a promising rising star. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing.</p>

<h3>Interesting Stories During the Unemployment Panic in the United States by Qiu Shui</h3>
<p>The unemployment panic has recently spread to various countries, which is unfortunate. Why call it interesting? However, recently I read a foreign newspaper and saw several trivial matters recorded about the unemployment panic in the United States, which were extremely interesting, and the degree of their interest was not diminished by the unemployment. I will record them here.</p>
<p>▲ Police Officers Acting as Wet Nurses New York has always been a place full of factories, and tens of millions of people depend on them for their livelihood. Since the overproduction economic crisis occurred, factories everywhere have been closing down day by day, and the general workers have been declared unemployed. As a result of unemployment, the source of economic income is cut off, and they are struggling to take care of themselves, let alone their children. Therefore, some people abandoned their newborn babies on the side of the road. When the police saw them, they had no way to return them to their mothers, so they had to temporarily keep them in the police station and buy milk to feed them. When people came to the police station to visit, they saw dozens of babies in one room, sitting in the arms of the on-duty police officers, holding milk bottles to suckle. The police officers were very busy for a while, and the supply of milk bottles on the market could not meet the demand. Unemployed workers with newborn children deliberately abandoned them on the side of the road, waiting for the police officers to come and adopt them to reduce their burden. As a result, the police station was overcrowded and did not know what to do.</p>
<p>▲ The Rogue Emperor Showed Great Kindness People of the middle class, or those who are still considered to be well-off, seeing the plight of unemployed workers, emptied their pockets to help them, to maintain their lives and to ensure the stability of society. It is common to see wealthy families prepare a special room in their kitchens to provide food for the unemployed. They go there on time, and no one is refused. Moreover,</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Sun Baoqi - Name: Shu</h3>
<p>▲ During the Qing Dynasty When Mu Lao was serving as the Governor of Shandong, in the first year, the people's army rose up. The court was in a panic. Mu Lao sent a telegram requesting his retirement, which shocked the entire court and reversed the situation, and Shandong was able to be preserved. He had such a thorough understanding of the overall situation.</p>
<p>▲ During the Hongxian Era Mu Lao served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Yuan trusted him as a member of his clique. One day, Yuan summoned Mu to the palace (at that time, the Beiyang Army had defeated the people's army) and showed him the abdication edict of the Qing Dynasty, saying, "I was ordered by the Qing Dynasty to lead the country. Now that the military situation is stable, I can return the jade tablet to Zhao." Mu knew his intentions and strongly stated that the imperial system could not be restored. Yuan left in anger. Another day, Yuan went to the Senate to reiterate his previous statement. Mu refused again. Yuan was displeased. As a result, the position of Secretary of State was given to Xu Donghai instead of Sun and Mu and Han. This was the main reason. He was unwilling to be obsequious.</p>
<p>▲ During Cao Kun's Era When Cao was in power, he needed talent to assist him. He thought that Mu Lao could be deceived with his methods and enticed him with official positions. When he controlled the cabinet members, he implemented a dictatorial system. In the end, he was embarrassed by the opposition to the Gold Franc case. Cao knew Fan Shu's poverty and gave him money for the end of the year. Mu Lao refused to accept it and thanked him. He was truly incorruptible.</p>
<h3>World News Briefs by Hai Ke</h3>
<p>▲ American Dyke State has many rattlesnakes. If a person is bitten, they will suffer extremely severe poisoning. Now, people are using poisonous gas to deal with them, forcing them to hide in their nests and not come out again.</p>
<p>▲ During the European War, the British Admiralty made a special large lifebuoy. Each ring can supply fifty people. Now, bathers in the Thames River are using such large lifebuoys as water games.</p>

<p>There are those who collect the wealth of the people to create a soup kitchen. Chicago is the most particular about this. Three meals a day are provided free of charge, and this has been going on for several months. When people ask about the source of its economy, no one can answer. However, according to rumors, this is presided over by Red-Faced Kepo. Red-Faced Kepo is the Rogue Emperor of American society. He does all kinds of evil on weekdays and possesses tens of millions of assets. Because his face is red, he is known as Red-Faced. Today, he has made this great act of charity. This is the so-called robber showing kindness. In addition, stores also sometimes operate charitable businesses, or designate a certain day to a certain day, and donate a few points of the price of the goods sold to the soup kitchen to save the workers. At the same time, they also publish large advertisements to attract customers. Fruit merchants have even more whimsical ideas, recruiting unemployed workers to act as hawkers along the way. Workers can earn wages and use them for food and clothing. The sales of fruits outside are branded with unemployed workers, and sales have increased greatly. The owner's income is far greater than the loss. The calculation is also clever.</p>
<h3>Witty People and Witty Things by Jiang Liusheng</h3>
<p>▲ Bodhisattva Former President Li Huangpi once said, "Everyone eats when there is rice." Therefore, people praised him as a "Bodhisattva." Unexpectedly, a Bodhisattva has now appeared again, namely Mr. Pan Yangyao, the director of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center. People generally call him that. Although the name is close to superstition, the meaning is indeed very appropriate. Pan has never refused anyone who asks him for a job. He has the principle of granting whatever is requested, and he always promises in advance to do his best to find a way. I remember one day the year before last, Pan went to a large library at the request of a certain gentleman to visit its manager. At that time, the manager was afraid of working and also knew Pan's intention, so he just politely perfunctorily to prevaricate. However, Pan sat for a long time without leaving, and remained calm. The manager couldn't bear it and finally set up a position. Pan then said goodbye and left. Afterwards, people thanked Mr. Pan with the title of Bodhisattva. That is to praise his virtue.</p>
<p>▲ Comedian European and American comedy movie stars, such as Charlie Chaplin and Locke, are all called "comedians." Now I am talking about an Eastern comedian. This person is none other than Mr. Fei Wenbao, who was mentioned in the 20th issue's "May Fourth and Revolution." Fei has not only repeatedly written witty sketches in this publication, evoking laughter, but also often produces jokes in his conversation. I remember last summer when the Commodities Exchange celebrated its anniversary, it held a carnival cruise abroad on the New Baohua. Fei was also pestered by the crowd to go on stage and tell jokes and anecdotes. Every word and every sentence was wonderful to the extreme. The listeners all burst out laughing. This person's skill is truly not inferior to Wang Yuneng and Jiang Xiaoxiao.</p>
<h3>Excerpts from Reading Sounds</h3>
<p>Li Xufan</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau has been promoting the national calendar with all its might. It has revised the disciplinary measures and repeatedly ordered all schools to prohibit the early or late closure of schools during the period before and after February 17th, considering schools as factories for creating a new culture and the places where students gather. They should follow the orders and urge society to switch to the national calendar. On this day, except for the schools in the British and French concessions, where some classes were suspended, all schools in the Chinese area held classes as usual. In the Ximen area, such as Meixi, Xiqu, Huxi, Dyeing Industry, and Tangwan Elementary Schools, the teachers had repeatedly advised the students in advance, and the general students were able to brave the snow and cold to carry their schoolbags to school without any absences. Most of the students in a certain school on Fangbang Bridge are children of shopkeepers. Society is accustomed to the old customs and still closes its doors and suspends business. Also, because they did not sleep the night before, most of them had already fallen asleep, which affected the students' absence from school. A certain principal, seeing that the students were as rare as the morning stars, was afraid of hindering the decree, so he hurriedly came up with a clever idea and ordered the teachers to go out in all directions and visit each family to implement a draft-style work and force them to go to school so that he could get by. The general parents all called the teacher a prankster.</p>
<p>Another two schools, because more than half of the students were absent on this day, could not teach in separate grades, so they could only live in one room. The teachers took turns on stage to tell stories, one up and one down, for three consecutive class periods, like the storytelling in the Chaihang Hall Deyilou in the city.</p>
<p>A certain girls' middle school in the Chinese area was very enthusiastic about reading. Because there were not enough people, they did not teach new lessons but reviewed them. Several lively and beautiful students actually carried poker cards, dice, and other toys and entertained themselves in the classroom without permission. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was discovered by the staff. They insisted on punishing them by name. After many students pleaded for mercy, saying it was a new year and a new year, please forgive them. The matter was then dropped.</p>
<h3>Record of the Destruction of Ancient Stone Relics</h3>
<p>Ma Dunying</p>
<p>In my hometown, there are two mountains of stone. There are many ancient miracles. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, they have gradually been buried. It is truly a pity. Last winter, I returned to my hometown and took a ten-day tour with friends. Unexpectedly, several relics, such as the Lianli Pine, were lost again. Therefore, I record them.</p>
<p>Lianli Pine On the top of Shenshan, there are two ancient pines. The branches and trunks are combined into one, so it is called Lianli. The leaves are lush and look like a canopy from afar. It stands alone on the top of the mountain, enduring the cold. It is truly a spectacle. It was stolen and sold by unscrupulous people the year before last. The villagers have not heard of anyone being held accountable. ▲ Vajra Statue At the foot of Zivi Mountain, there is a large temple. The temple is called Huili. The incense is very prosperous. The Vajra statue in the Toushan Gate is extremely majestic and unparalleled. It is said to have been sculpted by famous craftsmen during the Tang and Song dynasties. In recent times, it has become a rare sight. In the spring of Dingmao, a huge fire broke out in Xintai, and the Vajra Hall was also affected. What a pity.</p>
<p>▲ Palindrome Wall The palindrome wall is on the side of the Huili Temple. According to research, its age should be above the Tang and Song dynasties. The bricks are stacked like reed mats. The year before last, a Westerner saw it and was surprised by it. He took a photo and kept a record. According to the elders, it was made by immortals. Later, due to the reconstruction of the Huili Temple, this wall was also demolished.</p>
<p>▲ Qingluo Pond Qingluo Pond is located north of Henggang Bridge. The pond</p>
<p>The water is clear and is also one of the ancient stone relics. There is a tragic story in it. During the Hong Yang Rebellion, bandits in the vicinity rose up. Two brothers, Zhou Qi and Zhou Ba, were brave and strong and defended their hometown. They died in street battles. Their families also died in this pond. The year before last, the Shen family hired workers to build a house, and this pond was also filled in.</p>
<p>The above four ancient relics, I often visit them every time I return to my hometown. Now that they have been destroyed, I can't help but feel sad and sentimental. I have also heard that other ancient relics have also been destroyed. From now on, the two mountains will inevitably be less beautiful. I hope the people in the village will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>▲ Short News The novelist Yan Fusun invented gourd fortune-telling. He has set up his desk for five years, and his judgments are miraculous. Now, because the original site of the Hulu Wenjin office on Er Ma Road is not enough to display, it has been moved to No. 433, Lane 1, Yixin Lane, opposite the New World in the north of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road. Fortune-telling is open as usual. Out-of-town letters can also be answered. Mr. Yan has been ill for a long time and has returned to his hometown to recuperate. He has recently returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Publishing News The works of the famous novelist Zhang Qiuchong are elegant, humorous, and bizarre. His long social novel "New Shan Hai Jing" is the most recent masterpiece. In the summer, the Xiangbao Publishing House ordered 1,000 copies to be used for preferential treatment of subscribers. Now the period has expired. There are still dozens of copies left. I would like to offer them at a low price. This book has 500,000 words and a total of five thick volumes. The price is five yuan. Now only the cost is recovered, two yuan per copy. Consignment location: No. 49 and a half, Wuzhuang Road, He Tieshan's medical residence. Zhang Zhenyu drew the cover. Lu Shaofei drew the illustrations. Five-color Han silver is extremely gorgeous.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (214)</h3>
<p>22nd. Yu Wenbao, the principal of the Overseas Chinese Public School, came to visit and invited me to visit his school. He asked me about the images of the Spanish couple hanging in the school. They donate a lot of money to the school every year. This Spaniard is engaged in commerce and has friendship with the Chinese.</p>
<p>23rd. Mr. Liu Buli sent his nephew to take me by car to see the Burmese ball club. It rained heavily and was muddy that day. I entered the stadium and bought a second-class ticket. Half a shield per person. It was a wide grassy field with a shed set up for the audience. There were many men and women watching outside the stadium. There were also some Westerners. It was drizzling. People said that in Southeast Asia, it is better to play ball on rainy days to avoid the heat. On this day, Burmese people from schools in distant places came to compete with students from Pathein. I asked a person, how do Burmese students play ball compared to Chinese? He replied that they were not as good. After watching the game for about two hours, I saw the children spinning around in the mud, each striving to bring glory to their goal. This kind of game is only suitable for men. It is not suitable for women. Rolling, falling, and wrestling are all brave for strength. I also don't want to watch this loach life group. But if I were to use troops, it would be appropriate to attack on a windy, rainy, or snowy night. But in the end, all these acts of fighting are not civilized. Because I think of Confucius saying. In ancient times, shooting did not focus on the hide. But now it is not the case. The decline of the Spring and Autumn period was gradually heavy. Today is a complete era of power. A world of male hair. If this fighting spirit is not eliminated, how can we hope for peace? Tuo Erye Taichu liked shooting and hunting. Then regret it. According to the ball game movement, it has become a big problem in this world. In my opinion, the descendants of the capitalist class have too much surplus interest. So there is畸形education. The noble game. If you really develop your physical strength. It is best to use Tuo Weng's educational method. Fundamentally overthrow the noble-style education curriculum. Add labor and arm work lessons. Avoid tempting disciples. For this unproductive homework. Wasting money. It has now become a ball-raising world of labor. If it is sacred and inviolable. It is also a strange phenomenon of capital　餘. Those who are generally attached to capital and run education. How can you know this? Replace it with Tuo's educational method. If you say that fighting the ball increases strength, it is better than Tuo's use of his son to cut wood and carry soldiers. In the past, Wei Zhong (a German) ran a school in the north. Students make shoes and mud walls. I thought this was better than the ball game of education under capitalism</p>
<p>24th. Received a post from Liu Fangyi. Please go to Cangbang. Sunboon is Liu Qingyun's mother's 70th birthday. I can also take this opportunity to travel to the countryside. At 3:00 p.m., I boarded a small wheel with many people. Two yuan per person. Arrived at 9:00 a.m. the next day. Completely countryside. There are dozens of Burmese families. Chinese families greet guests. To show welcome. They opened a store. Under a big tree by the river. It is a big thatched house. And there are many guests. All arrived by boat. A total of sixteen tables. There are more than a hundred people. A thatched shed for a birthday costs one or two thousand yuan. There are several Chinese stores here. All sell groceries. The outside is a thatched hut. But the inside is very solid. The business is not small. The shadows of the trees by the river. The Burmese women's water is very impressive. Visited a Burmese primary school. In a square house. Very difficult to describe. Bamboo is used as the floor. Under the board are more than ten boys. A large one holds a slate to teach the small one. I didn't see the teacher. The Burmese live in cement. The women's clothes are decorated like Shanghai people. They don't pay attention to the house. The rich don't moisten the house.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introductions</p>
<h3>The Vanguard Weekly Left</h3>
<p>Issue 27 to 30</p>
<p>The nationalistic literary movement has become the main trend in the Chinese literary world, and the Vanguard Weekly is the source of this main trend, the most forward-looking force in this main trend. It has become an indelible fact. Indeed, anyone who knows a little about the recent situation of the Chinese literary world, anyone who has a little contact with literature, who doesn't know that there is a Vanguard Weekly, who doesn't know that the Vanguard Weekly has already achieved considerable success and reputation? However, since everyone already knows, why do I want to introduce it again? That is entirely because the newspaper has recently become more perfect and more profound.</p>
<p>What I want to introduce is the 27th to 30th issues of the newspaper, which are the first and most recent four issues of the Vanguard after half a year of publication. The previous half-year 26 issues were edited by Mr. Li Jinxuan, who devoted all his efforts to establishing the central consciousness and theory of literature and art. Unfortunately, Mr. Li was unable to continue to be responsible due to illness, so Mr. Zheng Xiaojia was responsible for editing. What I want to introduce is the most perfect and most brilliant product after Mr. Zheng Xiaojia's editing.</p>
<p>These four issues, except for two orphans, which is a long translated novel that continues from the previous issue and is unfinished, are all short and wonderful works. There are a longer essay on the relationship between nation and literature, short stories "Hope", "Cold Night", "An Annamese Friend", "Cavalry Patrolman", etc. There are four articles, three poems "The Light of Slaves", "A Line", and "Pre-War Song", and eight articles of criticism and Tanfeng. Each article has made significant progress compared to the previous ones, and will be briefly introduced one by one in order to make readers more clear and understand the content and true face of the newspaper.</p>
<p>The article "The Relationship between Nation and Literature" is divided into three sections. The first section is the anatomy of literature, which explains the essence of literature from the three fundamental elements of literature: me, what I say, and the person I speak to. The second section is in a nation, the relationship between literary elements and the nation to explain the national concept. The third section is, is there so-called class literature, to prove the shortcomings of proletarian literature and the impossibility of existence from the position of the nation. The whole article has a unified point of view and factual basis, and it is a powerful work. I will make a more detailed discussion in another article when I have time.</p>
<p>The four short stories are written from the same standpoint, with nationalism as the central consciousness. "Hope" writes about the future hope aroused by the overseas Chinese returning from Southeast Asia seeing the imperialist aggression everywhere. "Cold Night" writes about a lonely young man avenging his father, which is actually fighting and sacrificing for the entire nation. "An Annamese Friend" writes about a story of an Annamese student in France who was induced by a French government detective and fell into depravity. "Cavalry Patrolman" writes about the Japanese aggression in the three northeastern provinces and the struggle and struggle of the Chinese nation. Each article has a complete structure and a light description. Among them, I especially like "Hope" and "Cavalry Patrolman", because they give me a more profound image and more stimulation. I can guarantee that if anyone wants to find a little excitement, a little new stimulation, then reading these two short works will definitely get considerable satisfaction.</p>
<p>The poem "The Light of Slaves" was written by Yi Kang for sending the black man Washington back to the United States, and it is worth reading. "A Line" and "Pre-War Song" are also full of calls for the nation to rise up and the magnificent and enthusiastic emotions. Now let's record a shorter one, "A Line", where you can find the true meaning of poetry with nationalism as the central consciousness.</p>
<p>A Line</p>
<p>A line of people are taken away in the boundless night,</p>
<p>Advance bravely, each of us,</p>
<p>This is not the time for us to rest,</p>
<p>The rain is raging, the wind is roaring,</p>
<p>Rescue ourselves from the bloodbath,</p>
<p>Take the opportunity to rush forward,</p>
<p>The flag is fluttering, the flute is urging,</p>
<p>A line of people broke through the enemy's camp,</p>
<p>Here, there, killing them without a return,</p>
<p>Step over these corpses,</p>
<p>Blood is splashing, knives are flying,</p>
<p>The white dawn is a sign of the day,</p>
<p>A line of people walked over the mountain,</p>
<p>Singing with all the sounds,</p>
<p>The night is fleeing, the chicken is breaking dawn,</p>
<p>Now let's talk about Tanfeng inside, which doesn't need</p>
<p>Too much introduction, and no explanation is needed. Facts have already proved that it is a short and powerful blade. It is useless to say it yourself. Please look at the words of the Nanjing Literary Monthly,</p>
<p>"...There are often some "Tanfeng", which attack speculative, talismanic, and slogan-like literature, which is quite effective."</p>
<p>But I am very sorry that I can no longer use the length of the article to quote the original text as a factual proof. But I think people who have read the newspaper must be deeply convinced.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese Anti-Left Wing Literary Great Unity is a very good introduction article, and everyone who cares about the literary world should read it.</p>
<p>In short, the newspaper can recognize the goal, establish a literary foundation with nationalism as the central consciousness, and open up a bright path in the chaotic, speculative, and blind Chinese literary world, which is very worthy of our admiration and attention. Now, at the beginning of a new struggle, when everything is improving rapidly, it is even more worthy and should be paid attention to by us. So friends, please don't hesitate, you should buy and read the 27th to 30th issues of the Vanguard, it will definitely give you a satisfactory result.</p>
<h3>Record of Engineering Construction: Zhang Yanxiang</h3>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>A Brief Account of the Construction of the New Electric Plant by Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity Company (Author: Yu Yinqi, Electrical Engineering, Volume 1, Number 4, November, Republic of China Year 19, Pages 426-436, Publisher: Electrical Engineering Magazine Society within the College of Engineering of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou)</p>
<p>The new electric plant of Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has been successfully constructed and began generating electricity in December. It has two 10,000-kilowatt turbine generators and one 500-kilowatt generator, along with three boilers each with a heating surface area of 800 square meters, making it the largest self-operated electric plant in China. The author, an engineer at the company, provides detailed information on (1) the company's history, (2) the construction and machinery of the electric plant site, (3) the power distribution methods, (4) the total relay pressure station, and (5) the routes, accompanied by eight illustrations. The arrangement of the machinery and the wiring system are particularly clear. The plant is located on Jun Gong Road, Jiansong Bridge, on the Huangpu River, occupying more than 30 mu (approximately 5 acres). The construction of the plant building was divided into pile driving, foundation work, and building construction, each contracted out to construction companies. The piles were cement piles, 42 feet long, capable of bearing 39 tons, totaling 395 piles, which is noteworthy. The boiler steam pressure reaches as high as 40 atmospheres, equivalent to 590 pounds per square inch, three times the commonly used pressure, making it the highest pressure used domestically. The steam consumption is only 4.03 kilograms per kilowatt-hour, equivalent to 8.87 pounds. There are also various ancillary equipment, such as water heaters, evaporators, water supply condensers, and air filters, all planned according to the scale of the world's latest large electric plants. The generator voltage is 6,600 volts, and the transmission voltage is 33,000 volts. The transformers use both oil and water double cooling methods, with two units, each with a capacity of 12,500 kVA, which is also the largest capacity in China today. The step-down transformers use four single-phase units, with three in common use and one as a spare for replacement. The 33,000-volt high-voltage lines are overhead three-wire systems, supported by iron towers and iron poles. The poles are divided into six styles, 50 feet and 60 feet high. Detailed drawings, materials, and cost values are all included in the article. The route from the power plant to the first transformer station on Liuying Road is 8,730 meters long, and the route from the first transformer station to the second transformer station on North Zhongshan Road in Caojiadu is 6,088 meters long. This 33,000-volt high voltage, in our country, is only used by Qishuyan Electric Plant aside from this case. The plant has a capital of four million yuan, and the value of the machinery and the contracted construction costs are recorded in detail in the article. This plant can be said to be a major construction in the electrical industry of the Republic of China in the year 19.</p>
<p>Capital Ferry (Far East Times (English), Volume 26, Number 12, December, Republic of China Year 19, Pages 669-673, Publisher: Far East Times, 24 Huangpu Bund, Shanghai) The Capital Ferry is a plan to connect the Jinpu and Jinghu Railways, and the Ministry of Railways has started construction. According to the high and low water levels of the Yangtze River in Nanjing varying by as much as 24 feet throughout the year, and even differing by as much as 3 feet daily, the design is relatively difficult. The ferry is prepared to cope with a water level difference of 28 feet. The ferry has three rows of rails, each 300 feet long, capable of carrying 21 freight cars (each 42 feet long, weighing 40 tons each) or 12 passenger cars (each 72 feet long). Four bridges are being built on each bank of the dock, protruding into the river, which can be raised and lowered to match the water level. Each bridge is 150 feet long, with a 20-foot-long movable disc at the end, prepared for the rise and fall of buoyancy due to increased or decreased load when vehicles drive on and off. Locomotives can drive onto the ferry by themselves, and the wheels can be loaded and unloaded using the electric motors provided on the ferry, or they can be pushed and pulled from the shore using winches. The article includes six illustrations, providing a general understanding. The detailed engineering plan needs to be reviewed and confirmed after the opening on February 14 of this year. The total estimated cost is approximately four million yuan.</p>
<p>Engineering Design and Construction in Wuzhou City (Annual Report of the Wuzhou City Public Works Bureau for the 17th Year, March, Republic of China Year 19, Pages 91-141, Publisher: Wuzhou City Public Works Bureau, Guangxi)</p>
<p>Before the Guangdong-Guangxi conflict, the municipal administration of Wuzhou was extremely developed. At that time, the director of the Public Works Bureau was Mr. Ling Hongxun, and his achievements can be seen in this book, serving as a reference for municipal engineering in various places. Municipal engineering originally focused on roads and ditches. This book details the construction and explanations of the roadbed and pavement of the city's roads, as well as the roadbed and pavement of the side roads, and the construction and explanations of drainage ditches, side ditches, and large ditches. It includes dozens of attachments: a map of the city's streets, road cross-sectional views, drainage ditch plans, culvert plans, detailed drawings of large ditches, etc. The standards for road width in Wuzhou City are divided into several levels. The widest for vehicular roads is 50 feet, and for side roads, it is 20 feet. The types of pavement include asphalt, macadam, cement aggregate, water-bound macadam, and asphalt-surfaced macadam. The total length of roads constructed in the 17th year alone was more than 4,580 feet, with an area of more than 145,000 square feet. By the end of the 17th year, the total length of roads completed in the city was more than 20,000 feet, and those under construction totaled 2,190 feet. The total length of ditches in the city by the end of the 17th year was 5,190 feet for large ditches, 20,380 feet for drainage ditches, and 30,210 feet for side ditches. The construction cost of each item is recorded and compared, serving as a reference for road construction. The bureau built its own cement aggregate mixing plant, equipped with new electric mixers, manufacturing ditch pipes ranging from 6 inches to 36 inches in diameter, as well as sidewalk slabs. Detailed tables are attached for the various wooden molds, materials, and cement aggregate materials. In addition, there are detailed drawings of the fire lookout tower, river embankment road, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, cemetery for fallen soldiers, waterworks, Fuhe Bridge, etc.</p>

<p>9, Pages 9-22, Publisher: Compilation and Inspection Section, Hunan-Hubei Section Administration Bureau of the Yuehan Railway, Hankou, opposite Jiang Xujiapeng)</p>
<p>The Hunan-Hubei Railway is the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, from Wuchang to Zhuzhou, 418 kilometers long. The Jin-Ping Railway near Zhuzhou is also managed by this railway, from Zhuzhou to Anyuan, 90.56 kilometers long, so the total length is more than 500 kilometers. The entire railway was opened to traffic in the Republic of China Year 6, with a total cost of 59.3 million yuan. The losses over the years have been enormous, such as a loss of 3.556 million yuan in the Republic of China Year 16, a loss of 2.51 million yuan in Year 17, and accumulated losses of more than 19.39 million yuan by the end of Year 17. Year 18 was slightly better, with a surplus of more than 7,500 yuan. In Year 19, it suffered from the Zhang-Gui Rebellion and the disasters of the Communist bandits, and the situation was unspeakable. The greatest loss was the destruction of Bridge No. 219 and Bridge No. 220 at Potangkou, north of Rongjiawan. One was a five-span steel beam bridge with a span of 150 feet, and the other was a five-span steel beam bridge with a span of 100 feet. The bridge piers were also severely damaged. Although repairs were made in August and traffic was restored, reconstruction is still difficult. The entire railway has a total of 289 bridges, with 48 bridges over 60 feet. Among them, 91 small bridges are concrete arches, and the rest are steel beams, with a load capacity of Cooper E45. The tracks use 85-pound British style, the slope gradient of the line is one to one hundred feet, the ordinary curvature is 2 degrees, that is, a radius of 2,865 feet, and the maximum is 6 degrees, that is, a radius of 955 feet. There are a total of 32 locomotives and more than 590 passenger and freight cars. The author of this article is currently the director of the railway bureau, so the description is very detailed.</p>
<h3>The Crystallization of Love, a Four-Act Play: Yang Qijing</h3>
<p>By Xiong Fosi</p>
<p>It seems that many people say this: drama is the easiest to stir people's emotions in the palace of art. Then, the close relationship between drama and life, and drama and social transformation, can be naturally understood. Therefore, the selection of scripts is, of course, the first thing that drama activists should pay serious attention to.</p>
<p>In our China, regarding the creation of scripts, in recent years, due to the turmoil of the political situation and the changes of the times, the content of creation has also shifted in several directions. However, what can occupy the dominant force is still the social drama reflecting the times. This is naturally because of the close dependence of drama and life, and the critical relationship between drama and social evolution. To know the audience's interest is naturally inseparable from the emotions of the times. What can most stir them is, of course, the depiction and criticism of the current social facts they stand on. Some facts that the audience can intuitively understand can stir their hearts. And the value of drama is for the social needs of the times, hoping to inspire and strengthen people's will from it, recognize their responsibilities under the times, hoping to intensify people's emotions, and strive for social transformation and evolution, and even hoping to use it to ignite the torches in people's hearts, recognize the true meaning of life, and bravely stride forward onto the bright road.</p>
<p>The "Crystallization of Love" that this article wants to introduce is a four-act social drama depicting a noteworthy issue in the social era. The general plot of the entire play is as follows: The protagonist of the play is Ms. Lu Qiuxing. She is a lady from a traditional moral and scholarly family. She is a new woman in an old family. She has a lover, named Chen Dapeng. They are very close. The degree of their closeness is not only a spiritual and emotional harmony, but also a relationship has developed in terms of sex, and even her belly has gotten big. This is naturally not tolerated in a family with old traditional morals and scholarly background. As a result, they naturally have no choice but to take the best of the thirty-six strategies and run to another place to stay temporarily in a hotel. It is known that she gave birth after eight months of pregnancy, giving birth to a baby boy. However, in the environment of the old society, it naturally makes them lack the courage</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>to raise this baby. As a result, they had to bribe the waiter in the hotel to take him home to raise. Not only that, but the pressure of society on people is often extremely cruel. It not only does not allow this child to grow up beside his biological parents, but also considers this pair of young lovers to be unworthy of respect, and temporarily drifts to a foreign country to do business. Fortunately, the business they did overseas went smoothly, and after twenty years, they earned some money and returned to the country at this time. At this time, they wanted to find the crystallization of love that they had painfully abandoned twenty years ago. They certainly returned to the Grand Hotel where they used to live and give birth, and although the room was still the same room number 95, everything inside had changed. Where to find the crystallization of love that they had painfully abandoned twenty years ago? Later, after a lot of painstaking inquiries, they actually found some clues and found the waiter who had taken the child away. However, this is another prank of society. The trace was found, but the crystallization of love, because of the persecution of old traditional concepts in society, could not follow his biological parents, but was considered by society to be a despised illegitimate child, and was constantly insulted. However, the innocent child, how could he bear this kind of inexplicable insult? When he could no longer bear it, he resisted and actually caused a murder case and was arrested. When his biological parents came to visit, he happened to be locked up in prison. Fortunately, money can make the gods move, and his parents had plenty of money they earned in Nanyang, so they redeemed this crystallization of love. But strangely, the crystallization of love, knowing this fact, shouted loudly, saying since that is the case, then why do I need such parents? They are not my parents, they are definitely not my parents, and still refused to recognize the nickname of this illegitimate child, and walked away without caring about wealth and enjoyment. As a result, he ultimately did not return to his parents' side. This is the general plot of the entire drama.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the plot in each act. The first act is that the protagonist of the play, Ms. Lu Qiuxing, has just left her old family and is staying in the Grand Hotel. At this time, her abdomen is protruding, her face is pale, and she has occasional abdominal pain, showing signs of childbirth. Later, the hotel bellboy enters and reports that an old man surnamed Feng, about fifty years old, has come to see her. This makes her anxious. She knows that this must be her father. Her father has personally rushed up. Originally, Qiuxing's surname was Feng, but because she left the family, she changed her surname to Lu. This naturally made her unwilling to meet, and unable to meet. She had to grit her teeth and say, "You go tell him again that the one living in room 95 is Miss Lu, there is no Miss Feng, return this business card to him, say I don't know him." Later, her stomach ached so badly that she couldn't help but complain. When she was in unbearable pain, she actually complained about her lover, Chen Dapeng, saying something like this: "I just feel that I have been fooled by others, people have repeatedly tricked me into coming to this hotel, and now that things are urgent, he ignores me." In fact, her lover was just as anxious as she was, but she herself had too much suffering, so she had to say such complaints. And the end of the first act is that Qiuxing gave birth to a baby boy, a crystallization of love.</p>
<p>This is naturally going to be spread as a joke by the general public. No matter how sacred their union is, this crystallization of love is ultimately going to be regarded as an illegitimate child by society. Therefore, this fact is also considered to be novel material by the newspapers, and how could they not rush to publish it? But this makes Qiuxing even more embarrassed. Therefore, in the plot of the second act, Qiuxing had to resolutely leave the country and go to Nanyang to temporarily avoid it, and had to abandon this crystallization of love, giving it to the hotel waiter to raise. How tragic and heartbroken is the expression in this act.</p>
<p>Dapeng: Qiuxing, this must not be done, this must not be done.</p>
<p>This is too inhumane, let go, let go.</p>
<p>Dapeng pulls Qiuxing out of the curtain.</p>
<p>Dapeng: (Sobbing) Qiuxing, are you willing? Are you willing to kill the crystallization of our love? Are you willing, Qiuxing?</p>
<p>Qiuxing: (Sobbing) This is the best way in the absence of a better way. I feel even more pain in coming up with this method. You think, if you don't kill him, how will you arrange it?</p>
<p>Dapeng: Can't we take him away?</p>
<p>Qiuxing: This is definitely impossible. He has no right to follow us, and we have no right to take him away.</p>
<p>Dapeng: Isn't he our son?</p>
<p>Qiuxing: Yes, he is our son, a son we dare not admit. If someone comes to this hotel and asks you, whose son is this, do you have the courage to answer that this is our son?</p>
<p>Reading these few questions and answers, how will it stir people's hearts? It is the crystallization of their own love, but they do not have the courage to admit that this is their son, but instead say that he has no right to follow them. What a difficult situation. Later, they exhausted their thoughts and found another way out for this infant, so they had to give it to the hotel waiter to raise, and they left the country and went to Nanyang to do business for twenty years.</p>
<p>The plot of the third act is already twenty years away from the plot of the second act. The time and location are still in the Grand Hotel, and the characters and all the arrangements are as before, but the mood has changed, the tone has become depressed, and everywhere shows the scene that today is not what it used to be, and today is not as good as it used to be. Mrs. Chen is Ms. Qiuxing twenty years ago, and Mr. Chen is Mr. Chen Dapeng, Qiuxing's lover back then. They are both old. At this time, they started to make money from Nanyang and returned. They have everything in terms of money, power, and comfort. However, they only lacked the crystallization of love, the crystallization of love that had been abandoned, and had not yet been found. This can make them sad and regretful. For this reason, after returning to China, they still found this hotel to stay in and tried their best to find the crystallization of love that they had painfully abandoned back then. But after spending a lot of time, they still haven't found any clues. This is enough to make them anxious. Later, fortunately, they found the waiter from the hotel who had taken the crystallization of love, but they heard that the crystallization of love was locked up in prison because last year there was someone named Wang Kaitai who scolded him, scolding him as an illegitimate child, and the two fought. As a result, Wang Kaitai bumped into a stone and died, and this crystallization of love was arrested and put in prison for the sake of the name of the illegitimate child. This naturally made Qiuxing even more anxious. Fortunately, they had plenty of money at this time, and money can make the gods move, so they relied on the power of money to try their best to get this crystallization of love back. This is the plot in the third act.</p>
<p>When the fourth act opens, Qiuxing and her husband are very happy, especially Qiuxing, almost mad with joy, thinking that in a little while, their crystallization of love, which had been abandoned for twenty years, could return to her side. They hurriedly bought clothes, preparing to change them when this crystallization of love came back. Who knows that the result was unexpected and things went against their wishes. Strangely, after this crystallization of love knew all the facts, not only was he unwilling to return to his biological parents' side, but he even said loudly outside, "Since that is the case, then why do I need such parents? They are not my parents, they are definitely not my parents," and as a result, the biological parents and this person who was regarded as an illegitimate child by society became permanently separated.</p>
<p>The focus of the entire play is of course on the issue of this illegitimate child. What kind of status should an illegitimate child have in society? Should the illegitimate child himself be despised by society? These are all worth discussing. And in social reality, the issue of illegitimate children occupies a considerable seriousness. Often, due to the relationship of illegitimate children, social order is increased. This is not only that social drama activists should point out this fact to call people's attention, but especially social experts and those who are in charge of social order maintenance should stand up and pay attention and try to remedy it.</p>
<p>This script is not only deeply rooted in the material, but also in the structure, it can move people everywhere. The revelation of the tone is especially meticulous and sophisticated, which is of course the author's superior skill and success.</p>

<h3>The Stolen Masterpiece Incident (Continued): Haiyan</h3>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The theft of Leonardo da Vinci's (1452-1519) famous "Mona Lisa" was of international concern. The perpetrator, an Italian youth, endured countless hardships for this painting, finally stealing it from the Louvre Museum in Paris on a certain day in the summer of 1911. After two years, in the winter of 1913, it was discovered by a Florentine art dealer, who appealed to the French government. The "Mona Lisa" theft case, which caused a worldwide sensation, was finally settled.</p>
<p>The young man who stole the painting was by no means a born thief, nor was he, as mentioned above, a perverted sex fiend. He was the descendant of a noble Italian family. He did not steal the painting on a whim upon seeing it. The motive for his theft had been stirring in his patriotic heart for a long time. However, how could he steal the precious painting from a place as heavily guarded as the Louvre Museum? He almost forgot to eat and sleep because of this problem.</p>
<p>Finally, he left his homeland, Italy, full of depression.</p>
<p>He arrived in Paris and immediately went to see his country's master's painting, "Mona Lisa." He wanted to take action several times, but he could not find a safe method. Therefore, he was disappointed.</p>
<p>One day, he saw that the decoration on the wall of the "Mona Lisa" exhibition room in the museum seemed to be changed. He knew that on the day the decoration was changed, this room would be temporarily closed to visitors. He also knew that the famous paintings in this room would be taken down one by one and rehung in their original positions one by one after the decoration was completed.</p>
<p>Since outsiders could absolutely not enter, the method of stealing the painting was also hopeless. Thinking of this, he could not help but feel disappointed. Finally, a brilliant plan suddenly surged into his mind: "Why not become an interior decoration worker? Indeed, there is no other way to freely enter and exit the Louvre Museum except for this..."</p>
<p>This young foreigner painstakingly ran to the specific decoration store of the Louvre Museum to apply for a job. As a result, his purpose was achieved. He was hired as a decorator for the Louvre Museum.</p>
<p>On that day, the day he was waiting for, the happiness he felt was beyond description. He worked, worked hard.</p>
<p>Lunch time arrived. His partners urged him to go to lunch. He ignored them. His partners were annoyed and scolded him, but he still ignored them. When he saw the guard leaving him, he vigilantly stopped working, took out a sharp knife from his waist, cut the famous painting "Mona Lisa," which he had known since he was a child, from the frame, rolled it up, and ran outside in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the theft of Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," valued at more than two or three million yuan, no, beyond money, was as serious to the French government as the problem of the disappearance of the president. Immediately, a nationwide police network was set up, and the police searched everywhere for the criminals, paying special attention to the border defense of the country and setting up a very tight alert.</p>
<p>However, this naive and pure young man, the young man who took the risk out of patriotic motives, was finally spared by God's mercy and leaked out of the dangerous alert that was impenetrable, carrying the priceless famous painting of his motherland and fled back to his hometown of Florence.</p>
<p>His purpose was achieved, and his long-cherished wish was fulfilled.</p>
<p>But he did not celebrate his victory in any way. Obviously, this matter was also too serious. Seeing the frustration, annoyance, and sighing of the people who searched without success, he could not help but feel remorse. He decided that if he had the opportunity, he would have to brace himself and come out to confess.</p>
<p>"Although the 'Mona Lisa' cannot be displayed in our own national art museum, Italian expatriates living in France also have the right to enjoy the famous paintings of their country..." "The 'Mona Lisa' must be somewhere in Italy..." "We hope to devote all our efforts to find this famous painting." These were the words of the art dealers in Florence who were entrusted by the French government. Later, the young man's whereabouts were discovered by a famous art dealer in Florence. As a result of the consultation, he asked the young man to return the "Mona Lisa" to France, while he guaranteed the young man's safety as a condition.</p>
<p>Since then, the world's art lovers' deeply coveted famous painting "Mona Lisa" has been hung high in the Louvre Museum again.</p>

<h3>A Message About Raiding a Camp Ko</h3>
<p>I was drifting in a hazy realm when suddenly my nerves jolted. There seemed to be an echo of "Ko" lingering in my ears. "It must be Zhou calling me," I immediately regained my memory, opened my eyes, and looked toward the opposite bed. In the faint light coming in from outside the door, I saw her pulling the cotton quilt tightly over her head, without a sound. "Damn, I must be dreaming, or maybe I misheard," I drowsily tried to fall back asleep. At this moment, a sudden burst of noisy clamor rose from downstairs, like on the training ground. "Have our people been caught? No, no, no!" Although I couldn't hear it very clearly, the strong back-and-forth questioning, mixed in with the chaotic noise, was discernible.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but feel a little scared. A terrifying impression immediately loomed before me. Although it was just like a small wave that quickly subsided, and those wrongly accused were immediately released, everyone was genuinely worried about the danger those accused faced at the time. Now, similarly, it was at night, and everything was the same. Don't let them repeat that charade again, I was trembling with fear. At the same time, I heard Zhou tossing and turning in bed.</p>
<p>"Zhou, do you hear that?"</p>
<p>"I woke up a long time ago. I called you several times, but you didn't answer. Are you awake now too?" She was just as scared as I was.</p>
<p>The clamor went on for a long time before the voices gradually quieted down. Then I heard the sound of the downstairs door closing, and quietly, I heard nothing more. Only then, carrying this apprehensive impression, did we return to our comfortable dreams.</p>
<p>The next day, I got up as soon as it was light out. To resolve my questions from the night before, I ran down to the third floor and saw a large group gathered, discussing the events of the night.</p>
<p>"Miss Gu, why was it so noisy last night?" I asked a classmate I knew.</p>
<p>"I heard they were checking the male students' dorms. We heard them shouting 'Catch, catch, catch!' No one dared to get up." I walked into the crowd and listened again, and they were saying the same thing.</p>
<p>While washing my face, a few ayis were chatting and laughing. "The male teachers at our school dressed up as rickshaw pullers and snack vendors yesterday and went to steal things from the barracks of the male and female soldiers stationed at the bridgehead. They found out and chased them all the way back to the school to arrest them."</p>
<p>"Ah, no wonder I saw a male teacher I recognized yesterday with grime smeared on his face, wearing an oily apron, holding a bamboo basket filled with pears, bananas, and persimmons, walking barefoot with muddy feet, asking me if he looked like a snack vendor. After he asked, I realized who he was. Otherwise, I swear I wouldn't have known he was a student at our school."</p>
<p>This conversation truly left me in a fog. Dong, dong, dong, the school bell forced me to stop listening.</p>
<p>I passed by the training ground and saw from afar a Boy Scout bivouac tent and a flag erected on the grass, fluttering in the wind, surrounded by many, many people. Because of time constraints, I hurried past.</p>
<p>After class, I went to the student bulletin board. A large, newly posted white paper notice was prominently displayed before my eyes.</p>
<p>Oh, "A Battle Report of Raiding a Camp." And so I read line by line. It turned out that on a patch of grass along the road to Wusong Town, the Boy Scouts from the Liangjiang Physical Education College, the China Physical Education College, and the Suzhou Zhongshan Physical Education College were camping there. The students of our school, to gain practical experience in military training, had sent advance notice to them, planning to raid the camp that night. Later, after obtaining permission from the enemy, two scouts were temporarily dispatched, disguised as peddlers and rickshaw pullers, to scout out the enemy camp. They set off at eight o'clock in the evening, advancing in three routes, crawling forward on the dark, uneven cobblestone road. Some pricked their hands and faces, some</p>

<p>tore their clothes, but they were not discouraged. They still bravely attacked. Although only a little over fifty people went, because of skillful command and the soldiers risking their lives, the result was a triumphant return. The tent and flag on the training ground were their captured spoils of war.</p>
<p>Playing, it's just playing around. But, I think this is meaningful. In the current state of our nation's languishing will, they can endure hardship and shout, fight, and awaken us from our illusions in the darkness. Although it's just playing, this courage is indeed worthy of our admiration.</p>
