<h3>記非洲之蛇市</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>蛇毒物也我人見之驚避惟恐不及今有毒蛇巨蟒羅列市場任人選購者我人聞之得不視爲奇事乎乃非洲境内向有賣蛇之市場當此春日又爲蛇市熱鬧之時個中情形言之亦别有風趣因述之如次</p>
<p>蛇市槪况　以非洲之賣蛇事業而言最盛之處當推開普敦而開普敦市内尤以阿德蘭街爲蛇市集中之處此種毒蛇巨蟒來自何處蓋亦耐人研究者也此中大抵由獵蛇之人供給而今歲之蛇市其中尤以獵蛇專家貝恩所得者爲最多當其率領獵人往喀拉哈利沙漠獵蛇時備嘗艱苦而結果乃得大批巨蛇此種冒險精神實足令人欽佩蓋貝氏旣爲獵蛇老手其往非洲各地冒險覔蛇亦已有多次早將獵蛇工作視爲家常便飯矣且此次又得一家蛇公司依照聯邦法律帮同合作故獲蛇之多亦爲往年所不及也</p>
<p>毒蛇展覽　非洲之蛇商其中事業最大者當推蛇園ＳnakePark所謂蛇園者亦爲公司性質大都集股營業設蛇園者羅致各種毒蛇巨蟒陳列園中任人選擇其收入方面並非專在售蛇蓋當蛇市熱鬧時將各種奇蛇陳列園中舉行毒蛇展覽大會而參觀之人必接踵而來所收門票之價亦大有可觀今歲非洲之蛇尤爲繁多故蛇市更見發逹惟非洲之蛇市向大都操於動物園及蛇園之手目前營蛇園者又增加不少惟近年以來爬行動物以供過於求之故售價日低即最大之蛇如巨蟒之類每尺之售價亦僅值半克羅（貨幣名）各種蛇類蛇園方面均印有目錄價值高下不等購蛇之人其中大槪以醫生動物園主博物院主等爲多每年非洲人民對於蛇價之收入爲數亦頗可觀云</p>

<h3>霍桑探案轉灣（七）</h3>
<p>— 程小靑</p>
<p>（三）警署中</p>
<p>我們進了警署不料又有一個小小的頓挫那署長竟不在署中一時没人負責這誤會分明還不容易剖白我因厲聲向那探夥道（你快去把署長找來我没有功夫等候今夜的事你幹得很好你準備着得功罷）我這一種的語聲和態度竟使那個蠻不講理的探夥露出些兒訝異的神色因爲尋常犯罪的人踏進了警署總不免有些兒惶恐畏懼的表示我的聲浪態度却恰正成一個反比例那委實不能不使他驚疑起來他果眞向一個值夜的週番接洽了幾句便派了一個人出去找尋署長我也老實不客氣的走到週番室的電話箱前先打電話到霍桑寓裏問問他曾否回寓事又不巧據他舊僕施桂說他曾回寓過一次但轉了一轉又匆匆出去了我打電話的時候那探夥和那值夜的週番都在旁邊那週番似乎比較的靈敏些因着我和施桂的談話似已猜想到我是誰我見他向那探夥竊竊的私語了幾句那探夥的臉色似已逐漸的變易起來我仍絕不理會正要打第二次電話忽見外面走進一個人來那人穿一身深靑呢的中山裝上層有些短鬚還戴着一副托力克眼鏡這人就是第四分署的署長面貌却很熟識分明曾在那裏見過不過一時却記不起他的姓名那署長一走進來那個探夥便恭恭敬敬的走前一步要想報告的樣子署長却揮一揮手一直走到我的面前脫了呢帽伸出手來和我交握嘴裏又發出一種很親熱的歡呼道（包先生久違了難得你光降）我倒又窘促起來我再也想不起他的姓名不知怎樣稱呼但他却十二分機警又自已通報道（兄弟是張寳全三年前我在杭州的時候息游别墅那件案子不是靠着先生們的助力才得解决麽）他說着便拉着我走進他的辦公室去又很殷勤的請我坐下我才記得那時候他曾爲着那别墅中的神秘的兇案他曾親自趕到上海我和霍桑確曾帮過他的忙不過我因着交接的人多竟記不得他的姓名</p>

<p>按路礦雙方爭點有二（一）延期費照北寗路定章凡普通商家運貨由路局撥車如廿四小時内不將貨物裝齊即須收納罰欵惟開灤與北寗所訂運費合同關於此點無明白規定因開灤用車有六百輛之多如將空車送入叉道待用其停留最久之車必爲最先入叉道之車但礦中用車必先取其距離最近者倘拖用先入叉道之車諸多困難故延車一層向以全體六百輛之平均在叉道内停留時間爲標準北寗路現任當局否認此辦法向開灤要求追付歷年延車費一百廿餘萬元開灤方面不肯承認此其爭點一（二）煤價開灤之煤除北寗路採用外津浦北段向用開灤煤其價照合同規定與北寗路相等惟津浦煤欵先後積欠十餘萬之多久未淸付開灤曾以拒絕供給爲應付方法津浦要求開灤對於舊欠酌予核减則所有欠欵即可淸付開灤允辦後北寗路聞訊要求對於該路已付煤欵亦援例减價開灤以爲對於津浦係一種淸理舊欠之不得已辦法其他購主不能援例辦理雙方對此節尙無解决辦法此其爭點二惟鄙人之意以爲此事應由政府迅速調解或仲裁一面先恢復煤運否則東煤輸入日多價值又昻直接使工廠及居戶用煤者受損間接得牽動勞工生計且增多漏巵不少</p>
<h3>收回礦產</h3>
<p>至收回開灤煤礦已由煤業公會建議國民會議自是正當辦法按開灤總公司係於民國元年由開平灤州兩公司合組而成經中央兩政府批准條約規定十年之後可照極公平之價由灤礦公司向開平購買全部資產如我國根據條約收回英方無反對之可能贖價一層前據京津泰晤士報言須七千萬元現正金價昻貴至多亦不過一萬萬元此層應由國府與英政府交涉與開灤運煤絕對無關倘雙方長此相持開灤礦不過受一時滯銷之損失我國則國家受路運損失人民受煤貴煤荒損失徒令擁有撫順等礦者不惟增多銷路抑且增漲價值坐獲漁人之利也</p>

<h3>懷疑的解剖</h3>
<p>— 輝</p>
<p>「氷定於明天到杭州去他說要約他的愛人紅一同去前次曾約她一同到乙鎭去以事未果這一次總能實現了」絮在晚飯時對我說於是我們便又談着氷和紅的事情直到他們回來之後</p>
<p>在迷曚的晨霧裏太陽還懶着出來的時候氷和紅已起來了等到我們起身的辰光他們已趕着船去了到他們可愛的環境理想的事實中進行氷的理想紅的意想從今天始在我們的眼光中證明了</p>
<p>我的朋友喲最近你們不是對於我有好多懷疑嗎你們不是對於我不信任嗎我的朋友喲最近你們不是聽到許多關於我的不好的說話嗎你們不是聽到許多關於我的破話嗎從今天起於是我可以在你們面前辯護我自己了並且不容我辯護你們也當明瞭了我的朋友喲一切的一切你們大槪可以諒解我了吧</p>
<p>你們對於我懷疑不信任我也明知道是氷的指使關於我的不好的說話和破話我也明知道是氷所造出來的我更明知道事實總有對我剖白的一天所以我早先也不曾加以留意和反抗因爲遲早在我們的日子要證明一切的呀</p>
<p>我不怪氷也不怨恨氷因爲氷爲他自己起見要在你們衆人的面前證明他爲自己的忠實起見同時要爲他自己和紅多接近而不被别人說話起見他不得不這樣做不過他如果反轉來仔細的想一想他總該知道太對不我起了</p>
<p>最初氷愛着紅的時候我和紅還是朋友紅對於我確然是很好的不過因爲這樣氷便對我有些不自然於是他在我的面前總是發牢騷你們的面前便總說我不好並且說我和紅有關係一方面開脫他自己一方面使你們懷疑我而防範我於是我們便一起入了他的圈套直到絮把氷昨天的話宣佈出來和今天氷和紅一起到杭之後我們剛才明瞭一切的事實在以前是何等的錯誤在以前是何等的受人家愚弄呀我的朋友喲我的一切你們現在是絕對的明瞭了呀</p>
<p>氷確然是一個利害的靑年他在先前非但對你們如此並且在我的朋友嫣之前曾經破壞過我們的感情幸而路旁的野草依然引不起人家多大的戀呀事實是如此在三個月前未曾寫一封信給嫣信上是這樣的說</p>
<p>「……事實已很明瞭了但是我却不能久守在他們之旁希望你把他剷除了吧我爲了防止你幼芽的長大計因此在先前拼命的守着但我不能永久的守候着呀……」</p>
<p>我的朋友喲他和紅的接近原來是防止我嗎我的朋友喲你們曾得着同樣的信嗎不過我知道從今天起你們該明瞭一切了呀</p>

<h3>Indemnity and War Debts</h3>
<p>Since the global commercial slump and economic recession, many unresolved international issues following the war have been greatly affected. Among these, the German indemnity and the war debts owed by various countries to the United States are the most difficult to resolve. In this era of universal public and private hardship, the defeated nations are unable to meet indemnity payments, and the debtor nations are unable to repay war debts. This is due to environmental pressures and not intentional obstruction. However, the victorious nations and creditor nations, to safeguard their own interests, are naturally unwilling to easily concede. Both sides, acting in their own self-interest, are bound to engage in significant disputes. This can be foreseen. As reported by the Berlin dispatch, the German government is said to be planning to request a temporary suspension of payments under the Young Plan. Although this has not yet been formally proposed for discussion, according to German newspapers, national revenue has sharply declined, while expenses have continued to rise due to the extended impact of unemployment issues. Therefore, suspending indemnity payments is merely a matter of time. It can be asserted that this move has become an unavoidable reality. Furthermore, according to the Washington dispatch, the International Chamber of Commerce is discussing the war debt issue today. European representatives generally advocate for cancellation or reduction, believing that this is necessary to revitalize the world economy. However, the American representatives have already expressed their opposition. Although the war debt issue and the indemnity are two separate problems, the situation is similar in that one side wants to lessen the burden while the other does not want to relinquish its benefits. Therefore, it goes without saying that these two issues will inevitably become the focal point of contention.</p>

<h3>Recent News on Bandit Suppression in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Sun and Zhu's Armies Advance to Ningdu and Shicheng</p>
<p>There Seems to be a Possibility of Huang and Peng Surrendering</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: It seems that the recent bandit suppression news in this province is slightly easing. The large groups of Red bandits in Dongshao and Donggu rely on their dangerous positions to stubbornly resist. Plans are being made to disarm them all and annihilate them in one fell swoop. Military dispatches from the front: (1) Sun Lianzhong's troops, after pacifying bandit nests in Le'an and Zhaoxie Qingli, advanced to Dafang in Ningdu and again defeated five or six hundred Red bandits there, killing dozens of bandits. They continue to advance, and taking Ningdu is not a problem. (2) Zhu Shaoliang's troops suddenly crossed Guangchang and recovered the bandit nest of Baishuizhai, and then advanced to the border of Shicheng, where they will soon join forces with the Fujian army. (3) Wang Jinyu's troops have cleared out the scattered bandits in Yongfeng and Jishui. The Ji'an Clearance Committee has also concluded its work, and all post-war matters have been handed over to the counties of Jitai and Yong. (4) Li Mingrui's forces in western Jiangxi are still active in the areas of Suichuan, Yongxin, and Anfu, and are attempting to flee into Guidong and Cha in Hunan Province, where they are being jointly suppressed by Luo Lin and the Hunan army. (5) Kong Hechong's forces in northern Jiangxi are currently being fiercely suppressed by Tan's division, together with Liu Yi's independent 32nd Brigade. The bandit's base areas, such as Huangmao, have been captured by Tan's division. In addition, regarding the news of Peng and Huang's surrender, it is now heard that Huang Hanxiang has returned to Jiangxi from Hunan to report to He Jian, and has reached an agreement with Huang Gonglue's forces, but the guarantee issue for Peng Dehuai is still under negotiation. In the recent situation, there seems to be a possibility of Peng and Huang surrendering. (May 5th)</p>
<h3>Baodugang Bandits Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>Bandit Suppression Troops Return to Their Respective Defenses</p>
<p>Civilian Corps and County Government Handle Post-War Affairs</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The bandits of Baodugang and Mengshan in southern Shandong, led by Gu Yinshigui, Yin Shixi, Guo Mafeng, Ma Jingdai, Zhang Heilian, Sun Meisong, and others, numbered no less than ten thousand. Since the 18th of last month, the Third Route Commander-in-Chief, Han Fuqu, personally led the 22nd Division under Gu Liangmin, Tang Yaoxun's Brigade, the Pistol Brigade under Lei Taiping, the 58th Division under Chen Yaohan, the 7th Division under Wang Jun, and the 15th Route Army's Ma Tengjiao Brigade to jointly suppress them. They first resolved the Mengshan bandits and then attacked the old nests of Baodugang, large and small, in dozens of battles, killing and capturing thousands. It was not until the 5th of this month that the suppression was completed. On the evening of the 5th, Liu Shuxiang, the Chief of Staff of the Third Route stationed in Teng County, and Li Qizhen, the Staff Officer, led the entire staff of the staff office back to Ji'nan by special train. According to Li, the Baodugang bandits have been eliminated. The elimination process was as follows: first, the various armies surrounded and attacked. Initially, Chen's division was responsible for the southeast side of Feixian, Wang's division and Li's brigade were responsible for the southwest side of Lincheng and Zaozhuang, Gu's division and Tang's brigade were responsible for the west side of Sishui, and Ma's brigade was responsible for the west side of Teng County. The Civilian Corps and Lian Zhuanghui of Teng, Yi, and Fei counties were supervised by Wang Wanqing, the Commander-in-Chief of the Civilian Corps of southern Shandong, to intercept the bandits' retreat route. It is estimated that the Teng County Civilian Corps captured and killed over a hundred bandits each, and the Fei County Civilian Corps killed no less than seven or eight hundred bandits in the Liangqiu area. Chen's division was the first to occupy Baodugang. On the south side of Baodugang Mountain, there is a narrow and winding path that can lead up the mountain. Large stones on both sides have been chiseled into rings to allow people to grab onto them to climb up the mountain. Now the stone rings have been destroyed to prevent the bandits from occupying the top of the mountain again. The largest of the mountain caves can accommodate over two thousand people and have now been blocked and destroyed. Now that the bandits have been eliminated, the various armies have been ordered to return to their defenses. Gu's division commander led the division headquarters and the engineering and pistol battalions and all direct units back to Ji'nan, and vehicles have now been dispatched to welcome them. Ma Tengjiao's brigade returned to the original defense of Da Wenkou, Chen's division returned to the original defense of Linhe, and Wang's division remained stationed at the original defense of Lincheng. Only Gu's division's 65th Brigade under Tang Yaoxun remained, with the entire brigade stationed in the Shanting area between Baodugang and Teng County to deter the bandit area. The post-bandit suppression and rural pacification are being handled by Wang Wanqing's Civilian Corps of southern Shandong, together with the county chiefs of Teng, Yi, Fei, and Linhe, who are supervising the Lian Zhuanghui of each county. Wang convened a rural pacification meeting in Teng County yesterday, and it was resolved to search for weapons in the bandit area. Wang's Civilian Corps is currently stationed in the Sishui area north of Baodugang, with the headquarters located in Taipingyi. (May 6th)</p>
<h3>Henan Western Bandits Completely Dispersed</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: Zhang Fang, the Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Route Army, was ordered to suppress the bandits in western Henan. For two months, he personally led the various divisions and brigades in Qingjiao in Xu, Ru, and then in Song and Luo. All the notorious bandits entrenched in Fangcheng and Wuyang, such as Zhang Liansan, Pingdeng, Guo Shifa in Yiyang, Zhang Ximing in Lushan, and Cui Erdan in Song County, were severely attacked and completely dispersed. It was found that these bandits numbered over 20,000 and were a major disaster in western Henan for several years. Once they were eliminated, the people were happy and lived in peace. Zhang then returned to Bian to preside over the National Assembly elections, and the remaining unfinished rural pacification tasks were ordered to be handled by Pan Yi, the Chief of Staff of the army, in cooperation with Song Tiancai, the Division Commander. Pan is now leading the staff, adjutants, quartermasters, and medical officers to Wei, Yu, Xiang, and Wu counties to inspect the training performance of the various divisions and brigades of the army, and to investigate the discipline of the troops, with a view to reorganization. It is heard that Commander-in-Chief Zhang will go to Beijing at the beginning of this month to report on defense and civil affairs to the central government and the Commander-in-Chief. It is also heard that Chief of Staff Pan Yi and others will also accompany him.</p>
<h3>Changsha Customs</h3>
<p>Investigation into Embankment Donation Malpractice</p>
<p>He Jian Requests the Ministry to Send Personnel for Joint Investigation</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: After the discovery of the Changsha Customs embankment project donation malpractice case, the collection director of the customs, Yang Ren, and the acting section chief, Chen Ciyu, and the accountant, Wang Dajin, immediately fled. Most of the other important officials also left their posts. The Hunan Provincial Government, believing that the case had expanded and the main criminals were at large and could not be handled in a short time, transferred the case to the Construction Department for investigation. Song Hegeng, the Director of the Construction Department, specially invited Zhang Zexiong, a member of the Hubei Commission, Zhu Yaonan, the Chief of the Tax Bureau, and Yi Bin, the Supervisor, to discuss the matter yesterday. It is heard that the following has been decided: (1) To collect evidence, in addition to using the wharf donation income as the standard, the customs tariff joint receipts will also be reviewed. (2) Within two or three days, after the various certificates of the Changsha Customs have been investigated, the various commissioners must go to Yuezhou Customs to investigate the evidence. (3) The investigation of this case should be conducted with a spirit of impartiality, collecting all relevant evidence to ensure that the real culprits are brought to justice and not condoned, and that the final judgment is made by law. Furthermore, He Jian, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, again requested the Ministry of Finance to quickly send personnel to Hunan to conduct a thorough investigation and strictly ordered Mao Zhongcai, the Supervisor of the Customs, to return to Hunan to sort things out and hand over the escaped officials for punishment according to law. At the same time, he telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government, asking them to jointly urge the Ministry of Finance by telegram. His telegram to the Ministry of Finance reads: To the Honorable Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, the Chang-Yue Customs Supervision Office's embankment donation collection director, Yang Ren, committed malpractice and bribery. This government ordered the supervisor to place him under surveillance first, and a telegraph was sent to that effect. Furthermore, it was instructed that important officials of the office must not leave their posts without authorization before the case is resolved. It is on record that Yang was appointed by the supervisor, and the office was entrusted by the Hubei government to collect embankment donations for nearly three years, embezzling tens of thousands of yuan in donations. Yesterday, the Hubei Province sent personnel to Hunan to conduct a thorough investigation. After the team was ordered to bring Yang Ren to the case for interrogation, the team reported that the director, the acting section chief of the office, Chen Lvhui (Zi Ciyu), and the accountant, Wang Dajin, had all fled in collusion on the 11th and 12th days of this month, and that most of the important officials had also left their posts and no one was responsible. After further investigation, the daily revenue of the customs, including surcharges, is no less than tens of thousands of yuan. The supervisor's responsibilities are significant. In the past, he made a mistake in employing people, which led to malpractice. Recently, he entrusted the duties to no one, abandoning his post and affecting tax administration, causing criticism from outsiders and damaging the political system. In addition to first sending personnel to Hunan with the Hubei Provincial Commission to thoroughly investigate the surcharge, your ministry should be requested to quickly send personnel to Hunan to conduct a thorough investigation. At the same time, strictly order the supervisor to return to Hunan to sort things out and hand over the escaped officials within a deadline to be brought to justice for investigation and punishment in accordance with the law, in order to maintain discipline and order. I hope for a reply by telegram. He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, pays his respects. The telegram to the Hubei Provincial Government reads: To the Honorable Chairman He of Hubei and the Embankment Works Committee, the Chang-Yue Customs Supervision Office's embankment donation collection director, Yang Ren, committed malpractice and bribery (the text is the same as the previous telegram, omitted). No one is responsible. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Finance to quickly send personnel to Hunan to conduct a thorough investigation, and strictly ordering the supervisor to return to Hunan to sort things out and hand over the escaped officials within a deadline for investigation and punishment in accordance with the law, this surcharge is related to the treasury revenue of both provinces. Your government should investigate the relevant circumstances of this case and quickly telegraph the Ministry of Finance to strictly investigate and deal with it, in order to punish corruption and comfort the hopes of the people of the two lakes. Commissioner Zhang Zexiong is extremely capable and will temporarily remain in our province to conduct a thorough investigation to facilitate the progress. I still hope for a reply by telegram. Your brother, He Jian, pays his respects.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Western</h3>
<p>Disaster Areas are Repeatedly Requesting Relief</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The Liaoning Civil Affairs Department previously stated that this year is the season for spring plowing, and the farmers in the counties in western Liaoning affected by floods either lost their means of production or lacked seeds and were unable to engage in spring plowing. A relief plan was drafted, and it was decided to allocate 260,000 yuan from the province's donation and relief funds, which would be distributed evenly according to the severity of the disaster in each county for loans. This was approved by the Provincial Government for implementation. However, the number of counties receiving relief is limited to 13, and the maximum amount of relief per county is only 30,000 yuan, while some counties receive only 10,000 or 5,000 yuan. It has been found that there are many counties in this province that have been affected by disasters, and the need for funds for spring plowing relief is even greater, far beyond what can be covered by a mere 260,000 yuan. It is now heard that over 20 counties have requested relief from the province for spring plowing. Provincial Chairman Zang Shiyi, realizing that spring plowing in the various counties is urgent, and that recently in Liaoyuan, Shuangshan, and other places, thousands of starving people have gathered and extorted local wealthy households, surrounding the county seat, considers the situation to be serious and that relief cannot be delayed. He has ordered the Civil Affairs Department to investigate in detail and send personnel to the various counties to investigate and plan the distribution of funds. The amount of relief requested by each county is recorded below: (1) Faku County: 400,000 yuan for ordinary households, 620,000 yuan for disaster areas. (2) Shuangshan County: 400,000 yuan. (3) Fushun County: no specific amount. (4) Liaoyuan County: 1,000,000 yuan. (5) Kangping County: 300,000 yuan. (6) Xiuyan County: 200,000 yuan. (7) Shenyang County: no specific amount. In addition, the representatives of more than ten counties, including Gaiping, Jinchuan, Lishu, Heishan, Yi County, Huaide, Taonan, Dongfeng, Zhuanghe, Linjiang, Fuxian, Huinan, Xinbin, and Liaozhong, including Gao Xuecheng and others, have requested loans of hundreds of thousands of yuan per county, with no fixed amount.

<h3>Haiyuan Pavilion</h3>
<p>Losses of Books and Their Aftermath (Continued)</p>
<p>Wang Xiantang's Research Findings</p>
<p>The so-called "Ninth Master" lived in Liaocheng for over a month, never revealing his name, but it was known that he was from Tianjin, tall and thin, with a black mustache. When Wang Guanjun's troops moved to Hebei, it was discovered that his origin was Baoding, and he transported the looted items to his home for safekeeping. Soon after, Mr. Wang died of illness. His concubine then sold some of the preserved books. The Kuiwentang bookstore in the local area acquired the most, including, as reported, the "Collection of Cai Yong" (Huang Yaopu hired Jian Yun to proofread it; see "Yingshu Yu Lu")... A collection of essays from the Yuan dynasty was also acquired (see "Haiyuan Pavilion Book Collection Catalogue" engraved by Jiang). Both were already damaged. Later, booksellers from Beiping, hearing the news, flocked to Baoding. The Wenyoutang bookstore also purchased several copies, the titles unknown. It was only heard that there was a copy of "Xinzi Xinlun" (an old manuscript from the Daoist canon, proofread by Huang Yaopu based on a fragmented Song edition; see "Yingshu Yu Lu Xu Bian"), sold to Mr. Fu Yuanshu for one thousand yuan. Among the Haiyuan Pavilion's book collection, in recent years, Chinese people have paid much attention to its Ming blue-printed movable-type edition of "Mozi." Mr. Penglai Luantiao Fu has devoted over ten years of effort to studying ink and annotating "Mozi," but without seeing this edition, he cannot finish his work. Furthermore, Mr. Gu Tisheng wrote a letter saying that Mr. Yang's entire book collection has been acquired by the library and wanted to come from Shanghai to Jinan specifically to proofread the book. It is feared that within the country, there are more than just Messrs. Luan and Gu who eagerly await the publication of this edition. The original book was borrowed by Pan Boyin in the Guangxu Guiwei year to proofread and was never returned. After Mr. Pan's death, it was impossible to recover it. Details are recorded in "Yingshu Yu Lu Xu Bian" attached to Yang Fenghai's notes. I also searched extensively for this book in Haiyuan Pavilion but later knew that it was not in Haiyuan Pavilion at all. Three copies of this movable-type edition of "Mozi" were borrowed by Mr. Pan and have been lost. It is feared that there is no second copy in the entire country. Japan has reprinted copies and original printed copies, as seen in "Jingji Fanggu Zhi," which may be available there. Besides this, what I am most concerned about is Ye Linzong's handwritten manuscript of "Classic Interpretations" in thirty volumes, fourteen books, copied from the Wenyuan Pavilion edition. It had been altered by Tang and Song people and had lost the true appearance of Mr. Lu's original. Today, what we can still glimpse a bit of is only the remaining volumes of "Shangshu" unearthed from the Dunhuang Stone Cave. However, although Mr. Lu's book has been altered, the old altered version copied according to the Wenyuan Pavilion edition is still better than the new altered version by Lu Baojing of the Tongzhi Hall. Therefore, the most ancient complete version of "Classic Interpretations" currently existing in China should be the unique collection of Haiyuan Pavilion. Previously, I received a manuscript from Mr. Huang Jigang showing Gu Qianli's hand-written notes on "Classic Interpretations," saying: "Recorded from Liu Lufen's book, not found in 'Si Shi Zhai Ji'." I once said that recently, this book has faced three disasters: Lu Baojing's revised and reprinted edition contains many errors, which is the first disaster. Duan Maotang ordered Ye's copy to be proofread, entrusting it to incompetent people, resulting in many errors and omissions, which is the second disaster. Ruan Yuntai produced a book, proofreading based on someone who is illiterate, relying on Duan's edition, with countless mistakes, which is the third disaster. If these three types of books circulate in the world, then the true appearance of Mr. Lu's work will be obscured and lost. The only solution is to re-engrave the original manuscript of Ye's copy with precision, so that the clouds and fog may be swept away and the disaster may be averted. I lack the ability to do so, so I record this here to wait for those who cherish the ancients. Jian Geng Jushi wrote, according to Gu's postscript, that the value of this book was missed when he did not negotiate with Mr. Yang for a copy, which is regrettable. Now, it is unknown whether it has been destroyed by bandits or is still in the world. I just want to record this whole story so that booksellers and collectors everywhere can pay extra attention when they encounter this book and not repeat my mistake.</p>
<p>In the most recent half-year, Haiyuan Pavilion books that I had not seen during my inspection have been discovered from time to time in Jinan. It is not known whether they were scattered before my inspection or whether there is another reason. A total of nine types have been seen so far: One is Huang Yaopu's proofread "Mu Tianzi Zhuan" and Gu Qianli's proofread "Shuowen Xizhuan," as detailed in my "Elucidation of the Three Schools' Proofreading of Shuowen Xizhuan." This book was discovered when the Jin army occupied Jinan. At that time, the library was handing over duties and was burdened with debt, making it difficult to increase the library's debt to purchase this book. However, it was borrowed from a book friend and the proofreading notes were recorded in "Elucidation of Proofreading Notes." After I completed the handover and wanted to leave for elsewhere, I regretted losing this book and borrowed money from relatives and friends to purchase it. One is Huang Yaopu, Zhu Qiuyai, and others' joint proofread "Fengshi Wenjian Ji," and Wu Meian's handwritten copy of Huang Yaopu's hand-proofread "Jianghuai Yiren Zhuan," the Ming edition of "Wuyi Xiji," and the Ming edition of "Xu Baiyun Ji." Liu Wuzhong brothers' calligraphy album was discovered after my second takeover of the library, all of which had been purchased and collected by the library before. Huang Yaopu's proofread "Lin Hejing Ji," "Shaoxing Eighteenth Year Tongnian Xiaolu," and "Lu Hengzhou Ji" are all detailed in "Yingshu Yu Lu." The price was not agreed upon, and a Beiping bookseller purchased them along with several other types. It was said that there was a Song imprint, which was purchased at a high price. Since the books of the Yang family were scattered, the booksellers from Beiping have been traveling between Jinan and Liaocheng in an endless stream. In addition, there are several pieces of calligraphy and painting, and more than ten stones of Mr. Yang's collection of book seals. The library collected about nine stones. That is all that has been seen. Several months ago, there was a rumor that Mr. Yang was selling books in Tianjin, which I did not believe, because the Yang family was rich in land and would never sell books for a living. Then the rumor became more certain, and it was said that the reason for selling the books was that the current owner of Haiyuan Pavilion had suffered losses in trade in Tianjin, forcing him to do so. I still did not believe it. Finally, it was rumored that the books had been sold. There were twelve types of Song imprints. Initially, Ye Yuhu, Zhang Daishan, Liang Zhongyi, and others jointly offered 60,000 yuan, but Mr. Yang refused to sell. Then he sold them to the Japanese for 80,000 yuan indirectly. The person in charge was Wang from Liulichang in Beiping. I was in a confused state of belief and doubt. Recently, I obtained the total list of books sold from Beiping, which is transcribed as follows: Northern Song edition of "Wang Mojie Ji," six volumes (2,000 yuan); Song edition of "Chu Ci," twelve volumes (7,500 yuan); Northern Song edition of "Xunzi," ten volumes (4,200 yuan); Northern Song edition of "Tao Shi," two volumes (3,500 yuan); Song edition of "Three Xie Poems," one volume (2,000 yuan); Song edition of "Kui Tan Lu," six volumes (3,300 yuan); Northern Song edition of "Huainan Honglie Jie," twelve volumes (4,800 yuan); Song edition of "Zhuangzi," ten volumes (4,000 yuan); Song edition of "Fan Wenzheng Gong Wenji," eight volumes (2,300 yuan); Song edition of "Liu Xiansheng Wenji," twenty-four volumes (10,000 yuan); Song edition of "Guanzi," ten volumes (4,000 yuan); Song edition of "Wei Suzhou Ji," six volumes (2,300 yuan); Northern Song edition of "Xin Xu," five volumes (6,000 yuan); Song edition of "Ji Rang Ji," six volumes (3,000 yuan); Northern Song edition of "Shuo Yuan," ten volumes (5,500 yuan); Song edition of "Huang Du Cen Chang Four Poets Collection," four volumes (1,800 yuan); "Lu Donglai Ji," the number of volumes was not specified in the original list, the Jiang engraved book catalogue lists twenty-four volumes (2,000 yuan); Song edition of "Cai Duanming Ji," sixteen volumes (6,500 yuan); Song edition of "Shan Gu Daobi," ten volumes (2,500 yuan); Song edition of "Jin Shu Xiangjie," ten volumes (2,000 yuan); Song edition of "Sun Kezhi Ji," two volumes (2,800 yuan); Song edition of "Kuaiji San Fu," one volume (1,300 yuan); Song edition of "Yun Zhuang Si Liu Yuhua," two volumes (2,000 yuan). The above totals twenty-three types, amounting to 85,300 yuan, which does not match the rumored types. Twenty-one of them are seen in "Yingshu Yu Lu," and the other two are seen in "Haiyuan Pavilion Book Catalogue" engraved by Jiang Jianxia. The original list noted that they were all Song editions and that they were described in great detail in "Yingshu Yu Lu," but there are also some that are not listed in "Yu Lu." Also, "Lu Donglai Ji" is listed as a complete edition in the Jiang engraved book catalogue, which does not match the list. Also, the Yang family's collection of Song imprints of "Liu Hedong Ji" has two versions, one being the "Tianzhu Zhongjiao Yinbian Ben" and the other being the "Baijia Zhu Ben," both being twenty-four volumes. This is confirmed by the high price of 10,000 yuan, and it is feared that it is the former, the best of the Southern Song fine imprints, which is recently printed together with "Changli Ji," which is the most famous. It is heard that the Song edition of "Zhuangzi" has been separately acquired by Mr. Zhou Shutao and is not on this list. It is difficult to determine at this moment whether the above items are actually true or just rumors. I have known Mr. Yang Jingfu, the owner of Haiyuan Pavilion, for several years and believe that he would never sell our national treasures to foreigners. However, with the price list, book names, and original list all present, there may be some reason due to the change of events. If Mr. Yang can publicly demonstrate in a proper way that the rumors are not true, so that those who care about culture will not be uneasy because of this, then I would be very grateful. Since Mr. Yang has lost the books in his collection and fears that more unfortunate events may occur in the future, on December 14th and 15th of this year, he packed the remaining damaged books into more than fifty boxes and transported them by cart to his residence in the commercial port of Jinan for safekeeping. Mr. Yang has residences in both Tianjin and Jinan. Mr. Yang Jingfu usually lives in Tianjin, while his mother lives in Jinan. The packing and transportation of the books were handled by hired laborers from the family. Due to the hasty packing, there was no inspection, resulting in disarray. All are ordinary editions that the "Ninth Master" did not bother to look at. However, now there is not a single piece of paper or word left in Haiyuan Pavilion. (To be continued)</p>

<p>A patrol officer is accused of rape. Zhong Lunyu, a patrol officer at the Xuhang Public Security Substation, was accused of rape by a woman from Jiangyin, Cao Ping, to the county government. The details are quite bizarre. It is reported that the woman is 21 years old, a graduate of the Shanghai Women's College of Law and Politics, and formerly a teacher at a school in Zhenjiang. She claimed that she had a close relationship with Li Tai, the current supervisory officer of the County Public Security Bureau, when she taught in Zhenjiang. Last winter, at Li's request, she obtained her parents' consent to marry in the fourth month of the lunar calendar this year. Recently, she received a letter from Li stating that he was ill and went to Jia on the 17th of last month to visit Li. Unable to find Li, she went to Li's friend, Ji Zhonglun's place. Ji personally entertained her very well. Because it was late, she stayed overnight at Ji's house and was forcibly raped by Ji. However, according to people in the Xuhang Public Security Substation, Cao fabricated the story because Li had no intention of marrying her and saw that Li was seriously ill and unwilling to marry him. The county government is still investigating the matter because it is bizarre, and it is also questionable whether Li ever asked to be engaged and married to Cao. We will continue to investigate what exactly happened.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>The county government executed three bandits by shooting. Zhou Yintang and Jiang Awu, two bandits who imitated the Zhang family robbery case in Punan Xinjie Town, and Ni Ruirong, a kidnapper from Fengjing Township, were all sentenced to death after being tried and presented to the provincial government for approval. Therefore, at 11:00 a.m. on the 7th, the police were dispatched to escort Zhou Yintang and the other two to the Yuhuangge execution ground for execution by shooting after verifying their identities.</p>
<p>Deliberations on dredging the Da Zhangjing River. The Da Zhangjing River in the city is one of the main rivers. It has not been dredged for many years and has gradually become shallow and blocked. The county government believes that the river is related to commerce and ordered the Construction Bureau to plan. After replying, it opened a budget book and forwarded it to the first and second district offices for discussion and reply. Yesterday, the first and second districts, together with local people, held a meeting and agreed that it would be impossible to raise such a huge amount of money according to the plan of the Construction Bureau. It was found that the river was most silted up north of Yangqiao and should be thoroughly dredged. There are several sections south of Yangqiao that are silted up, but they do not need to be completely dredged, and selective dredging can be carried out, so that the cost is low and the work is easy. According to Sun Linji from Jiangbei, an estimated price list was opened and submitted for discussion. It is heard that the fundraising method is to be raised by the two districts, and the county government will be requested to allocate funds to supplement the river dredging expenses. In the future, a river works committee will be established to preside over the matter.</p>
<p>Qingpu</p>
<p>Endless robbery cases. The family of Pan Peiqing, a villager in Yujiajing Township outside the South Gate of this county, was robbed a few days ago, and Pan's sister-in-law and young daughter were burned with candles and the stolen goods were taken away. The robbers, speaking with a Hakka accent and wielding sharp knives, came again the night before last, numbering more than twenty people, and searched at will. Fortunately, Mr. Pan heard the sound, escaped, and sounded the gong to warn the police, and the robbers fled. The Guanyin Temple outside the West Gate was also robbed a few days ago, resulting in losses. Last night, when the temple held a Buddhist service, three robbers suddenly came, threatening to silence everyone, and robbed all the Buddhist women of their silver, clothes, and jewelry, totaling an estimated loss of more than 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Investigating the reason for the soaring rice price. The price of rice in Suzhou suddenly soared by more than one yuan in three days, causing panic among the people. The County Chamber of Commerce, according to inquiries from various industries about the reason for the soaring price, sent a letter to the Rice Industry Association to quickly explain the reason for the soaring price. According to people in the rice industry, the soaring price was due to weather conditions, which will inevitably reduce the harvest of the spring crop. However, it is said that some unscrupulous rice merchants have recently privately transported large quantities of rice out of the country. The county government is also investigating.</p>
<p>Kidnapped hostages in Dongshan are preparing funds for ransom. Wu A'da and Mei Qinjian, the young owner of a southern goods store in Dongshan Wu Xiang Township, and Zhu Yongmao Yongfu brothers and their children, totaling nine people, were kidnapped by bandits. At that time, Mei Qinjian and Zhu Yongmao's family worker, Zhu Shaonan, had returned. The bandits ordered the Wu A'da family to prepare 2,000 yuan and the Zhu Yongmao family to prepare 4,000 yuan for ransom. The ransom location was at Xixigang. The hostages' families are currently preparing funds to go to redeem them.</p>
<p>Mediating the wood machinery workers' strike. A small wave of strikes occurred among the wood machinery silk weaving workers in Suzhou. The county government has scheduled a mediation meeting for today (the 8th) in the morning, gathering responsible representatives from both labor and capital. Currently, the capital side has nominated Shi Junqing and Xu Xiaozhai as representatives, and the labor side has nominated Gu Rongqing and Yu Yueyun as representatives. The conditions put forward by the labor side are: (1) The capital side should pay the deducted wages. (2) Maintain the previous labor-capital agreement. (3) Set the wages for the three-shuttle satin weavers of new inventions. It is heard that the capital side intends to accommodate the above conditions. For the sake of maintaining local security, the Public Security Bureau has dispatched a flight team to patrol separately, not allowing coercion or strikes.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Opening the coffin for an autopsy in the West Gate murder case. The suspected death case outside the West Gate was examined twice by the county trial officer together with the coroner, but the result was only nail scratches. The family members were dissatisfied and requested that Dr. Su Mai'er from the Ti赐庄博习 Hospital in Suzhou come to Changshu to dissect and re-examine the body. On the morning of the day before yesterday, County Magistrate Tan, together with the trial officer, coroner, and doctor, went to the corpse field outside the West Gate to open the coffin for autopsy. After the examination, Dr. Su and others reported to County Magistrate Tan, the main points of which were: (1) No injuries to the internal organs. (2) No signs of meningitis in the brain dissection. (3) Pneumonia in the right lung lobe. After the report, the magistrate ordered the corpse family to sign and collect the corpse. The county government is now submitting the鉴定书and the details of the incident to the High Court for review.</p>
<p>A road robbery case occurred in Fushan Pond. Yin Kunzhi, who sells dried tofu in the Maojiaqiao industry outside Shuibeimen, returned home on the evening of the day before yesterday after selling goods for six to seven thousand yuan in Xiejiabridge. It was already dark when he passed Miaojiawan. In the dark shadows, he suddenly encountered a robber who first knocked Yin to the ground and punched and kicked him violently. Then he robbed all the copper coins Yin had obtained.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Bandits rob and burn the hostess. Zhu Tingbao, a resident of Zhuxiang in Yangjia圩, 16th District (Wan'an City) in the county, has been opening a restaurant in Shanghai for a long time and is quite prosperous. He built a new house in his hometown, which attracted the attention of bandits. The night before last (the 6th) at 10 p.m., more than ten local and foreign bandits broke into the house and beat Zhu's wife, forcing her to reveal the hiding place of the silver. They lit洋烛 in the便桶 and made her sit naked on it, causing burns to her lower body. They robbed about 2,000 yuan of silver, gold, jewelry, clothes, and other items. Yesterday, the victim came to the city to report and request a thorough investigation of the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous merchants secretly transport rice out of the country. Our county has always been a gathering place for rice, so rice merchants from various ports mostly come to Wuxi to purchase grain. After the government banned exports, the price of rice never exceeded ten yuan per stone, which benefited the general public. Unexpectedly, heaven has not been kind lately, with continuous heavy rain causing the price of rice to rise sharply. Gao Baimi has risen to nine yuan and nine jiao per stone, and the secret market has even opened to ten yuan and three jiao, which is more than one yuan higher than last month. The reason for the soaring price is that a small number of unscrupulous merchants are greedy for petty profits, disregarding the ban and harming the poor by transporting white rice by Jinpu train to Jinan and then to Qingdao for loading into the sea for export to Japan. There are already thousands of stones. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this in order to protect the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Privately settling a huge opium and red pill case. Su Lanbao, a resident of Wangdaoren Lane outside the North Gate, has been trafficking in opium and red pills. Yesterday, someone bought a box of red earth from Su. As soon as he left the door, he was caught by a detective and admitted that he had bought it from Su. Su was arrested, and the case was settled privately for 800 gold. Also, Zhu Fusheng trafficked 360,000 red pills from Shanghai, which were transported through Yicheng Bridge in the eastern countryside of the county. Wu and others found out about this and detained the ship and cargo. Zhu paid 2,000 yuan to settle the case privately.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>The detective team leader goes to Shanghai to arrest notorious bandits. Two notorious bandits, Liu Guisheng (Liu Hanting) and Chen Fengshan, have been hiding in No. 50, Second Lane, Songmao Workshop, Yangshupu, Shanghai, since the bandit leader Gao Xiaosheng was arrested. These bandits gathered and discussed on the 19th of the lunar March to collude with other gangs of bandits to disturb Changzhou and retaliate against Shangyu Village (Gao Xiaosheng was a villager of Shangyu and was captured). This news was detected by the detective team leader of Wuyi, Ni Gusheng, and deputy team leader Xu Shaoyun. On the morning of the 6th, they led detectives to Shanghai and arrested Liu and Chen at their address. They were escorted to the Yangshupu police station and transferred to the Special Zone Local Court for detention. Team leader Ni and others immediately returned to Changzhou to report to County Magistrate Zhang, who prepared a document and sent team leader Ni and others to Shanghai to escort them back to the case for handling.</p>
<p>Two robbery cases occurred in the Fifth District. Chen Caigen's family in Xiahegou, near Shandongqiao Village, Jiuyingbei Township, Fifth District, Wuyi County, was robbed on the night of the day before yesterday at 11:00 p.m. Caigen and his wife were held and beaten, and all the cash, clothing, and jewelry were searched and taken away. Also, on the night of the 5th, more than ten armed robbers broke into Shen Xinrong's house in Yangjiao Village in the district. Zhang Honghai, a villager, heard the news and went to chase and arrest them. At the same time, military police sentries also arrived and immediately joined forces to capture a robber. The military police escorted Zhang Honghai and the captured bandit to the city on the 6th. Zhang's family invited the local 保张四大 and others to the团部to post bail for Honghai, who was mistakenly taken away.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>After investigation by the督署, the kidnapping case was clarified. Zhang Bucao, a resident of Xujiaqiao in the county, went to the督办署to report that Xu Fuquan and Xu Wanfu had kidnapped a female ticket. The督署has now ordered the county to instruct the Public Security Bureau's detective team to send personnel to take the plaintiff to investigate and arrest the defendant Xu Wanquan and Wanfu's father, Xu Dechao, to Yangzhou on May 5 and send them to the署. Military judge Li Xiangfu interrogated Xu Dechao in court. Xu Dechao confessed that Fusheng had lured Zhang Bucao's daughter-in-law to the Daan Station in Zhenjiang last year and had adulterous relations with her. Zhang searched for her and brought her back. On January 22 this year, Wanfu lured Zhang's daughter-in-law to the Wufangzhai restaurant at Longmenkou in Anqing and hid with her, cohabiting with her. It was ordered that the case be related to harmony and seduction, and that they be detained pending investigation and handling.</p>
<p>The district chief of Nantong is accused and sent to the省督署for acceptance. Pan Lanfen and Ding Zinan, residents of Nantong County, reported that the district office director of the county public office, Li Bingqian, assistant Wang Bingzhi, and others had used bandits to defraud money and harm people. It has now been approved that the plaintiff will submit a report on May 5. Military judge Li Xiangfu interrogated the plaintiff. The evidence of the plaintiff's allegations was conclusive. Since Li and others were administrative personnel, the file was immediately transferred to the provincial government together with the witnesses for delivery to the court for handling.</p>
<p>Gaoyou</p>
<p>The hostages in Dongxiang escaped safely. Wu Guogui's youngest son, Chunling, a farmer in Dongxiang County, was kidnapped by bandits in February. For more than two months, there was no news. It was heard that the bandits had been captured by the 25th Route Command stationed in Qing and Chunling was rescued. Because no one claimed him at the time, he was temporarily handed over to the county's orphanage for foster care. Wu has now received the news and went to recognize him by boat last night.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>The death sentence for bandits still needs to be re-examined. The police team captured Fang Zanqing and Xue Xi'en, bandits from Dongxiang, who committed robbery and murder. The court interrogated them and sentenced them to death. The case was submitted to the provincial government for review and decision. It has been ordered to be returned for re-examination.</p>
<p>Collecting illegal evidence in the Yan case. Yan Diannan, the former police team leader of Nantong County, was accused by all the district chiefs of the county of colluding with bandits and harming the people. The provincial government ordered the Security Department to question Director Li. On the 6th, Director Li ordered County Magistrate Zhang to conduct a detailed investigation of Yan Diannan's illegal evidence in military affairs, collect it, and submit it for investigation.</p>
<p>The Finance Department transferred personnel to thoroughly calculate the corruption. Zhang Shishao, the former director of the Finance Bureau, was accused of colluding in corruption and embezzling public funds. The Control Yuan ordered the provincial government to investigate and reply. The Finance Department ordered the county government to transfer the grain and canal personnel to the department for joint calculation and provincial corruption in order to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram requesting exemption from silk tax. There are more than 100 silk factories in Jiaxing, so farmers have also increased their silkworm farming business year after year. This year, each silk factory has been hit by international trade, and the Shanghai silk factory has been shut down. The impact of unsold old cocoons opening the factory to collect cocoons is still less than 10% so far. If no measures are taken to provide relief, it is very important for business and people's livelihood. The County Chamber of Commerce has sent a telegram to the province to request exemption from various silk cocoon taxes and all local expenses in order to protect the cocoon industry and focus on people's livelihood.</p>
<p>The Finance Department sent personnel to review the business tax. The Jiaxing Third District Business Tax Bureau has completed the investigation of the business conditions of various businesses in Jiaxing, Pinghu, and Jiashan counties and reported it to the department for review. After the Finance Department received the report, it feared that the merchants had concealed the report, so it has assigned special personnel to come to He to review the tax affairs in order to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Shaoxing</p>
<p>Prisoners attempted to escape from prison unsuccessfully. Prisoners Xia Jishou, Jin Shixiong, Chen Jinrong, Li Guansheng, Feng Ashui, Yu Awu, Qiu Chaofa, Gu Amao, etc. of the Shaoxing Prison Department jointly打地道, planning to escape on the night of the 5th. Fortunately, they were discovered early and strictly guarded against, so they were not successful. The case has been transmitted by Wu Yuedeng, prosecutor of the court, for separate interrogation.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from the Tianjin Municipal Council Representatives</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: I have read the special telegram in the April 29th issue of your newspaper, stating that the Tianjin Municipal Government has decided to provide each national council representative with 2,100 yuan for travel expenses. However, the travel expenses for the national council representatives of this city are 60 yuan per person, according to the central government's regulations. The statement in the original telegram is not true. I am writing to request a correction to avoid confusion. Sincerely, Liu Butong, Lu Dangping, and Chen Wenbin, Representatives of the Tianjin Municipal National Council.</p>

<p>The Plight of Middle School Teachers</p>
<p>Only Half a Month's Salary Was Paid This Semester</p>
<p>Provincial Schools to Hold a Plenary Meeting of Representatives in Mid-May</p>
<p>More than three months have passed since the opening of Jiangsu Provincial Secondary Schools, and the summer vacation is approaching in the blink of an eye. However, the education funds were only received last week for half a month in February. Many teachers and staff are poor and have been living on pawned goods for more than a day. The Teachers and Staff Union has scheduled to hold a plenary meeting of representatives from various schools in Beijing on May 18 to resolve livelihood issues. The following is a letter from the Union to the Education Funds Management Office:</p>
<p>Letter to the Education Funds Management Office</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: More than three months have passed since the opening of the provincial schools, and the summer vacation is approaching in the blink of an eye. The education funds for February have not yet been issued. How can the teachers and staff continue to work for the public with empty stomachs for a long time? Your office is responsible for managing the lifeblood of the province's education funds. You must not say that you can only spend what you receive. You have reduced yourself to an accounting office or accountant of an organization. After a temporary meeting of our association, it was decided to request your office to issue the salaries for February and March before May 10 in order to relieve the distress. Otherwise, a plenary meeting of representatives from various schools will be convened to petition the National Assembly for resolution. This is a quick letter to inform you, hoping that you will understand and provide assistance. This is to Mr. Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funds Management Office.</p>
<p>Reply from the Education Funds Management Office</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: I have received your letter and understand the situation. I have checked that the funds for the first half of February for all middle schools and above and various social education institutions, as well as the funds for the first half of March for the various experimental primary schools, were all issued simultaneously on April 29. We are currently preparing to issue them one after another in order to maintain operations. However, the tax revenue is now in a slow period, and the财政厅 only allocated 35,000 yuan of the 300,000 yuan in subsidies listed in the 19th year budget, and the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly催无效 for the 600,000 yuan in treasury bonds. We are anxiously requesting the Jiangsu Education Funds Committee to find a way to provide relief. I am replying accordingly, hoping for your understanding.</p>

The subsidies from the Ministry of Finance and the财政厅have repeatedly催无 效. Although we are trying our best to raise funds, we have only issued the funds for the first half of February for the various middle schools and above, and the funds for the first half of March for the various experimental primary schools. The various schools and institutions urgently need funds, and there is a sense of imminent danger. In addition to replying to the Union, I am also writing to inform you, hoping that you will quickly convene a meeting to seek a method of salvation. This is my sincere hope. This is to the Jiangsu Education Funds Committee.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Review of Educational Opinions from Beiping City</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, by order of the Executive Yuan, reviewed the administrative plan of the Beiping Municipal Government for January to March of the 20th year of the Republic. The Ministry of Education replied, stating: “As per the instructions from the Executive Yuan, the Beiping Municipal Government has submitted its administrative plan for January to March of the 20th year. In addition to issuing separate orders, we hereby instruct you to examine and submit the original plan for review and approval. The department should comply, conduct a detailed review of the education administration matters under its jurisdiction, and submit the following: The compilation and review of Chinese language textbooks for primary and secondary schools as listed in the original plan is inconsistent with the regulations of the Ministry. Primary school education should only teach the national language (Mandarin), without so-called Chinese literature. All teaching materials related to the national language and Chinese literature for primary and secondary schools should, according to regulations, adopt the textbooks already reviewed and approved by the Ministry, without the need for separate compilation. Furthermore, no book review organizations should be established. If there is a need to compile supplementary teaching materials, the compiled materials must be submitted to the Ministry for approval before they can be used. The method for rewarding exemplary parents and students should be sent directly to the Ministry of Education for record after it is finalized. Moreover, the progress of primary and secondary education in Beiping City has been minimal in recent years. It is proposed that the municipal government be instructed to order the Municipal Education Bureau to stipulate concrete rectification measures in future administrative plans to facilitate improvement."</p>

<h3>Notice from the Municipal Education Bureau Regarding</h3>
<p>Interpretation of the Publication Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued Notice No. 16 regarding the interpretation of the Publication Law, stating: "As per the Shanghai Municipal Government's Instruction No. 8188, which states: 'As per the Ministry of Interior's Document No. 459, which states: "As per the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 1613, which states: 'To inform: As per the Legislative Yuan's Document No. 137, which states: "As per the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee Propaganda Department's Public Letter No. 4054, which states: '1. The registration of newspapers and news agencies has been handled by the Party, while the establishment matters have been handled by administrative organs. Since the promulgation of the Publication Law, various provinces have had many doubts regarding the handling of these matters. Before the promulgation of the Publication Law, local governments had their own provisional regulations for handling the establishment of newspapers and news agencies. According to Article 7 of the Publication Law, there is only a provision for registration. Does the registration mentioned in this article equate to establishment? Should the previous establishment procedures in various places be stopped entirely because of this registration? Regarding the registration of newspapers, what is the connection between the government and the Party? Should publications related to Party affairs and ideologies be registered with both the Party and the government? Furthermore, what is the scope of the terms "matters related to Party ideology or Party affairs" as mentioned in Articles 7 and 13? For example, if newspapers publish resolutions of the Central Standing Committee, can it be considered a record related to Party affairs? We hope for a clear explanation to facilitate handling.'" The Executive Yuan instructed that the matter be submitted to the Legal Committee for review. Subsequently, the Committee reported that it had been discussed at the 109th and 113th meetings, where it was agreed that the establishment and registration of newspapers and news agencies are both intended to understand their internal organization and purpose before they begin publishing, in order to facilitate review and verification. The purpose is the same. After the implementation of the Publication Law, there is no need to undergo the establishment procedure in addition to applying for registration according to the law. All provisional regulations originally established by local governments regarding such establishment matters should be invalid. News reports or magazines containing matters related to Party ideology or Party affairs should apply for registration with both the Party and the government. Articles 7 and 13 of the Publication Law are very clear. The resolutions of the Central Standing Committee are related to Party ideology or Party affairs, and their publication should be subject to the provisions of Article 7, Paragraph 3, and Article 13, Paragraph 2 of the Publication Law.' The Executive Yuan approved the review report at the 137th meeting on March 28th and instructed that the Ministry of Interior be notified. The Ministry of Interior was instructed to notify its subordinates. The Municipal Education Bureau was instructed to be notified. This notice is hereby issued to all newspapers, news agencies, bookstores, and magazine publishers in the city for their information. Special announcement. May 7th, 20th year of the Republic of China. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau.'"</p>

<h3>Famous Basketball Team from the Philippines,</h3>
<p>The Santo Tomas Team</p>
<p>Passing Through Shanghai on the 10th... Will Compete Against Our Country</p>
<p>The Santo Tomas University basketball team from the Philippines, renowned in the Far East, has had a remarkable record in the past year, winning all ten games played. Even the tenacious Zhenru team of our country (a combined team from Jinan and Chih Chih), lost by a significant margin when they met during their southern tour during the New Year. The team is scheduled to pass through Shanghai on May 10th aboard the Empress of Russia en route to Japan and plans to play a friendly match with a well-known Shanghai team that evening. It is understood that Mr. Li Baojun is actively organizing a team to compete. The team members are all alumni and students from St. John's and Shanghai University, including Chen Zhongen, Chen Xianglong, Ouyang Yongyuan, Li Baojun, and Liang Guoquan. When the two powerhouses meet, it will surely be a great performance for basketball enthusiasts to enjoy.</p>
<h3>Marathon to be Held</h3>
<p>Registration Deadline: Noon on the 18th</p>
<p>The local marathon race is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 24th of this month. As the date approaches, many people have enthusiastically registered with the secretary, Mr. Peasley. Several Chinese athletes have also registered. It is reported that Mayor Zhang Qun has agreed to the committee's request to become a sponsor to promote the event. It is also reported that several French athletes will participate on the Western side, and it is hoped that more than twelve British athletes will join. There are also quite a few Russians. The registration deadline is set for noon on the 19th. Runners who are interested in participating can quickly register with Mr. Peasley at Room 161, Shanghai Municipal Council Office on Jiangxi Road, and pay the competition fee of two yuan.

<h3>Qingdao Games Set</h3>
<p>Two New National Records</p>
<p>Women's High Jump—10,000 Meters</p>
<p>—But Shanghai's Zhang Baojin's High Jump Score is Even Better</p>
<p>The Qingdao Spring Joint Games were held on the 2nd and 3rd at the Huiquan Racecourse, chaired by Xu Chongqin of the Municipal Education Bureau. Women's high jump and men's 10,000</p>
<p>Qingdao Games Women's Individual First, Yuan Cheng森, a student of Wende Girls' School, won the 50-meter, 200-meter, high jump (breaking the national record), and long jump, four firsts, and the shot put second (photographed by Wei Li)</p>
<p>meters both broke the national records. Yuan Cheng森, the winner of the women's high jump, achieved a height of 1.24 meters, breaking the national record of 1.22 meters held by Feng Falan. However, Zhang Baojin's score of 1.26 meters at the Shanghai First Secondary School Joint Games is even better. Sun Anting, the winner of the 10,000 meters, achieved a time of 39 minutes and 45 seconds, breaking the national record of 53 minutes and 27.8 seconds held by Liu Gu Xue.</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the North China Preliminary Selection in Harbin</h3>
<p>Sun Guiyun Sets Two Records in 200-Meter Hurdles</p>
<p>Women's 50-Meter, All Four Break National Records</p>
<p>Men's Group Performance is Average, Athletes Lack Practice</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, April 30th: Two hundred and ten athletes from nine male and female schools in the Harbin Special District held the preliminary selection of representatives to attend the 15th North China Games at the First Public Stadium. The weather was overcast and rainy several times on that day. In the afternoon, the rain poured down, and the three competitions of the men's javelin, discus, and long jump had to be stopped midway and rescheduled for the finals on May 1st. In this selection, the number of representatives for each event was set at four. Any athlete who was selected in one event was allowed to register for four events. The Department of Education would review the results, and the four athletes with the best scores would be designated as the athletes to participate in the Games. The weather in Harbin is cold, and the ground freezes in October every year. The athletes stopped practicing last year as soon as it froze. There was not much time for practice after the ice thawed this year. The athletes' performance was therefore worse than before. The most obvious example is the senior men's player Wang Mingshen. His 400-meter time last year was 53.2 seconds, his 800-meter time was 2 minutes and 0 seconds, and his 1,500-meter time was 4 minutes and 22 seconds. On this day, except for the 1,500-meter, which was not contested, his 400-meter time dropped to 56.8 seconds, and his 800-meter time dropped to 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Sun Guiyun's 200-meter time was 29.1 seconds last year, and her high jump was 1.26 meters. Although her 200-meter time broke the national record on this day, it had dropped to 31.4 seconds, and her high jump was only 1.15 meters. She had not practiced the 50-meter. Wu Meixian and Sun Guiyun were too tired to participate in the 100-meter. However, Wu and Sun will still participate in this event when they attend as representatives in the future. Wu Meixian's long jump dropped to 3.95 meters, and Liu Jingzhen's shot put dropped to 6.78 meters (Liu won first place in the four-province joint competition last year with a score of 7.58 meters). All of these were due to a lack of practice and the fact that the competition did not meet their expectations. Another reason was that the rain was too heavy and the ground was slippery, resulting in average scores across the board. The following are the top two results of the day:</p>
<p>Women's Division</p>
<p>50 meters: Xiao Shuling 7 seconds, Wu Meixian 7.1 seconds, Wang Yuan 7.3 seconds, Xiao Shufang 7.3 seconds. All four in this event broke the national record.</p>

<h3>The Eastern Expedition of the Liangjiang Girls' School Basketball Team (2)</h3>
<p>(By Huang Jiping, dispatched from Tokyo on May 1st)</p>
<p>Victory Over Takehaya with a Score of 20 to 15 - Using Men's Rules</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The Liangjiang Girls' School basketball team, on their eastern expedition, defeated the Prefectural Women's Normal School in Nagasaki on April 26th with a score of 19 to 10. The overseas Chinese community in Nagasaki took great pride in this victory and presented flowers, fruits, and other gifts to express their congratulations. That evening, when the entire team boarded the ship at 5:00 PM, Consul Wang and dozens of other overseas Chinese came to the port to see them off. On the afternoon of the 27th, at 4:00 PM, the ship arrived in Kobe. Consul General Zhou Jue, Vice Consul Ren Jiafeng, Bao Zhenqing, Zeng Yanbi, and over fifty students and teachers from the Prefectural First Girls' High School were already waiting. After landing, they went to a tea party at the consulate. In the evening, the consulate prepared a feast to welcome the players. At 9:50 PM, they departed by night train, accompanied by Mr. Bao, passing through Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, and other places, and arrived directly in Tokyo on the morning of the 28th. The All Japan Basketball Association, overseas students, and the press welcomed them. Reporters competed to take photographs. After arriving at the Japan Women's Christian Association, Mr. Asano, the managing director of the Basketball Association, came to discuss the competition schedule and frequency. Previously, our side had stated that women's basketball rules should be used to conform to the uniform global standards. However, the other side firmly refused to acknowledge this and only allowed one team from the Women's Christian Association to use women's rules. There was no choice but to acquiesce. As a result of the negotiations between the two sides, the schedule was determined as follows:</p>
<p>April 29th, 2:00 PM: Welcome party by the All Japan Basketball Association</p>
<p>April 30th, 6:00 PM: Liangjiang vs. Takehaya (Prefectural Second Girls' High School)</p>
<p>May 1st, 6:00 PM: Liangjiang vs. Seikei (Ochanomizu Girls' High School)</p>
<p>May 3rd, 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM: Welcome party by the Oriental Women's Association and the Chinese Embassy; 6:00 PM: Liangjiang vs. Prefectural First Girls' High School</p>
<p>May 4th, 7:00 PM: Liangjiang vs. Women's Christian Association</p>
<p>With the competition schedule finalized, they moved to the Nichi-ka Gakkai for accommodation. In the afternoon, representatives visited the Chinese Embassy in Japan, the Chinese Youth Association, and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. April 29th was the Japanese Emperor's Birthday. At 8:00 AM, they went to the Sasaki training ground to watch the military parade, which included a total of 15,000 elite soldiers from the army, infantry, artillery, cavalry, engineering, and logistical units. At 8:30 AM, the Emperor arrived in a horse-drawn carriage, and a grand musical performance began. The audience of over 100,000 people respectfully paid their respects in a solemn manner. The Emperor then rode around for a week, and the soldiers practiced for an hour before finishing. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, they attended the welcome party by the All Japan Basketball Association. Players and coaches from Takehaya, Seikei, and First Girls' High School, totaling over 100 guests, were present. Both sides gave sincere speeches and entertainment. At 5:00 PM, the party ended on a happy note. On the morning of April 30th, the team visited the Ministry of Education's Japanese League of Boys and Girls' Organizations. Director Count Mishima exchanged commemorative books (the books were presented by the headquarters of the Chinese Party Boy Scouts). Mr. Gu Zheng asked about the history, current situation, and future plans of the Japanese Boy Scout movement. Mr. Mishima answered each question in detail, saying that the Japanese Boy Scout movement has a history of over 80 years, with a total of over 600 groups and about 80,000 members, divided into Boy Scout groups and youth training. The former, in addition to receiving training in Boy Scout courses and skills, places great emphasis on the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and the Classic of Filial Piety. The latter emphasizes military skills as preparation for future conscription. He then showed the registration form of the World Boy Scout Organization and asked why our country has not yet registered. He expressed the hope that our country would register as soon as possible for formal international contact. They said that they were very satisfied with the spirit of the Tongji and Hujiang University Boy Scouts who had come to Japan in the past. However, they did not approve of a certain Boy Scout group from Guangdong coming to Japan to conduct Party propaganda, as it was not purely Boy Scout training. That evening, at 6:20 PM, the team played against the Takehaya team in the gymnasium of the First Girls' High School. There were over 1,000 spectators, mostly from the overseas Chinese community. The Takehaya team is the Tokyo champion team and has a strong team and is hard to beat, and they were using men's rules. The overseas students initially worried that Liangjiang would be no match. Unexpectedly, Liangjiang won with a score of 20 to 15, bringing glory to the women of China. No wonder the overseas students cheered and celebrated. The following is an excerpt from the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun about the decisive battle between the two armies, which shows the situation. The Liangjiang team had just come overseas, had traveled a long distance, and had only rested for one day before starting the competition, but they were full of energy and deserved praise. They were physically stronger than Takehaya, but their shooting and passing were not yet perfect, so they missed many opportunities. Takehaya's defense was too strong, and the ball was often taken by Liangjiang. In addition, Liangjiang used their height to gain many opportunities. It is said that Liangjiang usually used women's rules in China. This time, they were using men's rules for the first time, and they were able to defeat the enemy, which is truly admirable. In the first round, Takehaya won with a score of 3 to 0. From the second round, Liangjiang gradually gained the upper hand because Takehaya's passing was not good and they did not pay attention to the enemies in the back. Liangjiang's advance and retreat were more agile than Takehaya's. In the third round, Liangjiang's Long Jingxiong committed four fouls and was sent off. Then Wang Lan was also sent off. Tu Yunsheng replaced her, and their momentum became stronger, and they finally defeated Takehaya with a score of 20 to 15. In general, the performance of Liangjiang in this battle was good due to Shao Jinying's fast passing, Tu Yunsheng's bravery and good fighting skills, and Yang Ren's steady shooting. Takehaya committed fewer fouls, but their height was uneven, but their courageous spirit was admirable. The skills of Takashima and Yamazaki and the speed of their running were indeed the roles of the whole team. Their results are as follows:</p>
<p>Liangjiang Team</p>
<p>Name Position Fouls Points</p>
<p>Shao Jinying Right Forward 2 7</p>
<p>Yang Ren Left Forward 1 3</p>
<p>Long Jingxiong Center 4 2</p>
<p>Zhuang Shuyu Right Forward 1 2</p>
<p>Xiang Dawei Right Forward 0 0</p>
<p>Wang Lan Left Forward 4 0</p>
<p>Tu Yunsheng Left Forward 0 6</p>
<p>Takehaya Team</p>
<p>Name Position Fouls Points</p>
<p>Takashima Left Forward 2 7</p>
<p>Koide Left Forward 0 0</p>
<p>Yamazaki Center 1 4</p>
<p>Sagata Right Forward 3 4</p>
<p>Ichimura Left Forward 0 0</p>
<p>Kodama Right Forward 0 0</p>
<p>Total Upper Half 8-5</p>
<p>Lower Half 12-10</p>
<h3>Basketball Star Li Zuqi Returns to China</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Zuqi, the captain of the Chinese basketball team who was all the rage a few years ago, went to the United States in the summer of 1929 to study business administration and accounting at Stanford and the University of Southern California. In his spare time, he also served as a basketball coach at the University of Southern California. He earned a master's degree in commerce this spring. His dissertation, which was tens of thousands of words long, was praised by many people there. Mr. Li arrived in Shanghai on the Ryuta Maru the day before yesterday. It is said that he will take a senior position at a bank in Shanghai and serve as the director of the business department and physical education instructor at his alma mater, Chih Chih University.</p>

<h3>Farewell Poem for Jiaoli</h3>
<p>— A Lowly Scholar from Weitang</p>
<p>In the fourth month of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the spring city had not yet fallen, and the flavor of Mingyue tea was just returning (Mingyue Spring is where I often drink tea). I read in the newspaper that Miss Shi Zhiying, a female worker from the Jiaoli Weicheng Company in Yuanhu, comes from a poor family and is a cold woman from Yuexi. She was elected by the people and appointed as a guest of the National Assembly (elected by the trade union as a representative to the National Assembly). Even fei and chu are not abandoned, and enough is asked of the zao. With the lun in sight, she will travel by stagecoach. At the Lingshan Dharma Assembly, the heavenly maiden must spread her flowers. In the micro-recitation of the swamp, I dare to offer the song of the people of Ba. The small team of ten kinds of immortals is traveling, and the sounds of the void are blown down for no reason. The map of position and industry opens the face of the green history, and the Heavenly Grandson personally sees the Shang Yao capital. The small Kangs are Zhi Zhi Xiao Kangqian, and Hongbo boasts that Luo Sihai is wise. The universe is greatly the same, and today is different from the past, and the new imperial virtue is the people's power. Mei Village's boudoir recital has long been silent (Wu Meicun wrote the Yuanhu Boudoir Recital for Huang Jieling, a famous beauty in Jiaxing). Zhuzha's style has already been unable to bear the gentle spring breeze. Who alone is outstanding? Adding to the palm of the hand, the twilight of the Yanyu Tower is misty, and the sound of the machine and the shadow of the lamp are beautiful. At one time, the heroes all pushed down, and they cried to the end of the road, and their eyes were clear. The seven-xiang clouds are far away from the years, and the tears of the Nanhai whale silk are endless. The expectation of the people of the world is strong, and if this person does not come out, how can the heart be convenient? Lan Hui only cherishes the feelings of the world, but how can the fragrant first chirp? The grievances of a thousand autumns must be stated, and the unfulfilled things of pressing the line and pulling the vine are not yet completed. Do not resent the boiling cicadas and frogs, and let the clouds and rain chirp. Who belongs to the unparalleled national scholar? At the first river, ask who washes the yarn. The willows by the West Lake are soft, and the hoofs under the Stone City are proud. The title is signed by the female consultant, and the powder has no face to laugh at the Six Dynasties. The eyebrows and ends of the flowers are swept with electricity, and the tongue is full of waves, and the cranes dance in groups. The creation of spring is to brew vitality, and at one time, the reds and purples are also colorful. The eight Confucians and three inkstones gather a thousand points, and a group of scholars walk on the high hills of Jixia. They argue about prices and names in the imperial court, and they pity the long sleeves that are not as good as you. The chicken and dog Yuncheng girl wind, the ups and downs of the Yangtze River. The serenade is a string of peaceful songs, remember to take Yu Yu's play to achieve great harmony. The lyrics and poems are useless in Jiang Guan, and the heroic aspirations are exhausted, and the day is late. A beautiful woman is absolutely worried, and she is worried about singing national poems to the desolate city (my friend Zhang Fengjin signed his upside-down and horizontal writing, which is appropriate and uneven, as a poem of or style or living body. Wanting to revitalize and differ from ancient and modern, the world has not paid attention to this. Here, I support the example of advocating national art and national medicine, and labeling the two characters of national poetry. The people have a spirit, and there are few supporters). The dirty dust has not yet stopped, and it is startling to spread the Hong shadow to recognize the true face (Jun Qianying's party newspapers are competing to promote it). The smoke and clouds have become lonely for thousands of years, and a piece of human emotion is annoying. I am tired of raising my star eyes to look at the rivers and mountains, and my old childlike heart is still idle. I am afraid that the romantic feelings will disappear, and the poetic sentences are wonderful in the ring (not paid).</p>

<h3>Half a Day at Longhua</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, Mr. Wang Xiaolai invited me to visit the Shanghai City Third Grand Review and Grand Camp of the Chinese Boy Scouts, and to take the opportunity to tour Longhua Temple. Having lived in the city for a long time, I felt a different kind of flavor strolling through the fields, so I recorded the events as follows:</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM that afternoon, we departed from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and arrived at the entrance of the Longhua Grand Parade Ground in about twenty minutes. The colorful archway soared into the clouds. Upon entering, the tents stood like a forest. Guards were stationed at each, standing upright with sticks in front of the tents, energetic and lively, both male and female. On the reviewing stand, hundreds of prizes were displayed, mainly divided into four categories: silver shields, mirror frames, silver cups, and small flags. The inscriptions on them mostly related to awards. The dazzling array was too much to remember all of them. To the left of the stand was the office, divided into general affairs and assessment sections, with four or five people working inside. After signing in, we were led by staff members to visit the camping locations of each troop in detail. It was said that there were a total of thirty-two troops, with over three thousand people. The tent styles of each troop varied, some round, some square, some large, some small. The boy scouts in camp were either watching wall newspapers, playing soccer, playing the harmonica, or jumping rope, full of spirit and laughing freely. The girl scouts inside the tents all had their blankets folded in piles, while the boys all had their blankets spread flat on the ground. Near the tents, stoves were dug into the ground, similar to the military. The tents of the boy scouts from the affiliated middle school of Shanghai University were different from the others, tall like houses. It was said that after visiting Japan, they drew the design and instructed a factory in Hongkou to imitate it, measuring eighteen feet long, thirty feet wide, and the height was also proportionate. Mr. Wang was very happy to see it and inquired about the price in detail in order to prepare for manufacturing. Outside the tent, a wooden frame was set up with cowhide hanging in the middle, where visitors could write their names to leave a souvenir. At 4:00 PM, we visited Longhua Temple. The temple was extremely crowded with worshippers. On the right side of the Great Hero Hall, at the place that had been burned, there was a shrine. Although the surroundings had been burned, the idol still existed. Tourists all worshipped it. Upon closer inspection, it was Ji Gong, holding a broken fan with a playful and smiling face. Other idols were placed in the open air, large and small, all holding copper coins in their hands. Because the money box had been burned, worshippers had no way to insert their candle money, so they all handed it to the Buddha's hands to keep it on their behalf. Every few minutes, the temple monk would carry a basket and walk around, like collecting taxes, and be searched and taken away. The five hundred Arhats were still safe and sound, but they were wearing red hats, and it was unknown what the intention was. On that day, the Tenth Emperor Assembly was being held. A huge paper house was built in the courtyard, with halls and side rooms no different from the real thing. All the appliances inside the house were available in various sizes. Hundreds of people stood around the house, holding incense and wearing yellow cloth incense bags, chanting Amitabha. To the west of the hall, there was a stone archway more than forty feet high, very exquisite, which was a memorial碑 to the fallen officers and soldiers of the Thirty-second Army of the National Revolutionary Army. Next to it were two stone tablets, both engraved with four characters, one saying "(The Blood of Martyrs)" and the other saying "(The Flower of Doctrine)," both donated by the Whampoa Military Academy Alumni Association. When we returned, the city was lit with thousands of lights, so I dipped my pen and made a record to leave a trace.</p>
<h3>Record of the Snake Market in Africa</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Snakes are poisonous creatures that people avoid for fear of getting close. However, there are markets where venomous snakes and giant pythons are displayed for people to choose from. Wouldn't people consider it a strange thing to hear about? In Africa, there are markets selling snakes, and the spring season is the busiest time for these snake markets. The situation there is quite interesting, so I will describe it as follows:</p>
<p>Overview of Snake Markets: In terms of the snake selling business in Africa, the most prosperous place is undoubtedly Cape Town, and within Cape Town, Adderley Street is the most concentrated area for snake markets. Where do these venomous snakes and giant pythons come from? This is also worth exploring. Most of them are supplied by snake hunters, and this year's snake market is dominated by the acquisitions of snake hunting expert Bain. When he led hunters to hunt snakes in the Kalahari Desert, he experienced hardships, but the result was a large batch of giant snakes. This adventurous spirit is admirable. Bain is a seasoned snake hunter who has ventured to various parts of Africa many times to find snakes, and has long regarded snake hunting as a commonplace task. Moreover, this time he also had a snake company cooperating with him in accordance with federal law, so the number of snakes obtained was more than in previous years.</p>
<p>Venomous Snake Exhibition: Among the snake merchants in Africa, the largest business is the Snake Park. The Snake Park is also a company, mostly operating with pooled shares. Those who set up snake parks recruit various venomous snakes and giant pythons and display them in the park for people to choose from. The income is not only from selling snakes. When the snake market is busy, various exotic snakes are displayed in the park for a venomous snake exhibition, and the people who visit come one after another. The price of admission tickets is also considerable. This year, there are especially many snakes in Africa, so the snake market is even more developed. However, snake markets in Africa have always been controlled by zoos and snake parks. Currently, the number of people running snake parks has also increased a lot. However, in recent years, the supply of reptiles has exceeded the demand, so the selling price has decreased day by day. Even the largest snakes, such as pythons, are only worth half a crown (currency name) per foot. The snake parks have printed catalogs for various types of snakes with different values. Among the people who buy snakes, most are doctors, zookeepers, and museum curators. The income of the African people from snake prices each year is also quite considerable.</p>
<p>Short Dispatch: I previously read in the newspaper that Germany captured a repeat offender who murdered women, Qiu Erdian. Investigations revealed that as many as nine women died at his hands in one year. This is also a foreign anecdote. Yesterday, I watched the premiere of the new film (A Western Hermaphrodite) at the Paris Cinema on Avenue Joffre. The plot coincided with the legendary case. The protagonist, the German star Hua Tuo Lila, who is as famous as Qi Ning, gave a profound performance that was moving. The background photography was also extremely beautified. There was a scene of a raging storm outdoors and a transvestite committing crimes indoors, which was indeed infinitely powerful to watch. This film will be released publicly on the 7th. The cinema has also recently collected many silent films and selected them to suit the psychology of the audience. (She Yu)</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of India (46)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>For three days, I will be returning to Benares. The English women and students were busy copying my lecture notes. Fei Libu's son wrote a paper describing my theory and mentioning the words of Mohammed: "If a person seeks knowledge, he must go to China." He believes that Chinese culture can save the world. I also hope that more Westerners will believe this.</p>
<p>On the 4th, I returned to Benares. At night in the train, I wore thick thermal underwear and cotton robes, but still felt cold. In the train, I met students, teachers, and lawyers who were very happy to talk about China and expressed their desire to learn Chinese and admire Sun Yat-sen because Indians long for revolution. Many Indians who are lawyers are very wealthy, so there are lawyers everywhere, filling the streets. I also don't understand why Indians have such high morals, yet there are so many lawsuits that require lawyers to handle them.</p>
<p>On the 5th afternoon, I arrived in Benares and went to the Indian Church Ramakrishna Mission. This church has been under construction for seven years and was founded in the United States by its great virtue, Krishna. It has a hospital and a rehabilitation center, covering half a square mile, with lush flowers and trees. It is said that it has six or seven branches in the United States. This association is divided from the United States, and the funds are supplied by the United States. Americans are already happy to do good deeds around the world, and Indians are confident that their philosophy is enough to conquer the world. Europeans and Americans are captivated by the trend and are willing to be disciples to spread their teachings.</p>
<p>On the 6th, I visited the Indian Antiquities Preservation Institute, in Indian language, Nagau Pracharim Sabha, which was introduced by an Indian named Khanna. He met me on the road and told me that he wanted to talk about Buddhist affairs, showing me many Buddha statues, and said that he wanted to go to Tibet to work for Buddhism and did not want to be elsewhere. Indian prophets have predicted that India will gain freedom from Buddhism in the future, so Indians are very happy with Buddhism everywhere. In particular, some people suspect that the person who gets freedom from Buddhism is Chinese or Indian themselves. However, they are eager for Chinese to come to preach and are happy to receive Chinese. When Tagore came to China in the past, he once said that his distant ancestors had planted seeds of kindness with the East decades ago, and today he will reap its fruits. To this day, I am very ashamed of this statement. If there are still Buddhist disciples in the East who have a conscience, they should respond to the demands of the Indians.</p>

<h3>The Hawthorne Detective Agency: The Bend (7)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>(3) In the Police Station</p>
<p>We entered the police station, but unexpectedly there was another small setback. The chief was not in the station, and no one was in charge for a while. This misunderstanding was clearly not easy to explain. I loudly said to the detective (You go find the chief quickly. I don't have time to wait. You did a good job tonight. Get ready to be commended). This kind of tone and attitude actually made the unreasonable detective reveal some surprise, because ordinary criminals who stepped into the police station would inevitably show some fear and trepidation. My tone and attitude were exactly the opposite. This really could not help but make him suspicious. He did indeed discuss a few words with a night watchman and sent a person out to find the chief. I was also impolite, walking straight to the telephone booth in the watchman's room. First, I called Hawthorne's residence to ask if he had returned home. Unfortunately, his old servant Shi Gui said that he had returned home once, but turned around and left again in a hurry. When I was calling, the detective and the night watchman were both nearby. The night watchman seemed to be more sensitive, and from my conversation with Shi Gui, he seemed to have guessed who I was. I saw him whispering a few words to the detective. The detective's face seemed to gradually change. I still ignored him and was about to make a second call when I saw a person walking in from outside. The person was wearing a dark blue Chinese tunic suit with some short beards and a pair of toric glasses. This person was the chief of the Fourth Precinct. His face was very familiar. I had clearly seen him somewhere before, but I couldn't remember his name for a while. As soon as the chief walked in, the detective respectfully took a step forward and wanted to report the situation, but the chief waved his hand and walked straight to me, took off his felt hat, extended his hand to shake hands with me, and exclaimed in a very affectionate tone (Mr. Bao, long time no see. It's rare for you to come here). I was embarrassed again. I couldn't remember his name and didn't know how to address him, but he was very alert and volunteered (Brother is Zhang Baoquan. Three years ago, when I was in Hangzhou, wasn't it with the help of you gentlemen that the case of the Xiyou Villa was solved?) As he spoke, he pulled me into his office and very diligently invited me to sit down. Only then did I remember that he had come to Shanghai for the mysterious murder in the villa, and Hawthorne and I had indeed helped him. However, because I had contact with many people, I couldn't remember his name.</p>

<p>Many Changes in the Gold Market</p>
<p>The market trend has been volatile and unpredictable. Yesterday, after the Western Chamber of Commerce Spring Race was over, the gold exchange operated as usual in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The bidding situation was unpredictable, sometimes advancing and sometimes retreating, with fluctuations of two or three taels to six or seven taels. As a result, it fell slightly by two taels. Major players supplied more than they demanded, and the market was calm in the morning. The silver market rose slightly. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market was obviously stable but secretly contracted. In addition, Luo and others tended to sell, and there were rumors that a certain bank wanted to sell its cash reserves. The market situation suddenly declined frequently, falling six or seven taels. At noon, buyers suddenly became active, and the exchange rate turned stable, showing a good trend. The price then rose from 733 taels to 39 taels. The overseas market once broke through the 40 tael mark, but the selling pressure was strong, and the market became weak again. In the end, it was 33-34 taels. The waves were not small, and the industry's will was low. It is said that the big bars may rise this morning.</p>
<p>The opening was stable, then fell and stabilized again. The opening price for the June contract was slightly higher by five qian, at 736.5 taels. The large bars were the same as before. The silver price only rose by one-eighth, and the private telegrams were the same. It is said that the English silver was looking long yesterday, but today's telegram was not. Therefore, the gold price stabilized. Then there was a rise and fall of more than one tael, from 6.2 qian to 7 taels, and then back to 5.8 qian. Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Chengyong, etc. all sold, and suddenly Wupin, Tianfeng, Yongyuan, Maoyong, etc. bought in, so the price was raised by 3 taels, totaling 39 taels. However, Yongheng, Dadecheng, etc. sold, and the price was depreciated by one or two taels. The shilling announcement did not change, and it was only 37.2 qian. The domestic market was flat. Sumitomo bought English gold for July at 134375, which immediately rose to 8 taels. At 9:50, it began to weaken, all because Yu Da, Hengxing, Xinxin, Hengyuan, Chengyong, Yongheng, etc. were selling, and the English gold had shown a loose contraction trend. Each bank bought 4375 to half a penny. Mitsui issued Dalian 1 tael 5 qian 7 fen 75, which led to a drop of 5 taels. At 10:10, it was 32.89 qian. Later, Hengxing and others slightly advanced, returning to 2 taels and 0. At 10:20, it was 35 taels. However, Yongheng, Yuancheng, Bingxing, etc. were tireless in selling. In particular, English gold was issued by the Huah Bank from 4375 to half a penny. At 10:45, it was only 32.2 qian. Suddenly, Wu, Cuichang, Yongqian, Changxiang, Zhifeng, Yong, etc. came to buy again. Because Mitsui, Taiwan, McCall, etc. accepted English gold at 134375 and 375, the price rose sharply, soaring 7 taels until noon, when it was 39.5 qian. Then it depreciated by 1.23 qian. By the close of the market, it was 38.9 qian. The announced price was still 778.2 qian. It is estimated that the interest was 40 to 45 or 6 taels, and the afternoon close was 40 taels.</p>
<p>Once Excited, Finally Falling: The afternoon opening was 39 taels, then 38 taels. Zhifeng, Yong, etc. sold out. Suddenly, Yuanmao Yong and others entered the market to buy in, and the situation suddenly improved, reaching 41.5 qian. Afterwards, the Indian exchange rate rose by two or three annas, and Yu Dachang, Sheng Yongqian, Changxiang, Yuancheng and other major players bravely sold out. Because the telegram from India sold English gold at a price of 4375, people's hearts were trending downward, and the price fell 7 taels. At nearly 4 o'clock, it was 34.5 qian. Retail investors and others chased in and immediately pulled up 2.5 taels. Afterwards, Yuancheng and others sold even more fiercely, falling another 3 taels. At more than 4:20, it was only 33.8 qian. Then it rose by 6-7 taels to 4.5 taels. By the close of the market at 4:30, it was 34 taels, a further drop of 2 taels compared to the previous afternoon, and another cut of 2 taels, totaling 3 taels and zero. According to the maximum price of 41.5 taels and the minimum price of 32.2 qian for the whole day, there was a difference of 9.3 qian. Looking back at the price of goods, the morning price was 36.5 taels, the afternoon close was 8.9 qian, and the afternoon 8.7 qian, and the close was 3 taels. The quoted price was estimated to be 40 to 44 or 5 taels, and the book value was 39 taels in the morning and 34 taels in the afternoon, with a supplemental water of 37 taels in the afternoon and 32 taels.</p>
<p>The Inflow and Outflow of Various Numbers Was Unusually Chaotic: The transactions of various numbers were diverse. It is estimated that Zhifeng Yong, Yuancheng Yong first sold and then entered. Qian Changxiang, Cuichang Yong, Futai Heng, Wanxing, Yuanheng mostly bought in. Tianfeng Yong, Yuantai also entered. Shunli, Hengxing, Hengyu, Fuchang, Dadecheng had frequent inflows and outflows. Yuanmao Yong, Tong Taichang, Yongheng, Xinxin, Yuancheng, Yuankangxiang all sold out. In the afternoon, Yuantai, Yuankangxiang, Wanxing, Yuanmao Yong all entered. Yuancheng, Changsheng Yong, Qian Changxiang all exited. Zhifeng Yong, Shunli, Hengxing, Fuyu sometimes bought and sold. The inflows and outflows of goods were unequal. Speculator Wu first entered and then exited. Luo mostly shorted. Guangbang only had 600-700 inflows and outflows. Dalianbang had a total of 1500-1600 inflows and outflows, which balanced out.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Rate Has a Trend of Potential Relaxation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the English silver rate did not change, and the American silver rate rose again. The exchange rates all rose to the HSBC listed price without any change. However, the domestic market was flat in the early morning, then weakened and tended to stabilize. Therefore, the gold market was weak but firm, and then turned firm and then weakened in the afternoon. Therefore, the exchange market was loose and discounted. As a result, the English gold was slightly longer than the previous afternoon by 0.0625, the American gold was 0.125, and the Japanese gold was slightly lower by 0.075. The Huashang trade was not deserted, but the supply and demand were unequal. It is estimated that the English gold was traded for more than 200,000 pounds. Banks such as Sumitomo, HSBC, Huabi, Mitsui, McCall, Zhengjin, Taiwan, etc. all accepted it, while Zhongfu, Shanghai Mail Company, etc. mostly sold it. There were telegrams from Mumbai in the morning and afternoon selling it. The American gold was traded for 300,000-400,000 yuan, and each bank had inflows and outflows. The Japanese gold was only traded for several hundred thousand yuan. Dalianbang slightly purchased Dalian tickets. It is said that the spring race is over, so it is open for business as usual in the afternoon. The market situation seems to be potentially loose and out of control.</p>
<p>The English exchange rate in the domestic market was calculated to be a fluctuation of 0.125 throughout the day. In the morning, the asking price was 1 shilling 3 pence 375, and the buying price was 4375. Sumitomo bought July 4375, and Mitsui Macxing did the same price for May. Sumitomo Huabi bought July and August 4375 to half a penny. Zhongfu sold the July same price, but the gold price had fallen to 33 taels. Later, Mitsui Macxing Zhengjin entered July again and entered 4375 to 375. Therefore, the bidding gold was hyped up to 38 or 9 taels. Zhengjin Taiwan bought July half a penny, and Shanghai sold July and August 375 to 4375. The afternoon close was the same as the morning market. In the afternoon, Macxing sold June, July and August 375. Datong sold and the Chinese-French entered into a deal for June 375. Huabi entered July 4375 (Mumbai sold). At about 4:30, HSBC absorbed June and July 4375 to half a penny. By the close of the market, the asking price was 4375 and the buying price was half a penny.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Drops in the Morning and Rises in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The yarn market dropped in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but actual sales were not very smooth. Because the time is in the off-season, people's hearts are relatively indifferent. The general retail investors still tend to sell. However, a certain major businessman tightened up and did not let go this month because the yarn factory was losing money, and there was an intention to take delivery. However, the sales of 10-count coarse yarn have been greatly reduced, and the existing stock is thicker. Therefore, according to the general trend, the current situation is still fluctuating.</p>
<p>Man Biao Rises by Six or Seven Qian: The Man Biao opened in the morning market, and the American cotton rose slightly, but the popularity was still flat. Each month fell by three, four, five or six qian. In the afternoon, the yarn market rose due to the rise in raw materials, and people's hearts were tight. Each month rose by six or seven qian to one tael, one or two qian. The total trading volume for the day was 50,850 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 1,100 bales, Dafu 500 bales, Changfeng 1,000 bales, Tongxing 500 bales, Xiesheng 750 bales, and Yichang 550 bales. Heshen bought 1,000 bales, Shenxin 950 bales, Taixing 750 bales, Gengfeng 2,250 bales, and Yicheng 650 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Suddenly Turns Bullish</h3>
<p>The cotton market suddenly surged because Japanese firm Toyo Cotton Mill increased its bullish purchases and market rumors spread that a large batch of "fire engine" cotton was being shipped to Hankou. This caused market tension, and small retail short sellers covered their positions, leading to a significant rise in the market. However, local factories in this area were hesitant and showed little demand.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Cotton Rises Seven or Eight Cash</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard Cotton market opened higher due to a slight rise in US cotton prices, with strong bullish sentiment. Prices rose by 1.5 cash each. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was dense, and buying interest was slightly firmer. Prices for all months rose by 6-7 cash. Total transactions amounted to 73,200 bales. It was noted that Da Chang sold 2,300 bales, De Ji sold 2,400 bales, Geng Feng sold 3,100 bales, and Gong Tai sold 1,000 bales.

<p>Rice: Imported Rice Sales Stagnate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market was slow. Due to clear weather, rice shipments from downstream areas arrived in Shanghai continuously, and local merchants became cautious and adopted a wait-and-see approach. Moreover, it was reported that the Japanese had already procured about 20,000 dan, and there was no significant demand for further consumption, indicating that the market had reached saturation. Therefore, transactions came to a halt. The overall market was supported only by local merchants dealing with early Jiangxi machine-milled rice at a price of 10 yuan 0.07 fen per 102 bags. Other transactions were nonexistent, and there were no hopes for improvement.</p>
<h3>Starch: More Sellers in the Futures Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the starch market opened in the morning with a steady, firm trend in various months. Foreign wheat prices were slightly better, and the weather was not excessively favorable. Outside speculation remained strong, and buying interest was quite active for a time. However, as merchants from other provinces released their holdings, the market weakened. When the market opened in the afternoon, with bright sunshine, more sellers emerged. Speculative holdings were gradually released, and various months showed a tendency to soften. As the weather remained clear, the outlook was still bearish. As a result, the current month fell slightly by 1 fen 2.5 li compared to the previous day, June fell slightly by 1 fen 2.5 li, July fell slightly by 1 fen 8 li, August fell slightly by 7 li, September fell slightly by 1 fen 5 li, and October fell slightly by 7 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Weather Clears, Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market opened in the morning with a relatively stable market for various months. Foreign wheat prices were slightly stronger, and although the weather was clearing, the sunshine was not yet fully favorable, so sentiment remained calm. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, the May contract showed a tendency to soften, as the weather was favorable and there were hopes for clear skies. Prices for all months weakened. It is observed that if the weather does not change, the market will remain bearish, as the current weather conditions seem to have a bearing on the new wheat harvest. As a result, the current month fell slightly by 2 fen 6 li compared to the previous day, July fell slightly by 2 fen 8 li, August fell slightly by 3 fen, and September and October fell slightly by 2 fen.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar Opened Quite Firm</p>
<p>Japanese Sugar Shipments Resume with 5,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from production areas indicated that Cuban raw sugar prices had fallen further by 0.3125 compared to previous reports. New York sugar futures for September also fell by 0.03, and prices for other months also fell by 0.04. Java spot and futures prices remained unchanged. At the Association market, Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white saw a slight increase in buying and selling. Sellers quoted prices slightly tighter at 10 taels 0.05 qian, but buying interest was weak, resulting in limited transactions and a continued downward trend in the overall market. No. 20 medium white sugar was also steady at 10 taels. Japanese sugar transactions were relatively brisk. N Mark: 10 taels 0.06 qian. SH Mark: 10 taels 0.0175 qian. J Mark: 11 taels. TX Mark: 10 taels 0.0825 qian. TM Mark: 10 taels 0.0225 qian. YT Mark: 10 taels 0.05 qian. YP Mark: 10 taels 0.09 qian. YRO Mark: 9 taels 0.095 qian. The market remained stable. Factory sales increased. Foreign firms sold 5,000 bags of Central Factory AEAR two-mark bundled with June delivery Japanese sugar at a price of 4.4 Japanese yen. The market was unremarkable. Maochang Trading sold several hundred bags of local factory crystal granulated green sugar at a price of 9 taels 2.05 qian per bag. Also, several dozen bags of large-sized No. 3 local factory crystal sugar were sold at a price of 12 taels 6.05 qian per bag. Huaxin Trading sold over a thousand bags of raw red sugar at a price of 9 taels per bag. Market sentiment was generally firm. It was rumored that raw red sugar prices were being raised by 2 qian.</p>
<p>Silk, Tea, and Local Produce: Tea Factories Commence Operations</p>
<p>Local tea factories in Shanghai began operations yesterday, with over 300 dan of raw tea arriving from Sui'an, Huzhou, and Hangzhou. Tea factories such as Gongsheng, Wanchengxiang, Yongtai, Jusheng, Shengji, and Tongyifeng have all started production in quick succession to meet the market demand for new tea. The atmosphere is quite lively.</p>
<h3>Xiuning Tea Production Suffers Losses</h3>
<p>Xiuning County is a famous tea-producing area in Anhui Province, bordering Wuyuan, Tuochuan, and Shuilan. The tea produced in the Xiaoxiuning, Zuolong, and Youlong areas is of comparable quality to Wuyuan tea. This year, due to the reduced number of tea firms in Tunxi and low tea prices, local mountain households are harvesting tender leaves early to avoid unsold stock and falling prices. According to local mountain households, tea production this year is uneven in terms of timing and quantity, and the estimated output will be only 70% of previous years' harvests. (May 1st)</p>
<h3>Wuyuan New Tea Harvesting Halted Due to Rain</h3>
<p>New tea harvesting in Wuyuan County was started by mountain households several days ago, but due to continuous rain, the harvest has been greatly reduced. Frying and baking the leaves requires a lot of firewood and labor. Yesterday (30th), there was a heavy downpour, with significant water accumulation in the tea gardens. The weather also turned from hot to cold, and the tea-picking workers were shivering and unable to work. Harvesting was mostly halted. The weather is still cold today, and the tea buds are suppressed by the cold, slowing growth. Most mountain households have stopped harvesting and processing to avoid producing inferior goods.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Green Tea Trading Has Begun</h3>
<p>Green tea harvesting has recently started in various areas of Zhejiang Province. New tea from the mountains in Ningbo and Fenghua has reached the market. However, the tea leaves from these areas are of lower quality, and buyers are not very active. New prices opened in May at 28 yuan, lower than last year's prices by 4-5 yuan. However, the trend is expected to continue downward.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Qimen black tea has been packed by various firms in recent days. According to a telegram from Qimen, the first batch of new goods departed on the 6th, mostly transported via the Yangtze River. A large batch of Qimen tea is expected to arrive in Shanghai next week.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: More Gains Than Losses</p>
<p>Osaka prices are high... Local buyers are quite active</p>
<p>The piece goods market in Shanghai suddenly became firm yesterday, mainly because prices in Osaka were rising sharply. Fine broadcloth and tribute cloth were both up by about 0.01, leading to higher sentiment among local merchants. Buyers from the Yangtze River region were actively purchasing. Transactions in tribute cloth reached over 150 pieces. Goose Hunter cloths reached a price of 3.055 qian by the afternoon, and Moganshan cloths reached a price of 3.0575 qian, a rise of over 0.01 in two days. Printed cloth became more popular. Buyers from inland provinces were actively purchasing Shuangtonglu cloths for 5.35 taels and Lun Chang cloths for 5.1 taels. There was very little spot inventory in the market. Striped pongee became increasingly firm. Lakeside Pavilion and Yang Guifei cloths were sold out. Qingguan Mirror cloths opened at a price of 3.095 qian. Among all the goods, only printed colored poplin from Tinting arriving in Shanghai was slightly softer, with inferior patterns priced at 0.02 qian for goods entering the customs. However, the highest-quality goods still fetched around 0.025 qian. Yuan Guang inclined Western umbrellas were in high demand, and there was a shortage of inventory in Shanghai. Feng Bo Ting cloths were sold out at 7.85 taels, Xiaoyao Jin cloths were sold at 7.45 taels, and Da Yuan Bao cloths were sold at 6.05 taels. There was also strong demand for plain Western pongee, with the most fashionable goods from Gong Mao Mei selling at 0.07 qian for goods leaving the customs.</p>
<p>Hardware: HSBC Iron in Short Supply, Prices Soar</p>
<p>HSBC iron, at 200 pounds, is in short supply of spot goods recently. Purchases from various regions are exceptionally active. Market supply cannot meet demand, and prices are rising steadily. Each case is estimated at 34 taels 2.05 qian. It is rumored that bottom goods are becoming increasingly scarce and imports from overseas are low. Therefore, those involved in this business are becoming increasingly optimistic and the market is up 0.075 qian compared to the previous day, with each case estimated at 35 taels. Yesterday, tobacco companies such as Nanyang, Huacheng, and Huapin competed to hoard spot goods, leading to a further thinning of bottom goods and increasingly strong prices. It is rumored that prices have been bid up to 36 taels.</p>
<h3>Yellow Twill in High Demand</h3>
<p>With the weather gradually getting warmer, the demand for yellow twill has suddenly increased. Buyers from both local and distant regions need it, mostly to make military uniforms and Western suits. Orders for individual pieces and full boxes continue to come in. There is considerable activity in opening positions at the Guild. Old-brand "Apple" (i.e., Taihe) cloths are even more popular and firm. Yesterday, Taihe Three Lions cloths sold for 0.064 qian, Shuangfugui cloths for 0.055 qian, and Fengyu Three Fish brand cloths for 0.05275 qian. Tianxiang Da Desheng cloths sold for 0.0545 qian. Although the Zhi Da Earth old-brand cloths were priced at 0.07 qian net, it was not easy to obtain them.</p>

<h3>Premier's Bronze Statue Model</h3>
<p>Sent to Beijing for Second Review</p>
<p>The fundraising efforts by various circles in Shanghai to build a bronze statue of the Premier at the North Station have been underway for over a year. After soliciting designs by the Preparatory Committee, it was decided to adopt the design proposed by Zhang Chenbo and the model made by Jiang Xiaojian. The Committee also commissioned the manufacture of a full-scale prototype wooden statue based on Zhang's design. Subsequently, in accordance with instructions from the Central Party Headquarters that all Premier statue construction projects in various locations must be reviewed by the Central Government in advance, Committee member Mr. Ye Xiufu was assigned to take the designs, models, and self-made prototype to Beijing for review. Last month, a letter was received from the Secretariat of the Central Committee, pointing out flaws in the models of both Jiang and Zhang, and enclosing a photograph of the Premier, instructing them to send the models again after they have been remodeled according to the photograph. The Committee immediately sent letters to both individuals to comply. It is now reported that the two individuals have recently submitted the second set of models to the Committee. At the regular meeting on Monday of this week, the Committee decided to reassign Mr. Ye Xiufu to take the models to Beijing for review within the next few days so that they can be completed as soon as possible and meet the expectations of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Department to Hold</h3>
<p>(59) Commemorative Meeting</p>
<p>Tomorrow Morning at 9:00 AM at the Municipal Party Department</p>
<p>All Circles in Shanghai Must Send Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>Tomorrow (May 9th) is the 16th anniversary of the day when Japanese imperialists, taking advantage of the heated state of the European War, forced the then-Beijing puppet government to sign the Twenty-One Demands in an attempt to destroy our country. It was the first time since the founding of the Republic of China that imperialists had carried out an active aggression and inflicted the greatest humiliation on the Chinese nation. It was the day when the feudal warlords of the Republic of China colluded with imperialists to carry out their treasonous conspiracies and control the people. It cannot be said that the Chinese people were able to recognize the ugly faces of imperialism and feudal warlords and begin to work hard for the national liberation movement without the lessons given to us by this great humiliation. We should continue to redouble our efforts to achieve the ultimate goal of abolishing all unequal treaties and overthrowing imperialism. Tomorrow is the 16th anniversary. The Municipal Propaganda Department has scheduled a commemorative meeting to be held at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning on the third floor of the Municipal Party Department. All agencies, organizations, and party departments at all levels in the city should send four representatives to participate.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Investigates and Bans Japanese Fishing Vessels from Illegal Fishing</p>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Association yesterday received a document from the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, document number 128, regarding a submission stating that Japanese fishing vessels are using the names of Chinese merchants to fraudulently use the national flag and plunder marine resources. Please review and instruct for a swift resolution. The submission and attachments have been reviewed in their entirety. Regarding the case of Japanese fishing vessels fraudulently flying the Chinese flag and illegally fishing, the Shanghai Municipal Government previously reported to the Ministry via the Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Department. The Ministry has separately requested relevant departments and the Shanghai Municipal Government to stop the situation through negotiation and has drafted measures to prevent and crack down on the fraudulent activity, and has sent confidential inquiries to the Ministry of Communications. From now on, when fishing boats apply for licenses, they should first be required to present the fishing license issued by this Ministry, otherwise their application should be rejected to prevent fraudulent substitution. In addition, a confidential inquiry was sent to the Ministry of Finance to instruct all customs offices to strictly investigate and ban foreign fishing boats from fraudulently flying the Chinese flag, and to regulate the procedures for applying for temporary navigation permits. Subsequently, the Ministry of Communications replied approving the procedures, and the Ministry of Finance replied that it had instructed customs supervisors to prohibit foreign vessels under 100 tons from entering port starting May 1st. Also, regarding the item published in the Shen Bao newspaper (Japanese fishing vessels invade the waters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang), Mr. Zhuang Songfu previously sent a telegram to the Ministry. The Ministry consulted with the Navy to dispatch ships to the area and instructed the Construction Department of Zhejiang to send marine police boats to assist. The issue of Japanese people infringing on the shipping industry in Guangdong was reported to the Ministry of Communications for verification. The information should be noted.</p>
<h3>Lu Feibo Hong</h3>
<p>Talks About the Kailuan Coal Transportation Issue</p>
<p>Coal and Mining Disputes Should Be Resolved Quickly</p>
<p>Resuming Coal Transportation Is Urgent</p>
<p>Since the Kailuan Coal Mine and the Beining Railway became embroiled in a dispute, the suspension of coal transportation has lasted for two months. Shanghai's coal inventory has suddenly become scarce, and Japanese coal has taken the opportunity to increase its activities and prices. The business community is suffering greatly. However, the exact reason for the dispute between Kailuan and the Beining Railway remains unclear to outsiders. Yesterday, someone inquired about this matter to Mr. Lu Feibo Hong, Director of the Chinese Industrial United General Association. According to his account, the issue can be divided into two parts, which are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Cause of the Dispute</h3>
<p>There are two main points of contention between the Railway and the Mine. (1) The Beining Railway's regulations stipulate that ordinary merchants transporting goods must pay a penalty if they do not load all the goods within 24 hours after the Railway Bureau allocates a car. However, the freight contract between Kailuan and Beining does not explicitly stipulate this point. Since Kailuan uses as many as 600 cars, if empty cars are sent into the sidings for use, the cars that stay the longest will be the ones that entered the sidings first. However, the mine must first take the closest cars for use. It is difficult to drag out the cars that entered the sidings first. Therefore, the extension of the car usage period has always been based on the average time that all 600 cars spend in the sidings. The current authorities of the Beining Railway deny this method and demand that Kailuan pay over 1.2 million yuan in outstanding car extension fees over the years. Kailuan refuses to recognize this, which is the first point of contention. (2) Coal prices: In addition to the Beining Railway, the northern section of the Jinpu Railway also uses Kailuan coal. The price is stipulated in the contract to be the same as that of the Beining Railway. However, the Jinpu coal funds have accumulated arrears of more than 100,000 yuan for a long time without payment. Kailuan once used the method of refusing to supply coal as a countermeasure. Jinpu requested that Kailuan reduce the old debt appropriately, and all the arrears could be paid off. After Kailuan agreed to do so, the Beining Railway, upon hearing the news, requested that the price of the coal already paid by the Railway should also be reduced as an example. Kailuan believed that the arrangement for Jinpu was an unavoidable method to clear up old debts, and other buyers could not follow the example. The two sides have not yet resolved this issue, which is the second point of contention. However, in my opinion, the government should quickly mediate or arbitrate this matter, and resume coal transportation first. Otherwise, the import of Japanese coal will increase, and the value will increase again. The factories and residents who use coal will be directly harmed, and the livelihood of the laborers will be indirectly affected, and a lot of loopholes will be increased.</p>
<h3>Recovering Mining Rights</h3>
<p>The Coal Industry Association has suggested that the National Assembly recover the Kailuan Coal Mine, which is a legitimate approach. The Kailuan General Company was formed in the first year of the Republic of China by the merger of the Kaiping and Luanzhou companies. The treaty approved by the two central governments stipulates that after ten years, the Kailuan Mine Company can purchase all the assets of Kaiping at a very fair price. If our country recovers the British rights in accordance with the treaty, the British side will not be able to object. Regarding the redemption price, the Beijing-Tianjin Times once said that it would require 70 million yuan. Now that gold prices are high, it will not exceed 100 million yuan at most. This should be negotiated by the National Government and the British government, which has absolutely nothing to do with Kailuan's coal transportation. If the two sides hold on for a long time, Kailuan Mine will only suffer a temporary loss of sales, while our country will suffer a loss of road transportation and the people will suffer from expensive coal and coal shortages. It will only increase the sales and value of those who own mines such as Fushun, and they will sit back and reap the benefits.</p>
<h3>Dahua and Dachang Collision Case</h3>
<p>Proposed Arbitration Solution</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of responsibility for the collision between the Dahua and Dachang vessels, both sides have their own reasonable arguments. This case has now been submitted for arbitration, with both companies entrusting impartial arbitrators to carry out the arbitration. Yesterday, Dahua Company specifically replied to Ping An Company regarding the addition of arbitration personnel, expressing agreement. Their original letter is as follows: We have received your reply and are pleased to learn that you agree with our company's proposal for arbitration in the case of Dachang being sunk by Dahua. Regarding your inquiry about the number of arbitrators, if we hire only one person, there may be disputes over the selection of the person. It would be better for each party to hire one person, and then the two arbitrators would designate one person as the final judge. As for the scope of the arbitration, it seems appropriate for each party to state their own views. A draft arbitration agreement should be prepared, stating the number of arbitrators, the powers of the arbitrators, and which party bears the responsibility and compensation for all direct and indirect damages to the other party after the arbitration, so as to avoid temporary disputes after the arbitration and to prevent the case from being suspended without a decision. This draft agreement should be prepared within one week, and both parties should select a date and time and send a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Association, where the responsible personnel of both parties will exchange views on the draft agreement and formally sign it in person to ensure credibility. If there are disputes, the Association can be asked to mediate and reconcile, so that the arbitration will not be delayed and the whole case can be resolved as soon as possible. If you agree with our humble opinion, please give us a prompt reply so that we can follow your instructions. Sincerely, Ping An Shipping Company, May 7th.</p>

Yesterday, it issued instructions to its various departments and bureaus and announced the organizational rules of the Municipal Government. The instructions from the Municipal Government are recorded below: Shanghai Municipal Government Instruction No. 8181: In order to comply with the matter, the Municipal Organization Law has been promulgated by order. The Organizational Rules of this Government shall be revised in accordance with it. The draft proposal was previously prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Now, we have received instructions that it has been discussed, revised, and approved at the Nineteenth National Affairs Meeting and forwarded to the National Government for verification and approval. In addition to the announcement, all departments and bureaus are ordered to immediately comply with the laws and regulations to form an organization starting in the year 20 to comply with the laws and regulations and promote the progress of the city.</p>

<h3>Shanghai to Hold</h3>
<p>7th Annual Hygiene Promotion Week</p>
<p>Scheduled for One Week Starting the 15th</p>
<p>Large-Scale Promotion Next Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health will hold the Shanghai 7th Hygiene Promotion Week from the 15th to the 22nd of this month. The bureau has already printed a large number of hygiene slogans, which will be widely posted on major roads. Furthermore, they will be posted on rickshaws throughout the city for promotion. Since rickshaws travel more extensively within the city, residents are sure to see the slogans on the rickshaws and understand that most summer epidemics are caused by drinking raw water and eating unclean food, leading to various gastrointestinal diseases. To ensure these promotional materials and slogans catch the public's eye, and because May is often a turbulent month, the bureau will not hold parades. Additionally, the most rampant period for cholera outbreaks is during June and July. The National Health Administration, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health, and the health departments of the Public and French Concessions will jointly organize a large-scale hygiene campaign, expected to launch in early June. At that time, all Shanghai Boy Scouts will be instructed to participate in parades and promotions.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau</h3>
<p>Continues Convening Meeting to Promote the New Weights and Measures System</p>
<p>Afternoon of the 11th</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued Public Letter No. 9874 to various organizations, stating: "Regarding the promotion of the new weights and measures system in our city, our bureau has scheduled a second meeting for discussion on procedural matters at 3:00 PM on the 11th of this month, again at the Hua An Building, 8th floor. Our bureau chief will attend in person to receive your instruction. We are sending this letter in preparation, hoping you will review it and appoint a responsible representative to attend the meeting for deliberation."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Cables Request</h3>
<p>That the Railway Department Change the Beijing-Shanghai Line Schedule</p>
<p>To alleviate the hardship of travelers rushing late at night</p>
<p>Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Railway Department, stating: "To the Nanjing Railway Department: The recent changes to the Beijing-Shanghai line schedule have caused the No. 13 Shanghai-Beijing train, with 3rd and 4th class cars, to depart early at 5:30 AM. This was ostensibly for the convenience of passengers at Zhenjiang and Nanjing stations. However, considering the situation in Shanghai, the 4th class passengers are mostly laborers, and their workplaces are mostly in Yangshupu, Gaochangmiao, Caojiadu, and other places, which are quite far from the train station. It is difficult to arrive in time unless they get up very early in the night. Even a slight delay will mean missing the train, resulting in a futile journey. Those residing in Pudong who need to take the first ferry to Puxi to catch the train are even more inconvenienced. These passengers strongly feel that the departure time of the No. 13 train should be delayed. If it is difficult to change the schedule due to arranged train slots, adding 4th class cars to the No. 11 Shanghai-Beijing slow train, which departs at 10:00 AM and offers 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class, would alleviate the issue. Passengers further from the station would not have to rush, and the train would arrive in Danyang, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang in the afternoon after 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM, allowing passengers to return home without having to spend the night waiting for the dawn. We believe this is a better approach. We hereby present this situation via telegram and request your esteemed department to review and approve the alteration, as it would be greatly beneficial to the public. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Procedures Before the Opening of Business Tax Collection</h3>

<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of the various trade associations of this city yesterday received Approval No. 2661 from the Ministry of Finance regarding a request to reduce the business tax for ginseng, bird's nest, new medicines, and optometry to two per thousand. Having reviewed the submitted documents and examined the business tax collection regulations and implementation details of various provinces, the Ministry of Finance has already submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which then forwarded it to the Central Political Council to determine the principles, and subsequently sent it to the Legislative Yuan for review in accordance with the law. In accordance with the aforementioned, after the Executive Yuan's instructions are received by the Ministry, we will instruct you to comply and act accordingly. You are hereby notified of this approval.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>

<h3>Wang Yansong Telegrams Thanks to Representatives of Various Industries</h3>
<p>Wang Yansong, the representative of Shanghai's business community attending the National Conference, sent a telegram from Beijing yesterday to the representatives of various industries in this city, stating: "To the Chairman and Standing Committee members of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, and relayed to the representatives of various trade associations: Yansong is erroneously honored to be selected to attend the National Assembly. The responsibility is heavy, and I fear my abilities are insufficient. Before departing, I was moved by the representatives' visit to the station and their kind send-off. I am filled with shame for my inadequacy. I can only exhaust my limited abilities in hopes of fulfilling the entrusted task. I still ask for your guidance from time to time to avoid failure. I respectfully send this telegram of thanks, hoping for your consideration."</p>
<h3>Silk and Cocoon Association Submits Request to Zhejiang Provincial Government to Protect Cocoon Merchants</h3>
<p>The silkworm season in Zhejiang Province is the earliest. Jinhua, Lanxi, Yuyao, Linping, Chang'an, Haining, and other places are currently in the midst of the silkworms' great sleep and vigorous leaf consumption. New cocoons are expected to enter the market before the 20th of this month. Huang Jin, chairman of the Shanghai Jiangzhe Wan Silk and Cocoon Association, yesterday submitted a request to Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to instruct relevant departments to protect the cocoon market. The original submission stated: "Submitted to protect the cocoon market with early-stage preparations, with reference to the methods of previous years' submissions. We respectfully request your review and separate instructions to the military, political, and civil affairs officials in each cocoon-producing area to provide strict protection to ensure the safety of farmers and merchants. It is noted that Zhejiang Province's cocoon market is earlier, typically opening successively around the Xiaoman solar term. In past years, the association drafted protective measures, submitting them to the National Government, which distributed them to various provinces and regions, ordering them to provide protection, and printed the protection measures for your perusal, separately ordering all cocoon-producing areas to comply and implement them to ensure thorough protection. We are deeply grateful. With the cocoon market approaching this year, the social situation is still relatively peaceful. However, the areas slightly distant from the county are plagued by bandits and cannot relax their guard. Zhejiang's cocoon-producing areas have access to both water and land routes, and most cocoon businesses are located in rural towns. Farmers carrying cocoons to businesses and merchants carrying silver to collect cocoons must rely on strong protection along the routes they travel to ensure safety and avoid fear. The association's duty lies herein. We have carefully considered the past conditions regarding the various protective measures that should be implemented, such as the transportation of silver and the transport of cocoon packages, and have noted the dates in detail. We respectfully request that you preside over the handling of these matters and distribute them to the cocoon-producing counties before the deadline, instructing the stationed military and the county government's land and water public security bureaus to protect them in accordance with the regulations. In addition to submitting this to the National Government, we have also printed 100 copies of the method to be submitted</p>
<p>Germany Medical Doctor Bao Ge Fei Er Letter of Recommendation as Nicotine King</p>
<p>Former presidents Li Yuanhong, Xu Shichang, Cao Kun all had inscriptions and awards given</p>
<p>to your government for distribution to the military and civilian leaders in each district for investigation and handling. All prior submissions for early protection of the cocoon market are attached for your review and implementation, and we request your instructions to comply. We respectfully submit this to Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government."</p>
<h3>National Products Exhibition Hall Relocation</h3>
<p>The original site of the Shanghai National Products Exhibition Hall was at 149 South Railway Station Road. However, Shanghai is the commercial hub of the country and a gathering place for foreign goods. Therefore, for two years, the hall has spared no effort in promoting national products. As a result, its original location is now insufficient for its operations. It is now reported that the hall has been gradually relocating to 67 Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen, since May 1st, and its operations have been approved by the Municipal Social Bureau for slight expansion.</p>
<h3>French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association Convenes an Emergency Meeting Regarding the Xin Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the case where a Western police officer, No. 158, from the French Concession police force, shot Xin Haishan, an employee of Changhe Firm, without cause on Yong'an Street, the Seafood Trade Association, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, and the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce had previously sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, requesting them to intervene. After the Chinese director of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, Du Yuesheng, made representations to the French authorities, there has been no satisfactory response. The various organizations, feeling deeply resentful of the French side's deliberate delay, have repeatedly urged the French Concession Ratepayers Association to seriously intervene. Therefore, the association convened another emergency meeting on the evening of May 7th and resolved to request Chinese director Du Yuesheng to make earnest representations to the French authorities again to defend national rights and value people's lives. It is also reported that the Xin Case Support Association within the City Chamber of Commerce has also scheduled a second committee meeting for 2:00 PM on the 8th to discuss all ongoing matters to provide assistance in the intervention of the case.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Dispatches Personnel to Take Over the Fisheries Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Han Yougang Designated as the Bureau Director</p>
<p>Following the central government's order to exempt fish taxes and fisheries taxes, the Ministry of Finance's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Affairs Bureau was ordered at the end of April to conclude its operations. All fisheries administrative functions were also decided by the central government to be incorporated into the Ministry of Industry. It is now learned that the Ministry of Industry has dispatched Han Yougang, section chief of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Division, and technician Li Shixiang (Zi Dongxiang) to Shanghai to take over all public property and the Haiying and Fuhai patrol ships. The bureau's address at the Thierry Lane in Laoximen has been entirely leased by Zhou Jianyin, director of the Municipal Fisheries Guidance Center, for use as the center's office. It is also reported that the Ministry of Industry divides our country's fishing areas into four major regions: Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Fujian-Guangdong, Hebei-Shandong, Liaoning. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang region's fisheries are the most prosperous. At this time of the fishing season, coupled with the increasingly frequent intrusions by foreign patrol ships, it is imperative to establish a Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Management Bureau. Therefore, Han Yougang has been internally designated as the bureau director. As for the bureau's location, preliminary discussions have been held with Director Zhou of the Guidance Center to allocate a portion of the center as an office space.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Meeting Last Night</h3>
<p>Decides to Hire a Water Rate Research Specialist</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council's routine meeting was held yesterday afternoon because Wednesday is the Shanghai horse racing day. The meeting convened from 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM. The matters discussed included the decision to immediately hire a specialist to study the Shanghai water rate issue, with a reported fee of 6,000 yuan; the announcement of the immediate establishment of the Municipal Council's Press Committee; and the issue of land deeds.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Municipal Council Bonds</h3>
<p>Entrusted to HSBC Bank for Safekeeping</p>
<p>Contract Signed by Both Parties</p>
<p>Totaling Thirty-Nine Articles</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council announced yesterday that it has entrusted HSBC Bank with the safekeeping of bonds issued over the years, totaling 38,242,300 taels. The Municipal Council's assets and revenue are used as a secondary guarantee for these bonds to further ensure the protection of bondholders' interests. A safekeeping contract consisting of 39 articles was signed with HSBC Bank on the 16th of last month. The main points are as follows: (1) Briefly explaining the specialized terms in the contract. (2) The Municipal Council acknowledges a debt of 38,242,300 taels to the custodian, with the interest rate, semi-annual interest payment dates, and principal repayment dates all in accordance with the original provisions of the bonds listed in Schedule 1. (3) The custodian shall pay the principal and interest of the bonds in its custody in full in accordance with the original regulations of each bond. (4) The Municipal Council transfers the right to receive payments from the Shanghai Electric Power Company to the custodian. (5) The Municipal Council guarantees the bond payments with all of its current and future assets, including tax revenue. However, this is a floating guarantee and does not prevent the Municipal Council from selling, leasing, mortgaging its assets, or making other dispositions. However, the bond guarantee has priority. (6) There will be no changes to Clause A(1) of the payment provisions in the contract for the sale of the Electricity Department. (7) The payments specified in Clause A(2) of the contract for the sale of the Electricity Department shall continue to be paid by the Shanghai Electric Power Company to the Municipal Council as usual. However, if the custodian deems it necessary to protect the interests of the bondholders, it may, at any time and at its sole discretion, notify the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Municipal Council to have all or part of this payment made directly by the Shanghai Electric Power Company to the custodian. (8) The Municipal Council's existing debt repayment fund will be transferred to the custodian for safekeeping. (9) (10) (11) (12) The Municipal Council will continue to maintain a debt repayment fund account and its disposal methods. (13) After January 1, 1934, the Municipal Council may notify the custodian to redeem matured bonds with the debt repayment fund. (14) The Municipal Council will continue to use the real estate used as collateral, but in the event of the circumstances listed in Clause 15, the custodian may, at its discretion or at the written request of the bondholders, sell this property and retain the proceeds. However, the custodian may return it to the Municipal Council after both parties agree. (15) If the Municipal Council defaults on the payment of bond principal or interest, or transfers the collateral to another guarantee, causing this bond to lose its priority, or fails to comply with the provisions of this contract, the custodian may dispose of the collateral. (16) When disposing of the collateral, the custodian shall give prior written notice, but shall not dispose of it if the Municipal Council agrees to pay the overdue principal and interest or cancel the other guarantee within three months. The above are the main conditions of the entrustment. In addition, the contract stipulates the incidental rights enjoyed by the custodian, arbitration methods, and other necessary details. The final clause stipulates that any disputes shall be resolved in accordance with English law.</p>
<h3>Local Autonomy Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>Should Employ Specialized Talent</p>
<p>The Second District Party Headquarters' Submission</p>
<p>The Second District Party Headquarters of this city submitted a report to the Municipal Executive Committee, stating: "Regarding the municipal government's current appointment of local autonomy preparatory personnel, it is heard that many are local bullies, mediocre and corrupt individuals, incapable of bringing benefit. Please forward this to the municipal government, requesting the appointment of specialized talent. We believe that the importance of autonomy is known to all, and the difficulty of preparation is self-evident. The Prime Minister, in Article 8 of his hand-written Outline of National Construction (during the period of political tutelage, the government should send personnel who have been trained and qualified by examination to various counties to assist the people in preparing for autonomy...), the municipal government of this city, in upholding the Prime Minister's legacy and understanding the practical needs, has, despite financial constraints and countless matters awaiting attention, established a local autonomy training institute to train willing individuals and provide them with appropriate training for the primary goal of political tutelage and the grand foundation of autonomy. Over the months, the results have been remarkable, and examinations have already been conducted. It is a joy to see that the preparatory work for autonomy has found capable individuals. However, those reported as preparatory personnel in various districts the other day did not include anyone from the local autonomy training institute. Upon examining the preparatory personnel, it is found that there are local bullies and corrupt individuals among them. Their talent and learning may be inadequate, and their scandalous behavior has already been exposed. Who can believe that they are capable of preparing for autonomy and bringing benefit to the locality? Even if they are capable, how can we ensure that these bullies will not revert to their former demonic ways? Even with the municipal government's clear management and strict supervision, it will be difficult to prevent their hidden evils. Moreover, this is inconsistent with the Prime Minister's hand-written Outline of National Construction. Therefore, we are specifically submitting this to your council, requesting that you forward it to the municipal government to adhere to its original intention and long-held aspiration of employing well-trained talent to ensure that matters are successfully completed and that talents are not left unappreciated. The locality will be fortunate. It is heard that other district party headquarters have expressed similar sentiments."</p>
<h3>Native Cloth Industry</h3>
<p>Requests Expedited Tax Exemption for Exports</p>
<p>Since the goods of the local native cloth trade association destined for Andong, Yingkou, and other places in the Three Eastern Provinces were halted due to the imposition of tariffs, the association has repeatedly requested the Tariff Administration and Customs Administration to exempt them from export duties. Although oral permission has been obtained from both agencies, a formal announcement has yet to be made, causing the goods to pile up and posing a danger. The association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Customs Administration, and the Ministry of Finance's Tariff Administration yesterday to express its difficulties and request expedited release to alleviate the merchants' hardship. The original text is as follows: "Respectfully submitted, regarding the association's application for tax exemption on native cloth exports by the association's members, on April 16th, the association, together with the Cotton Cloth Guild, nominated Representative Ma to pay a visit, where the honorable director granted an audience and instructed the association. According to Representative Ma's report to the association, the director's intention was that handwoven native cloth has long been exempt from taxes, and it has now been determined that if taxes are levied elsewhere, no refunds will be given, so there should be no re-imposition of tariffs. This matter has been consulted with the Customs Administration, which has instructed the Tax Affairs Department to inform the customs, etc. Upon receiving this report, the association immediately notified its members to wait quietly. A decade has passed, and it is not appropriate to intrude arbitrarily on official procedures. However, the goods are stopped and滞留, those en route are stalled, those that have arrived cannot be unloaded, and the goods sent out are detained at the customs broker. Considering the risks of fire and water damage, there is too much danger. The goods destined for the Three Eastern Provinces are urgently requesting meetings to resolve the issue. Their plight is self-evident. We believe that the honorable director has deep insight and a clear understanding, and a definitive solution is within reach. However, the merchants face various dangers, and the summer season is approaching rapidly. If this is not resolved immediately, the magnitude of the losses would be unbearable. Therefore, we boldly submit this again, requesting the honorable director to consult with the Tax Affairs Department to approve the exemption from the date of transportation in order to avoid further damage. We are infinitely grateful."</p>
<h3>The Question of Whether the Money Shop Law is Necessary</h3>
<p>The Wuchen Society states that the financial community is paying close attention to the issue of the Money Shop Law. Recently, Gu Youqian, a reporter from the Money Shop Monthly, published an article elaborating on the importance of the Money Shop Law. We are now recording the article after reading Zhou Yangwen's "Is the Money Shop Law Necessary?", which discusses the operating methods of money shops and concludes that there is no need to enact a special law for money shops. While the enactment or non-enactment of the Money Shop Law is temporarily set aside, Zhou has many misconceptions about the actual operations of money shops. Therefore, this article is drafted to discuss these issues and is not intended to speak for the money shops. Zhou identifies three major operating methods of money shops: (1) the buying and selling of silver and the clearing of accounts for various customers; (2) credit lending; and (3) interbank silver transfers. The critique of the first category states that money shops consider silver to be profitable and therefore regard it as a major operation. It is not known that money shops do not regard the inflow and outflow of silver as important. If the country unifies the currency system and abolishes silver, silver will not be of great importance to money shops. When the Ministry of Finance held an economic conference the year before last, Committee Member Runqing of the Money Shop Association proposed a bill to abolish taels and change to yuan, which proves my point is not mistaken. Zhou's speculation is refuted without attack. As for the clearing of accounts, the amount is very small and can only be considered a handling fee. Banks also have different entry and exit prices for buying and selling drafts at the same time and place, so to say that this is enough to harm merchants is an excessive statement. The critique of the second category has the following five points: (1) credit lending cannot meet the needs of the entire society; (2) credit lending is highly risky and affects deposits; (3) to avoid abuses in management and operation, organizational reform must be carried out first; (4) credit lending is insubstantial and unstable and is not as substantial as mortgage lending; (5) the cessation of credit lending will make it difficult for industry and commerce to survive, and workers will also be affected, inevitably hoping for financial cooperation. Banks should come forward to cooperate with industry and commerce. Now, looking at the first point, the financial industry must meet the needs of the entire society, and credit deposits did have this function in the past. Although mortgage lending exists today, it accounts for only a small number of commercial transactions, and lending for silkworm and rice harvests cannot be done without collateral first. Therefore, credit lending still accounts for the majority of society. Legislators are working for the benefit of the people, so how can they abandon the majority and settle for the minority? Even if credit lending cannot meet the needs of the entire society, can mortgage lending meet the needs of the entire society today? The second point is related to the organization of the money shop industry. Because the money shop industry is operated as a partnership or sole proprietorship, the shareholders bear unlimited liability. Therefore, the regulations of the industry stipulate that if a money shop stops or runs aground, the shareholders must first repay the deposits. This has always been the case, and there have been few exceptions. Furthermore, at the beginning of the organization of a money shop, a strict review by the industry is required before allowing people to join. Therefore, even if there are unexpected circumstances in lending, it will not harm the interests of depositors, let alone affect social finance. The third point, the term "organization," based on its meaning, refers to companies and partnerships. According to the partnership organization, shareholders must bear unlimited liability. Therefore, they regard business as their own life and are unwilling to be perfunctory. Its spirit is actually above the company organization, and the organization of shops is not limited to companies. If the financial industry is limited to company organizations, it will also lose the fairness of things. The fourth point states that credit lending is not as substantial as mortgage lending. Of course, those who have nothing to mortgage will never be able to develop their careers in the industry and commerce world. Under the Kuomintang's control of capital, it seems impossible to only think from the perspective of those with capital and suppress the lives of small and medium-sized businessmen. This is one reason. Credit is one of the virtues, and to focus solely on wealth and despise morality seems to be a loss of the balance of life. This is the second reason. The fifth point acknowledges the harm of stopping or reducing credit lending. However, in this time of industrial decline and high unemployment, the hidden dangers in society can be triggered with a single touch. Why not seek stability and remedies, and instead add fuel to the fire to promote its eruption, making it difficult for the entire country's industry and commerce to survive? The result is only to enable banks to cooperate with industry and commerce. I am afraid that before the banks gain power, they will demand the people in a dried fish shop. The third category discusses the interbank transfer of silver, which is related to the first category and is not the author's important point, so it is not repeated. In summary, money shops take credit lending as their main business, compared with banks' mortgage lending, the banks are wise and the money shops are foolish. But fortunately, our country's industry and commerce rely on this willing-to-sacrifice money shop to be able to transfer, which seems to be of slight benefit to society.</p>
<h3>Shipments to Guangdong Plummet</h3>
<p>Most of the goods shipped to Guangdong from Shanghai are yarn, cloth, and miscellaneous foreign goods. Shipments are currently extremely crowded. However, the Guangdong Customs Department suddenly issued new regulations requiring all goods shipped to Guangdong from various ports to pay import duties regardless of whether they have already paid import duties. Even goods that have already paid import duties at the Shanghai Jianghai Customs Department must be paid again as usual, otherwise they will not be allowed to be unloaded. This new measure only came into effect this month. Guangdong merchants have to pay double taxes on a single shipment, increasing their business costs and making it more difficult to make a profit. Therefore, they have telegraphed Shanghai to temporarily delay the loading of goods that have already been processed to avoid unexpected losses. As a result, the number of goods transported to Guangdong by various companies and Nanhua Lines in Shanghai has been decreasing daily.</p>
<h3>The First Ship from Shanghai to Huludao</h3>
<p>German Ship Saisibao</p>
<p>Since the Liaoning authorities began developing Huludao last year, Shanghai has had no commercial ships due to the unfinished project. The German merchant Henbao Company's ship Saisibao has been transporting a large number of kerosene and other goods to the port for unloading. This is the first ship from Shanghai to the new port of Huludao. The ship was blocked due to draught issue upon reaching Huludao. A telegram was received yesterday saying that the ship had safely entered the port and was unloading cargo.</p>
<h3>Fengpu Set to Rescue Minghe from Vladivostok Today</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Minghe ship ran aground near the Peacock Port north of Vladivostok. The Shanghai Bureau dispatched the Fengpu to rescue it, as repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the company received another telegram from the crew of the Minghe, stating that the Minghe was aground among the Chai Panoffer reefs. Because the spring tide has not yet risen, the bottom of the ship is propped up on the reef. The boilers and engines inside the ship have been repaired, but the water on the reef is shallow, and the ship cannot sail out. It will not be able to leave the reef until the high tide. The Sanbei Company selected more than 20 technicians at its factory yesterday, who are scheduled to go to Vladivostok on the Fengpu ship today. However, after inspecting the bottom of the ship, they decided to first go to Japan to hire a number of divers and then go to the site to unload the accumulated cargo from the Minghe to raise the ship and then wait for the tide to tow it out of danger.</p>

<h3>Trade Union News</h3>
<p>The Postal Workers' Union held its 23rd Executive Committee meeting the day before yesterday. Chairman Liu Xinquan gave a formal address and reported on matters (abbreviated). Matters discussed included: (1) It was resolved that the union dues will still be calculated and collected at 1% of the actual salary. The secretariat was instructed to notify the members. (2) It was resolved that the union should jointly issue a declaration with other unions and designate comrades Lu Jingshi and Xing Rongzhao to be responsible for drafting the declaration regarding how the union should express itself on the selection of labor representatives for this year's International Labor Conference, which is designated by the central government. (3) It was resolved to send a letter to the Postal Administration stating that it has been suggested to the bureau management director that whenever senior staff take leave, lower-level staff are often assigned to act as agents, which affects postal efficiency and staff treatment. The letter should request that the authorities assign staff of the same rank to act as agents when a certain level of staff takes leave in the future. (4) It was resolved that it should be suggested that the authorities negotiate with the Public Security Bureau to stop this search, as postal carriers are searched by the Public Security Bureau while on duty, which not only affects their duties but also the dignity of the post office. The Secretariat was instructed to prepare a letter to the Postal Administration to suggest this. (5) It was resolved that the issue of the 10-yuan allowance for new postal workers has been repeatedly submitted by the union to the General Office but has not yet been approved for allocation, and that additional cadres should be sent to actively negotiate with the authorities. It was decided to designate Lu Jingshi, Qi Jiamou, Xing Rongzhao, Zhang Kechang, and Zhao Shusheng to actively negotiate with the negotiation department. (6) It was resolved that it should be investigated and handled in conjunction with the previous case regarding reports that the Special Funds Section of the Finance Department of the General Office and all pension funds will be transferred to the Savings and Remittance Bureau, which violates the pension and welfare fund management regulations. (7) It was resolved (A) that the secretariat should notify members to refuse to participate in this exam; (B) that it should be actively negotiated in conjunction with case (6) regarding that the Bureau will hold a proficiency test for postal workers of the third to sixth grades or above on May 10, and union members should refuse to participate and actively negotiate with the authorities. (8) It was resolved that when official duties are busy and working hours are extended, the meal expenses originally issued by the authorities to staff of all levels are really meager given the high cost of living at this time, and that the authorities should uniformly increase the allowance by one jiao. (9) It was resolved that the Investigation Department should investigate and handle the matter regarding that the method of promoting to formal coolies after three months of service by the extra coolies in the export room of the bureau is unfair because those who have served longer are not promoted. (10) It was resolved to present a souvenir with expenses not exceeding 10 yuan as Supervisory Committee member Meng Shuxiu will be transferred to the mainland for service. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Gongfa Company</h3>
<p>Method of Property Disposal</p>
<p>Four items have been agreed upon by accountants, etc.</p>
<p>The French Public Concession has approved it yesterday.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Da Shijie Amusement Savings Department bankruptcy case was heard again in the French Court yesterday. First, accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang reported that they had been ordered by the court to actively proceed with the liquidation in order to collect the debts as soon as possible so that they could be distributed. Therefore, they drafted a method for disposing of Gongfa Company's assets and sent a letter to the attorneys of various creditors and the attorney of Huang Chujiu's family on April 29th. They convened a meeting at Zhizu Lu 250, Aiduya Road on the 3rd of this month to discuss the method of disposing of Gongfa Company's assets. After three hours, the following matters were all passed: (1) The Chinese and Western Pharmacy will still be transferred to Zhou Bangjun, the original manager of the pharmacy, at a negotiated price of 240,000 yuan in national currency and will not be advertised separately. However, the method of payment will be negotiated separately by our accountants and Zhou Bangjun. It will take about eight months to pay the money. (2) The hot spring bath will be advertised with a negotiated price standard of 50,000 yuan in national currency. (3) The Fuchang Tobacco Company will use the method proposed by the accountants with a negotiated price standard of 520,000 yuan in national currency. However, in addition to the Day and Night Bank and the Huizhong Bank, the assignee will inherit and bear all debts owed by the company, which will offset the negotiated price of 400,000 yuan in national currency. The accountants will first contact Yao Ji, the original assistant manager of the company, and Zhang Shankun, the director of the business department, and follow the procedure of soliciting bids for the Chinese and Western Pharmacy. (4) Regarding the solicitation of bids for Da Shijie, the accountants will study whether it is more beneficial to pay the negotiated price in one lump sum or in installments, and then convene a meeting after making a separate plan. The accountants also reported on the progress of handling this case and the method of disposing of Huang Chujiu's estate by Tan Yigong, the attorney of Huang Chujiu's family, at the meeting on the same day, requesting approval to proceed. Then, Bian Jialu, the attorney for the plaintiff, said that according to the accountant's report, the negotiated price of the Chinese and Western Pharmacy can only be paid in about eight months, but the creditors are very anxious to receive the money. He requested that the court order the accountant to instruct Zhou Bangjun to pay the money as soon as possible for distribution. Then, Yan Luqing, the attorney for the plaintiff, said that our attorney has an important request that has attracted much attention in society but has not been mentioned in this case, that is, all of Huang Chujiu's jewelry. Huang Chujiu is a parvenu and not from an old wealthy family, so there are not many pearls but many diamonds. Shanghai has always been famous for this. Now, after checking Huang's list of movable properties, there are only three diamonds, which is very suspicious. These three pieces are also marked as pledged. However, Huang's diamonds have attracted much attention in society and are related to the interests of creditors. He requested that the court subpoena Huang's family and the pledgee to investigate. In addition, a piece of raw jade stone weighing 327 jin is worth about 100,000 yuan. It is currently stored at Liu Baogeng's place and should be supervised by the liquidator to show seriousness. Then, Tan Yigong, the attorney for Huang's family, reported on the situation of Huang's property. Judge Gong Cheng approved the handling of the case according to the accountant's report and adjourned the hearing for further verification.</p>
<h3>Paint Turns into Yellow Mud</h3>
<p>Theft Discovered on a Lighter</p>
<p>Seven Thieves Arrested</p>
<p>Shihe Foreign Company on Beijing Road once sent a lighter loaded with 28 barrels of red paint worth 8,533.20 yuan to a ship for export. Unexpectedly, when checking at the receiving point, all of them were found to be yellow mud that had been sold. The boatmen had fled to Chongming and other places. After learning of this, the foreign company reported to the water patrol police station and ordered the police to investigate. Later, it was found that Zhou Wan'an (aka Wild Tiger), Gu Dalang, Gu Linjiang, Gong Zhaoming, and other well-known leaders of thieves in Shanghai Port had colluded with the boatmen to commit theft more than once, often blaming it on the misconduct on the ship. Therefore, Yuan Jiangfu, Guo Chulang, Gong Huilin, Zhou Dagou, Fan Qilang, Zhou Genqing, Yang Furong, and other seven people were arrested. The rest have fled. In addition to offering rewards for the arrest of those who escaped, the arrested criminals have confessed to colluding in theft without denying it. Yesterday, they were transferred to the local court for trial.</p>
<h3>Robbers Meet to Plan Robbery</h3>
<p>The Plan is Discovered by Police Due to Lack of Secrecy</p>
<p>Many Male and Female Thieves Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>The police in Hongkou learned that thieves were meeting in Room 9 of the Haitongchun Hotel on Yunnan Road yesterday to plan a robbery. Detectives He Xiaozhi and West Inspector Hale, along with detectives Liu Zhaonian and Zhang Yousheng, rushed to arrest them. Zhang Afu, Wu Kunsheng, and Wang Genlin from Pudong, and Jiang Youcai from Tongzhou were arrested. A group of detectives were stationed in the room to catch all the accomplices who came. Soon, Yang Qichun and Zhang Fugeng, local people, and Zhou Shaoshi, a woman from Suzhou, were also arrested. After questioning them one by one, they went to Room 125, Asia Hotel, Hankou Road, and arrested Shao Qiusheng from Pudong and Ma Donghai from Chongming. Then, they went to a house at 105 and a half Ximolu to search for weapons. They found three pistols, 98 bullets, and one Mauser pistol. Zhang Zilin from Haimen, Li Linsheng from Pudong, and Zhang Wushi, a woman from Chongming, who lived in the house, were brought to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation by Judge Xiao. Ma Donghai admitted that he was invited by Wang Asan, who is at large, to the Asia Hotel to discuss robbing a resident on the north bank of the old garbage bridge the next morning. Zhang Zilin confessed that the guns and ammunition in his house were brought and deposited by Ma Donghai and Wang Asan for use in robbing residents on the north bank of the old garbage bridge. The pawn tickets were jointly owned by Ma, Wang, and himself, but the pawned items were not stolen goods. The other men denied being robbers, and Zhang Wushi confessed that she had been living with Zhang Zilin for only a few months. Zhou Shaoshi confessed that she was a maid at the Yaofeng brothel on Zilaishui Street and was looking for Miss Lao Liu at Haitongchun. However, according to the reports of Chinese and Western detectives, the woman usually carried guns for thieves. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested a postponement for investigation. The court ordered all defendants to be returned to custody pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Case of Strangled Woman</h3>
<p>The Inside Story is Still Unclear</p>
<p>Chen Quanlong Consistently Denies Murder</p>
<p>No Relatives of the Deceased Have Come to Claim the Body</p>
<p>A female guest was strangled to death at the Sanjiang Hotel on Beihai Road on the night of the 22nd of last month. The male companion who stayed with her took the opportunity to escape, so no one knew the identity of the deceased at the time, which became a mystery. On the 29th of last month, Chen Quanlong from Songjiang surrendered to the police station, claiming to be the lover of the deceased. The deceased was his concubine, named Zong Azhen, 29 years old, originally from Fengjing. However, when they checked into the hotel, he used the alias Wang Desheng, and the woman also used the alias Zhang. The police chief then transferred Chen to the Special District Local Court and ordered him to be detained pending interrogation. This has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Chief Judge Zhou Han opened the court for a continued hearing, but no relatives of the deceased were present. Only Yu Kunrong, the waiter of the Sanjiang Hotel, and Ding Yuanhong, the gateman, were summoned as witnesses by the police. Yu testified that it was his turn to work that night. At 2:30 a.m., the defendant returned from outside and opened the door. He still saw the young woman sitting up in bed. Then, he prepared tea and closed the door of the room and left. He did not know about the subsequent changes. Ding Yuanhong testified that the hotel's rules were to close the doors at 3:00 a.m. and that no one entered or left after 3:00 a.m. that night. Chen Quanlong confessed that in the afternoon of the 22nd of last month, he and Zong Azhen went to the Sanjiang to open a room and then went to the New New Company to play. After playing at 11:00 p.m., they returned together. Azhen went to sleep first. He waited for her to fall asleep and then went out alone to visit a friend in Baoyu Lane in the French Concession. When he returned to the hotel at 2:30 a.m., he suddenly saw that Azhen was already dead on the floor of the room. He originally planned to report to the police station immediately, but because his family did not know about it, he was afraid of being detained, so his family suspected him. He hugged the body and placed it on the bed and then left the hotel and rushed back to Songjiang. He told his family about this and then came to Shanghai and surrendered to the police station, requesting a thorough investigation to find out who killed Azhen and to clear his name and redress his grievances. Chief Judge Zhou said that since the defendant completely denied the murder, it was necessary to continue the investigation to determine whether he was trying to deceive or whether there were other circumstances. He ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for further investigation.</p>

<h3>China International Trade Association</h3>
<p>New Office on the Fourth Floor of Customs</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the International Trade Association has spared no effort in developing its affairs. In addition to soliciting members, it has also been planning in detail the methods of promoting export trade and the steps of introducing direct trade to ensure that all members and industries related to international trade benefit. Therefore, the association's work focuses on practically assisting the development of international trade and does not fall into the trap of superficiality and emptiness. The association's address was originally located in the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, but now, due to the development of affairs, the house is not enough for application, and it has found another address on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs on Hankou Road as the association's address, and it has moved into the office the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Takes Over Slaughter Tax and Slaughter Inspection Fee</h3>
<p>Slaughter tax collected according to old regulations</p>
<p>Inspection fees have been reduced separately</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters from various newspapers went to the Municipal Finance Bureau to inquire about the takeover of the slaughter tax and cattle and sheep inspection fees. The person in charge of the bureau made the following statement: (1) The slaughter tax in the Shanghai urban area refers to the special education funding that has been used to solicit merchants to pay for it through the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office. Now that the contract period is over, another method should be determined. Therefore, it has been discussed with the management office to hand over the slaughter tax to the bureau for takeover and collection on May 1. The tax rate will still be handled according to the old regulations and has not increased. Donating households will not suffer any losses. The collection of all taxes should be based on the principle of direct collection as the only principle of improving taxes and is more convenient in terms of management and taxpayers. (2) The urban slaughter inspection fee is purely a handling fee and is different in nature from taxes. The cattle and sheep inspection fee in the 19th year was contracted and paid by the Cattle and Sheep Industry Association. It is heard that the overcollected fees were very large. It is heard that cattle and sheep merchants have always complied with the regulations to pay. The Cattle and Sheep Association should be responsible for paying the aforementioned overcollected fees. Now, in order to facilitate consolidation, the bureau has presented it to the municipal government for approval in conjunction with the Health Bureau and will take back the cattle and sheep inspection fee and handle it by itself on May 1. The originally determined fee amount will be reduced separately according to the size of the cattle and the type of sheep to show consideration.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the bureau is also afraid that those with small businesses will have difficulty purchasing the slaughter inspection fee certificates and slaughter tax bills, which are all bound into books of 50 each, so it has ordered various tax collection offices to immediately change to retail sales methods to facilitate them.</p>
<h3>Baoming Electric Company Sends Japanese Electricity in Installments</h3>
<p>Baoming Electric Company of Wusong complies with the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's unified power plant plan to purchase electricity from Zhabei Water and Electricity Company for resale. It has been implemented since May 1. It has been reported in previous newspapers that Baoming Company plans to start sending Japanese electricity for the convenience of users. However, the area is vast. For the sake of caution, it plans to proceed in stages. First, it will supply Japanese electricity to the Jungong Road area starting on May 5. If there are no obstacles, it will then supply the Wusong Town area starting on May 16, and the Paotaiwan area starting on June 1. It is heard that it has been reported to the Public Utilities Bureau for record.</p>
<h3>Great Union of Chinese Insurance Industry</h3>
<p>Nine Companies Establish Reinsurance Group</p>
<p>Riri News Yunhua Chinese Tongyi Insurance Company and others are seeking to unite and recover rights and interests to implement the organization of a reinsurance group to accept the business of large insurance, and the members of the reinsurance group reinsure each other and share responsibility. This organization was officially established on the 1st of this month. The members are Tongyi Insurance Department, China An Water and Fire Insurance Company, China Xing Water and Fire Insurance Company, Ningshao Insurance Department, Central Insurance Department, Zhaotai Water and Fire Insurance Company, Anping Water and Fire Insurance Company, Dahua Water and Fire Insurance Company, and Fengsheng Water and Fire Insurance Company. Zhu Shuyi of Tongyi Insurance Department is the director. Since its establishment, Dahua Company has accepted the insurance of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation for 500,000 yuan for the first time, and Tongyi and Dahua have jointly accepted 25% of the insurance of the National Branch of the Commercial Press for 2.19 million yuan for the second time. In total, more than 1 million yuan has been insured within a week. Previously, Chinese insurance companies were limited by capital and could not accept large amounts of insurance. Now, among the nine members of this reinsurance group, no matter how much insurance is received, it can be reinsured by the members. When the capital amount of the members has been insured and satisfied, it can be given to other Chinese insurance companies for mutual reinsurance. Therefore, the rights and interests of large amounts of insurance in our country will not be lost to foreign insurance companies in the future.</p>
<h3>Guohua Bank Adds Telephone Remittance Along the Beijing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>Guohua Bank is seeking convenient methods for customers.

<h3>Christian Elders' Fellowship</h3>
<p>Christian literary figures Chen Chunsheng and Zhao Ximin initiated an elders' fellowship. It was held at 11:00 AM on the Double Fifth Festival (the 5th) at Willow Shade Villa in Hongkou.

<h3>Record of the Meeting of the Fresh Meat Trade Association</h3>
<p>The entire urban and rural meat industry of Shanghai held a meeting at the Fresh Meat Trade Association in Zhizhong Lane, French Concession, on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. Representatives were present from Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, Xujiahui, Longhua, Jiangqiao, Fahua, Caojiadu, Beixinjing, Lannidu, Yangsi Bridge, Sanlintang, Tangqiao, Yangjiadu, Yangjing, Gaoqiao, Zhabei, and other places. Representatives from the Cattle and Sheep Trade Association were also present, totaling over 400 people. On the spot, it was resolved that the Municipal Finance Bureau, having already levied a slaughter tax, was now also levying an inspection tax, with doctors' fees added when returning to the countryside. Such overlapping levies greatly violated the principle of one tax per item. Furthermore, the municipal business tax was about to be implemented. After joint discussion, it was unanimously resolved to acknowledge the business tax while striving to abolish the slaughter tax in order to alleviate the pain of the industry. Subsequently, a joint meeting of the three industries—cattle, sheep, and pork—formed an organizing committee to discuss the aftermath. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

The store owner, Fu Shengrong, initially did not know who the thief was until the end of the year when the store apprentice Wang Zhengfa, from Ningbo, left without notice. He suspected that Wang was the thief and reported the theft to the Hongkou Police Station, requesting an investigation, but Wang's whereabouts were unknown and he had not been apprehended. The day before yesterday, early in the morning, Wang Zhengfa suddenly surrendered himself to the police station and confessed to stealing foreign liquor. He said that his fellow townsman, Gu Fusheng, and Tongzhou native, Peng Jinhai, were both addicted to gambling and prostitution, and especially liked watching movies, but had no money. Therefore, they stole foreign liquor at night, loaded it onto a car, and sold it in various places, dividing the money. The operation had been going on for a year without being detected. He also revealed the whereabouts of Gu and Peng. The police head dispatched detectives to arrest the two. Yesterday, they were handed over to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng interrogated them and ordered them to be detained pending further questioning.</p>

<h3>A Petty Quarrel Between a Young Couple Leads to Death</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiangshi Hangs Herself</p>
<p>Zhu Yunzhou, 66 years old, resides at No. 7 Pailou Lane outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi with his wife, Mrs. Wei, 55 years old, and their son, Hao Fu, 24 years old. Hao Fu married Jiang Jinshou’s daughter from Tongzhou, who ran a carpentry business at No. 278 Dongjiadu Street nearby, through a matchmaker in 1928. After the marriage, the couple’s relationship was considered quite harmonious. Mrs. Jiang is now 20 years old and has a three-year-old son, and she is eight months pregnant. Her husband, Hao Fu, works at the Asia Petroleum Company. He usually wakes up at around 7 AM every morning to prepare for work at the company. The day before yesterday morning, after waking him up as usual, they suddenly had a petty argument, which escalated into a major conflict. Zhu, who works at the Zhang Xiangfeng Candy Store, immediately rushed home with his wife, Mrs. Wei, upon hearing the news of the dispute between his son and daughter-in-law, and tried to mediate. After Hao Fu left for work, Mrs. Jiang angrily went upstairs. Her three-year-old son was taken by Mrs. Wei to play in front of the door. Around 9 AM, the child wanted to find his mother. Mrs. Wei then went upstairs, calling out to her daughter-in-law, but received no response. Knowing that something was wrong, she hurriedly entered the room and saw Mrs. Jiang kneeling on the bed, hanging herself from the ceiling beam with a white silk trouser belt. Mrs. Wei was shocked. In an instant, she gathered the family and cut the rope, but Mrs. Jiang was already cold and beyond help. Shortly after, Cui Xuming, the guard on duty at the third checkpoint, heard the news and rushed over. He took Zhu and Jiang Jinshou to the local First District, First Precinct, where the chief, after a preliminary hearing, instructed the local head, Qin Defang, to report the matter to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy. Inspector Zhao, accompanied by the coroner, arrived at the scene and determined that the deceased, Zhu Jiangshi, had indeed hanged herself. He immediately filled out the form and ordered the body to be coffined and buried as soon as possible, and obtained a written guarantee for safekeeping.</p>

<p>To the Editor, Upon reading the section (Industrial Survey Started Yesterday) in the local news column of your newspaper, I noticed the phrase "Statistics Bureau of the Legislative Yuan's Accounting Office." Please note that the Statistics Bureau of the Accounting Office is directly under the National Government, not affiliated with the Legislative Yuan. For this survey, each agency sent two people and was not commissioned by the Research Institute of Jiaotong University. I am writing to request that you correct this. Sincerely, Shanghai Industrial Survey Joint Office, May 7, 20th year.</p>
<p>To the Editor, Having seen in the "New Construction in the Aviation Sector" section of today's local news column that the Aviation Association has reorganized according to orders, it is stated that "(After receiving this order yesterday, the Shanghai Aviation Association immediately disbanded its original association and changed it to a preparatory office)" and "(A preparatory office will be set up on the third floor of No. 10 Guangdong Road)." The statements regarding disbandment, change to a preparatory office, and the initial establishment of a preparatory office are all untrue. Please correct these to clarify the facts and maintain public trust. Sincerely, Shanghai Shipping Association, 2057.</p>

<h3>Northern Travels Sketches</h3>
<p>— Anping</p>
<p>13. Northern Newspapers and Supplements</p>
<p>There are many newspapers in the North. Combining Beijing and Tianjin, there are probably close to ten. The more readable ones are the Dagong Bao in Tianjin, followed by the Chen Bao in Beijing, and then the Yong Bao in Tianjin. There are many others, such as the Huabei Ribao, the Jing Bao, and the Shijie Ribao… Unfortunately, I cannot remember them all.</p>
<p>I must honestly say that although the scale of the newspapers in Beijing is far from as large as those in Shanghai, the news industry in the North is more vibrant than in the South. The biggest reason for this is that the newspapers in the South are only a kind of Building Affair, while those in the North have more of a Literary flavor. This is probably partly due to the environment and partly due to the interests of the newspaper operators. In the past, there were many small publications and magazines in Beijing, but now they are simply declining. Relatively better ones, such as the (Camel Grass) run by Xu Zuzheng and others, have also reached the end of their life. To talk about the literary scene in the North, there is really nothing to say because it is fundamentally in decline. In this pitiful atmosphere, the supplements in the newspapers are relatively more lively. Speaking of supplements, the quantity of supplements in the newspapers in the North is far different from that in the newspapers in Shanghai. For example, the Shishi Xinbao in Shanghai used to have a supplement almost every day, and the Minguo Ribao also had one almost every day. Later, because the paper was too expensive, they were all canceled. However, the newspapers in the North have many supplements. The Tianjin Yongbao does not have many supplements, while the Dagong Bao and the Chen Bao in Beijing have many supplements (recently, the Chen Bao also published the Northern Chen Pictorial and the Northern Chen Review every Monday, one sheet each). In terms of quality, the several supplements of the Chen Bao and the Dagong Bao are not considered to be too bad. On the one hand, the writers are relatively reputable and knowledgeable, and the manuscripts are also selected very strictly. As for the supplements of the other newspapers, the quality is really pitifully bad, and the printing is also extremely bad. The supplement of the Huabei Ribao occasionally has manuscripts from He Xi, Qu Yongkun, and others, and the color is relatively clear, but generally, the quality is still not high. The reason for this is that some of the smaller newspapers do not have enough news, so they attach one or two supplements to make up the number of pages. Naturally, these kinds of supplements will not be good. In fact, the manuscripts published in several of the supplements in Beijing are not only not brilliant, but can simply be said to be terribly bad. One feature of the supplements of the newspapers in Beijing is that most of them have readings for children. The Dagong Bao has them, the Chen Bao has them, and some others also have them, and they are not weekly publications, but simply have them every day. The second feature is the large number of drama publications. In Beijing, there are Xiong Foxi, Yu Shangyuan, Zhao Taimou, and others who run drama. On the one hand, they publish their own magazines, and on the other hand, they also publish supplements in the newspapers. They are indeed very active. Ding</p>
<p>In summary, there are many newspapers in the North, but few are readable. There are also many supplements in the newspapers in the North, but few are readable.</p>
<h3>Dissection of Doubt</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>"Bing decided to go to Hangzhou tomorrow. He said he would ask his lover, Hong, to go with him. He asked her to go to Yi Town with him last time, but it didn't work out. This time, it will be possible." Xu said to me at dinner. So we talked about Bing and Hong again until they came back.</p>
<p>In the hazy morning mist, when the sun was still too lazy to come out, Bing and Hong had already gotten up. By the time we got up, they had already taken the boat and left for their lovely environment, the realization of their ideals. From today onwards, Bing's ideal and Hong's imagination are proven in our eyes.</p>
<p>My friends, haven't you had a lot of doubts about me recently? Haven't you been distrustful of me? My friends, haven't you heard a lot of bad things about me recently? Haven't you heard a lot of lies about me? From today onwards, I can defend myself in front of you, and even if I don't defend myself, you should understand. My friends, you can probably understand everything about me now.</p>
<p>I know that your doubts and distrust of me are instigated by Bing. I also know that the bad things and lies about me are fabricated by Bing. I know that the truth will eventually clear my name, so I didn't pay attention to it or resist it because sooner or later our days will prove everything.</p>
<p>I don't blame Bing, and I don't hate Bing. Because Bing wants to prove himself in front of everyone. In order to be loyal to himself, and in order to be closer to Hong without being talked about by others, he has to do this. But if he turns around and thinks about it carefully, he should know that he is too unfair to me.</p>
<p>When Bing first loved Hong, Hong and I were still friends. Hong was really good to me. But because of this, Bing became a little unnatural towards me. So he always complained in front of me. In front of you, he always said bad things about me, saying that I had a relationship with Hong. On the one hand, he exonerated himself. On the other hand, he made you doubt me and guard against me. So we all fell into his trap. Until Xu announced what Bing said yesterday and that Bing and Hong went to Hangzhou together today, we just realized how wrong everything was before, how much we were fooled. My friends, you absolutely understand everything about me now.</p>
<p>Bing is indeed a resourceful young man. He not only did this to you before but also ruined our relationship in front of my friend Yan. Fortunately, the weeds on the side of the road still don't attract much love. The fact is that three months ago, I didn't write a letter to Yan. The letter said:</p>
<p>"... The facts are very clear, but I can't stay by their side for long. I hope you eliminate him. In order to prevent your young sprouts from growing, I desperately guarded them before, but I can't guard them forever..."</p>
<p>My friends, was his approach to Hong originally to prevent me? My friends, have you received the same letter? But I know that from today onwards, you should understand everything.</p>
