<h3>國聨陷於僵局</h3>
<p>有召集特别會議之擬議電請中日注意非戰公約</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　目下國聨對於滿案之發展狀况、撮述於下、（一）現理事會尋覓解决方法、婙入僵局、（二）召集評議特别會議之提議、討論頗見順利、（三）日本聲明非俟與中國直接談判商得恊定後不撤兵、（四）各理事决定分函中日提醒凱洛格非戰公約之義務、（五）日本繼續反對美國參加理事會、（六）美政府訓令美代表勿加入討論對於中國或日本之經濟抵制（七）美報界論調對於參加理事會贊否不一、（八）有施行制裁或經濟抵制之提議、（九）國聨欲喚起世界輿論及道德力量、壓迫中日政府、（十七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　頃從極可靠方面探悉、理事會在本日秘密會議中、對於召集評議會特别會議一節、討論頗見順利、倘目下僵局不能打開、則此事將見實行、評議大會之任務、大約在討論究用制裁抑經濟抵制、以解决中日危局、更或將滿洲事件之整個問題提出評議會、以喚起世界輿論、亦未可知、但如目前所討論之經　抵制計劃、尤其在英美之合作、衆必認爲亦不能行、至召集評議特别會議、在九二六年討論德國加入聨盟案時、已有先例、聞今夕各理事秘密會中、已論及總秘書立即召集評議特别會議之手續問題、</p>
<p>又電、今夕各理事續開秘密會議後、對於解决滿案仍毫無辦法、明日將續行會商、今日與會各理事　美代表在内、議定再分函中日兩國政府提醒對於凱洛格非戰公約所負之義務、尤其對於第二條規定、定用公斷爲解决國際爭執方法之義務、據可靠消息、今夜秘密會議六時開殆、討論事項仍如晨間會議、先討論喚起全世界輿論與道德力量、壓迫中日政府之方法、次乃根據凱洛格公約有無繼續行動之可能性、至七時半散會、晨夕兩次會議、美代表俱列席、惟中日代表均未往、當今夕秘密會議之前、白里安曾訪日代表芳澤談話甚夕、但因日本仍堅持反對美國參加、反對撤兵及主張直接談判之故、無甚結果、又今日芳澤照會理事會、强辯日飛機在滿偵察非作戰行爲、純因滿鐵沿綫土匪熾盛、欲擾亂滿鐵附屬地、有威脅日僑之勢、故派日飛機偵察、及至日飛機受人攻擊、始抛炸彈云云、（十七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日午後國聨行政會舉行公開會議一小時、决定電致中日兩國政府、促其注意於凱洛格非戰公約下之義務、旋休會、定星期日十一時重行集議、同時送交國聨秘書處之消息、仍如雪片　來、皆與滿洲事件有關、中國代表團現紛紛將南京傳來報告滿洲日軍戰事行動之消息轉送秘書處、日代表團發出宣傳文字、詳說日飛機出現於滿洲之正當、以匪氛日熾、時常危害日僑爲理由、並竭力聲明日本願避免增重時局之誠意、日代表團現切實否認日本要求邀　俄國參加行政會共同討論滿洲問題之說、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聨行政會會員雖值星期日、亦不休息、仍努力辦理爲中日交涉謀取解决之問題、行政會之討論、今日入於一種新局面、蓋已着手爲滿洲難題尋覓調解方案云、午前十一時、除中日代表外、各會員舉行非公開會議、考慮數種草案、其所議定之方案、將提出於明日公開會議、促進中日政府注意其非戰公約下義務之照會、時夜由各委員之曾簽定該約者、分别發出、外交官轉致、照會措詞不同、而命意則、美代表亦同樣辦理、負責方面認召集國聨議會緊急會議之謡言不致實現、此間未知有此計畫、今晨行政會之非公開會議、歷一小時四十分之久、散會時已十二時四十分、明日之公開會議、將於午前十時半開始、意總代表格蘭蒂雖巳往羅隊籌備往游柏林事宜、但或可復返日内瓦參加滿洲問題之最後討論、不過尚未確定耳、意外相往游柏林之期定下星期日、故可留於日内瓦至星期五日、由此直赴德京、此間人士希望行政會此次會議可於星期三日左右結束、今日會議内容、雖極守秘密、但聞對於解决　洲問題之方案、已有進步、擬於明日會議時聽取中日代表對此之意見、時局現稍有進步、今晨會議後、議長白里安语人曰、吾人希望從此事可開始進行、　白里安現將行政會會員致中日兩國之照會、通知簽定非戰公約而非行政會會員之各國、此種通告、雖純屬形式的、但將時局日前情形一一詳告、聽其自行决定同樣步驟之採行、日代表團又以公文一通送交議長、重申日政府對於行政會不通加入美代表一事之意見、此文足見日本迄未改變其日前態度、而猶　美國參加問題非爲手續問題、文中說明日政府確信時局不致有引起戰爭之危險、又謂巴黎非戰公約簽字者、不止一國、而因此獨許美國參加行政會會議、已引起複雜問題、日政府甚欲知行政會所留置日後討論之法律問題、究至何時可以討論云、白里安通告發出後、蘇俄政府有何種舉動、此乃行政會會員所極願知者、查蘇俄乃國聨會員、而非行政會會員、故議長白里安以致中日之照會通知之、議長白里安將於今日答覆日本來文、覆文情詞和緩、但詞意堅决、聲明國聨行政會對於本會之决議、自有權衡云、現悉英法意德挪威已於昨夜由日内瓦以照會直接電致中日兩國、惟美國之照會已由華盛頓發出、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美政府因國聨理事會在解决滿案亦陷於僵局、有召集評議會考慮經濟抵制之說、今日特訓今美代表吉爾伯在理事會中討論、　、以旋用凱洛格非戰公約爲限、其用意　致美國在對中國或日本經濟抵制之計劃上、担負合作任務、現美政府極密切注意日内瓦、希望其終能覓得一解决方法、完全恢復滿洲之和平與秩序、又對於東京亦有密切與焦急之注意、冀或能有减少緊張之兆象、國務院中某君聲稱、美政府料日政府將可信美國僅注意於免除中日間發生戰爭、對於解决之條件若何、完全不注念云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　昨上下午、行政院均有會議、中日兩國代表并未蒞塲、美國觀察員則已參加兩次會議、中間芳澤與白里安晤談甚久、午前十時開會之前、白里安曾接見施博士、聞午後會議芳澤與行政院多數會員將互相辯論、芳澤根據東京電報、以一照會送交白里安、對於美國參加再度抗議、以爲國聨會盟約因此大受妨害白里安即將答覆、明日舉行公開會議、行政院對於當事雙方之提議、屆時當知分曉、據本社昨日所發表、此項提議不外限期撤退日軍、并由中國允認尊重條約保護外人、又行政院爲便利直接交涉起見、亦將提議遣派國際顧問員、用以襄助中國交涉專員、日本堅執不悟、甚屬爲難、障碍亦大、昨日行政院以執行非戰約爲理由、同時照會中國與日本、其效力未必可艱、原因美國一部份輿論、不完全贊成國聨會行政院以非戰公約爲言、使之滿意、并使之對於國聨會之舉動、感有興趣故也、國際老人全體致表决之後、日本仍持異議、中國代表所處地位極佳、蓋除刺探消息信任行政院而外、未必有所舉動也、國聨會迫於事勢、對於中國多所廻護、而行政院考慮辯論方式、與日本心理完全不同、實爲緊要問題、行政院以滿洲時局危及世界和平、芳澤則以遠東事務、與西方政治家所想像者不同、其言有曰、依照渠輩意見、日本利益必致破壞不可收拾、遠東情狀、惟日本乃能加以判斷云云、此種秦越之見、至爲難堪、各國代表對於芳澤之執迷態度未免爲之氣短、芳澤之意、全世界因滿洲事件而受衝動、實無理由可言、中日爭端其重要情形、實亦過於誇大、此層絶非行政院所能承認、（十八日哈瓦斯社電）　　（日内瓦）　明日行政院將請雙方當事國對於和平解决發表意見、白里安逆知雙方必不同意、將代行政院發表意見、據本社所知、本日晨開會時、經西班牙代表愷切發言之後、行政院十三國代表贊成無先决條件撤兵、至日本聲言蘇俄亦須參加及其最後保留、未必見諸實際、觀於東京傳來之報紙言論、即可知之、、（十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>暴日絶未悔禍</h3>
<p>侵我領土偏稱自衞</p>
<p>談判不成决不撤兵</p>
<p>（東京）　日政府預料將接有促其注意或非戰公約下義務及要求撤退南滿鐵路區域外日軍之照會、聞現正預備說明其地位之文告、該文將承認非戰公約反對以戰爭爲國家政策之工具、但將謂九月十八夜日軍在瀋陽外之行動、純出於自衞、而所有以後行動、實爲此基礎事實之天然演進、故並無國家政策、或戰爭意思之問題、非戰公約祇許以和平方法解决國際爭端、是以日本主張與中國直接談判、謀以和平方法解决滿洲時局、日本以爲中國不首先設法向日本協定解决辦法、而遽申訴於國聨、實爲錯誤、日本又以爲國聨接受中國所發日本欲以武力解决紛爭之說、亦屬根本不對、蓋少數日兵在鐵路區域之外、與談判問題無涉也、日兵之在鐵路區域外、乃自衞之連帶行爲、非俟使出兵爲必要之狀况、及日僑生命與財産之危害消滅後、日軍必不撤退云、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　日代表芳澤今日向美聨社通訊員談話、對滿案力爲狡辯、並謂日本非俟與中國直接談判、商得滿意協定保障日僑在滿生命財産之之安全後、不能撤兵、日政府與文官武將一致抱此意見、日本認美國之參加國聨理事會、爲快事件、且有威脅性質、有激動日本人民之虞、（十七日國民社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日政府於十七日命日代表向國聨理事會長白里安提出質問如左、（一）日政府向來盡力於國聨之事業、常努力增進其權威但國聨之行動、不可不確守規約之所定、尤不可爲一時的便宜、而藐視規約之條文、（二）日政府就於美代表之派遣邀請、開陳疑義之所在、求理事會加以考慮、而理事會並不從事各論點之審議、遽視爲手續問題、以過半數可决、將法理的解釋問題、保留於後日、（三）或謂因美爲非戰條約當事國之故、所以關於該條約之適用、可使美國在理事會得有發言機會、但日本政府不但確信現下之事態、無至於中是開戰之危險、且非戰條約爲含有非國際聨盟國十餘國之條約、豈得獨令美代表出席理事會有發言之機會、（四）遽以過半數可可决「議案之决定應當依過半數抑應當依全體致之問題、保留於　　國聨行政會照會中日兩國注意非戰公約義務洮昂路戰事已停新民縣城外南台子村被匪攻陷華北英艦全數開滬（見國内要電）　大發明家愛迪生逝世（見國外要電）滬西日人尋釁（見本埠新聞）</p>

<p>將來、」不得謂爲愼重嚴正之行動、所謂保留至他日之法律問題、　將以如何之機機會議論之乎、其討論結果與十五日之票决之關係如何乎、日政府甚望在未决定關於今日　提議全部問題之態度以前、知悉理事會議長關於右諸點之意見、（十八日日聨電）</p>
<p>（東京）　負責方面雖不信國聨行政會將援用會章第十六條、但日内瓦來電、今言及其可能、致使若干民衆方面發生極不幸之印象、美代表甫加入行政會、復繼以援用第十六條之說、愈使人起盎格洛薩克遜國家現聨合乘機予日本以打擊之想像、各負責方面以爲如再有此種採用裁制條欵之說、將害多而益少、但此種言論、不能嚇倒日本、徒可引起排外情愫、而爲反動派所利用、致愈增政府謀和平解决之困難云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>國聨會章第十六條與非戰公約第二條附後</p>
<p>國聨會章第十六條聨合會會員如有不顧本約第十二條第十三條或第十五條所定之規約、而從事戰爭者、則據此事實、應即視爲對於所有聨合會其他會員有戰爭行爲、其他各會員擔任立即與之斷絶各種商業上或財政上之關係、禁止其人民與破壞盟約國人民各種往來、並阻止其他任何國爲聨合會會員或非聨合會會員人民、與該國之人民財政上商業上或個人之往來、</p>
<p>遇此情形、行政院應負向關係各政府建議之責、俾聨合會各會員各出陸海空之實力、組成軍隊、以維護聨合會盟約之實行、</p>
<p>又聨合會會員約定、當按照本條適用財政上及經濟上應採之辦法、彼此互相扶助、因此所致之損失與困難、減至最少點、如破壞盟約國對於聨合會中之一會員施在任何特殊辦法、亦應互相扶助以抵制之、其協同維護聨合會盟約之聨合會、任何會員之軍隊、應取必要方法、予以假道　便利、</p>

<h3>非戰公約之勸告又如何</h3>
<p>十六日美國代表吉爾白以奉到其本國政府之訓令正式列席國聨行政會議時。自大會主席白里安以次。各國之政治家外交家。都譽揚備至。一月以來陰霾蔽空一籌莫展之國聨。亦一若以華盛頓代表之正式參加遂頓呈活氣。全世界人民都注視諦聽。屏息以待伸張公理維護和平之佳音從日内瓦方面播送而出。蓋此時國聨已達到眞正執行之時期。人類未來之命運即將於此三數日内判分也。</p>
<p>據今日電訊。在十二國秘密會議中。美代表列席結果主張勸告中日兩國遵守非戰公約第二條之規定停止足以破壞世界和平之行動此與國聨九月三十日休會時之决議。如出一聲。與其謂爲新的决議。母寗謂爲舊調重彈　　九月三十日國聨行政會議勸告日本於十月十四以前儘速撤退軍隊日代表芳澤旣已正式接受。然而延至十月十四。日軍盤踞我東北也如故而其暴行更有加無已。今且毅然直言决不撤兵。日人旣已斷然蹂躙國聨之威信於九月三十以後。茲復何有於非戰公約。復何有於重申前說國聨盟約旣已負創傷。非戰公約乃復踐其舊跡奮勇而來。吾人誠不識非戰公約有無「護身之符。」其發言是否遂眞可以裁制横暴。使日人俯首承受其覊勒中國自始迄終。徹頭徹尾。維護世界和平。靜候世界公斷於日人之暴力横臨終始退讓。中國固絶未違犯非戰公約第二條之規定也。固不必列席秘密會議之各代表。第二次誠懇之勸告也。中國目前之所要求者。爲解除當前暴力之壓迫。伸展人類共有之正義中國全體人民所忍死企盼於國聨者在此所殷切期望於非戰公約者亦在此。</p>
<p>自日軍暴行發生以至今日。業已一月有餘。亘一月以來之光陰全世界政治家外交家焦思苦慮。罄其心力。今日秘密會議。明日會外接洽侃侃而言齗齗而辯。而日軍則於國聨諸公之焦思苦慮。毫無顧惜曾不以此而稍歛戢其暴行。爲國聨留　線。之體面與威信。日内瓦議塲中之高談闊論聲與日飛機在我東北投擲炸彈之炸裂聲。隔歐亞大陸而遥相應和國聨諸公聞此應聲否。華盛頓政府代表聞此巨響否。設使日人終始貫澈其强硬手段藐視第二次之勸告。非戰公約亦竟不能制止其暴行。吾人不知國聨諸公是否已準備請出九國協約之第三道靈符。</p>
<p>自九月十八日以。來日人所加諸中國之暴行。世界各國。有耳共聞。有目共見。此種暴行之足以危害世界。危害全人類。世界人士應亦不言共喻故今日之事。誰曲誰直。誰爲破壞和平之罪魁。誰爲全人類之公敵以及如何裁制如何使罪人承受其責任。但使國際盟約國有維持盟約維護公理保障和平之决心。則上述諸問題之解决。並無若何困難。如其不然。則焦思奚益。會議奚益勸告又奚益。</p>
<p>國際如一大舞台。各國政治上活動之人物即爲戲劇之扮演者此種譬喻證之今日之事。吾人不能不認爲確切。蓋國聨今日集十四國之政治家外交家於一堂。其所排演者不啻一齣滑稽喜劇而已。以美國代表之參加。使此喜劇更爲滑稽。然而吾人深信此滑稽喜劇之最後。即將爲絶世悲劇之開始。　　中國無疑義的爲未來悲劇中之主角。然而全世界各國又寗能超然於悲劇扮演之大舞台必將舉全人類而同歸於盡。世界各國果已有此决心乎。吾人誠一致禱祝此末刦之不早日到來。</p>

<h3>League of Nations Emphasizes the Kellogg-Briand Pact</h3>
<p>The League Informs Both Chinese and Japanese Governments to Pay Attention to Treaty Obligations, Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway Battles Cease, Zhang HaiPeng's Army Retreats South, Japanese Incite Bandits to Burn and Loot Rampantly Outside Xinmin County</p>
<h3>League of Nations Stalled in Stalemate</h3>
<p>Plan to Convene a Special Meeting, Telegraph to China and Japan to Pay Attention to the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<p>(Geneva) The current situation regarding the development of the Manchurian Incident at the League of Nations is summarized below: (1) The current Council is seeking a solution but is deadlocked. (2) Proposals to convene a special Council meeting are being discussed smoothly. (3) Japan declares that it will not withdraw its troops until it reaches an agreement with China through direct negotiations. (4) The Council members decided to send separate letters to China and Japan reminding them of their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (5) Japan continues to oppose the United States' participation in the Council. (6) The US government instructs its representatives not to participate in discussions on economic sanctions against China or Japan. (7) The US press has mixed opinions on whether to participate in the Council. (8) There are proposals to implement sanctions or economic boycotts. (9) The League of Nations wants to awaken world opinion and moral forces to pressure the Chinese and Japanese governments. (National News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It has been learned from extremely reliable sources that the Council, in its secret meeting today, made significant progress in discussing the convening of a special Council meeting. If the current stalemate cannot be broken, this matter will be implemented. The task of the Council Assembly is likely to discuss whether to use sanctions or economic boycotts to resolve the Sino-Japanese crisis, or perhaps the entire Manchurian Incident will be brought before the Council to awaken world opinion. However, the currently discussed economic boycott plan, especially the cooperation between the UK and the US, will certainly be deemed unfeasible. As for convening a special Council meeting, there was a precedent in 1926 when the issue of Germany joining the League was discussed. It is heard that in tonight's secret meeting of the Council members, the procedures for the Secretary-General to immediately convene a special Council meeting were discussed.</p>
<p>Another dispatch reports that, after a continued secret meeting of the Council members tonight, there is still no way to resolve the Manchurian Incident. Discussions will continue tomorrow. All Council members attending today, including the US representative, agreed to send another letter to the governments of China and Japan reminding them of their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact, especially the obligation under Article 2 to use arbitration as a method of resolving international disputes. According to reliable sources, tonight's secret meeting began at 6 o'clock, and the discussion items were the same as in the morning meeting, first discussing ways to awaken world opinion and moral forces to pressure the Chinese and Japanese governments, and then considering the possibility of further action based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 pm. The US representatives attended both the morning and evening meetings, but the Chinese and Japanese representatives did not attend. Before tonight's secret meeting, Briand had a long conversation with Japanese representative Yoshizawa, but due to Japan's continued insistence on opposing US participation, opposing troop withdrawal, and advocating direct negotiations, there were no significant results. Also, today Yoshizawa informed the Council, strongly arguing that Japanese aircraft reconnaissance in Manchuria was not an act of war but purely because bandits were rampant along the South Manchuria Railway, attempting to disrupt the South Manchuria Railway's affiliated areas and threatening Japanese residents, so Japanese aircraft were dispatched for reconnaissance, and only when Japanese aircraft were attacked did they drop bombs. (National News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the League of Nations Council held a public meeting for one hour, deciding to send a telegram to the governments of China and Japan, urging them to pay attention to their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and then adjourned the meeting, scheduling a new meeting for 11 o'clock on Sunday. At the same time, news delivered to the League of Nations Secretariat continues to pour in like snowflakes, all related to the Manchurian Incident. The Chinese delegation is now actively forwarding reports from Nanjing regarding the war actions of the Japanese army in Manchuria to the Secretariat. The Japanese delegation issued propaganda materials, detailing the justification for Japanese aircraft appearing in Manchuria, citing the increasing banditry that constantly endangers Japanese residents as a reason, and vigorously declaring Japan's sincerity in avoiding escalating the situation. The Japanese delegation now firmly denies the claim that Japan requested to invite Russia to participate in the Council's joint discussion of the Manchurian issue. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although it is Sunday, the members of the League of Nations Council are not resting and are still working hard to find a solution for the Sino-Japanese negotiations. The Council's discussions have entered a new phase today, as they have begun to seek a mediation plan for the Manchurian problem. At 11:00 AM, excluding the Chinese and Japanese representatives, the members held a non-public meeting to consider several draft plans. The plan they agreed upon will be submitted to the public meeting tomorrow. The notes to promote the Chinese and Japanese governments to pay attention to their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact will be issued separately by each committee member who has signed the treaty, conveyed by diplomats, with different wording but the same meaning. The US representatives will do the same. Those responsible believe that rumors of convening an emergency meeting of the League of Nations Assembly will not materialize. It is unknown here if there is such a plan. This morning's non-public meeting of the Council lasted for one hour and forty minutes, adjourning at 12:40 PM. Tomorrow's public meeting will begin at 10:30 AM. Although Italian representative Grandi has gone to Rome to prepare for his trip to Berlin, he may return to Geneva to participate in the final discussion of the Manchurian issue, but it is not yet certain. The unexpected trip to Berlin is scheduled for next Sunday, so he can stay in Geneva until Friday and go directly to the German capital. People here hope that this Council meeting can end around Wednesday. Although the content of today's meeting is kept extremely secret, it is heard that there has been progress in the plan to resolve the Manchurian problem, and the opinions of the Chinese and Japanese representatives on this will be heard at tomorrow's meeting. The situation has made some progress. After this morning's meeting, Council President Briand said to people, "We hope that this matter can begin to proceed." Briand is now notifying all countries that have signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact but are not members of the Council of the Council members' notes to China and Japan. Although this notification is purely formal, it will detail the current situation and allow them to decide whether to take the same steps. The Japanese delegation also sent a document to the President, reiterating the Japanese government's opinion on the Council's failure to include the US representative, believing that this greatly hinders the League's covenant. Briand will state in his reply that the Council has the right to weigh the resolutions of the Council. It is now learned that the UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Norway sent notes directly to China and Japan from Geneva last night, while the US note was sent from Washington. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Because the League of Nations Council is also stalled in resolving the Manchurian Incident, and there are rumors of convening a Council to consider economic boycotts, the US government today specifically instructed its US representative, Gilbert, to discuss in the Council, but only to the extent of using the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The intention is to prevent the United States from undertaking cooperative tasks in plans for economic boycotts against China or Japan. The US government is now paying close attention to Geneva, hoping that it will eventually find a solution to fully restore peace and order in Manchuria. It is also paying close and anxious attention to Tokyo, hoping for signs of reduced tension. Someone in the State Department claimed that the US government expects the Japanese government to believe that the US is only concerned with preventing a war between China and Japan, and is completely unconcerned about the conditions for resolution.

<p>(Geneva) Yesterday morning and afternoon, the Council had meetings. Representatives from China and Japan did not attend the meeting, but the US observer attended both meetings. Yoshizawa and Briand had a long talk in between. Before the meeting opened at 10:00 AM, Briand received Dr. Shi. It is heard that in the afternoon meeting, Yoshizawa and most members of the Council will debate each other. Yoshizawa submitted a note to Briand based on a telegram from Tokyo, protesting the US participation again, believing that the League of Nations covenant was greatly harmed as a result. Briand will reply immediately, and a public meeting will be held tomorrow. The Council will know the proposals of both parties at that time. According to what our newspaper published yesterday, these proposals are no more than setting a deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops, and China agreeing to respect the treaty and protect foreigners. Also, in order to facilitate direct negotiations, the Council will also propose sending international advisors to assist the Chinese negotiating commissioners. Japan's stubbornness makes it very difficult, and the obstacles are great. Yesterday, the Council sent notes to both China and Japan at the same time on the grounds of implementing the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but its effectiveness may not be guaranteed. The reason is that a part of US public opinion does not completely support the League of Nations Council taking the Kellogg-Briand Pact as a basis, making them satisfied and making them interested in the actions of the League of Nations Council. After all the international elders voted, Japan still held different opinions. The position of the Chinese representative is extremely good, because besides exploring news and trusting the Council, there may not be any actions. The Council is forced by the situation to provide a lot of protection to China, and the way the Council considers and debates is completely different from the Japanese psychology, which is a crucial issue. The Council believes that the situation in Manchuria endangers world peace, while Yoshizawa believes that the affairs of the Far East are different from what Western politicians imagine. He said that according to their opinions, Japan's interests will inevitably be destroyed beyond repair, and only Japan can judge the situation in the Far East. This kind of view, which treats each other as strangers, is extremely difficult, and the representatives of various countries are inevitably discouraged by Yoshizawa's obsession. Yoshizawa's intention is that the whole world is agitated by the Manchurian Incident, and there is no reason to say it. The important situation of the Sino-Japanese dispute is actually exaggerated, and this point is absolutely not recognized by the Council. (Havas dispatch, 18th) (Geneva) Tomorrow, the Council will ask both parties concerned to express their opinions on the peaceful resolution. Briand knows in advance that both parties will disagree, and will express his opinions on behalf of the Council. According to our newspaper, when the meeting opened this morning, after the Spanish representative, Cortejarena, spoke, the representatives of the thirteen countries of the Council agreed to withdraw their troops without preconditions. As for Japan's statement that Russia must also participate and its final reservations, it may not be realized. You can know this by looking at the newspaper comments from Tokyo.

<h3>Brutal Japan Shows No Remorse</h3>
<p>Claims Self-Defense While Invading Our Territory</p>
<p>Will Never Withdraw Troops if Negotiations Fail</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government expects to receive notes urging it to pay attention to its obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact and demanding the withdrawal of Japanese troops outside the South Manchuria Railway area. It is heard that it is now preparing a statement explaining its position. The statement will acknowledge the Kellogg-Briand Pact's opposition to the use of war as an instrument of national policy, but will say that the actions of the Japanese army outside Shenyang on the night of September 18th were purely out of self-defense, and all subsequent actions were a natural evolution of this fundamental fact, so there is no issue of national policy or the intention of war. The Kellogg-Briand Pact only allows for the resolution of international disputes by peaceful means, so Japan advocates direct negotiations with China to seek a peaceful solution to the Manchurian situation. Japan believes that it was a mistake for China to file a complaint with the League of Nations without first trying to agree on a solution with Japan. Japan also believes that the League of Nations' acceptance of China's statement that Japan wants to resolve disputes by force is also fundamentally wrong, because a small number of Japanese soldiers are outside the railway area and have nothing to do with the negotiation issue. The presence of Japanese soldiers outside the railway area is a concomitant act of self-defense, and the Japanese army will not withdraw until the situation where the dispatch of troops is necessary and the harm to the lives and property of Japanese residents is eliminated. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese representative Yoshizawa spoke to the American League Press correspondent today, vigorously defending the Manchurian Incident, and said that Japan cannot withdraw its troops until it negotiates directly with China and reaches a satisfactory agreement to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in Manchuria. The Japanese government, both civilian and military officials, unanimously hold this opinion. Japan considers the US participation in the League of Nations Council to be a hasty event and a threat, which may incite the Japanese people. (National News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) On the 17th, the Japanese government ordered its representative to raise the following questions to Briand, the chairman of the League of Nations Council: (1) The Japanese government has always been devoted to the cause of the League of Nations and has always strived to enhance its authority, but the actions of the League of Nations must strictly adhere to the provisions of the covenant and must not disregard the provisions of the covenant for the sake of temporary expediency. (2) The Japanese government raised doubts about the dispatch and invitation of US representatives and asked the Council to consider them, but the Council did not engage in the review of each point and hastily regarded it as a procedural matter, decided by a majority vote, and reserved the legal interpretation issue for the future. (3) Some say that because the US is a party to the anti-war treaty, the US can have the opportunity to speak in the Council regarding the application of the treaty, but the Japanese government not only firmly believes that the current situation does not involve the danger of opening war, but also the anti-war treaty is a treaty that contains more than a dozen non-League of Nations countries, so how can it be allowed to allow the US representatives to attend the Council and have the opportunity to speak alone. (4) Hastily deciding to "decide whether the decision of the motion should be based on a majority vote or a unanimous vote" by a majority vote, and reserving "the legal issue to be discussed in the future" cannot be said to be a cautious and solemn action. On what occasion will the so-called legal issues reserved for other days be discussed? How will the result of the discussion relate to the vote on the 15th? The Japanese government hopes to know the opinions of the President of the Council on the above points before deciding on the attitude towards all the proposals today. (Japan United Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although those in charge do not believe that the League of Nations Council will invoke Article 16 of the charter, the telegram from Geneva, which now speaks of its possibility, has caused extremely unfortunate impressions among some of the public. The US representatives have just joined the Council, followed by the claim to invoke Article 16, which makes people imagine that the Anglo-Saxon countries are now uniting to take the opportunity to strike Japan. Those in charge believe that if there is any further talk of adopting sanctions, it will do more harm than good, but this kind of talk cannot scare Japan, it can only arouse anti-foreign sentiments and be used by reactionaries, which will increase the government's difficulty in seeking a peaceful solution. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant and Article 2 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact are attached below:</p>
<p>Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant: Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not.</p>
<p>It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.</p>
<p>The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting therefrom, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State. and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.</p>
<p>Any Member of the League which has violated one of the covenants of the League may be declared to be no longer a Member of the League by a vote of the representatives of the other Members of the League represented at a meeting of the Council.</p>
<p>Kellogg-Briand Pact Article 2: The High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means.</p>

(Reuters Dispatch on the 18th) A Glimpse of Public Opinion in Various Countries (Paris) The theory of the Executive Yuan is very different from the claims of Japan. All newspapers know this. Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, they still believe that a method can be obtained to gradually resolve it. "Le Volontaire" reported that Japan has retreated in Geneva. The Executive Yuan, regardless of Japan's firm opposition, recognized the participation of the United States, and its ambition to transcend everything has a very positive impact whether on the Pacific coast or in Geneva. Twelve countries will force China and Japan to respect their promises and avoid war with all their strength. The significance of this move in spirit and politics cannot be ignored. It should be regarded as a serious warning, especially in Tokyo, because all major powers want to maintain peace in the Far East, and their concept of joint responsibility is not just empty talk. "Le Temps" praised Briand's power and competence, and said that the united action of the major powers should be known to Japan, and should be known as soon as possible. "L'Action Française" said that there are two achievements: first, Japan's legal opposition was invalidated, and the American observer was finally invited; second, the Sino-Japanese dispute is regarded as a touchstone for the future of the League of Nations. Thanks to Briand's courage, the League of Nations has proved its own value and its spiritual power. It is known that the League of Nations is a court for all nations in the world, and although people do not want to admit it, its intentions cannot be ignored. (Havas Dispatch on the 18th) The London Sunday Times commented on Japan's opposition to the League of Nations Executive Council's invitation to the United States to participate in the discussion of the Sino-Japanese issue, saying that this position is intolerable. If the actions of the Executive Council are prevented simply because one of the disputing parties does not agree with the procedures of the League of Nations, then what is the use of the League of Nations? Therefore, this difficulty must be overcome. The current dispute is not about Manchuria, but about Japan's refusal to peacefully resolve this dispute through the highest international organization of which Japan is also a member. Opposition to the participation of the United States is something that Japan should not do and will inevitably lose sympathy from all over the world. Japan should not maintain this attitude, and for its own benefit, it should immediately telegraph its Geneva representative to withdraw its opposition, which should not have been considered. (Reuters Dispatch on the 18th) The New York American newspapers have mixed opinions on the United States' participation in the League of Nations Council's discussion of the Sino-Japanese issue. The newspapers are now very concerned about the League of Nations' efforts to mediate the dispute, and they are not paying as much attention to the news coming from China as before. (Guomin News Agency Dispatch on the 17th) (Moscow) Izvestia criticized the League of Nations Executive Council's invitation to the United States to participate, saying that Japan has consolidated its economic and military position in South Manchuria, and now wants to expand its economic and political sphere of influence and encompass the entire South Manchuria. American imperialism wants to interfere, but is worried about tensions in relations leading to war between the United States and Japan, so it wants to implement its anti-Japanese policy under the international flag launched by the League of Nations. The newspaper also said that France and Britain have not expressed any special preparations to go to war with Japan. Since the European War, France has tried its best to befriend Japanese imperialism in order to facilitate its assistance to France's anti-German policy. Therefore, this League of Nations meeting may not have any righteous actions. Japan's desired goals in Manchuria are quite clear and may not have any concerns about being rejected.

After arriving in Shanghai, he will consult with Jiang Hu and others, and everything can be resolved. The foreign troubles are now very urgent, and Guangdong does not want to sing high-pitched tunes. As for the Manchuria case, the international situation in the League of Nations has improved due to the participation of the United States. However, the future results are still worrisome, because Japan is forced by international justice to formally return the Eastern Provinces, but the essence of the Eastern Provinces has been stripped away. This point is the most important. We should argue with reason in the League of Nations and expose the Japanese conspiracy. Therefore, Yu and Youren went to Shanghai to strive for this matter.

His wife, six children, and doctors were all by his side when he died. Guomin, West Orange, October 18 Thomas Edison, a world-renowned genius in the field of invention, passed away at 3:24 this morning at his home here at the age of 84. His family was gathered around his bed to see him off. Mr. Edison had been suffering from old age for several weeks and finally died of physical exhaustion. Medicine was ineffective. He had been in a coma for more than eight days without being able to eat. More than 10,000 condolence letters and telegrams from all over the world. The news of his death this morning shocked and mourned the entire United States. Portrait of Edison A Brief Biography of Edison Edison is known to the world as an inventor, but he only wishes to call himself an electrician. He often said that the progress of machinery greatly increases true civilization. If this is true, then his efforts to promote civilization have been more than anyone else. In forty years, he obtained patents for no less than 700 inventions, such as the phonograph, the movie camera, and the carbon filament in the electric light, which are the most famous. Mr. Edison was born on February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio, USA. His family was very poor, and even the basic necessities of life were often lacking. At the age of seven, he moved to Port Huron, Michigan. He was unable to attend school and was educated by his mother. At the age of twelve, he sold newspapers on the train to make a living. At the age of sixteen, he became a telegrapher. Five years later, he invented an electrical watt counter and obtained a patent. This was his first achievement, but it was not sold on the market. Therefore, he used his intelligence to study things needed by the public. The following year, he obtained a position at the New York Telegraph Company. Because he had saved the son of a certain director from a disaster, he was quite favored. Therefore, he was able to calmly study everything. At the age of twenty-three, he invented the stock ticker and received 40,000 yuan in remuneration. When he brought it to be priced, the buyer asked how much he wanted. Edison wanted to ask for 5,000 yuan, but he hesitated and did not dare to say it. The buyer asked him again and again, but he remained silent. The buyer said, "How about 40,000 yuan?" When Edison heard this, he was overjoyed and his breathing became rapid. At the age of nearly thirty, he finally took out his savings and set up a chemical laboratory and factory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Many of his ingenious inventions were produced there. In 1891, he invented the movie camera. From 1917 to 1918, he invented dozens of wartime supplies. Because the United States joined the European War at that time, Mr. Edison used his entire factory to serve the country. It is said that there are still some wartime products of even greater value that are secretly preserved by the US government and have not been made public to the world. The objects invented by Mr. Edison, except for the phonograph, which was obtained by chance, were all the result of painstaking efforts and multiple experiments. Therefore, Mr. Edison often said, "What I have obtained is all from hard work and perseverance. Enlightenment accounts for one percent, and sweat accounts for ninety-nine percent." When Mr. Edison wanted to make something or improve something, he would sit quietly and meditate until he succeeded. Mr. Edison's hearing was impaired due to being slapped in the face when he was young. Mr. Edison once said that his deafness not only helped him think, but also prevented his mind from being disturbed by external things. In essence, Mr. Edison's life is actually a history of the progressive scientific achievements of the past fifty years. In 1927, on Mr. Edison's eightieth birthday, reporters from major American newspapers went to congratulate him and asked him to answer various questions. Mr. Edison said that science can never create life. Radio is beneficial to the world, but it impairs the value of music. Whether radio can transmit power in the future is a question. Mr. Edison also said that he does not believe in telepathy or spiritualism, but he firmly believes that there is an all-knowing being who rules the universe. Bolivia's Old Grudges Have Not Been Resolved and There is a Risk of Diplomatic Rupture Between the Two Countries The National News Agency, Washington, October 17 The two republics of South America, Bolivia and Paraguay, had a border incident between border guards a few weeks ago. In addition, the Chaco land dispute from several years ago, although arbitration avoided a split, has not been fundamentally resolved. Now, because of the new events, old grudges have been stirred up, and there is a great risk of diplomatic rupture between the two countries. Today, the United States, Cuba, Uruguay, Mexico, and Colombia have applied for the other fourteen countries in Latin America to consider methods to save the two countries from war. National Election Situation Reuters, London, October 17 Labor Party leader Henderson refuted Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden's claim that the person who issued the Labor Party's declaration against tax rates was the first person in the cabinet to propose tax rates, saying that it was contrary to the facts. The Labor Party members who left the cabinet only stated that they were willing to consider the possibility of temporary tax rates and were unwilling to support the reduction of unemployment benefits, but they never proposed tax rates. The election competition is in progress. A newspaper said this morning that Liberal Party leader George will join the socialist party after he recovers from his illness. After meeting with Labor Party leader Henderson recently, George is preparing to resign as Liberal Party leader and gather left-wing Liberal Party members to form a new party, which may be merged with Henderson and the socialists in the future. In the election scene, the National Government Party is the most dominant, but Prime Minister MacDonald's fate in the Seaham Harbour constituency is still uncertain. Success or failure is difficult to predict. Also, Labor Party Henderson is also encountering a strong opponent in the Burnley constituency, a Rear Admiral Campbell selected by the Conservative Party, who is quite reputable, so the competition will be very fierce. Dutch Economic Panic Affected by Britain's Suspension of the Gold Standard Reuters, The Hague, October 18 The Dutch economic situation is gradually deteriorating, which is the result of Britain's suspension of the gold standard. According to the report of the Second Chamber Committee, Dutch exports to Britain account for more than one-fifth of all Dutch exports, but now they have been greatly reduced, while imports of British goods have increased. Reuters, The Hague, October 18 According to the report of the Congressional Committee studying the external budget, the results of the League of Nations' work are gradually disappointing. Some members of the committee even expressed that the Netherlands should withdraw from the League of Nations, but most members believe that withdrawal is not an issue.

<p>People's Whereabouts: Naval Vice-Minister Chen Shaokuan arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning around 7:00 AM. He immediately proceeded to the Jiangnan Shipyard at Gaochang Temple to handle important official business. Around 9:00 AM, he inspected the Jiang Yuan warship, which was undergoing repairs in the dock. He also personally questioned the ship's captain, Shi Guoxian, about the Jiang Yuan's sinking. However, he did not express any opinion regarding the handling of those responsible for the ship. He then visited the Minsheng warship for a week of inspection before visiting Minister Yang on Avenue Joffre. He returned to Beijing on the Shanghai-Nanjing express train around 2:00 PM. The fourth session of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters' Executive and Supervisory Committee has been determined by the central government. The swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for the 19th of this month. Zhang Daofan has been dispatched by the central government to oversee the swearing-in. Zhang departed from Shanghai for Hangzhou last night. Chen Songyuan has been released. Bao Yu and Mao Lianke were released at the same time. Xie Da Xiang's manager has been imprisoned again.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The National Society reports that the manager of Xie Da Xiang foreign cloth store at Xiaodongmen in this city was imprisoned for privately selling Japanese goods and for having anti-Japanese inspectors detained at the police station, and that Bao Yu and Mao Lianke, who were protecting Chen Songyuan, an executive committee member of the Anti-Japanese Association, brandished guns in a show of force. It was reported in yesterday's newspaper that other executive committee members of the association had explained the misunderstanding to all the staff. Initially, due to the importance of the anti-Japanese mission, the staff refused to release them. However, around 11:00 PM, after careful consideration of the situation and detailed explanation of the misunderstanding by Chen Xi, the head of the Public Security Bureau, and Wu Kaixian, an executive committee member of the Party Headquarters, Chen Songyuan and Mao Lianke were released. However, the manager of Xie Da Xiang, Ling Zhiping, and the traveling salesman Ye Jingming were subsequently detained. The association, considering that the issue of Xie Da Xiang and other foreign cloth stores privately selling Japanese goods and Chen Songyuan's protection of unscrupulous merchants had not been resolved, convened a representative assembly of various industry trade unions yesterday morning. Representatives from the coal gas industry union, the tenth district cotton spinning union, the railway catering union, the paper fan industry union, and many other groups, totaling twenty-four organizations, attended. The association reported the details of the inspection to the public. After discussion, it was decided to report to all parties to draw social attention to the matter. Representatives were also sent to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters. The report of the incident is transcribed below:</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: We, having been appointed to investigate the Xie Da Xiang case, along with Comrade Wang from the Investigation Department and Comrade Zhou from the Southern District Inspection Office, went to Xie Da Xiang. We found that some of the Japanese goods had been sealed by the trade association, but most of the remaining Japanese goods had not been sealed. We requested the manager of the store to provide the order book and the import clearing ledger for our inspection. The manager suddenly refused. We stated that if the books were not provided, we would have to take custody of all the Japanese goods. Subsequently, the accountant provided the books. Upon inspection, we found many newly imported and suspicious Japanese goods. We informed the manager that we would like to go to the Anti-Japanese Association to clarify whether these goods were Japanese. Unexpectedly, the manager left without a word and reported the matter to the French Concession police station. About forty or fifty French police officers arrived. A traveling salesman from the store raised his hand and struck Wang and others. The police then arrested Wang Wen, Wu Zhi, Guo Jiguang, and three others. Seeing the situation worsen, we requested the store to restrain the police, but the crowd from the store applauded and laughed. We were unable to continue our work and could not list all the Japanese goods for sealing. We had no choice but to temporarily seal all the goods and await instructions from the association. Afterward, we accompanied Team Leader Cai from the Second Team to Xin Da Xiang to check the accounts for any newly imported Japanese goods. The manager of the store provided the account books, which we took back to the association for detailed examination. We also went to Yuan Chang Xiang to investigate. We asked the manager and accountant of the store to provide the account books, but the staff stated that they were not at home. We requested to see the account books to check for any newly imported goods. The staff stated that the books were in the overseas shipping crates. We requested to seal the crates first and asked them to inform the Anti-Japanese Association by telephone when the manager or accountant returned so that someone could come to unseal the crates and verify the account books. The staff stated that the manager would arrive in one hour. We waited for one and a half hours, but neither the manager nor the accountant returned to the store. Only someone sent by the trade association arrived to seal the Japanese goods. We asked that if the Anti-Japanese Association did not come to inspect, the trade association would not come to seal either, and that this type of Japanese goods was likely newly imported. We requested that the account books be provided to verify whether the goods were newly imported and that the Japanese goods not be sealed, but instead kept in the custody of the Anti-Japanese Association for verification. While we were managing the seizure of goods, Committee Member Chen Songyuan arrived at the store and stated, "What kind of order do you have to inspect the goods? You cannot inspect the goods without reporting to the trade association. These goods cannot be moved. If you want to move the goods, you must get my order." He then grabbed the hand of the bodyguard, who then drew a pistol and stood behind him. The committee member then stated, "If you want to move these goods, don't blame me for being impolite." (Meaning, he would use the pistol.) Seeing the situation worsen, fearing an unwarranted tragedy, we asked Committee Member Chen whether he could take full responsibility for the store. The committee member patted his chest and stated that he could be responsible. "If a committee member cannot be responsible, who can? However, you cannot come to inspect without my permission." We stated that this was our responsibility and that we could not be corrupt and do nothing. The committee member then instructed the bodyguard to escort us into a car. We requested the committee member to explain the situation at the association so that it would not appear that we had released this large quantity of Japanese goods. Committee Member Chen had used a pistol to pressure the inspectors and obstruct the seizure of goods. This matter concerns the reputation of the association and the future of anti-Japanese salvation of the country. Therefore, we are submitting this document for your review. (The rest omitted.)</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Association Sends Letter to Minhang Chamber of Commerce, Giving Unscrupulous Merchants Three Days to Hand Over Japanese Goods</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>One Perpetrator Arrested; Hunt for Remaining Fugitives Intensified</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee went to Minhang on the 15th of this month to inspect Japanese goods but were met with resistance from unscrupulous merchants Wang Xieshun, Xin Xiechangxiang, and Dong Huida, who refused inspection and then gathered local ruffians to beat and injure the committee's secretary, Chen Guoan, and destroy a long-distance bus in an attempt to incite a riot. Details of this case have been reported in this newspaper. It has been learned that since the incident, there has been widespread outrage from all sectors of society. Various agencies and organizations in the county have issued declarations, advocating for severe sanctions against the unscrupulous merchants to facilitate the anti-Japanese movement and save the country. The latest news is as follows:</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Response from the Sanlin Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Sanlin Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai County issued a declaration yesterday, which was forwarded to all sectors of the country by various newspapers: "Unfortunately, at a time when our country is suffering from severe floods, the imperialists of Japan are taking advantage of the situation and suddenly sending troops to forcibly occupy our Northeast. The people of our country, under the oppression of powerful forces, have no choice but to adopt the only means of economic severance to relieve the national crisis. All citizens should be resolute and united, vowing to do their utmost. However, the unscrupulous merchants of Minhang in our county, including Xin Xiechangxiang, Wang Xieshun, and Dong Huida, have begun selling Japanese goods and resisting inspection teams, and have beaten officials of the National Salvation Association. News of these events is deeply regrettable. These unscrupulous merchants are the public enemies of the nation and the scum of the business community, lost to all reason and beyond redemption. Our chamber of commerce vows to be the vanguard for the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the county, advocating for strict investigation to appease the people of the country. We hope that all sectors of the country will rise up together to eliminate the traitors and resist the national crisis. This is our declaration."</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Letter to the Minhang Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: On the 15th of this month, all standing committee members of our association went to Minhang to inspect Japanese goods and were obstructed by unscrupulous merchants Wang Xieshun, Dong Huida, Xin Xiechangxiang, Ye Yuda, and others, who gathered hooligans to abuse and insult the inspectors. It has been resolved at the Third Joint Session of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of our association to require merchants who refuse inspection to voluntarily send all Japanese goods to the Minhang Chamber of Commerce within three days for sealing by our association. The three stores should also publish an apology in the newspapers. Therefore, we are writing to inform you to notify the stores to send all Japanese goods to your association within three days for sealing by our association and to publish an apology in the major Shanghai newspapers. This matter concerns the work of anti-Japanese salvation. Please investigate and handle it accordingly.</p>

It has been reported that the Anti-Japanese Association has sent a letter to the County Government instructing the Public Security Bureau to intensify the search.</p>

<p>Li Chengzhi's Views on National Salvation Through Science</p>
<p>Lawyer Li Chengzhi of this city, recognizing the urgency of foreign invasion and the lack of effective measures despite the patriotic fervor of the people, has proposed the idea of saving the nation through science and is seeking like-minded collaborators. The main points are as follows: "Unfortunately, the Chinese people have suffered repeated misfortunes in recent years, and the nation is extremely weak. Now, it is facing foreign invasion, and the future is perilous. Since the Japanese military invaded our Northeast, it has been a month. The authorities have appealed to the League of Nations but have no other response methods. Although many compatriots are fervently patriotic, their efforts only amount to passive resistance, lacking in real strength. In this critical time of survival, if the Chinese people do not quickly seek to save the nation, destruction may be inevitable. It is imperative that the entire nation work together to shoulder the responsibility of saving the nation. A glimmer of hope may still be preserved. However, the way to save the nation cannot rely on empty words. To ensure the soundness of the nation, it is necessary to gather sufficient strength, adopt effective methods, and strive to implement them. Organizing groups to concentrate capabilities is an urgent task. The reason for our nation's weakness is the lack of science. The entire nation values empty talk, and all undertakings are mostly in the hands of the ignorant. They are outdated and simplistic, declining day by day, with endless problems and no innovation. The intellectual class knows nothing beyond literary pursuits, far behind the deep practical knowledge of European and American countries. Take Japan as an example. It has become a strong nation in just a few decades of the Meiji Restoration and is now invading us, forcing us to retreat. The reason why they are far superior to us, despite the disparity in size and population, is the effect of science. Therefore, if we want to save ourselves from danger, we must catch up and promote science urgently. To promote science, we must use the power of politics to achieve universal adoption and achieve practical results. If the government wants to fulfill its responsibility to promote science, then politics itself must first be scientific. It should abandon bureaucratic formalities and focus on practical work. It may reduce the scope but must be practical and realistic, and then use its full strength to promote general science. Everything needed in life and everything in the world, no matter how big or small, should be researched, improved, controlled, and utilized by science. Practical affairs should be academic, and all academic pursuits should be practical. When the people have burgeoning and rapidly advancing undertakings, the government will have proactive construction work, and the prosperity of the nation can be assured. However, scientific undertakings rely on collective efforts and cannot be achieved by one or two people. Now that the nation is in danger, promotion is especially important. All wise individuals in the country, whether in office or not, should use their knowledge and expertise to plan and propose ideas, first to prepare for unity and then to seek practical ways to promote science, to avoid empty talk of saving the nation. The area and population of our Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are comparable to the three islands of Japan, and they have always been known as the economic hub of Southeast China. Now, to promote science, we should start here, first reforming the municipal administration and starting industries in the major cities of the two provinces, using scientific methods to advance both politics and people's livelihoods, and to promote both academics and material progress. Then, from the cities to the towns, and then from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the whole country. In this way, in a few years, relying on the strength of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, we will be able to resist foreign invasion and have more than enough. I, Li Chengzhi, dare to call out for action, hoping that enlightened people in the country will rise up, so that organizations for national salvation through science can be established as soon as possible, starting with the organization of model cities, improving police and judicial affairs, consolidating and guaranteeing the gathering of scientific talents, striving to serve, and raising capital to establish schools and factories, integrating learning and practice, and then supporting production, striving for construction, creating an enterprising society, cultivating a spirit of service, using capable people to reverse the declining trend, and eliminating national disasters. This is the only way to save the nation. If enlightened people in the country agree with this idea, please give your clear instructions and plan together. I would be very grateful." Li Chengzhi respectfully.</p>

<p>Coal Industry Association Sends Telegram Requesting Revocation</p>
<p>The Coal Industry Association sent a telegram to the central government yesterday: "Most Urgent, Central Party Headquarters, National Government, and Ministries of Industry and Railways, Jiaoji Railway issued a notice stating that coal freight prices will be increased by 20% for inland transport and set at 2.8 yuan for export, effective November 1. This contradicts the Ministry of Railways' telegram instructing to allocate as many vehicles as possible and revise special prices to benefit national coal. Japanese coal has been embargoed and needs to be replaced by national coal. This move by the railway is tantamount to suicide. Please instruct the railway to revoke the proposed decision and revise special prices and respond by telegram to reassure the people. Shanghai Coal Industry Association."</p>

<p>Two Japanese Wounded a Villager with a Gun</p>
<p>Japanese were shooting birds in Yinxiang Township; the birds flew in the sky, and the people stood on the ground. How could they wound a villager? The Public Security Bureau will lodge a strong protest.</p>
<p>Lu Jinfa, a resident of Yinxiang Township, was working in a cotton field in the east of Zhoujiawan at around 11:15 AM yesterday when two Japanese men, Yifuku Itta and Yoshioka Shiro, from the Gongda Spinning Mill, were shooting birds for fun nearby. With a loud bang, Lu Jinfa's left arm was suddenly wounded. Neighbors believed that Japanese people should not be firing guns carelessly at this time, especially since the birds were flying in the sky and the people were standing on the ground. It was clear daylight, yet Lu Jinfa was wounded. This was outrageous and showed extreme contempt for others. The crowd was seething with anger and was about to resort to force. Fortunately, police officers from the fourth precinct of the fifth district of the Public Security Bureau arrived, apprehended the two Japanese men, confiscated the weapons used in the attack, and escorted them to the police station. They will negotiate with the Japanese consulate. It was also discovered that the licenses for the shotguns used by the two Japanese men had long expired, which was also illegal.</p>
<p>Yunnan Lower-Ranking Officers Come to Shanghai to Join the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>There were two who came together. One of them, due to poverty and illness, attempted suicide to awaken the people. Fortunately, he was rescued by a sampan boatman.</p>
<p>During the Japanese military's invasion and occupation of our country's eastern provinces, patriotic youths have risen up to join the army in hopes of serving on the front lines and reclaiming the country's territory. Therefore, volunteer army organizations have sprung up in various places. Recently, two lower-ranking officers from Yunnan left their units and came to Shanghai to join the volunteer army as vanguards against the enemy. Unfortunately, one of them became seriously ill and, having exhausted his funds, attempted suicide by jumping into the river. Fortunately, he was rescued and did not join the river spirits. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Words of Grief 　　Cuckoo</p>
<p>Beloved countrymen. The United States has indeed taken its seat at the League of Nations. The bitter grief felt by the tyrannical Japanese, due to their unspeakable hidden agendas regarding this matter, is self-evident. However, we must not, because of the United States taking its seat at the League of Nations, think that they will help us and therefore slacken our work of resisting Japan and saving the nation. We must know that the reason the United States is taking a seat is solely for the sake of world peace, hoping to prevent China and Japan from resorting to arms and thus causing a world war, and not because they truly love our country. Therefore, regardless of whether the United States takes a seat at the League of Nations or not, we should steadily and practically do our own work, use our iron shoulders to bear the responsibility of saving the nation, use our iron fists to stop the flow of enemy goods, and when all else fails, even at the cost of iron and blood, recover every inch of our country's territory seized by the tyrannical Japanese.</p>

<h3>General Huo Who Frightened Away the Japanese Pirates</h3>
<p>Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>In Pinghu, Zhejiang, every year starting from the eighteenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, lanterns are hung for three days to commemorate the manifestation of the Han Dynasty General Huo Guang who frightened away the Japanese pirates.</p>
<p>This borders on superstition. However, at this time of violent Japanese aggression, with the authorities in the Northeast embracing a policy of non-resistance and losing important cities in succession, one cannot help but recall this myth in the hope of destroying the enemy. Therefore, I recount what I have heard to inform the readers.</p>
<p>Outside the east gate of Pinghu, there is the Great King Temple, which has been around for several centuries. The painted beams and carved pillars are magnificent. Inside, there are portraits of the Han Dynasty General Huo Guang and his wife. They are wearing red robes and gauze hats, sitting upright side by side. Legend has it that in the thirty-fourth year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates invaded the east, causing great suffering to the coastal provinces. One day, they advanced along Zha Pu and invaded Pinghu. When the news came, everyone was very frightened. The county magistrate gathered people from all walks of life to discuss strategies for resistance. Because the troops stationed inside and outside the city were very few, it was impossible to resist. As a result, it was decided that on the one hand, people would be sent to Jiaxing to request reinforcements to relieve the siege, and on the other hand, residents near the city outside the city would be temporarily evacuated into the city. The city gates were closed tightly to implement a strategy of strong walls and clearing the fields. On the evening of the eighteenth day of the fourth month, the Japanese pirates advanced to a point about a mile outside the east gate, and their faces showed panic. They abandoned their armor and dragged their weapons as they fled, even trampling each other to death in large numbers. The defenders of the city were puzzled. After they had gone far away, they opened the city gate to inspect and found corpses piled up along the roadside, and countless weapons were seized. As they entered the city, they suddenly saw a huge man on the city wall, glaring angrily. His appearance and clothing were exactly the same as the Great General Huo Guang enshrined in the Great King Temple. A short while later, when dawn broke, they entered the city to meet the county magistrate and reported what they had seen the previous night. Everyone believed that General Huo Guang was loyal to the Han Dynasty during his lifetime and hated foreigners after his death. Therefore, when the Japanese pirates came to invade, he sat high on the city wall to trấn 懾 (to intimidate). The Japanese pirates fled in a mass because they were intimidated by his awe-inspiring spirit. In addition to repairing the temple, it was also stipulated that this day would be commemorated as the day when General Huo Guang frightened away the Japanese pirates, and every household would hang lanterns to celebrate. This has been the custom for hundreds of years. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, I went to see the lanterns and saw...</p>
<p>A Small Chronicle of World Events</p>
<p>Crossing the English Channel</p>
<p>Between England and France is the English Channel. The narrowest part of the English Channel is about twenty miles, and the widest part is about one hundred miles. It is said that it is not easy to cross. In 1785, someone first crossed it in a hot air balloon. In 1875, a swimmer swam across it. In 1909, someone flew across it in an airplane. In 1930, someone crossed it in a flat-bottomed boat. This year, someone crossed it in a speedboat. This is even more difficult.</p>
<p>The Development of Aviation</p>
<p>The aviation industry in Europe is developing day by day. The cost of a light airplane is no more expensive than a car. Therefore, private individuals also own airplanes. As for airline companies that operate airplanes as a business, they are making huge profits. According to a recent survey, there are 29 airline companies in Europe, flying a total of 24,963,924 miles. France has the highest record, followed by Germany, Italy is third, and the Netherlands is fourth. England is only fifth.</p>
<p>Outside the city, in Hengjie Back Street, Temple Street, and even in the city's main street, Han River Bridge, etc., sky-high tents were erected, colorful pavilions were built on the bridge, and shops hung lanterns and colorful decorations, competing to be the most beautiful. Dozens of colorful platforms were tied in the streets, hanging in the air. The whole city was ecstatic. Incense smoke swirled in the Great King Temple. The wooden puppets of General Huo and his wife sat side by side in the main hall. Sacrificial dishes were placed on the table. All the residents inside and outside the city felt that he had manifested his divine power to frighten away the Japanese pirates and was blessed by him. They offered sacrifices to express their gratitude. Street signs stood upright on both sides, all with gold characters on a red background. One of them read "威懾島夷" (Intimidating the Island Barbarians), which indicated his achievement in frightening away the Japanese pirates. At this time, when various places in Liaoning and Jilin were successively occupied by Japan, thinking of this, how could one not be saddened? The pirates are deeply entrenched. The authorities are following old ways and delaying action, not knowing whether General Huo can manifest his divine power again. There is no way to think, hoping for divine blessing. Readers, please do not laugh at my superstition.</p>

<p>Ma Yinchu's Talk on Resisting Goods</p>
<p>Ma Yinchu, the Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan, is highly respected in academic and moral circles. Some time ago, I went to Hangzhou on business and met Mr. Ma in the car. At that time, Mr. Ma was holding a book and reading it attentively. He then told me that China's resistance to Japan could be achieved simply by severing economic ties, which would be enough to bring them to their doom. As he spoke, he showed me detailed statistics, which were divided into sugar, cotton yarn, paper, seafood, etc., estimating that the annual imports were no less than 260 million yuan. Mr. Ma also said that the drawback of resisting goods in the past was that it was not thorough enough. If we can make a firm determination this time, we can achieve great results. Mr. Ma does not like tea. I asked him about it, and he said that tea is a thing that easily stimulates the mind and should be avoided when reading. He also said that when he reads, he first looks at the general idea, selects the main parts to write down, and then studies them in detail. When the car arrived in Hangzhou, Mr. Ma's book had already filled more than a hundred pages.</p>

<p>A Bao's Voice in the Anti-Japanese Movement</p>
<p>A Bao, who works in the crab industry, has a heroic spirit that is no less than that of a generous and tragic singer of Yan and Zhao. He carries a basket and travels to and from Yangshupu Road in Shanghai. No one in the city knows him. One day, a Japanese person happened to pass by my school. Colleagues described how the Japanese pirates were spreading rumors and occupying our eastern provinces, leading their... bandits, shaking our borders, and even sending warships to spy on our halls. A Bao suddenly heard this and, with a shared hatred of the enemy, vowed to sacrifice himself to eliminate the ugly kind. He also said that he had fought with British policemen in the May 30th Massacre and still felt indignant about it. When asked about his situation, he said that his family was impoverished. He said, "The national crisis is such that I have no home to destroy, nor can I be burdened by my family. I vow to join your school's volunteer group and be a vanguard to kill the enemy." He immediately filled out a volunteer form. I especially recorded his words to warn those who are servile and cater to foreigners to tell those who come after.</p>
<p>Reminiscences of Floating Hill Autumn Flowers</p>
<p>Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Last autumn, I borrowed a house from Mr. He of Lanling. On a moonlit night, the empty room was silent. Several plants of white phoenix fairy in front of the steps stood tall and graceful. As a gentle breeze passed, they swayed gracefully. Peeking through the window, it was as if one saw a beautiful woman admiring her reflection, and I vaguely suspected that it was the soul of a beautiful woman leaving her body. At that time, I was still young and often indulged in reverie. I stayed up late and leaned against the railing, feeling the cold and beautiful fragrance, which was like annoying spring colors. I composed a five-character poem on the spot, which said: "The wind comes and the flowers worship the moon, the dew falls and the leaves conceive pearls." Those who saw it thought it was a beautiful sentence from a Song Dynasty poet.</p>
<p>A certain friend from Xiyou has a painting of autumn flowers, which was a collaboration between the famous painters Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting and several others. It is as beautiful and rare as a Sui pearl and He jade. Those who inscribed it include Zeng Nongran and Zhu Guwei and other elders. At that time, the old Jiangnan painter Wu Guandai was still alive. The host showed me the painting and pointed to a corner of the painting, saying that he would go to Wu to add an inscription and asked me to draft it first. He also said that the objects in the painting were morning glory, amaranth, and chrysanthemum, but the inscriptions by the various artists were general and too simple. Could I write a poem to describe the three objects separately?</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes on Passing Through Zhengzhou (Part 1)</p>
<p>Di Jianan</p>
<p>Since I have been serving in the cotton inspection office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, I have been specializing in the study of the grades of cotton in our country. Recently, I was ordered to go to Zhengzhou, Shaanxi, Lingbao and other places to collect cotton samples in person, with the assistance of the China Cotton Industry Trading Company. The company has branches in Zhengzhou and Shaanxi, which provide convenience for accommodation. Now I will record the travel situation in Zhengzhou in a haphazard manner.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 29th, I, together with Mr. Liu Mingyan, a staff member of the Zhengzhou branch of the China Cotton Industry Trading Company, took the 9:30 a.m. express train in Shanghai and arrived in Ning at 4:30 p.m. I went straight to the riverbank and saw that the area around Xiaguan was flooded by a huge amount of water. The thatched huts of the poor people only showed their roofs. The water on the ground was four or five feet deep in some places, and two or three feet in others. Pedestrians could only pass by relying on wooden rafts. The train to the riverbank also proceeded in the water. Thinking of the terrible floods in various parts of our country this time, I couldn't help but feel sad. Arriving at the riverbank, I took a small ferry across the river to Pukou and boarded the Jinpu Special Express train. The train ticket had to be purchased again because I had purchased a through train ticket from Shanghai to Zhengzhou. At 6:00 p.m., my elder brother Junwu, who paints and my younger cousin Lu Xiangsheng both came from Nanjing City.</p>
<p>He wore more clothes and prepared many letters of introduction to Zhengzhou, Shaanxi and other places. I carefully treasured them all. After talking for less than an hour, we shook hands and said goodbye. The train left at 7:00 p.m. We added tickets for sleeper cars, three yuan per person, and slept peacefully all night. The next morning, we arrived in Xuzhou. We got off the train and went up the Longhai train via the overpass. The train left at 8:00 a.m. After passing through Yangshan, Mamuji, Shangqiu, Liuhe, Lanfeng, Kaifeng, Zhongmou and other stations, I felt quite desolate as I looked around. The land was vast and sparsely populated. Occasionally there were large villages, which were scattered farmhouses. There were very few rivers and a lot of sandy land. There was also a lot of wasteland. I heard that central Henan has suffered from disasters and wars over the years, and bandits are everywhere, so the local area is very bitter. At 8:30 p.m., we finally arrived in Zhengzhou. It took a total of 36 hours to get here from Shanghai. After getting off the train, someone from the China Cotton Company came to pick us up, and we stayed in the China Cotton Zhengji Company in Fushou Street.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou is located in the center of Henan Province, with convenient transportation. The Beijing-Hankou and Longhai railways run vertically and horizontally through it. The traffic on the streets is mule carts and rickshaws. The prosperous streets are from the west gate of the county to the area around the station, with Datong Road being the most prosperous, followed by Fushou, Deji, and Xida streets. The city is quite desolate. Only Zhongshan Street is a bit lively. The customs are simple and old-fashioned. For example, young women do not go out easily, and the rules are strict. Even if you know someone, you cannot enter their home directly. You must first greet them at the door before you can enter. The staple food is noodles, and the houses are simple (except for shops). The entrances are not spacious. People are dressed in coarse cloth and are content with their lot. Even the most local people cannot be judged by their appearance. I heard that there are mule cart drivers who own assets of 200,000 yuan, but they still wear ragged clothes and are driven by others as before, which is very admirable. In the countryside, the walls of the houses are mostly made of mud. The villages are surrounded by earth walls. Some people live in mud caves, which are commonly called kiln households. The Xue Pinggui returning to the kiln in the opera is this. (To be continued).</p>
<p>I laughed and said, "It is a method of organization within the inch." Then I composed a quatrain: "The sight of the Heavenly Grandson leaving stirs up a hundred emotions. Let's share our sorrow and open in the face of the frost. The west wind cherishes the thin autumn face. Put on some red makeup to adorn it." Someone was very happy to get it, saying that in just twenty-eight words, it covered everything and there was nothing to regret.</p>
<p>Song Yu grieved over autumn, and poets share the same feeling. The feeling of twilight is the same throughout the ages. In the past, Dr. Guternow was famous in Shanghai for his youth rejuvenation technique. After all, it is not easy to overcome nature with human power and restore creation. It is unexpected that what is difficult for humans is possessed by plants, which is the old youth of autumn. Is it really as Zhuangzi said, "It is better to have no knowledge than to have knowledge?" The old youth is amaranth, which becomes more beautiful as it gets older, hence the name. We envy it and cannot but write a poem to praise it. The poem says: "Borrowing leaves to be flowers and competing for beauty, it is indeed a rich charm belonging to Xu Niang. Why must autumn beauty lose to spring colors? Good scenery should be viewed in the evening sun. Old man has been slow to get rich for half his life, and Wen Jun remarries is even more glorious. The same frost-covered quality in front of the steps is not as bleak as begonias.</p>
<p>Recording a Righteous Servant</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyan</p>
<p>My elder brother works in a certain bank in this port. One day, there was a great commotion in the bank. When I asked about it, I learned about the righteous servant of a certain colleague's family. When I returned home, I told it to me. I thought that although the matter was small, it was enough to influence the world, so I recorded it and made it public to everyone.</p>
<p>The colleague, Mr. So-and-so, is the son of a wealthy family. His father died, leaving behind a small amount of property, just enough to make ends meet. There was an old servant in the family, who had been employed by the family for more than ten years. Grieving over the loss of his master, one day he suddenly said to the young master, "Unfortunately, the master has passed away, leaving not much property. Young master should be diligent and thrifty in managing the family. I have followed the master for more than ten years and regard your family as my own. How can I bear to leave? However, if I stay here, your family will spend several taels of silver a month as a reward, which is not a way to be thrifty. However, if I don't accept it, I'm afraid the young master won't agree. For the sake of your family, I have to reluctantly leave." Mr. So-and-so was moved by his words and gave him some money to leave. Not long after, the family moved. After the servant left, he checked the money he had received and found that it was more than his due. He repeatedly wanted to return it, but he didn't know where his master was. A few days ago, he suddenly found out that Mr. So-and-so was working at this bank in this port, so he sent the remaining money. Mr. So-and-so was initially stunned and didn't know what was going on, because it had been five years since the matter. Alas, there are few people in the world who respect wealth and do not covet it. And those who wear tall hats and long gowns are even more prone to robbery. Those who wear short clothes and bare feet, who serve people all day long and have never heard of poetry and righteousness, can be ashamed of ill-gotten wealth and will not take even a mustard seed if it is not theirs. Is the meaning of taking and giving not clear until after reading? Although this servant is a slave in form, he is a gentleman in substance. How can all the people in the world be like this servant?</p>

<p>Knocking on the Dream Mortar (17)</p>
<p>Cheng Shanlu</p>
<p>He peeled off two more taroes to fill his stomach, and while eating, he chatted with the elder, "I have already experienced China in the past. What will China in the future be like? Old monk, please take me to the future world, please take me to China in the future, fifty years from now."</p>
<p>"Layman, I don't want you to see China in the future. I only want you to see China now." "Old monk, what's so good about China now? The more I look at it, the less happy I am." "Layman, don't worry. I'll show you China now next year, and I'll make sure you really "enjoy it here and don't miss Shu.""</p>
<p>"Is there really a paradise for us in this terrifying world? Old monk, I want to sit on your revolving chair again and try your time that doesn't flow."</p>
<p>So, Tao Chi sat on the revolving chair for the second time. After closing his eyes and concentrating for a while, when he opened his eyes, he was not sitting on the revolving chair, but with two good friends! One was Zhao Meiting, and the other was Qian Lanxuan, traveling together. They were walking on a very wide road, with big shops on both sides. Judging from the prosperous situation, it was similar to the trading ports of Shanghai and Tianjin, but it was not the trading ports of Shanghai and Tianjin.</p>
<p>At that time, it was the early dawn, and there were few pedestrians on the road. The big shops were not yet open. The three of them stepped on the sidewalk, which was as smooth as a whetstone, which was a great opportunity to walk and talk.</p>
<p>Tao Chi and his two friends were kindred spirits. Zhao Meiting was an architect, Qian Lanxuan was a thinker, and Tao Chi himself was a young man with military knowledge.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>What About the Kellogg-Briand Pact's Advice?</h3>
<p>On the 16th, the American representative, Gilbert, formally attended the League of Nations Administrative Council upon receiving instructions from his home government. From the Chairman of the Assembly, Briand, down, politicians and diplomats from various countries praised him greatly. The League of Nations, which had been shrouded in gloom and at a loss for a month, seemed to suddenly come alive with the formal participation of the Washington representative. People all over the world watched intently, holding their breath and waiting for the good news of upholding justice and maintaining peace to be broadcast from Geneva. This was because the League of Nations had reached the stage of genuine enforcement, and the fate of mankind was about to be decided within these few days.</p>
<p>According to today's telegraphic dispatch, the American representative, as a result of attending the secret meeting of twelve countries, advocated advising China and Japan to abide by Article II of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and cease actions that could undermine world peace. This was exactly the same as the resolution of the League of Nations' adjournment on September 30th. Rather than calling it a new resolution, it is more appropriate to say it is an old tune being replayed. On September 30th, the League of Nations Administrative Council advised Japan to withdraw its troops as soon as possible before October 14th. The Japanese representative, Yoshizawa, had already formally accepted this. However, extending to October 14th, the Japanese army occupied our Northeast as before, and their atrocities have only increased. Now, they are even resolutely stating that they will not withdraw their troops. The Japanese have already decisively trampled on the prestige of the League of Nations after September 30th. What is the point of the Kellogg-Briand Pact now? What is the point of restating the previous statement? The League of Nations Covenant has already been wounded. The Kellogg-Briand Pact is now following the same path and coming forth courageously. We truly do not know whether the Kellogg-Briand Pact has a "protective charm." Whether its pronouncements can truly restrain the tyrannical, causing the Japanese to bow their heads and accept its restraints. China has maintained world peace from beginning to end, thoroughly and completely, and has silently awaited the world's judgment on the Japanese violence, yielding from beginning to end. China has certainly not violated Article II of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, it is not necessary for the representatives attending the secret meeting to give a second sincere piece of advice. What China currently demands is the removal of the current oppression of violence, and the extension of the common justice of mankind. This is what all the people of China are desperately hoping for from the League of Nations, and this is what they are earnestly expecting from the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p>From the occurrence of the Japanese army's atrocities to today, it has been more than a month. Throughout this month, politicians and diplomats around the world have been racking their brains and exhausting their efforts. Today's secret meeting, tomorrow's outside contacts, speaking eloquently and arguing fiercely. However, the Japanese army has shown no regard for the anxieties and worries of the League of Nations' officials, and has not restrained their atrocities because of this, leaving no thread of dignity and prestige for the League of Nations. The sound of high-sounding arguments in the Geneva hall and the sound of Japanese planes dropping bombs in our Northeast echoed each other across the Eurasian continent. Did the officials of the League of Nations hear this echo? Did the representative of the Washington government hear this loud noise? If the Japanese continue to implement their tough measures from beginning to end and disregard the second piece of advice, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact is ultimately unable to stop their atrocities, we do not know whether the officials of the League of Nations have prepared to bring out the third magical charm of the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>Since September 18th, the atrocities committed by the Japanese against China have been heard by all countries in the world and seen by all. The fact that these atrocities are sufficient to endanger the world and endanger all of mankind should also be commonly understood by people around the world. Therefore, in today's events, who is right and who is wrong, who is the culprit in undermining peace, who is the public enemy of all mankind, and how to restrain and how to make the criminals bear their responsibility? As long as the international covenant countries have the determination to maintain the covenant, uphold justice, and safeguard peace, the resolution of the above-mentioned problems is not difficult. If not, what is the benefit of anxiety? What is the benefit of meetings? What is the benefit of advice?</p>
<p>The international community is like a large stage, and the figures active in the politics of each country are the actors in the drama. This metaphor, confirmed by today's events, we cannot but regard as accurate. Today, the League of Nations gathers politicians and diplomats from fourteen countries in one hall, and what they are staging is nothing more than a slapstick comedy. The participation of the American representative makes this comedy even more farcical. However, we firmly believe that the end of this slapstick comedy will be the beginning of an unparalleled tragedy. China is undoubtedly the protagonist in the future tragedy. However, can all countries in the world transcend the grand stage of tragic performance? Will they not bring all of mankind to ruin together? Have all countries in the world already made this decision? We sincerely and uniformly pray that the final catastrophe will not come soon.</p>
