<h3 id="c16">最近之外交問題 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>吾國人今日最大之希望。一方爲肅清匪禍。以安定民生。一方爲實行廢除不平等條約。以增進國際地位。然所謂廢除不平等條約。不過欲收回我國應有之權利。非分外有所希冀也。故仍本此和平誠懇之意。以與各國進行親善之外交。而各國中欲保持其所得不合法之權利者。則每不能相諒。遇事輒加阻難。如今日所得關於日俄兩國之消息。則不能無遺憾焉。駐遼日總領近以華人排日壓迫韓民等問題。向東北當局提出抗議。夫彼所謂壓迫韓民云者。即指長春萬寳山一案言之也。萬寳山案之起。因有大帮韓民。强挖民田。導引伊通河水。以謀發展其稻田公司之利益。而在我方農民。則以如果挖成。非特毁壤良田不少。且將來一值大水。附近二千餘垧之民田。勢將悉受其害。故由地方當局請令制止。乃韓民强挖如故。并派警察臨塲保護。此種事實。詳載報紙。我人方冀日總領公平處理。有以四預地方之惡感。乃不謂竟視爲壓迫韓民。認我民有排日之意。此則大可驚異者也。又如此次中俄會議。我人亦冀有以消除兩國間之隔閡。復交通商之成功。乃不謂贖路問題之會議未終。俄方忽又另提改易中東路制度及變更管理規則案。主張將監理會一併裁撤。表面爲因營業蕭條而減政。實則不外乎擴張俄局長管理之威權。使東路一切。盡歸其操縱。從可知此次議會。非眞有與我親善之意。不勝令人遺憾者矣。</p>

<p>英下院通過地稅修正案</p>

<p>路透社十五日倫敦電　保守黨對於財政大臣史諾登所擬財政案中之地稅計畫、今日在下院提出修改案、主張農地免稅、此修正案以二三二票對二○八票通過、報告結果後、有人大呼「辭職」、首相答保守黨領袖包爾温之問、謂此修正案之性質、無關重要、各事照常進行云、保守黨繼又提出較爲嚴重之修正案、但此次政府議員出席者多、故提案打銷、夜半内閣開緊急會議、討論自由黨所擬提出代替地稅修正案之辦法、衆料政潮可望平息、</p>

<p>乙高中</p>
<p>一、二三年級英語鐘點應酌量增加、理由、普通科爲升學之準備對於文字工具、應有充分時間打好基礎、所訂作業要項、誠不可少、然因作業要項、所包甚廣、文法與修辭、又不另訂鐘點、則每週四小時、合計不過二百分鐘、欲求面面顧到、且能熟練實不可能、辦法、二三年級英語、改爲每週五小時、二、算學分量宜减少、理由、高中學生興趣不同、有性近於算學者、有性不近於算學者、如强使不同、未免抹煞個性、辦法、解析幾何、改爲選修初中三角、旣不列入必修、（理由見前）則高中三角宜改爲四學分、幾何如將重複部分刪去、（理由見關於敎材及敎學方面之意見）有四學分即足、三、本國史學分可减少、理由、學生在初中畢業、對於本國史、已有相當之基礎、故高中本國史學習進度甚速、依過去一年試騐之經騐、每週兩小時一年可授畢、辦法、本國史改爲四學分、四、生物學學分可减少、理由、生物學敎材固甚龐雜、然用代表法、同時顧及敎學、經濟則無須、每週五小時根據過去兩年之經騐、每週四小時一年可授畢、辦法、生物學改爲四學分、（一）茲根據上列意見將高中普通科科目及學分列表如左、</p>

<p>（二）　關於敎材及敎學方面</p>
<p>甲　初中</p>
<p>一、三年級英語文法應與讀本分敎、理由、讀本與文法合敎因屬最新原理、然根據經騐所得、此種辦法、適宜於初學時期、而不適宜於高年級、因至高年級時、應漸注重系統方面、學生亦有此要求不滿意於片碎零亂之知識、故混合敎學、在高年級鮮有能收效者、再從敎本方面而睔、現今坊間所編敎科書、僅於每篇之末加以少許文法上之說明、結果反使學生對於文法知識、模糊不清、辦法、初中三年級每週應有二小時、專授英語文法敎學時、自應隨時與讀本聯絡、二、初中歷史敎材應採用逆叙法、理由、歷史敎材依時代爲經循序、講述固足以得確實之時間、觀念明瞭、入羣進化之跡象、但古代史實與人生關係、相離太遠、初學易感枯燥、因興趣索然、難期自動研究之實現、若由近及遠、取某一問題、作探本窮源之討論、不第能了解史跡演進之由來、更足以養成敏銳之觀察力思考力與推理力、辦法、依敎材大綱循序倒列之先現代、次近世中古而上古、如講本國民族、先闡明中華民族搆成之原素、及在世界上之地位、次及各民族之接觸消長與同化、再次民族之由來等、三、初中地理敎材應先列自然區劃與政治區劃之大綱、理由、講本國地理採分省法、（或分區法）外國地理採分國法、固屬呆板、而不切實用、但通用之地圖及各種統計材料、來源、在在不能打破分省及分國之舊觀念、且於解釋一地方之位置、欲其明瞭確實、亦非有區域的說明不可、是自然區劃或政治區劃之應用、實與經緯度同屬必要、故宜首列簡單之叙述、以明一切人地關係之綱領、辦法、於敎材大綱項内添列區域之簡單說明、並略述分區之沿革自然區域與政治區域之比較等、以作叙述自然現象及人文現象之基礎、</p>
<p>乙高中</p>
<p>一、英語文法應與讀本分敎、理由、詳甲項初中第一條、辦法、一二年級應有一小時或二小時、專敎文法敎學時自應隨時與讀本聯絡、二、高中代數及幾何應將與初等代數及初等幾何重複部分刪去、理由、時間不經濟防碍高深部分、辦法、仿普通高等代數編法開始時、臚列初等代數或初等幾何公式及定理、不加說明及證明、以供引用、三、高中三角敎材應再求充實、理由、初中三角敎材甚簡略、或竟無三角學程、將來欲入大學理工科、似嫌不足、辦法、後半部應增加三角方程式及其他高深部分、四、高中解析幾何應增加立體解析幾何大意、理由、初中僅有初等平面幾何高中、略有初等立體幾何學生、對於立體觀念、似嫌薄弱、將來研究高深數理及繪製機械圖、頗有障碍、故有再用解析方法、複習立體幾何之必要、辦法、在平面解析幾何之後、增加一章或二章立體解析幾何大意、五、高中地理學程應增加自然敎材、理由、地理敎材固注重人文方面、但自然環境爲人文現象之基礎、似亦不可忽略、初中敎材之關於自然方面者、過於簡單、不足供問題研究之依據、且自然科學有頼於地理說明者至夥、自應於本學程有充分之準備、辦法、於本國部分及外國部分敎材大綱項内各增加關於自然地理之問題若干則、約佔全敎材百分之二十或三十、</p>
<p>（三）　關於分組方面</p>
<p>普通科仍宜分文理兩組、理由、課程應顧及學生之興趣、此乃課程編製原則之一、事實上高中學生興趣、有近於文者、有近於理者、强使之同、似有未當、而敎者學者、雙方均感困難、亦非所宜、若謂民國十二年全國敎育聯合會所訂之新學制課程標準有欠當之處、僅可於選科方面、矯正其弊瑞、而分組之原則、不必打破、若謂採用訓練主義、是否適宜、尙是問題、辦法、一年級不分組、自二年級起、仍分文理兩組、選修科目加以限制、並組成有系統之排列、以免一般選科流弊、</p>
<p>（四）　關於大學中銜接方面</p>
<p>大學入學試騐應根據中學課程極準、理由、中學入學試騐標準應與小學畢業程度銜接大學入學試騐標準、亦應與中學畢業程度銜接、如是方可免隔閡之弊、但事實上大學入學試騐、只從大學本身方面着想、任意提高程度、且各大學所訂之標準、亦不一致、即以中央大學理學院入學試騐題與交通大學人學試題而論、兩相比較、程度頗有懸殊、此種紛亂現象、實足以使中學感覺困難、今旣有部頒中學課程標準、則大學應一致、以此爲根據、辦法、由敎育部通令各大學以後入學試騐、應依據部頒中學課程標準、以資銜接、</p>

<p>談最近時局</p>
<p>上海市長張岳軍、前因代表中央、慰問張副司令病狀北上、業於十四日返京復命、昨晨張氏返滬、新聲社記者特訪之於市府、叩粵局及北方情形等問題、據其談話如下、</p>
<p>副司令病　張副司令在北返時、即感到身體不適、旋見增加、初僅由副座隨帶之醫生診治、至上月三十日、始遷入醫院、温度最高時爲三十九度、至余十二日離平時、温度已與常人相同、神志亦甚清晰、惟因元氣未復、尙須調治、大約再過一星期或可出院、但將來出院後、或回瀋陽休養、或另擇清幽地方、現尙未定、總之、副司令之病、自始至今、并未有何危險也、</p>
<p>北方情形　至北方自張副司令病後、一切行政治安、均由各長官負責維持、故平津一帶、異常安寗、同時對於蔣主席所發麻電、張副司令以下、均表示絶對擁護、外間種種謡傳、如某系如何活動、石友三之部隊有異趨等、均屬不確、最近東北軍隊調動、完全爲擁護中央、防範地方之舉、外間流言、實係無稽猜測之談、張副司令對於中央極端服從擁護、</p>
<p>粵局近况　關於粵局問題、余在京晤張溥泉先生時、據談、在粵時、曾與粵方各要人會見、據各人所表示者、多數均主張用政治方式解决、至於在中央方面、實始終未曾表示對粵用兵、及何種軍事行動、而極端主張和平解决、現中央對粵事仍以勸導爲主、將來或能於政治方式上另得一途徑解决之、</p>
<p>勦匪問題　中央對於勦滅赤匪、具有决心、以除大患、同時於軍事上政治上以及財政等、均有充裕之準備、四川方面亦已抽調軍隊協助中央勦匪、蔣總司令大約日内可以出發、按照預定之動匪計劃進行、共匪雖極猖獗、或不難一鼓殲滅</p>
<p>市府改組　張市長又續談市府改組問題、據謂、自國府公布市府新組織法後、本市之組織細則、業已呈由行政院核准、定於七月一日起實行、將來改組後、對於市府各科及人員等、并無何種更動、</p>
<p>職員調動　又謂、市府參事奚定謨、自交通部任命爲滬上航政局長後、業於今日（十六）下午、來市政府辭職、本人已予許可、其遺缺即由市府秘書周良才遞補矣、</p>

<p>實部進行　實業部工商訪問局曾派員向工部局總辦費信惇交涉、結果、允許商塲復業、惟復業後、游藝部内設備須加改良、後因商塲不願自動開門、昨日已將交涉經過、電部報告、並於外交部駐滬辦事處科長趙鐵章協商、準備日内會同市府市商會市黨部社會局等機關代表、討論辦法、以便在可能範圍内解决之云、</p>
<p>市府交涉　市政府秘書長俞鴻鈞函工部局總裁費信惇、嚴重抗議、茲將原函覓錄如下、逕啓者、昨據中華國產聯合大商塲呈稱、公共租界捕房、於六月九日下午三時、突派中西巡捕多人、武裝蒞塲、將全部大門、一律封閉、勒令停業、屬永安成例、於樓上添設遊藝部、以期營業發達、詎工部局以遊藝部領照問題、留難備至、其後與房主已訂七年之約、豈知請照裝修、而工部局竟以該處房屋、不合辦理商塲爲辭、拒不發照、不得已於五月五日、遷於靜安寺路四號、以爲新世界本屬遊藝之場、一切設備、當與局章相合、或不致再有異議、抑知旣遷以後、刁難如故、不然、何以同一遊藝塲、而在商塲未遷以先、新世界辦理之時、未聞此命、然屬塲旣處租界、祇得惟命是從、悉行遵辦、不謂六月九日、復有封鎖全塲勒令停業、之舉、所藉口者、不過照會問題、但商塲旣無領照必要、更無違章可言、何以亦遭一律封閉、而商塲職員、亦被巡捕非法毆打受傷、逮捕拘押、所有被傷之人、業經呈報特區法院騐明傷處在案、懇請設法交涉等情、據此、復經社會局調查此事始末、報告前來、略同前情、查貴工部局因該塲附設之遊藝部領照問題、遽將該塲全部、勒令停業、且加以封閉、殊難索解、且事前並未請求法院許可、遂貿然執行封閉、尤爲根本之錯誤、此種措施、不獨妨害我國法權、且違背關於上海公共租界中國法院之協定、若不亟予糾正、將使特區居民、均感有不得享受法律保障之虞、萬一發生誤會、誰負其責、據呈前情、除關於該塲所受損失、應由該塲直接依法請求救濟外、相應嚴重抗議、請煩查照見復爲荷、此致上海公共租界工部局總裁費信惇、</p>

<p>華商運會被洋商擊破</p>
<p>運貨水脚費飛增兩倍</p>
<p>近一月來、川河航輪、因外商謀壟斷航業、華輪聯合同盟、雙方各竭全力進行、引起航運界重大風波、此事已兩記本報、詎事變之來、有出人意外者、在華輪方始同盟團結、與商帮工團合作告成之初、未及一週、驟起巨變、八華輪局與工商界之聯合團體、業被洋商設法打破、因而激生增漲水脚、華商罷運之大風潮、此事關係川河航權之存亡問題、記者特赴各方面詳加調查如下、</p>
<p>打破華輪聯合　川河華商輪船招商·三北·中興·蜀平·渝江·永慶·及川江·等八家、在上月内、曾聯合客帮報關駁船打包機器等八個團體、組織一商運聯合會、主張以國貨運國輪、拒裝外船、於六月一日正式成立、此事爲外商得悉、急謀破壞、以宜昌不能運動、而至重慶、昨日消息傳來、重慶商運聯合會、竟受外人運動、容許洋商輪船加入公會、自六月六號以後、將此各華輪慘淡經營之公會、完全被外人打破、已經將會名改爲華洋商運聯合會矣、而華人收回川河航權之主張、至是亦根本破裂、</p>
<p>洋商飛漲水脚　洋商旣設計取得川河運輸權利後、即於六月六號、召集在會之中國八輪局、及工商八轉體會議、謂現在宜渝一路、貨少船多、上下水脚、歷次减跌、已至最小限度、棉紗一件、祇收二兩、殊不敷各輪成本、提出增漲水脚案、每棉紗一件、自六號起、漲收六兩、較現率增加兩倍、</p>
<p>外輪反對减班　在會各華輪代表、亦提出要求、以現當上下缺貨之際、川河内有三十餘輪行駛、華商祇八艘、餘均外輪、爲維持匀勢計、應實行减班、每一輪公司、不得過兩船、詎料該項辦法、爲各洋商所反對、（因每一外輪公司有六七船八九輪不等）不允减少船隻、祇許限定各船裝量每輪每次僅許裝半數貨件、如有私自多裝、查出重罰、且不許私行跌價、如查出棉紗水脚私跌六元以内者、扣停輪運一個月、此辦法實行、華輪已入絶境矣、</p>
<p>商帮罷運抵制　自此次華洋商運聯合會議、决定辦法公布後、川中各商帮、咸皆大驚、以照此辦理、則川河中國船、祇占外輪四分之一、而受其限制之束縛、已陷絶地、此後川中航業、已完全入外輪操縱中矣、將來水脚必更漲不已、甫經取得運輸權、已增水脚兩倍、將來川帮痛苦、不知伊於何底、遂一致議定、相率罷運停裝、以求挽救、本埠三北公司得此警耗、亦急電重慶、令將當陽輪停班回滬、招商局峨嵋、亦輟航不行、再定辦法矣、</p>

<p>海昌經理毓大公司輪毓大號、撞沉英潛艇柏斯登號、已迭誌本報、昨日該公司毓濟輪、由營口來滬、據該輪負責人員言、此次毓大輪之撞沉英艦、其責任純在英潛艇、因其行駛航道錯誤故也、蓋毓大於九日午刻、到成山角時、依準航道而行、而英艦柏斯登號、則於側面駛來、並非從海底冒起、與毓大相撞、當毓大依綫前</p>

<p>第四張</p>
<p>進、瞥見英艦時、曾拉回聲、照例互相避讓、可無危險、詎艦輪相近之時、續大輪急向外擋退讓、而英艦忽地轉變方向、艦體突然横越毓大而過、使毓大避無可避、讓無可讓、而續大船首、乃猛撞入英潛艦腰部、致遭失事、沉沒後、艦長等六人、爲毓大救起、即同赴威海衛海關、報告相撞經過、毓大船長承認撞艦、並簽字證實、而柏斯登艦長、亦在關上承認行錯航道、遂致相撞、表示責在本艦、與毓大無涉、亦簽字負責、今毓大輪已由營口開來、本日可到上海、停在楊家渡招商碼頭、而英潛艇下沉之處、現有九隻英艦、在該處海面搜查死屍、並謀打撈方法云、</p>

<h3 id="c97">人的買賣 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>以人而爲貨物。從事買賣。凡業是者。其性之殘酷。亦不言可知矣。昔年美洲方面有黑奴之買賣。營此業者獲利頗厚。待林肯解放黑奴。南北戰爭解决而後。販賣黑奴之人。不復聞矣。且將所有共和國。我人以爲從此黑奴不再爲人販賣。不料非洲方面。近來畜奴制復興。黑奴之買賣又大盛矣。</p>
<p>然回顧中國方面。雖無販賣人口之機關。而賣人之業。亦頗發達。一如非洲無異。業此者亦大不乏人。其中大都爲地痞流氓。無以爲生者。乃從事拐騙童男少女。設法販賣。據云蘇州一帶之少女。最受新加坡華僑之歡迎。一般騙子。拐得少女。咸運往新加坡販賣。獲利之厚。實爲罕見。蓋新加坡方面。有秘密拍賣少女之市塲。營業頗爲發達。故運往之年輕少女。實有供不應求之槪也。</p>
<p>新加坡一地爲東西交通所必經之處。市况頗爲發達。而社會又頗複雜。故黑幕之多。爲各處所無。西人每名之爲黑暗市塲。即因此也。除少女拍賣塲而外。尙有販賣兒童公司之秘密設立。業此者之交際手段。頗爲靈活。與當地富人。均有來往。故所有兒童。均可設法銷售。至兒童之來源。則大半亦由騙子拐來。此外貧苦之人。無力贍養兒女。亦每將兒女託公司銷售。</p>
<p>我鄕有業此販賣人口者。每名之曰「白螞蟻」「販人頭。」其中亦大都爲無業遊民。意志不定之少女。時或爲若輩所誘惑而販賣。他如一般孀婦。或自動請販人者設法。或爲翁姑所逼嫁。由販人者人爲承銷。從中圖利。尤見繁多。惟被賣之人。大抵以少女爲多。俾可由人納爲妻妾。此中慘事。時有發生。亦人類之不幸也。</p>

<p>— 李碧厓</p>
<p>崑山嘉定接攘處。有石梁。稱大通橋。其地因以大通橋名。橋畔有古集賢庵。毁太半。泥菩蕯不蔽風雨。里人欲興建之。以存古蹟。苦於乏財。則亦已耳。詎知今有意外之財。源源而來。不久可達重建古集賢庵之目的者。說來甚怪異。不免涉迷信。顧此爲余目擊。非得自傳聞者。可爲喜閲自由談者一述焉。古集賢庵山門前。有古銀杏二株。東西並列。大可五六抱。父老相傳。謂是千年老樹也。上月。西一樹忽遭火災。蓋樹已中空。火從中空處飛出。近處有防隊。奮勇來救。越五六小時始熄。火飛出處。折一大枝。長數丈。大且合抱。究其發火之由。衆論不一。或云有一僧。以焚餘之香。投入樹根空洞内。或云過客休息。倚樹根而坐。殘餘香烟。遣於根洞。洞中積有敗葉。遂起燃燒。後一說係偶然事。不足怪。前一說。似有作用。今之信前一說者。百人而九十餘矣。蓋古銀杏災後數日。忽有人自南翔眞茹一帶來。爭剝被災古銀古之樹皮。云有人傳說。此爲靈異仙丹。可療百病。越日。來者愈衆。地方上人。防古樹之不焦於火。而死於剝皮也。遂以竹離圍之。又以來求仙丹者之哀告乞取也。乃將折下一大枝。分析而給與來者。又越一二日。來者益衆。地方上人謂乘此時機。可興建古集賢庵。以存古蹟矣。於是黃簿子立。而助願者紛紛。大有臣門如市之槪况。聞自立黃簿。已更三冊。現繳約已積銀二三百元。其助願而未來繳者。亦有此數。又有富室願助筒瓦數百。墙磚數萬者。踴躍輸將。咸謂雖取古銀杏之葉一二片煎服之。病立愈。故來繳願迅速也。余初不之信。偕友往觀。爲之咋舌稱異。友謂余曰。古銀杏抱救世心。甘自犠牲。以免病者之痛苦。可感也。余應之曰。我民衆痛苦多矣。有能犠牲一己而拯救之者。誰不願焚香而頂禮之。惜乎有救世心者。無類似古銀杏偉大之力。有類似古銀古偉大之力者。無救世心耳。我民衆又從何處去乞取仙丹耶。</p>

<p>盧橘微黃尙帶酸。此蘇長公之詩也。廬橘。爲枇杷之别名。羣芳譜。謂枇把秋萌冬花。春實夏熟。備四時之氣。他果無與類者。洵珍果已。當茲炎天。枇杷翠籠手香。偶述爲文。不覺　涎之下滴也</p>
<p>相傳秀水竹垞居士。與某羽士相友善。觀中有枇杷二株。熱時每見續。均無核者竹垞詢其故。羽士以仙種對。竹垞終不信。知羽士嗜蒸豚。一日邀之來。命傭市一彘肩。故今羽士見。不逾晷。即出以佐餐。透熟腴美。羽士爲之飽啖。因問竹垞速化之法。竹垞曰。偶有小術。欲以易枇杷種耳。羽士低語曰。無他。於始花時。鑷去其中心一鬚耳。竹垞曰。然則吾之饌亦無他。昨所預烹者耳。相與撫掌。按枇杷無核者。名焦子。出廣州。見廣志。</p>
<p>曩李秀山幕府中。有秘書某。眷一眉史曰紅枇杷。眉史善彈琵琶。嗜啖枇杷。因以噪其名也。甘製有琵琶泣影詞。爲紅枇杷寫身世。極哀感頑艷之致。一時傳誦焉</p>
<p>枇杷葉大如驢耳。粵人稱之爲無憂扇。煎飲之可治咳病。但背有黃毛茸茸然。宜刷去之。否則不但無益。且加害也。故病家往往購現成之枇杷葉露以代之。</p>
<p>我蘇洞庭山。素以產枇杷著。有紅沙白沙之别。白沙者爲佳。更有實小而帶扁形者。曰荸薺種。尤爲上品。</p>
<p>滿天風露枇杷熟。歸奉慈親取次嘗。此陳基之句也。讀之不覺油然而起孝思。其他尙有白居易詩。淮山側畔楚江陰。五月枇杷正滿林。又陸游詩。枝頭不怕風摇落。樹上惟憂鳥啄殘。皆足爲批杷生色。</p>
<p>枇杷。核種即出。待長移栽。春三月以他木本接之。壅之以灰。技葉婆娑。凌霜不凋。故有枇杷晚翠之稱。</p>
<p>枇杷凍。爲一種清雋之食品。法以去皮核之枇杷。切成薄片。加適量之水。文火煑之。以軟爛爲度。瀝取其汁。和入糖霜。置於蜜餞罐中。先煑數分鐘。調之使融。再加熱至沸。傾諸於琉璃之盎。密封而投置冷水。約半小時。即明瑩成凍矣。</p>

<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>吾國社會。有展覽會這個名詞。不過十五年的歷史。以前只有賽曾這個名詞。最先從民衆方面演成。像我們研究藝術的人。常常舉行展覽會。最近的十年中。有過國際的。集團的。私人的種種的藝術運動。至少喚起了社會有展覽會名稱的槪念。在十八年春。上海曾開過一次全國美術展覽會。是敎育部主辦的。而最近在首都開幕的第一届美術展覽會。更值得我們的注意。因爲開會的地點。是在首都。（國家舉辦的展覽會。在首都舉行）。我對於首都爲提高文化事業而主辦美術展覽會。先有兩點意義。要申述的。凡公共關於文化運動的展覽會。尤其是國家敎育機關主辦的會。要有永久的組織。决不是偶然間開一次便過去了。必須每年要在規定的時間内舉行。如果想着就開。沒有經費或怕麻煩就停。其效極微。有第一屆必。有第二届。乃至於無窮。　由第一届的簡陋而漸次完善。由第一届作品的粗劣。而漸次精良。這都要在嚴密的辦理上去糾正的。這是我所希望者一。</p>
<p>凡國家敎育機關舉辦的展覽會。有了審查。必須有獎勵。民衆藝術的提高與各作家的努力。全在政府機關有相當的獎勵。規定給獎辦法以後。其出品的優秀。便會年年增長。一方面使各作家埋頭努力。一方面就是國家產生藝術的精華。這是我所希望者二。</p>
<p>關於上述的兩點布望之外。從這次的展覽會而推想到國民政府奠都南京後更感需要的。便是籌備首都美術館的運動。並盼大家都做美術館運動的後援。爲中華民族增光榮。爲數千年我國文化的發揚光大。爲革命成功後的首都做文化的領袖。爲新興首都的觀瞻。不得不有美術館的組織。我旅歐各國所看到的。莫說都會有美術館及博物館的設備。即一小城也有小規模的點綴。去年冬天我從歐洲回國。感得有组織美術館的必要。在滬市會與李石曾蔡子民諸先生商酌。得李先生同意。先在上海設立美術陳列館。現時正在建築。兩月以後。便可完成。但是想到南京設立美術館。比上海尤爲必要。因爲首都是全國的中心。觀瞻所在。尤其是一國的文化標幟。都要在藝術上尋味。現在有外人踏我土地。到我首都。若問美術館所在。吾人無以應對。誠爲憾事。故吾人不得不有組織美術館之運動。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>他說到這裏。肩膀聳了一聳。眼角上的魚尾紋。一齊活動起來。表示他那一分得意。接着道。「你說吧。頭二三等。那家不能去。去了挑上一個姑娘。就是班子吧。喝香片茶。烟捲。足抽足喝。給錢人家不敢要呢。那頭等班子裏的小姑娘。你們也在路上瞧過。他正眼兒瞧你一瞧嗎。可是你一當了大兵。他就得伺候你。當兵的好處。眞說不盡啦。你别說怕打仗。不打仗。當兵的往那兒去找出頭年。你們沒聽見說嗎。劉備是賣草鞋。張飛是賣肉的。關神爺還趕過大車啦。他們後來弄得哥爲君來弟爲臣。不都是打仗打出來的嗎。薛仁貴封到平遼王。聽過戲的準知道。他不是大花子去投軍嗎。好漢不怕出身低。就瞧你怎麽幹。我們的師長。他就是當弟兄出身。現在什麽威風。大洋樓。汽車。姨太太。你說那一樣沒有不打仗。那裏去搶功。男子漢大丈夫。怕什麽死。人從出世的那一天。閻王爺就先定下壽數。該活死不了。該死活不了。古言道得好。在刦的難逃。江山總是打出來的。老等着包角子（角讀作餕）往嘴裏跑。沒那回事。你們想個出頭年。要想出頭年。就跟我當兵去。準沒有錯。著是作小買賣的。作一輩子小買賣。拉車的。拉一輩子洋車。花花世界。什麽沒有分。那算白來一趟。我的話說完了。你們有幹的沒有。」這句話說完。早有兩個人從人叢走出來道。「老總。我幹。」那兵笑道。「得你算事的。還有誰。」說着。他對人叢中用目光如掃射機關槍一般。射到了張小三兒身上張小三兒道。「得。我也去。」說着。他走到那大兵面前。將兩手搓了一搓。頭左右望着。現出那不知如何是好的樣子來。那兵道。「你先和他們坐在一處。待一會兒咱們一塊兒走。」於是張小三兒加入了那低頭聽演說的幾人之中。那兵笑嘻嘻的繼續着演講。他心裏的樂處。沒有别人知道。因爲假如人人是這樣踴躍投軍。他不難半天招一排入。這着他營裏的規矩。他至少可以作一個排長了。</p>

<p>將出版單行本</p>
<p>谷劍塵先生新編的三幕劇「狂風暴雨」、聽說已經在無錫敎育學院排演過了、我們在本月十九日申報上、看見天牛君的「把狂風暴雨供獻給現代劇壇」的一篇文字、知道這劇本的内容是描寫中日兩民族間的衝突、而以滿蒙爲背景、由朝鮮女子作爲全劇的主線、劇中少年楊志清集合同志、實行開懇滿蒙計劃、被日人所破壞、地圖計畫書等均被失去、楊志清遭了不白之冤、不但爲民衆所唾棄、而他的未婚妻也與他撤銷婚約了、外頭的謡言指他係受日人利誘、於是得了賣國賊的頭銜、他沒處部白、便攖心疾、幸而自以爲是日本女子的小野梅子、知道自己實在是朝鮮的姑娘、因此自承於中國人面前、重把盜去的地圖和計畫書拿回來、但可憐的少年楊志清、已經得了瘋癲病自殺了、後來朝鮮姑娘也死在日本人手裏、我們看到這樣的劇情、是何等的動人呢、我們很希望這劇本早日發表以快先覩、並且、在這學校劇運動風起雲湧一般都閙着劇本荒的時候、這樣的劇本在表演方面很值得採用的現在聽說谷先生將原稿寄給前鋒周報社、該社即將前鋒周報四十五六七八等期上刋登、並且將這幾期的周報、合印成單行本、將谷先生的劇本完全刋登出來、等於「狂風暴雨」的單行本、日内即將出版、總發行所西門方斜路大光書店、</p>
<h3 id="c121">觀鈴木氏油畫展後 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 陳抱一</p>
<p>數日前（五月二十九、三十兩天）開於日本人俱樂部的「鈴木良三氏油畫展」、也是最近開過的日本洋畫家展中的優秀之一、</p>
<p>鈴木良三氏、他的名字我以前也曾聽見過、惟對於作品、則這一次算是第一次看見、</p>
<p>所陳列的作品、共五十餘點、大部分是風景、是這次來中國旅行寫生的收獲品、此外有人像數點、</p>
<p>作品之中、佳作不少、……其作風、是一種不落於甜俗的寫實……雖漂着織細柔和的諧調、然有着健實而明滐的表現、……畫面、用角沈着、有一種、是籠着銀灰色的諧調、……有一種部分、是於明淡的Ｍass（色調的塊量）中、參着輕柔織麗的線描、……這是應其表現、而巧妙地使用的線條、</p>
<p>至於作品、則除了似屬作者底得意作的……「柳樹之蔭」、「少女」、「平湖秋月」（其一）、「湖畔小景」等而外、尙有許多幅屬爲佳作的、若略而舉之、則例如丨</p>
<p>描寫湖面一部分的「西湖遊覽船」（約三號大的Ｓketch）……湖面沈暗作鉛色、有白蓬的遊艇泛流於柔漣之間、是一幅沈着的、可愛的小品、</p>
<p>「西湖春雨」（二十五號大的）、是幅由高度描寫的畫面、前景左側、有白色屋牆之一部、前面及山下的老木雜樹、用柔和而沈着的明綠、暗綠所描、湖水、天空、與全部的諧調、濛濛地漂着明淡的銀灰色、</p>
<p>「午後之睴映」、是一幅描着澄明而暗綠的水面、與沈着的暖色所描的前景樓閣樹木、美麗地調和着的畫面、……於並不鮮明的色彩裏、令人爽快地感到映浴着全體景色的、午後陽光之暄妍、</p>
<p>「平湖秋月」（其二）（約三十號大的畫）、……這是以建築爲主題的、是用沈黯的色彩所描、而很能表出我國古式建築之美趣、就其描法而言、亦見表現得極其精當、而且寫實、却为落於瑣碎、</p>
<p>大幅的「池畔之屋」、是描寫一部分屋宇長廊及樹木爲主體的、（廊蔭間立有紅藍服之二女人）、蔭光柔和地交錯於全畫面、而色、鮮麗之中却帶沈實、把初夏的情趣美麗地表出、</p>
<p>「天平山初夏」、（大幅的）……林木山景、色彩調和、尤其遠景高山、那種嶙峋的山石、以帶赭的淡紫色、及淡綠色、輕淡地表出、</p>
<p>「初夏小徑」、也是一幅很能表出初夏園林情趣的畫、筆致輕快而明滐、遠近的樹色、屋墙、及蔭間石路、作出美緻的諧調、</p>
<p>「留園」、是描着沈暗的、褐綠色的池水、有斜伸水面的老樹、及對面屋宇的白色例映……全體色調沈黯而幽雅、充溢着古園的韻致、</p>
<p>「拙政園新綠」（大幅）……是以園林中的建築爲主題……於鮮丽的木葉底蔭光相映之間、把建築美妙地點綴着、</p>
<p>「放園旁」……以輕淡的筆觸、描寫白墙前一牛、兩老樹、色調明淡面簡朴、含有古風的詩情、</p>
<p>此外、又如淡藍的天空、黃色墙、暗色的路「開元寺之道」……以黑色爲主調的「水邊之家」……沈暗的褐綠水面、遠近有屋宇台閣的「放生魚園」等、都深有情趣、</p>
<p>人物的描寫、則我以銀灰色背景、穿黑衣的女半身像……黑色背景、穿灰色服的男人在半身像「Ｉ氏像」……和有淡赭色背景、以黑色主調所繪的鄕村少女「田舍娘」等爲佳、</p>
<p>鈴木氏、原本他是業匠的、一九二二年、畢業於慈惠醫科大學、曾與其兄同助父業而經營水戶下市醫院、可是一方面、他自糼時便深愛繪畫、而曾受敎於已故的天才畫家中村　氏……自從一九二三年春、出品於「平和博覽會」底美術展」以來他的名聲、聞於畫壇、他對於藝術底熱情、終於戰勝了其職業的意志、且有爲諸力者所激勵、遂毅然放棄其職業、而專心於畫道之精進了、一九二八年赴法研究了三年、去年十二月回國的、去的秋、曾出品於「帝展」、被舉爲「特選」之候補、他一部分的作品、曾爲諸名人所購藏、……從醫術而轉於藝術、且把握着健實的力量、在開拓着其藝術的境地的鈴木氏、倒是現在日本洋畫界之一個别緻的人物…………懷着藝術底純情、而在努力於其創作一事、其態度、我覺得愉快、同時也感到可敬、</p>

<h3 id="c123">歸後 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>醉後不知何處去、　靑松影裏睡朦朧—</p>
<p>這是前天我們在新雅歡迎曾一度失踪而新自遠方歸來的黃的席上、他拿出來給我們看的、是他在無錫的惠山、某某寺裏所抽得的謁語中之最末了的兩句、因爲這件事給我的影像太深了、所以我總怎樣也忘不掉去、丨尤其是這兩句含有些深意的謁語、</p>
<p>黃的此次失踪、實在是太突兀了、說走就走的、在事先、就是和他最友善的默、也沒有知道些兒的消息、關於他這次的異舉的事、我只是知道、在他出走前的一刻、他極其忽促地交給了剛下完堂的姊姊鶯一個小小的、而又極其潦草的紙條兒、於是我們丨每一個黃的朋友的心頭、都給這紙條兒攪起了一個極大的波濤、因爲這紙條兒是報告了我們一個突兀的事實、這上面是潦草地疏疏地寫上了這麽幾行鉛筆細字、</p>
<p>聞鶯同學、現在我報告你一個關於我的不知是幸或是不幸的消息、那就是我决定從此出走了、人生本來是渺茫的、唯其如此、所以渺茫也就是人生了、戀愛、是可以救人、同時她也足人殺人、因爲她畢竟也是渺茫的人生歷程上的一個階段、現在我是想去澈底的完成了我這個渺茫的人生之任務、實在的、宇宙間的事物、壓根兒不都是這麽一回事嗎、我因爲你對於我的一切、比較的多知道了一些、所以我就給你說了這麽一些、其他的、我不願在此多說、請别記掛着我、並請轉致其他諸友、别了、　黃××　×月×日</p>
<p>於是因了這個紙條兒的報告、我們凡是關心着黃的朋友們、莫有不個個大忙而特忙地做着找尋探詢黃的工作了、其間、尤其感到凄惶辛酸的、當然要推非當地愛着黃的蜜絲張和沈兩人、但是結果呢、我們都只有滿抱着一個失望的心兒、黃终究如鴻飛冥冥、石沉海底般的、我們都得不到他一些兒的消息和影踪、我們都只有在焦急和失望的心境中、束手無策地祈禱着由天上降下來的佳音了</p>
<p>像這樣的期待着期待着的日子、差不多過了將近十天了、突然地、在一天的下午、默滿含着他平常很少有的喜容、來到了我們寓所、他是來報告給我們以黃已回來了的消息的啊、這、你想、我們是將怎樣的喜慰哟、於是我們都是以急急地來到了黃的家裏、邀了他到新雅來小吃、作一個盡興的闊别後的小叙、並且同時我們也得見了在這幕悲喜劇中的女主人翁丨蜜絲張和沈、</p>
<p>現在的靑年、最感覺到苦悶的、當然是要以出路和戀愛兩個問題爲首先的問題了、靑年們因這兩個問題的不得解决往往會挺而走險地演出了許多的悲劇、但結果呢、還是一樣的不能解决、這眞是一個於社會國家的生命有着巨大關係的亟須要求解决的問題啊、此次我們的黃之出走、也是感到了他的戀愛問題之不能解决啊、但是黃之所異於别人的、乃是他不是因了失戀而出此、他却是受了兩個都非常熱中着他的女性之夾攻而出此的、眞的、蜜絲張和蜜絲沈、都是非常值得鍾愛的、那麽這又怎能怪黃之弄得手足無措、莫知適從了哩、但據黃自己說、他是非常的愛着沈的、那怕他先前是曾愛過張來、而張一直到此刻、還是忘懷了自我而愛着他、以及社會的一般人士的公認他和張是未來的一對、但他總是只愛着沈、這、眞也是一件沒有辦法的公案啊、</p>
<p>我們到了新雅、我們一方面是快慰地嚼着菜餚、同時我們暢叙着我們别後的一切經過、在這些談話裏、我們每個人都感覺到了有個新的活力、在我們的以頭舞踏着、及至將近　鍾半酣的時分、黃很興奮地站了起來、手裏端着斟得滿滿地的一杯酒、在一種很沉毅而又很凄凉的表情之下、他對我們說了下面的几句話、</p>
<p>我的朋友們、來請、都乾了這一滿杯吧、今天是我們新的生命之開始、同時也是你們的新生命之發軔、過去的一切、都已成爲陳跡了、我們就讓它過去了吧、但將到的未來、我們切莫再讓它輕輕地在我們的眼底下溜過、我們得切實地把握着它、悲觀、消極、頽唐、厭世、這只是在沒出息的人兒嘴裏才有的、我現在是覺悟了、我知道這些都是不太值得的、這些都並不是爲我們所要求的解决之路、這僅不過是一種自溺的陷阱吧了、現在、朋友們、我們都該得去努力追求我們光明之獲得、然後、我們再進而謀其他問題之解决、這才是正當的辦法啊、朋友們、我們大家一齊來努力吧、</p>
<p>本來我們每個人的心、都是非常和平和愉快的、但是一經聽了他這種沉毅的調了和一字一句都會打動我們心的語句時、我們的心、也都逐漸地被他同化了、我們祇感覺到在我們的心葉上、這時突地給浮起了一股辨别不出其爲甜、爲酸、爲苦、爲辣、的滋味、眞所謂别具一番滋味在心頭哩、我們聽完了他的說話、誰也沒說一句什麽、只是面面相覬地作了一個會意的微笑、很痛怪地都乾了滿滿的一杯、呵、這情境吓、是决不能用蠢笨的字句和　言語來描摩和形容的、這只有身臨其境的人、才能領會到的啊、</p>
<p>在歸來的途中、我只企望着和罣惦着歸來後的朋友丨新生命的朋友黃吓、</p>

<h3 id="e8">Stipulates Repayment Methods <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Shanxi Provincial Government announced six repayment methods for the four million grain and forage loan on the 15th. The main points are as follows: 1. The four million loan will be fully collected in provincial currency, specifically for repaying the advance payments made by various counties before the end of May of the 20th year (1931) for the purchase of grain and forage for allied troops, and will not be used for other purposes. It is temporarily guaranteed by the Shuohuguan customs duties and various Shanxi production taxes. It will be repaid after the Central Government collects the arrears owed to the allied troops. If the arrears are not collected, the principal and interest will be repaid in installments from the designated tax funds. 2. The annual interest rate is 6%, calculated from the day after it is delivered to the Provincial Government. 3. After receiving the loan, each county government should first issue a receipt, which will be compiled and submitted to the Provincial Department of Finance for verification and issuance of vouchers. 4. Before the end of June of the 21st year (1932), only interest will be paid on the aforementioned loan. From July of the 21st year (1932), the principal and interest will be repaid every six months in installments, with both principal and interest to be cleared within three years, with June 12th of each year being the date for repayment of principal and interest. All interest payable before the end of June of the 20th year (1931) will be paid in the first installment. 5. Counties that have advanced funds for grain and forage for allied troops are allowed to retain this loan, but only those that have been approved on record are eligible. 6.

Ji replied that the Deputy Commander's Headquarters is a military organization and, in public opinion, certainly does not manage tax collection. Before the implementation of the production and sales taxes, the Deputy Commander's Headquarters was completely unaware. Now that the opposition from the public is known, this matter can be presented on behalf of public opinion after the Deputy Commander recovers from his illness. However, when everyone requests to see him, please do not say that you are seeing the Deputy Commander, because the Deputy Commander does not manage Hebei's tax affairs. You can say that you are seeing Zhang Xueliang. Zhang is a member of the nation and cannot but exert himself for you. The representatives decided to seriously negotiate with Jing Youyan tomorrow morning. If they do not get results, they will launch a second major petition. In today's declaration, they said that if it is not thoroughly resolved, they will fight to the end. (16th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Recent Diplomatic Issues <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The greatest hope of the Chinese people today is, on the one hand, to eliminate the scourge of bandits and stabilize people's livelihoods, and on the other hand, to implement the abolition of unequal treaties and enhance international status. However, the so-called abolition of unequal treaties is only to recover the rights that our country should have, and there is no expectation beyond what is due. Therefore, we still proceed with the intention of peace and sincerity to conduct friendly diplomacy with various countries. However, countries that want to maintain their illegally obtained rights often cannot understand each other and add obstacles whenever something happens. As for the news obtained today regarding Japan and Russia, we cannot but regret it. The Japanese Consul General stationed in Liaoning recently protested to the Northeast authorities regarding issues such as the oppression of Koreans by the Chinese. The so-called oppression of Koreans refers to the Wanbaoshan case in Changchun. The Wanbaoshan case arose because a large group of Koreans forcibly dug up farmland and diverted the waters of the Yitong River to develop the interests of their rice paddy company. As for our farmers, they believed that if the digging was completed, not only would a lot of good farmland be destroyed, but in the future, if there was a large flood, the farmland of nearly two thousand hectares would be affected. Therefore, the local authorities requested an order to stop it. However, the Koreans continued to dig forcibly and sent the police to protect the site. These facts are detailed in the newspapers. We were hoping that the Japanese Consul General would deal with the matter fairly to alleviate the ill feelings of the area. However, we did not expect that he would regard it as oppression of Koreans and recognize that our people have anti-Japanese intentions. This is truly astonishing. Also, in the recent Sino-Russian conference, we were hoping that it would eliminate the estrangement between the two countries and restore successful trade. However, we did not expect that before the issue of redeeming the railway was concluded, the Russian side suddenly proposed a plan to change the system of the Chinese Eastern Railway and modify the management rules, advocating that the Supervisory Board be abolished altogether. On the surface, it was to reduce the administration due to the recession in business, but in reality, it was nothing more than expanding the authority of the Russian Director to make everything in the Eastern Railway come under his control. From this, it can be seen that this conference did not truly intend to be friendly with us. It cannot but be regrettable.</p>

<p>British House of Commons Passes Land Tax Amendment</p>
<p>Labor Government Fails</p>
<p>Liberal Party Compromises with Labor Party</p>
<p>Expected Not to Cause Political Turmoil</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Reports on Negotiations Regarding Rights and Interests in China</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - The Conservative Party today introduced an amendment in the House of Commons to the land tax plan in the Finance Bill proposed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden, advocating for tax exemption for agricultural land. This amendment passed with 232 votes against 208 votes. After the report of the result, someone shouted "Resign!" The Prime Minister, in response to a question from Conservative Party leader Baldwin, said that the nature of this amendment was inconsequential and that everything would proceed as usual. The Conservative Party then introduced a more serious amendment, but this time more government members were present, so the proposal was defeated. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting late at night to discuss the Liberal Party's proposed alternative to the land tax amendment. It is expected that the political turmoil can be quelled.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th - Last night, the Liberal Party decided to change its land tax amendment and recognize a large part of the government's original proposal. However, the newspapers this morning remain pessimistic about the scene of tonight's government debate in the House of Commons. It is expected that if negotiators cannot make Snowden change his position in the last five minutes, then Parliament will have to be dissolved. It is now heard that Snowden has not been willing to compromise. It is also heard that government representatives in Geneva participating in the Mandates Commission and the Labor Congress have been ordered to prepare to fly back to London if necessary in order to vote in the House of Commons. The Cabinet convened an emergency meeting late at night, but the result is unknown.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 16th - British mining official Irving and Colonial Undersecretary Hills have now received instructions from the government not to return home for the time being. Otherwise, they would fly back to London today in order to attend the crucial resolution of the land tax amendment in the House of Commons tonight.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - Today, the House of Commons asked Foreign Secretary Henderson to publish a report from British Minister to China Lampson regarding the negotiations to abolish extraterritoriality. The Foreign Secretary replied that a detailed report has not yet been received and cannot be published immediately. Furthermore, the results of the negotiations cannot be made public until the political situation in China allows for the conclusion of a final agreement. The Foreign Secretary also answered a question from a member of parliament, saying that the Guangdong government's actions regarding tariffs are not something that the British government should interfere with.</p>
<p>German Parliament Committee Rejects Motion to Convene Parliament</p>
<p>The Future of the Political Situation is Not Yet Optimistic</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, 16th - The German Parliament's standing committee has rejected motions from left and right wing opposition parties calling for the immediate convening of parliament to discuss and reject emergency decrees. However, the fate of the cabinet still hinges on the committee's vote tonight on the Social Democratic Party's motion to submit the emergency decrees to the Parliament's budget committee. Chancellor Brüning opposes this move and is currently continuing consultations with the relevant parties. The result of today's standing committee's discussion of the previous motion is the culmination of yesterday's consultations between the Chancellor and party leaders from noon to midnight. However, the situation during yesterday's negotiations was the opposite of what was expected externally; the two sides did not reach an understanding. The German Chancellor firmly rejected the immediate convening of parliament and the immediate amendment of the emergency decrees, saying that if the parties do not accept the government's current policies, then the cabinet will have no choice but to resign, and he is unwilling to form a new cabinet again. Therefore, there are many pessimistic views on the future of the situation, and there are even rumors that the government will establish a dictatorship based on Article 48 of the Constitution. President Hindenburg is vacationing at his home in East Prussia. Due to the seriousness of the situation, he will immediately return to the capital. He is expected to arrive in Berlin tonight. Newspapers here commented that there are disagreements not only between the German Parliament and the Cabinet, but also between the parliaments and cabinets of England and France. Therefore, it is possible that the governments of the three major European powers may be overthrown at the same time one day.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, 15th - The German political situation seemed to be improving in the last forty-eight hours, but it has now fallen into darkness again because Chancellor Brüning's negotiations with the Social Democratic Party have reached a breaking point. When Brüning met with the leaders of the party, the party leaders stated that they were unwilling to immediately convene Parliament to abolish the emergency decrees, and Brüning also strongly stated that the diplomatic situation was extremely urgent and that Germany was preparing to negotiate with the great powers. He did not want domestic disturbances to occur at this time. Brüning also strongly guaranteed that no more emergency decrees would be issued in the near future. However, the meeting ultimately broke up without results because the Social Democratic Party requested that only the Parliament's Budget Committee be convened to amend the emergency decrees, which was also rejected by Brüning. Brüning's only concession was that the amendment to the emergency decrees would be drafted and then discussed only when Parliament was reconvened in mid-October after the current parliamentary recess. The Social Democratic Party clearly expressed dissatisfaction with this and immediately advocated for the immediate convening of Parliament.</p>
<p>Briand Shows Goodwill to Austria and Germany</p>
<p>Organize Special Committee to Investigate Economic Conditions</p>
<p>Using Diplomatic Tactics</p>
<p>As a Tool for Political Struggle</p>
<p>Kokumin, Paris, 15th - Foreign Minister Briand convened a bank conference today, attended by the Governor of the Bank of France and the heads of major banks. They had a deep discussion on the recent financial and economic crises in Germany and Austria. As a result, it was decided to organize a special committee, including six people from the banking sector and eight people from the industrial sector, to go to Berlin, Vienna, and other important locations to conduct on-site investigations. Then, based on their reports, they will try to provide international assistance to avoid the deterioration and spread of the crisis. It is said that Briand's plan is indeed a manifestation of goodwill towards Germany and Austria, but it also involves the undercurrents of domestic politics, because the opposition is trying to use the resignation of the cabinet in Geneva to push Briand into a state of idleness, and Briand has to use diplomatic tactics as a tool for political struggle.</p>

<p>Current Military Strength of the United States and Japan</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 15th - US Secretary of State Stimson today, at the request of the League of Nations, submitted a detailed report on US military strength to Geneva and released it to the newspapers simultaneously. It includes a total of 139,957 army officers and soldiers, a total of 109,886 navy personnel, and a total of 27,324 air force personnel, combining the air forces of the army, navy, and marine corps. The warship registry is largely the same as the one sent to the League of Nations General Assembly last year. Stimson stated at the time of publication that he hoped other countries would take the same approach to facilitate the progress of preparations for the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, Nagasaki, 16th - The Ministry of the Army, which has always kept details of its military strength secret, has now released the numbers, intending to submit them to the International Disarmament Conference.

<p>And Cables Li Liejun and Others to Return to Jiangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: Chairman Chiang has now decided to eliminate the Red Bandits' Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang factions, and has issued strict orders for each army to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression. He has also decided to personally come to Jiangxi to supervise the troops within days. According to news from the Field Headquarters, Chiang will depart after the closing of the Fifth Plenary Session. The General Headquarters has sent adjutants and staff to the province ahead of time to arrange everything. Chiang's residence will still be located in the Baihuazhou Library, and Director He will move to the Xinyuan Middle School to work. Public spaces and vacant rooms near Baihuazhou Zhongshan Road are all marked with signs saying "Residence of General Commander's Guards and Transportation Team." Provincial and municipal party headquarters and various organizations have recently sent telegrams to welcome Chairman Chiang. It is heard that Chiang's visit to Jiangxi this time is with the greatest determination to eliminate the Red Bandits. He will command no fewer than 300,000 troops and will still take the strategy of encirclement and annihilation. He is also paying special attention to political rehabilitation and the elimination of bandit sources. Various party headquarters and mass organizations in the province believe that Chiang will organize a special committee in Jiangxi to preside over post-war affairs, and have sent telegrams to urge Li Liejun, Liu Luyin, Xiong Shihui, Huang Jiemin, Xu Suzhou, and others to return to Jiangxi from Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan to preside over everything in order to gather the collective wisdom and efforts of the people.

<h3 id="e20">Chen Jitang Takes a Defensive Posture <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Main Force Concentrated in Northeastern and Eastern Rivers</p>
<p>Now Deployed in a Large Arc Shape</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Guangdong Province's military deployment has suddenly become more active recently. In the Chaoshan area, Chen Jitang had already dispatched a mine-laying team to Shantou to deploy naval mines and torpedoes inside and outside the port of Shantou, but has not increased troops. Only the First Independent Division (now expanded into the Second Independent Division) and Zhang Ruigui's troops are deployed in Chaoan, Songkou, and Meixian. The original 62nd Division, Xiang Hanping's troops, stationed in Chaozhou and Meizhou, have been transferred back to the suburbs of Guangzhou for deployment. In this situation, Chen may completely abandon Chaoshan if necessary. The important defense areas are focused on the Huizhou, Pingshan, Danshui, and Heyuan line. The First Independent Division, Huang Renhuan's troops, have been transferred here to be responsible for deployment. Huang's Guanyi regiment is currently stationed in the Huiyang area, and Zeng Youren's regiment is stationed in the Heyuan area. Chen Jitang believes that Huang is familiar with the terrain of the East River, so he has assigned Huang's division to be the main force on the Huizhou front line. Recently, a newly compiled division was transferred to assist in the defense, and a large number of defensive tools, such as bamboo spikes and electric nets, were transported there. The second line of defense from Huizhou down to the suburbs is guarded by the former 62nd Division (now reorganized into the Second Army), Xiang Hanping's troops. Xiang's troops are stationed along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to Zengcheng Longmen. Zengcheng is connected to Huaxian and Kunlian in the North River. Large pontoon bridges have been built in this area to facilitate mutual contact between the troops in the northeast and east rivers. This is the situation in which Chen Jitang is taking a defensive posture in the East River. As for the North River, it is currently defended by two divisions. The front line is the 63rd Division (now reorganized into the Third Army), Li Yangjing's troops. Currently, Li's Huang Zhiwen and Huang Yanzhen brigades have moved from Shaoguan to Nanxiong Shixing to be responsible for the first line of defense. The 59th Division (now reorganized into the First Army), Yu Hanmou's troops, are stationed in Yingde, Yuantan, Juntain, Xinjie, and Huaxian to coordinate the northeast and east rivers. Therefore, the Guangdong army is now deployed in a large arc shape from Nanxiong in the North River to Huizhou in the East River. It is expected that the focus of future battles will be in Huizhou and Xingning in the East River, Shaoguan and Yingde in the North River, and Zengcheng and Huaxian in the northeast corner of the suburbs. It is feared that there will be a final fierce battle in the future. As for the Hunan-Guangxi area, it is purely the responsibility of Zhang and Gui's troops to defend. The details are not yet known.

<p>Dai Chuanxian Reports on the Premier's Martyrdom</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning on the 16th, the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a memorial meeting for the ninth anniversary of the Premier's martyrdom in Guangzhou. Those present included Chiang Kai-shek, Cai Yuanpei, Dai Chuanxian, Ding Weifen, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu, Fang Juehui, Zhou Qigang, Chen Zhaoying, Zhu Jiahua, Cheng Tianfang, He Chengjun, Zeng Yangfu, Yu Jingtang, Enke Ba Tu, and more than a thousand people, including all staff and representatives of various agencies. Zhang Ji presided over the meeting, and Dai Chuanxian reported on the Premier's martyrdom, briefly stating that today is the memorial of the Premier's martyrdom. The facts and circumstances have been reported every year. Today's report is just repeating what was said last year, and I feel that everyone already knows it, so it is not necessary. Therefore, today's report is about a feeling that arose from what I talked about with Mr. Zhang Puquan in the car today. Mr. Puquan said that he still clearly remembers the impression he had when he first met the Premier in Shanghai after the Premier's martyrdom. When the Premier passed through Guangzhou, he was as calm as usual, with a smile on his face and a very open mind. At that time, everyone inevitably felt some sadness after the defeat in Guangdong, but seeing the Premier like that, everyone felt much more at ease. It can be seen that the more the revolution fails, the stronger the belief in doctrine becomes. This is all the courage gained from the Premier's smile. Therefore, to believe in doctrine, one must have ambition and value doctrine above life. This is true faith. I hope everyone will commemorate and continue the spirit of the Premier's martyrdom. The more difficult it is, the more we must strive. We must fulfill the new responsibilities borne by the results of the National Assembly, and we must complete the permanent construction of the Three Principles of the People. This is the feeling of today's commemoration, etc. Next, Zheng Luosheng gave a speech, which was lengthy and omitted. The meeting adjourned at eleven o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Case of Japanese Nationals Detained for Smuggling Qin and Han Dynasty Bricks and Tiles via the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Shandong Department of Education Sends Personnel to Verify the Situation</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul-General Strenuously Objects to Transportation to Jinan</p>
<p>The Port Authority Detains Another Batch of Antiquities</p>
<p>Negotiations Regarding Transportation from Qingdao to Jinan</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: The previous report detailed the detention by the Qingdao station of the Jiaoji Railway of Japanese national Ota, who was privately selling all the Qin and Han dynasty bricks and tiles of the Gao family in Weixian for transport to Japan, and the dispatch of personnel by the Shandong Department of Education to Qingdao to negotiate the confiscation and transport measures. It is now learned that after Wu Jingshou, secretary of the Shandong Department of Education, arrived in Qingdao, he immediately contacted the Jiaoji Railway Bureau and the Municipal Government to discuss the confiscation and transportation methods, and also telegraphed both parties to request assistance in handling the matter. At 3:00 PM on the 12th, personnel from the Shandong Department of Education, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, and the Municipal Government jointly dispatched personnel to open and inspect the sealed items. The Japanese Consulate and the antique dealer were also notified in advance to come to the site for verification. Those who attended on that day included Wu Jingshou from the Shandong Department of Education, Wen Shao from the Education Bureau, Li Zhaoyuan from the Social Affairs Bureau, Shi Runsheng from the Jiaoji Railway Party Department, Sui Jigu, Ma Guanwei, Zhang Yulin, Su Shoubin, and Fujita from the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, Tong Qingshan from the First Police Section, Zhou Shizhen, the stationmaster, Zhang Liangzuo from the Public Security Bureau, Pi Gaopin and Ding Botao from Qingdao University, and newspaper reporters. The Japanese side was represented by the Deputy Consul-General Hyakutake, Ueda Takayoshi, Shanxi Sidairo, and the antique dealer Ota. When the seal was opened, personnel from all parties were present to observe, but the Japanese personnel sat in the office and refused to come to the site for inspection. The Japanese Consul-General strenuously objected to the transportation of the antiquities to Jinan, stating that items purchased by private individuals with money should not be confiscated. Secretary Wu Jingshou replied that he was acting on the orders of the central government and that there was no confiscation, but only temporary custody, and that future handling would depend on the central government's instructions. After the debate, the inspection began. The first box contained 50 rectangular bricks and 7 small rectangular bricks, all with seal script inscriptions such as "May you be immortal for ten thousand generations" and "May you live a thousand autumns." The second box contained 9 large rectangular bricks and 143 small bricks, each with red edges. The inscriptions on the bricks varied, with some having nine characters, "May your descendants be secure, prosperous, and happy without end," and others having four characters, "Peace and happiness without end," "Limitless as the heavens," "Wei Zi tile count," and "Zhaoyang Palace Dang." The third box contained 175 packages of circular tile ends, each with the inscription "Prolong life and increase longevity." The fourth box contained 66 bricks of various sizes, all with inscriptions. The fifth box contained 89 bricks of various sizes, including square hollow bricks with patterns covering the entire surface, with ancient figures in the middle of the patterns. The sixth box was a long stone stele, engraved with two phoenixes. The seventh box was a rectangular broken stone tablet, which was not opened because it had been inspected the first time. After inspection, seals from the Department of Education, the Education Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau were affixed. Because the Japanese Deputy Consul-General was present, a seal from the Japanese Consulate-General in Qingdao was also affixed to the first box. Due to time constraints, only the number of items in each box was checked, and the names and dynasties of the bricks, tiles, and steles were not studied. However, according to experts in antique appraisal present at the scene, they were definitely precious Qin and Han dynasty antiquities. Although these antiquities have been inspected, they are still stored in the Qingdao station warehouse because the Japanese side does not allow them to be transported to Jinan. The Japanese Consulate in Qingdao has directly negotiated with the National Government on behalf of the Japanese merchant, and a decision on whether to confiscate all of them or pay a reasonable price will be made after the National Government's reply. Secretary Wu of the Shandong Department of Education has completed his mission and took the Jiaoji Railway train back to Jinan on the evening of the 13th to report everything to the Department of Education.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Port Authority discovered another large batch of antiquities, totaling ten large boxes, at the Dagang Wharf. It is said that the foreign firm Meiji Trading Company purchased them from the interior of our country with the intention of shipping them abroad. Unexpectedly, when they were being loaded onto the ship, they were recognized by the personnel of the Port Authority's Surveillance Section, who immediately detained them and reported them to the Municipal Government for verification. The Municipal Government, considering that the items were related to Chinese culture, immediately approved the detention and decided that personnel from the Education Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau should be dispatched on the 15th to jointly open the boxes for inspection with the Port Authority, and then decide on how to deal with them. (June 13th)</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: After the Qin and Han dynasty bricks and tiles from Weixian were detained in Qingdao, the Shandong Department of Education, in order to preserve the antiquities, sent staff member Wu Jingshou to Qingdao to transport them to Jinan for safekeeping. After several twists and turns, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways, which allowed them to be transported. After Wu Jingshou inspected them in Qingdao on the 12th, they were transported on the 13th. The Jiaoji Railway specially allocated a separate guard car for transportation and telegraphed all stations along the line to protect them properly. Unexpectedly, just as preparations were being made for loading on the morning of the 13th, the Japanese again strongly objected. The Japanese national Ota, who purchased the antiquities, had returned to Japan and entrusted Kuhara to transport them to Japan. Kuhara informed the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao, who negotiated with our government officials on the one hand and informed Kagasaka Gaku (also a Japanese national, currently the Chief of the Traffic Department of the Jiaoji Railway) on the other hand, asking Ge Guangting, the Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, to prevent the start of transportation. The commotion lasted all day, and the planned arrival in Jinan on the 13th was changed. Finally, Wu Jingshou visited Ge Guangting, the Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, and earnestly stated that the transportation of the antiquities to Jinan for safekeeping was being carried out by the Department of Education on the orders of the Ministry of Education and by the Jiaoji Railway Bureau on the orders of the Ministry of Railways. Now, because of the Japanese obstruction, transportation could not begin. Was the Railway Bureau giving more weight to the orders of the Ministry or to the Japanese? It would be better to transport them to Jinan first and then negotiate with the Japanese. Ge agreed and discussed it with Kagasaka Gaku, who could do nothing about it. The matter was resolved at 8:00 PM that evening. As a result, the antiquities were transported from Qingdao at 7:10 AM on the 14th and arrived at Jinan Station at 7:13 PM that day. Just as they were about to be transported, there was a sudden thunderstorm, so they were placed on the platform under the watch of the railway police. This morning (the 15th) at 8:00 AM, Pi Songyun, the Section Chief of the Department of Education, and Wang Xiantang, the Director of the Provincial Library, accompanied Wu Jingshou to the Jiaoji Railway Station and directed the use of cars to transport them to the library. It was decided to inspect them again in the afternoon. An exhibition will be held in the library within the day to make them publicly viewable, to arouse public interest and attention in the preservation of antiquities. It has been verified that the bricks and tiles consist of seven boxes, about 530 pieces, and the stone tablets consist of two boxes, a total of five pieces. (June 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Banditry in Southern Shandong's Meng Mountain Resurges <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: When the bandit gang of Guo Mafeng in Baodu Mountain, Southern Shandong, was defeated, only about 700 bandits remained. Now, scattered bandit gangs such as those of Yin Tuxi and Yin Tugui have suddenly gathered again in Meng Mountain and occupied the areas around Bailingyan, Jiunuguan, Niulan Village, and Zhang Village. Their arrogance is gradually increasing. The troops of Tang Yaoxun, the Southern Shandong Militia Army, and the troops of Chen Yaohan have planned a joint suppression. Currently, Tang Yaoxun has come to Jinan from Qufu to report the latest situation of the bandit suppression to Han Fuqu. According to Tang's statement to reporters, the bandit gangs of Guo Mafeng, Yin Shixi, and Yin Shigui in Meng Mountain total more than 1,000 people, occupying the mountains. They avoid the troops when they come, and return when they leave. It is quite troublesome to suppress them. The Kong Xianfang regiment stationed in Si County is currently patrolling back and forth to prevent other defections. My visit to Jinan this time is to ask Chairman Han for heavy artillery to bombard them and to request permission to transfer the entire brigade to completely wipe out the bandits. Wang Wanqing, the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Shandong Militia, also talked about the bandit situation in Meng Mountain, saying that when the bandits first fled from Nanshan, there were only seven or eight hundred people, but now, after gathering the forces of Yin Shigui, Li Doujin, and Li Douyin, they have reached more than 2,000 people. Lu Lianzhang's First Battalion and Liu Jianming's Second Battalion of the Southern Shandong Militia are currently assisting Tang's brigade in suppressing the scattered bandits in Meng. The headquarters of the militia was previously ordered by the Chairman to move to Pingyi Town to be responsible for the suppression in the seven counties of Fei, Si, Meng, Lin, Zou, Teng, and Yi. However, active suppression has not yet been effective. This time, coming to Jinan, I have discussed proper measures with Chairman Han and will return to Pingyi tomorrow to defend and implement them.</p>

<p>Shao Lizi Will Also Return South Soon</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Cheng Xixian, the representative of Shi Yousan, and Hai Tao, the representative of Ma Hongkui, came to Jinan from Shunde on the 11th to negotiate everything with Shao Lizi, Jiang Bocheng, and Han Fuqu. At 12:00 PM on the 13th, they returned to Shunde to report. Han Fuqu specially sent an armored car to send Cheng to Dezhou, and then Cheng took a car from Dezhou to Shunde. Before leaving, Cheng told people that the results of this visit were extremely satisfactory and that the task had been accomplished. (1) To explain the attitude of General Commander Shi to dispel rumors. Shi's troops are stationed in their original defense areas, and there are absolutely no problems in the Yellow River basin. (2) The issue of food for the 13th Route Army. The monthly salary of the 13th Route Army has now been issued by the central government, and the 200,000 from the Northeast has also been allocated. The military salary can be maintained, but clothing and other equipment are still insufficient. He has asked Committee Member Shao, Chief of General Staff Jiang, and Chairman Han to petition the central government on their behalf, and they have all generously agreed. Therefore, he will return to Shunde to report and will come to Jinan again within the day. Furthermore, Ma Hongkui believed that the results of this mediation on the issue of military salary for Shi's troops were satisfactory, so he also returned to Tai'an last night. Central Committee Member Shao Lizi will also return to Nanjing soon to report. Judging from this situation, the overall situation is very optimistic. (June 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e28">The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior Jointly Establish a Film Censorship Committee <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Censorship Will Begin on the 16th</p>
<p>Films in Concessions Must Also Be Censored</p>
<p>And Issue Orders to Unify Censorship Administration</p>
<p>The Film Censorship Committee jointly established by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior will begin censorship on the 16th of this month. In order to fundamentally eliminate bad films, all films shown in concessions must also be censored in accordance with the law. This matter has been submitted by the Film Censorship Committee through the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, and consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has notified various diplomatic missions, stating: "According to the Film Censorship Committee's report, since the establishment of this committee, all preparations have been completed and it will soon begin to censor films in various provinces and cities. However, Article 1 of the Film Censorship Law promulgated by the central government on November 3, 1930 stipulates that all films, whether domestic or foreign, must not be shown unless they have been censored by this committee in accordance with the law. Therefore, there is no doubt that both Chinese and foreign films must be censored. However, there are many theaters in ordinary provinces and cities, and there are also many in various concessions. Now, in order to thoroughly enforce the law and carry out censorship, this committee intends to uniformly censor films shown in concessions. If anyone shows films that have not been censored and approved and do not have a permit to show them, they will be severely punished once discovered, so that bad films from China and foreign countries can be eliminated in our country. Therefore, we are preparing a document to request consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify diplomatic missions that all Chinese and foreign films shown in concessions must first be censored and approved by this committee. If they do not have a permit to show them issued by this committee, they will be prohibited from showing them without authorization. Based on this, the matters reported by the committee are intended to fundamentally eliminate bad films, which is feasible. In addition to the instructions, we are enclosing 30 copies each of the Film Censorship Law and the Implementing Regulations of the Film Censorship Law for your review and notification to various diplomatic missions."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education jointly ordered the Departments of Civil Affairs and Education of various provinces, the Weihaiwei Management Office, and the Social Education Bureaus of Nanjing and other five cities, stating: "We have received Instruction No. 528 from the Executive Yuan, which states: 'We hereby issue an order for action. The Implementing Regulations of the Film Censorship Law and the Organizational Regulations of the Film Censorship Committee have now been formulated, promulgated, and implemented by this Yuan. In addition to issuing separate instructions, we are hereby enclosing the original provisions for your information and to instruct your subordinates to be informed accordingly. This order, etc.' We have also received a copy of the aforementioned regulations and articles of association. We hereby instruct that the Film Censorship Committee has now been formally established (affiliated to the Ministry of Education). In order to unify censorship administration, all existing film censorship agencies in various places should cease their duties from the date of receipt of this document. The educational authorities in various places should also, in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the Implementing Regulations of the Film Censorship Law, clearly list the names and positions of the appointed censors (one to five persons), along with two 2.5-inch headshots of each person, and send them directly to the Film Censorship Committee to obtain a censorship certificate. Before receiving the censorship certificate, please continue to carry out censorship as before. In view of the foregoing, in addition to issuing separate orders, we are hereby enclosing the original text of the aforementioned regulations and articles of association for your departments to comply with and to instruct your subordinates to comply with accordingly."</p>
<h3 id="e29">Ni Daolang Engages in Activities in Bengbu <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Ni Sichong's private property in Anhui was confiscated and nationalized when the Northern Expeditionary Army first arrived in Anhui. Some time ago, Ni Sichong's son, Daojie, invoked the amnesty decree and submitted a request to the National Government to return his private property in Anhui, but it was not approved. Recently, Ni Sichong's nephew, Daolang, has come forward to lobby for its return. However, many people in Anhui are opposed to it. A few days ago, Daolang secretly came to Bengbu and secretly contacted former gentry in an attempt to sell the private property in Bengbu that had already been confiscated. It is said that the pre-determined selling price of the real estate is 1.6 million yuan, with the intention of reporting a donation of several tens of thousands to a certain important person in Anhui Province. The local district party department believes that Ni Daolang was one of the four great henchmen of Ni Sichong's era and a major criminal in the Jiang Gaoqi massacre. Recently, he secretly came to Bengbu to conspire to sell the seized property. Therefore, a special telegram was sent to denounce him, calling for his expulsion from the country and preventing the return of Ni Sichong's private property. (June 15th)</p>

<p>Water Police Suppress Bandits and Rescue Hostages: Fan Guozhong, captain of the first water police unit, recently learned of a large gang of bandits gathering and kidnapping people in the Songjiang-Qingpu border area. On the 10th, Fan personally led deputy captains Gong Guozhen and patrol officer Yao Yuangeng, each commanding a police boat, to Fengjing. They discovered that the bandits were in the Bailongtan area of Qingpu, taking advantage of the surrounding reeds, making it difficult to search. They hired boats, disguised themselves, and each carried firearms. They set off at midnight on the 12th and arrived at the border by dawn. The bandits were alerted, and both sides opened fire. After about half an hour, the bandits were defeated and tried to escape by swimming. The water police pursued closely and captured bandit Shi Ziyuan on the spot, along with a bandit boat containing four hostages, including Sun Baoquan from Fengxiatang. They also confiscated uniforms from the anti-smuggling team. Shi confessed to killing anti-smuggling team member Yu Jinbiao the day before. Fan considered the matter serious and reported it to the regional headquarters for review.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Progress in Establishing County Courts: The High Court has decided to first establish the Steel Mountain Higher Third Branch Court and the Changshu and Taixing County Courts, starting in the 20th year of the Republic. Additionally, the Qingjiangpu Higher First Branch Court will be able to hear first-instance cases from the 20th year of the Republic. Other judicial systems may also undergo changes.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Zhao Black Fish Stolen Goods Appeal: Zhao Black Fish (also known as Yang Chunbei), a Taihu pirate, had previously colluded to kidnap Xiong Tongxing's duck business in Nantian, stealing over 2,100 silver dollars. He was later arrested in Shanghai by Xu Fengshan, a detective from the Third Water Public Security District, who recovered 2,130.08 silver dollars. Zhao was extradited back to Suzhou and tried by the Wuxian District Court, which sentenced him to six life sentences, with one life sentence to be served. Zhao Black Fish appealed the decision to the High Court, which ruled on April 11 of this year to reduce the sentence to two life sentences, combined into one life sentence to be served. Zhao Black Fish still disagreed and is now appealing to the Supreme Court. After the case was solved, the victim, Xiong Ruqing, learned that Zhao Black Fish's stolen silver dollars were being held at the Wuxian District Court. Last year, he filed a civil lawsuit with the Wuxian District Court, requesting the return of the stolen silver dollars. The court ruled in his favor. Zhao Black Fish appealed this decision to the High Court. Yesterday (the 16th), Judge Zheng Zhiguo of the Civil First Chamber of the High Court convened a hearing. Zhao Black Fish claimed that 1,800 silver dollars belonged to Zhao Guilin and that he only had 330.08 silver dollars. Judge Zheng then persuaded both parties to reconcile. As a result, Xiong Ruqing was allowed to claim Zhao Guilin's 1,800 silver dollars, while Zhao Black Fish was allowed to claim the remaining 330.08 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Suzhou Women's School Schedules Takeover of Warehouses: Suzhou Women's School had a dispute with the Warehouse Committee over the possession of Baosu Bureau warehouse buildings. The provincial government ordered the county government to convene both parties for reconciliation, allowing the Suzhou Women's School to take possession of the buildings for school construction. However, the handover had not yet been completed. Yesterday (the 16th), the county government convened both parties for mediation again. As a result, both parties agreed to carry out the handover on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Appeal for Increased Ratio of Public Sale of Alcohol: The public sale fee for tobacco and alcohol in Wuxi was initially only 30,000 yuan per year. Since the adoption of a bidding system in the 17th year of the Republic, competition has arisen, resulting in Bao Pu winning the bid with a maximum amount of 71,300 yuan per year, more than double the original ratio. Various liquor merchants have repeatedly appealed, but the ratio has not been reduced. Recently, the Ministry of Finance decided to change the organization and collection method. Unexpectedly, someone named Yu and others increased the bid significantly, to over 90,000 yuan per year, and their application was approved. Upon hearing this news, the soy sauce and liquor industry association urgently convened a temporary meeting to discuss solutions. They generally believed that the public sale fee in the area had increased by more than double in one year due to speculation and competition, which was significantly different from neighboring counties. If the ratio were to be increased again, it would be too difficult to bear. After unanimous discussion, they decided to send a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, requesting that the changes in organization and collection method be clearly announced in advance. They also requested that the approval of the increased ratio be temporarily suspended. At the same time, they appointed Qing Junqian, Tao Guanru, and others to go to Beijing to petition the ministry and bureaus.</p>
<p>Robbery of Two Families in Tangtou Town: In Ren Lane, Tangtou Town (Tianshang City), in the fifth district of the county, the home of Ren Achuan was suddenly invaded by more than ten robbers dressed in short blue shirts and pants, speaking in strange accents, each wielding a pistol and flashlight, breaking down the back door around 1:00 AM on the 15th. At that time, the Achuan family was already asleep. Hearing the alarm, his son, Jinrong, urgently climbed onto the roof and shouted for help, angering the robbers. They immediately opened fire, and a bullet pierced Jinrong's thigh, causing him to fall onto the roof. The robbers then tied Achuan's hands behind his back, forcing him to reveal the location of his silver. After searching for a long time, they stole seven silver dollars, over ten thousand copper coins, and two silver bracelets. The robbers then carried the stolen goods to the roof and arbitrarily searched the home of Ren Shifang, who lived next door. Shifang was a former village head and had some wealth, so the losses were significant. Ren Jinrong, who was injured on the roof, was taken by his father, Achuan, by boat to the city that night to be treated at the hospital. It is said that his leg bone was shattered, and he may become disabled.</p>

<p>Students Petition Against Closure of Women's Vocational School: The Wujin Education Bureau held an education administration meeting on the 14th and decided to close the Women's Vocational School. The general students would be sent to various girls' schools with comparable levels, while the specialized students would be subsidized with the original funding to continue their studies at the school that takes over the program, until the current class graduates. The school buildings would be taken back by the Education Bureau to be used as a public education center. Upon hearing the news, all the students of the school convened a meeting on the 15th and decided to send two representatives from each of the six grades to the Education Bureau, the County Party Headquarters, and the County Government to petition for its continuation. The Education Bureau and the County Government agreed to submit it for reconsideration at the next meeting. The County Party Headquarters said that this was a decision made by a majority of the committee members, and the Party Headquarters as individuals could not provide any response. As for the students' study problems, the Education Bureau would find a suitable solution for them. Only then did the representatives return to school.</p>

<p>County Purge Concludes: The Zhenjiang County Purge Bureau previously received a notice from the provincial bureau stating that the county purge and the purge work in various districts of the county had not been completed within the prescribed time limit. The headquarters had given the county bureau and its branches a demerit according to the reward and punishment regulations. Now, the county bureau concluded its work on May 31. All unfinished matters of the county purge were to be handled and reported by the county government.

Yesterday, the Zhenjiang County Government ordered all districts to cancel the name of the purge branches. All forms and documents that should be sent are to be reported to the county government for forwarding within three days of receiving the notice, to facilitate the conclusion of the purge.</p>
<p>Security Chief Flees to Avoid Punishment: Yin Wenshou, the head of the Huanglu Town Security Corps in Xinfeng, had a dispute with someone in the village. Recently, a member of the clan filed a complaint with the court, stating that Yin openly smoked opium in the village and provided shelter for others to smoke. After receiving the complaint, the procuratorate summoned the reporter for questioning and ordered him to post bail. Immediately, a bailiff was secretly sent to the village to arrest Yin. Yin had already fled to Shanghai upon hearing the news. Only Yin Shijinzi, who ran an opium den for others to smoke, and opium addicts Fan Rongcai, Li Changshou, and Yin Derong were captured, along with a full set of smoking paraphernalia. They were immediately escorted by train to the city, questioned in court, and detained. It is said that they were prosecuted in the criminal court yesterday.

<p>Qingjiang</p>
<p>Bandits Rampant Again in Northwest Siyang: Siyang has always been plagued by bandits. After a crackdown by the stationed troops, the bandits' power was slightly weakened. Now, bandits are active in the northwest area of the county. The day before yesterday, a large group of bandits suddenly arrived in Zhaolizhuang, southeast of Yanghe, and kidnapped dozens of men and women, including Zhao Yushi and Li Fusheng, heading towards Jinshuo Town in the western countryside of the county. The villagers, unable to match the bandits in numbers, dared not pursue them. Furthermore, due to the wheat harvest, they could not abandon their homes and flee. It is said that District Chief Chen Yingcai has been appointed to seek troops to suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>Bandit Executed by Firing Squad: Shang Tangfa, a bandit from Henan, was arrested for kidnapping the son of his clan brother, Shang Dedi. He was handed over to the Wuxing Branch Court, which sentenced him to death. The sentence was approved by the Provincial Government, and he was executed by firing squad on the spot. At 9:00 AM today, Chief Prosecutor Pan Yinting took his seat in the courtroom, presented the bandit, verified his identity, and escorted him to the South Training Ground in the city for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>Suicide by Opium Consumption Due to Difficulty Passing the Holiday: Wang Anqing, a weaver from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 17 Majun Lane, Heshangdou, had been in a relationship with the widow Liu Zhang for many years. Wang is currently unemployed and struggling to make ends meet. He felt that he could not get through the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival and secretly consumed raw opium this morning. Liu Zhang discovered this and took him to Huzhou Hospital for treatment. However, he died shortly after due to severe poisoning. The First Public Security Bureau reported the incident to the court for investigation. The court sent Prosecutor Chen along with police officers to investigate and confirmed that the deceased had indeed died from consuming poison. He instructed Liu Zhang to properly arrange for the coffin and burial.</p>
<p>Shaoxing</p>
<p>Xiaoshan-Shaoxing Dispute Over Linpu Border Demarcation: The Shaoxing Public Security Bureau has been ordered by the province to reorganize on July 1. It is proceeding with the division of police districts. According to the organizational regulations, police districts and autonomous regions must be unified. Because Linpu Town, which is jointly administered by Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, is the autonomous region of the seventh district of Shaoxing, the town is naturally the police district of the seventh branch of the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, Director Mo went to Xiaoshan to discuss with County Magistrate Du of Xiaoshan the issue of the demarcation of the county border in Linpu Town, to resolve the reorganization. They discussed in detail at the Xiaoshan County Government, but because the two sides had different opinions, no result was achieved. Director Mo presented three reasons to advocate for its inclusion in Shaoxing, while County Magistrate Du advocated for its inclusion in Xiaoshan. It is now planned to submit a request to the Department of Civil Affairs to send personnel for a re-survey before making a final decision.</p>

<p>Two Major Fires in Cixi Southern Countryside: On the night of the 13th, a fire broke out at the home of a certain Mr. Che in Che Town, Cixi Southern Countryside, due to a grievance. The fire spread rapidly. Because the town lacked firefighting equipment, it was difficult to extinguish for a time. The fire was finally extinguished at around 3:00 AM on the 14th, destroying more than 20 stores, including Fuzhen, Xianghe, Xu Helai, Xinfumao, Chen Detai, Yihe, Wanchang, Luosenmao, Guanghe, and Zhang Hexing, totaling more than 70 houses, causing losses of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. This is truly an unprecedented major fire in the town. Also, at 3:00 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at the home of Ying Changgen, a farmer in Shenjiacao, Cixi Southern Countryside, due to carelessness with fire, also causing a blaze. It spread to more than 20 neighboring houses, causing significant losses. Changgen's grandmother, who was over 80 years old, died in bed due to old age and illness.</p>
<p>Water Police Clash with Pirates: The Sixth Patrol Team of the Zhenhai Water Police Bureau's Bingping warship, together with the Seventh Water Patrol Team, set out to rescue a Shandong shipwreck the day before yesterday. They encountered the gang of Li Ziqing pirates in the waters of Dongji Island and engaged in a gun battle. As a result, more than ten pirates were killed on the spot, and bandit Chen Xiuying was captured alive. One rifle, two shotguns, one pistol, and 25 homemade bombs were seized. One stranded fishing boat and seven refugees were rescued. Li Shifang, the patrol captain of the Water Patrol Team, and patrol officers Huang Chongxiang and Guan Jinbiao were also injured by the pirates. It is said that Huang Chongxiang died of his injuries. The rescued shipwreck and refugees have been announced by the bureau for collection.</p>
<p>Theft Occurs in Wuchiu Village: The home of Fang Alu, a resident near Wuchiu Village, Fanshidu, in Yinxian, was engaged in farming for a living and was barely making ends meet. At around 7:00 PM last night, four bandits suddenly arrived, each carrying a pistol, broke through the door, and engaged in looting. It is estimated that clothes, jewelry, silver dollars, etc. were stolen, causing losses of more than 500 yuan. Fang Alu has reported to the Purge Bureau requesting their apprehension.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Major Gambling Den Cracked Down in Zhoujiawu: Zhou Achuan's son, in Zhoujiawu, Southern Countryside, specialized in gambling at home, all night long, without any scruples. Unexpectedly, the county government learned of this the day before yesterday and sent eight officers to capture them. Zhou Zhengchang, Zhou Miaolin, Jin Zhengsheng, Wang Amao, Yu Ashou, Ge Jiuxin, Han Fengbiao, Ni Amao, Li Ruitang, Shen Ahu, Ni Aquan, and eleven others were captured and taken to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<p>Taizhou</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs in Qiansuo: The home of a merchant named Pei Jin in Qiansuo, Linhai, was suddenly invaded by more than ten robbers wielding weapons at around 12:00 AM the night before last. Seeing their fierce momentum, the family dared not resist. It is estimated that clothes, silver, jewelry, etc., worth over 1,000 yuan were stolen, and Pei Jin was kidnapped. The family has reported the incident to the relevant authorities for investigation, but it is uncertain whether they will be apprehended.</p>
<p>Adulterous Woman and Monk Kill Husband: Li, the wife of Zhang Xuezhou, a farmer in Zhaozha, Western Countryside, Tiantai, had been having an affair with Hongshun, a monk from the nearby Zhaozha Temple, for years. She regarded her husband as a thorn in her side. Now, Hongshun and Li secretly conspired to become husband and wife for a long time. The night before last, while Xuezhou was sound asleep, they used a wood axe to cut off Xuezhou's throat, killing him instantly. The two of them transported the body to a mountain bay near Zhaozha Temple that night, tied the body with a large rock, submerged it at the bottom of the pond, and fled. The next day, the corpse was discovered by the brother of the deceased, who invited his clansmen to capture Li in the Huangshui area of the village and sent her to the county government for questioning. After the trial officer Cai and the forensic officials examined the corpse, they confirmed that the throat was indeed cut off with a knife before death. The trial officer then opened court and questioned Li, who confessed without denial. He immediately ordered her detention, pending the arrest of the murderous monk for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Opinions on the Trial Curriculum Standards for Shanghai Middle Schools <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the provisional curriculum standards for junior and senior high school general courses by the Provincial Department of Education, the Shanghai Middle School under this municipality has been implementing them for a year and a half. During this period, in addition to actual implementation, teachers of each subject have held meetings to discuss them in detail multiple times. Now, the trial implementation opinions, in addition to being submitted to the Provincial Department for forwarding to the Ministry, are specifically recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Subjects and Credits</p>
<p>A. Junior High School</p>
<p>1. The number of credits required for junior high school graduation should be reduced. The reason is that if the number of credits required for junior high school graduation is 186, then there are 38 hours of class per week, plus one hour for commemoration week, totaling 39 hours. Except for Saturday afternoons when no classes are scheduled, there are seven hours of class each day, which is too heavy a load and detrimental to students' physical health and extracurricular activities. The solution is to set the number of credits required for junior high school graduation at 180. 2. It is not advisable to change English to an elective in the third year of junior high school. The reason is that, given the current situation in China, English is a common and necessary tool for junior high school students, regardless of whether they continue their studies. If they only study for two years, the foundation will not be established, and even if previous efforts are not completely wasted, it will still be insufficient. English in the third year of junior high school should be a required course, with five hours per week. 3. Trigonometry should not be listed as a required course in junior high school. The reason is that junior high school mathematics should focus on algebra and geometry. Only a general understanding of trigonometry is learned, which is of no great benefit. It would be better to allocate the time for trigonometry to algebra and geometry, thereby achieving greater results. The solution is to remove trigonometry or change it to an elective, so that algebra is changed to twelve credits and geometry is changed to eleven credits. 4. History and geography credits can be reduced. The reason is that junior high school students should pay attention to history and geography, but this type of course has no experimental teaching materials that can be expanded or contracted. Moreover, most junior high school graduates continue their studies, and senior high school still has courses in Chinese history and geography and world history and geography, so the amount of history and geography in junior high school does not need to be excessive. The solution is to change Chinese history and geography to six credits each, and world history and geography to three credits each. 5. Physiology and hygiene credits can be reduced. The reason is that junior high school physiology and hygiene still tend to be focused on common sense, and this course emphasizes practice, so more attention should be paid to training. The solution is to change physiology and hygiene to three credits. 6. Mineralogy and chemistry should still be taught separately. The reason is that mineralogy and chemistry are not impossible to teach together, but in fact, chemistry teachers may not have a deep understanding of mineralogy, which inevitably makes teaching difficult. Moreover, the outline of the chemistry course includes too few mineralogy components. The solution is to teach mineralogy and chemistry separately, with two credits each. 7. Drawing, crafts, and music credits should be reduced. The reason is that junior high school students may not all be interested in drawing, crafts, and music. If there is this required course for all three academic years, the time spent is too much, and it cannot adapt to individual personalities. The solution is to change drawing, crafts, and music to electives in the third academic year. The three courses should each be set to four credits in the first two years. 8. Party and Scout activities should be given credits. The reason is that junior high school Party and Scout activities are as important as senior high school military training. Since military training is given credits, Party and Scout activities should be given credits. The reason is that junior high school Party and Scout activities are as important as senior high school military training. Since military training is given credits, Party and Scout activities should also be given credits. The solution is to set Party and Scout activities at six credits.</p>
<p>Based on the above opinions, the list of junior high school subjects and credits is as follows: Party Principles (12 credits), Chinese (36 credits), Foreign Language (50 credits), History (9 credits), Chinese History (6 credits), World History (3 credits), Geography (9 credits), Chinese Geography (6 credits), World Geography (3 credits), Mathematics (30 credits), Arithmetic (7 credits), Algebra (12 credits), Geometry (11 credits), Natural Science (16 credits), Zoology (3 credits), Botany (3 credits), Mineralogy (2 credits), Physics and Chemistry (4 credits each), Physiology and Hygiene (3 credits), Drawing (4 credits), Music (4 credits), Crafts (4 credits), Physical Education (9 credits), Party and Scout activities (6 credits), Elective Courses (8 credits), Emphasizing vocational subjects, Total Credits: 180.</p>
<p>B. Senior High School</p>
<p>1. The number of class hours for English in the second and third grades should be increased appropriately. The reason is that the general course is preparation for further education, and sufficient time should be given to build a good foundation in language tools. The prescribed work requirements are indeed indispensable. However, because the work requirements cover a wide range, and grammar and rhetoric are not assigned separate class hours, the total of only four hours per week, or 200 minutes, is insufficient to cover all aspects and achieve proficiency. The solution is to change English to five hours per week in the second and third grades. 2. The amount of mathematics should be reduced appropriately. The reason is that senior high school students have different interests. Some are interested in mathematics, while others are not. It is inappropriate to force everyone to be the same, as it would stifle individuality. The solution is to change analytic geometry to an elective. Since junior high school trigonometry is not listed as a required course (for reasons see previous opinion), senior high school trigonometry should be changed to four credits. If repeated parts of geometry are deleted (for reasons see opinions on teaching materials and teaching), four credits will be sufficient. 3. Chinese history credits can be reduced. The reason is that students have a considerable foundation in Chinese history after graduating from junior high school, so the pace of learning Chinese history in senior high school is very fast. Based on the experience of the past year's trial, it can be taught in one year with two hours per week. The solution is to change Chinese history to four credits. 4. Biology credits can be reduced. The reason is that biology teaching materials are very complex, but the representative method can be used, and at the same time, teaching and economy can be taken into account. There is no need for five hours per week. Based on the experience of the past two years, it can be taught in one year with four hours per week. The solution is to change biology to four credits. (1) Based on the above opinions, the list of senior high school general course subjects and credits is as follows:</p>
<p>Party Principles (12 credits), Chinese (24 credits), Foreign Language (30 credits), Mathematics (14 credits), Geometry (4 credits), Trigonometry (4 credits), Advanced Algebra (6 credits), Chinese History (4 credits), Foreign History (6 credits), Chinese Geography (3 credits), Foreign Geography (3 credits), Physics (8 credits), Chemistry (8 credits), Biology (6 credits), Military Training (6 credits), Physical Education (9 credits), Elective Courses (23 credits), Total Credits: 156.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Teaching Materials and Teaching</p>
<p>A. Junior High School</p>
<p>1. English grammar should be taught separately from the reader in the third grade. The reason is that teaching the reader and grammar together is the newest principle, but based on experience, this method is suitable for the initial learning period, but not for higher grades. Because in the higher grades, more attention should be paid to the systematic aspect, and students also have this requirement and are dissatisfied with fragmented knowledge. Therefore, mixed teaching rarely achieves results in higher grades. Furthermore, from the perspective of the textbook, the textbooks compiled on the market today only add a little explanation of grammar at the end of each article, which in turn makes students' knowledge of grammar vague. The solution is that in the third grade of junior high school, there should be two hours per week dedicated to English grammar teaching, and the teaching should be linked to the reader at any time. 2. Junior high school history teaching materials should adopt the reverse narrative method. The reason is that teaching history teaching materials sequentially based on the era is sufficient to obtain an accurate sense of time, clarify concepts, and understand the signs of group evolution, but ancient historical facts are too far removed from life, and beginners easily feel bored. Because of the lack of interest, it is difficult to realize automatic research. If we start from the near and go to the far, and take a certain question for in-depth discussion, we can not only understand the origin of the evolution of historical sites, but also cultivate keen observation, thinking, and reasoning skills. The solution is to list the teaching materials in reverse order, starting with the modern, then the modern, the medieval, and the ancient, according to the teaching material outline. For example, when talking about the Chinese nation, first clarify the constituent elements of the Chinese nation and its position in the world, then the contact, growth, and assimilation of various ethnic groups, and then the origin of the nation, etc. 3. Junior high school geography teaching materials should first list the outlines of natural regionalization and political regionalization. The reason is that adopting the provincial method (or regional method) for teaching domestic geography and the country method for teaching foreign geography is rigid and impractical. However, common maps and various statistical materials cannot break the old concepts of provincial and national divisions. Moreover, to explain the location of a place clearly and accurately, regional explanations are indispensable. The application of natural regionalization or political regionalization is as necessary as latitude and longitude. Therefore, it is appropriate to first list a simple narrative to clarify the outline of all human-land relationships. The solution is to add a simple description of regionalization to the teaching material outline, and briefly describe the evolution of regionalization, the comparison of natural regions and political regions, etc., as the basis for describing natural and human phenomena.</p>
<p>B. Senior High School</p>
<p>1. English grammar should be taught separately from the reader. The reason is detailed in item 1 of section A, Junior High School. The solution is that there should be one or two hours in the first and second grades dedicated to teaching grammar. The teaching should be linked to the reader at any time. 2. Repeated parts of high school algebra and geometry and elementary algebra and elementary geometry should be deleted. The reason is that time is not economical and it hinders the higher parts. The solution is to list elementary algebra or elementary geometry formulas and theorems at the beginning of the compilation method of ordinary higher algebra, without explanation or proof, for reference. 3. Senior high school trigonometry teaching materials should be further enriched. The reason is that junior high school trigonometry teaching materials are very simple, or there is no trigonometry course at all, which seems insufficient for those who want to enter the science and engineering departments of universities in the future. The solution is to add trigonometric equations and other advanced parts in the second half. 4. High school analytic geometry should add an overview of solid analytic geometry. The reason is that junior high school only has elementary plane geometry, and high school only has a brief overview of elementary solid geometry. Students' understanding of three-dimensional concepts seems weak, which will hinder future research in advanced mathematics and physics and the drawing of mechanical drawings. Therefore, it is necessary to review solid geometry again using analytical methods. The solution is to add a chapter or two of solid analytic geometry overview after plane analytic geometry. 5. Senior high school geography courses should add natural teaching materials. The reason is that geography teaching materials focus on human aspects, but the natural environment is the basis of human phenomena, which cannot be ignored. The part about natural aspects in junior high school teaching materials is too simple and insufficient for problem research. Moreover, natural science relies heavily on geographical explanation, so there should be sufficient preparation in this course. The solution is to add several questions about natural geography to the outline of teaching materials in the domestic and foreign parts, accounting for about 20% or 30% of the total teaching materials.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Grouping</p>
<p>The general course should still be divided into arts and science groups. The reason is that the curriculum should take into account students' interests, which is one of the principles of curriculum design. In fact, high school students' interests are close to literature and science. It is inappropriate to force them to be the same, and it is not appropriate for both teachers and students to feel difficulty. If it is said that the new school system curriculum standards set by the National Education Federation in 1923 are inadequate, only the drawbacks of elective courses can be corrected, and the principle of grouping does not need to be broken. Whether it is appropriate to adopt the training doctrine is still a question. The solution is to not group in the first grade, and from the second grade onwards, still divide into arts and science groups, restrict elective courses, and form a systematic arrangement to avoid the drawbacks of general elective courses.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the Connection with Universities</p>
<p>The university entrance examination should be based on the middle school curriculum. The reason is that the middle school entrance examination standards should be connected with the primary school graduation level, and the university entrance examination standards should also be connected with the middle school graduation level. Only in this way can the drawbacks of separation be avoided. But in fact, the university entrance examination only considers from the university's own perspective, arbitrarily raising the level, and the standards set by each university are also inconsistent. Even comparing the entrance examination questions of the School of Science of Central University and the entrance examination questions of Jiaotong University, the levels are quite different. This chaotic phenomenon makes middle schools feel difficult. Now that there are Ministry-issued middle school curriculum standards, universities should be consistent and use this as a basis. The solution is for the Ministry of Education to issue a notice to all universities that future entrance examinations should be based on the Ministry-issued middle school curriculum standards to facilitate connection.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Zhang Qun Returns to Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Talks About the Recent Situation</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yuejun, who previously went north on behalf of the Central Government to offer condolences for Deputy Commander Zhang's illness, returned to Beijing on the 14th to report on his mission. Yesterday morning, Zhang returned to Shanghai. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed him at the municipal government, inquiring about the situation in Guangdong and the North. According to his conversation:</p>
<p>Deputy Commander's Illness: Deputy Commander Zhang felt unwell upon returning north and saw an increase in symptoms. Initially, he was only treated by the doctor accompanying the deputy commander. However, on the 30th of last month, he was moved to the hospital. The highest temperature reached 39 degrees Celsius. When I left Ping on the 12th, the temperature was the same as a normal person's, and his mind was also very clear. However, because his vitality had not recovered, he still needed recuperation. He may be discharged from the hospital in about a week, but after being discharged, he will either return to Shenyang for recuperation or choose another secluded place. It has not yet been determined. In short, Deputy Commander's illness has not been in any danger from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Situation in the North: Since Deputy Commander Zhang's illness in the North, all administrative and security matters have been maintained by various officials. Therefore, the Pingjin area is exceptionally peaceful. At the same time, Deputy Commander Zhang and others expressed absolute support for the telegraph issued by Chairman Chiang. Various rumors from the outside world, such as how a certain faction is active or that Shi Yousan's troops have different trends, are all inaccurate. The recent troop movements of the Northeast Army are entirely to support the Central Government and prevent local actions. Outside rumors are nothing more than unfounded speculation. Deputy Commander Zhang is extremely obedient to and supportive of the Central Government.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Guangdong: Regarding the Guangdong issue, when I met Mr. Zhang Puquan in Beijing, he said that he had met with various important figures in Guangdong during his time there. According to what each person indicated, most advocated for a political solution. As for the Central Government, it has never expressed the use of force against Guangdong or any military action but has always advocated for a peaceful resolution. The Central Government is still primarily focused on persuasion regarding the Guangdong issue, and perhaps another path to a political solution can be found in the future.</p>
<p>Suppressing Bandits: The Central Government is determined to suppress the Red bandits to eliminate the major threat. At the same time, it has ample preparations in military, political, and financial matters. Sichuan has also dispatched troops to assist the Central Government in suppressing the bandits. Commander-in-Chief Chiang will probably depart within days and proceed according to the planned bandit suppression plan. Although the communist bandits are extremely rampant, it may not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Reorganization: Mayor Zhang continued to discuss the reorganization of the municipal government. He said that since the National Government announced the new organizational law of the municipal government, the detailed organizational rules of this city have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and are scheduled to take effect on July 1. There will be no changes to the departments and personnel of the municipal government after the reorganization in the future.</p>
<p>Staff Transfers: He also said that Municipal Government Counselor Xi Dingmo, after being appointed by the Ministry of Communications as the Shanghai Maritime Administration Director, came to the municipal government to resign this afternoon (16th). I have approved it, and his vacancy will be filled by Municipal Government Secretary Zhou Liangcai.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Domestic Goods Bazaar Unwilling to Open Automatically <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Persuasion to Resume Business Fails</p>
<p>The Result Must Await Today's Negotiations</p>
<p>The China National Products United Bazaar has been closed for eight days after being ordered to shut down by the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council has allowed the business to resume, but the bazaar is unwilling to open automatically. Party and government agencies are preparing to discuss solutions within days. The bazaar's negotiation committee is scheduled to meet today to discuss the matter. The situation yesterday is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Takes Action: The Industrial and Commercial Visiting Bureau of the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to negotiate with Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Municipal Council. As a result, the bazaar was allowed to resume business. However, after the resumption of business, the equipment in the amusement department must be improved. Later, because the bazaar was unwilling to open automatically, the negotiation process was reported to the ministry by telegram yesterday and consulted with Zhao Tiezhang, the section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, preparing to consult with representatives from the municipal government, the municipal chamber of commerce, the municipal party department, and the social affairs bureau to discuss solutions within the possible scope.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Negotiations: Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, sent a letter to Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, to lodge a serious protest. The original letter is recorded below: To Mr. Fessenden: It was reported yesterday by the China National Products United Bazaar that at 3:00 PM on June 9th, the public concession police suddenly dispatched many Chinese and Western officers, armed and went to the bazaar, closing all the gates and ordering it to shut down. According to the established precedent of Wing On, an amusement department was added upstairs in order to develop the business. However, the Municipal Council created various difficulties regarding the license for the amusement department. Afterwards, a seven-year contract was signed with the landlord. How could the Municipal Council refuse to issue a license, claiming that the building was not suitable for running a bazaar, when it was requested for license application and renovation? As a last resort, they moved to No. 4 Jing'an Temple Road on May 5, thinking that the New World amusement park was a place for entertainment, and all the equipment should comply with the regulations of the bureau, and there would be no more objections. However, after the move, difficulties continued as before. Otherwise, why would the same amusement park, before the bazaar moved, when the New World was running, never have been ordered to do so? Since the venue is located in the concession, they had no choice but to obey the orders and comply with them. Unexpectedly, on June 9th, there was another move to close the entire venue and order it to shut down. The excuse was nothing more than the license issue. However, since the bazaar has no need to obtain a license and there are no violations, why was it also closed? Furthermore, the bazaar staff were illegally beaten and injured by the police and arrested and detained. All the injured persons have reported to the Special District Court to verify the injuries. Please find a way to negotiate. According to this, the Social Affairs Bureau investigated the whole matter and reported it back, which is roughly the same as the previous situation. It is difficult to understand that your Municipal Council suddenly ordered the entire bazaar to shut down and closed it because of the license issue of the amusement department attached to the bazaar. Moreover, it did not request permission from the court in advance and executed the closure rashly, which was a fundamental mistake. This measure not only hinders our national legal rights but also violates the agreement on the Chinese courts in the Shanghai Public Concession. If it is not corrected urgently, it will make the residents of the Special District feel that they cannot enjoy legal protection. Who will be responsible if a misunderstanding occurs? According to the previous report, in addition to the losses suffered by the bazaar, which should be directly requested for relief according to law by the bazaar, a serious protest is hereby lodged. Please investigate and reply. Respectfully, to Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Wu Jingxiong's Letter: Mr. Wu Jingxiong, a municipal councilor of the Municipal Council, replied to the letter from the Manufacturers' Federation yesterday, saying: To all gentlemen of the Manufacturers' Federation of the National Products United Bazaar, I have received your letter and fully understood everything. I have been entrusted to uphold justice in this closure of the bazaar, which is related to the public interest, and I should do my best. Xiong has always advocated for justice in serving the community, and I will still do my best in this matter to find a solution in order to reach a mutual understanding and restore the original state. I am writing to inform you of this first, and I will continue with the details later. I wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Resumption of Business Pending: At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the Municipal Council specially sent Police Chief Mao Ding, along with a police officer No. 209 from the New Gate Police Station, the leader of the Fire Brigade, and six people, including an interpreter, to the bazaar in person. Mr. Dong Juesun, a negotiator from the bazaar, came out to meet them and accompanied them to inspect various places in the venue, instructing the bazaar to open for business today (16th) before 2:00 PM. The amusement department can also operate after the fire brigade approves it. First, they went to inspect the Peking Opera venue. According to them, the area of ​​this stage is too large and does not comply with the regulations. Mr. Dong replied that this stage has been performing Peking Opera for more than ten years. Even on the last day of the New World's final transfer (April 30), "Journey to the West" was still performed, with mountain and water firework scenery. Why did the Municipal Council not interfere? Mao Ding said that the license given by the Municipal Council for this stage specifies (Sing Song Stage) a singing license, not a Peking Opera license. Mr. Dong replied, but the former New World performed "Journey to the West" on this stage until April 30. The playbill was published daily, and advertisements were published in various newspapers, including Shen Bao and Xin Bao, and the police and firefighters stationed by the Municipal Council all witnessed it, and the patrolling police officers also came to the venue to observe from time to time. Now, the Municipal Council suddenly blames this venue for not complying with the regulations and ordered it to shut down, which is incomprehensible. Moreover, according to my knowledge, the stages for performing Peking Opera in various amusement parks that have been licensed by the Municipal Council cannot meet the size stipulated by the Municipal Council. Can you point to a place and go to measure it? Mao Ding said that this is not my task to come here today. My task is to order the bazaar to open today. Mr. Dong said, on June 9, the New Gate Police Station came to seal the door with only the order of the chief patrol officer, without any formal official documents. Today, there are no official documents, but they still come with orders to open the door. If someone tomorrow orders the door to be closed again with the order of the chief patrol officer or the chief director, then there will be nowhere to turn. Moreover, since the door has been closed, before it is clear who is responsible for closing the door, it is not convenient to open the door easily. Mao Ding and others wanted to open the door themselves and leave, but because the door was locked, they ordered Mr. Dong to take the key and open it. Mr. Dong said that the lock on this door was also locked by the police who sealed the door, and the key is now kept by the negotiation committee. I am afraid that no one will dare to advocate opening the door before the negotiation is resolved. Mao Ding and others had no choice but to go to the Taiping Gate on Tibet Road. Ten minutes later, Western police officer No. 209 came again, wanting to meet with Mr. Zhang Zilian, the manager of the bazaar. Since Mr. Zhang had already gone out, he asked Mr. Dong to notify him by telegram when Mr. Zhang came back so that he could come to meet him and ask him to open the door today and explain the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Continued Negotiations: At 8:00 PM last night, the venue received a phone call from Mr. Hong Yanbin, saying that the chief patrol officer would visit the bazaar with two Chinese directors, Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, at 10:00 AM today to discuss solutions. It was also learned that the National Products Bazaar Negotiation Committee, because the Municipal Council knew it was in the wrong after the Ministry of Industry's Negotiation Committee sent personnel to negotiate, allowed the National Products Bazaar to resume business. Therefore, it was decided to convene all members of the Negotiation Committee at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the negotiation process. The members had many suggestions, which will be submitted for discussion at the meeting.</p>
<p>Assistance from All Parties: More than 100 groups, including the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the dockworkers' union, the silk reeling workers' union, and the cigarette workers' union, all issued declarations yesterday to assist the National Products Bazaar in the case of being ordered to shut down by the Municipal Council. Furthermore, groups such as the Hangzhou National Goods Factory Federation, the Penglai Market Commercial Research Association, and the Shaoxing Wine Industry Guild all telegraphed the National Government's Ministry of Industry yesterday, requesting them to uphold justice and pledging to provide backing.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Foreign Ships Seize Navigation Rights Amidst the Sichuan River Shipping Tide <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants' Shipping Association Broken by Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Freight Rates Skyrocket by Twofold</p>
<p>In the past month, the Sichuan River shipping industry has been embroiled in a major storm due to foreign merchants seeking to monopolize the shipping industry and Chinese ships forming an alliance to counter them, with both sides exerting all their efforts. This matter has been reported in this newspaper twice. However, the turn of events was unexpected. Just as the Chinese ships were beginning to unite and cooperate with merchant guilds and labor unions, a sudden change occurred within a week. The joint organization of eight Chinese shipping companies and industrial and commercial circles has been broken by foreign merchants. This has led to a surge in freight rates and a major wave of strikes by Chinese merchants. This matter concerns the survival of Sichuan River shipping rights. The reporter went to various parties to investigate in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Breaking the Chinese Ship Alliance: Eight Chinese shipping companies on the Sichuan River, including China Merchants, Sanbei, Zhongxing, Shuping, Yujiang, Yongqing, and Chuanjiang, united last month with eight groups, including passenger gangs, customs declaration barge companies, and packaging machinery companies, to form a business transportation association, advocating for the transportation of national goods on national ships and refusing to load foreign ships. It was formally established on June 1. Foreign merchants learned of this matter and urgently sought to destroy it. Unable to influence Yichang, they went to Chongqing. News came yesterday that the Chongqing Business Transportation Association had been influenced by foreigners, allowing foreign merchant ships to join the association. Since June 6, this association, which had been painstakingly managed by various Chinese ships, has been completely broken by foreigners. The name of the association has already been changed to the Sino-Foreign Business Transportation Association. The Chinese people's advocacy for reclaiming Sichuan River shipping rights has also been fundamentally shattered.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Skyrocket Freight Rates: After foreign merchants devised a plan to obtain Sichuan River transportation rights, they convened a meeting on June 6 with the eight Chinese shipping companies and the eight industrial and commercial transportation groups in the association, saying that there were fewer goods and more ships on the Yichang-Chongqing route, and the freight rates for upstream and downstream had been reduced several times to the minimum limit. Cotton yarn, one piece, only costs two taels, which is not enough to cover the cost of each ship. They proposed a plan to increase freight rates, increasing the charge for each piece of cotton yarn by six taels from the 6th, an increase of two times the current rate.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Oppose Reducing Voyages: Representatives of various Chinese ships also requested that, at a time when there is a shortage of goods upstream and downstream, there are more than 30 ships operating on the Sichuan River, but only eight are Chinese ships, and the rest are foreign ships. In order to maintain the momentum, voyages should be reduced, and each shipping company should not have more than two ships. Unexpectedly, this plan was opposed by various foreign merchants (because each foreign shipping company has six or seven ships or eight or nine ships), who did not allow the reduction of ships, but only allowed limiting the loading capacity of each ship to only half the number of goods per voyage. If any private overloading is found, a heavy fine will be imposed, and private price reductions are not allowed. If cotton yarn freight rates are found to have been privately reduced by less than six yuan, the ship's operation will be suspended for one month. With the implementation of this plan, Chinese ships have entered a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Merchant Gangs Strike to Resist: After the meeting of the Sino-Foreign Business Transportation Association decided on and announced the plan, the merchant gangs in Sichuan were all shocked. According to this plan, Chinese ships on the Sichuan River only account for one-fourth of foreign ships and are bound by their restrictions, which has already fallen into a desperate situation. From now on, the shipping industry in Sichuan will be completely controlled by foreign ships. In the future, freight rates will inevitably continue to rise. Having just acquired transportation rights, freight rates have already increased twofold. The suffering of the Sichuan gangs in the future is unknown. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to stop transporting and loading in order to save the situation. The Sanbei Company in this city received this alarm and urgently telegraphed Chongqing, ordering the Dangyang ship to stop operating and return to Shanghai, and the China Merchants Bureau's Emei ship also stopped sailing, and a new plan was being made.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Truth About the Yu Da Ship Collision <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Talks with the Crew of the Yu Ji</p>
<p>The sinking of the British submarine Poseidon by the Yu Da, a vessel managed by the Hai Chang Yu Da Company, has been reported in this newspaper several times. Yesterday, the company's Yu Ji ship arrived in Shanghai from Yingkou. According to the personnel in charge of the ship, the responsibility for the Yu Da ship's sinking of the British warship lies entirely with the British submarine, because it was navigating in the wrong channel. On the afternoon of the 9th, when the Yu Da arrived at Chengshanjiao, it was traveling according to the correct channel, while the British warship Poseidon was approaching from the side, not emerging from the seabed. The Yu Da sounded its horn when it spotted the British warship, in accordance with regulations for mutual avoidance, and there would have been no danger. However, when the two ships were close to each other, the Yu Da suddenly veered outwards to give way, but the British warship suddenly changed direction, its hull suddenly crossing the Yu Da's path, making it impossible for the Yu Da to avoid or yield. The bow of the Yu Da crashed into the waist of the British submarine, causing the accident and its sinking. The captain and six other crew members were rescued by the Yu Da and went to the Weihaiwei Customs to report the incident. The Yu Da captain acknowledged the collision and signed a confirmation. The Poseidon captain also acknowledged at the customs that he had traveled in the wrong channel, resulting in the collision, and stated that the responsibility lay with his ship, unrelated to the Yu Da, also signing for responsibility. The Yu Da has now sailed from Yingkou and will arrive in Shanghai today, docking at the Yangjiadu China Merchants Wharf. Nine British warships are currently searching the sea where the British submarine sank for corpses and planning salvage methods.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Labor-Management Agreement on Wage Issues at Silk Factories <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Mutual Understanding, Proposing a Compromise</p>
<p>Wuxi Precedent: 57 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th) at 3 PM, the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association held a joint labor-management meeting to discuss the issue of female workers' wages. Attendees included representatives from the management side: Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Peishen, Dr. Shi, Zhang Yunsheng, Tang Yeqin, Xu Yunjiang, Tang Bingqian, and others; and representatives from the labor side: Xu Meiqin, Yang Gengdi, Wu Suzhen, Yuan Yunlong (representing the Special District), Zhang Jinsen, Chen Xiufu, Zhu Xizhang, Dong Xingen, Le Xiaorong (representing the Eastern District), and over twenty others. Shen Huachen was unanimously elected as chairman. Following formalities, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the downturn in the foreign silk market has reached its peak. Overseas Japanese silk is being sold at low prices, increasingly impacting the market. Shanghai's white silk prices have plummeted, and the market sluggishness is unprecedented in the last twenty years. Last winter, the price of medium-grade silk dropped to over 700 taels, causing severe losses for factories, leading to wage reductions and factory shutdowns. Subsequently, the Social Affairs Bureau, aiming to maintain the livelihoods of workers, convened meetings between labor and management representatives, resulting in a resolution to reduce wages by 15%, from 60 cents per workday to 51 cents. An agreement was signed, stipulating that after the new silk season began on June 1st of the 20th year (i.e., this year), the issue of wage increases would be re-evaluated based on the market situation and silk prices. It was not guaranteed that wages would be restored upon expiration. Furthermore, the European and American silk markets remain sluggish. In previous years, the price of medium-grade silk was over 1,100 taels at the start of the new silk season. This year, however, there is little new silk being offered, and the price of medium-grade silk is only over 800 taels. The domestic cocoon yield is exceptionally poor. Statistics indicate that the cocoon production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces can, at most, supply silk factories for four months of reeling. The quality of the cocoons is uneven, with more inferior cocoons than superior ones. Cocoon prices are remarkably high, reaching 100 yuan for foreign breeds in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other areas. With a shortage of raw materials and high cocoon prices, the factories are facing increasing hardship and have been forced to announce a complete shutdown. Given the current situation, even the current wage of 51 cents per workday for female workers is difficult to sustain, and there is no possibility of wage increases. The chairman appealed to the labor representatives to understand the hardships faced by the management, in the spirit of sincere labor-management cooperation. Following this, labor representative Yuan Yunlong stated that last year, due to the poor silk market, factories requested wage reductions. At the time, workers, recognizing the factories' operating losses, willingly endured the pain and expressed their utmost sincerity by accepting the 15% wage reduction agreement. In the past, factories had only increased wages by two or three cents at most, but the labor side agreed to a nine-cent reduction in one go, because management was on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, in the spirit of labor-management cooperation, they sincerely accepted the agreement. Once the term expired, the factories would naturally restore wages as agreed, allowing workers to maintain their livelihoods. Thus, even when the foreign silk market turned around and the silk price rose to 1,000 taels, the labor side did not object. Now that the silk price has reached over 900 taels, and the term of the wage reduction agreement signed last year has expired, the original wages should be restored as agreed to maintain the livelihoods of workers. Moreover, silk factories in Wuxi have already resumed paying the old wages from the first of this month. Therefore, the labor side is very resolute in demanding the restoration of wages and is determined to achieve this goal. It is hoped that the management will understand the suffering endured by the workers over the past seven months due to the wage reduction and will immediately follow last year's agreement to restore wages. Subsequently, female workers like Le Xiaorong stood up one after another to express the plight of the workers. Chairman Shen proposed to increase the female workers' wages to 57 cents, following the Wuxi method, as a compromise. He requested a vote, but the labor representatives believed that this matter concerned the interests of all workers, and they could not make a decision without consulting them. They would report the situation of today's meeting to all workers, seek their consent, and then request the Association to convene a large labor-management conference for a public decision. The meeting adjourned, and it was already past 7 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Wang Bao's Wedding Tomorrow <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Both Sides Have Very Harmonious Opinions</p>
<p>Unlimited Family Happiness is Assured</p>
<p>The engagement of Minister of Communications Wang Boqun to Miss Bao Zhining has been announced in various newspapers with the consent of both families. However, the details of Wang and Bao's marriage have not been fully disclosed in various newspapers, and there have been some inaccuracies in the rumors, which have attracted much attention. A reporter from this newspaper specially interviewed a friend close to Minister Wang yesterday. According to him, the matter had been under consideration by both parties for more than ten months and was completely finalized last month. Miss Bao is from Nantong and is the eldest daughter of Bao Jitong, the current Consul in Melbourne, USA. She is also the niece of Bao Jiyin of the Ministry of Finance and Bao Junjian, the former Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau. She graduated from the College of Liberal Arts of Shanghai Great China University and was an excellent student in school. Teachers and students in the school praised her character. Last year, a friend of the Bao family happened to mention Miss Bao's marriage. At that time, Wang Boqun's original wife had passed away several years ago, and he had not remarried. Madame Wang was looking for a successor. Wang and Miss Bao's uncle were old friends, so Zhang Wohua and He Jiwu mentioned the marriage, believing that they were well-matched in terms of social status and talent. At that time, Miss Bao's father, Bao Jitong, had just returned from his post as Consul General in Canada. He stated that since both the man and woman had considerable status and knowledge, marriage should respect the opinions of both parties. However, the orders of parents and the basis of law cannot be ignored. After a long period of discussion, it was determined that since Wang was formally remarrying, there were no legal issues. The opinions of both parties were also very harmonious, and an engagement was made at the beginning of the month. Various rumors circulating before were not true and were not credible. It is now heard that Wang and Bao have agreed to hold a formal wedding ceremony at the Xu Garden in Shanghai on the 18th of this month. It is noted that both the Wang and Bao families are prominent families, and Minister Wang is a pillar of the Party and the country, while Miss Bao is a young talent. In the future, they will definitely be a good match and have unlimited family happiness. They will also be able to spare no effort in promoting the cause of the country. It is expected that the wedding ceremony will be a lively affair.</p>

<p>Reports from Various Provinces Account for 70-80%</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously received instructions from the Executive Yuan to register Russian ruble currency in order to collect the total amount and propose it to Russia as the price for redeeming the railway. After receiving the order, the Federation repeatedly telegraphed the national chambers of commerce, actively registering and reporting the matter. According to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday, most of the stored banknotes in Shanghai have been registered. However, due to the long distance of outlying areas, reports have only come in from 70-80% of the areas. The Federation has decided to end the registration period at the end of this month. Any holders of banknotes in Shanghai who have not yet registered can report to the Federation immediately.</p>

<p>Killing Infants for Amusement</p>
<p>Naked Women Paraded Through the Streets</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross recently received a telegram from Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Provincial Relief Commission, requesting prompt relief due to the suffering caused by the communist bandits. The details mentioned in the telegram are unbearable to hear and are disclosed below: Original telegram: Chinese Red Cross Charity Committee, Henan Province has suffered disasters for many years, which has been a concern for both domestic and foreign countries. The central government has allocated large sums of money, and various charitable organizations have generously donated to rescue the disaster victims, which is uncountable. Since the beginning of the year, it was assumed that the two wheat crops would be abundant and alleviate the people's suffering. However, the disasters have only increased. Guangluo, Gushang, and other counties have long been ravaged by communist bandits, burning, killing, raping, and occupying everything. The refugees gathered at the various stations in Xinyang, begging for food and lodging, homeless and on their last breath, eagerly waiting for rescue. Those who fled to Wuhan and Wanying reached tens of thousands, with deaths and displacements, in a miserable state. The heads of the bandits, Cui Erdan and Wei Guowang, were severely suppressed by the large army and retreated to the mountains in Song County and Nanzhao, burning and killing countless people. Recently, they invaded Nanyang, setting fire to the northeast and killing thousands of people. Over 10,000 people were taken hostage. Fortunately, the reinforcements arrived and relieved the siege. On May 30th, they captured Tanghe, gathered hundreds of infants, smashed their brains and abdomen, and used it for amusement. Naked women were paraded through the streets during the day. The burning and killing were unprecedented. Although the people tried to escape, how could they survive? According to the investigations, the people waiting for relief need immediate help. Unfortunately, the relief funds are exhausted, and there is no one to provide relief. Every time I hear the simple words, I feel helpless. I beg you to show mercy and provide prompt relief, allocating large sums of money to rescue the refugees. I implore you on behalf of the millions of disaster victims. I beg you to consider it. Chairman Zhang Zhihui of the Henan Provincial Relief Commission.</p>

(3) Authorities mediate: The Guanghua Factory labor dispute case was handled by Zhou Funong from the Municipal Party Committee's People's Training Committee and Xu Ti from the Social Affairs Bureau. They summoned them for questioning on the 13th. It is now heard that the Social Affairs Bureau will formally mediate today.</p>

<h3 id="e70">A Man Dies After Jumping From a Building <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Must Be a Kidnapped Victim</p>
<p>No One Inside, Only Weapons</p>
<p>At 4:45 PM the day before yesterday, a man about 40 years old jumped from the third-floor window at the back door of house number 2, Lane 40, Julieda Road, French Concession. He fell and was injured, unconscious. Many pedestrians gathered to watch, and there were many opinions, but the reason for the jump was unknown. No one came out of the house to see. After the patrolmen learned of the matter, they rushed to the scene and took the man to the Lujiawan police station. After the head of the police station determined that the injuries were serious, he ordered the man to be taken to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, Bai Erde, a Western detective from the special agency of the French police station, together with detectives Jin Jiulin, Li Yaolong, Qian Yumin, Mao Jingen, Zhang Yuying, and Bao Tan Wang Licheng rushed to the house to investigate. They did not hear of any man dying after jumping from the building.</p>
<p>The furniture in the living room was ordinary wooden furniture. In the second floor room, there was an iron bed. Two pistols and thirteen bullets (one with six bullets and one with seven bullets) were found under the pillow, along with military commission documents and other documents. There were three floor mats on the third floor. From this, it can be inferred that the person who jumped from the building was probably a kidnapped victim, and the house was a bandit den. The victim took advantage of the bandit's carelessness and tried to escape by jumping from the window, resulting in the injury. The bandits saw the victim jumping from the window and escaping, and took the opportunity to escape from the front door. The head of the detective took the pistols and other items back to the police station for verification. The man died of his internal injuries not long after entering the hospital. The hospital notified the police station, and detectives were dispatched to take the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. After investigation, there were no relatives in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the criminal section of the French General Police Station reported to Judge Zhu of the French Court to come to the hall to examine the body. Ascending to his official position, Zhu ordered an examination and determined that the unnamed man who had died was indeed killed by falling to escape. There were no relatives. The Tongren Fuyuan Hall will provide a coffin for burial, pending relatives to claim the body. The police station was ordered to take photos of the body for filing. The body was of medium height, with a shaved head, wearing a white undershirt, white bamboo cloth pants, white socks, and no shoes. The skin was white and clean, appearing to be a person from the literary or business world. Now, the photo of the body is attached to the front for relatives to identify the face and claim the body.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Thugs Burst into the Catholic Church and Stabbed a French Priest <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Old Priest in Critical Condition</p>
<p>A Suspect Has Been Detained</p>
<p>At 9:03 PM the night before last (the 15th), an old French priest, Mr. Lebiboul, also known as Lang Benren in Chinese, was suddenly stabbed in several vital areas with a sharp blade by thugs while he was sound asleep in the Dongjiadu Catholic Church. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Lang Benren took over the position of priest in the Dongjiadu Catholic Church after the original priest, Dean Bian, left in the 17th year of the Republic of China. Although he had white hair, he was very energetic and amiable in his interactions with people, so the parishioners and neighbors were happy to associate with him. He has been in office for three years and is now 62 years old. His bedroom is on the second floor on the left side of the church. Looking out of the window, the garden below is clearly visible. He liked it very much. Unexpectedly, that night, while he was sleeping soundly, a thug sneaked in to commit the crime. According to the rules of the church, the main door must be closed at 8:30 PM every night. The keeper will hand the key to Mr. Lang, and then turn off the lights and go to bed.</p>
<p>At the time of the incident, a loud shout was suddenly heard in the silent church, as if he was fighting with a robber and begging for help. It lasted for a long time before it stopped. The priest Zhang (Bingzhuo) and the servant in the church heard the sound and went upstairs, each with a flashlight, to investigate the corridor. They saw that the door of Mr. Lang's bedroom was wide open. So they turned on the lights and went inside to investigate. They only saw that the bed curtains and bedding covered Mr. Lang's sleeping body, all stained with fresh blood. There were also drops of blood on the floor, still red and warm. Mr. Lang closed his eyes tightly, leaning tiredly on the pillow, wounded and unconscious, unable to speak.</p>
<p>The crowd was surprised and at a loss as to what to do. Priest Zhang immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau of District One, Precinct One, and Director Xu quickly led Officer Zhang and Inspector Liao of the First District General Office to investigate. They immediately closed the main door and searched inside, not allowing anyone to enter or leave. The main door was heavily guarded.</p>
<p>Suddenly, traces of blood were found from the corridor outside Mr. Lang's bedroom, all the way downstairs to the iron fence on the west side of the main door of the hall. A three-inch long sharp knife, also covered in blood, was found in the garden. Director Xu believed that the perpetrator must have been hiding in the hall in advance, and dared to commit violence only when it was late at night. However, the search continued until yesterday morning, and the perpetrator was not found. The silent church still stood tall and solemnly in the prosperous area.</p>
<p>After Mr. Lang was injured, he was taken to Guangci Hospital in the French Concession for treatment. He had four stab wounds in the shoulders, arms, and other parts of his body. His condition was critical. If he can regain consciousness, he can still be saved. Precinct One, District One, has obtained clues and learned that Qin Wenbin (a former servant of the church) from Pudong is a major suspect. They have dispatched police to Pudong last night at 1:00 AM to arrest him in the Chuansha County.</p>

<p>Higher Court Division Rejects Appeal</p>
<p>Transferred to Songjiang for Trial</p>
<p>Xu Yabo, former chief of the water police district, was suspected by the incumbent chief Xu Pucheng of involvement with the executed Tai Bao Ashu and Zhu Quan Amei, etc. Chief Xu notified the relevant police station, and more than ten suspects were arrested at Xu's residence on Tongfu Road. After being sent to the Special District Court for trial, Chief Xu prepared a document requesting their transfer. The police station opposed this, intending to have the court handle the case. After repeated hearings, it was decided that Xu Yabo should be transferred to the Songjiang County government for trial, and he was to remain in police custody during the appeal period. Xu and the police station expressed dissatisfaction with this decision and filed an appeal, as reported previously. It has now been learned that Xu's appeal was rejected by the Second Jiangsu Higher Court Division the day before yesterday. Consequently, Xu is understandably anxious in prison. He notified his younger brother and secretly sent a trusted aide to his home in Minhang around 10 AM the day before yesterday, to steal the remaining firearms and clothing from his tenure. Just as they were unloading the boat, they were discovered by detectives from the First Water Police District. They reported to Chief Xu Pucheng, who immediately dispatched armed soldiers to Xu's home, where they seized two large boxes of bullets, three Mauser rifles, one pistol, and hundreds of sets of military uniforms. Xu's trusted aide, identified as Mr. Jia, was also temporarily detained at the district headquarters, pending investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Apprentice Lies About Kidnapping <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Attempting to Defraud Employer of 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>An Amusing Account of the Incident</p>
<p>Zhongyi Hospital at No. 780 Zhejiang Road hired an apprentice named Wu Boping last month. He is a local. He suddenly went missing on the 7th of this month. Hospital owner Zhao Zhongren reported to the police station, requesting an investigation. Initially, there were no clues. Two days later, Zhao received a letter by post, which he opened and found to be from Wu. It stated that on the afternoon of the 7th, five bandits impersonated his uncle and invited him away, resulting in his imprisonment in a bandit den where he suffered greatly. He pleaded for a loan of 2,000 yuan to be delivered to No. 4 Xiafei Road on the 11th, to secure his release. After reading this, Zhao reported to the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched detective Yan Heng to investigate as scheduled. No one was found. The day before yesterday morning, Wu suddenly returned by car, dressed in tattered clothes. Zhao questioned him in detail. Wu claimed that he had indeed been kidnapped and held near Bansongyuan. He said that he managed to escape while the bandits guarding him were asleep, and that he had told the police everything he had been through. Zhao found his story suspicious and inquired of the rickshaw puller who had served Wu, who stated that he had been hired by Wu at the Great World. Thus, Wu's lies were exposed. Zhao then sent Wu to the police station for investigation. Wu could not hide the truth and confessed. He had gone to Xin Xin Company alone on the 7th and met a man named Chen Qinghe at the Daxijing performance area. He was invited to Chen's home at No. 197 Xintangjia Lane for the night. The next day, Chen instructed him to send a letter to his employer, falsely claiming that he had been kidnapped by bandits in an attempt to defraud him of 2,000 yuan. Detectives then arrested Chen Qinghe. Yesterday morning, both were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Shen Shumu presided over the trial. Wu was sentenced to three months of imprisonment, and Chen was sentenced to six months, as a warning.</p>

After a short time, she showed signs of fear and made strange noises, appearing to have a mental disorder. She remained silent for three hours, before suddenly saying, "I want to die." The police officers recognized a Ningbo accent and dispatched Detective Wu Rongsheng to send her to the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai at 2 PM. After getting into a rickshaw, she saw a car approaching and jumped out, attempting to collide with it.

<h3 id="e75">Three Deaths in Western Shanghai <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Crushed to Death... Drowned... Electrocuted</p>
<p>The area west of Shanghai, including Caojiadu, Zhoujiaqiao, Xiaoshadu, and the Tanzigou Zhongshan Road area, is vast, remote, and sparsely populated, with a mix of people from all walks of life. The police force is limited, making it difficult to effectively maintain order. Fortunately, Chief Ren of the Sixth District has implemented strict security measures at various key points, so cases of theft have been rare recently. However, in the past week, several incidents of murder, being crushed to death, and electrocution have occurred in various parts of the Sixth District, resulting in the deaths of nine people, which is unusual. These include: (1) On the 9th of this month, farmer Hong Renzheng from the Xu Family Residence on Zhongshan Road was shot and killed. (2) On the same day, an unidentified male corpse was found in the small creek inside the culvert at No. 23 Zhongshan Road, also shot and killed. (3) On the 10th of this month, Jiang Yipin, a worker at the Rihua Yarn Factory on Laobesheng Road, fell from an elevator and died. (4) On the 11th of this month, an unidentified male corpse, strangled to death, was found in the small creek inside the culvert at No. 25 Zhongshan Road. (5) On the same day, five-year-old Cao Jingen from Dingjiaku was crushed to death by a cargo truck. (6) The day before yesterday, an unidentified male corpse, stabbed to death in four places, was found behind the Xiaoshadu Tanbei Lime Mill. The above six cases have already been detailed in this newspaper. The following is a report of the three cases that occurred the day before yesterday:</p>
<p>Woman Crushed to Death by Train: At around 8:30 PM the day before yesterday, Ms. Yu Zhu, a 25-year-old woman residing in the Caoguonei area of the Xiaoshadu Lime Mill in western Shanghai, had a quarrel with her husband, Yu Tonggan. In a fit of anger, she ran out alone. While attempting to cross the tracks at the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway near Wangjia Lane in Tanbei, due to the dimness of the evening and being disoriented, she was struck by a train traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou. She was knocked down by the train and her head and legs were crushed, resulting in instant death. Her father, Yu Rongxiang, and her son, Yu Tonggan, inspected the body the night before last. The corpse was a bloody mess, a horrific sight. They immediately reported the incident to the Sixth District Police Station, which instructed the local bailiff to report to the court for an inspection.</p>
<p>Male Corpse in Small Creek: At around 7:25 PM the day before yesterday, a male corpse suddenly floated up in the small creek behind the Shenxin Yarn Factory in Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai. Someone spotted it and reported it to the Second Sub-Station of the Sixth District. Officer Wei went to investigate and found that the corpse was completely naked, around twenty years old, and appeared to be a worker. According to nearby residents, someone was seen swimming in the creek at around 4 PM that afternoon. It is believed that they drowned due to the hot weather and lack of swimming skills. The police were instructed to investigate and notify the family of the deceased for further investigation.</p>
<p>Electrician's Apprentice Electrocuted: Wu Jisan, an apprentice floor sweeper, around 20 years old from Shandong, was sweeping up dirt in the cloth weaving room of the Shenxin Yarn Factory in Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai at around 4:10 AM the day before yesterday. He accidentally touched a wire, causing him to be electrocuted and fall to the ground. He was numb all over. Workers saw this and immediately tried to rescue him, but it was too late. He died instantly. The factory notified his family, who came and took the body back for burial.</p>

<p>Prostitute Only Cares About Money</p>
<p>Old Hubei Feels Betrayed, Kills Lover</p>
<p>In the Zhide Lane, No. 8 Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, is a brothel run by a madam from Jiangxi. One of the prostitutes, Jin Ying, is 22 years old and from Jiangxi. She is of average appearance, and her business is not bad. Last month, Jin received a patron nicknamed Old Hubei, who stayed with her for over a month, spending over a thousand yuan. Recently, his money ran out, and Jin became increasingly cold towards him. The madam also demanded that he pay before staying. Yesterday (the 16th), at around 3 AM, Jin had taken in a previous regular patron. Old Hubei also arrived, but Jin did not show him any affection and gave him a cold look. Old Hubei was furious and went outside to hide an eight-inch-long sharp knife, waiting outside Jin's back door (Jin usually entered and exited through the back door of Renmei Lane). Jin went out for a snack and was spotted by Old Hubei. He called Jin a heartless and ungrateful whore. Jin also responded with harsh words. Old Hubei then stabbed Jin violently in the abdomen with the knife and fled. Jin was quite strong. Although the knife was stabbed into her abdomen, she pulled it out and cried for help. Blood gushed out like a fountain, and she fell to the ground in pain. The madam rushed over and saw Jin holding her abdomen wound with one hand, blood still flowing out. She could not speak. The madam took Jin to Renji Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police, asking them to apprehend the murderer.</p>

<p>Starring Chen Feinong, Liang Shaofeng, and Others</p>
<p>The Cantonese Opera New Spring Troupe, organized by famous Cantonese opera performers Chen Feinong, Liang Shaofeng, Yi Qiushui, Feng Xiaofei, etc., has been performing in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places. They have been very well-received, with tickets selling for up to five yuan and still having a full house. This time, they are coming to Shanghai to perform famous operas at the Guangdong Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road, with tickets selling for only two yuan and fifty cents. As a result, the audience is extremely crowded. The female lead, Chen Feinong, is known as the "Mei Lanfang of Guangdong." She has a charming appearance, a natural singing voice, and delicate expressions. She comes from a wealthy family; her father was a high-ranking official in the Qing Dynasty. She is an amateur performer turned professional and has become increasingly proficient in her studies. Liang Shaofeng is the male lead, and his reputation is similar to that of Jiang Miaoxiang. It is said that Chen's salary for the Cantonese opera season in Shanghai is as high as 28,000 yuan per month, which shows the value of her art. The organization of Cantonese opera is very similar to that of Peking opera, but the costumes, music, and singing have their own unique spirit. The plays and lyrics are particularly elegant and worthy of recitation. It is hoped that the people of Shanghai can take the time to listen to Cantonese opera and gain new knowledge in the field of drama.</p>

<p>Summary Translation of the Fourth and Fifth Sections</p>
<p>Note: The Second Volume Report includes the Fourth and Fifth Sections of this report. This summary mainly extracts and summarizes the key content of the Fifth Section, discussing "Key Issues Concerning the Future of the Public Concession." Regarding the content of the Fourth Section, apart from the quoted sections in the final chapter, the rest is only briefly described. For brevity, many important arguments in the original book have been omitted. For detailed information, please refer to the full text of the report. The original text of the Second Volume Report can be purchased directly from Kelly &amp; Walsh, China American Publishing Company, and Evans &amp; Sons Limited, priced at two dollars and fifty cents each. The Chinese translation is in progress.</p>
<p>The report is divided into seven sections as follows: Section 1, Introduction; Section 2, History and Status of the Public Concession and Its Governance System; Section 3, Shanghai Business Interests; Section 4, Statements Received Regarding Political and Administrative Issues and Their Comments; Section 5, Key Issues Concerning the Future of the Public Concession; Section 6, Outside Road Surface; Section 7, Addendum. The first three sections of the report have already been published. What is now being published is the report of the Fourth and Fifth Sections.</p>
<p>The letter from Mr. Fei Tang to the Chairman of the Municipal Council on June 15th has been summarized and published at the beginning of the Second Volume Report as a preface, as follows: "I firmly believe that readers of this report will remember the full responsibility for the content of the report, as mentioned in my letter to your Chairman on April 23rd, which served as the preface to the first volume of the report, rests solely with me and is unrelated to any other individuals, as well as my desired attitude of readers of this report. One thing I have paid attention to is the comment published in a certain Chinese weekly newspaper on May 14th regarding the first volume of the report, which stated, 'The entire report is divided into two volumes and has not yet been sold, but it has long been archived and has been submitted to the British government for approval before publication.' This rumor is completely inaccurate. When the first volume of the report was published on April 25th, the currently published second volume was still being compiled and was far from completion. No part of this report has ever been submitted to the British government or any other government for approval at any time. The report stated that on April 27th, British Foreign Secretary Mr. Henderson mentioned in the House of Commons in response to a question that 'this report has been seen.' It is speculated that this answer refers to the chapters in the first volume, as I had sent the proofs of each chapter to London in advance so that the London press could also receive them on the day of publication here. These proofs were indeed delivered to London on April 20th, five days before publication here. Mr. Henderson's answer on April 27th, stating that 'the report has been seen,' must refer to these chapters. Mr. Henderson could not have seen other chapters, nor were there other chapters available for Mr. Henderson to read. If this answer is taken seriously and becomes the basis of the aforementioned rumor, it is a complete misunderstanding. The reason I mention this rumor is because someone told me that if it is not corrected, it may cause misunderstandings and harmful consequences in certain aspects. Readers of this volume may not have seen the first volume, so I believe that the letter from me to the Chairman of the Municipal Council on April 23, 1931, which was published in the first volume of the report as a preface, should be summarized and reprinted as follows: 'The Municipal Council, especially me, has conducted a free investigation entirely in accordance with the law, and at the same time, has gladly provided assistance to my request, for which I am deeply grateful. The assistance of the Council members and staff is extremely valuable. I have found the assistance of these people to be the same as the assistance of the majority of people outside the Council who have nothing to do with Council affairs. The topics I should pay attention to and the sources I should ask are entirely up to me to decide freely. After the materials are collected, I am free to process and judge them in accordance with the law. The full responsibility for the content of the report, therefore, rests solely with me. Only I am bound by the chapters in this volume and the volumes that will continue to be published, and no one else. Regarding the attitude of readers of my report, I would like to briefly state my wishes as follows: Those who are familiar with the situation in Shanghai, regarding the problems that I have been entrusted to deal with, will recognize its difficulty and complexity. My requests for assistance have been readily granted, mostly due to deep sympathy for the difficulty of my duties. Regarding the facts of this difficulty, it may allow me to make a request to the reader, whether they are in Shanghai or not. I would like to ask all readers to listen patiently so that I can finish my words, and when reading the report, not only be patient but also have an open mind. When preparing the report, I deeply felt that the greatest service I could hope to provide to all citizens of the Public Concession, to the best of my ability, was to make a fair and unbiased account of the main facts regarding the situation in the Concession. This account must include all issues that have been fiercely disputed in the past or present, and when conducting a fair study of these issues in their true light, there may be remarks that are not welcomed by one party or another. Part of what is said may not be accepted by a portion of foreigners' opinions, and another part of what is said may not be accepted by a portion of Chinese opinions. I sincerely ask all parties concerned not to be resentful of what I say. If I were to offend the intentions of this party or that party, and not present the various relevant reasons that must be taken into account, then I would fail to fulfill the duties that the Municipal Council, representing all residents of the Concession, has unanimously asked me to undertake. My responsibility is very clear, that is, not only to avoid discussing the problems seen in order to make the report acceptable to the general public, but also to avoid mentioning the main reasons why this party or that party's point of view is considered unpleasant. The length of the report is inevitable, as mentioned above. I would like to specifically ask readers not to read each section separately from its context, or only hold on to a certain word or sentence, or not seek the complete meaning of the offense, and make judgments. Please read the entire report completely first."</p>
<p>Section 4: This section describes the statements received regarding political and administrative issues and their comments. Chapter 1 describes the detailed organization of the taxpaying Chinese. In early March 1930, the association submitted a set of questions to solicit opinions on various issues related to the administration of the Public Concession and suggestions regarding the future of the Concession. The set of questions is quoted, and a portion of the answers received by the association is reprinted. The most detailed of the answers received is the statement of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, which was published by the Federation itself in the newspaper. Five other simpler answers from various guilds are also quoted. Comments on the arguments raised in each answer have mostly been made in later chapters. What is noted here is that although all answers advocate the recovery of the Public Concession, and some advocate immediate recovery, there are two cases that advocate that a transitional period should be undergone before recovery. The relevant groups in each answer all hope to make certain modifications to the current organizational law so that the Chinese can participate more in the management of the affairs of the Public Concession, and hope that this modification can be realized before recovery. Chapter 2 describes the written statements of opinions from religious groups residing in or near the Public Concession. Certain general questions regarding the current administration of the Public Concession and its possible future plans have been submitted to each religious group for consideration. Chapter 3 describes the statement submitted by the Joint Committee of Women's Associations regarding the suppression of industrial conditions. The general comments on this statement are as follows: This statement notes a major defect in the current organizational law of the Public Concession, namely the lack of sufficient legislative power. This defect has been mentioned before and will be discussed in detail in Chapter 5. The topic specifically addressed by the Joint Committee of Women's Associations is the suppression and improvement of industrial conditions in and around the Public Concession. This topic has a great impact on the welfare of the Chinese society in the Public Concession and involves far-reaching economic issues, making it one of the most important issues for which legislative and administrative powers must be expanded. The report then describes the Child Labor Committee from 1923 to 1924. The report of the committee describes the situation of child labor in factories in and around the Public Concession, as well as the factory law promulgated by the National Government but not yet implemented. Examples are also given to indicate the drastic nature of all the provisions of the law and comments are made as follows: If the newly formulated law is immediately and fully enforced, the result will inevitably be industrial chaos, factory closures, and countless workers will lose their jobs. The source of capital for Chinese factories is often smaller than that of foreign factories, so the impact on Chinese factories will be far greater than on foreign factories. However, it is extremely important to start improving the current factory conditions, especially the improvement of child labor factory conditions. The report of the Child Labor Committee has vividly described this situation. Chapter 4 describes the resolutions on public health issues passed by the Shanghai Medical Association in March 1930 and discusses various issues regarding the public health administration of the Public Concession. What is emphasized is the opposition faced by those who promote public health in Shanghai, which is of a particularly serious nature. The reason is that the Chinese attitude is conservative, distrustful of modern medicine, and their habits and lifestyles are old-fashioned. When interfered with by civil servants responsible for implementing public health prevention methods, they strongly oppose it. The fierce situation formed in November 1910 due to the attempt to implement plague prevention is quoted in the report, and it is pointed out that although the hospitals and medical facilities provided to meet the needs of the Chinese people cannot be compared with those provided for foreigners, "as far as the general work of the Municipal Council's Health Department is concerned, not only do the Chinese obtain the majority of the benefits of the affairs handled by the department on an equal footing with foreigners, but all the work of the department has been and still is carried out for the special interests of the Chinese people, which is not a small number." Moreover, "the work done for the Chinese people is mostly done in the face of special difficulties, and even though these difficulties are encountered, valuable work has been accomplished." The health investigation team of the League of Nations came to China at the end of 1929 to conduct an investigation and prepared a statement including comments on the general situation of public health in Shanghai, and mentioning the work of the Municipal Council's Health Department of the Public Concession and the Shanghai Municipal Government's Health Bureau. The summary of this statement is also quoted in the report. The report then mentions the Hospital and Nursing Services Committee organized by the Municipal Council of the Public Concession in July 1931, but the committee has not yet submitted its report. The part of the statement submitted by the Federation of Trade Unions regarding the hospital issue is quoted as follows: The sanitary equipment in the concession is extremely incomplete for the Chinese people. For example, in the case of hospitals, although the Chinese population is over 800,000, the number of hospitals is very few, while Westerners have many conveniences. The comments on this statement are as follows: Although this statement contains some important facts, its understanding of the general situation of the Public Concession in terms of hospital facilities and medical convenience is superficial and misleading. The Municipal Council has undoubtedly provided more hospital and medical equipment for the Chinese people in and around the Concession than any Chinese municipal authority has provided for the Chinese people in its jurisdiction. The details mentioned above indicate that the Municipal Council has specially established an isolation hospital for the Chinese people, and has given annual subsidies to several other hospitals, either exclusively serving the Chinese people or allowing Chinese people who seek medical treatment to receive it together with foreigners. In addition, it must be remembered that most of the hospitals in the Public Concession that are set up for foreigners are operated by private foreigners or generously donated by foreigners. The main hospital in the Public Concession that is set up for the Chinese people was founded by foreign philanthropists, and its maintenance costs are mostly dependent on foreign donations. However, in terms of municipal expenditure, the equipment supplied to meet the needs of foreigners is indeed more complete than the equipment supplied to meet the needs of the Chinese people. The total amount of public funds in the Public Concession used to provide medical care for a small number of foreigners is indeed greater than that used to meet the needs of Chinese hospitals. This is also the actual situation. However, it must be noted that because the salaries of foreign nurses are better, the maintenance cost of hospital equipment, calculated per bed, is greater for foreign patients than for Chinese patients. The difficulties experienced by the Chinese in accepting hospital treatment and complying with its rules have been described above. Although the prejudices of the Chinese against hospital treatment are now gradually being broken down, these difficulties still exist. The equipment for supplying the medical needs of poor Chinese people seems to need to be increased. No matter what method is used, allocating municipal funds to expand this equipment will help to eliminate the current inequality in the medical convenience of hospitals and medicine provided by the Municipal Council for Chinese and foreign residents.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Greetings. Yesterday, I read a letter in your newspaper's "Letters to the Editor" column from Lu Muqin et al., refuting a letter from several factories. The letter referred to Mr. Gu Yongquan, the manager of our factory, as a "labor traitor" who sells out the workers. This kind of argument is not worth refuting. Fearing that people from all walks of life do not understand the truth, I have written a few words as follows. I hope that your newspaper will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column. This is my sincere hope. Lu Muqin, as the secretary of the Silk Mercerizing Industry Union, is naturally biased towards the workers' side. All the unions' full-scale attack on Mr. Gu is also the same. Therefore, in addition to publishing a rebuttal in the newspaper, Mr. Gu will laugh off any similar comments in the future and will not engage in such meaningless debates. I hope that people from all walks of life will investigate and clarify the situation, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper's local news that "the National Goods Department Store replied to the Municipal Council yesterday..." and "the National Goods Department Store was sealed." I was very surprised. The department store that was mistakenly sealed by the Municipal Council this time is the China United National Products Department Store (located in the New World), while the National Goods Department Store is organized by our office (located north of Tianhougong Bridge). The names are different, and the addresses are completely different. I am deeply afraid of misunderstandings in all circles, which will affect the future of our store's business. I hereby write to you to request that you urgently correct it. Sincerely, to the editor of the local news of Shen Bao.</p>

<p>King Manuel II of Portugal. Manoel, since abdicating and leaving the country, has lived in England and France. He is an expert in horticulture and has written an important book discussing Portuguese literature.</p>
<p>Beggars in Birmingham, England, run their own newspaper called "The Abraham Man's News."</p>
<p>"The Abraham Man's News" is printed on a single sheet of mimeograph paper and costs one and a half pence. All the text is in the vernacular of the market.</p>
<p>The only countries in Europe that manufacture hand-cranked organs are Scotland and Belgium. In 1929, a centenary celebration was held. This was a very interesting commemorative ceremony.</p>

<p>Greenland, in the Arctic region, is a very cold and desolate place in the far north. Recently, the United States used a wheelbarrow to transport wood there to build an auditorium, a parsonage, and a store. The wood has been pre-fabricated and only needs to be assembled to become houses.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Trade of Humans <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Using people as commodities for buying and selling. Those who engage in this profession, their cruelty is self-evident. In the past, there was the trade of black slaves in the Americas. Those who engaged in this business made considerable profits. It was not until Lincoln freed the black slaves and the Civil War was resolved that the sale of black slaves was no longer heard of. And with all the republics, we thought that black slaves would no longer be sold as human beings. Unexpectedly, in Africa, the slave system has been revived in recent years, and the trade of black slaves is thriving again.</p>
<p>But looking back at China, although there is no organization for trafficking in people, the business of selling people is quite developed, just like in Africa. There are also many people engaged in this business. Most of them are local ruffians and hooligans who have no means of making a living, so they engage in abducting and selling young boys and girls. It is said that young girls from the Suzhou area are most welcomed by overseas Chinese in Singapore. Generally, kidnappers abduct young girls and transport them to Singapore for sale. The profits are rare. It is said that in Singapore, there is a secret market for auctioning off young girls, and the business is quite developed. Therefore, there is an oversupply of young girls transported there.</p>
<p>Singapore is a necessary transit point for East-West traffic. The city is quite developed, and the society is quite complex. Therefore, there are more dark sides than anywhere else. Westerners often call it the "dark market" for this reason. In addition to the auction of young girls, there are also secret companies set up to sell children. Those who engage in this business have very flexible social skills and interact with wealthy people in the area. Therefore, all children can be sold. As for the source of the children, most of them are also abducted by kidnappers. In addition, poor people who are unable to support their children also entrust them to the company for sale.</p>
<p>In my hometown, those who engage in this trafficking of people are called "white ants" or "human head traffickers." Most of them are unemployed vagrants. Young girls with unstable wills are sometimes lured and sold by these people. In other cases, widows take the initiative to ask traffickers for help, or they are forced to marry by their in-laws, and traffickers act as underwriters to profit from it. These are particularly common. However, those who are sold are mostly young girls, so that they can be taken as wives or concubines. This kind of tragedy occurs from time to time and is also the misfortune of mankind.</p>

<p>— Chen Xiaocui</p>
<p>At night in the mountains, the smoke rises heavily, the crescent moon hangs like a carved bow at dawn. The cold clouds vast, transform into a sea, several peaks faintly immersed, like blue lotus. In this place where human footprints never reach, the dark color stretches far, connecting with the prehistoric wilderness. Looking down at the heavenly gate, a strip of striped carnelian. Suddenly, a single hair splits open the primordial chaos. Fu Xi tries his brush, Nüwa dies, there is a gap in the emotional sky that no one can sew. A beauty like a flower, separated by clouds, the tassel half-rolled, the lamp dimly red. Yi's bow flies and shoots arrows, the sound trails. The Xuanyuan mirror emerges from its box, the light is harmonious. Scales and armor of pure gold, painting the autumn waters, rolling up into the sky, all are fish and dragons. Looking down, the mortal world is still quiet, thousands and thousands of miles, no human traces. The red city glows with a carmine color, the trees all over the mountains are red maples. The floating clouds drift away with the distant wind. I will leave to find Chisongzi.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Record of Strange Events Regarding an Ancient Ginkgo Tree <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Li Biya</p>
<p>Kunshan and Jiading border each other. There is a stone beam called Datong Bridge. The area is named Datong Bridge. There is an ancient Jixian Temple next to the bridge. Most of it has been destroyed. The clay bodhisattvas are not sheltered from the wind and rain. The villagers want to rebuild it to preserve the ancient site. They are suffering from a lack of funds. That's all. Unexpectedly, there is now unexpected wealth flowing in, and the goal of rebuilding the ancient Jixian Temple will soon be achieved. It sounds very strange and inevitably involves superstition. However, this is what I witnessed and did not get from hearsay. I can tell the readers of Free Talk about it. In front of the mountain gate of the ancient Jixian Temple, there are two ancient ginkgo trees, lined up east and west. They are five or six spans in size. The elders say that they are ancient trees that are thousands of years old. Last month, one of the western trees suddenly caught fire. The tree was hollow. The fire flew out from the hollow. There was a defense team nearby. They bravely came to rescue. It took five or six hours to extinguish it. Where the fire flew out, a large branch broke off. It was several feet long and the size of a hug. As for the cause of the fire, opinions differ. Some say that a monk threw the remaining incense into the hollow of the tree roots. Some say that a passerby rested, leaning against the tree roots, and the remaining incense smoke was left in the root hole. Decayed leaves accumulated in the hole, causing it to ignite. The latter saying is accidental and not surprising. The former saying seems to have an effect. Of those who believe the former saying now, more than ninety out of a hundred. Several days after the ancient ginkgo tree was destroyed by the fire, someone suddenly came from Zhenru, Nanchang to peel the bark of the ancient ginkgo tree that had been destroyed. It is said that someone said that this is a miraculous elixir that can cure all diseases. The next day, more people came. The local people, to prevent the ancient trees from not being burned to death by the fire, died from peeling the bark. So they surrounded it with bamboo fences, and because they begged to take the elixir, they broke off a large branch, analyzed it, and gave it to the comers. After a day or two, more and more people came. The local people said that they could take this opportunity to build the ancient Jixian Temple to preserve the ancient site. So the yellow book was established, and the donors were numerous. There is a general situation of the minister's door being like a market. It is said that since the establishment of the yellow book, three copies have been changed. The current payment has accumulated about two or three hundred silver dollars. There are also this number of people who have donated but have not yet paid. There are also wealthy people who are willing to donate hundreds of tube tiles and tens of thousands of wall bricks, enthusiastically transporting them. They all said that even if they take one or two leaves of the ancient ginkgo tree and decoct them, the disease will be cured immediately. Therefore, the payment of wishes is rapid. At first, I did not believe it. I went to watch with a friend and exclaimed in amazement. My friend said to me, "The ancient ginkgo tree has the heart to save the world and is willing to sacrifice itself to avoid the suffering of the sick. It is touching." I responded, "Our people have suffered a lot. Who wouldn't be willing to burn incense and bow down to those who can sacrifice themselves to save them? It is a pity that those who have the heart to save the world do not have the great power of the ancient ginkgo tree. Those who have the great power similar to the ancient ginkgo tree have no heart to save the world. Where can our people go to beg for elixir?"</p>
<h3 id="e100">Miscellaneous Talks on Loquats <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>"The loquat is slightly yellow, still bearing a hint of sourness." This is a line from Su Changgong's poem. Loquat is another name for loquat. The "Group of Fragrances" says that loquats sprout in autumn, flower in winter, bear fruit in spring, and ripen in summer, possessing the energy of all four seasons. No other fruit can compare. It is indeed a precious fruit. In this sweltering weather, with fragrant loquats in a green basket, I casually write this essay, and I cannot help but feel my saliva dripping.</p>
<p>It is said that Scholar Zhu Zha of Xiushui was close friends with a certain Taoist priest. There were two loquat trees in the Taoist temple. During hot weather, he often saw the loquats being harvested. None of them had seeds. Zhu Zha asked the reason. The Taoist priest replied that they were immortal seeds. Zhu Zha did not believe it. He knew that the Taoist priest loved steamed pork. One day, he invited him over and ordered a servant to buy a pig's shoulder. He purposely showed it to the Taoist priest, and before long, it was served as a dish. It was thoroughly cooked, fatty, and delicious. The Taoist priest ate his fill. Then he asked Zhu Zha about the method of quick transformation. Zhu Zha said, "I happen to have a small trick, which I would like to exchange for the loquat seed." The Taoist priest whispered, "It's nothing. Just pluck out the central stamen when it first blooms." Zhu Zha said, "Then my dish is nothing special either. It was what I had prepared beforehand." They both clapped their hands and laughed. Loquats without seeds are called "Jiaozi" and are found in Guangzhou, according to the "Guang Zhi."</p>
<p>Once, in Li Xiushan's secretariat, there was a secretary who had a concubine named "Red Loquat." The concubine was good at playing the pipa and loved to eat loquats, hence the name. Gan Zhi wrote the "Elegy of the Pipa's Shadow" for Red Loquat, depicting her life story with utmost sorrow and captivating beauty. It was widely recited at the time.</p>
<p>Loquat leaves are as big as donkey ears. Cantonese people call them "Worry-Free Fans." Boiling them for drinking can cure coughs. However, there is a fuzzy yellow down on the back, which should be brushed off. Otherwise, it will not only be useless but also harmful. Therefore, sick people often buy ready-made loquat leaf dew to replace it.</p>
<p>My Suzhou Dongting Mountain is famous for producing loquats. There are red sand and white sand varieties. White sand is better. There is also a small, flat variety called "Water Chestnut Seed," which is even more superior.</p>
<p>"The wind and dew fill the sky, the loquats are ripe, I bring them home to offer to my loving mother, to taste as she pleases." This is a line from Chen Ji's poem. Reading it, one cannot help but feel filial piety arise spontaneously. There are also Bai Juyi's poem, "On the side of Huai Mountain, the shadow of the Chu River, in May, the loquats fill the forest," and Lu You's poem, "The branches are not afraid of the wind shaking them down, the tree only worries about the birds pecking them away," all of which add to the luster of loquats.</p>
<p>Loquat. Seeds sprout directly. Wait for them to grow before transplanting. In the third month of spring, graft them with other woody plants. Cover them with ashes. The branches and leaves dance, and they do not wither in the frost, hence the name "Late Verdant Loquat."</p>
<p>Loquat jelly is a refined food. The method is to peel and pit the loquats, cut them into thin slices, add an appropriate amount of water, and simmer them over a low fire until they are soft and mushy. Strain the juice, mix it with powdered sugar, place it in a candied fruit jar, simmer for a few minutes to melt the sugar, then heat it to a boil. Pour it into a glass basin, seal it, and immerse it in cold water for about half an hour. It will become a clear jelly.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Cultural Movements That the Capital Should Undertake in the Future (Part 1) <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>The term "exhibition" has only been around for fifteen years in our country. Before that, there was only the term "Sai Zeng" (a type of folk performance). It first evolved from the masses. People like us who study art often hold exhibitions. In the last ten years, there have been international, group, and private art movements of various kinds. At least it has awakened the public to the concept of "exhibition." In the spring of the 18th year (of the Republic), Shanghai held a National Art Exhibition, sponsored by the Ministry of Education. And the First Art Exhibition recently opened in the capital is even more worthy of our attention. Because the venue is in the capital. (Exhibitions held by the state are held in the capital). I have two points about the significance of the capital hosting art exhibitions to promote cultural undertakings that I want to state first. All public exhibitions related to cultural movements, especially those sponsored by national educational institutions, must have a permanent organization. It is definitely not enough to hold one occasionally and then let it pass. It must be held every year within a prescribed time. If you just think about holding it, and stop if there is no funding or you are afraid of trouble, the effect is minimal. There must be a first session, a second session, and so on indefinitely. From the simplicity of the first session to gradual perfection. From the crudeness of the works in the first session to gradual refinement. This all needs to be corrected through careful management. This is my first hope.</p>
<p>All exhibitions held by national educational institutions must have rewards after review. The improvement of public art and the efforts of various artists all depend on the government agencies having corresponding rewards. After the award methods are established, the quality of the exhibits will increase year by year. On the one hand, it will make various artists bury themselves in their work, and on the other hand, it will produce the essence of national art. This is my second hope.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two hopes, what is even more needed after the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, thinking from this exhibition, is the movement to prepare for the Capital Art Museum. And I hope that everyone will support the art museum movement, to add glory to the Chinese nation, to promote and carry forward our country's culture for thousands of years, to be a cultural leader in the capital after the success of the revolution, and for the appearance of the emerging capital, there must be an art museum organization. In various European countries I have traveled to, not to mention that cities have art museums and museum facilities, even a small town has a small-scale embellishment. Last winter, when I returned to China from Europe, I felt the necessity of organizing an art museum. I discussed it with Mr. Li Shizeng and Cai Zimin in Shanghai, and Mr. Li agreed. First, an art exhibition hall was established in Shanghai. It is currently under construction and will be completed in two months. But I think it is even more necessary to establish an art museum in Nanjing than in Shanghai. Because the capital is the center of the country, where people look, and especially the cultural symbol of a country must be tasted in art. Now there are foreigners stepping on my land and coming to my capital. If they ask where the art museum is, we have nothing to answer. It is truly regrettable. Therefore, we must have a movement to organize an art museum.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders as he said this. The crow's feet at the corners of his eyes all moved, showing his pride. He continued, "Tell me, first, second, and third-class prostitutes, which one can't you go to? If you go and pick a girl, that's the group, right? Drinking fragrant tea and smoking cigarettes to your heart's content. They wouldn't dare take your money. Those little girls in the top-class groups, you've seen them on the road. Would they even give you a proper look? But once you become a soldier, they have to serve you. The benefits of being a soldier are endless. Don't be afraid of fighting. If there's no war, where do soldiers go to make a name for themselves? Haven't you heard? Liu Bei sold straw sandals, Zhang Fei sold meat, and Lord Guan even drove a cart. Didn't they all end up as brothers as ruler and subjects because of fighting? Xue Rengui was named Prince of Pingliao. Anyone who's seen the play knows he went to join the army as a beggar, right? A hero isn't afraid of a humble beginning. It all depends on what you do. Our division commander started as a common soldier. Now look at his power! Mansions, cars, concubines! Is there anything he doesn't have? Where else can you go to win merit if not in war? A real man shouldn't be afraid of death. From the day a person is born, the King of Hell has already determined their lifespan. If it's not time to die, you won't die. If it is, you can't escape. As the saying goes, 'What is destined cannot be avoided. The country is always conquered by fighting.' Waiting for free food to fall into your mouth? That's never going to happen. If you want to make a name for yourselves, come join the army with me. You can't go wrong. If you're doing petty business, you'll do petty business your whole life. If you're pulling rickshaws, you'll pull rickshaws your whole life. In this colorful world, if you don't get your share of anything, you've come for nothing. I've finished talking. Are there any volunteers?" As soon as he said this, two people walked out of the crowd and said, "Commander, I'll go!" The soldier smiled and said, "Good for you for being so sensible. Who else?" As he spoke, he swept his gaze over the crowd like a machine gun, landing on Zhang Xiaosan. Zhang Xiaosan said, "Okay, I'll go too." As he spoke, he walked in front of the soldier, rubbing his hands together and looking around, as if he didn't know what to do. The soldier said, "You sit with them first. We'll leave together in a while." So Zhang Xiaosan joined the group of people listening to the speech. The soldier continued his speech with a smile. No one else knew how happy he was in his heart. Because if everyone was so eager to join the army, he could easily recruit a platoon in half a day. According to the rules of his camp, he could at least become a platoon leader.</p>

<p>Grain: The Hexia Rice Market is Stable</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, the rice market was inactive. In the early morning, the number of people visiting the market from various shops was quite large, but the buyers' attitude was slack, so the selling price was difficult to stabilize, and there was a tendency to fall back. The amount of foreign rice arriving was not much, and the demand was still strong. The situation tended to be stable. Changshu and Beigeng rice, as well as early and late rice, were lower than the previous market price, which was actually due to the large amount of inventory and the low expectations of the people. Duyang tip rice sales were not good, and the transactions in rural villages were sluggish, making it difficult for the overall market to improve. Fermented glutinous rice wine was bought in large quantities, and the opening price was reduced by five cents.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai: Yesterday morning, it was rainy, and the sources from various gangs were few. Due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival and the disaster relief funds, the people's sentiments were calm, and the market trend was relatively slack, with reduced transactions. The medium-term goods became increasingly sluggish, resulting in an increase in the price of thick japonica rice. There was no appetite for thin indica rice either. There were some transactions in Ningbo rice, with no price increase or decrease. Duyang tip rice was scarce and did not rise or fall. The demand for glutinous rice that has deteriorated in quality was low, showing a downward trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market situation for Ke Xian rice: the Fuzhou gang stopped and remained inactive, and the market turned from active to sluggish. However, the price of rice in Hexia was slightly better. This street paid attention to Ke Xian rice again, purchasing 540 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at prices ranging from 11.1 to 11.3 yuan. The market was better than the previous market. If this street continues to purchase Ke Xian rice today and tomorrow, the future market will still have to improve. Both parties abandoned and held onto foreign rice, and there were no transactions. However, the Sichuan gang had a disaster relief route, and nearly 10,000 bags of Saigon rice, etc., were directly allocated and transited by brokers.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: European and American Factories' Telegrams Show Poor Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in foreign firms in this port continued to be firm. It was recorded that the sales of Huangbai factory silk to the United States had not improved, and it was difficult to improve sales via telegram from Lyon. Yesterday, Shen Yu and others entered 30 bales of Shanghai White Factory silk, and Xin Shichang and others entered 40 bales of Yellow Factory silk, all at firm prices.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Red and Green Tea Both Trend Downward <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in foreign firms in this port, green tea from various routes such as Luzhuang and Tuzhuang, and Qimen black tea, saw more frequent transactions as Chinese tea merchants loosened their asking prices compared to before. The market price of Zhenmei tea with the core removed from Yuantunxi opened at 260-270 taels, 40-50 taels lower than before. Only Tongfu Foreign Firm slightly purchased ordinary Chunzhuang Zhenmei tea. However, brokers were eager to buy needle tea and pearl tea, and the selling price was also firm. The market prices of the remaining Gongxi green tea and Qimen Hekou black tea all fell by more than ten to twenty taels.</p>
<p>Dried Goods: The Inventory of Longan is Not Large</p>
<p>Prices Remain Firm During the Mold Season</p>
<p>Recently, the arrival of dried longan has been scarce. The market inventory is not large. During the mold season, according to the situation in previous years, the price would definitely drop. However, this year, the poor harvest in various places has become a reality, so the current transaction is not prosperous, but the market price is firm. Merchants are also preparing to bake the goods to prevent spoilage. According to insiders, it is expected that high-end goods may reach 40 taels in the future, so most people are waiting and unwilling to sell. Judging from the situation in various parties, this statement is likely to be realized.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Rise by One Penny</p>
<p>Crystal Flower Green Sugar is Rising and Popular</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market news: the spot price of Cuban sugar has not changed, the September futures price of New York sugar fell by two points compared to the previous time, and the futures prices of other months also fell by one point each. The spot and futures prices of Javanese sugar still lack upward or downward movement. The association's market plan, Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar market atmosphere is very strong, and the number of sellers is very few, so the asking price is higher, but the demand from crystal sugar factories is very strong, and the price is gradually rising by one penny, with a transaction price of 11.7 taels, and more than a thousand bags were traded. However, the merchant's price is auspicious, and the price is the same for special sales, so the future trend is very uncertain. No. 20 market medium sand white sugar is 11 taels, and the transaction is also quiet. The Japanese sugar market is firm, but the sales are not smooth, and the customs is relatively quiet. N Mark is 11 taels, 3 mace, 2 fen and 5 li, new goods are 11 taels, 3 mace and 7 fen and 5 li, YT Mark is 11 taels, 3 mace and 2 fen and 5 li, TK Mark is 11 taels and 4 mace, AR Mark is 11 taels and 5 mace, YP Mark is 11 taels and 7 mace and 5 li, Minghua goods are 11 taels and 7 mace, YRO Mark is 11 taels, and SH Mark is 11 taels and 1 mace. The market situation is flat and not surprising. The merchant's price of Crystal Flower Green original goods opened with more than 200 bags, and the price rose to 10 taels and 4 mace. The domestic Huanggang Green opened with more than 800 packages, with prices ranging from 8 taels 2 mace to 3 mace, and the higher ones at 8 taels 3 mace and 5 fen. Because the market inventory is very scarce and the producing area is rising sharply, the market situation is extremely firm and popular.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Melton Cloth Sales are Strong and Popular</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were already people in the market asking for samples and prices of Melton cloth. There were also many transactions between counterparts in the Tongyi Association. This street wrote in about dozens of boxes. Ningfeng's No. 1 sold for 2 taels and 4 mace and 5 fen, No. 2 for 2 taels and 5 fen, Deji's Shangtiantai for 2 taels and 8 mace and 2 fen and 5 li, Shunquanlong's Jinghualu for 1 tael and 9 mace, and Huabo for 2 taels and 1 mace. There were very few 2-tael import Melton cloth, and the market situation was quite strong and popular.</p>
<h3 id="e111">White Bombazine and Straight Tribute Satin are Popular and Rising <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>White bombazine and white straight tribute satin have been selling well in the market recently, and the demand from buyers is very strong. The stock is completely exhausted. Yesterday, Heji's Haoshi white straight tribute satin and Yiji's No. 1 and No. 2 white bombazine were difficult to find even at high prices. As a result, Donghuo Sanjing white bombazine and white straight tribute satin, as well as Hong Kong goods, etc., were in great demand. Sanjing white bombazine was uniformly sold at 4 taels net price, white straight tribute satin at 4 taels and 6 mace and 5 fen, Yiji's 1111 Daoxiancao at 4 taels and 9 mace, Weishi's white straight tribute at 5 taels, and Heji's at 5 taels and 9 mace. Most of them had no goods to deliver, which was a matter of speculative trading.</p>

<p>Will Publish as a Separate Volume</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Jianchen's newly written three-act play, "The Hurricane," has reportedly already been rehearsed at the Wuxi Educational Institute. We read Mr. Tianniu's article, "Presenting 'The Hurricane' to the Modern Theatrical World," in the Shenbao on the 19th of this month, and learned that the play depicts the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese nations with Manchuria and Mongolia as the backdrop, using a Korean woman as the main thread of the entire play. In the play, the young man Yang Zhiqin gathers comrades to implement a plan to develop Manchuria and Mongolia, but it is sabotaged by the Japanese. The map and plan are lost, and Yang Zhiqin suffers an unjust accusation. He is not only spurned by the people, but his fiancée also cancels their engagement. Rumors outside accuse him of being lured by the Japanese and he is labeled a traitor. Unable to clear his name, he becomes ill. Fortunately, Ono Umeko, who believes herself to be Japanese, realizes that she is actually a Korean woman and confesses in front of the Chinese, returning the stolen map and plan. However, the poor young man Yang Zhiqin has already gone mad and committed suicide. Later, the Korean woman is also killed by the Japanese. When we see such a plot, how moving it is! We hope that this script will be published soon so that we can read it first. Moreover, at a time when the school play movement is booming and there is a shortage of scripts, this kind of script is worth adopting for performance. It is now said that Mr. Gu has sent the original manuscript to the Vanguard Weekly, and the magazine will publish it in issues 45, 46, 47, and 48, and will combine these issues of the Weekly into a separate volume, completely publishing Mr. Gu's script, equivalent to a separate edition of "The Hurricane," which will be published soon. The general distributor is Daguang Bookstore, Ximenfang Xielu.</p>
<h3 id="e121">After Viewing Mr. Suzuki's Oil Painting Exhibition <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Baoyi</p>
<p>The "Oil Painting Exhibition of Mr. Ryozo Suzuki," held at the Japanese Club a few days ago (May 29th and 30th), was one of the most outstanding Japanese Western-style painting exhibitions recently held.</p>
<p>I had heard Mr. Ryozo Suzuki's name before, but this was the first time I saw his work.</p>
<p>There were over fifty works on display, mostly landscapes, the fruits of his sketching trip to China this time. There were also several portraits.</p>
<p>There are many excellent works among the exhibits... His style is a realism that does not fall into the trap of sweetness... Although it exudes a delicate and harmonious coordination, it has a robust and clear expression... The picture plane is handled with composure, and one type is shrouded in a silver-gray harmony... Another type has light and delicate mass (volume of color), interspersed with gentle, delicate line drawing... These are lines cleverly used according to what he is trying to express.</p>
<p>As for the works, in addition to what seem to be the artist's prized pieces... "The Shade of the Willow," "Girl," "Autumn Moon on the Calm Lake" (No. 1), "Small Scene on the Lake Shore," etc., there are many other excellent works. To briefly mention a few, for example:</p>
<p>"West Lake Pleasure Boat" (Sketch, about 3 hao in size), depicting a portion of the lake surface... The lake surface is a somber lead color, with a yacht with a white awning floating among the gentle ripples, a quiet and lovely small piece.</p>
<p>"Spring Rain on West Lake" (25 hao in size) is a painting depicted with a high degree of detail. On the left side of the foreground is part of a white wall. The old trees and shrubs in front and below the mountain are depicted in gentle and quiet bright and dark greens. The lake water, sky, and the entire harmony drift in a hazy light silver-gray.</p>
<p>"Afternoon Glare" is a painting depicting a clear and dark green water surface, and buildings and trees in the foreground depicted in somber warm colors, beautifully harmonized... In colors that are not particularly bright, it gives one a refreshing sense of the warm sunshine of the afternoon bathing the entire scene.</p>
<p>"Autumn Moon on the Calm Lake" (No. 2) (painting about 30 hao in size)... This uses architecture as its theme, depicted in somber colors, and is very capable of expressing the beauty and interest of our country's ancient architecture. In terms of its depiction, it is also seen to be expressed extremely appropriately, and although realistic, it does not fall into triviality.</p>
<p>The large "House by the Pond" primarily depicts a section of a house, a long corridor, and trees (two women in red and blue clothing stand in the shade of the corridor). Shade and light intersect gently across the entire picture, and the colors, though bright, have a certain solidity, beautifully expressing the sentiment of early summer.</p>
<p>"Early Summer on Tianping Mountain" (large)... The trees and mountain scenery are harmonized in color. In particular, the distant high mountains, with their craggy rocks, are expressed lightly in a pale purple tinged with ocher and pale green.</p>
<p>"Early Summer Path" is also a painting that is very capable of expressing the sentiments of an early summer garden. The brushwork is brisk and clear, and the colors of the trees, walls, and stone paths in the distance and near make a beautiful harmony.</p>
<p>"Liuyuan Garden" depicts a somber, brownish-green pond, with an old tree stretching obliquely over the water surface, and the white reflection of the buildings opposite... The overall tone is somber and elegant, filled with the charm of an ancient garden.</p>
<p>"New Greenery at the Humble Administrator's Garden" (large)... takes the architecture in the garden as its theme... The beauty of the architecture is wonderfully embellished amidst the contrasting light and shade of the vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>"Beside Fangyuan Garden"... depicts a cow in front of a white wall and two old trees with light brushstrokes. The colors are light, simple, and contain a poetic feeling in an ancient style.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also "Kaiyuan Temple Road" with its pale blue sky, yellow walls, and dark road... "House by the Water," which is mainly black... "Releasing Fish Garden," with its somber brownish-green water surface and buildings and pavilions in the distance and near, etc., are all deeply evocative.</p>
<p>As for the depiction of figures, I consider the half-length portrait of a woman wearing black clothes against a silver-gray background... the half-length portrait of a man wearing gray clothes against a black background, "Portrait of Mr. I"... and the village girl "Country Girl," painted in black tones against a light ocher background, to be the best.</p>
<p>Originally, Mr. Suzuki was a craftsman. In 1922, he graduated from Jikei University School of Medicine. He helped his father in his business with his brother and ran the Mito Shimoichi Hospital. However, on the one hand, he loved painting deeply since childhood and was taught by the late talented painter Mr. Nakamura... Since the spring of 1923, when his work was exhibited at the "Art Exhibition of the Peace Exposition," his name has been known in the art world. His passion for art finally triumphed over the will of his profession, and he was encouraged by various forces, and then resolutely gave up his profession and devoted himself to the refinement of the art of painting. He went to France in 1928 to study for three years, and returned to China last December. Last autumn, his work was exhibited at the "Imperial Art Exhibition" and was nominated for "Special Selection." Some of his works have been purchased and collected by famous people... Mr. Suzuki, who shifted from medicine to art, and is grasping solid strength to open up his artistic realm, is indeed a unique figure in the current Japanese Western-style painting world... I feel delighted by his attitude of pursuing his creative work with a pure love for art, and I also find it admirable.</p>

<h3 id="e123">After Returning <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Drunk, not knowing where to go, I sleep hazily in the shadow of the green pines—</p>
<p>These are the last two lines of a verse that Huang, who had once disappeared and recently returned from afar, showed us at the New Asia welcome party the day before yesterday. He drew it at a temple in Huishan, Wuxi. Because this event left such a deep impression on me, I can't forget it, especially these two meaningful lines of verse.</p>
<p>Huang's disappearance this time was really too abrupt. He left without a word. Even his closest friend, Mo, didn't know anything about it beforehand. Regarding his unusual action, I only know that in the moment before he left, he hurriedly handed a small and very scribbled note to his sister, Ying, who had just finished class. Then, the hearts of all of Huang's friends were stirred by this note, because it reported to us an abrupt fact. It was scribbled with a few lines of pencil writing:</p>
<p>"Classmate Wenying, now I report to you a piece of news about me, whether it is fortunate or unfortunate. That is, I have decided to leave from now on. Life is originally vast and indistinct, and because of this, vagueness is life. Love can save people, but it can also kill people, because it is ultimately a stage in the vast and indistinct journey of life. Now I want to thoroughly complete this vague task of my life. In fact, aren't all things in the universe like this? Because you know more about everything about me, I'm telling you this. I don't want to say more here. Please don't worry about me, and please forward this to other friends. Goodbye, Huang XX, X Month X Day."</p>
<p>So, because of the report in this note, all of us friends who cared about Huang were very busy doing the work of finding and inquiring about Huang. Among them, those who felt particularly sad and miserable were, of course, Miss Zhang and Shen, who loved Huang in the local area. But what was the result? We were all filled with disappointment. Huang ultimately disappeared like a wild goose into the dark sky, a stone sinking into the sea. We couldn't get any news or trace of him. We could only helplessly pray for good news to descend from heaven in a state of anxiety and disappointment.</p>
<p>After nearly ten days of such waiting, suddenly, one afternoon, Mo came to our residence with a look of joy that he rarely had. He came to report to us the news that Huang had returned! This, you can imagine, how happy and comforted we were. So we all rushed to Huang's house and invited him to New Asia for a snack, to have a hearty reunion after the separation. And at the same time, we also got to see the heroines in this tragicomedy, Miss Zhang and Shen.</p>
<p>The problems that young people feel most distressed about now are, of course, the problems of career and love. Because these two problems cannot be solved, young people often take risks and stage many tragedies, but what is the result? They still can't be solved. This is really a problem that has a huge impact on the life of society and the country and urgently needs to be solved. This time, our Huang's departure was also because he felt that his love problem could not be solved. But what made Huang different from others was that he didn't leave because of a broken heart. He left because he was under attack from two women who were very passionate about him. Really, Miss Zhang and Miss Shen were both very worthy of being loved. So how can you blame Huang for being at a loss and not knowing what to do? But according to Huang himself, he was very much in love with Shen, even though he had loved Zhang before, and Zhang still loves him, forgetting herself, and it is generally recognized by the society that he and Zhang are a future couple, but he always only loves Shen. This is really an unsolvable case.</p>
<p>When we arrived at New Asia, we happily ate the dishes while we freely discussed everything that had happened since our separation. In these conversations, we all felt a new vitality dancing in our heads. Until almost halfway through the drinking, Huang stood up excitedly, holding a glass filled to the brim with wine. With a very firm yet very desolate expression, he said the following words to us:</p>
<p>"My friends, come on, let's all drain this full glass. Today is the beginning of our new life, and it is also the beginning of your new life. Everything in the past has become a thing of the past. Let's just let it pass. But let's not let the coming future slip away lightly before our eyes. We must firmly grasp it. Pessimism, negativity, decadence, world-weariness, these are only found in the mouths of people who are useless. I am now awake. I know these are not very worthwhile. These are not the solutions we are seeking. These are just a trap of self-indulgence. Now, friends, we should all strive to pursue the acquisition of our light, and then we can proceed to solve other problems. This is the right way. Friends, let's all work together!"</p>
<p>Originally, everyone's heart was very peaceful and happy, but after listening to his firm tone and the words that would touch our hearts, our hearts were gradually assimilated by him. We only felt that on the leaves of our hearts, a taste suddenly floated up that we couldn't distinguish as sweet, sour, bitter, or spicy. It was truly a unique taste in our hearts. After we finished listening to his words, no one said anything, just looked at each other and smiled knowingly, and drank the full cup very painfully. Ah, this situation, it is impossible to describe and express with clumsy words and languages. Only those who are personally present can understand it.</p>
<p>On the way back, I only hoped for and worried about the friend after returning, Huang, the friend of new life.</p>
