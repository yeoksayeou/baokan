<h3 id="c61">太平洋國際學會之回顧與前瞻（二續）彬 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>（二）太平洋國際學會之起源與第一第二兩届大會述概</p>
<p>太平洋國際學會之所以組織。是在國民以個人資格討論太平洋沿岸各國國際間之癥結。謀太平洋各國家各民族之互相了解。以求敦進國際間之睦誼。進而謀世界永久之和平爲初衷。在該會組織法中。曾略述其成立緣起。中有云。「研究太平洋各民族底情形。以改良他們相互間的關係爲目的。「而在該會一九二八年九月出版之「太平洋國交討論會」中。又有謂。本會具有一種動力。經過私人之手。去研究和解釋太平洋各國底思想。文化。和制度。又去考察和補救各國各民族間的衝突。提倡他們互相了解。互相尊敬的文化。又謂。「爲達到上列目的起見。本會享有科學研究的利益。和衷共濟。互相探討。不被官塲態度所束縛。外交情勢所限制。所以本會是人民的組織。而並非是政府的結合。所注意的亦在搜求太平洋内維持和平的根據。又以坦白誠懇的態度交換各國和各民族間的意見。而解釋這種根據。」就以文字上所宣示者而觀。則該會之發起。在國際和平之意義上。吾人可以視爲國際間一促進和平之團體。爲歐戰後國際間國民組織之剏舉。同時亦可視爲一種能以坦白態度求各民族間之互相了解以打破太平洋上險惡情勢之國民外交。實開國際關係上之新紀元。其始意實可謂爲至美至善。</p>
<p>太平洋國際學會之發起。始萌於基督敎中人士。歐戰告終。曾有在檀香山召集太平洋各國青年會之提議。旋擴大範圍。一變而爲太平洋各國基督敎會之召集。繼又破除敎會界限。再變而爲純粹之國民會議。首由檀香山商學界重要領袖倡議。商及其他各關係國之學者名流發起。於一九二五年七月一日在檀香山開第一次會議。一九二七年七月十五日再在檀香山開第二次會議。一九二九年十月二十八日在日本西京開第三次會議。</p>
<p>至於該會之國際組織。其最高權力機關爲太平洋評議會。由太平洋參與各國之評議會各推代表一人組織之。次之則爲總秘書處。中設有秘書長一人。研究部會議部報告部等秘書各若干人。再次則爲國際研究委員會。由與會各國評議中研究委員之代表組織之。至於與會國家之組織。則稱爲太平洋國交討論會之各國評議會。有自主之權。在國際會議中决定議案與程序時。并有對等之力量。其整個組織系統列如下表。</p>
<p>該會之緣起及組織略如前述。今更將該會第一及第二兩届大會之概况。特列簡表如左。</p>
<p>次數　　　　　第一届大會　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　第二届大會</p>
<p>名稱　　　　　太平洋國民會議後改名太平洋國交討論會　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　太平洋國交討論會</p>
<p>日期　　　　　一九二五年七月一日至十五日　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九二七年七月十五日至二十八日</p>
<p>到會代表國　　到有中國·日本·美國·坎拿大·澳大利亞·紐西蘭·夏威夷·小吕宋·等九處代表　　　　　　　　到有澳大利亞·坎拿大·中國·英國·夏威夷·日本·韓國·紐西蘭·菲律賓·美國·等地代表一百三十六人</p>
<p>中國代表人選　羅有節·王季玉·温世珍·顧子仁·陳達·陳立庭·晏陽初·歐陽心農·李紹昌·林國芳·等十二人　鮑明鈐·陳立庭·郝伯陽·洪業·顧子仁·李紹昌·劉鴻生·林國芳·牛惠生·牛徐蘅·王廖奉獻·黄福民·余日章·陳衡哲等十四人</p>
<p>重要議題　　　中國代表提出之「治外法權」「關稅自主」「僑民問題」及外人提出之「發展實業」等問題爲此次會議之主要議題　關於中國之「關稅自主」及「治外法權」。與上海公共租界之收回。爲此次會議討論之中心問題。他如敎育移民勞工及太平洋之新外交。亦均有詳細研討。　　討論情况　　　（一）德奥俄等國對治外法權均覺巳無存在之必要。惟有少數國家尚藉口須待中國法制有成效及中國有强固之中央政府時。治外法權始可撤廢（二）對我關稅自主與稅率之增加。會衆感認爲必要。尤以美代表爲最同情。</p>
<p>（三）對於僑民問題完全採納我國代表之提案（四）對於實業問題一致主張尊重中國主權與人道爲合理之投資使中國實業得有充分發展之機會</p>
<p>（一）於原則上一致贊成中國關稅自主。但在實施方面。則仍有限制。至於各國方面之態度。殊不一致。英國似較爲易於承認。而美日則均以修訂條約爲前提。（二）對於領事裁判權解决之方法有兩種建議。一爲可以立刻施行之過度計劃。一爲待中國正式政府成立時。即刻採用的計劃。此種計劃均頗周詳。（三）對於收回上海公共租界。主張應由中國政府指派一大上海之中國巿政行政當局對於現存六區（南巿法租界公共租界江灣閘北吳淞）之一切公共之巿政事務。負行政職責。他如公共租界華董與非華董之同數。公共租界内巿長由董事會推舉等。亦均有詳密之商榷。</p>
<p>觀右表審知該會對於吾國各種問題十分重視。各國代表於商討時亦多能作平情之論。惟以韓國在第一次大會中因反對日本對韓侵略政策之專横。卒被拚於會外。美國代表以二十八人之多數。出席會議。而小吕宋代表則僅三人而巳。至於北婆羅洲與荷屬東印度之要求加入而被拒。臺灣·新加坡迄無代表參加。凡此種種。實爲該會重大之缺點。以該會爲謀民族親善與政治上之諒解爲目的者。尤宜無分畛域。一視同仁。以公平誠摯之態度。對於各種問題爲客觀之探討。庶足以有補於太平洋國際間之親善。而爲世界和平之倡導也。（未完）</p>

<p>昨晨雙方談判内容丶據王外長語本報記者丶重光對鮮人排華事件丶除傳達日政府之意旨丶及表示遺憾及歉意外丶且進一步講求善後補救之策丶詳細内容丶有關外交秘密丶恕不能相告丶至中日其他各種懸案丶重光亦略有提及丶將來仍繼續交涉丶决不因鮮事有所延緩也丶王氏又謂丶朝鮮我國總領事館確未被毁丶可以負責聲明云云丶</p>

<p>日代使重光丶於會見王外長後丶對日本記者團發表談話云丶晨間會晤王外交部長丶商談鮮人排華事件丶至談話詳細内容丶在未徵得雙方同意以前丶不能有所發表丶要言之丶余首先根據日本政府迄今日止所得之報告丶將事件之真相丶加以詳細說明丶今次不幸事件爲一種突發事件丶若因之而引起中日兩國關係惡化丶殊非雙方之利丶至鮮事善後處置問題丶雙方决一致基於從前良好之關係丶洽謀妥善之道丶又中國方面提出之抗議丶巳轉呈日政府矣云云丶</p>

<p>蜘絲馬跡不無可疑</p>
<p>調查後再正式交涉</p>
<p>財部業巳匯欵救濟</p>
<p>關於朝鮮排華事件丶各方均謂發縱指使丶另有其人丶外交部長王正廷丶昨晨在外交部辦事處丶接見各報記者時丶記者即以是項問題相詢丶</p>
<h3 id="c138">私人揣測 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>王氏答稱丶依佘個人私人的揣測而言丶鮮人暴動案丶表面係萬寳山案所引起丶但何以在朝鮮境内相距甚遥之各城巿丶在二十四小時内丶同時發生暴動丶則其有準備可知丶否則决無若是凑巧之理丶惟在事實無確切證據以前丶余對此未便發表任何意見丶</p>
<h3 id="c139">責任問題 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>外部巳令駐日汪榮寳公使丶即往朝鮮調查暴動之真相丶藉以明了責任問題丶倘確有背景丶則殺害我僑胞丶旣屬主使丶是非是有公論丶即或不然丶則日本當局之保護不力丶自亦難辭其咎丶故我方應俟汪公使調查事畢丶返國報告後丶再提正式交涉丶</p>
<h3 id="c140">死傷確數 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>我國旅韓僑胞死傷數丶尚無確實統計丶截止現在丶綜合各方之報告丶死者約爲八九十人丶重傷者一百餘人丶預料此三數日中丶當有確數公佈丶外部昨接張總領事報告丶謂韓人暴動丶大部份巳停止丶惟在鄉間恐仍間有發生丶關於僑胞善後處置問題丶救急辦法丶巳由財部匯欵至韓丶設法救濟丶各地約數千元不等丶</p>

<p>王外長又謂丶外傳外部尚未抗議丶可謂太缺乏常識丶蓋外部自接到報告後丶即按國際慣例丶一方令汪公使在日丶向幣原外相提出抗議丶同時用余名義丶致書日代使重光抗議丶日政府日内定有正式答覆丶</p>
<h3 id="c142">截然兩事 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>

<p>萬寳山事件丶曲直最易判明丶即以雙方均屬華人而言丶苟甲方掘溝侵及乙方農田時丶乙方爲顧全本身之利益丶勢必力爭丶即政府因公益而欲圈劃民田者丶亦必須與以相當之代價丶矧今之甲方丶爲一異國人丶蠻不講理丶一至於斯丶可謂不近人情者矣丶</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>新近美國有一僑商名約翰蘇寗。與其情人鄔施女士。舉行美滿之婚禮。賀客羣集中。有盛談其經過之趣事者。聆者莫不失笑。蓋蘇寗非他。乃一度不名一錢而偷渡大西洋之怪客也。</p>
<p>蘇寗英籍。少年時腦海中頗多奇想。在常人觀之。每譏其爲難成事實。但蘇寗不顧焉。戀一女曰鄔施。因家嗇於財。遲不能成婚。羡美國之富。欲往覓職業。俾償素願。然一經請求。不祗移民條例及護照手續處處加以阻難。即船資一項。當時蘇寗搜索所有。亦不敷尋常舖位之價也。失望之餘。蘇寗並不灰心。時適遇某輪渡海赴美。所裝貨物。有鋼琴木箱一具。容積甚大。足以藏匿。蘇乃預購食品飲料。潛伏其中。此木箱類似棺柩。存放艙面。無動之者。蘇竟得安然以渡大西洋矣。</p>
<p>迨抵美國之紐約。經海關人員之查騐。而蘇寗蹤踪頓時發現。以其行動詭異。紐約人莫不詫而加以注意。幸有某晨報館經理聞其事。嘉其有志。便執務於館中。未幾蘇之情人鄔施。亦偕其姊海倫聯袂來美。轉輾相值。遂正式完姻。現在蘇寗操業於雕刻公司。進益頗豐。與鄔施共度其甜蜜生治。查不費川資之旅行。亦事屬常有。如電影明星霍斯德。曾願自充某輪女侍。由英免費以至加拿大。又辛博森所存祇八先令。亦能往返美德。作長途遊歷。不過若上述蘇寗之隱身偷渡。究爲創聞。斯固值得一記者也。</p>

<p>江北某地。有老嫗王姓。智巧高人一等。歛錢之術甚精。蓋女巫也。聞其自三十歲起。即成孀婦。無所出。甚貧困。賴母家津貼以活。旋其母亦逝。津貼頓絶。適左鄰有一巫媪。所入至豐。嫗羡之。遂從之學。盡得其傳。媪旣死。嫗繼其衣鉢。謂有神附身。爲人卜休咎治病。更從他人學得推拿術。頗有效。醫名竟出媪上。行之四十年。遠近震其名。求醫求卜者。日必數十起。嫗雖聲言不計金錢。而一醫一卜之代價。則日益增高。故積資甚巨。嫗自奉極儉。布衣蔬食。甘之如飴。有延之至家醫治者。勿論遠近。必徒步而往。儼若貧婦。詢之。則曰。神所諭。不敢違也。實則嗜錢如命。不肯耗費而己。然其積有巨資。則知之者綦衆。綁匪早巳垂涎。一日。有一少婦來。滿面戚容。見嫗即跽而泣曰。夫病垂危。百藥罔效。求神大發慈悲。降臨我家嫗爲惻然。扶之起。詢得姓氏居址。曰。爾先去。我處尚有數人待神賜方。事畢即來可也。婦稱謝而去。約一時許。嫗事巳了。即徒步而往。旣入門。見有一面貌猙惡之大漢在。不見來延之少婦。疑非病家。方欲返身出。大漢止之曰。爾王嫗乎。勿去。嫗聞聲愕然。一瞬之間。便知不妙。從容答曰。即此家有病人乎。然則我好去報知主人來也。大漢諦視嫗面。曰。爾何言者。嫗曰。我王嫗之僕也。適有一婦延我主人醫病。因所詢居址。似未聽清。恐有誤。命我先來問明。果此家有病人求醫。則我主人一得歸報。少頃即至矣。大漢復諦視嫗面有頃。曰。旣悉居址。何待問明。爾其速趣王嫗來。嫗諾諾返身出。心雖忐忑。步履不亂。出其門後。始急步而歸。蓋此大漢果係綁票匪。誘王嫗入彀者。匪不識嫗。識嫗之匪又適在後進屋内。即此宅主人。大漢則爲此宅主人之首領。以爲嫗擁巨資。服御必精。觀嫗旣衣粗服。正類僕傭。所言又毫無吞吐狀。顯非察破後之飾詞。且匪固自信未爲察破也。則當時王嫗之隨機應變。其從容鎮定。洵非常人所可及矣。</p>

<p>韓國青年。留學歐美及中國的。爲數不少。他們不願意在國内受人支配和侮辱。惟有向外發展。可是很不幸的。即使學問成功了。還是格於勢。不能回國。回了國。也無所用其學。這話怎麽說呢。大概他們海外歸來的。不消說的。思想進步了。識見廣博了。想到人家如何國富民强。愈感覺自巳一切都落後。眼裏看不過去。言語·行動就隨時會流露出失望·悲憤·反抗·的態度。而日本密探。最注意他們的行動。在他們進口的時候。巳先暗中監視。只等你有那種類似宣傳的表示。立刻報告警察署。定他一個罪名。呌做「思想犯」逮捕下獄。監禁三月五月以至三年兩年。那是没有一定的。此種情形。韓國留學生早巳忍無可忍的了。其次比較有奴性的留學生。雖然可以自由。而很難生活。日人提防他們會造反·起革命。所以儘管是埋没英才。有一位德國回來的工業家。找不到職業。政府支配他進一家日本印刷所去充任校對。月給二十元薪俸。他屈就三月。忍不住了。還是跑到外國去謀生。所以韓國留學生。一到海外。便不想回國再過地獄生活了。</p>
<p>朝鮮最高行政機關是總督府。它的組織。在總督之下。爲政務總監。府内分財務·法務·學務·警務·内務·殖産等六局。農林·土地改良二部。此外遞信·鐵道。專賣等三獨立局。也歸總督直轄。在總督府内的官員。完全爲日人。全境分京畿道·忠清北道。忠清南道。全羅北道。全羅南道。慶尚北道·慶尚南道·黄海道·平安南道平安北道·江原道·咸鏡北道。咸鏡南道。這十三道的道知事。只有三分之一是朝鮮人。而且都是親日派的人物。道署内警務·財務·内務三項實權。全操日人之手。他們原來是拿一頂高帽子給韓人戴。籠絡民心的玩意兒罷了。</p>
<p>中樞院是朝鮮最高的諮詢機關僅有建議權·發言權·而無表决權。本年日本政府令總督府籌備地方自治初步。組織道議會·府議會·郡議會及島議會。議會。議長可以兼任地方官。自四月一日起轟轟烈烈。全境實行大選舉。在漢城到處看見候補議員的布牌。豎立在十字路口。多數是日本人。這次被選舉的資格。以財産做標準。結果韓人只佔百分之六的位置。而議會勢力。仍爲日人所操縱。一般革命志士。雖高唱「民族自决」「韓國獨立」的口號。（這是韓人暗中的活動·可見諸於刋物·尚不能當衆呼喊的）。至今還是一個幻夢。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>你「看；這麽樣？」</p>
<p>「到車站上去接伊麽？</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「不！」</p>
<p>「打扮得像泥菩薩那麽一個，坐在家裏，算什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「我家裏，連大的着衣鏡也没有一面，否則自巳看得見自巳了，」</p>
<p>伊說罷，下樓去了，子良聽得開門聲，一定是伊到門外去迎接了，子良預想着葉韵玉女士將到，曉得伊們兩個人鬧起來，我今天休想能夠動筆，所以戰戰兢兢，宛如大難臨頭，要趁伊未到，先趕緊改去幾本作文簿，然而心頭亂跳，那裏再能夠用腦呢？</p>
<p>忽然間一陣笑聲，從弄堂裏進來，葉韵玉到了，伊們俩在客堂裏，聲音很鬧，先把黄包車夫，駡了一頓，然後月如吩咐娘姨去買麵，韵玉不許娘姨去，三個人鬧了好一會。</p>
<p>「你飯也没有吃，肚子一定餓了。」</p>
<p>這是夫人的聲音。</p>
<p>「我不餓丨我在火車上，吃過一客火腿士司，一杯牛奶，那裏還吃得下什麽東西？」</p>
<p>知了女士，嚮喉嚨無恙，聲音依舊很高。</p>
<p>但是無法辜負主人的好意，娘姨到底去買麵了。歇了一會，笑聲又作，子良細細一聽，方知知了女士帶來一對板鴨，送給夫人，夫人和伊推來推去，不肯受，推到後來，大約夫人怕弄髒身上衣服，就此不推了。</p>
<p>吃完了麵，閑談幾句，忽然樓梯上有聲音了，子良慌忙把亭子間的門，輕輕一關，不好，伊們兩個人上了樓，並不到亭子間裏來驚動子良，是到前面房裏去的，子良曉得這是女子到人家去少不了的一種禮節。</p>
<p>在葉女士解手的時候，忽然月如推門進來，輕輕對子良說：</p>
<p>「你這麽躱在這裏？來了客人，應當出去敷衍幾句啊。」</p>
<p>「我今天那裏還有工夫！」</p>
<p>伊倒問起你的，你想我難爲情不難爲情？我只得說你今天身子有些不舒服了。」</p>

<p>下季世界消費難增</p>
<p>紐約十日來電報告一週中之棉巿云丶棉巿因債戰問題協定丶而激起之一度買進之後丶即形鬆軟丶而銳跌繼之丶蓋以政府棉田報告利於空頭丶而新花進行亦屬滿意之故也丶棉帶之東中西三部丶均巳獲得甘霖丶而目前温度亦屬至高丶大概預料下季世界之美棉消費丶不至超過一千二百五十萬包丶故羣以爲氣候順利丶則棉收必豐丶不過同時亦有人以爲新花巳入危險時期丶而許多專家·意想在戰債細目議定之後丶世界商業必有起色丶或亦可以增進全世界對於美棉消費之估計也云丶</p>

<p>Instructing Shigemitsu to Deliver to Foreign Minister Wang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Hua, acting Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters this afternoon that the Japanese side has not yet formally replied to our country's protest regarding the Korean incident. Currently, Ambassador Wang, stationed in Japan, is scheduled to go to Korea within days to investigate everything. Regarding the burning of the Chinese Consulate General in Seoul, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received a report. At 7:00 PM on the 10th, a telegram was received from Consul General Zhang Weicheng, only inquiring whether the government would send a senior official to Korea. It did not mention the Seoul incident, which seems inaccurate. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government, regarding the National Government's protest on the 7th regarding the Korean incident, at 4:00 PM today, instructed Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu to personally deliver the official reply to Foreign Minister Wang. The contents roughly stated: 1. Expressing apology for the unfortunate incident that occurred in Korea this time. Hereafter, efforts will be made to protect the lives and properties of Chinese residents in Korea. 2. The cause of this incident originated from the oppression of Koreans in Manchuria. It is hoped that the two governments will negotiate and fundamentally resolve the issue of Koreans in Manchuria. 3. The Japanese government does not consider itself responsible for compensation for the Korean incident. However, depending on the extent of the actual loss, the Governor-General of Korea will provide relief to the bereaved families and victims, and will severely punish the perpetrators according to national law.

<p>Our Side is Currently Collecting Materials for Negotiations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Incheon Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, stating that the riots are increasingly expanding, the market is unstable, and the Chinese street is temporarily unaffected. The whole city is on strike. Also, the Gyeongseong (Seoul) Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, stating that someone is behind this riot, and the properties of Chinese residents are in danger. Business has been suspended, especially in Gyeongseong (Seoul) and Incheon. The spread to other ports is not diminishing. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign affairs circles report that the anti-Chinese wave in Korea has slightly calmed down. Our side is currently collecting all important materials. After Ambassador Wang returns to Nanjing from his investigation in Korea, we will formally lodge a protest with Japan. Furthermore, our country's consulates in Korea have sent detailed telegrams reporting the extent of the damage. These reports will be used as the basis for future negotiations. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after the anti-Chinese case occurred in Korea, various Korean government offices intended to send condolence money and supplies to the Chinese refugees in distress. Our country's Consul General in Korea, Zhang Weicheng, urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting instructions on whether to accept it. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhongkui, a representative of the Chinese Chambers of Commerce in Incheon and Gyeongseong (Seoul), Korea, petitioned the Ministry of Industry regarding the case of Koreans brutally killing Chinese residents. Recently, the Ministry of Industry has sent a dispatch to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to seriously negotiate, immediately stop the atrocities, and protect overseas Chinese, while ordering arrangements for the aftermath to preserve diplomatic relations. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>(Andong) The situation in various parts of Korea is now stable. As of last night, all 1,600 Chinese residents who had taken refuge in Andong had returned to Sinuiju. Chinese stores in Andong reopened together yesterday, and the city has returned to its normal state. (Dentsu Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Seoul) In various provinces of Korea, regarding the Chinese who suffered as a result of the recent riots by Koreans, they have begun to organize the damaged residences, send medical treatment, and provide clothing and food, which are the current relief methods. The Social Affairs Section of the Korean Governor-General's Office, with the assistance of the Japanese Red Cross Society and the Korean branch of the Patriotic Women's Association, is raising donations nationwide. The relevant authorities and the Social Affairs Section have reached a concrete agreement on methods of relief for the affected Chinese residents, with the aim of not leaving out anything. (Dentsu Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Seiyukai Questions Diplomatic Weakness <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Shidehara Replied that He Had Made the Utmost Effort</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Representatives of the Seiyukai, including Kodama Uji and six other Diet members, visited Foreign Minister Shidehara at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon. Representing the opinion of the Seiyukai, they said: "The unfortunate incident that occurred in Korea this time is due to the weak diplomacy of Foreign Minister Shidehara. We believe that its guilt is the result of weak diplomacy. Because the ignorant Korean masses were angered by the unfair oppression of Koreans in Manchuria by the Chinese authorities, they temporarily erupted, leading to this tragedy. Not only this Wanpaoshan incident, but also the issue of disagreement over the ambassador to China and other issues, the current cabinet's diplomacy toward China has been weak, which greatly damages the prestige of the Japanese Empire. What is Foreign Minister Shidehara's belief in upholding the special interests of Manchuria and Mongolia? Please tell us clearly." Shidehara replied: "The government's diplomacy toward China has made the utmost effort. No one in charge could have done more. Japan and China are neighboring countries and stand on a special relationship of friendship. Such an unfortunate incident should be handled with friendly feelings and the best methods." The six Diet members did not pursue the matter further. (Dentsu Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Outrages of Koreans Deeply Enraged All Countries <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>There is Suspicion that Japanese Police Encouraged It</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British and American sources received reports from Korea stating that as of the evening of the 10th, about 200 Chinese residents in various cities had been brutally killed, and twice as many had been injured. Japanese reports also stated that nearly 100 people had been killed. The Japanese police officers were not without encouragement beforehand, but when the situation became serious, they took measures to suppress and contain it. However, Chinese consulates in various places do not have accurate registrations of Chinese residents, so the number of missing people is still difficult to determine. Furthermore, most of the patrol assistants hired by the Japanese are Koreans, and there is indeed evidence of them assisting the rioters. Japanese officials have already admitted their fault for this incident. However, whether it will be negotiated separately in connection with the Wanpaoshan case will be a point of contention between the two countries. Other countries are very angry at the barbarism of the Koreans, and at the same time saddened by China's plight. It is also reported that in various ports in Hamgyeongbuk-do (North Hamgyong Province), Korea, such as Hoeryong, Chongjin, and Seongjin, Chinese residents who fled to the north bank of the Tumen River were driven back by Korean people from northern China who were cultivating land. They are now living in the open air in the Musan Pass area, in a very miserable situation. A portion has already taken ships from Chongjin to Vladivostok to seek refuge. The Russian side sent personnel to the pier to provide coarse food. It is strange that on the north bank of the Tumen River, which is Chinese territory, the number of Korean households exceeds the number of Chinese households by several times, causing the Chinese refugees to be unable to return to their country. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Various Parties Urge Negotiations <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters has received more than 40 telegrams from provincial and municipal party headquarters in the past three days, strongly demanding serious negotiations on the case of Koreans killing Chinese residents. The people are willing to be the backing, and there are serious exhortations to the diplomatic authorities. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Various groups in Changchun organized a diplomatic association to support the Wanpaoshan case. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Various circles in Beijing issued a circular telegram on the 10th regarding the Wanpaoshan incident: (1) Request the central government to negotiate seriously with Japan. (2) Send a circular telegram to the whole country to support it unanimously. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the entire committee of the provincial government and the secretary-general telegraphed the National Government, stating: "All nationals share the righteous indignation over the Wanpaoshan case. We, the officials, love the country and the people, and dare not lag behind others. We earnestly request that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be instructed to negotiate seriously with the Japanese side in order to stop it and provide relief." (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications received a telegram from the Northeast Political Committee stating that the "Eurasia No. 1" aircraft arrived in Manchuria at 11:00 AM on the 6th. When it was about to take off, Peiping had not yet received the telegram from the "No. 2" aircraft, which was supposed to arrive in Manchuria last Thursday. Therefore, this aircraft also had the mission of investigating the whereabouts of the "No. 2" aircraft. After a detailed investigation along the line, when it reached the south bank of Bel Lake, it saw the "No. 2" landing there. It immediately circled for investigation and planned to land for rescue. Unexpectedly, there were more than 50 Soviet troops under the aircraft at this time, who immediately opened fire. The aircraft was damaged in more than 20 places by bullets and one place by artillery shells. Fortunately, the vital parts were not damaged, so it was still able to reach Manchuria as usual. Although the situation of the "No. 2" aircraft landing on the south bank of Bel Lake could not be fully determined, it was probably also caused by being shot down. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>Kong Xiangxi Plans to See Him Off Personally</p>
<p>(Peiping) A certain important person from Shanxi said that Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun urgently want Feng Yuxiang to go abroad because the troops of Song and Pang are squeezed into southern Shanxi and are extremely poor. Feng, who lives among them, secretly interferes, creating many obstacles in the exercise of power. Therefore, Song Zheyuan spends very little time in the defense area and more time in Taiyuan. Feng Yuxiang recently realized this and deeply repented. Recalling that after the defeat of the 300,000 troops, he was betrayed and abandoned. Now, what can he do with this small number of old troops? Since everyone treats me with respect, why should I lose all this respect? Therefore, he recently stated that he is willing to go abroad. Song and Pang, upon hearing this, strongly encouraged him, hoping that he would leave as soon as possible. They are working to coordinate with all parties. Kong Xiangxi plans to see him off personally. There is no question about travel expenses. He Qigong and others are willing to accompany him. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Japanese Government Responds to Protest <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Japanese news agency reports that Foreign Minister Shidehara, based on the cabinet's decision, officially instructed Shigemitsu to respond to China's protest. In addition to acknowledging relief for the injured and punishment for the perpetrators, it was stated that the Korean Governor-General's Office's methods of suppression in response to this sudden storm were not improper. Therefore, it is believed that the Japanese government has no international legal responsibility for this case. We dare not prejudge whether the content is true. If it is as stated, then what could be more strange? Koreans organized such a large-scale riot, which lasted for several days. The Governor-General's Office never heard of any suppression until the Chinese residents were burned and battered and the Koreans had exhausted their intentions before slowly sending police to stop it. Even if this kind of situation is not considered intentional connivance and instigation, it should at least be considered negligence and dereliction of duty, losing the ability to govern. How can the Governor-General's Office not be held responsible for improper handling? Since Korea is governed by the Japanese government, the lives and property of Chinese residents have been harmed so severely. How can the Japanese government not bear considerable international responsibility and provide compensation? But it is glossed over, as if it were insignificant. We cannot help but express our deep regret.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Shidehara replied to the Seiyukai Diet members today regarding the question of weak diplomacy, saying that the government's diplomacy towards China has made the utmost effort, and that such an unfortunate incident should be handled with friendly feelings and the best methods. We really do not know what the so-called utmost effort is, and what the best methods are. We also do not know what techniques are used to promote friendly feelings between the two countries. If it is as stated in the response to the protest, we dare not consider it the best handling, nor do we dare to consider this method sufficient to promote friendly feelings between the people of the two countries.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Zhou Zhongliang's Daughter Goes to the National Government to Attempt Suicide <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Zhongliang Resigns to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Yinghui, the daughter of Zhou Zhongliang, Director of the National Government Printing Bureau, went to the National Government at 7:00 this morning, seeking to see Secretary-General Ye Chucang, and submitted a grievance petition. The reasons stated were that she was being abused by her stepmother and requested relief. The reception refused to allow her to see him. After repeated entreaties, the grievance petition and business card were submitted. Ye then sent a staff member to comfort her. The woman then stabbed herself in the neck several times in front of the assembly hall, with blood flowing all over the ground. At that time, the staff of the National Government were going to the government to work, and they were shocked to see this. They immediately telegraphed Zhou Zhongliang to come. Then, the government doctor sent someone to carry her to the Central Hospital on a canvas stretcher. Fortunately, the throat was not cut. After surgery, her life is not in danger. Zhou Zhongliang said that his daughter is 21 years old and has a strong personality. Previously, her stepmother prevented her from going to school, and she often felt uncomfortable. She then married Zi Dongsheng, who is currently at Daxinggong Elementary School. When he takes her out to play, she always feels partial treatment. This time, she was studying at Zhongnan Middle School, and a classmate recently got married. She asked for new clothes, but the materials were not good, and there was an argument. Her mother went to stay with relatives temporarily. She then went to her uncle Zhou Zhi's house, declaring that she wanted to commit suicide. I then took both my wife and daughter home and tried to persuade them. Unexpectedly, she did this this morning. I have already resigned to Secretary-General to take responsibility and have now submitted a supplementary statement. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>Luther, the president of the Deutsche Bank, returned to Berlin by plane at 10:40 this morning to discuss the political concessions proposed by France with Prime Minister Brüning. It is said that Moreau, the president of the Bank of France, told Luther that the German banking community had the power to help the government overcome the crisis. Luther replied that if German banks could recover funds deposited abroad, they could greatly assist the government.</p>

<p>After Luther, the president of the Deutsche Bank, returned to Berlin by plane this afternoon, he went to the Prime Minister's residence to report on the loan negotiations in Britain and France. The government has scheduled a cabinet meeting for 5 p.m., and Luther will also attend to provide a detailed report. As for the content, the authorities have not yet released it. It is reported that France is demanding political and economic concessions from Germany as conditions for granting loans. In political terms, it is demanding the abandonment of the German-Austrian customs union plan and the cancellation of the budget for the construction of the second pocket battleship. In economic terms, it is demanding that Germany first guarantee that the funds saved under the Hoover Plan will be used strictly for economic purposes. Second, Germany should agree to terminate the current Franco-German trade agreement. Third, the Deutsche Bank should impose stricter restrictions on lending. German public opinion is very indignant at this, and newspapers have unanimously pointed to France's attempt to severely damage the German people. Therefore, it is expected that today's cabinet meeting will not accept these conditions. However, political circles believe that the German government will not completely reject them, and it is expected that the German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will therefore travel to France early to persuade the French to reconsider their attitude.</p>

<p>Luther, the president of the Deutsche Bank, did not finish talking to key French figures until 5 p.m. today, but the repayment issue is still unclear. Mr. Luther is now planning to return to Germany by train tonight or tomorrow morning. When he finished negotiations and walked out of the French Foreign Ministry, he told the Associated Press that he did not know what would happen next or where he would go. It is rumored here that this afternoon, when Luther met with French Finance Minister Flandin, Flandin asked Germany to give up the German-Austrian customs union and stop building pocket battleships as conditions for French loans. However, if Germany were to implement this, it would immediately lead to the fall of the cabinet. Now that Britain and France have failed to provide financial assistance, it is expected that Luther will seek loans from the United States.</p>

<p>The German government today again explored with Washington whether the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and international banks could provide financial assistance to relieve the immediate crisis. At the same time, it is rumored that Luther's trip to Britain and France has yielded little results. It is also heard that British Foreign Secretary Henderson advised the German ambassador to Britain on Friday to ask the German Prime Minister to agree to abandon the German-Austrian customs union and stop building pocket battleships in order to improve Franco-German relations. It is said that France insists on this as a condition for lending to Germany. Today, foreign deposits in the Deutsche Bank have withdrawn between 30 million and 40 million marks.</p>
<h3 id="e42">National Society, Berlin, 10th <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The trip of Mr. Luther, President of the German National Bank, to France to negotiate loans has not only attracted the attention of the entire country but has also aroused various speculations. According to recent news from the French capital, the French government is quite willing to take advantage of the situation to achieve its own selfish desires. It requires political concessions as a condition for joining international lending groups. The German local guide newspaper reported that the first condition currently put forward by France is the abolition of the German-Austrian customs agreement, and the second is the cessation of the construction of pocket battleships of the same type as the Deutschland. The German Allgemeine Zeitung replied that France intends to force Germany to seriously recognize the inviolability of its eastern border. Therefore, the majority of German newspapers have expressed a united front in dealing with such means that insult the dignity of the German nation. According to the observation of the Central Party's organ newspaper Germania, the strategy currently adopted by France is the same as that used against Austria five weeks ago. At that time, Austria's international borrowing position was on the verge of collapse, so it consulted France, and France took the opportunity to use economic issues as a political weapon. It is said that there are countries in the world whose economic status is even more solid than that of France. If they were to treat others as they have been treated, they would dig a trap for themselves. However, what is strange is that a part of British public opinion is actually expressing sympathy with the French and is willing for Germany to cancel the construction of its pocket battleships. If Britain now relies on this kind of demand, it would be the opposite of the attitude of the Bank of England when it aided Austria in escaping the economic crisis a few days ago. However, all of the above are still being considered as an overestimation in the official field, and it is said that the current negotiations are proceeding smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Reuters, Berlin, 10th <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that Dr. Luther unexpectedly wanted to return to Berlin from Paris to discuss with the government the demands of French Finance Minister Flandin. Flandin advocated that Germany abandon the construction of battleships and the establishment of a German-Austrian alliance as conditions for France to provide financial assistance. However, before long, Luther changed his mind and decided to stay in Paris to continue negotiations. As for the statement by British Foreign Secretary Henderson to the German ambassador to Britain that Britain welcomes Germany to stop building warships and abandon the German-Austrian customs union, the German Foreign Ministry has neither admitted nor denied it. The Germans believe that if Germany agrees to France's demands, it will inevitably cause domestic unrest. Not only will the current government be overthrown, but Hitler's faction will rise to power, and there is fear that a communist counter-revolution will occur, leading to bloodshed. Luther was aware of this, so he initially planned to return home to consult, but after a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Brüning, he decided to stay in France and continue negotiations solely on financial matters, while leaving political matters to be handled by Brüning and Curtius. Therefore, the two men, Brüning and Curtius, have been very busy discussing the situation all day long.</p>

<p>Financial circles here expect that if the German National Bank restricts lending and commercial banks in various countries continue to lend to Germany, the Bank of England, the Bank of France, and the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank can immediately lend two to three hundred million dollars to the German National Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Dentsu News Agency, Paris, 10th <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Luther, the governor of the German Federal Bank, arrived in Paris this morning from London and immediately went to the Central Bank of France to visit Governor Moret. The talks lasted from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. In the afternoon, he visited French Finance Minister Flandin to exchange views on rescuing the German financial community. He left at 5:00 p.m. Before meeting the French Finance Minister, Luther said that he had scheduled to return to Berlin by special express train at 4:25 p.m., but after meeting with the Finance Minister, he revealed a pessimistic tone, saying, "I don't know what to do next or where to go, even I myself can't decide." It can be seen that the negotiations with the French Finance Minister have failed. On the one hand, the French Finance Minister immediately reported the meeting with Governor Luther to Prime Minister Laval. It is heard that the French Finance Minister advised Germany during the afternoon meeting that in order to rescue the German financial community from panic, it is hoped that the French credit system will first declare the abolition of the German-Austrian customs union and postpone the construction of the battleships in its pocket, so that France can be reassured as a prerequisite. Therefore, these two factors are obstacles to German-French reconciliation and a source of international suspicion. However, if Germany makes concessions on these two factors, it will be a direct cause of the dissolution of the current cabinet. Therefore, Governor Luther immediately rejected the proposal. Since Germany was unsuccessful in England and failed in France, it has only one way left: to seek assistance from the United States.</p>

<p>Today, Britain formally put the Hoover Plan into effect. The Foreign Office has sent a letter to the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, stating that Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and India have decided not to claim the conditional and unconditional reparations due on July 15, in order to relieve Germany's current difficulties in accordance with President Hoover's proposal. At the same time, the Foreign Office has also issued formal invitations to six countries—Japan, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, and Germany—to send representatives to attend the international conference in London on July 17 to comprehensively adjust the Hoover Plan and the Young Plan. In addition, it has formally explained the reasons for inviting the six countries, as these six countries were the original discussion countries of the Young Plan, and in order to quickly implement the Hoover Plan, other countries will no longer be invited to avoid delays.</p>

<p>Today, Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Rong Kui, representing the National Government, inquired with the U.S. State Department about whether President Hoover's one-year moratorium on war debts applies to the Chinese government's debts, especially the Boxer indemnity owed to Britain, the United States, France, and Japan. The U.S. State Department has now scheduled a meeting with Chargé d'Affaires Rong. If President Hoover believes that his plan can be applied to China, the State Department will discuss the matter with other governments, and among these countries, there will likely be negotiations with Japan. The Chinese and other people here mostly believe that China should also receive war debt treatment as in the case of Germany. State Department personnel are hoping that this matter will be determined definitively as soon as possible so that they can respond to Chargé d'Affaires Rong.</p>

<p>The U.S. Treasury Department sent a letter to the President of the Bank for International Settlements, stating that Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and India have accepted in principle President Hoover's proposal to suspend all intergovernmental debts, including reparations, due between July 1 and the end of June next year. There are still some outstanding issues related to the method of implementing the Hoover proposal that need to be resolved by the governments concerned. The amount that Germany should pay daily is due on July 15. Even if the German government can allocate this amount to meet the demand, it is clearly inconsistent with the move to accept the Hoover proposal in principle. Therefore, the above-mentioned governments have decided not to claim the payments due on July 15, whether they are conditional or unconditional payments. This move does not prejudice the rights of those who hold German 1924 foreign bonds and German 5.5% international bonds of 1930. As for the conditions for the payment suspension and how the suspended payments will be disbursed in the future, all will be subject to consultation and agreement among the countries. The above-mentioned governments also need to declare that their decision is intended to fully suspend the payment of current money and goods in accordance with the Hoover proposal, so as to immediately relieve Germany's existing difficulties. Of course, it cannot be regarded as containing the</p>

<p>Wheat prices continue to fall, and the government is paying close attention. This can be seen in an article published by President Hoover. President Hoover asked speculators not to short sell in the wheat market any longer, saying that such actions would undermine public confidence and deprive many farmers of their legitimate income. If speculators have a little patriotism, they will no longer take this action.</p>

<p>The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Northern Pacific patrol vessel Shin Kotsu No. 9 detained a Russian fishing boat. The Russian ambassador has repeatedly requested its release, but due to strong suspicions of poaching, it was taken to Nemuro pending investigation. Decisive action will be taken. The Japanese government, because the Russian side has always detained Japanese fishing boats and sold them without investigation, intends to take this opportunity to thoroughly resolve the issue. Vice-Minister Nagai told the Russian Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Merenikov, today that the Russian fishing boat entered the non-open port of Horonobe Island and the oil bay without permission, so it was arrested, explaining the details of the situation.</p>

<p>(II) Origin of the Pacific International Society and Overview of the First and Second Conferences</p>
<p>The reason for organizing the Pacific International Society is that, as individuals, citizens can discuss the crux of international relations between countries along the Pacific coast and seek mutual understanding between the countries and peoples of the Pacific in order to promote international amity and, further, to seek permanent world peace as the initial intention. In the society's organizational law, the origin of its establishment was briefly described, stating, "To study the situation of the peoples of the Pacific and improve their mutual relations as the goal." In the "Pacific National Relations Discussion Conference" published by the society in September 1928, it also stated, "This society possesses a kind of driving force to study and interpret the ideas, culture, and systems of the Pacific countries through private hands, and to examine and remedy the conflicts between countries and peoples, and to promote their mutual understanding and respect for culture." It also stated, "In order to achieve the above objectives, the society enjoys the benefits of scientific research, cooperates sincerely, explores each other, and is not bound by official attitudes or limited by diplomatic situations. Therefore, the society is an organization of the people, not a combination of governments. What we pay attention to is also searching for the basis for maintaining peace in the Pacific, and exchanging opinions between countries and peoples with a frank and sincere attitude, and interpreting this basis." Judging from what is declared in words, the initiation of the society, in the sense of international peace, can be regarded as an international group promoting peace and a pioneering effort of national organizations in the international community after the European War. At the same time, it can also be regarded as a kind of national diplomacy that can seek mutual understanding between nations with a frank attitude in order to break the dangerous situation in the Pacific, truly opening a new era in international relations. Its initial intention can indeed be described as most beautiful and perfect.</p>
<p>The initiation of the Pacific International Society began with people in Christianity. After the end of the European War, there was a proposal to convene the YMCA of various Pacific countries in Honolulu. The scope was then expanded, changing to a convocation of Christian churches in the Pacific countries. Subsequently, the boundaries of the church were broken, changing again to a purely national conference. It was first advocated by important leaders in the business and academic circles of Honolulu, who consulted with scholars and celebrities from other related countries to initiate it. The first conference was held in Honolulu on July 1, 1925. The second conference was held in Honolulu on July 15, 1927. The third conference was held in Kyoto, Japan on October 28, 1929.</p>
<p>As for the international organization of the society, its highest authority is the Pacific Council, which is composed of one representative from each of the participating countries' councils in the Pacific. Next is the General Secretariat, which has a Secretary-General, and several secretaries in the Research Department, Conference Department, and Report Department. Next is the International Research Committee, which is composed of representatives of research members from the councils of the participating countries. As for the organization of the participating countries, it is called the National Councils of the Pacific National Relations Conference, which has the power of autonomy and equal power in deciding motions and procedures at international conferences. The entire organizational system is listed in the table below.</p>
<p>The origin and organization of the society are briefly described above. Now, a brief table is specially listed to provide an overview of the first and second conferences of the society, as follows.</p>
<p>Number First Conference Second Conference</p>
<p>Name Pacific National Conference, later renamed Pacific National Relations Conference Pacific National Relations Conference</p>
<p>Date July 1 to 15, 1925 July 15 to 28, 1927</p>
<p>Participating Countries Representatives from nine locations including China, Japan, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Little Luzon Representatives from Australia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, Hawaii, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United States, totaling 136 people</p>
<p>Chinese Representatives Luo Youjie, Wang Jiyu, Wen Shizhen, Gu Ziren, Chen Da, Chen Liting, Yan Yangchu, Ouyang Xinong, Li Shaochang, Lin Guofang, and 2 others Bao Mingqian, Chen Liting, Hao Boyang, Hong Ye, Gu Ziren, Li Shaochang, Liu Hongsheng, Lin Guofang, Niu Huisheng, Niu Xuheng, Wang Liaofengxian, Huang Fumin, Yu Rizhang, Chen Hengzhe, and 1 other</p>
<p>Important Issues The "Extraterritoriality," "Tariff Autonomy," and "Overseas Chinese Issues" proposed by the Chinese representatives and the "Development of Industry" proposed by foreigners were the main issues of this conference. The "Tariff Autonomy" and "Extraterritoriality" of China and the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement were the focus of discussions at this conference. Other issues such as education, immigration, labor, and the new diplomacy of the Pacific were also discussed in detail. Discussion Situation (1) Germany, Austria, Russia and other countries all felt that extraterritoriality was no longer necessary. However, a few countries still argued that extraterritoriality could only be abolished when China's legal system became effective and China had a strong central government. (2) The participants felt that tariff autonomy and increased tax rates were necessary for our country. The American representative was the most sympathetic.</p>
<p>(3) The proposals of our country's representatives were fully adopted on the issue of overseas Chinese (4) On the issue of industry, it was unanimously advocated that respect for China's sovereignty and humanity should be regarded as reasonable investment so that China's industry could be fully developed</p>
<p>(1) Unanimously agreed in principle to China's tariff autonomy. However, there were still restrictions on implementation. As for the attitudes of various countries, they were not consistent. The United Kingdom seemed more willing to recognize it, while the United States and Japan both took treaty revision as a prerequisite. (2) There were two suggestions for solving the problem of consular jurisdiction. One was an excessive plan that could be implemented immediately, and the other was a plan to be adopted immediately when the official government of China was established. These plans were quite detailed. (3) Regarding the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement, it was advocated that the Chinese government should appoint a Chinese municipal administrative authority for Greater Shanghai to be responsible for the administrative responsibilities of all public municipal affairs in the existing six districts (Nanshi French Concession International Settlement Jiangwan Zhabei Wusong). Other matters, such as the equal number of Chinese and non-Chinese directors in the International Settlement and the mayor in the International Settlement being elected by the board of directors, were also discussed in detail.</p>
<p>Observing the table on the right, it can be seen that the society attaches great importance to various issues in our country. Representatives from various countries were also able to make fair remarks during discussions. However, because Korea opposed Japan's tyrannical policy of aggression against Korea in the first conference, it was eventually excluded from the conference. The American representatives attended the meeting with a large majority of twenty-eight people, while the representatives of Little Luzon were only three. As for the requests of North Borneo and the Dutch East Indies to join being rejected, and no representatives from Taiwan and Singapore participating, all of these are major shortcomings of the society. As the society aims to promote national friendship and political understanding, it should be inclusive and treat all equally. With a fair and sincere attitude, an objective exploration of various issues can contribute to the friendship between Pacific countries and promote world peace. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Stays in Beiping for One Night and Immediately Returns to Shenyang</p>
<p>Talks About the Truth of the Wanbaoshan Case When Passing Through Tianjin</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Zhang Zuoxiang, who is sitting in Shenyang on behalf of Zhang Xueliang, believes that after the Wanbaoshan Incident in Changchun, the Japanese side increased the number of police teams to assist the Koreans, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious, and negotiations may expand. It is necessary to present the truth to Zhang Xueliang and negotiate the response policy. Therefore, he left Shenyang on the 6th to enter the customs. He arrived in Beiping at 10 am on the 7th. After getting off the train, he went to the Beijing Hotel to rest. However, because he had just unloaded his luggage and was busy with official duties, he did not receive any visitors. That night, he went to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital to visit Zhang Xueliang. After meeting each other, Zhang Xueliang was very pleased and said that he had something to discuss and that his arrival was excellent. The funeral of the Grand Marshal was originally scheduled for October, but because I have not yet recovered and everything is not ready, it may be too late to hold the funeral in October. It is proposed to postpone it to December.</p>
<p>During the period, I should ask you to preside over the postponement. I have just recovered from a serious illness and need time to recuperate. I will not be able to return to Shenyang in the shortest time. If there are no important official matters in Jilin, please stay in Shenyang to sit in town. After listening to the words, Zhang Zuoxiang agreed one by one and then chatted for a few words before resigning. Because the doctor forbade him to talk too much, the Wanbaoshan Incident was not reported in person. According to Rong Mengmei, the secretary of Zhang, the biggest purpose of Chairman Zhang's entry into the customs this time was only to visit the vice commander's illness. The day before yesterday, he went to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and saw that the vice commander was in good spirits. The talking time was only three minutes according to the doctor's instructions. The vice commander first thanked Chairman Zhang for his long-distance presence. The Wanbaoshan Incident was not as serious as the foreign propaganda. As of the time when the chairman and I entered the customs, the Japanese in Changchun County had shot at domestic farmers to demonstrate, but there were no casualties or expansion. Chairman Zhang did not report this matter when he saw the vice commander. At noon on the 8th, Mr. Zhang went to Wan Fulin's private residence for lunch. Yu Xuezhong, Wang Shuhan, Wang Shuchang, Ji Yiqiao, Zhang Xueming, etc. were all present. During the banquet, they discussed the Wanbaoshan Incident and important issues of Northeast diplomacy, and roughly made considerable decisions. At about 1 pm, they went to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital again with Wan Fulin, Zhang Xueming, Ji Yiqiao, Wang Shuchang, etc. to report to Zhang Xueliang and bid farewell. At 4:40 pm, they went to the East Railway Station to take a special train back to Shenyang. All the entourage</p>

<p>And all the guards, more than a hundred people, guarded along the way. Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, Wang Shuchang, Ji Yiqiao, Zhang Xueming, etc. all went to the station to see them off. Yu Xuezhong and others originally scheduled a public banquet for Mr. Zhang on the evening of the 8th. Mr. Zhang had no time to attend the banquet and hurriedly returned east. Its significance can be imagined.</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: On the afternoon of the 8th, Zhang Zuoxiang returned to Liaoning from Ping. At 8 o'clock, the train arrived at Tianjin East Station. Those who welcomed him at the station included Wang Yuke, He Yufang, Yao Hong, Zou Shangyou, Deng Qinglan, and Wang Yimin, the director of the Public Security Bureau. After the car stopped, Mr. Zhang got out of the car and briefly greeted the welcomers. The reporter asked for an interview and inquired about the truth of the Wanbaoshan Incident and the response policy. Mr. Zhang said that the truth of the matter was not as serious as the newspaper propaganda. Its origin was because a Chinese man, Hao Yongde, colluded with Li Zhaohe and others who had registered as Koreans in Changchun County to rent 500 mu of land and diverted water from the Yitong River to dig waterways to grow rice fields. The excavated waterway was 25 miles long, passing through nine villages, one zhang deep and about three or four zhang wide, occupying a lot of land from the county people. Therefore, the county people resolutely opposed this matter. However, the Koreans still ignored it, and the Japanese consul in Changchun Tian Dynasty increased the number of Japanese police to protect the Korean Qiaos in their excavation work. For a time, it aroused resentment among the people, and the Chinese police also stepped forward to protect our people. On the 20th of last month, when the Koreans were working on excavating the waterway, the Chinese gathered a crowd and filled the ditch with soil, filling it for about several miles. For a time, the atmosphere was tense. The Koreans clashed with our people, and the Japanese police also helped the Koreans open fire. Our people and the police team retreated into the ditch and fired back. However, neither side was injured. At that time, I was in Shenyang, and the Changchun County Government had not reported this matter. The Deputy Commander had telegraphed to inquire about the truth of the incident. It was the anniversary of the Grand Marshal's death. The next day, I asked Mr. Lin, the Japanese Consul General in Shenyang, to meet. Lin sent the Deputy Consul to meet with me, and each sent one person to Wanbaoshan to personally investigate the incident. After the investigation, they began to negotiate a peaceful solution. Our side withdrew the police team, and the Japanese side also withdrew the police. The Korean excavation work was temporarily suspended, and the excavation incident was handed over to the local authorities for legal resolution. Consul General Lin expressed his approval of this, and both sides ordered the withdrawal of the police. After our police team withdrew, the Japanese police also withdrew, but the Japanese used cunning means to replace them with twelve plainclothes policemen, each carrying a pistol to protect the Korean work. On the 2nd of this month, the two sides clashed again. I met with Consul General Lin and blamed him for the dishonesty of the diplomats. After our police withdrew, why did they replace them with plainclothes police? He said that he had recently received an order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the unfortunate incidents between China and Japan in the Northeast in recent years, such as the Liaoning Bridge Incident and the Wanbaoshan Incident, were enough to affect international sentiment and expressed deep regret for this matter. He also regretted the expulsion of Koreans from the Northeast. I said that I have always advocated peace and should be known to everyone. There is no such thing as expelling Koreans. The Wanbaoshan Incident is not an expulsion of Koreans. Otherwise, there are 600,000 Koreans in Jilin Province, both registered and unregistered, why are they all able to live in peace, and only 100 or 200 Koreans in Wanbaoshan are not tolerated by the people? Rice fields are not impossible to grow there, but they must be approved by the Chinese government and cannot forcibly occupy private land. Think about it, if the Chinese diverted water to grow rice in your country and forcibly occupied private land to dig waterways, what would your country think? Even if the mixed residence in the interior that your country advocates is achieved, you must abide by Chinese laws. The Wanbaoshan Incident has been investigated by both sides, and it is not difficult to distinguish who is right and who is wrong. Lin was speechless at this point. In short, the Korean's method of growing rice in Wanbaoshan was not approved by the county government, and the forced occupation of land to dig ditches was not in compliance with the procedures. The intense anti-Chinese sentiment caused by this incident is a big fuss over a trivial matter. All these circumstances have been reported to the Northeast Political Committee and submitted to the National Government for the record. As for the policy to deal with this matter in the future, the local authorities will still resolve it peacefully. Secondly, he said that Deputy Commander Zhang has recovered greatly and is in good spirits, but he is slightly thinner than before. He will be discharged from the hospital soon. My trip will return to Shenyang, with a slight delay, or I may have to return to Jilin. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Wanbaoshan Negotiation Case <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Consul in Jilin-Changchun Repeatedly Makes Unreasonable Demands</p>
<p>Talking About the Recent Situation in Wanbaoshan Town</p>
<p>Victimized Chinese Farmers Issue a Proclamation of Proper Defense</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: After the Wanbaoshan Incident, the Japanese Consul in Jilin, Ishisha, based on the report of the Japanese Consul in Changchun, Tian Dynasty, went to our Diplomatic Office several times on the 3rd and 4th to meet with Director Shi Luben and demanded that our side send troops to quickly disperse the Chinese farmers who filled the ditch and disarm the self-defense firearms, so that the Koreans could continue their work. Director Shi replied that this time, the villagers of our country gathered to fill the trench, which was actually caused by the oppression of the Japanese side, and they were outraged by righteousness. The gathered victims, holding guns for self-defense, filling the ditch and leveling the embankment, could not be stopped. If the Koreans stopped working and the Japanese police withdrew, there would be a considerable solution. They dispersed without results. After returning to the office, Ishisha submitted a written protest to the Foreign Affairs Office at 10 am on the 5th. The language was extremely absurd. Just in time, the Civil Affairs Director of Kwantung, Tsukamoto, brought his secretary, Tomida Tokio, and nine others to Jilin to inspect the Jidun and other roads. For this case, he personally went to the Provincial Government and asked the acting chairman, Xi Qia, to find a way to stop the Wanbaoshan people from filling the trenches in order to prevent the occurrence of a second unfortunate incident. The Japanese Consul in Changchun, Tian Dynasty, also went to our Municipal Government three times on the 4th and 5th and asked Guo, the director of the Diplomatic Section, to order the Changchun County Government to arrest the leaders of the trench-filling people and bring them to justice. Guo replied that the Japanese police fired first this time, injuring more than a dozen of our Chinese people. The responsibility must be borne by the Japanese side. Please withdraw and punish the Japanese police who started the incident in order to appease the anger of our people. As for how to resolve it, we will wait for the Director of the Office to return to Chang from Jin before handling it. At 10 am on the 6th, the Japanese Consul went to the Foreign Affairs Office again and demanded that the people who caused the incident be punished. Guo Wan refused again and asked to withdraw all the Japanese police and troops first before negotiations could begin, otherwise there would be no way to stop it. The Japanese Consul left in anger.</p>
<p>The reporter recently went to the vicinity of Wanbaoshan to investigate and risked going to Majia Outpost, the scene of the incident fifty miles away from Changchun, to take pictures and met with Nakagawa, a Japanese police officer, and obtained the following results: The number of armed Japanese police has increased to seventy-three. Some set up tents to sleep in the open, and some invaded the residences of Wang He and Ma San surnames in Majia Outpost, using the dug-out ditches to build a two-mile-long trench, setting up machine guns and cannons towards the villages. Bombs and landmines were buried on both sides of the ditch, and carrier pigeons were used to communicate with the consulate barracks. In addition, dozens of police uniforms were used to order the Koreans to wear them to demonstrate to the villagers. At night, they patrolled for several miles. Under the protection of the Japanese police, the Koreans cut down the willow branches of the houses and filled sacks with soil to build dams in the river, which were more than a zhang high. However, the water was still far from entering the ditch. The water level upstream was getting deeper day by day. At Jiangqiao, twenty miles away from Majia Outpost, it was originally possible to wade across. On the 6th, the reporter rode a horse across, almost being submerged. Traffic on both banks has been cut off. The ferry at Majia Outpost has been occupied by the Japanese, and traffic there has also been cut off. Most of the villagers in the nearby villages have moved away. Those who have not escaped keep their doors closed during the day and do not go out. However, Nakagawa Yoshizhao, a Japanese police officer, told the reporter that there were no deaths or injuries in the incident on the morning of the 2nd, because both sides fired shots into the air. I was ordered by the consul to bring forty-seven police officers here to protect the Koreans. I only know my responsibilities and nothing else. The withdrawal of the police also requires orders. I sincerely hope to resolve it as soon as possible so that I can return to Changchun soon. According to Qu Xianglou, a representative of the farmers, the land in Wanbaoshan is all good farmland, and there is no fear of drought or flood. Now it has been destroyed by digging, causing hundreds of households to become impoverished. Therefore, everyone is of one heart and must persevere to the end. The farmers in the Wanbaoshan area are in a state of agitation, and dozens of villages have jointly organized a diplomatic support group. Their slogans read: "Our land, which is related to everyone's life and property, has been dug into trenches by illegal people and divided into two sections, harming everyone's work. We have repeatedly presented it to the government, but there is no solution. We have no choice but to decide for ourselves and implement proper self-defense measures. On the one hand, we will restore the original state for cultivation, and on the other hand, we will ask the government to order the illegal people to compensate for the losses. This is a public announcement." The public announcement of the victims of the Wanbaoshan farmland has four directors and thirty members of the support group, representing dozens of villages, and each has self-defense guns and farm tools as weapons, vowing to fight for land rights. When the police were sent to suppress and persuade, they were warned not to clash. However, if the Japanese dig the ditch again, a fierce battle may be unavoidable. (July 6)</p>

<p>All Overseas Chinese in Korea Have No Way to Escape</p>
<p>Beijing News: The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Incheon, Korea, urgently telegraphed to Beijing for assistance, saying that Koreans have launched a large-scale harm to Overseas Chinese since the 3rd, using the Wanbaoshan case as an excuse. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: "To President Jiang of Nanjing, Vice President Zhang, the Central Party Headquarters, various departments of the Executive Yuan, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and forwarded to various agencies and newspapers: Korean newspapers have been advocating the Wanbaoshan Incident, inciting Koreans to riot in Wai-ri at 2 am on the Jiang-ri. The Consulate General's Incheon Office has asked the local police station to strictly stop it and be responsible for protection. In the afternoon, the situation became urgent. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and the director of the office went to the police station again to ask them to prohibit newspaper instigation and take strict precautions, and telegraphed to the Consul General to order the Governor-General's Office to strictly suppress it to avoid repeating the tragedy of 1927. Unexpectedly, the newspaper still issued extra editions, intensely propagating, and the Koreans also distributed leaflets and held meetings everywhere. At 8 pm, two or three thousand Koreans gathered and launched a large-scale riot. The police's attempt to stop it was ineffective, and chaos broke out everywhere. When they encountered our Overseas Chinese, they immediately attacked them randomly. The Overseas Chinese either closed their doors to defend themselves or fled in all directions. All the Overseas Chinese shops and vegetable gardens outside Chinatown were mostly destroyed by rioters. Many Chinese were beaten and injured. The next day, the news got worse. The Overseas Chinese flocked to Chinatown to evacuate. The director of the office and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, seeing that the riot was expanding and the lives and property of the Overseas Chinese were in extreme danger, went to the police station to ask the police to send armed forces to strictly suppress it, and telegraphed to the Consul General to request the Governor-General's Office to send additional military police to assist. The director of the office stated that he would assume full responsibility for the lives and property of our Overseas Chinese. The Governor-General's Office also agreed to send an additional 50 armed police. At 2 pm, the Consul General came to Incheon and went to the police station again to urge them to earnestly be responsible for protection. The director of the office replied as before. At 8 pm, more and more Koreans gathered, and the riot became more intense. The police had lost the power to protect. When asked by the police station, they said that there were not enough police to distribute. The Overseas Chinese were helpless and waited to die. The rioters, except for failing to attack Chinatown, wreaked havoc everywhere else. The situation was too horrible to bear. All the doors and windows of the Overseas Chinese shops were smashed, and the goods and appliances were destroyed and looted. All the vegetable gardens were also destroyed. Three Overseas Chinese were confirmed to have been brutally killed, and the lives of several others were at risk. About twenty or thirty people were injured but not fatally. The Overseas Chinese in various places who failed to escape were all escorted to Chinatown by the police in cars. It is estimated that the Chamber of Commerce has taken in more than 2,000 male and female refugees, and all the shops are full. At that time, the clamor of Koreans planning to break into Chinatown was extremely high. The Overseas Chinese had no way to escape, trembling with fear and in extreme danger. Please urgently ask the Consul General to make every effort to negotiate with the Governor-General's Office and ask them to send additional military police to rescue them. Another 50 armed police and 20 military police were sent. The Incheon police also carried weapons. The area of Chinatown is small, and the strength of the military police has been increased again. Although the rioters still gathered that night, they finally did not dare to break in. The Overseas Chinese were spared from disaster. However, two vegetable gardens were burned by them. It is difficult to predict whether this place will gradually calm down in the future and whether it will not spread to other places. It has been found that there are no less than several million Koreans living in our three northeastern provinces. There are good and bad people mixed in. It is inevitable that incidents will occur. The two governments will resolve it. If the people retaliate against each other, there will be no end. Since 1927, the Koreans have launched a large-scale riot under the pretext of our country's oppression of Korean Qiaos. It has only been more than three years since then, and the unresolved case has been repeated, and the tragedy has been several times more violent than before. The police station has repeatedly promised to provide full protection, but they are unwilling to take precautions in advance, and they have no sufficient power to stop it temporarily. They will only increase their efforts to strictly prevent it after the Overseas Chinese have been brutally poisoned by rioters. It is difficult to understand what the situation is. In this situation, if our Overseas Chinese in Korea do not have considerable guarantees, there is really no place for them to stand. The only way is to withdraw from Korea altogether. Please quickly find a way to protect them. The Incheon Chinese Chamber of Commerce bows."</p>
<p>Attached Report: It has been reported by telephone and extra edition from Zhennampo that all the Chinese merchants in Pyongyang have been wiped out, the houses have been burned, more than 30 people have died, and countless people have been injured. It has also been heard that the rioters have news of attacking Incheon Chinatown, and the situation is extremely critical. Please rescue them quickly.</p>

<p>Passed the Organizational Charter of the International Trade Bureau</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan held its 150th meeting this morning (the 11th) at 8:00 AM. The attending committee members included Luo Ding, Shi Shangkuan, Zhang Zhihan, Lu Zhonglin, Liu Kejun, Zhu Luhe, Li Shuhua, Zhu Hezhong, Xi Chaojun, Liu Jingxin, Peng Yangguang, Tao Xuan, Lü Zhiyi, Lin Bin, Shi Weihuan, Fang Juehui, Wei Huai, Liu Shishun, Feng Zhaoyi, Enke Batu, Huang Youchang, Zhou Wei, Ma Yinchu, Lou Tongsun, Wang Yongbin, Liu Jixue, Zhu Jingsong, and others, totaling twenty-seven members. The meeting was chaired by Acting President Shao Yuanchong. Items for discussion included: (1) Examining the Organizational Charter of the Central Mint. Resolution: Referred to the Legislative Committee for review. (2) Examining the Organizational Charter of the Hangzhou Mint. Resolution: Referred to the Legislative Committee for review. (3) The Legislative Committee, in conjunction with the Economic Committee, reported on the examination of the Organizational Charter of the International Trade Bureau. Resolution: Amended and passed. (4) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Yuan reported on the examination and approval of the agreement on the treatment of Chinese nationals going to Nicaragua and its annexes. Resolution: Referred back to the Foreign Affairs Committee for re-examination.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Legislative Yuan Resolves to Re-examine the Sino-Nicaraguan Agreement <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Previously, due to Nicaragua's promulgation of immigration laws with harsh treatment of overseas Chinese, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially dispatched Consul General Li Shizhong to negotiate with the Nicaraguan government for cancellation. Consequently, a draft agreement on the treatment of Chinese nationals going to Nicaragua was negotiated by both parties. In the annex to the draft, the Nicaraguan side declared: (1) The fifth clause of the Immigration Law of May 5, 1930, concerning the prevention of Chinese entry, will be abolished. Once passed by the Nicaraguan Congress, the agreement signed today will take effect before the exchange of ratifications. (2) The future formal treaty of commerce and navigation between China and Nicaragua will not be bound by this agreement. The content of the agreement involves our side voluntarily restricting the number of Chinese entering Nicaragua, with twelve articles stipulated. The first article stipulates that Chinese nationals enjoy the same treatment as nationals of other countries. Based on this article, all unequal and harsh treatments can be canceled. Articles two, three, and four indicate the method of voluntary restriction, limiting the number of overseas Chinese going to Nicaragua to fifteen per year. However, wives and minor children can enter freely. Articles six and seven concern the procedures for overseas Chinese traveling in transit. Article eight allows for the replenishment of vacancies when overseas Chinese die or return to their country. After the above agreement was submitted to the Yuan by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and thoroughly studied by the Central Political Council, the Central Political Council added the tenth article: "When Nicaraguan people come to China, they should be handled in accordance with the above articles of this agreement." It was then submitted by the Central Political Council to the National Government and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. At the 147th plenary session of the Yuan, it was resolved to refer it to the Foreign Affairs Committee for review. After the committee met and reviewed it, they considered it approvable and submitted it to the 150th plenary session on the 11th. After Lou Tongsun of the Foreign Affairs Committee reported on the review process, it was submitted to the committees for discussion. The second reading then began. After the second reading, Committee Member Lü Zhiyi stood up and opposed the approval of the agreement, stating that the content of the agreement was absolutely unequal. Nicaragua is a small country, and our country is accommodating this unequal treaty for the benefit of only fifteen people per year. This violates the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and sets a precedent for other countries to follow, making it even more difficult for Chinese to go abroad. Fang Juehui continued to speak, believing that the agreement should not be passed. Restrictions such as good conduct, sound health, and economic independence in Article Two mean that the Nicaraguan side can restrict the entry of Chinese people at any time, and this article reveals more of our own shortcomings. Furthermore, foreigners coming to China have no restrictions, arriving in groups of thousands, and there is no greater inequality than this. Lou Tongsun explained that although the number of Chinese going to Nicaragua is limited to fifteen, Article Five</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>does not include family members (wives and minor children) entering the country, and the number of people who can be replenished in Article Eight is not small. If it is believed that not approving the agreement means preparing not to send anyone, that is fine. However, the 600 overseas Chinese currently in Nicaragua should also be taken into consideration. Furthermore, the Central Political Council has already added Article Ten, stipulating that Nicaraguans coming to China should abide by the agreement. Lü Zhiyi stood up again and stated that the provisions of Article Ten should have been explained under Articles Two and Three instead of being listed separately. We would rather suffer losses than have this unequal agreement. Shi Weihuan stated that Nicaragua is not the only country currently restricting Chinese immigration. The United States, Mexico, and others are also doing so. If countries follow suit and restrict Chinese immigration, then Chinese people will have no way out. The regulations on economic independence, etc., are even more inappropriate, because Chinese farmers and businessmen who are independent do not need to go abroad to do hard labor. Luo Ding said that although this agreement only concerns China and Nicaragua, it has a significant impact on the future of Chinese people going abroad. Nicaragua's harsh immigration laws can be ignored or protested through diplomatic channels for cancellation, without the need to conclude an unequal agreement to bind ourselves. He advocated not passing it. At this point, President Shao said that the meaning of the first article of the agreement is good, treating people equally, but the second and third articles restrict the number of people, which contradicts itself. Although the tenth article stipulates that Nicaraguans entering China should abide by the articles of this agreement, the ninth article states that this agreement should not prejudice the application of laws and regulations applicable to foreigners in general in Nicaragua, which is also contradictory. The atmosphere in the room was quite tense as the discussion reached this point. Zhou Wei, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee (and also a member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), stood up and advocated for a closed-door meeting, prohibiting audience members. Before the committee members could pay attention, Zhang Zhihan spoke, stating that this agreement was specifically designed to restrict Chinese people, and it would be difficult to deal with if other countries followed suit. Furthermore, the rights of fifteen people are not important to the 400 million people in the country. The criticism of our people in Article Three means that anyone can be difficult, and it should not be passed. Zhou Wei stood up for the second time, requesting a closed-door meeting. Ma Yinchu opposed it, believing that national politics should be open in principle and can be open. Lü Zhiyi stood up again and stated that if this agreement is passed and ratified, it will become a final decision and cannot be reversed or amended, and there will be no way to improve harsh treatments. Zhou Wei said that the annex states that the harsh immigration laws can be canceled after being passed by the Nicaraguan Congress, and we should take advantage of this point. Wang Yongbin said that in that case, we can refer it for re-examination. If they pass it first and abolish the immigration laws, it may not be a problem whether our side passes it or not. Zhang Zhihan spoke, disapproving of this method. This case does not need to be shelved, and the agreement should be rejected. Since we do not want fifteen people to go to Nicaragua, why should we wait for them to indirectly cancel the immigration laws? Liu Shishun spoke, asking to pay attention to the relief measures for the 600 overseas Chinese currently in Nicaragua. Shao Yuanchong spoke, stating that the agreement has many shortcomings and has been discussed for a long time. There are two main opinions: one is to amend it, and the other is to reject it. The method of amendment is that it can be referred for re-examination. If they pass it first and abolish the immigration laws, the Central Political Council will report, present the opinions of the committee members, and the Central Political Council will order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to earnestly negotiate amendments with the Nicaraguan side. When the amendments are sent, they will be submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee together. The committee members had no objection to Shao's proposal and resolved to refer the Sino-Nicaraguan agreement back to the Foreign Affairs Committee for re-examination.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Recent Banditry and Mutiny in Shanxi Province <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Bandit Troubles Reported Repeatedly Near the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>Another Mutiny by Garrison Troops in Pingding</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Xuan Army has been undergoing roll call verifications by representatives of the Deputy Commander's Office for days, and it is expected to be completed soon. Fu Zhan Kui, accompanied by Hu Jiesan, Director of Sun Dianying's Office in Pingding, arrived in Bing yesterday. It is said that Fu's visit is on behalf of Zhang Xueliang to comfort the generals and report on Zhang Xueliang's illness, as well as to inspect the roll call verifications and salary distribution of various units. He plans to stay here for two or three days before going to Jincheng and Yuncheng to comfort Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, and others. In addition, the roll call verification representatives previously dispatched by the Deputy Commander's Office, except for Li Linshu, Ma Junwu, and Wang Zhizhong, who remain in Bing, are still conducting roll call verifications in various counties. Amidst these roll call verifications, an extremely unfavorable phenomenon has been discovered: conscription is rampant everywhere. Previously, this bad phenomenon only existed in southern Shanxi, but recently it has also appeared in Yucheng, Qixian, and other places near the provincial capital. As for bandit troubles, they have become increasingly serious lately. In Yongji, Zhongyang, Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Xixian, and various places along the Jinnan Railway, bandit cases have occurred repeatedly. The ransoms demanded range from three to two thousand yuan to as much as three to five million yuan. As a result, society is extremely uneasy. The people in Zhongyang have abandoned their homes and sought refuge in deep mountains and valleys due to the disturbances caused by bandits. Communist Party leaflets and declarations have also been repeatedly discovered in the provincial capital recently. If the Shanxi authorities do not take precautions against these multi-disaster-stricken situations, the bleak future will be unbearable. Regarding the mutiny of the garrison troops, news from Pingding stated that two battalions of a certain regiment stationed in the county town suddenly mutinied at 8:00 PM on the 4th after a heavy rain. At about 10:00 PM, they surrounded the county government and opened the prison. When surrounding the county government, the company commander of the fifth company of the regiment was killed by the mutineers for allegedly informing the county police chief of the situation. A platoon leader and a soldier were also killed. The mutiny was subsequently suppressed by the remaining troops, and fortunately, it did not affect the market. The mutineers left Qingfengkou in the southeast of Mengxian and headed towards Pingxing, which belongs to Hebei. The area is currently under strict guard. (July 7)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Quick Dispatch from Wuhu <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The 9th was the 5th anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition Pledge Rally. All sectors held a commemorative meeting at the county party headquarters, with hundreds of people attending. Party Secretary Zhang Shuye chaired the meeting and gave a speech commemorating the pledge, stressing the need to ensure peaceful unification. All industries took a day off, hung flags, and celebrated.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hankou airplanes used to have a stop in Wuhu for passenger and mail transport, which was convenient for merchants and travelers. However, recently, due to the opening of the Wanxian station, the airplanes no longer stop in Wuhu for the convenience of navigation. The Wuhu station office was officially closed yesterday.</p>
<p>The Taiping Fellow Association here recently received a telegram from Taiping County stating that the bandit situation near Taiping is huge. The bandit force is the entire force of Li Xiu, and there is a plan to attack Gantang. The county town has telegraphed the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs nearby, requesting them to send troops to assist and order the neighboring counties of Qingyang and Shitai to block them.</p>
<p>The county party headquarters resolved to send a telegram to the central government requesting the cessation of the French investigation team's advancement and the recall of the team leader, Chu Minyi, to avoid insulting national sovereignty.</p>
<p>Since the past ten days, Wuhu has been experiencing incessant rain, and low-lying areas have become swamps. Areas like Fenglin and other villages in the four districts were breached by water, and other areas such as Baisha, Zhenghe, and the villages along the river are also in extreme danger. Stakes and wood are being used day and night to rescue them, and new dikes and embankments of Xintang Lake are being dug and destroyed to drain the water.</p>
<p>Representatives from all sectors held a meeting at the county chamber of commerce, stating that too many telephone lines are damaged and urgently need to be replaced. However, the telephone bureau does not have these funds. It was resolved that telephone users will borrow and advance 4,800 yuan to be used to replace the lines, which will be deducted from monthly bills. A report will be jointly submitted to the Ministry of Communications by the public security bureau, county government, and county chamber of commerce for record. (9th)</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee issued a telegram the day before yesterday requesting the central government to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously protest against the Wanpaoshan incident. The original text is as follows: Nanjing Central Executive Committee: It has been found that the southward and eastward invasion policies of Japanese imperialism have been rejected by Britain and the United States, so they are focusing on northward expansion to realize their so-called continental policy. For more than ten years, they have repeatedly disturbed our northeast border and repeatedly committed atrocities, which can be seen as clear evidence of their desperate attempts to use force to invade our three eastern provinces and Mongolia and realize their continental policy. Recently, in the Wanpaoshan incident, Japanese police shot and killed our compatriots, and Japanese imperialists instigated Koreans in Pyongyang, Incheon, and other places in the Korean border to carry out riots against our overseas Chinese. The loss of life and property of our compatriots in Korea is beyond description. The tragic scene of people running for their lives and seeking to avoid death cannot be fully described in words. To this day, they have not stopped their atrocities. The Japanese imperialists' atrocities are the initial step in implementing their policy of military invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia. The seriousness of the nature is even greater than the Jinan Massacre. If we do not negotiate seriously, the consequences are unimaginable. We hereby telegraphically request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest as soon as possible, with the aim of achieving compensation, punishing the murderers, apologizing, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur again in the future, and actively preventing their policy of aggression, in order to uphold justice and protect public rights. The urgency of the telegram is overwhelming. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang kowtows with dust.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Three Robbery Cases Reported in One Day <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Recently, robbery cases have been on the rise in both urban and rural areas. Although detectives have been dispatched to investigate separately, few cases have been solved. Yesterday alone, three robbery cases were reported, which is a hidden concern for the future of public safety. The details are as follows: (1) In Xiyangqiao, an area bordering Wuxi City, a boat has been traveling daily between urban and rural areas. The day before yesterday, it was traveling from Xiyangqiao to Wuxi. When the boat passed the Hu Hui Bridge River at 10:00 PM, a pirate ship suddenly appeared from the Kan Zhuang Dangwai River. There were sixteen or seventeen pirates, each armed with long guns and short knives, who swarmed onto the boat and searched it at will. None of the dozen or so passengers were spared. After about an hour, they took the stolen goods and left. Upon checking afterwards, it was found that the Tianyixiang consignment had been robbed of 300 yuan, the boat owner and crew had lost 300 yuan, and the passengers had lost more than 100 yuan. In addition, dozens of pieces of ocean and general goods, mosquito nets, quilts, and clothing were stolen, as well as 1.5 taels of gold jewelry, totaling about 1,000 yuan. (2) At the home of villager Shen Peizhi in Lujianxia, at the foot of Longwang Mountain in the 12th District (Kaihua Township) of the county, more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived at 12:00 PM the night before last, climbed over the high walls, and searched for about half an hour before leaving, resulting in a loss of about 200 yuan. The wife of Shen Peizhi's eldest son, Xiqing, was severely beaten. (3) In the Zhumiao village near Jingyun Zhoujing Port, Jin Zhuting's grocery store, which also served as a postal agency, was approached by several bandits at about 10:00 PM the night before last, who knocked on the door under the pretext of shopping. Jin Cai knew something was wrong and refused to open the door. The bandits then fired guns to intimidate him. Jin quickly rang the alarm, alarming the military police stationed at the parking station, who went to pursue them. The bandits then fled.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Fixed Amount of Business Tax Determined for Rice Industry <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the rice industry had repeatedly petitioned the ministries and provinces, and united with all counties in the province to advocate that rice is a daily necessity for the people and that dental tile tax and donations had already been paid, so business tax should not be levied again. Subsequently, an order was received from the ministries and provinces stating that dental tile tax and donations are limited to the sale of bulk goods on behalf of customers, and that the sale of rice in stores is still subject to taxation according to tax rates. The Business Tax Bureau and the County Chamber of Commerce repeatedly negotiated with the standing committee members of the industry, and through great persuasion, the entire industry agreed to pay an annual business tax of 4,000 yuan, and limited the first quarterly tax of 1,000 yuan to be paid within the day as a final decision.</p>

<p>The patrol chief of the First Precinct directly under the Public Security Bureau, Zhu Guisheng, led police officers the day before yesterday to catch gamblers at Liu A San's house across the river from Huai Gu Bridge outside the East Gate. They arrested gamblers Sun Zhulin and others. The fisherman Zhang Koubaozi happened to be fishing there and, mistaking them for conscriptors, jumped into the river, resulting in drowning. His body was not found until the next morning near Dongshuiguan. It was carried ashore and reported for investigation. At 8:00 AM yesterday, Prosecutor Zhu went to conduct a legal investigation. The investigation revealed that the deceased, Zhang Koubaozi, had indeed drowned in the river. After the investigation, the family members were ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. The gamblers Sun Zhulin and others who were arrested were transferred to the Public Security Bureau by Inspector Yu Shuming of the First Precinct, and then transferred to the County Court. After Prosecutor Du opened the court for interrogation, he ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>A boatman named Qian Zuogen on a Wuyi Caoqiao boat lost his footing and fell into the river while poling the boat outside the East Gate Shuimen Bridge on the afternoon of the 9th. Due to the heavy rain in recent days, the river was turbulent, and he disappeared after falling into the water. After the people on the boat and bystanders searched for two hours, his body was finally recovered. The police station in charge of the area reported the incident to the County Court Procuratorate, which dispatched personnel to investigate on the 10th and ordered the preparation of a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>The court reopened the trial of Xie Shaoqing's rape case yesterday. The girl, Chen Ruiying, suddenly overturned her previous confession and denied that Xie had raped her. She also claimed that she was still a virgin. The court then sent the police to take her to Hongren Hospital for diagnosis.

<p>A woman named Lou, from the Chen family at No. 14 Beihexia, had been married for ten years and had not conceived. Whenever she heard that a neighbor had given birth to a boy, she would be so angry that she would try to kill herself, hanging herself or swallowing smoke, not just once. Yesterday (the 9th), upon hearing that a neighbor had given birth to a boy, she couldn't stop sighing. Her in-laws comforted and watched over her. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM, the woman suddenly took advantage of a gap and ran out of the entrance and drowned herself in the river. Fortunately, a water carrier noticed it and told the owner of the nearby beef shop to rescue her. As soon as she was rescued, she was unconscious. After being given ginger soup, she woke up. Chen and the landlord plan to go to Qiaoshu and talk to Lou's family to avoid future liability for loss of life.</p>

<p>The bandit Xie Ma Wu'er from Lu Port, using the alias Zhang Mingfeng, had been hiding in the city. He was previously recruited as a porter and sent to Zhenjiang. Yesterday, he secretly returned to the city of Rugao. At Yanqiao Kou in the West Gate, he was spotted by Song Qingbai, a victim of his crimes, who recognized him. Song Qingbai reported this to the First Precinct. Patrol Officer Qiu led police to arrest Xie Wu'er. They found a return-to-origin road pass from the transport team and various symbols on his person. He was immediately sent to the bureau for preliminary interrogation by Section Chief Xu. However, the bandit gave a cunning and evasive confession, refusing to tell the truth. Later, Song Xingbai identified him, stating that Zhang Mingfeng was indeed Xie Ma Wu'er, also known as Xie Linyou. He recounted the burning and killing in Xiejiadian, Lu Port, in July, and the kidnapping of Song's wife for ransom, with Xie and Zhu Xiangzhi as the ringleaders. Many people in Xiejiadian still recognize him. Furthermore, the bandits previously captured by the Second Squad all confessed that Xie was involved in the burning, killing, and kidnapping. Song had been serving in the Second Squad at the time, so he knew the details very well, and there were records to prove it. Based on this testimony, Section Chief Xu ordered the bandit to be handed over to the county government for legal proceedings, as he had now been identified by the victim.</p>

<p>The Linpu area is jointly administered by Shaoshan and Xiaoshan. After the establishment of autonomous regions, it became the Seventh District for Shaoshan and the Fourth District for Xiaoshan. Previously, police affairs in the area were handled by the Shaoshan-Xiaoshan Linpu Public Security Bureau. This time, due to the delineation of county boundaries and the reorganization of police districts, Xiaoshan established the Fourth Public Security Bureau, and Shaoshan established the Seventh Public Security Bureau. However, County Magistrate Du of Xiaoshan insisted on incorporating the entire town of Linpu into Xiaoshan County. Despite opposition from Shaoshan, he has not given up. He has now appointed Du Weiguo as the director of the Fourth Public Security Bureau of Xiaoshan County and ordered him to take over the Shaoshan-Xiaoshan Linpu Public Security Bureau. Bureau Chief Zhou Rujie, believing that the bureau was jointly administered by both counties and should not be transferred entirely, came to Shaoxing yesterday to request instructions. Public Security Bureau Chief Mo stated that Linpu, under the jurisdiction of Shaoshan, could not be incorporated into Xiaoshan. He had previously listed the reasons and submitted them to the provincial and county governments. Now that Xiaoshan County has sent officials to take over the entire town, causing public resentment, a fair decision should be made. He has submitted a request to County Magistrate Zheng for review and action. Meanwhile, Tang Zhonglin and over fifty other representatives of the Seventh District of Shaoxing have submitted a petition to the Shaoxing County Party Department, requesting that it be forwarded to the Provincial Executive Committee and then to the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, urging them to revoke the aforementioned appointment and order Shaoxing County to establish the Seventh Public Security Bureau of Shaoxing as soon as possible, dividing the administrative power to avoid disputes.</p>

According to investigations, in February of this year, a mutiny occurred among the troops stationed in Lu'an, resulting in the deaths of many brigade and regimental commanders. Zu's unit was also among those who mutinied. When Chen Tiaoyuan went to Lu'an to inspect defenses, he appropriately punished certain military officers involved in the case. Zu submitted a letter of repentance, requesting to continue serving. Chen, finding it inconvenient to punish him in Lu'an, appointed him as an adjutant and ordered him to come to the province. He secretly telegraphed Fan, stating that Zu had allowed his troops to harm the people and that, upon verification, he should be executed. Fan placed Zu under guard upon his arrival in the province and executed him according to the telegram.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Ministry of Education Temporarily Dissolves Labor University Yesterday <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Orders all University and Middle School Students to Leave School</p>
<p>丨University Students to Register on a Fixed Date丨Middle School to Close</p>
<p>According to a report regarding the Labor University, since taking office, Wang Jingqi, the president of the National Labor University, has been working tirelessly to rectify the situation and gradually implement a system of half-day work and half-day study for the students. However, deeply ingrained problems have proven difficult to overcome. Social criticism suggests that Labor University students "neither work nor study" and are "arrogant and dissolute." While this may apply to only a segment of the student body, unfortunately, this segment wields considerable influence within the university, acting as they please. Their fundamental thinking is flawed. As demonstrated during a graduation tea party, one student openly declared, "All faculty and staff in the university are public servants of us students. We must supervise and guide them." As a result, any attempt by the university authorities to implement even slight reforms "invariably provokes blame." Trouble arises constantly, over matters both big and small. In April, the middle school division experienced an incident involving the expulsion of Mr. Yang Sifu, the head of the division. Yang, a graduate of Hunan Normal School and the Belgian Labor University, is known for his integrity and dedication, but his strict discipline of students led to a student-led siege, forcing him to resign. The university authorities proceeded with caution, sending three senior staff members to investigate. The investigation resulted in the expulsion of four students. These students refused to leave the university and instigated unrest, leading to a strike at the end of May and the presentation of numerous demands, including the reinstatement of the expelled students. The Ministry of Education sent Section Chief Dai Yingguan to Shanghai to investigate alongside Xu, the director of the Shanghai Education Bureau. Their mission was to address the unrest in the middle school division. On July 2, Director Xu and Section Chief Dai personally visited the middle school division. The disorderly and dissolute state of the students in their dormitories and classrooms was appalling, confirming the rumors. They immediately gathered several students from each class, inquired about the strike, and offered advice, arranging to continue the discussion at the university division the next morning. The following day, Section Chief Dai, accompanied by Superintendent Li, representing Director Xu, arrived at the university division and were greeted by President Wang. Suddenly, graduating students gathered and demanded that President Wang provide funds for a sightseeing trip, far exceeding the amount designated by the Ministry of Education. When the president refused, they gathered students from both the university and middle school divisions, broke up President Wang and the two representatives, and forcibly confined President Wang and Ministry of Education Section Chief Dai in Classroom 6, barricading all entrances. From 10:30 AM to 3:30 PM, they made various unreasonable demands. Police rushed to the scene to provide assistance. The police chief initially entered the university and attempted to negotiate a peaceful release, but the students refused. Later, a full squad arrived and were able to resolve the situation. During the confinement, the behavior of the students from both the university and middle school divisions of the Labor University was unrestrained. Their behavior, words, and actions were such that even those who were not present could imagine the scene. It can be said to be a great stain on the Chinese academic world, and requires no further elaboration. The university authorities have always advocated for sincerity in influencing young people, treating students with care and love, as if they were their own children. The students' behavior is deeply distressing. Upon receiving the report, the Ministry of Education decided to implement a fundamental rectification, telegraphing the university to temporarily dissolve. The university's announcement is listed below:</p>
<p>Announcement Regarding the Temporary Dissolution of the University:</p>
<p>This university was founded four years ago with the intention of implementing the Three Principles of the People through labor education, providing educational opportunities for poor youth, and nurturing leaders in agriculture and industry who are diligent, trustworthy, sincere, and respectful. Since taking office this year, the president has dedicated his efforts to this end, personally advising the students. Unfortunately, there have been repeated incidents of unrest in recent months. Some students have repeatedly violated university regulations, showing disrespect to teachers, engaging in siege and coercion, and displaying contempt and humiliation, again and again. Reason cannot move them, and understanding cannot be achieved. This is deeply distressing. On the third of this month, the aforementioned behavior occurred again. If this is not rectified, what is the basis for establishing morality and learning? How can we fulfill the expectations of the Party and the nation in cultivating talent? Therefore, in accordance with the Ministry of Education's order, the Labor University and its affiliated middle school are temporarily dissolved. (1) Graduating students of the university division must leave the university immediately and may not linger. (2) All students of the university division must leave the university immediately and await the university's announcement of registration procedures, to be announced at a later date. (3) The middle school division is closed. All students of the middle school division must leave the university immediately and await a qualification examination, to be held at a later date. Those who pass will be given transfer certificates according to their level. All of the above must be strictly followed. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<h3 id="e103">New Initiatives at China Public School <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>China Public School in Wusong has a long history. Although there have been minor disturbances over the years, since the board of directors appointed Shao Lizi and Zhu Jingnong as president and vice president respectively last semester, they have been determined to make improvements, and the content has gradually changed. Donations have been raised to build a science hall, which will be completed in a few months. There are over 1,400 students. Zhu Jingnong recently accepted the position of president of Qilu University and could no longer oversee both positions, so he strongly resigned as vice president of China Public School. The board of directors was unable to retain him and instead appointed Pan Gongzhan as his successor to assist President Shao in handling school affairs. Vice President Pan has now agreed with President Shao to appoint the following faculty and staff for the twentieth year: Dean of Academic Affairs and Head of the Economics Department, Fan Zhongyun; Dean of Arts and Sciences and Head of the Literature Department, Xie Liuyi; Head of the Mathematics and Physics Department, Hu Yaomei; Dean of Law and Head of the Education and Sociology Department, Ying Chengyi; Head of the Political Science Department, Wu Songgao; Head of the Law Department, Dai Junliang; Dean of Commerce, Liu Nanhe; Head of the General Commerce Department, Zeng Bangxi; Head of the Banking and Accounting Department, Dai Lu; Head of the High School Department, Jiang Yingyong; Secretary-General and Head of General Affairs, Zhu Yingpeng; and Dean of Student Affairs, Tong Xingbai. It is reported that the course outlines for each department have been revised by the respective department heads, and each department will also appoint full-time professors to be responsible for guiding students in extracurricular research. The professors for each department are currently being sought. Special lectures will also be arranged, and renowned professors from other cities will be invited to give these lectures. According to Vice President Pan's statement to the reporter, his own affairs are very busy, and he initially intended to firmly decline the position, but he could not refuse due to the persuasion of various parties. He can only help to sort things out. In the future, the focus of running the school will be on increasing students' interest in academic research and extracurricular work. In terms of discipline and course content, strict attention will be paid to eliminating the old habits of laxity, so as not to fail the original intentions of the founders of China Public School.</p>

<p>Xiqing is the practice venue</p>
<p>The Chinese Swimming Research Association was established in 1929. It now has over 300 members, all of whom started as beginners. Last year, it was not easy to hire volunteer instructors, so Yu Binqi personally guided those enthusiastic about research, and no fewer than 40 people were successful. This time, in order to improve techniques, the association is participating in the Sino-American-Japanese swimming competition in Xiqing. The competition was originally organized by country. However, the Xiqing Swimming Pool is not large, and it was feared that if the competition was organized under the name of the country, the scale would be too large, resulting in a small area for a large number of people. Therefore, the three countries changed to participate under the name of the group. Swimming in our country is still in its infancy. It would be difficult for one group to compete against the strong. In order to resist this, it is planned to assemble Chen Jinpei, Li Mulong, Li Chengyuan, Chen Jindai, Liang Guoquan, Xia Zeren, Xu Yaotang, Chen Chunji, Zeng Xuezhong, Ye Guihong, Jian Erming, Yu Binqi, and other strong players to form a Chinese special team to participate. It is also planned to invite Zhou Jiaqi, Chen Zhang'e, Peng Sanmei, and Ling Xitao to be honorary instructors. Shanghai is vast and populous, and there must be people who are skilled in this field. Those who wish to participate can register at the All-China Sports Federation on Tiwen Tai Road by the 14th, providing detailed resumes for active training.</p>

<h3 id="e112">The Future of Tennis is Bright: Cheng Yize Initiates the Youyou Cup Singles Tournament <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>丨Encouraging the Spirit of New Youth and Fostering Exceptional Talent丨</p>
<p>The Tournament Adopts a Round-Robin System</p>
<p>No one in Shanghai who talks about sports is unaware of Cheng Yize. Mr. Cheng has been promoting sports for many years. He has a considerable reputation in football, tennis, basketball, and handball. He is both an enthusiastic and a practical person. Recently, seeing that the progress of tennis in our country is slow and difficult to survive in today's fiercely competitive world sports stage, he initiated the Youyou Cup Singles Tennis Tournament to encourage the spirit of new youth and foster exceptional talent. This is a ray of light for the future of the tennis community.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Origin of the Association <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Tennis has been popular in our country for many years. Although there are many people in our country who are good at it, there are very few who are skilled in it and can compete with famous players from around the world. Currently, the leaders of tennis in our country are only Mr. Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai, Jiang Daozhang, who are all overseas compatriots who have returned from afar. There are no other outstanding talents in the country. The reason why our country lacks tennis talents is because there is no adequate practice. The progress of ball skills depends entirely on the method of practice and research. If a strong player practices with a weaker player, the weaker player can benefit from observation. If a strong player practices with a strong player, they can learn from each other in the same practice. If this continues, the weaker player will not always be weak, and the stronger player will become stronger every day. The more people who practice, the more they will gain. Everyone has their own strengths. They can take the strengths of others, make up for their own weaknesses, research each other, and discuss together. How can their progress be limited? The establishment of tennis clubs in Shanghai is limited to members in terms of practice. This is also the case for tennis players in Shanghai schools. Outsiders are not allowed to participate. Even if a friend is introduced to join, it is only a one-off thing. How can the opportunity to practice satisfy their desires? Therefore, there are those who join various tennis competitions to seek to improve their ball skills. However, many of the rules use an elimination system, and there are many who have only one chance to fight. How can this system benefit practitioners? It is not enough to talk about them learning from each other. Therefore, I initiated this association. The purpose is to seek more competitions to practice more, to progress with different levels of competition, and to connect the feelings of tennis players in Shanghai. Therefore, a round-robin system is adopted, and it is hoped that a group can be formed to study carefully and discuss methods of ball skills so that they can show good skills on the world tennis stage in the future. However, because the matter is a new beginning, it is not convenient to open it to the public for anyone to join. Therefore, a special letter is sent to invite you to sponsor and participate. I am very fortunate. Respectfully, Cheng Yize, President of Youyou Sports Association.</p>

<p>Jinan University's emphasis on sports has long been praised. Its football team is particularly well-known, and its swimming team is also the best in Jiangnan. Recently, there has been good news regarding the football and swimming teams, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e117">Football Team Plans Overseas Expedition <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>| Expedition to the Philippines, Java, Singapore next summer |</p>
<p>| Large-scale plan takes shape |</p>
<p>The large-scale overseas expedition plan of the Jinan University football team has been rumored for some time, but it has only recently taken concrete form. The story is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e118">Motivation <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The motivation for Jinan's expedition arose earlier. Recently, a commercial inspection delegation from the Dutch East Indies in the South Seas came to Shanghai to inspect and visit Jinan. The head of the delegation, Zhuang Xiyan, is the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Batavia. He stated that in order to develop Chinese culture and sports, it was necessary for Jinan to send a football team on an expedition. Thus, the idea of an expedition was greatly promoted.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Negotiation <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Zhuang Xiyan then contacted sports, business, and press circles in Batavia, Java, and other places, who all agreed to support the plan. The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (Dutch Trading Society) offered 28,000 guilders for Jinan's expedition expenses. However, Zhuang recently returned from Japan and said that he was not satisfied with this amount and hoped for more.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Plan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The expedition plan is very large and will include the Philippines, Java, Annam, Malaya, Singapore, and other places. The number of matches will be over thirty. The team will depart next summer. Mr. Chen Zhang'e, the director of sports at Jinan, is currently selecting talent and providing ample training.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Swimming Team Prepares to Win <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>| YMCA preliminary selection tomorrow |</p>
<p>| Training camp in Qingyang Port |</p>
<p>The sports department of Jinan University, in order to maintain Jinan's Jiangnan University swimming championship, is preparing to organize a Jinan summer swimming team. They are scheduled to set up a training camp in Qingyang Port on the 15th of this month. Since the school has many students from Southeast Asia who are skilled in swimming, more than 100 people have signed up. However, due to concerns about insufficient funds and facilities, they have had to impose some restrictions. A preliminary selection will be held at the Chinese YMCA swimming pool at 9:30 AM tomorrow. The quota for men and women is set at 30 people. They will depart for Qingyang Port on the 15th. With such spirit, the championship will surely fall into Jinan's hands again.</p>

<p>Great Britain defeated Czechoslovakia in today's doubles match and won the Europe Zone of the Davis Cup. They will now compete with the United States for the Challenge Round. The results of the remaining two singles matches tomorrow will not affect the outcome, as Great Britain has already won 3-0.</p>

<p>After winning the first and second singles matches, Great Britain was confident in the doubles match. After taking the court, they won the first set 6-4. The Czech players suddenly put up fierce resistance and won the second set with the same result. Great Britain regained their spirit in the third set and played smoothly, resulting in a 6-4 victory. In the fourth set, they played casually and won easily with a score of 6-2.</p>

<p>It has been eleven years since Great Britain and the United States last met on the court. The reunion of old friends will surely bring many emotions. The United States has won the Challenge Round for the past four years. Great Britain has not had a taste of victory since 1919. In this tournament, Austin, White, and Hughes are showing their skills and restoring the former glory of British tennis. Their victory in the Europe Zone is just a small demonstration of their skills. The people of the country are hoping that they will defeat the United States and France. However, the United States has many famous players, and their chances in next week's competition are higher than those of France.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Foreign Minister Met with Shigemitsu Yesterday <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Discussed Handling the Aftermath of the Korean Incident First</p>
<p>Minister Wang Scheduled to Go to Qingdao Next Week</p>
<p>To Inspect Everything in Weihaiwei</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:00 AM on the night express from Beijing. At 10:00 AM, he went to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Fenglin Bridge. At 10:15 AM, he met with Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru to begin negotiations on the Korean anti-Chinese incident. After talking for about half an hour, Shigemitsu left. At that time, many Chinese, Japanese, and Korean journalists gathered at the Foreign Office to request an audience with Foreign Minister Wang, who met with each of them. At 4:40 PM in the afternoon, Foreign Minister Wang went to the Dahua Hotel to attend the 50th anniversary celebration of Mr. Yu Qiaqing's arrival in Shanghai and gave a very sincere speech. It is reported that Foreign Minister Wang is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight. Next week, he will go to Qingdao to attend the Jiaoji Railway Council meeting, and then to Weihaiwei for inspection. He will return to Beijing in about a week. The trip to Beidaihe has been canceled due to the tense diplomatic situation.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Foreign Minister Wang's Words <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>According to Foreign Minister Wang's statement to this newspaper's reporter regarding the content of yesterday morning's negotiations, Shigemitsu, in addition to conveying the Japanese government's intentions and expressing regret for the anti-Chinese incident, further discussed measures for handling the aftermath and remedies. Detailed content, related to diplomatic secrets, cannot be disclosed. Shigemitsu also briefly mentioned other outstanding issues between China and Japan and said that negotiations will continue in the future and will not be delayed due to the Korean incident. Wang also stated that the Chinese Consulate General in Korea was not destroyed and that he could vouch for it.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Shigemitsu's Statement <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu, after meeting with Foreign Minister Wang, made a statement to the Japanese press corps, saying that he had met with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting in the morning to discuss the Korean anti-Chinese incident. The detailed content of the conversation cannot be disclosed without mutual agreement. In short, he first provided a detailed explanation of the truth of the incident based on the Japanese government's reports to date. He stated that this unfortunate incident was a sudden event, and that it would not be in the interest of either party if it led to a deterioration of relations between China and Japan. Regarding the issue of handling the aftermath of the Korean incident, both sides agreed to seek a proper solution based on previous good relations. He also said that the protest submitted by the Chinese side has been forwarded to the Japanese government.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Foreign Minister Wang's Opinion on the Korean Anti-Chinese Incident <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Suspicious Clues Not Without Doubt</p>
<p>Official Negotiations After Investigation</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Has Already Remitted Funds for Relief</p>
<p>Regarding the Korean anti-Chinese incident, all parties have said that there is someone else who is directing the instigation. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, when meeting with reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office yesterday morning, was asked about this issue.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Personal Speculation <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Wang replied that, according to his personal speculation, the Korean riot was ostensibly caused by the Wanbaoshan incident. However, the fact that riots occurred simultaneously in various cities within Korea, which are far apart, within 24 hours, indicates that there was preparation. Otherwise, there would be no such coincidence. However, before there is concrete evidence, he would not venture to express any opinion on this.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Responsibility Issue <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Minister Wang Rongbao, stationed in Japan, to go to Korea immediately to investigate the truth of the riots in order to clarify the issue of responsibility. If there is indeed a background, then the killing of our compatriots is attributed to the instigator, and there is public opinion on the matter. Even if not, the Japanese authorities' failure to protect is also undeniable. Therefore, our side should wait for Minister Wang to complete the investigation and return to report before initiating formal negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Accurate Number of Deaths and Injuries <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>There is still no accurate count of the number of Chinese citizens killed and injured in Korea. As of now, based on the reports received from various parties, the number of deaths is about 80 to 90, and the number of seriously injured is over 100. It is expected that an accurate number will be announced within three days. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from Consul General Zhang yesterday, stating that the Korean riots have mostly stopped, but there may still be sporadic incidents in the countryside. Regarding the issue of handling the aftermath for the compatriots, the Ministry of Finance has remitted funds to Korea for emergency relief. The amount varies in different places, about several thousand yuan each.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Separate Protests <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang also said that it is ignorant to say that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet protested. Since receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in accordance with international practice, instructed Minister Wang in Japan to protest to Foreign Minister Shidehara, and at the same time, used his name to send a letter of protest to Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu. The Japanese government is scheduled to give a formal response within a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Two Distinct Matters <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Although the Korean anti-Chinese incident originated from the Wanbaoshan incident, the nature of the two matters is completely different. The Wan incident is entirely a local matter, and Jilin's Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs, Zhong Yu, has been instructed to handle the negotiations locally.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Easy to Judge Right and Wrong <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The right and wrong of the Wanbaoshan incident are easiest to judge. Even if both parties are Chinese, if Party A digs a ditch and infringes on Party B's farmland, Party B will inevitably fight for its own interests. Even if the government wants to demarcate private land for public interest, it must provide reasonable compensation. Moreover, Party A is a foreigner who is unreasonable to such an extent. This can be said to be inhumane.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Sino-French Study Delegation <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Wang said at the end that the Sino-French academic study delegation is for academic study and research and has no relationship with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chairman Chu Minyi of the Chinese delegation telegraphed to suspend the progress. The telegrams were sent separately to five ministries, not just the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Now that they are not allowed to proceed, it should be easy to handle. For example, if a landlord allows a guest to view the flowers in his back garden, and the guest does not follow the rules and breaks the flowers and trees in the garden, the landlord will see it and order him to leave, then this guest has nothing to argue. This matter is similar, so there is no big problem.</p>

Secretary Xu received them, as well as Vice Minister Wang Jiazhen of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Secretary Wang Pinsheng of the Executive Yuan, Vice Ministers Zhao Jinqing and Zhang Yiou of the Ministry of Industry, etc. Due to time constraints, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Central Party Headquarters only submitted a document. The results were very satisfactory. They returned to Shanghai on the night train on the 9th.</p>

<p>The Korean Community Association in Shanghai received a telegram from Seoul, Korea, at 3:30 PM on the 10th, saying: "Riots temporarily stopped, people uneasy, Chinese merchants closed, aftermath awaits government personnel to handle, Shanghai Association quickly urge authorities to relieve the suffering." At 7:00 PM, a telegram was received from Busan: "Turmoil is tight, market is fearful, Busan temporarily closed market." At the same time, a telegram was received from Wonsan: "Three thousand merchants and workers seeking refuge in consulate, market unstable." Yesterday, a telegram was received from Incheon: "Hoping for quiet, market closed."</p>

<p>Wang Zhengting said, "I am very honored to be here today to participate in this grand meeting. Today is the 50th anniversary of Mr. Yu Qiaqing's arrival in Shanghai, and it is of great significance to hold this celebration here, because it can publicize Mr. Yu's achievements for the country and society in the past 50 years to all the guests and make them a good example to inspire their ambitions and devote themselves to the country. The most commendable thing in Mr. Yu's life is his hard work. There are several kinds of hard work: working for personal interests, working for family and children, working for personal reputation, but Mr. Yu is indeed working for the country and society. Throughout his life, he has never had the slightest selfish or self-interested concept. Furthermore, there are several kinds of hard work: hard work for a few months, hard work for a few years, but there is no one who has continued to work as hard as Mr. Yu, who can be said to be the same as one day for 50 years, which can be a model for young people. Premier Sun Yat-sen said that he hoped that young people would strive to become great entrepreneurs, not great officials. Mr. Yu is today's great entrepreneur and can be a model for young people across the country."</p>

<p>Most Have Already Obtained Manufacturing Orders</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Has Also Ordered Customs to Change</p>
<p>The new weights and measures system in this city has been unified. The Social Security Bureau began a major inspection yesterday. As a result, many have implemented the new system. As for the customs weights and measures, the Ministry of Finance has ordered them to be changed. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e163">Inspection Situation <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, five inspectors from the Weights and Measures Testing Institute, accompanied by armed police officers from the Public Security Bureau, went to Huinan District Huiguan Street, Laotaiping Street, and Xintaiping Street to inspect. A total of 54 shops were inspected. Most of them had order forms from the manufacturing plant and were asked to go and pick them up and exchange them. Some have already implemented the new system, but a few are still using old instruments. A stamp was placed on the old instruments, and they were ordered to modify them and submit a guarantee. At the same time, the old instruments were registered. The guarantee paper is as follows: "I, the guarantor, hereby submit to the Shanghai Municipal Weights and Measures Testing Institute Public Security Bureau District No. I, a merchant, am willing to obey the order to change all the weights and measures I need to the new system before the month. I will never violate it. The guarantee is true. Guarantor's address street number, Republic of China date year month day." The inspectors were very friendly, so most shops were willing to guarantee that they would change to the new instruments.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, because the city's weights and measures have been declared uniform, but the customs still follows the old system, making it quite inconvenient to declare goods, weigh them, store them, and ship them out, has specially petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs to devise a proper solution. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday met with Zhou Zanming, the director of the Inspection and Verification Office, who said that regarding customs weights and measures, the Ministry of Industry has already requested the Ministry of Finance to order the customs to quickly adopt the new system, and at the same time ordered the Tariff Commission to revise the tariffs according to the new system. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also consulted with the ambassadors of various countries to change the weights and measures in the commercial treaties to the new system. Therefore, the customs will soon implement the new system.</p>

<p>Public Opposition Unabated in Various Locations</p>
<p>Anti-Drug Association Asks for Attention on Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, previously opposing the establishment of the Opium Prohibition Investigation Bureau by the opium prohibition authorities, which implemented the collection of opium taxes and openly sold opium, violating the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's instructions, contacted various organizations to jointly oppose it. Party departments and the public in various places also protested one after another, with letters and telegrams flying like snowflakes, as detailed in previous reports. It is heard that in recent days, various places have continued to protest, expressing serious opposition, including the Fujian Provincial Party Department, the Hebei Provincial Party Department, the Nanjing Municipal Party Department, the Tianjin Municipal Party Department, the Huangyan County Party Department, the Tangxi District Party Department, the Deqing District Party Department, the Pinghu County Party Department, the Jinhua County Party Department, the Jiangshan County Party Department, the Hangzhou All-Circles Commemoration of the Northern Expedition Oath Rally, the Fuzhou General Chamber of Commerce, the Fuzhou National Anti-Drug Association, the Fujian De-Addiction General Society, the Fujian Opium Prohibition Committee, the Wuxing Newspaper Reporters Association, the Suzhou All-Circles Joint Conference, the Shanghai Coal Industry Guild, the Civil Shipbuilding Guild, the Shanghai Citizen United Association, the Second District Branch, the Shanghai Banking Association, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association, the Shanghai Ratepayers Association in the Concessions, the National Council of Churches of Christ in China, and dozens of other organizations. The Shandong Provincial Government, the Fujian Provincial Government, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government have also expressed their views. The Zhejiang Provincial Party Department has even issued a notice to all party departments in the province, prohibiting party members from participating in any work of the Investigation Bureau, and those who violate this will be dealt with as a violation of the late Premier's instructions. The Fujian Party Department, in conjunction with anti-drug organizations, is conducting large-scale propaganda for opium prohibition and national salvation, with unprecedented public fervor. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association is currently compiling the opposition facts from various places into a special publication for commemoration. The "Collection of Essays Against Opium Public Sales" currently published by the Association has been selling briskly in recent days. Although it was published not long ago, there are few copies left, and it is expected that it will be reprinted soon. In addition, the book "A Glimpse of Opium Prohibition in Taiwan" written by Huang JiaHui, the general manager of the Association, has been completed and sent to the printer, and will be published soon. It is heard that the Association, because the Investigation Bureaus in various places have been abolished due to public opposition, is sincerely concerned that those who advocate public sales may change their tactics and use other names, falsely claiming to prohibit opium, in order to seek great profits. Yesterday, it specifically notified anti-drug organizations in various places that they must not relax their opposition to public sales or disguised public sales due to the abolition of the Investigation Bureau. They should still closely monitor the opium prohibition measures in various places at all times to prevent the other party from making a comeback. If there are any measures that violate the late Premier's instructions on opium prohibition, they should contact local people to discuss them together in order to save the country from danger.</p>

<p>Currently Estimating Various Damages</p>
<p>Requesting Compensation from Nissin Again</p>
<p>Regarding our recent measures to take over the Nissin Company's Yangtze Wharf, Xu Shidan, the representative of the Ministry of Communications, told the Far Eastern News Agency yesterday that after taking over the Yangtze Wharf on the 8th of this month, the next day (the 9th), together with the Navigation Administration Bureau, inspected all the machinery in the wharf's warehouses and registered them. The situation has been briefly reported in the newspapers. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 10th), the Japanese staff who used to work at the Yangtze Wharf came and claimed that the Japanese side did not recognize the handover of the wharf and requested to enter the office to work. After rejecting their unreasonable request, the Japanese staff left on their own. Currently, in addition to reporting the takeover process to the Ministry of Communications, a building architect and inspector from the Mottuon Company have been specially hired to be responsible for estimating the damage and repair costs of the warehouses and wharves in order to seek compensation from the Nissin Company. As for the outstanding rent, legal procedures are being prepared to recover it from the Japanese side.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Scheduled to Discuss Standard Contract Forms <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Afternoon of the 14th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to various organizations stating that the Chinese merchant order forms in this city have never had a fixed format. The ones currently used are based on the terms and conditions set by foreign firms, and their contents are often one-sided. Therefore, once a dispute arises and litigation occurs, Chinese merchants are bound by the terms and conditions and inevitably fail, losing their rights and interests to a great extent. Therefore, at the second member congress, the Cotton Fabric Industry Association of this city proposed to the congress that the Chamber of Commerce quickly produce a standard order form for purchasing goods from foreign merchants for use by various industries. The proposal was approved. Now, after considering the circumstances of various industries, a standard order form has been drafted. In order to gather ideas from all parties, it has been decided to invite representatives from various import and export organizations in this city to come to the Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 p.m. on July 14th to discuss it together. It is hoped that you will investigate and dispatch one representative to attend the meeting on schedule to share your valuable opinions.</p>

<p>Since May of this year, the entire Shanghai County's slaughter tax has been contracted out to Wang Shoumei, who has been collecting taxes in various ways since taking over the contract. According to the report submitted to the county government, the meat merchants in Minhang have been delaying payment on various pretexts. Even after sending a letter to the First Branch of the County Police Bureau to dispatch police for persuasion, it was ineffective. They all claimed that "We will pay if Mr. Luo Guoging tells us to pay." It is found that Luo is the chairman of the meat industry association. Such manipulation and procrastination will be difficult to continue. Please instruct, etc. After receiving the report, County Head Yan believed that if the report was true, it was indeed inappropriate. Therefore, yesterday, he instructed the Minhang Chamber of Commerce to investigate the facts and earnestly persuade them to pay in accordance with the rules in order to maintain special education funds.</p>

<p>Ministry of Finance Approved the Embroidery Industry Association</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a proposal from the Embroidery Industry Association stating that embroidery products sold overseas should be allowed to request tax-free release from the customs in accordance with regulations, and to submit to the Ministry for review in accordance with the incentive rules.

<p>Workers Given Compensation and Dismissed</p>
<p>The sauce industry workers in this city, because the French Concession's Gong Shen Sauce Garden dismissed workers Zhou Dalin and Yao Wangsheng, and ordered other workers to fill out guarantees as a condition of employment, a labor dispute occurred. After self-negotiations broke down, they petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs for assistance. In order to quickly resolve the issue, the Bureau summoned both parties for questioning in order to conduct mediation. Because the employer insisted on not allowing reinstatement, it was impossible to resolve the issue. With the consent of both parties, the chairman provided food and lodging to those who were dismissed, while waiting for a resolution. The next day late at night, the workers were forcibly driven out by unemployed vagrants and had to temporarily stay in the union. Upon hearing the news, all sauce industry workers in the city were quite angry and willing to support them. At 9:00 a.m. on the day before yesterday (the 10th), the Bureau of Social Affairs officially mediated. The employer's representatives Zhang Licheng and Mei Shouci, the sauce industry union's representatives Weng Zhenda and Zhang Junyin, Chairman Zhu Guilin, and Recorder Wang Zhixin were present. The labor side demanded reinstatement, but the employer insisted on not allowing it. The two sides argued fiercely. After repeated persuasion by the chairman, the two sides finally agreed to sign and resolved the issue at 2:00 p.m. The original text of the agreement is recorded below: (1) Workers Zhou Tuan and others, Zhang Shurong, Zhang Jinyun, Zhang Wenrong, and Zhou Dongshan are allowed to terminate their employment relationship with the employer. (2) Workers Zhou Tianlin and Yao Wangsheng are allowed to be dismissed. The employer will subsidize each person with 35 yuan.</p>

<p>Respect Central Government's Decisions, Oppose Contractors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Liang Wine Industry Association, because Wang Bi, the director of the Shangbao Opium and Alcohol Public Sales Branch Bureau, was soliciting merchants to contract out the collection of white wine public sales fees, and unilaterally increased the public sales prices, specially convened a meeting of all members yesterday afternoon to discuss relief measures. Over 30 members of the Association attended, chaired by Huang Yuming. The meeting was opened as usual. The chairperson reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that since the establishment of the Jiangsu Province Opium and Alcohol Public Sales since the fourth year of the Republic, the countryside had been contracted out to various fellow merchants. This year, the government, in compliance with the resolution, and in order to eliminate embezzlement and rectify the tax policy, has uniformly changed to government operation. However, Wang Bi, the director of the Shangbao Opium and Alcohol Branch Bureau, has been soliciting merchants to contract out various collection offices since taking office. After merchant Wu Jun contracted the white wine collection office, he increased the public sales price to 8 yuan. The sorghum wine fee was uniformly increased by 25% of the original price. The meeting was specially convened to discuss measures with fellow merchants. Next, Shi Youqing, Zhang Guanshou, Zhu Qingtang, and others spoke successively, stating that the government clearly ordered government operation, but the director of the Shangbao Opium and Alcohol Bureau was soliciting merchants to contract out collection offices, extorting taxes that were not to be done by officials under the clear sky. Wu Jun estimated the contracting out when the white wine public sales price was 6.5 yuan, but now he increased it to 8 yuan for no reason. This city uses a pound scale, which is different from the estimations in other places, causing merchants to suffer a lot. Unilaterally increasing the public sales price to enrich contractors, this industry opposes contractors in order to respect the central government's resolutions. Then, it was resolved (1) That the Shangbao Opium and Alcohol Public Sales Branch Bureau illegally solicited merchants to contract out collection offices, and the Association should publish the truth in the newspaper and petition the competent authorities to oppose the case. (2) Omitted. (3) Shao Weigao falsely pretended to be a white wine collection office inspector and arbitrarily detained the wine of Tongxin Chang Wine Shop. Petition the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request a thorough investigation and strict handling of the case. (4) Passed. The Association's meeting rules and detailed operating rules were discussed. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Replacing Well Water with Tap Water</p>
<p>Previously, the Jiangnan Lane on Xie Xu Road in the southern part of Shanghai only had wells. The residents obtained all their drinking water and water for washing from these wells, which were extremely filthy. The Municipal Council, upon receiving a letter from the residents requesting action, dispatched personnel to investigate. They found that the lane had over thirty houses with four old wells. The wells were in disrepair, and the well walls were dilapidated. Furthermore, the drainage ditches in the lane were also broken, allowing sewage to seep in, making the water quality very poor. The Municipal Council considered the unclean drinking water a health hazard, especially during the hot summer months, raising concerns about potential epidemics. As a result, the Council ordered the property owners to completely seal and discontinue the use of these wells by the 15th of this month and to switch to tap water. It is also reported that a notice has been posted in the lane stating that if the property owners fail to comply by the deadline, the residents can arrange for the change themselves, and the expenses will be deducted from the rent.</p>

<p>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital has already opened. On the first day of outpatient service, there were more than fifty patients, including four severe cases requiring hospitalization, which is more than in previous years. This is because the Hongkou area has numerous factories and a dense population, with many boat dwellers and shack residents clustered there. They generally lack hygiene knowledge and lack the financial resources to seek medical care. The prevalence of epidemics is therefore inevitable. The hospital's medical directors, Lin Chunshan and Zhu Xiaofang, recognizing this, have added Dr. Zhu Yu'an to the team, in addition to the original doctors Lin Taifei and Shi Yongqi, to assist in the medical work.</p>

<p>Twenty Players Went on Strike Last Night</p>
<p>The Jai-Alai Stadium located at the intersection of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession has been doing well since its opening. The stadium originally hired twenty Jai-Alai players from Spain under a two-year contract, specifying their salaries. However, due to poor business in the early stages, the manager and the players agreed that they would temporarily receive half their salaries, and the full salaries would be restored when the business recovered. In recent months, the business has been profitable, and the players collectively requested the management to restore their full salaries. They initially made a written request, which the management ignored. The players then signed a final request and gave a 24-hour deadline for a response. As of 7:00 PM last night, the deadline had passed, and the management had not responded. As a result, they all went on strike. Those who went to the Jai-Alai Stadium last night found the doors tightly closed and returned disappointed.</p>

He claimed to have just arrived in Shanghai from the North and intended to seek admission to a suitable school. He then stayed in room 27 on the third floor of the apartments. The room had two beds, and a merchant from Shanxi named Lan Yongsheng, who had come to Shanghai from Jin, was also staying in the same room. In the past few days, Wu had been frowning and appeared to be in great pain. However, at around 6:00 PM last night, Lan was chatting with him to relieve his loneliness. Before they could say a few words, Wu suddenly got up and walked to the window. Lan thought he was just pulling the curtain to get some air. In an instant, Wu suddenly jumped down. Lan shouted for help. When he went downstairs to check, Wu was lying motionless on the ground and had lost consciousness. The apartment's accountant reported the incident to the police, who sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is rumored that Wu's attempt to commit suicide was due to economic pressure.</p>

<p>Triggered by the Private Taking of a Bamboo Pole</p>
<p>The dock workers at the Xin Sanjing Wharf in Pudong are divided into Ningbo and Taizhou gangs, and quarrels often occur. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 PM, Jia Mingyun, a Taizhou foreman leading dozens of workers, went to the dock to work. Among them, a worker named Song Huachang secretly took a bamboo pole from the Ningbo gang's basket while no one was watching. He was caught by Lou Zhongxin, the foreman of the Ningbo gang, who accused him of theft, which led to a quarrel. The two sides then gathered dozens of workers from their respective gangs, armed with coal shovels and bamboo sticks, and fought fiercely. As a result, both sides were injured to varying degrees. The Ningbo gang, being fewer in number, suffered more severe injuries. Lu Maogou, Lu Shigao, and Lou Qimiao were seriously injured and unable to move. Others, such as Yu Xiaogui, Chen Zhongfeng, and Wang Wenbao, suffered head injuries and were bleeding, but their injuries were less severe. The injured from the Taizhou gang were Song Huachang and Hua Bu Ao. Afterwards, Lou Zhongxin of the Ningbo gang reported the incident to the Fourth Detachment of the Police, which immediately dispatched all the officers to the scene to make arrests. The workers dispersed. The two foremen, Lou Zhongxin and Jia Mingyun, and the eight injured workers, including Lu Maogou, were taken to the Third District. The district chief ordered the seriously injured to be sent to the Pudong Hospital for treatment and detained the others to await transfer to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Repeatedly Questioned, She Remains Silent</p>
<p>The Nanyang Maru of the Nisshin Steamship Company set sail from Hankou on the 8th of this month and sailed to Shanghai. As usual, the ticket inspector on board checked the passengers' tickets. A young girl was found in the cabin without any companions. When asked about her background, she said her name was Liu Fukui, 14 years old, originally from Hunan, and lived in a brothel at 61 Sanfen Li, Hankou. When asked why she was traveling alone at such a young age, the girl suddenly lowered her head and remained silent. She did not answer despite repeated questioning. Her behavior was suspicious, and it was feared that she had been abducted by villains and had escaped on her own. Therefore, when the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, it was intended to send the girl to the Jiliang Institute for temporary care to prevent her from becoming destitute. However, the girl cried incessantly due to language barriers. The company had no choice but to send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team. Chief Xu conducted a preliminary hearing, but the girl remained silent. It was ordered that a document be prepared and submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for proper placement.</p>

He used to work in Shanghai, but recently lost his job due to a leg disease. He had been unemployed for a long time and was suffering from poverty and illness. He had no choice but to take a bus to Song and intended to commit suicide by drowning in the sea, but he was afraid that his body would drift away, so he decided to hang himself. After the interrogation, he was ordered to be sent to the Wusong Rende Association for arrangements. The association provided him with five dollars for travel expenses and sent him back to his hometown by bus.</p>

<p>Parents Pressured Her to Return Home</p>
<p>Daughter Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Zhang Yan, also known as Zhang Meixian, a 19-year-old woman from Huzhou, lived in Dongzha, Linghu Town. She attended a small school for six years and had a junior high school education. Her father, Zhang Jinjia, sold her to a Chen family in Shangyu as a concubine. After entering the household, the woman, unwilling to be a concubine, came to Shanghai a month ago and rented a room upstairs in the Qiashen Coal Shop at 114 Xizi Laihuo Street in the French Concession. A few days ago, her father and mother came to Shanghai and pressured her to return home. As a result, the woman suddenly had a suicidal thought and secretly swallowed raw opium and preserved plums at 11:00 PM on the 10th. When the poison took effect, her parents noticed and immediately sent her to Renji Hospital. Due to severe poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 8:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the police station to send detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Examination Office for an autopsy.

<p>Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison</p>
<p>Lingdi, the adopted daughter of Chen Zhou, a local woman residing at 45 Huade Road, is twenty years old and unmarried. She is somewhat attractive. Ye Shisong, a former tenant from Shaoxing, had long desired her. However, Lingdi's adoptive mother, Chen Zhou, was very strict and provided no opportunity. On the morning of the 6th of this month at around 6:00 AM, Lingdi suddenly disappeared. Chen searched everywhere without success and asked around, eventually reporting the incident to the Huishan Police Station. Chinese detective Cai Zhitian learned that she had been abducted by Ye and hidden in a bungalow in Longhua. He secretly went there the day before yesterday and, together with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, arrested Ye and took Chen Lingdi back to the police station. Lingdi was handed back to her mother, Chen Zhou, and Ye Shisong was detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the facts of the case and requested prosecution. Chen Zhou stated that Lingdi had been her adopted daughter since the age of five and was now twenty years old, but her birthday was December 25, the Year of the Rat. The defendant had lived opposite her as her tenant. She briefly recounted the events. Lingdi stated that although she knew the defendant, there was no improper relationship. She had been deceived by him that morning and taken to the home of his friend in Longhua, where he asked her to marry him. Fortunately, she did not lose her virginity. When questioned, Ye Shisong's testimony was evasive. He claimed that Lingdi had not been abducted by him but by someone named Lin and pleaded for leniency. Judge Xiao Xie fen, after reviewing the testimony, determined that the girl's testimony had been proven, and there was no room for evasion. He sentenced Ye Shisong to eight months in prison as a warning.</p>

The committee responsible for drafting the regulations did not neglect the issue of designing and maintaining roads beyond the settlement boundaries. Article 6 of the regulations stipulates that leaseholders and others eligible to vote at the general meeting may, at the annual meeting, approve "the purchase of land leading to or located outside the settlement boundaries, or, under conditions mutually agreed upon by the Public Works Department and Chinese or foreign owners, the acquisition of land owned by such Chinese or foreign owners for the construction of roads, the establishment of parks, and other recreational facilities." This provision clearly aimed to provide a legal basis for the actions of the then Public Works Department, namely, the Department's approval of the request from the shareholders of Jing'an Temple Road to acquire the land for its construction, its commitment to maintain the road, and, in general, its ability to accept responsibility for maintaining other roads outside the settlement boundaries and to implement its policies for their layout and maintenance. However, since the Public Works Department exercised its vested powers, the nature and scale of its development were beyond what the drafters of the 1866 land regulations could have foreseen. The provisions of Article 6 of the regulations have proven to be far from adequate to meet the needs of the situation created by this development. Based on Article 6, the expropriation of land outside the settlement boundaries for road construction and the acquisition of other roads built by private enterprises have been practiced for about sixty years. However, during the first half of these sixty years, the Public Works Department incurred significant expenses in maintaining and preserving these roads, which could not be offset except by voluntary donations from foreigners who owned or rented houses in the areas served by these roads. Therefore, the Department was reluctant to greatly expand its responsibility for maintaining roads outside the settlement boundaries. In 1899, the boundaries of the International Settlement were expanded by adding land in the northwest districts. At that time, all Public Works Department roads outside the settlement boundaries were about thirteen miles long and extended beyond the newly added districts. Of these roads outside the settlement boundaries, eight and a half miles were within the newly added areas, while the remaining four and thirty-four hundredths miles, including most of Jing'an Temple Road and Xujiahui Road, remained outside the expanded boundaries of the International Settlement. After the expansion of the International Settlement in 1899, further land acquisitions were made outside the settlement boundaries for road construction. By 1901, plans had been made for thirteen miles of new roads outside the settlement boundaries, including the first section of Hongqiao Road and Route Cardinal Mercier. In January 1918, there were a total of 29.893 miles of roads outside the settlement boundaries, of which 2.534 miles were located in the Western District and 4.553 miles were located in the Northern District. Mostly due to the new roads planned by the Public Works Department in 1924 and 1925, the total number of roads outside the settlement boundaries increased to 48.093 miles in the Western District, outside the arc-shaped railway tracks (20.934 miles within the tracks and 22.071 miles outside the tracks) and 5.088 miles in the Northern District. The acquisition of land needed for road construction outside the settlement boundaries and the construction of new roads outside the settlement boundaries ceased at the end of 1925. The report traces the development of residential areas along roads outside the settlement boundaries, partly based on population statistics. These statistics show that in 1870, there were only 52 foreigners living along roads outside the settlement boundaries, which gradually increased to 441 in 1895. In 1900, due to the expansion of the International Settlement in 1899, all roads outside the settlement boundaries were incorporated into the settlement, and the number of foreigners living along roads outside the settlement boundaries suddenly decreased to 80. By 1905, the number had risen again to 505, and by 1910, it had increased to 1,260. Since then, the number has continued to increase. According to the 1930 census, there were as many as 9,506 foreigners living along roads outside the settlement boundaries. It was then noted that, in addition to residences occupied by foreigners, there were also a considerable number of houses occupied by Chinese, and that commerce and industry were also highly developed, mostly in areas adjacent to the boundaries of the International Settlement. The report reveals that, due to the gradual development of suburban areas outside the settlement boundaries, the issue of the Public Works Department's exercise of administrative powers over industries adjacent to these roads became increasingly important. In addition to road construction and maintenance, and drainage projects, the work gradually undertaken by the Public Works Department is divided into three categories: (1) police affairs, (2) public health, and (3) taxation, as described below. (1) Police affairs: The initial necessity for setting up police patrols was mainly to control vehicular traffic and protect the Public Works Department's property. Later, a problem arose, namely, the protection of residents living along roads outside the settlement boundaries. In 1884, the stationing of a troop of Chinese soldiers near the racecourse led to the Jing'an Temple Road incident, which made this problem urgent. The general public was deeply concerned that the disturbance would not only affect the residents along roads outside the settlement boundaries but also the International Settlement in general. Therefore, police forces were strengthened in the surrounding areas, and a small house was rented on Carter Road for use as a police station. In February 1885, the Public Works Department, believing that the period of danger had passed, planned to abolish the increased police protection, but the residents of the surrounding areas opposed this move and requested that private donations be used to maintain the increased police force along roads outside the settlement boundaries. In February 1885, the ratepayers' annual meeting passed a resolution instructing the Public Works Department to continue its increased police measures, conditional on the people donating the funds for this purpose. The report mentions this matter, recognizing it as sufficient proof of "an inevitable development in the establishment of police along roads outside the settlement boundaries." The report also mentions how the Mixed Court and its successor court exercised their jurisdiction over cases occurring along roads outside the settlement boundaries, Article 36 of the annex passed by the 1919 ratepayers' meeting, which stipulates that traffic regulations apply not only to streets within the International Settlement but also to any Public Works Department roads and lanes outside the settlement boundaries, and the ruling of the British Supreme Court for China in 1921, which ordered the police court to punish foreigners who violate traffic regulations along roads outside the settlement boundaries. The report further points out that, at the time the Supreme Court declared its judgment, it did not rule on the question of whether the Public Works Department had the power to enact this annex in accordance with the land regulations, as Article 28 of the land regulations stipulates that this question should be determined by international negotiations, not by the courts. However, it also believes that, on the surface, the annex has the elements of legality and validity. The report also notes that, since the British Supreme Court for China announced the aforementioned judgment, it has become customary for the courts to handle cases of traffic violations along roads outside the settlement boundaries in accordance with the said annex. (2) Public health: The report indicates that, in order to maintain the cleanliness of the roads and protect public health, the Public Works Department found it necessary to extend its street cleaning work to roads outside the settlement boundaries. (3) Taxation: The difficulties in collecting voluntary donations to cover the expenses incurred by the Public Works Department in administering roads outside the settlement boundaries, including the establishment of police forces, are described, and it is stated that the Public Works Department had difficulty in collecting these donations. In 1905, the Public Works Department asked the ratepayers' annual meeting to approve the addition of a clause to its contract with the water company, namely, that the company should not supply water to residents living along roads outside the settlement boundaries unless they were willing to pay the Public Works Department a special donation for all their houses located outside the settlement boundaries, the amount of which should not exceed that payable for similar houses within the settlement. The report also points out that similar clauses were added to subsequent contracts between the Public Works Department and other public utility companies, and that the Public Works Department was thus able to collect regular donations from residents living along roads outside the settlement boundaries who benefited from the services of these companies, based on contracts concluded with public utility companies. The attitude of the Chinese authorities towards the Public Works Department's road construction outside the settlement boundaries and its exercise of administrative powers over roads outside the settlement boundaries is then discussed, and the following facts are revealed. The areas reached by the Public Works Department's roads outside the settlement boundaries were mostly rural in nature when the Department acquired land for road construction. During the first forty years of the aforementioned development period, i.e., until about 1906, the Chinese authorities did not design any administrative system for these areas other than the usual semi-family-style local governance to meet the needs of Chinese villages and villagers. The villages were still lacking in the establishment of a municipal administration to meet the needs of modern urban or semi-urban Chinese and foreign societies, and this lack made the gradual expansion of the Public Works Department's activities not only possible but also practically inevitable. The Chinese people in the areas directly related to roads outside the settlement boundaries were able to recognize the various benefits created by the construction and maintenance of these roads. Landowners were able to obtain favorable land prices when land was purchased or allocated for road construction, and the value of the remaining land also increased as a result of the road construction. The actual work of road construction provided the villagers with paid employment, and after the roads were built, transportation became more convenient, allowing agricultural products to be transported to the settlement markets for sale. The extension of the Public Works Department's roads outside the settlement boundaries also benefited the majority of Chinese people in and near the International Settlement, as the roads made it possible to build houses on land of lower value, which the Chinese people were happy to rent, and they could enjoy the benefits of the various municipal services provided by the Public Works Department without paying or with paying reduced house taxes. The report notes that, except for one or two occasions, in the initial years, the Chinese authorities did not seem to prevent the Public Works Department from expropriating land for the construction of roads outside the settlement boundaries, nor did they oppose the Department's construction and maintenance of these roads. However, in 1906, when a Chinese municipal institution was established in the area north of the section of the International Settlement boundary bordering the Suzhou River, known as "Zhabei," the attitude of the Chinese authorities changed. The opposition of the Chinese government to the plans to establish police and collect taxes on roads outside the settlement boundaries began with its opposition to the Public Works Department's exercise of its powers in the area adjacent to the northern district of Zhabei. The lack of training and discipline among the police officers set up by the Chinese authorities in the area, and the methods used by these officers to exercise their powers, further aggravated the situation. The 1908 annual report of the Public Works Department mentioned the various accidents that occurred during that year and stated that "conflicts between police and water workers continued unabated in the entire area of the northern boundary." Since then, the issue of police on roads outside the settlement boundaries has become a point of contention between the Public Works Department and the Chinese authorities. This point of contention has sometimes been temporarily resolved, especially when there was panic in various parts of Shanghai due to civil war, at which time residents and merchants in Zhabei requested assistance from the Public Works Department to protect the area from the danger of invasion. However, the disputed issue has not been resolved. The details of the aforementioned disputes between the Public Works Department and the Chinese authorities need not be described one by one. What should be noted is that the disputes between the two sides progressed again in 1918, when the Chinese authorities exercised their influence over the local chiefs in various areas to obstruct the Public Works Department from acquiring more land outside the International Settlement for road construction. The Chinese authorities' opposition to the Public Works Department's acquisition of land for road construction and the construction of new roads outside the settlement boundaries was based on the grounds that all such proposals involved infringing upon Chinese territory and interfering with Chinese sovereignty, and also partly out of concern that the Public Works Department's extension of roads outside the settlement boundaries would eventually lead to the implementation of some new and more ambitious plan to expand the International Settlement. Although the Chinese authorities opposed it, the landowners and residents in the areas affected or likely to be affected by the Public Works Department's plan to extend roads outside the settlement boundaries continued to express their welcome to this plan and often proactively contacted the Public Works Department and petitioned for road construction plans. However, since the political disturbances of 1925, the Chinese authorities have become more strongly opposed to the Public Works Department's ongoing plan to extend the roads in the Western District to locations beyond the railway tracks, and have also influenced the attitude of the villagers, with the result that some landowners whose land was affected by the Public Works Department's plan were unwilling to sell the land needed for road construction, and the method of establishing absolute sale deeds by the local chiefs and village elders became more difficult. Finally, in the second half of 1925, the Public Works Department decided not to continue acquiring land needed for the plan to extend roads outside the settlement boundaries.</p>

<h3 id="e236">The Strange Passenger Who Stowed Away Across the Atlantic <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Recently, in America, a businessman named John Suning married his sweetheart, Ms. Wu Shi, in a blissful ceremony. The guests were gathered, and there was much talk of the amusing tale of how they had met. No one who heard it could help but smile. For Suning was none other than the strange passenger who had once stowed away across the Atlantic without a penny to his name.</p>
<p>Suning was British. As a young man, he had many fantastic ideas in his head. Ordinary people often scoffed at them, saying they would never come to pass. But Suning paid them no heed. He was in love with a woman named Wu Shi, but her family was stingy with money, and they could not marry right away. He admired the wealth of America and wanted to go there to find work, so he could fulfill his long-cherished wish. But when he applied for a visa, he was met with obstacles at every turn, due to immigration laws and passport procedures. Even the cost of the passage was too much for Suning, who had exhausted all his resources. Disappointed, Suning did not lose heart. He happened to see a ship bound for America, carrying cargo that included a large wooden piano crate, big enough to hide in. So he bought some food and drink, and hid inside it. The crate, which looked like a coffin, was stored on the deck, and no one touched it. Suning was able to cross the Atlantic in safety.</p>
<p>When he arrived in New York, the customs officials discovered Suning, and his story immediately came to light. Because of his strange behavior, the people of New York were amazed and took notice of him. Fortunately, a manager at a certain morning newspaper heard about the matter and admired Suning's ambition. He hired him to work at the newspaper. Before long, Suning's sweetheart, Wu Shi, came to America with her sister, Helen. They eventually met again, and were formally married. Suning now works for a sculpting company and earns a good living. He and Wu Shi are enjoying their sweet life together. It is not uncommon for people to travel without paying their fare. For example, the movie star Hossade once offered to work as a stewardess on a ship, and got a free passage from England to Canada. And Simpson was able to travel back and forth between America and Germany, on a long trip, with only eight shillings to his name. But the story of Suning's stowaway voyage is truly unprecedented. It is certainly a story worth telling by a reporter.</p>

<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Lately, the word "ism" has become the most fashionable term. All kinds of isms are emerging in endless succession. One cannot enumerate them all. But one has never heard of a vegetarianism. For human beings depend on food for life. Without food, one cannot live. Therefore, all people in the world consider food to be essential. Yet now there is someone who advocates vegetarianism. How can we not regard this as a strange thing? This person is named Herz, an Englishman. He is still young, and can starve for dozens of days without dying. He promotes vegetarianism and preaches it everywhere, sparing no effort. Recently, in London, England, he fasted for fifty days straight, consuming only plain water, cigars, and cigarettes. Yet his complexion has not changed much. He claims that practicing vegetarianism makes one's body stronger.</p>
<h3 id="e238">A Story of an Old Woman from Jiangbei <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>In a certain place in Jiangbei, there was an old woman named Wang, who was exceptionally clever. She was very skilled at collecting money. She was a sorceress. It is said that she became a widow at the age of thirty. She had no children and was very poor. She depended on her mother's allowance to live. Soon her mother also passed away, and the allowance stopped abruptly. Fortunately, there was a sorceress next door, who made a great deal of money. The old woman envied her, so she apprenticed to her and learned all her secrets. When the sorceress died, the old woman inherited her mantle, claiming to be possessed by a god, and divining fortunes and curing diseases for people. She also learned massage from others, which was quite effective. Her medical reputation even surpassed that of the sorceress. She practiced for forty years, and her name became famous far and wide. Those seeking medical treatment and fortune-telling numbered dozens every day. Although the old woman claimed that she did not care about money, the price of one treatment or one fortune-telling increased day by day. Therefore, she accumulated a great fortune. The old woman lived very frugally, wearing coarse clothes and eating vegetables, which she enjoyed very much. Those who invited her to their homes for treatment, no matter how far away, she would walk there, looking like a poor woman. When asked, she would say, "The god has instructed me not to disobey." In fact, she loved money as much as life itself and was unwilling to spend it. However, the fact that she had accumulated a huge fortune was known to many. Kidnappers had long been eyeing her. One day, a young woman came, with a sorrowful face. When she saw the old woman, she knelt down and wept, saying, "My husband is critically ill. All medicines have been ineffective. I beg the god to have great mercy and come to my home." The old woman felt compassionate and helped her up. She inquired about her name and address and said, "You go first. I still have several people waiting for the god to bestow a prescription. I will come as soon as I am finished." The woman thanked her and left. About an hour later, the old woman finished her work and walked there. When she entered the door, she saw a burly man with a fierce face. She did not see the young woman who had invited her. Suspecting that it was not the home of the sick person, she turned to leave. The burly man stopped her and said, "Are you the old woman Wang? Do not go." The old woman was startled by the voice. In an instant, she knew that something was wrong. She calmly replied, "Is there a sick person in this house? Then I should go and inform the host." The burly man stared at the old woman's face and said, "What are you talking about?" The old woman said, "I am the servant of the old woman Wang. A woman invited my master to treat a patient. Because I did not hear the address clearly, I was afraid of making a mistake and was ordered to come and ask for clarification first. If there is indeed a patient seeking medical treatment in this house, then my master will come soon after I report back." The burly man stared at the old woman's face again for a while and said, "Now that you know the address, why do you need to ask for clarification? Hurry and bring the old woman Wang here." The old woman nodded and turned to leave. Although her heart was uneasy, her steps were not disordered. After leaving the door, she began to walk quickly home. It turned out that this burly man was indeed a kidnapper, who had lured the old woman Wang into his trap. The bandits did not recognize the old woman. The bandit who recognized the old woman happened to be in the back room, the owner of this house. The burly man was the leader of the owner of this house. He thought that the old woman possessed a huge fortune and must be exquisitely dressed. Seeing that the old woman was wearing coarse clothes, she looked like a servant. Her words were also unhesitating, clearly not a disguise after being discovered. Moreover, the bandit was confident that he had not been discovered. Therefore, the old woman Wang's resourcefulness and composure were truly beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p>
<h3 id="e239">A Record of the Birthday Celebration at Dafengtang <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Weizhai Jushi</p>
<p>The brothers Zhang Shanzi and Zhang Daqian from Sichuan Province, disciples of the two great masters Zeng Nongran and Li Meian, are known in the art world, both at home and abroad, for their poetry, calligraphy, and painting. It is an honor to acquire their works. They enjoy a reputation of the times. This year, in May, Shanzi celebrated his fiftieth birthday. He recently returned from a trip to Japan and Korea with Daqian and their families. He composed a poem, expressing his lofty ambition to retreat from the world. The poem reads: "Fifty years have flown by. Difficulties rest by the sea. If the green mountains could be sold, a humble home would be no obstacle. In old age, my spirit remains strong. My poems become more refined. The lotus roots of Weitang are plentiful. I will build a home to serve my beloved parents. My horse is strong. It gallops across the borders. I can learn from the monkey to brush off my sleeves. The tiger can rest in my paintings. I leave my unfinished manuscripts in the East. I remember my hometown in the West. I am ashamed of my undeserved fame. When will I stop scribbling?" It is said that Shanzi served as an official in the East Province in his youth. When Sichuan was in turmoil, his mother preferred to live in Jiangnan, so he came to Shanghai. Daqian served his mother in Weitang, enjoying the pleasures of Laizi. Therefore, the *Book of Changes* says, "Do not serve kings and lords, but hold high your ideals." The *Book of Odes* says, "A good wife and a long-lived mother bring joy to the Duke of Lu." From this, we can see the happiness of the Dafengtang family, and we can also see that Shanzi's great works are lofty and unconventional, with a special origin. On the eve of his birthday, friends in Shanghai, such as Binhong, Danlin, Haoran, Duhe, Shoujuan, Yingbin, Changming, Zuhan, Chuqing, Yuhu, Shizi, Geyi, Gongzhan, Wanli, and Tianjian, will each offer their congratulations in the form of calligraphy and painting. His hundreds of male and female disciples, many of whom are outstanding talents, are also noteworthy. His female disciple Pan Yibin embroidered a five-character birthday poem by hand, displaying her miraculous needle skills. Her work is unmatched at the time, and it is a source of pride for the school. I have had the pleasure of exchanging letters with the two gentlemen. I humbly present a short poem, recorded at the end of this article, to offer a toast. How many talented people are there in the art world? Who stands at the peak of the mountains? The wind howls for ninety thousand miles. The plum blossoms have a longevity of a thousand years. In his spare time, he paints tigers and leopards. He boasts about his straw sandals. He records his grand tour to the sea. The brothers are both immortals. (A humble reply)</p>

<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>There are quite a few Korean youths studying in Europe, America, and China. They are unwilling to be dominated and humiliated in their own country and can only seek development abroad. However, unfortunately, even if they succeed in their studies, they are still constrained by the situation and cannot return home. Even if they do, there is no use for their knowledge. How can this be? Presumably, those who return from overseas have, needless to say, advanced ideas and broad knowledge. When they think about how other countries are rich and powerful, they feel that everything about themselves is lagging behind. They cannot bear to see it, and their words and actions will always reveal attitudes of disappointment, grief, and resistance. Japanese secret agents pay the closest attention to their actions. When they enter the country, they are already secretly monitored. As soon as you have any expression similar to propaganda, it is immediately reported to the police station, who will charge them with a crime called "thought crime" and arrest them. Imprisonment for three months, five months, or even three years or two years is indefinite. This situation has long been unbearable for Korean students. Secondly, relatively subservient students, although they can be free, find it difficult to make a living. The Japanese are wary of them rebelling or starting a revolution, so they bury their talents. There was an industrialist who returned from Germany who could not find a job. The government directed him to work as a proofreader in a Japanese printing factory, with a monthly salary of twenty yuan. He reluctantly worked for three months but couldn't stand it and went abroad to make a living. Therefore, Korean students, once they go abroad, do not want to return home to live a hellish life again.</p>
<p>The highest administrative organ in Korea is the Governor-General's Office. Its organization is as follows: under the Governor-General is the Director-General of Political Affairs. Within the office are six bureaus: Finance, Legal Affairs, Academic Affairs, Police Affairs, Internal Affairs, and Colonial Industries; two departments: Agriculture and Forestry, and Land Improvement. In addition, three independent bureaus, namely Postal Service, Railways, and Monopoly, are also directly under the Governor-General. The officials in the Governor-General's Office are entirely Japanese. The whole territory is divided into thirteen provinces: Gyeonggi Province, North Chungcheong Province, South Chungcheong Province, North Jeolla Province, South Jeolla Province, North Gyeongsang Province, South Gyeongsang Province, Hwanghae Province, South Pyongan Province, North Pyongan Province, Gangwon Province, North Hamgyong Province, and South Hamgyong Province. Only one-third of the provincial governors of these thirteen provinces are Koreans, and they are all pro-Japanese figures. The real power in the provincial offices, in terms of police affairs, finance, and internal affairs, is entirely in the hands of the Japanese. They originally just put a high hat on the Koreans to win over the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>The Central Council is the highest advisory body in Korea, with only the right to advise and speak, but no right to vote. This year, the Japanese government ordered the Governor-General's Office to prepare for the initial stage of local autonomy and to organize provincial councils, municipal councils, county councils, and island councils. The chairman of the council can also serve as a local official. From April 1st, a grand election was carried out throughout the territory. In Seoul, cloth signs of candidate council members could be seen everywhere, standing at intersections. Most of them are Japanese. The qualifications for this election are based on property. As a result, Koreans only occupy six percent of the positions, and the power of the council is still controlled by the Japanese. Although revolutionary patriots loudly chant slogans of "national self-determination" and "Korean independence" (this is a secret activity of Koreans, which can be seen in publications, but cannot be shouted in public), it is still a pipe dream.</p>

<p>"Look; what do you think?"</p>
<p>"Shall we go to the station to pick her up?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"What's the point of dressing up like a clay idol and sitting at home?"</p>
<p>"There isn't even a full-length mirror in my house, otherwise I could see myself,"</p>
<p>After she said this, she went downstairs. Ziliang heard the sound of the door opening and knew that she must have gone outside to greet her. Ziliang anticipated that Ms. Ye Yunyu would arrive and knew that if the two of them started arguing, he wouldn't be able to write anything today, so he was trembling with fear, as if a great disaster was about to befall him. He wanted to quickly correct a few composition books before she arrived, but his heart was pounding, and he couldn't use his brain at all.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of laughter came from the alley. Ye Yunyu had arrived. The two of them were in the living room, making a lot of noise. First, they scolded the rickshaw puller, and then Yue Ru told the nanny to buy noodles. Yunyu didn't allow the nanny to go. The three of them made a fuss for a while.</p>
<p>"You haven't eaten, you must be hungry."</p>
<p>This was the voice of the madam.</p>
<p>"I'm not hungry! I had a ham sandwich and a glass of milk on the train, how can I eat anything else?"</p>
<p>The lady, it seemed, had a good throat and her voice was still very loud.</p>
<p>But unable to disappoint the host's good intentions, the nanny went to buy noodles after all. After a while, the laughter started again. Ziliang listened carefully and realized that the lady had brought a pair of pressed ducks as a gift for the madam. The madam and she pushed them back and forth, refusing to accept them. After pushing for a while, the madam probably was afraid of dirtying her clothes, so she stopped pushing.</p>
<p>After finishing the noodles, they chatted for a few words. Suddenly, there was a sound on the stairs. Ziliang hurriedly closed the door of the garret gently. Oh no, the two of them came upstairs, but they didn't come to the garret to disturb Ziliang. They went to the front room. Ziliang knew that this was a courtesy that women always paid when visiting someone's home.</p>
<p>While Ms. Ye was relieving herself, suddenly Yue Ru pushed the door open and said softly to Ziliang:</p>
<p>"Why are you hiding here? A guest has come, you should go out and entertain them."</p>
<p>"I don't have time today!"</p>
<p>"She even asked about you, can you imagine how embarrassing it was for me? I had to say that you were feeling a little unwell today."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 11th, the silver market was relatively peaceful, with a slight upward trend. Although the market was calm, there were still fluctuations of more than seven taels, hovering around 730 taels. In the end, it rose again by three taels, leaving people feeling uneasy. The trend was stable, and the silver market did rise, and the situation softened. However, the US willingness to sell was still present, and US stocks had also rebounded. Undeterred by this, the price of silver opened high, contrary to expectations, and supply and demand among traders was quite different. There was a slight fluctuation in foreign exchange. Subsequently, the price of silver fluctuated by two or three taels. Finally, it was outside 30 taels. This morning, large bars may turn lower. The market will be closed on Saturday, as usual. Remembering that in the middle of this week, the market rebounded sharply, with the lowest price on Monday being 698 taels and 5 mace, and rising to 742 taels on Thursday, a difference of 43 taels and 5 mace. Overall, it rose by 26 taels. The details of yesterday's market are recorded below.</p>

<p>From the opening of the market at 8:00 AM, it rose by 6 taels and 8 mace, reaching 733 taels and a half. Large bars rebounded by 3/16, and the price of silver rose by only 1/8. Private telegrams added 3/16, and the European market was sluggish, so it was inversely proportional. There were also many buyers in the market. Yuan Maoyong, Fuyu, and Zhifengyong were the first to buy in, adding 2 taels to 35 taels and 5 mace. Subsequently, Tong Taichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Qian Changxiang, and others all sold, and the price immediately declined, falling sharply by 4 taels. However, there was a fluctuation of one tael in a moment, reaching 31 taels and 5 mace at 9:15. The initial settlement price of English gold was 4375, followed by 4375 to half a penny. Later, Dadecheng and others bought in, and the English gold was still settled at 4375, so it rose by two or three taels again. The exchange rate listing was not changed, and it was 34 taels and 5 mace. Then, the Huashang Bank sold 4375 to half a penny for September and October, and Yongfeng, Tong Taichang, Wanxing, Hengyu, and others had all sold out, and it immediately fell by 2 taels and 67 mace, reaching 31 taels and 8 mace at 9:50. Retail investors bought in, and then added one tael.</p>

At 11:30, it suddenly fell to 28 taels. There were quite a few sellers on the table, but the quantity was very small. In a moment, it was learned that the Indian exchange rate had decreased by 2 annas, and it immediately rose by three taels, reaching 31 taels and 3 mace at 11:50. It was really because people's hearts were floating and unstable. Subsequently, it was heard that English gold could be settled at 13.5, and it was immediately suppressed to 28 taels and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Raised by Two Taels After Closing <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>

<p>The spot red bar is calculated to add 11 taels and a half. There are not many transactions. The buying and selling of each firm on the table has no large volume. According to statistics, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Wanxing, and Yuan Maoyong generally have more demand than supply. Qian Changxiang sold early and bought back later.

<p>Bank Transactions Not Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the English and American silver markets both rebounded, and the exchange rate also rose, but the Shanghai market did not move. The European market was obviously strong and secretly weak, especially the United States still had silver to sell, so HSBC's listing only reduced 0.125 for Hong Kong, calculated as 80 taels and 0.125, and the rest did not move. The domestic market seemed to be slightly tighter, but there was no excessive change. At noon, the closing price was reduced by 0.0625 for both English and American exchanges compared to the previous day, and the Japanese gold added one point. The silver market tended to be higher, and it had already broken through 30 taels. People's hearts turned upwards, and the actual trading of each exchange was not very prosperous. It is estimated that about 200,000 pounds of English gold were traded, and the Chinese businessmen were all settling to hedge against the previous short positions, and arbitraging gold. There was little activity in American gold, and only the Dalian gang slightly sold Japanese gold. There was no market in the afternoon because it was Saturday.</p>

<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the falling trend has not stopped. Although the overseas flower yarn situation is stable, the local market is still depressed, and the situation is very weak. This is because a certain manufacturer's selling has not stopped, the market is suppressed, and the sales of 10-count coarse yarn are stagnant. However, although the business of 16-count and 20-count yarn in the market is not very prosperous, sporadic transactions continue. It is difficult to predict the future situation.</p>

<p>At the opening of the Manpower Standard market in the exchange, the American cotton was average, and the atmosphere in the market was bad. Each month fell slightly by 0.4 or 0.5 qian. In the afternoon, due to a certain factory throwing out large batches, the market's falling trend rose even more, with each falling by 1 liang, 1 qian to 0.5 or 0.9 qian. The volume of transactions was 19,150 bales. It was found that Changji sold 900 bales, Changfeng 900 bales, Shenda 650 bales, Xincheng 1,150 bales, and Yuantai 550 bales. Shenchang bought 650 bales, Daji 450 bales, Yongfeng 600 bales, and Dafu 400 bales. The closing prices of Manpower Standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Cotton Market Sentiment Weak <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, and old cotton is even weaker, and the falling trend is even more severe. This is because there are fewer buyers, and each factory has no intention of buying. Therefore, the falling trend is more intense than that of new flowers. A part of it is due to the poor condition of American cotton, and the idea of shorting is very strong. However, long positions consider the far-term combined price of foreign cotton to be high, and recently there has been a risk of excessive rainfall in various places, so new short positions are not yet very active.</p>

<h3 id="e264">Sharp Decline in US Cotton Last Week <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Government Report Favors Short Positions</p>
<p>Difficult to Increase World Consumption Next Season</p>
<p>A dispatch from New York on the 10th reports on the cotton market for the week, stating that after a brief surge in buying sparked by an agreement on the debt crisis issue, the cotton market softened and then sharply declined. This was because the government cotton field report favored short positions, and the new cotton crop's progress was also satisfactory. The eastern, central, and western parts of the cotton belt have all received ample rainfall, and the current temperature is also at its highest. It is generally expected that world consumption of US cotton next season will not exceed 12.25 million bales. Therefore, it is widely believed that favorable weather will lead to a bountiful cotton harvest. However, some also believe that the new cotton crop has entered a critical period, and many experts speculate that after the details of the debt deal are finalized, world commerce will improve, which may also increase global estimates for US cotton consumption.</p>

<p>Yesterday, about a dozen rice boats from Changshu and Xianzi arrived. The local market initially appeared sluggish but then became active. The price of premium Su-Chang japonica rice fluctuated slightly throughout the market. The opening prices for medium and lower grades remained fixed. The prices of Qingjiao, Shipu, and Chonggu thin rice all uniformly increased, and buying interest was not weak. Luyang Jian and Bu Jian rice saw no price changes. Out-of-town sales were slightly active, and retail inquiries also increased slightly. Large transactions were quite stable. Glutinous rice for wine production remained unchanged, indicating a downstream trend.</p>
<h3 id="e267">South Market <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, supplies from various regions remained limited. Retail sales in the city and countryside were notably brisk. Intermediate-grade stored goods seemed sluggish, and prices also reflected this. Select fresh rice saw a slight increase, because of the unfavorable weather and stable sentiment, the price of premium japonica rice once increased, causing the price to rise by half a chi (unit of length). Thin rice arrivals were slightly up, but customers found it difficult to sell, and local sales were also thin, causing the market price to fall by one chi. Imported Du Jian rice was active and saw a strong increase, while medium rice was flat, and prices remained fixed. Early rice from the South Port had good absorption, causing prices to rise. While the outbound sales of imported rice were thin and insufficient for local sales, because of the lack of subsequent arrivals, suppliers held firm, and the market became tight.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Flour Market Fluctuations Also Depend on Gold Prices <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of fluctuating fatigue. Because the price of foreign wheat and silver rose by another three to five jiao (monetary unit), the market sentiment for various months once weakened. However, because gold prices stabilized, sentiment became somewhat stable. As the market had very little in the way of changes, transactions were not very active either. Generally speaking, the future gold price and the flour market are expected to have a significant relationship. Because the price of foreign wheat continues to decline, there has been no turnaround. If the exchange rate rises again, orders will definitely be smooth, and the market situation will definitely have a major shift. As a result, this month was unchanged, August was down 0.025, September was down 0.075, October was down 0.1, November was down 0.025, and December was down 0.05.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Main Reason for the Weakening Trend in the Wheat Futures Market <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Accumulation of Wheat… Factory Operations Not Smooth</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Quotes… Frequently Lowered</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market generally showed a flat and sluggish trend. Because foreign wheat quotes continued to fall by another three to five jiao (monetary unit), it is clear that the foreign market situation is not good. In addition, new wheat spot goods have not been smoothly handled by the Shen factories, and the accumulation of goods is a standard cause for concern about the future. Therefore, the opening prices for various months continued to see a weakening. This month's lowest price was once 3 taels and 6 qian and 8 fen (monetary units). However, because the gold market was able to hold steady, it slightly recovered. As a result, this month was down 0.02 from the previous day, August was down 0.01, September was down 0.02, October was down 0.03, November was down 0.01, and December was down 0.04. Spot wheat was flat, with 2,500 packages of wheat from Kaisuangfeng, Zhitang, Caishi, Anting, Pudong, Penglai, Waigang, Baihegang, and Hezhou handled by Huafengxiangxing.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Sugar Market: 500 Bags of Russian Coarse Grain White Sugar Initially Opened <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Rescheduled Sugar Prices Recover</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to dispatches from the sugar production area, the current price of Cuban sugar remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for September rose 0.04 compared to the previous telegram, and other months also rose by 0.03 each. The Java sugar current futures remained unchanged. There were very few scheduled transactions in the public market. However, shipments rebounded, and market sentiment recovered. The transaction price for Dutch No. 24 coarse grain white sugar, foreign firm goods, reached 10 taels, 0 qian, and 7.5 fen (monetary units). Buyers still felt active, and sellers set the price at 10 taels, 0 qian, and 8 fen, but there were few takers, and the market was strong. Japanese N-mark sugar was at 10 taels, 0 qian, and 7.5 fen, YT-mark sugar was at 10 taels, 0 qian, and 7 fen, YP-mark sugar was at 11 taels, 0 qian, and 5 fen, TM-mark sugar was at 10 taels, 0 qian, and 6.5 fen, J-mark sugar was at 11 taels and 1 qian, and YRO-mark sugar was at 10 taels, 0 qian, and 5 fen. The market was also firm and stable. Taikoo B-mark sugar was scheduled at 11 taels and 1 qian and was also quite popular. Tianxiang Foreign Firm sold 500 bags of Russian coarse grain white sugar at a price of 10 taels and 0 qian and 1 fen (monetary units), new and old rules, which was very popular. This is the first batch of Russian sugar shipped to Shanghai to be opened. Subsequent batches are expected to continue arriving.</p>
<h3 id="e271">North-South Goods: Prices of New Lan Bamboo Shoots Soar <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>The local market price of new Lan bamboo shoots was initially set at only 36 yuan, but then, because the Shanghai firm directly sent people to Zhangzhou to purchase the shoots, the price soared. Unexpectedly, it has recently risen even higher. It initially rose from 36 yuan to 45 or 46 yuan, and yesterday, according to a dispatch from Zhangzhou, it has reached 56 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. This is not a good sign for the future. Although the output in various places is scarce this year, it is also necessary to consider the strength of the purchasing power of the sales side before determining the height of the price. Unilateral price increases will hinder future sales, which is not appropriate. The majority of the sales market for this product is in Zhejiang Province. The silkworm news from various sales areas is quite bad this year, so the sales of Lan bamboo shoots will inevitably decrease. Excessively high prices are even more inappropriate. Those in the industry should take precautions to avoid unexpected losses.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local Shanghai foreign firm silk market was even more sluggish. American sales remained unchanged, and factory managers received no response to their telegrams. Current silk sales in England and France are sparse, and market sentiment is depressed. Yesterday, only 10 bales of white factory silk from Lianna and 10 bales of yellow coarse silk from Samsung were imported, and prices were flat and sluggish.</p>

<p>The new summer cocoons from Hangzhou and Shaoxing have been on the market for more than a week. This year's summer silkworms, the early batches, were completely abandoned due to weather damage. The late batches were also not good, and cocoon production was still poor, averaging only 20-30% of normal years. The cocoon collection of cocoon firms in various regions was scarce, and the cocoon market has ended one after another. The highest price for improved superior cocoons required 60+ yuan, while the lowest price for local cocoons was 42 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local Shanghai foreign firm tea market saw Luxiang Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other regions, handled by Baochang, Tianyu, Xiehe, Jinlong, and other firms. The price of bud-picked goods opened at around 200 taels, and the price of ordinary goods opened at 140-150 taels. The market situation was not quiet. Needle eyebrow and show eyebrow goods also had some sales to French firms, but sales were not strong, and the market price was 2-3 taels lower. There were no large transactions for other goods such as Gongxi pearl tea.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Hardware: Military Factories Purchase Hardware Products <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's hardware transactions saw no major activity from customers or factories. The market situation was quiet. However, the business of the Nanjing Military Factory stood out and added a lot of color to the entire market. For example, 700-800 dan (unit of weight) of blue lead, 20 tons of red copper, 10 tons of white lead, 200 bundles of three-sheet black iron sheets, 15 barrels of white lead sheets, and other transactions such as tinplate, new lead wire, I-beams, and British steel plates were also significant. Prices remained unchanged compared to the market. It is said that the Hanyang Military Factory has also been quoting prices recently, and future transactions are also expected to be substantial.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Some People Maintain the Hardware Market <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the hardware market has seen very few actual transactions due to telegram orders. However, after the prices were raised initially, they suffered a setback. The prices of tinplate, British and American flat white iron, new lead wire, flue iron, angle iron, tin, blue lead, and British steel plates have all frequently declined. Because the industry is aware of this, everyone wants to find a way to maintain prices. Therefore, yesterday, companies with ample financial resources all had the intention of maintaining prices, so the market may gradually improve in the future.</p>
