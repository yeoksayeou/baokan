<p>國外要電</p>
<p>美總統提議成敗繫於法比</p>
<p>法政府準備提出對案</p>
<p>要求保留無條件賠欵</p>
<p>比利時預算頓失平衡</p>
<p>對胡佛計畫同持異見</p>
<h3>路透社二十三日倫敦電</h3>
<p>昨日世界視綫集於華盛頓與柏林丶今日則移注於巴黎丶蓋胡佛總統保全德國之谋丶成敗繫於巴黎之行動也丶倫敦人士公認如法國接受停付戰債賠欵之議丶則犧牲最大者丶首爲美丶次爲法丶今晨英報皆懸測法政府之答語丶法國政界似以胡佛總統先未商諸法國丶遽即發表其議爲憾丶實則此事焦點丶厥爲法國犧牲楊格計畫下無條件的每年二千萬鎊賠欵之問題丶此欵供法國戰災區域復興經費丶依照楊格計畫丶德國無權展綏繳付也丶英報一般議論丶以爲法國决不致始終拒絶胡佛總統提議丶但將提出答案丶目的在一方面保留所謂無條件的賠欵丶一方面仍使德國得渡其難關丶</p>
<h3>路透社二十二日華盛頓電</h3>
<p>負責方面聲稱胡佛總統停付戰債一年之提議丶包括德國每年所付之無條件賠欵在内云丶今日國務卿史汀生稱丶如胡佛總統之提議丶須付諸實施丶而發生所需要之效力丶則國際會議實不成問題丶因急需者丶厥爲德國債權國之迅速接受此提議耳云丶</p>
<h3>國民社二十三日巴黎電</h3>
<p>據可靠消息丶法國現正準備一對案丶將折衷於美總統計劃與法國原來要求（即無條件賠欵照常繳付）之間丶惟今日法官廳宣稱丶胡佛總統計劃丶於恢復商業信用上巳大著成效丶法政府縱有對案丶定不拒絶丶美總統之提議今日法内閣特召集閣議丶以期决丶定對於此項提議之態度丶</p>
<h3>國民社二十二日華盛頓電</h3>
<p>此間巳有若干徵象丶表示外交與財政上壓力丶可以强迫法國接受胡佛總統計劃丶當美政府接到法國正考慮提出對案消息後丶財政次長米爾士即以法國應還戰債數目單丶於今夜授法大使署財政參贊丶表示倘法政府拒絶美總統計劃丶則他國將享停付利益丶而法國仍須照付對美對英等戰債丶據官廳意見丶法國縱可單獨行動丶將大損法國信用丶喪失國外貿易丶實屬得不償失丶故料法國將終接受美國計劃也丶照胡佛總統計劃丶美國將緩付三萬四千六百萬金元丶德國可緩付四萬二千七百萬金元丶法國將犧牲九千六百七十五萬金元丶英國將犧牲二千零七十七萬一千金元丶其問英法犧牲數目丶即係應收賠欵與還戰債之差額丶</p>
<h3>國民社二十三日巴黎電</h3>
<p>法報不分黨派丶對胡佛總統提議論調幾出一轍丶吾人於此不難預揣法政府之態度丶如左派之勞工報與保守派之巴黎廻聲報丶竟同主張法政府當提出對案丶提議應准德國比楊格計劃規定範圍更變之停止付欵丶照此辦法丶德國仍須用馬克續付無條件賠欵丶由國際銀行存儲丶俟達六萬二千萬馬克時丶乃貸與德國實業界丶但德國須保證於胡佛總統提議之一年停付期滿後丶不復立即換用楊格計劃之停付權利丶</p>
<h3>國民社二十三日不魯塞爾電</h3>
<p>據今日發表之半官性質談話丶比政府對美總統提議丶將與法國採同一態度丶因此國所收賠欵數額丶遠過於所付戰債丶設接受美國計劃之現在方式丶財政上蒙重大損失丶勢將無法維持預算之平衡丶再馬克票協定與楊格計劃截然爲二事丶亦不應在緩付之列丶</p>
<p>英國表示願與美合作</p>
<h3>路透社二十二日倫敦電</h3>
<p>英相麥唐納答保守黨領袖包爾温之問丶謂英政府甚歡迎胡佛總統停付戰債一年之驚人宣言丶政府願立即聲明一心贊同此宣言之原則丶並準備合作籌議細則丶以期此原則早收實際上效果云丶包爾温與自由黨領袖喬治前後發言丶皆贊成麥唐納對於此事之態度丶美總統建議宣佈後丶情勢一新丶下月英外相漢德森之游巴黎丶將更形重要丶英外相擬於七月十五十六兩日留於巴黎丶乘此機會與法政府討論此事丶十六夜赴柏林丶與英相麥唐納同游德國丶應德總理與外長之請也丶</p>
<p>德企望修改楊格計劃</p>
<h3>國民社二十二日柏林電</h3>
<p>德國務總理白魯寗今日向美報通訊員表示丶胡佛總統緩付賠欵一年之計劃丶於德國納稅人及失業者仍不能有立時救濟之效丶（按楊格計劃規定丶倘德國緩付賠欵丶第一年仍須照數繳存國際銀行丶僅該銀行不轉解各國而用諸德國生利事業耳丶）故德國必須繼續修改楊格計劃丶至關於戰債與賠欵問題之國際會議丶現雖無立時召集之必要丶將來終須召集云丶據德國國權黨報紙言丶停付債欵一事丶是以灰法國驅策全歐之雄心丶而取消其因藏金而發生之優越地位丶自由黨日曼尼亞報之態度雖較緩和丶但亦謂法國或將用他種方法丶阻止德國之發展云丶柏林日報則希望法國之政治家如白里安等丶能在緊急時期運用其情淅之思想丶以應付環境之趨勢丶至社會民主黨報紙亦表示願法國勿過事阻礙歐州各邦之康健復元丶而其餘各報不信任法國之能合理行動者丶亦不在少數丶</p>
<p>意附條件接受美提案</p>
<h3>國民社二十二日羅馬電</h3>
<p>意政府今日正式宣稱丶接受美總統計劃丶但須以德國不再進行德奥關稅聯盟爲條件丶謂意政府願即犧牲所得賠欵與所還戰債間差額一萬八千萬吕耳丶以期增進國際間休戚相關之睦誼丶協助軍縮大會籌備之進行丶按德奥稅約問題丶雖在國際法庭審查之中丶但德國迄未放棄進行之决心丶現德旣始終竭力反對丶意又有此種附帶條件丶故此間人士多料在美總統提議實行以前丶尚恐有一番國際間嚴重爭執也丶</p>
<h3>國民社二十二日羅馬電</h3>
<p>聞墨索里尼不久即將與美國國務卿史汀生晤見丶史氏將於七月五日抵内泊爾斯丶登陸後即將驅車入意國京城丶以與首相及外相格蘭第等晤談丶至意國對於美國停付債欵之計劃丶完全贊同丶大約墨格二氏於與史汀生握手時丶將面致對於胡佛總統欽仰之意丶</p>
<p>日本態度表面示贊同</p>
<h3>電通社二十三日東京電</h3>
<p>德大使本日午後至日外務省丶詢問緩付賠欵問題丶永并次官告以緩付賠欵問題丶本日閣議未曾决定丶倘關於賠欵協定丶各關係國應表示態度時丶或將加贊成丶以謀國際經濟安定丶惟目下尚未能明白表示態度云云丶</p>
<h3>路透社二十二日東京電</h3>
<p>各大報均有社論批評美總統停付戰債一年之建議丶一致表示歡迎丶並信此舉大有助於解除目下全世界之困厄丶許多報紙多乘此機會請美國更進一步丶提議减少戰債與賠欵丶時事新聞深信美總統之建議丶如爲各國接受丶則可須利明年軍縮大會之國際合作丶</p>
<p>國際銀會露一線曙光</p>
<h3>國民社二十三日東京電</h3>
<p>美總統提議緩付戰債之舉丶結果或可成就國際銀會議之召集丶因美國當初不願召集此會丶爲憚於討論戰債丶故今戰債旣停付丶銀會議前途巳减少一重阻力丶設再努力進行丶當可望其成功丶</p>
<h3>路透社二十二日華盛頓電</h3>
<p>參議員史摩特不久將與美總統商量救濟銀巿之方法丶史氏刻在華盛頓丶蓋因戰債停付丶應總統之請而來也丶同來者有烏泰銀礦職員四人丶史雖希望舉行非正式國際銀會議丶但今日表示不必堅持此議丶因渠與總統晤商時丶或可籌出新辦法也云丶</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>一萬六千八百四十種的職業</p>
<p>吾們中國人的大小職業俗有三百六十行之說。其實細細的統計起來。恐怕還不止此數。至於在他們西洋各國無論甚麽事情。都在不斷的翻新花樣。因此職業也就特别的多了。單以英國而論。據說就有一萬六千八百四十種之多。在這許多職業中間·很有幾個奇怪的名稱。如「粉猴」。“PowderMonkey"「怪人」“Bogey　Mao”「女郎」"Spout　Gifl"等。吾們單看了這些名稱。竟不知道是那麽一回事。此外如「巷女」“Alley　Girl”是指肥皂廠中在肥皂製成打好圖印後擔任審查職務的女子。稱爲巷女。不知何所取義。又如「山明治人」“Sandwich　Man"那是指街頭一般掮廣告牌的人。他們在身前身後掛着兩塊廣告牌。身體夾在中間。正如一塊山明治（夾肉的麵包）啊。</p>
<p>影戲中的軍艦保險</p>
<p>英國有一家偉大的影戲公司。去年拍一部偉大的海軍影片。爲像真起見。特向政府告借軍艦十艘。并請艦中的水兵們加入表演。政府准許他們的請求丶但是要他們將全部軍艦保險二千萬金鎊。以防萬一。</p>

<p>臺灣僻處海陬。遥對閩省。物産豐富。尤饒糖果。慨自甲午割予日本。成爲吾國外交之奇恥。我人言念及此。能母感慨。老友宋君業糖。繼承父業。在臺數十年。近因不慣帝國主義之壓迫。屏當歸滬。談及該地情况。並番族之俗習。頗多發噱。且尤痛心。兹就記憶所及。錄之以資談助。</p>
<p>臺灣界分前後。後臺多番族。番有生熟之别。開化者謂之熟番。未開化者謂之生番。外界欲交換物品。悉由熟番居間。當滿清光緒間。劉坤一督制臺灣。以後臺地廣物豐。計議生聚。藉熟番之通譯。派勇敢精悍之士多人。赴彼指導墾植。曾撥耕牛萬頭。輔以剷鋤等具。稻麥豆黍種子。諄諄勸勉。詎該番等生性野蠻。誘掖無方。結果。宰牛而食。驅員令出。如是者數度經營。卒不受化。繼加兵力以征。奈山路崎嶇。若輩慣越嶺匿洞。征不奏功。較諸孔明之征南蠻。猶難收效。雖然生番固若是。然熟番之俗性。進化亦匪易易。蓋有一種迎神賽會之陋習。令人聞而發噱。輒於春夏之交。聚一羣男女。赤裸其上體。蓬鬆其亂髮。汚足垢面。狀貌獰猙。下體前僅覆紅綠布裙一幅。上連下分。成旗門形。儼若清兵之戰裙。彳亍於途。露臀於第。排列雙行。百餘人開導。中舁一形似椅式之竹輿。張以紅布若帳幔。内陳人頭一。鮮血淋漓。尤以殺取異鄉者爲朕兆。輿之兩側貫竹槓二。四人分肩各端。行動時衆皆大嚷。不啻狼呼猿啼。輿後隨百餘人。咸持香一柱。最後有頭戴紅頂花翎之帽。身穿黄褂。足蹬烏靴者一人爲殿。謂之押神。此種不倫不類之習俗。僅至崇仰紅頂花翎之化境。以較生番。固判若天淵。即以全臺之民性測之。其腦筋之陳舊。亦較他處爲著。無怪數十年來。一任異族之宰割也。</p>
<p>抑又有一事爲可慨者。臺之對江。爲閩之南港。該地常見木屐兒之足跡。凡爲惡不法之港人。輒入臺籍爲護符。住居之門上。咸貼臺籍之名剌。用以隂抗當道之檢查也。舊友王詠梅曾長警務於彼。旋以辦事掣肘引去。今聞宋君之言。益可信巳。</p>
<h3>馬陳巧遇</h3>
<p>— 晚成</p>
<p>著名學者馬君武陳柱尊兩氏。布衣蔬食。樸儉風。陳氏因長公子一百兄在美留學。費用浩繁。交大大夏兩大學敎薪所入。勉强維持。陳氏近來生活。格外儉樸。上月某日乘三等電車至徐家匯交大授課。適馬君武氏亦上三等電車。陳見馬喊曰。「你也來了。」乃互談衷曲片刻。并各道「寒酸」近况云。</p>
<h3>一飯之訓</h3>
<p>— 斅厂</p>
<p>一昨友人孫君錦芳。述一少年立品事。有足紀者。爰轉錄於此。</p>
<p>諸曁北鄉。有凌某者。富家子也。當其在舞象之年。因父母愛而不敎。致罔識世</p>
<p>故人情。且任意妄爲。傲慢無禮。乃父非不明事理者。祇以其子驕養巳慣。非家敎所能補救。以是擬令其子出外肄業。藉學商規。嗣由杭友陸某。薦至杭垣某銀號學業。當凌入店之日。身御華服。由距銀號二里許之介紹人陸某家乘輿到店。到店後。拜該號經理吳朗齋君爲師。吳一見凌。意即不懌。蓋學徒進店。從未有若是之闊綽者。凌旣進店。移時即就午餐。與乃師同桌。而佐膳之肴。係三素一葷。凌爲富家子。每餐非葷不啖。因此一飯在口。即首先下箸葷碗中。乃師見而怒甚。當訓之曰。此係葷肴。須全桌之人。一一下箸後。汝方可食。此乃小學徒就餐之規矩也。凌經此打擊。急縮轉其箸。而鉗素肴。並一盂飯盡。即罷其食。巳而衆皆餐畢。凌遂謂其師曰。先生。予欲歸去矣。吳訝然曰。出外學業。須三年學滿。方可返里一行。今汝來此。僅數小時。何故即欲歸也。凌曰。予之所以來此學業者。非爲將來謀生計。乃藉以學習規矩耳。頃承先生一飯之訓。乃知爲人固在在有禮也。蓋就餐細事。尚須如是。其他更無論矣。但予因受先生一飯之訓。而巳悟一切爲人之道。故不必再留於此。雖然。予甚感先生。且予追隨先生。雖僅數時而即别去。然一日爲師。終身爲徒之諺。自當永誌勿忘也。乃師聞言。不知所答。乃命人招介紹人陸某至。凌對陸言。亦如上述。陸再四勸留。凌堅不允。吳陸二人見其意志堅定。語言懇摯。遂許之。於是凌即歸去。</p>
<p>不料凌自歸家後。即循規蹈矩。一反從前之品性。於是父母喜之。閭閻稱之。凌常語人曰。予之得以如是者。皆吾師吳朗齋先生之所賜也。聞凌自休業返里後。對於乃師。除時時致函問候。及餽贈禮品外。年必躬自到杭探望一次。凌現年四十有五。賢名播鄉里。予友孫君。與凌爲同里。故知之甚詳。</p>
<h3>畫展珍聞</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>海上名畫家孫雪泥君。提倡團扇。乃邀集寓滬各畫家商笙伯馬企周謝公展賀天健熊松泉王師子馬孟容等。五十餘人。各畫山水花鳥人物。約計一千四百餘張。假寗波同鄉會開團扇展覽會。聞風加入者如李秋君陸小曼高十雲楊雪玖女士。小蝶劍知兩詞人。亦以絶精之作品陳列會中。王一亭沈心海葉渭莘高尚之等。亦於第二日寄來扇件。蔗根老人。恐被他人捷足先得。一宵不睡。天甫明即候於同鄉會門首。七時啓門。即登樓揀選精品廿四把。正在選擇。王師子與謝公展均趕到。一見蔗根所定之扇。撫掌大笑曰。不圖君之着先鞭也。其風趣有如是。</p>
<p>秋君女士親送扇來。寗波同鄉之尾於後者。凡數十人之多。剛在展閱。定畫者互相爭奪。各不相讓。甚矣身價之尊也。小曼女士之畫。及小蝶與十雲之畫扇共六七把。各畫家爭奪一空。後至者咸呼負負。</p>
<p>詞壇泰斗兼巢老人七十大慶。國府于院長右任。爲定畫扇三百反。以備分贈祝嘏者。</p>
<p>笙伯企周天健公展午昌師子松泉雪泥渭莘之畫扇。竟有三四人爭購而起喧鬧者。後經雪泥排解。各定一扇而爭始罷。六月初旬汪仲山張聿光徐曉村高尚之等十三人。發起扇面展覽會。聞風來購者尤衆。竟有一扇而照樣定畫者六七人。三日間共售得洋二千餘元。</p>
<p>十三日起由趙半跛吳子鼎馬萬里三人。開畫展會於同鄉會。不佞亦往參觀。半跛之畫定價一例十五元。均由潘老蘭張冷僧高振霄題詩。頗爲一般人所推重。記得潘題桃花一幀云。雙槳乘潮落日斜。小桃門巷阿誰家。喚來根葉名都艶。一樹銷魂况是花。風韵絶佳。與半跛之畫筆淡逸。可稱雙絶。英領事沛君見而欣賞。定購四幅。吳畫絶似小某曉樓。定者尤衆。萬里所繪荷花一巨幅。純摹撝叔。青出於藍。梁公約題一絶云。莫愁湖畔水重天。物倚新秋思惘然。渚閣雨晴微醉後。斷霞殘照自相憐。詩書畫三絶。最爲參觀者所擊賞。定畫者達十餘人。</p>
<h3>書蔡正華先生元劇聯套述例後</h3>
<p>— 雲間亮</p>
<p>我國文學界中作品。最精最細。興味最濃。感人最深。推行最廣。而最有價值者。莫曲劇若。曲劇原於詞。詞源於樂府。然樂府進而爲詞。詞進而爲曲劇。文學進化之公式。顯然之順序也。按元代曲劇。由宋代大曲演變而來。名曰雜劇。有舞有歌。並笙笛琵琶以和其曲。所謂曲者。即雜劇之劇文也。當時名家頗多。而以關王鄭白爲四大家。關似瓊筵醉客。王如花下美人。鄭則玉咳九霄。白乃鵬　天半。此外餘霞散錦。美不勝收。風會所趨。一時稱盛。正華先生所述。大都元代作家。應有盡有擇焉而精。語焉而詳。指示正軌。俾研究曲劇者。無復有　埴索途之歎。有功曲界。豈淺鮮也哉。承學之士。果能因目以溯詞。因詞以究劇。咀嚼商。興高味厚。美感文字。必大進步。可預言也。進而考時諸作家之身世。屈於異族淫威之下。痛蠻横之政府。寫困苦之平民。繚繞筆端。無非抑鬱不平之氣。視班馬騷莊之寄託。何以異哉。且雅俗共賞。今古咸宜。其感化推行之廣狹深淺。儗之固遷原周。爲何如也。矧其結構。有套數。有襯字襯句。其表演也有賓白科譯發端。冲塲收煞之别。於科白中叙事。而曲文全爲代言。方之宋金諸作。實爲進步。描寫入情。有聲有色。其神妙獨到處。竟能令聽者閱者。魂攝於悲歡離合之中。隨劇俯仰。垂涕破顔。而莫由自主。詎非至精至細。難能而可貴也哉。余所以謂曲劇爲文學界中最有價值者也。承約翰大學副校長沈嗣良博士請審查正華碩士之作品。儗給學位。余於評語外。爰綴數語。質之吳瞿安先生以爲何如。中華民國二十年六月十三日陸規亮。</p>
<h3>說部扶輪會</h3>
<h3>？？？</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>潘子良睡到天明的時候，忽然覺得胸口苦悶，宛如身體上壓了百斤左右重的東西，十分難受。他眼睛要想睜開來，但是睡魔還把他纒擾着不放，所以仍舊不能醒。他一味覺得好睡啊！不過胸口的重物，還是壓着。他從半意識中，忽然想起一件事情來，從前聽一位朋友講過一節笑話：有一個老學究，睡到半夜裏，突然在床上喊起救命來了。因爲他自巳覺得好像有人用帶子縛在他頭頸裏，打算縊死他。後來他同床的老婆，聞聲而醒，點火一看，真是笑話！原來他老婆脚上的脚帶，不知什麽緣故？繞到他的節頸裏來了，所以他呼吸急促，以爲是有人要謀死他，喊起救命來咧。此刻子良，糊裏糊塗的暗想：</p>
<p>「我的老婆，是天然足，没有脚帶，當然不會使我不能呼吸，那末，壓在我胸口的，是什麽東西呢？難道伊　相惡劣，睡夢中把腿擱到我身上來麽？那也没有這麽重啊……」</p>
<p>正在這個時候，忽然又覺得自巳鼻子裏一陣奇癢，幾乎要打嚏了。這一來，到底剌激得厲害，硬把濃睡而還没到每天睡醒的時候的潘子良，弄醒了。</p>
<p>子良將宛如有無限斤兩的一雙眼皮，用力睜開來，剛一睜，還没睜足，巳經一嚇，原來在離開自巳眼睛不過三四寸的地方，有一個巨大的面孔。子良這一嚇，把自巳從半醒狀態，變到全醒狀態去了；但是在第二瞬間，他就不嚇了。</p>
<p>原來這巨大的面孔，並不是什麽妖魔鬼怪，乃是自巳的夫人月如女士的嬌容。只見伊上半身伏在自巳胸口，怪不得重了。伊右手拿着一根蔴綫，正對着自巳的鼻子管裏送進來，面孔湊得很近，所以覺得大了。伊一見子良醒來，便格格格的笑着，把右手的蔴綫收回去了。</p>

<p>Wu Tiecheng Arrived in Beiping Yesterday</p>
<h3>Beiping</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng and his wife arrived in Beiping this afternoon. Wang Shuhan, Zhang Xueming, Tang Guozhen, and others welcomed them at the station. Wu Tiecheng told reporters that he had gone to Harbin and Shenyang to offer congratulations to Zhang Jinghui on behalf of Chiang and to participate in the third anniversary memorial ceremony for Grand Marshal Zhang. He came to Beiping to check on Deputy Commander Zhang's illness. According to Zhang Xueming and Wang Shuhan, the Deputy Commander had fully recovered from his illness, and his pulse and temperature were the same as those of ordinary people. He went to the hospital to offer his condolences in the afternoon and conveyed Chiang's regards. The Guangdong affair will inevitably tend towards a peaceful resolution, but only the timing is the issue. He did not know about Li Jishen going to Guangdong to mediate. Shi Yusan recently made a sincere statement of obedience to the Deputy Commander, so external rumors are not credible. The police chief matter and organizational regulations have not yet been sent to the Legislative Yuan, so the establishment is not expected to occur soon. Zhang Jinghui is busy with political affairs in the Harbin Special District and will not go to Beijing for the time being. He himself suffers from chronic colds and plans to stay in Beiping to recuperate. Recent rumors are fabricated by bad people, so please do not be misled. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<h3>Telegram from Salaqi</h3>
<p>To the gentlemen of all circles across the country, forwarded by various newspaper offices: The main canal of the Minshēng Canal in Satu, Suiyuan, has been opened. The opening ceremony was held at Dengkou at noon today. The construction of Suiyuan has begun. We would like to describe the construction process to comfort the people of the country. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, Suiyuan experienced a severe drought and the disaster situation was urgent. Pei Ji, when he was the Tutong, and people from all walks of life advocated for work relief, using the additional disaster relief funds from the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway to dig canals using local methods to divert water from the Yellow River for irrigation. However, the project was huge and beyond our capabilities. Pei Ji was then transferred to Hebei. Therefore, we signed a contract with the former Chairman Xu Yongchang and various circles in Suiyuan and the China International Famine Relief Commission. The commission provided half of the loan and was responsible for the construction work, using new methods to start construction on a large scale. In the eighteenth year, Pei Ji was ordered to come to Suiyuan again to work with various circles to promote its completion. The total cost was over one million yuan, including the free transportation of materials on the Ping-Sui Railway. A main canal of 150 li from the canal entrance to Gaojia Yechang was built. The average depth of the canal is more than ten feet and the width is ten feet. Fourteen branch canals are currently under construction, eight of which have been started. The total length of the main and branch canals is more than 800 li. There are four gates and 23 bridges. When the entire canal is completed, it can irrigate 20,000 hectares of land. Suiyuan is cold and the construction work is difficult. In the Tuheqi area, digging the soil revealed water and the mud was ten feet deep, which was one of the most difficult parts of the project. In May of this year, General Fu Zuoyi and Division Commander Wang Jingguo specially dispatched 5,000 soldiers to recruit laborers on a large scale and speed up the work. Soldiers and laborers worked in deep water and frozen mud for more than a month. Hundreds of people became sick and dozens died, but they did not complain and finally completed the project. We held a gate opening ceremony today and invited Chinese and foreign guests to visit and offer their congratulations. Everyone agreed that it was a celebration for the construction of Suiyuan. Suiyuan has thousands of miles of fertile land and crisscrossing rivers. In addition to the Minshēng Canal, there are many water conservancy projects that can be developed. If we can actively develop them, the future is limitless. We hope that those in the national economic circles who are interested in developing the Northwest will come to Suiyuan to investigate and jointly plan to protect the Northwest for the country. It will not only benefit the people of Suiyuan. I respectfully submit this telegram for your perusal. Li Peiji (Seal)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Turning Point in the World Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>Any global crisis is the result of a confluence of various factors that happen to converge at one point, leading to an irreconcilable situation. Similarly, a person's illness is also the result of various unhealthy conditions accumulating in different parts before turning into a dangerous and difficult-to-treat disease. When the turning point has not yet arrived, no amount of medicine will have any effect. Once the opportunity for recovery has begun, if one can guide the flow and facilitate the process, the ailments in other parts will gradually resolve themselves. However, if one is not careful in handling the turning point and obstructs the nascent opportunity, the danger of the illness recurring will be even greater. There are many ways to alleviate the current stagnation in the world economy, but none have been effective because the crux of the problem has not been identified, hence the turning point has not been activated. Now, the U.S. President's plan to postpone debt payments for one year has just been announced, and the commercial markets of various countries have immediately shown positive signs. This indicates that the medicine administered has been effective against the illness, hence the inexplicable efficacy. Now that it is known that the U.S. President's plan has an inexplicable effect, it should be continued without any interruption. Even if there are sacrifices due to differing interests between countries, they can only be endured to alleviate the shared illness of the world. This is why the world is paying close attention to France's attitude. The Japanese anticipate that the U.S. may follow up on its proposal to postpone payments by convening a global silver conference. Others expect that the tariff confrontation between Europe and the U.S. and the German-Austrian customs union may also be resolved. If this is the case, the postponement of debt payments will pave the way for resolving other difficult issues, and the potential economic benefits will be immense. Therefore, the immediate task is to collectively ensure the success of the plan and prevent any unforeseen obstacles from causing the nascent turning point to deteriorate and become even more severe.</p>

<h3>Reuters, London, 23rd</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the world's attention was focused on Washington and Berlin; today, it shifts to Paris. The success or failure of President Hoover's plan to safeguard Germany depends on the actions of Paris. Londoners generally believe that if France accepts the suspension of war debts and reparations, the greatest sacrifices will be made by the U.S. first, and France second. This morning, British newspapers speculated on the French government's response, as French political circles seem to regret that President Hoover did not consult France before announcing his proposal. In fact, the focus of this matter is France's sacrifice of the unconditional annual reparations of £20 million under the Young Plan. This fund is used for the reconstruction expenses of French war-torn areas. According to the Young Plan, Germany has no right to postpone payments. British newspapers generally believe that France will not ultimately reject President Hoover's proposal, but will submit a response aimed at preserving the so-called unconditional reparations on the one hand, while still allowing Germany to overcome its difficulties.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Washington, 22nd</h3>
<p>Responsible sources claim that President Hoover's proposal to suspend war debts for one year includes the unconditional reparations paid by Germany each year. Today, Secretary of State Stimson stated that if President Hoover's proposal is to be implemented and have the desired effect, an international conference is not a problem, as the urgent need is for Germany's creditors to quickly accept this proposal.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Paris, 23rd</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, France is currently preparing a counterproposal that will strike a compromise between the U.S. President's plan and France's original demand (i.e., unconditional reparations are paid as usual). However, the French court announced today that President Hoover's plan has had a significant effect on restoring commercial credit, and the French government, even if it has a counterproposal, will not reject President Hoover's proposal. The French cabinet convened a special meeting today to determine its attitude toward this proposal.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Washington, 22nd</h3>
<p>There are already some indications here that diplomatic and financial pressure can force France to accept President Hoover's plan. After the U.S. government received news that France was considering submitting a counterproposal, Under Secretary of the Treasury Mills immediately sent a list of the amount of war debts owed by France to the French Embassy's financial counselor tonight, indicating that if the French government rejects the U.S. President's plan, other countries will enjoy the benefits of suspension, while France will still have to pay war debts to the U.S., the U.K., etc. According to official opinion, even if France can act alone, it will greatly damage France's credit and lose foreign trade, which would be a great loss. Therefore, it is expected that France will eventually accept the U.S. plan. According to President Hoover's plan, the U.S. will postpone the payment of 346 million gold yuan, Germany can postpone the payment of 427 million gold yuan, France will sacrifice 96.75 million gold yuan, and the U.K. will sacrifice 20.771 million gold yuan. The difference between the amounts sacrificed by the U.K. and France is the difference between the reparations receivable and the war debts payable.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Paris, 23rd</h3>
<p>French newspapers, regardless of party affiliation, have almost identical views on President Hoover's proposal. It is not difficult to predict the French government's attitude: newspapers such as the left-wing "Labor News" and the conservative "Paris Echo" both advocate that the French government should submit a counterproposal, suggesting that Germany should be allowed to change the suspension of payments more than the Young Plan stipulated. According to this method, Germany must continue to use marks to pay unconditional reparations, which will be stored in the International Bank. When it reaches 620 million marks, it will be loaned to German industry, but Germany must guarantee that it will not immediately use the suspension rights of the Young Plan after the one-year suspension period of President Hoover's proposal expires.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Brussels, 23rd</h3>
<p>According to semi-official remarks published today, the Belgian government will adopt the same attitude as France towards the U.S. President's proposal, as the amount of reparations received by this country far exceeds the war debts paid. If the current method of accepting the U.S. plan is adopted, it will suffer significant financial losses and will be unable to maintain the balance of the budget. Furthermore, the Mark Agreement and the Young Plan are two completely different things and should not be included in the suspension.</p>
<p>The UK Expresses Willingness to Cooperate with the US</p>
<h3>Reuters, London, 22nd</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald responded to a question from Conservative Party leader Baldwin, saying that the British government warmly welcomes President Hoover's startling announcement to suspend war debts for one year. The government is willing to immediately declare its wholehearted support for the principles of this declaration and is prepared to cooperate in discussing the details in order for this principle to achieve practical results as soon as possible. Baldwin and Liberal Party leader George spoke before and after, all agreeing with MacDonald's attitude towards the matter. The situation has been renewed since President Hoover's suggestion was announced. British Foreign Secretary Henderson's visit to Paris next month will be even more important. The British Foreign Secretary plans to stay in Paris on July 15th and 16th, taking the opportunity to discuss this matter with the French government. On the 16th night, he will go to Berlin and visit Germany with British Prime Minister MacDonald at the invitation of the German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>Germany Hopes to Revise the Young Plan</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd</h3>
<p>German Chancellor Brüning told American newspaper correspondents today that President Hoover's plan to suspend reparations for one year would still not have an immediate relief effect on German taxpayers and the unemployed. (According to the Young Plan, if Germany suspends reparations, it must still deposit the full amount in the International Bank in the first year, but the bank will not transfer it to other countries and will use it for German profitable enterprises.) Therefore, Germany must continue to revise the Young Plan. Although there is no immediate need to convene an international conference on war debts and reparations, it will eventually have to be convened. According to the German National Rights Party newspaper, the suspension of debt payments is to dampen France's ambition to drive all of Europe and to cancel its superior position due to its gold reserves. The attitude of the Free Democratic Party's "Germania" newspaper is more moderate, but it also said that France may use other methods to prevent Germany's development. The "Berliner Tageblatt" hopes that French politicians such as Briand can use their rational thinking in times of emergency to cope with the trend of the environment. Most of the other newspapers do not trust France's ability to act rationally.</p>
<p>Italy Accepts US Proposal with Conditions</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Rome, 22nd</h3>
<p>The Italian government officially announced today that it accepts the U.S. President's plan, but only on the condition that Germany no longer proceed with the German-Austrian customs union, saying that the Italian government is willing to immediately sacrifice the difference of 180 million lire between the reparations received and the war debts repaid in order to enhance the close friendship between nations and assist in the preparations for the disarmament conference. Although the German-Austrian tax treaty issue is under review by the International Court of Justice, Germany has not yet abandoned its determination to proceed. Now that Germany has consistently opposed it and Italy has this attached condition, many people here expect that there will be a serious international dispute before the U.S. President's proposal is implemented.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Rome, 22nd</h3>
<p>It is said that Mussolini will soon meet with U.S. Secretary of State Stimson. Mr. Stimson will arrive in Naples on July 5th, and after landing, he will drive to the Italian capital to meet with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Grandi, etc. Italy fully agrees with the United States' plan to suspend debt payments. It is expected that when Mr. Mussolini shakes hands with Mr. Stimson, he will express his admiration for President Hoover in person.</p>
<p>Japan's Attitude Shows Approval on the Surface</p>
<h3>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd</h3>
<p>The German ambassador visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry this afternoon and inquired about the suspension of reparations. Vice Minister Nagai told him that the cabinet has not yet decided on the suspension of reparations. If the countries concerned should express their attitude regarding the reparations agreement, they may agree to it in order to stabilize the international economy, but they are unable to clearly express their attitude at the moment.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd</h3>
<p>Major newspapers have editorials criticizing the U.S. President's suggestion to suspend war debts for one year, unanimously expressing their welcome and believing that this move will greatly help to relieve the current global difficulties. Many newspapers have taken this opportunity to ask the U.S. to go a step further and propose reducing war debts and reparations. "Jiji Shimpo" believes that if the U.S. President's suggestion is accepted by all countries, it will require international cooperation at next year's disarmament conference.</p>
<p>The International Silver Conference Reveals a Glimmer of Hope</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd</h3>
<p>The U.S. President's proposal to suspend war debts may result in the convening of an international silver conference, as the U.S. was initially unwilling to convene this conference because it was afraid of discussing war debts. Now that war debts have been suspended, an obstacle to the future of the silver conference has been reduced. If we continue to work hard, we can hope for its success.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Washington, 22nd</h3>
<p>Senator Smoot will soon discuss with the U.S. President methods to rescue the silver market. Mr. Smoot is currently in Washington at the President's invitation because of the suspension of war debts. Four officials from the Utah silver mine also came with him. Although Smoot hopes to hold an informal international silver conference, he said today that there is no need to insist on this proposal, as he may be able to come up with a new solution when he meets with the President.</p>

<p>The New York stock market was extremely active today, with 5 million shares traded. Closing prices were firm. The price of each seat on the stock exchange has now increased to $25,000.</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd</h3>
<p>The U.S. President's suspension of debt payments is still the most noteworthy event in the German national opinion. The prices of various securities throughout the country have greatly increased, the first such prosperity since 1914. Deutsche Bank has decided to slightly relax the restrictions on the cashing of promissory notes. The bank no longer needs a loan of 50 million U.S. dollars from a foreign syndicate. All the foreign capital that was previously withdrawn from Germany has gradually returned. It is expected that the outflow of funds will stop within a few days.</p>
<h3>Dentsu News Agency, London, 22nd</h3>
<p>President Hoover's proposal to suspend war debts for one year met with a very favorable reception in the London municipal bond market. Company stocks also rebounded strongly. German government 5.5% bonds rose by £7, 7% bonds rose by £4.5. Oil stocks also dominated, rising £2. Other industrial stocks also followed the rise.</p>

<h3>Xiong Shihui and Cao Haosen Arrive in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Yang Xingfo, Tang Yi, and Other Jiangxi Dignitaries Accompany Them</p>
<p>He Lu Hosts Banquet Welcoming Them, Speaks of the Necessity of Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison and concurrently Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, and Cao Haosen, Vice Minister of Military Affairs and concurrently Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, have returned to Jiangxi with Commander-in-Chief Jiang (Xiong is from Anyi, Cao is from Duchang) to assist in suppressing bandits and handling the aftermath. Xiong and his party departed from Nanjing on the 17th and arrived in Xunyang in the late afternoon of the 18th. Guo Su, the Garrison Commander, Jiang Ji, the Director of the Education Department, and representatives from all sectors of Jiujiang welcomed them at the riverbank. Xiong stayed overnight at the Garrison Headquarters with Guo, while the others did not disembark. Around 7:00 AM on the 20th, Xiong and his party traveled to the provincial capital via the special train provided by the Nanxun Railway. At 11:30 AM, they arrived at Niuxing Railway Station. He Lu, representing the government, and over a thousand welcomers from all sectors greeted them. Xiong and Cao disembarked amidst pouring rain and celebratory military music. Xiong, wearing a light grey serge military uniform, appeared vigorous and walked steadily. He and the welcomers walked to the riverbank, crossed the river by steamer, and transferred to cars to proceed directly to the General Headquarters at Baihuazhou Library to settle in. Accompanying them were Zhou Fohai, Director of the Political Training Department, Yang Yongtai, Counselor of the National Government, the heads of various departments of the General Headquarters, and Jiangxi dignitaries such as Yang Xingfo, Zhou Xiangxian, and Tang Yi. Jiang wished to understand the local conditions of Jiangxi province, so he enlisted their help to gather ideas and efforts. After a brief rest at the General Headquarters, Director He Lu and Chairman Chen visited Xiong and Cao for extensive confidential talks. He hosted a banquet at the General Headquarters that evening to welcome Xiong, Cao, Zhou, and others. Chen, Lu, and other dignitaries in the province attended, and the atmosphere was extremely cordial. The party broke up late into the night. According to Xiong, the Central Government is determined to thoroughly eliminate the Jiangxi bandits and will temporarily ignore the Guangdong issue, hoping for a peaceful resolution in the future. Commander-in-Chief Jiang's arrival in Jiangxi will not end until the Red bandits are suppressed and the military situation has reached a conclusion. Someone asked Cao about the selection of personnel for the Political Affairs Committee and the date of its establishment. He replied that it would be decided after Jiang's arrival. Chairman Lu of the Provincial Government hosted a banquet for Xiong, Cao, Zhou, and senior officers of the General Headquarters tonight. There were heartfelt speeches during the banquet, the main point of which was the need to eliminate the Red menace. Currently, Xiong and Cao are visiting He Lu and military and government officials in the province, such as Commander Chen, Commander Fan, Gao Shuxun, Zhao Guantao, Wei Lihuang, Ruan Zhaochang, and various division commanders. At 4:00 PM this afternoon, they went to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at Yuzhang Park to pay respects to the late Division Commander Hu Zuyu. After reading the eulogy, they wept bitterly over the coffin, showing great sorrow. After the ceremony, they personally visited Hu's residence to express their condolences to his wife and son and offered their sympathy. Cao, having been in military service for a long time, returned to his hometown and was extremely busy with social engagements. He declined them all, focusing on planning military affairs with He Lu at the General Headquarters and consulting with local leaders in the province to contribute after Jiang's arrival. Jiang is expected to depart for Jiangxi today or tomorrow. All members of the provincial party headquarters and provincial government, such as Wang Yinxi, took special trains to Xunyang yesterday. Division Commanders Jiang and Cai also took special trains on the Nanxun Railway to welcome him. Special trains and troop trains on the Nanxun Railway are extremely busy. The preparations for welcoming him in the city are also very enthusiastic. It is also heard that commanders on the front lines, such as Sun Lianzhong and Zhu Shaoliang, will take time to come to the province to participate in the welcome and seek instructions.

<h3>Shang Zhen Returns to Shanxi from Beiping</h3>
<p>The May Salary for the Shanxi Army Has Already Been Received</p>
<p>Xu Yongchang's Illness Has Not Improved; He Has Not Yet Returned to Taiyuan</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Shang Zhen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, has been in Beiping for many days. Recently, due to the need to handle various provincial affairs, he had planned to return to Taiyuan as soon as possible. However, because the May salary allocation that the Deputy Commander's Office should have disbursed was not completely settled, it was repeatedly delayed. It was not until 9:25 PM last night that he took the express train on the Pinghan Railway south, taking the route through Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan. Those who went to the station to see him off last night included Chief of Staff Ji Yiqiao and Huang Luchu, Lu Xianqi, Da Peng, and over ten other dignitaries. Shang said before his departure that the May salary of 1.2 million yuan for the Shanxi army had been received by the Deputy Commander's Office and remitted to Taiyuan in installments. Once he arrives, it can be distributed. This afternoon (the 20th), he went to the Xiehe Hospital to visit Deputy Commander Zhang, but he was asleep, so they did not talk much. Deputy Commander Zhang's condition is very good. He plans to come to Beiping to meet and seek instructions after he recovers. Xu Yongchang's illness has not yet improved. It is not yet known when he can return to Taiyuan. As for whether he will accept a position as a member of the National Government, it was not discussed during the meeting. However, according to Huang Luchu, Xu's illness has largely improved and he should be able to return to Shanxi to serve in two weeks. (Dated the 20th)</p>
<h3>A Train on the Beining Railway Derails in Tanggu</h3>
<p>Caused by Excessive Speed</p>
<p>Tianjin News: Around 11:00 AM yesterday (the 20th), a troop train on the Beining Railway derailed in Tanggu while leaving the station. The cause of the derailment was that the train was eager to proceed and was traveling relatively fast. Furthermore, because it was carrying too little weight, the station procedures were completely in order when it left the station, and all safety signals had been lowered, so the driver confidently proceeded. Unexpectedly, the switch at the station entrance had a slight separation at the point where the rails connected. The train, carrying too little weight, was slightly bumpy and caused the separation to widen. The small wheels at the front of the locomotive derailed, followed by the large wheels at the rear. There were twelve cars behind the locomotive, and the pushing force was very strong, making it impossible to stop, causing the locomotive to derail and move forward several feet. Four of the boxcars directly behind the locomotive also derailed. Fortunately, the ground was sandy, so the wheels of the locomotive sank into the soil and did not overturn. One of the boxcars in the front overturned. Seeing the locomotive derail, several soldiers jumped off the train, resulting in six or seven injuries. The most seriously injured person died after being admitted to the Beining Hospital. The soldiers on the train, fearing that someone had deliberately sabotaged the railway and caused the derailment, temporarily disembarked to take precautions and fired their guns as a warning. The station personnel, fearing for their safety, fled. The station police officers tried to maintain order but were beaten by the soldiers. Later, the stationmaster and local police came forward to mediate. The station provided another locomotive and a freight car to move the undamaged cars back into the station. A temporary detour was built at the site of the derailment and completed at 3:00 PM, allowing the soldiers to continue west. A total of eight rails and over thirty ties were destroyed at the site of the derailment. None of the vehicles were completely destroyed. The total loss was only over two thousand yuan. After the detour was completed, all passenger trains resumed normal operations, but westbound trains were slightly delayed. (Dated the 21st)</p>
<h3>Lu Bandits Flee North to Xintai</h3>
<p>Burning and Killing Villages is Extremely Tragic</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The bandit gang of Guo Maofeng in southern Shandong has fled north to Xintai, harassing Chenjiayu, twenty miles from the city. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, telegraphed Wang Wanqing's troops, the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Shandong Militia, and Tang Yaoxun's Brigade stationed in Qufu, to strictly suppress them. It is now reported that Chenjiayu Mountain Village and its blockhouse have been captured, and over a hundred villagers, male and female, have died. The number of those kidnapped and missing is not yet counted. The bandits, numbering over 1,500, have fled back to Mengshan in one group, and another group has plundered north of Xintai City and occupied Xinpu Mountain. After passing through Ruishan, Huangshangou, and other villages, they carried out large-scale burning and killing. On the 19th, they captured Gao Yaitou and Zhaojiazhuang, and the village leaders were disemboweled and flayed, which was extremely cruel. This group of bandits is still entrenched in the two villages, besieging nearby villages. Every night, they patrol on horseback, attacking people and burning villages. For days, the fires have been raging and corpses litter the roads. The postal route from Taian to Xintai and Mengyin is also blocked. The county seat is surrounded on three sides and in imminent danger. Yesterday (the 21st), representatives from various agencies in the county risked their lives to come to the province and urgently appealed to the provincial government headquarters for help. It is reported that Chairman Han has promised to send troops to suppress them immediately. (Dated the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Stock Exchange's Policy of Aggression Against China</h3>
<p>Zhensheng &amp; Co. Imitates Old Tricks of Dasugi &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Plan to Establish Another Trading Organization</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Stock Exchange had a dispute caused by the loss of credit by the Japanese merchant Zhensheng &amp; Co. After the Exchange's Sino-Japanese committee handled the punishment, it seemed to be over. An investigation revealed that the Exchange has a total of 36,000 shares, of which 18,111 are Chinese shares and 17,889 are Japanese shares. Opium King Liu Zishan alone occupies half of the Chinese shares. According to a businessman, ten years ago, the Japanese company Dasugi &amp; Co., trading in raw oil, had a similar incident to what happened with Zhensheng &amp; Co. After mediation, they were only fined two jiao per hundred jin, totaling a huge sum of 170,000 yuan. The ambition of the Japanese to manipulate the city's commerce is evident. After Dasugi &amp; Co. was fined, it was almost bankrupt. The Japanese committee proposed relief, stipulating that all those trading at the Exchange from then on would have to pay a special fee. For example, oil would have a fee of one yuan and two jiao per hundred jin, later increased from one yuan and two jiao to two yuan and four jiao. Other goods were also subject to fees. The revenue from this special fee was used to compensate for the losses of Dasugi &amp; Co. Over the past ten years, the fine of 170,000 yuan has only been reduced by a few thousand yuan, and it will be fully paid off this year. This alone shows that the Japanese policy of aggression against Qingdao's commerce is truly frightening. This time, Zhensheng &amp; Co. imitated the old tricks of Dasugi &amp; Co., hoping to manipulate the native product merchants to achieve its monopoly plan. Even if it fails, it can still rely on the Exchange's special income to compensate for its losses. The Japanese plan is indeed cunning. It is reported that the Sino-Japanese committee met on the 18th and decided on the punishment: the first transaction would be punished at 3%, totaling 5,544 yuan; the second would be punished at 300 yuan per hundred tons, totaling 2,850 yuan; and it was also decided that if such breaches of contract occur again in the future, they would be handled by fining one yuan per hundred yuan. The Exchange is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting on the 26th of this month to discuss and revise the salaries of Japanese staff and transaction deductions. It is also heard that Chinese merchants are indignant at the Exchange's multiple oppressions, so they plan to unite and establish another trading organization to counter and develop. It is currently under discussion. (Dated June 19th)</p>
<h3>Recent Panic Scene in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>The Price of Paper Money Plummets Again</p>
<p>Drought Situation in Southern Shanxi</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The problem of supplies for the troops stationed in southern Shanxi is being handled by the committee sent by the Deputy Commander's Office to distribute funds. However, the funds have not yet arrived in full. Even if they are distributed, the burden on the local area, which bears half the cost, is still difficult to avoid. Recently, a drought has developed in southern Shanxi, and grain prices have soared. The monthly salary of a few yuan for each soldier is not enough to live on. Representatives from Hedong, such as Jing Meijiu, have repeatedly negotiated with Song Zheyuan and others in recent days. However, it is still difficult to reach a proper decision before Shang Zhen returns to Taiyuan. Although there are rumors about the distribution of army salaries, according to military personnel, after Shang Zhen and others made various arrangements, they only distributed the arrears for December of last year and January and February of this year, adding 60% in Shanxi paper money. Only a certain amount of maintenance fees was issued for April. Nothing has been moved for March and May. Therefore, in reality, they are still in arrears for more than three months. Regarding the current situation of the armies, the generals have agreed to urge Xu Yongchang to take full responsibility for overall planning and rectification. Li Shengda, who went to Beiping to meet Zhang, returned to Taiyuan yesterday. Wang Jingguo will also return tonight. It is expected that the generals will have another meeting soon. Regarding the issue of Shanxi paper money, the price of the money has fallen further instead of rising in any way after the provincial government announced measures to maintain the price at 25%. The reason for the sharp decline is that it is related to the strength of the paper money itself and that rumors are also arising. What is most noteworthy about the current situation in Shanxi, apart from military and political affairs, is the drought situation in southern Shanxi. According to those who came from the disaster area, the wheat harvest this year is at most one dou per mu, and in many cases, even the seeds were not harvested. Less than 20-30% of the autumn crops have been planted. Recently, due to the prolonged drought without rain, even the small portion of seedlings that have been planted have withered. It is hopeless for the autumn harvest, so the food situation is presenting an extremely alarming scene. (Dated the 19th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Officials in Korea Strictly Suppress Overseas Chinese Laborers</h3>
<p>Korean Correspondence: Overseas Chinese in Japan and Korea have long been subjected to unfair treatment. The Japanese side has imposed extremely strict restrictions on overseas Chinese entering the country. In the past, overseas Chinese going to Japan had to follow the example of paying deposits and other inspection procedures before being allowed to reside. Since this year, even if they follow their harsh examples, they are not allowed to land. In Korea, in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese incited Koreans to form gangs and expel overseas Chinese. At that time, countless compatriots were killed and injured, and the loss of property was worth more than five million yuan. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly protested, the Japanese have ignored them, and it is still an outstanding case. Recently, they have been actively implementing expulsion policies, such as whipping and arresting, or forcibly fining, etc. The government officials have also strictly ordered the acquisition of permits. Only those with permits are allowed to reside, but when applying for permits, various interrogations are imposed, and as a result, permits often cannot be obtained, only insults.</p>
<p>In Incheon, overseas Chinese farmers and workers are expelled from the country if they do not have a residence permit outside their place of residence. On May 10 this year, the Japanese police station successively detained Bi Junrong, Li Qingde, Jiang Yunfeng, and others. They were first fined 20 yuan, but the farmers and workers were poor and unable to bear the fine, so they were imprisoned and beaten by the police station. The Incheon Sixth Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party's directly affiliated branch in Korea sent personnel to accompany the director of the Incheon office of the Consulate General of Korea to protest to the Japanese government officials, but there has been no substantial result to date. Therefore, people are panicked, and many have returned to the country in succession.</p>
<h3>Niaochiwon, Chungcheongnam-do</h3>
<p>On May 10 this year, a Chinese worker surnamed Wang, who had obtained a permit from Honmachi, Gyeongseong, came here with a Japanese man to work at Izumi Kaido. Seven or eight days later, he was seen by the Japanese police, who first told the Japanese foreman that those who did not have permission from the police station here (i.e., the Niaochiwon police station) could not work here, and urged him to leave the country twice. Because the Chinese worker was not very familiar with the language, he did not leave immediately. The Japanese foreman did not explain the actual situation to him. On the 31st of last month, he was suddenly summoned to the police station and accused of not obeying the police station's orders and staying without permission, and had to admit a fine. Wang was unable to admit the fine and had no choice but to flee the country. His whereabouts are currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Gaeseong</h3>
<p>The more than 70 Chinese workers in this area are mostly engaged in agriculture, carpentry, or stonework. They are diligent and frugal and have long been praised by Japanese employers. On May 23 this year, the local police station suddenly sent police officers to Liu Chongli, Liu Xuelun, Yu Shugui, Wang Hongzhi, Zhou Yanchi, Li Shizhong, and 50 other Chinese workers to demand verification of their permits. The Chinese workers Liu Chongli and others said that they had not been notified in advance that they must obtain a permit before they could reside here. Now that they are suddenly asking for a permit, where can they get it? It is clear that they want to implement a crackdown. Later, the Chinese workers jointly requested the local police station to obtain a permit, but they ignored them. They still ordered them to return to the country three times a day. If they did not leave by the deadline, they would be fined or arrested. Now, Liu Chongli and 56 others have no hope of residing and cannot afford the cost of returning to their country, so they are in a dilemma and extremely distressed. They hope that our government and compatriots across the country will provide relief.</p>
<p>The above situations can be used as evidence of unequal treatment. There are not few Japanese people who come to China to work. Customs in various places often do not inspect them and allow them to land freely. They have always been treated with hospitality and have never been discriminated against. However, Japan's treatment of our overseas Chinese workers is so severely suppressed. Where is the so-called amity?</p>
<h3>Changsha Qunzhi Students Destroy Newspaper Office</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Xiangjiang Evening News in this city has only been published for more than two months. On June 3, the newspaper published a news item entitled "Diplomas That Money Cannot Buy." On the 4th, it published a commentary entitled "Is This What Young People Should Be Like?" The article criticized a certain school of law and political science, Hunan Qunzhi School of Law and Political Science (i.e., the parent school of the Shanghai Qunzhi School). The students believed that the "certain school of law and political science" referred to in the newspaper was their school, and that the school did not sell diplomas. The newspaper published information that damaged the reputation of the school. On the afternoon of June 19, more than 50 students gathered and rushed into the editorial department of the Xiangjiang Evening News at Gaoshengmen, asking questions and demanding the surrender of the contributor. At that time, only the newspaper's manager, Tang Jin, and the distributor, Li Jianxun, were at the office. They came out to negotiate and advised them to use written procedures to make corrections. The students ignored them, slammed the table, and dragged Tang and Li to the Lezhongcun printing office (i.e., the newspaper's printing location) and took away all the old and new drafts. After the search, they dragged Tang and Li back to the school for disposal. When they were dragged to the Shuidao Lane intersection, the patrol team of the North Third Precinct Police Station heard the news and arrived to stop them. The students dispersed in a burst. Only Deng Qun, the student who led the team, was arrested on the spot. Tang and Li were rescued immediately. The patrol team took Deng back to the North Third Precinct Police Station for disposal. While they were questioning him, dozens of students from the school gathered again and surrounded the police station, demanding the release of Deng Qun. At this time, Mao Fengxiang, the editor of the Xiangjiang Evening News, heard the news and rushed to the police station. The students surrounded Mao again. Before long, Wang Shouren, an adjutant from the Garrison Headquarters, led a platoon of armed soldiers to rush to the scene to suppress them. He, along with the patrol officer Huang Kun from the police station, gave guidance in various ways. The students then lined up and returned to school, leaving Deng Qun, the newspaper's manager Tang Jin, editor Mao Fengxiang, and clerk Li Jianxun to be sent to the North District Police Station. Chief Li interrogated them clearly, and when they determined that the case was a criminal matter, the police station had no right to handle it. He ordered them all to be released on bail and told them to appeal to the competent authorities. After Tang, Mao, and the others returned to the office, they saw that the belongings had been destroyed and the drafts at the printing office had been lost. It was impossible to publish temporarily, so they temporarily suspended publication from June 20. On the one hand, they reported to the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, the garrison headquarters, the public security bureau, and the education department to request investigation and handling. On the other hand, they reported to the Journalists Association and requested that they uphold justice. It is not yet known how it will be resolved. (Dated June 20)</p>

<h3>Drug Offenders Convicted and Fined Separately</h3>
<p>Last month, in the Wang Qiaoxian brothel outside the North Gate of Chang'an Bridge, retired abbot Pu Qing of the Longguang Temple in Xishan and others were found smoking opium. The police chief of the Fifth Public Security Sub-bureau arrested them at the scene. Chief Peng of the Sub-bureau presented the prostitute Chen Jujuan and Pu Qing et al. to the County Public Security Bureau, which transferred them to the County Court. Chief Judge Zhou conducted the trial and released them on bail. Recently, Chen Jujuan appeared in court, but the monk Pu Qing repeatedly failed to appear. The original guarantor, Chen Baoshu, was detained and given a deadline to produce him, but he still did not appear. Yesterday, Yang, the acting judge, sentenced Chen Jujuan to one month of imprisonment and a fine of two hundred yuan for the opium case. After the appeal period, she will be sent to the detention center to serve her sentence.

He arrived in Wuxi late at night, and the porter Cao Shoushan secretly took some. Huang Xin was unwilling and gathered more than a dozen hooligans to demand it back, but failed, resulting in a violent fight. Cao's head was smashed by the hooligans, and he was bleeding profusely. The patrolling police arrived and dispersed the hooligans, detaining both sides and sending them to the County Court. Chief Judge Zhou opened the court, examined Cao Shoushan's injuries, and ordered him to return home for treatment. Huang Lao San was detained for further investigation.</p>

It is now learned that County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia was furious after reading the report and immediately telegraphed Director Xu to report the incident voluntarily. After receiving the order, Director Xu prepared a document and submitted it to the County Government, which was then forwarded to the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions. It is unknown how Director Hu will handle the matter.</p>
<h3>New Twists in the Silk Industry Relief Public Bond</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui silk industry relief public bond, previously decided by the government to be eight million yuan, was intended to use one-fourth to improve sericulture, one-fourth to reorganize machinery, and two-fourths to encourage raw silk exports and provide relief to the silk industry. Both the management and custody committees were organized early to take charge of the matter. However, after more than a year, the public bond has not been issued. All silk mills in Wuxi believe that the investigation procedures of silk reeling machines and silk inventory in Wuxi have been completed. However, the customs surcharge for the public bond fund has been in effect for one month, and the organization of the management committee has been established for more than half a month, but the public bond has not been issued, and the fund is still being collected, ostensibly providing relief to silk merchants but actually increasing their burden. If the relief funds are not issued as before, this fund should be submitted to the central government for temporary suspension of collection. Yesterday, the silk industry association reported to the management committee to forward the request to the central government to order the Jianghai Customs to temporarily suspend the collection of the public bond fund to protect the silk industry.</p>

<h3>Shipping Boat Robbed in Shen Port</h3>
<p>A boat sailing from Jiangyin to Changzhou was robbed on the evening of the 21st in the Jiangjiawan area of Sanhekou. Liu Bixiao Fang, the owner's brother, was burned, and He Canbao, a crew member, was shot and wounded. The robbers then plundered the boat and left. On the 22nd, the victim rescued the injured and reported the case to the county government, requesting an arrest.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike at Shenxin No. 6 Factory</h3>
<p>After the Changzhou Yarn Factory outside Xiaonanmen in Wujin was closed, it was managed by the Shanghai Creditors' Group. In 1927, Rong E’sheng from Wuxi leased and opened the Shenxin No. 6 Yarn Factory, which has been in operation for five years and has earned a profit of approximately 880,000. Now, the Changzhou Yarn Factory Creditors' Group has decided to take it back and manage it themselves, renaming it Minfeng Company. They notified Shenxin that they would take over at the end of this month, and Minfeng will open on July 1st. Shenxin has over 1,400 male and female workers. Upon hearing this news, they went on strike unanimously on the 22nd and put forward four demands: (1) All male and female workers should be paid six months' worth of severance pay from the date of dismissal; (2) Bonuses and leftover materials in the factory should be distributed in full without any deduction; (3) All workers' unpaid wages for the previous half-month should be returned in full from the date of the strike without retention; (4) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike. The factory feared an incident and requested the Public Security Bureau to send police to maintain order. Sun Fukang, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, led the police to the factory and instructed the workers to elect representatives to negotiate. The workers demanded that the six months' severance pay should be allocated by the factory and deposited in the County Party Department and Public Security Bureau to show good faith, and said that the four demands were all based on the example of the Dachang Yarn Factory's dismissal and were not excessive. Chief Inspector Sun promised to forward the demands to Manager Rong Esheng for discussion and announced that representatives from the workers, the factory, and the Public Security Bureau would be sent to investigate and verify. By around 7:00 PM, most of the female workers had returned home, leaving 300 to 400 people to guard the goods in the factory and maintain order together with the factory police, awaiting a resolution. According to news this morning (the 23rd), both parties are still negotiating.</p>

<h3>Eight Fishing Boats Robbed in Dongxing Sand</h3>
<p>In Fushan Port, the eighth district, this year's hairtail fishing season is still quite good. There are about forty to fifty fishing boats of all sizes, but it is still not as good as Hupu Port. Recently, the hairtail season is coming to an end, and the fishing boats are planning to return together. Unexpectedly, pirates are taking advantage of the opportunity of the fishing boats returning and becoming rampant again. On the 20th, a large group of hairtail fishing boats from Hupu Port, about a hundred or so, left the port. While passing through the Dongxingsha sea entrance, they were suddenly followed by three pirate ships, which fired shots as a warning. The group knew they had encountered pirates and fled. The pirates fired shots and chased after them, resulting in eight fishing boats being intercepted and robbed. There are now dozens of fishing boats from Jiangbei or Chongming anchored there, all feeling uneasy. On the 21st, the Zhenyu patrol warship stationed in Hupu happened to be patrolling to the entrance of Fushan. The boat owners all requested the warship to protect them on their return journey. The captain of the warship approved the request and decided to escort them out of the county to avoid danger on the way.</p>

<h3>Local Budget Meeting for Fiscal Year 20</h3>
<p>The county government convened a meeting of various agencies on the afternoon of the 22nd to discuss the local budget for fiscal year 20. After discussion, it was found that the local funds for fiscal year 19 had a deficit of more than 130,000. Even if all items were paid at 85% of their listed amounts, it would still be difficult to balance income and expenditure. A decision was made on the principles of expenditure without a method for clearing the deficit: (1) No new projects should be added in fiscal year 20; (2) Existing expenses should be tightened as much as possible; (3) Clear arrears, reorganize the busy season tax collection, issue local treasury bills, and request subsidies from the provincial government; (4) The expenses of the district offices should still be paid at 50%; (5) The expenses of the Public Security Bureau should be independently managed starting from fiscal year 20; (6) The monthly subsidy of 200 yuan to Qingyang Junior High School should be reported back to the Education Department as difficult to subsidize; (7) The county government gazette should be tentatively set at 50 yuan per month.</p>

<h3>Tongzhou Cloth Industry Cracks Down on Weaving Households' Cheating</h3>
<p>The Tongzhou Dachichi native cloth industry has recently suffered a major blow to its sales because the weaving households in the four townships are not seeking improvements but are cheating for profit.

Chief Zhou, based on his confession, believed that he was highly suspicious and sent the police to send Luo Yongnian to the Provincial Rural Clearing Bureau for interrogation on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Verdict in Case of Resisting Arrest While Gambling</h3>
<p>In late January of this year, farmers Zhu Yubing and others from Chongde County held a ritual for the completion of the new bridge, chanting scriptures and gambling. The nearby land police learned of this and went to arrest them. At that time, Zhu and others gathered a crowd to resist arrest, seized the police officers, removed their uniforms and symbols, and falsely reported to the stationed water police that bandits were robbing. The water police arrived at the scene, tied them up, and sent them to the district headquarters. The district headquarters investigated and found out the facts and released them all. The Chongde County Public Security Bureau subsequently arrested Zhu Liukun, who made a false report, and Zhu Yubing, Zhu Shunchang, and Fei Rufa, who gathered a crowd to obstruct official duties. After many twists and turns, Zhu and others hired lawyers to petition the High Court to transfer jurisdiction. The Jiaxing Branch Court was designated to hear the case. The verdict has now been announced yesterday. Zhu Liukun and others were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment.</p>

<h3>Rice Industry Granted Exemption from Business Tax</h3>
<p>The business tax in various cities and counties of Zhejiang Province has been prepared for many months and was finally implemented this month. Various industries have requested exemptions, but because it concerns the tax revenue of the entire province, all requests have been rejected. However, the rice industry associations in various places, because the rice and grain industry is of great importance to the livelihood of the people, specially submitted a request to the provincial chamber of commerce, which forwarded it to the Finance Department for approval to exempt them from the tax. There has been no reply yet. Yesterday, the Rice Industry Federation of various counties publicly elected Ge Anfu as a representative to petition the Finance Department. It is now learned that Wang Xicun, the Director of the Finance Department, believes that the rice industry is related to the livelihood of the common people and is different from other industries, so he has decided to propose it to the provincial government meeting tomorrow for approval and issue a notice of exemption.</p>
<h3>Rural Clearing Bureau Executes Two Kidnappers by Firing Squad</h3>

<h3>Unfilial Son Driven Away and Drowns Himself</h3>
<p>Yu Jiuxing, the son of Yu Awei in the Shalangyu area of the Sandi in Western Xiaoshan, never engaged in honest work and specialized in gambling and wandering. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, he owed debts and was unable to pay them. He asked his old father for money. His father Awei hated him so much that he drove him away. Unexpectedly, after leaving, Jiuxing drowned himself in the river on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival. The next morning, his father heard the news and sent someone to retrieve the body. He was immediately buried in a coffin by the river.</p>

<h3>Rampant Beach Bandits in Northwest Township</h3>
<p>The large reed beach in the northwest township of our county, which surrounds more than a hundred li and is bordered by water on three sides, with reeds reaching the sky, has always been an area where bandits appear. Recently, it has been occupied by the notorious bandit Fan Xianxi. The bandit gang has about 400 people and is a remnant of the "Three Legs" gang. They are extremely rampant. Ships passing through their area are robbed. As a result, transportation in that area has been cut off. On the 12th of this month, the fifth police team, together with the nearby militia, launched a suppression campaign, only managing to recover more than 30 looted ships. On the 13th and 14th, the bandits openly burned and looted the villages of Mengjiatai, Dengjia’an, Yaozhuang, and Yaotai. On the 15th, they kidnapped nine men and women in the northern part of Panzcun, killing four. The surrounding areas are in a state of extreme panic.</p>

<h3>The 55th World Tennis Championships</h3>
<p>丨Opened a few days ago丨</p>
<p>Surprising丨Failure of French Ke Xian Tuo</p>
<p>Formidable丨Japanese Players All Active</p>
<p>London, 22nd - The 55th World Tennis Wimbledon Tennis Championships opened on the afternoon of the 22nd, with tens of thousands of viewers. As the war began, a surprising achievement was suddenly discovered, which was the failure of French star Ke Xian Tuo and the activity of Japanese players.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Tuo Eliminated After Illness</h3>
<p>Ke Xian Tuo, a French star, was opposed by the British Nie Geer Shabao. Under the battle, the British Shabao was calm and skilled in shooting, making it difficult for the French star to cope. Ke Xian Tuo's full body skills lost his energy after his illness, and he sighed and left. The result was 1-6, 3-6, 2-6.</p>
<h3>Japanese Players All Active</h3>
<p>Japanese players who joined the competition are exceptionally active. Miki defeated Haddi 6-3, 6-4, and 6-2; Kawachi defeated Fei Zhi 6-0, 6-0, and 6-4; Sato Jiro defeated South African Gou Pei 6-3, 6-2, and 6-4; Aoki defeated Dou Pula Kesi 6-3, 6-3, and 6-3; Sato Hyotaro also entered the second week of competition without fighting due to the injury and abandonment of his opponent Magroof.</p>
<h3>American Youth Ready to Win Championship</h3>
<p>Although the American Iron Shield Dun is absent from this session, the championship is still very promising. Heroes are majestic and strong, and Sears, Rott, Ellison, Fan Ling, Wood, and Setho are all ready to win the championship. Sears defeated Spance 6-1, 6-1, and 6-2 without effort, and Fan Ling also eliminated Yugoslav Skivo 6-0, 6-2, and 6-1.</p>
<h3>French Team Has Little Hope</h3>
<p>Predictors say that France has little hope. Ke Xian Tuo has failed, and Bronon is still recovering from illness. Baurucra and Bausers have both been defeated by the British. Rakoste's performance has been greatly reduced after marriage, so he is afraid of enemies from Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Women's Championship Will Fall to British Hands</h3>
<p>Because of Mrs. Madi's absence from the women's championship, the voice of British Ms. Nat Ho is the highest. The enemies are German Ms. Olsen, American Mrs. Harper, and Spanish Ms. Taifolans, etc.</p>
<h3>Other Results of the First Week</h3>
<p>There are also other competition results from the first week as follows:</p>
<p>Kai Stiluo (West) won Tabada (British) 6-3, 6-4, 6-3,</p>

<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>16,840 Types of Occupations</p>
<p>We Chinese commonly say there are 360 lines of business, but if you carefully count them, I'm afraid there are more than that. As for various Western countries, they are constantly innovating in everything, so there are particularly many occupations. Take England for example, it is said that there are as many as 16,840 types. Among these many occupations, there are some with strange names, such as "Powder Monkey," "Bogey Mao," and "Spout Girl." Just looking at these names, we don't know what they are. In addition, "Alley Girl" refers to women in soap factories who are responsible for reviewing soap after it has been made and stamped with a pattern. They are called Alley Girls, but it is not known where the name comes from. Another example is "Sandwich Man," which refers to people on the street who carry advertising boards. They hang two advertising boards in front of and behind their bodies, with their bodies sandwiched in between, just like a sandwich.</p>
<p>Insurance for Warships in Movies</p>
<p>A great movie company in England shot a great naval film last year. For the sake of realism, they specially borrowed ten warships from the government and asked the sailors on the ships to participate in the performance. The government approved their request, but required them to insure all the warships for 20 million gold pounds to prevent any accidents.</p>
<h3>Strange Customs of the Taiwanese Aborigines</h3>
<p>— Li Xu Fan</p>
<p>Taiwan is located in a remote corner of the sea, facing Fujian Province across the water. It is rich in products, especially sugar. Since it was ceded to Japan after the Jiawu War, it has become a strange humiliation in our country's diplomacy. Whenever our people think of this, they cannot help but feel emotional. My old friend Mr. Song is a sugar merchant who inherited his family business. He has been in Taiwan for decades. Recently, because he could not get used to the oppression of imperialism, he retired to Shanghai. When he talked about the situation there and the customs of the aborigines, he found many things laughable, and he was particularly saddened. Now, I will record what I can remember to help with conversation.</p>
<p>Taiwan is divided into front and back. The back is mostly inhabited by aborigines. There are distinctions between civilized and uncivilized aborigines. Those who have been civilized are called civilized aborigines, and those who have not been civilized are called uncivilized aborigines. When outsiders want to exchange goods, it is all done through the civilized aborigines. During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, Liu Kunyi governed Taiwan. Later, because the land in the back was vast and the resources were abundant, he planned to develop it and increase the population. Through the translation of the civilized aborigines, he sent many brave and capable men to guide cultivation. He allocated 10,000 head of cattle for plowing, along with shovels and other tools, and seeds of rice, wheat, beans, and sorghum, and earnestly advised them. Unexpectedly, the aborigines were naturally barbaric and could not be educated. As a result, they slaughtered the cattle for food and drove the officials away. After several attempts, they were still not civilized. Then, they added military force to conquer them, but the mountain roads were rugged, and these people were used to crossing the mountains and hiding in caves, so the conquest was unsuccessful. It was even more difficult to achieve results than Zhuge Liang's conquest of the Southern Barbarians. Although the uncivilized aborigines were like this, the customs of the civilized aborigines were also not easy to evolve. There was a kind of crude custom of welcoming gods and holding festivals, which was laughable to hear. Often, in the spring and summer, they gathered a group of men and women, who bared their upper bodies, had disheveled hair, and dirty feet and faces, with fierce appearances. Their lower bodies were only covered with a red and green cloth skirt, which was divided into upper and lower parts, forming a flag gate shape, just like the battle skirts of the Qing soldiers. They walked slowly on the road, exposing their buttocks. They lined up in two rows, with more than a hundred people leading the way. In the middle, they carried a bamboo sedan chair that looked like a chair, covered with red cloth like a curtain. Inside, there was a human head, dripping with fresh blood. Especially killing people from other villages was considered a good omen. Two bamboo poles were inserted on both sides of the sedan chair, and four people shared each end. When they moved, everyone shouted loudly, no different from wolves howling and apes crying. More than a hundred people followed behind the sedan chair, each holding a burning incense stick. Finally, there was a person wearing a red-topped official hat with peacock feathers and a yellow jacket, and wearing black boots. He was called the "god guard." This kind of incongruous custom only reached the realm of admiring red-topped official hats with peacock feathers. Compared to the uncivilized aborigines, it was indeed a world apart. Even if we judge the national character of the entire Taiwan, their thinking is more outdated than in other places. No wonder they have been subjected to the rule of foreign races for decades.</p>
<p>There is another thing that is regrettable. The opposite side of Taiwan is Nan'an in Fujian. Footprints of wooden clogs are often seen there. All the lawless Hong Kong people often use Taiwanese nationality as a protective talisman. They all paste name cards with Taiwanese nationality on the doors of their residences to secretly resist the inspection of the local authorities. My old friend Wang Yongmei once served as a police chief there, but he resigned because he was hindered in his work. Now, hearing Mr. Song's words, I am even more convinced.</p>

<p>The famous scholars Mr. Ma Junwu and Mr. Chen Zhuzun live simple and frugal lives. Mr. Chen's eldest son is studying in the United States, and the expenses are huge. He barely manages to maintain it with the salary he receives from teaching at Jiaotong University and Great China University. Mr. Chen's life has been particularly frugal recently. One day last month, he took a third-class tram to Xujiahui to teach at Jiaotong University. It happened that Mr. Ma Junwu also boarded the third-class tram. Chen saw Ma and shouted, "You're here too." Then they talked about their feelings for a while and said that they were both in "poor" circumstances recently.</p>
<h3>A Lesson from a Meal</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chang</p>
<p>Yesterday, my friend Mr. Sun Jinfang told me about a young man's character, which is worth recording. I am now transcribing it here.</p>
<p>In the northern countryside of Zhuji, there is a man named Ling, who is the son of a wealthy family. When he was young, his parents loved him but did not teach him, so he did not understand the ways of the world or human feelings, and he was willful, arrogant, and impolite. His father was not ignorant of reason, but only thought that his son was used to being spoiled and could not be remedied by family education. Therefore, he planned to send his son out to study and learn business rules. Later, through a friend in Hangzhou, Mr. Lu, he was recommended to study at a certain bank in Hangzhou. On the day Ling entered the shop, he wore luxurious clothes and took a carriage from the home of the introducer, Mr. Lu, which was two li away from the bank. After arriving at the shop, he bowed to Mr. Wu Langzhai, the manager of the bank, as his teacher. Wu immediately disliked Ling when he saw him, because no apprentice who entered the shop had ever been so extravagant. After Ling entered the shop, he soon had lunch, sharing a table with his teacher. The dishes were three vegetarian and one meat. Ling was the son of a wealthy family and never ate vegetarian food for every meal. Therefore, as soon as the meal was in his mouth, he first put his chopsticks into the meat bowl. His teacher was very angry when he saw this and immediately taught him, "This is meat. Everyone at the table must put their chopsticks in the dish before you can eat it. This is the rule for apprentices when they eat." Ling was shocked by this and quickly retracted his chopsticks to pick up vegetarian dishes, and finished a bowl of rice. Then, everyone finished eating, and Ling said to his teacher, "Sir, I want to go home." Wu was surprised and said, "To study outside, you must complete three years of study before you can return home. Now you have only been here for a few hours. Why do you want to go back?" Ling said, "The reason why I came here to study is not to make a living in the future, but to learn the rules. I have just received a lesson from you at the meal, and I know that it is important to have etiquette in everything. Even small things like eating a meal require such attention. Other things go without saying. But because I received a lesson from you at the meal, I have already understood everything about how to be a person, so I don't need to stay here any longer. Although I am very grateful to you, and I am only leaving after following you for a few hours, the proverb that 'one day as a teacher, a lifetime as a student' should be forever remembered." The teacher heard this and did not know what to say. He ordered someone to call the introducer, Mr. Lu. Ling said the same thing to Lu as above. Lu repeatedly persuaded him to stay, but Ling firmly refused. Wu and Lu saw that his will was firm and his words were sincere, so they agreed. Then Ling went home.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after Ling returned home, he followed the rules and regulations and reversed his previous character. Therefore, his parents were happy, and the villagers praised him. Ling often said to people, "The reason why I was able to become like this is all thanks to my teacher, Mr. Wu Langzhai." It is said that after Ling returned home from his studies, in addition to writing letters to greet his teacher from time to time and giving him gifts, he would definitely go to Hangzhou in person every year to visit him. Ling is now forty-five years old, and his virtuous name is known throughout the village. My friend Mr. Sun is from the same village as Ling, so he knows him very well.</p>
<h3>Interesting News from the Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Xueni, a famous painter in Shanghai, advocated for round fans, so he invited more than 50 painters living in Shanghai, such as Shang Shengbo, Ma Qizhou, Xie Gongzhan, He Tianjian, Xiong Songquan, Wang Shizi, and Ma Mengrong, to paint landscapes, flowers, birds, and figures, totaling more than 1,400 pieces. They held a round fan exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Association. Those who heard the news and joined in included Ms. Li Qiujun, Lu Xiaoman, Gao Shiyun, and Yang Xuejiu, as well as the two poets Xiaodie and Jianzhi, who also displayed their most exquisite works in the exhibition. Wang Yiting, Shen Xinhai, Ye Weishen, Gao Shangzhi, and others also sent fan pieces on the second day. Old Man Zhegen was afraid that others would get there first, so he didn't sleep all night. As soon as the sky was bright, he waited at the entrance of the Fellow Association. When the door opened at seven o'clock, he went upstairs to select 24 exquisite pieces. While he was selecting, Wang Shizi and Xie Gongzhan both arrived. When they saw the fans that Zhegen had chosen, they laughed and said, "I didn't expect you to get there first." The humor was like this.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiujun personally sent the fans. There were dozens of people from the Ningbo Fellow Association trailing behind. They were just reviewing the paintings, and those who were deciding on the paintings were fighting with each other, and no one would give way. It was indeed a respect for her reputation. Ms. Xiaoman's paintings, as well as the fan paintings of Xiaodie and Shiyun, a total of six or seven pieces, were all snatched up by the painters. Those who arrived later all called out in regret.</p>
<p>For the 70th birthday celebration of Old Man Jianchao, a giant in the literary world, President Yu Youren of the National Government ordered 300 painted fans to be distributed as birthday gifts.</p>
<p>The painted fans of Shengbo, Qizhou, Tianjian, Gongzhan, Wuchang, Shizi, Songquan, Xueni, and Weishen were even fought over by three or four people, causing a commotion. Later, after Xueni mediated, each person decided on one fan, and the quarrel stopped. In early June, Wang Zhongshan, Zhang Yuguang, Xu Xiaocun, Gao Shangzhi, and others, a total of 13 people, initiated a fan surface exhibition. Even more people came to buy after hearing the news. There were even six or seven people who ordered the same painting on one fan. In three days, they sold more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Starting from the 13th, Zhao Banpo, Wu Ziding, and Ma Wanli opened a painting exhibition at the Fellow Association. I also went to visit. Banpo's paintings were priced at 15 yuan each, and they were all inscribed with poems by Pan Laolan, Zhang Lengseng, and Gao Zhenxiao, which were highly praised by the general public. I remember Pan's inscription on a peach blossom painting: "Double oars ride the tide as the sun sets, in whose alley is the small peach blossom? The roots and leaves evoke the beauty of the capital, a tree enchants, especially when it's in bloom." The style was excellent, and it could be called a perfect match with Banpo's light and elegant brushwork. The British consul Pei Jun saw it and appreciated it, and ordered four paintings. Wu's paintings were very similar to Xiao Xiaolou, and even more people ordered them. The large lotus flower painted by Wanli was purely imitated from Huishu, surpassing the master. Liang Gongyue wrote a poem: "The water of Mochou Lake is heavy with the sky, things lean on the new autumn, thoughts are lost. After the rain clears in the Zhuge Pavilion, the broken clouds and the setting sun pity each other." The three perfections of poetry, calligraphy, and painting were most admired by the visitors. More than a dozen people ordered paintings.</p>
<h3>After Reading Mr. Cai Zhenghua's Examples of Yuan Dynasty Opera Suites</h3>
<p>— Yun Jian Liang</p>
<p>Among the works in the Chinese literary world, the most exquisite, most detailed, most interesting, most moving, most widely promoted, and most valuable are opera suites. Opera suites originated from ci poetry, and ci poetry originated from the Music Bureau. However, the Music Bureau advanced to ci poetry, and ci poetry advanced to opera suites. This is the obvious and orderly formula of literary evolution. According to the Yuan Dynasty opera suites, they evolved from the great songs of the Song Dynasty and were called zaju. There were dances and songs, and the sheng, flute, and pipa were used to harmonize the music. The so-called song is the text of the zaju. There were many famous artists at that time, and Guan, Wang, Zheng, and Bai were the four great masters. Guan was like a drunken guest at a banquet, Wang was like a beauty under flowers, Zheng's voice was like jade coughing in the sky, and Bai's talent was like a Peng bird soaring in the sky. In addition, the remaining colors scattered like brocade were beautiful beyond compare. The trend of the times made it prosperous for a time. What Mr. Zhenghua described were mostly writers from the Yuan Dynasty. He had everything he should have, selecting the best and being detailed in his language, indicating the right path, so that those who study opera suites would no longer have the sigh of groping in the dark. His contribution to the opera world is not shallow. If the students who inherit his learning can trace the ci poetry from the opera suites, and study the drama from the ci poetry, chewing and discussing them, they will have high interest and deep taste, and their aesthetic understanding of writing will surely make great progress. It can be predicted that they will examine the life experiences of the writers of the time, who were subjected to the power of foreign barbarians, wrote about the suffering of the common people, and were filled with repressed and uneasy emotions in their writing, which were no different from the allegories of Ban, Ma, Sao, and Zhuang. Moreover, they were appreciated by both the refined and the vulgar, and were suitable for both ancient and modern times. How wide and deep their influence and promotion were can be compared to Gu Yong Qian Yuan Zhou. What is their structure? There are suites, and there are filler words and filler phrases. In their performances, there are distinctions between guests, dialogues, subjects, translations, beginnings, climaxes, and endings. The events are narrated in the dialogues, while the song texts are all spoken on behalf of the characters. Compared to the works of the Song and Jin Dynasties, they were indeed a step forward. The descriptions were emotional, vivid, and colorful. Their wonderful and unique points were able to make the listeners and readers lose their souls in the joys and sorrows, ups and downs of the drama, and cry or smile without being able to control themselves. Are they not extremely exquisite, detailed, difficult, and valuable? That is why I say that opera suites are the most valuable in the literary world. I was asked by Dr. Shen Siliang, the vice president of St. John's University, to review Master Zhenghua's works and planned to give him a degree. In addition to my comments, I am adding a few words to ask Mr. Wu Quan what he thinks. Written by Lu Guiliang on June 13, the 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club for Storytellers</h3>
<h3>???</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuo Dai</p>
<p>When Pan Ziliang woke up at dawn, he suddenly felt a stuffiness in his chest, as if something weighing hundreds of pounds was pressing on his body, which was very uncomfortable. He wanted to open his eyes, but the sleeping demon was still entangling him and would not let him go, so he still could not wake up. He only felt sleepy! But the weight on his chest was still pressing down. From his half-conscious state, he suddenly remembered something. He had heard a joke from a friend before: An old scholar woke up in the middle of the night and suddenly shouted for help in bed. Because he felt as if someone was tying his neck with a belt and planning to strangle him to death. Later, his wife, who shared the bed with him, woke up when she heard the noise. When she lit the lamp and took a look, it was truly a joke! It turned out that his wife's foot strap had somehow wrapped around his neck, so he was breathing rapidly and thought someone was trying to kill him, so he shouted for help. At this moment, Ziliang thought vaguely:</p>
<p>"My wife has natural feet and doesn't have foot straps, so of course she wouldn't make me unable to breathe. Then, what is pressing on my chest? Could it be that she is in a bad mood and put her legs on me in her sleep? That wouldn't be so heavy either..."</p>
<p>Just then, he suddenly felt an itch in his nose, and he was about to sneeze. This stimulation was so strong that it forcefully woke up Pan Ziliang, who was still in a deep sleep and had not yet reached his daily wake-up time.</p>
<p>Ziliang used all his strength to open his eyelids, which felt as if they weighed an infinite number of pounds. As soon as he opened them, but not fully, he was startled. It turned out that there was a huge face no more than three or four inches away from his eyes. This fright turned Ziliang from a semi-awake state to a fully awake state. But in the next instant, he was no longer frightened.</p>
<p>It turned out that this huge face was not some demon or monster, but the delicate face of his wife, Madam Yueru. He saw that her upper body was lying on his chest, no wonder it felt heavy. Her right hand was holding a hemp thread, trying to insert it into his nostril. Her face was very close, so it felt so big. As soon as she saw that Ziliang was awake, she giggled and retracted the hemp thread in her right hand.</p>

<p>Financial Standard Gold Plummets and Recovers Slightly</p>
<p>Recovering Nine Taels</p>
<h3>Changes Still Drastic</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 23rd, the standard gold market changed drastically, the waves were turbulent, and it was unstoppable. People's hearts were unusually restless, and everyone was terrified. The price fluctuated by more than ten taels. In the end, it rebounded by about ten taels. Major dealers had already chased and bought, so the buying side accounted for more, which was the opposite of the previous day.</p>
<p>Since the previous market had a difference of about thirty taels, almost due to the surge in the silver market, and the foreign exchange rate also rose by more than four points, the early market opened lower and fell sharply by more than ten taels. Afterwards, the exchange rate turned from declining to flat. By noon, the trend was high, and it had broken through 740 taels. The after-market also fluctuated by more than ten taels. Initially, Yixiu Li once exceeded 50 taels. Later, because the exchange rate, although nominally shrinking, was actually not tight, especially since the wind on the tree surface did not stop, there was another setback. Finally, it was peaceful, outside of 40 taels. However, the market situation is unpredictable, and it is predicted that the silver market may have to fall back this morning.</p>
<h3>Opening Plummets Twelve Taels</h3>
<p>Since the eight-month opening in the early morning, it has fallen by twelve taels, to 723 taels. The major interest rate rose sharply by one penny and sixteen and five-eighths. The silver price also rose by two points, and the private telegram added one point and eight seven five. People's hearts were empty. It was then reduced from 24 taels to 20 taels. However, Wanxing, Shunli, Qianchangxiang, Daxing, Yongyuanmao, Yong, etc., all advanced, rising 14 taels, totaling 34 taels. Then Bingxing, Zhifeng, Yongqianchangxiang and arbitrageurs sold off, falling back by ten taels. When the British gold was initially bought by the bank at 1.305, then it was 5.625. When the shilling was announced, it was 24 taels, and the listing soared by one penny. The US gold fell by 2 yuan 125, and the Japanese gold fell by one coin and one point, so it fell again to 20 taels, but the domestic market was flat. At this time, the buying sentiment was strong, and major dealers took advantage of this low price to drag in, so it immediately soared by ten taels, to 30 taels. At 9:45, it fell back to 25 taels, and then small households sold off, and then the bank bought British gold at 5.625 and then at 2.505, so the price soared by 14 or 15 taels at once. At 10:45, it reached 40 taels and 5 cents. Tongtaichang, Futaiheng and arbitrageurs came to sell, falling by five taels. At 11:00, it was 35 taels and a half. In a moment, the Guangdong gang and Yuanmaoyong, Daxingyong, Yuanxingyong, etc., competed to buy, and the British gold also rose. The bank bought 3.705 to 2.505, so the market was quite sharp, soaring by 13 or 14 taels. After 11:30, it reached 49 taels, but the British gold suddenly shrank again, only 1.205, the US gold 3.705, and the Japanese gold increased by one point. People's hearts turned down, and Changsheng Yongfu, Changhong Li, etc., sold off, falling by ten taels. At noon, it was 39 taels. Fortunately, the buying side was still continuous, so it pulled up by six or seven taels again, closing at 45 taels and 6 cents. The initial revealed price was 771 taels, a difference of about 50 taels before and after noon, only 22 or 23 taels, and then changed to 775 taels and 8 cents, a difference of 30 taels.</p>
<h3>After-Market Gradually Trends Higher</h3>
<p>The after-market opened at 46 and a half taels, and suddenly An Yin reported that Xiao Ba Jiu Anna's was 51 taels and 5 cents. Before long, Xiao went to three taels and recovered, and Zhifeng Yongqian Changxiang Futai Heng, etc., bought in, especially because it was rumored that the shilling would be reduced by one point, so the price immediately rose by three or four taels. At 2:15, it was 52 taels. Suddenly, it was indeed reduced by 2.5, the US gold by half a yuan, and the Japanese gold by three points, but it was not moved, because the internal market was flat. The bank had done 1.3005, then bought 1.805, so the rebound fell to 45 taels. After 2:30, because Hengxing came in, it rose by five taels. At nearly 3:00, it was 50 taels. Afterwards, it turned from strong to weak, because the British gold at 1.3025 was not easy to sell, and Yuancheng Zhen Changxiang Changsheng Yong, etc., came to sell one after another, and the Indian exchange rate had also increased by two or three Anna, people's hearts were soft, and the situation deteriorated, cutting down outside of ten taels. However, there were three or four taels of ups and downs in an instant. After 4:15, it was 38 taels. The bank had bought British gold at 2.505, and Wanxing, etc., bought in, jumping up more than eight taels in an instant, to 46 and a half taels. At 4:30, the market closed at 44 taels, and it had been done to about 45 taels. It was really a big storm, all caused by the instability of people's hearts. Compared with the previous day, it still rose by nine taels (according to the listing). According to the whole day, the maximum price was 52 taels, and the minimum price was 20 taels, with a difference of 32 taels.

The account was 49 taels to 46 taels, and the water supplement was 49 taels to 47 taels.</p>
<h3>Transactions Seek Excess Over Supply</h3>

Tongtaichang, Changchang, Huixiang, Yuancheng, Zhen Changxiang, and Fuyu all went out. It is difficult to investigate the other shops, which came and went out suddenly. The Dalian gang came out a total of 6,000, and came in a total of 6,600 strips. Mr. Wu sought more supply less. The Guangdong gang came in 1,000 strips.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Extremely Violent</h3>
<p>The Listing Initially Lengthens Then Repeatedly Shrinks</p>
<p>The Internal Market Is Loose Then Firm Tight Then Flat</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Vigorously Dump</p>
<p>The Results Are Obvious and Subtle</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sudden surge in the British and American silver markets was rare. The HSBC listing changed very drastically, initially lengthening by four points, and then repeatedly shrinking by one point and a half, still lengthening by two points and a half. The British gold was lengthened by 625, the US gold by 1 yuan 25, and the Japanese gold fell by seven cents. This situation is rare. Since the early morning, the British gold has lengthened by one penny, one shilling three pennies and 25, the US gold by 2 yuan 125, 31 yuan, the Japanese gold has decreased by one coin and one point, 1 tael 6 coins. At 1:40, it suddenly shrinks by half a point, British gold 125, US gold 375, Japanese gold one point.

The other exchange rates also changed three times. The bank's internal market was loose in the morning and firm at noon, initially tight in the afternoon and then flat. The gold market volatility is still amazing, with a difference of 30 taels throughout the day, making it difficult to predict. In the end, it rose slightly, just as the big fall and small rebound. By the end, comparing the closing with the previous day, the British gold shrank by 1.805, the US gold by 3.705, and the Japanese gold increased by 1.75. The Chinese merchants still dumped vigorously, about 67,000 pounds of British gold. Because the arbitrage was appropriate and the standard gold was 20 taels away, the return of the arbitrage strips was profitable. The banks still had a strong buying interest. The US gold was not very sensitive, while the Japanese gold was more than 1 million yuan. The market situation has shown a reverse trend.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Forms Gloomy</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending downward, and the situation is very weak, because large traders are dumping while the market is rising, and the contract amounts are particularly large, overwhelming the market. As a result, the market momentum has greatly loosened. It is widely rumored in the market that a certain merchant will abandon long positions, so retail investors are showing considerable panic. At the same time, the sales of spot yarn are even weaker than yesterday, but there is a strange lack of spot goods in the market, and most of the goods for July and August have already been sold out. Factory inventories have been greatly reduced, so some buyers remain calm. Although the silver price has risen, the sudden surge in overseas prices is relatively balanced, it is said.</p>
<h3>Human Marker (Cotton Futures) Down More Than Two Taels</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Human Marker cotton futures market this morning, the prices for all months rose by one tael each due to the soaring US cotton prices and flat gold prices. However, from the second to third trade, a large trader sold off, and the contract amounts were particularly large, overwhelming the market. Prices for all months fell by one tael, two mace, four fen, and seven qian. The market sentiment remained weak in the afternoon, and prices fell by another six to nine qian. The trading volume was 55,750 bales. It was found that Mei Kee sold 2,200 bales, Tong Yu 1,600 bales, Tai Chang 1,000 bales, Yi Chang 1,150 bales, Heng De 2,000 bales, Chang Feng 1,500 bales, Yi Da 1,200 bales, and Yi Yu 1,500 bales. Mei Kee bought 1,000 bales, Ji Feng 1,400 bales, Gong Tai 1,300 bales, Tian Long 900 bales, Geng Feng 2,300 bales, Yi Yu 2,350 bales, and Heng De 650 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>August 1660 20 94,050 November 1639 16 50,950</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Are Only Average</h3>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are relatively flat. It is found that various groups purchased a total of 1,000 bales throughout the day. Transactions among peers were 650 bales, and the market was flat. Customer groups imported 125 bales from Hankou, 200 bales from Guangdong, 250 bales from the inland, 35 bales from the northern groups, 100 bales from Shantou, 35 bales from Changsha, 70 bales from Tianjin, and 200 bales from miscellaneous groups, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Has Not Escaped Sluggishness</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still sluggish, but US cotton prices are soaring. The morale in this port is not high. Because the silver market is rising, and the yarn market is not good, there is a lack of buyers, and the market disk is becoming more and more loose. However, Japanese merchants still have no intention of giving up, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hankou Marker Down Three to Four Qian</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Hankou Marker cotton futures market this morning, the market sentiment was very weak, and prices fell by 2.4 qian across the board. In the afternoon, the current month rose by 5 fen, while the distant months fell by another 1.5 qian. The trading volume was 81,700 dan. It was found that Shenxin sold 3,000 dan, Changfeng 4,300 dan, Shenda 2,200 dan, and Xincheng 3,800 dan. Tianlong bought 4,300 dan, Shenchang 3,400 dan, Xinheng 7,100 dan, and Xingyuan 3,100 dan.

<p>Xing Heng 40.50 to .25 Sulu cotton imported 800 pieces, spot warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Foreign cotton yarn rises violently</p>
<h3>US Cotton Purchasing Power Very Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton soared because of mass buying, political news favorable to long positions, and strong support from Wall Street. Futures rose 67 to 71 points per pound, and spot rose 70 points per pound. British cotton futures rose 32-33 points, and spot rose 40 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose 55 points. Indian cotton was firm due to good news from Liverpool, short covering, and buying by speculators. Pingguoer and Aomula rose 6 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose 9 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram of the 22nd):</p>

<p>Food and Rice Market Falling Sharply</p>
<h3>Xin Zha</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market along the Suzhou Creek was still in a stagnant state. The market opening in the morning did not show any improvement. The buying trend was loosening. Rural traders had no appetite at all. Only 1,000-2,000 shi were traded in small lots. Jiangyin and Kunshan had sufficient rice stocks. The overall market price dropped by 1-2 jiao. Changshu thick japonica rice and Shipu Jiaoli rice, Fengjing and thin japonica rice, and other goods continued to arrive, but urban and rural shops were unusually sluggish. Prices fell by 1 chi across the board. There were few glutinous rice goods, and prices remained unchanged. Yangdu jian (a type of rice) was apparently firm but secretly weak. There was a lack of Yin Yuan rice (a type of rice), and there was no market.</p>
<h3>Hu Nan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were about twenty boats of goods arriving in the Huangpu River. Sales in the city were extremely slow. The declining trend of Suzhou-Changzhou white japonica rice was intensifying, requiring a cut of a small triangle. There was a slight arrival of Southern gang's Qingpu, Chonggu, Tinglin, and Zhujing early and late rice, but the route was stagnant. Prices opened 3-4 jiao lower across the board. Bian Yin Yuan (another type of rice) was not seen. There was a slight improvement in medium-quality transactions. Yangdu jian was affected by foreign rice, and the price fell by 1 chi. Transactions for various goods were around 600-700 dan.</p>
<h3>Weak Source Supply Makes it Difficult to Ease Wheat Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market showed an initial flatness followed by firmness. Initially, the rising exchange rate of the previous day inevitably stirred the hearts of people inside and outside the industry. However, because the general inland traders are currently in the midst of the new wheat market season, the source of supply in various production areas is still desolate. That is, the combined prices in various places are also higher than those in this port. As a result, the source of supply in this port is weak, and the general middleman has not been enthusiastic. Therefore, although there has been a huge change in the gold price, people's hearts can turn stable. As a result, this month is larger than the previous day's two fen, July is larger one fen, August and September is larger three fen, October and November is larger one fen. The current wheat market is not smooth. Although 3,500 bags of Nanjing and Hezhou and Chuzhou wheat have been opened, there has not been a real transaction. Only the goods of the trading house still have factory matching, and the opened high Chuzhou wheat is 3 taels 9 qian 1 fen, followed by 3 taels 8 qian 7 fen 3 taels 8 qian 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Initially Falls and Then Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, each month was affected by the plummeting gold price. Although people's hearts were once impulsive, the opening price of each month was about one fen lower than the previous day. However, because the factories were watching and not selling, and because the inland gangs were thinking about relying on the weak supply of wheat, they saw an opportunity to absorb it. In addition, the quoted price of foreign wheat continued to be good for about five or six jiao, so the market sentiment in the subsequent trades has stabilized. Until the opening in the afternoon, it was still flat and tired at first. As the wheat market tended to be strong, outsiders covering short positions made the market sentiment in each month slightly hold on. However, if it gradually relaxes, this kind of rejected situation may be difficult to maintain for a long time. As a result, this month is slightly better than the previous day by two li and a half, July is larger one fen, August is larger one fen and a half, September is larger one fen, October and November is larger seven li and a half.</p>

<h3>Various Trade Groups Discussed Amending the Sino-Japanese Agreement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resolved to Form a Research Committee</p>
<p>The proposal was immediately submitted to the committee for research.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the livelihood of industries and businesses involved in Sino-Japanese foreign trade, the China National Products Preservation Association convened a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Representatives from various industries related to the Sino-Japanese Agreement, national product factories, and trade associations gathered to discuss the Sino-Japanese Agreement. Details of the proceedings are as follows:</p>
<h3>Attending Groups</h3>
<p>Representatives from the following groups attended yesterday's meeting: Ma Yaoxian from the Danyang Silk Traders Association, Liu Fuqing from the Suzhou Iron and Mechanical Silk Weaving Industry Association, Yu Wenqing and Shi Junqing from the Wuxian Yarn and Satin Industry Association, Ge Tianhao from the National Federation of Commerce, Liu Qianfu and Xin Guozhu from the Shanghai Ramie Cloth Industry Association, Wu Huinong from the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association, Xu Hanzhang from the Shanghai Porcelain Industry Association, Weng Rongbing from the Central Soap Factory, Fan Zhongqiao from the China Agricultural and Mining Company, Yu Xingben from the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, Shao Jinqing from the Zhenhua Paint Factory, Cao Jingyu, Liu Shuming, and Ren Shenting from the Shanghai Seafood Association, Wang Xingyi from the Shanghai Brocade Guild, Wang Jie'an and Wang Hanqiang from the China National Products Preservation Association, and over fifty other individuals.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Jie'an reported, stating that the meeting was convened by the China National Products Preservation Association with the approval of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss amending the Sino-Japanese Agreement, which was signed on May 6, 1930, for a term of three years, expiring on May 5, 1933. To amend the agreement, a proposal must be submitted within six months of its expiration; otherwise, it will remain in effect for another three years. Currently, national products exported to Japan are subject to a 70% tax, while Japanese goods imported into China are subject to an 8% tax. As a result, national products cannot be sold abroad smoothly, while foreign goods can be imported into China in large quantities. This is obviously unequal and requires amendment. He requested that the attending representatives express their opinions as much as possible and work together to find solutions, hoping that they would conduct careful research to propose suggestions for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to adopt.</p>
<h3>Proposed Cases</h3>
<p>The Brocade Guild proposed: (1) Japanese silk transported to Korea is taxed at 8%, while Chinese silk is taxed at 70%, which is a vast disparity. Article 2 of the agreement states that the tax rate on imported goods should be the same as that on domestic goods. Therefore, Chinese silk transported to Korea should be taxed at the same rate as Japanese silk, which is 8%, to ensure equality and conform to the original text of the agreement. This is what should be strongly advocated for when the agreement expires. (2) Korea was originally our affiliated state, but Japanese interference in its internal affairs led to the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. Unfortunately, we were defeated, and Korea was forcibly annexed by Japan. Although this was due to might, justice was not served. Now that the Treaty of Shimonoseki has long expired, the territory of Korea should have been recovered and should not remain under Japanese control for long. Korea was the fiefdom of Jizi of Yin and Shang and should be within the Chinese territory. How can we allow it to be oppressed by other ethnic groups for so long and be subjected to the discrimination of this unequal tax rate? We should request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a protest to achieve the goal of recovery. (3) The tax rates for trade between the two countries should be equal. If Chinese silk transported to Korea can be subject to the same tax rate as Japanese silk when the agreement is amended, this would be a satisfactory solution. Otherwise, the customs duty on Japanese silk imported into China should be increased to 70% to serve as a countermeasure. The Ramie Cloth Guild also proposed demanding that the import and export tax rates between China and Japan be equal.</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>It was resolved to form a committee to study the Sino-Japanese Agreement. The structure is as follows: (1) It shall be named the Sino-Japanese Agreement Tariff Research Committee. (2) The committee shall consist of seventeen members. (3) Three standing committee members shall be elected from among the committee members. (4) Each committee member should be nominated by the relevant organization. (5) Nominations are sought for one member from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, one member from the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce, two members from the Shanghai Ramie Cloth Guild, one member from the Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Federation, one member from the National General Chamber of Commerce, one member from the Shanghai Porcelain Industry Association, two members from the Shanghai Seafood Association, one member from the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, three members from the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association, one member from the Shanghai Embroidery Industry Association, one member from the China National Products Preservation Association, one member from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation, and one member from the National Products Factory Federation. (6) Committee members should be nominated by various organizations within one week. After all members have been nominated, the committee will be convened. (7) The China National Products Preservation Association is designated as the convener. (8) The address of the meeting will be temporarily located within the Preservation Association at Nine Acres. The proposed cases will be submitted for research after the research committee is established.</p>
<h3>Anti-Drug Association Asks Authorities to Pay Attention to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Instructions</h3>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association stated that the authorities' approach to banning opium has adopted a policy of "prohibition through taxation," collecting opium taxes and allowing sales. Although the Ministry of Finance has denied being in charge of this matter, its content clearly violates the opium prohibition regulations and international treaties. Public appeals and public opinion are in an uproar, and local party departments and anti-drug groups have sent numerous letters and telegrams expressing their opposition, but without any effect. Yesterday, the full text of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's anti-drug instructions was specially published, hoping to serve as a guide for opium prohibition and to draw the attention of the authorities.</p>
<h3>Shanghai to Establish a General Opium Suppression and Investigation Office</h3>
<p>According to a certain gentleman in the anti-opium circles, the central government has decided to establish a special office for opium suppression. A General Opium Suppression and Investigation Office will be established in Shanghai, and Opium Suppression and Investigation Offices will be established in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei. Not only will the planting and smoking of opium be prohibited, but also investigation sub-offices will be established in major coastal, riverine, and land-sea intersection ports to prevent the trafficking of opium and similar drugs. The methods will be handled in accordance with the recently promulgated Opium Suppression Law. In the future, opium cases will be handled by this office and will no longer be transferred from local administrative organs. Local garrisoned armies or land and water public security police teams must not overstep their authority to interfere, so as to unify power. It is reported that Jiangsu Province has already started the process of organizing its office. It is heard that Li Muqing has been appointed to prepare for the Shanghai general office, and it will be established soon.</p>
<p>Shanghai City Opium Suppression and Investigation Sub-Office Director Feng Wenyu, upon receiving the order from the General Office, is actively organizing the sub-office for official business.

Notices have been sent to all military, police, and political organs in the city.</p>
<h3>County Reorganization Committee's Tao Yishan Ordered to Transfer</h3>
<p>Comrade Tao Yishan of the Shanghai County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee was ordered by the Provincial Reorganization Committee in September of the 19th year [1930] to serve as a member of the County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee and was also designated as the Director of the Organization Department. Since taking office, he has worked exceptionally hard and has completed the reorganization of the county's party affairs. A few days ago, he was ordered by the province to transfer to be a member of the Siyang County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee. After receiving the order, Comrade Tao originally intended to depart immediately, but he delayed it for a few days because of the opening of the County Representatives Congress. Now that the Congress has concluded yesterday, Comrade Tao has decided to go to Nanjing by overnight train on the 23rd to transfer to Siyang to take up his new post. Yesterday, all of the committee's working comrades held a farewell banquet for Mr. Tao, as he will soon leave Shanghai. At the end, they all took a photo together as a memento.</p>

<h3>Documents Regarding the Party and Government Organs Reorganizing the Wusong Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs stated that yesterday's newspaper reported that Wusong merchants were threatening to suspend business. The Bureau believes that, as the military situation at the front is developing, it cannot allow anyone to incite unrest and disrupt local security. It has strictly ordered former Chairman Zhang Zengjie and others to be responsible for stopping this and has telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to report on the handling of the matter.</p>
<h3>Document Submitted to the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>To Minister Kong Jun of the Nanjing Ministry of Industry: Regarding the reorganization of the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce into the Wusong Branch Office of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, this Bureau previously submitted it to the Municipal Government, which forwarded it to your Ministry for approval and reply, agreeing to proceed as proposed, and the order has been forwarded for notification. However, two months after the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce moved, it has not yet complied with the order and continues to use the name of the Baoshan County Wusong Chamber of Commerce within this city. Former Chairman Zheng Shushan has also been accused of colluding with tax agencies to extort shipowners and collect membership fees. The Shanghai Special City Party Department has repeatedly sent letters to the Municipal Government, which forwarded them to this Bureau, ordering a thorough investigation and handling. If this deliberate defiance of laws and regulations is not strictly corrected, it will not only disrupt the organizational system of the Chamber of Commerce in this city but also conflict with the Central Government's previous aim of dispatching personnel to reorganize merchant groups and strive for unity. Currently, on the 20th of this month, this Bureau, together with the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, sent personnel to the former Chamber of Commerce to receive the documents and other items. In addition to ordering the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to organize a branch office within a time limit and be responsible for the liquidation, this report is being sent to your office for review and approval for record-keeping. respectfully, Pan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. (Stamped)</p>
<h3>Submitted to Mayor Zhang</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of responding to a report: This office received Order No. 8621 from your office, stating that the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party forwarded a letter from the Eighth District Party Headquarters, which stated that the Wusong Chamber of Commerce was still using the name "Baoshan County Wusong Chamber of Commerce" in its external communications. The order instructed this office, along with the Ningbo Pig Industry Shipping Guild Jinglan Public Office, to jointly investigate and report on the case of Zheng Shushan, the chairman of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, colluding with tax firms to extort shipping merchants, and to report back for further investigation. A copy of the submitted report was attached. Upon investigation, the reorganization of the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce into a branch office was previously reported to your office by this bureau, which in turn instructed the Ministry of Industry to reply, agreeing to the proposed plan. We were instructed to comply accordingly. However, the former Chamber of Commerce has delayed for two months without complying and continues to use its old name to collect membership fees under various pretexts, which is a deliberate violation of laws and should be strictly corrected. This bureau, together with the Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, dispatched personnel on the 20th of this month to take over the documents and files of the former Chamber of Commerce. The case of Zheng Shushan, the former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, colluding with tax firms to extort shipping merchants, is also being investigated by personnel dispatched by order of this office, together with the Public Security Bureau. A separate report will be submitted later. In addition to reporting the takeover of the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce to the Ministry of Industry and ordering the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to organize a branch office within a specified time limit and be responsible for the liquidation, this document is submitted to your office for review in accordance with the previous order. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Zhang.</p>
<h3>Submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs issued an order to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the reorganization of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce into a branch office: To be complied with. This bureau has already ordered the said chamber to send personnel on the 20th of this month to accompany personnel dispatched by this bureau and the Public Security Bureau to take over the assets of the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce. Now that the former Chamber of Commerce has been dissolved, it is imperative to organize a branch office as soon as possible to continue to take charge and handle matters properly. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is hereby ordered to comply and organize a branch office within fifteen days of the date of this order, and to report the progress in detail for inspection and action. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters' Letter to Merchants and Citizens</h3>
<p>The Eighth District Party Headquarters' letter to the merchants and citizens of Wusong regarding the reorganization of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce states: Fellow merchants and citizens of Wusong, Wusong is a prosperous commercial district, and according to the regulations of the Chamber of Commerce Law, it is entitled to either establish a separate chamber of commerce or a branch office. However, it is not absolutely necessary to establish a separate chamber of commerce. The Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to safeguard and enhance commercial interests while maintaining unified organization, prudently suggested that establishing a branch office is more appropriate. In particular, it is not disregarding the Chamber of Commerce Law. Some people among the merchants and citizens of Wusong mistakenly believe that this reorganization is suppressing the merchants and citizens, which is a misunderstanding of the Chamber of Commerce Law. The sole responsibility of the former reorganization committee is to unify and reorganize merchant groups. It is unreasonable for a few merchants and citizens of Wusong to criticize it as a pretext and oppose the reorganization. Furthermore, advocating for the preservation of the old Wusong Chamber of Commerce organization is even less justified. We must understand that changing the Wusong Chamber of Commerce into a branch office is merely a change in organization and a change in name. The group is still a popular organization of the merchants and citizens of Wusong. Since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is carefully selecting candidates for the director of the branch office, the merchants and citizens of Wusong need not worry too much. If this reorganization is seen as disallowing the existence of the Chamber of Commerce, and opposing the reorganization is regarded as "fighting for survival," such a view is too naive and laughable. In the Ministry of Industry's instructions to the Chamber, there are indeed a few words saying, "Upon learning, after investigating the various points mentioned by the Chamber, there is some justification. Wait for a factual report to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and then instruct compliance." However, we must also understand that the Municipal Government's approval of the Ministry of Industry's consultation states that it is appropriate to change the Wusong Chamber of Commerce into a branch office, and the reasons are sufficient. It should be approved as proposed and instructed to be notified. We should pay more attention to this. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry's instructions to the Chamber only said, "Wait for a factual report to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and then instruct compliance." It did not say that Wusong must establish a separate chamber of commerce, nor did it say that Wusong will definitely be allowed to establish a separate chamber of commerce in the future. We hope that the merchants of Wusong will carefully study this point. As for the debts of the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce, the responsible personnel of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have also clearly stated that after the Municipal Chamber of Commerce reviews and deems them legitimate, the Chamber of Commerce will be responsible for reorganizing and repaying them. The merchants and citizens should not use this as an excuse to oppose the reorganization. It must be understood that at this time of rampant bandits and intense military situations at the front, the people of the whole country should be united in heart and mind to maintain local peace, so that our central government can concentrate its efforts and focus on the work of suppressing bandits. If we act rashly without careful consideration and allow a few troublemakers to incite and instigate, hoping to use the former responsible personnel of the Chamber of Commerce as their puppets and tools to disrupt order, causing various illegal actions such as automatic shutdowns, to achieve their destructive ambitions, it will not only violate the government's grand vision of eliminating bandits and actively building, but also betray the original intention of the merchants of Wusong to maintain the community. Fellow merchants and citizens of Wusong, we can formally contribute our opinions to the government, but our misunderstandings must submit to the correction of the authorities. We should represent the real people and make legitimate and legal demands. We must not be deceived, incited, or used to commit illegal actions. We love the merchants of Wusong, we love the merchant community of Wusong, and we especially hope that the merchants and citizens of Wusong can have a legitimate and legal organization. The Executive Committee of the Eighth District of the Chinese Nationalist Party in Shanghai Special City, June 23, 1931.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Cancels Proposal to Abolish the Transportation Industry</h3>
<p>But 5% Commission Will No Longer Be Paid</p>
<p>Previously, due to the Ministry of Railways' proposed abolition of the transportation industry, the local transportation industry convened a meeting of all members to discuss countermeasures and sent representatives to the Ministry of Railways to explain their difficulties. It is now learned that the Ministry of Railways has determined that the industry has performed well in circulating goods and assisting transportation, and has a long history. Therefore, the proposal to abolish the industry will not be implemented. However, the 5% commission (i.e., 5 cents per dollar) paid to the industry at the end of each year will be abolished from now on and will no longer be paid.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Resolves Merger of Transportation Organizations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly received instructions from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that the business nature of the members of the Transportation Industry Association and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Transfer Industry Association is completely the same. According to the regulations that no two industry associations of the same nature can exist in the same area, they should be merged immediately. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened several discussions, but no agreement was reached due to differing opinions. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened another mediation session. Representatives from the Transportation Industry Association, Li Mulian and Wang Xufu, and representatives from the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Transfer Industry Association, Shen Huiquan and Ge Laichi, attended. Sun Mingqi, representing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, explained the purpose of the meeting and repeatedly stated the advantages and disadvantages. After soliciting the consent of both parties, the following decisions were made: (1) The headquarters will be established in a central location, and the original headquarters of both parties will be converted into branch offices in the north and south; (2) Both parties will appoint members of a merger preparatory committee to handle all merger matters. It is reported that the Chamber of Commerce has sent the decision to the respective associations, urging them to strictly comply, and has submitted the decision to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for record.</p>
<h3>Uniform Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>All Kinds of Equipment Needed by Various Industries</p>
<p>Will Be Collected and Distributed by the Association</p>
<p>The implementation of the new system of weights and measures in this city is scheduled for July 1 as the uniform deadline. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has repeatedly ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify all industry associations to comply. With the uniform deadline approaching, the bureau has specially ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations to assist in the implementation so that it can be completed on time. All new equipment required by various industries, whether members or non-members, will be reported to the Municipal Weights and Measures Inspection Institute by the respective industry associations, and pre-ordered from the weights and measures manufacturing factory for unified collection and distribution. The quantity and types of equipment to be requisitioned by each business will be determined by the business itself. The industry associations must sell the equipment at the original fixed price and must not raise the price. It is reported that the Weights and Measures Inspection Institute and the manufacturing factory are both located at the original site of the Flower Tree Industry Association on Xieqiao Manufacturing Bureau Road. Recently, vendors and various industries have been crowding the place to requisition new equipment.</p>
<h3>Secretariat of the County Delegates' Congress Concludes</h3>
<p>The Secretariat of the Shanghai County Third Delegates' Congress, established on the 19th of this month, was extremely busy during the congress.

Yesterday, all the documents handled during the congress were completed, and all economic income and expenses were settled. It has been concluded.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Implements Tea Inspection</h3>
<p>To Eliminate Malpractices and Enhance International Credit</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Industry instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Regarding the matter of instructions, tea has always been a major export of our country, but in recent years, sales have declined, and there is a trend of collapse. The reason for this is that although teas from Japan, India, Ceylon, and other countries have emerged to compete, the main reason is that the manufacturing of Chinese tea adheres to the old rules, does not seek improvement, and is mixed with impurities and counterfeits, which is a major cause of the decline in foreign trade. In order to eliminate the malpractices of the tea industry, urge improvement, and enhance international trade credit, the Ministry has decided to implement inspection, which can no longer be delayed. The Regulations for Tea Inspection have been formulated and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing, and have been promulgated by the Ministry. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry to comply with the regulations and implement the inspection, a copy is sent for your information and to be forwarded to the tea industry organizations for information. This order.</p>
<h3>Business License for Brokers Temporarily Handled by the County</h3>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Finance Responds to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Business Tax Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance responded to a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which stated that the Charcoal Industry Association of this city stated in a letter that the broker's licenses have always been issued by the county. Now that they are called business licenses, it seems redundant if they are still issued by the county. The letter requested that a method be determined for forwarding them. Upon approval, the broker's license tax is used to fund education expenses in Jiangsu Province, according to the provincial and municipal division of powers. It is temporarily collected by the county bureau. Although the name of the broker's license has been changed to business tax in Jiangsu Province, it seems that the tax should still be handled by the county bureau in this city before it is recovered, in order to avoid disputes. The request in the letter is approved. A corresponding letter is returned.</p>

<h3>松江同乡挽留金县长</h3>
<p>Fellow villagers of Songjiang petition to retain County Magistrate Jin</p>
<p>Jin Qingzhang, the magistrate of Songjiang County, has served for three years and his political achievements are evident. It was recently heard that the Civil Affairs Department ordered him to be transferred to the province. Fellow villagers in Shanghai, Qian Gongpu, Zhu Pengling, Huo Yuanjin, Chen Ding, Shen Xun, Wang Longwen, and over thirty others, convened a meeting to telegraph the superiors to retain him. The telegram reads: "To the Director of the Civil Affairs Department: It was recently heard that County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang of our county is to be transferred to the province for appointment. The news has caused great alarm. County Magistrate Jin has served for three years, and has been meticulous in strictly prohibiting opium and gambling, suppressing bandits, and rectifying academic morals. His virtuous policies have been widely embraced, and all families admire him. This sudden transfer is a disappointment to the public. Although talents like Shiyuan (referring to Pang Tong, a famous strategist) may not be suitable for governing a small territory, we, Gongpu and others, were born in Songjiang and cannot bear to remain silent and allow a virtuous official to leave. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Interior, we dare to telegraph your office, hoping that you will consider the local situation and withdraw the order, so as to fulfill the wishes of the people and comfort public sentiment. We would be deeply grateful."</p>

<h3>各工会消息</h3>
<p>Various labor union news</p>
<p>The Fresh Pork Industry Workers' Union submitted a document to the Municipal Party Department yesterday, stating that a worker was beaten by a crowd and the case was reported to the police post, which transferred it to the court for investigation. The document detailed the circumstances and requested the association to review the case, uphold justice, and provide practical relief. It stated that there have been instances of forced purchases in the fresh pork industry market, which have been reported to the authorities for investigation. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 PM on June 23, at the Xuejiabang Fresh Pork Market, just as the market was opening, a butcher from the Changyuan Pig Farm wanted to buy a pig at the lowest price. At that time, the pig buyer Lin Ziwen was unwilling to sell cheaply because it involved his capital. The butcher tried to take it by force, and a dispute arose. Liang Anmin, a runner from Changyuan, mediated. Suddenly, another butcher, Zhang Xiaogen, relied on his strength to help and abuse, and became angry with Liang, thinking that he was preventing the customer from selling. He shouted and gathered a crowd to surround and beat Liang, punching and kicking him, and pressing him to the ground, making him unable to move, almost killing him. The butcher, knowing that he had caused trouble and that it involved human life, forcibly took someone else's scissors and stabbed his own leg, in order to shift the blame. This was witnessed by Xu Hongfu and others. His sinister intentions were unexpected. Fortunately, the police post detained both parties and transferred them to the court for review. Naturally, they will quietly await legal sanctions. Under such circumstances, the lives of all the pork industry workers serving in the market are in danger. Therefore, public anger is overwhelming, and they advocate a general strike to avoid the danger. After the representatives of the trade association tried their best to dissuade them, the workers unanimously decided to wait for three days. If there is no fair solution and no adequate protection, a labor strike may occur, which will affect more than a thousand meat shops and hundreds of pig buyers, putting them in a state of suspension. Therefore, they are making an urgent appeal, hoping that your association will review the case and promptly forward it to the court for a fair ruling, in order to appease public anger and ensure safety. This would be a great kindness.</p>

<h3>离奇夺子案</h3>
<p>Bizarre child abduction case</p>
<p>Zhang Qinchu nearly loses his beloved son</p>
<p>Fortunately, the child has six toes on his left foot</p>
<p>Zhang Qinchu, a local resident, is 32 years old and works as a clerk at the Xiangmao Soap Company on the Bund. He has lived at No. 6 Daqing Lane, Old West Gate, for more than six years. Zhang married Ms. Wu, who is the same age as Zhang and a native of Zhejiang. They have been married for ten years and have a son and a daughter. The eldest daughter, named Aide, is eight years old, and the son, named Rongguang, is four years old. Zhang's family of several people enjoy a happy family life. Unexpectedly, yesterday at around 11:00 AM, a northerner dressed in a Zhongshan suit claiming to be Wu Maoting and a woman from Jiangbei, along with several police officers from the Second District General Office, first knocked frequently on Zhang's back door. At that time, Zhang's brother-in-law, Wu Shuiting, opened the door. The police immediately asked if this was a knitted socks factory. Wu replied that this was where the clerk of the Xiangmao Soap Company lived and there was no so-called socks factory. After the police finished questioning, they repeatedly asked the residents at the entrance of the lane. Finally, they returned to Zhang's house. At that time, Zhang's young son, Rongguang, was playing in the living room. The woman from Jiangbei stared at Rongguang for a long time and said that he looked very much like her son. After saying that, the person in the Zhongshan suit instructed the police to detain Rongguang, Zhang's brother-in-law Wu Shuiting, and Zhang's sister-in-law Wu Yuwen together. After the district chief questioned them in detail, the person in the Zhongshan suit claimed to be Wu Maoting, who had held military positions. He stated that he and his wife had a son in Shanghai in 1929. At that time, he had to leave Shanghai for work, so he took his wife along. Because it was difficult to carry the baby along the way, he entrusted Qiao Shen, a woman from Gaoyou whom he knew and lived in Gaochang Temple, to take care of him and paid her 8 yuan a month for breastfeeding. At first, they often exchanged letters, but eventually there was no news. When he returned to Shanghai this time, he visited Shen, but she had disappeared without a trace. Yesterday morning, he happened to meet Shen near the World on Aidaoya Road. When he questioned her, Shen claimed that the child had been sold by her to someone for a price of 30 yuan. However, Shen said that she still remembered the address of the person who took care of him as being in a residence in Daqing Lane, Old West Gate. Therefore, she was detained and the police were sent to investigate at the address. However, after inquiring with the residents in the lane, there was no such child. Later, they went to Zhang's house and saw a child who was about the same age as her son. It was generally determined that Shen had sold him to the Zhang family. When asked Qiao Shen, she confessed that she had initially taken care of the child entrusted to her. However, eventually, even though she was paid 8 yuan a month, she did not receive any money after a while, so she was unable to continue taking care of him. Therefore, she entrusted a barber whom she knew, who then entrusted a Zhang to sell him to a resident in Daqing Lane, receiving 30 yuan. When asked Wu Yuwen and Wu Shuiting, they both claimed that he was their sister's biological son. It was absurd for someone to come and falsely claim him now. After questioning, the order was given to temporarily detain Wu Yuwen and Rongguang. Wu Shuiting rushed to the Xiangmao Foreign Company on the Bund and told Zhang Qinchu in detail. Zhang was furious when he heard this and rushed to the Second District General Office, declaring that he was his biological son. District Chief Wang reviewed the case again. Both sides still insisted on their own words. Zhang had no choice but to ask if there were any special marks on the child's body or any special differences in his feet. Shen and the person in the Zhongshan suit both said that he was no different from ordinary people. Zhang then took off the leather shoes that Rongguang was wearing on his left foot in front of everyone. Everyone watched closely. Unexpectedly, next to the smallest toe on Rongguang's left foot, there was another toe. It was clearly a six-toed child. Shen and the others were speechless. Thus, this bizarre child abduction case was revealed.</p>
<h3>赵案凶犯讯结</h3>
<p>The Zhao case murderers are interrogated</p>
<p>Verdict to be announced soon</p>
<p>The murderers Xia Shaoen, Wang Jinshan, and Cheng Enbo, who assassinated Zhao Tieqiao, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, have been prosecuted by the local court. Judge Zhao Yongzhou has been investigating the case for several months and has finally come to a clear understanding. Yesterday morning, the three murderers were brought to the case for interrogation and still denied their crimes. However, the murderers had already confessed to the prosecutor. The judge then announced the start of the debate. The prosecutor argued that the defendants had committed the crime of murder and requested a public trial. After the appointed defense lawyer defended them, the judge announced the end of the debate and waited for the verdict. The defendants were sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>朱元桃案蒸骨后再鉴定</h3>
<p>Zhu Yuantao case: bones steamed and re-identified</p>
<p>The cause of death of Zhu Yuantao, a native of Lianshui County, Jiangsu Province, is unknown. The case was accused of murdering her own husband. After the coffin was opened and the bones were steamed for examination, both parties were dissatisfied. The case was submitted to the High Court for review. All the bones were packed in a wooden box and sent to the High Court. In order to avoid injustice, the High Court ordered the Shanghai Local Court to send the bones to the hospital for identification. Yesterday, bailiff Zhu Wan-yuan went to Jiangsu and took the bone box to the Shanghai Court, waiting to be sent to the hospital for identification.</p>
<h3>朱礼耕案两绑匪处死刑</h3>
<p>Zhu Ligeng case: two kidnappers sentenced to death</p>
<p>Zhang and Hao were both sentenced to death</p>
<p>Zhang Shenshi sentenced to two years and six months</p>
<p>Hao Soshi transferred to the French Court</p>
<p>Zhu Ligeng, the owner of the Zhongfu Silk Mill in Chabei, who lived on Changsha Road, was kidnapped at 8:30 AM on April 4 when he went to the factory to work. Fortunately, Zhu was alert and escaped. Later, the French police arrested the kidnappers Zhang Debiao, Hao Zifeng, and their wives Zhang Shenshi and Hao Soshi. They were transferred to the Special District Local Court. After repeated trials, it was confirmed that they carried a pistol for the bandits to use. Only Hao Soshi had not participated. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi took the bench and ordered Zhang et al. to be brought forward and sentenced. Zhang and Hao were sentenced to death for jointly kidnapping for ransom in accordance with the regulations on punishing kidnappers. Zhang Shenshi was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for intending to provide others with the means to commit a crime and possessing military firearms. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was allowed to offset the imprisonment by two days for one day. Hao Soshi was acquitted. After the verdict, police lawyer Wang Yaotang stood up and stated that the police had no objection to the acquittal of Hao Soshi, but since she had been sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the French court in another case after being arrested by the French police, although she was acquitted in this case, she must be sent back to the French Concession for execution and could not be released. Judge Wu then ordered Hao Soshi to be returned to the French court for imprisonment. The remaining three male and female bandits were still held separately pending confirmation before being executed according to the verdict.</p>
<h3>United in Death</h3>
<p>A Mechanic Foreman Makes a Trap for Himself</p>
<p>How Deep is the Young Woman's Affection?</p>
<p>Zhang Panqin from Pudong was a foreman mechanic at the Zhonghua Arts and Crafts Society in Caojiadu. He moved his family from Pudong to No. 71, Cunshan Lane, Caojiadu, to be closer to work and avoid the tiring commute. A young woman in the same building, whose husband was away working in another place, felt lonely in the unfamiliar alleyways and had an affair with Zhang. Despite frequent verbal abuse from Zhang's wife, her passionate love did not diminish. Zhang's wife forced Zhang to move to No. 95, Xinkang Lane, to avoid the woman, but the young woman also moved to be near him, almost like devoted lovers. Zhang began to feel the pain of his self-made trap. Recently, pressured by economic hardship, quarrels increased when his money ran out, and he had the idea of suicide. On the night before last at 7 PM, he and the young woman went to the Andong Inn on Hubei Road and rented room 318, using the alias Zhang Fangzhen, age 26. After the waiter left, Zhang immediately closed the door tightly and wrote several suicide notes, sending them to family and friends. Then, he took out the prepared opium paste and swallowed it with the young woman, and they lay neck to neck to sleep, waiting for death to come and achieve their goal of dying together. After someone noticed, they quickly reported it to the Laozha police, who sent them to the hospital. However, Zhang's poison had already entered his internal organs, and he was beyond cure. He died. The young woman had taken less poison than Zhang, and her life could probably be saved. Zhang's body was taken by the police to the Forensic Examination Office on Faelon Road that night. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo of the Special District Local Court went to the office to confirm the cause of death. Zhang's younger brother, Zhang Yushu, explained the reasons for his brother's suicide. Judge Guo ordered Zhang Yushu to sign a guarantee and take the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Gu Ronggen Suddenly Has a Wife Appearing After His Death</h3>
<p>Gu Did Not Marry Before His Death</p>
<p>Problems Arising from Assets</p>
<p>Gu Daquan from Wuxi passed away many years ago. His eldest son, Peitang, and third son, Rongjin, also followed him to the grave early. Only the second son, Rongzeng, and the youngest son, Ronggen, remained. Rongzeng had a son, Zhenhua, who is now nineteen years old and graduated from Fudan University and is now able to be independent. However, Ronggen, although he was a comprador for the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha’s Fengyang Maru ship, had assets of forty to fifty thousand taels of silver, he was still a widower. However, he suddenly suffered a stroke and died suddenly on February 5th of this year. The Gu family, believing that they could not allow the deceased to become a neglected spirit, decided through public discussion that Zhenhua would inherit the lineage. Therefore, on March 14th, an inheritance agreement was written and signed by the public witnesses Huang Gu, Yue Tingyuan, Deng Shucai, Huang Yiren, and Lu Xueling. Recently, a woman from Suzhou, Xu Ruizhi, stepped forward, claiming to be the legal wife of the deceased Gu Ronggen. Although she had no children, her husband had an affair with a woman surnamed Mou, who gave birth to a son named Genghua, who should inherit his father's rights. Why was it necessary to establish someone else's son as an heir? Upon hearing her words, Gu's relatives were incredulous. Gu Zhenhua, feeling personally threatened, accused Xu of fabricating facts to covet the inheritance and sued her in the Special District Local Court, requesting confirmation that he was the legal heir of Gu Ronggen. However, Xu also filed a lawsuit against Gu Rongzeng, Zhenhua's biological father. Her purpose was to confirm that she was the guardian of Gu Genghua and to be allowed to manage all of Gu Ronggen's assets. Each side held their own views, and the truth was currently unclear. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren opened the court and summoned Xu's lawsuit against Gu for trial. According to the plaintiff Xu Ruizhi's testimony, she married Ronggen in 1915. When they married, Wang Mengnan, Dong Zhichu, Zhu Boyong, Wang Runsen, Tan Kuixian, and other relatives and friends were present to witness the ceremony. The defendant Gu Rongzeng testified that Xu was not his brother's legal wife but only had a concubine relationship. She was originally a divorced concubine of a Li family and only became acquainted with his brother in 1920, living together at No. 872 1/2, Hongxing Lane, Beijing Road. Now she claimed to have formally married his brother, but why did no one in the clan acknowledge it? This was a fabrication of facts. Wang, Dong, Zhu, and other witnesses were brought to court to testify. They all said that although they knew that Xu was Ronggen's woman, they did not witness their marriage. However, Wang Runsen testified that he was the matchmaker for Xu and Gu's marriage. Finally, the defendant's lawyers, Yan Yinwu and Zhang Ding, presented the inheritance document, which stated that Gu Ronggen was unmarried and had no children, proving that the deceased was indeed unmarried. Judge Xie stated that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Cracked at the Gu Family Residence in Baoshan; Trial Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Kidnappers are Inhuman</p>
<p>The Female Victims Were Violated One After Another</p>

<h3>Yan Zhiqin, also Known as Yan A Si, Testified</h3>
<p>He was twenty-nine years old, from Yancheng, and lived in Tanzhiwan, Zhabei, Shanghai. His occupation was rickshaw puller, and he also engaged in kidnapping. His accomplices included Zhou Ermazi, A Da, Tang Youfa, A Er, Xue Renjie, Gao Laoda, Xue Er, Xue San, Jiang Acai, Liu Xiao Erzi (also known as Dao Ai), Tang A San, Yan Zhiqin, Qu San, Gao Laoye, and others, totaling fourteen people. They went to Kunshan to kidnap. That day, they gathered at the Daxiao Ziminzhong in Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai. They were already waiting for me in the Tiger Stove at Chadaijiao. Because I didn't go, they came to my house to find me, and we went to Kunshan together, bringing two long guns, two medium guns, and seven handguns. When we went to kidnap, because I didn't know how to use guns, I went forward empty-handed. First, we kidnapped two women, then a man. Later, they kidnapped an old man, who was ransomed for two thousand yuan. I received one hundred and sixty yuan. This money was with Gao Laoye. Gao said that it would be distributed together after all the hostages were ransomed. I stayed on the boat for five days. Because I felt lonely, I slept with one of the older female hostages and had intercourse with her one night. How much money was needed to ransom these hostages had not yet been decided. Xue Renjie, Gao Laoye, and Zhou Ermazi were the leaders of the gang. I don't know where they live in Shanghai. (2) Kidnapper</p>
<h3>Tang Shaolian Testified</h3>
<p>He was thirty-one years old, from Yancheng, and lived in Tanzhiwan, Shanghai. His occupation was road worker. The place where I lived was half a mile away from Xue Renjie’s place. Xue Er, Xue San, A Da, A Er, etc., were sworn brothers. On the day we set off, we agreed to meet at the Tiger Stove in Tanzhiwan, Chadaijiao. Then, on the seventh day of the fourth lunar month, we set off from Shanghai and arrived in Kunshan on the ninth, when we began to kidnap. We kidnapped two men and two women, in two separate operations. First, we went to one house and kidnapped two women. Then, we went next door and kidnapped a man. Then, we went to the left and kidnapped another man. After the kidnapping, they were all confined in the boat's cabin. One of the male hostages was later ransomed for two thousand yuan. In reality, there were only one thousand five hundred and fifty yuan. I only received three yuan, given by Xue Renjie. There was still a male hostage, for whom we wanted five hundred yuan. For the two female hostages, we wanted one thousand yuan each, totaling two thousand yuan. None of this had been agreed upon. I had intercourse with the older female hostage for three nights. The younger female hostage was violated by Liu Aidao. There were fourteen people in our gang. Xue Renjie sent me and Yan Zhiqin, Tang Shaolian, to guard the hostages on the boat. Because no one came to ransom the hostages, it has been a month since the kidnapping. My companions have all returned to Shanghai. In Chadaijiao, I heard that Zhou Ermazi, A Da, A Er, A Xiang, and A Si were all arrested. I used to be a road worker. Later, Xue Renjie said to me that being a road worker was very hard. "I'll recommend something to you that can make you rich." I only did kidnapping for the first time. (3) Kidnapper</p>
<h3>Liu Daoai Testified</h3>
<p>He was twenty-seven years old, from Yancheng, and lived in a thatched shed behind the Fuxing Flour Mill in Xiaoshadu, Shanghai. His occupation was rickshaw puller. Xue Renjie was my uncle. He told me to sleep on the boat. There were fourteen people in our gang. On the third day of the fourth lunar month, my uncle told me to help him and gave me one yuan a day. I watched the hostages, a total of three people, two women and one man. Another male hostage had already been ransomed for one thousand two hundred and fifty yuan. I slept with the older female hostage once and with the younger female hostage twice. Last year, in Yingziwei Township, near Taihu Lake in Suzhou, we kidnapped three men and one woman. After the kidnapping, we hid them in the west end of Caojiadu. The three men paid a total of two thousand five hundred yuan to be ransomed. The female hostage was not raped. (4) Female Hostage</p>
<h3>Xu Wu Shi Testified</h3>
<p>She was thirty-three years old, from Kunshan, and lived in Zhangpu. Her husband's name was Xu Liukui. On the ninth night of the fourth lunar month, I was kidnapped from my mother's house. There were only my mother and daughter at home. My uncle next door, Wu Yunzhou, had already gone back. After kidnapping me first, they poled the boat over to kidnap Wu Yunzhou. After the kidnapping, my uncle was ransomed for one thousand two hundred and fifty yuan. Including today, it has only been six days. When they were ransomed, they were sent to Shanghai on a Trapa natans boat. After the money was received, they were released ashore. The kidnappers wanted ten thousand yuan for my mother and daughter. After being kidnapped, we spent two nights on a straw boat. On the fourth day, we were taken ashore and lived in a Jiangbei thatched shed for two days. Then we moved to a boat, rocking back and forth, without a fixed location. I don't know where. I was raped by three of them. My daughter is only sixteen years old, so she has suffered greatly from the bandits. (4) Female Hostage</p>
<h3>Xu Yueqin Testified</h3>
<p>She was sixteen years old, from Kunshan. On the ninth night of the fourth lunar month, I was kidnapped from my maternal grandmother's house. I was raped by a kidnapper who had a newly shaved head. I was violated three times in total. I am not yet betrothed to anyone. Because I had already gone to sleep with my mother that night, I don't know how many kidnappers there were. Because I was anxious, I can't remember. (5) Male Hostage</p>
<h3>Wu Songqin Testified</h3>
<p>He was forty-nine years old, from Qingpu, and lived in Nanxianjing Town. His occupation was farmer. The house I live in is quite big. Because the landlord moved out, he sold the house to me. I have many brothers and no place to live, so they first kidnapped them in my big house, and then they came to kidnap me. I stayed on the boat for one night. I moved to a firewood boat for two nights. Then, I lived on a Trapa natans boat for more than ten days. Then, I was taken ashore and lived in a Jiangbei thatched shed for one night. Then, I moved to a boat, rocking back and forth. I don't know where. Because my eyes were all blindfolded, I didn't know the direction. When I was kidnapped, there were about a dozen people. I was frightened when they kidnapped me. They used the butt of a gun to beat me in the waist. I also paid two thousand yuan to be ransomed. The night before yesterday, I tried to escape and ran to Dafu Temple in Dachang. I was chased and captured by the bandits. I shouted twice. The kidnappers then pressed me into the river to drink water so that I couldn't make a sound. I was still taken back to the pirate ship. After Judge Huang reviewed the testimony, he consulted with County Magistrate Qiu and ordered that the male hostage Wu Songqin, the female hostage Xu Wu Shi, and Xu Yueqin be handed over to the Guard Corps to escort them back to their hometowns. The kidnappers Tang Shaolian, Liu Aidao, and Yan Zhiqin were shackled and imprisoned for further investigation. The court was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Good News from Kuling for Summer Retreat</h3>
<p>Among the summer retreats in the Yangtze River basin of our country, Kuling is the best. It is not only high and cool, but also the vastness and magnificence of Mount Lu, the sound of springs everywhere, making it a great place for sightseeing and living. Therefore, every summer and autumn, Chinese and foreigners often travel thousands of miles with their families to live in the mountains. Even those who have long admired the famous mountains and take a few days off to enjoy the coolness of the mountains are also numerous. Last year, because the bandits in Jiangxi were not yet pacified, there were fewer tourists. In fact, Kuling is a famous summer resort, and the local authorities pay special attention to local security. The guards are usually very thorough. Moreover, the area is hundreds of miles wide, with overlapping mountains and dangerous stone paths, making it easy to defend, like a fortress. Therefore, the news of unrest in the mountains below was frequent, but the mountains were always peaceful. Everything was fine. Recently, according to friends in Xunyang, northern Jiangxi has been peaceful for a long time, and the large army is gathering in southern Jiangxi. The central government is focusing all its efforts on suppressing bandits. The tranquility of the mountains can be further guaranteed. Therefore, more and more Chinese and foreigners have been going to Kuling with their families. It is expected that the mountains this summer will be as prosperous as in previous years. Transportation to the mountains is also more convenient than in the past. China Travel Service has branches or reception centers in Jiujiang Riverbank, Lianhua Cave halfway up the mountain, and Kuling to take care of travelers and provide accommodation for temporary stays. Those who go to the mountains can entrust the agency to transport their luggage to the mountain after arriving in Xunyang by boat, and entrust them to hire cars and sedan chairs. The hotels in Kuling can also be booked in advance. Therefore, even those who have never been to Jiangxi can travel alone. After arriving in Xunyang, they can entrust the agency to take care of them. Recently, gasoline prices have soared, and the price of cars to the mountains has also increased. The fare from Jiujiang to Lianhua Cave is one yuan and eight jiao per passenger. Each car must carry four passengers. If you want to ride alone with one or two people, you must pay the fare for three people before the car will start. Currently, cars are not allowed from Lianhua Cave to Kuling. If you are afraid of walking, you can take a shoulder chair. Each chair bearer costs six jiao, usually four people.</p>
<h3>The Local Court Specifies Office Hours for the Summer</h3>
<p>The summer has arrived. According to custom, the Shanghai Local Court will only be open in the morning and closed in the afternoon. It has now been decided that from July 1st to the end of August, the office hours will be from 8 AM to 12 PM. However, in case of emergency matters, officers may be assigned to work on duty to handle them, so as to avoid dereliction of duty.</p>

<h3>Children's Health Movement</h3>
<p>Held Yesterday in Yangshupu, Pudong, Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 23rd) was the first day of the Children's Health Movement held by the China Child Welfare Association in Yangshupu, Pudong, Shanghai. The 22nd was the preparation day, and a lantern parade was held in the evening. The participants were very enthusiastic. The situation of the past two days is summarized as follows.</p>
<h3>Official Opening</h3>
<p>At 6 PM on the 22nd, the opening ceremony was held. In the center of the stage hung a portrait and last will of the Prime Minister Sun Yat-Sen, and the Blue Sky White Sun flag. Next to it was a couplet that read, "Educate good children to serve society; promote healthy bodies to bring glory to the country," which was quite spectacular. The ceremony was presided over by Mr. Wang Guan, and Dr. Niu Huisheng, chaired the meeting and delivered the opening remarks. Mr. Wu Weide, Secretary-General, reported on the general overview of the Child Welfare Association's work. Then, Mr. Hu Hongquan, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, Mr. Duck, Deputy Director of the Health Department of the Public Works Department, and Dr. E. F. Duck, President of the Pudong Public Association, gave speeches, which were mainly about promoting children's health, hoping that the public would pay attention to disease prevention, and avoid the criticism of digging a well when thirsty. There were more than 2,000 people in the audience.</p>
<h3>Lantern Parade</h3>
<p>After the opening ceremony, a large lantern parade was held. The participants were male and female students from the Child Welfare Education Center, Pudong Public Association, Yangshupu Primary School, Yangzheng Primary School, Children's Welfare Factory, and Decheng Primary School, about 1,000 people. Leading the procession were dozens of specially made fly lamps, mosquito lamps, egg lice mosquito lamps, which attracted the attention of passersby. The Public Works Department Police Department specially sent several capable policemen to protect the team, and the order was exceptionally well maintained. The team marched south on Meizhou Road, turned west to Taopeng Road, turned north into Pingliang Road, then circled Yangshupu and disbanded at the original location.</p>
<h3>Film Screening</h3>
<p>After returning from the parade, a hygiene film was shown outdoors behind the Pudong Public Association. About 5,000 people came to watch, shoulder to shoulder, and there was no space to move. The platform, fence, window frames, and tree branches were all covered with shadows. It can be said to be a grand occasion. After the film was shown, Ms. Xu Yunru directed the students of the Child Welfare Education Center to perform a hygiene drama, which was praised by the audience.</p>
<h3>Physical Examination</h3>
<p>From 9 AM on the 23rd, a children's health competition was held. Dr. Yang Suzhen, Ms. Chen Demei, Ms. Hua Meijie, and others examined the children's bodies. All children who joined the competition received several souvenirs from the Palm Olive Soap Company and other stores, and they left happily. There were seventy-five children participating in the competition.</p>
<h3>Smallpox Vaccination</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Health Department, believing that children are most prone to diseases in the summer, specially sent seven doctors to the venue to provide free smallpox vaccinations for children. The vaccination started at 9 AM and ended at 12 PM. The work was very busy. A total of two hundred and forty-five children were vaccinated.</p>
<h3>Free Injections</h3>
<p>From 9 AM to 4 PM, the Public Works Department Health Department and the Municipal Health Bureau sent several representatives to administer vaccinations for adults and children inside and outside the venue. One hundred and sixty-seven children and five hundred and eighty-eight adults were vaccinated, totaling seven hundred and fifty-five people.</p>
<h3>Children's Bathing</h3>
<p>From 2 PM, Mrs. Wang Guan, Ms. Wang Aitian, Ms. Hua Aijie, and others presided over the free bathing for children. Most of those who signed up were children of workers, and they rushed to be first. A total of fifty-four children were bathed for free.</p>
<h3>Meeting Performance</h3>
<p>The meeting began at 8 PM. Mr. Hu Hongji, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, sent a representative to give a lecture on the main points of children's health. Mr. Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, Mr. Duck, Deputy Director of the Public Works Department Health Department, Mr. Chen Zhengfan, editor of the Child Welfare Monthly, and Dr. Lu Zhaien also came to visit and contribute. After the lecture, the Shanghai Youth Propaganda Team performed a children's drama, "The Play is Called 'Down with the Enemies of Children'," and a children's hygiene film was shown. More people came to watch than on the preparation day. The number of people was over 10,000. The meeting ended at 11:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Wei Shan De Er Paris Sued</h3>
<p>Citizens Accuse Zhonghe of Aiding and Abetting Theft</p>
<p>Shi Zhifu, manager of the Guomin Pharmacy at No. 410, Rue de Consulat, French Concession, filed a complaint in the Special District Court, accusing Xue Lianfu, manager of the Zhonghe Pharmacy at No. 32 1/2, Maugham Road, of aiding and abetting theft and other crimes. Yesterday, Judge Cheng Shangfeng heard the case in the Criminal Division II. Mr. Jin Zhiyuan, assistant, appeared in court on behalf of the plaintiff and testified that the Guomin Pharmacy was the sole distributor of Wei Shan De Er Paris. The retail price on the market was sixteen yuan and eight jiao per dozen. Recently, the same product was found to be fifteen yuan per dozen, resulting in a loss of business. After investigation, it was discovered that Luo Baohua and Yin Tingsheng, who had left the partnership, stole the goods and sold them to Zhonghe, so the price was so cheap. Therefore, I pretended to be a buyer from the Suzhou Zhongxi Pharmacy and went to Zhonghe to buy the goods. I bought one dozen for fifteen yuan. I wanted to buy more, and they said they would have more tomorrow. So I asked to buy two more dozen. Immediately, I heard them call 11217. This phone number was installed at the Guomin Pharmacy. I heard them talking to Luo Baohua, saying that the money had been given to your brother, and that kind of thing was needed for another twenty-four boxes. According to this tone, it can be known that they knew it was stolen goods, but they repeatedly bought them. There is actually a crime of aiding and abetting theft. Xue testified that he did buy Wei Shan De Er Paris, but he did not know that it was stolen. Because Luo claimed to be the manager of the Guomin Pharmacy, he could reduce the price. Besides, he only bought it once, a total of fifty-two bottles. Later, because he wanted two more dozen, he called Luo again. At that time, he really didn't know that Luo had stolen it. Moreover, he had no relationship with Luo, except that they were both students at Wuzhou Pharmacy in the past, so they knew each other. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Cheng announced that the hearing would be adjourned for one week for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Success of Vessel-Use De Shi Er Engine</h3>
<p>In order to expand its shipping business, the Zhenjiang Zhengtong Shipping Company recently built two new ships to operate between Zhenjiang and Taizhou.</p>
<p>They also ordered one 54-horsepower and one 36-horsepower Tishi-style engine from the Xinzheng Engineering Company at No. 378 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai. It is reported that they have officially started the test drive and are operating ships. The convenience of driving and the high speed can be compared with foreign engines. This is really good news for my country's shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Corpse Examination of Wei Min</h3>
<p>The suicide of Wei Min at the Wu Gong Hotel and all the details have been reported twice in this newspaper. Wei's body was taken by the Laozha police to the Forensic Examination Office on Faelon Road by car after 10 PM the night before last. Yesterday morning, the police sent Shen Zhongfu, a waiter at the hotel, to the morgue. Then, Judge Guo of the Special District Court went to the scene to examine the body. He took the seat of the public position. First, the detective presented Wei's will, which was a thousand words long. Then, Shen Zhongfu described in detail how Wei came to live in room 436 of the hotel and how he was found to have committed suicide by poisoning. It was roughly the same as the previous report in this newspaper, so it will not be repeated. Judge Guo said that since no family members of the deceased had come to claim the body, he ordered the Chinese Cemetery to take it for burial.</p>
<h3>A Tu Transports Opium</h3>
<p>City Party Department Staff Reports</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11 AM, A Tu, a Shanghai gangster from Minhang who specializes in selling opium, bought a large amount of opium, 650 taels, from a Gu surnamed person in the concession. It was divided into large and small packages, marked with money. It was hidden in a charcoal basket, intending to be transported to the countryside for sale by the Shanghai-Minhang train. Unexpectedly, his plan was not secret. He was detected by a small rogue, who tailed him from behind. Near Lin Yin Road outside the West Gate, two rogues carried out a forced robbery. However, A Tu was not weak either, and he tried to reason with them, trying to redeem the items with money. A staff member of the City Party Department noticed this and called the police to come. A Tu and the opium were sent to the Second District Headquarters and then transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine Association Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>The chapter drafting committee of the preparatory committee of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association borrowed Dr. Dai Dahu's office in Xiaonanmen to start drafting. Zhou Zhaonan chaired the meeting, and Yu Hongsun recorded it. After a long discussion, the secretariat and social departments have been drafted. A joint meeting was also held at the association's location the night before last. Qian Longzhang, director of social affairs, chaired the meeting, and He Yunsheng, director of the secretariat, recorded it. The agenda was divided into the following proposals: (1) The secretariat was divided into a propaganda section, with Yu Shunchen et al. in charge, and a document section, with Qin Bowei et al. in charge. (2) The social section was divided into Qian Longzhang et al. in charge of various agencies and celebrities, and Chen Yaotang et al. in charge of various medical schools, hospitals, and medical organizations. On the same day, the accounting director Dai Dahu, the general affairs director Yu Hongsun, etc., also held a meeting to plan in detail. All matters will be submitted to the second preparatory committee for discussion and then implemented.</p>
<h3>The Huaguang Company's Banquet for the Press and Film Industries Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai film industry magnate and sugar merchant Mr. Huang and others, jointly invested to organize the Huaguang Sound Film Company. After more than a year of preparation, with a capital of 300,000, they hired first-class talents in the film industry and cooperated to produce the complete sound feature film "After the Rain, Clear Sky." It has now been fully completed, and the results are exceptionally beautiful. In recent days, film buyers and theaters from home and abroad have flocked to negotiate for copyrights and screening rights. Its honor is evident. Yesterday, the company, in order to seek public judgment from the press and radio industries, specially held a banquet at the Dadong Restaurant. More than 300 guests attended, hosted by Chen Qiufeng, Xia Chifeng, and Mr. Zhou Shixun, the editor of the Wen Hua Bookstore's Film Monthly. During the banquet, Mr. Gu Wuwei expressed his gratitude to the guests, and Mr. Xia Chifeng reported on his trip to Japan to promote Chinese film art and the filming process. Finally, the guests unanimously elected Mr. Ge Gongzhen to give a speech. Mr. Ge's speech greatly contributed to the production of sound films. After the banquet, the company held a screening of the film at the New Guang Theater, which was highly praised by the film industry and the press. At the request of the owner of the New Guang Theater, the film will be released in the theater soon. It is expected that there will be an amazing success at that time.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Second Report of Fei Tang (7th Continuation)</h3>
<p>Abstract Translation of the Fourth and Fifth Sections</p>
<p>(A) Foreign Directors: Regarding practical suggestions for the future election of foreign directors, the reasons are summarized as follows: (1) The regulations for increasing the number of foreign directors should not only increase the number of foreign directors selected under the current system. (2) Regarding the representation of nationalities, a regulation should be established that is more practical than what can be represented under the current system. (3) A regulation should not be established for the sake of this national representation, which would cause the general electorate to be divided by nationality. (4) Both commerce and industry should have some direct representatives. (5) The separate regulations for direct representatives of commerce and industry will broaden the scope of choice for the general electorate in electing directors. (6) Members of chambers of commerce and members of other national organizations, some of whom lack the necessary qualifications to vote, have a close relationship with the interests of the International Settlement. (7) The plan suggested here will run parallel to the suggestions regarding the issue of Chinese directors and will not conflict. (B) Chinese Directors: Any plan to allow Chinese voters to elect their directors publicly, all the detailed measures in it, must be carefully considered. In the near future, the adoption of this plan may not be permitted by the situation. As far as I have explored, there may be significant difficulties in urging the most outstanding Chinese candidates to come forward and compete in public elections. However, it has been suggested to me that if it is stipulated that all candidates be nominated by groups composed of a majority of voters, or recommended by existing groups with considerable reputation in the International Settlement, then this difficulty can be overcome in part. The above has already suggested that any plan to allow Chinese directors to be directly elected by the general electorate should be supplemented by a plan, that is, some of the Chinese directors should still be elected in the same way as the current system, based on the direct full cooperation of Chinese groups, so that the elected people all have the proper qualifications to represent Chinese commercial and industrial interests. 5. Election Law: Adopt a suitable election law for public elections, including the usual safeguards to prevent fraud and undue pressure, and stipulate that all elections, except those handled by special groups authorized to choose their representatives, are supervised by officials of the Public Works Department. These elections are all conducted by voting. 6. Term of Directors: The term of directors in the future should be two years, with half of them re-elected every year. 7. Election Period: The annual election should always be held after the ratepayers' meeting. 8. Committee: Establish a regulation that allows the board of directors to elect temporary supplementary members of the committee, so as to determine the status of the committee member, and enable it to grant a certain range of executive power to each committee including temporary supplementary members. The chairman of the committee, if he is a temporary supplementary member, may attend the board of directors for the special purpose of submitting the committee's report. He has the right to speak when the recommendations contained in the report are debated, but cannot vote. 9. Appointment of Senior Officials: A committee should be organized whose specific function is to make recommendations to the board of directors on issues such as the appointment, reappointment, or dismissal of the heads of various departments and other senior officials within the Public Works Department. The board of directors shall not make any decisions on such appointments, reappointments, or dismissals unless specifically reported by the committee, and no new appointments of senior officials shall be made except in accordance with the committee's recommendations. The organization of the committee should have an agreed-upon basis so that it can represent residents of various nationalities. 10. Finance and Auditing: There should be a special regulation regarding the tasks of the Finance Committee to ensure that important financial matters are first studied and reported by the committee before being submitted to the board of directors for decision. The duties of the auditor must also be stipulated, and the nature of the report that must be prepared when certifying the annual income and expenditure accounts must be disclosed. 11. Publication: (A) Reform the content of the Public Works Department Gazette to make it more detailed about the various work situations in the bureau, and the text is more readable. The reasons why the Public Works Department adopted certain special measures are also explained in more detail. (B) Establish a more complete regulation so that newspapers can obtain timely information on issues related to the administration of the International Settlement. (C) When the proposed bylaws reach the final procedure, the board of directors should hold open meetings to perform its special legislative functions, so that the general public can fully understand the reasons for deciding to establish new bylaws. The open meeting of the board of directors held to achieve this purpose will replace the open discussion on the formulation of new bylaws, which has been given to special meetings of taxpayers. The report then added an opinion, saying that this reform involves an important limitation of the principle of joint and several liability, and said that the immediate implementation of the various recommendations may not be permitted by the situation. 12. Chinese and English Names of the International Settlement and the Public Works Department: The International Settlement itself and its主管機關 (Zhugejiguan - Chief Authority) Public Works Department should adopt Chinese and English names that express the broadest international nature of all its "public" words.</p>
<h3>Chapter Seven</h3>
<p>Describes the issues left for further consideration in Chapter Six, that is, since Chinese directors are a minority in the Public Works Department, whether special regulations are needed to protect the interests of the Chinese. It then clarifies the main issues that distinguish the interests of the Chinese from the interests of other residents, such as the issue of educational facilities for the Chinese. Regarding medical services, hospital facilities, and the convenience of sports, the interests of the Chinese must also be roughly considered separately. Whether there should be sufficient regulations for the above expenditures is a question. Before considering this question, the report first considers how Chinese directors have participated in board meetings since they first took office in 1928. Since the first implementation of the Chinese representative system in April 1928, there has been a sign of the relationship between Chinese directors and their foreign colleagues, that is, both sides are willing to make full use of all new opportunities in the conference seats to discuss and cooperate. If the attendance of directors is not important, it has no impact on the general trend of the Public Works Department's policy. This is completely wrong, because the power of Chinese directors should not only be viewed in terms of their number. Since Chinese directors first took office in 1928, the Public Works Department has indeed shown a clear development and adopted a new trend in the policy of several important events. The report then raises three issues, the substantive progress of which is indeed a direct result of the attendance of Chinese directors. What are these three issues? (1) The progress of education policy, (2) The new policy of employing Chinese to fill senior positions included in the recommendations of the Salary Committee, (3) The publication of the Public Works Department Gazette and Annual Report in Chinese. The power of Chinese directors regarding the decision to ban dog racing in the International Settlement and other events was also mentioned. The new education policy of the Public Works Department is detailed in the report of the Education Committee published in December 1930, and its principles have been accepted by the Board of Directors, which has been summarized. The economic aspects of this policy have also been considered. The report points out that the Chinese representatives' advocacy of increasing educational facilities and other actions inevitably involves increasing taxes, and in the past, the Chinese have expressed their keen feelings about the proposal to increase taxes. An important lesson is that Chinese voters and taxpayers and voters and taxpayers of other nationalities must understand that the public undertakings of improvement and the new institutions that benefit the people must be funded by increased taxes. Furthermore, if you want to consider whether this price is worth paying, the benefits that must be taken into account are not the interests of individuals, but the general interests of all residents. The funds needed to implement the new education policy should be subsidized by all residents. The fair distribution of these funds to various parts of the residents should be based on the comparison of the needs of each part, rather than the number of wheels that each part has transferred. This will reverse the previous situation. Although the taxes paid by the Chinese accounted for more than half of the income of the Public Works Department, the fees for educational facilities obtained by the Chinese only accounted for a small part of the allocated educational expenses. In the future, if we insist on the new education policy and implement the new education plan, the number of all educational expenses that must be allocated to Chinese schools will exceed the proportion of Chinese wheels in municipal income. The report then makes a suggestion that "If the representatives of Chinese society are willing, a guarantee can be included in the property charter, stipulating that unless the majority of Chinese directors agree to reduce the specified number within any special year, in any case, for at least a certain period of time, the education and other specific expenses of the International Settlement for the special interests of the Chinese people in the boundary shall be increased by a few percent each year. There is also a possible alternative method, that is, within the property charter, stipulate a special annual land tax and house rent, and determine its percentage according to Article 9 of the property charter, for education and social improvement, and it can be stipulated that a fixed part of the income from this tax should be used for the special interests of the Chinese. The report suggests that there must be a regulation for the schools established by the Public Works Department and the schools subsidized by the Public Works Department, so that the interests of all parts of the International Settlement can have reasonable and necessary guarantees. What is this regulation? That is, any method of managing schools established by the Public Works Department and any plan to subsidize private schools must be accompanied by a condition, that is, "The education of each related school shall not have the slightest purpose of encouraging international or racial antipathy." In terms of the nature of textbooks adopted by some schools, this condition is not considered superfluous, because the governance system of the International Settlement is based on international partnership, not only the partnership between foreign countries, but also the partnership between China and various foreign countries. Assuming that the Public Works Department, composed of representatives of various nationalities, cooperates for the common interests of all citizens to handle the administration of the International Settlement, it knowingly or intentionally allocates any part of its income to maintain various schools, and the children of various nationalities represented by the education community are convinced that, historically, it is necessary to treat each other as hereditary enemies, or that hating foreigners is the first duty of a good citizen of a country. Is it not strange? The international cooperation of the Public Works Department cannot be based on the international hatred of various schools. The regulations proposed above apply quite broadly, meaning that propaganda against any one country or any number of countries should also be prohibited. There is no doubt that it is difficult to guarantee that this regulation can be observed unswervingly, but if this regulation can be recognized by the public, it is already a guarantee and an important step towards the right path in the way of heaven.</p>
<h3>Chapter Eight</h3>
<p>Describes the three topics specifically mentioned in the third question, that is, the various shortcomings of the current situation, as well as the reforms that should be made regarding (B) the powers and tasks of the Public Works Department in the International Settlement, (C) the powers that consuls and ministers of various countries can exercise over the International Settlement affairs, and (D) the relationship between the Public Works Department and the Chinese government authorities. The current situation of the above events has been considered. Regarding the power of the Public Works Department and the relationship between the Public Works Department and the Chinese authorities, the discussion is as follows: The fundamental difference in nature between the power exercised by the Public Works Department and the power exercised by the Chinese government officials has been explained in the first parts of this report. Although the new governance system of Chinese municipal areas is very different from the old governance system under the Taoist and his subordinates, and represents great progress, there is still a significant difference in principle between the Public Works Department's governance system and the Chinese-ruled municipal government, because on the one hand, it is still an organ whose power is generally of an unlimited nature, and the laws and regulations on which it is based allow individual officials to enter and exit at will. The scope is also wide, and the exercise of this power by this organ is not controlled by independent courts. As for the other hand, it is another organ whose power is much more limited, and the regulations on which it is based allow individual officials to enter and exit at will. The space is very narrow, and it must be controlled by a completely independent court. All the objections to the two organs exercising mutually independent powers in the same area for the same people still exist today. Assuming that the government of the International Settlement is still well-governed by the Public Works Department's governance system, the powers exercised by the Public Works Department in the International Settlement must still be of a unique nature and cannot create a system that forcibly combines the governance work of the two organs in the same area. This means that the power to govern the International Settlement cannot be divided, so that part of it is exercised by the officials of the International Settlement and part of it is exercised by the officials of the municipal government in the Chinese area, and the work of the two groups of officials is not related to each other. Methods of cooperation can be agreed upon and should be agreed upon, but only within the scope of the Public Works Department's consent and under the conditions of its consent can Chinese municipal officials exercise their powers in the International Settlement. The issue of applying the laws implemented by bureaucratic authorities in the Chinese area to the International Settlement has been discussed. The difficulties of the Public Works Department assuming the general responsibility for implementing this law in the International Settlement have been revealed. The issue of cooperation between the Public Works Department and the Chinese authorities has been discussed again as follows: From the surface, since a new-style municipal government has been established in the Chinese area linked to the International Settlement, it can be hoped that it can improve the relationship between the Public Works Department and the local Chinese authorities. For hygiene and police affairs, both parties have been prepared to recognize their common interests and can adopt various methods within their respective jurisdictions to provide valuable assistance to each other. However, although there has been some cooperation between the two organs, this cooperation has not been smooth in certain aspects and has sometimes resulted in many conflicts. If it was clearly stated at the beginning that the International Settlement is still an independent area and is not under the jurisdiction of the Chinese municipal government, then there could have been better expectations for the cooperation between the two organs and the progress of friendly relations. However, the request put forward by the representatives of the Chinese municipal government was that all the slightly vague regulations in the Shanghai Special Municipal Organization Law have the effect of including the International Settlement within the Chinese municipal area. This request has had unfortunate consequences. Some enthusiastic officials in the Chinese area regard it as their duty to take independent actions within the International Settlement and disregard the powers of the Public Works Department, especially in matters that the Public Works Department has not been clearly authorized to handle. The Public Works Department and its officials had to resist this attempt. Although there were political difficulties and conflicts over important issues of jurisdiction, there has been valuable cooperation between the two parties for certain common purposes. They have responded to and worked together to defend against public dangers such as public disturbances, epidemics, and food shortages. However, a better environment should be created to obtain closer cooperation. If a clear agreement can be reached on the jurisdictional issues in dispute, it will greatly benefit the creation of this environment. The addition of Chinese to the Board of Directors and other changes to the Organizational Law, as suggested in this report, are intended to allow the Chinese community to fully participate in the administration of the International Settlement, which should contribute to improvements. It is strongly advocated that the cooperation between the Public Works Department, the unified legal organ of the International Settlement, and the Chinese authorities outside the settlement should be in harmony with the cooperation between Chinese and foreign residents in the International Settlement. Under the new circumstances, the Public Works Department should no longer be regarded as a foreign organ, and all its actions should be guarded against, monitored, and restricted as much as possible, but should be regarded as an organ in which Chinese and foreign residents work together to manage the interests of the residents of the parts of the International Settlement that cannot be separated from all Shanghai residents. Is this claim not fair? If this can be done, it should enable the directors and their powers of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement on the one hand, and the officials of the municipal government in the Chinese area connected to the International Settlement on the other hand, to regard each other as allies and colleagues, rather than as rivals or enemies.</p>
