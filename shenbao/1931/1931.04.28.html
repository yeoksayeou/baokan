<p>「社會生産落後人民生計苦窘」確是吾國目前的現象而最足使人痛惜者爲畢業於學校失業於社會者之日益加增此輩散在社會其知識慾望固巳超越平民而却無一技專長有志高攀無術謀生在彼則悵悵何之在社會則望而生畏此種現象於國家前途隱憂曷極最近敎育部洞燭原因扶其利害普告全國其最要之幾句曰「我國興學三十年社會生産落後人民生計苦窘日益加甚其故蓋由普通學校向不注重職業敎育……」一語破的實獲我心在我人夙昔揭　「職業敎育」以奔走呼號於社會者一旦覩此明諭其歡欣鼓舞預祝職業敎育之成功自在人先蓋非有私於吾儕平昔之主張實爲國家社會想宜若此也</p>
<p>雖然天下事固非絶對者往往利之所在害亦伏焉故我於敎育部大提創職業敎育聲中乃有一則以喜一則以懼之感也吾國興學三十年誠然向未注得職業敎育但在民國五年至十五年十年間職業敎育之呼聲亦嘗高唱入雲甲乙實業學校且編於各省區乃曾幾何時紛紛以改組停辦聞矣雖其改組停辦之原因不一然至少不外才財兩難之一點因財之不足而設備因陋就簡才之不敷而有用違其長之弊辦理十年一無成就即在此耳淺識者流不明所以失敗之原因轉而責「職業敎育」之無當一般畏難敷衍之行政當局更利用此機會而藏拙職業敎育」在此五年中乃真不爲人所注重「職業敎育」蒙此不白之寃是誠大不幸矣</p>
<p>辦敎育難辦職業敎育尤難爲人人所共認惟其尤難故鮮有人敢辦辦亦鮮有成效者是蓋辦理之難與夫辦理不得其法之故與職業敎育無預焉辦職業敎育之難難在要有相當之設備專門之敎授如工則需工廠農則需農塲商則亦需適當之實習塲所其他學校設備可以因陋就簡而職業學校萬不可缺漏不全敎授亦須有專才擔任不但要有敎授明晰之才且須有實際經騐之能質言之不但能「敎」而且能「做」此又較諸普通學校爲難者絶對不可遷就也其他如設置之標準敎材之選擇實習之方式出路之推廣訓練之方針敎學之方法等均可謂「前無師承」在在需有精密之調查詳細之研究故須有充分之準備一方面造就師資一方面寛籌經費而後令出維行行必有效否則一經大部提創全國飈然風從二十年度起風氣所趨各校將一變昔日紛紛改職業爲普通者轉而紛紛改普通爲職業矣勢必有任意改組漫無標準者則將來之内容必將徒有其名而無其實行見蹈從前甲乙種實業學校之覆轍從使「職業敎育」再蒙不白之寃重違敎育部諸公提創之熱誠豈吾人所願聞哉</p>
<p>是故吾人於歡欣鼓押之餘竊願敎育行政當局與夫實際辦學諸君對於設置職業學校或改組職業學校至少要注意左之各點</p>
<p>一適應學校之環境而設科</p>
<p>一估量學校之經濟能力而設備</p>
<p>一先求適當之敎師</p>
<p>一預計將來之出路</p>
<p>一調查附近之社會狀况</p>
<p>一力求職業界之聯絡</p>
<p>一要有充分實習之塲所</p>
<p>至於訓練方針實習方式敎材選擇敎學方法等雖敎育部巳有設計委員將來必爲良模可資則效然亦須因地因時制宜不可不隨時隨地加以研究也我更有鄭重聲明者我之爲此言實本愛護職業敎育切望職業敎育之誠意希望學校當局决勿因吾言而畏葸因噎而廢食念「職業敎育」爲解决目前民生社會之唯一方法爲刻不容緩之嚴重問題努力奮門爲敎育界闢出一條新路豈惟敎育前途之幸國家社會實利賴之</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>回仍過佳利廟之前面乃見有數木架有多人執羊而祭之懸羊於架上以刀分爲二段血流滿地而其旁有牛安臥且有人獻花於牛前昔孟子云牛羊何擇焉今觀印度敎却大有所擇以牛爲聖而獻花以羊爲牲而殺之蓋有幸有不幸與雖然彼以爲羊無用而牛有功也牛者勞工之代表也故神聖之亦宜</p>
<p>四圍多售雜物及佳利畫像者余請印友選購若干頁并將請其說明以解釋印度之神話哲學但行道時屢感乞丐包圍之苦統計此廟周圍不下乞丐一二百人以上較上海城隍廟之乞丐爲多記中國之乞丐出産地北平等地尤盛石家莊車站一排至數十人余到灤州去經小巿乞丐亦成羣託而斯太云俄國莫斯科之乞丐又編成一旅不知今俄國赤化以後平民生活何如也又不知吾國北方經革命以後乞丐之數何如願有力者注意及之</p>
<p>回過印度博物院余曾游之但聞美術館亦附此間特再由其門而入見各種造像畫像甚多觀印度人像有與埃及猶太回敎各國丰度相近者其人態度偉大而近於自然女人之面均作圓滿狀中國人畫像以稍近於長方而下頣略瘦以表秀氣印人殊豐腴但畫上如此事實上未必然也有一女神造像正在用獅以吃魔旁侍有兩女童云是其女一彈琴爲司音樂之神一執一物云爲司財富之神又下侍有兩男云是其子一管軍隊一管他事云此女神即佳利所以保護萬民與魔戰勝也故印度人民崇拜之余見同爲印度敎宗而男佛克利須那之白樓寺清凈如彼罕見雜人而女神之廟擁擠不能揷足亦足見信仰之易於流行女神易普遍因其偏於情感故也</p>
<p>二十三日英國律師木克巳P.　P.　Mookeje約余訪一拉查拉查者印度之藩王也英統治印度百餘年昔日小藩王猶在聞全境小王有數十之多尚據疆土足以保存其富家翁之勢力云尚有兵若干此間樂不思蜀只留安樂公之位而巳但其富之勢力仍甚大聞數十百萬之富者不少英國長於政治法律寛大不過如少水之魚逐漸减少而巳小王住旅店中年甚幼能英語年二十歲如童也談吐文雅若游内地可到其國游觀也</p>

<h3 id="c317">一個青年的供狀 <a href="#c317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— 鐵華</p>
<p>與其說是「一個青年的供狀」不如直截的說是「我的供狀」因爲我也是青年中的一個我的公開狀寫來也許和一般青年相彷佛</p>
<p>我今年巳經二十三歲當我寫到這二十三的幾個字時我心裏真是說不出的羞憤手裏的筆也頓覺得異常沉重似乎不願我在這白紙上留着這樣墨跡公開的向人說我巳二十三歲有時我獨自沉思的當兒我終自以爲自巳的面孔還是很血潤很英俊正像柳梢堆滿着的青春一樣可愛於是想到這裏我的眉兒不自主的要幾度擠動目光格外睜得銳利些腦海裏便映起一個少年英雄英姿俊發躍馬横弓的氣概來然而照到案頭的鏡子摸着頷下開始挺硬的鬍根我惘然若失想起我是畢竟二十三歲的人了</p>
<p>想起我的身世自巳覺得太孤苦可憐然而我是不願人家怎樣的可憐我雖則幾年來憂患曾經什麽悲歡離合的塵世榨淔都稍得嘗過但是想到翻開中外古今的史錄誰個幸福從平凡裏飛到誰個事業在歡娱中完成忝爲世界上人類的一員原是爲了爲人而來的尤其是爲人類而幹的我終自靜思覺得我能夠到這孤苦的地步還是我的萬幸過去的重疊的創痕真是象徵着未來事業的偉大這種偉大的事業正是都要在一創一疤中掙扎來的目前的苦難的環境也便是阻止我墮落的　　非但是束縛着我不容墮落正需要我努力向上爬去升到光明之塔所以終是怎樣困苦連買書吃飯的錢時要恐慌我一顆微弱的心還是澎騰着熱血不允許自巳走到消極之路親友們勗勉我者甚深而我自負者亦很大</p>
<p>我雖則現在也混着一羣大學生的隊伍裏并且要攫上一個學士銜也似乎不久的年頭了只是平心而講我的程度是否合於我的年級我終覺得還應加一個疑問的符號但我對於學校給我的影象却還有很不滿的懷念最切的是敎授和學生離得太遠雖則敎授們也爲了生活的需索不得不東奔西走應付各方而學生們費了多大的費用實際上得到了幾許的學識關於這點我終要自巳省責太看重了形式的一個頭銜不能真正刻苦的自求恐怕我的弊病正犯在知而不行一方面終能自勵一方面時露自暴自棄的馬脚</p>
<p>我的愛好文藝或者和其他青年一樣一嚮太少鑑賞力只是亂塗濫寫希望着自巳成功一個偉大的作家這樣南轅北轍的盲目地幹那裏會有成功的一天呢儘是崇拜着歌德懷念着拜侖夢想着杜加納夫有什麽用錦繡般的口可以造成肚子裏還是擾得五臓六腑没有清楚這樣崇拜只怕許多大文豪死得要喊着倒霉呢</p>
<p>我的修養力實在太錯不學無術而先沾染到的種種習氣却不時會發作想怎樣浪漫一下怎樣狂放一番怎樣才顯得人生的偉大有時乃沉醉着醇酒有時要狂抽着香烟種種我明知要妨礙到我的前進綫上然而明知之而一再故犯之</p>
<p>性的問題在年齡上我很需要的了所以很同情着若谷君的「異性的饑渴」另一方面雖則明知道學業未成有待於努力的各方正多着但是戀愛的漩渦中我會不自主地很命的鑽進惟恐其落伍一般雖然青年人的心裏誰個不想有一個體面些的異性伴侣只是經騐告訴我理想要歸到失望原是人生是複雜的是多方面問題交織的一個大網有愛必有憎有甜必有苦真的能相互了解的有幾呢所謂隔膜還永留着人們間啊誰都是這樣說事業的發展正有待於努力何必戀戀於愛的苦悶中而忘了自巳的前程呢真的我何嘗不是這樣想然而不久會看到對我說這樣話的人自巳也會讚進了這一套戲法中去我真不明白究竟是怎樣一個詩之謎了現在我立誓着我不再談什麽愛我不願再受這種庸人自擾的痛苦我真的唯一的專力於學業的進展希望如此但願不再背我的誓言</p>
<p>一切歸納起來我却同樣像朋友們一樣終是經濟問題困厄着我若非朋友的慷慨借給我學費我連一個學生的座位也擠不着好久但是孤零生活是早巳在我預料之中我早巳說過並不值得怎樣自傷記得去年有過這樣的宣誓「我將永遠忘掉過去的悲哀不值得追維往事任西北風吹得我肉體發抖却未曾吹懈我的筋骨絲毫任肚子餓得灌些河水充饑與我的意志未曾有半點退縮我將鍜鍊我勞苦的筋骨努力走向完成學業的棘途端待中華民族需要我的時候……只是一年的過去我慚愧有負了這些誓言啊</p>
<p>毋庸諱言我的失敗完全在我的虚浮上期待着未來的光明未使不是一句漂亮的話兒我從今知道期待着的光明應當怎樣攫取非但怎樣攫取還應努力地開始攫取</p>
<p>我主觀地寫這許多話實在還未盡我的萬一在這公開狀上未免留着許多缺陷不過做一個追隨年青的朋友們一同努力前進的左劵而已</p>

<p>Although yesterday was Sunday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry continued its deliberations on legal rights negotiations with China. Foreign Minister Shidehara arrived at the Minister's office early in the morning, and Vice Minister Nagai, Treaty Bureau Director Matsuda, Envoy Shigemitsu, Asian Affairs Bureau Director Shiratori, Information Bureau Director, and other key figures attended the meeting to discuss the principles and policies of Japan's legal rights issue, the basic proposal for legal rights negotiations, and the timing and method of legal rights negotiations. As a result, a concrete draft was prepared based on Envoy Shigemitsu's report. The draft will be further refined and revised at today's meeting and then submitted by Foreign Minister Shidehara to the Cabinet meeting on the 28th for approval. Envoy Shigemitsu will then bring it to China on the 29th to begin concrete negotiations with Foreign Minister Wang. Although the content is being kept strictly secret, it is said to be based on Envoy Shigemitsu's on-the-ground report, and after three deliberations, it appears that the Foreign Ministry's previous policy on the legal rights issue has been significantly revised.

<p>The Control Yuan Announces the Impeachment Case of Chen Diaoyuan</p>
<p>Requests the National Government to Transfer for Disciplinary Action</p>
<p>Abolish Salt, Rice, Tobacco, and Miscellaneous Taxes</p>
<h3 id="e8">Nanjing <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The Control Yuan announced the original text of the impeachment case of Chen Diaoyuan on the 27th, stating: "Submitting the case for impeachment according to law. According to the report submitted by Control Committee members Zhou Lisheng, Gao Yihan, and Wang Pingzheng, the Anhui Provincial Government has disregarded the Central Government's orders regarding the salt and rice tax levies, failing to instruct local bureaus to uniformly cease collection. Moreover, it has arbitrarily used military force to forcibly collect taxes, resulting in the tragic incident of opening fire, killing merchants, and a complete market strike by all businesses. The provincial government's responsible personnel have repeatedly defied central government orders and inflicted great suffering on the people. Therefore, we should initiate impeachment according to Article 2 of the Impeachment Law and, according to Article 7 of the Impeachment Law, first request the National Government to issue urgent relief measures, ordering the provincial government to immediately abolish the salt and rice taxes to uphold the law and comply with public opinion."</p>
<p>"Also, according to the reports submitted by Control Committee members Liu San and Zhou Jue, since Anhui Provincial Chairman Chen Diaoyuan took office, he has increased the supplementary tax on salt and rice in northern and southern Anhui, leading to the prevalence of smuggling and causing the people to lack food. He has also arbitrarily imposed export rice and grain passport fees, which are almost double the previous levies collected by the likin bureaus. Recently, thousands of rice boats along the Huai River were detained and forcibly levied. Huaiyuan merchants petitioned and complained, but the collection officials ordered the opening of fire, injuring many. Bengbu City has gone on strike as a result. Furthermore, military police inspection offices have been established in various ports along the Yangtze River, such as Anqing, Wuhu, Datong, and Hezhou, to collect opium taxes and issue tobacco licenses. He has also secretly ordered county magistrates to force the people to grow tobacco. All of the above is based on petitions from the citizens of Anhui. Chen Diaoyuan, as a high-ranking official, should abide by the law, but he has defied orders to impose exorbitant taxes after the abolition of likin, and openly bought and sold during the ban on opium. The facts are clear, public grievances are boiling, and the entire Anhui is in turmoil. Without disciplinary action, others will inevitably follow suit. Therefore, according to Article 2 of the Impeachment Law, we hereby impeach him. We request a prompt investigation and referral for disciplinary action to uphold the law and relieve the people's suffering."</p>
<p>"We appointed Control Committee members Yu Hongqi, Xiao Xuan, and Liu Chengyu to conduct an investigation. Now, according to the report from the committee members, they received the impeachment case of Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of Anhui Province, filed by Liu San and Zhou Jue, for defying orders to impose exorbitant taxes after the abolition of likin, and openly buying and selling during the ban on opium, secretly ordering county residents to grow tobacco and collect taxes. They also received the impeachment case filed by Committee members Zhou Lisheng, Gao Yihan, and Wang Pingzheng against the Anhui Provincial Government for newly adding supplementary salt taxes and rice passport fees, failing to comply with explicit orders to abolish them, and recently dispatching troops to forcibly collect them, detaining salt and rice boats, and even opening fire, injuring boatmen and inciting a merchant strike. The committee members combined the two cases for investigation and unanimously believe that the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government has disregarded the Central Government's orders regarding the salt and rice tax levies, failing to instruct local bureaus to uniformly cease collection. Moreover, it has arbitrarily used military force to forcibly collect taxes, resulting in the tragic incident of opening fire, killing boatmen and merchants, and a complete market strike by all businesses. He has further collected opium taxes in various ports, openly buying and selling, issuing tobacco licenses, and secretly ordering counties to force residents to grow tobacco and collect seedling taxes, and heavily taxing land. Such defiance of the law and disorder not only prevents the implementation of the Central Government's policy of abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies but also fundamentally undermines the Central Government's plans for unified finances and the implementation of opium prohibition. In addition to requesting the National Government to transfer for disciplinary action according to law, we should also first request the National Government to take urgent relief measures, ordering the provincial government to immediately abolish the salt and rice taxes, opium land taxes, tobacco licenses, permits, seedling cultivation taxes, etc., to uphold the law and comply with public opinion, which would be in the public interest."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, regarding the eleven cases of accusations against Chen Diaoyuan in the original impeachment case, they have been reviewed in detail in conjunction with the impeachment case and should be copied and submitted to the National Government for reference when handing over for disciplinary action."</p>
<p>"Investigation reveals that Article 7 of the Impeachment Law states that if a public official's illegal behavior is related to the people's lives and property and is of a serious nature, the Control Committee members may file an impeachment case and transfer it to the disciplinary agency and may also simultaneously submit it to the National Government or notify the responsible supervisor for urgent relief measures. Since the Control Committee members have investigated this case and believe that it should be transferred for disciplinary action and that urgent relief measures should be taken first, it should be handled according to law. We hereby respectfully submit copies of the committee members' impeachment submissions and the original documents of the local people's accusations to Your Excellency for review and urgently issue relief measures according to law, ordering the provincial government to immediately abolish the increased salt, rice, tobacco, and miscellaneous taxes in the province to rectify officialdom and alleviate the people's suffering." (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Nanjing <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Office of the National Government replied to the Control Yuan, stating: "Respectfully informing you that the Control Yuan submitted reports from Control Committee members Zhou Lisheng et al. and Liu San et al., stating that since Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, took office, he has increased the salt and rice tax fees, leading to a major incident, and also collected land taxes, issued tobacco licenses and permits, and forced the people to grow tobacco, which was impeached according to law. The case was jointly reviewed by Control Committee members Yu Hongqi et al., who reported that disciplinary action should be taken and that urgent relief measures should be taken first. We requested your review and orders to immediately abolish the salt, rice, tobacco, and other exorbitant taxes and levies to rectify officialdom and alleviate the people's suffering."</p>
<p>"Having received the National Government's telegram to the Chairman, it stated that the salt tax surcharges and export rice passport fees levied in Anhui Province had previously been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be abolished within a specified period. However, according to complaints from all parties, they have not yet been complied with. There are also reports of military police inspection offices being established in various ports along the Yangtze River to collect opium taxes, issue tobacco licenses, and secretly order counties to force the people to grow tobacco. If this is true, it is in great contradiction to the central government's policies. In addition to having previously handed over the case to the Executive Yuan for investigation, we hereby urgently order you to comply and promptly report within five days whether the salt and rice taxes in the province have been abolished, whether the opium tax is being collected, whether the people are being forced to grow tobacco, and the handling of matters after receiving the order, so that we can verify the situation. This order is imperative." In response to this, we have recorded the telegram and sent it for your review. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e33">The British Census <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The census is one of the most important political undertakings of a nation. In peacetime, it can provide information about the increase and decrease of the national population, and all policies related to the people's livelihood rely on accurate surveys for their implementation. In times of emergency, it also requires assistance from the census for identifying criminals, suppressing bandits, arresting offenders, and providing disaster relief. Therefore, all countries attach great importance to this undertaking.</p>
<p>According to today's Reuters telegram, the streets of London presented a strange sight after midnight last night. Police officers with census forms searched everywhere for homeless people to avoid any omissions in the national ten-year population statistics. Those sleeping on benches on the Thames River embankment and those staying in the Salvation Army's shelters were all included. It was also reported that the statistics included at least one suspected murderer awaiting trial. It was also reported that a girl was born at Charing Cross Hospital fifteen seconds before midnight and was also included in the statistics.</p>
<p>We do not know what the purpose of this sudden large-scale survey in London at night is, but we can see the strictness and sensitivity of the British survey method. Anyone who commits a crime will have difficulty hiding and escaping the law. We say that after the suppression of bandits in various parts of China, clearing the villages is being organized, and the most important thing in clearing the villages is the census. After the bandits are defeated and scattered, they can hide anywhere. If there is no sudden and urgent investigation and strict search like the British census, it will be difficult to clear the local bandits. Our country's census has always been regarded as a routine matter. If we still treat it perfunctorily and negligently as before in the suppression of bandits, such as with the Baojia system and house numbers, the actual effect of clearing the villages will probably not be easily achieved.</p>

<p>At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' memorial week ceremony on the morning of the 27th, Wang Zhengting reported that substantial progress had been made in the negotiations on legal rights. Norway has formally exchanged documents, the Netherlands has signed a draft treaty, and Brazil has no problems at all, awaiting the arrival of the Brazilian ambassador to Nanjing to negotiate the signing. The attitudes of the United Kingdom and the United States are also clear, and it can be said that 95% has been accomplished. The United Kingdom and the United States should be able to resolve the specifics within one or two days. Currently, only France is still hesitating and has not made any sincere expression. Since the founding of the Republic, France has shown goodwill towards China. During these twenty years, France has consistently expressed sympathy and support for all of China's revolutionary movements based on its friendly attitude. Recently, it is unknown what constraints it has been under, but it has consistently maintained an unclear attitude towards China's most reasonable demands. This is truly regrettable. It is deeply hoped that France will maintain its friendly attitude towards China over the past twenty years and decisively renounce its consular jurisdiction in China, thereby enhancing Sino-French relations. Wang also stated that the most important task of this National Assembly is to formulate a constitution. In the future, not only should the Chinese people abide by it, but all foreign nationals residing in China should also abide by it. After the establishment of the constitution, in order to ensure the integrity of its sovereignty, the Chinese government will no longer tolerate the existence of an illegal system of consular jurisdiction. All foreigners in China only need to abide by Chinese law, and their legal treatment will be the same as that of Chinese citizens, with absolutely no discrimination. It is hoped that foreigners in China will deeply understand this point. (Special dispatch of the 27th)</p>

<p>Fu Shuangying took office as Director of the Jingxing Mining Bureau on the 27th and told reporters that previous directors had all acted like officials, and even if there was a surplus, it was used for other purposes. After I take office, I will act as the manager of a business company, and if there is a surplus, it will be used to develop the business and will never be used for other purposes. The Jingxing Mine is more than ten li away from the Zhengtai Railway, and transportation is difficult. I have decided to build a branch line directly to the mine. It is heard that the mining area is very rich in oil, and I have decided to hire technicians to enter the mountain to explore. In the future, the extracted kerosene and gasoline will not only block loopholes but also open up a huge source of wealth for the country. Everyone knows that Kailuan produces a lot of coal, but over the past twenty years, I don't know how many millions of Chinese money have flowed into the United Kingdom. This is truly heartbreaking and shameful. I will definitely use all my strength to develop the Jingxing business in the future, and I hope the press will promote and assist.

<p>The Linsi miners of Kailuan Mine once demanded improved treatment by going on strike, but this has not been resolved. The Kailuan General Labor Union has submitted a request to the Mining Bureau for wage increases. The reason is that the price of Kailuan coal has recently increased by 40 cents per ton, and the daily production of coal is more than 20,000 tons, an increase of more than 8,000 yuan per day. The total number of workers is more than 30,000, and the increase per person per day is 20 cents, leaving more than 2,000 yuan. The conditions for the wage increase are three items, the types of work that should be improved are ten items, and the existing treatment that should be improved is seven items. It is stated that a satisfactory response must be given within one week, otherwise, they will go on strike. (Special dispatch of the 27th)</p>

<p>The prospects for the Anglo-Franco-Italian naval agreement are becoming increasingly pessimistic. The British reply was delivered to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. It does not agree with the explanations proposed by France and rejects France's new proposal to replace the tonnage of old warships, arguing that this issue should be resolved when the London Naval Treaty is revised in 1935. According to semi-official news, Italy's attitude is also unacceptable to the French proposal. The reply is expected to be sent out on Wednesday or Thursday. Currently, the attitudes of the United Kingdom and Italy are the same. If France does not make some concessions, Henderson's efforts to mediate between the two countries over the past few months may be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>The Special Committee of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, which is drafting a formal treaty based on the draft Franco-Italian Naval Agreement, has been continuing to meet at the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs since the 15th of this month. When the Committee was deliberating, France raised a substitution requirement that conflicted with the Washington Treaty, and the meeting almost came to a standstill. The British and Italian members telegraphed their respective governments for instructions. Today, the British government finally replied to France, the content of which stated that it could not agree with France's interpretation of the substitution clauses in the basic Franco-Italian Naval Agreement, and that it was difficult to approve France's calculation of the tonnage to be abandoned and its proposal for substitution, clearly expressing its opposition. Today, the Italian government also opposed the French proposal in the same way as the United Kingdom, saying that the French interpretation ran counter to the agreements of the Washington Treaty and could not be recognized at all. It was decided to formally reply to the French government in one or two days. Observers who are pessimistic about the formal establishment of the Franco-Italian Agreement have gradually gained strength. If France does not change its attitude, the deliberations of the Special Committee cannot proceed, and the meeting may have to be suspended temporarily.</p>

<p>Former French Prime Minister Herriot, after negotiating with the Socialist Party, was re-elected Mayor of Lyon today by a vote of 39 to 0. Eleven people did not vote. Herriot served as Mayor of Lyon for 25 years. He resigned a month ago because the Socialist Party won a landslide victory in the primary election for senators in the Rhône department. In today's re-election for mayor, Herriot initially received 26 votes, a majority of only two votes. Herriot was unwilling to take office because he wanted to have a majority of left-wing votes in order to govern the city. In the second vote, all but eleven people voted for Herriot.</p>

<p>The dispute between Japan and Russia over the fishing zone issue can be said to have been largely resolved due to the compromise on the ruble exchange rate. However, in order to fundamentally resolve the problem, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to continue to revise the following aspects: 1. The issue of fishing in state-operated fishing zones; 2. The issue of tariffs on goods necessary for fishing; 3. The issue of the minimum price for bidding on leased areas; 4. Restrictions on net construction; and other fisheries treaties. It also plans to begin negotiations with Russia immediately. However, it will take some time to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>Regarding the ruble exchange rate issue and the attitude of Japanese fishing companies, the Director of the Sakhalin Russian Fisheries Association, Kabayama, issued a statement yesterday afternoon outlining the main points, saying: "The Japanese Fisheries Association will, of course, comply with the agreement on the ruble exchange rate reached between the Japanese and Russian governments. When the Fisheries Association agrees to this exchange rate, it will be a prerequisite for resolving various outstanding issues between Japan and Russia. I believe that the Japanese government will subsequently strive for a fundamental and specific solution to the fishing zone issue."</p>

<p>The main points of Prime Minister Wakatsuki's instructions at today's local governors' conference are as follows: "The financial and economic policies of the current cabinet are fundamentally the same as those of the previous cabinet. The main objectives are financial austerity and re-establishment of the financial world in order to deal with the aftermath of the gold embargo. Our financial world has improved significantly since around August and September of last year, but it still requires the concerted efforts of the government and the people to fundamentally reorganize. The government will simultaneously implement three major reorganizations of administration, finance, and taxation in order to promote the rationalization of state affairs and the fairness of the burden on the people. The main reason for the current global recession is the imbalance between production and consumption. Japan is no exception. Therefore, Japan should promote the improvement of production methods, garment factory management organizations, and establish a foundation for industrial prosperity. At this time, we should devote more effort to its research and implementation. In addition, promoting agriculture and forestry, improving social policies, relieving unemployment, and guiding thought are all major issues that require the most effort. I hope that you will cooperate with the central and local governments to ensure that these policies are fully implemented."</p>

<p>The following is the content of Foreign Minister Shidehara's foreign policy speech at the local governors' conference: "The Republic of China is currently exerting all its efforts in political construction, and it is fully understandable that it desires to restore its national rights. It is regrettable that there are often unfounded theories that seek to create rifts in Sino-Japanese relations. The government will conduct Sino-Japanese negotiations reasonably based on genuine understanding. Regarding the Mongolian issue, although some people in both China and Japan hold assertive views, I believe that China will be able to clearly recognize Japan's position in Manchuria and conduct negotiations. Next, I will talk about the Russian fishing zone issue and general international issues. I hope that all localities will make every effort to consider and facilitate the Chinese inspection delegation."</p>

The police also paid attention to the two churches in London that accommodate hundreds of poor people every night. At least one murder suspect awaiting trial was included in this census. In addition, a girl born at Charing Cross Hospital, just 15 seconds before midnight, was also included in the statistics.</p>

<p>Chaplin, who is very popular in mainland China, went to Africa, separated by only a strip of water, to admire the scenery of Algiers. Unexpectedly, he suddenly suffered a stroke, and one leg became lame, resembling the appearance of his film roles. He returned to France today, so the plan to come to the East via Moscow may be postponed. His arrival in Japan will probably be after the cherry blossoms have fallen, or he may only be able to admire the autumn leaves of Kyoto and Nara. After returning to France, he will go to the Riviera and plans to recuperate there for three months. It is said that he will produce a large film with mainland China as the stage during his stay in France, but whether this is true is kept extremely secret.</p>

<p>Central and National Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>Zeng Yangfu reports on the inspection of Hunan and Hubei</p>
<p>Dai Chuanxian reports on the handling of national elections</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters</p>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on the 27th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 109th weekly memorial service for the Premier. Central Committee members Yu Youren, Zeng Yangfu, Chen Lifu, Liu Jiwen, Cheng Tianfang, Zhang Daofan, and other officials from various departments and committees, totaling five to six hundred people, attended. Yu Youren presided. After the ceremony, Zeng Yangfu reported on his inspection of Hunan and Hubei, stating briefly that the Party affairs in Hunan and Hubei had been controlled by the Communist Party and disrupted by the reorganization faction. People generally thought it would not be good, but the inspection results were not so. The ideology was unified from division, the action was organized from scatteredness, the mentality was constructive from destructive, and the work was sincere from superficiality. Party members were self-restrained and humble from self-satisfaction and pride, so there was a lot of progress. But there were two mistakes that should be corrected: 1. Speaking for the Party and disregarding the people. 2. Only knowing how to blame others and not knowing how to examine oneself. If reforms can be made, there are many ways to improve. The Communist Party in the two provinces is already surrounded and will soon be completely eliminated. The Three Principles of the People have penetrated the hearts of the people, and the future is very optimistic. Regarding the improvement of Party affairs, there are three points: 1. The Central Government should guide the direction of efforts of lower-level Party headquarters. 2. Attention should be paid to the selection of Party affairs personnel. 3. The Party should be strengthened. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<p>At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the National Government held the weekly memorial service for the Premier. Chiang Kai-shek, Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Shao Lizi, He Yaozu, Wang Zhengting, Ma Fuxiang, Liu Shangqing, Niu Yongjian, Wang Shuhan, Bao Wenxue, and officials, totaling three hundred people, attended. Chiang Kai-shek presided. After the ceremony, Dai Chuanxian reported on the progress of the national elections, stating briefly that as of the 26th, representatives from seventeen provinces and five municipalities had already departed, and the rest were in the process of elections and could arrive before the meeting. The election order was very good, and the representatives were very organized, which was rare. The first task of the National Assembly is to unify people's hearts. It is hoped that all representatives will sincerely accept all of the Premier's teachings and voluntarily and freely decide on the overall plan for unifying the country and building the country. The General Office will be closed at the end of the month, and the unfinished business will be taken over by the Secretariat at the beginning of next month. After this election, the people should know that they must organize themselves from the bottom up in order to shoulder the responsibilities of the country. The report concluded and the ceremony adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Wang Shuhan and Bao Wenxue Take Office <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>National Government Committee member Wang Shuhan and Deputy Chief of General Staff Bao Wenxue took their oaths of office on the morning of the 27th after the National Government's weekly memorial service for the Premier. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the ceremony. Wang and Bao both raised their right hands and swore an oath. Central Committee member Cai Yuanpei supervised the oath and delivered an address, stating briefly that the Party comrades were very pleased that Wang and Bao were taking office today. The two comrades had worked hard in the Northeast for a long time and had made great contributions to the country. The nation-building process stipulated by the Party is divided into three periods: military administration, political tutelage, and constitutional government. Although it is now in the period of political tutelage, it is not yet the time for true peace. Great efforts must still be made in the military field. Wang and Bao have extraordinary military experience and are now serving in the Central Government. In the future, they will be able to make great contributions to the government in military construction and national defense planning based on their past experience. Then, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered an address, stating briefly that the government comrades had been looking forward to the arrival of Committee Member Wang and Deputy Chief Bao in Nanjing for a long time. The two had made considerable contributions to national unification, consolidating the national foundation, and convening the National Assembly. It is hoped that after taking office, they will work with the government comrades with one heart and one mind to complete the mission of the revolution through political tutelage. Next, Wang Shuhan replied, stating briefly that he had no talent and had not made any contributions to the Party and the country, so he did not dare to take office rashly. However, since he had been appointed by the government, he would do his best and hoped that the advanced members of the Party and the country would give him guidance at any time. After taking office, he will embrace loyalty and strive for the Party and the country. Next, Bao Wenxue replied that he would respectfully accept the instructions of the oath supervisor and commander-in-chief, be loyal to the Party and the country, and strive in his position to live up to the expectations of the commander-in-chief and the oath supervisor. After the reply, music was played and the ceremony concluded.</p>

<p>Remnant Bandits Flee in Two Directions</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The bandit forces at Baodugang have been greatly weakened after being surrounded and suppressed by various armies. Han Fuju has returned to Jinan and left Chief of Staff Li Zongbi in Lincheng to command. Division Commander Sun Tongxuan has also arrived in Tengxian to supervise the troops. Wang Jun has sent Brigade Commander Li Wenbin to Lincheng to command the 70th Regiment of the Railway Protection Force, Chen Chuanwen's troops, and the troops of Han, Ma, and Chen to jointly attack the mountain. Yesterday, the Jinpu Garrison Headquarters received a report from the front lines stating that Baodugang had been occupied by the 26th Division. The remnant bandits who fled to the northeast were blocked and suppressed by the Han army, and those who fled to the southwest were intercepted by the 7th Division. The original report is as follows: (1) Chen Chuanwen telegram: Urgent, Jinpu Garrison Commander Wang Jun: There are no traces of bandits in the vicinity of the area under the jurisdiction of my regiment, and the area is very peaceful. I respectfully report the situation as follows: 1. According to the report of my regiment's attached regiment leader Luo, the main force of the bandits has no resistance and has fled to the northeast. 2. Leopard Mountain, that is, Baodugang, has been occupied by two regiments of my 26th Division, and all houses in the bandit area have been burned down. 3. The fugitive bandits captured in recent days have been sent to the county government for custody, and the local population is being cleared in Zaozhuang. 4. Many old people, children, and women who have fled from the bandit area have come to Zaozhuang in recent days. They have now joined local groups to donate funds and establish a refugee relief association to provide shelter. Chen Chuanwen bows. (2) Lincheng telegram: At 7:00 a.m. this morning, 80 to 90 bandits were discovered in Xiaohanzhuang, more than 20 li east of Hanzhuang. They were first intercepted by the local militia, and then the 7th company of the 41st Regiment stationed in Han was dispatched to suppress them. At 12:00 noon on the same day, hundreds of bandits with more than 100 guns were discovered in the Huangluoshan Guojiacun area northeast of Lincheng. Two companies of the 41st Regiment stationed in Lincheng were dispatched to assist the militia in surrounding and attacking them, and they carried one machine gun and one mortar each to strengthen their forces. The bandits in both places are now being encircled and suppressed by our army. Our senior officers believe that these bandits are fleeing from Baodugang, are exhausted, and are trying to escape to the south. They are now ordering their troops to strictly encircle and suppress them. (26th)</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The bandits in the southern Shandong area have still been intercepted by the army in various directions in recent days.

<h3 id="e123">Songhua River Downstream Merchants Oppose Joint Shipping <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Demands the Cancellation of the Joint Shipping General Bureau</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: This year, the Songhua River shipping merchants, in order to maintain business and avoid competition among the same industry, have united to develop externally. They have submitted a request to the Northeast authorities to organize the Northeast Shipping Merchants Joint Business General Bureau. The inaugural meeting was held on March 15, and the bureau was established and began operating on April 15. More than 250 official and merchant ships have joined, and the bureau has as many as 254 employees. At the beginning of its establishment, the bureau was afraid that various parties would not understand the truth, so it issued a declaration stating that after the joint shipping, it would open up the upstream shipping route, regain international shipping rights, support the agricultural products along the river, and expand the water and land transportation routes. It also stated that it would never monopolize shipping affairs and would never increase freight rates. After the declaration was issued, the towns and villages, farmers, merchants, and Harbin municipal chambers of commerce related to the Songhua River shipping industry did not express any opinion. The bureau then planned to open the upstream shipping route with six ships on April 22, and coordinate water and land transportation with the Taoang Road. On the 25th, it would open the downstream shipping route to Yilan. All ship voyages have been arranged. Unexpectedly, in the past week, 14 counties downstream, such as Fujin, Huachuan, Tongjiang, and Yilan, telegraphed the Special Zone Administrative Chief's Office and the Binjiang Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting them to inform the Shipping Joint Bureau to cancel the organization to avoid monopolizing the industry and raising freight rates. They also stated that if the goal of canceling the bureau was not achieved, they would not come to Harbin to purchase goods or ship grain and stones to Harbin after the river opened to show their resistance. According to the telegram, the Chief's Office has forwarded the information to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for review. The Binjiang Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened 27 groups related to import and export goods on the 21st of this month to discuss countermeasures. The representatives present all said that the downstream counties would not come to purchase goods or sell local products to Harbin. Regardless of whether the reasons for opposing the Shipping Joint Bureau are justified, the long-term stalemate is related to the Harbin merchants. It was decided to telegraph the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, the Beiping Military Command Deputy Commander Zhang, the Jilin Provincial Chairman Zhang Zuoxiang, and send a fast letter to the Special Zone Chief's Office requesting them to order the Shipping Joint Bureau to cancel the organization to avoid the downstream merchants from adhering to their prejudices and affecting the Harbin merchants' business. It is difficult to predict the outcome. However, in the past, the goods waiting to be transported at the riverside docks before the river opened were piled up. Now, due to the downstream merchants' opposition to the joint shipping, there are no goods waiting to be transported on the riverside. The Shipping Joint Bureau is still proceeding step by step while waiting for the official approval. However, the freight rates are planned to be slightly reduced to appease the opposition of the downstream merchants. It is said that the downstream merchants' opposition to the joint shipping is rooted in excessive selfishness. In the past, there was competition between official and merchant ships, and the freight rates often had rebates. The brokers benefited a lot from this. Now that the ships are united, the freight rates have regulations, and the handling of affairs is standardized, the rebates are naturally difficult to expect. In addition, they are afraid that the freight rates will be raised in the future, which will be detrimental to the transportation of passengers and goods, so they unanimously opposed the organization.

<p>Zhang Zuoxiang Returns to Jilin to Urge Progress</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The five Jilin Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee members Zhang Zuoxiang, Lin Changsheng, Shi Jiuling, Chen Shiying, and Gu Gengye were sworn in on the 26th of last month in Shenyang, together with the committee members from Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Harbin. The remaining two members, Xi Qia and Han Qingyun, were sworn in on the 2nd of this month when Wu Tiecheng came to Jilin. The Jilin Provincial Party Headquarters was thus established. However, due to the fact that it was in the early stages of establishment, the preparations and arrangements were complicated. The Liaoning Provincial Party Affairs had already started working, and Jilin could not delay any longer. Therefore, Committee Members Lin, Shi, and Chen went to Liaoning one after another to consult with Zhang Zuoxiang to proceed with the work, taking the opportunity to learn from them nearby. When Zhang Xueliang entered the customs, Zhang Zuoxiang was originally ordered to stay in Liaoning to sit in town. However, because the Jilin Provincial Party Affairs urgently needed to start work, he returned to Jilin by special train at noon on the 19th. Here, only the Shenyang telephone report was received the next night, informing that Zhang had left that night and entrusted Zang Shiyi to act as agent for the affairs of Liaoning. When Zhang's special train arrived at the headquarters, all parties had already been notified and came to the Jiha Railway Station to welcome him. Zhang got out of the car and briefly socialized with the welcoming personnel, and then took a car back to the provincial government. Committee Members Lin and Shi also returned to Jilin together. Committee Member Chen stayed in Liaoning to discuss the preparations for the Party Headquarters. Committee Members Han, Lin, and Sheng have been responsible for handling all the organizational regulations, which have all been drafted. The provincial party headquarters will be established at the former site of the Jilin Provincial Assembly. It is heard that the monthly expenses are set at 10,000 yuan. (April 10th)</p>

<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: There is a BaisHan Mountain in the southwest eight li of Zhan Yuji, at the junction of Pixian and Suixian in Xuzhou. The mountain is not very high. Behind the mountain, there is a mound of about three mu. According to the elders, it is an ancient tomb, but it has been leveled to the ground after many years. In the middle of this month, the villagers were cultivating the land and felt that there were stones underground that were obstructing the work. They planned to remove the stone slab to facilitate planting. Unexpectedly, the stone slab was quite large, and it took half a day to move the stone slab away. A deep and large black hole was seen below. At that time, there were many onlookers. The bolder ones were lowered down to inspect. There was a stone room with east and west rooms. They held torches to illuminate it. The ground was quite clean. There were two stone pillars with carved double dragons. The craftsmanship was so exquisite that it was rarely seen in modern times. There was also a stone window lattice, and the workmanship was also exquisite. There were several ancient coins on the stone on the ground. When they were taken, they had become powdered. There was also a copper pot filled with clear water and a small magnetic bottle with two jade figures. Because there were many tourists, it was unknown who took them. The hole was about thirty feet deep. There was also a stone slab one or two feet from the ground on the back wall, which had been interrupted and looked quite deep. Good people poked it with a cane, and the sound was buzzing. They all thought that there were other antiques inside, but no one dared to move it. Now, there are dozens of tourists every day, and many people come from afar to explore. The Tongshan Library plans to send personnel within a few days to dig stones to investigate the antiquities for the sake of examining the antiquities. (25th)</p>

<h3 id="e127">The Public Telegraphs to Request Extending the Bandit Suppression Period <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Songjiang, Jinshan, Jiashan, and Pinghu Counties bandit suppression troops recently captured bandits He Erheshang, He Aqiu, Zhou Kaizhang, Zhou Agen, Zhou Changmin, etc. After investigation and interrogation, except for Zhou Changmin, who was found to be innocent and released, He Erheshang confessed to serving as a kidnapping agent under Taibao Ashu, and He Aqiu admitted to being a bandit under Zhu 　Amei. Zhou Kaizhang and others also admitted to it. Furthermore, more than ten citizens of Pinghu, including Jin Chengfan, jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang stating that Commander Cao's efforts to suppress bandits were quite diligent, but the headquarters was originally scheduled to end at the end of April. However, many remnant bandits, such as Lu Yaosheng, still escaped and entered the ocean, causing the people of the four counties to be deeply alarmed. They requested that the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces extend the headquarters for two months to ensure suppression.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Chefang Kidnapping Case, Extorting Huge Amounts of Money for Ransom <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Hu Daoxiang and his son Yuanjian, Zhu Xian, Ni, the daughter-in-law of Li Wanfang, Sun Arer and other five villagers from Hujiadang Township in Chefang were kidnapped by bandits on the morning of the 25th. After the bandits kidnapped the hostages, they set sail with more than a dozen ships to Taihu Lake and transferred to Wujiang. When the hostages were kidnapped, the bandits sent two threatening letters, one to Zhu Jinxuan in the township and one to Chen Zhongying, under the name of the first team leader of the World's First Army. In the threatening letters, they extorted 58,000 yuan from Zhu Jinxuan's family and 38,000 yuan from Chen Zhongying's family. Judging from the tone, they seemed to intend to kidnap hostages from the Zhu and Chen families, resulting in the mistaken kidnapping of Hu Daoxiang and others. After the bandits kidnapped the Hu family hostages and realized it was a misunderstanding, they first released Hu Daoxiang and ordered him to return and ask the Zhu and Chen families to prepare the money to redeem the hostages. It was set at 2:00 p.m. on the tenth day of the lunar month. A small flat-headed boat with a three-foot red cloth bamboo pole raised as a signal would meet at the Qianggangkouzi. Otherwise, your hostages will be beaten to death and beheaded without mercy. If the meeting is not successful, your houses will be burned down. After Hu Daoxiang returned home, he knew that his two sons were still in the bandit's den. Knowing that the bandits had been mistaken, he contacted the Zhu and Chen families and reported to the water and land police team to rush to suppress and rescue the hostages from danger. It is also learned that Shen District Chief of the Third District of the Water Public Security Department, according to the investigation report, yesterday (27th) specifically ordered the Eleventh, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Third Squadrons and guerrillas,</p>

<p>The home of Zhang Xiaodi, a resident of Xujia Lane near Zhangjing Bridge in the seventh district of the county (Huaishang City), was suddenly visited by more than 20 robbers wearing white headscarves, straw sandals, and carrying hunting guns, iron blunderbusses, iron rulers, and flashlights at about 10:00 p.m. the other night. They broke into the house. At that time, the Zhang family was asleep. After the robbers entered the room, they tied up Xiaodi and his son Anan with ropes and burned their lower parts to force them to reveal the whereabouts of the hidden silver. Then they overturned boxes and cabinets and searched arbitrarily. After about three hours, they left with the stolen goods. A total of sixteen silver dollars and about four hundred yuan worth of gold and silver jewelry were robbed. When the robbers were leaving, they also trampled on the silkworm eggs and then swarmed to the home of Li Peihe to commit robbery, resulting in a loss of more than five hundred yuan. Now the victims, Zhang Xiaodi and Li Peihe, have not reported to the authorities to request an arrest. Furthermore, the home of Gu Rongbing, a villager in Nanyang Hetou Township in the same district, was also visited by more than 20 robbers at about 11:00 p.m. last night. They burst into the house to commit robbery and stabbed Rongbing in the left ear with a bayonet, leaving a wound about half an inch long. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious. The robbers then carried out a large-scale robbery and fired a shot before leaving with the stolen goods. After the incident, it was checked that the loss was more than five hundred yuan. The injured Huang Rongbing was carried to a nearby Western doctor for treatment and there was no danger to his life.</p>

<p>The dyeing and weaving and knitting industries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces believe that the products of these factories are directly woven from cotton yarn. Since cotton yarn has already paid the consolidated tax, and the direct burden is borne by the dyeing and weaving and knitting industries, it seems that the business tax should not be levied again. However, the business tax rate in Jiangsu Province is still included in the levy, which is indeed a duplicate tax. They have convened meetings of the industry several times in Shanghai and Wuxi to petition the Ministry of Finance to abolish it, but it has not been approved. They have convened another general meeting and appointed Cheng Jingtang and Ge Zicai from Wuxi, Zhu Wenqi and Pan Xuhua from Shanghai, and representatives from Jiangyin, Wujin, and Changshu to go to Beijing yesterday to petition the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry.</p>

<p>All trade associations in the county, believing that the Provincial Government's resolution to levy business tax from April 1st, as ordered by the Finance Department, is unacceptable before the relevant regulations are amended by the Legislative Yuan, are resolved not to acknowledge and pay it. Therefore, at 2 p.m. on the 25th, a joint meeting was held at the silk and cloth association. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) Jointly telegraph the Central Yuan, ministries, and Jiangsu Provincial Department to appeal for instructions to postpone the collection; (2) Temporarily suspend the filling and submission of declaration forms; (3) Take measures to investigate, etc., and temporarily refuse. Furthermore, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Cotton Textile Industry Joint Association, believing that cotton weaving has already borne the cotton yarn consolidated tax as stipulated by the central government and should not be subject to business tax again, has initiated a joint effort by all trade associations in the cotton textile industries of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to petition the central ministries in Beijing to remove the cotton weaving industry from the business tax regulations and exempt it from taxation.

<h3 id="e153">Attention That Should Be Paid to the Advocacy of Vocational Education by Yang Weiyu <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>"Backward social production and people's livelihood difficulties" are indeed the current situation in our country, and what is most regrettable is the increasing number of graduates from schools who are unemployed in society. These people are scattered in society, their knowledge and desires have surpassed ordinary people, but they do not have any specialized skills. They aspire to climb high but have no means to make a living. They are filled with sorrow, and society is wary of them. This phenomenon is a hidden concern for the future of the country. Recently, the Ministry of Education, recognizing the root cause and promoting its benefits and harms, has widely announced to the whole country. The most important sentence is: "For thirty years, our country has been running schools, but social production has lagged behind and people's livelihood has become increasingly difficult. The reason is that ordinary schools have never paid attention to vocational education..." This statement is to the point and truly resonates with my heart. Those of us who have long advocated "vocational education" and campaigned for it in society, once we see this clear instruction, our joy and encouragement are indescribable. We wish for the success of vocational education from the start. It is not that we have a private interest in our usual advocacy, but that it is truly in the best interest of the country and society to do so.</p>
<p>However, nothing in the world is absolute. Often, where there is benefit, there is also harm. Therefore, in the midst of the Ministry of Education's great advocacy for vocational education, I have a sense of both joy and fear. For thirty years, our country has indeed not paid attention to vocational education. However, between 1916 and 1926, the call for vocational education also reached a high pitch. Industrial schools of types A and B were even established in various provinces and regions. But how long did it last? They were reorganized and closed one after another. Although the reasons for their reorganization and closure varied, they were at least due to the difficulty of both talent and money. Due to insufficient funds, the equipment was crude and simple. Due to insufficient talent, the disadvantage of using people in ways that did not suit their strengths arose. Ten years of operation yielded no results. Those with superficial knowledge did not understand the reasons for the failure and instead blamed "vocational education" as being inappropriate. Administrative authorities who generally feared difficulties used this opportunity to hide their shortcomings. "Vocational education" was truly not valued during these five years. "Vocational education" suffered this injustice, which is truly a great misfortune.</p>
<p>Running education is difficult, but running vocational education is even more difficult, as everyone recognizes. Because it is particularly difficult, few people dare to run it, and even fewer succeed. This is due to the difficulty of running it and the improper methods, which has nothing to do with vocational education itself. The difficulty of running vocational education lies in the need for adequate equipment and specialized professors. For industry, there is a need for factories; for agriculture, there is a need for farms; and for commerce, there is a need for appropriate practice grounds. Other school equipment can be crude and simple, but vocational schools must not be incomplete. Professors must also have specialized talents and not only have the ability to teach clearly but also have practical experience. In other words, they must not only be able to "teach" but also be able to "do." This is even more difficult than ordinary schools and absolutely cannot be compromised. Other aspects, such as the standards for setting up schools, the selection of teaching materials, the methods of practice, the promotion of career paths, the training policies, and the teaching methods, can all be said to have "no predecessors to learn from." Everything requires precise investigation and detailed research. Therefore, there must be sufficient preparation, cultivating teachers on the one hand and raising funds on the other. Only then can orders be issued and actions be taken effectively. Otherwise, once it is greatly advocated and the whole country blindly follows suit, from the twentieth year onwards, the trend will be that schools will change from the past, when they changed from vocational to ordinary, to changing from ordinary to vocational. There will inevitably be arbitrary reorganizations without standards. The content will inevitably be nominal without substance. The example of the former type A and B industrial schools will be repeated, causing "vocational education" to suffer injustice again and betraying the enthusiasm of the gentlemen of the Ministry of Education. This is something we do not want to hear.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to joyfully encouraging it, I humbly hope that the educational administrative authorities and those who actually run schools will pay attention to the following points when setting up or reorganizing vocational schools:</p>
<p>1.  Establish departments that adapt to the school's environment.</p>
<p>2.  Estimate the school's economic capacity and equip accordingly.</p>
<p>3.  First, seek suitable teachers.</p>
<p>4.  Predict future career paths.</p>
<p>5.  Investigate the social conditions of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>6.  Strive for contact with the vocational industry.</p>
<p>7.  Have adequate practice grounds.</p>
<p>As for training policies, practice methods, textbook selection, and teaching methods, although the Ministry of Education already has design committees that will provide good models for learning in the future, they must also be adapted to local conditions and times and researched at any time and place. I have a more solemn statement: I say this out of a genuine desire to protect vocational education and a sincere hope for its success. I hope that the school authorities will not be timid because of my words and stop eating because of choking. Considering "vocational education" as the only way to solve the current livelihood and social problems and as an urgent and serious issue, strive to open up a new path for the education sector. It will not only be the fortune of the future of education but also the practical reliance of the country and society.</p>

The Education Department is deeply aware of the overdue education funds and the difficult lives of colleagues in the education sector, and Secretary Shen of the Education Department took the opportunity to attend the provincial government meeting yesterday to present to Chairman Zhang of the provincial government the difficult lives of the education service personnel in the province. The Chairman was deeply moved and immediately instructed the Finance Department to strive to raise another half month's funding in a way that could not be arranged and to provide relief.

<h3 id="e166">Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Urging Improvement of Primary Education <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>20% of the Municipal Council's Revenue Should Be Used for Education</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council, stating: "Respectfully, we received a letter from the Ningbo Association in Shanghai stating that the Concession is restricted by unequal treaties and that the governing power lies outside, which is heartbreaking. However, the education system is the lifeline of the country, and we Chinese must not give up through inertia. On March 26, 1928, your Council proposed that 20% of the Municipal Council's annual revenue be used for our Chinese education funds, which shows that you are enthusiastic about education and concerned about the country, which is admirable. However, in recent years, your Council has not fulfilled the aforementioned proposal for our Chinese education. Furthermore, according to the Municipal Council's Gazette of March 17 of this year, there are currently seven Chinese schools with only 3,281 students, which is 1,526 fewer than the 4,817 students in Western schools. The reason is that the schools set up by the Municipal Council are too expensive and do not meet the principle of education for the common people, and the education policy does not conform to the purpose of party-based education in our Republic of China. The Church has established eleven free schools for the purpose of cultivating the children of fellow villagers in Shanghai, and enrollment is free of charge. Although limited by funding and unable to expand as much as possible, the number of children in school now exceeds 4,000. The education policy implements the Three Principles of the People in teaching and various courses and extracurricular activities at all times and places, in order to achieve the effect of firm belief and practice and to cultivate the virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace in the citizens. Therefore, based on the experience of our Association, on the one hand, we should proceed with diplomacy to recover the education rights of the Concession, and on the other hand, your Association should represent all our Chinese taxpayers to urge the Municipal Council to fulfill the proposal of March 26, 1928, to use 29% of the Municipal Council's annual revenue for our Chinese education funds and allow our Chinese to manage it ourselves. In response to this, the city has already sent a letter to your Council to handle the education issue diligently. In addition to replying to the letter, we are sending this letter to you for reference and joint handling."</p>

<p>Chinese YMCA Unaccustomed to Venue | Loses to Western YMCA</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western YMCA agreed to hold the first match between handball players from the two associations yesterday at 6:00 PM at the Western YMCA to exchange skills. Many people came to watch. In terms of the strength of the players of the two teams, they were evenly matched. Because the Chinese YMCA was not accustomed to the venue at the beginning (the Western YMCA's court is bounded on all four sides, while the Chinese YMCA's court is only on three sides, so the ball often could not be returned when it hit the back wall) and the rules were different, the team members were not complete, and the score was often behind. Later, the venue became slightly familiar, and they learned the method and chased forward. However, the early birds had already flown ahead, and as a result, the Western YMCA won the Chinese YMCA by nine points to three points. It is reported that the second match is scheduled for next Monday (the 4th) at 6:00 PM at the Chinese YMCA. Because they wanted to become familiar with the association's court, they were willing to suffer losses and still play at the Western YMCA. The results of the first match between the two teams are attached below.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Mr. Wang Yansong (Photo taken at Red Light Photo Studio) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<h3 id="e187">Labor Representative Hou Dachun Speaks <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency reporter visited Hou Dachun, the standing supervisor of the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union, who is the labor representative this time, to inquire about his views on the National Assembly. Mr. Hou graciously met with the reporter and answered the questions one by one. The main points are summarized below. Mr. Hou said that the National Assembly is an unprecedented grand event that will benefit the Party and the country and benefit the people's livelihood. All the workers in the city are determined to sincerely support it and witness its success. Although we workers occupy an important position in the production sector, we have never had the opportunity to participate in politics. Since the Republic of China, although elections for councilors have been held in various places, due to the poor electoral system, the regional representative system has been adopted, which is mostly controlled by wealthy gentlemen and landlords. As a result, workers have been excluded. Since the National Government moved to Nanjing and implemented the political tutelage and construction, industry and commerce conferences and other important conferences related to labor have been held, but labor representatives have never been invited to attend and participate, so that the opinions of the workers have not been contributed, resulting in many gaps. I personally regret this very much. The holding of this National Assembly is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and adopts a professional representative system. We workers can then fully enjoy the right to elect and be elected, and can freely express all opinions in the meeting, which is truly a pioneering event for Chinese workers to participate in politics. It is a pity that the preparation period for the National Assembly was too short, and many labor unions in Shanghai have not yet completed the reorganization, so the number of people who gave up the election or did not have time to participate in the election is still large. However, observing the psychology of the workers in the city, they are all wholeheartedly supporting the National Assembly. As for the proposals of the workers in this city to the National Assembly, they are being actively prepared recently, and there is an organization called the National Assembly Shanghai Workers' Proposal Research Association, which is presided over by the talented people in the labor industry of this city. The research content includes requesting the National Assembly to automatically declare the abolition of all unequal treaties, requesting the National Assembly to determine the policy of converting soldiers into workers based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, establishing a labor department, promulgating a special labor union law, determining the implementation of a labor education plan, formulating a labor insurance system, providing relief to unemployed workers, and amending various laws that are detrimental to labor welfare, etc. In the end, the individual has followed the workers of the city and struggled to this day without fail. I am deeply apprehensive about being elected as a representative by the love of the workers of the city. I believe that I am shallow in scholarship, weak in strength, and lacking in ability to be competent. However, in the face of great righteousness, I should do my best, but my own ability is limited, and I still rely on the full guidance of the workers of the city to achieve complete success.</p>

<p>Scheduled for May 5th</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Relocation Design Committee, since determining the location of the new county seat and setting the date of January 1, 1932, for the completion of everything, the National News Agency reporter visited Mr. Wu Wenhua, the chairman of the committee yesterday.

<p>Cotton Cloth Cargo Fully Restored One Day Exporting 6,000 Pieces</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Industry to Refuse to Pay Dockage Fee Generating Problems</p>
<p>After the customs workers in this city followed the order to resume work yesterday, all cotton cloth cargo to the East and West Oceans was restored. Because cotton cloth merchants refused to pay the dockage fee, a meeting will be held today to discuss the matter. The various situations are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Resumption of Transportation Situation <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the trade union notice, the customs workers all went to resume work yesterday morning. Because the consignors have been on strike until now, the inventory has been sold out, and the goods are urgently needed. The various scheduled goods were all rushed for export yesterday, totaling more than 6,000 pieces. Cotton goods are piled up like mountains at Mitsubishi Wharf, Second Avenue Wharf, New Wharf, Jardine Wharf, etc. The customs workers are extremely busy, and the police authorities have dispatched additional patrols to maintain traffic at the various wharves.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Another Problem Arises <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The tobacco industry customs brokers convened a general meeting at Tongjulong Customs Brokerage on Tianzhutang Street yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss the cotton cloth industry's refusal to pay the dockage fee. All 15 companies, including Yishun Heng, unanimously advocated that a letter be sent to the industry association immediately to convene a general meeting of all customs brokers and to suggest to the association that the dockage fee should be collected by the cotton cloth merchants no matter what. If the cotton cloth industry insists, all transportation will be suspended from today.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Emergency Meeting <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Because the cotton cloth merchants of each company that the customs brokers were carrying yesterday uniformly refused to pay the dockage fee, and the consignors could not agree, they temporarily paid it and reported it to the association, requesting strict negotiations. The Customs Brokers Association notified all colleagues yesterday that a meeting would be held today to discuss the matter. Because the matter of the cotton cloth industry refusing to pay the dockage fee is related to the interests of the industry, an emergency meeting will be convened tomorrow (the 28th) at 3:00 PM at Qingyunli for public discussion. It is hoped that you will attend at that time.</p>

<p>The Customs Brokers Union sent a letter to the various unions yesterday, stating that it was grateful for the sympathy and support. Since the strike of the union, it has been more than two weeks. The Social Bureau has mediated several times without success. On the 24th, the final mediation reached a satisfactory resolution and revised the draft agreement, so that the inherent precedents of decades were not destroyed. Although the matter was handled impartially by the Social Bureau, it was also due to your honorable words of advice and the spirit of fearlessness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen to fight. Therefore, I hereby send a letter of thanks. The union has already ordered the resumption of work on the 27th.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Sending Ships to Carry Unemployed Overseas Workers from Giant Port Back to China <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Totaling 352 People</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Communications Are Negotiating</p>
<p>There are quite a few Chinese in Giant Port. Recently, due to various restrictions, the majority are unemployed, and some cannot live there for a day. The consul in the port, in view of this situation, repeatedly telegraphed the national government to request relief. The Ministry of Industry is currently negotiating to send ships to carry these distressed overseas workers back to China. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Consul Cai Reports <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Consul Cai Xianzhang stationed in Giant Port reported to the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, stating that the Research and Art Machinery Union of Giant Port requested relief and forwarded it to the National Government for appropriation of travel expenses to summon unemployed overseas Chinese workers to return to China, etc. Minister Kong telegraphed Cai to order him to investigate and report the number and situation of unemployed workers in the area. After the report, it was stated that according to the report of the union, there were 322 unemployed workers, and another 30 workers' families and children. The estimated travel expenses required are about 60,000 yuan in national currency, which is really a large amount. At this time, the national treasury is empty, and I am deeply afraid that it will be difficult to do so. I think it is better to send a domestic commercial ship to carry the unemployed overseas workers back, which will save national currency and can also try sailing the Nanyang route, which is a good thing to do. Is it feasible to transfer the inquiry to the Ministry of Communications for review and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Ministry of Industry Transfers Ship <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>After Minister Kong telegraphed his report, he consulted the Ministry of Transportation, stating roughly that, according to Consul Cai's report, the proposed dispatch of a ship to transport unemployed Chinese laborers back from Ju'gang (Jakarta) would benefit both worker relief and shipping development, and the plan was indeed appropriate. However, the dispatch of commercial ships falls under your ministry's jurisdiction. Therefore, he consulted with you to investigate and reply. The Ministry of Transportation then informed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stating that the Consul's request to send a ship to transport overseas Chinese laborers from Ju'gang back to China was for the purpose of saving national currency and providing relief to workers, which was indeed feasible. However, the company should consider whether there were any ships available for dispatch, so that they could reply to the Consul.</p>
<h3 id="e200">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Deliberation <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of dispatching a ship, the Ministry of Transportation mainly suggested that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company allocate a ship. However, sending an empty ship to Ju'gang would be a great sacrifice. It would be best to also load goods and passengers to that location, so that freight charges could be collected to compensate for the cost. This matter still needs to await the return of Commissioner Li Zhonggong to Shanghai to discuss and determine a plan before a final decision and telegram reply to Ju'gang.</p>

<p>Liu Jinshan, a worker at the Romek Sugar Factory, was brutally beaten by a White Russian named Mirikovsk at 8:30 AM on March 11th and sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. He passed away in the hospital at 8:00 AM on the 24th of this month after more than a month. He is survived by his elderly mother in her sixties, a young widow, and two orphans under the age of five, a truly pitiful situation. Representatives of the factory workers, Jiang Dechen, Xiao Huanzhang, Li Shujun, Jiang Zongguan, Li Shouji, Liu Yiqing, Zhang Kerong, Sun Lin, Meng Qingxian, Cheng Yongshu, Ling Asan, Gao Shouyun, and others, issued a declaration. The original text is very long; excerpts are as follows: "Dear workers and people from all walks of life, Worker Liu's family includes a white-haired mother in her sixties and a young widow, as well as two orphans under the age of five, all of whom depended on Worker Liu's hard-earned money for support. The brutal attacker has not only directly harmed Worker Liu personally but has also indirectly harmed his entire family's life. Who would not be heartbroken by this situation? (Middle omitted) At a time when the National Assembly is approaching and civil rights are being promoted, the perpetrators of this heinous act have dared to flaunt their cruelty and inflict such brutal treatment, leading to the death of our fellow worker. Anyone with a shred of conscience cannot help but be outraged. We hope that our fellow workers and people from all walks of life will provide strong support to our factory. This is not just a matter for the workers of our factory but a matter of concern for all workers in Shanghai. The workers of our factory solemnly declare to all labor unions, workers, and people from all walks of life that we must work together to strive for humanity and protect the safety of all workers in Shanghai. Our factory proposes: (1) Immediately execute the detained Mirikovsk as retribution. (2) Immediately punish the Romek factory owner who condoned the violence.

<p>Court Notice: Landlords Take Note</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Stamp Tax Office previously issued a letter to the Special District Local Court requesting assistance in the matter of landlords in the concessions continuing to delay in affixing stamp duty to rent receipts. The letter stated that if there were any cases of rent arrears lawsuits, those rent receipts that had not been affixed with stamp duty would be punished according to regulations, as a warning to others. It is now known that the court has issued a notice to all landlords to comply. The original text is as follows: "The Jiangsu Shanghai Special District Local Court issues a notice regarding the matter of a letter received from the Shanghai Special District Stamp Tax Office of the Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, stating, 'Since the establishment of our office, we have been greatly assisted by your court in promoting stamp tax affairs, which has enabled smooth progress and increased tax revenue. We are extremely grateful. However, in the matter of rent receipts, stamp duty should be affixed in accordance with regulations. Currently, many landlords in the concessions are complying with regulations, but there are also many who are delaying compliance. In addition to our office sending personnel to provide earnest guidance and carry out thorough rectification, we plan to request that your court, in cases of rent arrears lawsuits, immediately punish those rent receipts that have not been affixed with stamp duty according to regulations and order them to affix supplementary stamp duty as a warning to others. This will ensure that cunning individuals are deterred from engaging in evasive practices and that the future of national tax revenue will greatly benefit. Accordingly, we send this letter to your court, requesting that you investigate and comply, and we hope to receive a reply.' After the letter was received by our court, in addition to replying to the letter, we issue this notice to inform all parties concerned. This notice.'"</p>

<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association telegraphed Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, stating, "According to letters from stone quarry owners, quarry workers, merchants, and boat owners in Yin County, the county government has unexpectedly imposed a stone material tax, causing great alarm among the people. Over four thousand quarry workers and boat owners have stopped work, creating a critical situation. We request a telegram from the Provincial Government for relief. Our association's staff member, Mr. Zhang Shenzhi, has returned to his hometown to investigate and reported that boat owners have stopped transportation since the date of imposition and quarry workers have stopped working since the other date, and the number of workers is large, causing concern for public order. Currently, there are clear orders to exempt burdensome taxes and miscellaneous levies. It is not appropriate to create new names and set up checkpoints to collect taxes, disturbing the majority of laborers and causing hidden dangers. We request a swift telegraphic order to stop this and a reply. Yu Hede and others of the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association respectfully inquire."</p>

<p>Kang and Tibet are rich regions of our country, but due to inconvenient transportation and low levels of public knowledge, goods are abandoned on the ground, allowing foreigners to covet them. This is truly regrettable. Recently, Zhang Yuan, Wang Jinyuan, and others initiated the Kang-Tibet Walking Group, planning to spend several years conducting on-site investigations. It is reported that more than a dozen people have joined. They plan to enter Xikang and Tibet through Sichuan, pass through India and the South Seas Islands, and then return home. They will report the details of their investigations to the people of the country, as a guide to developing the western frontier. The group has now set up an office at No. 7 Lianzhi Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, and is preparing all travel procedures. They will depart as soon as they are ready.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Taxpayers Association Pleads for Rickshaw Pullers <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Police Tear Up Permits, Confiscate Cushions</p>
<p>Not a Method to Maintain Traffic</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday to help rickshaw pullers, stating: "Sir, according to Mr. Squire's letter, I have repeatedly sought to improve the living conditions of rickshaw pullers, but with little effect. I am writing to you in the hope that you will be fair and provide assistance. From my window in the Sassoon House, I see Chinese police officers forcibly pointing out rickshaw pullers for violating traffic regulations and tearing up their permits and confiscating the cushions from their rickshaws. I have written to Mr. Masesson of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Gospel Society to warn the rickshaw pullers of the dangers of soliciting business on the road. Mr. Ma replied that this is the responsibility of the police. I have written to the police station, and they have promised to consider it. I have also printed flyers and distributed them every morning to the Chinese police officers standing at the entrance of the Huizhong Hotel, but the tearing up of permits and the confiscation of cushions continues to occur daily. In these times of economic downturn, I cannot bear the cruel treatment of the poor rickshaw pullers. Can your council provide assistance in this matter?" The association investigated and found that the police tearing up permits and confiscating cushions from rickshaw pullers has become commonplace. The only reason given is that the rickshaw pullers are disrupting traffic regulations. However, many police officers are arbitrarily tearing up permits and confiscating cushions to gain merit. The association believes that traffic regulations should be maintained, but tearing up permits and confiscating cushions is not the best way to maintain traffic regulations. Furthermore, when police officers tear up permits and confiscate cushions, those who are not being torn up will pull their rickshaws wildly and crash around in an attempt to escape, while those who have been torn up will kowtow to the police officers like pounding garlic or even have to meet their certain needs in order to have their permits and cushions returned on the spot. At this time, traffic order is not maintained but rather lost, which is not the right way to do things. Therefore, the association believes that Mr. Squire's proposal is very correct and sends this letter to you in the hope that you will investigate and handle it accordingly.</p>

<p>Looks Like a Revenge Killing</p>
<p>They Fled Without Stealing Anything</p>
<p>In Ni Cai’s (a Ningbo native) small tobacco and paper shop near the Bingchangtian ice factory on Nanchang East Road in Pudong’s Lan Ni Du town, two uninvited guests suddenly arrived the night before last. One stood outside as a lookout, and the other went inside, pulled out a handgun, and opened fire, wounding Ni’s son, Amao, in the face, but not fatally. The police station’s investigation determined that it was likely a revenge killing. Yesterday, they submitted a report to the Public Security Bureau, requesting an order to arrest the perpetrators. Here are the details of the investigation:</p>
<h3 id="e223">Gun Pulled Out and Fired <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Ni, 51 years old, has been running a small tobacco and paper shop at No. 16 Bingchangtian for several years. His family also lives there. The small business is enough to cover expenses. At 7:00 PM the night before last, after dinner, Ni and his son, Amao (18 years old), were chatting in the shop when a middle-aged man of small stature suddenly entered, wearing a dark blue long gown, a solid-colored woolen vest, and a pointed hat. Another person stood outside as a lookout. The person who entered first took out two small silver coins and said he wanted to buy cigarettes. Ni had just recovered from an illness and was hard of hearing and slow to respond. The man became angry and twisted Ni's collar with his left hand, reached into his pocket with his right hand, pulled out a handgun, and pointed it at his son Amao's head, pulling the trigger. With a "pop" sound, the bullet entered his right cheek near the ear and exited through his right mouth. The perpetrator, seeing that his goal had been achieved, immediately fled outside.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Cousin Seems Suspicious <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>When Li Tianfu, a guard from the No. 3 District of the Public Security Bureau, arrived after hearing the report, he saw Amao's face covered in blood and immediately took him to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's examination, it was determined that the bullet had exited and the injury was not fatal. Zhang, the district chief, used the telephone to notify the No. 4 Squad to send officers to various locations to search, but the perpetrator had already disappeared. They then returned to Ni's small shop to investigate the situation and found a bullet casing on the ground. Ni stated that nothing in the shop was lost, and he had no enemies except for his cousin, Ni Shangen, with whom he had not been in contact for 18 years. He suddenly came to his house the week before last, wanting to borrow 50 yuan, but only ate a meal and left in a huff. It is not known whether he held a grudge and sought to kill his son. The district chief determined that the case was not a robbery but rather a revenge killing. Yesterday, he reported the details to the Public Security Bureau, requesting an order to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Wu Cheng and Pan Zhaobang, the liquidators of the Shanghai Riya Bank, filed a lawsuit in the French Court against more than ten households, including the Samsung Stage, Samsung Real Estate Company, Taiheyuan, Nanjing Sock Factory, and Hangzhou Restaurant, for failing to pay their debts to the Riya Bank, requesting that they be recovered in full. Yesterday, Zhao Ruquan of the Samsung Stage was summoned and retained a lawyer to argue that the Samsung Stage did indeed owe money to the Riya Bank, but that more than 1,000 yuan and 250 taels of silver were paid on behalf of Huang Chu Jiu and should be deducted. As for the Samsung Real Estate Company, it was jointly organized by Zhao Ruquan, Zhou Bingchen, and Huang Chu Jiu, and each person should pay 20,000 yuan in capital. The contract stated that if there were any profits, the three would share them equally. It is now found that the company has paid out more than 180,000 taels of the Riya Bank's money, which should be the responsibility of Huang Chu Jiu to return. There are ledgers to prove this. The judge ordered that the accounts be verified first. Someone on behalf of Taiheyuan said that the money had been paid to the guarantor and taken away. The judge ordered the guarantor to be summoned for further questioning. The Nanjing Sock Factory refused to sign. The judge ordered a summons to be issued for the case to be pursued. The manager of the Hangzhou Restaurant stated that he admitted to owing money, but that the Riya Bank owed a shareholder 1,600 yuan, which he requested permission to deduct. Accountant Pan stood up to object. The judge adjourned the hearing to one month.</p>

<p>Shajin Village in the second excited town's southern sands area of Haimen County, north of Wusong, the chief of the village, Sha Jinzao's family had saved a bit of money leading to it being coveted by bandits, The night before last around eight o'clock suddenly ten or more bandits, mostly speaking the local dialect, each holding handguns and electric torches, broke down the door and entered, first driving the family members to a room and confining them, then twisting Sha Jinzao, beating him and extorting silver dollars because Sha's speech was hesitant, the bandits shot him dead. They then ransacked the house, taking all the clothes and other stolen goods, and ordered Sha's servant, Fan Chaohai, to tie them up for them. Fan refused, and was also shot dead by the bandits. Then they left Yangchang. The family members, knowing the bandits were gone, came out and saw that the two had fallen to the ground in a pool of blood, dead. Yesterday, the county was informed and asked for an autopsy and to arrest the murderers.</p>

<p>How Can Human Life Be Settled Privately?</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaohu, the 13-year-old younger sister of Liu Zhengshi, a woman from Yancheng residing at No. 6 Yinghua Lane, Xiaosha Ferry, was taken in at the age of nine as a child bride by Song Laisheng of No. 3 Zhangjia Lane, Hukou Bridge, Hongkou. Song then sent Xiaohu to the Houfu Silk Factory to work. According to Song Laisheng, four days ago, she was abused and severely beaten by a Chen-surname cart driver due to poor work, resulting in serious injuries and death. But it has been three days since her death, and attempts to settle the matter privately have been unsuccessful. What is most strange is that Song Laisheng wants to file a lawsuit because the settlement has failed, but Liu Zhengshi is unwilling to seek justice for her sister. Xu Jinlin, the local bailiff, believed that the matter could not be delayed any longer and reported it to the local court for an autopsy yesterday. However, Liu Zhengshi also went to the court with the bailiff to request that the autopsy be waived. She was severely reprimanded and ordered to await the examination in order to value human life.</p>

<p>Attention, Those with Young Children</p>
<p>The Gong family, residing at No. 59 Peide Lane, Xinzha Datong Road, Public Concession, had a three-year-old son born in the previous year. He was plump, lively, and much loved.

Instantly, the pit lodged in his throat, causing him to moan and choke. His breath was blocked, his eyes rolled up, and his face turned blue. The family was shocked and at a loss, knowing that the situation was critical, and immediately hired a car to send him to the hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was found that the pit had penetrated deep into the trachea and could not be removed. He died at about 9:00 PM. May parents in all circles pay serious attention to this matter.</p>

Two held hatchets, and one pulled out a handgun and pointed it at his chest, declaring, "Rogue, should we spare your life, or don't blame us for not warning you!" After saying this, one of them used a hatchet to chop at him wildly. He was chopped in the left and right legs, and his right hand was chopped, with all five fingers nearly severed. Fang collapsed on the spot. The assailants then fled. Someone called the No. 541 guard post, and they arrived in a car and took the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The rosewood dismantling merchants gathered at 2 PM the day before yesterday inside the Yonglin Hall Rosewood Guild Hall on Guanyinge Street in the city to convene an emergency meeting of all businesses in the city. More than ten people attended. Wang Rundong and others proposed, "Our industry has had the Yonglin Hall Guild Hall for many years. Due to the need to organize various business tax issues, we should reorganize the trade association in accordance with the law. We have submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Party Headquarters Civil Training Committee for approval. We urgently need to prepare and solicit membership from businesses." After discussion, it was decided that once the Municipal Civil Training Committee's license is received, a general meeting will be convened to actively handle legal matters. They then proposed that since January of the 16th year of the Republic, customs duties on our rosewood materials have increased six times, four or five times more than before, and the burden of converting silver to gold is too heavy to bear. The benefits of tax reduction have not been received, and the impact of increased taxes has already affected us. If we do not request a thorough understanding from the financial authorities, a major disaster will likely lead our industry to bankruptcy. All of you have a vital stake in this, and we should discuss this at length. It was decided to convene all businesses in the city to come to the meeting on a fixed date, and publicly elect representatives to carry out the petition. The discussion ended at 5 PM, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Taibao Ashu (aka Xu Tianxiong), the leader of the Pudong bandit gang who rampaged along the coast of Taihu Lake in various counties, towns, and villages, burning and killing without restraint, his younger brother Xu Fusheng, and Zhu Luo Amei have been successively arrested by Xu Pucheng, the District Chief of the Second District of Jiangsu River Police, and approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Pacification Superintendent's Office to be escorted to the locations where they committed crimes for public execution. District Chief Xu, now that the major criminals have been executed, believes that</p>

<p>Who have not been completely eliminated, so he has not relaxed in the slightest in the pursuit and arrest of those still at large. Therefore, he continues to select and dispatch detectives stationed in Shanghai to investigate, in order to cut off the roots. After discovering that remnants were hiding at No. 96 in the lane next to Mingde Elementary School on An'nan Road in West Shanghai, District Chief Xu led Team Leader Jiang Ziyun and Detective Chief Huan Guanlin to Shanghai to join forces with the Chinese and Western detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station to rush to the location for a raid at 5:25 AM the day before yesterday. They surrounded the front and back doors of the house and then broke in. The men and women in the rooms upstairs and downstairs were all</p>

<p>Woken up by the sound and captured without resistance. A total of eleven people were apprehended, including: (1) Li Wenjun, also known as Li Guijie, the political director and secretary general of Taibao Ashu's puppet division, is thirty years old. After graduating from Songjiang Third Middle School, he initially joined the Kuomintang and then turned to the Communist Party. He served as an executive committee member of the Communist Party in his hometown of Fengxian County, inciting workers and peasants to riot and promoting class struggle with extraordinary effort.

<p>Of Zhuanghang Town in Fengxian in the winter of the 17th year of the Republic was actually led by Li. Later, introduced by Zhao Guomin (aka Zhao Amu), the puppet commander of the Third Regiment under Ashu's command, he joined Ashu's forces and worked hard for the Communist cause. According to reports, Ashu's gang is composed of three factions: bandits, Communists, and Reorganizationists. All acts of robbery and fraud by the bandits were directed by Ashu, while the</p>

<p>Of murder and arson was directed by Li Wenjun, who specialized in disrupting the rear. The reorganizationists in Anning had other instigators. (2) Lu Fugen, also known as Shunxiang, and Li Wenjun are both registered on the official roster. It is expected that it will not be difficult for those who escaped the net to be</p>
<h3 id="e251">Identified According to the Roster. <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>(3) Qian Moqu is the brother of Taibao Ashu's third wife. (4) Qian Zhang is Moqu's mother, i.e., Taibao's mother-in-law. (5) Qian Xiangrong is the second daughter of Qian Zhang, i.e., Taibao's sister-in-law. (6) Li Wei is Li Wenjun's mistress. It is said that she has been with Li for only three weeks. (7) Qian Weirong is Taibao's third wife. According to her, she is</p>

<p>In reality, she did not volunteer but was forcibly occupied by Taibao using force. The eighth to eleventh are Madam Chen Gu, Madam Wu Qian, Madam Jin Lin, and Madam Lu Li. The records of these four women are not detailed. Chinese and Western detectives then took these people back to the police station, and several detectives guarded the house, waiting for outside accomplices. Later, an old woman brought a child from elsewhere and was also detained in the police station. According to the old woman, her name is Cao Fei, and the child is named Chen Asan, only fourteen years old. Those who know say that the old woman is actually Taibao</p>

<p>And the child is Ashu's younger brother. On the day Ashu was executed, the old mother and young brother that he was reluctant to leave behind and pleaded with the officials to show leniency were these two. District Chief Xu, believing that those apprehended were all important criminals and fearing that accomplices were hiding elsewhere, specially consulted with the police chief to allow the prior transfer of Li Wenjun, Lu Fugen, and Qian Moqu to the district headquarters for thorough investigation. After Li and others confessed that Zhao Guomin, the puppet commander of the Third Regiment, and He Yinyu, the puppet battalion commander, were hiding in the French Concession, they coordinated with the French police in the afternoon to</p>

<p>And bring them back to the district headquarters to await interrogation. Li and the other three were sent back to the police station for detention. Because Li confessed that Xu Yabo was the old man of him and Taibao Ashu, District Chief Xu, along with police detectives, secretly went to the house at No. 332, Sixth Lane, Duofu Lane, at the intersection of Changbang Road and Tongfu Road at 7:30 PM the night before yesterday to</p>

<p>And seized a pistol, six bullets, a gun license, and a letter of appointment with the symbol of the commander of the Second Brigade of the newly compiled National Revolutionary Army Twentieth Division, etc., which were also taken back to the police station for detention. However, it is reported that the division and brigade were ordered to be disbanded by the military authorities last year, so Xu cannot be recognized as a military officer. Yesterday morning, he, along with Li Wenjun and a group of men and women, were transferred to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Ge Zhitan opened the second court session for interrogation. Police Station Lawyer Zhang Tianyin reported on the circumstances of the cracking of the case. District Chief Xu Pucheng of the Jiangsu Province River Police arrived in court to state that Taibao Ashu led his men in</p>

<p>Disturbing the peace, detailing the facts from the day the bandit started robbing on March 8, 18th year of the Republic, to his recent execution. He stated that Xu Yabo was working as a reorganizationist in the bandit gang and was appointed as a puppet bandit official. Yu and he were both under the same water police district, Yu was the captain of the Fifth Team, and he was the captain of the Fourth Team. When the National Army recovered Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Yu and others were ordered by District Chief Yang to lead the team to suppress the bandits. However, he actually led his troops to surrender to a certain party and resist the National Army. Yu had accused him, but he did not repent and instead helped the bandits to abuse the people, and should be extradited together. When questioned, Xu Yabo confessed that he was</p>

<p>Claiming that I was a water police inspector in the 8th year of the Republic, and was promoted to captain of the Fourth Team in the 13th year. Xu Pucheng was the captain of the Fifth Team. In the 16th year, I was promoted to district chief and Pucheng was</p>

<p>(His lawyer then presented the photo of the presentation to the court.) I originally resided on Huanlong Road. This year, I have received two threatening letters from Taibao Ashu. One day, a pistol was thrown into my window, and I reported it to the French police. Fearing that there might be an accident, I moved to Duofu Lane. I have never had any contact with the bandit. Li Wenjun, however, fully acknowledged his actions and claimed that what he had confessed in the police station yesterday was</p>

<p>Not Xu Yabo. At the end, the police station lawyer expressed his opinion that the police station did not agree to the extradition of anyone other than Li Wenjun in this case, because it had not been proven that they had committed crimes. Judge Ge then interrogated each defendant one by one, and ordered Li Wenjun to be handed over to District Chief Xu to be taken back for investigation. Qian Moqu and his mother and sisters were released. The remaining nine men and women, including Lu Fugen, were separately detained for further investigation after clarification.</p>
<h3 id="e260">The French Concession Court Continues to Hear the Nihon-Ya Ginko Case Yesterday <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Court Treats Everyone Equally</p>
<p>After Collecting All Outstanding Payments</p>
<p>It Will Distribute Them Equally to Creditors</p>
<p>In the case of the bankruptcy of Shanghai Nihon-Ya Ginko and the Great World Amusement Savings Department, the French Concession Court continued to hear the case yesterday. Accountant Pan Zhaobang stated that the distribution in this case could have been reported today, but because some of the creditors filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court, there was an attachment of the Chinese and Western Pharmacy and the Hot Spring Bathhouse, which delayed the transfer price of the receiver. It is still under discussion. After a solution is discussed, it will be discussed with the lawyers representing the creditors. Furthermore, in order to review the total amount of claims, the accountant and others sent a letter to the four volunteer lawyers, including Jiang Yiping, requesting them to open the debt accounts of their clients, but no reply has been received. There is also the issue of the disposal of the Great World. Someone is willing to pay 700,000 to take over, another person is willing to pay 800,000 to pay in three years, and another person is willing to pay 1 million to pay in four years. It is currently under negotiation. The court was asked whether the directors and shareholders of this case should be responsible. The official said that the previous court order had already ruled that the shareholders should be responsible. Plaintiff Lawyer Yan Luqing said, "Is the court announcing today the court order regarding the directors and shareholders?" The official said that a date must be set separately. Plaintiff Lawyer Bian Jialu said that it has been more than three months since the liquidation of Nihon-Ya Ginko. All the depositors are poor people, some are seeking education for their children, some are marrying off their daughters, and some are unemployed workers waiting for the money to use. Since the bankruptcy, there have been cases of unemployment, lack of education, lack of work, and lack of food, borrowing and lending. I request the court to order the two accountants to distribute the money already received as soon as possible to alleviate the urgent need. Furthermore, my lawyer would like to make a special statement. There is a misunderstanding and panic among the creditors because the directors initially asked someone to come to my lawyer's office to mediate, agreeing to 300,000 yuan in cash and then issuing 300,000 yuan in stocks, asking my lawyer to reconcile and withdraw the entire case. Because my lawyer took full account of the interests of the creditors, he refused at the time, causing the creditors to misunderstand the general situation and blame my lawyer for refusing, causing the case to be delayed until now without any money being received. Otherwise, a portion of the money would have been received earlier. Or because my lawyer received a certain amount of motion money early on and deliberately delayed the case, all kinds of misunderstandings. This point originally does not need to be stated, because there are ignorant people among the creditors who will inevitably be used and thus make unwarranted accusations." Lawyer Zhou Xiaoan also said that the money was all saved by poor people, and many have committed suicide as a result of the bankruptcy. He requested that Huang's family property be sold as soon as possible, but as for the bankruptcy of Nihon-Ya Ginko until now, I don't know how much the accountants have actually received. Please report in detail so that it can be distributed as soon as possible. At this point, Accountant Pan said that he has received about 40,000 yuan in outstanding payments. The detailed accounts were not brought to the court today, and it is difficult to distribute the small amount of money at once. Plaintiff Lawyer Yan Luqing also said that he has now received a letter from creditors stating that the manager of Jiuzhitang has absconded with the money, Huang Longtai's tools for making a living have been replaced, and the electric fans in Luochunge Teahouse have been removed, and the water tap has been turned off, and the water used daily is bought from outside. I don't know if these points are true. For the sake of the interests of the creditors, please ask the court to order the accountant to investigate and report. Also, the bank collapsed three months after Huang Chujiu's death, and Huang Chujiu's coffin has been buried, but the creditors have not received a penny of their debts. I request the court to order the liquidator to actively proceed and repay the money as soon as possible. Lawyer Xu Yannian said in conclusion that the most important thing in this case is to review the total amount of claims, liquidate the accounts, and dispose of Huang's property. The accountants must proceed quickly and have concrete measures to ensure an early conclusion. Judge Gong granted permission to order the liquidator to actively proceed in the future in order to collect the outstanding payments as soon as possible so that the creditors can be distributed. As for the request to distribute them in advance, this court treats all creditors equally and should not have divergent measures. There is no difference whether creditors participate in litigation in this court or not. The request to distribute claims first is difficult to approve. The liquidator is ordered to first review the claims to determine them to avoid divergence. According to the creditors' request, the liquidator should actively proceed and distribute the money in advance to the creditors who filed the lawsuit in this court and review the claims. The court found that although this case has been delayed for three months since its inception, it is because the creditors' opinions are inconsistent, causing various obstacles, so the liquidator cannot proceed. Now that there is consistency, there should be no more misunderstandings. The creditors are asked to wait quietly for a solution.</p>

<p>Xue Qishi Regrets It Deeply</p>
<p>Demands Compensation of More Than 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Xue Qishi, formerly an actor at the Shanghai Film Company, recently hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint in the Special District Local Court against Zhao Taishan, an actor at the Youlian Film Company on North Sichuan Road, Shigaota Road, and manager Chen Kangran, for injury. The reasons for his complaint are that he was intentionally injured in the course of his duties, resulting in disability, and requested punishment, with a civil lawsuit attached. The plaintiff claims that he has been a film actor at the Shanghai Film Company for many years. Because Chen Kangran was competing in business, he used insidious means, pretending to borrow actors from the Shanghai Film Company as a pretext, but in reality, he had other intentions. When the plaintiff was hired, he was unaware of the hidden motives and rashly engaged in the performance. On October 14, 17th year of the Republic, he played the main role of Zhao Dagang in a scene of Two Red Butterflies. The defendant, Zhao Taishan, was instigated by Chen Kangran and took the opportunity to violently cut off a section of the plaintiff's right index finger with a knife, and also injured his middle finger and thumb. The defendant sacrificed the plaintiff's lifelong happiness for the sake of business relations. His vicious intentions and cruel methods are obvious. He should be punished according to law, and a civil lawsuit should be attached, requesting the defendant to compensate for damages of 24,960 yuan. The court approved the petition and issued a summons. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Cheng Shangfeng presided over the third criminal court to gather and interrogate the defendant. Chen Kangran did not arrive. His lawyer stated that he was filming in Suzhou and could not be present today. The plaintiff, Xue Qishi, testified the above circumstances and presented several pieces of evidence, including a leaflet, a bottle of medicine, and several shadow play magazines, saying that after I was injured during filming, the Youlian Company took the opportunity to expand its promotion. The bottle of medicine now contains my severed finger section. There are several photos in the shadow play magazine that prove my position at the Shanghai Film Company at the time was not low. When I worked for the Shanghai Company, in addition to a monthly salary of 80 yuan, I would receive an additional 100 yuan for each film I made. Now that I am disabled, my future prospects are cut off, so I am attaching a civil lawsuit, calculating at 130 yuan per month, which should compensate 24,960 yuan for nineteen years. The defendant, Zhao Taishan, testified that this matter happened three years ago. When filming Two Red Butterflies, the plaintiff played the role of the bandit Zhao Dagang in the play, and there should be a scene where he was besieged by government troops. At that time, there were about sixty or seventy government troops, each holding real knives and guns, surrounding the plaintiff for a fight. As a result, the plaintiff suddenly claimed that his finger was injured. At that time, I happened to be holding a knife, so it was suspected that I had cut it. In fact, the plaintiff did not know who cut him. The defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant, Chen Kangran, had also filed a complaint against the plaintiff for extortion, and the case was scheduled to be heard this afternoon. Judge Cheng verified the confessions and ordered the hearing to be postponed for seven days to summon witnesses for further interrogation.</p>

Cao has a friend named Qian Aru, who used to be a driver for a long-distance bus company. He is 31 years old and already has a yellow-faced wife at home. He often visits Cao's house and has become a close friend. He knows that Cao has assets and that everything is in his daughter's hands, so he plots to seduce her, but has no opportunity. It was not until June of last year that Qian went to Cao's house again, and Cao and his wife were both out on business. Qian took advantage of the opportunity and betrayed his friend, teasing and soliciting the girl. Although the girl initially refused, Qian's body was burly, so in the end, the girl was raped by Qian. After this, the girl's heart was confused. Qian often took the opportunity to date in secret and solicit money from the girl, and the girl often helped with money.

Under questioning, he stated his name as Hu Bin, 27 years old, originally from Linli County, Hunan Province, born in Jiangxi. He initially pursued commerce but unfortunately failed, leading him to contemplate suicide. In the 14th year of the Republic [1925], he heard that the Guangdong National Revolutionary Army was recruiting soldiers. Thinking it better to sacrifice his body for the country rather than continue in business, he left his family and joined the Guangdong army in the same year, serving as a soldier in the 9th Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Regiment, 1st Division of the National Revolutionary Army. In the 15th year of the Republic [1926], the National Government swore to launch the Northern Expedition. Our army entered Zhejiang and Jiangsu from Fujian, personally participating in many major and minor battles. Later, he was transferred to the 1st Company of the Gendarmerie Battalion of the First Route General Headquarters, serving as a gendarme for eight months. Subsequently, he joined the 6th Regiment, 2nd Division, 13th Army, as a sergeant messenger in the battalion headquarters. He was then promoted to platoon leader of the 5th Company of the same battalion. That year, Tang Shengzhi rebelled in Hunan, and the central government ordered a campaign to suppress him. Our army departed from Shanghai and fought in Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan, eventually achieving victory. In the 17th year of the Republic [1928], we returned to Hanyang from Hunan to continue the Northern Expedition, but were ordered to reorganize into the 1st Brigade, 1st Regiment, 1st Group Army. In the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the Gui Clique rebelled, and the central army launched another western expedition. Our army was defeated and disbanded. He was unemployed in Hanyang, living in poverty. Later, seeing that the military headquarters of the Second Route General Commander Liu was recruiting a company of gendarmerie, he applied and was accepted as a sergeant squad leader, serving for several months. Due to illness, he requested leave and returned to Hanyang. Last winter, he came to Shanghai by ship to seek relatives, but after searching for many days without success, his travel expenses were exhausted, leaving him with no means of survival, hence his suicidal thoughts. The police chief, finding his situation extremely pitiful, ordered Detective Huang Songsheng to escort him to the local court at 3 PM yesterday for assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e266">Mr. Fei Tang's Report <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Summary Translation of the First to Third Compilations (4)</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Chinese citizens paying municipal taxes, the report highlighted a noteworthy fact: although properties were located within the concessions, they still held original Chinese land deeds and had never been taxed with land tax. Similarly, Chinese-owned houses in the suburbs, built on unregistered land, were not subject to house tax even if the land was incorporated into the concessions and the houses already existed. The report also stated that, according to statistics from October 1930, there were still 6,780 mu of unregistered land in the Public Concession, exempt from land tax. This represented one-fifth of the total area of the Public Concession. Thousands of Chinese houses located on this land were exempt from house tax. The report further mentioned that before 1897, Chinese houses paid higher house tax rates than Western houses, with an approximate difference of two li during most of this period. The reason for this discrimination was discussed, indicating that in the early days of the concessions, Chinese people did not own registered properties, so they did not pay land tax, and their rent was lower, so they paid less house tax. The intention of having different tax rates was to establish a standard for collecting taxes to ensure that the house tax paid by the majority of Chinese people was equal to or close to the land tax and house tax paid by a small number of foreigners. Subsequently, the practice of charging Chinese houses a higher house tax rate than Western houses was abolished. The circumstances surrounding the abolition of this practice were described as follows: after a certain period, the situation regarding land tax and house tax changed for two reasons. First, a practice developed among Chinese people of buying properties in the name of foreigners and registering the land deeds with foreign consulates. Second, wealthy Chinese residents occupied Western-style houses, resulting in the Chinese paying a portion of the land tax and the so-called foreign house tax. Furthermore, with the increase in the number of Chinese residents in the concessions, the annual revenue from Chinese house tax from 1883 to 1887, as mentioned above, was indeed more than the total annual revenue from foreign land tax and foreign house tax. The original basis for charging Chinese house tax two li higher than foreign house tax, as speculated above, therefore disappeared. In 1898, the Board of Works submitted a tax proposal to the annual meeting of taxpayers, based on the opinion that, under the circumstances at the time, Chinese house tax should no longer be higher than foreign house tax. In order to raise additional funds, it was necessary to levy additional taxes, and the Board of Works therefore suggested increasing the land tax to one-tenth of one li and simultaneously increasing the foreign house tax by two li to equalize it with the Chinese house tax rate, while also increasing license fees. In 1898, the report quoted the speech of the Chairman of the Board of Works when the Board of Works submitted its tax proposal to the annual meeting of taxpayers, including the following two sections: the decision to abolish the two different house tax rates was not made without lengthy and thorough consideration. The reasons for initially establishing the two tax rates were examined, and it was determined that the original basis for implementing the two tax rates no longer existed. As representatives of those governing the concessions, and fully aware of our obligations and responsibilities to all sectors, we specifically recommend to taxpayers that we abolish the various tax rates that were previously considered politically fair and convenient. The report also quoted the Chairman's speech at the taxpayers' annual meeting two years later, where he revisited this issue, stating: two years ago, taxpayers acknowledged that the era of levying the same taxes at two different rates had passed, and demonstrated this acknowledgment in practical terms by increasing the house tax on Western-style houses by two li to match that of Chinese-style houses, without further increasing the tax on Chinese-style houses. I firmly believe that the Chinese community will be very grateful for this move, and that our administration will thereby increase its credibility and respect. I believe that you should not forget that most of the Bureau's revenue is paid by Chinese people, and that Chinese people have no say in the Bureau's administration and do not participate in it. Therefore, our goal should be to avoid prejudice and injustice in administration as much as possible. The report indicated that since 1898, there has been no discrimination in taxation between Chinese and foreign residents, except that land holding original Chinese land deeds and houses built on that land before it was incorporated into the Public Concession were still exempt from taxes.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Chinese citizens within the concessions sharing the benefits of municipal administration, the report elaborated as follows: In the early days of the establishment of the Public Concession, municipal funds were limited to the most important administrative affairs, such as police, roads, and sanitation. There was no major difficulty in determining the basis on which to assess the demands of all residents for equal enjoyment of municipal benefits. This was because, at that time, the interests of all residents within the concessions were largely the same in the various municipal affairs undertaken. The more favorable treatment received by foreigners was mostly in minor matters, such as the Bund's promenades, lawns, and the public gardens that existed at the time. However, the cost of these facilities was not significant, and the distinction they represented seemed to be habitually regarded as legitimate. Furthermore, after careful consideration, it was believed that the area of such sites was very limited, and if they were opened for general public use, many practical difficulties would arise, so it was also necessary to acknowledge this distinction. But as the Board of Works expanded its functions to engage in other important and less demanding facilities, such as parks, schools, and hospitals, the situation became more complex. The Chinese people's demand to share the benefits of municipal administration, which was initially undertaken specifically for the needs of foreigners, was bound to become a serious issue sooner or later. The ultimate occurrence of the issue of the right to enter parks is an example of this. Looking at the records of discussions in various periods, it can be seen that there were two points of observation on the part of foreigners regarding the two issues of Chinese representation and Chinese citizens sharing municipal benefits, which can be distinguished as historical and civic viewpoints. On the one hand, some foreigners insisted on the principle embodied in the name "Foreign Concession." Focusing on the historical facts of the concession's origin, these people believed that the original intention of establishing the concession was to "carve out" a portion of the territory for foreigners and their families to reside and do business. The gradual development into a major city and commercial center under foreign management was largely the result of foreign entrepreneurship. According to this view, even if there were a large and increasing number of Chinese citizens in the concessions, the nature of the concessions remained as intended, that is, the concessions were originally established for the benefit of foreigners. The Chinese in the concessions were "tolerated" "guests" of the foreigners and not legitimate residents of the concessions. The Chinese moved to the concessions because the conditions within the concessions were better than those outside. In this case, they must be willing to accept the existing situation within the concessions. In any case, in most respects, Chinese residents in the concessions were better off than those outside the concessions. If foreigners retained certain special rights, even if the cost of the facilities was paid for by municipal funds jointly contributed by Chinese and foreign residents, the Chinese had no legitimate reason to express their dissatisfaction. The situation in the concessions must allow foreigners and their families to live comfortably and be well-educated. The living standards of Chinese and foreigners are different. There are things that foreigners cannot live without, but Chinese do not yet feel the need for them. Foreigners are certainly not obligated to provide special benefits to Chinese citizens, such as parks, schools, and hospitals, which the Chinese authorities had not provided for Chinese citizens within the Chinese areas. On the other hand, some foreigners advocated what I call the civic viewpoint, which focused on the fact that the concessions had developed by accommodating Chinese citizens. These people believed that the wealth and prosperity of the concessions were based on the cooperation of Chinese citizens. The presence of a large Chinese population within the concessions was of great benefit to the concessions. With regard to various civic obligations, such as paying municipal taxes and complying with municipal regulations, Chinese citizens had all been subjected. In short, Chinese citizens within the concessions and foreigners were partners and should enjoy the rights that partners should enjoy. The taxes paid by Chinese citizens are the same as those paid by foreigners, and they should have the corresponding demand to share the benefits of municipal administration. In the future, as times change, Chinese citizens will one day be able to directly participate in the administration of the concessions through their elected representatives. The Board of Works currently only represents foreign taxpayers and must do its best to ensure that all residents within the concessions equally enjoy the benefits of municipal tax expenditures. Regardless of whether the concessions were originally established for foreign residence or whether their prosperity was the result of foreign entrepreneurship, it is unfair for foreigners to demand exclusive rights to public affairs paid for with public funds, while disregarding the equal benefits hoped for and needed by the majority of residents who contribute most of these municipal taxes. In other words, if such consultations had been carried out, the civic viewpoint based on the meaning of cooperation between Chinese and foreign citizens would have received more support than the historical viewpoint based on foreign privileges. The policy advocated by Mr. An Diesheng, the former Chairman of the Board of Works, could also have achieved more satisfactory results earlier. During the annual meeting of taxpayers in April 1900, Mr. An gave a speech on Chinese education, stating that "doing for the Chinese what we do for ourselves" was "just and fair" and also "prudent and appropriate." The report went on to mention the issue of Chinese citizens in the concessions demanding to share the benefits of municipal administration and institutions that were originally established to meet the special needs of foreigners. The situation had become intense regarding the issue of admitting Chinese citizens to parks. The issue of admitting Chinese citizens to parks was traced back to April 1928, when the annual meeting of taxpayers finally resolved to open the parks to Chinese citizens under the same conditions as foreigners. The speech of the Chairman who supported this opening proposal was quoted as follows: The park issue is particularly difficult because the existing park area is small and the number of Chinese citizens is large. The Board of Works is well aware that admitting Chinese citizens to the parks will somewhat reduce the enjoyment in the parks. However, in order to maintain the peace and prosperity of the concessions, the Board of Works resolutely urges you to make this sacrifice, which is inevitable in order to resolve a long-standing difficulty. The conclusion of the commentary on opening the parks is as follows: When the decision to open the parks was made, a practical plan was adopted, that is, adults entering the parks were required to pay a small entrance fee to limit the number of people entering the parks and to prevent certain unwelcome classes of people from entering and trampling on the parks. After the parks were opened in this way, it has been proven that Chinese people enjoy visiting them very much. This can be seen from the numbers listed in the statistical tables attached to this chapter. I believe that the park issue should be briefly described because this issue is closely related to the general principles discussed in this chapter, that is, the principle that will be adopted in the future to enable Chinese citizens to share the benefits of municipal administration, and that the benefits of municipal administration or institutions equipped with public funds should be shared by all residents of the concessions on a fair basis. This principle is the principle that was emphasized when discussing the park issue. The long-lasting dispute was resolved by adopting this principle, and the policy advocated by Mr. An Diesheng in his speech on Chinese education in 1900 was put into effect. On the issue of parks, the civic viewpoint ultimately prevailed, and this observation also triumphed on the more important issue of Chinese representation. The resolution adopted in 1928 fully resolved the pressing difficulties regarding parks at that time, and the "long-standing injustice" referred to by the Chairman of the Board of Works was also eliminated. However, the more comprehensive and important issue of how to fully equip parks and sports fields to meet the needs of the large and growing Chinese population in the concessions remains to be resolved. The prospects for this issue, as well as the issues of education, hospitals, and other medical services for Chinese citizens, are not easy because the scope of the measures required to meet the growing needs is very broad.</p>

<h3 id="e268">A Record of the Unprecedented Middle School Sports Meet <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Today, people are all talking about the nation. They say, "The country is dying! The country is dying!" They constantly encourage each other, saying, "Save the country! Save the country!" But what is the cause of the country's demise, and where do we begin to save it? I say, the cause of the country's demise lies in the weakness of its people. The way to save it is to strengthen the people. There are countless ways to strengthen the people, but the most important is to build its foundation through physical education. Physical education promotes the health and development of the body and mind, enhances the ability and skills of the motor organs, and indirectly cultivates moral character. In ancient times, our country relied on farming and agriculture, and life depended entirely on physical strength. The Shang and Zhou dynasties fought fiercely and endlessly. Without martial prowess, how could they defend against regret? Therefore, education at that time included archery and horsemanship in addition to ritual, music, writing, and arithmetic. Both civil and martial arts were emphasized. When Qin gathered troops in Xianyang and melted down weapons to cast bells, the lifeline of martial arts was almost severed. However, the followers of Chen Sheng raised the flag of revolt, and the world responded. The ambitious and heroic still cherished martial arts. The Han dynasty valued Buddhism and Taoism, and the Jin dynasty admired purity and indifference. The people were weak and fragile. The barbarian invasions occurred, and from the Tang and Song dynasties onwards, martial arts appeared intermittently, rising and falling. In times of peace, they advocated elegance and watched as the Yuan and Qing dynasties entered China. Our nation withered and declined, unable to survive on its own, which is lamentable. Now, with the rise of new education and the transformation of social customs, physical education is regarded as one of the three major goals of schools. It is used to encourage and train people to wipe away the shame of weakness and timidity in history. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, in view of this, held an 11,000-meter long-distance race this spring. Then, on the 23rd, it opened an unprecedented joint sports meet for all middle schools in the city at the Chinese Athletic Field. For three days, 519 athletes from 39 national, provincial, municipal, and private middle schools participated, along with 43 honorary advisors, 89 staff members, and mostly male and female students with their jeweled hairpins and swaying dresses who filled the stands in every direction. A magnificent and unprecedented event! The venue was surrounded by a short fence, with bleachers outside the fence. The hosts were seated on the platform. On both sides of the north were hung a pair of couplets: "These people come after many trials and tribulations, we should all recognize the models of many scholars, combining civil and martial arts at the same time; this place is the focus of attention from all over the world, may all show the skills of sons and compete for the first voice of the Far East." To the left of the platform was the band of the Poor Children's Home, about ten years old, wearing black capes and blue and white small velvet balls hanging down from their hats, which was very cute. The north side of the field was the male athletes' rest room, with the female athletes' room next to it. Clothes, blankets, food, and utensils were scattered all over the ground, like after a military riot or looting. Order was maintained by the Boy Scouts. On the second day, 200 new recruits were added to the service, and the order was well maintained. Director Xu Shuangfu, smiling, walked back and forth, receiving guests. Ma Chonggan and Chen Yuyi ran back and forth on the track, working diligently. Most of the competition staff had served in the National Games and were experienced in directing operations. At the sound of the gunshot, each athlete rushed forward like ten thousand horses galloping, like a torrent of anger, exerting their strength, competing and vying to show their skills. The teachers wiped the legs of the winners, the classmates held their clothes for them, the crowd applauded, and the friends cheered. The reporters competed to take photos, and their prestige was solid and unparalleled.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Huang Chu-jiu's Coffin Transfer Account <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>On the 24th of this month, Mr. Huang Chu-jiu's coffin was moved from Zhizu Cottage to Yongxi Hall. Although no obituary was issued beforehand, there were still hundreds of relatives and friends who went to hold the ropes. It departed at 10:30 AM and arrived at Yongxi Hall at 12:00 PM. Onlookers lined the streets. Here is a record of what was seen to substantiate this account.</p>
<p>The coffin was covered in red felt and placed in the Jiufu Hall. Hanging in front was a portrait of Mr. Huang, lifelike and divine. On the table were offerings of fruit, tea, and rice, but no sacrificial dishes. In addition to the tall burning white candles, there were two bright horn lamps in the middle burning electric lights. The flower wreaths piled up like a mountain under the platform. The elegiac couplet presented by Xiaolai was quite special, reading: "Dressed with elegance, twenty years of ambition to chart the world" and "Returning to the origin of ninety-nine, empty hands to the Yellow Springs." It not only perfectly embedded the three characters of Huang Chu-jiu's name but also deeply understood and contained Zen meaning. The couplet I presented read: "With the magnanimity of Uncle Du, he was a philanthropist and also an industrialist, his reputation worthy of inclusion in the Biographies of Money-makers" and "Tao Zhu took and gave with discretion, creating a new world, achieving a great world, his unique vision building a talent pool." Soon, Zhu Ziqiao also came, saying that Mr. Huang was fond of doing good deeds during his lifetime. In addition to running the Chu Jiu Hospital himself, he also enthusiastically donated money for disaster relief in various provinces and for epidemics in this port. Because he presided over charitable causes, he had made his acquaintance. He happened to be in Shanghai yesterday due to the Shaanxi disaster issue, so he came specifically to offer his condolences to fulfill their friendship. At 10:15 AM, Yu Qiaqing came and said that he arrived home at 3:00 AM last night. Today, he originally intended to get up late, but because it was his old friend's last day, he had to come to see him off. Each person holding the ropes was given a commemorative badge made of celluloid, with a half-length portrait of Mr. Huang and the words "Huang Chu-jiu's Funeral Commemoration" on it. Other staff members of the Sino-French and Sino-Western pharmacies and the Great World wore white belts around their waists to express their mourning. At the funeral, two square white flags with yellow characters, four feet in size, led the way. The characters were made of black velvet and were very striking. Behind were four small flags decorated with spearheads, inscribed with words like "Sacrifice," etc. Those holding these flags wore uniforms and rode horses. The entire staff of the Great World and the Sino-French Pharmacy sent four ten-thousand-people umbrellas, yellow satin embroidered with blue characters, and embroidered with words like "The crane chariot returns to the west," "His voice and appearance are still here," "Heaven does not spare," and "Painful loss of a mentor." Behind the umbrellas were dozens of satin sacrificial flags presented by Mr. Huang Jinrong, Mr. Du Yuesheng, and Mr. Zhang Xiaolin. The hearse, car number 8034, had a yellow character made of fresh flowers tied to the front of the car. Onlookers along the way, having heard of Mr. Huang's name but never having seen him in person, all rushed to the side of the car to pay their respects to the remains. There were a total of six military bands, wearing different colored uniforms. Hundreds of flower wreaths, with smaller ones carried by one person with two. The French Concession Chamber of Commerce and the Pushan Villa and other groups all sent plaques. The Chinese Pharmaceutical Association sent a plaque with the four characters "Medicine and stone are ineffective," which caught everyone's attention. The men holding the ropes all held long incense sticks and walked, while the women, in addition to having their own cars, also had twenty yellow cars following. After arriving at Yongxi Hall, the coffin was unloaded from the car of the Universal Funeral Parlor and carried to Room Zhen No. 22, where a table was set up for worship. There were many people and the entrance was somewhat crowded. Wang Meiyu, Chen Shanfu, and other female actors wore cheongsams and white belts, their eyes sleepy and drowsy. They said they had never gotten up so early. After the worship, they went to the Zhuangyuan Restaurant in Baxianqiao for lunch. The consensus was that he had been generous in making friends and courageous in doing things during his lifetime. Although the bank's closure and the resulting turmoil after his death, as well as the risky operation of speculative ventures and failure, were different from absconding with funds, it was hoped that his estate would be sold off to maintain the interests of creditors and comfort Mr. Huang in the afterlife.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Chaplin's Determination <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Caoshi</p>
<p>The new film "City Lights" by the comedy king Chaplin, recently awarded the French medal, has comedy music but no dialogue. Countless small jokes are melted into one big comedy, and countless small expressions are woven into an artistic drama. One can appreciate its novel jokes and also appreciate its profound meaning, leaving a memorable aftertaste. Once released, European and American countries hailed it as a masterpiece that dialogue films cannot match in art. However, people know its success but do not know the pain it took to achieve it.</p>
<p>When dialogue films surged, Chaplin wanted to engage in filming his new film. However, he opposed this new invention of science with all his might, saying that sound music was acceptable, but dialogue was not. Because actors, when performing a drama, if they want to take care of their tone and language, they cannot have sufficient expression, which loses the essence of art. Moreover, the world's languages are different. Even if English is popular, it is still not necessarily understood by everyone. Only facial performances can move all of humanity. After this statement was published, although supporters accounted for eight or nine out of ten, there were also one or two who opposed it. Chaplin believed that the persuasion of words was not as powerful as taking a work as an example. Therefore, he made a great determination to use his private funds of US$1.5 million to personally and secretly engage in the planning of the allegory, jokes, material selection, sound matching, and music matching of his new film. It took two years to begin filming, and it was finally published in January of this year. The results were indeed as such, and Chaplin's determination was not in vain.</p>
<p>Correction: The word "諗" under the title "Record of the Origins of the Huan Shang Master's Party and State" the other day was a misprint. Also, the number under the Indian Travelogue was a misprint of "33" instead of "35." This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Record of Character Decomposition <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Manyin</p>
<p>Divination is now regarded as a superstitious matter and is not discussed by enlightened people. However, the art of character decomposition, I do not know when it began. People use it to divine good and bad fortune, and their words often hit the mark subtly. Their so-called "touching the opportunity" is only a few words, responding to the sound and proving effective. Moreover, those who are skilled in this art must also have something in their chest to be able to answer fluently. Therefore, people in the intellectual class regard it as a samadhi of games. There is a certain astrologer in the capital who is also skilled in character decomposition. Every day, his door is like a market, and he writes non-stop from morning to night. A certain friend of mine in a certain institution had just obtained a position, but it was canceled in less than a month. He tried to inquire about it and obtained the character "費" (fei, expense), but he was not told what it was about. He only said that he was planning something. He added a "宀" (roof) above the character "貝" (bei, shell), saying that the matter being planned was related to the government. He added a "母" (mu, mother) to form the character "費" (fei, expense), but it could have been carried through. However, the top of the character "費" (fei, expense) is a "弗" (fu, not), so it cannot be carried through. He added a "宀" (roof) to the character "貫" (guan, penetrate) to form the character "實" (shi, real), and then added the character "弗" (fu, not) to become the two characters "弗實" (fu shi, unreal), which meant that although you obtained the position, it was not real. A certain lawyer was campaigning for the national election and asked someone to decompose a character on his behalf. He also went to inquire and obtained the character "暉" (hui, sunshine). He added a "走" (zou, walk) under the character "軍" (jun, army) to form the character "運" (yun, luck), which meant that this matter was in the process of movement and running (at that time, he was not told what it was about, but only that he was planning something). In the character "暉" (hui, sunshine), the "日" (ri, sun) radical was added to form the character "春" (chun, spring), saying that this could be revealed at the end of spring. There were many accurate hits. There was also a certain person who inquired about marriage matters and obtained the character "蝠" (fu, bat). He frowned and said that marriage is originally a matter of happiness, but you obtained the character "蝠" (fu, bat), and the happiness has been half-eaten away by insects. In fact, the person was already in the process of divorce proceedings. There was also a certain relative of mine who had a minor illness. A certain relative of his passed by a character decomposition stall in Shanghai and saw a large crowd of onlookers. He also tried to pick a character, and he picked the character "及" (ji, reach) to ask about what was happening. So, he asked about the illness. The character decomposer said that the person would surely die. When asked why, he said that the character "及" (ji, reach), when decomposed, opens up to form the character "人" (ren, person) and the character "了" (liao, finished). The matter of being a person is finished. Indeed, his relative's illness eventually did not improve. There was also someone who decomposed the two characters "夏超" (Xia Chao) for good and bad fortune. He picked up his pen and judged, saying, "One" person "selfishly" wants to rebel ("反") (the above is the character "夏" (Xia)). Later, he also wanted to "escape" ("走"), but it was too late and he was already under the "knife" ("刀") "mouth" ("口") (the above is the character "超" (Chao)). In just a few words, the final fate of Xia Dinghou was fully encompassed. Confucius said, "Even small paths have something worth seeing." Truly these words are trustworthy.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Returning, we still passed in front of the Kali Temple, where we saw several wooden frames with many people holding sheep for sacrifice. The sheep were hung on the frames and cut in two with knives, the blood flowing all over the ground. Beside them, cows lay peacefully, and people offered flowers in front of the cows. Mencius once said, "Why choose between cows and sheep?" Now, observing Hinduism, they greatly choose, regarding cows as sacred and offering flowers, while regarding sheep as sacrificial animals and killing them. It seems there is fortune and misfortune. Although they think sheep are useless and cows are useful, cows are the representatives of labor, so it is appropriate to sanctify them.</p>
<p>The surrounding area was full of stalls selling miscellaneous items and Kali portraits. I asked my Indian friend to select and purchase several pages and asked him to explain them to interpret Indian mythology and philosophy. However, while walking, I repeatedly felt the pain of being surrounded by beggars. It is estimated that there were no less than one or two hundred beggars around this temple, more than the beggars at the City God Temple in Shanghai. I remember that the beggars in China are most prevalent in places such as Beiping. At Shijiazhuang Station, there were dozens in a row. When I went to Luanzhou, I passed through small markets where beggars were also in groups. Mr. Sta said that the beggars in Moscow, Russia, were also organized into a brigade. I don't know what the lives of ordinary people are like in Russia after it was red. I also don't know what the number of beggars is like in the north of our country after the revolution. I hope those in power will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Returning, we passed by the Indian Museum. I had visited it before, but I heard that the art museum was also attached here, so I entered through its door again and saw various sculptures and portraits. Observing Indian portraits, some resemble the styles of Egypt, Judaism, and Islam. Their attitudes are grand and close to nature. The faces of women are all made round. Chinese portraits are slightly closer to rectangular, and the lower jaw is slightly thin to express elegance. The Indians are quite plump, but this is not necessarily the case in reality. There was a statue of a goddess using a lion to eat a demon, with two female children serving by her side. It is said that one plays the piano as the god of music, and the other holds an object as the god of wealth. Two men serve below, one in charge of the army and the other in charge of other matters. It is said that this goddess is Kali, who protects all people and defeats demons. Therefore, the Indian people worship her. I saw that even though they are both of the Hindu religion, the White Tower Temple of the male Buddha Krishna is so clean and rarely sees miscellaneous people, while the goddess's temple is so crowded that it is impossible to insert a foot. It can also be seen that faith is easy to spread, and goddesses are easy to become popular because they are more emotional.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, the British lawyer Mr. Mookerjee arranged for me to visit a Raja. A Raja is an Indian prince. The British have ruled India for more than a hundred years, and the small princes of the past are still there. I heard that there are dozens of small kings in the entire territory, still occupying territory sufficient to preserve their wealthy landlord status. It is said that they still have some troops. They are so happy here that they do not think of Shu, only retaining the position of Duke of Anle. However, their wealthy influence is still very great. I heard that there are many with tens of millions of wealth. The British are good at politics and the law is broad, but like fish in shallow water, they are gradually decreasing. The little king lives in a hotel and is very young, able to speak English, only twenty years old like a child. His speech is elegant. If you travel to the inland, you can visit his country.</p>
<p>At 10:00 PM in the evening, I boarded a train northwest with Xin Han and Mookerjee and ten monks to Sarnath. The Mahayana Buddhist Association chartered a train for not much money, only six or seven yuan per person. Those who came to the station to see us off presented flowers to the monks, and I also shared in their incense.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 27th, the gold standard fell again, breaking the major barrier of 740 taels. However, there were occasional fluctuations of three or four taels, and the market situation was still stable. From morning to evening, a total of more than ten taels were lost. Looking back, it almost fell by ten taels. The purchases and sales of the industry were uneven. The early morning was still stable. Almost no changes in the overseas silver market occurred. Later, there were slight advances and retreats, and the trend of foreign exchange became loose, and the listing did not change. Therefore, people's hearts were weak. From 741 taels, it fell to 33 or 34 taels due to speculation by merchants selling. The later market felt even more sluggish because exchange bills were becoming looser. Furthermore, because it was not easy to get rid of spot goods, it finally fell to 31 taels. This morning, the major dealers predicted a long position, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Early Morning Still Stable <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>From the early morning, the opening price for June was 740 taels and five mace, a slight increase of three cash. There were no changes in the major dealers and silver prices. Then, Wanxing bought in, while Hengyu Goods sold out, so there were fluctuations of more than two taels, from 41 taels to 38 taels and five cash. Suddenly, Zhifeng, Yonghengxing, etc. bought in, and Mitsui issued July English gold at 43.75, and the market rose by a halfpenny, immediately rising three taels to 41 taels and seven cash. However, the sellers did not slacken and retreated three or four taels. When the official quotation was announced, it was 37 taels and eight cash. In an instant, Xinxing, Juchang, etc. bought in, and at 9:45, it was 40 taels and eight cash. However, Maccari sold June English gold at 13.4375 to a halfpenny, and Fuyu, etc. sold only a few minutes, suppressing it by about four taels, totaling 37 taels. Later, Yuanheng, Yuanmao, Yong, etc. bought in, and Korea ate spot gold at Dalian at 1.5 mace and 7.25 points. Therefore, at 10:10, it rose to 39 taels, seven or eight cash. Then, it fell slightly by two taels, with only one tael or so hidden. Yunfu, Yuancheng, Yongfeng, Jin'an, Fuxingyong, etc. tended to sell out, so English gold also saw a firm trend. Mitsui, etc. bought July and August at 56.25, and brokers bought May at the same price. After 11:00, it continued to slide by four or five taels, and at 11:22, it was 33 taels. Afterwards, Zhifeng, Yonghengxing, Yuanmaoyong, etc. all dragged in, immediately adding three taels, totaling 36 taels. After 11:30, scattered households, etc. sold out, and it retreated to 34 taels and seven cash. Suddenly, Zhifengyong, etc. bought in, so the noon closing price was 35 taels and seven cash. The quotation was still calculated at 777 taels, calculated from 40 taels to 36 or 37 taels, and the noon closing price was 41 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Signs of Decline Gradually Appear <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon opening price was 34 taels and six cash, followed by five taels. As for the Indian exchange telegraph, it has increased by three annas, and then dropped to 32 taels and seven cash. Hengxing, Daxingyong, etc. bought in, and various banks absorbed forward English gold at 56.25 and traded US dollars at 31.4375, so it rose again by three taels, and at 2:10, it was five taels and seven cash. Afterwards, the pace tended to be small because Qianchangxiang, Xinxing, Juchang, etc. sold together, and the HSBC, Mai Bank, Huabi, and Mitsui did five or six English gold in May and June, resulting in a decline of more than four taels. At 3:15, it was 31 taels and one cash. Hengxing entered the market to buy. After 3:30, it pulled up to three and a half taels, and after entering, there was a difference of more than one tael. Woxing, Tongtaichang, etc. sold out, especially because the spot goods also came to sell out, and suddenly fell to 31 taels. After a while, it pulled up two taels, but the sellers were still strong and it was difficult to gain a foothold. At 4:30, the closing price was calculated at 31 taels and eight cash, and it fell again to one or two cash. Then, Yingfengheng, etc. sold out. Compared to last Saturday (according to the listing), it fell by nine taels. The maximum price in the market was 41 taels and seven cash, and the minimum price was 31 taels, a difference of more than ten taels and seven cash.

In the afternoon, Hengxing, Daxingyong, Shunli, Chengfengyong, and Zhifengyong all entered, while Tongtaichang, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Yuantai, Qianchangxiang, Juchang, Yingfengheng, etc. all exited. The entry and exit of physical item receipts were uneven. The Guangdong gang bought a thousand five or six hundred empty receipts, and the Dalian gang issued a total of one thousand seven or eight hundred receipts, with a total of one thousand four or five hundred receipts.</p>

<p>Yesterday's HSBC listing showed no changes in any exchanges because the English and American silver markets had also not changed the day before. As for the internal market of the bank, it was stable in the morning and loose later, and even looser in the afternoon. The gold market saw a downturn, almost falling by ten taels, and large customers did not have a large amount of deposit and withdrawal, but people's hearts have tended to decline. As a result, compared to last Saturday, English gold increased by 1.25, US dollars increased by 2.5, and Japanese gold fell by 1.5 points. Chinese gold firms such as Fuchangsheng and Dayifengyong have suddenly changed their settlement to sales, which is indeed not suitable for a small headlock in gold prices. It is estimated that about 20 pounds of English gold were traded. Banks such as Zhenggin, Huabi, Taiwan, Mitsui, and Maccari all paid in, but the Mitsui Mai Bank also sold a little. By the afternoon, HSBC's selling intention was still strong, so Datong Mai Bank, Huabi, Dongya, Mitsui, etc. bought it. As for US dollars, each bank traded more than 200,000 yuan, while Japanese gold had only a few transactions.</p>

<p>The financial community is particularly busy with various settlement closures for the large-scale period at the end of April. Yesterday was also Monday, and various special loans and settlements from banks were also very numerous. The Lizi price, however, was softer, and the money supply was slightly increased.

Yesterday's silver breakdown was slightly better. Both morning and noon opened at 3 fen, and there were also 3 or 4 fen for adding water.</p>

<p>The After-Market May Term Price Suddenly Fell Sharply</p>
<p>June Futures Transactions Open for Bidding Today</p>
<p>Yesterday's Securities Exchange has already stopped trading the April futures in advance due to the need for delivery, and the June futures will only start trading today. Therefore, there is only one type of market, the May term. The market sentiment was still quite calm in the two afternoon sessions. In the after-market, the bond price suddenly fell quite sharply, and the market suddenly became lively. As a result, all parties' entry and exit turned smooth. Checking the changes in each bond price, the former market was stable, but in the before and after markets, the market suddenly sold out and the price turned smoothly. As a result, it fell quite sharply. Compared to last week, the 19 good, 19 customs, and 20-year cigarette, etc. fell by about 1 yuan, and also fell by about half a yuan. Only the redeployment and 19 customs spot prices continued to rise compared to the previous period. The spot transaction totaled 10,000 yuan, and the futures totaled about 5.2 million, of which the 20-year cigarette reduction and 19 customs, etc. were relatively large.</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and the situation is weakening. The overseas flower yarn situation is trending downward again, causing people's hearts to suddenly become tired. Moreover, there are many large holders selling out, making the market feel even looser. Most people are watching for declines because the season is entering a dull period, so retail investors are all throwing out empty positions, and the market pressure is particularly heavy. Although there are no large transactions in current yarn, the sales of other stars are still uninterrupted. However, the current surrounding environment is deteriorating, and most of them must look at around 160 taels, but it is difficult to loosen the raw materials, and manufacturers are already in difficult losses.</p>
<h3 id="e290">The Standard Is Trending Soft <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>The early market of the standard opened with American cotton being flat, and people's hearts were particularly empty. Sellers were pressing down, and each month fell by three, four, five, and six qian. In the afternoon, I heard that the three-category yarn was not good, and people's hearts were still empty, each falling by four, five, six, and seven qian. The transaction totaled 18,350 packages. It was found that Gengfeng sold out 1,700 packages, Rongxing 900 packages, Changfeng 950 packages, and Mingde 750 packages. Shenji bought 1,200 packages, Taichang 500 packages, Yuda 800 packages, and Jifeng 450 packages. The closing price of the standard is listed below, with the number of ups and downs in the account</p>
<p>April 1620 Down 13 12500 July 1641 Down 8 62100</p>

<p>The sales of current yarn are still good. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 1,700 packages throughout the day. Among the same trades, 400 packages of futures were entered. The market was flat. Among the customer gangs, Hankou entered 75 packages, Sichuan entered 55 packages, Guangdong entered 115 packages, the North gang entered 45 packages, the Mainland entered 310 packages, Luzhou entered 75 packages, Tianjin entered 270 packages, Shantou entered 70 packages, Fujian entered 40 packages, Jiangxi entered 70 packages, Changsha entered 100 packages, Gaoyang entered 65 packages, and Miscellaneous gang entered 150 packages.</p>

<p>The cotton market turned weak because both American and Indian cotton fell slightly, and gold prices also softened, causing people's hearts to be tired and buyers to lack. However, the bottom goods were scarce, and Japanese traders were squeezing short positions, so the amount of pulling in has never been willing to relax. If the future foreign cotton and exchange rates can be empty, the market will naturally not have large ups and downs, so even if a part of the general trend is not good, they do not dare to throw it out as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Han Standard Drops Three or Four Cash <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>The Han Standard market opened this morning with American cotton slightly down, and the exchange rate unmoved. Prices softened, each falling five cents to two cash. The afternoon market remained weak, following the yarn market down two and a half cash. The total volume of transactions was 25,600 dan. Sales included 1,300 dan of Jifeng, 2,100 dan of Rongxing, and 2,600 dan of Changfeng. Purchases included 1,500 dan of Tianlong. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>The futures market situation last week followed overseas trends. The general trend was towards selling, with speculators closing out large numbers of long positions. However, Omra contracts for May delivery sold by exporters were all absorbed. Imports of foreign cotton were very high this week, and the spot market was bleak. European transactions were not numerous. Japanese transactions were poor at the beginning of the week, but it was later reported that they purchased 22,000 bales, mostly Omra and Pingal. Chinese buyers considered the selling prices too high. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Spot inquiries were very good last week. In the futures market, prices rose slightly at the beginning of the week, but subsequently fell due to the closing of long positions in May contracts and poor market conditions for Egyptian cotton. Prices recovered slightly at the weekend due to purchases of American cotton by dealers and unfavorable weather reports. Egyptian cotton has seen some short covering since prices began to fall.</p>
<h3 id="e299">Rice Prices Suddenly Rise by Thirty to Forty Cents <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>Rumors of Packing for Export</p>

<p>Yesterday, the incoming supply of rice from more than ten sources along the canal was slightly scarce. However, because the weather was clear when the market opened in the morning, sentiment was originally weak. Unexpectedly, there were reliable rumors in the market that rice was being packed for export, causing white japonica rice prices to rise sharply by a full forty cents. The situation was extremely bullish. The sales of Bo Dao also followed, with brisk demand and even scarcer and more expensive goods, rising by about twenty cents. The sales of Yang Xian and Du Zi Xian, etc., were mediocre, and the market was only slightly firm. The turnaround of Yin Yuan was uneven, and the overall market rose slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Shanghai South <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of goods from various groups arrived continuously and were sold. Also, due to the news of export packing, sales were brisk. Changshu and other white japonica rice saw strong buying interest, and prices jumped by twenty to thirty cents. However, here, prices were initially tight due to the scarcity of goods and then rose due to news from the north, so the market situation has a great upward trend. The selling of Nanbang Bo early rice followed the activity of japonica, with prices rising by fifteen cents. The market atmosphere for Yang, Du, and Jian rice was not very refreshing, and the sales volume barely increased by nearly ten cents. The sales of Bai Yuan and Yin Hua were acceptable, but the demand was quite tight, so prices only rose slightly outside the asking price.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Passenger Xian Rice Active, but Price Still Difficult to Rise <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for Passenger Rice was still active. There were purchases by merchants on this street, and Guangzhou merchants also continued to load. However, sales were not brisk in various places, and the asking price of incoming merchants was tight. Moreover, the arrival of rice from downriver was plentiful and prices were weak, which further affected the turnaround of Passenger Rice. Therefore, although the market situation for Passenger Rice was active, prices were still difficult to rise gradually. Among the goods sold yesterday, inferior rice was the main product, so the market became even lower. A total of 88 bags of Jiangxi red late rice were purchased by merchants on this street for a price of 9 yuan and 80 cents. Also, 430 bags of machine-milled late rice were priced from 11 yuan and 20 cents to 11 yuan, 11 cents and 60 cents. Guangzhou merchants purchased 250 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled early rice for a price of 10 yuan and 10 cents. There were no other transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Flour Market Near Stable, Far Flat <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month was not encouraged because the price of foreign wheat fell by another forty to fifty cents. However, due to the relationship between spot goods, the market rebounded again. Because the factory price for standard spot goods on the naval vessel yesterday was only 25 cents, those who had spot sales could not help but buy vigorously. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, this month was still tightening for this reason. Although the distant period also kept up, the faintness of the foreign wheat market made it difficult to boost morale in the end. As a result, this month was higher than the previous weekend by one cent and two and a half li, and May was higher by five li. June, July, August, and September each fell by two and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e304">Futures Wheat Market Generally Flat and Soft <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market was generally flat and weak after the market opened in the morning and afternoon. The price of foreign wheat fell by another forty to fifty cents, which discouraged most people. Although this month has passed, May has taken over. The existing stock of wheat on the market is estimated to be over 200,000 bags. The factory's sales are sufficient, and the faintness of the foreign wheat market makes it unbearably tired (May is at least three li and nine cents and two fen). However, the firm flour market slightly supported it. As a result, this month fell by two cents from the previous weekend, and June, July, August, and September each fell by two cents. October has been opened for auction as usual, but no transactions have been made.</p>
<h3 id="e305">Near-Term Sorghum Jumps Due to Upcoming Delivery <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>The standard April term Kanto sorghum is jumping madly because it is about to be delivered, so short sellers are aware that there is a lack of spot goods, and there are no arrivals from the Northeast, so they have to close out their positions in the market. However, the bulls are aware of the situation and the small number of transactions, so they stand by and watch. Therefore, it initially opened at three li and two fen in the afternoon, but soon rose to three li and one qian, which was a significant increase from the previous market. This is also related to the squeeze.</p>
<h3 id="e306">Futures Soybean Turns Weak <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard yellow soybean went downstream immediately after the market opened, and various parties assessed that the intention to take delivery was weak. The spot goods prepared for delivery this week arrived in Shanghai from Dalian and Yingkou one after another. Therefore, except for a few bulls preparing to receive the goods, the rest all settled at a limit price, so the market became weak. In the afternoon, according to Dalian telegrams, sentiment was even weaker and transactions were rare. Buyers stood by. As a result, the April term was 4 li 6 qian and 5 fen, down by 2 fen; the May term was 4 li 6 qian and 6 fen, down by 1 fen; the June term price was the same as May, down by 2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e307">Sugar Market: Dali Sugar Opens Very Weakly <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from the sugar market production area. The association market drew up the market based on sluggish sales and weak sentiment. Demand was scarce, and the trend seemed flat and weak. The asking price for 24th grade Dutch sugar crude sand white ordinary goods was 10 li and 5 qian and 5 fen, with no buyers. The stock of 20th grade medium sand white on the market was very thin, and the price was 10 li, with Hua Xin goods at 9 qian and 7 fen and 5 li. Transactions were still strong and the market was still firm. Transactions in Hsiu Jih sugar were also very rare, and the market fell slightly. YRO mark was 9 li and 9 qian and 2 fen and 5 li, YP mark was 10 li and 8 qian and 5 li, N mark was 10 li and 5 qian, YT mark was 10 li and 4 qian and 2 fen and 5 li, SH mark was 10 li and 1 qian and 5 li, TM mark was 10 li and 1 qian and 6 fen and 2 li and 5 hao, and J mark was 10 li and 9 qian and 5 li. The trend was flat and unremarkable. The Dali Sugar Factory has been willing to accommodate the price of N mark for the May and June delivery at 4 yuan and 4 jiao for Japanese gold. Gaojin, Fuhui, and Yuyu are all selling, with a total amount of 15,000 bags. However, the market considers the price to be more expensive than spot goods. At this time of sluggish sales, intentions are very weak, and there is a trend that it may not be sold through for a while.</p>

<p>Recently, the source of black melon seeds has been scarce, and customer sales have been brisk. In recent days, no less than 600 to 700 bags have been continuously purchased by the Fujian and Guangdong gangs. As a result, the stock of goods has become thinner, and sentiment has become higher. The merchants have also taken the opportunity to tighten prices. Therefore, yesterday, more than 100 bags of clear water Xu Kui seeds opened at a price of 11 li and 7 qian and 5 fen, and acceptance was enthusiastic. It is predicted that the market will continue to be good in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e309">Silk Tea Foreign Firm Silk Market Almost Stagnant <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market was almost stagnant. No one inquired about Chinese silk in the overseas market, and the silk price plummeted. The telegram did not transfer, and the market was depressed. Only Bo Xingjin bought 6 bales of Huang Yaojing and 5 bales of Gao Bei Jin coarse yellow silk, and the price was generally flat.</p>

<p>This year's spring silkworm cocoons in various villages in Yuhang and Linping all began to be hatched after the 5th of this month. Due to the cold weather, the emergence of silkworms was delayed and they were only collected around the 16th and 17th. After the first sleep, the weather was still cold and rainy, and silkworm diseases occurred in the young silkworms. Most of them did not eat or sleep, and they eventually died. Now they are re-hatching new silkworms and have reached the stage of urging.</p>

<p>The local foreign firm tea market has become increasingly quiet in recent days. Each European firm has stopped trading because the stock of tea on the market is scarce, waiting for the new tea to come on the market. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson bought a total of 170 boxes of needle eyebrow, bud eyebrow, and green tea. The selling price of needle eyebrow was from 20 li to 25 li, and the selling price of bud eyebrow was 16 li, which was the same as before.</p>

<p>Customer Gang Transports Very Smoothly…Price Weak Due to End of Month</p>

<p>Yesterday's market was still stable. The Customer Gang transported a lot of goods. Since the customs strike, the goods accumulated in the past two weeks were all declared and loaded yesterday. The price of goods still failed to rise because the end of the month is approaching and goods needing padding are all seeking to be disposed of. The Northern Gang's demand was also weak, and the Tianjin Gang sold 25 pieces of Blue Flying Fish fine cloth. Therefore, morale was not high. The domestic gangs were not purchasing much due to the busy silkworm season. Yesterday, there was not much change in fine cloth and fine twill. Coarse cloth fell slightly, and 11-pound and 13-pound goods all fell slightly. Coarse twill was more deserted. Only Jardine Matheson's bleached cloth rose without falling. The Golden Three Pagodas have reached beyond 9 li, and the Bar is 8 li and 5 qian. Spot goods are still scarce.</p>
<h3 id="e314">East and West Piece Goods <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>The market situation is unusually chaotic. Straight tribute satin from East goods was suddenly out of stock yesterday. The First Class Scholars were all out of stock, so the Three Friends pattern suddenly became popular, selling at three qian and three fen. Lower body goods followed suit, with Green Reflecting Pavilion at three qian and one fen and five li, Magu at three qian and one fen, and Grey Gloss Twill also out of stock, requiring five li and five qian yesterday. Straight tribute Serge was softening, probably because subsequent sales were limited. Mogan Mountain was three qian, five fen, and seven li and a half, Lie Yan was three qian, five fen, and two li and a half, First Class Fortune was three qian and three fen and a half, and Single and Double Deer were quite scarce. White Crepe cloth was neither honored nor disgraced. Order transactions were active again yesterday, probably because the three grades fell sharply and the East Exchange rate fell again yesterday, so the pricing is now close. Three or four hundred pieces of fine serge, satin stripes, velvet, etc., were traded. Plain silk from West goods and assorted colors were quite scarce, and white striped hemp gauze fell slightly.</p>

<p>The business of French-Western nails has been very popular recently because the Northern Gang of the Yangtze River and various inland ports have enthusiastically received them, resulting in a situation where the market goods cannot meet the demand. The standard is very good due to the excellent environment, so they have raised the price one after another. The total color is estimated at 9 li and 3 qian and 5 fen, which is 1 qian better than before. However, there are not many spot goods in small colors. If you want to match more, the price must be increased by another two or three qian. It is heard that the total transaction volume on the market in the past two days was more than two thousand barrels, mostly purchased by the Tianjin and Hankou gangs.</p>

<h3 id="e317">A Youth's Confession <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Tiehua</p>
<p>Instead of calling it "A Youth's Confession," it would be more straightforward to call it "My Confession," because I am also one of the youth. My public confession may be similar to that of ordinary youth.</p>
<p>I am already twenty-three years old this year. When I wrote the words "twenty-three," I felt unspeakable shame and anger in my heart, and the pen in my hand suddenly felt unusually heavy, as if it did not want me to leave such ink marks on this white paper and publicly tell people that I am twenty-three years old. Sometimes, when I was pondering alone, I always thought that my face was still very rosy and handsome, as lovely as the youth piled on the willow branches. So, when I thought of this, my eyebrows would involuntarily move several times, my eyes would open particularly sharply, and a young hero with heroic posture, handsome appearance, and gallantly riding a horse and drawing a bow would appear in my mind. However, when I looked at the mirror on the desk and touched the stiff beard roots under my chin, I was lost in thought and realized that I was indeed a twenty-three-year-old person.</p>
<p>Thinking of my background, I feel too lonely and pitiful. However, I do not want people to pity me. Although I have tasted some of the anxieties and sorrows and joys and sorrows of the world in the past few years, when I think of turning over the historical records of ancient and modern China and foreign countries, who has jumped from mediocrity to happiness, and who has completed a career in joy? As a member of the human race in the world, I came to be human, especially to work for mankind. I finally calmed down and felt that I was fortunate to be able to reach this point of loneliness. The overlapping scars of the past truly symbolize the greatness of future careers. This great career is precisely to struggle in one wound and one scar. The current difficult environment is also to prevent me from falling, not only to bind me and not allow me to fall, but also to require me to work hard to climb up to the tower of light. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is, even the money to buy books and eat is sometimes worrying, my weak heart is still beating with enthusiasm and does not allow myself to take the path of negativity. Relatives and friends have encouraged me deeply, and I also have great self-confidence.</p>
<p>Although I am now also mixed in a group of college students and it seems that it will not be long before I grab a bachelor's degree, just speaking frankly, I always feel that I should add a question mark to whether my level is suitable for my grade. But I still have very dissatisfied memories of the image that the school gave me. The most important thing is that professors and students are too far apart. Although professors have to run around and deal with all parties for the needs of life, how much knowledge do students actually get for how much money they spend? Regarding this point, I must finally blame myself for valuing the form of a title too much and not really working hard to seek it myself. I am afraid that my shortcomings are precisely in knowing but not doing. On the one hand, I can encourage myself, and on the other hand, I often reveal the flaws of self-abandonment.</p>
<p>My love for literature and art may be the same as other young people. I have always had too little appreciation ability, but just scribbled and hoped to succeed as a great writer. How can there be a day of success in such a blind way? It is useless to just admire Goethe, miss Byron, and dream of Turgenev. A brocade-like mouth can be created, but the stomach is still disturbed and the internal organs are not clear. I am afraid that many great writers will die crying badly.</p>
<p>My cultivation is really too wrong. I have no learning and no skills, but the various habits that I have first acquired will often attack. I want to be romantic, how to be unrestrained, how to show the greatness of life. Sometimes I am drunk on fine wine, and sometimes I want to smoke wildly. I know that all kinds of things will hinder my progress, but I know it and deliberately commit it again and again.</p>
<p>The problem of sex is what I need very much in terms of age, so I sympathize very much with Mr. Ruogu's "Thirst for the Opposite Sex." On the other hand, although I know that my studies have not been completed and there are many aspects that need to be worked hard, I will involuntarily plunge into the whirlpool of love, as if I am afraid of falling behind. Although in the hearts of young people, who doesn't want to have a more decent partner of the opposite sex, experience tells me that the ideal must return to disappointment. Life is complex, a large network woven with many aspects of problems. There must be love and hatred, sweetness and bitterness. How many people can really understand each other? The so-called estrangement will always remain between people. Everyone says this: the development of a career is waiting for hard work, why bother lingering in the suffering of love and forgetting your own future? Really, how can I not think this way? However, I will soon see the people who said such things to me also joining in this trick. I really don't understand what kind of poem it is. Now I vow that I will no longer talk about love. I don't want to suffer this pain of troubling myself. I really want to devote my only energy to the progress of my studies. I hope so, and I hope that I will no longer betray my oath.</p>
<p>Everything comes down to the fact that, like my friends, I am ultimately troubled by economic problems. If it weren't for a friend's generosity to lend me tuition fees, I wouldn't even be able to squeeze into a student's seat for a long time. However, lonely life was already in my expectations. I had already said that it was not worth being self-pitying. I remember having made such an oath last year: "I will forever forget the sadness of the past. It is not worth pursuing the past. Even if the northwest wind blows and my body trembles, it has not weakened my muscles and bones in the slightest. Even if my stomach is so hungry that I fill it with river water to fill my stomach, my will has not retreated in the slightest. I will temper my hard-working muscles and bones and strive to complete the thorny path of my studies, waiting for the time when the Chinese nation needs me..." It's just that a year has passed, and I am ashamed to have failed these oaths.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my failure is entirely due to my vanity. Expecting the light of the future is not a pretty word. From now on, I know how to seize the light that is expected. Not only how to seize it, but also to work hard to start seizing it.</p>
<p>I have written so much subjectively, but I have not exhausted one in ten thousand. There are inevitably many defects in this public confession, but it is only a left coupon for a friend who is following young people to work hard together to move forward.</p>
