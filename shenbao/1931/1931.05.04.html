<p>大盜開荒島　南漁山孤懸海中爲人跡所不到且山爲全石草木不生可謂不毛之地日惟與海浪巨濤爲友山之面積頗大顧無人居海盜梁梅亭爲浙江黄岩人横行洋面已十餘年部下羽黨甚多近年梁盜大徹大悟抛棄其刧掠生涯而一變爲一務農捕魚之良民梁以部下若散之四處不免加害於人遂團集所部即占據此人跡不到之荒島在島内擇地墾種植菜培菓並出海捕魚藉資生活數年以來此荒島中竹籬芧舍鷄鳴犬吠儼然一海國之新天地矣</p>
<p>救護被難人　該島四面爲高峯均千仞壁立而無可以通行之山徑梁梅亭棄盜爲良安然居島中集一般亡命之徒作海國新民眞所謂放下屠刀立地成佛者此次華陽輸觸礁在該島之下船員旅客被救至山麓後梁梅亭率島内居户前來援救身上咸有手槍三四支船員旅客至是知已遇盜自分必死詎梁梅亭即對衆宣稱本人昔爲海盜今已務農爲良民此來爲誠意的相救並不加害如果不信願對天宣誓並將手槍棄去然後援諸人上山山高無路男子尙可手足並用蛇行而上女客及兒童多人不能上山者乃由梁梅亭命其妻孥等下山負之以上</p>
<p>食宿救難友　入山之難各船員至今猶言十分危險指甲多爬落手足破碎者更比比皆是及入山以後見島内地方甚廣茅舍多處由梁梅亭引領一百十四名難友分居各茅舍中給以食物臥以地舗是日大風大雨非梁等救起此一百餘人恐無生望翌日大英輪來救梁又親送諸難友下山其中受傷不能行走者由梁都負往山麓諸難友感謝救命之恩幾於涕零梁言不必謝祇須將本人棄盜爲良之事實請向國内宣述以資證明並言本人將终老於此島矣</p>
<p>英輪之可嘉　大英輪拉乾浦太乃號此次往救華陽船員熱必勇猛英人在激浪巨波中冒險入海甚至馬逹輪打破流海數十里英人仍奮進卒將一百十四人全救上船供給西餐讓居客室優待備至諸難友到滬猶念念不能忘云</p>

<p>Wu Tiecheng Cables Gu Yingfen Explaining the Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Nanjing Central Released the Following Six Essential Points Regarding the Current Situation on the Evening of the 3rd</p>
<p>(1) The Central Supervisory Committee replied to the telegram from Deng Lin Xiao Gu on the 3rd, saying: "Respected gentlemen, such as Zeru, Zichao, Focheng, and Xiangqin: Your meritorious deeds are admired. The confidential telegram of the 30th has been repeatedly read with lingering doubts. The anger of a moment, with words that seem to exhaust all possibilities, must not have originated from you. There must have been young subordinates who, deceived by rumors, drafted a perfunctory response. You are all busy and did not have time to read it in detail, so it was sent. You, Zichao and Focheng, are far overseas, and Zeru is often in Hong Kong, only requested to be listed as a signatory, missing the main point. The specific clauses were not mentioned, which is also telling. The main purpose of this telegram is only to protect Zhan Gong. The drafter's love is so deep that he unconsciously used excessive language. The intention must not be bad. If it were among friends, the duty to advise could tolerate everything. However, what is reported concerns widespread relationships and involves the Party and the nation too much. If there are also a few straightforward people who hear it, they may find it unbearable, which could lead to extremely dangerous conflicts. The consequences are unimaginable. Regarding Zhan Gong's matter, your telegram introduces a telegram from Guangdong, saying that you fear it will cause Party and national disputes, and you discuss it in detail. It also says that Mr. Hu wants to live quietly, choose a place to avoid seeing guests. What we know of the truth is limited to this. Although there may be temporary differences in political views, the friendship between friends has deepened. The desire to avoid a place involves repeated moves between urban and rural areas. The desire to decline meetings involves occasional rejections of various guests. The matter is very ordinary, but rumors spread on the roads, and small newspapers embellished it. Three people make a tiger; the news must be even more different from afar. Therefore, what you have heard is naturally different from what we have heard. Now, because comrades from afar are worried and unresolved, and we also have the responsibility to protect Zhan Gong, we feel uneasy when we see each other, and even those who are closest cannot explain themselves, inevitably expressing it in a passive way. Nothing else is the cause; it is all the harm of rumors. You also know deeply that since the founding of the Republic of China, hundreds of conflicts have been caused by few facts and mostly by rumors. Zhan Gong does not want to leave immediately because he fears that the affairs of the Xie government are new. If something like this is recorded and spread, people far away will feel uneasy, or even a minor discussion takes shape in letters and telegrams, it will immediately be viewed with importance. Zhan Gong bears the heavy responsibility of the Party and the nation and cannot freely discuss it like us, paying less attention to it. If it is used by everyone to create rumors such as the Wang-Hu collaboration, and if it even goes beyond Zhan Gong's prevention, then Mr. Wang, because of the uncertainty around him, could be reversed, completing his history. Zhan Gong's personality is stronger than gold and stone, and he would not want to put this slight stain on his Buddha's head. Therefore, he knows that staying safely in Nanjing and discussing important political matters verbally nearby is more detailed and accurate. Even if comrades encounter difficulties and want to ask Zhan Gong, they can be called upon overnight and respond the next morning, which is also more convenient. Because of these complications, Zhan Gong did not leave immediately, and the comrades did not approve of his departure. This is all. The National Assembly is about to open, and colleagues are looking forward to Zhan Gong attending and leading the masses. It is especially hoped that you will come to Nanjing immediately to share your great plans. When you meet, you will know Zhan Gong's daily life in detail and will be greatly relieved. After the meeting, Zhan Gong has not had time to rest for many years, and he can also plan a southern trip for a few days to change the air to benefit his old illness. We earnestly hope that you will tell all comrades that there is originally nothing wrong in the world, and do not listen to the disturbances of mediocre people. Therefore, what the telegram from Guangdong refers to can be attributed to absolute misunderstanding. We can no longer discuss each other. The 30th telegram was written hastily, with good intentions but incomplete wording. At most, it is like listing a few names in the telegram, clearly suppressing their mistakes. The drafter seems to have only cited ordinary rumors and picked them up casually. Those who manage finance are suspected of embezzlement, and those who reside in the party headquarters are suspected of control. These kinds of things are often very painful in their hearts, but outsiders do not understand. The worthy must always be blamed. If it is used as the material for a public telegram to denounce the crime, there is room for discussion. After our explanation, the drafter must also smile. Moreover, the 30th telegram was already extremely hasty. The titles listed, from the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, gentlemen, commanders, chairmen, groups, to newspapers, are asked to take note, and the beginning says: 'Please submit to your committee for strict punishment.' What committee is this? It has not been mentioned. That is one haste. The high-level consultant, Zhang Shizhao, has no factual basis for what the small newspapers reported. This may be difficult to know from afar. He has never written for the 'Current Affairs News.' Those who have been with the 'Current Affairs News' for a long time are Mr. Zhang Dongsun, and everyone is familiar with him. The drafter did not notice that it was another haste. These minor details are not dared to be listed in detail, but only to give examples to comfort you. Seeing the 30th telegram is also just a hasty statement by the drafter, or has not reached the degree of submitting a request, to relieve your hesitation. Everything is as usual between Yu and Jie. If there is no conflict, the Party and the nation will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. After much thought, I humbly seek your understanding. I respectfully reply to this special letter."</p>
<p>(2) Chiang Kai-shek's letter to the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees says: "Respected members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees: I, Chiang Kai-shek, entrusted by the Central Government, humbly serve as the Chairman of the National Government and concurrently as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Forgetting my mediocrity, I do not shirk hard work. In recent years, slanders have accumulated. Most of those who oppose me are warlords wielding heavy troops and politicians attached to warlords. I can only carry out the orders of the Central Government, rectify the national discipline, and ensure the unification and peace of the country. I place my personal life and death aside, and rumors are not worth mentioning. Fortunately, the Central Government appreciates my foolish sincerity and does not add blame. However, a special telegram was issued from Guangzhou, with the names of four supervisory committee members, Deng Ziru, Lin Sen, Xiao Focheng, and Gu Yingfen, denouncing my crimes. After reading it, I was shocked. If the crimes listed in the original telegram are true, then there is no forgiveness in Party discipline and national law. The four comrades Deng, Lin, Xiao, and Gu are all members of the Central Supervisory Committee. Although their telegram lists the titles of responsible comrades in the military and political affairs, the formal impeachment procedure is not followed. However, in order to respect Party discipline, I have no choice but to request the Central Government to thoroughly investigate. I respectfully ask the Central Supervisory Committee to examine in detail each item listed by the four supervisory committee members Deng, Lin, Xiao, and Gu. If I am truly guilty, please resolve to punish me and submit it to the Central Executive Committee for a public decision and execution. I should quietly await investigation, obey Party orders, and never be reluctant to cause turmoil in the Party and the country. I sincerely submit this and hope for your review. Respectfully submitted by Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<p>(3) The Central Supervisory Committee's reply to Chiang Kai-shek says: "Respected Comrade Chiang Kai-shek: I received the telegram from the four comrades Deng, Lin, Xiao, and Gu, which was handed over by the comrade. Their words are all picked up from rumors and arbitrarily denounce, which is deeply alarming. The four comrades are members of our party and should not use words without consideration. Although it does not harm Comrade Gui, it is the responsibility of this committee to first investigate the root of the matter. However, because the telegram lists many titles and claims to propose impeachment to your committee, it is not known what committee it is. As Comrade Gui said, it does not comply with formal impeachment procedures, and it is even incomprehensible. After a collective discussion by this committee, it seems that there must be one or two ignorant secretaries who drafted the telegram, and Deng and others did not check it carefully and sent it casually. Because the titles of the recipients involve five comrades of this committee, Cai Zimin, Zhang Puquan, Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, and Wu Zhihui, this committee has asked the five comrades to telegram Deng and others to reply whether they failed to check it carefully. The reply will be submitted for discussion. As for this telegram, it does not clarify the truth, and what is said is unfounded. Please do not investigate it further. The letter is retained. Special reply. (Special telegram on the 3rd)"</p>
<p>(4) Gu Yingfen's telegram to Wu Tiecheng: "Respectful greetings to the Secretary Gao of the National Government, relayed to Mr. Tiecheng. I have read the telegram of the 30th. I am not fully recovered from my illness and cannot travel far. I am unable to come to Nanjing, and I hope you can understand. Since the Zhan Gong incident occurred, all party members have been indignant. I have subtly satirized Jie Gong in letters and telegrams, but he has not accepted them, and the indignation of party members has deepened. My tongue is parched, and there is no way to persuade them. I originally intended to go east to recuperate, but I feared that it would invite more suspicion, so I stopped. Now, the whole country is in turmoil and focusing its arrows on one person. If Jie Gong can transfer Jie Gong and release Zhan Gong, then the public anger can be calmed and the south can be stabilized. For several years, I have served Prime Minister Jie Gong with utmost care and to the best of my ability. If Jie Gong can value the lives of the people and not engage in endless military campaigns, he should be able to accept my last word. Yingfen bows to Dong." (Special telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(5) Wu Tiecheng's telegram to Gu Yingfen: "Respectful greetings to Mr. Gu Wen, Secretary of Guangdong: I have read your reply telegram from Dong, which is sincere and deeply admired. Since I returned from the Northeast, I have seen that the red scourge in North China is latent and cannot be contained, which is not the same as the current situation in Jiangxi. I am trembling with fear, and rumors are spreading in Guangdong, which is even more alarming. Today's Party and the nation were founded by the Prime Minister and the martyrs and have long been entrusted to the people. It is a dangerous time to be in the same boat. How can we be like burning beans in the same pot? A slight mistake will lead to mutual destruction. Zhan Gong and Jie Gong have had occasional disagreements, and it should not be difficult to restore their relationship in the morning and evening. Now, Jie Gong and the comrades of the Central Government are determined to strongly request Zhan Gong to attend the National Assembly immediately and discuss national affairs together. External rumors can be dispelled without argument, and the unity of the Central Committee and the intentions of the comrades are understood by all. I love the Party, the nation, and my hometown. I deeply respect and love the Prime Minister's assistants for many years and will do my best to mediate and eliminate hidden dangers. I am fully responsible for all reports. I hope to dispel misunderstandings, stabilize people's hearts, and jointly maintain the overall situation. The spirit of our Prime Minister in heaven will be our guide. I also hope to convey this to all comrades and receive your reply. Respectfully, Tiecheng." (6) Urgent Telegram from Deng Ziru, Lin Sen, Xiao Focheng, and Gu Yingfen on the 30th to all members of the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, all Yuan Chiefs, Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Zhang Puquan, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Jingjiang, all ministers, all provincial and municipal party headquarters, all overseas party headquarters at all levels, Deputy Commander Zhang of Beiping, all commanders-in-chief of the punitive expeditions, all fleet commanders, Commander Chen of the First Fleet of the Navy, Commander Chen of the Second Fleet, Commander Chen of the Fourth Fleet, Commander Shen of the Northeast Bohai Fleet, all ship captains, all fortress commanders, Director Zhang of the Aviation Department, squadron leaders, all division, brigade, and regimental commanders, all armed comrades, Chairman Ye of Jiangsu, Chairman Han of Shandong, Chairman Liu of Henan, Chairman Wang of Hebei, Chairman Zhang of Zhejiang, Chairman He of Hunan, Chairman Chen of Anhui, Chairman Shang of Shanxi, Chairman Lu of Jiangxi, Chairman He of Hubei, Chairman Yang of Fujian, Chairman Long of Yunnan, Chairman Mao of Guizhou, Chairman Liu of Sichuan, Chairman Jin of Xinjiang, Chairman Yang of Shaanxi, Chairman Chen of Guangdong, Chairman of Fengtian, Chairman of Jilin, Chairman of Heilongjiang, Chairman of Rehe, Chairman of Chahar, Chairman of Suiyuan, Chairman of Xikang, Chairman of Gansu, Chairman of Ningxia, Chairman of Qinghai, all mass organizations, and all newspapers: Chiang Kai-shek's acts of violating the law, rebelling against the Party, and treason are obvious. We hereby list his crimes and request your committee to severely punish him in order to uphold justice and enforce discipline. Chiang is suspicious and treacherous by nature. The Prime Minister, recognizing his military talent, entrusted him with the task of training soldiers. Before a year had passed, the Prime Minister passed away, and Chiang took advantage of the situation to seize military power, then occupied the central hub and controlled the national power, secretly planting his followers and threatening his comrades. The elders, understanding the Prime Minister's legacy, worrying about the country's crisis, and loving his talent and courage, condescended to follow him. However, over the years, he has not known restraint, and his abuse has deepened, causing even greater harm. We cite a few obvious points for public judgment. The Prime Minister deeply understood the great responsibility of our Party. Therefore, in 1924, he reorganized the Party to distribute the Party's responsibility to all Party members and to make the Party's power public to all, without any selfishness. He spoke in detail and completely in the inaugural address of the First National Congress. However, Chiang's speeches and talks often said that the Prime Minister entrusted the Kuomintang to him, as if in the era of autocratic monarchy, when a monarch passed away, the ministers could be exempted from receiving orders and acting as regents. Judging by his intentions, he already regards himself as the successor to the Prime Minister. Examining his actions, he treats the Party as his private property. No one is more slanderous of the Prime Minister and contemptuous of Party members than him. This is the first crime. The Chinese Communist Party loots, burns, and kills, which is outrageous. Everyone with blood in their veins is furious. However, in the beginning, they were only entrenched in a corner, with a crowd of only a few hundred. If they had been suppressed early, one division or brigade would have been enough to eliminate them. However, Chiang Kai-shek cherishes his troops and uses them for his own benefit, causing the people of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian to suffer liver and brain injuries, their houses to be turned into ruins, and to be displaced and wandering, without knowing where to turn. From last winter until now, he has gathered more than 20 divisions to make a long trench map, but the general offensive order has not yet been issued. Shao Lizi and others, because the remnants of the Communist bandits occupy key points, often provide military secrets to the enemy, so the bandits can use this map to avoid the real and attack the weak. The soldiers are exhausted from running around, and the bandit flames are still raging. This is the second crime. No factions within the Party is the common discipline of our Party. Chiang Kai-shek allows his underlings, Chen Guofu and others, to use their central position to occupy the party headquarters in various provinces. The leaders of the Communist Party, Ding Weifen and others, are used by him as claws and teeth to actively operate in various secret organizations. Therefore, in Hebei, Ping, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces, the so-called Datong Alliance has emerged. Their followers are mostly violent and tyrannical, oppressing the people. When something happens in the local area, they secretly plot to act as enemy support. Therefore, after each military conclusion, the Central Supervisory Committee receives numerous complaints. Chen Guofu has repeatedly sheltered them in the past, and when they are transferred to the Executive Committee for punishment, he repeatedly tries to excuse them. The original case of the Supervisory Committee can be reviewed. This is the third crime. Song Ziwen is a poor scholar. He was able to be supported only because of his close relationship with the nobility. In just a few years, he became a great rich man. His extravagance is equal to that of princes. Tracing back from Guangdong to the capital and even to the city of Beijing, those who control finance for many years have never reported receipts and expenditures in a timely manner. At the Second Reorganization Conference in 1929, the audit committee ordered him to report on the general situation of finance, but he refused on the grounds of resigning and avoided his duties in Shanghai. During his tenure in Guangdong, the expenses without names or receipts amounted to millions. The Guangdong Finance Department and the Guangdong Central Bank still have amounts to check. He also received a bribe of one million from a certain opium gambling business, which has long been rumored overseas. He purchased banknotes and collected rebates, encroached on opium gambling funds, manipulated finance, and sold official positions. In six years of finance, he has never heard of proper management, and the issuance of public bonds has exceeded 44 million. Chiang Kai-shek indulges his evil deeds and turns a deaf ear to anyone who speaks to him. This is the fourth crime. Although the remnants of the Political Science Society once belonged to the Party, they rebelled against our Party and defamed the Prime Minister by attaching themselves to warlords or using words to oppose our Party since Yuan Shikai stole the country. When the Prime Minister went south to protect the law in 1918, Yang Yongtai colluded with the Gui faction to steal power and exclude the Prime Minister. In 1921, when the Guangdong army aided Gui, Yang Yongtai received a false order from the northern government and personally went to Leizhou to assume the post of pacification envoy and resist the righteous army on behalf of the Gui rebels. Before 1926, the Shanghai Current Affairs News published articles attacking our Party every day, and all comrades were indignant. Now, Zhang is now a high-level consultant to the headquarters, and he consults him before acting on anything. Yang is always following him, participating in secret matters. Other remnants are conspiring to hold important positions. Chiang loves their ability to instigate and uses them as henchmen, but he does not know that they will devour people and even themselves. The schemes of the Political Science Society are more terrifying than bandits. It is no exaggeration to say that the division of our party in recent years is the work of ghosts. This is the fifth crime. The Prime Minister loved and cared for his comrades and was afraid of not being in time. There was no leniency for mistakes and no harsh demands. Therefore, comrades died for the Party and the country without hesitation. Since Chiang's dictatorship, colleagues have been squeezed out, and subordinates have suffered disasters. Comrade Xu Chongzhi dedicated himself to the revolution and never rested. He drove through Fujian and Jiangxi, and his achievements were outstanding. Chiang seized his military power when he was unprepared, forced him to leave Guangdong, and took his place. Many revolutionary Guangdong troops were eliminated. Zhang Guozhen, Yang Jinlong, and Liang Shifeng all devoted themselves to the revolution and belonged to Xu's command. They were all lured and killed. Comrade Wu Tiecheng followed his intentions and devoted himself to clearing the Communists and vowed to protect the Party. Chiang suddenly reached a compromise with Borodin and imprisoned 170 people in Humen for more than 100 days. The remaining comrades who were imprisoned and expelled were only based on the intention to use them and allowed them to act voluntarily. Those who have made contributions are feared by him, and those who are capable are especially feared by him. Therefore, to trap comrades, he must first fabricate their crimes to show the people of the country and use this to tarnish their reputation and demean their personality. Only he can be the leader of a party, and no one can compete with him. Therefore, to seek to grasp great power, those who have been woven by him and publicly tried to determine their guilt are few. Recently, such as Hu Hanmin, the President of the Legislative Yuan, was escorted to Tangshan on March 1. Shao Yuanchong, a legislator, and Wu Siyu, the director of the Nanjing Police Department, were also escorted. However, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Guangdong on the 4th, saying that Mr. Hu Zhantang firmly advocated that the National Assembly should not discuss the Provisional Constitution, fearing that this would cause endless disputes in the Party and the country. Therefore, he discussed it in detail with him late in the evening. Mr. Hu himself believed that his views were inconsistent and was willing to resign from his concurrent posts and wanted to choose a quiet place to avoid seeing guests. Therefore, he went to Tangshan on this day to stay temporarily. However, he heard rumors that he was detained, which he felt was untrue. The latter part omitted. What he said was exactly the opposite of the facts. Later, friends who returned from Nanjing to Guangdong and Hu's guards recounted that on the night of February 28, Hu was ordered to hand over the guns of his guards, and on March 1, he was escorted to Tangshan. On March 8, he was moved back to his private residence in Shuanglong Lane. The situation was spoken of clearly. Until now, the residence in Shuanglong Lane is still heavily guarded, traffic in the alley is still cut off, and guests are still prohibited from visiting. As for his attendance at the memorial week and the freedom of party members, he also publicly said that Comrade Hu could not leave Beijing. The fact that he was illegally arrested and imprisoned is known to Chinese and foreign people. However, Chiang Kai-shek is still confusing right and wrong, reversing the facts, and still trying to cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand. He dealt with Comrade Hu, according to his own statement, only because he opposed the National Assembly not discussing the Provisional Constitution. However, in terms of discipline, democratic centralism stipulates that party members should absolutely abide by the resolutions. However, before the resolution, there is full freedom of discussion. Whether the Civil Association should discuss the Provisional Constitution is another question that can be put aside for the time being. However, since the matter has not been resolved by the Central Government, Comrade Hu's discussions with three or two people in private rooms cannot be taken as a violation of discipline. Even if there is one, it should be the Central Supervisory Committee that executes its functions, and Chiang Kai-shek is not allowed to do so. Chiang Kai-shek threatens with force only because other people's views are different from his. Is this any different from Yuan Shikai's surrounding the Congress with police and soldiers? In terms of the law, opposing the National Assembly's discussion of the Provisional Constitution should not be a criminal act. Even if Comrade Hu violated the criminal law, he should be handed over to the authorities for interrogation according to the law. Chiang Kai-shek and Comrade Hu are colleagues. By what authority can he arrest and imprison important personnel of the Central Committee? Therefore, Zeru and others believe that Comrade Hu has not violated Party discipline, but Chiang Kai-shek has already violated national law. As the head of a country, he does not hesitate to destroy the law himself. Who in the world will believe him? This is the sixth crime. Zeru and others look back on Chiang's usual actions and his recent measures, all of which are based on his personal status and have long put the major plans of the Party and the country aside. His indulgence in bandits and the expansion of bandits shows people that no one but him can quell them. His extensive planting of party members and the use of ugly people is to prepare for his own election status. His control of financial power is to consolidate his own military force. His harm to comrades and the exclusion of advanced people is to make himself the center of the party. Even his extravagant talk of legal principles is nothing more than hoping for the implementation of the presidential system, so that his presidential dream can be realized quickly. In short, Chiang Kai-shek's crimes are now fully exposed. Comrades have tolerated him in the past, hoping that he would repent and devote his efforts to national affairs. Today, it has become a hopeless situation. If this continues, the Prime Minister's hard-won cause, the countless sacrifices of the people for the revolution, and the years of struggle of our armed comrades will result in the creation of Chiang Kai-shek's personal status, and the sinister and false person will shamelessly oppress the people. The inherent morality of our country for thousands of years, which the Prime Minister tried to restore, has been completely destroyed by him, leaving nothing behind to laugh at the nations and be ridiculed by future generations. What is more painful than this in the world? Silently observing that today's Central Government has been controlled by Chiang Kai-shek, loyal comrades have been robbed of their military power, and politics has been divided by his faction, which is increasingly corrupt and hated by the people. Zeru and others are truly unable to bear the demise of the Party and the country with him. It is difficult to remain silent in their duties. The ancients had a saying: "If the heart feels danger, one must not fail to inform." Therefore, we urgently list his crimes and propose impeachment, awaiting a public decision. We only hope that all comrades who love and protect the Party and the country will rise up and plan."</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Question of Sovereignty Over Polar Regions <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Since humanity has flourished and nations have competed for colonies, finding them within their own continents is insufficient, so they seek them beyond their continents in border areas and wastelands, sparing no military force to compete. Therefore, international wars have been sparked by competition for colonies, and they are too numerous to count. Recently, since explorers have competed to explore the polar regions, nations have exerted all their strength to seek polar regions. Nameless mountains and islands are gradually being discovered. Therefore, nations that have explored the polar regions cannot avoid competing with each other due to their respective traces, resulting in the so-called Polar Conference and the dispute over the question of sovereignty over polar regions. As reported in the foreign telegrams, the ungoverned small island located at 90 degrees west longitude and 69 degrees north latitude of Greenwich in Britain has now been merged by Norway and renamed Amundsen Island. From now on, the island will be the headquarters for whaling. Although the telegram says that it may not cause resistance from other countries, it is feared that the question of sovereignty over the Antarctic continent will re-ignite debate. This is also a major new issue in the world. Since scientific inventions have advanced, questions about human survival and national rights have gradually been invented and advanced. Who knows if there will not be further discoveries beyond the question of the polar regions in the future?</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e6">Britain, France, Italy <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Pessimistic Future for Naval Agreement</p>
<p>France Proposes Substitution Proposal</p>
<p>Italy's Reply Refuses to Accept</p>
<p>France and Italy Compete for Naval Superiority</p>
<p>Britain's Mediation is in Vain</p>
<p>国民社, Rome, 2nd: Foreign Minister Grandi of Italy announced today that after France made a new proposal for the British-French-Italian naval agreement, Italy's reply will be formally delivered to the British Foreign Office in London tomorrow, and simultaneously sent to the French Foreign Office in Paris. The content generally indicates that the Italian government believes that France's proposal, in terms of both wording and spirit, changes the tripartite agreement of March 1st, not only attempting to reduce the effectiveness of the agreement from six years to four years, but also increasing the tonnage of ships built by France each year from 27,000 tons to 40,000 tons according to France's proposed shipbuilding program. The Italian government believes that this proposal is a new French act and cannot be regarded as an interpretation of the tripartite agreement. Now, in the spirit of peace and goodwill, the Italian government agrees to Britain's counterproposal, but proposes that France and Italy hold a meeting in 1935 to discuss the temporary replacement of old ships. According to reports, the drafting conference of the British-French-Italian naval agreement has made no progress for a long time due to Britain and Italy's rejection of France's proposal. Now that Italy is willing to accept Britain's counterproposal, it is hoped that France can reluctantly accept it, so that the tripartite naval agreement can be concluded through Britain's mediation.</p>
<p>国民社, Paris, 2nd: The chief representative of France sent to London to discuss naval issues, Massiglières, has returned to France. All newspapers stated that the breakdown of the British-French-Italian naval negotiations has been confirmed. If they can be reopened in the future, it will be after the League Council meeting in mid-May. French newspapers lamented the naval agreement's misleading of political paths and the dispute between France and Italy over maritime parity. Le Matin reported that the cabinet would instruct Massiglières to reject the British and Italian counterproposals, which are identical in content, because France must build new ships and cannot make further concessions. Le Journal reported that the League Council will give British, French, and Italian politicians an opportunity to re-discuss, so the naval agreement is still not completely deadlocked even though it is currently in turmoil. The Times is particularly optimistic about this matter, saying that there is no reason to suddenly despair of the success or failure of the tripartite naval coordination today. Moreover, according to general public opinion, it is deeply felt that if the naval agreement is handled by naval experts for a long time, there will be no good results. It is hoped that politicians from various countries can use political arguments to break the facts fabricated by experts from various countries before there can be success.</p>
<p>Peter I Island, a Small Arctic Island</p>
<p>Incorporated into Norwegian Territory</p>

<p>国民社, Oslo, 2nd: Peter I Island, an ungoverned small island at 90 degrees west longitude and 69 degrees north latitude, is now being incorporated into Norway. This matter has been decided by the Norwegian cabinet meeting. After the merger, the island will be renamed Amundsen Island to commemorate the great Arctic explorer Amundsen. The island will become the whaling hub in the future. The island has long been regarded as Norwegian territory, so the merger should not cause protests from other countries, but the issue of sovereignty over the Arctic continent may re-ignite the debate.</p>

Irwin told a Reuters reporter at the station that the situation in India is better than before, but no one can say that there are no major difficulties ahead. However, these difficulties are by no means insurmountable.</p>

<p>Japanese Lone Eagle</p>
<p>The Great Feat of Flying Across the Pacific</p>
<p>Departs from Tokyo This Morning</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: If the weather is good tomorrow morning, the young aviator known as the Japanese Lone Eagle Yoshiwara will depart from the outskirts of Tokyo at 10:00 AM to make a flight across the Pacific Ocean. This trip is sponsored by the Hochi Shimbun. Yoshiwara studied aeronautics in Germany in the past. Last year, he flew an airplane alone from Germany to Tokyo in 11 days, hence his name. This time, he is crossing the Pacific without companions. The route he is taking is not taken by ordinary sailing ships, so if he is forced to land, he will die. Although there are destroyers watching at any time along the way, they will not be able to see him if he encounters dense fog.</p>
<p>New Laws Promulgated in Nevada, USA</p>
<p>Gamblers and Unhappy Couples Are All Delighted</p>
<p>Associated Press, Reno, 2nd: Nevada, USA, has recently promulgated a new divorce law with looser restrictions, and one only needs to reside in the territory for six months to file for divorce under the law. The law came into effect today, and the number of divorce lawsuits received by the courts here within one day has reached more than 300, an amount that can be said to be the highest in the United States. Nevada opened up gambling a few weeks ago, stipulating that all gambling is a legal business. With the addition of the new divorce law, it can be seen as a playground for gamblers and unhappy couples to break free from the shackles of etiquette. German Murderer Goes to the Guillotine</p>
<p>Absolutely Fearless Before Execution</p>
<p>国民社, Berlin, 2nd: The so-called Torch Murderer, Denesnar, caused panic throughout Europe when the incident occurred last year. Now Denesnar has been beheaded according to German law. Denesnar was absolutely fearless before his death. The executioner was an 81-year-old man, the oldest executioner in the world, Reichhardt. This execution is the first in three years, as the federal government requested all federations to suspend the execution of the death penalty in 1928 pending the promulgation of a new penal code by Congress. However, Denesnar's ferocity was truly beyond the norm, no less than the devil of Düsseldorf, Gülden. It is indeed necessary to execute the death penalty in advance. It is feared that Gülden will also go to the guillotine at the end of this month. The crime committed by Denesnar was killing a pedestrian in the wilderness, placing his body in an empty car, and burning it, and then ordering his wife to fraudulently claim a huge insurance payout from the insurance company.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<h3 id="e7">Telegram from Kaifeng <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: Recently reading the telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Party Affairs Executive Committee stating that unequal treaties are the only tool for imperialists to invade weak nations, and that social unrest, political turmoil, economic depletion, and urban decline in our country over the years can all be traced back to unequal treaties as their foundation. If they are not thoroughly abolished, not only will our country be permanently trapped in the status of a sub-colony, but world peace will also be destroyed due to the conflict of interests of imperialists. When the news came, our sense of righteousness was deeply moved. At this time, when our country's revolutionary movement is actively developing, how should the international community assist in the spirit of coexistence, co-prosperity, independence, and equality, so as to advance to the realm of great harmony in the world as soon as possible? However, the imperialists still adhere to their traditional concepts and use cunning words to postpone and refuse to fulfill the abolition of unequal treaties, which shows that they still regard our country as equal to other colonies and do not allow independent and equal Japan to do so. For the sake of our country's national, political, economic freedom and equality, for the sake of the respect for our country's administrative and judicial powers, tens of millions of people in the two rivers have the greatest determination to fight against imperialists to abolish unequal treaties. All our compatriots across the country should also rise up together and work together. We deeply believe that the imperialist powers will have a day when they are destroyed, and the national self-determination movement will surely be realized. We urge our government authorities to adopt a clear stance and deal with the matter thoroughly. We will not stop unless all unequal treaties are abolished. All our compatriots should act as a shield and never give up as long as there is breath. The telegram is urgent and unable to fully express our feelings.

<p>Acting as Border Affairs Chief is Important</p>
<p>Unable to Go to Beijing to Attend the National Congress</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang went to Beiping to organize the Deputy Commander's Office and went south to participate in the National Congress, scheduled for a month. When he was about to leave, he still followed the previous method of entering Beijing, considering that the military, political, and diplomatic affairs of the Northeast were all important, and telegraphed Zhang Zuoxiang, the chairman of Jilin Province, to come to Shenyang to maintain the security of the Northeast and preside over all matters. Zhang Zuoxiang has not returned to Jilin since he came to Shenyang from Jilin a month ago to take office as the 吉省 party 指委. He went to his ancestral home in Jin County to visit relatives and was soon informed that Deputy Commander Zhang had entered the customs. He went to Shenyang again to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang to discuss the military and political issues of the Northeast. After Deputy Commander Zhang went to Beiping on the 18th, Zhang Zuoxiang made some arrangements for the military and political aspects of Shenyang and then took a special train back to Jilin because he had been away from Jilin for a long time and many government affairs in the province were waiting to be dealt with, so he had to go there in person to deploy them. However, considering that the position of acting Border Defense Commissioner was important, he expressed that he would return to Shenyang in the shortest possible time. It is now heard that both the Border Affairs Department and the provincial government have received a telegram from Zhang from Jilin stating that he will set out for Shenyang within days, and that the central government has telegraphed inviting him to go to Beijing to attend the National Congress, but that he cannot go due to the importance of acting as Border Affairs Commissioner. He has telegraphed the central government to explain everything in detail. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Chiang Tso-pin's Talk Upon Passing Through Shenyang <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Many Matters to Report Upon This Return to the Country</p>
<p>German Industrial Delegation Has Excellent Impression of China</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's Five-Year Plan is About to Succeed</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Envoy to Germany, Chiang Tso-pin, departed from Germany to return to China, briefly staying in Soviet Russia to inspect its five-year industrial plan. On April 24th, he arrived in Harbin, and at 1:26 PM on the 26th, he arrived in Shenyang. The China Travel Agency had previously reserved Room 9 at the Lingge Hotel for him to stay in. Hu Weide and his wife also accompanied Chiang from Harbin. After Chiang disembarked, he went to the Eastern Mausoleum to tour the scenic spots. He returned to his residence around 5 PM. The next day (27th), he visited important Chinese and foreign figures in Shenyang. In the afternoon, at 4:30 PM, he visited Zang Shiyi, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, at the Provincial Government. A reporter interviewed Chiang at the Lingge Hotel. According to Chiang's remarks, he had many matters to report to the National Government upon his return, but as the time for disclosure had not yet arrived, he could not reveal them. He passed through Moscow and met with the Soviet Plenipotentiary three or four times. When he arrived in Moscow, it coincided with the third meeting of the Sino-Soviet Conference. Our side proposed a redemption plan for the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the Russian side also proposed a counter-proposal. The recent situation was very good. By the time the fourth meeting was held, I (Chiang referring to himself) had already set off to return to the country, so I have not yet heard the results. As for the progress of the conference, the Soviet Plenipotentiary sent telegrams to the Central Government from time to time. As for the railway redemption issue, we have lost many good opportunities in the past due to our Chinese people's self-deception, resulting in considerable losses. As for the German industrial delegation that came to China for inspection last year, they returned home with an excellent impression. However, they were surprised and expressed regret that China, an agricultural country with abundant agricultural products such as wheat and rice, still relies on foreign imports. They believed that if China's politics could get on the right track in the shortest possible time, it would definitely make significant progress. Germany, facing economic difficulties after the Great War, has no cash to invest in China. What they can use for investment are large quantities of machinery. The Soviet Union's efforts to govern with determination, setting aside empty talk and focusing on practical work, mean the five-year plan will soon succeed, which is worthy of the world's attention. The deep historical and geographical relationship between China and Russia is especially worthy of our study. In the world panic, with capitalism and socialism mutually squeezing each other, capitalism is not easily destroyed, and socialism's ability to emerge is also due to its own strength. If the Soviet Union's five-year plan succeeds, the world will definitely feel the impact. In studying any doctrine, we must always study it with the eyes of a scholar. For example, reading Marx's theory does not necessarily mean following Marx's theory. Research and practice are two different things. Chiang also stated that this return to the country is a customary practice for diplomats, as he had been abroad for several years and urgently needed to return for a trip. Moreover, there are many diplomatic secrets that cannot be conveyed by written messages and must be reported in person. Currently, the international attitude towards China still does not deviate from its coordinated strategy and is unwilling to take unilateral action. Therefore, if our country wants to save itself, it must not hope for assistance from any one country, but must rely on the joint efforts of all the people of the country to succeed. (April 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Ministry of Interior <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Promulgates Outline for County and District Consolidation</p>
<p>Orders Provinces to Investigate and Report on Schedule</p>
<p>The 18th State Council meeting of the Executive Yuan, based on the resolutions of the National Interior Affairs Conference, decided on a ten-article outline for the consolidation of county administrative regions. Yesterday, it ordered the Ministry of Interior to forward it to the provincial governments' civil affairs departments for strict compliance and reporting. The Ministry of Interior immediately issued a notice to the provinces, stating: "The National Interior Affairs Conference resolved that the Hebei Provincial Government's proposal to survey and demarcate the inter-provincial and inter-county 'flower-patch' lands to clarify boundaries and unify political power; the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs' proposal to survey and determine flower-planting sections and transfer them to the jurisdiction of the counties where they are located to unify authority and benefit administration; and the Ministry of Interior's Civil Affairs Department's proposal to consolidate the administrative regions of counties throughout the country were all discussed and resolved in a consolidated manner, with the principle being passed and sent to the Ministry of Interior to formulate detailed basic measures for distribution to the provinces for strict compliance, etc., as recorded in the minutes. After the closing of the conference, the Guizhou Provincial Department of Civil Affairs submitted a proposal to issue a general order to the provinces to re-survey and correct provincial boundaries in accordance with the Boundary Survey Regulations for the purpose of governance, the content of which is largely the same as the previous three proposals, and should be handled together. After detailed review, the administrative regions of counties in our country have followed the old system of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and the boundaries are extremely intricate, which is extremely inconvenient for governance. As the original text of each proposal states, the Ministry has seen this before and has drafted the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations as the standard for establishing boundaries, which has been approved and promulgated for implementation. Now is the time when the country is vigorously implementing autonomy, and the county is the unit of autonomy. If the boundaries are not uniform, there will be many obstacles when delineating autonomous regions. Moreover, since the case of reorganizing provincial districts has been decided by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee for preparation, it is necessary to start by consolidating county districts to avoid the evils of Hua being separated. The National Interior Affairs Conference's proposals on surveying 'flower-patch' lands have been unanimously approved by representatives of the provincial governments, and there should be no obstacles or difficulties in implementation. The Ministry has, based on the resolutions, drafted an outline of measures for consolidating county administrative regions as a supplementary measure to the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan. On April 2nd of this year, Directive No. 1103 was submitted to the 18th State Council meeting, which resolved to approve it. In addition to distributing it separately, we enclose twenty copies of the outline of measures for consolidating county administrative regions and three copies of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations and request your esteemed provincial government to investigate, instruct compliance, and report back. This is to all provincial governments."</p>
<p>Attached is the Outline of Measures for Consolidating County Administrative Regions as follows: 1. In addition to complying with the provisions of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations, the consolidation of county administrative regions shall be carried out in accordance with this outline of measures. 2. If the administrative region of a county has any of the circumstances listed in Article 7 of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations and administrative inconvenience is felt, it should be immediately and earnestly consolidated. 3. Consolidation measures are as follows: (1) Straighten out the boundaries where the borders of adjacent counties intersect, so that they are neat and not uneven. (2) Exchange parts of adjacent counties for the convenience of jurisdiction and terrain. (3) Divide counties with vast land and difficult administration into two counties or merge part of them into other counties for the convenience of governance. (4) Merge parts of several counties to establish new county seats, or abolish old county seats and merge them with other counties to form new counties. The principles of consolidation shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations. 4. Within three months of the promulgation of these measures, the civil affairs departments of each province shall thoroughly investigate and list in detail whether the administrative regions of the counties under their jurisdiction have any of the circumstances listed in Article 7 of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations, and formulate a consolidation plan with drawings and explanations, which shall be reported by the provincial government to the Ministry of Interior for verification. 5. After the civil affairs departments of each province have investigated, drafted, and reported to the Ministry, they shall immediately and earnestly implement the proposed consolidation plan within the shortest possible time. If it involves two or more provinces, the civil affairs departments concerned shall, with the approval of their respective provincial governments, consult and handle it. 6. If the consolidation of county administrative regions can be decided by agreement without the need for on-site surveying, the civil affairs department concerned shall report the case to the authorities for approval in accordance with the procedures. If it involves two or more provinces, the provincial governments concerned shall jointly consult the Ministry and submit a report for approval. 7. If on-site surveying is required for the consolidation of county administrative regions, the surveying procedures stipulated in Articles 8 and 9 of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations shall still be followed. 8. After the redrawing of the county administrative regions is finalized, boundary markers shall be erected on the newly drawn boundary lines in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Boundary Survey Regulations. 9. After the redrawing of the county administrative regions, the original population, taxes, documents, registers, official property, public property, schools, bureaus, charitable organizations, temples, scenic spots, historical sites, cultural relics, etc., shall be transferred to the jurisdiction of the new area. However, the occupational rights of the people shall remain as before. 10. These measures shall also apply to the establishment of administrative bureaus.</p>

<p>Attends National Assembly and Reports on Henan's Situation</p>
<p>Liu Qiyao Initiates Construction of Xuguan Railway</p>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: Liu Zhi, in order to attend the National Assembly, departed from Bian in Henan on the morning of April 30th, accompanied by Li Zhenfeng, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Government, Wu Dunsheng, Secretary of the Military Headquarters, and others. He arrived in Xuzhou at 4 PM. Wang Jun, along with representatives from all sectors of the local community, welcomed him at the station and boarded the train to speak with Liu. Liu stated that in addition to attending the National Assembly, he would also report on the military and political situation in Henan. The important political affairs in Henan are currently focused on two paths: village clearing and local self-government. The bandit Cui Erdan's gang is causing trouble in western Henan and is being suppressed by Zhang Fang and Li Yunjie's troops. A group of communist bandits in southern Henan is also being suppressed by Ji Hongchang's troops. Self-government in various counties is being implemented in order. During the conversation, he inquired about the reported issue of dividing Xuhai into a province. The representatives requested that Liu make a strong argument in the National Assembly for dividing Xuhai into a province. Liu expressed his permission to study it. Liu Qiyao, a member of the Henan Provincial Party, was traveling with Liu. Liu has recently been the initiator of the Xuguan Railway. He went to Beijing to proceed with the filing with the Ministry of Railways. The reporter inquired with Liu about the origins of the Xuguan Railway. Liu replied that transportation in western Henan is blocked, making it difficult to implement village clearing and administration. The people there are particularly suffering. Now, the people are spontaneously initiating the construction of a railway to develop transportation in western Henan. The route is set to pass through Xuchang, Xiangcheng, Yexian, Fangcheng, Nanyang, Dengxian, and finally Guanghua (i.e., Laohekou), with a length of 640 li and an estimated cost of 22 million yuan. It is planned to raise all private shares, with two-thirds coming from land, divided into direct, indirect, and ordinary shares, and one-third raised from merchants and domestic investors, all of which will be used as capital. Currently, the people of each county concerned recognize the necessity of building the road and are happy to invest. Recently, if the railway construction plan is approved by the Ministry of Railways, construction can begin. I, representing the initiators, have prepared a plan to submit to the ministry, etc. Liu Zhi's special train then headed south at 6 PM. (30th)</p>

<p>Yangzhou Dispatch: The Jiangsu Pacification and Rehabilitation Association recently sent a letter to the Jiangsu Pacification Supervisor's Office requesting details of the recent bandit suppression situation in order to jointly devise a plan for action. It is reported that the Supervisor's Office has replied to the Association, stating that the Supervisor's Office's pacification policy is divided into two types. For organized bandits, the main method is to use troops to encircle and suppress them. For scattered and sporadic bandits hiding in various counties, the county police teams are ordered to conduct strict searches and suppress them. At the same time, the county magistrates are ordered to begin village clearing. After the initial four months of pacification work, the large bandit gangs in the Xuhuaihai area were gradually eliminated. Currently, there are still remnants of Wei Yousan's gang, numbering five or six hundred, who are gathering in the area bordering Su, Wan, and the intersection of Sui, Su, Wan, and Si counties. When the second phase of pacification work began, Zhang Zhan魁, commander of the 3rd Cavalry Division, joined forces with Liu's Brigade of the 25th Route Army and the garrison in Wan and Si counties, as well as the Xuzhou troops, to jointly encircle and suppress them. On the 2nd of this month, Commander Zhang telegraphed that the bandits had occupied more than twenty Zhuang villages in the areas of Bao Wei, Zhao Gou, and Da Xiao Yangjia Wei in the three counties of Suichuan and Wan and Si. There were two fierce battles with the bandits, killing more than fifty bandits, capturing more than twenty bandits, and seizing more than ten guns. Two officers, one horse, and six soldiers of the division were killed, and one regimental commander and more than ten soldiers were wounded. More than ten hostages were rescued. The encirclement and suppression are still continuing, and a plan for thoroughly eliminating the bandits has been drafted and submitted by the Supervisor's Office to Chief Commander Liang for overall planning and implementation. The Governor of Anhui has also been telegraphed to send troops to encircle and suppress the bandits in the Wan and Si area. It is expected that the bandits can be eliminated in half a month. Secondly, the sea bandits in the Tonghaiyan area are currently being jointly suppressed by the 25th Route Army, the Provincial Police, and the Navy. Thirdly, the bandits in the Maoshan area of Jurong are currently being searched and suppressed by Li Changjiang, commander of the Ningzhen District. Fourthly, the bandits in Taihu Lake have already had a village clearing and bandit suppression plan drafted by the Supervisor's Office. It is necessary to wait until the Provincial Maritime Public Security has eliminated the sea bandits in the Tonghaiyan area and the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang before concentrating the full force of the water police to carry out a comprehensive suppression. As for the sporadic bandits in other counties, efforts are being made to supervise and urge the counties to carry out village clearing and suppression, with the aim of completing the village clearing work throughout the province during this pacification period.</p>

<p>Orders Village Clearing in Counties of Southern Shandong</p>
<p>Remnants of Bandits from Baodugu Flee to Lincheng</p>
<p>Cao and Sun Divisions Have Completed Rotation of Troops</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuju, believing that the bandits in Baodugu are gradually being suppressed, and that the counties in the bandit areas of southern Shandong should urgently carry out village clearing and rehabilitation to eradicate the roots of banditry, telegraphed Liu Shuxiang, Chief of Staff of the Third Route Army stationed in Tengxian, on April 29th, ordering the magistrates of Yixian, Linqu, Feixian, Tengxian, and Yixian to supervise and lead the local militias to promptly carry out village clearing and post-rehabilitation work. Liu has already complied with the order and sent a telegraph reply. The Chief of Staff's Office in Tengxian also sent a telegraph reporting the discovery of a band of bandits near Lincheng and reporting on the situation of searching and suppressing hidden bandits in Baodugu. Excerpts from the telegraphs are as follows: (1) Telegraph: Received with respect. I have already ordered the magistrates of Linqu, Feixian, Tengxian, and Yixian to supervise and lead the local militias to promptly carry out village clearing and post-rehabilitation work and report back at any time. (2) (According to Army Commander Wang) All (Telegraph notified that a band of bandits had been discovered near Lincheng. After investigation, they were found to be fleeing after being severely attacked by Gu's division and Ma's brigade during the Yin and Yang days. Many have been captured by the Lian Zhuang Hui (Joint Village Association) here. In addition to ordering strict searches in various counties, I have also issued orders to the various units at the front to pay attention to defense. (3) According to Division Commander Chen's urgent telegram (A) According to Regimental Commander Guo's report, a band of four or five hundred bandits was discovered at the Hanziyu Pass. They engaged in a fierce battle with the Second Battalion of the regiment for two hours. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled to Jiaoshankeng in the northeast. Twelve were killed on the spot, thirty guns and seven hostages were captured. Two soldiers of our side were killed and one wounded. According to a follow-up report from the regimental commander, there are bandits of varying numbers in Xiangshandong, Jiaoshuidong, and Longzhuadong. The regiment has dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them separately, but there are too few soldiers and too many caves to allocate enough. (B) According to Regimental Commander Xu, there are many mountain caves in the Zhangyuzi, Sunjiayuzi, Liyuzi, Zhuwo, and Manshantou areas, but no bandits have been found. (C) The division's Regimental Commander Xu is stationed in Xizhuang, and Xu Ying is stationed in Gaozhuang to provide reinforcements as needed.</p>
<p>Han Fuju stated to reporters today that, according to repeated reports from the various units at the front, the bandits in Baodugu have been routed and are currently engaged in searching and suppressing sporadic small groups. They should be able to be eliminated within three to five days. However, there are many mountains and caves near Baodugu, and there are caves everywhere. There are also entrances and exits with interconnected caves. The large caves can accommodate thirty to fifty people, or even hundreds. The bandits are familiar with the geography, and the caves are covered with stone. The search and suppression work is not easy. I have telegraphed the various units to actively search and leave troops as appropriate to allocate forces for bandit suppression in order to permanently eliminate the suffering in southern Shandong. Also, the 29th Division of Cao Fulin's troops and the 20th Division of Sun Tongxuan's troops have rotated their defenses. Cao led the division's various departments and subordinate units on two trains from Qingzhou back to Ji on the 29th. Ma Jingong, commander of the 60th Brigade of Sun's 20th Division, led his troops on three trains through Ji to Qingzhou on the 29th.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Liaoning Province Implements Business Tax <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Chamber of Commerce Submits a Consultation Letter</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Liaoning Province has scheduled to implement business tax on May 1st, as previously reported. The new tax regulations, implementation rules, and penalties were formulated in advance by the Department of Finance in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Government and the resolutions of the Northeast Finance Conference, taking into account the special circumstances of Liaoning Province, and submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for deliberation and approval. Subsequently, at a provincial tax conference convened by the Department of Finance, the directors of tax bureaus from various counties attended and discussed the new tax rules in detail. Minor amendments were made to the various articles. After review and clarification by the Department of Finance, it was submitted to the Provincial Government for approval by the Ministry of Finance. It was decided to collect the new tax on May 1st and sent a letter to the chambers of commerce of various counties and cities throughout the province to inform merchants to comply with the new tax rules and pay the tax. The Shenyang Chamber of Commerce, considering the impact of the new tax on the interests of merchants, organized a committee to conduct a thorough study and drafted a consultation letter. After receiving the aforementioned notice, it convened a meeting of various trade associations at 10 a.m. on the 29th to jointly discuss it. The meeting closed at 4 p.m. and approved the consultation letter. On the one hand, it complied with the new regulations to pay taxes. On the other hand, it requested the Department of Finance to adopt and implement them. The Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance's order to collect business tax is recorded below. It is ordered that the lijin tax be abolished and replaced with business tax, which has long been ordered by the National Government to be implemented nationwide within a time limit. However, at this time when the tax system is being reformed, there are many aspects to consider. If we do not carefully examine them, I am afraid that we will cause more obstacles. The Department of Finance, seeing this, has followed the guidelines issued by the National Government and the resolutions of the Northeast Finance Conference, taking into account the special circumstances of this province, and has carefully and thoroughly formulated various implementation rules for the business tax and submitted them to the Provincial Committee for deliberation and approval. The preparations are now complete, and implementation will begin on May 1st. The original sales tax in this province will be abolished from the same day to avoid double taxation. However, merchants must still pay business tax on goods that were previously stored and have already paid sales tax after they are sold. They must not deduct it to prevent abuse. From now on, all merchants must deeply understand the overall situation and strictly abide by the regulations. They must also know that paying taxes is a national obligation. If they violate the regulations or engage in fraudulent practices, they will be punished according to the law. As for tax officials who cause difficulties or extort money, they will be reported at any time, and the head of the Department will severely punish them according to the law and will not tolerate them. In addition to reporting to the authorities, the Department orders the bureau to comply with the order and issue a public notice to inform the merchants.</p>

<p>The Wuhu to Wanzhi section of the Wuxuan Guang long-distance bus route was originally borrowed from the Ningxiang Road base. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Government has decided to recover it and plans to establish a light railway to facilitate transportation. It has also instructed the Department of Construction to begin work.</p>
<p>Chen Tiaoyuan's arrival in Wuhu to inspect the troops has been delayed due to business.

Furthermore, bandits were discovered in Dangtu. At the request of various sectors, the brigade specially sent a company of soldiers to patrol and suppress them yesterday.</p>
<p>The rent for the foreign concessions in Wuhu has always been calculated in cash. The Wuhu Public Security Bureau has recently, due to the fact that the annual grain and various surcharges have increased more than double and the price of money has fallen sharply, resulting in a virtual decrease in revenue that is insufficient to cover expenses, has notified the consuls of various countries in accordance with Article 7 of the Public Concession Regulations of various countries that, starting from this year, the rent for each mu of land will be uniformly changed to three silver dollars.</p>
<p>Reporters from various newspapers stationed in Wuhu, including those from Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, have organized a Wuhu Reporters' Group on Zhongshan Road on the 1st in order to connect emotions and enhance reporting strength.</p>

<p>Sentencing of Kidnappers in the Sun Case of Xin Zhuang:</p>
<p>Sun Xiangyun, a wealthy farmer from Xin Zhuang, was kidnapped and held for ransom on the evening of May 21st the year before last. He was transferred and hidden without a trace. Subsequently, the First Team of the First District of the Water Police of the Provincial Public Security Bureau captured Huang Miaogen, Liu Asi, Shen Ayou, Yu Bugen, Yang Jinsheng, Lu Jinlin, Jiang Zhicheng, and others. Sun Xiangyun's wife, Sun Xu, and daughter, Sun Baozhen, accused Sun Shoumei, a relative who had once been a primary school teacher, of being involved in the kidnapping. During the apprehension, Jiang Zhicheng confessed to hiding the kidnap victim in a house in Pudong. The Water Police were dispatched to rescue him. However, while passing through Minhang, Jiang Zhicheng jumped into the river and drowned. From then on, Sun Xiangyun disappeared without a trace. The above-mentioned criminals were interrogated by the County Government, which also handled judicial matters. After the County Court was established, except for Shen Ayou, who was executed by the County, the entire case was transferred. After repeated investigations, a public prosecution was initiated. The Criminal Court conducted a public trial and delivered a verdict. Huang Miaogen and Liu Asi were each sentenced to death for the crime of jointly kidnapping and holding for ransom and were deprived of their civil rights for life. Yu Bugen was given a reduced sentence of life imprisonment and was deprived of his civil rights for life. Yang Jinsheng and Lu Jinlin were each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and were deprived of their civil rights for fifteen years. The number of days of pre-trial detention were counted as two days equaling one day of imprisonment. Sun Shoumei was declared innocent.</p>
<p>Songjin Daily to be Published Regularly:</p>
<p>Local enthusiasts from Songjiang and Jinshan counties, lamenting the lack of public opinion in the two counties, initiated the organization of the Songjin Daily and raised a fund of three thousand yuan. Half of the funds have already been raised. Yesterday, an inaugural meeting was held at the County Chamber of Commerce, and Ban Shisheng, Cai Zhongyu, Bao Zheng, and Deputy President Gao Junfan were elected as directors. The Commercial Printing Company in the city was commissioned to print the newspaper, which is scheduled to be published on the tenth of this month.</p>

<p>Fifth Precinct Uncovers a Major Gambling Den:</p>
<p>The Sheqiao area on Tonghui Road in this city has unexpectedly become a silk factory. Now that the factory is closed, most of the staff have nothing to do, so they spend their days gambling heavily, shouting and betting on games such as "sand crab," "pai gow," and mahjong, with significant wins and losses. After a secret report, the Fifth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau sent police to investigate and arrest twenty-one gamblers on the spot, including Yang Runquan and others. They were immediately taken to the precinct, where Precinct Chief Peng held a preliminary hearing and ordered them to be detained. Just as he was preparing to transfer the case to the General Bureau, a person named Qian Pin'san arrived at the precinct and requested that the transfer be waived. Qian then arranged for the gamblers to raise four hundred yuan as a settlement condition, and all the gamblers were released.</p>
<p>Further Arrests in the Xidu Jialian Robbery Case:</p>
<p>Zhou Jiashan, the chief of the Eighth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau in this city, has spared no effort in apprehending bandits. The other day, he personally led police officers, including Du Bingnan, disguised as fishermen, and hired a fishing boat to sail to Yuanfu Bay near Zhoutan Bridge in Xin'an Township to investigate. They successfully arrested Zhu Genda, a major suspect in the Xidu Jialian robbery case. He was immediately taken to the precinct for interrogation. The suspect confessed that he was thirty years old, a farmer. He first participated in robberies in September of last year at the homes of Zhou Badou and Zhou Jingsheng in Shitangwan. Last month, he went to Miaoxia to rob the homes of Xu Xiaofu, Zhang Yutou, and Amei. He received three yuan. In the Xidu Jialian robbery case, there were twelve people involved, and he received thirty yuan, and so on. After reviewing the confession, Chief Zhou prepared a document yesterday and submitted it to the County Government for legal action.</p>
<p>Establishment of the County Relief Institute:</p>
<p>The establishment of the Wuxi County Relief Institute was previously decided upon by the County Administrative Council. Subsequently, the County Political Council appointed a director to be responsible for preparing the institute and drafted regulations, which were submitted to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval and filing. The institute is organized by combining the existing Tongrentang, Yuyingtang, Pujitang, and Pingmin Xiyisuo, among others. It was formally established and began operations on May 1st. The office is rented at Tongrentang. Yesterday, the director, Yang Hanxi, and the deputy director, Qin Lianggong, submitted the establishment date and process to the county for filing.</p>
<p>Important Meeting of Silk Factories:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Silk Factories Guild held a special members' meeting to discuss the allocation of silk industry bonds. Representatives from thirty-seven factories attended. It was resolved: 1. The two hundred thousand yuan of silk industry bonds for improving machinery should be allocated according to the number of vehicles currently owned by each factory in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. Each factory should reclaim the funds themselves for improving machinery. Using the funds for other purposes will be opposed. 2. Given the extreme slump in the silk market, rental factories should request that landlords reduce rents, and the Shanghai model should be followed until the new cocoons are used. The meeting also discussed issues such as business tax. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Various Industries Oppose the Imposition of Business Tax:</p>
<p>On the 2nd, the silk, cloth, fur, and thread guilds, along with twenty-eight other industries in Wu County, sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Provincial Government and Department of Finance, stating that the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations exceeded the provisions of the Ministry's outline in many ways. Although the regulations have been revised by the Ministry of Finance, they are still excessively harsh and disruptive to the people. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, without regard to the circumstances, immediately scheduled the implementation, causing public outrage. The associations have jointly resolved that they will not recognize the implementation order until the Central Business Tax Law is promulgated. They have filed a joint petition requesting a review and immediate order to stop the tax in order to appease public sentiment and maintain the legal system. They are anxiously awaiting orders.</p>
<p>Shenxin No. 6 Factory Warehouse Suffers Carelessness:</p>
<p>At 12:45 p.m. on the afternoon of the 2nd, a fire suddenly broke out in the northern stack room where the Shenxin No. 6 Factory outside Xiaonanmen in Wu County was storing printed cloth. Fire trucks from various districts rushed to the scene to put out the fire. However, because the room was filled with large amounts of printed cloth, about eight rooms were burned down, and all the printed cloth inside was destroyed. The fire spread to the neighboring house of Zhuang Longda, burning down three flat houses. It took about two hours for the fire to be put out. The Shenxin factory's losses are estimated at around 40,000 yuan. The cause of the fire is still unknown. However, the factory has fire insurance, so there should be considerable compensation.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>New Trial Judge Has Arrived in Changshu:</p>
<p>Gu Yushang, the trial judge of this county, has requested the High Court to resign from his position due to the difficulty of handling cases. Chai Zupeng, a candidate judge from the Wujin District Court, has been appointed to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>Water Police Capture a Large Group of Bandits:</p>
<p>The patrol boat of the Thirteenth Water Police Team of this county was patrolling the middle reaches of Zhoutang on the Suchang line when, on the afternoon of the 1st, while passing through the Lumu Tang area in the Su border, they received a secret report that there was a suspicious vessel near Tingzihang. The platoon leader of the first detachment patrol ship, Hu Jinbiao, went to investigate and found the boat owner, Liu Xiao'er, his partner, Zhu A'er, and several women. Because they were indeed suspicious, they were taken back to the patrol boat for questioning. Liu Xiao'er confessed that he was not a bandit but admitted to petty theft in the village and had some knowledge of the main culprits who robbed the Yongyichang and Yongyixiang letter ships. Commander Hu took Liu and the others to Changshu and reported the situation to Ni Zuoyou, the platoon leader of the first detachment. Upon hearing this, Ni dispatched more patrol boats and led Liu Xiao'er and others to Dongtang City, where they arrested Yang Xiaolao in a small wine shop. Then, they went to Hengjing Xibaishui's noodle shop to check three boats. Only women and children were found on board. They said that the men had all gone ashore. The patrol boats secretly guarded the vicinity, and soon they arrested Yang Xiaobao, Wang Xiaolao Han, and Li Xiaolao (i.e., Wenlin), among others, who claimed to make a living by hunting birds and dared not be bandits. Two bird guns, a gray serge jacket, a green cashmere headband shirt, a toadskin crepe trousers, a serge trousers, a moon-white du cloth, and a white oblique-striped short shirt were found on the boat. The detachment believed that these stolen goods were related to the case and, together with the suspects, were escorted to the city and reported to the team headquarters. Unexpectedly, at around eight o'clock, while passing through Yangcheng Lake, they suddenly saw two net boats approaching. They ordered an inspection, but two shots were suddenly fired from the net boats. The police knew there was a change and also fired shots to warn them. The bandits, knowing that the police were prepared, tried to escape into the port on the left side but were chased and captured by the police. Wu Baocai, Sun Yigui, Li Wentian, Zhu Tongyu, and the boatman, Li Laolao, were arrested that night and taken back to the team headquarters. After detailed questioning by detachment leader Ni, they all confessed to robbing the letter ship of the People's Letter Bureau in Zhangjiadian on February 19th. Detachment leader Ni briefly interrogated them and temporarily detained them at the team headquarters, scheduling them to be transferred to the Thirteenth Team headquarters for transfer to the County Judiciary for interrogation in three days.</p>

<p>Military Police Search and Arrest Ambush Bandits Along the Coast:</p>
<p>The coastal bandits in Lvsi Sanyu and other areas along the coast of Jiangbei have been suppressed by the fishing protection and bandit suppression military police. However, there are still ambush bandits who have not been cleared. On the 2nd, the 282nd Regiment and the Security Police Team joined forces with the water patrols to conduct a thorough search and arrested three key bandits, Cao Shou and others. The evidence was conclusive, and they were immediately executed at the Beiyang Bridge entrance.</p>
<p>Automobile Tax Issues in Various Counties in Jiangbei:</p>
<p>The Construction Department has newly stipulated that the business automobile tax is ten yuan per vehicle per month, and a security deposit of one hundred yuan must be paid. The automobile industry in various counties in Jiangbei unanimously opposed this. The Construction Department convened a meeting of the Construction Bureau chiefs of various counties to discuss the following: (1) The monthly tax for ordinary business automobiles in this county and neighboring counties shall be handled in accordance with the new regulations. (2) For the security deposit of ordinary business automobiles, those that were established before January of the 20th year shall have their security deposit changed to a general store guarantee of five hundred yuan. Those established after January of the 20th year shall be handled in accordance with the new regulations. (3) The issuance of ordinary business automobile licenses in each county shall be suspended. However, the automobile industry shall continue to request a reduction in taxes. Bandits Captured in Pingchao Escorted to the County:</p>
<p>On the 2nd, the county police team escorted seven bandits captured in Pingchao, Ke Xiaodong, Gu Bingcheng, Qian Jin, Ma Tuzi, Lu Sheng, Chen Bing, and Zhou Hai, to the County Government for interrogation.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Representatives of the Jiangsu People's Assembly Request Gu Regarding Business Tax Issues:</p>
<p>Representatives of industrial groups and the People's Assembly of Jiangsu Province gathered in the provincial capital on the 1st to obtain credentials. Afterwards, they held a discussion on the business tax issue at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce. They generally agreed that since the Jiangsu Province government had decided to impose the business tax, it would be difficult to delay it further. However, the business tax law is currently being drafted in the Legislative Yuan, and the level of the tax rate is extremely important. They decided to summarize the previous requests into the following six points: (1) The tax rate should be calculated equally using the per-mille method, regardless of whether the business capital exceeds two per mille. (2) The collection period should follow the decision of the national conference on streamlining levies in 1928. The first article of the business tax outline stipulated that the business license should be renewed annually, and the tax amount should be calculated on an annual basis. Therefore, it should be divided into two installments per year, the first and second halves, following the busy season method. (3) Late payment fines should follow the busy season method, with an additional 10% late payment fine for payments overdue by more than two months. For those who evade taxes, in addition to being ordered to pay supplementary taxes, they should be dealt with in accordance with the regulations on penalties for violations of police regulations. The provisions of the Jiangsu Province regulations on suspending business operations and the Jiangsu Province Provisional Rules on Penalties for Business Tax, which stipulate excessively severe penalties, should be revoked. (4) According to the first article of the national conference on streamlining levies' decision on the business tax outline, companies that have already paid income tax to the central government and those that have already been levied special taxes by the central government are not within the scope of business tax collection by the provinces. Therefore, those who sell goods that have already been subject to unified tax and special tax and their direct products should not be subject to business tax again. (5) Wholesale businesses are wholesale in nature and should be exempt from tax. If there is a combination of wholesale and retail, only the retail business should be taxed. (6) The business license is a tax payment certificate issued by the government to merchants after they pay taxes, similar to the busy season plate, and should not be subject to stamp tax again. After the principles of the above requests were decided, Yu Xiao Chuan, Qian Sun Qing, Li Sheng Bo, Wang Jing Ting, Lan Bo Hua, and Zhang Shou Yi jointly sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan on the 2nd, requesting that the above opinions be incorporated when drafting the business tax law. They also scheduled to go to the Legislative Yuan on the 4th to make their request.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Liu Yazi's Autumn Lament in Moling <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>Ms. Zhang Qiushi from Wujiang has lofty aspirations and devotes herself to the revolution. Her perseverance has always been admired by her peers. In the past, she worked very hard in Shanghai and Nanjing, and was tragically killed by the enemy in Bai Xia. Her friend Liu Yazi was particularly grief-stricken. Yazi is a warm-hearted person. In the past, he presided over the Nanshe, and his literary talent was elegant and flowing, implicitly holding the reins of the literary circles in the southeast. If a member of the society suffered misfortune and their family was too poor to print their posthumous collection, he would often pay for it out of his own pocket. Many commentators praised his chivalrous deeds. How could he be indifferent to Ms. Zhang's tragic death? He built a tomb with clothes and hats next to Wuduo Temple in his hometown of Fenhu, and commissioned Chen Shuren and other faithful artists to paint two "Autumn Lament in Moling" paintings, widely soliciting poems and inscriptions. Many Chinese compatriots donated their own poems and inscriptions. Yazi successively composed more than a hundred poems, sighing repeatedly with tears of blood. I especially love to read his lyrics in the tune of "Touching the Fish" in the style of Ms. Lu Bicheng's "Elegy for London." Yazi's grief and indignation fill his chest, and his determination to avenge his friend is like ten thousand rays of golden light, with the aura of a sword piercing the sky, fully revealed between the lines. If Qiushi had any knowledge after her death, she would be grateful to her confidant, which would bring her some comfort and allow her to close her eyes in peace. The lyrics say: "Sigh, the west wind blows again in Bai Xia, the tomb of Pingling is filled with yellow calves, sadly playing the national anthem, how much blood of Chang Hong. Not the beans cooked from the same stalk, the turmoil suddenly pains a generation of beautiful women. To die at the hands of a brute is a disgrace. Heaven does not grant longevity to the upright. The round figure of the moon is replaced by the heroic figure of the cloud. At the age of thirty-nine, she knocks on the door to ask. At the time of the wailing at the new pavilion, Bo Ren pitied me for lightly betraying Ma Wei, the white silk strangled her throat, a tragic end, more shameful than a man's beheading. I resent my sleeves. Alas, the dragon sword is buried and cannot be drawn to take the enemy's head. Will the hero repent? But the bells and fish of Tongtai, the cool Brahmin chants, piously worship the King of Emptiness."</p>
<h3 id="e21">New Citizens of the Sea Rescue Friends in Distress <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Wei</p>
<p>The Huayang ship of the Hang'an Company had an accident in the waters of Wenzhou. Details have been published in major newspapers. Yesterday, Zhang Jisheng, the second buyer on board the ship, returned to Shanghai and said that the lives of all the people on board were saved by pirates. Otherwise, everyone would have died. The incident was so strange that I recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>Pirates Reclaim the Desert Island:</p>
<p>Nan Yushan is isolated in the sea and inaccessible. The mountain is all stone, with no grass or trees growing, so it can be called a barren land. Every day, it is only friends with the waves and giant waves. The area of the mountain is quite large, but no one lives there. Liang Meiting, a pirate from Huangyan, Zhejiang, has been rampaging the ocean for more than ten years. He has many followers. In recent years, Liang has had a great change of heart and abandoned his life of robbery, transforming himself into a good citizen engaged in farming and fishing. Fearing that his followers would harm others if they were scattered, Liang gathered his subordinates and occupied this inaccessible desert island. He chose a place on the island to cultivate land, plant vegetables, and cultivate fruit, and went to sea to fish for a living. Over the years, the thatched huts with bamboo fences on this desert island have been filled with the crowing of chickens and the barking of dogs, becoming a new world on the sea.</p>
<p>Rescuing the Distressed:</p>
<p>The island is surrounded by high peaks, all with thousand-foot cliffs and no mountain paths that can be traversed. Liang Meiting abandoned his life of piracy and lived peacefully on the island, gathering a group of desperados to become new citizens of the sea. He is truly one who "lays down the butcher knife and becomes a Buddha on the spot." This time, the Huayang ship ran aground below the island. After the crew and passengers were rescued to the foot of the mountain, Liang Meiting led the residents of the island to rescue them. They all had three or four pistols on their bodies. The crew and passengers knew that they had met pirates and resigned themselves to death. To their surprise, Liang Meiting immediately declared to the crowd that he used to be a pirate but now he farms and is a good citizen. He came to rescue them sincerely and would not harm them. If they did not believe him, he was willing to swear to heaven and abandon his pistols. Then, he helped them up the mountain. The mountain was high and there was no road. Men could still use their hands and feet to climb like snakes, but many female passengers and children could not climb the mountain. Therefore, Liang Meiting ordered his wives and children to go down the mountain and carry them up on their backs.</p>
<p>Providing Food and Shelter to Friends in Distress:</p>
<p>The crew members still say that it was very dangerous to enter the mountain. Many of their fingernails fell off and their hands and feet were broken. After entering the mountain, they saw that the island was very large and had many thatched huts. Liang Meiting led one hundred and fourteen distressed friends to live in the thatched huts, providing them with food and bedding on the ground. That day, there was a strong wind and heavy rain. If Liang and his people had not rescued them, these hundred or so people would have had no hope of survival. The next day, the British ship came to rescue them. Liang personally escorted the distressed friends down the mountain. Those who were injured and could not walk were carried to the foot of the mountain by Liang. The distressed friends were so grateful for his life-saving grace that they were almost in tears. Liang said that there was no need to thank him. He only needed them to publicize the fact that he had abandoned his life of piracy and become a good citizen in their country to prove it. He also said that he would spend the rest of his life on this island.</p>
<p>The Commendable British Ship:</p>
<p>The British ship "La Qianpu Tai Nai" bravely ventured into the sea amidst the turbulent waves to rescue the crew of the Huayang ship. The British even broke the motorboat several tens of miles into the sea, but they continued to advance and finally rescued all one hundred and fourteen people onto the ship, providing them with Western food and letting them stay in the guest rooms, treating them with great care. The distressed friends were still unable to forget this even after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Friends' Travel Group Photo Exhibition <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shouren</p>
<p>Photography is the most common art of modern times. Lovers of beauty regard it as an artistic tool. Those who delve into this art must first have a thorough understanding of its theory and technique, and then expand their innate aesthetic concepts through experience in order to express aesthetic feelings within the capabilities of photography. It cannot be achieved overnight, nor can it be faked. However, the application of photography is so wide that it is not as difficult as art photography to gain a glimpse of its secrets. In modern times, with the perfection of camera mechanics, those who know a little about it only need to open and close the lens to capture historical relics, scenic spots, buildings with historical value, and customs, human relationships, and social life with interest. The viewers are as if they are personally experiencing it. This is the special strength of photography and the goal of most photographers.</p>
<p>The Friends' Travel Group aims to use travel as a way to increase knowledge, and there are many members, including many skilled photographers. Every time they travel to a place, they obtain several fine photos, but they do not publicize them, limiting themselves to mutual appreciation among the members. Recently, in order to increase the interest in travel, they have collected about two hundred frames of films of famous scenic spots and historical sites taken by group members, and will hold the first Travel Photography Achievement Exhibition at the Guohuo Department Store (formerly the City Hall) on Nanjing Road from the 4th to the 6th of this month. The exhibition is planned by the group's staff members Yao Yuangan, Zheng Jiaguan, Shao Woyun, and Guo Xiqi. They also consulted with the Hu Boxiang and Boxian brothers, and I also participated in everything. Zhang Zhenhou and Zhang Zhongshan, giants of the Chinese community, and others have been specially invited to exhibit their works. In addition, Yu Pingke, Zhang Shaotang, Zhu Beigeng, and others have participated with excellent works (Juan Weng also has four recent works participating). Others, such as Lang Jingshan and Wang Dafo, have not had time to print their works due to the sudden rush of time and will wait for the second exhibition. Among the exhibits, the most numerous domestic scenes are from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, while there are also considerable works from Sichuan, Guangdong, Yan, and Lu provinces. Foreign scenes include India, Siam, Japan, and other places, all of which are souvenirs brought back by the group members' travels. Each frame is accompanied by an explanation. Reading the detailed illustrations is like wandering through the mountains and rivers. Those who do not have time to travel, why not take the time to visit, increase their knowledge, expand their horizons, and wash away the dust from their minds in the face of famous mountains and beautiful waters?</p>
<h3 id="e23">Hu Pu'an's Poet's Ambition <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Xiexiong</p>
<p>Hu Yunyu, the Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, whose style name is Pu'an, is originally from Jing County, Anhui Province. Hu tilled the land himself from a young age, satisfied and without complaint. Later, because his hometown was plagued by bandits, he lived on the sea for many years. He did not want to live a city life. He was proficient in Chinese classics and served as a professor at various universities and in railway affairs. He never tired of serving the public and learning. Last spring, Ye Chucang, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, repeatedly invited him to take charge of the Jiangsu government. Hu repeatedly declined but was unsuccessful. After taking office, he maintained his integrity and self-discipline. This is where his reputation as "not loving money is the first achievement" came from. Hu is a passionate drinker and has always had a high tolerance for alcohol. Since he has been in charge of the Jiangsu government, his official duties have been laborious, and he has occasionally suffered from intestinal ailments, which have come and gone. Recently, he has abstained from alcohol for a long time. In the eastern corner of Hu's office, there are several thatched huts. He often rests there during his spare time, enjoying poetry and literature. Recently, he wrote four poems in the style of the Shanjian Xie Yao Gan and other rhymes, expressing his hatred for evil and his resentment towards the world. The poet's ambition is truly subtle and extraordinary, like a white crane soaring in the sky. The original poems are attached below and are divided into rhymes such as Yamen Zhai San Liang Jian, which are used in the Shanjian Xie Yao Gan and other rhymes.</p>
<p>[Poem 1]</p>
<p>Having three or two rooms in the Yamen, books accompany me and I am not stingy. It is always like this north and south of the Yangtze River, and I have traveled east and west for several times during the day.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to have flowers in the courtyard for my own enjoyment, and there are many difficulties in the four directions that are always related to me. Jin Jiao, Beigu, and San Shan are there, why use money to buy another mountain?</p>
<p>[Poem 2]</p>
<p>I am ashamed of not having the talent to manage the great help, and I am worried that I cannot descend. The rugged road turns into a winding path, and the sky is bleak with the shadows of wild geese.</p>
<p>I have already sighed that writing has misguided me into the world, and I have only burdened myself with wine to dispel my sorrow. The sound of beauty is cut off from a thousand miles away, and the spring waves are vast and green.</p>
<p>[Poem 3]</p>
<p>From afar, I pity my good homeland and nest, and the millet and millet are desolate on the path. Birds come to peck at the fruit in vain in search of food, and people have gone to plant melons and there are no gourds.</p>
<p>I am used to the house on the water, and my mother is busy divining. I also consider serving as an official only to be ridiculed. Last night, the spring breeze brought news, and the plum blossoms in the east garden are in bud.</p>
<p>[Poem 4]</p>
<p>Why abandon my talents to make a living and live up to the people of this place? I have fortunately entrusted myself to friends to comfort myself occasionally. I often compose poetry and find it difficult to remain silent, especially when I am sick and think of my hometown. I have other worries to entrust to my pillow.</p>
<p>I have tasted all the bitterness and hardship of the world, and I know that simple food is better than salt.</p>
<h3 id="e24">India Travelogue (42) <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the twenty-fifth, a Western woman took me by car to the Sarnath Mahayana Buddhist Assembly and Buddhist University. The Western woman is a Buddhist. Sarnath is where the Buddha first turned the wheel of Dharma and taught the five bhikkus. It is separated from Varanasi by a river. The river is named after a certain god's wife. From Benaras to Sarnath is about six English miles. The scenery outside the city along the way is quite scenic. Near Deer Garden, there are many mango trees forming forests. There are not many old houses, but the university has been built on a large scale. Currently, there are two monks and seven or eight disciples living here. There are no mountains, but it is a plain. In the past, it was called Deer Garden. Today, I still saw a deer nearby. Its horns did not take the usual shape, but rather formed a spiral, black in color. My visit to Deer Garden is different from my visit to Gaya. My trip to Gaya was specifically to visit the Buddha's relics, while my trip to Deer Garden was very hurried and I did not have time to examine it in detail. In short, when the Buddha first attained enlightenment, if he was speaking about the Avatamsaka Sutra, then Gaya was the place where he taught the Avatamsaka Sutra, while Deer Garden was the place where he taught the Small Vehicle scriptures, the Four Agamas. There is also a museum, which was established by the British to collect many broken pagodas and statues. Because I did not have time to examine the Buddha's relics in detail, I returned to Varanasi. The name of Varanasi is also detailed in the Lotus Sutra and other scriptures. I wrote a poem to commemorate it: "Before Deer Garden, I met a young deer, in the city of Varanasi, I visited a famous monk. All the tides return to the ocean, there will be an elephant king who should rise in response to the times."</p>
<p>On the twenty-sixth, I visited an Indian religious library. The religion has a Ramakrishna sect, which is a large sect in recent years. I first heard that a certain American woman was spreading its teachings. I also read the American woman's book and did not think it was unusual. When I read the biography written by the French Romain Rolland at the library, I realized that Krishna was a very unusual person. Romain Rolland is a famous world peace activist today. It can be said that Indian scholarship has the power to dominate the world. This sect was founded by his disciple Vivekananda. Vivekananda's statue is very majestic and sold everywhere. I have not yet studied its content. Recently, the statue makers have included him with Gandhi and Tagore as three heroes, but both teacher and disciple have died. In the evening, I walked along the Ganges under the moonlight. All my hospitality here is provided by Lawyer Mukherjee.</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Turning Point in the Hawthorne Case (3) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>I had walked past more than a dozen storefronts on Qinghai Road when I suddenly seemed to hear faint footsteps following me from afar. At that time, I absolutely did not expect any danger or strange encounters. I was wearing a domestically produced spring tweed suit, and there was no large sum of money in my pockets. Moreover, I was carrying a black steel pistol in my pants pocket, so if any ignorant robbers had the nerve to try to touch me, they wouldn't necessarily get away with it. At this time, it was about half past eleven. Although Qinghai Road was quiet, Huanghe Road was still bustling with traffic. In fact, there was no reason to expect any accidents. While I was thinking quietly, I continued to walk slowly. The drowsiness in my mind had indeed lessened quite a bit, so I thought about having a cigarette. I took out a cigarette, paused slightly, struck a match, and started to smoke. However, the footsteps behind me seemed to quicken, getting closer and closer. Could I turn around and take a look? That was, of course, my prerogative, but at that awkward moment, such a turning movement would be seen as a sign of weakness and felt inappropriate. When my right hand threw the match's spent stub into the street, I took the opportunity to tilt my head and glance at the sidewalk behind me. What my optic nerve reported to my brain was a man of similar build to myself, wearing a suit, with a gray checkered spring jacket and chestnut-colored trousers underneath, and a dark brown bowler hat on his head. Both hands were tucked into the pockets of his jacket. This man seemed to be walking with his head down, and his steps were indeed very quick, only two or three steps away from me. This man's demeanor, except for his deliberately hurried pace which was somewhat suspicious, had nothing particularly out of the ordinary. I certainly shouldn't do anything rash, but amidst my perfect composure and ease, I couldn't help but be somewhat wary. While I wasn't afraid of robbers, I couldn't help but guard against detectives. As for adversaries in a relative position, in the past twenty years, I don't know how many extremely vicious and insidious criminals have fallen into our hands. It's not impossible that these people hold grudges and are secretly looking for opportunities to retaliate. Therefore, I deliberately slowed down my pace, preparing to let him pass first. My right hand involuntarily reached into my pants pocket.</p>

<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>Black Dust and White Powder Flying Everywhere</p>
<p>The wind was stronger in the afternoon and the weather was also hot. Dust was flying everywhere on the field. Spectators standing for a long time were either shouting that they couldn't open their eyes, or shouting that the dust was choking them, or shouting that their legs were sore. Especially for fashionable women, the red rouge and white powder that they put on before leaving home were exposed to the sun for a long time, plus a day of hot sweat, yellow oil, and a day of black dust in the strong wind. The misery was beyond description.</p>
<p>The Referee Only Asks About Today</p>
<p>After the results of the Men's Division B 200-meter final were announced, the height of the second-place winner, number 256, was measured. Because he was half an inch too tall, the referee reported that he was disqualified. He protested, "You didn't say I was too tall during yesterday's semifinal. Now you suddenly say I'm too tall. How could I have grown half an inch overnight?" The referee said, "I only ask about today."</p>
<p>Making the Defeated Feel Awkward</p>
<p>Director Hu is enthusiastic about sports. Despite his busy political affairs, he comes to the venue every day to watch the games. He sees the athletes and cheering squads, one group singing like orioles and swallows, and the other group roaring like the sea and mountains. Coincidentally, a reporter from this newspaper was nearby. Director Hu said to the reporter, "Cheering squads can only be used to cheer. Calling out cheers during athletic actions is acceptable. But calling out cheers after announcing the winners makes the defeated feel awkward. It is not the behavior of a virtuous person." These words are quite sufficient to advise those involved in sports.</p>

<p>Spectators Crush the Barrier</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and there were probably 100,000 spectators in the entire venue. Although order was maintained by Boy Scouts and military police, the situation outside the venue was not as good. Many people were standing on the surrounding fences and orange crates. Even the reporter's seating area had people standing on the collapsing reed mat partitions and desks, making it difficult to prevent. Cigarette ashes and leftover food were scattered everywhere, creating a mess. The reporter could only endure and write quickly while hunched over his desk.</p>
<p>100-Meter Race with a Tin Can</p>
<p>Before the resting area for female athletes on the left corner of the podium, a tin can was placed on the field. At 1 PM, driven by the wind, it began its solitary 150-meter race. The sound of the can was sonorous, like a brass drum in the music, attracting the attention of the entire venue. Its speed was quite consistent. Although the time was not recorded when it reached the finish line, it was estimated to be around 3 minutes. The referee, because its speed was too slow, cancelled its qualification and expelled it from the venue.</p>
<p>200-Meter Race with a Military Cap</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes after the 100-meter race with the tin can, the 200-meter race with the military cap began. The starting point was also on the left corner of the podium. However, during the race with the military cap, there was a supervisor following behind to monitor the cap. The cap was round, and it rolled forward while racing, with a speed faster than the tin can. Its owner initially watched from behind. Seeing that it was going off course and running outside the area it should be running in, he went forward to try to correct it. However, the military cap was running enthusiastically and did not obey orders. Its owner then threatened it with a gun and knife. Only then did it become fearful and stop, allowing its fate to be decided.</p>

<p>Inspection Details</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, all the inspection troops had already formed up. Wearing military uniforms and carrying sticks, they marched in formation. The sound of trumpets and the sight of flags shook the mountains. After the formation was completed, the General Commander ordered the flag to be raised. The national flag rose in the center of the venue, and the military music competed. The entire venue stood solemnly and stared, showing the utmost respect. After the ceremony, the grand inspection began. The troops marched around the venue in single file, paying attention to the inspection stand. After each troop finished performing, they lined up under the stand and received an address.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Tong Xingbai of the Presidium reported that the Scouts in the city are usually located in various schools or organizations and have few opportunities to learn from each other. Therefore, the purpose of holding the grand inspection is to allow each other to learn from each other and to demonstrate the skills and techniques learned in peacetime. Although the city has held two inspections, they have all relied on the leadership of the party and government organs. This is the first time that the Scouts have taken action on their own. The achievements of the Shanghai Scouts today are all due to the support of the party and government organs. Therefore, the Scouts should continue to work hard and not disappoint the expectations of all parties.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang was in Beijing today and was represented by Luo Jingyou, Chief of the Second Section, who delivered a speech stating that in addition to the general significance, this grand inspection of the Scouts also has a significant meaning, which is that it coincides with the May 3rd Memorial and the upcoming opening of the National Assembly. The former is due to weakness and humiliation, while the latter is the future vitality of China. Both revenge and construction depend on organized and heroic Scouts.</p>
<p>Address from the Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Tong Xingbai, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered an address stating that during the International Scout Competition held in the past two months, the performances fully exposed the brutality of imperialism in humiliating weak nations. The true meaning of Scouting is selflessness, not oppression by the powerful. From a negative perspective, one should not have a desire for revenge. From a positive perspective, one should deeply remember to work hard and strive forward.</p>
<p>Guest Speeches</p>
<p>Lai Weiying, Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Command, gave a speech stating that although countries around the world are talking about peace, they are expanding their military preparations. The world is not truly peaceful. One must have considerable military strength to survive. The essence of the army is the people. If the people are good, then the army is good. This responsibility rests on today's Scouts.</p>
<p>Education Director's Speech</p>
<p>Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech stating that the elements of Scouting are discipline, courtesy, martial spirit, and adherence to discipline. If one adheres to discipline, then the law will not be chaotic. If one values courtesy, then people will do their jobs well. If one values martial spirit, then one will not be humiliated. The responsibility of the Scouts is to change customs and habits. After the speech, it was 12:00 noon, and photos were taken and everyone rested. At 2:00 PM, various skills were demonstrated again, and it ended at 5:00 PM. The campfire was originally scheduled for last night, but due to the May 3rd Memorial, it was not appropriate to show mourning, so it was changed to tonight.</p>

<p>Market Sentiment Remains Hesitant and Anxious. Last week's call money showed a slight upward trend. Although the state of affairs was hesitant and there were no special changes, the price of silver still lingered around 740 taels outside of 10 taels. Large clients were seeking supply from various sources. The lowest price on Tuesday was 728.9 taels, which was likely due to the ease in the exchange rate. By Friday, Guangbang Hengxingsheng made a large purchase to offset its short position, suddenly breaking through the 50-tael mark, reaching 53.5 taels. There was also a difference of 24.6 taels. As a result, the market weakened again, settling at 44.7 taels, with a total increase of only 3.9 taels. In short, market sentiment was hesitant and uncertain.

The stagnation of bank transactions was also evident. Chinese gold businesses were scrambling to settle their accounts to offset their previous short positions, and they were using receipts to cover their positions. It is estimated that more than ten taels of profit could be made. According to various firms, they are gradually settling their positions, and they are now almost breaking even. The total amount of receipts in the exchange recently is estimated to be around 46,000 to 47,000. Guangbang, such as Hengxingsheng, Dafeng, Yongda, Xingyong, Tianyu, Yongbingxing, Qianchangxiang, Cuichangyong, and Fuchang, are all long. The Central Bank also seems to be long. Wu has been gradually releasing a lot of gold, but he does not have many assets in hand. Xinxingyuansheng has few long positions, and they are mostly short. The goods are being used for hedging, and the spot houses such as Yingfeng, Hengdafeng, and Heng are also short.

<p>The Cotton Market Fell Sharply and the Situation Was Very Weak. It Is Said That the One-Corner Front of American Cotton Has Been Broken and the Falling Trend Is Still Weaving. At the Same Time, the Yarn Market Fell Sharply and the People's Hearts Were More Weak. The Current Cotton Sales Were Silent, and Each Factory Had No Intention. Therefore, the Market Plate Had a Major Flaw. However, Japanese Merchants Tightened Their Grip Because the Bottom Goods in This City Were Thin. However, the World Cotton Market Is Unstable and Difficult to Support. And a Speculator Turned From Bullish to Short Selling, and the Package Amount Was Very Large.

The Rest Have Not Been Released at the Scale. The Market Situation Is Extremely Quiet.</p>

<p>The Tea Farmers in Wuyi County Pre-Picked and Made the Early Tea Dew Buds, Which Were Slightly Longer, Because the Old Grass Was Exempted From Price Reduction and the Stagnant Sales. Except for Chizhanjian Yanchuan East Road and Other Places That Were Opened for Mining Some Time Ago, Yesterday, North Road Sikou, Sixi, Jinzhu, Longla, Zhangcun, and Other Places Also Hired Workers to Start Enclosing. The Thin and Tender Head of the Tea Body After Production Has Not Been Seen in Decades. If Early and Late Tea Leaves Are Picked Early According to This, the Output Will Inevitably Be A Big Loss. According to the Tea Made Recently, It Is Picked 10 Days Earlier Than in Previous Years. Each Tea Tree Clump Needs to Be Lost by 40%. However, the Tea Number Is Very Happy to See This Improvement Method. It Is Expected That the Finished Boxes Will Be Shipped to Shanghai in the Future, Which Can Invite Foreign Gao Le to Purchase.</p>

It Seems That They Are Eager to Try. Because the Tea Market Needs Money, Qian Zhuang Has Been Transporting Two Batches From Shanghai and Hangzhou for Several Days. The Current Ocean Has More Than 100,000 Silver Roots, Which Is More Smooth Than Before. The Total Number of New and Old Tea Numbers in Tunbu, Shuikou, and Yanghu That Have Decided to Suspend Operations Is Only 67. The Rest Have Already Opened the Scale Early and Are Trying to Open the Scale. There Is Still Some Optimism About the Future of the Tea Market.</p>

<p>Hexi and Yushan in Eastern Jiangxi and Western Guangdong Have Always Been Important Tea-Producing Areas in This Province. In the Most Prosperous Years, There Were 670 Foreign Zhuang Red and Green Tea Numbers. In Recent Years, Due to the Disturbance of Bandits and Foreign Merchants Are Not Very Happy to Purchase Hexi Black Tea, Yushan Green Tea Is Also Rarely Advanced Because of Its Low Quality. Therefore, Those Who Operate Hexi Red and Green Tea Over the Years Are Probably Losing Money. Now That the New Tea in the Area Is About to Be Released, and Early Tea Can Be Picked, However, Mountain Households Are Unwilling to Hire Workers to Pick Tea Because the Price Is Difficult to Increase Due to Unsmooth Sales. Tea Numbers Also Have No Desire to Increase the Burden Because They Have Not Sold the Old Tea Left in Shanghai. Even the Tea Numbers in Hekou, Xiaoyushan, and Zhangcun Street, Where the Tea Market Is Concentrated, Are Still Less Than 10, and the Rest Are Watching. (April 26th)</p>

<p>The Sino-British Negotiations Broke Down</p>
<p>Disagreement on the Fourth Point</p>
<p>It Seems Unlikely That It Will Reopen for A While.</p>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 3rd Reuters has learned that the UK and other relevant countries have put forward the following four points in the negotiations with China on the issue of consular jurisdiction: (1) Cases involving the people of relevant countries that are adjudicated by Chinese courts may be referred to foreign courts of relevant countries; (2) Relevant countries will give up their right of consular jurisdiction, starting with civil cases and slowing down with criminal cases; (3) Chinese special courts will hire foreign consultants to hear foreign cases; (4) The region within fifty miles of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Hankou will still maintain consular jurisdiction for several years. After long-term negotiations, the UK has cancelled the first three points, but insisted on the fourth point. The Chinese government has never agreed to it, so Foreign Minister Wang's negotiations with British Minister Lan broke down, and it seems unlikely that negotiations will reopen for a while.</p>

<p>Commemorating the May 3rd Massacre</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Jingqi Reports</p>
<p>Mrs. Cai's Voice Filled with Tears</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the Jinan Massacre. Public Times Middle School in the Japanese Concession held a memorial meeting at the school playground in the morning. Guests included representatives from the Municipal Party Committee, Zhou Hanmei; representatives from the Municipal Education Bureau, Cen Dezhang; school board members such as Wang Jingqi; and all faculty and students of the school. The meeting began at 10:00 AM, presided over by Chairman Wang Jingqi, with Qin Hegao as the master of ceremonies and Zeng Yaozhang as the recorder. The ceremony was conducted solemnly. First, the chairman reported on the significance of commemorating May 3rd, stating briefly, "When the Jinan Incident occurred three years ago, I was attending a League of Nations meeting in Switzerland. Although there were foreign reports about the case, I was still very doubtful. Only when I received domestic telegrams did I learn the truth of the case, and I was extremely indignant. I originally planned to submit this case to the League of Nations for a fair judgment, but due to other diplomatic issues, I was unable to fulfill my wish, which I deeply regret. I deeply feel that there are three periods in life: past, present, and future. Mr. Gongshi is worthy of our commemoration today because of his great integrity and ability to uphold justice. Our school was founded to commemorate Mr. Gongshi. I hope that students will have good morals and profound knowledge, and serve the country and society in the future to achieve the goal of avenging our humiliation, and not disappoint Mrs. Cai's aspiration to establish schools." Next, Zhou Hanmei, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, gave a speech, stating briefly, "We really did not expect that the Japanese would dare to be so bold as to kill our compatriots in Jinan, massacre our diplomats, and murder martyrs like Cai Gongshi. Even more unexpectedly, the League of Nations showed no reaction to this tragedy. Therefore, we can think of the pity of 'weak countries having no diplomacy' and should determine our future direction of effort. First, we hope to have a unified and strong government to resist the aggression of imperialism and to handle the general construction of China. Second, we hope that the students of Public Times Middle School will take advantage of this promising period of youth to study hard and cultivate themselves quietly in preparation for avenging our humiliation in the future." Then, Cen Dezhang, representative of the Education Bureau, gave a speech, stating briefly, "Today, the whole country commemorates May 3rd, but the most grievous commemoration is here. However, the best way to commemorate Mr. Gongshi is to establish a middle school, because middle school is the foundation of university. If we want to avenge our humiliation, we must first have profound knowledge. Mrs. Cai's founding of Gongshi School, starting with education to achieve the purpose of avenging humiliation, is extremely correct. I hope that all students and faculty will work together to live up to Mrs. Cai's aspirations." Then, guest Xing Yichun and student representatives gave speeches successively. Finally, Mrs. Cai thanked the guests for their guidance and reported on the tragic experience of the Jinan Massacre at that time. Her voice was filled with tears, and the whole audience was extremely sad and indignant, especially many students were in tears. Afterwards, she reported on the process of going to Jinan to investigate the remains of martyr Cai and others, and said that she would still have to go to Jinan after this painful memorial day. It was already after 1:00 PM, so a photo was taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus Jointly Issue a Proclamation Yesterday</p>
<p>The promotion of the new weights and measures system in this city has been set for completion by July 1 of this year. The Social Affairs Bureau has already submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval. As the deadline is very near, it should be actively promoted. Yesterday, the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus jointly issued a proclamation and attached six articles of Chapter 13 of the Criminal Law on the crime of counterfeiting weights and measures to serve as a warning. The original text is as follows: "For the matter of jointly issuing a proclamation, the promotion of the new weights and measures system in this city is scheduled to be completed by July 1 of this year. The Social Affairs Bureau has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval. As the deadline for unification is very short, the weights and measures used in various industries in this city should be actively promoted in accordance with the new system so that they can be unified on schedule. The weighing instruments used in various markets are uneven. Now that the new system is being promoted, it is appropriate to reform them first to benefit the people's livelihood and demonstrate fairness. In addition to ordering all manufacturers and shops in the city to prohibit the manufacture of old instruments and reformulate new instruments, those who violate it will be severely punished.

In addition, if the markets need the aforementioned new instruments, they can directly inquire at the Shanghai Weights and Measures Verification Institute on Xieqiao Manufacturing Bureau Road. This announcement is attached with Chapter 13 of the Criminal Law on the crime of counterfeiting weights and measures. Article 218: Those who intend to manufacture weights and measures that violate the prescribed procedures or change the prescribed procedures of weights and measures for the purpose of exercising them shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year or detention, and may also be fined or converted into a fine of not more than 300 yuan. The attempted crime of this article shall be punished. Article 219: Those who intend to sell weights and measures that violate the prescribed procedures for the purpose of exercising them shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year or detention, and may also be fined or converted into a fine of not more than 300 yuan.

<p>Held a Banquet for Jiang Zuobin the Night Before Last</p>
<p>This time, Envoy Jiang Yuyan to Germany returned to China on official business. The people of the Hubei Shanghai Association held a wash-dust banquet for Envoy Jiang at the Atlantic Restaurant on Fourth Road at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday to express their welcome. At that time, representatives from various sectors of Hubei politics, business, industry, and academia, including Du Xiangqing, Liu Wanqing, Li Jinzhang, Han Yongqing, Song Jiziu, Zhao Chuqiao, Wang Shaocheng, Li Yaoqin, Zhang Jitang, Ren Songru, and others, totaling more than 100 people, arrived. At 6:00 PM, Envoy Jiang took his seat. The Shanghai Hubei Association publicly elected Gao Jianqing to deliver a speech, stating that Envoy Jiang Yuyan is the hope of our Hubei and has benefited the party and the country in his diplomatic work as the envoy to Germany. He is worthy of his mission and is deeply admired by the people. He has also maintained all the public welfare of his hometown and the Shanghai Hubei Association. After more than two years of traveling abroad, we can finally meet today, and the people are very honored. However, the bandits in our province are rampant, and more than 60 counties have been ravaged. The people have lost their homes, and the villages have become ruins. Although the national army has been stationed to suppress them, the roots have not been eradicated. Envoy Jiang is going to Beijing and hopes to represent the public opinion of the people of Hubei and request the authorities to strictly order the officials and soldiers of Hubei Province to carry out a thorough suppression to ensure the safety of the people, etc. Envoy Jiang replied, "I am ashamed that I, a younger brother, have received a banquet from the elders of the township on my return to Shanghai. I remember what the elders expected of me when I went abroad. I can only do my best. It has been more than two years now. Because our country values peace, there are many thorny issues in diplomacy, so there are no results. Since I have this important mission, whether I can do it or not, I will still work hard and strive, or maybe I will achieve my goal in the future. At this moment, I have no certainty. As for the security problem in the province, I am entrusted by the elders. Once I arrive in Beijing, no matter how difficult it is, I will try to submit it to the authorities for relief so that I will not fail the elders' expectations." At that time, the glasses clinked and the toasts were exchanged until 9:15 PM, and everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Inspection of Foreigners' Entry <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Six Ships Arrived in the Past Two Days</p>
<p>All Were Found to Have Passports</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to implement the inspection of foreigners' entry passports from May 1st. The inspection has been quite busy these days. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Procedures: For ships carrying passengers arriving at the first port of Shanghai from overseas (including Hong Kong and Dalian), except for Japanese people who are exempt from inspection due to the Sino-Japanese mutual agreement, the medical officers of the National Quarantine Office first board the ship for inspection, followed by the inspectors of the Passport Inspection Office of the Public Security Bureau, and then the Jianghai Customs inspects prohibited items. No one is allowed to disembark during the inspection, which is very strict. Those who are found to have no passports will be prohibited from landing. If the passport lacks the signature of the Chinese envoy, they must go to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to complete the signature.</p>
<p>Internal Organization: The Passport Inspection Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau is headed by Hong Qi, with Chen Timing as the deputy director. The inspectors are Zhang Feifan, Zheng Zhong, Zhang Xiuhuai, Zhou Yizu, Shao Renlun, Hong Sen, Yao Changzhen, Ou Qiliang, Zhang Desheng, Du Mao, Zhou Chunyu, Li Guangshun, Yuan Ji, Ding He, Zhou Xinyuan, and others, totaling 15 people. All of them are section members of the Public Security Bureau who have been selected by the director for their high academic achievements and graduation from universities or specialized schools, and who are proficient in several languages. They are divided into groups of five and go to inspect the ships as soon as they arrive, regardless of the night. For the convenience of inspection, a temporary office is set up at No. 9 Hankou Road and in the Wusong Ning Shang Fire Brigade. Office hours are from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Situation in the Past Two Days: On the previous day (2nd), the foreign merchant ships that arrived in Shanghai were (1) the Beide Company's Diweisi Fort, which arrived at 11:00 AM and berthed at the Gonghexiang Wharf, (2) the Gleniffer, which sailed from London, England, and arrived at 10:00 AM and berthed at the Zhaoshang North Bund, and (3) the Osaka Company's Nagasaki Maru, which arrived at 3:00 PM and berthed at the Huishan Wharf. Yesterday (3rd), the ships that arrived in Shanghai were (1) the British Company's Cleanthe, which arrived at 10:00 AM and berthed at buoys No. 4 and 5, (2) the Osaka Company's Shengjing Maru, which arrived at 10:00 AM and berthed at the Yangshupu Wharf, and (3) the Java Company's Java, which arrived at 3:00 PM and berthed at the Zhaoshang Middle Bund. After sending personnel to inspect them separately, it was found that none of them had passports. Although a few people lacked the signature of the Chinese envoy due to the tight schedule, the inspectors immediately led them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to complete the signature.</p>

<p>Appropriates Subsidies for Shangbao and Liangxian Counties</p>
<p>Allocated According to the Plan from April</p>
<p>The dispute over the allocation of funds between Shanghai City and Counties has been resolved by the Provincial Government, ordering the Finance Department to liquidate and decide on the subsidies to be given to the county. Because the county government needs funds for relocation, County Magistrate Yan requested the allocation to maintain the county administration. Mayor Zhang approved that the subsidies for Shangbao and Liangxian Counties should be allocated according to the plan from April of this year, as the counties need funds for relocation. An order has been sent to the Finance Bureau to comply with the order and a letter has been sent to the Provincial Government for reference. The Shangbao and Liangxian County Governments have been instructed to collect the funds from the Municipal Finance Bureau separately.</p>

<p>Requests Strict Prohibition of Japanese Fish Sales</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to thoroughly investigate and strictly prohibit Japanese ships from fishing beyond the border and encroaching on our country's territorial waters. The original report stated that Member Jin Chuxiang requested that the import of fish by Japanese ships be stopped and that our country's fishing industry be protected. The Ministry telegraphed an order on February 13 of this year, which was approved by the Ministry of Finance. According to the report from the Zhejiang Customs, Japanese fishing boats do not declare the import of fish. The original report and order were forwarded for your information. Later, on March 3, Jin Chuxiang continued to state that Japanese ships fishing beyond the sea have been reported in newspapers more than once. Chuxiang was born in a fishing village and is familiar with the fishing industry. Because he recognized the failure of the fishing industry in recent years and the encroachment on maritime rights by imperialists, he shouted loudly and requested the Chamber of Commerce to forward the report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for verification and handling in order to save the fishing industry and fight for national rights. Unexpectedly, the authorities only relied on the Zhejiang Customs to recognize that Japanese fishing boats do not declare the import of fish, and dismissed the report as not matching the facts reported by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and did not thoroughly investigate whether there were any Japanese fishing boats entering other ports. Chuxiang believed that it was a perfunctory matter, because the Japanese are cunning and often collude with Chinese traitors to deceive and conceal the import of fish. Therefore, tax declarations are often concealed. Recently, the Daiseimaru, Takakumo Maru, and Hakuyo Maru, three fishing boats managed by the Japanese merchant Rin-yu Company, were transported to Xiaodongmen in Shanghai to sell Chinese fish in large quantities. The facts are all there. Please send personnel to thoroughly investigate and clarify to dispel doubts and save fish merchants. It was immediately ordered that personnel be dispatched to investigate and found that the import of fish by the Japanese has been going on for a long time. However, the products imported have always been Qingchuan salmon and other products, as well as yellow croaker, shark, and beltfish. According to the report, these types of fish are produced in the seas of Jiangzhe under the jurisdiction of Sheshan Langgang Reef. Foreigners are now importing this type of fish, which is abnormal. However, there is no basis to know whether the Japanese are fishing within our country's maritime rights or outside the border. It is only known that they are packed and transported to China and docked in the Yangshupu area, where they evade taxes and sell them to vendors. Merchants profit from their low prices and compete to purchase them. Half of them are sold to small vegetable market stalls and half are sold to fresh fish shops. Later, this case was reported in the newspapers, and all sectors opposed it strongly. Therefore, the Japanese ships slightly reduced their activities, and imports have gradually decreased recently. It was also stated that there are companies such as the Da Zhonghua Company that organize their own rounds for procurement, and there are also companies with complete Chinese capital that hire Japanese people to rent Japanese ships. However, the Japanese collude with traitors to seek profits, and it is difficult to distinguish the truth in this. Recently, the fishery improvement association's publicity has called for fishery administration agencies to actively prevent or possibly save the situation. Based on this, the damage caused by Japanese ships fishing beyond the border and encroaching on our country's territorial waters and the methods of prevention have been detailed in the telegram of the Association last November, and we have been granted an investigation. According to the investigation, Japanese fish are sold in this city, and there are Japanese colluding with traitors. Although all sectors and fishery groups oppose it, it is not effective unless the competent authorities strictly prohibit it. It is reasonable to telegraph the Ministry for inspection and approval to thoroughly investigate and strictly prohibit it without any leniency to maintain the fishery for public convenience.</p>

<p>Telegraphically Request to Stop Japanese Fishing Vessels from Entering</p>
<p>The fishery groups in Jiangsu and Zhejiang telegraphed the central government, Nanjing, and distributed them to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministries of Industry, Finance, and Foreign Affairs. Japanese fishing vessels occupying fishing grounds have long been prohibited. The extension period for the Japanese fishing vessels has expired, and we have repeatedly requested a delay. A mistake, then another, is of utmost importance to the national system, and the people's grievances are boiling. If the government allows Japanese fishing vessels to enter and sell again, then millions of fishermen along the coast will have difficulty surviving. The situation is urgent, and there are inciting words that may lead to a tragedy. The masses are panicked and cannot be stopped. We earnestly request that the Shanghai Customs Police be ordered to immediately prohibit Japanese fishing vessels from entering to appease the people's hearts. The urgent telegram is unbearable, waiting for orders.

<h3 id="e67">Various Industries Tax Rules Association <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Continues to Submit Opinions on Business Tax</p>
<p>The tax rules research committee of the various industries' trade associations in Shanghai previously forwarded the opinions of the dried longan industry and the native cloth industry on the business tax rate in Shanghai to the Municipal Government for adoption. Recently, the association has received opinions from various industries' trade associations.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>May 4th, 20th year of the Republic of China (Fourth Sheet of the Shen Bao) Monday (40)</p>
<p>After further research, the association believes that they should be revised. Yesterday, it submitted the revised text to the Municipal Government for further action. The opinions submitted by the association are recorded as follows: 1. The purpose of the taxi industry is to serve the society and facilitate transportation, and foreign merchants and colleagues are mixed in it. The rate of taxation should be specially reduced and calculated at one-thousandth of the capital to facilitate promotion. 2. The Chinese and Western furniture industry's business is all furniture supplies, and raw materials such as ziji, mahogany, teak, liuan, and masuli, and accessories such as paoli paint, glass, hinges, and hardware, etc., are directly and indirectly subject to business tax. The burden is already excessive and should be reviewed and reduced to two-thousandths of the business tax of the industry. 3. The restaurant industry and the teahouse industry's business is all to supply food, which is the same nature as the cake industry and the noodle industry. The business tax rate in this city is two-thousandths for the cake industry and the qushi industry, while it is five-thousandths for the restaurant industry and the teahouse industry. The difference in weight is obvious and should be reduced to two-thousandths to show equality. 4. The silver cabinet industry's business contains manufacturing properties. Zhejiang Province's business tax has been taxed according to the capital. This city cannot be unique and should be taxed according to the capital as in Zhejiang Province. 5. The department store industry's best-selling items are socks, followed by cotton textiles, etc. Cosmetics and miscellaneous goods account for only one-tenth or two-tenths of the total amount. Although the store names are named after the company sock factory, the actual business is the sales agency of various woven products. The recent draft of the business tax rate table in this city taxes five-thousandths, while the revised business tax collection regulations of the Ministry of Finance for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces stipulate that if a store has several businesses with different tax rates, the tax amount should be calculated based on the main part of its business. Then, the business tax of the industry should not exceed two-thousandths to avoid inequality and comply with the provisions of the regulations. 6. The blasting industry's business tax is proposed to be ten-thousandths in the draft business tax in this city, while the tax rates set by Hunan and Anhui provinces are both two-thousandths. It should be reduced in accordance with the precedent to show support for manual labor. 7. The business tax rate for the flower and tree industry and the watch industry in this city's draft business tax is ten-thousandths. In terms of their nature, one is an agricultural product that is directly related to the livelihood of farmers, and the other is a tool for timing, which is especially necessary for life at this time of complex social life. They should be reduced to two-thousandths to comply with the provisions of the outline.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Each Industry Requests Reduction in Business Tax <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association yesterday submitted a petition stating that the Finance Bureau's request to classify ginseng and bird's nest as common medicines and tax them at a rate of 0.2% was unreasonable. The petition outlined reasons for requesting a re-evaluation, clarifying that these items are not luxury goods, expressing their difficulties, and requesting a reduction in the business tax rate to alleviate the merchants' hardship and prevent business failures.</p>
<p>The association stated that they had read in newspapers that after the tax system was reformed, business tax was levied to compensate for the abolition of "likin" (internal transit tax). The business tax rates were based on the previous income from "likin". The association argued that Shanghai's "likin" revenue was never as substantial as that of other provinces. The current tax rates exceeded the national guidelines, especially for ginseng and bird's nest, which was a fundamental error. The association had submitted two petitions requesting a reduction in the business tax rate, but they were not approved. They felt compelled to list the uses of ginseng and bird's nest, emphasizing that they are life-saving medicines and more important than other medicines. To classify them as luxury goods was a mistake.</p>
<p>The petition further stated that the "Compendium of Materia Medica" details the extensive use of ginseng and bird's nest in various medicinal preparations. They are often used to revive patients at death's door. Wealthy patients may not be affected by the tax, but for the poor, the tax increases the price, potentially leading to their demise. The tax rate for ginseng and bird's nest was higher than other medicines, seemingly focusing only on the wealthy, classifying them as luxury goods and not treating them the same as other medicines. The association implored the authorities to approve the classification of ginseng and bird's nest as medicines, taxed at 0.2%. This would not only alleviate the burden on the industry but also benefit the poor.</p>
<p>The Tea and Food Industry</p>
<p>The draft tax rate proposed for the city listed the tea and food industry at 0.5%. Merchants felt this was unbearable. Besides sending a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, they sent representatives Yang Qixian, Zhu Yongqing, Huang Zhenyu, Chen Hanqing, and others to the Municipal Government and the Finance Bureau to plead their case. Mayor Zhang, Section Chief Shen, and Bureau Chief Cai's representative, Section Chief Ma, received the representatives. The representatives stated the reasons for requesting a lower tax rate as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Tea and food are not luxury goods but common food items for the general public, like salt and rice.</p>
<p>(2) The raw materials for the tea and food industry are similar to those of the pastry and noodle industries, which are taxed at 0.2%. The tea and food industry should have the same tax rate.</p>
<p>(3) The "Nanhua" (Southern Goods) industry, which also sells tea, food, ginseng, bird's nest, and seafood, has a lower tax rate than the tea and food industry.</p>
<p>(4) Besides special taxes, unified taxes, and factory taxes, all raw materials for tea and food are taxed. Imposing a second business tax at such a high rate is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Section Chiefs Shen and Ma stated that the tax rate was only a draft proposal. Because tea and food were considered excessively taxed, they would convey the representatives' opinions to the Mayor and Bureau Chief for consideration and reduction. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>The Eyeglasses Industry</p>
<p>The draft regulations and tax rate schedule for the city's business tax have been proposed by the Business Tax Preparation Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau. Because the business tax was a new initiative, they sought opinions from various trade associations through newspaper announcements. The Eyeglasses Trade Association felt that the proposed tax rate of 1% for the eyeglasses industry, the same as luxury goods, was excessive. The association sent Zhuang Honggao, Zhang Shide, and Wang Shuquan as representatives to present their opinions to the office in person and submitted a written petition to reduce the tax rate. The original text is transcribed below:</p>
<p>"Petition to supplement the explanation of the function of eyeglasses for consideration, requesting a reduction in the tax rate to encourage the industry and alleviate merchants' hardship. We have read the First Announcement of your office and learned that the draft regulations and tax rate schedule for the city's business tax have been proposed by your office. Because this is a new initiative, you are seeking opinions from various trade associations. We requested your office to send us the full draft for review. We found that the proposed tax rate for the eyeglasses industry was 1%, which shocked us. Eyeglasses are to the eyes as medicine is to the sick; they are a necessity. The proposed tax rate is the same as that for antiques and gold and silver jewelry. This clearly views eyeglasses as luxury goods and fails to understand their function. Therefore, we venture to briefly explain their effectiveness for your office's consideration.</p>
<p>The form of eyeglasses may vary, but they are mainly used for presbyopia, nearsightedness, and astigmatism. Elderly people suffer from failing eyesight, and presbyopic lenses allow them to see clearly. Nearsighted people cannot see distant objects, but nearsighted lenses allow them to see everything clearly. Young people are often studious, and prolonged viewing can damage their blood. Eyestrain can easily occur, and astigmatic lenses not only benefit hygiene but also provide protection. Colored lenses can block out electric light and sunlight and are suitable for treating eye diseases.</p>
<p>Therefore, eyeglasses are closely related to people's well-being. The eyes are the master of the body. The enjoyment of life depends on the eyes. Ordinary people can see more clearly with eyeglasses, and those with eye diseases are essentially disabled without them. The principles of chemistry and optics cannot function without eyeglasses. The development of industry and science depend on the eyes. Without eyeglasses to protect eyesight, one cannot fully understand the principles.</p>
<p>European and American countries recognize the function of eyeglasses and classify them as medicines. The National Government is implementing business tax to compensate for the loss of "likin" revenue. Shanghai has no "likin" and therefore no loss. Even if regulations are followed, merchants' hardship should be considered, and tax rates should be reduced. The eyeglasses industry should be encouraged and not treated as a luxury.</p>
<p>We hope that your office will adhere to the National Government's principle of creating taxes and adopting the current regulations of Europe and America. We request that the tax rate for eyeglasses be revised to be the same as the 0.2% tax rate for medicines, to benefit the country and its people and avoid the criticism of imposing excessive taxes on merchants. In addition to sending Zhuang Honggao, Zhang Shide, and Wang Shuquan as representatives to present our opinions to your office, we have prepared this document explaining that the function of eyeglasses is different from that of luxury goods and requesting a reduction in the tax rate to encourage the industry. We respectfully submit this petition to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau Business Tax Preparation Office for review and implementation."</p>

<p>Telegram and Letter from the Support Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai community's Xin Case Support Association yesterday submitted petitions to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting serious negotiations. They also sent a letter to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, requesting their support. The texts of the petitions and letter are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters:</p>
<p>(1) Petition regarding the unprovoked shooting of compatriot Xin Haishan by French police, causing outrage in all sectors of society. Request for serious negotiations with the French Consul.</p>
<p>On April 7, French police officer No. 158 of the French Concession police station shot and injured pedestrian Xin Haishan, an employee of Changhe Company. Various organizations have requested negotiations without any results. Xin is in critical condition at Renji Hospital, and his family is in distress. Relatives have been trying to seek help from all sides. If even rabbits and foxes sympathize with each other in death, how can humans not be moved? On April 28, representatives from all sectors of society gathered and unanimously resolved to support Xin. A committee was formed to handle the matter. In addition to the association sending a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting negotiations, all matters regarding the identification of the perpetrator, compensation, and guarantees are submitted in writing for your approval. We respectfully request that you forward this to the French Consul in Shanghai for serious negotiations, to ensure that they are fulfilled one by one to appease the public.</p>
<p>(2) Letter to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association:</p>
<p>We are writing to inform you that French police officer No. 158 of the French Concession police station shot Xin Haishan, seriously injuring his neck. This incident occurred more than twenty days ago, and despite requests for negotiations from various organizations, the other party has ignored them. Xin is being treated at Renji Hospital and is in critical condition. His family is in great distress. We respectfully request that you engage in serious negotiations with the authorities to achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrator, providing compensation, and ensuring guarantees. We believe that your association, as the highest authority for citizens in the French Concession, will be able to uphold justice and speak out for what is right. In addition to this association petitioning the Municipal Government to negotiate with the French Consul, we are also sending this letter to you for your information and response.</p>

<p>Stated that he was acting under orders</p>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, there have been widespread discussions regarding the opposition from the Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Beiping to the Directorate General of Posts' ordering of stamps from foreign companies. The agency's reporter visited Lin Shi, the former Director General of Posts, to inquire about the matter. Lin Shi, though unwell, received the reporter and discussed the issue.</p>
<p>Reporter: It is said that the contract between the Ministry of Communications and the foreign company for ordering stamps was advocated by you last year when you served concurrently as Director of the Postal Department. Is this true?</p>
<p>Lin Shi appeared surprised and shook his head, stating that there were many misunderstandings regarding this matter. He clarified that he did not advocate this while concurrently serving as Director of the Postal Department. Furthermore, his concurrent service as Director of the Postal Department was not last year, as he had relinquished the position in the previous year.</p>
<p>Reporter: Then why did the Post Office contract with a foreign company? What was the process?</p>
<p>Lin Shi: When I was Director General of Posts, I was acting under orders regarding the contract with a foreign company. The accusations against me are not true. I have already made a statement on this matter. However, the process is quite lengthy. Since the autumn of the 18th year, I have suffered from dysentery and have been ill for over a year. Recently, I have been losing blood, making it very difficult to speak. I apologize that I cannot provide a detailed answer at this time and will do so after I have recovered.</p>
<p>The reporter, seeing that Lin Shi was very weak, did not want to cause further strain and excused himself.</p>

<p>Requesting Support from All Sectors</p>
<p>The families of the victims of the Dachang Steamer disaster established the Dachang Steamer Victims' Families Association on May 3. The association issued an appeal to all sectors of society:</p>
<p>"The Dahua Company's Dachang Steamer departed from Dapukaishi, Haizhou, on April 13 at 3:15 AM, heading for Shanghai. At 8:30 PM the next day, outside the Wusongkou, it encountered the Ping'an Company's Dahua Steamer. The Dachang Steamer sounded its horn to warn the other ship, as per usual procedure. However, the captain and first and second mates of the Dahua Steamer were not on duty at the time, and only the helmsman was present (as determined after the fact). Therefore, the Dahua Steamer did not respond to the Dachang Steamer's horn. After sounding the horn again, the Dahua Steamer still did not respond and rammed the Dahua Steamer broadside, penetrating the engine room. The Dachang Steamer was struck on its left side, where the red light was hung. The Dahua Steamer did not turn its bow to the right but rammed the red light side of the other ship's broadside. Anyone familiar with navigation knows that this was a driving error. The Dachang Steamer sustained a massive breach, and seawater immediately flooded in.</p>
<p>After causing the accident, the Dahua Steamer not only did not help but sped away. The Dachang Steamer urgently sounded its distress horn and fired distress flares. The crew and passengers shouted for help. The surrounding sea area and the Wusong Fort were all aware of the situation. The Dahua Steamer then realized that even if it tried to escape, it could not hide from observers. It returned, but about five to six minutes had elapsed since the initial accident. The Dahua Steamer still did not help but stood by and watched. It circled the Dachang Steamer three times. All who saw it were filled with hatred, and heaven and earth could not tolerate it. Fortunately, the Taigu Company's Hanyang Steamer heard the distress calls and came to help at around 9:40 PM. When the Dahua Steamer saw a third party arrive, it grudgingly provided assistance, but it had spent over an hour watching from the sidelines. Five minutes after it began to help, the Dachang Steamer sank entirely, drowning seven crew members and dozens of passengers.</p>
<p>The Dahua Steamer's negligence caused the accident, and its deliberate inaction afterward contributed to the tragedy. According to civil and criminal law, the Dahua Steamer is fully responsible. The families of the dozens of victims on the Dachang Steamer have lost their support and become orphans. We have been negotiating with the Ping'an Company regarding compensation and the aftermath, but there have been no results. We have entrusted lawyers Zhang Zhirang and Jiang Qishi to protect our rights according to law. We ask all sectors of society and all public organizations to uphold justice and provide support to comfort the deceased and reassure the helpless."</p>
<h3 id="e74">Meeting Record of the Anhui Rice Merchants Association <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Anhui Rice Merchants Association of this port held a meeting of the Standing Committee yesterday afternoon. Attending were Lin Chunyu, Yan Zhishan, and Executive Committee members Wang Yuelou and Lin Songru, along with ten others. Lin Chunyu was elected chairman and proposed the following items:</p>
<p>(1) Transportation companies assign personnel to take care of passengers and goods transported from Beijing to Shanghai. This is their due duty, and there should be no charge for this. Due to the large number of personnel at the upper station, a fee of one jiao (ten cents) per ton was requested. This was not done for many years, but now the fee has suddenly increased by five fen (five cents) per ton. The committee unanimously rejected this increase.</p>
<p>(2) It was previously agreed with the Ren Grain Association that payments for hulled rice should be made within ten days. Some are arbitrarily delaying payments, causing losses to the customers. This is not acceptable and a solution must be found.</p>
<p>(3) Recently, letters have been received from various inland groups saying that this year's wheat harvest is very good, unprecedented in recent years. With the harvest approaching and foreign wheat flooding the country, there is concern that the market will weaken if measures are not taken to remove mud and deduct pounds. The committee resolved to send letters to various groups urging them to rectify the situation.</p>

<p>The Chinese Western Medicine Association held its 33rd Standing Committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Qian Longzhang. The following items were discussed:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Health has been organized and established. Should the association re-register? It was resolved to first apply to the Municipal Citizen Training Committee for approval and then register.</p>
<p>(2) Xiang Lianqiu proposed that the association should express its opinion on the higher medical examination held by the Examination Yuan in July this year. It was resolved to re-submit a statement to the Ministry of Internal Affairs opposing the exam, based on the resolution of the previous session. Ye Jubo was asked to draft the statement.</p>
<p>(3) The Public Concession registration. It was resolved to notify all members that those who have not submitted their registration forms should do so within three days to facilitate forwarding for review and avoid investigation.</p>
<p>(4) Zhong Dingshen, Xu Yiting, Yun Huanan, Lü Jiangyue, Pan Shaochun, and Luo Keshi applied for membership. It was resolved to approve the membership of Zhong Dingshen, Xu Yiting, Yun Huanan, and Lü Jiangyue. The application of Pan Shaochun and Luo Keshi will be reviewed after further investigation. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Telegram Requesting Relief for the Disaster in Chaoyang, Rehe</p>
<p>The China Jishan Society recently received a letter from Yang Mingsheng, the president of the Rehe Fengji Jiang Four-Province Charity United Association: "The drought and flood disasters in Chaoyang, Rehe, are severe. The grass roots and tree bark have been completely stripped. People are automatically leaving for the three northeastern provinces to reclaim land. They are walking along the way, suffering from hunger and struggling to walk. Four thousand have gathered in Jinzhou and Suihua, Liaoning Province. Fortunately, General Zhu Ziqiao has witnessed the suffering and requested free transportation to Jilin and Jiangxi provinces. More are following. This proves the severity of the disaster in Chaoyang. Many children and elderly people cannot travel far and many victims have repeatedly sent representatives to beg for relief. They are waiting to be fed. We have discussed with Zhu Ziqiao and selected areas with severe disasters to set up four porridge kitchens. Each kitchen is estimated to cost 5,000 yuan, totaling 20,000 yuan. Zhu Ziqiao has asked major charities in Tianjin to donate 10,000 yuan. The remaining 10,000 yuan has not been secured. We request your association to donate generously so that the porridge kitchens can be established as soon as possible. General Zhu Ziqiao will provide more details in person. The association is currently short of funds and unable to refuse. The benevolent comrades at home and abroad can work together to save them."</p>

<p>Rectification of the Songhu Branch Road</p>
<p>Request to Restore the Number of Train Services</p>
<p>The Wusong Eighth District Party Headquarters submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting that it be forwarded to the National Government to order the Ministry of Railways to quickly rectify the Songhu Branch Road. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Petition regarding the request for rectification. The Songhu Railway is the only major transportation route between Wusong and Shanghai. Since the introduction of steam trains, trains have often been delayed or cancelled. Changes in schedules and reduced services have caused crowding and complaints. Not only have passengers suffered, but all parties have suffered greatly. If this is not quickly rectified, the impact will be unimaginable. Social progress requires increased transportation. Train services should be increased based on actual needs and should not be arbitrarily reduced. This is the general principle. There were public buses between Shanghai and Jiangwan, but now the number of services has been increased. There are no public buses between Shanghai and Wusong, and train services have been reduced. This is unreasonable. The representatives of the district unanimously resolved to request the central government to order the Ministry of Railways to quickly rectify the Songwan Railway and restore the original number of services. We respectfully submit this petition for your review and referral."</p>

<p>Kang-Tibetan Walking Tour</p>
<p>Certificates and Passports All Obtained</p>
<p>Regarding reports in various newspapers the day before yesterday about the organization of the Kang-Tibetan Walking Tour, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired at the tour's office whether the organization was the same as the one formed in August of last year. They happened to meet Mr. Wang Jin-yuan, the tour's secretary, who said, "Our group was indeed organized in August of last year. Its purpose is to study the history, geography, people's customs, cultural development, resources, transportation, trade, and current situation of the border between Tibet and India, and to awaken them to the British encroachment on the frontier. We aim to conduct a detailed investigation and present it to the nation to reveal the truth of British aggression on the borders and to help open up the Tibetan source in the future. We could have set off earlier, but due to various reasons such as recruiting talent, contacting for passports, raising funds, etc., we petitioned in Beijing in November of last year. We have now received encouragement and instructions from Chairman Chiang, Vice Commander Zhang, and celebrities from all walks of life. At the same time, we have received a certificate from the Central Party Department and a passport from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. We have also made arrangements with Sichuan and Xikang along the way for careful protection. I returned to Shanghai on the 19th of this month to prepare for departure, while Zhang Zhi and others stayed in Beijing to participate in the celebration of the National Assembly and take on propaganda tasks. Once they are finished, they will also return to Shanghai and decide to depart from Shanghai."</p>

<p>Inscriptions from Celebrities and Travel Certificates Returned</p>
<p>Wei Juezhong, the cyclist who travels the world alone, stayed at 932 Zhenru Railway Station Road a month ago, immersing himself in writing. On March 10th, his leather suitcase was stolen. He reported the theft to the Zhenru Public Security Bureau, and it was recorded in various newspapers. Unexpectedly, at around 9 a.m. the day before yesterday, Mr. Wei received a large envelope from the Zhenru Post Office without postage. Upon opening it, he found the celebrity inscriptions and travel certificates that had been stolen the previous month. At the bottom was written "Sent from this city." On the front left end of the envelope, there were four characters written in pen: "Conscience Discovered." On the back lower end, there were two lines of small writing in pen: "Please forgive me, I didn't have money to put on stamps." And "You must thank me in the newspaper when you receive this, if it wasn't for my means, you probably wouldn't have this success." The handwriting was neat and undoubtedly written by the ethical thief himself. Mr. Wei was overjoyed upon receiving it and thanked endlessly. According to Mr. Wei, in addition to these two important items, there were also landscape photo negatives and manuscripts in the stolen suitcase. If the ethical thief discovers his conscience again and returns them one by one, he will express his gratitude in Shanghai newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="e85">University Student Disappears <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Wife and Sister in Dispute</p>
<p>Sister Accused of Occupying Property</p>
<p>Wife's Identity Questioned</p>
<p>Ni Guangxun, a student at Chizhi University, suddenly left home last winter and his whereabouts are unknown. Later, it was heard that Ni had gone to Peiping alone to study at Yenching University, but his family has not received any communication from Ni since his disappearance, so it is difficult to determine whether he is studying in Peiping. Recently, Fan Abao, who claims to be Ni's wife, filed a complaint with the Special District Local Court, accusing Ni's sister, Zeng Ni Guangchen (the sixth sister), of occupying Guangxun's 20,000 yuan family property. The Special Court had once summoned them for questioning, but because the plaintiff had not paid the litigation fees, the judge ordered her to pay the fees before summoning witnesses for further interrogation. Now, the defendant, Zeng Ni Guangchen, hired two lawyers, Zhang Deqin and Shen Yuesheng, to submit a response stating that Ni Guangxun is only 24 years old and was studying at Chizhi University. Whether he secretly went to Peiping to study is difficult to determine. However, according to the defendant and Ni's relatives, before Guangxun left, they never heard of him marrying or participating in a wedding on any date. Therefore, the plaintiff's identity is unclear and suspicious, and she should not expect to inherit any of Guangxun's property. The reason why the plaintiff has this improper idea to take a chance is that the defendant's late father did hire Fan Abao as a servant when he was alive. Perhaps Guangxun had an improper relationship with the plaintiff at that time, and it was only an act of indecency. This should only be regarded as Guangxun's personal emotional entanglement, which should be negotiated with Guangxun himself. The defendant or relatives cannot be forced to recognize her as Guangxun's formal wife and demand that the defendant inherit Guangxun's property. The meaning is very clear. Therefore, if the plaintiff wants to claim property rights, she must first determine her identity. Now, the plaintiff is arbitrarily making trouble without reason, which is a fundamental mistake and cannot be tolerated in law or reason. The plaintiff's accusation of occupying family property and refusing to hand it over is even more unreasonable and absurd. The defendant's late father passed away in the 18th year of the Republic of China. At that time, Guangxun was already 22 years old and an adult, not a young child without knowledge. When the father was alive, he worked in the customs office and his monthly income was only enough for household expenses. He did not engage in other side businesses to become wealthy. Perhaps there were slight savings, but the expenses for Guangxun's years of schooling and the other two brothers' schooling were also used up over time. Moreover, the defendant is Guangxun's sister. Is Guangxun the only one who has the right to inherit the father's estate? Can't the defendant and the other two brothers intervene? According to the law, they should inherit and share. Now, the plaintiff does not understand the truth and falsely claims that Guangxun's property is stored with the defendant, which is completely slanderous and fabricated in the hope of taking a chance. It should be known that Guangxun is already an adult, not like a child who must have his property kept by others. Who would willingly give up his ownership and not manage it himself, but have to rely on others? Furthermore, the plaintiff's statement that Guangxun and she have always had a harmonious relationship is even more ridiculous and absurd. If Guangxun and she were extremely in love, why did he leave without saying a word, regardless of everything? It can be predicted that Guangxun's situation at the time must have been unpleasant and with unspeakable pain, so he took this last resort. This is not something the defendant could have imagined. In short, the plaintiff's statements are completely wishful thinking and fabricated out of thin air. Since there is no conclusive evidence, how can she make demands on the defendant to inherit Guangxun's property? Based on the above facts, it is clear that the plaintiff's lawsuit has no reason and is deliberately harassing. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting dismissal and judgment to bear the litigation costs. However, Fan Abao, during the previous court hearing, mentioned Ni Wenming, Guangxun's uncle, as a witness to prove that she was Ni Guangxun's wife. Therefore, how Fan and Ni combined will be determined when Ni's uncle is summoned for a subsequent hearing, which may prove it.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Son of Famous Doctor <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Divorces Due to Impotence</p>
<p>Alimony and Dowry Fees</p>
<p>Must Compensate 5,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Tao Yiqing, the eldest son of the late famous doctor Tao Yinkang of this city, was recently sued in the local court by his wife, Tao Cai Wenqing, for abuse and abandonment, and accused Tao of suffering from impotence, demanding a divorce and claiming compensation of 8,000 yuan for consolation money and 1,977 yuan for dowry fees. After multiple summons, the case was not concluded. The day before yesterday, a continuation hearing was held in the afternoon by Judge Chen Bingxin in the Sixth Court. Both parties attended with their lawyers. Tao Yiqing first stated that her (referring to the plaintiff) accusation that I have impotence is false. The money needed for my marriage with her was borrowed from relatives and friends. Soon after, my late father, Yinkang, passed away, which led to debt collectors constantly knocking on the door. Therefore, the environment was extremely bad, and I suffered a great shock mentally. Unfortunately, after this divorce lawsuit occurred, my reputation and business suffered a significant impact, so I do not want a divorce. The court said, "She doesn't want to be with you. What's the point of forcing her to live with you?" (Answer) "If she insists on leaving, I have no choice. However, I am really unable to bear the alimony. As for the dowry, I will return it as listed on her list, and compensate for the missing items with money." Next, Tao Cai Wenqing stated that what the defendant said was all lies. Whether he has a hidden illness is proven by the Chinese Red Cross Hospital's certificate. He is truly heartless, delaying my life and cutting off my livelihood. If I continue to live with him, my lifelong happiness will be exploited by him. Before I married, I relied on my parents. After marriage, I should be protected by my husband. Moreover, my father and brothers are poor. The cost of buying various dowry items for over 1,000 yuan when I got married was not easy. If I am penniless after the divorce, how will I live? Therefore, the pain I have suffered and my future life require no less than 8,000 yuan. The judge attempted to reconcile the situation in court, but because the defendant firmly refused, the reconciliation failed. The judge then invited Prosecutor Wang to express his opinion, stating that the plaintiff's request for divorce is justified because the defendant's hidden illness has been confirmed by the hospital. Please make a judgment in accordance with the law. Finally, after mutual arguments by the two lawyers, the judge concluded and adjourned the court to await the verdict. The verdict has been recorded as follows: The marriage between the plaintiff (Tao Cai Wenqing) and the defendant (Tao Yiqing) should be dissolved. The defendant should pay the plaintiff 5,500 yuan for alimony and dowry clothing. The plaintiff's other claims are dismissed. The litigation costs are borne by the defendant.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Two Unemployed Attempt Suicide <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, Both Were Rescued</p>
<p>Xie Zhouzhou, a young man wearing Western clothing, threw himself into the river at the Tongxing Wharf on Wusong Wai Ma Road at 9:50 p.m. the night before last, attempting suicide. Constable Hou Desheng from the First Precinct of the Seventh District Public Security Bureau spotted him and immediately stepped forward to rescue him. With the help of boatmen, he was rescued and brought back to the precinct. After questioning by Director Zhang, he identified himself as Xie Zhouzhou, 20 years old, from Wuxi, Jiangsu. He used to work for a Westerner, but had been unemployed for over a year since the Westerner returned to his country in February of last year. With no means of making a living, his finances deteriorated day by day. The bleak future left him with no foothold, and he had no choice but to take a train from Shanghai to Wusong and throw himself into the river. He requested resettlement after being rescued. Director Zhang, after taking his statement, noted that his name, Zhouzhou, was unfamiliar. After checking the dictionary, it roughly meant resentment for his own inability. When asked about the meaning, he replied that the name had been used for a long time and had no other meaning. After the statement, he ordered the police to send him to the judicial section for disposition yesterday.</p>
<p>Huang Fuquan, a patrol officer from the Wusong Seventh District Public Security Bureau, was patrolling the Paotaiwan area at around 2 p.m. the day before yesterday when he suddenly saw a man pacing back and forth on the beach, sighing with a miserable expression. After looking around, he made a gesture of throwing himself into the sea. Seeing this, the patrol officer rushed forward and grabbed the man's clothes, preventing him from falling into the water. He was then taken back to the district office. After questioning by District Chief Zhao Ze Zhou, the man identified himself as Huang Fuquan, 28 years old, living in Bailu Lane, Broadway Road, Shanghai. He used to work on a ship, but recently became unemployed and could not maintain his livelihood. He thought it would be better to die than to suffer in this world, so he took a car to Songjiang, hoping to commit suicide by throwing himself into the sea. While giving his statement, he was weeping, which moved those who heard it. After much persuasion, the police were sent to Shanghai to notify his family. That night, his father, Huang Tulin, came to Songjiang and presented himself to the Seventh District to take him home.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Beside the Body <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>A Love Letter</p>
<p>Not Dead for Love</p>
<p>Cause of Suicide Unknown</p>
<p>At around 8 a.m. yesterday morning, a young man's body suddenly floated up on the riverbank outside Suzhou Creek Park. He was wearing a tweed hunting jacket, black trousers, black leather shoes, and leather leggings. He had a white ring on his finger, with indistinguishable gold and silver, engraved with the blue Western letters "CK." He appeared to be in his early twenties. A Chinese constable, number 68, from the Customs Water Police Station discovered it and fished the body back to the police station. A love letter was found on the body, along with several pawn tickets from the Liyu Guest House at 2 Alley, Fuyu Lane, telephone number 61315, and a delivery order from various companies for a black and gray tweed hunting jacket costing 11.50 yuan. The police station then transferred the body and belongings to the Nanshi Lifesaving Bureau's patrol boat for collection, pending identification. The love letter was written in pencil on a Chinese-style letterhead and addressed to a certain lane, number 18, North Sichuan Road. The original text, which was read with deep affection and reluctance to part, indicated that the deceased did not commit suicide for love. The following is a copy:</p>
<p>"My dearest ○○ sister,</p>
<p>Everything you said in Beijing the day before yesterday, I naturally understand. I originally wanted to write to you, but there was nothing going on at home. Please forgive me, ○ sister. I am going to Nanjing on May 3rd. I will wait for you at the Xinguang Theater at 6:30 p.m. the day after tomorrow. Please don't miss the appointment. Oh sister, I am about to leave you, but you don't have to be sad. I believe in you and love you. But I hope you will take care of everything after I leave and not always think of me. Communicate with me often. You once said you wanted to send a small photo. I am very grateful to you. I am really embarrassed and dare not accept your kindness. I don't know how to repay your affection, ○ sister. After arriving in Nanjing, I will report everything to you. I will write to you then. Now there are other things and I can't write more.

<h3 id="e89">Municipal Utilities Bureau Urges <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Improvement of Voltage on Dong Yokohama Road</p>
<p>In the past few months, the voltage in the Dong Yokohama Road area of ​​Zhabei has been too low and unstable, causing the electric lights to flicker like candles in the wind, which has caused great suffering to residents. The Municipal Utilities Bureau, upon receiving the report, sent personnel to use an automatic voltage recording meter to obtain a 24-hour voltage record of the area. The highest voltage was 214 volts, and the time was from 1:00 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. The lowest voltage was 154 volts, and the time was from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. The fluctuations in between were very drastic, with drops of 100 volts or more in an instant. The fluctuations were slight only from 12:00 noon to 1:00 p.m. The reason was that there were many power users in the vicinity, which had such a significant impact. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was often asked to replace the main line on the road with a thicker one or reconnect it to the Baoshan Road main line. If the voltage was still too low and unstable, or the Baoshan Road main line could not bear the load, a transformer substation would be set up near Dong Yokohama Road to supply power. It is now known that the company has immediately added a set of feeder lines, and the voltage is slightly higher than before, but still not very stable. It is planning to add a transformer near the Continental Lane on Dong Yokohama Road, which can also feed power to Dingxing Lane on North Sichuan Road and Yingui Road, etc. Because the 6,600-volt high-voltage line has to pass through the Songhu Railway, permission has been obtained from the Railway Bureau, and pole erection is underway, which is about to be completed. The voltage in the Dong Yokohama area will soon meet the needs of the public.</p>

He was very pleased to be welcomed by his colleagues in your country, and hoped that the Chinese and Japanese confectionery industries would join hands in the future to promote the progress of the Eastern food industry, and hoped that his colleagues present today would visit Japan. Finally, Xi Guansheng gave a speech, and the gathering ended joyfully at 10:00 p.m. It was also heard that the industry association presented a silk banner with the inscription "Leader of Modern Candy" to express their respect and commemorate the occasion.</p>

The Special Court has held separate hearings to investigate each case. Now, one case has been concluded. The day before yesterday, Judge Xun pronounced the verdict, finding Feng Lizhou guilty of defamation and fining him 50 yuan. If he fails to pay the fine, he will be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The other defendants, Zou Yunchun, Zeng Xianzhi, and Ni Gongwei, were all found not guilty.

<p>Finally Visited and Captured</p>
<p>Multiple People Detained</p>
<p>Qiu Mujin, the compradore of Taigu Company's Wuchang steamboat, had his residence at 44 Junhe Lane, Alabaster Road, broken into by several armed robbers at 10 a.m. on the 30th of last month, who looted more than 6,100 yuan of property and a Mauser pistol for self-defense. Because Qiu's chauffeur, Li Lingen, secretly observed the robbers' faces during the robbery and felt that he could recognize them if he saw them again, the Huishi police station dispatched detective Shang Wu and detective Chen Dabao, who immediately took Li to various public places to secretly investigate. At 9 p.m. the next night, they saw a male and female tourist pair walking out of the Yong'an Company's rooftop garden. Li believed that the male was indeed the robber who committed the crime at the scene, so the detective secretly followed him and saw him enter room number 4 of the Anle Palace Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. The detective then asked the French police to dispatch detectives to rush to the scene and arrest the man. He identified himself as Chen Gengsheng from Changzhou, and said that his accomplices, Zheng Guifu and Zheng Fuchang from Haimen, were bathing at the Longquan Bathhouse at 571 Zhejiang Road. The detectives rushed there and arrested them. 130 yuan in banknotes and five Han banknotes of one yuan each, a watch, and a gold ring were found on the two Zhengs. The plaintiff identified them as the original stolen goods. The day before yesterday morning, Chen Gengsheng also confessed in court the names of several accomplices who went to rob, including Fang Amao, Xu A'gen, and Fang Jinsheng, saying that after the fact, the spoils were divided, with each share being 70 yuan. Fang Amao had two pistols, so he got three shares. Xu A'gen also got three shares. The stolen jewelry was sold by Xu and Fang's wives. My uncle, A'er, worked as a chauffeur at Qiu's house. I often went to Qiu's house, and the gate was very strict. Only acquaintances would open the door. I didn't go with them when they robbed, but I got 55 yuan, a watch, and a gold ring after the fact. Zheng Fuchang confessed that Guifu was my son. I came to Shanghai from my hometown to find my son and go home. I did not participate in the robbery. Judge Wu ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for a subsequent hearing at a later date.</p>

<p>All 140 tenant households in Lizhong Lane in this city have united to oppose the rent increase by landlord Chen Changkun and have filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court requesting the validity of the contract. The court has conducted hearings on the various situations, which have been reported in this newspaper. The following is an excerpt of the key points of the response by the plaintiff tenant representatives, such as Zhu Wenxin, to the defendant Chen Changkun's counterclaim: (1) The only reason for the counterclaim is that the price of gold has soared. In fact, what does the rise and fall of the price of gold have to do with housing? The rent calculation should of course be based on the cost or purchase price. The so-called annual loss of more than 4,100 taels is unknown how it is calculated. Could it be that the cost also fluctuates with the price of gold from time to time? (2) Chen Changkun knows the previous rent amount of Lizhong Lane like the back of his hand and knows everything, but he evades and refuses to acknowledge the obligations of the written contract with Jukangzhuang, which is self-contradictory and ridiculous. (3) Regarding the part of the rent arrears, the tenants in this lane have already obtained the contract with Jukangzhuang in advance. There is no reason to increase the rent during the limited period. If the rent increase can be canceled, it will of course be paid in full.</p>

<p>Was a Gift from a Robber</p>
<p>Involved After the Case</p>
<p>Zhang Limei, the mistress of detective Hu Baoxiang, is 37 years old and has a charming appearance. Because Hu has a legal family, he hid her in number 2, Wufeng Lane, French Concession. The woman was acquainted with Zhang Dianjia. This time, Zhang and his gang robbed the resident Fang Changqing at 3 and a half Danshui Road, Gu Wang at 1032 Avenue Edward VII, Lu Wang at 1510, and Jin Hailou, a passerby who was robbed on Yunnan Road, Hankou Road. The loot was very large, so he gave a diamond ring to the woman. Recently, Zhang and his gang were arrested by the Huishi police station and confessed to giving away the stolen goods. Detectives Zhang Bingcheng, Ding Baoxiang, etc. went to the French Concession the day before yesterday and arrested Zhang Limei and brought her to the Special District Local Court. Judge Ge questioned the woman, who admitted that she had received the ring as a gift, but said that she did not know its authenticity at the time. She took it to a pawn shop for appraisal, and it was said to be an "压鼎" (a cheap ring). Then Hu Baoxiang took it away, and now he doesn't know where he threw it. Judge Ge then ordered the woman to be remanded in custody pending Hu Baoxiang's arrival and interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Special Meeting of the Cattle and Sheep Industry Guild <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Joint Petition to Abolish Inspection Fees</p>
<p>Request for Exemption from Retroactive Approval for the 19th Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Guild convened a special meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM, attended by over 530 members, due to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's order for the guild to pay overdue duplicate inspection fees for cattle and sheep for the 19th year. Chairman Chen Guanghai first reported that the Finance Bureau held a second meeting on April 16th to pursue the overdue inspection fees for the 19th year. Wang, the section chief of the Finance Bureau, stated that the Health Bureau's inspection count for the 19th year showed over 80,000 heads of cattle, which was 20,000 fewer than the Finance Bureau's count. The veterinary inspection count and the registered list would be used as the standard for cattle calculation to ensure fairness. The guild listed the actual situation of repeated drafting of inspection forms. At the previous meeting, the Health Bureau also stated that some repetitions were unavoidable, and that cattle for work, dairy, and transit, as well as sheep, were not slaughtered in the city and should not be charged fees. The calculation of 30 cents per calf should also be lowered. Yan, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, also stated that the guild was a legal entity among the industry, and that the inspection fees were apportioned and collected, so the Finance Bureau should understand the situation and exempt the guild from retroactive apportionment. There was no substantial outcome at the meeting. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has now forwarded a letter from the Finance Bureau with meeting minutes. The minutes failed to fully record the guild's statements regarding repeated drafting of inspection forms, the fact that cattle not slaughtered in the city should not be charged, and that the 30 cents per calf should be reduced. The issue of retroactive payment for the 19th year and this year's fees should be expressed. Subsequently, Zhang Wenbie of the Yellow Cattle industry and Chen Baosheng of the Goat industry proposed that the last time, colleagues especially supported the request for the government to stop collecting inspection fees, with the pig, cattle, and sheep industries undertaking the administrative expenses for livestock inspection. The chairman expressed agreement. Now that the national government has abolished exorbitant taxes and resolutely cut surtaxes to implement new business taxes, and the Ministry of Finance has notified all municipal, provincial, and county agencies that they must not collect fees similar to surtaxes or transit taxes under any name, and that those already in place should be abolished and those not yet in place should not be created. The slaughtering industry already bears slaughter taxes and now has inspection fees added, which is an unbearable burden. Moreover, new business taxes will be implemented soon. If the Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau can follow the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, he should abolish these inspection fees similar to surtaxes as soon as possible to uphold the principle of one tax per item. If the expenses for livestock inspection need to be covered, then the cattle, sheep, and pig industries can undertake them. Moreover, municipal business taxes will be implemented soon to offset the costs. The chairman suggested that since the industry guild has not been understood by the Finance Bureau, the cattle and sheep merchants should jointly petition the municipal government for survival. If the municipal government cannot understand, then they should petition the national government and various ministries. Subsequently, Yao Changsheng of the Calf industry and Chen Baosheng of the Goat industry proposed that Articles 7, 8, 9, and 3 of the slaughter inspection rules were extremely harsh and should be amended. A resolution was made to request the government to amend them. Chairman Chen Guanghai said that the Finance Bureau's pursuit of the inspection fees for the 19th year should follow the method of the second meeting, listing the repeated items and submitting them to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Finance Bureau, requesting understanding and exemption from retroactive payment. Regarding the petition, the guild was not in a position to lead it at present. Subsequently, Zhang Wenbie of the Yellow Cattle industry, Chen Baosheng of the Goat industry, You Zengfa of the Lake Sheep industry, Yao Changsheng of the Calf industry, and Jiang Fanglai and Fei Shaojin of this operation all advocated that the petition should be carried out immediately. As a result of the discussion, it was resolved that the guild should submit a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Finance Bureau for exemption from retroactive payment, and that the gold entity cattle and sheep industries should contact the pig industry to jointly petition for the abolition of pig, cattle, and sheep inspection fees.</p>
