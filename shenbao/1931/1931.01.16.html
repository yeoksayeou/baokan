<p>𢿫理舊市區以振興華界市面</p>
<p>建設新市區實現大上海計劃</p>
<p>上海市長張羣丶昨日下午丶在威海衛路四十三號市政府俱樂部丶招待新聞記者茶話丶並報告過去未來之市政丶以市政工作範圍甚廣丶昨日所談丶祇及工務與公用事業兩項丶尤注重於市中心區市政府新屋丶本年七月七日之舉行奠基丶該日爲上海特別市政府成立之五週紀念丶市政府新屋建築費丶約五十萬元丶一年竣工丶今於該日興工建築丶可謂爲建設市中心區之發軔丶亦即爲實現孫總理大上海計劃之初步也丶</p>
<p>整理舊市區效果張市長謂丶上海市政府丶成立以來丶已逾三載丶工作方面丶最重要之目的丶即在完成訓政時期之建設丶實現總理大上海之計劃丶但在過去三年之間丶多爲時勢所拘丶財力所囿丶殊愧成效之未著丶更少近功之可言丶對於舊市區之整理丶祇能維持現狀丶徐圖進展丶至若新市區之開闢丶亦僅擬具計畫丶尙未施工丶今當訓政伊始丶允宜羣策羣力</p>
<h3 id="c107">裁釐之意義與我人應有之認識 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>本黨丨中國國民黨丶是代表人民利益的黨丶所以在軍政時期丶用革命武力丶掃除一切剝削人民壓迫人民的軍閥丶在訓政時期除努力於建設事業外丶對剝削人民利益的不良制度丶也用革命手段丶加以毫不容情的剷除丶</p>
<p>厘卡起自前清咸豐三年丶當時因洪楊作亂丶兵餉窘迫丶於是首由江蘇布政使　以誠在揚州附近的仙女廟丶開始徵收厘金丶原是臨時性質丶但大亂平後丶因歲入頗豐丶於國家財政收入丶大有補益丶非特不即予裁撤丶反變本加厲丶各省都紛紛倣効丶稅率也參差不齊丶竟成了病商害民牢不可破的國內稅丶</p>
<p>全國厘卡丶現在有六百九十處之多丶說起他的弊害丶眞　竹難書丶現在舉其犖犖大者如下丶（一）剝削商人丶因厘金稅率不齊丶商人無從計算他負担的輕重與盈餘的厚薄丶遂視商業爲畏途丶中央政府丶無統一的法令丶聽任各省官吏丶任意增减丶搜括剝削丶無所不爲丶加以舞弊中飽丶藉端敲索丶於是稅吏如虎狼丶小商成羔羊丶重重查騐步步剝削丶一貨一物之微丶往往因關卡之留難丶延擱一年之久丶亦不以爲怪丶（二）妨害實業丶實業爲一國經濟之命脈丶中國實業所以至今不振丶其原因丶即基於厘金制度的存在丶同一貨物丶洋貨祗須在海口納入口稅百分之五丶和子口稅百分之二·五後丶便可通行全國丶暢銷無阻丶國貨則不然丶自出產地運至銷售地丶重重厘卡丶苛徵暴歛丶於是同一價值貨物丶洋貨因稅輕定價低廉丶國貨則稅重而成本加重丶於是洋貨暢銷丶土貨呆滯丶厘金之妨害實業丶簡直是直接妨害國家之經濟命脈丶（三）增加人民負担丶良好的國稅丶應採取一直接﹂的原別丶使納稅人不以加重的稅金轉嫁於他人丶譬如一件貨物丶因厘金徵稅過重丶商人當然不能賠本出售丶於是把物價抬高丶一般消費的人民丶因而加重負担丶現在物價騰貴丶生計維艱丶可說全受厘金之賜丶（四）貪汚的製造所丶中國依賴厘金而吃飯的丶據準確統計丶有一百六十萬人丶他們的技巧丶便是拍馬夤緣丶他們的本領丶便是吸榨搜刮丶得厘金肥缺後丶不數年便可腰纒鉅萬丶面團團作富家翁丶而全國商人小販丶以及一般人民丶却直接間接丶供他犧牲丶陷於虧折確產丶日趨窮困之境丶富商鉅機丶或可藉官廳爲護符丶堂皇偷漏丶卡吏亦不敢過問丶最受切膚之痛的丶便是一般負担甚重汗血資本的小商人丶厘金制度丶眞是萬惡丶</p>
<p>本黨孫中山先生鑒於厘金之罪惡丶所以在中國國民黨的政綱中丶毫無疑義的加上了裁撤厘金一條丶國民政府也就毅然决然在民國二十年元旦起下令一律裁撤丶</p>
<p>不管人家反地丶說撤厘以後丶一百六十萬人丶勢將無以餬口丶但試問因一百六十萬的蛀米蟲生計問題丶便可以連累三萬萬九千餘萬人民的生計不安嗎丶小軍閥和地方惡紳作梗丶這是革命政府下應有的顧慮嗎丶至於國家財政要發生恐慌丶也可以把海關二·五附加稅丶切實徵收丶當然也可以借此挹注丶並且將來海關完全自主後丶稅率增加丶收入祗有加多丶决無恐慌之虞丶</p>
<p>所以這次裁撤厘金丶本黨抱了很大的决心丶政府用了最大的努力來幹的丶决不有所顧忌丶而退縮或變通丶希望全國民衆丶在政府盡力剷除粃政之時丶予以很大的帮助與促成丶我們底口號丶是擁護國民政府的裁厘政策丶裁厘是實現本黨政綱丶裁厘是促成訓政的工作丶裁厘是求中國經濟自由平等解放的初步丶反對裁厘丶便是革命的叛徒丶民衆的公敵丶全國人民丶一致輔助政府裁厘丶中國國民黨萬歲丶</p>

<p>陳保勤女士</p>
<p>舊友王君。川人。客歲抱病。停學返里。今病告愈。復買舟東下。日前抵滬。故友重逢。欣喜可知。昨晚爲之洗塵。席間詢及川中近况。王君對於軍閥橫行無忌。目無法紀之行爲。頗爲桑梓惋惜。而尤以某軍閥獵艶一事。堪稱奇聞。爰筆記之。</p>
<p>某軍閥者。素據蓉城。本不通翰墨。唯以其位高爵顯。若被人目爲白丁。殊屬有失尊嚴。於是乃囑秘書爲之擬稿。熟讀之後。四出演講。以博人之信仰。一日至某女中講演。見二生絕艷。比肩而坐。某軍閥雖有姬妾數十人。此時仍不得不爲之顚倒。求凰之念。油然而生。歸而謀諸左右。適其妾輩中。亦有在該女校掛名肄業者。故知二女爲姊妹花。蓉城世家楊某之女公子也。並探得楊素有芙蓉癖。遂使人往捕之。判罰十餘萬金。楊氏遭此劇變。計無所出。二女忽憶及軍長有某妾與己爲同學。因逕往求助。某妾爲求寵起見。果甚熱心。惟以己身無能爲力。願爲二女分紹。謁見軍長。二女以救父情急。雖犧牲一切。亦在所不惜。遂含羞往見。某軍閥佯作不知。問二女以何事來訪。二女具以告。某軍閥聞後佯怒。詢係何人所爲。必欲得而甘心。並令速釋楊父。向二女道歉。且欵待殷勤。留餐而返。楊父處此淫威之下。雖洞知個中譎計。亦不敢不與之周旋。返家後。遂設嘉筵以謝厚德。酒酣樂甚。某秘書以締姻請。楊父佯諾之。但請稍待時日。以便購辦一切嫁奩。某軍閥</p>

<p>·璧·人</p>
<p>愛沙尼爾共和國。乃沿波羅的海之一小國也。近發生　　一法律上疑難事。傳爲趣聞。緣該國定例。凡犯罪而判處極刑者。由犯人自擇死法。死法有二。曰服毒。曰縊殺。近有一判死罪之囚。自願服毒。監刑官予以毒藥。該犯公然呑服。毫不畏懼。乃服毒後並不斃命。僅患病數星期。即完全恢復健康。且對此種毒藥之抵抗力益强。遂使該國當局爲之大窘。按律犯人服藥之量。有嚴格之規定。不能逾量。若疊次與服。又非人道主義所許。而該犯拒絕絞殺。亦爲其所有權。因此艱於處置。大約該犯可因之不死。而恢復自由。蓋就法理言。其所受之刑罰。固已一度執行也。</p>
<p>以爲然。遂約定月後成婚。此一月中。楊父派人四出購物。以杜其疑。及吉日。並無動靜。某軍閥方知受愚。乃大舉搜索。而楊氏全家已杳如黃鶴矣。某軍閥雖震怒。亦無如之何。劉氏抵宜後。乃函某軍閥。痛駡之。亦快事也。</p>

<p>吾鄉張詩舲先生。（即張祥河）通顯後歷官內外。故鄉風味。淡焉若忘。自致仕回梓里。適在秋冬之候。即效張季鷹之思食鱸膾。呼廚者沽而烹之。廚乃　江人。未諳其法。不將薄膜皮洗去。而即煑於鍋中。先生下箸後。覺風味平常。滑膩不適口。乃云數十年未嘗故鄉佳味。一旦得食。反不如前。豈物有變異乎。彼詩酒風流之老先生。何憒憒乃爾。　　左文襄公宗棠。開府兩江。來松大閱。習聞松江四腮鱸。獨擅異味。命中軍官善沽而食。一時急切無所覓。即購花鼓魚俗云蕩鯉魚形狀類似而頭上無腮。身上有鱗。代之以獻。而公未之知也。食時齒頰流涎。津津有味。逮回督轅。猶與僚屬樂道。謂爲生平快事。甚矣君子可欺以其方也。</p>
<p>金壇馮蒿叟。（即馮夢老）退歸林下。寄跡滬濱。探知我鄉美味。於何時上市。即乘車來松怡値四腮鱸正盛。購得十餘尾以去。不勝欣喜。奈所雇廚子。不合烹法。煎炒以醬油酒醋。而不以醃肉湯相煑。蒿叟食之。油膩無味。酸氣觸鼻。乃云美味未嘗美。何松地物產之徒有虛名也。噫·不責廚子而責特產。於蒿叟原字。蓋眞名副其實。而有負此美味矣。</p>

<p>在死刑犯的牢房內。托尼斯加見到那穿着襤褸的。發熱得戰慄着的。在受刑前已沒有氣力支持自已的死刑犯。托尼斯加狠動了憐憫心。伊最初想法子使他感動。其次給他許多鼓勵。當那兇惡的劊子手在隔壁屋內等着時候到來行刑時。托尼斯加使死刑犯玩着那小商人給伊的玩具。快樂得像一個小孩子一樣。天亮時。死刑犯走去受刑了。但他腦中保存着一個最美的回憶。影片演到這地方。在我個人的意思是應當沉默的。但製片者却在這兒揷進一段祈禱的歌唱。我以爲這是這影片的唯一缺點。有聲影片是常有這種缺點的。</p>
<p>當托尼斯加回到妓館時。伊的姊妹們和那妓館的顧客都譏笑伊。呌伊作﹁絞犯的寡婦﹂。隨後大家都把伊看作一件不祥之物避開伊。不久伊便被這家妓館逐出。而祗好在街上徘徊了。伊的綽號﹁絞犯的寡婦﹂還保存着。伊在街頭常是被人欺侮。</p>
<p>一天晚上伊遇着伊的未婚夫。伊被未婚夫帶回村中預備舉行婚禮。結婚的前一晚。伊的未婚夫會見詐多常常在一家酒店相叙的朋友。一個小商人告訴他道。我也認識一個呌做托尼斯加的女了。這女子狠美。大家都呌伊﹁絞犯的寡婦﹂。接着他便把那段故事說出了。並拿出托尼斯加的照片爲證。托尼斯加的未婚夫聽着這話。馬上跑去痛責伊。伊從全村人的辱駡聲中逃走了。</p>

<p>很爲歡迎伊。。這個歡迎之意。。其實是完全出於好奇心。。人人心中。。以爲這位女偉人。。不知怎樣的生得威武出衆。。都想見一見。。以擴眼界。。及至看見了以後。。人也覺得和尋常一位太太們無異。。說話之間。。非常謙和。。並無劍拔弩張之勢。。便是對於他們房間裏一班人。。也是客客氣氣。。一點不搭架。。因講到了從前組織女子革命軍的事。。任佩眞便說。。背了那枝槍走路。。實在覺得累贅。。起初以爲一支槍重量有限。。不過十斤二十斤的分量罷了。。那裏知道越背越重。。俗語說的﹁百步以外無輕擔﹂這話是不錯的。。像我倒還好。。本來是天足。。沒有包過脚的。。有兩位姊妹。。他們的脚。。是放大脚。。一搖一擺。。那裏走得動。。走不上兩里路。。早已面紅氣促了。。後來我們看不過。。說走不動是無可勉强的。。但是他們志切從軍。。這個志氣。。倒地可以欽敬的呢。。左詩晨道。。就因爲當時無論男女。。萬衆一心。。所以革命成功。。把滿洲政府革掉了。。其實女子不必一定要從軍。。在後方可做的事也很多。。譬如看護受傷的軍士。。料量軍人所需的衣服。。也是一樣的爲國出力。。何必一定要抗着槍到前敵去呢。。就是要槍的。。弄幾支輕巧些兒的手槍。。不是要好得多嗎。。任佩眞笑道。。你眞說得好太平話兒。。那時候領得到槍枝。。已經是不容易的了。。怎能教你揀精揀肥的要手槍。。有幾枝手槍。。長官佩帶還不夠。。那裏能普及到許多人。。便是我們女子革命軍。。領到二十支槍。。也已經是很麻煩的了。。他們說。。你們的槍。。不過擺擺樣而已。。反正未必到前線開火。。差一點也沒有什麼關係。。你想這句話。。氣死人不氣死人。。分明駡我們的女子革命軍。。反正也不過擺擺樣而已。。左詩晨道。。那倒也不是這們說。。就生理上說起來。。女子的體質。。和男子相差得多。。無論那一國。。女子本沒有當兵的義務。。不過在革命時代。。婦女已是國民。。當然也激起義勇的心。。我們歷史上。。女子爲將領的倒有。。女子當兵士的却少。。因爲運幃幄。。也許有知識傑出的人材。。衝鋒陷陣。。到底不是女子的事了。。任佩眞點頭道。。所以到後來也就解散了。。老實一句話。。大家也嘆有起這個苦。。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Recovery of the Tianjin Belgian Concession <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Handover Ceremony</p>
<p>Exchange of Ratified Agreement Notifications</p>
<p>Lowering of the Belgian Flag, Hoisting of the Chinese Flag</p>
<p>Zang and Wang Host Banquet for Chinese and Belgian Representatives</p>
<p>Tianjin Citizens Hold Celebration Rally</p>
<p>Belgian Minister to Tianjin, Baron de Bassompierre, has not recovered from his illness. On the 14th evening, he sent his representative, M. Jacqueton, to the Yuzhong Hotel to exchange ratified agreement notifications. The notification stated that it would take effect from the time of exchange. On the 15th, at 11:00 AM, a handover ceremony was held at the Belgian Concession Bureau. Over 300 Chinese and foreign guests attended. Upon hearing the news, over a thousand citizens rushed to witness the ceremony. The Belgian Consul-General, Mr. Wang Desen, representing the Belgian government, reported on the negotiation process for returning the Belgian Concession. The Belgian national anthem was played, and the Belgian flag was lowered. Then, the Chinese national anthem was played, and the Chinese and Belgian flags were raised side by side, amidst thunderous applause. Guests bowed to the national flags. The Chinese receiving commissioner, Zang Qifang, gave a speech, briefly stating that today the Belgian Concession is being taken over and will be managed by the Tianjin Municipal Government. We should strive to do two things: (1) A diplomatic victory cannot be achieved by the central government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs alone. All citizens should unite and serve as the government's support. We will not hesitate to sacrifice ourselves, and it cannot be achieved merely by holding meetings and shouting slogans. We must have determination and work practically. Since the establishment of the National Government, the recovery of sovereignty has been in progress, and Belgium is the first to return the Belgian Concession. Such a spirit of equality and fraternity is truly admirable. (2) Based on the spirit of equality and fraternity, it should be extended to the international community. If everyone treats each other with equality, then international inequality will naturally decrease. For the sake of international justice and peace, we should all have this awareness. China and Belgium have always enjoyed friendly relations. Today's unconditional return of this concession marks a new era in China-Belgium relations. It is hoped that all countries in the world will usher in a new era in their relations. At noon, the ceremony concluded. Zang hosted a banquet for Chinese and Belgian representatives at his residence. At 3:00 PM, Zang sent Ning Xiangnan and Lu Lu to take over furniture and documents. The Belgian Concession Bureau Director, Mr. Martens, completed the handover. At 5:00 PM, the Belgian flag was lowered, and from the 16th onwards, the Chinese flag would be hoisted. After the handover ceremony, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Zhang Xueming, convened a meeting with the patrol officers, briefly stating that everyone previously served Belgium. Today, with the recovery of the concession's sovereignty, everyone should continue to serve with peace of mind. Various provincial and municipal agencies, organizations, companies, schools, and factories were given a one-day holiday. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Tianjin, 2:00 PM: The Municipal Party Headquarters convened a citizens' celebration rally. Liu Butong presided, and Wang Zhengting delivered a speech, first recounting the history of the Belgian Concession and the negotiation process for its recovery. He then stated that the Qing Dynasty was ignorant of foreign affairs, or was deceived and oppressed, leading to the signing of various unequal treaties. Today, with the recovery of the Belgian Concession, one of the wounds of inequality has been eliminated, which is somewhat comforting. However, in diplomacy, a certain procedure is valued, and a thorough determination is even more valued. In addition to the Tianjin Belgian Concession, those already recovered include Zhenjiang, Xiamen, the British Concession, and Weihaiwei British Leased Territory. Those currently in the process of recovery include the Gulangyu International Settlement, and the Hankou Japanese and French Concessions. The recovery of all other concessions and leased territories should proceed gradually, striving to clear away the administrative constraints suffered for more than eighty years after the achievement of tariff autonomy and legal jurisdiction recovery. After the recovery of all concessions and leased territories, our country will strengthen the protection of the lives and property of all foreigners, hoping for the understanding of foreigners. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Wang hosted a banquet at the Xihu Hotel on the 15th evening for Chinese and Belgian representatives and various dignitaries, with over sixty people in attendance. Wang gave a lengthy speech, briefly stating that the true value of diplomacy lies in removing obstacles to international peace and cooperation. The far-sightedness of the Belgian diplomatic authorities is greatly admired. In July 1845, the Chinese Emperor permitted Belgium to have trading rights in China. Twenty years later, the Sino-Belgian Treaty was signed, allowing Belgian merchants to enjoy the same benefits as other countries. During the World War from 1904 to 1918, Belgium was the first to bear the brunt, and China joined the Allied Powers, defeating the power. This is a merit of Sino-Belgian friendship. In 1925, Belgium returned the Boxer Indemnity for China's industrial, cultural, and charitable purposes, and abolished the old treaty, exchanging it for a new treaty of equality. This time, it unconditionally returned the Tianjin Concession. Today, Belgium can adapt to the new era's doctrine with an equal new policy, promoting friendly relations with neighboring countries, and will surely gain the goodwill of the Chinese people. If other countries want to gain the goodwill of the Chinese people, they should also follow Belgium's model. Now, all countries want to find a market in the Far East. I think whoever can gain the goodwill of the Chinese people will get China as their market. This kind of work is like Belgium returning the Tianjin Concession today. Today, with the recovery of the Belgian Concession, the government will definitely manage it meticulously, strive for development, and live up to Belgium's good intentions in returning it.</p>
<p>Raising the glass, I respectfully wish the King of Belgium, Albert, good health and long life, and the eternal friendship between the two countries. The Belgian Consul-General replied, in addition to wishing the Republic of China longevity and President Chiang good health, he also stated that the Belgian government's return of the Tianjin Concession was without any conditions. He hoped that people from all countries would understand. Finally, he wished that the Sino-Belgian friendship would become even closer. The banquet ended at 10:00 PM in joyful spirits. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Wang is scheduled to travel to Peiping by train on the 16th evening. During his return trip south, he will inspect Weihaiwei and Qingdao. Xu Mo plans to return to Nanjing first due to the heavy workload of the European and American Affairs Department. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Tianjin Municipal Government issued a telegram on the 15th evening, reporting on the handover of the Belgian Concession. Minister Wang also telegraphed the National Government, reporting on everything. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Peiping: Today, the Municipal Party Headquarters held a celebration meeting for the recovery of the Tianjin Belgian Concession. Dong Lin presided, with over a hundred people from various agencies in attendance. Airplanes flew over Tianjin, and flags were hung throughout the city. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Peiping: Baron de Bassompierre, the Belgian Minister, suffered a heart attack yesterday morning while preparing to go to Tianjin to participate in the concession return ceremony. Dr. Crell and the Minister's wife went to Tianjin for medical care. Crell returned to Peiping, saying there was no cause for concern. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>The Implementation Law for the Election of Representatives to the National Assembly in Nanjing, drafted by Hu Hanmin, was submitted for discussion at the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 15th.

<p>(4) Those who are members of two organizations at the same time are allowed to prepare rosters of both organizations, and the election supervisor will review and determine one of them.</p>
<p>(5) If an individual believes there are errors or omissions in the roster after it is announced, they may submit evidence within five days after the announcement to the Election Supervisor, who will forward it to the General Election Supervisor for verification. (6) In districts where the number of representatives is less than five, all organizations in the district will hold a joint election.</p>

<p>Nanjing: After the implementation of the new tariff by the Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent smuggling along the border and coast, it requested that all steamships or motorboats under 250 tons be prohibited from sailing between domestic and foreign ports. Violators will have their ships and cargo confiscated and confiscated. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to discuss and respond. The Ministry of Finance considered that before the recovery of inland navigation rights lost in unequal treaties, no restrictions should be placed on merchant ships sailing between domestic and foreign ports to avoid burdening the domestic shipping industry. However, smuggling hinders tax revenue, and prevention should not be delayed. In order to consider both, it seems that the customs authorities should expand the anti-smuggling agency and tighten its organization. If the Ministry of Finance believes that the short-term solution is to restrict this type of ship, it is not enough to prevent tax evasion. Chinese shipping is still in its infancy, and the tonnage of ships is mostly only about 100 tons. It can only be temporarily set at 100 tons, following the British example. Steamships and motorboats under this size are not allowed to sail between domestic and foreign ports, so that protection is still implied in the restriction. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Important European Conferences <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>One of the most important European conferences recently is the World Disarmament Conference, which is scheduled to open on March 1st. The conference is intended to include all countries in the world, not just the great powers, and preparations are currently underway. It is the final conference to achieve universal disarmament, and its success or failure will determine the peace and security of the world. The second is the European Federal Planning Committee, which has representatives from eighteen countries including Germany, France, England, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Lithuania, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. The European Union Committee will be chaired by French Foreign Minister Briand, and former Dutch Finance Minister Colijn will discuss the European economic situation. Whether Russia and Turkey will be invited will be discussed at the first committee meeting. It is also reported that China and Japan will also send representatives to attend as observers.</p>
<p>The first of these two important conferences belongs to the entire world, but focuses on European countries. If European countries can sincerely disarm and reduce various military preparations, then the countries of other continents will naturally be able to unite. The second belongs only to Europe, but if the European Federation is established, its benefits will reach other continents, not just superficially. Just as when European countries engage in war, such as after the European War, the countries of other continents are also affected, not just superficially.</p>

<p>Someone Stole and Sold Design Drawings for a High Price</p>
<p>But the Wu Factory Denies Any Loss</p>
<p>Seoul, 15th (Electric Communication Agency) Regarding the serious incident of the leakage of military secrets of the warship Nagato, the authorities conducted a secret investigation and prohibited publication. On the 10th of this month, the interrogation of those involved was completed, and all documents were sent to the Seoul District Court Prosecutor's Office. Part of the article was also declassified today. The contents of the incident are as follows: There is a pro-Japanese traitor named Zongzheng Qili, who was formerly a drafting worker at the Wu Naval Factory, and privately stole dozens of design drawings of the Nagato, intending to sell them to foreigners. In May of the ninth year of Taisho, he told Jiuhe Baitsuru, the female waitress of the coffee shop he operated, and asked her to find a way to dispose of them. Last July, Baitsuru was hired at the Kirin coffee shop in Honmachi, Seoul, and met Hasegawa Kiyoshi, a diplomat from the Yufeng Trading Company, a leather merchant in Ichome, Hwanggeum-dong, Seoul, and Ishigaki Isamu, a shoemaker from Yongsan Samgakji. She discussed with them the matter of selling the design drawings of the Nagato to foreigners. Hasegawa took over the handling of this matter and handed over the drawings to a certain foreigner in Seoul several times, demanding a selling price of 50,000 yuan. However, this foreigner, realizing the seriousness of the matter, reported it to the Foreign Affairs Section of the Governor-General's Office and returned the drawings. The police then launched a major operation and arrested all the criminals involved. The case is being tried by the Seoul District Court.</p>
<p>Wu, 15th (Electric Communication Agency) An Electric Communication Agency reporter visited the Wu factory regarding the Nagato incident. According to Colonel Takeda Iyuuki, General Manager of the Wu Factory, it has been 15 years since the warship Nagato was launched. There is no idiot who would spend tens of thousands of yuan to buy this design drawing, and this factory has never lost this important design drawing. It is feared that it is a self-made drawing, falsely claiming to be a design drawing to sell to others. The factory has always denied the loss of the design drawing.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Indian Round Table Conference <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Continued Riots in Mumbai</p>
<p>London, 14th (Reuters) There was an important development in the Tribal Committee's discussion of Hindu-Muslim disputes at today's Indian Round Table Conference. Sir Shafi, a Muslim representative, proposed a new solution and declared that the dispute could be resolved if this solution was accepted. Dr. Monkhi, a Hindu representative, responded in moderate tones. Chairman MacDonald, the British Prime Minister, then announced a recess to allow the two sides to talk. Shafi said that the main difficulty in repeated negotiations on tribal issues was the issue of political rights in Bengal and Punjab. The majority of the population in these two provinces are Muslims. Today, he was instructed by the Muslim representatives to propose a new solution. Muslims should have 49% of the seats in the Punjab Assembly and 46% of the seats in Bengal, and have the right to compete for seats in special constituencies. As for Muslims in other provinces, they should continue to enjoy their existing political rights and continue to elect separately. In the future, if two-thirds of the members of any provincial or central assembly agree to switch to a joint election system, then the province or central government can implement a joint election system. Although Muslims are in the majority of the people in Bengal, this solution will permanently keep them in the minority in terms of political rights. What they can hope to win in the special constituencies is only one seat at the University of Dhaka. As for the Muslims in Punjab Province, they can only win about two seats in the special constituencies, and even more one seat. The above is the final solution for Muslims, and cannot accept a greater sacrifice. After the Chairman announced a recess, a private meeting was held. It is heard that the only difficulty lies in the issue of seats in the Punjab Assembly. Hindus and Muslims now have no disagreements. Only the Sikh representatives still insist that Sikhs must occupy 24% of the seats in the Punjab Assembly.</p>

In addition, the railway issued public bonds worth 350 million Spanish currency. However, after deducting all income and expenses, a surplus of 64 million Spanish currency can still be achieved. It is also heard that the Spanish government has ordered several 38 cm caliber cannons with a length of 20 km and a range of 35 km from the United Kingdom. Each cannon costs about £80,000 and will be installed in coastal fortresses.</p>

<p>Cash Flow to Be Regulated</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 14th) The Bank of France has historically accepted gold bars with a purity standard of 995 per mille. Now it has decided that henceforth, gold bars with a purity standard of 900 per mille and above will be accepted. From now on, the purity standard for gold acceptance in France will be the same as that of the Bank of England, which is 916.66 per mille. Previously, gold transported from London to France had to be re-refined, which was time-consuming and inconsistent. Now that France has changed its policy, more gold may flow from London to Paris. However, it is generally expected that cash flow will soon be regulated.</p>

<p>Opening of the National Internal Affairs Conference</p>
<p>Chairman Liu Shangqing, Vice Chairman Zhang Wohua</p>
<p>Chairman's Address Chairman Liu Shangqing said in his address: "The Internal Affairs Conference was originally scheduled to be held in the autumn of last year, but due to the impact of the political situation, it was postponed until today. During the period of political tutelage, if we want to seek the development of all undertakings, we must regard the clarification of internal affairs as the first element. Moreover, in this time of local devastation, we must have good intentions and sound laws regarding internal affairs to remedy the situation. China is vast and populous, and the customs and conditions of the people cannot be completely the same. Without good internal affairs as a standard, it will be difficult to achieve uniformity in the system. National administration emphasizes unity. The provinces have the responsibility to implement the decrees of the central government. Although sometimes, due to special circumstances, some modifications must be made, there can be no differences in the general outline of internal affairs. Now that the political situation is settled, this is the only opportunity to unify internal affairs. If we fail to reform in time, causing construction to fail to progress, then those who bear administrative responsibility will be unable to answer to the nation above and unable to comfort the people below. The main reason for convening this conference is to reform the nation's internal politics and relieve the suffering of the people. I hope that everyone will express their honest opinions and study all proposals as much as possible to determine the most precise and complete implementation policy to meet the needs of the period of political tutelage and enhance the value of this conference."</p>
<p>Address by the Central Government Representative Central Government Representative Wang Chonghui said in his address: "Today, the Internal Affairs Conference is opening, and I am entrusted by the central government to participate in this grand event. This conference was originally scheduled to be held last year, but it was delayed until today due to the obstruction of reactionary elements. The obstruction of reactionary elements last year was not limited to internal affairs. This year, however, there is unity and a good prospect for new construction. A nation standing in the world is like a person standing in society. If a person is not healthy, they cannot withstand the cold and heat. If a nation is not healthy, it cannot withstand foreign aggression. Therefore, a person must be strong to stand in society, and a nation must be politically strong to stand in the world. Although the time allotted for this Internal Affairs Conference is short, all the proposals are very important. The policies of our party, except for foreign policy, are all within the scope of internal affairs. The clarification of internal affairs should start with suppressing bandits, clearing household registration, improving police administration, and social hygiene. There are many things that belong to internal affairs, and the scope is very broad. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that all construction must start from the root, like building a house, we must first lay the foundation. He also said that the people are the foundation of the nation, and everything should be approached from a high standpoint and implemented from a low standpoint. That is, building a house must first lay the foundation, and governing a country must first establish self-government. Local self-government is the most important work of internal affairs. Now is the period of political tutelage, and I hope that self-government will be completed as soon as possible to fulfill the mission of our party. The significance of today's meeting is that the central government is planning a unified plan for internal affairs. The circumstances and customs of each locality are different, and representatives from all provinces and cities can also express their opinions to eliminate the separation between the central government and the localities. All the members present are incumbent officials with rich knowledge and experience. The results of this conference will surely be good. I now represent the central government in wishing the Internal Affairs Conference success and the clarification of internal affairs success."</p>
<p>Address by Chairman Chiang Chairman of the National Government Chiang Kai-shek said in his address: "Today, the Internal Affairs Conference is opening, and I would like to take this opportunity to offer a few things to everyone. The military affairs have now ended, and we are now implementing the period of political tutelage. Our Dr. Sun Yat-sen wrote many books in his lifetime and left behind many teachings for us, in which he described item by item what should be done during the period of political tutelage. Therefore, at this time, we should consider how to put Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings into practice under the current circumstances. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said, 'If it is difficult, make it easy,' meaning that those who know can naturally do it, and even those who do not know can do it. Because Dr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrines and policies are already detailed and complete, there is no need to study them, and they can be implemented directly. This Internal Affairs Conference brings together civil affairs experts from all over the country. We will surely be able to gather ideas and benefit from each other. However, the circumstances of each province are different, and there is much separation between the central government and the localities. Therefore, in the middle of this conference, we should study the methods of implementation in the future. As for how to stabilize the chaotic social situation, how to relieve the suffering of the people, how to correct the people's habits of listlessness, and how to change the habits of officials and governments who are complacent, all of these are the greatest responsibilities of this Internal Affairs Conference. Therefore, each representative should make those who are listless invigorated and those who are complacent changed, and fulfill their responsibilities and duties with a revolutionary spirit. As for how to protect the lives of the people, how to stabilize the hearts of society, and how to solve the people's livelihood, these responsibilities should be borne by all representatives. If the above-mentioned things cannot be done, it means that the internal affairs personnel cannot fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, this conference is different from the previous situation during the military period. We should pay attention to the methods of implementation and no longer talk about proposals in vain. Now that the military affairs have come to an end, each province and region has a considerable military force to suppress bandits and communists. Therefore, at this time, each representative should follow the plan and determine the internal affairs policy. The most important thing is to stabilize society, relieve the suffering of the people, and completely eliminate corrupt officials. Today, I hope that everyone will follow the Outline of National Reconstruction and not go beyond this scope or be unrealistically ambitious. If we can follow the Outline of National Reconstruction, then the foundation of the nation can be consolidated and we can achieve equality and independence with other countries in the world. Otherwise, there will be no way to manage internal affairs. I hope that everyone will work together to encourage each other."</p>
<p>Speech by Wang Boqun Minister of Transportation Wang Boqun said in his speech: "The importance of the Internal Affairs Conference has already been explained in great detail by President Wang and Chairman Chiang. I would like to add a few more opinions. The scope of internal affairs is very broad. National affairs, except for military and foreign affairs, all belong to internal affairs. In terms of transportation, it is also one of the internal affairs. Because only when internal affairs are clear can transportation be constructed. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said, 'A country is the accumulation of people, and people are the accumulation of minds. The goodness or badness of politics is all tied to the psychology of people.' We believe that the renewal of politics lies not only in having good regulations, but also in having good officials. Because the clarification of politics and the cultivation of officials must be given equal importance."</p>
<p>Members' Response Chen Wenxue, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Liaoning Province, delivered a response on behalf of all members: "Today, the Internal Affairs Conference is holding its opening ceremony. Members are honored to be able to gather in the capital and participate in this grand event. We are also honored to receive sincere guidance from the central government representatives, the chairman of the National Government, the chairman of this conference, and the guests. However, internal affairs are the foundation of the nation, and the relationship is the most important. Looking back on the past internal affairs, although the circumstances of each province are different, there are actually no achievements to speak of. The members are ashamed. Now that the central government has quelled the great chaos and unified the country, the only thing that is necessary is to clarify internal affairs. As this is the beginning of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the central government has convened the Internal Affairs Conference, showing the determination of the central government to renew internal affairs and clarify politics. The members will respectfully accept the instructions, work harder, and concentrate on discussing all proposals in detail to obtain a good and concrete method. In the future, after returning to the provinces, we will also follow the resolutions and earnestly implement them to live up to the central government's intention to clarify internal affairs."</p>

<h3 id="e70">Wang Jinyu Directs Troops to Suppress Bandits in Pingxiang <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Armies on the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border Unite as One</p>
<p>Chiang Orders the 18th Division to Replenish and Restore to Original State</p>
<p>Han and Xu Divisions Ordered to Enter Jiangxi to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The Xiushui, Wuning, Tonggu, Wanzai, Lianhua, Pingjiang, Liuyang, Tongshan, and Tongcheng areas on the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border have been severely devastated by the bandits led by Kong Hechong, Li Shi, and Li Can. Since the Fourth Route Army conquered Pingjiang and Liuyang, Kong and Li bandits have been wreaking havoc on Xiushui and Tonggu and threatening Wuning and Ruichang. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief Chiang appointed Wang Jinyu as the bandit suppression director of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border, responsible for clearing the bandits in that area. According to a telegram from Pingxiang, Wang Jinyu arrived in Pingxiang from Hunan on the 12th and immediately led his troops to suppress the bandits in Lianhua and Wanzai. As for Hao Mengling's 54th Division under Wang's command, after entering Jiangxi from Hubei, it advanced from Nanxun to aid Wuning. Yesterday, Staff Officer Wu of the division's office in the province received a telegram from Division Commander Hao, stating that his troops had arrived at the designated location and that he would lead the division headquarters to Wuning on the Eastern Day. He has established contact with the divisions of Chen Guangzhong, Tao Guang, and Xie Bin in Xiushui and Tonggu and has united with Wang Jinyu's troops stationed in Pingxiang. The various units have begun searching and suppressing the bandits in the Wugong Mountains area bordering the three provinces and have set a deadline for clearing them out.</p>
<p>On the first day of this month, the 18th Division of the Ninth Route Army fought fiercely with bandits at Longgangxu. Due to the dangerous terrain, the 52nd and 53rd Brigades were completely wiped out, losing four to five thousand rifles. Division Commander Zhang and Brigade Commander Wang were captured by the communists. It is rumored that Zhang and Wang died unyielding, but it is not known for sure. It is said that Commander-in-Chief Chiang greatly appreciated and regretted Division Commander Zhang's brave bandit suppression, which resulted in heavy sacrifices. He has approved the division's replenishment and restoration to its original state to show encouragement. However, as of now, the whereabouts of Division Commander Zhang are still unknown. Commander-in-Chief Lu and all walks of life are deeply saddened. Mrs. Zhang has also gone to Wuhan to find ways to rescue him. In addition, Vice Division Commander Dai was recently appointed as the Nanchang Garrison Commander and took office on the 10th, gathering officers and soldiers to give a speech, urging them to pay attention to winter defense and consolidate security amid the tense bandit suppression. Dai has been in the 18th Division for a long time, and there is talk of him acting as the division commander of the 18th Division. According to military sources, after receiving the news of the defeat of the Jiangxi bandit suppression army, Chiang ordered Han Deqin's 52nd Division and Xu Tingyao's 4th Division to enter Jiangxi to assist in the suppression. Recently, Lu received a telegram from Division Commander Han, stating that the 154th and 156th Brigades under Xu Zhibai of his unit could be concentrated in Nanchang before the 15th. Xu's 4th Division is also being transported from Beijing to Jiangxi and will arrive within a week. (January 14)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Anhui Province Increases Salt Tax Surcharge in Northern Anhui <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Chambers of Commerce Unanimously Oppose</p>
<p>Bengbu Communication: The salt tax surcharge in Anhui Province was originally collected in the counties along the Anhui coast. Recently, the provincial government, due to financial difficulties with the provincial defense military, decided to extend the collection to Zhejiang salt in southern Anhui and Huai and Lu salt in northern Anhui, uniformly increasing the provincial defense surcharge by two yuan and forty cents per load, following the precedent of the Anhui coast. Special bureaus were established in Tunxi in southern Anhui and Bengbu in northern Anhui to collect the surcharge, and Duan Shizhang was appointed as the director of the Anhui Provincial Defense Salt Tax Surcharge Northern Anhui Collection Bureau. After being appointed, Duan came to Bengbu at the end of last month and established the bureau in the residence of a Mr. Xi on Zhongxin Street, scheduled to start collecting on the 10th. The chambers of commerce in various counties and towns in northern Anhui believe that the Anhui provincial salt surcharge was previously canceled by the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation's telegram to the provincial government, and it was not approved. They now believe that the burden is too heavy and strongly oppose it, sending representatives Yang Yaonan and others to Beijing to appeal to the Ministry of Finance for cancellation. Due to the financial difficulties of merchants in Jiangsu, the salt transported by various transporters is piled up on ships and they are unwilling to transport it ashore to pay the surcharge. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Anhui provincial government ordering the cancellation. However, the newly established Anhui Provincial Defense Salt Tax Surcharge Northern Anhui Collection Bureau in Bengbu is mandated by the provincial government to collect the surcharge. A few days ago, it sent an official letter to the Bengbu General Chamber of Commerce and the Salt and Grain Guild, asking them to inform the merchants to quickly report to the bureau to pay the surcharge in order to issue tickets for release, stating that it was ordered by the Department of Finance and must be done immediately and that salt ships would not be released without the surcharge ticket issued by the bureau.

<h3 id="e72">Relief Issues After Abolishing Likin in Fujian Province <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Government Asks Ministry of Finance for Financial Assistance</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: After Fujian Province was ordered to abolish likin, it abolished all taxes with the nature of transit tax, such as parcel tax, fertilizer tax, candle tax, brick and tile tax, cargo ship tax, and firewood and rice tax. The currently handled sugar, tea, bamboo, wood, oil, livestock, seafood, hardware, and various consumption taxes were also suspended. The Financial Special Envoy's Office began to handle the closure on January 1st and will implement the abolition on February 1st. However, after the abolition of the above taxes, the annual income will decrease by about five million yuan. Although the Department of Finance is preparing to implement a business tax to make up for it, it is currently uncertain how much revenue will be generated each month. In addition, various consumption taxes were originally designated for the military expenses of the national army stationed in Fujian. If the expenses of the national army are directly handled by the ministry in the future, how will they be paid? This has also become a major problem. Recently, the Department of Finance sent Secretary Director Shi Jialin and the Special Envoy's Office sent First Section Chief Zhang Zhedan to Shanghai to report to Yang Shuzhuang. Yang then sent Provincial Committee Members Zheng Baoqing and Lin Zhiyuan to Beijing with Shi and Zhang to discuss relief measures with the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that they have asked the Ministry of Finance to assist the province with 380,000 yuan per month during the transition period between the old and new taxes and to allocate 600,000 yuan at once to reimburse the advance payments of the abolished tax contracting agents. However, it is reported that the Ministry of Finance believes that after the business tax is levied in Fujian Province, it can generate about 400,000 yuan per month, and the difference is not much. It has only agreed to assist with 100,000 yuan per month. As for the one-time subsidy of 600,000 yuan, it is unable to pay due to the current financial difficulties of the national treasury and has ordered the provincial government to find its own way. Therefore, a satisfactory result has not been obtained. In addition, the salt tax surcharge in the province generates about 120,000 yuan per month, which is designated for the expenses of provincial schools. The Ministry of Finance has also decided to take it over into the national treasury from March 1st and has ordered to find other ways to make up for the educational expenses. On the 7th of this month, Education Department Director Cheng Shizhen convened a meeting with Education Expense Management Office Director Chen Peikun, Salt Commissioner Shen Qinmian, Audit Office Manager Cui Weide, and Finance Department Director He Gonggan, and decided that before the special education funds in the province are properly raised, the Salt Transport Office will temporarily invite merchants to contract the sale of upstream salt, which can generate more than 110,000 yuan per month, which will be allocated by the Audit Office to the Education Expense Management Office to maintain education.

<h3 id="e73">The Haiyuan Pavilion Library's Collection is Almost Entirely Lost <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Wang Guanjun Caused the Most Damage During His Stationing in Liaocheng</p>
<p>The Yang Family Has Already Transported the Remaining Books to Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yang family's Haiyuan Pavilion Library in Liaocheng County, Shandong (formerly Dongchang), is one of China's four most famous private book collections. The Yang family, over three generations, collected an extremely vast collection. There were no fewer than four or five hundred rare editions from the Song and Yuan dynasties, and with other scattered items, a total of more than two thousand types. This was extremely important to Chinese culture. Unfortunately, the Yang family's descendants did not know how to properly preserve them. Some were stolen and transported by troops, while others were sold to foreigners on their own. As of now, they have been almost entirely lost, causing Chinese cultural relics to flow into foreign hands. It is outrageous. This reporter recently went to Liaocheng to investigate the truth and inspect the garrison and bandit suppression situation in western Shandong. On the 11th, they departed from Jinan. After arriving in Liaocheng, they immediately went to inspect the Yang family's Haiyuan Pavilion. The Haiyuan Pavilion is located north of Guanjie Road in the county town. The buildings are very large and currently serve as the headquarters of the 87th Brigade Commander, Rong Guangxing. This reporter obtained permission from the army to enter and visit, and met with Chief of Staff Xie Yonglin. The Haiyuan Pavilion's book storage rooms totaled more than ten, but they are now completely empty, which was very unexpected. According to detailed investigation, during the Zhang Zongchang era, there was talk of nationalizing the Yang family's collection, so the descendants used cars to transport twenty-six types of rare books to Tianjin and subsequently sold them to foreigners. Last year, the bandit Guanjun entered and occupied Liaocheng, and the headquarters was set up in the Haiyuan Pavilion. This was the period of greatest destruction for the Yang family's collection. In addition to transporting a large number of books from the Yang family, Wang burned even more of them. He even used books to make fires for cooking, used books as mattresses for sleeping, used books to wipe guns and lamps when smoking opium, and used books to wipe tables and noses. He used books for everything, causing ancient books worth more than a dozen cities to be almost completely destroyed. He is truly the greatest criminal against Chinese culture. In November of last year, the 87th Brigade of the Third Route Army, led by Rong Guangxing, defeated the Wang bandits and recovered Liaocheng. In the city of Liaocheng, nine out of ten houses were empty. Not a single person was seen in the Yang residence. Books were scattered all over the yard, both inside and outside. There was no place in the toilet or stables where books were not found. The books in the yard were all soaked by heavy rain. However, inside the ten or so book storage rooms, the shelves were still full of books, but they were uneven and incomplete. The collection consisted mostly of manuscripts. Brigade Commander Rong knew that the Yang family's collection was important to Chinese culture, so Chief of Staff Xie Yonglin sent a company of soldiers to collect all the Yang family's books, regardless of whether they were complete, incomplete, or broken, and transport them into the house for safekeeping. No one was allowed to enter to view them in order to prevent further loss. Five days later, a nephew of the Yang family came to the brigade headquarters at the Haiyuan Pavilion to negotiate. He met with Xie Yonglin. This person's speech was very vulgar and he did not seem to be very literate. He said that the Commercial Press had once come to the residence to negotiate, offering 200,000 yuan to reprint part of the Haiyuan Pavilion's collection in order to preserve the secret texts, but the offer was rejected. Unexpectedly, the collection has now been ruined like this. A month later, on December 26th, the Yang family's nephew used dozens of carts to transport all the broken books to Jinan. Brigade Commander Rong also sent troops to protect the transportation, which took several days to complete. It is said that after being transported to Jinan, they were stored in the Yang family's own houses in Jianxingli, Weiyi Road. A total of six or seven large boxes were packed. The Yang family is still keeping it a secret, not wanting anyone to know. They are now building additional book storage houses in order to house the books. The person in charge of the Yang family is currently an old lady who has said to people that no matter what, she will do her best to preserve these books and not let them be lost, nor will she sell them. No matter who covets these books, she will resist with her life and not let them take a single one. As for the books sold in Tianjin, most of them were looted by the bandit army when they occupied Liaocheng. People have been sent to Tianjin to try to buy them back. It is also heard that the provincial government recently sent an order to Liaocheng, instructing Liaocheng County Magistrate Sun Tongfeng to investigate the Yang family's collection and preserve it. The old cultural power in Liaocheng is extremely strong, and it was most prosperous in the late Qing Dynasty. The county had three top scholars, one Grand Secretary, a thousand civil and military officials, and hundreds of scholars. To this day, they still adhere to ancient etiquette. The people all wear long robes, high collars, and thick white-soled shoes, like the Banner People of Beiping. Most of the women still bind their feet, and very few have unbound them. It is very difficult to instill new culture. The people hardly know what the party is. Every time a meeting is held, it is often delayed for five or six hours, or even not attended. There is the Provincial Third Normal School, the Second Middle School, and the Normal School Affiliated Elementary School, as well as two or three county-run elementary schools. The results are good, but the people of Liaocheng are ignorant and easily exploited by warlords and bandits. Xue Chuanfeng, Wang Jinfeng, and Wang Guanjun were able to cause trouble because of this.

<p>Important News</p>
<p>Bin, along with the finance bureau staff, took the opportunity to steal a portion of the grain. They claimed it was lost during the Cai bandit rebellion. When the people were busy paying their taxes, they collected the taxes for their own private gain and colluded to embezzle. The approximate amount of embezzlement was over 40,000 yuan, which was divided among Zhang, Pan, and the staff at all levels. Later, Zhang Quan was dismissed and Zheng Chengyuan succeeded him. He knew about the embezzlement and intended to report it, but he was bribed with 6,000 yuan by people in the Finance Bureau to stop. Then, Education Bureau Director Ren Shuchun, Section Chief Di Hongzhu, County Party Committee Standing Committee members Shi Taorong, and secretaries Shi Qinglian and Hu Jinghua, as well as the Fourth District Chief Zhou Shi, learned about the situation one after another and also threatened to extort money. However, as the embezzlement continued for a long time, the staff of the Finance Bureau at all levels accused each other of unfair distribution of the loot, and scandalous rumors spread everywhere. Therefore, local people Wang Pingling and Zhou Bisheng filed a complaint with the provincial government. The provincial government detained Zheng Chengyuan and thirteen others for questioning and transferred them to the Zhenjiang Court for handling. The Procuratorate of the court found the investigation to be true and prosecuted them separately as follows: (1) For the land tax embezzlement part, the defendants were Zhang Quan, Pan Bin, Huang Xing'an, Shen Zhiqin, Zou Hanliang, Cheng Linshen, Zhou Ganqing, Chen Ronglin, Cao Qingzhi, Lu Zhiwen, Zhao Dianhua, etc., eleven people. (2) For the part of accepting bribes, Zheng Chengyuan. (3) For the part of extortion, Ren Shuchun, Di Hongxun, Shi Taorong, Shi Qinglian, Hu Jinghua, Zhou Shi, etc., six people.</p>
<p>The case was publicly tried yesterday (14th) starting at 10:00 AM. The plaintiffs who were summoned arrived, and the witnesses were Wang Pingling (Zhou Bisheng had a long-distance phone call to Zhen saying that he could not come to Zhen due to the river being frozen), Song Guangqian, Wu Jiabin, and Shi Guiguan. The defendants Zheng Chengyuan, Pan Bin, Huang Xing'an, Shen Zhiqin, Cao Qingzhi, Lu Zhiwen, Shi Taorong, Shi Qinglian, Hu Jinghua, Ren Shuchun, Di Hongxun, Zhou Shi, Zhao Dianhua, etc., a total of seventeen people. Judge Yang Changdi, together with two assessors Zhong Shicheng and Zhou Baochu, Prosecutor Yan Changtao, and Clerk Wu Zutai, ascended to the first criminal court. The defense lawyers who attended were Chen Liren representing Zheng Chengyuan, Jiang Shijie representing Pan Bin, Tao Rong representing Shen Zhiqin, and Zhu Fengen representing Cao Qingzhi, four people. However, because there were so many people who were summoned for questioning, the trial began at 10:00 AM and only finished at about 3:00 AM this morning (15th). The length of time spent set a new record for trials in the Zhenjiang court. The results of the trial were that Zhou Shi, Lu Zhiwen, and Zhao Dianhua were ordered to hand over the original guarantee, and Zheng Chengyuan, Di Hongxun, Ren Shuchun, etc., were ordered to pay additional cash bail. Because they were temporarily unable to afford it, they were ordered to be detained together with Pan Bin and others. Judge Yang announced that the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 21st of this month. (15th)</p>

<p>Robbery and kidnapping cases at the end of the year and the beginning of the year: The southern part of this county has long been occupied by bandits. Recently, they have gathered more and more people, and their momentum is even more rampant. The recent kidnapping cases are summarized as follows: (1) In the Taojiaku area northeast of Langxia, the son of Tao Heshang, who is studying at a certain elementary school in the town, usually goes out early and returns late. Unexpectedly, on the way home after school the other day, he was kidnapped by the bandit Yang Meimei. Later, he was redeemed for 500 yuan. (2) Jin Sheng, the son of Luo Amao, north of Dashiqiao, was kidnapped by the bandit Xu Ximing (also known as tailor A Jin) the other day. The ransom demanded was very high. Because his family had no money to redeem him, he is still in the bandit's den. (3) Shen Huoquan, a farmer in the Nanmoku area north of Wanchun Bridge, was also kidnapped by the bandit Yang Meimei the other day. There has been no news of him so far. (4) The family of Gao Chuansheng, a farmer in the Luhetan area north of Zhangyan, had already been extorted by bandits several times. Unexpectedly, on the night of December 30th, many armed bandits came again, led by the bandit leader Xu Ximing. They first robbed and then kidnapped his four-month-old son, hiding him in the home of a bandit named Xiao in the Chianxu southeast Chang'an area. Later, Qiu Awu was asked to negotiate, and finally he was redeemed for 1,040 yuan. (5) Yang Zhaohe's family in the Cao'an area southeast of Baziqiao received a threatening letter from the bandits on December 29th, demanding a bandit payment of 1,000 yuan. Zhaohe ignored it. Unexpectedly, on January 1st, several bandits came again and took Zhaohe's wife away. Later, people were asked to intercede, and finally she was redeemed for 100 yuan. (6) On the evening of January 5th, more than twenty bandits suddenly came to several houses in the Kongjiaque northwest Danzhu area, including Zhu Wuxiang and Zhu Ruizhi. They robbed people in the house. Wuxiang's wife, who was 67 years old, was shot in a vital part by the bandits and died. They also wanted to kidnap Wuxiang's son Dajie, but fortunately he had crossed the river to escape. However, Ruizhi's son was unable to escape and was tied up by the bandits. Later, his servant escaped and sounded the alarm. He was released halfway. When the Kongjiaque Security Corps heard the alarm and pursued, the bandits had already fled.</p>

<p>A Steamer Disaster in Chuannan Due to Carelessness: The Chuannan scheduled steamer was about to leave Zhugiao Town yesterday when it was heading to Chuansha. Because the water pipe was frozen and could not be started, the mechanic poured cold water to heat it up to unfreeze it. Unexpectedly, due to carelessness, a fire broke out immediately. Although they tried their best to put out the fire, the fire was very fierce, causing most of the ship's top and cabin to be burned down. Fortunately, all the passengers were safe.</p>
<p>Too Light a Punishment for the Death of an Athlete: At the end of last year, the county government received a letter from the Shanghai Education Bureau, stating that Yu Zhenhua, a student of Tonghui Elementary School, had been borrowed by Zhoupu Elementary School to participate in the Nanhui County Elementary and Secondary School Games. Due to continuous strenuous exercise, he contracted an illness and died. After investigation, it was found to be true. In addition to severely punishing Tonghui Elementary School as a warning, they requested that the principals and teachers of the Zhoupu Elementary School be severely punished. The county government then transferred the order to the Education Bureau for follow-up. According to the bureau's report, it was decided to suspend the physical education teacher Cai Fei's teaching qualification for two years. The county government considered the punishment to be too light and specially instructed the bureau yesterday to discuss a stricter punishment in order to set an example.</p>

<p>Detailed Record of the Bandit Police Incident in Wu Jiaqiao: More than one hundred bandits suddenly came to Wu Jiaqiao in the northern part of this county at about 3:00 AM on the night of the 5th of this month. They were wearing military uniforms and plain clothes, and about half of them were armed with fear guns, short guns, and hand grenades. They suddenly surrounded the police team stationed there and set fire to it. The policemen bravely rushed out and repelled the bandits. It is reported that the bandits also went to the homes of farmers such as Zhu Buqing that night, looting and burning. Wu Jiaqiao Township Chief Wang Bingsheng urgently sent someone to the city to report. The county government immediately ordered the police team leader Sun Longxun to transfer the entire team of cavalry and infantry to rush to suppress them, and also consulted with the Danyang Gendarmerie Company to send a team to join the suppression. When the county police team rushed to Guolonggang, about two miles away from Wu Jiaqiao, the bandits had not yet retreated. The police team immediately advanced and attacked. After about an hour, the bandits could not resist and began to retreat to the north. At that time, the gendarmerie also arrived, and the gendarmerie defended the rear, and the police team led the troops to pursue to the foot of the mountain north of Wu Jiaqiao. The bandits dispersed into the mountains to the northeast. This time, the third class of the second team of the police team originally stationed in Wu Jiaqiao was surrounded by bandits. Due to the small number of police and the large number of bandits, they were outnumbered. The injured included squad leader Yao Hongbin, deputy squad leader Xu Chuntang, policemen Cao Zuofa, Huang Ruiqing, and cook Yong Dengwu. Another policeman, Li Shouzheng, was seriously injured and burned to death when the bandits set fire to the station. It was also heard that the police team had captured three bandits, Xu Fuyin, Jiang Laoda, and Zou Qiaolin, while pursuing them in the countryside, and they are currently being interrogated.</p>

<p>The Progress of Resolving Sun Jingtai's Troops: Since Sun Jingtai's troops were reorganized into the New Twenty-Seventh Division, they have often engaged in illegal activities in the Shuyang area of northern Jiangsu. Zhang Zhijiang, the Pacification Supervisor of Jiangsu, has received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, ordering that the troops be resolved as soon as possible. The Governor's Office received a telegram from Chief Commander Liang Yuan yesterday morning (13th), reporting on the progress of resolving Sun's troops. The outline is as follows: (1) All departments followed the order and reached the designated locations on the day of the document, but when I approached Shuyang, the bandits had already detected it in advance and withdrew from the city, preparing to resist. Later, seeing the strength of my army, they rushed out of the encirclement in the northeast direction. They were severely attacked by the Liu and Wang brigades, and the bandits fled in all directions. A total of three regiments were resolved, many bandits were killed, more than 300 were captured, more than 100 guns, one mountain gun, two mortars, more than 100 horses, one bandit battalion commander Diao Damin, two battalion commanders, and the entire repair shop were captured. Sun led the remnants and fled to Fangshan Street. (2) The other departments all had captures and are currently being cleared. (3) Most of the bandits are hiding in the city and scattered in the countryside. Liu, the brigade commander, has been appointed as the city defense commander to conduct a thorough search. The brigade is stationed near the city. (4) Sun Fengxiang, the brigade commander of the First Cavalry Division, was ordered to lead the team through Rouxu, Fangshan, and Yangfu Street, and Wu Tianbin, the deputy division commander of the Third Cavalry Division, was ordered to lead the team through Houzhentou, all to pursue in the direction of the Longhai Railway. They were all limited to passing through the railway and informed the Jin and Han division commanders to send teams to intercept.

<p>Planned Organization of Post-Abolition Municipal Affairs Group: Ningbo City has been ordered to be abolished by the provincial government and is about to end. Citizens Fan Chunjin, Wang Lijia, and others from the urban area believe that since the municipal government has been abolished, municipal construction will be suspended with great difficulty. Although the province has resolved to hand over management to the Yin County Magistrate, they fear that he may not be able to handle it adequately. Therefore, they plan to organize a municipal affairs post-abolition group in advance to handle municipal affairs after the official abolition of the municipal government. The method is to first gather fair and just gentry in the city to send a telegram to the province stating the reasons for the organization. This organization is currently under negotiation and is expected to become a reality soon.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Cases in Eastern and Western Yin County: At the Wan Shun Rice Store in Miao Jiaqiao, eastern Yin County, around 12 o'clock the night before, seven or eight robbers suddenly broke into the store, each wielding sharp weapons. They injured Chen Azeng, the store's business manager, in the head, resulting in an estimated loss of over one hundred yuan. Also, Chen Meidi, a resident of Qiaotou, Yuanzhen Bridge in western Yin County, is only sixteen years old and already married. He has a seventy-year-old grandmother and wife, totaling four family members. Meidi is currently studying at the people's night school run by Yuanzhen Bridge Primary School. Unexpectedly, around 9 o'clock the night before, when he returned home after school and was knocking on the door, he was suddenly kidnapped by robbers who had been lying in wait outside the door. By the time his grandmother opened the door, Meidi was gone. The next day, the robbers sent a letter demanding 5,000 yuan for ransom. It is said that Meidi's family only has a meager twenty-odd acres of land, and even if they sold everything they own, they would not be able to raise 5,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Investigation by the Construction Bureau Regarding the Nanting River Project: After Zhuang Tianmei, Xu Yizhou, and others filed a complaint regarding the Nanting River project's financial report, the county government, together with the Construction Bureau, conducted an investigation. Due to their lax supervision, the two directors, one in the east and one in the west, were each given a major demerit on record. Now, Zhuang and others believe that the county's handling is too lenient, so they have sent representatives to the province to petition, and have extracted various clauses from the River Project Review Committee as evidence of corruption. Because the Construction Bureau believes that the case has been causing disturbances for a long time, they summoned Zhou Jiuxu, the director of the Construction Bureau, the day before yesterday for questioning. The day before yesterday, they also ordered the county to summon the former directors of the eastern and western river projects, namely Jiang Rongchu and Zhang Fengtai, the chiefs of the first and eighth districts, to the province for verification. The bureau also dispatched a special commissioner yesterday to Fengxian to retrieve various contract documents and other items related to the river project, stating that they would be handed over to an accountant for item-by-item review in order to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Difficulties in the Transfer of Funds and Property of Charitable Halls: Although the old and new preparatory committees of the local Relief Institute have already completed the handover, the funds and property of various charitable halls that should be taken over have not been fully received. The new preparatory committee discussed this issue the other day and decided to issue a warning first. If they still refuse to comply, the county will enforce the law to clear the matter up. However, it is now known that the charitable halls believe that there are no provisions in the ministry's orders regarding changes or reorganizations of the original charitable funds and property, so most advocate maintaining the status quo, leading to disputes and each side sticking to its own position, making it unlikely that the issue will be resolved in a short period of time. Unauthorized Decapitation Results in Major Demerit from the Provincial Government: The Ministry of Civil Affairs has given Yang Xingsheng, the captain of the second police squad of the county, a major demerit because on December 3rd of last year, he killed the bandit Xiao Gang at the home of Cao Qinghe in Niuqiao Township, and then, without following regulations, arbitrarily decapitated and displayed the head. The ministry considered this a violation of law and discipline, so it issued a major demerit and reprimanded him the day before yesterday. As for the key suspect, Tang Yixin, who was captured by the squad for burning and looting in Zhuanghang, he is still being detained in the county jail pending verification, as the province has not yet sent a reply to the county.</p>

The original submission stated: "The National Education Reform Plan resolved at the Second National Education Conference was submitted to your esteemed Yuan in June of last year for forwarding to the National Government, and the department has also submitted it to the Central Political Conference for review. Currently, this plan has not yet been approved and promulgated, and all the department's measures for improving national education are pending this basis.

<p>Chairman's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Chairman Liu Weichi said in his opening remarks: "Today marks the first day of the Two-Route Business Conference. We are honored by the presence of representatives and experts from all quarters, which demonstrates their deep concern for our railway. I am immensely grateful. I would like to take this opportunity to present my humble views as follows: (1) Report on the purpose of the meeting. Railway construction, whether regarding military, political, or economic affairs, must primarily focus on developing industry and commerce and facilitating transportation. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways connect the capital in the north, reaching Tianjin and Hebei, and extend to Zhejiang Province, converging in Shanghai, a major world commercial port. In accordance with the economic principles of railway construction, it is strategically located in a vital position. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Railways, it has prioritized the development of the national railway industry, especially focusing on organizing existing routes as a matter of urgency. The business of each route varies depending on its location, with some focusing on freight transport and others on passenger transport. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways derive 60-70% of their revenue from passenger transport and 30-40% from freight transport. However, Shanghai is a major commercial hub, and the areas along the railway lines are densely populated. Apart from minerals, various industrial and commercial activities are also highly developed. In terms of transportation, there should be significant development potential. It is essential that industry and commerce collaborate with our railway to research suitable methods, thereby enabling thorough development and achieving mutually beneficial effects. (2) The relationship between railways and industry and commerce. In recent years, with scientific progress, transportation methods have been continuously improved. In terms of transport, besides railways, there are also shipping and air transport. However, shipping is slow, and air transport cannot carry heavy loads. For long-distance transport of heavy goods with speed, land-based railways are the most stable and convenient option. Therefore, railways are universally recognized as a crucial element in the transportation sector. The areas reached by railways are inherently related to cultural development. Industrial manufactures, commercial trade goods, as well as agricultural and mineral products, all rely on them for exchange and transportation, balancing surpluses and deficits. In remote areas where railways have not yet been built, roads can be constructed first to provide support due to economic considerations. From this perspective, the relationship between railways and the industrial and commercial sectors is deep and cannot be compared to other forms of shipping or air transport. However, railways are a public utility and have a responsibility to support the development of industry and commerce. The areas through which the two railways pass face competition from waterways, making the situation quite different. Therefore, the level of freight rates and the convenience of transportation should be improved as much as possible within the feasible range to suit the environment. Representatives from all areas share this intention. (3) The past history of the two railways. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway currently has a main line and branch lines totaling over 326 kilometers in length. It began with the construction of the Songhu Railway, dating back to the second year of Emperor Guangxu's reign during the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, the court and officials did not understand global trends, so it was built and then dismantled. It was not until the twenty-second year of Guangxu's reign that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was rebuilt. A loan agreement was signed with a British company for a construction fee of 2.9 million pounds, which was a severe constraint. In terms of personnel, important positions were mostly held by foreigners. In terms of business, materials had to be purchased from Britain, and one-fifth of the annual surplus had to be distributed to the British bank as a profit share. Foreigners also served as general managers. After the founding of the Republic of China, the loan agreement was amended once. It was not until the establishment of the Ministry of Railways that the authority over personnel matters was gradually recovered. The loan is being repaid over 25 years, starting last year. Although this year's income is not deficient, financial difficulties are exceptionally challenging due to gold prices. Fortunately, unification has been achieved, and the overall situation is secure, with unlimited potential for business development. It is hoped that future increases in income will allow the railway to be fully recovered early to protect national rights. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway currently has a main line and branch lines totaling over 273 kilometers in length. It was originally funded and built by local people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It was not until the early years of the Republic of China that the government borrowed 1.5 million pounds in British debt and nationalized it, connecting it with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. As a result, it was also bound by the loan agreement, preventing active improvements. The business of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section relies entirely on passenger transport, especially tourists visiting West Lake. In recent years, there has been a slight profit. The Caoe section is barely maintaining the status quo and offers little hope until the entire line is completed. The debts of this route have been gradually repaid, with only 600,000 pounds remaining, and it will soon be free from foreign control. (4) Recent improvements and future development plans for the two routes. After the establishment of the Ministry of Railways, it recognized the past failures of the two routes and adhered to the late Premier's industrial development plan for railway construction. It was determined to rectify the two routes. In the most recent year, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway constructed several sidings, replaced sleepers along the route, built a new station in Xiaguan and the Baoxing Road station, expanded the Shanghai North Station, extended platforms along the route, added platform roofs, and improved sanitation and car services, spending approximately over 2.2 million yuan. Eight Pacific-type locomotives were purchased, two locomotives were transferred from the Jiaoji Railway, and two locomotives were leased. Two passenger train sets and 100 forty-ton freight cars were purchased, totaling approximately over 3 million yuan. These were purchased by the Sino-British company and paid in installments. The total expenditure was approximately over 5 million yuan, all for significant construction projects. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway also added several sidings and purchased two new freight locomotives from the Jiaoji Railway. In addition, all equipment is being gradually improved. With the current high gold prices, all principal and interest payments for the two routes, as well as payments for materials, are made in gold pounds. Other expenses and salaries are also increasing daily. Operating income is in danger of being unable to sustain itself. Only because I, as your brother, have complied with the Ministry of Railways' intention to rectify railway administration, regardless of financial difficulties, do I not allow the slightest懈怠 in organizing railway administration to ensure future development. As for future development plans, I can report that (1) The Nanjing Jiangbian Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Pukou Station of the Jinpu Railway are separated by the river, making it extremely inconvenient to communicate and transfer goods. Therefore, it is essential to build a cross-river ferry, which is currently being handled by the Ministry and is expected to be completed in about a year. (2) The Wusong Wharf of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is a hub for both Chinese and foreign water and land transportation. However, the waterways there are shallow and unsuitable for berthing, making it necessary to find ways to rebuild and add warehouses for loading and unloading goods. This requires approximately 5 million yuan, which is already being planned. (3) The business between Shanghai and Suzhou on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is booming, and the traffic is congested, often causing delays due to waiting for trains. It is planned to build a change of track as the initial step towards a double track for the entire line. (4) Although the vehicles on the two routes have been adequately supplemented, there are still too few locomotives. It is planned to purchase an additional 20 locomotives to avoid merchants having no cars to transport goods. (5) After the Shanghai-Hangzhou line was built, the middle section, from Caoe to Xixing, approximately 70 kilometers, has not yet been completed, which is quite regrettable. From a business perspective, there is no urgent need for construction. But for the sake of transportation convenience, the Ministry of Railways is eager to find ways to complete it as soon as possible. Moreover, a portion of the roadbed from Caoe to Shaoxing has already been built. In the current situation, the estimated cost is no less than 6 million yuan. If some of the Russian loans can be allocated for this purpose, construction can begin. (6) The general situation of the two routes has been described above. From now on, the only hope is that our railways can cooperate with businesses to seek mutual benefits. The railway can achieve increasing business revenue, and commerce can also achieve development. This is the most alarming method. However, railways have recently been affected by gold prices, leading to significant financial difficulties. The freight rates and ticket prices currently collected by the two routes are lower than any other route. Not only is the cost not covered, but even operating expenses may not be sufficient to maintain. This is cause for concern. As your brother, I have followed the Ministry of Railways' intention to rectify railway administration. No matter how difficult the financial situation, there can be no slight懈怠 in organizing railway administration in order to achieve future development. As for any obstacles in commercial transportation, the railway is willing to find ways to eliminate them to the best of its ability. I hope that the representatives present will enlighten us."</p>
<p>Instructions from the Representative of the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Vice Minister Huang Hanliang of the Ministry of Railways delivered instructions, saying, "Railways are inherently a type of business enterprise, as everyone knows. However, in my opinion, the business of railways is special and different from ordinary commerce. Why is that? Because ordinary commerce can disregard other businesses besides their own. But the business of railways is not like that. It relies entirely on the industries and commerce along the route. If agriculture, industry, and commerce can thrive in all areas, then its business will naturally develop along with them. Therefore, there is a close relationship between railways and the industries and commerce in various areas. The railways fulfill their responsibility to assist the development of industries and commerce in various areas, and that is how they seek the development of their own business. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways run through Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, passing through densely populated areas that are rich in products. Moreover, they directly reach the capital on one side and connect to our country's largest commercial port on the other. Therefore, their position is very important. The Ministry also pays very close attention to them. In the past, due to the war, although the two railways did not suffer any direct losses, they were indirectly affected to a considerable extent. During the military period, there were indeed things that the Ministry could not do to organize the two railways. Now that the war has ended, organizing the various issues of the two routes is truly the most important thing at present. Therefore, the Ministry has ordered the authorities of the two routes to organize this conference and invited all of you present to join. Among you, some are transportation experts, some have rich experience in transportation, and some are very familiar with the situation in various areas. You will certainly have many insights on various issues of the two routes. Please do not be shy and feel free to express your opinions. What needs to be improved, what needs to be organized, what needs to be expanded, and what needs to be equipped. Please bring up these points at any time. The authorities of the two routes will certainly adopt them as much as possible and implement them wherever possible. They must enable these two routes to fulfill their inherent responsibilities, assist the development of industries and commerce, and facilitate the transportation of merchants and travelers. This is the purpose of this conference, and it is also the Ministry's hope for this consensus."</p>
<p>Speech by the Representative of the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, representing the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said, "Although railways are a state-owned enterprise, their main business is indeed the transportation of goods, which is most closely related to merchants. Everything must be based on facilitating the transportation of goods as a prerequisite, so that the railway business can advance rapidly and reach its full potential day by day. Therefore, the interests of the railway and the interests of the merchants should be regarded as closely intertwined, and should not be viewed as two separate entities. The fact that the two routes have convened this business conference today is truly a wise policy and a sign of innovation on the part of the authorities. All merchants should do their utmost to support it in order to realize the purpose of the conference. In recent years, all the national railways, such as the Pinghan, Pingsui, and Pingpu, have been under military control from time to time. Although the current Ministry of Railways has vigorously implemented a unified policy and repeatedly demanded the return of detained vehicles, they have not yet been fully returned today. The lack of vehicles is still extremely serious, and the difficulties faced by the transportation of goods can be imagined. Because the two routes are located in areas close to the capital, the order has been well-maintained for the past two or three years. Although there has been occasional military transport, there has never been a case of car detention. Moreover, the Pinghan and Pingsui routes have established railway cargo donation bureaus along the way due to military fundraising, with multiple layers of regulations and numerous items, which is the biggest obstacle to the transportation of commercial goods. Fortunately, the two routes do not have this phenomenon. All of these are advantages of the two routes that other routes cannot match. Therefore, the authorities of the two routes want to implement policies that benefit merchants, which is more likely to achieve twice the result with half the effort compared to other routes. The purpose of today's conference convened by the authorities of the two routes is nothing more than to have merchants share their grievances and benefits with the authorities, who will humbly accept them as preparation for implementing policies that benefit merchants. Those present today include representatives from the general chambers of commerce along the route. As for this city, there are also representatives from various trade guilds. I am attending as a representative of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Chamber of Commerce is the representative of various industries. Therefore, the opinions of the representatives of various industries are the opinions of the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce. Among the various industries present today, such as the Flour Mill Trade Association and the Transportation Trade Association, have already expressed their opinions. I will only reiterate two of the most common and important requests among the opinions that have already been raised by various industries: (1) Reduce freight rates. If railway freight rates are properly applied, they can achieve the same effect as tariffs. On the one hand, they can promote domestic products and resist imported goods. On the other hand, they can gradually change waterway transportation to land transportation, and the monopoly of foreign powers on our country's river and sea navigation can be undermined in an invisible way. However, the freight rates set by the railways recently do not seem to take this point into account. For example, the Flour Mill Trade Association has stated that the railway freight rates for wheat flour and wheat are more expensive than waterway transportation. For example, the Petroleum Trade Association has stated that the railways charge Standard Oil and Asiatic Petroleum Company 30% less for transporting oil, while Chinese-run oil companies cannot enjoy the same benefits. This is an issue that urgently needs to be reformed. Moreover, the terrain where the two routes are located is different from other routes. Jiangsu and Zhejiang have always been known as water towns, and small boats and sailboats travel everywhere. Water transport is cheap and does not cause damage. As the Transportation Trade Association stated in its proposal this time, "In the past, passenger and freight traffic in Wuxi and Changzhou was transported by railway. In recent years, large quantities of rice, wheat, grain, cotton yarn, cloth, silk cocoons, sugar, and groceries have mostly been transported by small boats or civilian boats, which is caused by the railway bureau's repeated increases in freight rates." Therefore, it is more necessary for the two routes to reduce freight rates than other routes. It is proposed that the reduction of freight rates be first approved by this conference. On the one hand, the Railway Bureau should establish a freight rate reduction investigation committee to investigate and list the waterway freight rates and car transport prices of various goods one by one. After comparing the two, the freight rates should be reduced appropriately to attract more business. In addition, the Beining Railway held a business conference in the previous year where officials and merchants met with sincerity. The resolutions were mostly implemented, and the result of reducing freight rates greatly increased freight traffic, which has been deeply affected the South Manchuria Railway, which is enough to serve as a good precedent for the two routes today. The authorities of the two routes will certainly not allow the Beining Railway to have all the credit. (2) Be responsible for transportation. The key to the prosperity of freight transport is nothing more than the following three points: first, cheap fees; second, speed; and third, safety. All three points must be taken into account, and then freight transport will flock to it. To ensure the safety of freight transport, first of all, the Railway Bureau must be responsible for guaranteeing the goods during transportation. After the goods have been handed over to the Railway Bureau for transport, they are beyond the control of the lender. If there is a shortage or other issues, the Railway Bureau is naturally responsible for compensation. Similarly, the shipping bureau is also responsible for waterway transport of goods. Car transport and shipping are the same. How can it be uniquely different for state-owned enterprises? However, Article 8 of the General Rules for Transportation stipulates that "For goods delivered for transportation that have not been specifically declared, the Railway is responsible for them, otherwise, the cargo owner shall be responsible. The railway is not responsible for any losses of goods, regardless of the reason, after they have been accepted by the railway." With this regulation, goods are often stolen or shorted, and the cargo owner has no way to sue. If the cargo owner is made specifically responsible by the railway then the cost is one-tenth over the freight charge. After a considerable amount of freight has been collected for transporting goods, according to Article 641 of the Civil Code, "The carrier should exercise the necessary care and attention to protect the interests of the owner of the transported goods. If the carrier fails to exercise the aforementioned care and attention, he shall be liable for the damage caused thereby." Responsibility is the carrier's natural obligation. It is inappropriate to charge a so-called responsible freight rate in addition to the prescribed freight rate. Because the freight rates of the two routes are already more expensive than water transport, charging an additional 10% responsible freight rate is a greater burden for merchants. If they do not bear this fee, they can only watch their goods being shortened or lost without being able to obtain compensation. This is why large quantities of goods are willing to switch to waterway transportation. For the sake of the railway's business, this is not a good plan. The letter from the Flour Mill Trade Association also deeply feels the pain of this matter. It is proposed that the authorities of the two routes delete this responsible freight rate clause in the Transportation Rules and change it to "Once the goods are handed over by the cargo owner to the railway for transport, the Railway Bureau shall be responsible for them before delivery, and shall exercise the necessary care and attention at all times. If the car guards, et cetera, and their supervisors fail to exercise the aforementioned care and attention and there are losses, the Railway Bureau shall be liable for compensation." Then the cargo owner will be protected, and bank mortgages can be safely accepted, which will be convenient for merchants and beneficial to the railway business. In addition, there are extremely detailed opinions on what should be promoted and what should be reformed in various industries, which will be presented separately, and I will not repeat them to waste the precious time of the meeting. However, there is one last word that must be declared. It is hoped that the railway bureau will not regard the proposals submitted by the various chambers of commerce and trade guilds this time as demands for merchants to increase their own interests, but as plans to assist the railway bureau in increasing its business. If we can understand each other's interests and stand on the same line, then the various proposals put forward at this meeting will naturally achieve good results. The bureau will not have convened this meeting in vain, and the representatives will be able to complete their tasks. How fortunate it would be to promote national interests and people's welfare together! I offer this as a toast to today's meeting."</p>
<p>Speeches by Representatives of the Two Cities</p>
<p>(1) Pan Gongzhan, representing Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, said, "Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the position of the two routes has become even more important. The past history of the two routes over the past two or three decades has been unable to fully develop due to the instability of the situation. Now, the two routes have invited representatives from the business community and transportation experts to jointly discuss and adopt the opinions of the business community to plan for the prosperity of the two routes, which is truly a matter of urgency. From the perspective of the Shanghai Municipal Government, we hope that this conference will have a successful outcome. It is believed that the prosperity of commercial transport on the two routes is the key to the prosperity of Shanghai. As China's gateway and the largest commercial port, foreign goods coming to China must first arrive in Shanghai and then be transported into the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. If commercial transport is developed, exports will increase, and agricultural, industrial, and commercial production will also increase accordingly. Shanghai will also prosper as a result. The development of Shanghai's municipal administration and the development of commercial transport are indeed directly proportional. What we hope for at this time is: First, those in charge of commercial transport on the two routes should pay attention to the freight situation on the two routes and investigate the goods produced in various places along the route. If there are any that have not been transported by rail, they should try to absorb them, so that the inconveniences, high freight rates, lack of vehicles, and incomplete equipment that merchants felt in the past can be improved one by one, making commercial transport convenient, various industries can develop accordingly, and production can increase, expanding the market. Second, the Railway Bureau should assist in agricultural publicity in the future, such as opening agricultural special cars for mobile exhibitions, etc., the influence of which is profound. Third, the railway station problem. Although this may not be possible for this conference to resolve, the opinions of the Shanghai Municipal Government should also be contributed to the railway authorities and the business community. The establishment of the sea terminal and the current location of the North Station are both outside the boundary road, in the concession. The history of the concession has been unchanged for decades. As a result, the hub of water and land transport has a great relationship with the concession, which is most convenient for the concession. It is most incomprehensible that the businesses run by the Chinese are accommodating the concession. In order to realize the Greater Shanghai Plan, the Shanghai Municipal Government should work with the Ministry of Railways, the business community, and the municipal government to change the overall traffic policy of the city. The most important thing is to rebuild the main station and relocate it to Zhenru. One end of the track can reach Wusong directly through Jiangwan. A commercial port can be opened in Wusong, so that commercial ships coming to Shanghai do not have to open to Pukou, but can load and unload in Wusong. Inland cargo ships can also reach Wusong directly and export. This is still extremely convenient for Shanghai traffic. In addition, in order to maintain the Jing'an Market district, a branch station can be set up at the original site of the North Station, and a floating bridge across the river can be built. Branch roads can reach Pudong directly to revitalize the Pudong market and avoid providing convenience only to the concession. This requires the joint cooperation of the authorities and the business community. The prosperity of Shanghai is the key, and it is also related to the prosperity of the whole country. In short, commercial transport on the two routes is the biggest key. It is hoped that the representatives and experts will take these contributed opinions as a reference and study them together, so that this conference will have a successful outcome and commercial transport will develop day by day." (2) Liang Junren, representing Nanjing Mayor Wei Daoming, said, "This conference is to gather representatives from the commercial firms, banks, transport companies and relevant agencies of the railway line, to discuss and thoroughly improve the cargo transport method, so as to cooperate and benefit each other. It is expected that there will be very smooth results. Our municipal government expressed its sympathy. Junren is in accordance with the Mayor's will, should contribute a few words to the Nanjing Municipal Government, as a eulogy. Nanjing was once the capital of the previous dynasties, quite prosperous, and to the defeat of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Qing dynasty in order to eliminate the capital of the ruins, at the expense of various destruction, and then make the scenic area into a depressed area, full of desolation, completely lost the urban beauty of the realm, Now our party and the country were built here, and all the construction is very much, and all need to be done from scratch, design and implement. Our municipal government is bound to cooperate, which can be a help to the prosperity of the capital, the Beijing-Shanghai Shanghai Hangzhou Ningbo railway and other transportation agencies only. Shanghai's status is in the first place in China's national industrial and commercial concentration area, from Shanghai to Beijing, although there is a frightening river waterway traffic, but the most convenient as Beijing Shanghai one road, all the needs of the capital construction, all rely on Shanghai's supply, and this all the supply, only the Beijing Shanghai railway for the most substantive transport is the capital of the prosperity indirectly and directly, are closely related to the Beijing Shanghai road, so the Beijing Shanghai road transport more convenient, the capital of the prosperity more easy, the capital more prosperous, the Beijing Shanghai road transport is also more, the transport more, the road bureau revenue also increases. Then for the present plan, any order must be to help the prosperity of the capital as the goal, can not be said, therefore, today for cargo transport, especially the transport of Beijing of various goods procedures, to strive for convenience, freight to strive to reduce, this small profit and more transport principle, the result, help the prosperity of the capital, and the railway itself, is actually far-reaching interests, its meaning is obvious, and no continuation of the statement. In addition, there is a small railway section in Nanjing city, which is from Xiaguan to Zhongzheng Street in the city. The distance is only more than 20 miles, but it is actually an important tool for traffic inside and outside Beijing, and in fact it is also connected to the Beijing-Shanghai road. The scope of the road should be planned and improved by Junren, actively carried out, and there is also a need to consult with the road to help each end, another opinion will be submitted for discussion. This meeting, I hope the road bureau and all those present, each with a long-term vision, sent to the Hongmo Biwei, a very good contribution, the future of the capital of the prosperity, the progress of the business, the development of the road transport, are favorable, and this for praise."</p>
<p>Summary of Guest Speeches</p>
<p>(1) Expert Dai Linshu said briefly: "I am very honored to be invited to participate. Today, we are opening this meeting. All of us in the business, industrial, banking, and industry circles can meet with the railway authorities to discuss openly, which is truly the first gospel for the people along the two routes. I cannot but sincerely celebrate the success of this meeting. Therefore, I am very willing to take this first day of the meeting to say a few words to contribute to you all, and please give me your advice. I have seen the proposals from all walks of life, which are nothing more than three: (1) improvement of station services, (2) appropriate reduction of freight rates, and (3) allocation of vehicles. These are truly the most important proposals, and they are also what the railway authorities are working hard to pay attention to. I have two hopes: (1) For the railway authorities, A. Railways are public undertakings and should bear a corresponding responsibility to the public. B. Railways are established to strengthen national defense, develop commerce and industry, and facilitate people's livelihood, and cannot be based on profits and losses. (2) For colleagues from all walks of life, A. The railway should be regarded as their own business and should not give up attention. B. Any imperfections should be suggested or even attacked as much as possible. C. Cite the development of American railways and how the people pay attention to it. D. Any suggestions or requests must be legal and reasonable, and should be promoted within the railway's environment and scope." (2) Tang Jianzhong, Second Section Chief of the Jiangsu Construction Department, said briefly: "The key to developing commercial transport lies in reducing freight rates, improving management, and saving cargo transportation time. Since the recovery of the provincial capital's concession, the market has changed greatly. The rising tide and sand beaches by the river are a great obstacle to ships berthing. The provincial government plans to move the wharf to the east or west of Beigushan. As a result, the river station cannot load and unload cargo smoothly. It is proposed to extend it to the Zhenjiang Customs. It is proposed to submit it when the Ministry of Railways convenes a railway conference for reference." (3) Feng Yunshu, representative of the Transport Association. (4) Yan Luona, representative of the Two-Route Party Headquarters, expressed many hopes for the conference.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Remarks from the Two-Route Party Headquarters</p>
<p>To all the representatives of the Two-Route Business Conference: The assembly is now convened and the four sides are well-regarded. Expanding land transport is a model and compass, patching up the loopholes to enrich the people's livelihood, and connecting Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, and Anhui is an enterprise. The sound of the cry is heroic, and the progress is made every day. With this blessing, I would like to express my congratulations. Respectfully submitted by Min Luobing, Standing Committee Member of the Executive Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party's Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways.</p>

<p>That Jiangwan, so strong, actually lost to the Pirates, and by a mere one point, is truly lamentable. In the first half, Jiangwan had a very favorable position, winning 19 to 16.

With poor luck, Touren scored again, and Jiangwan lost by a single point, 35 to 36. The entire stadium was filled with regret.</p>

<h3 id="e105">The Two-Route Business Conference Officially Opened Yesterday <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>First General Assembly This Morning</p>
<p>Liu Weizhi, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, managing the affairs of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, specially convened representatives from the business community along the routes and transportation experts to hold a business conference to improve transportation methods on the two routes and promote railway administration. The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM yesterday morning at the Jiande Hall on Fusheng Road, Zhabei. Mr. Liu and Directors Liu Chengchang, Zheng Baozhao, and Luo Panhui all personally attended to receive guests. It was decided that the general assembly would be held this morning to begin discussing the various proposals. The grand occasion of yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Tea Party of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the Afternoon <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the Chamber's standing committee room to entertain the representatives of the Two-Route Business Conference. Over a hundred people attended, including Liu Weizhi, Zheng Baozhao, Hua Zejun, Wang Yansong, Zhu Wenqi, and representatives from various chambers of commerce along the two routes. Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcome speech, followed by speeches from Liu Weizhi and Zheng Baozhao, and then representatives from various industries expressed their opinions. The event ended at 6:00 PM. The various speeches are recorded below.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech by the Chairman Today, representatives of the Railway Bureau, various chambers of commerce, various trade associations, and various experts have responded to the call of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Business Conference and have come to Shanghai. Our Chamber, as the host, and because the business conference convened by the two routes involves many issues of common interest to the various businesses, our Chamber and you all should have the need to exchange opinions with each other. Therefore, we specially invited you to a tea party upon your arrival in Shanghai, both to renew acquaintances and to receive instruction. We are greatly honored by your presence. Looking back in recent years, various departments have convened various national conferences. Not long after the adjournment of these conferences, the two Railway Bureaus are now convening a business conference, all to communicate the will of the government and businesses, giving them the opportunity to voice their grievances and express their opinions. Although the scope of this Two-Route Business Conference is incomparable in size to the previous conferences of the various departments, the more extensive the scope of a matter, the more stakeholders are involved, and the more obstacles there are to implementation. Many proposals have been put forward at the various conferences, but how many of these proposals have been resolved and implemented to this day? Not only is our Chamber unable to understand this clearly, but I fear that the representatives present here are also unable to understand it clearly. This is sufficient to show that the greater the scope of involvement, the more difficult it is to implement. Unexpectedly, the scope of this Two-Route Business Conference is limited to transportation, and the area is limited to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines. However, the greatest pain that merchants have felt over the years is twofold: one is excessive taxes and levies, and the other is transportation delays. The abolition of internal customs duties and the realization of it is the first issue, which can be said to have a chance of being resolved. The Two-Route Business Conference is an opportunity to resolve the second issue. Therefore, today, when we speak broadly of revitalizing industry, the scope is vast, and it is like the ancients saying, "Where to start with the seventeen histories?" It is better to focus on the transportation issue, which is closely related to our interests, and calmly discuss a satisfactory implementation plan.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>So that the second problem also has a chance to be resolved like the abolition of internal customs duties. Then, truly accomplishing one or two things will greatly benefit the merchants. Although the scope of this conference is small, the actual harvest may be above the level of the industrial and commercial conferences. As Mencius said, "Going far must begin from the near," and Zeng Guofan said, "Simple words and humble thoughts." These two sayings are sufficient to be our guide in handling affairs today. However, in order for this conference to have practical results, our Chamber believes that there are two matters that should also be noted. (1) Each representative should concentrate their spirit on a few key proposals, have a firm attitude, and make consistent demands. The common problem of past conferences has been to treat proposals as decorations. The way they propose them is like scholars taking exams in the past, greedy for quantity and trying to show off their talents. Before the event, they cite classics and talk loudly, fearing that there will not be enough proposals. Afterwards, they do not care whether they are implemented or not. There is a saying, "He who seeks with sincerity will be answered with sincerity." Although there have been many proposals at previous conferences, many of them cannot be achieved with the current financial and material resources of the country. Even the proposers know that their implementation is not easy, and they only use them as an opportunity to exaggerate and compete. The government authorities, seeing this hidden situation, then postpone even those that can be implemented, causing those who worry about the times to sigh, "There are many conferences but few successes." With past mistakes as a warning, we should be vigilant. We believe that this time, we should not seek too many proposals, nor should we seek too high-sounding arguments. We must ensure that the proposals are all for matters that urgently need to be implemented and that they are all carefully considered and reasonable and can be achieved by the government. Then, the Railway Bureau, seeing the sincere and loyal attitude of the merchants, will be able to sincerely accept the various proposals put forward at the meeting and strive for their implementation, eliminating the previous ills of "resolving without acting" and "acting without implementing." This is what is meant by "mutual sincerity," (2) For each case decided at this conference, the chambers of commerce along the line should pay attention to whether it is implemented at any time and urge its implementation. According to the cases decided, those whose nature is slightly important should be approved by the Ministry of Railways before they can be implemented. Therefore, from the decision to the full implementation, there will naturally be a considerable amount of time. The task of each representative attending this meeting ends with the closing of the meeting. If there is no mechanism to pay attention and urge at any time, then it may not be possible to avoid the mistakes of the past, such as "once the meeting is adjourned, no one cares whether it is implemented or not." We believe that this responsibility should be borne by the chambers of commerce along the two lines. The cases decided by this conference should be listed one by one, like students having a timetable. The day when the decision is fully implemented is the day when the chamber of commerce's timetable ends. Those who know the most about which of the resolutions have been implemented and which have not been implemented are those in the transportation industry, so the responsibility for reporting should be borne by that industry. Those that can be implemented within the authority of the Railway Bureau should be urged to be implemented by the Railway Bureau at any time. Those that must be approved by the Ministry of Railways before they can be implemented should assume a considerable period of time. If they have not been implemented after this period, they should urge the Railway Bureau to submit them to the Ministry, and the chambers of commerce should each telegraph the Ministry to urge their handling. In short, we must eliminate the accumulated habit of "one meeting and done" and not pay attention to whether the proposals are implemented, so that one resolution can achieve the effect of one resolution. Because today's meeting is not a customary reception, and from the standpoint of commerce, we and the representatives present here share weal and woe, and our friendship is like a single tomb, so we have pointed out the common problems of previous meetings and spoken frankly, without any checking. Our Chamber asks itself, that it has not been able to avoid this common problem, so after reflecting on itself, it has pointed out its shortcomings to serve as a resource for mutual criticism and to plan for future improvements. We hope that you will understand and be fortunate.</p>
<p>Liu Weizhi's speech briefly stated that the development of industry and commerce and the railway transportation business are directly proportional. The railway is a special business and belongs to the public utility business. Of course, it cannot seek profit diligently, and must at the same time take into account the interests of industry and commerce. However, on the side of industry and commerce, it must also enable the railway business to maintain its proper position, so that both parties have interests; otherwise, if each party cares for only one side, it will inevitably lead to bias and defeat. The main purpose of this conference is that the two railway authorities are willing to seek practical connections and cooperation with the industrial and commercial sectors with an extremely fair and sincere attitude. The most important points that the representatives hope from the two railway authorities are (1) reducing freight rates, because railway freight rates are more expensive than water transport. Although the length of railway transport is faster than water transport, the Railway Bureau is still extremely willing to give serious and detailed consideration to the issue of freight rates, and decide to reduce freight rates on several or part of the goods to benefit commerce. (2) Cargo safety. On the part of the Railway Bureau, it is also willing to find appropriate guarantees within the possible scope, or formulate separate rules in accordance with the insurance method. As for merchants transporting goods, in addition to the formal freight paid in accordance with the regulations, if there are any staff members who demand money, it is extremely desirable for all industries and merchants to be able to report them at any time. The Railway Bureau will thoroughly investigate and punish them. In short, the cases decided at the business conference, no matter how difficult they are on the part of the Railway Bureau, will be implemented one by one to appease the earnest hopes of the representatives.</p>
<p>Zheng Baozhao's speech briefly stated that the Railway Bureau's Vehicle Department is willing to use the two words "sincerity" as the aim of this conference. The so-called sincerity is: first, those that the Railway Bureau can do will be done immediately. As for those that the Railway Bureau cannot do, please give the representatives some time so that they can be realized within a reasonable time. Second, it is hoped that the Railway Bureau and the representatives can understand each other's difficulties and cooperate forever, eliminating the previous estrangement. The Railway Bureau's authorities cannot have the same close contact with the merchants as the staff members do, and therefore what they see and hear may be concealed. It is hoped that the representatives can point them out at any time, and the Railway Bureau will never conceal them. This is what the Railway Bureau's Vehicle Department especially wants to use a sincere attitude to report to the representatives.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Mayor Zhang Talks About Municipal Administration <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Managing the Old City to Revitalize the Chinese-Administered Areas</p>
<p>Constructing a New City Area to Realize the Greater Shanghai Plan</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun held a tea party for news reporters yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Government Club at No. 43 Weihaiwei Road, and reported on the past and future of the municipal administration. As the scope of municipal work is very wide, yesterday's talks only covered the two items of public works and public utilities, with particular emphasis on the new municipal government building in the city center. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 7 this year, the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government. The construction cost of the new municipal government building is about 500,000 yuan, and it will be completed in one year. It can be said that the start of construction on that day marks the beginning of the construction of the city center and is the initial step in realizing Sun Yat-sen's Greater Shanghai Plan.</p>
<p>The Effect of Managing the Old City Mayor Zhang said that the Shanghai Municipal Government has been established for more than three years. The most important goal in terms of work is to complete the construction during the tutelage period and realize Sun Yat-sen's Greater Shanghai Plan. However, in the past three years, it has been mostly constrained by the times and limited by financial resources, and it is shameful that the results have not been remarkable and there has been little immediate success. The management of the old city can only maintain the status quo and seek gradual progress. As for the opening of the new city, only a plan has been drafted and construction has not yet started. Now that the tutelage period has begun, it is appropriate to gather wisdom and strength.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Meaning of Eliminating the Likin Tax and the Understanding Our People Should Have <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Our party, the Chinese Kuomintang, is a party that represents the interests of the people. Therefore, during the military administration period, it used revolutionary force to eliminate all warlords who exploited and oppressed the people. During the tutelage period, in addition to striving for construction projects, it also used revolutionary means to ruthlessly eliminate bad systems that exploited the interests of the people.</p>
<p>The Likin tax originated in the third year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, due to the turmoil caused by the Taiping Rebellion and the shortage of military funds, Yi Cheng, the Jiangsu Provincial Administration Commissioner, first started collecting the Likin tax at the Fairy Maiden Temple near Yangzhou. It was originally temporary in nature, but after the rebellion was quelled, it became quite abundant in revenue and greatly benefited the national financial income. Not only was it not immediately abolished, but it was intensified, and all provinces followed suit. The tax rates also varied, and it became an unbreakable domestic tax that harmed merchants and the people.</p>
<p>There are now as many as 690 Likin stations across the country. Speaking of its drawbacks, they are too numerous to mention. Now, let me list the major ones as follows: (1) Exploiting Merchants: Because the Likin tax rates are inconsistent, merchants have no way to calculate the weight of their burden and the thickness of their profits, so they regard commerce as a dangerous path. The central government has no unified laws and regulations, and allows officials in various provinces to arbitrarily increase or decrease taxes, and exploit them in every possible way. In addition, they engage in fraud and embezzlement, and use various excuses to extort money. As a result, tax officials are like tigers and wolves, and small merchants are like lambs. They are subjected to multiple inspections and step-by-step exploitation. Even the slightest amount of goods is often delayed for as long as a year due to the obstruction of checkpoints, and they do not find it strange. (2) Hindering Industry: Industry is the lifeblood of a country's economy. The reason why China's industry has not prospered to this day is due to the existence of the Likin tax system. The same goods, foreign goods, only need to pay an import tax of 5% and a sub-port tax of 2.5% at the port of entry, and then they can circulate throughout the country without hindrance. Domestic goods are not the same. From the place of production to the place of sale, there are layers of Likin stations, heavy levies and exorbitant taxes. As a result, goods of the same value, foreign goods, are priced lower due to light taxes, while domestic goods are heavily taxed and the cost is increased. As a result, foreign goods sell well, and domestic goods are sluggish. The hindrance of the Likin tax to industry is simply a direct hindrance to the country's economic lifeline. (3) Increasing the burden on the people: A good national tax should adopt the principle of "direct," so that taxpayers do not pass on the increased tax burden to others. For example, if a commodity is taxed too heavily due to the Likin tax, merchants will certainly not sell it at a loss, so they raise the price. The general consumer public therefore bears an increased burden. The current high prices and difficult livelihoods can be said to be entirely due to the Likin tax. (4) A breeding ground for corruption: According to accurate statistics, there are 1.6 million people in China who rely on the Likin tax to make a living. Their skills are to flatter and curry favor, and their ability is to suck and exploit. After obtaining a lucrative Likin position, they can accumulate a huge fortune in a few years and become wealthy, while merchants, peddlers, and the general public across the country are directly and indirectly sacrificed by them, falling into a state of loss of property and increasing poverty. Wealthy merchants and powerful institutions can use government offices as a shield to openly evade taxes, and Likin officials dare not interfere. The most acutely affected are the small merchants who bear a heavy burden of hard-earned capital. The Likin tax system is truly evil.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen of our party, in view of the evils of the Likin tax, undoubtedly added the abolition of the Likin tax to the political program of the Chinese Kuomintang. The National Government also resolutely ordered its abolition from New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Regardless of the opposition, saying that after the abolition of the Likin tax, 1.6 million people will have no way to make a living, but may I ask, can the livelihood of 390 million people be affected by the livelihood problem of 1.6 million rice worms? Is obstruction by petty warlords and local bullies a concern that a revolutionary government should have? As for the national finances being thrown into panic, the 2.5% surtax on customs duties can be effectively collected, and it can certainly be used to supplement the finances. Furthermore, when customs duties are completely autonomous in the future, the tax rate will increase, and the income will only increase, so there is no need to worry.</p>
<p>Therefore, this time, our party has made a great determination to abolish the Likin tax, and the government has made the greatest efforts to do it, without any hesitation, retreat, or compromise. We hope that the people of the whole country will give great help and promotion to the government in its efforts to eliminate the bad administration. Our slogan is to support the National Government's policy of abolishing the Likin tax. Abolishing the Likin tax is to realize the political program of our party. Abolishing the Likin tax is to promote the work of tutelage. Abolishing the Likin tax is the first step towards seeking China's economic freedom, equality, and liberation. Opposing the abolition of the Likin tax is a traitor to the revolution and a public enemy of the people. All the people of the country should unanimously assist the government in abolishing the Likin tax. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang!</p>
<h3 id="e110">Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>planning and management, striving for the implementation of the plan, so that the grand vision of construction can be finally achieved. The following is a brief report on the recent work in progress. The Shanghai Municipal Government now directly governs 17 urban areas. Except for the two districts of Huhang and Zhabei, most of them are still in the state of rural society. However, although the facilities in the two districts of Huhang and Zhabei have taken a preliminary shape, they are indeed far behind the adjacent concessions. Therefore, the transformation of the old urban area is indeed an urgent task. Since the establishment of the Public Works Bureau, its main work has been to reorganize the old urban area, accounting for the majority. The reorganization of the old urban area is nothing more than two ends: widening narrow streets and improving unsanitary areas. According to the north-south two districts, the old roads are mostly winding, narrow and extremely chaotic. Because of the obstacles to traffic, it is the cause of commercial depression. Before the reorganization, a comprehensive plan was made, and the road system was drawn by districts, so that the widening and improvement of the project can be followed. The widening of roads, or when citizens build houses, according to the road system, scattered acquisitions, or important routes, need to be widened, then the municipal government will reorganize at once, step by step, and finally change the chaotic state of the old urban area before. The road system map of Huhang and Zhabei districts was announced the earliest, and the implementation was very smooth. Recently, there is a road system plan for the west of Shanghai district, the significance of which is not only to reorganize the old roads. The west of Shanghai is entirely within the scope of the road construction forces beyond the boundary, and the area surrounded is wider than the public concession area. (According to the concession authorities, the construction of roads beyond the boundary over the years, from the 26th year of Guangxu to the 14th year of the Republic of China, is about 11 li in the north of Shanghai and about 165 li in the west of Shanghai, with a total length of 205,000 English feet.) If it is not remedied quickly, the consequences will be even more unimaginable. The municipal government, in view of this, has the construction of Zhongshan Road, the first plan to connect the traffic between the north and south cities. This time, it has taken a further step and announced the road system map of the west of Shanghai district. In the area east of Zhongshan Road and west of the concession line, it integrates the original road construction beyond the boundary and arranges the road network into a system, so that it can be connected with the road system of Huhang and Zhabei districts and form a whole. This is the city's overall plan for reorganizing the old urban area. In the past three years, a total of 46 li of new roads have been added, 101 li of roads have been rebuilt, 37 li of ditches have been buried, 45 bridges of various sizes have been built, 16 wharves, and more than 1,000 meters of embankments. The projects that are about to be held include the construction of Wenmiao Park, the burial of Puzhao River ditches, the opening of Ximen Road, and the widening of Limalu. Since the widening of Dongmen Road, the advantages and disadvantages of the city's road construction levy regulations have been obvious to everyone, and the revitalization of the market and the increase in land prices are even more remarkable facts. I dare to believe that in the future, widening the old roads will not only be difficult for the citizens, but also many will be willing to organize it themselves. At the same time, related to the reorganization of the old urban area, is a citizen-built project. In the past three years, the city's annual construction has increased from more than 3.13 million yuan to 15 million yuan, which proves the progress of construction over the years. In other words, it is not the effect of reorganizing the old urban area. However, the holding of the project requires a lot of money. At this time, the city's funds have not reached a prosperous state, and the implementation of the entire plan is difficult to complete in one go. It can only be carried out step by step, and it is not easy to plan for long-term and rapid results.</p>
<p>Building the city center area, Shanghai's position, in terms of the country, has become the largest commercial port, and in terms of the world, it also occupies a considerable position. However, the so-called prosperous area is only a small area of the concession. In the future, if we want to further develop Shanghai, we must use a long-term vision and make careful and detailed plans, which is not enough to meet the needs of the future. When examining the shortcomings of the current Shanghai municipal administration, the most important ones are the following three: (1) The concession lies across the center of the city, so that the traffic between Huhang and Zhabei is separated and the facilities cannot be unified. (2) Shanghai's waterways and railways cannot be connected to each other, and the transportation of goods is not convenient and uneconomical. (3) In recent years, the tonnage of sea ships has increased sharply, and the existing wharf location and equipment are no longer applicable, so that most of the sea ships have to be anchored at the mouth of the Huangpu River. If a large-scale new port is not built quickly to accommodate giant ships, Shanghai's position as a commercial port in the world will inevitably be difficult to maintain. In terms of the current situation, the recovery of the concession is only a matter of time. After the recovery of the concession, the first shortcoming can be improved, but in order to remedy the second and third shortcomings, it is imperative to open the port of Wusong and add railways. If so, then the entire city center will inevitably move north from the concession to the Jiangwan area in the future. The terrain there is flat and the location is superior. It can connect the current commercial center and the new commercial port in the future, and is enough to be the hub of the entire city. And a piece of wilderness can be built on the ground without the trouble of improving the old urban area. Therefore, in the autumn of the 18th year, the municipal government delineated the area north of Xiangyin Road, south of Zhayin Road, east of Songhu Road, and west of Zhou Nan Shi Tu Yi Wu Tu as the city center area. In the past year, it has been actively planning and preparing for construction. The completed work includes the city's main road system and zoning plan, the city center area road system and the city center zoning plan, the municipal government building design, and the phased construction plan. All the layouts are based on the latest theories. Regarding the construction of railways, the selection of commercial port locations, the zoning of various industries, the smoothness of traffic, parks, forests, sports fields, and airport facilities, everything is well prepared. We also invited Chinese and foreign experts to carefully review it to show seriousness. Since the construction of trunk roads such as Songhu Road and Xiangzha Road began last winter, the progress has been exceptionally smooth. This autumn, the municipal government buildings will also be built in the city center administrative area to show promotion. However, the construction of the city center and commercial port involves many aspects, and the work is difficult and costly, which cannot be borne by the municipal government alone. The people of the whole city must work together with one heart to support the progress in order to succeed. To gain the support of the citizens, we must first seek the citizens' understanding of the significance of building a new urban area, then we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. For detailed information and planning instructions, refer to the "Planning Book for the Construction of the City Center Area", which will not be repeated here. As for public utilities, four new ferries have been added in Pujiang, two for long-distance voyages and two for short-distance voyages, and the fees are very low.</p>

<p>Three of the Four Injuries Have Healed</p>
<p>Reading Books and Newspapers as a Distraction in Bed</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, received reporters from various newspapers at the Orthopedic Hospital on Xujiahui Road yesterday morning. Around 9:30, reporters from various newspapers arrived one after another. They were received by Wu Hongyu from the Orthopedic Hospital, and visited the entire hospital for a week. The various arrangements were in good order, especially the children's ward. At 10:15, Jiang Yi, the chief of the adjutant office of the Garrison Headquarters, and Li Dezhao, the chief of the military supply office, personally came out to receive them and led the reporters to ward No. 1 to meet Xiong. Xiong was wearing a gray spring cotton robe, lying on the bed, with a ruddy complexion and excellent spirits, but slightly thinner. Seeing the reporters arrive, he smiled and nodded, saying, "I haven't seen you for a long time." The reporters immediately expressed their condolences in detail. According to him, when the plane crashed, I was quite clear-headed. Even now, when I think back, the scene is vivid in my mind. The responsibility for the accident should be attributed to the pilot's poor skills. I heard that he was a retired pilot from the European War, and according to the rules, he should not be allowed to fly again. In short, with the immaturity of China's aviation industry today, we are subject to foreigners at every turn, which is regrettable. I have a total of four injuries, two head injuries have fully healed, the bandage on my left arm has been removed, and I can stretch freely. My right foot still needs to rest quietly, and the splint and bandage can be removed in more than a month. Lying on my back for many days, unable to turn over, is very painful. I heard that Yang Yongtai suffered internal injuries, and he can leave the hospital in three or four weeks. I have already eaten rice, and I read newspapers and various books in my spare time, so I am not so lonely. I am very grateful for the many visits and condolences from gentlemen from all walks of life. On Xiong's bedside, there were several books of Jiannan Poetry Collection and Suiyuan Poetry Talks. On the wall hung a couplet handwritten by Wang Yiting, with the line "There is nothing in sight, turning into brightness," which shows a sense of tranquility. It was already 10:40, and the reporters said goodbye and left. Zhang Qun, the mayor, went earlier than the reporters yesterday morning and talked for about ten minutes.

<p>The Municipal Government Has Not Received a Concrete Plan</p>
<p>The talk of building a bridge over the Huangpu River has been rampant recently. Zhang Qun, the mayor of Shanghai Special City, mentioned this matter when he received reporters yesterday, saying that the atmosphere of building a bridge over the Huangpu River has been around for a long time. The municipal government welcomes citizens to hold construction projects, and will strongly support it. However, building a bridge over the Huangpu River is very expensive, and it is not easy to proceed without a detailed plan and collected funds. The municipal government has only received the document on the matter, and has not yet seen a concrete plan. The matter has now been handed over to the competent authorities for handling. It is planning to summon the initiator to inquire, and after receiving the detailed plan and understanding the construction funds, the Public Works Bureau will study it, and it will be approved.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Public Concession Prohibits Dog Racing <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Mingyuan Board of Directors Expressed Its Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Public Works Bureau Has Not Changed</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of banning dog racing fields in the Public Concession, Fessenden, the director of the Public Works Bureau, based on the resolution of the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors, notified the two dog racing fields, Mingyuan and Shenyuan, at the beginning of the month, limiting them to close on March 31 of this year, etc. The details have been published in the previous newspaper. It is now known that McBain, the chairman of the Mingyuan Dog Racing Field, sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau on the 14th, expressing his dissatisfaction. The letter stated that dog racing is a legitimate business, and that the three-month deadline is not enough to end all affairs, and that the closure of the dog racing field will cause great losses to the rights of shareholders. He proposed that the provisions of the compensation amount be submitted to arbitration. A reporter from this newspaper visited Fessenden, the director of the Public Works Bureau, yesterday to inquire about the attitude of the Public Works Bureau after receiving the letter. Fessenden replied that he had not had the opportunity to submit the letter from Mingyuan to the Board of Directors. Roughly speaking, the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors can submit it for discussion at its regular meeting next Wednesday. He has no right to answer on behalf of the directors what their attitude is, but the resolution of the Public Works Bureau to order the dog racing field to close on March 31 will not change in any way. Therefore, the letter from the Mingyuan Dog Racing Field has absolutely no impact on the ban of the Public Works Bureau. The topic to be discussed at the next regular meeting of the Public Works Bureau Board of Directors will be the scope of the aftermath of the closure of the dog racing field at the end of March. As for the dog racing field's proposal to organize arbitration to resolve and remedy the losses, it is not impossible to do so.</p>

<p>The Chenghuang Temple Will Also Be Transformed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that there are very few parks in the Chinese area, and citizens lack opportunities for recreation. It has now decided to transform the existing Wenmiao in Nanshi into a Wenmiao Park. Detailed drawings have been drawn up by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. The funds for the transformation have also been allocated by the Municipal Government. According to the transformation plan, the Dacheng Hall and the Zhisheng Hall in the Wenmiao will be preserved, and the rest of the old houses will be demolished and new music rooms and libraries will be built. After the transformation of Wenmiao Park, the Chenghuang Temple will be transformed into a more perfect public recreation place.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Yihe Building Runner Shen Shou Kang Committed Suicide <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Sacrificed Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>The Water Patrol Police Retrieved the Body</p>
<p>Shen Shou Kang, a building runner in the accounting room of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., committed suicide by jumping into the sea due to the inability to make up for the embezzlement of public funds. The following is a record of the information obtained by reporters from various parties through investigations:</p>
<p>The history of the deceased Shen Shou Kang, a building runner in the accounting room of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., was a native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He was only 25 years old. His father was an old servant in a foreign firm. There was no permanent property in the family. He had two brothers. Shou Kang was married and had a child each. Only his monthly salary was limited, and his family still lived in his hometown and did not come to Shanghai. He had a younger brother who was working in a money shop. He was usually serious in his work and had no habit of wandering and waste. He also lived in the firm.</p>
<p>Embezzlement of Public Funds Shen Shou Kang has been serving in the accounting room of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. for five or six years. His position is known as a building runner, which is to collect customer accounts, so he has funds in hand. It has been found that the salaries of the staff in the comprador section of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. are very meager. Senior staff members earn no more than forty or fifty yuan. Shen Shou Kang's monthly salary was only twenty-four yuan. How could he take care of his family with such a high level of living? Unable to make ends meet, the deficit was taken from the public funds collected. Over time, by the end of last month, the total amount used was more than two thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The Comprador Demanded Payment At the end of the year, according to commercial practice, the comprador of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. settled accounts with Shen, who handed over the remaining foreign currency. Shen had embezzled two thousand yuan. The comprador questioned where the money had gone. He said that his monthly salary was not enough to support his family, so he had gradually used it to support his family. The comprador, Mr. Pan, ordered him to pay the money in full, without any leniency. Shen, unable to raise the money at that time, conceived a pessimistic idea and jumped into the sea to commit suicide. It was a tragedy.</p>
<p>The Suicide Note Complained Shen was forced by the comprador to pay the money, and at that time, he said that he would wait to go out to raise the money. He left the firm last Saturday, never to return. Shen originally lived in the firm. His colleagues, seeing that he had suddenly not come, initially thought that he had returned to Shaoxing to raise money, and did not suspect anything else. It was not until the 14th of the previous day that the comprador of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Mr. Pan, suddenly received a letter from Shen Shou Kang, in which the wording was very sad. He described that his family of several people relied entirely on his monthly salary of twenty-four yuan for food and clothing, and could not support them. He had no choice but to embezzle the account money. He used 2,000 yuan in a year, and there was no dissipation of wandering. Now, because he was forced to pay it back, there was no way to do it. He also said that with such a life, there was no hope of economic prosperity. Rather than living and suffering mentally, it was better to die. He decided to jump into the sea and die. By the time this letter arrived, he had already ended his life. There was another letter to his younger brother, with roughly the same wording. Both letters are now with Mr. Pan and his younger brother.</p>
<p>Reported to the Police and Searched for the Body The firm was very anxious about Shen's disappearance. Later, after receiving his letter, they knew that he had committed suicide. They urgently reported to his younger brother, and the younger brother also received his brother's suicide note. In grief, he went to the water patrol police station to report and searched for his body in the Huangpu River. It has not been found yet. Fearing that he had jumped into the sea in Wusong, they asked the water patrol police station to help them search for him.</p>

<p>Rescued the Hostages... Killed the Bandit Leader</p>
<p>Several bandit ships sneaked into Shark Port outside Wusongkou at about 4:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. The leaders were Zheng Changji and Xu San, two well-known Jiangnan kidnappers. They immediately led their men to land with weapons and hid in a small building on the edge of the port. The 18th team of the 4th district of the water police discovered this and reported to the brigade commander Lin Junsheng. After receiving the report, Brigade Commander Lin immediately led his team to rush to suppress the bandits together with the Haimen County police team. When they reached their destination, they saw that the bandits were all hiding in the building. They immediately ordered to open fire and shot at the small building. The bandits returned fire. They resisted stubbornly at first, but after fighting for more than an hour, they all rushed out of the door and fled back to the bandit ships. Bandit leader Xu San was shot and killed, and Zheng Changji was captured. They then used quick guns to sink a bandit ship. In this battle, they seized four rifles from the bandits and rescued Cui Jin, a hostage from Taicang, and Wang Jiaowa, a young girl from Changshu. They have been sent back to their hometowns separately.</p>

<p>All Five Hostages Rescued</p>
<p>The Zhongshan warship rescued the hostages. After the Zhaoshang Bureau's New Ming steamer was robbed in the Min Sea, General Manager Li Zhonggong immediately telegraphed the authorities in Fujian, Xiamen, and Guangdong, requesting them to send warships to pursue the fleeing bandits and rescue the kidnapped individuals. Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, first ordered the Zhongshan warship to proceed to Xianghai Bay and Dapeng Bay to suppress the pirates who had robbed the ship. It was reported that the Zhongshan warship set off on the 13th. At that time, the pirates had not yet fled far. Yesterday at noon, a certain Hakka in this port received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that the pirates who had fled to Dapeng Bay had been overtaken by the Zhongshan warship. Most of the bandits had already unloaded the stolen goods ashore. The kidnapped passengers Chen Zhong and others, along with ship inspector Zhang, were rescued by the navy from the Zhongshan warship when they went ashore to pursue the bandits. All five hostages were recovered and are now being escorted to Guangdong. All hostages are safe and sound and will soon be sent back to Fujian and Shanghai. The detailed situation has not yet been reported, as the Zhongshan warship is still tracking and attacking the bandits. The speed of this rescue is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The New Ming Steamer has arrived in Fuzhou. Yesterday, Branch Managers Wu Zhuce and Wang Jiheng of the Xiamen and Min bureaus sent a follow-up telegram to the Shanghai bureau, stating that the cargo on the New Ming steamer was being guarded by sailors, and the ship had left Xiamen and would arrive in Fuzhou at 5 PM on the 15th. A second telegram stated that they had received the two telegrams. The Xiamen bureau had supplied coal and provisions to the New Ming. The damaged cargo at each hatch had been sealed by the heads of the Min and Xiamen branches. The cargo in the second-class cabin was the responsibility of the ship's business department personnel. As for the robbery situation, it had been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Ceheng requested Commander Lin of the Xiamen Navy and urgently telegraphed the Guangdong fleet to find ways to investigate and arrest the pirates and rescue the kidnapped personnel. They also requested your honor to forward the request to the Naval Headquarters, sending telegrams to assist in the investigation to comfort the families of the robbed. They further requested that all ships be ordered to install iron nets and increase armed guards in the cabins to ensure passenger safety and protect cargo transportation. Submitted jointly by the Min and Xiamen bureau chiefs.</p>
<p>Surveyor Inspects Lost Goods. Given the significant amount of cargo stolen in this New Ming robbery, in order to clearly understand the amount of damage and to ensure fairness, Shen Zhongyi, the Chief of the Business Section of the bureau, telegraphed the Min branch, ordering that after the New Ming arrives in Fuzhou on the designated day, experts should be hired in the city to invite guests and cargo owners to the scene to conduct an impartial inspection. The surveyor will directly inspect and report the lost and damaged goods inside the ship to inform the guests. Then, based on the surveyor's report of lost and damaged goods, procedures for handling compensation will be carried out.</p>
<p>Re-Telegraphing the Navy to Pursue Bandits. Yesterday, General Manager Li also telegraphed the Naval Headquarters, urging them to quickly order Xiamen warships to pursue and suppress the fleeing bandits in separate directions and to recover the stolen goods. He also discussed with the Chief of the Shipping Section and the Chief of the Business Section the installation of iron nets on naval vessels and the deployment of armed guards to ensure safety.</p>

<p>Eight Boys and Girls Awaiting Claim</p>
<p>Over One Hundred People Have Come to Identify</p>
<p>The Pujiang Water Patrol Police, while investigating a large-scale kidnapping gang on a Dada Company steamer, arrested Zhang Guangsheng, Zhang Yiqiu, Li Chen, Huang Li, Zhang Shao, Chen Lin, Ding Chen, and a large number of kidnapped boys and girls. They were handed over to the Public Security Bureau. Apart from those who were claimed by their families, there are still eight children, including Jin Ashuang, Ding Adi, Li (male child), Chen Xiaorong, Sun Genbao, Lin Amao, Song Siyuan, and Zheng Meimei, who have been sent to the local court to await claim. The kidnappers are being held in custody. However, it has been four days since they were handed over to the court, and every day, thirty to forty people come to the court to identify the children, hoping they are their own children. In total, over one hundred victimized families have come over the four days, but none of them have found their own flesh and blood. In the coming days, there will still be many people coming to identify, showing how many kidnappers there are in Shanghai and how many families have lost children. The separation of loved ones is truly outrageous.</p>

<p>Car Thrown into River</p>
<p>Passengers and Driver Unharmed</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:45, a Western engineer from the Kailuan Company, Bi Shidong, hired a No. 17664 (City No. 563) commercial car from the Zha Pu Road Dada Automobile Company to go to the Rihui Bridge outside the South City to work. The car was driven by driver Li Shouchu. When the car reached the vicinity of the railway on Da Yong Road, heading south to north, the driver accelerated, intending to cross the railway. However, a Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo locomotive, heading from the South Station to Xin Longhua to pick up an express train, could not avoid it, and the two vehicles collided violently. The car was immediately thrown into the river. Engineer Bi and the driver were both seriously injured. The patrol police of the Second District Headquarters noticed and reported to the headquarters. However, both the driver and Engineer Bi went to the hospital for treatment on their own. It is reported that they were not seriously injured.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Regulations for Parking on Hongqiao Road <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Joint Announcement by the Municipal Public Works Bureau and Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau and Public Security Bureau: Regarding the joint announcement, according to a report from the Chief of the First Station of the Sixth District of the Public Security Bureau, the foreign and Chinese residents in this port are mixed, and there is a mix of good and bad. Recently, cases of kidnapping have been repeatedly reported in both the Chinese and Foreign Concessions. The only tool used by kidnappers is often automobiles. The police have a special responsibility to maintain public safety and prevent and arrest kidnappers. Therefore, your honor instructed each district and station to set up checkpoints to inspect passing cars and pedestrians during the last business meeting, which is an excellent way to eliminate bandits. After implementing the order, it has been effective. For example, as reported on November 9, the case of Chai Renji stealing wood is clear evidence. It has been found that the Hongqiao Road area under my jurisdiction is a remote area in western Shanghai and a frequent route for Chinese and foreign travelers. Passengers often abandon their cars on the roadside for five or six hours, or even all day, without driving them away. The police often mistakenly believe these are the cars of kidnappers, searching everywhere, worried all day. After clarifying the identity of the person in the car, they say they went to a banquet somewhere or hunting in the distance. The car owner only needs to make a brief statement to safely retrieve the car. The police, with the duty to protect the people, dare not complain about their labor in searching all day. However, car owners arbitrarily abandoning their cars on the roadside not only easily leads to misunderstandings and obstructs traffic but also violates police regulations and cannot avoid punishment. It is proposed that your bureaus jointly announce to all car owners that, hereafter, when parking on Hongqiao Road in western</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Shanghai, drivers must remain in the car to wait. If questioned by police officers, they must immediately present their licenses for inspection. This method will not cause any difficulty for passengers and will clearly distinguish between good and bad, effectively protecting the people. If, after the announcement, there are still those who do not comply, the responsible district and station are authorized to detain the case and punish them according to law, to serve as a warning and maintain public safety. Is this appropriate? We hereby submit a written request for your approval and compliance. In accordance with this, the Public Security Bureau has consulted with the Public Works Bureau and decided on measures to be taken for compliance. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government for record, the following measures are listed below, announced for general knowledge, and must be obeyed without violation. This is the announcement. The measures for prohibiting parking on Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai are as follows: 1. When private cars are parked in the Hongqiao area, a driver must remain in the car. If the car owner is driving himself, someone must also stay to watch the car. When questioned by the police, all licenses must be presented for inspection immediately. 2. When commercial cars are parked in the Hongqiao area, a driver must remain to wait. If questioned by the police, all licenses must be presented for inspection. 3. Temporary parking areas must not obstruct traffic. 4. Violations of the above measures will be punished according to regulations. January of the twentieth year of the Republic of China. Director of the Public Works Bureau, Huang Boqiao.

<p>Hoping that the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association Will Resolve the Issue</p>
<p>French Municipal Council Still Requires Vendors to Pay License Fees as Before</p>
<p>The vegetable vendors in the Eight Immortals Bridge market in the French Concession, due to the French Municipal Council's revised regulations regarding the bidding method for renting stalls, have aroused resentment among all the vendors. They have publicly elected representatives to send letters to various organizations for assistance, hoping to maintain their livelihoods. They have painstakingly raised funds to set up stalls. They have also petitioned the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association twice and the French Municipal Council once, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that, due to mediation from various parties, the French authorities have canceled the bidding method. Since the day before yesterday, all vendors have been notified to pay license fees as before. However, it will be temporarily difficult for the new stalls to be occupied. Furthermore, the stall rental fees have not yet been decided by the Public Works Bureau meeting. Various organizations have expressed their support for the vendors' requests, hoping that the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association will resolve the issue quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Hu Fuzhang's Mental Illness Problem <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Hu Aji's son, Hu Fuzhang, a Chinese constable No. 526 of the Hongkou police station, on the evening of September 30 last year, held a kitchen knife in front of his house at No. 187 Chang Kang Li, Alabaster Road, intending to kill his birth mother, Ms. Ma. His father turned him over to the police station and sent him to the Special District Local Court. According to his father and others, Hu Fuzhang suffered from mental illness and was sent for medical examination. The Western doctor of the Municipal Council and the forensic doctor of the court came to different conclusions after examining him. The Western doctor of the Municipal Council said that he did not have any mental illness, while the forensic doctor of the Special Court said that he was suffering from mental illness. As a result, the judge did not know what to do and could not interrogate him, and ordered him to be examined in detail and reported again for review. Now, Wang Changlai, the Western doctor of the Municipal Council, has written a report to the Special Court on the condition of Hu Fuzhang's examination. The report stated: "Hu Fuzhang was sent to the Chinese Constable Hospital of the Municipal Council by the Huishi Police Station on November 12, 19th year of the Republic of China, on the order of your court. The doctor personally examined him every day and instructed the on-duty nurses to closely monitor all his actions and interactions with others. On November 25th, he was transferred to the Municipal Council Prison Hospital for continued examination. However, during the fourteen days that the defendant was in the Chinese Constable Hospital, the doctor's examination, the nurses' reports, and the discussions of the other inmates all proved that the defendant was no different from ordinary people. Now, according to the certificates of Zhou Liangquan and other two doctors of the Municipal Council Prison Hospital and the results of the doctor's examination, it has been determined that the defendant has not shown any signs of mental illness. This is the certificate." Another report from Zhou Liangquan and other two doctors of the Municipal Council Prison Hospital stated: "We have examined the prisoner Hu Fuzhang at the Municipal Council Prison Hospital from November 25, 19th year of the Republic of China, to January 9th of this year. During this period, the prisoner has not shown any signs of mental illness." Yesterday morning, the police sent the defendant to the Special Court to request a continued hearing. However, the court did not have an examination report and was still unable to proceed. Judge Wu briefly questioned the defendant, and according to Hu, he was hospitalized for two months, and the doctor only came to see him once every seven or ten days. He had a seizure in the hospital on December 22 last year, but the doctor did not know about it, etc. Judge Wu ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>Report from the Family of Liu Rongtai</p>
<p>Outlining the Attention of the Railway Bureau and Police Bureau</p>
<p>The Zhabei District Firefighting Federation, due to the death of Liu Rongtai, director of the Third Section Fire Brigade, who was fatally injured by a train while heading out to fight a fire, held an emergency meeting at 2 PM yesterday (the 15th). Those present included Yao Xiangsheng, director of the First Section, Yu Tingkai, director of the Second Section, Chen Jinxiang, acting director of the Third Section, member Chen Weihan, Federation staff Xu Youtang, Jin Shiru, and dozens of others. Chairman Wang Binyan presided over the meeting, conducting the formalities. First, Liu Minsheng, a family member of Liu, reported on the tragic death of Liu Rongtai, stating that at 10:47 PM on the 9th of this month, a fire broke out at You Jinji Cotton Factory, No. 286 Minli Road, Zhabei. Liu Rongtai rushed to the scene in his own car to provide assistance. At the railroad tracks on Gonghe Xin Road, a Shanghai-Hangzhou train was coming to Shanghai, and Liu Rongtai stopped to wait (there was only one gate leaf left at the four-leaf gate, and there was no red light). After the Shanghai-Hangzhou train passed, Liu Rongtai started to drive forward. Unexpectedly, the delayed No. 22 Beijing-Shanghai train arrived. The light from the headlight of the locomotive was not illuminating. Liu Rongtai did not see the light, and since the previous train had just passed and the sound of the wheels was still present, he did not suspect that another train was coming. He was violently hit, and the car was thrown dozens of yards. The train continued on its way, ignoring the incident. Moreover, there was supposed to be a guard booth next to the gate, but the guard also turned a blind eye. Later, the road police called the Central Fire Brigade in the Concession, who transferred the call to the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade. A Western staff member from the brigade, Mr. Henry, and a companion came in a car from the Henan Road Fire Brigade to investigate. However, because the car did not have a Chinese Concession license, it could not enter. They walked to the scene of the accident and identified it as Liu Rongtai. At that time, the wind and snow were severe, and the temperature was below 14 degrees. Liu Rongtai was already covered in several inches of snow. Mr. Henry tried to carry Liu Rongtai into the trackman's room next to the road to avoid freezing to death, but the trackman refused. Mr. Henry had to walk to the First Section Fire Brigade to call and notify the Third Section to immediately send someone in a car to rescue him. However, too much time had passed, and he had been exposed to excessive cold. When the car arrived at Baolong Hospital, the doctor said that the injuries were not severe. Apart from some gasoline burns on his face, there were no injuries on his body. It was simply because he had been exposed to the cold for too long that he could not be saved. Now the coffin is still not closed, and it can be inspected. Please help us to expand the scope of assistance. Moreover, nearby residents said that after the accident, every time a fire truck passed by, they would hear screams for help. After the Third Section Fire Brigade's pumper truck set off, it was overtaken by Liu Rongtai's car on Baoshan Road. If rescue had been provided immediately after the train accident, Liu Rongtai would not have died. It is unreasonable that the firefighters did not notify the Third Section Fire Brigade when the fire truck passed by, as the truck had not yet passed at that time, and it would have been possible to call out. Moreover, the residents heard cries for help when the fire truck returned. If rescue had been provided in time, he would not have died. After a delay of three hours, even a healthy man would have frozen to death after lying in the wind and snow for three hours. Moreover, Liu Rongtai had already suffered shock. The personnel of the Railway Bureau sat idly by and did not provide rescue, neglecting their duties and disregarding human life, which is deeply hateful. You are all comrades of the Firefighting Federation. Please help us to provide assistance to extend our condolences and protect the lives of those who come after. After the report, all those present agreed that the Railway Bureau personnel had failed in their duties, resulting in Liu's tragic death. Moreover, Gonghe Xin Road is a key location, and three of the four gate leaves had been destroyed by armored vehicles. Two or three years had passed, and they had not been repaired. Before the repairs, more staff should have been assigned to hang red lights as a warning to avoid danger. The Railway Bureau had been slow to repair and did not hang red lights, which shows their incompetence. Liu left behind an elderly mother in her seventies, a young wife and concubine, and a ten-year-old son, a tragic sight. Is there anything more terrible than this? If we do not seriously negotiate, how can we comfort the spirit of the departed? It was decided that the Federation should seriously negotiate with the Railway Bureau to achieve its goals and petition the Municipal Government for generous compensation. Chen Weihan and Yao Xiangsheng were appointed to comfort Liu's family. The coffin will be closed immediately, and a funeral date will be chosen. Liu's funeral home will be set up at the Xiangshan Association on Qiujiang Road, and special representatives will be appointed to handle funeral affairs. The funeral expenses will be decided at a later date at a board meeting. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, Committee Member Chu Minyi, accompanied by his wife and Zeng Guangming, the former Director of the Shandong Telegraph Bureau, visited the Zhang Huabang Zhabei Commercial Water and Electricity Plant. They were first accompanied by the plant's engineers, Pan Zhongyun, Shen Heting, and Li Rannan, to various parts of the power plant for detailed explanations. Then, they visited the various parts of the water plant to see the rapid filtration and water distribution. They were served tea and snacks, and hosted by Shen Mingpan, Director of Water Affairs Technology, and Engineer Ren Tingshan. A view of the Water and Electricity Plant (photographed by Three Museums).</p>
<p>It was said that the plant had built a new plant and purchased two sets of water turbines from Czechoslovakia to be operated in rotation to prevent accidents. Since December 24 of the previous winter, supply had begun. The power plant can generate 10,000 open circuit watts per day, and the water plant can supply 12,000 English gallons. The most users use is 9,000 watts of electricity and 9,500 gallons of water. The exterior of the water plant building is entirely Eastern in style, with an engineer's residence and staff dormitory attached. The assets of the two plants are estimated at 11 million yuan. They all said goodbye and returned to Shanghai after 4 PM.</p>

<p>A letter from Dada Tobacco Factory states: "To the esteemed Editor of Shenbao, With respect, After reading Fuxin Tobacco Company's letter in yesterday's newspaper, which completely shirks responsibility, we were very surprised. We hereby present the details of the incident for the public's review. The day after the incident at our factory, we sent a letter to Fuxin Tobacco Company, stating that our factory was commissioned by your company to roll cigarettes, and all the spice mixing machines were borrowed from your company. Your company sent Mr. Zhu to manage the machines. At that time, Mr. Zhu neglected his duties and left his post without permission, resulting in the accident. It seems that our factory cannot bear the responsibility for this matter. After investigation, our factory suffered damage to the machines, and two male workers and twelve female workers were injured and sent to various hospitals for treatment. All future losses must be fully compensated by your company, etc. The mixing of spices for cigarette rolling is different for each factory. Fuxin Tobacco Company borrowed these machines because it did not want our factory to know its secrets, so it sent Mr. Zhu Guangbu and two old stewards to manage them themselves. Therefore, our factory has nothing to do with any responsibility, and the company should naturally bear the burden of the damage. All of the above are facts. Please publish this in your newspaper for correction. We will be very grateful. Respectfully, Dada Tobacco Factory. January 15, 20th year of the Republic of China."</p>

<p>Determined to Have Been Hit and Killed by a Car</p>
<p>Lu Guishi, an old woman from Dachang, who was sixty-two years old this year, came to Shanghai a few days ago to visit her nephew's wife, Lu Zhang, at No. 81 Dakang Li, Kangti Road, in the French Concession. At 1 PM on the 14th, she went out and was hit by a No. 730 truck from the Engineering Department of the French Municipal Council, driven by driver Wang Zhiliang, while walking through the Caishi Road area. The old woman was unable to avoid it and was knocked down, injuring her left leg. The patrol police saw this, recorded the license plate number, and sent the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment, and then reported back to the police chief for review. After Guishi was admitted to the hospital, the doctor found that her lower leg was severely injured and immediately amputated it in the hope of saving her life. However, it was still ineffective, and she died at 2 AM that night. The hospital notified the police station, who carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination. Yesterday, the Traffic Department summoned Lu Zhang, a relative of the deceased, and the defendant to the case, and reported to Judge Zhu of the French Public Court, who inspected the scene and confirmed that the deceased had indeed been hit and killed by a car before her death. He ordered photographs to be taken and allowed the family to prepare a coffin for collection.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Opening a Gambling Den and Matching Handwriting <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Xie Liansheng Has No Way to Deny</p>
<p>Fined and Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment</p>
<p>Xie Liansheng, a Ningbo native, was privately selling lamp black opium in a house at No. 1204 Hanbi Li Road. The day before yesterday afternoon, Western police chief Mr. Pan of the Traffic Department of the General Patrol Room secretly went with detectives and arrested Xie and opium smokers Tan Shaoqing, Shen Atian, Tang Longsheng, Lou Ada, Wang Qingji, and Tang Chunji, seizing opium paraphernalia and sutras. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xiao Xiefei proposed the case. Xie denied that the gambling den was set up by him, saying that he never smoked opium and would not open an opium den. None of the others admitted to being a seller of opium. Judge Xiao feared that someone would be wrongly released and ordered each defendant to write and compare handwriting with the seized sutras. Xie wrote "Pay 15 yuan," deliberately changing his handwriting. However, the written "yuan" character was mistakenly written with four strokes, and the "yuan" characters in the sutras were also all with four strokes. It was then determined that Xie was indeed the owner of the gambling den. At that time, Xie also lowered his head in silence. Therefore, he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 150 yuan. If he was unable to pay, he could commute two yuan to one day of imprisonment. Tang Chunji was found not guilty, and the others were sentenced to two months of imprisonment. The opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>

<p>Seizes Numerous Firearms</p>
<p>Zhang Zhaoxiang, leader of the detective team of the fourth district department of the Jiangsu Provincial Waterborne Public Security Team, received a confidential report from an informant some days ago, stating that a large group of fugitive bandits, including Li Jiangshi, who had escaped from No. 7 Nanfang Lane, were now hiding in house No. 4, Wengjia Sand, near Gaochang Temple, and that they had a large number of firearms stored there. He was asked to send officers to arrest them as soon as possible. Upon receiving the report, Captain Zhang, at approximately 11:00 PM the previous night, personally led detectives Xu Liang and others to the Gaochang Temple Second District General Station substation to report and request assistance. Patrol Chief Gao Hongbin ordered Patrolman Zou Tieshan and others to accompany them to Wengjia Sand. As expected, they arrested ten individuals, including the woman Li Jiangshi and Xue Wenxiang, in house No. 4. Under Jiangshi's bed, they found six Mauser rifles without bolts and one small-caliber rifle without a wooden stock, as well as nine incomplete bolts. They were immediately taken to the substation and transferred to the Second District General Station. After District Chief Wang interrogated them one by one, the woman Li Jiangshi confessed that she was 63 years old, from Anhui province, and very old. She claimed she did not know who had secretly abandoned the seized firearms under her bed. Xue Wenxiang confessed that he was 64 years old, from Nanjing, and worked in an arsenal. A man named Yang Wenting, 54 years old, from Hunan, who lived with Xue in Jiangshi's house, stated that they were both laborers in the arsenal and knew nothing about the hidden firearms. A man named Zhang Quanfa, 34 years old, from Anhui, worked as a laborer. A man named Wei Yongfa, 34 years old, from Anhui, also worked in the arsenal, residing at No. 50, Chengzhi Lane, behind the artillery factory. He claimed he was mistakenly arrested while out shopping near Xiaomu Bridge. A man named Xie Xirong, 56 years old, from Taoyuan, worked at the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Plant, residing at No. 3, Wengjia Sand. A man named Liu Weiting, 55 years old, from Hunan, worked at the steel mill. There was also a local woman named Gu Mao Yin, 27 years old, who worked as a sock knitter, all residing next door at No. 3. Two other individuals, Zhou Changan, 27 years old, from Xuzhou, residing at Xin Xin Lane, Dapu Bridge, Jin Shenfu Road, in the French Concession, currently worked as a chef at the Xin Xin Jingchuan Restaurant; and Wang Deyou, 22 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 2, Xing'an Lane, Guangdong Street, currently worked at a restaurant. Both claimed they were arrested together while passing through Xiaomu Bridge. After questioning, District Chief Wang considered the case to involve the private possession of firearms and immediately prepared a document to submit to the Judicial Section for investigation.</p>

<p>The Weisheng Steamship Collides and Damages Jardine Matheson's Weisheng Steamship. This time, coming from Guangdong to Shanghai, it encountered a severe storm with heavy snow. As the ship sailed near a lighthouse on the Shantou sea, it was late at night, and the wind and waves were particularly treacherous. The ship lost control, and its stern was hit by a huge wave near the lighthouse, striking against the reef. The stern hull was severely damaged. Fortunately, the engine was not damaged, so it was able to sail to Shanghai after the wind subsided. After arriving in Shanghai, it was immediately repaired and will be completed and ready to sail tomorrow. The cargo was not damaged, but the passengers were quite frightened.</p>

There are still ice floes below Huangdu. The small steamers that were blocked, the Suzhou line, arrived yesterday and will resume regular service on Saturday.

<h3 id="e133">Woolen Cloth Industry Requests Modification of New Tariff <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Highest Reaches 127% of Value</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Asks the Ministry of Finance to Find a Remedy</p>
<p>Fifty companies, including Jiufeng, Yida, Yikang, Chunhe Yong, Shixin, Huaxin, Fuchangxiang, Yukang, Xinchang, Shengchang, Huakang, Huasheng, Yuancheng, Yongchun, Heyong, Huashengxiang Yongfeng, Huafutai, Hengfeng, Qiafeng, Meilun, Dachangxiang, Rongchangxiang, and others, representatives of the woolen cloth industry in this city, believe that the newly established import tariff rates for woolen cloth are levied on a specific duty basis. Calculated as a percentage of price, the highest rate reaches 127% of the value, and even the lowest rate reaches 46%. This is a burden that woolen cloth merchants can hardly bear. After a meeting, they decided to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to forward the request for modification to the Ministry of Finance. The original letter stated: "Upon investigation, the third category of the new tariff, 'wool and its products,' has a maximum duty rate of 40%, but this is limited to carpets and rugs, as they are luxury items and thus taxed the most heavily in this category, unlike other items. The request from these merchants pertains to specific duties under items 97A and 97B, and the ad valorem duties under item 97C should not exceed 30%. It is presumed that the survey of commodity prices at the time was inaccurate, resulting in a tax rate of 127% for the highest category and 46.5% for the lowest category. The other categories are all above 90% or 60%, which is the highest tax rate in any category of the new tariff. Not only is it difficult for woolen cloth merchants to bear, but it also does not comply with the maximum tax rate limit of the new tariff. The merchants' request for modification is very justified. However, the procedure for revising commodity prices is complicated and cannot be completed in a short period. If the excessive tax burden on these merchants is not resolved immediately, their business will be difficult to maintain. Could the Ministry, by analogy with item 90C, temporarily instruct the customs to levy taxes according to market prices? The fundamental revision of these two items should then be thoroughly investigated and coordinated by the commodity price office. This is currently the only way to resolve the difficulties of the industry." In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward their difficulties, representatives of the woolen cloth industry were also elected to visit the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Customs Administration, and the Jianghai Customs Office to personally deliver petitions.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Ministry of Industry Appoints Sugar Inspection Technical Officer <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Director Cai of the Bureau of Standards, Metrology, and Inspection Concurrently Serves</p>
<p>Imported sugar products must undergo inspection. The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce promulgated regulations and ordered the Shanghai Bureau of Standards, Metrology, and Inspection to promptly plan for this. The Bureau believed that this inspection was a specialized undertaking that could not be handled without specialists. The Bureau's Chemical Inspection Department had only two senior technicians, and their workload was already heavy, making it difficult to handle additional tasks. Therefore, it was necessary to find specialists to take on the responsibility. Zhou Dayao, a Bachelor of Chemical Engineering from Purdue University in the United States and a Master of Sugar Engineering from Louisiana State University in the United States, and Wu Zhuo, a Bachelor of Chemical Engineering from the University of Ottawa in the United States and a Master of Sugar Engineering from Louisiana State University in the United States, both had profound knowledge and rich experience, having served as chemical technicians in British sugar factories. They are rare talents in China for sugar industry research. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry was requested to appoint them as technical officers for sugar product inspection at the Bureau to facilitate the work. In addition, in response to a previous telegram from the Ministry, Cai Wuji, the former Deputy Director of the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute of the former Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, was temporarily appointed as Deputy Director of the Bureau. Upon assuming his duties, it was found that the Bureau's Livestock and By-products Inspection Department urgently needed specialists. Deputy Director Cai graduated from the Grignon Agricultural School in France and the Alfort Veterinary School in France, obtaining degrees in agricultural technology and veterinary medicine. He has extensive knowledge and experience in veterinary medicine. Therefore, a request was made to appoint him concurrently as a technical officer in that department. Cai himself also expressed his agreement to use his expertise. The above three individuals have been approved and assigned to their respective positions.</p>

They have also sent a letter to the Zhabei Commercial Office and the Power Plant requesting the installation of electric lights and running water.</p>

<p>Ms. Chen Baoqin</p>
<p>My old friend Mr. Wang is from Sichuan. He took ill last year and returned home from school. Now he has recovered and is coming east again. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. It is a great joy to meet an old friend again. Last night I gave him a welcome dinner. During the dinner, I asked about the recent situation in Sichuan. Mr. Wang lamented the lawless behavior of the warlords. He was especially saddened by a story of a warlord pursuing a woman. I wrote it down.</p>
<p>A certain warlord was based in Chengdu. He did not know the arts. However, due to his high position, if he was considered ignorant, it would be disrespectful. Therefore, he asked his secretary to prepare a draft, and after reading it, he lectured everywhere to gain people's trust. One day, he lectured at a girls' school. He saw two beautiful students sitting side by side. Although the warlord had dozens of concubines, he could not help but be captivated. The thought of seeking a phoenix suddenly arose. He returned and discussed it with his subordinates. It happened that one of his concubines was also enrolled in the girls' school, so he knew that the two girls were sisters, the daughters of a wealthy family named Yang in Chengdu. He also learned that Yang had a hibiscus addiction, so he sent someone to arrest him. He was fined more than 100,000 taels of gold. The Yang family was caught in this dramatic change and had no way out. The two girls suddenly remembered that the warlord had a concubine who was their classmate, so they went to ask for help. The concubine was very enthusiastic in order to gain favor. However, she could not do anything herself, but she was willing to introduce the two girls to the warlord. The two girls were eager to save their father. Therefore, they went to see him in shame. The warlord pretended not to know and asked the two girls why they had come. The two girls told him everything. The warlord pretended to be angry and asked who had done it. He insisted on finding him. He ordered Yang's father to be released quickly and apologized to the two girls. He also treated them with great courtesy. He kept them for dinner and then sent them back. Yang's father, under this lascivious power, although he knew the tricks, did not dare not cooperate. After returning home, he set up a grand banquet to thank him for his kindness. The wine was delicious and the music was wonderful. The secretary asked to arrange a marriage. Yang's father pretended to agree. But please wait a few days to buy all the dowry. The warlord</p>

<p>·Bi·Ren</p>
<p>The Republic of Estonia is a small country along the Baltic Sea. Recently, a difficult legal issue arose. It has become an interesting story. According to the law of the country, anyone convicted of a capital crime has the right to choose their method of execution. There are two methods: taking poison or hanging. Recently, a prisoner sentenced to death volunteered to take poison. The executioner gave him the poison. The prisoner publicly swallowed it without fear. However, after taking the poison, he did not die. He only suffered from illness for a few weeks and then fully recovered. He became even more resistant to this type of poison. This made the country's authorities very embarrassed. According to the law, the amount of poison given to the prisoner is strictly regulated. It cannot be exceeded. If he is given it repeatedly, it is inhumane. The prisoner refused to be hanged. It is his right. Therefore, it is difficult to handle. It is likely that the prisoner will not die and will regain his freedom. In terms of law, the punishment he has received has been executed once.</p>
<p>thought so. He agreed to marry after a month. During this month, Yang's father sent people out to buy things to dispel his suspicions. When the auspicious day arrived, there was no movement. The warlord knew that he had been fooled. He conducted a large-scale search. The Yang family had disappeared. Although the warlord was furious, there was nothing he could do. After the Liu family arrived in Yixing, they sent a letter to the warlord and scolded him bitterly. It was a happy thing.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Anecdotes About the Four-Gilled Perch <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>

<p>Mr. Zhang Shileng (Zhang Xianghe) of my hometown, after becoming famous, held various official positions both inside and outside the country. He seemed to have forgotten the local flavor. After retiring and returning to his hometown, it happened to be the autumn and winter season. He imitated Zhang Jiying's desire to eat perch sashimi. He ordered the cook to buy it and cook it. The cook was from Jiangsu and did not know the method. He did not wash off the thin membrane on the skin and cooked it in the pot. After Mr. Zhang tasted it, he felt the flavor was ordinary and greasy. He said that he had not tasted the local flavor of his hometown for decades. Now that he finally had it, it was not as good as before. Could it be that the thing has changed? How confused was the old gentleman of poetry and wine! Zuo Wenxiang Gong Zongtang opened the government in Liangjiang and came to Songjiang for a great review. He heard that the four-gilled perch of Songjiang had a unique taste. He ordered his military officer to buy it and eat it. For a time, it was difficult to find. He bought the flower drum fish, commonly known as the carp fish, which was similar in shape but had no gills on its head and scales on its body. He gave it as a gift. The Gong did not know. When eating, his lips and cheeks salivated. He savored it with relish. After returning to the governor's office, he still talked about it happily with his colleagues, saying that it was a happy event in his life. How easy it is to deceive a gentleman!</p>
<p>Feng Haosou (Feng Menglao) of Jintan retired and lived in Shanghai. He learned when the delicious food of my hometown would be on the market. He took a car to Songjiang and bought more than a dozen perch to take away. He was overjoyed. But the cook he hired did not cook it properly. He fried it with soy sauce, wine, and vinegar instead of cooking it with pickled meat soup. Haosou ate it. It was greasy and tasteless, and the sour smell touched his nose. He said that the delicious food was not delicious. Why does the product of Songjiang have a false reputation? Alas, he blamed the product instead of the cook. Haosou's original name was true to his name. He failed this delicious food.</p>

<p>Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>On the ninth day of the first month of the twentieth year, the jade shavings were flying and the north wind was howling. The Shanghai China Art College opened its second exhibition of calligraphy and paintings at the Ningbo Fellow Association. I have a deep love for it. I went to see it despite the wind and snow to broaden my horizons. When I arrived, there were already more than a hundred people before me. Surrounded by them, I felt like I was in the city of the Jade Capital. The ten colors and five lights were dazzling. In addition to the works of teachers and students of the school, there were also many calligraphy and paintings by famous people. Such as Ma Xiangbo, Cai Yuanpei, Huang Ainong, Zheng Sucan, Wu Daiqiu, Yan Ganyuan, and Li Zuhang. Mr. Han and other gentlemen all have excellent works to participate in. I felt even more precious. The products of the teachers and students of the school amounted to more than 500 pieces. Ma Mengrong's wisteria and myna was titled. The wonderful sound breaks the moon, and the purple ribbon is colorful without the dawn wind. Mengrong's wisteria was previously appreciated by Watanabe Chenmu of Japan. This work is more refined than before. A frame of ink crabs imitates the style of the Yuan Dynasty. The brushstrokes are elegant and outstanding, just like his people. Other works, such as Qiuyuan Yiqu, are light and elegant, and full of poetic meaning. Several frames of autumn chrysanthemums also have their advantages. Mengrong once said that painting is valuable because of its natural interest. If you only copy, you will be a craftsman. This is true. Zhang Shanzhen has a frame of fierce tiger, titled. According to the strict downward view, take advantage of the situation and wait for the time. A humble gentleman, danger is like peace. Lifelike and real, it is a masterpiece. Zhang Daqian's crabapple was titled. Falling leaves rang Xing Lang, the west wind blows old goose side frost. No one leans on the stone fence in the middle of the night, leaving the remaining fireflies to illuminate the crabapple. There is also a frame of hibiscus, titled. The autumn water is clear, and the hibiscus is beautiful when it comes out of the water. She wants to pick it when she crosses the river. No, that beauty is far away. Other landscapes and other works are free and unique. It is a rare hand in modern times. Zhang Guangzhi's long scroll of hundreds of flowers is exquisitely detailed. Women can get this, which makes men ashamed. There are so many masterpieces that I can't describe them one by one. When I write this late at night, the scene at that time is still jumping in my mind.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Record of Deng Fen Weng's Book Carving Exhibition <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Du Juan</p>
<p>Deng Zi Fen Weng. I did not know him initially, but vaguely heard that he was as clear as fire and snow. Weng had been studying the arts since childhood, especially devoting himself to epigraphy and calligraphy. He was blessed with genius and complemented it with scholarly effort, deepening his attainments. However, Weng had an eccentric personality and did not conform to the world. He liked to use wine to dispel his feelings and also enjoyed traveling. He indulged in Chan Buddhist pleasure. Many famous mountains and forests in Jiangsu and Zhejiang bear his ink traces. I remember his five-character律詩 (lǜshī, a type of regulated verse) when I traveled to Hupao Temple years ago, saying: "Understanding Zhao Zhou's interest, hearing the ancient bell in the mountains. A lamp coldly faces the rain, a thousand gāthās (Buddhist verses) arise from sitting in the wind. The bone-piercing fragrance is exquisite, seeking the source of flowing water. There is no great medicine for longevity, the fragrant meaning fills the boundless." One can imagine his person from this. Weng recently exhibited his personal calligraphy and carvings at Jue Lin. I went to see it yesterday and saw the walls covered in splendid, clear scrolls. The six-foot stone drum screen does not use the meaning of Chang Shuo, but slightly imitates Zhao Yi Shu, possessing a distinct style. The seal script obtains Li Si's method, full of ancient charm. A small vertical axis in regular script, less than two feet, writes Li Bai's poem, revealing its ingenuity. The large couplets in official script have a powerful and vigorous spirit, directly seizing the seat of Yi Tingzhou. His cursive script has the momentum of a phoenix soaring and a dragon flying, seemingly from the method of Suo Shao Bao. I chose a four-foot couplet and will buy it to take home. The horizontal scrolls presented, made in large and small seal scripts, are especially outstanding. Weng is especially proficient in epigraphy. A hundred volumes of his printed catalogs were displayed in the hall, divided into two volumes, upper and lower, with vermilion seals on plain paper, dazzlingly brilliant. This is due to his deep understanding of the Qin and Han dynasties, and his vigorous wrist strength, creating a unique style.</p>

<p>(5) 6 Once Lived in Paris</p>
<p>Inside the cell of a condemned man, Tony Ska saw the ragged, feverish, trembling prisoner, who had no strength left to support himself before his execution. Tony Ska was deeply moved with compassion. She first tried to move him emotionally, and then gave him much encouragement. While the fierce executioner was waiting in the next room for the time to come to carry out the execution, Tony Ska made the condemned man play with the toys the small merchant had given her, making him as happy as a child. At dawn, the condemned man went to be executed. But he retained a most beautiful memory in his mind. The film reached this point, and I personally felt it should be silent. But the producers inserted a prayerful song here. I think this is the only flaw in the film. Sound films often have this defect.</p>
<p>When Tony Ska returned to the brothel, her sisters and the brothel's customers ridiculed her, calling her the "hangman's widow." Afterwards, everyone avoided her as an ominous object. Soon she was driven out of the brothel and had to wander the streets. Her nickname "hangman's widow" remained. She was often bullied on the streets.</p>
<p>One night she met her fiancé. Her fiancé took her back to the village to prepare for the wedding. The night before the wedding, her fiancé met friends who often gathered at a hotel. A small merchant told him, "I also know a woman named Tony Ska. This woman is very beautiful. Everyone calls her the 'hangman's widow.'" Then he told the story and produced Tony Ska's photo as proof. Tony Ska's fiancé, hearing this, immediately ran to denounce her severely. She fled from the insults of the entire village.</p>

<p>Seventeenth: Returning for Lasting Beauty, Rouge and Kohl Muddying the Eyebrows; Seeking Life Extension, a Golden Market for Swift Horses.</p>
<p>Let us say that Zuo Shi Chen hosted a party at Lü Yi's place. A female great person, Ren Pei Zhen, came to the banquet. Those present were also very welcoming to her. This welcome, in fact, was entirely out of curiosity. Everyone thought in their hearts that this female great person must be awe-inspiring and outstanding. They all wanted to see her to broaden their horizons. But when they saw her, they felt that she was no different from an ordinary lady. In conversation, she was very modest and did not adopt an intimidating posture. She was also very polite to the people in their room, not putting on airs at all. As they spoke about the previous organization of the women's revolutionary army, Ren Pei Zhen said, "Carrying that gun while walking really felt cumbersome. At first, I thought the weight of a gun was limited, only ten or twenty jin (a Chinese unit of weight) or so. But I realized that the more you carry it, the heavier it gets. The saying 'no light burden beyond a hundred steps' is true. I was fine because I naturally had unbound feet. But two of my sisters, their feet were 'enlarged feet,' swaying from side to side, how could they walk? After not even two li (a Chinese unit of distance), their faces were already flushed and they were short of breath. Later, we couldn't bear it, saying that not being able to walk was unavoidable, but their determination to join the army, this ambition, was truly admirable." Zuo Shi Chen said, "It was because at that time, regardless of men or women, everyone was of one mind, that the revolution succeeded in overthrowing the Manchu government. Actually, women don't necessarily have to join the army. There are many things that can be done in the rear, such as nursing wounded soldiers, measuring the clothes needed by soldiers. It's the same as contributing to the country. Why must they carry guns to the front? Even if they want guns, wouldn't it be much better to get a few lighter pistols?" Ren Pei Zhen laughed, "You really speak of peace too easily. At that time, it was already not easy to get a gun. How could you choose to pick the best pistols? A few pistols were not even enough for the officers to carry, how could they be popularized to so many people? Even for our women's revolutionary army, getting twenty guns was already very troublesome. They said, 'Your guns are just for show. Anyway, you may not go to the front line to fire, so it doesn't matter if they are subpar.' Just think about this sentence, wouldn't it infuriate people? It clearly scolds our women's revolutionary army, saying that anyway, they are just for show." Zuo Shi Chen said, "It's not quite like that. Physiologically speaking, the constitution of women is very different from that of men. In any country, women have no obligation to serve in the military. However, in revolutionary times, women were already citizens and of course aroused a sense of righteousness. In our history, there have been female generals, but few female soldiers. Because managing the camp may require knowledgeable and outstanding talents, but ultimately, charging into battle is not a woman's business." Ren Pei Zhen nodded and said, "So in the end, it was disbanded. Honestly, everyone also complained about enduring this hardship."</p>

<h3 id="e154">Financial Gold Rush Soars Again and Again <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Increase... Fourteen Taels and Four Mace</p>
<p>Strong Buying Pressure: Yesterday, the 15th, the gold price continued to rise sharply, soaring to great heights. It surged 15 taels, exceeding the 730-tael mark. Its state was still extremely chaotic. In a moment, there were dramatic changes of several taels. From morning to evening, there were a total of seventeen or eighteen taels of reviews, appearing complex and difficult to fathom. Almost all foreign exchange, both official and unofficial, was tight, and the exchange rate had already shrunk by two and a half gears. In the market, the buying enthusiasm of various brokers was constant, such as Zhen Chang Xiang, Xin Heng, Tai Kang Run, and Fu Chang, major players who all made purchases. The Dalian gang and Yuan Xing Yong, as well as small investors, had already sold. Overseas silver markets saw a severe fall, but the gold price initially opened with a slight increase, mainly because American purchases and sales were divergent, especially with talk of rescuing the silver shortage. Therefore, people in the industry were hesitant. Afterwards, buyers displayed agility, and the market situation soared into the clouds, rising more than ten taels sharply. Again, with abundant capital, it turned downward rapidly, falling sharply by more than ten taels. Rising and falling without a market, the situation was stormy and difficult to suppress. At noon, the buying side showed enthusiasm again, and it has now risen back by eight or nine taels. In the later market, the Indian exchange rate reported low, and bills of exchange were also tight, suddenly reaching 737 taels and some change. Buying on the floor exceeded selling, and then the waves surged, rising and falling suddenly.</p>
<p>Forward Hedging: Forward hedging has already been opened among colleagues, with most offering six to four and a half taels. It also calculated five taels. The trading volume was still crowded. Companies such as Tai Kang Run, Da De Cheng, Wan Xing, and various other firms have posted offers, while Fu Chang, Yu Feng, and Yong, etc. (home heads) have made advances. According to the exchange's regulations, hedging must be done by the 16th. However, recently, various firms have been eager to open positions, one day early. The exchange authorities also have no way to stop it. Afterwards, with the market price at 733 taels, it is said that large orders may continue to fall this morning.</p>
<p>Rapid Advances and Retreats: In the morning, the February opening price rose slightly by one tael and two mace, to 719 taels and eight mace. (The gross margin was over 21 taels, up to within 20, with many sellers.) Afterwards, Fu Chang, Tai Kang, Run, Zhen Chang Xiang, Heng Xing, etc. bought quite a bit, to the point that large orders plummeted by 16/13. The silver price also dropped by 1.375 points. Private telegraphs were the same. At 9:15, it had risen to 31 taels. Before long, Tai Heng, Yuan, Da De Cheng, etc. sold, falling back by four taels, calculated at around 27 taels. However, the foreign exchange market was still strong. HSBC absorbed March British gold at 1/3.5. Afterwards, various banks mutually traded at 1/3.375. Mitsui absorbed the spot Dalian at 1.58 taels. Almost the first order announced was from 28 taels to 27 taels and change. Although the listed exchange rate shrank by .625, with American gold at 1.25 yuan, and Japanese gold adding 6.375 points, it was not moved. The market price was flat, calculated at 27.5 taels to 26.5 taels, which was in fact pre-raised. In a moment, physical goods traders and Bing Xing, etc. came in, jumping seven or eight taels, calculated at 24.8 taels. However, bills of exchange stood still. In a blink, British gold was at 1/3.437 to 375. Banks could do business in and out. In addition, Yuan Cheng Heng Yu and various firms on the floor also sold off, so the price frequently fell without end. From 10:00 to 10:45, it plummeted by 11 or 12 taels. In between, rising and falling by two or three taels was nothing strange. By 11:50, it was only calculated at 22.5 taels. Afterwards, Cui, Tai, Da De Cheng, Xin Heng, etc. had all begun to buy. In half an hour, it rose six taels. At 11:20, it was at 28.5 taels. Suddenly, it was suppressed to 25 taels. When the market closed at noon, it was at 27 taels. The scale of the change was difficult to handle. At this time, Xin Heng, etc. suddenly competed to buy again. After the market closed, it was raised to 31.5 taels. The announced price had been changed to 779 taels and four mace, which is a daily gold hanging of 6.375 points, calculated at pressing 52-3 taels to 45 taels, 又 56-7 taels. Noon closing was 52 taels.</p>
<p>Tense Ending: The afternoon market opened and immediately rose five or six taels, to 37 taels (the gross margin was from 33-4 taels to over 7 taels). Subsequently, it was at 37.5 taels, and suddenly it had retreated to 33 taels. The market was unstable. The Indian exchange rate telegraphed a small thirteen anna. It was seen again at 37.5 taels. However, forward hedging had already been opened unofficially on the floor, and there were many sellers. The British gold, China Bank such as Shanghai and He Feng, etc. sold, totaling 1/3.25 in March. Subsequently, Mitsui put out 3/1.25 in May, so the gold price fell seven or eight taels. At 3:00, it was at 29.5 taels. Physical goods traders took this opportunity to buy in, calculated at ten minutes, rising six or seven taels sharply, calculated at 36 taels. Tai Xing, etc. sold, suddenly falling by more than five taels. At 3:45, it was 34 taels and five mace. Again, the retail investors supplemented their positions, and foreign exchange was still good. The March British gold settled at 1/3.3125, so at around 4:00, it was calculated at 34 taels. At one point, it retreated to 31 taels. Heng Xing, Tai Heng Yuan, Ying Feng Yong, etc. came in. At 4:10, it was still at 33.6 taels, and then it decreased by one tael, to 31 taels. At 4:30, the market closed at 33 taels, a further increase of 14.4 taels compared to the day before (in the past two days, it increased by 38 taels). The highest price in a day was 737.5 taels, the lowest price was 719.8 taels, an difference of 17.7 taels. Physical goods traders opened at 20 taels in the morning, closed at 28 taels at noon, 27.5 taels in the afternoon, and closed the market at 32 taels. The announced price was calculated at pressing 46-7 taels. Morning accounting was 27 taels, afternoon accounting was 23 taels, water supplement was 24 taels, afternoon 30 taels. Dalian withdrew many peer-to-peer transactions. Tai Kang Run, Heng Xing, Xin Heng, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Yu Tai, Fu Chang, Zhen Chang Xiang, and Bing Xing all made advances. Wan Xing, Shun Li, Yuan Xing Yong, and Da De Cheng all exited. Yuan Tai, Zhi Feng Yong, and Yuan Cheng, etc. had many imports and exports. In the afternoon, Zhi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Hui Xiang, Shun Li, and physical goods traders, etc. had varying entries and exits. Wan Xing, Yuan Cheng, Da Xing, etc. sold. Tai Kang Run, Heng Xing, Heng Yu, and Ying Feng Yong all made advances. The Dalian gang sold 4,000 taels in total, and advanced over 2,000 taels. The bulls sold off. The Guangdong gang slightly advanced, it is said.</p>

<p>Being Continuously Affected by Foreign Exchange Changes, Foreign Exchange Foreign Merchant Banks Suffered the Most Damage. The Economic Adjustment of Our Chinese Merchant Financial Circles is Like a Piece of Boat in a Frightening Wave, and the Captain's Hold Is a Proper Way. This Time the Lunar New Year Has Just Passed, and the Customary Qingli Lunar New Year Is Approaching in the Blink of an Eye. General Commerce Has No Special Opportunity to Develop, and It Is Quite Difficult to Wind Up. According to people in the financial industry, the current time to end the books is only one month away. Most of the overdue items have not been initiated. Banks that do foreign exchange or operate on behalf of customers are mostly at a loss. According to the past results of the money shop's collection of outstanding funds, the recovery rate is not even 10-20%. If it is in this port, we can try our best to find ways to promote the industry, but in foreign ports, it is often beyond our reach, and it is difficult to repay on time. Therefore, at present, in the money industry, engaging in collection procedures is exceptionally busy. The bank's own money supply has gradually become abundant, but there is no place to settle it. Therefore, the money supply is now gradually falling again.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the bond market futures were as quiet as before. Sales were sporadic. The total volume traded in the forward and spot markets was 5,185,000 yuan. Among them, the 1928 Customs bonds accounted for over 1,300,000 yuan, the Rehabilitation bonds 1,080,000 yuan, the Troop Reduction and Reorganization bonds, and the 1936 bonds only 6-700,000 yuan each. Other bonds were as quiet as before. In addition, spot market transactions suddenly increased, with Troop Reduction bonds reaching about 70,000 yuan, and Troop Reorganization bonds and 1928 Customs bonds exceeding 10,000 yuan each. However, other bonds remained inactive, totaling 96,000 yuan. As for the trend of bond prices, due to the quiet environment of the bond market and lack of any development, bond prices continued to be extremely stable. The daily fluctuations were minimal. The spot and futures prices of Troop Reduction, 1928 Customs bonds, and 1928 Secured Customs bonds rose slightly, while other bonds slightly declined.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Distant Futures of Cotton Yarn Industry: External Observers' Perspective <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains firm, with actual sales still sluggish. Dealers from various regions maintain a neutral attitude. However, a shipment to Chongqing, Sichuan, bought 3-400 bales. There are no other signs of excitement. Therefore, people's sentiments are still stable. However, the situation is quite tight, as the bulls' pulling power is very strong and shows no sign of loosening. Recently, one manufacturer has settled, which has eased the market atmosphere. External observers are consistently bullish about the distant futures. The future prospects will depend on actual sales.</p>
<p>The Marked-Price Standard is Stable and Correct. At the opening of the marked-price market, the buying interest was very strong, with near-term prices rising 5-6 qian, and distant prices rising 3-4 qian. The second session was slightly weaker, falling 1-2 qian. The market closed strong again, resulting in price changes of 2, 3, and 6 qian across different months. In the afternoon, due to the return of adulterated Three-Grade Yarn and the continued rise in gold prices, the market atmosphere rose again, resulting in near-term prices falling 6 qian and distant prices rising 1, 2, and 5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 45,850 bales. The sales records showed that Yongchang sold 2,000 bales, Rongxing 1,700 bales, Hengde 1,700 bales, Yixu 1,000 bales, Hengchang 1,150 bales, and the rest sold 6, 7, and 800 bales each. The purchases records showed that Changfeng bought 1,900 bales, Guangdong 1,600 bales, Dafeng 900 bales, and the rest bought 5, 6, 7, and 800 bales each. The closing prices are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Marked-Price Closing Prices, Changes, and Account Balance</p>
<p>January 15.03 Down 3 32,050 April 15.33 Down 1 64,950</p>

<p>March 15.20 571,900 June 15.48 2 29,500</p>
<p>Yarn Sales are More Active. Yarn sales are relatively better. The statistics for the entire day show that dealers from various regions bought a total of 1,100 bales. The market is firm. Among the out-of-town dealers, Sichuan bought 450 bales, Shantou bought 25 bales, Fujian bought 90 bales, Xiamen bought 65 bales, the interior bought 110 bales, Jiangxi bought 220 bales, Luzhou bought 30 bales, and miscellaneous dealers bought 65 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Bullish Sentiment is Strong in the Cotton Market <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market remains firm. The overseas cotton market is mediocre. However, gold prices are trending higher, and exchange rates are shrinking significantly, leading to high silver prices for foreign cotton. Therefore, the bullish sentiment is strong, and the pulling power is becoming tighter. Although spot cotton business is slow, those holding goods are very keen on hoarding, so the situation feels particularly tight. However, Hengde and Gongtai settled 2-30,000 dan of American cotton.</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent Shanghai Standard British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent Shanghai Standard.</p>
<p>There are quite a few buyers. Gengfeng purchased 12,700 dan. The future of the cotton market will depend on the fluctuation of exchange rates.</p>
<p>The Han Standard is Strong and Rising. At the opening of the Han standard market, with the price of foreign cotton being average and gold prices rising again, the buying interest in the market was high, with prices rising from 1 qian to 5 fen across the board. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere remained high. Later, due to selling by the bulls, the market situation eased slightly. The result was near-term prices being flat and distant prices rising 5 fen to 1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 100,5,200 dan. The purchase records showed that Gengfeng bought 12,300 dan, Ji 3,400 dan, Changfeng 4,200 dan, Tianchang 4,300 dan, Shenxin 3,900 dan, and the rest bought 2-3,000 dan. The sales records showed that Gongtai sold 8,400 dan, Hengde 17,500 dan, and the rest sold 2-3,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Spot Cotton is Hoarded. Although spot cotton transactions are slow, with gold prices trending higher, sellers are keen on hoarding. 618 bales of Yao cotton and over 600 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived at the docks. The sales prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Fine Lint Cotton, 36.75, Tongxing Factory purchased 1,00 pieces, spot delivery to the factory.</p>

<p>American Cotton is Calm and Firm. Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm and firm due to short covering purchases in New Orleans and a decrease in sellers. Futures prices rose 1-4 points, and spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose 2 points, and spot prices rose 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 5 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with speculators buying. Pingguor rose 2 rupees, distant futures rose 1 rupee, Aomula near and distant futures rose 1 rupee, and Bairoxi rose 3 rupees.

<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the total number of sources arriving from various regions was around 20. Buying interest in the local market has become sluggish. Northern japonica rice has fallen back by 2 jiao, but special japonica rice is still around 14 yuan. Ordinary transactions are dull and the market is stagnant. The overall trend is quite soft. Thin early rice, upon inspection, seemed level, showing a slight jiao. Foreign indica rice sales are still acceptable, with sources arriving successively, and prices dropping nearly 1 chi. The markets for Du-tipped and Bu-tipped rice are uninspired, but as goods are scarce, the market is stable. Bian-Yuan and Diao-Wei rice shops are not deserted, and prices are uniquely stable. Yin-Yuan rice is stagnant and spiritless, but the owners are unwilling to sell at lower prices. The overall situation is one of flatness.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, there were not many sources arriving from the river. Market sales were mediocre. Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongzhou japonica rice have mostly been stagnant and fatigued by half a jiao. This is truly because of sluggish sales in both urban and rural areas. Although there is a small demand for early thin rice from the Southern regions, there are still bottom goods. After dark, the number of shipments gradually increased, and the market went from stable to fatigued. Yang Du and various tipped rice varieties also felt a shift towards laxity. There were few transactions between the two sides. The market top barely opened at 12 yuan and 2 jiao, which was level with the previous day. The arrival and sales of Bian Yin-Yuan rice were both sluggish, with no changes for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Jiangxi Late Rice Sales are Active and Continue to Rise <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Ningxiang Indica Rice Alone Trends Weak.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for out-of-town indica rice: Jiangxi and Nanjing routes both continued to arrive, but the number of arrivals was not large, and they were scattered small orders. Jiangxi rice was being sought after in the local market. Yesterday, Guangdong merchants continued to try to buy, with prices for high and low grades all rising nearly one jiao. Over 3,000 bags of late-harvest machine-milled rice were offered throughout the market, with prices ranging from 11 yuan and 7 jiao to 11 yuan. Although Nanjing rice continued to arrive, local customers did not welcome it. Yesterday, the local market accommodated only 250 bags, with the price initially opening at 10 yuan, then falling to 9 yuan and 9 jiao. Mid-grade goods still need to be discounted. It will be difficult to open high-grade goods above 10 yuan in the future. Market prices are about 1 jiao lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Flour and Wheat Market Initially Lively, Then Flat <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Widespread Rumors That Factories Will Continue to Order 20,000 Tons of Australian Wheat</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a pattern of being lively initially, then flat in the afternoon. In the morning, with positive reports about foreign wheat and continued increases in the gold market, the atmosphere in the market for each month was quite tense, about 3-4 fen better than the previous day's closing price. Until the opening of the afternoon session, with the flour market slightly soft and the previously rumored continuation of orders for Australian wheat by factories at over 20,000 tons, selling became smoother, and the market fell back. Looking at the situation in the future, if there are any further changes abroad, the market situation will inevitably change. As a result, the current month was 1 fen better than the previous day, February was down 1 fen, March was down 1 fen, April was unchanged, May was down 1 fen, and June's new wheat had not traded smoothly, with prices slightly less than expected.</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market atmosphere for each month improved by 1-2 jiao due to better prices for foreign wheat, and benchmark gold prices soared again. People inside and outside the industry could not help but turn, and the market prices for each month rose about 1 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. Until the opening of the afternoon session, with gold prices slightly softer, people's sentiments softened again, and although there were few sellers on the market, the market loosened again. As a result, there was no change in January and February, March was up 2.5 li, April was up 5 li, May was up 7.5 li, and June was up 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Standard Futures Soybeans Rise Nearly 1 Qian <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Soybean Cake Futures Also Rise Accordingly</p>
<p>Soybeans: Yesterday, the soybean market was firm due to the tight and rising reports from Dalian the previous day and a small number of short coverings in the morning. Each term rose by as much as 0.5 to 1 qian. The March term reached 4 taels and 6 qian, and people's sentiments were very good. After the opening of the afternoon session, out-of-town merchants suddenly sold off, but fortunately, the buying interest was still not weak, and benchmark gold prices fluctuated, so it only flattened slightly. As a result, it was 4 fen higher than the previous day for the January term, 6 fen higher for the February term, 7 fen higher for the March term, 9 fen higher for the April term, and 8 fen higher for the May term.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: Yesterday, the cake market opened exceptionally well, with strong buying interest from all sides. The board uniformly rose by about 2 fen. Until the opening of the afternoon session, due to the weakening of the soybean situation and the slightly selling by oil factories and the selling by Dalian merchants, it turned slightly lower by nearly 1 fen. As a result, March was up 1.25 fen, April was up 2 fen, May was up 2.25 fen, and June was up 1.5 fen.</p>

<p>Xiamen Sun-Dried Pork: Recently, due to a long-term lack of supply and thin reserves, and with the prices of miscellaneous goods rising frequently, the situation is very tight. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived in port with 4-50 boxes, the goods were still red and the color was good, and more than half were immediately released from customs, the price rising by 20 taels compared to before.</p>

<p>Top-Grade Shark Fins are Out of Stock</p>
<p>The Guang belly that previously arrived had already been sold out. It was not until recently that a small number arrived, but it coincided with a strong buying interest from various regions, resulting in insufficient supply. The market rose again and again. Yesterday, the offered prices were 308 taels for three boxes of top-grade belly, 286 taels for one box of large-face belly, and 257.5 taels for three boxes of two-face belly, which is a huge increase of 6-70 taels per grade compared to last year. And the merchants, regardless of the high prices, still want to buy, and the tightness of the market can be described as unparalleled.</p>
<p>Top-grade shark fins such as dragon beard and phoenix tail are all out of stock. There is also not much in the lower-middle grade street stocks. Merchants are peddling Jinshan top-grade fins for 480 taels, large-grade fins for 400 taels, 360-370 taels, medium-grade fins for 320 taels, and small-grade fins for 230-240 taels. Merchants from Hunan and Hubei have made purchases.</p>

<p>Yesterday, telegrams from European and American factory agents continued to arrive in Shanghai. Due to limited raw materials and high costs, the factory side is adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, only Taihe, etc., imported 50 bales of white factory silk to Shanghai, and Suichang imported 40 bales of yellow factory silk to Sichuan, all at firmly rising prices.</p>

<p>The Wuxi silk factory industry was sluggish in silk sales last winter, and all silk factories traditionally took a holiday at the end of the year. Since the beginning of the year, the sales of European and American factory agents have been very strong, and silk prices have soared. In addition, the government silk factory bond issuance is imminent, so various silk factories have resumed operations separately after the 5th. Among the 50+ silk factories in the county, 40 have already resumed operations, and the rest will also find ways to resume operations within the next few days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign firms in the local tea market, the Zhenmei aged teas from Tunxi, Suian, and other routes, as well as Qiahe, Tongfu, Yongxing and other firms, were still making every effort to search and buy due to low tea prices. The total transaction volume throughout the city was over 1,400 boxes, and the selling prices remained unchanged. Huang Xiyi, Bai and Zhuang Fulin Foreign Firm, also had many [transactions]. Prices opened at 21-22 [yuan]. The current inventory in the market is only over 30,000 boxes, and people's sentiments are stable. However, various European firms are still determined not to [buy] unless the price is low, and it is difficult to expect tea prices to return to high levels.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the new tariff, the prices of woolens have been rising steadily. All light goods such as beiges, genuine tribute flannel, Walter cloth, and all woolen fabrics must be calculated according to weight. Those weighing no more than 6 English ounces per square [yard] must be taxed 280 gold yuan per dan. Those weighing between 6 and 12 English ounces [yard] are taxed 250 gold yuan, which is 2-3 times higher than the old tax. Therefore, the industry has decided to temporarily raise prices by about 30%, but they still feel that the price is too expensive and the volume of sales is low, resulting in a distinction between official and unofficial prices. However, those who need it urgently will sell at temporary price increases. It can truly be said that morning and evening prices are different, with the idea that prices change three times a day. Therefore, the recent selling prices of woolens have no standards, and the speed of change is the same as the wild ups and downs of the benchmark gold market.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Coal: Fushun Coal Dust Spot Goods Sold Out <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Fushun coal dust, a major fuel for factories, has recently seen a sharp decline in imports, resulting in a severe shortage of spot goods and soaring prices. Although various factories and coal dealers have tried their best to search for it, as of yesterday, there were no spot goods sold on the market. There are occasional futures transactions, but they are mostly for selling short. [Foreign] firm orders have generally not been sold recently, and no new goods have been shipped. Yesterday's market offer price had reached 12 taels and 5 qian per ton.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Oil Market: Asphalt Nearing Close <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The asphalt market has been unstable in recent months. Due to a poor harvest the previous year, the reserves on the Han River in the late autumn were very thin, with only 2-3,000 pieces stored throughout the market. However, Shanghai merchants had more reserves than the Han market, reaching 8-9,000 pieces, preparing for the autumn oil extraction. However, soap factories did not process it, and oil extraction was also slow. By the winter, new goods had appeared in the production area, and Shanghai merchants still had 5-6,000 pieces in stock. As a result, they became wary and had to sell at lower prices. The price of Chong Jing asphalt fell from 22 taels to 20 taels, but the price on the Han market was still 18 taels. The decline in Shanghai's price can be said to be meaningless. Therefore, after the new goods entered the market, merchants, due to unsold inventory, all stood by and watched. However, the arrival of oil from Taizhou, Zhejiang, forced the opening of the market. The initial opening price was around 19 taels. To date, more than 1,000 dan have arrived. The recent price has opened at 18 taels due to a slight decline in the Han market, but because the quality of Taizhou oil varies, the price cannot be considered standard. According to yesterday's telegram from the Han market, the price of front-row Macheng oil has fallen to 14 taels and 8 qian, and the price of back-row goods is 14 taels and 6 qian, but considering that it was still 18 taels half a month ago, it has also fallen sharply. And the price of branded Chong Jing, according to the previous letter from the Han market, has also fallen to 16 taels [per dan]. After this decline, the market may stabilize, and the price decline in the local market should be able to stabilize. However, it is said that the sales of Youxi, Neiping, Benche, and other oils from Zhejiang have been high since their release, so they may not depreciate with the Han market. However, the sales volume of candle [and tallow] in the winter was far less than in previous years. Although the reserves are thin, how can we clear sales? We must also worry about that.</p>

<p>Yang Yanhe</p>
<p>To Mr. Fu Zongyi: Your illness belongs to the category of flaccidity. The "Ling Shu Jing Mai Pian" (Classic of Spiritual Pivot, Meridians) says, "Deficiency causes flaccidity, unable to sit and rise." However, your letter is brief, and details regarding your appetite, bowel movements, presence of pain, accompanying symptoms, and age are not mentioned. Thus, a diagnosis is impossible. Upon examination, flaccidity has various types: tendon flaccidity, summer flaccidity, pulse flaccidity, heat flaccidity, muscle flaccidity, spleen deficiency flaccidity, spleen excess flaccidity, skin and hair flaccidity, bone flaccidity, damp-heat flaccidity, damp fatigue flaccidity, qi deficiency flaccidity, yin deficiency flaccidity, blood deficiency flaccidity, blood stasis flaccidity, qi deficiency with fatigue flaccidity, qi and blood deficiency flaccidity, kidney and liver deficiency flaccidity, food stagnation flaccidity, and so on. It cannot be determined arbitrarily. There is a single prescription that you may try. Take two chestnuts that are flat on both sides; those flat on one side and round on the other are useless. Place them at the head of your bed before going to sleep. Before dawn, before speaking, first take one, chew it in bed with your lips closed, chew it until it melts like a paste, and swallow it in three gulps, mentally guiding it to the dantian (lower abdomen). Then, take another one and chew and swallow it as before. After eating, sleep soundly. Do this every day. After half a month, if it is effective, you can stop taking the medicine. Recovery may occur within a hundred days.</p>
<p>To Mr. Huan Tang: Unsatisfactory coughing and phlegm: dry phlegm belongs to the lungs, salty taste belongs to the kidneys, and substantial texture belongs to the spleen. Speculating from this, the lungs, spleen, and kidneys are all diseased. However, your letter does not clearly state your body type (fat or thin), age, changes in appetite, bowel regularity, sleep quality, or any accompanying symptoms. Moreover, coughing as a disease has various types: heart cough, liver cough, spleen cough, lung cough, kidney cough, stomach cough, gallbladder cough, large intestine cough, small intestine cough, bladder cough, triple burner cough, pericardium cough, dry cough, hot cough, morning cough, sleep cough, before noon cough, afternoon cough, five-watch cough (early morning), less cough in the day and more at night, and so on. It cannot be treated carelessly. However, for a long-term cough, a single prescription involves using aged jellyfish skin, thoroughly rinsed, mixed with rock sugar, steamed, and eaten. Another prescription involves one pig lung, two qian (approx. 7.5 grams) of Sichuan yuan powder, three qian of baked ginger, and two fen (approx. 0.75 grams) of ephedra. Simmer it lightly in clear water and eat it. Eating it several times consecutively is effective.</p>
<p>To Mr. Dai Zhongfan: The fundamental treatment for this dizziness should be to tonify the liver and kidneys, which is essentially the same as the Western method of nourishing the brain, and may even be more effective. Your brain nerves were injured from a fall at the age of three. Nourishing the kidneys will nourish the brain because the brain is connected to the spinal cord within the kidneys. Its origin lies in the deficiency of the liver body and excess of liver function, causing upward rebellion towards the stomach. It must be that dizziness and vomiting occur upon rising, and the vomiting subsides and the dizziness reduces when lying down. Each episode requires several days of quiet sleep to recover. If the symptoms are as described, then the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill) should be the main treatment, with adjustments. If your body type is fat and fair, it is appropriate to combine clearing fire, resolving phlegm, and tonifying qi. If your body type is dark and thin, it is appropriate to combine nourishing yin, reducing fire, and calming the liver. As for the folk remedy, find glutinous rice flour from seven different families, (except those with the same surname), from each province, and save it for the Qingming Festival. In advance, pick tender willow shoots (the light yellow buds growing in the willow branches), one for each year of age, totaling twelve. Use the aforementioned rice flour to wrap small yuanxiao (glutinous rice balls), using the willow shoots as filling. Have him sit on the doorstep, facing inside the house, and eat them on the morning of Qingming Festival. Perhaps this can eliminate the root of the problem.</p>
<p>To Mr. Wang Weifeng: I am not skilled in surgery and cannot offer assistance. Please consult with Dr. Zhang Zanchen at 503 Xiyangguan Lane, Xizang Road. Dr. Zhang not only has a family tradition in internal and external medicine but also cares deeply for his patients. I hereby introduce you to him.</p>
<p>(Note) For those seeking medical advice, please send letters directly to Dr. Yang's clinic at No. 80 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road. I will reply with a special letter. This publication will not receive letters on my behalf.</p>

<p>Sincere Company announces: In order to treat customers well, taking advantage of this severely cold weather, a major sale of various coarse and fine furs is being offered. For example, each yellow fox scarf is only sold for twelve to sixteen yuan, sea otter fur for twenty-five to thirty-five yuan, and other items such as fox-trimmed gray squirrel and various types of lambskin are priced even cheaper than usual.</p>
<p>The Sanyou Industrial Society on Nanjing Road announces: The narcissus flowers given away by our company last year were greatly cherished by the ladies and gentlemen of society. This year's varieties are even better. Starting today, for every purchase of three yuan or more at the north and south branches, one pot will be given away. Purchases of larger quantities will be given away proportionately.</p>
