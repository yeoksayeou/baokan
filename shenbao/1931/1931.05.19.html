<h3>命運所繫</h3>
<p>意國報載意相墨索里尼簽名一文。論殖民問題。謂歡戰終結後。意國開拓之疆土。不値介意。惟此泛繫主義。已積極發展。此後更當向外張播。人人以此爲命運所繫之信仰云云。夫世界無論何種問題。凡非安危存亡所關者。皆可讓步。獨此關係安危存亡之命運問題。則必出全力以赴之而不肯稍讓。各認爲命運所繫而不相讓。此歐洲戰禍之所由作也。今者意旣以泛繫主義爲命運所繫。而歐洲其他各國。爲各欲擺脫經濟上之難局。亦認經濟爲命運所繫之問題。德法代表在國聯委員會中之大論戰。即以稅約問題之有關命運也。會中北歐各國代表。如荷丹瑞挪芬蘭諸國。對於某項經濟問題。開會决議一致行動。則以某項經濟爲北歐各國命運所繫也。匈牙利京城二十萬民衆大會。匈意保斯等代表一致要求修改特里亞朗條約。勢甚激昻。則以該條約爲匈意保斯諸族人命運所繫也。此外蘇聯之所以急急進行五年新經濟計劃者。亦以新經濟計劃爲蘇聯命運所繫。而凡與此項計劃利害有衝突之國。又必認爲肖妨己國命運而力謀應付。從可知此種命運有關之問題。會議鮮效。調解無益。此後不幸而再有大戰發生者。其必在此世界有數之命運問題歟。</p>

<p>肺癆必死說與肺病新療法</p>
<h3>由德國肺結核雜誌抄譯</h3>
<p>（一）肺癆必死說之由來</p>
<p>世間流行之疾病雖多。然醫療之難。瀰蔓之廣。未有如肺結核（卽肺癆病）者。肺結核之侵害吾人。隨時隨地。無有間斷。爲害人最深殺人最多之傳染病。吾人所最恐怖者也。伊古以來。斷定肺癆爲必死病。良以罹之之後。實難療治。故醫士遇之。束手無策。患者遇之。心驚膽落。日有短命之憂而已矣。及到近代。醫學進步。名醫輩出。精密研究。始知肺結核實非必死之絶症。如療養得法。初期中治愈者。十之八九。卽歷二三期者。亦有就痊之希望。惟罹病過久。旣達最後末期之患者。無療救之法。然罹病甚久。以致不能療治者。不獨肺結核爲然。願罹此病者。於其初中期。愼毋怠忽。療養可也。</p>
<h3>（二）肺癆病原菌之發現</h3>
<p>自古以來。中西醫界。就肺癆之病原體。曾有許多種種之空論臆說。均暗黑不明矣。最近有德國細菌學大家考克博士。發見結核菌爲肺癆病之原因。破此千萬古黑暗。而發一線之大光明。彼虎列拉菌爲虎列拉病之原因。白喉菌爲白喉病菌之原因。赤痢菌爲赤痢病之原因。其他若梅毒之發生。基於梅毒菌。癩病之發生。亦基於癩菌。諒爲舉世共知。肺結核亦然。其發生之原因。基於結核菌。此菌最喜侵襲人類。其棲息系殖。大抵在吾人之肺臟中。人類之被其害者。不可勝算。往時占世界人口七分之一。近代占六分之一。都市則達五分之一。實爲流行最廣之傳染病也。</p>
<h3>（三）肺病者之二大恩人</h3>
<p>（一）德國考克博士</p>
<p>一八四三年。生於德國葛勞司城。家可小康。故幼年安心向學。中學卒業後。歷入國中諸大學。研究醫藥爲。年未三十。卽發明　之細菌。國中名醫。爲之傾倒。越數載。於一八八二年三月二十四日。考克博士。乃以研究發明之肺結核菌。發表於德京柏林生理學大會席上。當時各國醫學界。爲之震動。德國政府。嘉其精學。任考克博士爲衞生院院長。各國帝王。又贈高等勳草。各國大學。爭以名譽學位寄贈。一九零五年。諾伯爾醫學巨奬。亦及考氏。可謂極學界之尊榮。今之醫治肺癆者。無不基於考氏之發明。其有功於救人濟世。誠世界人類之所當感謝者也。</p>
<h3>（二）德國柏格爾博士</h3>
<p>自考克博士發見結核菌爲肺結核之病原體以來。東西結核學者。爭先研究。欲期得一殺滅此菌之妙方。但其結果。盡歸失敗。蓋歷求一般醫家。因未明瞭肺結核菌之别具一種特殊性搆造。自柏格爾博士。苦心研究後。始發見肺結核菌。有一種特殊之防禦力。能抵抗一切外來藥力之攻擊。蓋結核菌體。係中性脂肪之内膜及抗酸性蠟質之外膜所搆成。若非設法破壞其蠟質之防線及解除其脂肪性之武裝。則無由俘擒結核菌。而置之死地。因此我普天下肺病者之大恩師格柏爾博士。搜集一切動植礦物性各種藥物。而苦心研究。孜孜數十年。不知絞盡幾許腦汁。瀝盡幾許心血。最近終發明特殊動物之腸間膜腺壓縮汁中。有一特種有效成分。對於結核菌。有强力脫蠟之作用。此實前後千古醫學界一大疑問的肺結核根本療法之大成功也。</p>
<p>德國納得博士製</p>
<h3>肺内動脈及氣管支分布圖</h3>
<p>第八十一圖</p>
<p>（四）肺結核之特効療法</p>
<p>蓋肺結核（卽肺癆）之原因是結核菌，而此菌一入人體内，則於該處，便成結節以斷血行之路，又結核菌能分不泌一種抗酸性蠟質，包圍其體，以防禦一切外來藥力之侵入。故雖用種種殺菌藥，内服或注射，終不能達其病菌之實體内，歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法，對症療法，理學的療法，血清療法，藥劑療法，及其他一切治療法等，尙未完全成功，而肺病無藥之說，徧滿於一世者，因未知此深奥學理故耳，由此現代結核學者，根據上述之學理，繼續研究，不遺餘力，結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑。名曰三那星Ｓanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明軍　德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者，據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實騐報告，此藥有滲透肺病竈之結節及溶解蠟質之作用，兼具有殺菌力，能根治一二三期之肺癆，確有萬試萬靈之特效，在中國，業經國民政府中央衞生試騐所化騐，藥性和平無毒，絶無任何副作用，茲略舉醫治作用於下，</p>
<p>（一）設於試騐管中，實騐「三那星」之藥力作用，則一分鐘後，結核菌皆消失其抗酸性，至三公鐘後，則此肺結核菌，完全殺盡，無一倖免，</p>
<p>（二）依動物試騐，則發見「三那星」能滲入結核病竈内，設檢查其病竈内濳伏之結核菌，則盡失其抗酸性，此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣，</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服「三那星」一星期左右，則立見咯痰稀釋，體熱下降等良好狀態，</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服「三那星」　三十天至六十天以上，則顯見體重增加，食慾激進，一切症狀，逐漸緩和，終達其回天再造之偉功</p>
<p>奉送三那星實驗報告書及肺病療指導書函索即寄</p>

<p>英動議交國際法庭審查</p>
<p>北歐代表團集議</p>
<p>謀經濟上之聯絡</p>
<p>路透十八日日内瓦電　國聯行政會會議今晨由英外相漢德森行開幕禮、英外相嗣動議德奥關稅恊定、應移交國際永遠法庭查明該約内容是否與聖哲門和約及一九二二年十月一日日内瓦協定不相抵觸、並稱、應請該法庭從速辦理此事、發表意見、繼由奥副總理史科白用英語聲明無保留贊助英外相之建議、但力爭奥德之行動、實不違法、又謂奥國願俟國際法庭、判决及經國聯討論後、再定進行方針、法外長白里安亦贊助英外相之建議、德外長寇蒂斯及意外相格蘭第亦均以英外相之建議爲然、於是乃宣布延會、定明晨十時表决英外相之建議、</p>
<p>路透十八日日内瓦電　昨夜德代表聲稱、奥德兩國决計不因法國之反對、而放棄其所擬之關稅同盟、奥國之政治獨立、不因此同盟而稍受妨害云、按星期六日法外長白里安曾指奥德關稅同盟爲違法</p>

<h3>讀尙仲衣君「再論兒童讀物」乃知「鳥言獸語」確實不必打破　吳研因</h3>
<p>尙先生「再論兒童讀物、」似針對「擁護幻想性童話」者而發、可是對鄙人的問題、所答未能十分圓滿、雖未圓滿、但我也覺得很滿意了、</p>
<p>驟讀了尙先生的大作、空氣非常緊張、好像現在中國小學敎科書、充滿了尙先生所說的「幻想性童話」、而且有許多「幻想性童話」的信徒、方在大聲疾呼地擁護牠、而提出問題的我、正是擁護幻想性童話」的渠魁、其實呢、我可以用笑話安慰尙先生、我們敝國的小學敎科書、根本就未嘗和美國的敎科書一樣、關於「幻想童性話」的材料、實在不多、所謂自然社會或者常識等敎科書、關於「幻想性童話」敎材、固然一點都没有、就是國語敎弚書有一些兒、也是微乎其微的、至於擁護「幻想性童話」的人呢、尙先生的論文好像指定是我、其實尙先生誤會了、我雖茅塞未開、决不致於做「幻想童話」的忠臣、我的態度、正和尙先生一樣、以爲應該「審愼地選擇、保留其有藝術價値和游戲興趣的第一流童話」、要是尙先生肯看一看敎育部所定的小學國語暫行課程標準關於國語選材的種種限制、那就可以不致有此會了、可者鄙人也並不以爲尙先生的言論是「無的放矢」、中國的小學敎科書、將來、或者誤會變成美國的敎科書一樣充滿了「幻想性童話」、而鄙人也需要尙先生的指導、尙先生這樣一說、使我們以後「格外審愼選擇」、這也實在是很好的、</p>
<p>以上是對於尙先生「再論兒童讀物」篇中出於誤會之處的答覆、</p>
<p>至於尙先生應該答我的是一個「鳥言獸語是否就是神怪故事」的最緊要的問題、尙先生對這問題、並未明白答復、這是我所認爲不十分圓滿的、</p>
<p>我以爲鳥言獸語有些是一種作文法中的「擬人法」、有些是說明生活的自然故事、和封神榜聊齋誌異的記載裁然不同、不但不能和神怪故事混爲一談、而且也不能和「幻想性的童話」混爲一談、固然也有許多神怪故事笔「幻想性童話」而不離鳥言獸語的、但是確又許多鳥言獸語而毫無神怪成分、且不盡含有幻想、例如禽言詩的「快快布榖」藉以勗勉農夫、「貓和蝸牛」（見新制國語第五册）的問答、藉以說明、蝸牛的生活這何嘗有一些怪幻想的成分呢、尙先生前次把鳥言獸語和神怪故事混爲一談、並且有「低年級······不用鳥言獸語」的絶對主張、此次又把鳥言獸語和「幻想性童話混爲一談、眞是一誤再誤了、但是尙先生對鳥言獸語、却在這次的論文中流露贊成我的「不必打破」之說了、他說、「把童話數量大加删削、格外審愼選擇、……像吉林的「象兒」則不妨保留」、鄙人就把「象兒」來研究、象兒旣和駝鳥說話、又和長頸鹿說話、並和蟒蛇及鰐魚說話、不但有鳥言獸語、並且有蛇言鰐語、他叙述象鼻本短、給鰐魚拉了而後長的一　、更含有神怪而帶著幻想性（譯文見開明書店、出版之如此如此書中）、在中國小學敎科書、現尙有有人敢採用這類敎材、而尙先生却主張保留、則尙先生贊成鳥言獸語的程度、實在還比我們更進一步呢、這尙先生承認不必打破鳥言獸語的一個有力的證明、</p>
<p>尙先生雖未明白答復我那「鳥言獸語是否就是神怪故事」的問題、但他已實在贊成鳥言獸語了、所以我說尙先生的答案雖不圓滿、而我却認爲滿意、</p>
<p>尙先生旣贊成鳥言獸語、何以鄙人還要多說呢、鄙人只怕我國小學敎育界和關心小學敎育的一般人、還未明白尙先生的意旨、把我們的議論弄糊塗了、而反同情於某省政府主席所謂「打破鳥言獸語」的論調、</p>
<p>可悲的很、我國小學敎科書方才有「兒童化」的趨勢、而舊社會即痛駡爲「貓狗敎科書」、倘不認清尙先生的高論、以爲尙先生也反對「貓狗敎科書」、則「天地日月」、「人手足刀」的敎科書或者會復活起來、果然復活了、兒童的損失何可限量呢、</p>
<p>最後、我還要請大家注意、童話固然包括一部分的神話和物話、（不是全部、因爲神話物話中、有許多不能算爲童話）、但物話也有兩種、一種是含幻想性的、一種就是自然故事、尙先生的言論、雖不很贊成物話、但他對「自然故事」並未反對、我們以後要是編輯小學敎科書、别誤會了尙先生的意思、「自然故事」也不敢用、我並希望尙先生以身作則、自出心裁的編一兩篇模範的口中國兒童讀物出來、以使鄙人心目中認識一認旘、「新園地」的眞面目、要是能編出一兩部給全國兒童讀的敎科書、則更馨香禱祝、爲全國兒童欣幸、</p>
<p>附帶聲明、我方在急於要完成一種低年級充滿自然故事（不避鳥言獸語）的國語敎科書、無暇我所討論、尙祈尙先生徐「烏言獸語是否就是神怪故事而應該打破」的一問題外、别再發不很關於本題的言諭、否則不但離題太遠、鄙人也不敢再和尙先生討論了、</p>

<p>謂實係董慕超之化名</p>
<p>公安局請求引渡未准</p>
<p>結果交殷實舖保出外</p>
<p>虹口靶子路中國精神研究會、爲肉眠學家鮑芳洲所創辦、鮑籍粤東、民國初元、游學日本、專攻精神學、頗有心得、至民七學成返滬、始以催眠術爲人治病、尙具成效、繼乃創設此會、十餘年來、所著研究精神學之書籍甚廣、國人之崇拜其學術者、因</p>
<p>鮑設有函授部　紛紛願列門牆、俾廣流傳、故報名加入該會之會員、日益增加、且鮑復不分性别、以是女弟子尤不乏人、如此次首都舉行國民會議、被推爲主席團之陜西劉純一女士、亦屬會員之一、他如張副司令介弟天津市長張學銘及遜清李故相國之孫李穆公等、俱</p>
<p>先後執贄請益　而鮑之名遂愈彰、顧此種催眠術、縱極靈騐、然祇能爲療病之用、若施之於罪犯、訊取供詞則爲世界各國所禁、所其所取出之口供、係使罪犯失去知覺之後、而得非罪犯自願承白也、頗聞去年本市最高軍事當局因鞫一共産黨、而其人狡點異常、屢審不獲確供、曾一度召鮑前去、</p>
<p>以術施諸共匪　乃盡得其秘、但厥後該案定讞、是否以此項供詞爲標準、則無人知、然鮑嗣輒舉此事詡其術之靈騐、謂當時深蒙當局嘉奬、欣然自得、不意前日鮑忽被捕、其罪狀則爲世人所切齒痛恨之「宣布共産嫌疑」、捕之者、爲本市公安局、據謂近因接山西省黨部清黨委員會來函、以靶子路一百七十六號精神研究會、創辦者粤人鮑芳洲、實係</p>
<p>共産黨董慕超　之化名、假研究學術之名、而行宣傳共産之實、應請就近拿辦、以遏亂萌云云、陳希曾局長、以旣據黨部檢舉、虚實均應澈究、因查其地址屬公共租界、爰於前日派偵探曹澄清投虹口捕房、請求協助拘提、經捕頭向特區地方法院請得拘票、始派中西探員按址前往、將鮑逮捕、並即詳細搜查、僅搜得精神</p>
<p>研究會會員册　毫無涉及共産之書籍等物品、昨晨解鮑至特院、由馮世德推事開第三法庭研訊、市公安局未派代表到案、而工部局則由厲志山律師出庭、反對將鮑引渡、據厲律師稱、捕房查得被告以鮑芳　洲名義在租界行醫、已十有三年、從無另名董慕超之事、山西黨部來函所云、殊難置信、倘市公安局欲僅憑該函要求將被告引渡、則應</p>
<p>提出充分證據　證明犯罪事實、捕房自可贊成、隨將會員名册呈案、馮推事旋質之被告供名鮑芳洲、廣東人、三十八歲、並不名董慕超、即全體會員内、亦無董慕超其人、可就名册中細按、並將其在日本研究催眠術學成來滬創立精神學研究究之經過情形、及客歲應本埠軍事當局之召試騐催眠術、</p>
<p>向匪訊取供詞　一事、詳爲陳述、末言在滬多年、以不善交際、朋友甚鮮、平生更不干預國事、並由其所处之律師將數年來所有著作、逐一呈案、請求加以檢查、當可判明被告之志趣、予以省釋、馮推事考慮之下、諭鮑交殷實舖保出外、候函市公安局提出證據後、再行訊奪、是鮑引渡與否、現尙難以逆料也、</p>
<h3>瘋牛出于栅</h3>
<p>狂奔數里傷人毁物</p>
<p>西捕奮勇八槍擊斃</p>
<p>閘北京江路四百十號費興發宰牛作、昨晨忽有水牛一頭、突然發瘋、踰墻逃出、沿途横衝直撞、受傷多人、旋逃至公共租界戈登路相近、被西捕連擊八槍、始倒地奄奄一息、其事頗爲奇趣、爰誌始末如次</p>
<p>狂吼躍出　昨晨八時許、費興發宰牛作、代客宰黄牛三頭、水牛一頭、當以時間尙早、將四牛禁閉竹栅内、藉備及時牽出宰殺、詎知迨十時半許、一水牛忽狂吼數聲、一躍出栅、跳過垣牆、向馬路間亂奔、</p>
<p>傷人毁物　作内諸工人、見該牛越牆逃出、以水牛力大、恐肇禍端、即追出逐捕、但該牛如中瘋癲、飛奔狂跳、以角亂撞、所向披靡、無敢抗者、而該處太陽廟路一帶之屋、均屬簡陋之矮平房、凡經該牛光顧者、莫不傷人毁物、計太陽廟路隆福里十六號男孩陸慶懷十二歲、受創最劇、頭部被牛角挑碎、腰際踏傷、京江路十八歲女孩李招弟腿部手臂受傷、太陽廟路四十九號草棚湯乃興被撞倒地、衣破血流、而尤以同路義德西里十號之夏德鴻家内什物、盡行搗毁、損失不貲、（以上諸人、均投報該管四區總署）、其餘受微傷及損壞家具者尙不計、</p>
<p>八槍殞命　該管四區太陽廟派出所警長楊錦堂得悉、率警追逐、無如該牛絶不畏懼、如入無人之境、警士無法可施、目送其越過鐵道、經大統路折入共和路向西、取道恒豐路、過舢舨廠新橋而抵卡德路、時該管捕房某醵捕見一水牛如潮奔至、知係瘋牛、擬以手攔之、詎被該牛一撞、跌出數尺、滿身泥水、西捕立即躍起、舉槍連擊八槍、該牛力始不支、踣倒於卡德路戈登路口、當將其車送龍飛車行、按該牛自京江路逃至戈登路、有數里之遙、遇物亂撞、莫敢之抗、洵至身中八槍、始倒地而死、亦云奇矣、</p>

<p>世界市面之衰敗</p>
<p>民國十九年（即一九三○年度）、全世界經濟狀况、均極端趨於衰沉、除法荷兩國外、各國政府人民、殆無不喘息於經濟凋敝中、其現象之尤顯著者、（一）貿易之衰退、各國貿易、較之上年、均形減少、英國輸入、减少百分之一四·四、輸出减少百分之二一、美國輸入减少百分之三○·四輸出减少百分之二六·七　日本輸入减少百分之三○·三、輸出减少百分三一·六、德國（一月至十月累計）輸入較上年同期、减少百分之二四·一、輸出减少百分之八·六、即就比較上市面最佳之法國而言、是年輸入雖有百分之一、一之微增、而輸出則不免有百分之一四·六激減（二）失業人數之增加、據國際勞工局估計、是年全世界失業人數、達一千一百八十萬人、較之上年增加兩倍、（三）物價之跌落、歐戰以來、世界物價指數、迄一九二九年上、猶無顯著之變動、至一九三○年之春、物價忽呈激落之勢、據英國貿易局關於躉賣價格之調查、以一九二四年（民十三年）之平均總數爲一百、食料品、（如榖類、魚肉及其他等）一九二九年之平均總數爲八七·四、而一九三○年則落至七六·一、計跌去一一·三、非食料品、（如鋼鐵、煤及其他鑛物、棉花、羊毛及其他紡織品、雜貨等、）一九二九年平均總數爲七九·四、而一九三○年爲六九·六、計跌去九·八、若以是年年終之總數爲標準、則跌落之象更甚、考世界經濟衰頽之原因、其重要者、不外左列數端、（一）生産之過剩、歐戰時因食糧缺乏、各生産國如加拿大、美國、澳洲等極力奬勵墾植、擴充産額、日積月累、無法銷售、崦製造品亦因科學進步、大量生産及關稅戰爭之故、亦有生産過剩之患、僅舉美國而論、計小麥一項、一九三○年之滯貨達一千零三十一萬噸、他如咖啡達一百七十萬噸、棉花達一百三十五萬噸、橡皮達二十八萬噸、以購買力最强之美國猶如此、其他各國可　二人爲的　　　價、生　　　　　價跌落物價跌落、則生産者受損、於是國政府往往以人爲的方法、維持貨物之價格、例如美國、加拿大之於小麥、或由政府收買或則組織團體屯購、以備缺乏時待價售出、然連年豐收愈積愈多已非財政能力所能任、則又從而貶價傾銷、到是不特小麥之生産者蒙其害、且因生産者不能脫售其手中之産品、以易其他物品、至其他物品之生産者、亦同陷於呆滯之境、（三）關稅之戰爭、生産過剩、己國之力不足以消費之、則人人咸思以鄰國爲壑、同時人人咸慮其爲鄰國之壑、於是提高關稅、相互抵制、致貨物流通、失其常態、美國富力冠於世界、且居於最大債權國之地位、而亦高築關稅之牆壁、致國際的分業之利益爲之喪失、而國際貿易發生異狀、生産者因不能預測其銷路如何、常發生不安、甚至延而爲社會上之不安定、而在勵行保護政策之國家、則因排斥外貨之故、不得不增加國内之生産、以彌補其闕陷、因之益促成生産過剩之勢、（四）世界金準備分配之不均、據一九三○年十一月底、全世界已經調查之四十五國之金準備額、約爲二十二億三千萬鎊、其中美國佔百分之三八·五、法國佔百分之一八、英國佔百分之七、其餘四十國佔百分之三六·五、纔合八萬萬鎊而已、蓋歐戰而後、世界金準備、漸次爲美法兩國所吸收、其餘各國之金準備額日見減少、人人爲保全現金計、致國際金融不能圓滑、在匯兌上立於不地位之國家、則思時時注意於本位制之維持與安定、如日本之勵行緊縮政策、以期集中其財力於金解禁之實行、使工商業不振之狀態、益趨嚴重、是其明證、（五）其他如美國事業界之過度投機、造成市塲恐慌、銀價之繼續跌落、致中印兩民族購買力減退、與夫中印兩邦政治之不寜、皆直接或間接、予世界市塲以不良臗影響、以上種種、各國公私團體之研討、專家之論著、以及金融機關之調查報告、無虜數千百種、毋待吾人之贅述、茲摘舉其影響於我國者一二端、述之如次、（一）銀價跌落之主因、固在乎供過於求、其趨勢則與一般物價普遍低落、初無異理、在用金諸國、銀爲之物、雖猶不失其爲貴金金屬、然其貨幣的資格已漸薄弱、降而儕於一般商品之伍、自不得不追隨於一般物價之後、而爲進退、一九三○年銀價之跌落、關係於我國財政經濟者、至重且鉅、其詳見另章、（二）因各國失業者之日增、在外華僑、首受其累、南洋一帶、失業華僑已不下四十餘萬人、以海外無工可覓、紛紛回國者、雖無詳數可稽、一九三○年中、殆不下十餘萬人、以視曩昔、每年有數萬人出口者、得失之間、適得其反、計一九二九年華僑匯顺本國之欵、以每鎊十五元計、約合銀幣三萬萬元、一九三○年鎊價達二十元、而匯欵只合銀幣二萬五千萬元、以銀計則減少六分之一、以金計則竟減少五分之二、此於我國國民經濟上、國際匯兌上、均爲莫大之不利、（三）理論上、我國出口貿易、應隨銀價跌落而增進、而一九三○年、出口貨物價値、反較前年減少一億二千萬海關兩、其減率最著者爲絲經、計出口減少四千六百萬海關兩、以金價計算、祇及上年之半數、全國絲廠停業者達八成以上、其次則爲東三省之農業物、一九三○年收穫極豐、而豆類出口減少四千五百萬兩、省東市面因之一落千丈、經營油豆業者倒閉不計其數、茶葉出口減少一千五百萬兩、皮張減少一千一百萬兩、反是、世界物價跌落之結果、亦有有利於吾國者、如麥棉兩項得以廉價入口、國内紗布麵粉兩業、得以不因内地戰事而感原料之不足、與夫因金價騰貴而漲價、小民衣食所需、不至受重大之脅威、此不無足述者、茲將一九三○年米、麥、油、棉四項每月市價及金價、列表如左、以資比較、</p>

<h3>東京中日古今畫會紀要</h3>
<p>— 畫禪</p>
<p>日本繪畫。源出我華。故於吾國古畫尤爲珍視。近日政府爲闡揚東方之美術。供國人之觀摩。特派正木直彦渡邊晨畝來華。與滬杭蘇京津平遼各收藏家書畫家接洽。至前月杪始籌備完善。會址在東京上野公園美術館。會期自四月二十八至五月十九日。開幕之日。會長伯爵清浦奎吾正木直彦。及名譽會長吾國汪袞甫公使致開會辭。一木喜德内相。幣原外相。田中文相。及吾國代表王一亭梁鴻志袁思永等。均致祝辭。彼都各界名流均與會。濟濟蹌蹌。禮式極爲隆重。會場頗宏壯。内分古畫今畫兩部。古畫以清人作品最多。明次之。元又次之。宋畫亦列數幀。吾國前清内府所藏之黄子久朱德潤趙大年諸名蹟亦在列。梁鴻志羅振玉張漢卿蒯若木曹元度金開藩羅原覺諸收藏家均有名貴出品。惜滬蘇諸藏家未能踴躍參與。致與原定件數相差尙鉅耳。而日本方面則儘量搜羅。如帝室博物館東京美術學校曁東西京各名收藏家。均出其精品陳列。合計三百餘件。都爲前次唐宋元明名畫展所未見者。雖難免有贋鼎雜乎其間。然吾國繪畫之精華。亦可一表於世矣。今畫部可二百餘件。由上海北平天津杭州蘇州等處徵集者。以上海出品爲數最多。且頗有精采。以此處畫家最盛也。日畫家年來努力精進。此次出品每人以一件爲限。皆揀選工細精美富有藝術意味者。以示彼邦繪畫之特長。聚古今中外繪畫於一堂。相形之下。優絀自見。願吾國畫家加之意焉。日本朝野素重藝術。此會參觀者之踴躍。輿論之宣揚。美術空氣。非常濃厚。回顧我國消息杳然。昨特訪問馬孟容畫家於斜橋容齋。得悉旅東種種通訊。亟錄一二。以告關心藝術者。又此次赴日與會之畫家二十餘人。備受彼邦人士之歡迎。游归殆無虚日。聞有數人將於下旬返滬云。</p>
<h3>婦女節制會代表大會誌盛</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>中華婦女節制協會。於月之十六日在一品香舉行第二屆全國代表大會開幕典禮。到會代表。計有湘鄂粤桂江浙贛皖冀魯吉遼等十使省。衣香鬢影。濟濟一堂。爲滬上女界空前之盛舉。爰將見聞所及。紀實本談。諒亦全國二萬萬女同胞所樂聞也。</p>
<p>會場上高懸「家齊國治而後天下平」九字横額。旁有聯曰「提倡慈孝貞儉」。「拒絶烟酒賭邪」。四壁貼有「打破墮落的多妻制度。」「建設一夫一妻的美滿家庭」。「節省烟酒賭邪耗費。「救濟痛苦無告同胞」等標語。兩旁陳列該會各種成績照片數十張。或表演游藝。或比賽演說。均活潑可愛。并懸世界婦女節制會發起人韋麗德女士遺像。及節制運動之先導陳玉聆女士玉照。各人簽到後。贈以該會所出之「節制」會刋。詳載十年來拒毒工作。及編輯概况。主席楊美貞女士。衣小方格旗袍。致開會詞時。操極流利之普通話。態度從容。語簡而明。到會代表有髮髻者。僅鄭揚秀夫人等五人。咸穿旗袍。袍外罩大衣者十分之三。罩馬夾者十分之二。以年齡言。二十者最多。約有十分之七。未及二十者不到十分之一。年在四十以外者。約十分之一。劉王立明報告籌備會經過情形外。比大會爲火爐。謂此次集合各省代表之意見。相互研究。不啻火爐之鎔化各項鑛質而成結晶。且有中國女子運動尙在幼稚時代。希望代表之父兄。曁今日到會之男賓。盡力協助等語。繼由林康侯與王雲五二君相繼演說。林君除贊成該會南京代表不希望做大事。說空話。主脚踏實地以工作爲目的。不以理想動人。用最經濟方法。做最多事業之四項主張外。并謂節制二字。包含甚大。不獨烟酒賭邪無益之事應節制。即讀書運動有益之事亦應節制。否則用腦過度。運動劇烈。亦有危險。王君謂最近調查上海杭州兩處監獄内犯人之嗜好。上海吸鴉片者百分之二十八。吸捲烟者百分之七十四。飮酒者百人之六十四。嗜賭者百分之七十二。狎妓者百分之三十二。好爭鬥者百分之五十八。喜裝飾者百分之二十六。杭州監内犯人之嗜好。較上海方面程度较低。足證上海之社會環境。較杭州惡劣。貴會以拒絶烟酒賭邪爲目的。有改造社會重大責任。今日又係十週紀念。不得不來道喜。以希望貴會十而百。百而千。千而萬之永久發達。林克聰女士後到。主席請其演講。林女士謂民法上雖已訂定男女平等。但法律是死的。欲運用此女權。全賴一般有知識之姊妹。出來敎育一班無知識之女界同胞。倘仍舊胸懸黄布香袋。口念阿彌陀佛。恐法律雖平等。實際仍無益。繼由鄭揚秀夫人致答詞。操粤語。謂鄙人白髮蒼蒼。言語不通。恐有人要笑我思想落伍。但自問雖係老太婆。對於社會事業尙能負仔肩云云。聽者動容。散會後即宴飮。席上余日章等所說趣聞頗多。限於篇幅。故不多贅。</p>
<h3>荀慧生之三名劇</h3>
<p>— 繡虎生</p>
<p>慧生以前來滬。三日打泡劇目。皆爲舊劇。而首夕爲鴻鸞禧。此次乃以荀灌娘香羅帶棋盤山三劇打泡。不無有詫其奇特者。其實三劇皆老本。而加以翻新者也。荀慧生之藝。唱則柔媚絶倫。做則出神入化。靡一弗佳。而其表情之妙造自然。尤爲難能。最能捉住觀者之情緒。而使其喜怒哀樂不克自持。如此方足符藝術家與人美感之本旨也。荀灌娘係閨門兼刀馬旦之重頭戲。數十年來只王瑤卿以此馳譽不衰。今則唯一荀慧生得其眞傳。舉凡文武唱念四著。無不吃重。蓋慧生之本工佳劇也。昔者慧生演此。瑤卿在座觀戲有人大呼極像瑤卿神情。並有人詢瑤卿像不像者。瑤卿亦莞爾。贊同其佳可知矣。香羅帶係翻新之青衣正戲。塲子少而極緊凑。情節之奇詭。眞有令人恨不得代劇中人說破寃枉急煞情景。慧生翻新各劇、當以此爲最動人也。棋盤山一刀馬旦名劇也。慧生得之於瑤卿。當竇仙童與薛丁山說親之嬌羞。惟慧生能得艶不雅之風趣。復又將老本中增出滑稽與唱工之穿插甚夥。慧生演之最宜。觀於此。可知三劇皆係極有價値之翻新佳劇。處處不失慧生本來面目。預計開演之日。必將轟動春申也。</p>
<h3>黄海環遊記（七）</h3>
<p>— 黄炎培</p>
<p>說到移民。原是東三省一大問題。五六年來。山東人民。不堪横征暴斂。自動的移往東省。前後積計。幾及二百萬人。使日本人大大的剌目。這兩年來。因内地較爲平安。漸漸地移回去了。我過大連。問辦理移民事務者。纔知本年移去者。還不及移回者的多。</p>
<p>去年浙江辦一批移民到遼寗。結果狠不圓滿。聞留下者無幾了。其原因在管理不得法。且準備不充分。亦因生活習慣。相去太遠。浙江人民以米爲糧。一到耕地。索米不得。即有之。亦非力所能給。於是大大的感苦。其他風俗習慣種種不同。結果惟有回去。我們在十幾年前。也招過江蘇農民到東省開墾。到底没有好結果。還是招了河北山東人。纔過去。大概知識程度較低的人。除掉物質生活。别無方法可以得到精神上的安慰。所以他們有賴於物質上的供給。比知識程度較高的。還要迫切。所以移民有一原則。祇可移甲地人到乙地。乙地人到内地。而不可移甲地人逕到丙地。日本移本國人於南鮮。移南鮮人於北鮮。而移北鮮人於遼吉。亦爲此故。近聞湖南爲解决飢荒問題。正在計畫移民到東省。不知能免蹈浙江覆轍否。</p>
<p>上邊說到水稻問題。如果承認此原則的。我以爲與其招别處人。不如招河北玉田豐潤帶人去敎種。</p>
<p>去年東省大豆之過剩。亦有種種原因。移民日多。墾地日闢。又適遇大豐年。生産額大增。而以金貴銀賤。歐洲市塲不動。日本欲以他物充肥料而不用豆餅。正在試騐因此種種。演成供過於求的現象。我在東時。聞得哈爾濱一埠還積有八萬車黄豆。二萬餘車大麥。—每車一千布特。每布特三十斤。—有某某數銀行。因收買黄豆。損失達三千八百餘萬圓無可彌補。乃續發六千萬哈大洋票以爲掩飾。可見影響的嚴重了。</p>
<p>東省政府對於這種現象。如認爲一時偶然的。來年不會如此。則亦罷了。否則應决定一種政策。布告人民。來年减種大豆。改種什麽什麽。免得來年再不了。更不了。這纔算盡政府的責任。</p>

<h3>霍桑探案轉灣（一六）</h3>
<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>（六）驚喜的消息</p>
<p>我到霍桑寓裏去回覆的時候。已交十點半鐘。他的僕人施桂告訴我。霍桑在清早時照例出去從事户外運動。至今不曾回來。連早飯都不曾吃過。我暗忖霍桑的行動。一定也在那裏偵查這人的踪跡。不過他憑空無據。究竟從那條路進行。我却推想不到。我坐在他的辦公室中。吸着一支烟。靜悄悄等他回來。可是十一點鐘過了。烟罐中的紙烟。已連續消耗了三支。却仍不見霍桑回寓。我耐着性子。直等到十二點一刻。才見霍桑喘吁吁的從外面進來。我見他的臉容沉着。精神上似很疲乏。顯見他朝來的工作一定是很緊張的。他卸了那件玄色的薄呢外褂。便把身子倒在那隻安樂奇上。我問道。「你可是爲昨晚的事奔走麽。」霍桑但點了點頭。一壁摸出紙烟來呼吸。我又道。「可已有什麽結果。」霍桑搖頭道。「那是磨刀背的工作。現在還不能說。你的成績怎麽樣呢。」我便把經過的情形說了一遍。霍桑縐着眉頭。緩緩說道。「這却奇了。難道我的理想錯誤了嗎。」我捉住了這句。急忙問道。「你的理想怎樣。我還没有聽得你說過。」霍桑頓了一頓。才道。「據我料想。這個人旣非行刧。又不是報復。却是一種因誤會釀成的酸素作用。」我疑訝道。「這話怎樣解釋。他難道會和我——」霍桑接嘴道。「正是和你。你倒有自知之明呢。這回事他固然由於誤會。但你也不用分辯。昨晚上你實在和你的小姨太接近些了。據我冷眼觀察。因著你小姨的漂亮。除了那個作難我們的人外。還有好幾個少年。都似羨似妒的向你側目而視。不過你身處局中。自己不覺得罷了。」我覺得有些不安。耳根上了略略有些熱灼。我答道。「我也過慮到這點。當時曾竭力迴避。祇是那佩芬孩子氣太重。兀自厮纒着不放。」霍桑道。「這個我當然諒解你的。不過在别的人眼中。那没意識的妒意。也是很自然的。」我道。「如此說來。昨夜的事竟由我而起。但他爲什麽要作弄你呢。」霍桑道。「那有什麽疑問。他當然也想得到一人難敵四手。自然不能不設法先把我調開。因此之故。我滿意也許可從佩芬嘴裏。查明這個人的眞相。你想伊不會故意隱瞞你麽。」我急忙應道。「這個决不會的。伊的性情和天眞的稚氣。都可保證伊的。我敢說「機詐」二字。在伊的心意中還没有地位。」</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市略呈秀氣</h3>
<p>紗市略堅、但海外棉市尙疲、時局流言仍多、故賣方壓迫、依然劇烈、所以市面趨勢、尙在疲軟中、市盤一漲、賣氣愈熾、且傳說十支粗紗殊覺呆滯、底貨甚厚、本月份有大批交解說、賣方聲勢、十分强壯、然某巨商態度平靜、仍無鬆念、對於本月份大量之額、現在仍安然不動、有一方云、大約預備收進一萬多包、不過匯兌難鬆、金價又見左騰、故對於輸出方面、仍有希望、至於十支粗紗銷路、時局如無極大變端、或有大量銷塲、</p>
<p>人標後市上進　入標前市開盤、美棉又跌、人心虚弱、然塲中新的賣户較爲缺乏、各跌一三錢午後聞金價上漲、實需暢達市氣轉緊、各漲四五七錢、成交計一萬八千六百擔、查賣出公泰一千三百五十包、裕康五百五十包、昶記六百五十包、大昶六百包、買進和愼一千包、泰興七百五十包、賡豐一千四百包、益昶九百包、長豐一千一百包、永豐六百包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市晨低午高</h3>
<p>棉市晨跌午漲、美棉仍跌、然匯兌緊張、金價又見上漲、致人心帶緊、惟多數散户、抛空看跌、實係底貨乾枯、雖有惡劣環境、市面未能大跌也、不過狀况終屬平淡云、</p>
<p>漢標大勢平淡　漢標前市開盤、隨外棉而跌、人心甚虚、各跌二錢、午後以紗市稍挺、回漲二三錢、全日成交計四萬三千一百擔、查賣出泰興一千八百擔、長豐一千八百擔、德記一千擔、新亨一千二百擔、買進和愼一千一百擔、天隆一千一百擔、愼昌二千三百擔、茲將收盤價錄左、漢標收盤漲跌　存賬數　七月三八一五漲○五一八五、七六○</p>

<h3>糧食　客秈步漲二三角</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况堅俏、因河下米到少價昻、本街注意客秈、連日一再添辦後、市上存底日薄、行情逐步上漲、前日成交二千餘包、價已續漲角許、昨日本街進胃更佳、行情又見跳漲一二角、比之上週中市價已步漲有三角以上矣、全日成交江西機晚三千餘包、價十一元四角至一角、可紅機晚五十包、價十元○六角七分、又機元二百包價十元○二角八分、湖南機油米七百包、價十一元四局至二角半、南京柳米四百三十包、價十元○二角、行情雖與前市相似、但貨品低次、合價已見高漲云、</p>
<h3>洋米續有大批成交</h3>
<p>連日洋米新交易甚多、糧商與洋行及客帮等興味極佳、市上已有回籠貨交易、自杜米與客秈上漲後、進户胃口更佳、行情亦步步上升、前日成交一號西貢八百噸、價比前定已漲、昨日又成交一千噸、六月底期價五兩五錢半、係祥茂售出、又萬興回出月内交貨一百噸、價五兩六錢半、同興泰售出六月份小絞一千四百噸、價五兩三錢、又六月份敏黨一千噸、價五兩四錢、價均比上週初次售開者、較大二三錢、此後如進户貪辦市而尙有年好也</p>
<h3>標粉漲風激昻</h3>
<p>昨日粉市開盤、又見激昻之漲風、以前日雨勢甚盛、至昨日開盤前、亦未稍停、故洋麥報價雖小三四角、惟内地帮之心思、終以新麥將次登塲、不宜有此天氣、故開價時買氣極盛、人心尤激昻異常、本月份最高至二兩零九分半、六月份至二兩零九分二厘半、七月份至二兩零九分半、八月份至二兩零九分七厘半、九月份至二兩一錢二分二厘半十月份至二兩一錢三分七厘半、較前週收盤好二三分不等、惟至二盤以後、因洋粉之電訊已轉、客帮成交紅日當天六萬包、價二元五角半（聞洋麥亦正接洽數在十萬噸以上）因此市面頓挫、較頂峯時跌一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、因天雨未止、人心仍堅、四盤時曾一度回軟、繼則又復回振、觀後步如天不放晴、人心當然堅勁、但如是相持、無異製成暢進之機會也、結果五九月份較前週漲一分二厘半、六七月份漲一分半、八月份漲一分七厘半、十月份漲二分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>小麥暴漲一錢强</h3>
<p>昨日期麥初頗平穩、因洋麥報價、究小三四角、大部份人心觀望、迨张以内地鑒於天時不正、暫難放晴、所以買氣重振、市價即步步高提、迨到十午開盤、因上午粉市之激漲、人心已爲帶起、開價尙平、旋即又見步漲、交易之暢、及漲度之狂、爲本年所罕見、不過唯一目的全屬天時、事實上尙談不到也、近期係新麥檔口、漲風更漲、遠期因傳洋麥之兜售、比較和緩、結果本月份較前日暴漲一錢三分、六月份漲一錢二分、七月份漲一錢一分、八月份漲九分、九月份漲六分、十月份漲五分云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　洋莊絲市閒散</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、益呈閒散、　海外市塲、華絲廠銷、仍無轉機、電轉價小、華商本　難售市氣擯持、昨祗信孚　滬白廠經五包、中和等進白乾經二十包、克昌進組黄絲十二包、價均堅定</p>
<h3>祁茶成交二千餘箱</h3>
<p>市盤暴跌二三十兩</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、祁門浮梁等路紅茶、怡和·興成·天祥·天裕等行進意濃厚、全市成交二千四百八十二箱、交易尙不寂寞、惟因到貨甚多行家限價已較上星期苛緊、但葉底製法優良之貨、市盤仍可站定中低莊貨、業已暴跌三三十兩、據英倫電稱、英國對於祁門上中莊紅茶、需要雖甚孔亟、然對於此種市盤、頗嫌昻貴、市面能否堅定、尙難預料云、</p>
<h3>湘鄂新茶旺銷店莊</h3>
<p>兩湖茶産之富、甲於全國、曩年洋莊出口紅茶、爲數不下四十萬箱、近年因兵匪頻仍、交通阻塞、外銷不振、茶商資窮、降至今日、勢成强弩之末、近兩年兩湖紅茶運滬銷售洋莊者、已不及往年十分之一、如外銷再無生機、則兩湖紅茶出口、將成絶響、昨據漢臯電訊、湘鄂兩省新茶、除湘屬産茶名區之安化·桃源·紅茶已早開秤、盤價自三十二三元至二十八元、其他鄂屬之通山·羊樓洞·北港·青茶、亦已開秤、盤價自四十至二十元、漢市各茶行多派夥赴山搜辦、進胃極健、華北東省一帶店莊銷塲、近更興旺、茶市局勢、似店莊遠勝洋莊云、</p>
<h3>糖市　日糖廠盤盛開</h3>
<p>市塲劃價均升……本廠冰步漲二錢</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、仍乏到來、公會市場劃盤、氣象頗佳、交易均甚踴躍、荷糖二十四號粗砂白初市價爲十兩○九錢、香港貨十兩○八錢半、買氣仍盛、旋升十兩○九錢二分半至十兩○九錢半、中砂白十兩○四錢至四錢半、趨勢仍挺日糖市亦步升、N嘜十兩○九錢至二分半、TK嘜十兩○九錢至九錢半、YT嘜十兩○八錢半至八錢七分半、最後至十兩○九錢、YRO嘜十兩○三錢半、明華貨十兩○四錢、YP嘜十一兩三錢、JH嘜十兩○五錢、J嘜十一兩三錢半至四鎗、進出極暢、市形甚俏、廠盤大里糖七八月份貨開出一萬五千包、價日金四元四角、明治糖七八月份價日金四元三角半、係前所賣剩者一萬包、如數售出、惟行方買意尙濃、如有追電訂購之舉、太古車糖現貨逐開數千包HX嘜十兩○七錢半、DY嘜十兩○八錢半CW嘜十一兩一錢半、HM嘜十兩○二錢半、H嘜九兩七錢半、但B嘜貨缺、幸華新號有彰向該公司訂購之B嘜、現已到貨故即售開四千包、價十一兩二錢、頗爲俏秀、號盤有禎祥號售開粗砂白四千餘袋、價十兩○九錢半、陳貨亦開出二千餘袋、價十兩○五錢、中砂白開三千袋、價元十兩○三錢、錦發號同價、亦售開千餘袋、市象均皆挺、本廠氷花青裕發號售出二百餘、價升九兩七錢、上海廠售出本廠冰數百包、仁字價十三兩八錢、乾字十三兩七錢、比之前盤、步升二錢、而市氣頗緊、均具步漲之跡云、</p>
<h3>五金　骊口鐵現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>馬口鐵交易近來十分暢達、製罐廠·烟草公司·餅乾廠·印鐵廠等均有採辦、惟到源淺薄、現貨有軋缺之象、標準如九十磅英貨、每箱能估至十六兩三錢半、一百磅十七兩、九十磅美貨十七兩二錢半、一百磅又十八兩、聞九十磅英貨尤爲市上之奇缺者、故市勢較其他更好、調查後批到貨尙需多日、故預料行情方面、將有繼續看好之可能云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　海元肉步升三兩半</h3>
<p>海南元肉前以銷胃不振、曾降至三十兩○半、惟邇來久無續到、且他種元肉到貨亦少、並聞産地桂元花苗現象不佳、本屆聲新、勢將歉收、故號船一再轉緊、初開三十二兩、旋升至三十四兩、比低價時前後升起三兩半、查再底已屬有限、後市尙防再升云、</p>
<h3>油市　柏油愈漲愈焰</h3>
<p>柏油市面、自漢市重荆二十六兩後旋又加起二錢、麻城油做開二十五兩、來源依然稀少、供不敷求、本埠存積毫無、各行家前售皂廠、尙未解齊、即燭淘家亦待貨甚殷而浙江方面、内坪油已售至每件四十元以上、且有價無貨、蘭油亦須三十五元光景、嘉興之本車油亦欲四十元外、據總共不及千件、已無大票可開矣、總之今年市面、爲從來所未有、現在愈漲愈烈、究竟到何程度、可以砥定無論何人、不能預料也、</p>

<h3>菁莪劇社公演一片愛國心</h3>
<p>這是誰也想不到的、事前是無聲無影、突然睛天薜靂一聲、衝破這沉默了許久的上海—菁莪劇社的成立、</p>
<p>就是他們自己、也在迷夢中、能幹下這麽一回驚人的記錄、實在是意料之外的、他們發起組織這個劇社的動機、是在上個月裏、—看到谷劍塵先生給申報「藝術界」的一封信、他說、「一片愛國心、」在鎭江表演的成績很好、很能受觀衆的注目和感動、中國新劇的前途、放出了光明、希望是十分的遠大的……他們讀了上面的事實、好勝的心、不允我們再在徘徊、立刻想照樣的和他們十谷先生主持的江蘇省立敎育學院、一爭高下、所以、迅速的召集他們的同志、立刻地排練起「一片愛國心」來、</p>
<p>至於爲什麽竟至在事前無人知曉呢、因爲他們的目的、是在奮鬥并不想預先大吹大擂、因爲過去的事實告訴我們、預先說得天花亂墜、結果都不圓滿、他們便不肯再蹈覆轍了、所以、整天整晚的趕練戲劇、外間的人們是睡在鼓裏、直待機會的到來、才宣佈大衆、</p>
<p>這的確是他們的幸運、也是他們的吉兆、恰巧在這當兒、同濟因在五月十九日要開紀念會、來請他們加入表演、當然、這難逢的機遇、他們豈肯失掉、所以、更引起了他們的興奮、寗願犧牲一切、爲戲劇盡義務、這次練習的結果、尙能不違志願、這是使他們增加了萬倍的勇氣、</p>
<p>他們這個劇社的成分、是由沿江灣路一帶的學校中的熱心戲劇的同志所組合的、他們的企圖很大、并不只限於一隅、凡是對他們表同情的人們、都有加入菁莪的可能、</p>
<p>這繁雜的上海、夠我們煩悶了、去年雖曾有熱烈的戲劇運動、中國戲劇界的前途、似有萬丈光芒、但不久、不是因爲思想的走入歧路、便是組織的不健全終於曇花一現、仍歸消聲匿跡了、我們現在也正在憂慮—沙漠裏剛發芽的漠花深慮來一陣巨風、中途催亡、很希望對該社表同情的同志、共同來擔起撫育的責作、</p>
<h3>夢想不到</h3>
<p>— 劍秋</p>
<p>夢想不到、因了一件不要緊的事、突然會到杭州去、來往的盤費不要我化費分文、天地間竟有這樣便宜的事情嗎、眞使我感到奇特了、</p>
<p>艶陽的春天、我是感覺厭膩了、雖然是在負有一點事務的責任罷、但在這樣的情形下、對此次的旅行是感着興味了、</p>
<p>車站上的壁鐘、正打了七下、機車的汽笛嗚嗚的響、接着車輪是漸漸移動了、縷縷的黑烟繚繞於靜寞的晴空、這時、繁華的上海、漸漸别了我而向後退去、</p>
<p>靠近了車窗坐着、不時瞑目描想起杭州的風景、這時、像久欲一游的古蹟名勝已展佈於自己的目前、</p>
<p>車過龍華時候、由車窗望去、軌道的兩旁、紅白相間的桃花、被和暖的春風吹得擺搖着、一陣微微的清香時時的撲向我的鼻孔裏來、呵呵、你迷醉人的桃花呵</p>
<p>「…武陵人已杳、猶自向人紅、…」</p>
<p>景象是隨了與城市的距離而變異、離上海漸遠了、含有誘惑性的醉人的風景也漸在目前消失、所有的、是清曠「閒逸、而遠大的郊景、遼闊的天宇、散淡的浮雲、還有、葱瓏可愛的青草、車過松江與嘉興時、田畦裏的菜花繁密的開着、蜂蝶、在向花蕊裏儘意的蹂躪、這時火車迅速的向前猛進、隆隆的機聲和凄厲的長留、引起我激昻的情緒、</p>
<h3>運動場之角</h3>
<p>— 氷攝</p>
<p>將近長安的候、菜花漸漸稀少了、兩旁的田地已改植了桑樹、二三個村婦、灣着腰在割取鮮綠的草、火車過時、她們都注目地抬起頭來、啊、那健康的身體、豐滿的肌肉、和健康的兩隻眼睛、這正是人類的唯一的美、比起那用香粉把臉孔塗成很白的、以誘惑異性的軟弱的城市女人、實在的是自然而美的多了、我……啊、是的、我咒咀好用白粉遮掩了本來面孔而誘或人的女人、只能消耗而不會作任何生産的弱者、</p>
<p>這時的火車迅速地向前駛着、距目的地一刻刻的逼近、我心絃也隨着緊張了、幻想過好久而居然將要實現的這古跡名勝的佳景、頻頻在腦際呈現在許多奇異的幻影、</p>
<p>本來、到了杭州、自己游眺的機會自然很多、崦所要接洽事務的地點、又是湖旁的哈同花園、這更給我以再多游眺機會、</p>
<p>一聲長響後、火車是到杭州了、—每一次的鳴笛、都使我心弦緊張一刻、而此次竟確實的到了、—這時已經下午一點鐘了、本來自己是没有行李的、空了兩手、悠閒地走出站來、許多黄包車夫迎上來兜攬生意、</p>
<p>「先生、車子要麽、」</p>
<p>「到西湖邊哈同花園要多少錢、」</p>
<p>「六角小洋、」他伸出隻手、在同我比着「六」的數目、</p>
<p>「不要、四角小洋十四個銅元、去麽」</p>
<p>「好好、我拉你去、」</p>
<p>他恭謹地放下車子、於是、我跳上去了、一人沉默的坐在車上、似乎微感着寂寞、於是在有意無意向他詢問着、</p>
<p>「西湖離此地遠麽、」</p>
<p>「不遠、」他帶喘的答着、「没有多遠、到旗下就好看見西湖了、」</p>
<p>微暖的春風、拂過我的額頭、心中感到陶醉的微温、這時車已到旗下、西湖是漸漸的近了、啊、夢般的那淡悠悠的青山、三面環抱住西湖、漪漪的湖水、半受日光的映射、反出更强的光線、青翠的柳梢、綠綠飄蕩、拂到行人的面上、這春天中的自然野景、巳使我獲得意識以上的滿意了、但、正式的游湖、還没有嘗試、這是最短時期之將來的期望、</p>

<h3>我們的證人</h3>
<p>— 朱劍白</p>
<p>蕙漪女士著　光華書局出版</p>
<p>快要於五月二十二日結婚的陳蔥漪女士、最近出版她的創作集「我們的證人」、承她惠贈一册、先讀爲快、這集包含有五篇文字、一「我們的證人」、二「梧桐庭院」、三「輕烟」、四「終天恨」、五「疑」、全集從大體上看、都寫兒女情趣、在技巧上、描摹得非常細膩、的是「才情並茂」的作品、</p>
<p>全集最佔重要的文字、當然要推她的代表作「我們的證人」一篇了、這篇是寫一對青年男女戀愛的結合、在女姓的芸、對於她當前的一段事實、——是她們的一對朋友、由戀愛而結合、因誤會而離異、男的又同另一女子結婚、結了又離、離了又向第一被離的女子要求重收覆水、——這實在給芸以重大的激剌、所以她對她的英要作罷她們的訂婚禮、說、</p>
<p>「天下的男子都是靠不住的、他此刻對你切意的温存便是將來十分蹂躪你的暗示、人類是自私自利的、尤以男子爲甚、人類原是厭舊憐新的、尤以男子最甚、人類原是個九尾狐狸、譎詐多端、人類原是個演戲的　猴不離假面、今日之所好、安知不明日非之、明日之所非、又安知不後日愛之……」</p>
<p>「輕烟、」是寫一個少女、滿懷無可奈何的情思、中間有少女們　趣一段、描寫閨裏風光、頗爲生動、</p>
<p>「挹芳、還没有起身嗎、好一副懶骨頭、」屋内擠進了兩個人、第一個是表姊雪琴、後面跟的是挹芬、表姊三脚兩步走上前要拖她、嚇得她央求道、</p>
<p>「限我三分鐘離床、」</p>
<p>她們才比着肩坐在屏風後面臨窗的沙發上、</p>
<p>「你們吃過早點没有、」挹芳一面扣紐子、一面問着、</p>
<p>「早吃過了、」</p>
<p>「表姊呢、」</p>
<p>「吃到此刻已經肚子餓了、」</p>
<p>雪琴說話總是這樣爽快的、因此她的混名呌做無愁小姐、</p>
<p>「無愁小姐、别遇着無腸公子、那就漕透了、」挹芳這樣調侃她、</p>
<p>「一早晨躺在床上原來在遐想無腸公了、」</p>
<p>「終天恨」是夾寫着慈母的愛和兩性的愛、結尾終天恨一歌、情眞語摯、當令天下無母人讀之、都爲雪涙、在這裏足見作者文學的根底了、</p>
<p>「疑」這一篇、是寫一個留學生呌做芸的、因爲寫給她在祖國的未婚妻李珊女士的信、說起美國女人海利娜、給與珊女士以重大的激剌、後來經芸的長函解釋、终於「疑雲吹盡、歡迎海利娜女士來華、」據我神經過敏的話、篇中的李珊、似係作者的化名、而芸者楹也、是否猜中、還須請作者有以告我來、</p>
<p>蕙漪女士、畢業於持志大學文科、現任培成女校高中部國文主任、她富有文學的天才、所爲詩詞、見重於當代文壇、海是各報章雜誌、我們可以時常拜讀到她的佳作、不過、以前人都欽佩她的舊文學、登峯造極、現在、「我們的證人」出版以後、更使我們讚頌　新的創作的成功、據作者相告、「我們的證人」以後、即將有「綠波」詩集的問世、那末一定更可以給現在的著作界、增加多量的活氣、我們惟有誠意的盼望「綠波」早日出版、更給我們一個先讀爲快、</p>

<h3>Chiang Tso-ping Reports on the International Situation</h3>
<p>Speech at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a memorial week on the morning of the eighteenth, chaired by Wang Zhengting. Minister Chiang Tso-ping, stationed in Germany, was introduced to report on the international situation. Chiang said that he had been ordered to serve as minister to Germany for two and a half years. Since the end of the European War, many new countries have emerged in Europe. Before the war, Germany and France were the countries that could influence European politics. After the war, although Germany failed, its diplomats were skilled at adapting to the times.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>What Fate Hinges On</h3>
<p>An Italian newspaper published an article signed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, discussing the colonial problem. It stated that after the end of the war, the territory opened up by Italy was not worth mentioning. However, this pan-Italianism has developed actively and should be further spread outwards in the future. Everyone should consider this a belief upon which their fate hinges. In the world, for any problem that does not concern safety, security, survival, or demise, concessions can be made. However, for fate-related problems that concern safety, security, survival, or demise, one must exert all efforts and not make any concessions. Everyone believes that their fate hinges on it and refuses to yield. This is the cause of the war disasters in Europe. Now that Italy considers pan-Italianism as something its fate hinges on, other countries in Europe, in their desire to escape economic difficulties, also consider the economy as a problem upon which their fate hinges. The great debate between the German and French representatives in the League of Nations committee was due to the tax agreement issue concerning fate. In the meeting, the representatives of the Nordic countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, unanimously decided to act on a certain economic issue because that economic issue was something their fate hinged on. A mass rally of 200,000 people in the capital of Hungary, with representatives from Hungary, Italy, and the Balkans, unanimously demanded the revision of the Treaty of Trianon, with great fervor, because that treaty was something the fate of the Hungarian, Italian, and Balkan peoples hinged on. In addition, the reason why the Soviet Union is urgently carrying out the Five-Year New Economic Plan is that the New Economic Plan is something the fate of the Soviet Union hinges on. Any country whose interests conflict with this plan will inevitably regard it as harming its own fate and strive to cope with it. From this, it can be seen that meetings on fate-related issues rarely have any effect, and mediation is useless. If unfortunately another great war occurs, it must be on these several fate-related issues in the world.</p>
<p>Being astute at breaking through impasses, it was able to raise its international standing to the same level as before the European War. The diplomats of Germany and France were particularly crafty. The European countries feared Russia's communism the most. If the Germans were to turn red, all European countries would be in danger. The Germans used this psychology to control Europe. If European countries exerted too much pressure, they would lean left to restrain them. If the Russians' communist propaganda was too intense, they would lean right to restrain them. Germany used this opportunity to achieve diplomatic victories. Although German and Russian ideologies differed, their relations were still close. At present, the diplomatic struggle in Europe still has Germany and France as the main actors. The countries allied with France are Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Belgium. France uses Yugoslavia to control Italy, Romania and Poland to control Russia, and Poland and Czechoslovakia to control Germany and Austria. Although Belgium is a direct ally of France, it is close to Britain and dares not side with France too much for fear of offending Britain. France's deployments in Europe can be said to be thorough. Germany's allies are only Austria and Hungary. Russia and Italy can only be described as semi-German allies. Since the European War, most of Austria's territory has been divided between Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The industrial areas belong to Czechoslovakia, and the agricultural areas belong to Hungary. The national economy is almost in a state of desperation. Many enlightened people want to merge with Germany, but they are constrained by treaties and cannot realize it. Although Spain was close to Italy in the past, France colluded with its revolutionary party. France's help was significant in the success of the Spanish revolution this time, so Spain has a tendency to ally with France. Although Soviet Russia and Italy are superficially close to Germany, they each have their own ideologies and ambitions. Italy regards itself as the master of the Mediterranean and has conflicts with France due to various secret treaty relations during the war. European people do not want to experience the pain of a second world war. First, because of the cruelty of deaths in the European War. Second, politicians in various countries know that if a war breaks out, it will create opportunities for the Communist Party. Moreover, Italy's military equipment is not as good as France's. France has gained a lot after the war and only seeks to maintain the status quo and does not want to disrupt peace. If a conflict is initiated, the result may not be better than it is now. However, Italy's diplomatic skills are flexible. It is now bringing Turkey and Greece closer together and is considering expanding its power in the Balkans. It is also reported that it is supplying Hungary with weapons to help restore the monarchy, in effect secretly undermining France's Little Entente. It has also completely absorbed Albania into Italy's sphere of influence and allied with Bulgaria. It has secretly concluded a treaty with Germany and Austria, as if placing Yugoslavia in a siege. It has also concluded a treaty with Russia. Its operations are truly astonishing. As for starting a conflict with France, it is still too early. Russia is also a semi-German ally. Russia's ideology is different, and various countries regard it as a different kind. It is in a completely isolated position in the international community. Germany is bound by unequal treaties, so it uses Russia to make a sound of support. Russia, due to its isolation and danger, also uses Germany for the advancement of its ideology. Britain is the most capable country in diplomacy to seize opportunities and observe changes. It is also the most autonomous and proactive country in diplomacy. It never sides with any country in advance. It must suppress the overly strong and exclude those who hinder the development of its empire. At present, Britain's various autonomous colonies are gradually separating from the mother country. It will never easily abandon India. Anyone who endangers its interests in India is regarded as an enemy and must be prevented in advance. Therefore, it is bound to be jealous of Turkey's attention to the east, Italy's management of the Mediterranean, and Russia's connection with Afghanistan and Persia. The people of the Nordic countries have a very high level of development. There have been no wars for more than a hundred years, and their livelihoods are particularly affluent. Although the Netherlands seems to be close to Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark seem to be close to Britain. However, they never lightly express themselves in diplomacy. Currently, in Germany, neither the left-wing nor the right-wing parties can rule. Most of the country's politicians take the country as the premise. In recent years, the German regime has gradually fallen into the hands of the Social Democratic Party, but it does not yet have the ability to form a cabinet. Therefore, it assists the minority Central Party in organizing the cabinet. The country's political strife does not rely on the power of the army to achieve its private struggles. Its spirit of abiding by the law is admirable. Russia is deeply hated and resented by the general public. In the past, its ideology was just an ideal, and the world thought it was easy to eliminate. When the Five-Year Plan was announced, various countries did not pay attention to it. When the results gradually became apparent, visitors from various countries studied it one after another and no longer regarded it as impossible. Russia's Five-Year Plan may be fully completed. The agriculture and industry in the current plan have largely exceeded the planned limits. Currently, Soviet Russia is most concerned with industry, focusing on manufacturing machines so that machines do not rely on people, developing coal mines, and managing oil wells, sparing no effort. Recently, it has also used hydroelectric power to expand power plants as a prelude to the electrification of the country, so that fuel can be reduced, and coal and oil can be used as the largest exports. The success of the agricultural plan in the past two years has greatly exceeded the planned limit. There are about two types of agriculture: state-owned farms and collective farms. State-owned farms are the various confiscated lands and pastures, etc., which are reclaimed by the state by recruiting workers, paying wages, and using machines for cultivation. The organization is no different from a factory. Collective farms are the collection of small farmers, assisted by the state with machines, seeds, fertilizers, and guidance, so that they can cultivate themselves. After the harvest, the state takes away a certain amount, and the rest is divided equally according to the labor and mu (unit of area) contributed by each household. It is never allowed to hire workers to cultivate. The remaining land belongs to the state. Rich farmers are also on the list to be eliminated. In the past year, almost all middle-class farmers in the country have been eliminated. Since industry and agriculture are both developed, great attention is also paid to various transportation, such as railways, waterways, and highways. However, the production of non-ferrous metals has not been developed according to the original plan. This year, it will be reorganized with large capital. The country has hired many German and American scholars and engineers to study in detail. According to the guides, Soviet Russia is currently focusing on domestic construction projects to seek self-reliance and then develop outwards. Since Soviet Russia implemented the Five-Year Plan, European countries have been quite frightened by it. First, its products, created at the lowest cost, are sold abroad at low prices, which easily shake the world economy. Second, its workers' treatment may be better than in Europe and the United States, which easily shake the lower levels of society. Therefore, European and American countries are now striving to find ways to suppress it and improve workers' treatment, fearing its impact. The Russians are thrifty, self-denying, and hardworking, which is admirable. However, once Soviet Russia completes the Five-Year Plan, it will inevitably seek to develop outwards. Europe and the United States are very vigilant about this and fear that it will be difficult to invade. Our country borders Soviet Russia, and the border is usually loose. Once something happens, our country will be helpless. Therefore, the people of our country should conduct a close study of Soviet Russia and devise countermeasures. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Five Province Representatives Telegraph Guangdong Calling for Peace</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Lei Baohuan and 123 other National Assembly representatives from Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui telegraphed Deng Zeru, Gu Yingfen, Lin Sen, Xiao Focheng, Chen Jitang, et al., stating: "Heaven has punished our country. Internal strife is cyclical, and everything is being destroyed. The red atmosphere is intense. The five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Anhui have been reduced to bandit areas. Famine is widespread, and thousands of families are wailing in the wilderness. The misery is indescribable. We, the revolutionary comrades, cooperate with all our strength, still fearing a hundred omissions that may cause the situation to spread and become difficult to control. Recently, reading the news about your thirty telegrams and the telegrams from Wu, Cai, He, Lu, and others, there are occasional disagreements, which have led to rumors and a tense atmosphere. If we resort to force, it will inevitably be taken advantage of by the communists. The people of the southeastern provinces, in deep water and fire, not only have no hope of salvation, but also fear that none will be spared. Thinking of this, we tremble. We believe that you are members of the Central Committee who have shared hardships for a long time. Even if there are misunderstandings, is it not difficult to meet with sincerity? We still hope that you can work together in the same boat and see things through to the end. The survival of the country is at stake. We cannot bear to see brothers fighting again and the people suffering. We plead for the people of the five provinces, begging for salvation. We tearfully say that the words of madmen and fools are fortunate to be noticed." (18th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang et al. Support Peaceful Unification</h3>
<p>Expression on the Guangdong Incident</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Zhang Xueliang et al. telegraphed on the seventeenth: "To all newspapers, We have been reading the telegrams from Yunnan Chairman and Military Affairs Minister He, etc., regarding the Guangdong incident, which are earnest, comprehensive, righteous, and strict. We admire them greatly. Since the founding of the Republic of China, twenty years have passed, and disasters have followed one after another, with few peaceful days. Thinking of it now, the pain remains deep. Recently, the internal strife has been pacified, and unification has been achieved. The National Assembly, which the late Prime Minister had long hoped for, has also been held as scheduled. The spirit of the representatives from all parties actively participating in the meeting is enough to show the urgent desire for governance among the people of the country. Now that the period of destruction has passed, the need for construction is urgent. Looking around, the villages are scarred and devastated, and there are many political matters waiting to be addressed. This is the day for local areas to recuperate and for the people to work hard. If we can work together from top to bottom, it will not be difficult to achieve prosperity. Unexpectedly, an ominous event has broken out in Guangdong again, which is shocking to hear from afar. Recalling that the late Prime Minister created the Republic of China, he experienced many difficulties. The countless martyrs who came before him did not hesitate to shed their blood in the fields, and only then were they able to secure the world and establish this foundation. We are devoted to the party and the country, and we are always eager to maintain and support them. How can we start another conflict and hasten the nation's demise? Moreover, we are all comrades, and we value harmony. Even if there are occasional differences in political views, there is no harm in discussing them calmly. We hope that we can quickly abandon petty grievances and restrain emotions, take the party and the country as the premise, and work together to overcome difficulties. Otherwise, if we gamble on our own, we will surely lose the way and regret it too late. If this leads to war, it will poison the people and destroy unity. We believe that those who love the country and themselves will not do this. Xueliang et al. are mediocre talents who have experienced many changes, but our desire to maintain peace has never changed. As long as there is a breath left, we will never want to see the unified country repeatedly on the verge of collapse. Therefore, we do not hesitate to be ignorant and to express our foolish sincerity. We hope that the wise men of the country will enlighten us." Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Tang Yulin, Zhang Jinghui, Zang Shiyi, respectfully. (18th Dispatch)</p>

The defense forces, because they were ordered to stop military action, did not dare to fight back and retreated five miles.

<h3>Kai Luan Labor-Capital Dispute</h3>
<p>The Two Sides Are Still Deadlocked</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kai Luan labor-capital dispute is still deadlocked. The provincial government has not yet approved the transfer to Tianjin for mediation as of the evening of the 18th. However, the management has not sent a responsible representative to Tangshan for consultation. Therefore, the representatives of the party, government, and labor union all came to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 18th. According to Secretary-General Luo of the Mining Bureau, the suspension of the Beining Railway has led to the accumulation of coal, and work has been suspended for two days a week. As for wages, the minimum is four jiao per day, and the maximum is one yuan and seven or eight jiao. No other mining bureau has such generous wages. According to Su Baicheng, a representative of the provincial party headquarters, the labor unrest at Kai is extremely dangerous. Tangshan is the area with the most communists in North China. Once an accident occurs, they will seize the opportunity to rise up. The mining bureau's shutdown is actually provocative, and it is not that there is no place to store coal. Even ten times this amount could be accumulated. If an unfortunate event occurs, the mining bureau should be held responsible. According to Zhang Yutang, a representative of the labor union, the first request is for the management to cancel the shutdown and then discuss other conditions. Otherwise, wages should be paid as usual. If this is not allowed, the workers will have no choice but to mine coal themselves to maintain their livelihoods. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(1) The Origin of the "Consumption is Inevitably Fatal" Theory</p>
<p>Among the many diseases prevalent in the world, none is as difficult to treat or as widespread as tuberculosis (i.e., consumption). Tuberculosis attacks us anytime, anywhere, without interruption. It is the most harmful and deadly infectious disease. What we fear most is that, from ancient times, consumption has been determined to be a fatal disease. Because it is difficult to cure after contracting it, doctors are at a loss, and patients are shocked and terrified, living in daily fear of an early death. However, in modern times, with the progress of medicine and the emergence of famous doctors, through careful research, it is now known that tuberculosis is not necessarily a terminal illness. If treated properly, eight or nine out of ten cases in the early and middle stages can be cured. Even those in the second and third stages have hope of recovery. Only patients who have been ill for too long and have reached the final stage have no way to be saved. However, being ill for so long that it cannot be cured is not unique to tuberculosis. It is hoped that those who contract this disease will not be negligent in the early and middle stages and can be treated.</p>
<h3>(2) The Discovery of the Pathogenic Bacteria of Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Since ancient times, both Chinese and Western medical circles have had many empty theories and speculations about the pathogens of tuberculosis, all of which were dark and unclear. Recently, Dr. Koch, a great German bacteriologist, discovered that the tubercle bacillus is the cause of tuberculosis, breaking through thousands of years of darkness and illuminating a ray of great light. The Vibrio cholerae is the cause of cholera, the diphtheria bacillus is the cause of diphtheria, the dysentery bacillus is the cause of dysentery, and the occurrence of syphilis is based on the syphilis spirochete, and the occurrence of leprosy is also based on the leprosy bacillus, which is known to the world. The same is true for tuberculosis. Its occurrence is based on the tubercle bacillus. This bacterium is most fond of attacking humans, and its habitat is mostly in our lungs. The number of humans harmed by it is countless. In the past, it accounted for one-seventh of the world's population, and in modern times, it accounts for one-sixth. In cities, it reaches one-fifth. It is truly the most widespread infectious disease.</p>
<h3>(3) The Two Great Benefactors of Lung Disease Patients</h3>
<p>(1) Dr. Koch of Germany</p>
<p>Born in 1843 in Claus, Germany. His family was well-off, so he was able to study in peace in his youth. After graduating from middle school, he entered various national universities to study medicine. Before the age of thirty, he invented the bacteria. Famous doctors in the country admired him. Several years later, on March 24, 1882, Dr. Koch presented his research and discovery of the tubercle bacillus at the Berlin Physiological Society meeting. At that time, the medical community of various countries was shocked. The German government praised his profound knowledge and appointed Dr. Koch as the director of the Institute of Hygiene. Emperors of various countries also awarded him high honors, and universities of various countries competed to send honorary degrees. In 1905, Koch also received the Nobel Prize in Medicine. He can be said to have reached the pinnacle of honor in the academic world. Today's treatment of tuberculosis is based on Koch's discovery. His contribution to saving lives and helping the world is truly something that the people of the world should be grateful for.</p>
<h3>(2) Dr. Berger of Germany</h3>
<p>Since Dr. Koch discovered that the tubercle bacillus is the pathogen of tuberculosis, tuberculosis scholars in the East and West have competed to study it, hoping to find a wonderful way to kill this bacterium. However, the results have all failed. Because most general physicians did not understand that the tubercle bacillus has a special structure. After Dr. Berger's painstaking research, he discovered that the tubercle bacillus has a special defense force that can resist the attack of all external drugs. The tubercle bacillus is composed of an inner membrane of neutral fat and an outer membrane of acid-fast wax. Unless a way is found to destroy its wax-like defense line and remove its fatty armor, there is no way to capture the tubercle bacillus and put it to death. Therefore, Dr. Berger, our great benefactor to lung disease patients all over the world, collected all kinds of animal, plant, and mineral medicines and researched them painstakingly for decades, exhausting countless brainpower and blood. Recently, he finally discovered that there is a special active ingredient in the compressed juice of the intermesenteric glands of special animals that has a strong dewaxing effect on the tubercle bacillus. This is truly a great success in the fundamental therapy of tuberculosis, a major question in the medical community for thousands of years.</p>

<p>(4) The Special Efficacious Therapy for Tuberculosis</p>
<p>The cause of tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is the tubercle bacillus. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms nodules at that location to cut off the blood circulation. The tubercle bacillus also secretes an acid-fast wax to surround its body to prevent the intrusion of all external drugs. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are used internally or by injection, they cannot reach the substance of the pathogen. The natural therapies, symptomatic therapies, physical therapies, serum therapies, drug therapies, and all other therapies that doctors have traditionally used have not been completely successful, and the saying that there is no medicine for lung disease is prevalent in the world because they do not know this profound theory. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the above-mentioned theory, continue to study tirelessly, and as a result, they have created this chemical holy medicine that kills all tubercle bacilli, called Sanosin. This medicine was invented based on the latest medical theories of Dr. Koch of Germany, the discoverer of the tubercle bacillus, and Dr. Berger of Germany, the inventor of tubercle bacillus dewaxing. According to the current experimental reports from various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this medicine has the effect of penetrating the nodules in the lung lesions and dissolving the wax, and it also has bactericidal power. It can fundamentally cure tuberculosis in the first, second, and third stages, and it truly has a special effect that is effective in every test. In China, it has been tested by the Central Health Experimental Institute of the National Government, and the medicinal properties are mild and non-toxic, and there are absolutely no side effects. A brief description of the therapeutic effects is listed below:</p>
<p>(1) If the medicinal power of "Sanosin" is tested in a test tube, the acid-fastness of all tubercle bacilli disappears after one minute, and after three minutes, the tubercle bacilli are completely killed, with no survivors.</p>
<p>(2) According to animal experiments, it was found that "Sanosin" can penetrate into the tuberculous lesions. If the latent tubercle bacilli in the lesions are examined, they all lose their acid-fastness. This proves that the wax is completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If the patient takes "Sanosin" internally for about a week, a good condition such as thinning of sputum and a decrease in body temperature can be seen immediately.</p>
<p>(4) If "Sanosin" is continued to be taken internally for 30 to 60 days or more, a significant increase in body weight, increased appetite, and gradual alleviation of all symptoms will be seen, eventually achieving the great achievement of recovery.</p>
<p>Free Sanosin experiment report and lung disease treatment guide will be sent upon request.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Council Meeting</h3>
<p>Officially Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>France Exerts All Efforts to Disrupt the German-Austrian Tax Agreement</p>
<p>Britain Moves to Submit to the International Court of Justice for Review</p>
<p>Nordic Delegation Assembles for Deliberations</p>
<p>Seeking Economic Liaison</p>
<p>Reuter, Geneva, 18th - The League of Nations Executive Committee meeting was officially opened this morning by British Foreign Secretary Henderson. British Foreign Secretary subsequently proposed that the German-Austrian Customs Agreement should be submitted to the Permanent International Court of Justice to clarify whether the content of the agreement is in conflict with the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the Geneva Agreement of October 1, 1922, and stated that the Court should be requested to handle this matter quickly and express its opinion. Subsequently, Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Schober made a statement in English stating that he unreservedly supported the British Foreign Secretary's proposal but argued that the actions of Austria and Germany did not violate the law. He also stated that Austria was willing to wait for the International Court of Justice to rule and after discussion by the League of Nations, to determine the direction of its progress. French Foreign Minister Briand also supported the British Foreign Secretary's proposal. German Foreign Minister Curtius and Italian Foreign Minister Grandi also agreed with the British Foreign Secretary's proposal. Thereupon, it was announced that the meeting would be adjourned and that the British Foreign Secretary's proposal would be voted on at 10:00 AM tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuter, Geneva, 18th - Last night, the German representative claimed that Austria and Germany were determined not to abandon their proposed customs union due to France's opposition, and that Austria's political independence would not be slightly impaired by this union. On Saturday and Sunday, French Foreign Minister Briand had pointed out that the German-Austrian Customs Union was illegal.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 17th - The League of Nations Rational Combination meeting will open tomorrow. This evening, the French delegation submitted a memorandum to the Secretariat attacking the German-Austrian Customs Agreement, pointing out that it violated the Treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain and the Geneva Protocol of 1922, insisting that Austria and Germany should temporarily suspend negotiations before the Council's decision. It is noted that the German-Austrian Tax Treaty is the centerpiece of this session's agenda. Austria and Germany insisted that the scope of discussion should be limited to purely legal points, while other countries wanted to include both political and economic aspects. According to international sources, the discussion may not be limited to the legal point in the future, but the actual action may not go beyond the legal position. Therefore, the result is likely to adopt the proposal of the British Foreign Secretary. In addition, the discussion events are: one is the final decision on the location and chairman of next year's Disarmament Conference. Currently, in addition to Geneva, the officially proposed meeting locations are Lausanne, Piari, Cannes, Barcelona, ​​Vichy, and Vienna. One is Germany's request to convene another international conference to discuss the issue of exchanging information on the development of civil aviation in various countries, so that it can be separated from the scope of the Disarmament Conference and avoid obstructing the success of the conference. These two points are more important in this session's agenda, and the remaining 30 or so minor issues are mostly related to specialized work and the League of Nations organization.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 17th - Today, the French delegation sent a letter of opinion directly to the German delegation regarding the German-Austrian Tax Treaty. This question is due to the gathering of chief representatives of various countries to communicate with each other daily, and there has never been a direct exchange of documents. Therefore, the French move was extremely surprising. Although the content of the opinion letter has not yet been made public, judging from the procedures it has taken, it is likely that France has openly rejected the continued discussion of the German-Austrian Tax Treaty issue, or even demanded the immediate withdrawal of the issue. Yesterday there was an激昂 debate between Germany and France, and today there was a direct delivery of official letters, so the conference situation is extremely tense.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 17th - The delegations of the Nordic countries in the Federal Committee, such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, held a joint meeting today to discuss certain economic issues. It is heard that the countries have decided that such meetings will be convened from time to time, and that they will take concerted action.</p>

<h3>Bombing of the Residence of the Japanese Minister of Finance</h3>
<p>Out of Intimidation</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 18th - As a result of the Metropolitan Police Department's investigation into the bombing incident at the residence of Finance Minister Inoue, the perpetrator's name, Masashi Takai, 31 years old, formerly a member of the Political Education Society, was finally obtained yesterday. Since February, he had organized the Overthrow the Cabinet Restoration League and began the movement to overthrow the cabinet, which eventually failed. Therefore, he wanted to end the matter by some method. As a result of various efforts, because he was familiar with the geography of the Finance Minister's residence since his youth, he knew that it was best to use a bomb explosion. Two weeks before the crime, he obtained two bombs from Oosawa, a member of the Restoration League, and began to implement it. At first, it seemed that he did not want to kill the Minister of Finance, but only to play a prank to vent his anger.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 18th - Repeated investigations into the bombing of Finance Minister Inoue's residence on May 3 now suggest that it was merely a plot by opponents to intimidate cabinet members and was not intended to cause harm. Similar actions are not uncommon. When the bomb exploded, only the glass windows were shattered, there was no other damage, and no one was injured. The next day, Inoue received a package containing a sword and a note stating that the sword was useful and could be used for self-defense in case of an assassination, implying intimidation and causing him anxiety. The police have now identified the person who sent the package, who is said to have admitted to being involved in the bombing. He is a restorationist who opposes the London Naval Treaty and the government's economic policies. There was also a restorationist who planned to knock on the door directly to oppose the naval treaty and the gold embargo, but was stopped by the police.</p>
<h3>Fascism Spreads Abroad</h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Publishes an Article</p>

Mussolini also opposes industrialism and focuses on the development of agriculture.</p>

<h3>Central Government and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>The Central Government also holds a memorial for Chen Qimei's martyrdom</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week for the late Premier and the 15th anniversary of Chen Qimei's martyrdom on the morning of the 18th. Attendees included Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Ding Weifen, Dai Chuanxian, Fang Juehui, Zhang Zhen, Chen Zhaoying, Zhang Daofan, Zeng Yangfu, Chen Guofu, He Chengjun, Yang Shuzhuang, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Liu Luyin, Yu Jingtang, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, and over twenty others. Guests included Han Fuqu, Jiang Bocheng, Ma Hongkui, and all staff members, totaling over a thousand people. Ding Weifen presided over the meeting, and Cai Yuanpei reported on Chen Qimei's life, stating that he possessed wisdom, benevolence, and courage. Chairman Chiang then gave a speech, stating that Chen Qimei was the Premier's most loyal, courageous, and capable follower and could serve as a model for all Party comrades. Now that the National Conference has been held, he hopes everyone will strive to realize the Three Principles of the People and achieve universal harmony to comfort the spirits of Mr. Chen and all the martyrs in heaven. After the speeches, the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a memorial week for the late Premier. Attendees included Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Shao Yuanchong, Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Peide, Yang Shuzhuang, He Yingqin, Bao Wenwei, Zhang Jinghui, Ru Yuli, Liu Shangqing, He Yaozu, Wang Zhengting, Zhou Fo-hai, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Yawei, Huang Bingheng, and over three hundred members of the National Government staff. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the attendees in paying respects. Shao Yuanchong then delivered a speech on the proceedings of the National Conference, briefly stating that in the 13th year of the Republic, the late Premier advocated for the convocation of a National Conference and traveled north with illness to realize it. Unfortunately, he passed away due to illness, and his aspiration was not realized during his lifetime. Before his death, he repeatedly instructed us to convene a National Conference, and his will clearly stated, "Peaceful struggle to save China" at his deathbed. We still remember this call to this day. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the convocation was delayed due to reactionary warlords. It was not until last year, after Yan and Feng were suppressed, that the Central Government decided to convene the National Conference, preparing for three months to hold the meeting as scheduled. There were three important tasks at this meeting: (1) Deciding on the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage. From now on, the basic law is established, and the steps for implementation will be decided accordingly. The Provisional Constitution contains clear provisions on the rights and obligations of citizens, the organization of the government, and the education and livelihood of the people in principle. After the closing of the conference, political and administrative facilities will have a certain track to follow. (2) Other construction and education plans, as well as the acceptance of the late Premier's entire legacy, are also extremely important. (3) After the closing of the conference, everyone will work hard on construction. Whether in politics or construction, they must follow the basic principles decided to complete the work of the Period of Political Tutelage. Secondly, there are some thoughts: 1. At this conference, the central government and the people jointly shouldered the responsibility of construction. Generally, the government often avoids the difficult and takes the easy, but the plan proposed by the government this time seems to increase the responsibility, urging themselves, which can well express the government's responsibility and its efforts. 2. During the period of political tutelage, the training of direct civil rights is the most important, and local autonomy is especially important. The preparation and election of this National Conference have greatly increased the people's experience. Now that the conference has closed, I hope the people of the whole country will unite in support of the central government, achieve peaceful unification, and implement the construction plan, so that the period of political tutelage will be completed as soon as possible and constitutional government will begin to realize the politics of the whole people, etc.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jinghui Takes Office as President of the Military Council</h3>
<p>Yu Youren Presides Over the Oath Ceremony</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Delivers Instructions</p>
<p>Zhang Jinghui, President of the Military Council, held an oath-taking ceremony on the morning of the 18th after the National Government's memorial week for the late Premier.

After Chairman Chiang led the attendees in paying respects, he first conferred the seal. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek conferred the seal, and Zhang Jinghui, President of the Military Council, received the seal. Next, the oath-taking ceremony was held, presided over by Central Committee member Yu Youren. Zhang raised his right hand, swore an oath, and read the oath. The presiding officer, Yu Youren, then delivered instructions, stating that Comrade Zhang has a deep reputation in the Northeast. Now that he has taken office as President of the Military Council, he will surely serve as a model for soldiers and will strive to complete the peaceful unification hoped for by this National Conference, to live up to the expectations of the Central Government and the people. Chairman Chiang then delivered instructions, stating that Comrade Zhang is highly respected, loves the country and the people, and has made great contributions to supporting the Central Government and completing unification. He deeply believes that after taking office, he will enable all soldiers to follow Comrade Zhang's spirit and perseverance under his guidance, support the Central Government, complete unification, and fulfill the revolutionary responsibility. Song Zhang Jinghui replied, stating that he is grateful for the encouragement from the Central Committee and the Chairman of the National Government. He will devote his humble abilities and loyalty to the Party and the country. He still hopes that comrades from the Party and the country will provide guidance from time to time to correct his shortcomings. After the reply, the music was played and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Communist Infiltration Discovered in Changsha Garrison Troops</h3>
<p>Battalion Commander Zhang Jiewu Was Originally a Red Bandit</p>
<p>Soldiers and Officers Newly Establish Joint Guarantee Law</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The 3rd Battalion of the Independent Regiment of the 31st Division was stationed in the provincial office of the division at the Yilao School in Juguan Temple, Changsha. Division Commander Tao Guang had gone to Hengzhou, leaving only Deputy Division Commander Zhou Xiwu in the province to oversee rear affairs. Deputy Division Commander Zhou Xiwu became suspicious of Battalion Commander Zhang Jiewu's unusual behavior and frequent interactions with suspicious individuals. A tip-off revealed that Zhang was an important member of the Red bandits, having served as the secretary of the Shishou County Party Committee of the Red Party. In April of last year, he received 5,000 yuan from the Red bandits to purchase guns and ammunition in Hunan to supply the Red bandits. This was intercepted by the local militia in Jiaoluo, Yuezhou. Now serving as a battalion commander, he is in fact carrying out secret orders from the Red Party to conduct military movement work in the province, hoping to seize the opportunity to launch a riot and attack Changsha. Furthermore, Red bandits Fan Shaoying from Jianli and Yu Yeqin from Shishou have brought funds to Hunan and are hiding in Zhang's home, plotting to collude with the military to cause chaos. After receiving the report, Deputy Division Commander Zhou investigated and found that Zhang lived at No. 19 Xinyun Street. He secretly discussed the matter with Peng Zhuo, the director of the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital, and decided that Peng would dispatch a team to Zhang's home for arrest at 2:00 AM on the 11th. At the same time, Deputy Division Commander Zhou secretly mobilized two battalions of troops to surround Zhang's unit in the middle of the night, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop. That night, Peng immediately dispatched a team of security guards to arrest Zhang and seven members of his family and detained them at the Public Security Bureau. Zhang's unit was also suddenly surrounded by Zhou's troops, who offered no resistance and surrendered their weapons. It can be said to be swift and efficient. The next day, all the captured personnel and prisoners were sent to the headquarters for interrogation. After investigation by Zhang Fenggang, the director of the Military Law Office, Zhang Jiewu confessed to being a member of the Red bandits, carrying out military movement work, and plotting to cause chaos in Changsha and assassinate key figures. Fan Shaoying confessed to working secretly in Jianli and Shashi, serving as the vice chairman and secretary general of the Huarong Soviet last year, and now being ordered by He Long and Yun Daiying to bring funds to Hunan, hide in Battalion Commander Zhang's home, and instigate military unrest. Yu Yeqin confessed to being the secretary of the Shishou County Committee, being recruited by Battalion Commander Zhang to bring funds to Hunan, planning to secure a position in the Opium Prohibition Bureau or the Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau, and going directly to Yuanjiang to secretly liaise with the Red bandits in Shishou, Huarong, and Anxiang counties. Director Zhang immediately sentenced Zhang, Fan, and Yu to death, tied them up, and executed them outside Liuyang Gate. The remaining prisoners are awaiting separate interrogation and sentencing. Liu Yinggu, the chief of staff acting as the commander of the Fourth Route Army, believed that it was extremely dangerous for the Red bandits to openly infiltrate the regular army, plot to cause trouble, and attack Changsha. He consulted with the military officers in the province and decided that Hunan soldiers would be organized into groups of five for mutual supervision. If one of the five is a Red bandit, all five would be held equally responsible. In addition, a joint responsibility method was established for officers. If a Red bandit is discovered in a platoon, the platoon leader is jointly responsible. If a Red bandit is discovered in a company, the company commander is jointly responsible. This is to be strictly enforced. (May 15)</p>
<h3>Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Pacification Army Besieges the Bandit Den of Jinjiazhai</h3>
<p>Ji's Division Arrives in Anhui Province, Ge and Li's Divisions Concentrate in Guangshan</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnants of Red bandit Kuang Jisun, along with the bandit forces of the pseudo-First Teaching Division Zhou Weijiong, Second Division Xiao Xie, Third Division Qi Deyi, and Fourth Division Liu Ying, fled from Hubei to southern Henan. After being surrounded and suppressed by various armies, they fled to the border of Anhui and took Jinjiazhai as their stronghold. In order to defend against the pursuit and suppression of the National Army, they stationed the main force of Zhou Weijiong's bandit troops in Banzhuyuan, with a small force stationed in the Shuanghe Tangjiahui Nanxi area. The main force of Xiao Xie's bandit troops was stationed in Yangjiadian, with a small force stationed in Yeji. Qi Deyi's bandit troops were stationed in Suxianshi and Zaohe, and Liu Ying's bandit troops were stationed in Beita Banbalitan to prepare for defense. Kuang Jisun himself was stationed in the old nest of Jinjiazhai. Traces of the bandits were also found in the Guangshan and Huoshan areas. Li Mingzhong, the pacification supervisor of the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei border area, believing that the bandits were entrenched and would inevitably cause great suffering to the people, ordered Ji Hongchang of the 30th Division, Zhang Yinxiang of the 31st Division, Ge Yunlong of the 33rd Division, Zhao Guantao of the 6th Division, Dai Minquan of the 25th Division, and Li Yunheng of the 53rd Division to encircle and suppress the bandits in separate routes. Ji's troops served as the vanguard and had already advanced to the border of Anhui. Zhang Yinxiang's division had also followed. Li Yunheng and Ge Yunlong's divisions were completely concentrated in Guangshan on the 15th and were set to depart soon. Zhao and Dai's divisions remained stationed in the Xinyang to Guangshui area. A total of no less than 50,000 to 60,000 troops were participating in the encirclement, suppression, and garrisoning. They will follow the planned plan and implement the encirclement. As soon as the deployment is complete, a general attack order will be issued. Li Mingzhong is still in the capital attending the National Conference and will return to Huangchuan to supervise the suppression after the conference closes. (May 16)</p>
<h3>The Ins and Outs of Kailuan Coal Mine Workers' Go-Slow Strike</h3>
<p>Mediation Committee Approves Transfer to Tianjin for Handling</p>
<p>Resolution of the Road-Mine Dispute Is Near</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: A month ago, the workers of the Kailuan Coal Mine, believing that the mine's annual operating surplus was around ten million yuan, while the treatment of workers was very harsh, made a request to the mine management to increase the daily wage by two jiao per person. Unexpectedly, the request for a wage increase was not met, but an order to stop work for two days a week was suddenly announced. The workers were even more dissatisfied, because even if the request for a wage increase was granted, it would only increase by about six yuan per month, but now stopping work for two days a week would result in a loss of about six yuan per month. Therefore, they implemented a go-slow strike on the 11th. The Provincial Department of Industry, fearing that the trend would expand after the workers raised the issue of increasing wages, had already requested the Provincial Government to establish a mediation committee in Tangshan before the go-slow strike to seek a solution. It sent staff member Ding Zhanmei to Tangshan to jointly organize with Ning Wu, the director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, Zhao Junda and Bo Lanting, representatives of the capitalists (foreigners), and Ni Changsheng and Zhang Yutang, representatives of the workers. On the day after Ding arrived in Tangshan, seeing that the workers had already implemented a go-slow strike, he immediately telegraphed Tianjin to ask for instructions. Wang Shuchang, the chairman of the Provincial Government, believing that there were more than 40,000 workers in Kailuan and that the situation there was extremely complicated, immediately telegraphed the Tangshan Public Security Bureau to order the workers to resume work immediately and at the same time instructed the Kailuan Mining Bureau to cancel the order to stop work for two days a week, pending a more complete solution. The Tangshan Labor Union, after accepting the authorities' persuasion, ordered the workers to resume work and work as usual on the morning of the 14th. At the same time, the Mediation Committee also announced its establishment and convened representatives from both labor and capital to implement mediation. However, Zhao Junda, the representative of the mine management, did not arrive, and Bo Lanting stated that he was not responsible, so the first round of mediation did not result in the mine management implementing the cancellation of the work stoppage order. Now, the capitalists, because there are many workers there and fearing accidents, requested that the Mediation Committee be transferred to Tianjin for handling. Ding Zhanmei, the representative of the Department of Industry, therefore returned to Tianjin to report to the Provincial Government. It is said that the Provincial Government has approved the transfer of the committee to Tianjin, and the workers' representatives will also come to Tianjin in the next few days. However, now that the workers have resumed work, the future consultations will focus on the two issues of the mine management canceling the work stoppage order and improving treatment. As for the cause of this labor-capital turmoil, it was actually caused by the road-mine dispute. It is said that after Hu Ruoyu, the mayor of Beiping, took office as the Kailuan Superintendent a few days ago, he invited Gao Jiyi and Yang Jiali (managers of the Kailuan Mining Bureau) to return to Tianjin. It is likely that the road-mine dispute will be resolved in the near future. (May 16)</p>
<h3>The Result of the Joint Investigation by Hunan and Hubei Provinces of the Case of the Changyue Customs</h3>
<p>Hubei Provincial Government Requests the Ministry of Finance to Recover Dike Donations</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the case of Yang Ren of Changyue Customs embezzling dike funds and offering bribes, the Hubei Provincial Government previously sent inspector Zhang Zexiong to Hunan Province to jointly investigate and report with the Hubei Provincial Committee and the Hubei provincial receiver Liu Dejun. Zhang and Liu have now returned to Hubei and specially submitted the results of the investigation to the provincial government on the 15th. All of Yang Ren's malfeasance and bribery are true. A total of more than 200,000 yuan of Hubei Province's dike donations were embezzled. The provincial government proposed 119 meeting discussions to resolve and request the Ministry of Finance to severely recover the funds. The following is a summary of Zhang and Liu's report: "Previously, we were ordered to jointly investigate the Yang Ren case with the Hunan Provincial Committee. We immediately jointly started an investigation with the members of the Hunan Provincial Government and the members of the Ministry of Finance. No one in charge of the customs station was present, and the criminals fled in droves, making it impossible to retrieve documents. We then decided to investigate the various taxes and Hunan Province pier donations received by the Tax Affairs Department. Because Changsha Customs collected dike donations at seven times the pier donations during Mao's term, we calculated it at ten times the amount. The Yuezhou Customs calculated it as 20% of the additional tax. One tael of silver was converted into silver dollars at a price of 1.55. From April to December of the 18th year, January to May, August to November of the 19th year, and January and February of the 20th year, we found that Changsha Customs should collect 700,000 yuan plus 7,284 yuan, 6 jiao, 5 fen, and 4 li. Even if some goods were exempted from donations, calculating the pier donations at ten times the amount and then reducing it by 30%, it should collect 495,099 yuan, 2 jiao, 6 fen, and 4 li. Yuezhou Customs should collect 114,815 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 fen, 5 li. The total dike donations to be collected by the two customs stations is 822,100 yuan, 0 jiao, 2 fen, and 9 li. Excluding the 459,313 yuan, 7 jiao, and 1 fen paid by the customs station to the Dike Project Management Committee, there is still a shortfall of 362,786 yuan, 5 jiao, and 2 fen, 9 li. Even if the pier donations of Changsha Customs are calculated at ten times the amount and then reduced by 30%, there is a shortfall of 150,601 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 fen, and 9 li in the dike donations to be paid. As for the fabricated loss case, we feel that the deception of this government is too much. According to conversations with various parties, the customs station did not lose any cash. According to the confession of Wang Jingping, a staff member of the customs station, he received 500 yuan in illegal cash, ten times his salary. From this, we can know that the entire loss was fabricated, calculating the embezzled fabricated loss dike donation at 98,785 yuan, 7 jiao, 1 fen, and 6 li. Even if Changsha Customs is calculated at ten times the amount of pier donations and then reduced by 30%, it also embezzled 73,958 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 li. Other malpractices such as unauthorized exemption or overcharging and private production of joint tickets are not included. That is, the customs station from April to December of the 18th year, January to May, August to November of the 19th year, and January and February of the 20th year, even calculated at 30%, has a total shortfall of 150,601 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 fen, and 9 li, and fabricated loss, also embezzling 73,958 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 li in dike donations. The total embezzlement of dike project surcharges from this province is more than 200,000 yuan. It is reasonable to submit the evidence list for review." (May 15)</p>
<h3>The East Railway Will Connect with Various Railways in the Northeast</h3>
<p>The Communications Committee Dispatches Personnel to Contact the East Railway Bureau</p>
<p>Satisfactory Results Have Been Obtained from Both Sides' Talks</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zou Zhiqian, the director of the Road Administration Office of the Northeast Communications Committee, along with Guo Xurun, the director of the Jichang and Jidun Railway Bureau, went to Harbin together. It is said that their mission on the surface is to inspect the railways of the Eastern Provinces, but in fact, they have the important mission of contacting the Eastern Railway and the domestic railways of the Northeast for joint transportation. The Communications Committee received a confidential telegram from Li Shaogeng, the acting director of the Eastern Railway, last month, which stated that the Eastern Railway's transportation has been exhausted in recent years, and its business has been depressed. The board of directors and supervisors proposed that in order to reverse the decline and develop, it is necessary to conduct joint transportation with the Northeast railways. Please telegraph for consultation if you agree. Gao Jiyi, the chairman of the committee, has always had an active development plan for the Northeast railways under his jurisdiction and has long had a major plan to connect with Europe and Asia. He expressed great agreement with Li's telegram and consulted with the directors of the Northeast Railway Bureau and the director of the Road Administration Office of the committee, Zou Zhiqian, and the chief of the Second Section, Zou En-yuan, who all agreed. Zou En-yuan also suggested taking this opportunity to propose superior conditions to the Eastern Railway. Gao agreed and instructed the two Zous to draft their opinions and sent Zou Zhiqian and Guo Xurun to Harbin for the first contact. It was also planned that if they entered into specific consultations, Guo Xurun would take the lead, and other cadres from the committee would be transferred to assist him. After Zou and Guo arrived in Harbin, they had long secret talks at the official residence of the Russian director of the Eastern Railway, Lude Yi. Lude Yi hoped to implement joint transportation with the neighboring Hu-Hai and Qi-Ke railways first, and then with other railways. However, the main point of the Communications Committee was to handle all the railways at the same time and proposed three measures: (1) When joint transportation is implemented, the China Eastern Railway must try its best to reduce transportation prices. The purpose of this joint transportation is not only to seek the development of each other, but also to compete with the South Manchuria Railway. It is necessary to reduce transportation prices to attract more customers. (2) The China Eastern Railway is concerned about the construction of various ports (such as Yingkou Huludao Qinhuangdao) by the Northeast railways and must provide financial or material assistance. Most of the export ports in the Northeast are crude and simple due to economic relations, which cannot compete with Dalian and other places. Since the China Eastern Railway is conducting joint transportation with the Northeast railways, the expansion and construction of various ports is essential. (3) If the Northeast railways feel the lack of locomotives and vehicles when implementing joint transportation with the China Eastern Railway, the China Eastern Railway must use vehicle compression methods to find ways to subsidize the lack of vehicles in the Northeast railways to avoid stagnation. Lude Yi, the Russian director of the East Railway, replied separately to this request, saying that for the first item, as long as it is beneficial to both parties, he will try to reduce it as much as possible within the possible scope. For the second item, the China Eastern Railway is currently financially exhausted and may not be able to meet the hopes of the Communications Committee, but it will also do its best to assist. For the third item, the East Railway uses a wide gauge, which is different from the tracks of the Northeast railways, which is not without difficulty. However, various European countries are now using the quasi-axis adjustment method, which allows the axles to move and can be freely expanded and contracted. Technical personnel should consider the design. Finally, he said that as long as the board of directors agrees to the above three items, he has no objection and finally proposed a specific draft plan for Zou to consider. It is said that both parties were quite sincere in this meeting, so they both considered it satisfactory. Now Zou has submitted the situation to Gao for review. (May 14)</p>
<h3>Liaoning Province Assists Various Counties with Spring Plowing</h3>
<p>Allocates 1.2 Million Yuan to Various Counties</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The economy of the Northeast has been bankrupt in recent years, and the people's livelihood has been declining. In addition, the west of Liaoning suffered a flood last autumn, and the local financial situation has become even more urgent. The authorities, considering the hardships of the people, allocated a huge amount of 20 million yuan last winter to lend to farmers and merchants to alleviate their urgent needs. Since the new spring, the grain stored by middle-class farmers has mostly been sold at low prices last winter, leaving little surplus grain, and food is insufficient, making spring plowing difficult. At a time when bandits have not been pacified and the Communist Party is lurking, if the people's hardship is not resolved as soon as possible, it will be difficult to secure local security. The Liaoning and Ning Provincial Governments, aware of the situation, decided to allocate 260,000 yuan of the relief funds raised by the flood relief associations to each county based on the severity of the disaster and lend it to each county for spring plowing. For other counties that are feeling the aftermath of the disaster and are experiencing tight financial conditions and are unable to carry out spring plowing, the Department of Civil Affairs was ordered to make overall plans. It is said that a total of 1.8 million yuan is needed for 23 counties. The first batch decided to withdraw 1.2 million yuan of silver dollars from the official silver house and provide assistance to the most important counties and the disaster-stricken counties that have already received assistance due to the insufficient allocation. Spring loans will be repaid in the autumn with reduced interest. Loan procedures should be as simple as possible to avoid delaying the agricultural season. Regulations were also established for the official silver house to handle the loans directly with the county branches according to the amount of each county's share, and the county finance bureau and agricultural association were to issue the loans in their names, with the county government bearing the responsibility for guaranteeing the loans. On the one hand, the finance bureau and agricultural association organized a spring plowing loan assistance office to investigate the number of mu of land that the people in the territory are unable to cultivate and allocate the funds on a per-mu average to households with guaranteed loans, setting the repayment period for November and December of this year. If there are indeed difficulties, it can be postponed for one year. If any borrower privately lends the funds for profit without engaging in spring plowing, and it is discovered or reported, the loan will be recovered, and the borrower and guarantor will be punished to prevent abuses. As for other counties that are not included in the assistance, because their situation is not urgent, they will be considered later after the situation is reviewed in the future. Currently, the counties that have been designated to receive assistance include Faku, Shuangshan, Liaoyuan, Kangping, Lishu, Huaide, Taonan, Xiuyan, Jinchuan, Huinan, Xinbin, Liuhe, Xinmin, Panshan, Jin County, Tai'an, Suizhong, Zhangwu, Heishan, Liaozhong, Beizhen, Xingcheng, Yixian, Jinxi, Changtu, Kaitong, Andong, Tongliao, Tuquan, Zhanyu, etc. (May 15)</p>
<h3>The Rescued Miners of Lieshan Have Been Released</h3>
<p>The Mining Area is Protected by the Gong Regiment</p>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu: At the Lieshan Coal Mine in Suxian, earlier this month, an incident occurred involving the arrest of workers by the Li Battalion of the 39th Regiment of the 7th Division of the Suixi Garrison during an inspection of the mining area. Over a thousand miners went on strike as a result. The general manager of the company, Lu Zidong, went to Xu and negotiated with the authorities of the 7th Division, obtaining a promise from the military leaders to instruct the Li Battalion to release the arrested workers promptly. Lu then traveled from Xu to Su to request Gong Chaomei, the regimental commander of the 39th Regiment of the division, to dispatch a unit to protect the mine. Permission was granted, and Lu returned to Bengbu. According to company personnel, Xu Ziqin, the general manager of the Engineering Department in charge of the miners, and over thirty other workers arrested by the Li Battalion of Suixi, have all been released. It is said that work will resume as soon as the troops dispatched by the Gong Regiment arrive at the mine. From this observation, the Lieshan incident seems to have reached a temporary conclusion. However, various party and government organs, public organizations, and local gentry in Suxian have accused the Lieshan mining area of harboring bandits and harming the local area. Therefore, a meeting was specially convened at the Finance Bureau to discuss several countermeasures (these measures were briefly mentioned in yesterday's newspaper). However, according to a Mr. Fu from the Lieshan Coal Mine Company, the recent arrest of miners by the Suixi garrison was entirely due to a misunderstanding. The area around Lieshan is entirely bandit territory, but he believes that none of the mine's personnel are colluding with bandits. The workers who come to the mine all have a chain of guarantors, and he cannot be sure if there are any undesirable elements among them. As for the bandits captured by the garrison with coal dust on their clothes, it is possible that they infiltrated abandoned mine shafts to hide when being pursued by the troops. Furthermore, the mine's police have captured bandits and recovered hostages near the mining area, which shows that they are definitely not harboring bandits. He believes that the local people in Suxian are using this as an opportunity to attack them, and they are not being understanding of the mine. (May 16)</p>
<p>Another letter from the Lieshan Coal Mine Company stated: The reports in the newspapers about the strike at their mine have been vague and may cause misunderstandings. They are providing the following account of the facts to clarify the truth. The area around the mine is inherently bandit territory. Last year, the Second Brigade of the Anhui Provincial Garrison was stationed in the mountains to protect the mine. Later, due to orders to redeploy, they requested the Seventh Division of the Jinpu Railway Garrison Command to dispatch a team for protection. Commander Wang agreed to dispatch them after concentrated training and review. For several months, incidents of kidnapping and robbery have been heard daily near the mining area. Due to the mine's weak police force, they were unable to suppress them. The local gentry, concerned about the increasing harm to the area, pleaded with the Gong Regiment of the Seventh Division to dispatch a team to suppress the bandits. The Li Battalion of that regiment was incredibly brave and captured and killed the bandits in the Caili area, who had been a scourge to the area for a long time. The local people and the mine's employees were deeply grateful. However, when Battalion Commander Li was returning to Suixikou from Caili, his horse was wounded by bandits as he passed through the North Street of the Kunlian mining area. Suspecting that the workers were colluding with the bandits, he arrested over twenty of them. Fortunately, Regimental Commander Gong Liangqing considered both bandit suppression and mine protection, and his officers and soldiers were fair and impartial. After interrogation, they realized that the workers were innocent and released them all. Because the mine has no garrison, they feared that bandits might infiltrate the mine, so they took the opportunity to suspend work to help the local area eliminate banditry. Now the Garrison Command and the Gong Regiment have ordered teams to be stationed at the mine for protection, and banditry can be eliminated from now on. Fearing that rumors may be inaccurate, they are providing this account of the events. May 17.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Fujian Merchant Guilds Have Been Released</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou: The various merchant guilds of Fujian were opposing the allocation of treasury bond quotas, and twenty-five representatives were arrested by the Public Security Bureau. At the same time, Chen Guang, the legal advisor of the silk and cloth guild, was also detained by the Security Bureau. This caused a great uproar among the merchant guilds. On the afternoon of the 13th, over a hundred people gathered and went to the Provincial Party Headquarters with banners to request assistance. The Provincial Party Headquarters sent a letter to the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Government ordered the Security Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to release the representatives and Chen Guang on the morning of the 14th. The guilds then sent people in fifteen cars to welcome Chen Guang at the Security Bureau and then to the Public Security Bureau to welcome the representatives. Firecrackers were set off along the way. Also, the Lawyers' Association, seeing that Chen Guang had regained his freedom, also resumed his duties that afternoon and appeared in court as usual. However, the various merchant guilds all suspect that Zheng Shouxin, the chairman of the Fuzhou General Chamber of Commerce, colluded with the government to frame the merchants in this incident. On the 15th, they issued a declaration attacking Zheng without reservation and submitted a petition to the County Party Headquarters, stating that the Chamber of Commerce had become ineffective and requesting that it be ordered to cease operations.

<h3>Tobacco Seedlings Discovered in Zhao'an, Fujian</h3>
<p>Totaling Over 8,000 Mu</p>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou: The Tobacco Prohibition Committee recently received a report from the Tobacco Prohibition Inspector of Zhao'an County, stating that the Second and Fourth Districts of Zhao'an are close to Raoping and Pinghe Huanggang in Guangdong. The area is remote and mountainous, and the villagers are strong and fierce. Extortion is common, and they ignore the tobacco prohibition order. Recently, the villages of Taipingxu, Xiage, and Xiuzhuan have been planting tobacco from house to house, spreading over a hundred li. The Xiage District and Taipingxu each have over 3,000 mu of tobacco seedlings, and Xiuzhuan Village has over 2,000 mu of tobacco seedlings, totaling no less than 8,000 mu. They are currently harvesting the tobacco. The inspector also sent a paper box containing five tobacco blossoms to the Prohibition Committee, requesting that the garrison be instructed to quickly eradicate them to clear the poisonous plants.

<h3>The Qingdao Public Security Bureau Has Repeatedly Cracked Banditry Cases</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Qingdao: Yu Jinhe, the director of the Qingdao Public Security Bureau, pays great attention to arresting bandits. Whenever bandits from neighboring areas sneak into Qingdao, they are always caught. Recently, in the past week, as many as five cases have been cracked. The details are as follows: (1) Cui Weiyuan, a bandit who had previously kidnapped and extorted money in Jiaoxian County, fled to Dalian to hide after being dispersed by the troops. Recently, he suddenly returned to Qingdao. In early April, he joined bandits Chen Si and Wang Shouchen to kidnap three hostages in Zhangjiazhuang and Lijiaxiazhuang in Jiaoxian County, extorting over 3,000 yuan. They were subsequently captured by the detective team and have been taken to the bureau for interrogation. (2) Wei Huayao, Wei Huachi, Yu Qingwen, and other bandits who committed arson, murder, robbery, and kidnapping in Boxing County, recently came to Qingdao and hid in Guangzhou Road and Yunnan Road. The Boxing County government sent Wang Zhiqin, the head of the Joint Village Association, to Qingdao to report this. The Public Security Bureau ordered the detective team to arrest them, and they were taken by the Boxing County government to be tried. (3) Ma Jixiang, a fugitive bandit from Boxing, is currently hiding in Cangkou. He was reported by someone, and the Fifth Public Security Branch arrested Ma Jixiang in the Zhongyuan Yarn Factory dormitory. He is currently being held at the bureau. (4) On the 9th of this month, Zhu Guangting, the quartermaster of the Shandong Provincial People's Corps Headquarters, together with the detective team of the Public Security Bureau, searched for the bandit leader Zeng Jikui at the Lianting Zhan in Dagang but did not find him. They arrested two bandits, Shi Guangzhong and a suspect, Ma Lianyuan. Zhu Guangting took these two on the 14th to the headquarters for interrogation. (5) On the 10th of this month,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The Fifth Branch Bureau arrested Wang Chuncheng, a fugitive bandit from Boxing, at No. 11 Qingyang Road, Cangkou. During interrogation, he confessed to kidnapping in Boxing. They sent a letter to the Boxing County government requesting them to send someone to Qingdao to take custody of him. (May 15)</p>

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>The Patrol Team Captures Bandits and Transfers Them to the County: Two net boats were previously docked near Doufubang outside the south gate of our county. The local villagers, finding the boats suspicious, reported it to the Patrol Team. The police were dispatched and captured three bandits on the spot, finding a considerable amount of clothing and items. After a preliminary interrogation at the department, they were transferred to the county government for legal action. A Gale Capsizes a Joss Boat, Killing Over Twenty People: On the 28th day of the third month of the lunar calendar, traditionally the birthday of the Eastern Peak Great Emperor, the pilgrimage to Jinze Town in the Fifth District of the western part of our county is very grand. On this day, pious men and women from all over formed teams to go to the temple to offer incense. Three joss boats came from Xitang. About three li from the town, they were suddenly hit by a gale. All three boats capsized at the same time, and the pilgrims fell into the water. The sounds of people shouting and crying were deafening. Fortunately, people nearby tried their best to rescue them.

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Wang Er Rapes a Young Girl: Feng, a resident of Jiangbei in Houbang, has a daughter named Xiaoshanzi, who is twelve years old. The previous night, she was lured to Wang Er's home by a fellow villager, Wang Er, who committed an indecent act. Xiaoshanzi's lower body was injured. Her mother found out and went to reason with Wang, but he had already fled. Xiaoshanzi was sent to the hospital for treatment.

<p>District Chief Shen Leads a Team to Suppress Lake Bandits: Recently, lake bandits have been appearing in the villages of Wuxian County. Although the water and land police teams have tried their best to pursue and suppress them, they have been running from east to west, causing local worries. On the morning of the 18th, District Chief Shen of the Third Water Public Security District received a report stating that many bandit ships and over a hundred lake bandits had been discovered on the east and west sides of Dongting. District Chief Shen immediately boarded the Zhenwei patrol ship and led a team to suppress them.</p>
<p>Examination of the Tragedy at the Competition: A farmers' competition was held in Xiangcheng Township, and a melee occurred. The township's merchant corps and security corps went to the scene to suppress the violence and fired warning shots. Stray bullets killed a villager named Xi Ashou and drowned a Mr. Lü, and injured over twenty people. It is now learned that the local court sent Prosecutor Lai to the township on the 18th to inspect the scene. It was confirmed that Xi Ashou died from a box gun bullet, and the family was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. However, it has not been determined whether the merchant corps or the security corps fired the shot, as both had box guns. Two injured people, Li Shoutang and Hou Renchu, came to the city on the 18th and petitioned the local court for an inspection. They also accused Hou Liancheng, an officer of the security corps, of instigating the shooting. It is heard that before the competition, various slogans threatening the government were discovered in the township, such as, "If the county government prohibits the competition, we will all refuse to pay taxes." and "If the Public Security Bureau prohibits the competition, if there is a plague or disease in the township, we will negotiate with the Public Security Bureau." It is said that the person nicknamed "the local emperor" in the township was the initiator of the competition. The court plans to summon the people involved for questioning tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Stealing Bamboo Shoots Turns into a Tragedy: Wu Rongquan, a villager from the Ditianxia area of the Tenth District, was passing by the Dongqiaotou area in the eastern suburbs yesterday morning when he saw the thriving bamboo shoots in Cao A'gen's bamboo forest. He was tempted by the small profit and entered the forest to dig up the bamboo shoots with a knife, tied them into a bundle, and carried them out of the forest. Suddenly, he was spotted by a villager, someone A, who shouted "Thief!" The villagers in the area heard the sound and rushed to grab Rongquan. Without asking for an explanation, they punched and kicked him. Then they used an iron hairpin to stab Rongquan hard in the left leg. Blood immediately flowed like a fountain, and Rongquan was seriously injured, lying in a pool of blood, gasping for breath, and on the verge of death. The villagers knew they had caused trouble and carried Rongquan to the wheat field in front of Cao Xiang and fled separately. After a while, he was spotted by a passerby, who reported it to the First Sub-District of the direct jurisdiction. Inspector Yu, upon receiving the report, immediately sent a chief police officer to investigate and arrest Cao A'gen, the perpetrator, and then transferred him to the head office for review.</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Expect the Package System to Be Cancelled for Electricity: Tao Nianzu, Yan Juezhi, and 800 households, including the Jingyi Tang and Zhang Yimao stores, in the urban area of our county, requested Director Wu of the Qishuyan Power Plant to respect public opinion, cancel the package system, and restore the original price, as the Wuxi City electricity bill has effectively been 18 cents since May 1st. It is now learned that Director Wu, after receiving the letter, sent Yang Huaigu, the resident commissioner in Wuxi, to visit Yan Juezhi and inquire about everything. After two conversations, the two sides reached an agreement. The power plant believes that at a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, the raw materials for electricity are soaring, and coal prices are rising, even canceling the 10% discount would not compensate for the reality. Therefore, there is no room for maneuver regarding the actual receipt of 18 cents. However, they promised that once the price of gold decreases, they will first restore the price to the previous level and then charge a 10% discount as before. If the price of gold rises again in the future and the electricity price increases, they will first seek the consent of the citizens before making an announcement. Mr. Yan believes that although the power plant has adopted public opinion to show goodwill, there is no real guarantee for canceling the package system and abolishing unequal treaties. It is difficult to hope that the electricity price will be cancelled before the price of gold returns. Based on these three points, he still plans to continue to demand to avoid chaos.</p>
<p>A Large Gang of Lake Bandits Looted Fenshuidun: It has been reported in this newspaper that over twenty bandit ships were discovered in the Fenshuidun area at the intersection of Xiwuyi. Mao Mujun, the district chief of the Second District of the Xiwu Water Police, sent the Hongping and Baosu warships to mashan on Taihu Lake to suppress them. It is now learned that there were over thirty lake bandits on the bandit ships, all armed with guns. After arriving in the town, they searched every household. After about two hours, they left with their loot. It is estimated that seven or eight stores, including Sun Shunxing Nanhua store and Qu Shuntai Nanhua store, were looted, with a total loss of approximately one thousand yuan. When the lake bandits left, they kidnapped a certain Ms. Liu, the eldest daughter-in-law of Liu Qinsheng, a resident of the town, and a granddaughter. Wang Wenlin, the owner of the Tongtai Nanhua store, and the young clerk of the Gongshun Hotel, Zhang Jinhai, were also kidnapped to the bandit ship. They immediately set sail, drumming and paddling towards Taihu Lake. Afterwards, the families of those kidnapped were very anxious and hoped that the authorities would find a way to rescue them so that they could reunite with their loved ones.</p>
<p>An Elderly Man in His Sixties Rapes a Young Girl: Ye Ziping, also known as Ye Mazi, a resident of the Kutang Bridge area outside the south gate of our county, is 61 years old and fond of beauty. He currently runs a Kefu lead shop in the area and is financially well-off. The other day, Ye saw Xie Axi, a seventeen-year-old female worker in workshop number 63 of the Taifu Silk Factory under the Taa Bridge. Struck by her beauty, he immediately broke into Axi's room and committed rape. Axi refused and shouted for help. Seeing the situation was bad, Ye immediately fled. At that time, neighbors heard the sound and came to ask what was happening. Axi considered the matter a matter of honor and committed suicide by grabbing a kitchen knife in the kitchen. She was rescued by people and nothing happened. Afterwards, the neighbors reported the information to the third police station of the third branch of the Public Security Bureau. The police took Ye Ziping and Xie Axi to the police station and transferred them to the second branch. After a preliminary trial by Director Wang, Ye Ziping was sentenced for improper conduct and fined seven yuan, and Xie Axi was fined five yuan as a warning. Before both parties left the bureau, the woman Xie Axi, because the suicide attempt was unsuccessful, jumped into the river and tried to drown. She was rescued by people and was not submerged. It is heard that the people of Nanli believe that Ye Ziping dared to rape a woman and actually obstructs local customs. It is planned to file a complaint within the day to serve as a warning.</p>

When he went to Situ Temple to take a rest in the tea shop, Zhang learned of it and led many of his gangsters to seize Shao and break his head with an iron weapon. Zhang and the others saw their goal had been achieved and scattered. However, Shao was seriously injured and has been taken to the city for examination.

Each of them was holding a wooden stick and they swarmed in. They overturned boxes and cabinets, stealing clothing, silver, and other items worth over a hundred yuan. One of the bandits, named Zhu Zhengkui, noticed that Pan's daughter-in-law (nicknamed Dalianzi) was beautiful and became lustful. He grabbed Dalianzi and intended to rape her. Pan's wife, Yu, saw this and went outside to beat the gong and shout, "Catch the thieves!" The other bandits also chased after her and grabbed Yu, hitting her hard with a stick, causing her serious injuries. This alarmed the people of the whole village who came to rescue them. They captured Zhu Zhengkui and Chen Jiaming on the spot and reported to the Second Squad of the First Company of the police stationed in Sanzhaozhen.

<p>Discussion on Trade News</p>
<h3>Reading Mr. Shang Zhongyi's "Further Discussion on Children's Reading Materials" Made Me Realize That "Talking Birds and Animals" Really Doesn't Need to Be Abolished - Wu Yan Yin</h3>
<p>Mr. Shang's "Further Discussion on Children's Reading Materials" seems to be directed at those who "support fantastical fairy tales." However, his answer to my question was not entirely satisfactory. Although not entirely satisfactory, I still find it quite acceptable.</p>
<p>After hastily reading Mr. Shang's work, the atmosphere felt very tense. It seemed as if Chinese elementary school textbooks were full of the "fantastical fairy tales" Mr. Shang mentioned, and many followers of "fantastical fairy tales" were loudly advocating for them. The one raising the question, myself, was portrayed as the chief culprit "supporting fantastical fairy tales." In reality, I can reassure Mr. Shang with a joke: our country's elementary school textbooks have never been like American textbooks. There isn't much material related to "fantastical fairy tales" at all. Textbooks on so-called nature, society, or general knowledge certainly have none, and even in language textbooks, there are very few. As for people who support "fantastical fairy tales," Mr. Shang's essay seems to be targeting me specifically. But Mr. Shang has misunderstood. Although I am unenlightened, I would never become a loyal servant of "fantastical fairy tales." My attitude is the same as Mr. Shang's, believing that we should "carefully select and retain first-rate fairy tales with artistic value and entertainment interest." If Mr. Shang were to look at the various restrictions on selecting materials for language education in the Ministry of Education's Provisional Curriculum Standards for Elementary School Language, he wouldn't have this misunderstanding. It's not that I believe Mr. Shang's remarks are "shooting without a target." In the future, Chinese elementary school textbooks might mistakenly become like American textbooks, filled with "fantastical fairy tales," and I would need Mr. Shang's guidance. Mr. Shang's words make us "choose even more carefully" in the future, which is indeed very good.</p>
<p>The above is a response to misunderstandings in Mr. Shang's "Further Discussion on Children's Reading Materials."</p>
<p>As for what Mr. Shang should have answered me, it is the most crucial question: "Are talking birds and animals the same as supernatural stories?" Mr. Shang did not explicitly answer this question, which I consider not entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>I believe that some talking bird and animal stories use "personification," while others are natural stories explaining life. They are fundamentally different from the records in "Investiture of the Gods" or "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio." They cannot be confused with supernatural stories, nor can they be confused with "fantastical fairy tales." Of course, many supernatural stories and "fantastical fairy tales" do involve talking birds and animals, but there are also many talking bird and animal stories with no supernatural elements and not necessarily containing fantasy. For example, the "Hurry, Cuckoo" in bird language poetry encourages farmers, and the questions and answers in "The Cat and the Snail" (see the New Language Textbook, Book 5) explain the snail's life. Where is there any strange or fantastical element in these? Mr. Shang previously confused talking birds and animals with supernatural stories and had an absolute claim that "lower grades… should not use talking bird and animal stories." This time, he again confuses talking birds and animals with "fantastical fairy tales," truly making one mistake after another. However, in this essay, Mr. Shang revealed his agreement with my saying of "no need to abolish" talking bird and animal stories. He said, "Greatly reduce the number of fairy tales, choose even more carefully… stories like 'Elephant Boy' from Jilin might as well be retained." If we examine "Elephant Boy," the elephant talks to ostriches, giraffes, pythons, and crocodiles. It not only has talking birds and animals but also talking snakes and crocodiles. The story that the elephant's trunk was originally short but was pulled long by a crocodile contains supernatural and fantastical elements (see the translation in the book "So It Is" published by Kaiming Bookstore). Someone in China's elementary school education system still dares to use this kind of teaching material, yet Mr. Shang advocates for retaining it, meaning Mr. Shang's approval of talking bird and animal stories is even more advanced than ours. This is powerful proof that Mr. Shang acknowledges the need not to abolish talking bird and animal stories.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Shang did not explicitly answer my question "Are talking birds and animals the same as supernatural stories?", he has indeed approved of talking bird and animal stories. That is why I say that although Mr. Shang's answer is not entirely satisfactory, I still find it acceptable.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Shang approves of talking bird and animal stories, why do I need to say more? I am only afraid that the elementary school education community in our country and the general public concerned about elementary school education have not understood Mr. Shang's intentions and have become confused by our discussions, instead sympathizing with the provincial government chairman's so-called "abolish talking bird and animal stories" rhetoric.</p>
<p>Tragically, just when our country's elementary school textbooks were beginning to "childify," the old society immediately condemned them as "cat and dog textbooks." If we do not recognize Mr. Shang's profound arguments and mistakenly believe that Mr. Shang also opposes "cat and dog textbooks," then textbooks filled with "heaven, earth, sun, moon," "human hands, feet, knife" might be resurrected. If they really are resurrected, the loss to children will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Finally, I must also ask everyone to pay attention: fairy tales certainly include some myths and animal stories (not all, because many myths and animal stories cannot be considered fairy tales), but there are also two types of animal stories: one containing fantastical elements and the other being natural stories. Although Mr. Shang's remarks are not very supportive of animal stories, he has not opposed "natural stories." If we are to edit elementary school textbooks in the future, don't misunderstand Mr. Shang's meaning and become afraid to use "natural stories." I also hope that Mr. Shang will lead by example and create one or two model Chinese children's reading materials from scratch, so that I can truly understand the "New Garden" in my mind. If he could create one or two textbooks for children across the country to read, I would offer fervent prayers and be delighted for the children of the nation.</p>
<p>As an aside, I am currently rushing to complete a language textbook for lower grades full of natural stories (not avoiding talking bird and animal stories). I have no time to discuss this further. I hope Mr. Shang will, in addition to the question of "Are talking birds and animals the same as supernatural stories and should be abolished?", refrain from making remarks that are not very relevant to this topic. Otherwise, not only will we stray too far from the topic, but I will also not dare to discuss with Mr. Shang again.</p>

<h3>All Circles Support the Declaration to Abolish Unequal Treaties</h3>
<p>Ninth District Party Headquarters: The Ninth District Party Headquarters of this city issued a declaration yesterday, stating that the National Assembly, following the Generalissimo's teachings and with a fearless spirit, resolutely and automatically announced the abolition of unequal treaties, washing away all humiliating insults, defending the survival of the Chinese nation, eliminating obstacles to global peace, and realizing the dawn of world harmony. All our compatriots, upon hearing this, were filled with joy. Recalling that since the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War, for more than eighty years, our country has been bound by unequal treaties. Our native products have been driven out by foreign goods, leading to successive bankruptcies, economic depression, and national decline to the extreme. Thinking of this, we feel extremely heartbroken. In the past, our country repeatedly proposed treaty revisions to the great powers, but those imperialists, hoping to prolong the life of unequal treaties and seeking to absorb our country's economic lifeline, evaded and delayed, and have not yet allowed it. Recently, the representatives of the National Assembly, representing the will of all the people of our country, in order to awaken the illusions of those imperialists, announced the declaration of treaty abolition to the world. All comrades in this district, as long as we have a breath left, will vow to support it to the end, regardless of any difficulties or sacrifices. We hope that all compatriots across the country will unite and support us as the government's backing. This is what we hope and pray for. We hereby declare.</p>
<p>Various Trade Associations: Over a hundred trade associations, including the Nanshi Native Products Industry, Floral Powder Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Seafood and Sundries Industry, etc., yesterday issued a declaration supporting the National Assembly's declaration to abolish unequal treaties, stating: (Titles omitted) The crimes of unequal treaties not only shackle the Chinese nation but also hinder world peace. Today, the National Assembly, following the Generalissimo's teachings and based on the demands of the people, is using decisive means to automatically declare their abolition. The Chinese nation is fortunate to be rid of these shackles and is deeply gratified. Friendly countries are not lacking in people who uphold justice and righteousness, and they will also deeply sympathize with the elimination of obstacles to world peace. However, at the beginning of this abolition, if any imperialists do not reflect and realize the truth and attempt to cling to illegally seized interests, sparing no effort to obstruct and destroy, then the Chinese nation, although weak, will have the strength to deal with them fully. Merchants from all industries, who have suffered the most deeply for eighty years, are especially willing to do their utmost to vow to support the government's diplomacy as a backing, so as to thoroughly complete this task. We hereby declare, and we hope that you will understand.</p>

<h3>Meat Merchants Throughout the City Remained Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Meat Merchants in the Concession Resolved to Stop Importing Goods</p>
<p>The fresh meat industry in this city has been practicing slaughter cessation and business closure since the 16th due to the slaughter tax issue. Yesterday, the industry in the concession formally held a meeting and decided to act in unison from today onwards. The information obtained yesterday is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Mayor's Talk: Mayor Zhang and Hu Qianxi came to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday and met with reporters who visited him to discuss the situation regarding the dispute over the collection of slaughter tax. He said, "In handling matters, I have always advocated dealing with everything in a peaceful manner and have never had any preconceptions. I have always accommodated the opinions of the public as much as possible as long as they are reasonable. According to the investigation of this slaughter tax dispute, it is not the intention of all meat merchants, but a few local ruffians and unscrupulous merchants who hope to maintain the contract donation system, using the donation money paid by the meat merchants to fill their own pockets, except for paying a small amount of donation. They know that the municipal government's recovery of self-management will greatly hinder their private interests, so they cannot help but incite and instigate disturbances. However, the citizens should understand that (1) the slaughter tax is not a new tax. This tax exists everywhere, and it has been implemented in this city for a long time. In the past, it was collected by the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office. Recently, in order to unify the governing power, it was changed to be collected and remitted by the Shanghai Municipal Government on behalf of the office; (2) the slaughter tax rate has not increased, and the burden on meat merchants has not increased; (3) the collection procedures are striving to be simple, only providing convenience to merchants and citizens, and there is no harshness. The above are all facts, and all parties should understand them. In short, the contractor system has many drawbacks, and it is necessary to eliminate it in this era. The municipal government will never change its established principles in order to maintain the private interests of a few contractors. I hope that enlightened merchants and citizens will not be used by unscrupulous merchants, causing the disturbances to be prolonged and suffering losses themselves. I also hope that the press will uphold justice, so that the contractor system with many ills can be fundamentally eliminated."</p>
<p>Meat Merchants in the Concession: Over 1,100 fresh meat merchants in the public concession, such as Lu Gaojian, held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM on Yuezhou Road. Over 200 representatives from various shops attended. First, the chairman reported on the situation of the slaughter cessation by the industry in the Chinese area due to the slaughter tax issue. Then, discussions on assistance matters began, and it was resolved to stop importing goods from today (the 19th) and prepare to close business to show assistance.</p>
<p>Causing Panic: Due to the slaughter cessation by the fresh meat industry for the slaughter tax issue, hotels, restaurants, meal providers, noodle shops, cake stalls, and small-scale vendors in the North and South cities and the four townships cannot buy large quantities of fresh meat in the concession due to hygiene inspection and related concerns. It is said that some fresh meat shops in the concession may also join the business closure. If this is implemented, there will be no meat to buy, so they are panicking.</p>
<p>Investigation of Pig Stock: After the fresh meat industry closed business, the pig industry saw a sharp decline in sales, and imported goods were less than usual. Pig merchants wired to delay the shipment to Shanghai. According to the New Voice News Agency's investigation, pig boats usually arrive in Shanghai every day, as many as 40 boats or as few as seven or eight boats. Each large boat can carry up to 200 pigs, and small boats can carry over 100 pigs. 40 pig boats arrived on the 15th, three on the 16th, and 12 on the 17th. Few arrived yesterday, and it is expected that there will be no boats arriving in Shanghai tomorrow. There are currently over 400 pigs in stock at the Xuejiabao Changyuan and other nine pig industries, and there are about 2,000 pigs on the boats in the Huangpu River from pig merchants in various places. The Longmao, Yangjing, Fuxing, Wusong, and Wanmao pig industries in Zhabei also have only over 100 pigs. The city can sell over 2,000 pigs every day, with the concession accounting for the majority.</p>
<h3>County Slaughter Tax Replaces Recognized Merchants</h3>

<h3>Tram Mechanics Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Riri News Agency reports that the workers of the general coppersmith shop of the public concession tram company demanded the release of the arrested worker Qiao Shengfa without success, which led to a strike. The attitudes of both sides were extreme. However, after a compromise was reached the night before last, the workers secretly ordered the workers to resume work yesterday. However, due to the suddenness of the incident, some workers had not yet received the order. At 7:00 AM yesterday morning, most of the workers entered the factory, and a small number of workers did not enter the factory until after 8:00 or 9:00 AM. The damaged vehicles during the period of slowdown strike, except for a small part repaired by the factories on Hertford Road and Yangshupu, the rest were temporarily put aside. Yesterday, these vehicles were gradually sent to the general factory for repair. The work of four or five days was completed yesterday, so it was extremely busy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Cross-Border Fishing Case</h3>
<p>Dispatching Warships to Drive Away: The Zhejiang Provincial Government received a request from the Dinghai County Magistrate, stating that recently, when local fishermen in Dinghai County were sending boats out to sea to fish, a large number of Japanese fishing boats came in groups, crossing the border and infringing, forcibly fishing within our territorial waters. In addition to ordering the Outer Sea Water Police Agency to dispatch warships to the area to protect fishermen and prevent pirates, the provincial government specially requested the Shanghai Naval Headquarters to quickly dispatch several warships to the waters of Dinghai and other places to drive away Japanese fishing boats that infringe on our maritime rights and seize our fishing industry.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Struggle: There are more than 60 Japanese fishing boats in the Yellow Sea of our country, with varying loads ranging from 40 to 100 tons. Since the National Government postponed the implementation of the ban on Japanese fishing boats entering the port, the Japanese have arbitrarily fished in the Yellow Sea, mostly in Shanghai and Qingdao. However, our country has implemented the ban on Chinese merchants selling fish on behalf of Japanese boats. Therefore, the fresh fish caught by Japanese fishing boats recently and transported to Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places for sale cannot be sold by Chinese fishermen because of the ban. On the 11th of this month, Japanese fishing boats, including the Kyoei Maru, Meiri Maru, No. 7, No. 8, Linjin Maru, and No. 1 Hoshima Maru, caught a lot of fresh fish in Wusong and Haizhou and other places, loading more than 1,000 boxes. Because they could not be sold anywhere, they had to be returned to Dalian. On the one hand, the Japanese fishing boats jointly requested the Japanese consuls in Shanghai and Qingdao to negotiate with our country to request a postponement of the ban on selling fresh fish from Japanese boats on their behalf. It is currently in progress.</p>

<h3>Statement by Judge Gong Cheng of the French Court</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, when Judge Gong Xiangsheng of the French Court was sitting in the Civil Court to hear minor civil cases, he said to the lawyers present in court, "This judge read in the newspaper today that the Lawyers Association sent a telegram to National Government Chairman Chiang, the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the case of recovering the Mixed Court, containing words that damage the reputation of this judge. This judge has always expressed sympathy for the recovery of this court. However, since taking office, he has handled all Chinese and foreign cases impartially, and the cases he has judged have all been handled according to law and have always been open. If you lawyers have any accusations, you must have concrete evidence and cannot speak without thinking. Regarding the issuance of arrest warrants, they have always been signed by the Chinese judge and have never been signed by the French consul alone. Today, for the sake of solemnity, in addition to making a statement first, I will also send a letter to your Lawyers Association for proper correction."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Coal Market Already Controlled by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Coal Prices Increasing Daily</p>
<p>Chartered Steamers Compete to Transport Coal to Shanghai</p>
<p>Shanghai is a vital transportation hub where various railways converge, with an immense daily demand for fuel coal. Before the suspension of operations, Kailuan coal had the largest share of the market. Since the disruption on the Beining Railway, which prevented Kailuan coal from reaching Shanghai, Japanese coal has swiftly taken the lead in the Shanghai coal market.  The surge in imports, rise in coal prices, the rapid escalation, and the current immense influence are truly astonishing.  The recent situation is detailed below:</p>
<p>Rapid Increase in Japanese Coal  The variety of Japanese coal sold in the Shanghai market is extensive. Popular types include Mitsui, Sakito, Wakamatsu Kazuishi, and Fushun. The most popular of these are Fushun and Mitsui, followed by Sakito. The major distributors in Shanghai are Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Okabe, among others. Since the suspension of Kailuan coal shipments, Japanese coal has met the demands of the market and various factories and steamships, almost to the point of being unable to meet supply.  It has thus leapt to the forefront of the Shanghai fuel coal market.  In April of last year, Kailuan coal sales in Shanghai amounted to approximately 120,000 tons, while Fushun coal sales were around 40,000 tons, accounting for one-third.  In April of this year, the situation has drastically changed.  Due to excessive demand, Fushun coal sales have increased by 81,000 tons compared to the same month last year, making it the leader in coal sales.</p>
<p>British Steamships Switch to Japanese Coal  British trading firms in Shanghai, such as Butterfield &amp; Swire (Taikoo) and Jardine Matheson, possess the largest number of steamships and also consume the most coal. Since the suspension of Kailuan coal shipments to Shanghai, British steamships have switched to using Japanese coal to compensate. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and other river and ocean steamships have now entered into contracts with Mitsui &amp; Co. to switch to using Mitsui coal. Mitsui coal comes from Mitsui's own coal mines. Taking advantage of the Kailuan disruption, it has secured a huge, long-term customer in the form of British steamships in Shanghai.  The company is arranging large-scale shipments.</p>
<p>Chartering Ships for Transportation  Over the past two months, businesses in Shanghai dealing in Japanese coal have experienced a surge in business, with daily increases in coal shipments.  In addition to their own twenty coal-carrying ships, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and others have chartered over ten ships from the Dalian Steamship Company to transport coal to Shanghai.  They still find that there is too much coal and not enough ships. Mitsui and Dalian Steamship have chartered eight British ships in Shanghai to assist in transporting coal.  Furthermore, they have commissioned companies such as R.M. Lambert &amp; Co. to charter over a dozen Chinese merchant ships, including the "Hua Wu" and "Wu Yang," to compete in transporting Japanese coal from Fushun, Mitsui, and Sakito.  Due to the high demand and abundant supply, the market price of Japanese coal has gradually increased.  The price of Fushun coal has risen several times. Today, the Shanghai coal market is controlled by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Sugar Industry Guild</h3>
<p>Regarding the China International Sugar Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Guild, noting that Shanghai newspapers have carried advertisements for the China International Sugar Company soliciting distributors for Cuban sugar, yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industries requesting a thorough investigation and prohibition. It also sent a letter to the China International Sugar Company requesting a detailed response regarding their distribution methods. The telegram and letter are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Industries  To His Excellency Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industries: This guild has received numerous reports from its members that a Spanish man named Peralta (translated as Po Lai Da) has established the China International Sugar Company on Guangdong Road in Shanghai, claiming to represent the Cuban government and to have signed an agreement with your Ministry to invest US$55.5 million in China to establish sugar factories. Due to a lack of cash, he intends to sell Cuban sugar in China, using the proceeds as the investment capital. He claims that the import of this Cuban sugar has been approved by the Chinese government and is entitled to duty-free import. He also claims that this sugar will soon arrive in China and that to promote sales, it will be priced 25% to 20% lower than Javanese and Japanese sugar. He has also advertised widely for distributors and managers. Sugar is a foodstuff and a necessity for the people's livelihood. In the past, domestic sugar production was substantial, but in recent years it has declined significantly, almost to zero. The reasons for this are twofold: first, domestic manufacturers adhere to outdated methods without making improvements; second, heavy taxes and high costs have allowed foreign sugar to flood the market, with annual imports amounting to over 100 million yuan. Meanwhile, domestic sugar production is languishing, gradually declining. The late President Sun Yat-sen, with his foresight, repeatedly emphasized suppressing foreign goods and revitalizing domestic industries as the key to self-strengthening. Your Excellency, upholding the late President's teachings, is actively promoting domestic industries and sparing no effort. This year's implementation of tax cuts and increased surcharges is intended to revitalize domestic goods. We had hoped that domestic sugar would recover from its decline and that the huge financial drain could be reversed. We were all celebrating and filled with excitement. But unexpectedly, a sudden announcement has been made about the arrival of a large quantity of Cuban sugar in China, which is tantamount to self-destruction, as it will drive domestic sugar into an irreversible state of ruin. Furthermore, we have learned that sugar merchants in our country have been suffering losses due to the impact of high gold and low silver prices. Maintaining the status quo has become extremely difficult. If this large quantity of Cuban sugar is sold at a particularly low price, even if it is only 20% lower, it would still be more than two taels lower than the market price. Shanghai alone has over a million bags of sugar in stock, weighing 1.6 to 1.7 million piculs. The price of this stored sugar would inevitably plummet, resulting in a loss of over 3 million taels in Shanghai alone, not to mention the losses in other ports. The sugar merchants, already deeply wounded, would be unable to withstand this. Few would survive. Therefore, the import of this Cuban sugar would harm merchants and the nation to the utmost. We believe that Your Excellency, who cares for industry and commerce, would not allow this to happen. However, the rumors are persistent, and there must be some basis for them. We, the public, are alarmed, and a sense of impending doom has arisen. The guild is confused and does not know what to do. Therefore, we send this urgent telegram, hoping that Your Excellency will investigate and grant us relief to preserve the last hope for domestic sugar and to sustain the sugar merchants' hard-won businesses. If it is indeed a complete fabrication by this Westerner to deceive and mislead, we hope that Your Excellency will promptly investigate and prohibit it to prevent confusion and ensure the stability of the sugar industry. This is an urgent plea, and we await your instructions. Respectfully, the Shanghai Sugar Industry Guild.</p>
<p>Letter to the China International Sugar Company: We write to you regarding the advertisements placed by your company in the Shanghai newspapers soliciting distributors for Cuban sugar. We extend our congratulations on your new initiative. As your company is also engaged in the sugar trade, it has a close relationship with our guild. We look forward to learning more about your organization, its capital (whether sole proprietorship or joint venture, limited or unlimited liability), the names and nationalities of its shareholders, whether it has been registered, its business objectives, distribution procedures, and when the sugar will arrive. We hope to receive a detailed response within three days of receiving this letter so that we can discuss the matter further. We eagerly await your reply.</p>
<h3>Conciliation Committee Elected Yesterday by Real Estate Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association previously resolved to establish a Conciliation Committee to mediate disputes between landlords and tenants in order to prevent mutual losses.  It was decided to elect seven committee members through mail-in voting.  The ballots were counted yesterday at 5:00 PM, with over twenty people in attendance.  Kui Yanfang was publicly elected as chairman. After the designated vote counters and readers tallied the votes, the ballots were opened in public.  A total of thirty-eight ballots were cast, resulting in the following results: Kui Yanfang received 35 votes, Dou Yaoting received 29 votes, Jiang Bingsheng received 19 votes, Ye Shantao received 17 votes, Liu Hongyuan received 16 votes, Yuan Ludeng received 15 votes, and Zhang Xingcun received 13 votes. They were elected as members of the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<h3>Labor Problems Research Association Established</h3>
<p>The Labor Department of the Shanghai YMCA recently organized the "Shanghai Universities Student Labor Problems Research Association" to meet the needs of university students by enabling them to understand the living conditions of workers, investigate the actual situation of laborers, and study labor problems.  The first expanded research meeting was held on April 18th. The number of attendees was very enthusiastic, and the discussion was very satisfactory.  Representatives from seven schools, including Great China, Chung Kung, Guanghua, Fudan, Labor University, Soochow, and St. John's, were elected on the spot to form a preparatory committee to plan all relevant matters.  The articles of association have now been drafted and will be formally announced soon. All students from Shanghai universities who are interested in studying labor problems are welcome to register and participate.</p>
<h3>Yu Hua Wage Dispute Resolved Through Mediation</h3>
<p>The wage dispute at the Yu Hua Silk Weaving Factory on Tangshan Road in Hongkou, which led to a joint strike by workers from three factories, was resolved after the authorities intervened and the workers gradually returned to work while awaiting a resolution.  The Social Affairs Bureau mediated several times without success. Yesterday at 9:00 AM, the bureau held a final mediation session. Representatives from the management, Li Zhongxuan, and from the workers, Wei Shouchang and Yu Ande, attended, with Wang Bing of the Social Affairs Bureau presiding. After lengthy discussions, a settlement was reached with the following terms: (1) Wages will be calculated at three cents per foot as determined by the factory. (2) The factory shall not change the interweaved fabrics to pure silk fabrics within this year. (3) Wages for the silk reeling department will be 36 cents per package for 60-count cotton yarn and 30 cents per package for 120-count rayon. (4) If the factory has a surplus at the end of the year, bonuses will be paid according to the practice of the former Jinhua Factory, based on merit.</p>
<h3>Citywide Silk Factory Wage Dispute</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Intervenes, Aims for Resolution</p>
<p>Over 61,000 male and female silk reeling workers in the city have demanded the restoration of their original wages. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau summoned representatives for questioning on the afternoon of the 16th to facilitate mediation. Attending were Yue Xiaorong and Chen Xiupu, representatives of the Fourth District Silk Reeling Workers Union; Yuan Yunlong and Yang Gengdi, representatives of the Sixth District Silk Reeling Workers; and Tao Huachen, representative of the Silk Factories Guild. Guo Yongxi, a staff member of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided, with Wang Zhixin recording. The Fourth District Union representatives stated that, at the representatives' congress on March 13, workers had requested that management restore original wage levels. In the Sixth District, there had been a strike due to wage issues in April. Now, the union, based on the workers' request, argues that silk prices increased in February and March and therefore, they demand restoration of original wages starting from May. The management stated that, based on a market price of US$1.88 per pound and an exchange rate of US$31.50 per US$100 Chinese silver, one dan can only be sold for approximately US$240, equivalent to 720 taels of silver. Silk prices have not increased compared to when the agreement was signed last year, so they cannot restore wages. After lengthy discussions, the workers, in consideration of the factories' business operations, proposed temporarily suspending their original request. However, they demanded that the wages be restored according to the agreement starting from June 1st, regardless of the situation. Afterwards, the chairman announced the end of the questioning.</p>
<h3>Two Railways Purchase Cars from England</h3>
<p>Delivery Expected in Autumn</p>
<p>Luo Panhui, Director of the Two Railways Bureau, recognizing the shortage of cars on the two railways, which made business development difficult, specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways for approval to order dozens of the latest model cars and sleeping cars of various types from the British United Carriage Company. Delivery is expected in the autumn of this year. The funds will be allocated from the refund of the Boxer Indemnity.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Dock Dues Collected by Cotton Cloth and Customs Declaration Businesses</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Replies to Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The dispute over dock dues collected by cotton cloth and customs declaration businesses has not yet been resolved. As a result, some cotton cloth cargo shipments from this factory are still effectively suspended. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to investigate the responsibility in terms of business operations and resolve the matter properly. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce replied, saying, "In response to your order to investigate and reply regarding the reasons for the responsibility for collecting and paying dock dues, for your review and approval: This Chamber received your Bureau's order No. 9671 on the 2nd of this month, which stated that the dispute between workers of the Customs Declaration Guild and the Cotton Cloth Guild has been resolved. However, the Bureau ordered that we investigate and properly resolve who should collect and pay the dock dues based on business operations, and submit a reply detailing the handling of the matter for reference. We have dispatched personnel to investigate and offer the following points for your consideration: (1) The cotton cloth business only exchanges goods for money and does not have a definite responsibility to pay dues on behalf of customers. (2) The customs declaration business handles customs declarations on behalf of customers, but whether it is willing to accept the responsibility of paying dues on behalf of customers is also entirely voluntary. (3) The responsibility for paying dock dues, based on the above two points, seems to lie with the customer assistants of the cargo owner. Therefore, to resolve this issue, the customer assistants must first express their responsibility. Otherwise, neither business is responsible, and even if mediation is desired, it would be impossible to proceed. We offer these humble opinions based on our investigation and submit this document for your review and approval, as it would be in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Measures for Shops Accepting Deposits</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Modified Method</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received an order to handle the case of prohibiting ordinary companies and shops from concurrently operating savings businesses. The Bureau drafted five measures and submitted them to the Municipal Government, which forwarded them to the Ministry of Finance for review and instructions. Details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is said that the Ministry of Finance originally intended to include the acceptance of deposits by ordinary shops in the prohibition. However, the Bureau believes that very few ordinary shops operate without using their own capital and accepting deposits. A sudden prohibition would have a significant impact on the future of commerce. It proposed to slightly restrict the practice within the bounds of commercial custom. Ordinary shops that do not use the name of savings and follow these measures would be exempt from the prohibition. This was submitted to the Municipal Government and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for review and reply. The following are two of the modified methods regarding prohibiting shops from accepting deposits: (1) Shops shall not advertise for deposits in newspapers. (2) Shops shall not accept deposits from anyone other than relatives and friends based on mutual trust.</p>
<h3>Shop Assistants and Teahouse Staff Not Considered Shop Employees</h3>
<p>Interpretation by the Supreme Court</p>
<p>Regarding whether shop apprentices, errand boys, and teahouse staff in hotels, teahouses, and bathhouses should join the trade guild as shop workers or join the labor union as vocational workers, the Supreme Court has interpreted that "Article 8 of the Implementation Rules for Trade Guilds of Industry and Commerce promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on January 7, 1930, refers to 'employees.' This was amended and renamed 'shop employees' by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on January 27, 1931 (Article 10 of the amended rules). 'Shop employees' refers to personnel directly serving in the business operations of the shop. Referring to Article 9 of the amended Implementation Rules for Chambers of Commerce, errand boys and teahouse staff of shops are not considered shop employees. As for shop apprentices, they should be categorized based on whether they directly serve in the business operations."</p>
<h3>Leprosy Lecture at the YMCA</h3>
<p>Dr. Weeder, a world-renowned leprosy expert, gave a lecture at the YMCA yesterday. Although it was raining heavily, the audience was still very enthusiastic, totaling over 600 people. First, Mr. Wu Zhijian, General Secretary of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, gave an introductory speech. Then, Dr. Weeder spoke about the situation at the Culion Leprosarium in the Philippines, translated by Mr. Gao Mingqiang. The main points were that Culion is one of the three islands of Palawan, covering 140 square miles, and is located near many leprosy patients, making it very suitable for establishing a leprosarium. However, there was no treatment in the past, so lepers rarely returned after being exiled. In the past twenty years, more attention has been paid to treatment, and all kinds of facilities have been provided, such as telegraph offices, schools, power plants, police stations, department stores, and prisons, making Culion almost an independent society. Another thing worth mentioning is that in Cebu, the second largest city in the Philippines, there is a leprosy clinic specifically for mild cases to seek treatment. The annual cost is very low, but the results are very significant. This shows that leprosy relief does not require a large amount of funding. Afterwards, a film showing life at the Culion Leprosarium was screened, which was praised by the audience.</p>
<h3>Woman with Bound Feet Injured by Tram</h3>
<p>Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, a trolleybus No. 164 on Route 18, while arriving at the Beinicheng Bridge station, had a passenger Sun Ruiting overzealously ring the bell before other passengers could disembark. The driver, Wang Zhenhai, upon hearing the bell, started the trolley. As the ticket seller Peng Puyayu realized this and rung the bell to stop the trolley, a woman with bound feet by the name of Zhu Wang Shi, 47 years of age and hailing from Haiyan, was getting off the trolley and had her left foot crushed under the left wheel. She fell and was unable to get up. The police investigated the cause of the accident and arrested Sun and sent the injured woman to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, the injuries were severe, and she died two hours later. The body was taken to the Forensic Center on Feilun Road by the police car for examination. The next morning, the Special District Court was notified, and Prosecutor Guo was commissioned to conduct an examination at the scene. He instructed the woman's son, Zhu Baoquan, to claim the body for burial. Sun Ruiting is suspected of committing a crime and was taken back to the police station to await trial by the court.</p>
<h3>Three-Year Runaway Wife Met on a Narrow Road</h3>
<p>Wife Escapes with Wit and Words</p>
<p>Husband Refuses to Give Up and Finally Finds Her</p>
<p>Zhang Guifang, a 20-year-old from Huai'an, was betrothed to Wang Jiaxiao, also from the same village, by his parents at a young age. She was immediately taken into his home as a child bride. Not long after, Zhang's father passed away. Because Zhang was young and unable to support himself, he was raised by his uncle, Zhang Jinsheng. Later, due to a famine in their hometown, his uncle brought Zhang and his wife Jiaxiao to Shanghai to learn a trade and make a living. They rented a house at No. 5 Yuncheng Lane, Meixie Road, outside Xiaoximen in Nanshi. By 1928, Jiaxiao had grown into a 19-year-old woman. Zhang's uncle, Jinsheng, sent her to work in a sock factory. Unexpectedly, in June of that year, Jiaxiao seized the opportunity when the family was unprepared and ran away without a trace. Zhang and his uncle searched everywhere, but to no avail. Three years passed, and Zhang had almost forgotten about it. Unexpectedly, they ran into each other on a narrow road near Haichao Temple Street in Xiaonanmen the other day. He immediately forced her to return home. Jiaxiao suddenly claimed that since she ran away, it has been several years. She is now living with her lover, Liu Yuqing, and Liu treats her very badly. Therefore, she deeply regrets it. Even if they had not come looking for her, she had been thinking of returning. However, if she returns with them now, her lover, Liu Yuqing, would feel that he got off too easy. It would be better to wait a while longer, until Liu goes out, and then take all of Liu's belongings and reunite. This should not be late. But this must be kept a secret. Once it is revealed, things will be difficult. Guifang, hearing that his wife had such a passionate heart, deeply believed her. He bid her farewell and they went their separate ways. From then on, Guifang returned home to await good news, hoping for a reunion. Unexpectedly, day after day passed, and not only was there no sign of Jiaxiao, but there was also no news. Only then did he realize that he had been fooled. He started actively investigating again and learned that after his wife had escaped, she and her lover had moved to near the Shanghai Garrison. After finding out the address, he went with his uncle, Jinsheng, to the address around 9:00 PM the other night. They found Jiaxiao, as well as her lover, Liu Yuqing, and brought them both to the Third Sub-station of the First District. After a preliminary interrogation by Director Jin, Liu Yuqing confessed that he was 25 years old, from Hubei, and engaged in the pig slaughtering business. He has known Jiaxiao for many years. They initially lived together in their hometown. Because he was not used to village life, he came to Shanghai for the second time last October. He was recently found by her fiancé. Wang Jiaxiao confessed that she was 22 years old and Guifang was indeed her fiancé. However, his uncle, Jinsheng, was by nature violent. If she disobeyed him, she would be beaten. Therefore, she could not stand the abuse. She then met Liu and ran away to Hubei together. She came to Shanghai last year and has had four children with Liu, two of whom have died. One child is three years old, and she is currently four months pregnant. Director Jin, based on the confessions, immediately drafted a document and sent it to the Shanghai District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Holds General Meeting Yesterday</h3>

They also re-elected twenty-one executive committee members and five supervisory committee members before adjourning the meeting.</p>

<h3>Bao Fangzhou Arrested</h3>
<p>Shanxi Party Department Alleges Bao is a Communist</p>
<p>Claiming He is Actually an Alias of Dong Muchao</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau's Request for Extradition Denied</p>
<p>Result: Released on Bail with a Reputable Shop as Guarantor</p>
<p>The China Mental Research Institute on Bazilu Road, Hongkou, was founded by Bao Fangzhou, a meat sleep scholar. Bao is from Guangdong and studied in Japan in the early years of the Republic of China, specializing in mental science, and has gained considerable experience. He returned to Shanghai after completing his studies in the 7th year of the Republic of China and began to treat people with hypnotism, which was quite effective. He then founded this association. For more than ten years, he has written extensively on mental science, and those who admire his academic ability in the country have established a correspondence department, and they are willing to be listed in the ranks so that it can be widely spread. Therefore, the number of members who have registered to join the Association is increasing day by day, and Bao does not distinguish between gender, so there are many female disciples in particular, such as Ms. Liu Chunyi of Shaanxi, who was elected chairman of the National Assembly held in the capital this time, is also a member, such as Zhang, the vice commander's younger brother Zhang Xueming, the mayor of Tianjin, and the grandson of the late Qing Dynasty State Minister Li, Li Mugong, etc.</p>
<p>All have successively held gifts to ask for advice and Bao's name has become more obvious. Gu This kind of hypnotism, although extremely effective, can only be used for medical treatment, and it is forbidden by all countries in the world to apply it to criminals and interrogate them for confessions. The confessions obtained are after the criminals have lost consciousness, and the criminals are not willing to admit it. It is reported that last year, the highest military authority in this city interrogated a Communist Party member, and the person was unusually cunning. He was repeatedly interrogated and failed to obtain a confession. Bao was once summoned to</p>
<p>Apply the technique to the bandits and get all the secrets, but after the case was finalized, it is not known whether this confession was used as the standard. However, Bao Si always used this matter to flaunt the spirit of his technique, saying that he was deeply praised by the authorities at that time and was happy. Unexpectedly, Bao was suddenly arrested the other day, and his crime was "suspicion of announcing communism," which the world hates. The arrester was the Public Security Bureau of this city. It is said that the Qing Party Committee of the Shanxi Provincial Party Department recently sent a letter stating that Bao Fangzhou, a Cantonese who founded the Mental Research Institute at 176 Bazilu Road, is actually</p>
<p>The alias of the Communist Party member Dong Muchao is using the name of research to promote communism. He should be arrested nearby to curb the chaos. Director Chen Xizeng believed that since the Party Department had reported the accusation, both the false and the real should be thoroughly investigated. Because the address belonged to the Public Concession, Detective Cao Chengqing was sent to Hongkou Police Station the other day to request assistance in the detention. After the head detective obtained a detention warrant from the Special Zone Local Court, he sent Chinese and Western detectives to the address to arrest Bao and immediately searched in detail, only finding the mental</p>
<p>Research Institute membership list, without any books or items involving communism, was sent to the Special Court yesterday morning, and Judge Feng Shide opened the third court for investigation. The Municipal Public Security Bureau did not send a representative to the case, and the Municipal Council was represented by lawyer Li Zhishan, who opposed the extradition of Bao. According to lawyer Li, the police station found that the defendant had been practicing medicine in the concession in the name of Bao Fangzhou for thirteen years, and there was no other name Dong Muchao. The letter from the Shanxi Party Department is difficult to believe. If the Municipal Public Security Bureau wants to request the extradition of the defendant based solely on the letter, then it should</p>
<p>Provide sufficient evidence to prove the facts of the crime, and the police station can agree. The membership list was then submitted to the court. Judge Feng then questioned the defendant, who confessed that his name was Bao Fangzhou, a Cantonese, 38 years old, and his name was not Dong Muchao. There was no Dong Muchao among all the members, which could be carefully examined in the list. He also explained in detail the process of studying hypnotism in Japan and establishing a mental research institute in Shanghai, and that he was summoned by the military authorities of this port last year to test hypnotism.</p>
<p>Asked the bandits for confessions. In detail, he said that he had been in Shanghai for many years, and he was not good at socializing. He had very few friends, and he had never interfered in national affairs. He also asked his lawyer to submit all his works over the years, one by one, requesting them to be checked, so that the defendant's ambition could be judged and he could be released. After consideration, Judge Feng ordered Bao to be released on bail with a reputable shop as guarantor, and waited for the Municipal Public Security Bureau to submit evidence before conducting a further inquiry. It is difficult to predict whether Bao will be extradited or not.</p>
<h3>Mad Cow from the Fence</h3>
<p>Galloping for Miles, Injuring People and Destroying Property</p>
<p>Western Police Bravely Shot and Killed with Eight Shots</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a water buffalo suddenly went mad at Fei Xingfa's cattle slaughterhouse at 410 Beijing-Jiang Road, jumped over the wall and escaped, rushing around along the way, injuring many people. It then escaped to the vicinity of Gordon Road in the Public Concession, where it was shot eight times in a row by Western police before falling to the ground dying. The matter was quite interesting, so the beginning and end are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Roaring and Leaping Out On the morning of yesterday, at about 8:00, Fei Xingfa's cattle slaughterhouse was slaughtering three heads of yellow cattle and one head of water buffalo for customers. Because it was still early, the four cattle were locked in a bamboo fence, ready to be pulled out for slaughter in time. However, at about 10:30, a water buffalo suddenly roared several times, jumped out of the fence, jumped over the wall, and ran wildly in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>Injuring People and Destroying Property The workers in the shop saw the cow jumping over the wall and escaping. Because the water buffalo was strong, they were afraid of causing trouble, so they chased out to capture it, but the cow was like a madman, flying and jumping wildly, hitting with its horns, invincible, and no one dared to resist. The houses in the area of ​​Taiyang Temple Road are all simple, low bungalows. All those who were visited by the cow injured people and destroyed property. Lu Qinghuai, a 12-year-old boy at 16 Longfu Li, Taiyang Temple Road, was the most severely injured. His head was smashed by the cow's horns, and his waist was trampled. Li Zhaodi, an 18-year-old girl on Jingjiang Road, was injured in the legs and arms. Tang Naixing, a straw shed at 49 Taiyang Temple Road, was knocked to the ground, his clothes were torn and bleeding. In particular, the belongings of Xia Dehong's house at 10 Yidexili on the same road were all destroyed, causing considerable losses. (The above-mentioned people have all reported to the Fourth District General Administration). The others who were slightly injured and had furniture damaged are not counted.</p>
<p>Eight Shots to Death Yang Jintang, the chief of the Taiyang Temple Police Station in the Fourth District, learned of this and led the police to pursue it, but the cow was not afraid at all and was as if it were in an uninhabited place. The police officers could do nothing and watched it cross the railway, turn west into Gonghe Road via Datong Road, take Hengfeng Road, cross the Sampan Factory New Bridge, and arrive at Carter Road. At that time, a police officer from the police station saw a water buffalo rushing in like a tide and knew it was a mad cow. He tried to stop it with his hands, but was hit by the cow and fell several feet away, covered in mud. The Western police immediately jumped up and fired eight shots in a row. The cow could no longer support itself and fell to the ground at the intersection of Carter Road and Gordon Road. It was then sent to Longfei Car Company by car. According to the report, the cow ran from Jingjiang Road to Gordon Road, a distance of several miles, crashing into objects, and no one dared to resist it. It was indeed strange that it only fell to the ground and died after being shot eight times.</p>
<h3>Pirates Rampant, Kidnapping Two Ship Owners</h3>
<p>Extorting 5,000 Yuan Each</p>
<p>To be Redeemed at Dahong Port, North of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Salt City gang sand ships Lü Changrong, Wang Fashun, etc., loaded with cuttlefish to Song for sale, because of the registration turmoil with the Public Works Bureau Ship Affairs Department, it was delayed for two days. It was not until the other day that the fish was sold out. Each ship agreed to open up and planned to return to the North Ocean to catch the second tide. At about 8:00 on the morning of the former day, eight fish ships of Lü Changrong and others began to sail to Pao Taiwan. Because the wind was not favorable, they stopped and anchored. When the tide came in the evening, they sailed to the Duck Nest Sandy Sea outside the port and suddenly encountered two pirate ships. More than 20 pirates surrounded the fish ships Lü Changlong and Chen Fashun and ordered them to stop. There were five pirates each with a northern accent, each holding a pistol, who jumped on the fish ship with great momentum, and warned them not to make any noise. They locked the crew in a cabin and searched separately. Because there was no silver dollar in the ship, they got nothing, which aroused the anger of the pirates, so they kidnapped the shipowner of Lü Changlong, Lü Taihua, and the shipowner of Chen Fashun, Chen Changfu. Before leaving, they claimed that each person must prepare 5,000 yuan to redeem the tickets at Dahong Port, North of the Yangtze River, otherwise they would be killed. After the pirates left, the two ships returned to Wusong and reported to Baofeng and Cuisheng fish firms, that is, the two firms sent Sun Shaoce (Cuisheng) and Su Zhichun (Baofeng) with the crew to the Fourth District of the Water Police to report the encounter with the pirates and requested the arrest of the pirates and the rescue of the two kidnapped month masters from danger. They also sent warships to protect the export of fish boats and catch the second general purpose. When the two ships were robbed, the other six fish ships of Wang Fashun and others heard the alarm and fled back to Songkou, all daring not to sail. According to the crew of the robbed fish boat, when the pirates were searching, they asked the crew what kind of ships they were. When they answered that they were from the Salt City gang, the pirates asked if they knew Yu Ruoshui in Yancheng. The crew was dumbfounded and could not answer, and the pirates left. Later, according to other boatmen, Yu is a famous pirate leader. The pirates inquired about him, and it is not known what they intended. After receiving the report, the fourth district of the Wusong Water Provincial Public Security Team has ordered the provincial water police Junhe cruiser stationed at the mouth of the Wenzaobang in the Pudong River to quickly sail out of Songkou and track down and suppress the pirates in various oceans.</p>
<h3>International Children's Day</h3>

<p>The Shanghai International Children's Festival held by 22 countries including China, Britain, Japan, France, the United States, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Belgium, broadcast a declaration of International Children's Friendship Day at the Sassoon Building broadcasting station on the Bund at 10:00 AM yesterday, as it was Children's Memorial Day, and broadcast it at the Chinese Broadcasting Corporation Radio Station on Avenue Edward VII at 5:00 PM.

<h3>The Thief Who Throws Bags is Terrible</h3>
<p>Do Not Pick Up Anything Left on the Roadside</p>
<p>Otherwise, There Will Be Unexpected Disputes</p>
<p>The methods used by bandits to solicit fraud are different and must be applied according to the person and the location. It is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The bag throwing technique is also a type of solicitation fraud. This technique was very old and seems to be outdated in modern times, but there are still people who are fooled by it, so I will describe the inside story to warn those who are greedy for small profits. When we are walking, if we see one or two yuan or several silver coins abandoned on a remote road, we should not pick them up greedily. Otherwise, someone will suddenly come out to intervene and point out that what we picked up was lost by them. If we do not return it, these people will use this as an excuse to forcibly search and rob us until we have nothing left. There are many such bag throwing bandits in the Hongkou area. The Hongkou police station has successively arrested ten people, including Liu A'san and Yao Bigui, in recent days, and seized four wallets, all of which were used to steal from passers-by using this technique. However, the money in the wallets has been used up. Because the police station needs to investigate the owner, Judge Xiao of the Special Zone Local Court briefly questioned the bandits yesterday and ordered them to be returned to prison for further investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3>How Many Jumped into the River</h3>
<p>Fortunately, All Were Rescued</p>
<p>A Bowl of Cold Porridge Sparks a Tempest</p>
<p>On the Qinghe Ferry, which travels across the river from the Lan Road Wharf in eastern Shanghai, around 6 PM the night before last, a middle-aged woman suddenly threw herself into the river not far after the ferry departed from the wharf. The ferry captain, Zhang Zhongbing, noticed this and immediately stopped the boat, managing to rescue her. Thankfully, she was saved. She was then sent to the Weituo Wharf Water Police Station. According to the police chief's interrogation, she was a Ms. Zhang Yang, 36 years old, from Funing, Shandong, residing east of the shoe factory on Yangzhou Road. Her husband is named Zhang Beisu, and she has a 17-year-old son named Genkui, who is currently learning a trade elsewhere. She works as a female worker, number 501, at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill in eastern Shanghai. She stated that at noon today, she saw a bowl of cold porridge that had been left out for several days and smelled bad, so she poured it out. Her husband found out and claimed that times were difficult, and that cold porridge should not be taken lightly, and started to scold her loudly. She scolded back, and her husband raised his hand and beat her fiercely. Neighbors intervened and stopped the fight. Furthermore, her work schedule at the factory happened to be the night shift this week, so she went to bed after eating, waking up at 5 PM to prepare for the night shift. However, her husband continued to make sarcastic remarks, which she could no longer endure. She was consumed with anger and felt that she could no longer tolerate living in such a state, so she decided to seek death. The police chief then sent a detective to bring her husband, Zhang Beisu, to the police station. He confessed that he would not dare to abuse her again and would accept any punishment if he violated this promise. The police chief ordered him to write a statement and take his wife home, treating her kindly.</p>
<p>Unemployment is Dreadful, Youth Despairs of Life</p>
<p>Chen Guozhen, from Suzhou, is 23 years old and resides in Zhabei, Shanghai. He lives with his mother, Ms. Jin. Chen has been unemployed for five years, spending his days at home, sighing in frustration. He has been seeking a suitable position to earn a living, but without success. With the high cost of everything and the high cost of living, making ends meet is difficult. However, Chen continued to strive and fight against his circumstances, hoping to find a way out, but to no avail. Eventually, he became bored and despaired of life. The day before yesterday, around 10 AM, he left home alone, carrying his mother on his back, and went to the Xinguang Wharf. He hired sampan number 1228, stating that he wanted to go to Pudong. When the boat reached the center of the river, he took the opportunity to jump into the river and commit suicide. The boatman, Xin Wenfu, quickly used a bamboo pole to hook him, preventing him from drowning. He was then sent to the Lujiazui Water Police Station. After questioning, Chen revealed the whole story, also stating that the owner of the Zhou Maochang ivory shop in the Xinbei Men area was his friend. The police station immediately sent detective Wu Rongsheng to investigate. That evening, his mother, Ms. Jin, accompanied by a friend, went to the police station to take Chen home.</p>
<p>Gambling is Harmful, Almost Costing a Life</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, around 1 AM, a young man at the Hongkou Nisshin Company Wharf hired sampan number 955 alone, saying he wanted to go to Pudong. When the boat reached the center of the river, he immediately paid the fare of two dimes. In a blink of an eye, he suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the boatman, Yuan Qingting, used a bamboo pole to hook his clothes and rescue him, thus saving his life. Yuan then took him to the Lujiazui Water Police Station for questioning. According to the police chief's interrogation, his name is Chen Jinhe, 24 years old, from Chaozhou. He admitted that he is addicted to gambling and gambles every day. Unfortunately, his luck was bad, and he lost over 200 yuan in just a few days last year. He secretly took the money from the shop, which was discovered by the manager, and he was fired. Since then, he has not found a suitable job. Now, he has run out of money and is struggling to make ends meet. He feels that his future is bleak and hopeless, so he jumped into the river to end his miserable life. The police chief ordered detective Huang Songsheng to investigate and learned that Chen was familiar with the Wanfeng pawnshop on Cais Market Street in the French Concession. He went to the shop to inform them. At 3 AM, his friends Li Jiafen and Liu A'gen went to the police station to take responsibility and escort Chen back, promising to find a way to help him.</p>
<h3>News of the Engineering Society Tour</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Engineering Society is scheduled to visit factories, universities, radio stations, and other places in the Zhenru and Wusong area on May 24th (Sunday). The society has already notified its members by letter. In addition to the visits, various games such as kite flying, shuttlecock kicking, hide-and-seek, tennis, ring toss, egg-and-spoon race, and other interesting activities will be held on the beach at Paotaiwan. All attending members and guests are welcome to participate, and prizes will be awarded to add to the fun. The transportation for the tour will be special tour buses chartered from the Gongji Automobile Company in Zhabei. These buses are new and are quite similar to the Pudong public buses operated by the Shanghai Municipality previously, so they are very comfortable. It was not easy for the society to rent them. The all-inclusive cost for the day, including transportation and meals, is approximately two yuan per person. It is expected to be a lively event. To facilitate its members, the branch has announced that those who wish to participate can contact the general office or Mr. Zhu Qiqing at the Wireless Radio General Station at 565 Minquan Road, Mr. Wang Luxin at the Xintong Company at 92 Jiujiang Road, or Mr. Zheng Baocheng at the Municipal Public Works Bureau on Fenglin Road. If it rains on the scheduled day, the event will be postponed by one week. Members will be notified separately regarding the confirmation of the postponement.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of the Man Assassinated on Rue Chapsal</h3>
<p>At around 2:30 AM the day before yesterday, the body of Tianzi, who was assassinated and shot in the philtrum, was found in front of number 42 Rue Chapsal in the French Concession. After investigation by the Western police, the case was reported to the police station. Detectives were dispatched to move the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination. A bill from the Southeast New Hotel was found on the body, bearing the name "Wang Caifa, Ningbo native" and a description of his clothing. This was noted in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the body has been identified as Wang Caifa. However, no relatives have been found. Yesterday, the Criminal Division of the French Police Station reported the case to Judge Zhu of the French Court, who ordered an autopsy. He ordered that photographs be taken and that the court provide a coffin for burial and storage, pending identification by relatives. The police station was instructed to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Man Crushed to Death by Train</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10 o'clock, a train from Shanghai to Nanjing crushed a man to death while passing through Jiaotong Road in Zhabei. The man, approximately 45 or 46 years old, sustained injuries to his head. He was wearing a black serge mandarin jacket, a dark blue old cloth padded jacket, a blue cloth short shirt, and blue cloth trousers with a cloth apron, white socks, and black shoes. He was carrying an umbrella. The local constable reported the incident, and the railway police took custody of the body.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Yangtze River basin and the coastal areas would be cloudy with rain or fog. There would be northeasterly winds over the East China Sea, and winds from the north to northwest along the Shandong coast. The weather south of Japan is severe due to a hurricane east of Luzon that is turning northeast and heading north or northeast. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 60.7 degrees, and the lowest was 55.7 degrees. At the same time last year, the highest was 91.4 degrees, and the lowest was 68.0 degrees.</p>

<h3>The Bank of China's 1930 Business Report (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Decline of the World Market</p>
<p>In 1930, the global economic situation was extremely depressed. Except for France and the Netherlands, almost all governments and people were struggling with economic depression. The most obvious phenomena were: (1) Decline in trade: Trade in all countries decreased compared to the previous year. British imports decreased by 14.4%, and exports decreased by 21%. US imports decreased by 30.4%, and exports decreased by 26.7%. Japanese imports decreased by 30.3%, and exports decreased by 31.6%. German imports (cumulative from January to October) decreased by 24.1% compared to the same period last year, and exports decreased by 8.6%. Even in France, which had the best market conditions, imports increased slightly by 1.1%, but exports inevitably decreased sharply by 14.6%. (2) Increase in the number of unemployed: According to estimates by the International Labor Office, the number of unemployed worldwide reached 11.8 million, double that of the previous year. (3) Decline in prices: Since the European War, the world price index had not changed significantly until 1929. In the spring of 1930, prices suddenly fell sharply. According to the British Board of Trade's survey of wholesale prices, taking the average total in 1924 as 100, food (such as grains, fish, meat, etc.) averaged 87.4 in 1929, but fell to 76.1 in 1930, a drop of 11.3. Non-food items (such as steel, coal, and other minerals, cotton, wool, and other textiles, groceries, etc.) averaged 79.4 in 1929 and 69.6 in 1930, a drop of 9.8. If the total at the end of the year is taken as the standard, the decline is even more severe. The important reasons for the world economic decline are nothing more than the following: (1) Overproduction: During the European War, due to food shortages, producing countries such as Canada, the United States, and Australia vigorously encouraged cultivation and expanded production. Over time, it became impossible to sell the surplus. Manufactured goods also suffered from overproduction due to scientific progress, mass production, and tariff wars. Taking the United States as an example, the inventory of wheat alone reached 10.31 million tons in 1930. Other examples include 1.7 million tons of coffee, 1.35 million tons of cotton, and 280,000 tons of rubber. If the United States, which has the strongest purchasing power, is in this situation, the other countries can be imagined. (2) The artificial manipulation of prices: When prices fall, producers suffer. Therefore, governments often use artificial methods to maintain the prices of goods. For example, the United States and Canada purchase or organize groups to hoard wheat, waiting for a shortage to sell at a higher price. However, with successive bumper harvests, the stockpiles increase, exceeding the capacity of financial resources. As a result, they resort to devaluation and dumping, harming not only wheat producers but also preventing them from selling their products to exchange for other goods. As a result, producers of other goods also fall into a stagnant state. (3) Tariff wars: Overproduction means that one's own country cannot consume enough. Therefore, everyone thinks of using neighboring countries as dumping grounds. At the same time, everyone worries about being used as a dumping ground by neighboring countries. As a result, tariffs are raised, and there is mutual resistance, causing goods to circulate abnormally. The United States, with its wealth surpassing the world and its position as the largest creditor nation, also builds high tariff barriers, leading to the loss of the benefits of international division of labor and causing abnormalities in international trade. Producers often feel insecure because they cannot predict their sales, which can even lead to social instability. In countries that implement protectionist policies, they have no choice but to increase domestic production to compensate for the exclusion of foreign goods, further contributing to the trend of overproduction. (4) Uneven distribution of global gold reserves: As of the end of November 1930, the gold reserves of the 45 countries surveyed worldwide were approximately £2.23 billion. The United States accounted for 38.5%, France accounted for 18%, the United Kingdom accounted for 7%, and the remaining 40 countries accounted for 36.5%, totaling only £800 million. After the European War, global gold reserves were gradually absorbed by the United States and France. The gold reserves of other countries decreased daily. Everyone focused on preserving cash, preventing smooth international finance. Countries that are at a disadvantage in exchange rates constantly pay attention to maintaining and stabilizing the monetary system. For example, Japan's implementation of a tight fiscal policy aimed at concentrating its financial resources on the implementation of the gold standard, which has made the state of industrial and commercial depression even more serious, is clear evidence of this. (5) Other factors, such as excessive speculation in the American business community, creating market panic, the continued decline in silver prices, leading to a reduction in the purchasing power of the Chinese and Indian people, and the political instability in China and India, all directly or indirectly have a negative impact on the world market. There are countless studies, expert writings, and financial institution investigation reports on the above-mentioned topics, so there is no need for us to elaborate further. We will now extract a few points that affect our country and describe them as follows: (1) The main reason for the decline in silver prices lies in the excess of supply over demand. The trend is no different from the general decline in prices. In countries that use gold, silver, as a commodity, although it is still a precious metal, its monetary status has gradually weakened, descending to the ranks of general commodities and having to follow the general price trends. The decline in silver prices in 1930 was of great importance to China's finance and economy, which will be detailed in another chapter. (2) Due to the increasing number of unemployed people in various countries, overseas Chinese were the first to suffer. In the Nanyang area, the number of unemployed overseas Chinese was no less than 400,000. Although there are no detailed statistics on the number of people who returned to China because there were no jobs to be found overseas, it was probably no less than 100,000 in 1930. Compared to the past, when tens of thousands of people went abroad every year, the gain and loss are exactly the opposite. It is estimated that in 1929, the amount of money remitted by overseas Chinese to their home country was approximately 300 million silver dollars, calculated at 15 yuan per pound. In 1930, the pound price reached 20 yuan, but the remittances only amounted to 250 million silver dollars, a decrease of one-sixth in silver and two-fifths in gold. This is extremely detrimental to China's national economy and international exchange rates. (3) Theoretically, China's export trade should increase with the decline in silver prices. However, in 1930, the value of exported goods decreased by 120 million Haikwan taels compared to the previous year. The most significant decrease was in silk, with a decrease of 46 million Haikwan taels. Calculated in gold prices, it was only half of the previous year. More than 80% of silk factories nationwide were closed. The second largest decrease was in agricultural products from the three northeastern provinces. The harvest in 1930 was extremely abundant, but soybean exports decreased by 45 million taels. The market in the three provinces fell sharply as a result, and countless soybean oil businesses went bankrupt. Tea exports decreased by 15 million taels, and leather exports decreased by 11 million taels. On the contrary, the decline in world prices also had some benefits for our country, such as the ability to import wheat and cotton at low prices. The domestic yarn and flour industries were not affected by the shortage of raw materials due to the inland wars, and the rise in gold prices did not significantly threaten the people's clothing and food needs. This is worth mentioning. The following table lists the monthly market prices of rice, wheat, oil, and cotton in 1930, as well as the gold price, for comparison.</p>

<h3>Summary of the Sino-Japanese Ancient and Modern Painting Exhibition in Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Hua Chan</p>
<p>Japanese painting originated from China. Therefore, ancient Chinese paintings are especially valued. Recently, the government, in order to promote Oriental art and provide opportunities for the people to appreciate it, specially sent Masaki Naohiko and Watanabe Kazan to China to contact collectors and painters in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Ping, and Liaoning. Preparations were not completed until the end of the previous month. The venue is the Ueno Park Art Museum in Tokyo. The exhibition period is from April 28 to May 19. On the opening day, President Count Kiyoura Keigo Masaki Naohiko and Honorary President Wang Gunfu, the Chinese Minister, delivered opening speeches. Internal Minister Ichiki Kitokuro, Foreign Minister Shidehara, Education Minister Tanaka, and Chinese representatives Wang Yiting, Liang Hongzhi, Yuan Siyong, etc., all gave congratulatory speeches. Celebrities from all walks of life in Tokyo attended the meeting. The ceremony was extremely grand. The venue was quite magnificent, divided into ancient and modern painting sections. The ancient paintings were mostly works from the Qing Dynasty, followed by the Ming Dynasty, then the Yuan Dynasty. Several Song paintings were also on display. Famous works by Huang Zihjiu, Zhu Derun, and Zhao Danian, collected by the former Qing Dynasty Inner Palace in China, were also on display. Collectors such as Liang Hongzhi, Luo Zhenyu, Zhang Hanqing, Kuai Ruomu, Cao Yuandu, Jin Kaifan, and Luo Yuanjue all had valuable exhibits. It is a pity that collectors from Shanghai and Suzhou did not actively participate, resulting in a significant difference from the original number of pieces. On the Japanese side, however, they collected as much as possible. For example, the Imperial Museum, the Tokyo Art School, and famous collectors in Tokyo and Kyoto all exhibited their fine works, totaling more than 300 pieces, all of which were not seen in the previous exhibition of famous paintings from the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties. Although there is no doubt that fake works are mixed in, the essence of Chinese painting can also be shown to the world. The modern painting section has more than 200 pieces, collected from Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, etc. The most numerous are from Shanghai, and they are quite exquisite, as the painters are the most prosperous here. Japanese painters have been working hard to improve in recent years. Each person is limited to one piece in this exhibition, and they are all selected carefully crafted, beautiful, and artistically meaningful works to show the characteristics of Japanese painting. Gathering ancient and modern Chinese and foreign paintings in one hall, the advantages and disadvantages are self-evident. I hope Chinese painters will pay more attention to it. The Japanese government and people have always valued art. The enthusiasm of the visitors to this exhibition, the publicity of the media, and the art atmosphere are very strong. Looking back at China, there is no news. Yesterday, I specially visited the painter Ma Mengrong at Rongzhai in Xieqiao and learned about various news from Dongjing. I urgently recorded one or two points to inform those who care about art. Also, the twenty or so painters who went to Japan to participate in the exhibition were warmly welcomed by the Japanese people. They had almost no free days during their trip. It is said that several people will return to Shanghai in late May.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Grand Occasion of the Women's Temperance Society Congress</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association held the opening ceremony of its Second National Congress at Yipinxiang on the 16th of this month. Representatives from ten provinces, including Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, Jilin, and Liaoning, attended. The scent of perfume and the gleam of hair ornaments filled the hall, making it an unprecedented grand gathering for women in Shanghai. I will record what I saw and heard truthfully, which I believe will also be welcomed by the 200 million female compatriots across the country.</p>
<p>A horizontal banner with the nine characters "When the family is in order, the state is governed, and then the world is at peace" was hung high in the hall. Beside it were couplets that read, "Promote kindness, filial piety, chastity, and frugality" and "Reject tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and vice." On the four walls were posters with slogans such as "Break the decadent polygamous system," "Build a happy monogamous family," "Save the expenses of tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and vice," and "Relieve the suffering of helpless compatriots." Dozens of photographs showcasing the association's various achievements were displayed on both sides, showing scenes of performances, entertainment, and speech contests, all lively and endearing. Portraits of Ms. Willard, the founder of the World Women's Temperance Union, and Ms. Chen Yuling, the pioneer of the temperance movement, were also hung. After signing in, each person was presented with the association's publication, "Temperance," which detailed the drug prevention work and editorial overview of the past ten years. Ms. Yang Meizhen, the chairwoman, wore a small checkered qipao and delivered the opening speech in fluent Mandarin with a composed manner and concise, clear words. Among the representatives, only Madam Zheng Yangxiu and four others wore hair buns. All wore qipaos, with about 30% wearing overcoats and 20% wearing vests over them. In terms of age, those in their twenties were the most numerous, accounting for about 70%. Those under twenty accounted for less than 10%, and those over forty accounted for about 10%. In addition to reporting on the preparatory committee's progress, Liu Wang Liming compared the congress to a furnace, saying that this gathering of opinions from representatives of various provinces, mutual research, was no less than melting various minerals in a furnace to form crystals. She also mentioned that the women's movement in China was still in its infancy, and hoped that the fathers and brothers of the representatives, as well as the male guests present today, would do their best to help. Following this, Mr. Lin Kanghou and Mr. Wang Yunwu successively gave speeches. In addition to agreeing with the Nanjing representatives' four proposals of not hoping to do great things, not talking empty words, focusing on practical work as the goal, not moving people with ideals, and using the most economical methods to do the most work, Mr. Lin also said that the word "temperance" encompasses a great deal. Not only should useless things like tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and vice be tempered, but even beneficial things like reading and exercise should be tempered. Otherwise, overworking the brain or engaging in strenuous exercise can also be dangerous. Mr. Wang said that a recent survey of the habits of prisoners in Shanghai and Hangzhou prisons showed that in Shanghai, 28% smoked opium, 74% smoked cigarettes, 64% drank alcohol, 72% gambled, 32% frequented prostitutes, and 58% were fond of fighting. The habits of prisoners in Hangzhou were less severe than those in Shanghai, which proves that the social environment in Shanghai is worse than in Hangzhou. Your association's goal of rejecting tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and vice carries a major responsibility for transforming society. Today is also the tenth anniversary, and I must come to congratulate you, hoping that your association will develop permanently, tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold, ten thousandfold. Ms. Lin Kecong arrived later, and the chairwoman invited her to speak. Ms. Lin said that although the Civil Code has stipulated equality between men and women, the law is dead. To exercise this women's right, it depends entirely on the educated sisters to come out and educate the uneducated female compatriots. If they still hang yellow cloth sachets on their chests and chant "Amitabha Buddha," I am afraid that even if the law is equal, it will still be of no practical use. Next, Madam Zheng Yangxiu gave a reply speech in Cantonese, saying that "I am an old woman with white hair and I cannot communicate well. I am afraid some people will laugh at my outdated ideas, but I ask myself that although I am an old woman, I can still shoulder social undertakings," and so on. The listeners were moved. After the meeting, there was a banquet. There were many interesting anecdotes told by Yu Rizhang and others at the banquet, but due to space limitations, I will not elaborate.</p>
<h3>Xun Huisheng's Three Famous Plays</h3>
<p>— Xiuhusheng</p>
<p>When Huisheng came to Shanghai before, the plays he performed for three days were all old plays. The opening night was "Hongluanxi." This time, he performed "Xun Guan Niang," "Xiangluodai," and "Qipan Mountain," which inevitably surprised some people. In fact, all three plays are old scripts that have been renovated. Xun Huisheng's art, his singing is unparalleled in its tenderness, and his acting is divine and transformative. There is nothing that is not excellent, and his expressions are especially wonderfully natural, making it difficult to achieve. He is most able to capture the emotions of the audience, making them unable to control their joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. Only in this way can he meet the fundamental purpose of an artist and the aesthetic of the people. "Xun Guan Niang" is a highlight play for both women's roles and martial roles. For decades, only Wang Yaoqing has been known for this. Now, Xun Huisheng is the only one who has inherited its true essence. In all four aspects of singing, acting, reciting, and fighting, he is remarkable. This is truly Huisheng's best play. In the past, when Huisheng performed this play, Yaoqing was in the audience watching the play. Some people shouted that he looked very much like Yaoqing, and some people asked if Yaoqing looked like him. Yaoqing also smiled and agreed that it was excellent, which shows how good it is. "Xiangluodai" is a renovated tragic play for young female roles. The scenes are few but very tight. The strangeness of the plot truly makes people wish they could speak out for the injustice of the characters in the play. Among the plays renovated by Huisheng, this should be the most moving. "Qipan Mountain" is a famous play for martial female roles. Huisheng learned it from Yaoqing. Huisheng is the only one who can capture the charming and elegant humor when Dou Xiantong and Xue Dingshan are arranging their marriage. He has also added many humorous and singing interludes to the old script. It is most appropriate for Huisheng to perform it. From this, it can be seen that all three plays are renovated excellent plays of great value. Everywhere, they do not lose Huisheng's original face. It is expected that on the day of the premiere, it will cause a sensation in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>A Journey Around the Yellow Sea (7)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Speaking of immigration, it is originally a major problem in the three northeastern provinces. In the past five or six years, the people of Shandong have been unable to bear the rampant taxation and have voluntarily moved to the eastern provinces. The cumulative total has been nearly two million people, which has greatly irritated the Japanese. In the past two years, because the mainland has been relatively peaceful, people have gradually moved back. When I passed through Dalian, I asked those who handle immigration affairs and learned that this year the number of people who have moved away is not even more than the number of people who have moved back.</p>
<p>Last year, Zhejiang organized a batch of immigrants to Liaoning. The result was very unsatisfactory. It is heard that few remained. The reason is that the management was improper and the preparations were insufficient. Also, the living habits are too different. The people of Zhejiang take rice as their staple food. Once they arrive in the farmland, they cannot find rice. Even if they do, they cannot afford it. Therefore, they feel greatly distressed. Other customs and habits are different in various ways. As a result, they have no choice but to return. More than ten years ago, we also recruited farmers from Jiangsu to cultivate land in the eastern provinces. In the end, there was no good result. We still recruited people from Hebei and Shandong to go. Generally speaking, people with lower levels of knowledge have no way to get spiritual comfort except for material life. Therefore, they rely on material supply more urgently than those with higher levels of knowledge. Therefore, there is a principle for immigration: only people from place A can be moved to place B, and people from place B can be moved to the mainland, but people from place A cannot be moved directly to place C. Japan moves its own people to South Korea, moves South Koreans to North Korea, and moves North Koreans to Liaoji, also for this reason. Recently, it is heard that Hunan is planning to immigrate people to the eastern provinces to solve the famine problem. I wonder if they can avoid repeating the mistakes of Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Speaking of the rice problem above, if this principle is recognized, I think it is better to recruit people from the Yutian and Fengrun areas of Hebei to teach them how to grow it than to recruit people from other places.</p>
<p>Last year, there was also a variety of reasons for the oversupply of soybeans in the eastern provinces. The number of immigrants increased day by day, the cultivated land was expanded day by day, and it happened to be a bumper year. The amount of production increased greatly, and the price of gold was high and the price of silver was low. The European market was not moving, and Japan wanted to use other things to replace bean cakes as fertilizer and was testing it. For these reasons, a phenomenon of supply exceeding demand was created. When I was in the east, I heard that there were still 80,000 cartloads of soybeans and more than 20,000 cartloads of barley in the port of Harbin—each cart is 1,000 poods, and each pood is 30 catties—a certain bank suffered a loss of more than 38 million yuan due to the purchase of soybeans, which could not be compensated. It then issued 60 million Harbin silver notes to cover it up, which shows the seriousness of the impact.</p>
<p>If the government of the eastern provinces thinks that this phenomenon is a temporary coincidence and will not happen again next year, then so be it. Otherwise, a policy should be decided and announced to the people, reducing the planting of soybeans next year and changing to planting something else, so as to avoid being more and more unable to cope next year. This is the responsibility of the government.</p>

<h3>Hawthorne's Detective Case Takes a Turn (16)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>(6) Surprising News</p>
<p>When I went to Hawthorne's residence to reply, it was already half past ten. His servant, Shi Gui, told me that Hawthorne had gone out in the early morning as usual to engage in outdoor exercise and had not yet returned, not even having had breakfast. I secretly pondered Hawthorne's actions. He must also be investigating this person's whereabouts there. However, he has no basis for it. I can't imagine which way he is proceeding. I sat in his office, smoking a cigarette, quietly waiting for him to return. But after eleven o'clock, the cigarettes in the cigarette case had been consumed three times in a row, but Hawthorne still had not returned to his residence. I patiently waited until a quarter past twelve before I saw Hawthorne come in panting from outside. I saw that his face was calm, and he seemed very tired in spirit. It was obvious that his work this morning must have been very intense. He took off his black thin woolen coat and threw himself onto the easy chair. I asked, "Are you running around for last night's business?" Hawthorne just nodded and groped for a cigarette to smoke. I asked again, "Are there any results yet?" Hawthorne shook his head. "That's grinding the back of the knife. I can't say it yet. How are your results?" I told him what had happened. Hawthorne frowned and slowly said, "That's strange. Could it be that my ideals are wrong?" I caught this sentence and hurriedly asked, "What are your ideals? I haven't heard you say it." Hawthorne paused before saying, "According to my guess, this person is neither robbing nor retaliating, but a kind of acid-base reaction caused by misunderstanding." I asked in surprise, "How do you explain this? Could he be with me—" Hawthorne interrupted, "Exactly with you. You have self-knowledge. This matter is of course due to misunderstanding on his part, but you don't need to defend yourself. Last night you were really closer to your little concubine. According to my cold-eyed observation, because of your little concubine's beauty, besides the one who made it difficult for us, there are several young people who seemed to look at you sideways with envy and jealousy. But you are in the game yourself, and you don't feel it." I felt a little uneasy. My ears were slightly hot. I replied, "I also overthought this point. I tried my best to avoid it at the time. It's just that that Peifen is too childish and insisted on sticking to me." Hawthorne said, "Of course I understand this. But in the eyes of others, that unconscious jealousy is also very natural." I said, "In this case, last night's incident was caused by me. But why did he want to play tricks on you?" Hawthorne said, "What's the question? He must also have realized that one person can't beat four hands. Naturally, he had to find a way to divert me first. Therefore, I am satisfied that I may be able to find out the truth about this person from Peifen's mouth. Do you think she would deliberately hide it from you?" I hurriedly replied, "This will never happen. Her temperament and innocent childishness can guarantee her. I dare say that the word 'trickery' has no place in her mind."</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Standard Strongly Trending Up</h3>
<p>Rumors of Mexico Switching to Gold Coinage</p>
<p>Soaring by Fourteen Taels Outright Yesterday, the gold standard market on the 18th saw a sharp and rapid rise, with only minor fluctuations of around two taels. Throughout the day, there were thirteen or fourteen taels of back and forth movement, ultimately culminating in an astounding surge of fourteen taels. This was truly unbelievable. The pre-market had already exceeded 750 taels, likely due to the decline in the British silver market while foreign exchange rates remained firm, with prices holding steady. Buying sentiment in the market was exceptionally strong, and the post-market was even more aggressive, quickly breaking through the 60-tael barrier. Major players eagerly purchased, and due to the increasingly tight British exchange rates and scarcity of chips, market conditions abruptly shifted to a high point. Industry intentions turned from weak to strong. This morning's large bars are expected to continue falling, it is said.</p>
<p>Breaking the Fifty-Tael Barrier Early This Morning Opening this morning, the July contract added one and a half taels, reaching 749.5 taels. The previous day's large bars reported a low of 1/16, but the silver price did not change. However, private telegrams reported a decline of 1/16, causing some stagnation. There were also rumors of Mexico planning to switch to gold coinage. Subsequently, Yuan Heng, Xin Heng, and others bought in, causing a further rise, totaling 53.67 taels. Foreign exchange tickets were also favorable. In July and August, British Gold Bank initially sold 13.1875, then absorbed 0.1875 until the shilling announcement, when Huabi and others sold 0.1875, and Wanxing Shunli and others also sold, causing it to fall to 51.6 taels. However, the listed price did not change, with only a small reduction of 0.25 for the daily gold and an increase of 0.25 for Hong Kong. Soon, buyers became active, with Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan, Cheng Yong, and others entering the market. In addition, the Japanese Commercial Bank offered 1.125 to 1.1875 for July and August British gold, rising to 550,000 at 10:00 AM. Later, Yuan Cheng, Zhi Feng, and Yong others sold, dropping to 53.34 taels at 10:45 AM. Before long, Yuan Xing, Yong Zhi, Feng Yong, Dade Cheng, and Lai entered, immediately adding to 54.4 taels. However, Qian Changxiang and others sold a significant amount. It hit 53 taels at 11:00 AM, then Xin Heng, Tong Taichang, Fu Xing, Cheng Yu, and others entered, and the August British gold only settled at 1.125, rebounding by 2 taels. At noon, it was 54.9 taels, and it closed at 4.6 taels, later rising to 5.78 taels, prompting Da Xing Yong and others to chase purchases, and the quoted price changed to 783 taels, effectively suppressing it by around 30 taels. Twenty-eight taels were sold at noon.</p>
<p>Post-Market Even Stronger, Breaking the Sixty-Tael Barrier The post-market opened with an increase of 56.8 taels, followed by 7 taels, truly reflecting the residual strength of the afternoon. Then, it slightly weakened by about one tael, hovering with only a few qian of movement. It appeared that British gold settlement was frequent, with July at 1.3125, then only 0.0625. Dalian Huabi initially offered 1.16175, later 1.162. It was also heard that the Indian exchange rate was reported lower by one anna. There were still many buyers on the table, so it rose to 57.8 taels after 2:30 PM. However, Yuan Mao, Yong Heng, Yu, and others sold, causing it to fall by a little more than one tael, totaling 56.56 taels. After 3:00 PM, the exchange rate was particularly strong, only settling at 1.30625 to 1.3. Fuchang, Yuan Heng, Yuan Xing, Yong Zhi, Feng Yong, and Da Xing Yong all bought in, so people's hearts were eager for a higher price, and the market atmosphere was incomparably aggressive, with a tendency to leap thousands of feet. It rose steadily by more than 5 taels, and after 4:10 PM, it broke through the 60-tael barrier. However, there was still one tael of up-and-down movement in between, but the Dalian gang, Tong Taichang, and others entered and exited again. The British Gold Bank absorbed 1.3 until the market closed at 4:30 PM at 62 taels, hence the double settlement price. It continued to rise to around 63 taels, an increase of more than 14 taels compared to the previous weekend (the first day of swap). According to the maximum price of 62 taels and the minimum price of 49.5 taels before and after the market, there was a difference of 13.5 qian. Commodities were at 50 taels in the early market, 55.4 taels at noon, 6.5 taels in the afternoon, and 62.5 taels at closing. The quoted price was suppressed by 26-27 taels, and finally, the account was closed at only 21 taels. The morning registry was 53 taels to 55 taels, and the afternoon registry was 60 taels to 62 taels. The water supplement was 51 taels in the morning and 58 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Strong Demand and Limited Supply According to the transactions of various firms, there was strong demand and limited supply. Yuan Cheng Yong, Heng Yu, Heng Xing, Da De Cheng, Yu Da, Hong Li, Da Xing Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Xin Heng, and Zhi Feng Yong all entered the market, while Wan Xing, Shun Li, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Kang Xiang, Yuan Da, and Qian Chang Xiang were mostly selling. Fu Chang and Yuan Heng were hedging, while Yuan Mao Yong sold more than 700 bars in total, and Tong Taichang sold a total of more than 800 bars. Generally, there were more entries than exits. In the afternoon, Tian Yu Yong, Yuan Tai, Xin Heng, Yuan Heng, Da Xing Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, and Shun Li all entered the market. Wan Xing, Tong Taichang, Fu Chang, Da De Cheng, and Fu Tai Heng had frequent ups and downs. Heng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Qian Fu Xiang, and other retail bulls all sold. Commodity bars were issued and collected quickly. The Cantonese bullish faction did not move, so there were very few entries and exits. The Dalian gang had both strong demand and supply, issuing more than 3,500 bars and entering more than 2,7800 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Following Gold Market's Aggressive Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listing only reduced 0.25 for daily gold, totaling 1.1625 taels, and added 0.25 for Hong Kong, totaling 79.125 taels. The French franc added half a yuan, totaling 777 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. As for the domestic market, it has become tight, and the gold market has become aggressive, breaking through the 760-tael barrier, which is inexplicable. However, it is heard that the overseas silver market has declined, and there are rumors that Mexico is selling spot silver and switching to gold coinage. Comparing the results of each exchange rate with the previous weekend, British gold was reduced by 0.25, US gold was reduced by half a yuan, and Japanese gold was increased by 0.0275. It is the so-called bright flat, dark sharp. Chinese merchants in the gold industry are climbing bravely, with British gold trading about 400,000 to 500,000 pounds. The bank's selling momentum is quite strong, and US gold is about 400,000 yuan, and Japanese gold is more than 1 million yuan, all in Dalian, and the various firms are mostly hedging in the gold standard market. Mumbai sold British gold in the morning, and the Indian exchange rate has slightly reported lower, so today's big bars may fall, it is said.</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate The domestic market, from morning to night, had a total of 0.1875 reversals, but none exceeded the trading volume. Since the morning, the offer price has been one shilling, two pence, and 0.1875, and the buying price has been 0.25. HSBC initially sold 0.1875 in October, and the Shanghai opening price also offered it. Mitsui and Huabi entered 0.1875 (Mumbai single). Citibank and Huabi offered 0.1875 in July and August (Cheng Feng Yong entered). After 10:00 AM, Mitsui and Sumitomo offered 0.125 to 0.1875, Taiwan and Sumitomo offered 0.06125, and East Asia offered 0.125 in August. After 11:00 AM, Zhejiang and HSBC offered 0.125 to 0.1875 in July and August. The noon closing offer price was 0.125, and the entry price was 0.1875.

After 4:00 PM, Huabi offered three pence to 0.0625, and Mitsui and Huabi offered three pence. HSBC entered three pence, so the gold price broke through 6 taels. By closing, the offer price was three pence to two pence 0.9375, and the buying price was three pence.</p>
<p>US Exchange Rate The domestic market had a total difference of 0.3756 throughout the day. The morning offer price was 10.075 yuan, and the buying price was 8.75 yuan.

<h3>Overview of the Sideways Movement of the Silver Dollar</h3>
<p>Market Overview This year's business in the financial sector is quite sluggish. It is now the silkworm season, but the situation is quiet. The need is such that one can imagine the rest of the market situation. Therefore, there is no possibility of the silver dollar soaring, and the current scattered and swirling movements are minimal. That is why. As for the silver market atmosphere, because the market prospects are not optimistic, there has been no development. As a result, there is neither a large demand nor a large expansion.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices (Silver Dollar) The early market interest rate was slightly better by half a li than the previous day's noon market, at 7 qian, 2 fen, 8 li, 7 hao, 5 si. The noon market weakened back by 2 hao and 5 si, at 7 qian, 2 fen, 8 li, 6 hao, 2 hu and 5 si, resulting in a better result by 2 hao and 5 si. (Silver Remittance) It has been stable for a long time, quiet and uninspiring, so it has been no more than a few fen in the market for several days. Yesterday, the early and noon markets both opened at 5 fen, slightly smaller by one fen than the previous day. There were also two or three fen of water added to the settlement.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation Jiangnan small silver coins suddenly rose to 6 qian, 5 fen, 8 li in the morning, which was 5 li higher than the early market the previous day. The noon market fell back by 3 li, to 6 qian, 5 fen, 5 li. 4,000 jiao of transactions were made in the early market, and 2,500 jiao were made in the noon market. Guangdong small silver coins were at 6 qian, 4 fen, 6 li, 2 hao, 5 si in the early market, and 6 qian, 4 fen, 6 li, 5 hao in the noon market. The result was the same as the previous noon market. 70,000 jiao of transactions were made in the early market, and only 10,000 jiao were made in the noon market. Copper coins did not move, still at 380 qian per 500 wen.</p>

<h3>Securities The Tariff of 1920 Plummeted Greatly</h3>
<p>Other Stocks Rose Initially Then Fell, Resulting in Weakness</p>
<p>Trading Volume Continued to Reach Over 25 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond futures market continued to be extremely active. The trading volume reached 16 million yuan between the two sessions in the morning. In the afternoon, due to incomplete settlement of the morning market, trading only started at 3:30 PM, resulting in only one trading session. However, the trading volume still reached over 8.7 million yuan. The spot market, however, remained quiet. Bond prices fluctuated greatly. As a result, the 1920 Tariff bonds plummeted by more than two yuan. The 1919 Tariff and 1920 Rolled bonds also fell by more than one yuan. Other bonds fell by varying amounts of around half a yuan. The total futures trading volume for the day exceeded 25 million yuan, while spot trading amounted to 7,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton The Yarn Market Showed a Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>The yarn market was slightly firm, but the overseas cotton market remained weak. There were still many rumors about the political situation, so the pressure from sellers was still intense. Therefore, the market trend was still weak. As soon as the market rose, the selling pressure became even stronger. It was also said that the 10-count coarse yarn was particularly sluggish, with very thick inventories. There are explanations for a large number of deliveries this month, and the sellers' momentum is very strong. However, a certain large merchant's attitude was calm and he still had no intention of loosening up. He remains unmoved regarding the large amount due this month. One party said that they are probably preparing to take in more than 10,000 bales. However, exchange rates are difficult to loosen, and gold prices have risen again, so there is still hope for exports. As for the sales of 10-count coarse yarn, if there are no extremely large changes in the political situation, there may be large sales venues.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Morning Low, Afternoon High</h3>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. American cotton continued to fall, but exchange rates were tight and gold prices rose again, causing people's hearts to tighten. However, most retail investors sold short and looked down, which was due to the exhaustion of inventories. Although there were adverse circumstances, the market was unable to fall sharply. However, the situation was ultimately flat.</p>

<h3>Grains Passenger Rice Gradually Rises by Two or Three Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Passenger Rice market was firm and brisk. Because the rice arriving from the river downstream was scarce and expensive, the local market paid attention to Passenger Rice. After repeatedly adding to stock in recent days, the market's inventory was dwindling daily, and prices gradually rose. The previous day, more than 2,000 bags were traded, and the price had already risen by a corner or so. Yesterday, the local market's appetite was even better, and prices jumped another one or two jiao, which is more than three jiao higher than the average market price in the middle of last week. Throughout the day, more than 3,000 bags of Jiangxi Machine Late Rice were traded, priced at 11 yuan and 4 jiao to 1 jiao. 50 bags of Kehong Machine Late Rice were traded, priced at 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 6 jiao, and 7 fen. 200 bags of Machine Yuan Rice were traded, priced at 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 2 jiao, and 8 fen. 700 bags of Hunan Machine Oil Rice were traded, priced at 11 yuan, 4 jiao to 2 jiao and a half. 430 bags of Nanjing Willow Rice were traded, priced at 10 yuan and 2 jiao. Although the market was similar to the previous market, the lower quality goods were priced higher.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Continues to Have Large Volume Trading</h3>
<p>There have been many new transactions of imported rice in recent days. Grain merchants, foreign firms, and out-of-town merchants are extremely interested. There has already been trading of returned goods in the market. Since the prices of Dumi Rice and Passenger Rice rose, the appetite of importers has been even better, and prices have been rising step by step. The previous day, 800 tons of No. 1 Saigon Rice were traded, and the price had already risen compared to the previous fixed price. Yesterday, another 1,000 tons were traded, with the end-of-June forward price being 5 taels and 5 qian and a half, sold by Xiangmao. Wanxing also sold 100 tons for delivery within the month at a price of 5 taels and 6 qian and a half, and Tongxingtai sold 1,400 tons of June Xiaojiao Rice at a price of 5 taels and 3 qian. 1,000 tons of June Mindang Rice were also sold at a price of 5 taels and 4 qian. The prices are all two or three qian higher than those sold for the first time earlier last week. If importers are greedy for sales, the market may have good years.</p>
<h3>Flour Auction Soars Vigorously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the flour market saw another vigorous surge in prices. Because the rain had been very heavy the previous day, and it had not stopped slightly until yesterday before the opening, although the quoted price of imported wheat was only a small three or four jiao, the thoughts of the inland merchants were ultimately that it was not suitable to have this kind of weather as the new wheat was about to enter the market, so the buying pressure was extremely strong when the price opened, and people's hearts were especially unusually excited. This month's highest price was 2 taels, 0 qian, 9 fen, and a half, June was 2 taels, 0 qian, 9 fen, and 2 li and a half, July was 2 taels, 0 qian, 9 fen, and a half, August was 2 taels, 0 qian, 9 fen, and 7 li and a half, September was 2 taels, 1 qian, 2 fen, and 2 li and a half, and October was 2 taels, 1 qian, 3 fen, and 7 li and a half, which was two or three fen higher than the closing price of the previous week. However, after the second session, because the telegraph of foreign flour had turned, the number of packages sold by the out-of-town merchants on Red Day was 60,000, and the price was 2 yuan and 5 jiao and a half (it was heard that the number of foreign wheat being negotiated was also more than 100,000 tons). Therefore, the market suddenly weakened, and fell by one or two fen from the peak. When the market opened in the afternoon, because the rain had not stopped, people's hearts were still firm. At the fourth session, it had once softened, and then it recovered. Observing the future steps, if the sky does not clear, people's hearts will certainly be strong, but if this is held, it will be no different than creating an opportunity for smooth entry. As a result, May and September rose by 1 fen and 2 li and a half from the previous week, June and July rose by 1 fen and a half, August rose by 1 fen and 7 li and a half, and October rose by 2 fen and 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Soars by More Than One Qian</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures were quite stable at first. Because the quoted price of imported wheat was only a small three or four jiao, most people were watching. Because the interior considered the weather to be incorrect, it was difficult to clear up temporarily, so the buying pressure revived, and the market price stepped up step by step. When the market opened at the tenth noon, because of the vigorous rise in the flour market in the morning, people's hearts had been aroused, and the opening price was still flat, but it immediately stepped up step by step. The smoothness of the transaction and the madness of the rise were rare this year. However, the only goal is the weather, and in fact, it is still not discussed. The recent series is the new wheat stall, and the rise is even more. The long-term period is relatively gentle because of the rumor of the sale of foreign wheat. As a result, this month soared 1 qian and 3 fen higher than the previous day, June rose 1 qian and 2 fen, July rose 1 qian and 1 fen, August rose 9 fen, September rose 6 fen, and October rose 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Foreign Firms' Silk Market is Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firms' silk market became even more quiet. The overseas market and the sales of Chinese silk factories still had no turning point. The telegraph price was small. It was difficult for Chinese merchants to sell, and the market sentiment was upheld. Yesterday, only Xinfu purchased five packages of Shanghai White Silk, Zhonghe, etc. purchased twenty packages of White Qian Silk, and Kechang purchased twelve packages of Silk Group Yellow Silk. The prices were all firm.</p>
<h3>Qi Tea Trading Volume Exceeded 2,000 Boxes</h3>
<p>The Market Plummets by Twenty to Thirty Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firms' tea market, Jardine Matheson, Xingcheng, Tianxiang, Tianyu, and other firms showed strong interest in red teas from Qimen, Fuliang, and other regions. The total trading volume for the city was 2,482 boxes. Trading was still not lonely. However, because there were so many goods arriving, the price limits set by the traders were stricter than those of last week. However, goods with excellent leaf bottom production methods could still stabilize the market. The prices of medium and low-grade goods had already plummeted by twenty to thirty taels. According to a telegram from London, the United Kingdom had a very urgent need for Qimen's high and medium-grade red teas. However, the current market price was considered quite expensive. Whether the market could remain firm was still difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Hunan and Hubei New Tea Sells Well in Stores and Firms</h3>
<p>The richness of tea production in Hunan and Hubei ranks first in the country. In the past, foreign firms exported no less than 400,000 boxes of red tea. In recent years, due to frequent conflicts and blockages, exports have been sluggish, and tea merchants are running out of money. Today, the situation has become the end of the line. In the past two years, the red tea from Hunan and Hubei that has been transported to Shanghai and sold to foreign firms is less than one-tenth of what it used to be. If there is no vitality in exports, the export of red tea from Hunan and Hubei will become a thing of the past. According to a telegraph from Hankou and Gao, the new teas in Hunan and Hubei Provinces, except for Anhua and Taoyuan, famous tea-producing areas in Hunan, red tea has already opened at the beginning of the scale, and the price is from 32, 33 yuan to 28 yuan. Other Tongshan, Yangloudong, Beigang, and Green Tea in Hubei Province have also opened at the beginning of the scale, and the price is from 40 to 20 yuan. Many tea shops in Hankou have sent partners to the mountains to search for goods, and their appetite is extremely healthy. The sales venues of stores and firms in North China and East Province have recently become more prosperous. The tea market situation seems to be much better for stores and firms than for foreign firms.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Japanese Sugar Factory Trading Brisk</h3>
<p>Market Prices All Rise… Our Factory's Rock Sugar Gradually Rises by Two Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were still no market reports from the sugar production area. The atmosphere of the market's price division was quite good, and the trades were very active. The initial market price of 24 Dutch Crude Sand White was 10 taels and 09 qian, and Hong Kong goods were 10 taels and 08 qian and a half. The buying sentiment was still strong, and it then rose to 10 taels, 09 qian and 2.5 to 10 taels, 09 qian and a half. Medium Sand White was 10 taels, 04 qian to 4 qian and a half, and the trend was still strong. The Japanese sugar market also stepped up. N Mark was 10 taels, 09 qian to 2.5 fen, TK Mark was 10 taels, 09 qian to 9 qian and a half, YT Mark was 10 taels, 08 qian and a half to 8 qian and 7.5 fen, and finally to 10 taels, 09 qian. YRO Mark was 10 taels, 03 qian and a half, Minghua goods were 10 taels, 04 qian, YP Mark was 11 taels and 3 qian, JH Mark was 10 taels and 05 qian, J Mark was 11 taels, 3 qian and a half to 4 qian, import and export were very smooth, and the market shape was very beautiful. The factory's Dali sugar for July and August opened at 15,000 packages, priced at 4 yuan and 4 jiao in Japanese currency. Meiji Sugar's price for July and August was 4 yuan and 3 jiao and a half in Japanese currency. These were the remaining 10,000 packages that had been sold previously. All were sold. However, the buying intention of the firms was still strong, and if there were telegraphic orders, Taikoo carriage sugar would be opened for thousands of packages of HX Mark, priced at 10 taels, 07 qian and a half, DY Mark at 10 taels, 08 qian and a half, CW Mark at 11 taels, 1 qian and a half, HM Mark at 10 taels, 02 qian and a half, and H Mark at 9 taels and 7 qian and a half. But B Mark goods were lacking. Fortunately, Huaxinhao had ordered B Mark from the company, and the goods had arrived, so 4,000 packages were sold at a price of 11 taels and 2 qian, which was quite beautiful. Hao Pan had Zhenxianghao selling more than 4,000 bags of crude Sand White, priced at 10 taels, 09 qian and a half, and 2,000 bags of old goods were also opened, priced at 10 taels and 05 qian, and 3,000 bags of Medium Sand White were opened, priced at 10 taels and 03 qian. Jinfahao had the same price, and more than 1,000 bags were sold, and the market was quite strong. This factory, Binghua Qing Yufa Hao, sold more than 200 packages, and the price rose to 9 taels and 7 qian. The Shanghai factory sold hundreds of packages of rock sugar from the factory, with the Renzi price at 13 taels and 8 qian, and the Ganzi price at 13 taels and 7 qian, which was 2 qian higher than the previous trading session, and the market sentiment was quite tight, with all showing signs of a gradual increase.</p>
<h3>Hardware The Supply of Lihou Iron is Tight</h3>
<p>The trade in tinplate has been very smooth recently. Can factories, tobacco companies, biscuit factories, and iron printing factories have all purchased. However, the source is shallow, and there is a sign that the current goods are tight. Standards such as 90-pound British goods can be estimated at 16 taels and 3 qian and a half per box, 100 pounds at 17 taels, 90-pound American goods at 17 taels and 2 qian and a half, and 100 pounds at 18 taels again. It is said that 90-pound British goods are especially scarce in the market, so the market situation is better than others. After investigation, the goods to be approved will take many days, so it is expected that the market will continue to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods Hainan Yuan Meat Gradually Rises by Three Taels and a Half</h3>
<p>Hainan Yuan meat had previously fallen to 30 taels and a half due to sluggish sales. However, there have been no new arrivals for a long time, and there have also been few arrivals of other types of Yuan meat. It is also said that the phenomenon of the Guiyuan seedlings in the producing area is not good, and this year's voice is new, and the harvest will be poor, so the ship has repeatedly tightened. The initial opening was 32 taels, and then rose to 34 taels, which is three taels and a half higher than the low price. Check that the bottom is already limited, and the market still prevents further increases.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Asphalt Becomes More and More Inflamed</h3>
<p>Since the asphalt market in Hankou re-Jing for 26 taels, it has been increased by 2 qian. Macheng oil is made for 25 taels. The source is still scarce, and the supply is not enough to meet the demand. There is no accumulation in this port. The soap factories that the dealers sold to earlier have not yet settled, and the candle makers are also waiting for the goods. In Zhejiang, the price of Neiping oil has been sold for more than 40 yuan per piece, and there is no goods at the price. Lanolin also needs 35 yuan. This car oil in Jiaxing also wants more than 40 yuan. According to the total, there are less than a thousand pieces, and there is no large vote that can be opened. In short, this year's market has never been seen before. Now it is getting more and more fierce, and it is impossible to estimate the degree to which it can be determined.</p>

<h3>Qing'e Drama Society Performs a Patriotic Heart</h3>
<p>This is something that no one could have imagined. Beforehand, there was no sound or shadow. Suddenly, a thunderbolt from a clear sky broke through this silent Shanghai - the establishment of the Qing'e Drama Society.</p>
<p>Even they themselves were in a daze, and they were able to accomplish such an amazing record, which was really unexpected. Their motivation for initiating and organizing this drama society was last month - after seeing a letter from Mr. Gu Jianchen to the Shen Bao's "Art World," he said, "A Patriotic Heart" had achieved very good results in the Zhenjiang performance and was very popular among the audience. The future of Chinese new drama has released light, and the hope is very great... After they read the above facts, their competitive hearts did not allow us to hesitate any longer, and they immediately wanted to compete with the Jiangsu Provincial Educational College, which was hosted by Mr. Shigu, so they quickly gathered their comrades and immediately rehearsed "A Patriotic Heart."</p>
<p>As for why no one knew about it beforehand, it was because their goal was to fight and did not want to make a big fuss in advance, because past facts told us that the results were not satisfactory if we talked about it in advance, so they refused to repeat the same mistakes. Therefore, they rehearsed the drama day and night, and the people outside were sleeping in the drum, and they did not announce it to the public until the opportunity came.</p>
<p>This is indeed their luck and their good omen. It happened that Tongji wanted to hold a commemorative meeting on May 19 and invited them to join the performance. Of course, they would not lose this rare opportunity, so it aroused their excitement even more, and they were willing to sacrifice everything to fulfill their obligations to the drama. The results of this exercise were still able to fulfill their wishes, which gave them ten thousand times more courage.</p>
<p>The members of this drama society are composed of enthusiastic drama comrades from schools along the Yanjiangwan Road area. Their ambitions are great, and they are not limited to one corner. Anyone who expresses sympathy for them has the possibility of joining Qing'e.</p>
<p>This complicated Shanghai is enough to make us feel bored. Although there was a enthusiastic drama movement last year, and the future of the Chinese drama world seemed to have a bright future, it was not long before it disappeared and disappeared again, either because of the diversion of thought or because the organization was not sound. We are now also worried that the desert flower that has just sprouted in the desert will be blown away by a huge wind halfway through. We hope that comrades who express sympathy for the society will jointly shoulder the responsibility of nurturing.</p>
<h3>Unimaginable</h3>
<p>- Jianqiu</p>
<p>Unimaginable, because of an unimportant thing, I suddenly went to Hangzhou. The round-trip expenses did not cost me a penny. Is there such a cheap thing in the world? It really makes me feel strange.</p>
<p>I feel tired of the gorgeous spring. Although I have a little responsibility for the affairs, I am interested in this trip under such circumstances.</p>
<p>The wall clock at the station struck seven, and the locomotive's whistle wailed. Then, the wheels gradually moved, and wisps of black smoke lingered in the silent clear sky. At this time, the prosperous Shanghai gradually left me and retreated backwards.</p>
<p>Sitting near the car window, I closed my eyes from time to time to imagine the scenery of Hangzhou. At this time, the ancient ruins and famous scenic spots that I had long wanted to visit were spread out before me.</p>
<p>When the car passed Longhua, looking out from the car window, the peach blossoms of red and white intermingled on both sides of the track were swaying by the warm spring breeze, and a slight fragrance wafted towards my nostrils from time to time. Hehe, you mesmerizing peach blossoms.</p>
<p>"...The Wuling people have disappeared, and they are still red to people..."</p>
<p>The scenery changes with the distance from the city. The farther away from Shanghai, the tempting and intoxicating scenery gradually disappears before me. All that is left is the clear, leisurely, and vast suburban scenery, the vast sky, the scattered floating clouds, and the lovely green grass. When the car passed Songjiang and Jiaxing, the rapeseed flowers in the fields were densely blooming, and the bees and butterflies were recklessly trampling on the stamens. At this time, the train rushed forward rapidly, and the rumbling of the machine and the desolate long stay aroused my passionate emotions.</p>
<h3>Corner of the Sports Field</h3>
<p>— Ice Photography</p>
<p>As we neared Chang'an, the rapeseed flowers gradually thinned out. The fields on both sides had been replanted with mulberry trees. Two or three village women, bent at the waist, were cutting fresh green grass. When the train passed, they all looked up with attention. Ah, that healthy body, full muscles, and healthy eyes—this is truly the only beauty of mankind. Compared to those weak urban women who use fragrant powder to paint their faces very white in order to seduce the opposite sex, they are truly more natural and beautiful. I... ah, yes, I curse the women who use white powder to cover their original faces and seduce people, weaklings who can only consume and not produce anything.</p>
<p>At this time, the train was speeding forward, approaching its destination moment by moment. My heartstrings also became tense. The beautiful scenery of this ancient site and scenic spot, which I had fantasized about for so long and was finally about to realize, frequently appeared in my mind in many strange illusions.</p>
<p>Originally, upon arriving in Hangzhou, I would naturally have many opportunities for sightseeing. Moreover, the location where I needed to conduct business was the Kadoorie Garden by the lake, which gave me even more opportunities for sightseeing.</p>
<p>After a long whistle, the train arrived in Hangzhou. —Each whistle made my heartstrings tense for a moment, and this time it truly arrived. —It was already one o'clock in the afternoon. Originally, I had no luggage, so I walked leisurely out of the station empty-handed. Many rickshaw pullers came up to solicit business.</p>
<p>"Sir, would you like a rickshaw?"</p>
<p>"How much to Kadoorie Garden by West Lake?"</p>
<p>"Six dimes, silver coin," he stretched out a hand, gesturing the number "six" to me.</p>
<p>"No, four dimes, silver coin, plus fourteen copper coins. Will you go?"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, I'll take you."</p>
<p>He respectfully lowered the rickshaw. So, I jumped in. Sitting silently in the rickshaw alone, I seemed to feel a slight loneliness. So, I asked him intentionally or unintentionally,</p>
<p>"Is West Lake far from here?"</p>
<p>"Not far," he replied breathlessly, "Not far. You'll see West Lake when we get to Qixia."</p>
<p>The slightly warm spring breeze brushed across my forehead, and I felt a drunken warmth in my heart. At this time, the rickshaw had arrived at Qixia, and West Lake was gradually getting closer. Ah, the dreamlike, faint green mountains embraced West Lake on three sides. The rippling lake water, half-reflected by the sunlight, reflected an even stronger light. The verdant willow branches, green and fluttering, brushed against the faces of passersby. This natural wilderness scene in spring has already given me satisfaction beyond consciousness. However, an official tour of the lake has not yet been attempted. This is the expectation of the shortest possible future.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Reviews</p>
<h3>Our Witness</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jianbai</p>
<p>By Ms. Huiyi, published by Guanghua Bookstore</p>
<p>Ms. Chen Congyi, who is getting married on May 22, recently published her collection of creative works, "Our Witness." I received a complimentary copy and read it with pleasure. This collection contains five pieces of writing: 1. "Our Witness," 2. "Wutong Courtyard," 3. "Light Smoke," 4. "Eternal Regret," 5. "Doubt." Overall, the collection focuses on the sentiments of young men and women and is meticulously described in terms of technique. It is truly a work of "talent and emotion."</p>
<p>The most important piece of writing in the collection is, of course, her representative work, "Our Witness." This piece depicts the union of a young couple in love. From the perspective of a woman, Yun, it reflects on a current event—a pair of her friends who, united by love, separated due to misunderstandings. The man then married another woman, divorced again, and then asked the first divorced woman to take back spilled water—this really gave Yun a major stimulus. Therefore, she wanted to call off her engagement to her Ying, saying,</p>
<p>"Men in the world are all unreliable. His current affectionate tenderness is a hint of future trampling. Humans are selfish and self-serving, especially men. Humans are inherently weary of the old and fond of the new, especially men. Humans are originally nine-tailed foxes, cunning and deceitful. Humans are originally actors, monkeys inseparable from masks. What is liked today, who knows may be disliked tomorrow. What is disliked tomorrow, who knows may be loved the day after tomorrow..."</p>
<p>"Light Smoke" depicts a young girl with a heart full of helpless emotions, with a section in the middle about the interests of young girls, describing the scenery of the boudoir in a rather vivid way.</p>
<p>"Yifang, haven't you gotten up yet? What a lazybone!" Two people squeezed into the room. The first was the cousin Xueqin, followed by Yifen. Cousin Xueqin walked forward in three steps and wanted to drag her out, scaring her into begging,</p>
<p>"Give me three minutes to get out of bed."</p>
<p>They sat shoulder to shoulder on the sofa by the window behind the screen.</p>
<p>"Have you eaten breakfast?" Yifang asked while buttoning her buttons.</p>
<p>"I ate it early,"</p>
<p>"What about cousin?"</p>
<p>"I'm already hungry at this moment after eating it."</p>
<p>Xueqin always speaks so frankly, so her nickname is Miss Worry-Free.</p>
<p>"Miss Worry-Free, don't encounter the Worry-Free Gentleman, then it will be over," Yifang teased her like this.</p>
<p>"Lying in bed early in the morning, you were originally fantasizing about the Worry-Free Gentleman."</p>
<p>"Eternal Regret" is interspersed with the love of a loving mother and the love between the sexes. The ending, a song of eternal regret, is sincere and heartfelt, which should make all mothers in the world shed tears when they read it. Here, the author's literary foundation is fully demonstrated.</p>
<p>The story "Doubt" is about a student studying abroad named Yun who, because of a letter he wrote to his fiancée Ms. Li Shan in his homeland, mentioned the American woman Helena, giving Ms. Shan a major stimulus. Later, after Yun's long letter explained, the "cloud of doubt finally dissipated, welcoming Ms. Helena to China." According to my oversensitive mind, Li Shan in the article seems to be the author's pseudonym, and Yun is Ying. Whether I guessed correctly, please ask the author to tell me.</p>
<p>Ms. Huiyi graduated from the Faculty of Arts of Chizhi University and is currently the head of the Chinese department at Peicheng Girls' School. She has a literary talent, and her poems and lyrics are valued in the contemporary literary world. We can often read her excellent works in various newspapers and magazines. However, in the past, people admired her old literature, which reached its peak. Now, after the publication of "Our Witness," we even more praise the success of her new creations. According to the author, after "Our Witness," there will be the publication of a collection of poems titled "Green Waves," which will certainly add a large amount of vitality to the current writing world. We can only sincerely hope that "Green Waves" will be published soon, and give us a chance to read it first.</p>
