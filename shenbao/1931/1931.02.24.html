<h3>英國政黨之分離</h3>
<p>古人有言。分久之後秘合合久之後必分。然以人事之經騐而言。由合趨分易。</p>
<p>由分趨合難。蓋以人心不同。多自以爲是。苟有智識才能及勢力者。决不肯屈己以就人也。英國之政治。久以兩大黨聞於世。自工黨因時而生。峙立於保守自由兩黨之外鼎立而三。自由黨復以内部分立。致自削其勢力之後。保守黨與工黨。遂迭相執政。所謂自由黨者。已成爲兩大黨之外。一舉足重輕之黨而已。故以現在論。英國之政黨勢力。仍不失爲兩黨勢力也。</p>
<p>今聞保守黨中。爲帝國派報紙大王比羅兩氏所分裂。又因對印問題。黨中重要分子邱吉爾與黨魁包爾温政見不合而不問黨。務保守黨之分裂。已無可避免矣。至於工黨内部部。亦不一致。前曾供職内閣之摩斯萊氏。因未採用其救濟失業政策。而將出黨以别組一國家社會黨是其分裂亦所難免。是英國兩大黨之政治。行將各各分裂而成爲無數小黨。如歐陸法德等之政治矣。民族性之雖云永久。而亦不能無變遷。於此可見矣。</p>

<h3>羅家將首立戰功</h3>
<p>兩方擇門、我得背日之利、敵方名爲俱樂部、實則揀選各隊精銳而成軍、個個奮起精神、爲雪日前屢戰皆北之恥、故開戰之始、卽猛力進攻、而我方乘屢戰皆捷餘威、亦不示弱、未五分鐘、黑將軍大展其鐵頭工夫、羅家將大顯其長脚本領、頭顱一擊不中、長脚接戰成功、球應聲入網、第一道防禦線旣被我軍佔着、其勇氣遂覺百倍、</p>
<h3>敵軍反攻奪佔地</h3>
<p>敵方雖開仗受創、然銳氣究不少捶、左鋒得球後、其正前鋒卽在我城壘十餘碼遠射、雖被守門將軍擊出、然球已入界、判爲有效、所得第一道防禦線、未五分鐘久卽被奪回、則敵方實力、其可輕視乎、</p>
<p>▲兩軍衝鋒展神威</p>
<p>兩方旣打成平手、此爲戰拉撤隊以後、（第一次比賽、敵方惟一成績也、自然各奮起精神、羅家將得梅洪寳之挑傳、奔前跪射、惜過高越網、大失入塲機會、自此敵方前鋒諸將、爭顯其好身手、反守爲攻、聯絡傳遞、遠攻近襲、其敵踪時見於我疆塲間、幸中樞獲法將軍與左右衞陳家球梁樹棠坐鎭三城、策應備至、再進二城、則有銅頭鐵脚之爲二將軍與江善敬、守禦堅固、故敵方進攻、皆無功而還、而我方乘彼稍示疲乏、號令一施、亦向敵疆進逼、一時黑將軍得後方之接濟、由右猛踢、乃球勢由地上滾進被敵方門將臥地推出、而戴中鋒得球、卽傳與梁樹棠、梁傳與符和萱、符帶球上前、正欲顯飛渡長江本領、　對方中衞將球場出、未幾敵前鋒截得球後、疾盤　進、我方前鋒諸將、正馳騁敵疆、奔救不及、幸中樞護法軍謹爲接應、始將敵兵擊出、此爲兩方混戰時間、迨上半塲結束、遂以一對一打成和局云、</p>
<p>▲兩方競爭佔先着</p>
<p>休息旣過、戰事再開、其競爭尤見激烈、蓋各欲佔先一着也、敵方乘我軍空虛、衝鋒直入、幸馬二將軍與江善將、拚命趕回、始化險爲夷、我方得球、亦不示弱、由戴中鋒盤　直上、傳交梅洪寳、梅又交回、戴猛力施射、過高出界、敵方得球、名進兵來侵、右鋒對準射城、爲謝守門擊出、戴中鋒得球、傳與黑將軍、此兩虎將兼程并進、觀、</p>
<p>衆皆懷有成功希望、未對準敵門、卽被彼後衞踢出、敵前鋒乘機高吊一球、爲謝守門冲出踢去、陳秉祥截得後立傳與黑將軍、用頭擊去、亦被敵門將拾得踢出、此幾分鐘間、一往一來、幾各顯其鬥神本領也、</p>
<p>▲陳羅合作奏奇功</p>
<p>似此相持不下、紅日將西、時間又過、第一不愼、使敵方再進一球、則曁大之英各、將受莫大影響、此觀衆皇皇爲我方擔憂也、然曁亠諸　兒、至此於羣衆努力中、且用出奇制勝法矣、黑將軍得後方之球、急傳與羅家將、羅不忙不慌、後右攻球、一踢入網、而僑衆鬱久之歡聲、始破空而出、自此敵方雖屢有反攻之勇力、我方則精神百倍更加奮勇、至完塲時以二對一勝、</p>
<p>▲當場領得優勝品</p>
<p>在未比賽之先、慈善會總幹事、聲明預備大銀杯一座、爲此回比賽之優勝隊奬、結果應爲我方所得、當塲由農務天産部主任給奬、戴中鋒領謝、全隊健兒、共奏得勝之呼聲、以作完塲點綴、</p>

<p>昨過楓園。紅樹生示我頂湖感舊圖卷。國長三丈餘。製作甚精。出於鄭午昌手筆。爲生紀念其畏友逸冰者也。逸冰籍隸鑑湖。生長嶺海。畢業粤女師範。工藝術。能文章。性情高古。睥睨羣倫。年至二五。尚未字人。戚友有勸婚者。輙一笑置之。旣晤生。一見如故。歡若平生。生雖有身世難言之恫。女士矢志相交。論文談詩。頗以爲樂。旋因他故。中途分袂。相思兩地。惟有寂寞詩書。生掳　懷舊之蓄念。繪圖以志惓惓。蓋亦不勝天末飛鴻之感矣。午昌跋畫云。鑑湖韋女士。秀慧絶世。與紅樹生有文字緣。顧阻於環境。中道判袂。女士以雖願未償。而矢志不渝。黯然銷魂。飄然遠引。生亦嗒然若喪。東走海上。偶話前塵。輒爲涙下。而於壬戍暮春頂湖情事。尤縈寤寐。爰囑寫此圖。以志幽恨。余念亡友印仙女士。南屏墓草。今已九靑。有情眷屬。定遭天妬。生與女士。雖飄泊海角天涯。或當相見。以視死生契闊。則頂湖山高。或不及西湖水深也云云。圖前有于右任題簽。黄晦聞署額。并得費仲深諸貞壯劉三譚瓶齋王陸一姚茫父金息侯易大　江競安王秋齋潘蘭史黄賓虹柳亞子等題跋詩詞。益爲名貴。柳亞子</p>
<h3>防賊汽車　·履·冰</h3>
<p>英國有靑年發明家名費蘭洛者。備有汽車一輛。苟賊不自諒。欲圖行竊。祇須手指觸及車部。卽能自動發出怪聲。不啻明告路人以車之被竊。總之。費氏之車。卽手段高强之偷兒。亦無從下手也。</p>
<p>蘇格蘭法院。近將中有防賊設置之汽車。加以實騐。當時法院諸人均到。而費氏亦在塲。初由費氏發言。謂此車無異尋常。但能防免失竊。觀者不信。可試爲之。於是有某偵探近前。以極細心之動作。欲試開車門。不意略一撥動。怪聲大鳴。致使其驚而却步。尚有一偵探。自謂祇須將鐵線網上通入喇叭管之線條。完全割絶。卽可無慮。然車蓋旣啓、正欲施割線工作。而聲又讀發矣。上項發明。聞將用諸郵車之上。俾可得郵件寄遞時之安全云。</p>
<h3>世界小事記·海·客</h3>
<p>▲某年。德國浮德堡地方。舉行音樂會。入塲須出十馬克的代價。倘没有錢的。可以雞蛋兩枚爲代。因爲那時雞蛋奇缺之故。</p>
<p>▲倫敦有一個巡警。自一千八百七十五年開始服務。直到如今。還仍在職。歷時已五十多年。可謂世界唯一的老巡警。</p>
<p>▲英國有一位著名的醫士宣言。「人們常設工作過度。足以傷勢。其實没有這回事。致命之傷。在於多憂多慮。」</p>
<p>▲美國有一位女富豪遊歷歐洲。他的行李計有大箱子八十隻。從法京巴黎運往英國。進口時所付的稅銀。計一千金鎊之多。聞者都爲之咋舌。</p>
<p>▲英國密特爾山克司府伊爾華斯地方。有人在一所茅舍中發見蜂蜜二百四十磅。貯藏在房間的天花板中。像這樣多量的蜂蜜貯在一處。還是破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>▲英法美三國的軍事飛機。據一九二二年的調查、計英有三百七十八架。美有五百三十七架。法國最多。計有二千五百二十架。近數年來。三國又添造不少。英國飛行家輩出。更爲努力。</p>
<p>▲英國孟吉斯德城中。工廠極多。烟囱林立。所以煤烟亂飛。每年因煤烟所受的損失。約有一百萬金鎊之巨。</p>
<p>題詞。用吕碧城倫敦堡弔古韵摸魚兒調。纒綿悱惻。爲錄如下。憶南天湖山佳處。湘絃錦瑟曾奏。當時豈料輕離别。吟遍相思紅豆。天意驟。奈夢醒燈殘。難挽纖纖手。山盟海壽。記油壁同車。靑騘并轡。嬉戲値三九。風波急。可奈分飛時候。同心密約終負。蛾眉萬里投荒死。好夢難圓鶯脰。痕滿袖。畫一幅眞眞。可抵詩千首。柔情懺否。向何地埋憂。狂歌當哭。願作離騷胄。生亦有古風一章。迴腸盪氣。哀感頑艷。兼而有之。詩云。頂湖山。山色好。曾照佳人容窈窕。奈何今日喚眞眞。只餘一幅傷心稿。佳人本是大家女。錦瑟年華識經史。管領春風桃李多。鴛鴦繡出從君始。憶昔星岩携手遊。一丘一壑窮探搜。登臨每到最高處。塵寰下視空悠悠。空悠悠。雲水流。我走歇浦君南遊。迄鳥蠻花不足語。自誓拚老終炎州。太息塵緣何時了。忽看霜日芙蓉槁。檢點靑箱故物存。日事摩挲忘昏曉。摩挲摩挲哀怨多。别有幽懷喚奈何。鮫綃帕儘涙痕裹。中有心香歷不磨。衷衣贈到身心暖。一針一線量長短。長是恨。短是因緣天不管。吁嗟乎。情天缺。媧皇補。恨海深。精衞堵。獨余此恨永綿綿。只憑一紙訴心苦。心苦心苦余負汝。相期密約守終古。一往情深。不忍卒讀也。</p>
<h3>犬媒　陳叔平</h3>
<p>首都市上。横臥街頭之犬。觸目皆是。社會局雖曾一度取締。令犬主人赴局登記。領取銅牌。繫埀犬項。以示别於野犬。否則格殺不論。何如負責無人。搜捕不力。故殊鮮成效。加之蓄者多以爲犬有司戸之責。輙養諸門外。若輩遂據街頭爲臥榻。徒步者時有行不得也哥哥之概。其最甚者。若估衣廊一帶。竟有惡狗之村稱。阻礙交通。可見一斑。</p>
<p>去秋某夜。天氣隂霾。一截髮時裝少女。足登高跟革履。自戚家赴宴歸。因街頭適無車輛。祇得徒步而行。道出沐府西門。正蹀　間。忽足蹴一物。其軟如棉。該物受踏。突然躍起。高越女首。並發怪聲。女出不意。驚仆暈去。時文友淸和生適經其旁。目睹一切。急趨前扶女起。攙至附近餃麫肆。乞取開水。將女灌醒。詢問之下。始知女胡姓。金陵望族也。家居北門橋。生遂代爲僱車。伴送之歸。按女父現供職某機關。膝下僅此掌珠。珍愛逾恒。旣悉生拯女事。感激自不待言。翌日特設筵宴生。表示謝忱。酒半酣。暢談甚歡。生自述家設洋貨肆。曾卒業某中學。現執教鞭於某校。因一時尚乏合意情侣。故中匱猶虛。言下頗露求凰之意。女父雖口頭未允。心中固已默許。數日後。經生央媒往返說合。良緣遂締。日前假座某大旅社舉行結婚禮。席間來賓强新郎自述其情史。生堅辭。後由張君代述。結句云。二人結合。可謂係犬之媒。乾坤兩宅介紹人聞之。爲之忸怩不止。可謂趣矣。</p>
<h3>聲片的新趨向　苗子</h3>
<p>有一個問題。可以給電影嗜好者以新的考慮、這便是「有聲片與無聲片究竟何者爲美。」</p>
<p>許多人都反對有聲影片。以爲無聲影片有一種「無言之美。」銀幕上的動作。實在不必要有聲音去配合它。滑稽大王卓别麟曾經說。「有聲影片的産生。是電影藝術失敗的開始。」</p>
<p>也有許多人贊美有聲影片。以爲有聲影片的確是電影事業的特殊的進步。那繁複的代替着單調的。那具體的代替着抽象的。情感因爲有聲音而更覺和諸、動作因爲有聲音而更覺親切、一切的一切。都顯呈出絶對的自然化。不像無聲影片那樣。終使人感覺到一種空虛。</p>
<p>現在。不需要我來解釋。究竟是那一種論調是對的。不過我們知道。所謂所聲影片。不是和無聲影片處於對立的地位的。它的主體。正和無聲影片一樣。仍在於影片的情節。聲音原不過是它的附屬品而已。最近美國電影評論雜誌上刋載麥倫博士一文。很能說明這一層意思。他說「舞台劇終是舞台勮。影片終是影片。倘使美國的電影公司放棄了他們以前的無聲影片的好處。而要把舞台劇和歌舞之類作爲新的有聲片的中心材料者。那是有聲影片必致失敗了。要在我們所要求的。乃是攝製聲片者。不要把「聲」作爲他第一個對象。那曲折的情節和深切的表情。仍然是有聲影片所必須有的條、而「聲音」僅僅是要使那些情節和表演添加它們的力量而已。</p>
<p>現在。花蘭塢的電影界。也感覺到這一層了。所以一九三一年的有聲片。顯然已和一九二九年的大不相同。所謂完全歌舞的有聲片。已經不多見。而聯藝公司。竟打算把賴婚一片改攝爲新的有聲片了。於此。可見新的有聲片。已經得到了新的覺悟。而在銀藝的領域中。不致被歌舞的舞台劇潮衝破了原有的堅固的壁壘。</p>
<p>最近有聲片的力量。已經使全世界的電影界一致推崇。除了英國已經得偉大的成功外。日本也有十張以上的有聲片。便在我國。雖然還没有正式的有聲片的映演。但在許多電影觀衆的熱望裏。大家已經知道有一張胡蝶女士主演的「歌女紅牡丹」將次開映。</p>
<p>「歌女紅牡丹」。是完全有聲的。但它並不曾埋没無聲片的長處。雖然片中也有很多的歌舞。但它的全片的靈魂。没有被歌舞奪去。它有很曲折的情節。描寫着一個歌女的命運。充滿着時代的呼聲。它有很美麗的表演。描寫一個劇塲内外的背景。暴露出社會的慘酷。這自然是我國有聲片的大成功了。（未蓋章）</p>

<h3>State Council Issues Mandate to Honor Deceased Division Commander Zhang</h3>
<p>Hunan Compatriots Prepare Memorial Service</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The State Council issued an order on the 23rd stating: Zhang Huizan, Commander of the 18th Division of the Army and member of the Hunan Provincial Government, was determined to quell national crises and had a long military career. He galloped across the Lingnan region, never shying away from hardship. During the Northern Expedition, he fought in various southeastern provinces, repeatedly making meritorious contributions. The government recognized his courage and strategic acumen and deeply relied on him. Recently, he was stationed in Jiangxi to suppress bandits, making thorough plans for pacification. He was deeply concerned for the people, penetrating deep to eliminate the bandits. Cut off from reinforcements, and with his troops outnumbered, he ultimately sacrificed his life. The reported circumstances of his death were tragic and heroic, comparable to Changshan and Suiyang. Upon hearing of this, we shed tears and deeply mourn him. Zhang Huizan is to be commemorated with preferential treatment as a fallen general in the army, per directive of the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Military Administration, and allowed a public funeral to commend his heroism and encourage loyalty.

<p>(Nanjing) In addition to the principles decided by the Central Political Council regarding the strategy for negotiations with Russia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also formulated a concrete plan to be carried by Mo De specifically to the Russian capital for negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Regarding the resumption of diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union must earnestly fulfill the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement, guaranteeing not to propagate communism in China and not to engage in subversive activities, with no other demands. Regarding commercial matters, our side advocates for equality as the principle, with mutual recognition of tariff autonomy and payment of taxes for trade through legitimate channels to restore commercial relations.

<h3>Control Yuan Supervisory Committee Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>Control Yuan Is Purely an Impeachment Body</p>
<p>Disciplinary Power Belongs to the Judicial Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan Supervisory Committee held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd. Eighteen people, including Liu San, attended, chaired by Yu Youren. The content concerned the internal matters of the committee, such as meeting rules and operating procedures. Five supervisors had not yet arrived in the capital. Zhu Guanglan and Yuan Jinkai were delayed due to disaster relief work. Zhu telegraphed his resignation, but Yu Youren urged him to take office. The Mongolian committee member Qi Zijun and others have already set out. The Guangdong committee member Ye Quan telegraphed from Peiping to resign, but Yu Youren persuaded him to come. The supervisors will be stationed in Nanjing permanently. Vice President Chen Guofu's illness has not yet healed, and it is difficult to take leave temporarily. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A member of the Control Yuan said that the Control Yuan Committee is different from the Legislative Yuan. There are no regulations for weekly meetings, nor are there meeting regulations in the organizational law. All supervisors have the power of impeachment, and the people can also file direct complaints, which the president will hand over to a committee of three or more members for review. If confirmed, it will be sent for disciplinary action without the need for a full committee vote. According to the Control Yuan's organizational law, supervisors only have the power of impeachment. As for the discipline of officials, it belongs to the Judicial Yuan's Committee on Disciplinary Measures for Officials. The Judicial Yuan believes that since the Control Yuan has been established, the Committee on Disciplinary Measures for Officials should be formed immediately to provide a disciplinary mechanism for impeached officials. The organizational law for the committee has been drafted and, after another review, will be sent to the State Council for submission to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Control Yuan has received more than ten cases of complaints, but many procedures are not in compliance. Cases that can be established will be handed over to the committee members for review. People who accuse officials must have evidence. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A supervisor said that administrative appeals are different from administrative lawsuits. Administrative lawsuits can be filed with the Control Yuan, or supervisors can file impeachments. The Control Yuan is purely an impeachment body. Rumors that the Control Yuan is requesting amendments to the organizational law because it does not have disciplinary powers are untrue. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Split of British Political Parties</h3>
<p>The ancients said, "After a long separation, there is a secret union; after a long union, there is inevitably separation." However, based on the experience of human affairs, it is easier to move from union to separation,</p>
<p>and more difficult to move from separation to union. This is because people's minds differ, and many believe they are right. Those with knowledge, talent, and power will never condescend to accommodate others. British politics has long been known to the world for its two major parties. Since the Labour Party was born in response to the times and stood outside the Conservative and Liberal parties, forming a tripartite balance, the Liberal Party again split internally, resulting in a reduction of its influence. The Conservative Party and the Labour Party then took turns in power. The so-called Liberal Party has become a party of weight and influence outside the two major parties. Therefore, as it stands now, the political strength of British political parties remains a two-party system.</p>
<p>Now it is heard that the Conservative Party has been split by Lords Rothermere and Beaverbrook, the newspaper magnates of the Imperial faction. Also, due to disagreements between Churchill, an important member of the party, and Baldwin, the party leader, on the India issue, the party is not consulted. The split of the Conservative Party is inevitable. As for the Labour Party, there are also internal inconsistencies. Mosley, who formerly served in the cabinet, will leave the party to form a National Socialist Party because his unemployment relief policy was not adopted, and his split is also unavoidable. The politics of the two major parties in Britain will each split into countless small parties, like the politics of France and Germany in Europe. Although national character is said to be permanent, it cannot be without change. This can be seen from this.</p>

<h3>Internal Factional Splits in the Three Major British Political Parties</h3>
<p>Political Status Gradually Becoming Complex</p>
<p>The Liberal Party, Merely Situated Between the Two Major Parties, Plays a Decisive Role</p>
<p>The Conservative Party, Due to Imperialist Policies, Has Suffered a Split; Mosley's Plan Fails to Sell; He Will Leave the Labour Party and Establish a New Party</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 22nd – Internal factional splits within British political parties have caused British politics to gradually become complex. The Liberal Party, once a major party, is now in decline and unable to automatically achieve anything. Its only power lies in playing a decisive role between the government and opposition parties on important issues. The Conservative Party has been broken by the press tycoons of the imperialist faction. Lords Beaverbrook and Rothermere continue to promote their imperial crusade policy through their newspapers, and their candidates oppose the official Conservative candidates in by-elections everywhere. As a result, the votes that Conservative candidates could obtain are divided, and there is no prospect of success. At the same time, Winston Churchill, an important figure in the Conservative Party, has disagreed with party leader Stanley Baldwin on the Indian issue and has now ceased to be involved in party affairs. As for the Labour Party, there are also signs of division. Oswald Mosley, who previously served in the cabinet but resigned resolutely due to the failure of his unemployment policy to be adopted, is now said to be leading his comrades to leave the Labour Party. It is reported that Mosley will publish a pamphlet this week, stating the differences between his policies and those of the Labour cabinet. He will then conduct large-scale propaganda in various industrial areas. At that time, the Labour Party may consider his actions to involve party discipline, but it is expected that Mosley and others will leave the party first to avoid the Labour Party's punishment. Mosley originally proposed reorganizing the temporary emergency five-member cabinet, implementing a national plan, and establishing agencies to develop new industries and revitalize existing industries. He also advocated establishing a food import and goods import administration, and simultaneously concluding commercial treaties with overseas autonomous territories, while adopting wartime munitions manufacturing regulations domestically to establish public housing construction agencies. Mosley criticized the Conservative Party's tariff proposals as moves to protect the inefficient, but also admitted that tariffs are more convenient than licenses for the purpose of the goods import administration's operation. Mosley married the daughter of the late Marquess Curzon and was originally a strongman of the Conservative Party, but later he and his wife switched to the Labour Party. However, Cabinet Minister Morrison criticized his unemployment policy, saying that this person is arrogant and belongs to the Labour Party newcomer, and that there is still some true Conservative blood in his veins. Recently, according to Mosley's friends, Mosley will resign from the Labour Party and form his own party, called the National Socialist Party. About fifteen members of Parliament will cooperate with him. It is rumored that when the National Labour Party Executive Committee meets this Wednesday, Mosley will declare his withdrawal from the party and notify party leader MacDonald in writing.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Bombay, 22nd – Police today arrested 400 National Congress volunteers who gathered in the city center to salute the Indian national flag, including the president and members of the so-called Struggle Executive Council.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Ahmedabad, 23rd – "The boycott of foreign cloth has become the biggest problem in India today," said Gandhi recently in an article published in his weekly. Gandhi advised factory owners to exchange foreign cloth for cloth woven in their own factories with Indian merchants. This foreign cloth can be sold abroad, burned, or kept until the goal of autonomy has been achieved, at which point the new government can be requested to compensate for any losses incurred.</p>
<h3>Major Storm in the Mediterranean</h3>

<h3>Weapons of War Progress a Thousand Miles a Day</h3>
<p>Machine Guns Installed on Airplanes</p>
<p>Level Flight at 200 Miles Per Hour</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 23rd – The British Royal Air Force has completed the testing of a new type of fighter plane at its test site. This plane has only one pilot and is equipped with six machine guns. Two of the guns fire simultaneously from the propeller, and the rest are arranged on the wings and can be opened and closed freely. This plane has a level flight speed of about 200 miles per hour, but if it descends from a high altitude, its speed can reach 320 miles per hour. It takes nine minutes to climb to an altitude of 15,000 feet, and its maximum altitude is 26,000 feet, or about five miles. However, the air is thin at high altitudes, so this plane must carry oxygen for the driver's use.</p>

<h3>Commemoration Week for the Central Government and the National Government</h3>
<p>▲Wu Zhihui Reports on Promoting the Gregorian Calendar</p>
<p>▲Yu Youren Speaks on County Magistrates and Ideologies</p>
<p>▲Central Party Headquarters On the 23rd, at 9 a.m., the Central Party Headquarters held the 100th Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Li Shizeng, Wu Jingheng, Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, Miao Peicheng, Zhu Jiahua, Ma Chaojun, Zhang Qun, and more than 500 staff and guests attended. Sun Ke presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Wu Jingheng reported, stating that today is February 23rd, and on this day in 1924, Dr. Sun Yat-sen gave a speech, saying that the most important revolutionary method now is the struggle of language and writing, because it has been thirteen years since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, and the revolution has not yet been completed, which is due to the incompleteness of the revolutionary methods. I think there are two kinds of struggles, one is propaganda struggle, and the other is gun and cannon struggle. The results obtained by the latter are not as easy to maintain and thorough as the former. Military strategy says that attacking the city is inferior, and attacking the heart is superior. Propaganda is the policy of attacking the heart. The so-called propaganda does not only mean relying on the tongue, but must have an extremely sincere will and attitude, guide the situation, popularize the masses, and make them sincerely convinced, which is always beneficial. Taking the abolition of the lunar calendar as an example, today is the seventh day of the first lunar month. Most people think that today is Renri, and this concept is deeply imprinted in their minds and unbreakable. For example, Beijing decorated very lively in the year of abolishing the lunar calendar, and the Shanghai Concession also did not forget its accumulated habits. If the government uses power to prohibit this kind of scene, it will be difficult to achieve results. Only by using the two words "sincerity" shown by Dr. Sun Yat-sen can they understand and realize. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that the most important method of touching people is the word "sincerity." As for the solar calendar and the lunar calendar, they are nothing more than trying to be convenient. Some say that the lunar calendar is not only convenient for habits, but also has patriotism, because the lunar calendar is Chinese, and the solar calendar is foreign. This statement is worth discussing. The lunar calendar is the Xia calendar. Before Xia Yu, it was the era of Yao and Shun. After Xia Yu, it was the era of Shang and Zhou. It was not the lunar calendar. It can be seen that the solar calendar was originally inherent in ancient China. Later, the reason for determining the Xia calendar was actually because Confucius had the phrase "practice the time of Xia." The meaning of Confucius's determination to practice the time of Xia at that time was also related to the four seasons, all of which were determined by agricultural weather. The lunar calendar's intercalary months and solar terms are not as accurate as the solar calendar. The solar calendar can be divided into solar terms and is more accurate than the lunar calendar. When Confucius calculated the calendar, it was not as accurate as it is today, so Confucius advocated practicing the time of Xia. If it were today, he might not say that again. The lunar calendar has various inconveniences, such as the East-West half-split method for intercalary months, which is an inconvenience of the lunar calendar. As for settling accounts on the three festivals, it does not necessarily have to be the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the end of the year. It is not impossible to set another appropriate time. Now I occasionally recall the story of Kang Youwei. I will not discuss Kang's personality. When Kang advocated cutting hair and changing clothes, a vegetable worker scolded, saying that the pigtail was left by the ancestors, and cutting hair is forgetting the ancestors. He was out of patriotism at the time, but he did not know that the Qing soldiers entered the customs and slaughtered many ancestors' ancestors for shaving their heads. So the solar calendar is also said to be Chinese. Before Xia Yu, it was probably also the solar calendar. Speaking of the problem of settling accounts, I personally think that the three solar terms of spring equinox, summer solstice, and autumn equinox can be divided into accounting periods. The beginning of spring and the lunar New Year are only a few days apart. The summer solstice and autumn equinox are very close to the Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival. They not only conform to agricultural time but are also convenient for commercial habits. For example, the Ministry of Education has designated May 5th of the solar calendar as the Dragon Boat Festival. Although the Dragon Boat Festival can be moved according to the lunar calendar, the silkworms have not yet matured, and it is inconvenient to settle accounts. The Ministry of Education has not yet paid attention to agricultural affairs. The solar calendar's beginning of spring is always in February, the summer solstice is always in June, and the autumn equinox is always in September, all of which are after the harvest of agricultural affairs, so it is appropriate to use this time as the collection period, which is suitable for the solar terms and convenient for agricultural affairs. The people may be sincerely convinced of this. Now the Shanghai business community plans to use the end of February, the end of June, and the end of October as the three accounting periods, which is also an improvement method. As for festivals, wine, food, and entertainment, it depends on the person and changes with the times. Habits become natural, so it is not necessarily limited to the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the lunar New Year. It is not impossible to move it to the beginning of spring, summer solstice, autumn equinox, and the solar New Year, drinking wine, eating meat, comforting, and enjoying. As for ancestor worship on the three festivals, it also shows our filial piety. The date is not fixed. Since the three festivals have been changed, the ancestor worship period should also be changed. Sending off the Kitchen God on the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month also has a kind of significance, that is, a thorough cleaning is carried out at the end of each year. Cleanliness is an element of hygiene, which is not limited to the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month. Various old superstitions should be eliminated as much as possible, and drinking and making music can arouse the concept of improvement in habits. Those who are engaged in propaganda work should pay more attention, strive bravely, and take on the responsibility of changing customs. After the speech, the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>▲National Government At 10 a.m. on the same day, the National Government held the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Yu Youren, Shi Ren, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wang Zhengting, Ma Fuxiang, He Yaozu, Liu Ruiheng, Niu Yongjian, and more than 300 staff members from the Literature and Participation Departments of the National Government attended. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the meeting. Yu Youren gave a speech entitled "County Magistrate and Ideology," the main idea of which was that he went to Shaanxi last year to investigate the disaster and passed through Jingyang County. The villagers and the academic community in the county town all said that the county magistrate Shao Hongji was extremely honest in handling county affairs, bandits disappeared in the territory, and residents lived in peace. He was really a rare county magistrate, so Shao Jun was specially included in the selection of supervisors. Recently, friends told me that there are also many good county magistrates like this in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, so the quality of the county magistrate has a profound and significant relationship with a county. What I hope for officials all over the country is the first, the officials under the National Government are the officials under the Three Principles of the People, and they should understand the party's righteousness. The second, officials should take the Three Principles of the People as the basis for moral cultivation. The third, they should know that since the Three Principles of the People have been produced, they are invincible. Officials should go to it with a spirit of fearlessness and sincerity. I also hope that the provinces will be more cautious when selecting and appointing county magistrates. In this way, the work of political tutelage will be easy to proceed. After the speech, music was played and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Committee Members and Ministers of Four Agencies Sworn In</h3>
<p>▲Supervisory Committee Members of the Control Yuan, Members of the Opium Prohibition Committee</p>
<p>▲Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Liu San, Liu Chengyu, Gao Yihan, Zhou Lisheng, Yu Hongqi, Zhou Jue, Xiao Xuan, Wu Zhongxin, Xie Wuliang, Zheng Luosheng, Yao Yuping, Liu Eqing, Gao You Tang, Li Menggeng, Wang Pingzheng, Shao Hongji, Tian Jinjiong, Luo Jiefu, Yang Pusheng (Secretary-General) supervisory committee members of the Control Yuan; Li Jihong, Chen Shaokuan, Luo Yunyan, Zhong Ketuo, Hu Yuwei, Chen Bingguang, Zhang Shusheng, Tian Xiongfei, Shi Zanming, committee members of the Opium Prohibition Committee; Chen Yi (Political Vice Minister), Cao Haosen (Permanent Vice Minister) of the Ministry of Military Affairs; Zheng Hongnian (Vice Minister) of the Ministry of Industry; Zhu Kongyang (Director) and Du Chen (Deputy Director) of the Military Supplies Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs held the oath-taking ceremony after the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week of the National Government on the 23rd. Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Wang Zhengting, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Chonghui, etc. attended. Chairman Chiang presided over the ceremony, and then the oath-taking ceremony was held. Central Committee member Wang Chongxian presided over the oath-taking. Each person taking the oath raised his right hand to take the oath. After the oath, Wang Chonghui, who presided over the oath-taking, delivered a speech, stating briefly that now is the period of political tutelage, and all construction is nothing more than promoting benefits and eliminating harms. Although the agencies served by all of you are different, promoting benefits and eliminating harms are the same. The task of the supervisory committee members is to eliminate the harm of corrupt officials, and the task of the Opium Prohibition Committee is to eliminate the harm of bad social habits. The task of the Ministry of Military Affairs is to eliminate internal bandits and external troubles. All bad habits are easy to grow, and good habits are not easy to cultivate. I hope that after you take office, you will follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, eliminate all harms, and build a good country. Also, since China has traded with foreign countries, it has suffered greatly from foreign economic oppression. The remedy cannot be done with empty words. Therefore, the Fourth Plenary Session decided to establish the Ministry of Industry, so that domestic products are sufficient to supply the needs of the Chinese people, which is also to eliminate the harm of foreign merchant oppression. I hope all comrades will work hard to do it. Chairman Chiang's speech stated briefly that with the supervisory committee members taking office and the establishment of the Control Yuan, the five-power constitution is complete. In the future, various active tasks will be done by each court in division of labor and cooperation. As for passive work, that is, eradicating corrupt officials and bad social habits, the revolution will also succeed. I hope that all comrades will do it with the four words of integrity and honesty. The staff of the Military Department and the Industry Department are also no exception to these four words. In short, civil officials should not be corrupt, and military officers should not be afraid of death, so as to fulfill their duties. Liu Chengyu, the representative of the supervisory committee members, replied briefly, saying that he would respectfully accept the instructions of the central representatives and the chairman of the National Government, and use the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the governance rights granted by the National Government to eliminate the harm to the people. Zhong Ketuo, the representative of the Opium Prohibition Committee, replied briefly, saying that opium has been a poison for a hundred years, and now there are various narcotics that seriously endanger the people. Our party adheres to the policy of prohibition and plans methods to implement prohibition, which is a matter of urgency. In the future, we will follow the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the central instructions and work hard to ensure that there is no more black poison under the blue and white flag. Chen Yi, the political vice minister of the Military Department, replied briefly, saying that he would respectfully accept the instructions of the central representatives and work hard under the leadership of the chairman and minister. Zheng Hongnian, the vice minister of the Ministry of Industry, replied briefly, saying that he would work hard to revitalize industry in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and central instructions.</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>▲Continued Efforts in Russia in the Future</p>
<p>Mo Dehui, the plenipotentiary representative of the Sino-Soviet Conference, has been in Beijing for many days. Since the central government's policy towards Russia has been decided, he has been ordered to go to Russia to continue negotiations. It has been decided that he will take the train to Harbin tomorrow (24th) at 7 p.m. and will go to Moscow around the middle of next month. Mr. Mo hosted a banquet for the press at the International Friendship Association today (23rd) at 12 noon. Liu Luyin, Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee, Ke Xinge, a member of the Central Committee, and more than 80 reporters from various newspapers in Beijing, Ping, Shanghai, and Wuhan attended. Mo Dehui stood up and delivered a speech, stating briefly that he was very honored that all of you gentlemen were able to attend today and gather together. Last spring, I was ordered to go to Russia, and before I left, I was encouraged by all of you, which I still admire. This time, I returned to Beijing to report on the progress of the meeting and ask for strategies. I have visited the chairman many times and met with the presidents and ministers of various courts many times. The central government has decided on the meeting strategy and ordered me to continue the negotiations. Looking back at the history of Sino-Soviet relations for the past ten years, initially, the Soviet Union's declarations to China in 1919 and 1920 won the sympathy of the people of our country, and the Sino-Russian Feng-E Agreement was concluded in 1924. Later, because the provisions of the agreement could not be fully realized, misunderstandings arose, which was a pity. The issues to be discussed at the Sino-Soviet Conference this time are all within the scope of the Sino-Russian and Feng-E agreements. As long as the Soviet side respects the spirit of its repeated declarations, the meeting will proceed smoothly. During my eight months in the Soviet Union, I have repeatedly explained to the people of the country, arousing the attention of the Soviet Union. This time I return to my post, I should follow the central government's intentions, do my best, and continue to work hard to achieve my initial intentions, so as to live up to the expectations of the people. I plan to leave Beijing for Harbin tomorrow and take some time off before going to Russia. I still hope that you will not abandon me and guide me at any time to correct my shortcomings. I would like to raise a glass to wish you all good health. After Mr. Mo finished his speech, the press unanimously elected Lai Lian, editor-in-chief of the Central Daily News, to deliver a reply, stating briefly that he was deeply grateful that Mr. Mo hosted a banquet for the press today. Our country is now building a new country with the Three Principles of the People. In this construction process, there are many difficult problems, especially foreign affairs problems. Dr. Sun Yat-sen taught us that our country has become a semi-colony and must abolish all unequal treaties to restore our freedom and equality. However, now most people say that weak countries have no diplomacy. However, according to the facts, weak countries do not have no diplomacy. For example, Turkey in the East, which was previously regarded by various countries as the sick man of the East, until its revolution succeeded, ordinary people thought that it was promoted by the military force of General Fevzi Çakmak. It is unknown that the Turkish Foreign Minister Esat Mouhtar at that time was engaged in international cooperation in the League of Nations with various great powers, and abolished all unequal treaties, placing Turkey in an equal position. Diplomacy has contributed a lot, so the saying that weak countries have no diplomacy is not true. Now our country's foreign affairs problems are very difficult, especially foreign affairs with Russia, because Russia has the organization of the Third International and the Communist Party, and its diplomatic skills are very cunning. However, Mr. Mo has been working in Russia for foreign affairs in the past year. Although the domestic disputes were fierce at the time, he was still able to uphold the central government's intentions and strive for Russia. This spirit is admirable. This time, he will go to Russia again to continue negotiations and will be able to work hard and achieve the final victory. This is not only expected by the people of the press, but also expected by the people of the whole country. Now, I respectfully offer Mr. Mo a glass, wishing Mr. Mo a safe arrival in Russia and obtaining the final victory in diplomacy. During the banquet, the music was melodious, and the guests and hosts were happy. The photo was taken at 2:30 p.m. and dispersed.</p>
<h3>General Summary of the Business Community in Wuhu</h3>
<p>▲The Situation of Abolishing the New Year is Very Different from the Past</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence Since the abolition of the old lunar calendar was vigorously implemented last year, the business community has still been unable to implement the conclusion of accounts on the national New Year due to accumulated habits. Later, after repeated requests, the deadline for the general conclusion was extended to February 16, which is still at the end of the lunar calendar. However, the situation is very different from the past. The sound of firecrackers is heard only occasionally. Most of the stores are still closed for three days, but now they have completely resumed business. After the summary of each industry, the Qian industry has more surpluses due to the slightly active rice market. However, because of the rain and snow before the conclusion period, the accounts were greatly affected, so it was not as prosperous as in previous years. In other cloth and miscellaneous industries, initially, due to the conclusion of accounts on the national New Year, the silver roots were tight, and they did not dare to let go of purchases. The business in the townships was even more affected. Except for a few retail stores with better conditions, the rest were also greatly affected by the rain and snow, and the accounts were particularly large, with almost no surplus to speak of. The only hope of the merchants in the future is that the banditry in various places can be cleared up as soon as possible, the rice market can be maintained, and the industries will have a turnaround. The detailed investigation of the surplus of the Qian industry is as follows: Qingkang 15,000 taels, Yuankang 32,000 taels, Jiuyu 38,000 taels, Dakang 5,000 taels, Tongyu 10,000 taels, Chengda 5,000 taels, Xihetai 10,000 taels, Xingkang 9,000 taels, Junhe 5,000 taels, Qinyi 5,000 taels, Shunkang 7,000 taels, Tongfa 5,000 taels, Lisheng 7,500 taels, Chengyu 20,000 taels, Dayuan 25,000 taels, Xingda 40,000 taels, Shoukang 5,000 taels, Tonghe 20,000 taels, Shengchang 5,000 taels, Houfeng 10,000 taels, Hengmao 35,000 taels, Nanhe 10,000 taels (21st)</p>

<p>The Security Regiment Captured Another Important Bandit The Bandit Disaster in Punan Zhang Previously, Bai Jizhi, the battalion commander of the first battalion of the second regiment of the Songjiang Security Team stationed in Songjiang, searched the bandit den in Liu Jiayan Bridge and arrested the female bandits Gu Abao Chen Shen Bao three people, and escorted them to the regiment headquarters for interrogation. They claimed to be village women who were kidnapped by bandits, but those who knew them said that the three female bandits were indeed the family members of the bandit leader. Until the day before yesterday, Battalion Commander Bai again seized the bandits Cheng Xueyuan and Xu Decai in Qianjiawei, and rescued a hostage, Fan Chengguan, and escorted them to Songjiang. Cao Pang, the regiment commander, personally interrogated them. At first, they denied the charges, but then the female bandits were brought out for identification. Cheng and Xu admitted that they were indeed members of the bandit gang. Cheng and others, seeing that they could not deny it, admitted that they had followed a large gang to kidnap eight members of the Shen Youche and Shen Xibin families, and that they had released three shop assistants and apprentices afterwards. Xu admitted to rowing the boat and guarding the tickets. They also pointed out that Gu Abao was the concubine of Taibao Ashu, Li Chen was the wife of Taibao Ashu, and Shen Bao was the wife of Taibao Ashu's brother Afu. When questioned, the female bandits also pleaded guilty. After the interrogation, they were ordered to be recorded and sent to the prison for verification. As for Fan Chengguan, the hostage who was rescued, he was from Sili, Pinghu, and the regiment headquarters has sent a letter to his family to collect him. Cao Pang, the regiment commander, considered that the bandit forces in Punan were rampant, so he personally led the team to the countryside on the 22nd to search and arrest them. It is heard that a bandit scout, A-Mei, was arrested yesterday. He confessed clearly and there is talk of executing him on the spot. Commander Cao has recently been appointed by Commander-in-Chief Chiang as the Songjiang-Shanghai Appeasement Zone Commander, and he will leave for his post and will hold the inauguration ceremony in early March.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Please Abolish the Railway Traffic Surtax The County Chamber of Commerce, considering that the railway passenger tickets of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway carry a traffic surtax, which places a heavy burden on passengers, has drafted a proposal to be submitted for discussion at the National Chamber of Commerce Conference to be held in Shanghai on March 1st, and then forwarded to the relevant department for prompt abolition in order to alleviate the burden on passengers. It is reported that the Longtan Chamber of Commerce also has a similar request.</p>
<p>Shen Guanding's Letter of Guarantee for Gao Liao Shi Former San Francisco Deputy Consul Gao Ying and his wife Liao Qinqiu were escorted back to China due to a case involving the trafficking of opium. After the second instance judgment of the High Court, they appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled that Sun Yuan and Gao Ying should be sent back to the High Court for retrial. Gao Liao Shi's third instance trial has concluded, and she was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and a fine of four thousand yuan. Gao Liao Shi's health has been weak, and her condition has deteriorated since being detained. She suffers from severe hemoptysis, which has worsened since the beginning of spring. Although prison doctor Ruan Jiemin and Bo Xi Hospital's Kuang Xun were invited for diagnosis and treatment, her condition has not improved. Therefore, her brother-in-law Shen Guanding was informed by letter, requesting him to find a guarantor for her to seek medical treatment outside. Yesterday (the 23rd), Shen Guanting specially requested the High Court to allow her to be released on bail for medical treatment to save her life, but it is unknown how the High Court will handle this matter.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Defamation Yesterday's Court Hearing Zhou Jingxiao, a native of the county, is a reporter for the Xin Wuxi Daily. His wife, Ms. Zhang Shouying, suffered from liver and stomach qi disorder. The director of Hou Sheng Hospital, Tao Chishun, injected her right arm vein with an ovarian preparation called Ar Ar Fur Ming, which caused the needle to touch the uremic poison and enter the bloodstream. Ms. Zhang died tragically at noon on the 26th of last month. Tao Chishun, realizing the seriousness of the matter, fled to Shanghai. Tao Chishun's father, Tao Yanfang, made a preemptive move and sued Zhou Jingxiao in the county court for defamation and trespassing. Zhou Jingxiao also entrusted lawyers An Ruotai and Yang Shi to draft a counterclaim against Tao Chishun for negligence and manslaughter. Yesterday (the 23rd) was the date for the court hearing of Tao's suit against Zhou. The court ordered bailiffs to summon the plaintiff Tao Chishun and Tao Tingfang, and the defendant Zhou Jingxiao to court. At 2 p.m., the hearing was opened by Prosecutor Xuan. On the plaintiff's side were Tao Tingfang and Tao Chishun, and defense lawyer Hu Jiayu. On the defendant's side was Zhou Jingxiao, and defense lawyer An Ruotai. Prosecutor Xuan first questioned Tao Tingfang and Tao Chishun, then Zhou Jingxiao. After arguments from both sides' lawyers, Prosecutor Xuan stated that this case was related to Zhou Jingxiao's accusation against Tao Chishun for negligence and manslaughter, and that the case should be investigated by the investigative court before a decision could be made. The court ordered the case to be temporarily suspended. Both parties agreed and left the court.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Dredging of the Meng River Petitioning the Provincial Government The Wuyi Dredging of the Meng River Committee, considering that the construction was currently underway with water diversion, but continuous rain and snow had caused the river water to overflow and the tidal waves to surge, resulting in the suspension of all projects. However, a contract had been signed with the contractor, and it was difficult to guarantee that the spring floods would not arrive. After deliberation, a proper solution was needed, and the project involved a huge sum of 200,000 yuan, so remedial measures had to be planned early. Wu Jiguang, Shao Shantao, and Xie Jun were appointed to carry the report to the provincial government on the 23rd to meet with Sun Hongzhe, the Director of the Construction Department, to request that personnel be sent to conduct on-site surveys and provide prompt remedial measures.</p>

<p>Record of an Unusual Fireball Found on the Roof During the end of the old calendar year, the news of a fireball discovered on the roof of the Chen family in the West Street of Nanqiao was widely circulated, and everyone was talking about it. The reporter initially did not believe it, but after inquiring with the homeowner, Mr. Chen Quansheng, he learned that it was true. According to him, the time of discovery was around dusk. The light was red and large, resembling a sun spinning in the air, with intense flames. However, its position always remained on the left and right sides of the ridge. At the time, some curious people thought it was a gas fireball released by neighboring children, and they went up to the roof to investigate, but found nothing. The matter is strange and recorded here for posterity.</p>
<p>Petition to Maintain the Original Land Survey Plan The county government of this county has organized a land survey led by the county land bureau. The county government has submitted various measures to the provincial government some time ago, which stated that the special land survey surtax of 300 cash per mu proposed by the county is too high and should follow the general practice of other counties, allowing only 100 cash per mu. As for the land surveying personnel, they should be arranged by the provincial land bureau when the survey begins. It is now learned that the county government has submitted the case to the current county government for reconsideration. As a result, the county government still insists on maintaining the original plan and has submitted a petition today stating the reasons and requesting instructions to comply.</p>

<p>Expansion of the Shifang Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Farm in Gaoqiao The Shifang Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Farm in Gaoqiao North purchased land in Gaozi Town last year and planted mulberry trees extensively, using new methods for irrigation and cultivation. They have now grown into lush forests. The silkworm seeds produced in the spring can already be used for raising silkworms. In order to expand the farm's operations, they have recently purchased 30 mu of land outside the New West Gate to build the newest silkworm rearing rooms using scientific methods. They are currently actively carrying out the work and expect it to be completed in April. In the future, the products will be even better. Since the farm announced the planned method for producing silkworm seeds, requests for registration have been pouring in from various ports far and near, which is a good sign for the silkworm industry.</p>

<p>Lawsuit for Luring and Escaping Hang Qi, the owner of a firecracker shop in West Gate Street in this city, has an elderly mother, wife, and younger sister. In October of last year, his sister was suddenly lured away by a neighbor named Cao, and they both escaped. Hang immediately negotiated with Cao's sister, but Cao's sister denied it and filed a lawsuit with the court, accusing Hang of intimidation and fraud. The case was investigated once by the prosecutor's office of the county court, and the court ordered further investigation before summoning the parties again. Recently, Hang suddenly received a secret report from a neighbor stating that Cao and his sister were living together in the Yudai Alley. Yesterday, Hang filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting that Cao's siblings and Hang's sister be summoned to court for investigation.</p>
<p>Request for Instructions on Landlord-Tenant Disputes County Magistrate Chen Nanxuan stated that the lease contracts (i.e., receipts) between tenants and landlords all clearly stated the amount of rent to be paid, and disputes often arise during lean years when the government has no basis for making fair and legal judgments. Therefore, he has specially submitted a request to the Civil Affairs Department for instructions.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3>Letter from the Pinghu Maoba Hospital</h3>
<p>Having recently read the news in your newspaper on February 20th about the Pinghu Hospital being vandalized and demanding money, it does not correspond to the facts. On the morning of the 16th of this month, a soldier from the local security department came to our hospital for treatment. Due to a misunderstanding caused by a language barrier, there was a minor argument. After clarification, he was treated and left. The so-called vandalism of the hospital, assault on the dean, and destruction of the sedan chair are all untrue. We respectfully request a correction to reflect the truth. Respectfully, Pinghu Maoba Hospital, February 21st.</p>

<h3>The Experts' Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society in Suzhou (II)</h3>
<p>The proceedings of the experts' meeting held by the China Vocational Education Society in Suzhou have been compiled and reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, the program for the second day's meeting and tour has been slightly changed from the original plan, as described below:</p>
<p>▲Details of the Second Day</p>
<p>At 7:30 a.m. on the 22nd, the participants boarded a boat from the back gate of the Garden Hotel. Chairman Liu Zhanen opened the meeting and reported that each participant would first present their opinions, limited to three minutes. A fine would be imposed for exceeding the time limit. The boat passed through Qi Shi Street and landed to visit the Provincial Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Factory, where breakfast was served. At 10:00 a.m., the participants passed through Muzhi Town and visited the People's Education Center, and toured the Yan Garden. Due to time constraints, they did not visit the Lingyan Mountain scenic spot, which is two or three miles from the town. They disembarked for lunch, which was provided by the Shijia Restaurant in the town. At a little after 1:00 p.m., they arrived at the Guangfu Town pier, where they were welcomed by soldiers and police. District Chief Zhang Shiyi, Public Security Bureau Chief Xu Mengling, and local leaders such as Gu Hengru hosted the group. They took 37 pre-hired sedan chairs to Situ Temple. After arriving at the temple, they admired the ancient and peculiar old cypress trees inscribed by Emperor Qianlong and then went to the Shengen Temple, where the old monk Tieqiao led them to the Huanyuan Pavilion for tea and snacks. The monk also showed them the Zhou Bianzhong of various countries and the calligraphy of famous people, which are rarely shown. Cai Yuanpei and Huang Renzhi were invited to write poems. Later, they climbed the artificial mountain to view Taihu Lake and also re-enacted the scene of Emperor Qianlong's throne. When descending the mountain, Wu Tingjie, the Guangxi Governor, arrived with his family. The reporter stayed briefly to take a photo of them. On the way back by boat, the discussion continued until a little after 9:00 p.m. Most of the participants took rickshaws to the station from the Xin Yuan Men to depart from Suzhou. Each location along the way was photographed by the museum for commemoration.</p>

<p>(Taken by this museum)</p>
<p>On that day, the county government dispatched six police officers to patrol the waterways along the way, and the water police patrolled the boat in shifts. There were also soldiers and police protecting the participants on land, so the journey was very safe.</p>
<p>The issues discussed on the boat included vocational guidance, agriculture, industry, commerce, and supplementary education. All of them have been resolved one by one. However, the issue of women's education will be discussed later because of the lack of female experts at this meeting. Finally, a temporary proposal was passed to request the Jiangsu Provincial Government to establish a rural police training institute. For the commemoration of this conference in Suzhou, the Shanren Bridge along the way was selected to establish a rural improvement society. Zhang Zhongren, a local resident, was appointed as the chairman, and Jiang Wenyu, Hu Chunzao, Liao Nancai, Shen Yinquan, Wu Guanghan, a local Li, and Huang Renzhi and Yao Huiquan from the society were appointed as members to prepare for the implementation. The fines for exceeding the time limit for expressing opinions during the meeting (only a few copper coins) were handed over to the chairman as the starting funds for the preparation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center has recently been entrusted by a certain university in the Northeast to hire a professor of mechanics who is proficient in English, can design various machines, and can guide graduation theses and mechanical experiments. The monthly salary is 300 yuan. There is an urgent need for people. If there are talents who have studied mechanics in Europe and the United States and are willing to do so, they should go to the center to discuss the matter in person as soon as possible. The center believes that the most important thing in vocational guidance is testing. Previously, Dr. Shen Youqian, an expert in psychological testing, and Mr. Zheng Wenhan were invited to compile a general military affairs test. It has already been compiled. Now, Dr. Shen is starting to edit a kind of interest test. This test method completely imitates the various professional jobs, entertainment courses, and other items of the E.K. Strong Jr. Vocational Intereit Bland in the United States, and integrates the test materials. Those who are tested indicate their likes and dislikes for each item to observe their professional interests. This test is planned to be tried out in various banks, factories, and schools for guidance on further education and employment.</p>

<h3>Jinnan Soccer &amp; Zhenru Basketball Teams' Philippine Expedition (12)</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Wen Chu, from Manila)</p>
<p>丨 Soccer Team 6th Battle 丨丨2-1 Victory Over Colombia</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM on February 10th, the Jinnan Soccer team played against Colombia, winning 2 to 1.</p>
<h3>The Luo Family General Makes First Meritorious Achievement</h3>
<p>Both sides chose their goal; we had the advantage of facing away from the sun. The opposing team was called "Club," but in reality, it was composed of elite players selected from various teams. Everyone was filled with spirit, seeking to wash away the shame of repeated defeats in previous days. Therefore, at the start of the battle, they launched a fierce attack. Our side, riding the momentum of successive victories, did not show weakness either. Within five minutes, General Hei displayed his iron-head skills, and General Luo demonstrated his long-legged ability. The headbutt missed, but the long leg successfully connected, and the ball went into the net. Having captured the first line of defense, their courage was increased a hundredfold.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Counterattack Recaptures Territory</h3>
<p>Although the enemy suffered an initial setback, their spirit was not diminished. After the left forward received the ball, their center forward immediately took a shot from more than ten yards away from our castle. Although the goalkeeper deflected it, the ball had already crossed the line, and it was ruled valid. The first line of defense they gained was retaken in less than five minutes. How can we underestimate the enemy's strength?</p>
<p>▲ Two Armies Charge, Displaying Divine Power</p>
<p>With the score tied, this was (the first game after the Battle of Ratsat Team, the enemy's only result). Naturally, everyone was filled with spirit. General Luo received a pass from Mei Hongbao, ran forward, and took a kneeling shot, but unfortunately, it went too high and over the net, missing a great opportunity. From then on, the enemy's forwards all strove to display their skills, switching from defense to offense, coordinating passes, and attacking from far and near. Their figures were frequently seen in our territory. Fortunately, the central pillar, General Huo Fa, and the left and right defenders, Chen Jiaqiu and Liang Shutang, were stationed at the three cities, providing thorough support. To advance two more cities, we had the copper-headed and iron-legged Generals and Jiang Shanjing, whose defenses were solid. Therefore, the enemy's attacks were all unsuccessful. Our side, taking advantage of their slight fatigue, issued orders and also pressed towards the enemy's territory. At one point, General Hei received support from the rear and kicked fiercely from the right. The ball rolled along the ground and was pushed out by the enemy goalkeeper, but center forward Dai got the ball and immediately passed it to Liang Shutang, who passed it to Fu Hexuan. Fu dribbled forward, about to display his skill of "flying across the Yangtze River," when the opposing center back kicked the ball out of bounds. Before long, the enemy forward intercepted the ball and dribbled it quickly forward. Our forwards were busy in the enemy territory and couldn't rush back in time. Fortunately, the central pillar of defense responded quickly and drove the enemy back. This was a period of mixed combat. When the first half ended, the score was tied at one to one.</p>
<p>▲ The Two Sides Compete to Take the Lead</p>
<p>After the break, the battle resumed, and the competition was even more intense, as each side wanted to take the lead. The enemy took advantage of our army's vulnerability and charged straight in. Fortunately, Generals Ma and Jiang rushed back desperately, averting the danger. Our side got the ball and did not show weakness either. Center forward Dai dribbled straight up and passed it to Mei Hongbao, who passed it back. Dai took a fierce shot, but it went too high and out of bounds. The enemy got the ball and launched an attack. The right forward aimed at the city and shot, but goalkeeper Xie saved it. Center forward Dai got the ball and passed it to General Hei. These two tiger generals advanced side by side. The crowd all had hopes of success. Before aiming at the enemy goal, it was kicked out by their defender. The enemy forward took the opportunity to loft a high ball, but goalkeeper Xie rushed out and kicked it away. Chen Bingxiang intercepted it and immediately passed it to General Hei, who headed it, but it was also caught and kicked out by the enemy goalkeeper. In these few minutes, back and forth, each side displayed their fighting skills.</p>
<p>▲ Chen and Luo's Collaboration Achieves Miraculous Success</p>
<p>As the stalemate continued, the sun was setting, and time was running out. If they were not careful and the enemy scored another goal, the reputation of Jinnan University would be greatly affected. The audience was anxiously worried for our side. However, the Jinnan students, with the efforts of the crowd, used an unexpected tactic. General Hei got the ball from the rear and quickly passed it to General Luo. Luo didn't rush, but attacked the ball from the rear right and kicked it into the net. The cheers that had been suppressed for so long erupted from the overseas Chinese. From then on, although the enemy repeatedly launched counterattacks, our side was a hundred times more spirited and fought even harder. When the game ended, they won 2 to 1.</p>
<p>▲ Receiving the Winning Prize on the Spot</p>
<p>Before the game, the general secretary of the Charity Association announced that a large silver cup had been prepared as a prize for the winning team of this game. As a result, it should be won by our side. The prize was awarded on the spot by the Director of the Department of Agricultural Affairs and Natural Resources. Center forward Dai received it on behalf of the team, and the entire team chanted the victory slogan to conclude the event.</p>

<h3>Financial Specie Declines Sharply</h3>
<p>▲ Repeated Ups and Downs ··· Extreme Fluctuations</p>
<p>▲ Thirty Taels Difference  Yesterday, February 23rd, the decline of specie intensified, the state of affairs became extremely chaotic, with high to low transformations drastic like a madman's, the nerve-wracking fluctuations exceeding ten taels.  Throughout the day, the difference reached thirty taels, with no certainty, ultimately falling more than ten taels.  This was likely due to the trend of remittances declining significantly, with the posted price increasing by one and a half steps.  As for market trading, it was completely different, particularly complex and chaotic.  In the morning, Hengxing, Yuansheng, and Yuansheng bought and sold again, while Yuanmao, Yongxin, Hengyuan, and Tai were all buying in.  Hengxing, Zhifeng, Yongqian, and Changxiang generally sold out. The overseas silver market rose the day before yesterday, so the gold price fell slightly. Suddenly, large traders enthusiastically bought, soaring upwards, rising sharply by more than ten taels, almost reaching 770 taels.  Instantly, large traders such as Hengxing, Yuansheng, Yuansheng, Qianchangxiang, etc., began to sell because foreign exchange suddenly loosened, and there was talk of conflicting news about Sino-American loans, suggesting the silver price might rise again.  Therefore, people were frightened, and with the confluence of winds and waves, it plummeted by thirty taels, suddenly falling below forty taels.  At noon, there was a turning and easing, and it was raised by ten taels, seemingly due to the news that spot goods could be exported.  In short, the market formed a multi-faceted pattern due to atmospheric influences.  The after-market also had a ten-tael rebound, hovering around fifty taels, with different firms seeking various supplies.  However, remittances remained loose and abundant, and spot [gold] bars initially showed signs of expansion, so the price of spot should be more than fifty taels higher than the forward price.  It is expected that the large bars will rise again this morning, but there is no market for silver because yesterday (23rd) was a holiday in America, and work was suspended.</p>
<p>▲ Rapid Decline After Rising Early On From the opening of the four-day futures market in the morning, it decreased by two and a half taels to 757 taels. This was because the large bars rose again by one-quarter the day before, the silver price rose by one cent, and private telegrams also increased by seven-eighths of a cent. Later, large traders such as Hengxing, Yuancheng, Changsheng, Yongyuan, Heng, etc., competed to buy, jumping by eleven or twelve taels at once, although there was a one or two-tael rebound. Only Hengxing sold.  At about 9:20, it reached 69 taels. At this time, Zhifeng, Yongtai, etc., sold and fell back by more than four taels. The first order announced was long three seven five, US dollars seven five, and the Japanese gold fell by four cents and seventy-five cents. Therefore, the gold price fell to 64 and a half taels, but internally, it stabilized. Sumitomo and Macheng absorbed British gold for May and June at 123125, while Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng, Yuancheng, Yong, etc., all bought in. In an instant, it increased by five taels, reaching 69 and a half taels at 9:50. Before long, a big storm arose.  The foreign exchange gradually loosened, and there were still enthusiastic sellers on the market. Hengxing, Yuansheng, Yuancheng, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Chang and Indian merchants, and others who seized the opportunity again sold out.  It was rumored that the Sino-American loan case was brewing with no certainty. In just half an hour, it fell by more than thirty taels, suddenly to thirty-nine taels around 10:30.  Then, Huayidehua sold British gold for April and June at 1275, and Zhengjin bought 8125. Later, Yuanheng, Yuan Tai Yongfeng and others chased in.  Sumitomo Mitsui absorbed 1275 to 6875 for May, almost 11 o'clock, 48 and a half taels. Afterwards, there were four or five taels rising and falling. At noon, Yuancheng Yu Dafuxing Yong and others sold, suddenly falling to 41 taels.  In a moment, word came that a certain bank had prepared cash to be loaded onto a wheel [ship] to send abroad.  People were energized, soaring by seven or eight taels [to] 48 and a half taels at closing. Re-doing to fifty taels or more, and then 48 taels, the price was changed to 833 taels and 4 qian. It was estimated that 70 taels were pressed to 945 taels, and the noon close was 845 taels.</p>
<p>▲ After-Market with Hesitation The after-market opened at 47 and a half taels, then 52 taels, following the residual wind of the noon close. Yu Da Hongli Hengxing Yuan and others sold.  It was also heard that Indian remittances had increased by eight anna, so it fell to 44 and a half taels.  Fuchang and others came in, and Macheng ate British gold at 126875, so it rose to 50 taels, then fell back to 46 taels. Later, because Mitsui bought 126875, it rose to 51 taels at 3 o'clock.  At that time, there were three or four taels of ups and downs, then it turned sluggish.  The remittance situation was still insufficient, and Yuancheng and others sold out, falling to 42 taels at 3:30.  Later, Dadecheng and others chased to buy, suddenly raising eight taels to 50 taels at 4:20. In a moment, it fell back to 46 and a half taels.  It was really because people were unsettled and swayed by the wind. At 4:30, the closing was 48 and a half taels, compared to last Saturday, falling 11 taels. After the close, it continued to see 50 taels, and finally lost three or four taels, estimated at 467 taels.  It was found that the maximum price during the day was 69 and a half taels, the minimum price was 39 taels, with a difference of 30 taels and 05 qian. The opening price of the goods was 55 taels and 5 qian, the noon close was 48 taels. The afternoon was 47 and a half taels, the closing was 47 taels. The price was estimated to be suppressed by small amounts of 867 taels to 812 taels, and then to 912 taels. The closing was 856 taels, registered February [at] 39 taels, March [at] 42 taels, April [at] 49 taels, and the water supplement [interest] was the same in the morning and afternoon, estimated at 39 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Extremely Chaotic Transactions For each firm's transactions, it is estimated that Hengxing Yuan, Yuancheng bought and sold repeatedly. Fuchang, Futai, Zhaokang, Hengyu, Yongfeng, Senchangyong, Shunli, and Tongtaichang had different ins and outs, with still more [selling]. Wanxing, Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Hongli, Yu Da, and Qianchangxiang were all selling. Yuantai, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Changshengyong, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanheng, and Xinhneng were all buying. In the afternoon, Yu Da, Fuxingyong, Yuantai, Hengxing Yuan, and Hongli all sold. Wanxing, Shunli, and Zhifengyong bought more and sold less. Fuchang and Yuanheng bought. Futaiheng, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, etc., suddenly sold and bought. The delivery of goods was erratic. The Dalian gang bought a total of 2,200 to 2,300 bars, but also sold 2,400 to 2,500 bars. The Guangdong gang also sold 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Loosens Significantly</h3>
<p>▲ Conflicting Specie Imports and Exports ··· Highly Active Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's posted foreign exchange rates all increased by one and a half steps. This was due to the trend of the overseas silver market rising the day before yesterday, estimated to increase by three seven five for British gold, estimated to be one shilling and two pence and one-twelfth of a pence. US dollars increased by seven five, estimated to be 28 and a half yuan. Indian remittances increased by two yuan, estimated to be 79 rupees and 25 cents. French francs [were] 20 yuan and 25 cents. Heyang [Japanese yen] increased by two yuan, estimated to be 71 shields and 25 cents. Singapore fell by five taels and five qian, estimated to be 196 and a half taels. Hong Kong increased by 25, estimated to be 78 taels and 75 cents. The Japanese exchange rate decreased by four cents and seventy-five cents, estimated to be one tael, seven qian, and three cents. The domestic market was also loose and abundant, and the gold market turned from rising to weakening, the storm was very large, and the difference throughout the day was thirty taels, making it very difficult to handle. It was really because of the rumor that cash could be exported, and the problem of Sino-American loans was looming, already forming a closed game. As a result, all exchange rates compared to last Saturday estimated that British gold increased by four three seven five, US dollars increased by eight seven five, and Japanese gold fell by four cents and seventy-five cents. There were conflicting demands from Chinese merchants in the gold market, and trading was very active. It is estimated that British gold totaled 560,000 pounds, and silver prices [were] sold by Korean, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Huabi, Datong, Huayide, etc. Mitsui, Sumitomo, Macheng, Zhejiang, Zhengjin, Huabi, Korea, [text unclear] and others all bought in, and various banks did tens of thousands of pounds. Most firms also did forward [specie] trading. US dollars were thrown out for two to three hundred thousand yuan, and Mitsui Shanghai, etc., bought some. For Japanese gold, only tens of thousands of yuan were imported and exported, and the market's confusion was not easy to grasp, but the trend was sluggish.</p>

The morning asking price was one shilling, two pence, three one three five, and the buying price was three seven five.

<h3>Silver Market Slightly Develops</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview Presenting an opportunity. Commercial practice is that every New Year, businesses operate at half capacity, so the market is more relaxed than usual. Although the Gregorian calendar is used this time, old customs are still difficult to eradicate. As a result, there is compliance in public but defiance in private, continuing as in previous years. In the end, the market was sluggish, starting to show a slight opportunity yesterday. Bank receipts and payments have been slightly reported, but the money market still operates only half a day, so there is no way to develop it.</p>
<p>▲ Silver gradually rises. The silver price has the potential for progress, so it rises gradually every day. Yesterday, it was 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, an increase of 3 hao, 7 and a half from the previous day's higher price. The situation is still promising, but with the imminent arrival of the god of wealth silver, which all ports have been accustomed to, it is still possible that the silver price will weaken. The early silver market was still white loan [interest-free], and there was no market at noon as usual, and the clearing rate was also unavailable.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary coins rise in the south and fall in Guangdong. The small silver coins in Jiangnan rose yesterday to 6 qian, 8 fen, 5 li, an increase of 1 fen and 2 li from the previous day. 4,000 jiao [units] were easily sold in the early market. The small silver coins in Guangdong, on the other hand, fell by 4 li and 2 hao and a half, to 6 qian, 6 fen, 3 li, 7 hao and a half. 175,000 jiao [units] were traded. No transactions opened in the noon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 365,000 wen [coins], and over 27,000 strings [of coins] were traded.</p>
<p>▲ Silver imports and exports slightly increase. Yesterday was Monday, and there were intermittent reports of bank receipts and payments. It is estimated that Chinese merchants received 780,000 in bill receipts, foreign merchants received over 800,000, and various goods, remittances, taxes and other receipts totaled over 2 million. Imports and exports each totaled 300,000. Japanese banks received over 1.3 million in various receipts and 200,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Silver public [money exchange] firms' single receipts totaled over 14 million, and clearing receipts totaled over 1.1 million. In the early market, foreign exchange bill receipts amounted to 940,000, and banknotes only amounted to 144,000 in outside deals. Bank transactions totaled over 400,000. No transactions were made in the noon market. The foreign exchange accounts of various banks have been opened, estimated to import and export 670,000, banknote imports and exports 780,000. Public silver [money exchange] firms' single receipts totaled over 2.4 million, and foreign exchange clearing receipts totaled over 700,000. Small money market transactions totaled over 200,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Strong and Prices Firm</h3>
<p>▲ 9.3 Million Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the local securities and bond markets saw little trading in the spot market. Each firm only made sporadic transactions. The futures market, on the other hand, was very lively. Trading was active, and there were many eager to sell at high prices, and investors were also keen to buy in. The fluctuations between the two rounds were only half a yuan, and they rose two, three cents to half a yuan compared to the end of the previous week. The firm situation was unprecedented. It is estimated that futures trading totaled more than 9.3 million yuan, including 1931 and 1932, each reaching 1.6 million. The 1929 customs, demobilization, and disarmament bonds averaged 1 million. Other items were flat, and spot trading totaled only 8,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Rapidly Declines</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned sluggish, and the decline was drastic. The recent changes have been very worrying. However, most buyers have a strong attitude and no intention of selling, and the high level of scrutiny is very deep. Most need to see 190 taels. However, there is a saying that the United States is maintaining the [cotton] price, and the overseas cotton market has loosened a bit, so people's hearts have softened a little. Most short sellers cleared out at the peak of rising prices, and the market situation was relatively stable. When encountering bad news, the reaction was even more intense. The current yarn market, with the Jin gang, has better business due to labor unrest. Other businesses are very difficult. In the afternoon, it fell by as much as five or six taels. There are still huge changes in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Forward Specie Plunges by Five or Six Taels The forward specie market opened with a calm gold price. The remaining atmosphere from the previous day had not dissipated. Near months rose 7 qian, and far months all fell 2 qian to 1 tael and 13 qian. In the afternoon, the market situation changed drastically, and the decline surged. As the current price fell, retail investors settled, and each fell 6 taels and 5 qian to 3 taels and 5 qian. The total volume of the day was 31,500. It was found that the selling companies were recorded as 1,100 bales, Minde 1,150 bales, Xinchang 1,400 bales, and Yuda 900 bales. The buying companies were recorded as 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 2,950 bales, Yichang 2,900 bales, and Ruidai 1,200 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

The market situation was firm in the morning and fell by one tael in the afternoon. After closing, the price was too low, and no transactions were made. Among the customer gangs, 280 bales were imported to the mainland, 35 bales to Guangdong, 55 bales to Xuzhou, 80 bales to Jiangxi, 160 bales to Tianjin, 50 bales to Qinhuangdao, 125 bales to Sichuan, and 80 bales to miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Collapses</h3>
<p>▲ Gold Price Falls...Strong Selling Pressure...Dong Cotton Still Being Purchased</p>
<p>The cotton market softened, and the decline was weaving. The recent rate of change, the magnitude of the increase and decrease, is very difficult to grasp. The Indian cotton market has fallen by a large amount of 8 rupees, and the foreign exchange reversal has made people even more exhausted. It is heard that short sellers cleared at the peak, and floating buyers were relatively scarce. In the afternoon, the gold price was falling, and the market [deteriorated] further. The selling pressure in the market was strong, and each [seller] fell by one tael and seven or eight qian. It is said that the Japanese trading house Dongmian Yoko also made purchases. The future must depend on the foreign exchange and foreign cotton markets for the shift.</p>
<p>▲ Desert Specie Suddenly Drops by More Than Two Taels In the early market, the Exchange Han Standard [cotton] opened due to the large drop in Indian cotton, causing the market to soften slightly and the number of buyers to decrease. Each [price] fell by three or four qian. In the afternoon, due to the poor news in the gold market, the market fell, and each [price] fell by 1 tael and 6 qian and a half to 1 tael and 9 qian. The total volume of the day was 84,200 dan [units]. It was found that Gongtai sold 3,900 dan, Minde 2,000 dan, Yicheng 3,300 dan, Changfeng 2,600 dan, Lichang 2,800 dan, and Deji 2,100 dan.

<h3>Grains: Deteriorating Environment Causes Flour Market to Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, suddenly showed signs of a sharp decline in prices for all months. The rise and fall of the current market have completely deviated from the actual situation of the flour market itself. Based on the circumstances, before the weekend opening, due to spot goods and gold prices, it caused outsiders to rush to buy, and the market atmosphere was strong. When the price opened yesterday, the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly lower by 126 corners. The gold market, because of the hope of a large loan agreement, also plummeted, causing people to unanimously look down and sell vigorously. The inexperienced bulls have no courage to enter further in this reversal of the environment, and because the large short positions belong to the factories and speculative short selling, there is a difference between getting on and off the bed, so they are calm and composed as usual. The factories were still actively selling during both the morning and afternoon sessions, and floating bulls were rushing to get out, so the market continued to plummet. As a result, the current month fell 7 cents compared to the previous weekend, March fell 6 cents and 2.5 mills, April and May fell 6.5 cents, June fell 8 cents and 7.5 mills, and July fell 8.5 cents, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Plummets Sharply</h3>
<p>▲ Especially severe in forward months... plummeting ¥0.024</p>
<p>Yesterday, futures wheat prices for all months saw a strange and sharp decline. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly lower, and the exchange rate also continued to fall, people generally speculated that the fall in the overall price following the conclusion of the large loan was also expected. With this phenomenon, the future exchange rate will relax, and ordering foreign wheat for delivery will naturally have to be activated again. Therefore, people's hearts were greatly disturbed, and sellers in the industry were even more eager to sell, and the situation became more turbulent. The trend of current growth and decline still needs to be based on foreign countries as a guide. It is found that if the foreign exchange rate changes after this kind of situation of easy rise and easy fall, some disturbances will still be unavoidable. Trading was very active throughout the day, reaching more than 600 vehicles. As a result, the current month fell ¥0.013 on the previous day, March fell ¥0.013, April fell ¥0.015, May fell ¥0.018, June fell ¥0.019, and July alone fell a huge ¥0.024, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Factories Resuming Operations One After Another</h3>
<p>Due to the plunge in European sales of factory silk last year, Shanghai's silk factories suffered from low capital and exhausted funds, facing bankruptcy and total shutdown. Although some factories tried hard to resume work, they opened and stopped intermittently. At the beginning of last month, more than 40 factories borrowed cocoons from the financial sector to start their machines. Around the end of the lunar year, female workers voluntarily stopped working and refused to go to the factories, so the factories had no choice but to temporarily suspend work. Now that the old lunar new year has passed, and the government's silk industry bonds are about to be issued, the factories are eager to resume operations. Yesterday, more than ten factories, such as Ruilun and Xinyi, had already started their machines, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sui'an Zhenmei Tea Actively Being Sold in England</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market, Sui'an Zhenmei green tea, sold by British firms like Jardine Matheson and Concord, because the Russian firm's assistance association is about to open, buying has resumed. More than 610 boxes were traded throughout the city, and the selling price was unchanged from the settlement period. Morocco has telegraphed yesterday for needle eyebrow and show eyebrow green teas, but the inventory is lacking, and the supply cannot meet the demand. More than 1,000 boxes of Gongxi green tea were purchased by British firms like Baitou Zhuangfu yesterday for sale in ports such as Persia and Mumbai, it is said.</p>
<h3>Coal: Door Sales Prices of Coal Increase One After Another</h3>
<p>In recent days, the price of charcoal has risen sharply, and the door sales prices of stove coal and household coal in various coal shops in this port have also increased one after another. For example, Hongqi white coal Lingjiao blocks are now sold for ¥40 per ton, an increase of ¥2 compared to before. Ordinary blocks also cost ¥38. Shanxi white coal costs ¥36, Mark white coal Haifeng white coal costs ¥36, Liujiang white coal costs ¥28, Number 1 coal costs ¥24, Number 2 bituminous coal costs ¥22, Number 3 bituminous coal costs ¥20, Number 1 bituminous coal chips costs ¥17, and Hongqi chips costs ¥16.</p>

<h3>The Outline of Business Tax Remains Largely Unchanged</h3>
<p>▲ The Ministry of Finance Replies to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce by Telegram</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously sent a letter and telegram to the Ministry of Finance from various chambers of commerce, stating that the outline for collecting business tax formulated by the Ministry of Finance was inconsistent with the original plan resolved at the National Likin Abolition Conference in 1928. They specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for an explanation. Yesterday, the Federation received a reply telegram stating, "To Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Shanghai National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, et al.: I have read the Fish-Dai telegram in its entirety. The outline for collecting business tax passed by the Executive Yuan and implemented in various provinces and cities this time is the original plan resolved at the National Likin Abolition Conference in 1928. The points of amendment only include the deletion of the seven characters 'or hinder the development of domestic goods' under Article 4, which contains matters that should be banned, and the amendment of the two characters 'examination' in 'establishment of a business tax review committee' in Article 5 to 'deliberation.' The remaining clauses have not changed much. The inconsistencies mentioned in the telegram are probably due to misunderstandings. As for the draft business regulations of Jiangsu Province, the province has been approved to send a note to the Ministry. If the business classification, tax standard, and tax rate exceed the provisions of the outline and supplementary measures ordered by the Ministry, they should be reviewed and amended separately, and the province should be notified to instruct the Department of Finance to comply with the regulations. You should immediately inform all chambers of commerce accordingly. [Seal of] the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<h3>The Joint Association of Silk and Satin Merchants in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Announces Compliance with the Order to Pay Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Because the Government Has Clearly Defined It As a Daily Necessity for Common People</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Silk and Satin Guilds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai announced to the various silk and satin industry groups: "The various silk and satin industry groups in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai previously reported that the business tax rates stipulated by the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces exceeded the outline stipulated by the Ministry, exceeding the maximum limit of 2/1000 by more than 7 times, which was impossible to bear. Representatives were sent to Beijing to petition and announced in newspapers to the silk industry groups and merchants in various provinces and cities that in order to respect the central government's orders and protect the survival of the silk industry, until the business tax rates of silk and satin in various provinces and cities are revised in accordance with the outline stipulated by the Ministry to a maximum of no more than 2/1000, payment should be temporarily suspended. Now, on February 18, we respectfully read the approval from the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association telegram read: 'We have checked and inquired about the case of requesting a reduction in the business tax on silk fabrics in Zhejiang Province. We have added our opinions and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions and telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to handle it. Now we have received instructions from the Executive Yuan, which read: "I have read the report. It is said that silk and satin are special national products and need protection, and their uses are also daily necessities for common people. Please instruct all provinces to collect business tax on this item, and the tax rate shall not exceed 2/1000 to protect it." This is in line with the previous order from the Central Government to relieve the silk weaving industry and should be approved. Please order the Ministry of Finance and the governments of all provinces and cities to comply with and handle it accordingly." We hereby notify you accordingly.' On the same day, we also received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating, 'We have checked that Article 1 of the Business Tax Outline of various provinces states that silk factories and silk factories are excluded from the special taxes collected by the central government. If the central government has already collected special taxes, all manufacturing industries and the wholesale industries directly established by them can be exempted from business tax. The wholesale and retail industries in the goods sales industry should still be collected to show the distinction. In addition to separately amending the draft business tax regulations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, and notifying the Provincial Government to instruct the Department of Finance to comply with the regulations, we hereby notify you accordingly.' It can be seen that the central government has foresight and is committed to protecting the silk industry. Our Association has carefully interpreted the approval order. One says that 'silk and satin are special national products and need protection,' another says that 'their uses are also daily necessities for common people,' and a third says that 'it is in line with the previous order from the Central Government to relieve the silk weaving industry.' It is already clearly indicated and affirmed by the central government that silk and satin are daily necessities and not luxury businesses, and the wording is clear and obvious. Our provincial and municipal governments can understand the virtue and comply with the order to regulate the business tax rate of the silk and satin industry to below 2/1000. Since the government can understand the difficulties of the silk industry and provide extra protection, the silk merchants should do their best to fulfill their tax obligations and comply with the order to pay taxes. This is hereby announced, and we hope you will take note of it. The Preparatory Committee of the Joint Association of Silk and Satin Guilds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, address: 96 Beijing Road, Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Various Industries Request Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Ham Industry: The Ham Industry Association in this city, because the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces have stipulated that the business tax rate for the industry is collected at 15/1000, which exceeds the provisions of the outline, and the business is unable to bear the burden, specifically sent representatives Cai Xiaohe, Zhu Hanwo, Xin Wenxuan, etc., to Beijing yesterday with representatives from the Suzhou Salted Meat and Ham and Egg Industry Association to petition the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry separately, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Western Paint Industry: The Western Paint Industry Association telegraphed Hu Hanmin, President of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, Finance Minister Song Ziwen, and Industry Minister Kong Xiangxi yesterday, requesting a reduction in the business tax rate. The original telegram briefly stated: "The tax rate of 10/1000 for paint is an erroneous calculation, causing great consternation. We hereby express our grievances and telegraphically request your government, yuan, and ministries to consider the difficulties of the business, make every effort to correct it, and order the Shanghai Municipal Government, Finance Bureau, and Business Tax Preparatory Office to comply with Article 4 of the Ministry-promulgated Outline for Paint Sales Tax and reduce it to 1/1000, which shall not exceed the standard of 2/1000, in order to alleviate business difficulties and maintain people's livelihood.

<p>▲ Send Letters to Various Sectors Asking for Consistent Assistance</p>
<p>▲ Do Not Allow Swedish Merchants to Succeed in Their Invasion</p>
<p>The Qingdao Match Industry Federation, because the consolidated tax on matches is collected too heavily, convened meetings several times to discuss and decided to send Qu Jiantang and Sun Juncheng as representatives to petition the Ministry of Finance in Beijing. Mr. Sun and Mr. Qu arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and took a train to Beijing last night. It is said that the Qingdao City used phosphorus sulfide matches, which were mostly Japanese goods. Every year, the money was lost overseas, which was impossible to count. Over the past year, local people have raised funds to start domestic match factories in order to resist foreign goods. All products are relatively excellent. In addition to supplying the entire Qingdao City, the remaining amount can be transported to Tianjin and various counties in the interior of Shandong Province. Invisibly, a lot of interests and rights have been recovered. This time, the central government implemented a unified tax. The tax rate on phosphorus sulfide matches is as high as 40%. All manufacturers are unable to bear the heavy tax burden. The factories in the city will all close down one after another. Tens of thousands of men and women workers will also lose their livelihoods. The Federation appointed Yu and two others to petition the Ministry of Finance to show sympathy for the difficulties of the domestic industry and reduce the consolidated tax rate, it is said. The Federation also sent letters to colleagues and people from all walks of life, hoping to provide assistance based on the principle of helping each other in the same boat. The letter is recorded as follows: "Respected sirs, for years, the match industry in our country has been invaded by foreign merchants externally and suffered from heavy donations and taxes internally. It is in imminent danger. If there is no corresponding maintenance method, it will inevitably perish together. Since the first day of this year, after the government implemented the abolition of likin, the accumulated malpractices over the years have been cleared, and all Chinese people have been celebrating. However, after the abolition of likin, unified taxes will be used to offset it, but the unified tax rate is too high, and it is really difficult for businesses and people to bear. The disadvantages are described as follows: (1) The unified tax rate is too high, and manufacturers are unable to pay the advance. According to the Department's regulations on unified taxes, matches are collected at 7 yuan and 5 jiao in national currency per large box (7,200 boxes with a length of more than 43 mm and less than 52 mm), which refers to safety matches. However, the length of phosphorus sulfide matches (commonly known as red-headed matches) in Shandong is only 40 mm, and each large box is usually 14,400 boxes, with a tax of 15 yuan, which will be nearly half of the value of the goods. For small factories, the cost is only about 10,000 yuan. If 20 boxes are shipped per day, 300 yuan of tax must be paid, which is 9,000 yuan per month. The large factories that ship 100 boxes a day have to pay more than 40,000 yuan in taxes every month. According to the industry's practice of selling goods, it takes at least three or four months to receive payment after shipping out of the factory, and some even take more than half a year. How can they have so much power to pay such a huge amount in advance? (2) The unified tax rate is unfair. The tax rate stipulated in the unified tax regulations is that cotton yarn is taxed at no more than 5%, cement is taxed at no more than 8-9%, and flour is only 2%. However, each box of phosphorus sulfide matches (14,400 boxes) sells for less than 40 yuan, and the tax is 15 yuan, so the unified rate exceeds 40%. In terms of matches, the price of 7,200 boxes of safety matches is the same as the price of 14,400 boxes of phosphorus sulfide matches, but the unified tax paid is twice as much for phosphorus sulfide matches. The government promotes industry and should reduce the tax rate on necessities for the daily use of the poor to enrich people's livelihood. However, the tax amount set is several times higher than others, which is difficult to understand. (3) Matches are related to people's livelihood. Phosphorus sulfide matches are purely necessary for farmers, workers, and the poor, so the selling price is low. According to the annual average calculation, the selling price per large box is only 34-5 yuan. Now, due to the surge in gold prices, expensive raw materials, and the gradual increase in the cost of artificial life, the current cost calculation is more than 50 yuan. In addition, the economic invasion of Sweden is selling cheaply everywhere. The match selling price has no way to increase. If 15 yuan is levied per box, it will not only be difficult to sell, but the poor will be limited by the economy and will inevitably cause a fire-fighting system, which is not the ultimate intention of the Prime Minister to promote people's livelihood. (4) The unified tax is just to help Sweden's invasion succeed. Sweden has always held the ambition to annex the world's matches. In recent years, it has acquired many Japanese match factories in our country, sold them at a loss, and carried out an invasion. The Chinese factories with weak capital have repeatedly received government relief, such as reduced railway transportation, etc., and are still not enough to compete with them. If this major unified tax is levied again, it will inevitably lead to shutdowns and closures, wouldn't it be to drive away birds for the sake of the forest, turning to help the Swedish merchants succeed in their invasion? Given the above four points, our Association has consulted repeatedly, but there is no way. We can only ask the government to allow the implementation of the match monopoly system in the three northeastern provinces to provide relief. We have now sent representatives to Beijing to petition, hoping that you will provide consistent assistance based on the friendship of helping each other in the same boat.</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan's Speech on the General Situation of Social Administration in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA's Municipal Research Society held a speech by Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, the day before yesterday (Saturday). On that day, the Social Affairs Bureau first displayed 72 statistical charts from various departments, as well as 37 types of publications of the bureau, arranged by Shao Songsheng and Xue Wenyuan of the bureau. Director Pan arrived at the meeting at 4 p.m. to give a speech, which was attended by more than 300 listeners and ended at around 6 p.m. The following is a transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>Today, I am honored to be invited by the YMCA's Municipal Research Society to speak on the general situation of social administration in Shanghai. As the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, I have a duty to report on this type of issue. However, the term "social" has a very broad meaning and encompasses too much. To put it simply, matters handled by the central government, the provincial government, the municipal government, and the county government are all related to social affairs. People cannot exist independently of society, and therefore, prosperity, decline, rise, and fall are all closely related. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Politics is the matter of the people, governance is management, and managing the affairs of the people is called politics." In other words, the affairs of the people are the affairs of society. Since the scope of society is so broad, why haven't we heard of social affairs bureaus in European and American countries, or a social affairs department in the central government? Even the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) and provincial governments have not established social affairs departments or offices. Why is there a social affairs bureau only in the municipal organization law? This type of title also exists in Japan. However, the social affairs bureau in Japan only manages matters related to public welfare, charity, and relief, which is different from the Social Affairs Bureau in our country's municipal organization law, which has the same name but different functions. According to the provisions of the municipal organization law, the municipal government has 24 functions, and the Social Affairs Bureau occupies 10 of them, almost half. In addition to agriculture, industry, commerce, public welfare, charity, and relief, education and public utilities are also within the functions of the Social Affairs Bureau according to the municipal organization law. Currently, education and public utilities in Shanghai have become independent agencies. After removing these two, the Social Affairs Bureau still occupies eight functions. The Social Affairs Bureau was established in August of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). To date, it has been two years and seven months. Before the Social Affairs Bureau, it was the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce, which was established in July of the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927). Speaking of the Social Affairs Bureau, it is just a two-and-a-half-year-old child. Even when combined with the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce, it is only a three-year-old child. In terms of qualifications, it can be said to be extremely immature. So, what are the achievements of the Social Affairs Bureau? This should first be observed from the perspective of its funding and time. Insufficient funding is truly like the ancient saying, "Even a clever woman cannot cook without rice." If the funding is sufficient, but the time is not enough, it is also difficult to expect rapid progress. People in society often have an incorrect judgment, believing that the municipal administration of the foreign concessions is progressing and becoming better every day, while the municipal administration of the Chinese area does not seem to have much progress. The reason for this cannot be blamed on the authorities. It should be known that the Public Concession has a very large income and a history of more than 80 years, while the municipal government only has a history of three and a half years. The difference in time is so great that it is, of course, impossible to catch up with their achievements. Now, I will report on the expenses of the Social Affairs Bureau over the years. In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), it was 12,495 yuan per month. In the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), it was 16,373 yuan. In the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), it was 19,431 yuan. In addition, the temporary expenses were 19,000 yuan in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), 22,000 yuan in the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), and 28,000 yuan in the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930). Comparing the above figures, it is indeed increasing year by year. However, according to the distribution of the municipal government's financial resources over the years, it accounted for 5% when it was the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), 4.3% after the reorganization into the Social Affairs Bureau in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), 4.5% in the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), and 4.5% in the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930). This is because the municipal government's funding has increased year by year. The Social Affairs Bureau is one of the agencies under the municipal government, and its finances are less than one-twentieth, while the affairs it manages account for eight-twentieths. As for what the Social Affairs Bureau does in terms of agriculture, industry, and commerce, I will tell you separately. (A) Agriculture: Shanghai is entirely a metropolis. Why is agriculture still needed? It should be known that there are still fields in the areas around Shanghai that have not been developed into business districts. Furthermore, according to the trend of the world, cities must adopt the natural beauty of rural areas. Therefore, this point cannot be ignored. As a result, the Social Affairs Bureau is handling two agricultural matters. (1) Garden nursery: It has only been in operation for two years since it started, so there are not many trees that can be transplanted. It is estimated that the number of branches transplanted each year will be 1,650 in the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), 110 in the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), 1,590 in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), 65,480 in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), and 560,000 in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). (2) Agricultural experiment station: It specializes in researching the seeds of agricultural products, such as cotton, rice, beans, and wheat. In the future, if successful experiments are made, these seeds will be distributed to the countryside to promote good agricultural production and progress. However, because there is not much funding and the land is too small, it is planned to purchase more land and add manpower to expand it in the future. (B) Industry: In the industrial sector, there is an industrial goods testing institute, which has been established for two years and specializes in researching the improvement of industrial products. The start-up cost was 20,000 yuan, and the monthly recurring expenses were previously about 1,000 yuan, but have now been increased to 1,500 yuan. Since its establishment, the number of factories in Shanghai requesting tests has gradually increased, and it will need to be expanded in the future. After a comprehensive survey of factories in Shanghai in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), there were about 1,500 factories. The new additions and closures have not yet been investigated. It is because the knowledge of Chinese merchants is too simple, and they often suspect the personnel sent by government agencies for investigation, refusing them in every way, making it difficult to carry out an investigation. The difficulties are beyond description. (C) Commerce: In the commercial sector, the Social Affairs Bureau has conducted a comprehensive survey of the customs and practices of various industries to obtain a systematic standard in each industry and improve it. More than 50 industries have been surveyed. Here, I will take the pawnshop industry in Shanghai as an example. There are more than 500 pawnshops in Shanghai, but only 50 to 60 are under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, with the majority located within the concessions. The interest rates of pawnshops are as high as 6 to 9 percent per month. When the revolutionary army arrived in Shanghai in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), strict measures were taken to crack down on this high-interest exploitation. The Social Affairs Bureau conducted a survey of the industry and made regulations that the monthly interest rate for pawnshops should not exceed 2 percent, and the monthly interest rate for rough pawned items should not exceed 3 percent. After these regulations were made, those who did not understand thought that the Social Affairs Bureau still favored the pawnshop merchants and ignored the suffering of the common people. In fact, this is not the case. The nature of the pawnshop industry is to regulate the livelihood of the common people, which is a kind of commercial activity, different from ordinary lending. Ordinary lending is based on the amount of financial resources as the standard. If there is 1,000 yuan that can be lent, after the loan is used up, those who come later can be rejected. Pawnshops are not like this. If their personal financial resources are exhausted, they must borrow from the money industry to make ends meet. If so, then they must pay interest, plus expenses such as rent, food, and servants. They use their income to make up for their expenses, and merchants must always make a profit. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau weighed the situation and took into account the interests of the merchants on the one hand and the suffering of the common people on the other, so that both parties could benefit. However, the situation in the concessions remains the same. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) and Chinese directors have been repeatedly consulted to crack down on high interest rates, the result is still zero. (D) Labor: In the labor sector, the Social Affairs Bureau has been looking at the living standards and wages of workers, and whether their income is sufficient to cover their living expenses. Since the beginning, 500 workers have been used as a standard, and people have been sent to their homes every day to register their daily expenses. After more than a year, an approximate figure was obtained. It is planned to conduct further investigations in the future to set a minimum price for wages in the future. As for the mediation work of the Social Affairs Bureau, it is entirely a passive work. Since its handling, disputes have gradually decreased. In the future, it is hoped that they will not occur at all, so that society can be peaceful and all industries can develop. The situation of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial administration of the Social Affairs Bureau has been described above. However, there are many other issues. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will continue to report to you on public welfare and charitable administration, and so on.</p>

<h3>Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau After Moving to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Temporarily Using Jiangnan Shipyard for Office</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, Two Aircraft Were Test-Flown</p>
<p>The Navy Majiang Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau, after moving to Shanghai from Fujian the day before yesterday, is temporarily using the Jiangnan Shipyard for office because the building being constructed in the city has not yet been completed. All the staff and the Deputy Director, Zeng Yijing, are temporarily residing at the Jiangnan Shipyard. After the old warehouse is renovated, they will move in again. At 2 p.m. yesterday, He Jian and Jie Chengdong, instructors from the Naval Aviation Office of the city, flew two land-based aircraft, "Jiang" and "Jiangyang", from Hongqiao Airport to the airspace in front of the Gaochangmiao Aircraft Factory, soaring back and forth for more than an hour before returning slowly. It is reported that both the "Jiang" and "Jiangyang" aircraft were manufactured by the Majiang Aircraft Factory.</p>
<h3>Aviation News</h3>
<p>▲Two Seamen's Congress Delegates: The first National Seamen's Congress was held in Guangzhou last year. The second National Seamen's Congress this year is scheduled to be held in Shanghai. The venue is the Shanghai Seamen's Union General Assembly Hall on Fuzhou Road. The date has been agreed to be April 1st. Yesterday, the Shanghai Seamen's Union was discussing the selection of delegates to the second National Seamen's Congress. If the number of delegates is elected according to the number of members in each department, it would not be fair. Committee members Wang Yongsheng and others proposed that the delegates to this Congress should be elected according to department to avoid imbalance. After the decision is made, the branch unions across the country will be notified.</p>
<p>▲Nippon Yusen Kaisha Deficit and Layoffs: Nippon Yusen Kaisha suffered a total loss of 5 million yuan last year. This year, in order to tighten expenses, it must lay off employees again. It has telegraphed to branches across the country to send the list of employees to the head office for the purpose of employee retention. In addition, the company previously announced the recruitment of female attendants to serve on various ships. Later, the Shanghai branch received as many as four or five hundred letters of application. Some even held newspapers that reported the matter and went to the company to inquire about the examination dates. The inquiries were endless. The company considered that this matter was presided over by the head office in Japan and that the recruits were Japanese women, not Chinese women. Recently, there have been too many inquiries, and it is difficult to answer them all. It is planned to issue a correction notice to avoid those who are mistaken from running around in vain. The Shanghai branch does not recruit Chinese female waiters.</p>
<p>▲Shanghai-Ningbo Fee Increase Stalled: The San Gong Tong (三公同) company planned to increase the fare and passenger ticket for the Shanghai-Ningbo route by 20% from the 18th of this month to fund the escort team. This matter has aroused opposition from merchants in Ningbo, and the ship waiters have unanimously resisted. Recently, the Ship Waiters' Union has also petitioned the Ministry of Communications, requesting that the increase in fees by the three companies be stopped. Yesterday, the Ministry of Communications issued an order, ordering China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, and others to submit the reasons for increasing the fare and passenger ticket and the reasons for adding the escort team by the deadline for review and decision. As a result, the fee increase on the 18th had to be postponed, and the escort police team did not board the ship. Negotiations are currently underway with all parties.</p>
<p>▲Northern Ports Frozen and Not Open: There have been two major cold spells in the North this month. The Baihe River has frozen again, and even the outside of Tanggu Port has solid ice. More than a dozen merchant ships in Tianjin Port are blocked by the ice. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai telegraphed to Tianjin to inquire. They received a reply saying that the solid ice in the Baihe River has not melted, and none of the ships blocked in the port have left. Icebreakers can do nothing. They telegraphed to inform the Chinese ships in Shanghai to postpone their trips to Tianjin for the time being.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Transportation Should Use Domestic Ships</h3>
<p>▲Ministry of Communications Orders Shipping Association</p>
<p>In view of the fact that foreign shipping companies are gradually expanding their business and arbitrarily sailing on inland rivers, which has greatly affected Chinese shipping merchants, and that the Chinese people do not pay enough attention to the promotion of domestic goods, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially convened the National Industry and Commerce Conference last year and proposed that domestic goods and company items should be transported by domestic shipping companies first. The proposal was passed by the conference and requested that the Ministries of Communications and Industry and Commerce jointly handle it. Yesterday, the Shanghai Shipping Association received an order from the Ministry of Communications saying, "In order to comply with the order, it is hereby informed that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has consulted regarding the Industry and Commerce Conference in the file of the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, regarding shipping matters, including the proposal submitted by this Ministry that domestic goods and public goods should be transported by domestic shipping companies first. The conference resolved to consult and request joint handling, etc. In this regard, after investigation, items two and three of the original proposal should be submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance for verification and handling by this Ministry and the Ministry of Industry separately. Item one of the proposal, in addition to being notified by the Ministry of Industry to the industrial and commercial organizations in various provinces for compliance, is hereby copied and issued to the association for forwarding to all shipping companies for their information. This order, etc." After receiving the order, the association immediately notified all members to investigate and comply.</p>
<h3>All Companies Must Report Election of Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>▲Order from the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry stated that when the term of office of the directors and supervisors of registered companies expires, they should be re-elected and reported for record. However, many companies are still unaware of this procedure. Therefore, order No. 2324 was issued, which stated, "In order to order matters, it is found that when the term of office of the directors and supervisors of each company expires, they should be re-elected and reported for record. This company has not reported since it was approved for registration, which is inappropriate. It should be known that the directors and supervisors are the representatives of the company. If they are not reported for record, the impact will be huge. The company is hereby ordered to report the names and addresses of the current directors and supervisors, as well as the number of shares held, within ten days of receiving this order, without any delay. This order," etc.</p>

<h3>Central Government Abolishes Regulations on the Organization of Farmers' Associations</h3>
<p>▲City Party Headquarters Complies with Order</p>
<p>The Farmers' Association Law and the implementing regulations of the Farmers' Association Law were promulgated and implemented by the National Government on December 30th of last year and January 31st of this year, respectively. The regulations on the organization of farmers' associations promulgated on July 7th of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928) were also abolished by the 125th Standing Committee of the Central Government. From now on, all farmers' organizations in various places should be reorganized or organized in accordance with the new law. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters has received the above order and has forwarded it to all districts yesterday for their information. It is also reported that the Training Department of the Central Government has prepared a method for provincial and special municipality party headquarters and county and city party headquarters to guide the organization of farmers' associations, which has also been submitted to and passed by the 126th Standing Committee of the Central Government and promulgated to party headquarters in various places for compliance and guidance. After receiving this order, the Executive Committee of the city has handed it over to the Civil Training Committee for handling.</p>
<h3>Two Railways Restrict Year-End Salary Increases for Employees</h3>
<p>Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways who have no faults during the year are entitled to a salary increase at the end of each year in accordance with their position and grade, as a reward. Indirectly, this can make employees work diligently and abide by the rules cautiously. Therefore, employees who have been serving for a long time without any faults, even if their positions are not superior, can still serve with peace of mind, thanks to this. It is now heard that in the future, those who have no special achievements will not be allowed to request a salary increase at will. Even if their achievements are particularly outstanding and there are facts to prove it, it must be stated before they can enjoy a salary increase.</p>
<h3>Anhui Association Asks to Prohibit Opium by Telegram</h3>
<p>(1) To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Anti-Opium Commission: The rumor of opium monopoly is rampant, causing widespread suspicion and opposition among the people. This is a line of righteousness. We earnestly hope that the government will adhere to the policy of prohibition and not be taken advantage of by corrupt elements, causing international shame again. It is found that Anhui Province completely prohibited opium during the tenure of Governor Bo Qian in the second year of the Republic of China (1913). Westerners transported opium through the provincial capital, but were defeated by justice and eventually burned. Domestically, the opium seedlings in various counties were strictly eradicated. Opium offenders fled at the news, making Anhui the first province to report the prohibition. After 1923, warlords took turns to profit from opium. For more than ten years, they have been following the bad habits. Now, northern Anhui has become the richest source of opium production, and western Anhui has become the area with the most red pills. The people are emaciated and pale, but there is no Zheng Xia to draw a picture. Lucrative posts have led to disputes over territory. People are the fish, and the officials are the knife and chopping board. Even under the white flag, party members and officials openly compete to collect opium taxes, without shame. Although no reports of prohibition have been heard from other provinces, no Anhui person feels more ashamed than this. Our government has long suffered deeply from the opium aggression of imperialism, and has inherited the Prime Minister's legacy of opium prohibition. It has set up special agencies to implement the determination to prohibit opium. The people are also stretching their necks and toes, hoping for the government's new plan. The prohibition policy should start in Anhui. At the same time, we also hope that the government will severely punish the opium dens in the evil concessions to eliminate the source. The people are fortunate, and the international community is fortunate. The Anhui Association in Shanghai bows in submission. (2) To Chairman Chen of the Anhui Provincial Government: The rumor of opium monopoly is rampant, causing widespread opposition among the people. Since the Central Government has not explicitly ordered a public sale, it will of course implement the policy of prohibition. Anhui was already a prohibited province in the second year of the Republic of China (1913). Since then, there have been successive disturbances. Not only have government orders been abolished, but opium has also spread. Foreigners regard us as an opium-producing area, which is extremely shameful. We earnestly request that you comply with the Prime Minister's legacy of opium prohibition, giving the people a way to rehabilitate themselves. Local officials, such as county governments and public security bureaus, are most likely to harbor evil. They should be strictly investigated. If there are any violations of the opium prohibition, they should be dismissed and punished. The people should also be allowed to file accusations in accordance with the complaint procedures in order to purify the officialdom and clean up the government. The country is fortunate, and the people are fortunate. The Anhui Association in Shanghai bows in submission.</p>
<h3>New Sassoon &amp; Co. Sues Tenants in Qingyun Lane</h3>
<p>▲ Lawsuit to Recover Unpaid Rent and Evict Tenants</p>
<p>▲ 164 Households Sued</p>
<p>▲ Court Schedules Daily Hearings Due to Large Number of Defendants</p>
<p>▲ Lawyer Xue Corrects Legal Procedures</p>
<p>The properties in Qingyun Lane, North Sichuan Road, are owned by the British firm New Sassoon &amp; Co. The buildings were constructed only thirteen or fourteen years ago and are not yet considered old. Last summer, the company notified the tenants to vacate the premises for demolition and reconstruction. However, the 164 households refused, reasoning that rents would inevitably increase after the renovation. As the houses were not damaged and provided sufficient shelter from the wind and rain, they requested the landlord to postpone the demolition and offered to pay slightly higher rents. The landlord refused and hired over two hundred White Russians to demolish the houses. The tenants, greatly angered, accused the company's comprador, Xing Dingcheng, of instigating the matter and sued him in the Special District Court. The criminal court found the accusations unsubstantiated and acquitted Xing. The tenants appealed to the High Court, which upheld the original verdict. However, since the lawsuit began, the tenants had not paid their monthly rent, and New Sassoon had not sent anyone to collect it, resulting in arrears of seven or eight months as of the end of January. The company has now sued the 164 households in the Special Court for unpaid rent and is seeking a court order for their eviction. Judge Zhou Daren is presiding over the case. Due to the large number of defendants, Judge Zhou has divided them into four groups, with forty-one households summoned for trial each day, starting yesterday morning, for four consecutive days. The tenants were initially unaware of this arrangement, so almost all of them appeared in court for the first hearing yesterday morning. At 9:30 a.m., Judge Zhou took his seat in the Ninth Civil Court and announced the division of trials into batches. He then instructed the plaintiff's lawyer, Mr. Goodfellow, to present the case. According to the lawyer's translation, the Qingyun Lane area where the properties are located has become increasingly prosperous in recent years. The existing old-fashioned houses are out of place, so the landlord decided to renovate. On June 25th of last year, seventy-seven households were notified to move out by the end of August, and the remaining tenants were notified by the end of August to move out by the end of October. However, the tenants refused to move out and also failed to pay their rent. Article 450 of the Civil Code stipulates that a lease without a fixed term can be terminated at any time, provided that one month's notice is given to the tenant. The plaintiff gave two months' notice but the tenants still occupied the properties. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed. Mr. Sherman of New Sassoon &amp; Co. testified that he was in charge of real estate at the company. Some of the houses were built seventeen years ago, and some fourteen years ago. They now wanted to demolish and rebuild, so they needed to take back the properties. Old tenants would have priority in renting the new buildings, but this case was not foreseeable. The tenants who were summoned stated that they should pay the rent, but unanimously refused to move out, and retained lawyer Yan Jiaqi for their defense. Lawyer Yan presented three points for the court to decide first: (1) The amounts of unpaid rent claimed by the plaintiff, such as those from Qiantai Xing Senji, exceeded one or two thousand yuan, which constitutes a district-level case, while the remaining debts were less than one thousand yuan, which constitutes an elementary-level case. Now they are jointly sued, without distinguishing the levels, violating the legal procedure. Moreover, cases of the elementary level, since January 1st of this year, should first go through mediation, but the plaintiff has not made such a request, and instead directly filed a joint lawsuit, which clearly violates the law. (2) New Sassoon &amp; Co. is not registered in China and is therefore not a legal person. Therefore, its lawsuit should be represented by a manager. According to Xing Dingcheng's previous testimony, the company's general manager is named David and the second manager is named Collaco. There was no mention of Sherman. Sherman's qualification to represent the lawsuit still needs to be examined. (3) Some of the defendants are business names, but the plaintiff only sued the business names and not the managers. This is also illegal. Furthermore, there are many errors among the defendants, such as minors, mismatched names, or names with only a surname or only a given name. All these three points relate to legal procedure and should be decided first before proceeding with other matters. Judge Zhou stated that he would consider the arguments on the level of trial and resolve them together, without making a decision first. He instructed the plaintiff's lawyer to correct the names listed in the complaint and asked Sherman to provide evidence of representation. The court was adjourned to March 23rd for debate. It was already past noon. The second batch of forty-one tenants will be summoned for trial this morning.</p>
<h3>Rain and Snow Damage Vegetables</h3>
<p>▲ Vegetable Prices in the Market Are Extremely High</p>
<p>Since the continuous rain and snow at the beginning of last month, followed by severe cold and heavy snow, the vegetables in the fields of nearby villages have been frozen and withered, unable to grow, almost completely destroyed. As a result, there is a sudden shortage of all kinds of vegetables in the markets of this city, and the prices of the few available are doubled. At the most expensive time, each catty of cauliflower was sold for 1,400 cash. Although it has been slightly cheaper in recent days, it still costs 600 cash per catty. Green vegetables have completely disappeared. Spinach currently costs 400 cash per catty, and celery costs 300 cash per catty. Moreover, the taste is not very palatable after cooking. According to someone from a vegetable shop in western Shanghai, the vegetables in the fields from both sides of Caojiadu to the west to Beixinjing, Huacao, and Zhenru are almost completely withered and disappeared. Only a small number of vegetables near the houses of villagers are slightly damaged and can be sold in the market. Therefore, western Shanghai has become a vegetable desert. Considering this area alone, the loss is estimated to be about 200,000 yuan. The villagers who rely on these vegetable gardens for a living are crying out in distress. Furthermore, the wheat and rapeseed in the villages will be greatly reduced in yield due to the impact of the snow and frost.</p>
<p>There is still snow accumulated in the fields, and the ice has not melted.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance Implements Collection of House Tax on Roads in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The roads in western Shanghai, such as Robison Road, Caojiadu, Great Western Road, Zhoujiaqiao, etc., were built by the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council outside the boundary of the International Settlement. The taxes of businesses and residents were also collected by the Council. Since the establishment of police stations by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Bureau of Finance, in order to recover rights and interests, sent personnel to collect the general tax from merchants and residents on these roads a few years ago. However, the merchants and residents believed that one business could not afford two taxes, so it was not implemented. It is now learned that the Municipal Bureau of Finance has decided to implement the collection of taxes since all sanitation construction on the roads in western Shanghai has been carried out in order. Recently, personnel have been sent to investigate rents as a preparation for the work. The proclamation issued by the Bureau of Finance is recorded below: Proclamation: It has been found that police substations have been established on Robison Road, Caojiadu, Great Western Road, Zhoujiaqiao, etc., by the Public Security Bureau, and the residents have been given considerable protection. All construction has been carried out actively, and the collection of taxes is the duty of the residents. It has now been decided to implement the collection immediately. In addition to sending a letter to the Public Security Bureau to instruct the police stations in the relevant areas to provide assistance when personnel from this bureau go to investigate rents, this proclamation is issued to inform all merchants and residents. When an investigation is carried out, the latest rent receipt or lease should be shown, and do not deliberately disobey. Sincerely, this proclamation.</p>

<h3>Impersonating National Government Secretary to Kidnap Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>▲ Li Zonghua Impersonates Li Pan</p>
<p>▲ Conspiring Against Luo Baoqiang</p>
<p>▲ Sumptuous Meal at Da San Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Preparing Car to Meet Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Detective Suddenly Arrives, Throws Him in Jail for Two Months, Still Not Convinced</p>
<p>Luo Baoqiang, a Cantonese native, has been running a sugar business in Cuba. He has considerable influence in the Cuban business community. Seeing that the motherland has been unified and politics are gradually becoming clear, he invited several comrades to raise foreign capital and start industries in the country. After returning to Shanghai, he stayed at the Dadong Hotel to discuss matters with the relevant government agencies. On the 20th of this month, Li Zonghua, impersonating National Government Secretary Li Pan (i.e., Li Xiangen), visited Luo at the hotel, intending to defraud him of money or kidnap him for ransom. Wei Jun discovered this and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Li was arrested at the Dadong Hotel billiard room around 7:00 p.m. on the 22nd. He was sent to the Special District Court for trial yesterday morning. The process of this event is of journalistic value, so the details and the court's verdict are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>▲ Overseas Party Member. Luo Baoqiang is from Taishan, Guangdong. He has been doing business in Cuba, America. Luo is a member of the Kuomintang. In addition to doing business, he also handles overseas party affairs. Therefore, Luo has considerable influence not only in the business community in Cuba, but also in overseas party affairs. Last year, Luo, seeing that the motherland had been unified, invited several comrades to form a sugar company in order to operate a sugar business in the country.</p>
<p>▲ Sugar Company. The sugar company organized by Luo raised capital of ten million US dollars. Most of this capital was invested by foreign merchants. It was a plan to use foreign capital to start industries in the motherland. After the organization was established, the organization plan was forwarded by the Cuban minister Ling Bing to the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Minister Kong replied that it was adopted and invited Luo back to the country to discuss the matter in person. Luo received the telegram and returned to the country with four Cubans (i.e., an economic delegation). He arrived in Shanghai on November 4th last year and went to Nanjing to meet with Minister Kong. He returned to Shanghai on December 7th and stayed at the Dadong Hotel on the second floor, waiting for the government's approval.</p>
<p>▲ Uninvited Guest. Around 3:00 p.m. on February 20th of this year, Li Zonghua, impersonating National Government Secretary Li Pan, visited Luo at the Dadong Hotel. After the meeting, Li Zonghua said, "I am Secretary Li of Chairman Chiang. I was introduced by your friend Huang Dingzhi (who is indeed a friend of Luo and now works in the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission) to Shanghai to contact you about the sugar company." He also said that people in Nanjing were well aware of this large-scale plan and asked about its progress. Luo replied that it would be successful soon. Li said that the matter could not be expedited unless he personally met with Chairman Chiang. Luo replied that this type of industrial plan did not seem to require bothering Chairman Chiang. The relevant departments of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce could handle it fully. Li said, "If you see Chairman Chiang, this matter can be successful immediately, and I can do my best to introduce you. Chairman Chiang trusts me very much. Our relationship is like his right and left hands. I am good at writing and calligraphy, and I can write with both hands."</p>
<p>▲ Becoming Suspicious. At this point, Luo saw that his words were inappropriate and knew that he was definitely not Secretary Li Pan. Luo took the opportunity to ask him to write with his left hand. He was indeed able to write freely, and his brushwork was quite vigorous. At four o'clock, Luo asked him to leave his Nanjing address. The address he wrote was consistent with the residence of Secretary Li, but around six o'clock, Luo asked if he had had dinner. Li replied that he had not. Luo invited him to dinner at Da San Yuan on Nanjing Road. Two of Luo's friends also went with them. Before leaving, Li suddenly said that he was very sorry that the free train ticket he had brought to Shanghai had been lost. He asked to borrow five yuan for his train fare back to Nanjing tonight. He would send it back to Shanghai immediately. Luo gave him five yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Sumptuous Meal. At this point, Luo knew that he was a scoundrel, but he did not want to expose him, but still treated him with kindness. He went to Da San Yuan with him and they had a sumptuous meal. After eating, Li again said that Chairman Chiang was coming to Shanghai on Wednesday. He had to return to Nanjing tonight so that he could come with the Chairman on Wednesday. After arriving in Nanjing, he would send a letter to Luo first on Monday. Luo replied that this was good, and said that he would go to the station to send his friend Mr. Mo tonight. Mr. Mo went secretly to the North Station to investigate whether he boarded the train. The result was that he was not there.</p>
<p>▲ Second Visit. At 2:30 p.m. on the 22nd, the man went to the Dadong Hotel again for a second visit. However, Luo had moved from the second floor to the fourth floor. Li Zonghua waited in the billiard room downstairs because it was the route for guests of the Dadong Hotel to enter and exit. Around 5:00 p.m., Luo's friend Mr. Mo returned from outside. Li saw Mr. Mo and asked him where Mr. Luo was. Mr. Mo replied that he did not know, but said that he could call his friend to inquire and asked him to wait. Mr. Mo went upstairs to inform Luo, and then went downstairs to tell Li that Mr. Luo was coming soon and asked him to wait. He was also being polite and perfunctory. Meanwhile, Luo notified the cashier to report to the Lao Zha Police Station. At this time, Li said to Mr. Mo that he had three friends waiting together, and there was a car waiting outside the door. Because the Chairman had arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Luo had to come quickly, otherwise the Chairman would not be able to wait long.</p>
<p>▲ Detectives Suddenly Arrive. After receiving the report, the police station sent many Chinese and foreign detectives. Suddenly, they sealed off the billiard room, prohibiting everyone from moving and ordering everyone to raise their hands. The situation was serious and solemn. All the billiard guests were terrified and looked at each other in dismay. Mr. Mo pointed out Li Zonghua and said that there were three accomplices. At this time, three onlookers were sitting on the same chair as Li, and the detectives arrested Li Zonghua and the other three together. Luo also went along. After the police chief interrogated them, the other three were released because they were not involved. Li was detained. Li confessed at the police station that his real name was Li Zhongyue, and that he had been Secretary Wu Peifu. He was from Fujian.</p>
<p>▲ Sentenced to Two Months. The police station sent him to the Special District Court for trial at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Luo also went to court to testify. Judge Luo opened the sixth court to interrogate him. Li confessed that he was selling calligraphy at the Dadong Hotel. Luo Baoqiang pitied his poverty, gave him five yuan, and invited him to dinner. He did not defraud him, and he was poorly dressed. How could he impersonate the Chairman's Secretary? After the interrogation, Judge Luo sentenced him to two months imprisonment on the charge of fraud. However, Li Zonghua stated in court that he did not agree and prepared to appeal.</p>
<h3>French Concession Limits Deadline for Submitting Shareholder List of Gongfa Company</h3>
<p>▲ Catalogue of Huang Chujiu’s Assets</p>
<p>▲ Order to Report Within Three Days</p>
<p>After the Riyue Bank and Dashijie Amusement Department, founded by Huang Chujiu, went bankrupt after Huang Chujiu's death, the creditors sued in the French Concession Court. Yesterday was the date for the fourth continued hearing of the case. First, accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang said that they were ordered to liquidate and register. More than 15,000 households have registered. The total amount of debt owed to Riyue Bank and Dashijie Amusement Department is just over 2,000 yuan. They have already asked lawyer Tan to find a way to hand over Huang's assets as soon as possible. The hot spring bathhouses in the five shops under the Gongfa Company have been offered a price of 50,000 yuan. After repaying the security deposit, there will still be 40,000 yuan left. Fuchang Company owes Riyue Bank 890,000 yuan. If it is offered to someone, after returning other debts, there will still be 400,000 yuan left. The amount owed by the Zhongxi Pharmacy, if it is offered to someone, can get more than 200,000 yuan, which is enough to cover the debt. If Dashijie is offered to someone, it can get more than 1 million yuan. If it is rented to someone, it can get 100,000 yuan per year. After removing the security deposit, it can get 60,000 yuan, paying two years' rent in advance, totaling 120,000 yuan. However, Dashijie still has 29 years of lease term. The operating losses over the years have reached 270,000 yuan. If there is still not enough, the shareholders will be pursued for compensation. Then, lawyer Wu Zhiping, the legal advisor of Fuchang Company, and Min Caizhang, the manager of Dashijie, reported everything, which was similar to what the accountant Wu said. Then, lawyer Bian Jialu said that Riyue Bank and Dashijie Savings Department had been bankrupt for more than a month, and most of the creditors were poor people. They must seek to end it as soon as possible. He also requested that Huang's family transfer the owed money first so that it could be distributed. Most of the staff in Dashijie were Huang's family members, and the accounts were easy to cheat. He requested permission for the creditors to send people to supervise. Then, lawyer Zhou Xiao'an said that the shareholder register was extremely important in future liquidation. To this day, the names of the shareholders are still not clear. He observed that accountant Xu Yongzuo replied to accountants Pan and Wu on February 5, saying, "After checking this stock bottom sample and shareholder register, our accountants attended the post-mortem committee, and although we had a glimpse, our accountants did not keep it for safekeeping." It can be seen that the shareholder register is still in the hands of the post-mortem committee. In order to prevent the evidence from being destroyed and the creditors from being in danger, the court should give instructions to the committee, limiting them to hand over the case within three days to protect the creditors and facilitate liquidation. Then, Xu Yannian said that although Huang's property in this case was being liquidated by Tan Yigong, a list had not yet been submitted to the court, nor had it been reported to the accountants. He was very suspicious of this point, and requested that the court order lawyer Tan to report as soon as possible. Lawyer Bian Jialu also said that there was now a receipt from Yuan Ludeng, the supervising director of Gongfa Company, requesting that Yuan be summoned to the case, so that the names of the shareholders in this case could be clarified. Then, lawyer Yan Luqing said that the shareholder register of Gongfa Company was probably hidden by the manager of Riyue Bank, and requested that the court order the manager to hand it over, otherwise he should be bailed or arrested. At this point, Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer representing Chen Zhiquan, the manager of Riyue Bank, said that lawyer Yan could not request the case with speculative words. In short, the shareholder register should be pursued to the shareholders' meeting. Then, lawyers Chen Zhigao and Dong Chi said that the total amount owed by Riyue Bank Dashijie Savings Department was more than one million yuan. Since the announcement of liquidation, the accountants have collected very little from the debtors, which is very inappropriate, and should be ordered to pursue them as soon as possible. Lawyers Dong Yu, Lu Jiazi and others made statements on their behalf. Judge Gong Cheng ordered that, according to the plaintiffs' request, Huang Chujiu's family should be ordered to submit the catalogue of property within three days, and that the Gongfa Company shareholders' meeting should be ordered to submit the list of shareholders to the court within three days. Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang should follow the court's instructions and submit it for verification.</p>
<h3>Earth Guardian's Married Sister Sues for Division of Inheritance</h3>
<p>▲ Earth Guardian Claims Sister is Not Father's Child</p>
<p>▲ Sister Claims Earth Guardian is Adopted</p>
<p>▲ Wood Tablet and Wedding Invitation Presented in Court</p>
<p>▲ Sister Requests Payment of 50,000 Yuan First</p>
<p>Earth guardian Wang Jinlan has a sister who is married to coppersmith Shen Linsheng. After Wang's father passed away, he left an estate of 200,000 yuan, mostly land. At the time, his sister wanted to share it, but Wang asked to postpone the discussion so that the estate could increase. In recent years, land prices have soared, and Wang's property has increased accordingly. Fearing that his sister would bring up the old matter again, he asked his sister to move elsewhere. Shen Wang's sister then asked lawyer Zhan Jifeng to send a letter to Wang Jinlan, formally proposing the division of the property. Wang also hired lawyer Tao Jiachun to reply, denying that he had such a sister. Shen Wang's sister then filed a lawsuit for division of the property in the Special District Court, stating that before the exact amount of the inheritance was ascertained, she requested that the defendant be ordered to pay 50,000 yuan first. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou summoned the case for trial. According to Shen Wang's sister's complaint, she heard from her late father that the defendant was not his biological child, but an adopted child. She and the plaintiff, however, were brother and sister. The earth guardian argued that the plaintiff was born to the son-in-law of his maternal uncle, and was not named Wang. That the one she was married to was also not named Shen, but Zhou. At this time the plaintiff's husband, Shen Linsheng, came to court to say that he was indeed named Shen. Then lawyer Zhan presented the late father's memorial tablet, saying if the plaintiff was not Wang Yunzhai's daughter, then why would the memorial tablet be at the plaintiff's home, and that at the wedding, the wedding invitation was written and signed by the defendant. Next a worn out red wedding invitation was shown. Judge Zhou ordered the defendant to write the characters so the writing could be compared. Finally, after a debate by the defendant's lawyer, the court adjourned and said that the verdict would be announced on the morning of the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Fan A'bao Accuses Zeng Ni Liujie of Seizing Property</h3>
<p>丨Master-Servant Romance Produces Two Sons and Two Daughters丨</p>
<p>▲Ni Guangdong Flees and Doesn't Return</p>
<p>▲Ni Liujie Seizes Property and Refuses to Hand It Over</p>
<p>Fan A'bao, a woman from Changshu, is currently twenty-nine years old. When she was twenty years old, she went to work as a domestic servant at the home of Ni Wenbing, a Fujianese man who worked at the customs office at 748 Dixiwei Road in the Chinese-controlled area (formerly existing, now deceased). She then developed a romantic relationship with Ni Guangxun, the third son of Ni. Before long, she was dismissed by her employer, and so she established a small family elsewhere. Nine years have passed, and she has given birth to four children. Now, Fan A'bao has hired lawyer Yu Hualong to sue Zeng Ni Liujie (an employee of the Meiyi Company on Jing'an Temple Road, wife of a Mr. Zeng), the sister of Ni Guangxun, in the local court for seizing the family property and refusing to hand it over, requesting its return. Her statement roughly stated that since the plaintiff and Ni Guangxun formed a family and lived together, nine years have passed, and their love has been very close, with no discord. Therefore, over several years, she has given birth to two sons and two daughters, the oldest being eight years old and the youngest only a few months old (with photos to prove it). When Guangxun was at home, he cared for them all, except for the youngest who had not yet been born. The incident arose on the thirteenth day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar last year, when Guangxun, at the instigation of the defendant, unexpectedly left without saying goodbye in the dark of night. Several months have passed since then, and there has been no news. His whereabouts are unknown. The plaintiff was suddenly faced with this unexpected event, and her heart is broken. She looks around, bewildered, and has no one to turn to for help. Furthermore, Guangxun had no remaining family funds when he left, resulting in a lack of resources, and the young children have been crying for food for more than a day. In addition, the plaintiff is pregnant and about to give birth, making the difficulty of raising them even greater. This situation is unbearable for a weak woman. However, Guangdong was wealthy, and his inheritance from his father was quite substantial (about 25,000 gold). Because Guangxun was still young when the inheritance was received, it was all deposited with the defendant, entrusting her to manage it on his behalf. Guangxun had said this clearly when he was at home. Now that Guangxun has left, how can the young children be allowed to go hungry and cold? For the sake of survival, the plaintiff has repeatedly asked the defendant to return the Ni family's entrusted property in order to provide for her livelihood, and she has been mediated by others. The defendant also admitted to allocating 1,000 yuan, but this meager amount is not enough for the plaintiff and her five children to live on, so she did not agree to it. When the plaintiff had no other choice, she hired a lawyer to send a letter of demand, but the defendant refused on various pretexts. Her malice in coveting the property and intending to seize it is extremely obvious. The plaintiff cannot stand by and watch Guangxun's children suffer from hunger and cold. Therefore, she has laid out the facts and earnestly requests the court to show compassion for the weak and young, and to order the defendant to hand over all of Guangxun's deposited property in order to ensure their livelihood and protect their legal rights, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Qufei specially opened the Fourth Tribunal for the trial. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, Ni Fan A'bao, brought her two sons and two daughters and her lawyer, Mr. Yu, to the court. The judge briefly asked the plaintiff about her age and origin, and asked, "Who is Ni Guangxun to you?" The plaintiff replied, "He is my husband, and we are a married couple." The judge said, "The defendant's address is in the concession area, which is not under the jurisdiction of this court. This court will transfer the case to the special court for investigation."

<h3>Robbery with Gunfire on Avenue Sa Po Sa Yesterday Evening, Two Injured</h3>
<p>At 8:35 PM last night, at the home of Chen Yundu, a Fujianese man at 101 Avenue Sa Po Sa in the French Concession (Chen, 51 years old, Fujianese, born in French Annam since childhood, now running a wine shop at 101), six robbers suddenly arrived, wearing blue cloth long and short jackets. One robber, holding a gun, entered first, shouting to silence everyone. At that time, Chen was playing mahjong in the parlor with Mao A'gen and Chen Xingfu, two Ningbo natives who lived next door at 99 and worked in the woodworking industry (Chen Xingfu, 26 years old, previously a tailor, also lived at 99), and Lu Fusheng, a butcher shop worker from 148 Ximen Road, and an old woman surnamed Tang, a neighbor from 99, was sitting at the entrance. When the robbers rushed into the parlor, they immediately cocked their pistols, loaded the bullets, and ordered everyone to remain silent. Seeing the situation was bad, Chen and the others all stood up to resist. The robber with the gun then opened fire on Chen and the others, hitting Chen's left shinbone and neighbor Chen Xingfu's right thigh and groin. Seeing that they had injured the victims, the robbers dared not linger to rob and fled in a chaotic rush. The victim then reported the incident to the Songshan Road Police Station. Upon hearing the news, the police chief immediately dispatched detectives to investigate and sent the two injured men to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injuries of both men are minor and not life-threatening.</p>
<h3>The Sudden Rise of Rickshaw Advertising</h3>
<p>▲An Unprecedented Innovation on the Sea</p>
<p>▲Good News for More Than 10,000 Poor Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>The Baigao Advertising Agency at 36 Renji Road, recognizing the rapid development of the advertising industry, has pioneered the newest and most innovative rickshaw hood advertising. The far-reaching effectiveness and the deep impression it will leave on people are self-evident. The details of the agency's active efforts are described below:</p>
<p>▲Motivation for Launching the Initiative Since the introduction of rickshaws to the sea, there have been twenty years of history. More than 8,000 rickshaws operate in the city, providing a livelihood for more than 10,000 poor and struggling people. They are divided into day and night shifts, running all day in wind, snow, and rain, and their suffering is unspeakable. Last year, Feng Bingnan, a prominent figure in the Shanghai business community, felt compassion and published an opinion in the "Zi Lin Western Newspaper," expressing his sympathy for these poor rickshaw pullers. He took the lead in establishing the Rickshaw Pullers' Gospel Society, making a clarion call that resulted in a righteous cause. At the same time, he proposed that advertisements could be placed on the rickshaw itself, such as on the wheel guards and the back of the car, and that ten percent of the profits could be used to help the elderly and infirm rickshaw pullers. His intentions were both comprehensive and thoughtful. The agency's motivation for launching this initiative is based on this, and it has asked Mr. Feng Bingnan for guidance. ▲Great Efforts Made The agency, led by Wu Linjiang and others, has been preparing for more than three months, making every effort to carry out the project. It has created this newest form of advertising, never before seen on the sea. The hood used has undergone a series of scientific studies and is made entirely of canvas. It is installed on the rickshaw hood and is both beautiful in style and easy to install. The position for placing the advertisement is on the front of the back of the hood, with a blank space of 28 inches wide and 7 inches high. The advertisement is placed on top, and whether it is parked on the street or running on the street, it is clear at a glance and attracts attention. When it rains, the hood is turned up, and the front of the hood sits high on the top, with another blank space on the back for displaying the same advertisement. Therefore, regardless of whether it is raining, day or night, the advertisement can be seen all over the city and is visible everywhere. Moreover, rickshaws travel everywhere, through large streets and small alleys, reaching everywhere. Its effectiveness is truly a magical power beyond imagination. It is reported that a large exhibition will be held soon in the city, and the sudden rise of this new form of advertising will surely cause a sensation throughout Shanghai.</p>

However, the entire car body was reduced to ashes, and the loft floor and walls were also affected.</p>

<h3>A Record of Old Feelings at Dinghu Yi Bing Zi Zai</h3>
<p>Yesterday I passed by Maple Garden. Hong Shu showed me a scroll of "Records of Old Feelings at Dinghu". The painting was over three zhang long and was exquisitely made. It was painted by Zheng Wuchang as a commemoration of his close friend, Yi Bing. Yi Bing was from Jianhu and grew up in Linghai. She graduated from the Guangdong Women's Normal School. She was skilled in art, capable of writing, and had a noble character, looking down on the masses. At the age of twenty-five, she had not yet married. Relatives and friends advised her to marry, but she simply smiled and dismissed it. After meeting Hong Shu, they became friends at first sight and were as happy as if they had known each other their whole lives. Although Hong Shu had unspeakable personal troubles, Miss Wei was determined to associate with him. They enjoyed discussing literature and poetry. Later, due to other reasons, they parted ways midway. They missed each other in two places, and all they had was lonely poetry and books. Hong Shu cherished the memory of the past and painted the picture to express his feelings of longing. He could not help but feel like a wild goose flying at the end of the sky. Wuchang wrote in his inscription on the painting: "Miss Wei of Jianhu was exceptionally beautiful and intelligent and had a literary relationship with Hong Shu. However, due to environmental constraints, they parted ways midway. Miss Wei, though her wish was unfulfilled, remained determined. She was sad and lost her soul, and drifted far away. Hong Shu was also dispirited as if he had lost something. He went east to the sea, and when he occasionally spoke of the past, he would shed tears. He especially remembered the events at Dinghu in the late spring of Rensu. He then asked me to paint this picture to express his hidden resentment. I think of my deceased friend, Miss Yin Xian. The grass on her grave in Nanping is now nine years old. Loving couples are destined to be envied by heaven. Hong Shu and Miss Wei, although drifting to the corners of the sea and the ends of the earth, may eventually meet. Compared with life and death, Dinghu Mountain is high, but perhaps not as deep as West Lake." Before the painting, Yu Youren wrote the title, and Huang Huiwen inscribed the frame. The inscriptions and poems by Fei Zhongshen, Zhu Zhenzhuang, Liu San, Tan Pingzhai, Wang Luyi, Yao Mangfu, Jin Xihou, Yi Da, Jiang Jingan, Wang Qiuzhai, Pan Lanshi, Huang Binhong, and Liu Yazi further enhanced its value.

<h3>Burglar-Proof Car ·Lu·Bing</h3>
<p>A young British inventor named Feilanluo has a car equipped with burglar-proof devices. If a thief is not self-aware and attempts to steal the car, he only needs to touch the car, and it will automatically emit strange noises, as if clearly telling passersby that the car is being stolen. In short, even the most skilled thief cannot get his hands on Fei's car.</p>
<p>The Scottish court recently put a car with burglar-proof devices to the test. Everyone from the court was present, as was Fei. Fei first spoke, saying that this car was no different from ordinary cars, but it could prevent theft. The audience did not believe him and asked to try it. A detective came forward and tried to open the car door with extremely careful movements. Unexpectedly, as soon as he moved it slightly, a strange noise rang out, causing him to be startled and step back. Another detective claimed that he only needed to completely cut off the wires leading to the loudspeaker on the iron mesh to be safe. However, as soon as the car cover was opened and he was about to cut the wires, the sound rang out again. It is said that the above invention will be used on postal cars to ensure the safety of mail delivery.</p>
<h3>World Small Records ·Hai·Ke</h3>
<p>▲One year, in Fude Fort, Germany, a concert was held. Admission required a fee of ten marks. If you didn't have money, you could pay with two eggs, because eggs were extremely scarce at that time.</p>
<p>▲There is a policeman in London who has been serving since 1875 and is still on the job today. He has been working for more than 50 years and can be said to be the only old policeman in the world.</p>
<p>▲A famous British doctor declared, "People often think that overwork is enough to cause injury. But that's not the case. The fatal injury lies in excessive worry and anxiety."</p>
<p>▲An American female millionaire traveled to Europe. Her luggage consisted of eighty large boxes. When transported from Paris, France, to England, the import tax paid amounted to as much as one thousand gold pounds. Those who heard about it were amazed.</p>
<p>▲In Ilwas, Middlesex, England, 240 pounds of honey were found in a cottage, stored in the ceiling of the room. Storing such a large amount of honey in one place is still a first.</p>
<p>▲According to a 1922 survey, the military aircraft of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States numbered 378 in the UK, 537 in the US, and 2,520 in France, the most of any country. In recent years, the three countries have built many more. British aviators are emerging in large numbers and are working even harder.</p>
<p>▲In the city of Mendes, England, there are many factories and chimneys, so coal smoke flies everywhere. The annual loss due to coal smoke is about one million gold pounds.</p>
<p>Inscriptions. Lu Bicheng's tune of "Touching Fish" in the style of London Fort's Ancient Rhyme. Intricate and melancholy, it is recorded below. Remembering the beautiful scenery of Nantian Lake and mountains, Xiang strings and silk were once played. At that time, who would have expected such a light departure, singing the red beans of love everywhere. Fate is sudden. What can be done when the dream is shattered and the lamp is extinguished, and it is difficult to save your slender hand. The mountain alliance and sea oath are remembered, driving in the same car, Qing Cong side by side. Playing happily on the ninth day of the third month. The storm is urgent. What can be done when it is time to fly separately. The secret agreement is finally broken. Eyebrows thousands of miles away are thrown to the wasteland to die. Good dreams are hard to come true. Traces fill the sleeves. Draw a picture that is real and true, which can be worth a thousand poems. Is repentance tender? Where to bury sorrow? Sing wildly when crying. I am willing to be the descendant of Li Sao. Hong Shu also has a chapter of ancient style, lingering and touching, with both sorrow and gorgeousness. The poem says, "Dinghu Mountain, the mountain scenery is beautiful. Once illuminated the graceful appearance of a beauty. Why today call Zhenzhen, only a sad draft remains. The beauty is a daughter of a great family. Silk years of age recognize scriptures and history. Leading the spring breeze, many peach and plum. Embroidered mandarin ducks from the beginning for you. Remember the past, Xingyan, holding hands to play. One hill and one ravine explored exhaustively. Climbing to the highest point every time. The mundane world looks down empty and leisurely. Empty and leisurely, the clouds and water flow. I walk the Xiphe you south tour. Until the bird barbarian flowers are not enough words. I vow to grow old in the hot state. Sigh, when will the mundane fate end? Suddenly see the frost and sun hibiscus withered. Check the Qingxiang old things survive. Daily stroking to forget the dim dawn. Stroking, stroking, many sorrows. There is another hidden feeling to call what to do. The shark silk scarf is full of tear marks. There is a heart fragrance that has never been erased. The Zhongyi gifted to warm the body and mind. One needle and one thread to measure the length. The length is hate. The shortness is the fate of heaven. Alas, the lack of love in the sky. Nuwa fills it. The sea of hate is deep. Jingwei blocks it. Only this hate remains forever. Only with a piece of paper to tell the hard heart. Hard heart, hard heart, I fail you. We look forward to the secret agreement to keep the ancient. A deep affection, I can't bear to finish reading."</p>
<h3>Dog Matchmaker Chen Shuping</h3>
<p>Dogs lying on the streets in the capital are everywhere. Although the Social Affairs Bureau once cracked down on them, ordering dog owners to go to the bureau to register and obtain a copper tag to hang on the dog's neck to distinguish it from wild dogs, no one took responsibility and the search was ineffective, so there was little success. In addition, many owners believe that dogs have a duty to guard the house, so they often keep them outside the door. These dogs then occupy the streets as their beds, and pedestrians often have the feeling that they cannot walk. The worst is the area around Gu Yi Lang, which is known as a village of vicious dogs, obstructing traffic, which can be seen in a glimpse.</p>
<p>One autumn night, the weather was cloudy. A fashionable girl with short hair, wearing high-heeled leather shoes, was returning from a banquet at Qi's house. Because there were no vehicles on the street, she had to walk. She was walking out of Mufu West Gate when she suddenly kicked something. It was as soft as cotton. The thing that was kicked suddenly jumped up, leaped over the girl's head, and made a strange noise. The girl was caught off guard and fainted in shock. At that time, Wen You Qing Hesheng happened to be passing by. He saw everything and quickly rushed forward to help the girl up and took her to a nearby dumpling and noodle shop. He asked for开water and gave it to the girl to wake her up. After asking, he learned that the girl's surname was Hu. She was from a prominent family in Jinling. She lived in Beimen Bridge. Qing Hesheng hired a car for her and accompanied her home. Her father now works in a certain institution. He has only this precious daughter under his knees and cherishes her more than anything else. He was grateful for Qing Hesheng's rescue. The next day, he specially held a banquet for Qing Hesheng to express his gratitude. In the middle of the wine, they talked happily. Qing Hesheng described that his family had a foreign goods shop. He graduated from a certain middle school and is now a teacher at a certain school. He lacks a suitable partner, so he still needed a wife. He revealed his intention to propose marriage. Although the girl's father did not agree in words, he already agreed in his heart. A few days later, Qing Hesheng asked a matchmaker to go back and forth to persuade him, and a good marriage was concluded. A wedding ceremony was held at a certain large hotel a few days ago. During the banquet, the guests urged the groom to tell his love story. Qing Hesheng firmly refused. Later, Mr. Zhang told it for him. The concluding sentence was, "The combination of the two can be said to be due to the dog's matchmaking." When the introducer heard this, he felt embarrassed and couldn't stop. It can be said to be fun.</p>
<h3>New Trends in Sound Films Miaozi</h3>
<p>There is a question that can give movie fans new considerations: "Which is better, sound films or silent films?"</p>
<p>Many people oppose sound films, believing that silent films have a "silent beauty." The actions on the screen do not really need sound to match them. The king of slapstick, Charlie Chaplin, once said, "The birth of sound films is the beginning of the failure of the art of cinema."</p>
<p>Many people also praise sound films, believing that sound films are indeed a special advancement in the film industry. The complex replaces the monotonous, the concrete replaces the abstract. Emotions are more harmonious because of sound, and actions are more intimate because of sound. Everything presents an absolute naturalness. Unlike silent films, which always make people feel empty.</p>
<p>Now, I don't need to explain which theory is correct. However, we know that sound films are not in opposition to silent films. Its subject is still the same as silent films, which is the plot of the film. Sound is only an accessory. Recently, an article by Dr. Mailun was published in an American film review magazine, which can well explain this point. He said, "Stage plays are stage plays, and films are films. If American film companies abandon the advantages of their previous silent films and want to use stage plays and song and dance as the central material for new sound films, then sound films will inevitably fail. What we want is that those who produce sound films should not make "sound" their first object. A tortuous plot and deep expression are still necessary conditions for sound films, and "sound" is only to add strength to those plots and performances.</p>
<p>Now, the film industry in Hualanwut (Hollywood) also feels this. Therefore, the sound films of 1931 are obviously different from those of 1929. So-called complete song and dance sound films are no longer common. And Lianyi Company (United Artists) actually plans to remake "Laihun" ("The Taming of the Shrew") into a new sound film. From this, it can be seen that new sound films have gained new awareness. In the realm of silver art, it will not be broken by the solid barriers of the original solid stage drama wave of song and dance.</p>
<p>Recently, the power of sound films has been unanimously praised by the film industry all over the world. In addition to the great success that the United Kingdom has already achieved, Japan also has more than ten sound films. Even in our country, although there is no official screening of sound films, the enthusiastic audience already know that a film starring Ms. Hu Die, "Song Girl Red Peony" is about to be released.</p>
<p>"Song Girl Red Peony" is completely sound. But it has not buried the advantages of silent films. Although there are many songs and dances in the film, the soul of the whole film has not been taken away by the song and dance. It has a very tortuous plot, depicting the fate of a song girl, full of the voice of the times. It has a very beautiful performance, depicting the background inside and outside the theater, exposing the cruelty of society. This is naturally a great success for sound films in our country.

<h3>Travel Notes in Southeast Asia (125 Linghua)</h3>
<p>On the twenty-fifth, I returned to Bosheng (Pathein). I passed through a county. There was no city. Most of the counties have no cities.</p>
<p>On the twenty-sixth, I arrived at Kangyidank. I was invited by the school teacher Zhang De. When I arrived, the students of the Gan Qidou Pingmin School welcomed me with a military band and cars and paraded through the city. This school has two or thirty students, mostly Lius. This village is very good. It can be called a model village. The trees are tall, averaging four or five zhang, and the shade is not hot. Facing a large river, it can be accessed by ships. It is one hour by train from Bosheng. The houses of the villagers are all good. Each is independent. It is quite suitable for hygiene. The roads are clean. Only the toilets are very inconvenient. Because of the rainy season, the ground is covered with deep water and no one cleans it. It's very bad. I gave a speech to the Chinese on national affairs.</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh morning, I gave a speech to the students. There is also a Burmese Buddhist school here, as well as a Burmese high school Aided Natlnal High School. I showed them a letter in English. The principal, U Batin, immediately ordered the class to stop. All eight classes, more than two hundred people, came to listen to my "Great Learning" speech. I spoke in English, and Wu Batin translated it into Burmese. He very much approved. There was a female teacher, Daw Hta, who introduced her friends. In the afternoon, the son of Liu Xinxin, the director of Pingmin School, was fifteen years old and very lively. He used a small boat to send me across the river for a tour. I was happy to follow. Two children paddled a small boat that was eight or nine feet long and less than two feet wide. The water was like a mirror. We traveled three or four li to the other shore. To a Chinese family, growing gardens and reed. Six Pingmin school staff. Also, one family raises seven or eight fat pigs. The hostess served Min tea and snacks to the guests. She was a Chinese woman. We can know a glimpse of the living conditions of the Chinese in various mountain villages. The houses are simple, but people told me that the residents are quite affluent. The tea from Min Anxi is very beautiful. The cups are very small, no more than wine glasses, but if it is real tea, it is very thirst-quenching. However, the tea is bad and the cups are small, which is an obstacle for the thirsty. After half an hour, the two children still took the boat to send me back. This tour was the happiest. The two children also said that there was originally no duckweed in the river. I heard it was introduced from China. It looks very good.</p>
<p>On the twenty-eighth, I arrived at Daga Xinmin School to give a speech. Zhang De and Liu Xinxin and the students, as before, escorted me with a band to the station. We also passed two shops of the Liu surname. There is also a Pengcheng Hall. Everyone sent me to Dika. There are also many Lius in Dika. I did not have time to visit. I gave a speech on the progress of China after the revolution. Everyone was happy. I returned to Bosheng in the evening.</p>
<p>On the twenty-ninth, Chen Lianqing, the manager of the Kionmangne Electric Light Company, came to talk. We talked for five hours. We agreed to talk at night. We slept until the rooster crowed. I said. This is also a Pengcheng meeting. We stayed at the Pengcheng company. Mr. Chen knows each church and Tolstoy's theory.</p>
<p>On the thirtieth, Lin Chaoying suddenly sent a letter. Mr. Chen invited me to continue the study in Gongwenya. I was happy. We went to the boat together. The normal fare is one yuan. The boat departed at twelve o'clock and arrived at Miaoyu at five o'clock. It is a big market. Mr. Feng introduced me to Qiangya School. I stayed at the 工党 (Labor Party) in the evening.</p>

<h3>Correspondence and Diagnosis by Yang Yanhe</h3>
<p>To Mr. Wen: The condition of hernia has various forms, including rushing hernia, fox hernia, epileptic hernia, fainting hernia, 疝 hernia, 瘕 hernia, 　hernia, dribbling hernia, mass hernia, cold hernia, qi hernia, ship hernia, 胕 hernia, wolf hernia, water hernia, sinew hernia, blood hernia, heart hernia, liver hernia, spleen hernia, lung hernia, kidney hernia, yin hernia, heart wind hernia, liver wind hernia, spleen wind hernia, lung wind hernia, kidney wind hernia, fox hernia wind, running piglet hernia, food accumulation hernia, rheumatic hernia, and blood stasis hernia, among other differences. Without a diagnosis of your illness, it is impossible to speculate which type it is. The common prescription for treating hernia uses lychee seeds as the main ingredient on the left side and fennel as the main ingredient on the right side. Since the illness is on the left, you can use eighteen lychee seeds (one for each year of age), roasted until brittle in a new tile,</p>
<p>grind into a powder, and take it with warm wine on an empty stomach. After the first dose, take three qian of Qiaohe pills every night. If the leucorrhea does not heal, use three qian of Fenshuixie, decoct and swallow. Other accompanying symptoms require examination and treatment.</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhu Helin: For the treatment of "embroidered ball wind" (likely scrotal eczema), use a piece of salt-containing cattail mat ("one with salt phase"), about one foot wide and long, boil it in water and wash the affected area with the water. Save the water, heat it up again, and wash again, several times a day. After washing, apply Skin Fat Powder.</p>
<p>To Mr. Shen Yunshan: Incontinence with dribbling urine is called "Lin" (strangury), while clear urination with separate impurities is called "Zhuo" (turbidity). "Lin" has qi-Lin, blood-Lin, sand-Lin, stone-Lin, ointment-Lin, cold-Lin, heat-Lin, labor-Lin, and phlegm-Lin. "Zhuo" has white turbidity, red turbidity, stool turbidity, seminal turbidity, and white emission distinctions. It cannot be generalized. The prescription copied here only promotes urination and cannot be applied to everything. A single prescription for treating "Lin" is to decoct sunflower root and drink it, but do not cook it for too long. For treating "Zhuo", crush three raw ginkgo nuts (i.e., raw white fruit) and mix with water to drink. However, although single prescriptions can sometimes have miraculous effects, they are ultimately not as reliable as prescribing according to the symptoms.</p>
