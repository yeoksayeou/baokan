<p>（東京）聞日政府已接到南京來電、要求於一星期内撤退南滿鐵路區域外之日軍、按駐日中國公使蔣作賓與幣原外相談判數日、目的在使張作相於日兵撤退後接收地方、維持治安秩序、但又無頭緒、故南京來此牒文、促其進行、現聞日本致國聨之覆文、今晚可發出、但原文須緩二三日發表、日政府除說明轟擊錦州之必要外、並謂爲保護韓人起見、不得不有此舉、且請國聨勿增進中國希望國聨干涉之意、覆文中一面聲明日本不欲要求滿洲新權利、一面說明日本依據現有條約所得之權利、應爲人所尊重云、中國方面謂日軍不撤、中國不能負維持滿洲治安秩序之責、而日本方面則謂如中國不能交出力能保護日人生命財産之確證、則日軍决不能撤退雙方相持、如蔣使與幣原議判無效則爭執非一時可了、日人以爲日軍在滿洲之行動、爲人所誤會、殊屬可悲、謂不剿匪則責其縱匪剿匪、則責其軍事活動之擴張、日人又謂滿洲治安維持會願意且力能維持治安但恐張學良復權後予以報復、因該會大都爲反張分子所組織也、故張學良復返瀋陽之可能性存在一日、則可使日本撤兵的狀况之恢復、亦延緩一日也、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）過去二十四小時内有二主要特點、爲陸軍不願見張學良復爲滿洲行政長官、一爲政府對於錦州炸彈案之態度、惟陸軍省雖與外務省意見不盡相同但政府與陸軍似皆願見滿洲中國行政之恢復、　不過欲確知後來行政者須能担保維持治安秩序　及保障日僑之生命財産尤須能依約行事且　外務省固不反對張學　　　　瀋陽　但　　　局則已切實表明不再信任張氏、决不許其恢復滿洲政權、日政府之所以不願干涉者、蓋以國聨不充分明悉滿洲問題之歷史的背景、而不能了解日本要求之公允也、此種要求、張學良前已不能依允、今日本猶堅持之、無論何人來治滿洲、必須承認此要求、而後始可有最後之解决、軍事當局之反對張學良復回瀋陽者、蓋恐張復權後、仍將用其延宕政策也、日本所要求者内有一條、係敷設敦化通至朝鮮邊界之鐵道此路極有戰略上與商業上之價值、陸軍省對此極爲注重、蓋防將來蘇俄侵害也、政府與軍人皆以其滿洲要求爲正當、惟對於厲行要求之方法意見似不盡洽、錦州炸彈案、已銷减日本向南京抗議之影響、日政府似頗懊喪、但在表面上不能承認軍人所發此舉純爲自衞之說、　蓋如此庶不致發生軍人行動與政府公布之政策兩相抵觸之問題也、若干觀察者以爲外相幣原有辭職意、但須待至相當時機、因恐此時引退將爲外國所誤解、而在討論最後解决時妨害日本之利益也、（十日路透社電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）美政府異常法意東省事件、今日閣議例會、已討論及此、目下美京盛傳不日將召集九國公約簽字國會議、或請中日雙方注意凱洛格非戰公約之義務、國務卿史　生於閣議後宣稱、渠將全日考慮東省事件、　今日史氏曾與國務副卿凱塞爾遠東司長　培克及駐日大使福白士商榷此事、昨日則與中國代辦容揆晤談三小時之久、惟閣議内容、與美國此時是否擬續有舉動、則當局俱不欲宣示、據某要人談、美政府對於中日間緊急局勢、甚爲關切、以爲當此世界經濟財政恐慌之際、設中日間一旦發生戰事、將造成無上之悲劇、此間觀察時事者現信欲免中日間戰事、惟有立即召集九國公約簽字國會議、或分牒中日請其注意凱洛格非戰公約、規定用公斷解决國際間爭端之義務、第美國對於東省事件、究欲取何種行動迄今尙無正式切實表示、又據某方面稱、美政府覺中國之抵制日貨、乃一偉大武器、憑藉此經濟上之對日抵制、可迫日本解决中日間糾紛、惟此間現尙未有表示、美國正式贊成用經濟抵制、爲對抗刺刀政策之武器也、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓今日胡佛總統參與内閣會議、討論關於滿洲之遠東重要發展、事後並未發表文告、第悉美政府擬集世界公論、以阻中日間之繼續衝突、國務卿史汀生現注其全副精神於遠東問題、國務院中人料當局不日將有行動目下切實消息、無從可得、但聞當局不致以積極行動對付日本、蓋此種行逕、須以嚴厲之牒文致日政府也、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）中國代辦容揆今日以中政府正式照會送達美國務院、請美國指派外交人員至遼吉省政府、當中國接收日兵撤退各地時充任顧問、至美政府對此態度、現因國務卿史汀生不在京、無從探測、聞日大使出淵於史汀生出京前曾訪史氏、對日飛機之轟擊錦州、有所狡辯、担保此舉並非表示日本對華更抱侵略態度、實係軍事上單獨發生之意外事件、其結果雖屬不幸、但未爲日政府所贊成、并重行聲明日本對華無侵略領士野心、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）路透社今日探悉美政府俟確悉中代表前向國聨所發之担任未經履行時、即將决定對於滿洲時局之行爲、查中日所担任者、爲採行各種必要之舉動、以阻止時局之愈臻嚴重、日本担任繼續儘速將日軍撤回至南滿鐵路區域、而中國担任在日本撤兵時負鐵路區域外日人生命財産安全之責、（十日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c24">已衆與政治 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>「政治」爲團體生活所表現各種。方式中之一種。故政治應爲公衆之意志與活動之匯。合應適合於公衆之利益。反之。則爲「私見。」爲「局部的活動。」爲一種壟斷的不合。理的行爲。不能謂爲政治。</p>
<p>居政者爲民衆之公僕。政權受自民衆故政權基於民權。傳有云。「天生民而立之君。使司牧之。豈其使一人恣於民上。」實則從政者。非民之司牧而爲民意之執行人。一人恣於民上。固所不容。即少數人恣於民上。亦所不容。恣者何。即不顧氏意是。</p>
<p>何曰不顧氏意。尹文子有云。「已是而舉世非之。則不知己之是。己非而舉世是之。亦不知己所非。然則是非隨衆價而爲正。非己所能了。則犯衆者爲非。順衆者爲是。」不以衆價爲是非。即爲不顧民意。不顧民意之政治。即非民衆所共有共享。即將不爲民衆所擁護。民衆不可欺。萬目睽睽。視聽最聰。只知事實决非「空頭支票」所能終始曚混。有民乃有國有政。失其民則將失其一切。此意吾敢以至誠貢獻於今日之從政者諸公。</p>
<p>政黨非能超時間空間而存在。亦必基於民衆。政黨之能獲得廣大羣衆之擁護。在於其主義與政策。能適合民衆之要求。而且能切實執行兌現。民無好惡。代表其利益。實現其要求者即得其擁護。</p>
<p>執行一黨之主義與政。策責在黨員。民衆翹首企盼主義之實現。而黨終無以滿足民衆之要求。是爲黨負民衆。黨員負其黨。若更離德離心。内起爭持。爭持不已。訴諸武力。分崩離忻。民受其殃。國蒙其害。則黨更負民衆。誤國家。黨員更負其黨。</p>
<p>收拾民心之道無他。在於回復到民衆之立場上來。在於切實執行適合民衆利益之主義與政策。黨之出路在此。國家之出路亦在此。此點吾人謹以至誠貢獻今日執政之政黨。</p>
<p>政治爲人民所共有。人民即應切實享此權利。同時更應盡其應盡之義務。義務爲何。即監督政治是。政治之良否。繫於人民自身。不良政治之所以存在。其唯一保障。即依賴於放棄其權利與義務毫不管事之人民。管事不在於消極不負責任之謾駡。而在於積極之推動與監督。有負責任之國民。决無紊亂之政治。决無紊亂之國家。故在政治措施不符於民衆公意之時。負責之民衆即應起而大聲說話。</p>
<p>然而「說話」固非易易須先具有政治意識。具有政治習。慣。具有判斷政治之能力。至少亦須大多數國民具備此二種條件。說話才能有「力。」</p>

<p>（南京）日本對我國排日運動提出之節略、十一晨十時、由日使重光葵面交外次李錦綸、該節略共四點、已由外部發表、其原文如下、</p>
<p>（一）此次滿洲事件、乃中國之多年排日思想、對我軍隊挑撥的態度使然、此乃我軍方面衞之措置、日本政府業已聲明在案、故中國政府對此案當然須負其責任、日本政府關於近來中國各地之組織的排日運動、屢次要求中國政府取締、同時常念兩國之親交、隱忍自制、以期事態之改善、不意該項運動日加激烈、現在上海及其他各地之反日會、不僅禁止日本商品之買賣及運輸、且决定破壞旣存契約、及其他禁止與日本人之各種交易、禁止與日本向來僱傭關係等、所謂對日經濟絶交、並以檢查扣留脅迫暴行等種種手段、强制實行、不肯實行者、不僅科以嚴峻之處分、更甚者、且决議處以槍殺、雖日本人所有之貨物、亦出以掠奪扣留之舉、對於日本之生命財産之暴行侵害行爲、到處續出、至使所有在中國各地方之日本僑民全部或、一部不得、已而退出</p>
<p>（二）中國之排日運、動照中國特殊之政治組織觀之、乃至與政府職權難以區分之黨部直接間接指導之下、實現之手段、不能與無統制之個人自由思想同樣看待、此種行動、不僅與中日間現存條約之規定及精神相背馳、且反於正義友好之觀念、其意義乃不依武力之敵對行爲、甚爲明瞭、中國政府對此、不立即取有效之手段、吾人相信其責任極爲重大、尤其僅僅一私的全體之反日會、對於個人處以刑罰、不能不認爲此乃顯然的合認其自國國家之權力也、</p>
<p>（三）前在國聨行政院、中國代表與日本代表關於防止事態擴大一層、業經與以保障今排日團體對於中國各地日本臣民通商之自由、及生命財産之安全、與以威脅、中央政府亦未有控制之誠意、於事實上未施以有効之取締手段、不得不認爲違反上述之所謂保障、而使事態擴大、</p>
<p>（四）因之日本政府茲更對於上述排日團體之行動、喚起中國政府之深切注意、中國政府若對於排斥日貨運動之取締、曁日本人民生命財産及利益之保護義務、不能完成、則因此之一切責任、應歸國民政府負担、特此聲明、（十一日專電）</p>

<p>親愛的國人。這二十天來。關於抵制日貨的工作。確是做得很熱烈。演購。開會。派檢查。貼標語。轟轟烈烈地普遍於上海一市。於是無論紅男綠女。白叟黄童。也都知道日貨是應當抵制。而人人不願再買日貨了。但是中國地大物博。在都會中做這些宣傳抵貨的工作。還不算數。大家該分些心力。到内地去。到鄉間去。努力地宣傳。因爲内地與鄉間。交通較不便。民智閉塞。恐怕連暴日侵佔東三省的事情。還不甚了了。而仍然賣買日貨。所以非快快的前去宣傳不可。同志們。到内地去。到鄉間去。</p>

<p>清兵入關，明朝老百姓愛頭髮甚於愛國家，等到國家亡了，頭髮也不免要給人剃光。二百八十六年前，多鐸下江南，四月破揚州，五月南京失守，下薙髮令，呌剃頭匠挑着担子在街上走，遇着蓄髮的人，便捉來硬剃，如有不服，便把頭兒割下來掛在担竿上示衆。後來剃頭担上爲什麽有一根竿子?這竿子便是當年預備在那兒掛人頭的。那時的韃子和漢奸在佈告上也有和近代標語相類的文字，最殘忍的有兩句，便是「留頭不留髮，留髮不留頭。一那些愛髮甚於愛國的老百姓於今却又愛髮甚於愛頭，各處起來護髮抗清以萬計。這些老百姓雖是從前有些顚倒輕重，但比着那些見刀即剃毫無抵抗的人是比較的有志氣了。可惜他們平日没有訓練又没有好的武器，所以過不得十天半個月便先後被人消滅了。假使他們早用護髮的力量去護國，又何至累得子孫們去做二百六十八年的亡國奴？我們如果不願再蹈他們的覆轍便須（一）愛國過於愛自己的身家；（二）趕早團結起來，學得眞武藝，一致拼命禦外侮。現在全國一般國民多數已經明白這個大道理，必能齊起心來共救國難。但是醉生夢死的糊塗人還是不少。好，你們要知道亡國是什麽滋味，只須想一想那剃頭担上的竿子。</p>

<p>孫中山先生。於乙未廣州第一次革命失敗後。避地横濱。無何。即有檀香山之行。旋轉美宣傳革命。深受華僑之歡迎。漸爲駐美清使館偵悉。行動多不便。遂决計赴英京倫敦。</p>
<p>抵英倫後。改名陳文。字載之。寓克賴旅社。知其師康德毛生兩醫生。返英已久。約期相見。師生甚樂。康寓距中國使館甚近。每日赴康寓。多經使館前。因於途上與使館譯員鄧廷鏗邂逅。遂與接談。有間。孫出金表以覘時刻。鄧索觀。則刻英文拼音之孫字。鄧恍然。不動聲色。報告龔心湛（龔爲公使龔照瑗之姪）轉陳公使。乃與英顧問馬凱尼密謀。誘孫先生入館之三層樓房。命中西差僕嚴爲防守。預備</p>
<p>廣州。以邀功叙勛。時爲十月十一日也。孫先生被困六日。屢次設法求館中英僕遞函求援於康德毛生兩醫生。均被搜去。守衞益嚴。孫先生束手無策。日以禱告上帝爲自慰之方。（孫曾致書香港區鳳墀長老叙述禱告甚詳。年來基督徒輒以此函證明孫爲熱心敎徒之用）</p>
<p>嗟夫。鏡不磨而不明。鐵不煉而不精。上天無絶人之路。况爲中華民族之救星乎。一日。孫先生與英僕閒談。涉及基督敎。事急計生。詢以土耳其皇殺戮阿美尼亞基督徒事。柯爾點首。孫乃認本人爲基督信徒。爲仇敎之中國滿洲皇帝所嫉害。久欲捕而殺之。如土耳其皇之待阿美尼亞人然。今被囚在使館。日内即解送返國。且施極刑。因英國政府素重人道。保障敎徒。彼等乃秘密行動。若能仗義執言。不特爲上主所默佑。實爲中國之福。英國之榮。言詞懇摯。柯氏心動。遂將密書投諸煤簍中。送與康德毛生兩醫生。</p>
<p>康德等得函大驚。遍謁蘇格蘭塲警長及外交部諸人。并投函地球報發表始末。警署初不信。延私家偵探密查使館舉動。於是英相沙士勃雷侯與中國使館大起交涉。倫敦市民。尤形鼓噪。龔照瑗公使知衆怒難犯。遂於十月廿三日恢復孫先生之自由。計蒙難十有二日。當出使館時。萬頭攢動。爭欲一瞻中國革命黨首領之丰采。各報爭相記載。孫先生脫險後。轉游德法比諸國。攷察政治數月。乃返日本。并著倫敦被難記一書行世。</p>
<p>最可笑者。孫先生之被囚於駐英使館。龔心湛實爲之謀。及民十四孫先生在北平逝世。龔氏時爲内務部長。代表段祺瑞在公園社稷壇大殿。對僵臥之孫先生遺體。行三鞠躬禮。龔氏回首當年。正不知作何感想也。</p>

<p>親愛的母親：</p>
<p>勉强壓抑了我無上的悲哀與至深的熱情，寫給你這封訣别的信。現在甚麽也不能阻撓我投筆從軍的志願，我是甚麽也不願意去想到，我所想到的只是爲國効力，願意死在戰場上，作中國的忠鬼。我不能顧念到你，親愛的母親！</p>
<p>不要傷心，不要畏怯，你應當驕傲，因爲這願爲國殤的是你親愛的兒子，我看過許多别個國家的母親也愛伊們的兒子，但遇着國家有事，伊們便忘了私情而勉勵各人的兒子，去爲祖國宣勞，我希望你，親愛的母親，作中國第一個愛國家甚於愛兒子的母親，老實說，以一個青年人去死在槍林彈雨那種慘酷的戰場上，是可悲痛的；不過，不幸而中國亡了，以無數的年青人去受異國人的欺凌與虐待，那更是千萬倍的悲痛甚於戰死，到那時，你將無法來愛你的兒子，眼看着自己的骨血在别人鐵蹄之下宛轉呻吟。</p>
<p>親愛的母親，勇敢些，措乾了慈愛的眼涙。嚴肅着面容，警勵你的兒子；「上前吧，兒子！我養育你，原是爲國家而養育。國家有難，你不勇敢上前你便是辜負了我，也侮辱了我！</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>親愛的母親，我是怎樣希望現在全中國的母親都這樣對伊們的兒子說：「别了，給我的愛與你，我不願意生還來見你！」</p>

<h3 id="c201">影戲素描盧夢殊 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>''Seed''</p>
<p>Seeed''是從一部小說改編而來的、那本小說到底如何我没有讀過、但據那Pree　Sheet''裏編劇者雷曼女士Miss　Gladys　ehman的報告是劇與原文是頗有一點出入之處、然這齣影戲之值得一觀是無任誰都得認許的、我早在幾個月之前已經看過了、看了甚爲滿意、</p>
<p>劇節並没有離奇曲折、富麗堂皇的地方、但故事的演述的幽妙雋永、俊逸清新、就已夠你做「白晝之夢」、</p>
<p>我很同情我的朋友穆羅茶兄在一「兩年」裏、平凡的事實、用藝術手段現出來」的一句話、''Seed''就是拿平凡的故事用藝術手段表現出來的一件藝術作品、</p>
<p>現没有奇特的情節、也没有偉大的佈景、更没有堂皇的表現、但它打到人們的心坎來的力量就很充足、</p>
<p>幾年前的「日出」''Sun　ise''我們看過之後稱讚得不得了、但是「日出」並不怎樣有奇特的情節、有偉大的佈景、和有堂皇的表現、祗就平凡的故事來演述平凡的生活而已、一對狗男女的肉麻故事有甚麽希奇、可是一用藝術手段表現出來就給你稱讚得了不得了、''Seed就是這樣十年憧憬、背棄妻拏、是平凡的生活中的一節平凡的故事而已、但一用藝術手段表現出來就給你非常滿意了、影戲這一件産品唯眞藝術才能夠給人以奇妙的「幻想」、那些不徹底的　麗堂皇、祇敎人看了如同嚼蠟、</p>
<p>''Seed''便是眞藝術的表現、它的情節很凄麗、很淡雅、也很俊逸、它的故事很微妙、很清新、也很幽婉、　它的全劇給人看了、有些像聽了我們廣東民間的情歌、有些像在都市聽着提琴的獨奏、又有些像在月下聽那江上商婦的琵琶、　然而</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>油熱温馨、凄宛有致、却又令人不能忘情於劇中人也、</p>
<p>我的朋友穆羅茶兄新近做了一篇短篇小說呌做「溝」刋在「前鋒月刋」第五期裏、那篇「溝」是寫男女日常生活的故事的、那「溝」字呌廣東人念起來、在字音上就發生很妙的解釋了、我的朋友在拿這字做題目時、是不是爲着這妙解而寫男女日常生活我不得而知、因爲我們好久没有見面了、但''Seed''裏面却完全是爲着「溝」而巳、其實我們在近文明底下竭力地挣扎也的確是爲着「溝」而已、要是曉得「溝」、這才曉得''Seed''的偉大、</p>
<p>''Seed''的劇旨是女人抵抗女人、爲的是「愛」然而愛、拆穿來說是「溝」的''Mask''而已、如果自命爲在都市藝術文化裏受過洗禮的、都該得承認我這句說話、</p>
<p>在題目上講、焦點完全是集中於「兒女」身上、的確、劇中人已經有了五個子女了、他的妻所以抵抗女人、在表面上、也是爲着道五個子女然而、實在講來却是爲着「溝」啊、</p>
<p>啊、男女日常生活、</p>
<p>唯其是男女日常生活、所以、就在日常之中的悠悠人海裏激動着許許多多瀲灔的波光、吹出來許許多多奇麗的泡影、即如''Seed''便就是這許許多多瀲灔的波光中特别瀲灔的一波、這許許多多奇麗的泡影中特别奇麗的一影了、如果你拿它來象徵景物罷、那彷彿是晚霞殘照之下、碧波如鏡之上的一陣水花說它是幻想呢、便許是你在影戲裏做了一回三角戀愛裏特别温馨的「白晝之夢」了、</p>
<p>''Seed''的原著在美國是一本甚爲風行的小說、銷數在數十萬以上、已經好幾次再版了、作者諾理斯（Caarles　G·Norris）在美國有了現代作家之名就是爲着是本小說風行的緣故、至於影戲、是寰球公司的出品、已經譯成華名呌做「負心郎」了、</p>

<h3 id="e2">Notification Received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council will hold a meeting tomorrow, attended by diplomatic leaders from various countries.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Mr. Le Loux, Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, stating that due to the emergency situation in the eastern provinces, the Chinese delegation had notified all council members in writing on the 9th of this month that the Administrative Council meeting should be reopened earlier. The Administrative Council meeting was originally scheduled to reopen on Tuesday, October 13th, instead of Wednesday, October 4th. In accordance with item 9 of the council's decision on September 30th, please promptly notify the League of Nations Secretary-General of any expansion of the incident, so that it can be communicated to all council members. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also received a telegram from Mr. Drummond, Secretary-General of the League of Nations Administrative Council, stating that he had been instructed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council to inform the Chinese government of the following: according to received information, various incidents have occurred in Manchuria and other places, which are sufficient to cause disputes and make mediation difficult. Before the reopening of the Administrative Council meeting, both parties should abide by the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant, avoid any actions that could escalate the incident, and hopefully take measures suitable for the League of Nations' statements and the resolution of September 30th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The situation in the Chinese Eastern Provinces is becoming increasingly tense, and the League of Nations Council has scheduled a special meeting for Tuesday. It is reported that the diplomatic leaders of Britain, France, Italy, Spain, and other countries will participate, and Spanish Foreign Minister Le Loux will remain as chairman. The League of Nations is in a very difficult position. Chinese representative Shi Zhaoji has been reporting all developments in the eastern provinces to the League of Nations on a daily basis, while Japanese Minister to France Yoshizawa has been submitting separate reports and declarations, each with conflicting accounts. It is difficult for the League of Nations to take sides. This is the most arduous task since the League of Nations was established. If it resolutely judges who is right and who is wrong, the League of Nations itself may be in danger of splitting. Furthermore, the meeting will last for three days, and US Minister to Switzerland Wilson will participate in the discussions in an observer capacity. Some say that the League of Nations is in such a difficult position that it may seek to transfer the responsibility of resolving this matter to the United States, so that it can be judged according to the Washington Nine-Power Treaty or the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (National News Agency dispatch, 10th) (Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat is preparing for the meeting on Tuesday. According to sources in London, British chief delegate Cecil will depart for Geneva on Monday with Foreign Secretary Reading. It is also reported that French Foreign Minister Briand, Spanish Foreign Minister Le Loux (Chairman of the Council), Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, and Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski will all attend. Germany may be represented by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Brüning himself. It is said that after hearing reports from Chinese and Japanese representatives on the latest situation at the meeting on Tuesday, the meeting will be adjourned so that the representatives of various countries can privately contact the Chinese and Japanese representatives separately. If a solution can be negotiated, the Council will conclude its session on Saturday. Currently, people in the League of Nations admit that no country intends to consider economic sanctions against China or Japan, unless this is the final method to prevent future wars. However, they recognize that if this meeting cannot prevent the Sino-Japanese war, then there is no need to convene a disarmament conference in February next year. Therefore, this Sino-Japanese dispute can be regarded as the supreme test of the League of Nations' ability to prevent member states from going to war. If it fails, the League of Nations must admit that countries have no choice but to maintain sufficient military strength for national defense. Otherwise, they can only rely on collective security guarantees organized among countries, as advocated by France. However, the US government cannot accept the French government's rationale this time. (National News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Here, everyone feels that the US government's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute is now strengthening the League of Nations Administrative Council's ability to seek a peaceful resolution. The spirit of the Administrative Council has been greatly boosted this time. There is no doubt that the Administrative Council is facing a thorny problem, but all friends of the League of Nations sincerely hope that it will emerge victorious from its predicament. The fact that British Foreign Secretary Reading, Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, French Foreign Minister Briand, and Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski will all participate has created a very good impression and increased the authority of the Administrative Council. The last Administrative Council unfortunately lacked authority. German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Brüning may not be able to come here because the parliament is about to open. Deputy Foreign Minister Bru might attend. The Administrative Council will first hold a closed meeting on Tuesday, with acting chairman Le Loux and the representatives of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, China, and Japan discussing the Manchurian incident, hoping to gain an understanding, and then hold a public meeting. The Chinese government has telegraphed two notes to the League of Nations, requesting Japan to withdraw its troops. At the request of the Chinese government, the League of Nations has distributed the telegrams to the members of the Administrative Council. The second Chinese note states at the end that a duplicate of this note will be sent to the League of Nations Administrative Council and the US State Department. The daily situation report will also be telegraphed to both Geneva and Washington. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Reuters learned today that whether or not Foreign Minister Briand will attend the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on Tuesday will depend on the development of the situation in the Far East and the procedures of the Administrative Council meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond reported to the Council today that the Chinese note of the 6th, notifying Japan of its readiness to take over the areas where Japanese troops are withdrawing, has not yet been answered by the Japanese government. China has now sent a second note to Japan, delivered by Chinese Minister to Japan Jiang Zuobin, requesting that the Japanese government immediately return the occupied areas and property to China in accordance with the League of Nations Council resolution of September 30th, so that Chinese officials can begin taking over on the 11th. The wording is quite stern, and contains a hint of an ultimatum. Today, Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Shi Zhaoji notified the Council that Japan has organized Mongolian troops, providing them with 3,000 rifles, 1 million rounds of ammunition, 4 mortars, 4 mountain guns, and 2 aircraft. These weapons were all seized from the Chinese Shenyang Arsenal. Japan is now preparing to command the Mongolian troops to attack Zhengjiatun in the near future. Japanese representative Yoshizawa also notified the Council that, in view of the extremely fierce anti-Japanese movement in China, it is clear that China is determined to sever economic relations with Japan. Japanese representative continued to notify the Council that Japan had notified China that all actions of Japanese troops in China were legitimate acts of self-defense, arising from the provocative attitude taken by the Chinese people and officials. Therefore, China should bear full responsibility for the arrival of Japanese armed forces in China. He also stated that China has failed to suppress the anti-Japanese movement and adequately protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, and that the National Government should be responsible for the damage suffered by the lives and property of Japanese residents due to the anti-Japanese movement. (National News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council, having received serious news from here, has decided to discuss the Manchurian incident on Tuesday (one day earlier than expected). (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Mr. Le Loux, acting chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, today telegraphed all members, convening a meeting at noon on Tuesday, at the request of Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji. Le Loux also suggested to all members that if they receive any news regarding the development of the situation in the Far East, they should send it to the League of Nations Secretary-General as soon as possible for submission to the Administrative Council. League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond has telegraphed the governments of China and Japan, as follows: "The Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council instructs me to send the following message to your government: 'The news received here shows that the events occurring in Manchuria and other places only serve to exacerbate emotions and make solutions more difficult. In this situation, and before the Administrative Council meeting opens, I, as Chairman of the Administrative Council, feel obliged to remind both parties of their guarantees made in the Administrative Council not to take any further action that would make the situation more serious. I sincerely hope that both parties will fully fulfill their promises made to the Administrative Council and contained in the Administrative Council's resolution of September 30th.'" The above telegram has been notified to all members of the Administrative Council and the US government. Secretary-General Drummond. (Geneva) US Ambassador Gilbert met with Drummond and other key figures in the League of Nations today, hoping that the United States would cooperate with the League of Nations to take stern action on the eastern provinces incident as soon as possible. Japanese Ambassador to Germany Yoshizawa also met with the French Foreign Minister in Paris for a long time. It is also reported that British Foreign Secretary Reading is expected to go to Geneva to attend the Council meeting. (National News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese government has sent a new petition to the League of Nations, detailing the circumstances of the bombing of Jinzhou by Japanese aircraft on October 8th, requesting the League of Nations to quickly take measures to protect peace. The Chinese government also requested the League of Nations to send a commission to Jinzhou to conduct an on-the-spot investigation, and requested all members of the Administrative Council to inquire about everything from local people.

<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Japanese government has received a telegram from Nanjing, demanding that Japanese troops outside the South Manchurian Railway area be withdrawn within a week. According to the Chinese Minister to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, negotiations with Foreign Minister Shidehara have been going on for several days, with the aim of enabling Zhang Zuoxiang to take over the area and maintain law and order after the Japanese troops withdraw. However, there is still no progress, so Nanjing sent this note urging them to proceed. It is now reported that Japan's reply to the League of Nations will be sent out tonight, but the full text will be released in two or three days. In addition to explaining the necessity of the bombing of Jinzhou, the Japanese government stated that it had no choice but to take this action in order to protect Koreans, and asked the League of Nations not to increase China's hope for League of Nations intervention. The reply stated on the one hand that Japan does not want to demand new rights in Manchuria, and on the other hand explained that the rights Japan has obtained under existing treaties should be respected. The Chinese side stated that if the Japanese troops do not withdraw, China cannot be responsible for maintaining law and order in Manchuria, while the Japanese side stated that if China cannot provide concrete evidence that it can protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, the Japanese troops will never withdraw. The two sides are deadlocked. If the negotiations between Minister Jiang and Shidehara are ineffective, the dispute cannot be resolved in a short time. The Japanese believe that the actions of the Japanese troops in Manchuria have been misunderstood, which is very regrettable. They say that if they do not suppress bandits, they are accused of condoning bandits; if they suppress bandits, they are accused of expanding military activities. The Japanese also said that the Manchurian Law and Order Maintenance Association is willing and able to maintain law and order, but fears retaliation from Zhang Xueliang after he regains power, because the association is mostly organized by anti-Zhang elements. Therefore, as long as the possibility of Zhang Xueliang returning to Shenyang exists, the restoration of the situation that would allow Japan to withdraw its troops will also be delayed. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There are two main characteristics in the past 24 hours: the army does not want to see Zhang Xueliang reinstated as the administrative head of Manchuria, and the government's attitude towards the Jinzhou bombing case. Although the Army Ministry and the Foreign Ministry do not entirely agree, the government and the army seem to want to see the restoration of Chinese administration in Manchuria, but they want to be sure that the later administrator will be able to guarantee the maintenance of law and order and the protection of the lives and property of Japanese residents, and must be able to act in accordance with the treaty. The Foreign Ministry does not oppose Zhang Xue returning to Shenyang, but the local bureau has clearly stated that it no longer trusts Zhang and will never allow him to restore his political power in Manchuria. The reason why the Japanese government is unwilling to intervene is that the League of Nations does not fully understand the historical background of the Manchurian issue and cannot understand the fairness of Japan's demands. Zhang Xueliang was previously unable to agree to these demands, and Japan still insists on them. Whoever comes to govern Manchuria must recognize these demands before a final solution can be reached. The military authorities oppose Zhang Xueliang's return to Shenyang because they fear that Zhang will still use his delaying tactics after he regains power. One of Japan's demands is to build a railway from Dunhua to the Korean border. This road is of great strategic and commercial value, and the Army Ministry attaches great importance to it, in order to prevent future Soviet Russian aggression. The government and the military both believe that their demands on Manchuria are legitimate, but their opinions on how to implement the demands seem to be not entirely in agreement. The Jinzhou bombing case has weakened the impact of Japan's protest to Nanjing. The Japanese government seems quite frustrated, but on the surface it cannot admit that the military's actions were purely in self-defense, so as not to cause the military's actions to conflict with the government's announced policy. Some observers believe that Foreign Minister Shidehara intends to resign, but must wait for a suitable time, because he fears that his retirement at this time will be misunderstood by foreign countries and hinder Japan's interests in the final solution.

<p>Recognizes Embargo as China's Greatest Weapon</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government is extremely concerned about the situation in the eastern provinces. This matter was discussed at today's regular cabinet meeting. It is now widely rumored in Washington that a conference of the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty will be convened soon, or that China and Japan will be asked to pay attention to their obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Secretary of State Stimson declared after the cabinet meeting that he would consider the situation in the eastern provinces all day long. Today, Mr. Stimson consulted with Deputy Secretary of State Castle, Far East Director Baker, and Ambassador to Japan Forbes on this matter. Yesterday, he met with Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Rong Kui for three hours. However, the content of the cabinet meeting and whether the United States intends to take further action at this time are not being disclosed by the authorities. According to a certain important person, the US government is very concerned about the emergency situation between China and Japan, believing that if a war breaks out between China and Japan at a time when the world is facing economic and financial panic, it will create an unparalleled tragedy. Observers here now believe that the only way to avoid war between China and Japan is to immediately convene a conference of the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, or to send notes to China and Japan asking them to pay attention to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which stipulates the obligation to resolve international disputes through arbitration. However, the United States has not yet made a formal and concrete indication of what kind of action it intends to take on the eastern provinces incident. According to some sources, the US government believes that China's boycott of Japanese goods is a great weapon. By relying on this economic boycott of Japan, Japan can be forced to resolve the dispute between China and Japan. However, there is currently no indication here that the United States officially approves of using economic boycotts as a weapon against bayonet policies. (National News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, President Hoover participated in a cabinet meeting to discuss the important developments in the Far East regarding Manchuria. No statement was issued afterwards. However, it is understood that the US government intends to gather world public opinion to prevent the continued conflict between China and Japan. Secretary of State Stimson is now focusing all his attention on the Far East issue. People in the State Department expect the authorities to take action soon. There is currently no concrete news available, but it is said that the authorities will not take active action against Japan, because such action would require sending a harsh note to the Japanese government. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Rong Kui today sent a formal note from the Chinese government to the US State Department, requesting that the United States appoint diplomatic personnel to the Liaoning and Jilin provincial governments to serve as advisors when China takes over the areas where Japanese troops are withdrawing. The US government's attitude towards this is currently impossible to determine because Secretary of State Stimson is out of town. It is reported that Japanese Ambassador Debuchi visited Mr. Stimson before he left town and made excuses for the bombing of Jinzhou by Japanese aircraft, guaranteeing that this action did not indicate that Japan had a more aggressive attitude towards China. It was actually an isolated accidental military incident, the result of which was unfortunate, but not endorsed by the Japanese government. He reiterated that Japan had no intention of aggressing on Chinese territory. (National News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Reuters learned today that the US government will decide on its actions regarding the situation in Manchuria after it is sure that the undertakings made by the Chinese representative to the League of Nations have not been fulfilled.

Japan undertook to continue to withdraw Japanese troops to the South Manchurian Railway area as soon as possible, and China undertook to be responsible for the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the railway area when the Japanese troops withdraw.

<p>Accuses Our Army of Shooting at Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara, in response to British Ambassador Lindley's request for the Japanese government to explain the Jinzhou bombing incident, issued a declaration today, claiming that the Japanese army aircraft bombed Jinzhou because Chinese troops were concentrating there, and Japan had to act quickly for self-defense and maintaining order. He also claimed that if the Chinese soldiers had not fired at the Japanese aircraft, the Japanese aircraft would not have bombed the local temporary provincial government and military camp. He also claimed that the Japanese government approved this action at yesterday's cabinet meeting after receiving a report from the military commander. He also said that dropping bombs in self-defense does not violate international law. (National News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Chairman of the League of Nations Council telegraphed the Chinese and Japanese governments on the 9th to prevent the situation from escalating due to the Jinzhou incident, the Japanese Foreign Ministry worked out a reply yesterday. After Foreign Minister Shidehara obtained the understanding of Prime Minister Wakatsuki and Army Minister Minami, it was sent out today. The gist of the reply is that the Jinzhou incident will not escalate the situation, and the Japanese government is working hard to prevent the escalation of the situation, as can be seen in the handling of the cases of abuse and killing of Koreans in Manchuria and Korea. This time, in view of the fact that the former demobilized troops were gathering east and west of the Manchurian Railway line, posing a threat, and Zhang Xueliang established a provincial government in Jinzhou as a gathering place for the remaining troops, the Japanese army sent aircraft to Jinzhou for reconnaissance in order to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. Because the Chinese army fired at them, they dropped bombs in self-defense. (Dentsu dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In view of the activities of the League of Nations and the US government after the Jinzhou incident, the Japanese government is now preparing a second statement to be telegraphed to Japanese representative Yoshizawa for publication at the reopening of the League of Nations Council. The gist of the statement is to clarify the outline of the Japanese government's demands on China, that is, the basis of Sino-Japanese relations, with the main points being that China fundamentally stops the anti-Japanese movement and anti-Japanese education, and strictly fulfills the vested interests in Manchuria and Mongolia under the treaty. There are no other new demands. The aforementioned demands will be negotiated with the Nanjing National Government in principle, and the specific implementation details will be negotiated locally after a new power with real strength is established in Manchuria. It rejects mediation by a third party and resolutely opposes the League of Nations sending inspectors. (Dentsu dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Temporary Measures for Maintaining the Silver and Money Industries</p>

<h3 id="e24">Popular Will and Politics <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>"Politics" is one of the various forms in which group life manifests itself. Therefore, politics should be a convergence of public will and activity, and should be suited to the interests of the public. Conversely, it is "private opinion," a "localized activity," a monopolistic and unreasonable behavior, and cannot be called politics.</p>
<p>Those who govern are servants of the people. Political power is received from the people, so political power is based on civil rights. There is a saying: "Heaven gives birth to the people and establishes a ruler to shepherd them. How can it be that one person is allowed to act willfully above the people?" In fact, those who engage in politics are not shepherds of the people, but executors of the people's will. It is intolerable for one person to act willfully above the people, and it is also intolerable for a few people to act willfully above the people. What is willfulness? It is disregarding the will of the people.</p>
<p>What does it mean to disregard the will of the people? Yin Wenzi said: "If one is right and the world says he is wrong, then he does not know that he is right. If one is wrong and the world says he is right, then he does not know that he is wrong. Therefore, right and wrong follow the public price to be right. It is not what one can understand. Then, those who offend the public are wrong, and those who follow the public are right." Not taking the public price as right and wrong is disregarding the will of the people. Politics that disregards the will of the people is not shared by the people, and will not be supported by the people. The people cannot be deceived. With all eyes watching, their sight and hearing are most acute. Only facts are known, and "blank checks" can never ultimately deceive. With the people, there is the country and the government. Lose the people, and you will lose everything. I dare to offer this idea with utmost sincerity to the gentlemen who are in politics today.</p>
<p>Political parties cannot exist beyond time and space. They must also be based on the people. A political party's ability to gain the support of the broad masses lies in its doctrines and policies, which can meet the demands of the people and can be effectively implemented and fulfilled. The people have no preferences. Whoever represents their interests and realizes their demands will gain their support.</p>
<p>The responsibility for implementing a party's doctrines and policies lies with the party members. The people look forward to the realization of the doctrines, but the party ultimately fails to satisfy the demands of the people. This is the party failing the people, and the party members failing their party. If they further deviate in morality and lose heart, and internal strife arises and continues, resorting to force, disintegrating and splitting apart, the people will suffer and the country will be harmed. Then the party will fail the people even more, mislead the country, and the party members will fail their party even more.</p>
<p>There is no other way to win back the hearts of the people than to return to the position of the people and to effectively implement doctrines and policies that are suited to the interests of the people. The way out for the party lies here, and the way out for the country also lies here. I offer this point with utmost sincerity to the ruling political party today.</p>
<p>Politics is shared by the people, and the people should truly enjoy this right. At the same time, they should also fulfill their due obligations. What are the obligations? That is, to supervise politics. The quality of politics depends on the people themselves. The only guarantee for the existence of bad politics is reliance on people who abandon their rights and obligations and are completely indifferent. Taking charge does not lie in passive and irresponsible scolding, but in active promotion and supervision. A responsible citizen will never have chaotic politics or a chaotic country. Therefore, when political measures do not conform to the public will of the people, responsible citizens should stand up and speak out loudly.</p>
<p>However, "speaking out" is not easy. One must first have political consciousness, political habits, and the ability to judge politics. At least a majority of citizens must possess these two conditions. Only then can speaking out have "power."</p>

<p>Confirming War-like Actions</p>
<p>The Manchester Guardian in London commented on the Manchurian incident, stating that Japan is an aggressor and that its army, whether acting freely or under instructions, is simply engaging in warlike actions. China has shown great patience and completely trusts the League of Nations. There are various signs that Japan is pointing to the passive attitude of the Chinese as aggressive boycotts, hoping to confuse the hearing of the Administrative Council. This is the common sense of the current dispute. The League of Nations' only opportunity is to avoid the trap of cunning diplomacy and rely on common sense to act. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>The London Daily News editorial this morning stated that the Manchurian haze is becoming increasingly dark and that the League of Nations will encounter unprecedentedly difficult problems. It is commendable that the Chinese government has maintained a patient attitude and has not engaged in open acts of war. However, it should be noted that some people believe that China is angry at the League of Nations for not upholding justice and may ally with Russia. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>The London Observer editorial stated that although the world is troubled by financial and economic problems, the diplomatic event that has been most concerning in recent years is the Manchurian dispute, as it not only tests the effectiveness of the League of Nations, but also has a direct relationship to the future of the World Disarmament Conference. If the League of Nations fails, the Disarmament Conference will be hit before it even opens. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>

The White Russian newspapers in Harbin have therefore changed their tone and are reporting pro-Japanese articles. A Japanese named Ozawa is about to publish a Russian-language news magazine, ignoring our side's ban and advocating that the White Russians take the opportunity to rise up. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Ministry of Foreign Affairs Announces Contents of Japanese Protest <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese memorandum on the anti-Japanese movement in our country was handed over to Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Jinlun by Japanese Ambassador Shigetsu Aoi at 10 AM on the 11th. The memorandum has four points, which have been released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Manchurian incident was caused by China's years of anti-Japanese thought and the provocative attitude towards our army. This is our army's measure to protect itself. The Japanese government has already stated this on record. Therefore, the Chinese government should of course be responsible for this case. The Japanese government has repeatedly asked the Chinese government to ban the recent organized anti-Japanese movements in various parts of China. At the same time, it has always remembered the friendship between the two countries and exercised restraint in order to improve the situation. Unexpectedly, the movement has become increasingly fierce. Now, anti-Japanese associations in Shanghai and other places not only prohibit the sale and transportation of Japanese goods, but also decide to destroy existing contracts and other prohibitions on various transactions with the Japanese, and prohibit the employment relationship with Japan. The so-called economic severance with Japan, and various means such as inspection, detention, coercion, and violence are used to enforce it. Those who refuse to implement it are not only subject to severe penalties, but even sentenced to shooting. Even the goods owned by the Japanese are subjected to looting and detention. Acts of violence and infringement on the lives and property of the Japanese continue to occur everywhere, so that all or part of the Japanese residents in various parts of China have no choice but to withdraw.</p>
<p>(2) From the perspective of China's special political organization, the anti-Japanese movement in China is directly and indirectly guided by the party department, which is difficult to distinguish from the government's functions. The means of realization cannot be regarded as the same as the freedom of thought of individuals without control. This kind of action not only runs counter to the provisions and spirit of the existing treaties between China and Japan, but also runs counter to the concept of justice and friendship. Its meaning is clearly an act of hostility that does not rely on force. If the Chinese government does not immediately take effective measures, we believe that its responsibility is extremely important. In particular, a private anti-Japanese association imposes criminal penalties on individuals, which cannot but be regarded as a clear recognition of its own national power.</p>
<p>(3) Previously, in the Executive Council of the League of Nations, the Chinese representative and the Japanese representative guaranteed to prevent the expansion of the situation. Now, the anti-Japanese groups threaten the freedom of commerce of Japanese subjects in various parts of China and the safety of life and property. The central government also has no sincerity in controlling it and has not taken effective measures to ban it in fact. It has to be considered a violation of the above-mentioned guarantee and an expansion of the situation.</p>
<p>(4) Therefore, the Japanese government hereby again draws the Chinese government's attention to the actions of the above-mentioned anti-Japanese groups. If the Chinese government cannot fulfill its obligations to ban the movement to reject Japanese goods and protect the lives, property, and interests of the Japanese people, then the National Government shall bear all the responsibilities for this. This is hereby stated. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Qiqihar) Korean bandits in Shenyang, under the protection of the Japanese army, have been robbing various important figures and institutions for days. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qiqihar) Yuan Jinkai plans to leave the Shenyang Public Security Association and go to Jinzhou to take up the position of political committee member. Commander Honjo of the Japanese army did not allow him to leave. On the 9th, he sent two soldiers to monitor Yuan's actions. Kan Xi has ambitions. The Shenyang Rural Autonomy Bureau, which he established, began operations on the 10th. The director is Wang Lengfo, the editor of the literary and art section of the Shengjing Times, which is run by the Japanese. Wang is from Beiping and has been working in the Shengjing newspaper for many years. He is the only Chinese traitor in Liaoning for the Japanese. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qiqihar) It is rumored in Shenyang that the central government will declare war on Japan. Many merchants and civilians are moving to the countryside to avoid the war. The Japanese military police are prohibiting it. Those who do not listen are often shot, but merchants and civilians are still secretly moving at night. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Harbin) The Shenyang Chamber of Commerce in Harbin negotiated with the maintenance association and issued 200 guns. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People who came to Beiping from Shenyang talked about the situation after the Shenyang incident, where the poor and the rich fell into a hopeless situation. The middle and lower-level officials of the various agencies were the worst. After the 7th Brigade Commander Wang Yizhe was ordered to withdraw from Shenyang, his wife was alone and helpless and begged along the street. The brigade commander's wife is like this, and the others can be imagined. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The telephone and telegraph lines in Liaoning have been converted to Japanese military telephone lines. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A foreign military officer returned to Beiping after investigating in Shenyang. According to talks, Shenyang has not escaped the terror. The shops are open and then closed again. Koreans still take the opportunity to plunder from time to time. On the one hand, the Japanese are forcing the gentry in Shenyang to form a public security maintenance association to be their tools. On the other hand, they are encouraging the Qing dynasty remnants and frustrated politicians to engage in an independence movement so that Manchuria can be placed under their protection as a continuation of Korea.

Mr. Hall, a Briton from the railway bureau, demanded an increase because 10 were too few, but there was no result. There is still no result on the notification of the Huangutun and Liaoning stations.

<p>(Beiping) A foreign military officer talked about the Japanese representative's claim at the League of Nations that the Japanese army's actions in the Eastern Provinces were not military actions, which is too far from the truth based on my investigation. (1) All Chinese aircraft were confiscated by the Japanese army and changed to Japanese markings. (2) The Shenyang mortar factory was converted into a motorcycle towing factory, and all the towing machines in the factory were seized by the Japanese army. (3) The Japanese army in the Shenyang arsenal deliberately withdrew for several hours on the 2nd to allow hooligans to enter and dismantle all the machinery in the factory. Afterwards, the Japanese army re-entered the factory to cover up the act of dismantling the Chinese arsenal. (4) The residences of various important figures were looted by the Japanese army. Such actions are not so brutal even when the victorious country occupies the territory of the defeated country in formal combat. Japan's counter-propaganda is not a military action. It is really a strong word and thick face. (11th Dispatch)</p>

The Japanese army originally planned to ship eight Canet guns, sixteen Western-style guns, four Type 38 guns, four Type 6 Taisho mountain guns, two mortars, and twelve howitzers to Tokyo, but the plan was not approved due to British and American interference. They were still sent back to the arsenal. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Guangzhou students paraded with lanterns to resist Japan on the evening of the 10th. At 6:30 PM, a wounded soldier went to the New World Foreign Goods Store on Yonghan Road to buy things. The store responded to the wounded soldier with Japanese goods, angering him, and he demolished various items. The police arrived and arrested the wounded soldier and took him back to the Yonghan Branch Bureau. Passersby mistakenly thought that students had been arrested and reported to the Anti-Japanese Association of Zhongda University. The association immediately sent students to the branch bureau to negotiate for their release. Director Du Xuantai gave no definite answer, and the crowd gathered more and more, surrounding the bureau. Du and Wu Xueyang, the inspector of the Public Security Bureau, ordered the police to fire on the crowd, causing great chaos. At the same time, more than 10,000 people gathered at the New World Foreign Goods Store and burned Japanese goods. Du and Wu led the police to the scene and fired a second time, arresting more than 100 people. The crowd was furious and repeatedly surrounded the branch bureau.

A total of five or six students, three soldiers, and four or five civilians were killed, and seventy to eighty people were injured, with more than ten seriously injured. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 11th, thousands of people carried seven or eight bloody clothes to the Guangdong Provincial Government to petition for: 1. The dismissal and investigation of Chen Qingyun, 2. The execution of Du Xuantai by firing squad, 3. The execution of all the police who opened fire, 4. Compensation for the compatriots who died, and 5. No more shooting to stop national movements. The Guangdong Provincial Government immediately held an emergency meeting. Chen Qingyun attended the meeting and reported that he had issued orders to stop the shooting three times without effect and would resign to take responsibility. The meeting then resolved three key points to respond to the crowd: 1. Chen has resigned to take responsibility, 2. Du and the police who opened fire will be detained, and a special court will be organized on a fixed date for public trial. One person each will be sent by the provincial and municipal governments, two people from the High Court, and one person from the Army Law Office of an army corps to form a joint group, 3. The Office of the Military Counselor will separately provide compensation and treatment for the injured and killed crowds. The crowd was satisfied and dispersed. All the foreign goods stores on Yonghan Road were closed on the 11th. The Yonghan Branch Bureau is still guarded by security teams. The more than 100 people who were arrested have been released. It is rumored that the New World was set up by Du. (November 11th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Today is National Day. The Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department held separate ceremonies at the Juren Hall. Chairman Zhou Dawen gave a speech, roughly saying that this year's National Day is different from previous years. China has declined to the extreme and is a year of dying. The people of Shenyang are suffering miserably, and they have all fled there alone. We should understand the importance of our responsibilities. If the country does not exist, where will the individual be? The survival of China in the future depends on whether we work hard today. Chairman Dong Lin of the Municipal Party Department said in his speech that today is a day of national disaster and the most tragic day. Not only have the three northeastern provinces been annexed by the Japanese army, but Japanese warships have also gone to the Yangtze River to demonstrate. We should endure hardship and prepare for the final preparations: (1) Economic severance, (2) Organize a volunteer army, hoping to defeat Japan and recover lost territory.

<p>The Nanjing Central Party Headquarters held a memorial meeting on the morning of the 11th at 9:00 AM to commemorate the Premier's ordeal in London. Chiang Kai-shek, Ding Weifen, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Bulei, Zhou Qigang, Wang Boqun, Miao Peicheng, Chen Lifu, Chen Zhaoying, Zhang Daofan, and approximately 600 other staff and guests attended. Chairman Ding Weifen and Shao Yuanchong reported, roughly saying that the Premier escaped to Japan and the United States, and then to the British capital, because the first uprising in Guangzhou had failed. The Manchu government tricked the Premier into the Chinese embassy in London. The Premier remained unyielding and was later released with the help of British friends. In the Premier's life, this was just one of many difficulties and failures. Whenever the Premier encountered difficulties, he always held on to a consistent spirit. The more difficult it was, the more his courage increased. In the current national crisis, this can be an encouragement to our spirit. If a nation is aware of the oppression of the environment, it must be determined to break the difficulties of the environment before it can save itself. When the Premier was in Guangzhou, he was oppressed by more than 30 foreign ships, but he never changed his position on recovering the customs. The Premier, as a single person, living in a corner, was not subdued by external forces. Now we bear the responsibility of the entire country. If we can maintain the principle of national self-determination, any difficulties cannot be avoided. This national crisis is to test whether we have the ability and qualifications for independence. The right to national survival must be controlled by ourselves, not by others. The Premier relied entirely on his own strength for his revolutionary life. Building a revolutionary cause never vainly hoped for success or sought unexpected things. The current crisis is to test whether we are qualified to survive. If we have the power to save ourselves, we can talk about national self-determination. Otherwise, if any foreigners come to oppress us, we will inevitably be naturally eliminated. Today's commemoration allows us to recognize the Premier's responsibility to revive the nation. Now, because of this national crisis, we should use the great teachings to cultivate our personality as a standard for our work. Only in this way can any difficulties prevent us from surviving. After Shao's report, the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned. (November 11th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>The New German Cabinet Established Amidst Storms</p>
<p>Prime Minister Brüning Also Serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Future Fate Depends on the Nationalist Party</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th, National Society Telegraph - Brüning's second cabinet was announced tonight amidst storms. However, judging from the current situation, its fate is precarious. Even Brüning himself knows that he will not last long in office. Therefore, the ministers of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior have not yet been formally appointed. Foreign affairs are the most important task at present, and at this time of national difficulty, internal affairs are even more indispensable. It is now planned that the former Minister of Defense, Groener, will take charge of internal affairs, while Brüning will temporarily take charge of foreign affairs. In Brüning's second cabinet, the only one who can be called a new member is the Minister of Economy, Warmbold. Warmbold was previously the director of the dye trust's agricultural department and is truly an economic expert rather than a politician. The Minister of Transportation, Treviranus, is also a member of Brüning's cabinet. Gürtner has been appointed Minister of Justice and is a permanent secretary in the cabinet's Justice Department, also a non-partisan figure. The others, such as the Minister of Finance, Dietrich, and the Minister of Posts, Schäffer, all remain in their old positions. Brüning is now showing signs of exhaustion, having been running around for 48 hours nonstop. However, the fate of Brüning's cabinet depends on the hands of the Nationalist Party. If the Nationalist Party insists on joining the opposition, then the fate of the new cabinet will be short-lived. A vote of no confidence will be put forward in parliament next week. Although the Social Democratic Party tends not to vote, it is difficult to avert the crisis. Currently, the German National People's Party is also convening an important military conference in Harzburg, and representatives of the Nationalist Party are also participating in the discussion. The steps the Nationalist Party will take in the future will not be announced until Sunday.</p>

<p>Bombs and Machine Guns Fired for Half an Hour</p>
<p>Extremely Heavy Public and Private Losses Inside and Outside the City</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Since Shenyang was captured, the Liaoning Provincial Government was long ago occupied by the Japanese army, and all political power cannot be exercised. The entire Liaoning Province has fallen into a state of anarchy. Zhang Xueliang, because Liaoning Chairman Zang Shiyi is still imprisoned by the Japanese army and has lost his freedom, temporarily appointed Mi Chunlin, director of the Northeast Arsenal, as acting chairman to go to Jinzhou to organize a temporary provincial government. The organization was completed on the 28th of last month, and they worked in the Northeast Jiaotong University school building. At the same time, he issued an order to all counties that all official documents should be sent to the Jin County government for handling. All subordinate departments were also set up in one place. Most of the staff of the provincial government's departments live in the Jiaotong University. Recently, the Japanese have been working hard to promote the independence of Liaoning and Jilin and at the same time want to seize all the political power of the two provinces. They are taking a hostile attitude towards the temporary Liaoning provincial government formed by our side. The day before yesterday (the 7th) in the afternoon, a plane came to Jinzhou and circled in the air for a long time before leaving. Ordinary people already knew that it had malicious intentions and were very worried. Although the Northeast 12th Brigade of Zhang Tingchu was stationed inside and outside the city, because they received orders from their superiors to only sacrifice and not resist, they did not make any preparations. At 1:20 pm yesterday, a large squadron of Japanese planes (reportedly 12 in total) suddenly flew from Yingkou. When passing the Dawa station on the Gouying branch line of the Beining Railway, they dropped a bomb, but fortunately it landed in an open space and there was no loss. At about 2:15 pm, they arrived in Jinzhou and dispersed in the sky above Jinzhou, randomly dropping bombs inside and outside the city and descending to the very bottom, using machine guns to strafe the people who had no resistance or self-defense preparations. Zhang Tingchu's brigade did not fire a single bullet at the Japanese planes because of the principle of non-resistance. The work of the Japanese planes bombing and machine-gunning lasted for more than half an hour. They did not leave until 3:00 pm, feeling satisfied, flying in the original direction. The number of bombs dropped has not been investigated in detail, but it is known that more than 38 have exploded. The damage near the station is extremely heavy, because the target of the Japanese planes was the Liaoning Provincial Government Office in the Northeast Jiaotong University next to the station. Therefore, five or six bombs fell in the station and car barn. A locomotive was destroyed, one passenger car No. 141, and one official car No. 117. Several car barns were also destroyed. More than ten railway workers were injured and six or seven died. The exact number of deaths and injuries in the provincial government has not yet been ascertained, but it is said that a Russian teacher at Jiaotong University was injured by the bombing. The electric wires in front of the railway hospital were all blown off. The residents inside and outside the city showed extreme chaos, carrying things and fleeing. The detailed number of deaths and injuries has not yet been ascertained. It is said that the dead reached 20 or 30, and the injured were 40 or 50. Many houses were also destroyed. The Tiancheng Inn and a certain fruit shop near the station were destroyed by the bombing. Zhang Zuoxiang's private residence - since Zhang came to Jinzhou to attend to his father's illness, he ordered the Beining Road to build a branch line directly to his gate so that his private car could park there. The car was specially prepared by the Jihai Road and was extremely luxurious. Because Jinzhou's business was not developed, it often went to Shanhaiguan to shop. This time, Zhang took the car to Beiping and was not destroyed. However, there were tracks in front of Zhang's residence, which were easily targeted by planes, so a bomb also fell in the residence. The provincial commissioners of the provinces are not always working in the provincial government, so there are no reports of casualties. At the same time, seven Japanese planes were found circling for a long time at the Goubangzi station before leaving. The people of Jinzhou are extremely terrified. Railway workers are in constant danger and have telegraphed the General Administration for instructions. It is also heard that this morning, the Japanese army opened a train of armored cars to Tongliao County, destroying a section of the tracks in the middle of the south station of the county and demolishing the freight yard. Mines were buried nearby, and a Japanese plane scattered leaflets in the air. (October 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Shenyang Under the Iron Heel of the Japanese Army <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Association Receives Beiping Press</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: The Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held a reception for news reporters from Beiping City at the Fengtian Guild Hall at 2 pm yesterday to report on the organization's process and the Japanese atrocities in Shenyang. Chairman Wang Huaichi delivered an opening speech, reporting on the association's purpose and internal organization. Next, Gao Heiquan, inspector of the Liaoning Education Department, reported on the recent situation in Shenyang, saying that he arrived in Beiping from Shenyang on the 4th. Because he went to the city every day to investigate, he knew more details. Here is a description: (1) Military circles: The arsenal and ordnance factory were occupied by the Japanese army, which is well known. I personally saw 30 or 40 Japanese army trucks going back and forth to transport military supplies to the Japanese station from the upstairs in my residence. There were also trucks transporting miscellaneous items every night, which I thought were items seized. However, they were not transported during the day. The Japanese are very hostile to the military. When I came to Beiping, there were very few plainclothes soldiers on the streets. Because the city police were captured by the Japanese army, there were no traces for two days. After negotiations by the maintenance association, 60 unarmed police officers were stationed. On the 28th, after several negotiations, each district began to distribute three guns, but without bullets. As a result of another negotiation on the 1st, 15 bullets were issued for each gun. (2) Government circles: When I entered the city on the 2nd, I personally saw the Japanese army smashing the door plaques of various agencies. The agencies were all occupied. In the first few days, some people still went to work inside, but the situation became more and more panic-stricken. Now there are not many. However, it is heard that the municipal office, the negotiation office, and the official silver house still have people working. The Education Department was closed on the 1st, and Director Jin (Yufub) was arrested and imprisoned in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters with Chairman Zang. It is rumored that the Japanese ordered him to sign a contract for Sino-Japanese joint church management. If he agrees, he will be released, but there has been no news yet. The principal of the 10th Elementary School was also arrested because the contractor used Japanese kiln bricks when building the building and did not pay the price. He was released after paying 1,600 yuan in foreign currency and making a false receipt. He has now escaped. In addition, the principal of the 2nd Industrial Materials School was also reportedly arrested. (3) Business circles: Three or four days after Shenyang was occupied, there was a rice robbery due to the inconvenience of shopping. I personally saw it once in Xiaonanguan. Later, other goods were also robbed from time to time. After the maintenance association was organized, it was unable to stop it. So far, small shops are only open for business for two hours a day, and large stores dare not do business. (4) Industrial circles: Except for the British and American Tobacco Company and foreign factories, which are still working as usual, Chinese small factories have all stopped working. The spinning mill and arsenal were occupied. The arsenal workers initially went to the station and granary to receive food and could still get one dou of rice, but it gradually decreased, from five sheng to one sheng. I don't know what the situation is now. (5) Transportation: The Shenhai Road is still not open. The South Manchuria Railway is extremely crowded, with many refugees. The Beining Road also operates irregularly. There is no room for passengers on the train. The four streetcars in the city have been opened, and public buses have been extended to Dadongmen, as if it were Japanese territory. (6) News media: The Fengtian Public Newspaper is also published, but it states that it only publishes Japanese news. In addition, there is a Fengtian Public Newspaper, which is obviously run by the Japanese. The New Asia Daily seems to have also surrendered. Newspapers from other ports are smuggled in secretly. The Dagong Newspaper was originally allowed to be sold by the municipal office, but the branch manager was arrested by the Japanese military police for selling it, and the newspaper was completely burned. (7) Finance: Fengpiao is still in circulation. Initially, 80 yuan was equivalent to one yuan in silver, but it later rose slightly to 75 yuan per silver yuan. Jinpiao was initially 2.8 yuan, but later it was also 2.45 yuan. The Sino-Japanese and Communications Banks have opened, and there is also a saying that the official silver house is forced to open. Its business methods are only accepting and not paying. Recently, the Japanese army checked the accounts once and did not allow the payment of deposits from various agencies. Individuals who have not had their deposits confiscated are also not allowed to withdraw them. (8) Order: Because there are not many people in the city, it cannot be said to be chaotic. It can only be said to be "serious panic." Initially, the Japanese artillery drove through the streets to show force, but it gradually decreased. However, the sound of gunfire on the streets every night increased day by day. The panic among the citizens is even worse. There are now two Chinese agencies, the Security Maintenance Association, the Citizens Maintenance Association, and the Self-Defense Police Bureau, but they are of no practical benefit. The police bureau seems to be effective during the day, but it is helpless at night. Recently, there is a pessimistic saying about the local maintenance association. (9) Charity: The Red Swastika Society has now set up five porridge shops to provide relief to refugees. The Japanese army also used trucks to spread dry biscuits stored in the granary on the ground along the streets. People scrambled to eat, but this cannot really be called relief. In addition, there is also the Red Cross that sets out daily to provide relief. (10) Robberies: The merchants and people of Shenyang have recently formed a merchant group, with more than ten people in each group, walking along the street with wooden sticks, but it is actually of no use. Robberies occur frequently, with Beiguan being the worst, Nanguan second, and Xiguan the least. The victims are mostly middle and lower-class families. After the people are caught, they are burned under the neck with paraffin wax to force them to ask for money. Koreans are involved in all major robberies. Even if Japanese soldiers arrive, they will not intervene. The spinning mill was occupied by Koreans, and the 3rd Middle School was robbed. Northeast University also suffered losses, so the people fear the Koreans more than the Japanese. (11) The Japanese army was previously dispersed in various places, but has recently been concentrated in one place. Therefore, from the surface observation, there are not many, but in fact they have not withdrawn. The most troops are stationed outside Ximen. The Japanese station changes defenses every day. There is a branch office of the Japanese Military Police in Huanggu屯, and there are also many Japanese soldiers in Juliu River. (12) The people: The people of Liaoning have been oppressed by the Japanese for a long time and have suffered this unexpected disaster. Therefore, they are working hard in secret, but there is no performance on the surface. Next, Zheng Xiangmao, the head of the Liaoning Branch Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society, reported on the statistics of deaths and injuries, saying that the losses on the property after the fall of Liaoning have not yet been investigated and counted in detail. The death of his life, according to my own investigation, is considered to be more accurate than any newspaper. Han Yunpeng was killed on the morning of the 19th, and our association provided relief. He died due to serious injuries. At that time, the Japanese army offered rewards for buying the bodies of senior military officers, and there was a robbery of corpses. Later, the family paid a corpse fee of 400 yuan to protect it. According to the investigation and statistics, there were 87 seriously injured people in Beidaying. The Japanese army did not allow rescue and eventually died tragically. It was a tragedy that the world has not seen. In addition, 39 policemen died and 60 were injured, 144 soldiers died and 127 were injured, 167 civilians died and 270 were injured, and 220 workers died and 110 were injured. These were all investigated by our association, and the rest are unknown. After the report, the meeting adjourned. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">One Glimpse of the Japanese Army's Barbarity in Changchun <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Changchun Communication: After the Japanese army occupied Changchun, its atrocities have been increasing. Now, the recent actions of the Japanese army will be described separately below to inform the people of the country.</p>
<p>Cutting Down Trees and Burying Electric Poles: The Japanese army buried electric poles and installed electric wires in Changchun City. The work was once suspended on the 25th of last month. Unexpectedly, it started again on the 2nd of this month, burying poles and hanging wires along the road, directly to the Nanling camp. It is said that the Japanese side regards Nanling as a fortress and plans to transfer heavy troops to garrison it, using the remaining barracks of our army and adding some barracks, so the buried electric wires are specially for military use. Dajing Road has been buried to the west of the county government's Fourth Road Street Road South, and Dama Road has been buried to the commercial area outside the North Gate. The construction of the third, fourth, and fifth roads has been mostly completed. It has been found that Nanling is about 15 miles from the city. The Japanese commander Duomen has now limited the telecommunications bureau to complete the communication by the 15th of this month. At present, the road protection trees on both sides of the roads in our city have been cut down. On the 28th of last month, Duomen issued a so-called edict, which stated that "the Northeast regime has been overthrown, and you have also lost your support. It is better to obey the power of the Japanese Empire. The troops under the command of Li Zhenshou and other troops should come to surrender their weapons. If you do not come to surrender quickly, our army will carry out a sweeping campaign." The absurdity and barbarity are outrageous.</p>
<p>To Restore Telecommunications, You Must Speak Japanese: The wired and wireless telegraphs in Changchun, as well as the Changchun-Liao-Ha-Hei long-distance telephone, and all communication agencies have been blocked by the Japanese army, who have sent personnel to monitor and guard them, and are not allowed to send reports or communicate, so that internal and external news is cut off and communication is cut off. On the 1st of this month, it was allowed to restore a part of Jilin-Changchun, but although it was allowed to send reports and communicate, it must be checked by the Japanese before it is allowed to be sent and received. All military and political intelligence and news telegrams are still prohibited, and the telegrams are prohibited from using passwords, and the communication must be spoken in Japanese. What is the difference between this kind of restriction and not opening it at all? Now, the regulations of the Japanese army on the revival of communications in Changchun and Jilin are recorded below, and their restrictions and bans can be generally seen: (A) First General Rules: (1) These regulations relate to the regulations on the revival of Chinese communications that have been suspended due to incidents. (2) From now on, communications in Changchun City and Jilin City, as well as communications from Changchun and Jilin to various places, shall be carried out in accordance with these regulations. Military return lines shall not be used for general communications. National wireless telegraphy is temporarily prohibited as it is. (B) Second Implementation Method: One is wired communication. (5) When sending and receiving wired telegraphs, it must be inspected by the Japanese Garrison Commander or other designated person. (6) The Japanese Garrison Commander will send the Chinese Telegraph Bureau for inspection. In Changchun, it will temporarily receive assistance from the telecommunications bureau staff managed by the Kanto Hall. (7) Telegraphs must not be used with passwords. Two are telephones. (8) When communicating by telephone, it shall be carried out in accordance with the following methods: 1. From Changchun and Jilin to various cities, those who want to communicate must temporarily go to the telephone bureau and are only allowed to communicate in Japanese. However, the county public security bureau telephone is allowed to use Chinese, but surveillance officers will be sent to the bureau to monitor. 2. Regarding mutual communication in the city, it shall be allowed according to the progress of communication restoration. (C) (Supplementary Provisions: These regulations shall be implemented from October 1. The above eight restrictive examples are enough to control the mouths of the Chinese people. Whether to restore or not is not important. It is simply that the Chinese have no right to send reports.</p>
<p>Planes Throw Bombs and Kill Farmers: After Changchun fell, five or six Japanese planes flew in the sky to show force every day, no less than ten times. They had not yet thrown bombs to hurt people. Unexpectedly, at 10:25 am on the 2nd of this month, a Japanese plane took off from the Erdao Airport and flew to Nanling. After flying to Nanling at about 11 o'clock, it circled in the air. At that time, there were 50 or 60 poor people, men and women, in the Yuanjia Wobao, East and West Gaotaizi, and Zhujia Datun areas southwest of the city, collecting radishes and cabbage in the Nanling Daying Garden. The plane saw it, lowered its altitude, and flew around the farmers in each village for several circles, attracting people to gather and watch. It actually threw a bomb at the crowd, and with a loud bang, more than 20 people were killed and 15 or 16 injured. After throwing the bomb, the plane flew to the sky in the city. When the bomb exploded, the citizens all suspected that it was a landmine buried by the Japanese army in Nanling, and did not know that it was a plane throwing a bomb. It was not until 8:00 am on the 3rd that the Red Swastika Society reported it and sent personnel to rescue the injured and bury the bodies before they knew the truth. Forty or fifty more of our innocent Chinese people were killed or injured by Japanese planes. The brutality of the Japanese army is increasing and it is also very tragic.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Goes to the Countryside to Search for and Confiscate Civilian Guns: Duomen, commander of the 2nd Division of the Japanese Army, sent more than 60 infantry soldiers from the 29th Regiment from the Toudaogou Japanese boundary to the towns of Xiaohelong and Wanbaoshan in the 235 districts of the county north of our city, as well as the villages of Sandaogou, Sijianfang, and Liao Jia Youfang, starting at 10:00 am on the 2nd of this month, with two handheld machine guns and one mountain gun. At 8:25 am on the 3rd, Changgu, the commander of the 3rd Brigade, sent five or sixty soldiers from the 4th Regiment from Toudaogou to the areas of Dafangshen, Zhujia Wobao, Qiaojia Wobao, and Fanjiadian in the 9th district of our county, with two mountain guns and two machine guns. At 10:00 am on the 4th, a part of the soldiers from the 2nd and 3rd squadrons, 40 or 50 people, set off from the Japanese boundary to the 6th, 7th, and 8th districts of the county, Sijianfang, Hadawobao, Dahelong, Yujiadian, Wanjiaqiao, and Shaoguodian, with two machine guns and steel guns. What is the intention? At first, few knew. It was not until the afternoon of the 4th that villagers came to the city to report that the Japanese army had been coming to the villages in each district every day since the 2nd of this month, searching for civilian self-defense guns and bullets from house to house, intimidating and coercing them, and being extremely violent. If they were not satisfied, they would beat and scold them. In three days, 150 or 60 civilian guns and 20,000 bullets were confiscated in the villages in the northern part of the city. Wherever the Japanese army passed, the civilian guns were confiscated. Generally, the villagers fled and avoided each other. At present, the bad news of the Japanese army going to the countryside to search for guns has spread throughout the county. Most of those with guns have taken them far away. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Japanese Conspiracy to Disrupt the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Supplying White Russian Bandits with Guns and Bullets</p>
<p>Ordering Them to Invade the Dongtie-Haman Line</p>
<p>Su Bingwen Has Sent Troops to Defend</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: White Russian bandits have recently been discovered in the Xiaolingzi and Beidaheshan areas near Hulunbuir on the Dongtie-Haman Line. The leader is a White Russian brigade commander under Zhang Zongchang. His base is in Woniugou, near the Zamiencaimu Company, where he has built a solid fortress with more than 100 horses. The guns and bullets are all new and sufficient, with two machine guns and one small gun. A few days ago, they robbed various small stations near Miand渡河 and planned to destroy the railway line. The background is the Japanese-funded Zamien Caimu Company, which secretly supplies guns, bullets, and food, intending to obstruct the traffic of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union will inevitably send troops to protect the road, and Japan can also send troops to North Manchuria at that time to divide the color with the Soviet Union. Su Bingwen, the commander of the Hulunbuir Garrison, has learned of the plan. On the 1st of this month, he specially sent his aide-de-camp Yan Yongsheng and Chang Tuanfu, an infantry company and a cavalry company from the 6th Infantry Regiment, carrying two mortars and two machine guns, to the mountains to search and suppress the bandits. It is heard that they encountered the bandits at the Naobao Xiaozhan on the morning of the 2nd. After a joint suppression by the cavalry and infantry, more than ten bandits were killed. They are still chasing the bandits. Su is afraid that the bandits will escape into the Zamien Caimu Company and rely on the Japanese as a talisman. He specially telegraphed the provincial capital to ask for a notification to the Japanese consul. On the one hand, he also formed a road patrol team with 300 soldiers, carrying machine guns and mortars, and patrolling back and forth between Hailar and Manzhouli in a train. He also telegraphed Zhang Dianjiu, brigade commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade in Zhalantun, Regiment Commander Zhang of the 2nd Infantry Brigade in Miand渡河, and Regiment Commander Sun of Andada Station, ordering them to send troops to assist in the suppression. The original telegram is as follows: (Telegram 1) The Russian bandits lurking in the Xiaolingzi area are being supplied by the Japanese in the Zamiencaimu Company, which is not only disrupting the local area by destroying the road line, but also the autumn of Liaoji's troubles. The situation in North Manchuria is of great importance. Together with another telegram, it is hoped that the subordinates will be seriously vigilant and send a team to suppress it thoroughly, so as to eliminate the roots. (Telegram 2) According to the report of Regiment Commander Zhang of Miand渡河, dozens of White Russian bandits were found 100 miles north of Xiaolingzi, and it was also heard that the Zamiencaimu Company was supplying the White Russians, trying to disrupt the situation. The regiment was immediately ordered to be responsible for the suppression and dispatched Commander Bao's detachment to assist in the suppression, so as to eliminate the roots. On the one hand, the military department was requested to notify the Japanese Consul Shimizu to avoid misunderstandings when Commander Bao's team went to the forest farm. (October 3)</p>
<h3 id="e85">National Day in the Capital <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th) was the 20th National Day of the Republic of China, and the National Government specially held a military parade to show its grandness. The location was the Ming Palace Airfield. Yu Youren, Kong Xiangxi, Shao Lizi, Shao Yuanchong, Fang Juehui, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Bulei, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, and others were present. Foreign guests included the ambassadors of Germany, Portugal, Spain, and Czechoslovakia, representatives of England, the United States, France, and Italy, and Japanese Consul-General Kamiya. Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by his wife Soong Mei-ling, arrived at the airfield at 9:50 a.m. The military band played loudly, and they ascended the reviewing stand. After the meeting began as scheduled, Commander Gu Zhutong reported on horseback the number of people inspected. Wang Shihe, holding the Commander-in-Chief's flag, led the way. Chairman Chiang, along with Zhu Peide, Chen Yi, He Yaozu, Zhou Yawei, Yang Jie, Wu Siyu, and others, held the military parade. Wherever Chairman Chiang passed, the soldiers saluted. After the review, they ascended the stand for the march-past. Each unit was led by a band, and the soldiers paid attention to the presidential stand. The marching was orderly and the spirit was invigorated. The troops reviewed included the 1st Division Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Division Infantry Regiment, a cavalry squadron, an artillery regiment, five tank platoons, and an engineer communications battalion from the Guards, totaling more than 10,000 people. Each regiment had a band platoon attached, a communications platoon, four automatic machine guns, and four mortars. At 10:00 a.m., the Aviation Administration sent six aircraft to soar through the sky, perform stunts, and parachute. After the review, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech, then called out slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>Memorial Meeting of the Central Party Headquarters The Central Party Headquarters held a National Day memorial meeting yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. More than 600 people attended, including Chiang Kai-shek, Dai Chuanxian, Ding Weifen, Fang Juehui, Wang Boqun, Shao Lizi, Soong Ziwen, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Enhe Batu, Zhou Qigang, Zhang Daofan, Shao Yuanchong, and Kong Xiangxi. After the ceremony, Ding Weifen presided, and Dai Chuanxian gave a report, stating that the Republic of China had been born for twenty years, which, according to individuals, was the age of coming of age. It should be well constructed, but it has not yet reached the point of being an independent and free person. The people are very distressed. This year's National Day is being spent in the midst of national crisis. Our party feels an even greater responsibility and the work is even more arduous. From today onwards, everyone should be determined to be loyal to the country and filial to the nation, throw away the calculation of personal gain and focus on the task at hand. Only then can the national crisis be safely overcome and the future will still be bright. The more dangerous the situation, the more important order becomes, and the more important individual duties become. When disaster strikes, civil officials can live and die with the local people, and soldiers can live and die with their weapons. The national crisis can certainly be overcome and final victory can be achieved. Therefore, the most important thing now is to unite as one. This is the determination that everyone should have today, he said. Then the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Memorial Meeting of the Municipal Party Headquarters The Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters convened representatives from all walks of life yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. in the auditorium to hold a National Day memorial meeting. More than 400 people attended. Chairman Lai Lian delivered a speech, stating that this year's National Day is being spent in the midst of national crisis, and who is not saddened? We commemorate National Day and vow to wipe out the humiliation. We must constantly struggle. If we want to survive, we must overthrow Japanese imperialism. Then, Liu Manpo, a representative of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Association who had fled to Beijing, was introduced to report on the atrocities of the Japanese army. Then Lou Tongsun and others gave speeches. Then the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The water level in Wuhu city and rural areas is gradually receding, and the anti-Japanese national salvation movement is rising day by day. The Party Headquarters has convened meetings of all sectors to organize the Wuhu All Sectors Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army Committee. The original organizations of agriculture, industry, commerce, and students have been unified and merged, and it is scheduled to be officially established on the 12th. Propaganda teams from various schools have been dispatched to the city and suburbs for days, shouting themselves hoarse. When workers, peasants, and women hear about it, they all weep. Many have voluntarily organized frugal groups and ten-person national salvation groups to prepare for national salvation. Not buying Japanese goods has become a unanimous action. Japanese ships recently passing through Wuhu have no passengers or goods embarking or disembarking, and they come and go quietly. Today is the National Day of Double Ten, and all sectors have suspended celebrations due to the ongoing national crisis, and only hang flags and close businesses to express national mourning. In order to arouse the public to jointly go to the national crisis, the county party headquarters specially held the Wuhu All Sectors Double Ten Anti-Japanese National Salvation Conference at the sports field of the East Gate Vocational and Commercial School at 9:00 a.m. More than 30,000 people from all sectors of the public and school boy scouts attended, and there was almost no room to stand in the meeting place. First, the chairman reported on the significance of the meeting, and then the draft telegram of the meeting was read out and passed by the whole body. Then representatives of various groups took the stage one after another to speak and then dispersed. (10th)</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Identifies Enemy Goods The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee of this county has continuously inspected packages sent from Shanghai to Songjiang by postal mail at the transportation company, and found many pieces of suspected enemy goods such as undershirts and medicinal materials. The association had no way to judge, so Chang Mengxing and other members of the standing committee went to Shanghai to ask Ju Jiqiu, who had experience in identification from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, to come to Songjiang. Today (11th), they publicly inspected them one by one at the county party headquarters. Packages from Yuan Da Xin Ji and other three companies had one package of phonograph and more than ten pieces of unmarked cloth, which were quite suspicious. It was agreed that each piece should be cut off at the corner and taken to Shanghai for identification before further handling.</p>

<p>A Reward for Arresting Bandits Captured in Shanghai The vanguard officer Wang Yunlong of the 6th Team of the 2nd District of the Provincial Public Security Team stationed on the water in Wuxi received a confidential report the other day, stating that the bandit Zhou Changhai and his accomplice Fang Yiming were now fleeing to Shanghai. He requested that a team be sent to arrest them, and volunteered to lead the arrest. Upon receiving the report, Vanguard Officer Wang immediately took the team members and informants by car to Shanghai, and together with detectives from the British Concession police station, arrested the two bandits in Room 24 of the Ruizhong Hotel and escorted them to the police station. He then returned to Wuxi to report to the district office, and it was decided that they would take a document to Shanghai today (12th) to welcome them back and bring them to justice for interrogation. In addition, the bandit Zhou Changhai had been wanted by the county government of this county with a reward of 300 yuan.</p>

<p>Burning Two Batches of Enemy Goods The Inspection Section of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Wujin recently discovered a box of enemy goods such as porcelain and glassware, and also discovered eleven packages of Xiantao brand enemy yarn. At 10:00 a.m. on the Double Ten Festival, people from all walks of life were summoned to burn them at the public sports field. The porcelain and other items were also smashed. At that time, propaganda teams from various schools gave speeches on the spot, and everyone was moved.</p>

<p>Misunderstanding Between Students and the Chamber of Commerce The other day, the Anti-Japanese Association unfortunately had a dispute with the Chamber of Commerce due to the work of inspecting goods, as seen in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning around 8:00 a.m., the provincial government summoned Lu Xiaobo, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to the government by telephone to discuss the matter. Chairman Ye instructed him in person that in this time of trouble, merchants must operate their businesses with peace of mind and must not take any action that would cause accidents. Lu agreed to take full responsibility. After returning to the association, he convened a temporary meeting to report on the situation. After the meeting dispersed, at 1:30 p.m., male and female students from various schools lined up to shout slogans on South Ma Road until they reached the gate of the Chamber of Commerce. They unanimously demanded that Chairman Lu answer on the spot the meaning of yesterday's goods lifting. At this time, Chairman Lu was not in the association, and no one came forward. While they were in a stalemate, Standing Committee Member Hu Jianchun came to the association from outside. Many representatives ordered him to answer, but Hu said that he had not attended every meeting and replied that he was completely unaware of the situation. During the misunderstanding of words, it was inevitable that there were many people and hands, and Hu's face was slightly injured, and a piece of Hu's azure silk vest was torn. Then the provincial government persuaded the students to return first, and Hu went to the provincial party headquarters to resolve the matter together. The students from various schools then lined up and returned to school along West Gate Avenue. Hu immediately followed the provincial government's car to the provincial party headquarters to resolve everything.

<p>The Embezzlement Case of Burning Opium Still Has No Clue The Nantong County Court burned opium and discovered that more than 1,000 taels of opium had been embezzled.

<p>A Large Batch of Japanese Goods Seized and Confiscated The Hangzhou Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation received a confidential report yesterday that the Meiheng Soap Factory under the Guojun Bridge River was privately selling a large batch of Japanese goods. It secretly dispatched inspectors to investigate and found 80 baskets of the Japanese raw material called "hardened material" used to manufacture soap, worth more than 4,000 yuan. The factory was posing as butter to deceive and did not register or seal them. The Japanese goods were immediately taken to the association and confiscated in full. In addition, inspectors from the association checked the two refrigerators purchased by the Hangzhou Power Plant from Shanghai at the Zhakou, and they seemed to be Japanese goods. They were immediately detained pending a thorough investigation before disposal.</p>

<p>Treacherous Merchants Discovered Shipping Japanese Goods by Mail Since the Japanese army invaded the East, the treacherous merchants of this city have considered it a great opportunity and secretly purchased a large batch of Japanese goods from Shanghai for delivery by post, which has happened more than once. Yesterday, the Hengtai Xiang, Yuanchang Xiang, and Daheng silk and satin shops also imported more than 30 pieces of Japanese silk, which were still transshipped from Jiaxing. They were discovered and detained by the Jiaxing Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, which telegraphed the Pinghu Anti-Japanese Association to send personnel to the post office to receive them and punish the treacherous merchants according to law.</p>
<p>Troops Deployed to Zhapu Zhang Nanxian, Chairman of the Provincial Government, believes that the coastal and land defenses of the entire province are important due to the current invasion of our territory by the violent Japanese. He has transferred the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 7th Regiment of the Provincial Security Team to Zhapu to guard the coast to prevent Japanese warships from invading. He also ordered County Magistrate Wu to supervise the military and police to strictly guard against the winter defense period being handled earlier.</p>

<p>saying, "Gentlemen, today is the National Day memorial meeting for the 20th year of the Republic of China. When we think of the dangerous national status and the shaking national foundation of the Republic of China in its 20th year, and the urgency of internal and external troubles, not only is there no celebration to be had, but it is simply heartbreaking. Tears stream down our faces. Floods have reached sixteen provinces, affecting 60 to 70 million victims. Isn't this a huge internal trouble? Japanese imperialism has launched a large-scale invasion and occupation of the Eastern Provinces, losing thousands of miles of territory. The loss of people's lives and property is incalculable. Isn't this a huge external trouble? Therefore, today's National Day memorial is not a celebration, but only a lament. We cannot be sad, only strive. From today onwards, all citizens should take on two very important responsibilities. The first is that everyone should be of one mind and one heart to save the flood victims. The second is that all people should resist foreign insults with one heart. We sacrifice our lives, property, and energy to strive to complete these two major tasks, spraying our hot blood and heads and nailing them to these two heavy crucifixes. In previous National Days, we were always grand and joyful. This year's National Day is simply bleak, tragic, and extremely desolate. Compatriots, can you no longer wake up? Let us all loudly shout two slogans: first, unanimously strive to relieve the flood victims; second, unanimously strive to resist foreign insults. Otherwise, the suffering of the people of the Three Northeastern Provinces will immediately make the 400 million people of the whole country taste the suffering of national subjugation. The life of the nation and the glory of the country are all on our shoulders. We hope that everyone will rise up together. That's all."</p>

<p>Gu Mengyu and Huang Huabiao Accompanied Him</p>
<p>Took the Train to Beijing Last Night to Report His Mission</p>
<p>National Peace Is Expected to Be Realized</p>
<p>Wang, Sun, and Li are Waiting for Hu's Telegram in Guangzhou</p>
<p>Central Executive Committee member Chen Mingshu, accompanied by Central Supervisory Committee members Cai Yuanpei and Zhang Ji, went to Guangzhou with the Central Government's mission to negotiate peace. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Chen returned to Shanghai aboard the British ship "Gelifen." Accompanying him were Guangdong representative Gu Mengyu and his wife, Guangxi representative Huang Huabiao, and Chen's adjutants Pang Fei and Liu Shumo, a party of five. The detailed situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Met a Storm En Route Chen and others took the British ship to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 7th. It was rumored that they took the Dutch ship "Hualizhi Wang," which was not true. Although the Dutch ship sailed from Hong Kong on the same day, it will not arrive until this morning. The British ship "Gelifen" was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon the other day, but was delayed for a day due to a hurricane encountered en route. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 p.m., the ship arrived at Wusong. At 2:30 p.m., it docked at the Pudong Wharf in Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Welcome at the Wharf Yesterday, Mayor Zhang Qun, Central Executive Committee member Wu Tiecheng, and Jiang Haiguan Supervisor Tang Haian, representing Soong Ziwen, and Vice Commander Zhang's representative Luo Wengan and more than a dozen others took a specially prepared public safety launch from the new customs wharf across the river to board the ship to welcome them. At about 3:00 p.m., the welcoming party accompanied Chen and others back to the new customs wharf and took a car to the Cangzhou Hotel. Gu and Huang stayed at a friend's place.</p>
<p>Made a Statement Chen made a special statement yesterday, saying, "Question: Mr., what is the effect of your visit to Guangdong to discuss peace? Answer: Faced with national crisis, comrades from all parties in our party must unite in spirit and urgently seek peaceful unification. I am conveying the sincere intention of both parties to the same request, and I am not acting as a peace envoy. Question: Can peaceful unification be realized? Answer: The people of the whole country can consciously resist foreign enemies and yearn for peaceful unification. The Kuomintang is a party that should follow the trend and appeal to the people. How can it violate public sentiment? Since public sentiment is becoming unanimous, it will certainly succeed. Question: What method will be used to promote its realization? Answer: After I report my mission to Beijing, Mr. Chiang and Mr. Hu and others will schedule an appointment with comrades in Guangdong to meet in Shanghai with the two comrades Cai and Zhang, waiting for the Guangdong comrades to come. When the meeting is held, it will be the time when peaceful unification is realized. Question: When will you take up the post of garrison commander in Beijing and Shanghai? Answer: Not yet decided. When I take up this post, I must first resign from the Central Political Conference Committee and the National Government Committee. It is not appropriate to participate in national affairs while wholeheartedly guarding the central government, so as to avoid the suspicion of the military interfering in politics. It is also in line with my long-standing proposition of not holding military and political posts concurrently."</p>
<p>Meeting at Zhang's Residence Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m., Central Executive Committee members Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Zhang Jingjiang, and Chen Mingshu met at Zhang Jingjiang's residence on Masnan Road. Chen reported on the trip and discussed cooperation methods. They dispersed after two hours. Chu Minyi went to Zhang's residence once during the meeting, but soon left.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Talk Mr. Wu Tiecheng told our reporter yesterday that the peaceful unification of the country is extremely optimistic. Chen and others will take the train to Beijing tonight to report their mission. Mr. Hu will be able to come to Shanghai. After Hu arrives in Shanghai, the Guangdong comrades will send Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, and Li Wenfan to Shanghai to meet. The meeting place has not been decided in Beijing and Shanghai. It is generally more likely to be in Shanghai. The two comrades Cai and Zhang will come with Wang and others at that time.</p>
<p>Li Shizeng's Talk When the reporter met Mr. Li Shizeng yesterday, he said that Mr. Gu Mengyu is currently staying in Shanghai temporarily, waiting for the three comrades Wang, Sun, and Li to come to Shanghai. As for Mr. Hu's departure from Beijing to Shanghai, it is certainly not a problem. The detailed method will be determined after consultation with Chairman Chiang in Beijing.</p>
<p>Gu Mengyu's Talk Mr. Gu Mengyu told reporters yesterday that the public sentiment in Hong Kong and Guangdong is extremely agitated, and the hope for peaceful unification is particularly urgent. I came to Shanghai due to private friendship, not as a formal representative of Guangdong. The Guangdong side did not propose conditions, but a method. Now the Beijing side has Chen Mingshu in charge of guarding Beijing and Shanghai, and has allowed Mr. Hu to leave Beijing to come to Shanghai. Therefore, the Guangdong comrades have agreed to come to Shanghai for consultation. As for the personal issue of staying or leaving, it will be resolved publicly in the meeting. The rumors of assigning party, military, and political work are absolutely not true. After all, the government is a whole, how can it be forcibly divided? If that is the case, it is actually close to spoils sharing.</p>
<p>Left for Beijing Last Night Chen Mingshu, accompanied by Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jingjiang, Xiong Shihui, Luo Wengan, and Chen's secretary Sun Xiwu, took the night express to Beijing at 11:00 p.m. last night to meet with Chairman Chiang and report on the negotiations. The North Railway Station was temporarily under martial law last night, and the security was extremely tight.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Japanese Residents in Shanghai Provoke <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Following Yesterday's Residents' General Meeting</p>
<p>Forcibly Tear Down Slogans</p>
<p>Wanton Abuse</p>
<p>Kick and Injure Chinese</p>
<p>Japanese residents in Shanghai held a general meeting at the Japanese Elementary School on North Sichuan Road at 1 PM yesterday to discuss how to counter our country's anti-Japanese national salvation movement. After the meeting, several hundred Japanese marched south along North Sichuan Road, forcibly tearing down patriotic slogans posted by various shops, provoking incidents in every possible way. Japanese Marines specially dispatched armed soldiers in military vehicles, following behind the Japanese who were causing trouble, demonstrating along the road. For a time, the situation was tense and order was disrupted along North Sichuan Road from Yokohama Bridge to Pengpu Road. Shops closed their doors one after another to temporarily avoid their aggression. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forcibly Tearing Down Slogans The location where the Japanese held their meeting was the Northern Japanese Elementary School at No. 141 North Sichuan Road, north of Yokohama Bridge. From noon yesterday, a large number of Japanese Marines, armed with guns and live ammunition, were stationed along the road. Except for Japanese attendees, Chinese were unable to pass. The meeting began around 3 PM and concluded. Then, three to four hundred Japanese attendees formed small groups and headed south, forcibly tearing down patriotic slogans posted by Chinese shops along the roadside, regardless of reason, and wantonly abusing them verbally, making it impossible to reason with them.</p>
<p>Deliberately Provoking Incidents Starting from Yokohama Bridge, many Chinese shops along the way were harassed by the Japanese. The large group suddenly stopped in front of the Jiande Apartment at No. 713. Immediately, several Japanese thugs climbed onto the copper railings outside the glass window and tore down the large-character banner "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Propaganda Team Stationed Here" and various slogans posted on it. Hundreds of Japanese onlookers clapped and cheered.</p>
<p>Shops Close Their Doors Taking advantage of the situation, the Japanese marched towards Bazili Road. When they reached the southern end of Qiujiang Road, they invaded the Lianchang Hardware Store at No. 516 again, tearing down slogans and harassing them in every possible way. At this time, shops closed their doors one after another to avoid their aggression and temporarily suspended business. However, over a hundred Japanese swaggered south from Bazili Road.</p>
<p>Kicking and Injuring Shop Assistants When they arrived at the Wang Shengtie Western Clothing Store near Pengpu Road, the store was preparing to close its iron gate. The Japanese, regardless of everything, forcibly tried to tear down the slogans pasted inside the glass window. Wang Huihua, the small shop owner, was unable to stop them and was kicked in the lower abdomen. Wang Xianqing's left hand was also struck, causing a lot of bleeding. They were both examined by a Western doctor, and a letter was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Taxpaying Chinese Association, the Citizens' Federation, and the Anti-Japanese Association, urging them to actively negotiate.</p>
<p>Armed Demonstration When the Japanese were tearing down slogans in groups, armed Marines in military vehicles provided cover behind them and demonstrated along the way. The concession police also dispatched detectives to disperse the Japanese and maintain order when they caused trouble.</p>
<p>Extreme Prevention On both sides of North Sichuan Road, the area belongs to the Chinese territory. When something happened, the heads of the fifth district, the first branch of the fifth district, and the second branch of the fifth district of the Public Security Bureau warned the police to take extreme precautions and, after the incident, persuaded the shops to open their doors and restore the original state. Chen Xizeng, the head of the Public Security Bureau, also went to Zhabei to investigate the truth after receiving the news and will submit a request to the municipal government to protest to the Japanese consulate.</p>
<p>What Was Heard at the Meeting It was heard that the Japanese residents' general meeting yesterday was attended by store owners and employees of various Japanese shops, heads of various households, and consular military and police officials, totaling more than 7,000 people. The venue was heavily guarded. The most important resolution was to send a telegram to the Tokyo government, stating that the lives and property of residents in Shanghai are in imminent danger, and requesting that decisive action be taken against the anti-Japanese national salvation movement in China. It was also said that after the meeting, the Japanese, because our country's anti-Japanese national salvation movement has been strictly maintaining order and there is no opportunity to take advantage of, and because they are feeling the impact of the major boycott of Japanese goods, had no choice but to deliberately provoke incidents to find an excuse, hence the action of marching in groups and forcibly tearing down slogans.</p>

Of the 400 Marines brought by the Tokiwa, 240 landed at Huishan Wharf at around 4 PM on the day of arrival and took cars to the barracks in front of Hongkou Park at the end of North Sichuan Road.

(3) (Foreign firm personnel) After Japanese goods become sluggish, Western goods will definitely flourish, and the number of Western firm employees should be increased. Please ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find a way to introduce them. (4) (Seamen) You can directly send letters to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Sanbei Steamship Company, and the Shipping Association.

Resolved: This association will send a telegram to overseas Chinese chambers of commerce. (6) How to avoid loading foreign orders on Japanese ships.

<p>The First Regiment's Organization Is Ready</p>
<p>Speeches Were Given Yesterday at the Public Sports Ground</p>
<p>According to 국민社 (National Society), the National Salvation Volunteer Army Committee, sponsored by the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, gave speeches at the Public Sports Ground to more than 1,000 volunteer soldiers of the First Regiment that has been organized. Prior to this, the committee appointed Zhou Yanan as the commander of the regiment, Deng Jinglie, Huang Dapeng, Zheng Xingli, Xu Tao, Cheng Xiuyan, Sheng Duhu, Peng Yangwu, Mo Caiwen, Li Shuming, Chu Jinming, Yang Yinmin, and Wu Yan as squadron leaders. Committee members Chen Yafu and Li Cishan gave training, briefly stating, "Comrades, today is the first time that the Shanghai National Salvation Volunteer Army Committee has organized a large gathering of soldiers who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the country after being organized by the Compilation Office. It is also the day when training will begin for future combat. At this time when the situation and environment are precarious, comrades, you have enthusiastically come to gather here early in the morning. This spirit is gratifying. The Japanese are taking advantage of our China's natural and man-made disasters with an aggressive Manchurian-Mongolian policy, using troops to invade and occupy the three northeastern provinces without any conscience, seizing land, burning cities, killing and capturing people, doing what humans are unwilling to do. After this unfortunate news came, the people of the whole country, no matter who they were, embraced infinite grief and were extremely willing to fight the Japanese to the death. This time, the troops in the three northeastern provinces surrendered the great territory to the Japanese without resistance, which made our people even more grieved and humiliated. The Chinese people's weakness is so obvious that it makes us weep bitterly. We are now organizing a volunteer army. This organization is the strength of the people. With the strength of an entire people, we can go to the national crisis together and save the country with all our strength. The mission and responsibility of each volunteer soldier is very important. We should shoulder this great mission and responsibility of saving the country, saving the nation, and saving ourselves. Once we have shouldered it on our shoulders, we will not fear anything, sacrifice ourselves desperately, and absolutely not shrink back or be afraid of death. In short, we must love our motherland. We must resist with the strength of the entire nation, the entire organized and trained force. It is not enough to save this critical situation. Not only must we expel the Japanese troops from the three northeastern provinces and return our territory, but we must also take on all the great missions and responsibilities of the future with a persistent spirit," and so on. Next, Committee member Li Cishan and others gave training, and then the team was organized and dismissed. It is heard that the association is now planning to compile the unorganized volunteer soldiers into the second, third, and other regiments. It has been decided that the first regiment, which has been fully compiled, will begin training on the 15th of this month.</p>

As long as I have a breath left, I will vow to deal with it. In the face of the great enemy, I hope that we can encourage each other. Please give me more guidance so that I can be encouraged.

<h3 id="e112">General Assembly of Stranded Employees of the Shenyang Arsenal <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Going to the Municipal Government Today to Petition</p>
<p>Requesting Measures to Maintain Livelihood</p>
<p>After the violent Japanese forcibly occupied Liaoning, more than 2,100 people who had escaped from the Shenyang Arsenal had come to Shanghai. For the sake of livelihood, a general meeting was held the day before yesterday to discuss measures, and it was decided to go to the municipal government today to petition. The details of the various situations are recorded below.</p>
<p>General Assembly At 9 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, a general assembly of all stranded personnel was convened at the Qu Zhenren Temple, with more than 700 people attending. Dai Xiuqi was publicly elected as the chairman. First, the chairman reported on the experiences of being stranded and the purpose of the meeting, and then the discussion began. It was resolved: (1) Wang Wenlong, Dai Xiuqi, Lu Youke, Zhang Longshun, Zhu Qiming, Yu Guilin, and other six people were designated as responsible representatives of all stranded personnel. (2) It was decided to go to the municipal government to petition on the 12th. (3) Wang Yongtao and Wu Shunfu were designated as leaders during the petition. (4) Zhang Tai'an, Qu Jinshan, Xie Qingtian, Liu Caiqin, Chen Qikai, and Gu Changde were designated as inspectors during the petition.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government The stranded personnel of the Shenyang Arsenal decided to gather at the Qu Zhenren Temple at 8 AM this morning and go to the municipal government to petition at 10 AM. The text of the petition is recorded as follows: "We are submitting this petition because we were driven out by the violent Japanese and are displaced. We cry all the way and sincerely request relief to maintain our lives. Since the Japanese invaders used conspiracies and coercive means to invade and occupy Shenyang, slaughter our soldiers and civilians, occupy our factories, and seize our weapons, their various atrocities are too numerous to mention. All those with blood and qi feel heartbroken when they speak of it and gnash their teeth when they hear of it. Moreover, the representatives and other workers are employed in the provincial arsenal and have been personally harmed. They all want to eat the flesh and sleep on the skin of the Japanese and be satisfied. Now that the national crisis is imminent, we are not concerned about our family difficulties. We only think that the reason why our country is weak and despised by others is that although there are more than one reason, the most important reason is the lack of elite military strength. The representatives and others belong to the workers and should fulfill the obligations of the workers, but the Fengtian Arsenal has been lost and there is no way to serve the country. We can only call for nothing. Therefore, more than 2,000 people who have escaped to Shanghai have been living in thatched huts in places such as the Qu Zhenren Temple on Xiejiao Road, sleeping on the ground and having no rice to cook. The pain is indescribable. Yesterday, all the stranded employees were convened to hold a meeting and decided to first petition the government, requesting: (1) The stranded employees who have come to Shanghai are all from other provinces and are stranded in the middle of the road, suffering from cold and hunger. We request that food be distributed daily from now on to maintain the status quo and protect our lives. (2) The workers will go to Beijing to petition, requesting notification from the Jinghu Railway Bureau to issue free round-trip train tickets. (3) The workers have worked in the Feng factory for two and a half months and have not been paid. We request that the government forward a telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang to pay the arrears so that the family members can be safely sent back to their hometowns. (4) The workers originally belonged to the workers and have some experience in manufacturing weapons. We request that measures be taken to accommodate them to assist the country's work and fulfill their own livelihood. It is really convenient for both public morality. The matter is urgent. We crawl on the ground and wait for orders. We cannot bear to pray for the utmost."</p>

<h3 id="e117">Zhabei Military Police Corps Joint Defense Meeting <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Infantry Second Regiment of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Police Corps, stationed in the Qianjiang Guild Hall on Taiyangmiao Road in Zhabei, which is responsible for guarding the Northern Shanghai District, convened its first joint defense meeting of military police corps yesterday. The meeting was attended by more than twenty people, including the regimental and battalion commanders of the Second Regiment, Gu Dinghua, Wu Guanzhou, Teng Tieshan, Li Weiping, Liu Tianshao, Song Zhuoyu, Li Tiezheng, Liu Dongxuan, Shen Yulin of the Second Battalion of the Military Police, Han Tiexian and Liu Guoshu of the Fourth and Fifth Police Districts, Wang Xisan of the police offices of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, and Bu Liheng and Li Xiuling of the Shanghai North Defense Corps. After the ceremonial procedures, Chairman Colonel Gu reported that his regiment was ordered to be responsible for security in the Northern Shanghai area, in accordance with Article 6 of the Shanghai Garrison Command's security plan, which stipulates that the security forces in each district should convene a defense meeting once a week with local military police agencies within their respective districts. Moreover, as his regiment had just arrived in this area, it was not familiar with the local situation, and at a time when the situation was turbulent, there were many things that needed to be discussed with everyone. Furthermore, with the Japanese invasion of our Northeast, all citizens are filled with righteous indignation, and the indignation of our armed comrades must be even deeper. They should be the vanguard of the people and annihilate these tyrannical elements. However, before receiving orders from the central government, we should do our best to avoid meaningless conflicts, which would disrupt the national plan. Recently, students from various schools in Shanghai and other places have organized propaganda teams to publicize everywhere in order to awaken compatriots and inspire popular morale, and they should be protected. He noted that there are many Japanese residents and soldiers in Shanghai, and conflicts may inevitably occur. The police should pay special attention to protecting Japanese residents properly before relations are severed in order to avoid complications. The current order in each district will be maintained by the police for the time being, and the troops will provide assistance at any time if needed. The discussion then proceeded as follows: (1) The Northern Shanghai District is vast, and the military police are scattered. How should they communicate? Resolution: Each agency will draw a rough map of the deployment locations of its forces and fill in telephone numbers, which will be sent to the regimental headquarters for compilation and distribution to the responsible officials for reference. At the same time, a request will be submitted to the Garrison Command, instructing the Zhabei Telephone Bureau to connect telephone lines to facilitate communication between them; (2) All units should still be on alert at all times and await orders; (3) How to clarify the situation in each location? Resolution: In addition to the regimental headquarters sending plainclothes detectives to conduct reconnaissance in different directions, each agency should promptly communicate with each other using the simplest methods if they hear anything; (4) Prohibit soldiers in uniform from entering the concession and arresting soldiers who are out without symbols to prevent trouble? Resolution: It is easiest to cause misunderstandings when soldiers in uniform enter the concession, and the police should dissuade them. If they do not listen, they can be detained and sent to the regimental headquarters for processing. If soldiers are seen without insignia, they should be immediately detained and sent to their respective agencies for strict handling; (5) Omitted; (6) How to devise simple communication methods for ordinary times for use in emergencies? Resolution: In the event of a major event requiring troop assistance and the telephone cannot be used, the facts can be recorded, omitting unnecessary details, and only the time, address, and event should be clearly stated and sent by letter to the nearest garrison in each district for immediate assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Case of the Great China Rubber Factory <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Conference Decides on Disposal Method</p>
<p>The factory has been ordered to resume work immediately.</p>
<p>Because the Great China Rubber Factory previously had a small amount of Japanese raw materials in stock (such as red lining cloth, which has now been abandoned), someone reported it to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. It happened that the factory's manager, Nie Fuji, was representing the rubber industry trade association at the Domestic Goods Manufacturers' Congress. The Anti-Japanese Association ordered him to temporarily seal the small amount of old Japanese raw materials in stock. As previously reported, it is heard that the Anti-Japanese Association sent people to the factory to investigate and learned that the factory had been determined to improve its products since its opening to achieve the goal of completely domestic goods. However, in terms of raw materials, except for calcium carbonate, which is manufactured in a factory in Rihuigang and can be supplied, the rest are ordered from Western merchants and will be available in Shanghai soon. In order to protect domestic goods and the livelihoods of the factory workers, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association decided at its regular meeting to order the factory to resume work immediately to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. The factory's small amount of raw materials will be jointly re-examined and unsealed by the Inspection and Investigation Departments. After receiving the notice, the factory has already complied with it.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Group's (50th Group) proposed plan for the third term of member recruitment was submitted to the Chamber of Commerce's standing committee meeting and approved. The Chamber of Commerce issued a circular to the city's businesses, encouraging young merchants to come to the group for training as much as possible and allowing them to act freely when it does not conflict with work time to facilitate training. The group has now published recruitment advertisements in newspapers starting today. It is also heard that the group's "Information for Joining the Group" has been printed, and those seeking to read it have been coming in droves, which shows that businessmen nowadays value training for merchant boy scouts.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Oppose Changzhou Cocoon Business Tax <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from its members, the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association stated that when purchasing autumn cocoons from Changzhou County, they were illegally extorted by business tax collectors, resulting in the seizure of boats. They telegraphed the National Government Finance Ministry, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Finance Department, and the Changzhou County Government yesterday, instructing them to investigate and handle the matter. The telegram stated that the Yigong Silk Factory reported that recently, when purchasing autumn cocoons from various villages in Changzhou County, Jiangsu Province, they were illegally extorted by local collectors of business taxes, resulting in boat seizures and fines. The business tax authority employs former liquor tax office staff who regard extorting merchant ships as their usual practice. In addition to harassing cocoon merchants, they have also established patrol boats at Henglin, Zhoutieqiao, Anqiao, and Jujiangqiao in the county to arbitrarily demand money from passing cocoon boats. Even cocoon boats purchased from Yixing County are not exempt. If they are slightly dissatisfied, they seize the boats and impose heavy fines. If the tax ticket is not carried on the boat or if the goods of one shipment are shipped in batches and the tax ticket cannot be prepared for each boat, then each boat is fined 30 yuan, 28 yuan, or 16 yuan. Even if a tax ticket is carried on the boat, a handling fee of 2 yuan must be paid per boat. Such open extortion is utterly unscrupulous and cannot be tolerated under the flag of honesty. It is requested to forward the matter to the government and order a stop to this and to investigate and severely punish the violators to demonstrate fairness and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It was decided at the 12th temporary representative assembly on the 3rd of this month to submit the matter to request a thorough investigation. The practice of collecting liquor tax was the most notorious during the Qing Dynasty, and our government, regretting its harm to the country and its damage to merchants, followed the guidelines of the late Prime Minister and resolutely abolished it. It is unimaginable that the Changzhou County business tax office is now resuming its old tricks, and it is no wonder that merchants and people are heartbroken. According to the report, it is requested to order a stop to this and thoroughly investigate and handle the matter.</p>

The corps has a glorious history and is a group of citizens, and it is not appropriate to suspend it for a long time. Therefore, the meeting was convened for joint discussion. As a result of the meeting, a restoration committee was organized, named the French Concession Chinese Volunteer Corps Restoration Movement Association, to carry out all restoration matters and to send a letter to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association and a document to the French Consul General, Mr. Grogelin, and the Police Chief, Mr. Favreau, requesting that people of integrity and prestige in the concession be appointed as soon as possible to restore the corps' duties immediately so that the spirit of the corps in the past can be maintained and the security of the concession can be greatly assisted. It happened to be raining heavily at the time of the meeting, and all the members came in the rain, which is truly admirable.</p>

<p>To be transported to various disaster areas for distribution after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that local newspapers have previously reported that the first batch of American wheat would arrive in Shanghai, and the authorities were planning to sell the wheat on the market. The National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee considers this unfounded rumor to be baseless and sufficient to disrupt the market. It is hereby denied. Regarding the use of American wheat, Article 7 of the contract (already seen in various newspapers) stipulates that it is exclusively for charitable relief in Chinese water disaster areas, with a clear meaning. It is reported that the first batch of 8,000 tons of relief wheat has been shipped from Seattle on the slave-operated Aola steamboat. It will be transported to various disaster areas for distribution after arriving in Shanghai at the end of this month to implement the policy of work relief.</p>

<p>He went to Yangzhou, Gaoyou, and Baoying to inspect the conditions of the shelters and set off yesterday.

<p>Disaster victims from Hubei and Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Disaster Victim Reception Office received disaster victims at Liuying Road, Zhabei, there have been more than 5,000 people.

It was agreed that the water in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has receded, and all disaster victims from those areas should stop being received and be sent back. The day before yesterday, more than 180 disaster victims from Henan and northern Anhui were contacted by the railway bureau to arrange vehicles to transfer to Beijing and return to their hometowns.

<p>The north wind rages, and it is difficult to endure the cold.</p>
<p>Disaster victims do not have to worry about thin clothes.</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee has begun collecting old clothes for relief, and donations are extremely enthusiastic. It is said that this type of work is handled by the procurement section of the finance group of the association. The steps and procedures are extremely well organized. It is estimated that there are more than 60 Chinese and Western groups and churches in this city that are responsible for collecting clothing items on behalf of the association. As of the beginning of this month, more than 50,000 pieces of old clothing have been received, of which the Zheng Yan Association on Nanxun Road collected the most, reaching more than 20,000 pieces. Their enthusiasm is commendable. The association has already transported 5,000 pieces of old clothing to Anqing and 5,000 pieces to Wuhu. There are still 40,000 pieces that have been scheduled to be transported to Hunan (30,000 pieces) and Zhenjiang (10,000 pieces).

<h3 id="e145">Representatives from Northern Anhui Come to Shanghai to Beg for Relief <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Northern Anhui 21-County Water Disaster Aftermath Committee has elected Gao Weixuan, Chen Ziheng, Yang Yaonan, and Li Zhuxi as representatives to go to Beijing and Shanghai to beg for relief. It is learned that the representatives have arrived in Beijing from Bengbu and petitioned various agencies. They came to Shanghai yesterday and presented documents to the National Government Water Disaster Relief Association, the Relief Committee, the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Emergency Relief of Water Disasters in Various Provinces, the Anhui Water Disaster Relief Association, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, the Red Cross Society, the Jisheng Association, and various charitable organizations. They wrote that this year's flood disaster was particularly severe in Anhui, especially in the 21 counties in northern Anhui, which are located in a remote corner along the Huai River. The disaster area is more than 800 miles long. Because the electric poles were broken and the shipping was suspended, transportation was gradually cut off, and communication was interrupted. The people along the Huai River are struggling to survive and have no time to promote their plight. Therefore, the outside world knows little about it, unlike the Wuhan disaster, which was witnessed by people from China and abroad. The breaches of the Wuhu weirs in southern Anhui have received special attention from the provincial government. It is found that Anhui Province is listed as a severely affected province this year, and the 21 counties in northern Anhui, where the Huai River overflowed and formed a swamp, are indeed severely affected. Therefore, people from China and abroad agree that the first batch of 170,000 yuan allocated by the National Government for emergency relief was allocated by the Anhui Province Relief Commissioner without detailed investigation. The relief was distributed in the provincial capital. The 20 counties in central and southern Anhui received 90,000 yuan in relief funds, while the 21 counties in northern Anhui only received 50,000 yuan. Only the 53 counties of Shouhuo and the town of Linhuai received practical benefits. The other counties all suffered from a lack of assistance. However, it can be said that during the height of the flood, emergency relief was difficult to extend. The relief officials and the investigators sent by the provincial government were unable to conduct field investigations due to traffic obstruction or time constraints. Therefore, the distribution of emergency relief was not average. Winter and spring relief can be a second step to remedy this. Disaster relief is related to the lives of the people, and the relief personnel bear a heavy responsibility. They cannot determine the severity of the disaster based on the presence or absence of publicity. Those in charge of Anhui did not conduct a thorough investigation beforehand, nor did they hear of any remedial measures afterward. The second distribution of relief funds took the first as an example. According to the truth, how can it be said to be fair? Recently, various counties in northern Anhui have reported to the association that the entire disaster area in northern Anhui, whether the counties along the Huai River or the low-lying areas of the tributaries of the Huai River, are still flooded. It is not difficult to ask for the dispatch of commissioners to investigate each county. The representatives have been entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the disaster victims in each county, and they feel terrified at night. They have always admired your association's compassion and treated everyone equally. You are very concerned about the disaster situation in Anhui, and the disaster situation in northern Anhui is more severe than in southern and central Anhui. It is expected that you have long been aware of it. It is reasonable to base it on the facts, represent the public opinion, and believe that the relief funds for northern Anhui should not be distributed equally with those for central and southern Anhui. The reasons are written and sincerely request your association to send personnel to investigate thoroughly and provide prompt relief to value the lives of the people and show fairness. We are extremely urgent and await your orders.</p>

<p>General Zhu Ziqiao's Grand Ambition</p>
<p>To be undertaken by the Buddhist Studies Bookstore</p>
<p>The only remaining Zhu-printed Buddhist complete canon in our country is still stored in the Wolong Temple and Xian Temple in Xi'an. Kang Nanhai wanted to reproduce it by photocopying but failed. Indeed, this great canon is the only precious treasure in our country. Last year, General Zhu Ziqiao released relief to Shaanxi, saw it, and was pleasantly surprised. He urgently wanted to reproduce and circulate it, and he discussed it with believers in various places who were very enthusiastic. This year, he came to Shanghai and had earnest discussions with religious and charitable circles in Shanghai. After several meetings, it was decided to use lithography to print a quarto edition, each copy costing about 500 yuan, which is ten times cheaper than the Qing Dynasty Dragon Canon and can obtain a Song Dynasty carved edition. It is expected that circulation will be very prosperous. It is reported that the book has been decided to be undertaken by the Buddhist Studies Bookstore in this city.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Ma Er, the Murderer in the Smuggling Case, Still Tries to Deny It <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>He Robbed Property and Injured Two Lives. The Witness's Testimony is Conclusive. The Judge Says, "Your Conscience is Too Bad."</p>
<p>Ma Er, a Tongzhou native and the rickshaw driver of Cai Zhitian, a Chinese detective at the Huishan Police Station, gathered accomplices and went to the western-style house on the second floor of Yichang Electric Company, 196 East Seward Road, at about 1 a.m. on the 19th of last month. They killed Gu Cao, Zhu's relative, and Zhou Lushi, the maid, and robbed jewelry worth more than 1,000 yuan. After the case was discovered, Ma was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Details have been reported in this newspaper. The police station summoned witnesses and the owner the day before yesterday and sent Ma Er again to the Fifth Criminal Court for investigation. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, stated that there were two witnesses who could prove that the blood-stained clothes seized were worn by Ma in the past. The date was changed to bail out the original stolen goods, a coat made of Yuan silk and satin fur, from a certain pawnshop for 8 yuan. The clothes, the white cloth belt worn by Ma (because there were blood spots), the short-sleeved shirt with blood stains, the murder weapon, etc., were presented for inspection. According to Zhu Yangshan, a native of Qingpu, Gu Cao, the victim, was his maternal aunt, and Zhou Lushi was a maid. At the time of the incident, he had gone to Wuxi on business and returned to Shanghai on the 20th. He observed that the thieves had entered from the rear of the house by dismantling the fence at the top of the wall. More than 1,000 yuan of property was robbed. As for the 500 yuan in banknotes, there was no such amount. The three-year-old child who had not suffered was Gu Cao's son. He had never met the defendant before. The child pointed to the window, saying "that afternoon", etc. According to Cai, the detective, the defendant had been a rickshaw driver at his place for more than eleven months. He did not work badly in the past, but suddenly changed recently. After the incident, he looked panicked. A blood-stained short-sleeved shirt with a patched place was found in Zhu's house. He recalled that Ma usually wore it, and that's how he was arrested. There are now two witnesses in court who can testify. However, when searching his bedroom after the incident, there were no stolen goods or silver dollars. He went out for three nights between the 10th and 20th of last month, and it is not known what he was doing. According to Xiao Cao, who worked as a laundryman at Cai's detective office, he washed the blood-stained short-sleeved shirt three times, so he recognized it without error. In the past, he could eat three or four bowls of rice per meal, but after the incident, he only ate one bowl, a significant decrease. He was asked to sign a statement. According to Gu Afu, who worked as a rickshaw driver at Shi Huanting's detective office at the Huishan Police Station, he saw Ma every day when he went to the police station and talked and laughed. He saw a hole in the pocket of the white cloth short-sleeved shirt he was wearing, which was the blood-stained clothes presented in court. After speaking, he was also asked to sign a statement. When questioned, Ma Er firmly denied that the blood-stained clothes belonged to him and tried to deny it in every possible way. Judge Shen Bingrong declared that this case was indeed a case of "Heaven's net is wide, and though its meshes are coarse, nothing can slip through." He was arrested because of the clothes. Otherwise, he would still be at large. "You have a very bad conscience. You robbed property and injured two lives. There is no need to deny it now. Confess who the mastermind is or who fooled you so that you can reduce your sentence." Ma Er categorically denied it. According to Banas, the Western detective of the General Department, on the 25th of last month, he and Chief Detective Mike, Chinese Detective Tang Jian, and Detective Cai went to the victim's home with the defendant, who pointed out where he had entered, and the details of killing the two women, robbing the clothes, packing them in a box, and first going out to see if there were any patrols, etc. There was no coercion, etc. Judge Shen instructed that he should be sent back into custody and rescheduled for another hearing.</p>

<p>Losses of more than 90,000 yuan, to be scheduled for trial separately.</p>
<p>Hua, the Chinese detective of the Xinzha Police Station, recently arrested the bandits Yan Haosong (aka Sun Zhongcai), Ma Yuxue (aka Ma Yugong), Guan Liu (aka Big Braid), Wang Huaiqing, Lu Dezhi, and Lu's wife Zhang, six men and women. After investigation, they had committed a total of twelve armed robbery cases. The owners were (1) Ji Rongkang, 856 Dagu Road; (2) Cao Jishou, 32 Fuxu Road; (3) Zhang Shaotong, 931 Nanjing Road; (4) Ding Baoxiang, 295 Fuzhou Road; (5) Zhou Yufu, 611 Nanjing Road; (6) Xu Yongchun, 13 Shanxi Road; (7) Wang Laosan, 114 Hubei Road; (8) Yu Baokun, 284 Beihai Road; (5) Zhu Fujin, 408 Lahai Road; (10) Wang Xufu, 12 Beijing Road; (11) Shi Shigui, 213 Zhejiang Road; (12) Bao Zhongyu, 67 Xizang Road. Wang Xufu suffered the most significant loss, with losses of banknotes and gold bars worth more than 92,500 yuan. The losses of the other households ranged from several hundred to dozens of dollars. The Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case summoned the owners a few days ago and sent Yan and the other six to the First Special District Local Court. After being questioned by Judge Wu, it was decided to hold a special court hearing on the 22nd of next month due to the large number of witnesses. The robbers were sent back into custody.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Tianjin Woman Asks for Mediation to Break Away from Family Relationship <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Unable to Bear the Abuse of the Eldest Wife, Both Parties Agreed to Mediation.</p>
<p>Liang Guizhen, a woman from Tianjin, hired a lawyer to file a petition with the Mediation Court of the Second Special District Court to request to break away from the family relationship of her husband, Li Zhengzhi. The petition for mediation is recorded as follows: "Unable to bear the trampling of women, the authority of the eldest wife, and the abuse of the husband, I request mediation to break away from the family relationship. I, the petitioner, lost my mother at the age of three and my father at the age of twelve. At the age of sixteen, I was controlled by the old family and married to the respondent due to the sweet talk of my late mother and matchmaker. When the marriage was discussed, it was claimed to be the original match, but unexpectedly, three days after entering the door, the respondent's eldest wife came from Shandong to Tianjin and lived with the petitioner. At that time, the petitioner knew that she was weak in knowledge and encountered misfortune, but the die was cast, and the rice was cooked. It was useless to cry out in vain. Thinking late at night, I sighed that my fate was thin and hated who to blame. I only hoped that the respondent would be considerate and try to comfort me. My lifelong grievances could also be resolved. How could I expect that the petitioner's thoughts were so, but the opposite was true? Not long after the marriage, I moved to Shanghai with the eldest wife. Then the respondent was unemployed and in difficulty, so he pawned and borrowed money to make a living, which led to a high debt platform, and often beat the petitioner for no reason, and the eldest wife helped to cheer, arbitrarily insulting. Under this tyranny, several years have passed. Now the respondent is accustomed to humiliation and has become more and more tyrannical. On the 19th of last month, I was beaten severely again, and the petitioner went to Heji Hospital for treatment. There is now an injury certificate to prove it. He thinks of women as toys, oblivious to pity, and the eldest wife treats the petitioner as inferior, almost like a servant. How can I endure this life? I have no choice but to request permission to break away from the family relationship." The court, according to the petition, summoned both parties to court for mediation the day before yesterday. According to Liang Guizhen, she is twenty-one years old this year and married the respondent at the age of sixteen. After entering the door, she unexpectedly learned that the respondent already had an eldest wife. At that time, the woman thought that the die was cast, so she endured it. However, she was often subjected to various abuses by her husband and the eldest wife, and the real situation made it impossible to live together. Therefore, I came to the case to request separation, etc. When asked, Li Zhengzhi, a native of Shandong, stated that he is now practicing medicine at 96 Yongyu Lane, West Gate Road. Five years ago, he married the petitioner as his wife, and there is an official marriage certificate to prove it. After moving to Shanghai and living together, his wife often went out alone on the pretext of watching a movie and returned home late at night. Therefore, the merchant has repeatedly scolded her, but he has not dared to abuse her. The petitioner's request for separation is difficult to accept. I request that the petitioner be ordered to return home and live together. Judge Qu persuaded both parties for a while, and as a result, both parties agreed to reschedule the mediation, and the court approved it.</p>

Fortunately, the force was not very strong, and only his fingers were slightly injured. He was found by a nearby patrolman and sent to the Songshan Road Police Station and then to the hospital. Because the injury was very minor, he was bandaged and discharged from the hospital immediately.</p>

<p>Previously, a certain person, identified as Person A, went to Room 7 of the company building at 371 Avenue Albert, in the French Concession, to solicit donations from a Westerner, Mr. Mamuya. Person A claimed to be a staff member of the Nanjing Buddhist Orphanage and that the orphanage was facing financial difficulties, so he was appealing to philanthropists from all walks of life to support the cause. Mr. Mamuya immediately asked Person A about his occupation. Person A, upon hearing that Mr. Mamuya worked in the political department of the police station, became evasive and hastily took his leave. Mr. Mamuya was very suspicious and immediately sent a letter of inquiry to the Nanjing Buddhist Orphanage. The orphanage has now replied: "Respectfully, we received your letter inquiring whether our orphanage has sent anyone to Shanghai to solicit donations. In response, we have investigated and found that our orphanage has never sent anyone to Shanghai to solicit donations. If anyone is found impersonating us to commit fraud, we hope that you will immediately investigate and arrest them for severe punishment, to deter such wicked practices. We would be most grateful. This is a special reply. We hope you will take note of this. To the Special Political Department of the French Police Station. Nanjing Buddhist Orphanage. October 9th," and so on. Recently, the decline of moral standards and the prevalence of swindling have been frequently reported. The French Concession authorities have now ordered all police detectives to thoroughly investigate and arrest such individuals and hand them over to the nearest police station for severe punishment.</p>

<p>Reader's Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e163">Mr. Zhang Xutang (The Fundamental Blueprint for Resistance and National Salvation) <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>People must insult themselves before others insult them. Is not the current forceful occupation of the Northeast by the violent Japanese due to our country's endless internal strife, inviting humiliation upon ourselves? Like a bolt from the blue, awakening from a deep sleep, our compatriots now know that without resistance and national salvation, there is no way to survive. However, upon detailed examination, where exactly lies the weakness of our compatriots? It is none other than the selfish and self-interested thoughts and behaviors engendered by the ancient inherited concepts of family and individual. The concept of selfishness and self-interest has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. Furthermore, with the economic oppression from foreign countries and the increasingly difficult social life, the concept of selfishness and self-interest is becoming increasingly rampant, to the point that all compatriots throughout the country only know how to create personal comfort, raise offspring in luxury, and ensure the family's wealth and honor for generations, while regarding the chaos and decline of the country and society and the poverty and suffering of compatriots as irrelevant. Alas, in this world of the survival of the fittest, what kind of strength and achievements can be expected from a nation of selfish and self-interested people who organize a government and maintain society? Therefore, if the Chinese people want to resist Japan and save the country today, they must first abolish this evil concept. In the past, all compatriots, regardless of their background, should ask themselves honestly whether they have made mistakes. In the face of national crisis, as long as they awaken and repent from now on, all past debts should be forgiven (except for unrepentant communists). Starting anew, everyone should vow to unite as one, moving forward on the path of great impartiality, mutual assistance, mutual love, and shared existence and prosperity. Only then can the nation have hope for self-strengthening. However, to achieve this goal, it is essential to publicly define a common goal to serve as a model and example for promotion and common adherence. I hereby propose the following in brief, and I hope to discuss them with compatriots throughout the country: (1) All adult male and female citizens of the Republic of China who have a legitimate occupation, such as education, writing, journalism, labor, agriculture, military, politics, law, industry, and commerce, etc., and whose character is upright, scholarship is excellent, who are free from the various vices of smoking, gambling, and prostitution, whose lives are frugal, whose words and actions are consistent, who are mutually helpful and loving, who prioritize the public over the private, who prioritize the country over the family, and who in all matters take the shared existence and prosperity of compatriots as a prerequisite, especially those who are enthusiastic about education, writing, and journalism, and who are determined to build models and lay foundations for the country and the nation, these compatriots are truly the pillars of the country and the teachers of the people and should be given special respect and preferential treatment. Other compatriots who can each do their best and contribute their talents to their occupations, devoting themselves wholeheartedly and striving for progress and development, and who have various inventions and achievements that benefit the country, the nation, and society, are excellent citizens, and all compatriots throughout the country should respect and cherish them. (2) All adult male and female citizens of the Republic of China who have no legitimate occupation, or who have an occupation but engage in the following behaviors, such as having immoral conduct, "smoking, gambling, prostitution, various vices," relying on laziness, being selfish and self-interested, making absurd statements, deceiving and cheating, being cunning and malicious, fabricating rumors and sowing discord, manipulating and exploiting, harming the country and the people, and all kinds of behaviors that violate the common existence of compatriots in order to achieve their personal goals of stealing fame and reputation, obtaining promotions and wealth, enjoying comfort and luxury, and keeping concubines, these people are the vermin of our compatriots and the scum of humanity, especially those who use education, writing, and journalism to seek personal gain, those who use military, political, and legal power to oppress and exploit compatriots, and those unscrupulous merchants and corrupt monks who use commerce to solicit shares and raise capital, engage in embezzlement and corruption, and seek lucky opportunities for speculation, who, when they fail, remain unpunished by the law (the law does not restrain them, and society does not condemn them, so that people dare not invest in various industries), are evil citizens, and all compatriots throughout the country should investigate, monitor, and severely condemn them at any time, urging them to awaken and repent. If they are inherently vicious and stubborn to the point of death, then their crimes and misdeeds should be announced, and the government should be requested to severely punish and execute them. If this cannot be achieved, then compatriots throughout the country should rise up to sanction and abandon them, striving to ensure that these selfish, self-interested, harmful, and misleading evil citizens disappear from the Republic of China in this time of crisis and survival. My compatriots, my beloved compatriots, think about it, think deeply about it. The bankruptcy of our country's education today, the corruption of politics, the arrogance of the military, the snobbery of scholars, the extravagance of the rich, the poverty of laborers and farmers, the failure of unscrupulous merchants to seek excellence and durability in their products, the substitution of domestic goods by counterfeiters using inferior goods, and all kinds of deceitful, fraudulent, immoral, and shameless behaviors in society are all the result of the concept of family and individual selfishness. The Communist Party's terrorist policies, acts of killing and slaughter, we oppose them extremely because they extinguish humanity, but if we do not follow the trend, thoroughly awaken, and abolish our own evil thoughts and behaviors of enjoying abundant food and beautiful clothes, being happy and carefree, and not caring about the life and death of others, and strive to make the deformed and unequal society become increasingly equal, then the collapse is only a matter of time. My beloved scholars, rich people, intelligent and clever people, if you do not quickly catch up, awaken those who are unaware, and work together to change selfishness and self-interest into mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and change self-respect and self-indulgence into shared respect and shared excellence, then our Chinese nation, even without the invasion of the Japanese pirates, will be difficult to escape the disturbances of the communist bandits and will perish. Do you not see that today, the great disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction is already upon us, and yet the party and state gentlemen who bear the responsibility of saving the country and the people are still arguing over conditions, giving the Japanese slaves the opportunity to sow discord and fabricate rumors? The state is the barrier of the nation, and the government is the base camp for the common survival of the people. It is necessary to ensure that politics are enlightened, right and wrong are commonly seen, and society is at peace, so that the work of resisting Japan and saving the country can be thorough. Only then can our Chinese nation have hope of revival.</p>
<p>Floating Life News (Methods for Counter Staff and Workers to Boycott Japanese Goods on Their Own)</p>
<p>Recently read Bingyuan’s News, boycotting inferior goods is the first good method to save the country and no addition. Repeated boycotts have resulted in failure, all because of unscrupulous merchants seeking profit. As Bingyuan said, although there are enthusiastic comrades who are determined not to buy inferior goods, most unscrupulous merchants only know how to seek profit and do not care about national demise. They clearly label inferior goods as domestic goods, so buyers do not realize it. I serve in the cloth industry and firmly believe that this is true. Now, the only solution is for workers in various industries to boycott on their own. For example, counter staff should not sell inferior goods, and workers should not transport inferior goods. But there are two difficulties: (1) As counter staff, they are forced under the power of capitalists, and all actions are not free. (2) Workers are all from poor families and are limited by their livelihoods and have no choice but to compromise in order to make a living. Fortunately, Mingjiao responded in the newspaper,</p>
<p>(Reply) Change selfishness and self-interest into mutual assistance and mutual benefit, change self-respect and self-indulgence into shared respect and shared excellence. Zhang's hope, if it can really be achieved, that would be extremely good. In this time of national crisis, probably all parties have some awareness, but just being aware is not enough; everyone must start from their own selves. So we often say to people, if you feel that something should be done, you must do it yourself first, and if you feel that something should not be done, you must not do it yourself first. Otherwise, Zhang said that even without the invasion of Japan, we will inevitably be disturbed and destroyed by the communist bandits, which is absolutely true. Floating Life's suggestion to boycott the issue and advocate that counter staff and workers boycott on their own is indeed a fundamental solution. Afraid of being oppressed by capitalists and involving livelihood issues, I think capitalists also have a conscience, and everyone loves their country as much as I do. Let us try our best to persuade and guide them.</p>

<p>Three to one... Qiu beats Lin</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai 6|6 6|3 3|2 8|6 Lin Baohua</p>
<p>In the country, when talking about tennis, people admire Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai. It can be said that the skills of these two are unparalleled in the country. Three years ago, Lin once defeated Qiu, and Lin's position surpassed Qiu's. Later, the two went their separate ways, separated north and south. The changes in the skills of each became a topic of conversation after drinking tea and wine in recent years. Until the National Day, after Qiu Feihai defeated Lin Baohua three to one, today's Qiu has undoubtedly leaped ahead of Lin. Although the two are national players, there is no need to keep their wins and losses in mind. I hope they will not abandon themselves, strive for progress, and promote future generations to open up a new world. The future of Chinese tennis is really promising.</p>
<h3 id="e180">ART EACH HAS ITS OWN MERITS 丨 <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Being experienced, steady, and winning can be regarded as a memorable page in Qiu's life's record. At the opening of the war, Qiu was trapped under Lin's racket, and his eyes were full of thorns, and he was unable to recover. Every time he thought of extricating himself, he found it difficult to do so. The balls he hit were often soaked, leading to the failure of the first set. At that time, Qiu's will was calm, and he obviously had the demeanor of a great general. He was experienced and steady in drawing the ball at the corner, which was accurate and powerful. He tried to save the second set easily and took the third set. In the fourth set, which was a matter of life and death, Lin led several times, seeming to be able to take it as his own, but Qiu was always able to fight against it. At that time, if there was any slackness, he would be hit hard. After four intense sets, Qiu was already exhausted. If the game was extended, all his efforts would be wasted. Qiu knew himself and his enemy, so he could win the final victory. After the battle, he fell to the ground, showing that Qiu's victory was not easy. Strategic errors: Lin has two major advantages: 1. He is powerful in serving and especially good at blocking the net. 2. He is young, strong, and tireless in long battles, but he is prone to anger when frustrated, which is his biggest problem. Winning the first set too easily aroused a sense of complacency, and he abandoned his best skills in grabbing the net and insisted on long shots. The strategy was not his strength. He mistakenly lost the second and third sets to others. In the fourth set, Lin's muscles were strong and he looked much better. If he remained calm, he could have won, and the fifth set could have been predicted to go to Lin. But his anger had already spread, and his ability to restrain himself was weak. He failed and destroyed himself. Qiu had his own strengths in winning, and Lin should know the focus of his failure.</p>
<h3 id="e181">丨COMPETITION TO SEE WHO IS BETTER丨 <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Winning one set easily, Lin was full of vigor when he came on the court. Before long, he occupied three games. Qiu won a total of the fourth, sixth, and eighth games in this set, with the sixth game being the most exciting. In short, at that time, Lin had supreme power to command everything.</p>
<p>Score of the first set</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Lin 44546551413</p>
<p>111111111111</p>
<p>Qiu 20364734110</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Losing it easily is not difficult. Lin won easily, but lost it easily too. The reason was that he was complacent and abandoned his strengths and focused on shooting the ball. After 11, Qiu was great, playing with Lin in his hands and winning three games in a row. Lin wanted to cheer up but it was too late. After a long time, Qiu also won the second set 6 to 3.</p>
<h3 id="e182">SCORE OF THE SECOND SET <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>

<p>The river water breaks and rushes thousands of miles. Qiu used Lin's complacency to win the second set in one battle, and then took advantage of the victory to launch a large-scale attack. His powerful corner shots were used properly, and Lin had very few opportunities to get close to the net. Occasionally, Qiu would return a high lob, which would cause him to lose points instead. Lin was angry, and the situation became worse and worse. Qiu won six games, four more than Lin, which shows the general gap between the two sides.</p>

<p>11</p>
<p>The line between life and death Qiu was in high spirits after losing and winning. Lin was afraid of losing and tried to fight back. The situation was very tense and the score was close, which was the best of all the sets. Lin won first, and Qiu equalized. Lin won again, and Qiu added three games, taking the lead with four to two. At that time, Qiu's physical strength was insufficient and he gradually fell behind. Lin tied the score at four to four. In the ninth game, Qiu had already taken a net lead of three, but unexpectedly lost five in a row. It was very unfortunate to lose this game. Lin took the lead with five to four and six to five, holding the advantage. Everyone felt sorry for Lin when he lost the opportunity to win. In the thirteenth game, Qiu won in a row. In the fourteenth game, with the score tied at five to five, he had a cramp and fell to the ground. He got up and fought again, his face was pale and he was very embarrassed. Lin did not take the opportunity to save the game and escape death. Instead, he panicked and lost two games in a row, extinguishing his own lifeline. It was a pity.</p>
<p>SCORE OF THE FOURTH SET</p>
<p>Qiu 6416844434244716</p>

<p>Lin Wangsu 6 to 1, 6 to 3, 6 to 2 Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>Lin Wangsu's victory over Jiang Daozhang was effortless. Jiang Daozhang couldn't withstand Lin's attack. In the first set, Jiang only won the third game. In the last two sets, the situation was slightly eased, but Wangsu's long shots were difficult to deal with. Lin's victory was effortless.</p>
<p>Lin and Qiu are left-handed and right-handed. Lin Wangsu's hitting style is completely the same as Qiu Feihai's. He is accustomed to making long shots from the baseline and fights unyieldingly to the end. The only difference between the two is that Qiu uses his right hand to hold the racket, while Lin uses his left hand. Jiang's performance was more progressive, but he had very few opportunities to get to the net the day before. The reason was that Lin's high balls were too difficult for Jiang to get to the net, so he could only run around the court and eventually suffered a big defeat.</p>

<p>The war generals were already tired. After the singles match, they rested for a while and the doubles match began. Malay and Tianjin continued the unfinished third set. Malay led three to one. They then won three games in a row, winning six to one. So, Malay won Tianjin two to one in total. The original five-set three-win system was changed to a three-set two-win system. The time and energy were exhausted. Lin Baohua was tired after the war, so the doubles match was not exciting. Malay, on the other hand, was on the rise.</p>
<p>Qiu had cramps. Shanghai and Tianjin continued to fight. They had even less interest. Qiu barely appeared on the stage. He relied entirely on Jiang Daozhang to fight. So, Tianjin won the first set 6 to 2. Each team won one game in the second set. In the third game, Qiu Feihai had cramps and fell to the ground. The Shanghai team gave up the game and Tianjin won.</p>

It was indeed due to the trend of rising silver prices and rising exchange rates. Traders tended to sell British and American exchange rates to hedge. It is estimated that British gold has exceeded one shilling and eight pence, and American gold is outside thirty-three yuan. People were extremely terrified, especially because the United States was planning to convene a silver conference, and the Japanese political situation was turbulent. Furthermore, the Japanese pirates in the East Province were invading one after another. The high price at the beginning of this week was seven hundred and twenty-nine taels, and the closing price on the weekend was suddenly six hundred and seventy-eight and a half taels, with a total difference of fifty taels and five cents, a total drop of forty-nine taels. According to the settlement price of the US exchange rate, it was sixty taels to ninety taels, and finally more than eighty taels. Generally, the bulls and bears controlled each other, but there was no certainty, because they were subject to the influence of the air. However, there is still a dramatic change in the future. However, I am afraid that the bulls will rarely win. The following is a summary of the progress of this week:</p>
<p>The daily ups and downs began on Monday (October 5). The big bar silver increased by 4,375, the silver price increased by 125, the shilling increased by two files, and the internal market was also loose. Traders were selling, and the hedge was like the US dollar leaving thirty-two or three taels. The gold market opened at seven hundred and twenty-seven taels, down five and a half taels, then twenty-nine taels. Later, it gradually fell further and further, with a strong selling trend. It was also heard that the United States was planning to use both gold and silver, so it fell sharply by more than ten taels, or twelve taels. The noon closing price was fifteen taels. In the afternoon, it opened at fifteen and a half taels, but it rose to twenty-two taels because of more purchases. The closing price was sixteen taels and six cents, down fifteen taels and nine cents from last Saturday. The front and back markets had a total of seventeen taels of rotation. A large household, Mr. Wu, advanced and retreated. The next day, the big bar increased by another 875, the silver price also increased by 875, the shilling increased by three files, and the internal market rebounded. It was a state of tightness, and traders were paying shillings and selling US dollars. Yesterday, in the gold market, the opening price dropped by eleven taels and six cents to seven hundred and five taels, then to zero four taels and five cents. Later, because the big bar was still in good condition, the United States sold it, and the market turned soft. Furthermore, there was fear that the British and American exchange rates would rebound, so the big bar might fall back. People's hearts were easily moved, so the gold price gradually rose, soaring by more than ten taels to sixteen taels and eight cents. The noon closing price was fourteen taels and one cent. In the afternoon, the market opened at fifteen and a half taels and then showed a good situation, reaching twenty-four taels and two cents. The closing price was twenty-four taels, a rebound of seven taels and four cents. The whole day had a nineteen taels and seven cents rotation. On Wednesday, the big bar shrank from 375 to 4375, and the US silver also decreased by 125. The shilling did not change, and the internal market was flat. Traders in the gold industry were selling, because the US dollar was harder and the shilling seemed soft. As for the mark gold, the opening price was seven hundred and twenty taels, down four taels. Then, it went from nineteen taels to twenty-one taels. Although the big bar shrank, the silver price was not enough. Furthermore, there was talk of the United States saving the silver price issue by reconvening the conference. The big households sold heavily, and the price plunged by more than ten taels, breaking into seven hundred and ten taels, or zero seven taels. The noon closing price rebounded to twelve taels and two cents, and the Indian exchange rate reported small. The opening price in the afternoon was zero nine and a half taels, but the big foreign merchants Qiao Rifu and others came out again, and the price suddenly fell to six hundred and ninety-five and a half taels. Later, it increased to seven hundred and three taels and five cents, but the result was still weak, at six hundred and ninety-six taels. Chen Fengyong came on the stage to sell. The closing price was seven taels and three cents, a miserable drop of twenty-six taels and seven cents from the previous day. The whole day had a review of twenty-five taels and five cents. The Japanese cabinet was shaken, and there was talk of banning gold exports, which caused panic in people's hearts. The next day, the big bar did not change, the silver price increased by 375, the shilling was as before, the US dollar was small, due to the exchange rate relationship, and the internal market increased. However, it was chaotic, and the industry was selling to hedge. The gold market at seven hundred and four taels and five already added seven taels and two cents. Suddenly, it was reported that President Hoover had proposed the silver market again, and the big households sold heavily. The US exchange rate saw a rise, from thirty-two yuan seventy-five to one seven nine three seventy-five, so it dropped to six hundred and ninety-one and a half taels. Later, Hengxing and others bought in, and the listed US dollar shrank by 625, reaching seven hundred and eight taels. The big households came to sell again, and in a moment, it went back up by more than eight taels to six hundred and ninety-nine and a half taels. At noon, it was seven hundred and nine taels and eight cents, and the closing price was zero four taels. After zero three taels in the afternoon, it was zero seven taels. Wu and others withdrew and sold small three or four taels, and Zhifengyong Yuancheng Yong and others came out again, reaching seven hundred and one taels. The closing price was zero three taels and eight cents, a rebound of six taels and five cents from the previous day. There was an eighteen taels and three cents rotation all day. Wu advanced and then retreated. On Friday, the big bar increased from 4,375 to half a penny, the silver price increased by 25, the shilling also increased by one file, the internal market also loosened, and the industry sold 2 million US dollars and 100,000 pounds of British gold. The mark gold opened and broke into seven hundred taels, calculated at six hundred and ninety-seven taels. Then, from ninety-three taels to seven hundred and one taels and three cents, the buying momentum was booming, and it re-entered seven hundred taels. The noon closing price was six hundred and eighty-nine taels, eighty-eight taels and five in the afternoon, then ninety-one taels and four cents. The Japanese cabinet turmoil was particularly fierce, and it was heard that the situation in Jinzhou was even tighter, and the exchange rate was also loose, so the price suddenly fell to six hundred and seventy-eight taels and five. Afterwards, it was eighty-six taels, and then eighty taels and zero five. People's hearts were floating, and there was no way to deal with it. The closing price was eighty-three taels and five, a miserable drop of twenty taels and three cents from the previous day. There were twenty-two taels and eight cents of twists and turns that day. The big households Wu and Chen were selling heavily. Because it was National Day on Saturday, the market was closed. However, the big bar silver slightly increased by 0.625, calculated at seventeen pence and three seventy-five, and the forward also increased by 0.625, calculated at seventeen pence five, six two five. The US silver price increased by 375, calculated at two corners and nine cents and seventy-five, and the exchange rates all rose. The market was flat. The following is a detailed description of the high and low prices of British, American, Indian, and silver markets, as well as exchange rates and mark gold:</p>

<h3 id="e189">Securities: Last Week's Bond Price Fluctuations Remain Severe <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Compared to the Previous Week, the Decline Was Even Greater</p>
<p>Only 1929 Customs Bonds Were Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Last week (from October 5th to 10th), the bond market conditions in this city's securities market were as usual, except for Saturday's National Day holiday. Spot transactions were scarce. Although many types were available, the total turnover was only 26,000 yuan. The futures market was also quite quiet. The November futures contracts started trading on Thursday. The total turnover for the week was 53.255 million yuan, an increase of about 23 million yuan compared to the previous week. As for the fluctuations, they were still very severe. On Monday, due to the lack of improvement in the diplomatic situation, the market was weak and prices fell steadily. Except for the 1936 bonds, and the 1929 customs bonds, which fell by four yuan and trading was suspended, all other bonds fell by two, three, or three yuan. On Tuesday, the situation was dull, and there was news of a peaceful resolution with Guangdong, which improved market sentiment slightly. Short positions were covered, and the supply and demand situation was somewhat balanced. Prices fluctuated without a major decline. On Wednesday, the situation became tense again, with active selling transactions from all sides. Bond prices fell across the board. The Disbandment 1929 Customs Bonds were suspended from trading again due to excessive decline. Other bonds also fell by small amounts, such as three or four yuan. The 1936 bonds also fell by six jiao. On Thursday, the market situation suddenly changed. Although there was no significant improvement in the diplomatic situation, due to the substantial decline in recent days, and the financial industry's joint discussions on maintaining stability, the market became more active for a time. Many short positions were covered, and retail investors actively invested. The morning market gradually strengthened. Investor sentiment was even better in the afternoon, with prices soaring and trading being suspended due to demand exceeding supply. Only a few types of bonds, such as the Customs Tariff Reorganization 1936 bonds, were not suspended from trading. However, this sudden surge was purely due to temporary investor enthusiasm. Therefore, on Friday, buyers became hesitant, and bond prices fell sharply. For example, the 1920 Customs Bonds and the Consolidated Tax 1929 Bonds fell to the limit price in the early morning and trading was suspended. The Disbandment 1929 Customs Bonds and the Salt Tax Bonds were also suspended from trading in the afternoon. By the time the market closed, the trend had started to ease, and the after-hours trading of bonds showed slight increases after the declines. As a result, compared to the previous week, the Disbandment Bonds fell by more than ten yuan, the 1920 Customs Bonds also fell by more than eight yuan, and the Reorganization, Consolidated Tax, and Salt Tax Bonds also fell by more than six yuan. Only the 1929 Customs Bonds fell slightly by seven or eight jiao. The spot prices of the whole 1936, the disbandment, the 1920 roll tax, and other items have not been compared for a long time, and the spot prices have fallen by more than ten yuan compared with last month. The bond market may be temporarily stable. If the diplomatic situation does not deteriorate further, it is hoped that it will gradually strengthen. The following table lists the high and low prices and fluctuations of various bonds last week (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>In Shanghai South, there were about 50 boats from the west road source in the past two days. The early rice of the kiln type was lacking, and nearly a thousand stones of cargo from the middle pass of the river were brought in. The entire amount was sold out that day, and the price also increased by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Due to the relationship between the cost of letters from the mainland, the supply will definitely be short. The new japonica rice and the new reed tip rice were scarce, and the price was also tightly pulled. The influence of the new goods on the rice husking is difficult to increase the market. The price of white rice with pointed leaves is still the same, and the market is changing in a negative direction. The wine merchants are very light, and the downstream is also very low.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday's market trend was rising. The River bottom was more lively than the previous market. The top-quality Changxi new japonica rice and the middle-quality white japonica rice were each offered at a price increase of 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The new Baige rice also increased by 0.1 yuan. Although there was early and late rice on the stack, the number was not large. The opening price was fixed. The sales of new yang Du tip rice and white rice with pointed leaves are slowing down. The overall market is stable, and the transaction of foreign rice in this city is limited. The price of transshipment gangs is rising slightly. Glutinous rice has arrived and is being sold slowly, and the situation has declined by nearly one jiao. There were about 70 boats in total.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Sugar Market: Tate &amp; Lyle Sugar is Scarce and in Demand <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, due to the fact that it was a Sunday and there was no telegram from the production area, the association market was divided. The price of Dutch coarse sand white was still set at 11 taels per piece. The price of newly arrived goods that could not be shipped was 11 taels, 3 qian and 5 fen. Cotton Dutch white was 12 taels and 5 fen, medium sand white was 10 taels and 9 qian, and high goods were 11 taels. Transactions were scattered, and the market was stable. Tate &amp; Lyle sugar was in greater demand, and the market stock was not large. Although there will be continued arrivals, the amount will not be large. Therefore, the market is more brisk, and the upper end is even more so. B-mark was 12 taels, 3 qian to 2.5 fen, and there was a shortage of goods. HX mark was 12 taels and 1 qian, HM mark was 11 taels and 7.5 qian, KY mark was 11 taels and 2 qian, and H mark was 11 taels and 9 qian. The market was stable and brisk.</p>

<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, for the past twenty days, the work of boycotting Japanese goods has indeed been very enthusiastic. There have been speeches, purchases, meetings, inspections, and the posting of slogans, all of which have been widespread throughout Shanghai. As a result, whether it is men and women in red or green, or old and young, everyone knows that Japanese goods should be boycotted, and everyone is unwilling to buy Japanese goods anymore. However, China is a vast country with abundant resources. Doing this kind of propaganda work in the metropolis is not enough. Everyone should devote some energy to going to the interior and the countryside to vigorously promote the boycott. Because transportation is less convenient in the interior and the countryside, and the people are less enlightened, they may not even know much about the invasion of the three northeastern provinces by the violent Japanese. And they are still buying and selling Japanese goods. Therefore, we must quickly go there to promote the boycott. Comrades, go to the interior, go to the countryside.</p>
<p>Random Notes from the Grass-Removing Studio</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Pole on the Barber's Load <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>When the Qing troops entered the customs, the people of the Ming Dynasty loved their hair more than their country. When the country was lost, their hair was inevitably shaved off. Two hundred and eighty-six years ago, Dodo went south of the Yangtze River. In April, he broke Yangzhou, and in May, Nanjing fell. He issued an order to shave hair, calling the barbers to walk on the streets with their loads. When they met people with long hair, they would catch them and shave them forcibly. If anyone resisted, they would cut off their heads and hang them on the pole of the load to show the public. Why did the barber's load have a pole later? This pole was originally prepared to hang people's heads. At that time, the Tartars and traitors also had words similar to modern slogans on the announcements. The two most cruel sentences were "Keep your head, but not your hair; keep your hair, but not your head." Those old people who loved their hair more than their country now love their hair more than their heads. Tens of thousands of people rose up everywhere to protect their hair and resist the Qing. Although these old people were somewhat confused about the importance of things in the past, they were relatively more ambitious than those who shaved immediately when they saw the knife and offered no resistance. It's a pity that they had no training and no good weapons on weekdays, so they were annihilated one after another in less than ten and a half months. If they had used the power to protect their hair to protect their country earlier, why would their descendants have been enslaved for 268 years? If we don't want to repeat their mistakes, we must (1) love the country more than our own family; (2) unite as soon as possible, learn real martial arts, and desperately resist foreign insults. Now most of the people across the country have understood this great truth, and they will surely rise up together to save the country. But there are still many muddleheaded people who live in a drunken dream. Well, if you want to know what it's like to lose your country, just think of the pole on the barber's load.</p>
<h3 id="e195">A Page from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Imprisonment in London <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>After the failure of the first revolution in Guangzhou in 1895, Sun Yat-sen took refuge in Yokohama. Soon after, he traveled to Honolulu, and then went to the United States to promote the revolution. He was warmly welcomed by the overseas Chinese. Gradually, the Qing Legation in the United States detected him, and his actions became inconvenient. Therefore, he decided to go to London, the capital of England.</p>
<p>After arriving in London, he changed his name to Chen Wen, courtesy name Zai Zhi, and lived in the Krelitz Hotel. He learned that his teachers, Drs. Cantlie and Manson, had returned to England long ago. He scheduled a meeting with them, and the teachers and students were very happy. Cantlie's residence was very close to the Chinese Legation. He passed by the Legation almost every day on his way to Cantlie's residence. As a result, he met Deng Tingkeng, an interpreter at the Legation, on the way and had a conversation with him. After a while, Sun took out a gold watch to check the time. Deng asked to see it. The English phonetic spelling of the surname Sun was engraved on it. Deng suddenly realized and silently reported to Gong Xinzhan (Gong was the nephew of Minister Gong Zhaoyuan) to report to the Minister. Then he conspired with the British consultant, Macartney, to lure Mr. Sun into the three-story building of the Legation. He ordered Chinese and Western servants to guard him strictly in preparation for</p>
<p>Guangzhou, in order to claim credit and receive awards. The time was October 11th. Mr. Sun was trapped for six days. He repeatedly tried to get the English servants in the Legation to pass letters to Drs. Cantlie and Manson for help. They were all searched. The guards became even stricter. Mr. Sun was helpless and took prayer to God as a way to comfort himself. (Sun wrote to Elder Qu Fenghui of Hong Kong, describing the prayer in detail. In recent years, Christians have often used this letter to prove that Sun was a devout Christian.)</p>
<p>Alas, a mirror cannot be clear if it is not polished, and iron cannot be refined if it is not smelted. Heaven never cuts off all hope for people, especially for the savior of the Chinese nation. One day, Mr. Sun was chatting with an English servant, and the conversation involved Christianity. In a desperate situation, a plan was born. He asked about the Turkish emperor's massacre of Armenian Christians. Cole nodded. Sun then claimed to be a Christian believer who was hated by the Chinese Manchu emperor, who was jealous of the church. He had long wanted to capture and kill him, just like the Turkish emperor treated the Armenians. Now he was imprisoned in the Legation and would be sent back to the country within days and subjected to extreme punishment. Because the British government has always attached importance to humanity and protected believers, they acted secretly. If they could speak out righteously, not only would they be blessed by the Lord, but it would be a blessing for China and an honor for Britain. The words were earnest and sincere, and Mr. Cole was moved. Then he threw the secret letter into the coal basket and sent it to Drs. Cantlie and Manson.</p>
<p>Cantlie and others were shocked when they received the letter. They visited the superintendent of the Scotland Yard and officials from the Foreign Office, and sent a letter to the Earth newspaper to publish the whole story. The police station did not believe it at first. They hired a private detective to secretly investigate the actions of the Legation. As a result, British Prime Minister Salisbury had a major negotiation with the Chinese Legation. The citizens of London were particularly agitated. Minister Gong Zhaoyuan knew that the public's anger was difficult to offend, so he restored Mr. Sun's freedom on October 23rd. He was imprisoned for twelve days. When he left the Legation, there were crowds of people, all wanting to see the demeanor of the leader of the Chinese Revolutionary Party. Various newspapers competed to record the event. After escaping from danger, Mr. Sun traveled to Germany, France, Belgium and other countries to study politics for several months before returning to Japan. He also wrote a book called "Kidnapped in London" to be published.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that Gong Xinzhan was the one who planned Mr. Sun's imprisonment in the British Legation. When Mr. Sun died in Beiping in 1925, Gong was the Minister of the Interior and represented Duan Qirui in the Hall of the Altar of Land and Grain in the park. He bowed three times to the corpse of Mr. Sun. Gong was wondering what he felt when he recalled the past.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Northwest National Defense and Yang Hucheng <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>The border provinces of our country are vast and sparsely populated, and the treasures are extremely rich. They have long been coveted by powerful neighbors. Since the Northeast Incident, the neglect of national defense has been fully exposed. Although the people of the country can cooperate and work together to plan the recovery of lost land, the essence has been destroyed. The recovery of vitality, but I do not know how much time it will take. It is particularly painful to say. Only the past is over. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. Since the Northeast has suffered a great robbery, the Northwest border area should be properly planned for a solid national defense as soon as possible. It is hoped that Red Russia will learn from the Japanese's old tricks of plotting the Northeast and destroy our fence. This is really the most important plan of today. The treasures covered in the northwest provinces are as rich as those in the northeast. It is only because of the obstruction of transportation that they have not been developed. This is due to the fact that the past officials in the northwest failed to do it on the ground. After Yang Hucheng took charge of the government in Shaanxi Province, all industries were thriving. Not only was the banditry eliminated, but the annual income was also extremely abundant. Compared with the desolate and chaotic situation when Feng Yuxiang's troops were stationed in Shaanxi a year ago, the difference cannot be measured by reason. Since Yang also served as the director of the Tongguan Camp, he regarded the consolidation of national defense and the development of the northwest as his responsibilities, and urged them to be realized as soon as possible. Yang has served in the northwest for decades, and he is highly respected. The governors of Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces have all expressed extreme obedience. The central government has also deeply trusted him, and he will be able to lead the group to achieve this goal. Even in the past, the people who changed in Gansu could wait for Yang to deal with it. It can be seen that Yang is one of the most popular people. The reporter deeply hopes that the people of the country will quickly shift their attention to the northwest and provide more assistance to the various industries in the northwest. Assisting Yang to complete this task is really the gospel of our country. If we are still indifferent and do not seek self-help, then the lessons of the Northeast are not far away, and national affairs will be even more unbearable.</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Current Situation of Qingyang, Suzhou <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>The Japanese are invading our country. The Treaty of Shimonoseki, which was lost to the Japanese, required the opening of concessions and commercial ports, which were mostly inland areas. For example, the opening of commercial ports in Jinan and the concessions in Suzhou can be seen here. If there is any negotiation, the treaty of the concession can be used to directly enter the inland. The Suzhou Japanese Concession is outside Panmen, in a place called Qingyangdi. When the Japanese leased the land, it also caused a sensation among the people of Suzhou. Before the late Qing Dynasty banned opium, Qingyangdi was within the sphere of influence of the Japanese. In accordance with the purpose of harming me with poison, opium dens were established everywhere and could be seen everywhere. The city signs of Qing paste and Guangshi were full of hope. In addition to opium dens, gambling dens were mixed in. Suzhou people have always been comfortable, and their lives are very prosperous. It has suddenly become a prosperous area. Speculators have set up theaters and restaurants. For a time, tourists regarded Qingyangdi as the destination. This was the heyday. Later, when the Huning Road was built, the Japanese once disputed, wanting to set up the station outside Panmen in Qingyang.</p>

<p>— Hu Yanhong</p>
<p>Dear Mother:</p>
<p>I reluctantly suppressed my supreme sorrow and deepest enthusiasm and wrote you this letter of farewell. Now, nothing can stop my determination to join the army, I am willing to think of nothing, I only want to serve the country, and I am willing to die on the battlefield and be a loyal ghost of China. I can't take care of you, dear mother!</p>
<p>Don't be sad, don't be timid, you should be proud, because it is your dear son who is willing to be a martyr for the country, I have seen many mothers in other countries who also love their sons, but when the country is in trouble, they forget their private feelings and encourage each of their sons to go to work for their motherland, I hope you, dear mother, will be the first mother in China who loves her country more than her son. To be honest, it is sad to have a young man die on a cruel battlefield with bullets and bullets; however, if China is unfortunately destroyed, it is thousands of times more sad than dying in battle to have countless young people suffer bullying and abuse from foreigners, then you will not be able to love your son, watching your own flesh and blood writhing and moaning under the iron hooves of others.</p>
<p>Dear mother, be brave, wipe away the tears of love. With a solemn face, I warned your son: "Go ahead, son! I raised you for the country. If the country is in trouble, if you are not brave enough to go forward, you will fail me and insult me!</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Dear mother, how I wish all mothers in China now would say this to their sons: "Goodbye, give my love to you, and I don't want to come back alive to see you!"</p>
<p>Next to it, so that the city will not decline. However, at that time, the people of Suzhou, in view of the advantages and disadvantages, fought hard to set it up outside Loumen. Due to traffic relations, Jinzhang emerged at the right time, and Qingyangdi gradually declined. The ban on gambling and opium was frequently issued. Opium dens and gambling dens gradually closed down. Theaters also moved to Jinzhang. The city of Qingyangdi fell sharply. The prosperity of the past is not what it used to be. Only a few secret opium dens are left. However, those who arrived thought that the place was desolate, and the Japanese had not invested in it. It was far less prosperous than Jinzhang. They were unwilling to go there. Until today, only uneven roads and empty, uninhabited wastelands can be seen. The Japanese consulate stands alone. From this, it can be seen that the cunning of the Japanese is not as good as that of the European and American countries, which can invest heavily to revitalize the market. The Japanese only have deceptive tricks to make the people of Suzhou foolish and think that they can be sheltered under them. They do not hesitate to spend huge sums of money to revitalize it. Once the adultery is exposed, like the collapse of an iceberg, it will become the Qingyangdi of today. Recently, the violent Japanese invaded and plundered our northeast. The Japanese living in Qingyangdi were disturbed by themselves and held residents' meetings one after another. First, the Japanese Consul went to the Public Security Bureau to discuss with Director Zou Jing the method of protecting overseas Chinese. They intended to take advantage of this period to ask soldiers to invade our inland. However, Zou replied that he could take full responsibility and ordered the police in the district to work hard to protect them. The people of Suzhou were also very peaceful and knew the cunning of the Japanese. They did not argue with them and advised each other not to enter Qingyangdi again. Even a rickshaw driver would not stay in Qingyangdi. The residents also moved away one after another. Therefore, the Qingyangdi area has been like a ghost domain for several days and is deserted.</p>
<h3 id="e199">An Art Exhibition Demonstrating National Spirit <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Qiang</p>
<p>When the famous painter Wang Jiyuan traveled in Europe, he witnessed the propaganda of the Japanese Art Association internationally. He had long had the ambition to dominate East Asia. He made Europeans and Americans know only Japan when it came to modern oriental culture, but not China. It was the most infuriating thing. He once held a solo exhibition in Paris, raising the status of the international art world. This time, after Mr. Wang returned to China, he contributed his firm will when the country was in trouble and held a European art exhibition in Shanghai, which is concerned by all countries, to show that the new Chinese national spirit is immortal. Since it was displayed in the Mingfu Library on October 1, Europeans, Americans, and Japanese have paid attention to it. No less than dozens of people have come to visit the meeting. Many young students in our country have come here. It is commendable to work hard to study academics in the midst of anti-Japanese voices. The most brilliant works of Mr. Wang are "Struggle" and "The God of Victory". The calmness of the color and the magnificence of the brushstrokes are still secondary. The performance of national spirit and the unique style of the East is thorough. Reading it can be encouraging. It is said that there will be an exhibition in the central location of the concession in a few days. (Move the reward to help the disaster)</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>According to the common practice in the imperial examination arena, any new scholars of the current session who have not yet obtained the qualifications for the imperial examination must be examined and recommended as undiscovered talents by the academy yamen before they are allowed to enter the arena to observe. At this time, the Supervising Education Commissioner had strict restrictions on newly advanced young people. Tao Chi was late for the examination three times and was not recorded into the register. Without this examination and selection, even if one possessed aspirations that were second to none and was rich in articles of high-mindedness and spirit, there would be no way to enter this provincial examination hall, which sought talent for the country. To reject him outside the arena, wouldn't it delay his three years of striving? He had undergone the baptism of the imperial examination. Not entering the provincial examination hall was more painful than being sentenced to death. He had no choice but to desperately cry out and run around.</p>
<p>He had run to all the important government offices in the provincial capital! He had cried out to all of them! He held his petition in vain, requesting the official authorities to transfer him into the arena. However, he was eventually shouted back by the gatekeeper's family member, whose belly was seen before their feet even left the door!</p>
<p>Tao Chi, whose fever for fame had reached the boiling point, still stood foolishly by the roadside, holding his petition. Whenever he encountered officials passing by with attendants, regardless of whether they were civil officials, military officials, river management officials, or salt affairs officials, he would always block the sedan chair and shout, delivering the petition requesting to be recommended into the arena. As a result, he was always rejected with the reply that "this official is not in charge of recording undiscovered talents," and the original petition was thrown back! The sedan chair carriers would then shout and leave.</p>
<p>Tao Chi, whose fever for fame had reached the boiling point, was almost going mad! Suddenly, he heard the sound of gongs and drums, mixed with shouts prohibiting pedestrians. The ceremonial guard was extremely grand! After the banners passed, there was a large sedan chair with green felt curtains on all sides. He knew that the examination hall was about to be sealed. He had to launch a final struggle, desperately blocking the sedan chair and shouting for help!</p>
<p>Inside the sedan chair with embroidered curtains, sat not a high-ranking official, but the family member of an official - the unmarried daughter of the Shandong Provincial Military Commander Tang. The accompanying military officers drew their swords, trying to frighten this reckless youth. However, Tao Chi, having resolved to be a wronged ghost under the sword rather than an examinee outside the arena, was not deterred by the drawn swords. He simply leaned on the ground and shouted for help.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Movie Sketch by Lu Mengshu <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>''Seed''</p>
<p>"Seed" is adapted from a novel. I haven't read the novel, but according to Miss Gladys Lehman, the screenwriter, in the "Press Sheet," the play and the original text differ quite a bit. However, the movie is definitely worth watching, as everyone must admit. I saw it a few months ago and was very satisfied.</p>
<p>The plot doesn't have bizarre twists and turns, or magnificent splendor. But the storytelling is subtle, meaningful, elegant and refreshing. That alone is enough for you to have a "daydream".</p>
<p>I very much agree with my friend Mu Luocha's statement that "in one or two years, ordinary facts are presented through artistic means." "Seed" is an artistic work that takes an ordinary story and expresses it through artistic means.</p>
<p>There are no peculiar plots, no grand sets, and no magnificent performances, but it is powerful enough to strike people's hearts.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we watched "Sunrise" and praised it endlessly. But "Sunrise" didn't have any peculiar plots, grand sets, or magnificent performances. It just told an ordinary story about ordinary life. What's so special about a banal story of a couple of adulterers? But when expressed through artistic means, you praise it endlessly. "Seed" is like that. Ten years of yearning, abandoning one's wife and children, is just a segment of an ordinary story in ordinary life. But when expressed through artistic means, it gives you great satisfaction. Only true art can give people a wonderful "fantasy" in film. Those incomplete, superficially magnificent things only make people feel like they are chewing wax.</p>
<p>"Seed" is a manifestation of true art. Its plot is very poignant, very elegant, and very handsome. Its story is very subtle, very fresh, and very graceful. The whole play gives people the feeling of listening to Cantonese folk songs, or listening to a violin solo in the city, or listening to the pipa of a merchant woman on the river under the moon. And yet</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>It is warm and touching, poignant and appropriate, and yet it makes people unable to forget the characters in the play.</p>
<p>My friend Mu Luocha recently wrote a short story called "The Ditch," published in the fifth issue of "The Vanguard Monthly." That "Ditch" writes about the daily lives of men and women. The word "ditch," when pronounced by Cantonese people, has a very subtle interpretation in terms of pronunciation. I don't know if my friend was writing about the daily lives of men and women for the sake of this subtle interpretation when he took this word as the title, because we haven't seen each other in a long time. But "Seed" is completely about the "ditch." In fact, our desperate struggles under near civilization are indeed for the sake of the "ditch." If you know the "ditch," then you know the greatness of "Seed."</p>
<p>The theme of "Seed" is women resisting women, for the sake of "love." However, love, to put it bluntly, is just a "mask" for the "ditch." If you claim to have been baptized in the artistic culture of the city, you should admit what I'm saying.</p>
<p>In terms of the title, the focus is completely on "children." Indeed, the characters in the play already have five children. His wife resists women, on the surface, for the sake of those five children. However, in reality, it is for the sake of the "ditch."</p>
<p>Ah, the daily lives of men and women!</p>
<p>Precisely because it is the daily lives of men and women, it stirs up many sparkling waves and blows out many beautiful bubbles in the vast sea of people in everyday life. Just like "Seed" is a particularly sparkling wave in these many sparkling waves, a particularly beautiful shadow in these many beautiful bubbles. If you take it to symbolize scenery, it is like a burst of water flowers on a mirror-like blue wave under the afterglow of the setting sun. If you say it is a fantasy, then perhaps you had a particularly warm "daydream" in a love triangle in the film.</p>
<p>The original work of "Seed" is a very popular novel in the United States, with sales of hundreds of thousands and has been reprinted several times. The author, Charles G. Norris, has become known as a modern writer in the United States because of the popularity of this novel. As for the film, it is produced by Universal Company and has been translated into Chinese and called "The Faithless Man."</p>
