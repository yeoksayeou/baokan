<h3 id="c22">所謂中村事件（一） <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>近兩三月。眞可謂中日國交多事之秋。萬案韓案連續而起。尙擱懸未决。今又突有所謂中村上尉事件發生。查所謂中村上尉事件。據日本政府發表消息。略謂。（陳軍步兵上尉中村麗太郎。及前騎兵伍長井杉延太郎奉參謀本部命。偕昻昻溪昻榮旅館主伊木延太郎等一行共五人。携帶中國護照。於六月上旬經由哈爾濱出發。往興安嶺視察。原擬兩月即返。但出發而後。查無消息。當由哈爾濱特别機關派員調查。據報告中村一行於六月二十七日左右抵洮索鐵路終點葛根廟附近之民安鎭。正在該處飯館進膳之際。突有興安屯墾隊第三團所屬官兵數人進館檢。命中村一行停止旅行。示以護照。亦無効。被拘捕。槍六挺。及隨身衣物都被掠去。不經提示任何理由。竟將中村一行綁赴該兵營後之山林中槍斃。七月一日復堆積木材焚燬屍體。而此種消息則又得之於朋分中村等遺欵之一中國軍人云。）（八月十八日日本東京大阪各地披露日政府所發表中村事件）至其所提出之證據。則謂有親見中村被殺者多人。但不能發表其姓名。另尙有中村之金錶及其他物品。聞爲屯墾軍第三團長韓玉剛所取去。但據我方調查。則中村等一行之旅行及其被害。迄無確切證據。自此案經日官方宣傳後。日人朝野上下。即如瘋如狂。情勢極爲嚴重。而其主張强硬。則更朝野一致。一若立將有所實施其所謂應急手段者。綜觀最近日方電訊所傳各方意見。吾人即可以想見嚴重情形之一斑。</p>
<p>吾人認爲此案之發生。决不如事實本體之簡單。實另有其嚴重之背景在。取萬案韓案合綜而觀。取日方朝野目前之主張而觀。此嚴重之背景。即顯有線索可尋。吾人茲且就本案之事實加以辯駁。再進論本案所以突然發生之眞因。</p>
<p>（一）據日政府宣稱。中村確領有護照。但護照上註明之人名。職業及目的。則大有疑。問。又據我方鍾毓談。（本報九日哈爾濱專電）則謂五月間哈埠日領館曾送一名中村業商來東三省遊歷之護照。來請簽字。失蹤之中村。或即此人。於此更可證明中村之護照必爲其一種手叚。僞造姓名職業冒領。且護照上註明爲其他職業。而中村實爲現役之陸軍上尉。并携帶槍六枝之多。其是否有軼出護照上明定範圍之行動。釀成意外之變故。其誰能必。就令中村果眞失蹤。我國亦不負何種責任。</p>
<p>（二）興安區地方不靖。蒙匪出入無常民十八我國已照會日本。禁外人前往游歷。原具在。茲中村不顧我國照會。膺負特種使命。故意冒險深入。發生變故。實由自取。我國更可以不負任何責任。</p>
<p>（三）就令中村一行。果眞被害。但所舉人證物證。實亦不能作爲被我官兵戕害之有力證據。旣云有人報告矣。何以不宣佈其姓名。兵士數人朋分遺物。金錶及其他物品何以落於高級軍官韓玉剛之手。旣在韓手。見之者又爲何人。恍惚迷離。大可推敲。吾人謂爲毫無根據也可。謂爲賄買愚民虚構事實以圖遂其大欲。亦無不可。國際間秘密行爲。無所不有。吾人不能不有此設想。更不能不爲之預防。</p>
<p>（四）就令中村一行果眞爲我官兵所戕害。但此次日人挑動韓人排華。我僑胞慘死無數。案懸至今。迄未解决。今日方死中村等三數人。即肆其狂論。高唱採取最後手段。於人何嚴。於己何寛。天下固尙有所謂公理正義耶。日方如欲從速解决中村事件。則萬案與鮮案。不更應儘先解决耶。</p>

<p>八月二十六日晨、裏運東隄、先後潰决、逹二十七處之多、裏下河八縣之地、悉成澤國、災情之慘、較之同治五年清水潭之决口、殆猶過之、内政部以主管全國水災之防禦、特派科長陳湛恩·導淮會以運病由于淮洪之未導、特派代理總工程師須愷、中國水利工程學會研究潰决實况、備向政府建議善後辦法、推副會長李書田、董事孫輔世、偕同實地勘查、遍歷决口各處、自九月一日起至三日晚止、計凡三日、昨導淮會已將勘查實况及會擬之善後辦法、發表如下、</p>
<p>▲運堤潰决之主因據親歷各處决口視察所見、及向當地人民訪查之結果、綜核運堤潰决之主因、計有下列三端、（甲）本年淮運各處水位之高、爲數十年來所未有、而導淮入江入海之路、尙未整理開闢、淮洪停蓄于高寳邵伯諸湖、致運河御馬頭水誌在一丈九尺以上者、計至决口日止、逹半月之久、（乙）裏運西堤年久失修、殘缺不堪、歸海三壩、雖經開放、水猶繼漲、裏運西堤完全滅頂、河湖一片、高寳邵伯等湖之水、直衝東隄、加以河形驟灣驟曲、頂溜冲刷、其勢更猛、（丙）八月二十五日晚西北風大作、颶風中心、據徐家匯天文台所刋報告、密近裏運、以致怒浪雄濤高可盈丈、一夕之間、運隄南北三百里、同時告警潰决、漫溢逹二十七處之多</p>

<p>溧陽東壩、爲太湖流域之命門、一旦潰决、則建瓵直瀉、江南各縣即有陸沉之禍、近以霪雨成災、運堤崩潰、高邵一帶皆有其魚之嘆、江南各縣民衆、咸以東壩安危、關係至鉅、而錫常一帶、尤盛傳東壩有潰决之虞、謡諑繁興、人心浮動、岌岌不可終日、溧陽縣政府特於七日會同建設局、曁地方人士、携帶測量儀器、馳赴東壩、作最近之測勘、茲將測勘情形記之如下、倘亦關心東壩安危者所樂睹也、</p>
<p>▲東壩位置及現狀東壩在溧陽縣治之西、約七十里、屬高淳縣境、昔本長江流經之地、後以太湖流域迭遭災祲、遂築壩以絕江流、共分上下兩壩、相距十里、東壩其總稱也、史局長等於七日晨六時出發、由南渡汶河溯流而西、兩岸圩堤沉决無遺、災黎裸立、慘痛萬狀、途經三塔昇平諸蕩、昔本江流寛弛之處、後壩成流絕、蕩亦淤淺、居民競種稻麥、漸成農田、祗、</p>
<p>留一淺河漕、不絕如縷、今則汪洋萬頃、波濤洶湧、竊自默念、若能將該蕩濬深以蓄水、亦太湖流域萬世之利也、經皖之定埠至下壩、已下午二時、沿壩居民熙熙攘攘、絕無驚惶之態、乃將壩身察勘一週、鞏固如常、立即沿中河步行至上壩、中河長十里、兩岸田疇、地勢頗高、早秈已熟、極目四顧、嘉禾無垠、兩岸居民方慶大有也、三時半抵上壩、繁榮更勝下壩、斯時壩西之水、已與壩頂齊高、前曾一度漫壩而過、亦無重大關係、乃察勘壩身、甚爲完固、惟少數居民築屋壩頂、墻基椿木、使石塊　裂、至爲危險、即將水準儀測上下兩壩相差水位而返、</p>
<p>▲測量結果上壩水位、相差二·七公尺、下壩水位、相差六·八公尺、合計相差九·五八尺、約合三丈左右、可見水勢相差之懸殊、若果潰决、則江南之禍、必甚於江北、下壩劉公橋、已有中河之水流入、現築一小土壩以阻之、</p>
<p>▲現狀觀察照現在形勢、東壩絕對無恙、惟有數點應注意者（甲）禁止壩頂蓋屋、已築者一律拆除、以免人工毁傷之患、（乙）下游各縣、如蘇常錫宜溧陽應聨合派一專員駐守、蓋高淳自東壩築成、田沉十餘萬畝、時欲聚衆開掘、近日謡諑又興、謂定期有特殊舉動、雖屬無稽、亦宜爲綢繆之計、以爲萬一之防、（丙）下游各縣聨合籌措歲修基金、（按東壩本有歲修基金、幾經軍事、欵已挪移無着）事關太湖流域全部利害、應聨合籌募、規定保管辦法、作歲修之費、定一勞永逸之大計、</p>

<p>南京十一日電此間各報早有全運會改期專辦振災紀載、惟該會籌備處一再更正今日中央日報社論、全運會展期問題、結論謂事有大小輕重、時有先後緩急、今被災區逹十六省、被難民逹五千萬、持此與全運會較輕重大小若何、先後緩急若何等語、該報代表中央者、因知全運會展期之說、暫佔有力、</p>
<p>南京十日中央電全運會展期事、已經籌委會通電否認、頃據某中委談、水災嚴重、國府已明令停止一切非急要之建築、集中財力以應慘災、</p>
<p>全運會及其建築、當不若千萬災民生死問題之急迫、擬向中央提請展期舉行、並停止一切建築移欵振災、深望體育界爲災民設想、勿堅持不展期之主張云、</p>

<p>小輪冲毁圩堤</p>
<p>永安輪船被扣</p>
<p>責罰鉅欵修塘</p>
<p>内河小輪、在上月下旬、水勢稍退、各路先後復班、嗣邵郵發生大水災、蘇錫常崑各路小輪、又調赴江北、載運難民、復再輟業、上海方面、申杭申蘇申湖各線、仍可照常行駛矣、詎本月五日起、又復大雨、連綿三日夜、江浙内地各處、已退之水、又見暗漲、開班之小火輪、復以水漲而遭禁航、上海申湖線内永順輪局更因違令航輪、冲欵一百二十萬元、充作修塘之大科罰巨欵一百二十萬元、充作修塘之大禍、今此事尙未解决、昨經記者向各方面切實查明情形、分記如下、</p>
<p>▲湖州水漲禁航上海湖州班輪、共有六艘、在上月下旬復業、仍分早晚兩班、至本月五號起、大雨不止、連下三天、湖州方面、河水大漲、頓增一尺數寸、湖州本有大圩三只、内有田數萬畝、鄕民恐圩塘堤岸、爲水冲毁、乃阻至小輪行駛、而縣公署亦出示禁止小火輪開班、藉此保衛各圩塘、以免發生坍塌、冲没農田、農民協會且派員巡護、申湖各輪、在五日以後、均相率停班、</p>
<p>▲永安輪船損堤、一名永新、一名永安、馬力甚巨、速率較快、當縣公署頒發禁航通告時、該局未曾得知、故永安輪仍由上海開出、其時水已漲大、船到湖州、浪激力大、不免將圩塘堤岸、稍有損毁泥土冲鬆、河水即漏入農田、且有一段爲水冲毁、而激生事故、</p>
<p>▲農會呈請扣輪此事發生後、湖州農民協會、以永順違反縣署禁令、在大水中開輪、損壞圩塘使農田浸水遂呈報縣省兩黨部、轉請浙江省政府、將此案從嚴懲辦、並將該局輪船扣留、經省府議决照准、令行湖州縣署、先將永安輪在湖州者扣留、不准開班、並禁止該局其他輪船開駛、</p>
<p>▲省府議罰巨欵浙省府接到報告、以現當苦於水災之際、對於商輪違令開航、冲毁圩塘、認爲事態重大、與出於誤損者不同、當提出省務會議、討論之下、公决該局輪旣冲毁圩塘、應責令修理、估計之下、遂議定科罰永順輪局洋一百二十萬元、充作修塘之用、罰欵未繳之前、不許復業、並將扣輪不放、</p>
<p>▲輪局設法疏通永順輪局方面、已令永新輪亦停在上海、不敢開行、一面則四出疏通、擬打消罰欵、無如省方堅執不允、嗣後永順方面、擬放棄湖州班、改行申潯班、而浙省府亦不准許、今此事正在雙方協議中、不知如何解决也、</p>
<p>▲申湖班輪全停該事發生後、湖州縣政府、業在附近河道中、設立水尺表、須照現有水頭下退一尺二寸、方許通行小輪、故滬上申湖班輪、若招商源通等各局、均一律停班矣、</p>

<p>來函勒贖二萬元</p>
<p>已拘獲男女二匪</p>
<p>小孩則尙無着落</p>
<p>住居重慶路馬安里一百九十九號門牌之本地婦人姚顧氏、現年二十五歲、夫早故、育有一子、年方八齡、取名菊生、活潑異常、本年七月七號下午三時許、姚顧氏挈領其子赴安南路太懷坊九十六號門牌氏之母親顧趙氏處游玩、詎菊生</p>
<p>突於門首失踪當經四出尋訪、竟如石沉大海、迨至九號、姚顧氏之胞弟顧培亨、突接匿名信函一封、謂菊生現在某處、身體安好、勿必掛念、氏得信後、始悉其愛子已落匪人之手、惶急萬分、但因匪黨并未叙明地址、</p>
<p>無從設法援救越二日、又接一信、勒索贖價二萬元、言明須派人自哈同路徒步至外灘、當有人來接洽、氏乃投報該管靜安寺捕房、飭派包探帮同查訪、一面由姚顧氏之母顧趙氏按照來信、步行至外灘、而探員則暗隨於後、結果、</p>
<p>匪黨并未會面隔數日、又接來信、約在鄭家木橋接洽、屆時果有一人到來談話、當被探員所拘、帶入捕房、詰據供稱名唐金生、在東昇旅館爲茶役、此事係受庽於一號房間内之客人李吉三囑託、餘事不知、當經中西探前往該旅館調查、則所謂李吉三者、已經聞風逃匿、并以唐與此案實未知情、乃將其釋放、迨至日前姚顧氏又接來信、改約於前晨九十時、在愛多亞路河南路口接洽、氏乃報捕、飭派華探目金養吾、帶同胞探四人、均</p>
<p>化裝黄包車夫前往所約地點守侯、一面由姚顧氏之母顧趙氏手携紙包一個、形如二萬元鈔票模樣、至該處徘徊、至十時許、果有一人乘坐李小堤坤之黄包車、至該處下車、見顧趙氏手携紙包在對面來回行走、乃囑託車夫李小坤</p>
<p>向前携取紙包李因不知内容、乃受命從顧趙氏手中取得紙包交給、正欲拖車奔跑之際、而探員已目擊一切、蜂擁上前、將車夫及乘車者一併拘獲、帶入靜安寺捕房、詢悉乘車者名朱松林、浦東人、承認與此案有關、并供明小孩姚菊生、現在南市馬天興弄二十號門牌蘇州婦人陸王氏（即二姐又名小阿姨）處、中西探乃帶同朱先生往公安局會同偵探、往將陸王氏拘獲、但</p>
<p>小孩仍無着落當向氏詰問孩在何處、而氏堅不承認、乃一併帶回捕房分别收押、昨晨解送第一特區法院形二庭、由吳廷琪推事提訊、即據捕房律師王耀堂起而陳述以上情形謂查得被告朱松林、即屬化名李吉三者、此事有茶役唐金生可以證明、且朱前與顧趙氏爲同居之房客、故對於姚顧氏家中之情形、均能明瞭、但於上月間曾、</p>
<p>有人冒充匪黨向姚顧氏處意圖詐索洋九十六元、案發被捕、解送簡易庭、訊明判决處徒刑兩月、今小孩姚菊生尙未查明、要求改期云云、繼據東昇旅館茶役唐金生投稱、七月十五號、被告朱松林到來、開一號房間、自稱名李吉三、</p>
<p>謂尙有一婦人名王氏者、須到來、故循環簿上書有李吉三·李王氏·兩人之姓名、但該氏以後未來、越三日、李怱命我往鄭家木橋桂圓店門首等候、謂如見有一身穿黑褲</p>
<p>白短衫之老嫗可向其索取紙包、内有衣服、因該老嫗係彼之親戚、彼無顔往見也、我一時受愚、故代往携取、詎爲探捕所拘、幸後問明我確無關係、故即釋放等詞、又據姚顧氏·顧趙氏·相繼投案、禀明一切、詰之被告朱松林供稱、</p>
<p>拐騙姚菊生時我未在塲、事後遇見被告陸王氏及氏之姊妹行李三姐與李之姘夫劉子雲談起始悉菊生藏匿於陸王氏處、事後我曾在漢口·宜昌·等處發信兩封致姚顧氏家、對於兩次遣人取欵之事、亦直認不諱、質之陸王氏、供開妓院、對於誘拐姚菊生藏置彼家及勒贖等事、均不承認、經吳推事核供、諭兩被告仍分别還押、候改期查明再訊、</p>

<p>我是一個中學畢業生、自從畢業後、因爲環境的關系、没有升學、我的素性是近於電機一門的、所以失學後、自己瞎摸、同時進了美國函授學校的機械科、那時學費只要每月五元、後來又爲了錢的關系没畢業、但是除了一部工場實習的一部份課本没有讚、論理的一部份是讀完了、同時又自己讀電學書、和研究無線電收音機、（那時開洛公司方始成立）和用手工製造應用的儀器、這樣盲人瞎馬的閙了五年光景、很有興味和心得經騐、我現在在此時的一點餬口本領、也是靠了這一點自學功夫、（我在電台管機務）不過現在覺得、（一）我所知道的太淺了、如果在此地這樣的小電力電台、終身其事、到也吧了、但是我希望前途有發展、能够到國際大電台去、那末學識自然不夠、要想再自己往上學去、但是問題來了、（二）我算學程太淺、只學到三角、（立體幾何及三角没有學過）如果看一本稍爲深一點的書、就非懂微積分不可、現在我想從頭把已學的代數三角温一遍後、再買書店中的高級中學的數學書、像高等代數、同解析幾何、微積分、那幾部書便於自修的、（三）我想找一個工廠實習位子、一方可以增加經騐、一方可以接近工程界、不知道上海可有這種機會没有、（四）我自學的目標、要辦到有應電機工程師檢定考試的學力、可以有做工程師的資格先生可以給我定一個有系統的讀書表嗎、如做工程師辦不到、低一級的電機界工務員的學力資格、是無論如何、我立志要做到、</p>

<h3 id="c172">學半個卡汾狄士 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>卡汾狄士Sir　Henry　Cavendish英國人，生於一七三一年，死於一八一零年。到今年雙十節恰恰是他的二百周紀念日。</p>
<p>他是一位有錢的科學家、是一位科學的有錢人。</p>
<p>他於一七六六年發明輕氣，當時稱它爲易燃空氣ImflammableＡ　；一七八四年又證明水爲易燃空氣與五分之一之尋常空氣爆炸而成，這五分之一之尋常空氣即拉瓦錫所稱之養氣Ｏxygen；一七九八年求得地球比重，從此整個的地球不必用稱而可以知道安的重要了。他的發明很多；這幾樣是他主要的貢獻。</p>
<p>卡汾狄士在學術上雖有很大的貢獻、但是秉性孤獨不與人往來，尤不喜見女人。家中偶用女僕、祇要被他看見、没有不被辭退的。晚年有人設宴表揚他的貢獻，他便從後門逃掉。臨終，他喚退了他惟一的僕人，使他可以一個人無牽無累的離開這世界。</p>
<p>他所做的科學實騐，多秘不示人。他死後五十年才有人將他的筆記發表。因此Cavendish　Selfish兩個字便結了一些因緣。自私的科學家從此乃有所屬，都以卡汾狄士作盾牌。地們學了半個卡汾狄士、其實是學了卡汾狄士較壞的一半而忘了他的較好的一半。他們祗管攀上科學之樹，揀熟的菓子一個子吃，把菓皮和核子往下摔。也不管樹底的弟兄能吃不能吃。他們學會了卡汾狄士之孤僻自私而忘了他的偉大的發明上的努力。</p>
<p>卡汾狄士死後、北梯羅Berthelot說：（化學是法國之科學，創學者拉瓦錫Lavoisier不朽）梭耳普Sir　Ed,Thorpe答辯說：（化學是一英國之科學，創學者卡汾狄士不朽）。孤高的卡汾狄士有靈，也必笑北梯羅與梭耳普之太無聊了。</p>

<p>— 荆夢蝶</p>
<p>錫城士女。當盛暑之天。莫不以公園品茗。爲惟一之消遣。蓋緑陰深處。足避驕陽。湫隘囂塵之城市。祇此爲清凉世界焉。顧余尤愛其涵碧橋一帶。曲池有荷。每值花時。輒倚徙闌干。臨流玩賞。往往至夜分乃去。憶有句云。（萬顆圓球走翠盤。一池碎月舖花影。）其情景之佳。可想見也。今夏池荷大放之時。正值大水汪洋之日。游人稀少。已多孤負。而余又以事小别兩旬。秋雨茂陵。相如早病。落花湖上。杜牧遲來。重到梁溪。征車乍下。即詣園中探視。惟見田田蓮葉。依然魚戲東西。花則三五亭亭而外。墜粉零脂。盡付水面文章已。紅藕香殘。青衫人老。一年容易。又是秋風。惟對此解語名花。聊賦傷懷短什。於是有殘荷一律云。采蓮歌罷暑初收。紅翠離披感舊游。花落不曾歸。濁溷。枝枯猶自託清流。幾經風雨炎凉變。一臥江湖景物秋。轉眼繁華成逝水。鴛鴦老大亦多愁。</p>

<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>▲每天的生活伊並且酷愛音樂。這是伊父親所給伊的影響。因爲伊父親乃是彼得格勒交響樂隊的領袖的緣故。伊所擅長的乃是鋼琴。爵士音樂也是伊所愛之一。所以每日下午四時後。走過伊家的人們。每每可以聽到鏗鏘悅耳的琴聲。海倫告訴記者說。（跳舞也是我所嗜愛的運動之一。我差不多每夜都要跳舞。）的確。伊是驕傲的。伊在跳舞廳裏常常給人家稱贊伊的舞姿是怎樣的婀娜。伊也愛游泳·跑冰·騎馬·駕駛汽車。伊自信地說。（我能把車子開得風馳電掣般快。）伊每天的生活。大概如下。早晨七時半起身。早餐後自己駕車到學校去。讀的是商科。回家午餐的時候居多。下午四時由校回家後。練習鋼琴或讀書。到晚餐時爲止。因爲伊愛早點兒吃。所以七時便用晚餐了。晚餐旣罷。去看影戲。或去跳舞。或和友人沿着霞飛路散步。</p>
<p>▲七時睡眠制　海倫說。（我想一個女孩子有七小時的睡眠夠了。）伊雖然這樣談。但在暑假時。伊却常常睡到十小時或十一小時左右。朋友很少。伊說伊僅有一個女友。名字呌做雷泰魯朋維。是伊的芳隣。海倫的母親生長於克利米亞。十七歲便以美麗名聞鄕里了。父親乃是彼得洛勒本地人。講起美麗的秘訣。海倫說伊一點没有。不過十分注意伊的健康和食料而已。據伊說伊從來没有像美國電影明星那樣减過食。</p>
<p>▲嗜食酸辣品　記者問。（女士所愛吃的是些什麽食品。）伊似乎同有明白這句話。是對於伊的美麗上有聨帶關係的。便隨口答說。（酸辣的食品。）記者不禁很驚異的跟着伊也說了一句（酸辣的食品。）（不錯。酸辣的食品。）伊用音樂似的聲音答我。伊向未飲過牛奶和吃過鷄蛋。肉似乎是伊所愛吃的食品之一。</p>
<p>▲龍非池中物　記者問。（女士從前加入過浴美競艶大會麽。（（没有。這是破題兒第一次有許多人說我是一個小孩子。但我自信。我怎樣也不是一個小孩子了。）伊說伊有到舞臺上去的奢望。可是伊又不願意把伊埋没在像一間屋子大的上海。伊想到好來塢和紐約去發展伊演劇的天才。伊不吸烟。但有時却喝點兒香檳酒。總之。海倫女士乃是一個美麗而年青的女孩子。伊除了伊旣有的華麗的衣服。父母的慈愛。供伊消費的巨量的金錢。一二輛汽車。跳舞廳裏尋快樂以外。伊便需要那些如伊才說的音樂和一個年青的丈夫來使得伊的生活更美滿了。</p>

<p>— 綺雲</p>
<p>隔鄰爲粤南人居。其三樓則别賃之一吳下女郎。其行蹤似頗詭秘。出以暮夜。歸則在晨曦中。當叩門聲作。恒擾我清夢。家人胥鄙視之。謂此女郎沈浸於都市夜生活中。殆必若西方故事所述之（凡派亞）也者。愚亦以爲然。因有好奇之想。謀剌探其夜何所往。顧久而不得。漸亦漠然置之。</p>
<p>一夕。愚從友人游。入某舞塲。對座一舞伴。正鄰家女也。遂以告友人。即起而與無。姿態妙曼。滋可人意。詢其姓名。則爲朱麗琳。</p>
<p>久之。愚遂與麗琳稔。麗琳漸以身世爲愚縷述。輒欷歔不置。蓋已飽經世變者矣。其言曰。（良人者。奚可仰望而終身。女子未嫁時。固猶一林鳥。自由自在。以天眞自全。旣嫁。則鳳凰在笯。其幸者。爲一玩物以自安。其不幸者。則磨折以自斃。儂於十六歲嫁。夫子相待固不惡。然繼乃見誘於一蕩娃。竟忍心捨儂而去。不得已。儂遂他適。爲生活計。無可奈何。然命途多乖。益有遇人不淑之嘆。不久復賦仳離。而輾轉淪胥。今乃操舞業。非所願也。猶不得已耳。）</p>
<p>其事固平庸無足奇。然紅顔薄命。今古同悲。彼燈紅酒緑塲中。縱極玉笑珠香之樂。而滿袖啼痕。或儘多背人彈涙者在也。</p>
<p>愚乃憶及史璜蓀女士曾有一（女伶情史）之佳片。描繪一女伶之浪漫及隱痛。無微不至。因思舞榭女郎。其所遭遇。苟有善爲描繪者一描繪之。則無論爲浪漫。爲隱痛。當有千百倍之奇詭。奈何西方今日之所謂有聲歌舞片者。竟千篇一律。獨以舞塲之繁華缛麗爲浮面之粉飾乎。</p>
<p>最近乃知民衆國產有聲電影公司攝製一（如此天堂）片。其特長則在於繁華缛麗以外。獨多刻骨之描繪。舉凡家庭隱痛。社會黑暗。胥可由一舞女之轉變。而得甚深刻甚生動之印象。使觀衆由浪漫之享樂以外。得一至熱烈之剌激。會邀麗琳一往觀之。殆更有同情之感乎。</p>

<p>李經羲</p>
<p>袁世凱旣解散國會。設政治會議。倡音將改造庶會。李仲軒（經羲）時客都門。營進甚亟。世凱雅不欲畀以重任。而稱其富有辯才。予以斯會議長。經羲大喜過望。頗自振作。會終。授參政。殊怏怏。對人言。輒以有功不被賞。志欲督蜀粤。爲世凱所聞。召其子國筠入觀。政事堂左丞楊杏城（士琦）復誇國筠才識跨𥦣。堪膺方面。遂簡廣東巡按。國筠辭赴新任。項城告之曰。若翁精神才力勝吾百倍。待以歲月。俟吾任期告終。繼統華厦者。匪異人任也。國筠唯唯。退而陳諸父。經羲頓足曰。休矣。蓋至是始知世凱尊而不親。疏而不信。乃避居析津。外傳右丞錢幹丞（能訓）將量移經羲以書抵士琦。謂年雖老而心猶壯。閒居殊不慣。翊贊樞機。固所願望。士琦持書眎。世凱。示推位讓賢。世凱曰。吾仲何遽言去。幹丞亦不令其遠離。爲我語仲軒。得當必借重。少選。審計院院長丁振鐸卒於官。以經羲代之。令中叙入（未到任以前著李兆珍代理）句。經羲居津。頃刻且入京就職。憤世凱玩弄。辭不之官。自是終項城之任。暫不談政事。迨黄陂當國。拜粗閣之命。甫三日。遇復避这戀。狼倉南歸。旋卒。其鄕人龔仙舟（心湛）方筦内部。爲文乞執政段氏明令褒恤。蓋經羲與祺瑞心湛。皆合肥人也。</p>

<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>（我是傻瓜？你才傻呢。一個人總得有些正直之氣，誰差的，該派他差。剛才我想勸勸李先生，被你的話剪住了，我不曾講出口，我還傻麽？）陳先生解釋他的道理。</p>
<p>（你還不傻瓜？傻瓜！傻瓜！我判定你是傻瓜，你怎樣？）</p>
<p>（那麽你是傻婆！）陳先生帶着滑稽態度，多份是開玩笑。</p>
<p>（你是笨賊！）陳夫人却沈下了臉，當眞的駡了。</p>
<p>（怎麽你駡起我來了？）</p>
<p>（我爲什塺麽不駡你！你自己想一想，别家夫婦的事，要你去攬是非做幹麽？旁人知道了，决不說你是傻瓜的，也許還說你過意帮着蘭珍，是有特别作用呢。）</p>
<p>（蘭珍是你的朋友，我帮伊，一半是瞧伊可憐，一半也因爲你的關係，你不要喝乾醋，又把這一件事當一個問題討論！像你這麽兇的妻子，做丈夫的還敢動一動？）</p>
<p>陳先生的辯解，反使陳夫人眞生了疑心，動了肝火，便嚴厲地質問陳先生。大概朋友間偶然有句話高低，有時只要有一方面能涵養的，便不會吵嘴，越是夫婦，責善過嚴，反容易衝突。所以他們便閙了起來。</p>
<p>陳先生的確很憐惜蘭珍，同時聨想到自己夫人的用錢浪費，一些也不體恤他掙錢的辛苦，心裏不免生了怨苦。這種怨苦。平時從來没有吐露過一些，現在他得到了這樣的機會，便發洩出來。自己也止不住了。</p>
<p>（你疑心我，我可以對天發誓，我的心，比任何人都正直。你說，我有什麽事落在你的眼裏，或聽在你的耳中？但是我是很信任你，你雖然常和李經伯一塊兒打牌，一同上跳舞塲，有時也遲到兩三點鐘回家，假使我要疑心你有什麽不規矩，我是可以嚴厲地干涉你的。你自己想，你這幾年裏，那一件事是顧憐着我的？我的襪子破了，你不給我補，但是你自己買絲襪，每雙五元半的，不買不必說，買時總是半打一買，每月你一個人所化的交際費，要多少？我每晚至遲八九點鐘一定回家了，你呢？）</p>

<p>昨日洋客秈均形疲軟、因連日本客均無鉅胃、人心一致望小、貨主尤多急求脫手、本街散戶與囤客乃趁此機會、撳價收買、統市成交台州白米千餘包、價十三元四角至十二元九角、比前日小三四分、小絞現米八百包、價十三元四角三分至四角、小近角許、小絞九月份二百噸、價六兩三錢、乃小有二錢四分之多、惟敏黨米有鄕莊去路、購去一百包、價十三元二角、反比上次售開者大有二角云、</p>
<p>國外新交易因產地報漲、未有成交、昨日電訊各米均較較市址漲二角左右云、</p>

<p>杭紹兩屬各縣農民、今歲官廳提倡飼育秋蠶、故均提早進行、飼蟻激暢、天氣初甚晴喛、收蟻後發育頗佳、詎至三眠中、發生大風雨、繼以大水、各鄕所孵之土種蠶議、備受損害、近正早帮上簇、而晚帮大眠旺葉、而霪雨天寒、蠶蟻大半發現白殭、間有軟化不起者、今歲浙屬秋繭、收成至多不過五六分、新繭將次上市、杭紹兩屬繭行、今明日可望開秤云、</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Hunan Flood Relief Association in Beijing cabled Song Ziwen, Zhu Qinglan, Xu Shiying, Kong Xiangxi, and various committee members of the National Government's Flood Relief Association on the evening of the 10th:  "The Hunan Province flood is extremely severe. Statistics from various county reports and investigations by our association's personnel indicate that as many as 57 counties have suffered severely, seemingly surpassing Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces. Therefore, the Disaster Relief Committee's distribution of emergency relief, ranked as first-class, has already been finalized. Upon reading news reports, we learned that the aid allocation bill of your association's 9th meeting only grants Hunan Province 100,000 yuan, comparatively the smallest amount. Our province's fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai are all surprised.  While you gentlemen may have taken great pains in overall planning, the flood surveys of various provinces have not been completely accurate, and statistics have not been published. Revising previous cases seems to lack a basis. We request that your association resubmit for review to respect the facts and comfort the victims. In addition to sending our association's Shanghai-based members Nie Lusheng and Ye Kaixin to attend and present the case, we hereby cable to present our case and pray for a prompt reply."

<p>Telegram Reply Sternly Refutes Chen and Li</p>
<p>(Changsha) He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Four Route Armies, and all his generals support the Central Government consistently. On the 7th, Chen Jitang and Li Zongren sent a telegram to He, engaging in blatant divisive tactics, attempting to alienate the Central Government from Hunan. He saw through their trickery and sent a stern telegram reply on the 8th, explaining the greater principles and urging them to awaken. The original telegram stated, "The banditry in Hunan Province has not yet been pacified, and natural disasters continue, leaving scars everywhere, desperately awaiting rescue. Jian is devoted to his hometown and is dedicated to clearing bandits and providing disaster relief. The Central Government is concerned about the suffering of the local people and has encouraged Jian. Regarding the matters you mentioned, my conscience is clear, and according to reason, it can be determined that they are definitely not true. Please dispel your distant thoughts. However, it has recently been reported that your troops are frequently invading the Hunan border and gathering local bandits to use as scouts. The violence has angered the people. Taking advantage of others' disasters is inhumane. Starting a war without a just cause is what military strategists avoid. What exactly is your intention? I am confused. I hope you will carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks and not incite conflict." (Special dispatch of the 9th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Nakamura Incident, the diplomatic authorities stated that they did not know about this matter when they met with Chinese and Japanese reporters last time because they had not received a report. The Japanese side used this as an excuse, saying that the authorities said that the Japanese side fabricated the facts. However, the diplomatic authorities did not admit that this fact existed, but they also did not say that the Japanese side fabricated it. The Japanese side made a mountain out of a molehill, causing international attention. In order to clarify the truth of the matter, the diplomatic authorities plan to announce the truth of the matter and the fact that the other party intends to have special rights in Manchuria and Mongolia to the international community at an appropriate time. As for the negotiations on this case in the Northeast, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a report. (Special dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e19">The Entire Nakamura Case is Due to Japanese Fabrication <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to an investigation by a certain party, the Nakamura case is entirely a fabrication by the Japanese. Nakamura is a retired soldier who has lived in the Northeast as a ronin for a long time. Because he owed Korean merchants a lot of money, he could not repay it, so he declared himself missing in order to evade the debt. The Japanese side then used the excuse of being victimized, resulting in a serious diplomatic incident between China and Japan. This is a consistent strategy of Japan's implementation of its active Manchurian-Mongolian policy after the Wan-Xian Massacre. The Japanese military also wants to take this opportunity to publicize to the people in the country that Japan's military strength in Manchuria and Mongolia is weak, in order to smoothly pass this year's Japanese army budget. This is the reason why the Japanese military is advocating a tough stance. Tang Erhe went to Japan to discuss the Nakamura incident and has now returned to the country. He will arrive in Ping tonight and will visit Zhang Xueliang for instructions. (Special dispatch of the 10th)</p>

<p>The past two or three months can truly be described as a time of troubles for Sino-Japanese relations. The Wan case and the Korean case have arisen one after another and have not yet been resolved. Now, suddenly, the so-called Captain Nakamura incident has occurred. According to the Japanese government's published information regarding the so-called Captain Nakamura incident, it is briefly stated that (Chen Army Infantry Captain Nakamura Reitaro, and former Cavalry Corporal Iisugi Entaro, under orders from the General Staff Headquarters, along with Iki Entaro, owner of the Angangxi Angrong Inn, and others, a total of five people, carrying Chinese passports, departed from Harbin in early June to inspect the Xing'an Mountains. They originally planned to return in two months. However, after departing, there was no news. The Harbin Special Agency dispatched personnel to investigate. According to reports, Nakamura's party arrived at Min'anzhen near Geggenmiao, the end point of the Taosuo Railway, around June 27. While they were dining at a restaurant there, several officers and soldiers belonging to the Third Regiment of the Xing'an Reclamation Corps entered the restaurant for inspection. They ordered Nakamura's party to stop traveling. Showing them their passports was also ineffective. They were arrested. Six guns and personal belongings were looted. Without presenting any reason, Nakamura's party was tied up and shot in the mountains behind the barracks. On July 1, wood was piled up to burn the bodies. This news was obtained from a Chinese soldier who shared Nakamura's remaining money.) (August 18, Japanese government released the Nakamura incident in Tokyo, Osaka and other places in Japan). As for the evidence it presented, it stated that there were many people who witnessed Nakamura's killing. However, their names cannot be published. In addition, there is Nakamura's gold watch and other items, which are said to have been taken by Han Yugang, the commander of the Third Regiment of the Reclamation Army. However, according to our investigation, there is no concrete evidence of the travel and death of Nakamura and others. Since this case was promoted by the Japanese authorities, the Japanese people, both government and public, were like crazy and insane. The situation is extremely serious. Their advocacy of toughness is even more consistent, as if they will immediately implement their so-called emergency measures. Looking at the opinions of all parties recently conveyed by Japanese telegrams, we can imagine the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>We believe that the occurrence of this case is definitely not as simple as the facts themselves. There is actually a serious background behind it. Taking the Wan case and the Korean case together, and taking the current claims of the Japanese government and public into account, this serious background has clues that can be found. We will first refute the facts of this case, and then discuss the real cause of the sudden occurrence of this case.</p>
<p>(1) According to the Japanese government, Nakamura did have a passport. However, there are many doubts about the names, occupations and purposes stated on the passport. According to our Zhong Yu Tan (this newspaper’s Harbin special dispatch on the 9th), the Japanese consulate in Harbin sent a passport for a Nakamura industry merchant to travel to the three eastern provinces in May to request a signature. The missing Nakamura may be this person. This further proves that Nakamura's passport must be a kind of trick. He forged the name and profession and falsely received it. And the passport stated that he was other profession, but Nakamura was actually an active army captain, and he carried as many as six guns. Did he have any actions that went beyond the scope specified on the passport and caused an unexpected accident? Who can be sure. Even if Nakamura really goes missing, our country is not responsible for any kind of responsibility.</p>
<p>(2) The Xing'an area is not peaceful. Mongolian bandits come and go constantly. Our country has already notified Japan to prohibit foreigners from traveling. The regulations are in place. Now Nakamura ignores our country’s notification and takes on a special mission, deliberately venturing deep. Accidents that occur are self-inflicted. Our country is not responsible for any responsibility.</p>
<p>(3) Even if Nakamura's party was really killed, the personal and material evidence cited cannot be used as strong evidence that they were killed by our officers and soldiers. It is said that someone reported it. Why not announce their names? Several soldiers divided the relics. Why did the gold watch and other items fall into the hands of senior officer Han Yugang? Since they were in Han's hands, who were the people who saw it? Vague and confusing. Highly questionable. We say it is unfounded. It is also possible to bribe ignorant people to fabricate facts in order to achieve their great desires. There are secret behaviors between international countries everywhere. We cannot but have this assumption. We cannot but prevent it.</p>
<p>(4) Even if Nakamura's party was really killed by our officers and soldiers, the Japanese provoked Koreans to discriminate against Chinese, and numerous overseas Chinese were brutally killed. The case has been pending until now and has not been resolved. Today, only three or four people including Nakamura died. They are rampant and advocating taking final measures. How strict are they to others? How lenient are they to themselves? Is there still such a thing as justice in the world? If the Japanese side wants to quickly resolve the Nakamura incident, shouldn’t the Wan case and the Korean case be resolved first?</p>

<h3 id="e55">Japanese Representative Expresses Military Reduction Stance at League of Nations <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Willing to Cooperate Sincerely with All Countries</p>
<p>Expansion of Air Force Implied</p>
<p>Britain and America Sympathetic to Grandi's Proposal</p>
<p>Cecil Discusses Economic Crisis</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency Geneva 9th - The League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting today. First, the Japanese Chief Delegate, Aizawa, spoke, saying that the Japanese government is determined to cooperate sincerely and spare no effort in the upcoming military reduction conference next year to promote its success. Japan now views the military reduction draft as the recognized basis for future negotiations. Japan has twice reduced its naval armaments, once after the Washington Conference and once after the signing of the London Naval Agreement. However, the national defense forces and war materiel have not been reduced, because Japan's military, especially its air force, has not yet reached the level it should have for national defense. Next, the Canadian representative, Bolton, rose to ask the assembly to do its utmost to ensure the success of the military reduction conference, saying that if it fails this time, the whole world will suffer adverse effects, and the harm will be unimaginable. Next, the Romanian Foreign Minister, Mironescu, spoke, taking the position of France (which requires security guarantees before disarmament), and said that Romania cannot disarm until it concludes non-aggression treaties with its four neighboring countries and the Soviet Union. Next, the Indian representative, Sir Laine, expressed gratitude for the League of Nations' expansion of its work to Asia, and said that this move would make the League's relationship with Asia even closer. All parties expressed satisfaction with Mexico's accession to the League of Nations. From now on, South America's dissatisfaction with the League of Nations should be able to be reversed. The general opinion is that if Mexico is already a member of the League of Nations, the recent anti-Chinese incidents in Mexico could have been resolved peacefully earlier. The League of Nations Assembly's special committee adopted the proposal of the British representative, Cecil, tonight to cancel all banquets, because during the League of Nations Assembly, representatives from various countries often hold frequent social gatherings, and Cecil believes that countries all over the world are in difficulty today, so they should cherish resources.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Geneva 10th - The British Chief Delegate, Cecil, gave a speech at the League of Nations meeting today, which was warmly applauded. Cecil said that no government can tolerate the idea of ​​canceling the military reduction conference in February next year. Foreign Minister Grandi surprisingly advocated suspending all military preparations before the military reduction conference is convened. He expressed his deep sympathy for this proposal. He hopes that France and Germany can understand each other. He believes that this move can eliminate 75% of the main causes of political unrest in the world. As for the outline of British foreign policy, the first is to focus on world peace. Cecil concluded that if the world's financial situation is not quickly remedied, all countries will be forced to expand the suspension of cash payments, otherwise the value of national currencies will depreciate.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Washington 9th - It is reported that the US government has shown friendly sympathy for Italy's proposal for a military holiday in Geneva, but there has been no indication of whether it will try to promote its proposal.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency Paris 10th - Le Matin reported that the Geneva International League of Nations Council has decided to invite the United States to send a permanent observer to Geneva to participate in the League's work and all matters as a semi-official special envoy. It is also reported that the United States has expressed its consent to this. However, Le Matin's commentary stated that according to French political circles, this move may still not make the relationship between the League of Nations and the United States closer, because Washington is temporarily focused on cooperation in saving the economic plan, and its representative to the League is only temporary.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency Geneva 10th - Italy's reply on the current status of military equipment was released by the League of Nations Secretariat today. It stated that although Italy's financial resources can support 500,000 soldiers, there are currently only 230,000 officers and soldiers, 1,500 army aircraft, and this year's military expenditure is 6.2 billion lira.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency Berlin 10th - The date for French Prime Minister Laval and Foreign Minister Briand to visit German authorities is scheduled to be September 26th. They will arrive in Berlin in the evening and leave for home on the morning of the 29th, so that they have two full days to discuss matters leisurely.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu Tokyo 10th - Regarding the resolution of the Nakamura Incident, the core members of the Foreign Ministry and the Army and Navy will hold a meeting on the evening of the 11th to exchange opinions. The Army intends to propose that railway negotiations cannot be left solely to the Ministry of Railways, but a fundamental policy for Manchuria and Mongolia must be established, with the Foreign Ministry taking the lead in negotiations. Colonel Dohihara is also expected to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu Tokyo 10th - Colonel Dohihara, who returned to Japan to report on the Nakamura Incident, met with Chief of Staff Kanaya at 10:00 AM today, presenting material evidence and witness testimony to explain the truth of the incident, and claimed that before he left, the Chinese side regarded Japan's practical actions, from a financial and diplomatic point of view, as impossible, so they planned to perfunctorily deal with it. To solve this problem, the problems in Manchuria and Mongolia must be fundamentally solved. In the afternoon, he also met with Land Minister Minami and stated the same opinions. The military will hold a joint meeting of the highest leaders with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the General Staff Headquarters to decide on specific countermeasures and negotiate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct Colonel Dohihara to handle the matter.</p>

<p>Henderson Criticizes Balanced Budget Plan</p>
<p>Says Consideration Should Not Be Given to the Poor</p>
<p>▲ Reuters London 10th - The General Council of Trades Unions Congress reconvened in Bristol this morning. Because yesterday, unemployed workers from South Wales tried to break into the venue, reserve police were patrolling around the venue today. Another reason was that the Communist Party had announced that it would hold a demonstration during Henderson's speech. When Henderson entered the venue, the delegates all stood up and cheered to welcome him. Henderson said that the previous Labour Cabinet's attempt to balance the budget was a mistake, because when considering the issue of equal sacrifice, consideration should not be given to the poorest of the poor first. He also said that although he is a staunch supporter of free trade, he advocates trying to levy a tithe of tariffs as an emergency measure. This income should be used to relieve unemployment. He would rather do this than greatly reduce unemployment benefits. When the London Conference was held in July, when he was in Paris on official business, the plan to organize a national government had already been discussed. The previous cabinet voted by a majority to reduce unemployment benefits by 10%, but unexpectedly, an outside party reserved the right to increase the amount of the reduction. As a result, he and his colleagues completely rejected this proposal, and the amount of 12.5 million pounds could not be resolved.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters London 9th - Conservative Party leader Baldwin moved in the House of Commons tonight to limit MPs' private affairs during this special session to one hour per day. If government affairs are completed early, the House of Commons can adjourn. This motion aroused opposition from the Labour Party. After two hours of debate, Baldwin moved to end the debate. The assembly approved it by a vote of 306 to 212, and the motion to limit time also passed by a large majority of 93 votes. The assembly also passed another government motion stipulating that the supplementary budget bill proposed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden tomorrow must be implemented after being passed in the evening to avoid the possibility of certain goods profiting by taking advantage of the opportunity before the tax increase.</p>

<p>Provincial Merger Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu Tokyo 10th - Railway Minister Eguchi suddenly resigned this morning due to illness. Prime Minister Wakatsuki entered the Imperial Palace at 11:00 AM to report to the Emperor and request that the former Colonial Minister succeed him. The position of Colonial Minister will be concurrently held by Prime Minister Wakatsuki. The appointment ceremony will be held at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu Tokyo 10th - The resignation of Railway Minister Eguchi is because the issue of provincial merger has become politicized. He is concerned that the cabinet will break down, so he voluntarily resigned after the administrative reorganization was successful, so that the provincial merger issue also ended. This issue has now been resolved satisfactorily. The Secretary-General of the Minsei Party, Yamamichi, said that Minister Eguchi is an important member of the Cabinet, and his retirement is extremely regrettable. He resigned due to illness, so there is no way to keep him. The former Minister Hara will succeed him, and the foundation of the Cabinet will not be shaken.</p>

<p>Prophecy Turns Into Reality</p>
<p>Ms. Johnson Returns to London</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Tokyo 10th - American aviators Moyer and Allen departed from Tokyo by plane 56 hours ago, intending to fly across the Pacific to Seattle to win a prize of 50,000 yen from the Asahi Shimbun. According to the pre-arranged plan, they could reach their destination within 40 hours. However, since flying out, there has been no trace of them so far. It is feared that they have suffered misfortune. According to reports, the two aviators have exhausted their resources in preparing for this, and they could not even afford the hotel bill, so they borrowed money. The insufficient amount was mortgaged to the hostess with a diamond ring. This departure was determined to burn their boats and disregard their lives, but unexpectedly they still encountered misfortune, which is very sad.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu Tokyo 10th - Moyer said when he departed, "(If I can reach the shore, I will be imprisoned, otherwise I will go to sea.)" Although it was a joke, it seems to have become a confession. He said this because the car had an accident before departure. If he were an American, he should have been convicted.</p>

When asked about the Siberian puppy given to her by a Russian in Kazan, Amy replied that when she landed at the Linben Airport to refuel, two policemen took the dog away, saying that according to regulations, the dog must be inspected for epidemics before it can be returned to its original owner after six months. Amy also told a Reuters interviewer that the aviation business from London to Tokyo is absolutely feasible. She learned a lot of lessons on this flight, but she couldn't think of them at the moment.</p>

<p>Hankou Telegram to all newspapers: Our Hubei Province is located on the Yangtze and Han Rivers, and has the most lakes and swamps. It has been known as a "water country" since ancient times. There are often floods in summer, but there has never been such a vast area of ​​flooding as this year, covering more than 40 counties, with millions of people affected. Since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain, and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have experienced flash floods. The waters of the Yangtze and Han Rivers have risen sharply at the same time, causing dikes to collapse, overflowing and spreading, submerging fields and houses, floating crops, livestock, and people were also carried away by the waves. Those who were lucky enough to escape death and survive were homeless, unable to find food, and the pain of displacement and the tragedy of separation are truly heartbreaking for those who see it and make those who hear it feel sad. Even in Wuhan, the special zones and concessions in Hankou, as well as places outside the city such as Chenjiaji, and the Nanh Lake and the area outside Wenchangmen and Wushengmen in Wuchang, are also a vast expanse of water, with no end in sight, several feet deep in some places, and several feet shallow in others. Residents are sad, businesses are closed, and there are sighs of "raising your foot and getting fish", and the sadness of destroying the stove and squatting on the side. The refugees gathered on Houhu and Zhanggong Embankment are like ants clinging to the beach. Apart from their naked bodies, they have nothing else. They are dying, bowing their heads and crying together. This scene and this situation are unbearable to describe. Compared with other provinces affected by the disaster at the same time, it is even more tragic. Cheng Jun is deeply worried about this great disaster. In addition to establishing the Hubei Flood Relief Association and telegraphing the central government to quickly allocate huge sums of money for emergency relief to save the people, we also ask all of you to act with compassion and take action to provide relief.

<h3 id="e64">Actual Situation of the Jiangbei Canal Embankment Breach <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Inspection Results by the Ministry of Interior's Huai River Regulation Commission</p>
<p>On the morning of August 26th, the eastern embankment of the Grand Canal breached in twenty-seven locations, turning the eight counties of the Lower Canal region into a vast swamp. The devastation was even more severe than the Qingshuitan breach during the fifth year of the Tongzhi reign. The Ministry of Interior, responsible for national flood defense, dispatched section chief Chen Zhan'en. The Huai River Regulation Commission, believing the Canal's problems stemmed from unmanaged Huai River floods, sent acting chief engineer Xu Kai. The Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society studied the breach, prepared to advise the government on relief measures, and dispatched vice president Li Shutian and director Sun Fushi to conduct on-site inspections, covering all breach locations, from September 1st to the evening of the 3rd, totaling three days. Yesterday, the Huai River Regulation Commission released the inspection report and proposed relief measures, as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Major Causes of the Canal Embankment Breach Based on personal observation of the breaches and interviews with local residents, the primary causes of the Canal embankment breach can be summarized into three points: (A) This year's water levels in various sections of the Huai River Canal were unprecedented in decades, and the paths for diverting the Huai River into the Yangtze River and the sea have not yet been fully developed. The Huai River floodwater was held in the Gaobao and Shaobo lakes, causing the water level at the Royal Horse Head water gauge on the Canal to reach over nineteen feet for half a month up to the date of the breach. (B) The western embankment of the Lower Canal has been in disrepair for years, leaving it incomplete. Although the three dams leading to the sea were opened, the water continued to rise, completely submerging the western embankment of the Lower Canal, turning the river and lakes into one. The water from Gaobao and Shaobo lakes directly impacted the eastern embankment, and the sudden bends and curves in the river channel intensified the scouring action. (C) On the night of August 25th, a strong northwesterly wind blew. According to the report published by the Xujiahui Observatory, the center of the hurricane was very close to the Lower Canal, causing violent waves reaching over ten feet high. Overnight, the canal embankment breached in over twenty-seven locations across three hundred li, causing widespread flooding.</p>
<p>▲ Situation of the Canal Embankment Breach Since the primary causes of the eastern embankment breach of the Lower Canal have been stated above, the details of the breach situation from this survey are listed below:</p>
<p>Location Number of Breaches Approximate Length Notes</p>
<p>Jiangdu Section</p>
<p>Six Gates Four Total: 40 zhang Two have dried out</p>
<p>Majiagou Two Total: 50 zhang Shallow breach, has dried out</p>
<p>Sun Chicken Feather Duster Two Total: 70 zhang</p>
<p>South of Shaobo Town Seven Total: approximately 90 zhang Has dried out</p>
<p>South of Shaobo Wanshou Palace One Over 10 zhang Shallow breach, has dried out</p>
<p>North of Shaobo Wanshou Palace One Over 10 zhang Shallow breach, has dried out</p>
<p>North of Zhaoguan Dam One 450 zhang</p>
<p>Lower Head</p>
<p>Lotus Pond One 60 zhang</p>
<p>North of Lai Sheng Convent One Over 30 zhang</p>
<p>(South of Lu Jin)</p>
<p>Gaobao Section</p>
<p>South of Thirty Shops One 60 zhang</p>
<p>(North of Lu Jin)</p>
<p>South of Little Cheluo One 50 zhang</p>
<p>(Yuehe Head)</p>
<p>Gaoyou Seven Dukes Hall One 30 zhang</p>
<p>Royal Horse Head One 10 zhang</p>
<p>Temple Alley Entrance One 90 zhang</p>
<p>Resist the Army Tower One Over 150 zhang</p>
<p>▲ Disaster Situation in the Lower Canal Region The eight counties of the Lower Canal region, including Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Taixian, Dongtai, Yancheng, and Fumin, are bounded by the abandoned Yellow River to the north, the Tongyang Canal to the south, the sea to the east, and the eastern embankment of the Lower Canal to the west, which protects against the floodwaters of the Huai River. Whenever the dams leading to the Yangtze River are insufficient to discharge the water, the dams leading to the sea are opened, using the Lower Canal region to discharge into the sea. The Lower Canal is one or two zhang below the water level of the Lower Canal, and there are no major rivers to drain the water. Furthermore, the Fan Gong embankment obstructs the flow. The coastal areas are higher than the hinterland of the Lower Canal, preventing smooth flow into the sea. Therefore, even in years when only the dams leading to the sea are opened, the Lower Canal region must retain the Huai River floodwater for four or five days. This year's rainfall has been particularly heavy, and the low-lying areas of the Lower Canal region were already full. In addition, the Xin San Dam south of Cheluo was opened on August 24th, releasing a massive flow of 2,300 cubic meters per second, which accumulated for twenty-three days, and the people's lives were already unbearable. On the morning of August 26th, the canal embankment breached in twenty-seven locations, totaling 8,000 feet, and the water from Gaobao Lake flowed eastward in full force. By September 2nd, the water level of the Canal had dropped sharply by eight feet, turning the plains along the Lower Canal into a vast swamp. The loss of life and property is incalculable (awaiting further investigation).</p>
<p>▲ Relief Methods The severity and impact of this disaster caused by the breach of the eastern embankment of the Lower Canal are as described above. Therefore, relief measures must be planned and implemented promptly to save the millions of victims in the eight counties of the Lower Canal region. The resettlement of refugees, food supply, preparation of cotton-padded clothing, and all relief efforts for winter and spring are already being planned and implemented by the National Flood Relief Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, so there is no need to elaborate further. The immediate measures that should be taken to repair the breaches in the eastern embankment of the Lower Canal, implement drainage projects in the Lower Canal region, renovate the western and eastern embankments of the Lower Canal, and expedite the diversion of Huai River water into the Yangtze River and the sea, are described separately below:</p>
<p>(A) Repairing the Breaches in the Eastern Embankment The eastern embankment of the Lower Canal has a total of twenty-seven breaches, large and small, with a total length of about 8,000 feet. Except for two breaches near the Six Gates that have dried up, and seven breaches in the southern section of Shaobo, as well as the breaches south and north of Wanshou Palace, which have also dried up, there are still over 6,000 feet of breaches with a strong eastward flow. Among them, the breaches north of Zhaoguan Dam, Lotus Pond in Lower Head, Lai Sheng Convent, Thirty Shops, Little Cheluo South, Seven Dukes Hall, Temple Alley Entrance, and Resist the Army Tower are the longest and most dangerous. The breaches have been scoured for a long time, and there is a fear that they will be level with the canal bed. In the future, not only will there be overspill at medium water levels, but it will also be difficult to stop the flow even at low water levels. If measures are not taken to close the breaches as soon as possible, this year's autumn harvest will be hopeless, and next year's planting will also be impossible. Houses cannot be repaired, and the people of the eight counties will have nowhere to live. The livelihood crisis may lead to nationwide unrest. However, the cost of repairing the breaches, using the old method of wood and earth for the smaller breaches and modern methods for the larger breaches, using wooden frames and rubble to close them, may require more than two million yuan (detailed figures to be estimated). It is feared that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will not be able to raise the funds in a short period. It is now known that the Central Government has established a National Flood Relief Committee to raise relief funds, and there is a proposal to issue a large amount of public bonds. To relieve the flood disaster in the Lower Canal region, repairing the breaches in the eastern embankment of the Lower Canal is of utmost importance. It is proposed that the National Government order the National Flood Relief Committee to take immediate responsibility for this breach repair project. We should also learn from the time-consuming experience of purchasing and transporting stones for repairing the Yongding River breach in Hebei Province eighteen years ago and start bidding for large pieces of rubble in advance. Once the water level drops slightly and work can begin, the breaches should be closed simultaneously, with the goal of closing all breaches in the shortest possible time. (B) Drainage Project for the Lower Canal Region Currently, the water depth in the Lower Canal region averages about six or seven feet, and the breaches continue to flow eastward. Before the breaches are closed, the water level will continue to rise. Since the ports to the sea are extremely congested, if drainage projects are not implemented during the retention period, it is feared that the land will not dry out before the heavy rains of next summer and autumn, let alone allow for planting this autumn and spring. Therefore, for the sake of the people's survival and the national economy, it is necessary to implement the drainage project for the Lower Canal region as soon as possible. As mentioned in the previous section, the Jiangsu Provincial Government may not be able to afford it for the time being. This drainage project is also an urgent task for relieving the flood disaster in the Lower Canal region. Therefore, it is also proposed that the National Government order the National Flood Relief Committee to handle it properly and quickly. The scope of the project includes dredging the ports to the sea to facilitate flow into the sea (and building sluice gates at the estuaries to prevent saltwater intrusion for long-term benefit), and opening more diversion canals into the ports, so that the land of the eight counties in the Lower Canal region can be dried out in the shortest possible time. (C) Renovation of the Eastern Embankment and Repair of the Western Embankment of the Lower Canal The eastern embankment of the Lower Canal has breached in twenty-seven locations because the embankments have been in disrepair for years, are incomplete, and have too many gaps. The main current directly impacts the eastern embankment of the Lower Canal, causing severe scouring at every curve. At the highest flood levels, the lakes and canals are connected. When strong northwesterly winds and waves occur, they cross the eastern embankment and scour its back. The insufficient height of the eastern embankment is obvious. Since the diversion of the Huai River into the Yangtze River and the sea has not been completed, the eastern embankment of the Lower Canal will continue to bear the responsibility of protecting the eight counties of the Lower Canal region. Therefore, it must be raised and thickened to prevent any eventuality. Straightening the dangerous curves will also benefit navigation and prevent scouring. The incomplete sections of the western embankment must be repaired to prevent waves from obstructing the canal during high water periods and endangering the eastern embankment. Even sections without breaches should be raised to prevent lake water from crossing the embankment. The outer slope of the western embankment, which faces the lake, already has stone protection. Stones should be added to areas without stones or with too few stones to prevent scouring. (D) The Huai River Regulation Project Should Commence Soon The problems of the Lower Canal and the disasters in the Lower Canal region this year and in the past stem from the fact that the channels for the Huai River to enter the Yangtze River have not been improved, and the channels to enter the sea have not been opened. As mentioned before, for fundamental relief, regulating the Huai River is the precursor to managing the Canal. The plans for diverting the Huai River into the Yangtze River and the sea are ready. If they can be implemented and completed soon, the problems of the Lower Canal will be solved easily, without the need for further discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Record of the Current Survey of the Liyang Eastern Dam <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Liyang Eastern Dam is the lifeline of the Taihu Lake basin. Once it breaches, the Jian and Yu rivers will flow straight down, and the southern counties will be in danger of being submerged. Recently, due to continuous rains causing disasters and the collapse of the canal embankment, the Gao and Shao areas are lamenting. The people of the southern counties are very concerned about the safety of the Eastern Dam. It is widely rumored in the Xichang area that the Eastern Dam is in danger of breaching, causing rumors to spread and people to panic. The Liyang County Government, together with the Construction Bureau and local figures, took measuring instruments to the Eastern Dam on the 7th to conduct the latest survey. The survey situation is recorded as follows, which is also what those who care about the safety of the Eastern Dam want to see.</p>
<p>▲ Location and Current Situation of the Eastern Dam The Eastern Dam is located about seventy li west of Liyang County, in Gaochun County. It used to be a place where the Yangtze River flowed through. Later, because the Taihu Lake basin suffered repeated disasters, a dam was built to cut off the river flow. It is divided into upper and lower dams, ten li apart. The Eastern Dam is its general name. Director Shi and others departed at 6:00 AM on the 7th, traveling west along the Wen River from Nandun. The embankments on both sides were submerged, leaving no trace. The victims stood naked, in great pain. Passing through the Three Pagodas and Shengping ponds, these places used to be wide and relaxed stretches of the river. After the dam was built, the flow was cut off, and the ponds also silted up. Residents competed to plant rice and wheat, gradually turning them into farmland. Only a shallow river channel remained, barely connected. Now, it is a vast expanse of water, with surging waves. We silently thought to ourselves, if we could deepen these ponds to store water, it would be a benefit for the Taihu Lake basin for generations to come. Arriving at the Lower Dam in Dingbu, Anhui, it was already 2:00 PM. The residents along the dam were bustling and showed no signs of panic. After inspecting the dam body, it was as solid as usual. We immediately walked along the middle river to the Upper Dam. The middle river is ten li long, and the fields on both sides are quite high. Early rice has matured. Looking around, the scenery is beautiful. The residents on both sides were celebrating a bumper harvest. We arrived at the Upper Dam at 3:30 PM. Prosperity was even greater than the Lower Dam. At this time, the water west of the dam was level with the top of the dam. It had once overflowed the dam, but it was not a major problem. We then inspected the dam body, which was very intact. However, a few residents had built houses on top of the dam. The wall bases and wooden piles caused the stones to crack, which was very dangerous. We immediately used a leveling instrument to measure the difference in water level between the upper and lower dams and returned.</p>
<p>▲ Measurement Results The upper dam water level differed by 2.7 meters, and the lower dam water level differed by 6.8 meters, for a total difference of 9.58 feet, or about three zhang. This shows the huge difference in water potential. If it were to breach, the disaster in the southern counties would be even greater than in Jiangbei. The water from the middle river had already flowed into the Liu Gong Bridge in the Lower Dam. A small earthen dam has been built to block it.</p>
<p>▲ Current Situation Observation According to the current situation, the Eastern Dam is absolutely safe. However, there are a few points that should be noted: (A) Building houses on top of the dam should be prohibited. Those that have already been built should be demolished to avoid artificial damage. (B) The downstream counties, such as Sucheng, Xiyi, Liyang, etc., should jointly send a commissioner to be stationed there. Since the Eastern Dam was built in Gaochun, more than 100,000 mu of farmland has been submerged. There has always been a desire to gather people to excavate. Recently, rumors have spread again, saying that special actions are scheduled. Although they are unfounded, it is also important to plan ahead to prevent any eventuality. (C) Downstream counties should jointly raise annual repair funds (The Eastern Dam originally had annual repair funds, but they have been diverted due to military affairs). As the matter concerns the interests of the entire Taihu Lake basin, they should jointly raise funds, set the custody method, and use them for annual repairs to make a major plan for the future.</p>
<p>Please handle the matter. Yesterday, we sent personnel to Xiyi to report the survey situation and discuss future measures.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Tragic Situation of the Flood Disaster in Northern Jiangxi <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang-Xunyang Railway Suspended for Half a Month</p>
<p>Relief Society Plans Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Nanchang News: Since early July, Jiujiang, Xingzi, Hukou, Pengze, Ruichang, Yongxiu, Xiushui, De'an, etc. in northern Jiangxi, as well as Poyang, Duchang, and Yugan counties near Poyang Lake, have been flooded one after another. By early August, the floodwaters had increased dramatically. Jiujiang City was several feet deep in water. The Yangtze River water level reached over forty-five feet. The Nanchang-Xunyang Railway was suspended for half a month because the floodwaters had damaged the roadbed. The water had also submerged the Saihu Yangliuqing area, resulting in losses of over 100,000 yuan. Although the floodwaters in Jiujiang have receded slightly, the retreat is very slow. The Nanchang-Xunyang Railway is now barely operating once a day (the morning express train has been suspended for over a month), but the small number of trains, the large number of passengers, and the slow travel speed have caused the passengers great suffering. According to those who came from Xunbu, the flood disaster in Jiujiang is extremely tragic. The embankments along the river have completely collapsed. Grain and livestock have been washed away. The number of collapsed houses and drowned people is countless. According to the report from the De'an Disaster Relief Committee: (A) In the first district, 3,880 households in twenty-five villages were flooded, and fifty people were drowned. The embankments of ten places, including Datang Lake, Gucun Lake, and Huying Jia Lake, were completely collapsed. The flooded paddy fields in the whole district were about 25,600 mu. 320 houses were collapsed by water in the whole district. 523 cattle and 943 pigs were drowned. (B) In the second district, 1,139 households in twelve villages were flooded, and more than forty people were drowned. More than 3,800 mu of fields and 800 mu of land were flooded. 180 houses were collapsed by water in the whole district. Seven hundred pigs and cattle were drowned. (C) In the third district, 735 households in twenty-five villages were flooded, and three people were drowned. 1,570 mu of fields were flooded. Six houses were collapsed. One hundred and thirty cattle and pigs were drowned. (D) In the fourth district, 666 households in twenty-four villages were flooded. 1,320 mu of fields were flooded. Ten houses were destroyed. More than thirty pigs and cattle were drowned. According to the Relief Committee, after the bandit disaster in the province, a flood disaster occurred again. The disaster victims are scattered across northern Jiangxi. After the flood recedes, how to resettle the millions of victims is a major problem. Other provinces have only flood disasters, but this province has bandit disasters throughout the eighty-one counties. Looking around the province, there is almost no clean land. Currently, the Relief Committee is planning the following measures: (1) Request the National Government to issue flood disaster public bonds, because after the bandit disaster in the province, the treasury is empty and there are no funds to allocate. Sporadic fundraising is useless. (2) Provide relief through work projects. Nearby refugees will repair the collapsed embankments in various places. If this cannot fully accommodate all the refugees, then build provincial and county roads. At the same time, try to supplement planting of short-term miscellaneous grains and vegetables. (3) The Water Conservancy Bureau of the Construction Department will send more technicians to various disaster areas to carry out various industrial relief efforts to promote production while providing disaster relief.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government believes that the flood disaster in this province is serious. In addition to requesting relief from the Central Government and other parties, Chairman Lu is traveling to Beijing with a flood disaster report to report the disaster situation in the province to the Central Government. The Provincial Relief Committee has allocated the remaining 90,000 yuan of relief funds to various counties for emergency relief. Public groups in the province, considering the large number of victims and the severity of the disaster, are raising funds for disaster relief. The Jiangxi Provincial Flood Disaster Relief Association, initiated by the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, held its first preparatory meeting yesterday, and decided that the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce's communications office, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Jiangxi Charity Federation would send telegrams to the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior, the Flood Relief Committee, and the Relief Committee, requesting immediate relief. Hu Youyu, Zeng Jinshan, Lu Fuchuang, Xu Ruifu and other five people were publicly elected to visit He Yingqin at the headquarters to ask for instructions on all relief measures for the flood disaster.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Hubei Relief Organizations Define Authority <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Hankou News: Wuhan has been flooded for more than a month. Although the floodwaters have gradually receded in recent days, they have receded by less than a foot. The water level is still over fifty-one feet. In the cool autumn September, the weather has changed suddenly, and millions of victims are suffering greatly. The victims in the other counties are even worse. Now, after the Civil Affairs Department has conducted another investigation and distinguished the severity of the disaster, it has designated the following disaster areas: The first-class disaster areas are Wuchang, Hanyang, Yunmeng, Xiaogan, Huangkang, Mianyang, Hanchuan, Guangji, Huangmei, Shishou, Tianmen, Jiangling, Echeng, and Jianli, for a total of fourteen counties. The second-class disaster areas are Yingcheng, Qishui, Huanggang, Yangxin, Qichun, Dazhi, Jiayu, Huangpi, Xianning, Songzi, Macheng, Jingshan, and Zhijiang, for a total of thirteen counties. The third-class disaster areas are Anlu, Gongan, Zhongxiang, Puqi, and Jingmen, for a total of five counties. The fourth-class disaster areas are Suixian, Yunxian, Dangyang, Yidu, Chongyang, Luotian, Changyang, Gucheng, Nanzhang, and Xiangyang, for a total of ten counties. There are more than 10 million victims, and the relief funds received from various parties are still very small. The Hubei branch of the National Flood Relief Committee has received 50,000 yuan from consultant Baker, 100,000 US dollars from the American Red Cross, and 3,000 Japanese yen from the Japanese Disaster Relief Sympathy Association. The Hubei Flood Disaster Relief Association has received 170,000 yuan from the Central Government, 100,000 yuan from Guangdong merchants, and 50,000 yuan from the Hankou banking industry, as well as donations from individuals, totaling less than one million yuan. After issuing 5,000 yuan to the counties with the most serious disasters, the remaining counties still feel disappointed. The Relief Branch believes that the relief funds are too small to be of much help, so it telegraphed Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance on the 9th, requesting him to quickly allocate huge funds for relief efforts. The Emergency Relief Association has also sent letters to people from other provinces in Hankou, asking them to send telegrams to their respective provinces to raise funds. There is no shortage of charitable people in the country, and hearing of the severe disaster in Hubei, they will surely be happy to contribute. As for the relief organizations, the earliest established organization is the Hubei Flood Disaster Relief Association, jointly organized by all sectors of the party, government, military, and commerce. The next is the Hubei Branch of the Flood Relief Association, jointly organized by all sectors of Chinese and foreign countries. Recently, for the convenience of handling affairs, it has been decided to divide the authority. The Hubei Branch will be responsible for the Hankou emergency relief matters, and the Emergency Relief Association and the Hubei Branch will be jointly responsible for the emergency relief in various counties. In reality, they will still maintain contact. In addition, there are also the Central Health Group's Office in Hankou, the North China Disaster Relief Association, the Northeastern Four Provinces Charitable Federation, the Universal Moral Society, the Chinese Jisheng Society, and the World Red Cross Society China Headquarters Relief Team, which jointly organized a relief team. The first team, led by Yang Zigong, chairman of the Northeastern Four Provinces Charitable Federation, departed for Xindi on the 7th. The second team, led by Du Yannian, director of the National Flood Relief Committee's office in Hubei disaster area, is scheduled to depart for Fankou on the 10th to handle emergency relief matters. It is said that Mr. Zhu Qinglan will be in charge of the labor relief projects. (September 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Hankou Headquarters to Try Wang Junjie <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Will be Sentenced for the Crime of Murdering His Superior Officer</p>
<p>And Issue an Order to Assist in the Arrest of Accomplices</p>
<p>Hankou News: He Zhenfan, the acting division commander of the 34th Division, was killed by Wang Junjie, the brigade commander of the division, in Xiantao. The Wuhan Headquarters has lured Wang to Hankou and arrested him on August 2nd. It has also organized a military tribunal, with Xu Yuanquan, the bandit suppression commissioner of the Sichuan-Hunan-Hubei border area, as the presiding judge, and Ye Peng, the chief of staff of the garrison headquarters, as the judge, to conduct the trial and determine the sentence in order to uphold the law. After the tribunal was established, Xu Yuanquan personally brought Wang Junjie, Zhao Jizhi, Yao Yingcheng, and others to trial. Later, because Xu left to suppress bandits, Judge Ye Peng continued to question them. Through various methods, the truth of the case was clarified. Wang will be sentenced for the crime of murdering his superior officer. According to the Garrison Headquarters, Ye is currently drafting the sentence, which will be announced within a few days. Among the accomplices, Hu Shufu, Li Xiuzhi, and Yuan Youlong are still at large. Yesterday, the Headquarters issued an order to all troops to assist in their arrest. The order stated: It has been ordered that Wang Junjie, the brigade commander of the 34th Division, be dismissed and taken into custody. His accomplices Hu Shufu, Li Xiuzhi, and Yuan Youlong are definitely accomplices. The acting division commander of the division, Zhang Wanxin, was secretly ordered to escort them to Hankou for trial. After the acting division commander replied, stating that he would comply with the order, the suspects had fled for fear of punishment. People have been sent out to search for them for days, but they have not been caught. In addition to ordering a strict search, we request all agencies and troops to assist in the arrest to avoid any escapees. In addition to replying by telegram and issuing separate orders, we hereby order you to comply with the order and instruct your subordinates to assist in the arrest. (September 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Zhu Shude Case: Bullet Recovered <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Zhu Shude case occurred on July 27th, over forty days have passed. The most important piece of evidence in the case, the murder bullet, remained undiscovered for a long time. It was only today (the 8th) that Wang Weijun found it, which must be considered a significant discovery. On the day of the incident, Local Court Prosecutor Li Wenzhai went to the scene for inspection that very evening. The next day, Prosecutor Liu Rongshan also went for inspection, but both failed to find the bullet's location. After the deceased was placed in a coffin, the local constable, Wang Yuan, found the bullet casing under the east window of the west room. Since then, Zhu’s younger sister, Shuxin, repeatedly stated to the court that since the bullet could not be found in the room where Zhu Shude tragically died, she would not accept the suicide theory. Prosecutor Liu Rongshan, on the 21st of last month, also brought judicial police to Wang Weijun’s house, to the room where Zhu Shude tragically died, for a detailed search. However, nothing was found on the walls or the ground. On the 27th of last month, the Local Court Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution, accusing Wang Weijun and Liu Hesheng (Wang's wife) of concealing military firearms and assisting in suicide. Zhu's younger sister, Shuxin, was still not satisfied and insisted on inspecting Wang Weijun's other rooms for traces of bullets. If a bullet could be found in another room, it would undoubtedly prove that it was a brutal murder and the body was moved. Around 10:00 AM today, the court dispatched Chief Judicial Police Officer Xi Linge, Zhu's family representative Zhu Xifang, and brought the defendant Wang Weijun from the detention center, along with four judicial police officers, to Wang's residence for another inspection. Yang Yichao, a patrol officer from the relevant Public Security Bureau, also arrived, along with Wang Weijun's father, Wang Jinghai. They all went to the south room of the west house. The room was covered in cobwebs and dust, and cluttered with various items. The bed where Zhu Shude slept had been moved out, but the writing desk and bookshelves were still in place, with books neatly arranged. Everyone carefully searched the walls and the ground. After a while, Wang Weijun went to the northwest corner of the room and called Chief Judicial Police Officer Xi Linge and Patrol Officer Yang Yichao to point out a small hole in the paper pasted on the northwest corner seam, about three fen high and two and a half fen wide, appearing to be a bullet hole. With the consent of Zhu's family representative, Zhu Xifang, Wang's coachman was asked to find an axe to further examine the area. The soil on the wall was very loose, and the bullet did not penetrate deeply, as it was blocked by a stone. The bullet was found inside. It was immediately taken out for examination. The bullet was six or seven fen high and five or six fen thick, brand new, with a flat bullet head. Based on measurements, the bullet hole was three chi three cun above the ground and penetrated one cun seven fen into the wall. According to Wang Weijun, based on the direction and height of the bullet hole, Zhu Shude must have been sitting on the bed against the west wall, using her left hand to shoot herself. The flat bullet head was due to hitting a stone inside the wall. Chief Judicial Police Officer Xi Linge said that if Zhu Shude shot herself while sitting on the bed, the mosquito net on the bed should also have bullet holes and should be found and compared. Wang Weijun said that the mosquito net was already gone. Xi Linge then called Court President Hu Ji to report. The court then sent Judge Li Hongye to investigate. During this time, everyone went to the north room (Wang Weijun's living room) to inspect. Zhu's family representative Zhu Xifang started to flip through the paintings on the wall, and Wang Weijun became furious, almost leading to a quarrel. At around 12:30 PM, Judge Li Hongye arrived, and they went to the south room of the west house for another inspection, examining the bullet closely. He instructed the judicial police that the investigation of evidence should not be made public today, and that anyone not related to the case should leave immediately. He then questioned Wang Weijun about the whereabouts of the mosquito net. Wang replied that the mosquito net was given to the local constable Wang Yuan, and the bed had been sold. The judge then ordered Wang Yuan to be summoned for questioning. Wang Yuan flatly denied it. When Wang Weijun was questioned again, he lowered his head and remained silent. The judge ordered a return to the court for further trial and called Jieqing Photography Studio by phone to take several photos of the bullet hole in the west room. At the same time, bloodstains were found on the bricks on the ground outside the west room. The judge ordered the police officers to dig up the bricks, wrap them in paper, and take them back to the court along with the bullet. At 2:30 PM, the group returned to the court by car, and Wang Weijun was taken back to the detention center for further detention. (September 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Guangdong Province Bans Refusal to Use Old Silver Coins <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Official-Business Conference Decides on Two Prohibition Measures</p>
<p>Execution of Penalties to Begin on September 15th</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The currency system of Guangdong Province originally uniformly circulated twenty-cent silver coins. However, silver merchants took the opportunity to create new and old coin distinctions to make huge profits. Government-minted silver coins naturally have chronological differences, but in terms of purity, coins minted at different times all adhere to the regulations and are no different. However, silver merchants have consistently based the value of new and old coins on their age, using new coins at face value and discounting old coins. Recently, this practice has become increasingly rampant, with old coins being discounted as low as 93 or 94 percent. Small merchants often suffer invisible losses in their transactions. They have repeatedly appealed to the authorities to find ways to maintain the value of the coins. Yesterday, the financial authorities convened representatives from various businesses to discuss methods of maintaining the currency's value. Those present at the meeting included representatives from the Silver Industry Zhongxin Hall, the Silver Industry Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Central Bank, and the Department of Finance, totaling more than ten people. The meeting concluded with a unanimous decision to strictly prohibit the discounting of old coins. The prohibition measures discussed are as follows: (1) The Department of Finance will rename the Guangdong Province Coin Appraisal Committee to the Coin Appraisal Committee, effective from September 15th. All revenue and expenditures of public and private organizations in the province shall be based on full-weight official coins, regardless of their age. Violations will be subject to the penalties outlined in Articles 9 and 10 of the appraisal regulations approved by the Department of Finance. Article 9 states that if any store refuses to accept old coins, they will be fined fifty yuan by the appraisal committee upon confirmation of the report. Article 10 states that if personnel of government tax collection agencies refuse to accept full-weight official old coins, merchants may send the rejected coins to the committee for appraisal. Upon confirmation, the committee will submit a report to the Department of Finance, which will issue orders to the respective supervisory authorities to dismiss the offending official as a warning. If it is a store, the committee may submit a report to the Department of Finance to revoke its business license and order it to close. (2) The monthly expenses of the Coin Appraisal Committee were originally shared by the Central Bank, the City Chamber of Commerce, and various businesses. The Central Bank and the City Chamber of Commerce have recently sent letters requesting to discontinue their contributions. It has now been decided that the Department of Finance will send separate letters to the Central Bank and the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to continue contributing according to the original amounts. After the above two proposals were passed, the meeting adjourned. It is reported that the Department of Finance has decided to implement the penalties on September 15th. If anyone dares to discriminate against old coins again, the Department of Finance will summon the merchant for a warning upon discovery. Subsequent offenses will be punished according to regulations, and a third violation will result in a closure order as a warning. At the same time, the Department of Finance has sent separate letters to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, ordering the police to notify them to immediately arrest and severely punish those who refuse to issue receipts for silver transactions and use this as a means to coerce and refuse to accept old coins.

<h3 id="e71">Zhejiang Province Rectifies Defense Corps in Various Counties <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>All Organizations Must Be Established Before the 20th of This Month</p>
<p>The Security Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government has formulated procedures and measures for rectifying the defense corps and eliminating bandits and communists. Recently, the department found that the organization of the defense corps in various counties was complex and the structures varied greatly. Many of the corps members were recruited from undesirable elements, resulting in a weak sense of responsibility and poor self-defense capabilities. In fact, not only were they unable to suppress bandits, but they were often exploited by them. Therefore, it was decided to rectify the defense corps, and it was proposed to change the corps members to a mix of voluntary and hired personnel. Last month, a military training program for defense corps was held, with a total of 240 trainees. They have now graduated and been assigned to various counties to provide on-site training to the defense corps in their respective counties. The provincial government has ordered that the defense corps in all counties be established before the 20th of this month so that all counties can have self-defense capabilities to assist the security teams. It is reported that Zhu Mingtao, the director of the Security Department, plans to personally visit Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua, and other counties bordering Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi in the latter half of this month to inspect the defenses and instruct the county magistrates and corps leaders on the proper measures.</p>

<p>The Whole Story of the Water Patrol Causing Trouble in a Neighboring County: Chen A'gen, a second-class water patrol officer of the Second Team of the Water Patrol Corps of Jinshan County, gathered his colleagues in plain clothes last night (the 8th) at around 11:00 PM and beat a woman named Xu Qian from Xiuye Bridge Beach. Each household, hearing the woman's cries for help in their sleep, came out to investigate. It was learned that the woman was from the Cuanlai Temple and was returning from pilgrimage to the Nihe Beach, temporarily docked here waiting for the tide. The men on the boat had gone ashore for tea, and the seven women on the boat had fallen asleep. Suddenly, two men in gray uniforms and plain clothes, holding electric lights, boarded the boat claiming to inspect it. They turned unreasonable, searched without justification, slapped faces, and kicked feet, hence the cries for help. A shop assistant first apprehended Chen Gensheng, the water patrol officer who caused the trouble, while the two men in plain clothes took the opportunity to escape. The police station of the Third Branch was notified by telegram and dispatched police to bring both parties to the county Public Security Bureau for investigation. According to Chen A'gen, he was escorting Team Leader Tan to Songjiang and was informed that there were many suspicious incense boats, so he went to search them. The woman then started shouting wildly, but he did not actually beat her. Later, Team Leader Tan went to the bureau to apologize and punished the water patrol officer with twenty lashes before taking him back to be dealt with according to the law. However, it is reported that the Public Security Bureau has transferred this case to the County Court for handling.</p>

<p>Reply to the Letter on the Date of Commencement of Business Tax Collection: After the Bureau consulted with the Chamber of Commerce and invited various industries to make separate identifications of the Wuxi business tax, the first quarter's tax silver has been remitted. Director Wang received instructions from the Department of Finance yesterday, which required that the summer tax be collected and reported by September 10, regardless of whether the households were fully identified or had outstanding balances. The amount of tax collected was to be reported in a report form and sent to the Department for verification, and preparations were to be made for the autumn tax collection as soon as possible. Director Wang immediately forwarded the letter to the Chamber of Commerce. The County Chamber of Commerce responded that the date of commencement of business tax collection was previously discussed with County Magistrate Pan and former Director Yang Wubian when they went to Zhenjiang to negotiate. The Department of Finance insisted that Zhenjiang had already recognized it and respected the Provincial Government's resolution, and the collection was commenced on April 1. The Qian industry also had Chairman Lu Xiaobo of the Chamber of Commerce take the lead in paying the first quarter's tax, considering the overall situation. The final result was that after returning to Wuxi, the Business Tax Bureau would notify various industries to pay the first quarter's tax first. When the stamp was issued, the month was not temporarily indicated, and the case would be handled in accordance with the general case after the whole province decided on the plan. The Provincial Magistrate Pan had reported the details of the negotiation to the Provincial Government on record. At present, there are still many counties in Jiangsu Province that have not decided on the business tax, and for the date of commencement of collection, since the business tax was implemented by the Chamber of Commerce in June, many people preferred to clear the fiscal year of the 19th year and start from the autumn. Considering the situation in Wuxi, the silkworm crop failed this year, followed by the flood, and the market was depressed. The business tax was actually paid in the autumn. If only one quarter was collected, and then another autumn tax had to be collected, it would be impossible to do so in fact. The above information has been replied to the Business Tax Bureau.</p>
<p>Over 280,000 Mou of Farmland Affected by the Disaster: The County Government previously received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs to investigate and report the actual situation of the disaster in the county so as to compile the information. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Chen filled out a form yesterday and reported the actual situation of the disaster in the county. The total population of the entire county was 194,793 households, or 944,544 people, and the number of farmers affected by the disaster was about 128,000. The total area of agricultural land that was completely destroyed and hopeless was 287,834 mou, 8 fen, 8 li, and 8 hao. As for those that were not submerged, judging from the current situation, if there is no wind or rain, a medium harvest can be expected. The county's crops have always been 80% rice and 20% mulberry. This time, in addition to the rice fields being flooded, many mulberry trees were also submerged. Not only are the mulberry leaves yellowed now, making it difficult to raise autumn silkworms, but also the roots of the mulberry trees have been damaged, and the spring silkworm crop next year will also be affected.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit the Performance of Southern Opera: The second party-government meeting in the county was held at the county government yesterday, chaired by County Magistrate Chen Chuande. The important cases decided are as follows: 1. The County Government proposed that the organization of people's organizations should comply with the provisions of the revised organizational plan of the people's organizations regarding the procedure. It was decided to pass it. 2. The County Executive Committee proposed that Southern Opera, which affects social morals, has long been prohibited. If there are still performances in the future, they should be strictly arrested and punished. 3. The County Supervisory Committee proposed that Tan Huang Opera, mythological martial arts novels, and mythological movies have a great impact on social morals and should be strictly prohibited by both the party and the government. The above two items were discussed together and decided as follows: A. In the future, if there are Southern Opera performances that are related to social morals, or similar Tan Huang performances, the Public Security Bureau will investigate and strictly prohibit them. Violators will be arrested and prosecuted. B. Obscene mythological martial arts novels will be investigated and strictly prohibited by the County Party Headquarters, the Education Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau. C. The screening of film films will be handled by the Education Bureau from September 15th, in accordance with the results of the review of the Central Film Review Committee and the regulations. 4. The County Supervisory Committee proposed that the party headquarters recently joined forces with various theaters to raise funds for disaster relief, and the Public Security Bureau should notify its subordinates to assist at any time. It was decided to pass it. 5. The County Supervisory Committee proposed that the construction of various theaters and entertainment venues in the future should be carefully investigated by the Construction Bureau to avoid further misfortune. It was decided to pass it. 6. The plan to reorganize the county's water conservancy has not yet been implemented. A water conservancy research association should be established to discuss and implement the plan. It was decided that the county government would investigate and quickly establish a water conservancy research association to discuss and proceed.</p>
<p>The Price of Autumn Silkworm Cocoons Is Ninety Yuan Per Load: The silk factories in the county have received relief bonds and are starting their machines to provide a livelihood for female workers. Therefore, they are renting cocoon shops and buying autumn cocoons one after another. In the past three or four days, 124 people have reported to the cocoon industry association for opening cocoons as of yesterday, and there are still more reporting. The scene is no less lively than the spring cocoon season. The early cocoon shops in the four villages have been weighed for three or four days. The market price of autumn cocoons in the past few days has been 60 to 70 yuan per load. Yesterday, the price in Beiqiao Jixiangbang and other places was released to 80 yuan. Gongtailong in Shitou, Yingyi in Chang'an Bridge, and Xingchang in Gu Ting Temple have all started weighing one after another, with a market price of 60 yuan. Yesterday, the price of each line was mutually released to 90 yuan per load, but there were few goods. The current silk market is actually losing money in the competition for cocoons. The drying loss of autumn cocoons is about 280 catties, and the reeling loss is about 580 catties.</p>

<p>Request to Postpone the Imposition of Survey Fees: Wu County was ordered to collect a survey fee of one jiao per mou. The County Party Headquarters and the district chiefs of various districts believed that this imposition exceeded the regulation of one percent of the land price, and the silkworm and wheat harvests this year were poor, and the autumn harvest was hopeless. On the 9th, they telegraphed the province to request permission to temporarily postpone the imposition in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

<p>Sheltering Refugees and Handling Relief Plans: As of 10:00 AM on the 9th, a total of 3,500 refugees have been sheltered in the county. In Gaoyou, there are still a large number of refugees, about 5,000, being transported south one after another. Mr. Ma Jing'ang, the representative of the county, reported to the Disaster Relief Federation and requested that a way be found to shelter them. The Provincial Righteous Relief Association also sent a telegram stating that the Public Security Bureau should be entrusted to find more shelters. As for the relief work, the representatives of the refugees in the Second District, Nanguang, Liu Shizong and Xu Chunyang, and others, and the representatives of the towns and villages in the Yong'an Town, Zhang Hanzhang, and others, and the towns and villages in the Seventh District, Qiaoshu, Dinggou, Dingjiahuo, Yanhuang, Shaoshui, Zhou Hantang, and others, said that the water was five or six feet deep and the relief supplies could not reach them from Shaobo. The representatives were sent to Yangzhou to set up a flood relief association and requested relief personnel to distribute the relief from Xiannv Temple, Dahan, directly to the two flood relief offices in Qiaoshu and Dinggou. On the 9th, the urgent relief association telegraphed Sun Zhongying in Tianjin, asking him to raise funds and to encourage the fundraising committee members Wang Jingting, Zhu Gan臣, Tang Ewu, and Song Shenzhi to depart from Yangzhou to Beijing and Shanghai to work hard.</p>

<p>A Large Number of Refugees Rescued and Transported to Rugao: The Rugao Reception Committee for Disaster-Stricken People Transported Along the Canal sent several civilian ships to rescue refugees in Dongtai and other places. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, 371 disaster-stricken people were transported from Dongtai and immediately sent to various disaster-stricken people's shelters. It is said that they are all from Xiyuan Xiaohai and other districts in Dongtai County. When the water level was high in those places, it reached the roofs of the houses, and at least to the chest. About 20% of those who did not escape were drowned. The reporter spoke with them, and the refugees said with tears in their eyes, "It's so tragic."</p>

<p>A Kidnapping and Robbery Occurs in Gaoganduo: At about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, six awning boats suddenly arrived at Nanganduo in the county.

<p>Recent News on Flood Relief: The Wuxing Flood Relief Committee was established last month and established branch offices in each district, and issued flood survey forms to each village and neighborhood committee, setting a deadline for detailed investigation of the disaster situation and the number of disaster victims in order to distribute relief accordingly. As for raising relief funds, wealthy gentry and merchants in Nanxun have jointly raised 50,000 yuan, half of which will be retained in Xun for self-distribution, and the remaining 25,000 yuan will be allocated to the county relief fund first. In recent days, County Magistrate Li has personally gone to the countryside with gentry and merchants who are familiar with each district to solicit donations and has reportedly raised 10,000 yuan. Together with the 30,000 yuan from the National Government, 30,000 yuan from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, 3,000 yuan from the Zhejiang Relief Association, and various donations from compatriots in Shanghai, the total has reached more than 100,000 yuan. Once the disaster survey forms from each district have been collected and calculated, the relief will be distributed immediately. The farmers in Jingshan Daitou, Xia'ang, Nan Shuanglin, and other places, who were impatient and could not wait any longer, engaged in riots. The Flood Relief Committee sent people to the countryside to persuade them and explain the recent fundraising situation and relief distribution methods of the Flood Relief Association, so that they all calmed down and nothing happened.</p>

<p>District Chief Incites Military Mutiny and Is Accused: Because the district chief of the Fourth District (Xincang) of Pinghu, Zhu Chenguang, in the sixth lunar month, under the pretext of rewarding the 16th Transport Team of the Provincial Security Team stationed in the town, raised funds from the local area, but Zhu privately deducted half of the funds. When the garrison learned about it, it incited a military mutiny, causing harm to the local area. Zhu was the real culprit and was accused of it to the Department of Civil Affairs. It is reported that the Department of Civil Affairs has instructed the county government to thoroughly investigate. After receiving the order, the county government ordered the district chief of the First District, Chen Kai, and the roving assistant Shen Canru to investigate and verify.</p>
<p>Bee Incident: Farmers Demand Compensation: After the farmers requested the county government to move out of the Han Family Temple East Italian Bee Farm, the turmoil subsided. Recently, it has been reported that the farmers have suffered considerable losses due to the bee damage to the crops and have to demand compensation in order to maintain their livelihood. On the 8th, they properly discussed the method with the farmers' association and requested assistance from the County Party Headquarters and petitioned the county government for compensation. However, the bee farm believes that bees are beneficial and harmless to rice and is unwilling to suffer this fate. In addition to the Zhejiang Beekeeping Association's negotiation with the county government, it also issued a declaration, saying that:</p>

<p>Yao City's One Night of False Alarm: Rumors suddenly spread in Yao City last night that bandits were going to rob money houses. For a time, the people of Yao City were all panicked. The Second Battalion Headquarters of the Security Team and the Public Security Bureau declared martial law that night and sent police to patrol the city gates. Fortunately, nothing happened until dawn. It is said that there are two reasons for the origin of the rumors. One is that the Heyuan Money House in the city had a dispute with a customer over interest, causing a big conflict. The money house then sent a telegram to the military and police to report it and asked them to arrest people. The second is that the members of the leather workers' association caused a dispute because of the collection of membership fees. Later, the trade union reported to the military and police agencies that there were reactionaries. At about 6:00 PM that afternoon, armed military police arrested a bag craftsman at the Shuimenkou and two others in front of the Shao Family Garden, which led to the spread of rumors that bandits were robbing, causing the people of Yao City to suffer a night of false alarm.</p>

<p>Educational Funding Relief Measures for Various Counties: The Provincial Education Department presented the educational funding relief measures for various counties in Anhui Province affected by the floods at the Provincial Government's regular meeting on the 4th.

<h3 id="e85">Letter from the Langxi Flood Relief Association <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Having recently read the section on domestic news in your esteemed newspaper on the 25th, concerning the disaster assessment in Anhui Province, we find it inconsistent with the facts. According to our information, no disaster assessment personnel from Anhui, such as Hong Huichen and Chen Zhiding, visited Langxi to conduct an assessment. Instead, they made an arbitrary judgment based on the assumption that the disaster situation was relatively mild, which is greatly mistaken. Langxi is located downstream of Guangde and upstream of Wuhu. This year's flood was not only large but also sudden, caused by the backflow of the Yangtze River. The embanked fields were completely destroyed, and no seeds or grains remain. The disaster situation is extremely severe, unprecedented in history. Rice, grain, goods, houses, and livestock were all swept away. Tens of thousands of disaster victims are without clothing, food, or homes, standing and lying in the wind and rain for more than ten days and nights. To this day, the water has not receded, and deaths are piling up, beyond description. Previously, our association devised methods to provide relief, and the emergency relief office publicly appointed representatives to go to various places to seek aid for relief. Now, upon reading the aforementioned statement, we are extremely worried. In addition to sending telegrams to various relief agencies to clarify that the situation is not relatively mild and requesting the assessment personnel to come to Langxi for a personal assessment, we respectfully request the chief editor to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section for correction, and we will be most grateful. Publicly declared by Zhu Tingliao and others, Chairmen of the Langxi County Flood Relief Association, Anhui, September 4th.</p>

<p>Certain Central Committee Members and the Central Daily News Advocate for It</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th – Local newspapers here have long reported that the National Games will be postponed to focus on disaster relief. However, the organizing committee has repeatedly corrected this. Today, the Central Daily News editorial on the issue of postponing the National Games concluded that matters have different scales of importance and urgency, and times have priorities and delays. Now, the disaster area has reached 16 provinces, and the number of disaster victims has reached 50 million. Comparing this with the National Games, what is the scale of importance and urgency? Since the newspaper represents the Central Government, the idea of postponing the National Games temporarily gains traction.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th – Central Telegram – The organizing committee has already denied the postponement of the National Games via public telegram. According to a certain Central Committee member, the flood is severe, and the National Government has explicitly ordered the cessation of all non-essential construction to concentrate financial resources on responding to the tragic disaster.</p>
<p>The National Games and its construction are certainly not as urgent as the life-and-death issue of millions of disaster victims. It is proposed to request the Central Government to postpone the event, stop all construction, and transfer funds for disaster relief. It is hoped that the sports community will consider the disaster victims and not insist on not postponing the event.</p>

<p>Chinese Swimmer Huang Zhenxing's Ball-Throwing Skills Stand Out</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong-Tianjin Triangular Swimming Competition was held at the French Chamber of Commerce swimming pool last night at 9:15 PM. The pool is grand in scale and luxuriously decorated, unparalleled in Shanghai. That evening, the five-colored electric lights illuminated the pool, and the shimmering silver waves were picturesque. The music was loud and lively, enhancing people's interest. It was both pleasing to the eye and delightful to the ear. More than 700 men and women spectators felt as if they were in a crystal palace, happy and forgetting to return home. Chinese guests accounted for 40-50% of the audience. Mr. Shen Siliang, Honorary Director of the Association, was also invited as a distinguished guest. There were not many inter-port competition events. Since they were divided into three days, various performance programs were interspersed to provide variety. The performance results were all omitted. The competition ended at 12:00 AM.</p>

<p>Huang Zhenxing, a famous Chinese swimmer and the only middle-level athlete among the three teams from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tianjin, displayed excellent posture and strength in the water polo throw last night, surpassing all three teams. He threw three times in succession. The first throw was 66 feet 11 inches, the second throw was 70 feet 1 inch, and the third throw was 69 feet 6 inches. Every time he appeared, Chinese and Western guests in the audience applauded to welcome him. His amazing skill was such that he took the lead and stood out from the crowd. The people of Hong Kong were ecstatic, and the Chinese spectators were radiant.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Shanghai Team Scores the Most Points <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>As a result of the first day, Shanghai had 15 points, Hong Kong had 10 points, and Tianjin had 5 points. Shanghai's strength lay in the 100-yard breaststroke event, accounting for 8 points. Hong Kong was able to rank second, thanks to Huang Zhenxing's contribution.</p>

<p>In the three events, the 100-yard breaststroke was 80.2 seconds, a new Shanghai record, created by Shanghai's Hedges Ding. The water polo match was very interesting. The program was Shanghai vs. Tianjin, with seven players on each side, and each half lasting seven minutes with a three-minute break in between. Tianjin won the first goal due to an error by a Shanghai defender who threw the ball into the hands of the enemy, Hua Tian, resulting in the goal. Shanghai's Fabin scored two consecutive goals, taking the lead 2-1 in the first half. In the second half, Shanghai was very energetic and did not lose any ground. In addition, Tianjin's goalkeeper's skills were not as good as Shanghai's, resulting in consecutive goals. Sinclair scored two goals, and Bo Shangtuo scored one goal. As a result, Shanghai won 5-1.</p>

Since this is a matter of charity and a duty not to be shirked, it has been decided to approve the request. Therefore, all competitions originally scheduled for the 13th are postponed. In addition to the notice, this important announcement is hereby made.</p>
<h3 id="e106">No Football Match in Next Year's International Games <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>International Football Association Cables Reasons</p>
<p>China's Dispatch of a Football Team Will Be Just a Pipe Dream</p>
<p>Conflict in the Definition of Amateur Sports</p>
<p>The All-China Sports Federation intended to send a Chinese football team to participate in next year's World Games. However, since the published schedule of the World Games did not include a football competition, the Federation telegraphed the International Football Association in Amsterdam to inquire. Recently, a letter was received from Mr. He Qimen, honorary secretary of the Association, stating the following reasons, stating that the British-style football championship will be removed from the World Games to be held in the United States next year. The American Football Association had resolved at the Helson-Fas Conference in 1927 that if the World Games recognized the definition of amateur sports established by the Association, then football would be included in the World Games program. The two associations subsequently agreed, and the event was included in the 1928 World Games. The 1930 World Games conference in Berlin revised the definition of amateur sports. The International Football Association conference (1930) in Budapest and 1931 in Berlin, however, insisted on the Association's original definition. Since the two parties could not agree, it was decided not to include the international football competition in next year's World Games program.</p>
<p>(Note) Members of the International Football Association must be governed by the Association. The World Games cannot hold international football competitions on its own without the Association's permission.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Extremely Happy and Excited: Chizhi Overcomes Xiqing <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>33 to 28</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Basketball, Act III</p>
<p>Military Academy Greatly Defeats the Iron Team</p>
<p>The Basketball Hall was filled with people again last night. Disaster Relief Basketball, Act III, began at 7:30 PM. The Central Military Academy first defeated the Iron Team with a score of 30 to 14. Then, Chizhi overcame Xiqing with a score of 33 to 28. Chizhi had been defeated by Xiqing, and last night they indeed got their revenge. The audience was extremely happy and excited, so much so that in the last five minutes, the shouting was excessive, but fortunately, it did not cause chaos. It is hoped that the audience will correct this.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Military Academy Defeats the Iron Team <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Military Academy took an early lead in the first half with a score of 14 to 6 over the Iron Team. The Li and Huang forwards scored successively, and the Iron Team was helpless, eventually softening with a score of 30 to 14. The referee was Lu Zhongen.</p>

<p>In the Chizhi-Xiqing match, Chizhi was determined to retaliate, while Xiqing was also eager to maintain its undefeated honor. Therefore, both sides fought to the death, and the offense and defense were fierce. In the last eight minutes, Chizhi scored five consecutive points, exceeding the score, and thus defeated the enemy with a score of 33 to 28. The referee was Shao Ji.</p>
<p>According to the Association's report last night, a total of 729 tickets were sold, so there must have been 750-60 people in the basketball hall.</p>
<p>▲Inseparable: Both teams used individual defense, one following the other, inseparable, and extremely strict. It was difficult for both sides to enter and attack, and there was no way through. It took several minutes to find a gap and enter. The Xiqing three forwards were useless.</p>
<p>▲Difficult to Distinguish High and Low: Therefore, the closeness of the scores of the two teams was rare. They were only one or two points apart. Smith took the opportunity to score two points from a distance to open the scoring. In the first half, Xiqing won by one point, 14 to 13. At the beginning of the second half, the Xiqing formation loosened, so Chizhi took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack.</p>
<p>▲Wild Shouts Finally Lead to Victory: After Yang, the center, scored four consecutive points in one fell swoop, Chizhi suddenly exceeded with a score of 22 to 6. Yang and Qian succeeded one after another, still holding an advantage of 26 to 20. Xiqing chased to a tie of 26. However, in the last five minutes, Yang and Qian relied on their flying skills and added seven points, thus overcoming the once powerful Xiqing team with a score of 33 to 28. The audience shouted wildly.</p>

<p>The Experimental Primary School attached to Shanghai Middle School of Jiangsu Province, located on Shangwen Road in this city, recently noted that the diplomatic situation is dangerous, the Wan Baoshan case has not yet been resolved, and the Nakamura incident is very serious. The Japanese side intends to provoke trouble, making it difficult for the Chinese people to cope. Instead of just teaching students to sing songs of revenge, it would be better to teach them about Japan, about the Northeast, and why Japan is invading the Northeast. Therefore, the school has decided to donate its self-edited "Readings on Japanese Studies" and "Readings on Manchurian Studies" to primary schools across the country for teaching reference. However, due to the limited number of books available, each school is limited to one copy and must include one cent of postage to receive it.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Zhejiang Provincial Government Negotiates with Yongshun Steamship Company <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Small Steamer Damages Embankment</p>
<p>Yongan Steamer Seized</p>
<p>Heavy Fine to Repair Dams</p>
<p>Inland river steamers, after the water receded slightly in the latter half of last month, resumed operations one after another. However, after a major flood occurred in Shaoyang, the steamers on the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou-Kunshan routes were transferred to northern Jiangsu to transport refugees and were suspended again. In Shanghai, the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Suzhou, and Shanghai-Lake Tai routes could still operate normally. Unexpectedly, heavy rain resumed on the fifth of this month, lasting for three days and nights. The water that had receded in the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang rose again. The small steamers that had resumed operations were forced to stop due to the rising water. The Yongshun Steamship Company on the Shanghai-Lake Tai route violated the order and sailed, causing the embankment to be damaged. They were fined a huge sum of one hundred and twenty thousand yuan to be used for repairing the dams. This matter has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, reporters thoroughly investigated the situation from all sides. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Lake Tai Water Rises, Navigation Restricted: There are a total of six Shanghai-Huzhou steamers, which resumed operations in the latter half of last month, divided into morning and evening shifts. From the fifth of this month, heavy rain fell continuously for three days. The water level in Huzhou rose sharply, increasing by one foot and several inches. Huzhou has three large embankments, containing tens of thousands of acres of fields. Villagers, fearing that the embankments would be damaged by the water, prevented the steamers from sailing, and the county government also issued a notice prohibiting steamers from operating, in order to protect the embankments and avoid collapses and the flooding of farmland. The Farmers' Association also sent personnel to patrol and protect the area. All of the Shanghai-Lake Tai steamers stopped running after the fifth.</p>
<p>▲ Yongan Steamer Damages Embankment: One steamer was named Yongxin, and the other Yongan. They have great horsepower and are relatively fast. When the county government issued the ban on navigation, the company had not yet received the notice. Therefore, the Yongan steamer still departed from Shanghai. At that time, the water had risen sharply, and the waves generated by the ship were powerful, inevitably causing some damage to the embankment, loosening the soil. River water leaked into the farmland, and a section of the embankment was washed away by the water, causing an accident.</p>
<p>▲ Farmers' Association Requests Seizure of Steamer: After this incident occurred, the Huzhou Farmers' Association, on the grounds that Yongshun had violated the county government's ban and sailed during the flood, damaging the embankment and flooding farmland, reported the matter to both the county and provincial party departments, requesting the Zhejiang Provincial Government to severely punish the case and detain the company's steamer. The provincial government decided to approve the request and ordered the Huzhou County Government to first detain the Yongan steamer in Huzhou, prohibit it from operating, and prohibit the company's other steamers from sailing.</p>
<p>▲ Provincial Government Discusses Heavy Fine: The Zhejiang Provincial Government, after receiving the report, considered the commercial steamer's violation of the ban and the damage to the embankment during the flood to be a serious matter, different from accidental damage. It was brought up for discussion at the provincial affairs meeting. It was publicly decided that since the company's steamer had damaged the embankment, it should be ordered to repair it. After estimation, it was decided to fine the Yongshun Steamship Company 1.2 million yuan to be used for repairing the dams. The company will not be allowed to resume operations until the fine is paid, and the seized steamer will not be released.</p>
<p>▲ Steamship Company Tries to Intervene: The Yongshun Steamship Company has ordered the Yongxin steamer to also stop in Shanghai and not dare to sail. Meanwhile, it is trying to intervene from all sides, hoping to cancel the fine. However, the provincial government firmly refused. Later, Yongshun planned to abandon the Huzhou route and switch to the Shanghai-Xun route, but the Zhejiang Provincial Government also refused. This matter is currently being negotiated between the two parties, and it is not known how it will be resolved.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai-Lake Tai Steamers All Stop: After this incident occurred, the Huzhou County Government has set up water level gauges in the nearby waterways. Small steamers will only be allowed to pass when the water level has dropped by one foot and two inches from the current level. Therefore, all Shanghai-Lake Tai steamers, such as those of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Yuantong Company, have all stopped running.</p>

<p>City Boy Scouts to Collect Donations Along the Way Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Boy Scout Flood Relief Donation Committee has decided to hold a city-wide Boy Scout disaster relief donation along the way tomorrow (the 12th). It has been approved by various party and government agencies. Thirty-two troops have joined, with approximately 2,000 Boy Scouts. They will all start collecting donations at their designated locations tomorrow morning at 6:00 a.m. and return to their troops at 2:00 a.m. It is reported that when collecting donations, the donations will be personally deposited by the donors into the donation box, and the Boy Scouts will give a commemorative card. White cards are for donations of two jiao or more, and yellow cards are for donations of one yuan or more. All troops of Boy Scouts plan to enter hotels, amusement parks, teahouses, restaurants, and other commercial places within their designated areas to collect donations. All expenses incurred by the Boy Scouts throughout the day will be borne by the Boy Scouts themselves. In order to facilitate the command of the city-wide Boy Scout donation, the office has borrowed the Moore Memorial Church on Sima Road (Nanjing Road) to facilitate the Boy Scouts' contact with all matters at any time. The donations collected must be submitted to the donation committee at that time. It is also scheduled to invite party and government agencies to the Moore Memorial Church on the morning of the 13th to supervise the opening of the funds.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Centralized Disaster Victim Shelter <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since the city's disaster victim shelter concentrated the disaster victims in the Chao Huishan Village behind the South Railway Station on Xiebopo Road on the 8th, the food distribution method has been changed. The various situations of the past two days are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Managing Meals: The shelter's office found it very difficult to manage meals when they were scattered in nine different locations. Therefore, they adopted the method of issuing steamed buns and cash. Since the centralization, they have hired people to manage meals, providing three meals a day like ordinary families. Each person is issued two bowls for use. However, the rice and vegetables are currently cooked separately, which is very cumbersome. It is rumored that they will adopt the method of pre-cooked rice and vegetables sold in the market in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Issuing Clothing and Bedding: The clothing and bedding that have been prepared include 1,000 sets of short shirts and pants, 800 quilts, 1,000 mats, 1,000 sets of cotton clothing, and 1,000 towels and soaps. It is planned to first issue each person a set of single clothing, a towel, and a soap within the day. Quilts and mats will also be issued in order. Because more and more disaster victims from northern Jiangsu have been arriving in Shanghai recently, it has been decided to add 500 sets of each type of clothing and bedding. The clothing donated from other sources will be issued after disinfection.</p>
<p>▲ Continuing Arrival of Disaster Victims: The arrival of disaster victims from Wuhan seems to have stopped. Therefore, the disaster victims who have continued to arrive in the past two days have all come from Shaobo, Gaoyou, and other places. It is estimated that more than 400 disaster victims arrived from Shaobo and Gaoyou at around 9 p.m. the night before last. Those who arrived yesterday morning included more than 100 people from Xinghua who landed at the Dada Wharf in the southern part of the city and more than 100 people from Gaoyou who arrived at the North Station by the Jinghu train. In total, more than 600 people arrived in the two days. After registration, they were all issued symbols. Because Chao Huishan Village could no longer accommodate them, they were housed in the Yongxi Hall in Xieqiao, the second shelter.</p>
<p>▲ Medical Statistics: Yesterday, Dr. Zhang Qunying of Shanghai Hospital announced that from August 30 to September 8, there were seven temporary clinics, 207 cases of dysentery, 72 cases of colds, 33 cases of enteritis, 136 cases of malaria, 21 cases of boils, 114 cases of enterocattarrh, 1 postpartum woman, 1 pregnant woman, 1 case of true cholera, and 1 death. In total, 717 people were treated in ten days, and five people (adults and children) died.</p>

<p>▲ Mass Fundraising Conference: Yesterday, Mayor Zhang and others invited representatives of various trade associations in Shanghai to a dinner at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to discuss holding a fundraising conference. Representatives of more than 100 groups attended, with hundreds of people attending, and the atmosphere of enthusiastic disaster relief filled the venue for a while. The representatives of various trades all stated that this unprecedented flood was not only related to the survival of the country but also had a great impact on various industrial and commercial undertakings. They unanimously advocated convening meetings separately, starting to organize fundraising teams, and doing their best to raise funds for disaster relief, in order to achieve the goal of self-rescue and saving the country. During the dinner, Zhu Ziqiao reported on the disaster situation in the disaster area. Mayor Zhang and industry leaders Wu Zihao, Zhang Zilian, and Yin Jiefu all gave heartfelt speeches. Excerpts are as follows: Zhu Ziqiao reported, roughly saying, "Brothers, the disaster situation is particularly serious in Hankou, Gaoyou, and Shaobo. I personally took a plane to inspect the area. From the plane, I only saw the Yangtze River for thousands of miles, a vast expanse of water, with no trace of the banks. The treetops and rooftops floated on the surface of the water, as sparse as morning stars. Residents in the houses, the old and the weak, were all in the flood. Those who were fortunate enough to survive only escaped with their bare lives. In the places where disaster victims gathered, the sounds of crying for fathers, mothers, children, brothers, and sisters were heard from time to time. The situation was so tragic that it was heartbreaking. Passing through the Dongtai Taiyu area, there was nowhere that was not a watery country, and the number of deaths was countless. Therefore, we must do our best for emergency flood relief and must also dredge the Huai River, dredge the Yangtze River, and build embankments to prevent future disasters. Both symptomatic and fundamental treatments should be considered. I am willing to sacrifice everything and do my best from beginning to end. I hope that people from all walks of life will rise up and support me." Mayor Zhang said, roughly, "There are three essential elements for establishing a country: governance, food, land, and people. The lack of any one of these means that the country cannot be established. This time, the floods in various provinces, the land is submerged, and the people are suffering. Two of the three major elements have been harmed, which is a great loss to the country. The people of the whole country should unite their strength and go to the rescue together. During the European War, Germany had a slogan called 'National Mobilization,' which ordered the people of the whole country to defend the country. I think that this flood also requires the slogan of total mobilization and the power of total mobilization to save the great disaster," etc. Wu Zihao said, roughly, "Although various industries have successively risen to help with relief through business operations, it has not yet been universally implemented. Various industries must unite and work together and not lag behind others. This time, the clothing industry, regardless of labor and management, is willing to do its best for disaster relief. A few days ago, because we were acting on behalf of the State Council's Flood Relief Committee in handling 300,000 sets of cotton clothing, with the consent of both labor and management, the wage price was specially reduced. Each set was 1 jiao and 9 fen cheaper, for a total price reduction of 57,000 yuan," etc. Yin Jiefu reported, roughly, "Our clothing industry, in the name of the industry's trade union, has been soliciting donations from various trades and has decided that for seven days, 10% of the sales income of all trade stores in the city will be donated to disaster relief. As for the wholesale and forwarding stores, we have also done our best to solicit donations and have decided that each store will donate as much old cotton clothing printed in the current season as possible," Zhang Zilian said, roughly, "After the great floods in various provinces, the whole country has gathered its strength and is working hard to donate funds and handle emergency relief to save the affected compatriots. Now a large number of disaster victims have been rescued and transported to Shanghai, where the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has set up shelters to house them. Therefore, we compatriots who are fortunate enough not to have suffered should think about the disaster victims who have entered the shelters and not let the story of disaster victims crossing the border to eat big households repeat itself. Except for the old and weak, we must ensure that the strong have something to do and can support themselves. I am now willing to accept 100 disaster victims and house them in the various factories I run, train them, and let them work. If each factory can do this consistently, then it is also a smaller-scale work-for-relief method."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Zhang Zhijiang Telegraphed the Relief Situation in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang telegraphed to report that the disaster relief personnel in northern Jiangsu witnessed the disaster situation, saying that recently, the relief team, carrying relief supplies, set off by boat from Yangzhou to the disaster area and distributed them along the way. However, because the current was rapid at Liuzha, it was difficult for the small boat to move forward. When it reached Xiannv Temple, it hired more than a dozen civilian boats and towed them by boat to Kongjia Han and Maqiao. The water depth in each village was four or five feet, and the residents avoided climbing the high mounds, extending their necks to wait for rescue, which was unbearable to witness. The disaster situation in Gaofengqiao, Jijiayu Town, and other places was even more serious. About 2,000 disaster victims were gathered on the high mounds, and the houses and fields in the Qiaoyu Town Yangjia Village area were a vast expanse of water. About 5,000 to 6,000 disaster victims gathered on the high mounds and embankments or climbed on rooftops and branches to wait for rescue. About 4,000 disaster victims in Shefeng Embankment had gone without food for two or three days, and floating corpses were visible everywhere. After the relief supplies were distributed, the original boats were used to rescue the disaster victims who came to seek help. On the days of frugality, small boats and civilian boats transported relief personnel and drove to Shaobo Town, passing through Xinhiekou and Diaojiawan. The floodwater had receded, but the houses and houses were gone. Thousands of disaster victims were exposed to the wind and dew, and the situation was extremely miserable. The breach at Liuzha East was about 13 or 14 feet, and the water flowed inward in both places. Xinghua, Dongtai, and Qin counties in the lower reaches of the canal were all turned into swamps. The north and south breaches of Zongmaoshu Dawang Temple north of Liuzha were about four or five feet. The breach in the Shaobo earth dam washed away the lower dam, and the houses and fields were all submerged. Hundreds of disaster victims will be transported to Yangzhou and put into shelters. The relief workers reported that the Zhaoguan Dam on the Shaobo Canal bank had a breach of dozens of feet. The disaster victims were seen on the boat climbing on the branches, extending their necks to wait for rescue. The food they carried was distributed around, and the roofs of the houses in each town were completely submerged. An uncountable number of people drowned. After the wheat supplies were exhausted, they rushed back to transport food and coffins to save the living and the dead, etc. Sincerely reported, Zhang Zhijiang bowed.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Jiangsu Flood Relief Association News <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Yangzhou Office Reported on Work:</p>
<p>A letter from Cao Songqiao and Yuan Xiaogu of the Yangzhou office of the association states that the work there is extremely tense. Since its establishment, Cao Hengru has transported rice to Huo Jiaqiao to distribute among dozens of villages, and Lu Shouchang has distributed supplies along the border of Taixian County. Yue Shen (Cao Songqiao) and Yan Jiyu, Liu Jifu, Wang Mubo, and others personally distributed supplies in the Shaobo area (a total of 48 villages and 80-90 settlements were supplied). Zhou Liangji went to Zaixing Village to supervise the construction of embankments, with funds allocated by the office. Ji Mei (Yuan Xiaogu) worked with Xu Houru, He Yengeng, Tang Zifeng, Ling Yaozeng, Huang Guoxiang, Ruan Yunzhong, Zhu Zhusun, Xu Tingsong, Yang Shengwu, Yang Jianong, Wang Liquan, Ding Xiaojiang, and others, some responsible for reception, some for investigation, some for liaison with various parties, and others divided into accounting, documentation, translation, and general affairs. They rise as early as 6 AM and retire as late as 1-2 AM every day. This matter is of great importance, with millions of disaster victims. The funds for reception, such as purchasing reed mats, preparing relief goods, and transportation, are enormous and all necessary, and not a single penny is spent recklessly. The association has only provided 25,000 yuan and 1,000 bags of flour, which is far from sufficient. Further assistance is earnestly requested. Initially, it was planned to focus on Jiangdu County, but after inspection, Jiangdu and Gaoyou counties have nearly one million people awaiting relief. Witnessing the urgency of the situation, it is impossible to stand idly by, so sometimes the scope of work is inevitably exceeded. Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, with no boundaries to divide, and there is no need to be restricted by county lines. As for urgent relief in Yangzhou, the county has repeatedly sent telegrams urging action, but the situation in Gaoyou cannot be delayed. Being unable to handle both simultaneously, it is hoped that other local gentry can be hired to take charge.</p>
<p>() The Xinghua Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai Appeals:</p>
<p>A letter was sent yesterday by the Xinghua Fellow-Provincials Association to the Xinghua community. It stated that the county has suffered from repeated famines and has not yet recovered. The great floods of the Republic Year 10 were followed by droughts and salinization in the 17th and 18th years. This year, in May, there were ten days of continuous heavy rain, and before the Huai River disaster occurred, the ditches were already full. When the three dams were opened simultaneously, the water depth on the plains reached ten feet. The farmers' year of hard work was entirely swept away. Furthermore, the water from the breach of the Gao-Shao dike and the three lakes flowed down the river, treating it as a ditch. When the water arrived, the people of Xinghua were still dreaming. Accompanied by fierce winds and torrential rain, the sound of crying shook the sky. The young and strong climbed trees and roofs, while the old and weak drifted with the current. Floating corpses were everywhere, and the floodwaters raged. As a result, Xinghua County, spanning over a hundred miles, was without a single piece of dry land. The county seat, the highest point, was half submerged, and countless houses outside the city were washed away. The breach has not been blocked to this day, and the water level continues to rise, day after day, month after month, threatening to submerge even this isolated city. The most tragic disaster this time is in Gaoyou and Shaobo, followed by Yancheng, Funing, Taidong, and Xinghua. Among the five counties of Yancheng, Xinghua is the most severely affected. Gaoyou and Xinghua share contiguous land, and Xinghua has the lowest terrain, receiving the earliest impact of the water. The ports to the sea have been blocked by wealthy merchants and reclamation companies, preventing drainage. Therefore, the water in Gaoyou and Shaobo may recede at times, but the water in Xinghua has no hope of drying up, and there is no time for cultivation. Those who have lost their homes and properties, it is clear, will either die from the water today or starve to death next year. Either they will die from waiting helplessly, or they will die from taking risks. The great disasters of the future are unimaginable. Your association is concerned about the suffering of the hungry and drowning. It is hoped that you will alleviate their suffering as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲ Sending Personnel to Purchase Cotton Clothing:</p>
<p>The association believes that the weather is gradually cooling, and the disaster victims in various places lack clothing and bedding, fearing death from freezing. In addition to local procurement, advertisements were placed to solicit donations. In recent days, donations have been pouring in. Due to the widespread disaster and large population, it is still feared that it will be insufficient. Yesterday, staff member Wu Zhigang was sent to Suzhou to purchase supplies. It is heard that the association plans to pre-purchase 30,000 to 50,000 sets of cotton clothing and 10,000 to 20,000 quilts for distribution.</p>
<p>▲ Relief Worker Departs Despite Illness:</p>
<p>Qiao Baoyuan, the head of the Copper Mountain Emergency Relief effort for the association, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday despite his illness to discuss Copper Mountain affairs. The standing committee members, recognizing the heavy workload of the association and the difficulty for Director Cheng Jingsheng to leave the town for long, requested Qiao to return to town as a representative, while Cheng would stay in town to handle affairs, so as not to cause any delays. Qiao returned to town by train yesterday morning. The Copper Mountain Emergency Relief effort has already been initiated by Qiao's friend, Qiu Jinzhang, who was invited to conduct inspections. Director Qiao may need to visit for inspection after his health recovers.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Telegram Requesting the Opening of Salt Reclamation Dike <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Provincial Government on the 9th, addressed to the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Ye, and the Director of the Department of Construction, Sun. The telegram stated: We have received a telegram from the Zhenjiang-based Aftermath Relief Association for the Flood Disaster in Funing, Taidong, and Xinghua. It stated: According to a report from Shen Linsen, a refugee from Dongtai County, the east and west sides of the Dongtai Fan Dike are leaking, rendering it ineffective. The people of Dongtai claim that the disaster is due to companies such as Dafeng and Yuhua defying the provincial government's order to open up the ports to the sea. Now, the North-South, Middle, Mao-You Rivers, and Zi-Wu Rivers are nominally open, but in reality, they are blocked as before. For example, the lower reaches of the Xiaoyang River, newly dredged this year by Mr. Zhu Zhongjian of the Relief Association, are blocked by the Xiangfeng district, so that hundreds of miles of the old channel to the sea are surrounded by long dikes. This is the reason why this year's great flood has stagnated in the Yancheng, Funing, Taixing counties, making it difficult to drain. The director of the Dongtai County Public Security Bureau was ordered to open it, but it was blocked immediately after opening. It is unknown what role is being played in this. It seems necessary to appeal to your council to forward the request to the authorities and ask Zhang, the Pacification Commissioner, to personally supervise the opening of the long dike held by the company. Otherwise, not only will the massive amount of water in the lower counties be difficult to recede, but also Henan, Shandong, Anhui and Jiangsu will also be affected. In addition to having telegraphed the Jiangsu Construction Department in winter, please advocate for a consistent approach to save the disaster-stricken people. Upon reviewing the recent reports, it seems that the dredging of the waterway to the sea in the Dongtai area has been strictly enforced by your council, and a telegram has been sent to Pacification Commissioner Zhang to dispatch troops to Dongtai to suppress the situation. The eagerness to address the disaster and benefit the disaster victims is deeply appreciated. After discussion, it was decided that more than half of the disaster victims are in the five lower counties. If the accumulated water can be drained as soon as possible, not only will the displaced people be able to return to their homes and cultivate the land as soon as possible, but they can also plant wheat. This is indeed the fundamental plan for the current situation, which is more important than raising funds for relief. The companies are only concerned with protecting the small number of cotton fields within their dikes that have not been flooded. They are trying to deceive by citing the livelihoods of tenant farmers. Recently, the Huainan Salt Reclamation Association has come forward to argue by telegram, which is completely disregarding the overall situation. We believe that all belong to the same local area, and there should be no division in disaster relief and caring for the people. However, after careful consideration of the facts, weighing the priorities, how can we ignore this? Even if the livelihoods of a small number of reclamation farmers are slightly affected, other relief should be arranged separately. We cannot refrain from eating for fear of choking. We still hope that you will decisively and independently take charge and order the companies to dismantle all the dikes that obstruct the water from entering the sea, so as to facilitate drainage. Then the flood can be controlled, and the displaced people will have hope of survival. We respectfully submit this appeal with the utmost urgency. The Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow-Provincials Association kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Investigation Report on Rush To Repair the Embankment Breach <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>People from various counties in the lower reaches of the river, which were flooded, gathered at Wu's residence on Xinzha Road yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM for an emergency meeting to discuss ways to urgently rescue their hometowns and to invite Mr. Shen Zhuowu to attend and report on the situation. Before Shen spoke, Chen Qintuan stood up and said that the counties of Gaoyou, Xinghua, Dongtai, Jiangdu, and Taixian had all become watery realms after the Yun Dike broke. The water had reached the rooftops. Requests were made to rush to repair the breach, but to no avail. The responsible personnel openly stated that there would be no action until the water receded. How could the compatriots in the counties floating on the water wait? Taking Xinghua County as an example, there were more than 500,000 people floating on the water waiting for rescue, in an extremely tragic situation. If they waited for the water to recede before repairing the breach, the flooded people would inevitably die completely. What a terrible event this would be! Now, Mr. Shen has acted bravely and is trying to find a way to rush to repair the breach. He asked all the fellow villagers to pay their respects and invited Mr. Shen to report on the situation. Shen Zhuowu reported that the damage caused by the breach of the Yun Dike in the lower counties was a complete loss for the entire Chinese nation. At the time of the breach, the priority was to rescue lives. At the same time, we must</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>We should also focus on rushing to repair the breach, otherwise the water flow will not stop, and the disaster area will inevitably expand. It is especially important to understand the words of the sages: "A major flood in the lower reaches in one year means that there will inevitably be a major drought in the upper reaches for three years." Therefore, rushing to repair the breach is not only to save the lives of the people in the lower reaches, but also to prevent drought in the upper reaches. After the breach, I risked going to Shaobo to inspect and found that the work to repair the Black Fish Pond breach was quite slow, and the effectiveness was uncertain. Labor and money were wasted, and time was wasted, causing trouble. I was extremely worried. Why not change the method slightly? I heard from the river workers that there were quite a few people with knowledge, but due to the difficult environment, it was difficult to take action. I was heartbroken when I witnessed this and could not bear to sit idly by. The fellow villagers from various counties knew that I had knowledge of the new method of repairing breaches at the Gongjia Dam on the Yellow River, which was effective, and urged me to ask the provincial authorities to use the easier method to rush to repair the breach in order to save lives. I met Chairman Ye, but before I could speak, Chairman Ye blurted out first, asking if there was any method to repair the breach and asking about the truth of the Gongjia Dam project. I told him everything, and he firmly asked me to invite the person to inspect the situation and hoped to implement it as soon as possible to alleviate the people's difficulties. He said with concern and tears that the water damage was his fault. Driven by my conscience and duty, I resolutely sought to help. I arrived in Shanghai on the 6th and immediately invited Zhuo Jingsan, an engineer who had worked at the Gongjia Dam, and he invited his colleagues, foreign engineer Gaulke and Chinese technician Wan Kaijia. The three of them are now running the Yitai Construction Company. They urged me to go together that night because disaster relief is more urgent than fighting a fire. We arrived in Zhenjiang at 5:00 AM on the 7th and were picked up by personnel sent by the provincial government to the Dahua Hotel to wait for Chairman Jiang to return from Beijing. After meeting and discussing everything, we immediately set off. The provincial government sent Li Yuting to accompany us, and the Department of Construction sent Lu Rixiang and Zhu Taixin to follow us in order to contact and consult along the way. We first arrived at the Xiaoxiantang in Shaobo, a small breach, which was under construction, but the entire town was severely damaged. Looking east, it was a vast ocean, reflecting the West Lake. Going north to Zhaoguan Dam, the dam foundation was still solid, but the east side was breached by dozens of feet. Several miles further north was the Lotus Pond at the Xiankou, which was more than a hundred feet wide, but the water flow was not as rapid as at Zhaoguan Dam. After arriving at Gaoyou, we went around the west embankment and climbed north, crossing to the breach at the Dangjunlou, where the water勢 was rushing and dangerous, more dangerous than the Sichuan River. The waves were surging, and the sound could be heard for several miles. Looking east, the water was over the rooftops, and some of the tiled houses were still sturdy, their tops resisting the waves. To the south of this breach was the breach at Miaoxiangkou, where the water was slower, with an uncollapsed embankment in the middle. These two locations were estimated to be 200 feet wide, and the west embankment was damaged for about 1,000 feet. After half a day of research by the engineers, it was estimated that if the transportation of soil and stone could be well organized and delivered on time and in the required amount, the project could be completed in two months. Thousands of disaster victims gathered on the embankment, hearing the news and crying, begging to be realized as soon as possible, in an extremely tragic state. On the way back to Zhenjiang, we looked for places to extract soil, with Wantou being the most suitable. If it was not enough, we would have to take it from Zhenjiang. We reported to Chairman Ye at noon on the 9th. At the same time, Director Wu Tongju was also present. He was told that the River Works Department and Mr. Wan Xiaoan, who had a wealth of experience in river management, believed that there was really no way to deal with the dangerous breach at Dangjunlou at this time. He also believed that the success of the new method at Gongjia Dam was reliable. At that time, it was decided to ask the engineers to return to Shanghai immediately, collect the equipment, and go to the site for actual measurement as soon as possible to prepare a plan for benefit. Chairman Ye repeatedly stated that the National Government is the people's government. At this time, it is necessary to save lives, and the cost will be borne by him. If there are really difficulties, he will be satisfied if it can be completed in three months. In short, the faster the better. The engineers also said that human beings should have compassion for each other and help each other. As long as their ability allows, they are willing to fulfill their obligations and complete this great project. We arrived in Shanghai that night. I and the engineers all suffered from diarrhea on the way. I could go despite my illness, but the others needed a doctor's examination. After repeated discussions, it was agreed to take a special express train at 10:00 AM tomorrow. If this trip can be implemented, I hope that the fellow villagers in the disaster-stricken counties will quickly organize an assistance group to help collect soil and stones and supervise transportation so that construction can be completed on schedule. If each county sends four people to be responsible for management, and each county can provide dozens of boats to help transport, paying wages, it is not difficult to do. It is hoped that they will work hard to supervise and help the government and the people cooperate to overcome this difficulty. It is also hoped that they will work together to study methods to permanently eliminate floods. We cannot wash them away once every 60 years. I hope all fellow villagers will pay attention. Today, I also met Mr. Cheng Jingsheng, who is also very willing to help. I also heard from the old river management expert, Mr. Wang Shuxiang, that there is no way to deal with the dangerous breach at Dangjunlou. Now that there is a way, as long as everyone supervises and helps, later someone suggested that if it can be completed on schedule as Mr. Shen said, the people of the lower counties should build a temple for each of them and worship them forever. Shen said that the Kuomintang's doctrine is to reduce the suffering of the people and increase the welfare of the people. We members should have this courage and do our best to achieve it. Who would build a clay puppet to be overthrown by others? The meeting dispersed with laughter.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Liu Ruiheng's Report on Epidemic Prevention in Wuhan <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Health and Epidemic Prevention Group of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee began its work after departing from the committee in Wuhan on the 18th of last month. Liu Ruiheng, the director of the group, reported on the work of the group as follows: Our group began its work after arriving in Wuhan on August 10th. We organized a team of health inspectors with police officers and school students, and sent them to work in various shelters. Regarding vaccinations to prevent typhoid fever and cholera, we can administer about 5,000 vaccinations per day. We also implemented clean drinking water and disposal of sewage in the larger shelters. As for medical relief, we used mobile clinics to meet the needs. Currently, the work in the disaster area is only in the Wuhan area, with particular emphasis on shelters with more than 1,000 people. In the future, the health and epidemic prevention equipment of our group will follow the work of the disaster area working group. Maintaining health and protection is as important as providing shelter, food, and drink for disaster victims. Therefore, the most important goals of our group are: (1) to do our best to prevent the spread of epidemics; (2) to remove all unhygienic filth to create a hygienic environment; and (3) to use medical relief equipment to reduce suffering and death. What is even more encouraging is that all parties have expressed their willingness to cooperate with our group in this plan to complete it. For example, (1) the South Manchuria Railway Company is willing to use a ship as an office for health work in the disaster area, and as a storage place for medical supplies. At the same time, a laboratory and pharmacy can be set up; (2) the Shanghai International Relief Committee will hire the Hanamalie ship as a hospital ship, and the Rastoel Institute will set up a laboratory on this ship; (3) governments, charities, and pharmaceutical companies from various countries have donated medical and health supplies. The detailed numbers will be announced separately in the coming days; (4) Most of the positions are filled by doctors, nurses, and sanitation engineers transferred from the Ministry of Health. The Medical College of Central University, Peking Union Medical College, the Chinese Red Cross, and the Japanese Red Cross Society have all had staff members who have gone to Wuhan for work under the guidance of our group. Church doctors across the country have also been notified to join the collaboration. Major hospitals and medical schools have also sent investigation forms requesting volunteers to be completed and returned. The minimum term for this volunteer work is two months. As for the doctors and nurses in Wuhan, they are cooperating with our group and, in addition to their support, their hospital addresses and all equipment can be used, which is especially convenient.</p>

<p>Accident Caused by Pursuit of Pirates</p>
<p>All Officers and Soldiers Rescued</p>
<p>▲ Departing to Suppress Bandits: The Jiangyuan warship of the First Naval Fleet was on patrol in the waters off Zhejiang and Fujian. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, at 2:00 PM, the warship discovered pirate vessels in Xinghua Bay, Fujian. The Jiangyuan warship advanced towards the pirates, who fled into Xinghua Bay. The Jiangyuan pursued, intending to capture them in one fell swoop. However, the pirates were familiar with the sea, their boats were small, and the bay had many hidden reefs. As a result, the Jiangyuan ran aground.</p>
<p>▲ Runs Aground on a Hidden Reef: The Jiangyuan warship entered Xinghua Bay, where navigation was very difficult. At 2:30 PM, the warship ran aground on a hidden reef. The bottom of the ship was pierced by the reef, and seawater entered the cabin. After the accident, it was impossible to move the ship off the reef. The captain sent a radio message for help.</p>
<p>▲ Ten Warships Search: Commander Chen Jiliang of the First Fleet was anxious because he had not heard from the Jiangyuan warship after it pursued the pirates and it had not returned to the fleet. He immediately ordered ten warships under his command to search the sea in different directions. Later, he received a telegram informing him that the Jiangyuan had run aground in Xinghua Bay and sent warships to rescue it.</p>
<p>▲ Technicians Go to Fujian for Rescue: Because the warships could not tow the Jiangyuan, a telegram was sent to the Shanghai Naval Headquarters, contacting the Mitsui &amp; Co. tugboat company in Shanghai. Yesterday, Mitsui sent technician Bentake, along with divers, aboard the Osaka Company's Changsha Maru to Fujian to inspect the situation and determine a salvage plan.</p>
<p>▲ Officers and Soldiers Rescued: Yesterday, Shanghai received confirmation that the officers, soldiers, and crew of the Jiangyuan warship had been rescued by the rescue warship. The ship's hull will be inspected by technicians at a later date to determine a towing plan. The Jiangyuan warship has a displacement of 700 tons and was built by Mitsubishi Shipyard in Japan 25 years ago.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Eight-Year-Old Child Yao Jusheng Missing <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Kidnapped by Bandits</p>
<p>Ransom Note Demands 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Two Male and Female Bandits Arrested</p>
<p>Child's Whereabouts Still Unknown</p>
<p>Yao Gu, a local woman residing at No. 199 Ma'an Lane, Chongqing Road, is 25 years old and a widow with an eight-year-old son named Jusheng, who is exceptionally lively. Around 3:00 PM on July 7th of this year, Yao Gu led her son to visit her mother, Gu Zhao, at No. 96 Taihuai Lane, Annam Road. Unexpectedly, Jusheng suddenly disappeared in front of the house. Searches were conducted everywhere, but it was as if he had sunk into the sea without a trace. By the 9th, Yao Gu's younger brother, Gu Peiheng, received an anonymous letter stating that Jusheng was safe and sound in a certain location and that they should not worry. After receiving the letter, the woman realized that her beloved son had fallen into the hands of bandits and was extremely anxious. However, because the bandits had not specified an address, there was no way to rescue him. Two days later, another letter arrived demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan, stating that someone would be there to meet them if someone was sent to walk from Hartung Road to the Bund. The woman reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered detectives to assist in the investigation. Yao Gu's mother, Gu Zhao, followed the instructions in the letter and walked to the Bund, with detectives following her in secret. However, the bandits did not appear. Several days later, another letter arrived, arranging a meeting at Zhengjia Wood Bridge. As expected, someone arrived to talk and was arrested by detectives and taken to the police station. Under interrogation, he confessed that his name was Tang Jinsheng, and he worked as a tea server at the Dong Sheng Hotel. He said that he had been entrusted with this matter by a guest named Li Jisan in room number one and that he did not know anything else. Chinese and Western detectives went to the hotel to investigate, but the so-called Li Jisan had already fled after hearing the news. It was determined that Tang was not actually involved in the case, so he was released. Several days ago, Yao Gu received another letter, arranging a meeting at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Henan Road at 9:00 AM the day before. She reported the incident to the police, who ordered Chinese detective Jin Yangwu to lead four detectives disguised as rickshaw pullers to the designated location to wait. Gu Zhao, Yao Gu's mother, carried a paper package resembling 20,000 yuan in cash and paced back and forth at the location. Around 10:00 AM, a person arrived in a rickshaw driven by Li Xiaokun from Li Xiaodi Kun. Seeing Gu Zhao carrying the paper package and walking back and forth on the opposite side, he instructed the rickshaw puller Li Xiaokun to go forward and retrieve the package. Li, unaware of the contents, took the paper package from Gu Zhao's hand and handed it over. Just as he was about to pull the rickshaw and run, the detectives, who had witnessed everything, rushed forward and arrested both the rickshaw puller and the passenger, taking them to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The passenger identified himself as Zhu Songlin from Pudong, admitted to being involved in the case, and stated that the child Yao Jusheng was currently at the home of a Suzhou woman named Lu Wang (also known as Sister Er or Little Aunt) at No. 20 Ma Tianxing Lane, Nanshi. Chinese and Western detectives took Mr. Zhu to the Public Security Bureau to join the detectives and arrest Lu Wang. However, the child's whereabouts remain unknown. When questioned, she firmly denied the charges. Both were taken back to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi interrogated them. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the police station, presented the above information, stating that Zhu Songlin, also known as Li Jisan, could be proven by the tea server Tang Jinsheng and that Zhu had previously been a tenant of Gu Zhao, so he knew the situation in Yao Gu's home. However, last month, someone impersonated a bandit and attempted to extort 96 yuan from Yao Gu. The case was discovered, and the person was arrested and sent to the Summary Court, where he was sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Since the child Yao Jusheng has not yet been found, he requested a postponement. Tang Jinsheng, a tea server at the Dong Sheng Hotel, stated that Zhu Songlin arrived on July 15th, opened room number one, claimed to be Li Jisan, and said that a woman named Wang would be arriving, so the name Li Jisan, Li Wang was written in the circulation book. However, the woman never came. Three days later, Li suddenly ordered me to wait at the entrance of the Osmanthus Cake Shop at Zhengjia Wood Bridge, saying that if I saw an old woman wearing black pants and a white short shirt, I could ask her for a paper package containing clothes because the old woman was a relative of his and he was too ashamed to meet her. I was temporarily deceived and went to retrieve it on his behalf, but I was arrested by the detectives. Fortunately, after questioning, it was determined that I was not involved, so I was released, and other statements were made. Yao Gu and Gu Zhao also filed cases one after another, explaining everything. When questioned, Zhu Songlin confessed that he was not at the scene when Yao Jusheng was abducted, but he learned from Lu Wang and her sister Sister Xing (Sister San) and Li's lover Liu Ziyun that Jusheng was hidden at Lu Wang's home. Afterwards, I sent two letters to Yao Gu's home from Hankou and Yichang and admitted to sending people to retrieve the money twice. When questioned, Lu Wang, who runs a brothel, denied abducting Yao Jusheng and hiding him at her home, as well as the extortion. After reviewing the statements, Judge Wu ordered both defendants to be remanded in custody separately and wait for a postponement for further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Bandit Gang Members Fight <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Many Male and Female Robbers Arrested</p>
<p>The serious case of bandits and the Security Corps exchanging gunfire occurred on Xieshi Road, Nanshi, the night before last (the 8th). Two members of the Corps were wounded on the spot. Since then, many bandits have been captured one after another. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Six People Act Suspicious: Xieshi Road, Nanshi, is under the jurisdiction of the Second District General Office, where the Third Defense Unit of the Fifth Team of the First Regiment of the Shanghai Nanshi Security Corps is stationed. The night before last, members of the team finished their training at 8:00 PM and returned home. A squad leader, along with Zhao Zhenfu and Zhang Shanbao, were walking when they suddenly spotted six suspicious-looking men near a street corner at a certain temple bridge. The squad leader shouted a password, but the men suddenly drew pistols and fired at the Corps members.</p>
<p>▲ Two Corps Members Wounded: When the Corps members saw the men firing, they also took down rifles from their shoulders and returned fire. However, it was too late. Zhao and Zhang were each shot and fell to the ground. At the time, the police chief of the New West District of the Second District General Office of the Public Security Bureau happened to be on patrol. He suddenly heard the sound of gunfire and shouts of "robbery." He immediately surrounded the area and captured a robber near a small river.</p>
<p>▲ Bandits Arrested One After Another: Zhao and Zhang were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The captured robber was taken to the station and identified as Chen Zhengying. He said that his accomplices were hiding in a kiosk at No. 36 Yinyu Lane, Baxianqiao. Director Wang obtained the information and immediately ordered detectives to work with the police to arrest Wang Haiqing at the address. Wang had a gunshot wound on the left side of his neck, and there was blood on the bedding, indicating a rifle bullet wound. Shortly after, many people, including the female bandit Wang Zhang, arrived one after another and were arrested one by one. A pistol was found on the female bandit Wang Zhang's person and was taken to the station for verification.</p>
<p>When this case occurred, this newspaper received the news immediately. We originally intended to disclose it the following day, but at the request of District Member Wang of the Second District General Office, we temporarily refrained from publishing it to facilitate the investigation of accomplices. This newspaper, out of respect for District Member Wang's opinion, did not publish it until now. However, other newspapers have already published it, so we are supplementing the facts as above.</p>

<p>The number of civil and criminal cases handled by the Shanghai First Special District Court is increasing daily. After the formal abolition of consular jurisdiction in China by various countries on January 1st of next year, all civil and criminal lawsuits involving foreigners in the Public Concession will be under the jurisdiction of the court. The Ministry of Justice has issued an order to prepare and organize a special tribunal to hear cases involving foreigners. Therefore, the court's courtroom and office space must be increased. Previously, due to the narrow address of the court, it was once planned to purchase civilian land in the East and West Districts to build separately. However, this was abandoned due to a lack of suitable locations and limited funds. Recently, it was decided to demolish the old building connected to the new building in the court and rebuild a five-story steel-concrete building. With this transformation, the height will be increased, and it will be used as a courtroom and office, which will be more than sufficient. Yesterday, President Yang reviewed the new building drawings and specifications prepared by the engineer and found them satisfactory. He immediately announced a call for bids for the construction. The bidding period runs from today until the 14th of this month. Any reliable construction company that has contracted to construct two projects worth over 100,000 taels is eligible to bid. The current location of the old building downstairs is the Document Section, and upstairs is the Sixth Tribunal. Once demolition begins, they will have to relocate temporarily.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Pudong Electric Company Promotes Business <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Loans for Lighting</p>
<p>Rentals of Motors</p>
<p>Since last month, Pudong Electric Company has implemented a loan program for lighting. Those who cannot pay the installation fee in one lump sum can negotiate a loan with the company to be repaid in twelve months. The company does not charge for connecting electricity for users, and the number of deposits required is also very low. Therefore, for small users, for example, if three lights are needed, only a deposit of six yuan is required to enjoy the convenience of electric lights. As a result, small households in general are welcoming the program, and there is an endless stream of applications. It has been heard that the company is adopting a rental program for motors to promote electricity business, so that those who cannot purchase motors at one time can rent them from the company. The rental fees are very low, only enough to offset interest and depreciation losses, and they do not seek any profit. The program has been submitted to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for approval and record. Motors ranging from one horsepower to fifty horsepower are available in stock and can be rented at any time. If a user uses a lot of electricity and can guarantee a certain amount of electricity usage per horsepower per month, they can negotiate with the company to reduce or completely waive the rental fee. These motors are purchased in large quantities from the manufacturers, so their value is lower than purchasing them retail on the market. If a user wishes to purchase one, they can be sold at the original price. If they cannot pay in one lump sum, they can pay in installments. If the user is unclear about the installation and management methods of the motor, the company can design and send personnel to guide them.</p>

<p>Changed to Municipal Treasury Expenditure</p>
<p>Since the meat merchants in the Jiangwan District were approved to establish slaughterhouses in the district, they are exempt from merging the slaughter and inspection of pigs and sheep. The butchers volunteer the slaughter and inspection office costs, a sum of 180 yuan monthly. Later, the meat merchants in other townships and districts also requested a reference example to assume the district veterinarian's inspection office expenses, so it was temporarily approved as a transitional method for centralized slaughter and inspection. In order to sympathize with the meat merchants, it has been approved by the Municipal Health Bureau to be approved by the Municipal Government. From July 20, the expenditure will be covered by the municipal treasury, and all districts that have paid the office inspection fees for July will be returned. The receipts can be taken to the Health Bureau for collection.</p>

<p>Li Sigong and Li Zhengtang were arrested by Lu Liankui, chief detective of the public police station, for suspected involvement in the kidnapping of Lu Shaotang. He was escorted to the First District Court for interrogation and detention. Li and others hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to defend them. They were acquitted after being declared innocent, but the police learned that the two Lis were also related to the kidnapping and murder of Zhu Chengzhang, president of the Guohuo Bank. They were re-prosecuted, and Li and others still hired lawyer Zhan as their defense counsel. The trial has lasted more than half a year, and the debate was reopened once. It was not until last Friday that it was concluded. Yesterday morning was the day for sentencing. Lawyer Zhan Jifeng, the defendant's defender, was also in court waiting for instructions. At 9:00 AM, Judge Feng Shide opened the Second Criminal Court and announced the verdict. The main text stated that Li Sigong and Li Zhengtang were both not guilty, and Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, also stated in court that he would not appeal against the two defendants and requested their release. The court approved the request.</p>

<p>Mardy &amp; Co. at No. 10 Avenue Edward VII will exhibit new Studebaker automobiles from tomorrow onwards for public viewing. This car is completely revolutionary in automotive engineering. Automotive engineers have always wanted to eliminate the vibration of four-cylinder cars, but have never been able to achieve any effect. The Studebaker factory has first invented the principle of natural buoyancy, so the problem of vibration of four-cylinder cars can be solved satisfactorily. In addition, the Studebaker's free clutch is completely different from the free clutch of other cars. This car has a button on the dashboard. When the button is pressed, the car is free to start up. When the button is pulled out, the Klax and gear speed can be used again. Therefore, it can be fully used for free clutch at all forward speeds. As for the Klax, it is only used when starting and stopping the car. Its convenience is like this. It is expected that the public will hear the news and those who go to visit tomorrow will be very crowded.</p>

<p>The Jiangxi Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, Nanjing National Government: "To Chairman Chiang: Reports indicate that Chairman Lu of our province has repeatedly requested to resign, and your government is considering granting his request for rest. Our province has suffered from the Red disaster for several years, and it is difficult to eliminate and easy to revive. This has led to the gathering of large armies, and you have personally led the expedition in the summer heat. Although the root cause of the disaster lies in the cunning schemes of the bandits, the officials in charge have initially abandoned their responsibilities, allowing the bandits to spread rampant. Then, they have been ineffective in suppressing them, fostering a great calamity. Fortunately, relying on your power, the bandit forces have been greatly reduced. However, the remnants are scattered and may reignite. Without someone who understands the provincial situation and is willing to take responsibility, it will be difficult to achieve a fundamental cleanup. We implore your government to select a successor from among the capable and experienced individuals in our province who have been involved in bandit suppression and appoint them to the position. They will be deeply aware of the suffering and plan thoroughly, pursuing the roots of the problem without delay. This will complete your personal expedition and permanently eliminate the great disaster for our hometown. Otherwise, if a military officer from another province is lightly appointed to take over the responsibility, they will not be concerned about the suffering, and they will be timid and foster chaos, repeating the previous mistakes. The selection of personnel is of utmost importance. Our association, learning from past mistakes, offers its sincere advice. We beseech you to adopt it. The people of Jiangxi will be fortunate, and the whole country will be fortunate. Jiangxi Association in Shanghai."</p>
<h3 id="e157">Case of Chinese Electrical Company Employees Requesting Improved Treatment <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Company Has Yet to Respond</p>
<p>Employees Will Take Action</p>
<p>All employees of the Chinese Electrical Company, due to difficult living conditions and unequal treatment, have specifically proposed eight articles for improving treatment and appointed Deng Shuping and eleven others as representatives to write to the company manager to schedule a joint signing. However, there has been no response for a long time. After deliberation by all employees, they jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. Subsequently, the representatives received a No. 73 instruction from the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, stating that the labor-capital agreement draft submitted by the representatives has been reviewed and corrected by the headquarters. In addition to sending a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau, they were instructed to follow the amended plan and sincerely negotiate with the management. The representatives immediately followed the amended labor-capital agreement draft and requested the company to schedule a meeting for negotiation again. However, Lu Bohong, the manager of the company, still has not made a firm statement on this matter. All employees believe that the company's business has experienced amazing expansion in recent years, but the manager has not made any effort to improve the difficult living conditions of the employees. Now, their reasonable demands have not been accepted with sincerity. They are extremely indignant. It is reported that the representatives, seeing the intense feelings of the employees, feel that they cannot maintain the situation. They have published a notice in the newspapers, stating that they will be responsible for another five days, from September 11th to 15th. During this period, they hope that the company manager will meet with the representatives to seriously negotiate and agree on the measures proposed by all employees to improve treatment, in order to appease public anger. If the company continues to ignore the issue or if other complications arise, the representatives will not be responsible. It is unknown what kind of response the company authorities will have upon seeing this.</p>

<p>Reader's Correspondence</p>
<p>Ms. Lan's Message</p>
<p>I am a lonely woman. I lost my father when I was nine years old. My father, on whom our family depended for a living, abandoned us halfway, and we suddenly lost our security and could no longer make a living. I was fortunate enough to be adopted by my aunt as a goddaughter. Since my aunt took me in, she has used her hard-earned salary to cultivate me to this day. I have gone from primary school to the second year of higher normal school. She survived a disaster and hopes that I will be able to support her for the rest of her life after I graduate. I am very timid at school and, apart from my studies, I am oblivious to everything else, because I am eagerly waiting to receive my diploma so that I can quickly earn money to support my elderly mother, comfort my hardworking aunt, and raise my two young beloved sisters. I feel the great responsibility and work even harder day and night. However, unfortunate people are always plagued by unfortunate events, putting me in a situation where I can neither live nor die. I have a cousin who is four years older than me, now twenty-one years old. He is very knowledgeable and has a good disposition, but unfortunately, he dropped out of school for the sake of his family. We played together since we were little, and when we were fifteen, we embarked on the path of true love. After two years of sacred love, he proposed marriage. He informed his parents several times, but his stubborn parents, disliking me for being a poor family's daughter, flatly refused. He argued vehemently but failed and was bedridden for a month, and repeatedly wanted to commit suicide to repay me. At the time, although I also hated the despotism of his family, I could not bear to cause a misfortune or even break up his happy family because of me alone, so I advised him to obey his parents and not to be a sinner against Confucianism. One woman's gain or loss is not worth being so passive. Although I comforted him with earnest words, he remained as passive as before. He is now being oppressed by a bad environment and has finally become engaged to his mother's niece. When he became engaged, he was still sick. After he recovered, the situation was a fait accompli and could not be reversed. But now, even though he is a married man, his love for me has not diminished at all. Sir, I am very confused now. Can I still love him? Can I still accept his control? I understand very well that his love is real, and if I stop loving him, he will be even more passive than he is now. But if this goes on, it will be like a small boat going out to sea with no turning back. Sir, please give me a clear path, I will be infinitely grateful. Because he also reads the newspaper every day, so just leaving a word Lan is enough.</p>
<p>(Reply) Since he (is a married man), you should of course not give your love to him again. Even if he still loves you, you must avoid suspicion. If his family develops resentment because of you, wouldn't you feel even more uneasy? Didn't you once advise him (not to cause a misfortune to the whole family because of me alone)? So from now on, you are loving him by not loving him.</p>
<p>Didn't you advise him (a woman's gain or loss is not worth being so passive)? Good, you are truly a woman of great integrity. You should also tell him, how great is the meaning of life, how great is the responsibility, how great is the future. Is it possible that a dignified man should spend his youth and good time in the sea of love between men and women, even if it is counted? Have you forgotten about school? Have you forgotten about service? Have you forgotten about your divine duty to the country and to society? You should also tell him, although I am a woman, from now on, I will go to school, I will serve, I do not want to completely bind the four limbs and five senses, which heaven and earth gave me and my parents nurtured, in a hazy and upside-down love network. I want to be a vigorous and promising citizen of the country and a member of society. You should say this to him very clearly and directly.</p>
<p>Message from Mr. Bao Jianxin</p>
<p>I am a high school graduate. Since graduation, due to circumstances, I have not been able to continue my studies. My temperament is close to the field of electrical engineering, so after dropping out of school, I have been groping around on my own. At the same time, I enrolled in a mechanical engineering course at an American correspondence school. At that time, tuition was only five yuan per month. Later, due to money problems, I did not graduate, but except for a part of the factory practice textbook, I did not study, I finished reading the theoretical part. At the same time, I also read books on electricity and researched radio receivers (the Kailuo Company was just established at that time), and made applied instruments by hand. I have been doing this blindly for five years, and I have a lot of interest and experience. My current ability to make a living depends on this self-study. However, now I feel that (1) what I know is too superficial. If I spend my whole life in such a small power radio station, that's fine. But I hope to have development in the future and be able to go to an international radio station, then my knowledge is naturally not enough. I want to study further on my own, but the problem is that (2) my mathematics background is too shallow. I only learned trigonometry (I have not learned solid geometry and trigonometry). If I read a slightly more advanced book, I must understand calculus. Now I want to review algebra and trigonometry that I have already learned from the beginning, and then buy high school mathematics books in the bookstore, such as higher algebra, analytic geometry, and calculus. Which books are easy to self-study? (3) I want to find a factory practice position. On the one hand, I can increase my experience, and on the other hand, I can get closer to the engineering industry. I don't know if there is such an opportunity in Shanghai. (4) My goal of self-study is to obtain the academic ability to pass the electrical engineer qualification examination, so that I can have the qualification to be an engineer. If I can't become an engineer, I will achieve the academic qualification of an electrical engineering worker at a lower level no matter what. Can the gentleman give me a systematic reading list?</p>
<p>(Reply) The questions you asked are mostly about radio technology. I have invited Mr. Cao Zhongyuan, an expert, to answer your questions one by one. (1) There is no particularly different calculation principle in radio science. Now, for practical application and to make it easier to get started, I recommend two books as follows: (a) A short Course in Elementory Mathematicsand their Application to Wireless Telegraphy. by S.J. Willis. (b) Mathematics for Wireless Amateursby F.M. Colebrook B.Sc, A.C.Y.I.D.I.C. The second type is published in the famous wireless radio magazine, Experimental Wireless and Wireless Wngineers. Volume III P.283 (May 1926) to Volume IV p.927 (Dec. 1937). The publishing locations of the above two books are as follows: Iliffe &amp; Sons Ltd,. Dorset House, TudorSt., London.&amp;</p>
<p>. C.4. In addition, there is a differential and integral calculus. It is necessary for young engineers to read or review. The name of the book is Calculus Made Easy. byanus P. Thompson, F.R.S. Macnillan &amp; Co., Ltd., St. Martin'sＳt, Lcndou. (2) There are many such opportunities, but it is necessary to have the guarantee of power. Try to find a way to go to the Telecommunications Manufacturing Factory of the Ministry of Communications in Pudong or the Radio Manufacturing Factory of the Construction Committee in Gaochang Temple. This issue is very important for the future of science and the training of scientific talents and should be the responsibility of the country. It is expected that the Department of Physics and Chemistry of the Academia Sinica will be able to undertake this task. Private institutions are limited by their expensive and limited power and cannot accommodate it, and the progress is slow. (3) Since you want to be an engineer, the purpose is not to take the exam. Now, for engineering, I will introduce some readings as follows: (a) Wireless Principles and Pratice. by I.S. Palmer, M.Sc., Ph.D., F.Inst.P., A.M.I.E.E. Publishing house Langmans, Green &amp; Co., Ltd., 39 Palermoster Row, London, E.C.4. (b) Elements of Radio Commumnication. b-John H. Morecroff. Publishing House, Telegraph &amp; Telyephone Age. Broadway, New York (c(Electric Oscillations &amp; Waves. by Dr. Pierce. (d) The Theory &amp; Practicecof RadioFrequency Measurements.and edition published in the United States. by E.B, Moullin Publishing house, Charles Griffin &amp; Co., Ltd., 42, Drury Lane, Lcndon, W.Ｃ.2 In addition, there are three types of books that should be prepared daily for engineers (wireless radio): (a) WirelessTelegraphist'sPocket Book. by J.A. Fleming, Iliffe &amp; Sons Ltd., Londod. Publishing (b) Radil Eng.ineering With special Sections on Telegraphand Telephiny. by J.HReyner, B.Sc.(Hons.) A.C.G.I.

The Principles of electricwave Telegraph &amp; Telephony The Admiralty Handbook of Wireless Telegraphy published in 1928 (Publishing House): His Majesty'sc Stationary Office, Adastral House, Kingaway, London, W.C.2. Submitted by Liyang County Government, prohibiting the transportation of rice out of the country, which violates provincial orders and harms people's food, Yang Xinhe shows that the rice and grain in the province of Jiangsu have recently been without prohibiting rice, and the Shanghai Municipal Government has approved the reply of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the case of leaving the country, which roughly means that rice and grain are allowed to circulate in the province of Jiangsu, and the county should be ordered to follow the past chapters. Now that only one month has passed, the Liyang County Government has re-announced the prohibition of rice from leaving the country. If the association has repeatedly reported by members, the county has previously transported rice to Shanghai for relief, and they have all been blocked by the ban. Although the flood in Jiangsu Province this year is serious, Liyang is located at a higher level, and the autumn harvest is not much different from previous years, but it is equal to the normal year. At this time, the disaster is extremely serious, and it is appropriate to have mutual communication and help in times of emergency, so that we can plan and adjust and spend this strange disaster. In this county, if each county is forbidden, not only the people in the disaster area have no hope of survival, but also the areas where the population is concentrated and production is insufficient are inevitably starving. In the early autumn of previous years, Shanghai Lai An Xian and Liyang Yixing Xian Rice were used to provide relief. This year, Anhui Province was hit by a disaster, and the source was cut off. The people's food depends entirely on Liyang Yixing early Xian, and among them, Liyang produces more. If the ban is not lifted, the food problem in Shanghai will be deeply affected. For the special report to your bureau, I would like to ask the municipal government to quickly consult the Jiangsu Provincial Government and order the Liyang County Government to lift the ban to maintain the people's food. I can't wait to pray, Jin Chengyunyun.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Postal Workers' Rice Subsidy Issue <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Not a New Request</p>
<p>Based on Old Agreement</p>
<p>Due to the sudden increase in rice prices last year, the postal workers' union requested Wei Yihu, the former postmaster general, to forward the request to the Ministry of Communications for the issuance of rice subsidies. The method was to provide a subsidy of three yuan for those with a monthly salary of 50 yuan or less when the rice price was above 16 yuan, and two yuan for those with a monthly salary of more than 50 yuan but less than 80 yuan. The monthly salary was calculated excluding subsidies. It was decided to implement it from May 19th. At that time, former General Manager Wei and Dou Juecang, the current director of the Ministry of Communications, were responsible for the agreement. In April of this year, when the rice price fell below 16 yuan, the postal workers' union complied with the agreement and also agreed to stop the subsidy. However, in recent months, the rice price has gradually soared above 16 yuan again. According to the agreement, the General Administration should issue it as usual. Therefore, the postal workers' rice subsidy is not a new request. The report that the Ministry of Communications has rested is not true.</p>

<p>In this port this week, there is often a mysterious car on the roads (see the picture above),</p>
<p>Rushing past, the patrolmen in various districts saw this car for the first time, as if no one was driving it, so they paid great attention to it and repeatedly blocked its progress,</p>
<p>It is reported that the truth about this mysterious car will be announced soon, and people from all walks of life are welcome to try it.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to flip through the above books, which only list the most common and practical books on radio science, which are the minimum books that engineers must read. There are many other specialized books, classified into many categories, such as Television, Pho-toelectri Cells, Piezo-eletric effect, DirectionFinding and Directional reception, Beacon andwater signal, Wireleos Piclure. Vacuum Tubes, etc., are not included. However, the price of books is affected by the high price of gold, and private individuals cannot afford to buy them separately. It is best for the national library to purchase them, or, by several radio pioneers who are now together, a library is easily organized for all enthusiasts. European and American countries will include the books of each person in the wireless radio company and the factory, and there are specialized libraries, collecting radio books and magazines published in various countries around the world, and related physics, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, and minerals, etc., for engineers to study. This kind of organization can be imitated in our country.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Preparations for the National Anti-Drug Representatives Conference <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Set Up Preparation Offices in Different Regions</p>
<p>Send Personnel to Various Provinces to Promote</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association is actively proceeding with the convening of the National Anti-Drug Representatives Conference in accordance with the resolutions of the Standing Committee, and has decided that the conference will be held from November 1st to 5th of this year. The Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters in Hangzhou and the Hangzhou YMCA have been designated as the two venues. During the conference, it is planned to erect a monument to Premier Sun's anti-drug teachings in the name of all the representatives of the conference in the Sixth Park of West Lake in Hangzhou, as a permanent standard for drug prohibition. Regarding the travel of representatives, the Ministry of Railways has been requested to grant a half-price privilege, which will be issued by the conference preparatory office in the future for passage. All preparatory matters for the conference have been planned and actively handled. A conference preparatory office has been established at the Shanghai Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and the Hangzhou Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association. In addition, Northeast Preparation Office has been established at the Shenyang Liaoning Anti-Drug Association, North China Preparation Office has been established at the Tianjin Hebei Anti-Drug Association, South China Preparation Office has been established at the Fuzhou Fujian Anti-Drug Association, Southwest Preparation Office has been established at the Kunming Yunnan Anti-Drug Association, West China Preparation Office has been established at the Chengdu Sichuan Anti-Drug Association, East China Preparation Office has been established at the Hangzhou Zhejiang Anti-Drug Association, and Nanyang Preparation Office has been established at the Nanyang Singapore Anti-Drug Association. The directors of each office have also been separately appointed and will begin work immediately. On the one hand, the conference preparatory office will send special personnel to the Northeast, North China, South China, East China, and Nanyang regions to promote the mission of the conference, in order to arouse the sympathy of people across the country. In recent days, anti-drug groups from all over the world have been sending letters and telegrams to inquire about the details of the conference, and there must be many inquiries every day. It is reported that the conference preparatory office has now started to solicit proposals from various organizations and anti-drug groups, which will be submitted to the proposal review committee for review and then submitted to the conference. In addition, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association previously handled the memorial of Lin Gong Zexu forever based on the resolutions of the June 3 Memorial Conference. It has again requested the Hangzhou Municipal Government to allocate three rooms in the Pinghu Qiuyue Building in West Lake to serve as the Lin Zexu Memorial Hall to display anti-drug education exhibits. This undertaking has been negotiated several times by Chen Lingyun, the general manager of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Drug Association, and the Hangzhou authorities, and Huang Jiahui, the general manager of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, has also gone to discuss it. In the future, a detailed plan will be submitted to the National Congress for approval, in order to establish a permanent memorial. Pinghu Qiuyue is one of the ten famous scenic spots in West Lake. In the future, it will be used to commemorate the anti-drug pioneers, which can be said to be suitable for both people and places.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Learning Half a Cavendish <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Sir Henry Cavendish, an Englishman, was born in 1731 and died in 1810. This Double Tenth Day marks the bicentennial of his birth.</p>
<p>He was a wealthy scientist, a scientist with wealth.</p>
<p>He discovered hydrogen gas in 1766, calling it "Inflammable Air"; in 1784, he proved that water is formed by the explosion of inflammable air and one-fifth of common air, with that one-fifth being the oxygen that Lavoisier named. In 1798, he determined the specific gravity of the earth, allowing us to know its immense weight without having to weigh the entire planet. He had many inventions; these are his primary contributions.</p>
<p>Although Cavendish made significant academic contributions, he was inherently solitary and antisocial, especially disliking the company of women. If he happened to see a female servant in his home, she would invariably be dismissed. In his later years, when someone hosted a banquet to honor his contributions, he escaped through the back door. Upon his death, he dismissed his only servant, so he could leave the world alone and unburdened.</p>
<p>He often kept his scientific experiments secret. Fifty years after his death, his notes were finally published. Thus, the words "Cavendish" and "Selfish" became associated. Selfish scientists have since had an archetype, using Cavendish as a shield. They have learned half of Cavendish, actually learning the worse half while forgetting the better. They only care about climbing the tree of science, picking the ripe fruit for themselves, and throwing the peel and seeds down. They don't care whether the brothers at the bottom of the tree can eat or not. They have learned Cavendish's reclusiveness and selfishness while forgetting his efforts towards great inventions.</p>
<p>After Cavendish's death, Berthelot said: (Chemistry is a French science, and its founder Lavoisier is immortal). Sir Ed. Thorpe retorted: (Chemistry is an English science, and its founder Cavendish is immortal). If the aloof Cavendish had a spirit, he would surely laugh at Berthelot and Thorpe's pointlessness.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Recording Old Feelings About Decaying Lotus Flowers <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>The gentlemen and ladies of Xicheng, during the height of summer, all consider drinking tea in the park the only pastime. The deep shade provides refuge from the scorching sun. The narrow, noisy and dusty city finds a haven of coolness there. I especially love the area around Hanbi Bridge. The pond has lotus flowers, and whenever they are in bloom, I lean on the railing, enjoying the view of the water. I often stay until late at night. I remember a line: ("Ten thousand round pearls run across the jade plate; a pond of shattered moon covers the flower's shadow.") The beauty of the scene is imaginable. This summer, when the pond's lotus flowers bloomed profusely, it was during a time of widespread flooding. There were few visitors, which was a shame. Moreover, I was briefly away for two weeks. Autumn rain covers Maoling, and Xiangru is already ill. Fallen flowers cover the lake, and Du Mu arrives late. Returning to Liangxi, just after getting off the train, I immediately went to the park to see them. I only saw the lush lotus leaves, with the fish still playing east and west. The flowers, except for three or five standing tall, had their pollen and beauty fallen, leaving their marks on the water. The fragrant red lotus is gone, and the person in the blue shirt is old. Another year has easily passed, and it is autumn wind again. Only facing these understanding famous flowers, I compose a short poem of sorrow. Thus, there is a regulated verse about decaying lotus flowers: The lotus picking song ends, and the heat initially recedes; red and green scatter, evoking old travels. The fallen flowers have never returned to the murky mud; the withered branches still entrust themselves to the clear stream. Having experienced wind, rain, heat, and cold, lying in the rivers and lakes, the scenery is autumnal. In the blink of an eye, prosperity becomes flowing water; even the old mandarin ducks are full of sorrow.</p>

<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>▲ Her Daily Life</p>
<p>Furthermore, she loves music. This is the influence her father had on her, because her father was the leader of the Petrograd Symphony Orchestra. She is proficient in piano. Jazz music is also one of her loves. So, every day after 4 p.m., people passing by her house can often hear the resounding and pleasing sound of the piano. Helen told the reporter, ("Dancing is also one of my favorite sports. I dance almost every night.") Indeed, she is proud. In the dance hall, she is often praised for how graceful her dancing posture is. She also loves swimming, ice skating, riding horses, and driving cars. She said confidently, ("I can drive the car as fast as lightning.") Her daily life is roughly as follows: She gets up at 7:30 in the morning. After breakfast, she drives herself to school. She studies business. She often goes home for lunch. After returning home from school at 4 p.m., she practices the piano or reads until dinner. Because she likes to eat early, she has dinner at 7 p.m. After dinner, she goes to see a movie, or goes dancing, or strolls along Avenue Joffre with friends.</p>
<p>▲ The Seven-Hour Sleep System</p>
<p>Helen said, ("I think seven hours of sleep is enough for a girl.") Although she talks like this, during summer vacation, she often sleeps for about ten or eleven hours. She has very few friends. She said she only has one girlfriend, named Lei Tailu Pengwei, who is her friendly neighbor. Helen's mother grew up in Crimea. She was already known for her beauty in her hometown at the age of seventeen. Her father was a native of Petrograd. When it comes to the secrets of beauty, Helen said she has none, but she pays close attention to her health and diet. According to her, she has never reduced her food intake like American movie stars.</p>
<p>▲ A Lover of Sour and Spicy Foods</p>
<p>The reporter asked, ("What kind of food does the lady like to eat?") She seemed to understand that this question was related to her beauty, so she casually replied, ("Sour and spicy food.") The reporter couldn't help but say in surprise, following her, ("Sour and spicy food?") ("That's right. Sour and spicy food.") she replied to me in a musical voice. She has never drunk milk or eaten eggs. Meat seems to be one of her favorite foods.</p>
<p>▲ The Dragon is Not Meant to be in a Pond</p>
<p>The reporter asked, ("Has the lady ever participated in the beauty contest?") ("No. This is the first time many people have said that I am a child. But I am confident. I am not a child in any way.") She said that she has the extravagant hope of going on stage, but she is unwilling to bury herself in a Shanghai that is as big as a house. She wants to go to Hollywood and New York to develop her acting talent. She does not smoke, but sometimes she drinks some champagne. In short, Ms. Helen is a beautiful and young girl. In addition to her existing gorgeous clothes, her parents' love, the huge amount of money for her to spend, one or two cars, and seeking pleasure in the dance hall, she needs music and a young husband, as she herself said, to make her life more fulfilling.</p>

<p>▲ The Busiest Woman in London</p>
<p>Miss Phyllis Gordon, a Scottish girl, is only twenty-two years old this year. She has extremely beautiful features. She works thirteen hours a day, dances six hours, and sleeps four hours. The rest of the time is spent on three meals a day. She has now jumped to become a director of a London hotel company, completely managing the busiest hotel and bearing heavy responsibilities. This lady can be regarded as the busiest woman in London. The general working women in our country are probably envious of her.</p>
<p>▲ A Four-Year-Old Piano Expert</p>
<p>In North-umberland, England, there is a miner named Sherrington. He has a son named Sidney, who is only four years old, but already plays the piano well. His ten fingers land on the keys, making a sound like large and small pearls falling on a jade plate. Professor Stafford, a music expert from Sudland, conducted a rigorous examination of him and sighed at his rare talent. Perhaps he will shake the world in the future. (Haik)</p>
<h3 id="e176">Anecdotes from the Neighborhood <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Yun</p>
<p>Next door lives a Cantonese family. The third floor is rented by a lady from Wuxia. Her movements seem quite secretive. She goes out at night and returns in the morning light. The sound of her knocking on the door always disturbs my sweet dreams. My family all look down on her, saying that this lady is immersed in the city's nightlife and is probably like the "Vamp" described in Western stories. I also thought so. Therefore, I had a curious desire to spy on where she goes at night. But after a long time, I couldn't find out, and gradually I put it aside.</p>
<p>One night, I was out with a friend and entered a certain dance hall. Across from us was a dance partner, who was the lady from next door. I told my friend about it, and we got up and danced with her. Her posture was graceful and charming. Asking her name, it was Zhu Lilin.</p>
<p>After a long time, I became familiar with Lilin. Lilin gradually told me about her life experiences, often sobbing. She had experienced the vicissitudes of life. She said, ("A good husband, how can one look up to him for life? When a woman is unmarried, she is like a bird in the forest, free to protect herself with innocence. Once married, she is like a phoenix in a cage. Those who are lucky become playthings for self-comfort, while those who are unlucky are worn down and killed. I married at sixteen. My husband initially treated me well, but then he was seduced by a wanton woman and heartlessly abandoned me. Helplessly, I remarried, for the sake of life. But fate is often perverse, and I sighed even more at marrying the wrong person. Soon after, I remarried, but it was in vain. Now I work in the dance industry. It is not what I want, but I have no choice.")</p>
<p>Her story is ordinary and unremarkable, but it is an ancient and modern tragedy that beauty is fleeting. In the brightly lit and wine-filled places, even with the extreme pleasure of jade smiles and pearl fragrances, many people have sleeves full of tears or secretly wipe away tears.</p>
<p>I remembered that Ms. Shi Huangsun once had a good film (The Love History of a Female Singer), which depicts the romance and pain of a female singer in every detail. Therefore, I thought that the encounters of dance hall girls, if someone could depict them well, would have a thousand times more strangeness, whether it is romance or pain. Why is today's so-called sound song and dance film in the West so uniform, only using the dance hall's prosperity and splendor as superficial decorations?</p>
<p>Recently, I learned that the Minzhong Guosheng Sound Film Company produced a film (Such is Paradise). Its special feature lies in its unique and poignant depiction beyond prosperity and splendor. All the hidden pains of the family and the darkness of society can be seen through the transformation of a dancer, giving a very deep and vivid impression. In addition to the enjoyment of romance, the audience gets a very enthusiastic stimulus. I will invite Lilin to watch it, and she will probably have even more feelings of sympathy.</p>

<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Li Jingxi</p>
<p>After Yuan Shikai dissolved the parliament, he established a political conference, advocating the reorganization of various societies. Li Zhongxuan (Jingxi) was then a guest in the capital, actively seeking advancement. Shikai did not want to give him an important position but praised his eloquent talent, appointing him chairman of this conference. Jingxi was overjoyed, quite invigorated. After the conference ended, he was given the position of senator, which disappointed him. He often told people that his merits were not rewarded. He aspired to govern Sichuan and Guangdong. Shikai heard of this and summoned his son, Guojun, for an audience. Yang Xingcheng (Shiqi), the Left Vice-Minister of the Government Affairs Hall, also praised Guojun's talent and knowledge, saying he was capable of shouldering responsibilities. He was then appointed Governor of Guangdong. Guojun declined and was about to take up his new post when Xiangcheng told him: "Your father's spirit and talent are a hundred times better than mine. With time, when my term ends, the one who will inherit China will be no one else but him." Guojun replied yes, yes. He retired and told his father about it. Jingxi stamped his feet and said, "It's over." It was then that he realized that Shikai respected him but did not trust him. He then lived in seclusion in Xijin. It was rumored that Qian Gancheng (Nengxun), the Right Vice-Minister, was going to transfer Jingxi. He wrote a letter to Shiqi, saying that although he was old, his heart was still strong, and he was not accustomed to living in seclusion. He wished to assist the central government. Shiqi showed the letter to Shikai, implying that he was giving way to a worthy person. Shikai said, "Why is Zhong hesitant to leave?" Gancheng was also not allowed to leave him far away. He told Zhongxuan, "If it is appropriate, I will definitely rely on him." After a short while, Ding Zhenduo, the president of the Audit Court, died in office. Jingxi was appointed to replace him. The order stated (Li Zhaozhen will act as an agent before he takes office). Jingxi was in Tianjin and was about to go to Beijing to take office. Angered by Shikai's manipulation, he resigned from the post. From then until the end of Xiangcheng's term, he did not discuss political affairs. When Huangpi was in power, he was appointed to the Grand Secretariat. After only three days, he encountered a disaster and fled south in disarray. He died soon after. His fellow villager, Gong Xianzhou (Xinzhan), was then in charge of the interior, writing an article to ask the governing Duan to issue a decree to commend and honor him. Jingxi, Qirui, and Xinzhan were all from Hefei.</p>

<p>(Lanzhen is your friend. I'm helping her, partly because I pity her and partly because of your relationship. Don't get jealous and turn this into a big issue! With a fierce wife like you, how would a husband dare to move?)</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's explanation only made Mrs. Chen even more suspicious and ignited her anger. She sternly questioned Mr. Chen. Generally, if friends have occasional disagreements, a quarrel can be avoided if one party is tolerant. The stricter the criticism between husband and wife, the easier it is to cause conflict. So, they quarreled.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen did feel sorry for Lanzhen. At the same time, he thought about his wife's wasteful spending, not appreciating his hard work in earning money. He couldn't help but feel resentful. He had never expressed such resentment before, but now that he had such an opportunity, he vented it out. He couldn't stop himself.</p>
<p>(You suspect me. I can swear to God that my heart is more upright than anyone else's. Tell me, what have you seen or heard that makes you suspicious? But I trust you very much. Although you often play cards with Li Jingbo and go to dance halls together, sometimes you come home two or three hours late, if I wanted to suspect you of something improper, I could strictly interfere with you. Think for yourself. In these past few years, which thing have you considered for me? My socks are torn, and you don't mend them for me, but you buy silk stockings for yourself, each pair costing five and a half dollars. If you don't buy them, that's fine, but when you buy them, you always buy half a dozen at a time. How much do you spend on social expenses each month? I always go home by eight or nine o'clock at the latest every night. What about you?)</p>

<h3 id="e179">Several Fluctuations in Gold Price <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Situation is Unpredictable, Ultimately Rising by More Than Four Taels Yesterday, on the 10th, the gold price showed a rebound trend in the upper reaches, but the situation was unpredictable, fluctuating high and low, with restless ups and downs, often with three or four taels of swing, chaotic and helpless. From morning to evening, there were as many as thirteen or fourteen taels of difference, but ultimately, it rose by more than four taels. It seems that if the silver market rises, it is because there is a lot owed, especially because there is no date set for the International Silver Conference. The telegram the day before yesterday said that it would be implemented, but it was just air, and the industry was manipulated by it, so the gold price opened high. However, the buyers suddenly became eager, and the exchange rate rose, immediately weakening and falling eight or nine taels, suddenly becoming a low price of 754 taels. Afterwards, speculators and certain banks competed to buy, and the exchange rate improved from deficit to good. The banks unexpectedly bought in, and then the situation became very good, stimulating a rise of ten taels. The market became more profitable, buyers flourished, and it exceeded 765 taels or more. The psychology of the industry turned firm, the opposite of the situation the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Morning Market, Waves Appear From Time to Time</p>
<p>At the opening of the October market, it increased by one tael and three mace, at 761 taels and a half. Large bars slightly rose by one-sixteenth to one-eighth, and the US silver price increased by three-eighths. However, the US stock fell slightly by seven or eight jiao, so the market sentiment was good. It continued to rise to 63 taels, but because Sen Changyong, Lu Mou, Chang Yuan, Da Yongyuan, Mao, etc. were selling, and it was learned that HSBC would have to extend, the banking transaction market also turned loose. Shanghai first entered October 1875, then 25, and then the daily gold was first advanced by Japanese banks by one tael, six qian, one fen, two five, and later only one tael, six qian, zero six two five, causing the gold price to plummet. It ended at 54 taels. Suddenly, Qian Changxiang, a certain bank, Hengxing, etc. came up to compete for the purchase, and it suddenly pulled up more than two taels, to 56 taels and three qian. Although the British gold was revealed to have increased by 25, the US gold by five jiao, and the Japanese gold by three fen, it was not moved, only decreasing by a few qian, at 55 taels and eight qian. Hengxing, Shengda, Fuxingyong, etc. still had purchases, and it increased to seven taels and nine qian, but the internal market was average. The banks bought October and remained at 25, so it retreated to five taels and a half. In an instant, it had turned to purchase. As for the British gold forward, Mitsui, etc. ate 25, November did 1875, and Japanese gold was available for sale at one tael, six qian, one fen, so the gold price happily rose by more than four taels, to 60 taels and zero three qian at 10:30. Then it suppressed a little over one tael, close to 11 o'clock at 57 taels and nine qian, then the hedging sold off. Then, Shanghai absorbed October British gold at 125, and Mitsui and Datong mutually did December US gold at $30.0625, so it increased to 62 taels again. In a moment, it dropped to 60 taels again. This was just a market adjustment. At 11:30, Yuanmao, Yongheng Yu, etc. chased in. It was heard that Wu Mou let go, and the Indian exchange reported a small four or five annas. By 11:30, it rose to 63 taels and a half. The Guangdong gang sold off and retreated to two taels and one qian, but the buyers were still strong. The noon closing was 64 taels, and the revealed price was changed to 790 taels and zero two qian, with a discount of 34 or 5 taels to more than 26 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Market Sentiment Turns Firm, The Market Trends Beautifully</p>
<p>The latter market opened at 63 taels and eight qian, then from four taels to three taels and two qian. Then the Indian exchange reported a small two or three annas, and Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng Yuanda Yong, etc. came in, and it rose to four taels and six qian. Not long after, it retreated to 63 taels. At 2:20, the buyers were active. It was heard that a certain bank had entered more than 400 bars, and Chen Fengyong Yuancheng Dada Xingyong, etc. vigorously entered, so the forward British gold advanced by Mitsui from 125 to .0625, so at around 3:00 it was 67 taels and a half. Afterwards, Dachengyong, etc. sold, and it was heard that the Indian exchange returned to one anna, and it immediately逊 three taels, but the ups and downs were very small until 4:00 it was suppressed to 64 taels and a half. Then there was more than one tael of advance and retreat, but the transaction was average, and the situation seemed confusing, from five taels and eight qian to four taels and six qian. By the time of closing at 4:30, it was 64 taels and nine qian, an increase of four taels and seven qian compared to the previous day. According to the city, the maximum price was 67 taels and a half, and the minimum price was 54 taels, a difference of thirteen taels and five.</p>
<p>▲ Little Trading in Spot Naked Bars</p>
<p>The morning market price of spot was 61 taels and four qian, the noon closing was four qian, and the afternoon price was four taels and two qian, with the closing price being four taels and a half. The revealed price was discounted from 26 or 7 taels to 23 taels, resulting in more than 25 taels. The listed price was 61 taels, 64 taels, with a supplementary water of 61 taels, 62 taels. Spot naked bars were sold by the guest gang to Yingfeng Hengyi for one or two hundred taels, an increase of seven taels and seventy-five. The market was average, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>▲ Major Players Were Chasing in Yesterday</p>
<p>The trading on the table was a greater demand than supply, the opposite of the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the major players were chasing in to buy what they sold the day before, and their minds were confused, making it incomprehensible. According to statistics, Yuanmao Feng, Yuancheng Yong, Tian Fengyong, Wanxing, Yuanheng, Yongxiang, Yuancheng, Hengxing, Qian Changxiang (it was heard that it was buying more than a thousand bars on behalf of a certain bank), Bingxing, Yuanxing Yong, Cuichang Yong, Hongxing, Fuxing Yong, Tong Taichang were all buying. Sen Changyong, Zhifeng Yong, Hengchang Yong, Yifeng, Futai Heng, Yuan Da Yong, Shunli were all selling. Daxing Yong, Yuanmao, Yuantai, Da Decheng, Fuchang, Richang were all selling and then buying. In the afternoon, Chen Fengyong, Yuancheng, Wanxing, Shunli, Dingchang, Yuan Da Yong, Chen Da Yong, Da Xingyong, Zhifeng Yong, Yifeng Yong, Yuanmao Yong were all buying. A certain bank bought more than 400 bars. Chen Luo Wu, etc. were all buying. Bingxing, Cuichang Yong, Hengchang Yong and hedgers were all selling. Other numbers were sometimes buying and sometimes selling, and the situation was chaotic. The Dalian gang chased in 3,000, then sold 1,000. The Guangdong gang bought 2,000 several hundred bars, then sold 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Big Bar Retraction .0625 <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, 10th, London telegram, silver price suddenly fell back, recent twelve pence nine three seven five, forward thirteen pence, each contracting point zero six two five compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Sharp Contrasts in Foreign Exchange, Both Overt and Covert <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, silver markets in England, America, and India all reported increases. Essentially, HSBC's listed rates had been raised by one increment across the board. British gold was at 25, now 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 875 points. American gold was half a yuan, totaling 30 yuan, 0125 points. Japanese gold decreased by three fen, totaling 1 tael, 6 qian, and 4 fen. Other exchanges also changed accordingly. However, Hong Kong remained at 80 taels, 025 points. It seems that the domestic interbank market was initially stable, then loosened, and improved again in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold decreased by 125 points, American gold by 25 points, and Japanese gold increased by half a fen. Truly, the overt and covert markets differed greatly. This was because the gold market was stable in the morning, then weakened, and then rose again, a situation opposite to the previous day. Therefore, sentiment shifted from weak to strong, mainly because there was no definite date for the International Chamber of Commerce silver market meeting. The telegraph news of the previous day was all due to speculative action. Chinese merchants continued to trade actively, still selling off. It is estimated that about 300,000 pounds of British gold were traded, mostly absorbed by Japanese banks. It is said that gold firms are short over one million pounds, and hedging departures are estimated at 78 taels. In addition, 200,000 to 300,000 yuan of American gold was traded, and Japanese gold, sold by Dalian gangs and others to Japanese banks for over one million yuan, was hedging Dalian drafts. It is clear that the market is volatile and unpredictable.</p>
<p>▲ British Exchange Domestic Interbank Market saw fluctuations of 25 points. The bid price in the early market was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0625 points, and the buying price was 125 to 1875 points.

<p>▲ Market Overview: Yesterday, the silver dollar market maintained a stable appearance. There were no slight increases or decreases in prices in the morning or afternoon. On the surface, it was quite stable and impeccable. However, internally, the financial community, aware of the recent decline in various securities, was quite worried. Generally, conservative factions mostly waited and watched, not daring to engage in speculative trading. Therefore, the joys and sorrows of this year's financial community are quite disparate.</p>
<p>▲ Call Loan Prices (Silver Dollar): The call loan price in the morning and afternoon was the same, at 7 qian, 2 fen, 5 li, 1 hao, 2 hu, and a half, the same as the previous day's price.

Copper coins were reduced by 1,000 wen, to 371,000 wen.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Securities and Bonds Continue to Fall by About One Yuan <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Selling Remains Strong, Market Conditions Continue to be Lively</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond fluctuations, although the market took advantage of the low prices to buy in, were still not quiet. There were also many short positions being covered. However, since market sentiment remained weak, large investors mostly leaned towards selling, and some parties continued to sell off. Selling transactions were still far more active than buying transactions. Therefore, all prices became even weaker, continuing to fall across the board compared to the previous day. Although the situation once became slightly firmer in the afternoon, judging from the closing situation, the trend still seemed quite sluggish. As a result, compared to the previous day, the 20-year rolled futures and the 1928 Customs October issue both fell by 1 yuan and 78 jiao, and most others also fell by about 1 yuan. Only the consolidated tax fell by a small 67 jiao, and the 96 issue fell slightly by several jiao, it was said. The total volume of futures reached 22.7 million, it was said.</p>

<p>The yarn market was dull and unremarkable, with no signs of revival. The situation was very sluggish, with no vitality. Both long and short positions were strongly held. The overseas flower and yarn situation was also calm, but there was still a lack of the large trading volume actually needed in the market. Currently, it is still stuck in a revolving situation. Without special circumstances, it is difficult to trigger new changes.</p>
<p>▲ Bidding Lacking: At the opening of the bidding market, although American cotton rose, there were not many buyers in the market, and the situation was rather lackluster. Prices for each month fell slightly by 2, 3, 4, and 5 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price was high again, and prices for each month rebounded by 2, 3, and 5 qian. The transaction statistics totaled 15,350 bales. Sales totaled 1,100 bales excluding the same. Gengfeng had 790 bales, Shenchang had 650 bales, and Dafu had 800 bales. Purchases totaled 700 bales for Dalong, 600 bales for Taishengkang, 600 bales for Changfeng, 500 bales for Yichang, and 400 bales for Rongxing. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>January 151.0 Down 1 95,950 February 151.0 Down 1 38,000</p>
<p>▲ Yarn Sales Flat: The sales of current yarn are still flat. Statistics show that various merchants bought a total of 900 bales throughout the day, and other merchants purchased 1,150 bales. The market was flat. Merchants from the mainland purchased 200 bales, Tianjin purchased 55 bales, Sichuan purchased 350 bales, Jiangxi purchased 55 bales, northern merchants purchased 30 bales, and miscellaneous merchants purchased 150 bales. Japanese factories opened with 20 counts of Blue Phoenix Hongxi at 170 taels, totaling 3,600 bales, from January to March. In addition, 20 counts of Blue Phoenix were at 160 taels plus tax, 9,000 bales, from April to June, all accepted by foreign firms and merchants, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Cotton Market Stable <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The American cotton situation is slightly stable, but the exchange rate is loose, so it is still difficult to arouse the interest of bulls. Moreover, the Japanese firm Dongmian bought a batch of Indian cotton, and the long position in standard cotton was mostly sold off, so the market remained soft. However, the amount absorbed by the Han gang and cotton merchants remained stable. In the afternoon, the gold price rebounded again, causing morale to rise slightly. Judging from the overall trend, there is a deep fear of a situation of strong opposition.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Slightly Brisk: At the opening of the Han standard, the market was slightly tight due to the rebound of foreign cotton. Later, the gold market was still not good and loosened again. As a result, it rose by 1 qian. In the afternoon, the market was still rising, and the gold price was firm. Prices for each month rose by 5 fen to 1 qian. The transaction statistics totaled 39,200 dan. Sales totaled 4,600 dan for Changfeng, 1,700 dan for Yichang, and 1,100 dan for Changji. Purchases totaled 1,000 dan for Gongtai, 1,200 dan for Shenchang, 3,800 dan for Yuande, 1,500 dan for Xinfeng, and 2,700 dan for Jifeng. The closing prices are recorded on the left.

<p>▲ American Cotton Rebound: Yesterday, the American cotton market was firm. Initially, it was weak due to favorable harvest conditions, but later it was firm due to industry buying and short covering. Futures rose by 17 to 19 points, and spot goods rose by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 9 to 10 points, and spot goods fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 10 points. Indian cotton was calm and stable due to local short covering and Japanese purchases. Pingle fell by 0.5 rupees, Omla fell by 2.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (September 9th telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e188">Grain Rice Market Below the River Continues to Fall <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>▲ Southern Market: Yesterday, the source of various gangs turned sparse, but the Pu stock was not weak. Sales in urban and rural stores were sluggish, and people only selected and bargained for prices. This is because the weather is hot and humid, and the market feels increasingly declining. The japonica rice was cut by 1 chi, and the thin rice accumulated goods were not loose, and the stomach was spared from being dull. This street used cheap new japonica rice, and Song goods continued to arrive, and the sales market inevitably suffered squeezing, resulting in fewer transactions, and the market price was also short of angular allowance. Although there are not many Lu Yang sharp goods, the consumption is also thin, and the shape is tired and falling, and the variable yuan has no goods available for the market.</p>
<p>▲ New Zha got few heads and went to zero and scattered, with the top middle two grades being the most popular. The store party purchased accumulated goods with the change of seasons, and the market was limited to ups and downs. Few people asked about thick japonica rice such as Wuxi, Liyang, and Jiangyin. Large plates raised the killing price. New japonica rice and new sharp arrivals were slightly available. The Riverstock and rice mills still had inventory, and the situation was reduced by 2 jiao. There was a slight opening of foreign Lu tip and glutinous rice, and the price was still stable.</p>

<p>Foreign Telegram Reports a Rise of 2 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was generally weak, because even Japanese customers had no giant stomachs, and people unanimously hoped for a small price, and the cargo owners were even more anxious to sell. Retailers and hoarders in this street took this opportunity to press prices and buy. The total market transaction of Taizhou white rice was over 1,000 bags, and the price was 13 yuan, 4 jiao to 12 yuan, 9 jiao, which was 34 fen less than the previous day. Small twisted current rice was 800 bags, and the price was 13 yuan, 4 jiao, 3 fen to 4 jiao, which was about a small recent jiao. Small twisted September was 200 tons, and the price was 6 taels, 3 qian, which was 2 jiao and 4 fen more. Only the Min Party rice had a village-to-village route, and 100 bags were purchased, and the price was 13 yuan, 2 jiao, which was 2 jiao more than the last sale, it was said.</p>
<p>Due to the reported rise in production areas, there were no new foreign transactions. Yesterday's telegrams reported that each rice was about 2 jiao higher than the market price.</p>

<p>— Wen Qing</p>
<p>I used to hear that natives in the tropics catch live snakes in their hands, bite off their heads in one bite, then bite them off section by section, slowly swallowing them, with a taste like we have when eating sugarcane and sweet rice stalks. After I arrived in a country below the equator, I really wanted to see them enjoying this kind of tasty delicacy, but I never saw it once. Perhaps it's because I didn't go to visit deep in the mountains and valleys.</p>
<p>Originally, in the tropics, news of people eating snakes and snakes eating people could often be heard. Even the shepherds and woodcutters near volcanoes sometimes went out in the morning and never returned in the evening. Some people said they were eaten by tigers, others said they were eaten by snakes. According to experienced hunters with knowledge of animal behavior, if a tiger eats a person, human hands and feet can be found in the forest or on the hillside, because tigers eat people but don't eat hands and feet, just as people eat chicken eggs but don't eat eggshells. Based on this formula, it can be inferred that those people were eaten by snakes. But I always had some disbelief. How could such a long body and small head and neck swallow a person? Because the snakes I often saw on the roads lined with tall green trees, green branches, and fresh grass were just big snakes. There were long ones, short ones, thick ones, thin ones, blue, red, purple, green, all sorts of colors of snakes, flattened by the洋鬼子's cars, sleeping on the road with blurred bloodstains. The street cleaners in red vests dragged the snakes, one by one, like dead eels, to the garbage bin every morning. It can be imagined that there are many snakes in the tropics.</p>
<p>One day, a friend who grew up in the tropics was talking to me about hygiene issues. I always felt that the natives were not very particular about hygiene. No, it was the same for some of the overseas Chinese. They liked to sleep on damp ground and liked to eat stale meat, so they were often prone to illness, and people died more frequently and quickly. Diseases enter through the mouth. First and foremost, I advocate eating fresh things.</p>
<p>(In the tropics, to avoid the occurrence of strange diseases, it is not advisable to eat too much meat and fish. If you must eat it, you should eat fresh and lively ones.)</p>
<p>(Can you eat live animals? Unless you are a snake.)</p>
<p>(Of course, they are killed and cooked thoroughly, and eaten when they are fragrant. Don't snakes also kill animals and eat them?)</p>
<p>(Yes, snakes swallow animals whole and alive. It seems you are still not as hygienic as a snake.)</p>

<p>— Bing She</p>
<p>"How do you know that snakes swallow live animals?"</p>
<p>(My aunt's family lives by hunting. I don't know how many wild animals they have at home now. A week ago, my uncle caught a big snake on a high mountain next to a volcano. It was as thick as a water bucket and more than fifty feet long. He was going to sell it to the zoo. It is still in a sturdy iron cage. It has a large appetite and eats two wild boars and one wolf every day. One day, my cousin killed a deer on the mountain, dragged it back, and put it in the cage to feed it. Not only did it not eat it, but it was very angry. It twisted its tail and knocked the dead deer into the corner of the iron cage. If a live animal is put in, it will wag its head and tail to show how happy</p>
