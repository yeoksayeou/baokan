<p>時評</p>
<h3>緊急之民食問題（三）</h3>
<p>治標方法旣如昨評所述。治本則復何如。請更言之。</p>
<p>一曰整頓水利也。農　田收穫。端賴水利。但水多則潦。水少則旱。我國江河交流。綜錯全國。然而水利不修。常年旣少蒙其益。一遇久雨。則泛濫成災。如黃河河道淤塞。遷徒無常。沿河兩岸。無日不處於洪水威脅之下。尤以北方各地。雨水稍多。即成澤國。一遇亢旱。即赤地千里。政府雖已有治河導淮等委員會之設立。但後者有計劃而無切實之工作。前者更僅具空名。夫水本有利。而如何以收其利。則在人爲。故今後水利機關。於整頓江河水利。應精詳計劃。切實工作。防其害固宜注意。求其利尤爲要圖。如今日利旣未得。害亦未防。江河蕩蕩。適爲禍水。得母貽世界各國之竊笑。二曰撫輯流亡也。連年以來。天災人禍。相洊而來。東南西北。民苦顚連。壯者流離四方。老弱餓斃溝壑。農皆離田。田荒乃多。陜甘一帶。荒蕪千里。湘贛匪區。尤多荒廢。民食因之日蹙。故今後政府亟應籌集專欵。統籌荒區。招撫流離。貸予資金。更提倡組織農業合作。俾能集力互助。庶荒蕪可復。民食可增。三曰改良農業方法也。我國農民。智識過低。農作方法。都墨守前軌。不知應用科學。改進方法。種子不知選擇。幼苗不知培養。病虫不知防除。收穫後更不知善爲貯藏。以加倍之人工。換來和量之收。穫。亦爲民食荒歉之一因。故今後實業部應切實研究改良農業方法。敎育農民。以增加農業上之生産。四曰改良農具也。舊有農具。率皆笨拙。需工旣多。收效尤鮮。今後政府宜倣效各國已有之新式農具。設廠製造。如刈麥機·打榖機·抽水機·播種機·中耕器·等普遍推廣。使農民得利用機械力量。增加生産食糧作物之功能。以上四者。皆爲治本之要道。其他方法猶多。容後續談。</p>

<h3>南滿鐵道槪論（彬）（三）（續）</h3>
<p>（丁）鐵道之軍事作用　目前日本正積極致力於吉會路之實現。假如吉會路一旦實現。則無異於我東北死刑之宣告。田中義一曾有言。「至欲行明治大帝第三期遺策（即滅亡東北）時。則以福岡廣島二地之國軍。（日軍）由朝鮮入南滿。以制支那軍之北上。以名古屋關西地方之國軍取敦賀海路。而進清津。經吉會路而入北滿。另以關東地方之國軍。由新瀉出港。直至情津或羅津。仍依吉會路而猛進北滿地方。另以北海道仙台名地之國軍。由靑森及函館二港出口。而急進鹽浦。占領西比利亞路。以直達北滿哈爾濱。而南迫奉天。并占領蒙古等地。同時又可阻止俄軍之南下。終則與關西軍福岡廣島軍三面會合。分派爲兩大軍。南則把守山海關。以防支那軍北上。北則把守齊齊哈爾。以阻俄軍南下。則滿蒙之食料原料。皆可聽我自由取用。雖戰十年。我亦無食料原料不足之憂也。</p>
<p>據此則南滿鐵路之軍事價值。蓋可想知。現雖吉會路未得實現。但其距離至爲有限。形勢更爲可慮。而安奉路直與朝鮮相接。軍事上之作用。已不可否認。其目前給予我國及未來之迫害。更覺令人心悸。</p>
<p>（戊）士地之收買　滿鐵會社常貸予韓人以資金。令其向我國農民租買土地。間接入於彼手。即强行霸佔。不許贖回。</p>
<p>（己）積極之移民　日人藉南滿路便利。積極向我移民。截至目前約共有二十萬餘人。而韓民之移來。則更多至二百餘萬。（請參閱拙著韓僑移殖東北之研究一文）此種殖民政策。更給予我東北以無窮之迫害。</p>
<p>就上述經濟的政治的兩方面而言。則滿鐵實足以亡我東北而有餘。孫中山先生更有言。「日本在十天之内。即可以亡中國。」其危我之程度有如此者。國人再不急謀自衛。茫茫前途。即爲絶境。時危勢蹙。國人其急起直追。</p>
<h3>（六）目前之鐵道協商及如</h3>
<h3>何溣收回南滿鐵道</h3>
<p>準上所述。南滿鐵道對於我國之迫害。已可知其大槪。我東北當局欲抗制日人之鐵道政策。必以完成我國自有鐵道網系爲根本要圖。故近年以來。對於鐵道網系之計劃與進行。不遺餘力。鐵道網系之計劃。主要者爲東西兩大幹綫。東大幹綫。由綏遠起經同江·伊蘭·五常·吉林·海龍·瀋陽·打虎山而至葫蘆島。此外尙計劃有若干培養綫。此綫及支綫如成。則（一）東省東部一帶之富源。可歸我國吸收。（二）衝破日本豫定之國防得心。（三）平分天圖鐵道及清津港之繁榮。（四）内地移民可以直接輸送至延邊一帶。於我國防上及經濟上都有絶大之利益。西大幹綫。由葫蘆島起經打虎山至通遼爲南段。通遼至洮南（尙未成功）爲中段。由洮安至克山泰安等地爲北段。尙計劃有若干培養綫。此綫現未竣工者。僅通遼至洮南一段。將來全幹綫及其培養綫完成。則（一）戰時日本預定之軍營駐紮地如興安嶺·開魯·洮安一帶。皆被衝破。（二）東省北部之富源全被吸收。（三）歐美東洋之水陸交通大動脈。將歸我有。其於我國防上及交通上亦至關重要。以此兩大幹綫爲網羅。而以葫蘆島爲出口。更計劃闢秦皇島以爲補助。就我政治·經濟·國防·人口·貿易·交通而言。皆爲緊急之對策。皆爲切實之要圖。然而日人於此。則眼紅心慌。如芒在背。朝野上下。奔走駭汗。一若大難之即將來臨者。至於。般軍閥政客。則更肆其無理之謬論。一致主張積極干涉我國之交通行政。一則曰滿鐵受難·由於我國鐵道之威脅。再則曰我違背條約。甚且主張積極以武力佔據我東北。終至日政府調任外交能手田内康哉爲滿鐵總裁。任命木村爲鐵道協商代表。一以整頓滿鐵。一以對我東北作鐵道之協商。日人此次　商鐵道之目的。大抵仍不外乎歷年來對我攫取新路權。完成東南兩路。并阻撓我鐵道網系計劃之實現之故智。就此次木村氏所提出之。（一）平行綫問題。（二）借欵問題。（三）履行築路協商問題。（四）改定運價問題四案觀之。即爲確證。而履行築路協定一案之提出。則尤重在吉會路之完成。綜計自前清光緒三十一年至民國十八年共二十五年内。兩國間爲東北鐵道問題所引起之交涉。共四十三次。而每一次交涉。我國無不處於失敗地位。往者已矣。來者可追。羊羣雖亡。補牢尙有可救。是則此次鐵道協商。我國人亟應合全力共謀對付。毋再令日人制我最後之死命。</p>
<p>現滿鐵會社在内田視事之初。已大事改革·集中全部勢力於我瀋陽。并决由總裁處理外交事務。内田本爲日本外交界斵輪老手。此次毅然以滿鐵交涉置於其鐵腕之下。其重視此次協商及努力發展滿鐵侵略使命之决心。具可想見。是則未來歲月。尤不容吾人樂觀與偷閑。（此節請參閱拙著東北中日鐵道協商之重大性一文）。</p>
<p>國人對於東北之鐵道問題。目前頗多注意。而對於如何抗制日本之鐵道政策。亦有不少宏言讜論。無容贅論。著者特提出如何準備收回南滿鐵道一點。以爲本文之結束。</p>
<p>按帝俄之建築東省鐵路。爲根據一八九六年（光緒二十二年八月二十七日清俄合訂之東清鐵道合同）。該合同最末一條（第十二條）有云。</p>
<p>「自該公司路成開車之日起。以八十年爲限。所有鐵路所得利益。全歸公司專得。如有虧折。該公司亦應自行彌補。中國政府不能作保。八十年限滿之日。所有鐵路及鐵路一切産業。全歸中國政府。毋庸給價。又從開車之日起。三十六年後。中國政府有權可給價收回。按計所用本銀並因此路所欠債項並利息照數償還。其公司所賺之利。除分給各股東外。如有贏餘。應作爲已歸之本。在收回路價内扣除。中國政府應將價欵付存俄國國家銀行。然後收管此路。……」</p>
<p>據此條規定。則東省鐵路自開車日起八十年後。我國應無條件的收回。自開車日起三十六年後。我國可以隨時備價贖回。明文規定。蓋毫無疑義。</p>
<p>東省鐵路南滿支綫（即南滿鐵路）爲根據一八九八年（光緒二十四年）三月十五日清俄會訂條約而建築。該條約之第八欵有云。</p>
<p>「中國政府允以光緒二十二年所准東省鐵路公司建造鐵路之理。而今自畫比約日起。推及由該幹路某一站起至大連灣。……築一支路。所有光緒二十二年八月初二日中國政府與華俄銀行所立合同内各例。宜於以上所續支路確切照行。……」</p>
<p>根據此欵。則南滿洲支路之可於開車八十年後無條件收回。或三十六年後備欵贖回。應與東省鐵道同。</p>
<p>日人之有南滿洲支路。係根據樸茨茅斯和約之讓予。及中日滿洲善後協約之承認而確立。中日滿洲善後協約僅於第一條中載有「中國政府承認日俄媾和條約第五條與第六條俄國讓予日本之各項」。而在第二條中則更明白規定「日本政府承認遵行中俄兩國締結之租借地及築造鐵道諸條約。……」是則南滿洲支路。是經我承認俄國之讓予日本。但建築鐵路合同之實質。則絶未改變。其能於八十年後由我國無條件收回。或三十六年後備價贖回。應亦牢如鐵案。</p>
<p>在此。日人或引廿一條中展南滿鐵路租期至九十九年爲口實。但此亡國之廿一條。我國民根本未予承認。亦絶不能承認。日人决不能恃爲根據。</p>
<p>總之上述各種合同及條約。皆爲侵犯我主權之不平等條約。爲收回我主權計。對於此種不平等條約。自應完全廢棄。就南滿鐵路建築時條約而言。固可收回。就廢除不平等條約。收回我主權言。更應收回。獨立國家主權神聖。爲任何國家所不能侵犯。日人决無理由可以阻撓我收回南滿鐵路。况東省鐵路。我國刻正與蘇聨交涉收回。南滿爲東省之一部。其可能收回。尤爲毫無疑義。</p>
<p>滿鐵之應收回與可能收回已毫無疑義矣。此後之問題。僅在於如何準備收回。著者以爲應</p>
<p>（一）先期照會日本政府。廢除日本在東北一切不平等條約。定期收回南滿鐵路。</p>
<p>（二）組織收回南滿鐵路委員會。研究一切備價評價等問題。</p>

<h3>對萬鮮兩案之謬論</h3>
<p>政友會森恪氏在安東之表示</p>

<p>森恪氏又對往訪者、謂余（森恪自稱）非故意與民政黨爲難、今日之事實、實令余如此、試觀日俄戰後二十餘年之歷史、日本之重大建設、均出自政友會、今日民政黨二度更迭、根本方針之更改、何止千百次、吾人固渴望彼等因方針更改之結果、足以有良好之功績昭示吾人、孰知揆之事實、恰得其反、實令吾人痛心、試就幣原之外交論、其懦弱之狀態、不僅對於事實受有不少之損害、且有損於吾日本帝國之威名、觀萬寳山事件、僅派「警官」數名、若比諸田中内内閣之濟南出兵、相去何止天壤云云、觀此、足見日人對滿蒙之侵略、益露骨矣、（八月六日）</p>

<p>繼續進發由沙漠直達哈密</p>
<p>中法學術考察團、因團員在中途發生爭執、而華團員郝景盛、又被毆於法團長卜安、於是牽涉於侮辱國體問題、而國内人士激於愛國思潮、又以巴黎有黃種巡察團之舉、因之對此益爲不滿、但華方團長褚民誼、雖屢有來電、始而主張退出、繼又報告糾紛已經解决、但其糾紛之發生與解决之辦法若何、外間尙未知悉、昨某要人已接到褚函、詳細報告此事之經過、原文如下、「自行抵百靈廟寄上一信、至今已一閱月矣、途中雖極勞苦、而已於六月十五日安抵酒泉、到後與法方交涉、曾致中央及由古物保管委員會轉法使兩電、想已見諸報載、今日與法方交涉、尙稱圓滿、故又電中央及法使、報告雙方糾紛、已圓滿解决、定明晨六時西進、但决定不走安西、而仍走沙漠同睇而西、直達哈密、此次中法間糾紛之起、其近因在郝景盛君、東日在Hoyomoto卜被安君毆辱、而毆辱之原因、一則中潜習慣不同、一旦同作長途旅行、容易有發生意氣口角之可能、據德日進（北平地質學敎士同行之一）言、上次法人在非洲旅行中、亦有自相衝突之事、何况中法人士同行、有語言不同（郝君不懂法語）性情不同等等原因、隨時可以發生糾紛、二則沙漠中之生活、肉體上之苦楚、亦最易惹起神經奮發、稍一不忍、即怒動而不可遏、故當郝君被卜安毆辱前、二君正在口角時、弟勸之、而郝君即駡弟爲亡國奴、弟不答而避其怒、故卜安毆郝君時、弟已離塲矣、郝君固不免失之粗魯、而被打於外人之手、弟雖被駡、其亦何忍、且當時郝君在沙漠中、與周君寳韓退出、未得郝周二君由包頭來電（六月十四日發二十日在此收到）之前、深慮二君生死未卜、故有致法使電中云云、今郝周二君早抵北平、或則二君以爲弟置此事不理、不知弟到肅州後、即開六人會議、投票决進退者適半、（主退而東返者焦劉褚主進而西行者姚楊鄭）繼續討論、時鄭君亦願與弟同東返、於是决與法方脫離、一面電中央請示、一面請當地馬師長勸法人暫留於此、不准發無線電、於是潜大窘、自稱俘虜、而實際馬師長甚厚待法人、弟等告彼、以弟等去電中央請示、中央未來電以前、弟等暫留、而法人急急欲行、又不得馬師長步芳之許可、法人恐嚇馬師長、而弟等願負完全之責、函馬師長數法人違反中法合作之罪、法人前進、而弟等不前進、馬師長以爲弟等不行、當然不讓法人獨行、故將此意告法人、於是法人大悟、當面道歉、重訂繼續合作條例七條、其主要之點、（一）撤去卜安而以蒲魯爾Burll代之、（裴文明向焦績華道歉、此事未在條例中、）（二）以前之糾紛、在途中不再提及、保留他日返北平交涉、（三）中法合作、凡有一方不能入新疆境者、雙方均不入境、（四）無線電之收發、各電公佈、凡有電局之處、不得用無線電等七條、原文另抄、法人均答允、雙方六人簽字、於是繼續合作、定明晨西進、繞安西而直赴哈密、</p>

<h3>納稅會反對估價徵捐</h3>
<p>再度正告工部局</p>
<p>上海租界納稅華人會、昨致函公共租界工部局代理總辦麥基云、逕啟者、准七月三十日第一零九八號惠覆、爲對於有實在房租之市政總捐、其收取方法、仍堅持破壞歷來善良之習慣由、查惠覆末段含意、對於此種高估房租之繳捐辦法、貴局認爲絶無變更之餘地、但本會以貴局爲納稅人所組織之自治機關、絶不願貴局之措施、於納稅人之志願有所差異、現本會仍須以下述理由、特請貴局注意、並取消此種曲解條文與變相之增捐辦法、（一）現在市政總捐之捐率、爲房租百分之一四、倘使有實在房租可爲標準之市政總捐、可不以實在房租計算、而任意照估計房租計算、則以前之增加捐率、如由百分之一四增至爲百分之一六、實爲多事、祇須將實在房租增高二成可矣、按增加捐率、必須經納稅人同意、係公共租界所實行自治原則下之法律行爲、設使市政總捐對於有實在房租、可要根據而不根據、得另行估出高於實在房租之數目、以爲標準、則此後增捐、完全可全操於財務處之扖納稅人得用何法以制裁之乎、增加捐率、增加納稅人之負担也、超出實在房租標準而徵捐、亦增加納稅人之負担也、譬如實在房租、按月爲銀一百兩、其市政總捐按百分之一四計算、爲銀十四兩、今將每月實在房租銀一百兩、估爲銀一百九十兩、按百分之一四計算、爲銀二十六兩六錢、其爲加捐、實質同於增加捐率、且更可隨意、此種變相加捐之行爲、能爲自治原則下納稅人所許可乎、所以本會爲維持自治與法治兩原則、不得不諄諄告誡者也、（二）現行之地産章程、訂於何時、有書可據、茲不釐述、當日公共租界内之房屋情形何若、就事實所指示、當日之出租房屋、可稱絶鮮、大都係己産自用、在此情形下、採用英國房捐制度、自不得不行使估租之一法、因别無實在房租、可資爲標準故也、地産章程之如此規定、正如其他法規、根據現狀而産生、有同一之原因、苟不其然、則現行地産之章程施行後、市政總捐捐率、不必有如費唐法官報告書内第一卷第一四七至一四八面表中所列之變化、儘可高估假定房租、而仍可維持一八六六年所用對於外人百分之五、及對於華人百分之八之捐率矣、（三）公平爲現代公共機關存在之基礎、如欲將其某種義務或權利、給與極少數之納稅人負担或享受、此乃專制獨裁之下如此、而謂已代表法治制度、自譽爲全體納稅人所組織之自治機關、所能容許、或作爲此種不公平之行動乎、本會正告貴局、以自治法治公平原則言、應即令飭財務處長、停止此項藉以規避納稅人同意權行使之變相加捐方法、蓋此種舉動、實係玩文弄法之行爲、殊不光明正大也、正辦理間、據上海中國化學工業社等函開、敝社等於本日（六日）致上海公共租界工部局一函云、「逕復者、接奉貴局一零九八號公函内稱、敝租河南路四四四號及四四五號房租、各佔爲按月銀一百六十兩云云、查本案要點、在納稅人之公平待遇、與不得借估高房租手段實行增加捐率、並非估租高低問題、貴局對於上述要點、不加尊重庆敝公司不能開此玙２例、所有此項加增房捐、實屬碍難遵納、相應提出抗議等語「、特此錄請查照等語、本會認爲殊屬合理、相應函達、希煩查照辦理爲荷、</p>
<p>威升觸礁後</p>
<h3>又遭海盜刦掠</h3>
<p>被難員客將來滬</p>
<p>怡和洋行威升輪、在福州洋面遇大風、因避風而在南灣觸礁、船身毁壞、旅客救起、船員一人落海死亡、已誌本報、茲悉該輪于失事後、又遭海盜刦掠、損失巨大、亟將續得消息、分記如下、</p>
<p>罼艦救護搭客　威升輪當觸礁時、船上無綫電、已被風浪摧毁、電機失其效用、求救之電、無法發出、而輪底已經套進暗礁内、水入大艙、船主乃改用火箭求救、此際正舉風大浪激、無船經行、幸有外國軍艦一艘、自厦門海　開出、瞥見求救信號、即駛往助救、當因輪底已破不能拖曳、乃放舢輪前往、將救出員客、轉登恒生輪、送來上海、昨得確訊、恒生輪已在途中、如果今日午後不及至滬、將於明晨進口、</p>
<p>海盜刦掠財物　威升失事處、正在海島之麓、爲海盜出没淵藪、在軍艦救去船員旅客後、海盜即放舢板划子、冒險至威升船内、將船員旅客等所遺行李財物等项、肆行刧掠、凡可以携取者、統被海盜刦取上船、在驚風駭濤之中、滿載贓物而逸、及至該軍艦將救出員客轉過恒生、復返前往保護時、則海盜已飽掠　逃矣、聞船内值錢之物、多遭刦去、公私損失、至爲巨大、現由該艦監護、以防再刦、</p>
<p>買辦助手死亡　據昨得消息、威升船内落海身死船員、並非買辦、係買辦助手、姓名尙待調查、至于被難情形、須俟救出員各到滬後、方能明瞭也、至威升輪底、已爲礁石撞破、各艙均浸水、幸擱在礁石之上、故猶未完全沉失也、但殊少拖救希望、香港總行、巳派員至失事地點勘騐、能否拖曳、須候查看之人回報以後、方能確定、各艙貨物、大都漫浸在海水中、能否卸駁一部、亦無把握、該輪由港來滬後、原擬再往天津、故船内裝赴之北洋貨居多、又據滬航界言、今次浙閩海面大風、失事之輪、僅此威升一船、甚屬該行之不幸、該輪保有平安險、在公司方面所受損失、故無多云、</p>
<h3>市府减徵市政經費</h3>
<p>市土地局、自發行不動産契紙後、即照向例征收不動産轉移稅及市政經費不動産轉移稅、舊稱契稅、市政經費、舊稱契紙附捐、此項附捐、包括保衛團經費、敎育費、戶籍費、警察費、自治費、救火會經費、前縣知事公署之馬巡費、契紙發行所之辦公費在内、各區征收數目、多寡不等、爲由立契時繳納、由各區契納發行所塡給收據、嗣該局以各區帶征、數目參差不齊、同屬一市之下、人民負担、不應輕重不均、經於十九年五月間、呈准照契價、每百元一律征收五元、即凡遇不動産轉移、於立契時、照契價每百元征收市政經費五元、於完稅時、照契價每日元征收不動産轉移稅八元、每契價百元、兩共征銀十三元、經此次整理之後、較上寳兩縣已覺減輕甚鉅、最近張市長爲再求减輕人民負担起見、經諭知土地局、對於本市不動産轉移稅、認爲人民負担仍覺太大、飭即研究辦法、酌予减輕、土地局奉諭後、經即詳加研究、擬將向照契價征收百分之五之市政經費、减爲百分之一、此一成仍照向例、撥充各區契紙分發行所經費、業經呈由市政府、提交市政會議曁建設討論委員會、照案通過矣、</p>

<h3>席裕全律師被控</h3>
<h3>亂倫姦汚案</h3>
<p>原告爲其從妹席淑蘭</p>
<p>謂十六歲被席破貞操</p>
<p>化名赴蘇州醫院生子</p>
<p>侵佔金飾一匣不交還</p>
<p>律師席裕全、字麟心、江蘇常熟人、原籍住處爲小榆樹頭、近爲其從妹席淑蘭（二十五歲）延徐祖燕律師控於特區第一法院、請治以刑法二百四十條第一項二百四十三條第二欵監護人保佐人對其所監護保佐之未滿十六歲女子强姦、依强姦本刑加重三分之一及同法二百二十四條僞造文書罪三百五十六條侵占等罪、業由法院准詞出票、飭捕金萬榮傳知兩造屆時到廷候訊、茲覓錄原告訴狀於下、</p>
<p>老父病重托孤　狀爲誘姦被監護血親、侵吞監護財物、訴請拘究判懲、并令賠償損失事、緣自訴人淑蘭、爲被告席裕全之從妹、裕全故父斐章公與先父君唐公爲兄弟行、民國五年舊歷三月初五日、先父考終於原籍南市里舊宅、時距先母之殁、僅隔一年、遺孤四人、均屬幼稚、自訴人最小、年甫九齡、其餘胞兄三人、皆不過十有餘歲、先父病中自知不起、深恐身後遺孤、乏人撫養、特於二月間、邀請親長屈少卿·族妹席葆時·曁大伯妣丁氏·二伯考斐章·齊集病榻、托付後事、除胞兄三人分别托人監護、并將田宅等不動産分給承受、立有遺囑、</p>
<p>裕全繼承監護　嗣後復商允斐章公、擔任自訴人之監護責作墌並以金飾一匣、約計重二十四兩有零、（品名另詳清單）遺贈自訴人、指定備作長大出閣之需、當時在塲親長、莫不聞知、因此自訴人失怙之第簱即由伯妣丁氏送交斐章收養、遺贈金飾、亦一併交與保管、荏苒數年、不幸丁氏斐章、相繼去世、被告裕全、乃繼厥考而任監護自訴人之責、所有監護財物、亦因之入其掌握、</p>
<p>十六歲時失身　詎裕全起意鯨吞、不願自訴人長而有家、致耗奩資、遂乘自訴人年十六知識未充之際、日施游辭艶語、輔以媚態令色、爲種種之勾引、自訴人初解情愛、罔知禮敎、遂墮術中、致被裕全破壞童貞、成爲終身之玷、</p>
<p>伴往蘇州分娩　延至前年十一月間、自訴人孕己足月、裕全恐在家分娩、必爲鄰里所駭異、爰於同月二十六日、親伴自譤认到蘇、投至維達醫院、化名張師母、由裕全親書入院生産志願書、賃居第二十四號病室候産、住院月餘、始於十二月十九日生一男、裕全乘自訴人坐褥昏迷之際、抱去寄養、迄今不明所在、</p>
<p>金飾絶口不承　産後回籍、裕全初尙照常相待、嗣忽漸露厭惡之意、迭加詬誶、終竟迫令離鄉、自覓生活、自訴人亦知久寄籬下、終非了局、惟欲獨立生活、必須顧及經濟、遂不得不向其索還遺贈金飾、裕全竟絶口不承、轉稱自訴人揑詞訛詐、自訴人乃愬諸親族、羣爲不平、</p>
<p>聨合家人兇毆　其後被告亦知一手難掩衆目、乃託族兄承若、出面調停、願給千金、脫離監護關係、自訴人因與遺贈財物、相去懸殊、不肯遽允、被告竟啟惡念、必欲自訴人不安於居、遂於本年一月間、聨合家人、實施兇毆、幸未傷及要害、尙克保全生命、</p>
<p>飾詞答復之言　自訴人自遭此辱點、念不如且避爲佳、乃由蘇而滬、託律師去函詰問、詎被告飾詞答復、揑稱自訴人係先父收養之道旁棄兒、後因不守家規、致遭驅逐、遂在外浮蕩、不知與何人姦通成孕、致有私赴醫院秘密生産之舉、今乃自誣誣人、希圖索詐、無恥已極等語、</p>
<p>揑造族妹僞函　同時並揑造族妹葆時名義之僞函、寄與律師、力爲自己掩飾、伏思自訴人爲先父君唐公之親女、闔族莫不知之、詎容被告信口誣衊、倘自訴人果係道旁棄兒、斐章又未肥託監護、則被告及其故父何肯於收養人故後、不惜衣食將自訴人鞠養成長、於此已足知其爲飾說、</p>
<p>族妹深知眞相　先父病中遺贈金飾於自訴人、託由斐章保管、有當時同受顧託之親族目覩、何能任意抹煞、雖多數親族、現均下世、無從取徵、然幸尙有族妹葆時健存、自可訉得眞相、若謂葆時於此事並無所聞、則被告又何必冒其名義、揑造復函、於此更可見被告之僞、</p>
<p>醫院親筆願書　至云自訴人係與他人姦姘成孕、果屬實在、則被告勢必以貽羞門楣、實行驅逐、安肯不避嫌疑、伴送至蘇、陪入醫院、親塡志願書乎、此事旣有助産之維達醫院院長目覩可憑、又有被告留院之親筆願書可稽、應請調案查閱、常庭核對筆跡、是否出於被告之手、自不難一鞫而明、他如揑造葆時私函、不但其筆跡與被告復函相同、且經葆時來函聲明、證據極爲確鑿、</p>
<p>時常到滬盤桓　被告向在上海、執行律師職務、設事務所於威海衛路、時携自訴人來滬盤桓、在所同人、孰不知之、茲乃誣自訴人潛逃已久、詎不有違眞實、似此身充律師、以保障人權維護法治爲職責、允宜如何守法自愛、乃竟不顧倫常、誘姦被監護之未滿十六歲弱妹、先旣汚其貞操、後復吞其財物、終且揑造足生損害於人之信函、以掩飾其罪恶、</p>
<p>請求從重科刑　綜上所陳實已觸犯刑法第二百四十條第一項·第二項·第二百四十三條第二欵·第三百五十二條第一項·第二百二十四條·之罪、爲此依據刑事訴訟法第十三條（所在地）第三百三十七條各欵·第五百零六條、具狀訴請鈞院鑒核、俯准將被告拘案律辦、從重科刑、以爲亂倫滅紀者儆、一面判令被告返還吞没之金飾二十四兩零、或賠償相當之金價、俾自訴人生活有資、免成餓莩、從此棲跡空門、懺悔餘生、冀圖晚蓋於萬一、則銜戴鴻慈於無旣矣、並附帶請求傳證人席葆時·席承若·及維達醫院院長到案質訉、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>四種東西的發明者</p>
<p>有天倫敦市上。有一個紳士架着一副眼鏡。戴着一頂軟呢帽。裝有隻軟木塞製的假腿。微蹩着走上一輛公共馬車去。因此有一位敎育家就用作試騐學生們常識的好材料。問那眼鏡·木塞製的假腿·公共馬車·軟呢帽·四種東西。是誰發明的。</p>
<p>發明眼鏡的是　位意大利人。名亞美蒂。S·D·Armati生在十三世紀。如今悲冷翠Florence城某街中有一宅屋子。由技術家公會勒石紀念他。</p>
<p>假腿本來是不用軟木塞製的。後由一位考克博士Dr·Cork"發明用軟木塞製造。頓使殘廢的人輕便不少。不過英文軟木塞呌“Cork”。而發明者恰名Cork。雷同得太凑巧了。也許將他的名字弄錯了吧。</p>
<p>公共馬車是法蘭西的發明品。一千六百六十七年間大哲學家柏斯格氏Passcal。就有在巴黎市上行駛公共馬車的特權。但是雖說公共。當時也有限制。只許上流社會中人乘坐。兵士厮僕等是一槪拒絶的。</p>
<p>軟呢是韃靼人種所發明。已歷數千年之久。北亞洲的屋宇衣服床舖等等。差不全是用軟呢做的。</p>
<h3>隕石記異</h3>
<p>— 長生</p>
<p>民國六年。從軍嘉陵。奉命暫代閬中。僅十七日。政餘多暇。漫遊山水。是處爲正南門。封閉有年。往來者咸從東西二門出入。東門外爲大綢市塲。往年華屋連雲。比因連年戰亂。瓦礫山邱。僅於原址搭蓋棚屋以應市面。陳設之大綢。皆粗劣下品。時已近夏。選購大綢數疋。備製夏衣。出西門。不及百步。即萬源堤。此堤之建造形式。最爲奇異。順堤而下。形如魚翅。又如石級。鑿步爲梯。其長約三十里。水中有無數石製犀牛。吟風嘯月。吞吐波濤。是眞防水之利器。鬥蛟之勁敵。此處本即嘉陵江。昔在唐明皇避安祿山之亂。遠狩西蜀。曾過嘉陵江而欣賞不已。後命吳道子繪入屏風·是時隨從諸臣如杜甫等。皆流寓利州。頗有吟詠。今之石匱閣。正當萬源堤之下流。有銅製犀牛一。在閣外。閣中祀川主菩薩。少年無鬚·面目如好女子。兩題寫杜甫石匱閣詩。筆勢同黑女女傳爲何子貞書。但未具名。未敢遽定。庭後有隕星石一座。高度約二尺。手撫之微温。上刻隕石二字。並於壁上寫隕星之歷史。明崇禎十四年二月某日。有星隕于石匱閣。餘火四射。樓閣化爲灰燼。至月餘。行人無敢過者。雍正八年大水。以修堤之餘工。得建石匱閣。並以隕石置廟中。永爲紀念云。各省之隕石多矣。僅於書史見之。石均無存。惟北平之銅井。有落星石一座。據鄰近老父云。「入夜有光」。但銅井之落星石。刀削之即紛紛而落。若石匱閣之隕石。其堅硬逾於鐵。其色質異於石。雖其上鑿有隕石二字。略具形式而已。此爲親見之隕石。其石尙在閬中石匱閣。過其地者。可以親往其地。不惟山川之秀媚。古蹟之名貴。即此隕石。亦足流連永日。對岸即錦屏山。爲張道陵夫婦同日得道。拔宅飛昇之處。再過數百步。即南門。門上有聨云。「嘉陵三百里。　苑十二樓」。紀實也。</p>
<h3>奇異的婚禮</h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>英國著名攝影記者胡卜氏。在四月號倫敦書報上發表一篇「奇異的婚禮」。其中記載乃是胡卜氏旅行布扎（一種半開化的回族）時所目睹的婚禮。頗饒興趣茲迻譯如次。</p>
<p>我（作者自稱下仿此）才走進他們的村子。就感覺着一種異樣的情绪。單說他們的屋子。就和元始時代一樣。用很粗的竹子架住。離地很高。建築的材料都是草和泥。遠望宛如一個雀巢。每一個人的衣服。無論男女一律都穿一種有光彩的而且紅紅綠綠的長袍子。一直要拖到地。衣服的式樣旣不像中國人穿的那樣。也不像和尙穿的那樣。七拚八凑的也不知道他們怎麽做的。</p>
<p>恰巧我到那兒的第二天。便遇着他們舉行結婚禮。於是我得目睹一種光怪陸離的婚禮。照例外人是不許參與的。後來不知道經過多少手續。說了許多奉承他們的話。又送了不少貴重禮物。才蒙他們允許。他們的親友們至少要留在新郎家裏兩天。在這兩天内儘量的吃·喝·跳舞。好像是應得的權利一般。</p>
<p>結婚這件事。在他們看來是一生中極要緊的事。所以非常鄭重。但他們都是窮的多。析郎在結婚前。非得省吃儉用幾個月不可。臨時不夠還得借債。以作結婚的費用。而新娘雖不要借債。可是也得以伊平日節省下來的錢。供給新郎。以備萬一。</p>
<p>最使我驚奇的。乃是新娘的父親。把新娘坐在他肩上。從竹梯上一步一步的下來。而新郎攙着伊的右手。新郎只有十七歲新娘有二十歲。看他們的模樣。好像一對同胞姊弟。（因爲他們的屋子離地很高。上下非得用梯子不行）伊一點不像一般普通女子了。頭髮用一種不知名的頭飾梳成從來没有見過的樣子。嘴唇塗得像血也似的紅。眼皮塗成藍色。照他們的風俗。新娘的一雙脚怎樣也不能挨着地。在結婚的三天以内。總是坐在父親或叔父的肩上。並且也得要把眼睛閉得緊緊的。到第四天才能睜開來。不然。意外的不幸。就會降臨到這一對新夫婦身上的。</p>
<p>然後。伊父親把伊坐在一個高突的椅子上。新郎立在左邊。親友們便圍着他倆嘴裏嚷着。脚底下跳着。有如一大羣受傷的野獸。在狂嘷怒跳。於是婚禮告成。一對不相識的男女。便成爲夫妻了。</p>
<h3>上海的描寫</h3>
<p>— 渺予</p>
<p>當余初來上海時。未嘗不存熱羨。今卜居已久。始覺上海之值得咀咒。憶友人蘇鳳曾有一新體詩爲諷。其辭曰。「第一天。我見的是冗忙的人羣。第二天。我見的是跳躍的黄金。第三天。我見的是牛鬼和蛇神。以後我永不曾見過一些光明。」雖未爲詳盡之描寫。然深刻極矣。</p>
<p>上海之社會。殆爲一大游藝塲。彼社會之羣衆。皆粉墨登塲之劇人也。其所演之劇多矣。在報紙之社會新聞中。連篇累牘之紀載。皆劇本也。然而此僅爲一種滑稽之想像。事實上搬演於舞台之間銀幕之前者。固尙少見有對上海社會作透骨之描繪者。其故何耶。</p>
<p>一曰。舊之編劇者好爲浮面之觀察。譬如描寫一舞女。僅知其爲一舞女也。而不問其何以爲舞女。又如描寫一舞女之生活。僅知其廻旋於樂聲燈影之間。而不問其闰心彈淚之苦。於是隔靴搔癢。其味遂如嚼蠟。</p>
<p>一曰。舊之編劇者僅顧熱閙而不顧情節之英折。譬如描寫一舞塲。鬢影衣香。履舄交錯。此固熱闹。然而彼此起舞。毫無波瀾。試問有何意味。</p>
<p>故善編劇者。描寫不偏重於一面。情節不拘泥於一方。使劇本如火如荼。使劇情如雲如霧。使演劇者如天矯之神龍。則熱閙而曲折。又使演者得充分表現之天才。而劇本於是乎成功。</p>
<p>今日之中國電影。亦已沉浸於有聲電影之潮中。我人覩西方聲片之缺點。即在於僅願熱闹。而忽視情節。故國産聲片成功之途。必力矯此弊。近聞明星公司攝一有聲巨片。「如此天堂」。純以上海之社會爲背景。而致其宛轉之諷刺者。今此片將公映。希望其不以時下所稱「肉感」「香艶」等字樣爲觀影者所轟動。其足以使人不忍失此佳片者。則願此片之力量。能勾人自然之狂笑。致人自然之痛哭。而復令人獲得無限滿意以歸。永鐫於腦海之中。而爽然曰。「天堂如此。如此天堂。」</p>
<h3>印度遊記（七九）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>回敎大著作家木沙亞比斐。Mirza　Abullazl贈我其所著穆罕默德傳及穆氏言行錄。余藉以略知回人生活。願華人應知者。回印殊難合。而回人與華人同化甚易。吾考天方性理諸書。知回敎起源。其靜工有類於道家。其制度兵刑有類儒家。敬天法祖。剛健自强。有類黄帝開國。漢唐英主。其統御歐東中亞一二千年。至今轉盛。未易輕視也。俄化之能否行於歐洲。將視德國爲轉移。能否行於亞洲。則視回人矣。至印人情形。惟親華最熱烈。即對日人亦有三分不故心因獗隘而思占有也。中人只是一中字。能聨合佛印回三族。則亞洲易聨。再加入美。而亞之　成。歐人最后加入。世界大同聨邦之局定矣。沙彌神信語余。世界美學原理。喜複雜。惡簡單。　聨合各簇各敎敎士以組織。則可并美。中國數千年。只言三敎。余病其隘。今宜加入回耶印度敎。爲。敎。更采取馬克司等之長。以適用於我之民生主義。以躋於大同。此我華人之責也。要　欲臻　同。必從異族異敎異階級通婚让做。則一切解决同化矣。</p>
<p>考回人之侵印度。有二因。一從西北東南下。欲掠其富源。一則欲傳回敎也。故所到處。印佛各敎皆毁壞無餘。至今印人不悅其興也。自亞拉伯。亞拉伯者言語之義。爲荒地沙漠之義也。　敎袜起時。亞拉伯爲多神敎。掠婦女爲娼。若有行一夫一妻制者。則引爲恥。蓋貧賤人也。婦女地位甚低。敎女之俗盛。拜日月石樹等神。有三等月姐神。一爲黑月。一爲白月。一爲中等月人死。於其墓上繫一牝橐駝。不與飲食。令之死。蓋以服役也。亦有耶敎。當時亦腐化。雜於多神敎而不可。據此種景象。又加以各部在異族統治之下。故穆氏之一神敎。乘之而起也。據言回敎起時。當世極放縱墮落。余觀回敎人一日數次禮拜。而長禮拜至叩頭百餘次。蓋軍隊精神之訓練。與艱難締造。非易易也。日人評論列寗爲二十世紀之穆罕默德。蓋言其艱苦也。印度敎之苦行也。趨於柔。回敎之耐苦也。歸於剛。人世之苦則一耳。</p>

<h3>女人女人（一八）</h3>
<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>小榮忍不住了。他已經忘了自已是他父母的兒子，是他妻子的丈夫，而只知道自已是丁小姐的情人了。他居然也高聲地向他的父親說：「别跟我鬧吧！也不給我留個面子1老實說，那個女的，錢多啦。！我若是老守在這個家裏，難道還要我拉馬車不成？你們管得我吧！嘿！」</p>
<p>眞不要臉！說出這種話來！呌你到上海去讀書，2没有呌你去做拆白黨！人家錢多，關你甚事！况且你也不能嘴硬！想想吧！前天回來的時候，拿了些什麽出去的？你這嘴臉兒，配不配這樣的胡鬧！」小榮的父親終于破口大駡了。　　　　小榮的母親也實在聽不過了，伊說：「小榮！我還以爲你是天正經經的讀書人哩！那裏知道你說出來的話竟是這樣的荒唐！回得家來。總没有好嘴臉，却來給做爺娘的受氣！你想想，你到上海去了一年。用了多少鐵了？這些錢又是那裏來的？現在你不要說得兇！只把前天拿去的幾件金器還了我，就讓你去享福作樂吧！好像你這樣的兒子，有了還不如没有的好！」伊氣得聲音也發顫。</p>
<p>小榮有些老羞成怒了，他雖然自知理屈，但也不願認半個錯。只說；「好！何必這樣呢？我不回來你們就打發小夥計來尋我，我回來了，又碰檯拍凳的給我一頓臭敎訓！好！我也不要聽了！」他一邊說，一邊竟飛也似地走出門去。</p>
<p>「且慢！你不能走！」</p>
<p>「不要放小榮走！」</p>
<p>小榮的父親和母親都追了出去，但是已經絲毫没有影踪了，只氣吽吽地蹩了回來，一個嘆息，一個痛哭。</p>
<p>不多時，小榮的妻子也提着賣花筐子回來了。分物婆婆就把方才的事情都告訴了伊，伊也氣得哭了。</p>
<p>後來，大家一商量，覺得非再把小榮去尋回來不可。小榮的妻子就自告奮勇，立刻趕往鐵路飯店去，好在伊平常時候也天天去賣花的，所以裏面的人都對伊很熟　伊到了鐵路飯店，先向賬房裏問着：「這裏有兩個客人丨丨一男一女丨丨是昨天從上海來的，男的穿着　黃色的洋裝，女的是燙着頭髮穿一件紅色的長旗袍的，在幾號房間裏啊！」</p>
<p>賬房一看是常來賣花的女人　想了一想，便說：「有是有的，大槪就是三十二號裏的客人了，祇是，今天已經回到上海去了！」</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市局勢稍定</h3>
<p>紗市趨勢稍定、因大跌之後、引動獲利者扒空、崦市上實需粗紗雲南帮稍有進胃、賣價較標紗高過三四兩、所以有一部份抵補心思總好、然測之世界狀况、無大漲之望、或稍回頭、亦不足爲奇、暫時或須盤旋之勢惟海外棉市大廉、紡織十支粗紗尙有大利可獲、故有一廠商套出遠期、前途情形、仍平常耳、</p>
<p>人標有大戶補空　人標前市開盤、美棉微跌、塲中賣戶較缺、市氣稍緊、各月漲一兩外、二盤又跌、三收盤有大戶扒空又漲、結果各月漲二四八、九錢、午後市氣仍緊、預測昨日美棉有漲風、各月又漲四·五賖　·九錢、成交計四萬九千二百五十包、查賣出大孚二千七碣　、明德一千包、公泰一千三百包、瑞大一千九百五十包、長豐二千包、益昶一千三百包、買進梅記一千二百包、明德一千二百包、恒德一千二百五十包、益昶二千○五十包、義餘一千七百包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市比較的和緩</h3>
<p>棉市略定、趨勢較前和緩、美棉微跌數磅音、然大勢狀况、依然平澹、因外棉合價低過華棉數兩、且各洋行在市抖售價格、均願十分遷就、但各廠鑒於世界情形惡劣、皆畏縮不動、故實際上殊少發展也、不過多數心理、以各方水災日烈、而美棉己屬低價、或有反動可能、所以大衆仍屬看好、然美棉米特令現貨祗合華幣三十一兩三錢六分（此係在美價格）向來較華棉高十兩、因其品質顔色良好、均可紡四十二支紗以上、本棉價格、前途仍屬惡化也、暫時或有一度小盤旋耳、</p>
<p>漢標略見回上　漢標前市開盤、以美棉微跌、明日有回漲之望、賣戶較缺、各漲五分至二錢装午後又漲五分至一錢、成交計十萬零六千六百擔、查賣出振大二千五百擔、泰興二千二百擔、同興二千擔、餘昶三千百擔、新豐三千二百擔、大豐一千五百擔、買進公泰三千四百擔、梅記二千六百擔、長豐二千九百擔、源大三千九百擔、賡豐二千七百擔、協生二千五百擔、新豐二千三百擔、益成二千一百擔、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>美棉微軟三品續堅</h3>
<p>美棉參差不定　昨日美棉先因缺乏信任心、市况參差不定、後因同業買進及華爾街有力略回、計期貨跌五至十磅音、現貨跌五磅间墌英棉期貨漲三四點、現貨漲七點、埃及棉現貨不動、印棉略有補空、市况堅穏、計平果爾漲二·五羅比、奥姆辣漲二羅比、白羅溪漲一羅比、原電錄左、（十一日電）</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市明定暗硬</h3>
<p>南市　各帮到貨因風阻乏抵、且河積凋零、致全市氣象蕭條、成交零星、各處秈米來源無多、且申地存底枯薄兼之又遇颶風、路阻之船隻均難達埠、價若增加、則由社會局派員在塲監察、嚴加阻止、不准再昂、且調查存貨、以致各貨行情祗得暫守原盤、</p>
<p>新閘　西路來源靑角蘇常等仍屬寥寥、洋蘆尖銷場客帮見活、發米去路亦好、價提一尺、薄稻厚粳限盤以來、明定暗緊、評價開出未有正式市面、惟聞阻途之船、約有三四十號、洋米客帮及本街去路似稍覺淡云、</p>
<h3>粉市忽見暴瀉</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後、各月份市面、忽見暴跌之象、查暴跌之由來、有二種主要之激動、一爲美麥之過剩、己見國際詳細之電訉、往後傾銷於中國、當然爲意中事、次爲内地廠及本埠之中小廠家、有訂購大批美麥之意、數在二十萬噸之間、此種消息、内地帮亦已遍傳、有此驚人之風傳、純屬投機之内地多頭、彷彿爲之喪胆、至廠家之抛售者、全日又達六七十萬包、故幾日前之銳氣、均受挫折、步步暴跌、觀此後如洋麥之趨勢不佳、國内雖人禍天災、終不免受國外之支配也、結果本月份較前日跌三分半、九月份跌四分二釐半、十月份跌四分七厘半、十一月份跌四分半、十二月份跌五分二厘半、正月份跌四分云</p>
<h3>麥價一致大落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均呈暴落之狀態、以國外旣有過剩之驚人消息、將來洋麥之訂購、彷彿不生問題、且以大戶多頭、逐步脫手、做心思者、似乎失去中心勢力、故各月份之賣氣、異常盛暢、各盤均逐步暴落觀後步當看洋麥之報告、再定消長也、結果本月份及九月份較前日暴跌一錢、十月份跌九分、十一月份跌一錢、十二月份跌九分、現麥市倩、以存底不豐、廠胃尙活、尙呈穏定、開南京·和州·鎭江·丹陽·蓬萊·太倉·雙鳳·唯亭·泗涇·直塘·等麥七千四百包、福新去一千七百包、申大去二千四百包、華豐去三千五百包云、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤開盤極俏</h3>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訉、古巴現糖價比前電無更動、紐約期糖九·十二月份亦乏起伏明年度三·五月份各比跌一分、爪哇現期糖依然無升降、公會市塲劃盤荷糖二十四號粗砂白買氣殊靜、普通貨十一兩四錢半、略高者十一兩五錢半、二十號中砂白十一兩、交易均寥、市形尙堅、太古Ｂ　十一兩一錢、ＤＹ　十一兩九錢半、受手岑寂、ＨＸ　十一兩八錢半、ＨＭ　十一兩四錢至十一兩四錢半、趨勢且俏、○　二五温開出三百餘包、價元九兩三錢半、市亦不弱、號盤有炳昌售開九號荷赤一千餘袋、價元九兩四錢半、行方進意頗健、市殊俏俐非常云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　篩莊桂圓又議增盤</h3>
<p>桂圓茲因到貨稀少、而號盤漸增、兼之存貨均經過焙、成本加起非尠、苟仍照原價售出、勢必虧本、以最近開價而論、再加揀選、頂極成本已近四十兩、故昨日該業公會議决、篩莊桂圓一律增盤、以維血本、其價如頂極售三十八兩、天極售二十八兩、天宏售二十二兩、出瓣售十五兩云</p>
<h3>蘭花子降落一兩</h3>
<p>蘭花子出新以來、到數不多、因現在尙非正水貨、故收採有限、昨濟南輪又到十餘箱、當已開出、價比前盤降去一兩、聞正水貨旬日後亦可登塲、據漢訉、本届收成尙豐、如後湧到、市價有步鬆之可能也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　餘杭秋蠶備種較暢</h3>
<p>餘杭一帶農民、因今歲春夏二蠶、類均失利、故特預備飼育秋蠶、以資補救、預向省蠶塲各製種塲定購大批改良種紙、現均分别交齊、各農民現正着手選種、以備孵化云、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶歐銷續旺</h3>
<p>昨日路莊土莊等路之珍眉綠茶、協和怡和同孚永興等行、進意續趨濃厚、婺東屯溪等路貨市盤業已提漲至一百二三十兩、市面異常堅硬、貢熙一項、俄國協助會進意頗濃、白頭莊及華茶公司、亦均有進胃、茶市趨勢、益形樂觀云、</p>
<h3>歐美絲銷仍無起色</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無起色、查歐美市塲絲銷不起、電轉寂靜、市氣呆滯、昨祇中和等進白乾經十五包、信孚進灰經二十包、價均堅定云、</p>
<p>雜訉　茶葉一千三百七十箱裝赴俄國、</p>
<p>現洋五十萬元、裝赴長江、</p>
<p>麥粉一萬三千八百包、裝赴漢口、又運去白米一千八百包、</p>

(12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Fan Pujiang stated, "When the Shi Yousan issue first arose, rumor-mongers said Shandong was in such and such condition. I came to Jinan under orders to see Han and found him to be frank and decisive, certainly not one to harm the public for private gain. Now, fortunately, the Shi issue is resolved, and the facts prove that what I said before was not false. This time, I am under the command of the Vice Commander to request Chairman Han to accommodate the Shi troops retreating from Shandong to complete the final phase. Since ancient times, only those who are loyal to friends can be loyal to superiors and to the nation. Han has extraordinary qualities that are admirable. Shi's troops total about ten thousand, organized into brigades and divisions. Han listened to the Central Government's orders." (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Urge Yan to Go Abroad Quickly</h3>

<p>Foreign Affairs Authorities</p>
<h3>Extremely Silent on the Korean Case</h3>
<p>Japan's Second Reply Has Not Yet Been Announced</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not announced Japan's second reply regarding the Korean case, and the truth is unclear. According to Japanese propaganda, Foreign Minister Wang and Shigemitsu Aoi recently reached a new understanding to ease Chinese public sentiment and express optimism about the negotiations. Foreign Minister Wang attended the Central Political Conference on the 12th and briefly reported on Japan's reply and China's response policy. However, there is no confirmed news as to when the third protest will be sent. Uemura, the Japanese consul in Nanjing, visited Jiang Huaben, the acting director of the Asian Department, on the 12th to discuss the Wan and Korean cases. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is maintaining silence. (12th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Japan's second reply was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Korean case, its content remains unclear as the Ministry has not made it public. Foreign Minister Wang attended the Central Political Conference on the 12th and briefly reported on Japan's second reply and China's response policy. It is still uncertain when China's third note will be sent. Uemura, the Japanese consul in Nanjing, visited Jiang Huaben, the acting director of the Asian Department, on the morning of the 12th. The conversation was public and reportedly related to the Wan and Korean cases. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhuang Songfu Talks About the Flood</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhuang Songfu said that this flood has affected sixteen provinces, with about 50 million people affected. Estimating one shi of grain (1/2 year's worth) per person, it requires 50 million shi of grain. It is a major question whether China's grain statistics show a surplus of 50 million shi. From the perspective of China's economy, estimating each shi at 12 yuan, then 50 million shi of rice would require 600 million yuan. Whether we can bear such a huge disaster relief fund is also a major question. The way to provide post-disaster relief lies in disaster relief as a temporary measure, and water conservancy as a permanent solution. The Huai River diversion project must be implemented in September or October, no matter what, using labor as relief. As for officials of various agencies and the Chinese people, they should show thrift and compassion. For example, comparing eating rice and eating wheat, eating rice requires six he per day, costing eight or nine cents, while eating wheat requires half a jin of wheat flour per day, costing only four or five cents. Saving half the cost per day, while increasing nutrition, is also an important item to solve the people's livelihood problem, he said. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Relief Committee</p>
<h3>Handling Emergency Flood Relief</h3>
<p>Raising Relief Funds Through Four Channels</p>
<p>Using Scientific Methods to Assess Disaster</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Relief Committee is handling emergency flood relief. The Ministry of Finance has allocated 2 million in salt tax treasury bonds, which have been received in Shanghai and will be immediately mortgaged for cash. As for the 20 million in disaster relief bonds, the issuing methods will be finalized at this week's National Government meeting. The emergency relief methods are being carried out through four channels: (1) Organizing a flood emergency relief association. All sectors of Shanghai have decided to organize 500 fundraising teams, each raising 1,000 yuan, for a total of about 500,000 yuan. (2) Raising funds through newspaper advertisements. The association will draft fundraising appeals and place them in various newspapers. Donations are coming in enthusiastically, especially from Shanghai. (3) Entrusting fundraising. They will ask enthusiastic charitable individuals to raise funds on their behalf. (4) Madame Sun Yat-sen's funeral funds will be used entirely for disaster relief. The relief methods are divided into emergency relief, work relief, and post-disaster relief. The disaster investigation commissioners sent to various provinces are all accompanied by engineers to measure water levels, flooded areas, and the ratio of local normal water levels to current water levels. Therefore, this inspection uses scientific methods. After the survey is completed, a meeting will be held to discuss the severity of the disaster and determine relief standards. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Urgent Problem of People's Food (3)</h3>
<p>Having discussed the superficial solutions as in yesterday’s commentary, what about the fundamental solutions? Let us elaborate.</p>
<p>First, it is about rectifying water conservancy. The harvest of agricultural fields relies entirely on water conservancy. However, too much water leads to floods, and too little water leads to droughts. Our country's rivers crisscross the entire nation. However, without proper water conservancy, we rarely benefit from them in normal years. Once there is prolonged rain, it leads to widespread disasters. For example, the Yellow River's riverbed is silted up, and its course changes unpredictably, leaving the banks along the river constantly under the threat of floods. Especially in northern regions, a little more rain turns them into marshlands, and a little drought turns them into barren lands. Although the government has established committees for river management and Huai River diversion, the latter has plans but lacks concrete work, while the former is merely nominal. Water inherently has benefits, and how to reap those benefits depends on human effort. Therefore, in the future, water conservancy agencies should develop detailed plans for rectifying river water conservancy and carry out practical work. Preventing harm should be noted, but seeking benefits is even more important. As it stands today, neither benefits are obtained nor harm prevented. The vast rivers are simply a source of disaster. Lest we give the world's countries cause for snickering. Second, it is about pacifying and resettling refugees. In recent years, natural and man-made disasters have struck one after another. The people in the southeast, northwest, and all directions suffer hardship and destitution. The strong wander in all directions, while the old and weak starve to death in ditches. Farmers have left their fields, resulting in widespread abandonment. In areas such as Shaanxi and Gansu, there are thousands of miles of wasteland. Bandit areas in Hunan and Jiangxi are especially desolate. Consequently, the people's food supply is dwindling daily. Therefore, the government should urgently raise special funds, coordinate the wasteland areas, and pacify and resettle the refugees. Provide them with loans and promote the organization of agricultural cooperatives to enable them to pool their efforts and help each other. In this way, the wasteland can be reclaimed and the people's food supply can be increased. Third, it is about improving agricultural methods. Our country's farmers have low levels of knowledge, and their farming methods are all stuck in the past. They do not know how to apply science to improve their methods. They do not know how to select seeds, cultivate seedlings, or prevent pests and diseases. After the harvest, they do not know how to properly store the crops. They use twice the labor to obtain a fraction of the harvest. This is also one of the reasons for the food shortage. Therefore, in the future, the Ministry of Industry should earnestly research and improve agricultural methods and educate farmers to increase agricultural production. Fourth, it is about improving agricultural tools. The old agricultural tools are generally clumsy, require a lot of labor, and yield little results. In the future, the government should emulate the new agricultural tools already available in various countries and set up factories to manufacture them. Such as wheat harvesters, threshers, water pumps, seeders, cultivators, etc., should be widely promoted to enable farmers to utilize mechanical power to increase the production of food crops. The above four points are all essential ways to address the root causes. There are many other methods, which we will discuss later.</p>
<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Deferment of War Debt Case</h3>
<h3>Implementation Details Released</h3>
<p>Six-Nation Financial Experts Reach Agreement</p>
<p>Germany to Suspend Reparation Payments for Ten Years</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th – The conference of financial experts from six nations, including Belgium, France, England, Germany, Italy, and Japan, who are considering the detailed measures for implementing President Hoover's one-year moratorium on intergovernmental debts, issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the payments Germany is required to make under the Hague Agreement will be suspended for one year, as proposed by President Hoover. The implementation details have been fully agreed upon. Reparation payments and inter-Allied debts suspended for one year, as proposed by President Hoover, must be repaid from July 1, 1933, with principal and interest up to 3%, over ten years. This approach should be acceptable to the US government and does not sacrifice the rights of any creditor nations. Repayment in installments is an absolute obligation and cannot be extended. Unconditional payments, such as those immediately transferred to the German Railway Company, should continue to be paid. Payments in goods must be based on the principle that they do not impede Germany's budget or harm the German economy during this year. Furthermore, payments due from Hungary under the Paris Agreement of April 1930 and payments due from Bulgaria under the Hague Agreement must be suspended for one year, subject to certain amendments. This principle has also been agreed upon. When accepting the proposal to repay the suspended reparation payments in installments over ten years, the German government stated that it did not wish to express any opinion on Germany's future ability to pay. It is reported that the German and Belgian governments have reached an agreement on the mark issue. The expert conference also agreed on the details of suspending war debts owed by the Allied nations to England, France, and Italy. It is noted that the US representative also attended the expert conference, and representatives from Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Greece, India, New Zealand, Portugal, Poland, Romania, and South Africa all supported this conference.</p>

<h3>Opposes Forced Taxation</h3>
<p>Whether to Attend the Round Table Conference</p>
<p>Depends on the Actions of the Viceroy</p>
<p>National News Agency, Bombay, 11th – Whether Gandhi will attend the London Round Table Conference is now uncertain again. Gandhi recently wrote to the Viceroy, accusing the Indian government of violating the Delhi Agreement, saying that this has created a new situation, making it difficult for him to go to London. Gandhi concluded by saying that whether he goes to England depends entirely on the Viceroy's actions. If the Viceroy can revoke the local authorities' decision to use force to collect local taxes, then he is still prepared to go. Otherwise, he will have to stay in India.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 11th – The Indian Chamber of Commerce nominated three representatives to attend the Round Table Conference, but the authorities only selected one. The Chamber of Commerce is very angry and has decided to boycott the Round Table Conference.</p>
<h3>Spain Still Unrest</h3>
<p>Moroccan Garrison Recalled</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 11th – After a brief period of stability, unrest is gradually returning to Spain. In Bilbao, communists and republicans clashed with gunfire, resulting in two deaths and dozens of injuries. Police in Barcelona also clashed with striking workers, reportedly with several deaths and injuries. In Saragossa, a group calling themselves the Unemployed Soviet sent a letter to the authorities, saying that if unemployment is not relieved within 24 hours, they will take free action and implement a policy of retaliation.</p>
<p>Madrid News – Spanish Finance Minister Príeto recently gave a speech in the Bilbao area, in which he implied that Spain could abandon its protectorate status over Morocco. He said, "Spain not only has no imperialistic ambitions, but is also prepared to leave its Moroccan territory. European countries</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>should invite the League of Nations to take over the protectorate." It is expected that the new parliament will discuss this issue. If the Spanish government implements this move, the international balance of power in North Africa will inevitably be disrupted. (World)</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 11th – The provisional government is planning to significantly reduce the garrison in Morocco. The infantry stationed there has been ordered to return home, as the local area is peaceful and does not require a large army. This move will save 35 million pesetas in military spending annually.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Abolishes Harsh Regulations</h3>
<p>Passengers in Transit Exempt from Paying Tolls</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 11th – Those who take the Siberian train used to have to spend 60 rubles within Russia (equivalent to about £6 according to the exchange rate set by the Soviet border). If they spent less than this amount, the remainder would be confiscated before they were allowed to leave the country. This regulation was most unpopular with passengers. British and American newspapers have recently written articles ridiculing it. The Soviet authorities have now abolished this regulation. From now on, Siberian train passengers will not have to spend 60 rubles in Russia.</p>

<h3>Pecovici Bank Closes</h3>
<p>Due to Speculative Losses</p>
<p>Reuters, Bucharest, 11th – The Pecovici Bank, formerly one of Romania's most stable banks, has suspended payments. This bank has close ties to the National Bank, which is now offering assistance to other banks to prevent further closures.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Bucharest, 12th – After the Pecovici Bank suspended payments yesterday, the authorities issued an arrest warrant for the managing director, Pecovici, due to alleged fraud. However, it is believed that Pecovici has fled abroad with his son, so neighboring countries have been asked to issue a joint arrest warrant. The bank has a capital of 735,000,000 lei, most of which has been spent by Pecovici on speculation. It is feared that after liquidation, thousands of depositors will receive little. Today, countless depositors tried to break into the bank but were dispersed by the police.</p>

<h3>A General Discussion of the South Manchurian Railway (Bin) (3) (Continued)</h3>
<p>(D) The Military Role of the Railway Currently, Japan is actively working towards the realization of the Jilin-Huining Railway. If the Jilin-Huining Railway is realized, it would be tantamount to a death sentence for our Northeast. Tanaka Giichi once said, "To implement the third-stage legacy of the Meiji Emperor (i.e., the destruction of the Northeast), the national army from Fukuoka and Hiroshima (Japanese army) will enter South Manchuria from Korea to control the northward advance of the Chinese army. The national army from the Nagoya-Kansai region will take the sea route from Tsuruga and advance to Chongjin, entering North Manchuria via the Jilin-Huining Railway. The national army from the Kanto region will depart from Niigata and go directly to Chongjin or Rajin, still relying on the Jilin-Huining Railway to rapidly advance into the North Manchurian region. The national army from Hokkaido and Sendai will depart from the ports of Aomori and Hakodate and rapidly advance to Yupu, occupy the Siberian route, and directly reach Harbin in North Manchuria, thereby threatening Fengtian from the south and occupying Mongolia, etc. At the same time, it can also prevent the southward advance of the Russian army, and ultimately meet with the Kansai army and Fukuoka-Hiroshima army on three sides, dividing them into two major armies. The south will guard Shanhaiguan to prevent the northward advance of the Chinese army, and the north will guard Qiqihar to prevent the southward advance of the Russian army. In that case, Manchuria and Mongolia's food and raw materials can all be taken freely by us. Even if we fight for ten years, we will not have to worry about insufficient food and raw materials."</p>
<p>Based on this, the military value of the South Manchurian Railway can be imagined. Although the Jilin-Huining Railway has not yet been realized, the distance is very limited, and the situation is even more worrying. The Andong-Fengtian Railway is directly connected to Korea, and its military role is undeniable. The current harm it gives to our country and the future persecution are even more alarming.</p>
<p>(E) Land Acquisition The South Manchurian Railway Company often lends funds to Koreans to rent and buy land from our farmers, indirectly acquiring it. Even if they forcibly seize it, they do not allow redemption.</p>
<p>(F) Active Immigration The Japanese, taking advantage of the convenience of the South Manchurian Railway, actively immigrate to our country. As of now, there are approximately over 200,000 people. The immigration of Korean people is even greater, reaching over 2 million. (Please refer to the author's article "A Study of Korean Immigration to the Northeast") This colonial policy further gives our Northeast endless persecution.</p>
<p>From the above economic and political perspectives, the South Manchurian Railway is more than enough to destroy our Northeast. Mr. Sun Yat-sen even said, "Japan can destroy China in ten days." The degree of danger is such. If our countrymen do not urgently seek self-defense, the vast future will be a dead end. With the times dangerous and the situation pressing, our countrymen should urgently rise up and catch up.</p>
<h3>(6) The Current Railway Negotiations and How</h3>
<h3>He Lun Advocates for the Recovery of the South Manchuria Railway</h3>
<p>As stated above, the harm the South Manchuria Railway inflicts upon our nation is, in general, already well-known. If our Northeast authorities wish to resist the Japanese railway policy, they must fundamentally focus on completing our own railway network. Therefore, in recent years, they have spared no effort in planning and implementing this network. The main components of the railway network plan are two major trunk lines, east and west. The eastern trunk line starts from Suiyuan, passes through Tongjiang, Yilan, Wuchang, Jilin, Hailong, Shenyang, and Dahushan, and ends at Huludao. In addition, several feeder lines are also planned. If this line and its branches are completed, (1) the rich resources of the eastern part of the Eastern Provinces can be absorbed by our country; (2) it will break through Japan's predetermined strategic defense points; (3) it will share the prosperity of the Tiantu Railway and the port of Chongjin; and (4) inland immigrants can be directly transported to the Yanbian area. This would be of immense benefit to our national defense and economy. The western trunk line starts from Huludao, passes through Dahushan to Tongliao as the southern section; Tongliao to Taonan (not yet completed) as the middle section; and from Tao'an to Keshan, Taian and other places as the northern section. Several feeder lines are also planned. Of this line, only the Tongliao to Taonan section remains uncompleted. In the future, when the entire trunk line and its feeder lines are completed, (1) Japan's predetermined military camp sites in times of war, such as the Xing'an Mountains, Kailu, and Taonan, will be broken through; (2) the rich resources of the northern part of the Eastern Provinces will be fully absorbed; and (3) the major land and sea transportation arteries of Europe, America, and the Orient will belong to us. This is also of vital importance to our national defense and transportation. With these two major trunk lines as the network and Huludao as the exit, it is further planned to open Qinhuangdao as a supplement. From the perspective of our politics, economy, national defense, population, trade, and transportation, these are all urgent countermeasures and practical plans. However, the Japanese are green with envy and panic, feeling like they have thorns in their backs. The government and the public are running around in a state of alarm, as if a great disaster is about to befall them. As for those warlord politicians, they are even more肆indulging in absurd and unreasonable arguments, unanimously advocating active intervention in our country's transportation administration. One argument is that the South Manchuria Railway is suffering due to the threat of our country's railways; another is that we are violating treaties. Some even advocate actively occupying our Northeast with military force. Eventually, the Japanese government transferred the skilled diplomat Kanya Uchida to be the president of the South Manchuria Railway and appointed Kimura as the representative for railway negotiations, one to reorganize the South Manchuria Railway and the other to negotiate railways with our Northeast. The purpose of the Japanese railway negotiations is generally still to seize new railway rights from us, complete the southeastern and southwestern railways, and hinder the realization of our railway network plan, as they have done in the past. This is confirmed by the four proposals put forward by Kimura: (1) the parallel line issue; (2) the loan issue; (3) the issue of fulfilling the railway construction agreement; and (4) the issue of revising freight rates. The proposal to fulfill the railway construction agreement focuses especially on the completion of the Jihui Railway. In summary, from the 31st year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty to the 18th year of the Republic of China, a total of 25 years, there have been 43 negotiations between the two countries caused by the Northeast Railway issue. In each negotiation, our country has been in a position of failure. What is past is past, but what is to come can be pursued. Although the sheep have been lost, it is still possible to mend the fold. Therefore, our countrymen should unite with all their strength to deal with this railway negotiation and not allow the Japanese to deliver the final death blow to us.</p>
<p>Now, at the beginning of Uchida's tenure at the South Manchuria Railway Company, he has carried out major reforms, concentrating all his forces in our Shenyang and deciding that the president will handle diplomatic affairs. Uchida is an experienced veteran in the Japanese diplomatic world. This time, he resolutely placed the South Manchuria Railway negotiations under his iron fist. His determination to attach importance to this negotiation and to strive to develop the South Manchuria Railway's mission of aggression is conceivable. Therefore, in the years to come, we must not be optimistic or idle. (Please refer to my article "The Importance of Sino-Japanese Railway Negotiations in the Northeast").</p>
<p>The people of our country are paying much attention to the railway issue in the Northeast. There are also many grand and righteous opinions on how to resist Japan's railway policy, which need no further elaboration. The author specifically proposes the point of how to prepare to recover the South Manchuria Railway as the conclusion of this article.</p>
<p>According to the construction of the Eastern Provinces Railway by Imperial Russia, it was based on the Sino-Russian Eastern Provinces Railway Contract signed in 1896 (August 27th, 22nd year of Guangxu). The last article of the contract (Article 12) states:</p>
<p>"From the date the company's road is completed and opened to traffic, the company shall exclusively obtain all profits from the railway for a period of eighty years. If there are any losses, the company shall also make them up on its own. The Chinese government shall not guarantee it. On the day the eighty-year limit expires, all railways and all railway assets shall belong to the Chinese government without compensation. Also, thirty-six years after the opening of the railway, the Chinese government has the right to redeem it at a price, repaying the principal silver used and the debts and interest owed on the road. The profits earned by the company, after being distributed to the shareholders, if there is a surplus, should be used as the principal that has been returned, which will be deducted from the redemption price. The Chinese government should deposit the price in the Russian National Bank and then take over the road..."</p>
<p>According to this provision, our country should unconditionally recover the Eastern Provinces Railway eighty years after the date of its opening to traffic. Thirty-six years after the date of opening to traffic, our country can redeem it at any time with preparation of price, which are clearly stipulated and undoubtedly.</p>
<p>The South Manchuria branch line of the Eastern Provinces Railway (i.e., the South Manchuria Railway) was built based on the Sino-Russian agreement signed on March 15, 1898 (24th year of Guangxu). Article 8 of the treaty states:</p>
<p>"The Chinese government agrees that the principle of the Eastern Provinces Railway Company's construction of railways approved in the 22nd year of Guangxu shall now, from the date of this bill of agreement, extend from a certain station on the main line to Dalian Bay...to build a branch line. All the examples in the contract established between the Chinese government and the Sino-Russian Bank on the second day of the eighth month of the 22nd year of Guangxu should be strictly followed in the above-mentioned extended branch line..."</p>
<p>According to this clause, the South Manchuria branch line can be unconditionally recovered eighty years after its opening to traffic, or redeemed with preparation of funds after thirty-six years, should be the same as the Eastern Provinces Railway.</p>
<p>The Japanese possession of the South Manchuria branch line was established based on the transfer in the Treaty of Portsmouth and the recognition in the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Agreement. Only the first article of the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Agreement states that "the Chinese government recognizes the various items of Russia's transfer to Japan in Articles 5 and 6 of the Treaty of Portsmouth." Article 2 further stipulates that "The Japanese government recognizes and complies with the treaties concluded between China and Russia regarding leased territories and railway construction..." The South Manchuria branch line was acknowledged by us to Russia's transfer to Japan. However, the essence of the railway construction contract has not changed. Our country can unconditionally recover it after eighty years, or redeem it with preparation of price after thirty-six years, which should also be as solid as an iron case.</p>
<p>Here, the Japanese may use the extension of the lease term of the South Manchuria Railway to ninety-nine years in the Twenty-One Demands as an excuse. However, our people have never recognized and can never recognize this treaty that loses the country. The Japanese must not rely on it as a basis.</p>
<p>In short, the above-mentioned various contracts and treaties are all unequal treaties that infringe on our sovereignty. In order to recover our sovereignty, these unequal treaties should be completely abolished. In terms of the treaty when the South Manchuria Railway was built, it can be recovered. In terms of abolishing unequal treaties and recovering our sovereignty, it should be recovered even more. The sovereignty of an independent country is sacred and cannot be violated by any country. The Japanese have no reason to obstruct our recovery of the South Manchuria Railway. Moreover, our country is currently negotiating with the Soviet Union to recover the Eastern Provinces Railway. As the South Manchuria is a part of the Eastern Provinces, its possibility of recovery is even more undoubtedly.</p>
<p>That the South Manchuria Railway should be recovered and can be recovered is already undoubtedly. The only question now is how to prepare for its recovery. The author believes that we should:</p>
<p>(1) Notify the Japanese government in advance to abolish all unequal treaties in the Northeast and set a date for the recovery of the South Manchuria Railway.</p>
<p>(2) Organize a committee to recover the South Manchuria Railway to study all issues such as preparation of price evaluation.</p>
<p>(3) Expand international publicity and restrain Japan's tyranny with justice.</p>
<p>(4) Actively complete the Northeast's own national railway network and complete the port of Huludao to reduce the economic value of the South Manchuria Railway.</p>
<p>Our countrymen should not regard this matter as too difficult. As long as our 450 million compatriots unite in will and are resolute in action, what cannot be achieved? It is up to the people to make it happen. Our countrymen should rise up quickly. (End)</p>

<h3>Yan Xishan Returns to Shanxi</h3>
<p>After Arriving in Datong, He Transferred Back to Wutai</p>
<p>But Has Not Yet Expressed Any Opinion on the Current Situation</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Although there have been frequent reports in the past month that Yan Xishan, who has been living in Dalian, would return to Bing, this has not been realized. Unexpectedly, at a time when the situation of Shi Yousan's defeat has eased, Yan suddenly took a plane from Dalian and arrived in Datong at about 5 p.m. on the 5th, spending the night in the headquarters of Zhao Chengshou, the cavalry commander. The Shanxi generals did not know about this beforehand. That night, Zhao secretly telegraphed Yang Aiyuan, Zhang Huizhao, Li Fuying, and others to report. Yesterday afternoon (the 6th), Yan had already returned to his ancestral home in Hebian Village, Wutai County. Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Zhang Huizhao, and others all went to pay their respects. The car road to the Taiyuan Hebian has once again shown the old scene of a busy road. However, Yan's attitude towards the current situation is still unknown to this day. However, the Bingyuan Garrison Headquarters specially notified various newspapers yesterday, instructing them not to publish the matter of Yan's return to Shanxi, but to make a public announcement after a day or two.

<p>Henan Province</p>
<h3>Floods in More Than Forty Counties</h3>
<p>Houses and Fields Were All Submerged</p>
<p>Reports of Drowning of Men and Women Have Been Received</p>
<p>Recently, the Henan Provincial Relief Association received telegrams from various counties reporting on the disaster situation and urgently requesting relief. Therefore, they specially excerpted the disaster situation and telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the Relief Committee, the provincial and municipal governments, various charitable organizations, and various legal entities, requesting them to quickly provide generous assistance in order to provide relief. The original telegram stated: "I have investigated that Henan Province is located in the Central Plains and has long suffered from warfare. In recent years, the disasters of war and bandits have exhausted the vitality of the province. However, Heaven has not pitied us and has once again brought us misfortune. Floods have ravaged the province. It has been raining for a month. According to the report from the Deng County Magistrate, continuous rain and mountain floods have caused the Diao and Tuan rivers to overflow and breach their banks. The flooded area accounts for half of the county. Tobacco and autumn crops have all been destroyed, with losses estimated at more than 10 million yuan. The Huangchuan County Magistrate reported that heavy rain and overflowing rivers have turned the villages along the river for 30 li into a vast ocean. Autumn seedlings have been completely destroyed, and there have been heavy casualties of people and livestock. The Xiangcheng County Magistrate reported that at the end of June, the Yin Cun Ru River suddenly burst its banks, turning dozens of villages in Zhicheng, Xinmin, Niepo, and other townships in the county into a swamp. Houses have collapsed, all possessions have been lost, and the autumn crops are endlessly submerged. The Xinyang County Magistrate reported that wind, hail, and heavy rain have caused a sudden mountain flood, and the plains have been inundated. Houses over 10 feet tall have been submerged out of sight. Residents, old and young, have been swept into the turbid current along with their belongings. Corpses are floating, houses have collapsed, and the autumn crops in the fields have been washed away. The Luoshan County Magistrate reported that heavy rain has poured down, rivers have overflowed, houses have collapsed, and the city walls have collapsed. White waves are滔滔sky, and the four villages are boundless. The Zhoukou Town Chamber of Commerce reported that heavy rain has continued for ten days, and fields and houses have been submerged and collapsed. The victims have no home to return to, and the goods of the merchants have been washed away. The upper reaches of the Shahe River have breached their banks, and the huge waves and雄濤sky are like galloping horses. The residents fled in panic at night and were mostly swept away by the turbid current. The cries were deafening and unbearable. The Xihua County Magistrate reported that heavy rain has continued for ten days, and the Shahe River has burst its banks. The streets and alleys in the city can be navigated by boat. Eight or nine tenths of the county's crops have been submerged. The men and women who are in distress are climbing trees and walls in an attempt to prolong their lives. The cries of grief are heartbreaking. The Neixiang County Magistrate reported that since July, heavy rain has caused disasters. The Tuan River, Ding River, Lao Guan River, Dan River, Diao River, and Mai River have all overflowed at the same time. Nearby villages have all suffered from floods. Autumn crops have been submerged without a trace, and there have been many casualties of people and livestock. The Tanghe County Magistrate reported that in early July, heavy rain fell continuously day and night, and the ditches and ponds were all full, causing the river to rise sharply. The villages within ten li of the nearby villages have become泽sky. Wheat has been piled in the fields and washed away. Autumn crops have been flooded. Men and women have been drifting in teams. More than a dozen boats have not been able to rescue all of them. The Yancheng County Magistrate reported that the rivers have overflowed, and Luhe Town has suffered the most severely. The water is more than ten feet deep, and merchants' goods have been submerged, with losses estimated at more than 10 million yuan. Residents risked their lives to escape, climbing to high ground or抱sky wooden planks, allowing them to drift along. The good autumn crops have been washed away without a trace. In addition, the four villages are blocked by water, and food supplies have been cut off. Even those who barely escaped will soon starve to death.

<h3>Erroneous Theories on the Manchu-Korean Cases</h3>
<p>Mr. Mori Kaku of the Seiyukai Expresses Himself in Andong</p>
<p>Forcefully Points Out That Japan's Diplomatic Policy Is Too Weak</p>
<p>Publicly Claims That the Jinan Expedition Was Enough to Satisfy Desires</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: After the Korean cases occurred, the Seiyukai sent five members of the Diet, including Mori Kaku, to Korea to investigate the causes. Mr. Mori and others completed their investigation on the 22nd of last month and traveled from Andong to Shenyang and Dalian to spread the Seiyukai's主張sky. On the 2nd of this month, they returned to Korea from Andong. In Andong, they announced their conclusions on the investigation of the Manchu-Korean cases, saying that the root cause of these two cases was purely due to the inappropriateness of Japan's current diplomatic policy. If it had been during the Tanaka Cabinet, there would never have been such a weak state of affairs. Mr. Mori Kaku served as the Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs during the Tanaka era and possesses eloquence sufficient to expound his erroneous theories. When he left Andong this time, he met with Mr. Shimizu, the secretary of the Japan Youth League branch representing the Minseito, at Andong Station for a great debate. Mr. Shimizu first said that the current state of Manchuria depends on the countermeasures of the ruling Japanese parties. The 70 million overseas compatriots in Manchuria entrust their lives here. For this reason, our Manchurian Youth League has specially sent representatives to lobby the mother country. Mr. Mori Kaku said that you are mistaken. The Minseito's policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia is extremely weak. This is the root cause of the Manchu-Korean cases. If it were changed to the Tanaka Cabinet era, it would surely satisfy your desires. The Jinan Expedition is enough to prove the truth of my words. Mr. Shimizu said that Your Excellency may not be clear about the situation in Manchuria and Mongolia. Allow me to say that Japan's acquisition of Manchuria was paid for in red blood. It has taken 26 years of management to reach today's state. Recently, the negotiations on the South Manchuria Railway parallel lines could not have been won with Shidehara diplomacy. The Tanaka Cabinet is difficult to believe. The failure of the Jinan Expedition is a disgrace to the Japanese people for all eternity. Mr. Mori Kaku said that have you ever studied the situation in Japan? Mr. Shimizu said angrily that we only know that the Manchuria-Mongolia issue is a matter of life and death for the Japanese Empire. At this point, the train to Korea arrived, and Mr. Mori Kaku boarded the train and left Andong.</p>
<p>Mr. Mori Kaku also said to those who visited him that he (Mori Kaku referred to himself) did not deliberately make things difficult for the Minseito. The facts of today have made me do so. Looking at the history of more than 20 years after the Russo-Japanese War, Japan's major constructions have all come from the Seiyukai. Today, the Minseito has changed twice, and the fundamental direction has changed countless times. We hope that the results of their policy changes will be good enough to show us, but knowing the facts, the opposite is true, which makes us heartbroken. Take Shidehara's diplomatic theory as an example. Its weak state has not only caused a lot of damage to the facts, but also damaged the prestige of our Japanese Empire. Looking at the Wanpaoshan incident, only a few "police officers" were sent. Compared with the Jinan Expedition of the Tanaka Cabinet, the difference is like heaven and earth. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese aggression against Manchuria and Mongolia is becoming more and more blatant. (August 6th)</p>

<h3>Real Situation of Damage to People's Fields in Wanpaoshan</h3>
<p>Recent Survey Findings</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: Someone here sent personnel to Wanpaoshan to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the damage to people's fields. They returned to the provincial capital on the 2nd of this month. According to them, "I went to Majiashankou and saw three cloth tents with 11 Japanese policemen and four Korean hired laborers. I used the name of a newspaper reporter to go to the cloth tents and meet the Japanese policeman, Muraya, and asked to cross the river to the west bank to inspect everything. The Japanese policeman said that the boatman was sick and there was no one to use. When asked how much of the good land west of the Yitong River was flooded, he gave a vague answer. I then went to Sun Yongqing's house in Sunjiayoufang to investigate. It happened that Yu the carpenter, a resident west of the river, was there. I learned that there was no flooding at all, but only four or five hectares of beach west of the river were submerged. However, it was found that the Korean people had completed the construction of the dam, blocking the water on the east bank of the upstream river, which was still more than four feet high and could not overflow. However, there was only beach on the north bank of the river and no embankment. Once there was heavy rain and mountain water flowed down, the area west of the river would inevitably become a swamp. It was also found that the ditch dug by the Korean people was about 20 li long, including about 8 li of good land, while the rest were old ditch wasteland. The landowners of all the ditches were scattered in various villages and it was difficult to find them all at once. Therefore, I immediately investigated the number of hectares dug up from each landowner at the village chief's office and brought back a list. But when I arrived at that place, it was dry and the river was dry. Yesterday and today, there has been heavy rain, so the disaster west of the Yitong River is as expected." The number of acres of people's land dug up by Korean people opening ditches without authorization and the names of the landowners are listed below: Sun Yongming 3 hectares (1 hectare is 10 acres), Ma Qingshan 3 acres, Sun Yongqing 2 hectares, Ma Wanshan 3 acres, Ma Baoshan 2 hectares, Ma Fushan 5 acres, Liu Changshun 1 hectare, Liu Changhai 1.5 hectares, Gong Shide 1 hectare, Sun Yongbin 2 hectares, Li Jinsheng 5 acres, Liu Changhai 0.5 hectares, Wang Zuobin 5 hectares (all of the above are good land, totaling 20 hectares and 1 acre). Sun Jiatong 2 hectares, Han Desheng 2 acres, Zou Tailun 1 acre, Zou Taijin 3 acres, Han Deqing 1.5 acres, Han Kuiwu 5 acres, Sun Yongqing 8 acres, Jiang Hongshan 1 hectare, Sun Wanyi 1.5 hectares, Sun Wanzhao 4 acres, Sun Wanying 1 hectare, Sun Yongbin 1 hectare and 2 fen, Sun Yongqing 3 acres, Sun Wanzhong 8 acres, Chang Delin 2 hectares (all of the above are wasteland, totaling 13 hectares and 7 fen).

<h3>Plans for the Jiangxi Provincial Transportation Network</h3>
<p>Being Designed by the General Headquarters' Party and Government Council</p>
<p>Wireless Radio Stations and Telephones Will Be Set Up in Each Bandit Area</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The General Headquarters' Party and Government Council believes that the traffic jams and delayed news in various border areas of the province are the biggest reason for the infiltration of red bandits. More than 40 counties that have been occupied by bandits are being recovered in order. In the future, the clean-up of scattered bandits and the handling of the aftermath and transportation liaison are extremely important. In addition to the construction of the Gan-Yue highway from Xingan via Jishui, Ji'an, Taihe, Wan'an to Ganzhou, and the construction of the highways from Linchuan via Yihuang, Nanfeng, Guangchang to Ningdu by the Relief Office of the Association by using work-for-relief, the Political Affairs Design Committee has also formulated a transportation network plan for the province, that is, to set up a 15-watt wireless radio station in each of the counties where the nine Party and Government Council branches are located, namely, Xiushui, Pingxiang, Yongxin, Ji'an, Ganxian, Guangchang, Nancheng, Jinxi, and Shangrao, and a 5-watt radio station in each bandit county under the jurisdiction of each branch. In the future, long-distance telephones will be installed in the bandit areas to form an integrated network. This case has been approved and will be implemented soon. The distribution mileage of the long-distance telephone network in each district is specifically recorded below: District 1 passes through Xiushui and Wuning, totaling 150 li; Xiushui and Tonggu, 160 li; Xiushui and Yifeng, 200 li. District 2 passes through Pingxiang and Yichun, 140 li; Pingxiang and Wanzai, 80 li; Pingxiang and Fenyi, 80 li. District 3 passes through Yongxin and Lianhua, 80 li; Yongxin and Anfu, 150 li; Yongxin and Ninggang, 60 li; Yongxin and Suichuan, 120 li. District 4 passes through Ji'an and Jishui, 40 li; Ji'an and Yongfeng, 90 li; Ji'an and Taihe, 80 li; Ji'an and Wan'an, 120 li. District 5 passes through Ganxian and Yudu, 140 li; Ganxian and Xingguo, 100 li; Ganxian and Nankang, 75 li; Ganxian and Xinfeng, 160 li. District 6 passes through Guangchang and Shicheng, 140 li; Guangchang and Ruijin, 130 li; Guangchang and Ningdu, 130 li. District 7 passes through Nancheng and Nanfeng, 120 li; Nancheng and Yifeng, 190 li; Nancheng and Yihuang, 190 li; Nancheng and Lichuan, 120 li; Nancheng and Le'an, 100 li. District 8 passes through Jinxi and Yujiang, 130 li; Jinxi and Guixi, 140 li; Jinxi and Zixi, 120 li. District 9 passes through Shangrao and Yushan, 90 li; Shangrao and Guangfeng, 45 li; Shangrao and Qianshan, 95 li; Shangrao and Hengfeng, 95 li; Shangrao and Yiyang, 125 li; Shangrao and Dexing, 160 li.</p>
<h3>Aftermath in Northern Fujian Divided into Five Zones</h3>
<p>Refugees Flock Back to Their Native Places</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the successive recovery of Chong'an, Guangze, Shaowu, Jiangle, Jianning, and Taining counties in northern Fujian, refugees who had fled to Nanping and Jian'ou counties have been allocated 6,000 yuan by the Red Disaster Relief Association. Kang Shaozhou, a member of the Provincial Party Department, and Lin Jinan, a member of the Provincial Government, have been dispatched to handle the repatriation to help them make a living. There are also about a thousand refugees who fled to Fuzhou. Now that the early rice is ripening, they are eager to return to their hometowns to harvest it. However, the steamboats operating upstream are taking advantage of this opportunity to raise prices, exceeding the original fare by more than double. Refugee groups from various counties have sent representatives to request relief from the Relief Association. The association has negotiated with the upstream steamboat association to reduce the fare by half, with the association issuing certificates for boarding. However, the steamboats are limited in capacity and cannot accommodate everyone, so repatriation began on the 6th in batches of one hundred people each. The association is also providing hard biscuits as rations and sending personnel to care for them on their journey. It is expected that the repatriation will be completed by the end of this month. However, the people of Ninghua, Changting, Liancheng, and Guihua counties in western Fujian are once again fleeing to Yong'an and Shaxian counties due to the intrusion of Red bandits from the Jiangxi border, and have telegraphed the province for relief. The Relief Association is currently coordinating measures. On the military front, the newly formed Second Division, under Lu Xingbang, is responsible for blocking the bandits. According to a telegram from Division Commander Lu to the province yesterday, the Sixth Brigade of his division, under Lu Xinming, has advanced towards Liancheng, the Fifth Brigade, under Ye Xingjin, towards Qingliu, and the Fourth Brigade, under Lu Xingrong, towards Guihua. He has requested that Zhang Zhen, commander of the 49th Division, also send troops to Shanghang and Wuping to jointly intercept the bandits. As for the aftermath in northern Fujian and the suppression of remaining bandits, these matters are being handled by Liu Heding, commander of the 56th Division. The area has been divided into five zones: the first zone, Jian'ou and Pucheng, is under the responsibility of Lin Bingzhou's brigade; the second zone, Shaowu and Chong'an, is under the responsibility of Qian Yuguang's brigade; the third zone, Jianning and Taining, is under the responsibility of Zhou Zhiqun's brigade; the fourth zone, Jiangle and Shunchang, is under the responsibility of Gui Zhenyuan's brigade; and the fifth zone, Yanping, is under the responsibility of Liu Shangzhi's brigade. In addition, Jiang Yan's brigade is serving as a reserve force to support the various zones. Liu Heding himself traveled from Yanping to the Shunchang area on the 5th to inspect the defense, and the local situation is still considered peaceful. (August 7th)</p>
<h3>Cantonese Bandits Repeatedly Bomb Ferries</h3>
<p>Two Ferries, one in Zhaoqing and one in Dongguan, were successively bombed by bandits</p>
<p>Eight Killed and Injured on the Dongguan Ferry, Six Injured on the Zhaoqing Ferry</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to recent military tensions in Guangdong, the frequent movement of local defense forces has led to increased activity by local bandits. Furthermore, river and sea pirates have become rampant again. In recent days, there have been reports of ferries being bombed, causing travelers to lament the dangerous conditions. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, the "Tong'an Ferry," traveling between Guangzhou and Zhaoqing, arrived in Guangzhou from Zhaoqing. While docked at the Chao Yin Street Pier on the Bund and passengers were disembarking, bandits suddenly seized the opportunity amidst the noise and secretly placed a bomb under the grand staircase of the Tong'an Ferry's cabin. At 11:40 PM, while passengers had not yet completely disembarked, the bomb exploded with a loud bang, creating a hole approximately two feet square in the cabin floor and destroying several steps. After investigation, a fragment of the bomb and a business card from the "Haiqiang Hall" bandit gang were found at the scene. The ship owner reported the incident to the Haizhu Branch Bureau. During the explosion, Chen Jiu, a ship's assistant, was seriously injured on the right arm, which was nearly broken, and his life is in danger. Another man, Liang Er, suffered injuries all over his body. In addition, Xia Wenshi, a female passenger, suffered leg injuries; Zhang Chenshi suffered injuries to her lower back; a coolie named Huang Fang suffered injuries to his right leg; and a passenger named Li Miaobi suffered injuries to his lower back and legs. In total, six people were injured. The morning after this incident (the morning of the 4th), the "Taisheng" ferry, traveling between Dongguan and Guangzhou, was also bombed by bandits en route. When the ship departed from Guangzhou at 6:15 AM on the 4th, nothing seemed amiss. However, when it reached the river surface near the Chebei Estuary Pagoda on Pazhou Island (under the jurisdiction of Panyu), a loud explosion suddenly occurred in the passenger cabin, killing two passengers instantly. Their flesh was mangled beyond recognition, a truly horrific sight. Six people were also injured at the same time. The deceased included a man resembling a soldier, about twenty years old, whose name was unknown. He was wearing a cloth undershirt and white cloth trousers. His head and both hands were blown off, and his chest and heart were injured. The wounds were charred and bloody. The other deceased, also an unknown male passenger about twenty years old, had his left forehead blown open, and his left flank had a wound about three inches wide, with intestines protruding. His skin was broken and charred. As the names and addresses of the above two individuals are unknown, and no relatives have claimed their bodies, the ship owner has temporarily provided coffins and buried them. In addition, six people were injured, and the investigation revealed the following: (1) Luo Bing, 36 years old, from Gaozhou, suffered injuries to his left and right legs and front arms; (2) Ren Shimei, 16 years old, from Dongguan, suffered facial injuries; (3) Huang Aying suffered injuries to his abdomen and elbows; (4) Zhang Ye, 51 years old, from Dongguan, suffered injuries to his head and left upper arm; (5) Ding Fa, 55 years old, from Dongguan, suffered injuries to his head, face, and left forehead; (6) Guo Ke, 30 years old, from Hunan, suffered injuries to his left upper arm.

<p>Sino-French Academic Expedition</p>
<h3>The Resolution of the Dispute</h3>
<p>A Letter from Chu Minyi in Jiuquan to an Important Figure</p>
<p>Bu An Dismissed, Pei Wenming Apologized, and the Matter Was Resolved</p>
<p>Both Parties Re-Sign a New Cooperation Agreement</p>
<p>Continuing the Expedition, Heading Directly to Hami via the Desert</p>
<p>The Sino-French Academic Expedition encountered a dispute among its members, with the Chinese member Hao Jingsheng being beaten by the French team leader Bu An. This incident raised concerns about national dignity, and fueled by patriotic sentiments, coupled with the presence of a Yellow Race Inspection Team in Paris, there was growing dissatisfaction domestically. Although the Chinese team leader Chu Minyi sent numerous telegrams, initially advocating withdrawal and then reporting that the dispute had been resolved, the details of the dispute and the resolution remained unknown to the outside world. Yesterday, a certain important figure received a letter from Chu, providing a detailed account of the incident: "I sent a letter from Bailing Temple, and a month has passed since then. Although the journey was extremely arduous, I arrived safely in Jiuquan on June 15th. After arriving, I negotiated with the French side and sent telegrams to the central government and the French ambassador through the Ancient Relics Preservation Committee. I believe these have been reported in the newspapers. Today, the negotiations with the French side have been satisfactory, so I have again telegraphed the central government and the French ambassador, reporting that the dispute between the two parties has been resolved satisfactorily. We are scheduled to proceed westward at 6:00 AM tomorrow, but we have decided not to go through Anxi but to continue through the desert to Hami. The recent cause of the Sino-French dispute lies with Mr. Hao Jingsheng. He was beaten and humiliated by Mr. Bu An at Hoyomoto on a certain day. The reasons for the beating are twofold: First, Chinese and Western customs differ, and once they embark on a long journey together, disagreements and arguments are likely to arise. According to Teilhard de Chardin (a geologist and Catholic priest traveling with us), French people also had conflicts among themselves during their last trip to Africa. Moreover, when Chinese and French people travel together, there are differences in language (Mr. Hao does not understand French), temperament, and other factors, which can easily lead to disputes. Second, the hardships of desert life can also easily provoke nervous excitement. With a slight lack of patience, anger can erupt uncontrollably. Therefore, when Mr. Hao and Mr. Bu An were arguing before the beating, I tried to dissuade them, but Mr. Hao scolded me as a 'slave of a fallen nation.' I did not respond but avoided his anger. Therefore, I had already left the scene when Mr. Bu An beat Mr. Hao. Mr. Hao's rudeness is undeniable, and I was also scolded. How could I bear to see him beaten by foreigners? Furthermore, at that time, Mr. Hao and Mr. Zhou Bao Han had withdrawn in the desert. Before receiving telegrams from Mr. Hao and Mr. Zhou from Baotou (sent on June 14th and received here on June 20th), I was deeply concerned about their safety. That is why I said what I did in the telegram to the French ambassador. Now that Mr. Hao and Mr. Zhou have arrived in Beiping early, perhaps they think that I ignored this matter. They do not know that after I arrived in Suzhou, I convened a six-person meeting, and the vote on whether to advance or retreat was evenly divided (Jiao, Liu, and Chu advocated retreat and return to the east, while Yao, Yang, and Zheng advocated advance and travel west). After continued discussion, Mr. Zheng also expressed his willingness to return east with me. Therefore, we decided to separate from the French side. On the one hand, we telegraphed the central government for instructions, and on the other hand, we asked Commander Ma, the local commander, to persuade the French to stay here temporarily and not to send wireless telegrams. The French were greatly embarrassed and claimed to be prisoners, but in reality, Commander Ma treated the French very kindly. We told them that we had telegraphed the central government for instructions and that we would stay temporarily until the central government sent a telegram. However, the French were eager to leave and could not obtain permission from Commander Ma Bufang. The French threatened Commander Ma, but we were willing to take full responsibility and sent a letter to Commander Ma, listing the French violations of Sino-French cooperation. The French advanced, but we did not. Commander Ma believed that if we did not proceed, he naturally would not allow the French to travel alone. Therefore, he conveyed this idea to the French, and the French realized the situation, apologized in person, and re-signed seven articles of continued cooperation. The main points are: (1) Bu An was removed and replaced by Burll (Pei Wenming apologized to Jiao Jihua, but this was not included in the articles); (2) Past disputes would not be mentioned on the road but would be reserved for negotiations in Beiping upon our return; (3) If one party was unable to enter Xinjiang, both parties would not enter; (4) The transmission and reception of wireless telegrams would be publicly announced, and wireless telegrams would not be used where there were telegraph offices, etc., a total of seven articles. The original text is copied separately. The French all agreed, and all six people signed the document. Therefore, we continued cooperation and are scheduled to proceed west tomorrow morning, bypassing Anxi and heading directly to Hami.</p>
<p>The reason for the third article stipulating joint advance and retreat is that Envoy Wei telegraphed, saying that Xinjiang welcomes the French but absolutely rejects our countrymen, and advised us to stay on the Xinjiang-Gansu border and wait for the French to return east and take us back. This intention is truly an insult to the nation and violates not only Sino-French academic cooperation. Moreover, I received several telegrams from Xinjiang refusing the French entry and even regarding the former Northwest and the current Sino-French collaboration as inviting wolves into the house. How can there be a situation of welcoming foreigners but rejecting our own countrymen? We did not believe in such unreasonable words. Rather than being abandoned by the French in Gansu, it is better to stay in Suzhou and wait for the central government to approve our cancellation of the cooperation agreement and return east. For the past two days, the atmosphere has been extremely tense, and there was almost another major dispute. Fortunately, Commander Ma Zixiang supported us, and we were able to reach a continued cooperation agreement, preventing the Sino-French academic expedition of 1919 from failing.</p>
<p>The origin of this dispute lies in Bu An's stubbornness and abuse of power in beating people for no reason, Pei Wenming's arrogance, and Envoy Wei's intention to abandon the Chinese members on the border, violating the cooperation agreement. Now that both parties have re-signed supplementary articles, I hope that there will be no more disputes in the future. The purpose of this western expedition is simply to study academics and develop the Northwest. From a broader perspective, the French side is only using this opportunity to promote the ability of their crawling cars to traverse the desert. One or two curious people joined, merely wanting to see the exotic customs of the East. As for imperialist aggression, etc., that cannot be discussed. The origin of this dispute is due to the imperfect organization of this cooperative group (in fact, it is extremely difficult to perfect this kind of organization), and emotional impulses and disputes are unavoidable and can be regarded as normal. However, when the dispute occurred between people of two countries, it involved the insult of the group, and due to the excessive concern of patriotic hearts, suspicion was cast upon the aggression of imperialism. In reality, all of these are caused by the word "misunderstanding." We have examined the matter carefully and believe that it has not caused any harm to the country or individuals, and it does not violate justice or conscience. Therefore, we have no choice but to compromise. As for the excessive concerns and misunderstandings of the people, they will gradually understand the facts and will have no use for their excessive concerns. Minyi respectfully submits this on the evening of June 20th.</p>
<p>Appendix: Sino-French Continued Cooperation Methods for the 1919 Academic Expedition. (1) Please have Burll act as the French team leader until the meeting in Hadier. (2) Wireless telegram messages shall be announced at any time. Wireless telephones shall not be used in places in China where there are telegraph offices.

(4) The situation encountered on the road in the past shall be temporarily reserved for negotiation, and shall no longer be mentioned on the road. (5) Future progress matters shall be discussed between the Chinese team leader and the French Acting Team Leader. (6) If opinions arise among the members of the team in the future, the Chinese team leader and the French Acting Team Leader shall consult and resolve them together, and shall not take direct action. (7) If both parties agree to this method, it shall be signed jointly by the six people Chu, Yao, Jiao on the Chinese side and Pu, Bu, and De on the French side, and each party shall keep a copy. June 20, 20th year of the Republic of China. Signed jointly by Bu An, Jiao Jihua, Chu Minyi, Yao Xijiu, Burll, and Teilhard de Chardin in Jiuquan.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Money Industry Requests Reduction of Business Tax Rate</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance replied with disapproval</p>
<p>Wang Zhengying, Director of the Department of Finance of Zhejiang Province, recently sent a letter to the chambers of commerce of various cities and counties, stating that according to reports from various chambers of commerce, the money industry has petitioned to reduce the business tax rate in Zhejiang Province to the rate stipulated in Shanghai, and that since banks and money shops both belong to the financial industry, and banks are not currently subject to business tax, the business tax on money shops should not be reduced, which is unfair. After investigation, the original business tax rate for the money industry in Zhejiang Province was 2 per mille based on the capital amount. Later, the Ministry of Finance revised it to 10 per mille, and all provinces have followed this regulation. This is a general case, and it is difficult to make any changes. The situation regarding the business tax rate differs between provinces and Shanghai, and they cannot be compared. This is not only true for the money industry. This has been clearly announced in the past. If the business tax rate for the money industry is changed to the Shanghai rate, other industries will also request to follow suit, which will inevitably lead to numerous disputes. In fact, it is impossible to comply. Although banks are not subject to business tax, the income tax law has been promulgated by the central government. The amount of tax they bear will definitely not be lighter than the business tax on the money industry. Therefore, the so-called unfair method is no longer an issue. Currently, the financial situation is difficult, and there is an urgent need for funds. Colleagues in the money industry are mostly deeply aware of righteousness and public service, and will surely consider the difficult situation of the government and enthusiastically contribute. If the resistance of one industry leads to other industries following suit, affecting the progress of taxation, this would not be in line with the principle of money industry colleagues loving and protecting the government. The chamber of commerce is hereby requested to inform the money industry to promptly pay taxes at the stipulated rate and not to wait and see. If other provinces have alternative reduction methods for the business tax rate of the money industry in the future, Zhejiang Province will then follow suit. And hope to inform them, to show public friendship. (12th)</p>

<h3>Re-election Meeting of Delegates to the Fourth National Congress</h3>
<p>Ma Yinbing and Others Elected</p>
<p>The re-election meeting of delegates from Jiangsu Province to the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang of China was held yesterday (the 12th) at 9:00 AM in the public lecture hall of Boxian Park. After the meeting was announced open, Yang Xingqin, a member of the provincial party affairs reorganization committee, gave a report, stating that today is the re-election meeting of delegates from Jiangsu Province to the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang of China. According to the central government's regulations, the province of sixty-one counties, generates a total of one hundred and twenty-four preliminary elected representatives. After two reviews by the Provincial Reorganization Committee, all representatives are qualified. Today, one hundred and twenty-one representatives are present, and the meeting can be convened in accordance with the law. Now, please elect a chairman. Representatives nominated Xie Chengyu and Zhang Renjie, and the central supervisor Wu put it to a vote. The result was that Xie Chengyu, a representative from Zhenjiang County, was elected as the chairman of the congress by a majority vote. The meeting was then held in accordance with the procedure, and the chairman reported that the process of the province's handling of this re-election meeting for the Fourth National Congress delegates would be briefly reported. After receiving the central government's decree on the election of delegates to the Fourth National Congress, the Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee decided to implement the preliminary election in accordance with the central government's regulations because the lower-level party departments in Jiangsu Province had been established one after another, and the Provincial Congress was scheduled to be held on the 15th of this month. Based on the time calculation, the formal Executive Committee could only be established in September. If the election of delegates from the province to the Fourth National Congress had to wait for the establishment of the Executive Committee, the time would be too short, and there would be many inconveniences. After the method was decided, on the one hand, it was reported to the central government for approval, and on the other hand, supervisors were sent to various counties to supervise the election. Later, the central government repeatedly sent telegrams to the meeting, stipulating the election method, and also sent Comrade Wu Jiayou to the meeting to supervise the election. All the processes were roughly like this. Then, the central supervisor gave instructions and read out the election regulations. Finally, the election was held. The chairman appointed Zhang Zhaobo and Chen Shouyan as supervisors, Zhu Jiming and Chen Zhenbang as ballot counters, He Jin and Yang Yushu as ballot readers, and Zhao Jianhua and Zhang Renjie as ballot recorders. After the appointments, the ballots were distributed, and the results were as follows: (1) Ten delegates were elected: Ma Yinbing, 105 votes; Xie Chengyu, 69 votes; Wu Baofeng, 98 votes; Yang Xingqin, 68 votes; Ye Xiufeng, 82 votes; Ge Jianshi, 67 votes; Zhang Yuanyang, 76 votes; Huang Yuren, 62 votes; Qi Xiyong, 74 votes; Gu Ziyang, 60 votes; (2) The five candidates with the next highest number of votes: Zhou Shaocheng, 53 votes; Cao Minghuan, 51 votes; Zhu Jianbai, 48 votes; Zhou Houjun, 52 votes; Yu Huaizhong, 51 votes. After the election, the delegates gathered in front of the bronze statue of Zhao Sheng and took a photo before dispersing.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Cutting Vegetables Leads to Beating and Injury: Xie Bochang and Zhou Shengyan, employees of the Sanyou Motor Company, went to the wasteland next to the railway water pavilion at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday to cut wild amaranth stems. A woman speaking with a Hakka accent came out to stop them, verbally abusing them. Xie and Zhou argued that the land was barren and the vegetables were wild, so anyone could cut them. The woman became furious and returned to the railway station, summoning seven or eight workers led by a worker surnamed Xie. They suddenly surrounded Xie and Zhou and beat them repeatedly. Then they tied them up, hung them on a tree, and beat them with iron rods and coal shovels. Villagers gathered to watch, but no one dared to step forward to stop them because the woman was so fierce. They reported to the Songjiang stationmaster, who arrived and stopped the beating. Worker Xie knew that he had caused trouble and insisted on escorting Xie and Zhou to Shanghai for investigation. After much persuasion, they were sent to Songjiang Hospital for treatment because Xie and Zhou had suffered serious injuries and needed immediate medical attention. It is reported that the villagers believe that the woman is the concubine of a certain worker and has repeatedly caused trouble. They have submitted a public report to the stationmaster requesting a strict investigation. Xie Bochang and Zhou Shengyan, who were injured, have also reported to the Ningbo-Shaoxing Association in Songjiang for assistance.</p>
<p>Aircraft Crash Damages Rice Fields: At 9:00 AM today (the 12th), a white aircraft from the Naval Command was flying back to Shanghai from Hangzhou when it suddenly experienced mechanical failure and landed near the railway in Xinqiao, damaging several acres of rice paddies. The pilot also suffered facial abrasions. Villagers gathered to watch, and the farmers whose rice fields had been damaged demanded compensation, claiming that their livelihood for the year and their ability to pay rent depended on the rice. The pilot agreed to compensate them, but there was a large difference in the amount of compensation offered. The villagers went to Songjiang County Government to report the matter, requesting the government to order the aircraft to be responsible for the compensation. County Magistrate Shen promised to investigate and instructed the villagers to return home. It is unknown how this will be resolved. It is reported that the aircraft damage is minor. The pilot has already taken a car to Shanghai. Police officers from the 10th Detachment are protecting the aircraft.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Department of Finance Urges Payment of Construction Bonds: The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued construction bonds, and Wuxian County was allocated 200,000 yuan. Former County Magistrate Huang convened meetings of local figures, but there were no results. The gentry believed that the construction bonds were used for construction in Jiangbei and had nothing to do with Wuxian County, so they could not use the money from Wuxian County for construction in other counties. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed the provincial government requesting exemption, but this was not approved. Former Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau also resigned due to the difficulty in raising funds. Yesterday, the Finance Bureau received a telegram from the Department of Finance urging payment by August 30th. Director Shen of the new bureau telegraphed the Department of Finance, requesting that the Construction Bureau be jointly responsible for handling the matter.</p>
<p>Appeal Judgment in Murder Case of Squad Leader: Zhang Zhaoxiang, the squad leader of the 4th District Detective Squad of the Water Police, was sentenced to seven years in prison by the Shanghai District Court for beating boatman Lu A'gen to death. Zhang appealed to the High Court, which has already completed the hearing. Yesterday (the 12th), the verdict was still seven years of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Three Boats Robbed in Donghu: Donghu in this county was originally an important transportation route, but reeds grow densely, making it easy for bandits to hide. The night before last, a merchant ship was passing by when it was suddenly intercepted by two bandit boats. They robbed the ship for more than ten minutes before leaving. After a while, Gu A'er's yellow mud boat was passing by and was spotted by the bandits, who fired a shot to stop it. As a result, several hundred copper coins were robbed. Later, a civilian boat from Kunshan with five passengers, including the employer He Rongrong, was spotted by the bandits. They fired a shot, breaking the glass window but fortunately not injuring anyone. He saw this and immediately ordered the boat to stop. Seven or eight people rushed forward and robbed silver, clothes, and other items worth about a hundred yuan. He, seeing the robbery, shouted for the police. The bandits became enraged and fired their guns. He was hit by a stray bullet in the leg. At that time, blood flowed like a river, but fortunately, the bone was not injured, so there was no major problem.</p>
<p>Rumor of County Magistrate Tan's Transfer to Qingpu: County Magistrate Tan Yigui of this county has been in office for more than a year. According to private sources in Zhenjiang, the Department of Civil Affairs plans to transfer Tan to Qingpu, and the vacant position will be filled by Yu Ding, the former county magistrate of Qingpu. County Magistrate Tan has asked for leave to go to the province. It is unknown if he will be transferred or not.</p>
<p>Provincial Representative Election Fails: The county party department's re-election of provincial representatives was originally scheduled for August 1st. However, due to a sudden case of peritonitis in the provincial supervisor Chen Kanghe, it could not be held. The province then sent Sun Danchen to Changshu and set the re-election for 9:00 AM on the 9th. To everyone's surprise, less than half of the attendees were present at the time (there were originally twenty candidates for representatives, but only ten were present on the day), and the meeting was declared a failure. Supervisor Sun left Changshu in the afternoon and reported the complex reasons for the failure to produce a provincial representative to the provincial party. On the 10th, Wu Zhongying and Shen Zuguan, the two party members here, also went to the province to make a statement.</p>
<p>Increased Defense Forces Continue to Arrive in Changshu: The 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Provincial Security Force has been stationed in Changshu for three months. Due to the unrest among bandits in the four townships, the companies have been stationed in Hupu and Taicang Floating Bridge. The 5th Company of the battalion is still stationed at the Jiangyin Corps Headquarters. Battalion Commander Shen here, due to the insufficient number of soldiers in the battalion headquarters, has been approved by the corps headquarters to transfer the 5th Company to Changshu to increase the city's defense strength. The company departed from Jiangyin on foot on the 8th and stayed overnight in Yangku. The next day, they arrived in Changshu and were assigned by the battalion headquarters to stay in the Boruo Temple outside the North Gate.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Tax Collectors Accused of Embezzling Grain: County tax collectors Wu et al. have embezzled about 100,000 yuan of grain over the years. Xu Zhenggang and others have obtained solid evidence and petitioned the county government to recover the funds. They received a written reply, ordering the Finance Bureau to investigate and report. Xu and others claim that Wang Huazhao, the former Director of the Finance Bureau, delayed the report and repeatedly urged him to no avail. They have jointly petitioned the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance to send personnel to investigate.</p>
<p>Trial Opens in Lawsuit Against Police Officer for Neglect of Duty: Lu Zhilin, a police officer at the 3rd Branch Station of the Zhaotunqiao Public Security Bureau in the 7th District of the county, was sued by Zhou Junren, the recent patrol captain, for accepting bribes from gambling dens and abusing civil and criminal cases. The county government approved the lawsuit and summoned the plaintiff and defendant to court. The National Judge presided over the interrogation. The two sides argued fiercely. As a result, the court ordered the defendant Police Officer Lu to provide a security deposit of 2,000 yuan and await investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Minister of Military Affairs Visits Wuxi The Vice Minister and Acting Minister of the Military Affairs Department of the National Government, Chen Yi, went to the Suhu area the day before yesterday to handle important official matters and inspect the garrison troops. He then took a train to Wuxi from Shanghai at 9:00 am yesterday. After Minister Chen got off the train, he went to the headquarters of the First Regiment of the Military Police to inspect for a week. He then went to the railway hotel to rest. At 1:00 pm, he took a car to Meiyuan to visit the scenic spots. At about 4:00 pm, he took a car back to Nanjing.</p>
<p>The Department Orders the Dissolution of the General Office of Trade Unions The General Office of Trade Unions in this county recently submitted its organizational charter to the county government for approval. County Magistrate Chen forwarded it to the Department of Construction for approval. After receiving the report, Director Sun issued an order yesterday stating that the organization of the General Office of Trade Unions in various industries is not legally based and should be dissolved. A report should be submitted on the implementation of this order.</p>
<p>Explanation of Key Points of the Provisional Court The county government recently received a provincial order to establish a special court to hear counter-revolutionary cases. The Jiangsu Higher Court recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice for an interpretation of two points regarding the provisional court: whether judicial officers should wear uniforms and whether lawyers should be allowed to appear in court to defend the accused. The instructions from the Ministry of Justice have been received: (1) Judicial officers under Article 7 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic of China should be assigned to appear in court in accordance with Article 5 of the Implementing Regulations of the Revised Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic of China. Except for the judges of the local court, there is no need to wear uniforms. (2) The provisional court mentioned in Article 7 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic of China is different from the previous special criminal provisional court in terms of organization, location, and reasons for its establishment. Furthermore, lawyers are only allowed to practice in ordinary courts in accordance with Article 1 of the Lawyers' Regulations. They are only allowed to practice in special judicial organs when there are special regulations. Currently, there are no special regulations allowing lawyers to appear in court in cases heard by the provisional court, so they are not allowed to defend the accused. President Lin issued an order yesterday to the county court and the county government to comply.</p>
<p>A Murderous Drama at the Wuxi Grand Theater The Wuxi Grand Theater in the park has been very popular since its opening. However, after 8:00 pm the night before last, more than 30 people in naval police uniforms suddenly rushed in. The ticket sellers tried to stop them, leading to a conflict. In the chaos, they used their belts and benches as weapons, causing the ticket sellers Xue Guangtao and Yu Agen to be injured and bleeding. Many objects were also destroyed. Afterwards, the police officers dispersed. The theater found a military cap and a belt on the ground. Along with the injured Xue Guangtao and Yu Agen, they were sent to the county court for examination and then to the hospital for treatment. They also filed a lawsuit with the court to punish the perpetrators and compensate for the losses.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Poisonous Substances Seized at Benniu Station A large quantity of poisonous substances was discovered at Benniu Station in Wuyi on the morning of the 10th. The Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau and the Water Police Merchant Corps went to investigate and retrieve the substances, which included two boxes of sugar powder, weighing a total of 101 kilograms, and one box of morphine extract, weighing approximately 40 kilograms. However, this was less than the amount stated on the shipping manifest. The station has dispatched police officers to guard the substances.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Rice Industry Voluntarily Suppresses Rice Prices Recently, droughts have affected various provinces. Rice prices in Zhenjiang have been rising daily due to the gradual scarcity of sources, reaching 15 yuan per dan (unit of dry measure). The rice shops do not have sufficient stock. At this time between harvests, the market price is expected to increase further. The Rice Industry Association convened a meeting of merchants yesterday for the sake of maintaining the people's food supply. It was decided that the highest market price for high-quality white rice should not exceed 15 yuan, and all merchants were notified to comply and not to increase prices privately.</p>
<p>The Grand Canal Embankment is Under Pressure Recently, the water level of the Grand Canal in Jiangbei has risen sharply. Sun Hongzhe, Director of the Department of Construction, led Pei Yixiang, Chief Engineer of the Water Conservancy Bureau, on a second inspection tour. They returned to the province by boat last night. It is reported that the water conditions were turbulent along the upper and lower reaches of the Zhou Canal. In addition, the Yi River flooded, and the water level rose by more than one zhang (unit of length) in seven days. The eastern embankment of the Grand Canal is in danger. Among the counties along the canal, Huai'an County has made great efforts in rescue and protection, and the embankment within its jurisdiction is relatively stable. The upper reaches of the Grand Canal are increasingly urgent due to the flooding of the Yi River. Director Mao of the Water Conservancy Bureau has personally gone to Qingjiangpu to oversee the work. He departed from Gaoyou the night before last (the 10th). Pei, Chief Engineer, also went to Gaoyou to oversee the work, departing from Zhenjiang at 4:00 am yesterday (the 12th). The canal embankment stretches for more than 300 li (unit of distance), and it is now planned to raise it by 5 chi (unit of length). The Water Conservancy Bureau is dispatching a large number of surveyors to measure and stake the embankment, and construction will begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>

Profits and losses will be shared, and mutual maintenance will be provided. Directors and supervisors from each factory have come to Nantong to discuss the details.</p>
<p>County Government Concludes Long-Pending Bandit Case The bandit case detained by the county government has been pending for more than two months due to the issue of jurisdiction. A joint order has now been received from the Pacification Office of the Provincial Government to submit the interrogation of the bandits to the Provincial Government for review. All Red bandits will be transferred to the Provincial Provisional Military Tribunal in Zhenjiang for interrogation.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Advises Against Unauthorized Price Increases in Various Industries Due to the recent stationing of troops in Tongcheng, stores have occasionally deliberately raised prices. The county government has found conclusive evidence that Guangda Nanhuo Store has cheated soldiers and has fined the store 2,000 yuan as a warning. The fine will be used for the public sports field, the nursing home, and the disabled home. On the 11th, the Chamber of Commerce notified all industries not to raise prices without authorization.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Headquarters Captures Extortionist Zhu Mian, the commander of the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces' Taihu bandit suppression, received an extortion letter last month demanding 600 yuan. On the 9th, he received a letter from the local post office urging him to pay, setting a deadline of 7:15 pm today, with the money to be placed along the Hongqiao Riverbank, behind the back gate of Nanjin School. On this day, Commander Zhu followed the instructions and placed 600 yuan in banknotes, wrapped in newspaper, at the designated location. At about 7:00 pm, adjutant Zhu Zhao and special agent Cao, disguised as people from Jiangbei, waited by boat at the entrance of the Education Bureau. At 7:30 pm, they saw a person pacing and observing the area. The person went to the destination, picked up the money, and Adjutant Zhu went ashore and captured him. He was taken to the security regiment headquarters at the Guan Yue Temple, where Commander Zhu interrogated him. The person confessed to being Shen Bingzhang, courtesy name Yi Zhi, nickname A Zhang, 20 years old, son of Jin Shou and brother of Chu Zhang, a teacher at Fu Yan. He lived west of the Wenheng Bridge and was a soldier on the Buxian patrol ship. He recently took leave to go home due to beriberi. He admitted to writing the extortion letter as a joke. His handwriting also seemed to match. In the afternoon, Commander Zhu and Adjutant Zhu went to Shen's house to investigate and inquired about Shen's usual behavior from his neighbors. They learned that Sun Baocheng's family, Xiecheng Village, and Zhang Sunyi's family, diagonally across from his house, had also received extortion letters. Zhang Wenqing's family in Zhongjie had received two letters. Commander Zhu believed that the repeated occurrence of this incident in the urban area was a matter of public safety. At about 5:00 pm, he sent Shen to the county government, where County Magistrate Peng personally interrogated him. Shen firmly denied the writing on the letter, but his handwriting matched the extortion letter. After the interrogation, Adjutant Zhu escorted him back to the regiment headquarters to await further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Proclamation After the Destruction of the Zhufang Ferry The county government of this county, in view of the destruction of the Zhufang ferry and the injury of officials, issued a proclamation stating that "the canal embankment is under pressure, and urgent repairs are needed. The Department of Construction's Water Conservancy Bureau needs to dispatch staff and transport materials, and it is necessary to release special ferries from time to time. People along the coast must not obstruct these special ferries, causing delays." The relevant public security bureaus and district offices were ordered to notify the public to comply.</p>
<p>Debate Over Whether to Open the Zhaoguan Dam Due to the continuous southeast winds, the water level of the moat in Yangzhou has risen sharply. As of the 11th, the Zhaoguan Three Ditch Sluice Gate of Jiangdu Pan still had 2 zhang and 4 chi and 1 cun (unit of length). However, the people upstream saw that the Xinnan Dam was not discharging smoothly and telegraphed the province, begging to open the Zhaoguan Dam. The people downstream desperately protected the dam. Dai Tianqiu and others here, in view of the history of the Zhaoguan Dam, not only because the stone work was damaged and difficult to repair and block, but also because the opening of the Zhaoguan Dam would turn the counties downstream into fish and turtles, telegraphed the provincial government, saying, "The Zhaoguan Dam is only a name, and it will never be opened. This has long been decided. Please do not lightly listen to the demands of a few people upstream and cause the deaths of millions of people in the counties downstream. Dai Tianqiu, etc. of Jiangdu kowtow."</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News Two hundred people from the five counties of Yancheng, Funing, Taixian, Dongtai, and Xinghua in the province went to the provincial government yesterday morning to petition. Chairman Ye and Director Sun came out to meet them. They presented five requests: (1) Please order the prohibition of opening the Zhaoguan Dam. (2) Please immediately allocate 150,000 yuan to the five counties for emergency relief. (3) Severely punish personnel who are ineffective in river works. (4) Please immediately allocate funds to manage the canal and repair the embankment. (5) Please open the Dongtai Yuhua Company's embankment to discharge water into the sea. It is reported that Ye and Sun both agreed to review the requests.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Three People Caught Stealing and Digging Embankment The Xiejia Embankment in the southern township of this county has more than 100,000 mu (unit of area) of farmland. Recently, the embankment has been in danger of collapsing due to erosion by the dam water. Farmers inside the embankment have been guarding against danger day and night. However, at about 12:00 last night (the 8th), the farmers guarding against danger suddenly saw someone stealing and digging the embankment. They immediately sounded the gong to gather the crowd and chased down two men and one woman. They also found an iron shovel. The three were sent to the Guangyuan Township Office. After interrogation by Township Head Chen, they confessed to being instructed by someone. When asked who instructed them, they refused to tell the truth. Township Head Chen believed that the matter concerned the lives and property of the entire embankment and planned to send the three criminals to the county government to request severe punishment.</p>
<p>Refugees Fleeing Famine Robbed En Route More than ten refugees fleeing famine to the south were loaded onto a boat in Youlin the day before yesterday. When they arrived at Baimamiao, they were suddenly met by four soldiers and bandits, each holding a handgun, who ordered them to stop. They swarmed onto the boat and robbed all the refugees of their travel expenses. Afterwards, the refugees had no travel expenses to go south and begged the boat owner to take them back to Youlin.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Yu Dengji Kidnapped in Yuyao Yu Liancai of Tanhai Village, Yuyao, had worked in the salt fields for many years and had a comfortable life. His only son, Dengji, had been a senior clerk in the salt affairs agency and had a good monthly income. Dengji recently fell ill and was bedridden, in serious condition. At 11:00 pm on the 6th, six bandits suddenly arrived, carrying pistols and acting fiercely. They broke into the upstairs room and forcibly dragged Dengji away, kidnapping him to the northwest. More than 200 yuan worth of cash and clothes were robbed. Before leaving, they sent a letter demanding a ransom, inviting the family to prepare silver and go to Shanghai to redeem the ticket.</p>
<p>Two Kidnappings (1) Wang Shuibao, a resident of Yunjiangqiao Yuncun Village, Yin County, was a farmer. At about 3:00 am the day before yesterday, nine bandits suddenly arrived, carrying weapons, and broke in over the wall. Wang Shuibao heard the alarm and got out of bed, but was unable to escape and was kidnapped by the bandits. His whereabouts are still unknown. (2) Li Ahua, a resident behind the Xie Xinglong Nanhuo Store at Haiyan Temple, Yuyao, was quite wealthy. He had previously received an extortion letter demanding 30,000 yuan, which Li ignored. At midnight yesterday, four or five bandits suddenly arrived, carrying wooden shells, broke into the room, and kidnapped Li Ahua. Li was already over sixty years old, and his family was very anxious after the kidnapping.</p>
<p>Bandit Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea Liu Xueliang and Lu Zongdao, the leaders of the bandits in Dinghai, organized the Loyalty Society in Shenjiamen, recruiting hooligans and bandits, endangering the local area. The Provincial Anti-Banditry Bureau secretly ordered the Water Police Bureau to arrest them. After receiving the order, Wang Wenlun, the director of the Water Police Bureau, personally went to investigate and arrest them on the Taian warship yesterday. Upon arriving at Shenjiamen, he learned that the criminals had fled to Putuo. Director Wang, together with Huang Qijia, the first water patrolman, and Wang Yonghua, the director of the Shenjiamen Public Security Bureau, went to Putuo Mountain. They found the bandit leader Lu Zongdao in the Miyan Temple on the mountain and arrested him. He was taken to the Taian warship and guarded by the police. Unexpectedly, the criminal pretended to go to the toilet and jumped into the sea. By the time the guard reported to the captain, the criminal was gone. Also, four policemen from the Zhenhai County Public Security Bureau, Kong Shiyuan and others, were ordered by the county government at 1:00 pm the day before yesterday to escort the four criminals Jin A'er, Hu A'fu, Zhang A'fa, and Shen Chuangui to the Dinghai County Court for interrogation on the Yaozhao ship. When the ship sailed to the sea area of Damiaoshan in Dingshu, the two criminals Zhang A'fa and Shen Chuangui pretended to go to the toilet and took the opportunity to jump into the sea. The criminals' hands and feet were shackled, and they sank very quickly. By the time the ship stopped to rescue them, it was too late.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education</h3>
<h3>Orders to the Education Bureaus of Songjiang and Jiangdu Counties</h3>
<h3>Regarding the Budget for the 20th Year</h3>
<p>Order to Songjiang Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Instruction No. 7171 to Songjiang County Education Bureau: The report is acknowledged. The increased education fees in various counties were originally intended to expand undertakings. Since the increase in education fees in this county in the 16th year, the class fees of various schools have increased sharply. The advanced funding for each grade of the complete primary school has reached an average of more than 1,300 yuan. With such high budget standards, the funding is insufficient, and it is difficult to expand the undertakings, which defeats the original purpose of increasing education fees. In order to promote the popularization of education and increase economic efficiency in various counties, the department believes that more undertakings can be managed with fewer funds. Therefore, last year, after careful consideration, a standard was formulated and ordered to be followed. Now, other counties have complied. Even a few counties that feel difficult and need to make slight changes have made considerable reductions. Only this county argues that it is difficult to reduce because it is near Shanghai. The department then ordered it to follow the methods of Baoshan and other counties. However, the director of the bureau still requested that the reduction be made gradually over the years. Therefore, the reduction in the budget for the 19th year was minimal. When the budget for the 20th year was submitted to the department, it was reviewed in detail and slightly reduced leniently, in the hope of gradually reducing it. However, the schools repeatedly requested to maintain the budget amount for the 17th year. The department had no choice but to send a special commissioner to investigate the actual situation. The commissioner found that the cost of living in the county was lower than in Shanghai and no different from other neighboring counties. However, the class fee for primary schools exceeded the department's standard by more than 400 yuan for advanced grades and more than 40 yuan for elementary grades. The commissioner's proposed reduction, taking into account the county's economic situation, was appropriate. The original report failed to consider the overall situation. The department's standard is 350 yuan per year for each elementary grade and 700 yuan per year for each advanced grade. If expenses can be reduced and redundant staff eliminated, then each elementary grade with one teacher can not only pay a monthly salary of more than 20 yuan but also have dozens of yuan for miscellaneous expenses. Each advanced grade is calculated with one and a half teachers. Except for schools with only one advanced grade, each person can be paid an average monthly salary of 30 yuan. The annual salary for each grade is only 540 yuan, leaving 160 yuan for miscellaneous expenses. Although the treatment is not very high, it is not as bad as the original report claims. According to the county's current class fee standard, the average annual expenditure for each advanced grade is more than 1,100 yuan. Calculated with one and a half teachers, the monthly salary of each teacher is more than 30 yuan, reaching 40 to 50 yuan, which is too high. Even the ordinary primary school class fees in counties near Shanghai are not known to be so high. The director of the bureau, who is responsible for the county's education administration, did not investigate the methods of neighboring counties and did not earnestly advise the schools on their requests. Instead, he simply forwarded the requests with the words "still the actual situation," maintaining the original plan, which is irresponsible. The director is ordered to follow the instructions in Instructions Nos. 1236 and handle the matter properly. If it is considered difficult to reduce the fees suddenly, a plan should be drafted, referring to the methods of neighboring counties and the situation of local schools, and submitted for approval for selection. This order is also to be followed.</p>
<p>Order to Jiangdu The education budget for Jiangdu for the 20th year has been repeatedly reduced by the department and the county. Now, there are still some points in the original budget that need to be revised. The department orders the county to instruct the bureau to follow the following: "The submitted documents have been acknowledged. The submitted education budget and the plan previously sent by the county education bureau are generally consistent. However, there are still some points that need to be revised, which are listed separately on the left: (1) The county junior high school actually has nine grades of students, but the budget only lists funding for seven grades. The remaining two grades are self-sufficient with tuition fees. This method is inappropriate. Now that there is no way to increase funding, the grades should be gradually reduced to a maximum of six grades. (2) The number of mu donations listed in the two separate books of the Yi Society and the She Society are each short. What exactly are they used for? A detailed explanation should be submitted immediately, and the shortage should be made up to emphasize special funds. (3) The county's education fees are heavily in arrears. In addition to the bureau's efforts to save on extravagant expenses, it should also find ways to rectify income and open up sources. The accumulation of malpractices in collection should be discussed with the county magistrate, and the finance bureau should be urged to find ways to eliminate them as soon as possible. (4) The part about primary school rectification should be handled in accordance with the report of Inspector Yang. (5) The organizational methods of the Education Endowment Management Committee should be revised in accordance with the report of Inspector Yang. (6) The expenses for the simplified elementary schools in the compulsory education pilot area have not been included in the budget, which is inappropriate and should be added immediately, and a plan and budget should be submitted for approval. (7) The county's literacy movement propaganda committee was established on April 9 this year. Why is the establishment of the committee still listed? Is it a mistake in guiding the establishment of district branches and township branches? An explanation should be submitted. (8) The county's mobile library and mobile lecture group were previously ordered not to be established separately. Why have they not been followed? The amounts for the expenses of these two times in the original budget should be deleted first. The Public Education Hall and the Public Lecture Hall should separately draft and submit a plan budget for approval. Before approval, no expenses may be used. If there are any unauthorized expenses, the director of the bureau shall be responsible for compensation. This order is to be followed, and the remaining are approved for implementation as planned. The mu donation expenditure book for the 20th year should be submitted for issuance in two semesters after the schools open. A copy of the original budget is returned, and the bureau is instructed to delete and retain it for reference."</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhou Tianchong Returns Home After Completing His Studies</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Tianchong went to France to study in 1928, majoring in history at the University of Paris. He specialized in the study of modern history of Western countries. After obtaining a master's degree from the University of Paris in 1929, he was guided by Professor Seignobos, director of modern history at the University of Paris (Mr. Seignobos is nearly 80 years old this year, has written extensively, and is a leader in the French history community), to prepare for a doctorate. His research paper, "The Irish Independence Movement," was passed at the University of Paris this summer and was greatly appreciated by Professor Seignobos, Professor Norovan (professor of European war history at the University of Paris), and Professor Pashes, professor of modern French history at the University of Paris. What attracted the attention of French historians to Mr. Zhou's thesis was the discovery of a secret agreement between the Irish revolutionaries and Germany in 1916 to jointly attack England. Before going abroad, Mr. Zhou studied education and wrote extensively. No one in the domestic education community does not know his name. It is reported that Mr. Zhou returned to China from France on August 7 and will engage in writing and translation in order to make contributions to history.</p>

His accuracy on cross-court shots and power on overheads were admired by De Fu. Qiu's strength led to the victory in the first set. After De Fu's group won one game, Qiu's group won five consecutive games. Jiang Daozhang made too many errors in the second set, leading to a 2-6 defeat. In the third set, Ta Fulas was not effective, and Qiu and Jiang won 6-3. De Fu's shots were extremely sharp, befitting a famous player. It was a pity that Ta Fulas was not in form, which made De Fu's mind and strength at odds. However, Ta's serve and net play were very powerful.</p>

<h3>Suppressing the Soaring Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Top-Quality Rice Fixed at 18 Yuan and 9 Jiao Starting Today</p>
<p>Prices Must Return to the Original Limit Within a Week</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Black Market Trading, Severe Punishment After Investigation</p>
<p>Rice prices have been soaring for days, causing public panic and uncertainty. The price on the 11th of this month reached 19 yuan and 5 jiao for top-quality rice. Yesterday (the 12th), the number of rice shipments arriving from the north and south of the city was scarce, and the storage in the river was even more lacking. The market atmosphere became even stronger, with a trend of rising by 7 or 8 jiao. Mr. Feng Liutang, the section chief of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, rushed to the North Market Rice Exchange Office in Xinzha at 8 AM yesterday to order a temporary suspension of price increases. He immediately convened rice merchants, distributors, and boatmen from Changzhou and Xichang at the office to analyze the causes of the price increase, which were approximately as follows: (1) Reports of floods from various places have caused more panic, and many are buying relief rice. In recent days, a large amount of rice has been transported westward from Wuxi and other places. (2) It is generally known that rice storage in various places is still abundant this year, and more than 400,000 bags of foreign rice have been scheduled to arrive, of which more than 300,000 bags have already been sold out. There is no confirmed date for the arrival of the remaining rice. (3) The amount of rice stored in various warehouses in this city is less than at this time last year. Due to the expectation of a bumper harvest last autumn, everyone dared not hoard it, resulting in a lack of rice to supply when the source is scarce. (4) The floods in the interior have not completely receded. In Kunshan and Dingli, civilians are still guarding the dikes, not only obstructing the navigation of small vessels, but also prohibiting heavily loaded civilian boats from traveling with gongs. As a result, fewer rice shipments arrive by river. (5) The recent hurricane has caused rice boats on the Huangpu River to stop in port to avoid the wind, delaying their arrival in Shanghai. (6) The rice boats from various production areas initially reduced their shipments because the loading was light, and most of them went ashore to paint. The number of rice boats has decreased, and transportation by train cannot meet the demand, resulting in a scarcer source. (7) People are uneasy and generally believe that the floods and famine in various places are significant. Most households want to purchase and store rice for future needs. The supply has decreased, while the demand has increased. Rice shops are also competing to purchase goods from dealers, and boatmen are becoming more reluctant to sell, creating the current situation. In fact, rice storage in various places is still abundant, enough to meet the needs before the new rice comes out. There is no need to alarm each other and increase the price of rice, only to suffer the consequences. Moreover, the 17 yuan limit price set by the Bean and Rice Industry Association is indeed a fair price. Unexpectedly, this special situation has made it impossible to maintain the limit price. However, this change will be restored when the wind stops and the water recedes. It is a temporary phenomenon and not a cause for concern. As long as the public remains calm, the arrogance of speculators can be suppressed. However, black market trading is the biggest problem in the rice market, which is most likely to disrupt the market and raise prices. It should be eliminated as soon as possible, and then the market can return to normal. After Section Chief Feng explained the situation to everyone from various aspects, Mr. Qiang Zisheng and Jiang Shizhi also made a statement. It was then summarized into four points: (1) Strictly prohibit black market trading and make the market open. If there is any black market price gouging, the Bureau of Social Affairs will send personnel to investigate secretly at any time, and each trade association will be responsible for reporting. Once verified, severe penalties will be imposed. (2) The price of 17 yuan should be the principle, but in this state of wind and water disaster, the price of rice has actually reached more than 20 yuan. Top-quality japonica rice is temporarily allowed to be priced at a maximum of 18 yuan and 9 jiao, and medium and inferior rice should be priced accordingly. It is only allowed to fall, not to rise. The time limit is one week, falling back to the maximum price of 17 yuan per stone. (3) Arriving good rice should be fairly distributed by the trade, and no price gouging should be allowed. When rice shops purchase large quantities, they should be dissuaded immediately. (4) The Bureau of Social Affairs should forward a letter to the Railway Bureau to allocate more vehicles to transport rice to Shanghai. Rice shops and rice dealers should also limit prices in order to benefit the people. The whole body agreed and promised to abide by it and not change it. The meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock. The North Market also opened immediately. However, the South Market did not have time to open because it was already late when the North Market made its decision. The Bureau of Social Affairs has already written to the Railway Administration Bureau, forwarding it to the rice stations along the route, requesting that they try to allocate more vehicles to facilitate the transportation of rice to Shanghai to help the people's food supply in this city. Food households in this city should also remain calm and not rush to accumulate rice, which will cause price increases. It is expected that the price will soon return to its previous level.</p>
<h3>Song Qingling's Arrival in Shanghai</h3>

<p>Substantial Results Have Been Achieved</p>
<p>Since Mr. Xu Shiying, chairman of the Relief Commission, received 2 million yuan in salt tax treasury bonds from the Ministry of Finance to address the flood disasters in various provinces, he believed that the disaster situation was serious and that relief should be distributed immediately. Therefore, at 12 noon yesterday, he hosted a banquet at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club, inviting important figures from the banking circles in Shanghai. During the banquet, Mr. Xu Shiying, chairman of the Relief Commission, reported on the detailed disaster situation and the current situation of the disaster victims in various provinces, requesting the gentlemen in the banking circles in Shanghai to raise 1 million yuan in advance to distribute emergency relief, using the 2 million yuan in salt tax treasury bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance as collateral. After discussion among the representatives of the banking and financial industries, it was agreed that the banking industry would be responsible for allocating 700,000 yuan, and the financial industry would be responsible for allocating 300,000 yuan, with a minimum interest rate of 7 per mille per month, to be paid in full immediately in order to rush the emergency relief.

<p>China-Japan Agreement Research Association</p>
<h3>Letter Requesting Collection of Opinions from Various Industries</h3>
<p>The Committee for the Study of Sino-Japanese Agreement Tariffs sent a letter to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, We have investigated the Sino-Japanese Agreement and found that the tariffs levied by both sides are extremely unequal. Therefore, Chinese goods shipped to Japan and Korea have plummeted, which is equivalent to being cut off, compared to the long drive and irresistible momentum of Japanese goods. The difference between the two is really immeasurable. In order to prepare for the worst and save the declining trend, our association has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the public be allowed to participate in the opinions. Soon, we received a telegram from the Ministry, ordering our association to convene relevant groups, carefully discuss, and study the results, and submit them to the Ministry for adoption, etc. Upon receiving this order, our association invited relevant groups to hold a joint meeting on June 23 of this year, and publicly elected 13 groups as members to form the Committee for the Study of Sino-Japanese Agreement Tariffs. Then, on the 5th of this month, we held the inaugural meeting, and each member took the oath of office, and decided on the procedures for the meeting. However, we have found that the number of our country's goods sold to Japan and Korea in the past was very large. Since Japan has repeatedly increased our import tariffs to the point of extracting 100%, they have been completely cut off, and it is difficult to sell even an inch of goods. Although the Sino-Japanese Agreement signed by our country's government and the Japanese side has reduced the tax by 30%, the tax rate of 70% is still too far from the tax rate levied on Japanese goods shipped to Korea and shipped to China, which is equivalent to zero. Therefore, revising this agreement is the only urgent task of our country's industrial and commercial circles. Moreover, the term of the agreement is three years, and now it is more than a year since the agreement was signed, and there is only one year of hesitation time. The contract will expire soon, and it is urgent to collect opinions from various industries and relevant associations as much as possible on the revision of the tariff in the Sino-Japanese Agreement, compile and review them, study them in detail, and invite legal and tariff experts to participate in the work, and then summarize them and compile a proposal to submit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for adoption and implementation, and to propose to Japan to revise the contract at the expiration date, in order to save the dying industry and commerce and benefit the development of national goods. It has been decided by the inaugural meeting and the first committee meeting of our association to request the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to send a letter to each trade association, requesting them to quickly collect the opinions of various industries on the revision of the tariff in the Sino-Japanese Agreement, compile them and submit them to our association for research and review, and submit them to the Ministry for adoption. We have the honor to present this matter to you, and we implore your association to quickly send a letter to each trade association, collect their opinions on the revision of the tariff in the Sino-Japanese Agreement, compile them and submit them to our association, so that we can proceed. We are extremely grateful for your attention."</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Carefully Employs Staff</p>
<p>Must Obtain Guarantees from Two or More Committee Members</p>
<p>If There is Any Embezzlement or Malpractice, They Should Be Subject to the Same Punishment</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee, in view of the unsatisfactory performance of the previous Anti-Japanese Association, and the key lies in the fact that on the one hand, the chairman system was adopted, and on the other hand, the employment of staff was not cautious enough. Therefore, at the beginning of its establishment, the chairman system was changed to a standing committee system. All release of goods, detention of goods, and important daily affairs must be agreed upon by four or more standing committee members before they can be exercised. Standing committee meetings are held three times a week to avoid delays. As for the staff of the association, it is often decided by the standing committee meeting that they must obtain the introduction and guarantee of two or more executive committee members. The guarantee must state that if there is any malpractice in the future, they are willing to be subject to the same punishment. The regulations are extremely strict.</p>

<p>Customs Brokerage Industry</p>
<h3>Please Abolish Foreign Customs Brokerage Firms</h3>
<p>Recommend Chairman Shi Zhikun to Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Transit Customs Brokerage Association, in view of the prevalence of foreign customs brokerage firms, which damages national rights and commerce, has recommended the association's chairman, Shi Zhikun, to go to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs. Mr. Shi has already taken the night express train to Beijing last night. The text of his petition is recorded as follows: "A petition is hereby submitted stating that foreigners are privately setting up customs brokerage firms, taking care of national taxes, infringing upon customs rights, and requesting that the Jianghai Customs investigate and revoke their licenses in order to maintain the national system and safeguard commerce. Tracing back to the loss of control of the Qing government, and foreign insults relying upon, the disaster of decline, has reached today. Due to the customs tariff agreement, the path of domestic production and industry will never be revitalized. Due to the division of customs rights, the possibility of prohibiting military contraband products from abroad is almost non-existent. And the Japanese are particularly dangerous and their plans are particularly skillful. They are even privately organizing customs brokerage firms in our country, registering with the customs, and taking care of customs taxes. The customs personnel have no national knowledge and think that customs clearance and tax payment are just one type of commercial behavior, and they are not careful and allow them to set up. How can they know that the international customs regulations are heavily guarded? Customs clearance and tax payment are extremely restrictive. If Chinese people are engaged in this industry, they must provide security deposits and set up joint guarantees, let alone foreigners. Even the most preferential agreements will never allow it. The rights of the country are related, and the principle should be like this. However, foreigners despise sovereignty and openly operate tax returns in our country. This has never been recorded in previous sessions, and it is even less allowed by international commercial law. It is requested that our Minister of the Court immediately stop it. According to the behavioral capacity of corporate legal persons, it is stipulated in the domestic law that foreign commercial offices in China are subject to the restrictions stipulated in the domestic law, and registration with the competent authority is a prerequisite. Foreign customs brokerage firms infringe upon customs rights, and the facts are obvious. The customs supervisor, as a Chinese person, should have no reason to rashly register them. If they are not registered, then all commercial activities of foreign customs brokerage firms are invalid. I am sincerely afraid that the customs officers will be ignorant and register them directly, and the foreigners will use this as a basis, rely on the consul for protection, rely on their financial resources as a backing, and squeeze out the legitimate commerce in the country, leaving them with no place to stand. This is a harm to the people's livelihood. Smuggling military contraband goods to foreign countries will always breed the roots of turmoil, which will harm the country. As for leaks, frauds, and violations of national regulations, it is not within the reach of national regulations and laws, and the harm is still small. It is requested that our Minister of the Court immediately correct it. This matter concerns national rights and is related to the people's livelihood. In addition to having presented it to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for review, I have specially recommended our chairman, Shi Zhikun, to bring the text and appeal to the Governor-General, ordering the Customs Administration to send a document to all customs offices to revoke the registration numbers of foreign-owned customs brokerage firms in order to consolidate national rights and safeguard commerce. We are truly in a state of waiting for orders."</p>
<h3>Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Donating Funds to Aid Overseas Chinese in Korea</p>
<p>The Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, After receiving the telegram, we have learned that the Korean anti-Chinese riots have caused our overseas Chinese to suffer deaths and injuries, and their houses and properties have been destroyed and looted, resulting in countless refugees on the road. We are deeply saddened and indignant by this catastrophe. We agree that it is our duty to assist with funds for relief. However, at a time when business conditions here are sluggish and the economic situation is unprecedented in the past ten years, it is not easy to raise funds in a hurry. Moreover, public donations are prohibited by the local government. We can only try our best to find a way to act according to the circumstances. As soon as we have collected the funds, we will remit them immediately, in order to fulfill our intention of helping neighbors in disaster relief. We hereby reply to the telegram, and we ask for your understanding. Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, with seal."</p>
<p>Boycott of Japanese Goods in Progress</p>
<h3>New Developments in the Cotton Textile Industry</h3>
<p>Actively Preparing Cotton Textile Factories: Since the initiation of organizing cotton yarn factories by dyeing and weaving colleagues in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, colleagues from various places have been very enthusiastic in taking on the role of promoters. Yesterday, a joint meeting of all representatives and promoters was held again at the Ruilinli Assembly Hall on Avenue Edward VII. Dozens of people, including Zhu Wenqi, Qiu Shuqiao, Chen Liesheng, Zhu Zhenhan, Gao Ruohua, Gao Jinru, Jiang Yongsheng, Que Pingzhi, Yan Guangdi, Guan Bingqing, Pan Xusheng, Tang Fuan, and Wang Tingcun, attended. The fundamental methods for excluding Japanese goods were discussed in detail. It was unanimously agreed that the organization of a fine yarn factory could not be delayed any longer and should be actively carried out. The following resolutions were immediately made public: (1) A preparatory committee for the organization of a cotton yarn factory should be established immediately, with thirteen members. One representative should be nominated from each of the counties with the highest yarn consumption in dyeing and weaving industries outside the city, such as Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wujin, Hangzhou, Wuxian, and Changshu. One representative should be nominated from each of the cotton weaving, knitting, and mercerized silk industries in the city, and one from the towel industry. (2) The inaugural meeting of the preparatory committee will be held next Monday at 10:00 AM at the same location, the Ruilinli Assembly Hall on Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>Preparing to Be Self-Sufficient in Handkerchief Raw Materials: In the past ten years, Japan's cotton textile industry has made rapid progress, transporting and selling goods worth billions upon billions to China and India every year. The immaturity and stagnation of China's cotton textile industry are undeniable. Although there has been slight progress in recent years, besides being able to weave 16-count, 20-count, and 40-count doubled yarns, its technical capabilities are far behind in various fine cloths. It is now known that the raw materials used in China's handkerchief industry are all made of 80-count, 60-count, or 42-count single yarns. In the past, all of these were imported from England, with annual imports amounting to no less than five to six million. In the past two or three years, Japan has been trying to seize this business, and its products are already being shipped to China for competition. However, except for a small number of handkerchief factories, they have not yet gained the trust of major handkerchief factories. Since the May 3rd Massacre, Ma Shijie, the general manager of Jingxin Handkerchief Factory and a leader in the local handkerchief industry, has had a plan to weave his own raw materials, but it has not been realized due to various difficulties. This year, after the increase in import tariff rates, each bolt of this raw material is subject to an import tax of more than two taels, and the exchange rate fluctuates greatly. It is imperative to weave the raw materials domestically. Therefore, the factory is determined to proceed. In March, it installed machinery and started trial weaving. Since March, the results have been very satisfactory. Products are now available to supply the handkerchief department for its own use, and plans are underway to raise large sums of money for expansion. According to Mr. Feng, the factory's general manager, the factory plans to purchase 200 of the latest model machines to weave handkerchief raw materials exclusively to meet the needs of various handkerchief factories in China. He also welcomes visits from all circles.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhijiang</p>
<h3>Hosted the Press Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Reporting on Pacification and National Arts</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang, the Director-General of the Jiangsu Pacification Office and the Director of the Central Guoshu (National Arts) Academy, hosted the press at the Dongya Restaurant yesterday afternoon to report on matters related to the Pacification Office and the Central Guoshu Academy. According to Zhang,</p>
<p>Pacification Plan: Through several months of effort, the remnant bandits have been largely eliminated. I have visited the Huai-Xu area and found the situation generally satisfactory. However, it is inevitable that scattered bandits will remain hidden among the people. These bandits hide when the troops arrive and plunder when the troops leave. Therefore, it is difficult to completely eliminate them by relying solely on military force. Therefore, the Pacification Office plans to adopt fundamental elimination measures during this six-month extension period. The second phase of the plan has now been drafted. On the one hand, troops will be used to suppress the bandits, and on the other hand, more attention will be paid to training local militias to enable them to fulfill their defense responsibilities and fundamentally eliminate the scourge of banditry. Troops may be transferred elsewhere at any time, while militias are permanently stationed. However, organization without training is difficult to defend oneself. Therefore, a long-term solution is sought. This plan has been discussed with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and it will be implemented as soon as it is finalized, in order to create a solid and permanent self-defense capability for the people of Jiangsu Province. As for the troops, the recent floods in the Jiangbei area have caused all matters to be temporarily suspended. However, all units have been ordered to shift their full efforts to rescue and protect the dikes. As soon as the floods subside slightly, the plan will be implemented.</p>
<p>National Arts Fund: The promotion of national arts is a fundamental way to remedy the weakness of our nation. In the past, Zichan was criticized by Mencius for providing small favors by ferrying people across the Zhen and Wei rivers on oxcarts, because there were too many people crossing the rivers to be ferried across one by one. Our country is currently beset by natural disasters and man-made calamities, with internal and external troubles pressing in on us. Although the government and major charitable organizations are doing their best to provide relief, they can only take care of the present and have difficulty looking to the future. The people must still strive on their own. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that since the beginning of humanity, the struggle has never ceased. We are all in the midst of struggle. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said that we should treat wartime as peacetime and peacetime as wartime. In other words, our lives are a constant struggle, at all times and in all places. However, struggle must stem from the spirit, and the spirit must stem from physical strength. Only with a sound physique can there be a sound spirit, and only with a sound spirit can there be the ability to struggle. However, nothing can make physical strength stronger than national arts. National arts are China's treasure, but they have been abandoned and not used, allowing us to be trampled on by foreigners, creating all kinds of national humiliation. Recent cases such as the Wanbaoshan Incident and the case of French members of the Sino-French investigation team beating Chinese staff members show that the promotion of national arts is a cure for our nation. If the people were in this time of wars and disasters, everyone could struggle and everyone could defend themselves. If this could be understood by every household and popularized among the whole people, the whole country would become one, and how could it not be strong? Therefore, the government has established a National Arts Academy in the capital, and it is now establishing a National Arts Specialized School to train teachers and promote national arts throughout the country. It is currently in the fundraising period. This matter and the pacification work can be said to be treating both the symptoms and the root causes. Gentlemen, as leaders of the press, you have a guiding responsibility for social undertakings. I hope that you will provide full assistance in the future if you need to borrow from me. The future of the two tasks of pacification and national arts will surely benefit greatly. Yuan Yeyu of the press then gave a reply, and the meeting adjourned at around 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Deng Jiayan Has Been Released on Bail</h3>

<h3>County Construction Bureau Director Sworn into Office</h3>
<p>Sun Shengzeng, the director of the Shanghai County Construction Bureau, was scheduled to hold a supplementary swearing-in ceremony on the 12th of this month. Yesterday was the due date. The Construction Department ordered County Magistrate Yan Shenyu to be the oath supervisor. The ceremony was held in the county government auditorium at 10:00 AM. Wu Kemin of the county party headquarters, Wang Huazhao, director of the county finance bureau, Shi She, director of the education bureau, Wu Jingqing, district chief of the first district of the county, Ye Dezhen, secretary of the county, Yu Fen, section chief, Yao Fusheng, chief of the public security section, Jin Zuobin, director of the public education hall, and Zhang Mengjie, representative of the municipal education bureau, totaling more than 100 people, attended. Xu Yu served as the master of ceremonies, and the ceremony was conducted as usual. Director Sun took the oath in public. The oath supervisor delivered a speech, and guests, including the director of the education bureau, the district chief of Wu, and the representative of the party headquarters, Wu, spoke in succession. After the ceremony, a photo was taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Oath Supervisor Yan's Speech: Today is the supplementary swearing-in ceremony for Director Sun of the Construction Bureau of this county. The Construction Department has sent me to represent the oath supervisor, and at the same time, I represent the county government to say a few words to Director Sun. According to the previous history, the two counties of Shanghai and Songjiang have a close relationship. The department is aware of this, so this time it sent Director Sun to serve as the head of Shanghai construction. Now, I observe that there are two points that should be paid attention to in terms of construction: one is to suit the needs of the local environment, and the other is to strive to implement construction within the limits of financial resources, so that the funds will not be wasted and the achievements will be practical. Although the construction funds in this county have not been very ample in recent years, we only need to handle things practically, and even with a small amount of funds, we can selectively organize them to meet the needs of the people. For example, the upcoming relocation of the county government, the establishment of telephones, the maintenance of the North Huilu Road, and how to plan the dredging of the Yu Tang River are all important constructions in this county recently. Although I have known Director Sun for a short time, I deeply believe that Director Sun is capable and knowledgeable. In the future, the construction of this county will be remarkable, and the realization of a new Shanghai will not be difficult. This is what I hope for from Director Sun.</p>
<p>Director Sun's Reply: Today, I am honored to have everyone here to give instructions on construction steps, various plans, and the needs of local construction. I am very honored. In the future, I will work hard on the construction of this county. This swearing-in ceremony was held earlier because the Construction Department scheduled a meeting of the directors of the construction bureaus of various counties on the 14th and 15th of this month. Therefore, this swearing-in ceremony was specifically held today in order to use everyone's grand theories as a reference during the meeting. There are many tasks in the construction of this county. It is useless to just talk about them. I will do my best in my job to seek practicality. I have come here with the purpose of working on the construction of this county. Although this county is limited by funds, it is not easy to develop the cause. However, construction must be in the spirit. As long as we put in all our efforts, everything can be achieved. I hope that the construction of this bureau will cooperate with various districts in the future, distinguish between urgent and slow, and carry out the work, which will be easier to start. Because each district is closer to the people than the bureau, it can understand the needs of the people. In the future, I also hope that various agencies will provide guidance at any time in order to achieve results more easily and achieve perfection.</p>
<h3>Wang Huazhao Handed Over Quickly</h3>
<p>Awarded a Major Merit</p>
<p>When Wang Huazhao, the director of the Shanghai County Government Bureau, handed over the Qingpu Bureau's affairs, he immediately prepared and sent the account books for handover. After receiving the telegram from the director of the bureau, the Jiangsu Department of Finance yesterday issued an instruction, stating, "It has been found that officials in this province who are handing over their duties often delay in sending the account books, or even fail to provide complete account books, and fail to respond to repeated reminders, which has almost become a habit. Now, the bureau is willing to prepare the total and detailed accounts of all the funds handled during his term on the day of handover, and transfer them to the new appointee for acceptance along with the cash of more than 9,000 yuan on the same day. The handling is swift and the funds are clear, which is the best in the province. A major merit should be recorded to show encouragement, and the current Director Chen should be ordered to promptly check and report the settlement of accounts within the prescribed time limit." This order.</p>
<h3>Father Labourer's Honour at the Observatory</h3>

<h3>Ratepayers Oppose Property Valuation for Donation</h3>
<p>Reiteratingly Admonishing the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to Mackie, the acting director of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, yesterday, stating, "Sir, We have received your reply No. 1098 dated July 30th regarding the method of collecting municipal donations for properties with actual rent, which still insists on destroying the good habits of the past. Upon examining the implications of the last paragraph of your reply, the Council believes that there is no room for change in this method of high property rent valuation for donation payment. However, this association believes that your Council is an autonomous organization formed by taxpayers, and absolutely does not want the Council's measures to differ from the wishes of taxpayers. Now, this association must again draw your Council's attention and cancel this distorted clause and disguised donation increase method for the following reasons: (1) The current municipal donation rate is 14% of the property rent. If there is an actual property rent that can be used as a standard for municipal donations, it should not be calculated based on the actual rent, but arbitrarily calculated based on the estimated property rent. Then, the previous increase in the donation rate, such as from 14% to 16%, is indeed superfluous. It is only necessary to increase the actual property rent by 20%. According to the increase in the donation rate, it must be agreed upon by the ratepayers, which is a legal act under the principle of autonomy implemented by the Public Concession. If the municipal donation can be based on an estimated amount that is higher than the actual property rent, then the subsequent donation increases can be entirely controlled by the Finance Department. How can taxpayers use any method to sanction it? Increasing the donation rate also increases the burden on taxpayers. Collecting donations based on a standard exceeding the actual property rent also increases the burden on taxpayers. For example, if the actual property rent is 100 taels per month, the municipal donation calculated at 14% is 14 taels. Now, the actual monthly property rent of 100 taels is estimated at 190 taels, and calculated at 14%, it is 26 taels and 6 qian. The increase in donation is essentially the same as increasing the donation rate, and it can be done at will. Can this disguised donation increase be permitted by taxpayers under the principle of autonomy? Therefore, this association must repeatedly admonish to maintain the two principles of autonomy and the rule of law. (2) When was the current land regulation established? There are written records to be relied upon, which will not be discussed in detail. What was the situation of the houses in the Public Concession at that time? As indicated by the facts, there were very few rental houses at that time, and most were self-owned and self-used. Under these circumstances, it was inevitable to adopt the British property tax system and use the method of rent valuation, because there was no actual property rent that could be used as a standard. The provisions of the land regulation were thus established, just like other laws and regulations, based on the current situation and had the same cause. If not, then after the implementation of the current land regulation, the municipal donation rate need not have changed as listed in Tables 147 to 148 of Volume 1 of Judge Feitang's report. The estimated hypothetical rent could be overestimated and still maintain the donation rates used in 1866 of 5% for foreigners and 8% for Chinese. (3) Fairness is the foundation for the existence of modern public institutions. If a certain obligation or right is to be given to or borne or enjoyed by a very small number of taxpayers, this is done under autocracy. How can an institution that claims to represent the rule of law and prides itself on being an autonomous organization formed by all taxpayers tolerate or act in this kind of unfair action? This association solemnly informs your Council that, in terms of the principles of autonomy, rule of law, and fairness, the director of the finance department should be ordered to stop this disguised donation increase method that is used to circumvent the ratepayers' right to consent. This kind of action is in fact an act of playing with words and laws, and is not upright. While processing, according to a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Chemical Industry Society, etc., "Sir, We are writing in reply to your letter No. 1098, which states that the property rents at No. 444 and No. 445 Henan Road are each 160 taels per month. The key point of this case is the fair treatment of taxpayers and the prohibition of increasing the donation rate by means of high property rent valuation. It is not a matter of whether the rent valuation is high or low. Your Council has not paid attention to the above-mentioned key points. Chong Qing Company cannot create this example. All of this increased property donation is really difficult to comply with. Corresponding protests are made," and so on. This association believes that it is very reasonable and corresponds to the letter, hoping that it will be checked and processed accordingly.</p>
<p>After the Weisshorn Ran Aground</p>
<h3>Also Looted by Pirates</h3>
<p>Distressed Crew and Passengers Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Weisshorn encountered a strong wind on the Fuzhou ocean and ran aground in Nanwan while sheltering from the wind. The ship was damaged, and the passengers were rescued. One crew member fell into the sea and died. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the ship was also looted by pirates after the accident, resulting in huge losses. The latest news is recorded below:</p>
<p>Warship Rescues Passengers: When the Weisshorn ran aground, the ship's radio had been destroyed by the wind and waves, and the motor had lost its effectiveness. The rescue signal could not be sent. The bottom of the ship had already been trapped in a hidden reef, and water was entering the hold. The ship's owner then used rockets for help. At this time, the wind was strong and the waves were high, and no ships were passing by. Fortunately, a foreign warship sailed from Xiamen Harbor and saw the distress signal. The ship immediately sailed to assist in the rescue. Because the bottom of the ship had been broken and could not be towed, the ship launched a sampan to transfer the rescued crew and passengers to the Hengsheng, which was sent to Shanghai. It has been confirmed that the Hengsheng is already on its way. If it does not arrive in Shanghai this afternoon, it will enter the port tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Pirates Loot Property: The Weisshorn's place of the accident was at the foot of a sea island, which is a den for pirates. After the warship rescued the crew and passengers, the pirates launched sampans and ventured into the Weisshorn to loot the luggage and property left by the crew and passengers. Anything that could be carried was taken aboard the ship by the pirates. Amid the fierce wind and waves, they escaped fully loaded with stolen goods. By the time the warship transferred the rescued crew and passengers to the Hengsheng and returned to protect the ship, the pirates had already fled with their loot. It is reported that many valuables in the ship were looted, and the public and private losses were huge. The ship is now under the supervision of the warship to prevent further looting.</p>
<p>Comprador's Assistant Dies: According to the news obtained yesterday, the crew member who fell into the sea and died on the Weisshorn was not the comprador, but the comprador's assistant. His name is still under investigation. As for the details of the disaster, it will only be clear after the rescued crew members arrive in Shanghai. The bottom of the Weisshorn has been broken by the reef, and all the cabins are flooded. Fortunately, it is搁 resting on the reef, so it has not completely sunk. However, there is little hope of towing it. The Hong Kong head office has sent personnel to the site of the accident to survey whether it can be towed. A decision will be made after the surveyor returns. Most of the cargo in the cabins is soaked in seawater. There is no certainty whether some of it can be unloaded and transferred. The ship was originally planned to go to Tianjin after arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong, so most of the cargo loaded on the ship was destined for North China. According to Shanghai shipping circles, the Weisshorn was the only ship that had an accident in the recent strong winds off the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian, which was very unfortunate for the company. The ship has peace insurance, so the company's losses are not much.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Reduces Municipal Expenses</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Land Bureau issued real estate deeds, it has collected real estate transfer taxes and municipal expenses in accordance with the usual practice. The real estate transfer tax was formerly known as deed tax, and the municipal expenses were formerly known as deed surcharges. This surcharge includes the expenses of the security corps, education fees, household registration fees, police fees, self-government fees, fire brigade expenses, the horse patrol fees of the former county magistrate's office, and the office expenses of the deed issuance office. The amount collected in each district varies. It is paid when the contract is signed. The receipt is filled out by the contract issuance office in each district. Later, the bureau believed that the amount collected in each district varied. Under the same city, the burden on the people should not be uneven. In May of the nineteenth year, it was approved to uniformly collect five yuan for every 100 yuan of the contract price. That is, whenever there is a real estate transfer, five yuan per 100 yuan of the contract price is collected for municipal expenses when the contract is signed. When the tax is paid, eight yuan per day is collected for the real estate transfer tax according to the contract price. The total amount of the contract price per hundred yuan is 13 yuan. After this reorganization, the burden on the two counties of Shanghai and Bao has been greatly reduced. Recently, in order to further reduce the burden on the people, Mayor Zhang instructed the Land Bureau to study the real estate transfer tax in this city, believing that the burden on the people was still too great, and instructed them to study the method and reduce it appropriately. After receiving the instructions, the Land Bureau immediately studied it in detail and planned to reduce the municipal expenses collected at 5% of the contract price to 1%. This 10% will still be allocated to the expenses of the contract distribution offices in each district as usual. It has been submitted to the Municipal Government and submitted to the Municipal Conference and the Construction Discussion Committee, and it has been approved according to the plan.</p>
<h3>Records of Current People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Wei Daoming, Liu Ruiheng, Zheng Hongnian, and others all left Beijing on the overnight express train and are expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying took the night train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhijiang Takes Office as Vice President of the Road Association</h3>
<p>Notice to All Branches at Home and Abroad</p>

Zhang has already taken office. The association has issued a notice to all local branches and the Nanyang representative office, along with a letter soliciting team leaders, stating, "Our association's Vice President, Mr. Jiang Zun, passed away due to illness on August 5th.

<h3>Lawyer Xi Yuquan Accused of</h3>
<h3>Incest and Rape</h3>
<p>Plaintiff is his cousin Xi Shulan</p>
<p>Claims she was defiled by Xi at sixteen</p>
<p>Used a pseudonym to give birth at Suzhou Hospital</p>
<p>Appropriated a box of gold jewelry and refused to return it</p>
<p>Lawyer Xi Yuquan, styled Linxin, is from Changshu, Jiangsu. His original residence is in Xiaoyushutou. Recently, his cousin Xi Shulan (25 years old) hired lawyer Xu Zuyan to sue him in the First Special District Court, requesting that he be prosecuted under Article 240, Paragraph 1, and Article 243, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for a guardian or caretaker raping a female under the age of sixteen under their guardianship or care, with the penalty for rape increased by one-third, as well as the crimes of forging documents under Article 224 and embezzlement under Article 356 of the same law. The court has approved the complaint and issued a warrant, ordering Jin Wanrong to notify both parties to appear in court for questioning. The original complaint is recorded below:</p>
<p>Entrusted with an Orphan During Father's Serious Illness, the Complaint Accuses of Seducing a Blood Relative Under Guardianship and Embezzling Guardian Property, Requesting Arrest and Punishment, and Ordering Compensation for Losses. The plaintiff, Shulan, is the cousin of the defendant, Xi Yuquan. Yuquan's late father, Lord Feizhang, and the plaintiff's late father, Lord Juntang, were brothers. On the fifth day of the third month of the lunar calendar in the fifth year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff's father passed away at the old residence in Nanshi Village in the original hometown. Only one year had passed since the death of the plaintiff's mother. He left behind four orphans, all young. The plaintiff was the youngest, only nine years old. The other three brothers were all over ten years old. During his illness, the plaintiff's father knew he would not recover and was deeply concerned that his orphans would not be cared for after his death. Therefore, in the second month, he invited relatives Qu Shaoqing, cousin Xi Baoshi, aunt Ding, and second uncle Feizhang to gather at his bedside to entrust them with his affairs. The three brothers were entrusted to different guardians, and the fields and houses were divided among them, with a will established.</p>
<p>Yuquan Inherited Guardianship. Subsequently, it was agreed with Lord Feizhang to assume the responsibility of guardianship for the plaintiff, and a box of gold jewelry, estimated to weigh over twenty-four taels (detailed list of items attached), was gifted to the plaintiff, designated for her future dowry. All the relatives present at the time were aware of this. Therefore, after the plaintiff lost her father, she was sent by aunt Ding to be raised by Feizhang, and the gifted gold jewelry was also handed over for safekeeping. Several years passed, and unfortunately, Ding and Feizhang passed away one after another. The defendant, Yuquan, then succeeded his father and assumed the responsibility of guardianship for the plaintiff. All the guardian property thus came into his possession.</p>
<p>Lost Virginity at Sixteen. Unexpectedly, Yuquan intended to embezzle the property, unwilling for the plaintiff to grow up and have a family, thus depleting his funds. Therefore, when the plaintiff was sixteen and lacked knowledge, he used seductive words and alluring appearances to entice her in various ways. The plaintiff, initially understanding love, was ignorant of etiquette and fell into his trap, resulting in Yuquan destroying her virginity, becoming a lifelong blemish.</p>
<p>Accompanied to Suzhou for Childbirth. Extending to the eleventh month of the year before last, the plaintiff was fully pregnant. Yuquan feared that giving birth at home would alarm the neighbors. Therefore, on the twenty-sixth day of the same month, he personally accompanied the plaintiff to Suzhou, staying at the Weida Hospital under the pseudonym Mrs. Zhang. Yuquan personally wrote the application for admission for childbirth, residing in room number twenty-four to await delivery. After more than a month in the hospital, she gave birth to a son on December 19th. Yuquan, taking advantage of the plaintiff's postpartum confusion, took the baby away for foster care, and its whereabouts remain unknown to this day.</p>
<p>Denies Gold Jewelry Completely. After returning home after childbirth, Yuquan initially treated her as usual, but then gradually showed signs of disgust, repeatedly scolding her and eventually forcing her to leave home and seek a living on her own. The plaintiff also knew that living under someone else's roof was not a long-term solution. However, to live independently, she had to consider her finances and had no choice but to ask him to return the gifted gold jewelry. Yuquan completely denied it, claiming that the plaintiff was fabricating and extorting. The plaintiff then complained to her relatives, who were all indignant.</p>
<p>United Family Members in Violent Assault. Afterwards, the defendant also knew that he could not hide the truth from everyone. He then entrusted a cousin, Chengnuo, to come forward to mediate, willing to give a thousand gold to terminate the guardianship relationship. The plaintiff, because the amount was far from the gifted property, refused to agree hastily. The defendant then had evil thoughts, determined to make the plaintiff unable to live in peace. Therefore, in the first month of this year, he united family members and carried out a violent assault. Fortunately, it did not cause fatal injuries, and she was able to preserve her life.</p>
<p>Elaborate Response. The plaintiff, after suffering this humiliation, thought it best to avoid the situation and went from Suzhou to Shanghai, instructing a lawyer to send a letter of inquiry. Unexpectedly, the defendant responded with elaborate words, falsely claiming that the plaintiff was an abandoned child found by the plaintiff's late father by the roadside. Later, due to not abiding by family rules, she was expelled and floated outside, having illicit relations with someone and becoming pregnant, resulting in secretly giving birth at the hospital. Now, she is falsely accusing people, trying to extort money, and is extremely shameless, etc.</p>
<p>Fabricated False Letter from Cousin. At the same time, he fabricated a false letter in the name of cousin Baoshi and sent it to the lawyer to cover up for himself. Considering that the plaintiff is the biological daughter of the late father, Lord Juntang, the whole family knows this. How can the defendant slander her at will? If the plaintiff was indeed an abandoned child and Feizhang was not entrusted with guardianship, then why would the defendant and his late father have spared no expense in raising the plaintiff after the death of the adoptive parent? This is enough to know that it is a fabrication.</p>
<p>Cousin Knows the Truth. The late father gifted gold jewelry to the plaintiff during his illness, entrusting it to Feizhang for safekeeping. There were relatives present at the time who witnessed the entrustment. How can he arbitrarily deny it? Although most relatives have now passed away and cannot be questioned, fortunately, cousin Baoshi is still alive and can be asked for the truth. If he claims that Baoshi did not hear about this matter, then why would the defendant fabricate a reply in his name? This further reveals the defendant's falsehood.</p>
<p>Hospital's Handwritten Application. As for saying that the plaintiff became pregnant through adultery with others, if it were true, then the defendant would have to expel her for bringing shame to the family. How could he avoid suspicion and accompany her to Suzhou, take her to the hospital, and personally fill out the application form? The director of the Weida Hospital, who assisted in the delivery, witnessed this, and there is also the defendant's handwritten application left in the hospital for verification. The court should order an investigation and verify the handwriting to see if it is from the defendant's hand. It will not be difficult to clarify with one interrogation. As for fabricating Baoshi's private letter, not only is the handwriting the same as the defendant's reply, but Baoshi has also issued a letter stating this. The evidence is extremely conclusive.</p>
<p>Often Visited Shanghai. The defendant has been working as a lawyer in Shanghai, setting up an office on Weihaiwei Road. He often brought the plaintiff to Shanghai to stay, and everyone in the office knew this. Now he falsely accuses the plaintiff of fleeing for a long time. How can this not be contrary to the truth? He is a lawyer whose duty is to protect human rights and uphold the rule of law. How should he abide by the law and cherish himself? Yet, he disregards ethics, seduces a weak cousin under the age of sixteen under his guardianship. First, he defiles her virginity, then he embezzles her property, and finally, he fabricates a letter that causes harm to others to cover up his crimes.</p>
<p>Requesting Severe Punishment. In summary, the above has violated Article 240, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, Article 243, Paragraph 2, Article 352, Paragraph 1, and Article 224 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, according to Article 13 (location) and Article 337 of the Criminal Procedure Law, each item, Article 506, I hereby submit this complaint, requesting your court to review and approve the arrest of the defendant for trial and impose severe punishment to warn those who commit incest and destroy morality. At the same time, order the defendant to return the embezzled gold jewelry of twenty-four taels and zero, or compensate for the equivalent price of gold, so that the plaintiff has the resources to live and avoid becoming a starving corpse. From now on, she will seek refuge in a monastery, repent for the rest of her life, hoping to make up for it in the slightest, and be grateful for the boundless kindness. I also request that witnesses Xi Baoshi, Xi Chengnuo, and the director of Weida Hospital be summoned to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Pu Jinghong Burned</h3>
<p>A Tragic Incident at the Singing Hall</p>
<p>First Went to Get a Permanent Wave</p>
<p>Carelessly Adding Alcohol Caused the Accident</p>
<p>Severe Injuries to Both Arms and Head</p>
<p>Tianyi Film Company at 232 Ganshidong Road in the French Concession has been busy lately producing the sound film "Spring in the Singing Hall." Yesterday evening at 8:30 PM, they were filming a scene with Fang Gu, the daughter of the singer Li Huifang, played by actress Pu Kunying. After filming two shots, the work was completed. However, as it was still early, Pu asked the photographer to take two still photos for her as a memento. Pu went to the dressing room to do her hair and makeup. At that time, the male and female actors were all in the photography studio. Outside the dressing room, only Duan Changxin was guarding the window. Suddenly, in an instant, a ball of fire started in the room. Duan was shocked and entered the room, seeing Pu Kunying burned by the fire and unconscious. He quickly used a cotton blanket to extinguish the fire. He then helped Pu out of the room and took her to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was found that Pu suffered severe burns, especially on both arms. Her head was also injured in various places. It is said that the cause of the fire was due to carelessness when adding alcohol. At the time, Pu was wearing a dark soft satin cheongsam, and her socks and leather shoes were also black. Pu Kunying, also known as Jinghong, is seventeen years old and from Shanghai. She joined Tianyi not long ago, and this was her first time on camera.</p>
<p>Lü Anchang's Heart is Too Cruel</p>
<h3>Dug Out His Wife's Eyes</h3>
<p>Quarreled Yesterday Morning Over a Trivial Matter</p>
<p>Dug Out Both Eyes and Rubbed in Lime</p>
<p>Lü Anchang Fled Afterwards</p>
<p>The Authorities Should Arrest and Punish Him Strictly</p>
<p>Lü Anchang from Yancheng, 35 years old, worked as a tea server at Yucai Public School on Shanhai Pass Road. His home was behind the reception hall at 20 Hemingfang on Xinjiang Road in Zhabei. Yesterday morning, the couple quarreled over a trivial matter. Lü Anchang then acted cruelly, gouging out Gao's eyes and rubbing lime into them. Gao fainted on the spot. Later, neighbors discovered it and immediately reported it to the patrol police. They took Gao to Renji Hospital for treatment. Chief Chen of the First Precinct of the Fourth District received the news and led the police to investigate. By then, the murderer had already fled without a trace. It is said that the couple had been married for many years and had a daughter named Yindi, seven years old. However, their relationship was extremely poor. Two years ago, Gao was abused and went to the Women's Association of this city for help. The association mediated, and Lü issued a written statement that he would not repeat the same actions. Regarding the gouging out of the eyes yesterday morning, it is said that there was more than one person involved. They first stuffed a towel into Gao's mouth to prevent her from shouting, and then carried out this cruel act. It is said that Gao was not at peace in the marriage, and her husband hated her to the extreme, so he took this drastic measure. The abandoned daughter, Yindi, has been transferred by the Public Security Bureau of the First Precinct of the Fourth District to the General Bureau for care. According to the doctor's examination, Gao's injuries are roughly as follows: Gao's eyes have both suffered severe injuries inside and out, with a lot of bleeding. The right eyeball has completely flowed out, leaving only an empty socket and already blind. The left eyeball suffered similar injuries, and it is difficult to predict whether it can be saved.</p>
<h3>Vendetta on the Opium Couch</h3>
<p>Luo Youlong Shot Three Times</p>
<p>A Stray Bullet Injured Zhao Er</p>
<p>Both Murderers Fled</p>
<p>At Chen Yunji Yanzike, downstairs in the east厢房 at 13 Baoxingli, Gongguan Road in the French Concession, at around 8:30 last night, a smoker named Luo Youlong went to smoke with two friends. Luo sat on opium couch number eight and called a waiter to bring two boxes of opium, smoking and talking. When the first box of opium was finished, the two friends took their leave. Shortly after the guests left, a man in a black satin长衫 suddenly came in and fired four shots at Luo with a pistol. After that he calmly left. Luo was shot three times, and the other bullet hit the leg of Zhao Er, a guest on opium couch number four. Afterwards, the owner of the opium den reported to the patrol police and took Luo and Zhao to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was found that two shots hit the chest and one hit the right hand, with very serious injuries. Zhao Er was shot in the left calf, which was a lighter wound. The French Concession patrol房 sent detectives to the scene to investigate and arrest the murderer. It is said that there were probably two murderers, one entered the room and one watched the door. The cause was probably a vendetta. After the injured Lu Youlong arrived at the hospital, he said that he lived at a friend's place on Zhoujiazui Road in Hongkou. No further information was given. Lu is 33 years old from Tianjin, and Zhao is 35 years old from Shandong.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Ren Zhennan Ordered to Pay a Penalty</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association believes that lawyer Ren Zhennan's case of being accused of fraud by Zhuang Li in the Shanghai Local Court and the case of his wife, Jiang, accusing him of insulting women, is detrimental to public morals. After the supervisory committee clearly investigated the matter, it was submitted to the Executive Supervisory Committee for deliberation and approval. Ren Zhennan, as a member, reported to courts at all levels and declared his withdrawal from the association. He also planned to submit a request to Chief Prosecutor Liu of the Shanghai Local Court to forward it to the Chief Prosecutor of the High Court to be punished on record. In addition to submitting the withdrawal documents to courts at all levels a week ago for record and verification, the association has also sent the request for punishment, stamped by the three standing members of the Standing Committee, Li, Liu, and Lu, to Chief Prosecutor Liu yesterday, requesting him to forward it to the Disciplinary Committee of the Jiangsu High Court for inspection and implementation.</p>

<h3>Robbers Robbed Ice Factory in Pudong</h3>
<p>At 0:40 yesterday (the 12th) morning, six robbers suddenly came to the Wujialong Welfare Ice Factory in Southeast Township of Hongzhen in Pudong (about four or five li from the town).

<h3>Cotton Famine in Wusong</h3>
<p>Due to the continuous rain during the early summer, all the cotton fields in the villages of Wusong were flooded, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. A famine has formed. The municipal committee office has received letters from Tu Di Bao Yu Fuhai and farmer Yang Jinchang of the district, stating that this year's early summer is when the cotton is developing, but the continuous rain has flooded everything, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Seven or eight out of ten fields in each Tu area are low-lying, and only one or two are high-source areas. Only two or three out of ten families in each Tu area plant rice. In this situation, the residents of the Tu area rely on planting cotton to make a living, and their livelihoods have become hopeless. They earnestly request relief to help the people of Jiangsu, etc. After receiving the letters, the office sent personnel to the countryside to investigate, assess the severity, and prepare detailed registration forms. They were reported to the Land Bureau and the Social Bureau yesterday, requesting that personnel be sent again for reinvestigation to show the reality and facilitate relief.</p>

<h3>Election Turmoil in the Women's Relief Association</h3>
<p>Dispute Arises Over Recognition of District Representatives</p>
<p>According to the Riri News, the Women's Relief Association of this city was established on the 8th. Only five days later, a turmoil occurred yesterday due to the issue of election candidates. The details are as follows: Yesterday afternoon, Lin Kecong and Wang Xiaoying held a district representative meeting at Wu Ben Girls' School. Besides the two committee members, Huang Daping, Bao Guangyu, Zhang Xuefei, and others also arrived upon hearing the news. At that time, representatives from Districts 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 had arrived. Lin Kecong then expressed his opinion, stating that District 7 was established after August 1st. According to the resolution, which stated that district associations must be established before August 1st, District 7, having been established after August 1st, naturally could not be recognized. At that time, Tang Naixin, Bao Guangyu, Huang Daping, Zhang Xuefei, and the other five committee members rose up in opposition, stating that if District 7 could not attend the election because it was established after August 1st, then District 6 was also established after August 1st, so why could it attend the election? The two sides began to debate. At that time, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters advocated that the elections for Districts 6 and 7 be suspended altogether. As a result, Huang Daping, Zhang Xuefei, Tang Naixin, Bao Guangyu, and the other four committee members withdrew from the meeting. More than ten attending representatives also withdrew one after another after seeing the four committee members withdraw, leaving very few. Lin Meiyan, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, declared that she would not be responsible for this type of election. Lin Kecong and others still issued ballots for the election. As a result, the election was hastily completed. The list of elected directors could not be ascertained.</p>

<h3>Telegrams Received from Various Provinces Requesting Aid for Flood Victims</h3>
<p>Red Cross Society: The Chinese Red Cross Society received telegrams requesting aid yesterday, which are summarized as follows: (1) Respected heads of the Shanghai Red Cross Society: Heaven is unkind and sends this great calamity. Our town is located outside the West Gate of Anqing. During this continuous rainfall, the farmers and tenants tried their best to protect it, and fortunately it was preserved. Unexpectedly, in recent days, there has been heavy rain for three days and nights. The mountain torrents in the Wan River have erupted, and the river tide has risen sharply by three feet, exceeding the water level of the 27th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The northwest embankment of our town has collapsed for more than a hundred zhang. Thousands of farmers and tenants gathered to protect it desperately, but the rain was too heavy, and the water level was deep both inside and outside, with no place to get soil. Therefore, it collapsed on the night of the 24th of last month. The water surged and rushed directly into the southern embankment. Countless houses in the town were washed away, and food, livestock, and equipment were washed away. Thousands of men, women, old and young in the whole town were unable to escape and were drowned, with dozens of deaths. At present, the disaster-stricken farmers are gathered on the embankment, without clothes or food, exposed to the wind and eating in the open air. The situation is urgent. It is found that Guangji Town has also collapsed. Before the collapse, the provincial and county governments supervised the rescue efforts. After the collapse, the government also properly handled the relief and accommodation. More than 10,000 refugees in our town, with 44,000 mu of farmland, have no house, no home, no clothes, and no food, and are extremely distressed. In addition to requesting the Anhui Provincial Government and Huaining County Government to allocate funds for relief, we respectfully recommend representative Xu Pingxuan to request your association to send personnel for inspection and to allocate relief funds as appropriate for emergency relief, so that the lives of more than 10,000 people can be saved from the ravines. We anxiously await your order. Farmers Cao Qingquan, Chen Jinghua, Wu Chunshan, Zhang Baozhen, etc. of the Guangcheng Town, Haikou Zhou, Huaining County, Anhui, and more than 10,000 others kowtow and weep. (2) Respected President of the Shanghai Chinese Red Cross Society: On the evening of the day before last month, the Liu River flooded, and the city has become a swamp. Houses and fields along the river have been damaged, and many people and animals have been washed away. The cries for help have been incessant for days. Our branch has sent lifeboats to patrol the river and provide rescue, and has also donated porridge to help the refugees, but our ability is weak and the disaster is serious. We deeply feel the insignificance of a cup of water to a cart of firewood. The General Assembly has great love in its heart. We sincerely request that you find ways to provide relief to benefit the disaster-stricken people. We hereby send a telegram to inform you. We implore you to consider it. Gao Chengzong, President of the Liuzhou Red Cross Branch, and Zhou Shu, Vice President, kowtow.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Relief Association: The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association received a public letter from the Taihe Fellow Villagers Association in Bengbu, Anhui, stating that Taihe is unfortunate. After the war and famine years, it was followed by hail, and after the hail, there is now flooding due to continuous rain. Since the beginning of summer, it has been raining continuously for days. The mountain torrents in the upper reaches have erupted, and the rivers and ditches are full due to the surging water, so that even places far from the river and along the river have become swamps. Corpses are floating in the water, and starving people commit suicide, which is often heard. The drowning of livestock, the collapse of houses, and the submergence of fields cannot be counted. The disaster-stricken people who have come to the city to seek refuge are supporting the old and carrying the young, and their cries shake the sky. Recently, there has been heavy rain that has not stopped for several days, and more than ten zhang of the city wall have collapsed again, and everyone is in danger. A survey shows that 95% of the county has been flooded, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The association also received a telegram from the Second District Party Headquarters and the Third District Office of Hanshan County, Anhui, stating that since the beginning of summer, giant waves have come with the wind and rain, and more than sixty large and small towns have been broken at the same time. Fields, houses, people, and livestock have been washed away, and a vast expanse of water has become a swamp. Those who have not died from drowning will die from starvation. The association also received a public letter from the Suxian County Relief Committee, Anhui, stating that this year's wheat was about to mature when it was tragically ravaged by the hail god, and countless people and animals were injured and killed, and no grain was left in the fields. Unexpectedly, future disasters have only increased and not decreased. Recently, there has been continuous rain for days, and strong winds and heavy rain have submerged the fields and destroyed the houses, which is a unprecedented catastrophe. The association also received a telegram from the Taixian County Government and various organizations in Jiangsu, stating that Taixian is unfortunate. Since July of this year, there has been continuous rain for a whole month, causing many sections of the city wall to collapse and countless houses to collapse. The water level is several feet deep on the plains, and ruined walls are everywhere. We still hope that</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>the autumn harvest will be fruitful, so that we can make up for the losses a little. Unexpectedly, the lake water has risen again, and the damage is even greater. The harvest of early and late rice is hopeless, and the amount of loss is incalculable. At present, the farmers in various places not only have no surplus in their granaries, but also have no food to eat. Moreover, their villages have become swamps, and they have nowhere to live. The tragic situation is difficult to describe in full.</p>

<h3>Emergency Meeting Held Yesterday</h3>

Mr. Zhu, a member of the Standing Committee, was elected as chairman to report on the case. More than two years have passed since the incident occurred on July 21, 1929. During these two years, we have repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to the Central Government, the National Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, and various national organizations, appealing and begging for help. We have also petitioned in Beijing three times. Although the government authorities and the people of the whole country have expressed deep sympathy and given us their utmost concern, the international environment has ultimately not been adequately resolved, causing the dead to die unjustly at the bottom of the sea and the living to cry in pain in the world. Thinking of this, we are heartbroken and weeping. Subsequently, according to international practice, in the event of a maritime disaster, a lawsuit for damages may be filed in the local court in accordance with the law. Therefore, following the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, we filed a lawsuit for damages with the First Local Court of the Shanghai Special District. The enthusiasm and righteousness of the two great lawyers, Wu Jingxiong and Sheng Zhenwei, are not only admired by the members of this association, but also welcomed by the people of the whole country who are concerned about this case. The case has now been scheduled for trial in the Ninth Division of the Special Court at 8:00 a.m. on the 15th of this month. We ask everyone to discuss at length how everything should proceed in the future. Family members spoke one after another, and their anger overflowed in their words. The old, the young, and the women were especially moved to tears. After discussion, it was decided: (1) All family members of the disaster victims in Shanghai should attend the trial in court. (2) Request the court to expedite the trial of this case within the possible scope. (3) Regarding the issue of litigation assistance, the court should consider the circumstances and approve the assistance. (4) Petition the National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to abolish all unequal treaties between China and Japan and cancel the navigation rights of Japanese ships.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao: I have read the report of the 10th of August of this year of the fourth section of your newspaper, "Local News Two", which contains an article about the seduction of a pregnant woman and the forced abortion. Inside it stated that Ren Jiarong of the Zhabei Mindelu, and his wife Ren Zhang, apprehended Xie Zhihong, Fang Keshan, Jin Bingxi, and the other three people, and they were sent by the Second Precinct of the Fourth District to the local court for investigation. After checking with this precinct there was no such case accepted, so the report is all fabrication. Correspondingly, I ask your honorable editor to publish this letter in the "Letter to the Editor" column to correct it. Sincerely, I wish you good writing, Shanghai Public Security Bureau Fourth District Second Precinct, August 12th, 20th year.</p>

<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Sea Rover</p>
<p>The Inventors of Four Things</p>
<p>One day in London, a gentleman wearing glasses, a soft felt hat, and a cork leg hobbled onto a public carriage. A good educator took this as good material to test the common sense of his students. He asked who invented the glasses, cork leg, public carriage, and soft felt hat.</p>
<p>The inventor of the glasses was an Italian named S.D. Armati, born in the thirteenth century. There is a house on a street in Florence, marked with a stone by the Technicians' Association to commemorate him.</p>
<p>Originally, artificial legs were not made of cork. Later, Dr. Cork invented the use of cork for manufacturing them, which made them much lighter for the disabled. However, the English word for cork is "Cork," and the inventor's name just happened to be Cork. This is too much of a coincidence. Perhaps his name was misspelled.</p>
<p>The public carriage was a French invention. In 1667, the great philosopher Pascal had the privilege of operating public carriages in Paris. However, although they were public, there were restrictions. Only members of the upper class were allowed to ride. Soldiers and servants were generally rejected.</p>
<p>Felt was invented by the Tartar people thousands of years ago. Almost all of the houses, clothing, bedding, etc. in North Asia are made of felt.</p>
<h3>Record of an Unusual Meteorite</h3>
<p>— Changsheng</p>
<p>In the sixth year of the Republic, I served in the army in Jialing and was ordered to temporarily serve as the magistrate of Langzhong for only seventeen days. With ample time after official duties, I wandered around the mountains and rivers. The place was the Zhengnan Gate, which had been closed for many years. People came and went through the East and West Gates. Outside the East Gate was the Great Silk Market. In previous years, magnificent houses lined the streets, but due to years of war, there were only rubble and hills. Simple sheds were built on the original sites to meet the needs of the market. The silks on display were all coarse and inferior. As it was approaching summer, I selected several pieces of silk to make summer clothes. Going out of the West Gate, less than a hundred steps away, was the Wanyuan Dam. The construction of this dam was very peculiar. It sloped down like a shark fin or stone steps. Steps were carved into a ladder. It was about thirty li long. There were countless stone rhinoceroses in the water, chanting in the wind and howling at the moon, swallowing and spitting out waves. It was truly a useful tool for preventing floods and a powerful enemy for fighting dragons. This place was the Jialing River. In the past, when Emperor Ming of Tang fled the rebellion of An Lushan, he traveled far to western Sichuan. He had passed by the Jialing River and admired it endlessly. Later, he ordered Wu Daozi to paint it on a screen. At that time, his entourage, such as Du Fu, were all exiles in Lizhou and wrote many poems. The current Shi Kuige Pavilion is located downstream of the Wanyuan Dam. There is a copper rhinoceros outside the pavilion. The pavilion houses the Lord of Sichuan, a beardless youth with a face like a beautiful woman. Two inscriptions are written with Du Fu's Shi Kuige poem. The handwriting is the same as He Zijhen's biography of the black woman, but it is unsigned. I dare not be sure. Behind the courtyard is a meteorite stone, about two feet high. Touching it, it is slightly warm. The words "Meteorite" are engraved on it. The history of the meteorite is written on the wall. In February of the fourteenth year of Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty, a star fell on the Shi Kuige Pavilion. The remaining fire shot in all directions, and the buildings were reduced to ashes. For more than a month, no one dared to pass by. In the eighth year of Yongzheng, a great flood occurred. With the remaining labor from repairing the dam, the Shi Kuige Pavilion was rebuilt, and the meteorite was placed in the temple as a permanent memorial. There are many meteorites in various provinces. They are only seen in books and history. None of the stones remain. Only the Tongjing in Beijing has a fallen star stone. According to an old man nearby, "it glows at night." However, the Tongjing's fallen star stone crumbles when cut. As for the Shi Kuige Pavilion's meteorite, it is harder than iron and its texture is different from stone. Although the words "Meteorite" are engraved on it, it only has a rough form. This is a meteorite that I have personally seen. The stone is still in the Shi Kuige Pavilion in Langzhong. Those who pass by can go there in person. Not only are the mountains and rivers beautiful and the historical sites famous, but the meteorite is also worth lingering over for days. Across the river is Jinping Mountain, where Zhang Daoling and his wife attained enlightenment and ascended to heaven on the same day. A few hundred steps further is the South Gate. There is a couplet on the gate: "Three hundred li of Jialing River, Twelve Buildings in the Garden." This is a factual record.</p>
<h3>A Strange Wedding</h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>British famous photography journalist Mr. Hu Bu published an essay "A strange wedding" on the April London newspaper. The content described the wedding Hu Bu witnessed when he was travelling in Buza (a kind of half-civilized Hui minority group). It is rather interesting, and translated as follows.</p>
<p>I (the author's pronoun, similar below) only just entered their village and I felt an odd mood. Let alone their houses, they were the same as in primordial times. They were constructed of very thick bamboo held together, high off the ground. The building materials were all grass and mud. From far away they resembled a bird's nest. Everyone's clothing, whether man or woman, all wore a kind of shining, and also red, green, and other colors, robe that went all the way to the ground. The style of the clothes was not like the Chinese's clothing, nor like a monk's clothing. There were seven stitches and eight patches, and I did not know how they made it.</p>
<p>It just so happened that the second day I was there, I encountered them holding a wedding. Therefore, I got to witness a bizarre wedding. Normally outsiders are not allowed to participate. Later, I do not know how many procedures were undergone, many flattering things were said, and many valuable gifts were given, before they allowed me. Their relatives and friends had to stay at the groom's house for at least two days. During these two days, they ate, drank, and danced to their heart's content, as if it were an earned right.</p>
<p>They viewed marriage as an extremely important event in their lives. Therefore, they took it very seriously. But most of them were poor. The groom had to save money and use it sparingly for several months before marriage. If it was temporarily not enough, he had to borrow money to pay for the wedding expenses. The bride did not need to borrow money, but she had to provide the groom with the money she had saved up on ordinary days to prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most was that the bride's father carried the bride on his shoulders and walked down the bamboo ladder step by step, while the groom supported her right hand. The groom was only seventeen years old, and the bride was twenty years old. Looking at their appearance, they seemed like a pair of siblings. (Because their houses are high off the ground, they had to use ladders to go up and down). She didn't look like an ordinary woman at all. Her hair was styled with an unknown headdress in a never-before-seen way. Her lips were painted as red as blood. Her eyelids were painted blue. According to their customs, the bride's feet must not touch the ground. Within three days of the wedding, she always sat on the shoulders of her father or uncle. She also had to keep her eyes tightly closed. Only on the fourth day could she open them. Otherwise, unexpected misfortune would befall the newlyweds.</p>
<p>Then, her father sat her on a high chair. The groom stood on the left. Relatives and friends surrounded them, shouting and dancing, like a large group of injured beasts howling and jumping in anger. Thus, the wedding was completed. A pair of strangers became husband and wife.</p>
<h3>A Description of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Miao Yu</p>
<p>When I first came to Shanghai, I couldn't help but be filled with eager admiration. Now that I've lived here for a long time, I've begun to realize that Shanghai is worthy of cursing. I recall a friend, Su Feng, who wrote a new-style poem satirizing it. The words went: "The first day, I saw the busy crowds. The second day, I saw the leaping gold. The third day, I saw demons and monsters. After that, I never saw any light." Although not a detailed description, it is extremely insightful.</p>
<p>Shanghai society is almost a large entertainment arena. The masses in society are all actors in makeup taking the stage. There are so many plays performed. The social news in the newspapers, page after page, are all scripts. However, this is only a kind of comical imagination. In fact, it is rare to see a penetrating depiction of Shanghai society on the stage or screen. Why is this?</p>
<p>First, old playwrights like to make superficial observations. For example, when describing a dancer, they only know that she is a dancer, without asking how she became a dancer. Or, when describing the life of a dancer, they only know that she revolves around music and lights, without asking about her inner heart and the bitterness of tears. Thus, they beat around the bush, and the taste is like chewing wax.</p>
<p>Second, old playwrights only care about the excitement and disregard the intricacies of the plot. For example, when describing a dance hall, the hair ornaments and clothing, the overlapping shoes, this is certainly lively. However, dancing with each other without any twists and turns, what meaning is there?</p>
<p>Therefore, a good playwright does not focus on one aspect in their description, and the plot does not adhere to one side. They make the script as blazing as fire, the plot as cloudy as mist. They make the actors like dragons soaring into the sky. Thus, it is lively and tortuous, and the actors can fully express their genius, and the script is thus successful.</p>
<p>Today's Chinese cinema has also been immersed in the tide of sound films. We see the shortcomings of Western sound films, which lie in only desiring excitement and neglecting the plot. Therefore, the way to success for domestic sound films is to vigorously correct this flaw. Recently, the Star Film Company produced a large sound film, "Such is Paradise." It is purely based on Shanghai society as the background and makes a subtle satire. Now that this film is about to be released, I hope that it will not be bombarded by viewers with the words "sensual" and "glamorous." What can make people unwilling to miss this good film is that this film's power can naturally evoke wild laughter and natural tears, and once again allow people to obtain endless satisfaction and return home, forever engraved in their minds, and say with a refreshing feeling, "Such is paradise, such is paradise."</p>
<h3>Indian Travelogue (79)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>The great Muslim writer Mirza Abullazl gifted me his work, "The Biography of Muhammad and a Record of Muhammad's Words and Deeds." I use it to understand the life of Muslims. I wish Chinese people would know that it is difficult for Muslims and Indians to get along, but Muslims and Chinese people can easily assimilate. I have studied the books on the nature of the universe in the Muslim religion and know that its origins are similar to those of Daoism in their tranquility. Its systems of governance and military laws are similar to Confucianism. Respect for heaven and ancestors, strength and self-reliance, are similar to the Yellow Emperor's founding of the country and the wise rulers of the Han and Tang dynasties. Its rule over Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia for one or two thousand years continues to flourish and cannot be easily disregarded. Whether Russification can be carried out in Europe will depend on Germany. Whether it can be carried out in Asia will depend on the Muslims. As for the situation of the Indian people, they are the most enthusiastic about being close to China. Even towards the Japanese, there is some insincerity because they are narrow-minded and think of seizing things. The Chinese are just a middle ground. They can unite the Buddhist, Indian, and Muslim races, then Asia will be easy to unite. If America is added, then Asia will be united. The Europeans will join last and the situation of the world's grand union will be set. The novice monk Shenxin told me that the principles of world aesthetics like complexity and dislike simplicity. If people combine various sects and priests of various religions to organize, then they can also be beautiful. For thousands of years, China has only talked about the three religions. I am concerned about its narrowness. Now it is appropriate to add the Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religions to make five religions. Also, adopt the strengths of Marx, etc., to apply them to our people's livelihood doctrine to achieve the great union. This is the responsibility of us Chinese people. If we want to achieve great unity, we must start from intermarriage between different races, religions, and classes. Then everything will be resolved and assimilated.</p>
<p>The study of the Muslim invasion of India has two causes: one is going from the northwest and southeast to plunder its resources; the other is to spread Islam. Therefore, wherever they went, the Indian and Buddhist religions were destroyed without remainder. To this day, the Indians are not happy with its rise. From Arabia, Arabia is the meaning of language, the meaning of wasteland and desert. When Islam rose, Arabia was polytheistic, with women being kidnapped into prostitution. If there were people who practiced monogamy, they would be ashamed because they were poor and lowly. Women's status was very low. The custom of killing daughters was prevalent. They worshiped gods of the sun, moon, stones, and trees. There were three levels of moon goddesses: one was the black moon, one was the white moon, and one was the middle-level moon. When people died, a female camel was tied to their tomb, not given food or drink, and left to die because it would serve them. There was also Christianity, but at that time it was corrupt and mixed with polytheism, which could not be avoided. Based on this kind of scene, and with each department under foreign rule, the monotheism of the Muslims rose in response. It is said that when Islam rose, the world was extremely unrestrained and degenerate. I see that Muslims pray several times a day, and the long prayers involve more than a hundred prostrations. This is training for the spirit of the army, and hard work and creation are not easy. Japanese people comment on Lenin as being the Muhammad of the 20th century, meaning that he was hardworking. The asceticism of Hinduism tends towards gentleness, while the endurance of Islam is attributed to strength. The bitterness of human life is the same.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Rotary Club</p>
<h3>Women, Women (18)</h3>
<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>Xiao Rong couldn't hold back anymore. He had already forgotten that he was his parents' son, his wife's husband, and only knew that he was Miss Ding's lover. He actually raised his voice to his father and said, "Don't make a fuss with me! Don't even give me face! To be honest, that woman has a lot of money! If I keep staying in this house, do you want me to pull a rickshaw? You can't control me! Huh!"</p>
<p>"Shameless! How could you say such a thing! We sent you to Shanghai to study, not to be a gigolo! What does it matter if she has money! Besides, you can't be so brazen! Think about it! When you came back the day before yesterday, what did you take out with you? Your face doesn't deserve such nonsense!" Xiao Rong's father finally burst into abuse. Xiao Rong's mother really couldn't stand it either. She said, "Xiao Rong! I always thought you were a serious scholar! Who knew you would say such absurd things! You never come home with a good face, but you come back to make your parents suffer! Think about it, you've been in Shanghai for a year. How much money have you spent? Where did all that money come from? Now don't talk so fiercely! Just return the pieces of gold jewelry you took the day before yesterday, and I'll let you go enjoy yourself! It's like, having a son like you is worse than not having one at all!" She was so angry that her voice trembled.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong was somewhat embarrassed and angry. Although he knew he was wrong, he didn't want to admit a single mistake. He just said, "Fine! Why bother like this? If I don't come back, you send the shop assistant to look for me. When I come back, you bang the table and slap the bench and give me a lecture! Fine! I don't want to listen!" As he spoke, he flew out the door.</p>
<p>"Wait! You can't leave!"</p>
<p>"Don't let Xiao Rong leave!"</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's father and mother both chased after him, but he was nowhere to be seen. They turned back angrily, one sighing, one crying bitterly.</p>
<p>Not long after, Xiao Rong's wife also returned with her flower basket. Auntie Matchmaker told her everything that had just happened, and she cried in anger too.</p>
<p>Later, after everyone discussed it, they felt that they had to find Xiao Rong and bring him back. Xiao Rong's wife volunteered and immediately rushed to the Railway Hotel. Fortunately, she usually went there to sell flowers every day, so everyone inside was very familiar with her. When she arrived at the Railway Hotel, she first asked the cashier, "Are there two guests here—a man and a woman—who came from Shanghai yesterday? The man is wearing a yellow suit, and the woman has permed hair and is wearing a red cheongsam. What room are they in?"</p>
<p>The cashier saw that it was the woman who often came to sell flowers, thought for a moment, and said, "Yes, there are. They're probably in room thirty-two. It's just that they've already returned to Shanghai today!"</p>

<h3>Gold Price Drops Eight Taels</h3>
<p>Fluctuations Reached Over Ten Taels: Yesterday, the twelve markers of gold prices resumed their downward trend, and the state was chaotic and greatly volatile. From morning to noon, there were fluctuations of more than ten taels. In the afternoon, there was only a fluctuation of two or three taels. In the end, it fell by eight taels, a reverse of the two-day rise. There were mostly sellers in the market. The price opened low because silver bars suddenly rose. Afterwards, due to active buying, there was an effort to raise it from all directions. Since foreign exchange rates strengthened, they turned from weak to sharp, and again jumped over the 780 tael mark. Suddenly, it was heard that Mr. Pittman was returning to the United States from China and planned to request President Hoover to issue a plan to rescue silver prices. The market was panicked by this news. Each firm tended to sell off and a storm arose, going from bad to worse, and plummeting more than ten taels. Later, because it was Wednesday, there was no market for foreign exchange, so there were no special changes.</p>
<p>Formerly Hit by News: From the morning, the September opening fell 5.4 taels, at 776.2 taels. Large bars rose slightly by one-sixteenth. The forecast on the previous evening was that prices would not fall. Also, US stocks rose, but silver prices did not move. Thus, sellers were very vigorous. Tong Taichang, Senchang, Yongri, Changshun, Shunli, Wanxing, Bingxing, etc., all sold off. The price then fell to 73 taels, after which Yuanxing, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Wupin, Chengfeng, Yonyong, Yongheng, etc., all entered. The price was then raised by two or three taels. The initial quoted price was 75.78 taels, and the posted price was the same as before, then increased to 78.45 taels. Domestic English gold was stable, closing at 5625, and Zhengjin absorbed November at 5625. Not long after, Yongfeng, Tong Taichang, Daxing, Yonglai sold off. When the price retreated to 75.5 taels, Yongheng, Richang, Yifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Xinheng, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yong, etc., competed to buy, and English gold recovered, closing at only 4375, so in just half an hour it rose sharply by more than 7 taels. In between, there was a slight fluctuation of one or two taels, reaching 83 taels by 10:20 AM. Unfortunately, it was a flash in the pan and was about to decline. The bank was still willing to sell English gold at a halfpenny, and Fuyu, Hengyu, Yongfeng, Qianchang, Xiang, Yuanheng, Bingxing, Richang, Changsheng, Yong, etc., constantly sold off. Especially because the United States was about to open a bill to relieve the silver shortage, the industry suddenly showed a state of terror. The price then plunged more than ten taels in a waterfall-style fall until noon, finally reaching 70.03 taels. By the close, it was 72.2 taels, and it continued to do business at 2.5 to 3 taels. The posted price was 819 taels, and the small difference was from 43 to 44 taels to 36 to 37 taels. The noon close was 47 taels.</p>
<p>No Major Changes in the Later Market: The afternoon market opened at 71.5 taels, followed by 1.2 taels. Afterwards, the Indian exchange rate rose in the near term and fell in the long term, reaching 73.5 taels. Then it was suppressed by seven or eight cents, and Fuxing, Yong, and Richang came to enter. At 2:15 PM, it was 74.8 taels. After that, there were slight advances and retreats, and the market was stable. Because there was no market for exchange drafts on Wednesday, there were also few transactions on the desk. Until after 3:00 PM, there seemed to be more sellers, retreating to 2.78 taels. In an instant, the wind and clouds rose, and the Indian exchange rate reported a small five anna. Qianchang, Xiang, Yuanmao, Yong, Yifeng, Yong, etc., took the stage and dropped their hands and entered. In just over ten minutes, the price increased by more than three taels, and at 3:30 PM, it was 76.2 taels. However, Tong Taichang, Shunli, etc., still sold off, so it was difficult to stand firm, and it fell again by more than three taels. At 4:15 PM, it was 72.8 taels. By the 4:30 PM close, it was 73.7 taels. Importantly, there was again a transaction of more than 4 taels, which was a head-covering entry, a pullback of 7.9 taels compared to the previous day (according to the listed price).</p>
<p>Spot Market Shape is Relatively Good: According to the maximum price of 83 taels for the whole day, and the minimum price of 70.03 taels, there was a difference of 12.7 taels. Goods were at 5.8 taels in the early morning market, 2 taels at the noon close, 1.8 taels in the afternoon, and 4.5 taels at the close. The posted price was from 47 to 44 or 45 taels, and registered at 70 to 72 taels. The water supplement was 7 taels, 72 taels in the afternoon. Spot red bars added 11 taels to 10.05 taels, better than the previous day. Yingfeng Heng bought more than 1,000 taels, which were sold by the same industry, and the firm resold 1,000 taels to the Tianjin gang.</p>
<p>Mostly Speculators Exiting: As for the transactions of each firm on the desk, Yuanmao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing, Yongheng, Xinheng, Futaiheng, Fuxing Yong, Chengfeng Yong, and Yuanxing Yong all entered. Senchang Yong, Richang, Tong Taichang, Shunli, Yongfeng, Bingxing, Daxing Yong, Qianchang Xiang, Yuanheng, Cuichang Yong, and Fuyu all exited. Yuantai, Chunyuan Yong, Hengchang Yong, Dadecheng, Yuandayong, Tianxiang, Yifeng Yong, etc., had many ins and outs. In the afternoon, Cuichang Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Qianchang Xiang, Yifeng Yong, Richang, etc., all entered. Wanxing, Yuantai, Yuanchun, Hengyu, and Dadecheng had different ins and outs. Yuanxing Yong, Tong Taichang, Shunli, and Huixiang all exited. The Dalian gang had a total of more than 3,000 bars, and the ins and outs were balanced (including hundreds of bars sold by foreign merchants). The Guangdong gang was still in a dormant state.</p>

<h3>Tight Money Eases</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, the monetary situation, after being tight for several days, suddenly invigorated people's hearts. However, it loosened again yesterday because the time for formal demand had not yet arrived. In addition, the financial sector has been cautious in recent years, so there is no concern about a lack of circulating funds in the market. Therefore, even when there is a tense situation, it is only temporary.</p>
<p>Discount Prices: (Silver Discount) The morning discount rate was comparable to the previous day's morning rate, calculated at 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 2 hao and a half. The afternoon market saw equal supply and demand, resulting in no significant change and remaining the same as the morning.

Because the silver discount rate was less than 1 qian, banks did not quote rates. The monetary trend seems to be stagnating again.</p>

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Continue to Rise Several Jiao</h3>
<p>Trend is Moderate with 1.5 Million in Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, besides the continued low volume of spot transactions in bonds, the futures market remained good. Initially, there was a temporary decline, but then the market fluctuated upward and became stronger. There were no large transactions by major players, and the balance between supply and demand was good. As a result, compared to the previous day, the market continued to rise, but only by about 0.2 to 0.3 角 (jiao, ten cents). The total daily spot trading volume was only 10,000 yuan, and the total futures trading volume for the morning and afternoon markets was 1.55 million yuan, with the internal unified tax and 20 Customs bonds each accounting for 4 to 5 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Situation Slightly Stabilized</h3>
<p>The yarn market trend is slightly stabilized because after a big drop, profit-takers are covering their short positions. In the 暗 (àn, dark/unofficial) market, there is a slight increase in demand for coarse yarn from Yunnan merchants, and the selling price is 3-4 taels higher than the standard yarn. Therefore, there is some intention to recoup losses, which is good. However, considering the world situation, there is no hope of a large increase. It would not be surprising if there were a slight pullback. The trend may temporarily fluctuate, but overseas cotton prices are very low, and there is still a large profit to be made from 10-count coarse yarn for textile mills. Therefore, some manufacturers are hedging forward positions. The future situation remains ordinary.</p>
<p>Major Players Covering Short Positions in 人標 (Rénbiāo, Shanghai Cotton Exchange Futures): In the morning session, American cotton fell slightly. There were fewer sellers in the market, and the atmosphere was slightly tight. Each month rose by one to two taels. In the second session, it fell again. In the third closing session, major players covered short positions and rose again. As a result, each month rose by 0.2489 qian. The afternoon market atmosphere was still tight. It was predicted that American cotton would rise yesterday, and each month rose by 0.459 qian. The trading volume was 49,250 bales. The sellers were 大孚 (Dàfú) 2,700 bales, 明德 (Míngdé) 1,000 bales, 公泰 (Gōngtài) 1,300 bales, 瑞大 (Ruìdà) 1,950 bales, 長豐 (Chángfēng) 2,000 bales, and 益昶 (Yìchǎng) 1,300 bales. The buyers were 梅記 (Méijì) 1,200 bales, 明德 1,200 bales, 恒德 (Héngdé) 1,250 bales, 益昶 2,050 bales, and 義餘 (Yìyú) 1,700 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>1,800 Bales of Yarn Sold: Spot yarn trading is still good. It is found that all merchants bought a total of 1,800 bales throughout the day. 650 bales were entered among colleagues. The market is relatively firm. Among the customer merchants, Sichuan entered 950 bales, the inland areas entered 150 bales, Guangdong entered 110 bales, Yunnan entered 150 bales, the North entered 100 bales, and miscellaneous merchants entered 100 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Relatively Moderate</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly stable, and the trend is more moderate than before. American cotton has fallen slightly by several pounds, but the overall situation remains calm because the combined price of foreign cotton is several taels lower than that of Chinese cotton. In addition, the prices offered by various foreign firms in the market are very accommodating. However, the factories are hesitant due to the adverse global situation, so there is little actual development. However, most people believe that the floods in various regions are becoming more severe, and American cotton is already at a low price, so there may be a rebound. Therefore, the public is still optimistic. However, the現貨 (xiànhuò, spot) price of American cotton with the middling grade is only equivalent to 31.36 taels in Chinese currency (this is the price in the United States), which is usually 10 taels higher than Chinese cotton because its quality and color are good and it can spin 42-count yarn or higher. The future of domestic cotton prices is still deteriorating. There may be a small fluctuation for the time being.</p>
<p>漢標 (Hàbiāo, Hankou Cotton Exchange Futures) Slightly Upward: In the morning session, Hankou Cotton Futures opened, and it was expected that American cotton would rebound tomorrow after a slight fall. There were fewer sellers, and each grade rose by 0.05 to 0.2 qian. In the afternoon, it rose again by 0.05 to 0.1 qian. The trading volume was 106,600 dan. The sellers were 振大 (Zhèndà) 2,500 dan, 泰興 (Tàixīng) 2,200 dan, 同興 (Tóngxīng) 2,000 dan, 餘昶 (Yúchǎng) 3,100 dan, 新豐 (Xīnfēng) 3,200 dan, and 大豐 (Dàfēng) 1,500 dan. The buyers were 公泰 3,400 dan, 梅記 2,600 dan, 長豐 2,900 dan, 源大 (Yuándà) 3,900 dan, 賡豐 (Gēngfēng) 2,700 dan, 協生 (Xiéshēng) 2,500 dan, 新豐 2,300 dan, and 益成 (Yìchéng) 2,100 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Slightly Soft, Three Categories Continue to be Firm</h3>

<h3>Grains: The Downriver Rice Market Is Explicitly Stable and Implicitly Firm</h3>
<p>South City: The arrival of goods from various merchant groups is lacking due to wind resistance, and the accumulation of water in the rivers is dwindling, resulting in a bleak atmosphere throughout the city. Transactions are sporadic. There is not much supply of indica rice from various places, and the inventory in Shanghai is low. In addition, there was a hurricane, and ships obstructed on the route are difficult to reach the port. If prices increase, the Social Affairs Bureau will send personnel to supervise the market and strictly prohibit further increases. They will also investigate the inventory, so the prices of goods can only temporarily remain at their original levels.</p>
<p>New Gate: The supply of Qingjiao (green glutinous rice), Suzhou, Changzhou, and other sources in the west road is still scarce. The sales of 洋蘆尖 (Yánglújiān, foreign pointed rice) are active among customer merchants, and the rice sales are also good. Prices have increased by 0.1 chi (approximately 1.1 inches). The price of thin indica and thick japonica rice has been set within a limited range since the market opened, and it is explicitly stable but implicitly firm. The assessment prices have not been officially published, but it is rumored that there are about 30 to 40 ships obstructed on the route. Foreign rice customer merchants and local sales seem to be slightly quiet.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Suddenly Plummets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of each month suddenly plummeted. There are two main reasons for the plunge. One is the surplus of American wheat, which is seen in detailed international telegrams. It is a matter of course that it will be dumped in China in the future. Second, domestic factories and small and medium-sized factories in Shanghai intend to purchase a large amount of American wheat, amounting to 200,000 tons. This news has spread widely among the inland merchant groups. This alarming rumor has frightened many inland bulls who are purely speculative. The volume of sales by factories reached 600,000 to 700,000 bags throughout the day. Therefore, the sharp rise of a few days ago was frustrated, and prices plummeted step by step. Looking ahead, if the trend of foreign wheat is not good, domestic disasters and natural disasters will inevitably be dominated by foreign forces. As a result, this month fell by 0.35, September fell by 0.425, October fell by 0.475, November fell by 0.45, December fell by 0.525, and January fell by 0.4.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Fall Consistently and Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of each month presented a state of sharp decline. With the alarming news of a surplus overseas, the purchase of foreign wheat seems to be no problem. In addition, large bulls gradually released their positions, and speculators seemed to have lost their central force. Therefore, the selling pressure in each month was extremely strong, and prices fell sharply step by step in each session. The next step is to look at the foreign wheat report and then determine the future trend. As a result, this month and September plummeted by 0.1 qian compared to the previous day, October fell by 0.09 qian, November fell by 0.1 qian, and December fell by 0.09 qian. The spot wheat market is still stable due to low inventory and active factory demand. 7,400 bags of Nanjing, Hezhou, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Penglai, Taicang, Shuangfeng, Weiting, Sijing, Zhintang, and other wheat were opened. Fuxin bought 1,700 bags, Shenda bought 2,400 bags, and Huafeng bought 3,500 bags.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Red Sugar Opens Exceptionally Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from the sugar market production area stated that the price of Cuban spot sugar had not changed from the previous telegram. New York sugar futures for September and December also lacked fluctuations. Prices for March and May of the next year each fell by 0.01. Java spot and futures sugar remained unchanged. At the association market, white sugar made from Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand was very quiet in buying. Ordinary goods were 11.45 taels, and slightly higher goods were 11.55 taels. White sugar made from No. 20 medium sand was 11 taels. Transactions were scarce. The market was still firm. 太古 (Taikoo) B was 11.1 taels, DY was 11.95 taels, and demand was sluggish. HX was 11.85 taels, HM was 11.4 to 11.45 taels, and the trend was firm. More than 300 bags of O25 were opened at a price of 9.35 yuan. The market was also not weak. In the number盤, Bingchang sold more than 1,000 bags of No. 9 Dutch red sugar at a price of 9.45 yuan. The dealer's intention to buy was quite strong, and the market was exceptionally strong.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: The Screening Process of Guizhou Longan May Increase Again</h3>
<p>Longan is rare because the arrival volume is scarce, and the number of盤s is gradually increasing. In addition, the inventory has all been baked, and the cost has increased significantly. If it is still sold at the original price, it will inevitably result in losses. Based on the recent offer prices, the top-quality product has a cost of nearly 40 taels after further selection. Therefore, the industry association decided yesterday to increase the price of screened Guizhou longan across the board to maintain capital. The prices are as follows: top-quality sells for 38 taels, supreme-quality sells for 28 taels, super-quality sells for 22 taels, and split-open sells for 15 taels.</p>
<h3>Orchid Seeds Fall by One Tael</h3>
<p>Since the new orchid seeds came out, the number arriving has not been large because they are not yet the 正水 (zhèngshuǐ, peak season) goods. Therefore, the collection is limited. Yesterday, another ten or so boxes arrived on the Jinan round, and they have already been opened. The price has decreased by one tael compared to the previous盤. It is said that the 正水 goods may also enter the market in ten days. According to Hankou reports, this year's harvest is still abundant. If they pour in later, the market price may loosen.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Yuhang Autumn Silkworm Seed Preparation is Relatively Smooth</h3>
<p>Farmers in the Yuhang area, because the spring and summer silkworm crops this year were generally unsuccessful, are preparing to raise autumn silkworms to make up for the losses. They have ordered a large number of improved seed papers from the Provincial Sericulture Field and various seed production fields and have now paid for them separately. Farmers are now starting to select seeds in preparation for hatching.</p>
<h3>European Sales of Zhenmei Green Tea Continue to be Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, banks like Luzhuang Tuzhuang were involved in Zhenmei green tea, with companies such as Xiehe Yihé Tongfu Yongxing showing strong interest. The prices of goods from Wudong Tunxi and other regions have already increased to 120-130 taels. The market is extremely firm. For Gongxi items, the Russian Assistance Association is very interested. Baitouzhuang and China Tea Company also have demand. The trend in the tea market is increasingly optimistic.</p>
<h3>Silk Sales in Europe and America Still Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign banks in Shanghai still showed no improvement. It was found that silk sales in the European and American markets were not improving, and telegrams were silent. The market atmosphere was stagnant. Only Zhonghe bought 15 bales of white dried silk, and Xinfu bought 20 bales of gray dried silk. Prices remained firm.</p>
