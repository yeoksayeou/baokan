<p>關於研究日本問題之重要。國内學者。固亦不少精闢痛切之論。然而言者諄諄。聽者漠然。國人於此。終覺羗無足重。方之日本之對我研究。政府提倡於上。國人努力於下。多數學者專家。均竭力以赴。惟恐不及。其相差誠不可以道里計。蔣夢麟先生對於國人之對日態度亦曾有痛切之言。曰「四十年來。吾國對於日本態度。凡三變甲午以前則輕視。甲午以後則師事。自二十一條要求發生以後。則仇視。因輕視而致甲午之敗。因師事而起革新運動。仇視之極。復轉爲輕視。夫以近世學術而言。日不如歐美。其採他人之長。能與己國民族之風相融和。亦具有特點。豈吾人所宜輕視。故吾人對於日本。宜加以深切之研究。其理由不僅知己知彼已也。淺見者流。未聞彼邦近所以來學術進步之速。而談及日本。輒表輕視之態。似不足研究者。嗚呼。吾人已忘甲午之前車乎。」斯言之痛切。發人深省。夫日本立國海内。初本爲赤條條一無所有之民族。自我國文化輸入。然後始有文化可言。此固爲不可否認之事實。然而明治而後。勵精圖治。銳意維新。取東方之精神文明與西方之物質文明。融會貫通。治於一爐。使其能適應自己生活。合於己用。同時其國人都一心一德。刻苦踐實。爲國家爲民族而工作。孜孜不息。此種向上之民族精神。鞭策其國家日臻於興隆維新以後之日本。已遠非六○七年小野妹子出使我國輸入文明時之日本。我國旣昧彼國情。復夷狄目人夜郎自大甲午之役。彼知我旣明準備尤足。我於彼乃毫無所知。姑無論彼之向外發展計劃。外交方針及彼之國情民隱。卽彼當時之軍備。亦復昩然。人已决意作戰。我仍一再言和。其輕人昧人。有如是者。不敗詎豈能得此國人輕日之所以致甲午之敗也。甲午敗後。國人乃震於隣近新興民族之威燄。向之輕視者。今乃師視之。於是派員考察也。送人留學也。國内之實業軍備。皆聘請日人顧問指導也。孜孜於效法日人。幾以此爲興國之大道。風之所趨。乃起有淸光緒年間之革新運動。此固不能不謂爲師視之較好現象。然而師其皮毛。而忽其實質。究其外形。而昧其内隱。謂爲羨日則有之。但决不能謂。爲知日。而且當時派往日本留學之學生。多習軍事與速成法政。歸國而後。其能卓然以救國爲己任者。固不乏人。而略習軍事與速成法政。歸國後遂爲軍閥。爲政客。流毒我國家社會。爲我國近二三十年來擾亂政治之主角者。亦復不少。此師視之結果也。民四日對我提出無理之二十一條。國人憤日至極。乃轉而仇視。萬口一聲。紛言救國雪恥。且日作正義公理之呼籲。求援於列强。呼助於於華會。但於如何以探日人之隂謀。如何以曉日人之實力。如何以究日人之弱點。則終不注意。甚至以仇日之故。馴至不欲見日人。不欲習日語。不欲一聞日本政治。與日作一切接觸。仇日愈甚。隔閡愈深。以故民四而後。國人日言抗日。而國内鬩牆之禍變迭起。日人之侵我凌我亦愈熾。此則仇視之結果也。綜上而觀。則輕日。師日。仇日。皆不足以自衞。不足以禦侮。欲謀自衞與禦侮惟一之道。厥惟知日。外交官之應知日。固無論矣。卽國内之一般民衆。甚至幼小學生。亦應對日有相當之常識。先能知人。夫然後可以自衞。夫然後可以折挫日人之氣燄與野心。近年來日人怵於蘇聯國力之日張。寖且爲其近鄰之勁敵。爲事先之準備計。對蘇聯之研究。如組織學會也。發行月刋也。編譯叢書也。朝夕孜孜。力求知彼。以求將來角勝負於疆場。其用心之遠。見解之深。是則眞可令我國人警惕者也。</p>

<p>紅軍組織以僞中華蘇維埃共和國中央革命軍事委員會爲最高指揮機關、軍委會下分設長江軍事委員會及南方軍事委員會兩辦事處、及鄂豫皖·湘鄂邊·贛東北·廣西右江·閩粤贛·海南島、六分區軍事委員會、其軍隊之實力、各方調查、殊不一致、去年秋間之調查、共有十四軍、兵士約七萬人、步槍約有五萬枝、據高瞻君本年三月在江西共禍概况中之估計、則謂紅軍至少有八萬枝槍二十萬人、（見産共半月刊）照今年春間所破獲之「蘇維埃區目前工作計劃、」則已改編成七軍、</p>

<p>▲地理</p>
<p>丨第二　作業要項</p>

<p>（二）教法要項應加注意報章一項、「理由」一·地理上變遷很多、卽以地名而言、亦常有更改、例如奉天今爲瀋陽、君士坦丁、今改爲士坦保爾、至於國際關係及世界各國物質上的新建設、更是日新月異、所以對於報章應特别注意、二·倘能注意報章、那麽因收回中東路而引起的交涉戰爭有新的地理材料可得、再能因研究中東鐵路問題、而細閱滿洲至東三省地理、則所得更大、</p>

<p>（一）教材大綱與時間分配不聯貫且大富彈性「理由」教材大綱與時間分配不相聯絡、且太富彈性、有標準等於無標準、</p>
<p>（二）世界地理教材　除注重與中國最有關係的六國外、對於弱小民族、似宜亦加注意、「理由」一·總理曾詔示我們要達到中國之自由平等、必須聯合世界上以平等待我之民族、共同奮鬥、所以對於一切弱小民族、應視爲與六國有同等關係而加注意二·弱小民族的土地、大半爲帝國主義者之殖民地殖民地獨立、更足以使帝國主義者崩潰、所以注意弱小民族、亦卽注意日美英法等國家、</p>
<p>▲算術</p>
<p>丨第一　目標丨</p>
<p>（一）高中算學目標似宜加一養成學生平心靜氣解决困難問題之習慣、使能遇艱難而不畏懼、遇失敗而不灰心「理由」高中生學習算學、除力求實用外、宜養成其奮鬥之勇氣、解决困難問題之精神、庶可進求高深學術或努力服務於社會、</p>
<p>丨第二　教材大綱丨</p>
<p>（一）高中算學大綱關於代數之方程式組（丑）項下、應加行列式之普通定理及應用一項、「理由」行列式爲解一般一次聯立方程式之通法、在解析幾何中必須應用且應用甚廣、故宜加授、</p>
<p>（二）關於幾何丁·項二次曲線、似應删去、併入解析幾何中、「理由」在歐几里得幾何中識二次曲線、不易明瞭、轉費時間、在解析幾何中講授、則頗爲適合、否則若於立體幾何後、卽講二次曲線、不獨頭腦不淸、且未免於解析幾何有重複之弊、</p>
<p>丨第三　時間支配</p>
<p>（一）初中算學時間分配似宜改爲左表所列</p>
<p>一學年　二學年　三學年</p>
<p>每週時數　每週時數　每週時數</p>
<p>上學期　算五　代五　代二幾三</p>
<p>下學期　算五　代三幾二　幾五</p>
<p>「理由」用分科數學、依規定時間支配、一年級上學期、五小時算術、下學期二小時算術、三小時代數、但算術取材方面、旣須與小學算術銜接、而加以擴充、尤須揷入與日常生活之知識和經騐、有關係之應用練習如珠算等、材料旣多、學生程度以小學生短少一年、尤今非昔比、初中第一年上下學期、均改爲五小時算術、而將代數之基本概念、正負數簡易方程式等、在講授算術時預示一條、引入代數的途徑、覺得根基較爲堅固、無半生不熟雜而不專的弊病、則二三年級上學期、專習代數三年上學期、以代數與幾何混合教授、至三年下學期則專習幾何而三角、擬待高中待之初中、暫不加入、</p>
<p>（二）高中算學似應爲二十學分、「理由」高中算學、依總表有十九學分、依分表僅有十八學分、故知中間必有錯誤、但照屬校三學期之試騐結果、總覺時間不足、不易將課程標凖中教材大綱如期授畢、擬定爲二十學分、將第四學期三角加一學分、解析幾何、减一學分、第五學期解析幾何改爲四學分、</p>
<p>丨第四　作業要項一</p>
<p>（一）高中算學作業要項内、應加實際應用三角測量附近學校各地、「理由」測量學直接應用三角爲訓政時期建設工作之故、學三角時注意於測量、直接爲推廣學理於應用、間接爲養成從事職業之技能、</p>
<p>▲理化</p>
<p>丨第二　時間支配</p>
<p>（一）鑛物與化學似應分别教學、「理由」鑛物附入化學師資難覓、似應分别教學、惟此種分别教學、須同時進行、以便互相聯絡、</p>
<p>（二）高中理化生物教授程序當有規定、「理由」高中物理化學及生物三項、其教授程序、尚未規定、據試騐結果、以高中一授生物、高中二授化學、高中三授物理、最爲合宜、</p>
<p>丨第五　教法要點丨</p>
<p>（一）高中物理、甲、原文、（一）每週講一小時末後十五分鐘、應表演試騐、宜改爲每講一單元時開始、或末後十五分鐘、應表演試騐、「理由」依據實騐結果、物理學教材、每一小時不盡能完全講畢一單元、故每一小時不能皆有不同之表演、且末後表演可以證明學理之眞確、開始表演、可以利用好奇心、以引起研究之興趣、均宜分别採用（二）高中物理原文、（三）每週提出一小時以質問答解題或考試、宜改爲每章授畢、提出一小時、以質問答解題或考試、（理由）每週教授僅三小時若再提出一小時作考試及問答之用、則講授時間、僅爲每週二小時、不獨規定教材不易授畢、且考試材料亦嫌太少、片段舉行、不易得系統概念、</p>
<p>▲動物學植物學</p>
<p>丨第一　時間支配丨</p>
<p>（一）初中動物學植物學至少應增加一學分、「理由」初中植物學動物學時間支配、原定各爲三學分、照所訂教材大綱及教學方法試教、恒感時間不足、倘欲减少教材、而適合時間、則以所訂教材、均甚適切、未便割愛、故據實騐結果、至少需各增加一學分、卽共爲八學分、（完）</p>
<p>明日决定擾　、錄取新生恐難　額、尚須在八月中旬舉行第二次新生入學考騐云、</p>
<h3>樹人中學之新發展</h3>

<h3>商大得勢跑隊四分慘敗</h3>
<p>▲三五比三一</p>
<p>▲今晚無比賽</p>
<p>日本茵大籃球隊、昨晚爲來滬第三戰、跑隊以四分之差、遭其毒手、比數三十五比三十一、裁判員瞿鴻仁、今日商大休息、</p>
<p>▲隊伍不齊　跑隊之敗、在於不曾整軍應戰、何炎章、飲冰過量、不能賣力、關毅魏佐翰又往粤、故技術雖高、合作稍疏、上半時輸三分、十五比十二、總結果負四分、</p>
<p>▲一般意見　商大此來、華隊已二敗其手、技術雖較高明、隊伍不甚整齊、以致不能充分合作、以後作戰、應以量强精兵出戰、以免日人以爲上海華人籃球之不過如此也、</p>

<h3>天津網球賽慶慶隊雙勝</h3>
<p>▲林寳華大失衆望</p>
<p>天津十八日電　日本慶應網球隊、十八日下午四時與津選手比賽、觀衆較十七九擁擠、天氣酷熱、汗下如雨、</p>
<p>▲兩組結果</p>
<p>出田（日）七比五　六比二　大倫强（津）</p>
<p>山岸志村　（日）七比五　六比一　五比七　七比五　林寳華　吳少香（津）</p>
<p>▲比賽情形</p>
<p>單打日隊山田、與津隊大倫强、第一盤七比五日勝、小倫强因熱頭暈、休息十分、勉强應戰、結果六比二仍敗、雙打日隊山岸志村、與津隊林寳華吳少香、第一盤七比五、第二盤六比一、第三盤因榮辱關係係竭力攻守、結果七比五、津隊勝、休息十分再戰、雙方各賈餘勇、冀爭最後勝利、終因林吳疲乏、失却機會不少、結果七比五、日隊勝、七時告終、林在前數年、頗負盛名、近年荒於嬉戲、技休退化、觀衆對林非常大爲失望、</p>

<p>范令　洛德（美）　六比一　六比四　四比六　六比三　休士　白里（英）</p>
<p>▲英國殂勢惡劣</p>
<p>第一日各勝一單打、今日美國勝雙打、美國遂以二比一佔優勢、最後二單打中、只須再勝一組、卽可得却令治權、英國須二組全勝、爲不可能事實、因温布敦賽中、奥斯汀敗於希爾士、而白里敗於伍特、英國得却金治權、已宣告失望、</p>
<h3>江南田徑隊北征記（三）</h3>
<p>丨在天津之五日丨</p>
<p>江南田徑隊在津五日、頗受津地體育界之歡迎與張伯苓先生之器重、茲將在津情形、述之如次、</p>
<p>▲好天氣突然放晴</p>
<p>▲一日　連日陰雨、塲地濘濕、不能比賽、故在昨晚抵站時、津體育界諸人已有請先赴遼寗之說、但未决定、不意一日晨、天大開慈顔、在各隊員尚在好夢正濃時、陽光已送入窗内、先赴遼寗之說、亦因之打消、是日除下午四時在南中大運動塲作輕渡之練習、</p>
<p>▲南開之美麗風景</p>
<p>▲二日　上午九時、由章輯五先生派代表引導全體隊員、至八里台參觀南開大學、八里台昔爲天津南郊之荒地、蘆茟森列、無人過問之處、今則經張伯苓先生之慘淡經營、建築南開大學、科學館、圖書館、秀山堂、以及男女宿舍等、均已先後築成、不僅爲北方最高學府、且八里台不十年亦已成爲津埠惟一之名勝矣、因南開校内一切布置、無異一大公園、重森蔭蔽、花卉羅列、使人入内大有樂不思蜀之慨、南開有此良好學風、此亦不無關係也、南開大學、四週多河、可以泛舟、在津人目中、無異杭之西湖、平之三海、每於夕陽西下之時、常可尋得中外男女、駕舟游覽、實爲一津埠社交之要處、隊員等參觀校舍、亦卽分乘四艇、漫遊勝處、旋卽在海光寺登岸、赴津體育協進會之午宴、席間由先津協會會長章輯五先生、及全國體育協進會會長張伯苓先生、先後致辭、大意謂江南北來、意在提倡田徑運動、冀各地均能聞風興起、最後由領隊王復旦致謝辭、而散、四時在南中作正式練習、各報記者、到塲參勸、并攝影焉、</p>
<p>▲張伯苓設宴歡迎</p>
<p>▲三日　準備明日與津隊作對抗賽、完全休息、隊員均不許外出、午刻由張伯苓先生個人設宴欵待、</p>
<p>▲四日　下午四時起與津地作對抗、其詳細情形已見報載、</p>
<p>▲五日　乘九時車赴平、</p>
<h3>我國棒球界之基本檀島華僑隊退化</h3>
<p>國人對於棒球一項、泰不注意、故每屆遠東輒遭失敗、我國旅居檀香山僑胞、對於棒球技術、早有深切研究、迄今業已廿餘年矣、並連年保持火奴魯魯全埠錦標、聲譽早已卓著於美洲、第八九兩屆遠東、我國體育界先輩王正廷氏、特招聘該隊代表祖國出席、果然兩次均獲亞軍、將吾國在國際上棒球地位略加提高一九二八年該隊曾擊敗日本全國冠軍之慶應大學隊、實力當可想見、上屆遠東、日人尚畏檀隊之强、以全國聯合軍而敗之、但昔檀隊之實力、較日本之任何大學單位爲强、因日本之慶應·早大·明治·法政均非其敵手、而較之日本全國聯軍、當然略有遜色、惟該隊之隊員、俱因年齡過高近來練習生疎、致技術異常退化、本月十二日、日本明治大學棒球隊遠征檀島、在火奴魯魯舉行中日國際棒球比賽、觀者萬人、激戰之結果、華僑隊以一比十二慘敗、按明治並不甚强、在日大學中爲第四流、華僑隊失敗於彼、可見退步多多、亦爲吾國棒球界基本之搖動、</p>

<h3>金融　上週標金　變動力甚强</h3>
<p>▲隨德國債事消息爲轉移</p>
<p>上週標金續趨上峰、惟變動力擴大、殊多波折、日有十餘兩起仆、初盤旋於七百四十兩内外、後曾越出七百五十兩關、狀態複雜離異、人心猶豫不定、詢爲德國借欵及財政之不安消息紛歧、故市場空氣良萎靡常、適逢交易所開始掉期、以九月份價比八月爲高、故由空頭貼進、初爲五錢、旋後漲至三兩數錢、乃多方以被壓迫、聞廣帮·恒興及長做現貨號家均未掉妥、而俟八月一日起、照解公單（現貨）查七月份所收進之貨、目下約存三萬條之譜、殆八月份期標自週初曾漲至七百五十兩、週四（十六日掉期日）最低爲七百三十兩○七錢、收市七百四十兩、比諸前週六計漲十一兩、而九月份初開七百三十九兩半、猝跌至三十二兩半、迨週末曾達五十四兩发䖝</p>
<p>錢、計有二十二兩四錢差額、結果四十七兩、而八·九月統核（在此週中）除掉其三兩餘、尚漲十四兩光景、蓋海外銀市報跌、又以滬市匯票亦掛縮一檔半、至於銀行實際交易之價、趨勢亦緊、華商時有扒塞、統核補空、據聞仍占空頭地位、乃套頭多標金焉、各號交易、如大連帮·萬興·順利·同太昌并投機商吳某等近日均有賣出、惟仍占多頭、至廣帮恒興·生大因某大戸旅行出外、故交易殊少、標金照日匯結價、初撳四十兩同儤</p>
<p>外、最小三十餘兩、終則四十餘兩、現貨赤條天津帮買意逾恒、惟前昨間因該帮有停止辦貨之說、故而减色矣、而價照期標遞加十三兩餘至十一兩餘、至德國債事未解决前、乃標金前途應有一番之劇變歟、茲將一週中英美印銀市及匯兌標金等高低價分述于后、</p>

<h3>證劵　上週債價跌三元左右</h3>
<p>▲全週忽跌忽漲趨勢混亂</p>
<p>▲成交達一萬二千餘萬元</p>
<p>上星期内本埠證劵市塲各債劵市况、現貨進出極淸、全週祇開出三萬九千元、内一九關佔一萬三千元、餘各祇數千元、期市始終活潑、重要各債劵、每日均有鉅額成交、計週一週三及週六諸日各開一千七八百萬、餘日達二千數百萬元、統計全週總成交數一萬二千令念二萬元、比前星期增二千七百數十萬元、内統稅庫劵雖已於週三開做交易、然是項庫劵、現尚絶鮮流通、故僅七月期貨做開一次、以後卽無交易、其他以二十年關稅爲最旺、成交達四千零八十九萬、二十年捲烟次之、計二千二百念三萬元、一九關一千四百四十三萬、九善一千二百九十五萬五千元、裁兵一千二百三十五萬、編遣一千一百十四萬、餘如關稅二百三十二萬五千元、九六二百十二萬、整六一百七十一萬五千元、七年六萬元、統稅祇五千元、至言變動情形、則以時局略有變化、市上屢有謠言、債市環象、似不如前、加之北帮陸續抛售甚力、市塲人氣頗虛、各債劵在週初時卽疲、如二○關跌二元、二○捲一九善亦跌一元餘、週二復小一元左右、週三人心觀望、價最呆滯、惟週四以市上石所軍反動謠言、市面頓呈緊張、售出旣旺、價跌亦烈、最低時曾降二元半至三元許、週五以連日下跌太巨、且市上傳言、不免失實、人心轉佳、投資乘低收進、殊不乏人、一九關善、二○關捲等各抬漲一元八九角、裁兵編遣亦漲頗巨、週末一日、趨勢已轉平和、僅二○捲仍回低一元、其他上落甚微、結果較前星期下跌二三元左右、僅七年整六九六等較爲穩定、債市形勢已覺混沌焉、茲將高低漲落統計列後、（單位元）</p>

<p>紗市在上週初漲勢頗銳、大有愈趨愈高之象、蓋拒貨運動、日見劇烈、投機家蜂擁而來、塲中購進者踴躍、同時各帮亦爲未雨綢繆計、購買愈旺、如津帮爲内地兩帮採辦現貨、益覺熱烈、故標紗漲風兇猛、星期二飛漲四兩光景、旋以某商且不限價抛出、抬面略覺鬆懈、至於海外花紗狀况呈平靜之局、金價亦盤旋、週末因大戸抛賣不絶、市價稍見回落、標紗價各月比前週漲二兩外、全週成交計三十四萬一千八百包、現紗生意暢達、北銷最健、故十六十四二十支現紗異常緊俏、行情日見堅挺、全週各帮買去統計二萬零六百六十五包、同行中進四千一百包、茲將各帮買去最額分誌於後、</p>

<h3>上週棉市黯淡無神</h3>
<p>▲多空兩難之局</p>
<p>▲現棉堪云停頓</p>
<p>棉市一週以來、毫無精彩可言、大有擯局之勢、蓋以海外棉市、亦呈徜徉之狀、而匯兌雖長、國内始以各方報告有洪水災害之患、陜西棉有一部份受損、致人心提高一步、未幾夫時轉晴、而美棉狀况平澹、致市氣尤難上挺、而現棉銷路大滯、各廠均無辦胃、由此遂成多空俱難之局面、惟日商遠期吸進不動、包額殊巨、棉市變動、須待新棉及美棉情形爲進退也、標棉陳棉因收貨者較缺而疲、新棉日商不放稍堅、結果各月價比前週近平、遠漲二·三錢、成交計二十五萬八千九百担、查來源計姚花三千六百五十包、美棉與前週相仿云、</p>

<h3>外紗花堅疲不一</h3>
<p>昨日美棉初因利物浦消息良好而堅、旋因華爾街售出而疲、卒因同業買進再堅、計期貨漲跌一至四磅音、現貨不動、英棉期貨漲二點、現貨跌五點、埃及棉現貨跌十點、印棉空戸抵補、經紀商買進、計平果爾不動、奥姆辣跌○·一一五羅比、白羅溪漲一羅比、原電錄左、（十八日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市步鬆</h3>
<p>▲新閘　昨日早晨臨市者寥寥無幾、蘇常頂貨及中關回低二角、崑山·江隂白粳去路益淡鬆動一二角、南帮·石浦·重固·航船·西塘等晚稻、到湧胃淡、存積尚有、形勢各低近尺、蘆埠尖零銷不佳、情况平平、糯米酒作坊胃口全無、價格續低、早稻上棧雖有、惟數目極缺、價照原盤、西路來船二三十號、斛開二千擔光景、</p>
<p>▲南京　各帮來源尚多、約十念號、城鄉走銷淸淡、厚粳頂中二擋縮短二角、買氣極靜、人心看鬆、客方受其影響、薄稻到頭雖少、然去化甚滯、價亦回跌一二角、洋蘆尖呆而不動、形勢下遊、通變隂化明定暗跌、早稻隨到隨銷、價無上落、昨由安南來電、一星期内有十萬包洋米進口、故本埠米價步步看低、</p>
<h3>絲茶　婺源子茶大半停採</h3>
<p>婺邑子茶、本年出貨甚豐、且因茶號競爭搜買、價格抬高、各山戸貪價貴銷暢、莫不紛紛儘量採製、以冀多量之敷求、未幾滬市綠茶價跌不振之消息傳來、各號興趣頓减、稔愼之號、茶額雖未進滿、亦多不敢再進、致價遂趨下落、産茶最豐之北鄉山戸、以價跌銷狹、均各停止採製、惟婺東子茶、近日仍有採售、因東路各號需要未減出價仍在六十至六十五元之間、盤旋未降云</p>
<h3>屯溪子茶號需甚殷</h3>
<p>屯溪茶號、因本年休屬茶被蟲害、歙遂茶産額蝕收、進胃多未滿額、羣望子茶出産豐收、以補缺欠、故至子茶出新、各號儘量搶收、兼之首字珍眉運滬、以屯茶先到、得價最高、號心更異常熱烈、近日屯埠各茶行次貨存茶、開出盤價、尚有五六十元左右、對子茶葉質細嫩者、需需甚殷、出盤仍在六十至七十元、一般茶販、收辦子莊、咸紛紛運屯脫售、但日來茶區出貨漸稀、葉質亦日老、多半亦停止採摘、子茶市面、已無多日遺留云</p>
<h3>糖市　日糖因抵制挫跌</h3>
<p>▲粗砂白步升錢半且强</p>
<p>昨日公會劃盤荷糖二十四號粗砂白、買氣尚盛、初市成交價爲十一兩四錢、磨細砂白十一兩四錢半、後市粗砂白升十一兩四錢半、市形甚俏二十號中砂白十一兩、略次者十兩零九錢、趨勢亦挺、太古車糖Ｂ嘜十二兩、ＣＷ嘜十一兩八錢、ＨＭ嘜十一兩三錢、出戸極缺、市象甚俏、華新號開出Ｂ嘜一千包、價十二兩、又售出粗砂白數百袋、價十一兩四錢、日糖以寗波來電止裝、本埠對日經濟絶交、加緊工作、是以人氣轉弱、出戸愈衆、買方因鑒運輸及出貨或生問題、大都觀望、以致交易零落、市且略見下挫、Ｎ嘜價自十一兩二錢至一錢七分半、ＳＨ嘜十一兩零七分半Ｔ嘜十一兩六錢二分半至六錢、ＹＴ嘜十一兩一錢半、ＹＲＯ嘜十一兩零五分、ＹＰ嘜十一兩五錢半、ＴＫ嘜十一兩二錢半至二錢、ＴＭ嘜十一兩一錢半至一錢、趨勢且疲、號盤有禎祥號售開現貨香港粗砂白二千袋、價元十一兩四錢二分半、以四日出淸、行方進意殊濃、市極俏、大有步漲之勢云、</p>
<h3>五金　靑島帮收買七釐半鋼板</h3>
<p>七厘半英鋼板、昨靑島帮忽羣起收辦、故昨日被其購去七八百塊、行情每箱售六兩五錢、比前已提高一錢半、</p>
<h3>東白鐵因抵制而漲價</h3>
<p>自萬寳山案發生後、本埠同業異常憤恨、因之有抵制東貨之議、如東白鐵·新鉛絲·東釘·煤鍫等莫不在抵制之列、惟行情一節、昨日忽起漲風、揣考其原緣、因有少數收囤所致、如三七尺行情已抬高至一兩二錢六分、三六尺一兩零三分、均比前提高三分餘、而東釘·鉛絲等均各高起三四錢不等、惟客帮交易、除長江一帶有吃進外、别帮殊少採辦者云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　衆興菜金山枝登新</h3>
<p>▲價十九兩半　▲六十八兩半</p>
<p>首批新衆興菜昨日業已抵申、共額爲三百九十一包、均係各行自行辦來、當卽見樣、以地頭天雨關係、身色較遜、各帮聞訊、咸有採購、以廣帮成交爲多、價爲十九兩半、大約已有半數售出、此次來貨、如果是乾而黄亮者、售價尚可加、高、惜以天雨色遜、未能過俏、然預料星期一、亦可告罄矣、</p>
<p>正式新金山枝、昨日北號家到有聯生牌二十箱、貨品不過爾爾、然其重量僅七八擔之譜、故開價竟達六十八兩半、較之陳貨高起二十餘兩、本屆收成雖歉、惟市價過昂、去胃減少、是以後市能否站定、當以走場如何爲轉移也、</p>

<h3>世界小事紀</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>生蛋十七年的老母雞</p>
<p>英國約克府的史基泊頓</p>
<p>鎭Ｓkipton　Yorkshire有一頭老母雞。簡直是打破了全世界母雞生蛋的紀錄。伊自入世以來。已十七年了。因此大家都稱伊爲「老太太」。「老太太」生殖力極强。十七年如一日。伊的主人在十一年前將伊置到家中時。本來不希望伊生蛋。只要伊坐在鴨蛋上孵出小鴨來好了。誰知小鴨出世下水之後。伊自已也會生起蛋來。從此每年四月中旬。就開始生蛋。一連總是六七個禮拜。到此略略休息。然後繼續再生六七個禮拜。據說在伊忙碌的時期。平均每禮拜總生三個蛋。若以十七年總計起來、爲數也很可觀了。</p>
<p>失眠的特别療治法</p>
<p>有一個特别的療治失眠的方法。最近爲英國系譜專家包德氏Ｐ·Ｂoyd所發明。他是系譜學會的會員。在若干時期以前。就患失眠症。精神疲倦。十分痛苦。一方面他却開始從事於編纂一五三八年至一八三七年間英倫與威爾士的結婚人名表。以及詳細的說明。他在一百三十九卷中已編成了一百四十萬條。無論那一個人的結婚年月日。只須在五分鐘中。就可調查得明明白白。他須參考的記錄不下數千種。有因年代過久。而不易閱讀的。每天外間的投函。也是絡繹不絶補充添加。不勝其煩。包氏自已一想。這工作如要完成。非一百年不可。就爲了麻煩過甚。頓使他懨懨欲睡。於是他的失眠症從此全愈了。</p>
<h3>南潯尼</h3>
<p>— 阿香</p>
<p>南潯。浙西重鎭地多尼。婉婉嬰嬰。名播大江江南北。個中多韻趣。摭記之。以爲空門艶史之一頁。</p>
<p>上焉者。推斗姆閣位鎭南垂虹橋畔。此中人眣胅麗穉年。艶傳一里。昔年新舞台。嘗編劇張之。曰斗姆閣。倩人秘密來潯。啗閣主重金率衆赴滬。顯色相於紅氍毹上。現身說法。何如春光洩漏。爲大力者所阻。卒不果。</p>
<p>事有與玉蜻蜓彷彿者。聞客籍某民。偶涉西境小菴。天台錯入。樂煞羣雌。於貝葉紅魚裏。參歡喜禪。某非金剛不壞身。不一月。訪申桂生於地下矣。哀感頑艷。至今猶資爲談助也、</p>
<p>潯尼多蓄髮、墮馬迎春。髻鬏新樣。有若人家人。民十六。有老靑年某。憤若輩之不尼不俗。垢汚遺羞也。集同志若干輩。磨礪以須。擬逐爲薙光。使各個頭上。都成牛山濯濯。以别在家。一般人聞訊。咸不欲以靑絲之髮。犧牲於并州快剪。一時鶯飛蝶亂。紅杏出牆、原有護法者。則皈依　下。不然者。亦逃禪下山。學倌人之從良以去。坐是因緣。南潯尼稍稍替矣。前讀本刋持佛君一文謂南潯尼多妙齡而美麗。可以侑酒。可以銷魂云者。爲三五年前事。今則觀閣猶是。人事已非。開門應客者。率皆雞皮鶴髮者流。劉郎再度。當不勝今昔之感焉。</p>
<h3>有聲電影之新用途</h3>
<p>— 更新</p>
<p>自有聲電影盛行以來。對於劇中人物。不僅繪影。抑且繪聲。吾人處身戲院。誠不啻與影中人晤言一室也。近聞美國伊利諾斯州高等法院。有利用有聲電影以審理訟案之說。已提交該地律師公會加以考慮。據芝加哥某法律學校校長李氏宣稱。法院當利用現代科學之新貢獻。以求其職務執行上之完備。用有聲電影審理訟案。可以保留兩造及證人之聲音容貌與其口供時之態度動作。絲毫無遺。較之僅用印刷或文字的筆錄。自然更易達到公平之鵠的云。</p>
<h3>壽宴繽紛錄</h3>
<p>— 朱爵</p>
<p>蜀中名畫家張善孖五十生辰。在陶樂春宴客。到上海新聞界文學藝術家都百數十人。極文酒冠裳之樂。不才躬逢其盛。就所聞見。拉雜記此。雖云明日黄花。聊拾天涯芳草。</p>
<p>▲曾農冉畫松　壁間壽畫甚多。如王一亭之善孖造像。謝公展之四季花。賀天健之墨筆山水。馬萬里之松。葉渭莘張聿光汪仲山高尚之等七人合作之松鶴中堂。吳一峯靑綠山水。熊松泉松猴。蔡逸民朱竹。皆一時之選。而又以曾農老墨松爲尤奇巧。農老此畫。係乙丑年作。寥寥矮松。極偃蹇踞傲之致。題爲張大風運腕如雲霄振羽。逼肖老冉。一笑。乙丑五月。酷熱不能安枕。夜起作此。農老下世。此畫爲其家人珍藏。此次曾夫人特檢贈善孖。爲門人致松柏之頌。善孖稱大風堂。而題中有張大風。善孖生日爲五月。而是畫亦五月作。若與張氏有夙緣。師門風義。翰黑因緣。洵爲至寳也。</p>
<p>▲分贈畫扇　席間分贈紈扇。以爲紀念。扇一面係影印善孖畫虎、而由大千補草竹設色。一面則爲善孖四介弟文修先生手晝善孖五十自述詩兩章。書法黑女。秀雋異常。遂與詩畫。合成二絶。令坐客出入懷袖。奉裼大風。其樂無藝耳。</p>
<p>▲和詩之佳　善孖自述兩詩。席次和章甚多。琳　滿壁。尤以魏弱叟步韻。及王夢公步韻集句爲佳。魏詩曰。同是天涯客。厲棲到海濱。忘形無爾汝。憂道見淸貧。黑白鬚眉肖。丹靑體格醇。岑苔今契合。久敬最相親。虎虎熊熊氣。蒼茫萬壑間。妙於淸史處。現出宰官閒。畫荻承瑤室。扶桑挾島山。一篇松柏頌。我聖未能删。王詩曰滄海横流日。移家近海濱。朋儕多式好。談笑可療貧。君擅詩中畫。我慚學未醇。躋堂今介壽。綵服正恬親。腹有千秋業。悠然天地間。才高惟遠俗。志大豈能間。儀廙同名世。鱸尊思買山。著書娛歲月。壽世莫輕删。王係集句。而一氣呵成。天衣無縫。古人所謂文章本天成。妙手偶得之也。</p>
<h3>游韓漫談（十）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>漢城盤桓一星期之後。轉往韓國故都今爲半島上第二商埠的平壤。（按卽此次日韓浪民排華暴動最劇烈僑胞死傷最慘酷之處）同行者十二人。爲載譽而來的兩江東征女子籃球隊。想不到在車站上歡迎的僑胞。有二千餘人之衆。他們各執靑天白日滿地紅的國旗。高呼三聲「大中華民國萬歲。」對我們表示這樣熱烈至誠的情緒。眞是「受寵若驚」。而且其中除僑商以外。都是短衫赤足。身强力壯的農工們。神彩非常和悅。怪不得日本人朝鮮人也成羣結隊來看我們中國人空前未有的盛舉。晚上。他們又集合在中華樓開歡迎會。據說這是在韓僑衆與國内運動界第一次見面。他們希望常有競技團體到朝鮮來。替他們增光。更希望有我國的飛機·軍艦來宣慰僑衆。替中國人爭一口氣。他們報告在韓所受的痛苦。一字一滬。對於祖國統一·發奮圖强。是一致的要求與熱望。勞動階級都能自身覺悟。確是一種很好的現象。</p>
<p>平壤是中日甲午戰塲。有很多遺跡。如玄武門·牡丹台·最勝台·乙密台·及歷史上極可紀念的箕子陵。憑弔之餘。發人猛省。大有「不堪回首話當年」的悲感。甲午之役。吾軍據守大同江以西。日軍集中於大同江之東。兩軍對抗。淸軍總領佐寳貴。困守玄武門。日將原田重吉。率十六名精兵。午夜來襲。破吾陣地。於是全軍紛向安東方面敗退。平壤旣失。吾軍在韓根據地。全被敵軍掠奪而去。牡丹台在山之巓。吾軍所築堅固砲壘。遺跡尚存。最勝台原名五勝台。在日本併吞朝鮮後。才改名。表示他們戰勝的光榮。台前數步。立一木牌。繪戰爭形勢圖。註明我軍第一至第五堡壘。及日軍朝寗支隊·元山支隊偷襲我軍的路線。乙密台原爲吾軍將領馬玉崐所扼守。因玄武門攻破而敗退。附近古樹參天。看那樹上密如蜂房的子彈洞。可以想見三十六年前兩軍戰事的劇烈。各種碑·額。都由中文而一律改爲日文。顯揚他們的光耀。揭示我國的恥辱。有心人看了愈覺慘淡而心傷。箕子陵就是周封箕子入韓。後來莽身於此。追念三千年前箕子的功勳。將如何安慰箕子的英魂。在此可以證明中韓在歷史上關係的久遠與深切。而今任彼矮奴猖狂。我們浮游於大同江上。才能聽得一　「亡國之恨」、</p>
<p>總之。日本謀我的野心。是朝野上下一致的行動。我四萬萬同胞。亦當知所醒悟。對於此次朝鮮排華的慘案。我們始終認定韓人是被動的。不是我們交涉的對手。而於日本預定的隂謀。萬不可恕。我們誓作政府後盾。嚴重交涉。最低的要求。（一）嚴辦日韓浪民暴動的禍首。（二）賠償華僑全部損失。（三）撫恤死難華僑及傷者。（四）日本政府向我國政府書面道歉。（五）保證以後决不再發生同樣事件。在交涉未達到目的以前。全國一致以沉毅勇猛的精神。永遠對日經濟絶交。這種有效力的抵制。我相信能堅持到半年以上。日本一定會軟化的。</p>
<p>末後敬向讀者聲明的。這一篇稿原來是拙作「東游鱗爪」中的一部份。拉雜寫來。先在此發表。其動機完全爲朝鮮事件激於義憤而發。謬誤之處。還祈讀者原諒。（完）</p>

<h3>？？？（二七）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良依着伊所指的地方看去，見衣架上一件白洋紗長衫，忙拉着袖子問伊：</p>
<p>「是這個麽？」</p>
<p>「是啊！你别去惹他，我嚇極了。」</p>
<p>伊說時，兩手對眼睛上一遮，不敢看了。子良忙把長衫取下，對衣櫥裏一抛。</p>
<p>「你看！鬼被我驅逐掉了！」</p>
<p>夫人取去雙手一看，依然驚呌着：</p>
<p>「還有一個大腦袋！」</p>
<p>「胡閙！這是我的草帽！」</p>
<p>說着，把草帽取下，要拿過去給伊看，伊又嚇得不敢看，子良用指在帽頂上彈彈，伊聽了聲音，方始相信，敢對草帽細看。</p>
<p>「那白鬼呢？」</p>
<p>「那是一件白長衫！」</p>
<p>夫人聽了，將信將疑，然而子良不敢再取出長衫來，掛到衣架上去給伊看。在伊驚魂未定的當兒，娘姨已經把夫人吃的稀飯和菜，送上來了，伊端了一盤，走到床前，想尋一個放盤的地方。</p>
<p>「我不起來了，把盤放在床沿上！」</p>
<p>娘姨放好了盤，夫人用筷先嘗嘗小菜，娘姨回頭看着子良：</p>
<p>「夜夜開出來了，下樓去吃罷！」</p>
<p>子良剛要下去，對夫人一看。</p>
<p>「去不得！」</p>
<p>子良便立定了。</p>
<p>「你一去，我又要嚇了。」</p>
<p>「我夜飯還没吃咧！」</p>
<p>「你何不陪我一同吃稀飯呢？」</p>

<h3>訓育主任</h3>
<p>— 三木</p>
<p>我校訓育主任西先生、是某大學學生、看起來似乎是有廿五六歲的樣子、臉是黑中透黄、兩眼倦倦欲睡、穿的是一身山芋色的洋裝、我們班裏的黨義是他擔任、每當他到了課室、學生們的精神便都爲之一振、因爲他點過名之後、並不講書、先談靑年煩悶問題、次對自由戀愛漫談一番、再次還對學生們說、「你們有什麽切身問題、不妨個别對我談談、我一定指示你們一條出路、萬不要以爲我是男子、就不好意思講……」</p>
<p>課室中像酒樓般的嘈雜、每個人都互相談論着、</p>
<p>「西先生一定是失戀的、」</p>
<p>「不、他有神經病、你不見他說話總是顚三倒四的、聽說、他的妻子太不時髦、他時常的氣她、所以現在精神上很不完全……」</p>
<p>「他每次對我們發牢騷、都是暗示給阿環（同學之名）的、你不見他的眼睛是偷看她的嗎、……」</p>
<p>時光未免神速、西先生還没講書本、</p>
<p>噹噹的鐘聲、就振盪了各人的心弦、</p>
<p>半年黨義課的時間都是消耗在無味的話談中了、在放暑假的前兩星期、西先生、看到課本只教了五頁、不免着起慌來、上了課、連名都不點、就打開書本、像連珠砲般的讀下去、起碼要讀完十個配雞（Ｐages）、才放下書背講、</p>
<p>「中國年來受帝國主義的壓迫、於是先總理創三民主義之說、以謀打倒帝國主義、」</p>
<p>「帝國主義是用專制的手叚來壓迫弱小民族的、」</p>
<p>「我國民族像一盤散沙、向無團結精神、所以最容易被帝國主義所侵略、我們靑年須要團結起來去打倒帝國主義、同時要想實現三民主義首先也應該打倒帝國主義……」</p>
<p>「啊、你怎樣會睡了、……」西先生正講得起勁、忽感到室中太沉寂、偶一下視、見幾個學生都倦伏在桌上了、</p>
<p>「好、我費這麽大力氣給你們講書、你們都不專心聽着、我也不高興再講了」</p>
<p>「不、先生、你講吧、我們很靜心的聽着呢、」</p>
<p>「先生、你眞太吃苦了、這樣熱的天應該休養一下、反正也要下課了、不用講了、」</p>
<p>「不、這不像話、半年來、這一小本書還没講完、我很對諸位不起、現在我要努力一下、以補救你們的黨義、」西先生說完幾句懺悔詞便又扯起喉嚨來、</p>
<p>「從上面所講、我們可以知道現在國民黨唯一的任務就是去打倒帝國主義、」</p>
<p>「你没帶書可以和旁人共一本看、」西先生一眼又發現了痕的桌上無書、</p>
<p>「不要緊的、先生、你所講的、我心裏全能記得住、書上太簡、没有像你講的這麽許多打倒帝國主義、」</p>
<p>西先生默然、全班哄然、</p>
<p>有一天、天氣熱得很、西先生讀完五頁後、豆大的汗珠、就不由得落下來、他一面將右手伸入褲袋内去掏手帕、一面走到門口去關課室的門、</p>
<p>「先生、什麽道理、這樣熱、還關門、」同學們很驚奇的質問、</p>
<p>「我要脫去外套、恐外人看見不雅、」他說着就脫下來了、</p>
<p>「先生未免自私、爲己之利、害我們大家受熱、」</p>
<p>「你們熱、總比我好些、我的衣服是厚絨的、」</p>
<p>「那先生又何必穿西裝呢、」</p>
<p>「穿西裝有兩樣好處、一來行路、上電車便利、二來容易顯示靑年的精神、」</p>
<p>「穿中山裝不是一樣嗎、」</p>
<p>「是呀，聽說先生還是黨員、更應該穿中山裝了、格外顯出精神、好去打倒帝國主義、」</p>
<p>哈哈哈—附和着一片笑聲、西先生裝聾做啞、</p>
<p>有一次、倪的衣箱内失去五十元、西先生聽了、連忙飛跑到宿舍裏來搜查、</p>
<p>「男先生怎麽也可以搜女生的宿舍、不是有女訓育員嗎、」一個有血氣的同學、看見西先生玩弄的態度有點氣了、</p>
<p>「誰來反對、誰有嫌疑、」</p>
<p>「旣不許反對、就得像正經事、難道小小为粉盒子内也盛得下五十元嗎、」本來西先生太不像事了、看見了女生的每一樣東西都是愛不忍釋手、無怪招惹得人家這樣說他、</p>
<p>上課鈴打了、五十元、也没搜出、只好暫時上課、</p>
<p>「學校發生偷竊的事、是最不幸了、今天這件事、搜了半天也無結果、教務長與校長、一些不肯帮忙、只說憑我處理、我想諸位都是高中學生、人格一定很有修養、當然不會做出此事、所以我想和諸位討論一下、關於這件事的辦法、諸位可有什麽好的方法嗎、」</p>
<p>「我們有什麽好的方法、此事當然歸訓育任一人負責、」反對男先生搜宿舍的同學在報復了、</p>
<p>「這件事總算是學校的事、大家應該共負此責、怎麽你們一些合作的精神都没有、」</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「什麽合作不合作、這都是小事、現在是黨義課、還是請先生教我們怎樣去打倒帝國主義吧」好說的李用滑稽的口吻譏誚、</p>
<p>「你們眞是樂天派、人家有急事、也不肯援手、」西先生失望了、只好書歸正傳、</p>
<p>「資本家强盛到了極點、就形成帝國主義、所以我們反對資本家、也是打倒帝國主義的一種方法、」</p>
<p>「………………………………」</p>
<p>第二天、西先生開全體大會特爲報告失竊事、</p>
<p>「在學校中發生偷竊事、這是很丢面子的、因爲個個都是知識份子、怎麽還能做出這樣事來、不過昨日宿舍中没有搜出來、我想這雖是偷者不該、實在也是失者疏忽、現在有了這一次犧牲、正是給你們一個很好的教訓、此後各自謹愼、如再發生同樣事故、我是不負責的、」</p>
<p>「難道我的錢白失了麽、」倪輕自語着、</p>
<p>「奇怪、昨日他搜女生宿舍爲什麽不搜校役和娘姨、今天說了這麽幾句就算了事了、」</p>
<p>「校役是他乾爹、娘姨是他岳母、……」</p>
<p>「你不要胡說了、」</p>
<p>西先生病了、聽說是害相思病、對方是校中教手工的某先生、</p>
<p>諸君們、關於我校的訓育主任形形色色、想你們都知道了、希望你們也寫出你們的訓育主任來、以資比較、同時也可以知道現在校中的訓育主任們都是什麽的人才、</p>
<h3>化騐室中</h3>
<p>— 李尊權</p>
<p>他拿了一隻鐵盆、放在化騐室的中央地上。傾一些氣酸鉀（Ｐotassium　Chlorate　KA）和糖粉（Ｓaccharum　alta）在内、把來拌攪均匀以後、回到室的一隅、取一瓶濃硫酸（Ｓulphuric　acic　fort）（Ｈ２ＳＯ４）出來、平置在台上、另用一隻滴管、—點眼藥水用的玻璃管—吸了少許的硫酸、向那鐵盆裏滴了幾滴、這樣、氣酸鉀因硫酸的作用、發生强熱、那和氣酸鉀同置的糖粉、便被碳化而生火了、他就用一張廢紙、做個媒介、燃着了那火酒燈、他再拿燈—火酒燈—放在那只置在三脚架上的錁製的水壼下面、不到三分鐘辰光、壼裏的水熱了、他倒了一杯、一面喝着、一面走向窗口去、</p>
<p>用這個法子燒水、—他夜半醒來口喝的當兒、一時找不到火柴、他就這般的燒水、—已不知幾多次了、可是、這一趟、他去憶起了一件往事、這個、也許爲的是、這次用了過量的氣酸鉀、致發響亮的爆發聲的緣故吧、也許是、爲了相同的景色觸感了他的心境嗎、</p>
<p>也是這樣的景色吧、渺茫無際的原野裏的一切、除了幾顆閃閃發光的孤星、和他的那舍化騐室裏還有一線微弱的燈光發射着以外、什麽也没有了、什麽也見不到了、眞的、祇有死般的慘淡和沉寂、</p>
<p>他坐在靠窗口的一隻寫字台的旁邊、兩目注視着放在火酒燈上的鉗鍋裏的彈性樹膠（Ｓutta　Purcha）和其他的混合物、</p>
<p>因爲在鄉村裏、没有煤氣管的裝置的緣故、自然談不到用本生燈—可以調劑熱量、能生適合所需要的熱力的本生燈—來加熱使在適量的温度、所以他守候着、時刻將火酒燈拿開、防止熱力的過高、</p>
<p>「宗」一個很熟的聲音、從窗外透進來、</p>
<p>「唉、嵐、您怎的這時候會到這裏來、有甚要事、你一個人來的麽、」他向外驚異地望着、半像歡迎、半像拒絶地問她、</p>
<p>「是的、我請你開門吧、」</p>
<p>「唔、」他哼着去開門、</p>
<p>—轟—……拍拍　……—一個爆發炸裂的聲音、接着一陣鞭炮響、滿室發亮、同時濃烟彌漫起來、把個剛跨進門的她、嚇倒在他的身上、有爆發經騐的他、—時常有爆發的事情發生對之不以爲意的他—也有些慌了、愕然的不知如何是好、想往外走嗎、那麽、嵐怎樣呢、他只得保持着鎭靜的態度說、</p>
<p>「嵐……您…不要這樣…讓我去弄滅了那火、……」</p>
<p>「……」她閉着眼睛、索性依臥在他胸前了、</p>
<p>總算徼幸、不幾秒鐘、火自行息了、可是天花板已給烟火熏黑了一大塊、</p>
<p>他看著火息了、心要安了、想推開嵐、但不知道爲了什麽緣、像有些不忍、他扶著她、還是說摟著她吧、向沙發上去、他和她並坐著、他撫慰著她、</p>
<p>「嵐、你看此刻可平靜了、」他看見她閉著眼睛、</p>
<p>「啊、這怎麽的……」她張一張熱涙盈盈的二隻眼、又立刻閉起來了、</p>
<p>「好、…你在嚇我、你爲甚要嚇我、恐嚇我、…這、…樣、於你有益的麽、…您不要我來、儘說明好了、你爲、爲甚要這樣的捉弄我呢、你現在夠了嗎、我没有對不起你的地方、你爲甚要害我、要殺我、你要殺、就這般殺了我吧、我…」她是在哭了、眞的哭了、他起初以爲是那濃烟的作祟、使她流涙、所以他替他輕輕地揩拭、但此刻他明白了、同時這個出於意料之外的一話、說得他也急了、慌了、比方才聽到爆發聲時還要慌了、他忙把她推開、現出莊重的態度、向她辯白、表明他自己是坦然的、是敬愛她的、說明他是爲了過大意的緣故、致藥品爆發、作算他是錯了、也當有原諒的可能、末後、他更這樣的說、「…如果没有你、我必然不會離開那坐位的、至少、我又要受一些損傷了、在身體上的任何一部份、我眞的、不知怎樣的感謝你纔好哩、…」他說了許話、只獲到她幾句不關痛癢的回音、至於她的心裏如何、相信他的話嗎、有意撒嬌嗎、</p>
<p>連他自己也不知道、—直至現在、還是一樣的不知道、</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>聯軍苦戰四年、已是力竭聲嘶、更加這些精神方面的打擊、軍心不振、戰鬥力自然趨於薄弱、幸而我們旗幟下的士卒、準備犧牲以挽頽勢、克萊孟沙和勞合喬治居於兩國政府首領的地位、用其優美的毅力襄助戰事、威爾遜總統久久始加入戰團、現今切望以美國雄原的實力、一心一意的助戰、最高司令的責任在於施用積積方法、縮短危局、注意弱點、避免混亂、以及從速挽回局勢、</p>
<p>其時、六月五日、我爲預防敵人在孟鐵第歐及諾昂間進攻、便從此面支隊抽調一師（第十四師、）交貝當司令支配。我請海格總指揮研究英軍更替這支隊的另一師的問題、</p>
<p>我佈置各種預防、以免聯軍只有招架而無回手的弊病、一面把改編的法軍各師以及從英軍方面開到的美軍調往勞倫及伏斯奇方面、另調法軍若干開入英綫、以備必要時抵禦德軍的進攻、這在沙姆河阿拉斯朗斯一帶隨時可以發生的、一面研究沙姆河之北及法國第五軍前綫採取攻勢、以便疴亞斯河取守勢戰的時候牽制敵人的兵力、</p>
<p>末了、在卽將開始决戰的時候、我寫信給法軍總司令、呌他不要忘記了依據作戰計劃、進取戰略上的結果、司令官的種種責任、以及應當輸入全體參戰官兵的精神、</p>
<p>六月九日、夜半開始的砲戰之後、霍特勒司令的步兵、上午三點四十五分、達到我軍愛洋谷與體斯谷間的防綫、上午六時、敵軍的攻擊擴展到疴亞斯河、</p>
<p>德軍在戰綫分配不甚平均、兩翼兵力散開、中路兵力結集在洛樂與體斯谷之間、擔任進攻、有九師至十三師、</p>
<p>聯軍卽在中路崩潰了、法軍第五十八及第百二十五師、一經接觸卽行不支而退、上午七時許、被敵逐過古里、上午</p>
<p>十時、敵軍攻入勒松梅慈、上午十一時、我軍第二綫、自瑪琍以至麥魯意拉莫斯、長七哩半、盡被敵人佔領、聖克樂特高原和體斯谷森林、也相繼陷入敵人掌握、</p>
<p>法國後備隊六師之衆參加戰事、幸卽於午後把敵人的進攻挫折、向晚、敵軍便在瑪琍、白樂、馬格里斯、凡特立谷綫停頓了、</p>
<p>簡單的話、霍特勒司令的攻擊、除了右翼没有多大進展、其餘各路確已突進了法軍防綫、孔碑直接發生了動搖、</p>
<p>但我相信後備軍團的實力仍足以應付這形勢、况且巴伐里亞太子的親兵並未加入六月九日的戰事、我遂决定不去調動海格的兵力、然而爲着預防起見、我請他在十日晨把第二十二軍團南面一師調往康梯近郊、再以另一師在沙姆河之南塡防、這便可使貝當司令調用第一軍後方的全部法國後備隊、</p>
<p>十日、敵軍繼續進攻、但没有像前天的那樣順利、敵人雖則加添一師生力兵助戰、他不過在梅藝西面稍爲得手、他唯一重要的進展是在梅慈之東、那面法軍第五十三師的退却、遂使直達列培谷的門戸洞開、德軍因得在疴亞斯河右岸孟馬克與什必尼之間立脚、然而德軍這方面勢力的伸展、便威脅疴亞斯河左岸的法軍（第三十八軍團）撤退至巴意里特拉西和普什林、卽一九一四年的舊防綫</p>
<p>雖有這方面的失利、然而十日的結果、大體上尚屬差强人意、「敵人的前進不能像三月以來幾次進攻的順利、我軍以步步爲營的戰術、正在固守防地、援軍開到也能調用得宜一、法軍防禦工程、根據最近計劃、佈置得旣深且固、遂使敵軍劇烈的砲火掩護下的突然猛攻、沮喪而止、</p>
<p>福悅司令現正準備以五師生力兵、四師在第一綫、乘機向敵軍兩翼大舉反攻、</p>
<p>一九一八年春、德軍第三次進攻之後、我的重要的責任就是根據新近幾役的教訓、鞏固現在的局勢、以及計劃聯軍將來的作戰、</p>
<p>我們對於過去的幾次戰事雖則感到極大的興趣、現今局勢的迫切須要應當首先給以注意、敵人顯見得不會以梅慈方面的挫折而甘心罷休、敵軍仍有實力雄軍的後備隊、據說、六月十五日有五十四師、六月二十日六十一師、六月三十日七十五師、其間五十五師係生力軍云、</p>
<p>敵軍已在沙姆河、法蘭特、香本、以及疴亞斯河方面、得着很順利的進展、我軍受了重大損失、敵人似有利用優越的兵力、乘勝進取的必要、一方面、他一定知道美國不久必以其猛不可當的兵力參加戰事、另一方面、他一定感覺到英法兩軍所早已經歷過的危局、快要臨近他自身了、（註·一九一八年六月裏、德軍最高司令已經不得不調用一九一九年級的兵士、一九二○年級的新兵、五月裏已編成一部、七月裏便可開到前綫）、</p>
<p>所以敵軍不久想來要採取新攻勢、但在什麽地方進攻呢、固然相信他要向英綫進攻、我們但也不能不顧慮到大隊敵軍可向任何一叚的法綫出動、我因此决定聯軍後備隊應當準備着、要從北海以至伏斯奇河、隨時隨地開入前綫、援助英軍或法軍作戰、英法兩軍、同時必須完全準備迎敵、（未完）</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Legal Rights Negotiations</h3>
<p>Japan Proposes Various Opinions</p>
<p>Our Side Has Already Delivered a Response</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sino-Japanese legal rights negotiations, our side has already had a response delivered to Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is rumored that the Japanese government's proposal, which was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Shigemitsu last month, put forward the following opinions: 1. To exclude special areas (referring to Manchuria and Mongolia); 2. To request the establishment of special courts in each treaty port, with Japanese judges participating; 3. To request that the Chinese interior be completely open. After our side studied the case, we concluded that Japan is a country whose treaty has expired, which is different from the situation of other countries. The Japanese government is willing to negotiate the legal rights portion of the new Sino-Japanese trade agreement first, and once there are results, they will be incorporated into the newly signed Sino-Japanese trade agreement in the future. Our side believes that this opinion can be accommodated, and we initially agreed to their request. However, regarding the Japanese side's intention to make special areas an exception, it seems that they intend to extend the period for Japanese residents within those areas, such as Manchuria and Mongolia, or along the South Manchurian Railway, for a certain number of years, temporarily exempting them from Chinese legal jurisdiction. However, our country, in recovering legal rights, has a comprehensive plan and will not allow any part to be reserved. Also, regarding the establishment of special courts in various treaty ports, appointing foreign judges as consultants or advisors for the judges to consult, this should also be determined by our side. The Japanese proposal's wording of "Japanese judges participating" leaves room for interpretation and should not be stipulated so broadly. Furthermore, regarding the complete opening of the Chinese interior, this matter is closely related to allowing Japanese residents to reside freely in China. This right can only be permitted when the concession issue and the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in China are resolved. All of the above points were fully stated in our country's response to the Japanese government. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Communist Bandit Forces in Jiangxi Are Collapsing</h3>
<p>Xingguo and Ningdu Under Siege</p>
<p>The Kangdu Peng Bandit Gang Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>Bandits Fleeing to Chadong and Northern Fujian</p>
<p>(Nanchang) An airplane report indicates that the right-wing is besieging the city of Xingguo. The sound of artillery is deafening, and the sound of machine guns and rifles is like a string. The artillery battle is extremely fierce. The left-wing has surrounded Ningdu in multiple layers, with the first line fiercely attacking the county seat. Successive reinforcements are arriving continuously. The bandits are using this as a base and are closing the city and defending it to the death. The plane dropped two 160-pound bombs, killing a large number of bandits. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) After our army captured Guangshi, the bandits retreated and gathered in Ruijin, Ningdu, Donggu, and Changting. Our left-wing bypassed the south of Ningdu, and the right-wing went out of Ningxi. The Ningdu bandits are like fish in a net. There were fierce battles in Qikeng, Chenggang, Longgang, and Tantou near Donggu. The bandit leaders all fled Donggu first. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chiang Kai-shek is summoning the chairmen of the various district branch committees today to give instructions on the strategy for working in the bandit areas. (19th Dispatch)</p>

Chiang Kai-shek, considering that the porters were all farmers, provided funds for them to return to their hometowns. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain German instructor returned from Jiangxi and said that the Jiangxi bandits had disintegrated since the 12th. All the left-wing Central Army has completely advanced to the vicinity of Shicheng and Ningdu. The right-wing Central Army has been pressing in from the vicinity of Jishui. Airplane reports state that the enemy is fleeing towards northern Fujian, and places such as Luokou, Zhaoxiyan, Juanxi, and Shangqi, which used to be strongholds for the bandits, are now being recovered by the Central Army one after another. With Futian already captured, Donggu will naturally be recovered as well. It is also reported that there are still many Red bandits in the Huichang and Ruijin areas. It seems that Zhu De and Mao Zedong's full force is in that area, but the two Fujian divisions in that area are on the Tingzhou border and are expected to echo with the punitive expeditionary forces soon. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: The entire Peng bandit gang in Kangdu was solved on the 18th. From Jianning, they harassed the flanks of the 6th Route Army. After fierce fighting with the Mao and Xu divisions for a whole day and night, the Zhao department launched a surprise attack from the side, completely eliminating the Peng bandit gang. Chiang Ting-wen's army launched a fierce artillery attack on Xin'an Shangping from Yiqian on the 18th and occupied it immediately. (19th Dispatch)</p>

The Red bandits are entrenched in the Hulingzui area and are still attempting to resist. It is expected that they will be occupied within a few days. This time, in the suppression of the Red bandits, it is planned to attack Ningdu in coordination after the right-wing army reaches a suitable location, with the aim of annihilating them in one fell swoop. Currently, Zhu Shaoliang, Commander-in-Chief of the left-wing army corps, is stationed in a certain place more than ten miles away from Guangchang, commanding the clearing of the remaining bandits in various places. He will enter Guangchang within a few days. The right-wing army has established contact with the Central Army corps after capturing Donggu on the 16th. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Planning for New Treasury Bond Guarantee Fund</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance is drafting new regulations for a certain treasury bond issue of tens of millions. Because the Cantonese customs revenue of 1.2 million per month is still in dispute, the originally planned guarantee amount will be slightly reduced, so it is necessary to reduce the issue amount. Also, the Anglo-French debt of 1894 has been fully repaid this year. This fund from customs duties will be stored as before. It was originally intended to be used as a reserve fund for the gold standard, but now someone has suggested that it be used as a treasury bond guarantee to ease the financial situation. As for the cash that the Ministry of Finance transported to the United States for storage in the past two years, it is something that the country should do.

<h3>Dispute Over Resignation of Executive Committee Members of the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>

Because it was unable to retain the resigning members, the Chamber decided to fill the vacancies with alternates and reported it to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for record-keeping. Bureau Chief Li Jiecai believes that the Chamber's organization is no longer sound and has not yet approved it. He also wants to retain the positions of Su and other Executive Committee members through mediation. Many misunderstandings have arisen between the two sides. When Director Li recently spoke with the Executive Committee members currently serving in the Chamber, such as Pu Yangshan, Mu Huaxuan, and Ma Jun, their opinions differed greatly due to their legal positions, and conflicts in language were unavoidable, resulting in a very stiff situation. Currently, the Chamber is holding Executive and Supervisory Committee meetings day after day and has decided to disobey Li's measures. Their attitude is very agitated, and they have decided to appeal to higher-level organizations, which will inevitably cause a dispute. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Urges Allocation of Funds for Embassies and Consulates</h3>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Research on Japan (II)</h3>
<p>Regarding the importance of studying the Japanese question, there are indeed many insightful and incisive arguments from domestic scholars. However, speakers are earnest, and listeners are indifferent. In this regard, Chinese people always feel that it is insignificant. Compared to Japan's research on us, the government advocates from above, and the people work hard from below. Many scholars and experts are doing their best, fearing to fall behind. The difference is truly immeasurable. Mr. Jiang Menglin also made a poignant remark on the attitude of Chinese people towards Japan, saying, "In the past forty years, our country's attitude towards Japan has changed three times. Before the Sino-Japanese War, it was contempt; after the Sino-Japanese War, it was emulation; since the Twenty-One Demands, it has been hatred. Contempt led to the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War. Emulation led to the Reform Movement. Extreme hatred turns back to contempt. In terms of modern academics, Japan is not as good as Europe and the United States. But its ability to absorb the strengths of others and blend them with the customs of its own nation is also a characteristic. How can we despise it? Therefore, we should study Japan deeply. The reason is not only to know ourselves and our enemy. Shortsighted people have not heard of the rapid progress of Japanese academics in recent years, and when they talk about Japan, they often express contempt. It seems not worth studying. Alas, have we forgotten the lesson of the Sino-Japanese War?" These words are poignant and thought-provoking. Japan was established in the islands and was initially a completely bare and uncultured nation. Only after the introduction of our country's culture did it have culture to speak of. This is an undeniable fact. However, after the Meiji Restoration, it worked hard to govern and vigorously reformed, taking the spiritual civilization of the East and the material civilization of the West, merging and integrating them to adapt them to its own life and use. At the same time, its people were united and diligent, working for the country and the nation tirelessly. This kind of upward national spirit has driven its country to become increasingly prosperous. Japan after the Meiji Restoration is no longer the Japan that Ono Imoko, dispatched to our country to import civilization six or seven years ago. Our country, being ignorant of the situation in Japan and treating people as barbarians, was arrogant. In the Sino-Japanese War, Japan, knowing that we were unprepared, was even more prepared. We knew nothing about it. Not to mention its outward development plans, diplomatic policies, and national secrets, we were ignorant of its military preparations at the time. People had already decided to fight, but we still repeatedly called for peace. Our contempt and ignorance of others were such that defeat was inevitable. This is how the country's contempt for Japan led to defeat in the Sino-Japanese War. After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese people were shocked by the power of a new and emerging nation nearby. Those who had despised it now emulated it. So they sent people to investigate and sent people to study abroad. All of the country's industries and military preparations hired Japanese consultants for guidance. They worked hard to imitate the Japanese, almost taking this as the great way to revitalize the country. This trend led to the Reform Movement during the Qing Dynasty of Guangxu. This cannot be said to be a good phenomenon of emulation. However, they emulated its superficial aspects but ignored its essence. They studied its outer form but ignored its inner secrets. They envied Japan, but they cannot be said to have understood Japan. Moreover, most of the students sent to Japan at that time studied military affairs and crash courses in politics and law. After returning to the country, there were many who could stand out and take it as their own responsibility to save the country. However, there were also many who studied military affairs and crash courses in politics and law and then became warlords and politicians after returning to the country, poisoning our country and society and becoming the main actors in the political turmoil of our country in the past two or three decades. This is the result of emulation. In the fourth year of the Republic, Japan made unreasonable Twenty-One Demands on us. The Chinese people were extremely angry and turned to hatred. They called for national salvation and revenge in unison and appealed to justice and reason, seeking help from the great powers and calling for help from the China Association. However, they never paid attention to how to probe Japanese conspiracies, how to understand Japanese strength, and how to study Japanese weaknesses. Some even became so hostile to Japan that they did not want to see Japanese people, did not want to learn Japanese, and did not want to hear anything about Japanese politics or have any contact with Japan. The more they hated Japan, the deeper the estrangement. Therefore, after the fourth year of the Republic, the Chinese people spoke of resisting Japan every day, but internal conflicts and disasters arose one after another, and Japan's encroachment on and humiliation of us became more and more rampant. This is the result of hatred. In summary, contempt for Japan, emulation of Japan, and hatred of Japan are not enough to defend ourselves or resist insults. The only way to seek self-defense and resist insults is to understand Japan. It goes without saying that diplomats should know Japan. Even the general public in the country, and even young students, should have a considerable amount of common knowledge about Japan. Only by knowing the other person can we defend ourselves. Only then can we thwart the arrogance and ambitions of the Japanese. In recent years, the Japanese have been afraid of the increasing national power of the Soviet Union and have gradually become its powerful neighbor and enemy. In order to prepare in advance, they have studied the Soviet Union, such as organizing academic societies, publishing monthly magazines, and compiling series of books, working tirelessly to understand the other party in order to compete in the future battlefield. Their far-sightedness and deep insights are truly something that should alert our people.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Telegram from the National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry to all newspaper offices, forwarded to all levels of party headquarters, all agencies, and all organizations nationwide for your attention: This time, the Japanese imperialists, under the pretext of the Wanpaoshan Incident, dispatched troops and police in an attempt to create another May 3rd Massacre to realize their aggression. They are still harboring evil intentions, becoming more and more unscrupulous, instigating Koreans to massacre overseas Chinese, abandoning public reason, and violating humanity. All those with blood in their veins are filled with indignation. We, based on our position of promoting national products and supporting revolutionary diplomacy, believe that to fatally subdue the Japanese imperialists, it is not in a moment of excitement, but in permanent perseverance. Therefore, for economic severance of relations, we must first devote ourselves to production. To seek increased production, we must promote national products. Promoting national products is an economic national defense movement, and striving for production is a key plan for national salvation. We hope that compatriots across the country will abide by this intention, act as defenders, and express their grievances. We hope you will take note.

<h3>Telegram from Kaifeng</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices for your attention: Henan is unfortunate, with famines occurring frequently for years. Military affairs have just been settled, and natural disasters have struck again. In eastern Henan, such as Luyi; in northern Henan, such as Mengxian and Jiyuan; and in western Henan, such as Dengfeng, Songxian, Yanshi, Lushi, and Mianchi counties, huge hailstones have caused disaster, destroying all crops in the fields, with corpses everywhere, and cries shaking the heavens. We are planning ways to provide relief to save these people from disaster, but in eastern Henan, such as Yancheng, Xihua, Linying, and Xiangcheng; and in southern Henan, such as Dengxian, Zhengyang, Xichuan, Yexian, Xiping, Huangchuan, Xixian, Shangcheng, Xinyang, and Luoshan, there have been torrential rains for weeks, causing floods. The water is raging, bringing wind and rain together, with houses collapsing and being swept away by the waves. Fields and homes are flooded, and people and animals are adrift. Fathers and sons are separated, and husbands and wives are scattered. The dead are buried in the bellies of fish, and the living are crying out with exhaustion. Now, the Huai River is overflowing, and only three versions of the city are left in dozens of towns. The Sha River has burst its banks, and there is a lack of grain harvest in hundreds of miles. Some people are trapped in the mud and cannot reach the shore, and others cling to the treetops, hoping for rescue but no boat arrives. It is pitiful that they are saved today, but their homes are destroyed. How can they plan for clothing and food when they are out of danger in the future? This is truly an unprecedented disaster and extreme pain in this moment. Fang is in charge of civil administration and dares not embrace peace. My heart is apprehensive and deeply worried. Now, I sincerely call for help and shed tears to seek assistance. I hope that compatriots who are sinking and dying will embody the virtues of heaven and earth, deliver relief grain early, universally save the people from disaster, generously donate money, and jointly achieve good deeds. The telegram is filled with urgency and panic. Zhang Fang kowtows.</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Red Peril and China's Survival (Continued)</h3>
<p>Yang Xingfo</p>
<p>The Red Army's organization takes the pseudo-Chinese Soviet Republic's Central Revolutionary Military Commission as its highest command organ. Under the Military Commission, there are two offices, the Yangtze Military Commission and the Southern Military Commission, as well as six regional military commissions in Hubei-Henan-Anhui, Hunan-Hubei border, Jiangxi-Northeast, Guangxi Right River, Fujian-Guangdong-Jiangxi, and Hainan Island. The actual strength of its troops varies greatly according to various investigations. According to the investigation in the autumn of last year, there were a total of fourteen armies, with about 70,000 soldiers and about 50,000 rifles. According to Gao Zhanjun's estimate in the "Overview of the Communist Disaster in Jiangxi" in March of this year, the Red Army has at least 80,000 guns and 200,000 people (see the Semi-Monthly Communist Production Journal). According to the "Current Work Plan for the Soviet Region" seized this spring, it has been reorganized into seven armies.</p>
<p>Under the seven armies, there are a total of sixteen divisions and five independent regiments. In addition, there are two guard divisions directly under the command and the Qiongya Independent Division, totaling nineteen divisions and five independent regiments (based on Minister He Yingqin's report to the National Assembly on the inside story of the Red Bandits in Jiangxi). In addition to the guns obtained and the number of people increased this year due to the defeats of the government army, the recent Red Army soldiers are estimated to be around 300,000, with about 120,000 guns. Although the Communist Party claims to take the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army as the backbone force in the Communist Party's war, in the "Current Work Plan for the Soviet Region," regarding the composition of the Red Army, it is said that "the composition of the Red Army is mostly not composed of hired peasants, poor peasants, and coolies as the basic troops. Even the most powerful Fourth and Fifth Armies are still composed of soldiers as the backbone, and the workers' armies are more composed of bandits and hooligans. Most of the main cadres of the Red Army are not workers." Therefore, the so-called Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is only an ideal term. The political commissar of each army is the backbone of an army and has the power to supervise military commanders, which is the Soviet system of the party governing the army. In addition to the Red Army, there is also the Red Guard. All men and women in the bandit area between the ages of eighteen and forty-five who do not exploit the labor of others are obliged to serve as Red Guards. Those in towns are the Red Police Guards, divided into standing and reserve types. The standing teams are separated from production and are solely responsible for defending the locality. The reserve teams are not separated from production, but must receive regular armed training. Those in the countryside are the peasant Red Guards, who are not separated from production, but their organization and training are all prepared to be mobilized at any time. The spear teams are part of the Red Guards. Between the Red Army and the Red Guards, there are guerrillas as the Red Army's reserve army. In addition, there are children's teams, or labor children's groups, organized by children aged ten to fifteen, who are responsible for inspecting pedestrians. There are Young Pioneers, organized by young people aged sixteen to eighteen. The task of killing and charging is often assigned to the Young Pioneers. Regarding military education, it is heard that in Jiangxi, there are Red Army cadre schools and military political schools. Women participate in the Red Guards and various social organizations and have the same status as men, with no independent organization. However, the so-called comfort teams and laundry teams are exclusively for women. Young and middle-aged women mostly serve as comfort team members, and older women serve as laundry team members.</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of guns and bullets, the Red Army often uses cunning tactics in combat: (1) Enticement and encirclement, luring the National Army to mountainous and densely forested areas in the red area for ambushes. (2) Feint to the east and attack the west, pretending to attack a certain place, first going in the other direction, then suddenly turning back to attack the National Army with lightning speed. (3) Avoid the strong and attack the weak, dispersing to avoid strong enemies, and concentrating to encircle weak enemies. (4) Utilizing the masses, using workers and peasants to plant red flags and blow trumpets in the mountains to disrupt the National Army, or using workers and peasants as vanguards to exhaust the National Army's bullets, and then the Red Army would unite to attack fiercely when the National Army was tired. (5) Preserving strength, the Red Army does not engage in attacking fortified positions, does not fight hard battles, does not fight without knowing the enemy's situation, and does not easily fight in areas without Communist Party and bandit-influenced masses. All this is because bullets are too few and difficult to replenish, so they are unwilling to take risks lightly. (6) Shaking the enemy's morale, the Red Army often sends workers, peasants, and women to the National Army to make strong propaganda to shake the morale of the army. The above-mentioned tactics have been tried repeatedly and are mostly familiar to the National Army, so their effectiveness has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's program and mass organizations. Because the Communist Party wants to gain the support of poor peasants to consolidate its regime in the Soviet area, it calls for the thorough implementation of land revolution. Its current ten major programs are: (1) Overthrow imperialist rule; (2) Confiscate the enterprises and banks of foreign capitalists; (3) Unify China and recognize the right to national self-determination; (4) Overthrow the Nationalist government; (5) Establish a government of workers, peasants, and soldiers' representatives (Soviets); (6) Implement an eight-hour working day, increase wages, unemployment relief, and social insurance; (7) Confiscate all the land of the landlord class and return the cultivated land to the peasants; (8) Improve the lives of soldiers and give soldiers land and work; (9) Abolish all taxes from government warlords and local areas and implement a unified progressive tax; (10) Unite the world's proletariat and unite Soviet Russia. Among these ten major programs, only the seventh article, confiscating the land of the landlord class, has indeed been realized. However, what they are doing is a temporary distribution of land, not a real land revolution under communism. The ninth article, abolishing taxes, only abolishes the taxes of the original government offices and replaces them with their new taxes, such as the progressive land tax and the wood and public welfare fees. It is not enough to replace them with fines (specifying local tyrants, landlords, and rich peasants; those who can be fined more than eighty yuan must be fined) and grain collection (when new grains are first harvested, each household is required to keep a certain amount of grain per person per year, and the rest is registered in a book, and when necessary, the grain committee can take it away at any time) and other methods to raise funds and sufficient food.</p>
<p>Regarding the land revolution, there is also the Chinese Communist Party's eight major programs for the land revolution in 1930, the content of which is: (1) Overthrow the power of local tyrants, landlords, and bureaucratic authorities, disarm the counter-revolutionary forces, disarm the peasants, and establish the power of peasant conferences in rural areas; (2) Confiscate the property and land of the landlord class immediately without compensation. The confiscated land will be handled by the peasant conference and distributed to landless and land-poor peasants for use; (3) The properties of ancestral halls, temples, churches, and other public properties, official wastelands, or ownerless wastelands and sand fields will be handled by the peasant representative conference (Soviet) and distributed to peasants for use; (4) Each province and region will have a portion of land for the (Soviet) government to use for immigration and reclamation and to be distributed to workers, peasants, and soldiers for economic use; (5) Announce that all high-interest loan agreements are invalid; (6) Burn all land deeds of local tyrant governments and other contracts that exploit peasants, including written and oral agreements; (7) Abolish all taxes promulgated by warlords and local government offices, abolish the system of contract taxes and likin, and establish a single progressive agricultural economic tax; (8) The state will help the agricultural economy: A. Undertake land projects; B. Improve and expand water conservancy; C. Prevent natural disasters; D. The state will handle immigration affairs; E. The state will operate agricultural banks and credit cooperatives to handle low-interest loans; F. Unify the currency and unify weights and measures; G. All rivers will be managed and operated by the Soviet government.</p>
<p>Among these eight major programs, those that have been implemented are the confiscation of property and land and the destruction of deeds and the distribution of land. The land distribution procedures are as follows: (1) All public land, temple land, ancestral hall land, and land of large landlords (including semi-landlords, rich peasants, and rented land) will be completely confiscated without conditions. All land deeds and official documents will be burned, and the ridges of the fields will be leveled to completely eliminate the boundaries and evidence of the original landlords. (2) The land in each township will be executed and equally distributed by the township's workers', peasants', and soldiers' conference (Soviet). (3) Distribution will be based on population and labor, and all male and female citizens with the ability to work will have the right to distribute land. (4) Citizens without the ability to work (children under the age of sixteen and the elderly and disabled) will be supported by their families or lodging families, and citizens whose burdens are increased as a result will be given additional land as appropriate. (5) The number of acres to be distributed to each person in each township and the number of additional acres to be added due to increased burdens will be determined by the local Soviet in accordance with local conditions, but the number of additional acres per person cannot exceed one-fourth of the number of acres to be distributed (according to this restriction, the elderly, disabled, and underage children will be effectively reduced their right to survival, and the Soviet has no remedy for this, because these people are of no use to the Red Army, so they do not hesitate to sacrifice them). (6) When the population of one place is too large and there is not enough land to be distributed, a portion of the people can be moved to a neighboring place with fewer people. (7) Families of Red Army soldiers, under the condition that no one can farm, the local Soviet can find someone to farm on their behalf (this is the method of the Communist Party to lure soldiers. The former landlord is now a Red Army soldier, and the former tenant farmer is now a tenant farmer for the Red Army, so the Red Army is actually a new landlord class). (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief Chiang Returns to Nanchang from the Front Line</h3>
<p>▲ Brief Overview of the Itinerary After Leaving Nanchang on the 2nd</p>
<p>▲ After Recapturing Guangchang, He Orders His Car Back to the Province</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Commander-in-Chief Chiang departed for the front line on the 2nd of this month. On the 3rd, he arrived safely in Fuzhou and stayed at the forward headquarters of the Eighth Middle School, where he discussed the left-wing operation plan with He Yingqin and gave instructions. On the 5th, he departed for Nancheng. At that time, the Red Bandits focused on southeastern Jiangxi and the Fujian border, planning to attack Nanfeng and Nancheng with all their strength in order to get out of Fujian and Zhejiang. Therefore, Chiang urgently needed to go there in person to encourage morale. After arriving in Nancheng on the 6th, he summoned the generals and gave instructions. Afterwards, he also went to Lichuan and Nanfeng to inspect and command. However, only senior generals knew about it. On the 11th, he supervised the troops and recaptured Kangdu, a key point on the Fujian border. Then he advanced and captured Guangchang. The main force of the Red Bandits had been scattered. However, Chiang felt that the front line was winning victories, and important matters in the headquarters and the central government needed to be handled urgently. Therefore, on the morning of the 16th, he took a civilian boat from Nancheng back to the province. That night, he arrived in Fuzhou and met with He Yingqin for an hour. He then took a civilian boat downstream. At dawn on the 17th, he arrived at Xiebu, which is about forty or fifty miles from the province (some say Yangjiadu, some say Wanshe). He then went ashore and walked to Liantang Station on the Nan-Zhang Road. He Yaozu, Lu Dipin, and Xiong Shihui, who were in Qingyunpu at the time, received the news and rushed to Liantang to greet him. They then took the same car to Qingyunpu to attend the public funeral of the late Division Commander Hu. At that time, Chiang was wearing a straw hat, a light gray straight silk robe, and black leather shoes. His face was slightly darker than before. At around 9:00 AM, the public funeral ceremony of Division Commander Hu was held, presided over by Chiang. After the ceremony, Chiang and Xiong, He, Lu, and others took separate cars back to the province. Military police were densely deployed from Zhongshan Road in the provincial capital to the station. At around 10:00 AM, Chiang arrived at the headquarters. All the important figures in the province went to pay their respects and report everything. As to whether Chiang will go to the front again, nothing is known yet. (July 17th)</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Refugees Arrives in Qingdao</h3>
<p>▲ Li Zhonggang Also Arrives in Qingdao to Report to Beijing</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The first batch of refugees escaping from Korea arrived in Qingdao on the 15th by the Kyodo Maru from Yantai, totaling 807 people. 165 people were transported to Shijiusuo by the Gyeongheung and Yuseong on the 15th. 574 people took the Taesung merchant ship to Shijiusuo on the 16th to return to their hometowns. The above-mentioned merchant ships were all assigned by the Shipping Association and fulfilled their obligations. The remaining 68 people were all residents along the Jiaoji Railway line. After consultation between the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Railway Bureau, a carriage was attached to the 11th train at 3:00 PM on the 16th to transport them back to their hometowns. The Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to escort the train to take care of them. The second batch of refugees arrived in Qingdao this morning (17th) at 12:00 PM by the Changping Maru and the Gyeonggi Maru, totaling 798 people. The Gyeonggi Maru sailed from Incheon to Qingdao, carrying 357 refugees. These refugees had some property, so after landing, most of them found inns to live in on their own. At noon, they elected dozens of representatives to go to the Municipal Steering Committee to describe the plight of the refugees and said that this riot by Koreans was guided by Japanese police, so the Koreans were fearless and their cruel methods were even worse than the Red Bandits. They were crying while speaking. It was found that most of these refugees were from Shouguang and Changle. Tonight or tomorrow morning, they will take the Jiaoji Railway train back to their original hometowns. The Changping Maru came from Yantai, carrying 441 refugees, all of whom lived by farming or doing hard labor in Korea. Women and children accounted for half of them. They were supporting the old and carrying the young, which was very pitiful. After landing, they were led by members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and temporarily accommodated in the New Stage. They were also provided with steamed buns, pot cakes, and boiled water for the refugees to eat. Representatives from all walks of life went to express their condolences, one after another. It is heard that the Shipping Association has assigned three merchant ships to transport more than 200 people to Shijiusuo for landing at 6:00 PM today, so that they can return to their hometowns. Another carriage was borrowed from the Jiaoji Railway and attached to the first train tonight to send about 70 people scattered along the Jiaoji Railway line back to their hometowns. The rest will temporarily stay in the New Stage and be transported tomorrow when there are ships available. It is heard that there will be a third batch of refugees arriving in Qingdao tomorrow. In addition, Li Zhonggang, the head of the Consulate General in Korea, also came to Qingdao on the Gyeonggi Maru on the same day. Li also brought a report detailing the beginning and end of the Korean riot. It is heard that Li will take a ship to Shanghai and then to Beijing to report everything to the central government.

<h3>Refugees Arrive in Jinan via Yantai</h3>
<p>▲ A Total of Forty-One People</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the case of Koreans massacring our overseas Chinese occurred, the overseas Chinese in Korea fled back to China one after another. Everywhere they passed, they were entertained by various chambers of commerce. At 3:19 PM today (17th), refugees from Incheon, Zhao Xushan, Liu Zhenbiao, and others, and refugees from Pyongyang, Liu Jingyuan, Li Jingshen, and others, arrived in Jinan by the 13th train of the Jiaoji Railway. Most of them looked like workers and were in a state of desperation. After getting off the train, they were treated to lunch by the Relief Association and then sent to the Henan Guild Hall on Guanyi Street by the Public Security Bureau's Second Branch, where everything was taken care of by the Xixiang Branch. According to refugees from Incheon, they boarded a ship on the 7th and went to Yantai, and arrived in Weixian by car on the 11th. They boarded the train from Wei early today (17th). According to refugees from Pyongyang, they boarded a ship from Nampo on the 11th, passed through Yantai, and transferred to Qingdao, arriving in Jinan today. This time, Koreans massacred overseas Chinese after the Japanese gave them a five-day deadline to kill at will. Koreans marched in flag-waving formations, blowing horns and drums. Some used bamboo poles more than ten feet long, sharpened into spears, some held sticks, some held stones, and some had large carts in the back, loaded with large quantities of stones to use as weapons. The clothing, money, and furniture of the overseas Chinese were looted by Koreans, and the rest were destroyed. The Japanese, although stating that they would protect our overseas Chinese after the incident, secretly helped the Koreans. The overseas Chinese, believing that the Japanese were protecting them, would not be in danger again, so they took off their clothes and went to bed peacefully. Unexpectedly, they fell into the Japanese trap. At night, Koreans broke into houses and massacred almost all the Chinese. In Incheon and Pyongyang alone, no more than one or two percent of the overseas Chinese managed to escape alive. The reason why we were able to escape alive was thanks to the green gauze tents, which served as a guarantee. The Japanese still used their cunning tricks, destroying their houses and injuring their horses, claiming to the overseas Chinese that the Korean riots had nothing to do with Japan, etc., making false efforts and it is regrettable. It was also found that the refugees who came to Jinan this time had been in Korea for eight or nine years, and some for one or two years. Their jobs included working in factories, farming, and doing business. Most of them were from Jining, Boping, Changqing, and other counties. This time, there were 24 people from Incheon, 17 people from Pyongyang, a total of 41 people, including four women and seven children. (17th)</p>
<h3>Documents Regarding the Wanbaoshan Incident Negotiations Between China and Japan (5)</h3>
<p>▲Letter from the Municipal Affairs Office to the Japanese Consul: Respectfully, regarding the case of Korean people at Wanbaoshan forcefully excavating civilian land to dig waterways and compelling the diversion of the Yitong River, multiple letters have been received previously, stating that investigations were being carried out and the resolution plan agreed upon on June 8th was being implemented, with the withdrawal of police and cessation of work. The issue of the remaining Korean people's departure or stay, and the matter of damage compensation between the parties involved, were previously discussed in our letter to your office on June 17th for your opinion, so as to resolve them as soon as possible. However, today we received an official document from the Changchun County Government, stating that on the 17th of this month, Wang Zhongfu, Meng Xiansi, and Jiang Yuanting from Guanhuangtun reported that their farmland was about seven or eight li from the Yitong River. Recently, continuous rain has caused mountain water to flow down, but the existing ditch was blocked by Korean residents, preventing the water from flowing downstream. Their farmland is currently flooded, and if the original state is not restored promptly, the damage in the future will be immeasurable. Furthermore, the Third Branch Bureau reported that about one li west of Jiangjiawobao Village, there are 73 Korean people and 2 Japanese police officers still digging ditches and surveying for the construction of a reservoir, planning to sow seeds in about one or two days. We are requested to negotiate and stop them from proceeding. Upon investigation, the aforementioned water diversion project, as a result of a joint investigation by both parties, indeed infringes upon the landowners' rights and is significantly harmful to the nearby farmland. This project violates the purpose of the agreement reached by both parties on June 8th to resolve this case in a fair and optimal manner after investigation. Naturally, it cannot continue. The original state should be restored swiftly to appease the farmers' earnest hope. According to the reported situation, if your side does not immediately stop them, all resulting complications and consequences will be your responsibility, as stated in our letter of June 12th. This letter is hereby sent for your attention. We urge you to faithfully implement the previous agreement and promptly respond to our original letter regarding resolving the remaining issues of this case, so as to bring it to a conclusion. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Tashiro, Japanese Consul stationed in Changchun, June 23rd.</p>
<p>▲Letter from the Japanese Consulate to the Municipal Affairs Office: Respectfully, regarding the issue of Korean people cultivating paddy fields at Wanbaoshan, we have previously conducted a joint investigation with your office. However, due to differing opinions on the outcome, negotiations have remained stalled, which is truly regrettable. Subsequently, on the 24th of this month, we had another face-to-face discussion. Although I expressed my sincere views at that time, there was ultimately no hope of reaching a completely unified agreement. However, the Korean side is quite anxious as the sowing season has passed. If I were to order them to stop the damming construction, this year's paddy field cultivation</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>would be equivalent to abandoning it, making it difficult to stop. Therefore, while continuing negotiations, I still hope for a satisfactory resolution. However, to accommodate the wishes of the Korean people, they should be allowed to implement the damming and sowing to see what the outcome will be and whether the water damage is as serious as the opposing farmers fear. This is a last resort for me in my position. I sincerely hope that our two sides will work together to take the best measures to prevent unfortunate events. Otherwise, in the event that unfortunate events occur due to negligence in prevention, a thorough investigation should be conducted to clarify responsibility. The above situation was already discussed in person on the 24th, and this letter is sent for your attention. Respectfully addressed to Zhou, Director of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, Tashiro Shigenori, Consul stationed in Changchun, June 26th.</p>
<p>▲Letter from the Japanese Consul to the Municipal Affairs Office: Respectfully, according to a report, on the afternoon of the 24th, at 8 PM, two Korean people were walking near Mashao Kou when they encountered 14 patrol police officers from the Second District Public Security Bureau, who tied them up with ropes, beat them, robbed them of the millet and gold they were carrying, and then protected the local farmers from the side, destroying about 18 zhang of the excavated waterway and repeatedly firing shots to threaten the Korean people. Afterward, they left with the farmers, heading west. The official authorities of your country have absolutely no intention of rejecting the Korean people, as your director has repeatedly stated. Now that the aforementioned incident has occurred, it is difficult for us to continue to trust your officials, and it may lead to a situation where we have no choice but to directly protect the Korean people. I sincerely hope that such acts of violence by your officials will not occur again in the future and that you will seek appropriate measures. The above situation was already conveyed in person by a staff member on the 25th, and this letter is sent for your attention. Respectfully addressed to Zhou, Director of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, Tashiro Shigenori, Consul stationed in Changchun, June 26th.</p>
<p>▲Letter from the Municipal Affairs Office to the Japanese Consul: Respectfully, your official document No. 47 of June 26th has been received. Regarding the case of Koreans at Wanbaoshan forcefully excavating civilian land to dig waterways, intending to build a dam across the river to forcibly divert the river for irrigation, a joint on-site investigation by both parties revealed that not only would the completion of the dam cause enormous damage to the farmland along the river, but also the right of ownership of the land through which the waterway passes is being infringed upon. More than 40 households of farmland are cut into two sections, causing inconvenience for each household's cultivation, and resulting in permanent and unlimited losses. Furthermore, navigation and transportation between Changchun and Nong'an counties will also be interrupted due to the completion of the dam. All of this is not permitted by current laws and regulations, and any country or any nation would not allow such unreasonable actions. The actual situation after the aforementioned joint investigation was formally communicated in our letter of June 11th. If your consul orders the Korean people to continue the aforementioned illegal acts, infringing upon the landowners and farmers' legitimate and inherent rights, your side should bear full responsibility for all disputes and losses that may arise in the future, as formally communicated in our letter of June 12th, with a solemn statement. Based on the aforementioned reasons, it is expected that you have noted our response. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Tashiro, Japanese Consul stationed in Changchun, June 27th.</p>
<p>▲Letter from the Municipal Affairs Office to the Japanese Consul: Respectfully, your official document No. 48 of June 26th has been read. Regarding the section of the Wanbaoshan waterway that was filled in for about 18 zhang on the afternoon of the 24th, our investigation revealed that it was indeed the farmers in that area who took advantage of their free time to selectively fill in the waterway dug by the Korean people on their farmland, which caused much inconvenience for their cultivation and travel, to restore it to its original state for ease of passage and to avoid hindering farming operations. The claim in your letter that 14 police officers were present to protect them is, according to the Changchun County Government's investigation, completely unfounded. Based on the aforementioned reasons, this response is sent for your attention. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Tashiro, Japanese Consul stationed in Changchun, June 27th.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Rally to Protect Overseas Chinese Held in Hankou</h3>
<p>▲Decision to Form Anti-Japanese Associations of People from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since the Wanbaoshan Incident occurred, the whole country has been outraged. People from all walks of life in Hankou also held an anti-Japanese rally to protect overseas Chinese at the Municipal Party Headquarters at 10 AM on the 18th. Party headquarters at all levels and mass organizations attended. Liu Yun, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, was elected as the chairman to report on the progress of the Wanbaoshan case and the Japanese people's active conspiracy to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. Proposals were then discussed, and it was resolved to organize an anti-Japanese association of people from all walks of life in Hankou. The congress first stipulated that farmers' associations, chambers of commerce, labor unions, and free professional groups would be the preparatory organizations, and the dockworkers' union, the first district farmers' association, the municipal chamber of commerce, the Wuhan Daily, the Pinghan Railway Workers' Union, the Seamen's Union, and the Textile Workers' Union were designated to be responsible for the preparations. Finally, the chairman read aloud two telegrams addressed to the Central National Government requesting a serious protest to Japan and to the whole country requesting unified anti-Japanese action, which were immediately passed. The telegram to the Central National Government read: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: This time, the Japanese people used ignorant Korean farmers in Wanbaoshan, Jilin Province, in our country, to forcefully dig ditches for water and arbitrarily destroy good farmland, and instigated the police to demonstrate and suppress Chinese farmers. At the same time, they incited Korean people throughout the territory, triggering a major anti-Chinese riot, slaughtering the lives of our overseas Chinese and plundering their property, resulting in an unprecedented catastrophe. The news of the police arrived, and we were extremely indignant. The Japanese imperialists' aggression against China has never been a matter of a single day. The May Thirtieth Incident and the Jinan Incident were all manifestations of their aggressive acts. All Chinese people have been gnashing their teeth at this, and this time's act of using a knife to kill is particularly insidious. What crime have the overseas Chinese committed to suffer such a great disaster? This is an extreme insult to our country, and if this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? We earnestly request your ministry and government to raise a serious negotiation with Japan in order to save the lives of overseas Chinese and maintain national rights. The electric message cannot express the extreme indignation. Sincerely, the Congress of Representatives of All Circles in Hankou. The telegram to the country was similar and is omitted.

<h3>Hooliganism Case by the Japanese Garrison in Huanggu Tun</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: It is common practice for Japanese military and police to stab Chinese people in various parts of the Northeast, and it is not surprising. At about 4 PM on the 14th of this month, another incident occurred near the San Dong Bridge on the South Manchurian Railway in Huanggu Tun, where Japanese garrison troops recklessly attacked Chinese pedestrians, causing a dispute, which led to the dispatch of a large number of armed Japanese police to surround the police station in charge. The details are as follows: A few steps from the scene of the incident, on the left side of the San Kong Bridge on the South Manchurian Railway, is the San Dong Bridge Police Station, which is under the jurisdiction of the Second Branch Bureau of the Commercial Port. The South Manchurian Railway track is on the bridge, and there is a Japanese soldier's post. Normally, from their high vantage point, they randomly throw stones at Chinese pedestrians, often causing head injuries and bloodshed, leaving people helpless. Therefore, people generally regard the bridge arch as a "tiger's mouth," and they would never dare to pass through it rashly unless absolutely necessary. At 4:10 PM on the afternoon of that day, two Chinese men, Shen Yuhuai and Wu Xizhen, both from Hebei Province, who made a living as rickshaw pullers, went to Xita to visit friends. On their way back, when they approached the San Dong Bridge, they suddenly saw a Japanese garrison soldier, fully armed, carrying a large rifle, marching proudly forward. Thinking that the Japanese soldier was following closely behind them, and fearing that he might be drunk or looking for trouble, they walked to the side to make way in order to avoid a conflict. As the two rickshaw pullers were walking, they were discussing private matters, talking as they walked. Then, Shen looked back and saw that the Japanese soldier was still following behind them, acting suspiciously. So he whispered to Wu Xizhen, "Let's walk to the side, the Japanese soldier is coming." Wu immediately moved to the sidewalk on the side of the road. Unexpectedly, the Japanese soldier deliberately provoked a fight, catching up and shouting, "What are you doing?" After this barely comprehensible Chinese phrase, he immediately raised his gun and struck Shen Yuhuai on the head, breaking a hole above Shen's left eyebrow, causing his eyeball to bulge out, and blood to flow profusely. The two rickshaw pullers were strong and powerful, so they joined forces to hold the perpetrator and dragged him to the San Dong Bridge Police Station to reason with him. While they were wrestling with each other, officer Li Jingkui and guard Ren Yuxiu, who were resting, caught sight of them. They went forward to inquire about the cause of the matter and then went to the police station together. After questioning by station chief Tan Shangwu, the Japanese soldier was first asked his name and unit number, but he did not answer. When asked why he hit someone, he also did not answer, pretending not to understand Chinese. He roared and shouted inside the police station, and even tried to rush out. The police, because he was caught in the act of assaulting someone, could not let him go. They gathered both parties in a room while telephoning Director Hu of the Second Branch Bureau in charge to ask for instructions. After receiving the report, the bureau urgently telegraphed the General Bureau and the Office of the Diplomatic Commissioner to send a translator to the scene for questioning. This was delayed for half an hour. At this time, the Japanese police patrolling the bridge had already reported to the Japanese garrison via telephone. After the report, they also gathered about three nearby Japanese soldiers and went to the police station to demand the release of the man, using rude language and threatening to use force. The situation was extremely urgent, but our negotiators were delayed. At 4:50 PM, the Japanese garrison had already dispatched a large team, including more than one hundred soldiers, more than fifty cavalrymen, and more than fifty armed policemen. The military and police officers traveled in more than ten pedal cars in front, followed by infantry and cavalry, in a threatening manner, as if facing a major enemy. After arriving at the police station, they immediately surrounded it on all sides, set up checkpoints along the way, and cut off traffic. In the end, with their superior numbers and power, our police had no choice but to let them do what they wanted. As a result, they kidnapped the Japanese soldier who caused the trouble and the two Chinese men. After the Japanese soldier who caused the trouble left the police station, he was briefly interrogated by a Japanese officer in a lookout on the side of the railroad (the building had two rooms with a telephone and radio for the Japanese soldiers on the railroad to take shelter from the wind and rain). Then he was released. The kidnapped Shen and Wu were also taken to the building and beaten with whips, wooden sticks, and iron rods without asking the reason, causing serious injuries. At about 5 PM, our negotiators finally arrived, and Director Hu, Section Chief Lin, and Section Chief Han of the Second Branch Bureau went to the lookout to negotiate with the Japanese side. First, they requested the withdrawal of the surrounding military and police. The Japanese side then ordered the police and soldiers to return to their units. Our side then demanded the return of the kidnapped Chinese, but they were already on their last breath. After four hours of negotiations, at about 9 PM, the Japanese side finally agreed to make concessions, sending the injured Chinese to the Japanese Army Hospital for treatment. The medical expenses were to be borne by the Japanese side, and they apologized to our side, resolving to punish the Japanese soldiers who caused the trouble, and guaranteed that the same incident would not happen again in the future. At 12 PM on the 15th, the San Dong Bridge police and the Japanese garrison met under the bridge to show that they were as friendly as before. A case of hooliganism was thus concluded. (July 15th)</p>
<h3>Recent Military News from Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The price of Shanxi banknotes has been plummeting in Taiyuan recently, with the exchange rate changing several times a day. Yesterday morning, one yuan of silver could only be exchanged for three yuan and twenty cents of banknotes, but in the evening it rose to more than three yuan and fifty cents. As a result, prices have soared, and the society is showing signs of unrest.

<h3>Business Tax Rate in Jiangsu Province Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>▲Temporarily Handled in Accordance with the Revised Regulations of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>▲New Tax Law to be Implemented Starting in the Twenty-First Year</p>
<p>Xu Baoying, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Finance, previously proposed to the Provincial Government Committee that the business tax rate in this province should be temporarily handled in accordance with the revised regulations of the Ministry of Finance, and that the new tax law should be implemented when business licenses are renewed in the twenty-first year after a trial period of three quarters. The Provincial Government Committee has resolved to approve the proposal. His submission stated: In accordance with the instructions of the Supreme Government, the order of the Executive Yuan, and the order of the National Government, a copy of the Business Tax Law is forwarded, and the Department is instructed to instruct all counties and bureaus to comply with it, etc. In accordance with this, compliance is required. However, an examination of the standard for taxation in the Business Tax Law shows that it is specified as three types: (A) Those who use the total business income as the standard, pay a tax rate of 2/1000 to 10/1000; (B) Those who use the business capital as the standard, pay a tax rate of 4/1000 to 10/1000; (C) Those who use the net business income as the standard, pay a tax rate of 2% to 10%. The previous revision of the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Collection Regulations by the Ministry of Finance stipulated two standards: (1) Those who use the business volume as the standard, the tax rate is from 1/1000 to 10/1000; (2) Those who use the capital amount as the standard, the tax rate is from 2/1000 to 20/1000. Comparing the three standards set by the Legislative Yuan with the two standards set by the Ministry of Finance, it is found that there is an additional net income standard, which was not included in the original regulations. Furthermore, the tax rate set by the Legislative Yuan starts at 2/1000 for business volume and 4/1000 for capital amount, which is different from the original tax rate set by the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the net income rate is set at 2% to 10%, which was not included in the original tax rate. After the promulgation of this new tax law, the original text should be followed, and the provincial government should revise the rate according to the business situation. However, upon investigation, disputes in various counties have only just been resolved since the initial collection of business tax in Jiangsu Province, and it is not appropriate to make further changes. It is proposed that the business tax rate for this year's collection be temporarily handled in accordance with the revised regulations of the Ministry of Finance to avoid further disputes. After a trial period of three quarters, and after the business situation has been investigated and there is some clarity, the new tax law will be implemented starting in the twenty-first year when business licenses are renewed. Is this appropriate? This bill is submitted for public decision.</p>

<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Discusses Relief for Disaster Victims in Northwest China</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After Fujian Chairman Yang Shuzhuang returned, he immediately discussed providing relief to the disaster victims in western and northern Fujian who had been ravaged by bandits, and designated Zheng Baoqing, Chen Peikun, He Gonggan, Lin Zhiyuan, and Cheng Shixun as five committee members to properly plan and handle the matter immediately.

<h3>After the Cancellation of the Fujian Anti-Smoking Investigation Office</h3>
<p>▲All Circles Request Punishment for Yuan Jin and Ma Deji</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The situation of opposing the Anti-Smoking Investigation Office in various circles of Fujian is extremely enthusiastic. The office has now received an order from the Central Anti-Smoking Committee to be abolished. The Provincial Government has also instructed the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee that the province's anti-smoking efforts will still be the responsibility of the committee and should not be relaxed in the slightest. The Anti-Smoking Association has been investigating those who were previously involved in fundraising, sending them to the Public Security Bureau for punishment. At the same time, the Fuzhou Addiction Treatment Society has also initiated a civil anti-smoking campaign, requesting the Fire Brigade Federation to notify each shop's fire brigade to find out the brand names and addresses of opium dens, and notify landlords to move them out within a time limit. If they fail to do so, the district police station will be notified to arrest them and seal them. If a tenant is found selling opium in the future, the landlord will be jointly liable. Furthermore, the All Circles Anti-Smoking Support Association stated that Yuan Jin, while serving as the Director of the Mawei Shipyard, plotted to establish an Anti-Smoking Investigation Office, and Ma Deji, the former Director of the Shanghai Shipyard, also ran around and smoothed things over on his behalf. This was destroying the anti-smoking effort and tarnishing the reputation of the navy. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of the Navy requesting punishment. The original telegram is recorded below: To the Ministry of the Navy in Nanjing: Recently, Yuan Jin went to Fujian to open an Anti-Smoking Investigation Office, publicly selling opium, and also instigated his henchman Ma Deji to make arrangements everywhere, hoping to profit from it. He does not comply with the government's orders and does not care about public opinion. He is insane. Yuan Jin, etc., are subordinates of your ministry and are engaged in this harmful opium business, which is an affront to the public. It is requested that he be transferred back and severely punished to serve as a warning and to maintain the reputation of your ministry and protect the glorious history of anti-smoking in our province. We earnestly hope. (July 16th)</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Verdict on the Bloodshed Case at Beizhakou: Zeng Haishan, a resident of Beizhakou, was severely wounded in the head by thugs last winter, narrowly escaping death.

<p>Robbery Occurs at Lengdu Bridge: In the Lengdu Bridge area, District Two (Jingyun City), Village Chief Miao Shunjin, a farmer by profession, lives in modest comfort. He has one son and two daughters. The eldest daughter, aged nineteen, was recently betrothed to a certain family through her uncle's matchmaking. The engagement ceremony was scheduled for the fifteenth of this month. The groom's family had sent forty yuan in cash and gold engagement tokens, totaling over two hundred yuan, which attracted the attention of bandits. Around one in the morning the day before yesterday, five or six bandits suddenly arrived, armed with pistols, and broke into the house. They demanded silence and ransacked the place, rummaging through boxes and chests. After half an hour, they left, each carrying stolen goods. Upon inspection, the losses were estimated at over three hundred yuan. Village Chief Miao, fearing retaliation from the bandits, was reluctant to report the incident to the authorities. It is reported that residents in the area have been robbed four or five times before, but the losses were minor. During the robbery at the Miao residence, the bandits loudly called out, "Is Village Chief Miao at home?" This suggests that the bandits were familiar with the area. If the public security authorities conduct a thorough investigation, it should not be difficult to solve the case soon.</p>

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Murder of Husband Case: Perpetrator Apprehended: Zhao Quangen, a farmer from Changxicun Village, about two li from Lihe Bridge in the second district of Wu County, was strangled to death last winter by his wife, Zhao Zhang, and Zhao Xiaolin.

<p>Continuation of the Mishandled Bone Setting Case: The case of negligence causing injury, in which the President of the Provincial Hospital, Wang Yuanchen, was sued by Yi Ruichang, the manager of a copper and tin shop, resumed hearing yesterday. The courtroom was crowded with onlookers. In addition to the plaintiff and defendant, the designated doctors from Hongren Hospital and the doctors who had treated the plaintiff were present. Judge Jin opened the court at 10:00 a.m. In addition to hiring lawyer Hu Zhen, the defendant also hired lawyer Peng Qi from Suzhou to defend him. First, the plaintiff, Yi Ruichang, stated that he had been admitted to the hospital last year to treat a leg fracture. The defendant had broken his leg bone while examining it, and the subsequent bone setting was unsuccessful, resulting in a disability. Wang Yuanchen argued that the breaking of the leg bone was due to Yi's syphilis, which made his bones fragile, and that imperfect bone setting was common in the medical field and he could not be held responsible. The plaintiff argued that since the defendant knew that the bone was fragile, he should have been careful and should not have broken it. Lawyer Peng argued that the time between the bone fracture and the filing of the lawsuit was more than six months, and that the initial complaint was not signed by the plaintiff himself, so the case was not valid. After the judge clarified the matter, it was determined that although the bone fracture occurred earlier, it took three months of bone setting before it was determined that it could not be healed. The plaintiff also admitted that the initial lawsuit was his intention. The assessor from Hongren Hospital stated that the set bone was indeed not aligned correctly. Due to bad weather, X-rays could not be taken, and only a rough diagram was drawn. As a result, the defendant requested another medical assessment with X-rays as evidence, and was willing to bear the costs to protect his reputation. The court agreed, and the court adjourned at 12:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Strict Order to Demolish Dikes and Embankments Illegally Occupying the Yue Lake: Farmers in the Tangjiapan and Laoguanzui areas of the tenth district of the county built dikes and embankments in the Yue Lake during the warlord era, reclaiming land from the water and eventually occupying it as their own property. The matter was reported to the Construction Committee, which repeatedly ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department to instruct the Jiangdu County Construction Bureau to jointly investigate and determine whether demolition was necessary. The owners who had illegally occupied the land were ordered to demolish the structures voluntarily, but they failed to comply. In April of this year, the county government ordered the 8th and 10th Public Security Sub-bureaus to enforce the demolition. However, Zhang Zhaozhi, Tan Dehong, and others came forward on behalf of the owners, requesting a temporary suspension due to the imminent wheat harvest and the high water level. The 10th District Office reported the situation to the county, which in turn reported it to the Construction Department for review, resulting in a delay in the demolition. The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Office's Jiangdu Section Works Office believes that the canal water level, which is still over one zhang and six chi despite the opening of the dams flowing into the Yangtze River, is affected by the illegal occupation of the Yue Lake through the construction of dikes and embankments in the Tangjiapan and Laoguanzui areas. It has submitted another request to the provincial government to order the demolition within a specified period. It has been learned that the county government received an order from the Construction Department yesterday, stating that the dikes and embankments were severely hindering water conservancy and had not been demolished to date, indicating negligence on the part of the county magistrate. The order instructs the 8th and 10th Public Security Sub-bureau chiefs to enforce the demolition and report the results for verification. Failure to comply will result in severe punishment for the sub-bureau chiefs.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Rising River Water is Concerning: The amount of water flowing through the canals here has been increasing day by day. In addition to the salt canal being full after being diverted by the Shuangjin Sluice Gate, the Yangzhuang Small Dam was breached recently. The former course of the Yellow River, which had been silted up, is also full of water, overflowing onto the banks. The bridge boats at the North Gate and South Gate in Qingjiang are becoming insufficient. The Chamber of Commerce has purchased four bridge boats from the Huai'an Customs to add to the existing ones. The small steamship companies received a telegram from Zhenjiang yesterday, deciding to suspend the sale of long-distance downriver tickets tomorrow (the 16th). According to a telegram from Zhao Luqi, director of the Pizhou Dike Works Office, the water from Huai and Yi in the upper reaches is still rising, and the Qinfan Zhichun has reached two zhang and four chi. River affairs personnel who have witnessed the current situation cannot help but feel deeply concerned.</p>
<p>County Government Executes Four Bandits: The Huaiyin County Government, based on the report from the local Police Brigade, presented four bandits named Dong Degao, Su Guofu, Shao Weibang, and Shi Weixiang for adjudication. After interrogation, the bandits proved to be extremely cunning. However, after the victims Liu Bi and Chen Fu testified in court, the bandits Dong Degao, Su Guofu, and Shao Weibang confessed to the kidnapping and extortion of Liu Bi's family, and Shi Weixiang confessed to the kidnapping and extortion of Chen Fu's family. The county government telegraphed the provincial government for approval and was granted permission to execute the four bandits. Yesterday evening, the county government received the reply telegram. This morning (the 15th) at 10:00 a.m., County Magistrate He extracted the four men, verified their identities, bound them, and sent them to the execution ground outside the West Gate for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Silkworm Seed Farm Promotes Autumn Silkworms: The Jiashan Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Farm, located in Si Lane in the county seat, has been issuing Liqiu brand spring silkworm seeds since last year. The general rearing households have reported good harvests and have all welcomed the seeds. As a result, this year's spring silkworm seeds have already been set, and there are few remaining. The farm has recently seen the government's repeated promotion of autumn silkworms and intends to increase farmers' income by using discarded mulberry leaves and surplus labor. It has specially produced autumn silkworm seeds for sale. Each sheet of silkworm eggs can yield about thirty catties of cocoons, and the selling price is similar to that of spring silkworm cocoons. It is reported that the farm, fearing that there are not many autumn silkworm rearing households and no dedicated cocoon shops, has established its own cocoon shop to benefit silkworm farmers and promote the rearing of autumn silkworm cocoons produced by the farm.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Eating Poisonous Mushrooms Leads to Two Deaths: In the Caojia Lane area of Yangfen, near Shangqianbu in Hang County, the wife of Li Jinsheng picked many fragrant mushrooms on the mountain yesterday. She brought them back to cook with mustard greens. Her mother came to visit and was invited to eat with them, using the mushrooms as a side dish. After eating, they suddenly complained of abdominal pain. Jinsheng returned home and, seeing the situation, realized they had been poisoned. He hired people to carry his mother-in-law back to Fengjiaqiao in Dongtang. Before they reached home, she died from the poison. His wife also died after medical treatment failed. Several other farmers in the area had also eaten the mushrooms, but fortunately they vomited them out and were unharmed. Chickens and ducks that ate the vomit also died. The police station has been notified to ban the picking of the mushrooms.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Foil Tax Bureau to be Abolished: The revenue of Zhejiang Province in the 20th year of the Republic is severely insufficient. The Finance Department has decided that the annual expenditure of the Foil Tax Bureau is about 30,000 yuan. This special tax has always been handled by the foil shop operators in Shaoxing, and the bureau is only responsible for supervision. The duties are extremely simple. With the current financial difficulties in the province and the implementation of austerity measures, the bureau is deemed unnecessary. An order has been issued to wind up the affairs of the bureau, and it will be abolished from next month.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Robbery and Assault Case Occurs in Huang Guolin: Zhao Feng's small money shop in Shenjiao Village, near Huang Guolin in Yin County, was doing reasonably well. Around 8:00 p.m. last night, five or six bandits speaking in mixed dialects and wearing short, solid-color clothes suddenly broke in. One bandit pulled out a pistol and demanded silence, while the others held wooden sticks and cut all the telephone lines. Fortunately, it was still early, and a neighbor alerted the police by ringing a gong. The bandits panicked and fled southeast. It is reported that the loss was not significant, about thirty yuan. However, a neighbor named Zhou was shot in the foot, and two shop assistants were also injured by the wooden sticks. After hearing the news, the Huang Guolin Public Security Bureau dispatched police to pursue the bandits.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Forty-One Villages in Tianle Vie for the Linpu Police District: A dispute has arisen between Xiaoshan and Shaoxing counties over the issue of the Linpu Town police district. Xiaoshan County Magistrate Du submitted a request to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval to include the entire town of the police district in Xiaoshan County in order to unify administration. However, Shao County Public Security Bureau Chief Mo Rundong initially disagreed, arguing that the old boundaries should be maintained and there was no need to separate them. Now, forty-one villages in Tianle Township have issued a declaration and telegraphed the provincial government, stating their reasons and requesting the Shaoxing Association in Hangzhou to forward their concerns. They are protesting County Magistrate Du of Xiaoshan's encroachment on Shaoxing County's police governance rights. As a result, the opinions have deepened, and the case is becoming more difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Husband and Wife Electrocuted Simultaneously: On the evening of the 18th, two farmers, Mo Zhaoyou and others, from the Caiyu Bridge area outside the South Gate of Xiaoshan, were returning home from working in the fields when they encountered heavy rain and lightning. The farmers were electrocuted to death. Unexpectedly, his wife, who was visiting relatives, was returning home at the same time and was also electrocuted to death by the field. The two were about one li apart and were both struck by lightning. This is truly a strange occurrence.</p>
<p>Clothes Transport Boat Robbed: At midnight on the 18th, a night boat traveling from Shaoxing to Xiaoshan near Qianqing and Xiaoyangzhou on the West Xiaojiang was forced ashore and robbed by five bandits disguised as passengers. The bandits looted the passengers' luggage and money, totaling over one hundred yuan. They also stole over twenty catties of white silk and several bolts of satin. They fired shots in the air as a warning and fled towards Guantang Road.</p>
<h3>Qu County</h3>
<p>New and Old County Magistrates Hand Over: Xu Zhigui, the county magistrate of Qu County, has been transferred by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the vacancy will be filled by Wu Bokuan. It has been learned that County Magistrate Wu arrived in Qu County on the 14th and is scheduled to take over on the 17th. Local people and agencies in the county who know County Magistrate Wu's past history are very welcome. They have been visiting him and providing detailed accounts of the local matters that need to be promoted and reformed.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Pei Xiyu of the Wuhu District Court Procuratorate</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I have recently read a news item in your newspaper's foreign news section (July 4th) titled "Major Upheaval in Wuhu's Legal Circles." I would like to point out the following inaccuracies regarding my reputation: (1) Our court issues arrest warrants with limited validity periods. Arrest warrants are different from wanted notices. If an arrest cannot be made, the bailiff should return the arrest warrant for cancellation. Wanted notices, on the other hand, have no expiration date. This is clear to anyone with basic legal knowledge and is a common practice in all courts. The arrest warrants issued in the Mingxing case, which I handled, were all returned for cancellation because the individuals could not be found. The case files are all available for verification. This is one inaccuracy in your newspaper's report. (2) Prosecutors can only exercise prosecutorial powers. Fines and detention are judicial powers and are the responsibility of the judges. I would never dare to overstep my authority. Your newspaper's report that Peng Songqing's assault case was only fined and not detained is something that someone familiar with the law would not say. In conclusion, the higher authorities have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate this case, and the truth will be determined. It is inappropriate to damage my reputation based on one-sided accounts. I fear that the rumors are inaccurate and have written to request a correction. I hope this is granted.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Pei Xiyu, Prosecutor of the Wuhu District Court</p>
<p>July 16th</p>

The cruelty and suffering cannot be described. Relief and comfort require substantial funds. We believe that overseas Chinese have contributed greatly to the revolution and nation-building. Whenever there are tragedies and disasters in the country, they contribute generously and take the lead. Now that the overseas Chinese in Korea have suffered the tragedy of being massacred and destroyed, we, the compatriots of the whole country, should rush to their aid. The first committee meeting of this association has decided to send a telegram to home and abroad to raise relief funds and to establish an economic committee to be responsible for safekeeping.

<h3>Active Promotion of Boycotting Japanese Goods Amidst Anti-Japanese Sentiments</h3>
<p>▲ Strict Measures to be Taken Against New Orders</p>
<p>▲ Design Committee to Convene Tomorrow</p>
<p>Following resolutions passed by the Anti-Japanese Aid China Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to sever economic ties with Japan, active measures are underway. All plans are being implemented based on effective and sustainable principles. Furthermore, the Association has found instances of backdating order forms for recent goods ordered, which is considered a betrayal of the nation. The Association will take the strictest measures against these goods. The following is a summary of news gathered yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ Design Meeting: The first executive meeting of the Anti-Japanese Aid China Association resolved to establish a Design Committee, including economic experts, business leaders, and key figures from customs brokerage and transportation industries. The committee will consist of nine to twenty-seven members. Eleven members have already been nominated, including Li Quanshi, Zhu Yinong, and Chen Songyuan. It is reported that Chen Songyuan, the convener of the committee, recognizing the urgency of the design process, has scheduled the first Design Meeting for 4:00 PM on the 21st to formulate concrete plans for boycotting Japanese goods. These plans will be submitted to the full committee for deliberation and implementation.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Chamber of Commerce: The Anti-Japanese Aid China Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Regarding the guiding principles for dealing with Japanese goods, as resolved in the first meeting of our committee, (A) goods already ordered should be returned promptly; (B) goods ordered but not yet arrived at the port should have shipments halted; (C) goods already in warehouses but not yet paid for should not be claimed; (D) goods already purchased should be registered with the Association first and temporarily suspended from distribution. Those who violate the above four measures will be severely punished according to the stipulated disciplinary regulations." Aside from the registration rules and disciplinary regulations which are being drafted and will be announced later, we are first sending the handling measures for your records, urging your esteemed Chamber to promptly inform all businesses in the city to comply in unison to avoid any delays. Addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>▲ Strict Investigation of Japanese Goods: The Anti-Japanese Aid China Association sent letters to customs brokers, dockworkers, and industrial and commercial groups yesterday, stating: "The recent massacre of overseas Chinese compatriots by Koreans instigated by the Japanese has aroused righteous indignation among all Chinese people. Therefore, all sectors of this city have unanimously resolved to permanently sever economic ties with Japan to demonstrate our ultimate determination. If any Chinese person possesses even a shred of conscience, they should be inspired to act in unison. However, news reports indicate that some opportunistic and treacherous merchants are taking advantage of the situation to purchase Japanese goods, sacrificing the blood of our overseas Chinese compatriots to enrich themselves. If this is permissible, what is not? Your associations are undoubtedly familiar with the movement of goods through customs declarations and loading/unloading. In addition to assigning personnel to secretly investigate, we hereby inform you that any purchases of Japanese goods should be reported to this Association at any time for investigation and handling. The success of the Anti-Japanese Movement relies on this." Addressed to the Customs Brokers Association, Customs Brokerage Industry Association, Dockworkers Union, and Transportation Industry Association.</p>
<p>▲ Party Headquarters' Recommendations: In light of the failures of past anti-Japanese efforts, the Third District Party Headquarters, after its twelfth meeting, resolved on seven measures to recommend to the Municipal Executive Committee, instructing the Anti-Japanese Aid China Association to comply. The following are excerpts of the measures: (1) All Japanese goods seized should be burned and no funds should be collected; (2) The handling of seized goods should not exceed three days; responsible individuals will be subject to sanctions by the Supervisory Committee if the deadline is missed; (3) Those who offer bribes and confess will have the bribe money returned by the Association; if they do not confess and are reported, the bribe money will be used as a reward for the informant, and the briber will be punished equally with the recipient of the bribe; (4) Regardless of the amount of the bribe, if there is solid evidence or witnesses, the recipient should be immediately executed; (5) Disciplinary regulations, handling measures, and organizational outlines should be approved and implemented by the All-Circles Representatives Assembly; (6) All Japanese goods seized daily must be published in newspapers; (7) The All-Circles Representatives Assembly must be convened once a month. It is reported that a statement of reasons has been prepared and submitted to the Municipal Executive Committee.</p>
<p>▲ Discussions in Various Sectors: (1) The Customs Brokers Association has scheduled a meeting to discuss measures to refuse to declare Japanese goods; (2) The Cotton Cloth Trade Association has scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM on July 22nd to discuss voluntary boycott measures during the second session of its general assembly; (3) Announcement (No. 4) from the Silk Thread Industry Association to its members: Regarding an urgent announcement, according to reports on the 16th of this month, "The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Aid China Assembly declared that, based on the resolutions of the All-Circles Assembly on the 13th of this month, an economic severance with Japan will be strictly enforced from today onwards. If anyone privately imports Japanese goods after the 14th, they will be subject to the strictest sanctions according to the measures to be decided in the future. Please pay close attention." The Wanbaoshan Massacre of overseas Chinese compatriots is entirely the beginning of the Japanese imperialist plan to invade our country, which is still progressing. The conspiracy is being widely reported, and the whole country is indignant. The business community of this city has voluntarily initiated a joint organization of industrial, commercial, and academic circles to form the Anti-Japanese Aid China Assembly to unanimously carry out the economic severance with Japan, as a backing for government negotiations. This association deeply sympathizes with this patriotic action. The third executive committee meeting on the 16th of this month resolved to notify all members that all Japanese goods ordered and currently in stock as of the 16th of this month must be reported to this association with detailed information on the name and quantity of the goods within one week (by the 24th of this month) for verification during inspections. From the 17th of this month onwards, no further orders or purchases of Japanese goods are allowed, except for previously ordered goods. Otherwise, this association will not be responsible. In addition to separate notifications, members are urged to fill out the registration form and submit it, and avoid making mistakes that may lead to severe penalties. This is extremely important. This announcement is hereby made. (Attached registration form). July 16th, 20th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Zhang Yuanxiong.</p>

<p>▲ To Prepare for the Implementation of the Factory Law</p>
<p>The National Government has decided that the Factory Law and the Regulations for the Implementation of the Factory Law will be implemented on August 1st. In order to prepare for the implementation of the Factory Law, the Social Affairs Bureau of this city established a factory inspection in January of this year. More than ten industries, including papermaking, matches, enamel, cotton spinning, machinery, silk reeling, and oil pressing, have been inspected. Now that the implementation date of the Factory Law is approaching, the inspection was stopped from the previous day and is being concluded.

The table of contents is as follows: (1) Factories in each industry; (2) Age of workers; (3) Illegal work in each industry; (4) Working hours, breaks, and holidays; (5) Wage matters in each industry; (6) Worker welfare undertakings; (7) Subsidies and compensation; (8) Work contracts, factory rules, leave procedures, and work rewards and punishments.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Dock Dues Dispute Between the Cotton Cloth, Customs Declaration, and Dock Industries</h3>
<p>▲ Entrusted to the Cotton Cloth Industry by the Hakka</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Cloth Association Notifies Members to Comply</p>
<p>The dispute between the cotton cloth and customs declaration industries over the collection of dock dues was mediated by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau without success, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was instructed to handle it properly. The Chamber repeatedly convened all parties for mediation. The cotton cloth industry refused to collect the dues because the dock dues had to be borne by the Hakka merchants. The customs declaration industry also refused to collect the dues because dock dues were traditionally included in the price of goods. The Hakka merchants, due to the lack of manpower to handle business matters, proposed entrusting the cotton cloth industry to handle the procedures for paying the dues. All parties insisted, and the dispute could not be resolved. The Chamber had no choice but to formulate a plan and report it to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. The Bureau, based on the handling of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, instructed the Hakka and Cotton Cloth Industry Association to comply. Now the Cotton Cloth Association has resolved to comply with the order, and the dispute can finally be resolved. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Order from the Social Affairs Bureau: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau instructed the Cotton Cloth Industry Association to comply, stating: "Regarding the issue of dock dues payment, the customs declaration and cotton cloth industries have been shirking responsibility. The Bureau previously ordered the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to investigate the responsibility of the business and mediate properly. According to the Chamber's report, the mediation has not been successful, and two measures are proposed: (1) The Hakka can entrust the cotton cloth industry to handle the procedures for paying dock dues; (2) The Hakka must be responsible for paying the full amount of the dues paid by the cotton cloth industry on their behalf and must not be short. Based on the review, the proposed measures are appropriate and should be approved. In addition to ordering the Hakka cotton cloth merchants to add one mace and three candareens of silver dock dues per single package and two mace and six candareens of silver per double package when paying the unified tax and additional fees, and to hand them over to the industry's firms for payment, the Association is ordered to inform the firms to comply and collect and pay the dues on their behalf. This is important." At the same time, the Sichuan, Shandong, Yantai, and Harbin merchants are ordered to comply.</p>
<p>▲ Letter from the Cotton Cloth Industry: The Cotton Cloth Industry Association convened the Executive Committee on the 18th to discuss dock dues. All committee members, including Chen Songyuan, attended and resolved to comply with the order from the Social Affairs Bureau. Yesterday, the Association notified its members, stating: "This Association was previously instructed by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 4th and 17th to inform its members that, from today onwards, an additional transportation fee (i.e., cartage) of three mace and four candareens of silver must be collected from the Hakka merchants for each piece of cotton cloth, and transferred to the customs declaration workers to alleviate their hardships, in accordance with past practice. On the 17th of this month, we continued to receive the order, stating: (Omitted) Since the outbreak of this case, responsible personnel within the Association have been running around and appealing, and sending letters and telegrams.

<h3>Pilot Strike Awaits Resolution at Today's Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ Members Insist on Not Resuming Work Unconditionally</p>
<p>Regarding the pilot strike involving foreign ships in Shanghai, after the Consular Body of the Jianghai Customs and the joint associations of British and American chambers of commerce held a joint meeting, they decided to order all members of the Pilot Association to resume work unconditionally starting today. When the Association received the notification from the Jianghai Customs, it had a meeting, but because of the short time and the different opinions of the members on the letter from the Jianghai Customs, the meeting on the afternoon before yesterday only reported the contents of the letter from the Jianghai Customs and did not vote. Yesterday was a Sunday and no formal meeting was convened. Only informal contacts were made between members. Whether to accept the letter from the Jianghai Customs and resume work will be discussed and resolved at a meeting at 9:30 AM today at the Association's office at No. 26, The Bund. The situation yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Contact Between Members: Yesterday was a Sunday, and no members attended the meeting, nor was there a formal meeting. However, there were some contacts between members. It was vaguely heard that they mostly suggested that if the three groups of the Jianghai Customs, etc., could agree to consider the one shilling and eight pence as the minimum pilotage fee after they resumed work, and then give a reasonable reply, the members would be willing to resume work first. Otherwise, the members all expressed dissatisfaction with the unconditional resumption of work as stated by Mr. Green, the port director of the Jianghai Customs.</p>
<p>▲ Pilot License: Regarding the re-issuance of pilot licenses that have been cancelled by the Jianghai Customs, a key official of the Customs said that it would probably be issued after receiving the reply from the Pilot Association today.</p>
<p>▲ American Consulate's Statement: A reporter from Xinsheng News interviewed the American Consul General who attended the joint meeting of the three groups yesterday and asked about the document received by the American Consulate from Mr. Green, the port director of the Jianghai Customs, regarding the pilot strike, and the three groups' handling of the Pilot Association if it does not accept the resumption of work. He replied that he had not yet received Mr. Green's document, so he could not comment. The unconditional order for the pilots to resume work was indeed decided by the meeting, but he could not be sure what would happen if the Pilot Association did not accept it.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Municipal Administration Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ The One Hundred and Eighty-Fifth Time</p>
<p>The Municipal Government held its 185th Municipal Administration Meeting on July 3rd, 20th year.

(2) The Secretariat of the Municipal Government has implemented the reorganization according to the new organization law on July 1st.

<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Prevents Foreign Fishing Vessels from Registering Under False Names</h3>
<p>▲ Drafted Measures to Submit to the Municipal Government for Approval</p>
<p>After the Japanese fishing vessels that encroached on fishing in Shanghai were investigated by the Customs Anti-Smuggling Department and the Naval Department's Coast Defense Patrol Office, and the vessels were dispatched to strictly inspect the waters outside the Wusongkou for Japanese fishing vessels privately smuggling, they have now disappeared. In order to prevent foreign fishing vessels from colluding with unscrupulous merchants to register under false names, the Shanghai Municipal Fisheries Guidance Center has drafted a total of ten measures to prevent and punish, detailing the reasons, and submitted them to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for review. After review, the Bureau has now submitted the report to the Municipal Government for approval. Once approved by the Municipal Government, the measures will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Chen Fugen Found Not Guilty in Extortion Case</h3>
<p>▲ Still Sent to Public Security Bureau for Further Verification</p>
<p>Chen Bingxiang, a Guangdong resident residing at 212 Miller Road, was kidnapped by bandits around 9 PM on June 17th on Morrison Road. Chen was quick-witted and escaped on the spot. However, from the 21st to the 27th of the same month, he successively received threatening letters from the bandit gang, demanding 18,000 yuan. They arranged a meeting inside the Shenchun Auto Shop lane on Connaught Road, requiring the money, wrapped in paper, to be thrown into a trash can in the lane, from where someone would retrieve it. Chen immediately reported this to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched detectives and arrested a suspect, Chen Fugen, a local. When questioned by the Special District Court, he denied the charges and retained Lawyer Da Yaoxian for his defense. The court ordered a date for the verdict. Yesterday, Judge Xiao presided over the Third Court and ruled Chen Fugen not guilty. Lawyer Li, representing the police station, stated that Chen Fugen was initially handed over to the police station by the Shanghai Six-Counties Public Security Bureau. Chen is now to be sent back to the Bureau, which the court approved.</p>
<h3>Street Construction in Sanlin Town</h3>
<p>The streets of Sanlin Town, Shanghai County's Fourth District, have been in disrepair for years. Bricks and stones are loose and the surface is uneven, causing extreme inconvenience for travelers. Last year, the town's district office sent a detailed survey request to the County Construction Bureau and drafted a widening plan. The Municipal Construction Committee also resolved on construction methods. Now, gentlemen from both inside and outside the district, including Tang Zichun, Zhang Shangyi, Zhou Tingxiu, Kang Xitao, Jin Liren, and Huo Guozhen, have initiated a fundraising campaign to carry out the construction. Yesterday, the first design committee meeting was held to discuss the implementation plan. Those present included the initiators Zhang Shangyi (represented by Cai Jun), Tang Zichun, Huo Guozhen, Kang Xitao (represented by Huo Wenxiang), as well as the Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Zhenyuan, District Chief Bi Xinzhai, County Party Department member Ding Renke, Town Chief Huo Guiliang, Yang Zhiqiang, Zhu Ruoquan, and more than ten others. District Chief Bi was elected as chairman. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Tang Zichun was elected as the road construction director; (2) Road construction materials will be the responsibility of Mr. Tang to negotiate, with assistance from the County Construction Bureau; (3) Funding will be divided into special donations (initiated by the responsible fundraisers), frontage donations (from property owners), and shop donations (from the Chamber of Commerce). These will be initiated today.</p>
<h3>Paint Apprentice Dies from Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 4:20 PM, painting work was in progress inside the Bund's Bank of China. A paint apprentice, Chen Yunchang, 17 years old, accidentally lost his footing and fell from a ladder, injuring his head. He was barely breathing. Someone called the police from 3243 Street, who transported him to Renji Hospital. He died despite emergency treatment. The hospital transferred the body to the coroner's office to await examination by the court.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Struck by Tram in French Concession</h3>
<p>At 8 PM last night, Car No. 14, a Route 5 tram traveling from Ximen to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station, was proceeding from Ximen towards the Siming Guild Hall behind the Xinxin Bridge Street in the French Concession. A man, approximately 40 years old, wearing a silk short jacket and trousers, was walking from south to north. As the tram approached, he was unable to avoid it and was struck. He suffered injuries to his left arm, head, and face, bleeding profusely. Fortunately, the Taiping Board pried him free, preventing amputation, but he was already unconscious. French-Vietnamese police arrived and transported the injured man and the tram to Renji Hospital for treatment. Reports suggest his injuries are severe and he may not survive.</p>
<h3>Trackings of Notable Figures</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Boqun and Wei Daoming took the night express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Wang Jiazhen took the night train out of Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Promotion of New Weights and Measures Cannot Be Delayed</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, regarding the implementation date of the new weights and measures system, deemed it inappropriate to request a postponement and sent a letter to the Oil Pressing Industry Association, stating: "Regarding your letter of the 16th requesting a transfer to the Social Affairs Bureau to postpone the implementation of the new weights and measures system for your industry until February 1st of the following year: This matter was discussed and resolved at the members' meeting on June 27th to request the Social Affairs Bureau to determine the implementation period of the new weights and measures system, and to temporarily exempt from inspection during the implementation period. Considering the situation, the implementation of the new system in our city is included in the first phase and has already been approved by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The unified weights and measures procedures set by our city were jointly determined by the Municipal Government and the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce as early as May of the 19th year. It is extremely difficult to overturn the decision made more than a year ago and request a postponement again. Therefore, after careful consideration, we had no choice but to make a temporary request for an implementation period, hoping for a transitional and gradual approach to avoid excessive conflicts. We subsequently received a reply from the Social Affairs Bureau stating that the inspection period set by our city was originally divided into three phases, with the first phase running from July 11th to September 26th, providing ample time for preparation. Zhabei is included in the second phase, and the Special District (i.e., the Concession) is included in the third phase, allowing even more time for preparation. Therefore, the inspection period is the implementation period and does not need to be determined separately. Furthermore, the punishment measures during inspection will not be strictly enforced. We have already copied the entire text of this order and issued a separate notice. As for industries such as salted meat, where foreign weights and measures are still using the old system, making transactions difficult, this association has also reported to the Social Affairs Bureau to be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for verification. The situation described by your association is largely the same. We should wait for the Social Affairs Bureau to receive the Ministry's approval and forward it to the association before issuing a further notice. The request for a postponement is based on the above-mentioned circumstances and is indeed inconvenient to forward."</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Promotion of Chinese Merchant Notary Services</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating that the notary public business should be staffed by Chinese merchants: "Regarding the request: At the members' meeting held by this association on June 27th, member representatives of the Huashang Yizhong Auction House, Luo Qinghua, Zhu Wenqi, Jiang Zigang, Shao Baoxing, Fang Jiaobo, Ge Jechen, and Zheng Chengqing, proposed the following: The fire insurance industry originated in European countries as a means of ensuring safety, which is an excellent practice. It has been promoted in our country for decades, but all methods are based on foreign merchants, and the insurance policies and articles of association used are all in foreign languages. The wording often favors one side over the other, so when an accident occurs and compensation is due, disputes often arise between the insured and the insurer. To impartially arbitrate these disputes, a third party must step in, the so-called notary public. Therefore, the notary public is extremely important to the interests and legal status of both parties. In European and American countries, those who engage in notary public duties must first be specially licensed by the government, given a business license, and registered with the government office before they can perform their duties. Foreign merchant notary firms, in their capacity as foreign notaries public, perform notary public services within our country without the permission of our government or any government office, regardless of whether they have a notary public license. Although they are called notaries public, they are in reality representatives of foreign merchant insurance companies. Their judgments and estimations invariably favor the insurer, imposing compulsory measures and not allowing our Chinese people to intervene. Countless Chinese merchants have suffered as a result. There are even cases where accidents occurred several years ago, but foreign merchant notaries public have refused to pay compensation, citing non-compliance with the articles of association. A notary public has the nature of arbitration and exercises the power of appraisal, and must have the special permission of the state or government office. There is no reason why foreign merchants can arbitrarily exercise this authority within our country. Unfortunately, our country's previous administrative authorities did not examine this carefully and allowed foreign merchants to hold this position for decades. On the one hand, this was due to the lack of a Chinese organization for this business. Now that the period of political tutelage has begun and legal rights are being actively recovered, lawyers, accountants, and other professionals from foreign countries have been gradually restricted, but no measures have yet been taken to rectify this notary public function. Previously, this association, due to the fact that foreign merchant insurance companies often used biased notaries public to avoid paying insurance claims, notified all industries to no longer take out insurance with foreign merchant companies. This shows that the notary public function is closely related to the interests of all industries. Therefore, it is formally proposed at this congress that, in the future, when Chinese policyholders encounter accidents, regardless of whether the insurance company is Chinese or foreign, if a notary public is required for arbitration, it should be handled by a Chinese merchant notary public who has registered with the government. If the insurance company hires a foreign merchant notary public, the Chinese policyholder should refuse. This method can be requested to be stated on the insurance policy when it is issued. It is also requested that the Ministry of Industry issue a general order to all relevant government offices and commercial organizations to comply with this, and issue an order to the governments of all provinces and cities to order foreign merchant notaries public to cease their duties when they are exercising their functions within our country. Furthermore, our company organized the Yizhong Auction House in the 16th year of the Republic of China, concurrently operating a notary public business, being the sole pioneer of Chinese notaries public. We have already presented this to the former Shanghai Political Sub-Council, the National Registration Bureau, and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for registration and filing, to protect and promote it. We have also been appointed as appraisers by the Shanghai Local Court and the Shanghai Special District Court in various cases. All Chinese merchant insurance companies have our company handle their notary public affairs. Therefore, we request that the Ministry of Industry separately circulate for verification the information regarding our company's existing notary public status and history, so as to promote it, which would be extremely fortunate. According to current international practice, there are restrictions on foreigners holding public office in other countries, and Japan's prohibitions are even stricter, absolutely not allowing foreigners to hold such positions. Our country has treated this as an ordinary occupation in the commercial arena and has not paid attention, and without careful examination, the commercial losses have been enormous. In recent years, Chinese merchants have gradually learned to imitate this practice, but because foreign merchant insurance companies have a strong foundation and foreign merchant notaries public work in unison, they are still in their grasp. Unless the government clearly stipulates laws and regulations, implements registration methods, and establishes the principle that Chinese merchants should fill the position of notary public, it will be difficult to reverse the accumulated momentum. Based on the above reasons, it was resolved at the members' meeting of this association on June 27th to submit this request for review. We have prepared the documents and respectfully request that your Ministry examine and approve this, clearly stipulate the methods, and issue a general order to all provinces and cities to follow suit, which would be for the public good."</p>
<h3>Domestic Import and Export of Native Goods Exempt from Dredging Tax</h3>
<p>Loford, the Jianghai Customs Tax Officer, issued proclamation No. 1220 yesterday: "Regarding the proclamation: We have received an order from the Inspector General of Customs stating that all native goods imported from domestic ports and exported from this port to domestic ports will be exempt from the dredging tax from July 20th of this year. We must comply with this order. We hereby notify all merchants and people to be aware of this. This is hereby proclaimed."</p>
<h3>Liquor and Tobacco Industries Oppose Tax-Farming Conference</h3>
<p>▲ Two Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>The local public associations of Shanghai, including the distilleries, Shaoxing wine industry, local yellow wine industry, silk floss tobacco industry, Fenjiu wine industry, sauce garden industry, western tobacco industry, tobacco leaf industry, and dry tobacco industry, held an emergency meeting yesterday (the 19th) at the Fenjiu Wine Industry Association on Fangxie Road, Ximen, in Jiping Lane, regarding the practice of tax farming for liquor and tobacco licenses, private tax increases, violations of superior orders, and harassment of merchants and people. They resolved: (1) That each public association jointly request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the provincial bureau to abolish the tax farming system and private increases; (2) That each public association notify its members to submit their licenses to the association for consolidated payment, and designate the Fenjiu Wine Industry Association to draft and lead the effort, with each public association mutually electing one official to jointly take responsibility for the process, with the intention of continuing the action until the abolition is achieved.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Focuses on Industrial Standards</h3>
<p>▲ Letter from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>Yesterday, various trade associations received a letter from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce of the Ministry of Industry, stating: "We have received instructions from the Ministry of Industry, based on the resolution of the Industrial and Commercial Conference, regarding the industrial standards proposal, requesting that you properly stipulate the standards for raw materials and products in various industries and submit them to the Ministry for reference. Industrial standards are indeed an urgent matter for the country today. Chinese industry has traditionally been laissez-faire, without any standards. The same product has a diverse and inconsistent range of styles, and products of the same style vary in quality, with both perfections and flaws, leading to deception. As a result, buyers find it difficult to distinguish and disregard them, and manufacturers lament the difficulty of sales and the lack of business prosperity. Industrialized countries around the world have adopted certain standards for both raw materials and products. Chinese industry has always lagged behind, and if we do not make reasonable improvements, the future of industry is unthinkable. We hereby request your association to convene your industry peers to concretely discuss and stipulate simple standards for various items, such as quality, style, shape, width, and other aspects of products and raw materials, and send a reply to this bureau for verification and implementation, so that those seeking them can easily choose and promote consumption."</p>
<h3>Customs Collects Special Tax on Factory Silk</h3>
<p>▲ Non-Factory Silk is Generally Exempted</p>
<p>The General Affairs Office of the Jianghai Customs issued a public notice stating: "We have received an order from the Inspector General of Customs forwarding an order from the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance stating that a special tax of 30 yuan in national currency per picul should be levied on yellow and white silk transported from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to foreign countries, as previously announced by this customs. This special tax is approved to be collected on factory silk transported to foreign countries, and all other non-factory silk is generally exempted. We hereby notify all merchants to be aware of this."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Refund of Stamp Tax Fine</h3>
<p>▲ Fine for Unstamped Invoices Ten Years Ago</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, regarding the stamp tax bureau's fine for unstamped invoices from ten years ago, sent a special letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau the day before yesterday requesting a full refund of the fine. The original letter stated: "Rice shops have complained that Suilong and other rice shops have been fined by the stamp tax bureau for unstamped invoices from ten years ago. This association, after inquiring with your bureau, determined the annual inspection and punishment period. Subsequently, on the 3rd of this month, we approved your bureau's reply that the inspection would be held in the first half of this year, and the invoices and receipts used by the merchants would be limited. Any unstamped items found after January 1st of the 19th year should be detained and reported, and those before January 1st of the 19th year should be exempted. The rice shops claimed that the fines were all for old invoices, some dating back more than ten years, which sounds absurd. If they cannot provide factual evidence, it would be close to sensationalism. Even if the inspectors made a mistake, the case was reviewed, how could such an error occur? After forwarding this to the public association, we received a reply from the rice shop industry association on the 13th of this month, stating that the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau's reply stated that all cases to be fined are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, demonstrating the bureau's meticulousness. However, even the most careful can make mistakes. The association's previous claim that fines were levied on waste invoices from more than ten years ago is indeed based on facts and is not a fabrication. According to a letter from member Dexing Rice Shop, they were summoned and fined by the Public Security Bureau of the Second District, First Branch, for unstamped invoices from the Gengshen and Xinyou years. These waste invoices date back more than ten years and were fined 10 yuan. The Gengshen and Xinyou years' invoices were sent to the association for transfer and negotiation. The Gengshen and Xinyou years are indeed more than ten years ago. If there was no concrete evidence, the association would not have dared to make such an inquiry. We are now sending the original letter and the two Gengshen and Xinyou invoices and fine notice for your review. Please inform the bureau of the reason for the error in fining invoices from more than ten years ago, causing the association's members to suffer unnecessary losses. Please return the wrongly fined money in full to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Attached is a letter from the association with one invoice each from the Gengshen and Xinyou years and one fine notice. This fine notice was issued on May 20th of this year, and the unstamped invoices being fined are one from the Gengshen year and one from the Xinyou year. According to your bureau's reply, they occurred many years ago and are not subject to detention and fine. We are sending two invoices, the original fine notice, and the original letter for your review. Please approve the registration of the wrongly fined case and return the 10 yuan fine in full to comply with the limited detention and fine measures. We sincerely hope for your cooperation."</p>

<h3>Epidemic in the City Worsens</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the sultry and erratic weather, the epidemic has also become unpredictable. The number of patients at the Chinese Red Cross Society's Epidemic Hospital has suddenly increased, and the types of illnesses have also diversified. The day before yesterday, Zhang Suozi, the three-year-old son of Zhang Xibin, who resided at 22 Deming Lane, East Pushi Road, suddenly contracted pneumonia with a fever of over 104 degrees. He was sent to the hospital, where the attending director Dr. Wang Zhenchuan administered injections and other treatments, staying up all night. He only recovered yesterday evening. In addition, there are many cases of malaria, dysentery, and measles. Investigations show that the origin of these epidemics is mostly due to the infectious onset of food poisoning, which can be life-threatening in the shortest period of time. They should be sent to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. Methods such as pinching and scraping are most likely to cause delays. Citizens must pay attention.</p>
<h3>Meeting Record of the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association</h3>

<h3>Fire Insurance Pays Compensation with 10% Penalty</h3>
<p>The Zhenhua Grocery Store at No. 30 Jixiang Street, French Concession, caught fire and spread on the 10th of this month. The Fire Brigade rushed to extinguish the fire. The police station investigated and found that the store had fire insurance of 7,000 taels of silver. Therefore, they summoned the store to the French Court yesterday for questioning. First, the police chief reported the situation, and Chen Kangnian, the store manager, stated that it was indeed caused by a short circuit upstairs. The Chinese and Western judges ordered the defendant to pay compensation with a 10% penalty as a warning.</p>
<h3>Jieyan Medicine At Tisheng Hospital Is Efficacious</h3>
<p>Physician Feng Zhiyin, the director of the Tisheng Hospital on Guangxi Road, has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for many years. He is proficient in both internal and external medicine.

<h3>Tan Yunsan Donates Calligraphy to Relieve Guangdong Disaster</h3>
<p>Lingnan calligrapher Tan Yunsan, in view of the flooding in Guangdong Province, the material losses of which amount to tens of millions, and the 100,000 compatriots who are in danger and have nowhere to turn, and if they are not rescued quickly, 100,000 disaster victims will inevitably become starving corpses, has developed a compassionate heart and donated a thousand pieces of calligraphy, including couplets, hall hangings, plaques, signboards, folding fans, and calling cards. He will not charge for his calligraphy skills. For each piece, regardless of size, a fee of one yuan in silver will be collected in Shanghai, and one and a half yuan in foreign areas.

The funds raised from the calligraphy, after deducting 30% for the collection point and ink grinding fees, will be used to relieve the disaster. All people from all walks of life at home and abroad who wish to contribute to charity and obtain Tan Yunsan's calligraphy can submit their requests to Mr. Peng Yuzhi at the Taotao Restaurant on Dong Wuchang Road, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai, or to the Xiyin Study upstairs at 246 Xin Guangdong Street, Zhabei.</p>

<h3>Peaches from Renpu Orchard Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Although the Renpu Orchard in Hangzhou does not produce a large quantity of fruit, the high quality of its produce has long been renowned in Shanghai. The plum season is ending, and peaches have already arrived in Shanghai. Their fragrance is rich and extraordinary. It can be said that Mr. Lü Renfu devoted his life to achieving this effect. It is said that the four boxes that arrived yesterday sold out instantly. The distributor is located at No. 70 Xiangfen Lane, Zhejiang Road, and the selling price is 60 cents per pound.</p>
<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>▲ National Rubber Industry: The national rubber industry has seen increasing development in recent years. Recently, factories such as Da Zhonghua, Da Zhongguo, Guomin, and Guohua, in order to promote solidarity and welfare within the industry, initiated the establishment of the Shanghai National Rubber Products Industry Trade Association. This has already been approved by the Municipal Party Department for preparation. Xue Fuji, Yang Yongnian, Shi Zhishan, Mao Yuting, and Shen Mengshi have been selected as preparatory members. The preparatory office is located at No. 1107 Qunxian Fang, Avenue Edward VII. Many fellow tradesmen have been enthusiastically joining in recent days. It was decided at yesterday's preparatory meeting that the association would be officially established on August 1st. Currently, various procedures are being expedited.</p>
<p>▲ Candle Industry: The Candle Industry Trade Association previously announced and issued notices regarding the new standardized weights and measures, requesting all members to purchase and use them by a specific date. However, most members have been hesitant to act. The association issued another notice to fellow tradesmen yesterday, stating that they had received an order from the Social Affairs Bureau stating that the new standardized weights and measures in the city were about to be implemented, and the industry needed new equipment. Whether members or non-members, they should immediately submit orders to the Weights and Measures Testing Institute. As a result, the association sent a letter notifying everyone. However, a long time has passed, and many tradesmen have still not reported their orders. The association has now decided to set a deadline of the 26th of this month for reporting to the association for compilation and forwarding. If they continue to delay and observe, they will be punished if discovered in the future, and they will have only themselves to blame. The association will be unable to help. In addition to sending individual letters, this is a solemn notice.</p>

<p>▲ Jiangxi: The Jiangxi Native Place Association in Shanghai had previously scheduled to hold an election assembly on July 12th. However, due to the lack of enthusiastic participation from members, the date was changed. It is now heard that the association held the election assembly yesterday at 1:00 PM at the Jiangxi Assembly Hall in Xiaonanmen. Many members attended, creating a grand occasion.</p>
<p>▲ Xishan: More than 400 Xishan natives in Shanghai, including Xu Mingli, believe that the temporary executive committee of the Jinting Assembly Hall's plan to renovate the city houses outside the hall will result in a great loss of rights. They have been convening meetings of the fellow villagers association for days to discuss remedies. On one hand, they have hired a lawyer to publish a warning in the newspaper to the temporary executive committee of the assembly hall. They have also submitted a petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and convened a general meeting of fellow villagers for public discussion. The temporary executive committee of the Jinting Assembly Hall published a statement in the newspaper that was full of contradictions. The Xishan natives were furious after reading it and issued a collective rebuttal. The rebuttal roughly stated: "After reading the announcement of the temporary executive committee of the Jinting Assembly Hall, we can only laugh it off. The language is contradictory and the explanation is not coherent. The committee drafted a seven-year advance payment construction plan and distributed it to fellow villagers. Since the majority of fellow villagers responded with approval, why not implement it immediately? Instead, you are separately recruiting tenants for lease, without notifying fellow villagers again, and hurriedly signing contracts for lease and construction. Are you not trying to hide the truth from the eyes and ears of our fellow villagers? Moreover, the monthly rent is only 180 taels, which is intended to be used for accumulating grain funds, school subsidies, and the assembly hall's operating expenses. Even a clever woman would find this difficult. As for not requiring land certificate guarantees, why did the land certificate custodian, Sen Ji Yi, and others, publish an announcement stating that they would only be responsible for safekeeping until the end of July? If we do not oppose it soon, the sovereignty will be lost. In short, this is public property and must be agreed upon by the public. We will never allow it to be manipulated by a few people."</p>
<p>▲ Wuxi: The Wuxi Native Place Association in Shanghai held a joint meeting of directors and councilors yesterday afternoon at its clubhouse on Qipu Road to review the final accounts of revenue and expenditure for the 19th year, the new budget for the 20th year, and the four account books. Councilors Shi Fuhou, Zou Songdan, Wang Chuanbi, You Rongbo, and Li Dingfu were immediately appointed to review the accounts on a fixed date and report back to the general meeting. Subsequently, the meeting discussed ways to increase funding and decided to first strive to collect the new membership fees for the 20th year and collect the old membership fees. Finally, there was some discussion on association affairs, and the meeting adjourned after approving the academic report for the year.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial School Joint Conference Opposes He Lu as President of Anhui University</h3>
<p>▲ Lacking both talent and moral integrity | Using a general strike as a threat</p>
<p>(Anhui News) Since the Provincial Government appointed He Lu as the acting president of Anhui University, slogans and declarations to drive He out have appeared within the university. Anhui University is seen as a school prone to trouble, with almost no semester passing without disturbances. The background to these disturbances often originates from outside the university. On the 14th, the Anhui School Joint Conference resolved to oppose He's acting presidency and submitted a request to the Provincial Government to quickly appoint a formal president, and sent a letter to Anhui natives abroad expressing their opposition, and resolved that if the Provincial Government did not appoint another president by August 20th, all secondary schools would go on strike. The letter from the conference to Anhui natives abroad is recorded below: Anhui Provincial University has only been in operation for three years, and its foundation is not yet solid. Unless someone with outstanding talent, character, and experience takes charge, it will be impossible to develop it. He Lu's talent is not highly regarded in public opinion, and his personal conduct is not meticulous. Since the Provincial Government extended its invitation, public opinion has been in an uproar (omitted). Therefore, it was resolved that we are ashamed to associate with him, and we have separately presented a request to the Ministry of Education and the Provincial Government to appoint another formal president to take over the school. Gentlemen, you are respected elders of our hometown and models for the scholarly community. We hope that you will all advocate for this in order to value the education of our hometown.</p>
<h3>Guangxi University to Continue Operations</h3>
<p>Guangxi University has been closed for two years since it opened in 1928 due to political instability. However, as the highest institution of learning for fostering talent in Guangxi Province, it is highly anticipated for resumption for the sake of the general youth. It is heard that the university president, Dr. Ma Junwu, has received repeated telegrams urging him to return to Guangxi to plan for the restoration of everything. Mr. Ma has now returned to Shanghai and stated that the university is now working hard on repairs and construction. It is determined to continue operations next semester, initially enrolling approximately 500 students in the first, second, and third grades of the preparatory course. Next year, it will begin offering undergraduate courses in Arts, Sciences, and Engineering. In addition to recruiting students in Wuzhou, Liuzhou, Guilin, and Nanning in Guangxi Province, it is also recruiting at the High School Department of Great China University in Shanghai to facilitate enrollment for Guangxi students. The time is expected to be in early August.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Organizes Education Plan for Wu County</h3>
<p>The Wu County Education Bureau received an order from the Provincial Department yesterday, roughly stating: "According to the report and organization plan submitted by Yang Yuangui, the Provincial Department's local education administration inspection specialist, after inspecting the county, it was found that the county's education funds were approximately 90,000 yuan in deficit as of the end of the 19th fiscal year. If remedial measures are not taken quickly, bankruptcy will be inevitable. After reviewing the proposed reorganization plan, such as matching income and expenditure in the total budget, the various income items should be earnestly reorganized, the various expenditure items should be further tightened, and the unfunded items should be urgently raised to compensate for the new and old deficits and set up repayment plans. This is the most important part of the remedial policy and should be carefully considered and implemented by the Bureau Chief and the County Magistrate. The budget for the 20th fiscal year must be based on the total income of 629,806 yuan as originally planned. The various expenses must be clearly divided and compiled according to the available numbers, without any increases or decreases. All fixed temporary expenses, which are similar in nature to regular expenses, should be canceled. Substandard classes should be consolidated in accordance with the standards set by the Provincial Department. The establishment of social education institutions in the 20th year should be temporarily postponed, and attention should be paid to enriching the content of the existing institutions and improving their efficiency. The science laboratory should be handled by the Bureau Chief after careful discussion of the various items in the original plan and submitted for approval. Social education supervisors should be added immediately to take sole responsibility. The simplified elementary school system should be promoted in accordance with the actual needs of the county and the pilot area plan for compulsory education should be submitted for approval first. The central school system can be examined and handled in accordance with the general guidelines issued by the Provincial Department. The Bureau Chief is the person responsible for the implementation of the county's educational administrative staff. He must not avoid difficulties and must work hard to reorganize it so as to lay the foundation for permanent peace, which is what is hoped for. The Bureau Chief has been sincere in handling affairs in the past and will not be without merit in breaking down the old ways and reorganizing. He should continue to be encouraged to strive for efficiency and should not have any timidity. In addition to sending it separately, the original reorganization plan is copied in full for your compliance."</p>

<h3>Wuzhong's New Student Admissions to be Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>More than 600 students took the entrance exam for the current class of new students at the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School. The entrance examinations were held separately from the 15th to the 17th, with strict examination halls and close supervision. The teachers are now evaluating the test papers for each subject and assigning grades, which is a complicated process. The results will not be released today.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education Submits Results of Middle School Curriculum Provisional Standards Trial to the Ministry of Education (II)</h3>
<p>▲ Geography</p>
<p>| Second Operational Requirements</p>
<p>(1) Teaching methods should emphasize guiding students to fill out and draw various maps. "Reason" The most important thing in studying geography is to be familiar with the terrain. If students can be guided to fill out and draw maps, they can become familiar with the actual situation and develop the ability to draw maps readily.</p>
<p>(2) Teaching methods should pay attention to newspapers. "Reason" 1. There are many changes in geography, even in terms of place names, there are often changes, for example, Fengtian is now Shenyang, and Constantinople is now Istanbul. As for international relations and new material constructions in various countries around the world, they are changing rapidly, so special attention should be paid to newspapers. 2. If we can pay attention to newspapers, then new geographical materials can be obtained from the negotiations and wars caused by the recovery of the China Eastern Railway. If we can carefully read the geography of Manchuria to the three eastern provinces while studying the China Eastern Railway issue, we will gain even more.</p>
<p>| Fourth Teaching Material Outline |</p>
<p>(1) The teaching material outline is not connected with the time allocation and is too flexible. "Reason" The teaching material outline is not connected with the time allocation and is too flexible. Having a standard is equal to not having a standard.</p>
<p>(2) World Geography Teaching Material: In addition to focusing on the six countries that have the most relationship with China, it seems that attention should also be paid to small and weak nations. "Reason" 1. The Prime Minister once instructed us that to achieve China's freedom and equality, we must unite with the nations in the world that treat us equally and fight together, so all small and weak nations should be regarded as having the same relationship as the six countries and should be given attention. 2. The land of small and weak nations is mostly the colonies of imperialists. The independence of the colonies will further lead to the collapse of the imperialists, so paying attention to small and weak nations is also paying attention to countries such as Japan, the United States, Britain, and France.</p>
<p>▲ Arithmetic</p>
<p>| First Objectives |</p>
<p>(1) The objectives of high school arithmetic should be added to cultivate students' habit of calmly solving difficult problems, so that they will not be afraid of difficulties and will not be discouraged by failures. "Reason" In addition to striving for practicality, high school students learning arithmetic should cultivate their courage to struggle and the spirit to solve difficult problems, so that they can pursue advanced academics or strive to serve the society.</p>
<p>| Second Teaching Material Outline |</p>
<p>(1) In the high school arithmetic outline, under the item of equation groups in algebra (B), a general theorem and application of determinants should be added. "Reason" Determinants are a general method for solving general linear equations. They must be applied in analytic geometry and are widely used, so they should be taught.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the geometry D. Quadratic curves, it seems that they should be deleted and merged into analytic geometry. "Reason" It is not easy to understand quadratic curves in Euclidean geometry, and it takes a lot of time. It is quite suitable to teach them in analytic geometry. Otherwise, if quadratic curves are taught immediately after solid geometry, it will not only be unclear, but it will also repeat the disadvantage of analytic geometry.</p>
<p>| Third Time Allocation</p>
<p>(1) The time allocation for junior high school arithmetic should be changed to the table below.</p>
<p>First Year Second Year Third Year</p>
<p>Weekly Hours Weekly Hours Weekly Hours</p>
<p>First Semester Arithmetic 5 Algebra 5 Algebra 2 Geometry 3</p>
<p>Second Semester Arithmetic 5 Algebra 3 Geometry 2 Geometry 5</p>
<p>"Reason" Using subject-based mathematics and allocating time according to regulations, in the first semester of the first year, there are 5 hours of arithmetic and in the second semester, there are 2 hours of arithmetic and 3 hours of algebra. However, the materials for arithmetic must be connected with elementary school arithmetic and expanded, and application exercises related to the knowledge and experience of daily life, such as abacus, must be inserted. Since there are many materials and the students' level is one year short of that of elementary school students, the situation is different from the past. In the first and second semesters of the first year of junior high school, both should be changed to 5 hours of arithmetic, and the basic concepts of algebra, positive and negative numbers, and simple equations should be foreshadowed when teaching arithmetic to introduce the path of algebra, so that the foundation is more solid and there is no disadvantage of half-baked, miscellaneous, and unspecialized knowledge. Therefore, in the first semester of the second and third years, algebra will be taught exclusively, and in the third year, algebra and geometry will be taught in combination, and in the third year, geometry will be taught exclusively, and trigonometry is planned to be taught in high school.</p>
<p>(2) High school arithmetic should be 20 credits. "Reason" According to the general table, high school arithmetic has 19 credits, and according to the sub-table, it only has 18 credits, so it is known that there must be an error in the middle. However, according to the trial results of the affiliated schools for three semesters, it is always felt that there is not enough time to complete the teaching material outline in the curriculum standards as scheduled. It is planned to set it to 20 credits and add one credit to trigonometry in the fourth semester and reduce one credit to analytic geometry. In the fifth semester, analytic geometry is changed to four credits.</p>
<p>| Fourth Operational Requirements 1</p>
<p>(1) In the operational requirements of high school arithmetic, the actual application of trigonometric surveying of nearby school areas should be added. "Reason" Surveying directly applies trigonometry for the construction work during the period of political tutelage. Paying attention to surveying when learning trigonometry is directly to promote the application of theory and indirectly to cultivate the skills to engage in a profession.</p>
<p>▲ Physics and Chemistry</p>
<p>| Second Time Allocation</p>
<p>(1) Minerals and chemistry should be taught separately. "Reason" It is difficult to find teachers who can teach minerals attached to chemistry, so they should be taught separately. However, this kind of separate teaching must be carried out at the same time so that they can be connected with each other.</p>
<p>(2) The teaching procedure for high school physics, chemistry, and biology should be regulated. "Reason" The teaching procedure for the three items of high school physics, chemistry, and biology has not been regulated. According to the trial results, it is most appropriate to teach biology in high school year one, chemistry in high school year two, and physics in high school year three.</p>
<p>| Fifth Teaching Key Points |</p>
<p>(1) High school physics, A, Original text, (1) Every week, the last fifteen minutes of the one-hour lecture should be used for demonstration experiments. It should be changed to every time a unit is taught, the beginning or the last fifteen minutes should be used for demonstration experiments. "Reason" Based on the experimental results, the teaching materials for physics cannot be completely taught in one hour. Therefore, there cannot be different performances every hour, and the final performance can prove the correctness of the theory. Starting the performance can use curiosity to arouse research interest, both of which should be adopted separately. (2) High school physics original text, (3) One hour should be spent every week on questions and answers or exams. It should be changed to one hour should be spent after each chapter is taught on questions and answers or exams. (Reason) Only three hours are taught every week. If another hour is spent on exams and Q&amp;A, the lecture time will only be two hours per week. It is not only difficult to complete the prescribed teaching materials, but also there are too few exam materials, and it is difficult to get a systematic concept when held in fragments.</p>
<p>▲ Zoology and Botany</p>
<p>| First Time Allocation |</p>
<p>(1) Junior high school zoology and botany should be increased by at least one credit. "Reason" The original time allocation for junior high school botany and zoology was three credits each. After trying to teach according to the prescribed teaching material outline and teaching methods, I always felt that there was not enough time. If you want to reduce the teaching materials to fit the time, the prescribed teaching materials are very appropriate and should not be cut. Therefore, according to the experimental results, at least one credit should be added to each, that is, a total of eight credits. (End)</p>
<p>The decision on the results will be made tomorrow. It is feared that it will be difficult to recruit enough new students and a second entrance exam for new students will be held in mid-August.</p>

<h3>Shangda Takes Advantage of Running Team's Bitter Defeat by Four Points</h3>
<p>▲ 35 to 31</p>
<p>▲ No Games Tonight</p>
<p>The Japanese Indai Basketball Team played its third game in Shanghai last night and defeated the Running Team by four points, with a score of 35 to 31. The referee was Qu Hongren. Shangda is off today.</p>
<p>▲ Incomplete Team The Running Team's defeat was due to not having a fully prepared team. He Yanzhang drank too much ice water and could not perform at his best. Guan Yi and Wei Zuohan also went to Guangdong, so although their skills were high, their cooperation was slightly lacking. They lost by three points in the first half, 15 to 12, and the final result was a loss by four points.</p>
<p>▲ General Opinion The Shangda team has now been defeated by the Chinese team twice. Although their skills are higher, their team is not very complete, which has resulted in them not being able to cooperate fully. In future battles, they should send out the strongest and best troops to avoid the Japanese thinking that Chinese basketball in Shanghai is only so-so.</p>

<h3>Qingying Team Wins Two Games in Tianjin Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>▲ Lin Baohua Greatly Disappoints the Public</p>
<p>Tianjin, 18th The Japanese Keio University Tennis Team competed with Tianjin players at 4:00 PM on the 18th. The audience was more crowded than on the 17th and 9th. The weather was hot and sweat poured down like rain.</p>
<p>▲ Two Group Results</p>
<p>Ide (Japan) 7 to 5, 6 to 2 Da Lunqiang (Tianjin)</p>
<p>Yamagishi Shimura (Japan) 7 to 5, 6 to 1, 5 to 7, 7 to 5 Lin Baohua Wu Shaoxiang (Tianjin)</p>
<p>▲ Match Situation</p>
<p>In the singles match between Yamada of the Japanese team and Da Lunqiang of the Tianjin team, the first set was won by the Japanese team 7 to 5. Xiao Lunqiang was dizzy from the heat and rested for ten minutes before reluctantly competing. The result was still a loss of 6 to 2. In the doubles match between Yamagishi Shimura of the Japanese team and Lin Baohua and Wu Shaoxiang of the Tianjin team, the first set was 7 to 5, the second set was 6 to 1, and the third set was 7 to 5 due to the issue of honor and disgrace. The Tianjin team won. After resting for ten minutes, they fought again. Both sides gave their best, hoping to fight for the final victory. In the end, Lin and Wu were exhausted and lost many opportunities. The result was 7 to 5, and the Japanese team won. The match ended at 7:00 PM. Lin was quite famous in previous years, but in recent years he has been neglecting his training and his skills have declined. The audience was very disappointed in Lin.</p>
<h3>Davis Cup Finals: US Leads 2-1</h3>
<p>▲Doubles Victory Over Britain</p>
<p>丨Awaiting the Final Two Singles Matches丨</p>
<p>Paris, 18th – In the Davis Cup inter-zone final, the United States leads Britain 2-1. Today's doubles victory gives the US a one-point advantage. The outcome depends on the final two singles matches.</p>
<p>▲Doubles Match Results</p>
<p>Van Ryn and Lott (USA) defeated Hughes and Wheatley (GBR) 6-1, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3</p>
<p>▲Britain's Grim Situation</p>
<p>With each side winning one singles match on the first day, and the US winning the doubles today, the US now holds a 2-1 lead. The US only needs to win one of the final two singles matches to secure the challenge round right. Britain needs to win both, an unlikely prospect, as Austin has previously lost to Hoad, and Wheatley to Wood, at Wimbledon. Britain's hopes of retaining the Davis Cup are fading.</p>
<h3>Records of the Jiangnan Track and Field Team's Northern Expedition (3)</h3>
<p>丨Five Days in Tianjin丨</p>
<p>During their five days in Tianjin, the Jiangnan Track and Field Team was warmly welcomed by the Tianjin sports community and highly regarded by Mr. Zhang Boling. The team's activities in Tianjin are described below.</p>
<p>▲Good Weather Suddenly Returns</p>
<p>▲Day One: Continuous rain had left the field muddy and unsuitable for competition, leading to discussions among Tianjin sports officials about the team first traveling to Liaoning when they arrived last night. However, no decision was made. Unexpectedly, on the first morning, the weather dramatically improved, with sunshine streaming through the windows while the team members were still deep in slumber. The proposal to first go to Liaoning was therefore abandoned. Apart from a light workout at the Nankai Middle School sports field at 4 p.m. that afternoon, no other activities took place.</p>
<p>▲The Beautiful Scenery of Nankai</p>
<p>▲Day Two: At 9 a.m., Mr. Zhang Jiwu dispatched a representative to guide the entire team to visit Nankai University in Balitai. Balitai used to be a desolate area in the southern suburbs of Tianjin, overgrown with reeds and neglected. Now, thanks to Mr. Zhang Boling's tireless efforts, Nankai University has been built, including the Science Hall, Library, Showshan Hall, and dormitories for both male and female students, all completed one after another. It is not only the highest institution of learning in the North, but Balitai has also become the only famous scenic spot in Tianjin in less than ten years. The layout of Nankai University resembles a large park, with dense shade and a variety of flowers, creating a sense of contentment that makes one reluctant to leave. This contributes to the positive academic atmosphere at Nankai. The university is surrounded by rivers, making boating possible. In the eyes of Tianjin residents, it is akin to West Lake in Hangzhou or the Three Seas in Beijing. Every evening, one can find Chinese and foreign men and women boating for leisure, making it a key social venue in Tianjin. After touring the campus, the team members boarded four boats and cruised around the scenic spots. They then disembarked at Haiguang Temple and attended a luncheon hosted by the Tianjin Sports Association. During the luncheon, Mr. Zhang Jiwu, Chairman of the Tianjin Association, and Mr. Zhang Boling, Chairman of the National Sports Association, delivered speeches, emphasizing that the visit of the Jiangnan team was intended to promote track and field sports and inspire similar enthusiasm throughout the country. Finally, team leader Wang Fudan gave a speech of thanks, and the event concluded. At 4 p.m., the team conducted a formal practice session at Nankai Middle School, attended and photographed by reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Boling Hosts a Welcome Banquet</p>
<p>▲Day Three: Preparing for the competition against the Tianjin team tomorrow, the team rested completely. Team members were not allowed to leave. Mr. Zhang Boling personally hosted a luncheon to entertain the team.</p>
<p>▲Day Four: Starting at 4 p.m., the team competed against the Tianjin team. Detailed information has already been reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>▲Day Five: The team departed for Beijing on the 9 a.m. train.</p>
<h3>The Decline of the Honolulu Overseas Chinese Baseball Team, a Foundation of Chinese Baseball</h3>
<p>The Chinese people pay little attention to baseball, which leads to frequent failures in the Far Eastern Games. The Chinese expatriate community in Honolulu has extensively researched baseball techniques for over two decades. They have consistently maintained the Honolulu city championship, earning a well-deserved reputation in the Americas. At the 8th and 9th Far Eastern Games, Mr. Wang Zhengting, a pioneer in Chinese sports, specially recruited the team to represent the motherland. They secured second place in both Games, somewhat improving China's international standing in baseball. In 1928, the team defeated Keio University, the Japanese national champion, indicating their strength. In the last Far Eastern Games, the Japanese still feared the Honolulu team and lost to them despite fielding a national all-star team. However, the Honolulu team was stronger than any individual Japanese university team, as they could defeat Keio, Waseda, Meiji, and Hosei Universities, but slightly inferior to the Japanese national all-star team. However, the team members have aged, and their practice has become infrequent, leading to a significant decline in their skills. On the 12th of this month, the Meiji University baseball team from Japan traveled to Honolulu and held an international baseball match between China and Japan. Ten thousand spectators attended. After fierce fighting, the overseas Chinese team suffered a crushing defeat of 1-12. Meiji is not particularly strong, ranking fourth among Japanese universities. The defeat of the overseas Chinese team shows a significant decline, shaking the foundation of Chinese baseball.</p>

<h3>Finance: Highly Volatile Margin Trading Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Fluctuations Driven by German Debt News</p>
<p>Margin trading continued its upward trend last week, but with increased volatility and numerous twists. Daily fluctuations of over ten taels were common, hovering around 740 taels initially and later breaking through the 750 tael mark. The situation was complex and inconsistent, with market sentiment wavering due to conflicting news about German loans and financial instability. The start of rollover trading on the exchange, with September prices higher than August, led short sellers to cover. Initially at 5 qian, the premium later rose to over 3 taels, putting pressure on many. It is reported that Guangbang, Hengxing, and long-term spot trading firms have not completed their rollovers. From August 1st, the exchange will examine the goods received in July, currently estimated at around 30,000 bars. August margin contracts initially rose to 750 taels early in the week. On Thursday (the 16th, the rollover day), the low was 730 taels and 7 qian, closing at 740 taels, up 11 taels from the previous Saturday. September initially opened at 739 taels and a half, suddenly falling to 32 taels and a half, and reaching 54 taels towards the weekend, a difference of 22 taels and 4 qian, resulting in 47 taels. The combined August and September contracts (during this week) saw a net increase of about 14 taels after deducting over 3 taels for rollover costs. Overseas silver markets fell, and Shanghai exchange rates also weakened by one and a half grades. Bank transaction prices also tightened, with Chinese merchants occasionally covering shorts, reportedly still holding short positions. Hedging increased margin trading. Transactions by firms such as Dalianbang, Wanxing, Shunli, Tongtaichang, and speculator Mr. Wu have been mainly sales recently, although they remain long. Due to a major client's absence, transactions by Guangbang Hengxing and Shengda have been limited. Daily margin settlements, initially at 40 taels along the usual rate</p>
<p>, with a minimum of over 30 taels, and finally over 40 taels. Spot bars saw constant buying interest from Tianjinbang, but this decreased yesterday and the day before due to rumors of the firm suspending business. Prices for futures contracts rose by over 13 taels to over 11 taels. Until the German debt issue is resolved, margin trading is expected to undergo significant changes. The high and low prices of silver markets, exchange rates, and margin trading in the UK, US, and India during the week are detailed below.</p>

Large silver bars saw a rebound of 125, with near-term at 13 pence 25 and forward at 13 pence 0625. A telegram from New York stated that US silver prices also rebounded by 125, with spot at 28 cents. Private cables also increased by 125, with the market firm. The UK to US exchange rate fell by 3125 to 4 yuan 8 jiao 4 fen 5625. The US to UK exchange rate fell by 375 to 4 yuan 8 jiao 4 fen 6875.

The London to Shanghai shilling decreased by 0625 to 1 shilling 3 pence 375. Bombay spot increased by 1 anna to 44 rupees 01 anna, and forward also increased by 1 anna to 43 rupees 09 anna.</p>
<h3>Overnight Interest Slightly Higher on Sunday</h3>
<p>As it was Sunday yesterday, banks were closed as usual, leading to a shortage of funds and slightly higher overnight interest rates. The morning rate was 1 qian, and the afternoon rate was also 9 fen. Foreign interest rates remained at 7 qian 2 fen 2 li 3 hao 7 hu and a half in the morning, and increased by 1 hao 2 hu and a half in the afternoon to 7 qian 2 fen 5 li and a half, with transactions made. Morning transactions amounted to 835,000, and afternoon transactions amounted to 570,000. No transactions were made in banknotes in either session, either inside or outside the market. Qianzhuang foreign public bills were received at 3.78 million, silver public bills at over 35 million, and small qianzhuang transactions at over 300,000. Remittance collection from various routes amounted to over 400,000. Qianzhuang bill transactions totaled approximately 8 million in both sessions and small combinations. Jiangnan small silver was 6 qian 5 fen in both the morning and afternoon sessions, with transactions made only in the morning session for 3,000 jiao. Guangzhou silver was 6 qian 4 fen 2 li 3 hao 7 hu and a half in the morning and 3 li and a half in the afternoon, with transactions made for 70,050 jiao in the morning and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins remained unchanged at 379,500 wen.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Fell by Around 3 Yuan Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Erratic Fluctuations Throughout the Week</p>
<p>▲Transactions Reached Over 120 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The bond market in Shanghai last week saw extremely limited spot trading, with only 39,000 yuan traded throughout the week. 19 Customs bonds accounted for 13,000 yuan, with the remainder only in the thousands. The futures market remained active, with significant daily trading volumes in major bonds. Transactions reached 17 to 18 million yuan on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, and over 20 million yuan on other days. Total transactions for the week amounted to 122.2 million yuan, an increase of over 27.7 million yuan compared to the previous week. Although unified tax treasury bonds began trading on Wednesday, these bonds are still rarely traded, with only one transaction made for the July futures, and no transactions thereafter. 20-year Customs bonds were the most active, with transactions reaching 40.89 million yuan, followed by 20-year cigarette bonds at 22.23 million yuan, 19 Customs bonds at 14.43 million yuan, 9 Shan bonds at 12.955 million yuan, Disbandment bonds at 12.35 million yuan, and Reorganization bonds at 11.14 million yuan. Other bonds, such as Customs bonds at 2.325 million yuan, 96 bonds at 2.12 million yuan, 66 bonds at 1.715 million yuan, and 7-year bonds at 60,000 yuan, saw lesser activity. Unified tax bonds only traded 5,000 yuan. In terms of fluctuations, the market environment seemed less favorable than before due to slight changes in the political situation and rumors in the market. In addition, heavy selling by Northern firms created a weak market sentiment. Bond prices weakened early in the week, with 20 Customs bonds falling by 2 yuan, and 20 cigarette and 19 Shan bonds also falling by over 1 yuan. Tuesday saw a further decline of about 1 yuan. Wednesday saw cautious sentiment and the most stagnant prices. On Thursday, rumors of a military revolt in the Stone District triggered market panic, leading to heavy selling and sharp price declines, falling by as much as 2.5 to 3 yuan at the lowest point. On Friday, the market sentiment improved as the continuous decline had been excessive and the rumors proved to be unfounded. Investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, with strong demand. 19 Customs and 20 Customs bonds rebounded by 1.8 to 1.9 jiao, and Disbandment and Reorganization bonds also saw significant gains. On the final day of the week, the trend became more peaceful, with only 20 cigarette bonds falling by 1 yuan. Other price movements were minimal. Overall, prices fell by about 2 to 3 yuan compared to the previous week, with only 7-year and 66 bonds remaining relatively stable. The bond market appeared chaotic. The statistics of high and low prices and fluctuations are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Sharp Price Increases in the Yarn Market Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Slight Retreat at the Weekend, Still Up by Two Taels</p>
<p>▲Spot Yarn in High Demand, Particularly for Northern Sales</p>
<p>Yarn prices rose sharply early last week, showing a trend of increasing prices. The boycott movement intensified, drawing in speculators. Buyers flocked to the market, and firms increased purchases in anticipation of future needs. Tianjin firms actively procured spot goods for inland regions, further fueling the market. Prices for yarn contracts surged, with an increase of about 4 taels on Tuesday. However, the market eased slightly after one merchant unexpectedly sold without price limits. Overseas yarn and cotton markets were calm, and gold prices remained stable. Towards the weekend, continuous selling by major players caused prices to retreat slightly. However, yarn contract prices were still up by two taels compared to the previous week. Total transactions for the week amounted to 341,800 bales. Spot yarn sales were brisk, particularly for northern markets, with 16, 14, and 20-count spot yarn being particularly tight. Market sentiment remained strong. Firms purchased a total of 20,665 bales throughout the week, with traders buying 4,100 bales. The highest purchase volumes by firm are listed below:</p>
<p>Firm Bales Firm Bales Firm Bales Firm Bales</p>
<p>Hankou 1,100 Qingdao 125 Northern 780 Guangdong 2,910</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Lackluster Last Week</h3>
<p>▲Difficult Situation for Both Bulls and Bears</p>
<p>▲Spot Cotton Virtually Stalled</p>
<p>The cotton market has been uninspired for the past week, tending toward a stagnant situation. Overseas cotton markets have also been indecisive, and although exchange rates have risen, domestic concerns about floods and damage to cotton crops in Shaanxi initially boosted sentiment. However, the weather soon cleared, and the lackluster performance of US cotton markets further dampened market enthusiasm. Spot cotton sales have been sluggish, with mills showing no purchasing interest. This has resulted in a difficult situation for both bulls and bears. Japanese firms continue to absorb forward positions, with significant volume. Cotton market movements will depend on the conditions of new cotton and US cotton. Prices for contract and old cotton have weakened due to a shortage of buyers. New cotton prices, held firm by Japanese firms, were slightly higher. Overall, prices for each month were close to the previous week, with a slight increase of 2.3 qian. Transactions totaled 258,900 dan. The source of cotton was 3,650 bales of Yao cotton, with US cotton volumes similar to the previous week.</p>

<h3>Fluctuating Conditions for Foreign Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton prices initially strengthened due to favorable news from Liverpool, then weakened due to selling on Wall Street, and finally strengthened again due to buying by traders. Futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 4 points. Spot prices remained unchanged. UK cotton futures rose by 2 points, while spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton prices saw short covering and buying by brokers, with Bengal unchanged, Oomra falling by 0.115 rupees, and Broach rising by 1 rupee.

<h3>Grains: Prices Softening in the Hexia Rice Market</h3>
<p>▲Xin Zha: Few traders were present at the market this morning. Su-Chang premium grades and Zhongguan grades declined by 2 jiao. Kunshan and Jiangyin white rice were losing ground, with prices softening by 1-2 jiao. Purchases of Nanbang, Shipu, Chonggu, Hangchuan, and Xitang late rice were weak, with remaining stocks plentiful, prices declining about 1 chi. Lu-bu sharp rice sales were poor, with flat conditions. Glutinous rice saw no demand from wineries, with prices continuing to fall. Although some early rice had arrived at the docks, volumes were extremely low, with prices remaining at original levels. 20-30 boats from the West Road brought approximately 2,000 dan.</p>
<p>▲Nanjing: Supplies from various regions were still plentiful, approximately 10 boats. Sales in urban and rural areas were sluggish. Thick glutinous rice and second-grade rice declined by 2 jiao, with extremely quiet trading and bearish sentiment. Customer sentiment was affected. Although the arrival of thin rice was low, sales were slow, and prices also fell by 1-2 jiao. Foreign Lu-bu sharp rice was stagnant, with prices declining. General conditions were weak, with prices declining both overtly and covertly. Early rice was sold as it arrived, with prices unchanged. A telegram from Annam stated that 100,000 bags of foreign rice would be imported within a week, causing rice prices in Shanghai to steadily decline.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Harvesting Mostly Stopped in Wuyuan Zi Tea Region</h3>
<p>Wuyuan Zi Tea output has been very plentiful this year. Competition among tea firms drove prices up, leading farmers to harvest and process as much as possible, hoping to meet the demand. However, news of falling green tea prices in Shanghai soon spread, and firms lost interest. Cautious firms, even if they had not filled their quotas, were reluctant to buy more, causing prices to fall. Farmers in the northern mountainous regions, where tea output is highest, have stopped harvesting due to low prices and limited sales. However, Wudong Zi Tea continues to be harvested and sold, as demand from firms in the eastern regions remains strong, with prices hovering between 60 and 65 yuan, without declining.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Seed Tea Merchants Need Much</h3>
<p>Due to insect damage to the spring tea in Tunxi this year, the tea production in Shexian County suffered a reduction. Most merchants did not meet their purchase quotas. Everyone hopes for a bumper harvest of seed tea to make up for the shortfall. Therefore, as soon as the seed tea came onto the market, the merchants rushed to buy it as much as possible. Furthermore, the superior Zhenmei tea was transported to Shanghai, as the first Tunxi tea to arrive would fetch the highest price, making the merchants even more enthusiastic. Recently, tea merchants in Tunxi opened their price lists for lower-quality stored tea, with prices still around fifty or sixty yuan. There is a high demand for seed tea leaves of fine and tender quality, with asking prices remaining at sixty to seventy yuan. Many tea merchants are collecting from tea farms and rushing to Tunxi to sell. However, in recent days, the supply from the tea-growing areas has been gradually decreasing, and the quality of the leaves is deteriorating daily, with most tea farmers ceasing picking. It is said that the seed tea market will not last much longer.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Plummets Due to Boycott</h3>
<p>▲Coarse Granulated White Sugar Increases by Half a Penny and is Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the guild’s listed price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar (Dutch sugar) was well-received. The opening price was 11 taels and 4 qian. Fine granulated white sugar was 11 taels and 4 qian and a half. Later, coarse granulated white sugar rose to 11 taels and 4 qian and a half. The market was quite lively. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 11 taels, and slightly lower quality was 10 taels and 9 qian, with a bullish trend. Taikoo’s cube sugar B mark was 12 taels, CW mark was 11 taels and 8 qian, and HM mark was 11 taels and 3 qian. There was an extreme shortage of goods leaving warehouses, and the market was very lively. Wah Shun Company offered 1,000 bags of B mark at 12 taels, and also sold several hundred bags of coarse granulated white sugar at 11 taels and 4 qian. As Ningbo telegraphed that Japanese sugar shipments had stopped, and Shanghai was intensifying its economic severance with Japan, market sentiment weakened, and more goods were leaving warehouses. Buyers, anticipating potential issues with transportation and delivery, mostly took a wait-and-see approach, leading to sluggish transactions and a slight market decline. N mark was priced from 11 taels, 2 qian to 1 qian and 7.5 fen, SH mark was 11 taels and 0 qian and 7.5 fen, T mark was 11 taels, 6 qian and 2.5 fen to 6 qian, YT mark was 11 taels and 1 qian and a half, YRO mark was 11 taels and 0 qian and 5 fen, YP mark was 11 taels and 5 qian and a half, TK mark was 11 taels, 2 qian and a half to 2 qian, TM mark was 11 taels, 1 qian and a half to 1 qian, showing a weakening trend. The firm Zhen Xiang offered 2,000 bags of spot Hong Kong coarse granulated white sugar at 11 taels, 4 qian, and 2.5 fen per yuan, to be cleared in four days. The trade was very interested and the market extremely lively, with a strong upward trend.</p>
<h3>Metals: Qingdao Merchants Buying Up 7.5-li Steel Plates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Qingdao merchants suddenly started buying up 7.5-li English steel plates, purchasing seven or eight hundred pieces. The market price was 6 taels and 5 qian per case, an increase of 1 qian and a half from before.</p>
<h3>Tinplate from the East Rises Due to Boycott</h3>
<p>Since the Wanbaoshan Incident, local merchants have been extremely indignant, leading to discussions of boycotting goods from the East, including tinplate, new lead wire, nails, coal shovels, and other items. However, the market price suddenly rose yesterday. Speculation points to hoarding by a small number of merchants. For example, 3'7" tinplate rose to 1 tael, 2 qian and 6 fen, and 3'6" tinplate rose to 1 tael and 3 fen, an increase of more than 3 fen from before. Nails and lead wire also increased by 3 to 4 qian each. Only merchants from areas along the Yangtze River were buying, with other merchants purchasing very little.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Zhongxing Vegetables and Jinshan Branches Arrive Fresh</h3>
<p>▲Price 19.5 Taels ▲68.5 Taels</p>
<p>The first batch of new Zhongxing vegetables arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling 391 packages, all independently sourced by various merchants. Samples were immediately displayed. Due to rain in the production area, the color was slightly inferior. Merchants from various regions inquired about purchases, with Guangdong merchants making the most transactions, at a price of 19 taels and a half. Approximately half has already been sold. If the arriving goods were dry and bright yellow, the selling price could have been higher. Unfortunately, the inferior color due to rain prevented a lively market. However, it is expected that they will be sold out by Monday.</p>
<p>Genuine new Jinshan branches arrived at a northern merchant's house yesterday, with 20 cases of Liansheng brand. The quality was mediocre. However, the weight was only about seven or eight piculs, so the asking price reached 68 taels and a half, more than 20 taels higher than old stock. Although this year's harvest is poor, the market price is too high, reducing consumption. Whether the market can stabilize in the future depends on sales.</p>

<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Seventeen-Year-Old Hen that Lays Eggs</p>
<p>In Skipton, Yorkshire, England, there is an old hen that has broken the world record for egg-laying. It has been laying eggs for seventeen years since it came into the world. Therefore, everyone calls it "Old Lady." "Old Lady" is extremely fertile and has been laying eggs for seventeen years without fail. When its owner brought it home eleven years ago, he did not expect it to lay eggs, only wanting it to sit on duck eggs to hatch ducklings. Who knew that after the ducklings were born and went into the water, it would start laying eggs itself. Since then, it has been laying eggs every year from mid-April, always for six or seven weeks continuously, then resting slightly before continuing to lay eggs for another six or seven weeks. It is said that during its busy period, it lays an average of three eggs per week. If calculated over seventeen years, the number is quite considerable.</p>
<p>Special Treatment for Insomnia</p>
<p>A special method for treating insomnia has recently been invented by P. Boyd, a British genealogy expert. He is a member of the Genealogical Society. Some time ago, he suffered from insomnia, feeling mentally exhausted and in great pain. On the other hand, he began to compile a table of marriage names and detailed explanations from England and Wales between 1538 and 1837. He has already compiled 1.4 million entries in 139 volumes. No matter whose wedding date it is, it can be investigated clearly in just five minutes. He has to refer to no less than thousands of records, some of which are difficult to read due to their age. Every day, the incoming mail is also endless, supplementing and adding information, which is very troublesome. Boyd himself thinks that this work cannot be completed in less than a hundred years. Because it is too troublesome, he immediately became sleepy. As a result, his insomnia was completely cured.</p>
<h3>Nuns of Nanxun</h3>
<p>— A Xiang</p>
<p>Nanxun, a major town in western Zhejiang, has many nuns. Gentle and charming, their fame spreads throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. There is much charm and interest in them. I will record some of it to serve as a page in the scandalous history of the Buddhist gate.</p>
<p>The best among them is Doumu Convent, located near the Nanxun Rainbow Bridge. The women there are known for their beauty and youth. In the past, the New Stage Theater once produced a play about it called "Doumu Convent." Someone was secretly sent to Nanxun, and the convent head was bribed with a large sum of money to lead the nuns to Shanghai to show their beauty on the stage. Just as their charms were about to be revealed, they were stopped by powerful forces, and it did not happen.</p>
<p>There is an event similar to "The Jade Dragonfly." It is said that a certain civilian from out of town accidentally entered a small convent in the western region. He mistakenly entered paradise, delighting the nuns. He engaged in tantric practices within the Buddhist texts. The man was not made of indestructible vajra. In less than a month, Shen Guisheng was consulted about him in the underworld. This tale of grief and charm is still used as conversation material.</p>
<p>Many Nanxun nuns keep their hair long, wearing new styles of chignons like ordinary women. In the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), a certain old youth, angered by their lack of nun-like or lay-like behavior and their shameful unseemliness, gathered some like-minded people and sharpened their scissors, intending to shave their heads and make them all bare like Niu Mountain, to distinguish them from ordinary people. When the nuns heard the news, they were unwilling to sacrifice their black hair to the sharp blades of Bingzhou. For a time, it was chaos, with nuns escaping over the walls like butterflies and red apricots. Those who had protectors sought refuge under their protection, while others simply left the convent and went down the mountain to become courtesans. Due to this incident, the nuns of Nanxun declined slightly. Previously, an article in this journal by Mr. Chi Fo stated that the nuns of Nanxun were mostly young and beautiful, suitable for offering wine and captivating souls. This was three or five years ago. Now, the convent is still there, but the people are different. Those who open the door to receive guests are mostly old with wrinkled skin and white hair. If Mr. Liu visits again, he will be filled with emotion at the changes.</p>
<h3>New Uses for Talking Pictures</h3>
<p>— Geng Xin</p>
<p>Since the prevalence of talking pictures, not only are the figures in the play portrayed visually, but also audibly. When we are in the theater, it is as if we are talking in the same room with the people in the film. Recently, it was heard that the Illinois Supreme Court in the United States is considering using talking pictures to try cases. This has been submitted to the local bar association for consideration. According to Mr. Li, the president of a certain law school in Chicago, the court should use the new contributions of modern science to seek perfection in the performance of its duties. Using talking pictures to try cases can preserve the voices, appearances, attitudes, and actions of both parties and witnesses when they give their testimony without missing any details. Compared to only using printed or written records, it is naturally easier to achieve the goal of fairness.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Bountiful Birthday Banquet</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jue</p>
<p>The famous Sichuan painter Zhang Shanzi celebrated his fiftieth birthday with a banquet at Tao Le Chun. Over a hundred members of the Shanghai press, literary figures, and artists attended, enjoying music, wine, and elegant attire. I was fortunate enough to attend this grand event. I will record what I saw and heard, though the event may be past, I will still gather the fragrant grasses from the horizon.</p>
<p>▲Zeng Nongran's Painting of Pine Trees There were many paintings presented for his birthday on the walls, such as Wang Yiting's portrait of Shanzi, Xie Gongzhan's seasonal flowers, He Tianjian's ink landscape, Ma Wanli's pine tree, a collaborative painting of pine and crane by Ye Weishen, Zhang Yuguang, Wang Zhongshan, Gao Shangzhi, and others, Wu Yifeng's blue-green landscape, Xiong Songquan's pine monkey, and Cai Yimin's bamboo, all selections of the time. However, Zeng Nong Lao's ink pine tree was the most unique and clever. This painting by Nong Lao was created in the year of Yichou. The sparse, short pine tree is extremely crooked and proud. The inscription reads, "Zhang Dafeng's wrist moves like clouds and shakes feathers in the sky, closely resembling Lao Ran." With a smile, "In the fifth month of Yichou, the heat was unbearable and I couldn't sleep. I got up at night to create this." Nong Lao passed away, and this painting was treasured by his family. This time, Madame Zeng specially gifted it to Shanzi as a song of pine and cypress from a disciple. Shanzi calls his studio Dafengtang, and the inscription mentions Zhang Dafeng. Shanzi's birthday is in the fifth month, and this painting was also created in the fifth month. As if there were a predestined relationship with Zhang, the style and meaning of the master's school and the karmic connection with brush and ink make it a treasure indeed.</p>
<p>▲Gift of Painted Fans During the banquet, silk fans were given as souvenirs. One side of the fan featured a printed image of Shanzi's tiger painting, with grass and bamboo added and colored by Daqian. The other side featured Mr. Wenxiu, Shanzi's fourth younger brother, handwritten two chapters of Shanzi's self-descriptive poem for his fiftieth birthday. The calligraphy was exquisite and elegant. The poem and painting were a perfect match. The guests could carry them in their sleeves, embracing the style of Dafengtang and enjoying themselves immensely.</p>
<p>▲Harmonious Poems Many poems were written in response to Shanzi's two self-descriptive poems, filling the walls with beautiful verses. Wei Ruosou's rhyming and Wang Menggong's rhyming collection of sentences were particularly excellent. Wei's poem says: "Both are wanderers, living by the seaside. Forget distinctions, see poverty. Black and white eyebrows are similar, the body is pure in painting. The moss and lichen now agree, and I have long respected your kinship. The spirit of the tiger is fierce, in the vast valleys. Wonderful in the place of clear history, revealing the leisure of an official. Painting on reeds inherits the jade room, the hibiscus supports the island mountain. A song of pine and cypress, I cannot delete it." Wang's poem says: "When the sea flows horizontally, I move my home near the sea. Friends are many and good, laughter can cure poverty. You excel in painting in poetry, I am ashamed that my learning is not pure. Climbing the hall to celebrate your birthday today, colorful clothes are peaceful and intimate. The belly contains a thousand years of achievements, leisurely between heaven and earth. Talent is high and far from the vulgar, ambition is great and cannot be stopped. Yi Yi is famous in the world, I think of buying a mountain. Writing books to enjoy the years, do not lightly delete the world." Wang's poem is a collection of sentences, but it is completed in one breath, seamless. As the ancients said, "Literature is born from heaven, and wonderful hands obtain it by chance."</p>
<h3>Random Musings on Korea (10)</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>After a week in Seoul, I headed to Pyongyang, the former capital of Korea and now the second-largest commercial port on the peninsula. (Note: This was the place where the anti-Chinese riots by Japanese and Korean vagrants were most violent, and where Chinese compatriots suffered the most deaths and injuries.) There were twelve of us traveling together, the renowned Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team on a tour of the East. Unexpectedly, there were over two thousand compatriots waiting to greet us at the station. They each held the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Crimson Ground, shouting "Long live the Republic of China" three times. This enthusiastic and sincere display of emotion made us truly "feel overwhelmed by favor." Moreover, besides the Chinese merchants, most of them were strong and sturdy farmers and laborers in short shirts and bare feet, their faces filled with joy. No wonder the Japanese and Koreans were also gathered in crowds to witness this unprecedented grand event of Chinese people. In the evening, they gathered again at the Zhonghua Building for a welcome party. It is said that this was the first meeting between the Korean Chinese community and the domestic sports circles. They hoped that athletic groups would come to Korea often to bring them honor and that Chinese planes and warships would come to console them and fight for the dignity of the Chinese. They reported the suffering they had endured in Korea, word by word, expressing a united desire and fervent hope for the unification and strengthening of the motherland. That the laboring class could awaken on their own is indeed a very good sign.</p>
<p>Pyongyang is the battlefield of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. There are many historical sites, such as Xuanwu Gate, Mudan Terrace, Choisung Terrace, Eulmil Terrace, and the historically significant Tomb of Gija. After paying our respects, we were awakened with a jolt, filled with the poignant feeling of "it's unbearable to look back on those years." During the Sino-Japanese War, our army defended the west of the Daedong River, while the Japanese army concentrated on the east. The two armies confronted each other. Qing General Zuo Baogui was trapped in Xuanwu Gate. Japanese General Harada Jūkichi led sixteen elite soldiers to attack at midnight, breaching our defenses. As a result, the entire army retreated in disarray towards Andong. With the loss of Pyongyang, our army's base in Korea was completely plundered by the enemy. Mudan Terrace is on the summit of a mountain. The remains of the strong fortifications built by our army still exist. Choisung Terrace was originally called Oseung Terrace. It was renamed after Japan annexed Korea to signify the glory of their victory. A wooden sign stands a few steps in front of the terrace, depicting the battle formation and marking the routes of the Japanese Asaning Detachment and Wonsan Detachment's sneak attacks on our army's first to fifth fortresses. Eulmil Terrace was originally guarded by our General Ma Yukun. He retreated after the Xuanwu Gate was breached. Ancient trees nearby reach the sky. Looking at the bullet holes on the trees, dense as a honeycomb, one can imagine the intensity of the battle between the two armies thirty-six years ago. Various steles and plaques have all been changed from Chinese to Japanese to highlight their glory and expose our national humiliation. Seeing this, those with a conscience feel even more disheartened and heartbroken. The Tomb of Gija is where Gija of Zhou was enfeoffed in Korea and later buried. Recalling Gija's achievements three thousand years ago, how can we comfort his heroic spirit? This proves the long and profound historical relationship between China and Korea. And now, we allow those dwarfish slaves to run rampant. Floating on the Daedong River, we can only hear the "hatred of a lost nation."</p>
<p>In short, Japan's ambition to plot against us is a consistent action from top to bottom. Our four hundred million compatriots should also be awakened. Regarding the tragic anti-Chinese incident in Korea, we have always believed that the Koreans were acting under duress and are not our negotiating counterparts. However, we must not forgive Japan's premeditated conspiracy. We pledge to support the government as a backing, conducting serious negotiations. Our minimum demands are: (1) Strictly punish the instigators of the anti-Chinese riots by Japanese and Korean vagrants. (2) Compensate all losses suffered by Chinese immigrants. (3) Provide relief to the deceased and injured Chinese immigrants. (4) The Japanese government issues a written apology to the Chinese government. (5) Guarantee that the same incident will never happen again. Until the negotiations achieve their goals, the whole nation must unite with a resolute and courageous spirit to permanently sever economic ties with Japan. I believe that if we persist in this effective boycott for more than six months, Japan will definitely soften.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to inform the readers that this article was originally part of my "Scraps from a Trip to the East." Written in a rambling manner, it is published here first. The motivation is entirely driven by righteous indignation over the Korean incident. I hope readers will forgive any errors. (The End)</p>

<h3>??? (27)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Zi Liang looked in the direction she pointed and saw a white voile long gown hanging on the coat rack. He quickly grabbed the sleeve and asked her,</p>
<p>"Is it this?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Don't go near it, I'm terrified."</p>
<p>As she spoke, she covered her eyes with both hands, not daring to look. Zi Liang quickly took down the gown and tossed it into the closet.</p>
<p>"Look! The ghost has been banished!"</p>
<p>The woman took her hands away from her eyes, still screaming in fright,</p>
<p>"There's still a big head!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! That's my straw hat!"</p>
<p>Saying that, he took down the straw hat, wanting to take it to her to see, but she was too scared to look. Zi Liang tapped the top of the hat with his finger. Hearing the sound, she finally believed him and dared to take a closer look at the hat.</p>
<p>"Where's the white ghost?"</p>
<p>"That was a white long gown!"</p>
<p>The woman heard this, half believing, half doubting. However, Zi Liang dared not take out the gown again and hang it on the coat rack for her to see. While she was still unsettled, the nanny had already brought up the congee and side dishes for the woman to eat. She held a plate and walked to the bed, looking for a place to put it.</p>
<p>"I'm not getting up. Put the plate on the edge of the bed!"</p>
<p>The nanny placed the plate. The woman used her chopsticks to taste the side dishes first. The nanny turned to look at Zi Liang,</p>
<p>"It's dark now. Go downstairs and eat!"</p>
<p>Zi Liang was about to go down when he looked at the woman.</p>
<p>"I can't leave!"</p>
<p>Zi Liang stopped in his tracks.</p>
<p>"If you leave, I'll be scared again."</p>
<p>"I haven't had dinner yet!"</p>
<p>"Why don't you keep me company and eat congee with me?"</p>

<p>Youth Corner</p>
<h3>Dean of Discipline</h3>
<p>— San Mu</p>
<p>Our school's Dean of Discipline, Mr. Xi, is a student from a certain university. He seems to be about twenty-five or twenty-six years old. His face is dark with a hint of yellow, and his eyes are always tired. He wears a set of yam-colored Western-style clothes. He teaches Party Principles in our class. Whenever he enters the classroom, the students' spirits are immediately lifted, because after taking attendance, he doesn't teach from the book. First, he talks about the problems of youth's depression, then he rambles on about free love. Finally, he tells the students, "If you have any personal problems, feel free to talk to me individually. I will definitely point you to a way out. Don't think that just because I am a man, you shouldn't be embarrassed to talk…"</p>
<p>The classroom is as noisy as a restaurant. Everyone is talking to each other.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xi must be heartbroken."</p>
<p>"No, he has a mental illness. Don't you see that he always speaks incoherently? I heard that his wife is too unfashionable, and he often gets angry at her, so he is now mentally unstable…"</p>
<p>"Every time he complains to us, he is hinting at Ah Huan (a classmate). Don't you see that he is secretly looking at her with his eyes…"</p>
<p>Time passes quickly. Mr. Xi hasn't even started lecturing about the book.</p>
<p>The ringing of the bell vibrates in everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>Half a year of Party Principles class has been spent in tasteless conversation. Two weeks before the summer vacation, Mr. Xi saw that only five pages of the textbook had been taught, and he began to panic. When he came to class, he didn't even take attendance. He opened the book and read like a machine gun. He had to read at least ten pages before putting down the book and lecturing,</p>
<p>"In recent years, China has been oppressed by imperialism, so the late Premier created the Three Principles of the People to overthrow imperialism."</p>
<p>"Imperialism uses despotic means to oppress weak nations."</p>
<p>"Our nation is like a heap of loose sand, lacking a spirit of unity, so it is most easily invaded by imperialism. We young people must unite to overthrow imperialism. At the same time, to realize the Three Principles of the People, we must first overthrow imperialism…"</p>
<p>"Ah, how can you be sleeping…" Mr. Xi was lecturing enthusiastically when he suddenly felt that the classroom was too quiet. He happened to look down and saw several students slumped on their desks.</p>
<p>"Fine, I put in so much effort to lecture you, but you don't listen attentively. I'm not happy to lecture anymore."</p>
<p>"No, teacher, please lecture. We are listening very attentively."</p>
<p>"Teacher, you are really suffering too much. You should rest a bit in this hot weather. Anyway, class is about to end. There's no need to lecture."</p>
<p>"No, this is not right. This little book hasn't been finished in half a year. I feel very sorry to all of you. Now I want to work hard to make up for your Party Principles." After saying a few words of repentance, Mr. Xi cleared his throat again,</p>
<p>"From what has been said above, we can know that the only task of the Kuomintang now is to overthrow imperialism."</p>
<p>"If you don't have a book, you can share one with someone else." Mr. Xi noticed at a glance that there was no book on Hen's desk.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, teacher. Everything you say, I can remember in my heart. The book is too brief. It doesn't have as much about overthrowing imperialism as you lecture."</p>
<p>Mr. Xi was silent. The whole class burst into laughter.</p>
<p>One day, the weather was very hot. After Mr. Xi finished reading five pages, beads of sweat the size of beans couldn't help but fall. While reaching into his pants pocket with his right hand to take out a handkerchief, he walked to the door to close the classroom door.</p>
<p>"Teacher, what's the reason? It's so hot, why are you closing the door?" The students asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"I want to take off my coat. I'm afraid it would be unsightly for outsiders to see." As he said this, he took it off.</p>
<p>"Teacher, you are too selfish, harming everyone for your own benefit, making us hot."</p>
<p>"You are hot, but it's better than me. My clothes are made of thick wool."</p>
<p>"Then why did teacher have to wear a suit?"</p>
<p>"Wearing a suit has two advantages. First, it's convenient for walking and getting on the tram. Second, it easily shows the spirit of youth."</p>
<p>"Isn't wearing a Zhongshan suit the same?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I heard that teacher is still a member of the party. He should wear a Zhongshan suit even more, to show off his spirit and go overthrow imperialism."</p>
<p>Hahaha—echoed with a burst of laughter. Mr. Xi played deaf and dumb.</p>
<p>Once, Ni lost fifty yuan from her suitcase. When Mr. Xi heard about it, he immediately flew to the dormitory to search.</p>
<p>"How can a male teacher search a female student's dormitory? Isn't there a female disciplinarian?" A hot-blooded student was a little angry when she saw Mr. Xi's playful attitude.</p>
<p>"Whoever opposes, is a suspect."</p>
<p>"If you don't allow opposition, then you have to do it properly. Could it be that fifty yuan can fit in a small powder box?" Originally, Mr. Xi was too inappropriate. He couldn't bear to let go of every item of the female students, so it's no wonder he provoked them to say this to him.</p>
<p>The class bell rang. The fifty yuan had not been found, so they had to go to class temporarily.</p>
<p>"It is most unfortunate that a theft occurred at the school. Today's incident has been searched for half a day without any results. The dean of studies and the principal are unwilling to help at all, saying to leave it to me to handle. I think all of you are high school students, and your character must be very cultivated. Of course, you would not do such a thing, so I would like to discuss with you about the solution to this matter. Do you have any good methods?"</p>
<p>"What good methods do we have? This matter is of course the responsibility of the disciplinarian." The student who opposed the male teacher searching the dormitory was retaliating.</p>
<p>"This matter is, after all, a matter for the school. Everyone should share this responsibility. How can you not have a spirit of cooperation at all?"</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"What cooperation or non-cooperation? These are all small things. Now is Party Principles class. Please teach us how to overthrow imperialism." Li, who was easygoing, ridiculed in a funny tone.</p>
<p>"You are really optimists. People are in a hurry, but you are unwilling to lend a hand." Mr. Xi was disappointed and had to get back to the subject,</p>
<p>"When capitalists become extremely strong, they form imperialism, so opposing capitalists is also a way to overthrow imperialism."</p>
<p>"………………………………"</p>
<p>The next day, Mr. Xi held a general assembly specifically to report the theft.</p>
<p>"It is very embarrassing for a theft to occur in the school, because everyone is an intellectual. How can they still do such a thing? However, it was not found in the dormitory yesterday. I think this is not only the fault of the thief, but also the negligence of the loser. Now that there is this sacrifice, it is giving you a very good lesson. From now on, be careful. If the same accident happens again, I will not be responsible."</p>
<p>"Could it be that my money was lost for nothing?" Ni said softly to herself.</p>
<p>"Strange, why didn't he search the janitors and nannies when he searched the female students' dormitories yesterday? Today, he said these few words and considered the matter closed?"</p>
<p>"The janitor is his godfather, and the nanny is his mother-in-law…"</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense."</p>
<p>Mr. Xi is sick. It is said that he is lovesick. The other party is a certain teacher who teaches handicrafts at the school.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, you all know about the various aspects of our school's Dean of Discipline. I hope you will also write about your Deans of Discipline for comparison. At the same time, you can also know what kind of talents the Deans of Discipline in schools are now.</p>
<h3>In the Chemical Experiment Room</h3>
<p>— Li Zunquan</p>
<p>He took an iron basin and placed it on the central floor of the chemical experiment room. He poured some potassium chlorate and sugar powder into it and mixed them evenly. Then he returned to a corner of the room, took out a bottle of concentrated sulfuric acid, and placed it flat on the table. He used a dropper – a glass tube used for eye drops – and sucked a little sulfuric acid, then dripped a few drops into the iron basin. In this way, the potassium chlorate caused a strong heat due to the action of the sulfuric acid, and the sugar powder placed with the potassium chlorate was carbonized and ignited. He used a piece of waste paper as a medium to light the alcohol lamp. He then placed the lamp – the alcohol lamp – under the copper kettle placed on the tripod. In less than three minutes, the water in the kettle was hot. He poured a cup, and while drinking, walked to the window.</p>
<p>He had used this method to boil water – when he woke up thirsty in the middle of the night and couldn't find a match – countless times. But this time, he recalled a past event. This may have been because he used an excessive amount of potassium chlorate this time, resulting in a loud explosion. Or perhaps it was because the same scenery touched his mood.</p>
<p>It was also such a scene, probably. Everything in the vast and boundless wilderness, except for a few twinkling solitary stars, and a faint light emitted from his chemical experiment room, nothing else. Nothing could be seen. Truly, there was only deathly desolation and silence.</p>
<p>He sat next to a writing desk near the window, his eyes fixed on the elastic rubber (Gutta Purcha) and other mixtures in the pliers pot placed on the alcohol lamp.</p>
<p>Because there was no gas pipe installed in the countryside, naturally, there was no talk of using a Bunsen burner – a Bunsen burner that could adjust the heat and generate heat suitable for the required amount – to heat it to a suitable temperature. So he waited, constantly removing the alcohol lamp to prevent the heat from getting too high.</p>
<p>"Zong," a very familiar voice came in from outside the window.</p>
<p>"Ah, Lan, why are you here at this time? Is there anything important? Are you here alone?" He looked outside in surprise, half welcoming, half refusing to ask her.</p>
<p>"Yes, please open the door."</p>
<p>"Um," he hummed as he went to open the door.</p>
<p>—Boom—……pat pat……—An explosive, cracking sound, followed by a burst of firecrackers, lit up the entire room, and at the same time, thick smoke filled the air, scaring her, who had just stepped in, onto him. He, who had experience with explosions – often having explosions and not taking them seriously – was also a little flustered and at a loss for what to do. Did he want to go outside? Then what about Lan? He could only maintain a calm attitude and say,</p>
<p>"Lan... you... don't be like this... let me go put out the fire..."</p>
<p>"……" She closed her eyes and simply leaned on his chest.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the fire went out on its own in a few seconds. But a large area of the ceiling had been blackened by the smoke and fire.</p>
<p>He watched the fire go out, his heart settled. He wanted to push Lan away, but he didn't know why, it was as if he couldn't bear to. He supported her, or rather, put his arm around her, and went to the sofa. He and she sat side by side. He comforted her,</p>
<p>"Lan, look, it's calm now." He saw that she had her eyes closed.</p>
<p>"Ah, what's going on..." She opened her two tearful eyes, and immediately closed them again.</p>
<p>"Fine… you're scaring me, why do you want to scare me, threaten me… like… this, is it beneficial to you… you don't want me to come, just explain it clearly, why, why do you want to tease me like this, are you satisfied now, I haven't done anything to offend you, why do you want to hurt me, kill me, if you want to kill, just kill me like this, I…" She was crying, really crying. He initially thought it was the thick smoke that was making her tear up, so he gently wiped them away for her. But at this moment he understood, and this unexpected remark made him anxious and flustered, more flustered than when he heard the explosion. He quickly pushed her away, showed a solemn attitude, and defended himself, stating that he was open and honest, and that he revered and loved her, explaining that it was because he was too careless that the chemicals exploded, assuming that he was wrong, and that there should be a possibility of forgiveness. Finally, he said even more, "...If it weren't for you, I definitely wouldn't have left that seat, at least, I would have suffered some damage, in any part of my body, I really, don't know how to thank you... " He said a lot of words, only getting a few irrelevant echoes from her. As for what was in her heart, did she believe his words, did she mean to act spoiled?</p>
<p>Even he himself didn't know – and even now, he still doesn't know.</p>

<h3>This Year is a Year of Solar Anomalies</h3>
<p>Sunspots Suddenly Rare</p>
<p>—Talks of Japanese Astronomers—</p>
<p>Kobe News, sunspots were discovered all over the sun three or four years ago, surprising humanity. Recently, the Kobe Marine Meteorological Observatory in Japan used a ten-inch telescope to observe. On the ninth of this month, only three spots were seen in the southeast of the sun. The image was photographed in a dark room. The larger one was about one minute, and the smaller one was about five tenths of a minute, faintly visible. In particular, nothing was seen during the two-star period from June 13th to 27th. Afterwards, it reappeared. According to the members of the solar observation department of the meteorological observatory, it will continue to decrease next year. According to Dr. Ueda Nō, Professor of Astronomy at the Faculty of Science of Sai Kyo University, the decrease in sunspots generally takes eleven years as the first period. The least amount was in 1923, so this time it is 1934. Judging from the period, although it is currently in the middle, it continues to show this phenomenon. The previous year, its example, especially continuing for ten days, is a rare phenomenon. This year is really a year of solar anomalies, but what kind of impact the decrease of sunspots has on the earth and the weather has not yet been determined. It is difficult to say definitively, but it is not a completely annual phenomenon, so the configuration of air pressure also has times when it is put under special conditions. In short, put it under the conditions of special changes in the weather, that is, in the year when there are more sunspots, the earth seems to be generally not hot, but in the year when there are fewer sunspots, there are cool places on the earth, and there are also places where it is particularly hot, so it is difficult to say that it is a principle, it is said.</p>
<h3>Eight Women's Organizations Meet in Geneva</h3>
<p>Seeking Opinions from Major Women's Organizations on the Nationality Issue of Women Marrying Foreign Men</p>
<p>Geneva News, an international league committee composed entirely of women recently met in Geneva. This is the beginning of the League of Nations having a women's committee. This committee is seeking opinions from major women's organizations around the world to resolve the nationality issue of women marrying foreign men, but it will be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly in September. This nationality issue is extremely complex. It is expected that the committee will not ask how it is resolved, but only take the fundamental position that women should not be discriminated against. After the final resolution of the League of Nations Assembly in September, an international conference will be convened to discuss an international convention to be observed. The committee convened this time is composed of two representatives from each of the following eight international women's organizations: 1. International Council of Women, 2. International Women's Reference League, 3. Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, 4. Inter-American Commission of Women, 5. Equal Rights International, 6. World Women's Association, 7. All-Asian Women's Conference, 8. International Federation of University Women,</p>
<h3>American Education Conference to be Held</h3>

<p>New York News, The Fourth International Education Conference is scheduled to be held next month in Denver, the capital of Colorado, USA, and invitations have been sent to various countries to send representatives to attend.</p>
<h3>Car Drivers are Responsible for Living Things</h3>
<p>It is a Moral Issue, Not a Legal Issue, The Same Applies to Chickens as it Does to People</p>
<p>According to American reports, car drivers often have several questions, namely, "Does a chicken have the right to cross the road and obstruct the progress of a car? Does a chicken farmer have the responsibility to keep chickens within a certain area? Should a car driver be responsible for compensation if they run over a chicken?" Mr. Stogner, the motor vehicle supervision commissioner of the State of Connecticut, has recently answered these questions. He said that these questions are more a moral issue than a legal issue. The use of dangerous machines (referring to cars) contains the possibility of killing chickens, so of course it should be done carefully. Therefore, every car driver must pay considerable attention and caution to any domestic creatures. This is a clear moral responsibility. Generally, the regulations regarding cars and children on the road can be applied to living things, it is said.</p>
<h3>European Countries Expand Rayon Sales</h3>
<p>It is More Difficult to Export Silk</p>
<p>European News, European countries have high tariff barriers on silk, making it more difficult to export silk. However, rayon and cotton cloth do not have such barriers, and various countries are expanding their sales extremely fiercely. In countries such as England, France, and Germany, the lower middle class has a greater need for silk made in Czechoslovakia, it is said.</p>
<h3>Pregnant Murderers are Exempted from the Death Penalty</h3>
<p>British Parliament Passes New Law</p>
<p>London News, the British House of Commons recently passed a bill unanimously without debate or opposition, abolishing the death penalty (hanging) for pregnant murderers. In the future, the heaviest penalty for pregnant women who commit this crime will be life imprisonment. This new law is the result of public agitation over the Wessey case. Mrs. Wessey was sentenced to death for killing her nine-year-old child while pregnant. Later, she gave birth to twins, and the court declared a reprieve, it is said.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Promotes Merger of Two Major Petroleum Companies</h3>
<p>Major Revision of the Anti-Trust Ban Policy: Related to Anti-Russian Movement</p>
<p>New York Dispatch: The merger of New York Standard Oil (capital of $434 million) and Vacuum Oil (capital of $128 million), which was previously not approved by the U.S. government due to conflict with anti-trust laws, will now be promoted after a decision to stop the appeal to the Supreme Court. This fact clearly indicates a major revision, or even a shift in direction, of the traditional American policy of prohibiting trusts. The superficial reason for approving the merger is to facilitate the control of oil production quotas in the U.S. oil industry, but it is related to the recent anti-Russian movement expressed by President Hoover's proposal to postpone war debt payments and ban the import of Russian goods under the pretext of forced labor. It can be generally seen that the Standard Oil system is at the forefront of opposing the dumping of Russian oil.</p>
<h3>International Fisheries Conference</h3>

<h3>Marshal Foch's War Diary from the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The Allied forces had fought bitterly for four years, and were exhausted and hoarse. Added to these mental blows, morale was low, and combat effectiveness naturally weakened. Fortunately, the soldiers under our banner were prepared to sacrifice themselves to reverse the decline. Clemenceau and Lloyd George, in their positions as leaders of their respective governments, used their excellent perseverance to assist the war effort. President Wilson joined the battle late, but now eagerly hoped to help the war effort wholeheartedly with the strong power of the United States. The responsibility of the Supreme Commander lies in applying positive methods to shorten the crisis, paying attention to weaknesses, avoiding confusion, and quickly reversing the situation.</p>
<p>At that time, on June 5th, in order to prevent the enemy from attacking between Montdidier and Noyon, I transferred a division (the 14th Division) from the detachment on that front to General Pétain's command. I asked General Haig to study the problem of another division of British troops replacing this detachment.</p>
<p>I made various arrangements to avoid the disadvantage of the Allied forces only being able to parry without being able to retaliate. On one hand, I transferred the reorganized French divisions and the American troops arriving from the British side to the areas of Lorraine and Vosges. On the other hand, I transferred some French troops to the British line to prepare for the German offensive that could occur at any time in the area of the Somme and Arras. At the same time, I studied the possibility of launching an offensive north of the Somme and on the front line of the French Fifth Army in order to restrain the enemy's forces while taking a defensive stance on the Oise River.</p>
<p>Finally, as the decisive battle was about to begin, I wrote to the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, telling him not to forget to base his actions on the operational plan, to achieve strategic results, to fulfill the various responsibilities of a commander, and to instill the appropriate spirit in all participating officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>After the artillery bombardment that began at midnight on June 9th, Commander Hutier's infantry reached our defensive line between the Avre valley and the Matz valley at 3:45 a.m. At 6:00 a.m., the enemy's attack extended to the Oise River.</p>
<p>The German forces were not evenly distributed along the line. The forces on both wings were scattered, while the forces in the center were concentrated between Lassigny and the Matz valley, undertaking the offensive with nine to thirteen divisions.</p>
<p>The Allied forces collapsed in the center. The French 58th and 125th Divisions retreated immediately upon contact. Around 7:00 a.m., they were driven by the enemy past Gury. Around</p>
<p>10:00 a.m., the enemy captured our second line, from Marie to Méry-la-Montagne, a length of seven and a half miles. The Saint-Claude plateau and the Matz forest also fell into enemy hands one after another.</p>
<p>Six divisions of the French reserves joined the battle, and fortunately, they thwarted the enemy's offensive in the afternoon. In the evening, the enemy stopped at the line of Marie, Belloy, Margny, and Vandélicourt.</p>
<p>In short, Commander Hutier's attack, except for the right wing where there was not much progress, had indeed broken through the French defensive line in all other directions. Compiègne was directly threatened.</p>
<p>But I believed that the strength of the reserve corps was still sufficient to cope with this situation. Moreover, the Bavarian Crown Prince's troops had not joined the battle on June 9th. I therefore decided not to move Haig's forces. However, as a precaution, I asked him to transfer a division from the southern part of the 22nd Corps to the vicinity of Conty on the morning of the 10th, and then to fill the gap south of the Somme with another division. This would enable General Pétain to deploy all of the French reserves behind the First Army.</p>
<p>On the 10th, the enemy continued to attack, but not as smoothly as the day before. Although the enemy added a fresh division to help the battle, he only gained some ground west of Méry. His only important progress was east of Méry, where the retreat of the French 53rd Division opened the door directly to the Ribecourt valley. The Germans were able to gain a foothold between Montmacq and Chevincourt on the right bank of the Oise River. However, the extension of German forces in this area threatened the retreat of the French forces (38th Corps) on the left bank of the Oise River to Barisis, Tracy-le-Val, and Pusy-la-Campagne, the old defensive line of 1914.</p>
<p>Despite this setback, the results of the 10th were generally satisfactory. "The enemy's advance was not as smooth as the several offensives since March. Our army is firmly holding its ground with a step-by-step defense. The reinforcements that have arrived can also be deployed appropriately." French defensive works, based on recent plans, are arranged both deep and solid, causing the enemy's sudden attacks under intense artillery fire to be frustrated and stopped.</p>
<p>Commander Fayolle is now preparing to launch a large-scale counter-offensive against the enemy's flanks with five fresh divisions, four divisions in the first line, taking advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>After the German army's third offensive in the spring of 1918, my important responsibility was to consolidate the current situation and plan for the Allied forces' future operations based on the lessons of recent battles.</p>
<p>Although we are extremely interested in past battles, the urgent needs of the current situation should be given priority. The enemy clearly will not be content with the setback in the Méry area. The enemy still has a strong reserve army. It is said that there were 54 divisions on June 15th, 61 divisions on June 20th, and 75 divisions on June 30th. Among them, the 55th division is a fresh force.</p>
<p>The enemy has made very smooth progress on the Somme, Flanders, Champagne, and Oise River fronts. Our army has suffered heavy losses. The enemy seems to have a need to take advantage of superior forces and advance victoriously. On the one hand, he must know that the United States will soon join the war with its unstoppable force. On the other hand, he must feel that the crisis that the British and French armies have already experienced is approaching him. (Note: In June 1918, the German Supreme Command had to call up soldiers of the 1919 class and new recruits of the 1920 class. Some were formed in May and could be sent to the front line in July).</p>
<p>Therefore, the enemy will soon launch a new offensive, but where will they attack? Although it is believed that he will attack the British line, we cannot ignore the possibility that large enemy forces may move against any section of the French line. Therefore, I decided that the Allied reserve forces should be prepared to move to the front line from the North Sea to the Vosges River at any time to assist the British or French forces in battle. Both the British and French armies must be fully prepared to meet the enemy. (To be continued)</p>
