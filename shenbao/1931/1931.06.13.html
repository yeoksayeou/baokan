<h3 id="c13">日内田繼任滿鐵總裁 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>今日東京電。日滿鐵總裁仙石辭職。閣議以是缺對華關係重要。决以曾任外相代首相及駐華公使之大人物内田康哉氏繼任。此亦爲我國人極應注意之一事也。</p>
<p>滿鐵爲中日交涉最重要之懸案。而今日中日兩國委員。正將東北開議。日人方面以此會議。爲日本在華權利攸關。而又鑒於中國廢除不平等條約之倡導。懾於外間鐵路綱之宣傳。大有疑心生暗鬼急起抵抗之象。觀其近日所發表之對外同志會宣言。對鐵道問題。决主强硬化。對其他權益。决以緊急處置。日本朝野名士。列名發起者甚多。公爵男爵。亦有多人在内。可見日人之處心積慮。欲堅决擁護其所謂滿鐵旣得權者。已無可諱。今者内田氏之繼任總裁。據謂係若槻首相尊重西園寺公之意見而推舉之。質言之即尊重一般元老之鐵路政策也。内田氏雖號稱超然派。然旣爲老派人物。其思想政策。必不輕易變更。且其任駐華公使時代。去今雖遠。當時日本之對華外交政策。國人尙能記憶。今以時代過去之外交家。當今日南滿鐵路之重任。倘若迎合日人一時之狂獗之潮流。忘其爲平等世界。堅持向來一貫之政策而猛力進行。則今後東北之鐵路交涉。更難樂觀矣。</p>

<p>廣東局面决難持久</p>
<p>剿匪工作積極進行</p>
<p>（南京）本報記者頃訪王伯羣、關於時局情形、有所詢問、承彼一一見答、爰分述如次、</p>
<p>（問）部長抱恙甚久、已否回復健康、（答）初係足疾復發、繼染傷寒、照西醫慣例、須靜養四星期、故回京期不免稽延、當余病時、恰値多事之秋、各方頗多猜疑、現旣回部服務、謡言自息、</p>
<p>（問）部長對廣東事件、有何感想、（答）余忍廣東事件、爲去年北平擴會的廻光返照、擴會失敗後、反動派常欲伺隙而動、如胡先生去職事發生、彼等認爲絶好機會、聳動陳濟棠、在粤發難、然苦於勢孤、不得不聯絡張桂軍、更連帶及於組派、與張桂軍的同盟者、回想汪精衛與胡先生過去的歷史、及胡先生去歲反對擴會的决心、乃少數反動分子、竟欲將其牽入游渦、破壞胡先生名譽、寗非夢想、</p>
<p>（問）依部長觀察、廣東事件、將來如何演變、（答）現在廣東的重要脚色、其信仰意見歷史、各各不同、情感上更是敵友混雜、斷無成事之理、據最近消息、張惠長陳策、已表示消極、汪精衛與陳濟棠、因改組省黨部、發生極大意見、孫哲生退還省主席委狀後、雖以林雲陔承乏、然因事事牽制、已經灰心、故廣東局面、决難持久、</p>
<p>（問）中央對粤事、究取若何態度、（答）據余所知、中央始終抱和平統一態度、但如果彼等終不覺悟、甘爲禍首、故亦有相當準備、</p>
<p>（問）江西剿匪情形如何、（答）迭接何敬之部長來電、赤匪自聞粤事發生、負嵎頑抗冀圖蔓延、惟中央認定、剿匪爲中國民族存亡問題、較粤事尤爲重要、故對剿匪工作、仍積極猛進、</p>
<p>（問）盛傳交鐵兩部、有合併消息、確否、（答）此項問題、權在中央、余因地位關係、未便發表意見、</p>
<p>（問）部長最近登報啓事、與保女士結婚、其經過可得聞乎、（答）余於十七年冬、元配逝世、家慈以余内助需人、屢令續絃、親友和之、物色介紹、日不暇給、余因舊式婚姻、毎多不滿、遂謝親友、而自行留意、保君季新、本係好友、常相往還、因得識其猶女志寗、志寗勤學、無時下風、於去冬大學畢業後、家慈因年老多疾、促余續絃益急、於是始託親友作伐、得其家長同意、婚約始定、外間謡言、謂係重金納妾、自有事實上證明、不足置辯、（十二日專電）</p>

<p>— 柯定盡</p>
<p>日昨午後。老友王一鳴見記。偕來者三人。謂來自湘江。蓋不安於故鄉匪擾。相率來海上。以謀安居。並出定武眞蹟蘭亭集序。曩見桑世昌蘭亭考。中有「唐文皇得蘭亭眞蹟。刻之學士院。朱梁纂竊。輦置汴都。耶律德黨破石晋。此刻渡河。帝羓旣歸。與輜重棄之殺虎林。後置之定州州治。遂日定本。世稱定武蘭亭。因定州唐時置義武軍。宋避太宗諱。改名定武故也。寗和中。詔宣定武校衙舊人。問蘭亭石。輾轉得之於長安帥薛嗣昌處。時内侍梁師成爲長安承受官。批旨取舊刻。嗣昌倉卒以紙三幅作一重撫石。第一本墨深。第二本墨淺。第三生又加淺。世謂之蟬翼本：：」云云。又庚子銷夏記。亦有「孫承澤亦謂世所傳定武本有肥瘦二種：」云云。余今年見者。卷長數丈。字跡朗然。斷其爲定武眞本無疑。當時修褉之羣賢。亦於卷上繪出。神采奕奕。工細絶倫。並各系小傳。備極典麗。洵爲世間不易多覯之神品也。黃庭堅橫卷。生龍活虎。氣足神完。余友蒙翁壽芝。喜作山谷書品。近有「妙法蓮華經」書行。筆力遒勁。足與山谷媲美。右任跋中。有「山谷再世亦當首肯」之語。誠非過譽。是卷蒙翁得見。當爲怡然稱快也。淸代何紹基曾國藩等所書屏條四幅。乾隆間第一人及第之王偉人「秋水泛金鵝」立軸。並皆佳妙。與商鼎同時出土之古盤一事。式如舊時銅盆。雖中有破孔。叩之。則鏘然作金聲。斯爲可異。（商鼎已爲某洋行購去價値二萬餘金云）間有刀痕。燦燦若黃金。殊炫人目。不知其究爲何代物也。唐之靑銅鏡。惜已分碎爲二。據云人臨高處。向此鏡斜視。能觀數十里外之景物。毫釐不爽。鏡面綠花斑駁。色澤雅樸。一古代之望遠鏡也、暈紅脂玉一方。狀若龜甲而小。對光視之。中有松葉顯然。仿彿工整畫。品。凡此種種。誠爲稀世大寳。亟爲修書。介紹於黃賓虹張善孖二公。加以鑒評。而余無意中得拜觀一過。眼福爲無量矣。主有者。爲湘江李氏。其先人與曾國藩爲同寅友云。</p>

<p>— 周才良</p>
<p>秦山爲金邑名勝地。相傳謂昔之秦始皇南遊時。曾駐蹕於此。距我鎭（張溪）約二里許。即南社巨子高吹萬先生之珂里也。毎歲値廢曆之三月朔望廿八及四月朔日。輒有農具市場之集。屆期如約而至者。無間遐邇。熙來攘往。貿易頗盛。惟過午則頓歸　寂。蓋尙沿襲古代日中爲市之舊制也。日前予適因事返里。而又恰逢今歲該市塲之最後一次。乃知機不可失。爰於晨興後。即徒步而往。行行重行行。未半小時而即逹。沿途竹籬茅舍。風景幽宜。頗足使久困於塵市者。胸襟爲之一爽。及抵山麓。則見人山人海。肩摩踵接。大有册陰道上之勢。綜計兩旁設攤凡二百餘。全山幾無隙處。視所陳列。則大抵以農具爲最多。惜仍墨守舊法。午篇一列。我國農産事業之不進步。言之可嘆。繼乃拾級而上。步行凡三折而始逹山巓。巓有一古寺。寺屋橫列僅三楹。而境頗淸曠。予迺入内稍息。坐甫定。忽覩壁上有所謂歪詩者。塗抹殆滿。雅俗雜陳。閲之殊堪發噱。此種汚衊名勝之惡習。未知昉自何人。語云。名土不値半文錢。信然。旋辭出。天忽陣雨。遂逕至山下凉亭暫避。時隨予而來者。愈聚愈衆。未幾。即告客滿。亭係新築。製有一聯云、「最惜飄蓬如過客。不堪折柳贈行人。」語意深刻。頗足使予儕過客讀之而心驚不已也。少頃雨止。而農市亦告終。予始言旋歸而爲之記。</p>

<p>— 劉夢蝶</p>
<p>錫之東亭鎭。有華氏者。三笑彈詞中華太師洪山之後人也。有女出嫁相去三十里之長安鎭。旣生子矣。一日下午。女見東亭人某甲岔息而至。告曰。爾父昨夜三更忽得急病。醫治不及。天明死矣。我來報喪也。女聞之大驚。一　幾絶。甲旋續言曰。爾母言。術者已定今日夜半入殮。命爾坐肩輿奔歸。所有衣包諸物。輿中不便携帶者。可先收拾交我帶回日幕途遥。速爲計也。女然其說。急向閨中摒擋諸事。念此行須留住多日。故衣履飾物備足。成一大包。旣畢。以甲向出入母家。似曾相識。不之疑也。即授之而去。俄而女倩人爲備肩輿。抱子登輿。一路掩泣而行。及抵家。天已黑。下輿入門。即縱聲大哭。聲聲呼父。父於内室聞聲。驚出問故。家人亦畢集而驚。乃女見父而驚益甚也。已而知父無恙。始拭涙而笑。轉悲爲喜。若不暇計衣包之損失也者。然父恚甚。命人徧覓某甲於市。而杳如黃鶴矣。蓋甲故紅丸黨之健者。近絶糧已三日。乃異想天開。以濟在陳之憂。然太惡作劇矣。</p>
<h3 id="c228">負氣後之成功 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 鷄冠</p>
<p>前日在友人席上。聞周君言。夫子廟附近有二食肆。望衡比字。相互作營業上之競爭。據知者道。中含一段負氣之歷史。述之亦足解頣也。</p>
<p>初寗人有金某者。淸晨率就食於外。某日至夫子廟某餐館進茶點。適生意鼎盛。堂倌奔走甚忙。俟一小時餘。而所呼包餕。久久不至。金不耐。盛氣質館侍。侍不爲下。亦怒目相向。且嘲之曰。若以此間招待不周。食品太遲。則祗好君自已設一餐館。始能指揮如意矣。冷語帶諷。金乃憤然離座而出。不意時越數月。隣近即聞有新肆之開張。所售揚製點食。無不相同。其主人即負氣而出之金某也。營業經年。生涯不惡。後來居上。此實受館侍一激之賜矣。</p>
<p>又曩聞故鄉人談。吳興城内館驛河兩岸。渡船林立。可由此之逹金婆弄及右文館前。城有溫某。家富於資。某日天雨就渡。容與中流。頗嫌遲滯。因與榜人發生口角。榜人亦不遜。譏之曰。汝欲求速。祗好在河上架橋耳。彼殆不識爲溫某。故以此難之也。其後地方上忽聞有鳩工造橋之議。主其事者。即受辱於榜人之溫某是。橋於前歲告成。題名曰苕梁。一時渡船營業。大受打擊。而行人亦稱便利。金錢萬能。此與前述殊途而同歸。無以名之。祗可目爲負氣後之成功而已。</p>
<p>藝訉　名畫家趙半跛吳子鼎馬萬里三君。均擅詩書畫三絶之才。尺帛寸練。得者寳之。現特於（十三日）起。聯合舉行畫展會於寗波同鄉會。爲期三日。想當有一悉盛况云（太瘦生）</p>

<p>— 陶麗亞</p>
<p>女子束胸之風。自盛行以來。前行後效。有進無退。雖歷經内政部遵令查禁。無如言者諄諄。聽乾藐藐。而尤以各學校女生爲最。現聞浙江蕭山縣立女子中學。以女生束胸。實屬有礙身體健康。特令各女生一律解放。并擬定期檢查。以免隱諱。故該校女生。日來莫不羞形於色云。</p>
<p>女子束胸之害。非但關係個人身體之康健及嫁後之生育。至深且鉅。而影響所及。足致民族於衰弱地位。今該校首創解放。消息四播。不但爲女子本身喜。更可爲民族之前途慶也。</p>

<p>（二）爲窩頭犠牲</p>
<p>到了下午四點鐘。張小三兒是交車的時候了。把車子送到車廠子裏去。交了五十個子兒的車分。還剩下一百五十枚。也有銅子。也有銅子票。一齊揣在身上。拿五個大子。買了一盒烟捲。嘴裏啣着一根。挨着墻陰。一步慢似一步的走回去。他家是個大雜院。統共十幾間房。住了八家人家。這個大雜院的大字。不是贊這房屋大。乃是贊這院子大雜而特雜。這信家人家。除了三家拉車的而外。都是尙鞋匠趕大車揑糖人兒的一些小手藝買賣。張小三一進院子。就見他媳婦張二嫂拿着肥皂臉盆。放在屋檐下一張方凳子上。那様子是打算洗臉。他走上前。一伸脚。凳子踢翻了。臉盆噹的一聲。潑了一地的水。張二嫂正要進屋子去拿白布手巾呢。一回頭頓着脚道。「你抽瘋了嗎。臉盆碍着你什麽事。」張小三將嘴上的烟捲。抿着斜樹了起來。駡道。「拉車的媳婦。買洋胰子洗臉。美個什麽　兒。我張小三不打虎。（註。打虎者。即以妻嫁人。然後席捲而逃之騙局。）用不着你這様苦搗飾。要不然。這胡同裏那個小白臉子好。你想勾引他。」張二嫂是個黃色的柿子臉。腦後梳拖髻。宜拖到脖子上去。可是左右兩邊。都有一大仔黃頭髮。拖到耳朶邊。身上一件藍布褂子。像道袍一般。布不貼肉。伊頭一擺。兩仔亂髮和拖髻。都隨着摇擺。將那隻露出半截的黃蠟胳膞。抬將起來。指點着道。「張小三兒。你說的是人話嗎。人窮水不窮。窮得臉都不該要嗎。八個子兒買塊糙胰子洗臉。這不算過分。你捨不得這幾個子兒也成。往後我屎裏抓一把。尿裏抓一把。就這様作飯你吃。我告訴你。往後别這様發窮瘋。老娘是騎驢子翻賬本兒。走着瞧。」張小三兒將嘴裏烟捲。向地下一扔。噗哧一聲笑道。「他倒拿矯。張小三不短這様一個巧媳婦。多咱發了財。咱們是：：：」砰的一聲。屋子門關上了。張二嫂在屋子裏道。「别進來了。發財去罷。」張小三道。「别鬧。我得進去拿小衣換。我要到澡堂子裏去洗個澡。」張二嫂道。「誰和你鬧。你不到尿桶裏去照照你的臉。你也配嗎。」</p>

<h3 id="c266">法將福煦歐戰日記 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>「英法美軍各總司令繼續指揮其部隊、各總司令如以福煦將軍的訓令致使其部隊處於危險地位有權向本國政府申訴、」</p>
<p>勞合喬治君從倫敦前來出席、在百龍上岸驅車到蒲伐亞、克萊孟梭君已先到、喬治君在途中遇着向後撤退的英軍、他見軍容不振軍心渙散、知道形勢不佳、因此他帶了沮喪的印象到會甚遲、</p>
<p>不過他不久就擺脫了這頺唐的神氣而恢復了他回來奮發有爲的特性、他在會議席上他對我聲明道一英國人民對君信任、你被推爲聯軍總司令在我國裏一致歡迎、」</p>
<p>散了會我們離室而去、他以慣常愉快的態度對我說、「現在我賭何人、羅登獨夫呢、還是福煦呢、」我泰然自若的回答他道、「你先得做我的後盾你就贏了、因爲羅登獨夫必須攻破我軍、現在他無能爲力了、至於我們呢、我軍現在的任務就在阻止他、關於此點我們很有把握、以後我們到了時機攻破他、｜那是另一問題、我們能做到怎様地步、不久就見分曉了、」</p>
<p>蒲伐亞恊定不能完全容納我的建議、因此未能把我的職權擴充到節制自北海以至亞德里亞海西綫的全綫、或在那裏作戰的全部聯軍、不過它已經包含指揮法綫戰事的要素、法綫是主要戰區、作戰的美英法軍也是聯軍的主力軍隊、但克萊阵梭君現已得着英美政府贊成這新方案、他一定寗願先把聯軍總司令的權力限止在這戰區及這三部軍隊、以待時機的成熟、這結果一旦獲得、他保留着圖謀將來擴充恊定的可能到包括意大利戰區、一面及到比軍、一面及到意軍、</p>
<p>意國加入的動議、最高戰事評議會曾於五月二日在亞伯費加以研究、翁倫多君及宋尼拿君、以意政府的名義、宣稱、不能無條件的贊同蒲伐協定、但他們爲妥洽起見、主張把意綫及意軍的指揮加以區别、這方案經其他政府同意、内容如下、</p>
<p>㈠意綫從現在起依照杜倫恊定歸福煦將軍節制、</p>
<p>㈡至於意軍、須俟别國聯軍至阿爾帕斯山外在他指揮之下如在法境同様形勢中作戰的時候、始歸其節制、</p>
<p>意政府這様的限制仍使聯軍總司令有權巡視意綫、到必要的時候且可利用橫跨亞爾帕斯山戰區的可能實行其戰略</p>
<p>關於比軍部分、最高戰事評議會於七月三日在凡爾賽討論這個問題、當時聯軍準備在法境採取攻勢、預計要把比軍參加這次戰事、最好把他們同别國聯軍一様歸我節制、但比軍參謀長紀倫少將引據比國的憲法正式反對此議、因未能成立諒解、</p>
<p>實則這種不妥洽的態度大半發生於原則上面、並不是一成不變的、幾星期後、比王絶不猶豫的接受依據聨軍總司令的調度指揮比法英美聯軍在法蘭作戰的任務、</p>
<p>五月二日、協約國政府議决取銷三月前成立的執行委員會、因現在無此必要了、五月十四日、我接着法境聯軍總司令的稱號、</p>
<p>但這不過是在紙上規定我的職權的正式手續、實際上這様産生的聯軍總司令如何行施職權尙待分曉、</p>
<p>一九一八年四月初、形勢仍舊岌岌可危、戰綫因敵人的屢次勝利而展期、要以力竭聲嘶的士卒挽回頺勢、不可再事磋砣了、</p>
<p>在他方面、貝當將軍把第五軍沿着亞眠更向北開進、這支軍隊因爲當時不想採取攻勢、因從後備軍抽調補充、他且把疴阿斯軍圑向西調動、這軍圑有兩師之衆、其中一部分向疴阿斯河右岸前進、他更把第一騎兵圑從安逹里調到奥美爾、</p>
<p>福悅將軍奉令立刻調動左翼的後備軍、以備在逼切的時候在魯斯沙姆戰區援助英國第四軍、</p>
<p>末了、訓令第十軍司令梅斯特將軍處置阿拉斯前敵的軍事、如其敵軍進攻、則主要的防綫務必全力固守、作戰的步驟、訓令裏爲他及第三軍統統規定好的、他開頭的佈置和他參戰的方法也給他指明的、</p>
<p>佈置法軍在阿拉斯與沙姆河之間參戰的時候、我也注意到盡力援助英軍總司令、因他給法蘭特戰爭的物質的及精神的困難弄得心神不寗、十二日我决定把兩天前已開始供給他的援兵增加、</p>
<p>我因令奥美爾區域的後備隊、第二騎兵圑向聖亞美開拔、十三日開到之後、準備會合法軍百三十三師增援英國第二軍、</p>
<p>第二騎兵圑司令羅皮育將軍來到沙格斯（註、我的司令部自四月七日已遷移到沙格斯、在格蘭費邑的西北三哩、）請訓、爲他指示作戰的任務的時候、我特别吩咐他竭力維持英國第一第二軍間的連絡、</p>
<p>戰略的大綱如下、</p>
<p>㈠全力支持罅口的兩翼、在北面繼續的佔據克末爾加賽爾山之綫、向南、在南面繼續的佔據倍塞内聖亞美之綫、向東北、</p>
<p>㈡在這固守的兩翼之間、向東佔領各要點阻敵前進、</p>

<p>日期　定今明兩日</p>
<p>地點　寗波同鄉會</p>
<p>復旦劇社自上屆公演「西哈諾」後、即籌備第十一次大公演、劇本係英國喜劇家瓊斯名作「說謊者」、已於本月一日晚在復旦大學一度公演、茲擇定今明兩日、假寗波同鄉會作盛大之貢獻、此劇經該社改譯、故極適合國情、全無空氣不調和之缺陷、加之佈景設計、矞皇典麗、劇中情節、滑稽幽默、演員精選、均屬富於舞臺經騐者、聞門券代售處爲四馬路北新、光華、現代三書局、座價爲半元一元云、</p>
<h3 id="c268">復旦的「說謊者」 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 悟</p>
<p>「近來上海的戲劇空氣沉寂極了」</p>
<p>在這三百萬人的大都會裏呼吸着的人們、誰都這様感到的吧、眞的、南國劇社、瓦解了、戲劇協社、不見有排演的消息、辛酉劇團、從表現過所謂難劇運動以來彷彿没有了努力的意思、摩登劇社、曾一度努力流動劇塲運動的也已經各溫各的好夢、停止了進行的工作、可是各種學校劇社、在十九年的所謂戲劇的年頭曾經風起雲湧接踵的活動過來、而今年來、也跟出版界的狂颷潮一稱地消沈、没落了、</p>
<p>然而、上海的愛美劇團、未見得一概汨没的吧、像最近成立的菁莪劇社、素霓劇社、不是紛紛預備着公演嗎、</p>
<p>復旦劇社、曾經接連地努力過十次的出演、對於　　着的中國戲劇界有過不少的貢獻、而且上年曾努力過在中國劇圑中不敢出演的、須有五六十人登台的偉大的「西哈諾」、現在、再扯志了大　、排練第十一次的出演、</p>
<p>這次出演的劇本、便是英國偉大的喜劇家瓊斯的傑作「說謊者」、「說謊者」、過去、是轟動過歐美的劇界、博到不少的佳評的、</p>
<p>著者、在劇中大聲疾呼一個人爲了一女子而犠牲其榮、名譽、國家責任、良心、以及一切於不顧、何等不値得呀、這在我國、正有不少爲迷戀女子而放棄民族國家的危難於不顧的人們、該是當頭的一大棒喝、</p>
<p>作爲人生的喜劇的「說謊者」、是諷剌當時英國兩性間的婚姻糾紛、是指點入了迷的男男女女、現在由該社朱端鈞先生改譯一過、使適合中國的國情、</p>
<p>劇中叙述一個南洋富商、偶然來上海遊玩、認識了幾個有丈夫的女性、而和其中最漂亮的一個陷在瘋狂一般的戀愛的怒潮中。這様的開頭、於是變化出一段又滑稽又幽默又深刻、又有人生意義的故事、</p>
<p>不意、那一對戀人碰巧在吳淞海濱旅館會晤、碰巧又給那女的丈夫的弟弟撞見、這如何得了、旅館幽會的罪名接着加在他們倆的肩上、由這様的誤會、於是最有趣味、也是全劇最緊要的關頭的第三幕展開了、</p>
<p>無可奈何的他們、跟自已的親戚朋友商量了、如何在自家的丈夫面前掩飾呢、說眞話告訴給他聽嗎、這様事情一定會越鬧越大的、决定了、造一個圓滿的謊吧、少數人商定的謊語、一步步、給大部分的人參加了、居然有三錮男性和三個女性共同圓謊、而逹到全劇最精彩的一刻、可是不幸、因爲人多口雜、預料以爲圓滿的謊語不意露了破綻、差不多鬧到不可收拾、</p>
<p>故事在這裏轉過來了、從快將破裂的一對夫妻、折到重溫舊好的路而結束、在末一幕、有幾句名言可以奉告正在離婚熱的空氣中度着悲慘生活的男女們的　　「你不要以爲你結了婚、就可以放下你的妻子不去理她了、不能的、你現在娶了一位上海最漂亮的女子、可是假使你不繼續跟她依然戀愛下去、别的人要要跟她戀愛了呢、没有話說的這是人生的悲劇、」</p>
<p>這一本劇中、有六位女士登台、破了列次各劇圑公演時需要女演員之多的例、如果將舞台換在國貨商塲、也許有人將以爲是時裝展覧會了哩、然而不是的、她們都是愛好戲劇同時頗願意爲戲劇努力的女靑年、</p>
<p>她們、這幾位女演員、是一般人口頭上所常之稱揚的東宮中的漂亮公主、最最美麗的公主呢、儘收集在這劇本中、如果需要預先介紹一番的話、也不妨略略說一說的、</p>
<p>該最先提起的、是梁培樹女士、她富於演劇的天才、無須說得的、表情的細膩、說白的明亮等等、已經有了定評、原來她曾充演偉大的西哈諾中的女主角哩、這一次、富於熱情的女主角是</p>
<p>李蓮女士、她呀、不錯的、表演的技巧很熟練、舞台的經騐非凡充足、她紛演過的角色不少啦、不愧爲名導演家手下訓練出來的一員、還有她的妺妺</p>
<p>琴荃女士、也是新劇界女演員中的人才、扮演解色的輕重不在乎、正是學習着在成功的中途、此番劇中須要幽嫻的性格的是</p>
<p>歐陽女士、她正和劇中的那個性相稱、唱的一口好歌、在對話中時、聽了、如嚦嚦鶯聲鳥語、</p>
<p>其他的幾位女士、想不能一一的介紹、總之都是話劇界中顯過頭角來的、因爲這劇中有這様多的女性、所以劇的題名曾一度改爲「說謊的女人們、」</p>
<p>如果竭望着想一見這幾位女士和這巧妙的劇情的、巧得很、今天就　波同鄉會公演了、公演云、</p>

<p>Twenty-One Central Committee Members Already in Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth Plenary Session is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony at 8 a.m. on the 13th at the Central Party Headquarters.

<p>(Nanjing) The greatest purpose of the Fifth Plenary Session is to accept the resolutions of the National Assembly, determine the date for the Fourth National Congress, and, in accordance with the Provisional Constitution, amend the Organic Law of the National Government. At the same time, all heads of Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions will be reappointed according to law. Furthermore, there will be expressions of commendation for Chiang's devoted attitude towards suppressing the bandits. It is said that there are not many proposals from the Central Committee members, as the resolutions of the National Assembly are already the crystallization of national public opinion, and only diligent implementation is needed to benefit the people and enrich the nation. Even the few proposals that do exist are nothing more than matters concerning the advancement of Party affairs. (12th Special Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The legal quorum for the Fifth Plenary Session is 19 people. There are already 21 people in Nanjing, so there is no problem for the meeting to be held tomorrow. Chiang plans to leave Nanjing on the 16th, or possibly go to Lushan on the 18th. (12th Special Dispatch).</p>

If one or two people are still lacking, he himself will fly to Nanjing to attend. (12th Special Dispatch).</p>

<p>Cheng Tianfang and Cao Haosen Appointed Chairmen</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The headquarters plans to newly form a Party Affairs Committee, divided into five sections: Secretariat, Organization, Training, Propaganda, and Evaluation; and a Political Committee, divided into four sections: Local Autonomy, Disaster Relief, Secretariat, and Inspection.

<h3 id="e12">The World Commercial Savings Bank: Aiding the Cause of Education <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Initiated by: A group of shareholders with a passion for education and extensive banking experience</p>
<p>Purpose: To allocate a portion of the shareholders' dividends to subsidize education for the poor.</p>
<p>Registered with: License granted by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government; Registration approved by the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Began operations on June 3rd</p>
<p>Interest Plus Gifts Available Before the End of June</p>
<p>The flourishing state of the Shanghai financial sector in recent years is unprecedented. However, a bank dedicated to the cause of education has been lacking. Recently, a group of shareholders from the World Book Company, who are passionate about education and have extensive banking experience, organized the World Commercial Savings Bank in Shanghai. Their highest aspiration is to use a portion of the bank's annual profits, specifically ten percent of the fifty percent of dividends designated for shareholders in the articles of association, to subsidize education for the poor. License No. 61 from the Ministry of Finance has long been granted, and the registration with the Ministry of Industry has also been approved. The head office is located in World Lane on Fourth Ma Road in Shanghai. It officially opened for business on the 3rd of this month and has quickly gained a reputation both domestically and internationally. Its operations are divided into two sections: commercial and savings. The commercial section includes: (1) commercial time deposits, with terms ranging from three months to ten years; (2) commercial demand deposits; (3) commercial current accounts; (4) overdraft facilities, all of which can be withdrawn at any time. The savings section includes: (1) demand savings deposits; (2) lump-sum deposit and withdrawal savings, with terms ranging from one to fifteen years; (3) ordinary fixed-deposit savings, with terms ranging from one to fifteen years; (4) special fixed-deposit savings, with terms ranging from one to fifteen years; (5) lump-sum deposit and installment withdrawal savings, with terms ranging from one to fifteen years; (6) periodic interest payment savings, with terms ranging from one to ten years; (7) principal-and-interest savings, with a uniform term of seven full years. The interest rates offered are higher than those of other institutions. For example, demand savings deposits offer a weekly interest rate of seven percent, calculated every six months, with interest accruing on interest. Furthermore, lump-sum deposit and withdrawal savings offer weekly interest rates ranging from 9.5 percent to 1.2 percent, which is unmatched by other savings institutions. Recognizing the difficulties of general social life, the bank has also designed various savings methods to encourage people to quickly realize the importance of savings as a safeguard for their future. For example, under the fixed-deposit savings category, if you wish to obtain a retirement fund of 10,000 yuan in the future, and you deposit for a term of fifteen years, you only need to deposit 19.3 yuan per month, and you can withdraw 10,000 yuan upon maturity. If you deposit for a term of ten years, you need to deposit 44.6 yuan per month, and you will also get 10,000 yuan upon maturity. Under the lump-sum deposit and withdrawal savings category, if you deposit 1,826.96 yuan at once for a term of fifteen years, you can also get 10,000 yuan. Under lump-sum deposit and withdrawal savings category B, if you deposit 100 yuan today for a term of fifteen years, you can get 562.35 yuan. If you deposit 5,000 yuan today for a term of ten years, you can get 14,697.15 yuan; in fifteen years, you can get a huge sum of 28,117.7 yuan. Either accumulating small amounts into large sums, which is easy and convenient, or depositing only once, which is simple and straightforward, is invariably beneficial. This is truly a great contribution to the benefit of the people. Detailed rules are available in a special chapter and can be requested at any time. Furthermore, it is reported that before the end of June, as a celebration of the opening, all savings deposited during this period will either receive an additional one percent interest, or receive book vouchers from the World Book Company, or various exquisite gifts, commemorative albums, etc., to stimulate the interest of savers. With such unique dedication to serving society, it is no wonder that the bank has won the admiration and praise of the majority of people. A1234</p>

<h3 id="e13">Uchida Succeeds Senju as President of the South Manchuria Railway <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo dispatch today. Senju, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, has resigned. The cabinet, considering the importance of this position in relation to China, decided to appoint Uchida Kosai, who previously served as Foreign Minister, Acting Prime Minister, and Ambassador to China, to succeed him. This is also something that our countrymen should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway is the most important outstanding issue in Sino-Japanese negotiations. Today, Chinese and Japanese commissioners are about to begin discussions in the Northeast. The Japanese side considers this conference to be crucial to Japan's rights in China. Furthermore, in light of China's advocacy for the abolition of unequal treaties, and intimidated by the promotion of railway networks in other countries, they are exhibiting signs of paranoia and vehemently resisting. Judging from the recent declaration of the "Overseas Comrades Association," they are determined to strengthen their stance on railway issues and take urgent measures to protect other rights and interests. Many prominent figures from the Japanese government and public sectors are listed as initiators, including several dukes and barons, indicating that the Japanese are deliberately planning to firmly defend their so-called vested rights in the South Manchuria Railway, which is undeniable. It is said that Uchida's succession as president was recommended by Prime Minister Wakatsuki, respecting the opinion of Prince Saionji. In other words, it respects the railway policy of senior statesmen in general. Although Uchida is known as a non-partisan, he is still an old-fashioned figure, and his thoughts and policies will not easily change. Although his tenure as Ambassador to China was some time ago, the Chinese people still remember Japan's foreign policy towards China at that time. Now, entrusting the important task of the South Manchuria Railway to a diplomat from the past era, if he caters to the temporary frenzy of the Japanese people, forgets that the world should be equal, insists on his consistent policies and proceeds forcefully, then the railway negotiations in the Northeast in the future will be even more difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that the price of gold has fluctuated greatly over the past year, severely impacting the economy. The main reason for this is due to the deliberate manipulation by general speculators. It is now planned to appoint several supervisors in the gold exchange to monitor gold trading and draft provisional regulations for the supervisors consisting of thirteen articles, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. If there is evidence of manipulation or agitation, it will be reported for strict action. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

However, the water level of Hongze Lake is high, and if it is discharged completely, it will inevitably dry up, which will also be detrimental to farmers' water conservancy. Currently, new-style dams and sluices will be built first, so that the water level can be freely controlled and ships can travel freely. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Situation in Guangdong Will Be Difficult to Sustain</p>
<p>Suppression of Bandits is Being Actively Pursued</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This newspaper's reporter recently visited Wang Boqun and inquired about the current situation. He kindly answered each question, which are detailed as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Minister, you have been ill for a long time. Have you recovered your health? (Answer) Initially, it was a recurrence of a foot ailment, followed by typhoid fever. According to Western medical practice, I needed to rest for four weeks, so my return to Nanjing was inevitably delayed. While I was ill, it was a time of many incidents, and there was much speculation on all sides. Now that I have returned to the Ministry, the rumors have subsided.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your thoughts on the Guangdong incident? (Answer) I believe the Guangdong incident is a last-ditch effort of the Beiping Enlarged Conference from last year. After the Enlarged Conference failed, the reactionaries constantly sought opportunities to act. When Mr. Hu resigned, they saw it as an excellent opportunity, instigated Chen Jitang to start trouble in Guangdong. However, they were hampered by their isolation and had to contact Zhang Guijun, and further linked to groups and allies of Zhang Guijun. Recalling the past history between Wang Jingwei and Mr. Hu, and Mr. Hu's determination to oppose the Enlarged Conference last year, a small number of reactionaries actually wanted to drag him into the vortex and damage Mr. Hu's reputation, which is nothing more than a dream.</p>
<p>(Question) According to your observation, how will the Guangdong incident develop in the future? (Answer) The important figures in Guangdong now have different beliefs, opinions, and histories. Emotionally, they are even more of a mixture of friends and foes, so there is no reason to succeed. According to recent news, Zhang Huichang and Chen Ce have expressed their passivity. Wang Jingwei and Chen Jitang have had major disagreements over the reorganization of the Provincial Party Headquarters. After Sun Zhesheng returned the letter of appointment for the Provincial Chairmanship, although Lin Yungai replaced him, he has become discouraged due to constant constraints. Therefore, the situation in Guangdong will be difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the Central Government's attitude towards the Guangdong affair? (Answer) As far as I know, the Central Government has always maintained an attitude of peaceful unification. However, if they ultimately do not realize their errors and are willing to be the source of trouble, then there will be corresponding preparations.</p>
<p>(Question) How is the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi progressing? (Answer) I have received repeated telegrams from Minister He Jingzhi. Since the Guangdong incident occurred, the red bandits have stubbornly resisted, hoping to spread their influence. However, the Central Government believes that the suppression of bandits is a matter of survival for the Chinese nation, which is even more important than the Guangdong affair. Therefore, the suppression of bandits is still being actively pursued.</p>
<p>(Question) There are widespread rumors that the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways will be merged. Is this true? (Answer) This matter is within the authority of the Central Government, and due to my position, I am not in a position to express an opinion.</p>
<p>(Question) Minister, you recently published a notice in the newspaper about your marriage to Miss Bao. Can you tell us about the process? (Answer) In the winter of the 17th year, my first wife passed away. My mother felt that I needed someone to assist me at home, and repeatedly urged me to remarry. Relatives and friends echoed her and introduced potential candidates, one after another. I felt that traditional marriages often led to dissatisfaction, so I declined the help of relatives and friends and paid attention on my own. Miss Bao Jixin was originally a good friend, and we often interacted, so I came to know her niece, Zhi Ning. Zhi Ning is diligent in her studies and has no airs. After graduating from university last winter, my mother urged me to remarry even more urgently due to her old age and frequent illnesses. Therefore, I entrusted relatives and friends to act as matchmakers and obtained the consent of her parents, and the marriage agreement was finalized. Outside rumors that I paid a large sum to take a concubine will be proven by the facts and are not worth refuting. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Committee Did Not Convene Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee decided to organize a committee to plan everything for eliminating the red bandits and pacifying the local areas. A meeting was scheduled to be held at 9:00 a.m. on the 12th in the Second Meeting Hall of the Central Government. However, due to the small number of committee members who attended, it could not be convened. It will be rescheduled after Secretary-General Chen Lifu recovers from his illness. The name of the committee has not yet been determined. As for how to eliminate the red bandits in the future, it will not be announced because it is related to military affairs.

<p>Meeting Decided to Be Held on the 16th</p>
<p>(Nanjing) For the reorganization of the Shanghai French Concession Law Court, the Chinese and French sides have previously decided that each side would send two representatives to hold a meeting to negotiate. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held at 5:00 p.m. on the 12th. However, since the second French representative, Mr. Gregerin, the French Consul General in Shanghai, had not yet arrived in Nanjing, the meeting was temporarily postponed to the 16th. At the same time, the first French representative, Mr. Regard, telegraphed to Shanghai, urging Gregerin to come to Nanjing to facilitate the meeting as scheduled. According to a certain gentleman, a representative from our side, the French side is indeed sincere in resolving the reorganization of the French Concession Law Court. If progress is swift, it can be resolved in two or three meetings. As for the form of resolution, it is roughly the same as the Mixed Court in the Public Concession. Regarding the name of the reorganized court, it is generally set as the Second District Court of the Shanghai Special District. At the same time, it is also planned to change the name of the Special District Court in the Public Concession to the First District Court of the Special District. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

Afterwards, photos were taken and the meeting adjourned. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has drafted regulations on short-term unified tax treasury bonds regarding the method of paying principal and interest. All bonds of 5,000 yuan and 1,000 yuan require the bondholder to have the original bond verified by the managing bank or managing office, record the principal and interest coupon, and receive the principal and interest. For bonds of 100 yuan and 10 yuan, the principal and interest coupon for that month should be detached and the principal and interest received. Regarding the method of deducting principal and interest, those who subscribe within June of the 20th year will hand over the coupon for the first period of principal and interest to the subscriber. Those who subscribe within July will detach the coupon for the first period of principal and interest, and then pay in cash, with each 100 yuan deducting the first period of principal. This will be noted on the pre-issued bond or receipt issued by the fundraising agency for separate issuance of the bond. The fundraising fee is set at one percent. Whether individuals or institutions, all those who raise funds and deposit them in the treasury will enjoy this benefit as an encouragement. However, if there are any remittance fees, etc., for depositing the funds, they must not be stipulated separately. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Large Army Concentrated in the Chechen Khanate</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to visitors from Outer Mongolia, all political affairs and powers in Outer Mongolia have been almost entirely seized by Soviet Russia. The government organization also imitates Soviet Russia. Recently, incited by the Russians, they have expanded their military preparations and are currently concentrating their forces in the Kerulen River basin in the Chechen Khanate. They have 30,000 infantry, 40,000 cavalry, 21 aircraft, various types of over-mountain mortars and other combat supplies. The military officers are all Russians and Buriats from Uriankhai. Residents of Inner Mongolia are quite uneasy. According to a certain prince of the Ordos League, since the death of the temporary president Da Lama Tserengdondov in the eighteenth year, the Russians have long been in charge of the Mongolian army's internal direction. Recently, seeing the success of a certain country in instigating the Dalai Lama to invade Kham, they are even more eager to try. The Chechen Khanate is a vital southeast point for Outer Mongolia, connecting the eastern three provinces in the east and bordering Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan to the south.

<p>(Peiping) A certain Mr. from Inner Mongolia recently arrived in Peiping and stated that the Outer Mongolian government is actively expanding its influence into Inner Mongolia.

<p>(Peiping) This morning, the Peiping General Chamber of Commerce convened representatives from various gentry and merchant associations to a meeting, resolving to go to the Hebei Finance Special Commissioner's Office tomorrow morning to hold a large petition, demanding the fundamental abolition of the production and sales tax. Over a hundred representatives participated. (Twelfth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Representatives from various county and city chambers of commerce in Hebei province issued a circular telegram on the twelfth, detailing the reasons for requesting the abolition of the production and sales tax. It stated that the likin tax was transformed into a consumption tax, and then into a production and sales tax, which is eliminating one evil but creating a hundred others. Moreover, the production and sales tax lacks explicit written approval from the Ministry of Finance and has not been discussed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan. Furthermore, it is not a uniformly applied tax law across the provinces. Such a production and sales tax, which hinders unification and violates laws and regulations, should be fundamentally abolished to save the thirty million merchants and people of Hebei from their suffering.

<p>Uchida and Eguchi to Succeed</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Dentus News Agency) - President Senge of the South Manchuria Railway Company has been ill for a long time. When former Prime Minister Hamaguchi was attacked, he had already expressed his intention to resign. Because he disagreed with Vice President Ohira, he did not want to entrust everything to Ohira after his resignation. In addition, many issues such as the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Showa Steel Works have not been resolved, and he wanted to resign after they were resolved. Therefore, he has delayed until now. Now, with his illness still showing no signs of improvement, he and Vice President Ohira have submitted their resignations one after another.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Dentus News Agency) - It has been decided that former Vice President Uchida Kōsai and former Mitsubishi Director Eguchi Sadazane will succeed as President and Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway Company. The Japanese government has given this matter deep consideration because the South Manchuria Railway Company has important diplomatic relations and requires someone with diplomatic skills and who is not related to political parties, so as to avoid the pattern of progress being affected by the changes in the cabinet as in the past. Uchida possesses both of these qualifications.</p>

<p>Collecting Taxes, The Reason Being That the Sino-Russian Conference Has Not Yet Decided on a Treaty. Once Taxes Are Collected (Russia Can Use It as an Excuse to Say That China Has Recognized Its Resumption of Trade, and Can Then Transport Goods to China in Large Quantities.) Currently, Several Train Cars Are Loaded Every Week and Distributed to Various Stations, Large and Small, Where They Are Sold Directly on the Trains. When Asked, They Claim to Be a Mobile Consumer Cooperative. However, the Purpose of the Eastern Railway Consumer Cooperative Is That, Except for Daily Necessities, They Are Not Allowed to Sell Other Items, and Are Not Allowed to Sell to Non-Railway Employees. Now, No Questions Are Asked, and Fearing That Non-Railway Employees Will Not Buy, Personnel Are Sent to Advertise Everywhere When Goods Arrive at Each Station, Soliciting Chinese and Foreign People to Board the Train and Purchase. Because the Goods Are Not Taxed and Do Not Bear Eastern Railway Shipping Costs, They Are Sold at Low Prices, and Sales Are Very Brisk. Every Week, At Least Every Small Station Can Sell One Train Car, and Large Stations Two or Three Train Cars. As a Result, Local Stores Are Greatly Affected. The Harbin Consumer Cooperative is also particularly active. Therefore, All Major Department Stores, Such as Tong Fa Long, Gong He Li, Fu He Chang, and Heng Shun Chang, Are Affected. In Order to Prevent Future Harm, the Merchants Recently Appealed to the General Chamber of Commerce, Requesting That It Be Forwarded to the Government to Prohibit Russian Merchants from Engaging in Activities Under False Names. In addition, the Special Zone Businessmen's Association Also Held a General Meeting A Few Days Ago, Resolving to Petition the Government Against the Revival of the Eastern Railway Consumer Cooperative. The Authorities Have Already Sent a Letter to Diplomatic Commissioner Zhong Yu, Asking Him to Negotiate With the Russian Consul in Harbin. It Is Also Heard That the Soviet Russian Government Stipulates That All Red Railway Employees Serving the Eastern Railway Must Use One-Quarter of Their Salary Each Month for Living Expenses, One-Quarter for Party Dues, and the Remaining Two-Quarters to Expand the Funding of the Mobile Consumer Cooperative, With More Than 1.7 Million Available Each Month, So Their Strength Is Quite Strong.

<h3 id="e80">Tobacco Seedlings Everywhere in Suxian County <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Numerous Soil Trading Firms in Various Townships</p>
<p>The Government Actually Collects Taxes for Protection</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondent, Southern Xuzhou is Adjacent to Northern Anhui. Suxian, Haoling, and Wo Counties in Anhui Province have always been famous for producing tobacco. Now is the time when tobacco seedlings are harvested in large quantities, and many people go to Suxian County to buy fresh soil. According to investigations, there are numerous soil trading firms in Suxian County, mostly in important townships, openly collecting taxes. The method of tax payment is annual, ranging from ten to twenty yuan per plot. The tax money is collected by the district chiefs of each district and turned over to the authorities. Soil trading firms collect three percent from both buyers and sellers of raw tobacco, making huge profits, and they are protected by the government. Approximately, there are fifteen soil trading firms in Xiezhuang, eight in Luji, eight in Baichu, six in Langanshan, twenty in Minxian Village, five in Jiagouzhi, thirty in Shicun, fifteen in Wangji, ten in Yinji, sixteen in Kantun, twenty-five in Lutun, nine in Zhichengzi, fifteen in Daozhuang, and eighteen in Xiaqiao. Other less important villages and towns also have three to several firms each. This is truly shocking. As for the places where tobacco is grown, they are everywhere you look. Ordinary residents with fifty mu of land will use twenty mu to grow tobacco. This is because each mu of good land can yield 140 to 150 taels of tobacco, while each mu of poor land can yield 50 to 60 taels of tobacco. The minimum price of tobacco is about one yuan per tael. And growing one hundred mu of tobacco can be reported as forty or fifty mu. The tax on each mu of tobacco seedlings is set at fifty yuan. Based on profit calculations, many people are happy to grow it. However, this year, the official tobacco seedling tax is set at one hundred yuan per mu, and most growers oppose it. Currently, the district and township chiefs are petitioning the province for instructions on how to proceed. It is said that the tobacco growing situation in various counties in northern Anhui is roughly the same as in Suxian County. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Fine Qin and Han Bricks and Tiles Have Been Seized by the Japanese <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Entire Collection of Bricks and Tiles is Worth Only 2,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondent, After the entire collection of Qin and Han bricks and tiles, the only national treasure collected by the Gao family of Weixian County, was bought by the Japanese, it was detained by the Jiaoji Railway Bureau when passing through Qingdao. The railway bureau and the Qingdao municipal government jointly sealed the antiques and sent police to guard them day and night to prevent accidents. However, although the Law on the Preservation of Antiques has been drafted by the central government, it has not yet been officially promulgated and implemented. Therefore, the Department of Education telegraphed the Ministry of Education for instructions, and the Jiaoji Railway Bureau also requested instructions from the Ministry of Railways, and forwarded them to the Ministry of Education and the Executive Yuan for handling. However, according to recent confirmed investigations, the essence of the Qin and Han bricks and tiles has been seized by the Japanese. According to a gentleman in Qingdao who learned from the Japanese, this collection of bricks and tiles was purchased by Ota, a famous Japanese antique dealer. Kuhara, who is currently in charge of negotiations, is a transportation agent and also a small Japanese antique dealer. After Ota bought it, he took the best two Qin bricks back to his country. These two are Qin twelve-character bricks, which are the best of the Qin and Han bricks and tiles. The Shandong Provincial Library once had a rubbing of this brick. According to the hall style, the brick is inscribed with twelve characters: "All within the seas are subjects, the years bring abundant harvests, and there are no hungry people." The brick is square, approximately eight inches in length, width, and height. The brick is stored in a wooden box, with the words written by Wang Yirong. The original text reads: "The twelve characters are all from the words of Zhuan Hansheng, designated as Qin leg, Mr. Weng Ge said that the era is determined by the characters. I am planning to use this sentence to congratulate the present family of heaven, Yi Rong Ji." According to the text, "Jun" is a Ding rhyme character, "Zhuan" is an ancient brick character, and Hansheng is the son of Gao Qingling. This box was made by Gao Hansheng, and Gao Hansheng also wrote a poem himself and attached it to it. The value of its nobleness can be imagined. The one currently detained in Qingdao is still a twelve-character brick, which is also a supreme treasure. The total price of all the bricks and tiles is 2,500 yuan. Gong, the negotiator, received 900 yuan, and the Gao family received no more than 1,600 yuan. It is regrettable to sell the only national treasure for this meager amount of money. (10th)</p>

<p>The Groom Falls to the Ground at the Wedding Sedan The groom, Sheng Youzi of Sheng Zaimao Flower Village, Shitou River, North of Shengzi Temple, married Zhang, a woman from Xitan, Songjiang, for his son Buchan yesterday. Sheng has always been stubborn, so all the wedding ceremonies were in accordance with customs. In addition to setting up an incense table in the hall to pay homage to heaven and earth, before the wedding sedan arrived at the door, he ordered the groom to go outside the city to greet it, emphasizing the importance of the ceremony. Unexpectedly, upon returning to the hall, the groom suddenly vomited blood and fell unconscious. Immediately, the whole family was in panic and at a loss. Superstitious people said that he had offended the flower powder deity and asked for prayers. The Sheng family also believed that the time was conflicting and beat the astrologer who had chosen the day, causing his head to bleed and almost causing a major disaster. Fortunately, his relative Huang hired Dr. Xu Tianxiang to give acupuncture treatment and wake him up. However, Sheng believed that the auspicious time had passed and the wedding was not completed, so he specially rescheduled the wedding for today to show perfection.</p>

<p>Party and Government Agencies Mediate Fire Disputes In Ni Chunji's carpentry shop behind Chen Baitou Alley on Tonghui Road in this city, a fire broke out suddenly and unexpectedly at 10:30 on the evening of the 11th, causing a conflagration. In an instant, the fire was blazing, and it was impossible to approach it. Nearby residents rang gongs to warn the police. After hearing the police, the Zhoushanbang Fire Brigade of this area immediately drove the dragon to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire, but the fire was too fierce and the effort was of little help. Because the other fire brigades inside and outside the city had opinions with the Zhongnan Grand Theater, the captains of each team published a joint announcement in the local newspaper, unanimously resigning from their respective associations. As there has not yet been a proper solution, all the fire brigades did not drag the dragon out to put out the fire, which caused the fire to spread, burning for two hours. Seventy or eighty thatched huts were burned to ashes, with a loss of about 4,500 yuan. When the fire was raging, the crying of the distressed thatched households was deafening, and the situation was very pitiful. Unexpectedly, at about 10 o'clock yesterday morning, a fire broke out suddenly in the Hou family's firewood room on Yingshan River in the city.

<p>Huaiyin's pig tax and police donations are due to competition, and a small number of pig merchants went to the province to petition for cancellation. The Civil Affairs Department once rejected the request, and involved the Public Security Bureau in detaining ships and escorting people. The County Government reported the facts to the Civil Affairs Department, stating that the pig tax collection was in accordance with the Department's orders and approved the original plan for implementation, and that the county had instructed the collection of donations and that the detention of ships was not true. As for the case of Chen Ruyi assaulting the police, it was another matter and has been handled according to judicial procedures. The Civil Affairs Department replied and ordered the merchants to quickly return to the county to discuss the payment methods, stating that the merchant donations and public security funds should be taken into account, and there was no need to bother the province any further. Ye Daxing and other pig farms have agreed to the original amount with the County Government and will continue to pay monthly to resolve the dispute.</p>

<p>A Bizarre Murder Occurred Outside the City In the Taiping Gang Alley in Hebei, outside Huaiyin City, the Lu Kai Rong family rented a house to Wu Yin Hou, a resident of Daxing Village in this county, through the introduction of Jiang Fengke. Yin Hou returned to Daxing Village on the 3rd of this month to harvest wheat, leaving his wife Shi in the residence. On the evening of the 7th, two farmers known to Shi went to stay overnight, claiming that they had come from the countryside to Pu to sell pigs and had not had time to return. Gu, Kai Rong's mother, did not want to let them stay overnight because the two people were of unknown origin. Shi said that they were acquaintances, so Gu was reluctant to refuse. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 AM, Gu heard Wu's children crying non-stop. When she went to check, she saw that the people who had stayed overnight had left, and Wu's wife Shi's face was covered in blood. Only then did she realize that she had been killed. She immediately woke up her son Kai Rong and reported it to the Public Security Bureau. The bureau dispatched a patrol officer to investigate and placed the Lu mother and son under surveillance. Another guard, Zhang Yu, was called to guard the body. On the 8th, they went to the county to report and asked for an examination. As for Wu Yin Hou, he had not returned to the residence by the afternoon of the 8th. It is unknown how this bizarre murder will end.</p>

<p>Yesterday's results were mediocre overall. Specialized schools have less time for practice. The highlight was the 1500-meter final.

In the first 200 meters, Zhang was in front, followed by Ma. At 400 meters, Ma accelerated to catch up. At 600 meters, Zhang was again in front. At 800 meters, Ma caught up again. At 1000 meters, Zhang ran in front. In the final lap, Zhang sprinted hard, and Ma's pursuit was ineffective, falling behind by 50 meters. The result of 4 minutes and 31 seconds was excellent.</p>

<p>The China National Products United Department Store was ordered to close by the工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council). The situation has now expanded. Yesterday, both the Taxpayers' Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council) to question them. The negotiation committee and support association organized by the department store have also been formally established, and the industrial, commercial, and academic circles are unanimously providing assistance. The External Affairs Office and the National Goods Exhibition Hall have all sent personnel to investigate the truth. The situation yesterday is recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Party Headquarters News <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Municipal Executive Committee's Attention: The Municipal Party Headquarters regards promoting national goods as one of the party's seven movements, and national goods are a powerful weapon to block the annual outflow of 120 million. Today, the imperialists are deeply afraid that economic aggression will be severely hit, so they have taken preemptive measures, even ordering the police to seal it off, which is considered to be despising Chinese merchants and infringing on national rights. Therefore, it was brought up for discussion at the 115th Standing Committee meeting yesterday. It was resolved to send a letter to the Municipal Government to seriously negotiate with the authorities of the Public Concession. (2) Declaration of the Third District Party Headquarters: The Third District Party Headquarters issued a declaration yesterday, which said: (The above omitted. This city's China National Products Department Store is the hub for promoting national goods. Recently, it has been envied by the British police, who have used false pretexts and illegal means to close it down and beat up employees. Upon hearing this, we are deeply indignant. The imperialists rely on the development of science and the progress of machinery to use surplus goods as the only strategy for economic aggression against China. The establishment of the National Products Department Store fundamentally conflicts with this kind of aggression. The police under the rule of the British imperialists do not hesitate to use the licensing issue of the amusement part of the department store as a pretext to illegally close it down. The place has been a New World amusement park for many years, and the relocation of the National Products Department Store has not even been a旬(ten days). If it is said that the equipment is not complete or the building is not solid, and it is closed down, then why was a license issued when the New World amusement park was opened, and why was it closed down only on the day the National Products Department Store opened? Moreover, the department store is located downstairs, while the amusement part is upstairs. If it is believed that the amusement part has not been licensed, so it is closed down as a reason, then it is only necessary to stop or close down the amusement part. Why must the department store part be involved? After repeated consideration, it is impossible not to think that there is another intention. Moreover, the insults to employees and the arbitrary arrests fully reveal the hideous faces of the imperialists. However, within our national territory, allowing them to be so barbaric is simply unthinkable. The occurrence of this incident happens to be seven days after the inauguration of the Chinese consultants and Chinese members of the Municipal Council in the Public Concession, which gives us a great lesson, making us realize that the piecemeal solution is not reliable, and the policy of bargaining with the imperialists is not advisable. We should follow the spirit of the General's fearlessness, follow the instructions of the National Assembly, and work together for the abolition of the treaties, so that the whole problem can be solved once and for all. In addition to leading all party members in the district to expand publicity, this association hereby declares, for your information.)</p>
<h3 id="e142">Attention from the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry believes that the Shanghai National Goods Department Store was founded by Zhang Zilian and others by raising shares and has been in business for more than a year. In the market in Shanghai where foreign goods are flooded, the department store only sells domestic products, which is closely related to the promotion of domestic products. Now, for what reason it was closed, the truth is unknown. In addition to telegraphing the Industrial and Commercial Visiting Bureau, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, together with the Chinese Taxpayers Association and the Chinese directors, to find ways to help, it also believes that the 工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council)'s closure of the Shanghai department store is related to diplomacy and has代(on behalf of) telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the ministry's Shanghai office be notified to investigate and handle it immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Official Investigation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent representatives to the China National Goods Department Store the day before yesterday to request assistance, in addition to reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for consideration and requesting instructions, yesterday, Director Yang also sent staff member Tang Ruxuan to investigate both sides based on reports from various parties to determine the truth, so that it could be submitted to the ministry for reference. In addition, Dong Keren, curator of the National Goods Exhibition Hall in this city, believes that this matter is closely related to the future of domestic products. Yesterday, he also personally went to various parties to investigate the truth so that he could report it to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and propose serious negotiations.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, which read: "Dear Sirs, on the 11th of this month, we received a letter from the China National Products United Department Store stating that they founded the China National Products United Department Store on Nanjing Road in Shanghai in July of last year. In May of this year, they moved the department store to the west side of Jing'an Temple Road and continued to operate as usual. Unexpectedly, at 3 p.m. on June 9, the Public Concession police suddenly sent police officers to order the business to stop, locking all the doors of the entire venue and sending police to monitor and prevent entry and exit. Zhang Zian and Liu Musu, employees of the three-week cotton weaving factory, were beaten up by the doormen when they came to the venue for business. Department store employees Wang Jianxin and Hua Zusheng were arrested and detained in the police station when they went out. Even the people who brought meals were prevented from bringing rice into the venue. Our chamber of commerce was unable to resist under the pressure of force and had to suspend business. We are now sending a letter to inform you of the process and ask for your assistance. The department store is renting the old site of the New World. After renting the site, the department store has used part of the hall as a department store and the rest as an amusement area, with separate managers responsible for each. According to your bureau's regulations, amusement parks must have a license, while department stores do not need to obtain a license. This time, because the equipment and facilities of the amusement department did not meet the instructions of your bureau, the so-called suspension of business should also be limited to the amusement department. The department store's business people have repeatedly stated that the gates of Jing'an Temple and Tibet Road are merchant's gates. Why should they be closed together, so that the department store cannot operate? Our association believes that this kind of disposal exceeds the scope of what it should be and deliberately obstructs Chinese merchants' business. We should ask you to immediately instruct the police department to open the department store for the restoration of business. We are specially submitting this letter for your information, and we ask you to investigate and deal with it accordingly."</p>

<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the General Manager of the工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council) yesterday, which read: "Dear Sirs, according to reports, your bureau sent police to close the gates of the China National Products United Department Store and prevent business operations. Our association hereby asks your bureau if this kind of emergency disposition has been approved by the主管(supervising) court and according to what legal procedures. We are responding to send a letter to you for your investigation and request that you immediately restore the department store to its original state in order to maintain its business operations and that you clearly answer the above questions."</p>

<p>The First Branch of the Citizens' United Association convened an emergency committee meeting at 10 a.m. yesterday, chaired by Zhou Juchen, and resolved: (1) Send a letter to the工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council) to reply quickly as to why the National Products Department Store was closed. (2) After receiving a reply, convene a citizens' meeting to solicit opinions. (3) Hold a dinner party on the 17th to discuss the measures first. The letter to the工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council) is recorded below: "According to a letter from our member, the National Products United Department Store, stating that after our department store took over the New World at the east entrance of Jing'an Temple Road on May 1 and reorganized it into the National Products Department Store, unexpectedly, the工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council) suddenly sent armed Chinese and foreign detectives from the police station at 3 p.m. on the 9th of this month, without going through legal procedures, to seal all the doors of our department store, prohibit entry and exit, and detain employees, causing them to suffer innocently. We hereby request our association to uphold justice. According to this, our association does not know the truth. After all, how is it? We think your bureau is in charge of public security, and you should not rashly take actions to destroy citizens. We hope that you will give us a quick reply and clearly inform us of the reasons for the封(sealing). This is our earnest prayer." To the English Concession工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council).</p>

<p>The cigarette industry union, the publishing industry union, the cotton textile industry union, the postal workers' union, and the seafarers' union have initiated the organization of a support association for the National Products Department Store, which was formally established yesterday. An office has been set up, and a discussion meeting will be held at 12 noon today, convening representatives from more than 200 labor unions in the city to discuss everything and prepare to issue an important declaration and a letter to compatriots. In addition, the Chinese medicine industry and other trade associations also replied to the department store yesterday, expressing their willingness to be a backing.

(3) Depart immediately to Pudong, Hunan, Zhabei, and the four rural areas to spread the word and make the public understand the truth.</p>

<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association telegraphed for negotiations, which read: (Titles omitted) "On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, our association received a telegram from Wang Hanqiang, a member of the Standing Committee, stating that the China National Products United Department Store was suddenly ordered to close by the British patrol police at 3 p.m. today, and all the doors of the entire venue were sealed off, and police were sent to monitor and prevent entry and exit. The situation is severe, and we are asked to find ways to help. According to this, our association believes that the department store is jointly organized by the Chinese national goods industry and commerce comrades. Although they are determined to fight to the death against the economic aggression of the imperialists, this is a matter of business freedom and does not violate the law in any way. Moreover, at a time when the concession jurisdiction has been completely recovered by our country, the police dare to act freely and order the closure of a legitimate business department store. Such contempt for our national rights and disregard for our laws is intolerable to anyone with a human heart. We are specially sending this urgent telegram to you, begging you to quickly negotiate seriously to compensate for the losses, and you must immediately restore the department store's business operations so that it can proceed as usual. We are extremely frightened and await your orders, and we pray for your instructions to obey. It is really convenient for the party."

<p>The Nanjing Samsung Company telegraphed, "Most urgent, to all committee members and cadres of the China National Products United Department Store (transferred by Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, Nanjing Road, Shanghai), we are shocked to read in the newspaper that your department store has been closed down by the brutal and unreasonable imperialists, who have used their fierce hands and ordered the closure, and severely monitored and prohibited entry and exit, as if facing a formidable enemy. We are deeply angry. Promoting national goods is one of the seven movements prescribed by our Central Government. Your department store is carrying on the General's遗敎(teachings), implementing the Central Government's policies, and making every effort to promote national goods, fighting a desperate battle with economic aggressors, which is deeply admired. Unfortunately, you live under the iron hooves of the imperialists, so you can listen to them arbitrarily trampling and wantonly destroying. From this, we see the greatness of your department store, and it shows their baseness even more. This matter concerns the survival of the nation. We hope that you will uphold the spirit of fearlessness, be unyielding and indomitable, and not stop until the goal of victory is achieved. Do not let the foreigners call us 'Qin has no one.' Our company is not talented, but we vow to be a backing, and we will unite the national product manufacturers in Beijing to fight together, so that justice will ultimately prevail over power, and we will never allow this biggest stain to remain in national history. We first send a telegram to express our condolences, and we hope you will investigate and deal with it."</p>
<h3 id="e153">Letter from Zhang Meian <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Meian, Standing Committee member of the National Medicine Association, sent a letter to Zhang Zilian of the National Products Department Store yesterday, which read: "Recently, I read in the newspaper that the China National Products Department Store was suddenly closed by the British工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council) on the pretext of the license of the amusement department the day before yesterday, arbitrarily imposing the authority of imperialism without following legal procedures and arbitrarily detaining department store employees in an attempt to have their way. When the news came, the anger was the same. The British imperialists, in order to implement their ambition of economic aggression, are very jealous of Chinese merchants who sell domestic products in their concessions. They have been designing to destroy them for more than a day. Today, the China National Products Department Store, with the strong spirit of patriotic manufacturers, is conducting systematic and expanded publicity in its most prosperous concession area, and the impact is enough to fundamentally shake the entire strategy of British imperialist economic aggression. It is appropriate for them to be panic-stricken and expose their hideous faces, and have this barbaric action. Otherwise, the department store has not obtained an amusement license, and at most, it is enough to stop the performance of the amusement part. Why is it necessary to close the department store, and why should the employees of the department store be detained? As a citizen of the Great Chinese Republic and one of the Chinese taxpayers, I cannot remain silent in the face of the 工部局(The Shanghai Municipal Council)'s disregard for our national rights and oppression of our Chinese merchants, driven by my blood. I hope you will uphold your patriotism and hold the spirit of fearlessness, work hard and fight, negotiate according to reason, and never give up until the final victory is achieved, in order to uphold the people's spirit and achieve complete success. If I can do anything within my power, I will definitely help you."</p>

<p>Zhang Leshan and others sent a letter to the National Products Department Store, which read: "Dear Sirs, yesterday's newspaper reported that the British police forced your department store to close its doors and stop business for no reason and dared to insult employees. Leshan and others read it and felt unbearable pain and anger. This case has a great relationship with the international status and has an infinite impact on the future of national products. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Now Leshan and others are staying in Shanghai, just for the purpose of promoting national products. Suddenly encountering this misfortune is really extremely hateful. At present, we are uniting the factories in Anhui to provide considerable assistance and telegraphed to the merchants in Anhui and Wuhu to join the support, vowing to achieve the purpose of economic severance before stopping. "Do not return after a hundred setbacks and insist to the end." We are specially sending a letter to you for your information."

According to a certain Westerner, although the declaration has been submitted for discussion today, it was decided at that time that this declaration has not yet reached the time to be released, so it cannot be announced for the time being.</p>

<p>The National Tariff Commission believes that the establishment of tariffs is closely related to the prosperity and decline of various industries, but the advantages and disadvantages of which cannot be known to outsiders. In the past, when the government revised tariffs, merchants and the people could not participate in the opinions, and there were always malpractices in the implementation, which was not a way to protect commerce. The commission, in view of the past's faults, now plans to select personnel who are familiar with the business of various industries and tariffs, and give them salaries to study and安(settle). The vice chairman of the commission, Sheng Jun, went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday for this matter to ask for an introduction. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has transferred letters to the lacquer, fur, cigarette, Western seafood, native cloth, summer cloth, wood, and silk trade associations, asking them to find suitable talents on their behalf.

Currently, Liu's division is in the Yanping area, while Peng's bandits are entrenched in Shaowu, Guangze, and other places in southwestern Fujian Province. The armies are currently carrying out the suppression. When asked if it was true that the First Fleet would be led by Chen Jiliang to enter Fujian, he replied that it was not true.</p>

The American submarine Pigeon, under the order of Admiral Markwell, Commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, rushed to inspect the scene of the accident and arrived yesterday. The governments of the United States, France, Sweden, Spain, Greece, and other countries telegraphed condolences to the drowned soldiers.</p>
<p>Still Difficult to Confirm: A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Zhang of the Haichang Company, the agent of the Yu Da ship, yesterday and said that the owner of the Yu Da ship is the Japanese family Jiashi. There are more than 40 people on the ship, including the comprador, chief mate, old track, fireman, sailor, carpenter, and steel worker. Now, the company is inquiring from all parties and has not yet received any news. This time, it does not seem to be the Yu Da ship, or it may be that the Yu Da ship passed through the area and saw another ship colliding and sent a telegram for help on its behalf.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Zhang Zhijiang's Proclamation to Protect Religion and Secure the People <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>North of the Yangtze River, bordering the East China Sea, Christian churches are densely packed. There are often ignorant people who make things difficult for missionaries, and bandits and communists secretly cause disturbances. This has been heard by the Yangzhou Pacification Superintendent's Office, which has specially issued a lithographed proclamation, which is distributed to each church and handed over to the Shanghai Chinese Christian Association for distribution to various churches in the county. The original text is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Jiangsu Pacification Superintendent's Office Proclamation: For the purpose of proclamation, the purpose of missionary work lies in spreading relief and doing good with others, which is of great benefit to the world and people's hearts and is far from being comparable to general gatherings and associations. Therefore, the party platform of our party and the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China have special clauses on freedom of belief, and the true meaning of Christian love, equality, and freedom is admired by our Premier throughout his life. His revolutionary spirit of sacrifice and patriotism all originated from this. We are already under the banner of the Three Principles of the People of the Premier, and we should especially follow the legacy and earnestly abide by it to conform to the party platform and emphasize the Provisional Constitution. Recently, I have heard that there are ignorant people who often make things difficult for missionaries and evangelical churches, or take the opportunity to cause disturbances, or occupy them on the pretext. This is very wrong. Zhijiang is the pacification landlord, and his duties are related. He should give protection to the church. According to previous information, it should be proclaimed to the public, and all people from all walks of life should abide by it without violation. Zhang Zhijiang, Superintendent, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Silk Fabrics Must Be Certified Before Export <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Electrical Industry Association Requests Implementation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association believes that the export of electrical machinery and silk fabrics is of great importance to international credibility. Yesterday, it specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance, stating: "In order to maintain national products and emphasize international credibility, we request that silk fabric tax exports be certified by the association. We earnestly request your review and approval. Silk fabrics are our country's major products, and the people's livelihood depends on them. Since the development of the machinery industry, the electrical weaving factories in Shanghai have made great progress, setting a precedent for the country. The association was established several years ago, and it was reorganized in May of last year in accordance with the regulations. Each factory has joined the association in accordance with the regulations. In order to promote the national silk satin, the association urges the industry to improve the quality of manufacturing at any time, especially paying attention to the goods exported overseas. It is not easy to compete in the overseas market. Without excellent goods, how can we win international credibility? Since the National Government promulgated the regulations on tax exemption for silk fabrics, the government's intention to promote prosperity is even more evident. All merchants are ecstatic and will have further struggles in the overseas market. However, the Shanghai area is vast, and it is inevitable that there will be profiteers who reduce labor and steal materials in order to seek personal gain. As a result, the products are shoddy and the sizes are insufficient. Not only do they fail to live up to the government's encouragement, but the entire international credibility will be harmed. If we do not find a way to plan early, the harm will be unimaginable. The association has the responsibility to supervise and guide factories. Since we have something to see, we dare not be silent to the superiors. We propose that after the implementation of the tax exemption regulations, all electrical silk fabrics produced in Shanghai should first obtain certification from the association from the customs before being allowed to export tax-free, so as to avoid shoddy goods, loss of international credibility, and to maintain national products and prevent loopholes. It is for public convenience."</p>

<p>To Be Implemented From the 15th</p>

<h3 id="e174">Grain Stores Should Be Exempt From Business Tax <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Municipal Finance Bureau's Business Tax Preparation Office Yesterday, Stating: "Dear Sir, On the 11th of this month, we received a letter from the Municipal Rice Store Association, stating that our industry is a grain store merchant, and we have paid tooth tax and received a license to open a store. According to Article 20 of the draft regulations on business tax collection in the city, all existing donations and taxes in the city that are similar in nature to business shall be renamed business tax and shall be temporarily collected at the old tax rate. Furthermore, on the 7th of this month, it was reported that the Legislative Yuan passed the Business Tax Law, and Article 10 stipulates that the tooth tax, pawn tax, slaughter tax, and other business taxes that should be banned or strictly prohibited in accordance with the law in various provinces and cities may be temporarily changed to business tax at the original tax rate. Then, after the business tax is levied in the city, our industry's former tooth tax and license tax will undoubtedly be changed to business tax at the original tax rate. However, the tax rate passed by the city also lists a grain industry item, which collects 1/1000 of the business turnover. This seems to be redundant to the previous regulations. I don't know whether the 1/1000 tax rate for the grain industry belongs to the scope of grain store merchants who changed from the original tooth tax to business tax. We earnestly request that your office transfer to the Association for a detailed explanation as soon as possible so that there is something to follow." The association received the letter. According to Article 11 of the supplementary measures to the outline of the Ministry's determination of the collection of business tax in various provinces, the first step is to change the tax of tooth, pawn, slaughter, etc. to business tax and collect it at the original tax rate. It is stipulated that those who have paid the tooth tax and license tax will no longer be taxed separately for business tax. This is the regulation stipulated by the Ministry. Since Doumi Bank has already received a license to open a store and paid the tooth tax, it is a natural interpretation that it does not need to pay business tax anymore. The newly promulgated business tax regulations in this city have a grain industry listed in the sales business. The Doumi Bank, which has paid the tooth tax and license tax, should not be included in it. The association requests an explanation to dispel doubts and should send a letter to your office to investigate and show a reply, so as to transfer it. This is the most fortunate."</p>

<p>The Road and City Exhibition Conference hosted by the China National Road Construction Association is scheduled to open on September 12. Representatives from Guizhou Province, such as Hua Laifeng, have already arrived in Shanghai and are planning to decorate the province's exhibits. The consulate in Penang specially inquired about the opening date yesterday so as to urge the machine manufacturers to prepare as soon as possible. The exhibits collected by the Busan consulate have been delivered. He Yongyueling, acting secretary of the Finnish Embassy, sent a letter to the association yesterday, saying, "On May 9 of this year, we approved the association's letter of April 18, instructing the embassy to collect all the latest design projects, books, tables, and ancient monuments within the scope of road and city transportation, and the roads and bridges repaired in the past and present in the scenic areas, urban parks, etc., large and small architectural photos, models, and exhibits such as road construction, road maintenance, and transportation vehicles and tankers newly invented by famous factories, with detailed instructions, and transport them to the conference for exhibition. We hereby approve that we have obtained two packages of road standard drawings and bridge drawings and a booklet of cabinet resolutions from the Finnish Ministry of Transportation, and we have also purchased many books. However, various models cannot be obtained, so we have to leave them out. We are preparing to send a document, and we have received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs conveying the purpose of your association's collection. We will prepare a list of the collected items and send them to your association for verification and reply. As for the books purchased by the embassy, which cost 300 Finnish marks, the association should have repaid them. However, it is difficult to exchange money from China to Finland. The embassy has spent them from public funds. The above books will be presented to the association for display."</p>

<p>The Taxpayers' Association Sent Another Letter to the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association, for the Public Works Department's collection of police donations, should notify the taxpayers in advance more than 14 days in advance. Yesterday, it sent another letter to the Public Works Department, saying, "Dear Sir, Before the collection of all municipal general donations, we believe that the principle of equal treatment has been followed, and all taxpayers have been notified in writing, allowing a 14-day grace period. However, the association has repeatedly received reports from taxpayers, saying that they have not received the above-mentioned written notice, and personnel from your bureau have gone to collect donations, etc. In the association's opinion, your bureau has repeatedly declared that there is no discriminatory treatment among taxpayers, then the 14-day advance notice must have been handled uniformly, otherwise, would it not be a real evidence of discriminatory treatment? Therefore, the association firmly believes that your bureau is not insincere, and the above-mentioned report may be due to the negligence of the delivery person of your bureau. We should send a letter, hoping to check and give us a true reply." Sincerely, Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Tax Rules Meeting Requested Exemption From the Seal Bamboo Shoot Tooth Tax <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of the Municipal Industry Association sent a letter to the Finance Bureau yesterday requesting approval to exempt the seal bamboo shoot industry from the tooth tax, saying, "Dear Sir, According to the letter from the seal bamboo shoot industry association, the tooth tax has been followed from the old view of the late Qing Dynasty. The origin of its tax rules is actually similar to the business tax rules. At this time of reform of public administration, all harsh and miscellaneous donations are being exempted everywhere. If each industry's business must be licensed, that is the evidence of business. If we collect tooth tax again, it is inevitable that it is repeated. Moreover, such as our seal bamboo shoot industry, in recent years, most of them are self-releasing Zhuangke to purchase from Fujian, which is actually a kind of transportation of local goods and is not a temporary commission. We should be exempted from the item of tooth tax, etc. "According to this, we found that the industry's business is purely for transportation and is very different from the intermediary merchants who set up lines to collect commissions. There is no need to pay for a job. Moreover, the newly promulgated business tax rate in the city also has an item of seal bamboo shoot industry tax of 1/1000. It is also necessary to remove the tooth tax to avoid one industry and two taxes. The letter from the previous letter should be given to your bureau to approve the exemption of the industry's tooth tax, so as to avoid double taxation and maintain commerce. This is the most grateful." Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry notified various agencies and businesses on the 2nd that the Shanghai Office would be abolished at the end of this month and merged with the Nanjing Trademark Bureau. The general business felt inconvenient. The Ministry of Industry has been petitioning to continue to maintain the Shanghai Bureau in order to facilitate commercial difficulties. Recently, foreign lawyer He Lemang, because he represents foreign merchants in handling many trademark cases, specially wrote to Director Wen of the Shanghai Office, saying, "Dear Sir, We have recently received your bureau's notification of June this year, saying that the Shanghai Branch of the Trademark Bureau will be abolished at the end of this month, and that the branch will stop working after the 15th, etc. After receiving the notification, this office is very worried, because the Shanghai Branch is very convenient for the general merchants, and it serves a large number of merchants related to trademarks. Once it is abolished, it will be very inconvenient. I think the director knows that Shanghai is the commercial center of the country. In fact, almost no trademark is used in China that is not related to Shanghai. Now, your bureau's general agency is located in the capital, which is justified, but the Shanghai branch provides many conveniences for the general people's trademark registration, and it is urgent to abolish this agency. It is really confusing. The Birch Office handles many trademark cases, and the various merchants also unanimously request your bureau to approve the continued maintenance of the Shanghai branch. I hope that you will carefully review our office's request as being justified and for public convenience."</p>

The chairman was Zhang Yichen. The meeting proceeded as usual. (A) Reporting Matters: (1) Last session's motions, (2) Reporting of incoming letters from various parties completed. (B) Start of Discussion: (1) The Jing'an Temple National Products Shopping Mall was forced to close its doors and stop business by the Public Concession Police on the 9th of this month, who sent Chinese and Western detectives to oppress it with imperialist means, arrest employees, despise legal rights, and destroy national products. We should uphold justice. After Ju Zilian detailed the actual situation, he intentionally made things difficult. If we do not fight, how can we imagine the future of national product promotion? I hope to give assistance. Then, the various committee members successively stated their assistance propositions, and their words were all impassioned. Resolution: Approved to give assistance. First send a letter to the Public Works Department, asking it to give a detailed reply, and then proceed. (2) Assistance to Gu Jingen. Resolution: Zhang Xianfang was nominated as a representative to participate. (3) The district branches that have been approved should be prepared for establishment as soon as possible to focus on the association's affairs. Resolution: All district branches must be established within this month. Next, the association discussed the methods of proceeding with affairs, and the meeting place will be moved to the west side of the first floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce starting next week to work as usual.</p>

<p>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to Convene Mediation Today</p>
<p>The Guanghua Machinery Dyeing Factory on Luban Road in this city, due to the reinstatement of worker Zhu Linhou, has stirred up the anger of the workers, resulting in the assault of factory manager Gu Yongquan. The factory was forced to announce a temporary shutdown. Since the day before yesterday, all 300-plus workers have been living inside the factory, guarding the factory gate. Yesterday, the factory reported the manager's injury to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for investigation and reported to the nearby police station to maintain order. The Public Security Bureau, considering the workers' guarding of the factory gate to be inappropriate, dispatched police to arrest seventeen workers, including Yan A'er. The labor union has scheduled a general membership meeting for tomorrow to discuss everything and has invited party and government organs to send personnel for guidance. The Social Affairs Bureau, recognizing that the strike has expanded and seeking a swift resolution, has scheduled a meeting for 8:00 a.m. today to question both labor and management in order to proceed with mediation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Physicians' Association and the Chinese Medical Association received a letter yesterday from the Municipal Health Bureau stating: "Regarding the French Concession's implementation of physician registration, many of the established regulations are improper. This Bureau has repeatedly made serious representations and has obtained the following substantial results: (1) Only one license fee of two yuan is required. (2) Physicians who do not reside or have clinics within the concession and hold formal documents from this Bureau may make outpatient visits within the French Concession without having to register or obtain a license from the French Concession." When this Bureau negotiated with the French Concession, it proposed supplementary measures to prevent unqualified doctors from passing themselves off as qualified, namely, that all physicians should photograph their certificates and this Bureau's business registration license in six-inch film to be carried with them when making outpatient visits to the French Concession for inspection by French Concession inspectors at any time. However, this Bureau is deeply concerned that such films could easily be faked and is instead using a small, easy-to-carry license. All physicians who already have a physician's certificate and this Bureau's business registration license can bring a two-inch, half-body photograph of themselves to this Bureau to obtain a small photo, completely free of charge, except for the one-cent stamp duty that must be paid. Physicians who have not obtained a business registration license may obtain a small photo when obtaining a business registration license. This Bureau is currently rushing to produce these small photos, and a letter will be sent to inform you when they are ready for collection. This letter is sent first for your information."</p>

<p>To Be Distributed Today</p>
<p>Railway police on the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways will receive a half-month bonus for 1930. It was originally promised to be issued in May but has not yet been received. Therefore, the Wusong Machine Factory and the railway labor unions jointly submitted a request to superiors the day before yesterday for prompt distribution. It is now learned that the railway police departments sent telegrams to all sections of the railway yesterday, requesting the submission of lists to the bureau for verification and distribution. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the chiefs of the Beishang, Shangnan, Hangyong, Suzhen, and other police sections: Pursuant to the bureau's order to issue a half-month bonus to railway workers for 1930, approved by the ministry, it must be delayed until railway funds are slightly more abundant before it can be arranged for distribution. Each police section should quickly create and send to this section a list of the half-month bonus receipts for each police officer by the cold day (i.e., before the 14th) for forwarding for verification and distribution. Important." It is heard that the workers in the railway machine and engineering departments also received telegrams on the same day, causing all workers and police to be overjoyed and work with peace of mind. It is expected that distribution will take place around the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>To Be Distributed in Zones Immediately</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society, considering the severity of the disaster in Mianchi, Henan, allocated 55,000 yuan for relief. The number of people is too large to provide relief to everyone, so it has been changed to distributing relief grain, which can save more people, as reported previously. Now, a report has been received from Feng Yangshan, director of relief in the county, stating that millet was purchased in Zhengzhou for 30 catties per yuan, green beans for 28 catties per yuan, mung beans for 28 catties per yuan, and wheat for 29 catties per yuan, which is about half the price in Mianchi. 190 tons have been purchased, worth about 14,000 yuan, transported by cart to Mianchi, and have now arrived in Mianchi. They will be immediately transported to the three disaster areas in the east, south, and west for distribution. Once this distribution is complete, the most severely affected areas in the north will be investigated for effective relief. With the grain price being much cheaper than in Mianchi, the number of people saved can be doubled. With this, the disaster victims can temporarily alleviate their current living conditions. Director Feng's previous letter stated that the society has withdrawn 22,000 yuan from the Bank of China in Zhengzhou, which the society has now remitted to the Bank of China in this city.</p>

<p>Following a report from representatives of disaster victims from Shouxian and Fengtai in Anhui Province, stating that Zhang Xiangkun, the magistrate of Shouxian County, had removed the dam outside the north gate, resulting in 60 li of land at the intersection of the two counties being flooded. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., a disaster relief meeting was specially held at the Anhui Fellow Townsmen's Association, attended by more than sixty people including Shi Yukun. Hong Ding was publicly elected as chairman, and the meeting was conducted as planned. Subsequently, Wang Ji and other representatives of the disaster victims reported on the situation of the disaster. The fellow townsmen present were extremely indignant. The Shanghai Shoufeng Fellow Townsmen's Public Welfare Association was immediately established, and nineteen people, including Shi Yukun, were elected as executive committee members. Subsequently, Hong Ding, Shi Yukun, Hu Liansan, Jiang Pinzhi, Zhu Yuqiao, Yu Junfu, Wang Wenxu, Wang Zhuru, and Lu Dongwu were elected as standing committee members. Resolutions: (1) Request the provincial government to dismiss and punish Zhang Xiangkun and send personnel to investigate the disaster area in order to plan for the aftermath. (2) Report to the Control Yuan the situation of Zhang Xiangkun's dereliction of duty and harming the people. (3) Request the Relief Committee to allocate funds for disaster relief. (4) Send letters to fellow townsmen in various cities to launch a joint condemnation. (5) Send letters of condolence to the disaster victims in Shoufeng. (6) Notify the various agencies in Shoufeng of the association's handling of the situation. A temporary motion was made to prepare for the establishment of the Shanghai Shoufeng Fellow Townsmen's Association, with the welfare association committee members serving as the preparatory committee members, using 41 Malong Road as the preparation office.</p>

<p>Negotiations Unlikely to Escalate</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River ship Jianghua, after leaving the dock for repairs at the Jiangnan Shipyard on the 28th of last month, sailed to Pucheng in Xinkai River and encountered the Dada Company's Yamato entering the port and anchoring to turn around. Due to the rapid rising tide, the two ships collided, as reported previously. It is now learned that both parties have submitted reports from their captains as a basis for negotiation, but each party holds a different opinion, and no results have been achieved. Yesterday, Yang Qingbang, the shipping director of Dada Company, stated that he had personally gone to the China Merchants Bureau the day before yesterday (the 2nd) to negotiate with Zeng Guangqing, the chief of the shipping department, who replied that the Jianghua is currently on duty, and the issue of responsibility will be handled after the Jianghua returns to Shanghai and the two captains have been questioned. Moreover, the damage on both sides is very minor, and out of friendship between fellow businesses, the negotiations are unlikely to escalate.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Distributing Reactionary Leaflets <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Offenders Sentenced Separately</p>
<p>The Communist Party members Tang Shaoji, Zhou Li'an, Gu Hanliang, Yang Shichang, Lu Jinshui, etc., on the evening of the other day, under the guise of watching a movie in a certain cinema in the French Concession, distributed reactionary leaflets and set off firecrackers. The theater staff discovered this and reported it to the police, who ordered detectives to go to the scene, arrest Tang and others, and confiscate the leaflets. Communist Party books were also confiscated from Tang's residence and brought to the police station. Suspects Zhou Zhilian, Zhou Rongchu, Wang Weicheng, etc., were subsequently arrested. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Court for investigation. The police chief first went to the court, explained the situation, and presented the confiscated leaflets and books. Subsequently, Fan Quangen and other tea boys from the theater went to the court to testify about the defendants' distribution of leaflets. When questioned, Tang Shaoji confessed that Zhao, who is at large, had indeed instigated the people to distribute reactionary leaflets in the cinema. Zhou Li'an, Gu Hanliang, and Yang Shichang also confessed. The people stated that although they went to the cinema to watch a movie, they did not know about the distribution of leaflets. The judge asked, "If you did not distribute leaflets, why were Communist books found in your residence?" Zhou and the others were speechless. Lu Jinshui stated that the people went to the cinema with Yang Shichang on that day and knew that they were distributing leaflets, but the people did not participate and asked for leniency. Zhou Zhilian, Zhou Rongchu, and Wang Weicheng all stated that although the people knew Tang and the others, they did not know about the distribution of leaflets. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Tang Shaoji to two years in the Western Prison, Zhou Li'an, Gu Hanliang, and Yang Shichang to one year each, and Lu to six months. Upon completion of their terms, all will be permanently expelled from the concession. Zhou Zhilian and the other three were permanently deported. The confiscated leaflets and books were all confiscated.</p>

<h3 id="e197">The Son of Paint Merchant Wang Zhengguo, Wang Ruibao, Was Kidnapped Yesterday <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Involving the Chinese, British, and French Concessions</p>
<p>Student Kidnapped by Fake Automobile</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around six o'clock, a case of bandits hijacking a car and kidnapping a primary school student suddenly occurred. The location of the incident is related to the Chinese, British, and French concessions. The bandits rented a car on Zhapu Road in the Public Concession, the hostage lived on Zhonghua Road in the Chinese area, and the kidnapping took place near Xinqiao Street in the French Concession. The detailed process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Ruibao's School Time, Wang Zhengguo, a wealthy paint merchant from Ningbo, nearly fifty years old, resides at 1451 Zhonghua Road in the Chinese area. He has a son named Ruibao, who is sixteen years old and is a fourth-grade student in the primary school department of the Qianye Middle School on Tiemalu, Penglu Road in the Public Concession. He must go to school at seven o'clock every morning, rain or shine.</p>
<p>Male and Female Hired a Car Yesterday morning at six o'clock, a well-dressed man and woman, seemingly a couple, suddenly came to Zhongshan Automobile Co., Ltd. at 295 Zhapu Road. The woman was holding a baby in her arms and said that they needed to hire a car to send them to Xietu Road in the Chinese area near Avenue Albert in the French Concession. The company's cashier ordered the car driver Wang Youfu to drive a No. 12604 city number 864 covered car to the address.</p>
<p>Xietu Road Payment Situation The car driver Wang Youfu drove the car to Avenue Albert, then straight south through Xujiahui Road, over the bridge from Meixie Road, and straight to Xietu Road. At a remote place, the passengers ordered the car to stop. Then, they took out two silver dollars from their pockets and ordered the car driver to give change. The driver replied that he did not carry change. The passengers nodded and told the driver to get out of the car and follow them to get the money. The driver obeyed and got out of the car.</p>
<p>Car Driver's Detention Time After the driver got out of the car, two burly men suddenly jumped out from the roadside, each showing a pistol, and flanked him from the left and right, prohibiting him from making a sound. Threatened by their power, the driver had no way to resist, so he followed the two men into the nearby wilderness, while the car renters themselves acted as drivers, turned the car around, and sped away as if flying, disappearing in an instant. Later, the driver was detained for about an hour before being released.</p>
<p>Stop the Car and Wait for the Hostage After being released, the car driver immediately ran to report to the Public Security Bureau. At this time, the bandits had already obtained the car and were waiting near the Siming Guild Hall in the French Concession, waiting for the hostage to come.</p>
<p>The Little Hostage is Still Missing Yesterday morning at six-thirty, Wang Zhengguo's son, Ruibao, took his own chartered car to school. Unexpectedly, when he arrived near the Siming Guild Hall on Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, four bandits suddenly came, showed pistols, grabbed Ruibao from the chartered car, and dragged him to a car parked on the side of the road, which flew away. Seeing his young master being kidnapped, the driver of the chartered car couldn't help but panic and ran back to report to the owner, who went to the Public Security Bureau and the police station to request an interception, but there has been no news of it as of this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e198">True Picture of the Yi People in Sichuan Border Area <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Special Reporter of This Newspaper Photographed</p>
<p>The Sichuan border areas have long been inhabited by Yi tribes. Only a small part of them were assimilated after the conquest of the Greater and Lesser Jinchuan during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, while the rest remained wilderness. Last year, this newspaper specially sent Wang Xiaoting and Liu Shuofu to the Sichuan border area to collect the true picture of the lives of the Yi people in various places. From November of last winter to now, it has been more than six months. They have traveled long distances and ventured deep into the various Yi tribes in western Sichuan, northern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, Qiang Yi, Tibetan Yi, and the most ferocious Luo Yi, taking various films, such as Yi people's houses, Yi people's clothing, Yi people's lives, and the strange and dangerous mountains and gorges, hundreds of miles of high mountains and rivers. Because of the investigation of the Kang Tibetan war, they ventured to the front line of Daofu in western Sichuan to take films about the truth of the war and the situations that are not understood outside. There is also the second highest mountain in the world, the Mount Gongga with an altitude of more than 25,000 feet. Mr. Wang is the first Chinese person to photograph it. Recently, a letter from the two gentlemen stated that in recent years, the Luo Yi in southern Sichuan have often kidnapped people and seized land. The area near Mabian is occupied by the Luo Yi. Military affairs have been frequent. Dozens of miles were recovered starting this spring. Hearing that the Luo Yi are seeking peace, they went to Mabian again, all the way to the border of the recovered land, and after many dangers, they finally took many films that have never been seen outside. The Luo Yi live in caves and are extremely fierce and savage among the Yi tribes. In the past, many foreigners who entered the country were killed by them. In the travelogues of Westerners, they are regarded as an extremely barbaric nation. In addition to recording and photographing, the two gentlemen also carried a motion picture camera to take films. A telegram has been received recently stating that they will return to Shanghai next week. In the future, the publication will definitely make an extremely valuable contribution to the customs of the Sichuan border area.</p>

<p>Patrol Route Encounters Bandits</p>
<p>Li Guocai and Shen Lisheng Died</p>
<p>On the 1st of this month, near the Weiting Railway Station, bandits opened fire and wounded two road protection soldiers. On that day, the road protection soldiers Li Guocai and Shen Lisheng were patrolling along the railway and found two people, A and B, who looked like bandits. As they were about to step forward to search them, the bandits fired several shots first, wounding Li and Shen and causing them to fall to the ground before fleeing. The station sent the two wounded soldiers to Shanghai and transferred them to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. One soldier, Li Guocai, died on the afternoon of the 7th due to injuries to vital organs. The body was transported by car to the autopsy office. The Special District Court was reported and sent a prosecutor to verify the body and place it in a coffin. Another soldier, Shen Lisheng from Changzhou, was sent to the hospital. Although the doctor took out the bullet (with the letters C and the number 600 engraved on it), the injury was internal. The treatment was ineffective, and he died of his injuries yesterday. The hospital has notified the police station to send the body to the autopsy office for verification. At the same time, the garrison headquarters has issued an order for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Qian Baosheng Commits Suicide with Camphor Balls <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Frustrated and Unable to Achieve His Goals</p>
<p>Fortunately, He Was Rescued and Saved His Life</p>
<p>Qian Baosheng, a native of Luodian, was nineteen years old. He used to work in Ziyangguan in Shanghai, but recently he quit his job. The day before yesterday, he heard that his father was at a relative's house in Songjiang, so he went to Songjiang at 10:00 p.m. Upon learning that his father had already returned home, he checked into room No. 5 of the Xin Travel Agency on Nanchang Road, paid the room fee, and went out. Before long, he returned to the room and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, he had secretly taken several camphor balls, intending to commit suicide. At around 2:00 a.m., he groaned due to poisoning. The waiter, because the neighboring guest was not asleep, passed by room No. 5 and became suspicious. He immediately reported it to the innkeeper, who went into the room to inquire and saw that Qian's complexion was different and his words were vague. He was sent to the Seashore Public Hospital. After the doctor's diagnosis, he learned that he had swallowed camphor balls. Yesterday, he was cured by the hospital. The innkeeper sent someone to Luodian to inform his father and sent his brother to Songjiang to take him home. When asked about the reason for his suicide, it was said that although Baosheng was young, he had very high aspirations. He had recently lost his job, causing all his hopes to vanish, so he was angry and resorted to this extreme measure.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Poor Jiang Fukang <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Economic Hardship After Unemployment</p>
<p>Rescued After Throwing Himself into the Wusong River</p>
<p>Wrote a Very Painful Letter to His Parents</p>
<p>Said He Wanted to Become a Dog or Horse in the Next Life</p>
<p>At around 10:50 p.m. the night before last, a person suddenly jumped into the river from the Yunzaobang Bridge in Wusong, intending to commit suicide. He happened to be spotted by guard Liu Lunxuan, who immediately called nearby fishing boats to rescue him. Fortunately, he had not drunk too much water. After being resuscitated, he gradually woke up and was taken to the First Station of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, after questioning by Director Zhang, he stated that his name was Jiang Fukang, he was thirty-two years old, and he was from Sanbei, Ningbo. He had left his hometown for four or five years and had been making a living outside, only able to support himself. Recently, he had been suffering from illness and unemployment, and his economic situation was becoming increasingly dire. He was ragged and had no face to return to his hometown to see his parents, wife, and children. Yesterday, he took a bus to Songjiang and could not find his friend. For a time, he had no way to go, so he had the idea of ending his life. Now, he was fortunate to be rescued and requested to be settled, etc. A suicide note was found next to him, written to the Jiang Tongshun Pawnshop on Nannanmen Street, Guanhaiwei, Cibei, Ningbo. The letter was addressed to his parents. There were many typos in the letter, indicating that he only knew a little about writing and barely managed to write his general meaning, saying that he had been away from his parents for five years. He wanted to make something of himself outside but could not. You two are old. Buy some food if you want to eat. Make some clothes if you want to wear. I will not make something of myself in this life. I will definitely be reborn as a dog or a horse in the next life to repay you two. I am sick outside now, and my clothes and food are exhausted. I have no choice but to throw myself into the river to commit suicide. Parents, do not be sad, etc. Director Zhang immediately ordered the police to send a report to the General Bureau for disposition.</p>
<h3 id="e202">American Radio Industry Giant Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Nall, President of the American United Radio Corporation</p>
<p>Mr. Nall, President of the American United Radio Corporation, traveled the world with his wife this spring, departing from New York to inspect the branches of the company in various countries and to visit the scenery of various places. He arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, transferring from Beijing and Nanjing, and stayed at the Cathay Hotel in the Sassoon Building. He took the opportunity to visit the Zhenru International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications and the Lao Beimen Shanghai Radio Station, and was quite satisfied. He will now go to Xiaoluzong and other places for inspection and left Shanghai on the Canadian Empress the day before yesterday. He will return to Shanghai in early next month and then return to the United States. Mr. Nall is now seventy-two years old, but he is energetic and vigorous, like a young man. On the left is a photograph of Mr. and Mrs. Nall and Mrs. Zhu Qiqing when they boarded the ship at the New Customs Wharf. Mr. Nall's experience is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Nall was born in Fredericksburg, USA, in 1859. He was gifted and at the age of sixteen, he was only a messenger boy for the Western Union Telegraph Company. Due to his hard work, he was transferred to St. Louis and assigned as the director of the local Edison Telephone Branch. During his tenure, he proposed building a telegraph trunk line along the transcontinental railroad. After his detailed plan, it was finally completed step by step from 1880 to 1900. The number of telegraph offices across the country suddenly increased by thousands, and tens of thousands of people depended on it for a living. It was all the work of one person. At that time, the operator of this project was the Postal Telegraph-Cable Company, and he served as the manager and vice president of the company for a total of twenty-five years. Later, when radio was invented, he saw its importance and first initiated the organization of a commercial radio company in New York in 1913. It was finally established in 1914, named the American Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. He resigned from his position at the Postal Telegraph-Cable Company and was appointed as the manager and vice president of the new company. All operations were very ingenious. That year, he established direct radio communication between Japan and the United States, opening the era of international commercial radio telegraph. Radio became increasingly prominent. After that, through his plan, direct radio communications were established between the United States and the United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, and France, which was of great importance to the future of American telecommunications. The development of American commercial radio today is due to the contribution of Mr. Nall. In 1919, the American radio industry formed the American United Radio Corporation in New York, and he was elected as the president and CEO of the company. At the same time, he served as the president or CEO of the Radio Publishing House and other companies. In 1922, the Elsea International Radio Society was established. In 1923, the Commercial International Radio Association was established. He was elected as the general director of the association, etc. Due to his advanced age, he retired in 1928, but he is still a director of the American United Radio Corporation, etc.</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Council announced the Wusong New District, land prices along North Szechuan Road and Dixwell Road have risen sharply. In particular, the area around the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Szechuan Road is attracting the attention of real estate investors. Because the area is already the second commercial center of the entire city of Shanghai, two major companies are planning to build business centers there, facing each other to the east and west, creating a magnificent scene like a second Nanking Road. However, there are many contenders for the land, and the landowners are not willing to sell for the time being, so active competition is still underway.</p>

<p>Gui Lansun Sues Huang's Two Sons</p>
<p>Request for Recovery of House Construction Costs</p>
<p>Yesterday, Gui Lansun, acting as a contractor, retained lawyer Lu Shaozong as his representative and stated in a lawsuit to the French Court that the late Huang Chujiu had entered into a contract with the plaintiff to build a house at the corner of Rue Sainte-Marie and Route Tenant de la Tour, with a total construction cost of 29,000 taels, specifying that 5,000 taels would be paid each time, with the first payment due after the foundation was laid. Subsequently, the plaintiff proceeded according to the contract. Upon completion of the first stage of construction, the plaintiff requested payment of the construction cost, but it was delayed, and Huang subsequently passed away. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit requesting that Huang Zixianyao and Huang Xianzhong, Huang's two sons, be ordered to recover the full amount in accordance with the contract, as well as all losses and interest. The defendants, Huang Xianyao and Huang Xianzhong, represented by lawyer Tan Yigong, admitted the existence of this debt, but stated that all of Huang's assets had been transferred to accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng for liquidation, and requested the court to merge this case into Huang's liquidation proceedings.</p>

<p>A local named Chen Wenkui previously retained lawyer Ren Zhennan to sue He Zhimei for debt in the French Court. A judgment had already been rendered in favor of Chen. Because the defendant delayed in fulfilling the judgment, the court approved enforcement and implemented a provisional attachment of all movable property. Unexpectedly, after the enforcement, He Zhimei still dared to resist, and moved all the attached items away. He himself avoided meeting. He secretly entrusted Wang Shuxian and Zhang Dingxiang to carry eighty silver dollars on his behalf and approach the plaintiff's lawyer, Ren Zhennan, to request that the case be handled without strict urging. Lawyer Ren tentatively agreed. At that time, he also had Wang Shuxian write a receipt in his own handwriting, acknowledging that he had paid the money. Afterwards, lawyer Ren filed a report with the French Court. Yesterday, during the summons, Zhang Dingxiang did not arrive. Only Wang Shuxian was questioned and confirmed the facts. He was ordered to be detained and released on bail to show punishment. Zhang Dingxiang will be summoned later for further investigation. Regarding the defendant He Zhimei, Ren Zhennan's request to immediately issue an arrest warrant and bring him to justice for questioning should be approved.</p>

According to Zhang's confession, he works on the Beiyang steamer, and this drug was entrusted to him by a guest to buy and take back to Tianjin. Judge Feng immediately sentenced Zhang to one year of imprisonment, with an additional fine of two hundred yuan, and the heroin was confiscated.</p>

<p>It Seems Difficult to Renew Old Ties</p>
<p>Chen Xiufeng, the sister of a comprador Chen on the Japanese steamer Daifuku Maru, nearly thirty-nine years old, went to the Puwo Village in Zhujia Muqiao, Zhabei, and because she went to the tobacco and paper shop at the entrance of the alley every day, she became inexplicably involved with Feng Ming, a relative of the shop owner. Later, when her brother heard about it, he severely scolded her. Xiufeng took the opportunity to take her belongings and eloped with Feng, renting a house together as if they were husband and wife. This has been going on for ten years. At first, they were very harmonious. However, since last spring, they suddenly began to suspect each other. Chen accused Feng of having a new love, and Feng accused Chen of adultery with a man named Chen Arong. As a result, they went from quarreling to litigation. Feng sued Chen for restricting freedom, and after the court's investigation, Chen was declared not guilty. Chen sued Feng for seduction, abandonment, false accusation, and added a civil suit to recover 9,000 yuan in alimony and 3,000 yuan in damages for reputation loss. The case was heard in court yesterday afternoon by Judge Cheng of the Special District Local Court. Because the two parties were not formally married, but had been living together for ten years, the judge advised them to resolve the matter peacefully, considering their past relationship. Feng immediately expressed his willingness to give the plaintiff 300 yuan to end the relationship. However, Chen hoped for 1,000 yuan, and the amount was too different, so they could not reach a settlement. The lawyers for both parties then began their arguments and concluded. Judge Cheng then declared the defendant not guilty. The civil part of the case will be transferred to the civil court for hearing.</p>

<p>Man Resembling Worker Killed</p>
<p>The other day at noon, a man resembling a worker, about forty years old, was crossing the road at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Honan Road when a British military vehicle with number 9896, traveling east on Avenue Edward VII, sped by and knocked the man down and injured him. A Chinese police officer with number 1900 saw this, recorded the vehicle number, and sent the injured man to the hospital. However, his injuries were too severe and he died before he could be treated. His body was taken to the morgue on Phalen Road. Yesterday morning, a report was made to the Special District Local Court, which commissioned Inspector Guo to visit the morgue to examine the body and inquire about the circumstances of the incident. As it had been ascertained that there were no family members, it was ordered that the Pushan Villa take custody of the body for coffin preparation and burial.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Iron Factory Foreman Steals Car Model, Exposure <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The China Iron Factory, located west of the Wusong Yunzaobang, has recently seen thriving business due to the high price of silver and demand from silk weaving factories in various ports for custom-made silk twisting machines, thread winding machines, and towel machines. Silk weaving factories are happy to purchase these machines because they are comparable to imported goods but are much cheaper. It is said that the factory foreman, Jiang Ruisheng, who has been employed at the factory for four or five years, saw that these machines had a wide market and high profits, and intended to manufacture them outside the factory to get rich. Therefore, while working at the factory, he stole three iron models and two wooden models of the machine, wrapped them in his clothes, and had a worker named Su Tiansheng take them to Shanghai the other evening. When they arrived at Yunzaobang Bridge, they were discovered by a police officer on duty and taken back to the No. 1 Section of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau. Under questioning, Su confessed that the foreman Jiang Ruisheng had asked him to send them to Shanghai. The section then notified the China Iron Factory to detain the foreman and send him to the section for detention. Currently, because General Manager Lu Chengshu is not in Shanghai, they must wait for Manager Lu to return to Shanghai to investigate who instigated the theft of the registered trademark, intending to counterfeit and disrupt business. The factory will file a lawsuit in court to warn against imitation.</p>

<p>Zhang Xisheng Dies of Suffocation</p>
<p>Zhang Xisheng, over sixty years old, who managed the Gan ancestral hall on Nanshinhsi Road, Jiangwan, had rented a spare room to a Liang, a staff member of Labor University. The other night, they had a petty quarrel and wrestled with each other. Zhang, who was old and agitated, suddenly suffocated and died. The family members believed that Zhang had been killed by Liang, so they filed a complaint with the police station, and Liang was arrested. Yesterday, the local headman reported the death to the local court for examination. Inspector Wu was commissioned to the scene, and after examining the body, he determined that the deceased had indeed died of suffocation after being beaten. The family members were instructed to take custody of the body for burial, pending Liang's arrest for investigation.</p>

<p>Xinghua People Kidnap Pootung People</p>
<p>Zhang Jiangzhen is Five Years Old</p>
<p>Chen Wu, a Fujianese woman, nineteen years old, residing at No. 4 Sheng'an Lane, Meizhu Street, South City, was visited the other day by an acquaintance from Xinghua County named Wu Yuzhen, who was holding a lively and lovely girl, about four or five years old, wearing luxurious clothes and leather shoes. Wu said that the child needed to be temporarily left in her care, and that after a few days, she would be taken back to her hometown. Because they were both acquainted, Wu did not ask about the child's background and agreed to take her in. Unexpectedly, after Wu Yuzhen left, the child cried all day long and refused to eat. Fearing that there was something hidden and that complications might arise later, Wu notified the watchman He Yushi of the 11th post that evening around midnight and took the child to the 3rd Section of the 1st District. Chief Jin questioned her about the situation. He immediately dispatched police to bring Wu Yuzhen in for preliminary interrogation. Wu confessed that she was forty years old, residing at Zhengjia Muqiao in the Public Concession, and worked as a cook. Last month, an acquaintance named Wang Ar Er came and said that he had a granddaughter (referring to the girl) named Xiuying, who was five years old. Because her parents were both dead, and his family was poor and struggling, he was unable to raise her and was planning to sell her. At that time, because Wu lacked children, she agreed. Wang Li, Chen Zhou, and Cai Chang, an old woman who ran a matchmaking shop at No. 84 Langjia Bridge outside Datongmen, acted as intermediaries. She paid 60 yuan to buy the girl and temporarily left her at Chen Wu's house. The girl said that her name was Zhang Jiangzhen, five years old, from Pootung, and that she had a mommy and daddy at home. It was observed that the child did not look like she came from a poor family, and her statements were completely different from Wu's confession, clearly indicating that there was something false and incomplete in the situation. Because the matter concerned the sale of people, it was ordered that they be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Thugs Zhang Baolin, Zhang Gencai, and Dao Ba Ah Jin surrounded and extorted the street vendor Zhang Alin at the Yangshupu Dongting Road Pier. Because Alin resisted, they recklessly assaulted him and then robbed him of 27 yuan in cash. Alin immediately reported to the police station. It was not until the other day that Detective Liu Changgen arrested Zhang Baolin on Zhaofeng Road. Yesterday, he was brought to the Special District Local Court and questioned by Judge Feng. The defendant's confession was evasive. Because the police station requested an extension to track down the remaining accomplices and investigate other cases, Judge Feng ordered the defendant to be detained and the matter postponed for further investigation.</p>

<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast for 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Yangtze River basin and northern China are clear. This is due to the north of the Bo Hai and Huang Hai. The cyclone south of Japan is progressing slowly further north due to another low pressure. A secondary low pressure center has formed in the Sea of Japan and is moving northeast, so the weather is also deteriorating. A hurricane is forming southwest of Taiwan and may be moving north. Also, the highest temperature in Shanghai in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday was 89.1 degrees and the lowest was 58.3 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 83.1 degrees and the lowest was 68.7 degrees.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I have read in your newspaper on June 6 that the Municipal Health Bureau, in order to prevent harm from mad dogs, has formulated regulations for the elimination of stray dogs. Dog owners are asked to apply for licenses, with a license fee of 50 cents per head in the urban area and 25 cents in the rural area. This does not conform to the original text. After checking our Bureau's announcement, it is written that the license fee is one yuan per head in the urban area, and half price, five jiao per head, in the rural area. Please correct this immediately to avoid miscommunication. I hope you will take note. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, June 12.</p>

<p>— Ke Dingjin</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, my old friend Wang Yiming came to see me, accompanied by three people who said they were from the Xiang River. They were uneasy about the banditry in their hometown and came to Shanghai to seek a peaceful life. They brought with them a true copy of the Lanting Xu preface from the Dingwu period. I once saw Sang Shichang's Lanting Examination, which stated, "Emperor Taizong of Tang obtained the true copy of Lanting and had it engraved at the Academy of Scholars. Zhu Liang usurped it and transported it to Bian capital. Yelü Deguang broke the Later Jin and carried this engraving across the river. After Emperor Taizong returned, he discarded it in the Slaughter Tiger Forest along with his luggage. Later, it was placed in Dingzhou. Hence, it was named Ding Ben, and the world called it the Dingwu Lanting, because Dingzhou was originally the Yiwu Army during the Tang Dynasty. During the Song Dynasty, to avoid the taboo of Emperor Taizong's name, it was renamed Dingwu. During the Ninghe period, the emperor ordered the former staff of the Dingwu school to inquire about the Lanting stone. They obtained it from Xue Sichang, a commander in Chang'an. At that time, Liang Shicheng, an eunuch and receiver in Chang'an, issued a decree to take the old engraving. Xue Sichang hastily made a rubbing of the stone with three sheets of paper. The first rubbing was dark, the second was light, and the third was even lighter. The world called it the cicada wing copy." Furthermore, Gengzi Xiaoxia Ji also says, "Sun Chengzhe also said that there are two types of Dingwu copies circulating in the world: fat and thin." What I saw this year was a scroll several zhang long, with clear handwriting. I have no doubt that it was the true copy of Dingwu. The sages who participated in the spring purification ceremony were also depicted on the scroll, with vivid expressions and exquisite workmanship. Each had a small biography attached, which was extremely elegant. It was truly a rare treasure in the world. Huang Tingjian's horizontal scroll, full of vigor and vitality, was complete in spirit. My friend Meng Weng Shouzhi likes to write in the style of Shangu, and recently, his "Lotus Sutra" calligraphy has been circulating. His brushwork is powerful and can be compared to Shangu. Youren wrote in the postscript, "Shangu would also nod in approval if he were alive again." This is no exaggeration. Meng Weng should be very happy to see this scroll. Four framed calligraphy scrolls written by He Shaoji and Zeng Guofan during the Qing Dynasty, a vertical axis of Wang Weiren, the top scholar during the Qianlong period, titled "Autumn Water Floats Golden Goose," were all excellent. A bronze plate unearthed at the same time as the Shang tripod was shaped like an old-fashioned copper basin. Although there were broken holes, when struck, it made a golden sound, which was strange. (It is said that a foreign company has purchased the Shang tripod for over 20,000 yuan.) There were knife marks on it that shone like gold, which was dazzling. I don't know what dynasty it was from. It is a pity that the bronze mirror from the Tang Dynasty was broken into two pieces. It is said that when a person looks at it at a high place, he can see the scenery dozens of miles away without any errors. The mirror surface is mottled with green flowers, and the color is elegant and simple. It is an ancient telescope. A piece of carnelian jade in the shape of a turtle shell and small. When viewed against the light, there are clear pine needles. It is like an elaborate painting. All of these are truly rare treasures in the world. I am rushing to write a letter to Huang Binhong and Zhang Shanzi to evaluate them. I unintentionally had the opportunity to visit them. My eyes were blessed immeasurably. The owner is Mr. Li from Xiangjiang, whose ancestors were colleagues and friends with Zeng Guofan.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Record of a Visit to Qishan <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Cailiang</p>
<p>Qishan is a famous scenic spot in Jin County. It is said that Emperor Qinshihuang of Qin once stayed here during his southern tour. It is about two li away from my town (Zhangxi), which is also the location of Mr. Gao Chuiwan's Keli. Every year, on the 1st and 28th of March of the lunar calendar and the 1st of April, there is a farmers' market. Those who come as scheduled, no matter how far, are crowded with each other, and trade is quite prosperous. Only after noon does it become quiet. It still follows the ancient system of having markets during the day. The other day, I happened to return home for business, and it happened to be the last time for this year's market. I knew that the opportunity could not be missed, so I went on foot after getting up in the morning. Walking and walking again, I arrived in less than half an hour. Along the way, bamboo fences and thatched houses made for a pleasant scenery, which was enough to refresh the spirits of those who have been trapped in the city for a long time. When I arrived at the foot of the mountain, I saw a sea of people, shoulder to shoulder. There was a sense of being on the book-covered road. In total, there were about 200 stalls on both sides. There was almost no space on the whole mountain. Looking at what was on display, most of it was agricultural tools. Unfortunately, they still clung to the old methods. It is lamentable that the progress of China's agricultural industry has not improved. Then I went up the steps, walking three times before reaching the top of the mountain. There was an ancient temple at the top. The temple had only three rooms, but the environment was quite clear and open. I went inside to rest for a while. As soon as I sat down, I suddenly saw what was called crooked poems on the wall, which were almost completely covered. Elegant and vulgar were mixed together, which was quite amusing to read. I don't know who started this bad habit of tarnishing famous scenic spots. As the saying goes, famous soil is not worth half a cent. It is true. Then I said goodbye and left. Suddenly, it started raining. I went straight to the pavilion at the foot of the mountain to take shelter. At that time, more and more people gathered with me. Soon, it was full. The pavilion was newly built. There was a couplet, "It is most regrettable that we are like drifting duckweeds passing by, unable to break off willows to give to travelers." The language is profound, which is enough to make us travelers feel alarmed. After a while, the rain stopped, and the farmers' market also came to an end. I then said that I would return and write this record.</p>

<p>— Liu Mengdie</p>
<p>In Dongting Town, Xizhi, there is a Mr. Hua, a descendant of Grand Master Hongshan from the Three Smiles Play. His daughter married to Changan Town, thirty li away. She already had a son. One afternoon, the daughter saw a certain Jia from Dongting Town arrive breathlessly, saying, "Your father suddenly became critically ill last night in the middle of the night. He was treated too late, and he died at dawn. I have come to report the funeral." The daughter was shocked to hear this and almost fainted. Jia then continued, "Your mother said that the fortune teller has determined that the coffin will be placed at midnight tonight. She ordered you to return in a sedan chair. All the clothes and belongings that are inconvenient to carry in the chair can be packed up and given to me to take back first. The road is long at dusk, so hurry up!" The daughter thought that what he said made sense. She hurriedly arranged things in her boudoir. Thinking that she would have to stay for many days, she prepared enough clothes, shoes, and jewelry, forming a large package. After that, she thought that Jia had been in and out of her mother's house and seemed familiar, so she did not suspect him. She gave the package to him, and he left. Then, the daughter asked someone to prepare a sedan chair and hugged her son into it. She wept all the way. When she arrived home, it was already dark. She got out of the chair and entered the door, immediately crying loudly and calling for her father. Her father heard the sound in the inner room and came out in surprise to ask what was wrong. Her family also gathered in surprise. The daughter was even more surprised to see her father. Then she learned that her father was unharmed. She wiped away her tears and smiled, turning grief into joy, as if she did not care about the loss of her clothes and belongings. However, her father was very angry. He ordered people to search the market for Jia, but he had disappeared without a trace. It turned out that Jia was a strong member of the Red Pill Party. He had been without food for three days. He had a unique idea to relieve his worries. However, it was a very bad joke.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Success After Resentment <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Rooster Crest</p>
<p>The other day, at a friend's banquet, I heard Mr. Zhou say that near the Confucius Temple, there were two restaurants, closely aligned and competing fiercely in business. According to those in the know, this contains a history of resentment, which is quite amusing to recount.</p>
<p>Initially, a resident of Ningbo named Jin often ate out for breakfast. One day, he went to a restaurant near the Confucius Temple for tea and snacks. The business was booming, and the waiters were very busy. After waiting for over an hour, the snacks he ordered still hadn't arrived. Jin became impatient and angrily questioned the waiter, who didn't back down and glared back, mocking him: "If you're not satisfied with the slow service and delayed food here, you might as well open your own restaurant, then you can order things as you please!" Feeling ridiculed by the cold words, Jin angrily left. Unexpectedly, several months later, a new restaurant opened nearby, selling the same Yangzhou-style snacks. The owner was none other than Jin, who had left in anger. After a year of business, his livelihood was quite good, surpassing the original restaurant. This was truly a gift from the waiter's provocation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I once heard someone from my hometown say that on both sides of the Guan Yi River in Wuxing City, there were many ferry boats, providing access to Jin Po Lane and the front of Youwen Hall. There was a wealthy man named Wen in the city. One rainy day, he took a ferry, and, feeling it was too slow, he argued with the boatman. The boatman was also impolite and mocked him, saying, "If you want to go faster, you might as well build a bridge over the river!" He probably didn't know it was Mr. Wen and deliberately made things difficult for him. Later, the local area suddenly heard about a plan to build a bridge. The one in charge of the project was none other than Mr. Wen, who had been insulted by the boatman. The bridge was completed the year before last and named Qiao Liang. The ferry business was severely impacted, but pedestrians found it very convenient. Money is all-powerful. This is similar to the previous story, achieving the same result through different means. There's no other way to describe it but as success after resentment.</p>

<p>— Talia</p>
<p>Since the custom of women binding their breasts became popular, people have followed suit, with no sign of decline. Although the Ministry of Interior has repeatedly issued orders to ban it, the speakers are earnest, but the listeners are indifferent. This is especially true among female students in schools. It is now heard that the Xiaoshan County Girls' Middle School in Zhejiang Province believes that breast binding is harmful to the health of female students and has ordered all female students to liberate their breasts and plans to conduct regular inspections to prevent concealment. As a result, the female students of the school have been looking ashamed these days.</p>
<p>The harm of breast binding to women is not only related to the health of the individual and postpartum fertility, but also has a profound impact, leading the nation to a state of weakness. Now, the school has pioneered liberation. The news has spread far and wide. It is not only pleasing to the women themselves but also a cause for celebration for the future of the nation.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>(2) Sacrificed for Cornbread</p>
<p>By four o'clock in the afternoon, it was time for Zhang Xiaosan to return his rickshaw. He took the rickshaw back to the rickshaw depot, paid fifty cents for the rickshaw fee, and had one hundred and fifty cents left, both copper coins and copper tickets, all stuffed in his pocket. He bought a pack of cigarettes with five cents, put one in his mouth, and walked back slowly along the shade of the wall. His home was a large courtyard shared by ten families in a dozen or so rooms. The "large" in "large courtyard" did not praise the size of the house, but rather the chaotic nature of the courtyard. Besides the three rickshaw pullers, the families were mostly small craftsmen like shoemakers, cart drivers, and sugar figure makers. As soon as Zhang Xiaosan entered the courtyard, he saw his wife, Zhang Ersao, with a soapy washbasin on a square stool under the eaves, apparently intending to wash her face. He walked forward and kicked the stool over with his foot. The washbasin made a "clang" and water spilled all over the ground. Zhang Ersao, who was just about to go inside to get a white cloth towel, turned around and stamped her foot, saying, "Have you gone mad? What did the washbasin do to you?" Zhang Xiaosan tilted the cigarette in his mouth and scolded, "A rickshaw puller's wife, using foreign soap to wash her face? What are you trying to beautify yourself for? I, Zhang Xiaosan, don't sell wives for profit, so there's no need for you to be so extravagant. Or do you have your eye on some young, good-looking guy in this alley and want to seduce him?" Zhang Ersao had a yellowish persimmon face with a ponytail that reached her neck, but there were large strands of yellow hair on both sides that reached her ears. She wore a blue cloth jacket that resembled a Taoist robe, loose and not fitting her body. She tossed her head, and the stray hairs and ponytail swayed with her. Raising her arm, which exposed half of her yellowish-wax-colored arm, she pointed and said, "Zhang Xiaosan, are you talking like a human being? The poor should still have some dignity! It's not excessive to buy a piece of coarse soap for eight cents to wash my face. If you can't bear to spend a few cents, fine. I'll just grab a handful from the feces and urine and cook that for you to eat! Let me tell you, don't go crazy like this again. This old woman is like settling accounts while riding a donkey—just you wait and see!" Zhang Xiaosan threw the cigarette in his mouth on the ground, laughed, and said, "She's putting on airs! Zhang Xiaosan doesn't lack a clever wife like you. When I strike it rich, we'll..." "Bang!" The door slammed shut. Zhang Ersao said from inside the room, "Don't come in. Go get rich!" Zhang Xiaosan said, "Don't make trouble. I need to go in and get some clean clothes. I want to go to the bathhouse to take a bath." Zhang Ersao said, "Who's making trouble with you? Why don't you look at your face in the chamber pot? Do you even deserve it?"</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Sixty Rhymes on a Journey to the Yellow Sea</p>
<p>In Liaoyang, the ice melts firmly in the third month. I followed the spring scenery out of the willow banks. Traveling by land is not as convenient as floating on the sea. I took a detour through Qingdao to Dalian. The flock of seagulls bid farewell to me with sincere thoughts. Recalling the seagulls, I wanted to tap on the side of the boat. The old fortress has been covered in insects and sand for fifteen years. Stroking it, the atmosphere is still enduring for thousands of years. The astronomical observatory has become a place to survey the vast cosmos. The wonders of heaven and earth are right before my eyes. A great thief enters the house, and the owner loses power. They seize treasures and flaunt them in the marketplace. What was unseen in the past is now seen. I tried the hot springs under the Qian Mountains. Temporarily cleansing my heart, I felt as light as a fairy. I went straight to Shenyang, shaking the reins of my horse while composing poetry. Good sons and good wives welcomed me with joy. The Grand Academy is green and pure. Morning meals and evening delicacies were accompanied by the sound of spring strings. Paintings entered the city in a winding procession. Zhongxuan's secretary was so elegant. The literary talents of Jiangshan were rich and vast. I widely collected literature to compile a great work, taking on the burden of the White Mountains and Black Waters. Among them, I especially admired the virtuous magistrate. Light carriage, simple entourage, walking through the streets. Da Han Ying Tun is an ancient legend. Xi Zhai visited his father and wept here. The people and the place are blessed by heaven. An official who loves the people and not money. Teaching the masses with simple words and clear principles. On the way back, I visited the ancient people's temple. The stone horses of Zhao Mausoleum are covered with green grass. I can't put down the blue and green thoughts. My ten days in Shenyang have not been wasted. The diligent students were eager to learn day and night. I am ashamed of lacking a broad and eloquent tongue. The ancient Korean name of the Mazhi River has been passed down. The names of Han Mountain and Han River still exist. Ink filled the tent above the Mingyue Tower. Entering the Qiting, the singing startled all around. The dragon head pines above the court were locked in smoke. I departed from Bakan at dusk and couldn't sleep. Cherry blossoms filled the fields like snow. Snowy skin and floral faces competed for spring beauty. The thunderous train flew across the Edo River. The spring city flower festival was filled with colorful carriages. Tokyo and Xijing followed one after another. The falling petals quickly turned into the sound of cuckoos. I floated on a painted boat on Lake Ashi and the West Sea. The cauldron at the Owakudani valley boiled fiercely. The four mountains were white, and the clouds spread out. I never had a half-face encounter with Mount Fuji. The mountain spirit and I stared at each other. My wife in her dark blue dress wore out her feet in vain. The blue sea chickens and pigs were deliciously fat. I returned to the ancient Kinkaku-ji Temple along winding paths. I packed up my travels and returned to my inkstone field. I completed this Yellow Sea Round-Trip Poem. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e232">Fluctuating Weakness in Gold Standard <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>The rise and fall were only three or four taels. Yesterday, the 12th, the gold standard continued to decline slightly, with some fluctuations, hovering around 800 taels all day. However, the fluctuations were not large, and the difference between the highest and lowest price was only three or four taels. The total market had a difference of 9 taels. Looking back, it has already fallen by 5 taels. The silver market reported an increase in the initial opening, then a slight decrease. Afterwards, due to rumors that the US silver market exchange would open on June 15th, there was fear that Shanghai speculators would go to buy silver bars, causing the price to rise. Therefore, the sentiment was downward, causing the gold price to suddenly break through 800 taels. The foreign exchange market was weak in both the official and unofficial markets, and had already fallen by half a point. The buying and selling prices on the counter were different. At noon, the exchange rate seemed to ease up and once again rose above 800 taels. The market was still stable with slight advances and retreats. The final calculation was 802-3 taels, and the consensus among the firms was hesitant and unpredictable.</p>
<p>In the morning, the initial collection showed signs of decline. In the early morning, the July opening price dropped slightly by one tael to 806 taels and 2 mace. The large bars returned a profit of 1/16, the silver price was 1/8, and the private telegrams only rose 1/16. It was truly that the US had no intention to sell. Soon after, Yuanchun, Yuanmao, Yongbingxing, etc. all sold, so it fell another four taels. At 9:15, it was 02 taels and 2 mace. As for the English gold, it was sold by the Hua Bank to English and Japanese banks for August at 25. Then, Dalian groups and commodity hedgers bought in, and Huayi also took next month's English gold 25, so it rose another one tael. The initial announcement was 03 taels and 4 mace, but the listed prices were 125 for American gold and 25 for Japanese gold, with Japanese gold falling by one and a half cents. Yuanxing, Yongdaxing, Yongyuda, Qianchang, Xiangyuan, and Cheng et al. sold, and the price immediately depreciated by more than three taels. By 10 o'clock, it was 799 taels and 4 mace. In between, there was a difference of more than one tael. Suddenly, Hengxing, Qianchangxiang, etc. came in, and it was already added to 801 taels and 8 mace. After that, Taiwan offered Dalian at 1 tael, 7 mace, 875, and the English Gold Bank bought 3125. Then it became difficult to sell, coupled with Zhifeng, Yonghengyu, Yuanchun, Yiyu, and Xinheng all leaning to sell, the wind quickly turned downward, falling by four taels in a few cents, and suddenly at 10:30, it was 797 taels and 1 mace. Soon after, speculator Wu and Qianchangxiang, Yuanhengbingxing, Wanxingshunli, etc. all entered, and the bank ate English gold 25. At 11 o'clock, it was 803 taels. In an instant, it retreated to 800 taels and 05 cents, and then Yuanfeng, Yonghengyu, etc. bought in, and each firm had settled English gold from 1875 to 25. The market saw good news, and at 11:45, it was 803 taels and 8 mace. Wanxing, Tongtaichang, etc. sold off, and at noon, it was 02 taels and 7 mace, then it was suppressed to one tael and 34 cents. The listed price was changed to 838 taels and 2 mace, suppressed from 35-6 taels to outside 40 taels, the noon collection was 35-6 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market saw slight fluctuations. The afternoon market opened at 02 taels and 2 mace, followed by 3 taels. The Indian exchange rate was low in the near term and rose in the far term, so it was 01 taels and 7 mace. Daxingyong, etc. came in, and suddenly it was added to 03 taels and 2 mace. Afterwards, commodities and Yongfeng, Fuchang, etc. sold off, because English gold could be settled at 25, and the sentiment was frustrated, so it dropped by more than 4 taels. After 3 o'clock, it was 799 taels. Only occasionally were there one or two taels of ups and downs. Later, Zhengjin ate English gold 25 to 2125, and Yuanmao, Yongyuancheng, Yongfuyu, Yuanxingyong, etc. were all vying to buy, so the price gradually rose by 4 taels, but there was a fluctuation of more than one tael, and at 4 o'clock it was 03 taels and 2 mace. At this time, the Indian exchange rate also reported a small anna. Afterwards, there were slight ups and downs of a few cents, seeming to indicate a weak trend. At 4:30, the closing price was 02 taels and 4 mace, a decrease of 4 taels and 8 mace compared to the previous day. It was then traded to 2 taels and zero. According to the highest price in the front and afternoon markets, 806 taels and 3 mace, the lowest price was 797 taels and 1 mace, a difference of 9 taels and 2 mace. The commodity market was 6 taels and 2 mace in the early market, 2 taels and 8 mace at noon, 2 taels and a half in the afternoon, and 2 taels and 2 mace at the closing. The listed price was 35-6 taels suppressed, registered at 803 taels, water replenishment 01 taels, and 800 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The trading volume of each firm varied. Qianchangxiang, Cuichangyong, Hengxing, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanheng, Hongli, Fuyu, Yuanmao, Bingxing all entered. Wanxing and Shunli sought more than they supplied. Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Futai, Yuanxingyong, Futaiheng, Yiyu, and Yuancheng alternately bought and sold.

Yongfeng, Fuchangzhifengyong, and commodities, Wanxing, and Tongtaichang all sold. Yuantai, Dadecheng, Hengyu, and Yifengyong had inconsistent receipts and disbursements. The Dalian gang jointly verified the purchase of more than a thousand bars, and the Guangdong gang only entered 4-500 bars. Speculator Wu entered slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Foreign Exchange Market Remains Stable <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>

All others have also been extended. The internal market was initially stable and then loose, returning to stable at noon, and recovering from weakness in the afternoon. Only the gold market continued to fall, while the exchange market was still able to stand firm. As a result, they were not much different from the previous evening. It is heard that the New York Silver Exchange will soon be established, and silver bars may rise. Yesterday, Chinese merchants' transactions were still active. English gold was traded for about 200,000 pounds. In the gold industry, sales were mostly higher than settlements, with a total of more than 100,000 pounds thrown out. Japanese banks such as Zhengjin and Mitsui continued to buy. A small amount of American gold was thrown out, and Japanese gold was settled by Dalian groups for Dalian bills of about 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>The internal market for English exchange fluctuated by 125. The most tight price offered by the bank was 1 shilling 2 pence 1875, and the loosest was 3125.

<p>Yesterday, according to the London telegram, large bar silver saw gains again, with near and far futures both increasing by 0625, both calculated at 12 pence and 25.

<h3 id="e235">Extremely Quiet Early Summer Short-Term Financing Market <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>It is a common custom in the financial world that transactions are usually very leisurely during the mid-summer months, and this year, due to the economic downturn, it is even worse than before. Therefore, the market has cooled down in advance before mid-summer. The current form of stagnation is definitely the most severe of the entire year, causing the good market to lack any important news to record, which is quite regrettable.</p>
<p>Short-Term Financing Prices: (Foreign Cent) According to yesterday's weak foreign market, the short-term financing price did not have a very good outlook. The early market was 7 mace 2 cents 7 li 7 hao and a half, and the noon market was 7 mace 2 cents 7 li 8 hao and 7 xuhalf, resulting in a decrease of 375 compared to the previous day's noon market. (Silver Discount) The early and noon markets were 3 cents, also a small decrease of 1 cent compared to the previous day. However, the intraday market once traded at 4 cents. The clearing was consistently sluggish, once trading at 3-4 cents, then from 2-3 cents to a blank clearing.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The early market for Jiangnan small foreign coins was 6 mace 4 cents 9 li and a half, and the noon market was 6 mace 4 cents 9 li, with a transaction volume of 3,000 corners in the early market and 2,000 corners in the noon market. The early market for Guangdong small foreign coins was 120,000 corners, and the noon market was 90,000 corners. The market price was 6 mace 4 cents 6 li in the early market and 6 mace 4 cents 6 and a half in the noon market. Copper coins decreased by another 2,500 coins, to 376,000 coins, with a transaction volume of more than 31,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Yuan Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds): News of bank collection and disbursement was also very dull. Chinese merchants collected and disbursed over 2.7 million taels, foreign merchants collected and disbursed only over 1.6 million taels, and various exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds collected and disbursed over 8 million taels, with 900,000 taels leaving the warehouse. Japanese banks collected and disbursed over 4.4 million taels of various funds, with 500,000 taels leaving the warehouse. Qianzhuang and silver companies collected and disbursed over 41.1 million taels, clearing funds collected and disbursed over 3.5 million taels, various exchange funds collected and disbursed over 700,000 taels, and over 1 million taels were collected in cash. (Foreign Funds) Exchange and transfer funds opened at 1.225 million in the early market and 30,000 banknotes. In the noon market, exchange and transfer funds opened at 950,000, and 70,000 banknotes. The over-the-counter market for banknotes was 144,000 in the early market and 85,000 in the noon market. Bank transactions were 650,000 in interbank trading in the early market and 600,000 in interbank trading in the noon market. Various banks received and disbursed over 1.4 million taels of foreign accounts, and over 1.8 million taels of banknotes flowed in and out. Qianzhuang and foreign companies collected and disbursed over 4.8 million taels, and clearing funds collected and disbursed over 1.4 million taels. Over 1.2 million foreign funds were borrowed in, and small qianzhuang transactions totaled over 500,000 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Securities: Bond Market Gradually Quiets Down <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the transaction situation of public bonds was still sparse in the spot market, and the futures market also turned weak. The atmosphere was leisurely in both the front and afternoon markets. The bond market's environment was dull, and people were watching and waiting. Furthermore, the restrictions on submitting physical goods for long-term futures trading made swap transactions difficult, so the market became increasingly leisurely. Supply and demand were balanced, bond prices were stagnant, and the front and afternoon markets revolved with little change. The settling situation was only seen in the past month. As a result, price increases and decreases were intertwined, with differences of only a few corners. The total spot market transactions for the day were 10,000 yuan, and the front and afternoon markets for futures were over 11.6 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Mediocre <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, but the situation feels even more desolate, without any revitalizing signs. However, external cotton prices rose again, but local sentiment became weak. This situation is very rare. The market has been very chaotic recently. Present yarn business is less than yesterday, but Sichuan merchants had good purchasing appetite. Most 16-count and 20-count yarns in the market are out of stock, and market prices are firm. However, coarse yarn sales are relatively sluggish. There are many large-scale traders selling out and closing positions on the benchmark, and rumors of political turmoil are rampant, so the market is becoming softer.</p>
<p>Yarn Benchmark Desolate: The Yarn Benchmark Market opened with a fall because although US cotton prices rose, one large trader sold out. It first rose by 4-5 cents, then turned and fell. As a result, it fell by 1, 2 or 3 cents. The afternoon was flat, near a small cent. The far month rose by 1 or 2 cents. The total turnover for the day was 13,250 bales. It was found that Hengde sold 2,100 bales, Yichang 1,200 bales, and Tongyu 700 bales. Yuande bought 550 bales, Changfeng 1,050 bales, Jifeng 800 bales, and Heshen 800 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Mediocre: Current yarn sales are mediocre. According to the full-day purchases of each trade group,</p>
<p>The purchasing trend is firm. Among the customer groups, Sichuan entered 650 bales, Yunnan 500 bales, Guangdong entered 250 bales, mainland China entered 330 bales, Gaoyang entered 50 bales, Andong entered 40 bales, Jiangxi entered 40 bales, and miscellaneous groups entered 200 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market is softening, but U.S. cotton continues to rise, and the exchange rate is slightly weak, resulting in a flat mood and a lack of energy. The current cotton trading is sluggish, the yarn market is weak, and the cotton market is displaying weakness. There is no eager to sell, and the future situation is uncertain.</p>
<p>The recent months of the Han standard has slightly decreased. The Han standard market opened, and followed the foreign cotton to stabilize slightly, before falling five points to a dime. The afternoon was flat, with no ups and downs. Total trade volume for the day was 31,600 piculs. It was found that Rongxing sold 3,400 piculs, Shenchang 2,700 piculs, and Shenyu 1,200 piculs. Tianlong purchased 4,600 piculs, Changfeng 1,900 piculs, and Xinheng 1,400 piculs. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>American cotton counterparts bought in. Yesterday's American cotton market was firm. It initially weakened due to good weather but strengthened later due to buying by counterparts and short covering. Futures rose 20 to 23 points, spot prices rose 20 points. English cotton futures rose 23 points, spot prices rose 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 15 points. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to short covering and buying by brokers, then declined due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Pingle Olmra and Bairoxi each rose 2 rupees.

<h3 id="e240">Grains: Downstream Trend Continues in the Hexia Rice Market <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday in the Northern Shanghai rice market, 3-4 barge numbers of rice boats were seen arriving from various routes. Sales continued to be extremely slow. Sales of Changshu and Xixi white japonica varied, with initial transactions being acceptable but prices weakening slightly. Medium-grade and lower rice prices weakened by 2 jiao. Early and late rice lacked customers, with more arriving, prices shrank by 3-4 jiao, changing to 2 yuan in the shade. Wine sales also turned sluggish. Bo rice with short quantity and a small amount of foreign currency sold slowly and demand in the markets are slowing, prices slightly softening. The trend for Lu Bu rice also remained lacking in spirit, with sales and arrivals each down by 2, shrinking by 1 chi. Sales of Southern Port white rice were better, the market surface was firm, and prices of guest rice had no major gains or losses. About 2600-2700 dan of various goods were opened from boats.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday's rice situation saw over 20 boats arriving. Northern japonica sales were extremely dull, and prices fell by 2 jiao. Su Tongbei's white japonica also trended downstream, with the situation being poor. Sales in both urban and rural areas of the entire city were slow. Prices recovered by 1.5 chi. Bo rice and early rice from Nanbang, Shipu, Sijing, Songjiang, and other places saw the decline turn heavy, with a drop of 2-3 jiao. This was due to the lack of buying interest and arrivals, as well as soft prices in the production areas. Although the arrival of foreign rice was slightly scarcer, the accumulated rice remained unsold, and the appetite remained closed. This street remained insignificant, leading to a further decrease of 0.5 chi in prices. Glutinous rice and white rice sales also turned sluggish, with the situation trending downstream.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Wheat Flour: Prices Gradually Decrease <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months trended downward. The quotation for foreign wheat also decreased by 1-2 jiao. The weather was also calm and sunny, exceptionally good. Both domestic and international environments favored short positions. The mentality of inland merchants also seemed to be inevitably influenced. They had no choice but to gradually sell off their long positions. Although the factories still maintained their positions, and merchants from Southeast Asia slightly increased their purchases, the overall trend was still downward. Recently, over 70% of the new wheat in the Jiangnan and Jiangbei regions has been harvested. Samples sent to Shanghai were all exceptionally dry. The quality in Jiangbei was also better than in previous years. The sluggishness of the market was beyond human control. As a result, the price for this month fell by 2.75 fen compared to the previous day, July fell by 2.5 fen, August fell by 1.5 fen, September fell by 1.75 fen, October fell by 1.25 fen, and November fell by 1.75 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Wheat Futures All Extremely Weak <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months trended sluggish and listless. The quotation for foreign wheat also decreased by 1-2 jiao, seemingly declining throughout the week. In addition, the weather was beautiful and sunny, as usual. With such favorable natural conditions, there was no way to prevent the price from falling. Therefore, although the long positions of the traders still tried to struggle, they softened due to the unfavorable environment. Given the good wheat harvest this year and the large factories still having foreign wheat as reserves, a surge of arrivals is expected, and the decline may be intensifying. As a result, the price for this month fell by 3 fen compared to the previous day, July fell by 5 fen, August, September, and October fell by 2 fen, and November fell by 1 fen. Regarding the new wheat situation, the arrival of cargo ships and boats has been surging in recent months. However, the factories' appetite has not been strong, and only limited quantities have been traded. Yesterday, 1,500 bags of Hezhou wheat were opened, priced at 3 taels and 9 qian, followed by 3 taels, 8 qian, and 7 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Foreign Rice Sales Continue <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for customer rice were completely stagnant. Neither local nor outside customers inquired. The owners were also unwilling to lower prices to sell. There were still thousands of bags of rice stored in the market, but most of them were of medium or lower quality. The amount of high-quality rice in the hands of the four households was also very small. The foreign rice market was slightly active yesterday, but prices weakened. According to reports, 720 bags of Saigon No. 1 were sold by this street and merchants from the Yangtze River, priced at 11 yuan to 10 yuan and 9 jiao. 200 tons of small broken rice were priced at 5 taels and 6 fen, for delivery at the end of June. New transactions and orders have not yet been concluded because prices in the producing areas are high and the Shanghai market is weak, making it difficult to make a profit.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Silk and Tea: Most Wuxi Cocoon Businesses Suspend Weighing <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Few Goods Available, Supply Can’t Meet Demand: Higher Prices for Superior Cocoons</p>
<p>This year, a total of over 130 cocoon businesses opened in the various markets and villages of Wuxi. However, the cocoon production was extremely poor, with only 27-28% of the usual harvest. It has only been 6-7 days since the weighing scales have opened, and the amount received by each business is only one-tenth to one-twelfth of that in previous years. The arrival of goods in the market is not strong, and businesses are competing to buy cocoons by increasing prices, leading to higher opening prices for superior cocoons, with a maximum of 85-86 yuan (improved variety of superior cocoons) and a minimum of 40 yuan (inferior native species). There are few goods and many businesses, making it impossible for supply to meet demand. In the past two days, there have been no more goods to collect. Most cocoon businesses in Qingcheng City, Tianxia City, Tianshang City, and Fu'an Township have suspended weighing. It is expected that the cocoon market in Xiyi will end this week.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Shanghai Factories Take the Opportunity to Cover Shorts as European Dealers Buy <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot sales of raw silk in the Shanghai foreign dealer market remained stagnant. However, European dealers generally believed that the price of raw silk processed by Shanghai factories had fallen to the lowest limit. Due to the shrinking exchange rate overseas, the opening price increased. Therefore, they took the opportunity to cover their shortages. However, because the cost of silk for each manufacturer was not low, they insisted on selling at high prices, making it difficult for transactions to be smooth. Yesterday, only Dayi and others imported 20 bales of old raw silk processed by white silk factories in Shanghai, and Xinfu imported 15 bales of raw silk processed by yellow silk factories in Shandong. The prices were firm.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Ping Shui Green Tea Sells Well to America <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea businesses such as Xiehe, Jinlong, Dede, and Tianxiang in Huzhou's Pingshui Green Tea area all started searching for goods. The total number of transactions in the city reached over 5,000 boxes, and the market was lively. However, this type of tea has always been sold at wholesale prices by merchants from all over the country. This year, due to the poor harvest in the producing areas and the high prices from Chinese merchants, the major merchants have been unable to open. Currently, most merchants are buying in small quantities. Among them, pearl tea is priced at 85 to 100 taels, which is 20 to 30 taels higher than before. The prices for other items such as needle tea and precious eyebrow tea are also similar. As for Luzhuang's precious eyebrow green tea, goods from Tunxi and Wuyuan arrived in Shanghai yesterday, but the Chinese merchants were unwilling to lower prices to sell, and transactions remained sparse.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Piece Goods: Piece Goods Continue to Rise <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market is becoming more firm. Although the gold market fell slightly yesterday, people's hearts were somewhat limited. The three ports have rebounded, and Osaka's price for patterned goods is again 2.5 li higher. Therefore, Tianjin merchants have strong buying intentions. The volume of spot and futures transactions for Zhongbing Yuehua velvet Huxinting serge and other items exceeded 300 pieces. Merchants from Sichuan also expressed buying intentions. Yesterday, there was appetite from three to four department stores for fine serge. It was not easy to find spot goods, so prices only rose and did not fall. Sijunzi Zhigong wool has been sold for 3 qian and 2 fen. Sanyou Tu was completely bought up by Tianjin merchants, and the current futures price is 3 qian and 4 fen. Even blue corduroy and color corduroy are popular. The price of fine serge, Shiqiu Gucheng, and Ling was consistently 3 qian and 9.5 fen yesterday. Huxinting was sold out at 3 qian and 4 fen. The price of summer goods at the beginning of the yuan has not increased. White crepe has already shown a turnaround. Rengou Xu is priced at 4 taels and 2 qian, and Wuye Tishu and Magic City have all been cleared at 4 taels and 1 qian. Due to the excessive decline in printed white-ground satin, it has attracted the attention of speculators. The prices all need to be cleared for 2 qian, and the estimated cost, plus storage and interest, is quite reasonable. Therefore, even goods priced at 1 qian and 8 fen yesterday have disappeared.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Sugar Market: 300 Tons of Dumped Dutch Brown Sugar Surge <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's telegrams from the sugar market production areas: The current price of Cuban sugar is still 1.3125, the New York sugar futures price for September is 1.28, December is 1.37, March of next year is 1.44, and May is 1.50. Compared to the previous telegram, only December and May of next year have each risen by 1 point, and there have been no changes in other months. The current price of Javanese sugar and June futures are both 8 guilders, and July and August are 8.125, with little change compared to the previous period. The association's market transactions were very quiet, with both buying and selling sluggish. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white was 11 taels and 5 qian, and No. 20 medium granulated white was 10 taels, 8 qian, and 5 fen. Transactions were very few. The Japanese sugar market also declined slightly. N Mark was 11 taels and 3 qian, J Mark was 11 taels, 7 qian, and 2.5 fen, SH Mark was 11 taels and 5 fen, YT Mark was 11 taels and 3 qian, YRO was 10 taels, 9 qian, and 5 fen, and TP Mark was 11 taels and 7 qian. The trend was stable. Throwing Goods: The Jicheng foreign firm sold 200 tons of Dutch brown sugar No. 8-9 loaded in July, August, and September, priced at 5 Dutch guilders. At the same time, Nan Chenglong also offered 100 tons at the same price. The market was not unusual. Huaxin offered 1,000 bags of spot coarse granulated white at 11 taels and 5 qian per bag, but the demand was not strong. The original amount of over 3,000 bags could not be sold out at once.</p>

<h3 id="e266">Marshal Foch's Diary of the European War <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>"The Commanders-in-Chief of the British, French, and American forces continue to command their troops. If any Commander-in-Chief feels that General Foch's instructions are placing his troops in a dangerous position, he has the right to appeal to his home government."</p>
<p>Mr. Lloyd George came from London to attend, landed at Boulogne, and drove to Bommiers. Mr. Clemenceau had arrived earlier. On the way, Mr. George encountered retreating British troops. Seeing their poor morale and dispirited state, he knew the situation was unfavorable. Therefore, he arrived at the meeting with a disheartened impression, quite late.</p>
<p>However, he soon shook off this depressed demeanor and regained his characteristic energy. At the meeting, he declared to me: "The British people trust you. Your appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces is unanimously welcomed in our country."</p>
<p>After the meeting, as we left the room, he said to me with his usual cheerful manner, "Now, I bet, who is it going to be? Ludendorff or Foch?" I calmly replied, "You must first back me, and then you will win. Because Ludendorff must break through our army, and he is now incapable of doing so. As for us, our current task is to stop him. We are very confident about this. Afterwards, when the time comes, we will break through him. That is another question. How far we can go will soon be seen."</p>
<p>The Bommiers Agreement could not fully accommodate my suggestions, and therefore failed to extend my authority to control the entire Western Front from the North Sea to the Adriatic Sea, or all Allied forces fighting there. However, it already contained the elements of commanding the French line of battle. The French line was the main theater of war, and the American, British, and French forces fighting there were also the main Allied forces. But Mr. Clemenceau, having now obtained the approval of the British and American governments for this new plan, certainly preferred to limit the authority of the Allied Commander-in-Chief to this theater and these three armies, pending the maturity of the opportunity. Once this result was achieved, he reserved the possibility of seeking future expansion of the agreement to include the Italian theater, on the one hand, and the Belgian forces, on the other, and the Italian forces.</p>
<p>The motion to include Italy was studied by the Supreme War Council on May 2nd at Abbeville. Mr. Orlando and Mr. Sonnino, on behalf of the Italian government, declared that they could not unconditionally agree to the Bommiers Agreement. However, for the sake of compromise, they proposed to distinguish between the command of the Italian line and the Italian army. This plan was agreed to by other governments and contained the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Italian line will henceforth be under the control of General Foch, according to the Doulens Agreement.</p>
<p>(2) As for the Italian army, it will only be under his control when other Allied forces arrive outside the Alps and fight under his command in a similar situation as in France.</p>
<p>This restriction by the Italian government still allowed the Allied Commander-in-Chief to inspect the Italian line and, when necessary, to implement his strategy, taking advantage of the possibility of crossing the Alpine war zone.</p>
<p>Regarding the Belgian forces, the Supreme War Council discussed this issue on July 3rd at Versailles. At that time, the Allied forces were preparing to launch an offensive in France. It was expected that the Belgian forces would participate in this battle, and it would be best to put them under my control, just like other Allied forces. However, Major General Gillain, Chief of Staff of the Belgian Army, formally opposed this proposal, citing the Belgian Constitution. As a result, no understanding could be reached.</p>
<p>In fact, this uncooperative attitude mostly arose on principle and was not immutable. A few weeks later, the King of Belgium did not hesitate to accept the task of directing the Belgian, French, British, and American Allied forces fighting in France, according to the Allied Commander-in-Chief's dispositions.</p>
<p>On May 2nd, the Allied governments decided to abolish the Executive Committee established three months earlier, as it was no longer necessary. On May 14th, I assumed the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in France.</p>
<p>But this was only a formal procedure to define my authority on paper. In practice, how this newly created Allied Commander-in-Chief would exercise his authority remained to be seen.</p>
<p>In early April 1918, the situation was still precarious. The front line was extended due to repeated enemy victories. Soldiers, exhausted and hoarse, had to reverse the declining trend. There was no more time for procrastination.</p>
<p>On his part, General Pétain advanced the Fifth Army along the Somme further north. This army, because it did not want to launch an offensive at that time, was replenished by drawing from the reserves. He also moved the Arras Army Group westward. This army group had two divisions, part of which advanced to the right bank of the Arras River. He further transferred the First Cavalry Corps from Andelys to Omer.</p>
<p>General Fayolle was ordered to immediately move the reserves on the left flank, in order to assist the British Fourth Army in the Lusem area in times of urgent need.</p>
<p>Finally, instructions were given to General Maistre, commander of the Tenth Army, to handle the military affairs in front of Arras. If the enemy attacked, the main line of defense must be firmly held with all strength. The operational steps were prescribed for him and the Third Army in the instructions. The initial deployment and the method of his participation in the war were also indicated to him.</p>
<p>When arranging for the French army to participate in the war between Arras and the Somme River, I also paid attention to doing my best to assist the British Commander-in-Chief, because he was unsettled by the material and spiritual difficulties of the Battle of Flanders. On the 12th, I decided to increase the reinforcements that had begun to be supplied to him two days earlier.</p>
<p>I ordered the reserve forces in the Omer area, the Second Cavalry Corps, to depart for Saint-Omer. After arriving on the 13th, they were prepared to join the French 133rd Division to reinforce the British Second Army.</p>
<p>General Robillot, commander of the Second Cavalry Corps, came to Sarcus (note: my headquarters had moved to Sarcus on April 7th, three miles northwest of Grandvilliers) to receive instructions. When instructing him on his operational tasks, I specifically instructed him to do his utmost to maintain contact between the British First and Second Armies.</p>
<p>The strategic outline is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Fully support the two flanks of the gap, continuing to occupy the Kemmelberg-Mount Cassel line in the north, and continuing to occupy the Beaucourt-Saint-Amiens line in the south, to the northeast.</p>
<p>(2) Between these firmly held flanks, occupy key points to the east to prevent the enemy from advancing.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e267">Fudan Drama Society Performance of "The Liar" <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Date: Set for Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>Location: Ningbo Native Place Association</p>
<p>Since the last performance of "Cyrano de Bergerac," the Fudan Drama Society has been preparing for its eleventh major performance. The play is the famous work "The Liar" by the British playwright Jones. It was performed once at Fudan University on the evening of the first of this month. It has now been decided to present a grand performance at the Ningbo Native Place Association today and tomorrow. This play has been adapted and translated by the Society, so it is very suitable for the national situation and has no defects of disharmony. In addition, the scenery design is magnificent and elegant, the plot of the play is humorous and witty, and the actors are carefully selected and are all rich in stage experience. It is heard that the ticket sales points are at the North Star, Guanghua, and Modern bookstores on the Fourth Road, and the seat prices are half a yuan and one yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Fudan's "The Liar" <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>"The theatrical atmosphere in Shanghai has been extremely quiet lately."</p>
<p>Everyone breathing in this metropolis of three million people feels this way. It's true, the Southern Country Drama Society has disintegrated, there is no news of the Drama Association rehearsing, the Xinyou Drama Troupe seems to have lost its energy since the so-called difficult drama movement, and the Modern Drama Society, which once worked hard to promote the mobile theater movement, has also gone back to their own dreams and stopped its work. However, various school drama societies, which had been active in succession during the so-called theatrical year of the 19th year of the Republic, have also declined and fallen into silence, following the craze of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>However, the theater groups in Shanghai have not all disappeared, have they? Aren't the newly established Qing'e Drama Society and Su Ni Drama Society preparing for public performances?</p>
<p>The Fudan Drama Society has made many contributions to the struggling Chinese theater scene with its ten consecutive performances, and last year it made a great effort to perform the great "Cyrano de Bergerac," which no Chinese troupe dared to perform and which required fifty or sixty people to be on stage. Now, they are gathering their spirits again and rehearsing their eleventh performance.</p>
<p>The play to be performed this time is "The Liar," a masterpiece by the great British playwright Jones. "The Liar" has been a sensation in the European and American theater circles in the past and has received a lot of good reviews.</p>
<p>The author loudly calls out in the play that it is not worth it for a person to sacrifice his honor, reputation, national responsibility, conscience, and everything else for the sake of a woman. In our country, there are quite a few people who abandon the dangers of the nation and the country because they are infatuated with women, and this should be a great wake-up call.</p>
<p>"The Liar," a comedy of life, satirizes the marriage disputes between men and women in England at that time and points the way for men and women who have lost their way. Now, Mr. Zhu Duanjun of the Society has adapted and translated it to suit the national situation of China.</p>
<p>The play tells the story of a wealthy businessman from Southeast Asia who happens to come to Shanghai for a visit and meets several married women, and falls into a furious tide of love with the most beautiful one. With this as the beginning, a story that is both humorous and witty, profound, and full of life's meaning unfolds.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, that couple happened to meet at a hotel on the coast of Wusong, and happened to be seen by the younger brother of the woman's husband. How could this be? The crime of a secret meeting at the hotel was then added to their shoulders. From this misunderstanding, the third act, which is the most interesting and the most important part of the whole play, unfolds.</p>
<p>Helpless, they discussed with their relatives and friends how to hide it from their husband. Should they tell him the truth? That would only make things worse. It was decided to create a perfect lie. The lie agreed upon by a few people was gradually joined by most people. There were actually three male and three female characters who worked together to create the lie, reaching the most brilliant moment of the whole play. But unfortunately, because there were too many people involved, the lie that was expected to be perfect unintentionally revealed flaws, almost leading to an uncontrollable situation.</p>
<p>The story turns around here, from a couple who are about to break up to a path of rekindling their old love and ending. In the last act, there are a few famous lines that can be offered to the men and women who are living a miserable life in the air of divorce fever: "Don't think that you can neglect your wife after you get married. You can't. Now you have married the most beautiful woman in Shanghai, but if you don't continue to love her, someone else will love her. There's nothing to say, this is the tragedy of life."</p>
<p>In this play, there are six ladies on stage, breaking the record for the most female actors needed in previous performances by various theater groups. If the stage were changed to a domestic goods mall, some people might think it was a fashion exhibition. But it's not, they are all young women who love drama and are willing to work hard for it.</p>
<p>They, these few actresses, are the beautiful princesses in the Eastern Palace that people often praise. The most beautiful princesses are all gathered in this play. If it is necessary to introduce them in advance, it is also possible to say a little bit about them.</p>
<p>The first one to be mentioned is Ms. Liang Peishu. She has a talent for acting, needless to say, the subtlety of her expressions, the brightness of her lines, etc., have already been established. Originally, she played the female lead in the great Cyrano de Bergerac. This time, the passionate female lead is</p>
<p>Ms. Li Lian, she is right, her acting skills are very skilled, and her stage experience is extraordinary and abundant. She has played many roles, worthy of being a member trained by a famous director. There is also her sister,</p>
<p>Ms. Qin Quan, is also a talented actress in the new drama world. She doesn't care about the importance of the role, she is learning on the road to success. The one who needs a secluded and virtuous personality in this play is</p>
<p>Ms. Ouyang, she matches the personality in the play. She sings very well, and when she speaks her lines, it sounds like a clear warbling of birds.</p>
<p>The other ladies, I can't introduce them one by one. In short, they are all who have shown their talents in the spoken drama world. Because there are so many women in this play, the title of the play was once changed to "The Lying Women."</p>
<p>If you are looking forward to seeing these ladies and this clever plot, coincidentally, it will be performed at the Ningbo Native Place Association today. The performance says,</p>
