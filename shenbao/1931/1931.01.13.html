<p>此重大問題在此一年之中絞無數有力者之心思腦血以求解决此問題之方法然而方法雖有效而終不能挽回此大勢之所趨其故何他蓋以成此大勢者非一朝一夕之故至於今日至成古人所謂積重難返而欲以一時之問爲之挽救其效决無大騐也况又有無數之人出其智力能力以增益此大勢而不怠如行舟然逆水挽舟者其力已有限况更有順水以推舟者乎故由今之道行今之事世界失業之多方興而未艾也</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>海客</p>
<p>富翁（太病將死。在病榻上掙扎着说。）丨我快将死了。身後的幾個錢。你得好好的保守。其子丨父親。我自當好好保守。不敢浪用父親辛苦掙來的錢。</p>
<p>富翁人家久我的錢。有好幾注。我把姓名說出來。你一一記下。（於是說了好幾人的姓名。）</p>
<p>其子丨我聽說父親欠人的錢。也有幾注。請將他們的姓名一并說出來。以便歸還。</p>
<p>富翁丨欠人的錢。你不用管。他們死時。自會像我一樣的把人欠的錢告知他們的兒子。</p>
<p>新來的女僕（對伊的女主人說）丨太太。我不願意在這裏工作了。</p>
<p>女主人丨爲甚麼。你來得不多幾天。怎麼就要走了。</p>
<p>新來的女僕丨只爲那Ｃ先生夜夜來探望小姐。於我的名譽有關。</p>
<p>女主人丨奇了。他是小姐的男朋友。和你全不相干。</p>
<p>新來的女僕丨可是我的年紀還輕。面孔又生得不錯。左右鄰舍。怕都要當做Ｃ先生是探望我來的。這豈不是於我的名譽有關麼。</p>
<p>甲女丨王小姐欠了成衣匠不少的錢。要他的未婚夫一起還清。然後肯嫁他。</p>
<p>乙女丨那麼他已給伊還清了沒有。</p>
<p>甲女丨他沒有這許多錢。所以在勸伊嫁給成衣匠了。</p>
<h3>鼻能報時的新發現</h3>
<p>陳叔平</p>
<p>世界人類。除了患梅毒的丶大家都生着一個鼻子。但我們祗知它有嗅覺。專司呼吸。不料它還有報時的功用呢。諸君聽了。定要說在下在那裏吹牛。以爲鼻上既沒有數目標明。文沒有長短兩針。怎能報告待長呢。須知鼻的報告。全在通塞上辨別。祗有自己覺得。不是報告他人的。在了自發現鼻的通塞和時辰有關後，即詳加研究。始知每個鼻孔報告一個時辰。而且男女不同。十二個時辰。男子左鼻孔報子時。右鼻孔報丑時。以此類推。女子却相反。子時在右面。辨別的方法。譬如到了子時。我們便覺得左鼻孔較右面的呼吸上來得通暢一些。女子則覺右面的通。在兩個時辰交界的時候。試騐起來。功效更爲顯著。諸君不信。可當場試騐。不過預先聲明。傷風鼻塞的時候。和自嗚鐘停了一樣。决試不出甚麼效騐來。據友人秦濟世醫生的意見。以爲鼻能報時。係事之常情。毫沒有甚麼神秘怪異。只因人的身體。是一部很複雜的機器。氣血流行。日夜不息。結果遂使鼻孔呼吸通塞隨時變更。這番見解。理由尙稱充足。茲以不忍獨秘。特錄實自由談。公諸同文。不過鐘表店老閭見了。恐怕要疑惑在下搶他們的生意呢。一笑。</p>
<h3>好字戒</h3>

<h3>北平秋訊</h3>
<p>謹愼</p>
<p>言衣花衫泰斗程玉霜。蜚聲京滬。載譽北歸。即應中和戲院之聘。每週演唱三天。（星期一二三）座無隙地。近來禁絕烟酒。嗓子絕佳。故大受戲迷之歡迎。十二月二十九晚。商界煩演武家坡弓硯丶</p>
<p>緣。加凳滿塲。平人詫爲僅見，三十晚大風雪。演寶蓮燈。上座九百餘人。三十一晚風雪不止。演硃痕記。上座千餘人。是晚尙小雲演全本白蛇傳。加演　蜡廟。上座三百餘人。荀慧生演元宵謎。上座四百餘人。北平國曆除夕。諸名伶競演佳劇。觀衆風雪勿阻。頗有昇平景象焉。</p>
<p>元旦。玉霜早車赴律。應明星戲院之聘。一晚演玉堂春。二晚演碧玉簪。三晚演柳迎春。四晚演金鎖記。票價三元。已於三十日以前預售一空。玉霜於講習國學之暇。創編新劇。擬於一年之內排演十本。均以有思想有意義爲準繩。現在已脫稿者。爲荒山淚。李石曾先生大爲贊賞。改名祈禱和平。正屬稿者。一名和平之神。一名春閨夢。玉霜努力藝術。可見一斑云李石曾先生嘗言江蘇省政府某應長。曩在北平觀玉霜劇。謂玉霜如到南京演唱。國是當可和平云。玉霜十一月赴京演義務戲。適值南北統一四中全會開幕之時。某君預言有中。故京中稱玉霜爲和平之神。</p>

<p>新年四號之晚。大新綢緞局主人王延松。盛宴各界於大西洋到有五百餘人。黨政商號各界人士均有。直可謂爲上海各界慶賀新年之大宴會也。</p>
<p>席間王延松君說明創設大新之志願。是提倡國貨。所以凡屬優美國產綢緞。無不費盡心力。廣爲搜集。王君對於美字。亦有發揮。略謂美是含有時代性的。以前女子最時髦的三寸金蓮。現在看起來。並不漂亮。可是美的東西是抽象的。什麼在西能代表美呢。俗諺說。佛要金裝。人要衣裝。可知衣服是根可以代表美的云云。　　與王君並坐者。爲一女賓。作學生裝。人多誤作女主人。竟有人以此詢王君者。筏經王君說明。乃係市財政局長唐伯耆令妹。新聲通訊社之女記者唐乃炘女士也。</p>
<p>中西女熟高材生襲某。有大新時裝迷。蓋其每月必向大新時裝部定製新裝二三襲。因此頗引起同學之注意。經其介紹定製者爲數甚夥。是日亦翩然戾止。逢人便說﹁新時裝好﹂後以另有他事。未終席即去。</p>
<h3>巴黎物語（二）</h3>
<p>六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>這張片子名呌﹁避罪口實﹂（Ａｌｉｂｉ這字很難譯。大意是犯罪者狡稱當被告事件發生時本人在犯罪地以外的旁的地方的一種答辯）。是一九二九年的美國出品。我們可以想到這大槪是好萊塢最後攝製的一張不假Ｍｉｃｒｏｐｈｏｎｅ帮助的無聲影片。這片子頗值得注意。我個人還很以將來沒有許多機會遇到這類影片爲憾。</p>
<p>﹁避罪口實﹂絕不是什麼重要作品。這裡面並沒有一個了不得的明星。但這片子却可說是美國人從事電影事業多年得來的經騐的結晶。一切束縛演員動作的處所。一切使人覺得不近情理的地方都嚴格的避去了。這片子只留着一種人類永遠相爭相砍的悲劇的壯觀。這悲劇很簡單地縮印在警察與盜匪的爭鬬裡面。名片﹁芝加哥之夜﹂便是這類影片的代表模型。</p>
<p>在這片內我們可以見得出那些最好的影片所具有的純樸美。演員的面影在銀幕上顯得非常自然。實在的。我覺得在無論什麼影片內。情節和穿挿都不過占次要地位。最要緊的還是演員的表情。一流盼。一抬手。都與全片的價值有關。演員要做到使觀衆看電影時不覺得在看電影。簡直生活電影裡面。聞直參加在電影裡面。那才是妤景片。那才是值得稱許的演員。</p>
<p>﹁避罪口實﹂的情節如下。</p>
<p>當銀幕初啓時。一個靑年男子被放出監牢。有三個人在門口等著他。一個有年紀的男子。一個淫賣婦和一個少女。這有年紀的男子是一個酒店主人。爲慶祝那靑年的出獄起見。他家裡預備好了晚餐。大家開懷暢飮。飮至半酣。同桌裡面有一個男子跑來問那少女約安的住址。約安很大方的給了他。</p>
<p>回家時。約安見着伊父親（地位很高的警官）和他的朋友督察湯姆在談話。這是第十次湯姆要求約安嫁給他。但這也是第十次約安回答他道。我是一個警察的女兒。這已夠了。我不願更做一個警察的妻室。湯姆怏怏而去。</p>
<p>是日來賓。有五六十歲之老頭子。亦有二三十歲的新青年。座中有某文學家。戲題十六字云。﹁男女都有。老少無欺。一新耳目。皆大歡喜﹂。四句中嵌大新兩字。並描寫當時來賓之各種脚色齊備。甚爲確切云。</p>

No interest has been paid on this loan to date. 2) China has violated the contract not to build parallel lines competing with the trunk lines of the South Manchurian Railway. It is reported that regarding the first point, Japan intends to negotiate the most lenient repayment terms. Regarding the second point, if a guarantee can be agreed upon so that the South Manchurian Railway can continue to transport the merchants originally transported by the railway, Japan may not delve into the violation of the contract. It is reported that Kimura was also ordered to declare to the authorities of the three eastern provinces that Japan is willing to cooperate and is willing to provide the authorities of the three eastern provinces with cash under appropriate guarantees to implement their railway plans.

<h3>Relief for World Unemployment</h3>
<p>Relief for world unemployment is becoming more urgent, and the number of unemployed people in the world is increasing. According to the International Labor Office, the number of unemployed people in the world in December last year was the highest in Germany, exceeding 4 million, followed by the United Kingdom with 2.3 million, Italy with more than 300,000, Austria with 262,000, and Yugoslavia with more than 4,000. As for the United States, the exact number cannot be obtained, and it is estimated to be between 5 million and 7 million. The number of unemployed people in the world in just these few countries is more than 10 million. Moreover, in addition to these countries, there are still many unemployed people in South America, Central America, and Eastern countries. It can be said that this is a serious problem for the whole world.</p>
<p>This major problem has caused countless powerful people to rack their brains and blood to find a solution to this problem in the past year. However, although the method is effective, it cannot reverse the trend of the situation. What is the reason? This is because the cause of this trend is not a matter of a day or two. It has reached the point where the ancients called it a heavy burden that is difficult to reverse, and wanting to save it in a moment of inquiry will have no great effect. Moreover, there are countless people who use their intelligence and ability to increase this trend without slacking off. Like rowing a boat, those who reverse the water to save the boat have limited strength, and there are even more people who push the boat with the water. Therefore, according to the current way of doing things, the rise in world unemployment is not yet at its end.</p>

<h3>Riots Occur in the Philippines</h3>

<h3>Difficulties for the Japanese Parliament Lie in the House of Peers</h3>
<p>Will Use Fiscal Issues to Criticize the Current Cabinet</p>
<p>The Entire Minseito Party Supports Kijūrō Shidehara</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Dentsu): Although the government has an absolute majority in the House of Representatives, the anti-government atmosphere in the House of Peers is evident. They are observing weaknesses such as fiscal issues, economic issues, and internal strife. Furthermore, there will be considerable difficulties in the House of Peers for the Labor Union Law, the Election Law Amendment, the Tenant Law, the Telephone Privatization Bill, and other important bills. Whether they can be passed smoothly is questionable. Even if Prime Minister Hamaguchi takes a firm stance, considering the current atmosphere in the House of Peers and the Privy Council, it is feared that it will not be so simple and unimpeded. Although the Acting Prime Minister issue has been resolved, if Prime Minister Hamaguchi cannot attend Parliament, the government led by Kijūrō Shidehara as commander will inevitably face bitter battles. Moreover, the House of Peers did not include measures to counter the economic downturn in the previous budget, so the House of Peers is determined to pursue this matter to the end. Although the government wants to avoid their attack by issuing unemployment bonds, the House of Peers will demand an explanation for their disregard for their recommendations in order to criticize the government.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Dentsu): The young members of the Minseito Party met at the Kujunai Tokyo Hall at 5:00 PM this afternoon.

After mutual consultation, they agreed that Prime Minister Hamaguchi will definitely be able to attend Parliament after mid-February and that they should not hold different opinions. They should only support Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara as the acting Prime Minister. The overall opinion was largely unanimous, so in form and substance, they have already supported Kijūrō Shidehara.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 12th (Dentsu): According to a person close to Railway Minister Emoto, some believe that this incident was caused by the recent heavy snowstorm, but the facts do not seem to be so. The cause is currently under investigation. It is feared that it was caused by damaged tracks. I usually strictly order all railways to pay attention to prevent accidents, and I am truly regretful that this unfortunate event has occurred. We will have ample methods of comforting the dead and injured.</p>
<h3>The Attitude of American Financiers Towards Chinese Bank Loans</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Take Concrete Action Until There is a Specific Plan</p>
<p>New York, 11th (Reuters): American financiers are unwilling to take concrete action on the proposal to lend 100 million yuan to China. According to their views expressed to Reuters, first, this proposal is still vague. Who is the borrower and who is the lender have not been fully clarified. In any case, a public offering of loans is clearly out of the question, so an international government bond is the only option. No one can say what kind of success this proposal will have until there is a specific plan. Canada and the United States seem to be quite close to this issue, but it should be noted that the chances of success are very slim unless their plan receives the full support of Britain, France, and Japan. As far as is known, the discussion of this issue is limited to North America. The attitude of the United States is not altruistic. If American businesses cannot benefit from this, then the United States will not do it. Furthermore, the United States' previous experience in the China International Banking Consortium was not entirely pleasant. This is also one of the reasons why the United States is taking this matter seriously. Senator Pittman's plan, which has been heavily publicized in American newspapers, should be supported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but Congress may not take action simply because of the committee's support.</p>
<p>New York, 11th (Associated Press): Qualified observers here and in Washington are reluctant to criticize the widely rumored plan to grant China a silver loan, as China has not yet requested a silver loan. The International Silver Market Committee, which is currently meeting in Salt Lake City, can only informally discuss ways to increase and consolidate silver prices. Discussions on the silver market began several months ago, and some have suggested convening an international silver market conference to seek solutions. It is widely rumored that Canada intends to lend a large amount of money to China, but it is known that no government or banking consortium has ever stated that they have contacted China about the loan. Therefore, all recent discussions are just hot air and aim to attract public attention to the silver market. Others say that China is not currently suffering from a silver shortage, and that injecting a large amount of silver into China would only cause silver prices to fall further. Although the International Silver Market Committee has approved the proposal to lend 200 million ounces of silver to China, investigations have revealed that this proposal actually came from silver producers, who hope to sell all their goods to China at higher silver prices, and not from the Chinese government. A month ago, Chinese Finance Minister Song denied reports that China planned to borrow from foreign countries. The International Silver Market Committee in Salt Lake City, in addition to supporting the idea of lending silver to China to raise silver prices, cannot take any other actions that would benefit the silver market.</p>
<h3>The Annual Report of an American Company on the Silver Market</h3>
<p>Fixing Silver Prices Depends on International Cooperation</p>
<p>India's Silver Sales Policy Needs to Change Urgently</p>
<p>New York, 12th (Reuters): The American company Handy &amp; Harman released its annual report on the silver market today, stating that any plan to fix or increase silver prices must understand the world relations of silver. It also said that international cooperation is more likely to achieve this goal than individual efforts by countries. The supply caused by the destruction of silver coins could be reduced, the Indian government's policy of selling silver reserves could be changed, silver coins of certain countries could be re-minted, and new uses for silver in industry could be invented. Any one of these would cause the silver market to tend stronger, but even without this assistance, silver prices are bound to rise when world commerce recovers. When China and India sell their goods at higher prices and restore their purchasing power, creating a better trade balance, and when the conditions in China and India allow for greater production activity, we will see a large increase in the silver consumption in the Far East. After all, the 750 million people in these two countries will never immediately change their centuries-old habit of using silver and not use silver as currency. The company estimates last year's silver production at 243,700,000 ounces, about 17,000,000 ounces less than the previous year, of which Mexico produced 105,700,000 ounces, the United States 50,400,000 ounces, Canada 26,200,000 ounces, South America 22,700,000 ounces, and other places 38,700,000 ounces.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 12th (Jiji Press): Governor-General of Taiwan Ishizuka arrived in Tokyo last night. He met with Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda this morning to report on the Wushe Incident and formally expressed his intention to resign. Minister Matsuda also considered it unavoidable and immediately approved it. The current Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, Mr. Ota, has been internally appointed as his successor.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Burmese and Chinese</h3>
<p>Using Knives, Axes, Clubs, and Stones</p>
<p>Mutual Deaths and Injuries</p>
<p>Rangoon, 3rd (Reuters): A major conflict broke out between Burmese and Chinese in the Lama Road area of West Rangoon, causing great disturbance. The police fired shots twice to stop it, resulting in three deaths and twenty-five injuries.</p>

Including the previous incident, there are now a total of ten deaths and sixty-five injuries. The authorities are now adopting strict measures to prevent the spread of the unrest.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 5th (Reuters): The disturbance between the Chinese and Burmese began over a trivial matter. Both sides attacked each other with knives and axes, and clubs and stones. The police then fired shots to clear the streets. Although elders from both sides came forward to mediate, the unrest broke out again yesterday. The military police were dispatched to suppress it. Currently, gentry from both sides are running around in the riot areas, announcing the restoration of peace. It has been verified that there are ten deaths, and the hospital reports the number of injured as eighty-five, but there are many who have not reported it.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>On January 12th at 9:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held its 94th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the Great Hall. Central Committee members Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingheng, Chen Lifu, and staff from various departments and commissions, along with guests, totaling approximately 500-600 people, attended. Wu Jingheng presided and after the ceremony, Wang Chonghui reported on: (1) The matter of abolishing likin: The harm of likin has long been criticized worldwide. In the past, the system designated likin as local tax and land tax as national tax. Local authorities regarded likin as a source of profit and wished to preserve it permanently, creating a deeply entrenched situation. Although its abolition had been advocated repeatedly, it could not be realized. The Central Government, understanding the crux of the matter, first changed the system, designating likin as national tax and land tax as local tax. Now that the nation considers likin an outdated policy, it resolutely ordered its abolishment. After the abolishment, on the negative side, it can remove years of corruption and eliminate unnecessary burdens on the people. On the positive side, it can facilitate the flow of goods, benefiting both politics and economy. (2) The matter of amnesty: The government has shown leniency towards former political prisoners, restoring their freedom and providing them with a path to self-renewal. The further hope is that those pardoned can bravely correct their past mistakes and become useful citizens of the nation in the future. (3) The matter of rectifying academic atmosphere: Young students do not focus on cultivating their studies and are often incited by others, causing disturbances, leading to instability in schools. Furthermore, with their minds distracted, their studies are neglected, and their talents cannot be developed, running contrary to the government's aim of cultivating talent. This is the greatest loss to the nation. We often lament the lack of talent needed for domestic enterprises, resorting to sourcing them from abroad and relying on foreigners, which is truly distressing. Now that Chairman Chiang is determined to rectify the academic atmosphere, maintain school order, and enhance the value of education, it is hoped that young people can reflect deeply, immerse themselves in learning with revolutionary spirit, strictly adhere to discipline, and become independent and useful talents after their studies, shouldering great responsibilities for the nation. (4) The matter of the National Assembly: It is imperative to follow Sun Yat-sen's will and convene a National Assembly. Its main purpose is to gather the spirit and strength of the whole nation to plan for national unification and construction. The former Beijing Parliament's members mostly sought personal gain and disregarded national affairs, leading to political corruption and an irreparable situation. This time, in convening the National Assembly, it is hoped that provinces will elect outstanding representatives who will prioritize national prosperity and the people's well-being and make positive contributions, living up to the heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the people. (5) The matter of abolishing unequal treaties: Our country is bound by unequal treaties, hindering political and economic independence and lacking progress. Negotiations are actively underway. Regarding the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction, although not yet fully settled, the whole nation must have a determination to fight for sovereignty and not stop until the goal is achieved. Countries that have suffered from consular jurisdiction, such as Japan, Siam, and Turkey, have already abolished it successively. Only our country still has this evil system in place. It is hoped that we will work together to make progress in domestic rule of law and enhance the nation's status, seeking international sympathy and achieving abolishment in the shortest possible time through our own efforts, not through being forced, so as not to fail Sun Yat-sen's will. The report concluded and the meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>The National Government also held its Memorial Week on the same morning. Attendees included Wu Jingheng, Zhang Renjie, Hu Hanmin, Chiang Kai-shek, Niu Yongjian, Zhu Peide, Wang Boqun, Liu Shangqing, Ma Fuxiang, Wang Zhengting, Liu Ruiheng, He Yaozu, and over three hundred staff and guests. After Chiang Kai-shek presided and performed the usual ceremony, Hu Hanmin reported on Sun Yat-sen's teachings: the people have freedom, but officials and soldiers do not. Now, during the process of reclaiming concessions and abolishing consular jurisdiction, military personnel and officials of the National Government often go to the Shanghai concessions for entertainment, which violates Sun Yat-sen's teachings and provides foreigners with grounds to refute our demands for reclaiming concessions. This is a failure of officials and soldiers. It is hoped that this habit will be corrected in the future. The report concluded and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Song Ziwen Arrives in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Personally Welcomes Him at the Station</p>
<p>Mission is to Handle Compensatory Taxes</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: This time, the abolition of likin is being implemented nationwide. Although the eight provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan are in a period of military consolidation with strained finances, they must implement the unified policy of the central government. Therefore, Deputy Commander Zhang resolutely announced compliance with the central government's order to abolish likin agencies on January 1st. However, the financial situation of the provinces south of Shandong and Henan has long been understood by the central government. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance is planning the overall compensatory tax after the abolition of likin, and will collect unified tax and special tax on the day of the abolition of likin. The eight northern provinces and regions are farther from the central government, and the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, etc., have long been controlled by Yan Xishan, and the central government has not yet understood their financial situation. Therefore, the central government has not yet considered the plan for regional taxation, and Deputy Commander Zhang has not discussed it with the central government due to the urgency of time when he was in Beijing. Recently, after announcing the abolition of likin, Zhang immediately requested the central government for instructions on the implementation of compensatory taxes, but the exchange of letters and telegrams felt insufficient. Therefore, Finance Minister Song Ziwen went north from Beijing on the evening of the 7th to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang to discuss everything. Due to not being able to catch the Jinpu train, he chartered a special train to Tianjin, following the Jinpu train schedule. He met with Han Fuju in Jinan for talks and had dinner at the Sanmei Building. After the meal, he left for Tianjin. After passing Cangzhou, he encountered a sudden storm, and the train slowed down. It arrived at the Tianjin station this morning (9th) at 8:30 AM. The provincial and municipal authorities sent military police to welcome him at both the east and west stations. Provincial Chairman Wang Shuchang, Mayor Zang Qifang, Customs Superintendent Han Linsheng, Finance Commissioner Jing Youyan, and Finance Director Yao Hong all accompanied him to Xigu and boarded the special train together, accompanying him to the east station. Deputy Commander Zhang led his subordinates to personally welcome him at the east station. After the train stopped, Zhang boarded the train and shook hands with Song and got off the train, taking photos outside the train to commemorate the occasion. After getting off the train, Zhang and Song rode in the same car to the Kiesling Western Restaurant, set up by the Germans in the special zone, for breakfast. After talking until 11:00 AM, they went together to the official residence of the director of the Beining Railway Bureau on Haihe Road North. Song stayed there. This official residence is beautifully built and is one of the most outstanding residences in Tianjin. Zhang specially borrowed it from the Railway Bureau. After Zhang and Song arrived at the official residence, officials from Tianjin and the economic community came to visit. In the afternoon, Zhang briefly discussed the financial situation of the provinces with Song, and they discussed it again in the evening. According to Song, this trip was to visit Deputy Commander Zhang to discuss the compensatory measures after the abolition of likin, and to meet with local finance officials. He will stay in Tianjin for several days and will return south after a general decision is made. The entire plan will be announced after a meeting with Zhang, because the plan must be based on facts and cannot be decided without consultation. Song was accompanied by Secretary Zhu Zhicheng, Counselor Shen Yiqing, Inspector He Shaofen, Director Song Wenbin, Yang Jiqi, and five others, as well as a platoon of National Government guards. They took two special trains, with the guards living on the train and the staff living in the official residence. (January 9th)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Proposal for Shanxi Province's Post-Disaster Recovery</h3>
<p>Reduce the Army and Consolidate Finances</p>
<p>Convert Armories to Other Uses</p>
<p>Statements by Petition Representatives</p>
<p>Although Shanxi Province seems to be stabilizing since Yan Xishan's departure, its internal organization still needs to be actively carried out. It is now reported that various sectors of the military and civilians in the province, as well as fellow villagers from various places abroad, cannot bear to see Shanxi, which has been intact for many years, fall into chaos. They regard Kong Xiangxi, the newly appointed Minister of Industry, as a pioneer of the revolution in the province, who has always been enthusiastic about promoting various undertakings in the province's political and social fields, and has personally founded many of them. They believe that Kong is the most suitable person to return to Shanxi to govern. Therefore, they publicly elected representatives to petition in Beijing, and letters and telegrams have been sent frequently. The Shanxi Military Aspiration Association, the Local Autonomy Association, the Post-Disaster Problem Coordination Association, and the fellow villagers associations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin have urged Kong to return. A reporter happened to meet a representative from Shanxi Province and asked about Kong's attitude. According to his statement: Reporter (Q): The military and civilian sectors of your province, as well as fellow villagers from various places abroad, unanimously advocate inviting Minister Kong to return to preside over provincial affairs, and have publicly elected representatives, including you, to petition the government and Kong in Beijing. Letters and telegrams have been sent frequently with sincere words. Minister Kong must have been obliged to accept. What is Kong's attitude? Can you tell me? Representative (A): After I and the other representatives arrived in Beijing, we visited Kong several</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>times and persuaded him to be mindful of the sufferings of our homeland. According to Kong, he naturally cannot disregard the close relationship between himself and his homeland. At the beginning of the incident, he did everything he could to eliminate the war in its early stages and to secure the peace of his homeland, but unfortunately, things did not go as planned, which is extremely distressing. Now, all sectors of the province and fellow villagers from various places abroad have either publicly elected representatives to come to Beijing to urge him, or jointly sent telegrams with great meaning. Under the sense of shame and gratitude, he should make an effort. However, he is currently in charge of the Ministry of Industry and has just begun to organize it, with a multitude of official duties that make it difficult to spare time. He is truly sorry. In the future, he will continue to support Shanxi with his love for his homeland and will assist from the sidelines to ensure its success, and will not disregard it because of his service to the central government. He also said that Shanxi is originally a poor province. After the Xinhai Revolution, the provincial defense forces were fortunately not numerous, so the finances were still self-sufficient and all undertakings could be developed calmly. Later, due to various environmental factors, the army increased, and the finances gradually fell into deficit. Since last year, mixed military personnel, their families, and bandits have risen up, and the financial difficulties have become increasingly serious, and unrest has been heard from time to time. For the current rectification, it is necessary to first reduce the army, preferably restoring it to the state before the second year of the Republic of China (1913), leaving only a small number of troops to defend the north and south of Shanxi. Even if it is not easy to do so for the time being, the army should be reduced to a level that is generally in line with the current financial situation to be effective. Because the people of Shanxi have always been loyal, and most of those who serve in the army do so out of compulsion, after the reduction, they can still be allowed to return to their fields and farm. Even those who are not from Shanxi should be settled in other productive enterprises. All the remaining military expenses should be used for construction expenses. In this way, turning useless manpower and resources into useful and continuous construction is the main way to implement the principle of people's livelihood. Secondly, as for various government expenses, in this time of financial disorder, since it is impossible to increase the burden on the people and there are no other ways to generate wealth, we can only temporarily tighten various redundant agencies, and use the savings to reorganize the finances. If we can maintain this for a year or two, we can restore the finances to their original state. Thirdly, the Taiyuan Arsenal is the largest military target. Now that national unification and peace have reappeared, there is no need for it to exist. It is best to destroy it to prevent the coveting of ambitious people. Or, if it is a pity to destroy it, it should be strictly restricted and supervised by the central government and the people of the province, and be transformed into agricultural tools or other equipment that is beneficial to the people. If we can do so, turning the useless into the useful, then Shanxi's future development is still promising. This is what Kong told me. After the conversation, the reporter took his leave and left.</p>
<h3>Marauding Soldiers Cause Trouble in Shanxi Province During the New Year</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Communication: Because post-disaster recovery has not yet been completed and the political situation has not yet been settled, although the industrial and commercial sectors in this year's Western New Year still proceed as usual, the decorations are indeed less colorful than last year. Because their leaders Xu Yongchang, Shang Zhen, and other important generals are stranded in Tianjin and have not returned, the New Year celebrations in the military and political circles are also less grand than in previous years. However, the decorations in the headquarters and provincial government are still not much different from previous years. As usual, all civil officials above the recommended rank and military officers above the major rank held a celebration ceremony in the headquarters auditorium. All military units and agencies had a five-day holiday starting from the 30th. Soldiers were still given one dollar each, as usual, to supplement their wine and food. In addition to hanging lanterns, decorating with colored streamers, hanging flags, and posting couplets, all military units and agencies also held the usual group worship ceremony. There is nothing else to report. Today (5th), the New Year holiday has ended, and all military units and agencies have resumed work. One of the most worrying things in Shanxi Province is the looting by marauding soldiers. In the past, it only occurred in various counties in southern Shanxi. Unexpectedly, recently, counties along the Yellow River and in northern Shanxi have also been gradually affected. Although the authorities are also very anxious about this matter and have tried to prevent and stop it, the number of looting cases in various places is still increasing every day and has not decreased as a result, causing panic among the people and making them more uneasy than before. In order to avoid danger, wealthy families in various counties in southern Shanxi have mostly moved to other places, while families with modest wealth have also tried to hide. Trade has been suspended, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in various counties in southern Shanxi. The provincial government believes that if this phenomenon is not prevented urgently, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, yesterday, it issued another telegram to the county magistrates of various counties, instructing them to take strict precautions and not be negligent. When Xu Yongchang was in Bingzhou, he also telegraphed the garrisons and county magistrates of various counties, ordering them to pay attention to these deserters and marauding soldiers at all times. Once discovered, they should be arrested and executed on the spot to deter bandits. However, it is still unknown whether the counties have complied with the order. In Mi Yu Town, the second district of Jingle County in northern Shanxi, more than 30 marauding soldiers suddenly appeared a few days ago, fully armed. When their demand for supplies was not met, they began to loot. Residents fled in droves. Two shopkeepers of a certain grocery store, who were old and weak and unable to escape, were captured by the bandits and ordered to hand over their money. When the two shopkeepers did not answer, the bandits used kerosene to burn their kidney area and branded their faces with hot irons. They still did not hand over the money, so the bandits left after whistling. It is estimated that more than a dozen shops, a tax collection office, and various households in the town were looted. Many women who did not have time to hide were raped. The losses in the town were quite significant. Furthermore, in Gaoping County in southern Shanxi, looting cases have been occurring continuously since the withdrawal of the various armies. Recently, 30 looting cases have occurred in the past three days. The home of Jin Yuhua, a famous Kunqu actress residing in the county, who is well-known in Shangdang and has accumulated a lot of wealth, was also broken into by four deserters wearing gray uniforms and armed with weapons. They robbed her of 750 yuan in Tianjin banknotes, 10 yuan in Shanxi banknotes, two gold rings, fourteen silver dollars, and clothing items, totaling more than 1,000 yuan. In addition, the Rentai Chang grocery store and the home of wealthy businessman Li Tianshi were also looted that night, with significant losses. The other robbery cases are still increasing daily. Liu Yueting's division of Sun Dianying's army is stationed in the county, and all of its troops have arrived, totaling 9,231 officers and soldiers and 1,552 horses. The local area must supply their flour and fodder, which is very expensive, costing about 80,000 yuan per month. The people of the county cannot afford to supply the huge amount and have requested the authorities to reduce the burden. It is now learned that the supplies needed by Liu's army have been issued funds by the Second Logistics Station, ordering them to purchase them themselves. (January 5th)</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong Passes Through Xuzhou to Tongguan</h3>
<p>Chen Jicheng Accompanies Him to Huayin</p>
<p>Xuzhou Communication: Gu Zhutong, director of the Northwest Garrison Headquarters, returned to Beijing by plane from Tongguan before the New Year to see Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. Yesterday, the 9th, Gu and Chen Jicheng, commander of the Third Division, took the Pingpu train north from Beijing. On the morning of the 10th, they arrived in Xuzhou. Han Deqin, commander of the 52nd Division, welcomed them at the station. They went together to Han's private residence on Fushou Street to rest. This reporter visited Gu and Chen in the afternoon. Gu said that he was going to Tongguan because the Garrison Headquarters was still located in Tongguan and had not yet advanced to the west. Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Xia all have been pacified in general. Yang Hucheng is in charge of the government in Shaanxi, and his troops are stationed in Xi'an and various counties. Ma Hongbin will soon arrive in Gansu to take charge of the provincial government. Ma's troops are stationed in Ningxia and defend Gansu Province. All the northwest armies completely and sincerely obey the central government. The remnants of Feng's army, such as the troops of Jing Yuexiu, are in southern Shanxi and are being reorganized by Deputy Commander Zhang. The only thing left for post-disaster recovery in the northwest is disaster relief. The central government has allocated a sum of money for temporary disaster relief in Shaanxi. Due to economic reasons, Gansu Province has not been able to allocate funds for disaster relief. He himself will first go to Tongguan to handle post-disaster recovery in the northwest. Commander-in-Chief Chiang will either inspect the northwest after the central government's affairs have been completed. Chen said that the 2nd, 3rd, and 10th divisions that the central government transferred to the northwest have now completed their reduction and reorganization. The 2nd Division is stationed around Tongguan, the 3rd Division is stationed in Huayin and Huaxian, and the 10th Division is stationed in Lingbao and Shaanzhou, gradually opening up to the northwest. However, they have not yet received orders to enter Gansu. The original armies in the northwest have been reorganized by order of the central government. In the future, the Garrison Headquarters may send personnel to check them. His own Third Division includes the two brigades of Li Yutang and Li Xianzhou. Li Sisuo has been reassigned as deputy division commander of the First Division. Currently, the division has sent Deputy Adjutant Zhou Xuan to Xi'an to run the Cultural Daily, which is under the jurisdiction of the Garrison Headquarters, to develop northwest culture. Northwest transportation urgently needs to be developed. That evening, Gu and Chen took the Longhai train west, heading to Tongguan and Huayin, respectively. (10th)</p>
<h3>He Jian Requests Prior Reorganization and Dismissal of the Fourth Route Army</h3>
<p>Chiang's Reply Telegram Does Not Approve</p>
<p>Changsha Communication: He Jian, commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army, originally commanded the 15th, 16th, and 19th divisions. After the second recovery of Changsha, he added the 31st and 32nd divisions, totaling five divisions. Commander-in-Chief Chiang recently appointed Wang Jinyu as the bandit suppression supervisor of the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi border areas, and Xu Yuanquan as the bandit suppression supervisor of the Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan border areas. The troops under the jurisdiction of the Fourth Route Army, such as Wang Dongyuan's 15th Division, have entered Tongxiu, Jiangxi from Pingjiang. Tao Guang's 31st Division has entered Tongcheng, Hubei from Pingjiang, and then turned to Xiushui, Jiangxi. Chen Guangzhong's 32nd Division has entered Wanzai, Jiangxi from Liuyang. In fact, they are all within the area under Wang Jinyu's command. Li Jue's 19th Division has been in Gongan and Songzi, Hubei from Liling. In fact, it is within the area under Xu Yuanquan's command. Therefore, He Jian believed that since bandit suppression work has established border area supervisors and divided areas for suppression, and all units of the Fourth Route Army to suppress the rebellion have also been assigned commanders, the title of commander-in-chief is unnecessary. He specially telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Director He, requesting that an order be issued to abolish it, and that all troops be handed over to the two supervisors Wang and Xu to command bandit suppression. At the same time, he also sent Song Heceng, director of the Department of Construction, and Yu Kedong, a special representative of the headquarters stationed in Hunan, to Beijing to present everything to Chairman Chiang, but the reply telegram was received and was not approved. The text of the telegram is as follows: He Jian telegraphed: "Since the end of the campaign to suppress the rebels, Your Excellency has mobilized a large army to suppress the communists. Wherever your virtue has reached, good news has been frequently reported. Recently, the establishment of border area supervisors and the division of areas for suppression have been successful, and you are particularly admirable. The various troops of the subordinate Route Army will immediately transfer to the command of the two supervisors Wang and Xu and strive to complete their missions. I am relieved, but I have been ordered to command the affairs of the Fourth Route Army for two years, and I am ashamed to have not achieved an inch of merit. I am always fearful of being in a deep abyss. I have previously requested to resign, but have not been approved. Now, fortunately, the rebellion has been eliminated, and the remaining bandits can be annihilated. It is proposed that an order be issued to abolish the title of commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army to be a prelude to reorganization and dismissal. In addition to the current progress of the various troops and the various situations of undertaking tasks in accordance with the order, I have specially entrusted Councilor Yu Kedong, Correspondent Zhou Wei, and Councilor Hu Haichun to present them on my behalf, and I have also requested Director Song Heceng to go to the Garrison Headquarters to see Director He. I respectfully telegraph this for your review and order to be followed." Commander-in-Chief Chiang replied by telegram: "The three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are currently in the midst of bandit suppression. The reduction and reorganization should be carried out after the bandit suppression has come to an end. I have already telegraphed Director He of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters to telegraph the various commander-in-chiefs, army commanders, and division commanders of the three provinces to comply with this order. Your request will not be discussed for the time being." He Chengjuan replied by telegram: "The reduction and reorganization of the army should be implemented, but Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are currently in the midst of bandit suppression. I have received a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief stating that the reduction and reorganization will be carried out after the bandit suppression has come to an end. As for the division of areas, although it has been determined by order of the Headquarters, the various troops of the Fourth Route Army are still under your command due to the actual situation. I have arranged for Yu Wanxing (Wang Jinyu), Ling Bing (Xia Douyin), Su (Liu Wendao), and Funan (Song Heceng) to come to Hunan by train. We will discuss the rest in person." (7th)</p>
<h3>The Unified Tax Bureau of Shandong and Henan Established in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Office Opens and Taxes Collected Starting on the 1st</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: The Ministry of Finance has issued a general order to all provinces and cities across the country that likin will be abolished starting on January 1st of this year. The various tax bureaus in Qingdao City have complied with the order and closed. The Ministry of Finance has sent personnel to establish the Unified Tax Bureau of Shandong and Henan, and has appointed Shen Yaorong as the director and Lu Xiaomie as the deputy director. Pan and Lu arrived in Qingdao a few days ago. The bureau is temporarily located at 37 Yangxin Road and began operations on January 1st, collecting various taxes. It is reported that the unified tax will include five items: cigarettes, wheat flour, cotton yarn, matches, and cement. Currently, only taxes on cigarettes and wheat flour are being collected. As for cotton yarn, matches, and cement, the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued collection methods, so it is not convenient to implement them at this time. The bureau has handled various matters properly and will begin to implement uniform taxation once the order from the Ministry arrives in Qingdao. (January 7th)</p>
<h3>Clearing of Communist Bandits in Huoqiu Completed</h3>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The Communist bandits of Hubei and Henan provinces once invaded Liu'an from Jinzhai last month but were jointly repelled by the defense army and local militia. They fled north through Mabao and gathered thousands more, attempting to seize Huoqiu. They first captured Baitafan, then successively occupied towns such as Kaishun Street and Yejiaji. The county seat of Huoqiu was in imminent danger. Ni Qihua, the magistrate of Huoqiu County, and various organizations and groups, seeing the momentum of the Communist bandits approaching the city walls, and the thin forces of the city's militia, which were difficult to resist, repeatedly telegraphed Wei Lihuang, the commander of the Anhui Northern Garrison in Bengbu, requesting that he quickly send capable troops to the rescue. Wei immediately dispatched Song Shike, commander of the Third Detachment, leading the First Regiment under Cheng Yi and the Second Regiment under Wang Shaoji, to proceed along the Zhengyang-Huoqiu line at the beginning of this month to suppress the bandits. Cheng's regiment advanced towards Yejiaji and engaged a small portion of the Communist bandits at Sunjiagang. They surrounded and suppressed them, killing more than ten on the spot and seizing twelve fast rifles and seventeen miscellaneous rifles. The Communist bandits in Baitafan were also routed by two battalions of Cheng's regiment, Wang and Hu. The bandits in Yejiaji fled back to Jinzhai upon hearing the news. Cheng's regiment continued to pursue and suppress them, while Song Shike led a portion of Wang's regiment to garrison at Lulimiao for defense and suppression. Now, the Communist bandits in Huoqiu have been completely cleared. (January 10)</p>
<h3>New Japanese Plan for Managing Yanbian</h3>
<p>Immigrating to Northern Korea</p>
<p>Expediting the Xiongxun Railway</p>
<p>Jilin Communication: According to a report from the Consulate in Seoul, Korea, to the Provincial Government of Heilongjiang, the Japanese Immigrant Company has been making unremitting efforts to promote immigration to Korea. Companies such as the Oriental Development Company and the Overseas Immigration Association plan to relocate a large number of Japanese people from the mainland to the Hamgyong North and South provinces of Korea, starting from the year 20 of the Republic (1931). According to their plan, the Tokyo Overseas Association will relocate 28 families to Shinan Township, Hamgyong North Province, next year, granting each family eight cho of reclaimed land (one cho is approximately 16 mu in China). The Oriental Development Company will transfer 65 families from Japan to Hamgyong North and South provinces next year, granting a total of more than 600 cho of reclaimed land. The Governor-General of Korea plans to establish an agricultural experiment station in Kapsan County, Hamgyong South Province, with a budget of 200,000 yuan next year, to reclaim fields around Mount Paektu and improve Korean agriculture. This is currently being planned by the Colonial Affairs Bureau. These immigration companies are nominally commercial organizations, but in essence, they are semi-official. The Japanese authorities' policy is simply to relocate Japanese people to Korea and drive Korean people to the Yanji area of China, acting as pioneers in implementing their policies. According to recent surveys, many Korean settlers in Yanji mortgage their real estate to the Japanese Oriental Development Company for loans, and about eight out of ten are unable to repay and have their property confiscated by the Japanese. Due to the lack of knowledge of the Korean people in Korea and the increasing number of Japanese coming to Korea in recent years, Koreans are often forced by livelihood to mortgage their land to the company as the only channel for financial accommodation. However, they do not know that if they fail to repay by the due date, the company will immediately confiscate their land and mortgage under the pretext of reorganization. Therefore, most of the Korean people who have fled to the Yanbian area of China have been oppressed by this immigration company. For example, the Korean riots that occurred in Tanchon County, Hamgyong South Province, last month, in which dozens of Korean farmers besieged a Japanese police station, were triggered by the immigration company forcibly confiscating their land and ordering them to leave, which aroused resentment among the Korean farmers. These so-called famine refugees, who have no foothold in Korea, come to the Yanbian area of China, where their livelihood is unstable. Moreover, due to various factors such as their status, their thoughts are abnormally excited. They are easily incited by others, blindly following and acting impulsively, and have been exploited. This year, there have been repeated cases of Korean communist bandits and riots. The root cause is that the number of Korean people who have fled to the Yanbian area of China is increasing year by year. In addition, the eastern section of the Tumen River Railway, from Unggi to Hunchun, was completely completed on December 1. Japanese officials and businessmen held a railway opening ceremony in Hunchun on that day. The Japanese began to build this line in the 17th year of the Republic (1928) and have only now completed it. Regarding the Jihui Railway issue, the Japanese, seeing the intense nationalist sentiment in China, are temporarily maintaining a wait-and-see attitude on the surface, but they have not abandoned their intention to achieve their goal. They are racking their brains to implement their plan. This Hunchun to Unggi line is also the base line for the future Jihui Railway. The Tumen River Railway can be divided into two parts: the eastern line and the western line. The eastern line, from Hoeryong to Sangsambong, is planned to be converted to a broad gauge so that it can directly reach Sangsambong from Chongjin, avoiding the hassle of changing trains. The western line, from Hunchun to Tonggwanzhen, is planned to begin construction next January. The Provincial Government believes that the influx of Korean墾 refugees into China not only increases the hidden dangers on the border but also develops transportation on the west coast of North Korea and connects with the atmosphere of Hunchun, which is of great importance to national defense and sovereignty. Therefore, it has issued a notice to all counties in Yanbian to investigate and take precautions as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Prepares to Implement Business Tax</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Convene a Business Tax Discussion Meeting</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province was the earliest to prepare for the abolition of likin, starting preparations in early 18th year of the Republic (1929), advocating the creation of a business tax to make up for the loss. The former Finance Department of Zhejiang Province established a Preparatory Committee for the Abolition of Likin to discuss and proceed. A method was agreed upon to start with commercial registration. The registration matters were entrusted to local chambers of commerce to handle on behalf. Later, due to the business community's concerns, no agreement was reached, and the matter was suspended. Now that likin has been abolished, the Provincial Government is determined to implement a business tax to supplement local revenue. However, since this is a new undertaking, the steps for implementation must be discussed in detail. Therefore, it has been decided to hold a meeting at the Finance Department on the 19th of this month to discuss the matter. The Provincial Government has already sent letters to leaders of various industries and economic experts, soliciting opinions on the creation of a business tax, to gather opinions from all parties and set a standard for implementation. The circular stated roughly: "Zhejiang Province is planning to create a business tax, and although a rough framework has been established, since this is a new undertaking, detailed discussion is necessary. The interests of businesses and the social economy should also be taken into account, so that implementation will be convenient in the future. Therefore, it is specifically scheduled to hold a business tax discussion meeting at the Finance Department at 2:00 PM on the 19th of this month. You are cordially invited to attend and provide guidance." It is said that the invited personnel include Ma Yinchu from Nanjing, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiji, and Xu Shusen from Shanghai, Wang Zhuzhai, Wang Xiangquan, Jin Shunquan, Zhu Mouxian, Han Zhirong, and Xu Qingfu from Hangzhou, as well as the chairmen of the chambers of commerce of Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and other places, totaling 34 people. The Finance Department will be represented by Wang Jiying, Wei Songtang, Xu Maolai, and Shen Ruji, totaling four people. It is also heard that the Provincial Government plans to implement the business tax jointly with officials and businesses, with a quota of 10 million yuan, and has already held preliminary consultations with Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zuyao, Jin Runquan, and Shen Weizhen.</p>

<p>A Police Officer Steals a Gun and Falsely Accuses Residents of Zhapunan Hougang</p>
<p>Mao Yongchang (from Zhejiang), a police officer of the County Police 第wv Squad stationed in Zhapu, stole a wooden-cased gun from the deputy squad leader and hid it elsewhere, intending to transport it elsewhere. The theft was discovered, and after a thorough investigation, the officer falsely accused the residents Gao Jinfа and Chen Juhua of buying the gun. The squad leader brought all the witnesses to the county government for interrogation, and the truth came to light. Gao Jinfа and Chen Juhua were exonerated, and the officer confessed to the location where he had hidden the gun, which was recovered.

<p>Investigation of Business Tax</p>
<p>The County Government Finance Bureau, upon receiving instructions from the province to prepare for the implementation of a business tax, established an office within the Finance Bureau. Now that the abolition of likin has been officially announced, the business tax should be actively pursued. The initial step is to investigate the capital and total business volume of merchants as a basis for taxation. The Finance Bureau has appointed Hou Kemu and Gu Yu to be responsible for the investigation, and they have printed and distributed declaration forms to various businesses for completion.</p>
<p>Reactions to Quarrying on Tianma Mountain</p>
<p>The case of Jiang Erchang and others illegally quarrying on Tianma Mountain in this county was previously reported to the authorities by more than 700 local residents, including Gu Shunhua, who requested a ban. Chairman Jiang immediately instructed the former Jiangsu Civil Affairs Director Ji to investigate and deal with the matter strictly. The Jiangsu Department of Agriculture and Mines also ordered the mining area to be sealed off last summer. Now that Jiang Erchang has passed away, his wife, Jin, and the stone merchant Cao Yunji, are still deceiving the authorities and continuing to quarry. The local farmers, including Gu Shunhua, have again submitted reasons to the relevant authorities and Chairman Jiang, requesting a permanent ban.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Telegram Requesting Maintenance of Public Security Funding</p>
<p>The provincial subsidy for public security funding in Wuxian County has been reduced by 3,000 yuan per month since January, according to a provincial order. The county government and local figures have repeatedly telegraphed the province requesting that the funding be maintained.

<p>Amnesty for Political Prisoners</p>
<p>The Higher Court Review Committee received an order from the Ministry of Justice on the 6th of this month, ordering that within seven days of receipt of the document, all political prisoners detained in prisons in various counties who meet the amnesty regulations should be organized to form a review committee to verify the facts, provide bail, and release them. After receiving the order, President Lin of the court immediately formed a review committee with Chief Prosecutor Wang Simo, Prosecutor Jin Henian, and Criminal Court President Lin Dawen. He also issued a notice to the wardens of various county prisons yesterday (the 12th), requiring them to report the list of political prisoners in custody within three days of receipt of the document to facilitate verification and release.</p>
<p>Higher Court Petitions the Ministry for Relief of Prisons</p>
<p>President Lin of the Higher Court stated that according to statistics, the prisons in Jiangsu Province are newly built and that the number of prisoners detained has reached more than 24,000, which is more than double the number in 1928. All prisons are overcrowded, making it difficult to add more prisoners. If relief measures are not taken, the lives of the prisoners in custody are in extreme danger. Therefore, yesterday (the 12th), he specifically petitioned the Ministry of Justice, requesting that relief measures be taken immediately.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Resignation of All Township Chiefs in the County</p>
<p>The township chiefs of Wuxi, including Qian Zongliang, recently submitted a joint resignation to the county government due to financial exhaustion and difficulty in handling affairs. The petition stated roughly that the matters ordered to be handled by the townships were increasing day by day, while the administrative and operational expenses of the townships were decreasing. The purpose of the township chiefs going to the province to receive training was to handle local affairs. Now that the funding situation is like this, the results are contrary to their wishes. Even if they want to work hard for the public, it is like trying to cook without rice. Exhausted both mentally and physically, it is difficult to maintain. In desperation, they have no choice but to jointly submit their resignations, requesting the appointment of other capable people to take over. It is not known what Director Pan of the County will decide.</p>
<p>Philanthropists Provide Relief to the Poor</p>
<p>Since the 10th of this month, Wuxi has been experiencing heavy snow and extremely cold weather. Some of the poor and prisoners in prison have already died from the cold. Ji Yunqing, a native of Wuxi in Shanghai, has initiated a winter relief effort, raising donations of clothing and rice in both Wuxi and Shanghai. He also plans to hold a three-day theatrical performance, with all the proceeds going to the relief effort. He has already advanced funds to purchase rice and will start distributing porridge immediately. He has also asked Du Yuesheng, a well-known figure in Shanghai, to donate a large number of cotton-padded clothes and quilts to be distributed to the prisoners in prison in Wuxi to help them keep warm. The Red Swastika Society has also advanced the distribution of rice tickets to help the poor.</p>
<p>Meat Industry Requests Suspension of Slaughter Tax</p>
<p>The Wuxi Meat Industry Association recently stated that since the government is implementing the abolition of likin and the introduction of a business tax, according to Article 7 of the Guidelines for the Preparation of a Business Tax by the Likin Abolition Committee of the Ministry of Finance, after the business tax is implemented, all existing license taxes, stamp taxes, slaughter taxes, and other taxes similar to the business tax in various provinces should be merged or abolished separately. The association is currently petitioning to change to a business tax. All previously donated slaughter taxes, construction special donations, and local taxes should be abolished, just like the abolished tax authorities. They have specially requested the county chamber of commerce to forward the petition to the Finance Department, requesting that all previously donated taxes be abolished from January 1st to comply with the central government's policy of one tax per item and to abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, thereby alleviating the burdens on businesses and maintaining business operations.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Director Zhu Leads Troops to Suppress Bandits in Shengxian</p>
<p>The bandits in Xinchang and Shengxian counties, Zhejiang Province, are mostly former subordinates of Zhou Fengqi. They occupy dangerous mountains and often harass the area, leaving the people unable to sleep peacefully. The Provincial Government, after deliberation, decided to send Zhu Mingtao, the director of the Security Department, to personally lead troops to suppress them severely, with a deadline of one month to clear them out. After receiving the order, Zhu led his staff officers and adjutants to Shengxian across the river from Hangzhou. The troops he took to Xinchang and Shengxian included the four companies directly under the Third Regiment of the Security Force and the Eighth and Ninth Companies of the Second Regiment, one machine gun company, one mortar platoon, and one special service company. All the self-defense forces and police in the counties of Xinchang, Shengxian, and Fengtai were under the command of Director Zhu during the bandit suppression period.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Telephone Will Be Managed by the Ministry</p>
<p>Since Zhejiang implemented austerity policies, merging agencies and laying off personnel to save expenses, there have been rumors that the Construction Department will transfer the Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Bureau to the Ministry of Communications of Zhejiang Province to avoid both parties wasting public funds and to avoid disputes. As for the difficulties of the merger, the first is that the Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Office has spent more than one million yuan. It is uncertain whether the Ministry can have this huge sum of money, or whether it will be allocated in installments. It is currently under negotiation.</p>

<p>Gao Tianmin Escorted to He Court</p>
<p>Gao Tianmin, a local resident, previously filed a complaint with the province against Shen Shihua, the county magistrate. The province then ordered the county government to detain Gao Tianmin first, pending the designation of a court by the High Court to hear the case. It is now learned that the High Court has designated the Jiaxing Local Branch Court to hear the case, so Gao Tianmin was taken away by the court on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Discovery of Stone Coffin and Phoebe Coffin During River Opening</p>
<p>In the Mojiagang area, about half a li behind the Shenjia Garden in Nanqiao Town, the original Baiqugang and other ports are being filled in due to the passage of the Nanmin Route. A new port is being opened to the east of the road to facilitate circulation, and the Construction Bureau has submitted a report to the province, hiring workers to fill and pick up from January 1 of this year. Yesterday, in the Shen family's farmland, at a depth of about ten feet, a stone coffin suddenly appeared. The lid was made of yellow sandstone slabs, and the construction was extremely solid. The area of each piece was two zhang long, one zhang five wide, and two chi thick. It took many workers to transport it, and the gray sandstone wall that was built around was blasted open before the tomb area was visible. There were a total of three tombs in front and behind. The first tomb had already decayed, leaving only dry bones of men and women, as well as several copper mirrors, candlesticks, and incense burners. The second tomb was filled with water, but the vermilion coffin was still intact as new, but only the outer coffin (commonly known as the coffin cover) was slightly moldy. It was immediately transported out and split open, and there was also black stagnant water inside the coffin. After draining it and checking, it was a female skeleton with a hair bun in the form of a snail shell and a ruyi inserted. (The ruyi was a flat wooden style without flowers.) Next to it were two wooden combs (made of bird bones, with fine and even teeth). In front of the feet was a bronze round mirror (the back of the mirror had patterns of wild beasts in the center circle, and there were bloodstains all over it), all of which were undamaged. In addition, there was a carefree bed at the bottom of the coffin, which was the right length and had the same style as a window lattice. A round hole was opened on it, which was just right for the head pillow, which is said to have been used for the original burial. The material of the coffin wood has been identified by experts as phoebe wood, which is why it has been able to last for so long without rotting. However, the age and surname cannot be determined because there are no mining records available. However, judging from the tomb method and the snail bun hairstyle, it is speculated that it must be a request from the Ming Dynasty. The Construction Bureau has made wooden boxes for the female bones and buried them in a public cemetery. There are still one coffin and three outer coffins, which will be opened when the weather is clear to find out the truth.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Civil Affairs Department Notice: Illegally Collected Reporting Fees</p>

The Civil Affairs Department has now ordered the county government to instruct the village chiefs and deputies of the villages concerned to be warned, and to order them to return the collected fees for writing the reporting forms in full.</p>
<p>Implementation of Special Tax Reform on Foil Categories</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Special Tax Bureau for Foil Categories has been ordered to be abolished and replaced with a business tax. The director, Zhao Xianglin, remains in office.

Now, the 44th meeting of the Provincial Executive Committee has resolved to approve the appointment of seven people, including Tang Liansheng, Wang Wenyi, Fu Bingnan, Qi Zhenlin, Ren Yanzhao, Lu Ziyan, and Sun Lie, as members of the Xiaoshan County Guali Town Business Organization Unification Committee, and has ordered the Xiaoshan County Executive Committee to notify them.</p>
<p>The Defense Corps Solves a Robbery Case</p>
<p>The family of Gao Guisheng, in front of the Qinglong Mountain in Xicang, Xiaoshan, was preparing a dowry for his sister's wedding when bandits broke into the house and robbed them, injuring the mother. The value of the items robbed was five or six hundred gold. He immediately reported to the local defense corps, which stepped up its investigation. Yesterday (the 5th), two suspected robbers, Gao Aben and Gao Ahao, were apprehended nearby. Six types of stolen goods, including cloth and clothing, were found. The victim identified them without error, and the robbers confessed to the crime. The stolen goods and the robbers were sent to the county government for legal action.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Local Finance Investigation Committee</p>
<p>The third Xiaoshan County Administrative Conference resolved to organize a County Finance Investigation Committee and nominate members, which was submitted to the county government for approval. It is now known that County Magistrate Du Shihua convened a meeting of various committees on January 7 to discuss the regulations of the Investigation Committee and nominated Gui Zhanglin as a standing committee member. The committee will be temporarily located in the relief home and will be established immediately.</p>
<p>Telegraph Request to Stop Illegal Collection of Rice Donations</p>
<p>The Preparatory Office of the Dayi Township Office in the Fifth District of Xiaoshan County illegally collected four sheng of rice per mu from the tenant farmers in the township as a mu donation. The Fifth District Office secretly assisted in this, acting in collusion. Farmers such as Wang reported this to the Second District Executive Committee, and after investigation, it was found to be true. Telegraphs were sent to the county party headquarters and the county government, ordering them to strictly stop it and investigate the matter according to law.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Robbery of Four Families and Injury of a Pedestrian</p>
<p>The Linhai Youheng Grocery Store in Xiejiabao, Dongxiang, was robbed around 10 p.m. on the 6th by more than 20 bandits armed with wooden-cased guns. They broke through the back door and entered, first grabbing a shop apprentice and beating him severely. They took over 180 small silver dollars from the silver chest. They then broke into the bedroom of the shop owner, Wei Fusheng. Wei had gone to the countryside to collect debts three days ago and had not returned. Wei's wife, seeing the situation was not good, voluntarily opened the chest and gave the bandits 160 silver dollars. The bandits then broke into the neighboring Taihetang Pharmacy, followed by the Xushengtai Rice Store and a certain cigarette paper store to loot. The three stores had been warned in advance and were only able to have their account boxes destroyed and some loose silver dollars stolen. When the bandits left the Dayouheng store, they encountered a water worker on the way who shouted loudly. He was shot with a gun, and the bullet went through his right wrist, causing him to fall to the ground. Soon, the sound of gongs and drums rang loudly in the street, and the bandits fled towards Yuyao.</p>

<h3>The Re-establishment of the Hangzhou Jisheng Midwifery School</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Private Jisheng Midwifery School, originally named Jisheng Obstetrics School, was founded by Principal Wu Chenyi. Since its establishment in the 14th year of the Republic, it has been painstakingly managed by Ms. Wu for six years. Ms. Wu is enthusiastic about education and has strong perseverance. The school's directors, Wang Zhubao, Zhu Xingwu, Wang Bihua, Wang Huafen, Zhang Xingfu, Tan Xihong, Fan Xiaowen, Wu Huikui, Zhang Xinpei, Zhang Xuren, and Wu Jianfei, have worked hard to maintain it. Their efforts are commendable. The school's board of directors submitted a request to the Hangzhou Municipal Government in July last autumn to be registered with the Education Department, intending to go through the school registration procedures. Unfortunately, Principal Wu fell ill and passed away in August of that year. The board of directors, seeing that there was no one to continue the work, immediately reported to the government to suspend the school. All students enrolled in the school were given transfer certificates to take exams elsewhere to continue their studies. However, the students of the school faced various inconveniences in transferring to other schools, and they missed the fine example of former Principal Wu. During the winter vacation, they united with their classmates to start a movement to restore the school so that they could complete their studies. They publicly elected Ms. Zhang Yuye and Ms. Zheng Hengbai to come to Hangzhou to earnestly request the former Dean of Education, Ruan Qiyu, to take the position of principal, and invited Yu Xiongfei to serve as vice principal. Former Director of Obstetrics, Liang Fangnu, took the position of Dean of Education. They worked hard to raise funds to restore the alma mater. Currently, they have borrowed Ruan's residence at No. 41 Gang'er Lane, Hangzhou City, as the school site. They have already published a notice declaring the re-establishment of the school. In addition to the unanimous return of old students, they have also published a notice to recruit new students, and the number of applicants is very enthusiastic. Recently, the new and old directors of the school publicly elected Director Gu Tianxi to pay a visit to the Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, Fan Qi, to personally report on the school's previous operations and the progress of this re-establishment movement.</p>

<h3>Soochow University Holds Commemorative Week</h3>
<p>Submits a Plan to the Ministry of Education to Resolve the Turmoil</p>
<p>The School Motto is Changed to "Investigate Knowledge, Sincerity, and Correctness"</p>
<p>Soochow University opened on January 11 this year. The 12th was Monday. The General Manager's Commemorative Week was held at 10 a.m. All faculty, staff, and students attended. President Zhang Shouyong presided over the meeting and reported six items of school affairs and solutions. The situation approved by the Ministry of Education by telegram was also reported, and the school motto was changed to "Investigate Knowledge, Sincerity, and Correctness." The key points of the speech were that the former General Manager publicly declared on January 12 of the eighth year of the Republic, supporting the Republic of China. Today's Commemorative Week happens to be this day, so the four words "Investigate Knowledge, Sincerity, and Correctness" are the basic ideals for supporting Soochow University. In the past, the former General Manager asked Yangming to unite knowledge and action, so he encouraged people to manage, and his sincerity was good. Our school encourages students with this, which is also what the former General Manager called painstaking. Now that we have obtained the unique treasure in the knowledge of the political philosophy of the former General Manager, the four words "Investigate Knowledge, Sincerity, and Correctness" in the university are to promote a person from the inside to the outside, starting from the inside of a person and pushing it to peace in the world. This kind of spiritual development theory and should be based on the scope of the former General Manager's revelation. Soochow University takes this as the school motto, and takes the words of Zeng Zi's preaching, which is more profound than the previous theory of Yangming's learning. Students who come here to study should think from the big source and the big principle. If they can do these four words, there will never be any emotional events again. The former General Manager said in his speech at the Whampoa Military Academy that everyone wants to make trouble, but it is nothing more than saying that the teacher's management is not good and infringes on the students' equality and freedom. The former General Manager does not allow students to be free at all, because students are equal to officials and soldiers. Since I am the head of a school, I am like the commander-in-chief of the army. Soochow University has more than a thousand students. If there is no discipline, how can they be commanded? Therefore, when it is necessary to expel students, I cry bitterly, but I can only implement it. Soochow University's classmates are all kind and preserve the pure and good academic style, which is especially important. The things of the past are like yesterday's death. The former General Manager told people to be loving, sincere, and genuine. My classmates should especially use this to make friends and deal with the world. As for the teacher's thinking, under the rule of the party, the principle should be not to violate the party's principles. As for the future, when the period of political tutelage advances to the period of constitutional government, there will naturally be a fundamental law. Scholars who discuss politics should base themselves on the political system under which they are in. As for comparative theories, they can be developed themselves, but if they conflict, it is not allowed. This is also my deep hope that teachers and students will unify their thinking and encourage each other. The telegram from Soochow University to the Ministry of Education and the reply from the Ministry of Education are recorded below. (1) The text sent to the Ministry of Education said: "The Ministry of Education of the Capital is hereby informed that the situation of the Soochow University's turmoil has been reported. The solutions are summarized and telegraphed: (1) The school motto is changed to 'Investigate Knowledge, Sincerity, and Correctness.' (2) The commemorative week used to be inconsistent with the ceremony, but now it is held every week in accordance with the regulations. (3) Vice President Liao has absolutely nothing to do with the old cases in the Southeast. Vice President Yang of the Graduate School can prove it. Now that Vice President Liao has repeatedly requested to resign, it has been submitted to the board of directors, and it is planned to ask him to specialize in middle school. (4) The teacher's thinking should be more rectified. (5) The academic style should be more strict. (6) Once a student has been expelled, he is not allowed to apply for reinstatement. The school will give a certificate of study based on the seriousness of the circumstances, so that he can transfer to another school. The opening date of the 11th is very near. Please give instructions by telegram, so that we can do our best." Zhang Shouyong, President of Soochow University, sealed. (2) The Ministry of Education replied by telegram: "President Zhang of Soochow University: I have received all the telegrams. The Central Secretariat has approved this case and handed it over for review, and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has reported it. The Ministry is reviewing it. According to the six solutions submitted by telegram, the proposed solutions are generally in line with the requirements and should be approved. However, Luo Jiji, a teacher of the school, has made absurd remarks and repeatedly publicly slandered our party. It is not appropriate to allow him to continue to hold office. The school should immediately replace him. In the future, the school principal should also supervise the faculty, staff, and students to study the party's principles and unify their thinking in order to cultivate a pure and long-lasting academic style. The whole school students must be strictly warned not to take any more irregular actions. This is of utmost importance. You should follow the instructions and report the compliance situation." Ministry of Education, Jia.</p>
<h3>County Education Bureau</h3>
<p>Requests Thorough Investigation of Fake School Records</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau yesterday submitted a document to the county government saying: "In the case of Qin Junfu's instruction No. 1155, it is stated that: In order to comply with the matter, a public letter from the Anhui Provincial Department of Education states: According to the principal of the Provincial Second Secondary Vocational School, Quan Zhenjun, in the student roster for the first semester of the 19th year, Zhang Zhenqiu, a student in the second grade of the science department, claims to have studied at the Shanghai County Second Middle School. Whether this is true, etc., a certificate is issued. Upon investigation, it was found that there is no County Second Middle School in this county, and there is no principal Fang Xinzhi. Upon investigation, in October of last year, an order was received from your office to investigate the academic qualifications of student Shi Chuanhe, and the school name and principal opened were the same as what Zhang Zhenqiu claimed. It is obvious that someone privately tore up a false seal and fabricated a certificate to falsely impersonate a student. This is illegal. In view of the previous reasons, it is appropriate to investigate the case and report it. I hope that you will review it and forward it to the Anhui Provincial Department of Education for a thorough investigation to rectify the academic atmosphere."</p>
<h3>Central Political School</h3>
<p>The Xikang Class Delegation Arrives in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Visits Factories and Scenery in Wuxi for Several Days</p>
<p>Provincial Mass Education Academy Holds a Welcome Party</p>
<p>The special training for Xikang students attached to the Central Political School has completed various training courses in order. In accordance with the original plan of the central government, they will start to visit the capital and other places, so that the students can understand the real situation in the mainland of the country as a preparation for implementing party governance and construction in Xikang, and to connect the feelings of the He and Tibetan nationalities and eliminate the past isolation between each other. After several preparations, on the previous (6th) day, the class affairs officer Lu Shunong and the captain Jiang Jiaji led the team to leave Beijing, and arrived in Wuxi that evening, staying at the Provincial Mass Education Academy. They visited major factories in the area for several days, and were warmly received by all factories. They also visited scenic spots, such as Huiquan Mountain, Yuantouzhu, and Meiyuan. The students were all very happy. It was originally scheduled to leave Ximi and Shanghai on the 9th, but due to the heavy wind and snow, the work in Xixi could not be completed as scheduled, so it was changed to arrive in Shanghai today (12th).</p>
<p>It is also known that after the delegation arrived at the Provincial Mass Education Academy, although it was during the winter vacation, the students staying in the academy still actively prepared a welcome party. When the delegation stopped going out for visits, they formally opened the meeting in the auditorium of the academy at 2 p.m. that afternoon to welcome them. After Chairman Ni Xikun reported the purpose of the meeting, the class affairs officer thanked the entire delegation on behalf of the delegation, and invited Professor Chuan Baochen of the academy to give a lecture on the theory and practice of mass education. Then, Lin Zhonghua and Wang Xifeng, students of the delegation, talked about the political, economic, and social situation of Xikang. They also gave a detailed explanation of the Exotic Journey to the West published in the Times. Finally, the students of the academy performed entertainment, such as the harmonica team's performance of the Phantom Guards Peking Opera Visiting Relatives and Scolding Each Other to add to the fun. Finally, the students of the delegation participated in the performance of the Kangzhuang Song and Dance. The singing was melodious and the steps were neat, which was very interesting. The audience was beaming and said they had never seen anything like it. It is also known that the country will stay in the junior high school department of Shanghai Middle School in Ximen after arriving in Shanghai, and will have to return to Beijing in about five or six days.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the White Goose Painting Research Institute</h3>
<p>The White Goose Painting Research Institute, a well-known cultural group, has become more and more consolidated since it was registered by the Municipal Education Bureau. Chen Qiucao and Fang Xuegu, the directors of the institute, are actively preparing for the improvement of various affairs of the institute, sparing no effort. Recently, because the original location faced north and the light was not good, and the research room was not well distributed, in order to expand the scope, a four-story building was rented on Changchun Road. In addition to adding painting rooms, it is planned to add many dormitories for research members. The library and reading rooms should be well-equipped, and the outdoor space is wide and beautiful with flowers and trees. The researchers can take a break after class, which is very convenient. It is currently being decorated and will be opened at the same time as the fifth practice exhibition being prepared by the institute.</p>

<p>Result: 29 to 20, winning against Xia Guang</p>
<p>Second final: Friday evening at 8 p.m. The first final between the champions of Group B1 and B2 of the West Qing Basketball Association was held at 8 p.m. last night.

The second final between the two teams will be held at 8 p.m. this Friday. It is difficult to tell who will win the championship at this moment.</p>
<h3>Galloping Steed Overcomes Strong Enemy</h3>
<p>Amidst the silver flute sound, Qian Jingyong of Shanghai Zhong cut in from behind, his foot on the line. Although he scored, it was invalid. Fortunately, luck was still on his side, and he made two free throws, breaking the record first. Kang Yuefa of Xia Guang invaded from the side and scored, returning the score to 2-2. Qian Jiexing, the pillar of Xia Guang, commanded the three armies. When the opportunity came, Kang scored again. After several exchanges, Chen Guangqiu and Kang Yuefa, the galloping steeds of Xia Guang, broke through the gate and each scored a goal. Xia Guang immediately took the lead with 8 to 2. Shanghai Jiang rested and planned, hoping to recover. However, they were too eager to achieve success and wasted many opportunities. Unexpectedly, Ren Jiexing scored another point with a free throw, and the score gradually narrowed. Qian of Shanghai Jiang scored a point with a free throw, and their morale was slightly boosted. Wang Gongying boosted his energy and advanced bravely, winning a goal. The score between the two teams became 9 to 5 (Xia Guang leading). Shanghai Zhong defended the key points, as solid as a golden city. Xia Guang had no way to get in and could only shoot from a distance. Fortunately, Ren Jiexing scored one out of one free throw, creating an advantage of 12 to 5. Shanghai Zhong made many throws, but they were distracted and the ball was not accurate. After a long time, Feng Nianhua finally scored a goal. Xia Guang also stopped the troops and rested due to the unfavorable situation. Afterwards, the ball situation was equal, and Ren and Qian each scored a goal. In the first half, Xia Guang led with 14 to 9.</p>
<h3>Heroes Create the Times</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Shanghai Zhong bravely fought back, with terrifying shouts. Feng Nianhua shot from the side and scored first. Wang Gongying raised his hand and the ball went into the basket. Qian Jingyong lurked deep under the basket, and a ball came from afar, which he turned around and threw in. With three goals, Shanghai Zhong finally rose to the occasion and took the lead with 15 to 14. Xia Guang then reorganized its line and fought again. However, Qian Jingyong revisited the old place and found the basket again, making the difference 17 to 14. When Kang Yuefa of Xia Guang was hoarse, he ventured alone and shot a goal. The two teams were one point apart. Qian Jingyong added three goals in a row, and the atmosphere suddenly became strong. The old and young of Shanghai Zhong accompanied the cheers, starting from all sides, as a pre-celebration for the successful efforts of these young heroes. Xia Guang did not give up and continued to fight. Kang Yuefa fought alone, grabbing two balls and making two free throws, suddenly making the score 23 to 22. The air was tense and the situation was serious. Feng Nianhua lived up to his mission and scored three goals in a row. As a result, Shanghai Zhong finally won 29 to 22.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Retains Commander Xiong</h3>
<p>Still to serve as Songhu Garrison Commander</p>
<p>Hu Zuyu Promoted to Commander of the Fifth Division</p>
<p>Since being injured in an airplane accident, Xiong Shihui, the Songhu Garrison Commander, has repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government, requesting to resign from his concurrent positions as Garrison Commander and Commander of the Fifth Division. During the New Year holiday, when Chairman Chiang came to Shanghai, Xiong earnestly resigned in person. After repeated persuasion by Chiang, he was retained on the grounds that the Songhu area was peaceful and there was no need to send someone to replace him. However, the position of Commander of the Fifth Division was promised to be assigned to someone else immediately. Yesterday, the Garrison Headquarters received an order from the General Headquarters, officially appointing Hu Zuyu, the Brigade Commander of the Fifth Division, as the Division Commander. As for the Garrison Commander, Xiong will continue to serve. It is heard that in the future, after Xiong recovers from his injury and is discharged from the hospital, he is scheduled to be promoted to Vice Minister of the Army Ministry.</p>

<h3>Origin of the Local Cold Wave</h3>
<p>Caused by an Anticyclone Originating in Siberia</p>
<p>Comparison of Temperature Records from the Observatory Over the Years</p>
<p>Truly an Unprecedented Cold Wave in 38 Years</p>
<p>According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the severity of the cold in the past few days has been rare in decades. According to the observatory's temperature records over the years, only the lowest temperature on January 19, 1893, dropped to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 1.1 degrees lower than last Friday's 11.1 degrees. In addition, although there were also extremely cold months in 1878, 1916, and 1917, they still did not reach the cold of this time. On January 4 of this year, the lowest temperature was still 53.1 degrees and the highest was 63.5 degrees. Afterwards, the temperature gradually decreased. On January 8, the lowest was 40.1 degrees and the highest was 42.8 degrees. The next day, the weather suddenly changed, with wind and clouds interacting. At 5 a.m., it was still 36 degrees, but at 9 p.m., it dropped to 26.8 degrees. On January 10, the highest was only 19.9 degrees and the lowest was 11.1 degrees. The difference between the two days was nearly 30 degrees. On the 11th and 12th, the weather was slightly milder, but the temperature remained below freezing. Even yesterday's highest temperature was only 30.4 degrees. The formation of this cold wave was due to an anticyclone in Siberia. Irkutsk, located near Lake Baikal, has always been the place with the highest air pressure in the world. This time, it reached 806 millimeters (normal air pressure is about 760 millimeters, which is the pressure of a 760-millimeter mercury column in a vacuum tube). As a result, the cold air moved south and spread over northern and central China, causing a rare blizzard. The seasonal winds that should have been present in the coastal areas during the winter retreated three times, leaving the area south of the Yangtze River estuary, becoming an unprecedented cold wave in 38 years. The cold wave in 1893 was also caused by the same anticyclone. At that time, the air pressure in Irkutsk was even higher than this year by one millimeter, so the temperature in Shanghai was also one degree lower. The cold lasted for a week before it began to recover. This cold wave is expected to last for the same period.</p>
<h3>Wind and Snow Hinder Shipping</h3>
<p>Baihe River Completely Frozen | Qingdao Port Closed</p>
<p>Xin Chang Breaks Through | Shangjiang Suspends Navigation</p>
<p>Due to the extraordinarily cold weather in recent days, land and water transportation in Shanghai have been hindered, and the shipping industry has suffered even greater losses. In the Beiyang region, the rivers are frozen, and shipping is impossible, which is rare in the past ten years. The information we have is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Frozen Ships. On the 10th of this month, the first day of severe cold in Shanghai, inland river and ocean-going ships were affected, and the impact on Beiyang liners was even greater. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from Tianjin, which stated that the waterways within Tanggu Port had been completely frozen overnight due to the storm and heavy snow on the night of the 10th. The ice thickness was more than ten feet. The lowest temperature was 14 degrees below zero. A total of twenty-one merchant ships anchored within the Baihe River, preparing to sail to Shanghai and other places on the 11th and 12th, were all blocked by the ice and unable to move. Not only were the engines of the ships ineffective, but even the icebreakers prepared by British and Japanese shipping companies could not break the solid ice. The ships were in a dilemma. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Feng ship was fortunate to have sailed out the day before and was not blocked. From yesterday onwards, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Beiyang ships have stopped sailing to Tianjin. That is, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin, and Dalian ships also only go to Tanggu Port.</p>
<p>Ice Breaks Qingdao. The inner harbor of Qingdao has never been frozen. This time, due to the severe cold, the port has also frozen. Since the morning of the 11th, the inner harbor of Qingdao suddenly formed solid ice seven or eight feet thick, and horses and carts could pass on the ice. This is the first time in more than ten years. Yesterday, various shipping companies received a telegram from Qingdao, instructing ships going to Qingdao to reduce cargo and ordering ships to anchor only on the sea outside the port. All passengers and cargo going to Qingdao from Shanghai were transferred to the sea by lighters and then transferred by land.</p>
<p>Broken Ship. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Chang ship, on its return voyage from Hong Kong and Guangzhou, encountered a storm on the 10th while traveling in the Min Sea. The ship had recently been repaired and was very strong. On that day, the ship encountered a hurricane on the sea outside Fuzhou Port. The waves were so huge that they had never been seen before. The ship was hit by huge waves and almost could not sail. Just as it was about to drop anchor to a safe place to avoid the wind, a huge wave suddenly came, as if with the force of ten thousand jun, and hit the bow of the ship violently. With a loud noise, a large hole was broken in the outer hull of the Xin Chang ship, and seawater rushed into the ship. The passengers on board were shocked. Fortunately, the damage was in the head, and the hull did not sink. The loss of the goods loaded in the cabin was still small. Later, the shipowner ordered the sailors to pump water while facing the waves. They have now arrived in Shanghai. The cargo will be unloaded first, and then the damage will be inspected and the ship will be put into dock for major repairs. Navigation Suspended. The water level of the Yangtze River should have decreased in winter. Since the 10th of this month, there has been wind and snow in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the cold has increased greatly. The water level in the Yichang and Shajin areas has suddenly dropped sharply. The lowest point is only about six feet. More than a dozen temporary cargo ships traveling on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River from Shanghai have been ordered by the respective shipping companies to suspend services and return to Shanghai to wait for the river water to rise again and the weather to warm up before resuming services.</p>
<h3>Silk Cocoon Industry Proposes New Tax Standards</h3>
<p>Huang Jin Chen and Others Telegraph the National Government</p>
<p>Huang Jin Chen and others, the chairman of the General Silk Cocoon Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying: "To the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance: The people have long yearned for the abolition of lijin [internal customs tax], and now it has been resolutely implemented. All industries and businesses are rejoicing. We have read the multiple circular telegrams from the Ministry, implementing the abolition of lijin and all taxes similar to lijin. After the abolition of lijin, new taxes will be implemented, striving to conform to economic principles, one item one tax, and not hindering the development of industry and commerce. Considering this grand event, it not only eliminates the malpractice of more than eighty years, but also creates an unprecedented grand track since the tax system of the Han and Tang dynasties, benefiting the people's livelihood without limit. We believe that silk is a major export commodity, suffering from domestic and foreign taxes for a long time. From now on, we can hope to reduce the burden and strive for the evolution of work, in order to seek the development of the silk industry. Regarding the revision of new taxes and the adoption of standards, we would like to present our humble opinions to the Ministry: (1) Silk and cocoons should be combined into one tax. Cocoons are the raw materials for raw silk, and silk and cocoons are essentially the same item. They should not be taxed separately. If a special tax on cocoons is levied after the abolition of lijin, then the export silk tax should be exempted. If the silk tax is still levied, then the entire cocoon tax should be refunded in full, in order to conform to the principle of one item one tax. (2) The cocoon tax standard should be adopted in moderation and should not be proportional to the current tax rate. Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, the evolution of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang cocoon donation has been the shortest at five yuan per dan and the longest at the current tax of twelve yuan. The reason for this is that the old warlords repeatedly increased it. Not only were local petty expenses, but even military expenses had to be exceptionally borne by silk cocoon merchants, with the original amount being increased by one-third and the additional amount accumulating to more than 50%. This does not conform to the principles of tax law. If a special tax on cocoons is levied after the abolition of lijin, the standard should be six yuan per dan for the cocoon donation levied during the time when the late Prime Minister served as the Provisional President in the first year of the Republic of China, which is the most moderate. All local harsh and miscellaneous additions should be abolished together. We have heard that various countries in the East and West generally exempt industrial and commercial raw materials from taxes within the country, and the tax rate on export goods is even lighter. Today, the export of raw silk to Europe faces fierce competition from Japanese silk, and prices have recently been reduced to suppress Chinese silk. The near stagnation of sales since last year is all due to crowding out. If a moderate regulation on cocoon tax can be made and the miscellaneous taxes can be deleted, and the export silk tax can be abolished, the burden will be low and the cost will be light, so that industrial and commercial enterprises will have the opportunity to strive, and the production of silk cocoons will have the hope of development. We sincerely request the Ministry to adopt our humble suggestions, review and implement them for the benefit of all. Huang Jinshen and others, the chairmen of the General Silk Cocoon Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, kowtow and steam."</p>
<h3>Current Status of Tax Bureau Collection</h3>
<p>Sending Staff to Be Stationed at Various Factories for Collection</p>
<p>Daily Revenue of Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, since the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance started collecting taxes on new vehicles according to the new regulations of the Ministry of Finance on January 1 of this year, the results have been very good. Yesterday, a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency visited Section Chief Wang of the bureau and inquired about the current status of collection. According to Section Chief Wang, only the two unified taxes on cigarettes and flour are currently being collected. The collection method for these tax regulations is to have the Tax Bureau send a number of resident factory committee members to be stationed at various cigarette or flour factories to supervise the collection, which can eliminate the malpractices of tax evasion and leakage. All factories, regardless of size, have committee members stationed there to accurately investigate the amount of daily output and record it in books using an accounting method. The factories then submit the records to the Tax Bureau every ten days or every half month. This method is based on the previous unified tax on cigarettes and is quite convenient and effective. As for whether it will be changed in the future, it is not yet known. As for the three unified taxes on matches, cement, and cotton yarn, they are currently under review by the Legislative Yuan. Once passed, collection can also begin. He also said that when the unified tax was first being prepared, there were some merchants who did not understand the content and sent letters or inquiries requesting a reduction in taxes. Now there are no such letters. It should be known that the collection of the unified tax is only once. After one collection, it can be passed domestically without obstruction. This was probably because they did not understand the actual situation at the time. The reporter then asked whether the five types of unified taxes currently stipulated by the Tax Bureau, namely cigarettes, flour, matches, cement, and cotton yarn, would be increased in the future. Section Chief Wang said that he had not heard of this matter and it seemed that there was no news of increasing other types of unified taxes for the time being. The reporter then met with Section Chief Zhong Jiu of the Third Section of the bureau and inquired about the daily statistics of the unified tax collected since New Year's Day. According to Section Chief Zhong, this matter is difficult to statistically analyze because each factory submits the records in an accounting format. However, based on the current situation, the daily revenue is approximately 50,000 to 60,000 yuan in Shanghai alone.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Refutes the "North-China Daily News" Editorial</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Can Hardly Shirk Responsibility for the Rampant Kidnappings</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association, due to the frequent kidnapping cases within the Settlement, sent a letter to the Municipal Council questioning its ability to maintain public order. The "North-China Daily News" published an editorial entitled "Forgetfulness" on December 29th of last year, attempting a defense. It stated, in essence, that although Shanghai's police expenditure reached 4.7 million taels this year, with a population of one million in the Settlement, the per capita cost was only 4.7 taels, which was not significant compared to London's per capita police expenditure of one pound. In 1927, Chinese officials and civilians, as well as certain groups, sent letters to the Police Department praising their handling of kidnapping cases, noting that the number of kidnapping cases was 27, only three more than this year. Yet, the Chinese praised them in 1927 but criticized them this year, hence the "forgetfulness." Furthermore, the editorial stated that, according to the Chief of Police's report, when kidnappers negotiated with victims, they relied on influential officials and civilians within the Settlement as shields to avoid arrest. The newspaper also believed that the Ratepayers' Association's letter to the Municipal Council was intended to undermine the ruling power of foreigners within the Settlement. It is now reported that the Chinese taxpayers believe the newspaper's editorial lacked sound reasoning and contained many inaccuracies. Therefore, on the 7th, they sent a letter to the newspaper to correct these errors. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>We have read your editorial "Forgetfulness" published on December 29th of last year. We find the points you raised inappropriate. (1) Your editorial mentions that while London's police expenditure is high, the cost of living and expenses in London are vastly different from those in Shanghai. It is difficult for Chinese residents to consider the per capita police expenditure of 4.7 taels per year in the Settlement as insignificant. Furthermore, are there frequent kidnapping cases in London? Or is it only Shanghai that sees them occurring so often? (2) The ineffectiveness of the current Police Department in handling theft cases cannot be concealed by citing letters of praise from years ago. The Police Department's expenditure has been increasing annually for the past six years, while the crime statistics have fluctuated erratically. Please observe the following table:</p>
<p>Year 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930</p>
<p>Police Expenditure 2,279,099 taels 2,537,464 taels 2,937,118 taels 3,220,476 taels 3,861,180 taels 5,448,960 taels</p>
<p>Police Expenditure Increase Rate 100% 12% 29% 141% 269% 139%</p>
<p>Number of Kidnapping Cases 20 cases 5 cases 27 cases 49 cases 38 cases 30 cases</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case Increase/Decrease Rate 100% 25% 135% 245% 190% 125%</p>
<p>Moreover, the above-mentioned police expenditure is only part of the cost borne by the shopkeepers and residents for the city's public security. Due to the repeated occurrence of criminal cases within the Settlement in recent years, important institutions have hired gatekeepers, and wealthy residents carry bodyguards. Although these security expenses are not included in the Municipal Council's budget, they should also be included when discussing public security expenses within the Settlement. (3) The editorial states that influential residents within the Settlement act as shields for kidnappers. If this is true, then the Police Department has failed in its duty by not prosecuting them. If this is not the case, then the Police Department should not fabricate incidents to evade responsibility. (4) The editorial also claims that letters from various Chinese groups are intended to undermine the ruling power of foreigners within the Settlement. This is illogical, as the Municipal Council has both Chinese and foreign directors and should not be regarded as a foreign ruling body. Taxpayers pay taxes to maintain the Municipal Council and should have the right to supervise its measures, criticize its dereliction of duty, and promptly urge it to maintain public order. The letters from various groups to the Municipal Council merely express the collective public opinion of the Chinese within the Settlement. The rampant kidnappings and the decline of prosperity within the Settlement affect all residents, regardless of nationality. Evasive arguments are of no help. In summary, the urgent task now is for the Municipal Council to adopt active measures to fundamentally eliminate the problem. The entire resident community will certainly assist in this endeavor.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Unified Cotton Yarn Tax</h3>
<p>Regulations Still Awaiting Decision by the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>Collection Personnel Have Been Assigned to Various Locations</p>
<p>There is Talk of Implementing a Three-Tier Tax Rate</p>
<p>The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reports that the nationwide unified cotton yarn tax case was not passed by the Legislative Yuan at the end of last year. The Ministry of Finance originally scheduled to bring it up for discussion again on the 6th of this month. The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association sent two representatives, Zhang Zemin and Qian Chengxu, to Nanjing to negotiate. However, the meeting could not be held that day due to the large number of absent legislators, and no results were obtained. Therefore, the traditional implementation date of the unified tax, either the 15th of this month or February 1st, is still only speculation. In general, the tax will be implemented as soon as the regulations are promulgated. Currently, the cotton yarn of the various factories in Shanghai can still be shipped as before, as the abolition of likin has already been implemented in the provinces along the Yangtze River. However, according to news from the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, the Ministry of Finance's unified tax collectors for the various factories in Gudi have all been assigned. The Henan Yufeng Yarn Factory has even stationed troops in the factory to enforce the tax. Regarding the cotton yarn unified tax rate, it was originally set that 23 counts and below would be considered coarse yarn, and above 23 counts would be considered fine yarn. It is now rumored that the Ministry of Finance intends to change to a three-tier tax system, namely, 17 counts and below as one tier, above 17 counts up to 23 counts as one tier, and above 23 counts as one tier. The tax amounts will be 2 yuan, 3 yuan, and 4 yuan, respectively.</p>

The group's first task will be to register the value of the bondholders' bonds.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Pacification and Rehabilitation Association</h3>
<p>Preparing for Shanghai Branch</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Pacification and Rehabilitation Association held its first preparatory meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday. Over twenty people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Mu Ouchu, Lin Kanghou, Xu Ji'e, Gao Fengchi, Zhang Weiru, Yan Esheng, and Zheng Chengqing. Mu Ouchu was elected as the temporary chairman. After the formalities, the chairman reported on the initiation of the Jiangsu Pacification and Rehabilitation Association and the tasks undertaken by the Shanghai branch, namely, to enable Shanghai's banking industry to assist the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank in providing loans to farmers. The matters to be discussed today are: (1) Whether the branch should be established immediately; (2) How to proceed. Subsequently, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and Cheng Xiechun expressed their opinions. After discussion, it was resolved to appoint Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Xu Ji'e, Yuan Ludeng, Ye Huijun, Mu Ouchu, and Lin Kanghou as the drafting committee for the branch's charter. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>General Assembly of Trade Association Representatives</h3>
<p>Resolved to Abolish the Trade Regulations Committee</p>
<p>The various trade associations in this city, in order to fight for the issue of trade regulations, specially organized the Trade Regulations Protection Committee. As previously reported, due to the case of common compliance with the trade regulations of various industries, it was approved by the Executive Yuan. Therefore, in the afternoon, the third general assembly of representatives was convened at the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from over a hundred organizations such as the Southern Goods Industry, Intestine Industry, New Medicine Industry, Knitting Industry, Department Store Industry, Pollen Industry, Brick and Ash Industry, and Rickshaw Industry, including Zheng Chengqing, Ye Jiaxing, and Sun Choucheng, attended. Chairman Zheng Chengqing presided over the meeting. Chairman Zheng Chengqing reported that, "Representatives, today we are holding the third general assembly of representatives of various industries to address the issue of trade regulations. This meeting was originally scheduled to be held earlier because the trade regulations that we have fought for were approved by the Executive Yuan on December 17th of last year, as reported in the newspapers. However, the committee believed that the news was brief and uncertain, so it was decided to wait for the official approval before convening the meeting. At the same time, the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce was requested to organize a trade regulations committee to handle all trade regulation matters after the conclusion of this meeting. The approval order from the Executive Yuan arrived at the end of the year, so the meeting was delayed until today. We deeply know that trade regulations have a long history in the history of Chinese commerce. This approval is merely an added layer of protection on the existing system and should not be considered a joyful event. However, in the past, although there was a trade regulation system, it was ineffective because various industries could not use it well. In the future, we should follow the instructions of the approval order and use it well so that we can obtain full benefits. Fortunately, the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce has now agreed to our request and organized a trade regulation review committee. In the future, the trade regulations of various industries will first be reviewed by the review committee and then submitted to the official authorities for approval. It is thought that after this procedure, there will be a better path. This is a point worth reporting. In this effort to fight for trade regulations, all trade associations have been very enthusiastic and united, so the result is relatively satisfactory. We should recognize this process: that in the future, no matter what happens, as long as it is needed in fact and permitted by law, we must unite together and help each other to achieve the desired goal and increase the protection of our trade associations. Therefore, I hope that the representatives will not think that the trade regulation issue has been resolved today, and that this very precious and valuable spirit of unity will be dissolved. We must continue to increase unity, so that the foundation of our trade associations can be strengthened and there will be hope for the development of industry and commerce." After the report was completed, the discussion began and it was resolved: (1) to immediately abolish the Trade Regulations Protection Committee and transfer it to the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce for reception; (2) to establish a trade association consultation office as a place for inquiries and communication, but not to deal with the outside world in its name. The meeting adjourned after the resolution.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Trade Association Trade Regulations Protection Committee sent a letter to the various trade associations yesterday, stating: "To the Editor, all trade regulations approved for record by the various trade associations, whether or not they have joined the association, should be observed. This case has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The committee was organized by representatives of various industries as an expedient measure. Now that the trade regulations have been approved, the mission seems to have been completed. Therefore, according to the resolution of the third general assembly of representatives, starting from January 9th, all procedures can be completely concluded. In addition to cutting and destroying the seals, transferring the files and books, and the remaining funds to the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce for safekeeping, a report will be compiled on the progress, the approval order of the Executive Yuan, and a summary of income and expenditure. A copy is enclosed for your reference.</p>
<h3>Postal Co-Director M.T. Toussaint Requests Two Months' Sick Leave</h3>
<p>The "New Shanghai" reports that M.T. Toussaint, co-director of the Directorate General of Posts, previously requested two months of leave from the Ministry of Communications in mid-December of last year due to his weak health and urgent need for recuperation in order to choose a place for convalescence. It is now learned that Wang Boqun, Minister of Communications, has approved the leave starting from January 1st of this year. It is heard that Mr. Toussaint will return to his country for a trip. The position of co-director left vacant has been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to be temporarily filled by Qian Chunqi, a technician of the Ministry. Mr. Qian arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to assume his duties.</p>

<h3>Special Shipping News</h3>
<p>The "Xinfeng" Case Submitted for Public Adjudication Last year, the "Xinfeng" of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was damaged by the Japanese "Kageyama Maru" of Nippon Yusen, resulting in a loss of 40,000 yuan. The company ordered the Tianjin branch to negotiate with the Nippon Yusen Coastal Branch nearby to claim compensation. For several months, the Japanese side has taken a perfunctory attitude and has not recognized the compensation. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has now sent a final official letter to Nippon Yusen, demanding compensation, and stating that if no decision is made, the case will be submitted for public adjudication. The Tianjin Customs River Department will also be requested to act as a notary to prove the responsibility for the accident.</p>
<p>Jiujiang Water Freight Agreed Last winter, six companies increased the shallow water fees on the Yangtze River. Among them, the water freight at the port of Jiujiang, due to repeated increases, has become even higher than the freight rate in Hankou, which has aroused the opposition of all Jiangxi merchants. The Xunshang Chamber of Commerce and the Nanshan Transportation Bureau have repeatedly telegraphed the various shipping companies in Shanghai to cancel the shallow water fee. The six companies convened a public meeting on this matter yesterday, and it was decided to reduce the Jiujiang freight rate by 12% of the current rate, while the added 15% shallow water fee must still be maintained to maintain uniformity. The Jiangxi merchants will be telegraphed today for verification.</p>
<p>Nanyang Chinese Ships Increase Troops On the Nanhua route, where there are the most pirates, British Tai Koo and Jardine have added twelve armed guards to each ship since last winter to protect the escort, making the journey safer. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also fully resumed the Nanhua route and is planning to add two new ships to operate the Shantou-Xiamen-Guangdong line. In order to ensure the safety of navigation, it has also been decided to increase the number of armed guards on each ship to twelve, following the example of British ships. Box guns will be used to protect the ship, and it will be implemented on February 1.</p>

<h3>Anti-Opium Society Sends Letter to the Opium Prohibition Committee</h3>
<p>Requesting Complete Prohibition of Opium</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society sent a letter to the Central Opium Prohibition Committee yesterday, stating: "To the Editor, it has recently been heard from various sources that your committee has changed its policy of completely prohibiting opium and is now preparing to implement a national opium monopoly, which is shocking. On January 1st, a declaration of opium prohibition was issued to express the people's views. Our society hopes that the rumors are not true. The English opium prohibition declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the government is currently preparing to manage the national opium trade, and that in the future, the import and export of raw opium will be managed by an internal organization. The intention is unknown. Premier Sun Yat-sen's will clearly stipulates that 'the opium business can never coexist with the National Government that the people have entrusted with power.' It also states that 'anyone who advocates that the law should permit the opium business is an enemy of public opinion, and any responsible government agency that lowers the flag and ceases to fight against opium for its own private convenience, whether temporarily or permanently, is an act of betraying the country.' Furthermore, complete opium prohibition is stipulated in the platform of the Kuomintang, and the prohibition policy is also required by the national public. The National Government promulgated the opium prohibition law on July 25th of the 18th year, demonstrating the government's determination to prohibit opium. Although the implementation in various places has not been strong in recent years, such as the opium special tax in Hunan and Hubei, the open trade in Guangdong and Guangxi, and the cultivation of opium in Sichuan, Fujian, Yunnan, and Guizhou, which have been criticized by the Chinese people, the policy of complete prohibition should not be shifted due to this. Just as the saying goes, 'Do not refuse to eat for fear of choking.' The official statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the outside world clearly states that the government is currently preparing to manage the national opium trade, which means that the government will recognize opium as a business permitted by law. If so, it will not only violate the previous opium prohibition law but also violate the Kuomintang platform, violate international treaties, and violate Premier Sun Yat-sen's will. Our society, which is engaged in anti-opium activities, has always taken it as its responsibility to express the people's wishes. This method is deeply unacceptable. During the recent Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the party and government officials made a resolution to strictly enforce opium prohibition. The government is right to vigorously promote the opium prohibition law, so that there is hope for the elimination of opium, to comfort the people who are longing for governance internally and to correct international public opinion externally. If the policy of prohibition is abandoned and the monopoly is taken as a substitute, it will not only be unpopular with the people but also contrary to the trend of revolution. Moreover, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Ministry of Finance implemented the opium monopoly in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After several times of public opposition, the government resolutely decided to cancel the monopoly and sacrificed 40 million yuan in tax revenue annually. It also established the Opium Prohibition Committee to preside over the national opium prohibition. For the past two years, due to internal wars, it has failed to achieve results that satisfy the people, but the Chinese people can still understand its difficulties. Now that the internal wars have been quelled, it is a good opportunity for complete opium prohibition, but to make a plan for monopoly is truly beyond reason and something that our society cannot believe. It is still remembered that when your committee held the first National Opium Prohibition Conference two years ago, representatives of all parties in the country and people's organizations gathered together and passed 44 resolutions on completely prohibiting opium. Party and government dignitaries attended the conference and gave speeches, all advocating complete prohibition. If the monopoly is now implemented, disregarding the public opinion of the government and the people, it will run counter to the purpose of establishing your committee. Since January, people from all walks of life who are concerned about opium prohibition have come to the society to report, wanting to clarify your committee's attitude towards the policy of complete prohibition. Based on the resolution of the Standing Committee, we will request your committee to clarify whether the above rumors are true, in order to dispel doubts, and we will be happy to answer this humble request. With this announcement, we respectfully wish you good planning and look forward to hearing from you. To the Opium Prohibition Committee.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Receives Jiangxi Disaster Report Yesterday</h3>
<p>Extreme Human Tragedy</p>
<p>The Red Cross Society of China received a letter from the Jiangxi Fellow Provincial Disaster Relief Association in Yangzhou yesterday, requesting aid, along with a disaster map. The letter stated that the property loss was approximately 386,949,900 yuan, the number of houses burned was approximately 87,224, the number of people massacred was 128,075, and the number of refugees was 1,615,100. The above numbers were collected by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Department based on survey reports from various county party departments from May to August of the 19th year. Only 61 counties have submitted survey forms. The significant losses after the capture of Ji'an and Jingdezhen cities are not included. Jiangxi Province has a total of 81 counties, with 34 counties completely affected by bandits, 20 counties half affected by bandits, and 19 counties with bandits not yet cleared. Only 8 counties, including Nanchang, have not been affected by bandits. The relief request stated, "The comrades who are writing this are in a state of confusion and are unconsciously incoherent. In the past two months, they have been calling for help and running around. Even the loss of their parents is not as deeply painful. The disaster situation can be described as an extreme human tragedy."</p>
<h3>Jisheng Society Seeks Relief for Xuanhua Disaster Victims on Behalf</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society recently received a letter and telegram from She Guisheng, director of the relief office in Tianjin, stating that Xuanhua County has suffered greatly in recent years due to the fact that Mongolia has been instigated by Russia to blockade commercial undertakings. Xuanhua's former means of livelihood has therefore been severely affected. Unexpectedly, it suffered a drought last year. More than 60,000 people were most severely affected. It is difficult for one county to provide relief, and it has no choice but to seek assistance from outside. It is clear that the headquarters has many relief locations and is economically exhausted, but thinking of the victims, without food or clothing, in this freezing weather, the situation is extremely pitiful and there is no choice but to appeal to the headquarters. The society was hesitant and difficult after receiving the telegram. The society is currently handling the Shaanxi Wugong porridge factory, from one to four, and jointly handling the Jiangxi emergency relief with the Morality Society. Director Zhang Xianqing set off that day. The economic difficulties can be imagined. It is hoped that the benevolent people in all circles, while warming themselves by the fire and wearing warm clothes, will spare a thought for the suffering of the victims in the icy and snowy weather, and they will surely be able to save countless victims.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Bans Foreign Ship Stevedores</h3>
<p>Directs Social Affairs Bureau to Investigate with Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of foreign ship stevedores mistreating Chinese laborers, the Shanghai Municipal Government issued instructions to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday: Regarding the matter of issuing instructions, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs document Cun Zi No. 795, it states: "To the Shanghai Municipal Government: According to the General Association of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union Rectification Committee's report, which is based on a report from the Shanghai branch, which is based on reports from the Yan Ying General Agency and others, foreign shipping companies have recently hired Chinese laborers, and their rights are entirely controlled by the stevedores. Mistreatment and oppression, ingratiating themselves with foreigners, imposing harsh contracts, extorting activity fees, and smuggling contraband are the most prominent offenses, and there are also instances of privately reducing wages. Please investigate and handle this matter." After investigation, the practice of contracting labor was previously subject to regulations, but local ruffians still exploit foreigners to engage in abusive behavior. Law, discipline, and humanity are all violated. Local authorities should conduct timely investigations and strictly enforce the law to protect the innocent. In addition to forwarding this to the relevant departments, the original report is attached for reference and handling." This case was previously consulted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to investigate and respond. A report has not yet been received. Based on the aforementioned document, the attached document is copied and sent to the Social Affairs Bureau, ordering them to immediately investigate and strictly enforce the law in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau, and to report the findings for further response. This order.</p>

<h3>Lide Oil Factory Scheduled to Resume Operations Today</h3>
<p>Workers Have Accepted Government Advice</p>

To prevent the labor unrest from escalating, the city Party headquarters sent representatives to provide guidance, but due to the workers' insistence, no results were achieved. Currently, the Social Affairs Bureau, due to the union's failure to surrender its seal and registration certificate and its refusal to resume work, has sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to revoke the license and issued a joint public notice with the Municipal Party Headquarters' Civil Training Committee, ordering the workers to resume work and approving the factory to hire new workers if the workers still refuse to resume work.

<p>○ Director Huang Will Invite Shipping Industry Representatives for Tea Tomorrow</p>
<p>Shipping Industry Will Host a Banquet the Same Afternoon in Return</p>

<h3>Huangpu River Bridge Imminent</h3>
<p>Floating Bridge Design Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>Copper Bridge Design Now Planned</p>
<p>Submitted to Authorities for Approval</p>
<p>Construction to Commence Upon Approval</p>
<p>Regarding the plan to build a bridge over the Huangpu River, the originator of the plan said yesterday that the project is actively underway, and the funds have been raised. Construction can begin once approved by the Municipal Government and the Construction Committee. The location is temporarily not being disclosed to prevent speculators from buying up land, but it will be near Dongjiadu and the Bund. When submitting the application to the Municipal Government, a design was attached. The design was originally planned by Mu Shuzai and others several years ago and is for a floating bridge. However, when submitting it to the Municipal Government for approval, the initiators believed that although the construction and cost of the floating bridge were simpler and more economical, bridge construction is a public service and not comparable to profit-making. Therefore, for the sake of permanence, it is intended to disregard the floating bridge design and commission a certain country's engineer stationed in Shanghai to draw a steel bridge design. Although the cost and construction are larger and slower, it is worthwhile for the development of the Pudong area. The steel bridge design has also been submitted to the Municipal Government for adoption. It is said that the most important reason for abandoning the floating bridge design is that it cannot last long, and another major reason is that the floating bridge design is not suitable for the Huangpu River, which is experiencing urban prosperity. The floating bridge design is slightly similar to the floating piers on the Bund of Sanma Road. Although the tide can rise and fall freely, the high and low tides will inevitably cause a tendency to be biased. Furthermore, many vehicles will use the bridge in the future. When heavy vehicles pass over this floating pier-style bridge in the future, the height will inevitably be uncertain. For these reasons, we are willing to sacrifice the original proposal and seek a more stable and permanent steel bridge plan. After the Construction Committee and the Municipal Government approve it, a meeting must be convened by the initiators and prominent figures in Shanghai who have participated in the project before construction begins. It is said that Zhang Jingjiang, chairman of the Construction Committee, recently sent a letter to Mayor Zhang Qun to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Nie Dianbang Escorted to Beijing</h3>
<p>To be Handled by the General Headquarters' Law Department</p>
<p>The suspect Nie Dianbang, who assassinated Mr. Chen Yingshi, was arrested the other day, as previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the General Headquarters in the capital believes that the capture of this great traitor requires serious handling. Mr. Chen's death</p>
<p>The Entire Scheme Was a Political Conspiracy</p>
<p>(Photo by Songshixuan)</p>
<p>Not Within the Jurisdiction of the Judicial Authorities</p>
<p>Therefore, a telegram was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government instructing them to escort Nie Dianbang to Beijing for interrogation. Mayor Zhang immediately sent a section member to the local court prosecutor's office to meet Chief Prosecutor Liu Maochu to handle the reception procedures. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the Public Security Bureau was instructed to send three detectives to the local court to receive the suspect. Prosecutor Zhao opened the court and, according to Nie's testimony, he is 42 years old, from Shandong Province. In the fifth year of the Republic, when Mr. Chen was assassinated, I was singing in Little Luzon. I have never left Shanghai since coming here. This time, I was framed by enemies. The official then stated that the court is acting under the electric order from General Jiang requesting that you be handed over to the Municipal Government for escort to Nanjing for interrogation. After signing the document, he was taken to the Public Security Bureau by detectives from the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention, and he is scheduled to be transferred to the General Headquarters in Nanjing for handling today. The suspect was wearing a leather hat worth more than one hundred yuan and a leopard skin-faced blue satin coat worth only more than four hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Civil Mediation in the Special District Court</h3>
<p>Litigants Should First Submit a Mediation Request</p>
<p>Without Having to Pay Any Fees</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the Special District Local Court has mediated all civil cases first. Only if a peaceful resolution cannot be reached will a trial be held. This innovative method will not only reduce the number of lawsuits but also greatly benefit the litigants. This is truly a good policy that has never existed before. In the past, plaintiffs in civil lawsuits had to pay litigation fees based on the amount they sought, sometimes amounting to thousands of gold. Although there were provisions for requesting assistance to temporarily waive fees for plaintiffs without such financial resources, it was a troublesome process. Now, it is no longer necessary to directly submit a lawsuit. Instead, a request for mediation should be submitted in duplicate. If there are two defendants, two copies of the request should be submitted, and so on. The original copy of the mediation request costs five cents of silver, and the duplicate copy costs two cents of silver. The difference in price between this and the current price of civil lawsuit documents is significant. Furthermore, no litigation fee is required when submitting a mediation request. Only if mediation fails is it necessary to purchase lawsuit documents and pay litigation fees in accordance with the law. Therefore, if the case is resolved through mediation, the cost of the documents is not as high as in the past, and there is no need to pay litigation fees. This is a tangible benefit for the litigants themselves. In addition, cases resolved through mediation do not involve delays or the trouble of going to court, which is an intangible benefit. Moreover, the qualifications of the mediators are very strict. Lawyers cannot be appointed as mediators to avoid the abuse of soliciting and manipulating cases. The general public believes that this method is truly good, but the lawyers' business will inevitably suffer a major blow.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Seller Beaten After Patrolmen Intervened for Failure to Donate Certificates</h3>
<p>Selling Vegetables Without a Certificate</p>
<p>Escaped into a British Home</p>
<p>Two Patrolmen Chased to Investigate</p>
<p>Beaten Up in the Kitchen</p>
<p>Li Jinlin, Qin Zanting, Wu Maomao, Xu Shengtin, and others, servants of British resident G. Wu at No. 1 Taopeng Road, were accused of assaulting Chinese patrolmen No. 1086 and No. 2708 of the Yangshupu Police Station. The case was tried by Judge Feng of the Special District Local Court. According to Li Zhishan, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, the incident occurred when Zhang, the wife of the defendant Xu Shengtin, was selling vegetables in the Pingliang Road vegetable market at 10:30 AM on the previous morning without donating certificates. The two patrolmen questioned her, and Zhang, feeling guilty, fled into the residence of British resident G. Wu with her vegetable basket to hide. The two patrolmen chased after her, but the defendants forcibly dragged the two patrolmen into the kitchen and insulted them. Chinese patrolman No. 1086 was stabbed in the left shoulder with a knife, and his clothes were torn, but fortunately he was not injured. Chinese patrolman No. 2708 was severely injured and is still in the hospital. He requested that the case be adjourned. The weapons, an iron bar and a sharp knife, were presented as evidence. Then, Russian patrolman Mike Lao Fu reported the situation at the time, stating that he heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, where he saw Chinese patrolman No. 1086 standing at the back door of the British residence, his head bleeding. He said that Chinese patrolman No. 2708 was attacked inside the house. He entered the house and saw the Chinese patrolman lying in the kitchen. The two defendants, Li and Qin, were still attacking him. Then, Chinese patrolman No. 1086 testified that when Zhang was trying to avoid the certificate inspection, she fled into the British residence, and he and No. 2708 chased after her. However, the defendants forcibly interfered and shouted and attacked them. Xu Shengtin struck him on the head with an iron hammer, and Li Jinlin stabbed him in the left shoulder with a knife. No. 2708 was knocked down, his weapons were snatched away, and there were seven or eight assailants. He jumped out of the window and was then assisted by Chinese patrolman No. 1049. Chinese patrolman No. 1049 testified that he was also at the scene when he questioned Zhang. Because the two patrolmen were chasing in front and he rushed over, the two patrolmen were trapped inside the house. He then used the telephone to report to the police station, and detectives were dispatched to help, and the defendants were arrested. Li Jinlin testified that the two patrolmen chased Zhang into the house and beat Xu Shengtin. He was also beaten for trying to persuade them and denied stabbing the Chinese patrolman in the left shoulder with a knife. Qin Zanting testified that he was identified as an assailant for trying to mediate. Wu Maomao also denied committing the assault. Zhang Shengtin claimed that it was true that his wife was selling vegetables without donating certificates, but he had pleaded with the two patrolmen at the time, but not only was he not forgiven, but he was forcibly beaten by them. Judge Feng ordered the defendants to be remanded into custody because Chinese patrolman No. 2708 was still being treated in the hospital, and the hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Uproar Over the "Dumb Love" Film</h3>
<p>Step-Mother and Elder Brother Dissatisfied with the Plot</p>
<p>Sue the Film Company in Court</p>
<p>The "Dumb Love" case of Lin Jiren and Wu Airong became a sensation in Shanghai after its successful conclusion. Subsequently, the Xishen Film Company, opened by Ren Xifan on Qingyun Road in Zhabei, filmed the story with Lin and Wu as the protagonists, and the parties involved also appeared in various theaters to speak about their experiences, which had considerable appeal. However, the film included a scene with Wu's step-mother and Wu's brother, which caused her step-mother Wu Yangmin and her elder brother Wu Baolun to feel greatly ashamed. They requested the court to ban the public screening of the film, but this was not approved. Therefore, Wu Yangmin and Wu Baolun were very dissatisfied. They hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint in the local court against Ren Xifan, as well as the director Chen Zhuomin and the photographer Zhang Fukang, for defamation, requesting prosecution and filing a private claim for damages. Judge Ma Shounan heard the case in the fifth court yesterday at 10:00 AM. Wu Baolun and Chen Zhuomin did not appear, and Ren Xifan and Zhang Fukang also appeared in court with a lawyer. First, Wu Yangmin testified that she is 43 years old, from Guangdong, and lives at No. 9 Yipin Lane, Qiujiang Road. Wu Baolun is my biological son, and he works at the telephone company. He did not come today. Wu Airong is the daughter of Wu Guo, my first wife. The reason I filed the lawsuit is because the Xifan Company filmed a scene in which I beat Wu Airong, but I did not do that. There is also a scene that falsely accuses my son Baolun of introducing Wu Airong to Lin and later getting involved in the lawsuit. Baolun also acted as a mediator. My mother and son have been completely defamed. Originally, my family did not want Lin Jiren and Wu Airong to be together, so Lin Jiren received a two-month prison sentence, which was suspended. Now, they are making money using our names, so I request that they be convicted, the film be canceled, and damages be paid. Ren Xifan testified that he is 51 years old, from Ninghai, Zhejiang, and lives at No. 203 Qingyun Road. The Wu Airong film was commissioned by the Shishi Film Company to be filmed on its behalf because the company was newly established and did not have a filming location. Liang Zhongfen introduced me to them. In addition to Lin Jiren and Wu Airong, most of the actors were hired temporarily. Regarding the part about her brother and mother, I first asked the Film Inspection Committee to check it, fearing it would involve defamation. Therefore, I did not write that it was her biological brother but rather her cousin Wu Baolin, and the step-mother was simply written as Wu Airong's step-mother. The script was written by Wu Airong herself. She said that her step-mother not only beat her but also told her to have an abortion. What we made was that after Wu Airong ran away, her biological mother beat her, and her step-mother also hit her with a chicken feather duster. Regarding the part about her brother mediating, it was written that her cousin was the "most powerful mediator" because her cousin persuaded Wu Guo to accept the matter after Wu ran away. However, Wu Airong was responsible for the filming, but it was entirely because the Cantonese people in the Shishi Film Company saw that the deaf-mute man was very poor and would not even have food to eat, so they founded a film company and commissioned us to film it. Whenever Wu Airong went to a public screening, the court would persuade him after he won the lawsuit, and I would give him 50 yuan, otherwise he would have nothing, but he could not maintain his livelihood without it, so his biological mother did not object. The film is still in my company. Originally, there were also people from other places who came to buy it, but because the lawsuit was not yet settled, it was not sold. But my company is acting as an intermediary for the Shishi Film Company, although I manage it, the ownership belongs to others. Zhang Fukang testified that he is 25 years old, from Lanxi, and he photographed in the Xifan company. I am the director. I shoot whatever they tell me to shoot. I am completely not responsible. At this point, Wu Yangmin immediately said that the defendant said that he had changed Wu Baolun to Wu Baolin, but the pronunciation is the same but the characters are different, and the step-mother is me, and I did not give my consent, so I asked her lawyer to make further demands, saying that according to Ren Xifan's testimony, the crime is clear, and I requested that he be detained. The judge then stated that the parties involved in this case have not yet appeared, and it needs to be retried. Based on the plaintiff's request, he ordered Ren Xifan to post bail to be released and to be available whenever he is summoned. The case will be heard again, and then the court adjourned.</p>

Sheng Cheng spoke, agreeing with Hu's proposal, saying that his already written "My Mother and I," "Ten Years of Work-Study Abroad," and the unwritten "East and West" were all about developing national character. He described his impressions of traveling to Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Greece, Mesopotamia, and India, believing that China was the only country in the world with a family tree, with an unbroken system for over two thousand years, so that the East could regain its glory through the Renaissance. Next, Shao Humei read a new poem, "Xunmei's Dream." Then, Secretary Ge Gongzhen reported on the club's affairs, and the meeting ended in great joy.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>Hai Ke</p>
<p>Millionaire (Very ill and dying, struggling on his sickbed.) | I'm dying soon. You must take good care of the money I leave behind.</p>
<p>Son | Father, I will naturally take good care of it. I dare not waste the money you worked so hard to earn.</p>
<p>Millionaire | People owe me a lot of money. Several notes. I will say their names. You write them down one by one. (So he said the names of several people.)</p>
<p>Son | I heard that Father owes people money as well. There are also several notes. Please say their names as well so that I can return them.</p>
<p>Millionaire | You don't need to worry about the money I owe people. When they die, they will naturally tell their sons about the money they owe people, just like me.</p>
<p>New Maid (Speaking to her mistress) | Madam, I don't want to work here anymore.</p>
<p>Mistress | Why? You haven't been here for many days. Why do you want to leave so soon?</p>
<p>New Maid | It's just that Mr. C comes to visit Miss every night. It affects my reputation.</p>
<p>Mistress | That's strange. He is Miss's boyfriend. It has nothing to do with you.</p>
<p>New Maid | But I am still young, and my face is not bad. The neighbors on the left and right are probably going to think that Mr. C is visiting me. Wouldn't that affect my reputation?</p>
<p>Girl A | Miss Wang owes the tailor a lot of money. She wants her fiancé to pay it off together before she will marry him.</p>
<p>Girl B | Then has he paid it off for her?</p>
<p>Girl A | He doesn't have that much money, so he is persuading her to marry the tailor.</p>
<h3>A New Discovery: The Nose Can Tell Time</h3>
<p>Chen Shuping</p>
<p>Besides those who suffer from syphilis, everyone in the world is born with a nose. But we only know that it has a sense of smell and is responsible for breathing. Unexpectedly, it also has the function of telling time. After hearing this, everyone must say that I am exaggerating, thinking that since there are no numbers marked on the nose, nor long and short hands, how can it report the time? You must know that the nose's report is entirely based on distinguishing between blockage and unobstructedness. Only you can feel it yourself, not report it to others. After I discovered that the nose's blockage and unobstructedness were related to the time of day, I began to study it in detail. I then learned that each nostril reports one hour of the day, and it is different for men and women. For the twelve hours of the day, a man's left nostril reports the hour of the Rat (11 PM - 1 AM), and his right nostril reports the hour of the Ox (1 AM - 3 AM), and so on. Women, on the other hand, are the opposite. The hour of the Rat is on the right side. The method of distinguishing is that, for example, when it comes to the hour of the Rat, we feel that the left nostril is more unobstructed than the right nostril when breathing. Women, on the other hand, feel that the right nostril is more unobstructed. When testing at the intersection of two hours, the effect is even more significant. If everyone doesn't believe me, you can try it on the spot. However, I must declare in advance that when you have a cold and your nose is blocked, it's like a cuckoo clock stopping, and you definitely won't be able to test any effect. According to the opinion of my friend Dr. Qin Jishi, the nose's ability to tell time is a normal phenomenon. There is nothing mysterious or strange about it. It is only because the human body is a very complex machine, and the flow of qi and blood never stops day and night, resulting in the nostrils' breathing blockage and unobstructedness changing at any time. This view has a sufficient basis. I am now recording it in Free Talk, sharing it with my fellow writers because I can't bear to keep it a secret. However, when clock shop owners see it, they will probably suspect that I am stealing their business. A laugh.</p>

<h3>Autumn News from Beiping</h3>
<p>Cautious</p>
<p>Well-known cross-dressing opera performer Cheng Yushuang, famous in Beijing and Shanghai, has returned north with great acclaim. She has accepted an engagement with the Zhonghe Theater and performs three days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). There is not an empty seat. Recently, she has abstained from tobacco and alcohol, and her voice is excellent. Therefore, she is very popular with opera fans. On the evening of December 29th, the business community presented 武家坡 [Wu Jia Po] and 弓硯緣 [The Romance of Bow and Inkstone]. The theater was packed. People were surprised that it was a rare sight. On the 30th, there was a heavy snowstorm. She performed 寶蓮燈 [Baolian Lantern]. The audience numbered over 900 people. On the evening of the 31st, the snowstorm continued. She performed 硃痕記 [Zhu Hen Ji]. The audience numbered over 1,000 people. That evening, Shang Xiaoyun performed the entire 白蛇傳 [Legend of the White Snake] and added 蠟廟 [Wax Temple]. The audience numbered over 300 people. Xun Huisheng performed 元宵謎 [Lantern Festival Riddles]. The audience numbered over 400 people. On New Year's Eve in Beiping, the famous opera performers competed to perform excellent plays. The audience did not let the wind and snow deter them. It was quite a scene of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, Yushuang took an early train to Lü to fulfill her engagement with the Mingxing Theater. She performed 玉堂春 [Yutangchun] on the first evening, 碧玉簪 [Biyu Zan] on the second evening, 柳迎春 [Liu Yingchun] on the third evening, and 金鎖記 [Jin Suo Ji] on the fourth evening. The ticket price was three yuan. All tickets were sold out before the 30th. In addition to studying Sinology, Yushuang is creating new plays. She plans to stage ten plays within a year, all based on having thought and meaning as the criteria. The one that has been completed is 荒山淚 [Tears on a Barren Mountain]. Mr. Li Shizeng praised it greatly and renamed it 祈禱和平 [Pray for Peace]. The ones that are being drafted are named 和平之神 [Goddess of Peace] and 春閨夢 [Spring Boudoir Dreams]. Yushuang's efforts in art are evident. Mr. Li Shizeng once said that a certain director of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, when he saw Yushuang's play in Beiping, said that if Yushuang came to Nanjing to perform, the national affairs could be peaceful. When Yushuang went to Beijing in November to perform charity shows, it coincided with the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the North-South Unification. A certain gentleman's prediction came true. Therefore, Beijing called Yushuang the Goddess of Peace.</p>
<h3>New Year's New Banquet</h3>
<p>Xin Chao</p>
<p>On the evening of the fourth day of the new year, Wang Yansong, the owner of the Da Xin Silk and Satin Bureau, hosted a grand banquet for various circles at the Atlantic, with over 500 people. People from the party, government, businesses, and various other circles were all present. It can truly be called the grandest New Year celebration banquet in Shanghai.</p>
<p>During the banquet, Mr. Wang Yansong explained his ambition in establishing Da Xin, which is to promote domestic goods. Therefore, he spared no effort in collecting all kinds of high-quality American-made silk and satin. Mr. Wang also elaborated on the word "beauty," saying that beauty contains the element of the times. The most fashionable three-inch golden lotuses of the past do not look beautiful now. But beautiful things are abstract. What can represent beauty in the West? As the saying goes, "Buddhas need gold clothes, and people need clothing." It can be seen that clothing can fundamentally represent beauty.</p>
<p>Sitting next to Mr. Wang was a female guest dressed in student attire. Many people mistakenly took her for the hostess. Some even asked Mr. Wang about this. After Mr. Wang explained, it turned out that she was Tang Naixin, the younger sister of Tang Boqi, the director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, and a female reporter for the New Voice News Agency.</p>
<p>Miss Xi, a senior student at a Chinese and Western girls' school, is a Da Xin fashion enthusiast. She orders two or three new outfits from the Da Xin fashion department every month. This has attracted the attention of her classmates. A large number of people have ordered new outfits through her introduction. She also came in person on this day. She said to everyone she met, "New fashions are good." Later, she left before the end of the banquet because she had other business to attend to.</p>
<h3>Paris Tales (II)</h3>
<p>Liu Ceng, residing in Paris</p>
<p>This film is called "Alibi" (this word is difficult to translate. The general meaning is a defense by a criminal who claims that when the defendant's event occurred, he was in a place outside the crime scene). It was produced in the United States in 1929. We can think that this is probably the last silent film made by Hollywood without the help of a Microphone. This film is quite worthy of attention. I personally regret that there will not be many opportunities to encounter this kind of film in the future.</p>
<p>"Alibi" is by no means an important work. There is no amazing star in it. But this film can be said to be the crystallization of the experience that Americans have gained in the film industry for many years. All places that restrict the actions of actors, and all places that make people feel unreasonable, have been strictly avoided. This film only leaves the spectacle of a tragedy in which mankind is forever fighting and slashing each other. This tragedy is simply shrunk and printed in the struggle between the police and the bandits. The famous film "Night of Chicago" is the representative model of this type of film.</p>
<p>In this film, we can see the pure and simple beauty that those best films possess. The faces of the actors appear very natural on the screen. In fact, I feel that in any film, the plot and interweaving are only of secondary importance. The most important thing is the expression of the actors. Every glance and every raise of the hand are related to the value of the entire film. The actor has to make the audience not feel that they are watching a movie when they watch a movie. They simply live in the movie. They directly participate in the movie. That is a good scene. That is an actor worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The plot of "Alibi" is as follows:</p>
<p>When the screen first opens, a young man is released from prison. Three people are waiting for him at the gate: an elderly man, a prostitute, and a young girl. This elderly man is a hotel owner. To celebrate the young man's release from prison, he has prepared dinner at his home. Everyone drinks happily. Halfway through the drink, a man at the table runs over and asks for the address of the young girl, Joan. Joan generously gave it to him.</p>
<p>When she got home, Joan saw her father (a high-ranking police officer) talking to his friend Inspector Tom. This was the tenth time Tom had asked Joan to marry him. But this was also the tenth time Joan answered him, "I am a policeman's daughter. That is enough. I don't want to be a policeman's wife." Tom left unhappily.</p>
<p>Among the guests that day were old men in their fifties and sixties, as well as young people in their twenties and thirties. Among the guests was a certain writer. He composed a sixteen-character couplet, saying, "There are both men and women. There is no deceit for the old and the young. The eyes and ears are refreshed. Everyone is happy." The four sentences embed the two characters 大新 [Da Xin] and describe the various roles of the guests present at that time, which is very accurate.</p>
<p>Art World News: KMT Second Central Committee members Jing Hengyi and Chen Shuren have always entertained themselves with poetry and books. Even in the midst of tense situations, they indulged in their interests and made many social works. Recently, they have been living together in Tianjin. The number of requests has increased. Therefore, they have jointly ordered a painting agreement to show their intention to reduce their workload. I have now found their agreement and copied it below. The Joint Agreement of Jing Yi Yuan and Chen Shuren: Art is not a perfunctory social matter. There are too many requests. It is unavoidable to be hasty and forgetful. This is for self-encouragement. I also wish to form a painting and calligraphy relationship with general enthusiasts. Starting from the 20th year, the provisional fees are as follows: 1. Jing and Chen jointly painted Xieyi flowers, 10 yuan per square foot. 2. Chen alone does flower-and-bird landscapes, double the price. 3. Jing alone does calligraphy and painting, half price across the board. Couplets are 10 yuan, and other prices are negotiable. Fan faces and albums are calculated as one square foot. Take the item after one month for distant places. (Law News)</p>
<p>Art World News 2: Mr. Chen Gangshu Yunpei, deputy director of the Romantic Society and a famous calligrapher and painter, also known as Tiangang Waiter, studies Shangu and captures his spirit. He is proficient in the Six Canons and is skilled in everything. He is especially good at flower-and-bird paintings, drawing inspiration from Qing Teng, Yunyang, Tiannan, Bei'an, and Xinluo. He has a unique spirit, beautiful without being weak, and charming yet elegant. Therefore, he has long been respected by the art world at home and abroad. In recent years, due to his old age and decline, he often wants to let his hair down and enter the mountains, severing himself from the mundane world, to realize Xiang Ping's unfinished wishes. He reluctantly remains in Shanghai. But his ambition to burn his pen and inkstone has never waned slightly. After a little preparation, he will retire to Zhenjiang, refusing to write or paint again. Therefore, Huang Binhong, Zhang Shanzi, Xiong Songquan, Ma Qizhou, Cai Yimin, Zhang Daqian, and other members of the Romantic Society specially invited him to display dozens of his accumulated masterpieces and fine works at the Xixinglongfang Benyu on Changbang Road and Chongqing Road from the 11th for a limited period. They can also be sold at a low price. Those who like Mr. Zuo and have not yet obtained it should not miss the opportunity. (Yu Jianhua)</p>
<h3>Heartwarming Memories (3)(4)(8)</h3>
<p>Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Earnest Inquiry about Calligraphy, Cui Xiu Visits the Teacher; Generous Talk of Warfare, a Feast in the Brothel for a Female Hero</p>
<p>At that time, the "局" (gathering with singing girls) that was called for came in a continuous stream. Beautiful women surrounded the table, as if holding a round table conference. Zuo Shichen suddenly remembered something. He leaned close to the person sitting next to him, who happened to be Sun Qilei. Zuo Shichen then asked Sun Qilei, "Do you know if this Ms. Ren Peizhen also enjoys calling for "堂唱" (singing performance at a gathering)?" "Look at her, although she is a woman, she likes to be with men. Perhaps she also wants to call for a "局". We might as well ask her." Sun Qilei said, "You reminded me, I almost forgot. Someone just introduced a "堂唱" to her. She didn't refuse, but by the time I left, the "堂唱" hadn't arrived yet. I don't know if she came later." Zuo Shichen said, "Then there's a precedent to follow. Since she called for one, we can also write a "局票丁" (invitation slip) for her. May I ask who introduced her?" Sun Qilei said, "It's the famous courtesan Old Lin Daiyu, who has been well-known in Shanghai for thirty years." Zuo Shichen said, "Really? Then we must call for her. One is a great hero of the Republic of China, and the other is a famous courtesan in Shanghai. Both are famous people. Gathering together, my presence at this banquet today is not in vain." Then he took a "局票" (invitation slip) and a pen and handed them to Sun Qilei, saying, "I'm troubling you. You know she called for Old Lin Daiyu, so it will be easy to get her agreement. If she agrees, you can write it down. It's our first time meeting, so I'm a bit presumptuous." Sun Qilei said, "Speaking of first meeting, isn't it the same for me? However, she is very open and generous. Let me take on this task." Sun Qilei took the pen in hand and said to Ren Peizhen, "On the orders of the host, please invite Mr. Ren to call for a "堂唱". I don't know if the "潚湘妃子" (another name for Lin Daiyu) has come yet." Ren Peizhen said, "No need to call, right? She didn't come just now. I guess she doesn't want to come." Sun Qilei said, "There's no reason why she wouldn't want to come. She comes when anyone calls her. Probably she's just a little late. Do you know how many puffs of opium Old Lin Daiyu smokes? She has to wait until it's dark before she gets up. After she gets up, she has to satisfy her addiction first, and then she can ask about other things. People who smoke opium don't know the time. As long as there's a lamp in front of them, they don't care about anything, no matter how important. It takes two hours for her to satisfy her opium addiction, and then another one or two hours for her to comb her hair and put on makeup. Moreover, she's already reached an age where she has to put in more effort on her makeup. She can't be like those young women who are confident in their youth and just put on light makeup and comb their hair casually. So she always doesn't go out until nine or ten o'clock in the evening. We called her too early just now, so she couldn't come. This time is just the right time. Moreover, she already received a "局票" (invitation slip) earlier, so she will definitely come." Ren Peizhen said, "Then let's try again. I've long heard of her fame. She's a character in Chinese history. It would be good to talk to her."</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Gold Price Plummets</p>
<p>Rumors Abound</p>
<p>Atmosphere Turbid</p>
<p>Market Conditions Extremely Perilous Yesterday, January 12th, the gold market situation was extremely chaotic, fluctuating wildly and changing rapidly. The overall market difference was almost 200,000 taels, and the turmoil was extreme. In the end, it plummeted by 20 taels, causing extreme panic and disorientation among the people. Both official and unofficial exchange rates weakened, with the rate of rise slowing down. Banks experienced fewer outflows and more inflows. Trading was varied across the market. Yuan Maoyong, Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Yuan Cheng, and Fu Chang, among others, were net buyers, while Yi Feng Yong, Tai Kangrun, Zhen Changxiang, etc., were largely sellers. Overseas silver markets indicated rising trends in telegraphic reports the day before. Therefore, the gold market initially fell, but then buyers became active, gradually pushing prices upward, briefly exceeding 724 taels. However, due to unfavorable exchange rates and rumors of proposals to rescue plummeting silver prices abroad, the market turned weak and plummeted by 10 taels. The situation was chaotic and unpredictable. The market felt even more complicated, with sudden and violent fluctuations of several taels at a time. The atmosphere was turbulent due to the proliferation of rumors, with the on-again, off-again US loan negotiations causing widespread uncertainty. Subsequently, prices suddenly broke through 710 taels, and trading on the floor became erratic.</p>
<p>Rumors Fueled Disorder It was widely reported that the price of silver for February opening at 715.5 taels in the morning, fell 11.5 taels. (Gross margin fell from 20 to 14-15 taels, then rebounded to 18 taels, but was disorganized and erratic, (and trading was also varied.)) The large bills were all up 16/11, the silver price rose 7/8, private cables added 875. Later, Fu Chang, Yuan Heng, etc., followed up, so the price gradually rose by 5-6 taels, but there were often fluctuations of 2-3 taels. Exchange transactions were mainly sold by peers. Mitsui bought 136,875 worth of March British gold, and Hua Bi bought 137,500 worth of April, then priced it against silver at 75. At 9:20, the price of gold rose to 21.5 taels, and soon fell back 3.5 taels. When the initial quotation was announced, it was increased to 20 taels, which was actually due to the frequent entry and exit of various firms. The listed price of British gold was up 375, Citibank was up 75, Japanese gold was down a small fraction of 4, but the price of gold was still flat, only a little over one tael lower. Afterwards, Yuan Cheng, Fu Yu, Da Lian Bang, etc., bought in, and the internal price of British gold was still stable, so at 10:00 it rose to 724.8 taels. Banks priced 136,25 of February British gold, Mitsui absorbed 1.56 taels of spot from Dalian. Afterwards, the market suddenly turned weak, as Yi Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, and other firms came to sell. In half an hour, the price plummeted by 10 taels. At 10:40, it was 15 taels. Afterwards, the situation was chaotic, with gains and losses of 4-5 taels, amidst the storm, and it was unclear what was happening. At 11:15, it was 23 and rain, with HSBC absorbing 136,875 worth of March British gold, and Shanghai firms selling 625. Subsequently, there was still a 5-tael margin. After 11:30, Yuan Cheng suddenly sold, and the price fell to 17.5 taels. By the close of the market, it was 19.5 taels, and then fell slightly to just over 18 taels, as firms sold off. The quoted price was 760 taels and 0.02, with Japanese gold listed slightly lower by 4%. The amount was reduced from 40 taels to 25-26 taels, then reduced by a small amount of 45 taels, and at noon 41 taels.</p>
<p>The Aftermath of Rumor Mongering After the market opened, it was at 18.5 taels, with gross margins reaching around 20 taels. Due to large forward Indian exchange rates, it fell to 16.5 taels. HSBC and Zhengjin consumed 136,875 worth of March British gold, and Yuan Maoyong and others bought in, rising to 20 taels at 2:10. Then, rumors circulated that the Sino-US loan might be initiated somehow. Because British gold rebounded strongly, banks sold 138,125 worth of April, and the price of gold fell slightly by 2-3 taels. Then, Mitsui suddenly sold 8125 of February, and the selling trend on the floor was particularly strong. Wanxing, Shunli, and Da De Cheng all sold off, so the market fell sharply, reaching 708.5 taels at 3:20. Because Shanghai absorbed 875 of April British gold, Dehua and Mitsui mutually traded 875 of June, and Sumitomo absorbed 8125 of March, it suddenly jumped up by more than 4 taels, reaching 13 taels around 4:00. Firms seeking to cover their positions bought in. After 4:00, it remained in a weak state. Yuan Maoyong, Fu Chang, etc., sold off, and British gold weakened further. March could be settled at 8125, causing a drop of 7-8 taels. At 4:15, it was 705.5 taels, then rose by 2.5 taels. By the market close at 4:30, it was 706.8 taels, a further drop of 20.2 taels compared to the previous Saturday. In subsequent after-hours trading, Fu Chang, Yongheng, Yuan Maoyong, etc., continued to sell, causing a sharp fall to 703 taels, and then 705 taels. The market was unstable and unspeakable, like duckweed drifting with the wind.</p>
<p>Fluctuations of 15 Taels The maximum price for the day was 724.8 taels, and the minimum price was 705.5 taels (according to listed prices), a difference of 19.3 taels. The quoted price was reduced from 40 taels to 53-54 taels. Before and after the close, the market was settled twice.

<h3>Exchange Rates Revised Lower</h3>
<p>Domestic Rates Weak... Trading Lively</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rates for all currencies rose by 1.5 tiers, as overseas silver markets were trending upwards the day before.

The Japanese yen decreased by 4%, totaling 1.5775 taels. Domestic rates were also generally weak, and because the gold market had turned weak, it had fallen by a huge 20 taels, suddenly breaking through 710 taels, likely due to international news of a silver market bailout, causing widespread uncertainty. By the market close, compared to the previous Saturday, British gold was up 4375, the US dollar was up 9375, and the Japanese yen had fallen by more than 5%. Trading among Chinese merchants was still lively. Speculators such as Ying Mou, Yu Faxiang, and Cheng Feng Yong were all buying in. A total of 400,000 pounds of British gold was traded.

<h3>Discount Market: Tight and Slack Phenomena</h3>
<p>At the end of the year, the financial sector usually adopts a policy of contraction. Because account settlements and loan repayments were held in two phases last year, all year-end payments have not yet been settled. Therefore, the current situation remains the same as in previous years. Transactions between silver and money businesses continue to flow in and out, and must be settled after the Lunar New Year. This leads to a mixed situation of tightness and slack in the market. Western discounts seem to be falling again, while silver credit is very strong. Overdrafts feel quite tight. However, the market is not chaotic and there are no other unexpected changes.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Rise in Unison</h3>

The morning market traded over 8 million yuan, and the afternoon market was slightly quieter, trading over 4 million yuan, for a total of 12,165,000 yuan.

The early market in the afternoon was still firm, but began to weaken at the close, with a slight decrease in trading volume. As a result, only the 96 bonds fell slightly compared to the end of last week, while the whole six-month bonds rose by about 2 yuan, and other bonds also rose by 0.3-1 yuan each.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Markets: Softness with Underlying Firmness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market fell in the morning and flattened out at noon, but the overall trend remained firm. Although the demand for spot yarn in the market was flat, prices were very high. After a large number of transactions took place, the inventory of various factories decreased, and they did not seem inclined to lower prices. The mindsets of the Chao Gang and Japanese merchants remained unchanged. Some short sellers had already covered their positions, and there were also many manufacturers buying in to go long. However, the gold and tide issue could not be resolved for the time being, and the yarn market was still in a state of turbulence.</p>
<p>Man-Made Standard Fluctuates Three Times a Day The opening price of the Man-Made Standard in the early market was flat, with the lingering mood from the previous day still present. Near-month contracts fell by more than one or two taels, while far-month contracts fell by only 3.5 cents due to manufacturer purchases. The second and third rounds were flat. As a result, near-month contracts fell by 8 cents to one or two taels, and far-month contracts fell by 2.6 cents. The opening situation in the afternoon was quite strong, with large investors buying in. The closing price fell sharply because the price of gold trended down, and the market sentiment weakened again. Near-month contracts rose by 4, 8, and 6 cents, and far-month contracts rose by 2 and 3 cents. The total number of transactions for the day was 40,250 bales. Chang Feng bought 3,950 bales, Ji Feng bought 1,950 bales, Mao Ji bought 1,350 bales, and the rest bought 6-700 bales. Heng De bought 3,750 bales, Xin Cheng bought 1,900 bales, Rui Da bought 1,850 bales, Yi Chang bought 1,300 bales, and the rest bought 8-900 bales. The closing price of the Man-Made Standard is recorded below.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Restrained by Gold Standard</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly loose, because the gold prices declined and the market sentiment became relatively stable, bulls remain tough, the trend is still strong, but overseas cotton markets continued to sag, and it is difficult to persist. Because of the lack of supply from various routes, the real demand of each factory is increasing. With too fast of a price increase, there is no desire to purchase and the picture is one of weak sales. The future of the cotton market is hard to predict.</p>
<p>Han Standard Continues to Rise by 0.02-0.03 Yuan The market opening for the Han Standard in the morning. Because the market climate was poor the previous day, foreign cotton was generally tired and weak. The gold prices trended weak and fell back. As a result, the prices of the various months were flat. The statistics for the full day show 113,200 dan of transactions. Shenchang sold 5,000 dan, Deji sold 3,200 dan, Tianlong sold 3,800 dan, Shenji sold 3,100 dan and other entities sold 2-3,000 dan.

<h3>Food: River Downstream Rice Market - Southern Stability and Northern Firmness</h3>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, a few boats of inland rice arrived, but were still sparse. Sales from all directions were extremely active. There was little white glutinous rice of high quality, and the top price rose by 0.1 yuan, opening at 13.7 yuan. The special glutinous rice disk face was hovering around 14 yuan, with no major changes. The purchasing sentiment for thin rice was acceptable, and the price was close to rising by 0.1 yuan. There were few shipments and storage of mutton glutinous rice, and sales were average. Although the Du Township sharp cargo was declining, the sales market was not smooth. The general trend was that only high-quality goods rose by half a foot. There was no particularly high-quality rice from Bian Yuan. Ordinary high-quality rice from Gao Yuan was traded quite a bit, and the market price was rising beyond 0.1 yuan. Yin Yuan was stable and uneventful. High-quality goods opened at 12 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai South Yesterday, over ten boats arrived, and the market sentiment was weak. Regular glutinous rice was extremely scarce, and the top market price barely opened at 13 yuan or so. Ordinary machine glutinous rice such as Su Tong etc., were all fixed. The average and lower-quality ones need to be reduced by about 0.1 yuan, a bleak situation. South Gang green angle and other thin rice and early rice, had little arrival and sale, their prices remained flat, while central passes received small discounts, which was related to the sunny weather. The street retail of Mutton Du Sharp was acceptable, with slow arrivals, and stable trends. Besides the steady high-quality rice from Bian Chu Yuan, the remaining rice had a mediocre momentum.</p>
<h3>Guest Hsien Rice Continues to Improve</h3>
<p>Inland river sources decrease, street sales become the main outlet</p>
<p>Prices of Ji Wan rice and other varieties rise by a few cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for guest hsien rice was particularly favorable, showing an upward trend. This was due to the freezing of inland river channels, which reduced the supply of Du rice to the city. Moreover, the number of arriving boats had decreased recently, leading to a shift towards purchasing guest hsien rice. Yesterday, over two thousand packages of Jiangxi Ji Wan rice and two hundred packages of Ji Zao rice were selected and purchased. Buyers from Ningbo were also gradually becoming active. Four to five hundred packages of Hunan red rice and other varieties were also purchased on the market yesterday. The arrival of guest yuan rice was limited, and with the decrease in Du yuan rice supply, the market also showed an upward trend. Yesterday, buyers from Xiamen purchased around three hundred packages of Xiang-Gan Ji Yuan rice. The listed prices were: Jiangxi Ji Wan rice, eleven yuan and six cents to ten yuan and eight cents; Ji Zao rice, ten yuan and four cents; Ji Yuan rice, thirteen yuan; Hunan Ji Hong rice, ten yuan and two cents and six fen; Red rice, nine yuan and seven cents; Ji Yuan rice, twelve yuan; Nanjing Ji Yuan rice, ten yuan and five fen. All prices were a few cents higher than the previous market prices.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, all months experienced a sharp decline. The price of gold had fallen by nearly twenty to thirty taels from its peak, leading to a significant increase in exchange rates. Therefore, for the distant months, the short sellers, based on contracted wheat purchases, could still approach the actual price. For example, the combined price of Australian wheat was only about four qian, so selling pressure resumed smoothly, while the long positions retreated. The market was largely bearish. Looking at the future rise and fall, it will depend on the situation abroad. As a result, this month's price fell by six fen compared to the previous weekend, February fell by one qian, March fell by nine fen, April fell by one qian, May fell by seven fen, and the price of new wheat in June remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Sharp Decline in the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Surplus of foreign wheat...Gold price reversal...Short positions increased</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, all months experienced another sharp decline. Due to the surplus of wheat in England and the United States, they were entering a state of close competition, leading to negotiations for large loans to China. According to the rumored news, it is unlikely to become a reality. However, the surplus of wheat in the domestic market is an undeniable fact. Therefore, people's confidence suddenly weakened, and selling pressure increased. Furthermore, with the reversal of gold prices and a slight increase in interest rates, short sellers inevitably became more enthusiastic. Therefore, the overall market situation, shrouded in this atmosphere, once again moved towards a sharp decline. As a result, this month's price fell by three fen and two and a half li compared to the previous weekend, February fell by three fen and two and a half li, March and April fell by four fen, May fell by four fen and two and a half li, and June fell by three fen and seven and a half li.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Sales Flourish with 40,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Market prices slightly stabilized as a result...New green sugar rose by eight taels and two qian</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from the sugar market production areas regarding Cuban spot sugar and New York sugar futures. Java spot and futures prices remained unchanged. In the guild market, the buying interest for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse grain white was still strong. The initial asking price was higher, but as trading continued, the transaction price remained at one tael and six qian and a half. Cuban foreign sugar was nine taels and one qian, Dutch red sugar No. 8 was nine taels and one qian and a half. The market was still firm. Japanese sugar YT mark was ten taels and seven qian, Minghua goods were ten taels and seven qian to six qian and a half, YP mark was eleven taels, YRO mark was ten taels and two qian, Meiji goods were ten taels and two qian and a half, YP mark was eleven taels and one qian, J mark was eleven taels and two qian and a half. The market was relatively stable. The factory price for Dali sugar was four yuan and seven jiao, although a telegram had been sent, confirmation was still pending. Meiji goods for March delivery opened at 12,000 bags, priced at 4.6 yuan in Japanese gold plus tax. Minghua sugar for February delivery was 10,000 bags, priced at 6.7 yuan in Japanese gold including tax, which was very popular. Although Panjin Faji opened sales of 2,000 bags of coarse grain white spot goods, priced at 10 taels and six qian and a half. Deda Hao sold 48 bags of Xiamen ice flower green sugar, priced at 9 taels and 7 qian. The national goods, unified hand ice Kunyu brand, were priced at 7 taels and 7 qian, with only a few dozen boxes available. New green sugar opened briskly with over a thousand packages, and the price rose by eight taels and two qian. The market was also not weak. Huaxin Hao sold over a thousand qian of Dutch red spot goods, with No. 8 goods priced at 9 taels and 1 qian and a half, and No. 9 at 9 taels and 3 qian, and No. 10 goods at 9 taels and 4 qian. The goods were very mediocre, but demand was still high, so the market trend still felt firm.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Dried Longan and Golden Needles Continue to Rise in Price</h3>
<p>(Dried Longan) Due to recent lack of arrivals, sales have become more active, and the interest of various firms has intensified, so the market price has repeatedly increased. The previous evening, trading continued to rise again, with ordinary goods rising from 29 taels to 31 taels. Slightly inferior goods only fluctuated by a few qian. Gaozhuang opened at 47 taels. The future market has a tendency to tighten further. (Golden Needles) Currently, winter sales are brisk, and demand from Guangdong and Hong Kong is quite good. The previous batch of goods has been sold out, and various firms are adding supplies from Shanghai. The trading is exceptionally tight. Yesterday, another batch opened, priced at 25 taels and a half to 23 taels, exceeding the market price. Therefore, the selling price has also increased accordingly.</p>
<h3>Processors Decide to Increase the Price of Dried Longan</h3>
<p>Due to the recent decrease in arrivals of selected dried longan and the rumor of increased land prices and taxes, and the difficulty in making profits in the Shanghai market, the trade association convened a meeting of various firms yesterday to decide on a slight increase in prices to avoid losses. The market prices for each grade are listed below: Top grade 30 taels, Heavenly grade 22 taels, Tianhong 16 taels, Sales grade 12 taels, Regular grade 20 taels, Top baldy 32 taels, Baldy one 22 taels, Baldy baldy 17 taels, Bubble yuan 10 taels.</p>
<h3>Shanghai White Silk Steadil Rises in Price</h3>
<p>B Grade Highest Price Reaches One Thousand and Thirty Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai white silk market continued to rise gradually. European, American, and Japanese firms were actively purchasing and bidding up prices. However, manufacturers were reluctant to sell in large quantities due to the high cost of raw materials. Only Jardine and others purchased 200 packages of B-grade Shanghai white silk. The price was highest for goods purchased by Mitsui, reaching 1030 taels. This market trend may be influenced by the sharp rise in gold prices.</p>
<h3>Gongxi Green Tea Sales to Russia Become Brisk</h3>
<p>Recently, the tea market in Shanghai has been slightly active. The Russian Aid Society is continuing to purchase Gongxi green tea.

English and French merchants are also making scattered purchases of Zhenmei and Zhucha teas. The selling price is similar to before.

The tea market trend is still downward.</p>

Nine-pound Cat English was four taels and four qian and a half. Coarse twills all rose by five fen.</p>
<p>The price of Eastern and Western piece goods has been soaring.

Yesterday, buyers from Sichuan, Hubei, Changsha, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other regions made large purchases, leading to a sharp increase in the price of Eastern goods.

Santan opened at four qian, Lieyan at three qian, seven fen, and seven li and a half, Moganshan at three qian, seven fen, and two li and a half, Shuangtonglu at three qian and three fen and a half.

<p>The Lincoln Motor Company announced that it uses various special tests in its factory to ensure that the leather and decorative fabrics used in the car meet the fixed highest standards of Lincoln car manufacturing. The testing method uses light similar to sunlight and cold than ice, and a stronger tensile force than a famous breed to measure it. After testing, if it is found to be qualified, it will be used to manufacture Lincoln cars. The leather used in the car must be able to withstand climates colder than zero degrees without cracking. This type of leather can also have good performance in the northwestern states, where the weather is extremely cold. It must also undergo a strength test to determine its solid quality and durability. Various fabrics used to decorate the car are illuminated with intense purple light, so there is no risk of discoloration even in places with strong tropical sunlight. The texture must be uniform, and it is torn open with a powerful machine to explore whether it can withstand wear and tear. The springs used in the car body seat must also undergo the same rigorous testing as above to increase the comfort of riding. A machine with a 50-pound force bullet strikes 25,000 to 30,000 times to test its elasticity, whether it is sufficient to make the car durable and comfortable in the future.</p>
