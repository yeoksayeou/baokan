<p>（日内瓦）國聯理事會星期五會商之結果、雖以日本一票之反對、未能發生拘束力、但國聯中人深信全世界擁護理事會决議案、其道德上壓力、亦足以充分阻止滿案之深刻化、該决議案旣將一種道德的義務施諸日本、料日本當不能漠視不顧、此間觀察時局者多謂倘日軍未能</p>
<p>於十一月十六日撤盡、料中國或其他國家行將提出國聯會章第十五經或十六欵、該兩欵規定國聯所能施行之最大懲罰用經濟封鎖以裁制凶頑之會員、此次决議案雖因未獲得一致同意而失其約束效力、但日本未嘗不可重加考慮、而於三星期間切實履行案内撤兵條欵、故今夕議長白里安於表决之後、覩此向來所無之僵局、憤然置决議案於桌上宣稱、此案之行否、今已全在日政府之手矣、至國聯中人意見亦不一致、急進派以爲滿洲時局極爲嚴重、日軍駐在中國境土、違背國聯會章第十欵與非戰公約第二欵、今其强佔不撤、無異與國聯及非戰約簽字國公然相抗、日人旣用武力佔領、冀迫中國與彼開始談判、而給以種種讓與權、唯有英法美國等政府立加干涉、始能免起嚴重糾紛、理事會今次會議、可視爲和平解决方法已至山窮水盡之境、下次會議必須將國聯力量、予以最充分之表示、預料中國勢將根據會章第十五·十六·兩欵陳訴云云、穩健一派則以爲國聯如有峻切行動、反將招致中日間發生戰爭深信此次强硬之决議案、縱以日本異議不生拘束力、但較諸空調而一致之决議案已勝一籌、目下局勢雖有兩點令人不寗、（一）日軍仍駐滿洲中國境土内、（二）日本要求與中國直接外交談判、而其性質與用意秘不發表、但已有下列諸優點、（一）美國與理事會合作、（二）非戰公約業已運用、（三）辦理和平解决已有相當進展、希望將終見諸實施、如第三者監視員及設立中日永久調解委員會等是、（四）日本地位已明晰、（五）日本如不接受理事會調處、則居孤立地位、（六）滿鐵區域外之日軍逐見减少、（七）理事會中十三理事　同意日兵必須於十一月十六日撤盡、（八）全世界輿論喚起以助中日爭執之和平解决、（二十四日國民社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c20">十一月十六日以前 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>二十四日國聯行政會續開大會之結果。以十三票對一票。通過限定日本十一月十六日以前撤兵之决議案同時日政府對案亦以十三票對一票否决經一月有餘之焦思苦慮。勸誘斡旋。集議辯論。僅而得此一較爲具體堅定之决議案。吾人於屏息忍耐延頸企盼之際。聆此消息。實彌覺其可珍。蓋於此尙足以證明國聯對於擁護世界和平之重責。未肯遽然撤手也。</p>
<p>雖然。東北艱難之局勢。絶未以此一空洞之决議而遂獲得確有保障之開展也。前途暗礁重重。困難尙多。我國備受横暴之蹂躪。積一月餘來之呼籲與爭辯。僅而博得此一起碼限度之决議案。「公理常在於强權之門。」吾人固不容因此而稍存自慰之念。而且進一步言。例之日人公然違背上月三十日國聯限定日軍於本月十四日以前撤退之决議。證以日代表前在大會中倔强無誠意之態度與發言。日人是否肯遵照决議於十一月十六日以前全部撤退暴軍。已爲絶大疑問。况其今日二次聲明書之表示。與所謂基本原則五項之解釋。更顯然露其拒不履行之意。設使日本屆時而竟不撤兵。或且竟有進一步曢動作。國聯究準備如何應付。吾人姑置而勿論。至我國究將如何應付。則吾人在此時决不能不預爲籌謀故國聯决議限期撤退日軍。與其認爲緊張時局之將次結束。母甯認爲新的變化之醖釀與準備。在此新的醖釀變化之下。乃爲我國人最應努力之時。</p>
<p>在十一月十六日之前。國人之所應努力者爲何。吾人認爲</p>
<p>（一）應穩固中樞政局。一致主張。以作外交有力之後盾。外交情勢之轉變。常繫於我國内政局之安危。今日滬上會議合作。旣已微呈曙光。茲後當更精誠團結。督促此一線之曙光。日益光大。而勿復歸暗淡。俾國力增厚藉新國際之耳目。利外交之進行。</p>
<p>（二）應充實外交之機能。確定外交之方針我國外交。歷無方針。事迫臨頭。始籌應付。無與國無聯盟處於孤立無援之地位。在此次國聯會議中蓋可灼見。至於外交機能。亦極欠充實外交情勢緊急至此。而外交部長駐德公使駐法公使駐美公使均久日虚懸其將何以運用外交之手腕廣政府之耳目故今日應速樹立外交方針。速派定外交部長及駐在各公使。注意國際宣傳。喚起國際輿論</p>
<p>（三）應作最後之準備。前途暗礁尙多。局勢變化。正未可測。吾人前已言之。設使日人屆期而竟不撤兵。設使日人竟更有進一步之動作則第一步中日單獨正面之衝突。殆無可迴避。故我國此時。應充實國防。鞏固要塞集中實力。作萬一時期之最後準備。俾不至再蹈九月十八之覆轍。至於國聯會章之第十五六條。即令經我提出而各國能否同情實行。殊爲渺茫而不可必。故吾不能不自作準備而徒依賴國聯也。</p>

<p>（一）分工合作十六省水災之大、較民六河北一省爲廣、其辦理更爲棘手、民六河北水災、由政府特設督辦、付以全　、省長不過居於輔助地位、一切振費工費、均由中央籌撥、交通運輸、財關免稅、以及懲奬官吏、督辦皆有權能可以辦理、故其運用靈活、布施周密、數百萬災民、無有凍餓者、即此行政機關單獨制之能收效果也、今次各省水災、中央旣設水災救濟會各省又設分會、此合議制之不免於稽延、固爲迅速救振原則之障礙、而中央與各省權限莫明、事業不分、將來必有互相推諉、互相爭執、互相歸咎之弊、而嗷嗷待哺之災民、無形中空受其害矣、愚以爲中央地方、亟宜分别權限、劃明事業、凡關於重大工振、運輸振品、減免稅費、分配振欵、辦理平糶、勸募振捐籌劃方略、均由中央負責、凡關於散放冬春各振、修理官民各堤、以及一切　振均由地方負責、其有地方振工兩費不足者可由中央加以補助、但須由中央派員前往監視散放、以收實惠及民之效、民國六年京畿水災督辦處、即用此項辦法、因散放振欵、地方紳士與慈善團體、有桑梓情誼、宗敎思想之密切關係、較優於官吏、二則因災區過大、中央實無如許之人才、可以應用也、是也酌定折中辦法、督辦處提出振欵一百餘萬元、委託順直助振局散放冬振、又提出五十萬元委託直隸義振局散放春振、又提出九十萬元補助各項雜振、並由督辦處分派查振委員、隨同該局紳等前往災區、以審核災情之輕重、繼則分派監振委員、眼同監放、以查明振欵之有無流弊、而又恐以上兩委員之或有徇情怠職者、則呈請總統特派督察大員、以訪察所派委員之是否盡職、故督辦處雖經提放振欵二百四十餘萬元、實則並未直接經手一文之散放也、其次則爲河工、亦以當時人才缺乏、不得不沿用舊日河工人員之經騐熟手、而又恐其因沿積弊、故態復萌、胡於該河局呈送估工頇算表册之時、先派五大河籌勘宣防委員長、帶同各委員前往各河審查估工預算及應行堵築之需要、估算旣定、即行撥欵、復派監視工程與騐收工程之委員、以眼同監督其工程之是否核實無弊迨至伏秋搶險之時、又派監防委員赴工、以查各河委員之是否盡職、其有舞弊或不得力者、隨時嚴懲以儆效尤、故本年水勢雖復暴漲、而五大河得慶安瀾者、職　故也、然當時尙有一特點可紀者即督監各工之委員長、均爲軍人、隨同練習之佐員、均爲南方海河工程學校及山東工程局之學生、能耐勞苦、破除情面、較其他官吏爲盡責任也、此爲河北一省水災河工之已往經騐今災及於數省、尤應分别中央與地方權責、方可有分工合作之益、</p>
<p>（二）分任雜振十六省災區之廣大、災民之衆多、數倍於民六河北之一省、若專恃中央之財力人力實不足以應付、何况工振僅及於社丁、而老弱必致向隅、正振僅及於冬春、而生産尙須兼顧、民國六年河北一省水災、中央籌撥不過二百四十餘萬元、而各縣自力籌辦雜振各善團義振之數、亦達二百餘萬元、此則分任之效率也、舉其所辦、約有九項、</p>
<p>一曰平糶、水災之後糧商富室、不免　集增價極貧次貧者固賴振濟、中户可購糧食者亦爲所、困、故必須有平糶之舉、但災區旣廣、重在商人貪其昻價、多運糧食方能源源接濟、若專恃中央與地方之官爲平糶、非特無此供給全區之力量亦恐定價過廉、反阻商貨之來源、故此次平糶定價、只能較商貨稍低二文、防其抬高、而不杜其來貨也、故民六中央平糶糧石、雖規定爲五十萬石、其結果所運者不過八萬四千餘石、支出銀八十五萬八千餘元、而已市價皆平、此均由於定價稍廉、商貨多運之所致也、</p>
<p>二曰賑煤、水災之後、百草均經淹没、民間燃料實一問題、雖有振糧、若無燃料、亦難得食、南方多用木柴、貧民無錢何以購用、故此項亦不可少、民六河北除督辦處購運萬噸　曾由各煤鑛公司捐助數千噸、支配四十一縣、此次似應敦勸南北各煤鑛大公司、量力捐煤、以完此舉、</p>
<p>三曰貸欵、水災之後各市縣商埠小本工商、咸皆受困、若不設法援助將必至於失業、民六河北高陽保定實抵饒陽天津任邱肅寗蠡等八縣入民織布之家、居其多數、約計十萬餘户、每户平均五人、即有五十萬人、倘因被災而失業、不僅生産减少、即布機亦不可保、故督辦處向紡紗公司借給紗料一百萬元、交由布商轉發織户不取利息、遂將此十萬户生計、得以保全、次年紗價均經收回、政府方面、只耗利息數萬元、此次各省埠小本工商不在少數、應由中央商之上海各銀行團凑集巨額、組合一貸本銀行、按照上項辦法、當可救濟無數小本營業之人、以此次災區廣大、災民衆多計算、因水災而將所持各銀行鈔票、淹没損失者必不下午萬元、銀行　盡此義務、亦所當然、此外則因利局、亦可飭由各縣仿辦民六河北各縣、自集欵項、曾辦有三百零九處、於小本工商、不無裨益也、</p>
<p>四曰義當水災之後各鄉村小農、尤爲困苦、雖有　出數畝之田、而無力耕種何以爲生、必須設立義當使其不動産得以抵押、民六河北各縣成立者共有二十九處、又山西省歷逢荒災之年、由省府訂立章程、飭由各縣轉令其所住之村中富户、或不被災之鄰村富户、爲此不動産之抵押、秋收後按年歸還極有成效、華洋義賑會、曾在河北辦理信用合作社、爲互助貸欵之法亦可採行、（未完）</p>

<p>我國受外人經濟侵略。年逾十二萬元。憂國之士。莫不以提倡國貨相呼號。　廿年以還。成績殊鮮。外貨依然充斥。國貨依然不振。推原其故。殆以缺根本之辦法與方針耳。本社爰以此題。徵求國人竟見。計先後收到佳作。不下數百餘卷。茲擇尤發表。以供全國工商界之參考。本文所論。頗多見地。諸者可與昨日新聞報本社特刋所載吕吟聲君一文參閱之（編者附識）歐洲各國，自十九世紀以後，國内工業即長足進展，以致生産能力過　，産品供過於求，原料求過於供；資本之增殖，亦突過本國之容量，於是不得不掠奪殖民地，以獲得原料之供給；尋求海外市場，以銷售過賸之産品，更進一步，利用此種被征服之殖民地或市場，所産之豐富原料，與工資低廉之人工，從而經營各種企業，以流通國内過賸之資本，而壟斷當地之産業與金融，於是造成帝國主義的發展與侵略，我國地廣人衆，藴極富，且經濟落後，工商幼稚，具此數種資格之市場，正合帝國主義者之需要，故於一八四○年，英國首先乘鴉片戰爭之勝利，强迫訂立南京條約，其他列强，亦借故要求訂立種種不平等條約，自此我國門户洞開，列强藉不平等條約爲護符，挾砲艦政策之威力，大肆其經濟侵略之野心，近數年來，據海關報告：每年八超，常在十萬萬兩左右，至國内外商經營各種企業，所獲之利，亦不下十萬萬　，如此漏巵，遂致造成我國今日經濟破産，民窮財盡，盜匪遍地，災禍連年之險象，有識之士，莫不以提倡國貨，爲抵制經濟侵略，與救濟國家危亡之唯一良策，顧提倡國貨之根本辦法爲何？及應取如何方針？作者不敏，列舉數大端如左，願舉國上下，一心一德，共起圖之！</p>
<p>一，社會安定嘗考歐美各國，及東隣日本，其國勢富强之本，莫不建说産業發達，政治修明，兩大基礎之上，然建設此兩大基礎之先决條件，必爲社會安定，良以社會安定，爲建設之母，社會一安定，任何計劃，概可實現，否則，雖建設，亦徒勞耳，我國自前清末葉，以迄近年，國勢岌岌不可終日，内憂外患，迄無寗歲，此種現象，實社會不能安定有以致之，在此數十年中，國人對於各項事業，未嘗不謀發展，但成續如何？結果如何？往事俱在，不難覆按，是以欲安内攘外，當先謀所以安定社會之策，社會旣達於安定之域，則建設力量，易於充分發揮，産業之發展，國貨之振興，可計日而待矣，</p>
<p>二，不平等條約之廢除我國民生之所以如此凋蔽，産業之所以如此落後者，實受不平等條約之賜，帝國主義者藉此等條約，掠奪我原料，壟斷我市場：尤以「確定中國不得自由增加關稅」一條，使我國工商業，陷於萬刼不復之地，歐戰期内，列强無暇兼顧，我國工商業，一時頗呈昭蘇之象，但歐戰終了，列强又挾其雄厚之經濟而東來，以與我國對抗，結果匪特毫無進展，且慘遭失敗·此種失敗原因，當由於在華外商之壟斷，倘使社會安定，列强無所藉口，然後上下一心，努力於不平等條約之廢除，自屬易事，此種條約，旣經廢除，則外商失其憑藉，關稅由我自主，國内産業自能獨立發展，對外貿易亦可由我操縱，以我國地大物博，依照中山先生「迎頭趕上西洋文明」之辦法，行見我國産業之發展，將如長江一瀉千里之勢，民生問題，迎刄而解，豈祗提倡國貨已也，</p>
<p>三，富源之開發與交通之整頓一國工商業，固在無内亂外患二大環境之下而發達，而其進展，尤恃交通之便利，與原料之供給，二者相輔而行，苟缺其一，則工商業鮮有能充分發達者，日本若無東三省之煤鐵與糧食，則日本國防交通，以至各項事業，將受莫大打擊，英國若無印度之棉，與澳洲之羊毛，則英國紡織業，將全停頓，然二處之原料，若無四通八達之火車與輪船，爲之運輸，則其所受之影嚮，與無原料等，但謀交通便利，不若求原料供給之難，故在工商業發達之國家，交通無不便利，所慮者，原料不能自給耳，我國得天獨厚，工業上應需之原料，應有盡有，徒以交通梗阻，不能完全開發，平時所需，尙可仰給於人，設載釁一開，來源斷絶，豈非束手待斃？執筆至此，不寒而慄！國人不欲提倡國貨則已，否則，努力整頓交通，以開發富源，實爲刻不容緩之要圖，至交通如何整頓？富源如何開發？中山先生於實業計劃中，言之綦詳，無庸喋喋，</p>
<p>以上所述三大根本方策，絶非咄嗟可辦，必須國家實力充足後，方能次第實現，在國家實力未充以前，吾人提倡國貨，不能不準備下述應取而易行之方針，以爲將來發展之基礎，一訓練人才東西各國，工商業之商業之雇用人員，自小工店員，以至工程師總經理，無不具有相當之才能，以勝其任，此種才能，乃由平時訓練而成，故工商業，日有進步，而無止境，我國工商業之不能急起直追者，不在人才缺乏，而在人才之無訓練，緣固有之人才，往往用非所學，此類人才，對於所學荒疏旣久，一旦投身實際工作，欲其發揮所長，用於所任事業，因平時無相當訓練，祗有暗中摸索，遂致减少工作效率，如是欲望工商發展迅速，豈可得耶？故訓練人才，實爲發展我工商最先之準備，</p>
<p>二集中资本我國廠商之不能與外資廠商爭勝利，多由於資本太薄，規模過小·經濟能力旣屬不充，當然無大量之生産，與偉大之營業，其爲外資壓迫，自屬意中之事，故欲謀工商之發達，與國貨之振興，自不得不集中大量之資本，匪特可與外資抗衡；且大規模之生産，對於人工動力建築，以及他項費用，較之小規模者節省多多，此種辦法，頗適我國經濟情形，願亟起而行之，</p>
<p>三改良肸仿造國貨之不若外貨精巧者，非國人之腦力弱於外人也，特國人固步自封，未能利用科學方法，加以改良耳，年來國人，雖提倡國貨，不遺餘力，但對於貨品之改良，似無甚成績，即以絲茶而言，在二十年前，爲我國出口大宗，曾佔海外市場重要位置，因不知改良，相繼爲英日所排擠，其他如瓷器，絲綢，皆日就衰落，可勝浩嘆！挽救之策，惟有從事改良，方收提倡之效，至於非我國固有，而生活必需之物品，當積極仿造，數量方面，須力求自給自足，不再仰給於人，誠如是，漏巵可以减少，外貨可以抵制矣，</p>
<p>四奬勵與扶助任何事業，若不加以奬勵與扶助，斷難望其發榮滋長，工商業，又何獨不然，東西各國，對於本國工商業，奬勵與扶助，無微不至，如舉和地大規模博覽會也，遍設産業陳列館也，對外貨入口稅，無限制增加也，對國貨出口稅，努力减輕也，對於民營企業，予以經濟上，技術上之扶助也，對於外資廠商之限制，與壓迫無所不用其極也，凡此種種，皆爲對本國工商之保護政策，我國在不平等條約未能廢除以前，所述保護政策，固不能完全實行，我在在可能範圍以内，儘量奬勵，充分扶</p>

<p>助，使人民咸知發展産業之重要，養成恥用外貨之心理，持此方針，則國貨不難提倡矣，五工商信義「商人重利而輕義」，此昔時輕視商人之語也，證之今日商人中祗知圖利　顧信義者而益信，如勾結外商，將舶來品冐充土産者有之，挾股東之資本，經營投機事業者有之，不顧股東利益，祗求個人享樂者有之，出品稍得社會之信用，即攙雜劣質，以圖漁利者有之，是以因此而倒閉之廠商，不知凡幾，似此以　，不特工商信義掃地，國貨前途，亦大受影嚮，然因顧全信義，而致營業蒸蒸日上者，亦不乏其例，如中國化學工業社，三友實業社等之有二十年之歷史者，皆「誠實不欺」，有以致之，我國廠商欲其營業發達，而久遠者，對於工商信義，不可不三致意焉，</p>
<p>六勞資合作我國勞働問題，内容極爲複雜，處置稍一不愼，即引起莫大糾紛，年來勞资雙方，表面雖似和平，而成見實深，若不完滿解决，我國産業界，所受損失殊大，處此國運多艱，提倡國貨積極進行之際，勞資雙方應如何彼此諒解，互相携手，進而爲充妥之合作，謀産業之發展，則國勢之强盛，又何俟乎蓍龜，非裨益勞資雙方已也，</p>
<p>七實地考查閉門而造車，未必盡合天下之軌：方之以製貨，亦未必盡適各處之用，於是實地考查尙矣，考外貨之所以能投國人之好，而充斥我市場者，乃外人來華考查之結果也，我國土産在外之所以日漸衰落，在内幾全爲外貨所代者，是皆昧於考查之重要也，至今以往，欲對外發展土産，對内抵制外貨，必須派員實地考查，對社會情形，人民心理，以及所銷産品之質與量，均須作缜密之研究與統計，方可馳騁商塲，勝利可操，所謂知己知彼，百戰百勝者是也，</p>

<p>調味品的在我國，最先是日本的味　素，差不多國人腦筋中，是没一個不知道的，牠在中國市塲上，横行了二十年，我國錢錢的外溢，也不計其數，其後國内也先後創設工廠，製造此物，以謀抵制，其已有成效者，如中國化學工業社的觀音粉，根泰廠的和合粉，德豐廠的五味素，天廚廠的味精，天一廠的味母，都很有成績，但是說也可憐，這幾家廠雖努力了好許多年代，聲嘶力竭，的在提倡宣傳，以謀抵制外貨，然而僅有了現在些微的成績，但是他們的出品，尙還不能遍行全國，尤其東北幾省，一方固然是廠方的能力微薄，不能喚起國人注意，　一方面國人也難辭其不加提倡之咎！。不過亡羊補牢，猶爲未晚。現在正是大競爭的時代，深望廠方和國人速起注意，竭力提倡，羣起採購國貨。那勝利的左劵，畢竟還操在我們的手裏。</p>
<p>講到調味粉，乃係一種細粉質，色白味美，入水就能溶化，加入於一切菜蔬中，就可增加幾倍鮮味，在生活日高的現在，百物昻貴，魚肉菜蔬之類，當然不能例外，於是要解决飮食，節省經濟，那調味粉就應運而産生了，用了少許的調味粉，加入菜中，就能變成了鮮美絶倫的上菜，旣可增進食慾，又可解决經濟問題，眞是一舉二得，所以現在不論大小菜館，和上中下的住家，差不多没有一家不用此物，其已爲日用必不可省之物，毫無疑義了。</p>
<p>調味粉旣居國家生産地位上如此重要，那麽，當此稍有生色可望的調味粉，我們自不得不重視牠的前途。</p>
<p>溯自金貴以來，味　素的價格飛漲，在南方幾省，因爲國産調味粉價廉物美，勢力雄厚於是味　素大受影響，營業一落千丈。但日人狡獪異常，目擊我們國人都喜用國貨，若長此以往，味　素何堪立足，於是殫精竭慮的設法，另外發行幾種調味粉，如白鴿牌的味華，香菌牌的調味粉等，都冒充中國貨，大做廣告，以圖魚目混珠，而攪市面，但是，事出不意，被我國幾家調味粉廠，聯合登報否認，結果，紙老虎拆穿，仍難能在南方諸省逗留，於是他們不得不改變方向，從東北進行，利用其在東北諸省，南滿路附屬地的特殊勢力，以侵略一切，幸而國産如中國化學工業社的觀音粉，天一廠的味母等，因較早一步，在東北幾省銷額，早有非常成績，然國産調味粉的在東北，與日貨之競爭益烈！蓋日人認東北乃味　素等的根據地，臥榻之旁，豈容他人鼾睡？果然，味　素在奉天，已經計劃設廠製造，並大登廣告，大跌其價，新近在津，舉行了幾天遊行廣告，可說是聲勢浩大，其目的無非想把我國産調味粉一網打盡，其用計之深，可謂至矣。然而我們鑒於現狀之危，覺得事到其間，也顧不了許多。所以我個人主張際此短兵相接的時候，非併一個爾死我活不可。我們一面自己盡力的改進出品，設法跌價，一面還望國人要協助，宣傳提倡才好呢！（中國公學大學部）</p>

<p>我自從離開家鄉而來到杭州以後，不知不覺的已匆匆的過了七八個年頭了，最使我難捨而朝夕懷念不忘的是我的父母和我的妹妹，</p>
<p>妹妹，她的名字呌做英；模樣兒生得很惹人憐愛的，那時她已在我家附近的　　小學將快畢業了，她的唱歌和跳舞，平日功課的成績，全校只推她最好了·所以，她是很被親戚朋友們的稱贊呢。</p>
<p>新近我回家去，預先寫了一封信告訴他們我是在什麽時候可以到家了，父親剛剛有事出外未歸，母親她老人家呢，已經老早倚門把兒望了。當我下了車，從說不出來的喜悅和酸痛兩重情感交迫之下，很吃力的呌了一聲，一媽媽！」母親含着涙望着我微笑，我曉得母親看見她久離膝下的兒子一旦歸來，心境中當然有一種刺激的擾動。霎時，妹妹很快的從門裏跳將出來，仍舊像往昔小孩子樣的呌了我一聲「哥哥！」馬上拖着我的手朝裏面走，母親跟在我們的後面，照顧着車夫搬提着我的行李，···妹妹益發美麗了，身段的高矮却差不多趕上我了。」我坐着和母親閒談，妹妹坐在母親的身旁，聽我稱贊她的美麗時，她的兩頰上不由的飛上兩朶紅雲。</p>
<p>母親說：「英近來常閙着牙痛呢，她已經消瘦好多了，本來她的身體還更强健····」。</p>
<p>接着妹妹來不及的向我說，「是的啊！牙痛有時竟不能睡覺呢，我並且每天還算是很講究衞生要擦三次牙齒呢，哥哥，你看！我的牙是多少的黄得難看啊，有什麽辦法呢？」</p>
<p>「那末，你何不用三星牌牙膏呢？比普通的牙膏牙粉高明多多了，又是價廉，又是國貨，用了旣能使牙齒潔白，又可以使牙齒永遠消除疼痛和蛀壞的危險。」</p>
<p>妹妹照着我的話用三星牌牙膏不到幾天，牙痛也止了，牙色也白了，很快樂的跑來謝我·我道，「你何必謝我呢，你去謝謝中國化學工業社吧！你拿感激我的心還是去代爲多多的介紹吧·」</p>

<p>曁南史谷德西人會中半斤八兩之勁敵、在昨日雙方狀况中觀察、曁南實受不幸環境之支配、（一）守門温鼎新資質過人、記者可預斷其將來必成爲名家之一、然而自其開始而至成功、歷程之中、曁南不免因茲而得少許損失、爲將來計、亦値得也、（二）丘東炎大將風態、陳鎭和得力之同伴、體格未至健全之時休養爲上、否則反而貽誤大事、如昨日者、（三）羅海光用力不當、有過與不及之弊、與其任中錄不如改右内爲佳也、至當日曁南奪得兩球、咸自馮江兩内衞造成不過直接與間接之别耳當上半時曁南大兵壓臨敵門時、失機甚多、良覺憾事、史谷德初屆於人威、分守要隘、安心待時、一旦風來勢燄、全軍大唱進行曲、前後一致、無懈可擊、誠强敵也、</p>

<p>戰雲乍開、曁南領兵進擊、丘東炎踼來斜出、陳鎭和繼進、梅洪寳迫成角球、梅踼落門前、丘東炎頂之向前、羅海光反脚射門、相差尺許、陳鎭和再度光臨、丘東炎挾之進突窺自人羣中一脚、越過門柱而去、勇猛無匹之曁南、幾次進壓敵境、造成優美形勢、所憾事者、射門工夫欠佳耳</p>

<p>抗日之聲</p>
<p>— 才良</p>
<p>最近日本報纸上海日日新聞載着一個標題。說我們民衆所組織的「抗日救國會」是「强盜團」。我看了可恨亦復可笑。恨的是我們國家已經到了忍無可忍的地步。還不能同他們决一死戰。連我們民衆含恥忍辱所實行的「經濟絶交。」也要受旁人的譏諷謾駡。笑的是號稱强暴的日本人。怎麽對於我們非武力抵抗的不合作主義。也要加以村婦駡街的口吻。豈不是太没用了麽。所以照我看來。只要我們把抵制日貨的工作。認眞眞的幹下去。恐怕等不到幾年。一定要使倭人走頭無路咧。</p>

<p>科學該做養人保人的工具，不該做害人殺人的兇器。愛迪生在歐戰期内曾受美國政府之聘，從事特殊研究。愛迪生自說代政府幹了四十五種發明：據政府宣告只有三十九種，其餘六種是否秘密性質或是數目有错不得而知。但據這三十九種看來，多爲防敵避害之用。他創製種種防禦機械以圖制服德國之潛水艇，很像從前墨子抵制公輸般之雲梯一般。</p>
<p>據一九二三年六月二十四日紐約泰晤士報所披露，美國一國在愛迪生之發明和他的發明所引起之事業上所投的資本已有一百五十萬萬美金、（一五、○○○、○○○、○○○、元美金）約合華幣七百五十萬萬，差不多要等於自從哥侖布探獲美洲以及到現在所開採之純金之五分之一。</p>

<p>— 意園</p>
<p>廿年十月十八日。瀋陽慘案方週月。東亞戰雲醖釀中。國聯排解聲嘶竭。忽然噩耗又傳來。山岳崩頽舉世哀。人如可贖呼將伯。天胡不弔失奇才。稽考先生光耀史。俄州（Ｏbio）原是舊閭里。發明大家安迪生。宿昔才名遍遐邇。畢世勤劬在科學。不屑人間青與紫。遂能奮發獨爲雄。科學功成奪化工。聲光亦旣啓厥秘。電力爲用尤無窮。輓近各種交通器。賴公培植毛羽豐。若者凌空若着陸。神乎技矣無雷同。公享大年八十四。平生創作我奇異。自今北美電工塲。號召猶標芳姓字。（安迪生電廠全球知名）從來努力可回天。惟有潛心能治事。公恒以此詔其徒。願我國人無恝置。即今三島勢洶洶。制勝還須科學攻。驅車掃盡蚩尤霧。縱火廻將赤壁風。歎息吾儒太消歇。敎科今始發其蒙。憂時莫下新亭涙。把酒臨流一奠公。（却酬）</p>
<p>以好消息走告也。旣去。後迄不至。彼之來。初非有助於我也。徒欲使我勿輟學。藉以宣傳於世人。示東北之寗靖。冀掩其横暴也。狡哉日奴。</p>

<h3 id="c175">抵制仇貨聲中的一個好消息 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 何鵬飛</p>
<p>我國因爲受了暴日的欺凌。所以民衆激於愛國的熱心。就有抵制仇貨之舉動。在理論上講起來。這種舉動的確能夠制日人死命。但是我國對於仇貨也曾有過幾次的抵制。爲什麽並没有得到怎樣良好的效果。實際上不過使幾個奸商愈加養肥些罷了。這自然要歸罪於人民愛國熱之不能持久。和奸商的利令智昏的原故。但是根本上還是因爲有許多的物件。丨甚至連日常所用的日用品丨在我國還没有相當的替代品。即算有之。生産也少得很。實在是供不應求。加之抵貨組織的不完備。和奸人的破壞。所以無形中那仇貨又行銷市上了。說起來當然是一椿傷心而値得痛哭流涕的事。</p>
<p>但是在這裏我要舉出一個很淺近的例子來說。自從國産無敵牌等等的牙紛出世以後。日本的金鋼石牌牙粉在我國便絶了人跡。這豈不是可以證明上說的合理嗎。所以我認定消極的抵制是暫時的、無效的、不澈底的一回一事·如果眞要想澈底的永遠抵制。那就非得「努力生産」不可。根據十月十九日本報第十一頁特載欄所登載的文字。民國十八年的一年中仇貨輸入的總額。竟達三萬四千餘萬海關兩。其中以棉産物爲大宗。</p>

<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>光緒二二年（一八九六年）（一）六月十一日。日本迫我根據馬關條約訂立中日通商航行條約二十九經。日本除取得内河航行權等種種經濟上之利益。復取得在華領事裁判權。破壞我國法權之獨立。（二）北京草約。内容爲日本租界問題。</p>
<p>光緒二四年（一八九八年）中日北京條約。日本要求福建省及沿海一帶爲日本勢力範圍不得割讓與他國。</p>
<p>光緒二六年（一九○○年）我國拳匪肇事後。日本最先向大沽出兵。復會合各國聯軍。陷我天津·北京。</p>
<p>光緒二七年（一九○一年）辛丑條約成立。我國允償損失海關銀四萬五千萬兩。其中日本得三千四百七十九萬三千一百兩。並劃定公使館區域。取得駐兵權。</p>
<p>光緒二八年（一九○三年）日與英締同盟條約。以擁護兩國在中國之一切利益。</p>
<p>光緒二九年（一九○三年）中日增訂通商行船條約。續一八九六年之中日通商航行條約。</p>
<p>光緒三○年（一九○四年）日俄戰爭。旣以我土爲戰場。俄戰敗後。日本所得利益。又轉取我國。以俄國在華一切旣得權利。讓與日本。</p>
<p>光緒三一年（一九○五年）日俄戰爭告終。日本即迫我國訂立中日滿洲善後協約。逼我承認朴資茅斯條約中俄國讓與日本之一切權利。並開奉天省之鳳凰城·遼陽·新民屯·鐵嶺·通江子·法門庫。吉林省之長春·吉林·哈爾濱·寗古塔·琿春·三姓。黑龍江省之齊齊哈爾·海拉爾·愛琿·滿洲里等十七處爲商埠。及在營口·安東·奉天府各商埠劃定日本租界。並其他各種利益。</p>
<p>光緒三二年（一九○六年）（一）五月間。日本在滿洲設立鐵道株式會社。開始在滿洲實行經濟侵略。（二）七月間。日本在滿洲設立關東州都督府。及關東軍司令部。樹政治與武力侵略之基礎。（三）中日支收營口條欵。</p>
<p>棉紗　　　五、八四三、○○○　海關兩　一、七二％</p>
<p>合計　一一七、八一一、○○○　海關兩三四、六二％</p>
<p>所以棉産物地位的重要。就可想而知。我們又另將歷年海關的進口報告比較起來。近年粗支紗和粗布進口的數量漸次大減而特减。這就是近年以來國産粗支紗和粗布已有相當生産數量的原故。自然這是中國紡織業者一番苦心的結晶。値得我們的欽佩。並且我相信這也是我國工業史上最光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>最近英國報載上曾發表過目前的蘭開夏的棉業廠家。曾接到中國方面很多的定單。這顯然是證明目前的英貨要取日貨在中國的地位而代之了。自然這也是一垂飲鴆止渴拒狼迎虎的方法。不過我們也就可以看到我國目前對於棉産物需要之亟了。</p>
<p>現在有一個很好的消息。可以稍慰我們愛國的民衆。國民政府已有向英借欵購買紡織漂染機器的成議了。買來的機器。交由廠商自辦。借欵分項還清。據說這也是我國紡織業鉅子請求而得之結果。我認定這一着雖然不能使暴日的紡織工業完全崩潰。至少也要毁壞它的一大部分勢力。所以我希望直接和間接的關係者。都儘力來盡些責任擁護它。贊助它指導它。那末、先總理民生主義中第一要素的衣被問題。就再也不要仰給外人的鼻息了。人定可以勝天。大家都起來努力吧。（移酬助賑）</p>
<p>短訊安哈婷主演之「空谷蘭馨」。已在南京人戲院開映。該片情　根據膾炙人口之說部。其譯本已遍傳世界。即我國亦有之。片述一女子婚後之悲哀史。磨折苦楚。受外界之誘惑而被逐。備受世道之痛苦。哈婷表演。一舉一動。悽馨哀艶。足令人泣下云。</p>

<p>— 皖熙福堂女荷</p>
<p>自東省案發生之後、我們學校内佈滿了痛憤的空氣、恨不得立刻將那些强暴無理的矮奴驅逐出境、無論上課或休息的時候、没有一人不記得這次的國恥、、各大學都停課了、他們出去宣傳呀演講呀、請願呀、眞是忙得廢寢忘餐、我們雖然没有停課、但同時不得不也做點工作、所以由本校高中三學生發起、召集全體同學、請他們在課餘之暇、寫點標語、畫點漫畫、和宣傳事實給男女校役聽、但在工作之中、我們都保　守着兩句話、就是「救國不忘讀書、讀書不忘救國」、</p>
<p>自從標語和漫畫貼出之後、有幾位外國敎師似乎不贊成這種舉動、有時彼此說恐怕要成功Ｍobspjrjt吧、但我們的功課、從未懈怠、她們也就無可如何了、國際學生聯盟會、我們學校是加入的、例規呈每月開會一次、聚會的日子到了、當然有信來通知我們、但在國難的時期、誰還有興去作樂呢、所以會長先生去告訴顧問員了、</p>
<p>「克先生、今天我們不去赴國際學生聯盟會了、因爲校内有别的事、」會長向着一個外國敎員這樣說、</p>
<p>「什麽、你們不去赴會嗎、中國人的精神太没有了、所以你們的國家會到這種地步啊、」克先生有點怒意而帶着諷刺　口吻向她說、</p>
<p>她的臉漲紅了、眼涙也幾乎要吊出來了、但她極力的鎭靜着、兩眼的目光、直射到好這時所謂仇人的臉上、惡狠狠的回答說、</p>
<p>「請問克先生、如果貴國也在被難的時候、你仍有興去快活嗎、」</p>
<p>克先生惱羞成怒、她憤憤地大聲說、「無論怎樣、至少要去十人、」</p>
<p>涙珠兒一串一串的由會長眼睛内流下、眞無法可想了、於是她臨時召了一個緊急大會、</p>
<p>「諸位、我想不到、我國現在尙未亡國、而外國人竟以我們當亡國奴看待了、今天克先生的命令、非有十人去赴會不可」、</p>
<p>「一定不去、看她怎樣、大不了吵到校長那裏去、可是我們很有理、誰怕她呢、難道校長也不分黑白的嗎、」平這樣站起來憤憤的說、</p>
<p>「是的、我同平一樣的意思、」昭附着平的話說、</p>

<p>自從文學革命以後、中國的文壇似乎有一日千里之勢了、在創作方面、無論詩歌小說或戲劇、都不能不說有相當的成績、尤其是小說、眞很可以拿出一些很好的成績來、這是大家都不能否認的、但是關於文學理論方面的書籍却很使人失望了、是不是大家都感到文學理論的不需要、還是覺得這部工作的困難呢、自然、文學理論是一種極需要的東西、這是現今研究文學的人都漸次感到的了、但爲什麽對於這部工作很少人做、自然是大家都感到這部工作的棘手、因爲要幹這種工作、假使没有相當的研究、簡直就無從着手、不是像創作可以拿起筆來就寫好壞總可以寫一點的、所以關於這類著作很少、就是有的也祗是東抄西襲、東拉一點、西拉一點的的毫無系統的亂編一頓、何嘗有什麽研究和見解、又何能稱著作呢、</p>

<p>Adjourned Until the 16th of Next Month</p>
<p>Even if the Resolution Has No Legal Value</p>
<p>Moral Force is Sufficient to Sanction Violent Japan</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council reconvened at 6:05 PM today. Those eager to know the results of the final meeting gathered at the venue early. Each member present had a worried expression. Briand leafed through documents, Madariaga bowed his head as if lost in thought, and Shi Zhaoji entered carrying a leather case, with a slight smile. Today's second meeting was repeatedly delayed, partly because the clauses and levels of the Administrative Council's draft needed slight revisions. After the meeting began, Briand stated that talks had continued after this morning's meeting, hoping to find a solution. He had hoped that a mutually agreeable approach could be proposed, but contrary to expectations, the Administrative Council had two proposed texts, one being the Administrative Council's proposal and the other Japan's counter-proposal. However, the results of the prior talks could not be considered to have worsened the situation. The Japanese side showed a new willingness to consider the Administrative Council's views, but the Japanese representative was far from his country and unable to translate his instructions as he wished. Therefore, the Administrative Council had two proposals. Yoshizawa read a lengthy statement, detailing Japan's attitude and summarizing his previous points, consistently stating that the Japanese government must be responsible for its people. The chairman then first presented Japan's counter-proposal for voting, using a show of hands. Only Japan voted in favor. The chairman then presented the Administrative Council's resolution, which was supported by China, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Peru, Poland, the Irish Free State, Panama, Guatemala, Yugoslavia, and Norway, thirteen countries in total, with only Japan opposing it. Therefore, the Administrative Council's resolution passed by a vote of thirteen to one, as the basis for resolving the Manchurian Incident. Although this case has no legal value, French Foreign Minister Briand solemnly declared that this case has moral value and will permanently remain on the Administrative Council's record as the opinion of thirteen to one among the fourteen members of the Administrative Council. After the vote, members spoke one after another. Briand said that at this solemn moment, the Japanese government had expressed through its representative that it had no intention of using violence to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. He was fully aware of Japan's peaceful intentions and hoped that Japan would resolve the issue peacefully following this policy. He hoped that at the next meeting of the Administrative Council, he could report good news to the members. Before the meeting, if any member received news regarding this matter, it could be submitted to the Administrative Council. He expressed his warmest and most sincere thanks to the United States for its cooperation in this matter. Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Shi stated that Japan still insisted on direct negotiations first, refused to withdraw its troops, and refused to conclude a satisfactory plan for compensating the losses suffered by the Chinese in Manchuria since September 18 under the supervision of the League of Nations. He feared that the situation might not improve much. He believed that it was too long to delay the League of Nations meeting until November 16. China reserved the right to request an early meeting if Japan's troop withdrawal did not proceed satisfactorily. British representative Cecil praised Briand's work in achieving this result. Yoshizawa also praised Briand's wisdom and impartiality. Dr. Shi continued, saying that one of the most important issues in recent years had Briand's participation in its resolution, which was a good omen for the Administrative Council to succeed in the current dispute. He also sincerely admired the United States and said that he always hoped to resolve this matter satisfactorily with Japan. Briand delivered a speech in response, saying, "While there is still breath, I will work hard for peace." Briand finally asked the Chinese and Japanese representatives, who had expressed goodwill in the discussions, to persuade their respective governments not to take actions that would aggravate the situation and hoped that the difficult situation could be eliminated by November 16. Spanish representative Madariaga said that he hoped the United States' cooperation would continue. U.S. representative Gilbert rose and delivered a speech, thanking the speakers for their words of thanks to the United States. At this point, the League of Nations Administrative Council adjourned until November 16, but could be convened earlier in case of emergency. As for the Asian situation, it depends on what developments occur from today until November 16. The next Administrative Council meeting will likely be held in Paris, but it has not yet been confirmed. It is said that before today's second meeting, Briand and Yoshizawa had met for two hours, but to no avail. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the League of Nations Council's consultation on Friday failed to have a binding force due to Japan's single dissenting vote, League of Nations insiders firmly believe that the world supports the Council's resolution, and its moral pressure is sufficient to fully prevent the Manchurian case from deepening. The resolution has placed a kind of moral obligation on Japan, and it is expected that Japan will not be able to ignore it. Observers here mostly say that if the Japanese army fails to withdraw completely by November 16, China or other countries will likely submit Article 15 or 16 of the League of Nations Charter. The two articles stipulate the greatest punishment the League of Nations can impose: economic blockade to restrain recalcitrant members. Although this resolution lost its binding effect due to not obtaining unanimous agreement, Japan may as well reconsider it and earnestly fulfill the terms of the troop withdrawal plan within the three-week period. Therefore, this evening, Chairman Briand, after witnessing this unprecedented stalemate, angrily placed the resolution on the table and declared, "Whether this case proceeds or not now rests entirely in the hands of the Japanese government." The opinions of those within the League of Nations are also inconsistent. The radical faction believes that the Manchurian situation is extremely serious. The Japanese army's stationing in Chinese territory violates Article 10 of the League of Nations Charter and Article 2 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Now their forcible occupation without withdrawal is tantamount to openly confronting the League of Nations and the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Japanese have used force to occupy, hoping to force China to start negotiations with them and grant them various concessions. Only the governments of Britain, France, and the United States can intervene immediately to avoid serious disputes. The Council's meeting this time can be seen as the point where peaceful solutions have reached a dead end. The next meeting must fully express the power of the League of Nations. It is expected that China will file a complaint based on Articles 15 and 16 of the Charter. The more moderate faction believes that if the League of Nations takes drastic action, it will instead provoke war between China and Japan. They firmly believe that this strong resolution, even if it does not have binding force due to Japan's dissent, is better than an empty and unanimous resolution. Although the current situation has two points that are worrying: (1) The Japanese army is still stationed in Manchuria, inside Chinese territory; (2) Japan demands direct diplomatic negotiations with China, and its nature and intentions are kept secret. However, it already has the following advantages: (1) The United States is cooperating with the Council; (2) The Kellogg-Briand Pact has already been used; (3) Considerable progress has been made in handling peaceful solutions, hoping that they will eventually be implemented, such as third-party monitors and the establishment of a permanent Sino-Japanese conciliation committee; (4) Japan's position has been clarified; (5) If Japan does not accept the Council's mediation, it will be isolated; (6) The Japanese army outside the South Manchurian Railway area is gradually decreasing; (7) Thirteen council members agree that Japanese troops must withdraw completely by November 16; (8) Worldwide public opinion is awakened to help the peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. (National News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Executive Yuan's final efforts to achieve unanimous agreement, in order to establish a compromise solution, have come to nothing. Briand said as much at the beginning of the meeting. The final result is self-evident. During the vote, Japan's counter-proposal was rejected by a vote of thirteen to one. As for the Executive Yuan's resolution, it passed unanimously except for Yoshizawa. In this situation, the Executive Yuan's resolution has only become a strict recommendation from Geneva to Tokyo, with no other achievements to speak of. However, members criticized the final result, mostly saying that Yoshizawa's verbally expressed promise might lead to a better outcome. Briand, in his closing remarks, also repeated the Japanese representative's clear declaration and regarded it as a promise of a swift troop withdrawal. Briand said, "Our goal has been achieved, because the Sino-Japanese dispute has been severely restricted, so that it will not expand. Although we have now postponed the meeting, we have obtained a document, and the Japanese representative also has a copy in his hands." The chairman also said, "At one time, we were very far from our goal. Today, we have passed a clause sufficient to clearly express the opinion of the international court of public opinion." As for the current situation, Briand also explained, "The resolution passed on September 30 is still valid. The parties involved should inform the Executive Yuan of the situation, and the representatives of the countries in the Executive Yuan should also submit reports on the information obtained by their respective consuls stationed in Manchuria." The Chinese representative has doubts about whether these measures are perfect. It is said that as long as Japanese troops occupy for one day, there is no hope for improvement for one day. In any case, China cannot start negotiations until the Japanese army withdraws, and it will demand compensation for the damage it has suffered due to the Japanese army's attacks. Dr. Shi believes that the date of the Executive Yuan's next meeting, November 16, is too far away and immediately reserved the right to request an earlier meeting. The Japanese representative responded to this with the same general remarks he made at the beginning, saying, "Troops must be withdrawn only after maintaining security, and security depends on the stability of people's hearts, which cannot be achieved by the protection methods stated in the resolution. Only direct negotiations can solve everything." The claims of both sides are so far apart that the Sino-Japanese dispute may not be resolved for an indefinite period. However, people in Geneva do not think so, meaning that the Japanese government's political views are still wise and will eventually realize the truth. Yoshizawa's statement that Japan has no intention of waging war and that the danger of war has been eliminated is indeed a fact. Even Japan's repeated solemn declarations expressing good faith have been solemnly recorded by the Executive Yuan. In short, the Sino-Japanese dispute has already aroused world public opinion and made it pay attention. The pressure exerted by the Executive Yuan's resolution in spirit will not be without effect. Briand, after receiving enthusiastic praise from his colleagues, responded with a few words, saying that whether a solution can be established depends on the actions of China and Japan, and that the best way for the League of Nations' decision to take full effect is to reconcile national sentiments and guide their thoughts to tend towards international cooperation.

<p>Many plan to depart from here starting tonight. Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Shi Zhaoji expressed his opinion to reporters, saying, "I am very grateful for the Council's passage of the resolution and the rejection of Japan's counter-proposal. I firmly believe that if China restores its sovereignty in Manchuria, it will be able to provide Japan with any guarantees it requires. China is even willing to have the entire incident monitored by neutral countries, but China is determined not to sign an alliance under duress. We wish to live in peace and are even more willing to get along with our neighbor Japan. We hope that Japan will fulfill its promise to withdraw troops and even more hope that China can begin negotiations with Japan in a friendly spirit within the scope of the rights stipulated in the League of Nations Charter on October 16." Japanese Chief Representative Yoshizawa, after struggling hard for two weeks, feels exhausted. Today, he also made a statement to reporters, saying, "I hope that when the Council reconvenes on November 16, there will be a solution to the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Incident. Japan has always been loyal to the League of Nations and will continue to be so in the future. We hope that the Council will see the resolution of the Manchurian case at its next meeting. What I can tell you now is that there will be no war in Manchuria. Foreign Minister Briand, in the final minutes before the Council meeting this afternoon, was still painstakingly seeking a solution with me. However, my government's instructions firmly state that there must be guarantees for the safety of the lives of Japanese residents before the withdrawal of troops, because the Chinese in Japan receive all kinds of protection, while the Japanese in China have no protection. (?) Today is one of the most painful days of my life. I cannot name it, call it a great tragedy. Now I can only admire Mr. Briand and his method of handling the meeting in his capacity as Chairman of the Council, but we still believe that idealists do not understand the facts of the Manchurian problem. The Manchurian problem is a factual problem, not a theoretical problem. The sentiment regarding the United States' participation in the Council has eased, which is gratifying. My government is familiar with the overall situation in Manchuria, so it insists on adhering to the basic principles to protect Japan's rights." (National News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japan's True Intentions Revealed: The Content of the So-Called Basic Principles is as Follows <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday (24th) morning, British representative to the League of Nations Cecil and Chairman Briand questioned Ambassador Yoshizawa about Japan's troop withdrawal conditions, claiming that the so-called basic principles were being adhered to. What exactly is the content and nature of these principles? Yoshizawa's avoidance of answering led to suspicions among various countries. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement:</p>
<p>There is nothing that cannot be made public about the five basic principles required by our country. The so-called five basic principles are: (1) China's anti-Japanese hostile actions such as boycotting Japanese goods must be permanently stopped; (2) Existing treaties must be respected. The above two principles are the main body. (3) Confirmation of territorial integrity; (4) Prohibition of anti-Japanese education, etc.; (5) Ensuring the freedom of residence and business of Japanese residents in Manchuria, and land use rights. The above five items are legal under treaty law and international law. (Dentsu News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Government Plans to Issue Second Statement <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At 2:00 PM today, the government convened an extraordinary cabinet meeting, with all cabinet members from the Prime Minister down in attendance. First, Foreign Minister Shidehara reported on the progress of the League of Nations Council, and they discussed the policy for dealing with the League. As a result of the discussion, they decided to proceed vigorously according to the established policy and planned to issue a second statement on the China issue. After Foreign Minister Shidehara drafted it, it would be passed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting and formally issued. The content of the statement is roughly as follows: (1) The Manchurian Incident was provoked by China's illegal actions, so China should bear full responsibility; (1) The League of Nations Council lacks a proper understanding of the Manchurian Incident, so the resolution for troop withdrawal within a limited time is impossible in terms of the actual situation in Manchuria. Japan respects the spirit of the Council's resolution of September 3 and hopes for a peaceful resolution of the incident (2) The stationing of troops outside the railway-affiliated areas is purely a measure of self-defense to guarantee the occupation, with absolutely no territorial ambitions (1) Before the withdrawal of troops, the basic five principles for confirming the safety guarantee of the vested rights and interests of Japanese people in Manchuria are required (1) In order to resolve the various pending issues between China and Japan as soon as possible and restore friendly relations between the two countries, it is hoped that direct negotiations with the Nanjing government will be held as soon as possible (Dentsu News Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>Inquire About Opinions on the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Lindley and French Ambassador de Martel visited Foreign Minister Shidehara one after the other yesterday afternoon, stating that the resolution of the League of Nations Council was based on the urgency of the situation and was the most appropriate measure, and they hoped that Japan would accept it. At that time, Foreign Minister Shidehara explained in detail his intention to oppose it, saying that the Council's resolution for troop withdrawal within a limited time, which contained a warning, violated diplomatic conventions and ignored his country's representative. For example, in the three proposals of League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, his government had instructed Ambassador Yoshizawa to propose amendments, but the Council disregarded his government's requests and forcibly held the meeting, which was the most illegal attitude. His government would never yield. The two ambassadors left at dusk. (Dentsu News Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e20">Before November 16th <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The outcome of the League of Nations Council meeting on the 24th was a resolution passed by a vote of thirteen to one, stipulating that Japan withdraw its troops before November 16th. At the same time, the Japanese government's counter-proposal was rejected by a vote of thirteen to one. After more than a month of anxious consideration, persuasion, mediation, collective discussion, and debate, this relatively concrete and firm resolution was finally obtained. We, who have been holding our breath, enduring patiently, and eagerly anticipating, feel it is truly precious upon hearing this news. For it still sufficiently proves that the League of Nations has not hastily abandoned its grave responsibility to uphold world peace.</p>
<p>However, the difficult situation in the Northeast has by no means achieved a truly secure development solely through this empty resolution. Many hidden reefs and difficulties lie ahead. Our country, which has been subjected to brutal trampling, has only managed to obtain this minimal resolution after more than a month of appeals and debates. "Justice often resides at the gate of power." We must not allow ourselves to feel complacent because of this. Moreover, to go a step further, the example of the Japanese openly violating the League of Nations' resolution of the 30th of last month, which stipulated that the Japanese army withdraw before the 14th of this month, coupled with the Japanese representatives' stubborn and insincere attitude and speeches at the General Assembly, has already raised significant doubts as to whether the Japanese will be willing to abide by the resolution and completely withdraw their violent troops before November 16th. Furthermore, the expression in their second statement today, and the explanation of the so-called five basic principles, even more clearly reveal their intention to refuse to comply. If Japan does not withdraw its troops by then, or even takes further aggressive actions, what the League of Nations plans to do to deal with it, we will leave aside for the moment. As for how our country will deal with it, we cannot help but make preparations in advance at this time. Therefore, we should regard the League of Nations' resolution to set a deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops not so much as the imminent end of a tense situation, but rather as the brewing and preparation for new changes. Under these new brewing changes, now is the time when our countrymen should exert the most effort.</p>
<p>What should the Chinese people strive for before November 16th? We believe:</p>
<p>(1) We should stabilize the central political situation and have a unified stance to serve as a strong backing for diplomacy. Changes in the diplomatic situation are often tied to the stability and security of our domestic political situation. Today, the cooperation in the Shanghai meetings has already shown a glimmer of dawn. From now on, we should be even more sincere and united, and urge this glimmer of dawn to become increasingly brighter, and not return to darkness. Thus, the strength of the nation will increase, and the world will hear and see anew, which will benefit the progress of diplomacy.</p>
<p>(2) We should strengthen the function of diplomacy and determine the direction of diplomacy. Our country's diplomacy has historically lacked direction. Only when things are imminent do we begin to prepare a response. We have no allies and are in a position of isolation and helplessness. This was clearly evident in the recent League of Nations meetings. As for diplomatic function, it is also extremely lacking. The diplomatic situation is so urgent, yet the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Ambassador to Germany, the Ambassador to France, and the Ambassador to the United States have all been vacant for a long time. How can we use diplomatic means to broaden the government's ears and eyes? Therefore, today we should quickly establish a diplomatic policy, quickly appoint a Minister of Foreign Affairs and ambassadors to various countries, pay attention to international propaganda, and arouse international public opinion.</p>
<p>(3) We should make final preparations. Many hidden reefs still lie ahead. Changes in the situation are unpredictable. As we have said before, if the Japanese do not withdraw their troops by the deadline, if the Japanese take further action, then the first step, a separate and direct conflict between China and Japan, will be unavoidable. Therefore, at this time, our country should strengthen national defense, consolidate fortresses, concentrate our strength, and make final preparations for any eventuality, so as not to repeat the mistakes of September 18th. As for Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, even if we propose them, whether various countries can sympathize with and implement them is very uncertain and cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, we cannot but make our own preparations and rely solely on the League of Nations.</p>

<p>(Peiping) An English newspaper reports Deputy Commander Zhang's remarks, stating that Tokyo's plan is that the Japanese side insists on the claim that before withdrawing its troops, its five basic conditions must be recognized, but this has not yet been verified. The Japanese representative has not yet submitted these five conditions to the League of Nations. Regarding the issue of various mass organizations in the Northeast and the Shanghai Student Union requesting the restoration of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations, this is an extremely complex and important issue. Due to my position, I cannot express my opinion and will listen to the Central Government's resolution. Semenov, instigated by the Japanese side, is leading White Russians to engage in disruptive activities in the Eastern Provinces. In the current state of panic, this cannot be considered extremely serious. We have not yet received an official report on this matter. Recently, there have been rumors of Russian troops and cavalry crossing the Manchurian border. Although we have received reports from Manchuria Station, Suifenhe, Heihe, and other border areas from time to time, we have not yet received news of Russian troops crossing the Manchurian border. China is a member of the League of Nations. The Chinese government has decided to submit the panic caused by the Japanese army's invasion of the Eastern Provinces to the League of Nations for resolution. The claim about Chinese troops concentrating in Shanhaiguan is entirely a fabrication by the Japanese side. A formal gendarmerie has already been established there. I have no intention of going to Nanjing for the time being. (25th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>London, this morning's Observer commented on the handling of the Manchurian case in Geneva, posing the question with a sense of discouragement: Will Japan, or China, or both China and Japan withdraw from the League of Nations before November 16th? The newspaper said that there is still a disturbing situation in the current situation, that is, many important people in Geneva are considering whether it is appropriate to gamble the survival of the League of Nations by immediately adopting Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant to control Japan. This idea makes pragmatists feel uneasy, because at most this move will only cause Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations and destroy the purpose of the disarmament conference, unless economic sanctions can force Japan to withdraw its troops from Manchuria, but this is not necessarily certain. It is stated that Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that when member states of the League of Nations encounter disputes that cannot be resolved by other means, they have the right to take any actions they deem necessary to maintain public justice.

<p>(Paris) The newspapers expressed deep regret regarding the attitude taken by Japan in the Administrative Council, but still hoped to obtain a mediation method. "Le Temps" used a large headline saying that Japan failed to be persistent and that the Administrative Council opposed it unanimously.

"Le Journal" said that world opinion was already dissatisfied, and Japan's violation of obligations and international law would have an extremely bad impact. Does the Japanese government also know that it is wrong and express trust in the League of Nations? (25th Day Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Economic Cooperation Achieves Some Methods</p>
<p>Political Opinions Are Still Not Close</p>
<p>The Kuomin News Agency's Washington telegram on the 24th stated that French Prime Minister Laval declared today that the progress he had made in talks with American President Hoover and key figures in the American government had made him very pleased. He was particularly pleased that American Senator Borah had admitted that France should receive some compensation from Germany. However, he did not want to publicly comment on Borah's entire speech. Today, Hoover and Laval met with the Washington correspondents of American and French newspapers at the White House, stating that after a long talk last night, the two would have another important talk on Sunday. After that, they should jointly issue a communiqué describing the results of the meeting. This afternoon, Laval had a long talk with Borah at Stimson's home. At this time, the general feeling was that Laval's trip would achieve great success in the interests of international finance and economy, and the external atmosphere also said that the talks between the two sides were very harmonious.</p>
<p>Reuters' Washington telegram on the 24th stated that President Hoover and French Prime Minister Laval had agreed on a method to pool American and French banking assets to ensure the stability of the world. The details of the plan have not yet been decided. Laval will go to the White House again tomorrow for a final consultation. Laval is scheduled to return to France on the 26th. Reuters' New York telegram on the 21st stated that the political opinions between French Prime Minister Laval and Senator Borah have not been close after two hours of talks. Laval invited Borah to the French embassy tonight for further talks. It is generally expected that France and the United States currently have no hope of reaching an agreement on important events such as the disarmament security convention, the revision of war debts and compensation.</p>

<p>Peng and Xu, Two Regiment Commanders, Defect</p>
<p>Fighting on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway Has Ceased</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The most intense fighting on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway occurred on the nights of the 14th and 16th. Yu Zhaolin's brigade blew up two Jiangqiao bridges. The largest railway bridge over the Nen River was prepared with buried mines to be detonated when Zhang's army advanced. However, as the fighting commenced, Yu's army gained the upper hand, and Zhang's troops failed to advance, allowing the bridge to be preserved. On the evening of the 15th, Zhang's army, with the assistance of Japanese armored vehicles, launched a fierce attack, but was soon repelled by Yu's brigade. Fighting resumed at noon on the 16th, with three Japanese aircraft providing aerial cover and dropping bombs. Yu's brigade suffered heavy casualties and was in a precarious situation. Fortunately, the Sun and Wang infantry regiments of the Xing'an Reclamation Army arrived from the Mongolian border, threatening to attack Zhang's army from the rear. Zhang, concerned about his rear, reduced his attacking force. In the evening, the armored vehicles returned, unleashing heavy artillery fire, with machine guns and mortars bombarding heavily. Fortunately, Yu's brigade managed to destroy the armored vehicle's locomotive with artillery fire, thwarting Zhang's efforts. There were minor clashes early on the 17th, but they soon ceased. On that day, internal changes occurred within Zhang's army. The Peng and Xu infantry regiments resolutely defected, refusing to obey Zhang's command and planning to return to attack Tao'an. At the same time, Huang Xiansheng, the former commander of the 24th Northeastern Army, arrived in Tao'an from Jinzhou to incorporate the Peng and Xu regiments. With Zhang's strength diminished, he dared not advance further. Due to wavering morale, a large number of Mongolian troops deserted and scattered. Consequently, Zhang retreated to Tao'an at noon on the 18th. Before retreating, he abducted many railway workers along the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line, reportedly to incorporate them into his forces to replenish his strength for a future resurgence. The Japanese troops in Tao'an, originally numbering 300, upon hearing news of the Peng and Xu regiments' plan to attack Tao'an, specially dispatched a regiment each of artillery and infantry from Sipingjie and Gongzhuling to Tao'an on the 18th to help Zhang defend the area. Currently, the Heilongjiang army and the allied Sun, Wang, Peng, and Xu regiments have established an impregnable defensive line on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway. Even if Zhang's army attacks again, it is unlikely to succeed. Ma Zhanshan, the acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province, sent telegrams from Heihe to various brigades, ordering them to firmly defend the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line and prohibiting retreat, otherwise they would be executed. The Su Bingwen brigade of the 2nd Heilongjiang Infantry Brigade stationed in Hailar, along with the Wu Songshan regiment of the 1st Cavalry Brigade, have arrived in succession at Fularji Station to defend the Dongping County area and prevent Zhang's army from attacking from that direction. Another regiment of the Su brigade, along with the Zhang Zhanjiu regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and the Wu Songshan regiment, are stationed at Ang'angxi Station as a general reserve force. The Li Qingshan regiment of Ma Zhanshan's infantry departed from Tonghe County by boat on the 19th for Harbin. Once all troops have arrived, they will be dispatched to Heihe in the next day or two to reinforce defenses. Recently, militia groups have been established in various counties under Heilongjiang's jurisdiction. If necessary, some can be mobilized to assist the army in defending everything. Ma Zhanshan himself was initially reported to have entered Heihe to assume the chairmanship, but this has recently been proven inaccurate. Ma departed from Heihe by boat on the 11th and arrived in Harbin early on the 19th. He secretly traveled from Harbin to Heihe with his adjutant and chief of staff. Very few people knew about it until Ma arrived in Heilongjiang Province. Zhao Zhongren, Dou Lianfang, and Liang Heng, the police chief of the provincial capital, who had previously taken refuge in Harbin, have returned to Heilongjiang Province yesterday because Heihe has been stabilized. Regarding the defection of the Peng and Xu regiments of Zhang Hailpeng's army, it is said that Zhang was hesitant and undecided at the beginning of his invasion of Heilongjiang due to numerous concerns. After repeated pressure from the Japanese consul, 300 Japanese soldiers came to surround Zhang's military governor's office on the 12th, forcing Zhang to order mobilization. Zhang then summoned the Peng and Xu regiment commanders and ordered them to prepare for departure to Heilongjiang. The two regiment commanders kowtowed and said, "We dare not disobey the military governor's order. However, if the regiment commanders see the military governor again, it will be when they are presenting his head." Zhang, believing that the two regiment commanders had always been obedient, did not suspect anything else. However, the two regiment commanders delayed their advance after departing, and later defected. The two regiments were originally part of Huang Xiansheng's old 24th Brigade. Now that Huang has come to incorporate them, the two regiment commanders naturally expressed their obedience. With the fighting concluded, it is reported that traffic on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway will resume between Tailai and Ang'angxi starting from the 20th. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Jilin Generals Refuse Xi Qia's Puppet Orders <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Xi Qia Flatters the Japanese, Displaying Utmost Servility</p>
<p>Merchants and Civilians Unable to Endure Oppression Flee in Droves</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After Xi Qia, under Japanese orders, reorganized the Jilin Provincial Government, he converted all provincial troops into security brigades, with each brigade commander serving as a security commander. However, most brigade and regimental commanders disdained Xi Qia's actions and refused to obey orders and be incorporated. Only a portion of Zhang Zuozhou's 25th Jilin Army stationed in the provincial capital was disarmed because they were unable to retreat when the Japanese army arrived in Jilin. Xi reorganized them into the 1st Infantry Regiment of the 1st Security Brigade, with many former officials being replaced. He also transferred Li Guilin, the former commander of the 23rd Brigade stationed in Changchun, to serve as the brigade commander. Xi assigned Qi Zhizheng, a former military advisor, to incorporate Li's troops and reorganize them into the 2nd Security Brigade. However, although Li Guilin resides in Changchun, within the sphere of Japanese influence, he remains steadfast and refuses to accept Xi's puppet orders. Qi Zhizheng arrived in Changchun on the 16th of this month to take over, but was rejected by Li. Therefore, Xi's Jilin administrator is merely a figurehead. Xi is quite anxious. He recently sent two staff officers, Li and Wu, with a letter to Yushu to meet Zhang Zuozhou, commander of the 25th Brigade, instructing him to hand over all military power, otherwise Zhang's family and property in the province would not be protected. However, Li and Wu have been gone for half a month and have not returned. The unarmed soldiers of the brigade reorganized by Xi have also recently secretly gone to Yushu to rejoin their former brigade commander. Xi also sent Zhai Jingru, the director of the timber and stone tax bureau in the provincial capital, to persuade Li Du, the garrison commander of Yilan, and Ding Qu and Xing Qingzhan in Harbin. After Zhai arrived in Harbin and learned that Ding and Xing's attitude was anti-Xi, he did not dare to show his face and went to Yilan. However, he also failed to achieve his objective. Therefore, Xi Qia's administrator only exercises his power in the Jilin provincial capital. Although Xi previously declared that he would temporarily maintain order in Jilin and not attach himself to any party, he recently appointed Jin Bi'dong, the son of the former Prince Su of the Qing dynasty, as the head of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office and the director of the Jichang and Jidun railways. At the same time, he sent a Japanese advisor, Sanqiao, by plane to Shenyang to participate in the restorationist conference convened by Prince Gong in Shenyang on the 20th of this month. Furthermore, the Jichang and Jihai railways were originally not connected because the Jilin authorities, when constructing the Jihai railway, intended to prevent the two railways from being jointly operated and to prevent them from becoming feeder lines for the South Manchuria Railway. Therefore, the tracks of the two railways were 365 meters apart. Xi Qia has now listened to the Japanese and has started work on connecting the tracks on the 18th of this month. It is expected to be completed in about half a month. The South Manchuria Railway has already connected the Shenhai railway with this line. Now that the Jihai railway is also connected, a Japanese railway network has been formed. Previously (on the 15th), Honjo arrived in Jilin to inspect the troops. Xi Qia led his subordinates to the station to greet him, and in the evening, he held a grand banquet to entertain him. His flattery was like that of a servant to his master. The next day, Xi even fabricated news, saying that Honjo had ordered the Japanese army to retreat to Lianhua Pao outside the city, in order to reassure the people. However, Honjo went to Changchun that evening, and the Japanese army remains stationed in Jilin to this day. Japanese military police, wanting to confiscate firearms from merchants and civilians, have been conducting daily inspections, breaking into homes late at night. If the owners are slow to respond, they are either killed by bayonets or beaten and injured. The suffering of merchants and civilians is worse than that of a conquered people. As a result, they would rather abandon their homes and businesses and flee to other cities. The number of people fleeing Jilin in recent days is no less than that of Shenyang. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">How Many Scoundrels in Liaoning and Shenyang? <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Ma Longtan Declares Himself Chairman of the Sino-Manchurian Association</p>
<p>Zhao Xinbo Illegally Seizes Northeastern Legal Authority</p>
<p>Weng Enyu Takes Over the Liaoning Finance Department</p>
<p>Ma Longtan, Tianjin Dispatch: After the Japanese army occupied Liaoning and Jilin, they declared to the international community that they had no intention of aggression against Chinese territory and that they guaranteed the integrity of Chinese territory. In reality, they are supporting the establishment of new regimes in various regions, instigating the independence of various counties. The Japanese are actively promoting the so-called "small autonomy movement" without any relaxation. In addition to Tieling, Fushun, and other counties that have already declared autonomy, and Sipingjie, which has been established as a city, implementing everything under the direction of Japanese advisors, they also planned to carve out the six counties of Lishu, Changtu, Kaiyuan, Huaide, Tongliao, and Liaoyuan to establish the so-called Sino-Manchurian Province. However, the Japanese now believe that establishing a province is too ambitious and fear opposition from China and the international community. Therefore, they have abandoned the idea of the Sino-Manchurian Province and are instead encouraging the five counties of Changtu, Lishu, Liaoyuan, Huaide, and Kaiyuan to organize a Sino-Manchurian United Independent Autonomy Association to avoid the name of a province while achieving the reality of a province. Tongliao County, located in western Liaoning, is difficult to control. Therefore, only the five counties of Changtu, etc., have united. The association was established on the 15th in Sipingjie, with Ma Longtan as the chairman. It was named the "Sino-Manchurian United Independent Autonomy Association," and its address was set up in the Hongwanzi (Red Swastika) Society compound. Ma Longtan issued an absurd and incoherent declaration, which is recorded below (verbatim, without any deletions or modifications). Declaration: In view of the fact that since the Sino-Japanese incident occurred, the Northeastern government has been destroyed and no longer exists, military police have scattered, rumors have arisen, bandits roam freely, and soldiers and bandits jump over the beams, which are heard from time to time, and the people have lost their wealth and homes, suffering in misery, the state of chaos and the tragic situation is unbearable to witness. Now, fortunately, with the cooperation and support of the gentry and people of Changtu, Lishu, Liaoyuan, Huaide, and Kaiyuan counties, the Sino-Manchurian United Independent Autonomy Association has been established to re-establish all political organs. I, Ma Longtan, have been entrusted by Heaven to respond to the wishes of the people, to investigate the great mission of the Red Swastika Society, and to build a paradise of Sino-Japanese amity based on the highest ideals of universal human love and goodness. Therefore, I declare the establishment of the Sino-Manchurian United Independent Autonomy Association, and I hope that all gentry and people will not disregard it, and I pledge to cooperate. I dare to declare, Ma Longtan, Chairman of the Sino-Manchurian United Independent Autonomy Association, October 15, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Zhao Xinbo, Shenyang: Zhao Xinbo flatters the enemy and seeks glory, holding four positions at once (Mayor of Shenyang, President of the Northeastern Supreme Court, Advisor to the Local Maintenance Association and Self-Defense Bureau), self-satisfied, and already considers himself a loyal subject of Japan. On the 19th, when Zhao went to take office at the Northeastern Supreme Court, upon hearing that Zhang Xueliang had sent Kong Zhaoyan to Liaoning to take the personnel and cases of the Supreme Court to Beiping (according to reports, Mr. Kong is still in Beiping and has not gone to Liaoning), Zhao led many armed military police to search the court and the High Court, intending to arrest Mr. Kong. After finding that Mr. Kong was not there, he took office. Zhao's takeover of the Northeastern Supreme Court was by order of the Local Maintenance Association. The fact that the Local Maintenance Association can issue orders to appoint the president of the Supreme Court shows that its actions are exceeding the bounds. Yuan Jinkai and others still want to deny that he is betraying the country; how shameless! Kong Zhaoyan, the president of the Northeastern Supreme Court Branch, sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Justice and Deputy Commander Zhang yesterday, reporting the matter and requesting that they telegraph to all courts under the jurisdiction of the Northeast to stop sending cases and declare that all judgments made by the court after October 19 are invalid. The original text is as follows: "To the Ministry of Justice in Nanjing and Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping, Greetings. Our court was illegally seized by Zhao Xinbo today. This court handles cases in which Japanese are plaintiffs and Chinese are defendants, or Japanese are plaintiffs and Russian or German defendants. Since the sudden changes in Shenyang, many Japanese litigators have come to the court to inquire about lawsuits and threaten us. Now they have all fallen into their hands. The lives and property of Chinese and Western people are in great danger. It will be easy to provoke negotiations between Russia and Germany in the future. I request that you urgently telegraph all five High Courts in the Northeast (Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and the Eastern Special District) to stop sending cases and declare that all cases judged by the Northeastern Branch of the Supreme Court after October 19 are invalid. Please also have the Deputy Commander telegraph the provincial governments and the Administrative Commissioner of the Eastern Special District to inform the people in all counties and cities, and notify the Russian, German, and Austrian consuls. Furthermore, Zhao Xinbo's appointment this time was by order of the puppet Maintenance Association. The fact that a local Shenyang Maintenance Association can appoint the President of the Northeastern Branch of the Supreme Court is a clear sign of the initiation of a new regime in the five northeastern provinces, with the Japanese in the background, which is especially insidious. I beg the Central Government and the Deputy Commander to pay extra attention. Kong Zhaoyan, President of the Northeastern Branch of the Supreme Court, kowtows."</p>
<p>Weng Enyu, Shenyang: The Liaoning Finance Department is headed by Weng Enyu, the former Director of the Nitrate Mine Bureau, appointed by the Local Maintenance Association. Weng is also shameless and went to the department on the 19th with Japanese advisors to investigate, inspect old items, and sort through files. The Maintenance Association also formulated eight temporary measures, which are recorded in full below: 1. General Provisions: Article 1. The Local Maintenance Committee considers the revival of the Finance Department necessary to ensure public order and restore livelihoods before the establishment of the new regime. Temporary measures are formulated based on its responsibilities to achieve this goal. 2. Organization and Authority: Article 2. The candidate for the head of the Finance Department shall be decided by the Local Maintenance Committee. Article 3. The organization and authority of the Finance Department shall temporarily follow the previous system, but only to the necessary minimum extent. Article 4. In order to improve financial administration, the Local Maintenance Committee shall recruit several Japanese advisors. The head of the Finance Department must respect the opinions of the advisors regarding the implementation of financial administration. 3. Financial Reorganization: Article 5. The Local Maintenance Committee shall establish a Financial Reorganization Committee to formulate tax system reforms and budget preparation. The scope of the committee members shall be as follows: Japanese representatives, representatives of the Local Maintenance Committee, the head of the Finance Department, the section chiefs, the advisors, representatives of the municipal office, representatives of the provincial chamber of commerce, and representatives of the provincial farmers' association (limited to tax system reforms). Supplementary Provisions: Article 6. The head of the Finance Department must consult with the Local Maintenance Committee and promptly issue necessary announcements. When implementing them, prior approval must be obtained from the Japanese army. Article 7. The Local Maintenance Committee shall formulate temporary measures for the Finance Department and seek the approval of the Japanese army for the department's opening. Article 8. For tax collectors of the old regime, if they engage in various tax collection activities, the committee shall request the Japanese authorities to severely punish them according to the resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Martial Law Situation After the Guangzhou Massacre <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the bloodbath on Yonghan Road on the night of Double Ten Festival and the expansion of the turmoil, the authorities suspected that the case had some kind of background and immediately issued an emergency martial law order for the entire city. As a result, all those who held a heart full of blood and came out to lead the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement felt apprehensive and fearful. Some stopped their activities, and some disbanded themselves. The vigorous spirit of the people suddenly became depressed after this blow. However, student groups still mustered their remaining courage and persevered until now. The education authorities have earnestly persuaded them, stating that the Yonghan bloodbath should be left to the government to handle, and that the schools should resume classes first and not neglect their studies because of this incident. In recent days, primary and secondary schools have resumed classes one after another. However, Sun Yat-sen University and its affiliated primary and secondary schools are still persisting to the end, insisting on returning to school only after the Yonghan bloodbath is resolved. Therefore, the only ones currently making a final struggle for the Yonghan bloodbath are all the students of the school. The government, seeing that the students of Sun Yat-sen University were so strong in their attitude, feared that there would be other complications, and the martial law order for the entire city has not been lifted. Troops from outside continue to be transferred in to deploy defenses. The 1st Division of the 1st Army under Yu Hanmou has been deployed from Shaoguan to Xiaoping, Jiaheshi, Shangxia Mao, Modao Keng, and the Baiyun Mountain area. The three regiments of the 1st Training Division and the 2nd Regiment of the 2nd Army have been stationed in the eastern suburbs. In the city, in addition to the return of Zhang Da's 5th Division of the 2nd Army under Xiang Hanping, and the deployment of the 3rd Army Li Yangjing Training Division back to the city after the implementation of martial law, Chen Hanguang's entire Guard Brigade returned to the provincial capital from Huangpu on the 15th by order, and stationed in Yonghan Road, Nanguan, and other places. The martial law order is still in effect in the city, and motor vehicles are also difficult to pass at night. All business shops and night markets have been completely closed. The main points of the martial law measures are as follows: (1) Foot patrols are dispatched daily from 7:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next morning; (2) Citizens' vehicles shall be allowed to travel freely from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. (group gatherings without the permission of the martial law commander are prohibited from passing through the martial law area), but they may be checked at any time if they are suspicious; (3) Pedestrian and vehicle traffic is prohibited from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next morning; (4) Foot patrols shall be stationed at important intersections, crossroads, T-junctions, and busy intersections in each guard area, and the position of the foot patrols shall be determined by the commanders of each unit in consultation with the chief of the public security bureau, and shall be reported to the martial law headquarters; the inspection task shall be carried out by the police under the supervision of the army; (5) Patrol teams shall be dispatched to patrol the roads or inner streets where no foot patrols are stationed; during the martial law period, no officers or soldiers shall leave the camp unless they are on official business or with the permission of their direct superiors.

<p>Six or Seven Thousand People Die in Ningdu Within Ten Days</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The areas of Yudu, Xingguo, Ningdu, and Huichang in southern Jiangxi have been ravaged by bandits for several years. This summer, after the efforts of the central army to suppress them, they fought in the deep mountains and valleys for three months. The battles of Liantang, Dongcun, Wangbi, Xiaopu, and Longgang were fierce, and the number of deaths and injuries was unprecedented. Corpses littered the fields, and there was no time to bury them, so epidemics were inevitable. According to news from the party-government council, although the main force of the Red bandits has fled far away after Ningdu was recovered by the National Army for the second time, sporadic small groups have not yet been completely eliminated. Therefore, refugees from the surrounding villages are still crowding into the city. After the looting, the displaced people eat wind and sleep in the open, and death from illness is common. The city has a large population, and hygiene is out of the question. Excrement is all over the ground, and garbage is like a mountain, so that epidemics are rampant. In the past ten days, the number of deaths has reached six or seven thousand, mostly wounded soldiers and refugees. There are no coffins to buy, and many are abandoned in the wild. In addition, for dozens of miles around the city, trees and crops have been cut down and burned, and oil, salt, rice, and grain have been looted. A pound of salt sells for as much as one yuan, and the rest can be imagined. It is difficult for the surviving people after the looting to prolong their lives, which is very painful. (October 23)</p>

<p>A Terrible Phenomenon After the Great Flood</p>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: Since the breaches in the dykes of the Jianggao counties, the mournful cries have lingered for over two months. Although officials, gentry, and Chinese and foreign philanthropists have repeatedly tried to provide relief to the disaster victims in the affected areas, the disaster area is too large and the situation is unstable, so the order of the Huaiyang area is still difficult to restore to normal. The most unbearable situation is in the Lixiahe area, where epidemics are spreading severely, and it is very difficult to provide medical treatment. Even in the refugee camps in Yangzhou City, with the autumn wind piercing the bones, the number of disaster victims suffering from illness is increasing every day. Yesterday, I passed through the refugee camp in the Xu Gong Temple outside Guangchu Gate and saw that most of the refugees in the camp had a sallow complexion. Of those moaning in the straw piles, five or six out of ten were suffering from dysentery, and the infection was extremely rapid. The sick often could not make it to the toilet and urinated in their pants, and there were many who had no second pair of pants to change into. Therefore, the filthy air was overwhelming, and the infection increased in strength. The illnesses of small children are mostly measles, and deaths are being reported every day. If isolation is not arranged, even non-disaster victims may be affected. The area west of Gaoyou Shaobo Lake was originally a bandit-producing area. Since Zhang Zhijiang's pacification, many bandits have fled to the Anhui border. After this flood, order in various places has inevitably been disrupted, and bandits have taken the opportunity to make a comeback. On the 14th of this month, a large number of local bandits suddenly came to Bian Tang Town in the west of Gaoyou County, looting the town and kidnapping hundreds of meat tickets. Also, in the two counties of Tianchang and Xuyi, which border Jiangsu, many groups of bandits are active. Although the pacification office has sent teams to suppress them, the general public has no livelihood and takes risks.</p>

<p>The number of those joining bandit gangs is increasing day by day. If we do not provide both relief and pacification and restore their original occupations, the area will have no peace.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Increased Coal Freight Rates on the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This past summer, the Jiaoji Railway increased coal freight rates by 20%, leading to a strike by coal merchants along the entire line. The railway bureau was forced to rescind the order. Unexpectedly, after a short interval, the old issue has been raised again, with a notice that coal freight rates will again be increased by 20% starting November 1st. Coal merchants along the entire line are greatly alarmed and have risen up in opposition. Zichuan and Boshan, the only coal-producing areas in the province, sent representatives Ding Jingchen, Zhuang Shuting, and others to Jinan to petition Industry Bureau Chief Wang Fangting. Their reasons for opposing the increase are as follows: Now that the Japanese army occupies our Northeast, the whole country is united in resisting Japanese goods and promoting domestic products. The Shanghai anti-Japanese meeting resolved not to purchase Japanese coal and to use domestic coal exclusively, but stipulated that the price of coal should be around twelve taels of silver per ton, and coal merchants should not deliberately raise prices. Currently, the freight cost of transporting coal from Zibo to Qingdao is about four yuan per ton, and the cost of transporting it to Shanghai is already more than twelve taels of silver, making it impossible to compete with coal merchants elsewhere. Now, in the midst of this nationwide resistance against Japanese goods and promotion of domestic products, the Jiaoji Railway is increasing freight rates, not only making them higher than those of any other railway, thus depriving Shandong coal of export opportunities and threatening the livelihood of coal merchants and mine owners, but also contradicting the goal of promoting domestic goods and resisting Japanese goods. Therefore, coal merchants and mine owners along the entire line, standing on the ground of resisting Japan and saving the country, are vehemently opposed to the increase and demand its cancellation, requesting the same treatment as other railways. If the Jiaoji Railway authorities stubbornly ignore this and insist on the increase, they will decide to go on strike until their goal is achieved, and so on. Industry Bureau Chief Wang Fangting indicated that the merchants' stated reasons were indeed valid, but the Jiaoji Railway's action had been approved by the Ministry of Railways and could not be directly intervened. He would forward the matter to the central government, conveying the merchants' suffering and awaiting instructions from the ministry. Currently, the representatives are still in Jinan, contacting local coal merchants to unanimously oppose the increase. Today, I visited representative Ding Jingchen, and according to him, "Zi"chuan, Boshan, Zhangqiu and other counties produce about 3,000 tons of coal per day, of which about 15% is lump coal. In recent years, due to various factors and the high freight rates, users' burdens have increased, and merchants have also experienced difficulties. This past summer, the Jiaoji Railway increased freight rates by 20%, forcing coal merchants to go on strike. The price increase was not mandated by the ministry, and at that time, colleagues went to the ministry to petition, stating that the Jiaoji Railway's freight rates were already higher than those of other railways. All they requested was equal treatment with other railways, or they would rather die in the ministry than leave. Seeing their firm resolve, the Ministry of Railways telegraphed the Jiaoji Railway for a response. Later, colleagues returned to Jinan and met with Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee. Ge agreed to temporarily not increase prices, but stated that official procedures could not be canceled. Instead, the 20% increase would be changed to a freight rebate returned to coal merchants by the railway bureau (the Jiaoji Railway traditionally reduced freight rates by 20% during the summer when coal merchants' business was poor, calling it a rebate). Afterwards, a fair method would be formulated, and transportation would resume. Unexpectedly, four months later, just as colleagues were hoping for a revised fair method, the Jiaoji Railway again increased freight rates by 20%, directly threatening the livelihood of coal merchants and indirectly blocking Shandong's industry. In reality, even without the increase, the Jiaoji Railway's freight rates are already more than two li higher than those of the Jinpu Railway, making it difficult to compete with coal merchants on other railways. Currently, Shanghai has a resolution to use domestic coal, and Zibo's output could supply it, but due to freight rates, it is impossible. Even within Shandong province, the Yixian Zhongxing Company transports coal to Pukou, a distance of 440 kilometers, at a freight rate of 2.2 yuan, which is 5 li per ton per kilometer. From Jinan to Shanghai, the freight rate is just over one yuan per ton, making the total freight rate to Shanghai less than 3.5 yuan per ton. In contrast, from Zibo to Qingdao is 345 kilometers, with a freight rate of 7.3 li per ton per kilometer, totaling 2.5 yuan per ton. From Qingdao to Shanghai, the freight rate is over three yuan per ton, making the total freight rate to Shanghai over 5.5 yuan per ton. This calculation is based on the freight rates of the Jiaoji Railway before the increase, and it is already impossible for Zibo coal to be transported to Shanghai for sale. Furthermore, considering the market price in Shanghai, current Shanghai coal costs 10 taels and 7.5 qian per ton. Using current freight rates, transporting Zibo coal to Shanghai already requires a loss of 5 jiao per ton. Therefore, coal merchants and mine owners in Zibo cannot accept the 20% increase. However, in these difficult times for the country, they will not easily strike as they did this past summer unless absolutely necessary. They will only reduce production and temporarily maintain the current situation. This measure will inevitably affect users in Qingdao and Jinan, but they have no choice in order to protect their investment." Local correspondence.</p>

<p>Methods for Identifying Suspected Japanese Goods. The Wuxian Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has spared no effort in inspecting Japanese goods in recent days. Over 500 pieces of Japanese goods have been sealed up, but none have been identified. Merchants are worried about their investments and businesses, and have requested speedy identification and return of non-Japanese goods. The Anti-Japanese Association convened a representative meeting yesterday (25th) and resolved that the sealed Japanese goods would be identified and dealt with. Suspected Japanese goods would be temporarily released to the merchants who provide a shop guarantee and have the industry association and chamber of commerce responsible for them. Samples would be kept for identification. If the goods are found to be Japanese, they will be fined ten times the value of the goods. Future inspections of Japanese goods will be handled in the same manner. Therefore, merchants have been applying for the return of suspected Japanese goods with guarantees.</p>

<p>Social Economy in a State of Despair. The harvest in the town this spring, summer, and autumn was poor, and the crops were flooded. The social economy is in a state of panic. In recent months, the silk market has suffered disastrous losses. Factories have suffered heavy losses, with some losing over 100,000 yuan and others losing 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. As a result, they are unable to maintain operations. Factories such as Taifu and Yulun have closed down, and others are raising funds to pay wages in preparation for closure. There are also several factories that are unable to pay wages. Banks and pawnshops have no confidence in recovering their loans. They have been contacting factory managers to discuss repayment plans, but many are avoiding them because the amounts are too large to repay. Loans to the silk, cloth, foreign goods, hardware, electrical materials, and southern goods industries are also unlikely to be repaid because the goods are sealed up and circulation is slow. Therefore, the financial sector is extremely uneasy, and most are collecting money but not lending it. The social economy is in a state of despair.</p>
<p>Husband Catches Wife in Adultery, Wife Attempts Suicide. Mao Shengcai, a resident of No. 12 Shafentuan, Guangfu Gate, works as an accountant at Hongxingsheng Meat Shop near the Great Bridge. His wife, Wang, was unfaithful and had an affair with the landlord, Peng Rulin. They were very intimate, like husband and wife. Yesterday at 9:00 AM, Wang and Rulin were meeting in room 6 of the Park Hotel. While they were being amorous, Mao discovered them and gathered several people to catch them in the act. The adulterer and adulteress were caught on the spot and sent to the First Public Security Bureau for investigation. Wang, feeling ashamed, took off her gold earrings and swallowed them. At 1:00 PM, the chief of the High Branch Bureau prepared a document and sent police to escort her to the General Bureau. Unexpectedly, while passing the New Zhong Bridge, Wang took advantage of a moment of inattention and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was rescued quickly and did not drown. After arriving at the Public Security Bureau, the department chief questioned her. The adulterer Peng Rulin was detained, Mao Shengcai was ordered to return home, and Mao Wang was sent to the Labor Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, her life is in danger.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Opinions on Relief for the Sixteen Provinces Flood by Xiong Xiling <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>(1) Division of Labor and Cooperation. The scale of the floods in sixteen provinces is broader than the floods in Hebei Province in 1917. Handling it is even more challenging. The Hebei floods in 1917 were managed by a special superintendent appointed by the government, with full power. The governor of the province was only in a supporting role. All relief funds and labor costs were allocated by the central government. The superintendent had the authority to handle transportation, tax exemptions, and rewards and punishments for officials. Therefore, his operation was flexible, and his distribution was thorough. Millions of disaster victims were not frozen or starved. This demonstrates the effectiveness of a single administrative organ. In the case of the floods in the various provinces this time, the central government has established a flood relief committee, and each province has established a branch. This system of collective consultation will inevitably lead to delays, which is an obstacle to the principle of rapid relief. The division of authority between the central government and the provinces is unclear, and responsibilities are not divided. In the future, there will inevitably be mutual shirking, mutual disputes, and mutual blaming. The disaster victims who are crying out for help will suffer in vain. I believe that the central government and local governments should clearly define their respective powers and divide their responsibilities. The central government should be responsible for major construction projects, transportation of relief supplies, tax reductions and exemptions, distribution of relief funds, management of price stabilization, fundraising, and planning strategies. Local governments should be responsible for distributing winter and spring relief, repairing official and private embankments, and all other relief efforts. If the local relief and construction funds are insufficient, the central government can provide subsidies. However, the central government must send personnel to supervise the distribution in order to achieve effective benefits for the people. This method was used by the Superintendent's Office for the floods in the capital area in 1917. Local gentry and charitable organizations have close relationships with the local community and religious beliefs, which are better than those of officials. Secondly, because the disaster area is too large, the central government does not have enough talent to employ. Therefore, a compromise was adopted. The Superintendent's Office proposed relief funds of over one million yuan and entrusted the Shunzhi Relief Bureau to distribute winter relief, and proposed 500,000 yuan to entrust the Zhili Righteous Relief Bureau to distribute spring relief, and proposed 900,000 yuan to subsidize various miscellaneous relief efforts. The Superintendent's Office also assigned relief investigation committee members to go to the disaster area with the gentry to review the severity of the disaster, and then assigned relief supervision committee members to supervise the distribution to verify that there were no irregularities in the relief funds. Furthermore, fearing that the above two committee members might be biased or derelict in their duties, the president was requested to appoint special inspectors to visit and investigate whether the assigned committee members were performing their duties. Therefore, although the Superintendent's Office released over 2.4 million yuan in relief funds, it did not directly handle a single penny of the distribution. Secondly, for river works, due to the lack of talent at that time, it was necessary to continue to use the experience and skilled workers of the old river workers. However, fearing that they would repeat their old habits due to accumulated malpractices, when the River Bureau submitted the estimated work budget, the chairman of the Five Great River Survey and Defense Committee was first sent with the committee members to inspect the estimated work budget and the needs for blocking and building. Once the estimated calculation was finalized, the funds were allocated, and the committee members for supervising the project and inspecting the project were sent to supervise whether the project was verified and free from irregularities. During the autumn flood season, supervisory committee members were sent to work to check whether the river committee members were performing their duties. Those who were found to be fraudulent or incompetent were severely punished at any time to serve as a warning to others. Therefore, although the flood this year rose sharply, the Five Great Rivers were able to celebrate safety because of this. However, there was also a notable feature at the time, that is, the chairmen of the committees supervising the various works were all military personnel, and the assistants accompanying the practice were all students from the Southern Haihe Engineering School and the Shandong Engineering Bureau. They were able to endure hardship, overcome sentimentality, and were more responsible than other officials. This is the past experience of river works for the floods in Hebei Province. This time, the disaster has affected several provinces, and it is even more necessary to distinguish the powers and responsibilities of the central government and local governments in order to have the benefit of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>(2) Division of Miscellaneous Relief. The vastness of the disaster areas and the large number of disaster victims in the sixteen provinces are several times greater than in Hebei Province in 1917. Relying solely on the financial and human resources of the central government is insufficient to cope. Moreover, construction relief only covers the able-bodied, and the elderly and weak will inevitably be left out. Direct relief only covers winter and spring, while production must also be taken into account. In 1917, the central government allocated only over 2.4 million yuan for the floods in Hebei Province, while the number of miscellaneous relief efforts independently organized by various counties and the number of charitable groups reached over 2 million yuan. This is the efficiency of division of labor. The following are about nine items that were handled:</p>
<p>First, price stabilization. After the flood, grain merchants and wealthy families inevitably stockpiled and increased prices. The poorest and next poorest relied on relief, and middle-class households who could buy food were also in trouble. Therefore, there must be price stabilization. However, because the disaster area is vast, the key is for merchants to be greedy for high prices and transport more grain to ensure a continuous supply. If you rely solely on central and local government officials to stabilize prices, you will not only lack the power to supply the entire area, but you will also fear that the pricing will be too low, which will hinder the source of commercial goods. Therefore, the price of this price stabilization can only be slightly lower than the price of commercial goods by two coins to prevent it from rising, but not to prevent the arrival of goods. Therefore, although the central government stipulated that 500,000 shi of grain should be stabilized in price in 1917, the result was that only over 84,000 shi were transported, and over 858,000 yuan was spent, and the market price was flat. This was all due to the slightly lower pricing and the large amount of commercial goods transported.</p>
<p>Second, coal relief. After the flood, all the grasses were submerged, and fuel became a problem for the people. Although there was grain relief, it was difficult to eat without fuel. The south mostly used firewood, and the poor had no money to buy it. Therefore, this item is indispensable. In addition to the 10,000 tons purchased and transported by the Superintendent's Office in Hebei Province in 1917, various coal mining companies donated thousands of tons and distributed them to 41 counties. This time, the large coal mining companies in the north and south should be urged to donate coal to the best of their ability to complete this task.</p>
<p>Third, loans. After the flood, small-scale industrial and commercial businesses in various cities and counties were trapped. If methods are not taken to help them, they will inevitably become unemployed. In Hebei Province in 1917, the majority of the 100,000 households in the eight counties of Gaoyang, Baoding, Raoyang, Tianjin, Renqiu, and Suning Li were engaged in weaving. Each household has an average of five people, which is 500,000 people. If they lose their jobs due to the disaster, not only will production be reduced, but the weaving machines will also be at risk. Therefore, the Superintendent's Office borrowed 1 million yuan in yarn from the spinning company and distributed it to the cloth merchants to distribute to the weavers without interest, so that the livelihood of these 100,000 households could be protected. The yarn price was recovered in full the following year. The government only spent tens of thousands of yuan in interest. This time, there are many small industrial and commercial businesses in the various provinces and ports. The central government should discuss with the Shanghai banking groups to raise huge amounts of money to form a lending bank and use the above method to help countless small businesses. According to the large disaster area and the large number of disaster victims this time, it is estimated that at least 10,000 yuan of various bank notes held by those affected by the flood have been submerged and lost. It is also natural for banks to fulfill this obligation. In addition, the profit bureau can also order each county to imitate the practices of Hebei Province in 1917, which collected funds and established 309 offices, which were helpful to small industrial and commercial businesses.</p>
<p>Fourth, righteous pawnshops. After the flood, the small farmers in the villages were particularly poor. Although they had several acres of land to sell, they had no money to cultivate it. How could they survive? They must establish righteous pawnshops to allow them to mortgage their real estate. A total of 29 were established in various counties of Hebei Province in 1917. In the years of famine in Shanxi Province, the provincial government formulated regulations ordering each county to instruct the wealthy households in their villages or the wealthy households in neighboring villages that were not affected by the disaster to mortgage the real estate, which was very effective after the autumn harvest. The China Foreign Famine Relief Commission has operated credit cooperatives in Hebei to provide mutual assistance lending methods, which can also be adopted. (To be continued)</p>

<p>According to news from the Guangdong Delegates' Office yesterday, the progress of peace and unification is uncertain because the delegates from Nanjing have not yet been formally decided. Therefore, it is impossible to predict when the consultation can begin. As for the Guangdong delegates, in addition to visiting Mr. Hu Zhantang at the Hu residence every morning, they gather at the Sun residence every afternoon to discuss detailed and specific plans for fundamentally improving the current systems of party affairs, politics, military affairs, and diplomacy based on the principle of establishing democratic politics, in order to present them for discussion during the preparation of the peace conference.</p>

<p>According to Wang Jingwei, speaking to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, the Nanjing side has formally appointed Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng Chen Mingshu, five people as delegates.

After they meet and discuss, they can start to convene the preparatory meeting in the afternoon of the day (26th).

According to Zou Lu, speaking to reporters, the Beijing side entrusted Zhang Puquan to bring a letter to the Guangdong delegates today, and has appointed Zhang Cai Zhang Li Chen as delegates to the peace conference. Today is Sunday, and the meeting procedures have not yet been contacted, so the meeting cannot be held. Tomorrow (26th) may be able to meet and talk.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Wang Jingwei's Statement Yesterday <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei made the following statement yesterday: "Mr. Chiang's telegram of resignation and the telegram of the abolition of the Guangzhou National Government have the greatest significance in bringing an end to the disputes of the past few years and ushering in a new era from now on. What are the characteristics of this new era? Although it is difficult to say in one sentence, its greatest significance is to liberate politics from the control of military forces. Politics under the control of military forces will never have good politics. No matter what kind of military forces, they cannot be allowed to control politics. This is the dividing line between modern countries and barbaric countries. In barbaric countries, there must be special forces, especially military forces, to seize power. In modern countries, as long as you get the trust of the people, you can seize power without military forces, especially without military forces. Active military personnel must resign from their active military positions if they want to engage in politics. Only in this way can they avoid holding military forces to threaten politics. In modern countries, active military personnel are absolutely trusted by the people because they are focused on national defense. National defense is absolutely necessary, so active military personnel are also absolutely trusted by the people. As for engaging in politics, there will inevitably be political enemies, because political views are relative, not absolute. Understanding this point, you can know that no matter how transcendent a person is, he cannot take care of both military and political affairs at the same time.</p>

<p>Madam Sun sent a letter to this newspaper saying: "To the editor of Shen Bao: The news in the Shishi Xinbao of October 25th that Qingling intends to participate in the so-called peace conference is completely inaccurate. I have asked for an immediate correction. In the future, please verify any news about Qingling's personal words and deeds before disclosing them. As for Qingling's opinions on the current situation, I will officially send a letter to the newspapers for publication. Sincerely, I wish you peace. Sun Song Qingling, October 25th."</p>
<h3 id="e86">Hu's Proposal to Postpone the Fourth National Congress <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth National Congress was previously decided by the Central Committee to be convened on November 12th. Now, the date is pressing, and representatives from overseas to the Fourth National Congress have already been reporting their arrival. However, it coincides with an urgent diplomatic situation, and the Peace and Unification Conference is currently underway. All parties are paying close attention to whether the Fourth National Congress will be held as scheduled. According to reliable sources yesterday, Mr. Hu Zhantang advocates that the Fourth National Congress should be held after the peaceful unification, and should be postponed to March of next year before being convened. All the representatives to the Fourth National Congress who have been selected should be cancelled and new elections should be held. This is because both the Beijing and Guangdong sides had previously convened the Fourth National Congress. Now that there is unification, there should be a new convocation. The past party affairs disputes have become history. Since the Fourth National Congress is being convened separately, the representatives should also be elected separately, it is said.</p>

In total, there were more than a hundred people welcoming him at the North Station yesterday. At 4:50 pm, the Beijing-Shanghai special express train arrived on time. After Mr. Xie got off the train, all the welcoming personnel stepped forward to shake hands and exchange greetings, expressing their welcome. Mr. Xie also shook hands and thanked them one by one, frequently taking off his hat as a courtesy. Xie traveled light, wearing a gray gown, with graying temples, showing signs of illness. Because of his poor foot condition, he used a cane to help him walk, moving very slowly. He was accompanied by the welcoming representatives and boarded a pre-arranged car, heading directly to Hu Hanmin's residence.</p>

<p>More than a Thousand People in the Main Factory and Distribution Center</p>
<p>Because the Management Refused to Allow Li Hongbin to Return to Work</p>

<h3 id="e92">Reasons for the Strike <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Li Hongbin, an officer of the Zhonghua Book Company branch of the Municipal Publishing Industry Trade Union, was dismissed by the management. On the 22nd, the trade union received an order from the Social Bureau approving his return to work. Representatives Wang Wenhua and Wang Yongliang of the trade union, holding the approval, together with Yang Yinlin and Wang Jiping, officers of the Social Bureau's office, contacted Chen Xiegong and Wang Jinshi, the directors of the factory and distribution center. Chen and Wang stated that General Manager Lu Feikui had not been notified in advance and could not allow him to return to work. Later, Wang Wenhua went to the Social Bureau for instructions, and Wang Bin was sent to the factory as a representative, scolding Wang Jinshi face to face, saying that the factory must abide by the government's approval order and allow Li to return to work tomorrow. The director readily agreed, but unexpectedly, when Li Hongbin went to return to work on the 23rd, the factory refused again. The workers of the factory were very angry that the factory dared to defy government laws and regulations, so they spontaneously went on strike at 4 pm the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Employees' Congress <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>

Lu Zhonglun was elected chairman, and reported on the entire process of the strike by all workers in the main factory. The atmosphere at the scene was very tense. It was immediately resolved that: (1) Starting today, responding to the main factory, all will automatically go on strike; (2) Refuse customers politely; (3) Strictly maintain order.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Overall Strike <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>More than 800 workers in the main factory of the Zhonghua Book Company on Jing'an Temple Road spontaneously went on strike at 4 pm the day before yesterday because they opposed the management violating the Social Bureau's order and refusing to allow trade union officer Li Hongbin to return to work. Yesterday was Sunday, which was a regular holiday, and today the strike continues. More than 130 employees of the Fourth Malu distribution center, after a general meeting, unanimously went on strike at 1 pm yesterday when business hours started. Slogans were posted on the gate and windows, such as "Today's strike, customers please forgive us," "Li Hongbin will not return to work, we will not work," "We want to protect government laws and regulations," and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Group Leaders' Petition <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Zhonghua Book Company branch of the Publishing Industry Trade Union submitted ten conditions for improving treatment three months ago. After repeated mediation by the Social Bureau, it was impossible to resolve them because the management refused to attend, and the mediation was declared unsuccessful and submitted to arbitration. At 10 am the day before yesterday, more than a hundred group leaders and officers went to the Municipal Government to petition, demanding prompt arbitration. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received them and promised to arbitrate within the next week.</p>

<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited Xue Ji'an, director of the distribution center of the bureau, yesterday and asked for the company's opinion on the employees' strike. According to him, after the employees went on strike, he reported the situation to General Manager Lu Fei Bohong for verification and handling. The worker Li Hongbin of the main factory was actually dismissed for violating the rules and fighting with workers in the same factory. After the employees of the distribution center went on strike today, customers hesitated and business declined greatly. Fortunately, it is now the off-season, and the daily loss is only about a thousand yuan, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Merchants Voluntarily Seal Up Japanese Goods <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Wu Banjiang, a member of the Japanese Goods Inspection Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Federation, together with Chen Guangxin and other members of the Ninth District Branch, began inspecting Japanese goods yesterday. At the Ruiyuanxiang Foreign Goods General Store and branch on Zhejiang Road, Yongyuanxiang Foreign Goods Store on Avenue Edward VII, the Cooperative Store, Xinyitai Store, Xiangchang Native Products Store, Zhentai Porcelain Store, Tiandetang Pharmacy, Zhicheng Printing House, Fukang Native Products Store, Zhu Fuxing Store, Wanshunxiang Sock Factory, Hengxingchang Foreign Goods Store, and others, many kinds of Japanese goods were sealed up. The guest merchants filled out voluntary statements of never buying or selling Japanese goods to express their determination to sever economic relations with Japan forever. Before inspecting and sealing the Japanese goods, the merchants had already packed the hateful goods into boxes to wait for the inspection committee to seal them up. This kind of spontaneous patriotic enthusiasm is truly admirable.</p>

<p>The Wuhu Cloth Industry Guild believes that resisting Japanese goods and promoting national goods should be given equal emphasis.

It is now known that Cui and Huang arrived in Shanghai yesterday and went to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Goods Factory Federation to request assistance in introducing them to visit factories for on-the-spot investigations.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Second Group of Refugees from the Shenyang Arsenal Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Forming a Maintenance Group to Petition the Municipal Government</p>
<p>After the violent Japanese army occupied Liaoning, the machinery, raw materials, guns, and bullets of the Shenyang Arsenal were all moved away by the Japanese army, and all personnel were forced to leave the factory. The second group arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and formed a maintenance group to petition. The first group of personnel sent a telegram to Mayor Zhang yesterday, requesting placement. The Arsenal Department is now working on finding placements. The details of each item are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Second Group Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The second group of refugees from the Shenyang Arsenal, who arrived in Shanghai on October 20th, a total of 260 people, are temporarily living in the Qu Zhenren Temple in Gaochang Temple. They formed a maintenance group and held a general meeting at 8 am the day before yesterday. After the meeting, the entire group went to the Municipal Government to petition, requesting (1) maintenance of food and (2) placement of work. Municipal Government Counselor Sun Baozhen received them and ordered them to go to the National Government Relief Committee regarding the maintenance of food, and promised to telegraph the Military and Political Department's Arsenal Department regarding the placement of work. The entire group was satisfied and returned. In the afternoon, representatives Song Shaofu, Chen Zailiang, Fan Yaozhang, Yu Guanlin, etc. were appointed to request maintenance from the National Government Relief Committee. The Relief Committee agreed to give each person a relief payment of four yuan, as in the case of the first group.</p>

<p>The first group of refugees sent a telegram yesterday, saying, "Most Urgent, Respectfully Addressed to Mayor Zhang of the Shanghai Municipal Government, We, the group, petitioned a few days ago, and you kindly forwarded the telegram to the Military and Political Department to find a factory for assignment, and directed us to the Water Disaster Relief Association, which thankfully gave each person four yuan, maintaining our current livelihood. We members are grateful beyond measure. However, we have found that the relief funds of the association come from donations, dividing a cup of soup among many people, filling our empty stomachs. Although it is unavoidable, it is emotionally difficult. Who has no conscience and can not feel ashamed? Furthermore, although we members lack outstanding skills, we still have our strengths. We have been in the factory for many years and have a wealth of experience. At this time of national crisis, military equipment is essential, and it is even more necessary to preserve arsenal personnel. Moreover, since our factory has been occupied by the Japanese and the Han factory has just started construction, there are not many existing factories and limited output. Once we go to war with the enemy, we are afraid that there will be a shortage of guns, ammunition, and explosives. As mere laborers, we members have no ability to change things. However, if the country wants to resist foreign aggression, it is not appropriate to ignore this talent for expanding military equipment. We have been waiting for more than ten days, and the reply telegram is still silent. We have no choice but to be anxious. We believe that the Mayor is a famous expert in industry and a pioneer in the labor world. Even though you are now dedicated to municipal administration, you have a clear understanding of the national crisis and the plight of the workers. What is there to say? Since you kindly telegraphed us before, we will seek your continued safety and telegraph you again, so that you can assign us to a factory as soon as possible, so that we will not be delayed in Shanghai for a long time, relying on the second-hand relief. If the Military Department agrees, we vow to work hard on the one hand, manufacturing military equipment, and on the other hand, publicize our suffering to the workers, inspiring public loyalty, in order to be the pioneers of courage and the rear shield against Japan. This is the responsibility that we members should fulfill, and it is also the only way to repay your kindness. The Eastern Province Arsenal Refugees Petition Maintenance Group Chief Supervisor and Clerk Li Tiechen, Representatives Dai Xiuzhai, Wang Wenlong, She Guilin, Zhang Longshun, together with all the members, respectfully kowtow, respectfully kowtow."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Case of Japanese Residents Shooting and Wounding Chinese Police <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Representations from Anti-Japanese Associations of Various Universities</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that Japanese residents Nishimura Matsumoto and others, on the night of the 21st of this month, provoked trouble and shot and wounded police officer Wang Changshun of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on Le'an Road and East Yokohama Road. After detailed investigation by the Municipal Government, a serious protest was lodged with the Japanese Consulate. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Students from various universities in this port, because this case occurred in the Public Concession, specially sent a letter to Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Public Works Department, yesterday, inquiring about everything and hoping that the Public Works Department will guarantee that such incidents will not happen again in the future. Representatives Nie Haifan and Hu Wenquan were also sent to the Municipal Government to visit Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, requesting serious negotiations. The original text of their letter to Fessenden is recorded below: "Respectfully Sir, according to news reports, Japanese people committed violence in North Sichuan Road, shooting and wounding police officer Wang Changshun, which is shocking to hear. We have investigated the duties of your bureau, which are to maintain law and order. This time, Japanese people rioted, and you failed to prevent it in advance and failed to stop it afterwards, resulting in this unfortunate incident. Furthermore, the murderer was arrested on the spot but was released without legal sanctions. What is your bureau's responsibility for encouraging thugs to run rampant and endangering the people? We hope that you will reply and that your bureau will absolutely guarantee that such incidents will not happen again in the future. We are sending this letter in response and hope that you will investigate and take action, Fessenden of the Public Works Department."</p>
<h3 id="e106">Zhang Yaozeng's Letter to the People of the Country (3) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>All of my unemployed countrymen, if you have assets, then donate to military needs, relieve disasters, create businesses, and harmonize society. All speculative and lewd lifestyles must be strictly eliminated. If you have no assets, then invigorate your spirits, endure hardships, and sell your labor, or serve on the front lines, or seek work. As long as there is an effective place, do not ask about the advantages and disadvantages of treatment. All wandering and troublemaking lifestyles must be strictly eliminated. All of my countrymen who are engaged in academic pursuits, if you are in a teaching position, then strictly correct the academic atmosphere, honestly purchase and teach, and cultivate knowledgeable and capable talents. At the same time, strive to improve and create new frontiers in scholarship to guide people's lives and increase social utility. General students should be humble and self-respecting, strenuously avoid floating and frivolousness, and practice their patriotic work from reading and being a person. Intensify the cultivation of intelligence to be a tool for subduing the enemy. Intensify physical training so that they have the qualifications to serve on the battlefield in the end. Those who are like this are called total national mobilization. With China's vast land and large population, if total national mobilization is carried out, what is unbreakable, let alone Japan? However, our nation's resistance to violent Japan also has its own meaning and boundaries, which must be carefully considered. First, self-defense. As humanity evolves, all nations are only allowed to govern and defend themselves and are not allowed to infringe upon each other. Japan, regardless of the destruction of public reason, rampantly carries out aggression. My countrymen should each implement total mobilization, taking any effective means for self-defense. However, the purpose is only self-defense, so if Japan can repent and completely withdraw its aggression and compensate for the losses, then our country does not necessarily have to resort to arms. Even if violent Japan persists in its delusion, and we have no choice but to resort to arms, it should naturally be limited to completely eliminating its aggression and compensating for our losses. Excessive oppression and local retaliation are certainly not allowed. Second, safeguarding human civilization. Humanity has been blindly walking in the dark night for a long time. After the World War, a glimmer of dawn was seen, knowing that private wars should be eliminated and culture should be developed together. Therefore, international efforts to maintain peace and international systems to maintain peace have been gradually emphasized, such as the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the agreement on reducing armaments. These are the sprouts of this trend, and the future is still far away. Japan suddenly cannot restrain itself and wants to destroy it, making humanity return to the black night. This is truly a great threat to human culture, how can it only be a harm to my Chinese nation? All nations moving toward civilization have a great responsibility to correct and salvage it. How can it be that only my nation should resist it? The reason why our country does not hastily declare war on Japan, but firmly requests the League of Nations to impose sanctions, is not out of self-preservation, nor out of dependence. It is temporarily enduring its own humiliation to maintain the new opportunities for humanity that are about to be cut off, and to supervise the comrades of various countries to give full play to the practical effects of the new structure of civilization. Therefore, while my countrymen are implementing total mobilization, they should still cooperate with the League of Nations, relying on its organization and strength, to restore justice and maintain peace. If the League of Nations is equal to a void, and the countries cannot uphold justice strictly or cannot resolutely exert their strength, then my nation, for the sake of the future of human civilization, should go to war, even with a single horse and a tattered gun, without hesitation. This is also the attitude that my countrymen should adopt. Alas, survival and defeat, prosperity and ruin, the crisis is imminent. All of my countrymen have a heart to sacrifice themselves and save the country, but if they do not act in the right way, they will only increase the disasters. In my humble opinion, the only way is to truly awaken, truly unite, and implement total national mobilization to defend ourselves and protect human civilization. There is no better way than this. I, Yaozeng, am clumsy and unskilled. I used to participate in the great government and had many views on sovereignty. In recent years, I have been living by my own efforts at sea, preserving my life. I am indifferent to the order and chaos of national affairs. When I reflect on myself in the quiet night, I am also one of the people who caused the chaos and weakness. Encountering this national crisis, I dare not avoid taboos again and remain silent. I sincerely disclose what I have seen in my conscience to all my countrymen. If I am pardoned and deeply reflect upon it, it would be fortunate indeed. Furthermore, I attach to this that my writing of this book is purely motivated by a sincere concern for the country. I not only have absolutely no hope for political power, but also do not participate in any internal political movements. What I hold to join the total mobilization and serve the country is only the two things mentioned above: diligently studying academics and supporting public opinion. I also express this to the workers for their appraisal. Zhang Yaozeng, October 21, 20th year.</p>

<p>No Concrete Results</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the directors and managers of various Japanese textile mills in this port held a special meeting yesterday (the 24th) afternoon at the Japanese Club to report on the situation and discuss countermeasures to the Chinese economic boycott. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Funatsu, the director of the Textile Industry Association in China. It is said that the meeting did not produce any concrete results and will be reconvened on Wednesday. Afterwards, Funatsu told a reporter from the newspaper that he could not accurately inform when the Japanese textile mills in China would close down and how they would close down. However, if the situation deteriorates, all the Japanese textile mills may be forced to close down one after another. Although this step is regrettable, it is inevitable if the Chinese economic boycott movement does not subside. At present, some Japanese residents in this port are strongly advising the managers of Japanese textile mills to close down the mills as a countermeasure to the Chinese economic boycott. Today (the 24th) afternoon, they also sent several representatives to ask for my opinion on this. I frankly described the current situation of each factory, but because the path to be taken requires careful consideration, I could not make any concrete statements, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Current Status of Silk Factories' Decline <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Extremely Weak Overseas Sales</p>
<p>Closures Occurring One After Another</p>
<p>There are a total of 106 silk factories in the Chinese and foreign concessions of this city. European and American factory silk sales are extremely weak. When the new silk came on the market, only thirty to forty factories reluctantly started work. The issuance of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk industry public bonds, the silk factories in the three districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai went to the custody committee to collect them, and the number reached 98%. Only one or two factories in each district did not collect them due to certain matters. However, the silk market remains sluggish. It's a drop in the bucket and does not help. Only about ten to twenty Shanghai silk factories are trying to resume work, and there are more than sixty in total. Recently, due to overseas economic instability, Japanese silk is cheap and selling strongly. White factory silk does not sell in England and France, and American merchants depress prices and purchase cheaply. The price of electric spun silk is very small, but the cost of silk is still high. Each bale must lose one to two hundred taels. In the past, there were silk cocoon leftovers sold to Japanese merchants, which could be used to make up for the losses. Since the severance of relations with Japan, the leftovers have been sluggish. The factory losses are even greater and cannot be supported. The number of factories reducing work and closing down is increasing day by day. The silk factory industry is in danger and has fallen into an irreversible situation. Currently, only thirty to forty silk factories in Shanghai are operating, and seven or eight of them are stopping and starting from time to time. Only more than twenty factories in Wuxi are operating, and most of the factories that are operating are preparing to suspend work temporarily in order to preserve their strength. The precarious situation of the silk factory industry is even more tragic.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Ninghu Municipal and County Rice Industry Association Joint Association held its fifth executive and supervisory committee regular meeting at Cuixiu at 2:00 PM yesterday. Zhu Zixiang was elected chairman, and formalities were observed. The chairman reported that the previous proposal on the illegal levy of rice donations by the Liyang County Government had been answered by the Provincial Government, stating that the Department of Civil Affairs had been instructed to investigate and verify. Also, the request submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau to allow Jiangsu rice transport ships to pass through Zhejiang had been approved by the Bureau. The Municipal Government approved the response from the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding the permission for rice boats to pass through Zhejiang, and has ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to investigate and handle the case together. Furthermore, the Changshu Rice Industry Association's request to prevent the Rice Transport Merchant Ship United Association from registering has also been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that it has requested the Public Security Bureau to order the subordinate authorities to stop the Rice Transport Merchant Ship United Association from registering and to instruct the association to submit a report on its organizational history for review. Subsequently, the Wuxi Soybean and Rice Industry Association and Committee Member Yan Xiaoquan's proposal to request investigations in various places to compare the profits and losses of this year's autumn harvest for reference was discussed. It was resolved to immediately issue investigation forms to the members present, requesting them to fill them out in detail and report to the association. The chairman temporarily proposed that the violent actions of Japan have not been resolved, and if military force is used, the food problem will be the first to be affected. Adjusting surpluses and deficits is of utmost importance. It is proposed that members of the association conduct a thorough investigation of the autumn harvest situation and submit a report to the authorities for overall planning to prepare for it. It was resolved to submit a report to the authorities after each member submits their investigation report.</p>

<p>Reply from the Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<p>Opening the sluice gate to release water and blocking the breach is not a good idea. The association recently telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangbei Canal Post-Disaster Engineering Committee to inquire whether there is such a method. The reply is as follows: Wang, Huang Cheng, and other gentlemen of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Charity Association: I have received your telegram. The dike-blocking project has already been implemented. The five major breaches can be closed next month, and there is no discussion of opening the sluice gate to release water. As for closing the Sanhekou breach, we will discuss it with the Huai River Management Committee and the Lianghuai Canal Envoy in order to save lake water to aid spring navigation and irrigation. Please release your worries. Sincerely, The Canal Engineering Post-Disaster Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Petition from Bereaved Families of Victims in the Baoshan Road Tragedy <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Demands of Two Bereaved Families</p>
<p>Declaration of Two Labor Unions</p>
<p>Since the tragedy in the fifth district of Baoshan Road on October 1st, nearly a month has passed with little news. We have obtained correspondence from the two bereaved families jointly petitioning the clothing and military uniform tailoring labor unions involved. The main points are recorded below:</p>
<p>Demands of Two Bereaved Families (1) Cai Bingquan, father of the deceased Cai Yongfang,</p>
<p>To the Tailoring Labor Union: Bingquan, 49 years old, native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, works as a shop assistant in a rice store in his hometown, earning very little. Yongfang, 22 years old, was his only son, burdened with supporting both branches of the family. Before his death, he worked at Shi Yongji Tailoring Shop in Xingye Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, for nine years, earning a monthly salary of thirty yuan. The entire family relied on the income of the father and son to support my sister-in-law, wife, daughters-in-law, and two young granddaughters. On the afternoon of October 1st at 8 pm, You Bolu, the head of the fifth district, in order to stop the unarmed masses' anti-Japanese movement, ordered the shooting, severely injuring five people and killing two. Unfortunately, my son Yongfang tragically met his fate, dying unjustly. Sadly, he was newly married and has no heir. Alas, how painful! I received a telegram and rushed to Shanghai, submitting a request to claim his body. I am endlessly grateful for the assistance of your union. However, after reading the local news in the Shanghai Shenbao newspaper on the 19th of this month regarding the District Court's handling of this case, it stated that the case must await the recovery of the injured before it can be heard. However, it will take time for the injured to recover. I am not only suffering the pain of losing my sight, but I am also staying in a foreign land with no hope of justice. Now that autumn is ending and winter is coming, my purse is empty, and I lack food and clothing, while my entire family is crying day and night, we will inevitably sit and wait for death. One person's death leads to the death of the whole family. How can I bear this scene and situation? Therefore, I earnestly request your union to sympathetically approve, find a way to send staff to guide me and accompany me to petition various government agencies, labor unions, and schools, and provide financial assistance to save us from this disaster. Both the living and the dead will be grateful. I submit this urgent plea with utmost sincerity, awaiting your response. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Tailoring Workers' Union, Cai Bingquan, father of deceased member Cai Yongfang, weeps and kowtows, October 22nd. (2) Shen Yan, mother of the deceased Shen Huilin, to the Military Uniform Labor Union: Shen Yan, 37 years old, native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, lost her husband when her son Huilin was five years old. Before his death, he worked at the Dali Military Uniform Factory on Baoshan Road, Zhabei. At home, there was a 74-year-old grandmother, a 14-year-old younger son, and a 12-year-old adopted daughter-in-law, Chen. The family relied on the deceased son for support. We hoped that he would become successful, and that after the adopted daughter-in-law grew up and married, they would have descendants to bring joy to the elderly and comfort their lives. Unexpectedly, the evil You Bolu of the fifth district, at 8 pm on October 1st, in order to stop the unarmed masses' anti-Japanese movement, ordered the shooting, causing him to die unjustly. Alas, how painful! Since her husband's death, she had endured countless hardships, raising this son to adulthood. Now, he was brutally murdered by You Bolu, wiping out all previous efforts. Since the occurrence of this case, the family's finances have been cut off. Furthermore, because of her grief over her son's death, she is distraught and barely wants to live. Now the family is suffering even more from the pressure of life, and we will inevitably sit and wait for death. On October 19th, news reports from the District Court stated that this case must await the recovery of the five injured before it can be heard. This means that there is no hope of justice. The family is crying out in hunger and suffering greatly. We earnestly implore your union to have mercy, do your best to protect us, and find a way to rescue us, or accompany me to petition various government agencies, organizations, labor unions, and schools, and seek financial assistance to extend the life of my family. This is my earnest prayer. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Military Uniform Workers' Union, Shen Yan, mother of deceased member Shen Huilin, weeps and kowtows, October 25th.</p>
<p>Declaration of Two Labor Unions: The Shanghai Tailoring and Military Uniform Workers' Unions, on behalf of the bereaved families of the Baoshan Road tragedy, tearfully appeal to all sectors of society: (omitted above) On October 1st, the fifth artillery unit posted anti-Japanese propaganda, and the guards came out to obstruct them. The guard's actions were ordered by their superiors, but You reversed protected the guard who caused the incident and indiscriminately swept bullets at patriotic protesters and civilians, causing blood and flesh to fly everywhere. The Baoshan Road tragedy was turned into a bloody massacre, and the city of unjustly dead souls suddenly added ghosts filled with grievances. At the time, the deceased Cai Yongfang (member of the Tailoring Union) and Shen Huilin (member of the Military Uniform Union), along with five injured people, were victims. Cai was an only son with no brothers, and Shen's second son was too young to earn a living. From now on, these two families will be empty, leaning on their doors and yearning, shedding tears of the western river every night. Speaking of this, how can we not be heartbroken? Alas, who doesn't have parents, fearing they won't live long? Who doesn't have a spouse? (Cai Yongfang was newly married, treating his wife as a guest and friend. What grace did he have to be born, what fault to be killed?) Since the tragedy occurred, the families of the deceased have been waiting for trial in Shanghai, crying and begging for their lives, but the court still has no date for summons. The families of the deceased are almost facing starvation. One person's death leads to the death of the whole family. You's cruelty is such that even cutting off his hair is not enough to count his crimes, and eating his flesh is not enough to wash away this hatred. If justice is not carried out soon, how can we wash away national shame and appease popular anger? We hope that all party, government, and military agencies, organizations, and schools will uphold justice, share righteous indignation, and urge the court to quickly execute the criminal, and also punish the patrol officers who opened fire according to the law, and provide compensation to the families to prevent them from starving. Then, under the nine springs, the ghosts filled with grievances can be comforted, and on the three islands, no shame will be left for the Japanese devils. This is our sincere declaration.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Hangzhou Detective Wounded in Robbery Dies Yesterday Morning <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Wife and Concubine of the Thief to be Interrogated This Morning</p>
<p>Dying in the Line of Duty is Truly Pitiable</p>
<p>The notorious thief Wu Tianbao, a native of Shaoxing, has repeatedly committed robbery and kidnapping crimes in Hangzhou and other places. He fled to Shanghai, and the Hangzhou County Public Security Bureau issued an arrest warrant for him. Based on reports from informants, Wu was hiding in Lane 1, Beidi Fang, Beidi Road, French Concession, Shanghai. The Hangzhou County Public Security Bureau prepared a document and dispatched Detective Jiang Zhongyun with informants to Shanghai. At noon the day before yesterday, they reported to the French Concession police and requested assistance in the arrest. The police chief ordered special agents Ni Jinrong and Zhao Chunsheng, along with detectives Wang Jinyu and others, to cooperate with Detective Jiang in the arrest. They entered through the back door, but Wu noticed them and ambushed at the staircase with a gun. When Detective Jiang, Ni, Zhao, and the other detectives reached the middle of the stairs, Wu opened fire downwards, shooting Detective Jiang in the throat, Detective Ni in the cheek, and a detective in the temple. They fell to the side of the stairs one after another. Wu escaped through the roof. Detective Zhao went upstairs and captured Wu's wife and concubine, confiscating a loaded handgun. They were taken to the police station for investigation. The police used cars to transport the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. This information was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after Jiang Zhongyun and others were admitted to the hospital, doctors performed surgery to treat them. Unfortunately, Jiang's injuries were too severe, and he died yesterday morning despite the rescue efforts. The hospital notified the police station, which dispatched detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fu Yuan branch morgue for an autopsy. It is reported that the deceased was 27 years old this year. The police station has notified the Hangzhou County Public Security Bureau to send personnel to Shanghai to handle the funeral arrangements. Wu's wife and concubine, who were arrested, were also sent to the court for interrogation today.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Verdict on Overseas Chinese Marriage Solicitation Case <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>All Introducers Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Xu Chen Sentenced to Fine for Assault</p>
<p>Shao Yuefeng, a native of Changzhou and director of Guangshan Hospital at 78 Xizang Road, Zhang Zhimou, a native of Guangdong, Wu Cao, a woman from Zhejiang, and Xu Chen, a woman from Jiashan, were suspected of trafficking Chen Guizhen (16 years old, a dancer at Tiandong Dance Hall) to Li Yuxuan, an overseas Chinese from Holland. Chen Yonggui, a Chinese detective from the Laoza Gate Police Station, arrested Shao and others and handed them over to the First Special District Court. Shao Yuefeng was ordered to pay a bail of 200 yuan, Xu Chen 300 yuan, and Zhang Zhimou and Wu Cao were released pending summons. This information has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jiashi of the Criminal Division of the Special Court presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that the police are now prosecuting the four defendants according to Article 257 of the Criminal Law for trafficking in persons, and additionally charging Xu Chen with Article 293 of the same law for obstruction of justice, because she injured her adopted daughter Wu Xiaomao. During the adjournment, the police inquired with the Dutch consulate, and the Dutch consul Van Dunburg replied that Li Yuxuan was indeed a widower with thirteen children at home, and his purpose for coming to Shanghai was unknown. However, Li Yuxuan did not appear in court today. Interrogated, Shao Yuefeng, Zhang Zhimou, and Wu Cao all testified that they were acting as matchmakers for Li, and there was no trafficking involved. During their testimony, Shao and Zhang addressed each other as brothers, and the sound of "brother, brother" was incessant. The police lawyer Ru interrupted them, saying that this was a court and they could not address each other as brothers. Shao and others complied, but after a short while, Shao again addressed him as brother, presumably out of habit. Interrogated, Xu Chen denied injuring Xiaomao, and said that Guizhen was her adopted daughter and she had always been very fond of her. She said that she really did not want to this time. She also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. Judge Xu verified the testimony and acquitted Shao Yuefeng, Zhang Zhimou, and Wu Cao on the spot. Xu Chen was fined sixty yuan for causing bodily harm, and acquitted of the charge of enticement. Xiaomao was sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. Shao Yuefeng, suspected of false accusation, was ordered to pay an additional bail of eight hundred yuan and sent to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Ye Jihong Still Hopes Li Caiying Will Reconsider <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Unwilling to Sever Relationship</p>
<p>Court Orders Out-of-Court Reconciliation</p>
<p>Ye Jihong, a 33-year-old Shanghai resident living at 234 Huashun Lane, Tongfu Road, who works at a gold exchange, became acquainted with Li Caiying, a woman from Changzhou, in February of last year. Recently, due to disagreements, Li hired a lawyer to accuse Ye of undermining public morals and demanded to end the relationship with Ye and return clothing and jewelry worth 3,000 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Shen Bingrong of the First Special District Court presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. According to Li Caiying's statement, her husband Sun Ruiqi was addicted to opium and did not engage in legitimate business, so she cohabitated with the defendant. Recently, he has not provided her with expenses, and he does not allow her to return to her hometown to visit her sick aunt. He said that if she wanted to return home, he would kill her. Therefore, she does not want to live with him. All the clothing and jewelry worth 3,000 yuan have been pawned. She requests the court to order their return and permanently sever the relationship. Interrogated, the defendant stated that when he cohabitated with her, it was introduced by someone. He has spent more than 8,000 yuan on her. Furthermore, his legal wife divorced him because of the plaintiff. He has treated her well in the past. Now that she is involved in litigation, she is listening to her mother's instructions. If she is determined to sever the relationship, he will file a counterclaim, accusing her of fraud. He hopes she will reconsider and continue to live with him. In short, he now regrets it and asks the court for a clear judgment. Judge Shen declared to the plaintiff that their type of case would be canceled. He then ordered both parties to reconcile outside of court and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Chen Xuchu Accused by Concubine <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Order Rescheduled for Further Investigation</p>
<p>Chen Xuchu, 40 years old, the owner of the Zhongshan Hotel on Tianjin Road, was accused of undermining public morals by Zou Zhendan, 31 years old, his concubine from Changshu, who resides at 53 and a half Puqing Lane, Fujian Road. The case was filed in the First Special District Court. The case had previously been summoned once, but Chen did not appear, resulting in a postponement. The day before yesterday, Judge Shen Bingrong continued the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. According to the plaintiff Zou Zhendan's statement, her husband's surname was Gu, and they divorced in March of the 16th year of the Republic of China due to disagreements, and he paid her 5,000 yuan for living expenses. At that time, she met Chen at a large restaurant in Shanghai, and they fell in love and began cohabitating for about three years. In the past, Chen would come to her place every other night. However, on September 21st, Chen took advantage of her absence and brought more than 20 men and women, broke down the door, and forcibly moved the redwood furniture and six clothing chests from her room, hiring a car to transport them away. At that time, neighbors, seeing that she had not returned, tried to stop them. Chen patted his chest and assured them that they could speak to him if anything happened. He had previously been tricked out of his savings account, which had not yet been returned. Liu Qiufeng, the owner of the Rongji Cigarette Paper Shop next door, testified that he personally witnessed the defendant bringing dozens of men and women to break down the plaintiff's door, move out the clothing chests and furniture, and hire a car to park at the entrance of the alley to load them up, which was indeed the case. Interrogated, Chen Xuchu stated that he was engaged in miscellaneous businesses, and the Zhongshan Hotel was owned by shareholders. He had known the plaintiff for nearly three years. Previously, he had found a photograph in her bedroom drawer, in which she was with a man. She said that the man was the godfather of her daughter, but this person was her new paramour. Therefore, he obtained this evidence and stopped giving her monthly expenses. When he went to move the items from her room, he reported it to the Laoza Gate Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives. Furthermore, all the redwood furniture was purchased by him. His lawyer presented the photograph of the plaintiff and the man for inspection. Zou Zhendan said that the redwood furniture in the room was actually bought with 400 yuan she made from working in Singapore from her friends. She denied knowing the man in the photograph. Judge Shen verified the testimony and ordered a rescheduling for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Petty Inn Owner Sentenced for Enticing a Minor <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Four Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wen Chuxi, the 20-year-old daughter of Wen Lanting, the owner of the Wen Maosheng Chicken and Duck Shop at 54 Caishi Street, French Concession, was abducted last month in collusion with Zhou Ade, the owner of the Xinsheng Petty Inn at 27 Mofang Street, and his wife Zhang. The Zhou couple were arrested by the French police detectives and handed over to the Second Special Court. Judge Ge Zhitang questioned them and ordered them to be held for further review. Yesterday, the hearing continued. Zhou Afa testified that Wen was in love with a man, who was the husband of the inn's owner, because they were sworn sisters. They exchanged gold rings in May and often went out to the cinema and opened rooms in inns. This time, it was actually Chunxi who insisted on forcing him to rent a small house outside to cohabitate with her. Later, the wife of the man found out and came to make trouble, which caused the litigation. Zhou Zhang testified that although she and Wenxi were sworn sisters, she did not know that she was having an affair with her husband. She only found out when her husband was often away from home. She did not dare to collude in the abduction. Wen Chunxi testified that although she and Zhou Zhang, also known as Ai Lin, were sworn sisters, she had no love for her husband. Ai Lin tricked her into going to her sister's place in Peiping to study, and abducted her to 7 Pingji Lane, Maithestrasse Road, where Zhou Afa forcibly raped her. Later, he tricked her out of her gold jewelry and spent it all, and wanted to force her to write a letter to her father, demanding 500 yuan. Therefore, she fled home and reported the case to the police. Next, Li Zhao, the landlady of 7 Pingji Lane, Maithestrasse Road, testified that Zhou Afa rented the floor from her at the beginning of July for 11 yuan per month, claiming that he had escaped the flood from Hankou to Shanghai. Later, on the 10th, Zhou Afa and Wen Chunxi came to live there. She mistakenly thought they were a married couple and did not know that they had been abducted. Tang Amao, the chauffeur of the Fulai Motor Car Company, and Zhang Bingsheng, Wen's brother-in-law, also testified in court to prove everything. At this point, the judge ordered the lawyers for both sides to debate. Judge Ge then announced the end of the debate and sentenced Zhou Afa to one year and six months of imprisonment for the crime of enticing a girl under the age of twenty away from the custody of her parents with the intent to commit adultery. Zhou Zhang was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for the crime of helping a person who intends to commit adultery to entice a girl under the age of twenty away from the custody of her parents. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. Zhou Zhang was given a two-year suspended sentence. During the appeal period, she was ordered to pay a bail to be available for summons. Without bail, she will be temporarily detained by the police. Wen Chunxi was taken back by her father.</p>

<p>Fine of Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Xu Changfa, the owner of the Wujin Store at 303 Fuxu Road, drove a No. 98 motorized bicycle on Aiduya Road in the French Concession in front of the Nanjing Grand Theater the day before yesterday. The vehicle emitted a large amount of thick smoke, which was discovered by No. 47 Western police officer Laobuxuelaofu. The officer determined that the defendant had violated Article 12 of the Traffic Regulations, which prohibits causing public nuisance. He recorded the license plate number and reported to the police chief. Yesterday, Xu was summoned to the Second Special Court for a summary trial. The police lawyer stated the facts of the case, and No. 47 Western police officer testified about the defendant's smoke emission situation at the time. Interrogated, Xu Changfa admitted to emitting smoke and said that all motorized bicycles emit smoke, not just his vehicle. He asked for leniency. The police lawyer said that although other vehicles emit smoke, none are as thick as the defendant's. Judge Wu sentenced Xu to a fine of ten yuan as a warning.</p>

Hou was severely injured and unable to speak. Later, an acquaintance saw him and informed his family, who carried him home. He was barely breathing. He was taken to a hospital in Shanghai for treatment. He is said to be in critical condition. The silver dollars in his pocket were still there. His family has reported the crime to the authorities and requested that the attacker be arrested and prosecuted.</p>

<p>Zhang Gendi and Wang Guibao</p>
<p>Taizhou Peddler Escapes</p>
<p>Nian Yongfa, the police chief of the pier sub-station of the First District General Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, discovered two young women at the Dada Pier in the Sixteenth Concession at around 5:00 PM yesterday who were about to board a Taizhou steamer. Observing their panicked expressions, he suspected that there was something amiss and went forward and ordered the two women to stop. When he questioned them about their background, the two women gave evasive answers. He immediately took them back to the sub-station and transferred them to the General Bureau. During the preliminary hearing, one of the women gave her name as Zhang Gendi, 16 years old, from Suzhou, currently residing in Lan Nidu, Pudong. Both her parents are alive, but her mother is a stepmother who is fierce and impetuous. If she slightly displeases her, she will be whipped. Her father witnessed it but was naturally fearful and dared not protest, so her life was like being in a living hell. She had long planned to escape this bad family, but had no opportunity. Wang Guibao (referring to the other woman) is her neighbor. Her mother has passed away, and she is now living in the hands of her stepmother. Her suffering is similar to hers. A peddler from Taizhou, Mr. Jia, often met with them, and they felt that he was kind and gentle. Therefore, they agreed to flee together the day before yesterday. At that time, she, Guibao, and Mr. Jia secretly went to Puxi. That night, they opened a room in a hotel near the Great World in the North City to stay overnight. Mr. Jia said that since they lacked a suitable place to live at the moment, they might as well go with him to his ancestral home in Taizhou to avoid being abused by their stepmothers all day long. She and Guibao heard this and thought that since there was no place to live in Shanghai, why not follow his words and start together. Therefore, they prepared to take a steamer at the Dada Pier shortly before being discovered by the police and queried. Mr. Jia, fearing that the matter would be revealed, took the opportunity to escape. They were then brought in by the police, but their families are really too bad. If they return, they fear that their stepmothers will treat them as enemies, and they will not be able to live. They beg for understanding. Wang Guibao, when questioned, said that she was 14 years old, from Pudong, and the rest of her statement was the same as Zhang Gendi's. They are being detained for investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a male corpse was found lying on the banks of Yujiawan. He was about 30 years old and wore a white cloth short shirt and trousers, which were old and worn.

<h3 id="e140">Cow and Chicken Essence Made with Cold Extraction Method <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Exclusive Management by Huada Pharmacy in This Port</p>
<p>The Shirilike brand beef essence and chicken essence from the German Marda Pharmaceutical Factory, exclusively managed by Huada Pharmacy in this port, has been increasingly popular in recent years and has spread throughout the country. After autumn, branch managers in various ports have added goods one after another, and more than ten new branch management offices have been added, resulting in a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The reason is that Shirilike brand beef essence and chicken essence are made using the cold-pressing method invented by the technicians of the Marda Pharmaceutical Factory. Extremely large easy-pressing machines are used, with the pressure inside the machine reaching more than 27,000 pounds of meat slices. After processing by this machine, the residue becomes fine powder and is separated from the original juice. The nutrients such as protein contained in the meat are not lost at all, so the efficacy is great and has a reputation that is unique in the world, and the sales volume is increasing year by year. In these two weeks, the store sent dozens of telegrams to the German factory to urge delivery. The goods shipped from the German factory also had four batches. However, the quantity of each batch was as before, so it was still insufficient to supply. Only yesterday did a large batch five times the quantity arrive in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Zhīwèi Guān Hangzhou Cuisine Restaurant, located at the entrance of Shílù Xiāngfěn Lane, was founded by a Mr. Zhāng, a dye merchant. The restaurant's dishes are mostly prepared in the Hangzhou style. Recently, a fire caused by a careless neighbor damaged the restaurant's premises, leading to a temporary closure. It is now reported that the restaurant has chosen a new location at the Shílù intersection on Dàmǎ Road for its grand reopening.

<p>Two Shanghai industrialists, Mr. Zhāng Xiàoliáng and Mr. Zhōu Xuéwén, acquired dozens of acres of land seventy miles west of Shanghai in the Sìgǎngkǒu area. They built hundreds of factory buildings and machine houses, establishing the Fúmín Rice Mill. The scale is grand, and the equipment is complete, unparalleled in the Sū, Xī, Cháng, and Hù areas. The previous typhoon blew down dozens of zhang of the corridor sheds, as well as other buildings. Mr. Zhōu immediately hired workers to repair the damage, and the mill has long since restored its former glory and resumed operations as usual. It is reported that all the milling machines in the factory were ordered from famous German factories after on-site inspections. Therefore, the rice produced is particularly bright, and the amount of bran and broken rice is also less than that of other factories. Furthermore, the mill enjoys extremely convenient water and land transportation, and the authorities have assigned military police to escort merchants from various ports who come to do business. There seems to be an overwhelming demand. Yesterday, Mr. Zhōu came to Shanghai again to discuss increasing capital and vigorously promoting the business with Mr. Zhāng Xiàoliáng, which is expected to be realized soon.</p>

<p>Hope Farmers Associations Publicize to Farmers</p>
<p>"It seems that all the people in the country know about the brutality of this violent sun, but in fact, more than 80% of the population, the farmers, are still in the dark. Although students from various schools have gone to the countryside to spread the word, their abilities are limited, and they cannot abandon their proper jobs to continue this task for a long time. I think there are many farmers' associations in various places. The gentlemen of the associations are eating and doing nothing at this time and can very well publicize this matter to the villagers. Moreover, the villagers have more faith in the gentlemen of the farmers' associations, and the effect will be even greater than that of the students whom the villagers regard as a special class."</p>

<h3 id="e151">Fundamental Methods and Policies to Be Adopted for Promoting Domestic Goods (Wú Xiàoyún) <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Our country suffers from foreign economic aggression, exceeding 120 million yuan annually. Patriotic people are all calling for the promotion of domestic goods. For over twenty years, the results have been very limited. Foreign goods still flood the market, and domestic goods remain sluggish. The reason for this is the lack of fundamental methods and policies. The Society is requesting views from fellow citizens on this topic. We have received no less than several hundred excellent works. We select and publish the best ones for the reference of the national industrial and commercial circles. The views expressed in this article are insightful. Readers can refer to the article by Mr. Lǚ Yínshēng published in the special issue of the Shēnbào Newspaper yesterday (Editor's Note). Since the nineteenth century, domestic industries in European countries have made great strides, resulting in overcapacity of production, oversupply of products, and oversupply of raw materials; the increase in capital has also exceeded the capacity of the country, so they have had to plunder colonies to obtain raw materials; seek overseas markets to sell surplus products, and further use these conquered colonies or markets, with their abundant raw materials and cheap labor, to operate various enterprises, in order to circulate the country's surplus capital and monopolize local industries and finance, thus creating the development and aggression of imperialism. Our country is vast and populous, rich in resources, and economically backward with nascent industry and commerce, and this type of market meets the needs of imperialists. Therefore, in 1840, Britain took advantage of the victory in the Opium War to force the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing. Other powers also took the opportunity to demand the signing of various unequal treaties. Since then, our country's doors have been wide open, and the powers, with the unequal treaties as a protective talisman and the power of gunboat diplomacy, have greatly expanded their ambitions for economic aggression. In recent years, according to customs reports, the annual trade deficit is often around 100 million taels, and the profits earned by domestic and foreign merchants operating various enterprises are also no less than 100 million. Such leakage has led to the dangerous situation of economic bankruptcy, impoverishment of the people, widespread banditry, and years of disasters in our country today. People with insight all believe that the promotion of domestic goods is the only good policy to resist economic aggression and save the country from danger. However, what are the fundamental methods for promoting domestic goods? And what policies should be adopted? The author is not talented, but lists several major points as follows, hoping that the whole country will work together with one heart and one mind!</p>
<p>1. Social Stability</p>
<p>Consider the countries of Europe and America, and our eastern neighbor Japan, the basis of their national wealth and strength lies in the two major foundations of industrial development and enlightened politics. However, the prerequisite for building these two major foundations must be social stability, because social stability is the mother of construction. Once society is stable, any plan can be realized; otherwise, even construction will be in vain. Since the late Qing Dynasty, up to recent years, our country's situation has been precarious, with internal troubles and external threats, and there has been no year of peace. This phenomenon is caused by the instability of society. In these decades, the people of the country have not attempted to develop various undertakings, but what have been the achievements? What has been the result? The past is still there, and it is not difficult to review. Therefore, to stabilize the country internally and resist external forces, we must first seek to stabilize society. Once society reaches a state of stability, the power of construction will be easily and fully utilized, and the development of industry and the revitalization of domestic goods can be expected soon.</p>
<p>2. Abolition of Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>The reason why our people's livelihood is so depleted and our industry is so backward is due to the gift of unequal treaties. Imperialists use these treaties to plunder our raw materials and monopolize our markets: In particular, the clause "determining that China shall not freely increase tariffs" has put our industry and commerce in an irrecoverable situation. During the European War, the powers had no time to attend to it, and our industry and commerce temporarily showed signs of recovery. But after the end of the European War, the powers came east again with their strong economies to confront our country, but the result was not only no progress, but a disastrous defeat. The reason for this failure should be attributed to the monopoly of foreign merchants in China. If society is stable and the powers have no excuse, then it will be easy for the whole country to work together to abolish the unequal treaties. Once these treaties are abolished, foreign merchants will lose their reliance, tariffs will be controlled by us, and domestic industries will be able to develop independently, and foreign trade can also be controlled by us. With our country's vast territory and abundant resources, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's method of "catching up with Western civilization," the development of our country's industry will be like the Yangtze River rushing thousands of miles, and the problem of people's livelihood will be solved easily, not just the promotion of domestic goods.</p>
<p>3. Development of Resources and Improvement of Transportation</p>
<p>A country's industry and commerce flourish in an environment free from internal strife and external troubles, and its progress depends on the convenience of transportation and the supply of raw materials, which go hand in hand. If one is lacking, then industry and commerce will rarely be able to develop fully. If Japan did not have coal, iron, and grain from the three eastern provinces, Japan's national defense, transportation, and even various undertakings would suffer greatly. If Britain did not have cotton from India and wool from Australia, then Britain's textile industry would be completely paralyzed. However, if the raw materials in these two places were not transported by trains and ships reaching all directions, the impact would be the same as having no raw materials. It is more difficult to seek the supply of raw materials than to seek convenient transportation, so in countries with developed industry and commerce, transportation is convenient, and the only worry is that raw materials cannot be self-sufficient. Our country is blessed by nature, and it has all the raw materials that industry needs. It is only because transportation is obstructed that they cannot be fully developed. In normal times, we can still rely on others, but if war breaks out and the source is cut off, wouldn't we be sitting and waiting for death? Writing this, I can't help but shudder! If the people of the country do not want to promote domestic goods, then so be it, otherwise, making efforts to improve transportation in order to develop resources is an urgent plan that must be taken. As for how to improve transportation and how to develop resources, Dr. Sun Yat-sen speaks in great detail in the Industrial Plan, so there is no need to repeat it.</p>
<p>The three major fundamental policies described above cannot be handled in a day or two. They can only be gradually realized after the country's strength is sufficient. Before the country's strength is sufficient, we cannot but prepare the following policies that are easy to implement to promote domestic goods, so as to lay the foundation for future development. 1. Training Talents</p>
<p>The employees of industry and commerce in the East and the West, from small workers and shop assistants to engineers and general managers, all have considerable talents to fulfill their responsibilities. This kind of talent is formed by peacetime training, so industry and commerce are making progress every day and without end. The reason why our country's industry and commerce cannot catch up quickly is not the lack of talents, but the lack of training for talents. Because the original talents are often used in positions unrelated to their studies, these talents have neglected their studies for a long time, and once they enter practical work, they want to use their strengths in the positions they hold, but because they have no considerable training in peacetime, they can only grope in the dark, which reduces work efficiency. How can we expect rapid industrial and commercial development in this way? Therefore, training talents is the first preparation for developing our industry and commerce.</p>
<p>2. Concentrating Capital</p>
<p>The reason why our country's manufacturers cannot win against foreign-funded manufacturers is mostly due to the fact that the capital is too small and the scale is too small. Since the economic ability is insufficient, there is naturally no large-scale production and great business. It is inevitable that they will be oppressed by foreign capital. Therefore, to seek the development of industry and commerce and the revitalization of domestic goods, we must concentrate a large amount of capital. Not only can we compete with foreign capital, but large-scale production can save a lot of artificial power construction and other expenses compared to small-scale production. This method is very suitable for our country's economic situation, and we hope to take action quickly.</p>
<p>3. Improving and Imitating</p>
<p>The reason why domestic goods are not as exquisite as foreign goods is not that the brains of the Chinese people are weaker than those of foreigners, but that the Chinese people are sticking to the old ways and failing to use scientific methods to improve them. In recent years, although the people of the country have spared no effort to promote domestic goods, there seems to be little progress in improving the goods. Even with silk and tea, which were the main exports of our country twenty years ago and occupied an important position in overseas markets, they have been squeezed out by Britain and Japan because they did not know how to improve them. Other things such as porcelain and silk are also declining. The plan to save them is to engage in improvement in order to achieve the effect of promotion. As for the necessities that are not unique to our country, we should actively imitate them. In terms of quantity, we must strive to be self-sufficient and no longer rely on others. If this is really the case, the leakage can be reduced, and foreign goods can be resisted.</p>
<p>4. Encouragement and Assistance</p>
<p>It is difficult to expect any undertaking to flourish without encouragement and assistance, and industry and commerce are no exception. The countries of the East and the West give comprehensive encouragement and assistance to their own industry and commerce, such as holding large-scale expositions, establishing industrial exhibition halls everywhere, increasing import taxes on foreign goods without restriction, making efforts to reduce export taxes on domestic goods, providing economic and technical assistance to private enterprises, and using all possible means to restrict and oppress foreign-funded manufacturers. All these are protection policies for their own industry and commerce. Our country cannot fully implement the protection policies described above before the unequal treaties are abolished. We are doing our best to encourage and fully assist within the possible range, so that people know the importance of developing industry and foster a psychology of being ashamed of using foreign goods. With this policy, it is not difficult to promote domestic goods. 5. Industrial and Commercial Integrity</p>
<p>"Merchants value profit and despise integrity," is the saying that used to despise merchants. It is more true today, as among the merchants, there are those who only know how to seek profit and disregard integrity, such as those who collude with foreign merchants to pass off imported goods as local products, those who use shareholders' capital to engage in speculative undertakings, those who disregard shareholders' interests and only seek personal pleasure, and those who adulterate inferior quality products as soon as their products gain social credibility in order to seek profits. As a result, I don't know how many manufacturers have closed down. It seems that not only is industrial and commercial integrity swept away, but the future of domestic goods is also greatly affected. However, there are also many examples of those whose business is booming because of taking care of integrity, such as the China Chemical Industry Society and the Three Friends Industrial Society, which have a history of twenty years, and all of them are "honest and un欺". If our country's manufacturers want their business to develop and last for a long time, they must pay attention to industrial and commercial integrity.</p>
<p>6. Labor-Capital Cooperation</p>
<p>The content of our country's labor problem is extremely complicated, and if handled carelessly, it will cause great disputes. In recent years, although the labor and capital sides seem to be at peace on the surface, the prejudices are deep. If it is not completely resolved, the loss to our country's industrial circles will be great. At this time when the country is in dire straits and the promotion of domestic goods is actively underway, how should the labor and capital sides understand each other and work together to develop industry and strengthen the country? Is this not only beneficial to both labor and capital?</p>
<p>7. Field Investigation</p>
<p>Closing the door to build a car may not fully meet the needs of the world: It may not be fully suitable for the use of various places in terms of manufacturing goods. Therefore, field investigation is still in need. The reason why foreign goods can cater to the tastes of the Chinese people and flood our markets is the result of foreigners coming to China to investigate. The reason why our country's native products are gradually declining overseas and almost completely replaced by foreign goods at home is that they are ignorant of the importance of investigation. From now on, if we want to develop native products abroad and resist foreign goods at home, we must send personnel to conduct field investigations. We must conduct thorough research and statistics on the social situation, the psychology of the people, and the quality and quantity of the products sold before we can gallop the business arena and victory can be manipulated, as the saying goes: Know yourself and your enemy, and you will win every battle.</p>
<h3 id="e152">A General Overview and Suggestions for the Development of China's Seasoning Industry (By Ms. Kang Pei-ying) <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>In China, the first seasoning product was the Ajinomoto from Japan. Almost every Chinese person knows about it. It rampaged through the Chinese market for twenty years, and the outflow of our money was countless. Later, domestic factories were established one after another to manufacture this product in order to resist it. Those that have achieved success include the Guanyin Powder from China Chemical Industry Society, the Hehe Powder from Gentai Factory, the Wuweisu from Defeng Factory, the Weijing from Tianchu Factory, and the Weimu from Tianyi Factory, all of which have achieved great success. But it is a pity to say that although these factories have worked hard for many years, shouting themselves hoarse to promote and publicize in order to resist foreign goods, they have only achieved the current slight success. However, their products still cannot be sold all over the country, especially in the northeastern provinces. On the one hand, the factories' capabilities are weak, and they cannot arouse the attention of the Chinese people; on the other hand, the Chinese people cannot shirk the blame for not promoting them! However, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. Now is the era of great competition. I sincerely hope that the factories and the Chinese people will quickly pay attention, do their best to promote them, and purchase domestic goods in groups. The winning ticket is still in our hands after all.</p>
<p>Speaking of seasoning powder, it is a fine powder, white in color and delicious in taste. It dissolves in water and can increase the umami flavor of all kinds of vegetables several times. In today's increasingly high-cost of living, everything is expensive, and fish, meat, and vegetables are no exception. Therefore, to solve the problem of diet and save money, seasoning powder came into being. Using a little seasoning powder in dishes can turn them into exquisite and delicious dishes, which can both increase appetite and solve economic problems. It is truly a win-win situation. Therefore, now almost every restaurant, big or small, and every household, upper, middle, or lower class, uses this product. It has undoubtedly become an indispensable item for daily use.</p>
<p>Since seasoning powder occupies such an important position in the national production, then we cannot but pay attention to its future when this seasoning powder shows some promise.</p>
<p>Since the increase in the price of gold, the price of Ajinomoto has soared. In the southern provinces, because domestic seasoning powder is cheap and good, and its influence is strong, Ajinomoto has been greatly affected, and its business has plummeted. However, the Japanese are unusually cunning. Seeing that our Chinese people like to use domestic goods, if this continues, how can Ajinomoto stand? Therefore, they racked their brains to find ways to issue several other kinds of seasoning powder, such as Bai Ge Pai Wei Hua, Xiang Jun Pai seasoning powder, etc., all pretending to be Chinese goods, making a lot of advertisements, in order to pass off fish eyes as pearls and disrupt the market. However, unexpectedly, several of our domestic seasoning powder factories jointly published a newspaper to deny it. As a result, the paper tiger was exposed, and it was still difficult to stay in the southern provinces. Therefore, they had to change their direction and proceed from the Northeast, using their special influence in the northeastern provinces and the South Manchuria Railway Affiliated Areas to invade everything. Fortunately, domestic products such as Guanyin Powder from China Chemical Industry Society and Weimu from Tianyi Factory had already achieved great success in sales in the northeastern provinces earlier. However, the competition between domestic seasoning powder and Japanese goods in the Northeast is becoming increasingly fierce! The Japanese believe that the Northeast is the base of Ajinomoto and other products. How can they allow others to snore beside their bed? Sure enough, Ajinomoto has planned to set up a factory in Fengtian to manufacture and advertise extensively, greatly reducing its price. Recently, they held a few days of parade advertising in Tianjin, which can be said to be a grand event. The purpose is nothing more than to wipe out our domestic seasoning powder in one fell swoop. Their scheming is truly extreme. However, in view of the current crisis, we feel that we cannot care so much about the matter. Therefore, I personally advocate that at this time of close combat, we must have a life-or-death battle. On the one hand, we ourselves try our best to improve the products and find ways to lower prices. On the other hand, we also hope that the Chinese people will assist, promote, and advocate!

<h3 id="e153">Bamboo Branch Lyrics on Samsung Brand Products (Father) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the national cosmetic products on the sea have risen like a storm, dazzling the eyes. However, most of them are of inferior quality and adulterated, falsely claiming profits. It is rare to find those who can manufacture excellent products and match the name with the reality. Based on my daily purchasing experience, the various products of the Samsung brand produced by the China Chemical Industry Society on Henan Road are the most popular among Chinese people. Now, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the society, I write a short poem based on my love for the society's products to introduce them.</p>
<p>Whose product is the best for brushing teeth? Samsung's national product is toothpaste. A handful of warm grease is fragrant on the cheeks, and the taste is even more abundant in the mind.</p>
<p>Samsung toothpaste. The fragrance is sweet and delicious, refreshing. Once you try it, you will love it. It is not only the fragrance of the teeth and cheeks. If you don't believe me, please try it.</p>
<p>The jade face and ice muscles are too weak to withstand the soft snow cream. If you teach them to be regularly cared for in winter and summer, you will not be afraid of wind, frost, and scorching sun.</p>
<p>Soft snow cream. It has special effects to protect the skin. The tender face is moisturizing, suitable for both winter and summer. The beautiful room and fragrant boudoir should be prepared regularly. The smoke brand Samsung is of the best quality. The mosquito killing effect is trustworthy. Once I bought the famous incense, I didn't need to hang the Eight Treasures tassels.</p>
<p>Samsung mosquito incense. The mosquito killing effect is particularly effective, even better than imported products. A pillar of Qingxiao, comfortable sleep. There is no need to hang tassels and brocade curtains, which is suffocating.</p>
<p>The greasy jade deceives the flowers and does not return to the group. A bowl of fragrant snow is evenly divided. A Nong was born with many freckles, and the beautiful quality has changed into colorful clouds.</p>
<p>Fragrant snow. The quality is pure and the function is to remove freckles and spots. It is easy to change ugliness into beauty. Every fashionable girl must have it.</p>
<p>Loose hair is tested for evening makeup. The fragrance of jasmine is divided into the mirror. Ask what kind of things do you rely on for nourishment? There is Samsung hair cream.</p>
<p>Hair cream and jasmine hair growth oil are both wonderful products for hair care. The fragrance is moisturizing, and the light can be mirrored. Those who pay attention to hair beauty must be prepared.</p>
<p>Vegetarian food is originally the most hygienic. Salt plum treats and nourishes Hao Diaogeng. If you teach Zuoqu Guanyin powder, the delicious taste should be surprised.</p>
<p>Guanyin powder. The function is to taste, vegetarian food is the most suitable. Summer seasoning is essential.</p>
<p>Cleverly filled with perfume paper, it is easy to pick up and be charming. Why worry about sweat and dirt contaminating the pink cheeks? Yan Hong"s twist is overwhelming.</p>
<p>Perfume paper is convenient to carry. Wiping the skin and sweat is wonderful. It is suitable for people who pay attention to hygiene.</p>
<p>Who is the most effective in removing dirt and dirt? Samsung plain soap has a miraculous effect. The pure land of Zen is unimpeded. It is like the difference between grease and grease. Delicious dishes are treasures on the table. Yu Chu first tried soy sauce essence. A few drops are really economical. The wonderful juice is originally a hundred times more pure.</p>
<p>Hundredfold soy sauce essence. It is the best product for seasoning. Summer vegetarian food is especially indispensable.</p>
<p>Science is prosperous and there are many chemicals. Visit the cosmetics industry. Remember Qinghai Henan Road. Choose clearly and don't deceive yourself.</p>
<p>China Chemical Industry Society. The head office is located at No. 444, Henan Road, Shanghai. Choose your friends. Identify the brand. So as not to be wrong. (Chun'an Post Office, Zhejiang)</p>
<h3 id="e154">Short Story: Sister (Wang Ji-huang) <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Since I left my hometown and came to Hangzhou, unknowingly, seven or eight years have passed. What makes me the most reluctant and miss day and night is my parents and my sister.</p>
<p>Sister, her name is Ying; she looks very lovable. At that time, she was about to graduate from the elementary school near my home. Her singing and dancing, and her daily grades, were the best in the whole school. Therefore, she was praised by relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Recently, I went home, and I wrote a letter in advance to tell them when I could get home. Father had just gone out on business and had not returned. My mother, she was already leaning on the door and looking out. When I got out of the car, under the pressure of two kinds of emotions, unspeakable joy and soreness, I very hard called out, "Mom!" Mother smiled at me with tears in her eyes. I knew that Mother saw her son, who had been away from her lap for a long time, return home one day. Of course, there was a kind of stimulating disturbance in her mood. In a flash, my sister quickly jumped out of the door and still called me "Brother!" like a child in the past, and immediately dragged my hand towards the inside. Mother followed behind us, taking care of the coachman carrying my luggage. ···My sister is more and more beautiful, and her height is almost catching up with me." I sat and chatted with my mother, and my sister sat beside my mother. When she heard me praise her beauty, two red clouds flew on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Mother said: "Ying has been having toothaches recently. She has lost a lot of weight. Originally, her body was even stronger····".</p>
<p>Then my sister couldn't wait to say to me, "Yes! Toothaches sometimes make it impossible to sleep. And I still pay attention to hygiene and brush my teeth three times a day. Brother, look! How yellow and ugly my teeth are. What can I do?"</p>
<p>"Then why don't you use Samsung toothpaste? It's much better than ordinary toothpaste and tooth powder. It's cheap and it's a national product. Using it can make your teeth white and eliminate the danger of toothaches and cavities forever."</p>
<p>My sister used Samsung toothpaste according to my words for less than a few days, and the toothache stopped, and the tooth color also became white, and happily ran to thank me. I said, "Why do you thank me? You go thank China Chemical Industry Society! You take the heart of gratitude to me or to do more to introduce."</p>

<h3 id="e158">The Vocational Education Society Has Set Anti-Japanese National Salvation Measures <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>(1) Never use Japanese goods (2) Vigorously implement military training</p>
<p>(3) Vigorously implement nationalist education</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded and plundered the Northeast, the staff of the China Vocational Education Society have organized an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and the work is tense. The national salvation plan has been formulated and has been notified to all affiliated institutions to strictly abide by it. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, this time the Japanese army occupied our Northeast in vain, burning, looting, and killing, which is inhumane. All those with blood and spirit are deeply saddened. The office of the society recently held a meeting to discuss and decide on the Anti-Japanese National Salvation measures. First, never use Japanese goods; second, vigorously implement military training; third, vigorously implement nationalist education. Half a month ago, the outlines of the anti-Japanese national salvation work discussed by all parties were roughly the same. However, in the implementation, the plan must be precise, the time must be lasting, and the effectiveness must be significant. Although the current plan is a stopgap measure to deal with the immediate situation, the fundamental solution is also here. The colleagues of our Vocational Education Society have been serving the society for many years, and in the face of the national crisis,</p>
<p>we should further promote the spirit of safeguarding the country and protecting the nation, and be the vanguard for the youth and the people. Regarding the item of not using Japanese goods, the specific plan agreed upon by the Shanghai Education Community National Salvation Federation is relatively complete and can be adopted. The badge and badge have been made, and you only need to collect, fill in, and pay for them. The procedures are very simple. Regardless of the institution, it is hoped that it will be implemented uniformly from today. However, it is essential to choose a day to convene an oath. The institutions in this city plan to choose a suitable time to hold it at the China Vocational School. All staff, teachers, students, and workers will gather at the same time. Those who are not in this city should also hold it separately. After the holding, it is hoped that the number of people who take the oath will be sent to the office of the society for statistics. Regarding military training, the regulations of the Xu Gongqiao Improvement Zone Youth Service Corps should be used as the basis. Except for girls' schools, it is hoped that the rural improvement zones and rural primary schools will implement it appropriately. The schools in the urban area should step up military training, not only imparting the equivalent military technology, but also cultivating the habit of abiding by laws and disciplines and valuing integrity. If it is done gradually and persistently, even if the problem of the three eastern provinces is resolved in the future, it should not be slackened in the slightest. As for the youth in all the supplementary schools, most of them already have jobs, and they can be appropriately added to the volunteer team for training. The responsible personnel should plan it on their behalf. Regarding vigorously implementing nationalist education, the first is to clarify the national shame and respect the national character, so that they can deeply understand the relationship between the country and the individual, and the thoughts of safeguarding the country and protecting the nation and the feelings of public-mindedness and righteousness will be revealed in their hearts from time to time. It is fair and reasonable to be friendly to those who are good to us and to be enemies to those who insult us. Now that the Japanese militarists have brutally treated us, we should be determined to avenge our shame and regard Japan as the only target. All schools, all improvement zones, and all places should pay attention to this point when implementing school education and social education. The specific measures are in the plan proposed by the Zhejiang Education Department, which can be fully adopted. The original plan was published in the Shanghai Newspaper Education News column on September 29 of this year. I hope you will check it. The national situation is in danger, and as for this extreme, all of us who are in charge of education should bear the corresponding responsibility. From now on, we should all deeply repent, change our past mistakes, wash away the sloppy style, and arouse the spirit of Pingdan, set an example for ourselves, guide the youth, save the country from danger together, and complete our personal duties. Ten years of training can avenge us. If one thing is done in a perfunctory manner, it is misleading the country. This is what I want to say with tears, and I hope to encourage each other with the loving colleagues of our society. Two copies of the specific implementation plan for Anti-Japanese National Salvation and the allocation of work, two papers of the specific plan for economic severance of relations with Japan, ○ papers of the blank voluntary book for not using Japanese goods, two copies of the regulations of the Xu Gongqiao Rural Improvement Zone Youth Service Corps, and two papers of the chronology of Japanese political aggression against China are attached. I hope you will check and collect them for future use. To: Jiang Hengyuan and Yang Weiyu, Office of the China Vocational Education Society, 20, 10, 18.</p>

<h3 id="e159">YMCA Football Match and Jinan Suffers Poisonous Hands for the First Time <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Defeated by Scott 2-3</p>
<p>The Jinan football team was in a headwind position and was oppressed by a strong enemy. From the first half, each team had the same number of goals. In the second half, it dropped to 2 to 2 and was defeated by Scott. Yesterday, 7,000 spectators at the Yiyuan Stadium regretted it. This is the first time that the Jinan team has encountered poisonous hands in the YMCA group competition.</p>
<h3 id="e160">| Scott's Lineup | <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>

<p>| Jinan's Environment is Bad |</p>
<p>Jinan and Scott are evenly matched rivals in the YMCA. Observing the situation of both sides yesterday, Jinan was really under the control of an unfortunate environment. (1) Goalkeeper Wen Dingxin is extremely talented. The reporter can predict that he will definitely become a master in the future. However, from the beginning to the success, Jinan will inevitably suffer a little loss because of this. For the sake of the future, it is also worthwhile. (2) Qiu Dongyan has the demeanor of a general. Chen Zhenhe is a capable companion. It is best to rest when his physique is not healthy, otherwise it will delay the big things, such as yesterday. (3) Luo Haiguang uses his strength improperly, with the disadvantage of being excessive or insufficient. It is better to change to the right inner than to be in the middle. When Jinan's troops pressed on the enemy's door in the first half, they missed many opportunities, which was regrettable. Scott initially succumbed to the human power, guarding the important passes and waiting calmly. Once the wind came, the whole army sang the march, and the front and back were consistent, impeccable, and a strong enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Fierce Jinan Advances and Presses the Enemy's Territory <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>| Shows the True Colors of a Hero |</p>
<p>As soon as the war clouds opened, Jinan led the troops to attack. Qiu Dongyan kicked diagonally, Chen Zhenhe followed up, Mei Hongbao forced a corner kick, Mei kicked it in front of the goal, Qiu Dongyan headed it forward, and Luo Haiguang kicked it backwards, only a foot away. Chen Zhenhe came again, Qiu Dongyan broke through from the crowd and kicked it out, passing over the goal post. The brave and invincible Jinan pressed on the enemy's territory several times, creating a beautiful situation. The only regret is that the shooting skills are not good.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Fu Hexuan Did Not Fail His Mission <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>| Jiang Shanjing Created |</p>
<p>Scott succumbed for a while, and then gradually cheered up. The right part performed very well, and the center forward was even more stubborn and invincible. He invaded several times, and finally, with the firmness of the left Feng and the right Jiang, he bowed his head and left. At 30 minutes, Mei Hongbao kicked a corner, and Qiu and Fu kicked the door weakly and were rescued. Jiang Shanjing suddenly rushed out, running into the enemy's formation. Scott's center defender went to resist, and the ball hit his arm, a penalty free kick. The ball went to the left, and the goalkeeper came to the rescue himself, but fell to the ground empty. With a thunderous roar, Fu Hexuan did not fail his mission and hit the ball into the door, opening the record.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Flowers Blooming on Hamilton's Head <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>丨Luo Haiguang's Mistake丨</p>
<p>In a flash, the enemy attacked and also got a free kick. Zhuang Shihong snatched the ball away, but Luo Haiguang, without asking why, kicked it out, rashly passing it to the enemy, Dai Lu. The ball went straight towards the goal, where their center forward, Hamilton, met it with his head, scoring a header. Each side scored one goal, all within just two minutes. Subsequently, Shi Guide was startled and rushed far out of the goal, leaving the goal wide open. Fortunately, James headed the ball out in time, and then Jinan's goalkeeper Wen, saving the ball, went outside the penalty area, incurring a penalty kick. Although the kick didn't score, it was still a shock. At that time, Jinan's formation was formidable, seemingly having the ability to win easily, but alas, their final shot lacked strength. In the first half, each side scored one goal.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Western Team Unleashes Power with Fake Wind Force <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>丨Chorus March丨</p>
<p>Starting in the second half, Shi Guide unleashed great power with "fake wind force", invading en masse. Initially, Jiang saved it, then Tian Qiu to Fu, and then another shot went in. The right wing couldn't catch up in time; otherwise, capturing the flag and taking the pass would have been very easy. The ball went towards Jinan, and Wen Dingxin saved the situation three times, showing great tension. The enemy was unified inside and out, singing a chorus march, forming a siege. A one-sided situation immediately appeared. Jinan's entire army mostly retreated back inside the pass to cope. Wen Dingxin nearly became the target of all attacks, but fortunately, he didn't yield to the pressure, holding the line without loss. Then, at fifteen minutes, Brandt scored three consecutive goals, unexpectedly succeeding, making it two to one, which Wen hadn't anticipated.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Hamilton Reaps the Benefits <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>丨Wen Dingxin's Regret丨</p>
<p>At this time, Jinan collapsed like an avalanche. Although resistance still had strength, attacking felt disappointing. The center forward was changed from Chen Zhenhe to Hu Ran, bringing vigor, but Qiu and Luo, two inside players, one was sick and the other exhausted. With two missing out of five, how could a team be formed? Thus, the enemy became even more valiant, and Jinan seemed increasingly dangerous. At that time, Wen Dingxin was full of courage, tackling the enemy, and he recovered the ball many times, but then he repeated the same mistake, stepping out of bounds, incurring a penalty kick. The center forward Hamilton saw the key point and with a fierce kick, he reaped the benefits, taking the lead with three to one.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Feng Yunyou Overjoyed <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>丨Striving for Glory for Jinan丨</p>
<p>Jinan had no energy, losing two goals in a row, and with little time left, there was little hope. However, Jinan is Jinan because it has a spirit of perseverance. Feng Yunyou volunteered, changing to center back, determined to fight the strong enemy to the death. Fu on the left wing seized an opportunity to advance along the edge, taking a shot. The goalkeeper caught it but dropped it again. Luo Haiguang arrived too late. At forty minutes, Feng Yunyou, 25 yards from the enemy goal, used his powerful foot to attempt a shot, succeeding with one kick, overjoyed, making it two to three. Jinan's morale suddenly increased, seemingly about to create a draw, but time was not on their side, and they ultimately failed with two to three.</p>

<p>The Voice of Anti-Japanese Resistance</p>
<p>— Cai Liang</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese newspaper Shanghai Daily News published a headline saying that our people's organized "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association" is a "gang of robbers." I felt both hate and laughter when I saw it. The hate is that our country has reached the point of unbearable suffering, yet we still cannot fight them to the death. Even our people's "economic severance," implemented with shame and endurance, is subject to ridicule and abuse by others. The laughter is that the self-proclaimed violent Japanese are using the tone of a shrew scolding in the street towards our non-violent resistance of non-cooperation. Isn't that too useless? So, as I see it, as long as we carry out the work of boycotting Japanese goods seriously, I'm afraid it won't be long before we make the Japanese reach a dead end.</p>

<p>Science should be a tool for nurturing and protecting people, not a weapon for harming and killing. Edison was hired by the US government during the European War to engage in special research. Edison himself said he did 45 inventions for the government; the government announced only 39, and it is unknown whether the remaining six are secret or if there was a mistake in the number. But based on these 39, most are for preventing and avoiding harm from the enemy. He created various defensive machines to subdue German submarines, much like how Mozi resisted Gongshu Ban's cloud ladder in the past.</p>
<p>According to the New York Times on June 24, 1923, the capital invested in Edison's inventions and the businesses they spawned in the United States alone was 15 billion US dollars (15,000,000,000 US dollars), equivalent to approximately 75 billion Chinese currency, almost equal to one-fifth of the pure gold mined in the Americas since Columbus's discovery.</p>
<p>The previous industrial revolution was due to the invention of the steam engine; the next industrial revolution will rely on the invention of the electric motor. At the beginning of this electrical century, there are several immortal electricians, among whom the most worthy of our respect are Faraday, the inventor of the electric motor, and Edison, the master of electricity who passed away a few days ago.</p>

<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>Professor Peng Wenyu of Northeastern University escaped from the Japanese iron heels and returned south. Our school's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association specially invited him to give a lecture. After listening, I picked up some points to share with this publication.</p>
<p>After the Japanese soldiers occupied Shenyang, they brutally killed the innocent. A coolie was killed on the road. His wife, regarding him as her lifelong support, wailed over his body. A Japanese soldier passed by and saw it, kicking her to stop her from crying. The woman couldn't stop crying due to grief, and the soldier smiled sinisterly for a while, then his bestiality arose. He raised his gun and shot her. The woman immediately stopped crying, following her husband to the afterlife. The soldier then swaggered away. Someone saw four or five people lying on a bed, seemingly asleep, but upon closer inspection, they were all curled up in pools of blood. This proves that even if we don't resist, they will still devour us like ravenous beasts. At that time, the banknotes of Fengtian were like waste paper. Merchants refused to accept them, and the possessions of the poor were all this waste paper. Since the waste paper couldn't be exchanged for grain, they clamored in the market. The soldiers had an excuse to act. Under the guise of maintaining order, they slaughtered corpses filling the market. Alas, the people of Liaoning were the first to suffer the misery of being slaves of a conquered nation.</p>
<p>After the disaster struck, the faculty and students of Northeastern University scattered. However, there were still many who were caught off guard and unable to escape. A certain principal of a Chinese school established by the Japanese in Shenyang went to meet with Secretary of Northeastern University, Mr. So-and-so, being extremely attentive. He said that his country's rash dispatch of troops caused an accident for your school, interrupting your studies, which he deeply regretted. However, politics and military affairs are irrelevant to those of us who run education. Your school need not worry too much and can continue classes as usual. The secretary replied that the power of the oppressors was formidable, and the school's funds were all in the bank, blocked by the soldiers and unable to be withdrawn. The Japanese principal then said that he was friendly with the commander here, Honjo, and would intercede to help your school. He would return with</p>

<p>— Yi Yuan</p>
<p>October 18th of the 20th year (of the Republic). It was just a month since the Shenyang Incident, and war clouds were brewing in East Asia. The League of Nations was hoarse from mediating. Suddenly, another tragic news came, and the world mourned the collapse of a mountain. If people could be redeemed, who could call back his soul? Why did Heaven not pity and took away such a talent? Examining the glorious history of Mr. Edison, Ohio was his old hometown. The great inventor Edison's talent and fame spread far and wide. He devoted his life to science, disdaining worldly fame and fortune. Thus, he was able to strive and become a unique hero, his scientific achievements rivaling the work of nature. Sound and light have already been revealed in their mysteries, and electricity is especially infinitely useful. Modern transportation devices rely on his cultivation to flourish. Whether soaring in the sky or landing, his skills are amazing and unparalleled. He enjoyed a great age of eighty-four, his life full of extraordinary creations. From now on, North American electrical factories will continue to display his famous name. (Edison Electric Plant is globally known) Effort can always turn the tide, only devotion can accomplish great things. He always used this to instruct his disciples. May our countrymen not disregard this. Even now, the three islands are aggressive, and victory still requires scientific attack. Drive out the fog of Chiyou with cars, and turn back the wind of Red Cliff with fire. Alas, our Confucians are too indolent, and education is just beginning to enlighten them. Don't shed tears of Xinting in times of worry, raise a glass of wine to commemorate him by the river. (Response to Reimbursement)</p>
<p>good news the next day. After he left, he never returned. His visit was not to help us, but merely to keep us from stopping our studies, in order to publicize to the world, to show the tranquility of the Northeast, hoping to cover up their tyranny. How cunning are the Japanese slaves!</p>
<p>Those who remained at Northeastern University, trapped under iron heels, were startled several times a night, with disaster striking at any time. They decided to escape immediately to avoid making meaningless sacrifices, all wearing coarse cloth clothes, looking like poor people. After boarding the Beining freight train, they all celebrated their rebirth. But halfway, they suddenly heard that the train in front had been chased and attacked by Japanese planes. The train they were on had also left Shenyang not long ago and was immediately ambushed by Japanese soldiers and bandits. Panic rose again, and they all thought they would become ghosts beyond the pass. The train sped through the terror, and only after crossing the Shanhaiguan Pass did it enter safe territory. Everyone raised their hands in joy, comforting and encouraging each other, saying, "As long as we keep our lives, we will sharpen our swords to kill the enemy."</p>
<p>General Zhang ceded the rivers and mountains, and the people of the country cannot forgive him. In fact, Zhang was upright and righteous when dealing with the Northeast in peacetime. In negotiations with Japan, he often said, "Diplomacy is a matter for the central government. I will take the central government's intentions as my own." Therefore, the cunning Japanese, wanting to act at their own convenience in order to steal benefits, were often blocked by Zhang and unable to succeed, thus harboring resentment in their bones. Once, Japan threatened to invite Zhang to drink, with warriors lying in ambush in the next room. During the drinking, Japan took out a secret treaty and forced Zhang to agree. When he refused, the warriors all came out, pointing their guns at him. Zhang shouted for his guards, who held their guns and confronted them. Zhang then said, "Leave," and the guards escorted him away. The Japanese stared in shock, watching him leave, unable to do anything. From this, we can see that this time's non-resistance was probably a last resort after weighing the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e174">A Good News from the Chorus of Resisting Enemy Goods <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— He Pengfei</p>
<p>Because our country has suffered the bullying of the brutal Japanese, the people, driven by patriotic zeal, have launched a boycott of enemy goods. Theoretically speaking, this action can indeed strike a fatal blow to the Japanese. However, our country has boycotted enemy goods several times, so why hasn't it achieved good results? In reality, it only makes a few unscrupulous merchants richer. This is naturally due to the people's lack of sustained patriotic fervor and the merchants' greed blinding their judgment. But fundamentally, it is because many goods, even daily necessities, still do not have adequate replacements in our country. Even if there are, production is very low, and supply is insufficient. Coupled with the lack of organization in boycotting goods and the sabotage of unscrupulous merchants, the enemy goods are invisibly sold in the market again. Speaking of it, it is naturally a heartbreaking and tearful thing.</p>
<p>But here, I want to give a very simple example. Since the advent of domestic Wudi brand and other toothpowders, Japanese Diamond brand toothpowder has disappeared from our country. Doesn't this prove the rationality of the above? Therefore, I believe that passive resistance is temporary, ineffective, and incomplete. If we really want to resist thoroughly and forever, we must "strive for production." According to the text published on page 11 of this newspaper on October 19, the total amount of enemy goods imported in the year of the Republic of China in 1918 reached more than 340 million customs taels, of which cotton products accounted for the largest proportion.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth 106,486,000 Customs Taels 31.2%</p>
<p>Other cotton products 3,482,000 Customs Taels 1.6%</p>

<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>Year 22 of Guangxu (1896) (1) June 11th. Japan forced us to sign the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in accordance with the Treaty of Shimonoseki, totaling 29 articles. In addition to obtaining various economic benefits such as inland river navigation rights, Japan also obtained consular jurisdiction in China, undermining the independence of our country's legal rights. (2) Beijing Draft Treaty. The content concerns the Japanese concession issue.</p>
<p>Year 24 of Guangxu (1898) Sino-Japanese Beijing Treaty. Japan demanded that Fujian Province and its coastal areas be within Japan's sphere of influence and not be ceded to other countries.</p>
<p>Year 26 of Guangxu (1900) After the Boxer Rebellion broke out in our country, Japan was the first to send troops to Dagu and later joined the Allied Forces of various countries, capturing Tianjin and Beijing.</p>
<p>Year 27 of Guangxu (1901) The Boxer Protocol was established. Our country agreed to pay a compensation of 450 million taels of customs silver. Among them, Japan received 34,793,100 taels, and the embassy area was delineated, obtaining the right to station troops.</p>
<p>Year 28 of Guangxu (1903) Japan and Britain signed an alliance treaty to protect all interests of both countries in China.</p>
<p>Year 29 of Guangxu (1903) Sino-Japanese Additional Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Continued the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1896.</p>
<p>Year 30 of Guangxu (1904) Russo-Japanese War. They used our land as a battlefield. After Russia was defeated, the benefits Japan gained were transferred from our country. All vested rights of Russia in China were ceded to Japan.</p>
<p>Year 31 of Guangxu (1905) The Russo-Japanese War ended. Japan immediately forced our country to sign the Sino-Japanese Manchurian Agreement, forcing us to recognize all the rights Russia ceded to Japan in the Treaty of Portsmouth, and opened 17 ports as commercial ports in Fengtian Province: Fenghuangcheng, Liaoyang, Xinmintun, Tieling, Tongjiangzi, Famenku; Jilin Province: Changchun, Jilin, Harbin, Ningguta, Hunchun, Sanxing; Heilongjiang Province: Qiqihar, Hailar, Aihun, Manzhouli, etc. And delineating Japanese concessions in the commercial ports of Yingkou, Andong, and Fengtianfu, and other various interests.</p>
<p>Year 32 of Guangxu (1906) (1) In May, Japan established the South Manchurian Railway Company, and began to implement economic aggression in Manchuria. (2) In July, Japan established the Kwantung Governorate and the Kwantung Army Headquarters, establishing the foundation for political and military aggression. (3) Sino-Japanese Treaty for Supporting and Collecting Taxes in Yingkou.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn 5,843,000 Customs Taels 1.72%</p>
<p>Total 117,811,000 Customs Taels 34.62%</p>
<p>Therefore, the importance of cotton products can be imagined. We also compared the import reports of customs over the years. In recent years, the quantity of imported coarse count yarn and coarse cloth has gradually decreased significantly. This is because domestic coarse count yarn and coarse cloth have already had a considerable production quantity in recent years. Naturally, this is the crystallization of the hard work of the Chinese textile industry, worthy of our admiration. And I believe this is also the most glorious page in the history of Chinese industry.</p>
<p>Recently, a British newspaper published that cotton manufacturers in Lancashire have received many orders from China. This clearly proves that British goods are now replacing Japanese goods in China. Naturally, this is also a method of drinking poison to quench thirst and rejecting a wolf to welcome a tiger. But we can also see the urgent need for cotton products in our country.</p>
<p>Now there is very good news that can slightly comfort our patriotic people. The National Government has already reached an agreement to borrow money from England to purchase textile dyeing and finishing machinery. The purchased machinery will be handed over to manufacturers for self-management, and the loan will be repaid in installments. It is said that this is the result of the request of a magnate in the Chinese textile industry. I believe that although this move cannot completely collapse the Japanese textile industry, it will at least destroy a large part of its power. Therefore, I hope that those directly and indirectly involved will do their best to fulfill their responsibilities to support it, sponsor it, and guide it. Then, the problem of clothing, the first element of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood, will no longer need to rely on foreign countries. Humans can conquer nature. Let's all get up and work hard. (Transfer to Reimbursement and Disaster Relief)</p>
<p>Brief News: An Hating's starring role in "Orchid in the Empty Valley" has opened at the Nanjing People's Theater. The plot of the film is based on a popular novel, whose translation has spread all over the world, including in our country. It tells the sad history of a woman after marriage, suffering hardship and torture, tempted by the outside world and then expelled, enduring the pain of the world. Hating's performance, every move, is poignant and moving, enough to make people cry.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's Chronology of Japanese Aggression Against China and Various Massacres, the year of Guangxu 5 (1879) was a mistake; it should have been Guangxu 11th year (1885). Also, the "Di" character in "Di'erdao" is a mistake; it should be the character "Lu". We hereby make corrections.</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Chi looked intently and carefully. It was still the paradise of gentle breezes and bright sunshine, with no black wind blowing from beyond the sky. It was still the solid foundation of the Kaoshan Hall, with no signs of impending collapse. It was still the red-dressed, green-adorned singers and dancers, with no tears of jade or complaints of resentment. Pondering and pondering, thinking and thinking, the current happiness had not changed, so there was no need for him to call out for the abbot of the Wu'ai Hermitage. The moment this thought arose, it extinguished the exploratory electricity in the dark recesses of his brain, and he had already forgotten the Abbot of Wu'ai Hermitage somewhere beyond the clouds.</p>
<p>The dancers all came to inquire about the reason why he shouted "Wu'ai." Poor Tao Chi! How could he explain the reason, as his mind had once again darkened!</p>
<p>The dancers all danced together, also playing the music of Wu'ai:</p>
<p>What is Wu'ai? What is Wu'ai?</p>
<p>This place is great Wu'ai!</p>
<p>No past, no future, only the present;</p>
<p>This place is great Wu'ai!</p>
<p>Unknowingly, Tao Chi also followed their melody and rhythm, responding to this song of Wu'ai:</p>
<p>What is Wu'ai? What is Wu'ai?</p>
<p>There is great Wu'ai here!</p>
<p>Forgetting the past, throwing away the future, loving the present;</p>
<p>There is great Wu'ai here!</p>
<p>Tao Chi was infatuated with the present, truly "forgetting his homeland for pleasure" here! He firmly believed that this current Tao honey date could not be finished chewing even in ten thousand years. Who would have thought that a formless and silent blow would strike Tao Chi, making everything go black before his eyes? After a moment, he was able to open his eyes, as if awakening from a dream, still sitting in this revolving chair. The abbot in front of him, holding a wooden pestle for striking bells, had not yet put it down, only smiling coldly at him. And there was a faint lingering pain on his forehead. When he reached out to touch it, there was a lump the size of a chestnut, most likely a gift from the abbot's pestle! Alas! Where had the endless honey date gone? It had been replaced by a stubborn, irremovable bruise.</p>

<p>People are Confused, the Market is Confusing. Last week, the price of gold fluctuated greatly. The raging waves were unstoppable. There were fluctuations of more than ten taels per day. At the beginning of the week, it was quite sluggish, and finally fell to 685 taels. Soon after, it turned from weak to strong, and on Thursday, it even reached a high point of 722 taels. Afterwards, it tended to decline, but the chaos was unsettled, hovering around 700 taels. People were very confused. News at home and abroad varied. However, the League of Nations still found it difficult to resolve the issue of violent Japan and showed no signs of progress. The silver market rose and fell from time to time, and the situation was inconsistent. To sum up, British silver fell while American silver rose. The exchange rates of British and American currencies in Shanghai went from loose to tight, and the listed prices shrank by two levels. Chinese merchants had different opinions, but now they are all shorting. Occasionally, there are hedging transactions. As for the price of gold, there were a total of thirty-seven taels difference in these six days, and in the end, it still rose by twelve taels and eight qian. However, the long and short sides checked and balanced each other, so the rise and fall were unpredictable and there were many twists and turns. Moreover, the situation changed from time to time, and people were panicked. However, although the spot inventory was exhausted, the extremely tight silver supply reduced the ability to accept orders. Yesterday (the 25th), the large silver dollar slightly recovered by 125, and today's gold market still has a chance to change. The general situation of the week is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The overall rise was twelve taels and eight qian from Monday (October 19).</p>
<p>The large silver dollar continued to rise by 1875. The price of silver only increased by 125 shillings, and the listed price did not change. The US dollar was added by 125 due to exchange arbitrage, while the domestic market seemed loose. The industry's positions varied. The gold market opened and increased by one tael to 693.5 taels. The Middle East and Indian buyers were satisfied, and the market seemed good. The next price was 98 taels. Later, it was heard that a lot of cash was flowing out of the United States, fearing that the gold market would be affected and especially preventing the ban on exports. Therefore, people were frustrated and dropped to 93 taels. The noon closing was 95 taels and 7 qian. In the afternoon, it was 96 taels. After the opening, a storm suddenly arose. Various unfavorable news for the gold market came one after another, saying that the United States was going to have another silver conference, the domestic cabinet was in turmoil, and it was rumored that HSBC would not list Japanese gold, etc. The market price plummeted and finally settled at 85 taels. The closing price returned to 88 taels and 3 qian, which was 4 taels and 2 qian lower than the previous weekend. It had fallen for three consecutive days, a total of thirteen taels and four qian. From morning to night, there was a fluctuation of thirteen taels. On Tuesday, the large silver dollar rose another 0.0625, the price of silver rose by 25, and the shilling remained the same. The US dollar was listed at 25. The domestic market suddenly turned excellent. Industry's position settled down tirelessly. The initial opening of the gold price rose by 3 taels and 2 qian to 91.5 taels, which was actually due to the United States selling silver. It then slightly retreated by 2 taels to 89.5 taels. Later, there were more buyers, and it gradually rose to 95 taels and 5 qian. It was also heard that Canada banned gold exports, and no outflow was allowed except for passports issued by the government. Therefore, there were more sellers in the market, and it dropped to 90 taels. The noon closing was 92 taels and 8 qian. In the afternoon, it was 94 taels and 5 qian. Later, it was suddenly heard that Japan was withdrawing its troops, the atmosphere suddenly improved, and it suddenly rushed out of 700 taels, soaring by more than ten taels, reaching 708 taels. Large households chased after it, and the closing was 07 taels and 7 qian, which was a rebound of 19 taels and 4 qian compared to the previous day, a reversal of the three consecutive days of decline. The front and rear markets had a total fluctuation of 18.5 taels, which was the opposite of the previous day. On Wednesday, the large silver dollar fell back by half a penny, the US silver fell by only 25, and the shilling also decreased by one and a half grades. The internal market followed suit, and Chinese and Jewish merchants were all diligent in their positions. However, the initial opening of the gold price went down by 1 tael and 7 qian to 706 taels, which was actually due to the slight reduction in the price of silver. Afterwards, the fluctuations were quite large, with ups and downs of several taels at every turn. The short covering was especially strong at noon, reaching 15 taels and 2 qian, and at the closing, it was 14 taels and 8 qian. In the afternoon, it reached 16 taels and a half, and then 13 taels and 8 qian. Later, the Indian exchange rate reported small, and it was heard that the United Kingdom was maintaining the gold standard. Then the big players advanced, reaching 18 taels and 8 qian, and at the closing, it was 18 taels and 4 qian, an increase of 10 taels and 7 qian. There was a fluctuation of 13 taels and 8 qian that day. In general, the short side was eager to cover, and the exchange code was also small. On Thursday, the British and American silver markets both shrank by 25. HSBC's listed price was changed three times, a total of two grades. The internal market also improved. The gold price fell by 9 taels and 4 qian at the opening, totaling 709 taels, which was actually due to the British people advocating the use of silver in the newspapers, and there was no optimism about the League of Nations' attitude towards Japan. People's hearts should tend to be weak. The next price was 05 taels and 7 qian. Then, with the big players chasing in, and with the shilling shrinking, it soared by 10 taels at noon to 16 taels. At the closing, it was 13 taels and 2 qian. In the afternoon, it was 12 taels and 2 qian to 12 taels. Later, due to the continued shrinkage of various exchange rates, the Cantonese merchants scrambled to buy and suddenly broke through 720 taels, totaling 21 taels. Then, Zhifeng Yong and others sold, and the closing was 16 taels and 1 qian, which was a slight recovery of 2 taels and 3 qian compared to the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 16 taels and 3 qian throughout the day. The next day, the large silver dollar shrank by 0.1875, the price of silver shrank by 25, and the British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. The internal market tended to be firm, and the gold market opened slightly lower by 2 taels and 6 qian to 13 taels and 5 qian. The situation was chaotic. The next price was 15 taels and 5 qian. Afterwards, the trend became more and more downward. At noon, it was only 04 taels and 5 qian, which was actually due to the urgent silver supply, the fear of no receiving of spot goods, and the strong sellers. In the afternoon, the exchange market was particularly weak, plummeting by seven or eight taels and breaking through 700 taels, totaling 97 taels and a half. Then it was increased to 703 taels, which was chased in by speculators. However, the closing price still returned to 699 taels and a half, continuing to drop by 16 taels and 6 qian. In the end, there was a fluctuation of 18 taels. On Saturday, the large silver dollar rose by 0.0625, the price rose by half a cent, and the shilling increased by one and a half cents. However, the internal market shrank first, sincerely revealing a tendency to secretly improve. The gold market opened and increased by 1 tael and a half to 701 taels, because of the private telegram for an increase. The next price was from 02 taels and a half to 699 taels and a half, then Hengxing came to sell. Because of the strong buying, it went out to 700 taels again, but there were ambushes, so the buying and selling were inconsistent. At noon, it reached 06 taels. The internal market exchange market improved. At the closing, it was 05 taels and 3 qian, which was an increase of 5 taels and 8 qian compared to the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 8 taels and 5 qian in half a day, and people's hearts were very good. Now, the high and low prices of the British and American markets, the exchange rates, and the gold price are described separately below.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, so the silver supply situation remained tight. The silver discount rate in the morning and afternoon markets was still 5 qian. The foreign interest rate market price had returned to its original state, with the morning market at 7 qian, 2 fen, 7 li and a half, and the afternoon market at 7 qian, 2 fen, 7 li and 2 hao and a half. As a result, the price was about 1 li lower than the afternoon market price of the previous day. Transactions were made. The morning market exchanged 300,000 yuan in drafts, and the afternoon market exchanged 500,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan. There were no transactions in banknotes in both markets.

<h3 id="e180">Securities Market Last Week, Bond Market Initially Fell Sharply <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Weekend rebound, market sentiment stabilized</p>
<p>Still down about two or three yuan from the previous week</p>
<p>Market conditions slightly better, forward trading more active</p>
<p>During the past week (from October 19 to 24), the bond market conditions of the local securities exchange, except for 96, were almost all open. However, although there were many types of trading open every day, the transactions were rare. The total turnover was 85,500 yuan. Except for 16,000 yuan for demobilization and 12,000 yuan for troop reduction, the others were less than 10,000 yuan. The forward market was generally better, with buying and selling becoming more active. Since the exchange exempted the seller (November period) from margin for arbitrage trading, arbitrage trading was very active, and forward trading became active. Except for the two types of 96 and the entire 6, the others were all open. It was no longer like the previous week, when only the October period was available. In the first half of the week, the daily turnover was 9 million yuan. The afternoon turnover was about 14 million yuan, with a total turnover of 71.22 million yuan, which was more than 26.9 million yuan more than the previous week. The unified tax and salt tax were more. The unified tax was 13 million yuan in the October period and 3.42 million yuan in the November period. The salt tax was 7.52 million yuan in the October period and 2.28 million yuan in the November period. The 20 customs also doubled compared to the previous period, with 10.075 million yuan in the October period and 3.18 million yuan in the November period. The 20 cigarette tax was 6.255 million yuan in the October period and 1.725 million yuan in the November period. The 19 customs was 4.535 million yuan in the October period and 1.055 million yuan in the November period. The 19 charity was 4.045 million yuan in the October period and 1.445 million yuan in the November period. The troop reduction was 3.84 million yuan in the October period and 1.355 million yuan in the November period. The demobilization totaled 4.405 million yuan. The others were calm, such as 1.165 million yuan in customs duties, 900,500 yuan in 96 public bonds, and 910,500 yuan in the entire 6 percent. In terms of the price changes, in the first half of the week, the diplomatic situation was chaotic, the League of Nations' attitude towards Japan was strong, and military actions were still being taken in the Northeast. Although the situation was缓和, there was no hope for peace in the short term, and the meetings rarely yielded results.猶宰 Yuefang's representative arrived in Shanghai, and domestic peace and unification were very impressive. Therefore, the market stabilized slightly. Although large households were still waiting, the daily prices still had considerable ups and downs. The supply and demand situation was more peaceful, and the bond prices also changed unpredictably, with daily涨 and跌. There was no consistent trend. During the week, the environmental situation deteriorated again. Japan rejected the withdrawal of troops on many occasions, and people's hearts turned pessimistic again. In addition, the recent financial situation felt particularly tight. The market's demand for cash was very tight, and the interest rate soared, which was unprecedented in recent times. Moreover, the delivery period for this month's forward bonds was approaching, and the old bulls had few options other than receiving goods. The sellers rarely covered, and investors were extremely cautious. The market showed a trend of being squeezed by multiple parties. The near-term prices were much lower than the forward prices. Because the market prices of various bonds fell sharply, there was a temporary feeling of unease. However, on the weekend, the market suddenly had special changes. The situation in China was very good. For the sake of its own maintenance, the League of Nations had to urgently plan a solution. The resolution to withdraw troops within three weeks, limited to the day, had been passed despite Japan's opposition. Although there were many difficulties ahead, it was indeed satisfactory to get this. Therefore, the market sentiment improved, and the buying interest was lively. The prices of each day rebounded significantly. The market stabilized slightly for a while. As a result, the October period of each bond future fell by three or four yuan compared to the previous week. Only the demobilization customs duty was established. November had mixed涨 and跌, but the跌 was also slight. The spot price also generally fell back. The spot price of 19 charity was about 20 yuan lower than two months ago. The statistics of the high, low,涨 and跌 of each bond price in the past week are listed in the following table. (Unit: yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e181">Yarn and Cotton Last Week's Sluggish Yarn Market <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Pessimistic National Affairs...Extremely Tight Finances</p>
<p>Sales are Increasingly Quiet...Consistent Decline</p>
<p>The yarn market in the past week has had a shaky and unstable appearance. Firstly, national affairs are in turmoil and unstable, and finances are extremely tight with silver discounts rising daily. Secondly, due to the silver supply this month, recipients are particularly lacking, and actual sales are increasingly quiet. Each group has no excitement, and the situation is getting weaker. Near-month prices are easing, and the decline in far-month prices is even more severe. Each month has broken the 60 tael mark. Fortunately, the market has a thin base of goods, and each factory has no intention of selling off. Although there is an extremely bad environment, it can still be supported for a while. Moreover, the anti-Japanese movement is fierce, the number of shipments is reduced, and the supply of local yarn is insufficient for demand. The future will also be a small extreme decline. Each group's purchase of spot transactions is very stagnant. The price of marked yarn for the near month is down 2.3 taels compared to the previous week, and the far month is down 1.2 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Last Week's Marked Cotton Rose with US Cotton <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market in the past week has been gradually rising. Because of the firm trend of US cotton and good transactions of Far Eastern cotton textiles, the situation is very stable, which has led to a帶 in people's hearts. At the same time, the exchange rate has also stabilized, so the buyer's minds are quiet. And a part of them think that foreign cotton may be temporarily stable, and they have greatly offset their short positions, so the surface is tight and the market trend is gradually increasing. And there are many mentalities that must look at four taels. However, spot cotton transactions are still light, and each factory has no large appetite. Because the amount of Indian and American cotton bags purchased before is very large, and the price is high, there is no urgent need to purchase for the time being, so the rise is still flat. However, Chinese cotton is higher than foreign cotton, so the rise is slightly suppressed. However, the current bullish attitude is abnormal, and the view and pull are particularly strong. However, the world's cotton production is still in surplus. What the future will be is still based on US cotton. In the middle of this week, each factory has bought a lot of foreign cotton again. The price of marked cotton for each month has risen by one tael and one or two qian compared to the previous week.</p>

<p>Southern Hedging...Bullish Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially weak due to Southern hedging, then firm due to inter-dealer buying, and finally soft again due to bullish settlement. Futures fell by two to seven pounds, and spot fell by five pounds. British cotton futures rose by nine points, and spot rose by eleven points. Egyptian cotton spot was unchanged. Indian cotton merchants sold slightly, and the market was firm and stable. Ping Guoer rose by 2.25 rupees, Aomu La rose by 2.75 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 3.5 rupees.

<p>Yesterday, the Nantou gangs arrived with the second and third shipments. The market sales were in a slump. Changxi's new japonica rice and the plummeting trend intensified. The opening price was reduced by two jiao. Kiln-grown red and white rice was sold as soon as it arrived. There were no涨 or跌 in the market. Qingjiao Xijin and Baige arrived one after another, and the appetite from all sides was sluggish. The price followed the general trend and went downstream. The old and broken were selling briskly. Transactions were slightly better, but the market was also tired by one jiao. The foreign Dujian and Bianyin Yuan had no honor or disgrace. The Hekai cargo was 1,600 to 1,700 dan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Xinzhagang shipments were slightly arrived. The market of new and old Beijaponica rice stepped lower. The second-rate goods were about three jiao short. The market situation had a sign of松 again. The kiln-grown had a temporary boom, arriving to sell in a sluggish state, and the price was reduced by nearly a jiao. The transaction of the foreign Tip was increasingly rare, and the river accumulation turned abundant. The buying interest was quiet. Not many Dujian shipments arrived, and there were few zero splits. The production area continued to report softening, and the price was slightly lower by one jiao.</p>

<p>British and French Silk Telegrams Did Not Improve...Sales Became Increasingly Weary and Stagnant</p>
<p>Silk Factories Unable to Support...Increasing Number of滅T Closures and Shutdowns</p>
<p>During the past week, the silk market of the local foreign firms still had no turning point. Due to the sluggish sales of silk fabrics in London and Lyon, Japan's silk was flooded, and Chinese silk had no appetite. The white factory business still had a market with no sales. Although New York had a telegram, the selection of goods was very meticulous. Irvines (i.e., uniformity) had to be above 83 points, and the recognition disk was increasingly harsh. The incoming price was surprisingly small. The A-body B-grade price was almost comparable to the B-grade middle-body. The factory had to lose 100 to 200 taels. The loss was too great and difficult to sell off. The European sales of Sichuan Qian 2 were also clear. Therefore, last week, white factory products only had supplementary transactions, with a total turnover of more than 200 packages. The output of current silk was less than 500 packages. The depression of the Chinese and foreign silk markets was increasing day by day. The silk stock of silk factories was increasing day by day. The turnover was無資. The silver supply was extremely tight and unable to support. The number of companies closing down and reducing their workers was increasing day by day. There were 106 silk factories in the entire Shanghai, and 48 silk factories in Wuxi. Currently, there are only about 60 factories working normally in Shanghai and Wuxi. There are less than 10 factories in Zhejiang's Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou and Jiaxing. During the week, the overseas Chinese silk price still tended to be flat and tired.</p>

<p>— A Female Student of Wanxi Futang</p>
<p>Since the East Province Incident, our school has been filled with an atmosphere of pain and anger. We wished we could immediately expel those violent and unreasonable "dwarf slaves" from the country. Whether in class or during breaks, no one could forget this national humiliation. Universities have all suspended classes, and their students are going out to promote, lecture, and petition, truly busy to the point of forgetting food and sleep. Although we have not suspended classes, we also have to do some work. Therefore, the third-year senior high school students of our school initiated a gathering of all students, asking them to write slogans, draw cartoons, and publicize the facts to male and female school employees in their spare time. However, in our work, we have adhered to two principles: "Saving the country without forgetting to study, studying without forgetting to save the country."</p>
<p>Since the slogans and cartoons were posted, some foreign teachers seemed to disapprove of this action. They sometimes said to each other that they were afraid it would become a successful mob. But our studies have never been neglected, so they had no choice but to accept it. Our school is a member of the International Student League, which holds regular meetings once a month. When the meeting day arrived, we naturally received a letter notifying us. But in this time of national crisis, who would still be in the mood for entertainment? So, the president went to tell the advisor.</p>
<p>"Mr. Ke, we are not going to the International Student League meeting today because there are other things to do at school," the president said to a foreign teacher.</p>
<p>"What, you are not going to the meeting? The spirit of the Chinese is too lacking! That's why your country has come to this state!" Mr. Ke said to her with a hint of anger and sarcasm.</p>
<p>Her face flushed red, and tears were almost about to fall, but she tried her best to calm down. Her gaze shot straight at the face of her so-called enemy, and she replied fiercely,</p>
<p>"May I ask, Mr. Ke, if your country were also in distress, would you still be in the mood to enjoy yourself?"</p>
<p>Mr. Ke became angry out of shame, and she said loudly, "No matter what, at least ten people must go!"</p>
<p>Tears streamed down from the president's eyes, and she was at a loss for what to do. So, she called an emergency meeting.</p>
<p>"Everyone, I never thought that our country has not yet perished, but foreigners are already treating us like slaves of a conquered nation! Today, Mr. Ke's order requires ten people to go to the meeting."</p>
<p>"We definitely won't go! Let's see what she can do! At worst, we'll argue it out with the principal, but we have a strong case. Who's afraid of her? Does the principal not distinguish between right and wrong?" Ping stood up and said angrily.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have the same idea as Ping," Zhao echoed Ping's words.</p>
<p>"Everyone, please listen to me. Yesterday, my older sister came to school to see me. She also mentioned the matter of attending the meeting today. I told her that we would definitely not go. She told me that the other students in our school were also not going, but the International Student League called and said that a foreigner who had just returned to Shanghai from an investigation in the East Province was going to speak today, and they hoped that all the Chinese would attend. So, they also joined. Since Mr. Ke insists that we go, and since today is not a social gathering, why not just send a few people? On the one hand, we can publicize our views to the people of other countries when we go, and on the other hand, we can settle this matter. Wouldn't that be a win-win situation?" Fen, who has always been afraid of causing trouble, offered this idea.</p>
<p>In the end, they all adopted Fen's method. However, those who went to the meeting all wore black clothes and were not allowed to wear makeup or lipstick. When Mr. Ke saw this attire, although she was unhappy, she only dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out.</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, we are already unable to tolerate being slightly despised by foreigners in our school. Alas, please think about the compatriots in the East Province. How are they being treated since the Japanese occupied them? Do they willingly accept it? If we want to wash away this shame, we must all unite and swear to resist foreign aggression. Compatriots, let's rise up! Strive, strive!</p>

<p>By Cao Baichuan</p>
<p>Since the literary revolution, the Chinese literary scene seems to have been advancing at a rapid pace. In terms of creation, whether it is poetry, novels, or dramas, we cannot deny that there has been considerable achievement. Especially in novels, we can truly produce some excellent works. This is something that everyone cannot deny. However, books on literary theory are quite disappointing. Is it that everyone feels that literary theory is unnecessary, or do they feel that this work is difficult? Naturally, literary theory is an extremely necessary thing. This is something that those who study literature today are gradually realizing. But why are so few people doing this work? Naturally, everyone feels that this work is difficult to handle. Because to do this kind of work, if you don't have considerable research, you simply can't start. It's not like creation, where you can pick up a pen and write something, good or bad. So there are very few works on this subject. Even if there are any, they are just copying and piecing together bits and pieces without any system, just a mess of random compilation. How can they have any research and insights? How can they be called works?</p>
<p>Now, let's just talk about a book like "An Introduction to Literature." It is really impossible to find a perfect "Introduction to Literature" in China. I have personally read only four books. One is Ma Zonghuo's "An Introduction to Literature." Because the author of this book does not have a good understanding of the subject of "Introduction to Literature," the content inevitably has some inexplicable points. The second is Jiang Liangfu's "Lectures on Literature." Although this book has its strengths, the content is not pure enough. Finally, we must mention Homma Hisao's "An Introduction to Literature." There are two translations of this book in our country, one translated by Zhang Xichen and the other translated by Wang Fuquan. The content is still systematic, but it lacks insight. For example, when talking about the definition of literature, he makes a detailed copy of the doctrines of many people, but he himself does not come up with a clear definition of literature. So many people say that he is "copying and pasting," which is very accurate.</p>
<p>Now I want to introduce here a book on literary introduction that is very suitable for ordinary people to read. This is Cao Baichuan's "An Introduction to Literature," which was recently published.</p>
<p>This book is divided into the following ten chapters:</p>
<p>(1) Definition of Literature</p>
<p>(2) Characteristics of Literature</p>
<p>(3) Origin of Literature</p>
<p>(4) Elements of Literature</p>
<p>(5) Form of Literature</p>
<p>(6) Literature and Life</p>
<p>(7) Literature and the Times</p>
<p>(8) Literature and National Character</p>
<p>(9) Literature and Morality</p>
<p>(10) Literary Criticism</p>
<p>Looking at the above chapters, we can imagine the content of this book. Moreover, he also adopts Homma Hisao's chapter division method, marking many small subheadings under each chapter, making it easy to understand at a glance. Now I will briefly introduce the content of each chapter.</p>
<p>Chapter 1, Definition of Literature. He first talks about the literary concepts of scholars in China throughout the ages, and then talks about the reasons for Westerners' definition of literature and the reasons for the complexity of the definition of literature. Then, he talks about exploring the definition of literature from the elements and purposes of literature, and the various theories of dividing literature into two categories based on the two elements of thought and emotion. This chapter introduces the views of Chinese and foreign celebrities such as Pancost, Posnett, Hunt, Sainte-Beuve, De Quincey, and Zeng Guofan. Chapter 2, Characteristics of Literature. He explains the five characteristics of literature—truthfulness, infectiousness, beauty, permanence, and universality—very clearly, and also cites the views of famous people from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, Origin of Literature. This chapter first talks about the theories of the origin of art of the idealist school and the materialist school. Then, it introduces the theories of Shirakawa Hakuson, Mackenzie, and Morton. Then, it discusses the reason for the rhyme in primitive literature. Finally, it talks about the characteristics of primitive literature.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Elements of Literature. This chapter discusses the essentials of the three elements of thought, emotion, and imagination in a very simple and clear way, such as the types of thought, emotion, and imagination, as well as their expression methods, etc. As for the "form" item, which is also one of the elements of literature, it is described in another chapter, namely Chapter 5.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Form of Literature. This chapter first talks about the importance of form, and then discusses the key points of form. Whether it belongs to style or rhetoric, it is clearly discussed. Finally, it talks about the adaptation of form.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Literature and Life. This chapter first talks about the relationship between literature and life, and then discusses the two methods of expressing life: realism and idealism.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, Literature and the Times. This chapter first discusses the close relationship between literature and the times, then talks about the new literature and art of the twentieth century, and then talks about the historical facts related to literature and the times, and the trends of literature and art. From classicism, romanticism, naturalism, to neo-romanticism, they are all explained very simply and clearly.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Literature and National Character. The main points discussed in this chapter are as follows: the relationship between literature and national character 丨丨 the necessity of understanding national character in studying or appreciating literature 丨丨 the influence of race, which is the foundation of national character, on literature 丨丨 the preservation of national spirit by literature 丨丨 historical facts related to literature and national character, the differences in literature between Southern Europe and Northern Europe, the differences in literature between England, France, and Russia, the differences in literature between Southern China and Northern China, the differences between the literatures of fifteen countries 丨丨 the fusion of national character and its influence on the historical facts of literature, the literature of England and Tang Dynasty, etc.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, Literature and Morality. The main points discussed in this chapter are: important issues in literature and art, whether artistic or related to life 丨丨 the nature and relationship between art and morality 丨丨 the objectivity of art, the morality of artists 丨丨 the material of literature and art and the attitude of writers 丨丨 literature and art and propaganda, etc.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 is Literary Criticism. This chapter discusses the meaning of literary criticism, the difference between literary criticism and literature, the duties of literary critics, and the classification of literary criticism. Finally, it talks about six important modern criticisms: scientific criticism, ethical criticism, appreciation criticism, impression criticism, expression criticism, and social criticism.</p>
<p>The content of this introduction to literature has been briefly introduced. As for the detailed content of this book, please readers find a copy to read. I am responsible for introducing it here.</p>
