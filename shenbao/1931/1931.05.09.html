<h3>期麥市虛軟不振</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面上下午開盤後各月份市面大致見平軟之態以洋麥報價旣小六七角天時旣轉熱又有暢晴之象故買氣已虛大致趨觀望之態惟以賣方不湧市面尙能擯住耳觀察後步如果氣候順逐洋麥又未活動恐難續擯也結果本月份較前日小一分六月份小二分七月份小一分八月份小二分九月份小一分十月份小二分云</p>

<h3>今日的女探險家</h3>
<p>— 富蘭</p>
<p>婦女們到了今日她們的地位處處要與男子們並駕齊驅了但也有人說婦女不配做探險家只是自從英國的皇家輿地協會核准耐思夫人Mrs　Ness加入該會爲第一個的女會員以後於是婦女們一般地堪作有價值的探險家不再成爲問題了這一件的核准說來話長而且富有興味原來歐洲女子們在常人不大知道的地面上探險由來已久但大部分每爲了種種的障碍尤其是男子的反對致令她們的本能没有表白的機會</p>
<p>大約在五十年以前當時英國的皇家輿地協會會長曾建議一位女子入會但是這個主張這般的震動會友們的心坎所以時作時輟地討論了八個月終於打銷了事這等情形本來到今日還依然存在但自從大無畏的非洲探險家褒德女士（ＭissBird）毅然拒絕該會的邀請叙述她的經歷除非允許她加入爲女會友的第一人於是那般鬚眉男子也不覺爲之氣阻了</p>
<p>探險的女子們有了豐富的收穫但是依然被人懷疑而一般男會友間的反對又這般强烈他們曾訂有規約不許女會友的實現自然不容有女新會友加入最後經寇仲貴族（Lord　Curzon）提議照常例允許女子入會而在事實上蘇格蘭輿地協會業經承認了女探險家這一來纔把一切反對的聲勢壓住到了今日千百位的女子都可以要求這個入會的權利和專利以視她們早日跋涉萬里的先驅者要求這類權利和專利而終不可得也大可以自慰了</p>
<p>雖則今日之下有些人依然不相信探險和牠所附屬的一切事情可以配女子們去幹但是單只福倍斯夫人（Mrs.　R.　Forbes）一人的工作已足證明現代的女在地理學世界上儘有了她一己的位置憑了她的能力智慧收集下許多極有價值的資料她把所見的一切確當地叙述出來眞大有助於科學家的研究正不單只用她和悅的態度拿來告訴一般俗人已也</p>
<p>宓爾斯夫人（Lady　DorothyMills）先後在西印度的海悌島（）非洲的尼羅河流域以及法屬西非洲的聽勃克吐（Timbucto）等處地方非常活動創造了許多有價值的記錄還有史密斯女士她的探險心上從不滿足除非探險到離開文明很遠很遠的所在有要多她的旅程帶她進一般主人的裏面習練（吹管）和（毒梭）的使用引起她的特别愉快她已經環繞地球幾次凡她足跡所經之處多爲女子們從來不曾到過的</p>
<p>好敦勞格司女士（Hanghton　Rogers）業經在南美洲腹部探險過三萬哩的地方還有巴蘭德女士（Ada　Boyland）經歷過波斯六千哩土地住在一般士人的幕帳裏好使她的調查格外來得可靠眞給我們增加了不少關於東方地理的智識</p>
<p>許多的女子並不是單獨去探險却和她們的丈夫合作幹出非常有價值的工作原來脫夫人（Ｍrs　Court　Mreatt）就用這個方法去探險非洲一途一路的考察調查她們除了實際的牛車旅行和隨地發現外有許多地方都借重照相鏡來工作因爲牠往往能於探險過去之後留下無可形容的價值任何一位女探險家如果你問她還是把照相鏡棄下呢還是把防身手鎗棄下她一定寧願放棄後面的一種</p>
<p>漫游是許多女子着手探險的第一步她們對於新事物原富具天生的好奇心立刻會激起她們的興趣在極短的時間中她們能尋出她們所能的一切於是去記錄她們的印象</p>
<p>不安疲勞和危險常常包裹在這樁工作之中但是一般大無畏的女子們對於她們一己的安寧早被好勝心所克服對此極少注意這是多麽可驚可敬啊凡是一位女子一旦做了探險家她早把這種貪生怕死喜逸惡勞的脾氣丢的乾凈除非環境强迫着她</p>
<p>女子們的喜歡探險也從不爲年齡所限廷罕女士（Doris　Dinham）只有廿二歲的年紀已經同了非洲土著的嚮導遍歷該洲大野二千哩從她的經歷裏可以聚集許多的資料她曾經過人吃人的材落她曾在森林中迷路她曾在一株樹旁過夜她曾給兇惡的土人追趕此外她還在四無人烟的大森林中漫游十四天</p>
<p>雖則女子們普通不被視爲製地圖的良手但是許多女探險家立刻獲到一種製圖的技能這有不少有價值的例子可以證明的關於此點有一樁可注意的回溯就見當歐洲大戰之時西歐前線需要各地地圖英國皇家輿地協會奉命製造當時就有許多的女子中選擔任像那位雷諾持夫人（Ｍrs　Reynolds）更要推此中妙手若干俄羅斯的百萬分之一的地圖就直接從她的手内傳印至今還有存留在世</p>
<p>女子工作的價值縱使她的探險已成過去也没有停止的時候她所聚集攏來的每段報告都於科學界有相當的貢獻而爲人們好生保存的總之女性對於今後地理學上的功績必一天大似一天</p>

<h3>Unequal Treaties</h3>
<p>Looking at the global situation, if we want permanent world peace, it is impossible without liberating oppressed nations and placing them on an equal footing. Speaking from the perspective of our own nation, if we want national peace, unification, and the completion of the revolution, it is impossible without breaking the aggressive policies of various nations and abolishing unequal treaties. Therefore, the abolition of unequal treaties is a significant mission entrusted to the National Assembly and is also a goal for which our people have long strived and will not stop until it is achieved. Among these unequal treaties, two matters are especially deeply regretted by our people. One is the issue of recovering consular jurisdiction. The people of our nation all consider this issue to be the most urgent task in abolishing unequal treaties. However, after negotiations to this day, a majority of nations have yet to resolutely acknowledge this, which is something our people should strive for first. The other is the Twenty-One Demands that Japan forced upon us during the era of the Beijing government. These demands are undoubtedly considered a great humiliation and disgrace by our people, who have vowed never to acknowledge them. Today, as we commemorate this humiliation and reflect on the reasons for its occurrence, we should strive to strengthen ourselves and, in particular, strive to expedite the abolition of unequal treaties. For as long as these unequal treaties exist, our nation's international standing cannot be elevated, and the humiliation of our people cannot be erased. Furthermore, I would argue that the world's powerful nations are now promoting international equality and assisting weaker nations in their pursuit of world peace. If they are still reluctant to relinquish these unequal treaties with us, how can they be trusted by the world?</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Received</p>
<p>The following has been received: (1) There should be regulations regarding the terms of office for National Assembly members and the Chairman, either limited to the six years of the period of political tutelage or until the expiration of the term from the date of the promulgation of the constitution. (2) The number of National Assembly members need not be excessive, but the selection of personnel must be meticulous. (3) The 21 articles of the Outline of National Reconstruction stipulate that, before the promulgation of the constitution, the appointment and removal of the heads of the five Yuan all fall under the jurisdiction of the President. Now, Articles 6 and 7 of the Provisional Constitution state that National Assembly members are selected by the Central Committee. In reality, many of the heads of the Yuan are concurrently National Assembly members. Therefore, the heads of the five Yuan should also be nominated by the Central Committee and appointed by the National Government, which is more in line with the facts. Of the above three items, the first and second items will be submitted to the second reading session, except for the third item, which was formally discussed in today's assembly. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The discussion of the draft Provisional Constitution in Nanjing lasted a total of four hours and forty-three minutes in the morning and afternoon. However, there are still more than ten people who have submitted speaking slips but have not yet taken the stage, which shows the importance that each representative attaches to this matter. Even the important figures of the Central Committee listened attentively when the representatives expressed their opinions. When the speaker read the draft and turned the page, the sound of paper rustling filled the entire venue, breaking the silence of the meeting place. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hu Jianzhong, a representative from Zhejiang in Nanjing and the editor-in-chief of the Hangzhou Republican Daily News, plans to amend Article 15 of the draft Provisional Constitution to read: "The people shall have the freedom to express opinions and publish works, without being subject to any special laws or the inspection of inspection agencies," and will submit it in writing during the second reading session. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The educational circles in Nanjing are advocating for the amendment of the draft law. Shao Shuangqiu has drafted a statement of opinion regarding the chapter on education and has printed and distributed pamphlets to solicit the consent of the educational circles in Beijing. More than 2,800 people have signed their names to join, and the signed statements of opinion have been compiled into a thick volume and sent to the General Secretariat of the National Assembly for reference by the Assembly. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Due to Wu Jingheng's absence from Nanjing, Cai Yuanpei will convene the Provisional Constitution Review Committee. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>During the discussion of the Provisional Constitution at the Nanjing Assembly on the afternoon of the eighth, a certain representative who took the stage to speak had an undignified attitude and his language was also somewhat incoherent. After Chairman Yu Youren stopped him and he stepped down from the stage, the audience applauded thunderously, as if to show their displeasure. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>List of Members of Each Review Committee</p>
<p>The Presidium in Nanjing reported the list of members of each review committee at the first meeting as follows:</p>

<p>Representatives from various provinces and cities in Nanjing who have common interests and relationships within each other's regions, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou, and the Northeast and Northwest, have all established close ties, either by running around to make contact or by exchanging ideas through banquets and tea parties, which is very busy. Many use inductive methods for proposals to seek brevity, co-sign each other to avoid complexity and dispersion, and also make many appointments to broaden their horizons when discussing important bills and not to be petty about narrow and local issues.

<p>Talks in the Visitors' Gallery</p>
<p>Three Japanese People Describe Their Impressions</p>
<p>Only Ms. Miyazaki Byakuren, dressed in a black silk Chinese outfit and wearing gold-rimmed glasses, was an observer from Japan at today's formal meeting for Japanese women. She sat shoulder-to-shoulder with Ms. Soong Mei-ling and Ms. Soong Ai-ling in the visitor's gallery at the front of the venue. Miyazaki Ryusuke, Dr. Soejima, and others sat next to her. Ms. Byakuren told the Dentsu reporter her impressions: "I am very fortunate to be able to visit the first parliament of the Republic of China thanks to the kindness of President Dai. Although I do not understand the language and the contents of the proceedings, I regret this somewhat. However, the fact that important figures such as Jiang and Dai and ordinary representatives are deliberating together without distinction between high and low is very egalitarian and I have a very good impression of it. The order in the meeting place is orderly, unlike the shouting and abuse of the Japanese parliament, which seems to lack dominance. However, it is very gratifying for women to be elected to the Presidium of the first parliament, and I am keenly aware that this atmosphere of freedom is different from Japan. Dr. Soejima said, "The implementation of the Presidium is a unique and interesting system, and it is unexpected that the first parliament is able to maintain order and be orderly. Three minutes of silence is very good for cultivating Qi, and although I was an observer, I also joined in the silent prayer and had a very good experience. If the Japanese parliament were to order silent prayer, it might be able to improve it somewhat. Government officials are listed in the general seats, which is very popular and they do not call the names of the parliamentarians but the numbers of the seats. This system is also very interesting." Miyazaki Ryusuke said, "This is my first time seeing the Chinese Parliament. Although I feel that there is a lack of dominance, the overall atmosphere is very popular and there is no bureaucratic stink like in Japan. This has a very good impression on me, and if it develops along this path, it will be better than the Japanese parliament." (Dentsu News Agency Dispatch, Eighth Day)</p>
<p>Proposals Concerning the Newspaper Industry</p>
<p>Chen Jieshi, a representative from Hunan, plans to propose a bill to lift various restrictions on the news</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>industry and to assist its development (Reason): Democratic politics is based on public opinion, and newspapers are the center of public opinion. Whether the newspaper industry of a country is developed or not can reflect whether the democratic politics of a country is consolidated. Everyone knows the importance of its relationship. In the past, the laws and regulations of various countries had many restrictions on newspapers, with some adopting prior intervention and others taking post-event punitive measures, and it was difficult to expect the development of the industry when there were so many restrictions. Therefore, the latest legislation in modern times all recognizes the absolute freedom of speech and publication, and is not subject to any other laws and regulations other than ordinary criminal law. During the autocratic era of the Manchus in our country, the newspaper law was promulgated to restrict freedom of speech, and it was soon revised after it had been in force for a short period of time. The government of the Northern Warlords continued to rise and promulgated the so-called Newspaper Regulations, which were strictly restricted and opposed and were finally abolished in the fifth year of the Republic of China. It is known that restricting public opinion is not only something that cannot be suppressed by facts, but also is not allowed in theory. When the revolutionary army rose up, the Communist bandits manipulated the newspaper industry, which was severely devastated. After the establishment of the National Government, on the one hand, it realized the ambition of the reactionary warlords and, on the other hand, warned against the frenzied barking of the Communist bandits, so it slightly cracked down on newspapers, which was an expedient measure and was not unavoidable. Now that the country is unified and society is stable, journalists from all over the country should abide by Chairman Chiang's New Year's Day telegram last year and do their best to meet the demands of the people. However, some local governments still use the pretext of suppressing reactionaries or facilitating military affairs to impose many restrictions on public opinion, closing down newspaper offices, arresting reporters, or censoring news, or ordering the payment of deposits, or detaining newspapers, or canceling registrations. As a result, the government will be ignorant on top and public opinion will be blocked below, cultivating a flattering style and turning to accidental disasters. What is convenient for the present is small, but what is detrimental to the future is great. Is it not only not a benefit to the government, but also a hidden worry for the country? Therefore, the proposal is as follows (1) Freedom of speech and publication shall be restricted only by ordinary criminal law, and the government shall not formulate any laws or regulations to restrict it. The promulgated publication law shall be repealed. (2) If a newspaper office or reporter has an illegal act, the newspaper office shall not be closed or the reporter arrested without a court ruling. (3) News shall not be censored or newspapers detained without the permission of the Central Party Headquarters. (4) News telegrams shall be sent in advance and telegram fees shall be reduced. (5) The government shall support the development of communication agencies engaged in international propaganda and subsidize their expenses. (6) In order to collect news from all over the country, transportation agencies shall issue half-price certificates for newspaper reporters to ride trains, ships, and airplanes.

<p>Sino-Japanese Legal Negotiations</p>
<p>A Discussion with K. Shigemitsu</p>
<p>Acting Representative Shigemitsu will attend Foreign Minister Wang's banquet tonight and will take the midnight train back to Shanghai. Regarding the legal rights negotiations, he told reporters that since the Chinese side announced the suspension of legal rights negotiations with Britain and the United States on May 4 and promulgated the Regulations on the Administration of Foreign Nationals in China, which will be implemented on January 1 of next year, the Chinese side's original intention was not to discontinue the negotiations thereafter, and there seems to be room for further negotiations. Britain and the United States also hope to reopen negotiations, and the Chinese side also intends to continue the negotiations. It is expected that negotiations will reopen. Although the Chinese side seems to regard Japan as a treaty expiration nation, Japan does not view it this way and will continue to negotiate as before. In the past, it was only a summary, but in the future, it will gradually become more concrete. As for Japan's countermeasures, Japan believes that China and Japan have special, close, and complex interests, and they should be harmonized and resolved. Therefore, Japan's countermeasures are slightly different from those of Britain and the United States, but there are also many similarities. In short, Japan is based on the shifting of the times and the actual situation, and will strive to meet the hopes of the Chinese government and people and seek a solution to the legal rights issue from an independent standpoint. The issue of the Chuanshi Mountain Landing Line on the Fuzhou-Danshui line is currently being negotiated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is expected to be resolved soon. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shigemitsu's visit to Nanjing was to discuss the Sino-Japanese legal rights incident and to make a detailed presentation of the Japanese government's views on legal rights. Because Foreign Minister Wang has been attending the National Assembly for days, he has not had time for in-depth discussions. Shigemitsu took the night train to Shanghai on the eighth and is scheduled to come to Beijing next week to discuss the matter. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Kailuan Coal Mine Dispute</p>
<p>Tianjin Beining Road and Kailuan disputes Recently, the inside story of the investigation heard that the Kailuan side did not raise conditions for the Beining Road to refuse to consider it Only the road side did not conduct consultations and carried out the shutdown, and the mine side sacrificed in pain and was unwilling to give in Therefore, the two sides could not approach and it was difficult to solve. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Kailuan Mining Bureau in Tianjin once planned to suspend work for four months but failed. Recently, it announced that it would suspend work for two days a week on the pretext that Beining had too much good coal due to the suspension of transportation. The General Labor Union of the mine sent a letter to the Mining Bureau on the seventh opposing the suspension of work and sent a letter to the provincial and municipal authorities and the provincial and municipal party headquarters on the eighth to stop the suspension of work and issued a statement to all circles, stating briefly that the difficulty of transportation is the result of their own making. During the seventeen years of military books and transportation interruptions, each mine stored hundreds of thousands of tons of coal and did not suspend work. This time, the transportation was not completely interrupted, and the stored coal was less than two-tenths of the past. How could they announce a two-day suspension of work per week? Isn't it deliberately harming the workers? The most important thing for both labor and management is cooperation. Our association cannot bear to see both sides suffer and perish together. We hope that the proposal to suspend work will be withdrawn and we will reply within three days. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Reorganization of the French Concession Case</p>
<p>French Commissioners Have Not Yet Arrived in Beijing</p>
<p>The case of the reorganization of the French Concession in Shanghai has been discussed by specialists from both China and France to determine the reorganization plan. The French commissioner has not yet arrived in Beijing. The Chinese commissioners Xu Mo and Wu Kunwu are collecting the history of this case. It is said that the system of the Joint Court of the French Concession in Shanghai is different from that of the Joint Court of the former Public Concession. The French Concession has one juror. This juror is usually an official of the French Consulate. The current rules of judgment were promulgated in 1902. If both parties are Chinese citizens, the lawsuit is filed in the court where the defendant resides. If the plaintiff is a foreigner but not a French citizen and the defendant is a Chinese citizen residing in the Public Concession, the case is heard by the court of the Public Concession. If the plaintiff is a French citizen and the defendant is a Chinese citizen residing in the French Concession, the French Concession has the right to judge. If the plaintiff is a foreigner but not a French citizen and the defendant is a Chinese citizen residing in the French Concession, the case is under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession Court. If the plaintiff is a French citizen and the defendant is a Chinese citizen residing in the Public Concession, the case is tried by the French Concession Court. As for criminal cases, if the accuser is a foreigner but not a French citizen, the Public Concession Court has the right to try the case. If the accuser is a French citizen, the case is judged by the French Concession. This method almost completely deprives the human rights of Chinese citizens residing in the French Concession and urgently needs to be discussed and reformed. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sino-Russian Conference</h3>
<p>Negotiations Regarding Redemption of Railway</p>
<p>Disagreement on Valuation Issue</p>
<p>Karakhan Expresses Five Points Regarding Redemption</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The newly appointed special commissioner of the Central Government for the Sino-Russian Conference, Hu Shi-ze, secretary Lao Wei-xiu, and Mr. Hu's wife, a party of three, are scheduled to depart for Russia on the 3rd afternoon at 3:55 PM via the Eurasian Transport. They are expected to arrive in Moscow on May 11th. The sixth Sino-Russian conference is scheduled to be held on May 14th, and Mr. Hu will rush to attend. Qian Tai had telegraphed Moscow requesting leave of absence to return home for his father's funeral. However, Mr. Modest Ilyich Rubinstein (莫德惠) greatly desires that all newly appointed commissioners arrive as soon as possible so that the East Railway Group meeting can proceed step by step. Because Qian Tai is unable to go for the time being, a telegram has been sent to the Central Government requesting the appointment of another person to replace him so that they can go to Moscow as soon as possible. According to a certain important person here who received a letter from a member of the delegation, the current trend of the conference is that since the fourth meeting on April 21st, the focus has shifted to the issue of redeeming the Chinese Eastern Railway. Although there are many issues regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, the redemption is the primary matter. If this is resolved, the other issues will be resolved as well. However, there are many difficulties in the redemption issue. Our side insists on using the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian agreements, as well as the construction contract of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the funds invested by the Russo-Asiatic Bank to establish the Chinese Eastern Railway Company as the basis for negotiating the price. The Russian side indicates that the valuation of the entire railway must be based on the original construction cost according to the construction contract, and the value of the property added over the years must first be investigated. After obtaining the total amount, it will be converted into the current price. However, how can the property of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which is vast like the sea, be investigated clearly? This is also a problem. Therefore, at the meeting on April 21st, the Russian side proposed that a special committee discuss the valuation issue, and another special committee be organized to investigate the property of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Members should be sent by both China and Russia to investigate the Chinese Eastern Railway. While this is being done, time should be freed up to carry out the issues of resumption of diplomatic relations and trade. Our representatives felt that the process was too slow and did not agree. It is said that at the fifth meeting on April 29th, the telegram received here reported that the meeting started at 6:00 PM that afternoon and ended at 11:00 PM. The discussion was still about the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. Russian representative Karakhan raised several points: (1) What currency should be used for the redemption? (2) Will China borrow foreign debt to redeem the railway? (3) Installment payments or total payment? (4) How should the Chinese Eastern Railway be managed before the price is fully paid? Will the Chinese and Russian personnel remain the same? (5) What is the interval between installment payments? These prompts are more urgent than before. Modest Ilyich Rubinstein (莫德惠) found it difficult to respond immediately and telegraphed the Central Government for instructions, promising to respond at the sixth meeting. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Handling the Aftermath in Bandit Areas on the Henan-Hubei Border</h3>
<p>Tragic Situation After Robbery in Qiliping and Other Places</p>
<p>He and Duan's Factions Are Surrounded</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Fourth Army of the Red Bandits, led by Kuang Jixun, previously disturbed the Xinji and Qiliping areas on the Henan-Hubei border, burning, killing, looting, and using all kinds of extreme measures. Subsequently, troops led by Ji Hongchang, Zhang Yinxiang, Ge Yunlong, and others advanced in several directions and successively recovered the various places of Bopi River, Xinji, and Qiliping. After receiving the report, Commander-in-Chief Jiang recognized the courageous efforts of the Ji, Zhang, and Ge divisions in suppressing the bandits and issued a telegram on the 6th ordering the Wuhan Headquarters to allocate 30,000 yuan to reward them. Telegrams were also sent to the governments of Hubei and Henan provinces, urging them to quickly send personnel to handle the aftermath. The telegram stated: "Hankou, Chairman He Xue-zhu, Kaifeng, Chairman Liu Jing-fu: According to Governor Li's 30th telegram, Bopi River, Xinji, and Qiliping have all been recovered successively and are currently planning to advance and suppress the Red Bandits in Xuanhua Shop. However, reports have repeatedly stated that the above-mentioned places have been occupied by Red Bandits for a long time, and the people have fled. Although announcements have been issued to recruit refugees, the houses have been destroyed and there are no grains left. The cries on the roads are extremely pitiful. If measures are not taken to pacify them quickly, the hidden worries are deep. Please telegraph the governments of Henan and Hubei provinces to quickly send personnel to handle the aftermath so that the party, government, and military can advance together to achieve fundamental results." In addition to replying by telegram, it is hoped that this will be followed. After receiving the order, the Hubei Provincial Government has sent Zhou Zun, Zhan Jian-da, and Xiao Chong-xun to handle it.</p>
<p>The Red Bandits in Western Hubei are divided into two factions, one is He Long's faction and the other is Duan Dechang's faction. They have long been defeated by the combined forces of the Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan armies. The remnants of He's troops, about 4,000 men with half the number of guns, are now surrounded in the Maliangping area bordering Nanzhang and Baokang. The remnants of Duan's bandits are lurking on the border of Hunan and Hubei. Their fake Jiangyou Army has fled to the Dongting Lake, Datong Lake, and Duoganzhou areas. The fake Jiangzuo Army, led by Duan's remaining troops, has fled to Jianli Chibakou, Guanyinzhou, and Bailu Lake. When He's bandits were surrounded, Duan led his bandits and attempted to flee north through the west side of Qiancheng to join He's bandits. They were fiercely attacked by the troops of the newly编 Second Brigade, Xu Dezuo's troops, who were stationed in Xiongkoushi, Lianhuasi, and Diaohongmiaochang. The brave squads selected from the First and Third Regiments also responded in several directions and fought hard for four days, finally defeating the bandits and forcing them to flee back to the southeastern area of Bailu Lake. The remnants of He's bandits are being besieged by the troops of Fan Shisheng and Wang Guangzong. Fan telegraphed Hankou yesterday to report on the progress of the suppression. (May 6th)</p>
<h3>Baohua Mountain</h3>
<p>Huiju Temple Restores Original Name of Longchang Temple</p>
<p>Dai Jitao Writes Record of Renaming</p>
<p>Baohua Mountain in the capital has beautiful scenery and is a famous scenic spot in the suburbs of the capital. Many tourists visit throughout the four seasons. There is a large temple on the mountain that can accommodate thousands of people. The temple has more than 800 monks and is named Huiju Temple. The temple was built by Zen Master Miaofeng of the Ming Dynasty. Last month, Examination Institute Director Dai Jitao was recuperating here and studied the historical origins of the temple. It originated with Zen Master Zhigong, and Zen Master Miaofeng laid the foundation for the temple. Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty bestowed the name Huguo Shenghua Longchang Temple. In the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, it was renamed Huiju Temple. Director Dai believes that the name Longchang has a broader meaning and has historical significance, so he consulted with the abbot of the temple and decided to restore the original name. He personally wrote the plaque for the temple gate and wrote a record of the temple's renaming, which was engraved on stone. Yesterday was the day the temple held the renaming ceremony. Director Dai was unable to attend the ceremony in person due to attending the National Assembly, so he sent Secretary Song Shi of the Ministry of Personnel as his representative. On that day, more than 400 people from the temple, more than 500 new initiates, and more than 300 male and female lay Buddhists who came to receive the precepts all gathered in the Grand Hall of the Great Hero at 10:00 AM in the rain. The retired abbot of the temple, Guanghuang, presided over the ceremony: (1) Stand at attention (2) Praise the Buddha (3) Burn incense. After about half an hour, the unveiling ceremony of the plaque of Longchang Temple was held. The chairman led the masses to bow three times to the national flag, the party flag, the portrait of the Prime Minister, and the statue of the Buddha. After the chairman reported on the process of the renaming, Secretary Song, on behalf of Director Dai, unveiled the plaque and delivered a congratulatory speech. Then, guest Luo Yisun delivered a speech, and then the ceremony ended.</p>
<h3>Ancient Artifacts of the Song Dynasty Discovered in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Many Brick Tablets, Porcelain, and Ancient Coins</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department recently constructed the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Tower in the Zhongshan Road Dashikou intersection in Zhenjiang and sent craftsmen to work. At about 1:00 PM on the 7th, workers suddenly discovered a large stone about three feet long while excavating the soil. When the stone was broken by the workers, two brick tablets, like squares, were excavated. The characters engraved on them were lively and impressive. The ancient text on the brick tablet was titled "(Song Fang Newly Built Cross Street Initially Well Record)" Below was "(Great Song Chunhua Three Years, Year in Ren Chen Month, When Zhong Lü Sixteenth Day Record)" The name was "(Taizhou Changle Temple寄潤州慈和寺Wishing to build a street Monk Daocheng Cihe Temple Abbot Living Wukong Chan Great Virtue Huilang)" The ancient text on the other tablet was titled "(Runzhou Built Dashi Pu Street Association Chief Donor Name)" Three ancient porcelains shaped like watermelons, seemingly used for dipping ink, were found under the brick tablet, along with more than 2,000 ancient coins of a dark green color. After they were all moved out, the workers stopped excavating and transported the antiques to the Construction Department. Many people came to see them for a while. There were still large stones and antiques underground, which the Construction Department covered with large wood and sent police to guard, preparing to continue excavating today (8th).</p>

<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Bail of Defendant in Theft Case On the 23rd of last month, a female corpse was found in the Xiuye Bridge River. Her father, Zhang Junqi, identified her as his daughter. On the 17th, she had gone to the Hua Lou Tea House owned by her aunt's husband, Wu Jingqing, to visit her aunt. After returning home, her aunt called her again, saying that she had lost 200 cents in small silver coins. The girl unbuttoned her clothes to show her innocence. Afterwards, her father scolded her at home. The next day, she left home without saying goodbye and disappeared without a trace until her corpse was found in the Xiuye Bridge River. After the coroner's examination, Zhang Junqi filed a lawsuit with the prosecutor's office against Wu Jingqing and his wife, saying that Wu and others falsely accused her of theft, causing her to die of shame and indignation. Subsequently, the prosecutor's office summoned both parties for questioning and ordered the defendants Wu Jingqing and his wife to be held pending further investigation. It is now known that the prosecutor's office has summoned the Hua Lou manager and other witnesses for questioning today. The defendant stated that the niece did prepare to undress to show her innocence, but he stopped her and had no doubts or coercion. Otherwise, it would have caused public outrage at a time when there were many tea guests. He asked for a clear investigation. The witnesses also stated the circumstances they saw at the time. After careful verification by the prosecutor, the defendant was ordered to be released on bail.</p>
<p>Recent News from Jiufeng Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Factory The Jiufeng Seed Manufacturing Factory in Songjiang was founded by Li Bijun, a graduate of the Huxuguan Jiangsu Provincial Girls' Sericulture School. The silkworm seeds produced over the years have been sold in various places and have a good reputation. Last year, the original silkworm room was insufficient, so a large amount of money was raised this spring to expand it. A new-style silkworm room was built on the Xiaocang Bridge embankment outside the west gate, and more than 50 mu of barren land were purchased to plant mulberry seedlings. The technicians hired are all experienced in seed production. In addition to entrusting sericulture organizations to sell the products this spring, various merchants in other places have placed orders with the factory. This is also a good phenomenon in the Songjiang industrial sector.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Resolution of the Wooden Loom Workers' Strike The strike by wooden loom workers in Suzhou due to the reduction of wages by employers has lasted for several days. Yesterday (8th), the county government convened a meeting of labor and management to mediate. The employer representatives were Shi Junqing, Yu Wenqing, Gu Anzhi, and Xu Xiaozhai, representing the silk and satin shops. The labor representatives were Huang Zixin and others, representing the wooden loom silk weaving union. The agenda included (1) Please restore the original wage scale immediately. It was resolved that both labor and management should abide by the original wage scale and not reduce it privately from now on. (2) The wages previously reduced by the employers should be compensated according to the original scale. It was resolved that after the original wage scale is restored, any reductions will be compensated according to the scale. It was decided that since the employers' business was declining, no compensation would be given for previous reductions. It was also decided that the price of the satin work of the Sanqiang Yanghang, which was not listed in the original table, was 25 cents per foot and 16 cents per foot for 12,000 locks.</p>

<p>Closing Arguments in the Lu Xueren Bigamy Case Lu Xueren, a 44-year-old rent accountant in Run'an Lane, Run'an Fang, Zhabei, Shanghai, met a Ningbo woman named Zhao Baobao, 26, at the Tianyun Tower of the Wing On Company on the evening of March 11th of the lunar calendar in the 18th year of the Republic of China. They became close and developed a love affair. That night, Lu accompanied Zhao Baobao to a hotel and then moved to the Gaoyu Lane residence together on the 16th of the same month. Afterwards, they moved to No. 219 Yanji Lane, Xiamen Road. On June 11th of the lunar calendar last year, Zhao Baobao secretly took Lu's clothes and other belongings and ran away. Lu immediately reported it to the police and sued Zhao Baobao for running away with stolen goods at the Special District Court. The verdict was not accepted. After the verdict, Zhao Baobao filed a counterclaim with the Shanghai District Court, accusing Lu of bigamy. In the past month, Lu Xueren was found not guilty. The prosecutor refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal. Yesterday (8th), Judge Lin of the First Criminal Division of the High Court held a hearing and summoned the appellant Lu Xueren, the plaintiff Zhao Baobao, and the witnesses Feng Sunshi, Chang Rensheng, and He Suzhen. Lu Xueren testified that Zhao Baobao was a mistress. Zhao Baobao testified that she had married Lu and invited guests. The testimonies of the witnesses Feng Sunshi and others were contradictory. Prosecutor Zhu Wenzhuo then advised that it would be quite beneficial to the appellant and hoped that the court would reject the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's appeal. Judge Lin then ordered the closing arguments and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 11th of this month.</p>

<p>Two Fires in One Day There is a Panfeng Elementary School in Panfeng, the 16th district (Wananshi). The school belongs to the third school district and is isolated in the fields. Unfortunately, a fire broke out late the night before due to carelessness, resulting in the teacher's office, school worker's office, and preparation room being completely destroyed. The loss is about 500 yuan. The Wangzhuang Elementary School is using the ancestral hall of the Lu family as a school building. Unexpectedly, it also caught fire accidentally the night before, immediately breaking through the roof. After the gongs were sounded to warn and the fire was put out, the building was extinguished. It is said that the previously built houses of the ancestral hall have been burned down, with a loss of 400 to 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Elevator in Yarn Factory Crushes Child Laborer Xiao Sanzi, a 14-year-old child laborer from Jiangbei in the fine yarn room of the Shenxin Third Factory outside the west gate of the county, was working the night shift at the factory the day before. Xu A'gen, a machine worker in the same room, needed clean water for work and ordered Xiao Sanzi to fetch water from the water tank. Xiao Sanzi took the elevator downstairs. Unfortunately, his head was accidentally crushed into the elevator, and his head and body were separated instantly. The scene was so tragic that people couldn't bear to look at it. Afterwards, the factory owner Rong Desheng posted an obituary with a coffin and funeral fee of 100 yuan. The workers and the Shenxin Union also raised 102 yuan to deliver to the deceased's mother to show their sympathy.</p>
<p>Wang Borong Accused of Neglecting Duty Wang Yiren, a resident of the World Bookstore in Wangmiao Lane, Chengzhong, developed a disease during pregnancy on March 21st. He hired Wang Borong, a Chinese medicine doctor at Yingqiao Zhongxi Hospital, to treat her. Wang mistakenly identified the fetus as blood bloating, resulting in the delivery of twin babies. After childbirth, Qi's condition worsened and her life was in danger. In anger, Yiren filed a lawsuit with the county court, accusing him of neglecting his duty and causing death due to negligence. Because the conditions were not met, Judge Liang rejected the case. Wang Yiren then hired a lawyer yesterday to write a statement in accordance with Article 291, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office, requesting permission to summon and punish Chinese medicine doctor Wang Borong to respect human life.</p>

<p>Truth About Merchants' Strike in Houcheng In the second district, merchants in Houcheng Township funded and hired a Jianghu opera troupe to perform Peking Opera for two days on the 3rd and 4th. It was also approved by Huang Zhifang, the director of the third branch of the Public Security Bureau. On the 5th, merchants planned to continue performing for one day to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the late Prime Minister's inauguration as the Provisional President and to celebrate the opening of the National Assembly. Director Huang did not allow it and strictly prohibited it. He detained Liu Tongsou, the head of the opera troupe, and merchants Shen Jiasheng, Guo Hanwen, Yang Hansheng, and others. The oars and boxes of the boat were also taken to the bureau. That night, Director Huang sent two patrol officers to patrol the streets to see if ignorant villagers would beat the patrol officers. The patrol officers returned to the bureau to report, and Huang sent police to detain Chen Xianghan, a private school teacher, claiming that he was the one who shouted. The merchants were very opposed to the private torture. Yesterday (7th), they went on strike and organized the "Support Chen Support Association." 300 merchants held a meeting and paraded through the streets, posting slogans on the streets stating "Private torture of good people, willing to stop business" and unanimously refused to pay the police donations. Chen Erchang, the district chief of the second district, mediated without success. Director Huang then called the headquarters, and Director Chen immediately sent Ma Huaizhong, the captain of the fourth police squad stationed in Wangjiadai, to suppress the merchants. The merchants planned to file a complaint with the Ministry of Civil Affairs and were waiting for County Magistrate Li to inspect Qingxiang District Administration today (8th). When he arrived in Houcheng from Yangku, the crowd petitioned him, stating that the merchants would not resume business unless Huang was dismissed and investigated. The outcome is unknown.</p>
<p>Bandit Jiang Yinsheng Executed by Firing Squad Jiang Yinsheng (ie Jiang Fa) from Xuejiatan Village, Xuecao Township, 6th District, was a member of the Gao Xiaosheng Party who has already been executed. On September 28th of last year, he kidnapped Xue Zuochu's farmhand, Xue Xisheng, and Jiang Canlin, all from the same village, and then shot and killed the hostages while on the run. On the 20th of last month, he was arrested by the 6th Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Yangshupu, Shanghai, and extradited to Chengxian for interrogation. After Xue Jianwen listed the facts and provided evidence, the county government reported to the provincial government and received a telegram (6th) approving the death sentence. At 9:00 AM on the 7th, County Magistrate Li ordered the police to take the bandit Jiang to the west gate for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>The Big Sword Society is About to Spread to Villages The Big Sword Society bandits were previously discovered in Zhu Lane, Zhouzhuang Township, 8th District. After the county investigated, it was determined that they were farmers Zhou Runquan and others acting in self-defense. They were dealt with leniently. Unexpectedly, farmers Shen Jianting and Cheng Keming from more than ten villages including Shendian Village and Liuxiang Lane hired more than ten Big Sword Society teachers from Liyang to teach charms in various villages. Even many people on Zhoucun Street joined the society to practice, which may spread to various villages.</p>

After everything, the trial was adjourned, and Judge Zhong stood up and announced the main text, which stated that Cui Xinshan used his official power to intimidate people into handing over their property. He was sentenced to two years of fixed-term imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan. If he was unable to pay after compulsory execution, he would be imprisoned for one day for every three yuan. He would be deprived of his civil rights for five years. The number of days of unconfirmed detention was one day for every two yuan. The other parts were not guilty.

<p>Detective Team Arrests Six Kidnappers The detective team of the Provincial Public Security Bureau inspected the shantytowns in Baota Lane the day before. Detective Xu Zhaorong and Zhang Jichuan discovered Wu Deshan, who looked suspicious. They immediately took him to the team headquarters for interrogation. According to his confession, Han Tongyou (ie Han San) colluded with twelve kidnappers on April 15th to kidnap a 17 or 18-year-old boy from the Sun family in Gaotian Township, east of Yangzhou Bridge. Afterwards, they fled to Wuxi and entrusted Zhang Ganquan to contact them in Zhenjiang for the ransom. The detectives were ordered to investigate and successively arrested Zhang Ganquan, Xu Rongfang, Han Dongshan, Wang Huairong, and Wang Wangshi. They were sent to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Salary Demands by Elementary School Teachers Rise Again The salaries of elementary school teachers in this county are extremely low, so the teachers and staff of each elementary school are extremely poor. However, the Education Bureau has been in arrears for as long as March and often proposes to reduce it. The teachers and staff are suffering and gathered at the Public Education Center at 3:00 PM the day before to discuss ways to demand their salaries. Three conditions were proposed (1) Salaries cannot be shortened (2) Arrears should be paid in advance (3) Education bonds should be paid monthly. After the decision, they requested Director Shi Yuanmo to attend and reply. Director Shi refused to attend, claiming that he had something to do. Finally, the teachers and staff went to the Education Bureau to negotiate with Shi for six hours without any resolution. It was not until after 10:00 PM that the bureau staff responded as follows: (1) The February salary will not be shortened and will be paid in full (2) Arrears will be paid every twenty days (3) Bonds will be paid at 10% per month from February. The teachers and staff felt satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<p>Several People Died in the Broken Bridge Tragedy The floating bridge (Longjin Bridge) outside the south gate of Luhe is an important transportation route with thousands of pedestrians coming and going every day. Decades ago, the bridge had an accident that injured and killed dozens of people. Unexpectedly, continuous heavy rain caused mountain floods and a huge surge of water. At about 10:00 AM this morning (7th), the bridge railing suddenly broke, and the bridge drifted with the water. The pedestrians ran for their lives, and there were as many as eight people who fell into the water. Only three people were rescued, and the rest were buried in the fish's belly. It was also said to be a tragedy.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Using Religious Textbooks</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education ordered the education bureaus of each province and city to instruct all primary schools to prohibit the use of religious textbooks. The order stated: "The Ministry previously investigated the case of the Fuzhou Cangqian Mountain issuing religious textbooks for primary schools, and ordered the Fujian Provincial Education Bureau to investigate and reply. The reply stated that the schools using the primary religious textbooks published by a certain National Sacred Book Association on Cangqian Mountain in Fuzhou were to be investigated and reported to the Ministry. Therefore, the Ministry immediately sent personnel to secretly purchase them from the association and submitted them to the Bureau. The Bureau found that the contents of the books were mostly propaganda of religion, which greatly contradicted the purpose of national education. The Bureau immediately sent personnel to various church schools in the provincial capital and issued a detailed secret investigation to the education bureaus of each county, strictly prohibiting their use. The Bureau would submit a separate report. It is now submitting eight volumes of primary religious textbooks for primary schools for review, in addition to the fact that all the books have been reviewed. The Ministry issued the "Provisional Standards for Primary School Curriculum," which does not include a religious subject. The National Sacred Book Association's publication of religious textbooks with the words "Primary School Level" written on the cover is extremely absurd. The contents not only promote religion but also contain political colors. For example, lesson 16 in the third volume and lesson 4 in the sixth volume clearly contain the meaning of not resisting the aggression of any imperialists. This violates nationalism and anesthetizes children. It should be strictly prohibited from being issued, and its use should be stopped. The printed books should be sealed and the printing plates destroyed to prevent circulation and avoid misleading people. In addition to ordering all primary schools in the country to prohibit the use of the book, you are also to comply with the instructions and report the compliance to the Ministry for verification."</p>
<h3>On the Opinions of Tai Shuangqiu and Others Regarding the National Education Chapter of the Draft Provisional Constitution</h3>
<p>Tai Shuangqiu, Cheng Qibao, Wang Shulin, Liu Zhendong, Xia Zhanchu, Li Qingsong, and two thousand eight hundred and eighty-four others have submitted a signed register of opinions on the National Education Chapter of the draft provisional constitution of the National Assembly to the Secretariat of the National Assembly. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>With the conclusion of military affairs and the beginning of political tutelage, the National Government, in accordance with the will of the Premier, convened the National Assembly in the capital to deliberate and decide on the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. The draft, which has been passed by the Central Plenary Provisional Meeting, seems to have areas that are still open to consideration regarding the National Education Chapter. We respectfully submit the following points for discussion by the representatives attending the meeting and request that they be adopted:</p>
<p>A. Original Text of the National Education Chapter of the Draft Provisional Constitution (Chapter Five): Article 45: The Three Principles of the People shall be the fundamental principle of education in the Republic of China. Article 46: Men and women shall have equal opportunities for education. Article 47: All public and private educational institutions throughout the country shall be subject to national supervision and shall have the obligation to promote the national educational policies set by the state. Article 48: All children of school age shall be subject to compulsory education, the details of which shall be determined by law. Article 49: The state shall provide adult remedial education to people who have not received compulsory education. Article 50: The central and local governments shall raise the necessary funds for education and shall guarantee the independence of educational funds by law. Article 51: The state shall reward and protect school teachers and staff who have excellent performance and have served in their positions for a long time. Article 52: All public and private schools throughout the country shall set up free scholarships to reward students with excellent character and academics who are unable to afford further education. Article 53: The state shall reward and protect academic and technical research and inventions. Article 54: The state shall protect or preserve historical sites and cultural and artistic relics.</p>
<p>B. Criticisms and Suggestions: 1. The people of the Republic of China shall have the right to education. Explanation: (1) The wording of Article 48 (compulsory education) of the original text seems inappropriate. If the people's education is purely viewed from the state's perspective, it can be regarded as an obligation, but from the people's perspective, it is the enjoyment of a right. The state exists for the people, so the latter meaning should be the standard. The Premier clearly stipulated in the Law on the Implementation of Local Autonomy that all young men and women in autonomous regions shall have the right to education, which is consistent with this meaning. Therefore, the original text of the draft should be revised according to this article. 2. The state shall be responsible for establishing education. Explanation: The evolution of education has gone from (private ownership, private governance, private enjoyment) to (public ownership, public governance, public enjoyment). Therefore, the state should be fully responsible for educational facilities in the future. If the state is only in a supervisory position with regards to education as stipulated in Article 47 of the original text, it would be equivalent to reducing the state's responsibility for education, which is not what our people expect from the state. Therefore, the original text of Article 47 of the draft should be revised according to this article. 3. Equal educational opportunities; children's admission to higher education should be based on talent and aspirations, and the state should be fully responsible for their development. Explanation: Article 46 of the original draft stipulates (equal educational opportunities for men and women). Our customs value men over women, and it is necessary to remedy the inequality of educational opportunities between men and women. However, looking at the distribution of educational opportunities nationwide, there are many inequalities, such as the inequality of educational opportunities between children from wealthy and poor families, the inequality of educational opportunities between children from urban and rural areas, the inequality of educational opportunities for children from different social statuses, and the establishment of schools by certain clans in patriarchal societies to exclude children from other clans, and the establishment of schools by those who believe in certain religions to exclude children who believe in other religions, etc., are all phenomena of unequal educational opportunities. Legislators should pay attention to these at the same time and remedy them so that all children in the country can have the opportunity to receive education and fully develop their talents. The meaning of Article 46 of the draft is too narrow and fails to take into account the overall situation, so it should be revised according to this article. 4. All levels of schools nationwide should be exempt from tuition fees. Explanation: Since education is a right of the people, all expenses should be borne by the public. Therefore, the Premier advocated (tuition, books, and the clothing and food of students should be provided by the public). However, it has been found that schools in the country have been charging more and more fees in recent years, especially private schools, which have no restrictions. Many families in poverty are unable to afford them, and educational opportunities are gradually being monopolized by the wealthy, leading to social unrest. In order to remedy this, it should be stipulated that all public and private schools nationwide should be exempt from tuition fees. When the national economy is sufficient, fees for books, clothing, and food should be gradually exempted in order to realize the Premier's will. Article 52 of the original draft only stipulates (setting up free scholarships), which seems inappropriate and should be revised. 5. The central government should be responsible for raising and guaranteeing educational funding, striving for equitable burdens and fair distribution, and determining national educational funds to subsidize impoverished provinces. Explanation: (1) The basic principle of educational funding is (using social funds to run social education), and in practice, emphasis should be placed on equitable burdens and fair distribution. In terms of regions, educational funding in our country is generally the responsibility of local governments, resulting in an uneven distribution of wealth and extreme disparities in prosperity and hardship. In terms of types, most of the funds come from land taxes, salt taxes, and other harsh taxes and miscellaneous donations, harming the poor and impoverished people. In order to remedy this, the central government should (1) unify the collection of educational funds nationwide and fairly distribute them according to the educational needs of each region, based on the principle of (using social funds to run social education); (2) formulate a fair educational tax system and exempt all harsh and detailed educational miscellaneous donations; (3) utilize surplus assets, such as temple properties without proper uses and large inheritances obtained by private individuals without labor, and appropriately allocate them to national educational funds. (2) Although guaranteeing the independence of educational funding is included in the Party platform, our goal is only to seek sufficient educational funding and to have it guaranteed. Whether educational funding should be independent in the future depends on the state's financial management situation. It does not seem necessary to make such a rigid stipulation in the Provisional Constitution. Moreover, the state has the overall responsibility for planning the development of education, and its responsibility is not only to guarantee the independence of the fund. The stipulation in Article 50 of the original draft does not seem to enable the state to fulfill its due responsibility for education, so that article should be revised according to this article. 6. Educational personnel should have professional training, and their status and lives should be protected by law. Explanation: (1) Educational personnel should have professional training, which is one of the trends in modern education. Those who stipulate the Provisional Constitution should not neglect this. (2) Article 51 of the original draft only mentions school teachers and staff, which is too narrow in scope, so it should be changed to (educational personnel). (3) The difficult lives of those engaged in education have long been recognized by countries around the world. The state should enact laws to protect their status and should not dismiss them without proper procedures. It should also protect their lives, such as salaries, health and recreational expenses, children's education expenses, housing expenses, accident and danger expenses, retirement and death pensions, etc., all of which should be specially stipulated. The Education Provisional Constitution is a fundamental plan for building national education, and its relationship to the development of the Party and the country is profound and significant. We dare to refer to the trends in world education and consider the domestic political, economic, and social situation, and list the above opinions for reference. Please examine them in detail.</p>
<h3>Japan</h3>
<p>Job Placement Amidst Economic Recession</p>
<p>(Special Correspondence from Shinsosha)</p>
<p>In recent years, Japan has been plagued by sluggish overseas markets and the decline of various industries, leading to widespread cries of "economic recession" across the nation. The cries of unemployed youth can be heard everywhere, indicating the severity of the situation. Japanese authorities are paying close attention to this, with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Tokyo Municipal Social Bureau proposing concrete plans for relief. The sole relief agency is the job placement office, with 325 offices nationwide, a number unmatched by any other country in the world. The Tokyo Regional Job Placement Bureau has jurisdiction over 115 offices (50 in Tokyo), the Osaka Regional Job Placement Bureau over 77 offices, the Nagoya Regional Job Placement Bureau over 43 offices, the Fukuoka Regional Job Placement Bureau over 39 offices, and the Aomori Regional Job Placement Bureau over 51 offices. On the 9th, the reporter made a special trip to the Central Job Placement Office and was impressed by the advanced state of registration. The reporter saw over 200 men and 80-90 women, their faces showing signs of weariness. Under the guidance of Mr. Hisataka Kubo, the officer in charge, the reporter was satisfied with the entire office. The office is organized into four departments: job requests, job seekers, liaison, and general affairs, with 35 staff members. Staff in each department were busy checking applications and conducting interviews, but the organization was complete and there was no sign of chaos. Various job requests and job seeker profiles were categorized and filed in an orderly manner, making it easy to check. According to Director Kubo, the most common opportunities are in engineering, followed by commerce, American businesses, and domestic services for women. Opportunities in liberal arts, politics, and economics are more difficult to find. However, each office is interconnected, and the liaison department sends two or three staff members to various agencies every day to promote opportunities. Although job opportunities for women are highly developed, most women hold subordinate positions, while many women hope to become department store clerks or telegraph operators. Even male elementary school students have this hope. Regarding the guarantee layer, the Social Bureau has a labor mutual aid association with a membership fee of one yuan, which can cover six months of liability. There is also a one-day membership for general casual laborers, with a daily fee of two cents. The Tokyo Municipal Placement Office spends a total of 350,000 yuan each year. It also runs simple cafeterias and public lodgings for the unemployed to alleviate the burden on those who have not yet found work. The Railway Bureau and shipping companies offer half-price fares to facilitate travel for those seeking work in distant places. The municipal authorities are doing everything possible for the unemployed. In contrast, what can our country do? Because the office is run by the municipality, it does not charge job seekers any fees. It even lends travel expenses to facilitate their travel. In 1930, there were 48,074 job requests, 79,012 job seekers, 42,469 introductions, and 12,101 successful placements. Mr. Kubo, who is over 50 years old, earnestly shared these facts, and it is clear that he is dedicated to social service. The reporter then visited the Women's and Youth Job Placement Office, also run by the municipality, which specializes in guiding young people and women in their studies and employment. It uses medical and psychological methods to diagnose and examine their abilities and physical condition to meet the needs of the job market. Under the guidance of Mr. Ono Iwahiko, the director of the office, the reporter was impressed by the youth counseling department, the aptitude testing department, and the women's counseling department. There are over 100 types of aptitude testing equipment. Its services include vocational guidance, job placement, protection and supervision, aptitude testing, and various consultations (vocational counseling, educational counseling, health counseling), research and investigation, and six items. In 1928, an agreement was reached with the Municipal Education Bureau, the Social Bureau, and other related parties that the office would be responsible for the job placement of elementary school children in Tokyo. Every year in November and December, the office sends staff to various schools to conduct on-site surveys of the interests, aptitudes, temperaments, abilities, and aspirations of children who wish to work, and provides a detailed analysis. January of each year is the time for various employment agencies to hire personnel. Mr. Ono, a director of the National Vocational Guidance Association, is a vocational guidance expert with extensive experience and many publications. He spoke for about two hours and willingly presented many books, expressing his desire to maintain contact with vocational guidance agencies in our country. His sincere intentions are deeply appreciated.</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Give a Lecture on Tai Chi Exercises in Beijing</p>
<p>The Sino-French 19 Academic Study Mission Will Depart Soon</p>
<p>After attending the National Assembly in Beijing some days ago, Central Committee Member Chu Minyi returned to Shanghai yesterday morning on business. Mr. Chu is very filial to his parents. Since his father is over seventy years old and lives in Nanzun, his hometown, he often suffers from the loneliness of being far from his knees because he devotes himself to the party and the country. Recently, his father has been ill, and since Chu will be traveling to the Northwest for six months before he can return, he is very concerned about his elderly father. Therefore, this morning, he took his wife on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo train to return to his hometown to visit and bring joy to his parents. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the tenth and take the night train to Beijing on the eleventh to participate in the National Assembly and give a lecture on Tai Chi exercises. He will also be working on the Academic Study Mission and inspecting Party affairs in Xinjiang. Initially, the Sino-French 19 Academic Study Mission was delayed because the crawler's belt was damaged, causing it to stop. The belt has now been shipped from France, so Mr. Chu must go to Beijing to lead the mission to the Northwest for investigation.</p>

<h3>On the Panchen Lama</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The border region of Tibet is located far away in the uncivilized lands, traditionally beyond reach. Its location, with the Kunlun Mountains to the north and the Himalayas to the south, boasts an average altitude of 15,000 feet, making it the highest in the world. Long ago, Emperor Shun banished the San Miao people to the Sanwei Mountains, which are located in that area. Therefore, according to the Book of Yu, it has long been a part of the map. Since the Six Dynasties, although the Western Qiang rose up, by the mid-Tang Dynasty, they had even formed marriage alliances twice. Throughout the Song Dynasty, they were all subjects who did not rebel. During the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, their loyalty was diminished due to the veneration of the teachings of Tsongkhapa. However, during the Shunzhi and Kangxi periods of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, Tibet still had the authority of a "Fan Khan" (this "authority" differs from today's "legalist"). The Qing did not directly involve itself in general administration. Later, the region of Tibet was conquered by the army of Lhazang Khan of Qinghai, and the area under the jurisdiction of his eldest son, Erke Khan, became what was known as the "Panchen's" land. At that time, the Panchen Lama merely preserved a small territory for incense offerings and sustenance. In the 57th year of the Kangxi reign, the Sixth Dalai Lama's enthronement could not have been secured without the use of Chinese troops to support him. It was then that the entirety of Tibet was restored, and the legal authority of the Qing Dynasty was unified until today, with the hereditary title continuing uninterrupted. It is important to know that Tibet was not destroyed by foreign powers, following in the footsteps of India after the loss of the Jiva.</p>
<p>In May of the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Panchen Lama arrived in Beijing during the administration of Hefei, and presented a memorial at the Rehabilitation Conference, mainly arguing for the elimination of the scourge of war. Quoting the Buddhist teachings, he said: "The wise understand through parables." His profound and subtle words were greatly appreciated at the time. Later, when he traveled from Beijing to Shanghai, the war between Jiangsu and Zhejiang under Qi Xieyuan and Lu Yongxiang had just ended. Although the flames of war had subsided, the scars remained. The Panchen Lama also traveled to Zhejiang to visit this past sea of suffering, to attest to the future Bodhi. Therefore, those who heard his wonderful teachings were able to slightly dispel their delusions, which they felt was fortunate. Today's newspaper reports that the Panchen Lama and his entourage of 175 people arrived in Pukou by special train on the 4th. After crossing the river, they took specially prepared Meng-Hui vehicles and drove directly to the Xingyuan residence in Sanyuan Lane in Beijing. Although it is not yet certain whether he will attend the National Assembly, his sincerity in not daring to take lightly the allegiance to the mother country can already be seen in his presentation of the Hada. Followers of the Dragon Elephant and descendants of eminent clans should be like this, especially now that the National Assembly is open and they personally witness the grand event, and see the renewal and rejuvenation of national affairs. Their loyalty and reporting of their duties should be even more solemn than in the past. However, the power of religious belief today is no longer what it once was. The so-called wise often do not understand the truth, do not recognize reality, and are attached to false views, without enlightenment. Can the Panchen Lama, having seen this illusion, break through this net and save the masses from hell?</p>
<h3>Sincere Words</h3>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Waifeng has resided in Japan for many years and is proficient in several languages. He was recently appointed by the National Government as a commissioner of the China Merchants Bureau. As soon as the order was issued, visitors flocked to him, asking about his plans for the bureau. Mr. Guo replied, "Good governance doesn't require much talk. The China Merchants Bureau is now in a state of utter ruin. My appointment is to do what is known to be impossible. Therefore, the most important key is to be frugal." Those who came to visit knew that Mr. Guo's aim was to tighten spending, and they withdrew. Some said that the China Merchants Bureau is nearing its end, but if Mr. Guo sacrifices everything and strives for its recovery, perhaps a turning point can be found, and a new path can be opened for the bureau. (Yet to be rewarded)</p>
<h3>New Sights and News</h3>
<p>— Xu Bibo</p>
<p>Recently, the (Yu Meiren) sound film has been released in other areas. I have been traveling between Beijing and Shanghai, often going back and forth twice a week. I am ashamed that I am not like Yu the Great, who always dismounted and stayed briefly in Wu when passing through Wumen, also for the sake of the park cinema. However, in my busy travels, I have occasionally come across a few things that are worth noting. I have recorded them below in my spare time.</p>
<p>Six Inches of Round Skin Dyed Crimson. I happened to pass by Guanqian Street and saw that the sock shops were filled with blood-red silk stockings. I thought that this was acceptable as a decoration, but how could it be all red? Unexpectedly, after entering the park, I gradually found that most of the women walking by were wearing bright red stockings. The thick, bright colors wrapped around their ankles looked like they were soaked in fresh blood. My common eyes could not make a judgment or distinguish between them. Looking at their styles, there were students, young ladies, young mistresses, and social butterflies. I don't know what to call it, so I call it the "Suzhou Red Stocking Craze."</p>
<p>Pine Cranes and Gathered Zhicao. Suzhou has two unique shops: (1) Caizhi Zhai, a confectionery shop on Guanqian Street. There are dozens of confectionery shops, but Caizhi Zhai's storefront decoration is only third-rate, but its business is the most prosperous, with a monthly income of over 30,000. Among them, the melon seeds alone account for 70% of the income. Therefore, every night, more than ten employees are arranged at the counter to divide the work and pack various melon seeds and canned goods. The sound of "ku-da, ku-da" constantly shatters the good dreams of neighboring merchants. (2) Songhe Lou Restaurant is also located on Guanqian Street. All gourmets flock to it, regardless of day or night or wind or rain. It is always full of friends, and the wine cups are never empty, because it is cheap and delicious. However, there is a smoker who holds a long-mouthed water pipe and always shakes and smokes it in front of guests, which is very annoying. This is an old habit from more than ten years ago, but it has not yet been removed. Can Songhe Lou really prolong life?</p>
<p>Qin Fang can really be considered a person. The (Yu Meiren) film was shown in Suzhou for seven days. Although it rained, the results were not bad. More than a hundred people wept for this play. One day, several girls commented on Xu Qinfang, the star of the play, saying that she was so smart, talented in both literary and military arts, and had such a clever tongue and clear singing voice, that she could truly be considered a person. Their words showed that they were ashamed of being women and of being unknown. They truly felt wronged to be human beings.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Day Trip to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yun Shu, sent from Suzhou</p>
<p>It has been half a year since I left Chunjiang. Yesterday, I came to Shanghai with Lizhu for a day trip. As soon as the car dust settled, I wired my old friend Wu for lunch at Guanshengyuan. During the meal, Wu suggested visiting the Mingxing Film Company on Dumei Road. With plenty of time on the way back, Lizhu and I recounted what we saw during the day. I wrote it down to record this fleeting moment.</p>
<p>Entering the gate, the path is lined with lush flowers and trees that block out the sun. Following the winding glass shed, we saw a tall building reaching into the sky. Climbing the steps, the building had three floors. The second floor was the office, with each department well-organized. The first floor was the opera troupe, where they practiced singing every day. The walls were hung with portraits of famous actors, which were very bright and beautiful, and all served as consultants to the troupe. We visited the production department building, where the newly filmed (Hate Sea) was being edited. Although we only saw fragments of the film, we were able to see it early. We passed through the first studio, where the huge set of (Red Tears Shadow) was set up, a high-ceilinged and spacious Western-style house. It was very novel. Today's artists all pay attention to modern styles, drawing on the past and present to suit the entertainment of the eyes and ears. The beauty of European and American residences and palaces has recently tended towards a three-dimensional style. In recent years, domestic films such as (Peach Blossom Lake) have had magnificent and luxurious sets, and the film industry has spared no expense in creating works that also emphasize modernity. It is said that the famous director Zheng Zhengqiu is directing (Red Tears Shadow) after (Peach Blossom Lake). The play will naturally be wonderful, and the scenery will be the most beautiful and perfect, and will be unique. It is said that the artist Cai Chusheng has worked hard to sample and supervise the production of this film, which adopts a three-dimensional style. Cai Chusheng has carefully studied the film and planned it with the photography expert Dong Keyi, striving to beautify the light and make it a unique highlight in the oriental film industry.</p>
<p>Walking through the corridor of the set design department, we saw two sand tanks with goldfish swimming freely and chasing algae. A white rabbit was chewing grass on the steps, and a yellow oriole was tuning its tongue on the shelf, which was especially charming. We then passed the test screening room and heard laughter from inside. Wu led us in and we saw that a new film (Serving in the Army for My Wife) was being tested. The film starred Gong Jianong and Liang Saizhen. Gong played a rich man's son who knew nothing about farming and was innocent and adorable. He sacrificed for his lover, abandoned money like trash, braved arrows and stones, and spared no effort to kill the enemy. Liang Saizhen played the heroine, petite and lively, with a clear expression, depicting the emotions of a new woman and putting herself in her shoes. It is a new domestic film with a lot of laughter.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of India (47)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>The people of Khanna are very simple and honest. They walked several miles to take me to a large auditorium, which was grandly built and had many people in charge. They sat down and said that he was the secretary-general of the association, and there was also a secretary, both of whom were voluntary. There was also a reading room that could hold 200 people. Upstairs there were many stone statues and paintings of Buddha images, and many broken-armed Buddhas, especially Buddha heads. The ancient culture can be studied from the paintings. However, all the objects stored here had no English. I bitterly did not know the Indian said that my association is to preserve ancient texts and ancient objects, so I do not write English. Its intention is good, but now English is the common language of the world, so I cannot resist it. There is a stone statue that says that it is 2,000 years old. A woman has a flower basket on her head, many bracelets on her wrists, and rings on her feet, which are very rough. She has very little clothing on her body, which shows that in ancient times, the body was often nude. It is also difficult to distinguish between men and women, and only two breasts can be used to distinguish them. The breasts of ancient Indian women's statues are all very large.</p>
<p>On the 7th, I participated in a sermon. The association hung the images of various teachers in one hall. English women also attended the meeting and prayed to God for world peace. However, the conference was about human nature, which was difficult to solve. I met many Western women and Indians who all trusted in God for their hope of peace. I questioned them, saying that during the European war, all countries believed in God and prayed to God to help them kill the enemy, and also asked Eastern heretics who did not believe in God to help them kill those who believed in God. The majesty of God can also be known. In the 20th century, God is also a kind of saying. As for the problem of human nature, according to my experience, Bentham's master worked for his own benefit, which is very true. If Comte says that people work for the public, his theory is too high and not applicable. People are 80% for themselves, and the remaining 10% or 20% may be for others. This is a fair judgment.</p>
<p>On the 8th, I lectured at an Indian school with over 1,000 students. Before class, they sang a prayer song, the sound of which was Sanskrit. The head of the school was RanNarianNusra, who was about 60 years old and the secretary of the Asian Educational Association. He presided over the association. The Indian atmosphere is free to form associations, and the person in charge is the secretary. The secretary is the master. All chairpersons are honorary positions. In the afternoon, I lectured at the Training College. This school is a normal school. The two schools are connected and are both part of the university. The head of the school was LajjaShankarJha, who led me to visit his exhibition rooms. There was a kind of map that was very beautiful and useful, and it was made in England. It used pictures to show the situation in various places. For example, Shanghai was painted with various merchant ships in the port, the three northeastern provinces were painted with soybeans, and Hangzhou was painted with ancient pagodas. These paintings were colorful, very bright, and easy to give people a stimulus.</p>

<h3>Hawthorne's Detective Case, a Turn (8)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>(3) In the Police Station</p>
<p>I sat down and apologized, "Ah, Mr. Zhang, I'm really being ridiculous. After being apart for a few years, I couldn't remember for a moment. Mr. Zhang, when were you transferred to Shanghai?" Zhang Baoquan said, "Only two months. I haven't paid you a visit yet. I'm very sorry, but Mr. Bao's visit in the middle of the night is also unexpected. Is there anything I can do?" He busily took out a cigarette case and offered me a cigarette. As I took the cigarette, I glanced at the detective standing outside the door. His face had changed greatly. Not only was the fierce and rude look gone, but his eyes were fixed and his mouth was agape, as if he was afraid that some great disaster was about to befall him. I said with a smile, "Mr. Zhang, you're too polite. Tonight, I'm here as a criminal. How can you treat me like an honored guest?" Zhang Baoquan was stunned. His eyes followed my gaze and looked at the detective at the door of the office. The detective hung his hands straight down, his face gloomy, and he was biting his lips. Zhang Baoquan asked, "Qiu Kui, come in. What's going on? Did you offend this Mr. Bao?" The detective named Qiu Kui reluctantly moved his feet, crossing the doorway of the office inch by inch. He stammered, "I was ordered to secretly guard outside the Gao family's gate. About half an hour ago, I saw this gentleman coming out of the Gao family. He was walking very hurriedly, and I didn't see any of the Gao family's masters seeing him off. I didn't recognize him, so I couldn't help but be suspicious. Then, a second person quietly walked out, with the same suspicious attitude. The two of them, one after the other, were heading towards Qinghai Road, and they were both walking, not taking a car. This aroused my suspicion even more. I followed behind the second person. After I walked into Qinghai Road, I saw the second person suddenly approach this gentleman and secretly hand him something. Because of this, I concluded that there must be something mysterious going on here. At the same time, I mistakenly thought that this Mr. Bao was an accomplice of that person. At that time, I ran to this gentleman's side and took this thing from him. But I really didn't expect this gentleman to be the chief's friend. I hope the chief will forgive me." As he spoke, he handed the small package with the necklace to the chief's desk with both hands. Zhang Baoquan was stunned. He opened the white handkerchief, looked at the necklace, and then turned back to look at me. He looked up and asked, "Mr. Bao, is what he said true? What's going on?" I replied, "What he said is true, but his mind is too simple. At that time, I tried my best to explain and told him not to misunderstand. However, he insisted on not listening and stubbornly let the bandit go. To put it bluntly, it's as if he colluded with the bandit and deliberately let him go."</p>

<p>Fluctuations in Mark Prices Still Large</p>
<p>Final Drop of Two Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 8th, the price of gold marks suddenly underwent a strong change from firmness to weakness, with seven or eight taels of review for the market before and after. The overseas silver market rose very slightly, but the market did not take it seriously, so the early market opened high. Afterwards, the exchange rates for drafts and xiuli remained unchanged, and major households bought even more vigorously, causing the price to soar and break through the 740 tael mark. Unexpectedly, news suddenly spread that the UK and the US were holding a meeting to provide relief for the silver shortage, and people's hearts were immediately frightened. Sellers followed one after another, and the market turned soft, causing a sharp drop of five or six taels. In the after-market, the supply of drafts continued to worsen, and the supply on the table was greater than demand, causing sudden fluctuations. The situation continued to deteriorate, and finally the price was 731 or 2 taels, with a weak trend. This morning, large bars are used to prevent the rise.</p>
<p>The early opening saw a high disk, with the opening in June rising by 2 taels and 5 qian, totaling 736 taels and 5 qian. The reason was that the large bars only rose by one-sixteenth, and the silver price public and private telegrams have not yet been changed, and the United States is still willing to sell at a depreciated price. Afterwards, Dalian Gang and the goods hedging, etc., were sold, and the small two were suppressed for 5 taels, 6 or 7 qian. In a short time, Yuancheng, Qianchangxiang, Tongtaichang, etc. came to advance, totaling a rise of 8 taels, 2 or 3 qian. However, Yongfeng and others sold some, so the price retreated to 6 taels and 2 qian. When the first order was announced, it was 7 taels, 7 or 8 qian, and retail households bought in, but the listing was not changed. Only the Japanese gold went down a little, two or five, followed by more than one tael up and down, totaling 8 taels and 1 qian to 6 taels, 8 or 9 qian, which is almost a stable image of the internal disks. The Magic sales of June, July and August are 13375 to 4375. Since then, the East has absorbed 375 in June and the East Asia has issued 31 yuan and 125 US dollars in July. On the table, such as Yuanheng, Tongtaichang, Yuankangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, Tianfengyong, items, etc., came to advance one after another, causing the price to suddenly jump out of the 40 tael mark. After half past ten, the meter reached 42 taels and 5 qian. Suddenly, it was heard that there was a proposal to maintain the price abroad, and the British gold was also loose. Mitsui and Maihang sold 3125 to 375 in June, July and August. Chenfeng Yongyuancheng Yuanheng, etc. sold off the strips, which aroused the people's emotions, and there was a sharp drop of 5 taels. At 11 o'clock, it was 37 taels, 4 or 5 qian. In a moment, Yifeng Yong and others bought it. At half past eleven, it was 39 taels, but Yongfeng and others still had some sales. The noon receipt was 36 taels and 2 qian. The posted price was changed to 777 taels, totaling 40 taels to 35 taels. The noon receipt was still 41 taels.</p>
<p>The unstable state of the after-market. The after-market opened at 35 taels and 8 qian, followed by 5 taels, which was the aftermath after the noon drop. Continuing due to the small decline in the Indian exchange rate and telegrams, it rose to 36 taels and 2 or 3 qian. Afterwards, the sellers were lively. Dalian Gang and Tian Yuyong and others sold it, and the British gold was also loose. Mitsui first absorbed 375 to 4375, and then sold 4375, so it retreated to 34 taels. After entering, there was a mutual head of more than one or two taels. At 2:30, it began to rise, so Daxingyong Qianchangxiang Dadecheng Zhifengyong and others pursued to 3:15 for 37 taels and 7 qian. HSBC absorbed more than 4375, and then the wind and waves tightened again. HSBC Zhenggin actually bought one and a half, which was really because the Yuanheng Bingxing Yongfeng Yuanmaoyong and others sold together, and the situation was precarious. It has already fallen by six or seven taels, and it is almost impossible to recover. It was only 31 taels until 4:00, and then the banks continued to buy British gold one and a half, and the hedgers bought it. At 4:20, it was 32 taels and 8 or 9 qian. At 4:30, the market closed with only 32 taels. Continuing to raise about 3 taels, compared to the day before yesterday (according to the listing), it has fallen by 2 taels, and it has fallen for three consecutive days. According to the maximum price of 42 and a half taels throughout the day, the minimum price of 31 taels is a difference of 11 taels and 5 qian. The goods in the early market were 36 taels, the noon receipt was 5 taels and a half, the afternoon was 5 taels and a half, and the market closed at 2 taels and a half. The listing was suppressed by 44 or 5 taels, and the registration was 36 taels, and the replenishment was 34 taels. The afternoon was 30 taels.</p>
<p>The chaotic trading in the industry. The various exchanges were chaotic. Qianchangxiang, Cuichangyong, Tianfengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yu Da, Yuankangxiang, Tongtaichang, Hengxing, Yifengyong, Daxingyong, etc. all entered.

The HSBC listing only reduced the Hong Kong number by 125, totaling 78 taels and 625. The Japanese gold fell by 25, totaling 1 tael, 6 qian, 1 point, 25. There were no rises or falls. The internal British, American, and Japanese exchanges had a slight revolution, and it was seen that it was relatively high and then gradually flattened. In the afternoon, because the gold market was weak, it was also loose. However, compared to the previous night, it was not too different. Only the Japanese gold was slightly less than 25, and the situation was still peaceful. Chinese gold dealers previously requested and then supplied. The British gold was about 200,000 pounds. Banks such as Maihang, Sumitomo, and Youli had all sold. In the afternoon, Citibank, Mitsui, HSBC, Zhenggin, Sumitomo, Huabi, etc. had all absorbed it. Because the gold price was already small, the industry only stopped digging and adopted a strategy of throwing. Each bank also did a little bit for each other. The US gold was about 300,000 yuan in total transaction. However, the deposits and withdrawals were different. Banks had something to do, and the Japanese gold was sold by Dalian Gang. Dalian tickets were tens of thousands of yuan, and Huabi Zhenggin, etc. had deposited some.</p>

<p>Prices Are Firm, Rising About One Yuan Compared to Before</p>
<p>Yesterday, although various types of spot public bonds were quoted, transactions remained scarce. Futures, however, were more active than the previous day. The trend in bond prices reflected positive market sentiment, with increased investment from various parties, more enthusiastic than the previous day. Therefore, buying sentiment remained dominant in the market, and bond prices continued to rise significantly. As a result, "Disbandment and Reorganization 19" and "20 Coupon" bonds each rose by about one yuan, with smaller gains of four or five jiao for others. Spot "Disbandment and Reorganization 19 Customs" and "Large Disbandment Tickets," which had long seen no transactions, also rose sharply.

<p>The Yarn and Cotton Market Shows a Strong Trend</p>
<p>The yarn market is stable, with the overseas cotton yarn situation stable, and rumors of unrest subsiding, actual sales are considered active. Therefore, buyers have a calm attitude and are showing signs of purchasing and increasing their positions. As a result, the market sentiment has turned strong, and buying interest is strong. Retail investors are short covering, but large sellers' minds are still strong, because there is a lot of low-priced inventory of 10-count coarse yarn, and sales are lacking, so there is no intention of short covering. However, the environment is relatively good.</p>
<p>The human label tends to be high, and the opening of the human label market was good due to the slight increase in American cotton. Retail investors short covering, and raw cotton tends to rise, each rising five, six, eight, and nine cents. The afternoon opening was very strong, rising one or two cents again, and falling two or five cents in the distance. The total transaction statistics for the day were 33,600 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 1,650 bales, Taixing 1,200 bales, Gengfeng 1,950 bales, Ruidai 1,000 bales, Yiyu 1,550 bales, and Dachang 1,200 bales. Heshen bought 1,350 bales, Dafu 900 bales, Gongtai 1,900 bales, and Tianlong 1,350 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>July 1614 978750 October 1575 627650</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Activity, Current Yarn Sales Are Still Good. Statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 2,000 bales throughout the day, of which 1,250 bales were purchased by colleagues. The market is trending stronger. Among the customer gangs, 350 bales were purchased from Weihaiwei, 300 bales from Qingdao, 125 bales from Sichuan 6, 100 bales from Gaoyang, 345 bales from Hankou, 135 bales from Shantou, 160 bales from the interior, 100 bales from Xiamen, and 150 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Rises More Vigorously</h3>
<p>The trend in the cotton market is firm, with stable American cotton prices and fluctuating gold prices. Rumors in the business community say that Hankou yarn factories are purchasing raw materials in Shanghai, and large investors are buying more. Therefore, the rising trend is more intense. The cotton market itself is only stable and does not have a large upward force, but the bottom inventory is too dry, and buyers can easily raise the price.</p>
<p>Large Investors Are Buying More Han Labels. The opening of the Han Label market in the morning was very tight, and the market sentiment was very strong due to the firm American cotton prices. Retail investors short covering, and the market sentiment is also strong, each month rising four, five, or six cents. In the afternoon, some released two or three cents, with a total transaction of 96,300 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 2,600 dan, Gongtai 2,200 dan, Shenchang 2,400 dan, Yiyu 1,000 dan, and Yuanda 3,100 dan. Xincheng bought 5,000 dan, Ruidai 3,900 dan, Rongxing 2,400 dan, Changfeng 2,500 dan, and Gongtai 1,900 dan. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no current trading to be done. There is no source for current cotton trading, with an estimated 600 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Yarn Prices Vary</h3>

<p>The Sales of Grain Passengers Are Dull and Look Small</p>
<p>Yesterday, the passenger rice market was extremely sluggish. The passenger gang had no appetite, and this street also ignored it because of the booming arrival of boats from the river. According to reports, some rice merchants first packed and boarded the stack to seek a good price for the rice that arrived from the river, which was rumored to have an export passport, and because not many boats arrived, the price jumped by more than one yuan. Recently, there have been no packing transactions. Yesterday, even more boats arrived, and Sutong fell by four corners, and Changbang rice also fell by a small two or three corners. All the yuan rice was unanimously small. This street is paying attention to the river rice, and the passenger rice is not packaged at all, and the future shape also looks small.</p>
<h3>The Distant Month Powder Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the powder market in the morning, the market in each month showed a weak trend. Foreign wheat quotations fell by six or seven corners, and the weather was already very smooth. Naturally, the people's hearts have changed, and the opening prices of each month are about one cent lower than the previous day. After that, each plate was still supported due to the excessive floating, and the market stabilized slightly. Until the afternoon opening, this month still wanted to raise prices due to the excessive floating. The factories in each distant month have been silent, and the market atmosphere has recovered slightly. However, it is rumored that Japanese merchants are competing for foreign wheat, and the number is more than 100,000 tons. If the follow-up transaction is successful, I am afraid that it will inevitably change again. As a result, the current month is unchanged, June is slightly 2.5%, July and August are slightly 7.5%, September is slightly 2.5%, and October is slightly 5%.</p>
<h3>The Phase Wheat Market is Soft and Not Prosperous</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the phase wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month was generally flat and soft. Foreign wheat quotations have fallen by six or seven corners, the weather has turned hot, and the weather is clear, so the buying interest has been weak, and the general trend is to wait and see. However, because the sellers are not surging, the market can still be supported. Observing the follow-up, if the weather is smooth and foreign wheat has not moved, it may be difficult to continue to support it. As a result, the current month is smaller than the previous day by one cent, June is smaller by two cents, July is smaller by one cent, August is smaller by two cents, September is smaller by one cent, and October is smaller by two cents.</p>
<p>The sugar market is flat and the transaction is quiet.</p>
<p>The output of ice flower blue has increased by five points.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegram, the price of Cuban spot sugar continued to fall by .0625, the price of New York sugar rose by two points in May, and there was no rise or fall in December. Each month's step fell by one point. The price of Java spot sugar remained unchanged. In the public association market, the purchase of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was sluggish, and the shouting price was ten taels and five cents. The market for No. 20 medium sand white was also flat at ten taels. The transaction of white sugar was also slightly N mark ten taels six cents, YT mark ten taels five cents, SH mark ten taels one cent and a half, J mark ten taels nine cents seven and a half points, YP mark ten taels nine cents, YRO mark nine taels nine cents and a half, TX mark ten taels eight cents and a half, TM mark ten taels two cents two and a half points. The market was generally weak and lacking in spirit. The brand plate had domestic ice flower blue for sale of more than 200 bags, priced at one yuan and nine taels and three cents, which was five points higher than the original plate and the market was strong and firm.</p>
<p>North-South goods, Longkou Line powder sales are smooth and the market rises.</p>
<p>Since the opening of Longkou Line powder with 80 bags in the previous plate, the arrival has been less recent, and the sales in various places are active, and the demand is coming one after another, resulting in a shortage of supply, and the market is strong. The selling price is 22 taels and 5 cents to 23 taels. It is heard that the line party will run out of inventory by hand, and the market is still maintaining the situation, and there is a sign of continued increase.</p>
<p>Silk tea Wuyuan's new tea opening scale first sound</p>
<p>Wuse Tea Co., Ltd. has increased the mountain price year after year due to many infighting numbers, and the cost has increased accordingly. Last year, the foreign company's disk was severely shrunk and the loss was special. After the deep source of each number, the ambition is to go light. This year's mountain price is mainly reduced by 30 yuan per dan compared to the old one to lighten the cost. The mountain households who do not hesitate to sacrifice and start to pick new tea early have excellent shipments. The branches and leaves are slender and tender. The numbers are happy to see the beauty, and they are all excited in the middle. Although the silver is tight, most of them have prepared to go out of the scale to search and handle. It is heard that Wucheng Qinda Tea Co., Ltd. plans to open a scale at this village within a few days to reveal the disk price of 50 yuan per dan. Although the price is not much higher or lower than the price of the previous year, the mountain households seem not to stop at this disk for the time being.</p>
<h3>Qimen's First Red Tea Will Be Cased</h3>
<p>Since the opening of Qifu black tea, the first and second teas of each brand have been collected. Although the mountain price is higher than the old one, the numbers still hope that they will rush to open, screen, bake, and fly to Shanghai to grab the new. Qicheng, Gaotang, Shanli, Tafang, Likou and other tea brand tribute teas and the first case teas can be packed and shipped within a few days. About a week later, a large number of goods will arrive in Shanghai to spread the samples.</p>
<h3>The First Sound of the New Tea Opening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the new green tea of ​​Suian Zhenmei produced by the local Zhuang Tea Factory in this port has been seen in the market with more than 100 boxes. The aroma and leaf bottom are good, but this new tea is directly ordered from Shengji Gongsheng and other tea factories by Jinlong Xiehe, and it has a reserved nature. The new market is set at 100 taels, which is not much different from last year. At present, in order to grab the new, the foreign firm has been actively shipping it out. Observing the current market situation, the tea price in the producing area is not high, and the cost is reduced compared to the old one, so the sales may not be very sluggish. If the tea price is too high, it will be affected by the low-priced competition of Japanese tea, and it will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
<h3>Shexian Green Tea Reported to Rise</h3>
<p>Shexian Dafang Green Tea has always been reputable. This year, the tea farmers opened and picked the tea body earlier, and the tea body is more tender. However, the harvest was greatly reduced. The opening price was 80 yuan per dan. The foreign Zhuang numbers were afraid to enter, but the tea merchants gathered in the store, and the sales were doubled compared to the old ones, resulting in a shortage of supply. The tea price soared and the price was raised to more than 110 yuan, but it was still insufficient for sales.</p>
<p>Yarn Head Fine Cloth Fine Twill Re-Tends to Be High</p>
<p>Yesterday, the factory's cotton cloth market was more stable, and the fine cloth rose again. The prices of color balls, horns, Tongyang crane and other brands were about 5 points higher. The local customers were very attentive, so the holders of goods re-occupied and refused to sell, and there was a gradual upward trend. The fine twill was also strong, and the price of Yanghe rose even higher. Yesterday, it must have been 7 taels and 4 cents and a half. Because those who entered this goods have formed a group, if you need to see it hard in the future, only the coarse cloth will not be very glorious or humiliated. The current goods of nine-pound cloth are gradually increasing, and the opening price is slightly softer than before. The thirteen-pound Bianma Magou Three New Factory has resumed weaving, so there are also current goods. The Tianzi, which was once out of stock, has already arrived and opened nine taels. Wanyanqing's cut-off coarse twill medium three fish three rabbit slightly fell five yuan, and Baoer was still strong.</p>
<p>The overall situation of the East and West yarn head market is stable, but the sales have become clearer and clearer. In fact, it is the off-season, and the local fields are busy with the second customer gang purchases are also small, so the shipments on this street have gradually decreased. Yesterday, only the Yangtze River gang was still interested, and they returned to Moganshan Zhigongni for 50 pieces, priced at three yuan and five and a half cents. The rest of the intentions were quiet. The source of fine piqué's lower body goods was quite abundant, so the deflation was quite strong yesterday. Gongsun map only sold 2 taels and 9 cents, Jing'an Temple 2 taels and 8 cents and a half, and Heletu 2 taels 9 cents and 7 mils, which was 5 mils lower than before. Baoqiu was still out of stock. The fine cloth rose, the fourteen-pound Yuanyan sold 9 taels 8 cents and a half, and the twelve-pound Shiley Bird 9 taels 1 cent. The bleached cloth was slightly transacted in this street, the flower and bird was 8 taels 7 cents and a half, the Santan 10 taels 3 cents and a half, and the Fushou Samsung 11 taels 2 cents and a half.</p>
<p>Hardware Black Iron Sheet New Goods Have Arrived</p>
<p>The market for 18-piece black iron sheets is extremely scarce, causing all gangs to purchase very enthusiastically. It was found that Xintaiku Wharf loaded more than 1,000 bundles of new goods yesterday, so there is no panic in the market for a while. The market price is 11 taels and 7 cents and a half per dan. It is heard that more than 200 bundles have been sold to Tianjin gangs.</p>
<h3>British Association Iron Sales Are Smooth</h3>
<p>The price of 200-pound American Association iron has risen sharply to 36 taels due to the small inventory and strong buyers. However, those who wanted to purchase it later had to rely on British Association iron because there were no goods to purchase. It is heard that the purchase households also handled 400 or 500 boxes yesterday, and the price was 32 taels and 5 cents. The export gangs, such as Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao, also wanted to collect them, so the market trend was very optimistic. It is heard that many brokers want to take the opportunity to hoard, and the market outlook is becoming more and more consolidated.</p>
<p>Oil Market Asphalt Market Soars</p>
<p>There is no standard for adding standards every day.</p>
<p>The asphalt surge continued. In the past three or four days, it has seen a miraculous peak outside the sky. The Canglong suddenly rose. Since the previous two days, Han Dian opened a heavy Jing 24 taels 2 cents and sesame oil 22 taels 4 cents. Then, the stacked telegrams from the previous two days flew in. The heavy Jing oil rose from 25 taels to 26 taels, and the Macheng oil also rose from 23 taels to 24 taels and 25 taels. Only a day apart, the flight rose by two or three taels. It is a new era that has never been seen since the market opened. It is heard that the reason is that the source is gradually arriving and gradually decreasing. The Han market has exhausted its bottom. Although the sales are not very strong, the demand is always greater than the supply. Buyers grab it regardless of the price when the goods arrive. It is estimated that as soon as you look back, you have been preempted by others, so the goods have already been pre-determined on the way, and there are no more, and the quality of the goods does not matter. In the past, there have always been rising markets, but they have never been as sudden as this time. Therefore, even those who are old in this industry are speechless. Since the Han market is as described above, the oils produced in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces are not as rich as those in Hubei Province, but in the past, they were enough to save the lack of market. There are no goods. It is only heard that a Hebang guest sold 20 or 30 pieces of Heben car oil yesterday, which is estimated to be 37 yuan per dan delivered to the Shen Station. It is heard that there will be no less than 38 yuan for another transaction. The storekeepers in this port have no inventory and the selling prices are completely chaotic and there is no fixed standard. Both buyers and sellers have fallen into the five-mile fog.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables the National Government</h3>
<p>For Review of Export Tariffs</p>
<p>Export Tax on Manufactured Goods Should Be Reduced or Eliminated</p>
<p>In Order to Maintain Overseas Sales</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, considering that the new export tariff regulations have been officially announced but are related to international trade, telegraphed the National Government yesterday, requesting a review to avoid hindering export trade. The original telegram stated: "To the National Government of Nanjing: According to reports, the revised customs export tariff regulations have been amended and approved by the Legislative Yuan based on the original proposal submitted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to your government for official announcement. As this matter concerns international trade, it has a significant impact, and we would like to offer our humble opinion for consideration. The main reason for this revision is that the old tariff regulations of Xianfeng Wuwu have been in place for decades, and the changes in the price of specific duties are significant. The so-called '5% tax on 100' is no longer true. Furthermore, the abolition of the regular customs within fifty li also needs to be compensated, so the export tax is appropriately revised to provide funding. According to commercial policy, export of manufactured goods should be exempt from tax or subject to a very low tax rate, while the export tax on raw materials that our country must maintain may be appropriately increased. The association has made proposals during business conferences, outlining the main points. We have found that the export of manufactured goods, such as summer cloth sold to Korea and machine-made egg yolk sold to the United States, has declined sharply in recent years due to high import taxes in those countries. Furthermore, hand-woven native cloth sold to Hong Kong and firecrackers sold to France and the United States are all handmade, related to the livelihood of civilians, or are sideline industries of farmers. All should be exempt from customs duties or have export customs duties reduced, such as the current proportion of export tax on soybeans in Dong Province, in order to maintain overseas sales. We respectfully request your government to review the tariff regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan. If the tax rate on the above-mentioned goods is higher than the current tariff regulations, we request that the Legislative Yuan reconsider and reduce them before announcing them to avoid hindering export trade. This is for the public good. Sincerely, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Coal Industry</h3>
<p>Please Reduce National Coal Transportation Costs</p>
<p>Otherwise, It Will Create an Opportunity for Foreign Coal to Sell Well</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association presented to the Ministry of Railways: "We respectfully submit this report to request the exemption of national coal transportation costs to encourage miners and promote sales. It has been found that the largest domestic coal-producing areas are Boshan, Zichuan, Zhongxing, Jingxing, Zhengfeng, Datong, Liuhegou, Mentougou, and the major mines in Shanxi. In order to encourage export trade, the government has set extremely low export freight rates for the Jiaoji Railway. Last year, there was a temporary suspension of this measure. After a request, it was approved on November 11th, with Industry Order No. 591, stating that the railway freight rates were restored on November 1st. Now, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau has received an order from Your Ministry, instructing that freight rates be increased by 20% across the board from May 1st. If this is implemented, the cost of coal will increase sharply, making it impossible to compete with foreign coal. This is not a good policy for encouraging miners. In January of this year, Your Ministry convened a freight conference, and miners from Shandong Province submitted a report proposing to reduce freight rates, arguing that export freight is different from ordinary freight. This was discussed at the meeting. According to newspaper reports, the Beining, Ping-Sui, Ping-Han, Jinpu, and Longhai railway bureaus are considering simultaneously increasing freight rates by 20%. Coal merchants are extremely panicked upon hearing this news. At a time when foreign coal is experiencing slightly difficult sales due to gold prices and the Kailuan coal refusal to transport, it is a good opportunity to promote national coal. At this time, if the government actively encourages miners to develop resources, it can not only resist foreign coal but also enrich the people's livelihood. It is a moment of good fortune that still causes those who purchase domestic coal to hesitate, which is deeply regrettable. It allows domestic manufacturers and users to purchase foreign coal without reducing it slightly. Your Ministry's various locomotives also use cheap and high-quality coal as the standard. If the cost of national coal is expensive, it will be difficult to win bids for various railways. The result is that it creates an opportunity for foreign coal to sell well. This seems to contradict the government's main purpose of developing national coal and encouraging export of national coal. Your Ministry has the power to weigh the interests and is clear about the advantages and disadvantages. If you can reduce the freight rates, the volume of transportation will increase, and the income will be abundant. This will gradually improve the competitiveness of the backward national coal. The desire to industrialize must rely on the supply of national coal. If we abandon our own coal and use foreign coal, when will the economic leakage be plugged? When will the Premier's industrial plan be seen? This is the coal merchants' urgent desire to speak out on the advantages and disadvantages and beg Your Ministry to give it special consideration. We respectfully submit our humble opinions and respectfully request Your Ministry to grant an order instructing all railway bureaus across the country to exempt purely national coal freight rates from being increased, so as to encourage and open up resources. We are anxiously awaiting your orders. Sincerely, Sun, Minister of Railways."</p>
<h3>Today's May Ninth Commemoration</h3>
<p>Various Sectors Hold Commemorative Meeting at the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, the European War broke out, and the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Russia, and other countries were all caught in the vortex of mutual attacks. Taking advantage of the fact that the European and American powers had no time to attend to the East, Japanese imperialism, under the pretext of declaring war on Germany, seized our Qingdao and occupied the Jiaoji Railway. It also presented the Twenty-One Demands, which aimed to destroy our country and exterminate our race, to the then-Beijing puppet government of Yuan Shikai on May 9th of the fourth year of the Republic of China. Under the threat of military force, Yuan Shikai signed and acknowledged them. This was unanimously opposed by the entire country, and the treaty was of course invalid. However, it can be seen from this that Japanese imperialism is the most sinister and ruthless of international imperialists. On the occasion of the sixteenth anniversary, the old illness of the Twenty-One Demands has recurred, and the new hatred of the May Third Jinan Massacre has not yet been avenged. How should our four hundred million people endure hardship and humiliation to avenge this great disgrace? The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Committee, in view of this, has specifically decided to hold a commemorative meeting at 9:00 a.m. today in the auditorium on the third floor of the Party Headquarters on Linyin Road in the Nanshi district. At that time, all organs, groups, and levels of Party branches in this city should send four representatives to participate. The entire city will also fly flags at half-mast and suspend banquets and entertainment for one day to express mourning. The Citizens Training Association will also issue a public announcement. Rural areas farther from the city will also have their respective district Party branches convene local people to hold commemorative ceremonies. The conference order, slogans, and news from the various district Party branches determined by the Municipal Propaganda Department are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Conference Order: (1) All stand at attention. (2) Sing the Party Song. (3) Pay the highest respect to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of the Premier. (4) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will. (5) Silent tribute. (6) Chairman's report. (7) Speeches. (8) Shout slogans. (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Conference Slogans: (1) Do not forget the national humiliation of May Ninth. (2) Abolish consular jurisdiction. (3) Recover all concessions in the country. (4) Abolish all unequal treaties. (5) Defeat Japanese imperialism. (6) Continue to boycott foreign goods. (7) Support the National Assembly. (8) Strive for revolutionary construction. (9) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party. (10) Long live the Republic of China.</p>

The three elders have already arrived in Shanghai, and Mr. Wang is taking advantage of this time to recuperate and has decided to travel to Europe.</p>
<p>Requesting Leave to Go to Europe. President Wang was elected as a judge of the International Court of Justice in Geneva. He plans to go to Europe to take office.

Yesterday, all the procedures have been completed, and he is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 12th of this month. The luggage and other items have also been finalized.</p>
<p>Date of Departure: Mr. Wang originally planned to take the Russian Empress of the Changxing Company on the 11th, transfer from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean to Europe.

<h3>Two National Goods Organizations</h3>
<p>Telegraph Request to Revise Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the revision of the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty. The original telegram is as follows: "Respectfully, since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, Japan has increased the import duty on Chinese silk to 100% of its value, and for eight years now, not only has Chinese silk been completely eliminated in Japan and Korea, but Japanese silk has taken the opportunity to be imported into Korea, causing Koreans to almost mistakenly believe that the currently sold Japanese silk is Chinese silk. Young people are completely unaware of what Chinese silk is. If Chinese silk cannot be sold to Korea from now on, then the long history of Chinese silk in Korea will inevitably be cut off. Is this only related to our country's economy and people's livelihood? Now, thanks to the efforts of our National Government and your leadership, we have heard that we have renegotiated a tariff treaty with Japan, stipulating that the import of Chinese silk is 70% of its value, which is 30% less than before, but it is still 162% higher than the 8% duty on Japanese silk exported to Korea. Therefore, it is actually difficult for Chinese silk to be exported to Korea. This association believes that the current treaty with Japan has a term of three years. It should be revised when the term expires. Within the term of this treaty, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should convene relevant groups to conduct detailed research on the points that should be revised and prepare calmly so that it can be revised and renegotiated based on the revision when the term expires, so as to avoid repeating the same mistakes and revitalize the national silk industry. We are specially telegraphing to your leadership for your examination and approval and hope that you will adopt and implement it. We await your orders eagerly. The China National Goods Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation, respectfully. Yang."</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun on the</h3>
<p>Reorganization of the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Remarks Deviate Significantly from the Facts</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the Shanghai Municipal Government, all newspapers published reports yesterday. Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun told reporters from various newspapers yesterday that the reorganization news reported in the newspapers deviated significantly from the facts and was not true. According to Mr. Yu, the motive for the reorganization of the Municipal Government is not limited to Shanghai alone, but stems from the proposal of the Third Plenary Session to practice strict economy, with the intention of reducing the budget and laying off redundant personnel. This city previously received a circular from the Executive Yuan forwarding the latest Municipal Organization Law promulgated by the National Government, ordering reorganization. The Municipal Government drafted the Rules of Organization of this Municipal Government and submitted them for review. The Executive Yuan recently approved them and should be reorganized in accordance with them. This is the reason for the reorganization. Some newspapers reported that the Secretary's expenses last year reached 250,000, or that the Secretary's Office expenses exceeded 250,000. These are not facts. The Secretary's Office is one of the organs under the Municipal Government. Excluding the bureaus, the expenses of the Municipal Government itself are the expenses of the Secretary's Office. The Secretary's Office does not have an independent expense of more than 200,000 per year.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for the Construction of</h3>
<p>Memorial Tower for the Fallen Soldiers of the Fifth Division</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Telegraphed the Ministry of the Interior Yesterday</p>
<p>The Location is Set at the Corner of Longhua Road</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, recently specially dispatched Jiang Yi, Chief of the Adjutant Office of the Garrison Headquarters, to the Municipal Government yesterday morning to meet with Secretary-General Yu Hongjun to discuss the construction of a memorial tower for the fallen soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army's Fifth Division. As a result, the Municipal Government telegraphed the Ministry of the Interior to designate a location for construction. According to Mr. Jiang, the location of the memorial tower is currently set at the corner of Jinyi Road and Longhua Road, covering an area of approximately five mu. The design is purely Chinese style. The estimated cost of purchasing the land is 5,000 yuan, and the construction cost is 15,000 yuan, which will be fully paid from the public accumulation fund of the Fifth Division. The project is expected to be completed in about three months.</p>

<p>A French policeman, No. 158, from the French Concession Police Station shot and wounded Xin Haishan, an employee of Changhe Company, on Yong'an Street. Various groups held meetings to provide assistance and sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Government and Du Yuesheng, a director of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, to negotiate with the French authorities. For a time, there was no satisfactory reply. It is now learned that Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Geng, a secretary of the Municipal Government, negotiated with the French Consul General, M. Gaillard, on this case yesterday. It is reported that Mr. Gaillard made a concrete statement yesterday and agreed on a corresponding method to satisfy the other party.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Telegraphically Engaged</h3>
<p>Water Supply Expert Schell to Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>Researching the Issue of Reducing Water Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks Company increased the water price by 25% last year. At that time, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association protested. Later, the Waterworks Increased Price Issue was approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council. It was difficult to cancel the completed resolution. It was decided to adopt a compromise approach to recognize the increase in water prices as an established fact. On the one hand, the Shanghai Municipal Council hired foreign water supply experts to come to Shanghai for research. At the latest, the results of the research will be published by the end of this year, and then it will be decided whether the increase in water prices is necessary. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors passed a resolution at the regular meeting the night before to immediately hire water supply experts to come to Shanghai, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council telegraphed New York yesterday morning to hire the famous water supply expert Mr. Schell to come to Shanghai. All expenses are set at 50,000 taels. The Shanghai Municipal Council had previously informally sought Mr. Schell's opinion. At that time, Mr. Schell was unwilling to leave his affairs in the United States prematurely and did not fully agree, but he agreed to find someone else to come. The Shanghai Municipal Council did not approve, so it officially telegraphed Mr. Schell himself yesterday morning based on the resolution of the Board of Directors, and it is expected to succeed. Mr. Schell is a famous water supply expert in the United States with rich experience. He has served as a water supply engineer in about 200 places in the United States, Canada, Cuba, and other countries, and is the President of the American Water Works Association.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Declaration on Property Rent Assessment</p>
<p>Stating That a Few Cases</p>
<p>Were Estimated Based on Reason</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Declaration on Property Rent Assessment is translated as follows: "Recently, there have been misunderstandings in the outside world regarding the Council's property rent assessment for the collection of property tax, as reported in the newspapers. Therefore, the Council would like to inform taxpayers that the property rent assessment standards adopted by the Council are the same as those adopted for sixty years. The Council has not only not adopted any changes, but also has not considered any changes. The Land Regulations stipulate that the Council may estimate the value of the land and the rent of the buildings as a tax standard and may collect this property tax and land tax. To ensure that residents of all levels bear the tax burden equally, the Land Regulations also stipulate that a land tax shall not exceed one two-thousandth of the land value, and the property tax shall not exceed one percent of the annual rent. Property valuation is carried out regularly, and the rental and residential conditions of buildings vary, so the property rent assessment must be considered one by one. The Council often implements this principle according to a principle, which is the rent. However, it represents the taxable value of the property.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The so-called rent does not accurately represent this value. Since 1867, this argument has been reviewed by different courts at different times and has been thoroughly judged as follows (debate on the pros and cons): After careful consideration, the court is thoroughly convinced that regardless of the actual value of the buildings owned by the defendants, the Council has the power to assess these buildings for the purpose of taxation. The actual rent paid clearly represents the value that can be rented, which is largely recognized by the Council. There are exceptions that are not recognized, but they are few in number. However, although rent is sufficient as a standard for property valuation, the method of managing the buildings is countless, and the relationship between the owner and the tenant is also very different, not only based on the amount of rent paid. Those who are familiar with the situation should be able to see this. The difficulties in assessing property tax are briefly listed as follows: (1) Most owners are residents. (2) Nominal rents are often charged due to kinship or friendship, which is less than the value that can be rented. It is unreasonable to use this reduction or nominal rent as a standard for micro-taxation. (3) Owners and tenants often negotiate to change the principle of determining the taxable value of all buildings. When the owner receives a large sum of money from the tenant when he enters the house, the rent paid weekly, monthly, or annually thereafter may obviously be a standard for micro-taxation, which is less than the rent that can actually be collected. When the owner rents out his building, he can stipulate a condition that the tenant must bear the main repair costs and other expenses in addition to paying the rent, which is usually borne by the owner. Regarding the tenant's self-equipment or easements, the owner can also obtain other benefits, thereby increasing the rental value. Unfortunately, there are also several cases of deliberate negotiation to forge rent receipts, which is a criminal matter. Taxes should be borne equally by all residents as much as possible. This is one of the main principles that any government and any system should abide by. In other words, taxes should be equal, so it cannot be allowed for owners and tenants to negotiate or concede specifically to reduce the standard of micro-taxation, thereby making the burden of general taxpayers unfairly increased. This is undoubtedly true. Although the property tax paid by most taxpayers in the Public Concession is based on the annual rent paid, it should also be checked to ensure that the tax paid is appropriate and does not receive special treatment, making the remaining residents bear a heavier burden. Since January of this year, a few property tax cases have been reviewed because the Council believes that the rent paid is lower than the price at which the houses can be expected to be rented under normal circumstances. The Council has estimated the rent based on the value that is reasonable and appropriate for these cases and has stipulated that if the taxpayer is dissatisfied, he may appeal to the Rent Assessment Appeal Committee within 30 days. The Committee has nothing to do with the principle on which the assessed value is based. Its task is to consider whether the rent amount estimated for the standard for collecting property tax is appropriate. The Council's method has been consistent since the Council's history. This method is in line with the principles and habits adopted by various countries and has been recognized as appropriate by the courts within the Public Concession. Unless there are special circumstances, the actual rent paid is considered to clearly represent the taxable value of the property. Taxpayers also have a guarantee that they can appeal, and the appeal process is also publicized.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Bureau of Health</h3>
<p>Recruiting Chinese Trainees</p>
<p>Selecting Eight Candidates</p>
<p>The Chinese trainees recruited by the Bureau of Health have now been selected after detailed consideration by the committee. Xia Lian Tang, Zheng Xiyuan, Cao Changling, Cao Zhiming, Luo Jiwen, Lu Bingjun, Huang Jiaao, and Lin Jianhong have been selected as probationary trainees. The probationary period starts on May 18th of this year. The certificates and other items submitted by the remaining unselected students can be collected from the Bureau of Health office at No. 130A Hankou Road.</p>
<h3>Fair Tax Report Volume Two</h3>
<p>To be Published in Early June</p>
<p>The first volume of the Fair Tax Report has been published. The second volume was originally scheduled to be published about three weeks after the publication of the first volume. Now, because the time is too tight and because the South African government has approved an extension of his stay in Shanghai for several weeks, it is planned to work calmly and publish the second volume of the report in early June.</p>
<h3>Wu Jingqing</h3>
<p>Requesting Exemption from the Collection of Land Survey Expenses</p>
<p>And Requesting Swift Action to the Municipal Land Bureau</p>
<p>To Strive for the Return of Previously Collected Funds</p>
<p>Wu Jingqing, the head of the first district of Shanghai County, submitted a reason at the district head meeting for the Shanghai County Government to collect land survey expenses again under the item of farmland, requesting exemption. The original text is as follows: "To propose a request for exemption from the collection of land survey expenses and to request swift action to the Municipal Land Bureau to strive for the return of previously collected funds to continue to carry out the land survey project. (Explanation) It has been found that the land survey expenses of this county were collected in the past five or six years, and the amount collected in the past four or five years was quite large. At the same time, a bureau was established to start surveying, and remarkable results were achieved. Later, the work was suspended due to being taken over by the Municipal Government Land Bureau. After the division of the municipality and the county, the provincial and municipal governments agreed that the land survey matters in the county-owned districts would still be handled by the Land Bureau. However, the Land Bureau has made unremitting progress in the land survey of the urban area, while it has turned a blind eye to the county-owned districts. It has been found that the funds for the land survey of the county-owned districts are deposited in the municipal bureau, amounting to more than 79,000 yuan, which is more than enough to carry out the land survey project in this county. The second administrative meeting of this county resolved to present to the province to transfer to the municipal government to order the Land Bureau to respect the provincial and municipal agreements to complete the land survey of each district and to send a letter to the former General Director of the Land Survey Bureau to open a list of income and expenditure accounts for review. However, the municipal government has not shown any sincerity so far, and at the same time, it is reported that your government has news of recollecting rural cleansing expenses. Considering that the public has already borne the rural cleansing expenses, how can they bear the burden of recollecting them? The Municipal Bureau has already received the land survey expenses and should respect the agreement to complete the land survey of this county. How can it continue to delay and put the local autonomy of this county into a standstill? It should be requested that the county magistrate have compassion for the people's difficulties and approve the exemption from the collection of land survey expenses, and at the same time, strive with reason to the municipal bureau to order the return of the stored funds in full so as to complete the land survey work. Is it appropriate? Please make a public decision."</p>
<h3>Order Approved to Collect County Farm Expenses</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai County Farm, the expenses have been quite stretched, making it difficult to carry out the work. Niu Wang Meixian, the director of the farm, has repeatedly requested the county government to find a way to raise funds. The county government reported the situation to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to request that 4% of the farm expenses be collected under the Mang item. After receiving the report, the department checked and verified that the land tax collection in Shanghai County had not exceeded 101%, and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. The county government has been instructed to approve the collection of funds. Therefore, County Magistrate Yan ordered the County Finance Bureau yesterday to comply with the order.</p>
<h3>Shangbao</h3>
<p>Stamp Tax Bureau Concurrently Investigates Liquor</p>
<p>The Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau recently received an order from the Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to concurrently handle the inspection of Shangbao liquor. Bureau Chief Mr. Song Jiju has been preparing for this for the past few days. It is reported that the bureau will soon begin operations. Yesterday, the following public notice was issued: Public Notice No. 1 of the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau and the Shangbao Liquor Inspection Office, stating the reason for the notice: According to Order No. 242 of the Jiangsu Stamp, Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, which was based on Directive No. 40912 of the Ministry of Finance, this Bureau submitted a report concerning the handling of the Shanghai Liquor Inspection Office and a review of whether it should continue to operate. The report stated that when the Shanghai Liquor Inspection Office was previously handled by the Second District Branch Bureau, unscrupulous merchants were still somewhat apprehensive and did not dare to openly attempt illegal activities, so it was not without effect. Now that the price of alcohol has increased, although using it for illicit production may decrease due to cost considerations, there is concern that once the inspection office is cancelled, malpractices will re-emerge. Since the Second District Branch Bureau has been abolished, all affairs of the inspection office should be handled by the Bureau, which should assess the situation and order nearby branch bureaus to temporarily continue to handle the affairs to ensure proper management. You are to comply with this order and report the compliance for review. This order, etc. Upon receiving this order, we investigated that the originally established Liquor Inspection Office in Shanghai was approved by the former Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau to be concurrently handled by the former Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Branch Bureau. Later, the Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Branch Bureau was ordered to be abolished, and the inspection office was also abolished at the same time. In January of this year, we received an order from the Ministry, based on the Shanghai Liang Shao Liquor Trade Association's request, submitted by Huang Yuming, to abolish the Foreign Liquor Tax Bureau, merge it into Customs, and increase import tax rates to prevent the use of illicit liquor, etc. We were instructed to thoroughly investigate the effectiveness of the previous Liquor Inspection Office and submit a report. Accordingly, we instructed Inspector Huang to investigate the situation and review whether to continue operations, and submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance for review. Now that we have received the previous order, we should comply with it. Considering that the branch bureau's address was originally located in Shanghai, the affairs of this Liquor Inspection Office can be concurrently handled by the branch bureau nearby, without incurring additional expenses to save costs. In addition to informing various liquor tax bureaus, we are issuing copies of the previous Liquor Inspection Office's regulations, regulations on cracking down on illicit liquor, and the original report submitted by this Bureau to the Ministry. The branch bureau chief is to comply with the order and report the date of commencement of operations for review and transfer. Furthermore, the branch bureau chief should review the aforementioned regulations and promptly submit separate proposals for any obstacles and necessary amendments to be reviewed, so as to achieve perfection and facilitate implementation. This order, etc. Copies were sent to the Bureau. Upon receiving this, the Bureau Chief took office in a concurrent capacity on April 17. In addition to submitting reports and issuing orders, we are issuing this public notice to inform all liquor merchants. It is imperative to understand that adulterating liquor with water, reselling it, and privately transporting liquor and alcohol with the intention of illicit production not only harms hygiene but also encroaches on domestic production. The ban is strict, and investigations have been conducted. At the beginning of my tenure, for the sake of commercial ethics, I must offer sincere advice. I sincerely hope that all liquor merchants will cherish themselves, strive for improvement, and avoid repeating past mistakes. If anyone fails to exercise self-restraint and is found to be adulterating liquor or privately transporting liquor and alcohol with the intention of reselling, once investigated by this Bureau or reported by others, the law is in place, and I, the Bureau Chief, will have no choice but to punish them according to the law and cannot grant leniency. You must all comply with this and not violate it. This notice is issued on May 6, the twentieth year of the Republic of China. Bureau Chief Song Jiju</p>
<h3>Shanghai Labor Circle</h3>
<p>Demanding the Establishment of a Supreme Authority</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in order to demand the organization of a supreme authority for workers, yesterday sent a telegram to Mr. Hou Dachun, a representative to the National Assembly, requesting a proposal at the National Assembly to seek equality for workers' status based on the Three Principles of the People. The original telegram is transcribed below: To Comrade Hou Dachun, Representative to the Nanjing National Assembly: Agriculture, industry, commerce, and education are said to be the foundation of the Republic of China. How can equality of status be overlooked? Today, agriculture, commerce, and education all have provincial and municipal associations for agriculture, commerce, and education, respectively, to manage their affairs, leaving only workers without a supreme authority to guide them. If the excuse is that there are different types of work, it should be known that the types of work are divided according to commerce, and the division of labor in commerce is even greater than in work. The unfairness of work is even more serious than this. The reason why the world is in turmoil is that workers feel unfairly treated. The Premier advocated supporting agriculture and industry, as seen in various writings in the political program of the Principle of People's Rights, where sages, talents, mediocrities, and fools are all equal. How can a government that embraces the Three Principles of the People tolerate one of the four classes of citizens of the country under the blue and white flag suffering from unequal status? The four classes of citizens are like the four limbs of a person. A disabled limb cannot make a healthy person. Like the four legs of a table, a shorter leg cannot make a perfect table. The tendency to tilt is immediately apparent in the country. The psychology of the masses is like the tide of a river. If guided smoothly, it can enrich fertile land, produce hundreds of grains, benefit the country, and benefit the people. If obstructed against the current, it will inevitably become a flood. As the saying goes, things must rot before worms grow. Workers harboring a sense of unfairness are exploited by the red bandits, who use their opportunity to stir up their energy to remove their weaknesses without medicine, let alone warfare. This is called attacking the heart first, followed by attacking the city. The ancients said that no one has ever become king by loving to kill people. Those who subdue people with virtue become kings, and those who subdue people with force become hegemons. The balance of politics lies in achieving fairness, and the revolution lies in reforming the heart, reforming the unfairness of the heart, and making it fair. This is the true revolution. In the era of the twentieth century, it is difficult to escape the old ways of mercantilism and to desire the coordination of industry and commerce. Even if it is not necessary to reverse it, it must be made fair first. Comrades, work hard for the Party and the country. The associations have witnessed the torrent and discerned the hidden dangers. We dare to present to you the expectations of all Shanghai workers. What the national workers want to express is that the comrades must propose to the General Assembly to seek equality for workers' status based on the Three Principles of the People. Then, guiding the key points will naturally lead to a responsible group that will stop the red bandits, which is better than eradicating them. It will surely be easier and more effective. This telegram is urgent and implores you to do so.

<h3>Resolution of Labor Dispute in Western Restaurant Industry</h3>
<p>The workers in the Western restaurant industry in this city organized a union, and the capitalists of Jinlong, Central, and Hensen dismissed five members of the preparatory committee, including Gu Youqing, Lai Shengquan, Zhou Yonghe, Wu Shenxiang, and Jiang Asan. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs mediated unsuccessfully. Now the Western Restaurant Industry Union has been formally established. The court has ruled on Gu Youqing's case of forging documents. Du Yuesheng also mediated the labor dispute a few days ago, resolving the reinstatement of the dismissed workers. Both labor and management have embraced a spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding.</p>
<h3>General Assembly of Silk Factory Trade Representatives</h3>
<p>Wages to Be Based on Wuxi Standards</p>
<p>Hope for the Speedy Issuance of Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association held its eighth extraordinary general assembly of representatives at 4 PM yesterday (the 8th). Attendees included Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, Huang Jinfan, and more than 100 manufacturers. Shen Huachen presided over the meeting. Following the ceremony, Chairman Shen first reported that (1) the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter requesting donations for the temporary relief of the Shaanxi disaster. The industry has donated a total of 705 yuan, which has been sent to the disaster relief association, and an official receipt has been obtained for preservation. The association will issue a separate announcement to thank them. (2) The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was ordered to announce the promotion of domestic machinery. (3) The Ministry of Railways approved the request to reduce freight charges for both routes for the transport of cocoons and to be responsible for their safekeeping. (4) Introduction to the Textile Weekly. (5) A letter was sent to the Shanghai Foreign Merchant Insurance Association requesting that, in the future, if an accident occurs, the appraiser requested by the insurance company should seek the consent of the insured; otherwise, it would be difficult to recognize it. While reporting, a reply was received from the Insurance Association, stating that this matter concerns the business of each insurance company, and the association is not in a position to interfere. They expressed their deep regret. After the report, two important cases were discussed: (1) The letter from the Yinxiang District and other two silk reeling unions requested that the original wages be restored from May 1. The consensus was that the labor-management agreement signed by the representatives of both labor and management at the Bureau of Social Affairs last year stipulated that the wages of female workers would be calculated at 85% of the original wages, and the validity period was from the date of the agreement to the end of May this year, which is still more than 20 days away. Recently, the foreign silk market has been so sluggish that it would be difficult to restore the original wages ahead of schedule. After a lengthy discussion by the representatives present, Standing Committee Member Zhu Jing'an stood up and reported that in Wuxi, the wages of female workers were also reduced from 60 cents to 53 cents last year, following the Shanghai method. This year, it has been renegotiated to 57 cents per worker. The number of wage increases per month has been changed from four to three, and holidays will be determined separately. The chairman immediately submitted the Wuxi proposal to the public for voting. The public initially approved the payment of 57 cents per worker, and the four wage increases were changed to three. The public decision was to reply to the two silk reeling unions based on the situation, and the implementation will be scheduled after receiving their consent. (2) Regarding the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bond case, the chairman reported that after the official announcement by the Executive Yuan, the special committee held a meeting to appoint Shen Huachen, Chu Fucheng, and Qian Fenghao as members of the public bond allocation committee, and Wang Xiaolai and Wu Shenbo as members of the fund custody committee. It was decided to report to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance to request the early appointment of the committee to proceed together. Reliable sources have reported that the Ministry of Industry has appointed Mu Ouchu and Zou Bingwen as members of the allocation committee, and Song Ziliang and Mr. Liu (President of the National Goods Bank) as members of the fund custody committee. However, the Audit Yuan and the Ministry of Finance have not yet appointed anyone. The public believes that the new cocoons in the mainland will soon be on the market, and the industry needs funds to purchase cocoons. It would be best if the chairman could go to Beijing to personally request the Ministry of Finance and the Audit Yuan to immediately appoint someone to come to Shanghai to allocate and issue the bonds to solve the urgent need. The meeting adjourned at 7 PM.</p>
<h3>Papal Commendation of the Anti-Drug Association</h3>
<p>Instructing National Churches to Participate in Anti-Drug Efforts</p>
<p>Hoping Inland Authorities Eliminate Opium Seedlings</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, recognizing the Catholic Church's consistent sympathy for the anti-drug movement, was supported by Archbishop Gangzuo, the delegate of the Holy See, who sent a letter expressing his support when the association was founded. Ma Xiangbo, an important Catholic figure, joined the founders, and the Catholic Action Association joined in cooperation. Recently, due to the severity of the opium problem, it was deemed necessary to unite all parties in a concerted effort. At the end of last year, the association entrusted Lu Zhengxiang, the former Prime Minister of Belgium, who is currently serving in the Belgian Catholic Church, to request the Pope to instruct the Catholic churches in China to join the anti-drug movement. A letter of encouragement from the Pope, sent by Prime Minister Lu, has been received. The translated text is as follows: His Holiness the Pope has instructed that he has received the letter and carefully reviewed it, expressing concern for church affairs and the nation's interests. He also mentioned the efforts of your country's Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and requested that the Pope instruct the Christian churches in China to participate in the anti-drug movement. The Pope deeply appreciates the efforts of the Chinese people to reject opium and narcotic drugs. These drugs are a great harm to both body and soul, and it is not easy to eradicate them. The Pope also prays that the Holy Lord will bless these movements and bring them to fruition. The leaders of this church have been deeply studying the opium problem since 1886. During the First Chinese Catholic Congress in 1924, priests from various regions decided to include the eradication of the opium scourge in the resolutions. This intention should be restated and announced in Instruction No. 31. The church's archives show that church missionaries engaged in the work of saving souls were the initiators of the anti-drug movement. The leaders of local churches are hereby instructed to redouble their efforts and revive the movement. If necessary, they should form anti-drug organizations and develop the most effective methods to declare war on this bad habit. Bishops and district leaders are especially urged to strictly implement the church's rules. The Pope has specially instructed the Archbishop of China to incorporate methods of preventing opium and its derivatives into the curriculum of church schools. The Pope is deeply satisfied with the Chinese government's efforts to ban opium. However, if inland authorities do not follow the government's orders and prohibit the cultivation of opium seedlings, the anti-drug movement will be difficult to achieve. The Pope fervently hopes that the civil war in China will be pacified, order will be restored, and laws will be clarified so that the government's policy of prohibiting opium cultivation can be implemented. In this way, with the united strength of the church and the cooperation of the general public in the anti-drug effort, satisfactory results can be achieved. The Pope, to express his special favor, extends his blessing.</p>

The captain, Tao Axiao, was shot, and the bandits boarded the boat and looted everything. At the same time, the Chunshen steamboat of the Laogongmao Steamboat Bureau, which operates the Shanghai-Wuxi route, also passed through the area and suffered the same robbery, resulting in heavy losses. We are deeply alarmed by this news. Thinking about the past years, bandits have been rampant, killing and robbing are common. Now, they are even robbing steamboats, endangering travelers. If they are not quickly arrested, both public security and commercial transportation will be harmed. Therefore, we are sending this telegram to request that you immediately issue a general order to the military and police authorities of Kunshan and Changshu counties to arrest the bandits within a limited time and investigate the matter thoroughly.

<h3>News from Various Unions</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Fifth Wharf Employees Union has repeatedly requested the union to urge the head office to pay the back wages of the China Merchants Fifth Warehouse staff for August of last year to maintain their livelihoods. After the resignation of General Manager Li, the negotiations became even more difficult. As a result, only a postdated check for one and a half months was issued to perfunctorily settle the matter. However, a bonus equivalent to one and a half months' salary in cash was suddenly issued to senior officials of the head office, causing dissatisfaction among the Fifth Warehouse staff. Because the Fifth Warehouse staff usually work harder than the head office staff, they have requested the union to seriously negotiate with the head office in the hope of enjoying the same treatment as the head office staff.

<h3>Zhou Ronggui</h3>
<p>Bravely Captures a Thief</p>
<p>Even with a Gunshot Wound, Did Not Relinquish Grip</p>
<p>The Police Authorities Should Issue an Award</p>
<p>Zhou Ronggui was walking along the boundary road opposite the North Railway Station, near the entrance of Ruiqing Lane the night before last at noon when, by chance, the Hengda Cigarette Paper Shop was being robbed of four hundred and fifty yuan in large and small bills and foreign currency by five armed robbers. Zhou immediately bravely captured one of the thieves, which led to the robber gang firing two shots in succession, one bullet hitting his left leg. However, Zhou, enduring the pain, did not relinquish his grip even slightly. The robber gang was still intending to continue shooting when detectives Wang Jinshou and Shang Wu, along with detective Chen Dabao, etc. from the foreign constabulary rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. The remaining robbers then fled with the stolen goods. The detectives found a bullet and a shell casing each along the way. They brought the thief captured by Zhou back to the police station. After questioning, they learned that the thief's name was Wang Fucai, from Chongming, and he was immediately taken into custody. They also transported Zhou to the hospital by car. The doctor examined him and found that although his left leg had been pierced by a bullet, it was not a vital injury. After applying medicine and bandaging, he was immediately sent home to recuperate. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the thief Wang to the Special District Local Court. After Judge Ge questioned him, according to the police lawyer, based on the report of the shop owner Chen Yunqing at the time, the total amount of cash and foreign currency stolen was four hundred and fifty yuan. However, this morning Chen again reported to the police that he had found four hundred yuan in bills and coins in the drawer. This amount may have been left behind by the robbers when they fled, so the actual loss was only four yuan in silver dollars, forty-six cents in silver coins, and a cotton robe worth ten yuan. Judge Ge then briefly questioned the victim, witnesses, and defendant, and ordered Wang Fucai to be remanded in custody to await the arrest of the robbers who were still at large and reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3>Two Westerners as Thieves</h3>
<p>A Farce at the Chartered Bank Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>One Thief Made a Noise to Make People Turn Around</p>
<p>One Thief Suddenly Snatched One Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Chinese Police at the Entrance Intercepted the Stolen Goods and Thief</p>
<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reported that a Westerner named Junes Hennequin was carrying nearly four thousand yuan to the Chartered Bank on the Bund yesterday morning to deposit it. Just as he was taking out the money to place it on the counter, about to hand it over to the bank clerk, another Westerner suddenly made a noise from behind, as if asking a question. As Junes looked back, another Westerner suddenly snatched one thousand yuan in cash and fled. Fortunately, he was intercepted by a Chinese policeman at the entrance, and Junes was spared the loss. However, the Westerner who made the questioning noise escaped in the meantime. The police are currently investigating. It is believed that these two men are accomplices who were waiting in the bank for an opportunity to commit the robbery.</p>
<h3>Record of Being Deceived After Enlisting in the Army</h3>
<p>Jin Shouyan's Heart is Too Cruel</p>
<p>Wang Longyou Has Nowhere to Turn</p>
<p>Wang Longyou, a 22-year-old from Chaoxian County, Anhui, worked as a goods weigher at the Pinghan Railway Bureau in Beiping. A man named Jin Shouyan, who lived at No. 14 Jianguochang, Huguo Temple, Beiping, was particularly cunning. Because he met Wang from time to time, the two became friends. Later, they talked about their living problems. Wang revealed his impoverished state, saying that his salary was not high enough to make ends meet. Jin suddenly claimed that Xu Tingyao, the current commander of the 4th Division of the Army, was a good friend of his and that his troops were stationed in Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He suggested that the two of them go to the army to make a living, go to Hangzhou to visit Commander Xu, and ask him to recommend them for two positions, believing that they would definitely succeed. Wang believed it to be true. On the 24th of last month, he prepared his luggage at home and brought one hundred yuan in travel expenses. He followed Jin on the train to Tianjin, then transferred to the Japanese ship "Nomagaru" to Shanghai. They stayed at the Huhang Hotel on Haining Road. On the 28th, they took the train to Hangzhou again and stayed at room number 23 of the Hangbu Public Guesthouse. They lingered for several days. By the 3rd of this month, they still had not met Commander Xu. Unexpectedly, while Wang was sound asleep that night, Jin stole Wang's suitcase and fled the hotel without a trace. Inside was a set of cyan Western-style clothing, a black overcoat, and fifty-seven yuan. Wang suffered this blow. All he had left was forty cents to use as fare to return to Shanghai, which was not enough. He went to the ticket office at the train station and begged in every possible way before he was allowed to board a fourth-class passenger car back to Shanghai. Moreover, as a stranger in Shanghai, he had no way to borrow money. He sold a felt hat and a shirt on the way to maintain a few days of life. Yesterday, because he had not a penny to his name, seeing that he had reached a dead end, he conceived a world-weary thought. At around 9:00 a.m., he hired sampan number 208 at the Shunzhang Wharf in Hongkou, falsely claiming that he was crossing the river to Pudong. He sailed to the middle of the river and then threw himself into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was rescued by the boatman and was able to live again. He was sent to the Water Police Station and confessed his past, saying that his father's name was Xi Chou and that he was a clerk on the Pinghan Railway Bridge in Beiping, etc., while shedding tears. The police station sent patrolman Deng Jiagen to the Anhui Fellow Association in the French Concession at the intersection of Rue Lupan and Rue Paul Beau to seek relief and send him back to his hometown to avoid becoming a starving corpse and repeating the suicide.</p>
<h3>Spring Fish from Wusong Arrive on the Market</h3>
<p>The First Batch of Spring Fish Has Not Yet Appeared</p>
<p>The Second Batch Imported Yesterday</p>
<p>Pirates Still Not Eliminated</p>
<p>Two Fishing Boats Kidnapped</p>
<p>The long-awaited Wusong spring fish (commonly known as northern yellow croaker) began to be imported yesterday morning with the arrival of a fishing boat. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The First Batch Has Not Appeared. The spring fish are produced in the northern sea area around Maojiasha outside the Wusong estuary, about two hundred li from Songjiang. In previous years, the first batch of spring fish was released after the Grain Rain solar term, and fishing boats could cast their nets to catch them. This year, because the weather is cold, the spring fish do not want to float to the surface, so the first batch has not been released, and the fishing boats have no way to catch them.</p>
<p>Import Situation. The second batch of spring fish began to be imported yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m. A boat named Xu Fulong arrived, carrying five holds of fish. There was no need to pay taxes after mooring because the fish tax has been waived this year, so after the customs inspected the holds, they were immediately unloaded and sold by the Baofeng Fish Shop. The price was set at six yuan and five jiao per seventy jin. Fishmongers and customers all scrambled to buy them. By around 2:00 p.m., they had all been sold out, and those who arrived later were disappointed. Large groups of fishing boats are expected to arrive successively today.</p>
<p>Two Boats Kidnapped. According to the fishing boat crew who arrived, although the pirates outside the Wusong estuary have been severely suppressed by the army, they are still rampant, appearing here and disappearing there. It was seen that two fishing boats, Gao Wanshun and Xu Wantai, also on the sea, were surrounded by several pirate ships and kidnapped, heading towards Yanchengkou. There are still more than a thousand boats casting their nets to catch fish in the sea. Hearing this news, many are hesitant to sail south and many fishing boats have changed their route and sailed to Qingdao to sell their catch, so the number of boats arriving in Songjiang must be less than in previous years.</p>
<h3>Buddha's Birthday</h3>
<p>Jingan Temple Incense Message</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Restricts Stalls</p>
<p>Jingan Temple Asks to Revoke the Order</p>
<p>The ancient temple of Jingan Temple in western Shanghai is a famous scenic spot in Shanghai. Every year, on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month of the lunar calendar, the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha, there is a grand gathering. There are many pilgrims and tourists to the temple, and more than a thousand vendors gather to set up stalls to sell domestic goods and local products, and the transactions are quite large. This year, the Public Works Department, in an unprecedented move, restricted the stalls on the grounds of obstructing traffic. The stallholders were panicked and petitioned the Public Works Department and Jingan Temple, demanding that the restriction be lifted. The Public Works Department's proclamation and Jingan Temple's official letter are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Public Works Department Proclamation (No. 4086 Regarding Restrictions on the Incense Market): It is hereby proclaimed that the incense market has been held annually in the Jingan Temple area on the day of the Bathing Buddha Festival. In recent years, it has often caused traffic chaos and hindered the convenience of the public. In order to try to remedy the situation, the incense market to be held on May 24 of this year should be restricted. The goods sold in the incense market and the items sold by the stalls should be limited to agricultural by-products, such as baskets and bamboo ware, rattan ware, and other legitimate necessities of farmers, in order to conform to the original intention of establishing the incense market. Any stall that is a sales point for items other than agricultural by-products is in violation of the original intention of establishing the incense market and should be prohibited. This proclamation is hereby made known to all. May 8, 1931, Western calendar, Deputy Director-General Mackie.</p>
<p>Jingan Temple Official Letter: Respectfully, last month, our temple sent a letter to your department regarding the issue of setting up stalls for the Buddha's Birthday, earnestly requesting your department to maintain the thousand-year-old grand gathering and preserve the customary practice of setting up stalls. The other day, we were honored by the visit of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, director of your department, and Mr. Maiting, chief inspector, who presented our temple with a map restricting the setting up of stalls, instructing us to forward it to the stallholders to follow. We immediately stated that this is a thousand-year-old custom and that we have no right to change it, and we dared not comply with the order. After carefully examining the map, we are deeply suspicious. According to the map, the roads listed are the original places where stalls have been set up for many years. Now, only one-quarter of the stalls are allowed to be set up, and all the stallholders have prepared their own local products for a year to sell. Therefore, this restriction will cause many to be disappointed, which is a matter of concern for the livelihood of the poor for a year. This is the first point. The number of stalls is small, but the number of old stallholders for many years is many times greater. This will inevitably lead to disputes over the stall sites, causing trouble. This is the second point. The stalls are scattered and isolated, and their business will inevitably be sluggish. This will hinder the livelihood of the poor and the solemnity of our Buddha's Birthday. This is the third point. Recently, some stallholders have learned of your department's restriction order and have been petitioning around our temple every day, requesting that the old practice be followed. Yesterday, we received a joint official letter from the stallholders (the original letter is copied and attached below), requesting that our temple ask your department to revoke the order restricting the setting up of stalls. We have granted this request. We secretly investigate that the restriction is similar to banning the setting up of stalls, and it abolishes the thousand-year-old grand gathering of Buddha's Birthday in an invisible way. Moreover, this matter was stipulated in the land lease contract between our ancestor, Monk Zhengsheng, and your office in 1899, Western calendar. According to the contract, the annual Buddha's Birthday incense market is lively and allows each to arbitrarily set up stalls to catch the market. The regulations have a clear legal basis. Any relationship must not be changed or restricted. Therefore, we respectfully request your department to sympathize with the suffering of the stallholders' livelihood, seek the public welfare of the society and people's livelihood, revoke the order restricting the setting up of stalls, and continue to fulfill the conditions stipulated by both parties according to the old customs of the year, in order to appease the public and conform to the law. Now, according to the proposition of the benefactors of our temple, if the contract is not effective, it should be terminated. Therefore, we return the map restricting the land and earnestly request your department to understand and grant our request. We are extremely grateful. This is for the attention of the directors and director-general of the Shanghai English Public Works Department. Abbot Zhifa of Jingan Temple.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Xiaofang Photographic Paper Sells Well Nationwide</p>
<p>Good Quality and Low Price Are Its Characteristics</p>
<p>The photography industry advances with a country's culture. In the past, the photographic materials used by Chinese people came entirely from Europe and the United States, and the amount of money flowing out each year was unknown. Since last year, the Xiaofang Photographic Chemical Industry Factory has launched Chinese photographic paper, named Aina Light Paper. Photographic studios value patriotism and have adopted it in droves because of its good quality and low price, thereby preventing the leakage of wealth. Starting in March of this year, the factory added types and released full-gloss, semi-gloss, and matte, each divided into one, two, three, and four grades, totaling twelve types. All types of photographic paper are fully stocked, making it more convenient for users. Except for a few provinces in China, all provinces have managers and agents. The prosperity of business in all directions is improving rapidly. This is also a new and emerging industry worthy of praise in the midst of advocating domestic goods.</p>

He reported to the police chief yesterday morning and ordered Chief Inspector Wang Chengying, Chinese detectives Qiu Zhanqing, Shen Tianbao, etc., to go to the address with detectives sent by the French Police Department to arrest them. The landlord of the building claimed that the tenants who lived there had moved to No. 5 Wende Lane, Kangjia Bridge, Jisi Feier Road, in western Shanghai on April 30.

<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association recently received a report from righteous people that Yuan Lu, a woman from Shangyu in her 60s, living at No. 4 Dunren Lane, Doushi Street, Nanshi, had a 5-year-old maid named Xiaomei.

Mr. Wang first went to the jurisdiction of District Chief Chen to consult. District Chief Chen ordered patrolman Ma Hualin and police officer Fang No. 72 to accompany Mr. Wang to the destination to thoroughly investigate. After detailed questioning and careful inspection, it was found that Xiaomei had been taken away by her biological mother a few days ago, and Yuan Lu said that she did not know where she had gone. It was impossible to pursue the matter for the time being. However, Yuan Lu has raised as many as three maids for Xiaomei, which shows her intention. According to reports, Xiaomei was seriously ill when she was taken away by her biological mother. It is unknown whether she was caused by abuse. Therefore, Director Wang finally obtained the consent of patrolman Ma to order Yuan Lu to hand over Xiaomei for inspection within one week, or to ask her biological mother to interview her, otherwise she would be sent to the bureau for investigation and would not be lenient. After one week, the investigation was carried out as agreed, but the Yuan family could not find the mother and daughter, so they took Yuan Lu's son, Shuping, to the First District Office, where he was questioned in detail by District Officer Pan. Director Wang served as a witness and testified truthfully. Yuan's son also admitted it without denial and also opposed his mother's position on this matter. As a result, the office re-examined and temporarily released him on bail pending the prosecution of the abused girl's mother.</p>
<h3>Trade Union Committee</h3>
<p>Bribery Case Has Been Indicted</p>
<p>Former Trade Union Committee members Tan Huanxiang, Hong Dongyi, etc., were bribed by the capital of Wusong Yong'an No. 2 Factory to order the executive committee members of the factory's trade union, Yan Gunian, Jin Fan, etc., to resign. Then, worker Li Yixiong came forward to accuse the trade union of being bad, and the leadership concealed the truth, causing the trade union to be ordered to stop its activities. Later, the Municipal Executive Committee and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau found out and detained Tan et al. on bail and then fled again. Now, this case has been ordered by the Central Party Department to the High Court to instruct the Shanghai Local Court to thoroughly investigate it, so the prosecutor has filed a public prosecution. Judge Wu continued the trial yesterday and summoned Lin Meiyan, a cadre of the Municipal Party Department's Civil Training Committee, Guo Yongxi, a staff member of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhu Guilin, an investigator, to the court to testify. The defendants who arrived were Liu Xun, Deng Yutian (former party affairs workers), Yan Gunian, Jin Fan (former trade union executive committee members), Guo Shun (Yong'an manager), Lin Pingying (general affairs), Chen Hanjian (secretary), and Li Yixiong (worker). During the questioning, those related to the party side claimed that they did not know the content, those related to Yan et al. said that it was a planned resignation to obtain evidence and then report it, those related to the capital side said that they did not use bribery, and Li Yixiong said that his accusation of the trade union was not a problem in this case. However, because this case still needs to be investigated, the debate has not yet been opened and will be continued after the summons.</p>
<h3>Female Teacher</h3>
<p>Sues Husband for Not Fulfilling His Promise</p>
<p>Judge Advises Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation</p>
<p>Liang Xuexin, a female teacher who has been working in the education field and is currently teaching at a certain middle school on North Sichuan Road, is originally from Guangdong and is 27 years old. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, she married Chen Changyi, a fellow villager who opened Delong Fruit Shop on Wusong Road, through a matchmaker. At first, they were quite harmonious. Chen also set up a fruit shop in Tianjin, and the business of transporting fresh seasonal fruits between the two places was very good, so Chen also often went to Tianjin to manage the business, while Liang taught in Shanghai. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Chen wrote to Liang from Tianjin, ordering her to go to Tianjin to live with him. Unexpectedly, the letter was sent several times and there was no reply, and he misunderstood that Liang had other intentions, and the opinions became discordant. Soon after, he married Wu Youfen, the daughter of a wealthy family in Tianjin, and sent a letter to inform Liang. Liang believed that he intended to abandon her. On October 16 of the 18th year of the Republic of China, she filed a petition with the former Provisional Court, begging for relief. Chen begged relatives from both sides to reconcile outside the court and signed a covenant, including (1) depositing 4,000 yuan in the bank as a guarantee, and the withdrawal must be signed by the witnesses Lu Tingsheng and Gao Jieyuan, and the parties concerned; (2) the defendant bears the litigation costs of 195 yuan at that time; (3) the defendant pays Liang 50 yuan per month for household expenses; (4) Wu Youfen said that he has the status of a concubine, etc., for a total of seven articles. Unexpectedly, after the covenant was signed, Chen only deposited 2,000 yuan in the bank, and he did not fulfill the 50 yuan per month paid to Liang. He also never met Wu Youfen. After repeated negotiations, there was no result. He believed that he intended to violate the covenant, so he hired lawyer Wang Siji to file a civil lawsuit with the Special Zone Court, requesting a judgment to fulfill the covenant. The complaint briefly stated that she married the defendant through a matchmaker in October of the ninth year of the Republic of China. After the marriage, she went to Tianjin with the defendant to do business. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the defendant married Wu Youfen and became a concubine, which caused discord and resentment. On October 16 of the 18th year of the Republic of China, she filed a petition with the former Provisional Court, requesting a judgment to provide for maintenance. At that time, the defendant was willing to reconcile and begged relatives and friends to sign a covenant. Unexpectedly, the defendant has not fulfilled the covenant to this day, requesting a judgment to fulfill the covenant, etc. Yesterday, this case was tried in the Civil Court No. 10. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated his opinion. The defendant did not arrive, and lawyer Ge acted as his agent and stated that Chen Changyi's business has been unfavorable in recent years and he is unable to provide for maintenance due to the actual situation. The plaintiff is a very self-reliant person, and his teaching income is enough for self-sufficiency. According to the obligation of mutual assistance between husband and wife, the plaintiff should also assist Chen Changyi in his difficult times. Now, he is being sued for not providing alimony, requesting to advise him to reconcile outside the court, etc. The plaintiff only needs the defendant to fulfill the covenant and is quite likely to reconcile. The judge then instructed both parties to attempt reconciliation outside the court.</p>
<h3>Zhou Weisan Drowned Himself in the Sea</h3>

<p>Zhou Weisan, a 22-year-old from Jiashan, Zhejiang, was in the porcelain business. Due to family affairs and environmental pressures, he conceived the idea of ​​ending his life by suicide. He took the train to Fort Baotai, Wusong, the day before yesterday and jumped into the river, drowning on the spot. However, when he left Shanghai, he told his friend that he was going to Songjiang to play, but his words revealed a state of world-weariness and resentment. Therefore, the friend informed his father, Zhou Liansun, by letter. Zhou's father rushed to Wusong after receiving the letter. The Wusong Lifesaving Bureau's patrol boat found a male floating corpse in the river at Fort Baotai yesterday and immediately took it to the Lifesaving Bureau's pier. At this time, the corpse's father had also arrived, but his face had already rotted and it was difficult to identify. However, the colors of the clothes worn by the corpse were indeed his son's. He requested that the corpse be exempted from examination and then carried it back to his hometown for burial by his father.</p>

<p>The He Rong small steamer of the Tongli Inland River Steamer Company, which runs on the Shanghai-Dangkou route, set off from Dangkou fully loaded with goods and passengers on the 5th of this month at 3:00 p.m. When it was sailing to Nanhengjing, only a few miles away from Batang, it was just after 5:00 p.m. when suddenly two pirate boats came, and more than 20 pirates with blue cloth tied around their heads as a mark, speaking in a northern accent and a Chaohu accent, each holding a pistol box gun, etc., shouted to stop the steamer. The steamer knew it was a pirate boat and increased its speed to escape. The pirates then opened fire. The steamer had to stop.

<h3>The Case of Fraudulently Obtaining a Deed</h3>
<p>Ma Zhichao is Given a Deadline to Hand Over the Deed</p>
<p>Gu Zizhen, a 40-year-old Yunnanese who once held an important position in the military, lives at No. 95 Route Massenet in the French Concession. Gu has been in the military for many years and has held prominent positions, so he has a small amount of savings. He once purchased several plots of land worth tens of thousands of yuan in Route Massenet and originally planned to build his own house, but due to economic difficulties, he was unable to do so for a long time. Until last summer, Gu happened to meet his friend Ma Zhichao, a Guangxi native, and told him the truth. Ma, who worked at the Global Trading Company in this port and was engaged in real estate, saw this as a good opportunity and ordered Gu to hand over all the deeds for verification first, and then he could advance the money to build the house. After the construction was completed, he would return the deeds. At that time, Gu believed it to be true, so on June 10 of last year, he handed over several documents, including French Deed No. 1375, French Deed No. 306, and American Deed No. 1804, to Ma for safekeeping. Ma issued a receipt as proof. Unexpectedly, after Ma obtained the deeds, he immediately mortgaged them to Puyi Real Estate Company and obtained 75,000 taels of silver. After the construction was completed, Gu asked Ma to return the deeds. Ma delayed in every possible way. After repeated requests, Ma only returned French Deed No. 1375 on November 12 of last year, and refused to return the remaining two documents. After repeated requests to no avail, Gu realized that Ma had bad intentions, so he was forced to hire lawyer Jin Yu to file a complaint against Ma with the French Concession Court, accusing Ma of fraudulently obtaining the deed by means of construction, and of committing the crime of fraud and defrauding under Article 363, Paragraph 1 of the New Criminal Law, requesting that he be punished according to law. He was summoned and the trial was opened once on the morning of the day before yesterday. As a result, the court ordered Ma to pay 44,000 taels of silver and bail, and to hand over the deed within a specified period for the court to decide. However, Ma was unable to find a suitable guarantee at that time, so he is still in custody.</p>

He immediately took her to the station. Station Chief Zhang determined that the girl was wearing a floral cotton-padded coat, a blue cotton-padded jacket, black cloth socks, and black striped cotton-padded pants, and had a braid. She resembled a villager. Upon questioning, she identified herself as Lu Xiaomei, 11 years old, from Pudong, currently residing at 16 Lujiawan. Because her birth mother had passed away, she was now being arbitrarily beaten and scolded by her stepmother, making her life unbearable, which is why she ran away. It was intended to notify her parents to come and claim her, but the girl refused to go home. The case was referred to the Public Security Bureau for handling.</p>

<p>One Young Child Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, detectives Yang A泉 and others from the Harbin Police Station apprehended six individuals suspected of involvement in a robbery at 52 Huade Road and 729 Beikai'er Road. The suspects were men and women named Liu Weibao, Deng Haiping, Li Xiangqi, Liu Xiao'erzi, Li Chenshi, and Liu Yinshi. Two pistols, thirty-two bullets, and two leather wallets were seized. They were handed over to Judge Feng of the Special District Local Court for interrogation. According to the police lawyer, Li Chenshi and Liu Yinshi had little involvement in the case, and Li Chenshi was near childbirth. He requested that they be released on bail. Although Liu Xiao'erzi was a young child, he specialized in secretly delivering firearms for robbers and should be closely watched. The two leather wallets seized were undoubtedly stolen goods as they had Japanese writing on them. Further investigation was needed, and a request was made for a postponement of the trial. Judge Feng briefly questioned each defendant and granted bail to the two women, ordering them to be available for questioning at any time. The remaining individuals were detained pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>

After several summonses, Judge Tang ruled that the plaintiff's claims were insufficient and should be dismissed. Dissatisfied with the initial verdict, the tenants, represented by Wan Long, Tian Ji Tang, Ding Fushan, Wu Ziqin, and others, hired lawyer Yao Zhaodi to appeal, requesting a retrial. The appeal was approved, and the defendant was summoned yesterday but did not appear. The defendant's lawyer appeared instead. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that his side had important questions for the defendant and that the defendant must appear in person for the trial to proceed.

<h3>Today's Female Explorers</h3>
<p>—Fu Lan</p>
<p>Women today are vying for equality with men in all aspects of life. However, some say that women are not suited to be explorers. But since the Royal Geographical Society of Britain approved Mrs. Ness's membership, making her the first female member of the society, the question of whether women can be valuable explorers has generally been resolved. The approval process was lengthy and interesting. In fact, European women have been exploring in lesser-known areas for a long time, but most of them have been prevented from expressing their talents by various obstacles, especially the opposition of men.</p>
<p>About fifty years ago, the president of the Royal Geographical Society of Britain suggested that a woman be admitted as a member. But this proposal shook the members' hearts so much that they discussed it intermittently for eight months before finally dropping the matter. This situation still existed today, but since the fearless African explorer Miss Bird resolutely refused the society's invitation to narrate her experiences unless she was allowed to join as the first female member, the male members reluctantly relented.</p>
<p>Female explorers have made rich gains, but they are still suspected, and the opposition among male members is so strong that they have made rules not to allow female members to be realized, so naturally no new female members are allowed to join. Finally, at the suggestion of Lord Curzon, it was agreed to allow women to join as usual. In fact, the Scottish Geographical Society had already recognized female explorers, which suppressed all opposition. Today, hundreds of women can claim the right and patent to join, and they can take comfort in the fact that their early pioneers who traveled thousands of miles sought these rights and patents but ultimately could not obtain them.</p>
<p>Although some people still do not believe that exploration and everything associated with it are suitable for women, the work of Mrs. R. Forbes alone is enough to prove that modern women have found their place in the geographical world. Based on her ability and wisdom, she has collected a lot of valuable information. Her accurate description of everything she saw has been of great help to scientific research, not just using her pleasant attitude to tell ordinary people.</p>
<p>Lady Dorothy Mills has been very active in Haiti in the West Indies, the Nile River basin in Africa, and Timbuktu in French West Africa, creating many valuable records. Miss Smith's exploratory heart is never satisfied unless she explores places far from civilization. Many of her journeys have taken her inside the homes of native peoples, and she has found particular pleasure in practicing the use of blowguns and poison darts. She has circled the globe several times, and many of the places she has traveled have never been visited by women before.</p>
<p>Hanghton Rogers has explored 30,000 miles in the interior of South America, and Ada Boyland has traveled 6,000 miles in Persia, living in the tents of native peoples to make her investigations more reliable, giving us a lot of knowledge about Eastern geography.</p>
<p>Many women do not explore alone but work with their husbands, achieving very valuable results. Mrs. Court Mreatt used this method to explore Africa, surveying and investigating all the way. In addition to practical oxcart travel and on-site discoveries, they rely heavily on photography, because it often leaves indescribable value after exploration. If you ask any female explorer whether she would rather abandon her camera or her defensive pistol, she would definitely rather give up the latter.</p>
<p>Wandering is the first step for many women to start exploring. They have an innate curiosity about new things, which immediately arouses their interest. In a very short time, they can find out everything they can and then record their impressions.</p>
<p>Restlessness, fatigue, and danger often envelop this work, but the fearless women have long been overcome by their competitive spirit and pay very little attention to their own safety. This is so admirable. Once a woman becomes an explorer, she gets rid of this cowardly and lazy temperament unless the environment forces her to.</p>
<p>Women's love of exploration is never limited by age. Doris Dinham, at the age of only 22, has traveled 2,000 miles across the African wilderness with native guides. Many materials can be gathered from her experience. She has passed through cannibalistic tribes, she has been lost in the forest, she has spent the night next to a tree, she has been chased by ferocious natives. In addition, she has wandered in the deserted forest for fourteen days.</p>
<p>Although women are generally not considered good at making maps, many female explorers quickly acquire a map-making skill. There are many valuable examples to prove this. One noteworthy retrospective is that during the European War, when the Western European front needed maps of various places, the Royal Geographical Society of Britain was ordered to produce them. At that time, many women were selected to take on this role. Mrs. Reynolds can be considered the best of them. Some of Russia's one-millionth-scale maps were directly printed from her hands and still exist in the world today.</p>
<p>The value of a woman's work does not stop even when her exploration is over. Every report she gathers has a considerable contribution to the scientific community and is well preserved by people. In short, women's contributions to geography will be greater and greater in the future.</p>
