<p>記者在靑年之出路一評中。已痛陳萎靡因循。爲目前靑年茫無出路之大因。冀以鞭策靑年。發展其本能。從創造中謀個人以至社會之出路今請更反而向社會負有領導靑年之責者進一言。非敢嘵嘵。要亦有事實可據。今人一談及靑年。輒颦首蹙額。不勝其悲觀嘆息。或謂靑年好亂。或謂靑年惡化。或謂靑年輕浮。或謂靑年中無人材。自暴者不足與有言。自棄者不足與有爲目。前靑年之無出路。皆爲靑年自已造出。自其一方面觀之。似尙言之有理。但試一究此現象之根因。則此種論調恰如投人於水。更沉以石。靑年何辜。蒙此巨冤。夫靑年爲國有元氣。社會繼往開來之橋樑。視今日靑年羣衆之優良與否。即可知來日國家之興替。關係重要。有如是者。是故吾人今日徒責備靑年厭惡靑年。而不積極助靑年。適足以加重國家社會前途之危機。吾人今日所應痛切反省者。第一。敎育是否確能盡其使命。發展其機能。第二。社會現實是否能予靑年以好的印象。第三。吾人負有領導靑年之責者。是否確已盡領導之責。敎育不能導靑年入正路。社會不能使靑年有良好環境。負有領袖靑年之責者。又不能循循善誘。糾正靑年之過失。甚且牆高百仞。隔靑年於千里之外。彼心性未定。閱歷毫無之靑年。一入社會。即四顧茫然。而試探之魔手。復從而多方誘惑。欲求靑年不入歧途不趨消極。是何能得。記者敢以摰誠懇求世之責備靑年者。先指導靑年。厭惡靑年者。先認識靑年。</p>

<p>國民二日巴黎電　法美談判原定今晚九時三十分續開、經法總理與外財兩長商榷後、已展至明晨舉行、因法國對於胡佛總統節略内、尙有若干部份須請加以解釋、故今日法内閣集議時、曾將胡佛總統節略提出討論、認該節略已有充分進步、可使法美談判繼續進行、今日下午法財長佛蘭亭又訪美財長梅隆美大使愛治於美大使署、談話甚久、聞所論爲英國召集楊格簽字國會議之結果、</p>

<p>就上表所示。即不加半字評斷。其利害亦已足使吾人不寒而慄。至於其他日人正在窮思熟慮者。更不知其如何矣。協商至今。尙未正式集議。三月六日、我方代表高紀毅氏曾與日本木村氏作一次非正式之談話。彼此申述意見。木村提出上述四項問題後。（報紙僅載提案。未詳内容）高氏當答以前二項非本人權限所能論及、本人第能以鐵道當局資格。討論鐵道實際問題。即第三項與第四項。日方不妨申述意見。當代爲轉逹鐵道部及高級官署。一次談話後。至今尙未正式進行。大槪雙方代表都正在充分準備。以資正式集議時相衡折衝。在未正式集議以前。實際情况。局外人殊不易探得。不過根據高紀毅氏與木村會晤時談話。對於權限問題。體認頗眞。用心綦細、消極之限制。亦未始不可以使日人之鬼蜮技倆無所施展。蓋國際交涉。主持者之態度言論。都極關重要。切忌含糊、更忌敷衍。但亦不能於權限之外。有若何言論與行動。蓋一國之利害。全操諸三數代表之手。一言之失。即足以鑄成九洲之錯。吾人但思不久以前。伯力會議中之越權訂立條約事件。至今猶有餘痛。故對於此次協商之吾方代表諸君。不得不企望其於此點鄭重注意。總之自光緖三十一年以迄於現在二十五年來中日間之鐵道交涉。每一次我國都處於失敗地位。每一次都爲日人之威脅利誘所降伏。過去之外交成績。都爲今日之傷心資料。亦即爲今日東北鐵道動受束縛之所由來。此次日人以絕大之野心。一貫之政策而又以精密之考慮。充分之準備。計劃作一勞永逸之交涉。務必使我東北三省入於其天羅地網之中無可逃遁。甚且表示「行使必需手段」及「斷然部署發動」其態度之强硬。已可想見。協商之棘手。亦不難預測。而我方代表諸君之責任。更因環境之嚴重而益以加重。過去二十五年已令吾人深感弱國無外交之恥辱。及桎梏銬鐐之重負、切盼今後之交涉。能闢一新紀元。此次日人果基於親善和平共存共榮之立脚點上以誠意協商兩國鐵道上之實際問題。吾人固亦願以誠意協商。否則寗使會不開協商不成。無結果以散。决不能遷就敷衍、平平了事。使我東北鐵道東北三省以至我國國家陷於萬刦不復之地位。代表諸君之責任愈重而吾人亦愈覺爲之惕惕危懼。悄悄憂心。莫可自抑、往者不可諫、來者猶可追。吾人當謹拭目之俟此次協商之好者也。雖然。一國際交涉上之失敗與勝利。其關鍵不僅在於少數代表。實繫乎民族之是否能一致團結。此次鐵道協商。日方朝野上下個人團體。廣大宣傳。積極主張。對於此事之熱烈。殆如瘋如狂。反觀我國除遼寗外交協會。瀋陽各團體聯席會議。吉林學界組織之中日鐵道交涉後援會。天津對日外交後援會。及南開學校少數團體以有組織之行動。宣言抗議日人之侵略。並督促我方代表外、他處殆無應聲。夫日人之侵犯我東北。非東北局部問題。實關係我整個國家與民族之存亡。往日以國人對外交漠視。造成今日東北之危機。此後滿不在意漫不經心之泱泱大國態度。詎容再有。大地陸沉同歸於盡。此日蜿蜒縱横於白山黑水間之日本軌道。即爲我國家吭喉致我死命之繩索。國人再不覺醒。更待何時。國難當前。何事不可捐棄。一致團結。共謀此次協商之勝利。亦即所以爲準備收回旅大及南滿路之先聲。否則空口呐喊。寗非徒勞。尤有進者。一八九八年之旅大租借條約。早已滿期。中東路一部之南滿支綫。亦將於明年滿期。雖日人於民國四年以威脅手段强迫我國承認二十一條。關於旅大與南滿路都展期至九十九年。但此種片面壓迫造成之條約。我國早已根本否認。决不能取爲根據。此時我政府與國人對於收回。旅大與贖回南滿路問題。亦應及早準備務以寗爲玉碎。不爲瓦全之精神。求主權之收回。視此次協商之結果。即可以爲明年收回主權交涉之預測。關鍵重大。時危勢迫。作者敢以此文爲國人告急文書。至於東北鐵道之危機。暇當作文另論。（完）</p>

<p>福州大水災</p>
<p>福州班輪到閩後、近輙誤期脫班、三北公司萬象輪昨已由福州來滬、記者爲明瞭阻航原因、特往訪劉船主、探詢一切、始悉福州發生大水災之空前慘劇、田廬盡淹、屍體暴露、且令滬閩航船受重大損失、茲特詳誌如下、</p>
<p>南台盡成澤國　福州此次大水災、開始於六月二十六日、連日大雨不止、以致山洪暴發、水之來源、自延平冲入閩江、奔赴南台、查南台爲福州商業最盛之區、大商號林立、此次大水驟發、南台各街市、盡成澤國、水勢最盛之時、有一丈左右、商店居戶、盡被淹沒、街市中逃難人民、均駕駛船舶往來、貨物冲毀、房屋倒壞、人民蕩析離居、其損失之巨、受禍之慘、實爲數年來所罕見、</p>
<p>屍體蔽江而下　三北萬象輪、由滬赴閩、在駛進閩江而至馬尾時、正値大水災之第二天、沿途行駛、見閩江内浮屍纍纍、沿江而下、飄浮水上、並無撈埋之人、此項屍體、多由南台及福州城外被水淹斃者、隨流冲下、而沿江更有被冲壞之商貨物件、與倒塌之房屋木料等等、觸目皆是、</p>
<p>海關浸入水中　閩海關設在海關埕、該處亦爲大水冲淹之區、致閩關房屋、沒入水中、下層辦事處、已成河流、在關辦事人員、均遷入最高一層樓上、每日關員往來、均用小船渡駛、而商帮之報關納稅者、亦買棹而來、然以水災故、關上工作、亦幾無形停阻、</p>
<p>航運被水阻停　福州出口貨物向用駁船、在城内運出、到碼頭上輪、自大水災發生後、有多數商貨、已被水冲毀、亦有浸入水内、致遭損壞、其未受水害者、則因閩江大水、曳出駁船、不能載貨、遂停運三日、致上海到閩各商輪、均被水災延阻運貨、萬象輪多遲三日夜、其他商船之誤期四五天者亦有之、及至六月底、方始開裝、然而來貨已經大减、商帮更停止運輸、致萬象到滬、僅有二三成儎脚、劉君又言、該輪離閩時、水尙未退盡、上海運閩貨、亦將受重大之打擊矣、</p>

<h3 id="c147">雪蝶案續審 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>定十一日上午八時宣判</p>
<p>明星電影公司女演員胡蝶與其未婚夫林雪懷、因解除婚約、追償債項、涉訟於特區地方法院、經特院兩度集訊後、以須調查證據、延期至三月之久、調查手續、方始完備、爰通知兩造、並票傳人證、定期昨晨繼續審理、惟此案始終爲社會所注意、開庭之期宣傳後、一般欲先覩爲快者、至昨晨八時、羣赴特院旁聽、初因不知審理之法庭何在、故多</p>
<p>徘徊於廣塲之中　或趨各庭探詢、男女麕集、汗流浹背、不以爲苦、反以爲樂、迨九時半原告胡蝶及其父胡少貢、偕代表律師詹紀鳳到院、直登三樓之第一法庭、衆始知係假該庭審理、頓時蜂擁而上、時該庭之刑事案、尙未審畢、而入庭者、則紛至沓來、人聲尤雜、即經法警制止、秩序才克維持、逮周庭長將刑事案審畢退庭、已十時矣、俄而承審雪蝶一案之周達仁推事升座、首先查問所傳證人、則祇到明星公司</p>
<p>營業主任周劍雲　其餘安飛車行及趙輝三、雖前據胡蝶稱在法租界亞爾培路四十九號、但特院派吏往傳無着、故昨無人到案、被告林雪懷、直至周推事開庭後　偕其辯護律師鄂森·倪徵噢·報到、林衣佛蘭絨西裝、坐於律師席後排、胡衣白地紅花華爾紗衫、坐於證人席、</p>
<p>兩人之視線相對　却有咫尺天涯之槪、周推事隨命胡蝶站入證欄、將向已閉之工商銀行吊到之支票存根、着胡指出林雪懷所借用之欵項、胡逐紙諦視、即以鉛筆將凡給與林者、則書一林字、計有六紙、共洋一百九十九元二角、銀七十三兩、周推事繼將此項票根、轉給林閱、並詢以承認否、據林供、雖有借用支票之事、但欵項已於到期一日付還、倘原告果有欵相借、必有賬簿可憑、甚希望其將賬簿提出、以便淸算、至於購汽車之價銀、亦已給還、卾森律師即將向法界所捐之車照呈案、推事以林旣否認欠欵、因復問胡蝶以何方法證明、胡乃稱例如唐榮祥一欵、實係</p>
<p>林付給之西裝價　其他欠欵</p>
<p>、當時因彼此親戚關係、未便向索憑據、今彼明知我之公司已遭回祿、賬簿已燬於火、遂以交出賬簿相要挾、推事旋訊以能否不解除婚約、胡即答稱、事已如此、實無不解除婚約之理由、倘不解約、將來必須結婚、則可斷言無良好之結果、推事至此、傳證人周劍雲訊問年籍職業畢、命其具結後、據實陳述、周稱與林相識已七八年、與胡相識、僅三四載、林前爲明星演員、胡現亦爲明星演員　林胡訂婚時、我尙參預、嗣林僅演一片、即脫離明星、不常往來、我對此一對、</p>
<p>未婚夫婦之良緣　甚覺美滿</p>
<p>、迨至去年秋冬之間、因聞雙方有不滿意之風說、偶與胡談及、胡頗表示不滿、謂林將伊所給之資、任意揮霍、並與人跳舞、我深慮彼等之婚姻、發生障礙、曾以友誼相勸、希望其言歸於好、但胡雖表示不滿、即未露解約意、後又遇林、而林則因小報記載胡女士之行動、謂雖不能盡信、要亦不能無疑、雙方互起猜忌、至演成現今狀態、至胡女士向明星借欵六百元、當據胡云、係給林</p>
<p>做金子生意之用　及後以此</p>
<p>詢林、則亦否認、購買汽車、亦係胡向人所說、謂車價乃由伊給付、然林嗣亦不承、推事復傳林訊問、解約究竟由誰發動、林仍稱出自於胡、謂去年十一月十八日、因周劍雲函召、當往晤會、周以胡業偕其父妹等三至公司、請求援助解約相告、我即央周相勸、越日復往訪周、則云胡意堅决、無可挽回、我自（大報）登載胡行止不檢、聲名狼籍消息後、每次相見皆勸之、直至十一月十五以後、始未與見面、並於十一月二十八日致函提議、解除婚約、推事復向胡蝶訊問汝所</p>
<p>要求解約之理由　安在、胡稱已備叙於狀内、若以現在之情形論、更難維持、而被告之想維持婚約者、無非藉以不還欠欵、不賠損失、但被告旣倡議解約於先、且於信内明言恩斷義絕、則該婚約烏能維持、至其所欠貨欵一百八十五元、銀一百九十一兩、借欵一千三百八十五元、代向明星公司借欵六百元及汽車一輛、均應交還車價銀三百八十兩、此外應賠償損失一千元、此項損抶、係因訂婚三載、彼忽悔約、</p>
<p>使光陰等閒虚度　精神大受痛苦、應有相當之慰藉云云、而林則稱原告要求解約、須提出理由、否則不能同意、至所追各欵、林仍稱已經歸還、推事乃諭令開始辯論、先由原告律師詹紀鳳發言、所述約分兩部、（一）爲解除婚約部份、謂此項糾紛、起因於被告、將原告之金錢、任意在舞塲揮霍、經原告及其父親所目覩、加以規勸、被告乃惱羞成怒、遂致函原告、主張解約、原告猶留餘地、復函告以須在相當條件之下、方能容納此項主張、詎被告解約之心迫切、續函相促、足見</p>
<p>解約係被告主動　當然責任屬於被告、此外尙有一事足可證明者、即本案初次開審日、被告已將反訴狀刊諸報紙、狀内有解約之表示、雖該狀迄未見其呈案、然其解約决心、實已暴露、依民法親屬編九百七十六條規定、有重大事由發現、可要求解除婚約、被告前此種種行爲、自可認爲重大事由、故原告提起解約之訴、並依同法規定、無過失之一方、得向有過失之一方、要求損害賠償、本案過失、旣在被告、當然應令賠償相當損失、以資慰藉原告</p>
<p>所受精神之苦痛　（二）爲債務部份、經詹律師將所追各欵之理由、逐一聲述、請一併判令償還、並自起訴日起、至執行終了日之法定利息訟費、亦責令被告負擔、繼由被告律師鄂森·倪徵噢·起立答辯、首聲明林係已閉晨餐大王店主、</p>
<p>並非無職業之人　次言原告對於本案、僅可主張解約及解約之損失、與向明星所借六百元等三種、其餘欠欵部份、則該欵旣係胡蝶公司之資、應由其父控訴原告、未得其父合法委任、遽行控告、依法應予駁斥、末乃就原告所可主張之三項辯論、並謂被告提議、解除婚約之函件、原係要約性質、旣當時未經原告之同意、則該函之效力、已經喪失、自不負任何責任、至</p>
<p>原告要求之損失　旣未證明、而六百元之欵證據、亦復不充、請一併駁斥、周推事復傳胡少貢訊問胡蝶公司爲誰所開、胡稱係彼父女共同開設、此次訴追欠欵、後父女亦曾商議、然後併案起訴等語、被告律師因續聲辯一過、周推事遂諭辯論終結、定期七月十一日上午八時宣判、</p>

<p>昔時騷人雅士。大都嗜酒。如李白白居易等諸大名家。莫不有咏及酌酒之詩。藴藉風流。寄意雋永。故酒足爲文人消遣之資。新任國府委員兼代文官長葉楚傖氏。原爲滬濱名士。出身於新聞界。文章道德。盛稱一時。葉性喜麴蘖。暇時就膳必把盞。偶値淸宴。於燈紅酒綠之會。飛觴醉月。逸興遄飛。酒旣半酣。議論風生。闔座爲之增歡。尤爲雅趣。葉每於爲文之前。輒稍下醇醪。伏案假寐。宿酲旣醒。文思激發。以生花之筆。成藻麗之文。不假思索。一揮而就。一日。中央宣傳部長劉蘆隱宴客。中央組織部副部長張道藩及葉氏等均在座。偶談及葉氏爲文先下酒事。咸深佩葉氏之雅。席間。張戲謂葉曰。「公行年漸高。盍絕酒以保健康乎」。葉微笑。表示暫難與酒絕緣。名士風流。雅人深致。宜京中一時傳爲美談也</p>

<p>哈同初至滬時。僅爲洋行司閽之役。厥後以與行主合營土業及買地皮致富。始終得力於土。土在五行中主財。所謂有土此有財也。哈氏一生交土運。宜其爲活財神已。羅氏即其微時之伴侶。幸具慧眼。能識英雄。與哈氏結貧賤因緣。卒爲神仙眷屬焉。</p>

<p>張市長笑容可掬　國民政府代表張市長訓詞。異常懇摯。是日着白色中山服。講時笑容可掬。希望諸畢業同學勿負政府作育人材之苦心云云。次行政院代表市敎育局長徐君陶氏訓詞。大談諸發明家。如福特·愛迪孫等。皆一一引證。以勵諸生。</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>逆魚一小魚耳。然在吳興。則頗著名。魚與叉條魚相似。惟遍禮肥腴。嘴亦較團。加淸油透煑。味旣鮮美。而肉中不含細骨。尤稱特點。腹内多子。食之别具風味。故湖人之購逆魚也。辄擇取胸部實滿者。殆以子多足供大嚼耳。</p>
<p>逆魚平時不多見。每遇舊曆四五月間。霉汛初開。溪頭水漲。吳興四面多山。積雨横流。奔騰而下。於斯時也。逆魚始成羣而出。逆潮而上。散佈其卵子於溪澗湖澤間。漁人知其性。率就水流急折之處。布網以待。一舉手間。獲可數十。此種活潑之小魚。隨捕隨售。往往出水不及半小時。而已供諸席上矣。故在吳興之逆魚。未有隔宿者。漁人即偶或不能售罄。亦必歸家以享妻子也。</p>
<p>聞諸鄉人談。昔有某宰來宰吳興。見逆魚不識。以爲普通之义條魚耳。後幕僚盛贊其美。因烹之以進。宰嘗之大樂。謂爲生平口福。且詢逆魚不異常魚。何以特美。僚云。普通魚類多順流而泳。惟斯魚獨逆流而上。水逆則勢强。而魚竟甘當其衝。殆受水力之陶冶。因之發育之豐腴鮮美。亦勝於他魚矣。斯說亦近理。因誌之。</p>
<p>吳興有逆魚時期。每歲亦不過數旬。魚以烹後即啖爲最美。越宿常至變味。故用罐頭密封。施諸他魚則可。非所以語於逆魚也。余向寓吳興。備嘗勝味。近年作客遠游。致家鄉美品。無福以快朶頣。誌此誠不禁垂涎三尺也。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二月之十六日。由波羅奈印度學校騎脚踏車往沙拿。即鹿野苑。佛初說法敎五比丘者。余曾數遊。未詳也。今日往遊。此地距市凡五六英里。合華十六七里。出街向西北行。過維多利亞公園。過橋河水淸澈。居民漸少。至一地。上書往沙拿之牌。乃折而東北行。按市政鄉政此牌甚要緊。應於通衢大書之。以便行人。可省問路之煩也。兩旁居民小屋婦女皆紅花穿鼻。人民均甚黑。自此車北行。道路平潔。汽車往來。大樹濃蔭甚可愛。又正北行。乃到沙拿。望見新建之佛敎大學。至其處。則緬僧在焉。二敎師徒八人。正上課。一退休老紳士敎英文。緬僧告我。此爲拉好之律師。年老退休。願在此築屋而居。以終餘年。晚入佛道也。暇則敎少年以科學。且携其許多英印書籍。存於圖書室中。有數子均成名。故不思家矣。余俟其下課。乃邀我在戶外樹下促談。彼在拉好曾聽余講演。現正指揮數僕。蓋屋運木材。依僧而居。因鹿苑地淸矌。多樹木。臨小河。築屋於此甚宜也。中國有多少富人。不知有用其財以自享。此老亦有覺悟也。印度到處太平。築室於道。玩山觀水。足以終矣。徒僧甚喜余至。以牛乳一杯進。彼等將來學成。均須東來中日。重興佛法也。余與印人處。彼此均覺甚親密。彼視中華如其嫡親。中人亦覺印度爲靈性上之母鄉也。其南有一片房屋。余與徒僧觀之。云爲尼乾子敎之公所。房舍堅固。約可百餘間。内有住家。殊欠潔。蓋尼乾子敎至今猶未衰。余在加爾吉打見其新廟殊壯麗。余問徒僧尼乾敎如何。彼云亦算佛敎之一派。惟彼禁穿衣。裸體修持。冬夏不掛寸絲。以抗寒暑。乃其特點。以至飮食不動手。由他人飼之。余聞而大笑。印度無奇不有也。此敎若到西伯利亞。何以堪乎。出尼乾公所西行數十步。有古物院。係英政府所立。樹木整潔。入其中。有多少屋已關門。可看者不少。則畫石佛像也。斷頭缺乏者甚多。有各許佛像。云爲佛過去世之化身。若由此推算過去無量刦。則佛之各種像可充全世界也。余按以佛之智。豈不知石像爲無用贅物。而說造像功德經以聳衆生。歡喜造像。遍於各地。藉此數千年留紀念。以圖再興。畢竟佛之智慧也。因其知一切易壞。惟石刻較可永久耳。然到處身首異處。手足斷缺。分段色身。佛亦無如業何也。亦有克利須那等像。爲印度敎主。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>又歇了一會，子良的鼻子中，嗅到一陣焦味，他暗想：什麽東西燒焦了？</p>
<p>只得推開了窗：</p>
<p>「什麽東西？有焦味了！」</p>
<p>樓下沒有人答應，連竃間裏的娘姨也不響，好奇怪！下面兩個人，什麽地方去了呢？竃間裏的焦味，向上直冲，子良曉得這是把飯燒焦了。一定伊們燒到中途，忽然走開，竃堂裏的柴火不熄，所以那飯都燒焦了。</p>
<p>「下面有人沒有？」</p>
<p>還是沒有人答應，子良一想：只管燒下去，不是要把鍋子都燒穿麽？他一擔心，也不管自已有事，即忙趕下樓去，對客堂中一望，人影也沒有，再想看竃問時，只見後門已經開直了。原來伊們往後門外去了，子良就到後門外一望，見弄堂之中，有人在那裏通陰溝，旁邊有三四個人，立着觀看。果然！自已的賢妻，還有一位寳貝的娘姨，也立在旁邊參觀，子良氣極了：</p>
<p>「通陰溝，有什麽好年看？飯都燒焦了！」</p>
<p>他高聲呌着。</p>
<p>伊們倆一聽，很驚慌的搶着回進後門，子良便在後面跟進來，見娘姨已經過去把燒殘的木柴取出來，月如開了鍋子蓋加水，子良的怒氣，還沒有消滅完結</p>
<p>「通陰溝，沒有看見過麽？連飯燒焦都不管了。」</p>
<p>夫人倒也不肯示弱：</p>
<p>「旣經得飯燒焦了，你也可以過來加加水，熄熄火，怎麽自已不動手，反趕到外面來大驚小怪呢？飯燒焦了，泡起粥來，眞比什麽都香，你不曉得麽？」</p>
<p>「你自已常說的：只要有人肯研究，事無大小，様様都是學問。那末，難道通陰溝不是一種學問麽？」</p>
<p>子良一想：伊們旣經到了竃間裏，就沒有我的事，我自已的工作要緊。他一想定，回身就要上樓。</p>

<p>滬南　昨日各帮來源雖不多、奈城鄉店銷緣天時炎熱、且閘北日疲、進意更呆、去者均抱殺價而已、厚粳續削二三角、中宿胃滯跌去約有四角、薄稻來源亦無幾、甬江帮銷路愈覺不化、本街雖揀高而動、價亦修二尺、杜洋尖高稀形定、中宿乃呆、變陰元鮮高稍化、宿貨仍屬乏交、</p>

<p>北銷仍有···廠少出檔</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份在初盤時、曾見疲軟、因洋麥雖報價回好一二角惟金市開關後、不但無巨大變化、反較前回短六七兩左右、致開價人心頗軟、惟以後北帮仍有吸進、廠家亦無大批出檔、交易雖稀、市氣則呈穩態、較初開計回高一分左右、迨至下午開盤、交易更少、惟以兵船現貨較缺、抽現須加五分、本月份市氣、爲之帶住、遠期因洋麥又有成交、廠家雖未出、人心不免暗淡、觀後步恐以洋麥之故、仍須爲其牽動也、結果較前日好五釐、八月份好五釐、九十月份未動、十一十二月份小二釐半云、</p>
<h3 id="c191">麥市轉好絕望 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>現積甚厚···洋麥訂定···廠抛遠期</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份又一致呈軟疲之象、以金市開價即小、以外匯爲依歸者、至此已經少望、再以事實言、現麥之積存者、本埠已逹十萬左右、廠方均有洋麥、對本麥實少胃口、更傳行家打出之電訊、已經復電證實、澳洲西部之白麥、九月份裝船、又成交七千噸、價祇四兩一錢三分、故向遠期抛出者、數量甚巨、因此各月份均步鬆動、結果本月份較前日小三分、八月份小一分、九月份小二分、十月份小五分、十一月份小三分、十二月份小一分、現麥市况、廠方均無問訊、市呈鬆軟、祇寗波酒坊辦去安亭南京六合麥一千餘包云、</p>

<p>金山枝今庚新貨歉收、地價因之高昂、昨據廣帮電訉、辦價須九十元、故各號尙在觀望、迄未入手、而銷方當然嫌昂　大約擬先辦小數試市、以免虧耗如不能合銷、則擯持之後、地價或可轉鬆耳、</p>

<p>因氣候奇熱······絲織廠停工</p>
<p>紐約向爲銷費生絲最巨之區、詎入夏後、絲銷久無起色、最近竟趨停滯、本埠華絲商分電紐約查詢、茲據絲業公會電告、紐約近一星期中氣候奇熱、各絲織廠宣告停工、生絲市塲廠銷不動、故滬埠華絲去電類均不轉、里昂英倫絲電亦鮮轉滬、昨祇開利進滬白廠經十包、信孚進川黄廠經六包、克昌進黄組絲五包、價尙平定云、</p>

<p>絲産奇歉···夏蠶汎又不佳···到貨不旺</p>
<p>海寗素爲産綢區域、絲織廠林立、土絲消費激増、今歲春　歉收、土絲産額大减、絲行已開秤旬餘、市上到絲不旺、綢廠竸進原料、供不敷求、絲價步漲、高等細絲每百兩已開六十八至七十元、肥五絲十八九元、又各漲起四五元云、</p>

<p>昨日來路莊之針眉綠茶、英莊協和錦隆源生等行及華茶公司、均起搜辦、交易轉暢、惟售盤較前見低五六兩、貢熙一項、白頭莊謙義瑞昌等行、亦均有零星進胃、市盤無變動、惟最關重要之珍眉綠茶、市面益趨沉靜、昨市僅抽芯貨、略有去路、其餘均無交易云、</p>

<p>毛貨呢絨生意、日來可稻落令檔口、各種夏白貨除本街洋服帮略有點缀外、其餘一無問津、大多數俱爲拆疋開剪零星生意、白嗶嘰·白直貢·羽紗呢·巴勒呢·紗斜·告布·黄斜紋等、續有需要、但進胃則不多、蓋爲時已晚、大半意思均願脫銷已貨之故耳、昨寗豐絲搶條子巴勒呢售三兩五錢半、素生三兩、三井絲條售三兩六錢、白嗶嘰爲四兩、白直貢四兩五錢半、</p>

<p>本廠棉布　市面漲後復軟、良以海外花市不振、金價難漲、所以人心散闌、但細布現貨甚缺、故未下落、怡和之金三塔漂布亦挺、昨售開九兩六錢、細斜自開貨者團結以來、貨價頗能站定、尤以藍雙魚絲毫不肯鬆動、一時見缺之萬年靑細布已陸續到滬、開九兩、粗布中九磅十一磅貨均略下落、十三磅平定、十六磅走勢亦不若以前之暢逹、本廠絨布去路亦已呈告一段落之勢、</p>
<p>東西疋頭　市况大勢略跌、就中以東貨之月華絨直貢呢等品較軟、實以七月份貨已陸續到滬、兼之自金市下落後、稅餉定價均較前爲小所以俱思脫手、漂布亦軟、鵲橋會爲十二兩五錢半、三市十一兩九錢、天賜黄金十兩零四錢、福壽三星十一兩一錢半、獨花布仍硬、無論淺色深色及綸昌貨一致須五兩出關、元洋紗連日炎熱後、走銷大暢、每日走去有四五十件、點秋香爲十兩零一錢、小美人十一兩九錢半、寒山寺九兩七錢云、</p>

<p>花園鉛絲有到價跌</p>
<p>英馬口鐵　自外匯趨鬆後、標準首受影響、售盤絡繹下降、每箱祇售十五兩、近幾日來海外定價已見增加、而本埠生意亦甚活潑、故開出有八九百箱之多、行情每箱復回至十五兩四五錢、一百磅貨亦高至十六兩五錢云、</p>
<p>花園鉛絲　前因貨缺、標準飛騰、每扎漲至五兩半、所以一般同業紛紛向東洋購定、近數日來續有到貨、而東匯又跌、所以成本低廉、各同業均抱脫貨主義、以致行情每况愈下、計每扎祇售四兩七錢半云、</p>

<h3 id="e4">Two Cases of Impeachment by the Control Yuan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Li Muqing and Yan Er'ai</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shao Hongji and other members of the Control Yuan submitted a report stating that Li Muqing, the director of the Henan Special Tax Bureau, had publicly posted notices in Gong, Deng, Yan, and other places in Henan, openly promoting the trafficking and consumption of opium and neglecting the prohibition of opium, which is illegal and harmful to the people. The Yuan has submitted this report to the National Government, requesting that it be handed over for disciplinary action. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu E-qing and other members of the Control Yuan have specifically impeached Yan Er'ai, an inspector in Gansu, for providing false reports after inspection and accepting bribes. The investigation results from Liu San and others of the Yuan show that Ma Tingxian had entrenched himself in Gansu, committing indiscriminate slaughter, a notorious crime known throughout the country. The government could not bear to stand idly by and sent Yan Er'ai to Gansu to inspect the original case and obtain the true picture to save the people of Gansu from fire and water. However, his telegram reports were the opposite, praising Ma Tingxian's strict military discipline and willingness to accept good advice, without mentioning his years of slaughter. Although there is no clear evidence of bribery, his protection of bandits and evil deeds is undeniable. The Control Yuan has submitted an impeachment to the National Government, requesting immediate disciplinary action. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Concerns about Future Contract Disputes</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British and Japanese sugar merchants were very surprised at the establishment of the Sino-Brazilian sugar refinery loan. They said that Taikoo Sugar and Taiwan Sugar have always been dumping sugar in China, and this is a major blow to them. They have consulted with the Cuban Ministry of Commerce to participate in the investment because the Cuban Chavino Company is essentially an international sugar company. There may be disputes about the future of this contract. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Troops Strictly Guard Against Communist Activities</p>
<p>(Peiping) A visitor from Shunde said that the Pinghan Railway line is extremely peaceful. There are no troop movements in Shunde. The outdoor drills, sentry duty, and roadblocks are routine for troops stationed in the area and are not surprising. Shi Yousan's troops are stationed in Shunde, Shahe, Renqiu, Nanhe, and other counties and have a very good relationship with the Northeastern Army. It was recently rumored that a large number of communists were discovered in Daming, colluding with local bandits, intending to cause trouble. The troops have a responsibility to protect the area. To prevent any eventuality, both sides have made preparations. The Northeastern Army posts sentries every night more than 20 or 30 li away. Shi's army posts sentries every night to Qizhou, strictly checking travelers and postal services. Passengers passing through Shunde who stay in hotels for two days must find reliable shopkeepers as guarantors, otherwise they will be expelled. Those with suspicious behavior will be arrested, and those found with dangerous items will be executed on the spot. Therefore, arrests and executions are common. As a result, the communists have now disappeared, and public order is exceptionally peaceful. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Using Machine Guns to Fire</p>
<p>Killing More Than Ten of Our Farmers and Police</p>
<p>(Jilin) In Changchun, Korean residents forcibly dug up rice paddies in Wanbaoshan. When this was ineffective, Japanese police continued to assist them. On the morning of the 2nd, our farmers automatically filled in the ditches and were shot at. After resisting in self-defense, more than ten people were arrested. The Japanese army stationed in Changchun immediately mobilized and sent more armed police, declaring that they would use force to conquer our side. There are also reports that they secretly provided firearms to Korean residents, inciting riots. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) In the Wanbaoshan incident in Changchun, Japanese military police surrounded our farmers and police on the afternoon of the 2nd, ordering Korean residents to dig canals and build dams. Our farmers resisted, and the Japanese side fired machine guns, killing more than ten farmers and two police officers. Our people did not back down, and the Japanese increased the number of military police coming to forcibly drive the farmers out several miles away. The Changchun County Magistrate and the City Director went to mediate that night, ordering the people to be patient temporarily and await official handling. Currently, Japanese military police are still protecting Korean residents with weapons as they dig canals. The Changchun County Magistrate and the City Director have telegraphed the provincial government for instructions. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The situation in the Wanbaoshan rice cultivation case involving Korean residents in Changchun is escalating. Korean residents are forcibly building and digging canals, while the county residents are gathering crowds to fill them in. On the morning of the 2nd, 60 members of the Japanese garrison and armed police rushed to the scene with machine guns to protect the Korean residents' work. The Changchun County Government Police also went to protect them. There was a report of a conflict on the evening of the 2nd, but the details are unknown. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Understanding Youth <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>In a previous commentary, "The Way Out for Youth," this reporter lamented that inertia and following the beaten path are the main reasons why today's youth are at a loss. I hoped to spur the youth to develop their abilities and seek ways out for themselves and society through creation. Now, I would like to say a few more words to those in society who are responsible for leading the youth. I do not dare to be garrulous, but I do have facts to support my claims. When people today talk about youth, they frown and sigh, overcome with pessimism. Some say that youth like to make trouble, some say that youth are deteriorating, some say that youth are frivolous, and some say that there are no talented people among the youth. There is no point in talking to those who self-deprecate, and there is no point in working for those who give up on themselves. The fact that today's youth have no way out is all of their own making. From their perspective, this seems reasonable. But if we investigate the root cause of this phenomenon, we will find that this kind of argument is like throwing someone into the water and further weighing them down with a stone. What crime have the youth committed to deserve such a great injustice? Youth are the vitality of a nation and the bridge for society to carry on the past and usher in the future. The quality of today's youth is directly related to the rise and fall of the nation in the future. This is of utmost importance. Therefore, if we merely blame and dislike the youth today without actively helping them, we will only exacerbate the crisis of the nation and society's future. What we should be deeply reflecting on today is: First, is education truly fulfilling its mission and developing its functions? Second, does the social reality give the youth a good impression? Third, have those of us who are responsible for leading the youth truly fulfilled our responsibility to lead? If education cannot guide the youth onto the right path, if society cannot provide the youth with a good environment, and if those responsible for leading the youth cannot patiently guide and correct the youth's mistakes, and even build high walls to separate the youth from thousands of miles away, how can we expect youth, whose minds are not yet set and who have no experience, to not go astray or become negative when they enter society and immediately find themselves at a loss and tempted by various probing hands? This reporter dares to sincerely implore those in the world who blame the youth to first guide the youth, and those who dislike the youth to first understand the youth.</p>

<p>(Peiping) The Hebei Anti-Production and Sales Tax Petition Delegation publicly elected representatives such as Chen Chuxiang to express condolences for Zhang Xueliang's illness and submit a petition. Shao Hongji gave a speech at a welcome meeting at the Chamber of Commerce today, saying that the production and sales tax is ten to twenty times harsher than the likin tax. Since this tax has not been publicly announced by the central government, and the National Government is a revolutionary government that relieves the people's suffering, it resolutely abolished the likin tax, fearing that the provinces would outwardly comply but inwardly oppose it, so it charged the Control Yuan with paying attention. Vice-Commander Zhang supports unification and cares for the people. If he understands the harm this tax is causing to the people, he will definitely be willing to abolish it. Now that the country is unified, no other province has this tax. Why does Hebei have it alone? Is this intended to undermine unification? Therefore, opposing the production and sales tax is supporting unification. The Control Yuan can only impeach; the power to abolish lies with the central government. Whether we can abolish this tax depends on whether we can decide for ourselves. I hope everyone will work together and fight to the end. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - The French and American representatives exchanged opinions repeatedly today regarding the reservations proposed by France. According to news from London, the British government hopes very much that the discussions in Paris will succeed, but if it cannot be resolved for the time being, the British government, in order to promote an agreement and avoid delaying the date, is willing to convene a conference of representatives of the countries concerned. According to news from Paris, the British proposal is welcomed by the French government, but the French parliament is still in session, and French cabinet members are restricted by their duties and cannot go to London this week. Therefore, the British proposal has been shelved, and it is hoped that the French-American negotiations will resume and make progress, so that the British proposal will not need to be reconsidered. The French cabinet met today to consider the latest communication from the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 2nd - It is learned that France has rejected the British proposal to hold a conference of representatives of the countries that signed the Young Plan in London. France has requested that the conference be convened in Paris. This issue is currently being discussed in diplomatic circles. The United States is not a signatory to the Young Plan. If the terms of the Young Plan need to be changed due to France's conditional acceptance of the Hoover proposal, the consent of the signatories must be obtained. However, according to recent news, it may not be necessary to hold a meeting in London. A solution between France and the United States can be obtained in Paris.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 2nd - The French-American negotiations were originally scheduled to resume at 9:30 tonight, but after discussions between the French Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance, they have been postponed until tomorrow morning. Because France still needs to ask for explanations on some parts of President Hoover's memorandum, President Hoover's memorandum was submitted for discussion at today's French cabinet meeting. It was believed that the memorandum had made sufficient progress and could allow the French-American negotiations to continue. This afternoon, French Finance Minister Flandin also visited US Treasury Secretary Mellon and US Ambassador Edge at the US Embassy for a long talk. It is said that the discussion concerned the results of the British convening of a conference of signatories to the Young Plan.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 2nd - The negotiations between the US and France on the Hoover plan have been postponed again today until tomorrow morning. The stated reason is to allow both sides to have an opportunity to reconsider, so as to prepare for a method of rapid resolution. According to reports, today's postponement was proposed by US Treasury Secretary Mellon. This afternoon, Mellon had a conversation with French Finance Minister Flandin, and Flandin requested the postponement of the meeting. However, on the other hand, it is said that the result of the French cabinet's discussion is that the French cabinet's current policy must be greatly changed, otherwise it will inevitably suffer irreparable damage to its reputation. To what extent the current policy will be changed cannot be determined at present. There are those who say that France has decided to abandon its original reservations and will unconditionally accept the Hoover plan as a whole. This statement has been strongly denied by official circles. If this matter is true, then Mellon would have no need to request a postponement. In other words, the rift between the US and France is being actively repaired by both sides. It is the general opinion that the two sides will be able to reach an agreement by Sunday at the latest. However, the French press is still advocating against the Hoover plan, saying that if the Laval cabinet is caught in the trap of the Americans, it will be tantamount to cutting itself off from the people. According to outside reports, Britain has been very active behind the scenes in recent days. Yesterday, the British Ambassador to Paris, Lord Tyrell, sent a construction to the French Foreign Ministry, aiming to eliminate one of the main difficulties in Franco-American coordination, namely, if Germany announces or is allowed to suspend reparations, France must deposit £25 million of British gold into the International Bank. The British government now declares that if the US and France can agree on other points, Britain is willing to assume this obligation for France. It is also heard that Britain is now proposing to convene a conference of creditor nations in Paris, which Washington does not approve of, because speed is essential, and any delay will inevitably lead to changes.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd - Acting Secretary of State Castle told people today that the atmosphere of the Paris negotiations is still good, and he is very optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 2nd - It was announced today that the gold reserves of the Bank of France are 56,425,623,386 francs, a decrease of 99,636,380 francs from a week ago. This is the second largest decrease in two years. According to financiers, this is mostly due to the lack of progress in the Franco-American negotiations on the suspension of war debts, which has led to instability. France and the United States are currently the countries with the most gold reserves in the world, so the amount of gold reserves in the Bank of France is of greatest concern to the world.</p>
<p>Dentsu, New York, 2nd - The New York stock market today was volatile, and the trend of each stock was weak. Its idle state is unprecedented in five years. The reason for the market's unease is due to the lack of progress in the negotiations between the US and France on the war debt suspension case. Although there were occasional rebounds in each stock, they were ultimately suppressed by the general market trend and the sell-offs, and closed at lower prices. However, the declines were not very large, mostly one dollar or several cents. The trading volume was only 1.3 million shares.</p>

The Senate, following the example of the House of Representatives, accepted the proposal for battleships only in principle, and will decide after the government reports what type of warship is most suitable to counter the German battleship Deutschland. The French Minister of the Navy stated that he proposed that Germany should hand over two Deutschland-class warships to pay off reparations, so as to avoid an arms race.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 2nd - Today, police officers and the army and navy escorted American aviators Poust and Gatti in a triumphal parade. The places they passed were crowded with viewers, no less than a million people, vying to throw paper to welcome them. Although the two men had slept for 24 hours after landing, they still felt tired. At night, the police guarded outside their bedrooms, fearing that well-wishers would enter and disturb them. The arrangements for welcoming the aviators at the airfield yesterday were not thorough enough and were criticized by people. It is reported that when the crowd rushed in, the police waved their batons and beat them indiscriminately, causing serious injuries to more than a dozen people, including a newspaper photographer and an important employee of an airline.</p>

<p>Proposal Content Key Points Purpose</p>
<p>Based on the rights seized under the China-Japan Treaty and Agreement (1) Loot the resources and specialties of northern Manchuria; (2) (1) Request the construction of (1) Changchun-Dalai Line, (2) Jilin- (2) A. Prevent the construction of my country's eastern trunk line, B. is the center of gravity for Japan's military defense, C.

<p>Level Question The railway between Tongliao and Taonan</p>
<p>In an area Require my railway freight rates to be completely consistent with the freight rates of the South Manchuria Railway. The basis is a certain unit for agreement with freight rates for each ton per mile. After the distance is agreed, my country's railways cannot compete with the Manchuria Railway.</p>

<p>Ten thousand yuan with an annual interest rate of 9% compound interest</p>
<p>Based on the table above. Even without adding a single word of comment. Its harm is enough to make us shudder. As for what the Japanese are racking their brains to think about. I don't know what it will be like. Negotiations are still not officially agreed upon. On March 6, Mr. Gao Jiyi, our representative, had an informal conversation with Kimura of Japan. Each expressed their opinions. After Kimura raised the above four questions. (The newspaper only published the proposal. The details are unknown.) Mr. Gao replied that the former two items were not within the authority he could discuss. He could only discuss the practical problems of the railway in his capacity as the railway authority. That is the third and fourth items. The Japanese side may wish to state their opinions. It can be forwarded to the Ministry of Railways and senior authorities. After one conversation. It has not officially started so far. Roughly both sides are making full preparations. To weigh and compromise when formally agreeing. Before a formal agreement is reached. Actual situation. It is difficult for outsiders to find out. However, according to Gao Jiyi's conversation with Kimura, he has a true understanding of the issue of authority. The intentions are fine. The passive restrictions. It may not be possible to prevent the Japanese from displaying their ghostly tricks. International negotiations. The attitude and words of the host. All are extremely important. Avoid vagueness and perfunctoriness. But also cannot be outside the scope of authority. If there are any words and deeds. The interests of a country. All are controlled by three or two representatives. A word is lost. It is enough to cast a mistake in Kyushu. We only think that not long ago. The event of overstepping authority in the Bo Li conference and signing a treaty. There is still pain left. Therefore, we must hope that the gentlemen who are our representatives in this negotiation will pay serious attention to this point. In short, from Guangxu 31st year to the present 25 years of Sino-Japanese railway negotiations. Each time our country is in a position of failure. Each time he was subdued by the threats and temptations of the Japanese. Past diplomatic achievements. All are the sad materials of today. That is also the reason why Northeast Railway is restricted today. This time the Japanese use absolute ambition. Consistent policy and precise consideration. Full preparation. Plan to make a negotiation once and for all. Must make my three provinces in Northeast China into their net of heaven and earth and there is no escape. It even shows that "using necessary means" and "decisively deploying and launching" its tough attitude. It can be imagined. The difficulty of negotiation. It is not difficult to predict. The responsibilities of our representatives. Even more due to the severity of the environment and increase. The past twenty-five years have deeply impressed us with the shame of a weak country having no diplomacy. And the heavy burden of shackles and fetters, I hope that future negotiations. Can open a new era. If this time the Japanese are based on the standpoint of friendship, peace, coexistence and co-prosperity, and negotiate in good faith on the practical issues of railways in both countries. We are also willing to negotiate in good faith. Otherwise, let the meeting not be held and the negotiation will not succeed. Disperse with no results. Absolutely cannot accommodate perfunctorily and perfunctorily. Making my Northeast Railway, Northeast three provinces and even my country in a position of never recovering. The responsibility of the representatives is becoming heavier and we feel even more惕惕危惧. Quietly worried. Can't help but. The past cannot be諫, the future is still 可追. We should carefully拭目 and wait for the goodness of this negotiation. Although. The key to the failure and victory of an international negotiation. It lies not only in a few representatives. It is actually tied to whether the nation can unite as one. In this railway negotiation. The Japanese government, the public, individuals and groups. Extensive publicity. Actively advocate. The enthusiasm for this matter. Almost like crazy like crazy. On the other hand, in our country, in addition to the Liaoning Diplomatic Association. Joint meeting of various groups in Shenyang. The League of Jilin Academia organized the Sino-Japanese Railway Negotiations Support Association. Tianjin Support Association for Diplomacy against Japan. And a few groups at Nankai University took organized action. Declare protesting against Japanese aggression. And urged our representatives, other places almost have no response. The invasion of my northeast by the Japanese. Not a local problem in the Northeast. It is related to the survival of my entire country and nation. In the past, the people of the country ignored foreign affairs. Creating today's crisis in the Northeast. After this, the indifferent and careless attitude of the great power 詎容再有. The earth sinks and everything perishes together. The Japanese orbit winding and crossing between the white mountains and black waters on this day. It is the throat of my country that leads me to my death. If the people of the country do not wake up again. When to wait. When the country is in trouble. What cannot be abandoned. Unite as one. Seek the victory of this negotiation together. It is also the prelude to preparing to recover Lushun and the South Manchuria Railway. Otherwise, shouting empty slogans. Ning Fei is in vain. In particular, there are those who advance. The 1898 Lease Treaty of Lushun has long expired. The South Manchuria branch line of a part of the Chinese Eastern Railway. It will also expire next year. Although the Japanese forced my country to recognize 21 articles by threatening means in the fourth year of the Republic of China. Regarding Lushun and the South Manchuria Railway, the terms were extended to ninety-nine years. However, this kind of unilaterally oppressive treaty. My country has fundamentally denied it long ago. Absolutely cannot be taken as the basis. At this time, my government and the people of the country should also prepare as early as possible for the recovery and the redemption of the South Manchuria Railway problem, so as to have the spirit of Ning Wei 玉碎. Do not give瓦全 to seek the recovery of sovereignty. Viewing the results of this negotiation. That is to say, it can be a prediction for next year's negotiations on the recovery of sovereignty. The key is important. The time is critical and the situation is pressing. The author dares to use this article as a document of national emergency for the people of the country. As for the crisis of the Northeast Railway. Leisurely when writing another article. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e66">Changes After the Sino-Russian Conference <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Russia Proposes Abolishing the Board of Directors and Supervisory Board and Increasing the Authority of the Director-General</p>
<p>The Issue of Road Redemption Will Be Discussed Based on Previously Agreed Principles</p>
<p>Mo Dehui Presents Four Counter-Proposals – Harbin Correspondence: Since the seventh meeting, the Sino-Soviet conference has shifted its focus from the issue of road redemption to changes in the current system of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER). However, at the eighth meeting, Karakhan proposed changing the CER's management rules, increasing the authority of the director-general, and abolishing the railway board of directors. A fierce debate erupted during the meeting, and no resolution was reached. The eighth meeting was originally scheduled for June 16, but Karakhan suddenly claimed he had to host a diplomatic corps that day and requested a postponement. The eighth meeting took place on June 21. According to the official gazette published by the Moscow delegation, only a few words were mentioned, simply stating that the meeting took place as scheduled. The ninth meeting was convened on June 24. The official news received still stopped there. Whether there were disputes in the two meetings and how the negotiations on the road redemption issue ended remained unmentioned. The Liaoning National Diplomacy Association believed that the diplomatic situation was changing so drastically during this tense meeting that, although Mo Dehui did not report to Shenyang, the external affairs department should have received telegrams. The people of the Northeast were most concerned about the Sino-Soviet conference, so they telegraphed Beijing a few days ago, requesting a detailed response from the external affairs department so that it could be conveyed to the public. According to a fast letter from Moscow on the 24th obtained from a certain party here, the truth of the meeting was that the representatives of both sides agreed at the eighth meeting to temporarily suspend discussions on the road redemption issue. All previously agreed matters would be handed over to the plenipotentiary representatives of both sides for signing after special committees had organized them, and this would serve as the principle for future discussions. Mo Dehui immediately proposed counter-proposals to Karakhan's proposal to change the current rules of the CER and abolish the board of directors, which were divided into four items: (1) changes to the organization of the CER administration; (2) equal employment of Chinese and Russian personnel; (3) equal deposit of railway funds in Chinese and Russian banks; and (4) simultaneous use of Chinese and Russian languages. These items had not been resolved by the CER board of directors over the years and had become disputes, or even if they had been resolved, there were still problems. The Russian plenipotentiary did not agree with these counter-proposals and responded item by item when the ninth meeting was convened, refuting almost everything. Their claim was still that the CER's business was declining, and its income was insufficient to maintain operations. Abolishing the board of directors and supervisory board would reduce disputes and save money. They argued that the director-general's authority was increased in name only and was still subject to the supervision of the Chinese superintendent. Important matters were still decided by meetings, only merging the powers of the board of directors and supervisory board into the railway administration. Senior Chinese officials still had the right to speak and make suggestions. Mo Dehui replied that the CER was a Sino-Russian joint venture, and the board of directors was a legislative body. All railway regulations originated from it. The railway administration was an executive body. The board of directors was like the shareholders, and the director-general was the hired manager. Without a board of directors, the company would have no shareholders. If the manager acted arbitrarily and held great power, who could come out to restrain them when things got out of hand, and who would have the right to restrain them? Karakhan also refuted Mo with sophistry. How things will proceed in the future will have to wait for the tenth meeting to discuss. The current system of the CER is based on the organization of the Fengtian-Russian and Sino-Russian internal agreements. However, only 40 to 50 percent of what is contained in the agreement has been realized. For example, equal employment and the simultaneous use of Chinese and Russian languages were stipulated early in the agreement, but they have not been realized in practice. This time, Russia's proposal to change the management rules is intended to overturn the Fengtian-Russian and Sino-Russian agreements, and their intention is very dangerous. It goes without saying. The Russian side has always had a strong influence on the management rules and the director-general's authority of the CER. How did the CER war of the 18th year of the Republic of China start? The Chinese people have not forgotten it. Since the signing of the Khabarovsk Record, Russia has used the remaining power of the victor to manipulate railway affairs with its great power, disregard the Chinese side, and act arbitrarily, even more so than before. The Chinese staff serving in the railway, for the sake of keeping their rubles and their positions, competed to make concessions in everything, taking irresponsibility and avoiding Russian dissatisfaction as virtues. As a result, Russian influence increased day by day, while the status of Chinese staff decreased. "Checking in and receiving salary" is a common term used by Russian staff to describe the Chinese side. Without fundamentally improving the organizational and management laws, the power of the Chinese side will become increasingly threatened. We deeply hope that the Russian meeting will discuss this matter. However, the starting points are the same, but the destinations are different. What we earnestly hope for is the full implementation of the Sino-Russian and Fengtian-Russian agreements. What Russia hopes for is to overturn the agreements, abolish the board of directors and supervisory board, and increase the power of the director-general. The prices are vastly different, so it is clear that a conclusion cannot be reached in a short period of time. (29th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Victory in the Suppression of Communists by Various Divisions and Brigades in Fujian <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Customs Collects Bandit Suppression Fees on Behalf</p>
<p>筹Building an Aircraft Field for Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Regarding the suppression of communists in the upper reaches, Division Commander Liu Heding, in his capacity as the Bandit Suppression Commander of Fujian Province, has led his direct troops and the units under his command to launch attacks on the counties invaded by communist bandits. At the same time, he is also building trenches in the areas of Shunchang, Yangkou, and Yanping to block the bandits. According to daily reports, the bandits in Jiangle, after being suppressed twice by Zhou Zhiqin in Guangming and Shuiji, mostly fled north. Although there are a few remaining bandits in Jianning and Shouning counties that have not retreated, Lin Pingzhou and Qian Yuguang's brigades are being strictly ordered to scout and suppress them. As for the Shaoguang area, the vanguard of Division Commander Liu's troops had already passed Dagan on the 22nd and was advancing towards Shaowu County, and it is estimated that they can reach Changting and Ninghua, etc. Lu's troops have also sent teams to assist in the defense. The provincial government received a telegram from Lu Xinming yesterday, stating that Changting was once invaded by the defeated bandits of Ruijin on the day of Xiaori. Upon hearing the news, the troops returned from Shicheng on Qiaori and fought back bravely. They recovered Changting at noon that day, etc. It can be seen that the communist scourge in northern and western Fujian will soon be quelled.</p>
<p>Regarding the bandit suppression fees, the provincial government previously planned carefully. On the 28th of this month, a special temporary meeting was held. In addition to the measures for establishing the Provincial Prohibited-Smoking Investigation Office, the provincial government wired the central government for interpretation based on the requests from all sectors. (1) The proposal to collect one month's rent from the entire province was decided to be implemented as planned to meet military needs. It is expected to start collecting in early next month. (2) The proposal to have the Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Sandu customs collect bandit suppression fees on behalf was decided to be handed over to the Military Needs Design Committee for proper planning. In Xiamen, the Provincial Steering Committee Chen Lianfang and the two committee members Hong Xiaochun and Chen Ruiqing have negotiated and are now consulting with the tax authorities. In addition, the provincial government and Division Commander Liu believe that aircraft is very important for military operations, and have telegraphed the central government to quickly allocate several seaplanes to the province for use. It is heard that the central government has ordered the Aviation Administration to send Lin Jiatan to Fujian to negotiate the construction of the aircraft field. Lin arrived in the province on the 28th and went to the provincial government at 10:00 a.m. to meet with the committee members to discuss everything. It is heard that this aircraft field is planned to be set up in five locations: one in Fuzhou, two in Funing, three in Longxi, four in Jinjiang, and five in Yanping. (June 30)</p>

All bus routes were suspended for two days, the 24th and 25th, due to the excessive flooding. People used small boats to transport people or goods to and from the streets. Due to the turbulent currents, boats often capsized and people drowned. According to a survey, 5 people drowned in Taipingqiao, 3 people drowned in Chating, 2 people drowned in Jiufuan and Houtian respectively, and 1 person drowned in Nanxin Road, Panlongshe, and Sanbao respectively. Even more houses collapsed.</p>

<p>Latest News Summary</p>
<p>The rice paddies in the southwest were being irrigated and filled, but they were washed away, resulting in extremely heavy losses. The county government, the public security bureau, and various charitable organizations cooked thin congee, guangbing cakes, and bread on the 24th and 25th and transported them to the flooded areas to provide disaster relief to the victims. Women and children in the deepest areas were rescued and housed in temples on higher ground. By the evening of the 25th, the floodwaters began to recede, but the water in the low-lying areas had not completely receded. In the areas where the water had receded, the roads were filled with piles of filth, and the stench was nauseating, which was very detrimental to hygiene. On the afternoon of the 26th, heavy rain started again, and it is feared that the floodwaters that had receded would rise again. (June 26)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Flood on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Traffic Between Xiping and Xuchang Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Due to the rising water level of the Luo River, the tracks and bridges in Mengmiaocun, Yancheng, and Guodian on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway were damaged. Since the 30th of last month, traffic between Ping and Han has not been able to pass directly. After receiving the report, Huang Zhenxing, the chairman of the Pinghan Railway Management Committee, ordered the engineering and mechanical departments to work overtime to repair the damage. The bridges and roads between Mengmiaocun and Yancheng can be repaired in three days, and the bridges and roads between Yancheng and Guodian can be repaired in four days. It may be possible to restore traffic in five days. Guan Xilin, the director of the traffic department of the committee, and Liang Yongzhang, the deputy director, telegraphed the committee on the 2nd regarding the traffic situation, stating, "Regarding the sections at 834 kilometers, which were dug up by the villagers, and 832 kilometers and 0829 meters, where the bridges were submerged by water, causing traffic disruption, we have reported this to you by telegram today. It is now reported that there has been a flash flood between Xiping and Yancheng, and the roadbed has been submerged. On the 30th of last month, the second express train from Hanbei was used as the first express train from Xiping and returned to Hankou. It is also reported that the villagers in the area between Mengmiao and Yancheng continue to dig up the roadbed to release the floodwaters. Currently, the Luo River is flooding, and the water is vast, making it difficult to predict when traffic will be restored. The first express train from Beiping on the 30th was used as the second express train from Xuzhou and returned to Beiping, etc. Therefore, except for ordering the section to temporarily use the first down express train to Xuzhou as the second express train to return, and the second up express train to Zhumadian as the first express train to return, to temporarily maintain passenger transport, we respectfully report this by telegram. Please review and approve." (July 2)</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Consolidation Committee yesterday submitted to the central government again regarding the matter of stopping the establishment of a Prohibited-Smoking Investigation Office, stating, "We have learned from the Changshu County Executive Committee that the Ministry of Finance is establishing a National Prohibited-Smoking Office, with branch offices in each province and investigation offices in each county. We are saddened to hear this. Using prohibition as a means of taxation is enough to fuel the flames of addiction. This is a suicidal policy for the party and the nation. Unless they want to cut themselves off from the public, how can they bear to do this? We urge you again to push the central government to strictly stop this. The salt telegram is extremely urgent and awaits orders." This case was previously submitted by the committee to your council for prohibition, but no reply has been received to date. According to recent newspaper reports, more specific details have been revealed, which has caused even greater confusion across the country. Based on the telegram, we are submitting this document again for your review and approval, and we urge you to quickly stop this to curb the scourge of drugs and to meet the expectations of the people. This is truly a benevolent act. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee (3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Major Scandal in the Wuhu Legal Community <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Lawyers Association Accuses Judges of Malfeasance and Bribery</p>
<p>Lawyers Also Mutually Accuse Each Other of Bribery and Opium Use</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After the incident of the assault on Xu Shaolou, a clerk of the local court, at the Star Film Theater in Wuhu, public opinion outside was in an uproar. Rumors of collusion between judges and lawyers and blatant bribery were also rife. The Lawyers Association believed that the malfeasance and bribery of a few judges in the Wuhu court had become increasingly rampant, and it was difficult to tolerate the undesirable elements in the Lawyers Association who were harming the group. It was necessary to eradicate them. Therefore, it resolutely convened a special general meeting a few days ago and invited Deng Jingluan, the chief prosecutor of the court, to attend and supervise. Evidence was obtained for a total of three cases of accusation against judges and lawyers. (1) In the case of the assault on Xu Shaolou, a clerk of the court, at the Star Film Theater, according to the report of witness Chen Zhiqin, in addition to Xu Shaolou himself receiving 1,000 yuan, lawyers She Honghao and Li Weixin openly colluded with prosecutors Pei Xiyu and Da Shiying, committing malfeasance, extorting money, and seeking bribes, eventually leading to the withdrawal of the arrest warrants for Wang Yaohou and Yu Jiaodan, the managers of the Star Theater. (2) In the cases of opium offenders Peng Binchen and Chen, prosecutors Da and Pei openly solicited bribes, only imposing fines and allowing bail without detention. (3) According to member Liang Zuo's report, prosecutor Da Shiying solicited 300 yuan in bribes in the case of opium offender Han Lantian, and there are sufficient witnesses and video evidence. As a result of the meeting that day, although lawyers She Honghao and Li Weixin repeatedly defended themselves, the public resolution decided to expel them from the association and suspend their business. Regarding the accusations, in addition to sending a letter to the court requesting a reply, separate actions were taken immediately: (1) filing a complaint with the Anhui High Court and requesting a transfer of jurisdiction; (2) submitting a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to suspend prosecutors Pei Xiyu and Da Shiying of the Wuhu Local Court from their duties and hand them over for disciplinary action; and (3) submitting a request to the Control Yuan of the National Government to impeach them according to the law and investigate them for dismissal in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Officials. Zhang Benyi and Huang Jing were designated to draft the respective complaints and accusations on the spot, and President Ge Fenglai was the legal representative of the Lawyers Association to make the accusation. It was like a thunderbolt from the blue, and the people were delighted. Unexpectedly, this morning at dawn, lawyer Huang Jing was arrested. The news spread and caused even more of a sensation. The reason was that the local court suddenly received a complaint from lawyer She Honghao last night (30th), accusing lawyers Zhang Benyi and Huang Jing and Huang's father of using opium. Everyone has the right to report opium use, and the court should accept it. Therefore, this morning, prosecutor Pei Xiyu led eight bailiffs to Huang's law firm to search it, but found nothing. He then took Huang to the court for verification. When they arrived at Zhang Benyi's office, Zhang had already gone to Shanghai for medical treatment the day before due to illness. Only an old opium pipe was found and taken to the court. Before this case broke out, lawyers Cui Xiangjiu and Lü Yiyuan and others had planned to mediate to avoid expansion. After this case occurred, the legal community was greatly shocked, because the case was complex and involved too many people, making it difficult to control. After the court took Huang to the court, it held a court session to interrogate him once. Huang firmly denied having an opium addiction and was willing to stay in the court for a few days to wait for verification. The plaintiff, She Honghao, had a stern attitude and was willing to share a room with Huang to monitor him. If the accusation was false, he was willing to accept the crime of false accusation. The court initially planned to send the two to the county chamber of commerce or the county government to find a house to live together, but as the plaintiff and defendant each disagreed, they changed to living in the lawyers' lounge of the court. What will happen to the case in the future will depend on the results of the verification. However, both the judicial and legal communities believe that this is an unfortunate event. (1st)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Wuhu Rice Industry Strike <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The County Government Mediates, and Business Resumes on the 4th</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Wuhu Guangchao Bang Rice and Grain Transportation Industry Association had a dispute with the rice industry over the issue of collecting rapeseed return fees, which triggered a rice industry strike. The members of the county chamber of commerce have repeatedly invited both parties to mediate, but because each side has taken extreme positions, nearly ten days have passed without a resolution. All industries have been affected, and the livelihood of workers is particularly alarming. County Magistrate Yu Yuying convened dozens of representatives from the transportation industry and the rice industry at the county chamber of commerce at 8:00 p.m. last night to discuss ways to resume business first, and the issues such as the return fee from before will be resolved later. It was finally decided at 10:00 p.m. that business would resume on the 4th. The resolutions are as follows: (1) From now on, the price of rice and miscellaneous grains will be settled on a net basis, and the settlement will be made according to the example of the money houses at 27 lines. In addition to the rice industry deducting commission according to regulations, all legitimate expenses of workers from before (tiē lì huí chóu zhèng gōng hú lì dǎ bó jī fāng kōng bāo xià bāo lì guò zhàn) will be paid by the grain transportation industry instead of the rice dealers. (2) The loading and unloading fees will be handled by the county magistrate's investigation of customs and the yamen. (3) Regarding the above resolution on net plate, three representatives from the transportation industry and the rice industry will convene all workers to negotiate and reach an agreement on the 3rd, and business will be allowed to resume on the 4th. The county government and the public security bureau will each issue announcements to inform the public. (3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Lu Diping Takes Office as Garrison Commander of Nanchang Concurrently <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Instructs Strict Observance of Discipline to Consolidate the Rear</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang, based on various informants' reports that the acting garrison commander Tu Weifan was privately collecting 20,000 yuan in opium taxes every month, packaging and selling opium, and engaging in many illegal activities, dismissed Tu and handed him over to the military law department for custody and interrogation. He also appointed Lu Diping to serve as the garrison commander concurrently. After receiving the order, Lu held a swearing-in ceremony at the provincial government auditorium at 9:00 a.m. on the 1st of this month. General Commander Chiang and hundreds of guests from all walks of life attended. At about 10:00 a.m., the music began, and the meeting was held in accordance with the ritual. Chiang handed the seal of the garrison commander to Lu. After receiving the seal, Lu raised his hand and took the oath. After the oath, Chiang gave a speech, roughly saying that the communist bandits have been disturbing Jiangxi Province in recent years. Because the central government wanted to quell the rebellion, it could not devote its full efforts to eliminate them, resulting in the high flames and pervasive atmosphere of communism. Now that a large army is gathering to carry out a large-scale suppression, Nanchang is an important military and political center, and its importance is great. After I (Chiang referred to himself) came to Jiangxi, I believed that Nanchang should have good discipline and solid security, so that it could be extended to the counties. This time, Chairman Lu has condescended to take this position, and I believe that he will definitely comply with the central government's intentions and achieve the above objectives. Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi, and discipline and security are deeply and greatly related to the future of bandit suppression. Therefore, everyone should abide by discipline and consolidate the rear, so that the front line can safely kill the bandits. The former acting garrison commander Tu Weifan has been dismissed and punished for collecting opium taxes. I hope that all civil and military officials and the public can be disciplined, because strict discipline can defeat the communist bandits and complete our mission. Then, Liu Zhenqun, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Department, and Jiang Ji, a representative of the provincial government, delivered speeches. Finally, Lu gave a reply, roughly saying that Nanchang is the center of the province, and the responsibility of the garrison is very heavy. In the future, he will abide by the instructions of the commander-in-chief, consolidate security, and ensure that the bandit suppression soldiers have no worries. He will strictly observe discipline, and only with strict discipline can the communist bandits be defeated. However, to achieve strict discipline, it must start with oneself and set an example, so as not to leave a bad impression. Moreover, the task of the garrison is even greater than that of the police, and it has the power to supervise citizens and soldiers. On the one hand, it will strictly enforce discipline, and on the other hand, it should treat people peacefully. In particular, it will search for and eliminate all hidden communist bandits, so that the communist bandits have no possibility of activity, and then the task of bandit suppression can be completed. At about 11:00 a.m., the music was played, and the meeting was dismissed. The garrison department has moved into the provincial government office, and personnel in various departments have also been announced. Wang Shihe, the chief of the headquarters guard, is also the director of the inspection office concurrently. (June 1)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Perilous Situation at Zhukou on the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Optimistic Outlook for the Entire River This Year</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: According to the River Conservancy Bureau, the time for the summer floods of the Yellow River is approaching. Liuzhuang in Hebei Province, on the upper reaches, is prone to breaches, causing flooding in the Caozhou area of Shandong Province. Fortunately, the Hebei River Conservancy Bureau has taken notice this year and deployed resources to prevent breaches at Liuzhuang, hopefully avoiding any major issues. However, Zhukou, adjacent to Liuzhuang and within Shandong Province, is facing a dangerous situation due to rising water levels upstream. The upstream section chief has repeatedly telegraphed for urgent assistance. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Conservancy Bureau, has reported to the provincial government and requested 30,000 yuan for flood control, sending personnel to purchase hemp and other materials for emergency repairs. He plans to personally supervise the work at Zhukou in the next three days to prevent a breach. As for the overall situation of the river, thanks to the 200,000 yuan allocated by the provincial government for engineering work in the spring, with sufficient materials, the dikes on the upper, middle, and lower reaches have been repaired. Stone dams have been built at various dangerous points, unlike last year's dilapidated condition. Barring any unexpected major floods, the risk of a breach should be minimal. The River Conservancy Bureau's funding and engineering expenses totaled 480,000 yuan last year (240,000 yuan each), which was quite strained. This year, engineering expenses have increased to 300,000 yuan, which should be sufficient. (1st)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Shandong Silk Merchants Petition for Issuance of Public Bonds <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Assistance Based on Jiangsu and Zhejiang Precedent</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Shandong Department of Agriculture and Mines previously forwarded a request from silk merchants to the Central Executive Yuan, asking for the issuance of 5 million yuan in silk industry bonds, following the precedent of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, to help the industry and maintain Shandong's position in the silk trade. The central government responded by requesting a survey of production volume as a basis for issuing the bonds. The Department of Agriculture and Mines promptly submitted a report stating that the province's annual production was at least 11,000 bales, and proposed a method of extracting an additional 30 yuan per bale as collateral for the bonds, which would generate 330,000 yuan annually, allowing for the collection of 2 million yuan in about six years. This proposal was based on rumors that the central government was willing to issue 2 million yuan. The central government has now sent another letter requesting a detailed survey of the number of silk reeling machines and the customs situation. The Department of Agriculture and Mines is still investigating the number of silk reeling machines but is expected to submit a reply soon. It is reported that most of Shandong's silk is exported through the Donghai, Jiaohai, and Jianghai customs, with only a small amount exported through the Tianjin customs. The Department of Agriculture and Mines has also sent a letter to the Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters, asking them to appeal to the central government on behalf of the province's silk merchants to protect the merchants and the silk industry. It has been found that this year's silk harvest in Shandong is very poor, unable to reach even the minimum annual production of 11,000 bales, and the losses suffered by silk merchants are becoming unbearable. The Department of Agriculture and Mines originally intended to request more than 5 million yuan in public bonds, but based on the current urgent situation, if the central government could issue 2 million yuan, it could temporarily alleviate the immediate crisis.

<h3 id="e76">Jiangsu Province Abolishes Financial Bureaus in Eight Counties <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Estimated Savings of Over 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province's budget for the 19th year had a large deficit due to the actual expenditures exceeding the budget. The estimated budget for the 20th year has a deficit of over 7.7 million yuan. To avoid repeating the mistakes of the previous year, the Department of Finance is further reducing the expenses of various agencies. In addition to the merger of financial bureaus in 17 counties in April of the 19th year, the Department of Finance will abolish the financial bureaus in counties with fewer tax revenues and simpler affairs at the beginning of the 20th year. These counties include Baoshan, Funing, Shuyang, Lishui, Bao'ying, Chuansha, Haimen, and Lianshui. Following the same method as last year, the bureaus will be merged into the county governments and a section will be established, with a subsidy of 200 to 300 yuan. Overall, the annual expenses under the financial bureaus will be reduced by 76,020 yuan, while the annual subsidies to the financial sections in the counties will increase by approximately 24,000 yuan. After offsetting the increase and decrease, the actual reduction is 52,020 yuan, to conserve funds. This plan has been approved by the 410th meeting of the provincial government and instructions have been issued to the affected counties for compliance. (3rd)</p>

<p>Two Murder Cases in Two Days: Maluqiao, along the river, is a popular area for boating. The boatmen, mostly from Shaoxing, reside here. Today, Ma Liansheng and boat partners Wu Xiude and Zhang Changshun had a dispute with Wang Aosheng, a peddler selling pastries, because Ma was demanding payment of a debt. The dispute escalated into a group beating, and Wang Aosheng was severely injured. He was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital for treatment, but unfortunately, he succumbed to his injuries and died. This came to the attention of the deceased's cousin, Wang Baolin, who immediately reported to the Second Police Station to apprehend the perpetrators and seek justice. He also reported to the County Court, and Chief Prosecutor Zhu personally conducted an autopsy. The examination confirmed that the death was caused by the beating, and the death certificate was filled out. The three culprits, Ma Liansheng, Wu Xiude, and Zhang Changshun, were arrested while boating and taken back to the court for interrogation and legal proceedings. Furthermore, in Wulidang Township, five miles outside the North Gate, Chen Laoda married a woman surnamed Mou. Last year, she worked as a wet nurse in Shanghai and returned home. On the 22nd of last month, a man surnamed Jia from Jiangbei suddenly came to visit Chen's wife. The villagers in the area, finding his behavior suspicious, ganged up and beat him, causing him to flee with injuries. On the previous day, the man from Jiangbei returned to the area, pretending to ask a woman to wash clothes. The farmers, who were working in the fields at the time, saw him and became angry, rushing ashore to beat him, striking the back of his head with wooden sticks. He died on the 1st.

<h3 id="e99">Lao University Students' Declaration to Continue Enrollment (Continued) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The school and the students are like a country and its citizens. A country cannot be a country without citizens, and similarly, how can a school be a school without students? Our university once suspended enrollment, and now all the first-term students are graduating this year. Looking at the entire university department, only four classes remain in the three colleges of engineering, agriculture, and social sciences, with just over a hundred students. If enrollment continues to be suspended, how can this be a university? This is the first reason why enrollment cannot be suspended again this year. Currently, China's rural economy is facing a total crisis. Farmers' children cannot afford huge education expenses, and are generally prevented by money from attending school. The revolutionary youths who are out of school can no longer bear to see this. Our university is responsible for cultivating leading talents to implement the Three People's Principles of agriculture and industry, and has established a free education policy. The general poor youth are looking forward to the early enrollment of our university. Therefore, for the sake of expanding the training of revolutionary talents and relieving the poor revolutionary youths who are out of school, this is the second reason why enrollment cannot be suspended again this year. Since our university is a product of a certain era and society, and has the mission of seeking the liberation of the working masses of farmers and workers, then at a time when the national revolutionary atmosphere is low and the farmers, workers, and students are disheartened, it is necessary to actively train leading talents for the farmers' and workers' movement in order to achieve the thorough success of the revolution. Now, repeatedly suspending enrollment is tantamount to expelling revolutionary youths and violating the Three People's Principles of agriculture and industry. Therefore, for the sake of the future development of the revolution, this is the third reason why enrollment cannot be suspended again this year. Furthermore, reorganizing the school and enrolling students do not conflict at all. The so-called reorganization is just to get rid of the old and bring in the new in the school's affairs, and it is by no means to not want students. If there are no students, how can we talk about reorganization? Only enrollment is a practical reorganization. Otherwise, there is only the name of reorganization, but no one knows how to reorganize or how to reorganize. We reorganized last year, reorganized this year, and will reorganize again next year. The future of Lao University is over. Therefore, for the sake of promoting the future of labor education and developing the future of Lao University, this is the fourth reason why enrollment cannot be suspended again this year. In conclusion, at a time when the revolutionary tide is high around the world and the working masses of farmers and workers are in urgent need of liberation, labor education has become a certain educational trend ahead of the times, and the Lao University is in particular urgent need in China. Therefore, enrollment is the life-or-death point of our university. It is necessary in objective fact, and it should also be in subjective principle. We deeply believe that the Ministry of Education must have the determination to develop labor education and the enthusiasm to maintain our university, and will not destroy the existence of our university or have the selfish intention of destroying labor education, and will not bear to make the poor revolutionary youths across the country fall into a state of being out of school, causing the future of the national farmers' and workers' movement to become dim. All the students of the University Department of our university have seen this, so we dare to show our sincerity and respectfully ask the people of the society to understand and help, and even hope that the Ministry of Education will take into account the current facts and adhere to the original intention of loving labor education, and immediately withdraw the order to suspend the enrollment of our university, then our university will be fortunate, the future of labor education will be fortunate, and the poor youth who are out of school across the country will be fortunate!

<p>To Prevent Red Bandits from Mixing into Fujian Province</p>
<p>After the Jiangxi Communists were attacked by the central armies, they are now under a general siege. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the Fujian Provincial Government and the naval authorities, stating that the communist army will launch a large-scale attack soon, and that there is concern that the Red Bandits will flee to the Fujian border. He ordered that strict precautions be taken. The provincial government and the naval authorities agreed to strictly prevent the Red Bandits from mixing into Fujian and implemented inspections. The inspection office organized by the Provincial Maritime Association has notified all Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this city that starting today, all ships traveling from Shanghai to Fujian, the entry of passengers, and their luggage must be strictly inspected. Those whose behavior is suspicious will be immediately detained. In order to avoid delaying the voyage of the ships, the shipping companies have agreed with the inspection office that when Shanghai ships arrive in Minjiang, members of the inspection office will board the ships at the mouth of Minjiang to carry out searches, so that the searches can be completed on board when the ships arrive at Mawei, so as to avoid inspections after arriving at the port, causing various obstacles and disputes. The Fujian authorities have already agreed to this method. Shanghai-Fuzhou ships will be inspected starting today.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Reasons for Stagnation in Shanghai-Fujian Shipping <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Flood Disaster</p>
<p>Since the arrival of Fuzhou liners in Fujian, there have been frequent delays and cancellations. The Sannong Company's Wanxiang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Fuzhou. To understand the reasons for the shipping obstruction, the reporter specifically visited shipowner Mr. Liu to inquire about everything. Only then did they learn of the unprecedented tragedy of the great flood disaster in Fuzhou. Fields and homes were completely submerged, and corpses were exposed. This has also caused significant losses to Shanghai-Fujian shipping. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Nantai Turns into a Marshland Fuzhou's great flood disaster began on June 26th. Continuous heavy rain caused mountain torrents to erupt. The water source flowed from Yanping into the Min River and rushed towards Nantai. Nantai is the most prosperous commercial area in Fuzhou, with many large shops. The sudden flood turned all the streets of Nantai into marshlands. At the height of the flood, the water level was about one zhang [~3 meters], and all the shops and residences were submerged. People escaping from the streets had to navigate in boats. Goods were washed away, houses collapsed, and people were displaced. The magnitude of the loss and the severity of the disaster have been rare in recent years.</p>
<p>Corpses Block the River The Sannong Wanxiang ship, traveling from Shanghai to Fujian, was entering the Min River and arriving at Mawei on the second day of the great flood disaster. Along the way, they saw corpses floating in the Min River, drifting downstream. No one was retrieving and burying them. These corpses were mostly from Nantai and the outside of Fuzhou city who had drowned. They were washed downstream. Along the river, there were also broken goods and materials from collapsed houses. The sight was everywhere.</p>
<p>Customs House Immersed in Water The Min Customs House is located in Haiguan Cheng [Customs Square], which was also flooded. This caused the Customs House buildings to be submerged in water. The lower-level offices had become rivers. Staff members had to move to the top floor. Customs officials and merchants reporting and paying taxes had to arrive by boat. However, due to the flood, the work of the Customs House was almost completely stopped.</p>
<p>Shipping Stopped by the Flood Fuzhou's export goods were usually transported by barge from the city to the pier for loading onto ships. Since the flood disaster occurred, many goods have been washed away or damaged by the water. Those that were not affected by the water were unable to be transported because the Min River was flooded, and barges could not carry cargo. As a result, shipping was suspended for three days, delaying all Shanghai-bound merchant ships. The Wanxiang ship was delayed by more than three days and nights, and other merchant ships were delayed by four or five days. Loading only began at the end of June. However, the incoming cargo had been greatly reduced, and merchants had stopped transporting goods. As a result, the Wanxiang arrived in Shanghai with only 20-30% of its capacity. Mr. Liu also said that when the ship left Fujian, the water had not completely receded. Shanghai's shipments to Fujian would also be severely affected.</p>

<p>Did Not Land at Xiangshan</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Navy Deputy Minister and Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, took the Xin Ning Shao ship to Ningbo at 5 p.m. one day. After arriving in Ningbo on the morning of the 2nd, he transferred to the Yixian warship waiting in Ningbo to go to Xiangshan. At 10 a.m. that morning, after the ship left Ningbo, Mr. Chen suddenly felt unwell, with severe abdominal pain. It was probably due to heatstroke. Therefore, Mr. Chen passed by Xiangshan, only met with Zeng Yiding, commander of the torpedo fleet, and did not go ashore to inspect the naval school. Moreover, the ship lacked medical care, so Mr. Chen stayed there for a short time and then ordered the ship to return to Shanghai. Mr. Chen arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 3rd) morning at 7 a.m. on the Yixian warship and immediately summoned naval hospital medical officers for diagnosis. He is currently staying at the Astor House Hotel on the Bund.</p>

<p>Petitioning the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and Appealing</p>
<p>The Wusong Songyang Telephone Company has been in operation for eight years. Recently, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications suddenly sent personnel to Wusong to inspect all the company's machinery and lines, valuing them at six thousand several hundred yuan, and notified the company to hand them over by a certain date to be run by the government. Upon hearing this news, the merchants, residents, and users in the entire town of Wusong were indignant. Yesterday, dozens of shops in Wusong, including the Wansheng Sauce Garden, jointly signed a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, raising eight reasons for opposition and appealing for fairness so that the company can operate peacefully and maintain the current state of communications.</p>
<h3 id="e118">International Wireless Telegraph Price Reduction <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Implemented from the 10th of this Month</p>
<p>Saigon Communication Realized on the 1st</p>
<p>Reducing Telegraph Fees The International Telecommunications Bureau believes that the price of gold has recently fallen slightly, and the established international wireless telegraph prices should be reduced to benefit business. Therefore, it has formulated new telegraph fees, which will be implemented from the 10th of this month. It is reported that the new price is one-tenth lower than the old price.</p>
<p>Saigon Communication All wireless telegraphs between Shanghai and Saigon have been unilaterally received and sent by the French radio station in Gujiazhai, which exceeded its authority. Now that the French radio station has stopped receiving and sending commercial telegrams, the French side has requested that the bureau communicate directly with Saigon. This has been realized since the 1st. However, this is limited to Shanghai. The rates for other places such as Xiamen are still under discussion. Once resolved, communication with Saigon can also be implemented.</p>
<p>Night Telegraphs Night telegraphs to the United States, the Philippines, and other places have previously been limited to a minimum of 20 words per message. It has now been decided to change this to a minimum of 25 words per message, which will be implemented in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Installing Telephones in the Area of Roads Built Beyond the Boundary <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Talks by Huang Boqiao, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities</p>
<p>The issue of installing telephones in the area of roads built beyond the boundary has not been resolved, and there are doubts from the outside world. Reporters from various newspapers believe that telephone communications are important, so they went to the responsible Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to investigate the truth. According to Director Huang, the city's telephone service is handled by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The telephone company in the concession installed telephones in the area of roads built beyond the boundary based on an attachment to the communication contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the former Shanghai China-Foreign Telephone Company. This contract was signed on December 17th, 1925, for a period of five years, expiring on December 16th, 1930. After the Shanghai Telephone Company acquired the former China-Foreign Telephone Company, it did not express any opinion on the expiring contract. Now that the contract has long expired, the company has no basis for installing telephones in the area of roads built beyond the boundary. The Public Utilities Bureau believes that the area of roads built beyond the boundary belongs to the Chinese area, and the company should not operate beyond the boundary. Now that the basis has been lost, the company naturally cannot install any more telephones in the area of roads built beyond the boundary. Even the existing telephone sets and poles should be completely removed. However, the residents in this area have a great need for telephones. Before the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications can reach this area, it cannot be taken care of. Under appropriate conditions, another good solution will be discussed. Although the city's telephone service is operated by the Ministry of Communications, the municipal government, for the convenience of the citizens, should do its best to assist. Therefore, on the day after the expiration of the aforementioned communication contract, December 17th, 1930, it immediately invited the Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the General Manager of the Shanghai Telephone Company to discuss and orally suggested establishing a temporary contract so that the citizens who already had telephones would not be interrupted and those who did not have them could install them. Afterwards, after several meetings, in order to quickly resolve the issue, it drafted a draft contract on May 22nd, inviting representatives from both parties to the bureau to discuss it. The representative of the Shanghai Telephone Company stated that there were still aspects of the contract conditions that needed to be studied and requested that the draft contract be taken back for study and that opinions be submitted as soon as possible to schedule another meeting for final decision. Only because the Shanghai Telephone Company had not expressed its opinion for a long time had this issue been delayed. The Public Utilities Bureau repeatedly requested the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to urge the company to express its views as soon as possible and practically. Finally, on June 26th and 27th, the Director of the Telephone Bureau and the General Manager of the company came to the bureau to continue the discussion. As a result, all the conditions in the contract were discussed, and only the wording needed to be refined before it could be formally signed. The issue of installing telephones in the area of roads built beyond the boundary will be resolved in the near future.</p>

<p>Holding Grand Celebrations</p>
<p>Today is the 155th anniversary of the United States' declaration of independence. American communities around the world are holding grand celebrations. This year, the American community has already organized a committee for preparations. As this year falls on a Saturday, there will be a two-day holiday, making everyone feel more excited. However, because the US Consulate General building is being renovated, it is temporarily renting the former Kaili Hotel site on Jiangxi Road, which is relatively narrow. Therefore, invitations were not sent out as widely as in previous years. The planned celebration ceremony is as follows: At 8 a.m., the US Marine Corps will assemble at the Racecourse and conduct a review ceremony. The American business community will also participate in the parade. The flag-raising ceremony will be held at the Racecourse immediately after the review ceremony. Because of the parade, speeches and the reading of the Declaration of Independence will be omitted. At noon, US Consul General Cunningham will receive congratulations and entertain guests at the consulate. In the afternoon, the amateur baseball association and the US Marine Corps (i.e., the McLain team) will play a baseball game at the Racecourse. The American Club will also hold a grand celebratory banquet. The Public Concession Police Station, fearing that the parade at the Racecourse and the congratulations at the US Consulate General would cause traffic congestion, has designated parking locations and stipulated that after the parade is over, vehicles traveling west on Nanjing Road must detour via Xizang Road. In addition, when the troops pass Jing'an Temple Road, the southbound vehicles on Park Road and Bubbling Well Road south of the Burkill Road intersection will be temporarily stopped.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Record of the Silk Factory Trade Association Meeting <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Many Objections to the Allocation of Public Bonds</p>
<p>Wage Issue to be Mediated Next Week</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association held its tenth plenary meeting of the trade association yesterday (the 3rd) at 4 p.m. Over 100 representatives of silk factories attended, including Zhu Jing'an, Wu Shenbo, and Sun Rongchang. Chairman Shen Huachen presided over the meeting. The chairman first reported that the Shanghai Municipality is implementing unified weights and measures, and the Social Bureau has been sending personnel to factories and businesses since July 1st to conduct strict inspections. Violators will be punished. Although the foreign silk market uses pounds for the UK and the US and meters for France, the scales used by the factories must be replaced immediately. Those who rent factories should immediately notify the landlord. Those who own their own factories should immediately go to the Social Bureau to apply for new-style scales to ensure uniformity and avoid punishment. Next, he reported on the issue of female workers' wages. Representatives of labor and management were convened twice for mediation. The trade association intended to comply with the Wuxi method of increasing wages to 57 cents, but the workers were not understanding and held different opinions. A mediation meeting must be held next week to resolve the issue. Then, it was discussed that the Ministry of Industry ordered that double-cocoon silk factories not be allowed to enjoy the distribution of silk industry public bonds, and the customs for the export of double-cocoon silk has also stopped collecting special taxes. However, there are only six double-cocoon silk factories in Shanghai, all of which are members of the association, and it is actually difficult for them to make a profit. They should be treated the same as those receiving relief. It was decided that the reasons would be stated at the fifth executive committee meeting of the Silk Industry Public Bond Special Committee today (the 4th) to request the allocation of bond certificates. Next, the issue of the issuance of silk industry public bonds was discussed. Chairman Shen stated that the Ministry of Finance bond certificates could be printed by July 10th and could be issued by the deadline. All members of the trade association should list the amount of silk in stock and the number of machines within three days and register with the association for allocation. The seals of the factory director and the person receiving the bond certificates should also be sent to the association for compilation and reporting to the ministry for the issuance of repayment certificates. Do not delay. As for the 2 million yuan for improved machinery and boiling cocoon machines, bond certificates of 3,000 yuan will be issued for each machine and 2,000 yuan for each black board machine. However, the price of this machinery is quite high, and only 2,000-3,000 yuan is issued per machine, plus the discount on public bonds, it is difficult to cover the cost. If the bond amount of 2 million yuan for the improved machinery is given to the landlord, the same industry members will have worked hard to obtain the issuance of public bonds, while the landlord will sit back and enjoy the benefits, which is difficult for them to accept. At this point, the atmosphere at the meeting became tense, and the representatives opposed it. Later, it was decided that the situation in Shanghai would be presented to the Special Committee for further deliberation. Next, the case of the silkworm seed crackdown was discussed. The representatives present all expressed their opposition to supporting this institution, which is detrimental to the same industry, with public bonds. Finally, the representatives discussed with each other and then adjourned the meeting, which was already past 7 p.m.</p>

<p>Resolved to Start Driving Cars and Not Selling Tickets Today News From New Voice Society The First District Water and Electricity Industry Association of Nanshi, which was formerly the Chinese Business Electricity Workers' Union, requested the Chinese Business Electricity Company to improve treatment in March of this year. The company ignored it. The atmosphere was very tense at the time. Fortunately, the Social Bureau persuaded in many ways. At the end of May, labor and management signed nine articles of agreement on improving treatment at the Social Bureau. There are still two items, workers' housing and distribution of bonuses, which were stated to be renegotiated by labor and management. A dispute was settled. Later, the two sides negotiated several times, and no solution was found for housing and bonuses. The company also recently claimed that the signed agreement must be revised before it can be implemented. The union believed that the company disregarded its reputation and violated the agreement. Last night (the 3rd), an emergency meeting of representatives was called, and it was unanimously decided that the signed agreement could not be revised during its validity period. Starting today, they will implement driving the cars and not selling tickets as the first step of warning, and issue a declaration to notify the trade unions, and send personnel to various places to request assistance. (The declaration is long and omitted)</p>

<p>Making Good Use of Memorial Society Gift Money The Shanghai organizations initiated the 50th anniversary memorial society for Mr. Yu Qiaqing's trip to Shanghai. The society has been preparing for many days. It is learned that those who have a relationship with Mr. Yu have been sending gifts and money, which is quite crowded. Because Mr. Yu had decided in advance to use the gifts and money to establish a larger Sanbei Hospital. Although Sanbei is a vast area, it has no well-equipped hospitals. When fellow villagers encounter illnesses, they are unable to get help. Mr. Yu saw this early on and wanted to initiate it long ago. Therefore, he had already prepared 30,000 yuan and friends raised 20,000 yuan to allocate to the founding expenses, for a total fund of 50,000 yuan. The gifts sent by all circles will also be fully allocated to the hospital's expenses. As for the various expenses for the memorial society preparation, Mr. Yu will be personally responsible for them. On the one hand, the Sanbei Hospital Preparatory Committee is actively proceeding. Therefore, Mr. Yu is not only benefiting his hometown, but also creating benefits for the various groups and relatives who participated in the memorial society.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The National Government Will Reject the Sichuan Public Bonds <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday a letter was sent to the Sichuan Native Place Association</p>
<p>The Sichuan Native Place Association in Shanghai had previously requested the National Government to reject Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui's issuance of post-war public bonds and provincial public bonds. Yesterday, the Secretariat of the National Government sent a letter to the association, which began by stating that they received a document from the Chief Secretary, forwarded by the Chairman, requesting the rejection of Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui's issuance of public bonds under false pretenses, in order to eliminate the source of chaos and alleviate the people's suffering. The directive stated that the matter had been forwarded to the Executive Yuan, and that a letter had been sent to inform them accordingly. At the same time, the association is still paying close attention to this matter. In addition to submitting a petition to the Legislative Yuan to prevent the passage of the two Liu's public bond regulations and sending letters to Dai Jitao and the Sichuan Native Place Association in Beijing to jointly oppose them, they also plan to send representatives to Beijing to petition the national government. The express telegram from the association is recorded below:</p>
<p>To all national agencies, organizations, and newspapers, to all Sichuan agencies, organizations, newspapers, and elders, to all Sichuan native place associations across the country for forwarding to all compatriots abroad, and to all Shanghai-based Sichuan organizations for forwarding to all compatriots in Shanghai: The following is a copy of a petition recently submitted by our association to the National Government: "Petition requesting the rejection of Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui's issuance of public bonds under false pretenses, in order to eliminate the source of chaos in Sichuan and alleviate the people's suffering." According to letters from mass organizations in Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places in Sichuan, Liu Xiang, the Director-General of Post-War Affairs in Sichuan, and Liu Wenhui, the Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, plan to request the Central Government's approval to issue public bonds to fund the civil war. They instructed our association to prevent this from happening in the vicinity. We were surprised and at the same time, we saw reports in newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai stating that Liu Xiang's representatives had requested the issuance of 20 million yuan in Sichuan small post-war public bonds, and the government had forwarded it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. At the same time, Liu Wenhui also requested to follow Liu Xiang's example and issue 20 million yuan in Sichuan provincial public bonds, and the government is also reviewing it. Our association believes that this matter is of great concern to the interests of the people of Sichuan, and it is difficult to remain silent and endure it. Furthermore, since the Central Government has repeatedly declared that it seeks public opinion, we must express our views frankly. Therefore, we respectfully present to your government the absurdity of the two Liu's request to issue public bonds. Sichuan Province has been in a state of chaos in recent years, with over 300,000 troops rampaging and engaged in internal strife. The grain taxes in various places have been pre-collected until the 34th year of the Republic (1945), and each county has one or two dozen types of miscellaneous taxes, with a total of 120 million yuan being extorted each year. Although the Central Government has clearly ordered the abolition of likin and the elimination of excessive taxes, the various military bandits have turned a blind eye and even intensified their efforts. Our poor people rely entirely on traditional agricultural production for their livelihoods, and there is no large-scale industrial and commercial economy to regulate it. They are taking flesh to heal sores and scraping skin to the bone. The people's strength is exhausted, and how can they bear it? In addition, in the past two years, disasters have struck simultaneously. The mountains and rivers of Sichuan are filled with wailing. In the prosperous towns of Sichuan, over 100 well-known businesses have closed down. Rice and grain are in short supply everywhere, and begging for food and transportation has spread throughout the Yangtze River area. Refugee unrest is rampant in various counties, and various forms of disturbances are being carried out by religious bandits and communists. This situation cannot reach the ears of the emperor due to the barrier of the Kui Gate. However, Commissioners Ding Chao-wu and Fang Jue-hui have personally visited the area and can easily prove everything. If, in the midst of this dying population, they are suddenly forced to pay 40 million yuan in public bonds, and there are no wealthy merchants to provide assistance, it will not only leave the majority of disaster victims without any means of survival, but if it creates a red disaster like Jiangxi, who will bear the responsibility? Therefore, we request that your government take into account the suffering of the people and reject it. This is the first reason. The Sichuan region is currently divided among various military forces. In addition to the two Liu's, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou also occupy their own territories and do not yield to each other. Although the two Liu's are in charge of military and political affairs, they only have a Post-War Affairs Directorate and a provincial government. If they truly supported the Central Government and sought to unify Sichuan, our people would be willing to endure and bear these public bonds. However, neither of the two Liu's wants to unify Sichuan. They are preoccupied with seeking the development of their personal power and obtaining more counties and defense areas or more divisions and troops, which is enough to satisfy their desires. The most obvious example is the recent war in northern Sichuan. Li Jiayu was recruited by Liu Xiang, but Liu Wenhui attacked him. Chen Guangzao was recruited by Liu Wenhui, but Liu Xiang attacked him. The two Liu's are clearly taking opposing actions, but in reality, the two are not enemies. Recently, they even met in Chongqing, claiming to be senior officials appointed by the Central Government and jointly seeking to unify Sichuan. They do not hesitate to sacrifice the lives and property of millions of people to provide them with a performance of farcical, contradictory, and confusing internal warfare, which is truly ridiculous. Now they want to issue public bonds under false pretenses to continue expanding their unspeakable internal warfare. In addition to benefiting them personally, the harm to the country and the people is almost indescribable. If your government does not examine the use of the public bonds and approves their issuance, it will be tantamount to fueling the internal chaos in Sichuan, destroying the government's credibility, and placing the 70 million people of Sichuan in a death trap. Therefore, we request that your government take into account the elimination of the chaos in Sichuan and reject it. This is the second reason. The two Liu's occupy the most defense areas in Sichuan. Liu Xiang occupies more than 40 counties, and Liu Wenhui occupies more than 60 counties. The fertile land in southeastern Sichuan is entirely owned by them. Everyone knows the wealth they have accumulated through years of extortion. In addition to opening banks and shops in Chengdu and Chongqing and acquiring vast fields in western Sichuan to build a rich and prosperous foundation for their descendants for generations to come, they are also making every effort to expand their military equipment, establishing arsenals throughout the province and purchasing new weapons from abroad to use as tools to suppress the people. The people of Sichuan are suffering greatly from too many soldiers. The only way to save the people of Sichuan is through demobilization. However, the two Liu's not only do not demobilize a single soldier but continue to increase their numbers. What is the purpose of this? Is it as Chairman Chiang said, that there is no need for demobilization, and that they will be used to undertake national defense and pacify the local areas? However, western Kang has already been conquered, but we have not heard of Liu Wenhui increasing his troops to go to Kang. Western Hubei is on the verge of becoming a bandit area, but we have not seen Liu Xiang sending more troops out of Sichuan. Now, with insatiable greed, they are not satisfied with extorting the people to enrich themselves and hoarding troops for self-defense, and they are still asking the Central Government to explicitly approve the issuance of public bonds to fill their insatiable desires. Their inhumanity has reached this point. Even if they take all the property of the people of Sichuan and offer it to these people, they may still ask the Central Government to bear their military and political expenses. Therefore, we request that your government take into account the punishment of corruption and reject it. This is the third reason. Even if we take a step back and say that the two Liu's public bonds are truly used to handle post-war affairs in Sichuan, we should bear it. However, their claim to use Sichuan's stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol tax to offset the public bond fund is also unreliable. What is the reason? When Sichuan's soldiers raise funds from the people, they are mostly called loans or advances, but the result is always that there is borrowing without repayment and advances without recovery. The facts are all there and can be checked one by one. This time, it is said that stamp, tobacco, and alcohol taxes will be used as collateral, but in fact, the monthly income from all stamp, tobacco, and alcohol taxes in the two Liu's defense areas is only a few hundred thousand yuan. They have claimed to use it as collateral for borrowing from the people countless times. However, although they claim to use it as collateral, they still do not repay the people, and the situation remains the same. Even if they truly respect the Central Government's prestige this time and actually allocate the funds for repayment, it should be known that although this public bond is called a post-war public bond, it is actually Liu Xiang's public bond. Although the provincial public bond is called a provincial public bond, it is actually Liu Wenhui's public bond. In recent years, the troops in Sichuan have been rising and falling, and the defense areas have been changing, with no fixed situation. Once the two Liu's move or fail, their so-called allocation will be completely ineffective. Even if the Central Government has an order to recognize it, what can it do if the local soldiers do not comply? Therefore, we request that your government take into account the maintenance of the public bond's credit and reject it. This is the fourth reason. Sichuan is a province. The so-called post-war affairs should be planned for the overall situation. However, Liu Xiang requested the issuance of a post-war public bond, and Liu Wenhui followed suit and requested the issuance of a provincial public bond. This is tantamount to treating Sichuan as two regions. How can there be any unified thought to speak of? Now, one province is issuing two types of public bonds. If other provinces also use false pretenses and follow suit, I am afraid that all kinds of public bonds will spread throughout the country. The people's strength is limited. How can they bear it? For the time being, we will not discuss whether the Central Government will allow the provinces to follow suit. However, the soldiers in Sichuan other than the two Liu's will definitely follow suit. There is no doubt about it. It is true that Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, etc., do not have legitimate reasons to ask the Central Government to issue public bonds. However, as long as the Central Government approves the issuance by the two Liu's, they can freely do so. We do not know how many more public bonds will appear in Sichuan Province. According to Sichuan's military convention, if Army A draws a certain type of tax, Army B and Army C will certainly draw a certain type of tax, regardless of whether Army A has submitted it to the Central Government for approval. For example, in the past, when Liu Xiang submitted a request to the Central Government to handle special taxes, the various armies also handled special taxes themselves, and the people did not dare to resist. The reason they held was that Army A was raising funds for military expenses, and our army could also raise funds for military expenses. If the people dared to oppose it, they would be accused of resisting the public and being enemies of the people, and they would suffer unforeseen disasters. Therefore, we request that your government take into account the elimination of the abuse of public bonds and reject it. This is the fifth reason. Based on the above five points, in order to protect the glorious history of our party and the National Revolutionary Army, we do not want the troops of Sichuan to stain the pure jade of the National Revolution. In order to respect our homeland and prevent the elders from perishing, we are expressing our views with hair disheveled and hat askew, shedding tears of blood. It is only appropriate to submit our respectful words and earnestly request that your government treat the people as if they were injured, not neglecting those in distant places, and approve the rejection of Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui's request to issue post-war public bonds and provincial public bonds, so that the people of Sichuan can have a way out of the boiling pot and a ray of dawn in the dark world. We offer our most sincere prayers. Sincerely submitted. On the same day, we also sent a telegram to Liu Fucheng, Director-General Liu, and Liu Wenhui, Chairman Liu, which read: "Urgent to Director-General Liu Fucheng in Chongqing and Chairman Liu Zigan: We have repeatedly read reports stating that Director-General Fucheng has requested the Central Government to approve the issuance of 20 million yuan in Sichuan post-war public bonds, which the Central Government has not yet approved. Chairman Zigan has also followed suit and requested the issuance of 20 million yuan in provincial public bonds, which is shocking. At the same time, our association has also received letters from mass organizations in Chengdu and Chongqing and compatriots in Shanghai, requesting our association to forward them to the Central Government to stop it. Our association believes that in recent years, Sichuan Province has been plagued by disasters, and commerce has been in decline, which you are well aware of. If you are truly committed to the revolution, you should find ways to demobilize the troops and appease the survivors in order to save our people from fire and water. However, the Central Government has entrusted you with the important task of saving Sichuan, and we have never heard of any proper ways to unify Sichuan and alleviate the people's suffering. As far as our colleagues know, you are only expanding your personal military power and creating unnecessary internal strife to satisfy your personal desires, even at the expense of prolonging likin and miscellaneous taxes and increasing the local burden to further afflict our people. Our association has received repeated reports from our hometown, urging us to find ways to raise funds, with every word filled with tears, which is unbearable to read. However, considering that the various armies in Sichuan are all birds of a feather, before the Central Government can resolve the situation in Sichuan, even if we cry bitterly in the Qin court, it will ultimately be of no avail. Therefore, we reluctantly listen to it. We did not expect that, in addition to directly exploiting the people, you would turn to borrowing the name of the Central Government as a talisman and issuing tens of millions of public bonds in the form of raising funds. You are also people of Sichuan. Please search your conscience in the quiet of the night and think about the people of Sichuan who are on the verge of death today. What strength do they have to bear this heavy burden? Is it not caring about the lives and deaths of the people? Not only will there be soldiers without people, and no source of military pay, which is not fortunate for your army, but today, the red disaster is rampant, and everywhere is being poisoned by it. If it forces a popular uprising, like the irreparable situation in Jiangxi, how can you escape this heavy blame? Therefore, we cannot help but implore you to consider the suffering of the people and voluntarily withdraw the proposed issuance of public bonds. If you think that the military pay is insufficient, and it is difficult to do so, you may wish to consider the sluggishness of the entire Sichuan and slightly implement a policy of austerity. Or, you can temporarily inject the savings you have accumulated from extortion in the past to allow the people to escape the disaster this year, and then compensate them in the future when they have the strength. It is not impossible. If you must use the two words "post-war affairs" as an excuse, regardless of everything, and insist on plucking all the melons on the Huangtai Melon Vine, then even if the public bonds are issued in the future, there will still be no way to do good afterwards. What face will you have to see the elders of Jiangdong? Not to mention the resentment of the people. Therefore, our association does not avoid offense and sincerely petitions for the people. In a moment of urgency and desperation, we do not choose fine words and speak to each other with tears streaming down our faces. If you also believe that our colleagues are acting out of conscience and do not find loyal advice unpleasant to hear, then please show your respect for our homeland and leave a glimmer of hope for the 70 million people. Not only will our association colleagues be deeply grateful, but we will also send a telegram to inform you. We respectfully hope that you will take it into consideration. These are just some words. The matter concerns the vital interests of 70 million people in Sichuan. Whether directly or indirectly, inside or outside Sichuan, everyone is greatly affected. We hope that everyone will uphold their conscience and work together to liberate themselves, and unanimously request the central government to reject it and urge the two Liu authorities to cancel the proposed plan, unite compatriots inside and outside the province, and oppose it to the death. Do not stop until the goal is achieved. What can we do in the face of the great disaster in the future? Our association is a part of the people of Sichuan and dares not lag behind in loving our homeland and saving it from disaster. We only seek to benefit our elders, and we would not hesitate to do anything to serve them, even if it means wearing out our bodies. However, our strength is weak, and we are afraid that it will not be effective. We cannot help but hope that all parties will pursue and remember the past and work together to overcome difficulties. We respectfully send a telegram to inform you. Please consider it. Sichuan Native Place Association in Shanghai." [Stamped] "Issued from the office at No. 15, Jiujiang Road, Shanghai."</p>

<p>The Manufacturers Association's Request for Assistance</p>
<p>The National Products Department Store case has been going on for almost a month now, and the issue of the store's closure remains unresolved. The court has scheduled a trial for the injured employees. The details of yesterday's situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Assault Lawsuit: Male and female employees of the National Products Department Store were successively and illegally arrested by the police for publishing the department store's daily newspaper. Although they were all released, employees Zhu Qiyong, Huang Xiliang, Zhu Kuiguang, and others were beaten and injured. The department store hired a lawyer to sue the police in the Special District Court. The court has now scheduled the trial for the 6th.</p>
<p>Letters to Chinese Directors: The negotiation committee of the National Products Department Store sent letters to the Chinese directors of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that our department store was illegally closed by the Public Works Department on June 9 and ordered to suspend business. We have heard that the Public Works Department will convene a board meeting on July 1 to discuss the matter. As you are one of the Chinese directors attending the meeting, we would like to know the details of how the case was discussed, your statements at the meeting, and the resolutions made, in order to dispel public doubts."</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Appeal: The National Products Manufacturers Association sent a letter to the national products associations in various provinces and cities yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the National Products Department Store has been illegally closed by the Public Works Department for a long time, and no concrete solution has been found. Although various parties have been consulting recently, the decisions made are mostly for matters that the department store has not yet carried out, and no mention has been made of the losses suffered by the participating manufacturers due to this unfortunate event. It is unknown that the business losses are actually the greatest for the participating manufacturers. We have found that most of the participating manufacturers are members of your association, and you are well aware of all the difficulties. Therefore, for the sake of the common interests of the manufacturers and the future of the National Products Association, we dare not remain silent. In addition to asking the various organizations to uphold justice, we are also attaching the original letter and respectfully request your consideration and assistance in upholding justice and maintaining the industry."</p>

<h3 id="e132">Request to Exempt Completed Consolidated Tax from Business Tax <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Joint Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to Central Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan in Nanjing, stating: "To the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan of the National Government in Nanjing: The Business Tax Law passed by the 145th session of the Legislative Yuan has been promulgated by the National Government. Article 1 states: 'The business tax is a local income. All businesses operating in the cities of each province and the Executive Yuan shall pay business tax, except for factories that pay factory tax to the central government or banks organized as joint-stock companies that pay income tax.' This is clearly to implement a one-tax-per-item system to eliminate the harsh policies of repeated taxation during the likin era. According to the law, the factories mentioned naturally include a group of factories that manufacture goods. For example, cotton textile factories that have completed the consolidated tax on cotton yarn or cotton fabrics directly woven from it, when the goods are moved from the factory to the warehouse for storage, and then from the warehouse to the sales outlet set up by the factory for business, although the goods are moved to three different places, the main body and behavior of the business are still one. The warehouses for storing goods and the sales outlets for selling goods belonging to the factory are all included in the word 'factory' and should be excluded together with the factory. There should be no reason to levy business tax again. However, the officials in various provinces who collect business tax are mostly filled by personnel from the former likin agencies, and they inevitably still hold the views of the likin era. They often distort the clauses, resulting in repeated taxation of one item. The members of our association only know that one tax per item is the principle of the government's tax policy, and they believe that the repeated levying of this business tax is contrary to the original intention of the legislation. Although they have repeatedly and earnestly stated their views, they have not been corrected. The future of national products is chilling. The members are deeply concerned and have successively arrived at the association to request that the central government be requested to recognize that the word 'factory' in the above clauses should be considered to include the warehouses for storing goods and the sales outlets for selling goods belonging to the factory as the same commercial entity and the same business behavior. Issue an order to exempt this repeated business tax in order to relieve the difficulties of merchants and benefit tax revenue. We are extremely eager to await orders."

<p>Rubber, Hardware, and Vehicle Supplies Industry: The Rubber, Hardware, and Vehicle Supplies Industry Association held its 18th executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. All executive committee members were present, and Tu Runcai was publicly elected as chairman to discuss various proposals. (1) Proposal to reorganize the Dunlop tire price: It was resolved that the wholesale price of outer tires should be 21 yuan per pair, and the wholesale price of inner tubes should be 4.80 yuan per pair, effective immediately. If any members violate this, they will be punished in accordance with the public agreement. (2) The preparatory committee for Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 50th anniversary in Shanghai sent a letter requesting the appointment of representatives to participate.

The representative committee and executive committee have been holding meetings to discuss increasing dyeing prices and unifying industry regulations. The full text has been disclosed in cover advertisements in Shen Xin Min and other newspapers and will be implemented on July 1st. All industry members in the city are closely related and strictly adhere to this. However, there are still a few factories that are hesitant and intend to disrupt. The association has repeatedly discussed and developed a comprehensive strategy to deal with dyeing factories that do not join the association and attempt to disrupt the industry. When necessary, it will contact labor and capital groups in the Shanghai dyeing industry to make a final decision.</p>
<p>Candle Industry: The Candle Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that member Sanyangtai has not paid fees since the winter of the 18th year. Although representatives have been sent to collect the fees, they have not been paid. Another member, Lao Taisheng, has also followed suit, repeatedly delaying payment. The association's fee collection standards were previously resolved by the general meeting and approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and various other authorities. All members should pay quarterly according to the standards and should not delay or procrastinate, so that the association's funds will not be depleted and its affairs can be reorganized. Now that these members are so negligent, should the Chamber of Commerce send representatives to supervise the association's staff to persuade them to pay? It is requested that the Chamber of Commerce review and approve this and issue instructions to be followed, which would be in the public interest.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Continued Trial of the "Snow Butterfly" Case <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for 8:00 AM on the 11th</p>
<p>The case involving Hu Die, a female actress from the Star Film Company, and her former fiancé, Lin Xuehuai, regarding the termination of their engagement and the recovery of debts, is being litigated in the Special District Local Court. After two hearings by the Special Court, the case was postponed for three months due to the need to investigate evidence. Once the investigation procedures were completed, both parties were notified, and witnesses were subpoenaed. The hearing was scheduled to continue yesterday morning. Since the case has always been of public concern, after the date of the hearing was announced, those who wanted to witness it firsthand gathered at the Special Court at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Initially, many lingered in the square or inquired at various courtrooms, not knowing where the trial would be held. Men and women crowded together, sweating profusely, but did not mind the hardship, finding it enjoyable instead. It was not until 9:30 AM, when the plaintiff Hu Die and her father, Hu Shaogong, arrived at the court with their representative lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, and went straight to the first courtroom on the third floor, that the crowd realized that the trial would be held there. They immediately swarmed upstairs. At that time, the criminal case in the courtroom had not yet been completed, but the people entering the courtroom continued to pour in, and the noise was particularly loud. The bailiffs stopped them, and order was barely maintained. It was already 10:00 AM when Judge Zhou finished hearing the criminal case and left the courtroom. Soon after, Judge Zhou Daren, who was presiding over the "Snow Butterfly" case, took the bench and first inquired about the subpoenaed witnesses. Only Zhou Jianyun, the business director of the Star Film Company, had arrived. Although Hu Die had previously stated that Anfei Garage and Zhao Huisan were at 49 Avenue Albert in the French Concession, the Special Court sent officials to serve subpoenas, but they could not be found. Therefore, no one arrived yesterday. The defendant, Lin Xuehuai, did not arrive until Judge Zhou took the bench. He was accompanied by his defense lawyers, Eson and Ni Zhengyao. Lin was wearing a flannel suit and sat in the back row of the lawyer's seats. Hu was wearing a white dress with red flowers and sat in the witness stand.</p>
<p>The gazes of the two met, but they seemed to be worlds apart. Judge Zhou then ordered Hu Die to stand in the witness box and asked her to point out the money Lin Xuehuai had borrowed from the check stubs that had been obtained from the Industrial and Commercial Bank. Hu carefully examined each stub and marked with a pencil those that were given to Lin with the character "Lin." There were six stubs in total, amounting to 199 yuan and 2 jiao and 73 taels of silver. Judge Zhou then gave the stubs to Lin to read and asked if he admitted to borrowing the money. According to Lin, although he had borrowed the money by check, he had repaid it one day after it was due. If the plaintiff had indeed lent him the money, she would have a ledger to prove it. He hoped that she would produce the ledger so that they could settle the account. As for the price of the car, he had also repaid it. Lawyer Eson presented the car registration certificate donated to the French Concession. Since Lin denied owing the money, the judge asked Hu Die how she could prove it. Hu stated that, for example, the money for Tang Rongxiang was actually</p>
<p>The price of the suit that Lin paid. As for other debts, at the time, because of their relationship as relatives, it was inconvenient to ask for receipts. Now, he knows that my company has been destroyed by fire and the ledger has been burned, so he is using the ledger as a condition to demand it. The judge then asked if she could not terminate the engagement. Hu replied that the matter had already reached this point, and there was no reason not to terminate the engagement. If they did not terminate the engagement, they would have to get married in the future, and it could be said with certainty that there would be no good outcome. At this point, the judge summoned the witness Zhou Jianyun to inquire about his age and occupation. After he made an affirmation, he testified truthfully. Zhou said that he had known Lin for seven or eight years and Hu for only three or four years. Lin used to be an actor at Star Film Company, and Hu is currently an actress at Star Film Company. I participated when Lin and Hu got engaged. Later, Lin only acted in one film and then left Star Film Company, so they did not often interact. I feel that this pair of</p>
<p>Fiancés had a very good relationship. However, between the autumn and winter of last year, I heard rumors that both sides were dissatisfied. I happened to talk to Hu about it, and Hu expressed her dissatisfaction, saying that Lin was squandering the money she gave him and dancing with other people. I was deeply concerned that their marriage would encounter obstacles, so I advised them as a friend, hoping that they would reconcile. However, although Hu expressed her dissatisfaction, she did not reveal any intention to terminate the engagement. Later, I met Lin, and Lin said that he could not completely trust the reports in the tabloids about Hu's actions, but he could not ignore them either. The two sides became suspicious of each other, which led to the current situation. As for the 600 yuan that Ms. Hu borrowed from Star Film Company, Hu said that it was for Lin</p>
<p>To use for his gold business. Later, when I asked Lin about this, he also denied it. The purchase of the car was also what Hu told people, saying that the price of the car was paid by her. However, Lin did not admit it later. The judge then summoned Lin to ask who initiated the termination of the engagement. Lin still said that it was from Hu, saying that on November 18th of last year, he went to meet with Zhou after Zhou Jianyun summoned him by letter. Zhou told him that Hu had gone to the company with her father and sisters to ask for assistance in terminating the engagement. I asked Zhou to persuade her. The next day, I visited Zhou again, and he said that Hu's intention was firm and could not be reversed. After I (Da Bao) published the news that Hu's behavior was improper and her reputation was tarnished, I tried to persuade her every time I saw her, until after November 15th, when I stopped seeing her. I also sent a letter on November 28th proposing to terminate the engagement. The judge then asked Hu Die what</p>
<p>Were the reasons for requesting the termination of the engagement? Hu said that she had already stated them in her complaint. If we consider the current situation, it is even more difficult to maintain the engagement. The defendant's desire to maintain the engagement is nothing more than to avoid repaying the debt and compensating for the loss. However, since the defendant proposed to terminate the engagement first and clearly stated in the letter that they would break off all relations, how can the engagement be maintained? As for the debt of 185 yuan, 191 taels of silver, the loan of 1,385 yuan, the loan of 600 yuan borrowed from Star Film Company, and the car, which should be returned at the price of 380 taels of silver, in addition to which, a loss of 1,000 yuan should be compensated. This loss is because of the three years of engagement, and he suddenly broke the engagement,</p>
<p>Causing time to be wasted and causing great mental suffering, which should be adequately compensated. Lin then stated that the plaintiff should provide reasons for requesting the termination of the engagement; otherwise, he would not agree. As for the various amounts being pursued, Lin still claimed that they had already been repaid. The judge then ordered the debate to begin. First, the plaintiff's lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, spoke, dividing his statement into two parts: (1) The part about terminating the engagement, stating that the dispute arose because the defendant arbitrarily squandered the plaintiff's money at the dance hall. The plaintiff and her father witnessed and advised him against this, but the defendant became angry and wrote a letter to the plaintiff, proposing to terminate the engagement. The plaintiff still left room for negotiation, replying that she would only accept the proposal under certain conditions. However, the defendant's desire to terminate the engagement was urgent, and he continued to urge her in subsequent letters. This shows that</p>
<p>The defendant took the initiative to terminate the engagement, and the responsibility naturally lies with the defendant. Furthermore, there is another matter that proves this, that is, on the first day of the trial, the defendant published a counterclaim in the newspaper, stating that he wanted to terminate the engagement. Although the counterclaim has not yet been filed, his determination to terminate the engagement has already been exposed. According to Article 976 of the Family Law of the Civil Code, if a major event occurs, one can request the termination of the engagement. The defendant's previous actions can be considered a major event. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit to terminate the engagement and, in accordance with the same law, the non-negligent party can demand compensation for damages from the negligent party. The negligence in this case lies with the defendant, who should naturally be ordered to compensate for the considerable losses in order to compensate the plaintiff</p>
<p>For the mental suffering she endured. (2) As for the debt, Lawyer Zhan stated the reasons for pursuing each amount one by one and requested that the defendant be ordered to repay them all, as well as the statutory interest and litigation costs from the date of the lawsuit until the end of the execution, which should also be borne by the defendant. Next, the defendant's lawyers, Eson and Ni Zhengyao, stood up to respond, first stating that Lin was the owner of a morning tea shop,</p>
<p>And not a jobless person. Next, they said that the plaintiff could only claim for the termination of the engagement and the losses from the termination, as well as the 600 yuan borrowed from Star Film Company, etc. As for the other debts, since the money belonged to Hu Die's company, her father should sue as the plaintiff. Since he did not have his father's legal authorization, he should be rejected according to the law. Finally, they debated the three items that the plaintiff could claim and said that the defendant's letter proposing to terminate the engagement was merely an invitation to offer. Since it was not agreed to by the plaintiff at the time, the letter had already lost its validity and he was not responsible for anything. As for</p>
<p>The losses claimed by the plaintiff, since there was no proof and the evidence for the 600 yuan was insufficient, they should be rejected. Judge Zhou then summoned Hu Shaogong to ask who opened Hu Die's company. Hu said that it was opened jointly by him and his daughter. The father and daughter had also discussed pursuing the debt before filing the lawsuit jointly. The defendant's lawyer then made another defense, and Judge Zhou announced that the debate was over and that the sentencing would be scheduled for 8:00 AM on July 11th.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Li Hongzhang's Great-Granddaughter Files Lawsuit for Inheritance <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Accuses her Uncle and Brother</p>
<p>Requests Division of 750,000 Taels</p>
<p>The case of Li Jiaheng, the great-granddaughter of the late Qing Dynasty Minister Li Hongzhang, suing her husband for discord in the Special District Court, has been reported in this newspaper many times. Recently, she filed a lawsuit for property division. Yesterday was the date of the trial for Li Jiaheng's request that her uncle, Li Mugong, and her brother, Li Jiasu, divide the inheritance. Li Jiaheng arrived in court with her lawyer, while Li Jiasu and Li Mugong claimed to be ill and did not arrive. Their lawyers appeared in court on their behalf. The meaning of her complaint is that she is requesting to divide her late father's inheritance. The 181st Central Political Conference of the National Government resolved that women's inheritance rights should be re-evaluated, and women, whether married or unmarried, should have equal inheritance rights with men. Also, according to Article 1 of the Implementing Rules for Retroactive Inheritance of Property by Married Women, the resolution on the effective date of the new interpretation of women's inheritance rights stipulates that for property inheritance that began after the following dates, even married women have inheritance rights: (1) The date on which the resolution on the women's movement of the Second National Congress was notified to all provinces by the former Judicial Administration Commission in October of the 15th year of the Republic of China; (2) For provinces that were not yet under the National Government on the date of the notification, the date on which they came under its jurisdiction. Jiangsu Province came under the jurisdiction of the National Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Jiaheng's late father, Guojun, inherited property from his father and ancestors, owning approximately 3 million taels worth of fields and houses, which he shared with the defendant Li Mugong, who was his biological brother. On April 23rd of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Jiaheng's father passed away. His death was the date on which Jiaheng's inheritance began. The notification arrived before, and Jiaheng's inheritance began after, so Jiaheng certainly has the right to inherit property according to the law. Jiaheng has already entrusted lawyers such as Ge Zhaoji to send a letter to the defendant, requesting a division. The defendant has acknowledged all the property owned by the defendant in a letter of acknowledgment. Since the defendant acknowledged but did not actually implement the division, Jiaheng only has the right to resort to litigation to request a division. The court must approve the division, and so on. Judge Zhou Daren ascended the seventh civil court and first had Li Jiaheng testify. Since she disagreed with her husband, Zhang Jinjiang, and left home last year, she now lives alone on Avenue Aierjin. The marital issues have already been brought up in the divorce lawsuit in your court. However, her late father, Li Guojun, unfortunately passed away on April 23rd of the 18th year, and all the savings she should have received have not been given to her. After marrying Zhang, he did nothing and had no family property, so his clothing and food were all supplied by my family. Her father promised her a dowry of 20,000 yuan when he was dying, but it is still with her stepmother. All the jewelry and other items from her wedding have been used for daily household expenses, and she is now empty-handed. Even the court fees cannot be paid immediately, as can be imagined from her circumstances. She and Jiasu are biological siblings, and Mugong is her uncle. When her father was alive, all the family's property was managed by her uncle. Her family's assets total 3 million taels, including foreign houses at 1, 2, and 4 Xin Chongqing Road, the land rights to which are jointly owned, worth approximately 1 million yuan. When Taiping Bank opened, her uncle wanted to serve as a director, so he requested that her father deposit 100,000 yuan in cash, with 50,000 yuan deposited in Mugong's name. After her father's death, the money was still managed by her uncle. Other public stocks were worth approximately several tens of thousands of yuan. The property in Suzhou was worth approximately tens of thousands of yuan. There is a property behind the Nanjing Police Department, which was where her father's concubine lived when he was alive. After her father's death, it was also managed by Mugong. There are still 40,000 dan of rice in her hometown, and other items are worth approximately 3 million taels. Her father was the second eldest, and he and Mugong were the only siblings. Her father had Jiasu and her, and there were two deceased elder sisters. She should receive a portion of her father's share, calculated as one-quarter, which amounts to 750,000 taels. When her father was dying, he had an oral will, but no written will. Today, the defendant's lawyer claims that there is a will that can be proven, which she does not understand. At this point in the interrogation, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that Li Jiaheng was ill when she came to court, so some of the property numbers she mentioned in court may have been omitted, and a separate list would be presented later. Because the defendant did not arrive, the court adjourned the case and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<p>Effective July 10th</p>
<p>The west side of Shanghai is bustling, and there is a lack of good places to escape the summer heat in the evenings. The municipal ferry, in view of this, has added a night service, going directly to Donggou and Gaoqiao in Pudong, selling only first-class and second-class tickets. The outbound ferry departs from the Shanghai Bronze Man Pier at 8:00 PM every night, arriving at Donggou at 8:50 PM and Gaoqiao at 9:30 PM. The inbound ferry departs from Gaoqiao at 11:00 PM, arriving at Donggou at 11:30 PM and the Bronze Man Pier at 12:00 AM. The one-way ticket price is one yuan for first class and five jiao for second class, and the round-trip ticket price is one yuan and five jiao for first class and eight jiao for second class. The service will be effective starting July 10th. After this, people on the sea can take the ferry for a trip on the river after dinner, enjoy the cool breeze, and appreciate the scenery. People who live on either side of the Huangpu River during the day can also take the ferry home in the cool of the evening, which is also a convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Public Utilities Bureau Resolves Water Supply Dispute in Baoshan Lane, Zhabei <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Owner Closes the Water Gate</p>
<p>The Authorities Intervene</p>
<p>Baoshan Lane on Baotong Road, Zhabei, has 50 two-story buildings. Numbers 1 to 33 are owned by a Zhao family, and numbers 34 to 50 are rented out by the Zheng Shaode Hall. Recently, the Zheng family owner, citing excessive water fees, closed the main water pipe at the entrance of the lane throughout the day, except for 7:00 to 8:00 PM in the evening, allowing only a small amount of water to pass through. The residents felt inconvenienced and repeatedly negotiated without success, so they requested relief from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. The bureau sent staff to question the owner, but the owner did not admit to closing the water gate, instead claiming that there was insufficient water in Zhabei. Subsequently, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was ordered to investigate, and it was confirmed that the owner had closed the main switch of the lane. It was immediately opened, and the water flowed smoothly. The bureau also ordered the owner to fully supply water to the residents for drinking according to the regulations and not to close the water pipe arbitrarily, or face punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e152">A Record of Yesterday's Continued Trial in the Qu Case <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Mundon Already Found Guilty After Interrogation</p>
<p>After the trial of the American soldier who committed the assault in the Qu case continued yesterday morning at the military court of the US Marine Corps Headquarters on Haifang Road, the part involving Corporal Mundon has been completed, and he has been found guilty. According to the law, he will be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of six months to twenty years. According to American military law, if the defendant is not guilty, he will be released immediately after the trial. If he is found guilty, the sentence will not be announced in court and will be announced after being submitted to a senior officer for approval. After Mundon's trial was completed yesterday, he was still sent back to custody, so although the sentence was not announced in court, it is already known that he is guilty. According to the charges against Mundon of intentionally, maliciously, and without justifiable reason stabbing Qu Ruixiang and Ma Chengbu, two Chinese tailors, Mundon admitted to using a knife, but claimed that he acted in self-defense. Therefore, when the defendant's testimony was taken yesterday, Mundon did not testify again. Only Major Krut of the US Marine Corps testified that Mundon's character was good in the camp, and Hall, the secretary of the Naval Youth Association, also testified. Now, his sentence will be submitted to the Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet for approval before being announced. The parts involving the two orderlies, Ginas and Daniel, will be tried separately next week.</p>

<p>England's first most luxurious air yacht belongs to Hon. A. E. Guinness. The yacht's style is unique, a monoplane with three engines, built by Vickers, the airship manufacturing experts. The yacht can carry seven passengers, three pilots, and six hundred pounds of luggage. It can travel at a speed of one hundred miles per hour, with a maximum speed of one hundred and twenty miles per hour. The cabin is exceptionally luxurious, with wardrobes, dressing tables, bookshelves, and a very exquisite bathroom. Its comfort is comparable to a wealthy person's pleasure boat. Even the cabin's ventilation system is meticulously designed, ensuring a constant temperature regardless of the weather.</p>
<p>Kissing and Traffic Problems</p>
<p>Outside the Westfield station in New Jersey, USA, is a very busy intersection. Every morning, between 8:15 and 8:22, the trains depart, and the workers come like a tide to catch the train to work in the city. Their wives or lovers often come along to give them a farewell kiss. This has caused great difficulty for the police officers directing traffic at the intersection. They reported to the police station that the kissing of thousands of people every day is obstructing traffic, causing many vehicles to stop to avoid them. Therefore, they suggested that the authorities should stipulate that each person should only kiss once, and leave immediately after kissing, without lingering. However, despite the report, there was ultimately no solution.</p>

<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>In the past, poets and scholars mostly loved wine, such as Li Bai, Bai Juyi, and other great masters, all of whom wrote poems about drinking wine, expressing elegance and timeless sentiments. Therefore, wine was a source of recreation for scholars. The newly appointed National Government Committee Member and Acting Chief Secretary Ye Chuqiang was originally a famous figure in Shanghai, with a background in journalism. His literary talent and moral character were highly praised at the time. Ye loved wine, and would always have a drink with his meals during his free time. Occasionally, at elegant banquets, amidst the bright lights and wine, he would raise his cup and enjoy the moon, his leisurely mood soaring. When the wine was half-finished, discussions would arise, bringing joy to the entire gathering, which was particularly refined. Ye often took a little fine wine before writing, then rested his head on the desk for a nap. After waking up from the tipsiness, his literary inspiration would be ignited, and he would create beautiful prose with a flourish of his pen, without hesitation, in one go. One day, the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Liu Luyin, hosted a banquet, and the Deputy Minister of the Central Organization Department, Zhang Daofan, and Ye Chuqiang were also present. During the conversation, they mentioned Ye's habit of drinking before writing, and all deeply admired Ye's elegance. During the banquet, Zhang jokingly said to Ye, "You are getting older, why not abstain from wine to maintain your health?" Ye smiled, indicating that it would be difficult to break away from wine for the time being. The elegance of a famous scholar and the profound interest of a refined person were widely admired in the capital at the time.</p>

<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Silas Hardoon, a wealthy man in Shanghai, has passed away. The newspapers have detailed his family history and deeds. Here, I record a few anecdotes I heard in Wuxi as a separate biography.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Hardoon took his wife, Luo Jialing, to visit Wuxi and stayed in Mei Garden for half a month. They spent their days lingering at the Zhahe Pavilion and Tianxin Terrace, admiring the scenery. He once told the garden owner, Rong, that his love for this garden even surpassed that of the Aili Garden (Hardoon Garden in Shanghai). This is because Shanghai is prosperous, with bustling traffic and ten zhang (a Chinese unit of measurement, approximately 3.3 meters) of dust and noise, while this garden boasts the beauty of lakes and mountains, with a naturally tranquil and picturesque setting. The positions are different, and some things cannot be changed by money and power alone.</p>
<p>When Hardoon first arrived in Shanghai, he was merely a porter for a foreign firm. Later, he became wealthy by cooperating with the firm owner in land development and buying land. He benefited from the element of earth throughout his life. In the five elements, earth represents wealth. It is said that having earth means having wealth. Hardoon was fortunate to have the element of earth in his life, making him a living god of wealth. Luo was his companion during his humble beginnings. Fortunately, she had keen insight and could recognize a hero. She formed a bond of hardship with Hardoon and eventually became a divine couple.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Behind the Scenes of the Jiaotong University Graduation Ceremony <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The National Jiaotong University has been established for 35 years. Nearly ten thousand graduates have served the community. The 31st graduation ceremony was held on the 2nd of this month. Representatives from the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Railways attended. The day before, there was also an exhibition of achievements and various farewell dinners, making it an unprecedented grand occasion for the university.</p>
<p>The Clever Metaphor of a Daughter Marrying　On the evening of the 30th, the president of the university held a farewell dinner for the graduating students. A banquet was held in the Wen Zhi Hall, attended by more than 200 guests and hosts. President Li Zhaohuan said in his speech that the graduation of the students was like a daughter marrying. They usually gathered together, but now they would be scattered to the ends of the earth. This made the parents (referring to the faculty and staff) reluctant to part. He hoped that they would often return to their parents' home to visit after marriage, and if they were dissatisfied, they should tell him so that he could try to find a solution. Dean Shi of Beiping hoped that the daughters would follow the principle of "obeying the husband rather than the parents" after marriage and serve their husbands in every way. He compared himself to an old nanny. Dean Zhong said that when the young ladies were working hard, they should not forget their original identities. They were "from famous families" and not ordinary girls. They should not only follow the old rules in railway construction but also improve them from time to time. His remarks were particularly clever and made people laugh heartily.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Smiling Face　Mayor Zhang, the representative of the National Government, gave a sincere speech. He wore a white Zhongshan suit that day and spoke with a smiling face, hoping that the graduating students would not fail the government's painstaking efforts in cultivating talent. Then, Xu Juntao, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau and representative of the Executive Yuan, gave a speech, discussing various inventors such as Ford and Edison, citing them as examples to encourage the students.</p>
<p>Flower Baskets Piled in Front of the Podium　It is common practice for female schools to present flower baskets at graduation. However, this was the first time it had been seen at the graduation ceremony of Jiaotong University. This year, because three Misses graduated, many people presented flower baskets, which were colorful and piled in front of the podium, adding a lot of color to the auditorium. The university also considered this graduation of female students as an unprecedented event for Jiaotong University and specially issued diplomas separately to show their excellence.</p>
<p>Ma Yinchu's Humor　Ma Yinchu, the Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan, is known for his humor. In his speech that day, he described the evils of society and how easily those who were new to it could be assimilated. His remarks were particularly profound. Ma said that in the past, there was an American student who returned to China and worked in an institution. According to the institution's rules, bonuses were distributed every year. In the first year, the student firmly refused to accept the bonus, believing it to be ill-gotten gains and should never be taken. In the second year, before the end of the year, he had already asked his colleagues when the bonus would be issued. In the third year, he went even further and paid for the bonus in advance. It can be seen that the environment changes people, which is alarming.</p>
<h3 id="e157">A Small Talk on the Willow Leaf Goby <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The willow leaf goby is a small fish, but it is quite famous in Wuxing. The fish resembles the fork-tailed goby, but it is rounder and more plump, and its mouth is also more rounded. When cooked thoroughly with clear oil, the taste is not only delicious, but the flesh does not contain small bones, which is a special feature. The belly is full of eggs, which have a unique flavor. Therefore, when people in Huzhou buy willow leaf gobies, they always choose those with full breasts, presumably because the many eggs are enough for a good chew.</p>
<p>Willow leaf gobies are not often seen. They usually appear in groups during the fourth and fifth months of the lunar calendar when the rainy season begins and the streams rise. Wuxing is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the accumulated rain flows horizontally and rushes down. At this time, the willow leaf gobies begin to come out in groups and swim upstream against the tide, scattering their eggs in the streams and lakes. Fishermen know their habits and usually set nets at the point where the water flows rapidly to wait. With one lift of the net, they can catch dozens. These lively little fish are caught and sold immediately, often being served on the table less than half an hour after being caught. Therefore, willow leaf gobies in Wuxing are never kept overnight. Even if fishermen occasionally cannot sell them all, they must return home to share them with their wives and children.</p>
<p>According to the villagers, a magistrate once came to govern Wuxing and did not recognize the willow leaf goby, thinking it was an ordinary fork-tailed goby. Later, his staff praised its beauty and cooked it for him to taste. The magistrate enjoyed it greatly, saying it was the best thing he had ever tasted, and asked why the willow leaf goby was so particularly delicious compared to other fish. The staff said that most fish swim downstream, but this fish uniquely swims upstream against the current. When the water flows against the current, the force is strong, and the fish willingly withstands the impact. It is said that it is tempered by the force of the water, which makes it develop more fully and deliciously than other fish. This theory is also reasonable, so I record it.</p>
<p>The season for willow leaf gobies in Wuxing is only a few weeks each year. The fish is best eaten immediately after cooking. It often spoils overnight. Therefore, it can be sealed in cans, which is suitable for other fish, but not for willow leaf gobies. I used to live in Wuxing and tasted its deliciousness. In recent years, I have been traveling far from home, and I have no fortune to enjoy the delicacies of my hometown. Writing this, I cannot help but drool.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Travel Notes from India (61) <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On February 16th, I rode my bicycle from the Benares Hindu University to Sarnath, also known as Deer Park, where the Buddha first preached to the five monks. I have visited it several times, but not in detail. Today, I went to visit again. This place is about five or six miles from the city, which is about sixteen or seventeen Chinese miles. I went northwest out of the city, passing Victoria Park and crossing a clear river. There were fewer and fewer residents. When I reached a place, there was a sign saying "To Sarnath," so I turned northeast. According to the municipal and township governments, this sign is very important and should be written in large letters on the main roads to make it easier for pedestrians and save the trouble of asking for directions. On both sides of the road were small houses of residents, and the women all had red flowers pierced through their noses. The people were all very dark. From here, the car went north, and the road was flat and clean. Cars came and went, and the dense shade of the trees was very lovely. Going due north again, I arrived at Sarnath and saw the newly built Buddhist University. When I arrived, there were Burmese monks there. Two teachers and eight students were in class. A retired old gentleman was teaching English. The Burmese monk told me that he was a lawyer from Allahabad who had retired in his old age and wished to build a house here to spend his remaining years and enter Buddhism. In his spare time, he taught the young people science and kept many of his English and Indian books in the library. Several of his students had become famous, so he did not miss his home. I waited for him to finish class and invited him to talk under the trees outside. He had heard my lecture in Allahabad. Now, he was directing several servants to build a house and transport wood to live near the monks. This is because the Deer Park is open and spacious, with many trees and a small river, making it very suitable for building a house here. There are many rich people in China who do not know how to use their wealth to enjoy themselves. This old man is also awakened. India is peaceful everywhere. Building a house on the road and enjoying the mountains and rivers is enough to spend his life. The monks were very happy that I had come and offered me a glass of milk. When they have completed their studies in the future, they will all have to come east to China and Japan to revive Buddhism. When I am with the Indians, we all feel very close. They regard China as their own flesh and blood, and the Chinese also feel that India is their spiritual motherland. To the south of the university, there is a group of houses. I went to see it with the monks. They said it was the public place of the Nigrantha sect. The houses are solid, about a hundred or so, with residences inside. It is very unclean. It seems that the Nigrantha sect has not declined to this day. I saw their new temple in Calcutta, which was very magnificent. I asked the monks about the Nigrantha sect. They said that it is also considered a branch of Buddhism, but they are forbidden to wear clothes and practice naked, enduring the cold and heat without a thread, which is their characteristic. As for eating and drinking, they do not move their hands but are fed by others. I laughed when I heard this. There is nothing that does not exist in India. If this sect were to go to Siberia, how would they survive? A few dozen steps west of the Nigrantha public place, there is an Antiquities Museum, established by the British government. The trees are neat and tidy. When you enter it, many of the houses are closed. There are many things to see, such as stone Buddha statues. Many are beheaded and lack limbs. There are various Buddha statues, said to be the incarnations of the Buddha in past lives. If you calculate from this, there are countless kalpas in the past, and the various images of the Buddha can fill the whole world. I think that with the Buddha's wisdom, he must have known that stone statues are useless and superfluous, and he spoke of the merits of making statues to encourage all beings to happily make statues all over the world, using this to leave a memory for thousands of years in order to revitalize Buddhism. After all, this is the Buddha's wisdom, because he knew that everything is easily destroyed, but stone carvings are more permanent. However, everywhere, the heads and bodies are in different places, and the hands and feet are broken. The Buddha is helpless about karma. There are also statues of Krishna, etc., who are the leaders of Hinduism.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>After resting for a while, Ziliang smelled a burnt smell in his nose. He thought to himself, what's burning?</p>
<p>He had to push open the window:</p>
<p>"What's that smell? Something's burning!"</p>
<p>No one answered downstairs, not even the nanny in the kitchen. How strange! Where have the two people downstairs gone? The burnt smell from the kitchen was rising straight up. Ziliang knew that the rice had been burnt. They must have suddenly left halfway through cooking, and the firewood in the stove didn't go out, so the rice was all burnt.</p>
<p>"Is anyone downstairs?"</p>
<p>Still no one answered. Ziliang thought, if it keeps burning, won't the pot burn through? He was worried, so he didn't care about his own affairs and hurried downstairs. He looked around the living room, but there was no one. When he looked at the kitchen, he saw that the back door was wide open. It turned out they had gone out the back door. Ziliang looked out the back door and saw that someone was clearing the sewer in the alley, with three or four people standing there watching. Sure enough! His virtuous wife and his precious nanny were also standing there watching. Ziliang was furious:</p>
<p>"What's so interesting about clearing the sewer? The rice is burning!"</p>
<p>He shouted loudly.</p>
<p>The two of them were startled and rushed back in through the back door. Ziliang followed behind. He saw the nanny had already taken out the burnt firewood. Yueru opened the pot lid and added water. Ziliang's anger hadn't completely subsided.</p>
<p>"You haven't seen clearing the sewer before? You don't even care that the rice is burning."</p>
<p>The wife was unwilling to show weakness:</p>
<p>"Now that the rice is burnt, you can come over and add some water and put out the fire. Why don't you do it yourself and instead run outside to make a fuss? Burnt rice makes a better porridge than anything else. Don't you know that?"</p>
<p>"You always say that as long as someone is willing to study, no matter how big or small, everything is knowledge. Then, isn't clearing the sewer a kind of knowledge?"</p>
<p>Ziliang thought, now that they were in the kitchen, it was none of his business. His own work was important. Once he decided this, he turned around and went upstairs.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Gold Standard Prices Ultimately Trend Downward <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>US Attitude Firm on War Debt Case</p>
<p>Total of 14.5 Taels Recalled Throughout the Day Yesterday, July 3rd, the gold exchange opened as usual. The gold standard trend was weak and the state was chaotic, fluctuating up and down. Throughout the day, a total of 14.5 taels were recalled. In the end, it continued to fall by 7 taels, entering within 700 taels. As for the silver market, there were many differences. It seemed that the European market was seeing a firm trend, but the gold price opened low. However, in the morning, there were 6 or 7 taels of trading, probably because both the official and unofficial exchange rates were loosening. There were various transactions on the table, but none were of large amounts. At noon, it went from stable to declining again. The war debt default case had not yet been resolved on the French side, and the US attitude was very firm, so people's hearts seemed to soften. The after-market fluctuated around 700 taels, but there were no special changes. In the end, it was at 699 taels and some odd cash. All of the July contracts that had not yet been rolled over had to be settled in cash yesterday by the exchange as usual. There were more than 20,000 contracts in total. It was found that short-sellers such as Fuchang, Yuanheng, etc., settled 7,000 odd contracts. Yuancheng, Qianchang, and Xiang each settled 2,400 or 2,500 contracts. The Ningbo gang settled 1,400 or 1,500 contracts, and the rest were all small amounts. Those who took in contracts were the Guangdong gang, with more than 10,000 contracts, Runxiangxiang, with more than 6,000 contracts, and Daxingyong, with 4,300 or 4,400 contracts. It is said that all have been cleared. It is said that the silver market may rise this morning.</p>
<p>The Opening Price in the Morning Immediately Saw a Drop of 5 Taels The August opening price immediately dropped by 5 taels, to 701.5 taels. Large bars of silver are on holiday here, with a unified low of 1.875. US silver rose 1.25, and private telegrams rose as much as 4.375. This is because people's hearts have turned around. Moreover, as Tongtaichang, Wanxing, Daxingyong, etc., all sold, it fell again to 94 taels. However, Shunlicheng, Fengyongheng, Yuwanxing bought in, and HSBC ate a long-term English gold contract for 1.4125, so it added up to 701 taels again. However, the sellers were diligent, and Yuanmao, Yongwu, etc., all sold. Also, because English gold saw a firm trend, the bank bought in at .25 and fell back to 694 taels. Fuchang, etc., came in to hedge, and suddenly lifted up more than 6 taels, to 700.005 taels. When the quoted price of English gold was already up 1.25, US gold was up .25, and Japanese gold was down 1.5 fen, the time was 697.5 taels. Shortly thereafter, the internal market was still stable, and English gold was available for sale at 1.4125. Because buyers were active in the market, such as Yuda, Yuanheng, Qianxiang, Yongfeng, etc., all competed to buy, the price suddenly soared, and it rose by 11 taels in half an hour. However, there were fluctuations of 3 taels in between. At 10:00, it reached 708.5 taels. Later, Zhifeng, Yongyuancheng, Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, etc., sold off. Also, because English gold could be settled at 1.4125, it fell by 4 or 5 taels again. However, there was a fluctuation of more than 3 taels in a moment. After 10:30, the trend was particularly weak, and the atmosphere was bad. Yuanmao, Yongzhifeng, Yonghongxing, etc., all sold. At noon, the English gold bank bought in at .1875. At 11:30, it was 699 taels. Mitsui absorbed 1.4125, and it rose again to 702.5 taels. Suddenly, there was news from the Indian exchange that it was 6 Annas higher, which immediately went down by 4 taels, to 98.5 taels. At noon, it closed at 99 taels. Many sellers made it back to within 8 taels. The quoted price was changed to 739.8 taels, with a discount of 42 taels to 31 taels. At noon, it was 41 or 42 taels.</p>
<p>The Result Was a Drop of 7 Taels and 1 Fen Compared to the 30th In the afternoon, it opened at 97.5 taels, followed by 700.005 taels. This was because the Indian exchange rate fell back 4 Annas. Before long, there were many sellers, and it had already retreated to 97.5 taels. Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Cuichang, Yongyuanheng, etc., came in, and it was heard that Huabi issued October English gold at 1.875, which was purchased by telegram from Mumbai, so at 2:30, it rose to 702 taels. Later, as the Indian exchange rate turned greatly to 3 Annas, there seemed to be more sellers. The English gold bank had bought in at .25. At 3:00, it was suppressed to 98 taels. Fuyu, etc., came to buy, jumping 4 taels. At 3:20, it was 702 taels. Zhifeng, Yong, etc., reappeared, and the market atmosphere declined. At 4:00, it fell to 98.1 taels. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of 2 taels with each other, from 700.0045 taels to 698.89 taels. However, there were no large transactions. At 4:30, the market closed at 99.4 taels, which was another drop of 7 taels and 1 fen compared to before the market closed (June 30). According to the day's maximum price of 708.5 taels and the minimum price of 694 taels, there were 14.5 taels of difference. The physicals opened in the morning at .01 taels, closed at noon at 97 taels, opened in the afternoon at 8 taels, and closed at 9 taels. The quoted price was discounted by about 40 taels, logged in at .02 taels to 699 taels, and watered at .02 taels, the same in the afternoon. Also, spot red strips were purchased by Yingfenghong Gold Company for several hundred taels at a price of 714.5 taels, which was sold by customers from this and other ports and by colleagues.</p>
<p>Transactions were Cleared Due to New Market Regulations The transactions of various firms were not very enthusiastic because the exchange implemented new market regulations. Those without certificates were not allowed to enter the market to buy and sell. Large firms such as Jizhi, Fengyong, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Wanxing, and Shunli all entered. Cuichangyong, Fuyu, Yuanxingyong, Yuda, Yuantai, and Hengyu had some ins and outs. Yuanmaoyong, Futaiheng, and Yuancheng all exited. Tongtaichang, Daxingyong, Yongfeng, and Qianxiang had a lot of ins and outs. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong and Dadecheng first entered and then exited. Yuanheng, Fuyu, and Cuichangyong all entered. Wanxing, Qianxiang, Yuanxingyong, Daxingyong, Yuantai, etc., entered and exited briefly. Bingxing, Futaiheng, Yuanmaoyong, and Zhenxiang all exited. The Guangdong gang watched and waited. The Ningbo gang entered 2,000 contracts and exited about 1,000 contracts.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Exchange Rate Trends are Loosening <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the English silver suddenly changed, while the American silver rose. However, in the three days of July 1, 2, and 3, the unified nuclear English silver still fell, and the American silver rose instead. However, the Shanghai market trend is shrinking. HSBC's various exchange rates increased by half a grade, with English gold at 1.25, now at one shilling, three pence, and .875. US gold is at .25, calculated at 32 yuan and .125. Japanese gold is reduced by one and a half fen, calculated at one tael, five qian, and three and a half fen. The rest are also longer. Probably the bank trading price saw loosening at the beginning, then returned to stability, then declined again at noon, and stabilized in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the end of last month, English gold is longer by 1.25, US gold is longer by 3.125, and Japanese gold is down by 2 fen. Probably the gold market continues to be weak, having broken through the 700 tael mark. However, the US and France have not been able to resolve the war debt issue for a while, so the market situation is still uneven. However, Chinese merchants are still trading diligently, with English gold still being sold more than bought, with about 300,000 pounds changing hands. HSBC, etc., have a strong desire to buy, with some hedging to transfer gold. Also, US gold is very scattered. Japanese gold was slightly bought out by Mitsui from Taiwan. Mumbai sent a telegram in the afternoon to buy long-term English gold.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Yarn and Cotton:  Reasons for the Sluggish Yarn Market <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Rumor in the Market That a Certain Major Merchant Is Shorting</p>
<p>The yarn market is very sluggish, and the downward trend is very strong, because a certain major merchant is selling off large quantities, and it is rumored in the market that he is shorting. The merchant has more than 20,000 bales of 10-count yarn, so people are becoming more and more fearful, and the market atmosphere is greatly dampened. The situation is extremely weak, and most people are inclined to sell off. Therefore, the market is trending lower and lower, with a sense of a river flowing downhill. However, current yarn transactions are still considered not bad, and the overseas cotton and yarn situation is calm, but the local market is extremely bad, and the future situation is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Marked Prices Plummet on Two Exchanges:  At the opening of the exchange's marked prices for the morning session, due to the decline in U.S. cotton, the market atmosphere suddenly fell by eight or nine qian to one or two liang. Due to large households selling off, the trading floor was very loose. The afternoon session was still sluggish, but a large short covering occurred, and each month fell again by seven, eight, or nine qian. The transaction volume was 47,700 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 6,900 bales, Tongyu 2,000 bales, Gengfeng 1,300 bales, Changfeng 2,450 bales, and Lichang 1,400 bales. Jifeng bought 1,350 bales, Heshen 900 bales, Rongxing 4,000 bales, Taichang 1,250 bales, Yiyu 1,900 bales, and Deji 1,200 bales. The closing prices of the marked prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>Marked Price Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance:  Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance</p>
<p>July 1589, Down 17, 53,800 October 1173, Down 17, 66,250</p>
<p>August 1595, Down 16, 96,050 November 1575, Down 17, 59,250</p>
<p>September 1572, Down 1.6, 78,650 December 1581, 518,350</p>
<p>Current Yarn Sales Are Still Good:  It was found that the total purchase volume by various merchants for the whole day was 2,200 bales, including 600 bales purchased by fellow traders. The market was average. Customer merchants purchased 1,600 bales from Sichuan, 55 bales from inland areas, 108 bales from Yunnan, 70 bales from Changsha, 50 bales from Xuzhou, 45 bales from Hankou, 120 bales from Guangdong, 50 bales from Gaoyang, and 100 bales from miscellaneous merchants, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Cotton Market Weakens Further <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending weak, and the situation is very weak, because the yarn market is sluggish, and the downward trend is severe, and the actual sales of various factories are dull. Therefore, people's hearts are becoming softer, but the sources from various routes are very scarce, it is said.</p>
<p>Han Cotton Prices Decline Consistently:  At the opening of the exchange's Han cotton prices for the morning session, the market atmosphere was very weak, and prices fell by five fen to three qian. The market situation was even weaker in the afternoon, and prices fell another two or three qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 52,600 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 1,700 dan, Xincheng 1,400 dan, and Yuande 1,400 dan. Gongtai bought 4,900 dan and Yiyu 2,200 dan. The closing prices of the Han cotton prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>August 3810, Down 55, 61,500 December 3625, Down 30, 45,700</p>
<p>Current Demand Still Not Smooth:  Current cotton business still has no progress. The source at the pier includes 50 bales of Yao cotton and 100 bales of wooden frame cotton, it is said.</p>

<p>U.S. Cotton Merchants Sell Off:  Yesterday, U.S. cotton was sluggish due to a lack of major buyers, merchants selling off spot goods, and poor news from Liverpool. Futures fell by 17 to 21 points, and spot goods fell by 15 points. English cotton futures rose by 6 points, and spot goods rose by 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 10 points. Indian cotton initially rose with U.S. cotton, but softened later due to good weather. Pingguoer rose by 3 rupees, and Aomula and Bairoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded below (2nd telegram).</p>

<h3 id="e168">Grain:  Main Reasons for the Relaxed Rice Market <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Hot Weather... Rice Will Spoil... Sales Are Remarkably Clear</p>
<p>Xinzha:  Yesterday, the sales channels for various goods were still sluggish, and inland ships continued to pour in. The stock at the river bottom was abundant. Due to the extremely hot weather, various rice shops were unwilling to add more stock, fearing that the old stock would spoil, so the trend was becoming more relaxed day by day. Changxi thick japonica and early and late rice each fell by one or two jiao, and Luyang pointed rice also fell by about one chi.  Shanghai pointed rice also showed signs of weakness, and special top-quality goods were all down by one and a half chi. Customer pointed rice arrived and sold equally, with no change in price. Glutinous rice was dull, and the market had no ups or downs. Yin Hua lacked goods on the market.</p>
<p>Hu South:  Yesterday, although the source from various merchants was not much, the sales in urban and rural shops were limited due to the hot weather, and the market in Zhabei was becoming increasingly sluggish, making the intention to purchase even duller. Those who left were all just trying to force down prices. Thick japonica continued to be reduced by two or three jiao, and the middle-grade old stock was sluggish, falling by about four jiao. There were also few sources of thin rice. Yongjiang merchants felt that sales were becoming increasingly unviable. Although this street picked high-quality goods to move, the price was also reduced by two chi. Duyang pointed rice was scarce and the shape was fixed, while the middle-grade old stock was dull. Bian Yin's fresh high-quality goods were slightly more viable, while the old stock still lacked transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Flour Market Can Still Hold Steady <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Sales to the North Continue... Factories Reduce Output</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, saw weakness in each month during the initial trading session, because although the quoted price of foreign wheat recovered by one or two jiao, the gold market not only did not see a huge change after customs reopened, but was instead about six or seven liang lower than the previous time, causing people's hearts to soften when quoting prices. However, the northern merchants still continued to absorb purchases, and the factories did not release large quantities. Although transactions were scarce, the market atmosphere was stable, recovering by about one fen compared to the initial opening. By the time the afternoon market opened, transactions were even fewer, but because spot goods for military ships were relatively scarce, spot withdrawals required an additional five fen, which supported the market atmosphere for this month. Distant months saw foreign wheat transactions again, and although the factories did not release goods, people's hearts could not help but be dimmed. Looking ahead, it is feared that the market will still be dragged down by foreign wheat. As a result, it was five li better than the previous day, August was five li better, September and October were unchanged, and November and December were slightly better by two and a half li, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Hope for Wheat Market to Improve Fades <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Existing Stock Is Very Thick... Foreign Wheat Ordered... Factories Dump Forward Months</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in both the morning and afternoon sessions, saw each month unanimously showing signs of softness and weakness. Those who based their expectations on foreign exchange rates have now lost hope, as the gold market opened low. Furthermore, in reality, the existing stock of wheat in the local area has reached around 100,000, and the factories all have foreign wheat, so they have little interest in local wheat. It is also rumored that the telegram sent out by the traders has been confirmed, and 7,000 tons of white wheat from Western Australia, to be shipped in September, have been traded at a price of only four liang one qian three fen. Therefore, the quantity of forward month dumps was very large, so each month was trending loosely. As a result, this month was three fen lower than the previous day, August was one fen lower, September was two fen lower, October was five fen lower, November was three fen lower, and December was one fen lower. The factories did not inquire about the current wheat market, and the market was soft and loose. Only the Ningbo distilleries purchased over 1,000 packages of wheat from Anting, Nanjing, and Liuhe, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e171">North-South Goods:  New Jinshan Mushrooms are Priced High <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Jinshan mushrooms have had a poor harvest of new goods this year, so the price is high. According to a telegram from Guangdong merchants yesterday, the purchase price must be 90 yuan, so various firms are still waiting and watching and have not yet purchased. Of course, the sellers dislike the high price. It is planned to first purchase a small amount to test the market, so as to avoid losses. If it cannot be sold, then after holding on, the price may become more relaxed.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Silk and Tea:  New York Silk Sales Stagnate <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Due to Extremely Hot Weather... Silk Factories Shut Down</p>
<p>New York has always been the largest area for selling raw silk. Unexpectedly, since the summer, silk sales have not improved for a long time, and recently they have become stagnant. Local Chinese silk merchants sent telegrams to New York to inquire. According to a telegram from the Silk Industry Association, New York has had extremely hot weather in the past week, and various silk weaving factories have announced shutdowns. The raw silk market has no factory sales, so the telegrams sent by Shanghai Chinese silk merchants have not been forwarded. Telegrams to Lyon and England silk have also rarely been forwarded to Shanghai. Yesterday, only Kaili imported 10 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, Xinfu imported 6 packages of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and Kechang imported 5 packages of yellow silk. The price was still stable, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Haining New Local Silk Opening Prices Rise <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Silk Production is Extremely Poor... Summer Silkworms Are Also Not Good... Arrivals Are Not Strong</p>
<p>Haining is a silk producing area, and silk weaving factories are numerous. The consumption of local silk has increased sharply. This year's spring harvest was poor, and the amount of local silk produced has been greatly reduced. Silk merchants have been weighing and selling for more than ten days, and the silk arriving on the market is not strong. Silk factories are competing to purchase raw materials, and supply cannot meet demand. The price of silk is rising step by step. High-quality fine silk has opened at 68 to 70 yuan per 100 liang, and thick five-thread silk is 18 to 19 yuan, up another four or five yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Needle Eyebrow Green Tea Sales Are Rebounding <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the needle eyebrow green tea from various incoming estates, such as Yingzhuang Xiehe Jinlongyuan Sheng and other firms and the China Tea Company, were all searched for and purchased, and transactions became smoother. However, the selling price was five or six liang lower than before. The Gongxi category, such as Baitou Zhuang Qianyi Ruichang and other firms, also had sporadic purchases. The market was unchanged. However, the most important Zhenmei green tea market has become more and more quiet. Only the core-extracted goods had a slight outlet yesterday, and the rest had no transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Piece Goods:  Woolens Have Only Sporadic Transactions <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The woolen goods business has been declining day by day. Various summer white goods, except for a slight embellishment from the Shanghai tailor shops on this street, have not been inquired about at all. Most of them are retail businesses involving cutting and selling piece by piece. White Biji, white Zhigong, feather yarn, barrel cloth, gauze twill, crepe cloth, yellow twill, etc., continue to be needed, but purchases are not large, because it is already late, and most people want to sell off their existing goods. Yesterday, Ningfeng silk's striped barrel cloth sold for three liang five qian and a half, while Susheng sold for three liang. Mitsui silk stripes sold for three liang six qian, white Biji for four liang, and white Zhigong for four liang five qian and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Raw Cotton Yarn Sales Are Uniquely Strong in the Hot Weather <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>This Factory's Cotton Cloth:  The market rose and then softened, because the overseas cotton market was sluggish, and the gold price was difficult to rise, so people's hearts were scattered. However, there is a severe shortage of spot goods for fine cloth, so it has not fallen. Yihua's Golden Three Pagodas bleached cloth is also firm, selling for nine liang six qian. Since the unbleached cloth wholesalers have united, the price of goods has been able to hold steady, especially the Blue Double Fish silk that refuses to loosen at all. The Ten Thousand Years Green fine cloth, which was temporarily out of stock, has gradually arrived in Shanghai, opening at nine liang. Among the coarse cloths, the 9-pound and 11-pound goods have slightly fallen, the 13-pound goods are stable, and the 16-pound goods are not as smooth as before. The sales of this factory's velvet cloth have also come to an end.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods:  The overall market is slightly down, with the Eastern goods' Moonflower Velvet and Zhigong Ni being relatively soft. In fact, the July goods have gradually arrived in Shanghai, and since the gold market has fallen, the tax rates and pricing are smaller than before, so everyone wants to sell. Bleached cloth is also soft, with Magpie Bridge Meeting at twelve liang five qian and a half, the Three Cities at eleven liang nine qian, and Heavenly Gift Golden at ten liang four qian. Fushou Samsung is eleven liang one qian and a half. Only patterned cloth is still hard, regardless of light or dark colors and Luen Chang goods, all must be exported at five liang. Raw cotton yarn has been selling well due to the continuous hot weather, with forty or fifty pieces sold every day. Dian Qiuxiang is ten liang one qian, Little Beauty is eleven liang nine qian and a half, and Hanshan Temple is nine liang seven qian, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Hardware:  English Tinplate Market Revives <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Garden Lead Wire Arrives, Price Falls</p>
<p>English Tinplate:  Since the foreign exchange rate has become loose, the standard has been affected first, and selling prices have fallen one after another, selling for only fifteen liang per box. In recent days, overseas pricing has increased, and local business has also been very active, so 800 or 900 boxes have been opened, and the market has recovered to fifteen liang four or five qian per box, and 100-pound goods have also risen to sixteen liang five qian, it is said.</p>
<p>Garden Lead Wire:  Previously, due to a shortage of goods, the standard soared, rising to five liang and a half per bundle, so the general industry purchased from Japan. In recent days, goods have continued to arrive, and the Japanese exchange rate has also fallen, so the cost is low. Various industries have adopted the principle of selling off goods, so the market has declined, and each bundle is selling for only four liang seven qian and a half, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Grievances of American "Editors and Publishers" <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Gangster Movies and News are Harmful to Youth; The American People are Drowning in a Sea of Vulgar Literature.</p>
<p>The American magazine "Editors and Publishers" states that Paul Block published an editorial in various newspapers titled "Stop Gangster Movies." The president of the World Film Association, Mr. Lan Moore, replied in a letter, saying, "Why not instruct your newspaper reporters to stop publishing gangster news?" He also stated that he knows the activities of gangsters are indeed a kind of news material, and at the same time, they are also film material because they are an important part of world affairs. Therefore, they are bound to be shown in movies, just like being published in newspapers. He concluded by saying that he has never seen a film that rewards gangsters. According to the reporter's view, the way some newspapers, film companies, book publishers, and drama producers have handled crime news in the past five years should be widely criticized. Mr. Lan Moore may not have seen films that reward gangsters, but we have. The way some newspapers extravagantly narrate gangster news is equally harmful. It must be known that sensational robber behavior best suits the tastes of generally ignorant, idle, and passionate youth who are eager for love and indulgence in seeking pleasure. Although most films, books, dramas, and newspapers indicate that evil people are eventually arrested and reviled, the allure of an exciting life may not be restrained by the thought of prison. Therefore, all those who edit news and produce films should realize the importance of their responsibilities. All of life, whether good or bad, must be depicted according to its truth. If it is excessively described, given seductive colors, and then publicly performed, it will be greatly harmful to civilization. Today, the American people are already drifting in a sea of vulgar, inelegant, mixed, and impure literature and films. This kind of literature and film, under the name of realism, struts around arrogantly, looking down on everything. Even if we don't consider morality and civilization, but only for the sake of safe profit-seeking, we should not indulge this evil trend.</p>

<p>Madrid News: Spain has a traditional custom of bullfighting. The scene of bullfighting is extremely cruel. In recent years, under the vigorous opposition of animal protection societies, the general psychology has gradually changed, shifting their interest to beneficial sports such as tennis and football. Furthermore, animal protection societies have advocated the enactment of laws against animal cruelty. The former Duke of Alba gave his full support. Now, there has been great progress in laws concerning animal cruelty. Recently, two people were sued for abusing a dog, and the court sentenced them to fines and imprisonment according to the law. Public opinion in society has undergone a complete change.</p>

<p>— Yao Qu</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Wilen, Vice President of the American Astral Communication Society, returned from a German conference and stated that scientists in that country are secretly researching and inventing a rapid-fire aircraft that can cross the ocean in half an hour, hoping to realize this in the next two years. It is said that the operation of this aircraft relies entirely on liquid fuel, and its horsepower is greater than that of all current fuels. Now that liquid fuel has been invented, the fundamental problem has been solved, and the period of realization is only limited to the final improvement of the rapid-fire aircraft. Once this aircraft is put into practical use, it can carry 50 pounds of mail each time, making communication between Europe and the United States more convenient. In the future, by using this aircraft as a blueprint for gradual improvement, the ideal of lunar travel may be greatly realized within ten years. After this news spread, it was like a thunderclap, astonishing the American scientific community. No one expected that the Germans, in their silence, still had such far-sighted research.</p>
<p>Amidst this shock, news suddenly arrived that the Paris Morning Post's correspondent in Germany had been expelled because the correspondent secretly entered a laboratory, photographed instruments, and was discovered, immediately being deported. Although some say that the correspondent's actions were improper, the German's painstaking research and strict secrecy are evident here.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The American Scientist's Strange Theory: Don't Continent Sigh for the Moon Leaving as Its Son <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>San Francisco News: Green Shan Huang, present at the Gadge Gege Dr. Science Conference, published his research at the conference, stating that "The moon was once separated from the earth, and the part of the Pacific Ocean is where the moon came out. Like the land order of the American continent, a granite belt was discovered at a depth of twenty-five miles below. This land order is not the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, but the place where the continent continuously ends is the bottom of the ocean. Based on the experiment of the past two years, the earthquake in California originates from the Mojave Desert, eight miles deep in the Pacific Ocean. Most of the earthquakes in the Pacific Ocean originate from the thin land order taken by the moon. This is probably because the continent sighed for the moon leaving as its son." Also at the same conference, Mr. Feiya Lian published his research on the Sang Jia Sha Island earthquake, saying that "The moon's gravitational pull on the tide is related to earthquakes."</p>

<p>Infantry-Based Strategy Presents a Major Change</p>
<p>London News: The British Army authorities believe that future battles will start with tanks, so the standing force uses four battalions of tank brigades, 200 tanks, equipped with full-wavelength radio and three 47-meter projectile guns. The tactics first involve sending three-ton light tanks to rush the battlefield, then dispatching super-heavy tanks to clean up the remaining enemy forces, coupled with attacks from the air and the organization of support squadrons, requisitioning civilian vehicles to transport troops. A major change is presented to the infantry-based strategy.</p>
