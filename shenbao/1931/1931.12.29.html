<p>時評</p>
<h3>這一年</h3>
<p>一年來的天災和人禍</p>
<p>一九三一年眞是我們國家丨丨不。我們平民大衆多災多難的一年。旱魃的熬煎。洪水的泛濫。砲火的摧毁。兵匪的荼毒。長江以南。大河以北。斑斑的血跡。纍纍的白骨。和一片凄厲的哭聲。裝成了一幅慘絶人寰的畫圖。這是天災。還是人禍。是不可避免的末刦。還是惡因所必然獲得的惡果。假如這是人禍而非天災。假如這并非不可避免的刦運。而是由於我們自己種下了惡因。那末。我們便得問。這種惡因的是誰呢。這造成慘絶人寰的浩刦的罪魁又是誰呢。</p>
<p>一年來我們所罹受的災禍水旱冰雹虫疫兵匪。種種天災人禍。一齊降臨。綏遠。甘肅。陜西。歷年旱災。迄未甦復。據報紙上的記載。如甘肅統計受災區域。其六十餘縣。人民求食不得。甚至以人肉充飢。同時更加以全境皆匪。　源。禮縣。鎭番。全城都被屠殺。武威。天寗。定臨。潭武。山通。渭武。都各屠殺三千四千人不等。此外還有兵災。軍閥强迫徴兵。由人民攤欵僱買。每人平均以二百元作價。又因軍費無着。勒令人民種烟。人民賣妻鬻子。以滿其誅求。總計全省人民死於年荒的約百四十餘萬。死於疫癘的約六十餘萬。死於兵匪的約三十餘萬。死於凉屬地震的約五六萬。總計死亡在二百四十餘萬以上。如陜西。共九十二縣。大旱三年。盡成災匪。災類繁多。亘古未有。全省荆棘遍地。竈突無烟。浮屍殘骸。觸目皆是。如河南。去年戰禍。受害最慘兵匪水旱蝗雹。備歷徧嘗。全省災區。達六十餘縣之多。尤以固始。西平。杞縣。確山禹縣。尉氏。新安。滑縣。原武等縣。受災特重。如綏遠。三年以來。天災時作。老幼餓斃。婦女流離。全綏人口原爲二千二百萬。今已減至一千八百餘萬。如靑海。兵匪疫荒。災情不亞於陜甘。僅就疫災言。蒙古二十九族。死亡七萬餘。海南人族。死亡九萬餘。玉樹二十五族。死亡十餘萬。加以其他兵匪荒歉死亡之數。爲數之鉅。更可想見。如寗夏。兵匪交迫。民死無所。災民困於飢寒的亦達數十萬之多。西北各省。災况已如上述。而長江流域各省的共禍。更是如火燎原。不可嚮邇。如江西。歷年以來。爲共產黨的巢穴。共化區域計三十三縣一市。半共化區域計二十一縣一市。勢力散佈的計二十縣。省政府勢力所能及的。實際上不到十縣。如湖南、共黨勢力之盛。不亞於江西。又如湖北安徽。廣東。江蘇。福建。四川。雲南。差不多全國各省區無不受共禍的荼毒。共軍所至。阡陌盡平。房屋盡燬。散軍遊擊。出没無常。豪紳地主。恣意殺戮。更使全國陷於極端的恐怖。感受極端的威脅。綜計各省人民遭受共禍。爲數當亦不少。</p>
<p>中央爲此一心腹隠患。朝夕不安。曾三次大舉圍剿。决意以全力澈底肅淸。先後三次。共動員了七十萬大兵。第三次蔣主席親往江西督剿。然而不幸師勞無功。而且據非官方的統計。中央軍的損失。總數在二十萬以上。死亡上中將校更是不少。</p>
<p>六七月間。積久霪雨。全國更突然發生了空前慘重的水災。洪水所至。人畜漂流。田廬盡毁。據國府水災委員會統計。已有報告的災區。浙江有十一縣。江蘇十九縣。安徽二十六縣。江西六縣。湖北十六縣。湖南二十七縣。山東十五縣。河南十九縣。陜西三縣。總計縣數爲一四二。被災人數爲四四·四七七·四四三人。死亡人數爲一五四·六五五人。損失農田共爲三·五○五·四○二頃。損失廬舍共爲二·五五四·二三四幢。不過此項數字。爲僅就已有報告的災</p>
<p>區而統計。實則此次被災區域。共有十八省區。災民之多。損失之大。更不可數計。除上述九省區以外。兩廣川雲貴閩直遼甘。江南河北。無不巨浪拍天。一片汪洋。洪水所至。槪成赤士。嗷嗷哀鴻。遍地地皆是。現在天寒歲暮。災黎飢寒交迫。求生無路。呼籲無門。此一極盡人世慘酷的景象。我們親身目擊。人間呢。地獄呢。我們都得瞑目一細思。</p>
<p>中央對於這一次水災。也極爲注意。曾由國府明令組設救濟水災委員會。并曾連發七命。勵行節用。移欵振災。九月八日又下令發行振災公債八千萬元。準備九月間先發三千萬元。十二月續發五千萬元。又計劃向美國借麥賑濟。各省市也各組設水災救濟會。奔走呼籲。極爲努力。不過就實際事實言。三千萬元的振災公債。始終分文未發。而振災附捐。也至今分文未曾支撥。據救濟水災委員會統計。截至最近。財務組共收大洋六六八·九八四·七七五元。小洋一五·一七六角。銅元一六·二七五枚。由災區工作組直接分配災區。綜計爲三·一一四·二三六元。另有一小部分欵項則用之於衛生工作。此項數目。爲各方面捐集。非撥自政府。就此種事實而言。那末我們不能不承認政府對於振災的工作。始終只畫了一個大餅。呌災黎拿去充飢。</p>
<p>此外還有朝鮮排華事件。還有强佔東北的慘變。還有天津的變亂。種種禍變的損失。更是無法統計。總之。在目前。我們環顧河山。眞是是瘡痍滿目東西南北。無一片乾淨士。「民苦深矣。」我們不得不在這沉痛的現實裏發出這樣的呻吟。更不得不撫摸週身的瘡痕。而破口呼寬。這慘重的呻吟與沉痛的呌喊。是不是能隨風吹入黨政領袖的耳膜呢。</p>
<p>一九三一年誠然是我們多難多刧的一年。然而臨到絶望的窮途。誰敢說不會有一個新的天地之展開。中國便長此是「飢饉之國」嗎。便長此不能進入「現代的國家」之境域嗎。我們决不相信。我們當高呌着「怒吼罷。你老古的中國。奮起罷。你沉淪於苦痛之深淵的弱者。新的希望將伴着一九三二年而呈獻於我們的眼前。」</p>

<h3>日本掩耳盜鈴</h3>
<p>犬養毅之談話</p>
<p>一方謀鞏固軍部在滿勢力</p>
<p>一方以門户開放哄騙各國</p>
<p>（東方）　日相犬養毅今日語新聞記者、縱以滿洲爲禮物送與日本、日本亦不欲接受之、因滿洲邊界甚廣、防守經費極鉅也、日本在滿所欲者、在保護其條約權利耳、許多歐美人似抱一種誤會、瀋陽以西日軍行動之目的、頗屬可憾、彼等不知中國兵匪常混合莫辨、且亦兵可</p>
<p>爲匪、而匪亦可爲兵也云、路透社探悉日政府不久將發表一文、重行聲明滿洲開放門户與均等機會之政策、此文係答覆性質、因十二月二十四日駐日美大使曾晤犬養毅、責備瀋陽日軍當道不應干涉外人商業也、聞犬養毅當時答稱、日政府以同情接此抗議、但請美大使加以諒解者、目前非常情形、勢不得不暫時干涉貿易、日相依允兩事、（一）日本無據有滿洲之意、（二）日本開放門户政策、歡迎外人於常狀恢復時參與滿洲事業、日相又謂和平與秩序恢復後、日人與外人定有視前更大之機會云、聞美大使前曾因抗議滿洲開放門户事、往見幣原外相、但因内閣改組、故此問題暫時停擱、又聞瀋陽日總領事已向外國領事聲明、日本願負責使瀋陽臨時政府於穏固成立後、照償張學良所欠之外債、日本自己亦準備償付因日人行爲而受之任何損失云、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>周才良君訊（抵制日貨商店店員應負之責任）</h3>
<p>邇來對日經濟絶交之聲、瀰漫全國誠以此事而得能持久、已足制倭奴之死命、惟念已往之屢告失敗、言之實堪痛心、則今後之如何規劃、益覺有妥謀必善之必要、予旣爲商界之一分子、爰就服務所得關於抵制日貨之種種、應盡責任、條舉數端藉以自勉、并告邦人、亦即所謂「盡其在我」之意云爾（一）對於廠方、應本平日服務所得之經騐、及顧客對於國貨出品之批評總合意見、儘量貢獻於製造國貨之各工廠、俾廠方可依據報告精求改良、而於洋貨之替代品亦宜隨時注意、更須督促政府使彼爲大規模之仿造、如是國貨旣獲暢銷、而舶來品亦不抵而自制矣、（二）對於店主、此次商界對於抵制日貨較前固大有進步若自動封存及檢舉等事、熱忱可佩、惟聞仍有少數利慾薰心之商人、罔識大義、竟不惜奴顔婢膝以販售日貨、或改頭挽面、而力爲推銷、在顧客旣難辦别、自易朦混、而在店員方面、則耳目較周、自當本愛國之良知、爲竭誠之勸告若仍冥頑不悟、則繼之痛泣、痛泣不從、則惟有加以檢舉、縱虞因而失業、亦必得社會之同情而獲予援助、（三）對於顧客、當此國難臨頭、抵制日貸劇烈之際、一般顧客、自必以購買仇貨爲可恥、倘或遇有只貪便宜、而知愛國爲何事者、則當告以最近日人在我東省之種種暴行、及我國不得已而實行經濟絶交之緣由、使彼自動覺悟、必能另闢推銷國貨之機會、如有垂詢出品種類、尤當詳爲奉答、蓋此舉旣可博顧客之好感、而於營業上亦大有裨益也（四）對於自己、曩聞有身穿洋裝而侈談愛用國貨者時人皆目爲笑話、則我店員於推銷國貨之際、亦當各自省察、我本身之能否愛用國貨如舊製固可不論、若新添衣物而仍含有仇貨者、是不獨不能取信於人抑且自損人格語云、「君子必返求諸已而後可、」甚願我店員諸君三復斯言、</p>
<p>（覆）像周君所說、如果一一做到、可算模範店員了、原來抵制日貨這件事、一大半就要靠店員諸君、將來如果成功、論到誰的功績最大、一定有人會想到、是一般店員的功績最大、店員諸君啊、努力、努力、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>自世界生活程度增高以後。莫說中國人受其痛苦。即東西洋各國。亦英不受其痛苦焉。近見某外報載日本經濟恐慌之慘狀。失業工人。愈見增多。大學畢業生之賦閑者。達一萬五千人。即以女學生而言。竟有不待專門科畢業。而改習彈唱。欲爲歌妓有。言念及此。廻憶三十年前之上海。中虹橋鴨綠路一帶。爲日妓麕集之區城。間嘗與朋輩圍爐小酌於杏花樓頭。客有訽館役召日妓章程者。館役即以百艶圖進。任客選擇。大約貌醜者唱必工。貌妍者歌必劣。局至每小時需鷹翼五枚。善歌之妓手執牛角片。撥絃索。引吭而歌。殊不動聽。惟日妓之侍客也。界限極嚴。甲喚之來。即坐甲側。不肯與旁座之乙酬酢。滿一小時。即含笑鞠躬道珍重而去。絶無眷戀撒嬌等態度。據傳夜度資。亦祗倍給耳。後爲日領所禁。民國以來。不復見若輩踪跡矣。</p>
<h3>儒吏抗倭記</h3>
<p>— 秋文蔚</p>
<p>予嘗於明人筆記。獲讀任公抗任紀事。輒爲低徊景慕。而不能自己。公以科甲官丞倅。未嘗軍旅。迺於倉卒之際。慷慨受命。自期必死。竟不欲與家人訣。卒能驅新募之衆。殲剽悍之寇。衛疆固圉。克奏膚功。觀其蒙犯矢刃。傷痍遍體。以　一儒吏而能若此。可不謂之人傑也哉。烏虖。東北淪胥。黔黎水火。禍患之烈。較明季爲何如。而居高位擁重兵者。喪權失地。誤國殃民。任令異族憑陵。不能加以一兵一矢。猶審愼遲疑。瞻前顧後。必欲較量强弱。預計成敗。而後出於一戰。則終古將無可戰之機矣。爰擷任公舊事。叙其崖略。俾負守士責者。知所取法云爾。</p>
<p>任公環。字應乾。山西長治人也。世宗二十三年進士。又九年爲荻蘇郡丞·明年壬子閏三月。始以倭警聞。時承平久。兵猝起。遠近震駭。四月賊犯太倉。蔡中丞檄公討之。付兵三百。皆新募。公以必死。無旋踵。不入與家人訣。爲書付之而行。親介胄臨陣。以公激之。無敢不從。公躡賊所向設拒。敝衣芒屩。與士雜行。濡雨際。昏黑無休舍。依草間齧糒飲水同勞苦。且喻勉以古義烈事。故士遂歸心。與公死生之矣。明年癸丑五日。賊薄嘉定城下。公與浙裨將盧漟夾攻以舉燧爲約。四面進。士殊死。縱火殪之。賊豕突去。已而賊遍内地。公行抵太倉。則諸屯賊皆會集。傅於城。三面治攻具。有必剪屠意。肉薄而登。公率死士飛刃斫之。矢石交下。殺傷甚衆。賊始謂我易與。城可旦夕拔。至是始畏恐。甲寅正月。賊陷崇德。犯吳江。按使者周公如斗。檄公督俞大猷等諸軍夾擊之盛墩。斬三千級。擊之泖湖。斬七十三級。賊勢大挫。五月復來陸涇。公鏖之壩上。自辰至申。賊披靡。斬首八百。幾殲焉。而公以奉諱亟徒跣歸。居喪摧毁過甚。又以前奮不顧身。蒙犯矢刃。傷痍遍體。疾大作。亡何卒。</p>
<h3>瑣屑談</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>養貓不如飼鼠　隣有某甲。蓄一貓。初甚愛之。顧貓飽食安睡。一任鼠輩之横行。且時遺便溺於榻。或竊食廚肴。甚至庭中所蓄之金魚。亦恒膏其餞吻。甲大怒曰。吾日供魚肉折飯以養貓。冀其能弭鼠患也。今非惟不知捕鼠。反騷擾有甚於鼠。若爾貓者。吾將安用。乃逐之。不復蓄貓。惟日以米少許。置暗陬以飼鼠。詰旦視之。輒粒米無存。而鼠若知恩。自是亦不復患。甲嘗舉以告人曰。吾優事貓。而貓不知守分盡職。吾飼鼠。所費無幾。而轉能無害於人。是『養貓不如飼鼠』也。聞者傳爲笑柄。</p>
<p>一隻白烏龜滬諺喻「鵝」爲白烏龜。非眞龜有白色也。不圖白龜余曾見之。憶今秋八月間。一日傍晚。余閒步邑廟豫園九曲橋。憑欄俯視游魚。所旁有人驚語曰。「一隻白烏龜。」余諦視之。果見一巨龜浮泳水面。　周身呈白色。其頭尾足爪咸白。嗣經其處。遂不復見。按白麻雀固不足奇。不知此白龜亦爲希見之物否。特誌之以質博物家。又本埠某游藝塲亦嘗有白龜供人展覽。未審其形何若。產自何處。暇當一探之。</p>

<h3>出征</h3>
<p>— 靑年援馬團一團員</p>
<p>（九）離鎭江</p>
<p>我們在鎭江。足足停留了兩天。各個的精神都得着這長時間的休憩而奮發如常。於是我們又向前進行了。</p>
<p>十八日下午。我們謝别了鎭中同學。乘車離了鎭江。一路但聞軌聲隆隆。很像坐在鐵甲車裏面到了前線所聽得的鎗砲聲一樣。窗外萬頃田疇。毫不停留地旋轉着。宇宙的一切。何嘗不是像如此無休止地進行呢。但是。我却反感到我國目前的種種。竟都有停止前進的危險。這也許是日寇侵凌我們的原因吧。</p>
<p>約五點多鐘。我們將到南京車站。過外揚旗處。車忽然停着。接着來了一部機車。把我們所坐的一輛拖離了列車而向另一條軌道前去。不多時。旁靠了一個站台。站上不但没有歡迎的人們。而且旅客也不見一個。站旁的居户。僅有幾間草蓋的矮屋。車的左面。停着三五輛鐵蓬貨車。情景十分荒凉。這時正値黃昏時候。兼之當這冬季日短的時節。四面已很迷矇地辨不出什麽。祇見離車窗不遠有許多桅牆。這些這些。不由我不有些懷疑。莫不是政府取締我們嗎。我想。我的腦筋正在胡亂猜疑。恰巧團長到來。我不能再耐而終於向團長詢問。才知道京衛戍部遣送在京的各處請願學生回校。深恐學生們藉口歡迎我們而不肯回去。所以當局把我們來京的消息完全不給外人知道。爲了欲避人耳目。索性將我們的車輛也移到這江邊車站來。因此我們旣諒解了當局的苦衷。當晚就在車上過夜。</p>
<p>我們睡在車上。還是出發至今的第一回。雖然没有在鎭江中學時睡得那麽舒暢。但在一個集有各省代表氣味的車廂裏。尤其皆具决心同赴國難的弟兄都在一塊兒。將我們的眼光會移到各省市的人物去。把我們的心坎互相爭勝將來殺賊的勇威。結果。使我們親善的原素增加。殲日的精神堅强。</p>
<p>十九日我們仍在車上。不知如何金大同學已知道了。我們的消息。派代表前來接洽歡迎事宜。大約明晚始可在金大校舍住宿。</p>
<h3>救濟國難書畫展巵言</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>急矣國難暴日佔我東省復有攻錦之舉錦州若失。則平津危矣。平津危。則我東南各省勢將親臨其厄。故此時而欲謀救濟。尚有餘日。過此恐不復再予我人以從容綢繆之機會矣。我書畫家雖各以個人主義自矜。而至亡國喪邦之時。其痛苦則亦未異於人也。何香凝女士適自西歐歸。發起救濟國難書畫展覽會。海上書畫家皆被邀參與。一時景從。有若萬流歸海。何女士令人之景慕一至於此。抑亦共赴國難人同此心乎。以余之不才。亦將附驥尾夫大難臨頭。匹夫之責。孰忍不爲。是固余之志也余曾一再表示矣。徒以蹉跎之故。致未實現。大會推汪英賓先生與余任宣傳事宜。余雖無能。大義所在。惟有勉乎其難矣。銷劵結果異常美滿。鄭洪年葉恭綽二公之力實足成之。徴集之事。經劉海粟錢瘦鐵二公奔走。而結果乃超過預定之額。然而提綱挈領。而無何香凝女士朱少屏柳亞子二公之措置裕如。亦未易有若是之成效也。至會塲佈置。由孫雪泥薛保倫二公負責二公經騐旣深。能力又富。開幕時當有與我人以有條不紊之印象也。此次加入之作。盡屬諸名家精心傑構。余亦有拙作加入。余豈不知自避炫己之嫌乎。金躍於鑪。人詫以怪。余固不願也。然而宣傳所係。自不能因噎廢食。儻亦爲識者所諒歟。他日執銳奮進。救護有人。使山川還我。金甌不缺。國人蓋有以造成之。其功豈獨歸余書畫家哉。</p>
<h3>粉墨璅話</h3>
<p>— 佩蘭</p>
<p>玉堂春全劇。出山陜梆子。二黃靑衣。初不習此。余幼時聽歌菊部。玉堂春殊不多見。偶一搬演。胥屬之梆子靑衣。當時惟天鵝旦四盞燈玻璃翠小金娃輩爲優爲之。座客對此劇。亦不重視。轉不如燒骨計柳林池三疑計烈女傳等。受人歡迎。二黃靑衣前輩之享盛名者。如喜祿怡雲石頭常子和輩。均不見唱玉堂春。馮子和以正工靑衣兼花旦。負殊譽一時。亦未嘗以玉堂春名。新舞台遷十六舖時代。子和與毛韵珂俱屬焉。偶於日間演全本玉堂春。子和僅唱洪桐被誣一節。起解會審。均由韵珂承乏。韵珂則固歌梆子者也。嗣後有人將起解會審兩節。改成二黃。於是南北各靑衣花衫。殆無有不歌此二劇者。梅蘭芳程艶秋出。玉堂春益風行一時。艶秋以瑶卿之傳授。大唱新腔。效之者。尤變本加厲。雖舊規寖失。而顧曲者竟百聽不厭。然起解以前之三次嫖院廟會贈銀洪桐被誣諸塲。固猶是梆子舊規也。迨荀慧生徐碧雲繼起。全本玉堂春。始終以一人演唱。於是全劇悉改二黃。梆子面目。乃絲毫不復存在。徐碧雲姑置不論。荀慧生之玉堂春。則前半亦極有精彩。余尤愛其梳妝一塲之南梆子。詞旣雅馴。腔尤雋妙。宛轉嬌歌。蕩人心志。蓓開公司將此段收有唱片。愛觀玉堂春劇者。可試一聽也。</p>
<h3>睇嚮齋逞肊談</h3>
<p>— 程德全</p>
<p>辛亥鼎沸。識者已知淸之必亡。蓋督撫什九棄城遁。以身殉節者。閩督松壽。晋撫陸鍾琦。贛撫馮汝騤三人而已。降者亦三人。魯撫孫寳琦。桂撫沈秉堃。蘇撫程德全。是三人者。寳琦中變。秉堃被逼。獨德全反正最先。爲都督亦早。復任進攻江寗聯軍蘇軍總司令。以是尤見信於開國諸偉人。而遺老誚其不忠。世無是非功罪。自古已然。德全之舍巡撫而爲都督。名異而實存。民主之政與專制之制迴然不侔。無所謂貳臣之說。識時務者爲俊傑。德全之不欲絶其政治生涯。固不問政體之爲民主爲君主。官職之爲巡撫爲都督也明矣。德全字雪樓。四川榮陽人。廪貢生。納粟爲貳尹。官於皖。有人以事憾按察使趙爾巽。爲聯語諷之曰。「爾小生。生來刻薄。巽下斷。斷絶子孫。」爾巽怒。不知何人恶作劇。適德全詣謁。爾巽以告。餘怒未息。德全曰。我亦有所聞。已易詞爲「爾小生。生來秉性。巽下斷。斷不留情。」誠以公賦性純潔。執法如山。故思及此。雖不工。尚切題也。爾巽展顔曰。足見公道尚在人心。子之才學。於是見之。遂定交。後爾巽爲奉天將軍。德全已先在。晋秩州牧矣。爾巽累疏薦其賢。以道員超擢副都統。權黑龍江將軍。迨東三省改絃易轍。乞休去。再起爲奉天巡撫。與總督錫良議政不洽。營他移。不可得。忽思一計。以督撫同署。政權督爲主。撫無所事事。疏請裁缺。報可。良大愕。詰德全曰。上疏於朝。巡撫一人私專。秘不使預聞。何也。德全對曰。裁缺。裁吾自任之缺。儻乞示可否。制府必留我。留則缺不能裁。缺不裁。則吾退志莫遂矣。良無以難之。一笑而罷。稍選。撫蘇之旨下。良始憬然德全爲宦之巧。元年。臨時政府成立於南京。德全被選筦内務部。日追隨偉人之間。儼然以開國元動自况。議某事。德全將退席。同座責以大義。不顧而去。次日復議。詐稱得急疾。喉啞不能言。夕有遇諸唐紹儀座上者。德全方侃侃而談。中山聞而嘆曰。其人如此。不可與謀也。其時吳門兵變。都督莊藴寬乞罷免。陳其美稱德全熟悉地方情形。可復任。德全遂重握軍符。癸丑討袁之役。樹幟獨立。及敗。已先密電項城。謂被迫使然。非出自己意。項城覽電笑曰。雪樓從此休矣。自是十數年。衣袈裟。手經典。日誦阿彌陀佛。某歲卒於滬。遺言以僧服殮。殆有懺悔之意歟。某叟稱其下地成佛。則謔矣</p>
<h3>老百姓寫給軍人的一封信（上）</h3>
<p>— 老百姓</p>
<p>武裝的軍官和兵士同胞。</p>
<p>在我未說話之先。且把我的地位和你們的地位說個淸楚</p>
<p>我是中華民國人民的一個。是擔負國稅地方稅的國民。是國家的主人翁。是一年三百六十五日工作不休息的老百姓。你們吃着我們老百姓的。穿着我們老百姓的。你們旣不耕田。又不做工。又不經商。你們物質方面的享受。此我們老百姓要愜意得多。你們也曾想到。你們是天生成一個不勞而能生存的好命運嗎。我們拿血汗血代代價倈來供着你們。你們受我們的供養。你們也想到怎樣才對得住我們呢。也許你們中間明白一點的會說「我們是國家的軍隊。受老百姓血汗代價的供養是不錯的。但是我們是保護老百姓的。捍衛國家的。替老百姓殺端人的……」。旣是這樣。恕我唐突。我要站在老百姓的立塲上說幾句話了。平時可以促成亡國的内戰發生時。報紙上充滿了請纓討逆。枕戈待命。敵愾同仇的通電。多麽令人景仰呵。南口。武昌之役。造成世界驚人的戰績。這又令人多麽贊美喲。現在呢。暴日殺到家裏來了。共管中國的聲浪。又高唱入雲了。打開報紙來一看。請纓討賊者幾人。枕戈待命又幾人。敵愾同仇者更幾人。幾乎使我老百姓疑惑這次水災將以前内戰十分奮勇的軍隊。都漂到氷山上。凍着可憐都說不出一句話來了。東三省的土。不是中國的嗎。東三省的人民。不曾擔負軍費嗎。你們是國家的軍隊。應該不管東三省的事。不保護東三省人民嗎。你們眞是捍衛國家。替老百姓殺敵人的嗎。想到老百姓擔負。</p>
<p>的痛苦。和這次的事實。眼淚不禁要往心裏流了。武裝同胞們。怎樣才對得起老百姓。</p>

<h3>Declaration of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Establish the Principles of Political Reform</p>
<p>Grant the People the Opportunity to Participate in Politics</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Declaration of the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: Our party, upholding the Premier's teachings, has strived for the national revolution. Although we have experienced many obstacles, we have never wavered. At this time of internal and external troubles, we are united in our sincere desire to strive for the survival of the Chinese nation and the independence of the Republic of China. Therefore, on December 22nd of the 20th year, we convened the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee. The purpose is to work together with one heart and one mind to seek the survival of the Chinese nation and the independence of the Republic of China. To achieve this goal, we must first remove all obstacles between comrades and be eternally sincere. We must first meet the urgent demands of the people and make public all government affairs. We must concentrate talents to overcome national difficulties together. We must stabilize the villages and cultivate production. And above all, we must establish the personality of party members in accordance with the Premier's teachings of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, and extend this to the entire party and the entire nation. The violent aggression of Japan in the Northeast is intensifying, and the people of the whole country are deeply indignant. The congress believes that at this time of survival, sacrificing for the country and being a pioneer for the people is the responsibility of our party. Our party is determined to live and die with the country today. With this determination, we carefully examine the situation. Whether it is for national defense preparations for self-defense or for diplomatic strategies for self-defense, we await the judgment of world justice and the support of the people of the whole country. If China is isolated from the international community, and if the steps of the people and our party are not consistent, then the failure of the country can be asserted. Therefore, our party, on the one hand, should earnestly recognize the recent world situation and take all urgent and effective actions. On the other hand, it will immediately convene the National Crisis Conference and the National Salvation Conference to determine the fundamental policy for saving the country. The purpose of the National Crisis Conference and the National Salvation Conference</p>
<p>The First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee Issued a Declaration, Japanese Military Division Commander Tamon Ordered a General Attack on Goubangzi Yesterday Morning, Passenger Trains on the Longhai Railway Were Robbed Between Xuzhou and Haizhou (See Domestic Urgent Telegrams), Gandhi Returned to Bombay and Was Warmly Welcomed (See Foreign Urgent Telegrams), Disputes Occurred at the Daxin Dyeing Factory (See Local News)</p>

<p>is twofold: one is to concentrate the plans of specialized talents from all over the country to form a complete preparation; the other is to concentrate the opinions of the people to form a complete expression. With the whole country's opinions and preparations, we can then make a long-term struggle against foreign countries to recover our territory and complete our sovereignty. Therefore, the convocation of the National Crisis Conference and the National Salvation Conference is a matter of necessity and urgent expectation. Our party will formulate measures in the shortest possible time and implement them immediately. The purpose and urgency of convening the National Crisis Conference and the National Salvation Conference have been stated above. The congress, in accordance with the principles of democratic politics, further believes that it is necessary to complete local self-government as soon as possible and, in accordance with the Outline of National Reconstruction, convene national political participation bodies. In recent years, due to military affairs and banditry, the plan for local self-government has not been able to proceed in an orderly manner. However, our party's sincerity in completing political tutelage and granting power to the people has not been neglected. Therefore, on the one hand, we have decided to strive to promote the system of self-government in order to realize the era of constitutional government as soon as possible. On the other hand, we have decided to</p>
<p>In the Organic Law of the National Government, first give the people the opportunity to participate in politics. The Organic Law of the National Government has provisions for the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan to participate in the election of committee members. This is the principle of our efforts to promote democratic politics, follow the path of political tutelage, and guide the people to the path of constitutional government. The congress also believes that the organization of the National Government should not only give the people the opportunity to participate, but also ensure the stability of the head of state's position and the exercise of the independence of the five branches of government. Therefore, it is stipulated that the Chairman of the National Government does not bear actual political responsibility, and that the Five Yuan are each responsible to the highest authority. The principles of political reform have already been fully realized in the Organic Law of the National Government. During this period of political tutelage, if we do not actively seek the soundness of the party, it will inevitably affect the health of the government. The congress believes that the party's organization should concentrate cadre talents to strengthen the central party headquarters, determine the election methods of party headquarters at all levels to establish a model of democratic centralism within the party, and improve the guidance program for mass movements to organize consistent steps across the country. All the proposals for improving party affairs this time are based on this main significance to make decisions. "Unite against foreign aggression" is the common voice of our party and the people of the whole country. The congress believes that there are still urgent matters to be noted: domestic production is declining day by day, and social economy is gradually collapsing due to the decline in production. Due to the gradual collapse of the social economy, unemployment is increasing day by day. Due to the increase in unemployment, the flames of the Red Bandits are spreading. Due to the spread of the Red Bandits, production is declining even more. Cause and effect follow each other in an endless cycle. The internal troubles are more serious than foreign enemies. In this regard, the congress believes that we should properly determine the direction of controlling ourselves without harming national sovereignty, and only apply foreign capital and skills to develop national production and realize the Premier's industrial plan. We should also continue to work hard to suppress the Red Bandits in order to stabilize social order, actively carry out water conservancy projects, and raise disaster relief funds to help the people in the disaster areas. Only in this way can we quell internal troubles, strengthen national power, and concentrate our efforts to resist foreign aggression. The above-mentioned points are all necessary plans for saving the country during the national crisis.</p>
<p>The congress is willing to encourage all party comrades and all compatriots to work together and make concerted efforts to move forward. All our party comrades should especially know that the foundation of our party is the masses, and the purpose of service is the country. If the party is separated from the masses, the party will have nothing to stand on. If the masses are separated from the party, the country will have no way to survive. At this time of national crisis and deep invasion, we should share a sincere and frank heart, love and help each other, believe in and help each other. Then political tutelage can be completed, democracy can be realized, and national difficulties can be overcome together. Maintaining stability and rescuing the endangered depends on continuous and joint maximum efforts in the future. This declaration is respectfully offered for the common consideration of our comrades and compatriots. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Goubangzi: (1) At 3:00 p.m. on the 27th, train No. 601 left Dawopu for Goubangzi. Just as it left the station, two Japanese planes pursued it. Our armored train fired four anti-aircraft shells, and the Japanese planes fled in fright. (2) At 10:00 a.m. on the 28th, two Japanese planes came to Dawopu Station for reconnaissance, flying very low.

If they retreated, they would be shot. The Japanese soldiers were afraid that the civilians would defect, so they gave them guns but no bullets. (8) The Yingkou-Goubangzi branch line passenger train only went to Panshan on the 28th. Several Japanese planes went to Goubangzi and Jinzhou for reconnaissance several times on the 28th, but did not drop bombs.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>This Year</h3>
<p>Natural and Man-Made Disasters of the Past Year</p>
<p>The year 1931 was truly a year of calamities for our nation. It was a year of great suffering and hardship for our common people. The torment of drought, the devastation of floods, the destruction of artillery fire, and the scourge of soldiers and bandits. South of the Yangtze River, north of the Yellow River, there were scattered bloodstains, piles of white bones, and a desolate wail, forming a tragic and horrifying picture. Was this a natural disaster or a man-made one? Was it an unavoidable apocalypse or the inevitable bitter fruit of evil deeds? If this was a man-made disaster rather than a natural one, and if this was not an unavoidable calamity, but rather a result of our own sowing of evil seeds, then we must ask: who planted these evil seeds? Who is the culprit responsible for this catastrophic calamity?</p>
<p>In the past year, we have suffered from various disasters, including droughts, floods, hailstorms, pests, epidemics, soldiers, and bandits. All kinds of natural and man-made disasters descended upon us simultaneously. Suiyuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi have been suffering from droughts for years, and have not yet recovered. According to newspaper reports, in Gansu, the affected areas included over sixty counties, where people could not find food and even resorted to cannibalism. At the same time, the entire region was rife with bandits. The entire cities of Minyuan, Lixian, and Zhenfan were massacred. In Wuwei, Tianning, Dinglin, Tanwu, Shantong, and Weiwu, three to four thousand people were massacred in each location. In addition, there were military disasters, with warlords forcibly conscripting soldiers, requiring the people to share the cost, averaging 200 yuan per person. Furthermore, due to a lack of military funds, the people were ordered to grow opium, forcing them to sell their wives and children to meet the demands. In total, about 1.4 million people in the province died from famine, about 600,000 died from epidemics, about 300,000 died from soldiers and bandits, and about 50,000 to 60,000 died from the earthquake in Liangzhou. In total, the number of deaths exceeded 2.4 million. In Shaanxi, there were 92 counties, suffering from a severe drought for three years, which led to widespread banditry. The types of disasters were numerous and unprecedented. The entire province was covered in thorns, and no smoke rose from the stoves. Floating corpses and remains were everywhere. In Henan, last year's war caused the most severe damage, with soldiers, bandits, floods, droughts, locusts, and hailstorms all taking their toll. The disaster area covered more than 60 counties in the province, especially Gushi, Xiping, Qixian, Queshan, Yuxian, Weishi, Xin'an, Huaxian, and Yuanwu counties, which were particularly severely affected. In Suiyuan, natural disasters have occurred frequently for the past three years, with the old and young starving to death and women displaced. The population of Suiyuan, originally 22 million, has now decreased to just over 18 million. In Qinghai, the disaster situation of soldiers, bandits, epidemics, and famine is no less severe than in Shaanxi and Gansu. Just in terms of epidemics, more than 70,000 people died in the 29 Mongol tribes, more than 90,000 people died in the Hainan people, and more than 100,000 people died in the 25 Yushu tribes. In addition, the number of deaths from other soldiers, bandits, and famine can be imagined. In Ningxia, people were besieged by soldiers and bandits, and the people died without recourse. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims were trapped by hunger and cold. The disaster situation in the Northwest provinces has been described above, and the common disaster in the provinces of the Yangtze River basin is even more like a prairie fire, unapproachable. In Jiangxi, it has been the nest of the Communist Party for years. The Communist-controlled area covers 33 counties and one city, the semi-Communist-controlled area covers 21 counties and one city, and the area where their power is scattered covers 20 counties. The provincial government's power actually extends to less than ten counties. In Hunan, the Communist Party's power is no less than in Jiangxi. Furthermore, in Hubei, Anhui, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Fujian, Sichuan, and Yunnan, almost all provinces and regions in the country have suffered from the scourge of the Communist Party. Wherever the Communist army goes, the fields are leveled, and the houses are destroyed. Scattered troops and guerrillas appear and disappear unpredictably. Wealthy gentlemen and landlords are arbitrarily killed, further plunging the entire country into extreme terror and extreme threats. In total, the number of people in various provinces suffering from the Communist scourge is also considerable.</p>
<p>The central government is deeply disturbed by this hidden danger and has launched three large-scale encirclement campaigns, determined to completely eliminate it with all its strength. In the three campaigns, a total of 700,000 troops were mobilized. In the third campaign, President Chiang himself went to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression. However, unfortunately, the campaign was unsuccessful, and according to unofficial statistics, the central army suffered losses of more than 200,000, with many generals and colonels killed.</p>
<p>In June and July, after prolonged rain, unprecedented and severe floods suddenly occurred across the country. Wherever the floods went, people and livestock were swept away, and fields and houses were destroyed. According to statistics from the National Government Flood Relief Committee, the reported disaster areas included 11 counties in Zhejiang, 19 counties in Jiangsu, 26 counties in Anhui, 6 counties in Jiangxi, 16 counties in Hubei, 27 counties in Hunan, 15 counties in Shandong, 19 counties in Henan, and 3 counties in Shaanxi. The total number of counties was 142, the number of affected people was 44,477,443, the number of deaths was 154,655, the loss of farmland was 3,505,402 hectares, and the loss of houses was 2,554,234. However, these figures are only statistics for the reported disaster areas. In fact, the affected areas included 18 provinces and regions, and the number of disaster victims and the extent of the losses were even more countless. In addition to the above nine provinces and regions, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Zhili, Liaoning, and Gansu, as well as Jiangnan and Hebei, were all hit by huge waves and vast expanses of water. Wherever the floods went, everything turned into red earth, and the pitiful cries of hunger and cold could be heard everywhere. Now, with the cold weather and the end of the year, the disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold, with no way to survive and no way to appeal. This extremely cruel scene is something we have witnessed ourselves. Is this the human world or hell? We must close our eyes and think carefully.</p>
<p>The central government also paid great attention to this flood. The National Government issued a decree to establish a Flood Relief Committee and issued seven orders in a row to practice thrift and use funds to relieve the disaster. On September 8, it also ordered the issuance of 80 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, planning to issue 30 million yuan in September and another 50 million yuan in December. It also planned to borrow wheat from the United States for relief. Provinces and cities also established flood relief associations and made great efforts to run and appeal. However, in reality, the 30 million yuan in disaster relief bonds were never issued, and the disaster relief surcharges have not been disbursed to this day. According to statistics from the Flood Relief Committee, as of recently, the finance group has collected a total of 668,984.775 yuan in silver dollars, 15.176 yuan in small silver coins, and 16.275 copper coins. The disaster area working group directly distributed 3,114,236 yuan to the disaster areas. Another small portion of the funds was used for sanitation work. This amount was collected from various sources and was not allocated by the government. Based on this fact, we cannot help but admit that the government has only drawn a big cake for the disaster relief work, asking the disaster victims to take it and satisfy their hunger.</p>
<p>In addition, there was the Korean expulsion of Chinese incident, the tragic incident of the seizure of the Northeast, and the Tianjin unrest. The losses from all kinds of disasters are even more impossible to calculate. In short, at present, when we look around our country, it is truly full of devastation. East, west, south, north, there is not a single clean piece of land. "The people suffer deeply." We cannot help but utter such a moan in this painful reality, and we cannot help but stroke the wounds all over our bodies and cry out loudly. Can this tragic moan and painful cry be blown into the ears of the party and government leaders with the wind?</p>
<p>The year 1931 was indeed a year of great hardship and calamity for us. However, when we reach the end of the desperate road, who dares to say that a new world will not unfold? Will China forever be a "country of famine"? Will it forever be unable to enter the realm of a "modern country"? We will never believe it. We should shout loudly, "Roar, you ancient China! Rise up, you weaklings who have fallen into the abyss of suffering! New hope will be presented to us with the year 1932."</p>
<h3>Important Domestic Telegrams II</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Tianjin states that the situation on the Panshan front of the Yingkou Line is critical. The Northeast Army is currently using armored vehicles as the front line and digging solid temporary trenches along the railway to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. The Northeast People's Self-Defense Volunteer Army telegraphed the British Embassy and other embassies on the evening of the 27th, saying, "If the Japanese army and the bandits instructed by the Japanese army come to invade, we will resolutely resist." It is expected that there will be a major battle in that area. (United Press Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Amano Brigade departed from Yingkou yesterday morning and entered Tianzhuangtai across the Liao River at 5:00 PM. The attack will begin at dawn. Also, a certain alliance here also departed for Tianzhuangtai late at night. (United Press Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The method used by the Japanese army on the Yingkou-Goubangzi Railway to clear out bandits and irregular Chinese soldiers is the usual one: a swift and fierce attack to prevent the enemy from having any rest. The Japanese army began the attack at dawn this morning. The headquarters of the Domen Command, commanded by the commander of the Second Division, Domen, is located in Tianzhuangtai. According to the message submitted this afternoon, several Japanese planes carrying bombs are now assisting the mixed brigade led by Amano, advancing forward until Goubangzi. It was found that when the Japanese army attacked Ma Zhanshan's troops on the Nenjiang front two days ago, they traveled 23 miles in ten hours, fighting and advancing, regardless of hunger and cold. The same method is still used today. It is thought that the speed of the Japanese army's advance on the Goubangzi line will not be inferior to its actions within Qiqihar. According to the latest news, the Japanese army engaged in combat with irregular Chinese troops at Zhengjiatun, six kilometers northwest of Tianzhuangtai, after 10:00 AM this morning. It is reported that the Chinese army suffered heavy losses and is gradually retreating north. The Japanese have occupied Sanchaizi and Madao. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Withdraws from Faku</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Jinzhou states that the Japanese army in Faku withdrew on the night of the 26th due to the resistance of the local militia and headed north to Kangping. The morale in Kangping is high, and people are rising up to defend themselves. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Cables Ping Requesting Assistance</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Ping, stating that he had completed his inspection of Baiquan and returned to Haihou, where he convened meetings of military officers for several days to discuss counter-attack plans, and requested assistance with military pay and ammunition to divert the Japanese army's offensive against Jinzhou. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Zhanshan has sent Party Committee member Hu Huanzhang to Beijing to thank the fellow villagers' association and report to the central government on the progress of the Party army's operations and its future attitude and preparations. Hu has departed and will arrive within a few days. (Central News Agency Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan Covers Its Ears and Steals a Bell</h3>
<p>Talks by Inukai Tsuyoshi</p>
<p>On the One Hand, Consolidating the Military's Power in Manchuria</p>
<p>On the Other Hand, Deceiving Various Countries with the Open Door Policy</p>
<p>(Oriental) Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi told reporters today that even if Manchuria were given to Japan as a gift, Japan would not want to accept it, because Manchuria has a very wide border and the defense costs are extremely high. What Japan wants in Manchuria is to protect its treaty rights. Many Europeans and Americans seem to have a misunderstanding that the purpose of the Japanese army's actions west of Shenyang is quite regrettable. They do not know that Chinese soldiers and bandits are often mixed and indistinguishable, and soldiers can become bandits, and bandits can become soldiers. Reuters has learned that the Japanese government will soon publish an article reaffirming the policy of open door and equal opportunity in Manchuria. This article is a response because the US Ambassador to Japan met with Inukai Tsuyoshi on December 24 to accuse the Japanese army authorities in Shenyang of interfering with foreign business. It is said that Inukai Tsuyoshi replied at the time that the Japanese government sympathetically accepted this protest, but asked the US Ambassador to understand that the current extraordinary situation made it necessary to temporarily interfere with trade. The Japanese Prime Minister agreed to two things: (1) Japan has no intention of occupying Manchuria; (2) Japan's open door policy welcomes foreigners to participate in Manchurian affairs when normal conditions are restored. The Japanese Prime Minister also said that after peace and order are restored, the Japanese and foreigners will definitely have even greater opportunities than before. It is said that the US Ambassador had previously met with Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara to protest the open door issue in Manchuria, but the issue was temporarily shelved due to the cabinet reshuffle. It is also said that the Japanese Consul General in Shenyang has declared to foreign consuls that Japan is willing to be responsible for ensuring that the temporary government of Shenyang, after its stable establishment, repays the foreign debts owed by Zhang Xueliang. Japan itself is also preparing to pay for any losses caused by the actions of the Japanese. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military is now determined to take a leading role in national politics related to Asia, and its plan to consolidate the military's power is underway. Some journalists believe that the appointment of Prince Kan'in Kotohito, a close relative of the Japanese Emperor, as Chief of the General Staff is the first step in the military's plan. The second step will be to seek the appointment of former Minister of the Army General Minami as the head of a new administrative agency to coordinate the steps of the Japanese in the three eastern provinces and Korea. The Japanese have long advocated this new administrative agency, the purpose of which is to prevent conflicting measures by the Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, the President of the South Manchuria Railway, the Governor-General of Korea, and the Commander of the Kwantung Army. Recently, the Japanese newspaper discussed Minami's new position in the three eastern provinces, saying that there is a plan to establish a Governor-General of Manchuria and Mongolia, but most knowledgeable people believe that this statement is not necessarily completely reliable, because Japan has repeatedly stated that it has no territorial ambitions. However, if we believe in the military's plan, it intends to set up an administrative agency headed by a military leader, so that the military's主張can occupy the largest force when deciding Japan's policy toward northern Asia. The military has long striven to establish a supreme authority and create a practical plan to consolidate Japan's vested interests in Manchuria and Mongolia. According to military opinion, this supreme authority should of course be under military control, because the responsibility for protecting vested interests will be borne by the military. Japanese soldiers may also be preparing for war with Russia at this time, which is also one of their considerations, because Japan's expansion of its rights and interests in northern Asia will sooner or later lead to conflict with Soviet Russia. Therefore, the military is eager to consolidate its power in the three eastern provinces and Korea as a future military deployment. The current Seiyukai cabinet seems willing to give the military more freedom, so the military's plan may succeed. It is said that Honjo has established a temporary agency in the three eastern provinces in preparation for establishing a plan to consolidate Japanese interests under military control. This temporary agency may be the forerunner of the permanent agency that Minami wants to establish in the future. (Kokumin News Agency Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Eastern Provinces Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Totaling Between 45,000</p>
<p>Exceeding the Scope Permitted by the Treaty</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The troops from Himeji, Japan, having just arrived in Shenyang, departed for the front line today. The destination is strictly kept secret. Most of the Japanese planes stationed in Shenyang a few days ago have already left, and their new base is also kept secret. The Japanese army departing from Korea will arrive in Liaoning within one or two days. The actions of the Japanese army in southern Liaoning are always extremely secretive. Even if news of troop movements is released, the unit numbers, destinations, and purposes of departure are not disclosed. Only a few announcements have been made about the number of newly arrived reinforcements and their destinations. It is now estimated that there are between 40,000 and 50,000 Japanese troops in Manchuria. According to the treaty, the maximum number of troops stationed on the South Manchurian Railway should not exceed 15,000. (Kokumin Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Three Thousand Chinese and Japanese Soldiers Killed in the Heihe Battle</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to Japanese sources, 3,000 Japanese soldiers died in the Heilongjiang battle. They were all packed into hemp sacks and forced Chinese to transport them to Shenyang. When someone asked, the Japanese told them that they were beef. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Zhao Xinbo Has the Ambition to Become Governor</h3>
<p>Jin Ao'an Is Still Under Japanese Surveillance</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shenyang News: Yuan Jinkai, Zhao Xinbo, and Ding Jianxiu have formed a triangular force, fighting fiercely in secret. Zhao's backer is the Japanese military, Ding's backer is the South Manchuria Railway, and Yuan is supported by Yu Chonghan. Each seizes political power. The downfall of the Diweihui and the return of Zang are all Zhao's machinations. Zang is still in transition, and Zhao Xinbo will be the future governor. Zang is completely unfree. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shenyang News: Jin Ao'an is still under Japanese surveillance. The Japanese are forcing him to take over as Director of Education as a condition for restoring his freedom. Merchants in the city are prohibited from closing their doors early. Japanese military police are inspecting pedestrians more strictly. Recently, Japanese ronin, military police, and Chinese ruffians have been setting up ways to extort money everywhere. One hundred and fifty Japanese soldiers engaged in combat with bandits in Niuzhuang. All the Japanese soldiers were killed, and firearms and two small cannons were looted by the bandits. The Japanese are quite wary of the bandits. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Stationed in Tianjin Prepares for Live-Fire Drill</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consul Notifies the Municipal Government</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Consul in Tianjin notified the Municipal Government by telephone on the 28th, saying that the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin would conduct a live-fire drill at Dongjuzi Saidan from the 29th to January 3rd every day, and that in the future, the Japanese troops would no longer give prior notice of target practice or drills, and that Chinese newspapers must not publish articles about Japanese troops crossing the border for target practice or drills, and that if plainclothes teams occur in the future, they must not be said to be related to Japan. (Special Telegram, 38th)</p>
<h3>The US Government Receives Japan's Reply</h3>
<p>Clearly Violating Its Promises</p>
<p>The United States Expresses Deep Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>The United States Will Hold a Large-Scale Pacific Maneuver Next Year</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department today received Japan's reply to the US protest against the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou. It is currently being translated and will be sent to Secretary of State Stimson's residence on Sunday afternoon. The authorities are currently refusing to discuss the Japanese reply with the press. It is said that the United States seems to be dissatisfied with the reply, as Japan has clearly refused to abide by its promises made before the League of Nations Council. It is expected here that Japan will continue to fight against the Chinese army in the three eastern provinces, regardless of the attitude of the great powers. The authorities are currently paying close attention to the latest news from the Jinzhou area, but still hope that the dispute between China and Japan over the Liaoning case can be resolved soon. According to reports, since the United States, Britain, and France protested against the Japanese army's activities near Jinzhou last week, the authorities announced that the 1932 US naval maneuver will still be held in the Pacific, not in the Atlantic. However, according to well-informed sources, this move has no political effect. (Kokumin Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government received a notice from the Japanese government today that military operations in the Jinzhou area will continue. The US government remained silent, but diplomatic sources said that this document simply proves that the Japanese government intends to complete the conquest of Manchuria.

<h3>Inukai Tsuyoshi Sends Personnel to Beijing to Visit Old Friends</h3>
<p>Although There Were Many Conversations</p>
<p>It Is By No Means A Negotiation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Important news: Inukai Tsuyoshi sent Kayano Nagachika to Beijing, ostensibly in a personal capacity, to visit old friends in the Kuomintang. Although there were many conversations, it was by no means a negotiation. European and American people here believe that a new path has emerged for the Northeast issue, but the party and government believe that the people are extremely strict in supervising the handling of the Northeast issue in Sino-Japanese negotiations, and it must be carefully considered before starting.

<p>(Jinan) The armored train from Beiping opened at 10:45 this morning to Pukou, clearing the way for Feng's special train. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 11:30 PM on the 27th, Feng's special train arrived in Jinan. Han Fuju and other military and political dignitaries all went to the station to welcome him. Feng got off the train and shook hands with everyone. He first watched the station team and repeatedly said "Good." Feng said that military training is the foundation, writing well, and speaking well. Foreign devils are useless. He then took a car with Han Fuju to the provincial government, met with his old subordinates, and talked to reporters. He advocated active preparations for war and the use of force to recover lost territory externally, and sincere unity internally. He said that the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee will definitely have good results. He said that he was not sure how many days he would stay in Beijing. When he came to Shandong in the future, he heard that Han's training team was working very hard. When he got off the train in Dezhou, he saw that the officers and soldiers were simple and hardworking, and military training could protect the country and the local area. Because he was tired from the train ride, he decided to go south tomorrow. He said goodbye to the reporters, promising to see them again. Liu Shouzhong came with Feng. Feng wore a blue cotton padded jacket and pants, blue cloth socks, single-faced cotton shoes, a brimless felt hat, a blue cloth open coat, and a dark blue cloth waistband, with long hair and a short beard, completely peasant-like. After arriving at the provincial government, he met with his old subordinates in the Northwest Army in Han's office and asked about them with great enthusiasm. He went to bed in the office at 2:30 this morning and got up at 6:00. He originally planned to inspect the three-way army, but it was canceled due to the snow. At 10:00, Han hosted a banquet for Feng and Liu at the Pearl Spring of the provincial government, inviting Shi Yousan, Cheng Xixian, Li Shuchun, Wen Chenglie, and Wang Fangting, and Xiong Guanmin to accompany them. The meal only consisted of three hot pots, filled with vermicelli and cabbage, and eight small dishes, also only cabbage and tofu, etc. They ate yellow millet wotou, rice, and steamed buns, etc. Han also invited the reporters to attend. Feng, Han, Liu, etc. first took a photo, and then the entire group took a photo together. At 11:30, they left for the station. Han and others saw them off at the station. Feng shook hands with everyone and said goodbye before boarding the train. Just in time, a telegram from the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee welcomed Feng and Liu. Feng ordered Han to reply. At 11:50, the train departed south. Feng had a declaration saying, "Compatriots and comrades, for the sake of going to the national crisis together, I resolutely came to Beijing to attend the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. I hereby present the specific views as follows: (1) Representatives of various civil organizations should promptly organize a National Salvation Conference to supervise all major diplomatic, domestic, and military plans during the national crisis. (2) Establish a National Defense Committee to unify military organization and military command, select elite troops, and allocate them to the front lines and important areas to implement the use of force to recover lost territory. (3) Provide comfort to the martyrs who died in the revolutionary battles of previous years and in the current resistance against Japan to encourage morale. I believe that the above three items are the urgent tasks at hand to save the country. I have already telegraphed a detailed plan to the First Congress of the Central Committee and requested a public decision. I am willing that all my compatriots and comrades in the whole country, adhering to the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's peace, struggle, and save China, work together to promote its realization. Feng Yuxiang, December 26, 2020." (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>

(Special Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Feng Yuxiang's special train passed through Xuzhou from Jinan at 10:00 PM on the 28th, heading for Beijing. Han Fuju sent an armored train to escort him. Those traveling with Feng included Liu Shouzhong, Li Xingzhong, and Fu Gumin. Feng sent a representative, Gao Xinya, to meet with reporters. According to reports, Feng's emergence from retirement was purely for external affairs, advocating active preparations for war and the use of force to recover lost territory. He did not intend to interfere in internal affairs, but advocated national supervision of the government. The Xuzhou National Salvation Association Promoters also sent representatives to visit Feng, asking him to propose to the First Congress of the Central Committee to quickly convene a National Salvation Conference.

<h3>Jinzhou Problem Left to the National Government for Handling</h3>
<p>Xue Duxu Expresses Sentiment</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xue Duxu spoke, stating that Jinzhou is the gateway to North China. If this gateway is lost, the provinces of Peiping, Tianjin, Suiyuan, and Shanxi will have no protection. No matter how brutal the Japanese army is, it should be defended with all strength. Even if the losses are significant, it should not be spared. Only in this way can it be shown that our country still has soldiers and is not a country passively awaiting death. I proposed at the conference that the Japanese invasion of Jinzhou should be resisted. After discussion, it was only handed over to the National Government for serious handling. However, nothing has been heard about how the National Government will handle it. The attending gentlemen, regarding it as a diplomatic issue, should be united in spirit to face the national crisis. The Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou is imminent, yet some people advocated that this case should not be discussed. I do not know what their mentality is. He could not help but sigh.

<h3>British Prime Minister Invites French Prime Minister to Discuss Reparations Issues</h3>

<h3>Czech Blames German Tanner for Causing Trouble in the Guangtian Case</h3>
<p>Claiming That He Was Reckless and Careless</p>
<p>National News Agency, Prague, 17th: The theory that a certain country's diplomatic personnel in Russian capital knew about the assassination of Japanese ambassador Hirota has been confirmed in a semi-official communiqué issued by the Czechoslovakian foreign ministry today. It is said that the diplomatic personnel was Colonel Wanake, who has served in the embassy for many years and was about to be transferred from Moscow to an important position in the capital of a certain European country. After the Czech representative in Russia was notified by the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee, he immediately began to investigate thoroughly and learned that Wanake had discussed the situation in Yuan Dong in a private conversation at a certain informal banquet, and had once made a statement that an attempt to assassinate Hirota's life might cause war disputes, etc. The communiqué also stated that Wanake's words were only a reckless slip of the tongue. After the facts were investigated and clarified, the Czech government immediately recalled Wanake and will now order him to retire. Currently, opinions in Prague on this matter vary. There is now an impression that Wanake has been wronged, because the Soviet Russian secret police heard that Wanake had made these reckless remarks and then pieced together and embellished them to achieve other kinds of effects. Apart from this reckless slip of the tongue, Wanake has always been very cautious and reliable in his official duties, and it is unlikely that he would make such a big mistake in violating diplomatic practices.</p>
<p>Havas, Czech Capital, 27th: According to news received in Czech Capital, Wanake has departed from Moscow and will arrive here on Tuesday. Although the matter is currently shrouded in mystery, it will eventually be clarified after receiving the secretary's report.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Panshan: To all newspaper offices, legal entities, national elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, since the September 18th tragedy, the Japanese have occupied our cities, plundered our property, raped our women, and massacred our compatriots. Outside the South Manchurian Railway, they have ravaged thousands of miles. From Longsha in the north to the Bohai Sea in the south, the land is stained with red blood, and the flames of war light up the sky. Our Northeast people are groaning under the iron hooves of the brutal Japanese for three months now. During this period, our authorities, based on the principle of peace, did not advocate resistance. The Japanese, thinking that our country was weak and easy to deal with, defied the Kellogg-Briand Pact, violated the three resolutions of the League of Nations, and were greedy and insatiable. They used the old trick of annexing Korea and applied it to the Northeast, such as kidnapping Puyi and establishing the Maintenance Association, forcing Zang Shiyi, the puppet, to take the stage. These are clear evidence of seizing political power in the Northeast and occupying Manchuria and Mongolia. Their intentions are known to the world. Moreover, they have used local tyrants and inferior gentry in various counties to fabricate public opinion, organize autonomous associations, disrupt order, dispatch Japanese and Korean thugs, and buy off bandits to harm the local area. All these poisonous plans are nothing more than a pretext for advancing troops and implementing aggression. In the past, Ling Yinqing and Zhang Xucheng instigated chaos in western Liaoning, and Japanese participated in their troops. The Japanese supplied the salary and ammunition. Banditry was frequent on the Beining Line, which also occurred after the Japanese sent troops. However, the Dandong-Tianjin Railway, which is thousands of miles long, has not suffered any banditry. Using this to prove that their actions are at the command of the Japanese. Is it not the Japanese who instigated the bandits in the first place? Then they suppress those bandits, with planes and bombs, indiscriminately slaughtering the innocent and good. Those who are not instigated by them and are not used by them are regarded as bandits. Wherever their iron hooves go, they trample everything. The area between Bai Shan and Hei Shui has become a slaughterhouse for Japanese bandits. Besieged by rain and wind, it is no longer a human world. The authorities are trapped in Jinzhou, never daring to cross the Lei Chi River, ignoring our needs in the depths of water and fire. The public officials of the Party and the state harbor their own private opinions and engage in endless political struggles. The League of Nations, which is supposed to maintain peace, has failed to uphold justice. What are the sins of our people, who have suffered this great calamity? I ask the nations of the world, who in this situation will decide on their own? Our people knock their heads to heaven, seeking a way out, but refuse to wait for death and rise up to defend ourselves. All of us Chinese descendants will never be willing to be slaves of a conquered country. We would rather kill the enemy to death than seek completeness through humiliation. We have organized the Northeast People's Volunteer Army. Anyone who harms us will be resisted with self-defense means, vowing to resist to the death. We must not be humiliated by violence and allow others to slaughter us. Conscience compels us, and there is no turning back. We die for self-defense, we die for the country, and we die for the survival of the nation. Death has more than enough glory. We hope that the people of the country and the wise men of friendly nations will appreciate our sincerity and will not be deceived by the rumors of the Japanese about our uprising. We urgently appeal for your attention. All the members of the Northeast People's Self-Defense Volunteer Army knock and plead for forgiveness.</p>

<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on the 28th, the Central Party Headquarters held the sixth Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Attendees included Central Committee members Sun Ke, Gu Mengyu, Chen Gongbo, Zou Lu, Chen Bijun, Li Wenfan, Li Liejun, Ju Zheng, Fang Shengtao, Ma Chaojun, Chen Mingshu, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, Shao Yuanchong, Yang Shuzhuang, Zeng Zhongming, Chen Zhongfu, Fang Zhenwu, Shang Zhen, He Yaozu, Li Zonghuang, Jiao Yitang, Fang Juehui, Zhang Daofan, Xue Dubi, and over fifty others, as well as staff members from various departments and offices, totaling approximately 600 people. Gu Mengyu presided over the ceremony. After the formalities, Ju Zheng delivered a report, stating that the recent great unity of comrades in the party was due to the influence of the five virtues of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life: gentleness, goodness, respect, frugality, and humility. Throughout the revolutionary process, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Wang Jingwei, and Mr. Hu Hanmin were all able to abide by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and inherit his legacy, dedicating themselves to the National Revolution with a spirit of arduous sacrifice, their contributions should not be forgotten. In the future, these three leaders should unite sincerely and cooperate hand in hand to consolidate the party's center. Currently, the party feels a lack of talent, which prevents the work from being fully effective. In the future, national construction must cherish the party's talent, and those with a specific skill should be strongly protected so that they can be secure in their positions and give full play to their talents. In terms of diplomacy, Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was an old friend of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and had sympathy for the Chinese revolution. If he could abandon the traditional policy of military aggression against China, adopt a friendly and peaceful approach, and work together towards Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, it would be a blessing for both China and Japan. As for the issue of eliminating the Communist Party, relying solely on force is unlikely to be effective. In the past, when the White Wolf bandits were causing trouble, Yuan Shikai used the military forces of several provinces to suppress them for several years, but their remnants were still difficult to completely eliminate. Therefore, the fundamental solution should be to find ways to change their psychology and correct their views. On the one hand, politics should be improved to prevent the people from being driven astray by political oppression. Then, the strength of the Communist Party will naturally decrease, and eventually it can be eliminated.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Attendees included Acting Chairman Lin Sen, officials from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions such as Yu Youren, Shao Yuanchong, Shao Lizi, He Yaozu, Gao Weiyue, Zhu Lilian, and other officials and guests, totaling over 300 people. Lin Sen presided over the ceremony. After the formalities, Shao Yuanchong delivered a report, stating that this was the last memorial week of the 20th year of the Republic of China. Looking back at the achievements of the past, most of them were passive efforts. Due to the constraints of reality, few active achievements were made. The seriousness of domestic and foreign troubles this year is unprecedented. The Chinese Kuomintang, which bears the responsibility of saving the country, is determined to overcome this difficult situation, hence the unity of the whole party this time. In the future, we will concentrate all our efforts to jointly overcome national difficulties. The original manuscript is being organized.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Unwavering Determination</h3>
<p>Refusing the Japanese side's compromise terms</p>
<p>Advising Zhang Jinghui not to take a puppet position</p>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from Harbin on the 17th reported that it had been a week since the Japanese military sent personnel to Hailun to meet with General Ma Zhanshan. However, the conditions proposed by the Japanese side have only now been partially revealed. According to General Ma's personal statement to a Westerner, the conditions proposed by the Japanese were unacceptable to him because they wanted to force him to break away from Nanjing and Beiping. The Japanese stated that if this could be done, they could guarantee that Heilongjiang Province would not be invaded by Chinese troops or other foreign troops, and they could also guarantee the expulsion of all bandits. However, Ma replied that such an act would be treasonous to him and he could not discuss it. Seeing that Ma's loyalty was unwavering and could not be swayed, the Japanese returned to Harbin in disappointment and told Ma that if he could not accept these conditions, the Japanese military would consider him an enemy. However, Ma need not worry about an attack by the Japanese military before next spring. During this cold winter, soldiers cannot hold their guns, making it difficult to use troops. Currently, the cold in Heilongjiang Province is extremely severe, with the thermometer dropping to 44 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. One must wear extremely thick winter clothing and gloves to keep warm. At this time, it is difficult to use firearms. Some say that it is not difficult for the Japanese military to use airplanes to drop bombs. This idea is also incorrect. Airplanes have difficulty flying high in cold weather. Airplanes that can usually fly at an altitude of 7,000 meters cannot fly above 5,000 feet at this time. Even if they fly to an altitude of 5,000 feet, the crew members will have difficulty moving freely. Yesterday morning, a Japanese pilot took off in an airplane in Qiqihar but landed immediately because his hands were frozen stiff in the sky and he could not fly. Therefore, in this environment, it is also impossible for airplanes to drop bombs. Therefore, Ma need not worry about aerial attacks before spring. As for Ma's cavalry, they are accustomed to the cold weather of the north and can still attack the Japanese military at this time. Within the next month, they may attack the Japanese front lines. Ma's headquarters is located in Hailun, and his troops are stationed in various places, all loyal and unwavering. If they receive orders, they will immediately move out. The road from Hailun to Keshan is extremely difficult to travel. Currently, there are bandits everywhere, and even villagers often engage in robbery. Currently, the front lines of the Japanese military and Ma's troops are 50 miles apart, and travel within these 50 miles is even more dangerous. The Japanese military has fortified Qiqihar, and a large airfield has been built on the banks of the Nen River. The sheds for housing airplanes are specially constructed to withstand the cold. The propellers and engines are wrapped in canvas, and Russian-style stoves are placed inside to provide warmth. However, even with these special facilities, it still takes two hours to start the engine. Zhang Jinghui, the Chief Executive of the Special District, once met with Ma Zhanshan, wanting to persuade him to accept the Japanese conditions. It is said that Ma's loyalty is unwavering, believing that accepting the advice of a Japanese advisor would be treason. Zhang was severely reprimanded by General Ma, who also advised Zhang not to go to Heihe to be the chairman. Currently, military funds are being remitted from various parts of the world to support General Ma. Therefore, Ma's troops will definitely be able to hold their defenses at this time and can take the opportunity to harass the Japanese.</p>
<h3>The Disaster of the Harbin-Changchun Newspaper Offices</h3>
<p>International Cooperative Daily is suppressed and suspended</p>
<p>Chenguang and Northeast Daily are also shut down</p>
<p>Changchun Dadong Daily is forced to reorganize</p>
<p>The reason is that they all published anti-Japanese texts</p>
<p>Harbin correspondence: Among the Japanese dailies published in Harbin, the newspapers include International Cooperative Daily, Harbin Gazette, Chenguang Daily, Binjiang Times, Northeast Daily, National Gazette, Harbin News, Donghua Daily, and Dabeixin Daily. There are also small newspapers such as Noon News and Xinxin Daily. Among them, Dabeixin Daily is a purely Chinese character foreign newspaper, the Harbin Gazette is a purely official newspaper of the Chief Executive's Office, and the rest are all commercial in nature, either founded solely by individuals or jointly operated by joint ventures. The International Cooperative Daily, the Gazette, Chenguang Daily, and the National Gazette are the most popular and the oldest. After the outbreak of war in Heilongjiang Province, the International Cooperative Daily recorded in more detail. At the same time, it promoted fundraising to comfort the Heilongjiang army, which won social sympathy, and its circulation increased accordingly. However, the newspaper has recently criticized Zhao Zhongren, a traitor in Heilongjiang Province, without reservation. Zhao then secretly implemented his destructive methods. Some colleagues also jealous of the newspaper's circulation and squeezed it out. Therefore, in the past two months, the newspaper has been in the midst of storms every day. On the 10th of this month, the authorities convened a security conference, mentioned this matter, and immediately decided to seal the newspaper. Fortunately, a certain important person interceded, saying that the newspaper is the center of public opinion. Even if it is slightly wrong, in order to maintain social stability and public opinion, it should not be sealed off immediately. The proposal to seal the newspaper was thus rejected. A few days ago, the Japanese Consulate also requested the authorities to ban the newspaper on the grounds that its anti-Japanese remarks were too radical and detrimental to diplomatic relations. The authorities were struggling to find a reason to deal with it, so they decided to order the newspaper to suspend publication. However, in order to avoid criticism from foreign countries, they did not issue a formal order, but secretly instructed the Special Police Management Office to suggest that the newspaper suspend publication on its own initiative. On the 22nd of this month, the newspaper heard this news and sent personnel to the Management Office to inquire about the truth. It then decided to publish an announcement on the 23rd to suspend publication first, and at the same time dredge the authorities and resume publication. The newspaper's Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, Zhao Daiwen, and Liu Shouzhong took a photo when they met at Lanchun Jinshan Middle School north of Taiyuan on the 23rd of this month (the meeting situation is seen in yesterday's newspaper).</p>
<p>From right to left: (1) Yan Xishan (2) Liu Shouzhong (3) Zhao Daiwen (4) Feng Yuxiang</p>
<p>The announcement reads: "Our newspaper is currently in a very difficult situation due to the current situation. At the same time, the printing machinery suddenly malfunctioned due to rushing to print the annual report. Therefore, it is decided to temporarily suspend publication from tomorrow. Once the printing machinery is repaired within a few days, it will be published and meet with readers again. During this period, all debts and external debts of our newspaper will still be handled as usual, and the responsible personnel will remain unchanged. In order to prevent misunderstandings from the outside world, a solemn statement is hereby made." Today, many people in Harbin sent letters to the newspaper expressing their regret. It is said that the newspaper's president, Zhang Fusheng, is currently making every effort to dredge. If the progress is smooth, it will be possible to resume publication on New Year's Day next year. However, it is expected that the tone of future comments will no longer be as strict as before. The Northeast Daily also suffered the same fate as the newspaper. It was ordered to suspend publication because it recorded news incautiously and angered the authorities. Zhao Zhongren wants to take over the newspaper and is currently planning it. Chenguang Daily was taken over by Zhang Shuping, the former person in charge of the newspaper, who was sent by Zhang Jinghui due to internal disputes. It has been published today.</p>
<p>Changchun correspondence: The Dadong Daily, which was founded solely by Huo Zhanyi, has been published in Changchun for five years. Although its circulation is not large, it is highly valued by the people of Changchun. In the past, the newspaper published many anti-Japanese remarks, which were hated by the Japanese side. After the fall of Changchun, the Japanese Consulate arrested its editor, Fu Pengnian, and destroyed its machinery. Under the command of the Japanese Consulate, the newspaper was forced to resume publication, and the manuscripts had to be submitted for inspection before being published, so that the newspaper became a Japanese propaganda machine. It has been three months. Recently, the Japanese side has been dissatisfied that the newspaper sometimes does not obey orders and publishes news that is not beneficial to Japan. On the 19th of this month, the Japanese Consulate suddenly sent a staff member, the Japanese Kawanishi Tadaka, to be the newspaper's advisor, and ordered the newspaper to be reorganized into the Dadong Evening News, claiming that Huo Zhanyi had dealings with the old regime and dismissing him as president. Fu Pengnian was appointed as president, and several Japanese were assigned as editors. All the important personnel of the old company were dismissed. Therefore, the newspaper has been completely transformed into a Chinese character foreign newspaper. (Evening of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Dispute over the Suspension of the Construction of the Memorial Monument: The County Party Department previously resolved to build a Dr. Sun Yat-sen memorial monument on the site of Yueming City in Ximen, and submitted it to the Construction Department through the county, which transferred it to the Construction Bureau for design and drawing and submitted it for approval. However, this construction requires the necessary use of a part of the former camp site of the Wu family. Other sites, such as the site of Pandao Xingyu Jewelry Store, were also resolved by the county government to be exchanged for the camp site next to the Xiyuan Bathhouse. Later, the Wu family refused to accept it and petitioned the province, causing the case to be suspended for years and has not been concluded. The Dr. Sun Yat-sen memorial monument is still not under construction. Now that the Wu family has built a building by the roadside, occupying a part of the base of the city wall, Pan Wanxing, Pan Yunqing also submitted a request to the county government to assist in the construction to avoid losing their land. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Shen stated that the issue of the location of the memorial monument in this case had been submitted to the province for approval. Now that there is no instruction, how can the Wu family start construction without waiting for orders? It is very inappropriate. The Construction Bureau has been instructed to transfer a letter to the County Public Security Bureau to stop it. Wu Boyang also telegraphed the provincial government, requesting a construction permit for the people from the Construction Bureau, but was suddenly stopped by the county magistrate. Please give a quick telegram to stop it. The provincial government replied that the construction should be stopped before it is approved by the Construction Department to avoid disputes. Please be informed.</p>
<p>Songjin Gentry Requests to Transfer Cao Regiment Back: Songjin gentry Yin Shisheng, Liu Shiji presented a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Security Office requesting to transfer the Second Regiment headquarters back. The report roughly stated that Songjin is located by the lake and sea, a key area of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Bandits are rampant, especially in winter. Since Cao Xiexia, the commander of the Second Regiment of the Provincial Security Infantry, was stationed in Songjiang last year, he has repeatedly annihilated major bandits and arrested chief culprits. However, on the 7th of this month, the unit suddenly received an order to move to Chongming. Most of the important officials have departed, leaving only a battalion to guard the Jinshanwei coast defense and a battalion stationed in Zhujiajiao, Qingpu. The citizens were deeply shocked and frightened. After the unit left Songjiang, although it has not been many days, incidents have occurred frequently and crises are looming. Songjiang is an important town in the east and west, with a vast territory and many bandits. Moreover, pirates are also eager to move and take the opportunity to enter. Therefore, we earnestly request that you quickly instruct Commander Cao to lead his troops back to Songjiang immediately so that they can be familiar with the situation and provide security. This is our earnest prayer.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Cross-country Race Changes Route: The third New Year's Day public cross-country race held at the Wuxian Public Sports Ground was originally scheduled to start from Guangji Bridge, go to Ruifeng Yarn Factory on Erma Road, and return to Guangji Bridge as the finish line. Now, because it is during the anti-Japanese period, Erma Road is close to the Japanese Concession, which may cause misunderstandings. Therefore, the route has been changed to the Gantang Bridge pier and then back to Guangji Bridge. It is also heard that more than 40 people have joined this time and are collecting prizes from all walks of life to encourage participation.</p>
<p>All Circles Petition to Cancel the Additional Land Price Tax: Qian Jieyi from the agricultural sector, Shi Kuihe from the Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Jianchu from the church, Dan Zhen from the asset management office, and Ding Peng from the warehouse association and other five organizations jointly presented a report to the Yuan, ministries, and government, stating that this year's flood was extremely severe. Continuing to levy additional land price taxes is beyond the people's ability. Please grant a clear order to cancel it in order to show great faith and alleviate Suzhou's difficulties.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Robber of Gold Ornaments Executed: At around 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month, a vagrant named Chen Yikang (also known as Li Dagang) snatched two gold rings from the Licheng Gold Shop on Main Street in the city and jumped over the city wall to outside the West Gate. He was arrested by the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the Huishan Fifth Regiment headquarters by the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Yesterday, the 28th, at around 5:00 PM, Regiment Commander Liang Zuoxun sentenced him to death in accordance with the law on punishing bandits and immediately dispatched a team to escort the criminal to an open space under the train and execute him by shooting. It is heard that Chen was 20 years old and from Wuping County, Guangdong.</p>
<p>Seventh Branch Seizes a Large Batch of Opium: Wang Weiqing, a villager from Jiejing Port, the border area between Wu and Xi, purchased six pieces of red soil (opium) weighing fifty to sixty taels in Shanghai a few days ago. He took a boat from Shanghai to Xinqiao Port in the county and transported it into a small boat to go elsewhere. He was spotted by Wang Xicheng, the No. 3 patrol officer of the Second Team of the Sixth Water Police Team, who, together with the chief police officer of the Seventh Branch of the Public Security Bureau, went forward and seized the opium and detained Wang Weiqing. Hui Haoqian, the chief of the branch bureau, held a preliminary interrogation in court. Wang confessed that the opium was entrusted to him by a friend to bring back. After obtaining the confession, Chief Hui submitted a document yesterday along with the evidence to the County Public Security Bureau and transferred it to the court for trial. A young woman from a red pill (heroin) organization under Gu Bridge at Beizhakou outside the North Gate transported 60,000 Guo Fusheng red pills back from Shanghai yesterday. When she was passing near Lihuazhuang, she was robbed by street hooligans Dai and You, suffering a great loss. It is now heard that the young woman has prepared money to redeem the pills from Dai and others.</p>
<p>A Black Night Encountered by a Shipping Boat in Houtai: Houtai Town, Taibo City, in the 12th district of the county, has always had a night shipping boat traveling between the city and the countryside. The boat owner, Zou Zengfu, set sail as usual at around 7:00 PM a few days ago. Unexpectedly, when he was passing Maotang Bridge and Lijian Bridge near Meicun in the 10th district, a boat resembling a small gunboat suddenly came along and more than ten burly men jumped out, each holding a rifle and ordering the boat to stop. After more than ten burly men boarded the boat, they overturned it and searched it thoroughly for about half an hour before jumping back to their original boat with their stolen goods and fleeing quickly. After checking the losses, it was found that 576.4 yuan in silver dollars entrusted by Shen Yongyi of Houtai to Wang Yiyuan of Beidang and others had been robbed. Yesterday, a loss report was submitted to the bureau requesting an investigation.</p>

In the evening, the First District Party Department convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members of each district party department and directly subordinate branch. The executive and supervisory committee members of the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth District Party Departments and one directly subordinate district branch, fourteen people in total, attended.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Embezzlement Case of the Chief Engineer of the Highway Bureau: The case of Sun Shiqin, the former chief engineer of the Highway Bureau of the Construction Department, Shao Fengqi, the chief accountant, and eleven others embezzling public funds has been investigated and concluded by the court and a public prosecution has been filed with the Criminal Division. It is heard that Judge Yang of the Criminal Division is very cautious about this case and personally interrogated the defendants and is still studying the facts and the testimonies of each person. The date of the public trial is said to be around January 10. However, after receiving the indictment, the defendant Sun Baoqin has hired lawyer Tao Rong to prepare to defend him in court.</p>
<p>Each District Requests to Advance the Investigation and Release of Winter Relief Funds: The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association previously appointed Jiao Yeshan as the director of the Zhenjiang County Winter Relief Investigation and Release. Mr. Jiao has now arrived in Zhenjiang. Regarding the progress of the steps, he is consulting with the county government to coordinate the efforts. Each disaster-stricken district has submitted a report to the county, requesting to advance the investigation and release of funds. The county government has forwarded the letter to Mr. Jiao to start the process. It is found that the Zhenjiang winter relief funds were previously set by the Relief Association at 8,000 silver dollars. Mr. Jiao has requested a prompt allocation. Once received, he will work with the county government to instruct each district to send a roster of the poorest households among the disaster victims and distribute the funds equally. However, this relief fund is very small and insufficient for the large number of disaster victims in the county. The charitable organizations in Zhenjiang, such as Zhengxin Hall, Yushan Hall, Jingxinxuan Red Swastika Society, etc., have always prepared and organized the distribution of rice, porridge, winter clothing, and all kinds of poverty alleviation efforts every winter. This year, due to the large disaster area, fundraising is more difficult and they have not yet been held, which has caused great eagerness among the poor. I deeply hope that the local gentry will provide more assistance.</p>
<p>Tong Jiasheng's Appeal Still Upheld the Original Judgment: Tong Jiasheng, the former district chief of the Second District of the county, was sued by Yang Xiwen in court for dereliction of duty and fraud and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Tong refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal. After the interrogation was completed, the judgment was still upheld.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Forging Official Documents for Extortion Arrested: Meng Gao, a resident of Shaobo Town in our county, has lived in the town for many years and has some savings. A few days ago, several strangers forged official documents from the Jiangdu Police Brigade and went to extort him. After being reported by the responsible Public Security Eighth Branch, police were dispatched to arrest a suspect named Jiang. He was immediately taken to the bureau and interrogated briefly. He has now been sent to the city along with the plaintiff Meng Gao and Ma Changfa for review by the General Bureau.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Burial of Opium and Embezzlement Case to be Investigated Thoroughly by Zhenjiang: The Nantong County Court burned opium and found 14.5 catties of counterfeit opium on the spot, and there was a shortage of more than 1,000 taels. All circles were in uproar and presented a report to the High Court for a thorough investigation. The court has sent delegates to Nantong for investigation twice, but there is still no result. The County Court has been ordered to transfer the case to the Zhenjiang District Court for a thorough investigation. The opium and documents involved in the fraud were sent to the Zhenjiang District Court on the 26th.</p>
<p>Red and White Pills Spread to Jiangbei: The opium ban has been relaxed in the counties of Tong, Ru, and Hai in Jiangbei, and the sale of red and white pills is particularly smooth, causing endless harm. It is also heard that there are manufacturing organizations in Tongcheng that sell to smoking dens in large numbers.</p>
<p>San Yu Tax Team Leader Executes Without Authorization: Li Xiezheng, the leader of the Huainan Tax Police Team stationed in Sanyu, caused trouble by investigating salt and opened fire, executing villagers without authorization, arousing public anger. He was arrested and sent to the county government and then transferred to the court for interrogation, and was held in a detention center. The team claimed that the incident was caused by salt smugglers and requested Li's release, but it was not approved. The prosecutor's office has filed a public prosecution.</p>
<p>Tonghai Homespun Fabric Industry in Dire Straits: This year, the Tonghai homespun fabric industry has been hit by the fall of eastern provinces. The number of fabrics sold is less than 40,000 rolls, and it is also difficult to collect accounts. Recently, various customs houses have been unable to maintain their operations, and the weaving households in the surrounding villages have also stopped weaving. The homespun fabric industry is now in a dire straits.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Maintains Finance: The Tongcheng silver root is extremely tight, and since the collapse of the Yongchang Lin Money Shop, silver and money industries in Shanghai have been crowding into various shops for cash, causing the financial market to collapse. All depositors, upon hearing the news, immediately withdrew their money, making it more difficult to maintain the market. The Chamber of Commerce has been urging banks and representatives of the Shanghai financial industry for days to jointly discuss the aftermath and has agreed on maintenance measures to jointly overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>Investigating and Arresting Those Who Disrupt the Market: All money shops in Nantong have recently been approaching danger, and notices of clearing accounts and suspending business have been found in front of various large and small shops, causing great turmoil in the market. The Public Security Bureau found that someone was deliberately disrupting the market. These notices were posted privately in the early morning and have been strictly investigated and arrested.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Provincial Order to Thoroughly Investigate Disputes in the Education Circle: The provincial government believes that the educational circle in this county is becoming increasingly noisy, which hinders the development of education. It has ordered County Magistrate Qian to conduct a thorough investigation, distinguish between the leaders and followers, and submit a special report within half a month without any favoritism. The Education Department also previously appointed County Magistrate Qian to serve concurrently as the Director of the Education Bureau, and he will report to the bureau within days to take over his duties.</p>
<p>Financial Panic and Issuance of Promissory Notes: The county's Finance Bureau believes that the fiscal resources are not strong and funds are exhausted, making it difficult to cope with the situation. During the winter solstice of the lunar calendar, it submitted a request to the county government for approval to issue 50,000 yuan in promissory notes and is now planning to continue issuing them to adjust the funds.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan</h3>
<p>The Tragic Situation of Wuyuan County Being Captured by Bandits. On the 7th of this month, as dawn was breaking, over a thousand bandits attacked and captured Wuyuan city. A subsequent investigation revealed that many bandits had secretly entered the city at night using ladders, lying in wait to act as internal support. As dawn approached, gunfire erupted, and the city gates were breached. The patrol guards were defeated. In the streets and alleys, members of the Bandit Suppression Vanguard Team, each carrying sharp weapons, rushed back and forth, shouting and racing. The residents were awakened from their dreams, their situation indescribable. At that moment, the garrison troops and the local defense corps rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm, firing multiple volleys. The bandits on all sides charged forward with unstoppable force. The police and the mobilized civilians were unable to resist and retreated out of the city. Bandit squads, upon entering the county government, broke open the jail and released the prisoners. They also ordered the Vanguard Team to loot and kill indiscriminately. Before leaving, they kidnapped many laborers and even abducted the Catholic priest. The residents' losses exceeded sixty thousand yuan. The sound of mourning shook the heavens and the earth, unbearable to hear. The area was originally garrisoned by troops, but they had been transferred elsewhere, leaving the local defenses empty. County Magistrate Qi Qingchi, with foresight, had packed his luggage and taken his family to the provincial capital several days earlier, hoping to be transferred elsewhere, disregarding the lives of the local people. Now that the area has been plundered, the official documents and grain records of the government have been burned along with the county office. It is unknown what the authorities will do.</p>
<p>Important Education News</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Middle Schools Reopened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Students of middle and higher schools in Hangzhou, since the student union decided last week to resume classes and collectively set off to raise national salvation funds, had been collecting donations in this city before last Wednesday, and in other cities after Wednesday. This ended last Sunday. It is reported that the results of this fundraising were quite impressive. Yesterday, the student union decided to notify all schools that students of all schools will resume classes uniformly starting from Monday, the 28th.</p>
<h3>Shao Peizi No Longer to Head Zhejiang University</h3>
<p>No One Responsible for University Affairs to This Day</p>
<p>Shao Peizi, the president of Zhejiang University, was forced to resign from his position last month due to criticism from students. He submitted his resignation five times in writing and once in person, but none were approved. After being unable to return to Hangzhou, Shao focused on managing the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, as his resignation only pertained to the position of university president and not to the position of dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Since submitting his resignation, Shao has not been seen at Zhejiang University. Currently, university affairs are being handled independently by each college, and everything is proceeding as usual. A few weeks ago, students destroyed the provincial party headquarters. Li Ximou, the dean of the College of Engineering, and Xu Xuan, the dean of the College of Science, submitted their resignations to the central government, with Shao also being listed. However, the Ministry of Education issued instructions that these were unnecessary and ordered President Shao to inform the deans of the colleges. From this, it can be seen that the central government never approved Shao's resignation. However, Shao insisted vehemently and refused to resume the position of university president.</p>

<h3>Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee Decides to Establish University Scholarship</h3>
<p>The Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee held its eighth meeting of the Chinese delegation at 408 Avenue Albert. The committee members present were Chu Minyi, Zeng Zongjian, Li Zhaohuan, Zhu Shijin, and Lei Xiaocen. Those present were Secretary Liu Xichang and Assistants Nong Ruhui and Tian Shoucheng. Chu Minyi chaired the meeting. First, the chairman reported on a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs notifying the reorganization of the Belgian delegation and the list of members after the reorganization, as well as the work of the Standing Committee of the Committee. Then, the meeting discussed the plan to establish a university thesis scholarship, which was proposed by Committee Member Li Zhaohuan. The plan proposed that the Chinese delegation allocate three thousand yuan annually to solicit essays on designated topics and award scholarships to those with outstanding achievements. However, this scholarship is limited to students of domestic universities. The regulations and detailed rules for the thesis scholarship were revised and approved by the delegation meeting.

<h3>Chen Mingshu Expresses Apology to Shanghai Student Union for the January 18th Tragedy</h3>
<p>(Zhonghua News Agency) After the tragic January 18th incident occurred during the demonstration in Beijing by students from various universities in this city, all the students returned to Shanghai. The Anti-Japanese United Association of University Students decided to send two representatives from each school to form a delegation to negotiate in Beijing. In addition to making requests regarding internal affairs and foreign affairs, the delegation also requested that the government express its apology to the people regarding the tragedy. Now, the delegation has returned to Shanghai on the 27th. Regarding the government's apology to the people, Chen Mingshu, the commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, has expressed his apology in writing. The original letter is recorded as follows: To the Shanghai Student Delegation, Greetings. This student movement arose purely from patriotic enthusiasm. The government has always maintained order with the intention of cherishing the youth, which has been understood by all students. However, due to the congestion of people at the time, Mr. Yang Tongheng was unfortunately pushed into the water and died, which has been verified by the court. The coffin has been prepared with due respect. Mr. Yang suffered a tragic death due to his public service, and the government has a responsibility for not providing adequate protection. We express our deep sorrow and regret after the incident. Therefore, we send this special letter to express our apology. We hope for your understanding. Sincerely, Chen Mingshu, Commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison.</p>

<h3>West YMCA Basketball Championships Next Week</h3>
<p>Hujiang Has the Best Chance in Group A</p>
<p>Huzhong and Chenxing Clash in Group B</p>
<p>—Yesterday, Xia Guang Wins, and Jinan Beats Yue Han—</p>
<p>The West YMCA basketball tournament has been going on for a month and a half. Currently, in Group A, Hujiang, Mai Ling, and Haizhe are undefeated. The championship is contested among these three teams. Next week (the eighth week) is the final week of competition, and the matches in each group are extremely important. For example, Hujiang vs. Haizhe and Mai Ling vs. Haizhe are key to the championship and are truly worth watching. The results of yesterday's three matches show that the match between Xia Guang and Jinan was more intense. Results from each match (1) You Tai beats Tongwen (B) 50-10 (2) Xia Guang beats Jinan in Group A 40-34 (3) Yue Han beats Ye Shi in Group A 44-33</p>
<p>Xia Guang beats Jinan During the first half, Jinan's star players Huang Zhaolin and Cai Rongrui did not enter the court, so no one scored. Xia Guang sailed smoothly and won the first half 22-11. In the second half, Jinan's Huang and Cai worked hard and repeatedly scored, gradually approaching the score. They once exceeded Xia Guang 29-27, but like a flash in the pan, they were immediately overshadowed by Xia Guang. Although Jinan tried hard again, Xia Guang was heavily guarded, and it was difficult to achieve anything. As a result, Xia Guang won 45-34.</p>
<p>Yue Han beats Yeshi At the beginning of the Yue Han vs. Yeshi match, Yue Han took the lead. Yeshi was unwilling to be outdone, working together to resist. The situation was quite tense, and the score was once tied at 14-14. Yue Han reorganized its army, demonstrating its ambition and winning the first half 17-14. After a break and re-battle, Yue Han's Miao Lianen and Cheng Jingxing scored nine points in a row, increasing their momentum. Yeshi fought hard, and Tong Wenyuan made many contributions. Both sides fought fiercely, giving excellent performances. As a result, Yue Han won 44-33.</p>

And you are near at hand, so you cannot escape the responsibility of the people of the country. We hope that you will follow the example of General Ma Zhanshan, automatically send troops to aid Jinzhou. The people of the country will also assist you as they assist General Ma.

<h3>Disturbances Occurred at the Shanghai West Daxin Dyeing Factory Yesterday</h3>
<p>Factory Forces Workers to Leave</p>
<p>All Workers Held a Major Petition Yesterday</p>
<p>The Daxin Dyeing Factory on Binlang Road, Xiaoshadu, Shanghai West, announced its closure on October 19th due to problems with raw materials. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau mediated several times without success and submitted it to the Municipal Government for arbitration. All the workers still lived in the factory. Yesterday morning, the factory forcibly drove the workers out, causing disturbances. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Forced to Leave Factory: At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Daxin Factory requested two armed Chinese detectives and Western constables from the Gordon Road Police Station to forcibly drive all the workers out of the factory. Worker representative Li Renkang and others explained to the Chinese detectives, but the police refused to accept and ordered everyone to leave the factory within five minutes. All the workers refused to leave because they had not received orders from the labor union. At 10:30 AM, the police station sent more than 40 armed Chinese and Western detectives to forcibly drive them out of the factory. At that time, the workers Yang Fuqing, Xu Shiqing, Zhu Xiangyun, and others were seriously injured, and workers Xie Shengxiang and others were slightly injured.</p>
<p>Collective Petition: Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, all the workers used removal trucks to transport more than 20 workers who had been seriously and slightly injured to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Chinese Nationalist Party on Lin Yin Road, West Gate, and held a large-scale petition, demanding (1) that the factory immediately resume operations, (2) that the instigators Shao Zhongying and Que Pingzhi be severely punished, and (3) that the dead be given preferential treatment, and the injured be compensated for medical expenses and all losses. Zhou Lianze of the Civil Training Section received them and promised to accept their demands completely. Subsequently, they went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition.</p>
<p>Injuries: The injured workers Yang Fuqing, Xu Shiqing, Zhu Xiangyun, and others were sent to Nanyang Hospital, South Gate, by the Municipal Party Headquarters. It is heard that Yang's injuries are in the lungs and abdomen and are quite serious, and his life is in danger. Xu's injury is in the waist and is also quite serious, but there may be no danger to his life. Zhu's injury is in the head and is not very serious. The slightly injured worker Xie Shengxiang returned to seek medical treatment on his own.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: The Silk Guang Office of the Dyeing Industry Labor Union, in response to the violent and illegal expulsion and beating of workers at the Daxin Factory, has specifically scheduled an emergency meeting of all silk and Guang factory workers in the city at the Luban Road Silk Guang Office at 6:00 PM today to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Labor Union Declaration: To all labor unions in the city, it is a fact that the Daxin Silk Guang Dyeing Factory, which opened on Binlang Road, Xiaoshadu, announced its closure on October 19th due to a lack of raw materials. At that time, our union, based on the factory's letter, believed that although raw materials from Japanese goods were being boycotted, there were still domestically produced yarns to supply, and it was also possible to use goods from the United Kingdom and the United States for relief. There was absolutely no way to actually announce the closure. Moreover, at this time of national crisis, all citizens should resist the violence of Japan with all their strength, especially those engaged in industry and commerce, who should strive to develop production and fundamentally eliminate enemy goods from the market. Therefore, our union requested the factory to resume operations with the utmost enthusiasm. Workers were willing to voluntarily reduce wages and increase work to help the factory reduce its economic burden. In the industrial sector, it can also increase production and development, which is beneficial to both the country and the people. Our union comforted the factory with the utmost sincerity. Unexpectedly, the factory did not understand the workers' difficulties and used the lack of raw materials as an excuse, and also cited the losses in business over the years. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau did not thoroughly investigate the facts of the factory's closure and only discussed giving workers money to dissolve the factory. Our union, under the oppression of the factory and the lack of government protection, still instructed all the workers in the factory to maintain order and await the assistance of the Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government's legal arbitration. Unexpectedly, since February, while the Party and government authorities were conducting a thorough investigation and handling the matter, the factory intensified its actions. Yesterday, it hired dozens of detectives, armed with live ammunition, and ordered all the workers in the factory to be driven out. The workers of the factory refused to leave the factory until the government had properly planned a solution, which led to a major incident. Workers Yang Fuqing and others were seriously injured all over their bodies and were on the verge of death. Now, our union, in addition to fighting to the death, requests the Party and government authorities to quickly plan proper solutions for the dead and injured workers and immediately order the factory to resume operations. We also hope that all friendly associations in the city will give us their full assistance so that we can achieve our goals. We would be extremely grateful. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

<p>Welcome the Arrested Workers Back to the Workshop</p>
<p>After all the workers in the Rihua Yarn Factory cloth machine room in Pudong went on strike, the Japanese colluded with ruffians to forcibly refuse to resume work and continued to suppress and dismiss a large number of workers for no reason. Yesterday, the workers held a general meeting and decided to petition the Social Affairs Bureau today. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Workers' General Meeting: At 3:00 PM yesterday, all the workers held a general meeting at the Rihua branch office in Pudong. First, the chairman reported on the process, and then they began to discuss. It is heard that they resolved (1) to hold a major petition to the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 29th, (2) to demand that the Japanese be strictly ordered not to refuse workers to resume work, (3) otherwise, according to the factory closure method, each person will receive six months' severance pay, (4) to severely punish worker accomplices, (5) to oppose increasing work and reducing wages, (6) to welcome the released workers back to the workshop.</p>
<p>Japanese Plan: The two arrested female workers, Lu Xiaomei and Ni Jinxiu, were released from the local court. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, all the workers welcomed them back to the workshop and set off firecrackers along the way to celebrate. The Municipal Public Security Bureau's Third District Headquarters was notified by the labor union in advance. Since the Japanese refused to allow workers to resume work, they instigated worker accomplices yesterday and recruited new workers to prepare for work. However, all the workers, in view of the Japanese atrocities, were unwilling to break the strike discipline, so no one went.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Company May Resume Work Unconditionally Today</h3>
<p>Armed Protection Yesterday to Force Operations</p>
<p>Ticket Seller No. 1's Court Trial Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Workers Held a Meeting Last Night to Discuss the Approach</p>
<p>After all the ticket sellers of the British Public Bus Company went on strike, the company was protected by armed detectives yesterday and forced to operate Routes 1 and 9. Workers sent representatives to negotiate. It is heard that it has been decided to resume work unconditionally today. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Protected Traffic: In order to maintain traffic, the company was protected by armed detectives sent by the police station yesterday. They forced to operate 14 buses on Route 1 from Jing'an Temple to Laobaizi, 20 A special express buses on Route 9 from Jing'an Temple to Tilanqiao, three B buses, and two C buses. Ticket inspection, writing, and Western plainclothes inspectors served as ticket sellers. They entered the factory early at 10:00 PM and fortunately no conflicts occurred.</p>
<p>General Meeting: All the striking ticket sellers held a workers' general meeting yesterday morning. First, the chairman reported on the process, and then they began to discuss countermeasures against the company. It is heard that they resolved (1) to send six representatives, Nos. 2, 6, 15, 152, 226, and 235, to negotiate directly with the manager of the company, (2) to declare that ticket seller No. 1 is very loyal and to demand that the company bail him out and restore his position, (3) if the above measures are achieved, all the workers will resume work immediately.</p>
<p>Self-Negotiation: Yesterday morning at 3:00 AM, the six representatives elected by all the ticket sellers went to the company on Connaught Road to negotiate with the manager. The manager initially stated that he would terminate the employment contract in accordance with the announcement on the 26th. After negotiation, he agreed to resume work unconditionally. Seeing that the company's attitude was tough, the representatives verbally agreed to resume work unconditionally tomorrow (i.e., this morning).</p>
<p>Court Hearing: Ticket seller No. 1, Zhang Yun, was arrested by the Gordon Road Police Station and taken to the Simple Court of the First Special District Local Court yesterday. Judge Shen Shumu questioned him. First, the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the defendant incited all the ticket sellers to strike on the morning of the 25th and prosecuted him for obstructing freedom in accordance with Article 318 of the Criminal Code. Zhang Yun absolutely denied it. Judge Shen then ordered a continuation of the hearing at a later date.</p>
<p>Company Treatment: Ticket sellers told a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency that the company's treatment has always been oppressive. In the past, old ticket sellers went on strike because they could not bear the oppression, and as a result, they were completely unemployed. This time, we are helping ticket seller No. 1, and the company is imitating the previous method of dismissing all of us. During our service, if we are found to be skimming money from ticket sales, we will be immediately dismissed and punished according to the criminal law. Therefore, all the ticket sellers do not skim money, but the company still slanders the workers. As for the copper coins for ticket sales, the company stipulates 70,000 coins for Route 1, 75,000 coins for Route 2, 73,000 coins for Route 5, 45,000 coins for Routes 6 and 7, 97,000 coins for Route 9, and 88,000 coins for Route 10. If the above regulations are exceeded, they will be rewarded with 40 cents, and 20 cents for driving the bus.</p>
<p>Resume Work Today: After the six representatives negotiated with the manager of the company, they immediately convened a general meeting to report on the negotiation process and discuss solutions. It is heard that two-thirds of the ticket sellers advocated resuming work unconditionally and at the same time trying to bail out the other one-third ticket sellers. They advocated continuing the strike and vowing not to resume work until the goal is achieved. It is heard that the result is to resume work this morning, but it is still unpredictable whether there will be changes before the resumption of work.</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of District Secretaries of the Pharmaceutical Industry Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Officially Established the Reorganization Committee</p>
<p>And Exercises All Powers</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union has been declining due to the incompetence of the two responsible persons, so the workers in the industry have voluntarily organized a reorganization committee and taken over the labor union. However, because the internal organization of the reorganization committee has not been sound, many workers have recently advocated that the reorganization committee needs to be reorganized. In order to accept the will of the masses, the reorganization committee convened a joint meeting of district secretaries at 1:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 secretaries from South Shanghai District, West Shanghai District, French Concession District, Central Shanghai District, American Concession District, Xinzha District, Zhabei District, Pudong District, Wusong District, etc. attended. Fang Qingjian was elected chairman, and Feng Xingkang was the recorder. The meeting proceeded in due form. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, and the secretaries expressed their opinions (omitted). Then, Fang Zheng, Huang Zhisan, Kong Baogen, Hua Qiang, Yi Guifang, Ye Dingzhong, Fang Qingjian, Fang Qinghe, Feng Xingkang, Chen Hezhi, Ye Baozhong, Huang Youxiang, Mu Fusheng, Chen Zancheng, Zhao Xian'an, Wang Kaichun, Ye Xingshou, Lu Zhixiang, Chen Fu, Xu Chubao, Zhao Zhenhui, and other 21 people were elected as reorganization committee members to establish the Shanghai Municipal Pharmaceutical Workers' Nine District Joint Reorganization Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union Committee. Next, the following proposals were passed: (1) This association exercises its powers. From today, it exercises all its powers. If there are labor-capital disputes or labor disputes, this association will be responsible for handling them. Passed. (2) Stop the activities of the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union. Since the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union has been taken over by our workers and is undergoing reorganization, this name can no longer exist, and no one may use this name to carry out activities outside. Passed. (3) The former reorganization committee should handle the handover. The reorganization of the labor union is now the responsibility of this association, and the former reorganization committee should hand over all procedures to this association for handling. Passed. (4) This case of workers joining the industry association. All pharmaceutical workers, whether internal or external, are skilled workers and physical laborers, and there is no reason to join the industry association. Moreover, now that the Central Committee is submitting amendments to the Labor Law and the Factory Law to the First Plenary Session, if the industry association forces them to join, our workers will oppose it to the death. Passed. (5) Employers will dismiss workers by taking advantage of the New Year. Send a letter to warn the industry association that employers must not dismiss workers by taking advantage of the New Year. If any workers are dismissed, they can report to this association immediately, and we will argue reasonably to ensure the safety of their jobs. Passed. (6) Implement the wage increase resolution passed by the previous general membership meeting. The wage increase issue is currently an urgent request of our workers. A resolution was passed at the previous general membership meeting, but it has not yet been implemented. It should be submitted to the employers for request as soon as possible. Passed.</p>
<h3>Petition from Two Postal Unions to Abolish the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau</h3>
<p>Support Postal Services with Postal Economics</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union, in a submission to the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee, appealed to abolish the separately established Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau, to return its functions to the Postal Administration, and to stipulate that postal economics be exclusively used to expand postal services, maintain the postal foundation, and seek postal line development. It is noted that on March 15th of last year, the Ministry of Transportation suddenly divided the postal savings and remittance business, establishing a separate Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau directly under the Ministry of Transportation, standing alongside the Postal Administration. Since the establishment of this bureau, it has disrupted the postal system and undermined postal institutions. While the disadvantages may seem small, the impact on postal economic income and the waste of national public funds are significant. The savings and remittance business is inseparable from postal services; anyone working in the postal service or familiar with its internal operations knows this. Therefore, at the outset of the bureau's separation, the unions repeatedly cried out to salvage the situation, and repeatedly offered modest proposals to the government. Unfortunately, their humble concerns were obscured by the selfish motives of a few, failing to achieve what the unions hoped for. Their sincere loyalty remains a matter of regret to this day. However, it was still hoped that after the establishment of the General Bureau, it would uphold fairness and impartiality, and avoid plunging China's postal service, established for over thirty years, into an irrecoverable state, while providing opportunities for those who sought to profit from it. Unexpectedly, the situation deteriorated and grew worse. Since the establishment of the General Bureau, it has employed non-experts, engaged in secretive administration, created unrealistic plans, and spent lavishly. Previously, when the Postal Administration managed the business, it felt like it was steadily improving and saving twice as much in expenses. With further improvements, it would have made even greater progress. But now, it lacks vitality. Furthermore, after being divided by the General Bureau, the Postal Administration, though nominally coexisting, had its personnel, administration, economy, and various other aspects restricted. This greatly hinders the future of the postal service. Looking back at the historical facts of the past year, one cannot help but feel deeply saddened. The Postal Administration has managed the savings and remittance business for over thirty years, adhering to a strict policy and imposing appropriate restrictions on savings, yet deposits still reached over ten million yuan. The remittance business was managed effectively, with significant progress made. Because it was under the jurisdiction of the Postal Administration itself, operations were extremely convenient, there was no redundant personnel, and the organization was consistent and well-organized. Currently, while savings have also increased under the General Bureau, this increase is due to the elimination of the previous strict policies and the removal of restrictions on deposits. Therefore, while it may appear to be developing on the surface, it is actually a natural phenomenon. As for the remittance business, it is also an annual improvement that is to be expected. Regardless of whether it is managed by the Postal Administration or the General Bureau, the expected progress cannot be said to have only occurred after the division. In short, if one wants to improve the savings and remittance business, one can improve it based on its original state. Why must it be divided and split before speaking of improvement? This is truly because those who masterminded it harbored ulterior motives from the beginning of the division. The evidence is clear. Based on facts and theories, the postal savings and remittance business must be returned to the Postal Administration to save the postal service from its dangerous path and prevent it from being destroyed and declining to the point of collapse. This is the first point. China has been plagued by years of internal warfare, and the people's livelihood has been depleted. The fact that the postal service has been able to struggle to survive and maintain its achievements of over thirty years without collapsing is due to the use of postal economics to maintain postal operations. However, compared to the achievements of European and American countries, it still lags far behind. Therefore, China's postal service urgently needs to be expanded, and shortened postal lines must be restored immediately. The existing bureaus should be expanded, new inland post offices should be established, and postal routes should be extended. All of these things, within the scope of what postal economics can afford, are urgent and essential plans. After China's production [unclear], any construction that is not in line with national conditions and the people's livelihood can be implemented slowly, to seek what suits the needs of our people. As is the case with our postal service, it must be expanded as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Therefore, at this time, if postal economics have surplus resources, they should be used for postal services first. Postal transportation will then be convenient, and the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit. Otherwise, if the financial resources of the postal service are used to try out national embellishments such as the so-called aviation business, the postal service will lose millions, and in reality, it will not benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. On the contrary, the postal service that the people rely on for transportation will not be actively expanded. This is what the unions are very concerned about and cannot help but consider a bad plan. In short, the aviation business may also be something that the country should undertake, but the priorities must be distinguished. In China today, are postal services or aviation more important? Which is more needed by the people? Even if the aviation business is twice as important as postal services, the government should raise large sums of money separately to establish it with all its might, so as not to hinder the foundation of other state-run enterprises and impede their future development. Otherwise, the aviation business will not be successful, and the great postal service will be implicated and even overturned. This is why the unions are sincerely concerned and cannot help but speak out, not daring to oppose the aviation business, but specifically wanting to maintain the postal service and develop its future to meet the needs of the people. Therefore, the unions believe that postal economics should be used for postal services first and should not be allocated to other purposes, so as to benefit the people's needs. This is the second point. In summary, what has been said is out of love for the postal service and to consolidate its foundation. The members of the unions serve the postal service and rely on it for their livelihood. What they have presented is based on sincerity. They respectfully hope that the conference will open, that national unity and peace will be seen again, and that all matters will be rectified. They dare to present these verbose words, appealing to the conference to quickly review and approve them, and to implement them. Not only will the future of the postal service be fortunate, but the people of the whole country will benefit from it. The presentation is urgent, and they cannot wait to receive instructions. They respectfully present this to the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Telegraphed Measures Regarding the New Chamber of Commerce Groups in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after the establishment of groups such as the Shanghai General Labor Union's Commerce and Transportation Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Government, considering them legally unfounded, submitted the detailed situation to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan's telegram arrived in Shanghai yesterday. After receiving the telegram, the Municipal Government immediately instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to announce it to the public. The original telegram stated, "Regarding the organization of illegal groups in Shanghai as reported, the situation has been submitted to the National Government for review. Awaiting the National Government's instructions before relaying them. However, before the National Government has stipulated measures, any forceful takeover, disturbance, or harm to public safety should be strictly prohibited."</p>

<h3>Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, Xu Jiqing, and Fang Jiaobo Issue a Joint Statement</h3>

<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Standing Committee Members Ye Huijun and Xu Jiqing, and Executive Committee Member Fang Jiaobo, regarding the advertisement published by Zhang Zilian, the content of which is not factual, issued a joint statement stating, "Having read Mr. Zhang Zilian's advertisement yesterday, claiming that Xiaolai and others have lost their freedom to express their true intentions, we find it deeply strange.

As for public affairs, we have been entrusted by members to hold positions in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, exercise our powers, and fulfill our duties. We cannot be bound in any way. We are open about everything and discuss matters with the public in a harmonious manner, taking responsibility for implementation. What Mr. Zhang said is not true."</p>
<h3>Wu Kaixian Telegraphed His Resignation from His Position on the Municipal Party Committee</h3>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Executive Committee Member and Standing Committee Member of this city, telegraphed the Central Government yesterday to resign, stating, "Respectfully to the Central Organization Department of Nanjing, forwarded to the Central Executive Committee: Since the secret era until now, I, Kaixian, have followed the forerunners and worked for the party, never daring to resign due to difficulties or retreat from fear. However, in the past half month, there have been many abnormal organizations, and party affairs have become increasingly entangled. There are even those who, relying on external forces under the guise of comrades, have brewed acts of fratricide, damaging the foundation of the party. This is truly painful for those who are close and pleasing to those who are enemies. Witnessing the situation, I, Kaixian, know that my strength is weak and it is difficult to turn the tide. At midnight, I examine myself and feel deeply ashamed. I am afraid that I will fail to live up to the heavy trust of the Committee. I dare to express my humble feelings and earnestly request permission to resign from the position of Executive Committee Member of the Shanghai Special Municipality. The telegram does not express the full extent of my apprehension. Respectfully, Wu Kaixian bows."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges Pan Gongzhan to Stay</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Pan Gongzhan yesterday, stating, "To Director Pan Gongzhan: Respectfully, it has been reported that you have submitted a request to the Municipal Government, expressing your intention to resign and withdraw from your position. It is admirable to be able to advance with difficulty and retreat with ease. However, Shanghai is a matter of national concern, and the Social Affairs Bureau has heavy responsibilities, especially in close relation to the industrial and commercial sectors. Since you took office, you have carefully planned and implemented various measures, and things are just beginning to take shape. We urge you to continue to serve diligently with a spirit of fortitude, to live up to the expectations of the Mayor and the hopes of the people of Shanghai. If you were to suddenly resign due to the difficulties of the times, it would be a pity to abandon the unfinished work of many years. It would not only be a disservice to public opinion but also go against your long-held aspiration to restore order. Therefore, we respectfully send this letter to express our intention to retain you. We urge you to withdraw your resignation and continue to serve as usual. We are greatly looking forward to it."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Continue to Return to China</h3>
<p>Since sending ships to Yokohama to transport a batch of overseas Chinese who were unable to return to China, there are still over 2,000 overseas Chinese in various parts of Japan who cannot return. From December 1st to yesterday, Zheng Shoujin, Lin Youxiang, Qian Jinmin, and 485 others arrived in Shanghai successively by ship from Kobe, Moji, Nagasaki, and other places.

<h3>Chinese Ships Suspend Sailings on Northern Routes</h3>
<p>Affected by Violent Japanese Military Actions</p>
<p>Both Freight and Passengers Decrease</p>
<p>Japanese Troops March into Tianjin: In recent days, various Shanghai merchant guilds have received telegrams from Tianjin stating that over 2,000 Japanese troops have marched into Tianjin from Tanggu. In the direction of Lushun, Japanese warships have also sailed to Tianjin and Dagukou, advancing by land and sea. The Chinese in Tianjin, mindful of the previous disturbances caused by Japanese troops, are increasingly panicked by the entry of violent Japanese troops into the concession.</p>
<p>Stagnation of Commercial Goods Transportation: Tianjin merchants have recently suspended cargo transportation due to the tense situation in North China. However, as it is also the end of the year, more flour is being transported. Eight to ninety thousand bags were shipped in the past two days. The transportation of other goods has plummeted. There is also a shortage of passengers traveling from Shanghai to Tianjin, resulting in losses for all outbound voyages on Northern routes.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Suspend Sailings Between Shanghai and Tianjin: The Shanghai-Tianjin route is normally served by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's regular ships, Xin Feng and Xin Ming. Recently, affected by Japanese military actions, business has declined. Northern ports have also frozen and closed due to ice. Therefore, the company decided to suspend the Northern routes and wait for the situation to stabilize before resuming operations. The company has reassigned Xin Feng to the South China route, sailing to Shantou, Xiamen, and other ports, and Xin Ming has been reassigned to the Yangtze River, carrying American wheat from Shanghai to Wuhu, Hankou, and other ports for unloading.</p>

<h3>Lawyer's Association Declaration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association's declaration states: In the past, the authorities, using the name of the Kuomintang, adhered to the Kuomintang's political program to govern the country. Over the past five years, the realization of the Kuomintang's political program in society has been less than one in a hundred. What society has endured are war disasters, banditry, poverty, corruption, and the collapse of all governance, compounded by unprecedented natural disasters and the invasion of powerful enemies. The public's attitude toward the authorities has shifted from suspicion to disappointment, and from disappointment to resentment. Now, the entire country is in turmoil and cannot continue like this. The previous Shanghai Peace Conference resolved to reform party affairs and the political system. Former Chairman Chiang has already resigned. The Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee is born of the moment. Organizational changes in the central region are imperative. However, the succeeding authorities, taking office amidst crises, will face difficulties a hundredfold greater than usual. We, as members of this association, mindful of the admonition against overstepping our bounds, and concerned about national governance, do not wish to comment excessively. However, in a leaking boat amidst wind and rain, when beams are broken and rafters collapse, even the silent golden statue cannot escape unscathed. Therefore, based on the principle of shared responsibility, and considering the deepest pains felt by the public, we summarize fourteen issues: Years of civil war, the people unable to bear it, first. Lack of civil rights, the public's opinions unable to be expressed, second. Loss of territory, the nation's sovereignty fragmented, third. Poor diplomacy, isolated and without assistance, fourth. Unreformed military system, neglected national defense, fifth. Disordered finances, unclear income and expenditure, sixth. Class struggle, lacking means of resolution, seventh. Frequent disasters, no effective relief, eighth. Furthermore, the lack of education, backward production, failed justice, corrupt officials, obstructed transportation, and unsuccessful resettlement are all detrimental to the nation and the people. Whenever the people think of these things, some gnash their teeth in anger, while others hang their heads in despair, and they uniformly attribute these to the shortcomings of the authorities. If the succeeding authorities cannot establish a plan in advance, clearly demonstrate it to the people, abandon deception, and establish great trust, then the future of the country will not be easy to predict. We summarize these fourteen points and ask the succeeding authorities to declare their policy. Some may suspect this is just the same old story, unrelated to the grand scheme. We dare to elaborate on its relevance for discussion with people across the country, which will surely be of benefit. The prominent forces within the country can be grouped into four: Nanjing, Guangdong, Shanxi, and Fengtian (Liaoning). Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, and the latent Red Party are not included. The previous authorities, shouting the slogan of unification, spared no effort to overcome all difficulties to achieve it. The result was the same failure as previous warlords. The opposition forces remain divided, and their infighting and plotting increase daily. The continuous civil war has depleted the nation's strength and destroyed talent, leaving the public unable to live in peace, and stifling all vitality. When faced with the invasion of a powerful neighbor, each force looks at each other in astonishment, daring not to act. All living beings feel extreme heartache. How should we select and implement reforms, and choose stable strategies to balance the various forces, bring all interests into alignment, so as to permanently end civil war and stabilize the people's livelihood? This is what those who plan for the country should consider first. The national title is Republic, the party title is Kuomintang, but the public is not allowed to interfere in any government affairs. Since the authorities' words and actions contradict each other, the people are naturally alienated. The saying "the people can carry the boat, but they can also capsize it" should be deeply considered. Moreover, the national crisis is urgent, and future troubles are looming. A single tree is hard to support, but many hands make light work. How should we implement constitutionalism and promote democracy, so that the entire nation can work together to bear the burden of difficulties? This is what those who plan for the country should consider first. The eastern provinces, with vast fertile lands and inexhaustible resources, are the source of sustenance for the entire nation, and the lifeblood of future generations. Domestic public opinion for war is willing to sacrifice lives for it, not just to maintain face and protect national rights. Moreover, if the balance of power is not maintained, the disaster of dismemberment will inevitably occur. If we do not drive out the invading bandits, then the country, however large, will not be enough to satisfy the greedy appetite of the imperialists. How should we recover lost territories and complete the national territory? This is the first step in stabilizing the people's hearts and supporting the nation's destiny. In the past, the authorities, on one hand, sought to eliminate the communists and sever relations with Russia, and on the other hand, supported party affairs and advocated revolutionary diplomacy. Furthermore, because of their focus on civil war, they neglected foreign affairs, resulting in a large number of vacant international diplomatic posts, leading to isolation in the international community. If not for the constraints of international treaties such as the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the cold and cruel face of the international community would be unbearable for us to face. How should we determine our diplomatic policy to enhance our international standing? This is also a crucial way to secure domestic peace, resist foreign aggression, and consolidate the foundation of the nation. Recruiting soldiers can easily lead to warlordism. In recent years, the concepts of "cherishing strength" and "maintaining territory" have filled the minds of soldiers, fostering a bad habit of being brave in internal conflicts and cowardly in resisting foreign invasion. The nation's annual revenue is mostly used to support the military, yet when invaders and bandits suddenly arrive, it is as if they are entering an uninhabited land. All the nation's sea and air fortresses are insufficient to defend themselves, and weapons and ammunition are even more insufficient to supply themselves. Alas, the people have nowhere to die! How should we strengthen national defense and reform the military system? This is an urgent task for establishing the nation. Finance is the lifeblood of the nation. Every bit of it comes from the people. In the past, the authorities took every penny and used it like dirt. It is said that to facilitate civil war, many telegraph operators were paid monthly salaries of over ten thousand yuan. The cost of buying a confidential telegram was tens of thousands without compunction. Some large armies were purchasing equipment at exorbitant prices. There was no limit. In recent years, the excessive issuance of public bonds and the improper collection of revenue have all been driven by inflated expenditures and abuse. Public grievances are boiling, and national credibility has been swept away. Can this be allowed to continue? How should we thoroughly reorganize and conduct public audits, showing the people how funds are used, and demonstrating great trust to both domestic and foreign entities? This is the foundation for maintaining the people's hearts. Class struggle is the result of unequal living conditions and a prelude to social collapse. At the end of the nineteenth century, German economists and politicians were uniquely insightful enough to see this trend and created systems such as labor insurance and employment services to appease workers (which have now become extensive international legislation). This was able to stabilize society, even after experiencing the Great War and great revolution and enduring all the painful hardships humans can suffer, without shaking the social structure. Recently, mechanical progress has been rapid, eliminating the need for human muscle labor. However, the German authorities, still based on their traditional political beliefs, restricted factories from using new machinery to prevent unemployment. This historical fact is a powerful guide for stabilizing society. Our authorities verbally promote agricultural and industrial policies, but the suffering of farmers and workers has only increased. International best practices such as labor insurance have never been mentioned, while on the other hand, they engage in high-pressure suppression and talk of eliminating communists, which is like climbing a tree to catch a fish or heading south by driving the chariot north. How should we protect the interests of workers to quell class struggle and stabilize the lives of the people? This is an essential component for pacifying the nation. Our country is based on agriculture, with over 85% of the population being farmers. However, political orders are not well-executed, internal strife does not cease, and international economic aggression increases daily. Even in years of good harvests, it is difficult to achieve self-sufficiency for every family. In the event of floods or droughts, the government has no grain reserves, and individuals have no food for the next day. Although charitable organizations can provide some relief, it is often like using a cart of water to put out a cart of burning firewood, unable to alleviate hunger and cold. The young and strong scatter in all directions, while the old and weak are left in ditches. According to historical accounts, powerful individuals have often hijacked disaster victims, leading to widespread turmoil and the overthrow of political power. This year, there are tens of millions of disaster victims in fourteen provinces. The bitter cold is only halfway through, and many spring crops have not yet been planted. The dangerous future is just beginning. How should we comfort the afflicted and save the dying? How should we prevent disasters and prepare for the future? These are the foundations for stabilizing society. Education is essential for developing the natural talents of the people. Modern nations implement compulsory education to strive for universal access. This has not been seen in our country. Illiteracy is rampant, and out-of-school children are all over the country, especially in regions afflicted by war and disaster. The educational methods adopted in the past were mostly insincere, incomplete, and impractical, running counter to the idea of universal compulsory education. If this continues, not only will the nation's natural talents never develop, but national consciousness will become increasingly numb, class divisions will deepen, and the spirit of struggle will become more acute. This is a major hidden worry for the future. How should we determine an educational plan to place the entire nation on the same level and progress alongside other nations in the world? This is essential for supporting the survival of the nation and cultivating the foundation of the country. Developing production is essential for improving the people's livelihoods. Our country's material resources are extremely abundant, but land lies barren and goods are abandoned, leaving the general public in hunger and cold, unable to make a living. The reason for this is simply the lack of skills and the inability to develop resources, and the lack of laws to guarantee the credibility of production. As a result, those who handle affairs are always at a loss, and those with capital hesitate to invest. How should we recruit talent and attract capital to develop production and improve livelihoods? This is the most important task for those who lead the country. The judicial organs represent the nation in maintaining the law. Life and freedom depend on their protection, and rights and obligations are balanced through them. Since our country's reforms, we have inherited the European legal system by blindly copying it, resulting in a system that is ill-fitting. Moreover, due to constant changes, there are many gaps and flaws. Since the national government established its capital in Nanjing, the judicial organization has not made any progress. Instead, special trials and administrative penalties have fragmented the authority of the courts and disrupted the judicial system. On the one hand, court funding has been decreasing, and judicial talent has been scattered and withered. As a result, the people view law officials as venomous snakes and the courts as ghost dens. The law has lost its credibility, and the people have no standards to follow. How should we thoroughly reorganize this so that legal professionals can fulfill their duties, and the people can have norms to follow? This is an urgent task. When the national government was first established, the officials employed were not always based on qualifications and grades. As political tides rose and fell, subordinate officials often followed senior officials. Those who sought official positions would not hesitate to curry favor with influential figures and bribe their way into power. Those who gained positions often felt like they were only in office for a short time, seeking only immediate gains and neglecting long-term planning. The corruption of the officialdom has infected the entire country. The alienation of the people is mainly due to this. How should we rectify the official system and clarify the governance of officials? This is also an essential way to maintain the people's hearts. The transportation system of a nation is like the circulatory system of a person. Obstruction of transportation is like paralysis, causing the loss of basic functions. Our country's transportation is hindered, preventing progress in military, political, cultural, and commercial fields. Even the wisest will sigh in despair. How should we strive to improve this? This is the basis for initiating all administrative affairs. Although our country has a large population, the border areas have vast and uninhabited lands. Since the abolition of military settlements at the end of the Qing Dynasty, resettlement has long been discontinued. Like ivory that invites its own destruction, hoarding only invites theft. Since we abandon vast fields, it is inevitable that powerful neighbors will covet them. How should we facilitate resettlement and strengthen the border areas? This is also of great concern to the national economy and the people's livelihood. All these fourteen issues are what the people urgently demand but have not been able to get answers to from the previous authorities. Since the succeeding leaders are not satisfied with the current situation, they should consider these major issues thoroughly. It is hoped that they will issue a great call, shaking and awakening the masses, so that the people can all benefit. Furthermore, those who observe the country are often shocked by the politics of the newly established Soviet Russia. The key to their success, unmatched by other nations, lies in two things: (1) Before the promulgation of any policy, it must be carefully considered by a design agency that brings together numerous experts, ensuring that it is appropriate before being implemented; (2) A large-scale supervisory agency is established, granting it broad powers. From the government to the people, all organizations are under its watchful eyes and strict supervision. Anyone who does not act according to the planned plans or national laws is immediately subject to severe and effective measures. This ensures that there is no backlog of paperwork and that orders are carried out. Our country's officials are accustomed to following old practices. Policies and reality often do not align. Shang Yang said, "All countries have laws, but they lack a method to ensure that laws are enforced." We hope that in the future, when the authorities are designing and planning, they will gather input from various sources, and not simply rely on high-ranking officials to draft policies based on their own opinions. After the promulgation, they must also conduct thorough supervision to ensure that it is implemented, and not just rely on empty words, repeating the mistake of attempting everything and accomplishing nothing. Gentlemen of the country, do not take these words lightly.</p>

<h3>Footprints on Lime Powder</h3>
<p>A Theft Case of Over 6,000 Yuan Solved</p>
<p>Servant Steals Due to Lack of Funds for Wedding</p>
<p>Hu Shouyao, a resident of No. 282 Aiwenyi Road, runs a yarn business and is considered a well-to-do family. Recently, due to his mother's death, he needed a large sum of money, so he kept 7,000 yuan in banknotes and silver coins in the drawer of his accounting room's desk. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night on the 25th of this month, a thief broke into the room and stole the money. The next morning, upon discovery, it was found that 6,548 yuan and three jiao had been stolen. The glass window of the accounting room was also broken. The case was reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They found that a bucket of lime powder in the room appeared to have been kicked over by the thief. As a result, there was lime powder scattered on the floor, and the thief, inadvertently, stepped in the powder, leaving behind shoe prints. However, after thoroughly inspecting the traces, they did not extend outside the house, so it was determined that the theft was committed by someone inside the house. Therefore, all male and female servants in the Hu family were questioned one by one. Soon, it was discovered that the soles of the shoes of a servant named Xu Jinhong also had lime powder on them. His shoes were taken and compared with the shoe prints on the floor, and they matched perfectly. Thus, the case was solved. Upon further investigation, Xu, realizing that it was difficult to deny the accusations, confessed everything. He said that he was planning to get married but lacked the financial means. Last night, he saw that the master had placed a large amount of money in the drawer, and the key was on the table. He was blinded by greed and broke into the room to steal the money. The stolen silver coins were hidden in the stove in the kitchen, and the banknotes were placed in the pillowcase, without having spent a single cent. The detectives searched as he said and found the original stolen goods, without any missing. Xu was taken to the police station and detained. Xu is only 21 years old and has worked for the Hu family for eight years without any previous misconduct. His parents and grandmother are still in his hometown. After he was arrested, his father heard the news and came to Shanghai to appeal. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Xu to the First Special District Local Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Wu Tingqi. Xu still pleaded guilty and said that he had acted out of a momentary mistake. He begged for forgiveness and promised never to do it again. His master, Hu Shouyao, was also very generous and sent his bookkeeper, Zheng Zhongren, to the court to represent him, requesting that the judge consider the defendant's first-time offense and give him a lenient sentence. Judge Wu sentenced the defendant, Xu Jinhong, to six months of imprisonment for the crime of theft, suspended for three years. During the probation period, his family members were responsible for supervising his conduct. The stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Reactions to the Ferry Fare Increase</h3>
<p>The Pudong Fellow-Provincials Association received a letter from members Xu Zuoxun and others regarding the increase in ferry fares in Pudong, requesting that they submit it to the Municipal Government to rescind the order. The letter stated: Respectfully, on the 18th of this month, Zuoxun and others saw a report stating that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, considering that the ticket prices of various ferry terminals and the distance of the routes did not match the current traffic conditions, submitted a request to the Municipal Government to adjust the fares accordingly. This measure is scheduled to take effect on January 1 of next year. The second-class fare from Shanghai to Donggou, originally one jiao, will be increased by two fen, based on the actual measurement of the waterway by the Junpu Bureau, which is 34,000 feet. The second-class fare from Donggou to Gaoqiao, originally five fen, which is 16,000 feet, less than half the distance from Shanghai to Donggou, will be increased by three fen, even though it is a remote area. On the west side, before the terminals are improved, the second-class fare from Shanghai to Xidu, originally five fen, which is 25,000 feet, will be increased by two fen. The second-class fare from Xidu to Donggou, originally five fen, which is 14,000 feet, will also be increased by two fen. According to the fares set above, there is actually an increase without any decrease. Zuoxun and others further checked the business report of the Public Utilities Bureau and found that the revenue of the Municipal Ferry in the second half of the 19th year (1930) had increased compared to the previous period. The total ticket revenue for the 19th year was 108,139 yuan, 5 jiao, and 3 fen. The operating expenses were 89,687 yuan, 7 jiao, and 7 fen. After offsetting the revenue and expenses, there was a surplus of 88,451 yuan, 7 jiao, and 6 fen, so there is no need to increase the ferry fares. Moreover, the Municipal Ferry is one of the public utilities, and it is of great importance to facilitate public transportation, which cannot be compared to businesses seeking profits. During this time of national crisis, all industries are in decline, and commerce and industry are stagnant. In addition, this year's agricultural production in Pudong has been poor, and the livelihood of ordinary people is already extremely difficult. Now, the increase in ferry fares is truly unaffordable. We have always admired your association for seeking welfare for fellow villagers, so we have described the situation in detail and hope that you will review it and submit it to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Utilities Bureau for approval to rescind the order and avoid increasing ferry fares, so as to comply with the public's feelings and relieve the people's distress. This is truly a matter of public benefit.</p>
<h3>Interception of the Jiangxi Finance Bureau Chief Who Fled to Shanghai with Embezzled Funds</h3>
<p>Ordered to be Sent to the Provincial Government for Verification</p>
<p>Fu Gengtang, the Chief of the Finance Bureau of Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, collected all the funds from the bureau on the 18th of this month, claiming to be sending them to the Finance Department in the provincial capital. However, he was suddenly robbed by bandits en route, and all the cash was lost. Only a remittance slip for 4,000 yuan, which had been exchanged at Shengchang Trust and Savings Bank at No. 238 Dean Lane, North Suzhou Road, Shanghai, remained. Fu then took this remittance slip and traveled to Shanghai by a roundabout route, without first reporting to the Finance Department. The provincial government waited until the 22nd of this month and learned that Fu had arrived in Shanghai. They then telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, requesting investigation and arrest for embezzlement and escape, and to prevent the withdrawal of funds. Deputy Director Yu dispatched Xie Yuzeng, a staff member from the custody and release section, and detective Shan Bin, to the Huizhaishi Police Station, and additional Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to Shengchang Trust and Savings Bank to investigate. Fu had not yet arrived in Shanghai. It was not until noon on the 24th of this month that Fu arrived in Shanghai and went to the bank to withdraw the funds. He was immediately detained and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Wu Tingqi. Wang Yaotang, the translator of the police station, explained the situation and presented the remittance slip found on Fu Gengtang as evidence. Fu Gengtang denied embezzling and escaping, claiming that he was sending the funds to the province when he was illegally inspected by unmarked armed forces who stole the cash. That is why he came to Shanghai to exchange the remittance slip. He also claimed to have reported the situation to his superiors. Judge Wu ruled that since the Jiangxi Provincial Government had already sent a telegram requesting extradition, the defendant could file a complaint with the provincial government regarding whether he had embezzled and escaped, which was not for this court to investigate. Therefore, Fu Gengtang, along with the remittance slip, was handed over to the officers from the Municipal Police Bureau and escorted back to Jiangxi Province for investigation.</p>
<h3>Henan County Magistrate Allowed to be Extradited</h3>
<p>Jin Yuzhen, the former Magistrate of Xinzheng County, Henan Province, left his post in June of this year without waiting for the handover and entrusted You Lunwu, the Chief of the First Section, to handle the handover on his behalf. Later, it was discovered that there was a shortage of more than 1,300 yuan in public funds. Jin could not be found, and You was detained and given a deadline to repay the funds. However, Jin was hiding in Shanghai. You Lunwu has been detained for six months now. After You reported to the Finance Department, an arrest warrant was issued. Now, You's son, Suquan, came to Shanghai and learned that Jin was hiding at No. 13 Peipin Lane, Huanghe Road, in the French Concession. He immediately reported this to the Municipal Police Bureau, which sent a letter to the Second Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. The police were dispatched to arrest Jin and escort him to the Second Special District Court for questioning. He was ordered to wait for the Municipal Police Bureau to send personnel to extradite him back for trial. This has been reported in the previous news. Yesterday, the Municipal Police Bureau sent personnel to the Second Special District Court for extradition. Judge Luo presided over the Criminal Division and ordered the defendant to be brought to court for questioning. Jin protested loudly, saying that he should not be detained based on a single piece of paper and requested the court to guarantee his freedom. The official replied that if he had a reason, he should go to Henan to appeal. Therefore, the defendant was allowed to be taken away by the personnel from the Municipal Police Bureau and escorted back for trial.</p>

<h3>Russian Jealousy and Murder of a Dancer</h3>
<p>A Russian man named Komi Zhukov, working in a bar on Broadway, was in love with a woman named Bai Zhiwei, a dancer at a dance hall in the French Concession. Their relationship was initially very good and they were very close. However, the woman recently became romantically involved with another man, causing Komi Zhukov to become jealous. He broke into her residence at 20 Huishan Road last night and stabbed her in the throat several times with a fruit knife, severing half of her trachea. She fell to the ground and died instantly. Komi Zhukov did not try to escape after the murder. The Huishan police station was notified, arrested Komi, and will bring him to court for trial.</p>
<h3>Murder of Wife in a Moment of Anger</h3>
<p>The Murderer Sent to Court for Review</p>
<p>The woman, Zhu Da Shi, was 28 years old, from Danyang, and lived at house number 70, Sande Lane, Meibaige Road. Her husband, Zhu Genfa, 24 years old, worked as a worker in a printing house. The couple had been married for six years. Genfa had been experiencing unusual economic hardship recently, and creditors were constantly demanding payment, which made him very distressed. On the morning of the 25th of this month, the couple argued over a trivial matter. In a fit of anger, Genfa stabbed his wife, Zhu Da Shi, in the throat twice with a small knife he was carrying. Da Shi was severely injured, fainted, and bled profusely. Wang Zhihai discovered the incident and reported it to the Xinzha police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. Da Shi was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but she died soon after. Her body was taken to the forensic examination center on Philan Road. Zhu Genfa was arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, the prosecutor of the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Liu Chun, arrived at the center to examine the body. They took their official positions and interrogated Zhu Genfa, who confessed, "We usually got along very well. At the time, I was really angry and stabbed her in the throat twice with a knife." Wang Zhihai also testified. Guo君 ruled that the deceased, Zhu Da Shi, had indeed died from knife wounds to the throat. The perpetrator, Zhu Genfa, was prosecuted by the police station and should be sent to court for review. A small knife was temporarily stored in the police station, and the body was handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Woman Requests Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association to Investigate the Whereabouts of Her Husband, Yu Ailin</h3>
<p>Suspect in Liu Jinshan Case</p>
<p>Yu Ailin, a native of Ningbo, is 34 years old and works as an assistant foreman in the coppersmith section of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company (Hed Road section). On the 15th of this month, he was implicated in the case of his friend, Liu Jinshan, and was arrested by the Jing'an Temple police station and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Those arrested at the same time included Liu Jinshan's elder brother, Liu Kuiyuan, and his wife, Tang Xuelan. At that time, Wang Bin, an inspector from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, came to the court to request the transfer of the prisoners, which was approved. Yu Ailin's wife, Yu Tu Shi, believed that her husband was innocent and requested the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai to send a letter to clear his name. Later, the military law office of the Garrison Headquarters replied that the case of Yu Ailin et al. was still at the Special District Court and had not yet been transferred to the headquarters. The association immediately informed Yu Wang Shi. Upon hearing this, she became very anxious. Yu Ailin et al. had been taken away by an inspector from the Garrison Headquarters on the 16th of this month, but it had been several days and they had not yet arrived at the headquarters. She was deeply concerned that there was something hidden and requested the association to find out the truth.</p>
<h3>Black and White Photography Society Photography Exhibition</h3>
<p>All Proceeds Donated to Flood Relief</p>
<p>The Black and White Photography Society is organized by loyal members of the photography community. Although it has only been established for two years, it has been diligently working on in-depth study and has not rushed to hold public exhibitions. Recently, the society felt that the Chinese people were busy running around to deal with the national crisis and had no time to care for the compatriots in the flood-stricken areas who were suffering from cold and hunger this summer. It gathered photographic works from all its members, selected hundreds of excellent pieces, and borrowed the photography room of the Shishi News Agency in the Xiaohuayuan on Sanma Road for a public exhibition for three days, starting on New Year's Day of the 21st year. All works were priced for sale to donate to the flood-stricken areas. Although the amount is small, it shows the society's intention to save the nation through art, which can be an awakening for the art community. It is expected that art photography enthusiasts will compete to visit and happily purchase the products to support the effort.</p>

<h3>Accusation Against an Unfilial Son</h3>
<p>Gambling, Smoking, and Disobeying His Elderly Mother</p>
<p>The old Mrs. Xue Zhou, a woman from Gaoyou, lives at number 15, Xitan, Laobosheng Road, in the Shanghai West district. She is 51 years old and has been widowed for many years. She has a son named Bingquan, who is 28 years old. He was raised by her since childhood. She worked to make a living. After Bingquan grew up, she arranged for him to learn carpentry and, in 1926, arranged for him to marry a Sun woman from his hometown. Mrs. Xue thought that her son had a job and a family and that she could rely on him in her old age. Unexpectedly, Bingquan changed his ways soon after marrying. He abandoned his profession, became a vagrant, and often quarreled with his wife. As a result, Sun became resentful and developed an illness, eventually dying in the autumn of last year. From then on, Bingquan became even more absurd, gambling and smoking all day long. He accumulated debts and pawned everything. When his mother questioned him, he dared to speak harshly and was extremely unfilial. Recently, unable to borrow money, he demanded money from his elderly mother to support his smoking habit. If she refused, he would scold her. His mother could no longer bear it. Yesterday morning, while her son was lying on the bed at home, she snatched his opium pipe and lamp and, along with her son, reported the crime to the police station in the sixth district. After separate questioning by the district chief, who determined that the case involved idleness and disobedience to his elderly mother, a crime that could not be excused, he immediately prepared a document and sent him to the local court for trial.</p>
<h3>Confiscation of Smuggled Opium</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Xinming" ship was returning to Shanghai from Tianjin. When the ship reached Tanggu, customs officers found a batch of smuggled opium hidden in the engine room. Customs officials confiscated the contraband and investigated the smuggler. The shipowner's investigation revealed that the opium was stolen and loaded by Lin Rui Da. Lin was not on the ship but was a helmsman on the Jiangjing ship. The Tianjin Customs fined the Xinming ship 1,000 taels of silver on the spot, and the ship was released. The shipowner was ordered to detain the opium offender and transfer him to court for prosecution. The shipping company has followed these instructions.</p>

<h3>Japanese Man Shoots Doorkeeper</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 PM last night, an unexpected visitor, a Japanese man, arrived at the Sanyutou Foreign Company, a Japanese company at number 8, Nanxun Road, Hongkou. The doorkeeper, Shen Quanfu, (46 years old) asked him what he wanted. The man replied that he was there to meet the owner. Shen led him inside and asked him to wait downstairs while he informed the owner. Unexpectedly, the Japanese man insisted on going upstairs. When Shen refused, the man took out a handgun and fired a shot, hitting Shen in the lower abdomen. The bullet went through, and blood gushed out. The assailant then fled. People called Hua detectives 437 and 418, who hired a car to send Shen to Tongren Hospital for treatment. They also reported the incident to the Hongkou police station and requested an arrest.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Approves Bonuses for Staff on Two Railways</h3>
<p>Result of Guo Chengen's Request to Beijing</p>
<p>According to the Ri Ri News Agency, staff on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways who have served for more than six months will be given bonuses by the management bureau at the end of each year as an incentive. This year, due to the financial situation of the two railway bureaus, the revenue and expenditure offset each other, leaving no surplus, making it impossible to allocate the bonuses. Staff on the two railways had repeatedly requested the bureau to issue the bonuses, but the issue was not resolved. Guo Chengen, director of the two railway bureaus, personally went to Beijing to present his views to the Ministry of Railways and request approval for the allocation. His request was approved by the Ministry of Railways, which agreed to allocate the funds. Guo returned to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and ordered the funds to be raised.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhou Cailiang's Message (The Responsibilities of Shop Assistants in Boycotting Japanese Goods)</h3>
<p>Recently, the call for economic severance with Japan has spread throughout the country. If this matter can be sustained, it will be enough to deal a fatal blow to the Japanese invaders. However, the repeated failures of the past are truly heartbreaking. Therefore, how to plan for the future requires careful and thorough consideration. As a member of the business community, I would like to share my experience in service regarding the various responsibilities that should be fulfilled in boycotting Japanese goods, to encourage myself and inform my fellow countrymen, which is the so-called "doing what is within my power." (1) To manufacturers, we should use our daily service experience and customer feedback on domestic products to contribute to various domestic factories, so that they can improve based on the reports. We should also pay attention to substitutes for foreign goods at all times, and urge the government to carry out large-scale imitation. In this way, domestic goods will sell well, and foreign goods will be self-restricted without resistance. (2) To shop owners, the business community has made great progress in boycotting Japanese goods this time compared to the past, such as voluntarily sealing up and reporting, which is admirable. However, I have heard that there are still a few merchants who are blinded by greed and ignore the greater good, and even stoop to selling Japanese goods, or disguise them and vigorously promote them. Customers find it difficult to distinguish them, so it is easy to confuse them. Shop assistants, on the other hand, have more extensive access to information, and should use their patriotic conscience to make sincere advice. If they are still stubborn, then follow it up with weeping and pleading. If weeping and pleading are not effective, then there is no choice but to report them. Even if they lose their jobs as a result, they will surely gain social sympathy and be assisted. (3) To customers, at this time of national crisis and intense boycott of Japanese goods, customers will surely feel ashamed to buy enemy goods. If there are those who only seek cheapness and do not know what patriotism is, then we should tell them about the recent atrocities committed by the Japanese in our Eastern Provinces, and the reasons why our country has had to implement economic severance, so that they can awaken themselves and create opportunities to promote domestic goods. If they inquire about the types of products, we should answer them in detail, as this will not only win the goodwill of customers, but also greatly benefit business. (4) To ourselves, I have heard that those who wear foreign clothes while talking about loving and using domestic goods are ridiculed by everyone. Therefore, when shop assistants are promoting domestic goods, they should also examine themselves. It does not matter if old clothes are used, but if newly added clothes still contain enemy goods, it will not only fail to convince others, but also damage their own personality. As the saying goes, "The gentleman must first examine himself before he can ask of others." I sincerely hope that my fellow shop assistants will reflect on these words.</p>
<p>(Reply) If everything Mr. Zhou said is done, he can be considered a model shop assistant. Originally, this matter of boycotting Japanese goods mainly depends on the shop assistants. If it succeeds in the future, and when it comes to whose contribution is the greatest, someone will surely think that it is the contribution of the general shop assistants that is the greatest. Shop assistants, work hard, work hard.</p>

<h3>Memories of Dailiang</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Since the standard of living in the world has increased, it is not only the Chinese who suffer, but also various countries in the East and West. Recently, I saw a foreign newspaper report on the plight of economic panic in Japan. The number of unemployed workers is increasing. The number of unemployed university graduates has reached 15,000. Even for female students, there are those who change to learning singing and playing instruments without graduating from specialized courses, wanting to become geishas. Thinking of this, I recall Shanghai thirty years ago. The area around Zhonghongqiao and Yalu Road was a gathering place for Japanese prostitutes. I occasionally drank with friends around the stove at the Apricot Blossom Pavilion. A guest once asked the manager about the procedure for calling a Japanese prostitute. The manager immediately presented a "Hundred Beauties Picture" for the guest to choose from. Generally, those who were ugly would sing well, and those who were beautiful would sing poorly. Each hour cost five "eagle wings" (silver coins). The prostitutes who sang well held a cow horn piece in their hands, plucked the strings, and sang loudly, but it was not very pleasant to listen to. However, the Japanese prostitutes were very strict in serving guests. Whoever called them would sit beside that person, and would not interact with the person sitting next to them. After a full hour, they would smile, bow, say goodbye, and leave, with absolutely no affectionate or coquettish attitude. It is said that the night fee was only doubled. Later, it was banned by the Japanese consulate, and since the Republic of China, we have not seen such people again.</p>
<h3>The Story of a Confucian Official Fighting Against the Japanese</h3>
<p>— Qiu Wenwei</p>
<p>I once read in the notes of a Ming dynasty person about the events of Ren Gong's resistance to the Japanese, and I was always moved and admired, and could not help myself. Ren Gong served as a county magistrate and deputy magistrate through the imperial examination, but he had never been in the military. However, in a moment of crisis, he generously accepted the order, expecting to die. He did not even want to say goodbye to his family. In the end, he was able to drive newly recruited soldiers, annihilate fierce bandits, defend the border and strengthen the garrison, and achieve considerable success. Seeing that he faced arrows and blades, and his body was covered with wounds, yet a Confucian official was able to do this, can he not be called a great man? Alas, the Northeast has fallen, and the people are suffering. The severity of the disaster is greater than that of the late Ming dynasty. However, those who hold high positions and possess heavy troops are losing power and land, harming the country and endangering the people, allowing foreign tribes to invade, and unable to add a single soldier or arrow. They are still cautious and hesitant, looking forward and backward, and must weigh the strength and weakness and predict the success or failure before going to war. Then, there will be no opportunity to fight forever. Therefore, I have extracted the old events of Ren Gong and narrated their outline, so that those who bear the responsibility of guarding the land may know what to learn from.</p>
<p>Ren Gong Huan, courtesy name Yingqian, was a native of Changzhi, Shanxi. He was a Jinshi in the 23rd year of Shizong. Nine years later, he became the County Magistrate of Di Su. In the intercalary March of the following year, Renzi, the Japanese alarm was first heard. At that time, there had been peace for a long time, and the soldiers suddenly rose up, shocking far and near. In April, the bandits attacked Taicang. Cai Zhongcheng ordered Gong to suppress them, giving him 300 soldiers, all newly recruited. Gong expected to die, without turning back. He did not enter to say goodbye to his family, but wrote a letter to them and left. He personally put on armor and went to battle. He encouraged the soldiers, and none dared to disobey. Gong followed the bandits' direction and set up defenses. He wore tattered clothes and straw sandals, and walked with the soldiers. When it rained, it was dark and there was no rest. He relied on grass, chewed dry provisions, and drank water, sharing the same hardships. He also exhorted them with ancient righteous deeds, so the soldiers submitted to his heart, and were willing to live and die with Gong. On the fifth day of the following year, Gui Chou, the bandits approached the city of Jiading. Gong and the Zhejiang Deputy General Lu Tang attacked together, agreeing to use fire as a signal. They advanced on all sides. The soldiers fought desperately, setting fire to kill them. The bandits charged away like pigs. Soon, the bandits spread throughout the inland. Gong traveled to Taicang, where all the bandits in the villages had gathered, encircling the city, and preparing siege equipment on three sides, intending to slaughter them. They approached with melee combat and climbed the city walls. Gong led the death squad to chop them with flying blades. Arrows and stones rained down, killing and wounding many. The bandits initially thought that we were easy to deal with and that the city could be taken in the morning and evening. At this point, they began to fear. In the first month of Jia Yin, the bandits captured Chongde and attacked Wujiang. The Inspector Zhou Gong Rudou ordered Gong to supervise Yu Dayou and other armies to attack Shengdun in a pincer movement, killing three thousand. They attacked Miaohu, killing seventy-three. The bandits' momentum was greatly weakened. In May, they returned to Lujing. Gong fought fiercely with them on the dam. From Chen to Shen, the bandits were routed, beheading eight hundred, almost wiping them out. But Gong hurriedly returned home barefoot because of the taboo of mourning. He was devastated by his grief, and because he had previously fought without regard for his own safety, he faced arrows and blades, and his body was covered with wounds, he fell seriously ill. He died not long after.</p>
<h3>Trivial Talks</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>Raising a Cat is Not as Good as Feeding Mice A certain Jia neighbor raised a cat. At first, he loved it very much. However, the cat was full, ate well, slept soundly, and let the mice run rampant. It also often left excrement on the couch or stole food from the kitchen. Even the goldfish raised in the courtyard were often consumed by it. Jia was furious and said, "I provide fish and meat every day to feed the cat, hoping that it can eliminate the mice. Now, not only does it not catch mice, but it is even more troublesome than the mice. What use do I have for such a cat?" So he drove it away and did not raise cats anymore. Instead, he placed a small amount of rice in the dark corners every day to feed the mice. When he looked at it in the morning, there were no grains of rice left. The mice seemed to know his kindness, and since then, they have not been harmful to people. Jia once told people about this, saying, "I treated the cat well, but the cat did not know how to do its duty. I feed the mice, and the cost is minimal, and it can turn out to be harmless to people. Therefore, 'Raising a cat is not as good as feeding mice.'" Those who heard this passed it around as a joke.</p>
<p>A White Turtle The Shanghai dialect uses "white turtle" to mean "goose." It is not true that turtles are white. Unexpectedly, I have seen a white turtle. I remember in August this year, one evening, I took a leisurely walk across the Nine-Turn Bridge in the Town God Temple Yu Garden. I leaned on the railing and looked down at the swimming fish. Someone next to me said in surprise, "A white turtle." I looked closely and saw a giant turtle floating on the surface of the water. Its whole body was white, and its head, tail, feet, and claws were all white. Later, I passed by the place, but I never saw it again. It is not surprising to see a white sparrow, but I don't know if this white turtle is also a rare object. I specifically record it to ask experts. Also, a certain amusement park in this city once had a white turtle on display for people to see. I don't know what its shape is like or where it came from. I should explore it when I have time.</p>
<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>The Reason for Female Longevity There is an old lady in Scotland who is one hundred years old. She is still very healthy. Someone asked her the reason for her longevity. She said, "The reason why women live long is because they are more gentle by nature and are always calm."</p>
<p>The Healthiest Place in the World No matter how hygienic any country in the world is, it cannot reach the healthiest state. The healthiest place on the entire planet is the Antarctic region. Any kind of microorganism and germ cannot live there.</p>
<p>High Stools in Photography Studios In several film company photography studios in Hollywood, America, there are several very high stools specially for female stars to sit on. This is because they often wear long skirts when performing. Sitting on high stools can prevent the skirts from touching the ground and getting dirty.</p>
<p>A Clever Way to Stop Smuggling On the border between the Netherlands and Germany, people often smuggle car oil and rubber tires in cars. As they pass by at a glance, the German authorities have specially made a kind of wooden board. The board is full of iron clusters. Throwing it on the road will prevent vehicles from passing.</p>
<h3>Going to War</h3>
<p>— A Member of the Youth Aid Horse Regiment</p>
<p>(Nine) Leaving Zhenjiang</p>
<p>We stayed in Zhenjiang for two whole days. Everyone's spirit was rejuvenated by this long period of rest and was as vigorous as usual. So we moved forward again.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 18th, we said goodbye to the students in Zhenjiang and left Zhenjiang by car. All the way, we only heard the rumbling of the rails, which was very similar to the sound of guns and cannons heard when sitting in an armored car on the front line. The vast fields outside the window were spinning by non-stop. Isn't everything in the universe progressing endlessly like this? However, I feel that the current state of our country is in danger of stopping its progress. Perhaps this is the reason why the Japanese invaders are encroaching on us.</p>
<p>At about five o'clock, we were about to reach Nanjing Station. As we passed the foreign flag, the car suddenly stopped. Then, a locomotive came and towed the car we were sitting in away from the train and onto another track. After a short time, it pulled up next to a platform. Not only were there no people welcoming us at the station, but there was not a single passenger to be seen. The residents next to the station were only a few low houses covered with straw. On the left side of the car, there were three or five iron-covered freight cars. The scene was very desolate. At this time, it was dusk, and combined with the short days of this winter season, it was already difficult to see anything clearly. I only saw many masts not far from the car window. These things made me suspicious. Could it be that the government is cracking down on us? I thought. My mind was guessing wildly. Just then, the leader of the group arrived. I could no longer bear it and finally asked the leader of the group. I learned that the Nanjing Garrison Command had sent the students from various places in Beijing back to their schools. It was feared that the students would use the excuse of welcoming us and refuse to go back. Therefore, the authorities did not let outsiders know about our arrival in Beijing. In order to avoid attention, they simply moved our vehicles to this riverside station. Therefore, we understood the government's difficulties and spent the night in the car that night.</p>
<p>We slept in the car, which was the first time since we set off. Although we didn't sleep as comfortably as we did when we were at Zhenjiang Middle School, we were in a carriage filled with the smell of representatives from various provinces, especially with brothers who were determined to go to the national crisis together. Our eyes were drawn to the people from the various provinces and cities. Our hearts were competing with each other for the courage to kill the enemy in the future. As a result, the elements of our friendship increased, and the spirit of destroying the Japanese became stronger.</p>
<p>On the 19th, we were still in the car. I don't know how the students of Jinling University had learned about our news. They sent representatives to contact us about welcome matters. We can probably stay in the Jinling University school building tomorrow night.</p>
<h3>Remarks on the National Crisis Relief Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>The national crisis is urgent! The violent Japanese army has occupied our Eastern Provinces and has launched an attack on Jinzhou. If Jinzhou is lost, then Pingjin will be in danger. If Pingjin is in danger, then our southeastern provinces will be directly threatened. Therefore, if we want to seek relief at this time, there are still some days left. After this, I am afraid that there will be no more opportunities for us to calmly plan. Although our painters and calligraphers each pride themselves on individualism, when it comes to the loss of the country and the destruction of the nation, their suffering is no different from that of others. Ms. He Xiangning has just returned from Western Europe and initiated a National Crisis Relief Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition. Painters and calligraphers on the sea were all invited to participate. For a time, the response was like a myriad of streams flowing into the sea. Ms. He's admiration reaches this point. Or is it that people who are united in overcoming the national crisis have the same heart? With my incompetence, I will also attach myself to the tail of a good horse. In the face of great difficulties, everyone is responsible. Who can bear not to do it? This is indeed my ambition, and I have expressed it again and again. It's just that because of the delay, it has not been realized. The conference recommended Mr. Wang Yingbin and me to be in charge of publicity. Although I am incompetent, I have no choice but to try my best in the face of the great cause. The results of the ticket sales were exceptionally satisfactory. The efforts of Mr. Zheng Hongnian and Mr. Ye Gongchuo were instrumental in achieving this. The collection of works was carried out by Mr. Liu Haisu and Mr. Qian Shoutie, and the results exceeded the expected amount. However, without Ms. He Xiangning, Mr. Zhu Shaoping, and Mr. Liu Yazi's calm arrangements, it would not have been easy to achieve such results. As for the layout of the venue, Mr. Sun Xueni and Mr. Xue Baolun were responsible for it. They are experienced and capable. The opening should give us an impression of orderliness. The works added this time are all carefully crafted masterpieces by famous artists. I also have some humble works added. How could I not know to avoid the suspicion of showing off? Gold leaping out of the furnace is considered strange. I certainly don't want that either. However, publicity is involved, so I cannot stop eating because of choking. Perhaps it will also be understood by connoisseurs. In the future, if we fight bravely and rescue someone, so that the mountains and rivers are returned to us and the golden goblet is not missing, the people of the country will have contributed to it. Will its achievements be solely attributed to us painters and calligraphers?</p>
<h3>Talks on Pink and Black</h3>
<p>— Peilan</p>
<p>The entire play "Yutang Chun" comes from Shaanxi Bangzi. The Erhuang Qingyi initially did not practice this. When I was young, I listened to the singing of the opera troupe. "Yutang Chun" was rarely seen. Occasionally, it was performed by Bangzi Qingyi. At that time, only Tian'e Dan, Sizhan Deng, Boli Cui, and Xiao Jinwa were considered excellent. The audience did not pay much attention to this play, and it was not as popular as "Burning Bones," "Willow Forest Pond," "Three Suspicion Plan," or "Biographies of Martyrs." The famous Erhuang Qingyi predecessors, such as Xi Luyi, Yun Shitou, Chang Zihe, and others, were never seen singing "Yutang Chun." Feng Zihe was known for being both a Zheng Gong Qingyi and a Huadan and enjoyed a great reputation at one time, but he never became famous for "Yutang Chun." During the era when the New Stage moved to the Sixteenth Pier, Zihe and Mao Yunke both belonged there. Occasionally, they performed the entire play "Yutang Chun" during the day. Zihe only sang the section "Hongtong is Falsely Accused." The "Escort" and "Joint Trial" were all taken up by Yunke. Yunke was originally a Bangzi singer. Later, someone changed the "Escort" and "Joint Trial" sections into Erhuang. As a result, almost all Qingyi and Huashan singers in the north and south sang these two plays. When Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu emerged, "Yutang Chun" became even more popular. Yanqiu, through the transmission of Yao Qing, sang a new tune. Those who imitated it intensified their efforts. Although the old rules were gradually lost, the music lovers never tired of listening to it. However, the scenes before the escort, such as the three brothels, temple fairs, giving silver, and Hongtong being falsely accused, are still the old rules of Bangzi. When Xun Huisheng and Xu Biyun succeeded, the entire play "Yutang Chun" was sung by one person from beginning to end. As a result, the entire play was changed to Erhuang, and the Bangzi face disappeared completely. Xu Biyun can be ignored, but Xun Huisheng's "Yutang Chun" was also very exciting in the first half. I especially love the Nanbangzi in the "Making Up" scene. The lyrics are elegant and refined, and the tune is clever and beautiful. The graceful and charming singing moves the heart. Beikai Company has included this section in a record. Those who love to watch "Yutang Chun" can try to listen to it.</p>
<h3>Casual Talks from the Tixiang Zhai</h3>
<p>— Cheng Dequan</p>
<p>In the upheaval of the Xinhai Revolution, those in the know already knew that the Qing Dynasty was doomed to perish. Most of the governors and governors abandoned their cities and fled. Only three people, the Governor of Fujian Songshou, the Governor of Shanxi Lu Zhongqi, and the Governor of Jiangxi Feng Ruzhen, sacrificed themselves to the festival. There were also three people who surrendered: the Governor of Shandong Sun Baoqi, the Governor of Guangxi Shen Bingkun, and the Governor of Jiangsu Cheng Dequan. Among these three, Baoqi changed in the middle, and Bingkun was forced. Only Dequan's rebellion was the earliest, and he was also the first to become governor. He was also appointed commander-in-chief of the allied Jiangsu and Zhejiang forces attacking Jiangning. Because of this, he was especially trusted by the great men of the founding of the country, while the old officials ridiculed him for his disloyalty. There is no right or wrong, merit or crime in the world, which has been the case since ancient times. Dequan's abandonment of the governorship to become governor, the name is different but the substance remains. The politics of democracy and the system of autocracy are completely different. There is no such thing as a traitor. Those who understand the times are outstanding. Dequan's desire not to end his political career did not ask whether the political system was democratic or monarchical, or whether the official position was governor or governor. This is clear. Dequan, courtesy name Xuelou, was a native of Rongyang, Sichuan. He was a Lin Gongsheng. He paid tribute grain to become a Second Yin and served in Anhui. Someone hated the inspecting censor Zhao Erxun for something and made a couplet to satirize him: "You are a petty scholar, born to be mean. Xun cuts off below, cutting off your descendants." Erxun was angry and did not know who had played the prank. Coincidentally, Dequan came to visit. Erxun told him. The remaining anger had not subsided. Dequan said, "I have also heard something and have changed the wording to 'You are a petty scholar, born with integrity. Xun cuts off below, cutting off no emotion.' It is truly because you are pure in nature and enforce the law like a mountain, that I thought of this. Although it is not well-written, it is still relevant." Erxun smiled and said, "It is enough to see that justice still exists in people's hearts. Your talent and learning can be seen from this." So they became friends. Later, Erxun became the General of Fengtian. Dequan had already been there first and had been promoted to the rank of prefect. Erxun repeatedly recommended his talents and was promoted from a Daoyuan to a Deputy Commander. He was acting General of Heilongjiang. When the three eastern provinces changed their ways, he asked for leave and left. He was re-appointed as the Governor of Fengtian. His political views were not in agreement with the Governor-General Xiliang. He sought other transfers, but could not get them. Suddenly, he came up with a plan. Because the Governor and Governor-General were in the same office, the Governor-General was in charge of the political power, and the Governor had nothing to do. He requested that the post be abolished. The report was approved. Liang was shocked and asked Dequan, "You wrote a memorial to the court, and the governor acted privately, secretly without letting me know. Why?" Dequan replied, "The abolition of the post, the abolition of my own post. If I ask for your approval, the Governor-General will definitely keep me. If I am kept, then the post cannot be abolished. If the post is not abolished, then my determination to retire cannot be fulfilled." Liang had no way to argue with him and dismissed it with a smile. After a little while, the decree to govern Jiangsu was issued. Liang realized how clever Dequan was in his official career. In the first year of the Republic, the provisional government was established in Nanjing. Dequan was selected to be in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. He followed the great men of the time every day and seemed to regard himself as a founding hero. When discussing a certain matter, Dequan was about to leave the meeting. The person sitting with him accused him of a great injustice. He ignored it and left. The next day, when discussing the matter again, he falsely claimed to have a sudden illness and could not speak because his throat was hoarse. In the evening, someone met him at Tang Shaoyi's seat. Dequan was talking eloquently. Zhongshan heard about it and sighed, "Such a person cannot be conspired with." At that time, there was a mutiny in Wumen. Governor Zhuang Yunkuan requested to be dismissed. Chen Qimei said that Dequan was familiar with the local situation and could be reinstated. Dequan then took up military command again. During the Gui Chou campaign against Yuan, he raised the banner of independence. When he failed, he secretly telegraphed Xiangcheng, saying that he had been forced to do so and that it was not his own intention. Xiangcheng looked at the telegram and laughed, "Xuelou will be finished from now on." From then on for more than ten years, he wore a cassock, held classics in his hand, and recited Amitabha Buddha every day. In a certain year, he died in Shanghai. His last words were to be buried in monk's clothes, probably with the intention of repentance. A certain old man said that he became a Buddha after descending to earth, which is a joke.</p>
<h3>A Letter from the Common People to the Soldiers (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Common People</p>
<p>Armed officers and soldiers, compatriots.</p>
<p>Before I speak, let me make clear my position and yours.</p>
<p>I am one of the people of the Republic of China. I am a citizen who bears national taxes and local taxes. I am the master of the country. I am a commoner who works 365 days a year without rest. You eat what we commoners eat, and wear what we commoners wear. You neither farm, nor work, nor do business. You enjoy material things much more comfortably than we commoners. Have you ever thought that you were born with a good fate to be able to survive without labor? We take the blood and sweat of generations and pay the price to support you. You receive our support. Have you ever thought about how to be worthy of us? Perhaps some of you who understand a little will say, "We are the national army. It is true that we are supported by the blood and sweat of the common people. But we are protecting the common people and defending the country. We are killing the enemy for the common people..." Since this is the case, please forgive my bluntness. I want to say a few words from the position of the common people. In peacetime, when internal wars that can lead to the destruction of the country occur, the newspapers are full of telegrams asking to fight against the rebels, waiting for orders with swords as pillows, and hating the enemy together. How admirable! The battles of Nankou and Wuchang created world-shaking achievements. How admirable is this! What about now? The violent Japanese have invaded our homes, and the voices of co-managing China are singing to the clouds again. When I open the newspaper and take a look, how many people are asking to fight against the thieves, how many are waiting for orders with swords as pillows, and how many more hate the enemy together? It almost makes us commoners suspect that this flood has washed all the brave soldiers who fought so hard in the previous civil wars to the iceberg. They are freezing and pitiful and cannot even say a word. Is the land of the three eastern provinces not Chinese? Do the people of the three eastern provinces not bear military expenses? You are the national army. Should you not care about the affairs of the three eastern provinces and not protect the people of the three eastern provinces? Are you really defending the country and killing the enemy for the common people? Thinking of the pain that the common people bear</p>
<p>and the reality of this event, tears cannot help but flow into my heart. Armed compatriots, how can you be worthy of the common people?</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Situation Calm</h3>
<p>No Strong Fluctuations　Yesterday the Gold Exchange already opened; the bullion market situation was still calm. However, sentiment among traders was initially high and then softened, so the market price rose and then fell, with a total difference of thirteen taels between countries throughout the day. Ultimately, there was a slight increase of one or two taels. The initial opening was high, likely because the silver bars saw a slight increase during this Christmas holiday. American silver showed no improvement or decline. With active buying, it quickly broke through 680 taels. Foreign exchange seemed to strengthen, but later in the session, although there was hedging, many people were looking for cash, so it kept falling, especially with the loosening of drafts, causing a sharp drop of more than ten taels. The later market trended slightly milder but had some fluctuation, with the final calculation at 676-677 taels. However, because it is the end of the lunar year, neither the bulls nor the bears had much volume to trade. Dafengheng had previously pledged to short positions, using Kangtie to advance 11.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Early Market Turned from High to Low　From the early opening, it immediately rose four taels to 679 taels. Silver bars on the 25th only rose by one-sixteenth, with no market on the 26th and 27th. American silver showed no change, so sentiment was good. Tianfenyong and others were the first to buy, rising from 78.5 taels to 83.5 taels. Soon after, Chunyuanyong and hedgers sold, and Mitsui offered March US dollars at $33.625, immediately falling five or six taels to 77.5 yuan. HSBC offered January British gold at 11 pence 6875, and Sumitomo offered March US dollars at $33.625. Then retail buyers came in, adding a little more than one or two taels. British gold quotations remained the same, ranging from nine to eight and a half taels. Suddenly, Mumbai came to buy British gold for March at half a penny, and Qian Changxiang, Fuyu, and others competed to buy, so the market situation soared, rising six or seven taels to 85 taels at 10:00 AM. Suddenly, it was heard that HSBC sold March US dollars at 625, and banks mutually traded spot British gold at 625 and spot US dollars at 75. Furthermore, Fuchang and other hedgers sold, with Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Yongtong, Taichang, Yongfeng, Yuamoyu, and others successively selling, resulting in a drop of six taels. At 10:30 AM, it was 79 taels. At that time, Mumbai bought US dollars at 625 again, and retail investors bought, adding two taels to 81 taels. By 11:00 AM, there was a renewed sign of weakness. Yu Dayuan, Maoyong, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Yongfeng, and others all sold, and March US dollars were matched at 6875, and then 75 could be settled, and British gold at 625, leading to a continuous decline in the gold price. At 11:15 AM, it was 74 taels. Japanese banks mutually traded March US dollars at 875. Afterwards, Hengyu and Taichang slightly advanced, raising it by three taels to 72 yuan. By 11:30 AM, buyers were widespread, so the price was unsustainable, and it quickly retreated by more than five taels. The noon closing was only calculated at 71.8 yuan, re-doing to 73 taels, and then reverting to more than 71 taels. The quoted price was still 725 taels, with an estimated squeeze of around 50 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Turned Milder　The afternoon market opened at 71.5 taels. Later, because Zhifengyong, Yongtong, Taichang, Cuichangyong, and others bought, and February US dollars could be sold at $34, and then Japanese merchants mutually traded spot at $4, it reached 75.8 taels at 2:30 PM. Suddenly, it depreciated by two taels, and retail investors sold. It then rose again, with Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, Hongkangyong, Zhifengyong, and others coming to pay. In particular, banks mutually traded April British gold at 5625, Datong sold January 6875 to HSBC, and Huabi offered March at 11 pence, making the market firm, reaching 78.8 taels after 3:30 PM. Later, from 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM, the trend softened because Yuanmaoyong, Hengchangyong, Taifengcheng, and goods came to sell, resulting in a drop of four taels, with slight fluctuations of one or two taels in between. It then became 74.5 taels, then adding two taels, with short positions covering. At 4:30 PM, the closing price was 76 taels, and then it was rushed to 78 taels, adding one tael compared to the 24th (according to the listed price). According to the full day, the maximum price was 85 taels, and the minimum was 71.5 taels, a difference of 13.5 taels. Goods in the early morning were 79 taels, at noon it was 1.5 taels, in the afternoon it was 1.2 yuan, and the closing was 8 taels. The quoted price was an estimated squeeze of 50 taels, recorded at 82 taels, 72 taels to replenish water at 79 taels, 83 taels in the afternoon, and the red bar was calculated to add 15 taels.</p>
<p>Sluggish Transactions at Year-End　Transactions on the table are not active. Statistics show that Qianchangxiang, Tianfenyong, Cuichangyong, and Fuyu all advanced. Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Tongtaichang, etc., came in and out intermittently. Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Yu Da all exited. In the afternoon, Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, Hongkangyong, Yifengyong, and Yuantai all advanced. Hengchangyong, Taifengcheng, and Hengyu exited. Yuanmaoyong and Dadecheng had no fixed deposits. Dalian merchants were restricted, with no more than 300 bars in and out throughout the day, and even fewer in and out for Guangdong merchants.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Hovering</h3>
<p>Hedgers Leaving at Only 25-27 Taels</p>
<p>From the 25th to yesterday, British silver only increased slightly by 0.0625, and American silver showed no prosperity or decline. Exchange rates rose and fell again, and the market situation was quite flat. Yesterday's HSBC listing, except for the French franc adding four yuan, the rest remained the same. As for the internal market, both British and American exchange rates were firm and then loosened, turning flat in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the pre-holiday closing on the 24th, British silver shrank by 0.0625, the American exchange rate leveled off, the gold market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the later market was flat, ultimately rising slightly but without special changes. There were no important news at home or abroad. Chinese merchants slightly hedged, with British silver trading about 100,000 pounds. Mumbai telegraphed to sell first and then buy, and British and Japanese banks had deposits and withdrawals. American dollars totaled about 700,000-800,000 yuan, and Mumbai also telegraphed in. As for gold merchants such as Fuchang, they hedged and sold bars, with hedgers leaving at 25-27 taels, but the settlement price was an estimated squeeze of about 50 taels.</p>

<h3>Banks Opening and Closing with Heavy Settlement</h3>
<p>The silver interest rate is high due to more money received.</p>
<p>Foreign funds are particularly busy due to government bond delivery.</p>
<p>Market Overview　Yesterday was the first day of opening for banks after the holidays. Three days' worth of settlements were processed in one day, and it was also the end of the year, so it was even busier. However, due to government bond delivery yesterday, it was slightly less than usual, but still busy. The high interest rate was due to excessive money received, with no other major key factor.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Only Yarn Fell Two Times</p>
<p>Sichuan Merchants Still Actively Buy Spot Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with the trend becoming increasingly weak and tired. Due to chaotic news about the current situation and financial emergencies, it is difficult to loosen the silver, so the overall trend cannot escape the appearance of weakness. In addition, with the Lunar New Year approaching, most retail investors tend to sell. Fortunately, Sichuan merchants continue to buy spot, so it is difficult to maintain the firmness of the market. In the last afternoon session of this month, it fell two taels, breaking into the 50 tael range, also affected by the silver situation.</p>
<p>Human Bid Situation Is Weak and Tired　The human bid market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was relatively strong due to good actual demand. Each month rose by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 yuan. This month rose by 2 yuan and 4 yuan. In the afternoon, the silver interest rate rose again, and this month fell by 3 yuan and 7 yuan, with the forward month falling by 9 yuan to 1 yuan, 1 and 2 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 27,000 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 1,500 bales, Senkang 900 bales, and Dachang 550 bales. Heshen bought 600 bales.</p>
<p>Taixing 2,800 bales, Taishengkang 700 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>February 1534 5 60,850 May 1543 3 30,500</p>
<p>Customer Sales of 2,700 Bales　Spot yarn sales are still smooth. It was found that the total number of bales bought by each merchant throughout the day was 2,700. 45 bales were among the same merchants. The market price was flat. Among the customer merchants, Sichuan advanced 1,525 bales, Luzhou advanced 70 bales, the mainland advanced 75 bales, Jiangxi advanced 110 bales, Shantou advanced 70 bales, Zhenjiang advanced 55 bales, Guangdong advanced 300 bales, Tianjin advanced 300 bales, and miscellaneous merchants advanced 70 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Rose in the Morning and Fell Back in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Result Was Little Increase</p>
<p>The cotton market needed to rise before falling, because foreign cotton was closed and the gold price was flat. However, last month, Ningbo merchants received goods, causing the market to be slightly dry. Retail investors were eager to compensate, and the market suddenly rose by four or five. However, factory demand was silent, and the factories had no intention of asking. Moreover, the cotton price stabilization committee had already reviewed it yesterday. Starting in March, the standard issue will be expanded, and all Chinese cotton can be delivered, so industry insiders mostly sold, and the market will be loose.</p>
<p>Han Bid Had a Selling Wind in the Afternoon　In the Han bid market, it was heard that the market was dry and retail investors were short. Each month rose by 3, 4, and 5 yuan. In the afternoon, those who profited settled, and some large households sold, with each month falling by 2 and 3 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 71,600 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 3,000 dan, Tianlong 1,700 dan, Taixing 2,300 dan, Dachang 1,800 dan, Yifeng 1,200 dan, and Hengde 1,300 dan. Hengyi bought 1,800 dan, Tongyu 5,000 dan, Changfeng 4,500 dan, Yongda 3,600 dan, and Changhe 2,300 dan. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>March 3240 10 185,600</p>
<p>Cotton Sales Only Packed, No Movement　Spot cotton transactions were cut off. The source was an estimated 125 bales of Yaohua.</p>
<h3>Food and River Down Rice Market Trends Upwards</h3>
<p>Shanghai South: The sources from yesterday, the 13th and 14th, the city and rural stores took advantage of this opportunity to purchase inventory. Suzhou and Tong merchants' prices rose sharply by 2-3 jiao. The early thin two crops of rice that arrived were limited, and the Ningbo stomach was still fine. The fresh goods on this street were still active, and the price also increased by 1.5 jiao. Luxiang, Xianyuan, and foreign rice increased daily, and transactions were the best, only a half-jiao increase changed to Yin yuan for spot sales, and the price did not rise or fall. The Pujiang hukou was about 3,000 dan.</p>
<p>Xinzha: The rice market is increasing daily, and people's hearts are excited, because the weather is not good and there are not many sources. In the past years, after the Winter Solstice Festival, the rice price must rise. Changxi white japonica and Kunshan Liyang rice and other goods all increased their selling prices by 2 jiao. The early and late rice sales were extremely diligent, and the situation stabilized. Yin yuan followed spot sales, and the price remained the same. Foreign pointed, Dujian, and Buzhen types were slightly responsive to customer merchants, so the price softly fell by a few points.</p>
<h3>Spot Foreign Rice Hankou Sales Active Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 3,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were packed.</p>
<p>The spot rice rose 3 jiao and the futures rice rose 1 qian.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market turned to a steady and pleasing situation. Because spot rice was easily handled by the merchants, and futures foreign firms shouted high, the spot and futures goods rose again. A total of 6,000 bags of spot Xiaojiao were opened, with Hankou merchants packing 3,000 bags, and this street and retail customers also took 3,000 bags. The price was 2-3 jiao higher than the previous market, calculated at 10 yuan, 9 yuan and 9 jiao, 9 yuan and 8-9 jiao, followed by 9 yuan and 4 jiao. 700 bags of Saigon No. 1 were priced at 11 yuan and 3 jiao to 11 yuan and 1 jiao, all taken by this street's merchants. 5-600 tons of futures return cargo were opened, with a good price of 1 qian and zero. The foreign firms that sold included Yuanli's 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon in February, priced at 5 taels 1 qian and 8 fen. Chengquan and Jinlong also sold 2,000 tons of Xiaojiao in March, priced at 4 taels and a half.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea European and American Silk Telegrams Do Not Transfer</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market was still quiet, because no one asked about spot silk in the European and American markets, and the opening price of futures silk was extremely small. New York B-grade white factory silk was only opened at 670-680 taels for near and far months. Lyon was also only 750-760 taels. The silk telegrams did not transfer yesterday, and the market atmosphere was stagnant. Only Boxing advanced five packages of yellow shaken warp, and Xinchang and others advanced fifteen packages of white dry warp, and the price was still flat and tired.</p>
<h3>American Merchants Packed a Large Batch of Factory Warp</h3>
<p>Four hundred pieces were shipped directly to New York</p>
<p>Two American merchants, Qianli and Lanlebi, are stationed in Shanghai for major silk factories in New York, or handle Chinese silk. Last Saturday, the American mail ship Xierxun exported a total of 400 pieces of yellow and white factory warp from Qianli and others, which were directly shipped from Shanghai to the port of New York.</p>
<h3>Qichun Tea Transaction Over Seven Hundred Boxes</h3>
<p>The statistics of red and green tea in Shanghai are over five thousand boxes.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, green tea from Luxiang, Tuzhuang, and other routes, British and French experts, did not have large-scale purchases, and the market was exceptionally deserted. Qimen black tea was purchased by the tea company yesterday for superior and medium grade goods, totaling 758 boxes, with selling prices from 70 taels to 100 taels, 50-60 taels lower than previously seen. At present, the inventory of black tea is estimated to be over 1,300 boxes, and green tea is over 4,000 boxes, with a total of over 5,000 boxes.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Longkou Vermicelli Arrived and Sold Vigorously</h3>
<p>The Market Price Immediately Rebounded</p>
<p>Although there have been many Longkou vermicelli arriving recently, the sales of various merchants are not weak, such as Shangjiang, Mainland, and this street merchants. The market price immediately rebounded and the customer price rebounded. The original brand vermicelli once reached 23 taels 7 qian, and there is a temporary stop in the later batches of sources. Therefore, the trend is more solid and stable. Yesterday, the market price was 23 taels and a half, an increase of 5 qian compared to before. If there is no continued source, there is still prevention of tightening again.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Fell And Turned Firm</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Transactions Are Quite Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no telegram from the sugar production area. The Shanghai Public Association market allocated dishes, and it was quite lively to release household coarse sand white from He sugar No. 24. The buyers still felt active, and the initial transaction price was 9 taels 6 qian and a half, and then it fell to 9 taels 6 qian. Over a thousand bags were traded, and the market gradually became firm and elegant. Finely ground white sand was 9 taels 7 qian, No. 20 medium sand white was 9 taels 5 qian and a half, No. 18 goods were 9 taels 5 qian 2 fen and a half, and the second grade was 9 taels 4 qian and a half, and the trend was still steady. Taikoo Sugar's market also slightly declined, because the orders were arriving and people's hearts were turning tired. The B-mark price was 11 taels 7 qian and a half to 2 fen and a half, HX-mark was 11 taels 5 qian 2 fen and a half to 5 qian, HM-mark was 10 taels and 4 qian, with two slacks in and out, and the market was nimble.</p>
<h3>Hardware 200-Pound Association Iron Is Short and the Price Is Firm</h3>
<p>The 200-pound Association iron is a hot-selling product for tobacco companies, canning factories, biscuit companies, and lard shops. Since the market was flooded with goods in the autumn, the standards have fallen back. In recent days, export merchants have frequently inquired about it, and hoarders have wanted to collect it because of the scarcity of goods and high costs, so the market air is good and the standards are likely to soar straight up. The current market price for old steel factory goods is 27 taels, and new steel factory goods are 26 taels 5 qian. As for the hard French goods, they are only 14 taels 5 qian, and the market also calls for 25 taels because of high costs, but its transactions, except for large cigarette boxes and at least biscuit cans, can not be used for cigarette cans and pig cans. According to foreign firms, imports of new and old 200-pound steel factory goods have been very deserted recently, and there is a prospect of progress in the future market.</p>
