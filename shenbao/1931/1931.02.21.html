<h3>西班牙帝制内閣成立後</h3>
<p>自來帝制與共和之戰爭。必相持至數年或數十年而始能决解。蓋帝制派旣具龐大深固之勢力。自非一時所能推倒。卽至勢窮力竭時。猶必收拾餘燼以相爭。非至陷於絶境不止。往事皆然也。然帝制之政治。不摇動則已。苟一旦摇動人心趨向共和。則其政府雖有萬鈞之能力同心一致之軍隊。終必逐漸銷融。歸於屈伏而後已。其間之勉强支撑用盡種種壓迫之力。想盡種種覊縻方法。以冀挽回頽勢。結果徒多一翻一覆之騷亂。重延民衆以無謂之苦痛而已。</p>
<p>然而帝制之當局。則决無事前見幾而退者如西班牙之共和運動。可謂潛伏已久。里夫拉内閣推倒。西班牙之人心已可見矣。而西王不悟。復以貝倫圭維持於後。至貝倫圭内閣不能維持而倒帝制已無存在餘地可知矣。而西王猶不覺悟。更組所謂帝制派集中之軍閥内閣欲以更嚴厲之手段。壓平羣衆。與共和派背城一戰。共和派縱一時爲其。所屈伏。而暫安於緘默然愈壓則反動愈力。一旦爆發。仍將至於不堪收拾而止。况乎共和派已有全國總罷工等之表示卽在目前。亦未易屈伏者乎。故西班牙之新閣雖成。而憂患正多也。</p>

<p>▲靑年勝三三（乙一）　靑年隊人才出衆、深具造詣、且動作淸爽、楚楚可觀、三三原亦勁旅、但相形之下、遠　於靑年、當靑年得二十分時、三三方開紀錄、上半時爲二十二比五、下半時起、三三發　圖報、屢有建樹、形勢略爲平和、結果靑光三十八分、三三隊十五分、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>[P談談劉三　霞菲</p>
<p>蘇曼殊寄劉三白門詩多謝劉三問消息尚留微命作詩僧。又西湖韜光菴夜聞鵑聲簡劉三句。劉三舊是多情種。浪跡烟波又一年。曼殊并爲劉三作白門秋柳圖。文姬圖。黄葉樓圖等。劉三與曼殊之交情。與劉三之風流跌宕。於此可見。劉三。原名季平。上海人。别號江南。又署江南劉三。光宣之交。留學東京成城學校陸軍騎科。工詩善書。尤精漢隷。臨撫三十餘年。得力於石門頌。曾講學於北京大學。與沈尹默合訂鬻書潤例。一時名馳南北。寸　尺軸。人爭寳之。</p>
<p>蘇報之役。章太炎鄒容被拘入獄。鄒容瘦死獄中。虜炎昌熾。莫敢過問。劉三從容不迫。收尸葬於其故里華涇鄉黄葉樓傍。俠骨義行。炳耀千秋。民十一。于右任章太炎李印泉張溥泉章士釗等。親爲致祭。并泐碑紀念。太炎撰碑稱爲義士。蓋取典於龔定菴詩「劉三今義士」句也。</p>
<p>劉癖杯中物。酒量之豪。不亞於先德劉伶。以市上難得美酒。特自製用。每餐必。飲。飲至興高彩烈時。則引吭高歌。夫人陸靈素。知書習禮。尤精崑曲。夫唱婦隨。極人間之樂。劉嘗與畫師某賭酒爲戲。及餐畢。僕謂今日共飲去酒六十餘斤。酒量之豪。可以推想。</p>
<p>餘事吟詠。亦至可誦。爲錄數章。以概其餘。記得二首云。記得春明白渡橋。絳衣遮道問明朝。無端取别江南去。頓减嬌嬈一尺腰。江南三月亂鶯飛。翦取吳淞我又歸。買得龍華雙　子。桃花如雪撲春衣。贈靈素云。皖水湘江無限程。渠儂踪迹亦縱横。如何未盡飛騰意。要作黄龍萬里行。婦女荒唐不可聽。河山應鑑老劉伶。酒人枉自傳家法。甘隸妝臺訴醉醒。送曼殊之印度云。早歲耽禪見性眞。江山故宅獨愴神。擔經忽作圖南計。白馬投荒第二人。皆雋句也。</p>
<p>劉三與黄晦聞諸貞壯劉栽甫柳亞子沈</p>
<h3>成語趣解　·摒·秀</h3>
<p>鄰有梁氏子。博學巧思。擅雄辯。嘗謂「故事瓊林」書中。句多恰切時局。如「精衞啣石。比人之徒勞。」卽指汪精衞啣恨蔣介石。比擴大會議失敗。其人徒勞形神而已。又「他山之石可以攻玉。」指勢逼閻錫山他適之蔣介石。并可以攻退馮玉祥云云。妙語解頣。抑亦東方淳于之流亞也。（却酬）</p>
<h3>國界小事記　·海·客</h3>
<p>▲英京倫敦很有人提倡夜學。據最近調查。計有夜課班一萬起。教員八千人。學生二十五萬人。</p>
<p>▲美國有名的富豪專車。内有種種極精美極舒適的設備。裝有無綫電。接受最近市况。現在此車已毁。聞者惜之。</p>
<p>▲倫敦某旅館的小水池中。有一尾金魚。已存活三十年之久。可算是金魚中壽命最長者。現已移往白拉頓Ｂrightcn城某旅館保養。</p>
<p>▲大林頓Ｄarlington史託克頓Ｓtockton耶姆Ｙarm希爾屯Ｓhildn四鎭。據說是英國鐵路的産生之地。曾舉行百年紀念。盛極一時。</p>
<p>▲英國維多利亞女王最後一次到哀爾蘭京城都百林去。曾攝影片一卷。富有歷史上的趣味。現正由英人某君保藏着。當作珍寳一樣。</p>
<p>▲德國各地公共塲所中所有前廢皇的照片塑像等。自歐戰終了皇室傾覆以後。都完全移去或拆卸。</p>
<p>▲英國名劇「金錢數噸」。自編者編成後。遍送各大戲院。要求排演。都被拒絶。後由某戲院以廉價收買。排就出演。竟受大衆歡迎。單是倫敦一地。收入有十二萬金鎊之多。</p>

<h3>雪象頌贊　溥</h3>
<p>連日久雪不霽。其雪量爲近三十年來所未見。薄寒中人。固瑟縮堪憐。而圍罏酣飲。擁衾自安者流。輒以此爲戲。日前余友顧君旭初。堆一佛象。如菩薩低眉者。中虛。貫以電炬。下承以几。高約三尺餘。及夕。背景託以黑幕。喚邑廟旁汪開攝影家製成數片。分贈同好。亦雅人逸趣也。而余之隣右。有積雪以成美女象者。尤屬閨人韻事。余旣欣賞。不可無辭。爰志數語於下。</p>
<p>▲雪彌陀　飛錫來游。大地回春。萬千世界。琢玉堆銀。喚醒痴夢。洗盡紅塵。偶現色相。幻形分身。寒非乞薄。胸具冰心。開顔說法。去果來因。斜暉西照。起滅超俪。空山流水。始自歸眞。</p>
<p>▲雪美人　瓊樓宵夜。倩女生香。姑射丰姿。縞素練裳。才高咏絮。冰雪心腸。飛花身世。兀自悲凉。雨雲空憶。三生夢長。縱有風月。半面殘妝。爲問維摩。奚駐流芳。如斯僊侣。金屋難藏。</p>
<h3>孤山踏雪尋梅記</h3>
<p>何海生自杭寄</p>
<p>日前春雪紛飛。晝夜不绝。白皚皚玉宇瓊樓。杭垣幾成銀世界。西子湖亦爲生色不少。美景天然。益信爲人工藝術所不及。</p>
<p>余以天寒可耐。遂邀陸翟二君同往西湖玩雪。旣抵湖濱。遊舟絶跡。高山被雪。如御白裘。薄冰浮水面。墮風微漾。翟君欲赴孤山尋梅。陸君足健。步行直達其地。啜茗於孤山茶肆。梅分大紅。粉紅。綠。白。黄五色。雪積枝上。遠觀似皆白色。玉骨冰肌。飄飄欲仙。宜乎林處士愛之如妻也。余口占一絶云。「空亭寂寂孤山麓。玉骨冰肌萬樹梅。爲問風流林處士。月明可有鶴歸來。」旅展謁林處士墓。其旁有鶴塚。皆爲雪掩。淸風亮節。想見其爲人。吾三人臨雪憑弔。排徊久之。皆羨其一坏黄　。名留千古。得與西子湖同埀不朽也。</p>
<p>坐。乃步行返湖濱。晚餐於聚賢館。歸家已鐘鳴九下矣。（却酬）</p>
<h3>書壇淸話　鄉下人</h3>
<p>演講三國志之唐再良。亦屬光裕社中之中堅份子。原定國曆二月十七日與彈唱珍珠塔之沈儉安薛小卿合做前後擋。日間在邑廟羣玉樓。晚間在春風得意樓同日開書。詎沈薛二人。與演講金槍傅之汪雲峰。新換蘭譜。友誼甚篤。故公然宣言。與唐不願合作。待唐自擇。倘唐做羣玉樓日夜面。則沈薛與汪做得意樓。唐决定做得意樓。則沈等三人做羣玉。如唐欲日夜分做兩處。則沈等一處不做。偏偏兩處塲東。咸抱熊掌與魚兼欲主義。皆不肯讓步。後經朱耀庭等從中設法調停。就「人地相宜」四字上着眼。大約勸唐獨做羣玉。得意樓則由沈等三人承乏也。</p>
<p>大世界游藝塲。仍擬添置書塲邀趙小卿趙鶴孫等承乏。據傳二月十四號晚間。小卿父子之庽所（法租界格洛克路歸安里）忽遭盜刦。被搶去衣服首飾等。約値四五百金。小卿因不諳法律手續。故未報捕請緝。長安居不易。洵然。（未蓋章）</p>
<h3>菸草詼屑　嵇覲</h3>
<p>菸於衞生、百無一益。顧人皆喜之。近世以來。銷路日廣。而北美之佛爾吉尼亞。遂爲世界菸草之中心。相傳哥崙布未至美洲以前。歐西人士。素不吸菸。並不識菸草爲何物。自科氏還。有船主名賴賚者。携之至家。一日。嘗獨坐吸之。其</p>
<p>僕方奉盂進。見主人口鼻出烟。以爲火也。駭甚。不及呼救。卽傾盂中之水。猛澆其頂。賴氏莫知所以然已淋漓盡致矣。洵爲趣談。</p>
<p>自烟草輸入歐洲。舉國上下。大吸特吸。幾乎一日不可無此君之概。而佛爾吉尼亞供不應求。於是基阡的伊。北喀爾勒那迭佛司諸邦。亦無不開拓土地。廣爲種植。春初下種。秋末成熟。刈取而焙乾之。載以入市。總計一歲産額。當達美金二千六百四十兆圓以。其分銷於美洲者三之一。歐亞各洲者三之二也。數亦鉅矣。</p>
<p>烟草旣爲文明國人之消遣物。不知其中含有毒質甚富。如所謂尼哥丁者。據某西人云。一英厘可致二三人死命。所幸燃吸之時。經火焚去其半。然爲害亦不淺。吾人勞形筆墨。一枝在手。謂可助長文思。似未嘗感受受若何影響。迨至年事稍高。氣血已虧。漸成慢性炭養毒症。不可救治。此又講求衞生者所黨注意及之也。</p>
<p>▲短訊　歌舞家紫羅蘭女士。善京粤劇。名震南北。近在南京路市政廳聯合　閣名媛、曁哥舞明星大會串。賣　甚佳。節目如春深了。鴛鴦戲水。蛾眉月。桃李爭春。龍虎鬬。賣花詞。蝴蝶姑娘。天眞。愛的花。女士之粤劇陳妙常。京曲坐宫。蘇州小曲。諧劇半邊鷄。足尖舞。紫羅蘭舞等。均爲傑作云。（芮鴻初）</p>
<h3>南洋遊記（一二三）　花</h3>
<p>旅暹者以廣東潮州人爲多。亦有江浙會館。曾有一木工因建築木工其得暹王之信任。以致鉅富。因前暹王喜工程之美。不計値。但今暹工不然。凡事甚用計算。而後行之。暹王年少。曾遊學英備。能英語。但其任吾華人某君爲管理華人佛教事務者。並非精於佛教之人。只因其能暹語耳。</p>
<p>華人生活在外者。除商業外。工業亦甚堪注意。各地多有魯班廟。在暹緬印度均有可觀之木工業。多出於粤人之手。緬甸北部亦有以包土木工程致富者。有某君初辦文事。每月所入不過百元。爲英公司包工作工頭二年。致數萬矣。有一種木工。華人。乃能贏日本之錢甚盛。吾人在日本處處見日人所用皆細紅木傢具、無人無時不用之。若小几佛壇。尤爲普通。昔以爲日本所出。嗣乃知完全出於華人之手。其木料出於南洋。而製造地爲廣東上海。乃華人一種大出品也。又若象牙資石玉石等。均産自暹羅緬甸。華人經手運至上海廣東。由華工造成種種器皿乃出口赴歐美。由此觀之。華人工藝亦天然發達也。可惜不知進步方法耳。</p>
<p>十二日。至Ｖinton街參觀劉廣俗君之鋸木廠。以機器鋸爲之。資本二十萬元。據云今生意下落殆七八倍於昔日。考其原因。一部分受甘地抗英之影響。一切機器。印度人不用。建築等事均停頓。甘地乃復古派。辦法用開倒事打倒商業政策者。至在緬甸、華人鋸木業頗不少。大致均粤人。有李君者。兄弟均操此業。據云緬木有三種。第一種爲秈木。又曰麻栗。Ｔeak此木最堅牢。而價最趼用之造船面。非此不可。不畏衝撞。今銷路以英倫爲大宗。蓋用以造船。尤以造戰艦也余念世界一日不息戰。第一等美材必爲戰而犠牲矣。次一等爲丁沙木。Ｅng又次爲紅色木。Ｐonkato（譯緬音）此木均出自北緬。但非廣東木器之紅色木也。鐵道枕木甚合用。李君言中國一切建設之木料。宜自運之於緬甸。但我曾參觀日本東三省鋸木公司。資本百萬。知東省不乏大木材。惜未運出耳。</p>
<p>二十日。接勃生埠Ｂassein彭城劉氏會館劉庭璧信。請爲彭城劉氏作聯。余久思下鄉問俗。乃覆以電。卽到彭城會館。下午四時上船。二等艙九元。絶無招待。電扇不靈。室内不可容桌。且可怪者。並無冲凉所。然則白多用三倍之錢也。普通艙不到三元耳。蓋此一帶輪船之二等艙。還不如火車之大方也。遇一印度黑人。談英語甚好。略辯論。甚贊成民族平等及通婚主義。乃慨然曰。我乃爲人奴耳。無發言權也。沿河行見萍藻極多。大隊浮水中。甚爲美觀。時見斜陽影裏。各地黄色金塔。綠樹相映。此緬甸美景也。船向西南行。仰光隔岸大工塲不少。</p>
<p>二十一日晨勃生。劉棟賢（卽庭璧）同劉氏族多人在站候接。乘汽車至彭城會館。有二小學。云此間劉氏。凡數百家。棟賢母緬人。父閩安溪人。十五歲返國。在北京中國大學商科畢業。在中國十八年。復來緬甸。母久亡。而仍樂緬景物。余來勃生。與劉同住泉源號劉文堅處。劉乃彭城會館總理。是晚在館設宴。劉氏亦不甚多。因多在鄉下也。飯後乘汽車遊勃生各地。有飛機廠。在其北。有天主耶蘇各教堂。勃生乃緬甸西南角最大名港。地圖可見之。位印度與南洋之問。可通印度。歐美大艦直駛入内港。商業以米爲大宗。昔時英人曾欲建都於此以代仰光而不果。可以知其地位也。勃生地圖上作巴森。</p>

<h3>第一名　白完</h3>
<p>考試快要完畢了、</p>
<p>還剩有最後一課、這是不要預備、看書也、可以與考的一課、因此、大多數同學都坐在寢室裏閒談、從各人的疲倦的神彩、像得了失眠症的眼晴看來、考試給與同學們的印象、該是一個多麽厲害可怕的怪物、爲了牠、同學們該是吃過多少虧、費了多少心血、所以、在這快要完畢的時辰、她們好像是挑着一担重載放下來休息似的工人、大家都鬆了一口氣、心頭也覺得快樂舒暢多了、</p>
<p>她們這時在寢室裏所　問談的範圍、</p>
<p>大概不外要怎樣不輕易地放過這寒假的時間、以及如何補償在考試時預備功課所受的疲勞與玩的時間之損失、有的是談到回家後、同姐姐妹妹母親們、圍坐在一塊兒、過舊歷年是怎樣快樂、無家可歸的同學、則是商議邀幾個同學、組織一個寒假在校學生住宿會、預備怎樣把生活弄得藝術化、趣味化、她們很少有談到這次考試問題、因爲這事情、是被爲過去了、談起來太没意思了、或者使她們惱恨、總然有幾個同學心裏在懊悔某個試題、答錯了、或者在嫉妬别人考得第一、自已落第、</p>
<p>「喂、談這些預支的快樂、是没有意思、我有個提議、就是把此刻的空氣、弄快樂有趣點、你們贊不贊成、」</p>
<p>這時坐在靜的懷抱裏、像小孩子似的琳、忽地跳起來這麽說、</p>
<p>「好、我附議、」綽號尖嘴的瓊附和着說、</p>
<p>「我的提議是···」靜把琳的衣角一拉、意思是阻止她不要說、琳自己呢、則望着坐在寢室東角下沉思的芬微笑、</p>
<p>「說喲、趕快地說、」尖嘴在俗促、</p>
<p>「我不說、唉、太可憐了、等一會我說了恐怕還要哭哩、」琳聽了靜的吩咐、生了下來、</p>
<p>「不行、說這樣半頭話會短命死、而且使我們都莫明其妙、」一個呌做英說、　　而尖嘴則起身拉着琳、要她非說不可、</p>
<p>「好、我說、」琳終於說了、她的眼光始終没有離開芬、「我的提議、是我們空坐在這裏太枯燥了、何不想法了弄點錢、買些東西、大家來吃一頓、」</p>
<p>「法子安在、」著名好吃大王麗連忙問、</p>
<p>「法子就是、」琳望着芬笑了、「誰是這次考試第一名、誰請客、」</p>
<p>「好的、好的、·········」</p>
<p>「贊成、贊成、·········」</p>
<p>大有都把眼睛望着芬說、因爲芬這次考試、分數得的最多、</p>
<p>「現在我們來審察誰是我們這次考試的第一名、」英故意地說、</p>
<p>除了芬、還有誰、每項功課、不都是她的第一、」尖嘴直截了曾說、</p>
<p>那麽、請我芬第一趕快犧牲幾隻道羅請客哩、」好吃大王麗的聲音、</p>
<p>芬、拿錢出來請客、」大家都這樣說、</p>
<p>這時芬却不慌不忙的、「可以的、幾塊錢不算什麽、但是此刻我一文也没有改日再請、好吧、」</p>
<p>「不行、不行、此刻就要吃、」</p>
<p>「没有錢我借給你、」</p>
<p>大家都圍着芬、硬要她馬上拿出錢來、芬則堅持着不答應、</p>
<p>「喂、你們大家不會辦事、」這時那首先阻止琳提議的靜也說話了、「你們要人家請客、你們自己先要送禮道賀、然後愁她不拿出錢來、」</p>
<p>學生將運動員所習科别而指派導師、此導師朝夕伴同學生、將學生在講堂上所聽而未明白、或因事而未上課之功課、每日覆授一遍、其功課内之習題、臨時代運動員講明、務使完全明白其困難、不遇考試時、再將全書重要諸點、完全提出、使之覆習、可以應考、該校此舉、對於運動員之功課、補助殊多、將來運動考試成績、不致過劣、服務社會、亦可本其所用而應用、向該校校長云、運動員爲校犧牲功課、殊屬可憫、若不予以補救、則成績過劣、不得升級畢業、若隨便予以升級畢業、校規又所不許、是以定出此辦法、導師大半係該校近數屆畢業生、</p>
<h3>獻給將嫁的Ｘ姑娘　石夷</h3>
<p>冰冷冷的嚴寒的天氣、正吹着刮人肌膚的厲風、浸沈在這灰色的空氣裏、使人感覺到冷而戰慄、許多的朋友近在勳勳的火爐旁拷着火、我却獨自伏在書桌上、寫這給一個朋友的祝福、</p>
<p>姑娘、我曾和你做一度的好友、在西大學的時期、你是被男同學們所贊美的所謂大學之花、你是轟動全校的摩登女士、姑娘、你在那時候、是多麽的風俏、是多麽美麗、披着滿肩的柔髮、露着一個圓圓的蘋果似嬌嫩的臉子、兩個靈活得要滾出來的眼珠好像藴藏着無限的情意、</p>
<p>薄薄的嘴唇時常露着編貝似潔白的細牙、穿着中西合化的旗袍、高跟的皮鞋、使同學們甘拜於石榴裙下、着時你又富於詩的天才、被人稱你爲女詩人、在西馬路上時常可以看到你的華艶的玉影、而且你是個伶俐潑的女孩子、深信着善於交際的蜜絲、我可以在此地從回憶中說出許多的話來、</p>
<p>你的宿舍中、常常有遠處八方渴慕着聖者的友人來、更其我們本校的同學、我記得你的寢室、是一個小小四方糊着藝術化的壁紙、黏着電影的像片、還襯着各色的紙花、在壁的一隅放着一個鐵林、紅的綠的漂亮的被面、中間放下一個寫字檯、上面擺着許多裝飾品、使到過的人没一個不稱贊你的臥室、「蜜絲Ｘ、你眞是天賦的聰穎、富於藝術的天才、一個很平凡的屋子裏、你會佈置得這樣精緻、」又是一個接續着說、「Ｘ女士的文學很好呢、你不見中央日報時常發表的詩嗎、」那時候、你是很驕傲的獲得同學們的奬勵、姑娘、過去却你是値得驕傲的在生命史中很光榮的一頁、</p>
<p>我最近聽到一個好消息、在最近的時期裏、你將要碰到一個幸福的日子、你將披着輕飄的茜色喬其紗、美麗時式的服裝、握着你的新人的手在大禮堂中、你這富於熱情的姑娘、爲着愛他把你的少女的潔愛交給他、爲了這、將嫁的Ｘ姑娘、在你未嫁之前、我要誠懇的祝福你、對你說、你莫忘了、在你過去的生命裏、是何等的榮幸、何等的光明、我希望你的温柔紅艶的光華、永是照耀生命的如日月之燦爛着、我希望你的美麗的靑春、永遠收藏在玫瑰花的園子裏、讓這四邊春水的環繞、永存着鮮明的花朶、我更禱祈着我的朋友在女界中謀一線之光明、在女作家中現着人們的歡誦、以你倆愛的眞摯、永遠保存着人間的幸福、以你倆愛的熱情、建設着將來偉大的事業、姑娘、你看到這簡短的替你祝頌話、便是從我心靈裏流露給你的一些兒輕薄的贈禮、你莫忘了、她是和你曾在過去的友誼之島上做過一時期的摯侣、她在滬西之一隅全誠意的祝福你、</p>

<p>法將福煦歐戰日記（續）　顧昂若譯</p>
<p>第二軍逐漸恢復牠的信任心、杜歇斯到了更有良好的效力、軍中已不再談退却了、退却是我所明明白白不許的、騎兵没有充分的胆量、</p>
<p>你怎嗎時候要我、我就可回到羅密萊、不過我這裏的軍隊還没有列陣、還没有恢復前進、所以我不能抽身、我們戰區很廣、要從但塞克經過列黎直到諾昂、因此許多意外事故發生是可能的、福煦、</p>
<p>再者丨倘使你准許和法蘭樞將軍贊同、我主張我們的左翼（第十軍）以多那義我渥幾斯爲目標從列黎向喜爾持脫河前迨、英軍向列黎城北前進、從多那義經考拉義列成一綫、這樣法英比支隊可在喜爾特脫河水者雷斯河的左岸呵成一氣、</p>
<p>因爲法蘭樞總指揮希望在十月十日有一個軍團（第二軍團）和兩個騎兵師在裴塞内與愛爾之間接戰、十月十二日第三軍團和兩個騎兵師在裴塞内與聖渥美爾之間接戰、我們遂在十日配列兵馬準備立卽進攻和肅淸陣綫、佈置的詳情如下、</p>
<p>在聯軍現在狀况之下、第一件應當做的事情是小心翼翼的完成比英法軍的聯合、聯軍受近來幾役的影響已是分散了、</p>
<p>列黎之北面和東面的區域、喜爾特脫和雷斯兩河之間、似爲這次作戰的適當的戰塲、</p>
<p>假使明天十一日和後天十二日法國第十軍的左翼得着英軍（第二百團和師兵團）的援助、能在裴塞内莫爾未綫作戰、那末通列黎的道路可望肅淸、</p>
<p>在另一方面、莫爾未海慈白洛克卡塞爾綫（那是我們的防區）的北面區域、看來没有重兵駐紥在這狀况之下、十三日的早晨、法軍的左翼可信能向列黎前進、後來再向多那義前進、英軍的右翼則向列黎北面的區域前進、後來再向新廟前進、英軍的中央則向考拉義前進、</p>
<p>以多那義控制喜爾特脫河更以考拉義控制雷斯河、英法比軍隊可以從容在兩河後方會合、</p>
<p>倘使英軍的前敵總司令贊同這些計劃　法軍就可以在渥斯脫爾未好屯凡幾諧爾勃西列黎多那義路綫以及南面的路綫行動、英軍可用北面的路綫、　　上述計劃請爲批准、福煦、</p>
<p>法蘭樞爵士頗能以全力敏疾的援助法軍作戰、不過因爲下車的遲緩、英國第三軍團第一師直到十三日的下午、方始集齊、直到十五日的晚上、全軍方始準備前進（未完）</p>

<h3>East Railway Board Meeting</h3>
<p>Dispute Over the Scope of the Director-General's Authority</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the afternoon of the 19th, at 1:00 PM, the East Railway Board held a meeting. All Russian board members attended, while only half of the Chinese board members were present. The Russian Director of the Railway Bureau, Rudyi, spoke, requesting that the Director-General's Office of the East Railway be in a supervisory position and not have the authority to directly order the various departments of the Railway Bureau. Regarding the establishment of a Translation Department within the Railway Bureau, while the regulations can be reviewed by the Director-General, personnel matters should fall under the purview of the Railway Bureau. The recent recruitment of translators by the Director-General's Office was not handled by the Director of the Bureau and should be considered invalid. The Railway Bureau should issue an order to re-examine. The Chinese board members argued for a long time, but without result. The discussion will continue on the afternoon of the 20th. The Russian side insisted as before. Finally, it was decided to resolve the matter at a general meeting when Mo Dehui returns. Furthermore, the Chinese side's proposal to add personnel to various departments was also rejected. None of the translators recruited by the Director-General's Office of the East Railway have reported for duty. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Commanders Agree to Postpone the Establishment of the Military Commission</h3>
<p>Song and Sun's Troops are Unwilling to Leave Shanxi</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The various army and division commanders have agreed to organize the military headquarters according to the Tianjin Agreement. The establishment of the military commission is to be postponed for the time being. The organizational chart of the military headquarters has already been issued by Liao. (Special dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) In the morning, Fu Zhan Kui inspected Pang Bingxun's troops in Tunzhen Bao Store, and in the afternoon, he went to Jincheng to inspect Sun Dianying's troops. He plans to return to Bing on the 22nd and then go to Yuncheng to inspect Song Zheyuan's troops. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan requested that the headquarters of the army be located in Yuncheng, Hedong. The Shanxi Provincial Committee has not yet agreed because, according to the original Tianjin Agreement, after Song's troops are reorganized, they must move to the Pinghan Line. They are concerned that Song's troops will remain in Hedong for too long, so they have not agreed. Song's side said that the original Tianjin Agreement stipulated that the nine division commanders of Shanxi had requested a change to add a road protection garrison. Therefore, the army's slightly delayed departure from Shanxi should not be considered a change to the original agreement. Sun Dianying requested that the division headquarters be located in Taiyuan and that an office be established in Beiping to liaise with the Deputy Minister at any time. (Special dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shanxi verification officers said that the Yan and Feng troops in Shanxi are organized into five armies in total. Initially, they thought there were too many soldiers, but upon arriving at the units, they realized that the number of soldiers was still insufficient, while there were many lower-level officers. There were even company units where the number of officers was equal to the number of soldiers. Moreover, it is not easy to recruit soldiers to replenish the ranks in Shanxi. Some sixty-year-olds and twelve- or thirteen-year-olds are filling the ranks. It is only necessary to eliminate the weak and retain the strong. The number of soldiers is less than ten divisions, it is said. The Shanxi constabulary is organized into eight battalions, with Ding Li Runfa appointed as the deputy commander of the constabulary. Surplus military officers are being sent to Ping. (Special dispatch of the 20th)</p>

<h3>News of Sino-US Loans</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign circles have confirmed that the League of Nations' loan has no impact. However, some Chinese and foreign financiers are secretly colluding. If successful, it will be used to change the gold standard. In reality, where is the loan? As for the US silver loan, the capitalists have been prepared for a long time. However, the US is unwilling to come forward alone in terms of loan methods and must have international relations so that the principal and interest can be heavily guaranteed. As soon as this proposal came out, the five countries of the International New Silver Group visited American banks, hoping to participate. As a result, there is more discussion and more complications. The US is also not at ease investing in China and is reluctant to accept it. Therefore, it was changed to entrust Lincoln to first negotiate a small loan of 20 million yuan, hoping that the US would lend it alone without the involvement of other countries. However, the US believes that the amount is too small, which is irrelevant to raising the price of silver, and has little impact on China's purchasing power. Moreover, China has not yet repaid the principal and interest of the US two-rate tobacco and alcohol loans, which is quite worrying. Therefore, the New York Silver Council telegraphed again yesterday and the day before, hoping to handle a large loan and participate in international relations. In this case, China may not be willing to accept it. The loan agreement that has been rumored in the south, but those involved in foreign banking groups do not believe it. (Special dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Telecommunications Negotiations</h3>

<h3>The Right to Hire Personnel at the Salt Inspection Office</h3>
<p>Foreigners Must Not Interfere</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to information from the Ministry of Finance, the British House of Commons' attention to the replacement of the Salt Inspectorate's co-organizer is a misunderstanding. During the Peking Government period, the office was originally under the jurisdiction of the creditor countries to guarantee the salt administration as collateral for borrowing money. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, all foreign debts were fully handled by the Ministry of Finance. The nature of the office should be changed and directly managed by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance should be in charge of personnel and administration. Foreigners must not interfere.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Spanish Imperial Cabinet</h3>
<p>The war between autocracy and republic has always lasted for years or decades before it can be resolved. The autocratic party has a vast and deeply rooted force, which cannot be overthrown in a short period of time. Even when they are exhausted, they must still collect their remnants to contend. It will not stop until it is trapped in a desperate situation. This is true of all past events. However, the politics of autocracy will not shake. If once the people's hearts are shaken and tend toward republicanism, then even if its government has the power of ten thousand catties and an army of unanimous hearts, it will eventually gradually dissolve and return to submission. During this period, it is struggling to support itself and using all kinds of oppressive forces and trying to think of all kinds of restraints in order to try to recover from the decline. As a result, it is just a tumultuous disturbance and prolongs the people's unnecessary suffering.</p>
<p>However, the authorities of autocracy will never retreat after seeing the situation in advance, such as the republican movement in Spain. It can be said that it has been lurking for a long time. With the overthrow of the Rivera cabinet, the hearts of the people of Spain can be seen. However, the King of Spain did not realize it and asked Berenguer to maintain it afterward. It is known that the autocratic system has no room for existence until the Berenguer cabinet cannot be maintained and falls. However, the King of Spain still does not realize it, and he organizes the so-called imperialist centralized military cabinet, trying to use more severe means to suppress the masses and fight the republicans. Even if the Republicans are temporarily subdued by them and remain silent, the more oppressed, the stronger the reaction. Once it breaks out, it will still reach the point of being unbearable to clean up. Moreover, the Republicans have already expressed such things as a national general strike, and it is not easy to subdue them in the present. Therefore, although the new cabinet in Spain has been formed, there are many worries.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Spanish New Cabinet Announces Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Calling for the handling of elections</p>
<p>The fundamentals of republicanism are shaken.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Madrid, 20th - After a five-hour meeting, the new Asna cabinet issued a statement announcing that it would immediately handle municipal elections with universal suffrage and then hold general elections to elect members to revise the constitution. The new cabinet intends to completely abolish the dictatorship and stipulate responsibilities. It also intends to submit a special plan on Catalan autonomy to the revised constitutional chamber. The light of King Alfonso's victory is now particularly visible. Although the Socialist Party and the Republican Party do not admit defeat, they have at least temporarily lost power because they have missed the current excellent opportunity. The King's strong enemy is Guerla, but the King asked him to form a cabinet and allowed him to meet with all the political prisoners in prison. However, Guerla failed to form a new cabinet, so Spanish republicanism was fundamentally shaken. Anyone who hates the king can no longer blame the king for completely disregarding the situation.</p>
<h3>The British Boxer Indemnity Allocation Case</h3>
<p>Passed the third reading in the Lower House</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 19th - The Chinese indemnity allocation case, that is, the Boxer indemnity of over three million pounds returned to China, passed the third reading in the Lower House today. Foreign Office Under-Secretary Dalton accepted the amendment proposed by the Conservative Party that the Board of Trustees should have British members, but the Liberal Party's proposal to purchase railway materials should not be paid for with this money, and the request to arrange the arrears of Chinese railway loans, was rejected by Dalton because this proposal would leave British workers idle. It should be until the creditors, who are not entirely British, have received the arrears. The loan matter can be negotiated with the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs in the future. The Liberal Party then withdrew its amendment. Dalton then put forward an amendment regarding subsidies to Chinese universities, which was passed by the public. This amendment stipulates (1) the exchange of Chinese and British male and female lecturers, (2) assisting Chinese students studying in the UK to be entertained, (3) guiding Chinese students on academic matters, (4) promoting and facilitating the teaching of Chinese languages ​​in British universities, and (5) generally encouraging closer intellectual cooperation between China and the UK and promoting cultural relations between the two countries. This case is based on the report of the Chinese Indemnity Committee, which advocates that the refunded money should be used to improve Chinese education and promote Chinese industry, especially focusing on railway construction.</p>

<h3>Reorganization Content of Sun Dianying's Troops</h3>
<p>▲Zhang Zhao and Sun went to Shenyang to negotiate salary matters</p>
<p>▲Sun established an office in Shenyang</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Sun Dianying previously sent representative Wang Shiping to Shenyang. On the 12th, he submitted the revised table of organization for the 2nd Infantry Division of the Army and met with Deputy Commander Zhang to report on the progress of the troop's reorganization in accordance with orders and to request instructions on defense zone salary needs, etc. Zhang greatly commended the troop for its rapid reorganization and approved the request. All new seals of office for the troop and the appointment of officers above the rank of battalion commander will be issued soon. The defense zone will have to wait for overall planning, and salary and provisions will be provided first to maintain the status quo, but the amount has not yet been determined. As for the monthly salary needs, Zhang instructed Sun Dianying to come to Shenyang to decide in person and then forward the request to the central government for approval and allocation on a monthly basis. Wang expressed his gratitude and immediately telegraphed Sun about his meeting with Zhang. The division is now scheduled to set up an office in Shenyang, which will be established soon. Wang is the representative stationed in Shenyang. Sun is expected to arrive in Shenyang in five or six days. According to Wang, the content of the troop's reduction is as follows: The troop used to be three armies and eight divisions with more than 40,000 soldiers and a long history. In the ideal of ordinary people, it seems difficult to reorganize this time, but in practice, there is no obstacle. Now our troop has been reorganized into the 2nd Army Division, commanding two brigades and seven regiments, and a separate independent battalion directly under the division headquarters. This reorganization retains about 30,000 people, and the remaining 10,000 people are currently equipped with 22,000 rifles and 5,000 box guns. Sun is the division commander, Jin Huandong, the former commander of the 14th Army, is now the deputy division commander, Liu Yueting, the former commander of the 17th Army, is now the commander of the 4th Brigade, Yu Shiming, the former commander of the 5th Division, is now the commander of the 3rd Brigade, and Yue Xiangru, the former commander of the 24th Army, requested to reorganize a regiment on his own. Feng Yangtian, the former division commander, is now the chief of staff. In addition, Deputy Commander Zhang has made many accommodations for the division's generals, approving the establishment of two major general deputy brigade commanders, Liu Rijun is the deputy brigade commander of the 4th Brigade, and Wang is the deputy brigade commander of the 3rd Brigade. The remaining officers and soldiers are being disbanded. This time, Chairman Ji Yiqiao, the inspection commissioner, provided a lot of assistance to our troop's reorganization. Recently, Deputy Commander Zhang sent Fu Xingqiao, a special commissioner to inspect our troop and Pang Bingxun's troop, who passed through Tianjin on the 8th to go to Pingjin. Because I had already arrived in Tianjin before the 8th, I did not meet him. It is estimated that Cheng Fu has already arrived in Bing. The troops are currently stationed in Punan, Jincheng, Gaoping, and Qinshui counties, and salary and provisions are quite difficult. I was sent to Shenyang and will be stationed in Shenyang for a long time, etc. As for Shi Yousan, because the salary and reduction issues have not been completely resolved, he will not leave Shenyang for the time being, and plans to meet with Sun in Shenyang for consultation (February 16).</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong's Army Has Actually Started Entering Jiangxi</h3>

<h3>Tragic Ferry Sinking in Guangdong's Jiujiang</h3>
<p>▲Seventy to eighty male and female passengers drowned</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The waterways of the West River in Guangdong Province are difficult to navigate every winter when the river water is shallow and dry. One must first survey the water level before daring to sail. However, the river water has been dry these days, and the weather is bad, with mist filling the sky. The Xiangji ferry on the route between Guangzhou and Jiujiang encountered danger on the morning of the 14th, and seventy to eighty passengers drowned. According to reports, the ferry left the province for home at 11:00 p.m. on the 13th, fully loaded with goods and more than 400 passengers. At about 4:00 p.m. on the 14th, while passing through the Weiyong River and arriving at the Sancao Estuary near Sanhongqi in Shunde, the rear of the hull suddenly hit a reef with a loud bang. River water gushed in. The driver urgently sounded the alarm, and the Xin Jiujiang, a small tugboat towing the ferry, immediately cut the cable and returned to rescue. At that time, most of the passengers were awakened from their dreams and were at a loss. The young and strong struggled to escape from the cabins and climbed out. At the same time, the ferrymen tore down the awning of the boat, and most of the passengers fled to the outside of the awning. At this time, the Xin Jiujiang small tugboat approached the boat and ferried the refugees to the tugboat, rescuing seventy to eighty people. At the same time, the Gaoming Lianxing Ferry and the Heshan Ferry, which were sailing on the river, also approached to rescue, rescuing more than 200 people. In addition, the Guanghua patrol ship stationed on the river heard the alarm and sailed to assist in the rescue. It is estimated that about 300 of the passengers in distress were rescued, and 70 to 80 people are still missing, presumably drowned. The Jiujiang Xiangji Ferry sank to the bottom of the water in an instant, only exposing the mast and the guard room at the stern. The goods have been lost, with losses estimated at 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Those who survived immediately took the Gaoming and Heshan ferries back to the province to make other plans to return to their hometowns. Those rescued by the Xin Jiujiang small tugboat sailed to Le Lou in Shunde to disembark. He, the director of the Jiujiang Xiangji Ferry, was fortunately familiar with the water and followed the land route to Le Lou, and then took a local ferry from Le Lou to the province to report the situation and location of the accident. The Xiangji Ferry's office in the province immediately asked the Chengxi Convenience Hospital to send personnel with coffins to retrieve the bodies. The company also hired four raft boats, which were towed by the Xin Jiujiang tugboat to prepare to raise the sunken Xiangji Ferry to the surface of the water. The commissioner of the Convenience Hospital and the workers immediately went to the scene of the accident to collect the corpses (February 16).</p>
<h3>Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Telegram Requesting Correction of Ministry's Reply on Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on Jiang Dayi, requesting relief, because the proposed tax rate for the business tax in Jiangsu Province was too different from the outline stipulated by the Ministry. The telegram was divided into three points. Yesterday, it received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Finance: "Jiang Dai's telegram is noted. The outline of business tax in various provinces and the supplementary measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan and circulated to all provinces and cities. The draft business tax regulations of Jiangsu Province have been sent to the Ministry by the provincial government. If the business classification, tax standards, and tax rates violate the provisions of the outline and supplementary measures, the Ministry will revise them separately and reply to the provincial government for transmission to the Finance Department for compliance. The business tax implemented in various provinces and cities should be investigated and handled in accordance with the outline and supplementary measures approved by the Executive Yuan. The discrepancies mentioned in the telegram are misunderstandings. This should be replied to. 1. Article 4 of the outline stipulates the classification standards and tax rates for luxury businesses and other businesses with restrictive properties. Each province and city should formulate them separately according to the situation and report them to the Ministry for review and filing before they can be implemented. The Business Tax Review Committee is set up separately in areas where business tax collection has already been started. Its authority is only to assess whether the tax amount calculated by the collection agency is accurate and all disputes of taxpayers. It has no power to formulate regulations and tax rates. If merchants and people want to present their opinions in advance, they can directly submit them to the competent authority for approval and processing. This should be replied to. 2. The supplementary measures of the outline stipulate that the procedures for collecting business tax are already very strict. The Ministry has also revised the draft regulations submitted by Jiangsu Province in detail. Whether taxing according to the amount of capital or the amount of business, the total amount of tax payable for the whole year should be determined when receiving or renewing the business license in accordance with Article 3 of the supplementary measures, divided into twelve months, and one-tenth should be collected each month, which is the same as the meaning of the telegram saying that the tax rate is calculated according to the stipulated tax rate for the whole year. There should be no ambiguity. 3. In short, the outline of business tax and supplementary measures are formulated by the Ministry with reference to the domestic commercial situation and economic conditions. If the regulations of various provinces exceed the scope stipulated by the Ministry, they should be corrected at any time, so as to consider both national tax and commercial difficulties. Please ask the Chamber of Commerce to inform all industries and forward them to the famous chambers of commerce in Suzhou for information. Finance Department seal."</p>
<p>Also, the Chamber of Commerce previously stated that factory silk is one of the foreign trade items and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in winter, requesting exemption from special tax and business tax on factory silk. The Ministry also telegraphed on the same day, "The telegram from Dongdai is noted. Article 1 of the outline of business tax in various provinces stipulates that those who have already paid special taxes and donations to the central government are excluded. If silk factories and silk fabric factories have already paid special taxes to the central government, all manufacturing industries and their directly established wholesale industries can be exempted from business tax. Wholesale industries and retail industries in the goods sales industry should still be taxed to show the difference. In addition to revising the draft business tax regulations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces separately and replying to the provincial governments for transmission to the Finance Department for compliance, please be informed. Finance Ministry seal."</p>
<h3>Implementation of Unified Tax Collection in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>▲Unified Tax Inspection Office established in Bengbu</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: After the Ministry of Finance issued an order to all provinces and cities across the country to abolish Lijin, the newly implemented unified taxes on cigarettes, wheat flour, cotton yarn, matches, and cement have been successively levied in most provinces. Because of the depression of industry in northern Anhui, only the Xinfeng and Baoxing flour mills in Bengbu and the Dailai Tobacco Company and the Huaishang Match Company in Linhuai Pass collect factory taxes locally. Wheat flour used to be a special tax, collected at the factory. The former Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Wheat Flour Special Tax Bureau sent four staff members to reside in Xinfeng and Baoxing mills, two in each mill, to collect wheat flour factory tax. After the establishment of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau in Shanghai, the director, Wang Zongzhu, recently reassigned Xue Yunpeng, the tax inspector of the former Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Wheat Flour Special Tax Bureau stationed in Xinfeng, assistant Hu Zhenxin, Zhang Siying, the tax inspector stationed in Baoxing, and assistant Ding Xiangsheng as clerks. After Xue and others completed the transfer, they continued to stay in the factory to collect taxes. Wheat flour leaving the factory is taxed at 10 cents per bag. The Dailai Tobacco Company and Huaishang Match Company also sent staff to the factory to collect factory taxes. Cigarettes produced by Dailai are taxed according to the third-class cigarette, that is, 39 yuan of cigarette unified tax vouchers are affixed to a large box of 50,000 cigarettes. The factory tax rate for matches is divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A is taxed at 5 yuan per large box, Type B is taxed at 7.5 yuan per large box, and Type C is taxed at 10 yuan per large box. As for cement and cotton yarn, there have been no products so far, so there is no factory tax to be levied. In order to prevent tax evasion, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau specially set up a Unified Tax Inspection Office in Bengbu and appointed He Wenbo, the director of the Bengbu Cigarette Unified Tax Inspection Office, as the director. After He was appointed, he merged and reorganized the original Cigarette Unified Tax Inspection Office and took office on the 17th. He issued a notice stating that in addition to the cigarette item continuing to be handled as before, all imports and exports of other items such as cotton yarn, wheat flour, matches, and cement should be reported to the office for inspection and registration in accordance with the cigarette reporting and inspection procedures (February 18).</p>

<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Ferry capsizes a firewood boat. The Louan shuttle ferry operated by Tang Hongru of Anting, while passing through the intersection of Wangxian Bridge and Laqi Gu Pu on the 14th, collided with a firewood boat belonging to Xia Amu from Tianfu Temple in Kunshan. Xia immediately fell into the river. The ferry disregarded him, and continued on. The weather was that of the first clear day after a heavy snowfall, with no people in sight. No one was there to help, leading to his drowning. Later, someone reported this to Xia's family, who came and recovered the body and reported it to the Second Public Security Bureau. The county government instructed Judge Zhang to lead the police to conduct an on-site examination. When the ferry passed Wangxian Bridge again, it was stopped by Xia's family, and the driver was handed over. Judge Zhang then took him back to the county government for questioning.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Records of Profits and Losses of Various Industries in Suzhou. At the end of this year, the total business volume of the ten largest silk and satin businesses in Suzhou was over 1.9 million. Tongrenhe in Guanqian had a profit of 6,000 yuan, while Tianxiang lost 10,000 yuan. Qiantai Xiang suffered particularly heavy losses due to the construction of a new building (the value of the building reached 100,000 yuan). Yu Lun in Changmen lost 4,000 yuan, and the rest were average. The rice industry suffered the most significant losses among all industries due to the impact of declining wheat and rice prices. Only Sanfeng in Fengmen made a profit of 30,000 yuan. The rest, such as Wanyuan and Zhaoyuan, did not suffer losses because of their involvement in wheat. The gold industry, dealing in gold bars, generally had profits, with Tiancheng in Guanqian making about 4,000 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The head of the stamp tax bureau is about to be replaced again. The stamp tax bureau in this county was originally contracted by He Mengjue, a local, for 12,000 yuan per year. Last December, the Department of Finance appointed Wang Erxie from Hangzhou as the new head of the bureau, increasing the tax amount by 2,400 yuan per year. When Wang came to Changshu to take office, it was during the Lunar New Year, and newspapers were suspended. Wang started inspections without notice, and many cases of tax evasion were discovered. The penalties imposed were perceived by the inspected households as illegal. They filed complaints with the Department of Finance, which sent officials to Changshu for a secret investigation. Recently, Director Wang, sensing widespread dissatisfaction, decided to resign. He submitted his resignation to the headquarters a few days ago, and it was reportedly approved. The vacancy has been filled by Zhu Shijia from Suzhou, who will come to Changshu soon to take over.</p>
<p>Telephone Damage After Snow. This county has experienced several heavy snowfalls this winter and spring. As of today, there have been seven snowfalls, with the sixth being the most severe. Farmlands in various villages have suffered losses. The most significant loss, however, has been to the telephone system. Craftsmen have been repairing it for five days, but only a portion of the urban area has been restored. The rural lines will take more time. About 300 telephone poles have been knocked down in areas like Mei and Dongbang Shenjia Market. The rural lines will be addressed after the urban lines are repaired, which will take at least half a month and cost over 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Gamblers in Nanli Resist Arrest and Assault Police. The Changxing Garden Teahouse and Chess Hall, located outside the South Gate Qingming Bridge and operated by Shao Ronggen, has recently been running a large gambling den during the Lunar New Year holiday, profiting from the rake. At about 9 p.m. the day before yesterday, Inspector Lei Jiaju of the Public Security Bureau discovered this and sent Inspector Wang Xiezhong and a team of detectives to make arrests. Four gamblers and gambling paraphernalia were apprehended on the spot. As they were being taken to the bureau, a group of escaped gamblers dared to resist arrest, severely beating detective Jiang Fugeng, who spat blood. The clothes of Gai Deshun and others were torn, and the four gamblers who had been caught were also snatched away. Afterwards, the detectives immediately took the owner Shao Ronggen and the waiter Feng Aquan to the bureau. The head of the Second Section, Wang Zhonghu, opened court and questioned them. Shao and Feng both confessed to gambling. Wang ordered their detention for further investigation based on their confessions.</p>
<p>Hu Diao Unable to Support Herself, Forced to Eat Kerosene Porridge. Lang Xueji, a resident of No. 88, South City Bridge, in this city, has been working in the countryside. His wife, Lei Shi, stays at home to watch the house. Gong Zhengyuan often brings wine to their house for excessive drinking and has been wantonly harassing his wife. When Lei Shi refused, Gong became enraged and resorted to poisoning her. He secretly put kerosene in her porridge and forced her to eat it, causing her to become poisoned and bedridden. Lang Xueji learned of this and reported it to the First Police Station of the First Public Security Bureau. Gong Zhengyuan was immediately arrested and sent to the headquarters. Yesterday, he was transferred to the court for questioning. Gong Zhengyuan firmly denied putting kerosene in the porridge and forcing Lang Lei Shi to eat it. After the interrogation, he was ordered to be detained. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhu and Coroner Shen went to the Wu family to conduct an examination. The examination confirmed that Wu Lei Shi was poisoned by kerosene and was in critical condition. He instructed her husband, Wu Xueji, to send Lei Shi to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Coastal Counties and Cities Along the River and Sea Prohibited from Demolishing City Walls. The Wuxi County Government decided to demolish the city walls at the second county administration meeting. Local merchants and residents telegraphed to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting a postponement due to the ongoing banditry. Commander Zhuang issued an order that coastal areas and cities along the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake that are strategically important should not be demolished until the national defense plan is finalized. Recently, due to the Suzhou city wall case, the headquarters issued another order to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to relay to all counties a ban on demolishing city walls. The Wuxi County Government received this instruction yesterday.</p>
<p>Appeal from the Families of the Victims of the Hengyi Shipwreck. The families of the victims of the Qinli Company's Hengyi steamboat stated that the customs only allowed twelve passengers on board. After the accident, there were seventeen or eighteen survivors, and more than ten people drowned. This clearly exceeded the permitted number of passengers. Moreover, the bodies of the deceased passengers were submerged in the water for thirty-six hours. The situation was unprecedentedly tragic. All believed that the company should bear full responsibility, but so far, it has ignored the issues of compensation and other aftermath matters, causing great indignation. They have separately hired lawyers and filed lawsuits with the county court to seek legal remedies. They have also jointly organized the Hengyi Steamboat Disaster Victims Association to handle matters and appealed to all sectors of society for fair assistance. The Hengyi steamboat was leased by Taili Company from the Northeast Company for a monthly rent of 260 yuan. The ship suddenly sank, and a crane was used for days to lift the entire ship. However, due to the bodies inside the cabins, it was difficult to retrieve them, so axes were used to chop open the ceilings. The ship has been completely destroyed. It is reported that the ship was worth over 5,000 yuan, and Chen Xiangchun, the representative of the Northeast Company, has had serious negotiations with Taili Company, demanding compensation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The County Magistrate's Order to Demolish the Moon City Wall is Revoked. The Construction Bureau, in order to facilitate traffic, had decided at a county administration meeting to demolish the four city gates. Bids had been submitted, and the construction start date was set. However, the First District Party Headquarters submitted a request to the higher Party Headquarters through the County, stating that the General Headquarters had ordered that coastal county cities were related to national defense and should not be moved. Jiangyin was the second most important fortress along the Yangtze River, and national defense was more important than traffic. The county government approved the county council's official letter and immediately ordered the Construction Bureau to revoke the previous demolition plan of the Moon City Wall in this county.</p>
<p>Collapse of a House at the Sanxin Bathhouse Injures People. The Sanxin Bathhouse on Rainbow Bridge Road in the city was old and in disrepair. It collapsed suddenly yesterday (the 18th) at about 6 p.m. due to the pressure of several weeks of rain and snow. The bathhouse was full of customers. Shang Yunliang, a famous opera singer, and Lao Zhang, a pedicure worker, were trapped in the rubble. Fortunately, they were rescued quickly and survived. Customers at the nearby Meixin Bathhouse fled naked.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Baoying Representatives Request a Change in the Course of the Dam. Bao Sishui Town, located forty li from the city, is a town along the canal in the county. Recently, the Canal Engineering Office planned to dredge a section of the canal south of Sishui, intending to build a dam at Zhangcheng's Sishui. Residents of the town believed that the location of the dam, being upstream, would be very harmful to the town. Therefore, they submitted a public request to the Construction Department to change the location to south of Yong'an Gate, which would not hinder the dredging and would benefit the townspeople. Four representatives, including Xiang Jizong, came to the province to petition the Construction Department.</p>
<p>The Xixiang Protection Corps Plans to Jointly Attack Bandits. Yonggu Township in Zhenjiang County, located west of the county seat and bordering Gaozi, has been repeatedly affected by bandits. Recently, many bandits have been distributing notices and demanding donations in the Xidawei area of the township. Residents with some assets have been moving away. The district head Ding Tong has reported this to the county government, requesting that the Civil Affairs Department send a warship to be stationed at Longmenkou to defend against the bandits on the river. He also plans to jointly attack the bandits in the mountains with the First and Second District Protection Corps, making it impossible for them to find refuge.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The Salary Issue of Teachers and Staff Has Been Resolved. The teachers and staff in the county's urban and rural areas went to the Education Bureau to demand their salaries. This was because County Magistrate Wang had promised to pay them one and a half months' salary before the shops settled their accounts. However, due to heavy snowfall, officials were busy, and the funds collected by the Cao and Fen counters could not be transferred to the city. Consequently, it was difficult to fulfill the promise of one and a half months' salary. After the Director of Education and the Director of Finance Yang discussed the matter, one month's salary was paid first. The day before yesterday (the 16th), the teachers and staff went to the Education Bureau to demand the remaining half month's salary. As a result, Director Sun made every effort to find a way to pay 40% of it.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>A Kidnapping Case That Caused a Sensation Throughout the City. A Chen surname woman, 17 years old, living in Nan Shang Zhen Dian Lane in the city, had a romantic nature and was very social.

<p>All Printers of Newspapers Take a Break. The newspapers in this city decided in a meeting held in December last year, to promote the Gregorian calendar and abolish the Lunar calendar, that all newspapers would cease publication for seven days starting on January 2nd of this year. However, the newspapers were not allowed to stop publication during the Lunar New Year holiday. However, yesterday afternoon, all the printers requested a work stoppage and rest. The newspaper staff repeatedly persuaded them, but the workers were uncooperative. As a result, all newspapers in the city will cease publication for three days starting today. However, the printers of the Hu Bao newspaper wanted to extend the stoppage by two days because the New Hu Sheng Bao newspaper had stopped publication for nine days during the Gregorian New Year, in order to compensate for the shortage during the Gregorian New Year.</p>

<h3>Air Service Between Hankou and Yichang Will Be Realized</h3>
<p>▲The Company Has New Pilots</p>
<p>▲Traffic Will Be Available Within Two Weeks</p>
<p>According to the China National Aviation Corporation yesterday morning, the aviation affairs of the Hankou-Yichang section have not been opened due to the bad weather in Hankou, but they will be available within two weeks.

Although it has been raining and snowing in recent days, the company can still maintain 75% of its aviation operations. The company currently uses four aircraft. Except for one that is stranded in Hankou due to snow, the rest are flying normally. However, because the airfield in Hankou has a lot of snow, the aircraft arriving in Hankou are currently landing on the river.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Has Left Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Took a Steamer to Hong Kong on the 18th</p>
<p>The whereabouts of Mr. Huang Shaoxiong, the rehabilitation director of Guangxi, in Shanghai are very secret. His chief of staff, Lu Rusheng, and Gong Hanxian, the former Wuzhou garrison commander, took the Wilson President to Hong Kong and returned to Guangxi at 2 p.m. on the 18th. At that time, Mr. Huang and his wife actually took the same ship to Hong Kong. His relatives and friends did not know about it beforehand, so there was no one to see him off at the pier. Even Gong Hanxian and others did not know that he had changed his name and bought a ticket on the same ship until they met Huang on board. It is said that during Huang's stay in Shanghai, his old friends came to him one after another to seek employment and borrow money, which he could not cope with. Therefore, his whereabouts had to be kept strictly secret.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Is Scheduled to Return to Guangdong</h3>

<h3>Various Industry Tax Rules Associations Request Correction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Business Taxes Again</h3>
<p>▲Luxury Business is Different from Luxury Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Association of Industry Associations Tax Rules Research, again submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government in Nanjing yesterday, saying: In my humble opinion, whether the national tax rules are perfect or not has a direct relationship with the prosperity or decline of industry and commerce, and an indirect relationship with the prosperity or decline of the country. The reason why the members of the association have repeatedly reported on the business tax implemented in various provinces and cities is to promote the central government's good intentions in resolving the difficulties of Suzhou merchants, to seek the perfection of the tax system, and to benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. We have repeatedly received instructions, which are intended to ensure that the tax system considers both commercial difficulties and mutual consideration. They demonstrate consideration for the suffering of the people, which is deeply admired. Article 4 of the General Principles stipulates that the business tax rate should be calculated according to the taxable standard, using the per-mille method, and the levy should not exceed two per mille. However, this does not apply to luxury businesses and other businesses that contain a nature that should be banned. This is extremely clear. The government can use restrictions in the implementation of unified taxes and special taxes if the goods sold by the store are of a luxurious nature. However, those who do not primarily sell goods but engage in business for the entertainment of people's ears, eyes, bodies, and minds can be called luxury businesses. The business tax rates set by the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are largely exceeding the provisions of the Outline, which is due to the failure to fully understand the difference between luxury businesses and luxury goods, resulting in a slight error that leads to a thousand miles. This is why we have to explain this in a special telegram. We implore the Department to severely correct the examination of the business tax regulations of various provinces and cities to maintain commercial fairness and convenience. Shanghai Association of Industry Associations Tax Rules Research Committee.</p>
<h3>Wholesale Businesses Directly Set Up by Manufacturers Are Exempt from Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲Ministry of Finance Replies to the Silk and Satin Industry Association</p>
<p>The wholesale business tax of the Silk and Satin Industry Association is one-quarter of that of the retail business in Zhejiang, and half of that in Jiangsu, which seems lenient. However, the wholesale dealers in this industry are disguised wholesalers, which are purely entrusted management in nature, but in fact, they are directly set up by the manufacturer. The content is the same as the same family. The establishment of this dealer is only for the convenience of handling the conversion and shipment, which is easier to approach than another sale industry. It is like a pawnshop with a stepping stone. It is not a buying and selling act, nor is it for the purpose of profit. It should be exempt from business tax to avoid double taxation and to relieve commercial difficulties. After sending telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of Finance requesting an exemption, we received the reply from the Ministry of Finance Fu Zi No. 5675, which read: Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association, I have read the telegram. Article 1 of the General Principles of Business Tax in each province states that except for those who have been collected special consumption tax by the central government, if the silk factory and silk factory have been collected special tax by the central government, all manufacturing industries and the wholesale industries directly set up by them can be exempted from business tax. Wholesale and other sales industries in the goods sales industry should still be taxed to show the difference. In addition to the draft business tax regulations of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces being amended separately and consulted with the provincial government, the Financial Department should be notified to comply with it.</p>
<h3>Silk and Cocoon Industry Sends Telegram Requesting Tax Exemption</h3>
<p>▲Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>Shen Huachen, Chairman of the Shanghai Silk Factory Association Committee, submitted a letter to the National Government of Nanjing yesterday, which said: Appreciated by the National Government of Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, humbly maintaining international trade, exporting domestic production is the main purpose, so it is to enrich the national economy and thick people's livelihood. Although China is vast and rich in resources, the export of international trade is really behind the eastern and western countries. Silk, as an export item, is only one-seventh of Japan's in terms of export quantity, and it is already the largest export commodity in China, so it is of great importance to social finance, agriculture, industry, and people's livelihood. In recent years, the silk industry has been depressed and failing, and it has repeatedly faced bankruptcy. The reason for the cause is that the economy cannot be enriched, and the industry cannot progress. Those who operate silk factories have no huge capital and cannot take on a large amount of burden. It is not like Japanese silk merchants who have a national bank to back them up and the national treasury to help them. All silk and cocoon trade, domestic transshipment, and foreign exports are absolutely exempt from donations and taxes, and water and land transportation is strictly priced at low prices. Its maintenance and awards can be said to spare no effort, so it is not its enemy in terms of strength. Last year, the silk market declined, and almost all those who were in this industry went bankrupt. It was inevitable that we would appeal to the government to issue public bonds to seek salvation for the sake of one or two. The distant cause and near effect are all in the judgment of your court. Now, the government is building its first place, and it embodies the first premier's principle of people's livelihood, removing heavy donations and miscellaneous taxes, and defining long-term and good tax rules. It is a grand event that is rare in a thousand years, and it is also a time when tariffs are held by oneself. You can organize and import taxes to seek compensation. Businessmen and others consider the importance of international trade externally, and the crisis of business decline internally. If there is no consistency from top to bottom to reduce the burden, there will be no way to survive and seek development. On the fourth day of this month, the entire city's silk factory industry was convened to discuss the resolutions. I urge your court to exempt silk cocoons from taxation in general when determining new tax rules, so as to maintain international trade and save the decline of the Chinese silk industry.</p>

<h3>Another Inventor Passes Away</h3>
<p>▲British Inventor of Steam Turbine, Sir Charles Parsons, Passes</p>
<p>The news of the death of British inventor of the steam turbine (commonly known as the turbine engine), Sir Charles A. Parsons, reached Shanghai a few days ago.  The engineering community all express their regret.  Parsons was a great scientist and engineer, who was once as famous as Watt, Stephenson, and Kelvin.  The invention of this machine is only a few decades old, but it has become the source of power for the world, enabling mankind to enjoy comfort and convenience. Even today's massive ships rely on this machine to sail the oceans. Its prevalence is generally evident.</p>
<p>Parsons showed extraordinary talent in science and mechanics from a young age. While studying at Cambridge University in England (graduating in 1877), he created a model of an external combustion engine. This engine was superior to others because the cylinder could rotate around the crankshaft. At that time, this type of engine was adopted by the public. Therefore, Parsons became even more excited and devoted himself to the manufacturing of steam turbines. The first steam turbine was produced in 1884. The machine generated six horsepower. By 1889, a total of about three hundred steam turbine generators had been built, with a maximum output of up to seventy-five bottles. Subsequently, progress accelerated rapidly. By 1892, it was possible to build one hundred bottles. In 1900, it was possible to build one thousand bottles, and by 1907, a five thousand bottle unit could also be created. The application of steam turbines at sea began in 1897, which was the year when the now famous ship "Turbinia" set one of the fastest records during naval exercises. Two years later, the British Admiralty began to purchase Parsons' steam turbines. Foreign warships began to purchase them in 1903, starting with France. However, today, all warships in Britain and other countries are equipped with steam turbines created by Parsons, and power plants are equipped with up to 200,000 horsepower. Parsons, wishing to make the development of steam turbines widespread, granted permission for manufacturers in various countries to manufacture them shortly after their invention. Therefore, countries such as the United States, France, Germany, Japan, and Sweden took the opportunity to start manufacturing this machine. It is rare for an inventor to witness its amazing development, which was one of the most gratifying aspects of Parsons' life. The "Parsons" manufacturing plant established in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, was personally managed by Parsons until his death. Parsons had a very gentle nature. His hard work and success were achieved in silence. He did not have the eccentricities of those with extraordinary talents in the world. Those who interacted with him all respected and admired him. Having made a great contribution to the world, his passing today should leave a lasting memorial in the scientific and engineering communities.</p>
<h3>Protesting the Opium Monopoly - Continuing Efforts</h3>
<p>▲National Organizations Unite to Rise Up</p>
<p>▲Disguised Monopoly Also Not Approved</p>
<p>The Shanghai various circles protest against the opium monopoly joint meeting, the previous day decided on thirteen protest methods, has already been detailed in yesterday's newspaper.

The Zhejiang Provincial National Anti-Drug Association, already held a full executive committee the previous day, discussing detailed response measures, and will convene a conference of all Hangzhou groups or mass meeting within days, to hold a protest rally. Also, Tianjin and Provincial Capital, also telegraphed a report the previous day, to immediately hold a joint meeting of various public groups locally, vowing to use all their strength to protest against the public sale system, and the association has sent personnel to assist. It is reported that the local Christian church, expresses absolute sympathy for this protest against the opium monopoly, and now plans to dedicate a Sunday worship service to lecture on the opium issue, and unanimously advocate prohibition as the topic, and plans to hold a Christian protest against the opium monopoly, to express unified advocacy. In addition to actively contacting various national anti-drug groups and other public groups to oppose, the anti-drug association is also soliciting essays from academic circles against the opium monopoly, and requesting teachers from major and minor schools across the country to pay attention to the opium issue, and lecture students frequently, so that young students understand the cruelty of opium destroying the country and the people. The association is currently compiling a special book protesting against the opium monopoly, which will include the documents exchanged during this protest, the facts of the process, and the speeches of various celebrities during this period. It is also reported that the association not only disapproves of the public sale system from beginning to end, but also vows to protest to the end against disguised public sale.</p>

<h3>The China Philanthropic Association for Orphans Rescues the Orphans of Female Political Prisoners</h3>
<p>▲Liu Guizhen's Six-Month-Old Son</p>
<p>The China Philanthropic Association for Orphans, previously received a report from Dr. Fu Wenshou of the Red Cross General Hospital, stating that the hospital had the abandoned child of a female counter-revolutionary prisoner, Liu Guizhen, admitted for treatment and requesting verification and relief. The Association then sent Wang Guanyi, an officer from the Guarantee Department, to carry out the rescue. Unexpectedly, Ms. Liu had already been sent from the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and then from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Thereupon, Officer Wang drove to the Longhua Garrison Headquarters and met with Military Judge Chen of the Military Law Office. Military Judge Chen informed him that Ms. Liu did indeed have a son, only six months old, whose family originally lived in New Kangli, Yangshupu. The child had been admitted to the hospital for treatment before the case occurred. Therefore, her son is now in a state of abandonment. The length of the rescue depends on the length of the sentence. Officer Wang inquired about the penalty and sentence of the lady, and Military Judge Chen replied that a judgment had not yet been made and would be informed by letter after the verdict. The relief for the child must be temporary, as Ms. Liu will have the right to request his return after her sentence is served. It is said that the Association, considering the child's young age, cannot admit him to its own orphanage. Therefore, it has made other good plans to provide relief until his biological mother regains her freedom and the family is reunited.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Price Increase on the Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Line</h3>
<p>▲Reply from the Four Companies to the Seafood and Flour Trade Association</p>
<p>After the four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line announced an increase in passenger and freight fares, the Ningbo Seafood and Flour Trade Association sent a letter of opposition. Now, the company's reply is as follows: Respectfully, we received your letter discussing the matter of the Shanghai-Ningbo line's increase in passenger and freight fares. We respectfully acknowledge your guidance. However, times have changed, and in the past twenty years, the soaring prices of all goods and the extraordinary rise in gold prices are evident. The main supplies of the shipping companies, such as coal for the ships and all materials for repairs, are mostly foreign goods, and prices have doubled compared to last year. Secondly, in response to the request of the Seamen's Union, the company has appropriately increased the salaries of the sailors and stokers. Under these circumstances, the burden on our companies is already heavy. Moreover, due to the rampant piracy and the frequent occurrences of ship robberies, in order to learn from past mistakes and prevent future troubles, the establishment of escort teams cannot be delayed. Due to these three reasons, a significant amount of additional expenses has been incurred, making it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, after discussion by the four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, it was decided to appropriately increase passenger and freight fares to make up for the losses. We hope that you will understand the various difficulties involved.</p>
<h3>Measures by the Jianghai Customs to Facilitate Passenger Landing</h3>

<h3>Mediation of the Yong'an Second Factory Dispute is Successful</h3>
<p>The labor-management relations at the Wusong Yong'an Textile Second Factory were quite tense, leading to frequent labor disputes. The disputes that occurred last month regarding the uneven distribution of year-end bonuses and the dismissal of union leaders Jiang Ailin and Cai Hongmei have been resolved. The issue of year-end bonuses was mediated and signed by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 14th. The remaining issue of dismissing union leaders had been convened twice by the Bureau for mediation, but both sides insisted on their positions, resulting in no outcome. It should have been declared that the mediation had failed, but fearing that the dispute would be prolonged, causing complications and being detrimental to both labor and management, the third mediation committee was convened again yesterday morning at 10 a.m. to conduct mediation. The labor representative Jin Yaowen, the capital representative Chen Kuisheng, the chairman Wang Bing, and the recorder Wang Zhixin attended. After a long period of discussion, both sides agreed to sign two settlement agreements: (1) Employee Cai Hongmei will receive one demerit and will be allowed to resume her original work immediately. (2) Employee Jiang Ailin will be allowed to be dismissed by the factory. The chairman announced that the mediation was successful.</p>

<h3>Female Teacher's Case Against Foreman for Enticement to be Sentenced</h3>
<p>▲Ni Xiuzhen Invites Luo Cuiyu to Testify</p>
<p>▲Zhu Haisheng Denies Having a Child with Ni</p>
<p>▲The Sentence in this Case is Scheduled for the 27th</p>
<p>The female teacher Ni Xiuzhen sued the foreman of the Ruiyong Iron Factory, Zhu Haisheng, for the crime of enticement and abduction in the Special District Court. Subsequently, she lost the case and appealed to the High Court. The case has been heard three times, and all the details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing date arrived again, and witnesses were summoned to testify. At 4:30 p.m., Judge Song opened the first court to hear the case. Ni Xiuzhen and her mother, Ni Zhongshi, and Zhu Haisheng all arrived in court on time to await questioning. The hearing proceeded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Ni Xiuzhen  Judge Song first (asked) Ni Xiuzhen, "Has the witness Zhang Guangpei arrived?" Ni (replied), "Zhang and his wife have gone to Nanjing to work, so they are not here today. But Luo Baoshan's wife, who lives with me, is willing to testify in court. Mrs. Luo has arrived, please summon (her)."</p>
<p>▲Luo Cuiyu  The witness Luo Cuiyu was summoned to the witness stand and stated, "I live with Ni Xiuzhen at No. 9 Qingdao Road. The house is a three-story building with about three or four tenants. I live on the upper floor of the east wing, the landlord lives downstairs, and the upper floor of the living room is where Zhu Haisheng and Ni Xiuzhen lived." Judge Song (asked), "Did Ni Zhongshi often come?" (Answered), "She came when Xiuzhen's son had his one-month celebration." (Asked), "What day was the one-month celebration?" (Answered), "June 18th last year." (Asked), "When did you move out?" (Answered), "Roughly when the house was demolished, but I have forgotten the date." (Asked), "Do you know Ni Zhongshi?" (Answered), "I only met her at the one-month celebration. I had never seen her before."</p>
<p>▲Ni Zhongshi  Judge Song then summoned Ni Zhongshi (asked), "When did you move into No. 9 Qingdao Road?" (Answered), "August 3rd of the 19th year." (Asked), "Did your daughter rent the room before or after you?" (Answered), "Xiuzhen rented in April, I rented in August." (Asked), "How did you know about Ni Xiuzhen and Zhu Haisheng's affair?" (Answered), "In December of the 18th year, I saw that she was pregnant. After questioning her, I learned the truth. After learning about this, I wanted Zhu to marry her because what's done is done. However, Zhu's parents had to come forward for a formal marriage, because my husband used to work as a translator in the police station, and naturally, I did not want my daughter to be someone's mistress." (Asked), "Did you go to No. 9 when your grandson had his one-month celebration?" (Answered), "I never went."</p>
<p>▲Zhu Haisheng  Judge Song then summoned Zhu Haisheng (asked), "What exactly happened between you and Ni Xiuzhen from beginning to end?" (Answered), "After meeting Ni Xiuzhen upstairs in the Yong'an Company in February of the 16th year, I went to her house to play cards. At this time, she and Ni Zhongshi were already living on Qingdao Road. Ni Zhongshi knew about my affair with her daughter a long time ago. I stopped going there in the second half of the 18th year. The house at No. 9 Qingdao Road was not rented by me, and I do not know the witness either." (Asked), "You stopped going there in the 18th year, so why did Ni Xiuzhen have a child in the 19th year?" (Answered), "That is their nonsense. I did not have a child with her." (Asked), "How much money did you spend in total?" (Answered), "About a thousand yuan."</p>
<p>▲Sentencing Date  At this point, the lawyers for both sides, Qiu Fenling and Ye Fokang, argued vigorously. After the arguments, Judge Song announced that the debate in this case was concluded and that the sentence would be pronounced at 2:00 p.m. on the 27th. Zhu Haisheng was detained.</p>
<h3>Attempted Kidnapping Mistook Aunt</h3>
<p>▲What's Done is Done</p>
<p>Chen Fulan, a farmer near Ruizhi Bridge in Northwest Wusong, has two daughters, the elder named Aizhen, aged twenty, and the younger named Aiyun, aged seventeen. Both are beautiful and of similar height and build, almost identical. Both daughters had been betrothed since childhood. Aizhen was betrothed to a son of the Zhang family in Jiangwan, but she became a widow before marriage (commonly known as a widow of the door). Aiyun was betrothed to Zou Yuexiang, the son of Zou Wangshi, a neighboring farmer. Zou is twenty-one years old and comes from a very poor family, so he has no means to marry. Last year, Zou repeatedly asked a matchmaker to intercede with the Chen family, intending to marry hastily to start a family. However, the Chen family, due to the poverty of the Zou family, not only refused the request but also had intentions of breaking the engagement. Upon receiving this news, Zou Yuexiang was extremely distressed. Later, in September of last year, Zou, encouraged by friends and relatives, gathered many people and went to the Chen family to kidnap the bride. Because the Chen family had heard rumors beforehand, the whole family hid, so the incident did not succeed. Afterwards, the Chen family became strictly vigilant, and Zou Yuexiang gave up due to lack of ideas. Until 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Chen family had forgotten about the previous incident. As it was the Lunar New Year, Aizhen and Aiyun, dressed in new clothes, went out for a stroll. On the way, they happened to meet Zou Yuexiang. Seeing an opportunity, Zou immediately ran back home and gathered many friends and relatives to follow them and attempt a second kidnapping. Seeing the situation was bad, Chen Aizhen asked her sister to hide quickly. When Zou and the others arrived, they only saw Aizhen walking on the road. Because Aizhen looked very similar to Aiyun, Zou and the others, without distinguishing between right and wrong, kidnapped Aizhen to their home. Although Aizhen argued that she was not the one they wanted, the Zou family did not believe her and immediately forced Aizhen to worship the ancestors and get married with Yuexiang, and they shared the same bed. When Aiyun escaped home and told her father, Chen Lanfu, Chen did not think the Zou family would kidnap his elder daughter, so he dismissed it. It was not until late in the evening when Aizhen had not returned home that he knew something was wrong. He rushed to the Zou family, but it was already too late. Yesterday morning, Chen, along with the original matchmaker and many friends and relatives, went to the Zou family to negotiate. The two sides almost resorted to violence. Unexpectedly, something unexpected happened. Aizhen, having been mistakenly kidnapped by the Zou family, saw that Zou Yuexiang did not look too bad, so she told him that she was willing to serve him. When she saw her father coming to negotiate, she came out and begged her father to calm down and take a long-term view. Chen, as what's done is done, could only sigh helplessly. After mediation by relatives and friends of both sides, it was agreed that Aizhen would marry into the Zou family, Aiyun would be re-engaged to someone else, and the Zou family would pay fifty yuan and hold a banquet on a scheduled date to entertain the friends and relatives of both the Chen and Zou families, and kowtow to Chen Fulan in public to apologize, as a settlement.</p>
<h3>Change of Ownership of the 大陆报</h3>
<p>▲Four Chinese and Four Foreigners in the New Board of Directors</p>
<p>The 美大晚报 reported: "The local English 大陆报 was founded in 1911. Mr. Miller, currently serving as an advisor to the National Government, was the editor at the time. At that time, the newspaper was owned by Americans, and its reporters and staff were all American. After several years, it was purchased by Mr. Isla, the late owner of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. After Mr. Isla passed away, it was taken over by Isla's wife. Now, Mr. Dong Xianguang, representing merchants from Shanghai and North China, has purchased it. The price and the names of the new owners have not been released. Mr. Dong is currently the general manager of the newspaper. It was stated yesterday that the new board of directors consists of four Chinese and four foreigners. He is also one of the Chinese directors. The chairman of the board is Mr. Heckmond, a well-known American lawyer in Shanghai. The newspaper will continue to be a company registered in the United States. It is currently planning to hire news experts to make major improvements to increase the interest of readers. The newspaper's editorial department has moved to No. 36 Sichuan Road. The business department, currently located at No. 14.5 Jiujiang Road, will also be relocated soon. It is also heard that the new company will choose a site to build its own building."</p>
<h3>Modification Completed on First and Second City Ferries</h3>
<p>▲Inspected and Accepted Respectively on the Previous Two Days</p>
<p>The City Public Works Bureau built the No. 1 and No. 2 ferries in November of the 18th year and January of the 19th year respectively. Since their launch, a year has passed. According to customs regulations, repairs were necessary. The bureau, due to the completion of the No. 3 and No. 4 ferries in December of last year, which were capable of replacing the original ferries, submitted a request to the municipal government to have the No. 1 and No. 2 ferries repaired by the He Xing Machinery Manufacturing Factory and to expand the cabin space. Now that the work has been completed, the municipal government sent Counselor Xi Dingmo, together with Bureau Chief Huang, to inspect and accept the ferries at 2:00 PM on the 19th and 20th of this month, respectively. It is reported that the two ferries have been newly painted after the repairs. The middle layer, originally divided into special and first-class cabins, has now been entirely expanded into first-class cabins, with the special class cabins moved to the upper layer. Therefore, the capacity has increased, which is sufficient to meet the needs after the extension of the route to Gaoqiao. In addition, it is reported that the three cross-river ferries ordered by the bureau in August of last year were also inspected and accepted by Counselor Xi on the 13th of this month. The opening of the cross-river ferry service is not far off.</p>
<h3>Wife of Thief/Bandit Conceals Firearms</h3>
<p>▲Related to the Gunshot Wound of a Constable Case</p>
<p>Cao Zhixiu from Xuzhou, on the evening of the 27th of last month, specially invited Du Chengsong from Haizhou and others to his home to secretly discuss robbing a foreign goods store at No. 478 Huade Road. Cao's wife, Wang, was responsible for providing firearms. At 8:00 PM that night, Wang hid a handgun on her person and went to the store first, claiming to buy foreign cloth. The shop assistant, unaware of their scheme, was showing her the goods to choose from when Cao, Du, and other thieves swarmed into the store. Wang immediately took out the handgun and robbed the store, looting their fill and escaping. Afterwards, the shop owner, Chen Guoliang, filed a report with the Huishan Police Station, stating that the total value of the lost property was 338 yuan, and requested an investigation. Subsequently, detectives Shi Huanjing, Liu Baoshan, Zhao Rongsheng, and others arrested Cao, Wang, and another man, three in total. Under investigation, it was discovered that the case of the Tianyi Printing Company on Bei'er Road being broken into on August 20th last year at 11:00 AM, although the robbery was unsuccessful, and the gatekeeper constable, Lu Huaxing, was shot in the foot by the thieves, was also committed by Cao and others. The constable was summoned to the police station to identify the suspects. According to him, Cao was indeed present at the scene, holding a handgun and firing three shots, resulting in the constable being wounded in the foot. Based on his testimony, the police station added a charge of attempted robbery and a charge of shooting and wounding the constable against Cao Zhixiu. Yesterday morning, the colleagues were summoned to bring the three men and women to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng interrogated them. The constable suddenly identified Du Chengsong as one of the thieves present at the scene. When questioned, both Cao and Du confessed to the Huade Road case. However, their statements regarding the Tianyi Printing Company robbery attempt and the shooting of the constable were ambiguous. Cao's wife, Wang, also stubbornly denied everything, claiming that Du's statement that she carried the handgun as a pretext to buy cloth at the store was false. After Judge Feng finished recording the statements, he ordered the defendants to be detained separately, awaiting sentencing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Two Thieves Heavily Sentenced in Two Concessions</h3>
<p>The two bandits, Zhou Agou and Qian Zhengxiang, colluded with a gang to rob the old clerk of Baoda Xiang Foreign Goods Store on Tongyun Street outside the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession on September 13th of last year, stealing several thousand silver dollars, resisted arrest with gunfire, and fled with the loot. The victim reported the case to the police station and requested their arrest. Now, Zhou and Qian have committed crimes in the British Concession and were recently arrested. They were sent to the Special District Court, where Zhou was sentenced to 11 years and Qian to 16 years. Now, detective Zeng Jiuru and Bao detective Liu Jinrong of the French Police Station have learned of this and went to retrieve Zhou and Qian from the British Concession. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Court for questioning. The plaintiff first recounted the previous incident. Zhou and Qian confessed to the robbery. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Zhou and Qian to five years in the Western prison each, followed by deportation and transfer to the inland authorities for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Seducing and Raping a Neighbor's Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>▲Chen Huihong Cannot Deny the Charges</p>
<p>Liu Longgen, the 16-year-old adopted daughter of Teng Kaifu, a Yangzhou native residing at No. 77 Nanxing Road, Datong Road, Zhabei, disappeared while playing at the door at 6:30 PM on the 18th of this month. Teng immediately asked relatives and friends to search for her and investigated various hotels. Until 7:20 AM the next morning (the 19th), while passing the entrance of the Aiwen Hotel at No. 1892 Aiwenyi Road in the Public Concession, he saw Chen Huihong (age 20), a native of Yuyao, walking out of the hotel. Chen also lived on Nanxing Road, opposite Teng's residence, and they had seen each other before. Suspecting Chen of being involved in the adopted daughter's disappearance, Teng immediately grabbed him. Chen admitted that Liu Longgen had indeed stayed overnight with him in the hotel and led Teng to room 39, where they found Longgen getting out of bed. They immediately called constable No. 177 and Chinese detective Weng Peiyu, who arrested Chen and took him to the Xin Zha Police Station. The girl was sent to the hospital, where it was confirmed that she had been raped. Yesterday morning, Chen was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, presented the case, stating that the police station was prosecuting Chen for the crime of raping a girl under the age of sixteen under Article 240, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, and requested punishment. The examination report was also submitted for review. Teng Kaifu stated that although his adopted daughter was sixteen years old, she was born on December 12th and was therefore only fifteen years old. She was not yet married to his son. He also recounted the circumstances of her disappearance. The girl, Liu Longgen, also testified that she was sixteen years old and had been adopted into the Teng family at the age of twelve, but was not yet married. She had been working in a silk factory and had known the defendant since June of last year. Chen invited her to see a movie at the Zhabei Grand Theater at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. Before the movie was over, Chen lured her to the Aiwen Hotel. Upon arriving at the entrance, they met Wu Shizhen and entered room 39 together. Soon after, Chen took a cotton robe to the pawnshop. Wu was watching her while Chen pawned the robe for eight yuan, and then Wu left. Around 8:00 PM, she was forcibly raped by Chen. She was only found by her father the next morning, and so on. The defendant claimed that he lived in the cigarette paper shop opposite the plaintiff's residence and that he had known Liu since she came to buy things, which had been about ten months. They had gone to the movies several times together. The day before yesterday, Liu went to the Zhabei Grand Theater to see a movie with a young girl and Wu Shizhen. At that time, Liu claimed that she did not want to go home, so she stayed with him. After Judge Ge Zhitan examined the testimony, he ordered a court attendant to take Liu to the forensic medical office for another examination. It was determined that Liu's hymen was newly broken. The court then appointed Wang Weizhen as the defendant's lawyer and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, awaiting sentencing on the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Car Collision Kills a Woman</h3>
<p>Kong, the wife of Zhang Yangao from Suzhou, was walking from east to west on Aidaoya Road at 10:30 PM on the 6th of this month when she turned onto Songshan Road. A car with license plate number 7194 was speeding towards her, and they could not avoid each other. Kong was knocked down and seriously injured. Patrol officers took the injured woman to Renji Hospital for treatment and identified her husband, who lived at No. 591 Zhaojia Road, Ximen, and notified Zhang Yangao to go to the hospital. The driver, Chen Xingsheng, was summoned to the police station for questioning and ordered to wait for instructions. However, Kong's injuries were critical, and she died in the hospital the day before yesterday. Her body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the husband and the driver were summoned. The Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Guo to inspect the body. According to Chen Xingsheng, the deceased was crossing the road at the time and was not careful, which was not due to his negligent driving. Zhang Yangao, the husband, requested that the examination be waived so that he could prepare the coffin. Prosecutor Guo approved the request, ordered Zhang to sign a guarantee, and allowed him to claim the body.</p>
<h3>New Regulations for Issuing Passports for Going Abroad</h3>
<p>▲Implemented Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's consultation, stated that overseas Chinese merchants had repeatedly complained that the fees for Chinese passports for going abroad and passports for passing through territories were too high and the validity period was too short. They requested that new regulations be revised to benefit overseas Chinese. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that for passports for passing through territories, such as going to Yunnan, which required passing through Vietnam, and Xinjiang, which required passing through the Siberian Railway, these passports belonged to domestic travel and should be charged half the fee. This had been consulted by the Shanghai Municipal Government and informed the Municipal Public Security Bureau to comply. Now, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reduced the fees for Chinese passports for going abroad and extended the validity period. The new regulations have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal and County Governments regarding the approved new regulations, and instructed the passport-issuing authorities to comply with them. It is reported that after receiving the order, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately rushed to print the new regulations and sent them to various public groups. Starting yesterday (the 20th), the new regulations and the new passports issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been implemented.</p>

<p>▲Will Not Err Himself or Mislead the Country</p>
<p>Wu Peifu is living in Sichuan. As the outside world is paying close attention to his actions, Wu recently sent a telegram to his friends in Shanghai. The original telegram stated briefly, "Since I have retreated to Sichuan, I am purely in a civilian capacity, responding to peace, and do not carry any political odor. How can there be military actions to err myself or mislead the country? Moreover, the generals in Sichuan will never be so foolish. When Feng's forces were in Shaanxi and Gansu, there were already autonomous bandit suppression titles. Please do not lightly believe the rumors." Wu's recent situation can be seen in this way.</p>

<h3>Financial Bar Gold Report Rebounds and Soars</h3>
<p>Rebounded by Twelve Taels and Eight Mace</p>
<p>Difference of Twenty Taels and Five Cash</p>
<p>▲Conflicting News Leads to Great Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday, February 20th, the price of bar gold rebounded again, and 780 taels had been sent to Guanwai. However, the market situation was bizarre and volatile, and sudden rises and falls of several taels were not uncommon. Although the surging waves were difficult to suppress, the front and rear markets had a total difference of 20 taels. As for foreign exchange, it rebounded by one level, but the internal situation was different, and in the end, the price was tightly raised. The buying and selling in the market were different, and the psychology of each firm was quite uncertain.</p>
<p>Firms such as Yuansheng, Zhifengyong, Hengxingyuan, and Yu Da generally bought in, while Qianchangxiang, Changshengyong, Yuantai, and Hongli advanced and then exited. Hengxing continued to sell off. The overseas silver market rose, and because of the news that Citibank had rescued the silver market, the price of gold opened lower. Afterwards, the buyers showed strong interest, especially because the Sino-US loan may not be successful, which boosted people's confidence and caused the price to soar. After a rise of more than ten taels, Hengxing and Qianchangxiang sold off, because it was rumored that there was a need for cash abroad, which caused the price to plummet. At times, there were plateaus of six or seven taels. At noon, the exchange rate eased, and the sellers on the counter were agile and showed signs of fatigue, falling sharply by more than ten taels to within 75 taels. The after-hours market rebounded to more than 80 taels as Fuchang and Xinheng bought in, but the fluctuations were small, with a review of ten taels. The final price was 83 or 84 taels. The spot market seemed to be active, so the red strip increased by one tael. It is said that the big bar price tended to fall this morning.</p>
<p>▲Big Bar Report Opened Lower</p>
<p>The April opening price in the morning fell by three and a half taels to 767 and a half taels. The big bar price was indeed up 3/16, the silver price was up 5/8, and the private telegram was also up 9/16. Afterwards, Fuchang and Fuyu bought in, and because the US-China loan was still difficult to approach, people's confidence went up and soared. The price soared by more than 13 taels when the shilling opened, reaching 81 taels. The posted price was up 25, the US dollar was up half a yuan, and the Japanese gold was down a small 3/25 and was not moved. However, the internal stability was firm, and Maihang offered May British gold at 1 shilling and 2 pence, which was then bought by HSBC at the same price in April. In addition, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Hengxingyuan, and others sold and bought, so the price increased by more than four taels. At 9:30, it was 85 and a half taels. Afterwards, Yuan Maoyong and Hengxing sold off, and it was rumored that there was a need for silver abroad, which lowered people's confidence. The price fell more than seven taels to 78 taels at a little after 10:10. Shortly after, buyers did not slack off, and Yuancheng, Yongheng, and Yuanheng chased in. In addition, Sumitomo and Taiwan bought May British gold at 2 pence, and the hedging firms then put in slips, so the price rose again by six or seven taels, but there were fluctuations of two or three taels at a time, reaching 85 taels at 11:10. Afterwards, Hongli, Changshengyong, Qianchangxiang, and others sold off again. The supply on the counter exceeded demand, making it difficult for the market price to stand firm. In the violent storm, the price fell miserably by twelve taels. The British gold can be settled at 1.20625. By the close of the market, it was 73 taels due to the arrival of goods, so the closing price was 76 and a half taels. The price was repeatedly raised to 80 taels, and the asking price was changed to 847 taels and 8 mace, down about 70 taels.</p>
<p>▲Bank's Cash Purchase Jumps Seven Taels</p>
<p>The after-hours market opened at 78 and a half taels, then fell from 82 taels to 80 taels and 5 cash, which was due to the uncertainty of people's confidence and the difference in buying and selling. Afterwards, Yuanheng and Fuchang and others competed to buy, because it was rumored that a certain bank wanted to buy spot goods to prepare for export. Almost all firms' sentiments rose sharply, jumping more than seven taels to 88 taels at a little after 2:20. The exchange market was also firm. Shanghai offered May British gold at 1.19375. Afterwards, Wupin, Yuan Maoyong, and Lixinyong all sold off, so the price showed signs of fatigue, falling seven or eight taels, but there was a rebound of more than three taels. Until 3:30, it fell back to 80 taels and 5 cash. Afterwards, Zhifengyong and retail traders bought in, and there were also many who covered short positions. In addition, the bank bought April and May British gold at 2 pence to 1.9375 pence, so the price reversed and increased by five taels, reaching 85 and a half taels at 4:00. In a moment, more than two taels were cut off, to 83 taels. The closing price at 4:30 was 83 taels and 8, a rebound of twelve taels and eight mace compared to the day before, and then increased by six or seven cash to 84 taels. The highest price of the day was 88 taels, and the lowest price was 67 and a half taels, a difference of 20 taels and 5 cash. The early market price of Wupin was 68 taels, the noon closing price was 80 taels, the afternoon price was 80 taels, and the closing price was 84 taels and 5 cash. The settlement price was 70 taels to 60 taels, and the closing price was 63 or 64 taels. The double prices of the front and rear market accounts were 67 taels for February and 70 taels for March in the morning, and 73 taels for February in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲Different Trading Psychologies of Firms</p>
<p>Regarding the transactions of each firm, Zhifengyong, Yuancheng, Shunli, Yongheng, and Hengxingyuan all bought in. Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, Changshengyong, and Hongli bought in first and then exited. Yu Da bought in. Yuantai, Futaiheng, Beikang, Yongfeng, and Dadecheng had tight buying and selling. Hengxing and Yuanchengyong and Tongtaichang all exited. In the afternoon, Yuan Maoyong, Lixinyong, and Tongtaichang all exited. Changshengyong, Fuchang, and Yuanheng bought in. Zhifengyong, Yu Da, Dadecheng, Futaiheng, Zhenchangxiang, Yu Da, and Wanxing sold off at times. The Dalian gang had a total of more than 2,000 bars, and the buying and selling balanced. The Guangdong gang sold 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3>The Fluctuations of Foreign Exchange Suggests a Superficial Ease but Underlying Tightness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver markets in England, America, and India all reported rises, while the European market remained flat with buyers inactive. The exchange rate between England and America tended to decline. There was no significant change in Yokohama and Kobe. As for the Shanghai market, the HSBC exchange rate quotation was extended by one increment, with British gold at 25, now at 1 shilling, 1 penny, and 875/1000. American gold was half a yuan, calculated at 28 yuan. Indian exchange was 1.5 yuan, calculated at 78 rupees. French francs were 13 yuan, calculated at 716 yuan. German exchange was 2 yuan, calculated at 118 marks. Dutch silver dollars were 1.25 yuan, calculated at 70. Singapore exchange decreased by 3.75 taels, calculated at 200 taels. Hong Kong remained at 78.5 taels. The Japanese exchange decreased by 0.325, calculated at 1 tael, 7 qian, and 6 fen. However, the internal market shifted from loose to firm, then weakened at noon, and stabilized in the afternoon. Because the gold market was still volatile, with fluctuations of up to 20 taels throughout the day, the exchange market was also hesitant, ultimately trending towards tightness. Compared to the previous day, British gold decreased by 0.1875, American gold by 0.0375, and Japanese gold increased by 0.0175. This truly suggests a superficial ease but underlying tightness, the opposite of the day before yesterday. There were conflicting reports among Chinese gold firms. British gold transactions amounted to over 200,000 pounds, with firms like Yu Fa Xiang engaging in buying activities, while Fu Chang, Run Chang, and Yu, among others, sold. On the banking side, Shanghai firms like Oltramare &amp; Co. generally sold positions, while Mitsui, HSBC, Sumitomo, Taiwan Bank, and others absorbed. In addition, various banks traded tens of thousands of pounds among themselves. Transactions in both the American and Japanese exchange markets were limited, and the overall market atmosphere was unsettling. This was indeed due to the variety of conflicting news, causing people to be hesitant and uncertain.</p>
<h3>The United States Considering Maintaining the Price of Silver</h3>
<p>▲ London and New York Continue to See Increases</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to a large London dispatch, the price of silver continued to rise in both London and New York. The near-term price increased by 0.01875 to 12 pence and 0.4375 (equivalent to 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 0.0625 in British gold), while the forward price also increased by 0.01875 to 12 pence and 0.3125. Mainland China and India were both buying, and the market was generally flat. After the market closed, the situation felt even more stable. It is said that the United States is making great efforts to maintain the silver market. According to a New York dispatch, the price of American silver increased by 0.0625, with spot prices at 27 cents. The exchange rate between England and America decreased by 0.03125 to $4.8565625. The exchange rate between America and England remained unchanged at $4.856875. The exchange rate between Japan and America remained at $0.494375, and the exchange rate between England and Japan remained at $0.494375.

Furthermore, there were no changes in the Reuters and Domei Tsushin dispatches that morning.</p>
<h3>No Major Changes in the Silver and Copper Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, silver dollars were better by 0.0025 yuan compared to the previous day, at 0.07225 yuan. The afternoon market remained closed.

Guangdong small dollars were 0.06635 yuan, with 125,000 jiao traded. Copper coins increased by another 5,000 wen, to 379,000 wen.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Traded 3.7 Million</h3>
<p>▲ Prices Continue to Rise Slightly, but the Trend Is Increasingly Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai securities market, spot prices for various bonds and futures were offered in the morning. Only 19 cigarettes and 19 charity bonds were offered for a few thousand yuan, and there were no other transactions. The futures market was also quiet, and the atmosphere among buyers and sellers was calm. Total transactions between the two sessions amounted to approximately 3.7 million yuan, including approximately 700,000 yuan each for demobilization, 19 charity bonds, and 20-year cigarette bonds, and an average of 500,000 yuan for 19 customs consolidation bonds. The situation in other markets was very quiet, and the supply and demand situation in the market was extremely balanced. Therefore, prices fluctuated very steadily, and the quiet situation was no different from before. For example, the futures price of 20-year cigarette bonds and the spot prices of 19 customs consolidation bonds and 19 charity bonds each continued to rise by half a yuan. The February 7th futures price continued to rise by 1.8 yuan compared to the first ten days of the month, and other prices were also generally slightly firmer. There were no transactions in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Rise in the Yarn Market Is Alarming</h3>
<p>▲ Strong Holding by Both Sides, Jumping 5 Taels Extra</p>
<p>▲ Special Deposit of 50 Taels Added for Each New Purchase</p>
<p>The yarn market is very strong, and the intensity of the rise is rarely seen. It is mainly because the exchange rate is difficult to loosen, and the overseas cotton yarn market is trending upward, which further affects the local market. In addition, due to the settlement period, the market was closed for five days. During these days, American cotton remained flat, while Indian cotton rose sharply. As a result, people became more enthusiastic. Today, only buying voices were heard in the market, and sellers disappeared. The price for April was called out at 190 taels, but there was a lack of sellers. As a result, the situation was extremely tense. The two sides held each other for several hours without reaching a deal. Only February was traded at 175.8 taels, and March at 177 taels. The rest were blank boards. Although the authorities tried to maintain the situation in the afternoon, the first board barely passed. Each month rose by 5 taels, but the atmosphere was extremely bad, and cotton was difficult to trade. In the second yarn market, the two sides held each other, and the matter could not be resolved until after 6 o'clock. Due to time constraints, the details are unknown. It is heard that a special cash deposit of 50 taels will be added for each new purchase. The opening prices in the afternoon are listed on the left: Marks Rise/Fall Inventory Account</p>
<p>21758　Up 50　19,750　51796　Up 51　41,650</p>
<p>31777　Up 50　39,600　61794　Up 50　36,800</p>
<p>41784　Up 50　49,610　71795　Up 50　150</p>
<p>Current Yarn Sales Slightly Active. It is found that the statistics of purchases by various gangs throughout the day are about 1,000 bales, of which 870 bales are from colleagues. The market price has risen by 8, 9 taels. Among the customer gangs, 220 bales were imported from Guangdong, 150 bales from Tianjin, 30 bales from Nanyang, 240 bales from the mainland, 40 bales from Ningbo, 50 bales from Xuzhou, 45 bales from Fuzhou, 40 bales from Qindao, 40 bales from Jiangxi, and 100 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Is Extremely Sharp</h3>
<p>▲ Bidding Opens in February's Session</p>
<p>▲ New Purchases Require an Increased Deposit of 20 Taels</p>
<p>The rising momentum of the cotton market is extremely sharp, which has not been seen in recent times. This is because Indian cotton is trending upward, the political situation in India is good, the market price is rising, and the gold price is soaring. Outside of foreign exchange, all reporters are hoarding and not selling. Therefore, when the cotton futures market opened today, sellers were completely absent from the market, but the buying interest was extremely strong. Because the rising momentum is too rapid, the sellers are panicking. The future situation of the cotton market is difficult to predict. The two sides in the cotton futures market held each other for several hours without reaching an agreement. No deals were made in the morning session. In the afternoon, after 6 o'clock, one lot was auctioned off for February at 45 taels. The rest were blank boards. It is heard that each new purchase requires an increase in the deposit of 20 taels. The February price is recorded below:</p>
<p>Han Mark　Closing Price　Rise/Fall　Inventory Account</p>
<p>February　45.00　Up 1.70　40,600　May　…　108,400</p>
<p>March　…　88,400　June　…　81,600</p>
<p>April　…　82,400　July　…　38,000</p>
<p>Although various factories have made arrangements for current cotton, sellers are hoarding and not selling. There is no source of supply. American cotton: 52.00. Yufeng imported 100 pieces to the factory.</p>
<h3>Sudden Fall in Foreign Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>▲American Cotton Reverses and Falls</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm at first due to purchases by colleagues, but then it became weak due to selling and profit-taking. Futures fell by 2 to 5 points, and spot fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 to 4 points, and spot rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 25 points. The Indian cotton market was uncertain and slightly weaker due to profit-taking. Pingle and Bairao Creek near and far terms fell by 1 rupee. Omra near and far terms remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (19th telegram).</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Instructions on How Overseas Chinese Students Return to China for Further Education</h3>
<p>According to the National Tsinghua University's request for instructions on how overseas Chinese students should return to China for further education, the Ministry of Education approved the Philippine Chinese High School's letter stating that, in order to adapt to the environment, the local schools' academic years are consistent with those of Philippine schools (7 years for primary school and 4 years for secondary school). Upon secondary school graduation, many students plan to return to China for further education at universities. Please send your school's charter and provide instructions on admission procedures. In the future, when taking the entrance examination for your school, what level will they be allowed to take? Are there any preferential policies for overseas Chinese students returning to China? Please provide detailed information. Accordingly, regarding what measures should be taken for overseas Chinese students to return to China for further education after graduating from schools in their current location, our school has no regulations or systems to follow. In light of the school's inquiry, we have requested instructions. The Ministry of Education instructed: "We have received the report. The Overseas Chinese Education Conference convened by the Central Training Department resolved that for national and provincial schools with overseas Chinese children returning to China to study, those who are certified by overseas Chinese organizations as being poor may be granted tuition waivers by the schools based on their circumstances. Overseas Chinese students who are not admitted to the domestic schools they apply to should be directly introduced by the schools to schools of equivalent academic level or attend remedial classes in schools with overseas Chinese remedial classes, or the schools should provide opportunities for remedial classes on their own. This principle should be followed until specific regulations are established for overseas Chinese students returning to China to study. We hereby order you to be informed."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Approves Correction of Old Phonetic Dictionaries</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the report of Tang Yuezhen, professor of National Wuhan University, Hubei Province, approved the correction of old national phonetic dictionaries (since the National Government has promulgated the new phonetic notation, it seems inappropriate to allow the old national phonetic dictionaries to continue to be sold on the market, which is useless to book buyers and harmful to the future of phonetic notation. It is hoped that measures will be taken to require bookstores that publish this type of old national phonetic dictionary to first correct the old national phonetics in an appropriate manner, and then allow them to be sold freely, otherwise they should be strictly prohibited). The Ministry of Education instructed: "We have received the report. The professor's request is feasible. After the new national phonetic commonly used character collection compiled by the Ministry's National Language Unification Preparation Committee is completed and submitted to the Ministry for promulgation, we will immediately order the bookstores to correct the phonetic notations in the old national phonetic dictionaries, etc., in accordance with the new system, in order to unify them and avoid errors. Please inform them accordingly."</p>

<h3>Montessori Education Method</h3>
<p>▲ Not Applicable to China</p>
<p>丨The Ministry of Education Requests the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Convey Montessori's Message丨</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to the report of the Italian Embassy, stated that Dr. Montessori sent a book on the Montessori Education Method and five copies of the regulations of the Montessori Education Method Training Institute, as well as a letter to Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Education, requesting that it be forwarded and stating that if there are reports and documents from schools in your country that use the Montessori Education Method, please request the Ministry of Education to send one or two copies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs forwarded the regulations of the Montessori Education Method Training Institute and Montessori's letter to Minister Jiang to the Ministry of Education for review and reply. The Ministry of Education replied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the day before yesterday, attaching a translated copy of Montessori's article and requesting that it be forwarded to Montessori. The main idea of the original letter was: "We previously received Dr. Montessori's letter requesting that personnel be sent to Rome to learn her education method, and we replied and promised to send a Chinese translation of the Montessori Education Method at any time. It has been found that schools in our country have been experimenting with this education method for ten years. At that time, in order to strive to suit the educational principles, Montessori teaching aids were also produced and used. However, according to those who have actually experimented, this method requires too many teaching aids, and each child needs teaching aids worth about 50 yuan, which seems uneconomical and difficult to promote in China. Recently, kindergartens and lower grades of primary schools in various places in China generally use project-based teaching methods, using the living environment and daily sights and sounds as teaching materials, and do not pay much attention to the use of more mechanical special teaching aids. Therefore, for this education method, we only learn its spirit and have no specific experiments to report." In addition to including a book on Montessori and her education, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is requested to forward it to show the Chinese translation of the education method.</p>

The results were: (1) Youth won against Team 33, 38 to 15; (2) Lively won against Tu Jin, 15 to 14; (3) Mei Gong won against Huadong, 42 to 30.</p>
<p>▲ Youth Won Against 33 (Group B1) - The Youth team has outstanding talents, is well-trained, and their movements are clean and graceful. Team 33 was also a strong team, but in comparison, they were far inferior to the Youth team. When the Youth team scored twenty points, Team 33 just started recording. The first half was 22 to 5. Starting in the second half, Team 33 tried to retaliate and made many achievements, making the situation slightly peaceful. As a result, Qing Guang scored 38 points, and Team 33 scored 15 points.</p>
<p>▲ Lively Won Against Tu Jin (Group B2) - The two teams were evenly matched, and the situation was balanced. The score in the first half was 9 to 4, with Lively taking the lead. In the second half, Tu Jin launched a fierce counterattack, and the situation was very tense. Tu Jin once took the lead with 14 to 13, but in the end, Lively won by one point with a score of 15 to 14, which was also very dangerous.</p>
<p>▲ Mei Gong Won Against Huadong (Group A) - Mei Gong's strength is very strong, even better than the West Youth Sea [blank]. They have the greatest hope for the championship of this Shanghai Association. Although Huadong was also famous for a while, they were ultimately not their opponents. In the battle, Ouyang of Huadong scored the first point. From then on, Mei School's momentum was great, and their charge was unstoppable. The performance of Shiguya and Pilei was praised by the audience. Although Huadong also had a good performance, it was difficult to surpass the former, and their defense was overwhelmed. In the first half, Mei Gong scored 21 points, and Huadong scored 8 points. Starting in the second half, the situation was as before. Later, Mei Gong's lineup was adjusted from time to time, and their strength was slightly weaker. Huadong took the opportunity to counterattack, and the momentum was great. They even scored ten points in a row. As a result, Mei Gong won by 42 to 30. Although Huadong lost, their performance was also very good. It was fate, not a sin of war. The referee was Xu Zhendong.</p>

<h3>City No. 1 Stadium Moves into New Building to Work</h3>
<p>The original buildings of the Municipal First Public Stadium were all required to be used by the Municipal Education Bureau, and funds were allocated for the stadium to build new offices and other rooms at the southern end. Construction began three months ago and has now been completed. It is reported that the staff of the stadium moved into the new building yesterday to work. This Saturday and Sunday, all football teams must sign in and negotiate for the Industrial and Commercial Football Competition inside the new building. From Monday, February 23rd, all people who come to the stadium must enter and exit through the main gate of the stadium on Dalin Road.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>[P Talks About Liu San Xia Fei</p>
<p>Su Manshu sent Liu San a poem from Baimen: "Thank you Liu San for asking about my news, I still have a faint life to be a poetry monk." Also, a verse about hearing the sound of cuckoos at night in Taoguang Temple, West Lake, sent to Liu San: "Liu San was a passionate seed in the past, wandering in the misty waves for another year." Manshu also made Baimen Autumn Willow Picture, Wenji Picture, and Huangye Tower Picture for Liu San. The friendship between Liu San and Manshu, and Liu San's romantic and unrestrained life, can be seen from this. Liu San, originally named Ji Ping, was from Shanghai, with the pseudonym Jiangnan, and also signed as Jiangnan Liu San. During the Guangxu and Xuantong years, he studied at Chengcheng School of the Army Cavalry Department in Tokyo. He was good at poetry and calligraphy, especially proficient in Han Li. He studied and imitated for more than 30 years, benefiting from Shimen Song. He once lectured at Peking University and jointly revised the example of selling books with Shen Yinmo. For a time, he was famous in the north and south. People scrambled to treasure every inch of his work.</p>
<p>During the Su Bao case, Zhang Taiyan and Zou Rong were detained in prison. Zou Rong died of illness in prison. Lu Yan Changchi dared not ask about it. Liu San calmly and unhurriedly collected the body and buried it next to the Huangye Tower in his hometown of Hua Jing Township. His chivalrous and righteous deeds shone brightly for thousands of years. In the 11th year of the Republic of China, Yu Youren, Zhang Taiyan, Li Yinquan, Zhang Puquan, Zhang Shizhao, and others personally offered sacrifices and erected a monument in his memory. Taiyan wrote the inscription calling him a righteous man, taking the allusion from Gong Ding'an's poem "Liu San is now a righteous man."</p>
<p>Liu has an addiction to things in the cup. His drinking capacity is no less than that of his predecessor Liu Ling. Because it was difficult to find good wine on the market, he made his own. He had to drink at every meal. When he drank to a high level of excitement, he sang loudly. His wife, Lu Lingsu, was knowledgeable and courteous, and especially proficient in Kunqu opera. The husband and wife sang and followed each other, enjoying the ultimate happiness in the world. Liu once gambled with a painter and drank as a game. After the meal, the servant said that today we drank more than 60 catties of wine together. His drinking capacity can be imagined.</p>
<p>His poetic chanting is also very readable. I will record a few chapters to summarize the rest. Remember two poems: "Remember the bright ferry bridge in spring, dressed in crimson to block the road and ask about the morning. For no reason, I took leave to go to Jiangnan, reducing the beauty by an inch of waist." "The orioles fly in disorder in Jiangnan in March. I cut off the Wusong and returned again. I bought a pair of dragon flowers, and the peach blossoms hit my spring clothes like snow." Giving to Lingsu: "The waters of Wan and Xiang are endless, and his tracks are also vertical and horizontal. How can he not finish his soaring intention, and want to travel ten thousand miles to Huanglong." "It is not possible to listen to the absurdities of women. He should look at the old Liu Ling in the mountains and rivers. A drunk man wrongly passed on his family law and willingly served as a makeup table to sue for drunkenness and awakening." Sending Manshu to India: "He indulged in Zen in his early years and saw the truth of nature. The old house in the rivers and mountains is lonely and sad. He suddenly made a plan to go south with the scriptures on his shoulders. The white horse is the second person to invest in the wilderness." All are brilliant verses.</p>

<h3>Interesting Interpretation of Idioms · Bing · Xiu</h3>
<p>There is a Liang family boy next door, who is erudite, ingenious, and good at eloquence. He once said that many sentences in the "Story Qionglin" book are appropriate for the current situation. For example, "Jingwei carrying stones is compared to people's futile efforts," which refers to Wang Jingwei holding a grudge against Chiang Kai-shek, and comparing the failure of the enlarged meeting to his futile efforts. Also, "Stones from other mountains can be used to attack jade," which refers to Chiang Kai-shek, who forced Yan Xishan to go elsewhere, and can also be used to attack and retreat Feng Yuxiang. Ingenious words and soothing mood, or also the same class as the Eastern Chun Yu. (Que Chou)</p>

<h3>Ode to the Snow Elephant Pu</h3>
<p>It has been snowing continuously for days and has not cleared. The amount of snow is unprecedented in the past 30 years. The light cold makes people feel shivering and pitiful, but those who are drinking happily around the stove and sleeping comfortably under the quilt often take this as a joke. A few days ago, my friend Mr. Gu Xuchu built a Buddha statue, like a Bodhisattva lowering his eyebrows, hollow in the middle, with an electric lamp running through it, supported by a table, about three feet high. In the evening, the background was entrusted to a black curtain, and photographer Wang Kai next to the County Temple was called to make several photos, which were distributed to like-minded people, which was also a refined and leisurely interest. And my neighbor has built a beautiful woman statue with accumulated snow, which is especially a charm of boudoir people. I have already appreciated it, and there must be words. Therefore, I write a few words below.</p>
<p>▲ Snow Maitreya Flying tin came to visit, the earth returned to spring, thousands of worlds, carved jade and piled silver. Awakening infatuated dreams, washing away the mundane world. Occasionally showing the color phase, changing the shape and separating the body. Cold is not poor, the chest has an ice heart. Opening the face to preach the Dharma, the result comes from the cause. The setting sun shines westward, and the rise and fall exceed the beauty. The empty mountain and flowing water begin to return to the truth.</p>
<p>▲ Snow Beauty Qionglou Yexiao, Qiong girl makes incense, Gu She's graceful appearance, plain and white dress. Talented Yongxu, ice and snow heart. The life experience of flying flowers is still sad. Yu Yun Kong remembers, three lives dream long. Even if there is romance, half of the face remains. Ask Vimo, why stay in the stream of fragrance. Such immortal companions are hard to hide in a golden house.</p>
<h3>A Record of Snow on Gushan Mountain to Find Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>He Haisheng sent from Hangzhou</p>
<p>A few days ago, spring snow was flying, day and night. The white Yuqiong Building in Hangzhou has become a silver world. West Lake is also very colorful. The beauty of nature is more believable than artificial art.</p>
<p>I could endure the cold, so I invited Lu and Zhai to go to West Lake to play in the snow. When we arrived at the lake, there were no boats. The high mountains were covered with snow, like wearing white fur. Thin ice floats on the surface of the water, and the wind is slightly rippling. Zhai wanted to go to Gushan Mountain to find plum blossoms. Lu was healthy enough to walk directly to the place. We drank tea at Gushan Tea House. The plums are divided into five colors: big red, pink, green, white, and yellow. Snow accumulates on the branches, and they all look white from a distance. The jade bones and ice muscles are ethereal and immortal. It is appropriate for the hermit Lin to love it like a wife. I improvised a poem: "The empty pavilion is silent at the foot of Gushan Mountain. Jade bones and ice muscles, thousands of trees and plums. Ask the romantic hermit Lin, can the crane come back when the moon is bright?" We visited the tomb of hermit Lin. There is a crane tomb next to it, both covered with snow. His pure breeze and bright festival can be imagined as his person. The three of us mourned in the snow for a long time, and all envied his pile of yellow [blank], which has remained famous for thousands of years, and will be immortal with West Lake.</p>
<p>We sat and walked back to the lake. We had dinner at Juxian Pavilion. It was nine o'clock when we returned home. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>Qing Dynasty Talk in the Book World Countryman</h3>
<p>Tang Zailiang, who lectured on Romance of the Three Kingdoms, is also a backbone member of the Guangyu Society. It was originally scheduled to work with Shen Jian'an and Xue Xiaoqing, who sang and played the Pearl Tower, on the 17th of the lunar calendar. During the day, he opened a book in Qunyulou, and in the evening, he opened a book in Chunfeng Deyilou on the same day. However, Shen and Xue had a very close friendship with Wang Yunfeng, who lectured on Jinqiang Fu. Therefore, they openly declared that they were unwilling to cooperate with Tang, and waited for Tang to choose himself. If Tang did Qunyulou day and night, Shen, Xue, and Wang would do Deyilou. If Tang decided to do Deyilou, Shen and the other three would do Qunyu. If Tang wanted to do both places day and night, Shen and the others would not do one place. However, the owners of the two venues both held the bear's paw and fish at the same time, and they were unwilling to give in. Later, Zhu Yaoting and others tried to mediate and focused on the four words "suitable for people and places." They probably persuaded Tang to do Qunyu alone, and Deyilou would be taken over by Shen and the other three.</p>
<p>The Great World Amusement Park still plans to add a book venue and invite Zhao Xiaoqing, Zhao Hesun, and others to take over. According to legend, on the evening of February 14, Xiaoqing's father and son's residence (Guianli, Glock Road, French Concession) was suddenly robbed and robbed of clothes, jewelry, etc., worth about four or five hundred gold. Xiaoqing did not know the legal procedures, so he did not report the arrest and ask for arrest. It is not easy to live in Chang'an. Really. (Unstamped)</p>
<h3>Tobacco Ridicule Ji Jin</h3>
<p>Tobacco has no benefits to hygiene. However, everyone likes it. In recent times, the sales market has become wider day by day. And Virginia in North America has become the center of the world's tobacco. According to legend, before Columbus arrived in America, the people of Europe and the West did not smoke at all. I don’t know what tobacco is. Since Mr. Ke returned, a shipowner named Lailai brought him home. One day, he tried to sit alone and smoke it. His servant was serving the basin to enter. Seeing the smoke coming out of the master's mouth and nose, he thought it was fire. He was shocked. Before he could call for help, he poured the water from the basin and poured it on his head. Mr. Lai didn't know why he was soaked thoroughly. Really a fun story.</p>
<p>Since tobacco was imported into Europe, the whole country has been smoking hard. Almost without this gentleman for a day. And Virginia's supply fell short of demand. Therefore, the countries of Jiqian Di, Beikal Le, and Nadiev Foss also developed land and widely planted. Seed in early spring and ripen in late autumn. Harvest and bake it dry. Carried to the market. In total, the annual production should reach US$2,640 trillion. One-third of them are distributed in the Americas and two-thirds in Europe and Asia. The number is also huge.</p>
<p>Since tobacco is a pastime for civilized people, I don’t know that it contains a lot of toxins. The so-called nicotine. According to a Westerner, one English mile can kill two or three people. Fortunately, half of it is burned off when it is burned and smoked. However, the harm is also not small. We are working hard writing, with a cigarette in hand. It is said that it can help grow literary thoughts. It seems that we have never felt any impact. By the time we are older and the energy is already weak, we gradually develop chronic carbon poisoning, which is incurable. This is what those who study hygiene should pay attention to.</p>
<p>▲ Short News The dancer Ms. Violet. Good at Beijing and Cantonese opera, her name shook the north and south. Recently, in the Nanjing Road Municipal Hall, a united collection of famous ladies from the pavilion, and the stars of the brother and dance, sold very well. Programs such as Spring is Deep, Mandarin Ducks Playing in the Water, Crescent Moon, Peach and Plum Competing for Spring, Dragon and Tiger Fighting, Selling Flower Words, Butterfly Girl, Innocence, Flower of Love. Ms. Chen Miaochang's Cantonese opera, Beijing opera sitting in the palace, Suzhou ditty, comedy Half Chicken, toe dance, Violet Dance, etc. are all masterpieces. (Rui Hongchu)</p>
<h3>South Seas Travelogue (123) - Flowers</h3>
<p>Most travelers to Siam are from Chaozhou, Guangdong. There are also Jiangzhe Guild Halls. There was once a carpenter who, due to his carpentry skills in construction, gained the trust of the Siamese King, leading to great wealth. This was because the former Siamese King appreciated the beauty of engineering and did not haggle over prices. However, Siamese workers are not like that now; they calculate everything carefully before proceeding. The Siamese King is young and studied in England, so he can speak English. However, he appointed a certain Chinese gentleman to manage Chinese Buddhist affairs, even though he is not well-versed in Buddhism, simply because he can speak Siamese.</p>
<p>Besides commerce, the industries of Chinese living abroad are also noteworthy. There are many Luban Temples in various places. Siam, Burma, and India all have remarkable woodworking industries, mostly run by people from Guangdong. In northern Burma, some have become wealthy by contracting civil engineering projects. One gentleman initially handled clerical work with a monthly income of only one hundred yuan but made tens of thousands within two years by contracting work as a foreman for a British company. There is a type of woodworking where Chinese are earning a lot of money from the Japanese. Everywhere in Japan, we see the Japanese using fine redwood furniture, all the time. Small tables and Buddhist altars are especially common. Formerly, it was thought to be produced in Japan, but later it was known to be entirely made by Chinese. The wood comes from the South Seas, and the manufacturing takes place in Guangdong and Shanghai, making it a major Chinese export. Furthermore, ivory, lapis lazuli, jade, and other materials are produced in Siam and Burma. Chinese merchants transport them to Shanghai and Guangdong, where Chinese workers craft them into various utensils for export to Europe and America. From this, it can be seen that Chinese craftsmanship is naturally developed. It is a pity that they do not know how to improve.</p>
<p>On the 12th, I visited Mr. Liu Guangsu's sawmill on Vinton Street. It uses machinery for sawing and has a capital of 200,000 yuan. According to him, business has declined by about seven or eight times compared to the past. Examining the reasons, part of it is due to the impact of Gandhi's anti-British movement. Indians do not use any machinery, and construction has come to a standstill. Gandhi is a restorationist who uses methods that go backward and overthrow commercial policies. In Burma, there are quite a few Chinese sawmills, mostly run by Cantonese people. A certain Mr. Li and his brothers are engaged in this business. According to him, there are three types of Burmese wood. The first type is Xian wood, also called Mali, or Teak. This wood is the most durable and the most expensive and indispensable for shipbuilding because it is resistant to collisions. The largest sales are to Britain, mainly for shipbuilding, especially for warships. I think that as long as the world does not cease war for a day, the best materials will be sacrificed for war. The next best is Ding Sha wood, or Eng. The next is red wood, or Ponkato (transliteration of Burmese). These woods all come from northern Burma, but they are not the same as the red wood used in Guangdong furniture. They are very suitable for railway sleepers. Mr. Li said that all construction wood in China should be transported from Burma. However, I have visited a Japanese sawmill company in the three eastern provinces with a capital of one million, and I know that the eastern provinces are not lacking in large timber, but it is a pity that it has not been transported out.</p>
<p>On the 20th, I received a letter from Liu Tingbi of the Pengcheng Liu Clan Association in Bassein, requesting me to write a couplet for the Pengcheng Liu Clan. I had long wanted to go to the countryside to learn about local customs, so I replied by telegram, indicating that I would arrive at the Pengcheng Guild Hall immediately. I boarded the ship at 4 PM, second class for nine yuan. There were absolutely no amenities, the electric fan was not working, and the room could not even accommodate a table. Strangely, there was no shower. So, it cost three times as much for nothing. Ordinary class costs less than three yuan. The second class on these ships is not as spacious as a train. I met a black Indian who spoke English very well. We debated briefly, and he strongly advocated for racial equality and intermarriage. He then said with emotion, "I am but a slave, with no right to speak." Along the river, I saw a lot of duckweed, floating in the water in large groups, which was very beautiful. Occasionally, in the setting sun, the golden pagodas and green trees reflected each other, which is a beautiful scene of Burma. The ship sailed southwest, and there were many large factories across the river from Yangon.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, Liu Dongxian (also known as Tingbi) and many members of the Liu clan were waiting at the station to greet me. We took a car to the Pengcheng Guild Hall, which had two elementary schools. It is said that there are several hundred Liu families here. Dongxian's mother was Burmese, and his father was from Anxi, Fujian. He returned to China at the age of fifteen and graduated from the Business Department of China University in Beijing. He stayed in China for eighteen years before returning to Burma. His mother passed away long ago, but he still enjoys the Burmese scenery. I came to Bassein and stayed with Liu at Liu Wenjian's Quan Yuan business. Liu is the director of the Pengcheng Guild Hall. That evening, the guild hall hosted a banquet. There were not many Liu family members present because most of them were in the countryside. After dinner, we took a car to tour various parts of Bassein. There is an aircraft factory to the north, as well as Catholic and Jesus churches. Bassein is the largest famous port in the southwest corner of Burma. It can be seen on the map, located between India and the South Seas, connecting to India. Large European and American ships can sail directly into the inner harbor. Rice is the main commercial commodity. In the past, the British wanted to establish their capital here instead of Yangon, but it did not happen, which shows its importance. Bassein is written as Pathein on the map.</p>

<h3>First Place: Bai Wan</h3>
<p>The exams are almost over.</p>
<p>There is only one subject left, which doesn't require preparation or studying, and can be taken with the exam. Therefore, most students are sitting in their dorms chatting. Judging from their tired expressions and sleepless eyes, the exams have left a severe and terrible impression on them. They must have suffered a lot and spent a lot of effort for it. So, in this moment of near completion, they are like workers who have put down a heavy load to rest. Everyone is relieved, and their hearts feel much happier and more relaxed.</p>
<p>The scope of their conversations in the dorm at this time,</p>
<p>is probably nothing more than how not to easily let go of this winter vacation, and how to compensate for the fatigue and loss of playtime suffered during the preparation for the exams. Some are talking about how happy it will be to sit around with their older and younger sisters and mothers at home, spending the Lunar New Year. Students who have no home to return to are discussing inviting a few classmates to organize a winter vacation accommodation for students staying on campus, preparing to make their lives artistic and interesting. They rarely talk about the exam questions this time, because this matter is considered past, and talking about it is too boring, or it will make them angry. There are always a few students who regret in their hearts that they answered a certain exam question incorrectly, or are jealous that others got first place and they failed.</p>
<p>"Hey, talking about these advance pleasures is meaningless. I have a suggestion, which is to make the atmosphere at this moment happy and interesting. Do you agree?"</p>
<p>At this time, Lin, who was sitting quietly like a child, suddenly jumped up and said this.</p>
<p>"Good, I second it," said Qiong, nicknamed "Sharp-Mouth," echoing.</p>
<p>"My suggestion is..." Jing pulled the corner of Lin's clothes, meaning to stop her from speaking. Lin herself smiled at Fen, who was sitting in the east corner of the dorm, lost in thought.</p>
<p>"Speak, hurry up and speak," Sharp-Mouth urged.</p>
<p>"I won't say it, alas, it's too pitiful. If I say it in a moment, I'm afraid I'll cry," Lin said, stopping after hearing Jing's instructions.</p>
<p>"No, saying half a sentence like this will shorten your life and leave us all confused," said someone named Ying. Sharp-Mouth got up and pulled Lin, insisting that she had to speak.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll say it," Lin finally said, her eyes never leaving Fen. "My suggestion is that we are too bored sitting here doing nothing. Why not think of a way to get some money, buy something, and have a meal together?"</p>
<p>"Where's the way?" asked Li, the famous king of good food, hurriedly.</p>
<p>"The way is," Lin looked at Fen and smiled, "whoever is the first place in this exam, invites everyone."</p>
<p>"Good, good..."</p>
<p>"Agree, agree..."</p>
<p>It seemed everyone was looking at Fen, because Fen got the most points in this exam.</p>
<p>"Now let's examine who is the first place in our exam this time," Ying said deliberately.</p>
<p>"Besides Fen, who else? Isn't she the first in every subject?" Sharp-Mouth said directly.</p>
<p>"Then, please our first-place Fen quickly sacrifice a few dollars to treat us," said Li, the king of good food.</p>
<p>"Fen, take out the money and treat us," everyone said.</p>
<p>At this time, Fen said calmly, "Okay, a few dollars is nothing, but I don't have a single cent right now, I'll treat you another day, okay?"</p>
<p>"No, no, we want to eat right now."</p>
<p>"If you don't have money, I'll lend it to you."</p>
<p>Everyone surrounded Fen, insisting that she take out the money immediately, but Fen insisted on not agreeing.</p>
<p>"Hey, you all don't know how to handle things," said Jing, who had first stopped Lin from making the proposal. "If you want someone to treat, you have to give them gifts and congratulations first, and then worry about them not taking out the money."</p>
<p>The school will assign mentors to athletes based on their subjects. This mentor will be with the students day and night, reviewing the material they did not understand in the lecture hall, or the material they missed due to absence. The mentor will explain the exercises in the material to the athlete, making sure they fully understand the difficulties. Before the exam, the mentor will fully present the important points of the entire book, allowing the student to review it so they can pass the exam. This measure by the school provides much help to the athletes' academics, ensuring that their exam scores will not be too poor. In the future, they can also apply what they have learned to serve society. According to the principal of the school, the athletes sacrifice their academics for the school, which is pitiful. If they are not given remediation, their grades will be too poor, and they will not be able to graduate. If they are casually promoted and graduated, the school rules do not allow it, so this method was established. Most of the mentors are recent graduates of the school.</p>
<h3>Dedicated to Miss X Who is About to Marry - Shi Yi</h3>
<p>The cold and severe weather is blowing a fierce wind that scrapes the skin, immersed in this gray atmosphere, making people feel cold and shudder. Many friends are huddling by the warm stove to roast fire, but I am alone at my desk, writing this blessing to a friend.</p>
<p>Girl, I was once a good friend of yours. During the period at X University, you were praised by the male students as the so-called university flower. You were the modern lady who caused a sensation throughout the school. Girl, you were so charming at that time, so beautiful, with soft hair draped over your shoulders, revealing a round apple-like delicate face. Two lively eyes that seemed about to roll out seemed to contain infinite affection.</p>
<p>Thin lips often revealed pearly white teeth, wearing a Chinese-Western fusion cheongsam, high-heeled leather shoes, making the students willingly surrender beneath your pomegranate skirt. At that time, you were also rich in poetic talent and were called a female poet. Your gorgeous image could often be seen on Xima Road, and you were a smart and lively girl, firmly believing in being a social butterfly. I can recall many things here from my memories.</p>
<p>In your dormitory, there were often friends from afar who yearned for the saint, especially the students from our school. I remember your bedroom was a small square room with artistic wallpaper, movie posters, and various colored paper flowers. In one corner of the wall was a bed with iron bars, red, green, and beautiful bedding. In the middle was a writing desk with many decorations, so that no one who had been there did not praise your bedroom. "Miss X, you are truly gifted with intelligence, rich in artistic talent. You can arrange such an ordinary room so exquisitely." Another person would continue, "Miss X's literature is very good. Don't you see the poems that are often published in the Central Daily News?" At that time, you were very proud to receive the awards from your classmates. Girl, in the past, you were worth being proud of in a very glorious page in your life history.</p>
<p>I recently heard good news that in the near future, you will encounter a happy day. You will be wearing light and flowing scarlet georgette, beautiful and fashionable clothing, holding the hand of your groom in the auditorium. You, this passionate girl, are giving your girlish pure love to him for the sake of loving him. For this, Miss X, who is about to marry, before you marry, I want to sincerely bless you and tell you, do not forget how fortunate and glorious you were in your past life. I hope that the gentle and red brilliance of your life will always shine like the sun and moon. I hope that your beautiful youth will always be stored in the rose garden, surrounded by the waters of spring, forever preserving the vivid flowers. I also pray that my friend will seek a line of light in the women's world, and that you will present people's songs of joy among female writers. With the sincerity of your love, may you always preserve happiness in the world. With the passion of your love, may you build a great career in the future. Girl, the short words of blessing you see are some light gifts flowing from my heart to you. Do not forget that she was once a close companion on the island of friendship in the past, and she sincerely blesses you in a corner of West Shanghai.</p>

<p>Marshal Foch's War Diary (Continued) - Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The Second Army gradually regained its confidence. Duchesne arrived and had a better effect. The army no longer talked about retreat. Retreat was something I explicitly forbade. The cavalry did not have enough courage.</p>
<p>Whenever you need me, I can return to Romilly. However, my troops here have not yet been deployed and have not yet resumed their advance, so I cannot leave. Our war zone is very wide, from Dinsèque to La Laire and Noon, so many unexpected accidents are possible. Foch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you and General Franchet d'Espèrey agree, I propose that our left wing (the Tenth Army) advance from La Laire towards the Scheldt River, with Don, Armentières and Vaux as its target. The British army advances to the north of La Laire, forming a line from Don to Coura Laire. In this way, the French, British, and Belgian detachments can form a line on the left bank of the Scheldt River and the Lys River.</p>
<p>Because Commander-in-Chief Franchet d'Espèrey hoped that on October 10th, a corps (the Second Corps) and two cavalry divisions would engage between Baizain and Aire, and on October 12th, the Third Corps and two cavalry divisions would engage between Baizain and Saint-Omer, we prepared on the 10th to immediately attack and clear the line. The details of the arrangement are as follows:</p>
<p>Under the current situation of the Allied forces, the first thing to do is to carefully complete the union of the British and French armies. The Allied forces have been dispersed by the recent battles.</p>
<p>The area north and east of La Laire, between the Scheldt and Lys rivers, seems to be a suitable battlefield for this operation.</p>
<p>If tomorrow, the 11th, and the day after tomorrow, the 12th, the left wing of the French Tenth Army receives the assistance of the British army (the 200th Regiment and divisions), and can fight on the Baizain-Merville line, then the road to La Laire can be expected to be cleared.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seems that there are no heavy troops stationed in the northern area of the Merville-Hazebrouck-Cassel line (which is our defense area). Under this situation, on the morning of the 13th, the left wing of the French army can confidently advance towards La Laire, and then towards Don. The right wing of the British army advances towards the area north of La Laire, and then towards Nieuport. The center of the British army advances towards Coura Laire.</p>
<p>By controlling the Scheldt River with Don and the Lys River with Coura Laire, the British, French, and Belgian troops can leisurely meet behind the two rivers.</p>
<p>If the commander-in-chief of the British army agrees to these plans, the French army can act on the Oustre-Esterve-Aitun-Van Gier-Berzie-La Laire-Don route and the southern route. The British army can use the northern route. Please approve the above plan. Foch.</p>
<p>Sir Franchet d'Espèrey was quite able to assist the French army with all his strength and speed, but due to the delay in disembarking, the first division of the British Third Corps did not gather until the afternoon of the 13th, and the entire army was not ready to advance until the evening of the 15th. (To be continued)</p>
