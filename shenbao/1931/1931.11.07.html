<p>十一月十六瞬已將屈而日政府不特無絲毫遵照國聯决議開始撤退軍隊之意。甚且調軍西進。襲擊通遼嫩江且已發生直接衝突。一切公理與和平之呼籲事實已證實其毫無補益。東北三千萬人民處於異族蹂躙之下。旦夕企望援救。而暴軍西進。關内各地且將受嚴重之威脅此時蓋已逹到外交上最嚴重之時期</p>
<p>在今日吾人試一問蒙昧之學童。以目前何事爲最切要。其答語必爲（對外）。問村野之農夫。答語當亦相同。「一致對外。」蓋已爲舉國人民之公意舉國人民一致之迫切要求雖三尺孩提無知愚氓亦知目前非「一致對外」不足以抗暴不足以圖存昨日上海金融界之迫切呼翻今日工學界代表之請願全滬學生聞將每人投函和會。涕泣勸告東北請願圑千人日内亦將到京沉痛要求。至於蹈海自殺絕食呼籲者。尤時有所聞人民之意志已堅固凝结翹企統一和平。共赴國難殷如望歲奈之何袞袞當局竟不能覺悟及此也</p>
<p>自東北禍變爆發以來日本朝野上下都以全力對付此一問題各界紛紛舉行「满洲時局懇談會。」各種刋物。亦側重於此一問題之討論被爲來侵而朝野尙一致注目不稍放鬆我爲受害禍患迫在眉睫而我當局尙斷斷於對内之爭持。不肯一舉目向外此眞事之最令人威喟悲痛不能自已者也　　夫今日京粤雙方之爭持。其目的究何在如在於「國是一則」「統一和平」「一致對外。一即所以紆國難即爲國是之最重要者但使雙方皆具此初衷。則一切爭執皆有商量讓步之餘地何至各執已見使和議日趨於黯淡若是乎　吾人以爲雙方領袖。宜勿忘其「在黨同志。」在國爲同胞」民猶是也國猶是也三民主義亦猶是也所不能統一和平者則諸領袖之本身耳豆　自煎坐來外侮史册听載遺恨千秋吾人誠不解雙方領袖言時似未　不覺悟及此。而何以爭執時。仍不能絲毫放鬆也。</p>
<p>今日之事無國即無黨更將無諸領袖之自身民族淪胥無分京　國將不國。寗論私見。故今日惟一致對外乃能解决内爭。惟一致對外乃能挽救危亡若齗齗於對内問題爭意氣上一日之短長以及權勢上一時之勝負則國家民族之前途殆將不能說不忍說。</p>
<p>吾人切盼雙方領袖。一致移其對内之視線。轉而向外移其内爭之精神　而抗外。吾人更切盼雙方領袖爲中華民族留一綫之生機母使國脈民命自我而斷絕設如孫中山先生九泉而有知者。吾人敢斷言其希冀企求於雙方者。當亦不外乎是。</p>

<p>四○、壓迫奉天城居住日人、奉天者依一九○三年中美通商條約、已經開放、奉天中國官憲、在奉天城外設定商埠地、以此爲限、不許外國人居住營業、固執不當之主張、不顧日本並關係諸國之屢次抗議、對城内居住日人、以迫害之方法、使之立退、於最近結果、城内殘留者僅四十四戶、</p>
<p>四一、壓迫三姓城内居住日人、吉林省三姓者於明治二十八年依滿洲條約附屬書已經開放、中國官憲爲與奉天同様不當之主張、三姓城内居住日人、直接間接加以壓迫、居信營業使之困難、現在殘留者僅不過五六戶、又新居住及營業者、則有絶對不可能狀態、</p>
<p>四二、壓迫奉天城内日本電話、基於明治四十一年中日電信協約、日本於奉天滿鐵附屬地及奉天城内之間、有保留電話經營之權利契約、二年前中國官憲爲改正奉天省内市區、前來相商、要求移植電柱、將右電線改作鉛包線式、减少電柱、昨年底着手城内工事全部終了、至本年八月間、奉天電政管理處以些須技術上之口實、於商埠地阻害接續工事、與日方經營以最大之妨害、</p>

<h3 id="c75">接要聞 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>金、昭和六年六月、右規則幾經修正、改爲國土盜賣懲辦罰則、蹂躪日本人條約上最重要之權利、右規則發布之結果、前記條約全歸空文、不但將來商租權之獲得、已不可能、而且對本規則發布以前之旣得權、亦着着奪回、例如昭和四年三月、潘陽縣門臺子東亞勸業會社、由華人李雲飛商租土地廿四日畝、計金一萬元、遼寗省政府以委員會之决議、處右地主脅以死刑、至昭和五年一月、東亞勸業將已入手右關係之地劵、救該地主之命、是屬事實、右不法法令發布之結果、此一兩年來、一·新民縣縣長爲縣下七公臺之土地買與日人、將地主監禁、二·柳河縣因華人趙書緩將土地商租與東亞勸業、乃没收其地追放日本管理人、（東山農塲問題）三·本溪縣以華人將煤山租與日人爲理由、將地主監禁、企圖没收煤山、四·輯安縣華人租屋與日本警察派出所、將家主監禁、五·遼寗省對各地散在鮮人之水田經營、遂循例不辭租地現存之耕種契約、亦行否認、出以改作單純僱傭契約之方針、其例不遑枚舉、（乙）吉林省亦與奉天省同様、發布國土盜賣禁止令、依間島協約、不顧鮮人之土地所有權又其他於吉林省各地鮮人、不但不能買土地、即耕作契約期限等、亦受干涉、</p>
<p>四四、妨害朝鮮人居住耕作、最近對在滿各地朝鮮人之居住耕作等、中國官憲直接間接加以壓迫、除前記妨害租地耕作契約外、又出新規、躡逐移住者、禁止租房、妨礙營業、强迫華人之地主家主、不但令鮮人立退、且依塲合行使實力、例如一·本年六月、吉林省官憲於萬寳山企圖驅逐鮮人、對地主與鮮人之耕作契約、加以不當之干涉、二·同年七月、吉林省於陶賴昭藉口取締共産黨、驅逐多數善良鮮農之現移住者、三·同年八月間、通遼中國官憲關於鮮人醫師與病家之間、所謂誤診問題、發生民事的　爭事件、遂爲奇貨、同醫師之營業禁止强制立退、所有、事例、不遑枚舉、</p>
<p>四五、對朝鮮人不法逮捕處罰、最近東三省中國官憲、對在滿鮮人、不顧條約、擅行逮捕監禁、大都不用何等裁判手續、判以數月乃至一年以上之監禁、此項事件、在奉天監獄尙有六十餘名、敦化約有四十名、吉林、一百三十餘名、哈爾濱約四十名、</p>
<p>四六、否認吉林省裁判所之日本人治外法權判决、觀吉林省法庭對某鮮人秘告判决文、認爲有日本國籍、迨後與日本之通商條約旣已滿期無效、日本人無治外法權、須服中國法庭之判决云云可證、</p>
<p>四七、不履地間島條約、間島協約規定、有鮮人之土地所有權、乃中國密發禁止盜賣國土密令、不許鮮人獲得土地所有權、又鮮人有米穀輸出之自由、中國阴阻止之、對間島鮮人、以産米不得賣與對岸朝鮮、受經濟上大打擊、（間島米價比鮮約半價）再間島協約關於人命、鮮人爲被告、須知照日本國領事而不聞實行、（參照前項吉會線）</p>
<p>四八、排日敎材普及之件、近年中國政府全國普通敎育之敎科書内、編入幾多排日材料、涵養小國民對日之復仇心、有悖國際信義、且爲反中日親善根本意義之重大事件、</p>
<p>四九、東北文化社排日宣傳、該社爲奉天官憲之機關、常爲排日的放送、最著者本年二月、撫順煤坑大山坑自然發火之際（稱爲爆發非彼程度）未死一人、乃宣傳有坑夫爆死之宣傳、日本抗議而不取消</p>
<p>五○、遼寗國民外交協會排日運動、遼寗國民外交協會以排爲主目的、在昭和四年六月組織、最近發行機關雜誌、日常集會、又利用新聞、極力對日爲惡宣傳、致中日之感情極端惡化、</p>
<p>五一、壓迫盛京時報、奉天日人經營之漢字盛京時報、爲滿洲言論機關中最高權威、博内外信用、乃對其公正社說、有不利奉天當局之塲合逾濫用官權、如以壓迫、事實不少、最近顯著之例、如自昭和二年至三年約亘十個月間、對其發殿、加以澈底的妨害、阻止送達、殆有營業不可能之况、與以莫大之損害、其後時行壓迫、去年六月始至八月亦然、又本年七月至八月、奉天公安局長暗與遼寗國民外交協會相結、將奉天有力之該報販賣人、逮捕監禁於公安局、加以間接的卑劣的迫害、</p>
<p>五二、内地旅行執照差别待遇、去年十月間、奉天及遼源交涉員對洮南以西地方、及吉林省北部地方、以禁止日人游歷爲目的、最近在與大連競爭地位之葫蘆島、亦有日人游歷之限劃、對日人之護照、以禁止的箋註與諸外國人比較、與以差别的待遇、日本屢次抗議、不但不反省、且在最近訓令鐵嶺遼陽安東營口通化海龍等處之交涉員、亦與奉天遼源同様限制、</p>
<p>五三、妨害通遼農塲、對於通遼東亞勸業經營之農塲、今春築造防水堤防、該縣公安局帶同多數巡警、向苦力小屋放火、驅逐從業苦力、</p>
<p>五四、中村大尉事件、中村大尉率引井杉延太郎及蒙古人一名、俄人一保、在興安屯墾區方面旅行中、本年七月二十六日、被蘇鄂公府駐屯軍第三團浸捕、並全部殺害、右之事實、極其明瞭、日方屢次强硬交涉、乃奉天當局最初則否認事實、其後否認不可能時、又藉種種口實、希圖迴避責任、（完）</p>

<p>暴日稱我東三省爲「滿洲」，且有所謂「南滿」與「北滿」。這是他們早存侵略之心，就定下含有麻醉性的名詞；我們應當名正言順，稱之爲「東三省」或是遼，吉，黑三省，而不當附和。然而報章，雜誌，仍有沿用「南滿」「北滿」的，彷彿是默認這不倫不類的名詞，怎麽可以呢？</p>
<p>近有人提議改稱「日本」爲「賊邦」，以名符其實，我很贊成此議。像日本那様兇暴，殘忍，無所不爲，無惡不作，目無公理，慘無人道，跡其行爲，非「盜賊之邦」而何？我報界同人，倘以爲不謬，以後請一律改稱「日本」爲「賊邦」丨</p>

<p>一位很開通的新時代的老板對他的一位半工半讀的夥計說：、</p>
<p>「鐘點到了，你該去上課吧。」</p>
<p>那忠於店務的夥計，聽了這話，看看鐘，又看看老板說：「我今天想歇一天，同學們都說我上課上得太起勁，好像是爲先生捧塲。」</p>
<p>老板聽得這個意想之外的答復，當時没有說什麽，事後遇了一位懂得敎育内幕的朋友、談及此事、那位朋友想了一忽兒，笑嘻嘻的說：</p>
<p>「少上幾次課，可以省些車錢多買幾本書看、比聽敎授們的演講好得多。這算盤是你的同事比你打得準確。」</p>

<p>倭寇之一再犯我華夏。彰諸史册。庚子年義和團之舉。八國聯軍。蹂躪吾土。御園一炬。帝子蒙塵。爲遜清一代之巨變。當八國聯軍之長驅直入也。倭奴寳爲前鋒。并司門禁之職。我友張廉翁。</p>
<p>素爲京華寓公。識宫中老監某甲。某甲於當年事。固身臨目覩者。謂倭奴之入宫搜掠。較諸任何國爲貪狠。曾攫去禁内寳物多種。據予（某甲自稱）所知者。有翡翠瓶一事。瓶高丈二尺。湛然純碧。夏日置室中。五六尺内。自生凉意。不啻燕昭王之銷暑招凉珠也。慈禧后綦愛之。倭奴倉皇盜攫。扛舁不愼。墮地而中斷。斷裂之瓶。仍由倭奴輦往東島。細碎之小塊遺地未檢者。娥監拾之。後由骨董商售諸西邦。</p>
<p>獲十餘萬金。則其瓶之價値可知矣。一水晶馬。大如尋常坐騎。統體瑩澈。宫娥賜浴後。常跨之以爲嬉戲。美人芳澤之所遺。靡堪珍惜也。又雍正御用之象牙蓆。削象牙爲薄片。編之而成龍紋之簟。工夫之細密。若出鬼製。聞編作此蓆者。費半載之光隂。不分晝夜以爲之。及成。其人以目力消耗太甚。竟致失明。專制帝王之威福。於此亦可見一斑。其他珊瑚作樹。鋪金屑以爲泥。明月侔珠。琢白玉以爲匣。倭奴予取予求。不知輦去多少。大内精華。喪失殆盡。言之殊痛心也。此次瀋陽之變。東北富藏。刦掠任意。尤可惜者。厥爲四庫全書。文物之價値。更非玉帛玩好所得比擬。引領北望。興慨無窮已。</p>

<p>不會沈没的船</p>
<p>世界上一個最偉大的發明。就是那種自救而不致光没的船。這種新發明的方法。已行之於救生船。很有效騐。就是割去西瓜片般一塊木片。那麽在水中無論怎様的情形。可立即回復回舊。最近又有一個驚人的發明。宣告於世。却實實在在是一艘不會沈没的船。發明者是一位法國人約瑟夏得林氏Joseph　Dharttain他製成一艘大西洋中郵船的模型。長十二英尺。重半噸。給一般造船專家去試騐。他們用了鐵棒在那船身水線以下的部分。戮了許多大窟窿。若是一艘大船。照様的戮了這些窟窿。那一定要在一二分鐘之間。沈没大海之底。這是毫無疑義的。但是這艘模型的船。雖戮滿了窟窿。却只降下了一二英寸。依舊很驕傲似的浮在水面。這様的船隻。要是流行於全世界。眞是航海者的福音。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>「朱毛的價値，爲什麽這様漲起來的呢？」他要餂出鄉下人的話兒，便假裝着請敎的様子。</p>
<p>「大概因爲出洋的關傃吧。」鄉下人顚頭播腦，不住吸着他的旱烟桿。</p>
<p>「對了對了！」這位偵探先生暗暗地忖思。「我曾經聽得人家說過：好多共産黨曾經出過洋的。朱毛也是留學生，曾經到過西洋的。現在他說爲了出洋的關係，使他們價値增高，這話更對了。誰想這様一個鄉下人，却是共産黨呢？</p>
<p>「出洋便增高價値嗎？」偵探先生淡淡地問了一句。</p>
<p>「怎麽产增高價値。」鄉下人又大發其議論了。「現在的時代，什麽東西都要沾染些洋氣。中國的話不說，反要說洋話。中國的衣服不穿，反要穿洋式衣服。中國的老婆不要，反要討洋婆。其實我們中國什麽東西没有？帶了點洋氣，就算是時髦人。」他發了這篇安内攘外論，眼睛還注視着對面那位看報的西裝青年，爲了春宫畫報的爭論，好像有些兒餘怒未平。</p>
<p>「朱毛的價値，爲什麽因爲了出過洋便增漲起來呢？」偵探先生又緊追了一步。這好似獵狗見兎，豈肯經輕放過。</p>
<p>『這很容易明白的。那猪毛是肥田用的，逃不出我們鄉下種田人的手裏，除了肥田之外，也没有别種用途，所以那班殺猪屠，都要買給我們的。現在聽說那種東西也洋洋了，外國人想出了新花様，除了肥田之外，還有别種用塲。到底是什麽用塲，他又秘而不宣，可是被他們一收買，猪毛就飛漲起來了。從前是幾塊錢一擔的，現在漲到幾十塊錢一擔。』</p>
<p>『什麽幾塊錢一擔？幾十塊錢一擔？我問你的是朱毛呀。』</p>
<p>『不差！我就告訴你是猪毛的價錢呀。』</p>
<p>『我問你的是共産黨的朱毛。』</p>
<p>『我告訴你的是肥田的猪毛』</p>
<p>『呸！眞是纒夾不清。』偵探先生大失所望：他本想趁此機會，可以得一個大大功勞，獲一筆大大賞金。不想我們心中的朱毛。變了他心中的猪毛，倒上了這個鄉下老頭兒的一個當。他氣極了，還是納頭睡他的覺，再裝着假睡，聽聽那班三等客人，有什麽高論。</p>

<p>聽到學工兩位代表所說的話、兄弟想有些說說、兄弟是代表廣東方面各同人的意見、作一個簡單的答復、關於只個和平會議的内容、没有一件不公開的、所有議案、除了少部份之外、其餘每天都在報上發表、其少部份、也不是存心秘密、而且對外交方面的問題、有三兩點未發表、這當然不是之同胞不肯公開、不過因爲外交問題、不便讓外國知道、很少部份不發表的、就是這個原故、此點是希望各位同胞要原諒的、說到和平會議經過、首兩天係對外交問題、這當然是爲國難、當然須緊急應付的緣故、說到外交問題、南京政府因爲已得了國際的承認、交涉進行、當然應該由南京政府去做、而對外交方針及原則、則决在本會議决定、交南京政府去實行、剛才蔡先生說、外交已經一致的話、乃是確當的、不過所謂外交一致源則、應該是有限度的、如外兵侵入而言無抵抗、喪失國土而無人負責、當然不贊同、不在外交一致範圍之内、其後兩天、本會議便開始討論「中央政制改革案」這些、在報上各位想已看過了、廣東代表此行原意、就是先對外求外交一致之後、對内便由雙方組織統一會議、由統一會議産生統一政府、新政府成立之後、南京蔣先生即行辭職、廣東國民政府即取消、在此事實行之前、先由雙方對國民作一個願意取消的表示、這就是說各發表一個通電、這是最先蔡張陳三先生與我們會商的原意、也是廣東方面所堅决之主張、這是也我們來滬就商之原意、這個意思、絲毫不必對各位隱瞞的、因爲我們覺得一個國家、有統一力量的政府、然後才可表現對外的力量、對内然後求得民主政治基礎的樹立、以前的是非、也不要說就趕快從新做過來、應付這緊急的局面、這個意思、也就是本會議寗粤雙方同志大家狠虛心去求解决的問題、剛才蔡先生也說過了、到後來南京方面的意見、覺得中央政制改革案、不能就這様决定、應該在四全大會裏邊解决、廣東的原意、是先改組政府、後來才去南京開四全會、南京意思、又以爲中央政治制度的改革、必須我四全大會裏頭解决、所以又主張先開四全會、他們並以爲聯已限日本於十六號撤兵了、那麽、我們最好便要在十六號以前十二號、便在南京開四全大會、表示我們中國的一致、所以兩方的意見不同、現在所認爲困難者乃在此點、有些人問我、粤方代表、怎的不到南京開會、這因爲南京政府、未有改組、我們不好去</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>南京、在上海開會的例、本黨以前、也有很多、像民國十六年十二月、那不是曾經在滬開過的、但是或許說、你們在上海開會、太不成話、豈不表示分崩的裂痕、兄弟以爲事實還是事實、國民黨分離的事實、應該要承認的、剛才學生代表說是黨的責任、這是不錯、這個責任、應該國民黨去負、今天國民黨人去反對國民黨人政府、不要以爲北洋軍閥的政府袁世凱的政府、他們不是黨政府、我們便要去反對、南京政府是由國民黨創造的政府、我們便不肯去反對、這是說不通的理由、我們只問這個政府好不好、不問他是黨創造的政府不是、愈是黨創造的政府不好、我們黨員愈應該去反對他、今天的分裂、是事實、如果要爲敷衍門面、趕快在十二號開四全會、莫說廣東四百代表不能夠來寗、就六個代表也不輕易進去、必要把政府先行改組、組織起一個大家民衆相信政府、民衆擁護政府、然後我們才可以入南京、所以幾天來雙方不同的意見是如此、我們十二位代表、都是在努力設法去如何求得一個好的方法、雙方政府同意的方法、我們天天討論的也是這一件事、没有什麽不可以告訴大衆的、相信今後解决中國的糾紛、除去用政治方法以外、别無良法、政治不能靠軍事把他解决、軍事解决政治糾紛、只有永遠都存在一個軍力、中國便永遠不會好、自東三省日兵暴行消息發生以後、雙方都不能再用兵、戰事當然無可再生、請各位代表放心、不過我們要怎様去達到糾紛解决、永遠和平的目的、便要有良好的方法、用政治方法、把統一的政府組織起來、統一的政府組織原則、務求民主化、使符合民治原則、按照建國大綱訓政時期的綱領、一步步做去、這個說法、即是在訓政期中、時間方面、民權一天比一天擴張、空間方面、民權一天比一天增加、從一縣地方進而一省、而至全國、今日責任、就在能同心同德、一心一意、去把政府改造成功、這不止黨員人人的仰望、乃是全體國民同様的仰望、但如果說改組政府、一定要在四全會解决的、那就爲難了、記得談起來的國民政府、也是民國十七年由三中全會閉幕之後、由常會决定改組的、由常會决定主席的人選、决定五院院長的人選、怎麽這次又要必定在四全大會去解决呢、現在是國難方殷的時候、必要急切求得統一、各位代表的請求意見如此、我們之覊留在此、委曲求全的、也在如是、好在雙方代表、都能夠竭誠討論、以求達到和平統一的目的、所以和平的前途不是絶無希望的、</p>

<p>各位都是智識界的先生、兄弟是極願意有所請敎的、兄弟是民十八年以來、是一個始終反之南京政府的一個人、南京政府是黨的政府、兄弟反對的意思、就是因爲南京政府一切政治的表現、都是軍政、並非民主政治、如果以爲黨的政府不好、爲黨的面上不去反之他、這便是對黨不起、對主義不起、兄弟是黨員一份子、國民一份子、對黨的政府有什麽不好、不祇黨員應該起而反對、就即國民、也應該起而反對的、十八年以來、國内一天都是打仗、這個政府好不好、希望你們來下一個判斷、如認爲政府不好、要起來反對政府、認爲我們不好、那麽就請你們來打倒我們、如果認我兩方都不好、那麽就請你們把兩方都打倒、一宁要把是非曲直認清楚、然後黨國的糾紛、才有個解决的、和平誰人不願、可是和平不是口說、要有辦法、同時要看各種情和現在境像、剛才聽見沈先生說、際北纳憂外患中、關於我們在上海開會、不入南京、在租界開會、豈不笑話的話、可是我並非吳佩孚、吳佩孚才立誓不入租界、我是用世界革命者辦法來從事革命的、過去已曾經東西南北的漂流亡命、今後也可以馬上到外國、忽然也可以到香港、我是十八年亡命到海外以後、一向都是四面八方地奔走、只要是爲了革命、那裏不可以去、在滿清的時候、我們曾在日本組織同盟會本部、我們並不曾怕人家說我們托庇於帝國主義而不去革命、我更不怕人家拿内憂外患一套話來威嚇我、我們在滿清的時候、也不曾因人家說革命足以召瓜分、就停止革命、兄弟做到革命黨以來、就是向來不怕威嚇的、所以在上海開會不去南京、是不成問題、毫無研究的價値、在上海還可以有自由意志發表的餘地、到南京怎様去救國、怎様去除内憂外患、這層是應該要答復沈先生的、至說到和平會議内容公開的話、一向我們都未有不公開、除了少部份、因外交關係、不便發表之外、其餘每天都在報上看見、外交進行、黨然由南京政府去負責、因爲南京政府經已給國際承認、其除外交方針及原則、則在本會議討論、决定辦法後、交南京政府去實行、說到共赴國難一鄫、當然我們是原本意思、不求共赴困難、我們怎麽要到上海來、可是共赴國難、也要找出個辦法、在廣東的時候、我們對各界民復已經說過、我們祗相去找一條給我們去死的道路、呌廣東出兵去抵抗日本嗎、軍隊能經過南京所統治下的地方嗎、（此段與對學生及工人代表之答詞、大致相同、故略、）所以談到對外的根本辦法、是在樹立眞正民主化的政府、　後方能求得中國永遠的和平、永遠不會内戰、如果民主化的政府不能建立、民主政治、無從實現、則内憂外患、將來恐會比現在更甚、所以像從前北洋軍閥的政府、我們固然要打來、像現在的南京政府、我們也同様表示不滿、因爲不滿意、所以才要求改組、以便眞正實施訓政、樹立民治、然後内憂外患、才可以永遠免除、現在的政軍黨合而爲一的局勢、呌他怎様去能夠免除内憂外患呢、十八年以來、二次的外患、中東路的事件、糊裏糊塗、隨便開仗、隨便又講和、第二次外患、就是現在的東三省事件、試問在現政府下、人民連對外交想說幾句話的自由、都没有、還有什麽法子去對外呢、所以主化的政府不成立、内憂外患、是不能解除的、光是拿内憂外患的話、是不能威嚇我的、兄弟一定要以血去求民主政治的實現、以血去求民主政府的産生、兄弟是革命黨人、老早忘記了生命的存在、但是也許今天說了激烈話、明天又到南京去了、或者還會和蔣介石先生共同作中、但是我是祗求民主化的政府實現、兄弟使在這政府做一個小書記、也是甘願的、自由意志、是天所賦予、不能有伸張自由意志的機會、那就是明天到外國、也是說不定的、關於兄弟的愚見、還請各位智識界的諸先生明察、如各位還有什麽要指敎兄弟的、兄弟是極表歡迎的、（完）</p>

<p>▲中途令停車　當言定租價大洋一元五角、送畢付欵、該行賬房即命第九一零四號開車執照之揚州人汽車夫李世崎開出第一二四九五號新由環球汽車公司購入未及兩旬之克雷斯勒橋式汽車一輛、不速客端坐車中、向西直駛而去、詎車駛過亞爾培路至某司東路相近之益餘坊弄口、不速各忽令停車、</p>
<p>▲汽車夫被紿　車停益餘坊弄口不速客一躍下車、並囑汽車夫相偕入屋、帮同將病人扶下、車夫乃亦下車、同入總弄、折入第一狹弄、由第二後門逕上三樓亭子間、車夫甫入房門、瞥見西首祗有一榻、上覆一舊被、餘無長物、且有赳赳者四人先在、衆人一見車夫、其一忽突出手槍、禁止聲張、雇車之不速客即退出下樓、車夫祗聞引擎一響、蓋汽車已被臨時借用矣、</p>
<p>▲匪一哄而逃　衆人復將汽車夫用繩反縛、以手帕緊紥其口、將其推臥床下、并以紅色毛毯裹之、衆人一齊下樓、祇留一人看守、約過三刻鐘之久、衆人復回、其一出門上之鑰鎖與之、囑車夫不得聲張、並謂少時汽車停在法國花園附近、爾可按址尋之吾等去矣、言畢、一哄而逸、汽車去見杳無一人、掙扎良久、縛始得解、</p>
<p>▲越窗緣梯下　車夫解縛後、推窗外矚、並大聲呼救、詎後門一帶、適有泥水匠搭有高梯、粉飾牆壁、車夫情急、乃越窗延梯而下、再繞至前門、始知爲辣斐德路一二三九號公新協記鮮菒店、仍告該店主人頃間遇險情形、主人尙茫然未知也、車夫亟奔報盧家灣捕房、詎出事地點係屬於善鐘路、遂又雇乘黃包車至善鐘路報告、</p>
<p>▲租屋之經過　捕頭聞訊、立飭中西包探趕往查勘一過、據水菓店主人供名周伯亭、寗波人、該店方於前日開幕、本月四日晚間忽來兩人均操粤音、謂現在某校讀書、租定之樓亭子間、言明每月租金九元、隨付定金二元、至昨晚）即前晚、即將一榻遷入、並稱自六日起租、屆時且有阿兄出爲作保、當晚深夜又來三四人、至於今晨汽車夫在樓上一切情形、因在三樓、距離甚遠、故毫未知悉、</p>
<p>▲果尋獲獲原車　汽車夫會同包探前往查勘後、當即返行、述明當時情形、該行立派多人至法國花園一帶尋車　比至陶爾　　路附近、果見該車停於路旁、後又至捕房報告、捕頭諭令將車先行駛回、候查明再核、但截至夜　本埠華租兩界、並未發生綁刦等案、</p>

<p>The Jiangqiao battle has ceased, and the Heilongjiang army has retreated to Ang'angxi. Rong Kui requests the U.S. State Department to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty. The League of Nations Administrative Council will reconvene in Paris on the 16th regarding the Tao'ang Railway conflict.</p>
<p>The Japanese side demands that Ma's troops withdraw from Heihe.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan supervises the battle on the north bank of the Nen River.</p>
<p>Japanese aircraft drop hundreds of bombs on Daxing.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin telegram: The Japanese consul stated that they are determined to seize Heihe and gave Ma Zhanshan 48 hours to withdraw from Heihe; otherwise, they will attack with aircraft. The Tao'ang Railway has been completely occupied by Japanese troops. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin telegram: The Heilongjiang army and Zhang HaiPeng's troops, under Japanese protection, engaged in fierce artillery fire at Jiangqiao on the 5th. Ma Zhanshan supervised the battle on the north bank of the Nen River. Jiangqiao has not been repaired. Japanese armored vehicles are still on the south bank. Japanese plainclothes troops have been discovered near Heihe. The situation is critical. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin telegram: Honjo ordered the Japanese consul to visit Ma Zhanshan at the Jiang Provincial Government on the evening of the 3rd, demanding that the Heilongjiang army withdraw from Daxing before the 4th to facilitate the repair of the Nen River railway bridge. Ma replied that Daxing was more than 20 li from the Nen River and sternly refused. The Japanese army then assisted Zhang HaiPeng's troops and began a fierce attack. From the morning of the 5th until late at night, the attacks continued without ceasing. Seven Japanese aircraft dropped more than 400 bombs on Daxing. Civilian casualties are unknown. According to semi-official sources, Ang'angxi has not been occupied by the Japanese army, but there are rumors that Japanese troops have entered Qiqihar, which has not yet been confirmed. The Heilongjiang army is currently confronting Zhang HaiPeng's troops at Daxing Station. Zhang's troops and the Japanese army are in the Nen River area. Ma Zhanshan's troops currently have seven regiments of soldiers. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese news agency reports that Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Zhang Xueliang and Wan Fulin, stating that the Japanese army had launched military operations on the Jiangqiao Railway from the 3rd, clearly intending to occupy Heilongjiang Province. His troops have advanced towards Taonan Zhengjiatun according to the planned schedule to protest the Japanese army, etc. According to official sources, the Japanese have long plotted to occupy Heilongjiang Province. Now they are instigating Zhang HaiPeng to rise again, and the Japanese army is also joining forces. Their urgent desire to seize Heilongjiang is obvious. Ma Zhanshan has a duty to defend the territory and cannot but take appropriate defense measures. The Japanese telegram claims that Ma is protesting the Japanese army according to a pre-arranged plan, which is a deliberate attempt to confuse right and wrong, shifting the blame to our side to justify their attack on Heihe and to deceive international opinion by falsely claiming that the conflict was initiated by us. The official side has denied the above-mentioned Japanese telegram. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the latest news, the battle near Daxing on the north bank of the Nen River resumed this morning and stopped in the afternoon. The sound of Heilongjiang artillery has ceased, and they are retreating towards Ang'angxi. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The commander of the Japanese 2nd Division will travel to the Nen River from Changchun today to investigate in person, accompanied by a detachment of Japanese soldiers, to reinforce the Japanese forces at the Nen River. (6th Reuters Dispatch) (Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry seems to believe that the situation in the Nen River is gradually stabilizing. It is said that the Japanese troops have no intention of advancing further into Ang'angxi. Unless there are unexpected developments, the Japanese troops will not change their plan and will withdraw as soon as the bridge is repaired. The Foreign Ministry received a report from the consular office stating that yesterday's conflict was caused by the commander of Daxing disobeying Ma Zhanshan's order to withdraw troops. The withdrawal order was conveyed verbally and was not confirmed in writing. Therefore, when the Japanese troops advanced to protect the bridge repair team, the commander opened fire. Daxing is a military stronghold less than 1,000 kilometers from the river. It is also reported by newspapers in PanYang that the South Manchuria Railway's bridge repair team, escorted by Japanese soldiers, was about to begin work when about 5,000 of Ma Zhanshan's soldiers, with 30 cannons, suddenly attacked. The Japanese soldiers were forced to defend themselves, resulting in the death of 15 Japanese soldiers. It is reported that the Japanese consul in Qiqihar had discussions with the Heilongjiang provincial government regarding the bridge repair, but the Heilongjiang provincial government continued to delay. The South Manchuria Railway, at the request of the Taonan Railway, undertook the repair project to protect Japanese interests because the Taonan line was built with Japanese loans. Ma Zhanshan initially agreed to withdraw troops but finally started fighting at 2 PM on the 4th. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) This afternoon, the Japanese announced that the battle at the Nen River continues today. The Japanese were forced to withdraw after occupying the first line of Chinese defenses. As of 10 AM this morning, 15 Japanese soldiers have died and 40 have been wounded. It is heard that the Japanese expect a large number of reinforcements from Korea tonight. (6th Reuters Dispatch) (Tokyo) According to a Japanese newspaper report from Shenyang, after Ma Zhanshan had discussions with Japanese military leaders, he agreed not to interfere with the repair work on the Nen River bridge. However, when Japanese soldiers advanced toward the bridge, Ma's subordinates suddenly opened fire, causing many casualties. This was after the 4th, and in the subsequent 24 hours, fighting continued intermittently. Japanese aircraft dropped bombs, bombing the Chinese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers were few in number and fought against overwhelming odds. The Chinese soldiers are now plotting to encircle the Japanese soldiers. It is heard that both sides are taking turns attacking. At 3 PM this afternoon, the Japanese soldiers were under considerable pressure and were trying to avoid being surrounded.

<p>(Washington) Today, the Chinese Acting Representative Rong Kui went to the U.S. State Department to verbally request the maintenance of the integrity of the Nine-Power Treaty, stating that the Japanese unauthorized extraction of 670,000 yuan in salt taxes from Yingkou and the previous expulsion of Chinese officials from Shenyang and other places were all violations of the Nine-Power Treaty. The Chinese Embassy also stated that the newly appointed Acting Representative Yan Heling will arrive in Vancouver on Sunday and will immediately go to Washington to inform the State Department of the recent situation in Manchuria. Also today, the Washington Post and the Washington Daily News commented on the battles along the Nen River, saying that they show that Japan intends to permanently occupy Manchuria. The Washington Star commented that the war in Northern Manchuria may drag Soviet Russia into the Sino-Japanese dispute. (5th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Friendly Advice</p>
<p>Content Strictly Confidential</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The U.S. Ambassador here delivered a note to Foreign Minister Shidehara tonight. It is heard that it is friendly advice regarding the Manchurian situation, but both governments have agreed to keep the content of the note confidential. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) After receiving reports of renewed conflicts in Northern Manchuria between China and Japan, the U.S. government issued solemn instructions to its representatives in the East. It is widely believed that these instructions urge the U.S. representatives in Nanjing and Tokyo to earnestly advise against any further actions that would aggravate the situation.

<p>General Shirakawa Returns to Japan</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese General Shirakawa, who went to Jilin and Liaoning for inspection, is scheduled to return to Japan on the 8th. He has already sent the chief of the Second Section of the General Staff, Imamura, back first, carrying Shirakawa's inspection report to visit the Minister of the Army. The main content of the report is that the inspection revealed that the Japanese army is exhausted, which is beyond expectations. If the current troops remain on the front lines, it may not be permissible under the circumstances, and reinforcements and replacement troops should be sent immediately. Based on the report, the Minister of the Army will concretize this after the army maneuvers, which is a major event that deserves attention. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Japanese Authorities Actually Claim it is a Forgery</p>
<p>London The Morning Post this morning revealed a summary of the Tanaka Memorial of July 1927, which explained Japan's aggressive policy toward Manchuria, the ultimate goal of which is to dominate the world. The Morning Post editorial said that these views do not represent the opinion of any responsible Japanese body. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The simultaneous publication of the former Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Memorial by Britain, America, and Soviet Russia has caused considerable consternation here. The authorities have firmly declared the document to be a forgery. Today, the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry was specially ordered to issue a denial, pointing out that the Memorial is clearly fabricated. He said that during the Pacific International Studies Association meeting in Kyoto in 1929, Chinese representatives attempted to distribute this false document. The Japanese government has repeatedly requested the Chinese authorities to stop its distribution.

<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops are still trying to cover the bandit gangs on the Siping-Taonan Railway and attacking Tongliao City and are preventing our 3rd Cavalry Brigade's armored vehicles from reaching Tongliao. If they come, they will open fire. Currently, Zhang's brigade's armored vehicles can only patrol back and forth between Mulitu and Zhangwu County. (6th Dispatch) (Nanjing) According to a telegram from the Beining Railway Bureau to the Ministry of Railways, Japanese troops have been shelling Tongliao for days, occupying the North Station. On the afternoon of the 3rd, Xie Zhen, Deputy Chief of the Mechanical Engineering Section of the Transportation Department, and Buck, the foreign chief of the Dispatching Office, went to Tongliao North Station to negotiate with the commander of the Japanese armored train. He said that because the Siping-Taonan Railway line was broken by bandits, they came to repair it, and he hoped that the transportation on the Siping-Taonan Railway could reach Tongliao North Station. He agreed to contact the Siping-Taonan Railway staff on the morning of the 4th. However, according to Buck's report, when he went to meet on the 4th, there was only the commander of the Japanese armored train, and there were no Siping-Taonan Railway staff. He also disagreed with repairing the Beining Railway tracks near Tongliao North Station and demanded that a document be signed, proving that it was broken by a certain army, which was rejected. Currently, there are no Siping-Taonan Railway staff at Tongliao North Station. The original Beining Railway express trains can still run to the South Station. Efforts will be made to extend them to the North Station after the Siping-Taonan Railway staff arrive at the station and the Siping-Taonan trains can pass. The Japanese army is cunning in dealing with matters. Tongliao North Station was originally a branch line of the Siping-Taonan Railway from Zhengjiatun to Tongliao. Now that the situation is as described above, there is no need for the Beining Railway trains to reach the North Station. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Aggression Is Like Robbery</p>
<p>Urges Government to Take Appropriate Steps</p>
<p>New York Today, the Scripps Howard-affiliated New York World Telegram published an editorial stating that while the International Council is taking a slight break and the U.S. government's attention is focused elsewhere, Japan is disregarding treaties and principles and allowing its troops in Manchuria to advance deeper and deeper. The League of Nations and the U.S. State Department have good intentions but are faltering diplomatically, which is not very appropriate. Today, this situation is becoming increasingly clear. We sincerely hoped that Japan would withdraw its troops, so the League of Nations and the United States did not directly intervene or assist the victimized China, so as not to provoke Japan. Now, that hope is gone. It has been more than a month since the Tokyo government declared that it had begun to withdraw its troops, and it has also been more than ten days since the Council asked Japan to withdraw its troops and announced a recess under the tacit understanding that Japan would voluntarily withdraw its troops without being forced to do so. However, not only have the Japanese troops not withdrawn, but they have expanded their vanguard to more than a hundred miles outside Shenyang, apparently plotting a permanent occupation. The extent of their encroachment not only threatens China but also The fighting on the Taonan Railway stopped yesterday afternoon. The Acting Representative of the United States petitioned the U.S. State Department to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty. The Headquarters was ordered to cancel (see domestic important telegrams). A list of the new British cabinet members was announced (see foreign important telegrams). The Sixth Preparatory Meeting of Representatives from Beijing and Guangdong passed the National Finance Reorganization Committee plan (see local news).</p>

Therefore, today is the time for the League of Nations and the United States to order Japan to choose its path: will it subject the Manchurian case to investigation and resolution by neutral countries, or will it choose to be a robber and isolate itself from the world? It will choose which path to take itself. The fate of Manchuria is not very important from the perspective of the whole world, but it is related to the preservation of world peace</p>

<p>(Moscow) Today, the Russian newspaper Pravda published a very long editorial on the Sino-Japanese Manchurian incident. Pravda is the organ of the Soviet Russian Communist Party, and its view on the Manchurian issue is that it is an effort by imperialists to redistribute the world. Although the newspaper stated that Soviet Russia has no intention of interfering, it declared that the workers of the world should stand up to prevent imperialists from engaging in anti-Soviet propaganda and inciting a new world war. The newspaper claimed that Japan's desire to seize Manchuria is nothing more than to gain hegemony in the Pacific, and in this competition, there are also Britain and the United States, while France is still watching, deeply aware that the Manchurian conflict is the starting point for the redistribution of world territory. Regarding the conflict between Japan and the United States, Pravda stated that the deterioration of relations between the two countries has become an undisguised fact. The biggest reason is Japan's imperial ambitions to establish a vast territory in the Pacific, which not only wants to include Manchuria but also annex the Philippines, the Malay Archipelago, Guam, Samoa, and even annex Australia. For the above statement, the newspaper cited the 1927 memorial of Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka as evidence. The memorial explained why Japan must establish an iron-blooded policy to eliminate all obstacles to Japan's conquest of the Far East. The Tanaka Memorial clearly stated that in this endeavor, Japan will inevitably be at odds with the United States. Therefore, Japan's first war is a war between the United States and Japan. Only by defeating the United States can it control China, and to control China, it must first obtain Manchuria. Therefore, Pravda believes that the recent events in Manchuria are in complete agreement with what was stated in the Tanaka Memorial, indicating that Japan's seizure of Manchuria and Mongolia will not stop there but is just the starting point for establishing a continental government and enslaving the Chinese people. Pravda's view of the League of Nations is also quite unique. The newspaper claimed that the League of Nations is nothing more than an organization to divide China, but the division of China must first involve a war to divide China. The reason why this war has not yet occurred is that the time is not yet ripe. Pravda also made some statements regarding Soviet Russia's own issues. The newspaper stated that since the Manchurian issue arose, the imperialist newspapers have never stopped thinking of dragging Soviet Russia into the vortex, and a major Japanese news agency has continuously spread rumors that the Soviet Russian Federation has expressed sympathy with Japan. However, such fabricated lies are easily disproven because Soviet Russia's policy is to respect international treaties and the independence of other countries. Since Soviet Russia's policy is so righteous, it is better than Japan, which takes advantage of others' misfortunes and seizes their wealth, in distinguishing between good and evil. When one plan of Japan fails, it comes up with another plan. Recently, it fabricated the claim that Soviet Russian troops are assisting the Chinese Heilongjiang military authorities, which is extremely ridiculous, and it is even more strange that people in the United States and France are actually fooled by it.

<p>November 16th is almost over, and the Japanese government not only has not the slightest intention of complying with the League of Nations resolution to begin withdrawing troops, but is even deploying troops westward, attacking Tongliao and the Nen River. Direct conflicts have already occurred. All appeals to justice and peace have been proven to be of no benefit in reality. The 30 million people of the Northeast are under the trampling of a foreign race, eagerly awaiting rescue day and night. With the brutal army advancing westward, various places within the borders will also face serious threats. This has now reached the most serious period in diplomacy.</p>
<p>Today, we will try to ask naive school children what is most important at the moment. Their answer must be "(facing) outward." Ask the farmers in the countryside, and the answer will be the same. "Unite outward." This has become the common will of the people of the whole country. Although even a three-foot-tall child and an ignorant fool know that it is not enough to resist brutality and survive without "(facing) outward." Yesterday, the urgent call of the Shanghai financial community, today, the petitions of the representatives of the industrial and academic communities, and all Shanghai students are said to be sending letters to the peace conference, tearfully urging and advising. The thousand-member Northeast petition delegation will also arrive in Nanjing within days, sorrowfully demanding. As for those who commit suicide by jumping into the sea, go on hunger strikes, and call for help, they are often heard of. The will of the people has firmly coalesced, eagerly awaiting unity and peace to jointly face the national crisis, as if hoping for rain during a drought. Why are the dignitaries still unable to realize this?</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the disaster in the Northeast, the Japanese government and public have been dealing with this issue with all their strength. Various circles have held "Manchurian Situation Discussion Meetings." Various publications also focus on the discussion of this issue. The other side is coming to invade, and the government and the people are paying attention without the slightest relaxation. We are the victims, the disaster is imminent, but our authorities are still disputing internally and refuse to look outward. This is the most lamentable and painful thing in the world. What exactly is the purpose of the disputes between Beijing and Guangdong today? If it lies in "national consensus" and "unity and peace," then "unite outward" is the most important of national consensus. However, if both sides have this initial intention, then all disputes can be negotiated and compromised. Why do they each cling to their own opinions, making peace negotiations increasingly bleak? If this is the case, we believe that the leaders on both sides should not forget that they are "comrades in the party" and "compatriots in the country." The people are still the same, the country is still the same, and the Three People's Principles are still the same. What cannot be unified and peaceful is the leaders themselves. The sorrow of frying beans from the same root comes from internal strife while external enemies advance. Throughout history there are records and regrets that last forever. We truly do not understand why the leaders on both sides seem unaware and oblivious, but still cannot let go of their disputes</p>
<p>Today, without the country, there is no party, and even less of the leaders themselves. If the nation is destroyed, there will be no Beijing and Guangdong. When the country is no longer a country, how can there be selfish views? Therefore, only by uniting outward can we solve the internal disputes, and only by uniting outward can we save the crisis. If we quibble over internal issues, contend over momentary gains or losses in power and prestige, then the future of the country and the nation will be unspeakable and unbearable.</p>
<p>We earnestly hope that the leaders on both sides will shift their inward gaze and turn it outward, and shift their spirit of internal strife to resisting foreign aggression. We even more earnestly hope that the leaders on both sides will leave a lifeline for the Chinese nation and not allow the national pulse and people's lives to be severed because of their own actions. If Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the afterlife has the awareness of what is happening, we dare to assert that what he hopes and expects from both sides is nothing more than this.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Second&lt;</p>
<h3 id="e16">Shi Zhaoji Reports the Nenjiang War to the League of Nations <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Please Ask Briand to Stop Japan's Challenge; Administrative Council Likely to Meet in Paris</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 5th, Shi Zhaoji sent a reply to Geneva, stating that Japan was extremely provocative, attempting to use airplanes and allied local troops to encircle the Chinese army and force it into battle. He requested that the Chairman of the Executive Yuan be notified immediately to intervene, and that Japan should bear full responsibility for causing serious disputes through this provocation. The appendix to the note stated that several hundred Japanese soldiers, carrying twelve airplanes and many field guns, had crossed the Nenjiang Bridge, launching a fierce attack that killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the chief Chinese representative, visited League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, urging him to pay close attention to the Nenjiang War and to convey this fact to the Chairman of the Administrative Council, Briand, requesting that he find a way to stop the conflict in Tokyo. The Japanese delegation notified the Secretary-General of the Japanese version of events, stating that the conflict arose from repairing the Nenjiang Bridge. They claimed that the bridge was destroyed half a month ago during fighting between Zhang Haipeng's and Ma Zhanshan's troops. After the local authorities applied to repair it, a Japanese advisor and several Chinese officials were present at the site, but they were bombarded by machine guns and artillery. The Tao'an Railway Bureau then decided to carry out the bridge repair with the assistance of Japanese troops. The Japanese troops would maintain strict neutrality between the opposing Chinese forces, but would take defensive measures if there were any actions hindering their work. They also stated that the Japanese troops would withdraw as soon as the bridge was repaired. When Dr. Shi, the Chinese representative, met with the Secretary-General, he left a note stating that Japanese troops were actively provoking incidents near the Nenjiang Bridge. According to a telegram from the Nanjing government, Japanese soldiers disguised themselves in Chinese clothing, led bandits, and bombarded Chinese troop camps on October 4th. Multiple Japanese airplanes dropped bombs, killing more than twenty Chinese. On November 10th, six hundred Japanese soldiers crossed the Nenjiang River and attacked the Chinese, killing over a hundred. He requested that the Chairman of the Administrative Council be immediately notified to negotiate with the Japanese government to stop the Japanese troops' provocative activities. Dr. Shi did not request an immediate convening of the League of Nations Administrative Council, but it is widely expected that Briand will consider it necessary to convene a meeting before the 16th. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council, originally scheduled to reconvene on November 16th to discuss the Manchurian situation, will be relocated to Paris. Chairman Briand notified the Secretary-General today, advocating for a meeting of the Administrative Council to be held in Paris on November 16th. Secretary-General Drummond is currently consulting with other members of the Administrative Council regarding this proposal, which is expected to be approved without objection, as many members are already in Paris, such as Briand, Fang Ze, and the representatives of Panama and Guatemala. There is currently no issue of advancing the meeting date. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) With Japanese troops attacking Chinese forces along the Nenjiang River and the Chinese army responding, the League of Nations today may be said to have received a request to mediate a real war for the first time in its history. In the past, requests for mediation from other countries were usually related to small border conflicts, but this time, there has already been fierce fighting and many casualties on both sides. Although China's appeal is still based on Article 11 of the Covenant, those in the Council and Secretariat believe that the situation has reached a point where further action is unavoidable. It is anticipated that China will have two possible courses of action: one is to continue the appeal under Article 15 of the Covenant, which authorizes the Council to impose sanctions without waiting for unanimous agreement, and the other is to request the Council to convene an early meeting. It is possible that Chief Chinese Representative Shi will pursue both avenues simultaneously. Today, Dr. Shi reported to the Council that Japanese troops are concentrated near Qiqihar and along the Tao'an Railway, threatening the peace and order of the entire northern Manchuria. Japanese military authorities are aiding the rebel general Zhang Haipeng in attacking the legitimate government of Heilongjiang Province led by General Ma Zhanshan. Japanese Lieutenant Hayashi informed the Heilongjiang provincial government that Japan is determined to change the political situation in Heilongjiang by force, regardless of the actions of the League of Nations. Therefore, Japanese troops are actively provoking incidents at the Jiangqiao Bridge and have already occupied the Daxing Station on the border of Heilongjiang Province. Japanese soldiers, disguised in Chinese clothing, led bandits with airplanes to attack the Chinese army at the Nenjiang Bridge. In the first attack alone, they killed twenty Chinese officers and soldiers. Currently, six trains of Japanese soldiers have arrived at the Nenjiang Bridge, with the apparent intention of aiding the rebel general Zhang Haipeng in attacking Heilongjiang Province. At this time, Japanese soldiers, with their airplanes, are leading bandits to provoke the Chinese army in an encirclement, forcing them to fight. Although the Japanese troops sent to the Jiangqiao Bridge are nominally there to restore transportation on the Tao'an Railway, in reality, it is to cover Zhang Haipeng's rebel army, enabling them to attack the capital of Heilongjiang Province. Although Japan denies that its troops have advanced north of the Nenjiang Bridge, when viewed in conjunction with the aforementioned facts, their purpose is clearly evident. As for the area south of Heilongjiang Province, in addition to occupying the Tongliao railway station, they have also sent five airplanes to circle over Jinzhou. Their airplanes and armored trains frequently appear and operate in remote areas. (5th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>Ling Bandit Forces Advance on Jinzhou</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Shenyang received by foreigners, Ling Yinqing organized an independent army, recruiting in various villages, claiming to be resisting Japan. However, the villagers, knowing that he was under the command of the Japanese army, were mostly not deceived. The Japanese military authorities, hearing about this, feared that his strength would become sufficient and that he would turn against Japan. Therefore, they disarmed his army of over ten thousand men stationed somewhere west of the Liao River. Consequently, Ling is in a difficult situation, unable to advance or retreat. Ling, despite his difficult situation, sacrificed his remaining troops and incorporated scattered bandit units, advancing along the Beining Railway towards Jinzhou in an attempt to achieve his aims. Therefore, the situation along the Beining Railway has become tense in recent days. (6th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e63">List of New British Cabinet Members <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Expanded from Ten to Twenty Members</p>
<p>Concentrating Talent and Allocating Positions</p>
<p>Prime Minister MacDonald Also Manages the Exchequer</p>
<p>Chancellor Chamberlain Most Forceful on Tax Rates</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon Renowned for His Legal Scholarship</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 6th. The list of cabinet members approved by the British Emperor was announced this morning as follows: Prime Minister and Exchequer MacDonald (National Labour Party), President of the Privy Council Baldwin (Conservative Party), Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain (Conservative Party), Lord Chancellor Sankey (National Labour Party), Foreign Secretary Simon (National Liberal Party), Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas (National Labour Party), Colonial Secretary Lister (Conservative Party), Home Secretary Samuel (Liberal Party), Secretary of State for India Hoare (Conservative Party), President of the Board of Trade Runciman (National Liberal Party), Secretary of State for War Hailsham (Conservative Party), First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell (Conservative Party), Secretary of State for Air Londonderry (Conservative Party), Secretary of State for Scotland Sinclair (National Liberal Party), Minister of Health Young (Conservative Party), Lord Privy Seal Snowden (National Labour Party), President of the Board of Education Maclean (National Liberal Party), Minister of Agriculture Gilmour (Conservative Party), Minister of Labour Betterton (Conservative Party), First Commissioner of Works Gore (Conservative Party).</p>
<p>The National Cabinet has been expanded from ten to twenty members, restoring the old system. Among them, the Conservative Party occupies eleven seats, the Liberal Party five, and the National Labour Party four. The cabinet members of the previous session who have not been reappointed include Foreign Secretary Reading, because Reading had stated when he took office that he could only serve for a short time. Neville Chamberlain's long tenure as Chancellor of the Exchequer can be seen as a clear indication of the government's attitude on the tariff issue. However, Runciman's tenure as President of the Board of Trade can also be seen as a sign that the government does not want to actively pursue tariff policies. Neville Chamberlain has strongly advocated for tax rates, while Runciman is a strong supporter of free trade. However, Runciman has also recently stated that the import of luxury goods can be restricted. Former Conservative cabinet member Amery, who is an extreme advocate of tax rates, has not joined the new cabinet this time. In fact, extreme protectionists do not occupy a position now. British Prime Minister MacDonald was very careful about the selection of new cabinet members, wanting to obtain a true national government that conforms to the mandate of the national election. The organization of the cabinet is based on this standard, so the distribution of positions does not match the number of members of each party in the House of Commons. The four seats in the cabinet belong to the National Labour Party, which is not based on the National Labour Party's one-fifth share of seats in the House of Commons. The edict of Snowden's peerage will be issued soon. The new Foreign Secretary, Sir John Simon, the former chairman of the Indian Constitutional Reform Commission, is one of the most capable members of Parliament, renowned for his legal scholarship. His appointment as Foreign Secretary is very appropriate. Many complex issues such as reparations and war debts will await his handling. President of the Board of Trade Runciman is a giant in the British shipping industry and has a great understanding of finance and economics. His appointment as President of the Board of Trade is a cause for celebration, as he is a good fit for the position. Hailsham, the Conservative Party leader, is taking office for the first time after eight years. Upon seeing this list, all newspapers praised it as the best cabinet, because it brings together talents from all parties into one cabinet.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Garoli Besieged on All Sides</p>
<p>Financial Reorganization May Be Hopeless for the Time Being</p>
<p>▲National News, Budapest, 5th. Political turmoil in Hungary has been brewing for a long time, and there have been rumors of cabinet instability. Today, Hungarian Socialist Party leader Rákosi renewed his request to impeach Prime Minister Garoli, causing an unprecedented riot in the parliament. The immediate cause was the Prime Minister's speech on restoring the country's economic situation. From the moment Garoli took the stage, Socialist Party members were restless and noisy, making Garoli's remarks almost indistinguishable. Some even shouted that Garoli was a deceiver or a traitor. The Speaker stood up to prohibit this, but the crowd did not listen, and the conflict intensified. The Socialist Party members then stood on their chairs and declared that the country was bankrupt, and that the government was trying to deceive the people with a plan for the aftermath, which was tantamount to deception. The Socialist Party leader then proposed to impeach Prime Minister Garoli and the entire cabinet, with the subject being that the current cabinet had destroyed public trust. However, at this time, the situation in the parliament was so chaotic that it was soon adjourned. Rumors are rampant outside, and it is feared that national finances will be hopeless to reorganize for the time being. Furthermore, the chaos in this parliament may make the Pan-European faction's determination to seize power even stronger.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, London, 5th. Gandhi was given an audience by the British Emperor today, having accepted the Emperor's invitation to participate in a tea party with other representatives of the Indian Round Table Conference. Gandhi still wore a homespun dhoti, a loincloth, and a large shawl on his shoulders, to Buckingham Palace. There was a crowd waiting outside the palace. Gandhi sat in a closed large car. He was barely seen when it passed by, but when the car entered the palace gate, he happened to be glimpsed by a guard, who saluted him. Gandhi responded with a smile. Gandhi, along with Dibinhain Jati, ascended the stairs and shook hands with the Emperor and Empress. Afterwards, the guests rested in the famous painting gallery. The Emperor and Empress also mingled among them, chatting casually. It is reported that Gandhi has not met with the Emperor for thirty years. In the past, when the Emperor, then Duke of York, was in South Africa, Gandhi represented the Indians of that city to present congratulations.</p>

<p>▲National News, Rome, 5th. Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov will arrive here from Istanbul, Turkey tomorrow to consult with Italian Foreign Minister Grandi. The purpose of the consultation is not yet known. However, it is known that the Russian Foreign Commissar, who went to Turkey this time to revise the Russian-Turkish treaty, is willing to briefly explain the process to the Italian government. Furthermore, Italy recently concluded a treaty with Romania to purchase a large amount of wheat, which the Soviet Russian diplomatic authorities are quite dissatisfied with, because Soviet Russia is currently ordering a large amount of goods in Italy, and Italy should give priority to purchasing from Soviet Russia if it needs food. Therefore, Litvinov's visit to Italy this time is bound to protest against this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Another Instigating Trick by the Japanese <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>▲Yazaki and Others Attempt to Entice Northeast Military Officers</p>
<p>North China Correspondence: The Advanced Military Studies Research Class of the Northeast Military Academy was established in February of the 17th year of the Republic of China and the first class of students, totaling about 50 people, graduated in March of the 19th year and were assigned to various brigades for apprenticeships. In January of this year, the second class of students also graduated and were assigned to various brigades, following the example of the first class. Some of them have already taken positions such as staff officers. When the class was opened, in order to pre-store staff talents, it was necessary to have the enlightenment and guidance of those proficient in the strategy and tactics of the army, navy, and air force. Three Japanese instructors, Urasumi E, Suda Tadashi, and Yazaki Kanju, were hired to take on the role. Therefore, the Japanese instructors have a teacher-student relationship with the general students. However, since the Shenyang Incident, the instructors have all entered the Kwantung Army Headquarters to take up positions. Because the students of the class are scattered in various brigades of the Northeast Army, they even thought of instigating the students to betray the army, revolt and return to Shenyang, and cooperate with the Japanese army, stationed in the area around Dahu Mountain. Zhang Tingchu, the staff officers of the Liu and Gao regiments, were students in the class. Yesterday, they received two letters of incitement from Suda Tadashi and Yazaki Kanju. The content of the letters was absurd and unreasonable. The regiment reported it to the Border Defense Commander's Office for investigation and prohibition. The original text of the letters is extracted below to show that the Japanese are doing everything they can to instigate and divide our three eastern provinces.</p>
<p>▲Letter 1: Greetings. We have now driven out the warlords and political bandits with accumulated crimes in the three eastern provinces. The rest are all good people, so we want to build a peaceful world for these good people. If you can discern the current situation, abandon those great evils and warlords, and join the good people in building an ideal and peaceful kingdom, you will be practicing the true way of loving the country and protecting the people, which is what protectors of the country should do, and can be believed to be the only way forward. If you only aggravate the crimes of the warlords, what difference is there between you and a national traitor? We do not want you to support the crimes of the warlords and act as their accomplices, but wish that you would plan for your future happiness. Therefore, we dare to offer you our advice. If you believe it, return to your hometown as soon as possible and work hard with your fellow villagers to build a new world of paradise. We are extremely anxious and look forward to it. We wish you all the best. From Suda Tadashi and Yazaki Kanju, instructors of the Advanced Military Studies Research Class, respectfully to Staff Officer Liu Ziton and Staff Officer Gao Fanwu.</p>
<p>▲Letter 2: Greetings. It is deeply regrettable that an incident has unfortunately broken out between China and Japan this time. However, the Japanese people, for the sake of 70 million people, are striving for the peaceful development of Manchuria and Mongolia, which we believe you fully understand. Cooperation with your country in the peaceful development of the Chinese nation is the most important thing for the peace of East Asia and the happiness of the people of China and Japan. However, the sovereigns of the warlords of your country and some people around them have prevented Japan's legitimate hopes and have planned and organized anti-Japanese and insulting activities, using inhumane means to prevent the peaceful development of Japan's 70 million people and lead them to death. They even dared to carry out violent acts to destroy the South Manchuria Railway, which led the Japanese military to punish the military power holders in order to ensure the lifeblood of the South Manchuria Railway. Now, the old warlords and old regimes of the three northeastern provinces have all been destroyed. The rest are good people. Now, we are implementing good policies in the four northeastern provinces and building a truly peaceful ideal country, wanting to live a life of mutual happiness and welfare, which is worthy of confidence. Therefore, there are now newly formed troops. You have received advanced military education, have a thorough understanding of the world situation, and are all talented people who can seize the opportunity. Therefore, we hope that you will return to your hometown as soon as possible and build a peaceful environment, and leave the old warlords who are about to collapse, and strive for the formation of this new army and the construction of peace. If you return, it will not only be your happiness, but also the happiness of world peace. We are anxiously waiting to hear from you. We wish you all the best and hope that you will convey this meaning to your classmates and take action quickly. Yazaki Kanju, instructor of the Advanced Military Studies Research Class, 26 Inaba-cho, Fengtian Japanese Station.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Japanese Military Monitors Xi Qia <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>▲Exhausting All Efforts But Failing to Please</p>
<p>▲Anyone with a Conscience Should Know to Repent</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the establishment of the puppet government of Jilin, finances have been extremely strained. The reserves in the provincial treasury had already been robbed clean by the Japanese. The operating expenses of various agencies must be scraped together with great effort from the districts under the control of Soehito and the Japanese military. Still, a large amount of military pay must be provided to the Japanese military every month. If they are slightly dissatisfied, the Japanese will summon them for reprimands. Xi Qia is quite embarrassed by this, so he requested Japanese Commander Honjo to use the protection of the Japanese army to send personnel to take over the tax collection agencies in important towns such as Changchun and Harbin. If there are any difficulties, the Japanese military will provide armed support. The Japanese agreed. Therefore, Xi Qia appointed Sun Qichang to manage the Yalu River Lumber Company and manage logging in the Yalu River area. He appointed Wei Zonglian as the Director of the Jilin-Heilongjiang Salt Transport Bureau, took over the Changchun Salt Transport Tax Bureau, and imprisoned the former director. The above-mentioned agencies are all the main sources of revenue for the Northeast. Xi Qia sacrificed his life to seize them for the Japanese. Yesterday, Xi issued an order to the various agencies, the text of which is recorded below: "In accordance with the fact that the Provincial Governor's Office of this province has been temporarily organized and established, all organizational outlines and the date of my appointment as Governor have been circulated in the past. This time, the incident occurred suddenly. I was acting as the head of both military and civil affairs, and I did not dare to act rashly and mislead the area, nor did I want to delay and sit idly by, watching the disaster. Since I had received the order of non-resistance, I immediately convened emergency meetings with military, political, and local groups, deciding that the troops in the provincial capital would be moved to the suburbs to avoid conflict, so that the merchants and residents were fortunate enough to be safe when the Japanese troops entered the city. Later, compelled by the situation, I temporarily organized the Governor's Office in order to unite the province and await future resolution. I feel that my virtue is thin and I dare to take on difficult tasks. However, the local people are attached to me with great righteousness, and temporarily no one is responsible, so I had to take on the task reluctantly. The circumstances are not of my own volition, and I hope that you will all understand. The leaders of various agencies, the county magistrates of various counties, and the directors of various tax bureaus have all worked together for many years. At this time of upheaval, they should prioritize the local people, be respectful of their duties, and work together to overcome difficulties. This is what I hope." After this order was issued, Ren Dafeng, the head of the Jilin Provincial Tax Bureau, obeyed Xi's order and sent Jin Yaoting (formerly an investigator at the Harbin Stamp Tax Office) to Harbin to take over the Binjiang Stamp Tax Office. A few days before, the Binjiang Stamp Tax Office had received an order from the Jilin Governor's Office, instructing it to remit the tax revenue to the provincial capital. The office did not respond. On the 26th, Jin Yaoting, the newly appointed officer, and his assistant Zhang Qian, sent Han Yuming and Xia Zhihan to see Li Changyin, the duty officer at the Stamp Tax Office, holding two official documents from Jilin, urging Li to expedite the handover. Li replied that the office was an agency under the Jilin Provincial Government and only knew how to follow the orders of the old provincial government. Chairman Zhang Jiang issued a telegram strictly forbidding compliance with the orders of the Jilin puppet government. He could not disobey Chairman Zhang's telegram and betray the puppet provincial government. He stated that Mr. Jin, the so-called new duty officer, had not received an order from Chairman Zhang to come here, and that he had no need to discuss anything with him. Seeing that Li's attitude was very resolute, Han and the others fled with the official documents. Because Jin Yaoting was Li's subordinate, after Han left, Li immediately sent someone to look for Jin. However, Jin, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, took a car and fled to Jilin. After investigating the situation, it was found that he had embezzled more than 200 Harbin silver dollars. The office is handling the matter in accordance with the usual procedures for public officials who embezzle funds and flee. On the one hand, they are reporting the circumstances of Jilin's sending personnel to take over the Stamp Tax Office to the Deputy Commander's Headquarters in Beiping, and on the other hand, they are issuing a telegram to inform all agencies and legal entities in the city of the true nature of Jilin's sending personnel to take over the Binjiang Stamp Tax Office this time. Furthermore, Xi Qia is now aware that the League of Nations has decided to order Japan to withdraw its troops, and Jilin's small empire has been confirmed to be a dream. He is deeply afraid that if the Japanese army withdraws, his personal position will not be guaranteed, and even his life may be in danger. Therefore, he secretly sent someone to Beiping to explain to Zhang Zuoxiang that his taking office and reorganizing the provincial government were all due to Japanese coercion, and that he had no such ambition. The matter was heard by the Japanese, who expressed great dissatisfaction. In addition to severely scolding Xi Qia, they also cancelled Xi's South Mansion and set up a large number of police officers at Xi's residence for surveillance. Xi's every move is being closely monitored. Anyone entering to meet with Xi must be inspected by the Japanese military. Official documents and even Xi's personal private letters must also be inspected. At this time, Xi Qia is truly in a situation where he cannot please anyone. (October 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e74">The So-Called Pending Issues of the Japanese Are Like This (Continued) <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>39. Forcibly Laying the Railway Through the Sakakibara Farm. In the 14th year of the Taisho era (1925), China obtained Sakakibara's promise regarding commercial leases and began laying the railway across the Beiling Farm, across the Choujingning Line, and to Huangtun, connecting to the Aviation Institute. At that time, the Fengtian Consulate General requested a method for paying rent for the use of the land. China claimed that the commercial lease contract was invalid. On June 27th of the 4th year of the Showa era (1929), Sakakibara was forced to remove the railway tracks by force. The farm had been formally recognized by the Chinese authorities for a commercial lease contract in the name of Sakakibara's younger brother, Uramoto Seizaburo, on May 6th of the 8th year of the Taisho era (1919).</p>
<p>40. Oppressing Japanese Residents in Fengtian City. Fengtian was opened to foreign residence and trade based on the 1903 Sino-American Commercial Treaty. Chinese officials in Fengtian set up a commercial port area outside Fengtian City and used this as a limit, forbidding foreigners from residing and doing business. They stubbornly insisted on their improper claim, ignoring repeated protests from Japan and related countries. They used methods of persecution against Japanese residents in the city to force them to leave. As a result, only 44 households remain in the city recently.</p>
<p>41. Oppressing Japanese Residents in Sanxing City. Sanxing City in Jilin Province was opened based on the Manchuria Treaty Accessory Book in the 28th year of the Meiji era (1895). Chinese officials made the same improper claim as in Fengtian and directly and indirectly oppressed Japanese residents in Sanxing City, making it difficult for them to live and do business. Currently, only five or six households remain. It is absolutely impossible for new residents and businesses to enter.</p>
<p>42. Oppressing Japanese Telephones in Fengtian City. Based on the Sino-Japanese Telegraph Agreement of the 41st year of the Meiji era (1908), Japan has reserved the right to operate telephones between the South Manchuria Railway Attached Land in Fengtian and Fengtian City. Two years ago, Chinese officials came to discuss the revision of urban areas in Fengtian Province and requested the relocation of telephone poles, changing the wires to lead-covered wires and reducing the number of telephone poles. Construction in the city was completed at the end of last year. By August of this year, the Fengtian Telecommunications Administration used some minor technical excuses to obstruct the connection work in the commercial port area, greatly hindering Japanese operations.</p>
<p>43. The Statute for Punishing Traitors to the Nation. (A) In the 4th year of the Taisho era (1915), the Fengtian Provincial Government, disregarding the treaties of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, enacted a provisional statute for punishing traitors to the nation in July of the 4th year of the Showa era (1929) with the aim of harming the commercial lease rights of Japanese people engaged in commerce, industry, and agriculture in South Manchuria. They secretly ordered local officials to strictly prohibit foreigners from mortgaging or leasing land. Those who violated the statute would be sentenced to death or life imprisonment and fines.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Excerpts from Important News <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Gold, June of the 6th year of the Showa Era. After several revisions, the right regulations were changed to "Punishment Rules for Illegal Sale of National Land", trampling on the most important rights of Japanese people under the treaty. As a result of the promulgation of the right regulations, the aforementioned treaty became a dead letter. Not only is it impossible to obtain commercial lease rights in the future, but also the vested rights before the promulgation of this rule are gradually being taken back. For example, in March of the 4th year of the Showa Era, the Dongya Industrial Company of Mentai Village, Panyang County, leased 24 mu of land from a Chinese person, Li Yunfei, for 10,000 yuan. The Liaoning Provincial Government, by a decision of the committee, sentenced the right landlord to death under threat. In January of the 5th year of the Showa Era, the Dongya Industrial Company rescued the life of the landlord in question by acquiring the land title related to the case. This is a fact. As a result of the promulgation of the right illegal decree, in the past one or two years: 1. The county magistrate of Xinmin County sold land in Qigongtai in the county to Japanese people and imprisoned the landlords. 2. In Liuhe County, because a Chinese person, Zhao Shuhuan, leased land to Dongya Industrial Company, his land was confiscated and the Japanese manager was expelled (Dongshan Farm issue). 3. In Benxi County, a landlord was imprisoned and attempts were made to confiscate the coal mine on the grounds that a Chinese person leased a coal mountain to a Japanese person. 4. In Ji'an County, a Chinese person rented a house to a Japanese police station, and the head of the household was imprisoned. 5. Liaoning Province, regarding the scattered rice paddy management by Koreans in various places, followed the usual practice of dismissing existing lease agreements and cultivation contracts, and adopted a policy of converting them into simple employment contracts. Examples are too numerous to mention. (B) Jilin Province, like Fengtian Province, issued a "Prohibition Order on the Illegal Sale of National Land", disregarding the land ownership of Koreans based on the Gando Convention. Moreover, in various places in Jilin Province, Koreans are not only unable to buy land, but their cultivation contract terms are also subject to interference.</p>
<p>44. Obstructing Korean Residence and Farming: Recently, Chinese authorities in various parts of Manchuria have directly and indirectly suppressed the residence and farming of Koreans. In addition to the aforementioned obstruction of land lease cultivation contracts, new regulations have been issued to expel immigrants, prohibit renting of houses, hinder business operations, and force Chinese landlords and heads of households to not only order Koreans to vacate, but also use force in some cases. For example, 1. In June of this year, Jilin provincial authorities attempted to expel Koreans in Wanbaoshan and improperly interfered with the cultivation contracts between landlords and Koreans. 2. In July of the same year, Jilin Province, under the pretext of suppressing communists in Taolaizhao, expelled many innocent Korean farmers who had recently immigrated there. 3. Around August of the same year, in Tongliao, Chinese authorities exploited a civil dispute over the so-called misdiagnosis issue between a Korean doctor and a patient's family, forcibly prohibiting the doctor's business and forcibly evicting him. All such instances are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>45. Illegal Arrests and Punishments of Koreans: Recently, Chinese authorities in the three northeastern provinces have disregarded treaties and arbitrarily arrested and imprisoned Koreans in Manchuria, mostly without any judicial procedures, sentencing them to imprisonment for several months or even more than a year. There are still more than 60 people in this category in the Fengtian Prison, about 40 in Dunhua, more than 130 in Jilin, and about 40 in Harbin.</p>
<p>46. Denying the Japanese Extraterritoriality Judgments of the Jilin Provincial Court: According to the judgment text of the Jilin Provincial Court on a secret accusation against a certain Korean, it is recognized that he has Japanese nationality. However, since the trade treaty with Japan has expired and is invalid, Japanese people do not have extraterritorial rights and must abide by the judgments of Chinese courts.</p>
<p>47. Failure to Comply with the Gando Convention: The Gando Convention stipulates that Koreans have the right to own land. However, China secretly issued a secret order prohibiting the illegal sale of national land, prohibiting Koreans from obtaining land ownership. In addition, Koreans have the freedom to export rice, but China secretly prevents this. The Koreans in Gando are greatly hit economically because they are not allowed to sell rice to the Korean peninsula across the border (the price of rice in Gando is about half the price of that in Korea). Furthermore, the Gando Convention stipulates that the Japanese consul must be notified regarding the lives of Koreans when they are defendants, but this is not implemented (see the previous item on the Ji-Hui line).</p>
<p>48. The Spread of Anti-Japanese Teaching Materials: In recent years, the Chinese government has incorporated many anti-Japanese materials into textbooks for national general education, cultivating a vengeful sentiment towards Japan among young citizens, which violates international faith and is a major event that goes against the fundamental meaning of Sino-Japanese friendship.</p>
<p>49. Anti-Japanese Propaganda by the Northeast Culture Society: The society is an organ of the Fengtian authorities and often broadcasts anti-Japanese content. The most notable example is the natural fire in the Dashan coal mine in Fushun in February of this year (called an explosion, but not to that extent), where no one died, but it was propagated that pit workers had died in the explosion. Japan protested but it was not cancelled.</p>
<p>50. Anti-Japanese Movement by the Liaoning National Diplomacy Association: The Liaoning National Diplomacy Association was organized in June of the 4th year of the Showa Era with anti-Japanese activities as its main purpose. Recently, it has been publishing its official magazine, holding daily gatherings, and using newspapers to vigorously spread malicious propaganda against Japan, leading to extreme deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>51. Oppression of the "Shengjing Times": The "Shengjing Times", a Chinese-character newspaper operated by Japanese in Fengtian, is the most authoritative media outlet in Manchuria, enjoying high credibility at home and abroad. However, in cases where its fair editorials are unfavorable to the Fengtian authorities, official power is abused to oppress it. There are many such instances. A recent notable example is the thorough obstruction of its distribution for about ten months from the 2nd to the 3rd year of the Showa Era, preventing delivery and making its business virtually impossible, causing enormous damage. Oppression continued thereafter, as was the case from June to August last year. Furthermore, from July to August of this year, the director of the Fengtian Public Security Bureau secretly colluded with the Liaoning National Diplomacy Association to arrest and imprison the newspaper's powerful vendors in Fengtian at the Public Security Bureau, subjecting them to indirect and despicable persecution.</p>
<p>52. Discriminatory Treatment in Issuing Domestic Travel Permits: Around October of last year, the Fengtian and Liaoyuan negotiators, aiming to prohibit Japanese people from traveling to areas west of Taonan and areas north of Jilin Province, and recently also in Huludao, which is competing with Dalian, restrictions were placed on Japanese travel. Compared with those of other foreigners, Japanese passports are subject to discriminatory treatment with restrictive endorsements. Japan has repeatedly protested, but not only has there been no reflection, but recently instructions have also been issued to negotiators in Tieling, Liaoyang, Andong, Yingkou, Tonghua, Hailong, etc., to impose restrictions similar to those in Fengtian and Liaoyuan.</p>
<p>53. Obstructing the Tongliao Farm: Regarding the farm operated by Dongya Industrial Company in Tongliao, when constructing flood control dikes this spring, the county Public Security Bureau, accompanied by a large number of police officers, set fire to the coolie huts and drove away the coolies working there.</p>
<p>54. The Nakamura Captain Incident: Captain Nakamura led Isugi Entaro and a Mongolian and a Russian on a trip to the Xing'an reclamation area. On July 26th of this year, they were ambushed and captured by the 3rd Regiment of the Soviet-Outer Mongolian Border Government stationed troops and all were killed. The facts are extremely clear. The Japanese side has repeatedly engaged in strong negotiations, but the Fengtian authorities initially denied the facts. When denial became impossible, they used various excuses to try to evade responsibility. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Two Telegrams from Feng Yong <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>▲ Telegram Urging Peace Talks: To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Hu Hanmin, Mr. Sun Ke, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, and Mr. Li Shizeng in Shanghai, The national crisis is increasingly urgent, the actions of the Japanese army are expanding, and the credibility of the League of Nations is precarious. The moment of survival or demise will be decided within ten days. We must devote all our efforts to it, hoping to achieve something. Discussions on the system of the party and the state do not seem difficult to resolve by abandoning past grievances. Political disputes easily lead to military conflicts, and internal strife is worse than external attacks. Betraying oneself is often done unconsciously. In the current situation, one must either be Goujian who tasted gall or Tian Heng who jumped into the sea. Both require the same goal of unity. The common people are deeply moved by Goujian's unremitting efforts to strengthen the country. Why not disregard the sword and laugh while offering one's head to atone for one's mistakes? However, this must not be what you all allow. We urge you to eliminate emotional disputes and complete the peace talks as soon as possible, and strive to implement revolutionary diplomacy, support the people's movement, and unite the whole country. Then, the fact that the Germans recovered the Rhineland occupation twelve years after the war is enough to encourage us to endure Shanghai and strive for self-improvement. Looking south to the Yangtze River, I urgently express my words, hoping you will consider them. Feng Yong, bowing down.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Awaken the People: To all organizations, legal entities, newspapers, and people from all walks of life, after the Northeast Incident, Feng Yong managed to survive and enter the customs to face the elders of Guanzhong, feeling deeply ashamed. However, as a military scholar, I have nothing to do with major plans and was imprisoned by enemies. Turning around in a small room, life and death were uncertain. Finally, I was put on a ship to seek exile in a distant wilderness. The turbulent waves overwhelmed me, and my body and mind were lost. By falsely relying on the elders, I was able to cross the sea after hardships and set foot on the national soil again. Meditating and thinking about the pain, I cannot remain silent. As the saying goes, "One must insult oneself before others insult one." and "One must attack oneself before others attack one." In the past twenty years, the atrocities committed by Japan and other imperialists against our people have been almost incessant. The accumulated weakness of the country is certainly a clear reason. However, if during this period, people had worked together to build the country, without military conflicts to damage the country's strength and without political disputes to lose the people's hearts, ten years of recovery and ten years of education, even if we could not conquer Wu, how could Wu conquer us? This is the first thing I cannot remain silent about. In today's world, economic competition precedes military affairs. We claim to be a country established on agriculture, but the value of food imports exceeds 200 million yuan annually. As for exporting raw materials and importing finished products, we have become a market for international exploitation and plunder. It is difficult to count those who sacrifice their flesh and blood as sacrifices. Even if Japan does not engage in military aggression, its detailed and concrete understanding of our country's economic situation, which is transformed into policy and applied as a neighbor, could it not uniquely control our fate? Those who extravagantly talk about military matters today, although they may have some insights, have they ever had precise scientific plans for national production development and distribution? How can China's agriculture gradually move towards industrialization, and how can we save the country through industry, all are still dreams. If we want to build, we will only sigh that we have the will but not the power, and we will be even more ignorant. This is the second thing I cannot remain silent about. The rise of a nation, in addition to strength, values accurate consciousness. Today, the entire country is accustomed to comfort, extravagance, and licentiousness, without end. The sounds of crying from hunger and cold are not heard, and the tragedy of overturned nests and destroyed homes is ignored. Some are warlords, some are politicians, some are corrupt officials, and some are greedy officials. They claim to overthrow, but they themselves embody these ills. Many students boast of being promising youths, but they mostly squander their parents' money and act out farces to obtain diplomas. They regard pleasure and indulgence as legitimate lifestyles, boasting of neglecting their studies as being superior and shouting insults to teachers as being great. They indulge in romance and have long become parasites of society. Whenever national humiliation occurs, they also run around and shout slogans, but they have their own intentions and separately conceived plans. It is impossible to find even five percent of pure and passionate blood, let alone working on the ground and leading the people for a long time. In recent days, military training is loudly advocated, but can the youth truly maintain this serious spirit, live in groups, and cultivate the habit of discipline? If there is doubt about this, then waking up and walking in sleep is enough to be secretly laughed at by the enemy. If consciousness is improper, then the aim will be inaccurate. This time, the Japanese people's tyranny should be seen not as attacking our weaknesses in action, but rather as attacking our weaknesses in consciousness. The ancients said that the greatest sorrow is the death of the heart, and physical death is secondary. Have the hearts of the people of the country died? This is the third thing I cannot remain silent about. In summary, these three points all stem from insulting and attacking ourselves, which is due to our own ignorance. I hope that all the elders, brothers, sisters, and aunts in the country will resolutely break through the barrier of self-deception and become the government's support and the government's supervisors. Then, a nation can be revitalized through difficulties, which can be used as an admonition. Feng Yong, with the remaining years of his life spent in worry and committed to the country, is willing to take up the whip and rush to the battlefield for the sake of the people. I hastily express my words, feeling deeply anxious. Feng Yong, bowing down.</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Depression of Japanese Commerce in Qingdao <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲ Our Economic Sanctions are Gradually Showing Results</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since all sectors of this city have consistently implemented economic sanctions against Japan, Japanese industrial and commercial businesses in Qingdao have suddenly shown a state of depression. Some small industrial and commercial businesses have even closed down as a result. The recent business conditions of Japanese industrial and commercial businesses are investigated separately as follows: (1) Spinning Mills: Although the major spinning mills founded by Japanese people in Sifang, Cangkou, and other places are still continuing to operate, there are no sales of their products in Qingdao at all. Even those shipped to other ports are only 20 to 30 percent, and the rest are piled up in warehouses. Although there is no problem with funding for the time being, the public warehouses are full and cannot accommodate any more. Most are barely holding on. (2) Cotton yarn, cloth, sugar, paper, and miscellaneous goods are all in a state of complete shutdown. No one is making new purchases, and even agreed-upon goods cannot be delivered. Also, there are no orders for marine products, and there are even cases of returning the remaining balance of already delivered goods. (3) Exported goods: There are currently no shipments. (4) Banks and shipping companies: Their business has been greatly affected by the negative resistance. Also, because Chinese banks and pawnshops refuse to pay pawn tickets and refuse to sell silver dollars, business has become sluggish. The Japanese-Qingdao shipping company has stopped scheduled sailings due to a sharp decline in cargo and passengers. (5) Various factories: Unlike spinning mills, many of their employees have become idle, and many cannot maintain operations due to funding issues. Among them, many small industries that were recently established, such as printing, ironware, and miscellaneous goods, have temporarily closed down. (6) Small merchants who specialize in serving Chinese people have completely stopped operating. Observing from the above situation, if our country can persevere to the end and cut off all transactions, then Japanese industrial and commercial businesses will have no foothold in Qingdao.

<p>Principal Zhong Xiu still not safe: Since the Flying Cloud steamer of the Tongyuan Yiji Steamer Bureau on the Dongshan Inner River was hijacked, several hostages have been released one after another. However, Ms. Chuan Zhongde, the principal of Zhongxiu Primary School in Dongshan, is still being held in the bandit's lair. Ms. Fu's family circumstances are very poor, and she has been studying since childhood and has been subsidized by the Women's Relief Society to be able to serve the community today. Although she is a primary school principal, her monthly income is only more than 30 yuan, which is only enough to make ends meet. This time she was kidnapped, not only is she financially unable to find a way to rescue her, but her old mother has just died and there is no one else. Therefore, the bandits regard her as a god of wealth, but she is actually a poor female teacher without a place to stand.</p>

<p>The High Court investigates the opium case: On May 3 of this year, the Wuyi County Court sent bailiff Liu Shiqin to Xixiasu in the third district to investigate the opium dealer's office, Wang Chengji, resulting in the bailiff Liu being beaten by the crowd. The opium dealer Wang Chengji and his wife Wang Yinshi took the opportunity to escape. The bailiff reported to the court and verified the injuries. Chen Baoxin, the police officer of the first police station of the public security second sub-bureau of the town, failed to assist the court in arresting the suspect in advance, and was suspected of dereliction of duty. The Public Security Bureau immediately ordered him to be suspended from his duties. Afterwards, Wang Shuliang, the director of the Benniu Public Security Bureau, learned that the opium dealer's wife Wang Yinshi and his partner Yun Jusheng and others had sneaked back, and immediately sent police officer Wang Zheng to lead the police to arrest them for interrogation. Many people were implicated. Wang Chengji also turned himself in. After the prosecutor completed the investigation, he prosecuted the criminal court and sentenced Wang Chengji, Wang Yinshi, Yun Jusheng, etc. to imprisonment and fines. Yesterday (the 5th), news came that the chief prosecutor of the High Court paid close attention to this case. Because the police officer Chen Baoxin of the town police station was suspected of protecting the opium dealer Wang Chengji and dereliction of duty, he was impeached according to law, ordering the Wuxian Local Court to try the case according to law. The court specifically scheduled to open the court on the 7th of this month, summoned Liu Shiqin, the bailiff of the Wuyi County Court, Li Zonggang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Baoxin, the police officer, and Xie Ling, the chief of the third district. All the summons have been sent to the Wuyi County Court, ordering the police to serve them according to law, ordering all the summoned to come to Suzhou for trial on schedule.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association organizes ten-person groups: The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association believes that the country is in extreme danger recently, and that there is no way to survive without self-salvation. Without unity, there is no way to save oneself. Therefore, it has launched the organization of anti-Japanese national salvation ten-person groups. Ten people are a group, based on the relationship of occupation, neighborhood, friends, and relatives, vowing to resist Japan and save the country, revitalize the nation, engage in training in life and thought, and strive to carry out the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. Yesterday, it had drafted organizational rules, creeds, and oaths, asking all sectors to organize quickly.</p>
<p>More than 20 groups pray for peace and unity: The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, the Zhenjiang County Farmers' Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, the Journalists' Association, and more than 20 other groups sent a telegram to Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Hu Hanmin, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, and two other gentlemen in Shanghai yesterday, and forwarded it to all representatives, roughly stating that since the completion of the Northern Expedition by the National Revolutionary Army, the people thought that they could enter a period of prosperity. However, for several years, there have been frequent internal conflicts and external aggression, especially by the Japanese bandits. They destroyed our Jinan and now have destroyed our Northeast. The national crisis is urgent, and the country will be destroyed soon. Fortunately, all parties have abandoned their differences to seek sincere unity to jointly face the national crisis. The people are all celebrating with joy. The party can truly save the country and make the last attempt to govern the country by the party. However, in the past ten days, several preparatory meetings have been held, but political opinions have become increasingly divergent, and there is unrest in the city. The people are weeping and begging, willing to starve to death, fearing that the Republic of China will be destroyed. The association and others deeply know that the meetings held by both the Beijing and Guangdong parties this time are to save the nation from danger. They also know that you must be able to see the people's expectations today, shorten the meeting preparations, take national affairs as the premise, and take the political program and policies as the basis to establish a national salvation strategy to rescue the people from the fire and water. If there are people who dare to take risks, or pretend to cooperate, or speak arbitrarily, and even try to obstruct and destroy, the righteousness will be revealed, and the will of the people will be there. The association and others swear to lead all the people of Jiangsu Province with the determination to support peace and unity, and to work together. At the same time, we also dare to use the determination to wish the peace conference to break through all difficulties and achieve a satisfactory result. We anxiously express our words and are overwhelmed by the anticipation.</p>

<p>Stores That Suspended Business Resume Normal Operations: The silk fabric, general merchandise, and sundry goods stores in Huaiyin have, since the 28th of last month, all suspended business under the pretext of inconvenient financial turnover. As of yesterday (the 2nd), it has been five days and they have not yet reopened. The local Anti-Japanese Association happened to be in a period of reorganization. Yesterday, Dai Boqiu, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, and the original mediators Ye Zijun and Gu Xunru, went to the county government to discuss solutions with County Magistrate He and Qian Danquan, a standing committee member of the Party Department. The result was that since the merchants said they suspended business due to financial inactivity, the Japanese goods that should have been sealed up by the merchants who suspended business could be used as collateral for the various money houses. Each merchant could justify their actions, and there would be no need for sealing even after the establishment of the new anti-Japanese association in the future. Everyone considered this method to be appropriate for a time. At 4 PM the same afternoon, the Chamber of Commerce summoned the directors of various industries for a tea party. The merchants of various industries, who only sought profit, also considered these methods to be satisfactory and agreed to resume business as usual today (the 2nd). By about 7 AM this morning, the 18 stores that had suspended business indeed reopened their doors, and the storm of strikes came to a temporary end.</p>

<p>A Major Incident in the Inspection of Japanese Goods: Some crew members and sailors of the Xin Jiang Tian Wheel recently harbored deep resentment because they secretly carried Japanese goods and were repeatedly discovered by anti-Japanese inspectors. Yesterday morning, the ship arrived in Yong from Shanghai, loaded with 240 packages of foreign salmon dried fish, rumored to be Eastern Ocean dried fish, purchased by 11 fish shops in Yongbu, including Hengtai and Tongfuchang. The sailors wanted to test the inspectors' eyesight and responsibilities, so they first took five or six dried fish ashore. As a result of the test, the inspectors detained them. Later, when the whole case of dried fish was taken ashore, the inspection team did not detain it for some reason. Therefore, the sailors, using the slogan that the inspection team was being influenced by treacherous merchants, gathered five or six hundred crew members and hooligans and made things difficult for inspectors Xu Zhen and Li Henian. They dragged them to the Ning Shao Wharf, beat them severely, and tied them to the pier, claiming they should be paraded through the streets. For a time, many people echoed this. The two chiefs of the police station and the supervisors of the Public Security Bureau tried to persuade them without success. The police went to mediate, but many were beaten. Order was greatly disrupted for a time. Later, after Chen County Magistrate, Mao, Chief of Public Security, and Lin, a member of the Party Committee, persuaded them in many ways, Xu and Li were finally released and taken to the Public Security Bureau for further investigation into the source of the dried fish for verification. Unexpectedly, Zhuang, a patrol officer from the Second District Office, planned to escort Xu and Li to the Public Security Bureau. When they reached the entrance of Hejia Lane, they were intercepted and severely beaten by the sailors. The two took the opportunity to escape into the China Merchants Bureau and closed the iron gate. The crowd smashed the signboard of the bureau. It was not until a company of security guards arrived that order was slightly restored. As a result, Xu and Li were escorted from the China Merchants Bureau to the Public Security Bureau, and the 240 pieces of dried fish were sealed by the Chamber of Commerce in the China Merchants Bureau's warehouse.</p>

<p>▲Central Government to Issue Firearms</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Boling, Director of the Shanghai Student Volunteer Army Training Office of the Training Supervision Department, was originally scheduled to hold an inauguration ceremony at the Jiangwan Labor University today, as reported in the previous days' newspapers. It is now learned that Mr. Wang decided to hold it at 9 AM tomorrow due to insufficient preparation. The location is still in the auditorium of Labor University. All party, government, and military agencies have been widely invited to attend the ceremony. It is also heard that the central government plans to send Zhang Yuejun to administer the oath.</p>
<p>▲Wang Boling's Talk: Wen Guangyi, director of the Military Training Department of the Shanghai University Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation, accompanied by Gu Bu Guanghua, instructor Chen Yinzhangde of the department, visited Wang Boling, the central government's specially appointed director of the Shanghai Youth Volunteer Army Training Office, at the Municipal Government yesterday. The Shanghai News Agency learned the following from their conversation: (1) When will firearms be issued? Wang answered: "The central government sent me here to train the student army, so of course they must give me tools (referring to firearms). The central government is very sincere in training the Shanghai student army, and I also have great enthusiasm and hope. I believe that in the near future, the central government will issue firearms. If the central government does not issue them, you enthusiastic students will ask the central government for them, and I will also ask the central government for them." (2) When will instructors arrive? Wang answered, "Today (the 6th), the central government has sent more than 140 people to Shanghai, who can be assigned to various schools around tomorrow." (3) Regarding the training outline, has the central government ordered various departments to draft it and is it now complete? Wang answered, "The central government's training outline has not yet been issued. After the training outline is issued, I will formulate detailed training rules based on the situation in Shanghai, within the scope that does not violate the principles of the central government." At this point, the representatives of the Student Federation invited Wang to participate in the district inspection organized by the association, which Wang praised.</p>

<h3 id="e94">After the General Association of Chinese Students Studying in Japan Moved to Shanghai <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>▲Compatriots Within the United Nations Vow to Resist Japan to the Death</p>
<p>▲Dispatch Personnel to Organize Branches to Increase Strength</p>
<p>▲The Issue of Transferring Schools Is Still Difficult to Resolve Temporarily</p>
<p>▲Please All Sectors to Assist Detained Students</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The General Association of Chinese Students Studying in Japan moved to Shanghai on the 29th of last month, renting the Huadong Apartment on Malong Road as its headquarters. It began working on the 4th of this month, striving for the anti-Japanese movement. Yesterday afternoon, the association held a meeting with reporters from various newspapers and news agencies on the third floor of the YMCA on the side of Jincheng Education Bank to report on the situation of the association's move to Shanghai. The Shanghai News Agency reporter recorded the following reports:</p>
<p>▲Reasons for Returning to China: There are four main points: (1) Excessive oppression by the Japanese police; (2) Must fulfill the duties of the representatives' congress of each school; the purpose of our 3,000 students is because the environment in Japan is harsh and unfavorable for progress; (3) To promote peaceful unification and jointly resist foreign enemies; (4) To cooperate with the revolutionary masses in the country to resist Japan together until death.</p>
<p>▲Reasons for Invasion: The main reasons for the violent Japanese invasion of our Eastern Provinces are: (1) Domestic economic panic leading to political panic; (2) From a semi-colonial status to a purely colonial status; (3) Intending to obtain a base for the Second World War.</p>
<p>▲Anti-Japanese Work: (1) Make efforts in anti-Japanese work that students in domestic universities cannot reach; (2) Promote peaceful unification to produce a strong government to resist Japan together; (3) Go to the countryside; (4) Will never return to Japan for studies before the violent Japanese troops withdraw.</p>
<p>▲Publish Publications: It has been decided to publish the "Exposure" tri-weekly, which has already been printed, and organize a research association, divided into five departments: political, economic, diplomatic, social, and military. The research findings of each department will be published in another magazine for the reference of the people of the country.</p>
<p>▲Organize Branches: Representatives have been sent to Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places to be responsible for organizing branches to carry out a unified anti-Japanese movement and increase strength.</p>
<p>▲Unwilling to Register: More than 200 returning students have registered in the branch associations, more than 120 have registered in the Municipal Education Bureau, and more than 1,700 have not registered. The total number of returnees is about 2,000 or more, accounting for four-fifths of the total number of students studying in Japan. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued instructions, ordering students who have already registered with the Municipal Education Bureau to transfer to Nanjing Central University, the local Jinan University, the engineering department of Jiaotong University, and Jiangxi Agricultural College as auditors. However, the returning students are unwilling to transfer schools. Yesterday, Qin Yuanbang, the general affairs director of the association, visited Lin Ben, the representative sent by the Ministry of Education, and stated the reasons as follows: (1) Unwilling to disperse students, reduce anti-Japanese strength, and hinder the national salvation movement; (2) If registered, they must transfer to domestic universities, and their student status in Japan will be cancelled in an invisible way; (3) After registration and receiving a considerable living allowance, they must transfer to various schools; (4) Due to the fact that their facts and level of study cannot be transferred to domestic universities as auditors.</p>
<p>▲Request for Assistance: Wen Yongzhi, a member of the executive committee of the association, was arrested by the French police at the association's office in Huadong Apartment at 9 PM the night before (the 5th), and documents and books were searched, and the office was sealed off. Wen Xiangping, a member of the standing committee of the association, was also arrested at No. 30, Xiafei Lane, Xiafei Road, at 1 AM on the same night. Luo Jianbing (female), the accountant of the branch association, and Lei Zhensheng (female), a member, were also arrested at No. 15, Yide Lane, Lafayette Road, at 12 AM on the same night. In addition to investigating the truth, the association sent a representative, Mou Yu, to the Xujiawan French Police Station at 2 AM yesterday (the 6th) to negotiate, but to no avail. Then they went to the local court to request notification to the French police authorities to allow them to meet the arrested students. The reply was that it was not within their scope of responsibility and it was inconvenient to forward the request. The association believes that the members are all patriotic people who returned from Japan and are actively working hard for the anti-Japanese national salvation work, and their studies have been sacrificed. However, the violent Japanese have still not withdrawn their troops and continue to invade, so the anti-Japanese work must be stepped up. The members have been arrested and urgently need assistance from all parties to request their release. It has been decided to separately request powerful assistance from the representatives of Ning and Guangdong, the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Administration, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Taxpayers' Association, the Municipal Anti-Japanese Association, and other agencies this morning. The anti-Japanese groups of various universities have already been working hard for this and ask all parties to act as a backing for negotiations, it is said.</p>

<p>▲The President Enthusiastically Provides Assistance</p>
<p>Since the expansion of the organization of the anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Second Branch of the Cultural Institute in Shanghai, it has intensified its work and spared no effort.

It is responsible for the active workers of the department director Jin Xihan and the propaganda team is reorganized by the department and the entire school is divided into 38 teams. A second expanded promotion of international activities has been carried out. Shen Jiugao, Pan Wenhua and other gentlemen have been hired and will issue a book to the people of all countries within days. (2) In terms of military training, the military uniforms have not been prepared in time, but all students in the school are willing to join the military as a whole. The school sent a team of plainclothes soldiers to participate in the inspection of the Volunteer Army in the first district of the Student Federation yesterday. It has also been heard that in order to step up training, the association has requested the school to expand the playground, and the president has agreed to train in the large playground in the near future. Li Peitian, the president of the school, is particularly enthusiastic in his support. After the volunteer army initiated the organization, he immediately allocated funds to subsidize each person with ten yuan, which is indeed an initiative of the Shanghai school.</p>

<p>丨Over 3,000 Attendees丨</p>
<p>The second relief boxing match was held last night at 9:00 PM at the same venue. The evening featured a gathering of famous professionals. Westerners accounted for nineteen out of ten attendees. Director Zhang of the Nanjing National Arts Hall delegated Zhu Guofu and Weng Guoxun to attend and observe. The program consisted of eight events. The important matches were in the first half, featuring Shanghai's leader Ross against India's champion Tao Kefu, and in the second half, Clayton against Maurice, lasting until 12:45 AM.</p>
<p>(1) Thomas (Suffolk), 130 lbs, vs. Cooley (Shanghai), 131 lbs - Thomas wins.</p>
<p>(Course) The fight was scheduled for four rounds. Thomas defeated his opponent about halfway through the second round, ending the match.</p>
<p>(2) Shi Weili (Mailing), 135 lbs, vs. Niger (Shanghai), 138 lbs - Shi wins.</p>
<p>(Course) Initially, Niger attacked fiercely but did not gain an advantage due to poor defense. Later, Shi Weili rallied and gained a superior position. At the end of the sixth round, the referee declared Shi the winner.</p>
<p>(3) Peito, Hudson, 128 lbs, vs. Bauer (Luoshan), 132 lbs - Peito wins by two pounds - Peito wins.</p>
<p>(Course) A match between the US and French naval champions. One was Peito, the leader of the US fleet, and the other was Bauer, the French naval champion. The Frenchman defended tightly and struck powerfully. The American did not attack recklessly but landed many blows. In the first four rounds, both had their ups and downs. In the fifth and sixth rounds, the Frenchman attacked more than he defended. At the end of the round, the referee declared the American the winner. The audience was dissatisfied, and boos arose. In all fairness, a draw would have been the most equitable outcome.</p>
<p>(4) Ross (Shanghai), 170 lbs, vs. Tao Kefu (Hong Kong), 80 lbs - Ross wins.</p>
<p>(Course) This was the highlight of the first half. The two initially maintained a stalemate. From the fourth round onwards, Shanghai's Ross landed several powerful blows, gradually gaining the upper hand. In the fifth round, Tao was punched in the face and fell to the ground, unable to continue. The bell saved him. In the sixth round, Tao woke up and attempted to strike horizontally. In the seventh round, Ross was resilient and punched powerfully. In the eighth round, Ross maintained his advantage and secured the final victory.</p>
<p>(5) Bernie (Hudson), 128 lbs, vs. Bena (Manila), 138 lbs - Bernie wins.</p>
<p>(Course) The two were evenly matched. In the third round, Bena lost his defense and was knocked to the ground. He repeatedly called out ten times but remained motionless on the ground. Bernie won. Bernie was the first to win by knocking out his opponent.</p>
<p>(6) Walker (Western Police), 150 lbs, vs. Qin Ning (Mailing), 155 lbs - Qin Ning wins.</p>
<p>(Course) In the first two rounds, Walker had a slight advantage. The third round was a draw. In the next three rounds, Qin Ning showed strength, and the final victory went to Qin Ning.</p>
<p>(7) Dulin (Hudson), 158 lbs, vs. Baron (Suffolk), 153 lbs - Dulin wins.</p>
<p>(Course) In the second round, Baron fell to the ground three times but continued to fight fiercely. In the third round, Dulin landed many blows again. The fourth and fifth rounds were evenly matched. In the sixth round, Baron's face was unprotected and he was repeatedly hit, ultimately leading to his defeat.</p>
<p>(8) Clayton (Western Police), 147 lbs, vs. Maurice (Suffolk), 147 lbs - Clayton wins.</p>
<p>(Course) The first round was even. In the second round, Clayton was initially forced to the ropes, but then Clayton rallied. In the third round, both sides fought chaotically, with no clear advantage. In the fourth round, Maurice showed better strength. In the fifth and sixth rounds, Clayton hit the enemy in the face, but he also took several blows himself. In the seventh round, Clayton was better. In the eighth round, Clayton again gained the upper hand, ultimately triumphing.</p>

<p>The Voice of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The brutal Japanese call our three northeastern provinces "Manchukuo," and even have so-called "South Manchuria" and "North Manchuria." This is because they have long harbored intentions of aggression and have established terms with anesthetic effects. We should rightfully call them the "Three Northeastern Provinces" or the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and should not echo them. However, newspapers and magazines still use "South Manchuria" and "North Manchuria," as if tacitly acknowledging these nonsensical terms. How can this be?</p>
<p>Recently, someone suggested changing the name "Japan" to "Bandit State" to make the name fit the reality. I strongly agree with this proposal. Like Japan, which is so fierce, cruel, and unscrupulous, committing all kinds of evil, disregarding justice, and lacking humanity, its actions are nothing short of a "Bandit State." If my colleagues in the press agree that this is not wrong, please change the name "Japan" to "Bandit State" from now on.</p>

<p>A very enlightened boss of the new era said to one of his part-time employees:</p>
<p>"It's time. You should go to class."</p>
<p>The employee, who was loyal to the store, looked at the clock and then at the boss and said, "I want to take a day off today. The classmates all say that I am too enthusiastic in class, as if I am supporting the teacher."</p>
<p>The boss was surprised by this unexpected answer. He didn't say anything at the time. Later, he met a friend who understood the inside story of education and talked about this matter. That friend thought for a moment and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Taking fewer classes can save some money on transportation and buy more books to read, which is much better than listening to professors' lectures. Your colleague is more accurate in calculating this."</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Plundering of Treasures from My Palace by the Japanese寇 in the Year of Gengzi <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The Japanese寇 have repeatedly invaded China, as recorded in history books. In the year of Gengzi, the Boxer Rebellion occurred. The Eight-Nation Alliance trampled our land. The imperial gardens were burned. The emperor fled in disgrace. It was a major upheaval in the Qing Dynasty. When the Eight-Nation Alliance marched straight in, the Japanese slaves acted as the vanguard and were in charge of the gatekeepers. My friend Zhang Lianweng, who was a resident of Beijing, knew an old palace eunuch named Jia. Jia witnessed the events of that year firsthand. He said that the Japanese slaves were more greedy and ruthless than any other country in looting the palace. They seized many treasures from the forbidden area. According to what I (Jia) know, there was a jade bottle. The bottle was twelve feet tall and purely emerald green. In the summer, when placed in a room, it would naturally generate coolness within five or six feet. It was like King Zhao of Yan's summer-cooling beads. Empress Dowager Cixi loved it very much. The Japanese slaves hurriedly plundered it. Carelessly carrying it, it fell to the ground and broke in the middle. The broken bottle was still carried to the Eastern Island by the Japanese slaves. The eunuchs picked up the small, uncollected pieces left on the ground. Later, antique dealers sold them to Western countries for more than 100,000 gold, which shows the value of the bottle. There was also a crystal horse, as large as an ordinary riding horse. The whole body was crystal clear. The palace maids often straddled it after a bath to play. The lingering fragrance of the beauties was immeasurably precious. Also, there was an ivory mat used by Emperor Yongzheng. Thin slices of ivory were shaved and woven into a dragon-patterned mat. The fineness of the workmanship was like the work of ghosts. It is said that it took half a year, day and night, to weave this mat. After it was completed, the person who made it lost his eyesight due to excessive consumption of eyesight. The power and blessing of the autocratic emperor can also be seen from this. Other coral trees were made, with gold dust used as mud, and bright moon-like beads were carved from white jade into boxes. The Japanese slaves took whatever they wanted, not knowing how much they carried away. The essence of the imperial palace was almost completely lost. It is extremely heartbreaking to talk about. This time, during the Shenyang Incident, the Northeast was rich in storage and plundered at will. What is even more regrettable is the Siku Quanshu. The value of cultural relics cannot be compared with jade and silk. Looking north, my grief is endless.</p>

It involves cutting out a piece of wood like a slice of watermelon. Then, no matter what the situation in the water, it can immediately return to its original state. Recently, another amazing invention was announced to the world. It is indeed a ship that will not sink. The inventor is a Frenchman named Joseph Dharttain. He made a model of an Atlantic mail ship, twelve feet long and half a ton in weight, for shipbuilding experts to test. They used iron bars to poke many large holes in the hull below the waterline. If a large ship were poked with these holes in the same way, it would undoubtedly sink to the bottom of the sea in one or two minutes. But this model ship, even with holes all over it, only dropped one or two inches and still floated proudly on the surface of the water. If such ships were to become popular all over the world, it would truly be a blessing for sailors.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Commercial Press branch window recently displayed maps of the Three Northeastern Provinces and statistical charts of China's area and population, and comparison charts of the US and China's economy and education. Catering to the current situation, it attracted the attention of many passers-by.</p>
<p>Recently, beggars resembling disaster victims have been seen sporadically in the evenings.</p>
<p>One day, a policeman kicked a white-haired old beggar sitting at the entrance of Doule'an Road. The beggar staggered away in pain. Passers-by looked on.</p>
<p>Japanese Marine Corps sentries still patrol day and night. Five people form a team.</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder. Every morning, many working-class people sit and bask in the sun along the western side of the road.</p>
<p>North of Dadelie, there are many Jiangnan peddlers selling hot water caltrops in the mornings.</p>
<p>The Cantonese Grand Theater is currently performing non-Cantonese plays.</p>
<p>There are about twenty stalls selling crabs.</p>
<p>Many Japanese and Chinese female students are seen on the road when going to and from school. They all wear uniforms. However, Chinese female students seem to pay great attention to the decoration of their hair, shoes and socks.</p>
<p>The students of Japanese schools here are simple and unadorned. I have never seen anyone wearing "high-end Western clothes" or long hair with slanted ointment. Some of the Chinese students have the demeanor of young masters. Those who see it sigh.</p>
<p>Every night after 8:00 PM, there are still White Russian volunteers wearing iron helmets and full armor. Every six or seven people form a small team, followed by several Chinese and Western Indian Japanese patrol officers. The White Russian volunteers march and stand in formation. The other patrol officers walk casually in scattered teams.</p>
<h3 id="e110">A Record of a Beauty Treatment Demonstration <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Nvpu</p>
<p>In my spare time after class, I was sitting alone and bored. I read a novel advertisement in the newspaper from Sincere Company. For a moment, I was moved by the attraction and curiosity, so I drove to see it.</p>
<p>The beauty salon is located on the second floor. Although it is not large, it is beautifully decorated and contains artistic ideas. The four walls are hung with portraits of Hollywood movie stars after using Max Factor beauty products. They are full of dazzling things and are beautiful to see. The stage is set in the center of the room. Steel chairs are arranged in front. There are many Chinese and Western women among the guests. The staff cordially greeted them and seated them in order. The demonstrator is a Western woman, who is the so-called Mrs. Xishi. She gave a speech in English about the efficacy of Max Factor beauty treatments. A gentleman from the company translated. After the speech, she asked one of the guests to try it first. The audience all held their cheeks in their hands and shrank back. Suddenly, a person next to the seat stood up and responded, "Okay." Looking at her, it was a middle-aged woman of about forty years old. The translator led her to the stage and asked her to sit down. The demonstrator observed her for a long time. (The color of each person's face is different, so the powder used is also different.) She applied cleansing cream to her face and gently wiped it off with a powder brush. Then she mixed and applied rouge evenly. Next, she gently swept the eye area with eyeliner. She drew eyebrows that resembled a crescent moon. She thinly applied lipstick on her lips. She used white powder to apply it to all parts of her arms. After it was finished, she was graceful and beautiful as peach and plum blossoms. What was previously called a middle-aged woman is now transformed into a graceful lady. The omnipotence of science is truly not a false statement. Returning home, I was moved and wrote it down.</p>

<h3 id="e111">A Countryman Comes to Shanghai Again (9) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>"Why has the value of Zhu Mao risen like this?" He wanted to elicit the countryman's words, so he pretended to ask for advice.</p>
<p>"Probably because of the customs duties on going abroad," the countryman nodded and shook his head, constantly sucking on his dry cigarette holder.</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right!" The detective thought to himself secretly. "I once heard people say that many Communists have been abroad. Zhu Mao is also a student who has studied abroad and has been to the West. Now he says that their value has increased because of going abroad, which is even more correct. Who would have thought that such a countryman is a Communist?"</p>
<p>"Does going abroad increase value?" The detective asked faintly.</p>
<p>"How can it increase value?" The countryman again made his great remarks. "In this day and age, everything must be contaminated with foreign air. Instead of speaking Chinese, you have to speak foreign languages. Instead of wearing Chinese clothes, you have to wear Western-style clothes. Instead of wanting a Chinese wife, you have to marry a foreign woman. In fact, don't we have everything in China? Bringing a little foreign air is considered fashionable." After giving this theory of pacifying the inside and resisting the outside, his eyes were still fixed on the young man in a suit who was reading the newspaper opposite, as if he still had some lingering anger over the dispute over the erotic picture book.</p>
<p>"Why did the value of Zhu Mao increase because he had been abroad?" The detective pressed on. This was like a hunting dog seeing a rabbit, how could he let it go easily?</p>
<p>"This is easy to understand. That pig hair is used for fertilizer and cannot escape the hands of us farmers. Besides fertilizing the fields, it has no other use. So those butchers who kill pigs have to buy it from us. Now I hear that that kind of thing is also foreign. Foreigners have come up with new tricks. Besides fertilizing the fields, it has other uses. What exactly is it used for? He secretly concealed it, but once they bought it, the pig hair soared. It used to be a few dollars a load, but now it has risen to tens of dollars a load."</p>
<p>"What a few dollars a load? Tens of dollars a load? I'm asking you about Zhu Mao."</p>
<p>"That's right! I'm telling you the price of pig hair."</p>
<p>"I'm asking you about the Communist Party's Zhu Mao."</p>
<p>"I'm telling you about the pig hair for fertilizing the fields."</p>
<p>"Bah! It's really confusing." The detective was greatly disappointed. He wanted to take this opportunity to get a great credit and win a great reward. He didn't want the Zhu Mao in our hearts to turn into the pig hair in his heart. He was fooled by this country old man. He was so angry that he still lay down and slept, pretending to be asleep, listening to what the third-class guests had to say.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Gold Prices Plummet <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>▲A Miserable Drop of 26 Taels</p>
<p>▲The Atmosphere Deteriorates, Bulls Painfully Cut Losses. Yesterday, the 6th, the gold market continued to experience a significant upheaval with violently falling prices that were impossible to predict. The market changes were extremely difficult to manage, with fluctuations of over ten taels occurring frequently. Including both the morning and afternoon sessions, there was a total of twenty taels of backtracking. As a result, the price miserably dropped by over twenty-six taels. The market was chaotic, with supply and demand fluctuating greatly. The rise in silver prices, the increase in foreign buyers, and the increasingly fierce aggression of the Japanese all caused extreme panic. Gold prices opened low, and both exchange rates within and outside the country declined, with hanging positions increasing by as much as four levels. Afterwards, prices fluctuated unpredictably, hovering around 640 taels. In the afternoon, a storm of falling prices, deterioration of the atmosphere, and a shortage of exchange rates occurred. Sellers on the counter acted boldly, and the price suddenly broke below 630 taels, reaching a new low of 26 taels. Most bulls looked worried, and were forced to painfully cut losses.</p>
<p>▲Large Bars Opened High and Immediately Crashed. From an opening of 646 taels in the morning, the price immediately fell by 9.5 taels. Large bars surged by 11/16. Silver prices rose by 1.5 cents, and the European market was quite firm. The price then rose slightly by 2 taels, to 48 taels. In an instant, buying increased sharply, rising violently by over 14 taels, to only 34 taels. Moments later, Wanxing, Shunli, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, and others bought in, and Maccari absorbed English gold at 10.5 pence, again raising the price by 7 taels, to 41 taels. However, people's hearts were ultimately disheartened, and it was known in advance that the hanging position would increase by more than one penny. As expected at 9:30, it increased, and the US dollar also added 1.5 yuan, causing the price to fall to 35 taels. Later, finally, Changyong, Tianfengyong, Qianchangxiang, Yifeng, Dalianbangyong, Yifeng, and others competed to enter, and it was heard that banks had slightly settled accounts, and the industry was scrambling to settle. The English gold was reduced from 10.5 pence to 10.25 pence, and the US dollar was only calculated at 34.8125 yuan. After the banks absorbed it at 34.875 yuan, it was 45.5-46 taels around 10 o'clock. Suddenly, it was heard that India was selling English gold electronically, and foreign firms and Guangbang were also selling, almost causing the exchange market to be easily fed. HSBC and others sold the US dollar at 34.9375 yuan, and also made a deal at 35 yuan, and English gold could be settled at 10.375 pence, so the gold price broke 40 taels again, falling straight downstream by 12-13 taels, only fluctuating by a few taels at times, until 11:30, when 34 taels was seen again. Afterwards, Huabao Bank bought forward US dollars at 35 yuan, and recently settled at 34.875 yuan, which was difficult to obtain, so retail short sellers came to resist. At noon, it was 43.5 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that the Indian exchange rate reported a large rupee, which was immediately reduced to 40 taels. When the market closed at 42.6 taels, and then made a deal at 45-50 taels, goods arbitrage and Shunli and others were dragging in, and the opening price was changed to 706 taels, a deduction of 70-60 taels.</p>
<p>▲Later Market Competed to Sell, Price Falls Without End. The later market opened initially at 43 taels, then at 40 taels. Afterwards, arbitrage did not enter, and Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Qunchangyong, and others competed to enter. The retail buyers were also tireless in buying. English gold was only settled at 10.25 pence, and the final gold was 34.8125 yuan. In January, English gold was offered by Sumitomo of Shanghai at 1.875, so the price rose to 47.5 taels, but Guangbang sold, and seemed to fall slightly. Subsequently, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxingyong, Tongtaichang, and Dalianbang all came to sell, and immediately went downstream, retreating to 40 taels. After 3 o'clock, the Indian exchange rate was again a large rupee, and the US dollar gradually loosened, with 35.26 yuan difficult to sell. After 3:30, it was 31 taels. In a moment, it pulled up 4-5 taels again. At 3:45, it was 36 taels, and retail buyers entered. Afterwards, the waves were excited, Zhifengyonghengyu, Cuichangyong, Yuanmaoyong, Hengchangyong, and others eagerly sold, and there was a mountain sinking and sea tilting. The market was full of sorrow and mold. English gold could be settled at 10.5 pence, and US dollars at 35.25-375, so the market price fell by ten taels. At 4:15, the new price was 26 taels. Guangbang took the opportunity to drag in, so the market closed at 4:30 at 29.5 taels. Unexpectedly, retail investors sold off, and it fell again to 25 taels. In the morning, after 26-27 taels, compared to the day before yesterday (according to the listed price), there was a violent drop of 26 taels. The maximum during the day was 48 taels, and the minimum was 26 taels, a difference of 22 taels. The goods market was 44 taels in the morning, 45 taels at noon, 44.5 taels in the afternoon, and 25.5 taels at the close. The opening price was estimated to be 70-80 taels inside and outside. The account was settled and water was added: 43 taels in the morning and 30 taels in the afternoon, a red strip flat, totaling 9 taels added.</p>
<p>▲Market Transactions Were Chaotic and Disorderly. Transactions on the counter were extremely chaotic, and it was not easy to find out. According to statistics, Zhifengyong, Tianfengyong, Shunli, Yuda, Wanxing, and Qianchangxiang all entered. Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yuantai, Yifeng, and Dadecheng entered and exited quite busy. Hengchangyong, Hengxing, Futaiheng, Yongde, Chengfengyong, Yuancangyong, and Yuanfengyong all exited. In the afternoon, Yuandayong, Dadecheng, Taifengcheng, Goods, Wanxing, Shunli, Yifengyong, and Qianchangxiang all entered. Yuantai, Futaiheng, Tongfu, and Cuichangyong had occasional entries and exits. Hengchangyong, Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, Yuanmaoyong, Yifeng, and Yuanxingyong all exited. Hengxing exited and then entered again. A total of six or seven hundred entries and exits were checked. Goods initially entered, and speculators entered and exited inconsistently. The remaining companies had frequent entries and exits. Dalianbang has reversed to bullish, with a total of 5,000 entries and 1,600-1,700 exits. Guangbang has a total of 2,000 exits and 600-700 entries, still occupying a short position.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Foreign Exchange Increases by Four Levels in a Row <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>▲The Domestic Market is Extremely Loose...People are Panicked</p>
<p>Yesterday, the English and American silver markets increased fiercely, and the market situation was extremely firm. However, the exchange rate between English and American currencies decreased, and the exchange rate between American and English currencies increased. Shanghai market felt particularly weak. HSBC listed and increased prices by as much as four levels, with English gold increasing by one pence, currently at one shilling nine pence seventy-five. The US dollar increased by one and a half yuan, reaching 34 yuan. Hong Kong decreased by five cents, to 76 taels 1875. All other exchange rates have increased. The domestic market is unusually loose, but the complexity is confusing. The gold market had a fluctuation of over 20 taels, eventually plummeting by 26 taels. The result was that English gold increased by .875 compared to the day before yesterday, exceeding 10 pence. The US dollar increased by 1.25 yuan, also exceeding 35 yuan. People are panicked, but Chinese merchants are trading intensely. The morning market exited and re-entered, and the afternoon market first pulled and then collapsed. The situation was chaotic. Mumbai also came to sell English gold, and most of the gold industry was arbitraging. It is estimated that there were about 200,000-300,000 pounds of English gold coming in and out. The US dollar traded for over one million. There is no new news from abroad, but the Japanese bandits in the Northeast are becoming increasingly violent, so the market situation is affected.</p>
<p>▲English Exchange Rate: The domestic market had a difference of half a penny. The early market price was one shilling ten pence, and the buying price was ten pence .0625 (this is the agreed price). Afterwards, Maccari bought December at ten and a half pence, and Zhongfu Shanghai made a deal at the same price. Meifeng and Maccari also made a recent deal with Shanghai offering 1.875, and offering January 25. Holland and Mitsui mutually made a deal at .3125. Zhengjin offered recent deals at .375. The noon close offered .3125-.25, and the buying price was increased by .0625. In the afternoon, Huabi of Shanghai offered March at .25, and Shanghai also offered January at 1.875. Sumitomo also offered the same price. The closing price offered ten and a half pence to .4375, and the buying price was .5625 to half a penny.</p>
<p>American Exchange Rate: The domestic market fluctuated by 75 all day long. The initial price offered in the early market was about 34.5 yuan, and the buying price was .625. Dongya offered January at 35.125 yuan. Huabi offered December at the same price, and also offered January at .0625 to 34.9375 yuan (Fuchang pulled). It also offered .8125 with Shanghai, and Dongya entered at .875. Zhengjin HSBC mutually made a deal at 35 yuan. HSBC offered 34.9375 yuan. Zhengjin Huabi mutually made a deal for December at 35 yuan. Huabi offered 34.875 yuan. Shanghai entered March at 35 yuan, and also offered December at 34.875 yuan. The noon close offered 34.75-.875 yuan, and the buying price was increased by .125. In the afternoon, Huabi offered January at .8125. HSBC entered March at .8125, and also offered January at 35 yuan to 34.9375 yuan. The closing price offered 35.25-.375 yuan, and the buying price was .375 to 35.5 yuan. It also listed one yuan equal to two taels, nine qian, four fen, and 117 yun.</p>
<h3 id="e114">English and American Silver Prices Rise Sharply in Unison <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>According to the London telegraph, the silver market suddenly turned long again, with recent deals rising sharply by .6875, to 19 pence .5625, a new record for the year 12. Forward deals also increased by .6875, to 19 pence .4375. The spot market rose due to a lack of sellers. India had purchases, and the market was uncertain. After the market closed, there were even buyers at the listed price, and the market situation continued to increase. According to the New York telegraph, the US silver price also saw a sharp increase, with spot prices increasing by 1.5 cents, to 3.275 yuan. The exchange rate between English and American currencies decreased by .75, to 3.7525 yuan. The exchange rate between American and English currencies increased by .75, to 3.765 yuan.

<h3 id="e116">News of Exporting Silver, Foreign Currency, and Subsidiary Coins <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, news of exporting foreign currency remained sluggish, with only over 400,000 exported. However, sources from the interior, etc., still accounted for over 300,000. Regarding the export of subsidiary coins, a large number of Guǎngjiǎo (Guangdong coins) have recently been shipped to Dalian and the northern routes. Some individuals are even buying old jiǎo to melt them down for profit. As a result, Guǎngjiǎo are becoming increasingly scarce on the market, and prices are gradually rising. However, there are currently signs of slight relaxation, so prices have slightly eased.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Securities and Bond Market is Increasingly Stagnant <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>▲ Spot Prices Fall Sharply...Market Conditions Show Little Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 6th), the bond market conditions at the Huáshāng (Chinese merchants) Securities Exchange: the futures market was calm and sluggish, and there was not much activity in spot trading. The news regarding the Guólián (League of Nations) was silent, and Japan was still actively invading the Northeast. With no improvement in the diplomatic situation and no progress in the domestic peace and unification conference, the general public was filled with doubts. Large investors remained cautious as before and did not make large investments, putting the market in a pessimistic situation. Bond price fluctuations shifted according to the temporary circumstances of the market, leading to a rather chaotic trend. The 20-year customs bonds, consolidated tax bonds, and salt tax bonds experienced significant fluctuations. In the morning, due to nervous sentiment, prices once fell from 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 6 or 7 jiǎo. In the second round, short covering caused a slight increase in demand, so prices rebounded. However, the market weakened again afterward, and other bonds fluctuated without a consistent trend. As a result, spot prices fell sharply due to the lack of market prices for several days. In the futures market, only the demobilization bond for next month continued to decline by a small amount of 1 yuan and 3 jiǎo. Other bonds only declined by a small amount of 1 or 2 jiǎo to 6 or 7 jiǎo. Judging from the current state of the bond market, it is still in a chaotic state. If there are no other changes in the bond market environment, it is not possible to be overly optimistic about the market. The total daily spot trading volume was 22,000 yuan, the morning futures volume was over 7.3 million, and the afternoon volume was 2.9 million, totaling 10.265 million yuan.

<p>The yarn market remains weak, with a very soft trend. Due to the financial emergency and ongoing national disputes, commerce cannot develop, resulting in an extremely bleak market atmosphere. Furthermore, large investors are selling off, while new purchases are relatively few. The future of the yarn market is still in a slump.</p>
<p>▲ Major Investors Selling Off "Rén Biāo" (Yarn Exchange Standard Contracts): At the opening of the "Rén Biāo" market, the atmosphere was quite flat, with prices falling by 7 or 8 qián. In the second and third rounds, prices rebounded. As a result, near-term contracts fell by 1, 3, or 5 qián, while far-term contracts rose by 1 or 4 qián. In the afternoon, the market situation fluctuated again, with prices falling by 1, 2, 4, or 6 qián. The total trading volume was 29,500 bales. It was found that Yuánfēng sold 4,600 bales, Yìchǎng sold 1,100 bales, and Dàchāngchéng sold 1,100 bales. Tàixīng bought 2,000 bales, Yìyú bought 1,350 bales, and Zhèndà bought 900 bales.

<h3 id="e119">The Cotton Market Continues to See Factory Sell-offs <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak. Due to the loose exchange rates, the silver price for calculating the cost of imported cotton is very cheap, even 1 or 2 taels lower than the previous day. Furthermore, the Shēn Xīn textile mill has purchased over 10,000 bales of Indian and American cotton. Manufacturers are still hedging a large number of future contracts. However, merchants from the Hàn帮 (Hubei) region and some cotton merchants are holding tight and not releasing their cotton, and their intention to squeeze shorts this month has not diminished. Furthermore, Reuters reported that Russia has 1,000 train cars of cotton ready to be dumped on the European market, indicating a surplus of cotton worldwide. Therefore, large investors and manufacturers are continuously selling off, creating a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>▲ The "Hàn Biāo" (Hankou Cotton Exchange Standard Contracts) Market is Affected by Imported Cotton: At the opening of the "Hàn Biāo" market, prices fell by 2 qián due to the weakness of American cotton and the sharp rise in silver prices. Later, prices rebounded due to some short covering, resulting in a flat market. In the afternoon, news of a large batch of imported cotton being traded caused the market to fall slightly by 5 fēn to 1 qián. The total daily trading volume was 120,000 dan. It was found that Héngdà sold 2,000 dan, Dàfú sold 9,600 dan, Méijì sold 2,800 dan, Tàixīng sold 5,600 dan, Yìchéng sold 3,100 dan, Chángfēng sold 3,900 dan, and Chánghé sold 2,000 dan. Ruìyuán bought 8,000 dan, Jífēng bought 2,700 dan, Yìyú bought 5,000 dan, and Yuándà bought 3,600 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to purchases by speculators, but later weakened due to sales from the South and a slump on Wall Street. Futures prices rose by 4 to 7 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. English cotton futures rose by 1 point, and spot prices rose by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton weakened due to sales by European exporters and speculators. The market closed quietly and steadily. Pingguoer and Luoxi rose by 0.75 Rupees, and Aomula rose by 1.5 Rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram dated the 5th):</p>

<p>New York, 5th: The McFadden Company estimates that the current cotton production will be 16,630,000 bales, an increase of 733,000 bales compared to the previous estimate (October 5th). The number of bales ginned is 11,822,000.</p>

<p>▲ Nantou: Yesterday, the supply of goods arriving via the Xiang Road continued, and the upward trend subsided slightly. Boat shipments opened at nearly 1,000 shi per boat. Various shops did not respond by adding more stock, and customers were also affected. Xixin (new west) and Sutong (Suzhou-Tongzhou) japonica rice each weakened by 2 jiǎo. The supply of Yaozhong (kiln-dried) Baige rice increased, but the local market had a poor appetite, and the market for Ningbo rice was also small, with prices good at nearly 1 jiǎo. Yang Duijian (foreign Dujiang) and Baipo (white broken) rice from rural villages had some sales, and the outlook was firm. Glutinous rice and white paddy rice sales were slow. The situation fluctuated.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha: Yesterday, there were over 40 suppliers. The retail sales of Zhongguan (central customs) goods also showed no improvement, and shop owners felt increasingly stuck. The market appeared weak. Chonggu (Chongming-Guji) Qingjiao (green horn) and Fenglian (maple training) varieties were ignored, and prices were reduced by 1 or 2 jiǎo. The supply of Xixin (new west) japonica rice and Tingyin rice was not large, and sales were also slow, with prices reduced by another 2 jiǎo. The supply of Bujian (pier head) rice was not strong, and river merchants and factories had some inventory. Various firms slightly increased their spot sales of small Jiaomi (milled rice), but transactions were not smooth, and opening prices decreased.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Forward Foreign Rice Market is Very Active <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market: Spot prices were mainly watched by locals due to the fall in the forward market, so the market only saw about 1,000 bags of small Jiaoxiao (milled rice) from Saigon being dealt with for local needs. Market prices were similar to the previous day. Forward trading remained active. In addition to local purchases, merchants from the Yangtze River region also inquired. Foreign firms were happy to attract business because the gold price had fallen back and transportation was cost-effective. The whole market saw Jinlong Foreign Firm selling 2,000 tons of April-May small Jiaoxiao and Tianxiang selling 1,500 tons, both at 5 taels and 1 qián. Tianxiang also sold 500 tons each of November-December Saigon No. 1 rice, and bought back several hundred tons of small Jiaoxiao for immediate loading and December delivery. Market prices were lower than the previous day, likely due to the influence of the gold market.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Marked Powder Market is About to Collapse <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of both the morning and afternoon powder markets, the market for various months suddenly showed signs of instability. Although the quotation for foreign wheat had rebounded by 3 or 4 jiǎo, the gold market had weakened, and the exchange rate was increasing. From this, it was speculated that the rise in foreign wheat prices would inevitably be hampered again. This situation of easy rise and fall was difficult to grasp for the time being. The situation abroad could not be predicted. Because of this situation, sentiment turned soft, and selling pressure gradually increased, falling by 2 or 3 fēn compared to the peak of the previous day. However, sentiment gradually stabilized at the close. As a result, this month's contract fell by 1.5 fēn compared to the previous day, December fell by 2 fēn, January fell by 1 fēn, February fell by 1 fēn and 2 lí and a half, March fell by 2 fēn, and April fell by 1 fēn.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of both the morning and afternoon forward wheat markets, the market for various months showed signs of weakening. Although the price of foreign wheat had rebounded by 3 or 4 jiǎo, the gold price was falling, and the exchange rate was increasing, so there was hope for fixed securities in the future. Therefore, most people, learning from previous mistakes, inevitably became apprehensive. Although large sell-offs did not occur, sentiment softened. Observing future developments, if the gold market falls again, the market will still be weak and sluggish. As a result, this month's contract fell by 5 fēn compared to the previous day, December fell by 4 fēn, January fell by 4 fēn, February fell by 3 fēn, March fell by 5 fēn, and April fell by 3 fēn.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to sugar market area telegrams, the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.34175, New York futures sugar for December was 1.33, March next year was 1.29, May was 1.33, each rising 1 fen compared to the previous telegram. September was 1.42, a drop of 1 fen. Java's current and futures sugar were each 375. In the Association market, the trading mood was calm. The transaction price of Dutch No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was 10 taels and 9 qián, and No. 20 center white was 10 taels and 6 qián, a drop of 1 qián and a half. The market sentiment was still loose. The inflow and outflow of Taikoo sugar was also quiet, with B mark at 12 taels and 1 qián to 12 taels, HX mark at 11 taels and 8 qián and a half, and HM mark at 11 taels and 3 qián and 7 and a half fēn, all showing a decline. And with little interest, the market atmosphere was declining, showing signs of continued downward movement. Transactions in the Board (Public) market were even quieter.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Saturday, the foreign firm silk market in this port was even more lonely and lifeless. During the mid-autumn and spring seasons, European firms had no negotiations, and with the increase in foreign exchange rates, silk prices declined further. Chinese merchants were even more cautious. Yesterday, He Xing purchased 5 bales of Huang Yaojing (yellow reeled silk), and Samsung purchased 5 bales of Bai Qianjing (white dried silk), with flat and sluggish prices.</p>
<p>(Correction) In the last issue, on the 31st of last month, this column published an item stating that 50 pieces of Zhejiang Huzhou Baichangjing (white factory silk) were shipped to Shanghai. After investigation, it was found to be Jilijiejing (Jili reeled silk), not Datong brand factory silk. This is hereby corrected.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of foreign firms in this port, the needle, eyebrow, and bead tea of the Luzhuang (land tea) and Tuzhuang (local tea) routes were being actively handled by British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Jinlong, and Fushi. Transactions were quite active, but selling prices were again 2 or 3 taels lower. Zhenmei (precious eyebrow) green tea from the Tuzhuang route also had some scattered sales. Upper and middle-grade goods were still ignored, and Gōngxī (tribute tea) items from the Russian Assistance Association did not have a large demand. The market outlook gradually declined.</p>

<p>Recently, transactions of smokeless iron have been like spring grass after a rain. The supply of goods is not large, and the inventory is drying up, so there is a risk of not being able to meet sales. Due to the trend of the environment, the standard is rising steadily, and even in this period of large external influx, there is still a trend of continuous increase. The price is 12 taels per dan, an increase of 2 qián and a half compared to before. According to reports, yesterday's market saw transactions such as 300 dan from the Fujian merchants, 250 dan from the Sichuan merchants, and 450 dan from the Tianjin and Yantai merchants. Because the underlying inventory is scarce, the market shows signs of continued improvement.</p>

At 4:00 in the afternoon, they continued to hold the sixth preparatory meeting, passing the proposal to establish a National Fiscal Reorganization Committee. It was decided that the seventh preparatory meeting would be held at 9:00 this morning. At that time, the Beijing representative, Zhang Ji, will come to Shanghai from Beijing to attend, report on the issues of the Fourth Plenary Session, convey the intentions of the Beijing side, and discuss compromise solutions. The news obtained yesterday is summarized below:</p>
<h3 id="e132">Morning Discussion Meeting <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The representatives arrived one after another at 9:20 in the morning. After a brief rest, they began the discussion meeting at 9:30. The Guangdong representatives, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Wu Chaoshu, Chen Youren, and Zou Lu, all attended. From the Nanjing side, except for Zhang Ji, who remained in Beijing to negotiate, and Li Shizeng, who was absent due to illness, the remaining four representatives, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jingjiang, and Chen Mingshu, all attended. Both sides continued to discuss the issue of convening the Fourth National Congress, and the discussion was mostly completed by 10:30. Because representatives from labor and academic circles had come to petition and needed to present their petitions in person, Wang Jingwei and Cai Yuanpei were publicly selected to represent both the Beijing and Guangdong sides and receive representatives from various schools, labor unions, and university professors, until noon. The Beijing and Guangdong representatives then continued their discussions, which concluded at 1:00, and it was decided to formally resume the sixth preparatory meeting at 4:00 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Afternoon Sixth Meeting <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>

<p>The issue of convening the Fourth Plenary Session was the focus of contention between the two sides. During the discussion meeting yesterday morning, the representatives repeatedly discussed it in order to find a compromise solution that would satisfy both governments. At the formal meeting in the afternoon, the Beijing representative, Zhang Ji, called from Beijing, stating that the Beijing side had discussed and found a proper solution to the issue of the Fourth Plenary Session. He requested that the issue not be resolved at today's meeting, and that he would return to Shanghai tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) to attend the meeting, report in detail, and then proceed with a public vote. Therefore, the issue was not formally discussed at yesterday's meeting. It is expected that a considerable conclusion will be reached on this issue at the seventh preparatory meeting today.</p>
<h3 id="e135">List of Petitioning Representatives <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>At 10:30 yesterday morning, the representatives who went to the Wu residence to petition included the presidents and faculty members of nine universities: Sheng Zhenwei of Soochow University, Ou Yuanhuai of Great China University, Fu Shishuo and Wang Yuxiang of Shanghai University, Liu Zhanen and Zhang Chunjiang of Shanghai Baptist College, Chen Mengyu, Lu Fushan, and Gong Muyu of East Asia University, Shen Junru of Shanghai Law College, Quan Tongyin, Lin Jiyong, and Zhang Yi of Fudan University, Cao Liangxia and Zhao Enlang of Datong University, Li Zuohui and Liu Shijie of Jiangnan University, Hu Qibing and Rong Qizhao of Kwang Hua University. Representatives of the National Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation petitioning delegation included Chen Yaosheng from Zhejiang, Cao Zongzhi from Hunan, Han Jixian from Shanghai, Yang Yongyi from Shanxi, Zhu Songxi from Jiangsu, Yuan Jinzhang from Ningxia, Song Sixiang from Anhui, Yuan Qijiong from Nanjing, Li Yunqing from Shaanxi, Tang Guanglie from Hubei, Du Bingkang from Fujian, Zhang Chengxian from Henan, Shi Tonggang from the Association of Students Studying in Japan, and Yan Qingping from Tianjin. On the labor union side, the representatives who attended included the sign industry union, the inn and Beiyang reception union, the silk spitting union, the straw hat industry union, the leg industry union, the new clothing worker's union, the inn and Yangtze reception union, the Nanyang sock factory union, the Huiguan (Anhui guildhall) worker's union, the Nanhua (southern goods) worker's union, the Huafa (French-Chinese) cleaning union, the Taikang Food Company union, the Hongbai (red and white) timber industry union, the manufacturing peasant union, the scale industry union, the tea worker's union, the French business hydro-electric union, the Shengde manufacturing factory union, and the Shanghai Jeyin Newspaper Delivery union, and over one hundred other groups.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Situation of Receiving Representatives <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>When Mr. Wang and Mr. Cai received the representatives, the National Student Union first put forward five points: (1) Please report the past situation of the Peace Conference; (2) Please report the specific proposals for this conference; (3) State the resolutions of this conference: (A) If peace breaks down, a telegram will be sent to all schools across the country to strike; (B) This union believes that those who undermine peaceful unification are public enemies of the nation; (C) The Peace Conference should be open to the public; (4) Please limit the achievement of peaceful unification to before December 12th; (5) Before peaceful unification is achieved, please postpone the convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the KMT between the Beijing and Guangdong sides.</p>
<p>Following this, the labor representatives stated their opinions, requesting the representatives of the Nanjing and Guangdong sides to continue discussing peaceful solutions in Shanghai. Before a solution is reached, the representatives should not go to Beijing for the time being, and two petitions were presented in person.</p>
<p>Then, representatives from various universities expressed their views. Initially, Cao Liangxia from Datong University stated the points of this petition, earnestly requesting the representatives of Nanjing and Guangdong to discard their differences and adopt the three points previously submitted by the union in writing. At this point, Liu Zhanen from Shanghai University also stated that since the incident in the East Province (Manchuria), the youth students in Shanghai have been extremely indignant. The Peace Conference has not yet reached a solution today, and the youth students all want to cry without a place to do so. He and others also hold positions as teachers and, seeing this situation, they really cannot lead the youth. Speaking to this point, Mr. Liu was choked with emotion and could not continue. After a long pause, he continued, "When the Pacific International Academic Conference was held in Shanghai previously, I was also one of the Chinese representatives. During the discussions, we also discussed the Japanese atrocities. I deeply feel that domestic peace and unity are so difficult to achieve. How can we seek external assistance? Therefore, I sincerely hope that the representatives of Nanjing and Guangdong will immediately discard their prejudices and work together to overcome the national crisis."</p>
<p>Next, Shen Junru from the Law School also expressed his views, deeply concerned that the peaceful unity of Nanjing and Guangdong cannot be achieved immediately. He also said that holding the Peace Conference in the concession, if it ends in failure, will surely be ridiculed by all nations. In the past, the Northern warlord Wu Peifu was scorned for seeking refuge in the concession after his defeat. You are all advanced members of the party and the country. This Peace Conference will surely be successful and seek a unified approach to foreign affairs.</p>
<p>When Mr. Shen spoke to this point, Zhang Yi from Fudan University was about to continue speaking when Mr. Wang Jingwei, the representative of Guangdong, suddenly became angry and said, "Please allow me to answer your questions first. If I cannot, I will withdraw from the meeting." Zhang then hesitated and stopped speaking. Then, Wang gave a detailed reply (record omitted). After Mr. Wang finished speaking, he continued to ask the representatives to express their opinions. Zhang Yi, the representative of Fudan University, spoke, requesting that the representatives achieve a peaceful solution within three days at the latest. If either the Nanjing or Guangdong sides intentionally obstruct it, the peaceful representatives of both sides should strive with their lives. This is the time for party members to sacrifice themselves for the country. Future generations will have their own judgment. Wang and others listened and applauded greatly, and expressed their complete acceptance. Then, Cai Yuanpei replied, roughly saying that based on the current trend, the Fourth Plenary Session should be held first, and then the government should be reorganized.</p>
<h3 id="e137">▲Two Petitions from Various Trade Unions (Petition One) <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Representatives of the Nanjing-Guangdong Peace Conference:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our country has been weak for many years and has been frequently invaded by foreign powers. After the revolution, human affairs were still not stable. The traitor Yuan Shikai claimed himself emperor before, and Zhang Xun restored the monarchy after. Descending to Cao Kun and Wu Peifu, they exhausted their troops and engaged in constant warfare, with corpses lying everywhere. The country's vitality has been damaged and the nation's life almost extinguished. Fortunately, our party launched an expedition to the south, comforting the people and punishing the guilty. With the comrades advancing and falling one after another, and the compatriots working together with one heart, we were able to create a unified situation in the seventeenth year of the Republic. We hoped to stabilize society from then on, begin construction, secure the country like a lush mulberry tree, and place the people on comfortable mats. However, looking back at the past, things did not go as we wished. The warlords Cao Kun and Wu Peifu were overthrown by the armed forces of the entire nation, but those who followed Cao Kun and Wu Peifu are alive and well. As a result, the flames of war have repeatedly flared up. Recently, Japan has invaded, and Liaoning and Jilin have been occupied. The danger to the nation's lifeline is indeed unprecedented. At this time, the representatives of Guangdong were able to come without blaming the past, and the representatives of Nanjing were also able to be open and honest, and gathered in Shanghai for discussions. This is truly the great fortune of the country. Unexpectedly, after only a few days of discussion, the future is again presenting a pessimistic outlook. At this time when the nation's lifeline is hanging by a thread, our unions are deeply worried and cannot help but make some statements to the representatives:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the important nature of the Peace Conference. Internally, the communists are rampant, and disaster victims are everywhere. Externally, powerful neighbors are invading and occupying our territory. This conference is the key to resisting foreign aggression and pacifying the country. If the conference unfortunately breaks down, the nation will be in increasing danger. Therefore, the representatives of Nanjing and Guangdong should proceed as quickly as possible to achieve unification, and should not affect the Peace Conference due to the issue of preserving the position of any individual, and plant disaster for the nation.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the scope of discussion of the Peace Conference. The internal disintegration is the result of various bad causes, and these bad causes are the unsuitable fundamental system. Therefore, the scope of discussion of the Peace Conference should focus on the reform of the fundamental system. Regarding the reform of the fundamental system, the principle of separation of military and political affairs has already been decided at the previous conference, which is exactly what the people of the whole country support. Unexpectedly, a certain member of the Central Committee in Nanjing said that this fundamental system (text is suspected to be missing). It should be known that if this conference does not discuss the reform of the fundamental system, how can future disputes be eliminated? Currently, the fundamental reforms of the military and political systems have been decided, and the only item that has not been decided is party affairs. And the important matters of party affairs that must be decided in this conference are the same as the fundamental systems of military and political affairs that must be decided in the Peace Conference.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the location of the conference. The location of the conference is closely related to the outcome of the Peace Conference. If it is bound by the military force of one side, and free will cannot be expressed, now it is heard that the Nanjing side is urging the representatives to go to Beijing for the meeting. Our unions believe that the location of the meeting can follow the example of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second National Congress and be held in Shanghai, so that the representatives of both sides can have complete and full freedom of speech.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding diplomatic issues. Regarding diplomatic issues, it was previously heard that a consistent plan has been decided by both sides. What the plan is has not been disclosed in detail. However, our unions hope to recover the lost territories in the shortest possible time and protect our sovereignty. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past, allowing the Japanese army to trample on us and boast of non-resistance, allowing the territory to be lost and pretend to be calm. Now, based on the principle that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, we humbly offer our views for your consideration. If you are willing to accept what we have said, and achieve a permanent and genuine peace and unification, pacify the country and resist foreign aggression, we will rely on this one action, and we will be eagerly awaiting your orders.</p>

<p>(Petition Two) Regarding the request to continue holding the Peace Conference in Shanghai in order to meet the people's expectations.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Peace Conference, it has been almost ten days. The trade unions and others are eager for peace to be achieved as soon as possible in order to achieve a consistent effect of banning insults. However, peace is not achieved in the end, and resisting insults is really out of the question. You, gentlemen, have either traveled across oceans and mediated everywhere, or have come to Shanghai from thousands of miles away, originally wanting to seek the early realization of peace. How could it be known that your hard work for peaceful unification and national salvation would not be understood by others, but instead would be taken advantage of, and every effort would be made to entice you to go to Nanjing? You, gentlemen, should know that coming to Shanghai to seek peace was already a misstep. Planning for almost ten days has only gained the air of peace. If you go to Nanjing again, even the air of peace will disappear. The trade unions and others look to the future with unspeakable worries. We earnestly request you, gentlemen, to continue holding the meeting in Shanghai in order to complete the entire work of the Peace Conference and achieve the real effect of unification and resisting insults. The trade unions and others are overwhelmed with urgency and await your orders.</p>
<p>Respectfully presented to all the representatives of the Nanjing Peace and Unification Conference.</p>

<h3 id="e138">▲Cai's Response to Student Representatives: Cai Yuanpei <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Gave a reply, saying roughly: "Now China is united externally, and it can be said that it has achieved peaceful unification. What we are discussing is how to seek peace permanently in the future, but this is not a simple matter. Many past disputes and mistakes were not a matter of people, but partly a matter of the system. Changing the system should be decided by the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang, so Nanjing advocates holding the Fourth Plenary Session first. As for student strikes, this is what I am most opposed to. Today's students are the future leaders of China. For the sake of saving the country, they should pay attention to cultivating their own abilities and not take a dead end. Many patriotic people throw themselves into the sea and starve themselves because of the urgency of the national crisis. These are not solutions. In areas invaded by foreign enemies, it is impossible to study. Everyone sacrifices to save the country is out of necessity. Therefore, I advise students everywhere to concentrate on their studies and not use strikes as a slogan."</p>
<h3 id="e139">▲Wang's Talk to Labor and Student Representatives: Just Now <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>I heard what the labor and student representatives said, and I want to say something. I am representing the opinions of the comrades in Guangdong and giving a simple reply. Regarding the content of this Peace Conference, nothing is not public. All the proposals, except for a few, are published in the newspapers every day. The few that are not published are not intentionally kept secret. Moreover, there are three or two points that have not been published regarding diplomatic issues. This is certainly not because we are unwilling to make them public to our compatriots, but because diplomatic issues are not convenient for foreign countries to know. This is the reason why a very small number have not been published. I hope that all compatriots will forgive this point. Speaking of the progress of the Peace Conference, the first two days were about diplomatic issues. This is certainly for the sake of the national crisis, and of course, it must be dealt with urgently. Speaking of diplomatic issues, the Nanjing government has already obtained international recognition, so the negotiations should of course be done by the Nanjing government. However, the diplomatic guidelines and principles will be decided at this conference and handed over to the Nanjing government for implementation. Mr. Cai just said that the diplomatic situation is already unified, which is true. However, the so-called diplomatic unity of origin should be limited. For example, we certainly do not agree with the invasion of foreign troops without resistance or the loss of territory without anyone being responsible. This is not within the scope of diplomatic unity. In the following two days, this conference began to discuss the "Central Political System Reform Plan." Everyone should have seen these in the newspapers. The original intention of the Guangdong representatives in this trip was to first seek diplomatic unity externally, and then to have both sides organize a unified conference internally, and the unified conference would produce a unified government. After the new government is established, Mr. Jiang in Nanjing will resign immediately, and the Guangdong National Government will be abolished. Before this fact is implemented, both parties should make a statement to the people of their willingness to abolish them. That is to say, each party will issue a telegram. This was the original intention of Mr. Cai, Zhang, and Chen's consultations with us, and it is also the firm position of the Guangdong side. This is also the original intention of our coming to Shanghai for discussions. There is no need to hide this intention from everyone at all, because we feel that a country must have a government with unified power before it can show its strength externally, and only then can it seek the establishment of a foundation for democratic politics internally. We should not talk about the rights and wrongs of the past, but hurry up and start over to deal with this urgent situation. This is also the issue that the comrades of both sides in the Nanjing-Guangdong conference are humbly trying to solve. Mr. Cai just said that the Nanjing side's opinion later was that the Central Political System Reform Plan cannot be decided in this way and should be resolved in the Fourth Plenary Session. The original intention of Guangdong was to reorganize the government first, and then go to Nanjing to hold the Fourth Plenary Session. Nanjing thought that the reform of the central political system must be resolved in the Fourth Plenary Session, so they advocated holding the Fourth Plenary Session first. They also believed that the Japanese had already limited the withdrawal of troops to the 16th, so we should hold the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing before the 16th and before the 12th to show the unity of China. Therefore, the opinions of the two sides are different, and what is considered difficult now is this point. Some people asked me, "Why don't the Guangdong representatives go to Nanjing for the meeting?" This is because the Nanjing government has not been reorganized, so we should not go to Nanjing. There are many examples of holding meetings in Shanghai in the past. Wasn't there one held in Shanghai in December of the 16th year of the Republic? But perhaps it will be said that it is too unreasonable for you to hold meetings in Shanghai. Doesn't it show the cracks of division? I believe that the fact is still the fact. The fact that the Kuomintang is separated should be acknowledged. The student representatives just said that it is the responsibility of the party, which is correct. This responsibility should be borne by the Kuomintang. Today, Kuomintang members oppose the Kuomintang government. Don't think that the government of the Northern warlords and the government of Yuan Shikai are not party governments, so we should oppose them. The Nanjing government is a government created by the Kuomintang, so we are unwilling to oppose it. This is an unreasonable reason. We only ask whether this government is good or not, and do not ask whether it is a government created by the party or not. The worse the government created by the party, the more we party members should oppose it. Today's division is a fact. If we want to put on a show, hurry up and hold the Fourth Plenary Session on the 12th. Not to mention that the four hundred representatives from Guangdong cannot come to Nanjing, even six representatives will not easily enter. It is necessary to reorganize the government first and organize a government that everyone believes in and that the people support. Then we can enter Nanjing. Therefore, the different opinions of the two sides in the past few days are like this. All twelve of us representatives are working hard to find a good way, a way that both governments agree on. We are discussing this matter every day, and there is nothing that cannot be told to the public. I believe that in the future, in order to resolve China's disputes, there is no good way other than using political methods. Politics cannot be resolved by military means. Military resolution of political disputes will only mean that a military force will always exist, and China will never be good. Since the news of the Japanese soldiers' atrocities in the three northeastern provinces, neither side can use troops anymore, and war will certainly not be able to be reborn. Please rest assured, all representatives. However, in order to achieve the goal of resolving disputes and achieving lasting peace, we must have good methods and use political methods to organize a unified government. The principle of organizing a unified government should be democratization, so that it is in line with the principle of democracy. According to the program of the period of political tutelage in the Outline of National Construction, we must do it step by step. This statement means that during the period of political tutelage, in terms of time, civil rights are expanding day by day; in terms of space, civil rights are increasing day by day, from one county to one province, and to the whole country. Today's responsibility lies in being able to work together with one heart and one mind to transform the government successfully. This is not only the hope of every party member, but also the hope of the entire nation. But if it is said that the reorganization of the government must be resolved in the Fourth Plenary Session, then it is difficult. I remember that the National Government that was talked about was also reorganized by the Standing Committee after the closing of the Third Plenary Session in the 17th year of the Republic. The Standing Committee decided on the candidates for chairman and the candidates for the heads of the five branches of government. How can it be necessary to resolve it in the Fourth Plenary Session this time? Now is the time when the national crisis is at its height, and it is necessary to seek unity urgently. The opinions requested by the representatives are like this, and our stay here and our efforts to compromise are also like this. Fortunately, the representatives of both sides can discuss sincerely in order to achieve the goal of peaceful unification. Therefore, the future of peace is not without hope.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Wang's Response to University Representatives <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>You are all gentlemen of the intellectual world, and I am very willing to ask for advice. Since the 18th year of the Republic, I have been a person who has always opposed the Nanjing government. The Nanjing government is a party government. The meaning of my opposition is because all the political manifestations of the Nanjing government are military politics, not democratic politics. If it is thought that the party government is not good, and we cannot oppose it because of the face of the party, then this is not good for the party and not good for the principles. I am a member of the party and a member of the nation. What is not good about the party government? Not only party members should rise up to oppose it, but also the people should rise up to oppose it. Since the 18th year of the Republic, there has been fighting in the country every day. Is this government good or not? I hope you will make a judgment. If you think the government is not good, you should rise up to oppose the government. If you think we are not good, then please knock us down. If you think both of us are not good, then please knock both of us down. We must first recognize the rights and wrongs, and then the disputes of the party and the country can be resolved. Who does not want peace? But peace is not just a matter of words. There must be a way, and at the same time, we must look at all kinds of situations and the current situation. I just heard Mr. Shen say that in the midst of internal troubles and foreign enemies, our meeting in Shanghai and not entering Nanjing, and meeting in the concession, is not a joke. But I am not Wu Peifu. Wu Peifu took an oath not to enter the concession. I am engaged in revolution using the methods of a world revolutionary. In the past, I have drifted and wandered to the east, west, north, and south. I can also go abroad immediately in the future, and I can also go to Hong Kong suddenly. Since I fled overseas in the 18th year, I have always been running around in all directions. As long as it is for the revolution, where can I not go? In the time of the Qing Dynasty, we organized the headquarters of the Tongmenghui in Japan. We were not afraid of people saying that we were taking refuge in imperialism and not engaging in revolution. I am even more not afraid of people using the set of internal troubles and foreign enemies to intimidate me. In the time of the Qing Dynasty, we also did not stop the revolution because people said that the revolution would be enough to cause partition. Since I became a revolutionary, I have always been fearless of intimidation. Therefore, holding a meeting in Shanghai and not going to Nanjing is not a problem and has no value for research. In Shanghai, there is still room for the expression of free will. How can we save the country and remove internal troubles and foreign enemies if we go to Nanjing? This level should be replied to Mr. Shen. As for saying that the content of the Peace Conference is public, we have always not failed to make it public, except for a small part, which is not convenient to publish due to diplomatic relations. The rest can be seen in the newspapers every day. The diplomatic process is naturally the responsibility of the Nanjing government, because the Nanjing government has already been recognized internationally. The other diplomatic guidelines and principles will be discussed at this conference, and after a decision is made, it will be handed over to the Nanjing government for implementation. When it comes to facing the national crisis together, of course, we are originally intending to do so. How can we come to Shanghai if we do not seek to face the difficulties together? However, to face the national crisis together, we must also find a way. When we were in Guangdong, we had already said to the people of all circles that we only wanted to find a way for us to die. Should we call Guangdong to send troops to resist Japan? Can the troops pass through the areas under the rule of Nanjing? (This paragraph is roughly the same as the replies to the student and worker representatives, so it is omitted.) Therefore, the fundamental way to deal with foreign affairs is to establish a truly democratic government, and only then can we seek permanent peace in China and never have civil war again. If a democratic government cannot be established and democratic politics cannot be realized, then internal troubles and foreign enemies will be even worse in the future than they are now. Therefore, like the government of the Northern warlords in the past, we certainly want to overthrow it. Like the current Nanjing government, we also express our dissatisfaction in the same way. Because we are dissatisfied, we demand reorganization in order to truly implement political tutelage and establish democracy. Then internal troubles and foreign enemies can be permanently eliminated. How can the current situation of the unification of politics, military, and party be able to eliminate internal troubles and foreign enemies? Since the 18th year, there have been two foreign troubles: the incident on the Middle East Railway, which was confused, casually started a war, and then casually made peace; the second foreign trouble is the current incident in the three northeastern provinces. May I ask, under the current government, the people do not even have the freedom to say a few words about diplomacy. What other way is there to deal with foreign affairs? Therefore, if a government of democracy is not established, internal troubles and foreign enemies cannot be eliminated. Just taking the words of internal troubles and foreign enemies cannot intimidate me. I must use blood to seek the realization of democratic politics and use blood to seek the birth of a democratic government. I am a revolutionary and have long forgotten the existence of life. But perhaps I will say radical things today and go to Nanjing tomorrow, or I will even work together with Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. But I only seek the realization of a democratic government. I am willing to be a small clerk in this government, and I am willing to do so. Freedom of will is endowed by heaven. If there is no opportunity to exercise freedom of will, then it is uncertain whether I will go abroad tomorrow. Regarding my humble opinion, please enlighten me, gentlemen of the intellectual world. If you have anything else to teach me, I am very welcome. (End)</p>

<p>▲Two Important Letters from the Anti-Japanese Association</p>
<p>▲Stop Tobacco Exchange Merchants from Trading with Japanese: The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to the Tobacco Exchange Merchants Association yesterday, saying: "To the Director: According to confidential reports, the tobacco exchange industry in this port is still trading with the Japanese. Please investigate," etc. After this association dispatched personnel for investigation, it was reported that, upon investigation, the exchange of money and goods between the tobacco exchange industry and the Japanese did exist. However, when asked at various businesses, they all denied knowing anything or firmly denied it. This is because these matters are temporary transactions and there is no way to prove them," etc. Accordingly, we hereby send a letter to your association, asking you to instruct all tobacco exchange merchants to resolutely refuse to trade with the Japanese. We sincerely solicit your cooperation.</p>
<p>Addressed to: Tobacco Exchange Industry Association</p>
<p>▲Warning to Rice Merchants Providing Rice and Grain to the Japanese: The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to various rice shops yesterday, saying: "To the Director: According to confidential reports, Yongshenglong, Shengyuan, Shengsheng, Taisheng, Changsheng, etc., are all providing rice and grain to the Japanese. Please investigate," etc. After this association dispatched personnel, the investigation proved it to be true, according to the report on file. Accordingly, the violent Japanese have taken advantage of our disasters and invaded our borders, disregarding humanity, reaching an extreme point. If we continue to provide the enemy with grain, we will not only destroy the economic severance of relations, but also nurture a tiger and cause future trouble. According to the reported situation, we hereby send a strict warning to end the supply within a deadline.</p>
<p>Addressed to: Yongshenglong, Shengyuan, Jinsheng, Yusheng, Yuansheng, Shengsheng, Taisheng, Changsheng, and other rice shops</p>

<p>The Shanghai YMCA Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association urgently telegraphed: "To be reviewed by the Nanjing National Government, the provincial governments, all organizations, all institutions, all schools, and all newspapers: The Japanese have long coveted the Northeast, nibbling at China, and actively preparing for war. They have used threats to seize Taiwan, forcibly occupy Dalian, and compel us to sign the Twenty-One Demands of the fourth year of the Republic. They have used deception to collude with warlords, incite internal strife, and their methods are extremely vicious and cruel, arousing the indignation of both humans and gods. Yet, our government and people are blind to this, focusing on petty gains and losses, and making no substantial preparations for self-defense. As the enemy's arrogance intensifies, we rely only on slogans and banners to resist. When violence arrives, we order our soldiers to surrender and disarm as if that is the way to resist the enemy. How can a nation founded on such principles escape natural selection? The brutal Japanese invasion is escalating, with troops approaching the capital and demanding treaties under the city walls. The national situation is critical, and survival is uncertain. Yet, the officials in charge in the North and South still hesitate and make empty pronouncements on paper, without offering any practical methods to save the country. Do they believe that the party and the nation can be separated, and that the party can survive even if the nation perishes? As citizens, our association witnesses the imminent national crisis and the danger of the entire nation drowning. In addition to following the lead of other patriotic conferences and urging the government to quickly unify the country and prepare for defense, we have resolved to issue the following six proposals regarding the Japanese military's violent actions. We ask the nation to review them: (1) The people of the entire nation, regardless of party affiliation, should concentrate talent and unite to resist the enemy. (2) Anyone who exploits the national crisis for personal gain should be considered a public enemy of the nation. (3) No one is allowed to conclude secret treaties with Japan that would cede rights and humiliate the country. Violators will be charged with treason. (4) We insist on opposing direct negotiations until the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn. (5) The government's diplomacy with Japan should be based on the will of the people and should announce its policies publicly. (6) Actively prepare our strength to wash away national humiliation. The Shanghai YMCA Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association bows in respect."</p>
<h3 id="e143">▲ The City Federation Thoroughly Inspects Japanese Goods <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Members of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation Inspection Committee for Japanese Goods, including Zhang Yichen, Wang Zhaocheng, Zhou Fuzhang, Liu Zhongying, Lin Yangzhi, and Wu Ban'an, have organized inspection teams in various districts. Since their departure, shops throughout the city have welcomed them. It is estimated that Japanese goods worth over ten million yuan, accounting for nine-tenths of the total, have already been confiscated. The remaining small portion that has not been confiscated is being urgently expedited by the various branch offices to complete the work, in order to fulfill the responsibility of resisting Japan and saving the country. Furthermore, considering that areas such as Avenue Edward VII and Minlu are places where Japanese goods frequently appear, in order to clarify the source and sever economic ties with Japan, it has been decided through a meeting to limit the time for each branch office to complete its work, to uphold the spirit of our nation, and to hope to complete the inspection as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee of this city issued a circular yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern: The terms 'Manchuria,' 'Man-Mongolia,' 'South Manchuria,' and 'North Manchuria' are designations used by the Japanese to influence our Eastern Provinces, intending to divide our Northeast from the central provinces, undermine the spirit of unity among the five ethnic groups, and achieve their continental northward expansion policy. Nationals, without being aware, have followed suit, referring to the Three Eastern Provinces as 'Man-Mongolia' or 'Manchuria,' which is highly inappropriate. Hereafter, the Three Eastern Provinces should be uniformly referred to by the names Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, to clarify the situation, avoid falling into their trap, and we hope that you will follow this procedure."</p>

<p>▲ Labor and management are not allowed to propose new conditions.</p>
<p>▲ Labor is not allowed to strike or engage in sabotage.</p>
<p>▲ Management is not allowed to dismiss workers without authorization.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, and Tao Baichuan, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee, and Zhang, Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government, jointly issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Regarding the issuance of this notice, this government has received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry stating that in this time of national crisis, all our countrymen should work together with one heart and await the government's measures. Workers in all areas should strive to produce and overcome difficulties together. All labor disputes should be quickly coordinated, and strikes and sabotage should be strictly prevented. It is hoped that subordinate officials will follow this order and instruct all labor and management organizations to comply. With this approval, this committee and government have jointly agreed on the following three temporary measures to cease disputes between labor and management during this period: (1) All agreements already signed between labor and management should continue to be maintained, and both parties are not allowed to propose new conditions. (2) Except for closures or reductions in the scope of labor due to unavoidable circumstances, management should report to the competent authorities for approval before dismissing workers without authorization. (3) Labor is not allowed to strike or engage in sabotage. If labor or management violate the above, the responsible personnel will be severely punished without leniency. In addition to this committee ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct all labor and management organizations to comply, this joint notice is hereby issued to inform the public and to urge everyone to understand the difficulties of the time, earnestly comply, and not violate this order, so as to avoid any inconvenience. This notice is urgent."</p>

<p>▲ The Xin Jiangtian Experiences Japanese Goods Turmoil: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Jiangtian, on its recent trip from Shanghai to Ningbo, was found to have its teahouse staff and others privately transporting over two hundred and twenty pieces of Japanese salted fish, worth over six thousand yuan. Upon arriving in Ningbo, the goods were unloaded at the dock, at which point a Japanese goods inspection committee privately allowed them to pass. Cold water vendors and workers at the dock were greatly dissatisfied, gathering a crowd of five to six hundred people who tied up the inspectors Xu Zhen and Li He, and twenty others, intending to parade them through the streets. Patrol Captain Wu Zhenhua and others arrived to mediate, releasing the two inspectors Xu and Li. Xu and others fled into the China Merchants Bureau, where bureau staff hid the two and locked the iron gate, which aroused public outrage and the intention to destroy the gate. The turmoil escalated, and the security team dispatched two squads of soldiers to persuade them to desist, promising to hand over the two inspectors to the Public Security Bureau, and to submit the two hundred and twenty pieces of Japanese salted fish to the China Merchants Bureau's 228 warehouse for storage, pending public judgment. Only then did the matter come to a conclusion. Xu and Li, the two inspectors, were injured from being dragged and beaten by the crowd.</p>
<p>▲ No News of the Xin Ning Arriving: The Xin Ninghai, which travels between Ningbo and Ninghai, was attacked on the 3rd of this month at 6:00 AM, sailing through the waters of Xiashan Xue'ao. Over twenty pirates, disguised as farmers and carrying bamboo baskets containing handguns and other weapons, boarded the ship. This was discovered by Lin Yaofu, the ship's security team leader, who tried to prevent them from boarding. The bandits fired three shots, hitting his legs and chest, causing him to fall into a small boat and escape to Haining for medical treatment, but he died. The Xin Ninghai was commandeered by the bandits and sailed north, with over twenty passengers, thirty sailors, and many other crew members all kidnapped. Three days have passed and there is still no news. Although the Outer Sea Hall has dispatched warships to pursue, there is still no news to this day.</p>
<h3 id="e149">British Goods, Yarn, and Raw Materials: The Visitors' Bureau Can Provide Guidance for Ordering <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Superior to Japanese Goods, Definitely Not Unsuitable</p>
<p>Nationals, in light of Japan's atrocities, are voluntarily severing economic ties with Japan and refusing to import Japanese raw materials. The silk dyeing industry in this city and others are experiencing a raw material panic. The trade association has petitioned the competent authorities for permission to appropriately reduce the number of workers. The Ministry of Industry, believing that this would harm workers' livelihoods and industrial production, did not approve. Yarn and raw materials can also be replaced with British goods. The Ministry of Industry instructed the trade association to comply promptly and stated that the request to dismiss workers or close factories should not be considered. However, the silk dyeing and weaving industry believes there are practical difficulties and requested remedies. According to news from the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Visitors' Bureau, after receiving the order from the Ministry of Industry, the bureau immediately convened various industrial circles to discuss solutions. Regarding yarn and raw materials, although there is currently a large quantity of coarse yarn, the 42-count thread that is usually used can be replaced with 20-count yarn. Furthermore, there is a large stock of two-ply thread produced in Manchester, England, which can also be used as a substitute. If you are unfamiliar with the ordering procedures, the bureau can provide guidance. Moreover, the British raw materials are better than the Japanese goods and will definitely not be unsuitable. If smaller factories do not have the ability to place orders, they may consider placing joint orders, or have the trade association place orders on their behalf. The goods can be shipped to Shanghai approximately one month after ordering. There are already quite a few people who have placed orders.</p>

<h3 id="e151">▲ Regular Meeting of the Provincial Flood Disaster Emergency Relief Association <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Provincial Flood Disaster Emergency Relief Association held its fifteenth regular meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Those in attendance were Xu Shiying, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Ye Kaixin, Li Zizhong, Mao Youfeng, Huang Bodu, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin (represented by Li Zhi'an), Zhang Zhijiang (represented by Weng Guoxun), Wang Yiting, Ha Shaofu, Wu Yunzhai, Li Zuyu, Qi Zhongdao, Gong Jin (representative from Qinghai), Xu Zhixuan, Huang Dingxun, and others. Xu Shiying chaired the meeting and Yang Yunzhen took the minutes. The matters discussed were: (1) Regarding the proposal to publicly appoint general directors of winter emergency relief in various regions in accordance with the association's relief regulations, it was resolved that Feng Yangshan would be appointed for Henan, Zhao Youqin for Hunan, Zhou Baipeng for Jiangxi, Wang Yiting for Zhejiang, Zhang Shaotang for Shandong, Cui Xianlou for Gansu and Shaanxi, Xu Pingxuan for central Anhui, and Zhai Zhancheng for southern Anhui. (2) Regarding the proposal that the association should add one standing committee member to each of the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Henan, where the disaster situation is particularly severe, to handle affairs in order to ensure progress, it was resolved that Ye Kaixin would be appointed for Hunan, Guan Jiongzhi for Hubei, Hu Youyu for Jiangxi, and Li Zhizhong for Henan, and that this would be submitted to the general assembly for ratification. (3) Zhang Shaotang, Shandong's relief commissioner, stated that the current distribution would require approximately 13,000 yuan, with a remaining 27,000 yuan. It seemed appropriate to select areas with severe disasters and appropriately increase subsidies for seeds and farming tools, or to use all 27,000 yuan to establish two or three porridge kitchens near Jinan, so that disaster victims who had fled elsewhere could avoid freezing and starvation. It was resolved that the porridge kitchens had already been organized by the Red Swastika Society, and the association could appropriately provide seeds and farming tools, but not subsidies. (4) The Shanghai Office of the Relief Committee forwarded a letter from Xu Pingxuan, the association's central Anhui relief commissioner, outlining a winter relief plan budget for 15 counties, including Huaining. The plan estimated that there were over 3.9 million disaster victims, and distributing 20% of the relief funds would require over 780,000 yuan, while providing clothing would require over 390,000 sets of cotton clothes. How should this be reviewed and responded to? It was resolved to hand it over to the general director of central Anhui for review and handling. (5) The Shanghai Office of the Relief Committee forwarded a letter from Xu Pingxuan, the association's central Anhui relief commissioner and representative, stating that winter relief should select areas with severe disasters and appropriately establish nine porridge kitchens for review and handling. It was resolved to handle it in conjunction with the above item. (6) Zhu Ziqiao received a telegram from the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Affairs Association stating that the weather was cold and flood victims were living outdoors, which was very tragic. The association was planning to establish shelters to provide relief and requested a quick allocation of relief funds for implementation. It was resolved to allocate 3% of the relief funds. (7) Wang Tingrui, director of the Qinghai Office in Beijing, telegraphed that the province's relief funds should be handed over to Qi Zhongdao to carry to Qinghai for distribution. It was resolved that the association and Qi Jun should first telegraph the Qinghai Provincial Government to inquire about the handling. (8) According to reports, the Shanghai shelter for disaster victims was planning to be disbanded by the municipal government, which was very pitiful. Should efforts be made to rescue it? (9) The Shanghai Municipal Office for the Reception of Disaster Victims requested an additional allocation of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan to subsidize its maintenance. It was resolved to handle it in conjunction with the previous item and to appoint Ye Kaixin, Qu Wenliu, and Zhu Ziqiao as three representatives to attend a joint meeting of five charitable organizations to jointly plan and handle it. (10) Regarding the date of the executive committee meeting for this month, it was resolved to hold it next Saturday, November 14th, at the association. (11) Qu Wenliu proposed contacting the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and requested the appointment of representatives. It was resolved to appoint Zhang Xiaolin, Li Zuyu, and Pan Xulun as three representatives to go and contact them. Furthermore, the association had previously contacted Xu Pingxuan, the relief commissioner of central Anhui, via telegram to discuss winter relief matters, and Mr. Xu had arrived in Shanghai yesterday and reported on the progress of the central Anhui relief efforts and the detailed plans for winter relief.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Five Groups Plan to Take Over the Reception of Disaster Victims <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Office for the Reception of Disaster Victims, due to the fact that the flood disaster in Jiangbei has not receded and various places have stopped receiving disaster victims, resulting in disaster victims flocking to Shanghai, and for the sake of international image and public security and hygiene, is planning to repatriate disaster victims to their hometowns. Five charitable organizations, including the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Shanghai Provincial Flood Disaster Emergency Relief Association, the Red Cross Society, the Charitable Organizations Joint Association, and the Jiangsu Flood Disaster Relief Association, held separate meetings yesterday. They all agreed that winter was approaching and that disaster victims returning to their hometowns would be facing concerns about clothing and food. To save lives and solve the problem thoroughly, the five groups planned to take over the reception. At the same time, they still requested assistance from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Health Bureau to facilitate the process. They also planned for each group to appoint three people to convene a joint meeting on the 11th of the month (next Wednesday) to discuss how to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="e153">What Did Bandits Want with a Rented Car? <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chauffeur Tied Up in an Attic Room</p>
<p>▲ Job Completed in 45 Minutes</p>
<p>▲ Purpose of Car Rental Unclear</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at the Xiafei Motor Company on Route Lafayette in the French Concession, a bandit disguised as a customer came to rent a car. As a result, the chauffeur was tied up in a bandit den. By the afternoon, the car was found near the French Garden. However, the true purpose remains unknown. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Hired to Pick Up a Patient: Yan Hongru, a 42-year-old man from Yangzhou, who invested in the Xiafei Motor Company at 744-746 Route Lafayette in the French Concession, was managing a passable business. At 9:55 AM yesterday morning, an uninvited customer wearing a dark gray gabardine jacket, a light gray felt hat, and speaking in a Cantonese accent came and claimed his name was Wu Zhenhua. He said he needed to rent a car to pick up a patient at 321 Route Doumer and take them to a hospital on North Szechuan Road.</p>
<p>▲ Ordered to Stop Midway: After agreeing to a rental price of $1.50, to be paid after the job was completed, the company's bookkeeper ordered Li Shiqi, a chauffeur from Yangzhou with driver's license number 9104, to drive out in a new Chrysler bridge-style car with license plate number 12495, purchased from the Global Motor Company less than two weeks ago. The uninvited guest sat in the car and headed west. The car drove past Avenue Albert and approached the entrance of the Yiyu Alley near Rue Massenet, when the uninvited guest suddenly ordered the car to stop.</p>
<p>▲ Chauffeur Deceived: After the car stopped at the entrance of Yiyu Alley, the uninvited guest jumped out of the car and asked the chauffeur to accompany him inside to help carry the patient down. The chauffeur also got out of the car and entered the main alley, turned into the first narrow alley, and went straight to the attic room on the third floor through the second back door. As soon as the chauffeur entered the room, he noticed that there was only a bed in the west corner, covered with an old quilt, and nothing else. There were four strong men already inside. As soon as they saw the chauffeur, one of them suddenly pulled out a gun and forbade him from making any noise. The uninvited customer then exited and went downstairs. The chauffeur heard the engine start, as the car had been temporarily "borrowed."</p>
<p>▲ Bandits Fled in Disorder: The men tied the chauffeur's hands behind his back with rope, tightly gagged his mouth with a handkerchief, pushed him onto the bed, and wrapped him in a red blanket. The men then went downstairs together, leaving one person to guard him. After about 45 minutes, the men returned. One of them locked the door from the outside and told the chauffeur not to make any noise, saying that the car would be parked near the French Garden soon and he could find it by address. They then fled in disorder. No one was seen in the direction the car left. After struggling for a long time, the chauffeur managed to untie himself.</p>
<p>▲ Escaped Through Window and Down a Ladder: After the chauffeur untied himself, he looked out the window and called for help. A plasterer happened to have a tall ladder set up near the back door to decorate the walls. The chauffeur, in desperation, climbed out the window and down the ladder, then went around to the front door and learned that it was the Gongxinxie Kee Fresh Fruit Store at 1239 Route Lafayette. He told the store owner about his dangerous experience, but the owner was completely unaware. The chauffeur rushed to report to the Lou-za Police Station, but because the incident took place on Rue Chapsal, he hired a rickshaw to go to Rue Chapsal to report.</p>
<p>▲ The Rental of the House: After hearing the news, the captain immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. According to the fruit store owner, Zhou Boting from Ningbo, the store had just opened the day before yesterday. On the evening of the 4th of this month, two men speaking in a Cantonese accent came and said they were studying at a certain school. They rented the attic room, stating that the monthly rent would be nine yuan and paying a deposit of two yuan. Last night (the previous night), they moved in a bed and said that the rental would start on the 6th and that their older brother would act as a guarantor when the time came. Late that night, three or four more men came. As for everything that happened to the chauffeur upstairs this morning, he had no knowledge because he was on the third floor and the distance was too far.</p>
<p>▲ The Original Car Was Indeed Found: After the chauffeur, accompanied by the detectives, went to investigate, he immediately returned to the company to describe the situation. The company immediately sent several people to search for the car in the French Garden area. By the time they reached the area near Avenue Haig, they indeed saw the car parked by the side of the road. They then reported to the police station. The captain ordered them to drive the car back first and wait for further investigation. However, as of tonight, no kidnapping cases have occurred in the Chinese or French concessions.</p>
<h3 id="e154">New House Collapse in Caojiadu: Fatalities and Injuries <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲ Three Men and Women Crushed to Death</p>
<p>▲ Two Injured</p>
<p>At around 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, a newly built building in the Lushuezhai area of Caojiadu in western Shanghai suddenly collapsed completely, resulting in the tragic deaths of three men and women and injuries to two others. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ New Building: Chen Genlin, who lived in Dujiazha, Caojiadu, western Shanghai, had a piece of ancestral land in the Lushuezhai area. The Longjinjie Construction Company contracted to build a three-story building in the previous month. Since construction began, it had been over a month. All the work had to be carried out in accordance with the plans approved by the Works Bureau. The project was 80% complete, with the roof recently finished and the finishing work in progress.</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Collapse: The owner of the construction company, Mr. Long, eager to receive payment, had the roof built before the wall construction was completed, resulting in a top-heavy structure. At 4:00 PM on the day before yesterday, while the workers were working, the building collapsed with a loud crash, shaking the surroundings. The villagers in the area were shocked and fled in panic. The neighboring thatched sheds were also crushed, and five residents were buried under the bricks and tiles, all of whom managed to escape. For a time, dust filled the air, blurring vision.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Tragedy: Next to the building was a thatched shed rented by a Mr. Zhang from Jiangbei. The lease had expired last year, and the landlord had repeatedly urged him to move, but Mr. Zhang had repeatedly delayed. It was only now that the tragedy occurred. After the incident, villagers came forward to rescue, removing the bricks and tiles. They found an elderly woman, Ms. Chen (the wife of Mr. Zhang Changyou, 64 years old), and a woman, Ms. Zhang (the daughter of the elderly woman, 46 years old). Both were covered in blood and their brains had been shattered, a truly tragic sight. They had already died. There were also one man and two women injured. The man, Cao Yifu, 24 years old, was a worker hired by the factory. His injuries were severe and he was immediately taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. He died early yesterday morning due to his injuries. The two women, one surnamed Wang and one surnamed Tang, were both around 20 years old and from Jiangbei. They were also taken to the hospital for treatment, and it is said that their lives are not in danger.</p>
<p>▲ Aftermath: After the tragedy occurred, the head of the Sixth District Police Station, Director Ren, was notified and immediately sent police officers to rescue and investigate the cause of the collapse. He arrested Wu Xinquan, the accountant of the construction company, Long Fangshi, the wife of the factory owner, and Han Yongru, the guarantor, for further investigation. However, the factory owner, Mr. Long, had already fled without a trace. Later, it was learned that the son of the deceased, Mr. Zhang Shuxiang, had met with misfortune and was responsible for the delay in moving. The factory owner had also fled without a trace. He volunteered to prepare coffins for burial, so the bodies were collected yesterday afternoon. It is rumored that the cause of the collapse was that the factory owner had saved on materials and reduced labor, and had not followed the approved plans.</p>

<p>▲ Switchman Temporarily Detained</p>
<p>According to Mr. Guo Chengen, Director of the Railways Bureau, the Zhenru train crash was investigated by officials sent by the Ministry of Railways a few days ago. The switchman and the stationmaster who were responsible have been dismissed and the switchman has been detained. As for how to handle the matter, since officials from the Ministry have come to investigate, it should be left to the Ministry to handle. The Railways Bureau is very sorry for the injured passengers and has sent staff to the hospital to express condolences several times. As for the rumor that a certain injured lawyer has filed a lawsuit, the bureau has not heard of it. According to precedent, the railways have never issued compensation or pensions in train crashes. Regarding the railway staff's pension, half of it has already been issued and the rest will be issued soon.</p>
<h3 id="e156">American Missionary Vincent Murdered <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Continental News received a telegram the night before last from Missionary White, a visitor from Suqian, stating that Vincent, an American missionary of the Southern Presbyterian Church, had been murdered by bandits near Haizhou. The details are unknown. Two other places in Shanghai also received similar telegrams. This information was immediately conveyed to the American Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Cunningham, who telegraphed Mr. Packer, the American Consul General in Nanjing, requesting him to notify the National Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government. According to reports, Missionary Vincent was kidnapped by bandits on October 21st, 30 miles southeast of Haizhou. The missionary had been in China for 24 years and was 51 years old. He had served in Suqian and Haizhou for many years. His wife had died early and he had three children, all of whom are studying in the United States. According to the Shanghai Evening Post, the American Consul General, Mr. Cunningham, received a telegram from Zhenjiang stating that the remains of Missionary Vincent had been recovered from the bandits and handed over to the church. The funeral is scheduled to be held in Haizhou on the 7th.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Second Lottery Held for Downtown Land <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲Registration Ended at the End of Last Month, Lottery Held on the 10th for Allotment</p>
<p>▲City Land Bureau Currently Preparing for Third Call for Applications</p>
<p>The first call for applications for land in the city's downtown area was enthusiastically completed last month. The areas originally designated for city government employees and others were not successfully allotted. Therefore, the city government re-designated the downtown area for a second round of applications, which ended at the end of last month. A lottery for allotment will be held on the morning of the 10th of this month. According to statistics from the bureau yesterday, the second designated allotment area comprises 459 mu. After deducting 16 mu claimed by the original owners with priority rights, 443 mu remain. In this round, 101 mu have been registered for by various parties, leaving 342 mu. The Land Bureau has obtained approval from the city government to hold a third call for applications. The registration date is set from the 11th of this month (the day after the second registrants' lottery) to the 25th of this month, with the lottery for allotment set for the 1st of next month. According to the bureau's statement to the New Voice News Agency reporter, the third call for applications is expected to be more enthusiastic than the second. This is because the second call stipulated that each person could only purchase one mu of land, while the third call allows each person to purchase two mu or one mu. Generally, purchasers prefer to buy large tracts of land rather than small plots, so it is expected to be more popular than the second. Furthermore, the city government had designated 209 mu of land in the city center for government employees. After deducting 18 mu reclaimed by the original owners with priority rights, city government employees claimed 96 mu in the second call for applications, leaving over 90 mu. The disposition method for this land has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, rumors circulated yesterday that the Public Concession Tram Company would sell unified capital tickets. According to a responsible statement from Mr.茂爾, the head of the company's inspection department, the company has absolutely no such intention. The rumors circulating yesterday are entirely untrue.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Rent Increase Resolved in Baoyu Lane <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The German Hehe Foreign Firm, landlord of Baoyu Lane on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, previously distributed notices to each household proposing a uniform 30% rent increase from the 11th of this month. The tenants, feeling unable to bear the increased burden in these difficult times, jointly agreed to establish the Tenants' Association (now renamed the French Concession Baoyu Lane Tenants' Association) and elected Yao Zhaoji, Ding Shunhua, Yao Shouren, Zhang Ziquan, Yao Wenqing, Wang Ziliang, Mo Qichang, Tang Yinyuan, Wang Yanchun, Zhou Fengshan, and ten others as executive committee members. They sent two official letters to the manager of Hehe Foreign Firm requesting the cancellation of the rent increase. After repeated negotiations between the committee members and Mr. Chen Guansheng, the representative of Hehe Foreign Firm, an agreement was reached to cancel the 30% rent increase. The postponement is extended to May of next year. Starting then, each building along the main road and in the lane will have a uniform monthly rent increase of five yuan. Yesterday, the rental agent dispatched by Hehe Foreign Firm signed leases with each household.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Arresting a Bandit with a Cigarette <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>▲Extortionist waved his hand into his pocket</p>
<p>▲Seemingly indicating possession of a handgun</p>
<p>▲Forced to use his right hand to accept the cigarette</p>
<p>▲Detectives then swarmed in and apprehended him</p>
<p>Zhu Jinsheng, a local resident and owner of the Zhu Xingji clothing store at 454 Route Ferguson in western Shanghai, suddenly received a threatening letter from bandits on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month. Upon opening it, a bullet was enclosed. The letter contained threatening language, intending to extort 3,000 yuan. It also stipulated that a room be booked at the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road on the afternoon of the 5th, with the name "Zhu Lansheng" on the sign, and someone would come to negotiate. Zhu reported the letter to the Xinzha detention center. The police chief ordered detectives Ruan Yao, Bao Chen Yaoting, and Yang Xinzheng to disguise themselves and accompany Zhu Jinsheng and his accountant Zhao Bing to the Dongya Hotel on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. They booked room 404, with the name "Zhu Lansheng" written outside. Zhu was instructed to stay inside alone, while the others lay in ambush nearby. At 4:30 PM, the bandit gang first called to inquire. Zhao Bing answered, stating that he was a small businessman with limited funds and urging them to come quickly to negotiate. The bandits agreed to arrive within twenty minutes. At around 5:00 PM, a bandit named Fang Shulin from Shanghai entered the room, with his left hand inserted into his pocket, indicating that he seemingly possessed a handgun. He asked Zhu if he had brought the money. Zhu, fearing his weapon, did not dare to act rashly and offered him a cigarette. Fang had no choice but to extend his right hand to accept it. At that moment, the detectives swarmed into the room and apprehended Fang. Fang confessed that a certain Zhou was his accomplice and was waiting in front of the Yile Tian Teahouse. The detectives took Fang Shulin with them, but Zhou had already fled. However, Zhao Gengsheng was apprehended at the entrance of the Wing On Company and taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the case and requested a postponement. Zhu Jinsheng and witness Zhao Bing also testified to prove everything. Fang Shulin confessed that he delivered the threatening letter, but Zhou wrote it. Yesterday, Zhou instructed him to go to the Dongya Hotel to collect the money. Zhao Gengsheng confessed that he knew Zhou and met him in Yanziwo yesterday afternoon. Zhou instructed him to go to Nanjing Road to find Fang Shulin. He was arrested in front of the Wing On Company while Zhou escaped. Judge Wu Yanqi verified the confessions and ordered the two defendants to be detained pending a retrial in seven days.</p>

First, Chairman Ms. Yang Meizhen gave the opening speech, and the entire group sang the temperance song.

Mr. Feng's speech stated in essence that after seeing the work of various departments of the center and Ms. Liu Wang Liming's report, he was extremely impressed by the achievements made with an annual budget of less than 4,000 gold.

<h3 id="e166">Anti-Drug Association Receives Numerous Reports of Severe Opium Poppy Cultivation in Fujian <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has received dozens of letters and telegrams from various sources in southern Fujian, reporting on the cultivation of opium poppies in various counties of Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Xinghua, and Yongchun. Most of these postal communications have been detained by local authorities, causing delays, which is regrettable. According to a report from Xiamen, opium seedlings have already sprouted in the three prefectures of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xinghua, some growing to five or six inches. It is said that the key figures behind this are all influential individuals. Zhangzhou can collect 3 million yuan in taxes, Quanzhou can collect 5 million yuan, and Xinghua has already planted 50,000 mu. The distribution of profits has also been agreed upon. Lin Yushi, a member of the Fujian Opium Prohibition Committee, has always been enthusiastic about opium prohibition and is strongly opposed to this large-scale planting of opium seedlings. He has joined all the members of the Opium Prohibition Committee in resigning from the provincial government to demonstrate their determination. According to a report from Quanzhou, an airfield is currently being constructed in Quanzhou to facilitate the export of opium by air. In the future, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou can utilize airplanes to export opium, which can be considered a new method of opium trafficking. Opium paste sales have already been implemented in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and Xiamen will also be holding them soon. It is reported that the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and various groups in Fujian will have a serious response to this matter.</p>

<p>According to Shenshi News, there was a negligence incident in the cotton cleaning room of Shenxin No. 2 Cotton Mill on Yichang Road on the 22nd of last month. The workers all rushed to escape, resulting in six female workers being trampled to death. The police alleged that the emergency exit set up by the cotton mill was not opened in accordance with the regulations and that there was suspicion of negligence. Therefore, the First Special District Court was prosecuted for negligence of duty resulting in death and injury. The Special Court approved the filing and placed Zhu Xianfang, the manager of the cotton mill, and Zhang Yiming, the supervisor, under detention and bail for questioning. Yesterday morning, the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court conducted an interrogation. First, Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, presented the details of the investigation of the case. Zhu and Zhang, the two defendants, retained lawyers Wang Fushang and Wu Linkun for defense. They argued that at the time of the fire in the cotton mill, the emergency exit was directly in the path of the fire, and there were concerns that sparks would fly into the cotton room and spread the fire, so it was temporarily closed. Moreover, the female workers did not die in the fire, but were trampled on by other workers rushing to escape, causing the disaster. Therefore, it can be known that the death of the deceased was unrelated to the closure of the emergency exit, and there was no negligence. Various female workers also testified to this effect. Judge Feng Shide impartially investigated the situation and concluded that the case was debated. The court declared not guilty on the spot and released the defendants.</p>

<p>(20,000 Return Home, Losses Exceed 20 Million Yuan)</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the tragic incident, many compatriots residing in Korea have been returning home expeditiously. Recently, with the outbreak of the Northeast Incident, out of concern for safety, no fewer than 20,000 compatriots have been returning to China one after another. In their departure, they have all abandoned their assets and returned alone. Years of hard work have been swept away. Only a few remain, but their assets have been depleted, leaving them in a position where they want to leave but cannot, and want to stay but cannot. The reason is that, over the years, they have extended considerable credit. In these times, Koreans are stubbornly refusing to pay, believing that war is imminent and that compatriots will inevitably leave sooner or later. Real estate cannot be sold, only abandoned. Movable property can be sold, but after clearing debts, there is no remaining money left to sustain life. Business is sluggish due to the distress of the Koreans, and the situation is unspeakable. Consuls in various places do not observe the actual situation of the overseas Chinese, only offering protection, but what use is protection in reality? In short, the total loss of assets of the overseas Chinese should be over 20 million yuan. Among the overseas Chinese merchants, those from Jiaodong in Shandong are the most numerous. It is unknown what methods compatriots have to save them.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Today, I read in your esteemed newspaper that the 15th meeting of the Anti-Japanese Association decided to exempt Korean ginseng from the boycott, and the resolution was approved with a plan to be drafted by the Secretariat. After reading this, I was greatly astonished. If such unnecessary items can be exempted from the boycott, then the word "boycott" can be ignored, and there is nothing left to boycott. I have been doing business in Korea and Japan for a long time and am very familiar with the production and sales of Korean ginseng. I dare to present the following to the nation: Korean ginseng is produced in Kaesong, Korea. Since the annexation of Korea by Japan, the Governor-General's Office has established a special ginseng monopoly bureau. The ginseng sold to China is entirely manufactured by the monopoly bureau, which collects a monopoly tax of over one million taels annually. It is then exclusively sold by Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese conglomerate. Shanghai is the largest market. After Mitsui &amp; Co. ships it to China, it is further distributed by the four major firms on Xian Gua Street: Fuchang, Dechang, Baoda, and Yuanchang. The price of Korean ginseng is extremely low in Korea. The Governor-General's Office buys it from the locals for only 18 yuan per catty. After passing through several hands, the retail price is over 100 taels per catty. Approximately 50,000 catties are sold to China annually, resulting in an annual loss of about 5-6 million taels for our country. Even in normal times, the government should increase taxes or even ban imports of such trivial items, considering the significant financial loss. Moreover, in the present circumstances, there is even less reason to allow imports. The officials of the Anti-Japanese Association believe that they should sympathize with the Korean petition. However, they may not know that the Korean Chamber of Commerce is entirely a Japanese commercial organization, with only a few Koreans as mere decorations. If they consider that the owner of Korean ginseng is the Governor-General's Office monopoly bureau, and the seller is Mitsui &amp; Co., with no connection to Koreans at all, then there is no reason for them to petition. I sincerely hope that the directors and supervisors of the Anti-Japanese Association will not be exploited by the enemy. This is my earnest prayer. Zhang Baonian, 686 Furen Lane, South Chengdu Road, November 4th.</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>In your newspaper's shipping news column on the 6th of this month, there was a news item about the resignation of the head of the shipping department, stating that Zeng and Li took turns holding the position and that Li resigned voluntarily. These details are completely untrue. Mr. Zeng Guangqing had already been transferred to the position of head of the business department, and Mr. Li Yuncheng was solely responsible for the shipping department. There was no resignation. This is based on inaccurate information. I hope your newspaper will promptly make a correction. Addressed to: Shen Bao Newspaper Office, General Administration of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company under the National Government, November 6th.</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I read yesterday's local news column in your esteemed newspaper, "Yu Qiaqing Discusses Shipping Bonds," which stated that Yu Qiaqing told people that the funds would be used to establish a shipping bank with five million yuan and allocate five million yuan to various Chinese shipping companies. These are not facts. The Ministry of Finance is discussing and approving the issuance of these public bonds, and this is true. However, the sections stating that the plan was agreed upon by Yu Qiaqing and Minister Song, and the details of the allocation, are not true. I am writing this letter to inform you and hope that you will make a correction. Addressed to: Shen Bao Local News Editorial Department, Shanghai Shipping Association, November 6, 2011.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read in your newspaper that party members in Jiangsu Province were promoting the peaceful settlement of the Jiangxi telegrams, and my humble name was listed, which greatly surprised me. I have not been consulted or informed about this matter beforehand. Peaceful unification and joint resistance against foreign aggression are what the people of the country hope for. I especially hope that all parties will abandon their prejudices and not create rifts that would expose weaknesses and be ridiculed by foreign countries. The wording of this telegram places blame on Comrade Hu Hanmin, which could cause division within our party. This is not what I wish to say. It is clear that someone has fabricated the list and included my name. I am writing this special letter to correct this. With respectful greetings, Shen Bai, a party member from Changshu County.</p>

<p>The enemy forces between the Aisne and Meuse rivers were greatly shaken and soon began to retreat. On November 2nd, Bussancy and Doulcon were successively captured. On the 3rd, the northern part of the Argonne was completely cleared, and the heights of Belval were also occupied. The army on the left bank of the Meuse River advanced to Thennes. On the 4th, French and American forces crossed Stonne and Le Chesne, invaded the forest south of Bairon, advanced along the Meuse River, and approached Stonne.</p>
<p>I warmly congratulated Commander Pershing and asked him to continue his attack towards the Meuse River, advancing upstream from Barzun while exerting maximum effort to extend to the right bank.</p>
<p>A separate armistice agreement has been concluded between France and Austria, and Austrian troops have withdrawn from French territory. I had requested Commander Pershing to deploy the American Second Army for assistance several days ago. (To be continued)</p>
