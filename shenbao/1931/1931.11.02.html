<p>（三）中國政府欣悉日本政府堅决否認該國政府蓄意運用軍事壓力與中國相交涉惟中國政府以爲應指明如日本政府之看法果係如此則使其有效之唯一方法爲不再要求與中國先行商訂兩國將來全部關係之基本大綱作爲撤退軍隊之先决條件行政院之决議案及中國政府對於行政院之允諾已予日本軍隊撤退各地方日本僑民生命財產之安全以最廣大之保障欲圖此項保障及允諾之生效則惟有就地定出一種局部辦法隨日本軍隊撤退之程度同時並進正如白里安君在行政院中所云需時至多不過數日而已故此節與中日政府間外交上之會商逈不相同亦完全不生關係</p>
<p>（四）中國政府亦願使兩國間緊張之情勢可以從此永歸終止正與日本政府之願望相同並熱忱願意重建且改善其關係之基礎俾得保證永久和平及親善中國政府認爲達到此種目的之第一步在於遵從行政院之决議案惟在日本軍隊違反行政院之請求破壞國聯盟約第十條非戰公約第二條華府九國條約第一條之規定非法佔領中國土地時期以内則欲求兩國間良好關係或彼此從事會商均爲難能在此種情勢终止之時兩國然後可以以國際聯合會忠實會員之資格彼此同意開始奮力而消除其不良之印象中國政府以爲欲求近數星期來所受敎訓之利益欲收國際聯合會處理之效果欲防止危及遠東和平各爭端之再見其惟一方法在於如中國政府之提議設立永久調解機關以求和平並公正解决兩國間萬一之糾紛</p>
<p>中國政府須重爲說明者即現在先决問題爲日本軍隊應依照行政院决議案立即開始撤退而於十一月十六日前完成其撤退也</p>

<h3>無線電捕盜記</h3>
<p>— 乙未生</p>
<p>白柯南道爾氏之福爾摩斯偵探小說行世於是蘇格蘭塲之名遂爲世人所共知柯南道爾小說中之蘇格蘭塲雖屬稗官家言不免故神其說然實際上之蘇格蘭塲固亦非常機警敏捷以今日之蘇格蘭塲之活動而按之於柯南道爾當日所言亦未可謂爲過分的誇張也</p>
<p>蘇格蘭塲位於倫敦泰晤土河畔巨厦兩座作灰色凡六層所謂無線電捕盜之總樞紐即在此中此中無線電機無日無夜均有人栗六司其事凡罪案之報告以及指揮追捕悉出納於此機關中罪案一發此中立得報告三數分鐘内警戒逮捕之命令即出満佈全市之脚踏汽車警察即由無線電機中奉命而活動蓋倫敦盜匪多利用汽車以供掠刦後逃逸然機車警察一出則此輩無得倖免八閱月來破案達四百起·幾於無案不破自去年耶穌誔節至今破獲之路刦犯判定之徒刑其總和之刑期爲二百五十年云</p>
<p>警察捕盜之術精而盜匪自防之術亦巧數月前警察偵得似有一部份盜匪亦利用無線電機而截獲蘇格蘭塲發出之無線電故今蘇格蘭塲已不時變換其電波之短長使盜匪不易捉摸</p>
<p>自去年三月以來破獲之贓物珠還原主者爲値已達二十五萬金元之巨此種盜竊品中乃括有威士忌酒金銀器物貴重皮貨乃至紙菸</p>
<p>無線電機之室乃不傳音者故室外泰晤士河畔雖終日電車隆隆而室内則絕不蒙其影響此室之地板承塵以及四壁皆用金屬鑲製一切消息均來自倫敦至高之天空</p>
<p>此金屬建成之司機室外尙有數室則塲中之無線電機械工程師終日處其中以從事於設計製造修理等事彼輩今方計費製造小型輕便可以携帶往來之無線電話收音機裝置於機車警察之車上去</p>
<h3>記靑島砲臺</h3>
<p>— 金俊仁</p>
<p>靑島爲國避暑名區之一砲台則爲靑島名勝之一凡游靑島者必一游砲台殆可斷言也</p>
<p>靑島砲台爲德人所創爲數凡四日德戰後迄至今日已同荆棘銅駝但供憑弔而已聞德軍於戰敗退出時多自加摧毀其意蓋免貽利於敵也予於六月間往游一號砲台有指導二人啓關導入内中陰寒黯黑令人不耐導者於門次燃白蠟二枝照耀前行行經一室必爲游者言一室之作用地濕氣寒在在若伏鬼物而一點獨光若明若滅尤足令人生怖有一室據導者言爲日德戰時紅十字會所居白堊之牆上著生人之血無數血跡斑斑渾流自普魯士軍人之身也又一室中置木桶二高與人齊其一已空一則尙有深碧色之流質物導者言此乃普魯士軍人之廚室桶中之流質物則當年戰時所食之牛油也</p>
<p>一號砲台裝置大砲凡四予於其最小之砲位下一門入於其最大之砲位下一門出旣出之後得見天日樹陰匝地海波不興幽蒨之景固足使人留戀也</p>

<h3>鄕下人又到上海（四）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>那個穿灰色衣服的人剛走到了鄕下人的傍邊却見一個人走上前來和他打照呼那個人面孔雪白嘴唇緋紅只是在鼻子底下有一撮小鬍子約摸有一寸不到八分有餘光景他想··這一定是剃頭司務不當心誤剃了他左邊鬍子因此也所他的右邊鬍子修短了變成這個模樣兒他又想··到底城裹人保養得好要是我們鄕下人養了鬍子的人都是面黄肌廋他要是没有這一撮鬍子我還當他是二十餘歲的小夥子咧</p>
<p>鄕下人見那養了鬍子的小白臉身上穿了一件白夏布長衫外面還穿了一件黑紗馬褂他心裹又是納罕城裹人眞不怕熱夏布長衫上還罩着馬褂像我們只穿一件單短衫還出了一身臭汗咧</p>
<p>「您也是迎接王委員的嗎」鄕下人聽出是一個彎舌頭（註四）</p>
<p>「是的他們有電報說是這一趟車來的」那是有鬍子的小白臉答覆灰色衣服人的话</p>
<p>鄕下人聽了暗自納悶想一個委員也値得許多人去迎接他嗎我聽得我們一個圖董講起··委員是一種頂小的官比了縣大老爺還要小得多從前的查夜官城門官解餉官都是委員當的到了收租的時候我們鄕下人還不起租米拉到城裹去打屁股的那種就呌做催租委員聽說那種委員還是向上司那裹磕頭求拜的求來的他們拉到了佃户問也不一問專門打屁股那些倔强的老吃租米人有時還要挺撞他戲弄他打屁股的時候大喊道··「大老爺打殺哉」「大老爺打殺哉」</p>
<p>「但我是不欠租米也不怕什麽委員」鄕下人很覺得問心無愧但他倒是守着孔夫子疑思問的宗旨却想問問他們所迎接的是什麽委員値得這樣的愼重其事</p>
<p>「請問先生··你們迎接的是什麽委員」鄕下人實在熬不住向那位養鬍子的小白臉發問了</p>
<p>那個小白臉瞅了他一眼鼻子裹哼了一聲便道··</p>
<p>「什麽委員還不是中央委員嗎」</p>
<p>「哈哈種秧委員現在七月裹的天氣了還派種秧委員城裹人只知道吃飯完全不知道種田的經絡咧」</p>
<p>（註四）鄕下人稱打官話者爲彎舌頭</p>
<h3>談談綠氣砲及其防避法（下）</h3>
<p>— 吳羽伯</p>
<p>防禦之法聽說現在德人發明一穩中和瓦斯一經放射至空氣裹可使　力消減但這句話祇聽見有此一說還不知道究竟是什麽藥劑做成以及是眞假俱不可知因爲德人尙守秘密也不過歐美所尋常應用而視爲確實可靠的是一種面具用橡膠皮製成通一呼吸管此營接在一種貯有吸收毒氣藥料的吸毒箱上（所謂藥料是說用松柏或椰子樹燒成炭未但須經過繁重化學手續方可製成依現時我國的化學設備不要說毒氣做不出即此吸收毒氣的活性炭素也做不出因這種炭未要非常純凈所有燒燃時發生之烟脂非用化學方汉除去不可）因毒氣有種種不同故防禦方法不能一律防綠氣等炭素未是有效的但光氣非將曹達石灰濕於吸毒箱内不可又如砒劑毒瓦斯此種普通的吸毒箱還是不行非用特别製成的濾紙數十層不可（濾紙是用樹心之莖髓做的）至於毒氣大王那毒力劇烈極了除了要戴面具以保護叩目及呼吸器之外並須渾身着用一種油布製成的防毒衣連頭到脚要包裹得不露一點空隙咳這未說起來假使敵人用芥子瓦斯十噸就可以守全消滅一個大都市因爲面具哪·防毒衣哪·倉卒之中何從辦起即便有準備的時間而因原料之缺乏和化學設備之幼稚仍然是辦不到的祇有一句話呌做束手待斃咳然而悲觀是無益的論以無法之中未嘗没有法子防芥子瓦斯雖不足防别種毒氣是有效的其法如何茲就其簡單易行者爲述於左</p>
<p>（一）要鎭靜·不可亂跑·及運動身體各部</p>

<p>一週來紗市毫無榮辱絕無精彩形勢暗濬蓋以國事仍在風雨飄搖中而銀根奇繁因之名帮實銷益覺岑寂無興奮趣味故人心平疲殊乏振作氣象但現紗價格甚爲堅俏因抗日運動劇烈日紗不能通行專　華紗不敷供給所以交易雖减市價尙能維持至於標紗市情日見荒凉　以多至兩方鑒於大勢狀况難以舉動於是生意人爲减少市面由此停滯照實際上測之暫時仍無極入變化深恐有一度盤旋也標紗各月份與前週相仿云</p>
<h3>上週棉市初堅後軟</h3>
<p>現銷被外棉侵奪冶盡</p>
<p>棉市在週初形勢十分挺拔買方觀高心思達於極點因美棉市價穩靜且有上漲可能而國内年景荒歉各路來源不多故漢帮及一部份多頭本月份頗有軋空心思濃密拉力愈强但外棉雖漲然銀市放長採算銀盤依然廉宜故各廠大量收進外棉對於本棉絕無　意因價格較外棉爲高　故也本週中各廠購買印美棉约有三四萬件之巨華棉之銷量完全被其侵奪矣所以投機大户在　月標棉依然抛空前途仍屬軟化交易所標棉各月價與上週相仿美棉比上週跌二十五磅音云</p>

<h3>一個熱血靑年的呼聲</h3>
<p>— 綺</p>
<p>如芳　　昨夜我回寓的時候凄淸的月色瀉滿丁我的屋子朦朧的月光中望到桌上有你给我的信我紐開電燈像餓鷹似的興奮的讀可是你這滿充着熱血的一字一淚我不是鐵石鑄成的心肝五臟·這對於我是多麽可怕的刺激當時我感到一陳顫慄哭吧笑吧不知怎樣纔好</p>
<p>從秋風自東北吹來一陣血腥殺人放火的日本帝國主義暴露了　猙獰的面目後我們的民族便被矮寇渺視爲懦弱的民族有的在緊張空氣中惶恐驚駭着呐喊着志士靑年的熱血在滚滚地交流可憐竟也有偷生夢死的仍舊在沉醉酒肉的迷夢中這散沙般的民族劣根性我們除了仰天長嘆外還說什麽呢祇是我們何不幸生於這時代</p>
<p>你告訴我關於Ｘ君的消息一個有親日嫌疑的消息這眞是使我吃了一驚我不知怎樣憤恨這欺人的朋友侮辱了我們民族</p>
<p>關於這事的底藴你曾用一度探訪這事在你心目中已有很深的印像八九分可捉摸只是還不知道這事出於他自已主動還是由他家庭的被動一時尙不能找到確實的證據但是有一次你曾發現這日本人在他家裏秘密的談話你曾用磚頭去擊那日本人走上汽車這一切明於事理的目覩不是證實了他冷了血的行動</p>
<p>還有我記起一件有嫌疑的事有一次黄昏我遇到他談到東北被難問題他問我個人意見應如何抗日我說誓不買日貨决與日本斷絕邦交除了盡我力量宣傳當兵却限於體弱實際能否肩起刀槍到沙塲去肉搏仇人還不能自信反之我問他你如何呢他說他的環境不能使他留戀能捨身從戎是很好的機會他一准去當軍人要是中日有戰爭的時候他又說他平素同日本人感情很好日本朋友很多他愛用日本貨物因爲價錢便宜貨色又好但是現在爲了祖國爲了民族就非抵制他不可當時我却被他這「非抵制不可」朦混了過去可是我那裹猜出他完全是口是心非呢我更没有知道他有親日的行爲呀</p>
<p>眞的無論如何想不到受過高深敎育的他僅不過認識幾個日本人而對日本帝國主義者竟有如斯好感和日本人合作事務代爲出名收買國土如斯賣國賣民之國賊是可忍孰不可忍如芳先前我倆都被他朦蔽了承認他是我們朋友如今呢不共戴天的仇人了豈僅是我倆的蕳直是中華民國的公敵啊</p>
<p>你說Ｘ君同我感情不壤在没有目覩一切以前你不想把這痛心消息告訴我現在你熱血將從一顆赤心裹迸裂出來你的良心不許你的朋友陷於這敗類的陷阱的於是你把這人的陰謀向我宣佈了我不知怎樣感激你纔好我像一隻黑夜航海的小舟你却做了指路燈塔了　　如芳你知道也許你對我幾年來交誼中應有的認識我决不是冷血無靈性的甘心和這賣國賊亡國奴爲伍現在又是什麽時候生死的關頭我們有的是熱血勇氣我們應爲民族去奮鬭我們拿不動槍至少還可以把這槍桿縮短縮成五六寸長的筆桿來做文字上的呐喊</p>

<h3>中國五年軍事航空計劃　叔淵</h3>

<p>飛機發明雖僅有二十餘年之歷史然其進步之速殊足令人驚駭自歐戰以後各國軍事家之聚精會神必思得當而出人頭地者莫不在空戰二字蓋戰爭演進由平面而立體研究國防者不僅防守地盤對空中氣盤尤應特别防禦因氣盤不保其地盤决難維持也即此次暴日佔我東省即以空軍爲其先鋒爆擊轟炸極盡能事反觀我國空軍對内作戰雖有長足之進步然防空計劃尙未完成何足以禦外侮據美國軍事專家發表云以六十架飛機載六十噸毒瓦斯量散布於東京市面則可置東京於絕地吾人試觀北平天津及廣州市之面積寬度建築物之結構與氣候温度等計算之若以五十架飛機載五十噸炸彈量之毒瓦斯於四小時内可置平津廣州市人畜於絕地又不觀過去英海軍甲全球而無防空軍不能禁德飛機之轟倫敦法陸軍冠各國因無防空設備不能阻德軍飛機之攻擊巴黎况我國陸防空事業瞠乎其後於航空軍事之建設誠有刻不容緩矣航空尃家黄秉衡君有鑒於此盱衡國際軍事情勢參酌國家經濟力量著爲中國五年軍事航空計劃一書在此暴日侵略有加未已之中不僅軍事當局應奉爲圭臬即我國民在日呼與日宣戰亦應明瞭我空軍之如何落後宣如何建設而有一讀此書之必要</p>
<p>著者於空軍在國防上有如何重要以外基於國内環境上更舉出編著此書之理三端（一）興創事業之要素不外人才與物質二者人才一訓練之問題耳惟物質問題在中國目前誠不易解决在西方物質文明已有基礎新興事業不過因而擴展加工措施自易在中國則異是故難航空事業尤甚例如工業向無基礎則航空製造之機器及熟料無從取給交通尚未發達則修理補給不易施爲電氣未能普遍則夜間航行莫由興辦油礦仍未開採則燃料全特舶來諸如此類不可勝數在此種環境之下如彼此束手悲觀則直無計劃發展之可言然要知工商經濟本有相因相成之勢一不興則百不舉航空爲最新奇之事業最精進之武器又與國家工商經濟關係如此其鉅處此弱肉强食之秋爲民族之生存計正宜從狹道中突擊而出冀或收迎頭趕上之功此就建設上言航空之不可不有所計劃一也（二）現有航空不過不整齊之飛機數十架技術中平之人員百餘名開而未闢之機塲十餘所並無有何基礎之可言然正唯其如是故亦易於着手發展猶之無瑕之璧未成之年可以最材施敎隨意琢磨成器非若其他舊有事業承戰亂之餘業已多所糾紛苴漏救濟整理之不暇更何從計及發展此就時機上言航空之不可不有所計劃二也（三）政府用於陸軍之給養月二千餘萬航空自署以下以至各隊廠站包括消耗修理纔十五萬元是所費尙不及陸軍百分之一也諸軍事先進者多已有見及此發爲裁減陸軍充實空軍之議據美國戰術家言以一架設備完善之飛機用四個技藝高强之航員策應工作即可敵陸地一師之兵力故美國全國陸軍不過十二萬空軍則議增至二萬餘人是亦權宜輕重熟知緩急而已陸軍縱不能即裁亦豈可因噎廢食株守害時此就經濟上言航空之不可不有所計劃三也</p>
<p>著者於叙述編著是書理由以後其第二編即爲計劃提要第三編爲提要之說明第四編爲五年計劃之總槪算第五編爲分年設施步驟提要及其槪算</p>
<p>計劃提要分爲八點（一）於五年之内以適宜之組織創設空軍以五百架分種精銳之飛機爲其基本之設備（二）於同期間内在國内國外訓練足以應付此五百架有組織的飛機工作之空軍軍官一千人另軍佐軍士三千人並足以協助掩護此五百架飛機之員兵三千人（三）計劃全國爲十二空軍區於同期内就各區擇衝要地點建設十二個空軍根據地（四）於同期間内配置足以保養此五百飛機之供應局十二所及棚廠若干座（五）於同期間内完成足以使此五百飛機在各空軍區間往來飛行無阻之航空路計劃空站五十七所備用飛行塲若干所航空標誌若干處（六）於同時間内設立足以指揮此五百飛機一切活動及保障其空中安全之航空無綫電台七十餘所航空測候所五十餘所（七）於同期間内設備足以抵禦低空襲擊之防空武力（八）於同期間内興創十二空軍根據地夜間飛行之設備並設置可能範圍内之夜間航路</p>
<p>上項計劃之提要在第三編中均有詳細之說明并精蜜之圖表與紙上談兵毫無計劃者逈不相同著者曰「前年德顧問福克斯對於我國軍事航空建設之計劃亦多所擬議惟其對於我國國情頗多隔膜故不免有近於空言誇大及不顧事實與可能之處……須知建設事業之計劃决不可就片面想像徒托空言不顧及國家之財力與事實之可能而强人之所難也……」從而可知著者之就實際計劃不尙空談矣</p>
<p>在第四編五年計劃之總槪算分（甲）關於空軍敎育者（一）在國内養成飛行軍官九百人（二）國外養成飛行及工程軍官一百人（三）養成空中工作軍士一千人（四）養成機械槍砲電信測候等技術軍士二千人（五）養成航空兵三千人（六）外籍技術敎官第一年三十人以後遞减（七）國籍技術敎官第一年五十人以後遞加（八）其他職敎員薪給（九）校舍及其機場修理廠庫棚廠之建築及設備（十）校所營廠庫之辦公費及雜支服役總共關於空軍敎育之槪算計國幣二千九百一十三萬元（乙）關於空軍建設者（一）飛機五百架（二）飛機零件（三）供應局十二所（四）飛機棚廠設於根據地及各航站者（五）首都航空站（大）其他根據地及航空站（七）各根據地之營房（八）夜間飛行及航行之設備（九）防空砲隊兵器共五十一組計十七隊（十）各根據地之地面交通及各大隊空中救護工具等總共關於空軍建設之槪算計國幣一萬一千五百六十三萬元</p>

<p>上項計劃雖需鉅欵然分期實行亦易完成際此外侮日亟而又以飛將軍爲急先鋒我國若再不從事於空軍之建設則并此碩果僅存之領空亦將爲强暴者攫奪以去故在介紹此書於讀者之前深願著者之計劃於五年之後而一一實現焉</p>

<h3>Japanese Armored Train Arrives at Tongliao North Station</h3>
<p>Bombarding the City with Artillery Fire</p>
<p>Covering the Advance of Mongolian Bandits</p>
<p>Peiping: Four Japanese armored trains arrived at Tongliao North Station this afternoon and fired several artillery shells at Tongliao County. Several thousand Mongolian bandits were behind the Japanese troops, preparing to attack Tongliao. Our side has dismantled a section of the railway tracks outside the north and south stations of Tongliao to prevent the Japanese army from advancing. The armored train of our Third Brigade is still at the south station. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Tientsin: Under the command of Japanese, bandits looted Tongliao but were repelled by the Third Cavalry Brigade. At 2:00 PM on the 31st, over a thousand bandits gathered to launch a large-scale counterattack. A Japanese plane scouted ahead to guide the bandits. The bandits advanced to Wudao Wei, fifteen li from Tongliao, but were repelled by the local militia. One Japanese armored train arrived at the north station at noon on the 1st. More than a thousand bandits were concealed several miles behind the armored train. The stationmaster of Daotong Road urgently ordered the tracks to be cut to prevent the armored train from leading the bandits into the south station. When the Japanese soldiers saw this, they were furious and fired more than ten artillery shells into the city, causing many casualties. As of 6:00 PM on the 1st, neither the armored train nor the bandits had retreated. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: Over a thousand Japanese soldiers left Gongzhuling for Tongliao on the 28th, claiming to be suppressing bandits. (29th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Actively Engaging in Restoration Activities</h3>
<p>Pu Wei Takes Office as Chairman</p>
<p>Declares Manchus Will Govern Manchuria</p>
<p>Peiping: On the morning of the 31st, Pu Wei held a public rally at Beiling. Pu took office as the chairman of the Siwei Society on the spot, declaring that Manchus would govern Manchuria and that he was determined to cooperate with the Japanese to the end. Pu personally carried rice and wheat to buy people's hearts. He also asked the Japanese commander to notify the city of Shenyang to celebrate by hanging Japanese flags throughout the city. Japanese soldiers arrested many Chinese people during the public rally, and their whereabouts are unknown. Pu lives in the former residence of Zhang Zuolin's fifth concubine, and restoration activities are being actively planned. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: Pu Wei has established the Manchu-Mongol Independence Research Association in Shenyang to plan an independence program. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Pu Wei, Dreaming of Becoming Emperor, Makes Sacrifices at Zhaoling</h3>
<p>Japanese Generals and Councilors Present Wreaths</p>
<p>Japanese Army Dispatches Large Detachment to Guard the Route</p>
<p>Harbin: Pu Wei made sacrifices at Zhaoling on the 26th. The Japanese army dispatched a large detachment from outside the north gate to the mausoleum and forcibly drove thousands of villagers to watch. Pu, wearing a blue robe and black mandarin jacket, along with over forty restorationists, performed three bows and nine prostrations in front of the mausoleum and wept loudly. He addressed the villagers, saying that his visit had two purposes: to pay respects to the mausoleum and because he, as a Fengtian person, could not bear to see the people suffering in deep water and hot fire. He said that he would provide everyone with food in Fengtian, and then gave each person a bread roll. Finally, he led the villagers in shouting "Long live Sino-Japanese friendship" three times. His memorial to his ancestors stated that the distant descendant Pu Wei had been in Lianbin for a long time and had not been able to pay respects to the ancestral temple. His heart was filled with longing and grief. He was grateful for the spirit of his ancestors and the justice of good neighbors. The treacherous party that had occupied the area for twenty years had suddenly withered away, and the bandit Zhang, who had stolen four provinces, had collapsed. On the day when the sun reappeared and its brilliance was restored, the gentry and commoners of the four surrounding areas of Shenyang elected the subject Wei to serve as the chairman of the Si Min Maintenance Association. The subject Wei was moved to tears and felt ashamed and inadequate. He respectfully paid homage to the spirit tablets in the temple, praying for the spirits of the ancestors in heaven to grant the people of the four provinces enduring peace and happiness. Pu's behavior was rebellious and absurd to this extent. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: After secretly entering Shenyang, Pu Wei rented a residence on Bowei Road in the commercial district. After succeeding Kan Chao-hsi as the chairman of the Si Min Maintenance Association, he was overjoyed and held a sacrificial ceremony at the mausoleum on the 26th. On the morning of the 26th, Pu Wei and his entourage traveled in dozens of horse-drawn carriages and over ten automobiles directly to Beiling. Before their departure, hundreds of lamas, Muslims, Buddhists, and Taoists played musical instruments, as if welcoming deities. There were also whole pigs and sheep offered as sacrifices. Japanese generals Fukuda and Inoue, as well as members of both houses of the Japanese Diet, all presented wreaths. Pu Wei performed three kneelings and nine prostrations in front of the mausoleum. This was the first sacrificial ceremony at the desolate tomb of Beiling in the years since the revolution. Observers were all indignant. It is reported that Pu Yi, who is living in Tianjin, recently sent a secret letter to Pu Wei, stating that he could not make the trip due to his circumstances but hoped that he would strive to build an independent country and inherit the legacy of their ancestors. This shows that the talk of restoration is not just empty words. (One-day special dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Questioning the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State</h3>
<p>From the perspective of Sino-American history, the United States must have a fair position on Japan's atrocities in our Northeast and express it to the world. Furthermore, considering that American industrialists and economists have been paying attention to the Far East and have been continuously traveling to [China] for inspections, the United States must also have something to say about Japan's actions in our Northeast due to its interests. At the beginning of the League of Nations meeting, the US government sent a letter to the League of Nations urging representatives to work hard to resolve the Sino-Japanese problem and stated that if the United States' assistance was needed, it could send representatives to attend. At that time, the United States seemed to be far from indifferent to the Sino-Japanese issue and was not absolutely unwilling to participate. However, after the League of Nations unanimously requested the United States to participate, the United States, apart from agreeing to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact, made no other statement and repeatedly declared that it would strictly maintain neutrality and was unwilling to interfere, avoiding it as if afraid of being too slow. Its attitude suddenly became ambiguous. If it were truly not suspicious of the League of Nations, then it would be sympathetic to Japan. But according to today's statement by US Deputy Secretary of State Castle, it is still impossible not to doubt him. He said, "Under the treaty guaranteeing China's integrity, the United States feels compelled to oppose Japan's prolonged occupation of Manchuria." What is the limit of what Castle calls "prolonged"? Japan occupies our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, still thinking it is not enough, and is using restorationists and bandits, and assisting our frustrated military men, to rapidly advance to northern Manchuria. Its destruction of our territorial integrity cannot be said to be insignificant. Since September 18, it has occupied Liaoning and Jilin for nearly two months. The time cannot be said to be short. Does Castle mean that this is a "prolonged occupation" or does he still think it is temporary and will only be considered a "prolonged occupation" after several years? This cannot but be questioned of Castle. He also said, "The United States did not endorse the League of Nations' request that Japan withdraw its troops before November 16 because the League of Nations had not asked the United States to express its opinion." And, "The United States is not a member of the League of Nations, so it should not comment publicly before being asked to speak." However, when the League of Nations previously asked the United States to participate in resolving the Manchurian problem, the United States had already stated that as a non-member state, it would only be allowed to observe and not to speak, except when it involved the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Now, interpreting Castle's words, it seems that it did not speak because the League of Nations did not ask it to speak. If the League of Nations asks the United States to speak urgently in the future, will the United States be able to agree? And if China asks the United States to speak according to the Nine-Power Treaty, will the United States be able to allow it to speak? This cannot but be questioned of Castle. The attitude of the United States towards this issue has been ambiguous for a long time, and the world has been hoping for its clear attitude for a long time. Preserving the territorial integrity of China is stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty. Now Castle has clearly admitted that the Japanese occupation of Manchuria is a destruction of Chinese territory and must be opposed by the treaty. Moreover, the Japanese occupation of Manchuria still shows no intention of withdrawing its troops, and no one can consider it a temporary action. Therefore, according to Castle's words, the United States should urgently clarify its attitude. Furthermore, although the League of Nations has not explicitly asked the United States to speak, it has actually been hoping for the United States to speak with a fair attitude for a long time, and our national public opinion is also very much hoping that the United States, as the leader of the Nine-Power Treaty, will make a statement. Although it does not have the form of an invitation to speak, it has the spirit of a unanimous invitation. Therefore, according to Castle's words, the United States has even more reason to clarify its attitude. The time is now! If this opportunity is lost again, the reputation of the United States in the world for fairness and its praise for speaking out for justice will be lost forever.</p>

<h3>Soviet Government Denies Increasing Troops on the Border</h3>
<p>But Is Quite Concerned About White Russian Activities</p>
<p>Moscow: The Russian government today strongly denied reports that Soviet troops were concentrating on the Manchurian border, saying that Russian authorities did not consider that the Manchurian dispute had entered a period when Russian troops had to concentrate on the Far Eastern border. However, since the Sino-Soviet conflict over the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929, Russia has always deployed heavy troops on the Far Eastern border. Recently, Russian newspapers have continued to attack Japanese imperialism and the weakness and uselessness of the League of Nations. Some days ago, Morotov, a key figure in the Russian government, gave a speech to over 10,000 workers at the Moscow Electrical Chemical Plant, saying that the situation in Manchuria would not immediately cause a dangerous war, but that "we are closely watching. Our policy is not to interfere in Sino-Japanese affairs, but we will not allow it to infringe on our interests." Most people believe that Morotov's words are sufficient to represent the Soviet authorities' attitude towards the Manchurian case. Morotov also said that the only thing that Moscow is worried about today is that the White Russian soldiers in Manchuria may attempt to drag the Soviet Union into the vortex.

<h3>Japanese Warships Continue to Arrive in Hankou</h3>

<h3>British Press Comments on China's Proposal for Arbitration</h3>
<p>"Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant</p>
<p>Should Not Be Viewed as the Only Important Point"</p>
<p>London: Sunday newspapers mostly commented on the Chinese incident, the situation in Jeju, and the disappearance of Tao Peng, all of which attracted attention. The Observer discussed the basic principles put forward by Japan for consideration regarding the Manchurian affair, saying that China's letter to the League of Nations proposing that the points of contention in the Sino-Japanese treaty be submitted to arbitration and declaring that China respects all treaty obligations has expressed its intention to resolve the difficulties created by Japan's fifth basic principle, the so-called respect for Japan's treaty rights in Manchuria. Logically speaking, these two points are compatible. Now, clarifying that these two points are not contradictory is a clear opportunity for Geneva. Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant must not be invoked as the League's main point because invoking Article 15 entails disaster. In its attempt to prevent war, the League of Nations may easily provoke a war that is formally not [war] but is actually [war]. However, permanent staff in Geneva seem to know that the path of arbitration that has now been opened is a good thing. If the Japanese army voluntarily withdraws by November 16, the main crisis of peace can be averted. Tokyo must understand that Nanjing is now declaring to Geneva the spirit of accepting any method of neutral monitoring of the withdrawal of troops. If Tokyo takes advantage of the opportunity now offered to combine correction and security, it will greatly benefit Japan and its undoubtedly treaty rights. The Observer also said that news from Tokyo that the British ambassador, Lampson, had reached an agreement with the Nanjing government on the abolition of extraterritoriality had created an impression that the agreement had been reached, but there was no basis for this claim. Sino-British negotiations on the abolition of extraterritoriality have been going on for a long time without any new developments. The negotiations have not yet been effective. The Sunday Times stated that the Chinese government's note on the Tao Peng case has been under consideration by the British Foreign Minister for a week. It is said that the explanations of the Chinese authorities have been accepted and that the proposals in the note can provide a satisfactory basis for resolving the case.

<h3>Additional Levies on Customs Duties for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Referred to the Legislative Yuan for Review</p>
<p>Nanjing: Because the National Government found it difficult to raise the full amount of disaster relief bonds within the scheduled period, it proposed to the Central Political Council to add 10% to the current tax rate on customs duties, starting from December 1st and continuing until the end of July next year. This is estimated to generate over 13 million yuan, which will be used entirely for disaster relief. Starting from August next year, another 5% will be levied specifically to repay the US wheat loan until the debt is cleared. The Central Political Council has approved this plan in principle and referred it to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan immediately referred it to the Finance and Economics Group for review and submitted it to the General Assembly for discussion. (One-day special telegram)</p>

<h3>Disarmament Stance</h3>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 31st: Today, the Secretariat of the League of Nations announced that the plan to suspend various constructions on armaments for one year could not be implemented immediately because several countries had raised reservations that required further consideration. It is hoped that the disarmament conference next spring will be able to realize it. Today, news from Paris stated that the French Foreign Ministry had notified the League of Nations that France was willing to accept it only if neighboring countries also accepted it. News from Berlin stated that the German government had notified the League of Nations that it was willing to accept it, and the Berlin Daily reported that the Czech government had also notified the League of Nations of its acceptance. In addition, Britain, Japan, Russia, and the United States have also made similar notifications.

<h3>X-Ray Expert Studies Scientific Spirit</h3>
<p>Paralyzed Arm, Ultimately Sacrificed His Life</p>
<p>Will Specified that His Body Be Used for Testing</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Vienna, 31st: World-renowned X-ray expert Professor Guido Holzknecht died in Vienna today at the age of 58, sacrificing his life for science. Professor Holzknecht became known as an X-ray expert early in his career. During the European War, the Roentgen Institute established by the Austrian Red Cross was mostly managed by Professor Holzknecht alone. It was at this time that Professor Holzknecht contracted a strange disease, the X-ray disease that scientists fear. The cause of this disease has not yet been determined, either due to excessive exposure to X-rays or due to a lack of precautions. After contracting this disease, Professor Holzknecht continued his exploration of X-rays without the slightest slackening, and the disease gradually worsened. First, one finger on his right hand was removed, then another. In the past few years, his right hand and forearm had been successively amputated, but the disease did not diminish at all. Last year, most of the skin on the upper part of Professor Holzknecht's body had to be peeled off piece by piece. Professor Holzknecht suffered immense pain, and his physical strength weakened day by day, but his spirit of advancement did not diminish at all. On Wednesday of last week, he already knew that he would not recover, but even a few days before his death, he still had people carry him into the laboratory on a cloth bed, but he could only dictate methods and ask others to test them. Professor Holzknecht once told people that he wanted to complete a certain important experiment before his death. After Professor Holzknecht's death, a will was found in his documents instructing that his remains be used for certain tests. His last wishes have been carried out, and his body has been sent to the Vienna University Anatomy Institute. This afternoon, the Vienna Medical Society held a memorial service for Professor Holzknecht. Medical organizations around the world have sent telegrams to his family to express their condolences. The Roentgen Societies in London and New York have both sent telegrams expressing their condolences, as Professor Holzknecht was an honorary member of both societies during his lifetime.</p>

As a result, it was decided to hold a general meeting of party members around the 10th of this month to discuss economic and diplomatic issues, and to issue a declaration on the following matters: (1) The government's hasty lifting of the gold embargo without preparation has resulted in the economic world suffering unprecedented major impacts and falling into a difficult situation. The only solution is to prohibit gold exports again. (2) Foreign Minister Shidehara is subservient to the military and pretends to be strong. We reject such follow-the-leader diplomacy and establish autonomous diplomacy. (3) Since the formation of the Minseito cabinet, political chaos has reached its peak and should be quickly restored to political control.</p>
<h3>US Senator Johnson Attacks Government for Joining League of Nations</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Washington, 31st: US Senator Johnson, a prominent member of the Republican Party in the Senate, known for his opposition to the United States joining the League of Nations, issued a statement here today claiming that the US executive branch has deceived voters and forced the United States into the League of Nations. The only way for the people to save themselves is through elections. Therefore, during the presidential election next year, the old policy of maintaining friendly relations with other countries without political ties should be reaffirmed during the vote. Senator Johnson's remarks have aroused much speculation as to whether he intends to rejoin the presidential election. It is expected that when the new Congress convenes in December, the opposition will attack the US government's appointment of formal representatives to attend meetings of the League of Nations Council as observers.

<h3>The Position of the Pound is Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 31st: The Federal Reserve Bank's report for this week indicates that Europe no longer has any concerns about the stability of the US dollar. These concerns have always been viewed as frivolous and will not last long. According to the Federal Reserve Bank's report for this week, gold outflows have averaged about $75 million per week since Britain suspended the gold standard, but inflows have also been large, with a net gain of $27 million. The amount earmarked for foreign withdrawals is now $500 million, which has already been deducted from the US gold reserves and will therefore no longer affect the market.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Note to League of Nations</p>
<p>Urgently Urging Japan to Abide by League of Nations Resolutions</p>
<p>And Requesting the League of Nations to Fairly Resolve the Dispute</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a Chinese note to the League of Nations at 3:00 PM on the 1st. This document has been telegraphed to Representative Shi Zhaoji by the Ministry for him to deliver to the League of Nations Secretariat. The full text of the note is as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese government received a copy of the Japanese government's note of the 26th, forwarded by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on October 28th. The Chinese government hereby responds as follows: The Japanese government, in its note to the member states of the Executive Yuan, reiterated that its sole reason for refusing to withdraw its troops from Chinese territory is that, in its view, the lives and property of Japanese residents in various regions would be endangered upon withdrawal. Regarding this point, the following opinions are specifically stated:</p>
<p>(1) The statement by the Chinese representative to the Executive Yuan on October 23rd expressed the Chinese government's view that the danger currently alleged by the Japanese authorities is actually caused by the presence of Japanese troops on Chinese territory. This statement was further supplemented by the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Briand, who stated at the meeting of the Executive Yuan on October 24th, "If military occupation is used as a means of peace, I fear that it will not be tolerated by world opinion. I believe that military occupation should be excluded from such measures, as prolonging such occupation will inevitably prolong the state of unrest that has already lasted for a long time." At the time of the Washington Conference, US Secretary of State Hughes strongly argued that military occupation would inevitably lead to a state of disorder. As a pretext for continued occupation, the Japanese side's declaration at the Washington Conference stated that if the Japanese government withdrew its troops from eastern Siberia, it would inevitably endanger the lives and property of the Japanese people. Hughes commented on this declaration, "The US government believes that continuing to occupy key fortresses in eastern Siberia and establishing local administrations will inevitably cause misunderstandings and resentment. The state of unrest and disorder in that region will not only fail to subside but will also intensify. If the US government does not express this opinion, it will be unfaithful to the spirit of cooperation in dispatching troops to Siberia agreed upon with the Japanese government in the summer of 1918." Regarding the situation in eastern Siberia, Hughes further stated in the same official letter of reply to the Japanese government, "The Japanese government believes that it is necessary to occupy Russian territory as a means of ensuring a satisfactory resolution with the future Russian government. The US deeply regrets this."</p>
<p>(2) The resolution proposed by the member states of the Executive Yuan (excluding the countries involved) on January 22nd and accepted by China acknowledges that the Chinese government is responsible for protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents in the receiving areas and requests the Chinese government to have Chinese officials responsible for the reception, together with representatives of neutral countries, handle the matter. The Chinese representative also stated to the Executive Yuan, "The Chinese government is very willing to consider any proposal in an extremely friendly spirit to expand the organization of neutral country officials or to arrange other local measures with the assistance of the League of Nations to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in the receiving areas, in order to dispel all the concerns of the Japanese government that complying with the Executive Yuan's resolution might endanger the Japanese people." The Japanese note of October 26th states that only a small number of troops remain in a few locations outside the railway area. If this is indeed the case, the Chinese government firmly believes that with the assistance of the League of Nations, a solution can be quickly chosen, as suggested by the Chinese representative, to enable this small number of Japanese troops to withdraw safely and quickly.</p>
<p>(3) The Chinese government is pleased to learn that the Japanese government firmly denies that its government intends to use military pressure to negotiate with China. However, the Chinese government believes that it should be pointed out that if the Japanese government's view is indeed the case, then the only way to make it effective is to no longer require prior negotiation with China on the basic outline of the future relationship between the two countries as a prerequisite for troop withdrawal. The Executive Yuan's resolution and the Chinese government's promise to the Executive Yuan have provided the broadest guarantee for the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in all areas where Japanese troops withdraw. To ensure the effectiveness of this guarantee and promise, the only way is to establish a local partial solution as the Japanese troops withdraw, just as Mr. Briand said in the Executive Yuan, which would take no more than a few days at most. Therefore, this is completely different from diplomatic consultations between the Chinese and Japanese governments and is completely unrelated.</p>
<p>(4) The Chinese government also wishes to permanently end the tense situation between the two countries, just as the Japanese government desires, and is sincerely willing to rebuild and improve the foundation of its relationship to ensure lasting peace and amity. The Chinese government believes that the first step to achieve this goal is to comply with the Executive Yuan's resolution. However, as long as the Japanese troops illegally occupy Chinese territory in violation of the Executive Yuan's request, Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, Article 2 of the Pact of Paris, and Article 1 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, it will be difficult to seek good relations between the two countries or engage in consultations with each other. Only when this situation ends can the two countries, as faithful members of the League of Nations, agree to begin striving to eliminate their negative impressions of each other. The Chinese government believes that the only way to benefit from the lessons learned in recent weeks, to achieve the effectiveness of the League of Nations' handling, and to prevent the recurrence of disputes endangering peace in the Far East is to establish a permanent mediation mechanism as proposed by the Chinese government to seek a peaceful and just resolution of any disputes between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Chinese government must reiterate that the current prerequisite is that the Japanese troops should immediately begin withdrawing in accordance with the Executive Yuan's resolution and complete their withdrawal before November 16th.</p>
<h3>Three Verbal Battles Between Chinese and Japanese Representatives at the League of Nations</h3>
<p>China's Sincere Efforts to Safeguard Peace Are Now Clearly Understood by the World</p>
<p>A Diplomatic Strategy with Clear Steps Over the Past Decade Since the End of World War I</p>
<p>World News Agency, Geneva Correspondence, September 25th - Representative Shi's declaration at the Executive Yuan meeting stated that the resolution of the Executive Yuan on September 22nd is, from China's perspective, a preliminary measure. It is now necessary to demand a complete withdrawal of troops based on Article 11 of the Covenant and to quickly form an impartial fact-finding committee to send personnel to the invaded areas to investigate whether the original state has been restored and report accordingly to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan will also declare to the Japanese government that if Japan does not immediately withdraw its troops, it will be a member state that does not comply with the Covenant and fulfill its due responsibilities. If Japan does not abide by the agreement, it will not only be subject to the intervention of the Executive Yuan but will also provoke the joint intervention of all countries in the world. Moreover, the representative further stated that the peace and tranquility of the Chinese people can be assured to not harm Japanese residents. According to the Japanese representative's report, the Japanese troops are still lingering in places where they should not be stationed. If China cannot be trusted by Japan, just as the Chinese cannot trust the Japanese, then the impartial fact-finding committee should be organized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 28th, the news of the Chinese youth demonstration and the destruction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reached Switzerland. The Chairman of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, Lele, was greatly shocked and blamed the Western newspaper reporters for their careless telegrams, which caused distant people to misunderstand and caused unwarranted disasters for Foreign Minister Wang. That evening, the Executive Yuan rushed to convene a meeting, and the chairman solemnly reported the injury of Foreign Minister Wang. After the speech, the Japanese representative Fangze immediately said that he was deeply sorry upon hearing the news and expressed his deep respect for his friend Foreign Minister Wang. Representative Shi immediately responded that both sides felt the same (meaning that Foreign Minister Wang also had similar respect for Fangze), although the language was quite agile. Later, the Japanese representative read a proposal with the words "Japanese withdrawal of troops," followed by a condition: "but only to the extent that the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people can be guaranteed; all other measures are unnecessary" (meaning that the fact-finding committee does not need to be organized). Shi replied that he was very pleased to hear of the Japanese withdrawal of troops, but he would be even happier if he could know the exact date of the withdrawal. Moreover, after the withdrawal of troops, whether the original state has been restored, whether the arrested personnel can be released, and whether the confiscated property can be returned to the original owners are all things he would be happy to hear. In addition, he must respectfully ask his colleagues whether they have also heard that Japanese planes dropped bombs and destroyed the train on the Pingliao Line (formerly the Beijing-Fengtian Line), and whether the Chinese troops stationed along the train line have been disarmed. If the fact-finding committee is helpful for the smooth success of the troop withdrawal, he wondered if his colleagues believed it should be established. At this time, the Japanese representative held a deep and profound attitude, making people feel that he was highly unpredictable. He did not say a word about the bombing and disarming, but only made a firm declaration rejecting the fact-finding committee, saying that this was a matter for bilateral negotiations and did not require the intervention of a third party. Chinese representative Shi was very experienced and no longer insisted on the previous proposal, but immediately adopted a moderate approach and proposed that the Executive Yuan form a separate committee to supervise the troop withdrawal. The Japanese representative replied that he could telegraph the government for instructions. Seeing that the matter seemed to have a turning point, Shi set up another word to explore it, saying: "Can the confiscated property be returned by your country?" The Japanese representative's attitude was unusually calm, and he replied that he had not received any news. At the same time, the Japanese side suddenly turned its defensive into offensive and declared that this matter should not be participated in by irrelevant parties, and that a committee could be formed jointly by China and Japan. When Shi heard this, he made a startled sound, saying: "Please forgive me, perhaps what I said was not very clear, and the language barrier caused by foreign languages is particularly evident" (which can be said to be a wonderful way to relieve the situation, in fact, Shi's fluency in English is recognized by Westerners). He had succinctly stated that the League of Nations could be his strong arm to make the troop withdrawal in Manchuria a satisfactory solution, so other member states must also participate. British representative Viscount Cecil immediately explained the Chinese representative's words and said that this committee must be organized. If this committee cannot complete its entire task, then the League of Nations should take measures (still taking a moderate approach, neither clinging nor detaching). He continued, "The Chinese representative can add textual descriptions to the various sections of his proposal for the Japanese side to consider." Representative Shi said that he deeply agreed with Viscount Cecil's words. Then, would the committee organized by China and Japan still need other member states to participate? The Japanese representative replied that this was not possible. If China wanted other countries to participate, he would not telegraph his government for instructions. Viscount Cecil then acted as a peacemaker between the two parties, saying that the two gentlemen could still negotiate with each other at this time, and if the supervisory troop withdrawal committee failed, the League of Nations could still engage in mediation. The intricate nature of diplomatic debates is not easy to get through directly. Looking at the history of modern diplomacy, there is nothing like this, and only at this time can the Chinese representative's efforts to beat around the bush be called a diplomatic strategy with clear steps over the past decade since the end of World War I.</p>
<p>Until 4:00 PM on the 30th, the final</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Executive Yuan meeting of this session was held. Chairman Lele declared that for the sake of the alliance, the maintenance of peace should be the most important thing, so Japan's troops must be required to withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway line, but considering the complexity of the situation there, the lives and property of the Japanese must be taken into account. The troop withdrawal must be implemented immediately, and it should also be acknowledged that there are several days of hesitation. For this reason, the resolution is announced as follows: (1) The Executive Yuan has heard the declarations of the representatives of China and Japan. On the one hand, Japan should withdraw its troops, and on the other hand, the lives and property of the Japanese should be protected. (2) The Executive Yuan has ascertained that the governments of China and Japan will do their best to avoid the expansion and deterioration of the case. (3) The Executive Yuan requests China and Japan to do their best to restore the original state and report all handling processes to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan will reconvene on October 14th, and the Chairman of the Executive Yuan may inspect the situation with the representatives present and the representatives of China and Japan. If it is not necessary to hold a meeting at that time, the Chairman has the power to suspend the meeting (it was held one day in advance on October 14th due to the severe situation). Subsequently, the Japanese representative declared that his opinion was that there was no need for special arrangements for reporting matters (meaning that there was no need for a fact-finding committee), and that all countries present in the court could each have their diplomats stationed in the East make reports to the Executive Yuan, etc. Chinese representative Shi ascertained that the Japanese representative's declaration proved that the Japanese side also recognized that reports from an impartial position were indispensable. He also said that he hoped that all Japanese troops would be able to completely withdraw by October 14th and that the local original state could be completely restored. If this could not be done, he must reserve the previous proposal to send an investigation team to Manchuria, and he hoped that this would not happen again. He also had to reserve the following section, that is, if the local area could not be restored to its original state at that time, then the representatives present at the Executive Yuan should determine who should be responsible for this case and estimate the loss and compensation. He only recognized the resolution with the above-mentioned meaning. Upon hearing this, the Japanese representative was unwilling to recognize Representative Shi's final statement, saying that the representative recognized the resolution announced by the Chairman and did not attach the Chinese representative's explanation. The Chairman then tried his best to reconcile, saying that he sincerely hoped that the two sides of China and Japan could come closer and listen to the opinions of the two sides again at the meeting on October 14th, and that there was no need to make a big debate on the interpretation at present, etc. And Representative Shi's additional reservation can be said to be very precise. In short, Japan's advance into Manchuria is detrimental to world peace and sufficient to shake the foundation of the League of Nations. Among the major Western powers, all far-sighted diplomats are unwilling to let go easily. In particular, if there were no China's calm persistence and Representative Shi's proper understanding of the central government's intentions, the long dyke would collapse due to ant nests, and the situation would be irreparably rotten. Japan will be the chief culprit of the world's second war, and even if there are major powers willing to help us, I am afraid that they will be caught off guard. This is what those who know the world situation can say without the need for reporters to elaborate.</p>
<h3>The So-Called Unresolved Cases by the Japanese Are Like This (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Places Where They Claim We Violated the Treaty</p>
<p>Are All One-Sided Reasons from the Japanese</p>
<p>14\. The Case of Obstructing the Management of Mines Along the South Manchurian Railway Line - Regarding the Manchurian Five Cases Agreement of 1909 and based on the outline agreed upon between the Governors of the Three Eastern Provinces and the Consul-General in Fengtian in 1907, the mining affairs along the Anfeng Line could be jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese. China, disregarding the right agreement, obstructed the joint operation of Qingchengzi, Niuxintai, Tianshifu, and other mines. The reason was always that it violated the Mining Regulations. However, the Mining Regulations violated Article 9 of the Anglo-Chinese Commercial Treaty of 1902, and disregarding the principle of extraterritoriality, it obstructed our treaty rights, which was very inappropriate. 15. Denying the Land Acquisition of Fushun Coal Mine Mining Area - According to the Fushun Coal Mine Land Acquisition Regulations, the South Manchurian Railway used the Chinese County Magistrate's mediation to acquire the necessary civilian land for mining acquisition, and with the rise of the movement to prevent the outflow of rights, from 1924 onwards, it refused land acquisition, and in recent years, various tactics have obstructed land acquisition.</p>
<p>16\. Obstructing the South Manchurian Railway's Land Acquisition for the Necessary Construction and Protection of the Railway - The land along the line necessary for the construction, operation, and protection of the railway (according to Article 6 of the Contract for the Construction and Operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway) could naturally be leased by the South Manchurian Railway. However, since 1915, China has vigorously obstructed the South Manchurian Railway's land acquisition, and there are 59 unresolved cases.</p>
<p>17\. Obstructing the Construction of the Iron Ore Transportation Railway in Gongchangling - According to the joint venture contract between the Liaoning Provincial Government and Iide Enitaro's Gongchangling Iron Mine Company, the company's iron ore transportation railway construction was approved. However, last year, the Liaoning Provincial Transportation Committee discussed whether the construction was feasible and denied the vested rights.</p>
<p>18\. Denying the Right to Purchase Clay in Fuzhou - In May 1930, the Fuzhou Mining Co., Ltd., an affiliate of the South Manchurian Railway, with the official permission of the Liaoning Provincial Agricultural and Mining Department, supervised the management of the clay mining rights in Fuzhou Bay and concluded a sales contract with the Fuzhou Bay Clay Mining Company. Until June of this year, Zhou Wenfu, a Chinese national who was granted permission for this matter, was oppressed, and the permission was arbitrarily revoked, causing a negotiation problem.</p>
<p>19\. Confiscation of Mining Certificates for Magu, Niesaido, and Feldspar Mines - In August 1930, according to the request of the Chinese authorities, a tax payment order was issued for the magnesite mining area under the name of the Zhenxing Company. The tax-paid magnesite mine had already been canceled and ordered to pay taxes again, and it was stated in the official document that the taxes paid would be used as iron donations.</p>
<p>20\. Oppressing the Joint Venture Coal Mine in Xi'an - In the Sino-Japanese joint venture to mine coal in Xi'an County, local officials sent police to threaten and prevent people from buying coal on the road where coal was transported.</p>
<p>21\. Cancellation of the Lead Mining Rights in Fengcheng County - For the Sino-Japanese joint venture Qingchengzi Lead Mine in Fengcheng County, the Chinese authorities canceled the mining rights in August 1929 for additional reasons. The Japanese representative protested against these reasons and continued the operation. The Chinese authorities then demanded that the Japanese withdraw and took actions such as detaining the drivers and confiscating horses. Currently, the operation is impossible.</p>
<p>22\. Forcible Recovery of the Talc Mine in Dashiqiao - The former Zixi Talc Mining Area in Dashiqiao, which was operated by Ito Jiro under the name of a Chinese person, was forcibly recovered by the Chinese authorities on July 12, 1929, who prevented coolies from working.</p>
<p>23\. Forcible Recovery of the Limestone Mine in Benxihu - The Japanese had previously entered into a limestone mining contract with the Chinese in the Houchong Limestone Mining Area in Benxihu for more than a decade. The Chinese punished the relevant Chinese who had stolen the land and confiscated the land. In August 1929, they suddenly wanted to forcibly recover it by force.</p>
<p>24\. Oppression of the Benxihu Coal and Iron Company - The lease for the Benxihu water source land expired on November 1, 1927. The South Manchurian Railway negotiated repeatedly to renew the contract, but the future requires the return of the land, and there is still no solution.</p>
<p>25\. Prohibition of Fushun Coal Transportation and Usage Orders - China restricted the transportation of Fushun coal by the Shenhai Railway in 1929 and added pressure to Fushun coal. In 1930, Liu Heling, the Director of the Liaoning Provincial Agricultural and Mining Department, ordered the chambers of commerce, workshops, and other institutions in various counties to prohibit the use of foreign coal except for Chinese coal, which was approved by the Northeast Political Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>26\. Discriminatory Treatment of Domestic Products and Railway Freight - Article 15 of the Wangxia Treaty of 1844 clearly stipulates that there should be no other more harmful restrictions and business restrictions on foreign trade. However, this year, the four northeastern provinces issued a match monopoly system, which hindered the manufacture and import of matches by the Japanese. In addition, Article 5 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty clearly stipulates that there should be no unfair discrimination on all Chinese railways. However, China, disregarding the repeated protests from Japan and foreign countries, handled foreign products in a strange way according to the above regulations and reduced railway freight for domestic products, with differential treatment from foreign countries (Classification Table of Ordinary Goods of the Republic of China Railway). 27. Improper Taxation - According to the treaty, Fengtian City has been opened and should not be considered inland. On this point, there has never been any disagreement among foreign countries since the past. If a commodity that has once been imported into a port and paid import tax, there is no need to pay any other taxes again. However, China defines Fengtian City as Chinese inland and implemented a business tax and a sales tax of 4% this spring. The markets that do not pay the right tax are pressured and obstructed by Chinese traders.</p>
<p>27. Double Taxation in Dalian Port - If goods that have once been imported into a Chinese port are transported to another Chinese port, the drawback system has always been applied to avoid the double burden of tariffs. However, in May 1931, China abolished the drawback system. As a result, except for Dalian, a tax-free certificate is issued at the export port for exports from Chinese ports, which is the same as the implementation of the drawback, which can avoid the double burden of duty. Dalian is the only one that does not issue a tax-free certificate. Although Japan has repeatedly requested it, China has refused to recognize it.</p>
<p>28. Improper Increase in Fushun Coal Export Tax - The regulations for the Fushun Yantai coal mine stipulate that one tael of export tax silver should be paid per ton. This agreement was valid from 1911 to 1927. China unilaterally imposed a new export tax from June 1 of this year. Japan pointed out that it violated the treaty and the negotiation has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>29. Improper Taxation in the South Manchurian Railway Affiliated Areas - China has no right to tax the affiliated areas of the South Manchurian Railway, as our country has absolute and exclusive administrative power over them under the treaty. However, China will levy a business tax on Chinese residents living in the affiliated areas, which was prevented by Japan. It also forcibly collected foreign taxes in the affiliated areas and levied a business tax of 2% and a production tax of 3% on goods moved out of the affiliated areas. In order to prevent tax evasion, it oppressed the Chinese by imposing fines and placing surveillance personnel at the borders of the affiliated areas, using all means to force tax payments. The same methods were also adopted for Japanese goods.</p>
<p>30. Oppression of the Harbin North Manchurian Electric Company - The Harbin North Manchurian Electric Company was established in 1922. In 1920, the Harbin City Council granted a special permit for the operation of the electric business. However, as it had already been in operation, in 1920, the Harbin City Council prevented the outflow of rights when the North Manchurian Electric Company was granted a special franchise for the operation of trams and electric lights, and established the Harbin Electric Company with official-merchant cooperation to unreasonably obtain the franchise. Since May 1930, it has purely changed to official operation and oppressed the expansion of other North Manchurian Electric Companies regarding the infringement of the sovereignty of official operations.</p>
<p>31. The Anti-Japanese Decision on Bidding for Railway Materials - When the Shenhai Railway publicly bid for ten new locomotives in August 1929, the South Manchurian Railway won the first place and Mitsubishi won the second place. However, due to anti-Japanese motives, they changed to purchasing from the Skoda factory.</p>
<p>32. Obstructing the Forests in Jilin Province - The mountains along the Jidun Railway, such as Guangcailing and Laoye, are covered by virgin forests. In 1930, the Jilin Provincial authorities suddenly banned logging in this area, which dealt a heavy blow to the construction of the Jidun Line by Japan and timber traders.</p>
<p>33. Oppression of the Zhamian Company - The Zhamian Company in the Xing'anling Mountains in Heilongjiang Province was funded by the South Manchurian Railway with 2 million yuan. China denied the fact of the investment and demanded a huge investment from the South Manchurian Railway, failing to implement the aftermath measures for the Zhamian Forest Area between the South Manchurian Railway and Heilongjiang Province in 1925 and obstructed it with force.</p>
<p>34. Trampling on the Contract for Loans for Forests and Mines in Jilin and Heilongjiang - A loan contract of 30 million yuan was concluded with the Ministry of Finance of the Beijing Government and the Chinese Exchange Bank on August 2, 1918, using the gold mines and state-owned forests of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and their income as collateral. China not only failed to fulfill the contract items, but also denied the loan attitude to this day.</p>
<p>35. Denying the Advance Payment of 10 Million Yuan for the Ji-Hui Railway - Based on the Ji-Hui Railway Agreement of April 15, 1907, and the Jiandao Agreement of September 4, 1909, the Japanese side's three banks and the Ministry of Communications of the Chinese government concluded a preliminary loan contract for the Ji-Hui Railway on June 18, 1918, and paid 10 million yuan to the Chinese government in advance. China instead showed an attitude of avoiding the construction of the Ji-Hui Railway and denied the loan.</p>
<p>36. Overturning the Jidun Line Rail Fees - The South Manchurian Railway and the Jidun Railway Bureau agreed to conclude a formal loan contract and paid 900,000 yuan for the rail price in April 1928, but no contract has been concluded to this day.</p>
<p>37. Overturning the Coal Price of the Beining Railway - The Beining Railway Bureau owes the South Manchurian Railway about 634,000 yuan for Fushun coal prices. After repeated urging by the South Manchurian Railway, especially compared with other matters, it only paid 20,000 yuan per day, which has not been completed.</p>
<h3>The 19th Route Army Starts from Ganzhou</h3>
<p>The Ganzhou Public Association Requests That the Army Stay to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>If They Cannot Stay, Please Send Another Army to Take Over the Defense</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the Central Government appointed Chen Mingshu as the Garrison Commander of the Beijing-Shanghai area, Chen immediately telegraphed the 66th and 1st Divisions of the 19th Route Army to concentrate in Ganzhou and head to Beijing and Shanghai. Yesterday, a letter from Ganzhou stated that the army had been moving eastward along the Gan River since the 15th, but due to traffic obstruction and the presence of small groups of scattered bandits along the way, the march was extremely slow. As for the southern Jiangxi area, Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, and other forces are currently gathering in Huichang, Ruijin, Yudu, An’yuan, and other counties on the border of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong, and are constantly threatening to attack Ganzhou. Kong Shaoyao, Chairman of the Ganzhou Party and Government Branch, and various public associations have separately telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Minister He, requesting that they send another large force to take over the defense to save the millions of disaster-stricken people in southern Jiangxi. The original telegram is as follows: (1) Since the 19th Route Army was ordered to suppress bandits, it has achieved remarkable results. The victory in the Gao Yuwei battle not only killed over ten thousand bandits and intimidated them, but also provided significant protection to the people of southern Jiangxi. Now that the army is recuperating in Ganzhou, the voices of welcome are incessant. However, according to reliable reports, large groups of red bandits led by Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang have gathered in Ruijin, Yudu, Huichang, An’yuan, and other counties. The vanguard of the bandit troops has advanced to Xinpi Shanmen Tan and other places in Yudu, posing a great threat to Ganzhou. Millions of people in southern Jiangxi are extremely worried that the 19th Route Army will be transferred elsewhere, and the red bandits will take the opportunity to attack. We earnestly request that you consider the millions of disaster-stricken people in southern Jiangxi and allow the 19th Route Army to remain stationed in Ganzhou to assist in the suppression of bandits. If the army must be transferred elsewhere, please send another large force to Ganzhou to assist Ma’s brigade in the defense. We would be immensely grateful. Kong Shaoyao, Chairman of the Ganzhou District Branch Committee; Zhang Dexin, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce; the Joint Office of the United Association of Secondary Schools of Southern Jiangxi; and the Refugee Group of the Seventeen Counties, respectfully kowtow in the cold. (2) The major bandit forces of Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang have approached Ganzhou from Ruijin and Yudu. Recently, the various units of the 19th Route Army have been successively withdrawn, leaving the defense of Ganzhou weak and extremely dangerous. We earnestly request that you quickly send a large army to reinforce the defense to save the critical situation. Ganzhou Chamber of Commerce and all the people respectfully kowtow in the cold. (Seal) October 30th.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Explosion at the Jinan New City Arsenal</h3>
<p>More Than a Dozen Workers Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jinan Arsenal of the Ministry of Military Affairs is located in the New City north of Jinan. Attached to the factory is a mine and explosives depot, with two buildings behind the factory serving as a place for filling mortar shells and landmines. This department has eighteen workers. At 9:00 AM today (30th), during work, one worker was careless when filling explosives, and suddenly a shell exploded, shooting light in all directions. With a loud bang, the two warehouses were completely destroyed, and all the workers inside, except for one who was outside, were buried in the soil. Four people were killed, their bodies incomplete, and twelve were seriously injured, all with scorched faces and mutilated limbs. They were immediately taken to the Puli Gate Hospital outside Puli Gate for treatment by Dr. Lu Huafeng. It is said that their lives are in danger. One person was slightly injured and is not in serious condition. Currently, the entire factory has suspended work, and workers are digging through the ash and soil to find corpses. Additional guards have been dispatched outside the factory, refusing anyone from entering the factory for investigation. Furthermore, it is reported that the exploded part of the New City Arsenal was the second factory, the room being the workshop for assembling detonators (the shell contained a detonator as thin as a cigarette containing white explosives). On that day, workers were filling explosives into the detonators, and due to excessive friction, the explosives detonated, killing the worker filling the explosives instantly. Two others next to him were also killed at the same time, one surnamed Sun, one surnamed Gao, and one surnamed Tong. According to Section Chief Zhu of the factory, the explosives are extremely powerful. The explosion collapsed the roof of the room and crushed another person to death. The most seriously injured were three people, seriously injured were two people, and slightly injured were seven people. The loss of explosives was only one pound. All the injured were taken to the Puli Gate Hospital for treatment by Hu Tianyi, Director of the Arsenal, and Pan Xianzhu, Director. (October 30th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Another Bandit with a Bounty is Captured: The Taihu bandit A-Shu disturbed the coastal counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces last year. After the joint suppression by the military and police, most of the ringleaders were arrested and executed. A few still remain at large, and the military and police are still conducting a strict investigation. It is now learned that a tailor named A-Jin, known for his strength and recklessness, was an important wingman of Taihu bandit A-Shu. The bandit suppression headquarters had offered a bounty of 500 yuan for him. It has now been discovered that he was hiding in Shanghai. Fan Guozhong, captain of the First Water Police Team, and Company Commander Zhou Liancheng arrested him at the small vegetable market on Henan Road in Shanghai this morning. They immediately escorted him to the North Station, took a train to Songjiang, and boarded a boat back to the Zhujing team headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Abducted Child from the Liudu Base is Rescued: Quanfa, the ten-year-old son of Han Liansheng, a farmer from the Liudu base in the city of Dazhangjing, was kidnapped last month. Almost a month has passed, and now, based on reports from informants, Captain Fan Guozhong of the Water Police successfully solved the case last night at No. 1041 Yangshupu Road in Shanghai, rescuing the abducted hostage Han Quanfa. He was taken back to the Zhujing team headquarters. The kidnappers have not yet been apprehended. It is reported that the child is mentally exhausted, likely due to prolonged confinement in the bandit's den and excessive mental stimulation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Issue of Smuggled Enemy Goods in Cigarette Boxes: The Inspection Department of the Wuxi Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association recently discovered eight boxes of enemy goods deposited by Wu Wenxuan, manager of the Feng Taiyuan foreign goods store, in the Nanyang Company warehouse outside the North Gate of Dunren Lane. The National Salvation Association has resolved to punish the Nanyang Company as well. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Branch of the local Cigarette Exchange Association submitted a report to the Party Headquarters requesting a thorough investigation and sent a letter to the Nanyang General Company requesting the dismissal of Jin Shisun, the manager in Wuxi. After receiving the letter, the General Company sent personnel to Wuxi yesterday to investigate. It was confirmed that the smuggling was not done by the company or Jin Shisun, but was deposited by Wu Wenxuan. The findings of the investigation have been reported truthfully.</p>
<p>A Sudden Robbery at the Nanshu Mountain Temple: The Nanshu Mountain Temple at the mouth of Taihu Lake is usually very popular. A wealthy gentleman recently moored his boat there to fulfill a vow, donating one hundred silver dollars for the decoration of the statue. From the lake, bandits eyed that contribution, and around twelve o'clock that night, more than ten lake bandits suddenly broke down the door and entered, looting the boxes and searching at will. After inspection, it was found that the donated one hundred silver dollars had been completely robbed.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>A Crew Member Seduced and Raped a Female Passenger: When the Hengtong ship, traveling north, set sail early on the 31st, a single female passenger named Xu Yan, around twenty years old, wearing a modified cheongsam, boarded the ship bound for Shaobo. The berths in the stern cabin were full, and a crew member named Chen Zhongxin seduced her into the lower cabin under the pretext of finding her a seat. He then produced a stack of ghost money and asked her for sexual favors. The woman screamed loudly, and the entire ship knew. Chen was arrested and taken to the Fourth Police Station in Yangzhou for interrogation, then transferred to the First Police Bureau for clarification and finally to the Public Security Bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The County Government Executes the Bandit Leader of Yuyu District: Shi Daoxian, the bandit leader of Yuyu District in Nantong, had committed repeated acts of arson, robbery, and murder.

<p>Organizational Measures for the Provisional Court: The County Government, upon receiving an order from the High Court to investigate counter-revolutionary prisoners in custody who meet the criteria of the Emergency Law for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China, shall submit a report within seven days to request personnel to be dispatched to Tongzhou to organize a provisional court for trial.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Framing Through Dropped Packages, Sent to the Bureau for Investigation: Wu Yanchi and Zhang Dongzhou, two out-of-town guests, stayed at the Dingxin Inn in the South Gate of the city last night. Around 10:00 PM, Zhou, a patrolman from the Public Security Section, suddenly led police to search the inn and found a piece of opium. Wu and Zhang were immediately detained by the bureau and fined eighty silver dollars. Later, Li Qingshan, adjutant of the 25th Route Army stationed in Gaoyou, discovered the inside story and sent a team to arrest Tai Jiayuan, who was responsible for framing them. Tai was sent to the Public Security Section for interrogation. After interrogation by Section Chief Zhang, he confessed to dropping the package out of spite. It is reported that Section Chief Zhang intends to send the criminal to the county court for handling.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou</h3>
<p>An Incident of Goods Inspection Occurs: After the establishment of the National Salvation Association by the Student Union of Xuzhou, they have been working extremely hard on anti-Japanese activities. Volunteer troops have been established separately, and Boy Scouts are also intensifying their training. On the morning of the 30th, over a thousand students from all secondary military schools in the city set out to inspect Japanese goods. The Japanese goods stored in various stores had already been registered by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and were now being inspected according to the records to prevent further imports. However, the case, which was not resolved in the standing committee meeting of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association the day before, limited the sale of Japanese goods stored in each business to within twenty days, after which they would be confiscated, was leaked to the outside world, causing a misunderstanding among the business community. Some merchants incited the four industries of Southern Goods, Silk, Cotton Yarn, and Guangci to go on strike. At that time, students had gathered at the Public Education Center and marched in formation to the Chamber of Commerce to question them. Chairman Lan Bohua of the Chamber of Commerce happened to be away from Xuzhou, and the committee members were also not at the meeting. Representatives of various groups arrived and invited Hu a representative of the Chamber of Commerce, to mediate and explain the misunderstanding to the four industries. It was decided that representatives of various groups would participate in the inspection and notify the various industries to open for business. They set off from the Chamber of Commerce in four groups: one group to inspect Daixinghua, one group to inspect Yuanhengli, one group to inspect Yangtaiji, and one group to inspect Hongchangshun, with very orderly procedures. However, when the fourth group inspected Hongchangshun, the shop owner, Zhang Tingxian, who was currently an executive committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, was nowhere to be found, and the shop refused inspection and closed its doors. The students lined up in front of the door, extremely agitated. Later, Gao Yufu, the chief of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, opened the door. The students declared that they would no longer inspect and brought the person in charge of the shop to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to discuss punishment and sealed the shop door. The other three groups completed the inspection in the evening. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held an emergency meeting that night to discuss how to punish Hongchangshun. The county government also convened a meeting of various industries that night to decide to resume business completely and accept inspection. The concrete incident of goods inspection can be considered resolved. However, the aftermath of Hongchangshun remains to be handled (31st).</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>A Grand Anti-Japanese Patriotic Parade by Women: Due to the increasingly outrageous bestial acts of the violent Japanese, women's organizations in Hangzhou, in addition to organizing women's rescue and training teams, held a women's anti-Japanese patriotic parade at the People's Stadium at 2:00 PM on November 1st. Over 5,000 women from various schools, organizations, factories attended. Xu Biyun, Chairman of the Provincial Girls' High School, reported on the purpose. Xiang Dingrong, representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Xu Yuanpu, representative of the Education Department, and others gave speeches. Two proposals were passed on the spot: to telegraph the representatives of the Beijing-Guangdong peace conference to quickly determine a counter-Japanese strategy and to telegraph all female compatriots across the country to rise up and save the country. The entire group set off and paraded for a week along a prescribed route, dispersing at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Bandits Burn Down an Ancient Temple: The Chayuan Hermitage, an ancient temple behind Songlin Xiyan in Fenghua, was suddenly attacked by three or four bandits the other day. The hermitage was burned down for an hour, turning it completely into scorched earth. A total of 24 rooms in the hermitage and several paper mills were burned down, resulting in a loss of seven or eight thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Posthumous Honors for the Martyred County Magistrate: When the county town of Yingshan in Anhui Province was captured by the Red Army, Huang Dianwen, the county magistrate, and a certain regimental commander and two county consolidation committee members were brutally killed. The provincial government has recently appointed Hu Haikun, who was recommended by various groups in the county, as the successor county magistrate. At a regular meeting of the provincial government on the 30th, it was decided that in addition to the usual posthumous honors for Huang Dianwen's family, the Finance Department would allocate 1,000 yuan for funeral expenses.</p>
<p>Allocation of Personnel Passing the Higher Civil Service Examination in Anhui: The Ministry of Personnel of the National Government recently notified the Anhui Provincial Government to assign Ye Pei, Chen Qingmei, and Zhang Dengshou, three individuals who passed the first Higher Civil Service Examination, to serve in Anhui. Ye, who passed the general administrative examination, has been assigned to the Civil Affairs Department by the provincial government. Chen and Zhang, who passed the educational administrative examination, have been assigned to the Education Department.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>A Crashed Airplane is Transported to Nanjing for Repair: An airplane sent by the Central Aviation Administration to Hanchuan, Henan Province, to scout for bandits lost its way and crashed in Jin Datang, east of Hefei, due to fuel exhaustion. The Aviation Administration subsequently sent two more planes, which, although they located the site, could not land safely and only dropped a letter instructing to quickly strengthen the new airfield and hang signs to facilitate landing for repair. The injured pilot, Captain He, and driver Huang have fully recovered. Due to the severe damage to the fuselage, fuel tank, right wing, and tail, the aircraft was disassembled on the 27th and loaded onto a small cart for transportation to Nanjing for repair.</p>
<p>Educational News Highlights</p>
<h3>Jiangsu's Education Funds and the Funds of National Central University Are Both in Dire Straits</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the Ministry of Finance has agreed to subsidize Jiangsu Province with 600,000 yuan</p>
<p>Before the 16th year of the Republic, Jiangsu's education funds were fully funded by the special tobacco tax. At the end of the 16th year, when Gu Yingfen was the Minister of Finance, the special tobacco tax was taken over by the ministry, and a portion of the land tax and slaughter tax that Jiangsu Province should have remitted to the treasury was used to offset the education funds. At that time, the Jiangsu education community felt that the collection and remittance of land tax was difficult and often had shortfalls, and they had unsuccessfully appealed to the Ministry of Finance. Later, after the mediation of Wu Zhihui and other veterans of the education community, the Ministry of Finance clearly stated that if Jiangsu's education funds were insufficient, the Ministry of Finance would provide an annual subsidy of 600,000 yuan as a standard. However, several years have passed, and National Central University has not provided any assistance to Jiangsu's education funds. Moreover, when the university district system was abolished, the Executive Yuan meeting decided that 1.32 million yuan of National Central University's funds would be permanently allocated from Jiangsu's education funds, and the shortfall would be covered by a monthly allocation of 50,000 yuan from the central government. This caused disputes and panic among the primary and secondary education communities in Jiangsu regarding education funds. The underlying cause of the undercurrents in Jiangsu's education community over the years has been nothing more than the uneven distribution of education funds. When Jiangsu Province prepared the education budget for the 20th year during the summer vacation this year, the Education Funds Committee held two meetings in Zhenjiang and twice resolved to stop allocating funds to National Central University (the resolutions on the funds of National Central University in the records of the two Education Funds Committee meetings were not officially published). Although Zhu Jiahua, president of National Central University, attended and strongly argued at the Education Funds Committee meeting on July 25th, there were no concrete results. This is why the education funds auditors have refused to sign the funds of National Central University since May, and National Central University has not been able to receive Jiangsu's funds for nearly five months. Last month, the Jiangsu Provincial Party and Government Joint Conference raised the funds of National Central University for discussion, all believing that the province's education funds of more than 4 million were seriously affected by the severe floods this year. Due to the poor harvest in various counties, the income from land tax was likely to be less than half, and it was already difficult to maintain the funds of primary and secondary schools and social education institutions. It was really difficult to afford the funds of National Central University. Based on the above resolution, the provincial government submitted a report to the Executive Yuan requesting that the annual 1.32 million yuan of National Central University's funds be borne by the central government from the 20th year. After receiving the report, the Executive Yuan instructed the Ministries of Finance and Education to jointly review and reply. National Central University's funds were thus fundamentally shaken. Since June, it has only relied on the monthly allocation of 50,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance to maintain itself, resulting in arrears in salaries for teachers and staff for three months and extreme difficulties in the operation of the university. It is reported that the university had previously considered a strike to demand the arrears, but due to the current situation, they had to continue classes for the time being. The Student Union of the university, seeing the instability of the university funds, also submitted a request to the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters for assistance and elected representatives to petition the Ministry of Education. Although the Ministry of Education promised to do its best to maintain it, its power fell short of its will. In the past two days (29th and 30th), it repeatedly sent personnel to discuss with the Ministry of Finance. As a result, the Ministry of Finance deeply understood the difficulties of both National Central University and Jiangsu's education funds. However, during this time of national crisis, the financial difficulties were also a reality. How could it afford to bear more burdens? At most, the Ministry of Finance could only subsidize Jiangsu's education funds with 600,000 yuan annually. As for the 1.32 million yuan of National Central University's funds, it was still requested that the Executive Yuan instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Government to handle it in accordance with the resolution of the Executive Yuan. It is reported that the Ministries of Finance and Education will submit this intention to the Executive Yuan, and whether this 600,000 yuan subsidy will be allocated from the 20th year still needs to be considered based on the state treasury situation, according to Minister Song's final decision.</p>
<h3>High Schools and Above Should Step Up Military Training</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has issued a program for high schools and above to step up military training, in addition to ordering directly subordinate high schools and above, and also notifying the education departments of various provinces and cities, which was approved by the General Training Supervision Department. The order from the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, No. Canzi 508, stated, "To comply with the order, since the Japanese army occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, schools and organizations in the inland provinces have risen up to engage in anti-Japanese movements. Their patriotism is commendable, but the will of the masses is not uniform, and their psychology is different, making it easy to go astray. The vigor of young people makes it easy to go to extremes. If preventive measures are not taken in advance, once incited by villains, their studies will be abandoned, leading to social unrest and affecting security and diplomacy. In order to maintain stability, strengthen education, and resolve the anti-Japanese policy on the right track, it is hereby ordered that the General Supervision Department instruct all schools in the country to step up military training, increase the time for operations, and appropriately add necessary courses on literature and military affairs during spare time. Students should concentrate on their studies and increase their military knowledge. They should not engage in parades and propaganda and should strive to save the country through academic pursuits. The future of the Party and the country will have hope. Each should respectfully comply and not violate this order." This was followed by an oral instruction from Chairman Chiang of the National Government to the director of the National Military Education Department of the ministry on the 25th of last month, ordering him to step up military training in high schools and above. The content was roughly the same as before and should be followed. A program for stepping up military training and a plan for the first phase of stepping up training were immediately drafted and submitted to the National Government for approval. The required supplementary military instructors were also approved to be selected and recruited from the senior classes of the Central Military Academy and the Constitutional Police Class, including 119 regular members such as Zhang Yu and 60 alternate members such as Jiang Jipu. The students of the military officer education company, including Feng Yuyong, were transferred. Four thousand six hundred and thirty guns were approved to be allocated for the required training. This accelerated training is stipulated to be completed within a limited time. The salaries of the temporary instructors were also approved to be issued by the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and transferred to the Ministry of Education. However, military education in schools in non-accelerated training areas will continue to be conducted in accordance with the regulations. In addition to how to allocate the supplementary military instructors, a separate case will be notified. A copy of the accelerated military training program and a list of the selected and transferred military instructors are attached for review and instructions. The training program is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Procedures: (Phase 1) All high schools and above in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will uniformly step up military training. (Phase 2) High schools and above in important areas that have already implemented military training will step up military training. (Phase 3) High schools and above in all areas that have implemented military training but do not belong to the first and second phases will uniformly step up military training. (Phase 4) All high schools and above in areas outside the first, second, and third phases will uniformly step up military training.</p>
<p>The above phases will be carried out gradually in order, with each phase limited to six months to complete the training. After the completion of the first phase of training, the second phase will begin. When the second phase is completed, the third and fourth phases will be carried out in turn. During the accelerated training period of each phase, the original military instructors should continue to implement it in accordance with the regulations to avoid interruption.</p>
<p>(2) Methods: (1) Convene the current military instructors of high schools and above and the military instructors to be added for accelerated training to implement two weeks of training (the course schedule will be determined separately). (2) After the military instructors have completed their training, the General Training Supervision Department will, in accordance with the procedures, jointly with the Ministry of Education, send them to various schools to begin training. (3) All instructors added for accelerated training, except for the regular instructors, will have their salaries paid by the General Training Supervision Department. (4) After the first phase of training is completed, all instructors added for accelerated training will be transferred by the General Training Supervision Department and the Ministry of Education to schools that should be trained in the second phase. The training will be implemented. The following will be handled in the same way.</p>
<p>(3) Training: (1) Two hours of training per day. (2) Complete recruit training in the first two months. Complete the education of soldiers of all levels in the third and fourth months. Complete the education of military ten in the fifth and sixth months. (3) The flag-raising and flag-lowering ceremonies should be held in accordance with the regulations every day, and the slogans stipulated by the central government should be shouted at the morning meeting every day. (4) The rest should be handled in accordance with the education outline of the student volunteer army issued by the central government.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Stops Registering Students Returning from Japan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education telegraphed the Supervisor's Office for Students in Japan, saying, "We have ordered students returning to the country to register and sent them to various schools for auditing. We still ask you to persuade students in Japan to continue their studies. If they return to the country again, the Ministry will not maintain them and will not allow them to register. Please submit the list of students who have returned to the country to the Ministry." At the same time, the Ministry telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government, saying, "Regarding the petition of students studying in Japan to return to the country, the Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed the Supervisor's Office for Students in Japan to persuade them to continue their studies and not return to the country. The students who have returned to the country have been ordered to register in accordance with the registration method and sent to various schools for auditing. The registration date has been closed on the 28th of this month. Registration will not be allowed afterwards. If there are unreasonable demands, they will be ignored. Please check and forward this order to the Education Bureau." It is reported that a total of 152 students studying in Japan who have been registered by the Ministry of Education have been temporarily sent to various public and private universities as auditors.</p>

<h3>The First Round of the Scotto Cup: Jinan Defeats the British Navy</h3>
<p>Eliminating the Sailors by Seven to One</p>
<p>Qiu Dongyan Scores Four Goals</p>
<p>The Jinan University football team eliminated the British Navy by seven to one at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon and entered the second week of the Scotto Cup. Although it was a one-sided game, there were still two to three thousand spectators. The first half was five to zero, and the second half was two to one. The Navy attacked fiercely in the second half, and in the last minute, they managed to score a goal.</p>
<h3>Jinan Lineup</h3>
<p>Liang Shutang Liu Zukan</p>

<h3>As Desired</h3>
<p>Jinan's breakthrough of the Navy was as desired in the first half, as if they were entering an uninhabited land. At the beginning of the game, two minutes after the Navy kicked off, Qiu Dongyan scored a goal. Luo Haiguang then took a long shot from 25 yards away from the goal, hitting the net again, making it two to zero. Chen Zhenxiang and Qiu Dongyan then scored again, making it four to zero. The Navy was no match. Mei Hongbao advanced from the right, but Taul could not stop him. He hooked the ball towards the center, and Scrimshaw headed it, but Haiguang saw that it was a good opportunity and also jumped up and headed it into the net, making it five to zero in the first half.</p>
<h3>The Cornered Beast Still Fights</h3>
<p>One minute into the second half, Qiu Dongyan scored again, making it six goals. Although the Navy's goalkeeper was unable to fully perform his duties, the forwards were very active. The Jinan goal was almost lost several times. Jinan's attacking power gradually waned. Shortly before the end of the game, Liu Zukan advanced from the left and Luo Haiguang received the ball and shot. The ball rebounded off Miller's foot, and Qiu Dongyan followed up and scored another goal, making it seven and breaking the dull atmosphere. In the last minute, the Navy also managed to score. 克列生 received a pass from 薛麥斯 and shot fiercely at 温's goal. The Navy did not return completely defeated, ending the game at 7-1.</p>

<h3>French Chamber of Commerce Clay Court Tennis Open Singles: Zheng Zhaojia Wins Over 特克 to Secure Final Spot</h3>
<p>8-6, 7-5. Veteran Submits.</p>
<p>德孚 Wins Over Gao Huimin. Zheng and 德 Will Compete in the Final on Sunday.</p>
<p>Doubles: The Two Zhengs Also Win. The Competition Continues Today and Tomorrow.</p>
<p>The clay court tennis championship of the French Chamber of Commerce has six young Chinese participants: Zheng Zhaojia, Zheng Tuikai, Chen Guocheng, Yu Tianguang, Ma Anquan, and Gao Huimin. The competition started on the 24th of last month and the finals will be held this Saturday and Sunday. Zheng Zhaojia made a splash, defeating veteran 特克 yesterday with a score of 8-6, 7-5 to secure a spot in the final. In doubles, Zheng teamed up with Zheng Tuikai and also won against Yu Tianguang and Ma Anquan with a score of 6-3, 6-4. In the singles semi-finals, Gao Huimin lost to 德孚 with a score of 6-4, 6-3. Zheng will compete against 德孚 in the final on Sunday. The results, order, and details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Little Zheng is Formidable</h3>
<p>After being away for years, the young tennis player has returned from Guling with significantly improved skills. He defeated 惠特 in one match and then defeated the two veterans 特克, who surrendered at the mere sight of him. It is deeply hoped that he can emulate the American 凡恩 this Sunday, fiercely defeat 德孚, who once dominated the court and even defeated Qiu Lin. Zheng once defeated 德孚 in Guling, so avenging Qiu Lin is not an impossible task. There is also great hope in doubles. However, Gao Huimin has already fallen victim to 德's venom.</p>

<p>The Beijing-Guangdong Representatives Held Talks Yesterday</p>
<p>Three Provisional Methods for the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, and Others Have Gone to Beijing to Report</p>
<p>The Sixth Peace Preparatory Meeting Postponed to the 4th</p>
<p>Chen Jitang Telegraphed the Guangdong Representatives to Insist on Consistent Advocacy</p>
<p>The Beijing-Guangdong Peace and Unification Conference announced a two-day recess after the fifth preparatory meeting the day before yesterday. Beijing representatives Zhang Ji and Wu Tiecheng, among others, were scheduled to go to Beijing on Saturday evening to report on the progress of the continuous meetings and to discuss party affairs. However, this was temporarily suspended due to the matters related to the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session. Instead, they continued the talks with the Guangdong representatives at Mr. Wu's residence on Gordon Road yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to discuss party affairs. As a result, regarding the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session, they agreed on three provisional methods. Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Jingjiang, and Chen Mingshu departed for Beijing last night to discuss the matter. They are also expected to take the night train to Shanghai on the 3rd, and the sixth meeting has been postponed to the morning of the 4th. By then, the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session should be resolved. The latest news obtained yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Details and Results of the Talks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's talks began at around 10:00 AM. Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Chen Youren, and Li Wenfan attended the meeting, except for Zou Lu, who was ill and did not attend. On the Nanjing side, in addition to Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Mingshu, and Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin also attended as an observer. The representatives from both sides were not bound by the formalities of the meeting and spoke freely until around 12:00 PM. As a result, it was reported that the focus of party affairs was entirely on the date and location of the Fourth National Congress, which was a more difficult issue. However, three provisional methods have been drafted, and Zhang and Wu will go to Beijing for consultations before holding the sixth meeting to make a decision.</p>
<h3>Zhang, Wu, Chen, and Others Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>After yesterday's talks, the Nanjing representatives publicly recommended Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Mingshu to take the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing at 11:45 PM last night to report to Chiang Kai-shek and discuss the three methods that had been determined, so that they could return to Shanghai and continue the sixth preparatory meeting to make a decision.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Meeting Postponed by One Day</h3>
<p>The sixth preparatory meeting of the Beijing-Guangdong Peace and Unification Conference was originally scheduled to be held on the morning of the 3rd after the Nanjing representatives arrived in Shanghai. However, since Zhang and Wu needed to take the night train to Beijing on the 3rd and would arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 4th, it was agreed with the Guangdong representatives to postpone it by one day and hold it at the same location at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Telegraphed the Guangdong Representatives</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 1st), a certain newspaper in this city reported that Chen Jitang advocated abolishing the Guangdong government. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency believed that this matter was of great importance to unification, so they made special efforts to investigate the truth. It is now known that the Guangdong representatives received a telegram from Chen Jitang, Deng Zheru, Xiao Focheng, Ma Chaojun, and others in Guangdong, expressing their unanimous will for peaceful unification and urging them to work hard to implement the proposals agreed upon in Guangdong and to seek permanent peace and unification. According to this, the rumors about Chen Jitang are not true.</p>
<h3>Wang Sent a Letter to the Shanghai Minbao</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei's letter to the Shanghai Minbao reads: "To the esteemed reporters of the Shanghai Minbao, I have recently seen that your newspaper has published articles from the 18th year of the Republic and I am very moved. However, the peace talks have now begun, and it is inappropriate to publish articles containing offensive language, as it would hinder the process. I would like to request that your newspaper delete the offensive language. As for the entire article, it is acceptable to sincerely meet with comrades here. I have briefly reviewed the articles from recent years and found that only one or two percent of each article contains offensive language, while the rest are merely proposals for the Party and the country. Therefore, if your newspaper would heed my suggestion and delete the offensive language in the articles, it would be a very fair approach. I specially request your attention and consideration. Respectfully, Wang Zhaoming, November 1st."</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai Flew to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, arrived in Shanghai by plane at 3:15 PM yesterday (the 1st) after visiting Chiang Kai-shek in Beijing. He landed at Hongqiao Airport, where Chen Mingshu drove to meet him and they returned to their residence together. When a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met Mr. Cai at a certain place yesterday and asked when the 19th Route Army would arrive in Beijing and Shanghai, Cai said that the army was currently departing from Ji'an, Jiangxi, and heading north, and was on its way.</p>
<h3>Fang Zhenwu Will Reside in Shanghai for a Long Time</h3>
<p>Fang Zhenwu, the former governor of Anhui Province, has been living in seclusion since arriving in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday (the 1st), according to Fang's attendants, Fang consulted a Western doctor yesterday and had an X-ray examination. The doctor said that there were abnormalities in his internal organs and that he needed a long period of rest. Fang visited Hu Zhantang at the Hu residence on Myers Road yesterday and talked for more than an hour before leaving. It is heard that he plans to rent a house for a long time after his wife arrives in Shanghai in the next few days, so that he can receive medical treatment in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Will Soon Return to Guangxi</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong came to Shanghai with the Guangdong delegation a few days ago to support peaceful unification. At the same time, his younger sister will be getting married in Shanghai on the 7th of this month, so he came to preside over the wedding. It is now heard that Mr. Huang plans to return to Guangxi as soon as the peaceful unification is largely settled, after his younger sister's auspicious day. The Guangxi provincial government recently telegraphed Huang, urging him to return to handle land reclamation, and the plan has been finalized, and they urgently hope that Huang will return to Guangxi to preside over it. The land reclamation method in Guangxi Province is funded by the Guangxi provincial government with 10 million yuan, which will be implemented over five years. 1 million yuan will be allocated in the first year, and then 500,000 yuan will be added each year until the fifth year, reaching 10 million yuan. It is now estimated that only 5 yuan is needed per acre of reclaimed land, and 10 million yuan can reclaim 2 million acres of land. After five years, continued land reclamation will not require additional fundraising, as the income from the land reclamation project can be allocated to the land reclamation project. It is estimated that the annual income of the entire province will increase by at least 30 to 40 million yuan at this time. Mr. Huang has been most concerned about the construction of this province in recent years, and this plan was also proposed by him. It has been approved by the Guangxi provincial government and is scheduled to be implemented this winter. Therefore, Mr. Huang is eager to return to Guangxi.</p>

The Independent Regiment's First Regiment's First and Third Battalions and the Second Regiment's Third Regiment all had about 1,000 people.

<h3>Opening of the Meeting and Oath-Taking</h3>

<h3>Opening Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Ye Huijun gave an opening speech saying, "Today, the Volunteer Army committee members and officers and soldiers of the whole city are holding an inauguration ceremony and a military parade, and the spirit is very good. It is not easy to achieve this success in a short period of time. Our Volunteer Army must have one goal, which is the goal of resisting Japan. Therefore, we must be able to become the government's backing in a short period of time. This training of the Volunteer Army is an automatic action of the people and is not organized by persuasion or coercion. We should be able to embrace the spirit of sacrifice. Mr. Wu Mai encouraged us that the enthusiasm of our army should not only be 4.9 minutes, but at least 5 minutes. This statement is so poignant and profound. We must not only maintain 5 minutes, but also maintain it for 50 minutes, and even for 5 days, 5 months, 5 years, and endlessly, so that it will exist forever and be a pillar of the country forever."</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Next, Presidium member Li Cishan gave a report saying that Shanghai is the center of Chinese culture, economy, and transportation, and its terrain is very important. Being able to defend Shanghai means being able to defend China. China is being invaded everywhere, which is not a big problem. Losing Shanghai is a big problem. Our army must consolidate our Shanghai defenses so that not a single inch of Shanghai's territory is lost. Defending Shanghai is indeed the most important responsibility of our army. The plan of our army is to imitate the conscription system and train ten regiments of soldiers in the first phase, so that all people in Shanghai can receive military training in the future. Once something happens, the people will be soldiers, achieving the goal that if the government cannot protect Shanghai, the people can protect Shanghai, so that we can be worthy of the people, worthy of ourselves, and worthy of our ancestors.</p>
<h3>Representative Speeches</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association representative Lu Jingshi gave a speech saying that the Japanese army is invading the Northeast, and the Northeast has 400,000 troops, but they are not resisting. We must know that China is the China of the Chinese people, so there is an urgent need for the launch of a people's volunteer army. It is quite commendable that the Volunteer Army of the whole city has achieved this today. If we add training, how can we not be able to be as one against ten? We will definitely be able to defend Shanghai and fight the Japanese invaders. The representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wu Zhihao, said in his speech that the Japanese army is invading Liaodong with 100,000 troops, but China's more than 2 million troops cannot resist, which is very sad. Today, it is indeed very necessary for our people to organize a volunteer army to be the government's backing. He believes that it will definitely be able to make China a completely independent country. Finally, Wu Mai of the National Lawyers Association, Wang Hanliang of the Citizens' Union, Cao Zhigong of the National Products Factory Federation, and Zhou Xuexiang, a representative of the industrial sector, successively gave speeches, and Yu Hualong of the presidium gave a response (the speech is omitted).</p>

<h3>Telegraph to Compatriots Across the Country</h3>
<p>All newspaper offices forwarded a public message to compatriots across the country. For twenty years, the country has been plagued by turmoil due to different political views, plunging the country into a fragmented situation. Our people are in deep water and great fire, which has led to repeated foreign insults. The Japanese imperialists have recently intensified their efforts, massacring our compatriots and forcibly occupying our Eastern Province. The country is filled with anger and the survival of the nation is at stake. Fortunately, the comrades from all parties still have a heart and are willing to donate their private views to share the national crisis. Therefore, the dawn of peaceful unification has appeared. This is what our people have been praying for day and night. Now that the formal meeting is about to open, rumors are spreading, which will hinder the progress of peaceful unification. All compatriots, please fulfill your responsibilities as citizens of the Republic, rise up and appeal for strict correction, and urge representatives from both sides to formally hold a meeting as soon as possible. If they delay any longer, the disaster will bite at the navel. Those who sabotage the peace and unification conference and hinder the progress of the peace and unification conference are all criminals of the country and public enemies of our people. I hope that my compatriots will carefully consider the situation. I am looking forward to receiving a telegram and cannot wait to hear from you.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Municipal Administration Meeting</h3>
<p>The 193rd Session</p>
<p>The Municipal Government held the 193rd Municipal Administration Meeting on October 9, 20th year of the Republic. Attendees included Sun Baorong, Zhou Liangcai, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Xizeng, Cai Zengji, Shen Yi, Xu Peiying, Hu Hongji, Zhu Yan, and Huang Boqiao. Observers included Yu Hongjun. The meeting was chaired by Mayor and recorded by Zhu Weiyao (acting). (A) Reports: Chairman's Report: (1) Current situation; (2) The disaster situation in various places is extremely serious.

<h3>Navigation Public Bonds Will Be Issued</h3>
<p>The Guarantee Fund Has Reached Perfection</p>
<p>The Principal and Interest Amendment Regulations Are Being Drafted</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance had previously approved the 10 million yuan Navigation Public Bonds that had been approved by the Executive Yuan. However, the issuance of the bonds was delayed because the allocation of the bonds' use was not perfect and because of the stable guarantee fund. Since the Japanese bandits invaded the Northeast, the people of the country have risen up to resist Japan, and economic severance and trade in national goods have changed to be loaded on Chinese ships for transportation and sales, causing Japanese shipping companies in China to have successively suspended operations. However, Chinese shipping companies lack capital and have very few ships, and the national shipping routes have not been completed. There is a shortage of ships for a large amount of goods, resulting in a lack of turnaround. Therefore, the Shanghai Shipping Association has sent telegrams to the Ministry of Communications urging the rapid issuance of the previously approved Navigation Public Bonds to add ships and expand shipping routes in order to save shipping rights. The Ministry immediately forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting an early approval so as not to miss this good opportunity to develop the domestic shipping industry. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance believes that Chinese ships have been squeezed out by Japanese ships over the years, resulting in the gradual decline of the shipping industry. At a time when the promotion of industry is valued, any national commerce depends on the government's development. It is necessary to issue the Navigation Public Bonds. It is also understood that the Ministry is re-consulting the guarantee fund method to achieve perfection, and the regulations on repayment of principal and payment of interest are also being drafted by the Public Bond Division. It is expected that it will be issued in the near future.</p>

<h3>Brothers Shot Together</h3>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang is in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Zhang Yuxiang Has Died Tragically</p>
<p>The late local resident Zhang, who started his career as a racecourse tout, lived at 112 Huayuan Stone Bridge Road in Pudong and had considerable assets. He married three wives, Bao, Qiao, and Zhang, in succession. The first and second wives did not have children. The first wife adopted a son as an infant named Guoxiang, who is now 30 years old. The third wife, Zhang, gave birth to three sons: the eldest, Yuxiang, is 23 years old, the second, Qingxiang, is 21 years old, and the youngest, Yunxiang, is 16 years old. After Zhang's death, the first wife fell ill in June of this year (lunar calendar) and will be holding a funeral on the 100th day of her death, which is the fifth day of the next month. Guoxiang moved to Zhao Zhangsheng's house in Lane 35 behind the residence after getting married and currently works as a secretary at Yangjing Middle School in Pudong. He usually sleeps at the school. Yesterday was Sunday, so he was at home. His brother Yuxiang was also visiting. At around 7:00 PM last night, several thugs suddenly broke in with pistols and fired randomly at Guoxiang and Yuxiang, firing about seven or eight shots. Guoxiang was hit in the right neck by a bullet that did not exit. Yuxiang was shot in the right cheek and the back of the head, neither of which penetrated. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled. Guoxiang was still able to shout after being shot and immediately hired a rickshaw to go to Pudong Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was transferred to Baolong Hospital in Puxi. Yuxiang had already fallen to the ground in a pool of blood, on the verge of death. His sister-in-law and wife, Bao, ordered people to carry him to Pudong Hospital. The hospital said that the injuries were extremely severe and that his life was in danger, so they gave him five doses of adrenaline and immediately ordered him to be taken to Renji Hospital in Puxi for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died shortly after. After the incident, the squad leader of the Third District Police Station dispatched police officers to search for the murderers, but they could not be found. Guoxiang is 30 years old, has been married for many years, and has two daughters, one seven years old and the other four years old. He has worked as a racecourse tout for Taikoo Company and a ticket seller for public buses. He has also been a staff member of the Nanyang Tobacco Company's former Pudong branch, an accountant for the Youting Industrial Society, and an executive officer in the organization department of the Fifth District Party Headquarters. He is currently the secretary of Yangjing Middle School. Yuxiang is 23 years old, married Bao two years ago, and has no children. He used to work at the British-American Tobacco Company factory and is now a racecourse tout for Taikoo Company. Passersby speculated about the double assassination, but no one could agree on the reason. The reason for the incident is still unknown.</p>

<h3>Kidnapper Han Yuecheng</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Fifteen Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Kidnapper Han Yuecheng, 37 years old, from Funing, resides at 4 Peikai'er Road in Shanghai. In late July of last year, he colluded with six water police officers from the 17th team of the Fourth District, including Chen Guoliang, Wang Youcai, and Zhang Peisong, to kidnap Wang Buyun, a wealthy merchant from Ruifeng Sandbank in Wusong, along with his son and Ji Laiyuan. They were taken to a boat, which was then sailed to Shitou Sandbank, where landlords Shi Shangzhi, Gong Hongfu, and Gu Xuewen were also kidnapped. They were taken to Chensha, Yancheng, Xinyangkou, Funing Yanghe, and other places in Tongzhou and hid on the sea, coercing the hostages to write letters demanding ransom, asking for tens of thousands of yuan. It has been more than a year. Now, except for hostage Shi Shangzhi, who died of illness in the bandit's den and whose body was thrown into the sea by the bandits, all the others have taken the opportunity to escape from the bandit ship one after another. The perpetrators had been wanted for a long time and had not been apprehended until July of this year, when the Wusong Water Police Fourth District purchased a lead and apprehended Han Yuecheng. He was sent to the Baoshan County Government for repeated interrogation, and Wang Buyun, Gong Hongfu, Gu Xuewen, and Ji Laiyuan were summoned to court to identify him as one of the kidnappers on the boat. Yesterday, Judge Shi Cheng heard the case and sentenced Han Yuecheng for the crime of kidnapping and extortion. However, after investigating the fact that the perpetrator was compelled by hunger and cold, the circumstances were excusable, so he was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment.</p>

<h3>The Director of the Taicang Slaughterhouse Embezzles Public Funds and Flees to Shanghai, Where He is Detained</h3>
<p>Yang Gang (also known as Ti Jian), the director of the Taicang County Government Slaughterhouse, a native of Haimen, has recently been accused of embezzling 2,545 yuan in slaughter taxes and forging documents. He has absconded and cannot be found. The Taicang County Government has requested the local public security bureau to investigate. At around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, Ren Songlin, a detective team member from the Taicang Public Food Security Bureau, and Qin Daizhou, Yang's guarantor, came to Shanghai to secretly investigate. When they learned that Yang was inside a certain law firm at 570 Baik Road in the Public Concession, they reported to the Xinzha Police Station to request assistance. The chief officer said that Ren had no official document and ordered him to first go to the First Special Court to request an arrest warrant. Ren went directly to the Special Court while secretly monitoring Yang's guarantor Qin Daizhou. Before Ren could obtain the arrest warrant, Yang was about to leave Baik Road and was arrested by Hua Pu No. 30003 after Qin cried out, and was taken to the police station. The next morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. Detective Ren and Chen Bingda, a political police officer from Taicang County, submitted a case report, stating the facts of the case and claiming that the official document would be delivered this afternoon, requesting a temporary postponement. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the police station, also agreed. The defendant Yang Gang was questioned and denied the charges, saying that Yang had a lawsuit with the Taicang County Chief and the Director of the Education Bureau due to the issue of funds, and is currently appealing to the High Court. Therefore, the Taicang County Chief and the defendant are on opposing sides. How can the defendant be arrested? Therefore, he objected to the transfer. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered Yang to be detained until the Taicang County government document arrives next Tuesday for further verification.</p>

<p>Asking for Money Leads to Arguments</p>
<p>Police Hear About It and Take Her to the Authorities</p>
<p>A Changzhou girl, Miss Li, is nearing the age of marriage but is ugly and pockmarked. She was walking on the road in the northern part of the city the day before yesterday when she was lured to an inn by a man whose name is unknown, who raped her.

<h3>Woman Actor Accuses Horse Trader of Seduction</h3>
<p>Wang Caiyun (real name Shi Wang), a 21-year-old female actor from the Beijing Opera troupe at the Sun Sun Amusement Park, originally from Taixian County and residing at No. 11 Wuzhen Road, Zhabei, was allegedly seduced and violated in February of last year by a horse trader from Qingjiang named Shi Qingrong. They reportedly rented a house and lived together. When Wang's mother learned of this, she hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Shi Qingrong of seducing her daughter. However, at that time, Wang Caiyun was deeply in love with Shi Qingrong, leading to the mother's loss in the trial. Now, the love between Wang and Shi has deteriorated, leading to a lawsuit initiated independently by Wang Caiyun, accusing Shi of using fraudulent means to seduce her. The complaint stated that the plaintiff had been studying opera with her mother since childhood and working at Sun Sun Amusement Park. The horse trader Shi Qingrong, relying on his wealth, repeatedly seduced her, taking advantage of her youth and inexperience. He claimed to be unmarried and expressed his desire to live and die together as husband and wife. In February of last year, she believed him and engaged in sexual relations as if they were married. Later, her mother discovered this and rebuked her. However, blinded by love, on July 20th of last year, she secretly ran away to live with Shi at No. 11 Wuzhen Road, engaging in marital relations. She repeatedly urged him to hold a wedding ceremony, but Shi kept delaying. In March of this year, she learned that Shi was already married with children. Angered and wanting to die, she confronted him, but he avoided her. She had been deceived and seduced, and unexpectedly, Shi Qingrong, knowing all the details, stopped living with her and neglected her needs for months. His actions of seduction followed by abandonment constitute a crime against public morals under Article 244 of the criminal law. Therefore, she requested that the court prosecute him according to the law. The Special Court accepted the complaint and ordered a summons. In the afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiebin presided over the criminal court and summoned the defendant, Shi Qingrong. Shi did not appear but sent lawyer Liu Hui縏 to the court, stating that the defendant was working at the racecourse and could not attend due to the Shanghai races. The plaintiff, along with her lawyer Liu Mingdu, also appeared in court to explain the case. They did not object to the postponement. Judge Xiao adjourned the case for another hearing.</p>

The next day, the Huishan Patrol found the truck number and learned that it belonged to Desheng Wenji Trucking Company. They dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Wan and bring him to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the criminal court for examination. The patrol lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, described the case, stating that it was difficult to investigate the name, age, and address of the deceased. Constable 1225 had inquired about the deceased's name and age, and the deceased claimed to live behind Songchun Sauce Garden on Taopeng Road, but no such person was found. The lawyers were unsure of the deceased's family. Witnesses Xu Fubei, Jiang Waizhong, and Xu Caisheng testified that they saw the deceased walking on the south side of Taopeng Road when he was knocked down by the front wheel of the truck and run over by the rear wheel, which then sped away without stopping. The defendant claimed that he was driving from Beijing Road, carrying yellow mud to Huasheng Road to unload the cargo. The deceased begged laborers Cai Er, Cai San, Liu Wu, and Liu Liu to ride along to Taopeng Road. The deceased suddenly jumped off the vehicle; the defendant was unaware of it. Later, the laborers told him that someone who hitched a ride jumped off the vehicle and might have fallen. He immediately went to investigate and learned that the man was already dead. The defendant said he was about to turn himself in when he was arrested. Judge Shen examined the evidence and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for a new trial at a later date.</p>

Subsequently, Liu Jichen proposed that the official meeting for peaceful reunification has been delayed, and the national crisis is urgent and cannot be tolerated. A joint telegram was drafted on the current situation, as follows: To all newspaper offices across the country and to compatriots at home and abroad: Since the violent Japanese invasion of our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, the people of the country, aware that national subjugation is imminent, have cried out and appealed to the Ning-Yue authorities for peace. We sincerely hope that the leaders of both sides will come to Shanghai to jointly plan for the national crisis. We are extremely grateful and welcome. However, the survival of the party and the country depends on whether this peaceful unification conference can be realized. We must strive for both sides to sacrifice their prejudices and unite sincerely to open a formal conference, establish a unified government according to the principles of the National Construction Program, eliminate all disputes, determine the foundation of political tutelage, complete the revolutionary enterprise, implement the Three Principles of the People, and promote the true spirit of democracy. This will not only satisfy the trust of the people of the country but also comfort the spirit of the late Premier Sun in heaven. The members of this association, as members of the nation, have a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country, and how can we remain silent? If anyone fights for personal rights and disrupts peaceful unification, willingly becoming a slave of national subjugation, using compatriots as a last resort, then they will be the public enemy of the people, no different from Zhang Bangchang and Li Wanyong, the second group of national traitors. All Chinese are allowed to punish them. Not only will national history not forgive them, but also. Now, to avenge external humiliation and recover territory, we must vigorously promote peaceful reunification internally, achieve it as soon as possible, clear the thorns and thistles ahead, and determine national plans early to preserve our more than five thousand years of solemn and glorious territory. It is hoped that compatriots at home and abroad will unanimously advocate for it.</p>
<h3>Wang Renlin Discusses the Latest Unemployment Problems in Various Countries</h3>
<p>According to the National Society, the economic downturn and unemployment problems in various countries around the world have been on the rise recently. A reporter from the National Society interviewed Mr. Wang Renlin, the director of the Chinese branch of the International Labour Office, about the unemployment problems in various countries in the Yuyuan Road. According to the discussion, since the winter of 1929, the world has experienced an unprecedented economic crisis, the productivity of various countries has been sluggish, and purchasing power has been exhausted. As a result, many industries and businesses have closed down, and the unemployment problem has become increasingly serious. In July and August, the International Labour Office received reports from various countries that the number of unemployed people has increased without decreasing, and the future is not optimistic. If the global economic situation does not improve significantly in the near future, then the unemployed will suffer greatly this winter, and social unrest will occur. The number of unemployed people in each country is listed below. However, this number cannot be used for international comparison of unemployed persons because the sources on which reports from different countries are based are different. Some are based on the number of people receiving benefits, some are based on the number of people who have registered as unemployed, and others are based on other sources. The table below lists the number of unemployed people in the current year and the same day last year to show a comparison.</p>
<p>Country Name Report According to July-August This Year Number of Unemployed Last Year Same Month Number of Unemployed</p>

<p>United States Labor Union 18,009 15,007</p>
<p>The number of unemployed people is so large and has increased compared to last year, which shows the severity of the situation. In June of this year, the International Labour Conference held its 15th session, which not only discussed this issue in detail but also passed a resolution. The European Federal Inquiry Committee and the 12th International League of Nations also conducted a detailed investigation and passed a resolution on this issue. The 55th session of the International Labour Office's Board of Directors, which is currently being held, is also preparing to conduct a detailed study. The Director of the International Labour Office, Mr. Thomas, paid close attention to the unemployment issue, and the first part of the report submitted to the 15th International Labour Conference was a specialized study of this issue, making the following recommendations to help solve the unemployment problem: (1) Establish public employment agencies (2) Colonize undeveloped areas for cultivation (3) Create an unemployment insurance system (4) Organize domestic and international public works</p>

<h3>Second Special Court Subsidizes Tongren Fuyuan Hall Expenses</h3>
<p>The Tongren Fuyuan Hall branch has been providing charitable services in the French Concession for seventy years. Since the Republic of China, the French Concession Mixed Court has been donating 60 yuan per month, which is on record. Since the government took back the court and established the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court in August of this year, the branch immediately sent a letter requesting that the court director continue to allocate funds as before. The Second Court submitted a request to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, which was forwarded to the Administrative Department of the Court for approval. The court informed the hall that it would send someone to collect the 120 yuan for August and September and that the subsidy would be issued at the end of each month starting in October. The directors of the hall, Qin Yanwa and Zhu Cishi, believe that the court director paid attention to local charities and allocated funds to help them as soon as he took office, which is a sign of legal and political progress.</p>

<h3>Declaration by the Staff of the Shishi Xinbao Editorial Department</h3>
<p>Nine-tenths of the Departures are Due to Dismissals</p>
<p>Details Given with a Request for Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shishi Xinbao has recently laid off as many as nineteen editorial staff members due to financial difficulties. In addition, seven people resigned voluntarily, accounting for nine-tenths of the entire editorial staff. The staff association of the newspaper's editorial department issued a declaration yesterday, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Public of All Circles: The undersigned have served in the editorial department of the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao for many years, diligently and conscientiously fulfilling our duties. The Shishi Xinbao owes its present state in part to the efforts of the undersigned. Unexpectedly, on October 29th, the management, citing financial difficulties, dismissed seven staff members who had served for more than ten years, namely Zhou Xiao'an, Cao Shoucheng, Zhan Tianwei, Huang Jiamo, Li Qiulin, Zhou Fuming, and Zhang Jingfu. Upon hearing this news, we were shocked and dismayed. After investigation, we found that the newspaper's operating income could still be maintained with effort. It is impossible to use the business situation of one or two months as the standard for the entire profit and loss. Moreover, recently, the newspaper has been increasing capital, expanding its business, and adding many new staff members, with salaries as high as two or three hundred yuan, which is many times higher than those of the old staff. Therefore, the management's layoffs are definitely not due to financial difficulties; there is no doubt that this action has other purposes and is intended to deliberately destroy the company. This is simply unacceptable in terms of reason and law. The undersigned witnessed this and were deeply saddened and indignant. We unanimously advocated organizing an editorial staff association. While maintaining order, we held a meeting and resolved to request the management to withdraw its decision. However, the management firmly refused to recognize the organization of the staff association and did not accept the demands of the staff association. The undersigned also made concessions and did not insist on the original proposal. After a public resolution, we requested that the dismissed staff be given three to six months of severance pay and that reasonable protection be given to those who had not been dismissed. A letter was sent to the management requesting an immediate reply. How should the management understand our plight and give us appropriate consideration? However, the management refused to accept it and instead dismissed twelve people, namely Jiang Xiangqing, Zhang Mengxiong, Hu Xiru, Xu Shaoqin, Wu Futong, Pan Tianbo, Hu Tisheng, Jiang Huaiqing, Zhang Tingkui, Ji Zhaozheng, He Ziheng, and He Xiya, without any reason. In total, the number of people dismissed in the two instances accounted for as much as eight-tenths of the entire editorial department. On the 31st, a large number of detectives were hired to guard the editorial department and prohibit staff from entering or leaving. The situation was tense, as if facing a formidable enemy. The few remaining staff members were coerced into signing statements and forced to withdraw from the staff association. As a result, seven more people resigned voluntarily out of anger: Yuan Xifan, Chen Xiliang, Xu Langting, Huang Tianpeng, Chen Yuanliang, Li Zhuozhen, Wu Qiannan, etc. Under this violent oppression by capitalists, we are unable to resist them. Newspapers are organs of public opinion. For more than ten years, we have adhered to our ideals, and our aspirations can be summarized in two points: (1) Based on the spirit of serving society and advocating the stance of the Party and the nation, we are all determined to devote ourselves to the newspaper industry for life. We have always shown fervent sympathy and support for social undertakings and have done our best to promote them. (2) Because we have a long history with this newspaper and have devoted special labor, blood, sweat, and energy to it, we cherish it deeply and regard it as our second life. We are constantly worried and diligent, working hard from morning till night. Our greatest goal is to see the newspaper's position rise day by day and its business develop and prosper. Unexpectedly, recently, the authorities' measures have been misguided and have become increasingly distant from the aspirations of the undersigned. In the morning, they abruptly dismissed all the colleagues who have shared weal and woe for more than ten years without any reason. Such wanton destruction is truly heartbreaking. At this critical moment when the sun of aggression is invading China, newspapers are powerful tools for propaganda and should be used to serve the country in order to awaken compatriots and jointly meet the national crisis. However, the management does not plan to do this and instead dismisses a large number of staff members without any reason, placing those who have devoted themselves to writing at a dead end. No one with a conscience would do this. For the sake of our own interests and the sacred cause of the newspaper, we hereby issue this declaration to seek the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of society. Jiang Xiangqing, Ji Zhaozheng, Chen Xiliang, Chen Yuanliang, Wu Qiannan, Hu Tisheng, Li Zhuozhen, Huang Feipeng, He Ziheng, Yuan Xifan, Xu Langting, Xu Shaoqin, Li Qiulin, Wu Futong, Pan Tianbo, Jiang Huaiqing, Zhang Mengxiong, He Xiya, Zhang Tingkui, Zhou Xiao'an, Cao Taocheng, Hu Xiru, Zhou Fuming, et al.</p>

It was resolved that the association should send a letter to the Stamp Tax Sales Office and Office to explain that since they had broken the agreement, we would have to affix stamps according to the regulations. However, we requested that they be exempt from investigation before November 5th and that we could comply after November 5th. All members were notified that all notices issued after November 5th should have a one-cent stamp affixed. (2) For businesses in the concession, since they have already paid the license tax, it would be difficult to bear if they had to pay the business tax again. It was resolved that the standing committee members of the association should continue to fight for this with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Business Tax Office. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Umbrella Industry: The Umbrella Industry Association convened a general meeting of member representatives on the afternoon of the 28th of last month to establish the association.

<p>Paint and Woodware Industry: The Paint and Woodware Industry Association convened an executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday at the office on Zhejiang Road. More than 20 people attended. Du Yongsheng, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting and proposed the Shi Chengzhang case. After discussion, it was decided to wait and see what actions he took before discussing it further. Then, it was proposed to advise the members of each gang to prohibit the purchase of Japanese goods. It was publicly decided that if Japanese goods were found after sending personnel to investigate, they would be sealed. Then, it was proposed that the first batch of business tax reporting forms had been forwarded to the Chamber of Commerce. Those who had not yet filled out the forms in accordance with the regulations should be urged to do so as soon as possible in order to comply with the procedures and pay heavy taxes. The meeting was adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Restaurant Industry: The Restaurant Industry Association established a Japanese Goods Inspection Team on the 22nd of last month and elected inspection committee members Zhang Shaoping, Shao Yuerun, Shao Zaihang, etc., to be filed with the National Salvation Association and dispatched on the 28th to inspect the remaining Japanese goods and dishes sold by members and non-members of the industry. The Restaurant Association presented a letter to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the Rongshun Restaurant, located at the southern end of Beixianghua Bridge inside the New North Gate of this city, and the Zhongjuxing Restaurant and Qiaji Restaurant in Dongqiujiang Road, Zhabei, claim that they are preparing to organize a Restaurant Industry Association and have applied to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for filing and have been approved. According to Article 5 of the Law of Industrial and Commercial Associations, only one association is allowed to be established in the same industry within the same region. The preparation and organization of the Restaurant Industry Association is obviously illegal. The current association was first reorganized and established on July 20, 1930, and was filed. The organization of the association includes not only lunch boxes but also those who run restaurants. Now, the association is hindering the handling of business taxes, etc., which is very difficult. On the 17th of this month, the Shanghai Party Department was requested to stop the preparation of the Restaurant Industry Association. On the 24th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department Executive Committee issued a batch No. 552, stating that the case had been reported and that the Restaurant Industry Association had been reported by Zhou Xingyuan, etc., and had long been rejected by the association and ordered to be merged into the association. This batch was based on the fact that the Rongshun Restaurant mixed up the batch of Jun Bureau. Since it was not approved by the Municipal Party Department, it was arbitrarily claimed that it was approved by Jun Bureau, which was obviously a false statement to confuse people. The procedure of deliberate disruption has confused the hearing and land, and it is necessary to submit it to the Jun Bureau for review and approval to clearly prohibit the illegal organization of the Restaurant Industry Association and order all of them to join the association in order to unify and comply with the law. Please start. (The following is omitted)</p>

<p>(Advocating that merchants who privately sell Japanese goods should be sentenced to death)</p>
<p>(Reply) Whether the foundation of a country is strong depends on the spirit of the rule of law. The enactment and execution of laws must go through the organs and procedures prescribed by the constitution agreed upon by the people. If everyone can legislate, the country will be in great chaos. We will do our best to promote the boycott of Japanese goods and are truly disgusted with those who privately sell Japanese goods. However, if we sentence them to death, it will not be what we want in our hearts or what the law allows. We can only use more effective propaganda and persuasion. Think about how Gandhi advocated not using British goods, and we have never heard of punishing Indians who privately use British goods, but it has been so effective.</p>

<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: The newspaper reported the day before yesterday that the three district party departments of the third, fourth, and seventh districts jointly issued an electric report, which was originally approved by the district party department of this district because Luo Changmin, an alternate supervisory committee member of this district, did not know the situation in advance and stated to your newspaper yesterday that there was no such electric report issued, etc. This was actually a misunderstanding at the time. Please check and correct it. Sincerely, Executive Committee of the Fourth District Party Department, Shenbao News Agency, November 1, 1931</p>

<p>The Voice of Anti-Japanese Resistance</p>
<p>— Xuechang</p>
<p>We do not dare to casually advocate a decisive battle against the brutal Japan that has forcibly occupied our Eastern Provinces. It is because the Japanese are brutal, unreasonable, and reckless in their ambition to trample on our land, kill our officials and people, and loot our property, and they will endanger the survival of our country. Therefore, we cannot but take up arms to deal with them. The people of our country have long cultivated a sense of hatred for the Japanese through the observation of their tyranny. Today, even women and children regard the Japanese as enemies. If we submit to the enemy again, the national self-esteem of the people will inevitably be destroyed. If the national self-esteem of the people is destroyed, the country can be destroyed immediately. Now that the powerful neighbor is pressing the border, it is time for our people to temper themselves. We hope that our compatriots will rise up to resist and not invite the disaster of national subjugation by retreating.</p>

<h3>Long Busy Play Forget Complete</h3>
<p>So many Longs: Minister, President, Dean, Chairman, Director, Principal, Bank President, Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Committee - one person is all "Longs."</p>
<p>With so many "Longs," naturally they are busy: busy meeting guests, busy giving speeches, busy reading letters, busy signing documents, busy answering the phone, busy riding in the car, busy attending banquets, busy opening and adjourning meetings, busy with things they shouldn't be doing and busy even when there's nothing to do.</p>
<p>Busy all day long. When they're busy, they must play: playing cards, playing mahjong, playing with prostitutes, playing in dance halls, playing in West Lake, playing on Mount Lu, playing in Shanghai...</p>
<p>So fun, so fun, they forget everything. They forget the Party, they forget the country, they forget the people, they forget their own future, and they even forget the nine characters that they shouldn't forget (Note).</p>
<p>Everything is coming to an end soon. The Party is coming to an end soon, the country is coming to an end soon, the people are coming to an end soon, and they themselves are coming to an end soon. Yet, they are still endlessly busy, hoping that their time as "Long" will never end and that their playing will never end.</p>
<p>(Small Note) Wu Zhihui said, "If you don't do a good job, I'll replace you." But coming and not doing is forgetting the nine.</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of Boycotting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>Since the Opium War during the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, after China lost the war and paid compensation to Britain, the powers' conspiracy to invade was revealed, but China was unwilling to show weakness to Japan. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce was signed during the Tongzhi reign, but its rights were not the same as those enjoyed by other countries. After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, Japan made many demands, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki caused even greater losses. The major ones include tax-free imports of shoddy goods that flooded the Chinese market, and the freedom to set up factories in treaty ports, but the yarn factories were biased towards the interior. Over the past 40 years, their power has grown, and their ambition for economic aggression has become increasingly apparent. Therefore, the hatred of the Chinese people towards the brutal Japan is greater than that of European and American countries. After many negotiations, the government could not use strength as the backing of justice, so it had to boycott Japanese goods to fight against them. According to its past, there were about nine times. The first time was the case of the Chen Wan privately transporting military equipment in the 34th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. The second time was the case of the Japanese forcibly demanding the Anfeng Road rights in the first year of Xuantong in the Qing Dynasty. The third time was the Twenty-One Demands in the fourth year of the Republic of China. The fourth time was the issue of recovering Qingdao in the eighth year of the Republic of China. The fifth time was the issue of recovering Lushun and Dalian in the ninth year of the Republic of China. The sixth time was the May Thirtieth Incident in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China. The seventh time was the Jinan Massacre in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. The eighth time was the issue of Manchuria and Mongolia in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. The ninth time was the Wanbaoshan Incident this year. Whenever there is a problem with Japan, the people always use boycotting Japanese goods as the government's assistance. Their spirit of慷慨激昂嚴厲檢舉 is enough to express the national spirit of China. Gu Yi turns around in an instant and puts it behind his head, so the ridicule of five minutes of heat has its origin. In the past month, there have been ten boycotts of Japanese goods due to the brutal Japanese invasion of the Eastern Provinces. Boycotting Japanese goods is the fundamental strategy of economic severance, which is enough to kill the Japanese. If the spirit of unity does not slacken, how can it be difficult to make shoddy goods disappear from China? Only the tiger's head and snake's tail have a beginning and no end, suddenly the blood is boiling and suddenly it is as cold as ice. This is why the nine boycotts of Japanese goods in the past have failed to achieve results. Now, the organization of anti-Japanese groups, the strict inspection and sealing, and the concerted efforts of the people must be good. I hope that the people of the country will learn from the past and not privately enter or purchase. May the great work not return to nothing. I have described the past to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Radio Detective Work</h3>
<p>— By Yisheng</p>
<p>Since Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective novels became popular, the name Scotland Yard has become known worldwide. Although Conan Doyle's Scotland Yard is a fictional creation, inevitably embellished, the real Scotland Yard is indeed very alert and agile. Compared to what Conan Doyle described, the activities of Scotland Yard today cannot be considered an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard is located in two large gray six-story buildings on the banks of the River Thames in London. The central hub for what is known as "radio crime fighting" is located here. Day and night, people are constantly on duty, and all crime reports and pursuit commands are issued from this agency. Once a crime occurs, a report is received within a few minutes, and orders for alert and arrest are immediately issued, with motorcycle police deployed throughout the city by radio. Because London's robbers often use cars to escape after robberies, these motorcycle police leave them with no chance of escape. In the past eight months, they have solved 400 cases, nearly solving every crime. From last Christmas until now, the total sentence length for highway robbers caught is said to be 250 years.</p>
<p>Police detective work is precise, and thieves' self-defense methods are also clever. A few months ago, police detected that some thieves were also using radios to intercept radio transmissions from Scotland Yard. Therefore, Scotland Yard now constantly changes the length of its radio waves, making it difficult for thieves to track.</p>
<p>Since last March, stolen goods recovered and returned to their owners have been worth as much as 250,000 gold dollars. These stolen goods include whiskey, silverware, valuable furs, and even cigarettes.</p>
<p>The radio room is soundproof, so although trams rumble by the River Thames outside all day, the room is not affected at all. The floor, ceiling, and walls of this room are inlaid with metal. All messages come from the highest skies above London.</p>
<p>Outside this metal driver's room are several other rooms where the radio mechanical engineers of the station spend all day designing, manufacturing, and repairing equipment. They are now planning to manufacture small, lightweight, portable radio telephone receivers to be installed on motorcycle police vehicles.</p>
<h3>A Record of Qingdao Forts</h3>
<p>— Jin Junren</p>
<p>Qingdao is a famous summer resort in China, and its forts are among Qingdao's famous scenic spots. It can be said with certainty that anyone visiting Qingdao must visit the forts.</p>
<p>The Qingdao forts were built by the Germans. There were four of them. After the German defeat in World War I, they have become desolate, like bronze camels covered in thorns, only serving as a reminder of the past. It is said that when the German army withdrew after defeat, they destroyed many of them to prevent them from benefiting the enemy. I visited Fort No. 1 in June. Two guides opened the gate and led me inside. It was gloomy and cold, making people uncomfortable. The guides lit two white candles to illuminate the way. In each room we passed, they would tell visitors the function of the room. The ground was damp and cold, as if haunted by ghosts, and the flickering light made people feel even more frightened. According to the guides, one room was occupied by the Red Cross during the Sino-German War. The whitewashed walls were stained with countless human bloodstains, flowing from the bodies of Prussian soldiers. In another room were two wooden barrels, as tall as a person. One was empty, and the other still contained a deep blue liquid. The guides said that this was the kitchen of the Prussian soldiers, and the liquid in the barrel was butter that they ate during the war.</p>
<p>Fort No. 1 was equipped with four large cannons. I entered through the smallest cannon emplacement and exited through the largest. After exiting, I saw the sky, with trees providing shade and the sea calm. The quiet and beautiful scenery was enough to make people linger.</p>
<p>Short News: Novelist Yan Fusun has invented a gourd-based character divination, using artistic techniques to analyze the structure of characters and verify human affairs with uncanny accuracy. His studio has now moved to No. 1 Lixian Lane, Avenue Dubail, French Concession. Gourd character divination has already started, with a fee of two yuan and twenty cents. Correspondence from outside Shanghai will be charged double. Mr. Yan has been ill for a long time and is now accepting orders again. All accumulated orders will be cleared within one month. Furthermore, Mr. Yan has recently responded to requests from all walks of life and is recruiting thirty remote disciples to study Chinese classics. Those who register can choose to study essays, novels, couplets, correspondence, calligraphy, astrology, and other miscellaneous writings at any time, and ask questions without limit. Detailed answers will be provided by mail. In addition, literary works, whether prose or poetry, can also be revised on his behalf. Anyone who likes to study literature, whether from Shanghai or elsewhere, regardless of gender or age, can register. There is only a one-time fee of twenty yuan. It is said that there are still places available, and registration will be closed when the quota is full.</p>
<h3>Lüsi Fishermen</h3>
<p>— Yin Shouman</p>
<p>Lüsi district of Nantong is located near the coast, and most of its residents make a living by fishing. They spend the whole year sailing boats and casting nets, braving the stormy waves. Their lives are very hard. Between March and April, it is usually the fishing season, and there are more fishermen, because the amount of their catch at this time has a huge impact on their livelihood for the whole year. In recent years, due to the decline of the nation, maritime fishing rights have been seized by Japan. Moreover, our fishing boats are very simple, and they cannot compete with their well-equipped fishing boats. As a result, the livelihood of our fishermen has been severely eroded. The fishermen of Lüsi, aware of this, agreed to unite and resist. One day, a Japanese fishing boat invaded the sea off Lüsi, fishing back and forth and catching a lot. It was preparing to return fully loaded when suddenly cries were heard everywhere, and fishing boats gathered like clouds. Some used earthen cannons, and others used hunting rifles to attack the Japanese boat fiercely. The Japanese boat also fought back, but eventually it was outnumbered and had to flee. In its haste, it mistakenly ran aground. The fishermen swarmed up, seized its weapons, took its fish, and tattooed the words "fish thief" on the faces of the Japanese with coal ash and oil to make the words last a long time before letting them go. From then on, Japanese fishing boats in the sea off Lüsi warned each other not to invade again.</p>

<h3>A Country Bumpkin in Shanghai Again (4)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The man in the gray clothes had just walked next to the country bumpkin when he saw someone walk up and greet him. That person had a snow-white face and crimson lips, but there was a small mustache just below his nose, about an inch or less than eight tenths in length. He thought... this must be a barber who had carelessly shaved off the hair on his left side, so he also trimmed the mustache on his right side, making it this way. He also thought... city people really take good care of themselves. If country people like us grow mustaches, they all have yellow faces and skinny bodies. If he didn't have that mustache, I would have thought he was a young man in his early twenties.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin saw that the fair-faced man with the mustache was wearing a white linen long gown with a black gauze vest over it. He was puzzled again. City people are really not afraid of the heat. They still wear vests over their linen gowns. People like us only wear a single short shirt and still sweat all over.</p>
<p>"Are you also here to welcome Commissioner Wang?" The country bumpkin heard a lisping accent (Note 4).</p>
<p>"Yes, they telegraphed saying he would be on this train," replied the fair-faced man with the mustache to the man in gray clothes.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin was secretly puzzled, thinking, is one commissioner worth so many people welcoming him? I heard a trustee of our village say... a commissioner is a very small official, even smaller than the county magistrate. The night watchmen, city gate officials, and money-escorting officials of the past were all commissioners. When it comes to collecting rent, those of us country people who couldn't afford to pay the rent and were dragged into the city to be beaten on the buttocks were called rent-collecting commissioners. I heard that those kinds of commissioners still had to kowtow to their superiors to get the job. They dragged the tenants over, didn't ask any questions, and specialized in beating the buttocks of those stubborn old rent-eating people. Sometimes they even had to resist him and tease him, shouting loudly when they were beaten on the buttocks... "The magistrate is killing us!" "The magistrate is killing us!"</p>
<p>"But I don't owe rent and I'm not afraid of any commissioner," the country bumpkin felt very clear in his conscience, but he was keeping in line with the principle of Confucius, who advocated inquiry about doubts and questions, and so he wanted to ask what kind of commissioner they were welcoming that was worthy of such seriousness.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir... what kind of commissioner are you welcoming?" The country bumpkin couldn't help but ask the fair-faced man with the mustache.</p>
<p>The fair-faced man glanced at him, snorted in his nose, and said...</p>
<p>"What commissioner? Isn't it a Central Commissioner?"</p>
<p>"Haha, a 'central' commissioner, and it's the weather in July! Are city people only interested in eating and completely ignorant of farming?"</p>
<p>(Note 4) Country people call those who speak Mandarin with a lisp a "bent tongue."</p>
<h3>Talking About Poison Gas and How to Prevent It (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yubo</p>
<p>Regarding methods of prevention, I have heard that the Germans have invented a neutralizing gas which, when released into the air, can reduce the effect of other gases. However, I have only heard this said; I do not know what chemicals it is made of, nor do I know if this claim is true or false, because the Germans are keeping it secret. However, the most common and reliable method in Europe and America is the use of a mask made of rubber, connected to a breathing tube. The tube is connected to a canister containing a drug that absorbs the poisonous gas (this drug is said to be made from charcoal made by burning pine, cypress, or coconut wood, but it must be processed through complicated chemical procedures). Given the current state of our country’s chemical facilities, not to mention the production of poison gas, even the production of activated carbon that absorbs poison gas is impossible, because this charcoal must be extremely pure, and all the smoke produced during burning must be removed using chemical methods). Because there are many different types of poison gas, methods of defense cannot be uniform. Carbon-based charcoal powder is effective against chlorine gas, but phosgene gas can only be defended against by wetting soda lime in the canister. Furthermore, for arsenic-based poison gas, ordinary canisters are useless and require specially made filter paper with dozens of layers (the filter paper is made from the pith of tree stems). As for mustard gas, the king of poison gases, which is extremely potent, in addition to wearing a mask to protect the eyes and respiratory system, one must wear a protective suit made of oiled cloth, covering the entire body from head to toe without leaving any gaps. Speaking of this, if the enemy were to use ten tons of mustard gas, they could completely destroy a large city, because masks and protective suits cannot be obtained in a hurry. Even if there is time for preparation, due to the lack of raw materials and the immaturity of chemical equipment, it is still impossible to prepare. There is only one thing to do, which is to wait for death with bound hands. However, pessimism is useless. Even in a hopeless situation, there may be ways to defend oneself. Although it is not enough to defend against mustard gas, it is effective against other types of poison gas. What are the methods? Here, I will describe the simplest and easiest methods below:</p>
<p>(1) Stay calm. Do not run around or exercise any part of the body.</p>
<p>(2) We should occupy high ground or be upwind, such as on the third or fourth floor of a building.</p>
<p>(3) Use a thick towel, folded into dozens of layers, and soak it in the solution below to cover the mouth and nose. If this solution is not available, use a large lump of wet mud to cover the mouth and nose, or lie down in dry grass, or bury your head in green grass, charcoal, or layers of wet wood. All of these have a slight effect. However, wood layers and solutions must be prepared in advance. We should rather have preparedness without use than use without preparedness. This is what the author means by taking up a bit of space for a small matter on the Free Talk page. The formula is: dissolve 100 grams of sodium thiosulfate and 100 grams of sodium carbonate in one liter of water. Temporarily wet dozens of towels to cover the mouth and nose.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Gold Prices Dropped</h3>
<p>Fluctuating by twenty-seven taels. Gold prices declined again last week. Times are changing, but the fluctuations are still significant, with daily differences of more than ten taels. This is due to conflicting foreign news and the still-serious situation with Japan. People are panicking. However, from the beginning of the week, prices hovered around 710 taels before trending downwards. They broke the 700-tael mark and further weakened at the weekend, falling below 90 taels before recovering slightly. Overall, prices fell by more than ten taels, totaling twenty-seven taels. The silver market and Shanghai foreign exchange rates rose, while the domestic London gold price broke below the 8 pence mark. Only the US dollar appreciated slightly, which was due to the decline in Anglo-American exchange rates. Currently, Chinese merchants are shorting about one million dollars in London gold and four to five million dollars in US dollars. Most hedgers are shorting gold. The Dalian and Guangdong gangs are still shorting, while Shunli and Taichang are occasionally covering their positions. Recently, the exchange rate with the United States is still above 60 taels. However, due to the tight credit situation, there are few buyers, and the price has been increasing by eight or nine taels. However, the current gold reserves are not abundant. Looking at the future of the gold market, there may be turbulence. Here is a summary of the situation during the week:</p>
<p>A Drop of More Than Ten Taels: From the beginning of the week (October 26), the large silver bar price fell by 0.125, the London silver price decreased by 0.025 pence, and the US dollar appreciated due to exchange rate fluctuations, so it also increased by 0.125. The domestic market was tight, and Chinese merchants were selling, while the London exchange rate was relatively loose. The initial gold price increased by slightly more than one tael and two maces, at 706.5 taels. However, due to the closure of ten banks in the United States, large buyers then entered the market, pushing the price above 710 taels, an increase of 14.6 maces. The Bombay telegram quoted the pound sterling at 17.375, and Mr. Wu and others were competing to buy. Furthermore, rumors of Japan sending more troops caused panic. Sellers became active, but at noon, the price only reached 0.058 taels and closed at 0.064 taels. In the afternoon, the market opened at 0.025 taels, riding on the momentum of the morning and with the Dalian gang leading the way to sell. Furthermore, large buyers came in, pushing the price to 0.098 taels. However, the closing price was still weak, at 0.046 taels, a decrease of 0.7 maces compared to last Saturday. There was also a fluctuation of 12.1 maces that day. The next day, the large silver bar price recovered by 0.0625, the silver price increased by 0.025 pence, and the US dollar appreciated slightly due to exchange rate fluctuations. The domestic market was stable, and fellow merchants continued to sell. When the gold market opened, it added slightly more than four cents to 705 taels. However, it was reported that the two major powers, the United States and France, were discussing a possible concrete solution to the German debt extension issue, so the gold price only reached 700 taels. Then, various firms bought in, and it was heard that the central bank injected more than a thousand bars of spot gold, which boosted confidence and raised the price to 0.088 taels. However, sellers were also not idle, and the London exchange rate seemed loose, with the noon closing price only at 0.03 taels. In the afternoon, the price opened at 0.042 taels. Then, foreign firms such as Qiao Rifu competed to buy, and the London exchange rate also rose, increasing by six to seven taels to 711 taels. The Indian exchange rate also reported a small increase. As the Russian exchange rate receded to 0.075 taels, some people sold. By the close, the price was 710 taels and 0.03 maces, a recovery of 5.7 taels compared to the previous day. The total difference was 9.2 maces. On Wednesday, the large silver bar price decreased slightly by 0.0625, the silver price decreased by 0.379 pence, and the London exchange rate remained unchanged. The domestic market was flat, and there were still many sellers. When the gold market opened, it added 0.7 maces to 711 taels, followed by 15.8 maces. The news that the United States and Britain were maintaining the gold standard boosted confidence. Later, it was suddenly heard that India was changing to the silver standard, selling gold and injecting silver bars. The market suddenly plummeted by ten taels upon receiving this news. At noon, it suddenly became 0.054 taels, then increased to 0.082 taels and recovered to 0.066 taels. In the afternoon, it recovered to 0.077 taels, followed by 0.087 taels. However, because there was no foreign exchange market on Wednesday, there was no change. Later, it closed at 0.079 taels, with very little trading, a decrease of 2.4 taels compared to the previous day. The total difference for the day was 10.4 maces. On Thursday, the large silver bar price increased by 0.125, the silver price increased by 0.025 pence, and the bank's domestic market seemed loose, but it was complex and unstable. The London exchange rate was tight in the near term and loose in the long term, and the US dollar was the opposite. This was because there were too many shorts in the gold industry. The initial gold price decreased slightly by 2.9 maces to 705 taels, because the American silver mines requested President Hoover to hold a meeting to maintain the silver price, so confidence was declining. Later, it was 0.025 taels. Afterwards, the exchange rate rose, and the atmosphere improved, jumping to 0.085 taels. Due to more buying, it decreased to 0.028 taels at noon. By the close, it was 0.037 taels. In the afternoon, it opened at 0.045 taels, followed by 0.07 taels. Trading was sparse, and it returned to 0.053 taels. By the close, it was 0.058 taels. The market was calm, so it closed early, but it was still extended to 4:30 PM after the close and reached 0.065 taels, a slight decrease of 2.1 taels compared to the posted price of the previous day. Only six taels were covered. Looking back on Friday, the large silver bar price increased by 0.0625, the silver price did not change, the London exchange rate increased by 0.125, and the US dollar did not increase due to exchange rate fluctuations. The domestic market was quite strong. The opening gold price decreased slightly by 1.3 maces to 0.045 taels, followed by 0.078 taels. After releasing the price, there were more sellers, so it decreased to 0.03 taels, then increased to 0.067 taels. However, sellers did not slacken, and the closing price was 0.037 taels. The opening price was 0.038 taels. Afterwards, the selling pressure increased, and it broke the 700-tael mark, suddenly becoming 91.8 taels. The Indian exchange rate also increased by one rupee. Afterwards, there were few buyers, so the closing price was 0.061 taels, a decrease of 9.7 taels compared to the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 16 taels for the day. On Saturday, the large silver bar price increased by 0.4375, the silver price increased by 0.75 pence, and the US dollar also increased by 0.375. However, the exchange rate decreased again, so the domestic market was strong, while the London exchange rate was flat. The opening gold price decreased to 92.5 taels. Later, it fell from 93.5 taels to 88.5 taels. Selling pressure increased because Germany was planning to mint silver coins, so confidence decreased. Afterwards, the market seemed to pick up, and sentiment improved. The exchange rate was also strong, and buyers were eager, increasing the price to 95.4 taels. At noon, it decreased slightly to 92 taels. The Guangdong gang was selling a lot, but Tongtaichang and others were trying to buy in, and the noon closing price was 94.7 taels, a decrease of 1.4 taels compared to the previous day (a total decrease of 15.6 taels in four days). There was a difference of 6.9 maces in half a day. Speculator Mr. Wu was slightly active. The high and low prices of London, American, Indian, and silver markets, exchange rates, and gold prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>London and American Silver Prices Continue to Increase</h3>
<p>India Continues to Purchase… But There Are Few Sellers</p>
<p>Yesterday (Sunday), all Chinese and foreign banks were closed as usual, so there were no reports on financial and foreign exchange markets. However, a telegram from London said that India made slight purchases, but there were few sellers, and the market was firm. The large silver bar price repeatedly increased, with the near-term price increasing by 0.375 to 18 pence 1875 and the long-term price also increasing by 0.3125 to 18 pence 125. A telegram from New York said that the American silver price also increased slightly by 0.125 to 3.075 for spot. The private telegram increased by 0.25, and the market was firm. The British exchange rate against the US dollar decreased by three points to 3 yuan 8 jiao 3 fen 25, and the American exchange rate against the British pound decreased by two points to 3 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen 75. The London-Shanghai sterling increased by 0.25 to 1 shilling 8 pence 75, and the Bombay spot increased by 8 annas to 58 rupees 08 annas. The long-term price also increased by 2 annas to 55 rupees, it was said.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit Again During Bank Holiday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit suddenly became tight again. The silver discount price was 0.037 yuan in the morning and 0.038 yuan at noon, an increase of 0.014 yuan compared to the morning of the previous day. This was because banks were closed for the weekly holiday, and the head office could not flow freely. The ocean cent market price was 0.072 yuan 7 li 3 hao 7 hu ban in the morning and 0.072 yuan 7 li 1 hao 2 hu guan at noon, slightly smaller than the noon market price of the previous day. The number of exchange transfers drawn was 1 million in the morning and 349,000 at noon. The number of banknotes was 20,000 in the morning and 40,000 at noon. The number of off-market banknotes was 75,000 in the morning and 35,000 at noon. The number of public silver notes from the money houses was more than 4.1 million, and the number of silver notes collected and delivered was more than 38 million. The transactions of small money houses were more than 300,000. The number of remittances collected and delivered from various routes was more than 600,000. The price of Jiangnan small ocean coins was 0.065 yuan 3 li ban in both the morning and at noon, slightly smaller than the previous day. The transactions were 2,500 jiao in the morning and 1,500 jiao at noon. The price of Guangdong small ocean coins was 0.065 yuan 1 li 7 hao ban in the morning and 0.065 yuan 2 li 7 hao ban at noon. The transactions were 105,000 jiao in the morning and 40,000 jiao at noon. Copper coins increased by 1,000 wen to 383,000 wen. The transactions were more than 29,000 strings.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the End of the Financial Industry in October</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday was the deadline at the end of October. Due to the complicated procedures, the closing situation of the silver and money industries could not be recorded in time, so a special supplementary record is made below: (1) On the banking side, the total amount of regular collections and deliveries on that day reached more than 30 million, and the collections and deliveries of long-term loans, mortgages, special loans, settlements, and various telegraphic transfers also reached no less than several million. (2) On the money house side, the number of silver public notes collected and delivered on that day reached as many as 89.276 million, nearly double the usual amount. The number of ocean public notes collected and delivered reached 23.173 million, as much as two or three times more. The number of various long-term settlements was even greater and could not be calculated, but it was probably no less than 40 to 50 million.</p>

<p>Weekly Report on the Bond Market Before and After Settlement</p>
<p>The market was closed for three days throughout the week due to settlements.</p>
<p>The weekend saw the opening of bids for forward scrap material submissions.</p>
<p>Prices continue to fall, and the market remains extremely quiet.</p>
<p>Last week (from October 26th to 31st), the Chinese Securities Exchange suspended market trading for three days specifically to handle settlement matters due to the month-end futures settlement period. Therefore, the settlement accounts for this month were more numerous than before. There was no trading from Wednesday to Friday. In reality, the market was only open for two days throughout the week. Spot bonds, except for the 96 bond, were all open, but transactions were sporadic. The total turnover for the three days was 59,000 yuan. Futures trading was relatively active in the first two days of the week. Because it was close to settlement, all parties actively entered and exited to settle swap contracts and seize profits. The daily turnover was estimated to be over 15 million yuan. On the last day of the week, the October futures had already been settled, and the December futures were just being launched. The market was also extremely quiet, so the market conditions were very clear. Only over 6.4 million yuan was traded. The total turnover for the two days was 36.672 million yuan, of which the December contracts only accounted for over 400,000 yuan. The October and November contracts accounted for the rest. The total amount of stamp duties was 8.97 million yuan, 20 Customs 5.695 million yuan, 20 Converted 4.465 million yuan, Salt Tax 4.425 million yuan, 19 Customs 3.36 million yuan, Disbandment 3.01 million yuan, 19 Charity 2.65 million yuan, Compilation Legacy 2.16 million yuan, Public Debt 990,000 yuan, Reorganization 6% 515,000 yuan, and Customs Duties 480,000 yuan. As for the changes in the market prices of various bonds last week, the market situation on the first day of the week was still good. There were no new developments in diplomatic relations, and the atmosphere of domestic peace and unity was very good. Therefore, people's sentiment was more optimistic than before. Although selling was quite active in the market, the buying interest was even more vibrant. The prices of various bonds mostly fell first and then rose. Therefore, the end of last week generally saw a rebound, and the 19 Charity October issue rose by more than 2 yuan. On Tuesday, the international situation suddenly became serious again. Japan not only refused to accept the League of Nations' constraints but also decided to increase troops in our Northeast, expanding the scope of its occupation and potentially triggering Russian military intervention. The market sentiment was then weakened again, and the market saw oversupply again. Bond prices fell across the board, except for the 96 bond, which only fell slightly. Other bonds fell by 1.5 to 3 yuan each. There was no trading on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. On the weekend, the December futures had already opened. The exchange abolished the system of submitting physical goods for near-term and long-term futures sales transactions. Bond prices could have rebounded slightly, but the Japanese were as tyrannical as before, plotting against us more urgently, disregarding international opinion, and the prospect of peaceful reunification still had twists and turns. People generally lacked the will to change. Major players were hesitant to take positions, and the market conditions were very bleak. The prices of various bonds fell slightly. As a result, compared to the previous week, spot goods rebounded in many varieties, while futures continued to fall by about 2 yuan. The bond market's atmosphere is more dull than before, and the future trend is difficult to predict. However, the development of diplomatic relations will still be the biggest factor in price changes. The following is a statistical breakdown of the minimum and maximum price fluctuations of various bonds last week (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Quiet Trading in Cotton Yarn Last Week</p>
<p>No Gains or Losses, Extremely Few Transactions</p>
<p>The yarn market has seen no gains or losses, and no exciting developments throughout the week. This is due to the precarious state of national affairs and the extraordinary tightness of credit. Consequently, the actual sales of domestic yarn are becoming more and more quiet and lacking in excitement. People's morale is flat and lacks invigorating spirit. However, the current yarn prices are very firm because the anti-Japanese movement is fierce, Japanese yarn cannot circulate, and domestic yarn cannot meet the supply. Therefore, although transactions have decreased, market prices can still be maintained. As for the auction yarn market, it is becoming increasingly desolate, with as many as two parties being wary of taking action due to the difficult overall situation. Therefore, businessmen are reducing their presence in the market, causing it to stagnate. Based on actual observations, there are no extreme changes in the short term, and there is a deep fear of a period of sideways movement. The prices of auction yarn for various months are similar to the previous week.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Started Firm but Weakened Last Week</h3>
<p>Spot Sales Usurped by Imported Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market was very strong at the beginning of the week. Buyers were extremely bullish, believing that U.S. cotton prices were stable and could rise further. Domestic harvests were poor, and sources of supply were limited. Therefore, domestic merchants and some bulls were keen to squeeze the market this month, and the upward pressure intensified. Although imported cotton prices rose, the exchange rate made imported cotton still cheap. Therefore, factories bought large quantities of imported cotton and showed no interest in domestic cotton because domestic cotton prices were too high. This week, factories bought about 30,000 to 40,000 bales of Indian and American cotton. The sales of domestic cotton were completely usurped by imported cotton. Therefore, speculative large players continued to sell cotton for delivery in the coming months, and the outlook remains soft. The prices of cotton for delivery in various months on the exchange were similar to last week. U.S. cotton fell by 25 points, according to reports.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Rises as Shorts Cover</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton prices were firm and active as strong shorts on Wall Street covered their positions and there were many buyers. Futures prices rose to 3 points. Spot prices were unchanged. English cotton futures rose 10 points, spot prices rose 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 5 points. Indian cotton saw European exporters selling and speculators buying, and the market was firm. Bengal rose 4 rupees, Oomra rose 2 rupees, and White Broach rose 2.75 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (telegram of the 31st).</p>

<p>The Rice Market in He Xia is Seeing Increasing Sales</p>
<p>The market in Nantou yesterday morning was still crowded with people coming to the market, and the roads to and from the city and countryside were even more active. Due to the shortage of newly arrived northern japonica rice, prices immediately increased by 20 cents. High-quality old stock in the market also saw an increase of about 10 cents. White japonica rice from Tongli, Pingwang, and the surrounding villages, as well as retail sales, were all in strong demand, with prices rising by about 30 cents. The Stone Blue Kiln variety arrived yesterday with two batches totaling 500 piculs. The entire quantity was sold out on the same day, and the price increased by half a dime. Du Yang indica rice also arrived and saw good sales. The market was stable. Demand for glutinous rice for cakes and dumplings was excellent, and prices increased by nearly 10 cents.</p>
<p>In Xinzha, the source of supply yesterday from the 27th and 28th saw better sales. A small amount of Changxi northern japonica rice was put on the market, about 1000 piculs. Buying was up 20 cents compared to the previous market. Bai Ge white paddy rice arrived and the price was good by one and a half dimes. The customer base and merchants for Lu Yang pointed rice were quite happy, and the opening price rose by 5 cents. The kiln variety of old and broken goods was still scarce, and the market was stable. Although business in the city was active, the countryside was not as brisk. However, prices were tight because people were trying to keep up.</p>

<p>Prices of Woolen Fabrics are Skyrocketing</p>
<p>Reports of Price Increases from Foreign Factories</p>
<p>In recent days, the exchange rate of foreign exchange has increased. The demand for woolen fabrics for the People's Livelihood has been extremely strong. More than 2,000 boxes have been ordered in October. Most of the drafts have been purchased at the current market price to avoid losses due to time constraints. British merchants have completed the most transactions, because it is more cost-effective to order in pounds than to order in gold. On Saturday, the foreign firms received telegrams from foreign factories reporting skyrocketing prices of woolen fabrics (partly due to the Shanghai market listing). Consequently, the prices were also sharply increased by as much as 20%. For example, single-sided waterproof raincoat fabric that was priced at 4 shillings and 6 pence when the rate was 1 shilling and 3 pence. After the draft was extended, the price continued to rise, and each yard had to be priced at 4 shillings and 7.5 pence. Recently, news has been received of skyrocketing wool prices from abroad, so the price must be set at 4 shillings and 10 pence to 5 shillings.</p>

<h3>A Call from a Passionate Youth</h3>
<p>— Qi Ru Fang</p>
<p>Last night, when I returned to my residence, the desolate moonlight filled my room. In the hazy moonlight, I saw the letter you gave me on the table. I turned on the light and read it with the excitement of a hungry eagle. But your every word and tear, filled with passion, is not made of iron. To me, this is a terrible stimulation. At the time, I felt a chill. Should I cry or laugh? I didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>Since the autumn wind blew from the Northeast, bringing with it a bloody scent, the murdering and arsonist Japanese imperialists have revealed their hideous faces. Our nation has been looked down upon by the dwarf bandits as a cowardly nation. Some are in a state of panic and terror in the tense atmosphere, shouting. The passionate blood of the patriotic youth is flowing torrentially. Alas, there are also those who dream of survival and still indulge in the drunken dreams of wine and meat. This sand-like national inferiority. What else can we say besides sighing to the heavens? We are so unfortunate to be born in this era.</p>
<p>You told me about Mr. X, a piece of news with pro-Japanese suspicions. This really surprised me. I don't know how to hate this deceiving friend who has insulted our nation.</p>
<p>Regarding the inside story of this matter, you once used a degree of investigation. This matter has left a deep impression on your mind. You can grasp it eight or nine parts, but you still don't know whether this matter came from his own initiative or from his family's passive. For a while, you could not find conclusive evidence. But once you found that the Japanese were secretly talking in his house. You used a brick to hit the Japanese who got into the car. All this, witnessed by people who understand things, does it not confirm his cold-blooded actions?</p>
<p>Also, I remember a suspicious incident. Once at dusk, I met him and talked about the problem of the Northeast suffering. He asked me for my personal opinion on how to resist Japan. I said that I would never buy Japanese goods and that I would sever diplomatic relations with Japan. Besides doing my best to publicize enlisting in the army, I was limited by my physical weakness and could not be sure whether I could shoulder a knife and gun to fight the enemy on the battlefield. In contrast, I asked him what about you? He said that his environment could not make him reluctant, and it would be a good opportunity to devote himself to joining the army. He would definitely go to be a soldier if there was a war between China and Japan. He also said that he usually has good feelings with the Japanese, and he has many Japanese friends. He likes to use Japanese goods because they are cheap and the goods are good. But now, for the sake of the motherland and for the sake of the nation, he must boycott them. At that time, I was confused by his "must boycott", but I didn't guess that he was completely insincere. I didn't know that he had pro-Japanese behavior.</p>
<p>Really, no matter what, I couldn't imagine that he, who had received higher education, only knew a few Japanese people, but he had such a good impression of the Japanese imperialists. Such a traitor who cooperates with the Japanese in business, acts as an agent to buy land, and sells the country and the people, is tolerable, and what is not tolerable? Ru Fang, you and I were previously deceived by him and admitted that he was our friend. What about now? He is an enemy that we cannot live under the same sky with. Isn't he simply a public enemy of the Republic of China?</p>
<p>You said that the relationship between Mr. X and me is not bad. Before witnessing everything, you didn't want to tell me this painful news. Now, your passionate blood is about to burst out of a red heart. Your conscience does not allow your friend to fall into the trap of this degenerate. So, you announced this man's conspiracy to me. I don't know how to thank you. I am like a small boat sailing in the dark, but you have become a guiding lighthouse. Ru Fang, you know, maybe you should have known me in the past few years of friendship. I am definitely not cold-blooded and unspiritual and willing to associate with this traitor and slave to the country. What time is it now? At the juncture of life and death, we have passion and courage. We should fight for the nation. If we can't hold a gun, we can at least shorten this gun barrel and shorten it into a five or six-inch-long pen to shout in writing.</p>

<h3>China's Five-Year Military Aviation Plan by Shu Yuan</h3>
<p>By Huang Bingheng</p>
<p>Although the invention of airplanes is only a little over twenty years old, the speed of its progress is truly astonishing. Since the European War, military strategists in all countries have focused their minds and sought to excel, focusing on aerial warfare. The evolution of war has moved from a flat surface to a three-dimensional space. Those studying national defense should not only defend ground territory but also give special defense to the airspace, because if the airspace is not protected, the ground territory will be difficult to maintain. This time, the violent Japanese occupation of our Eastern Provinces used the air force as its vanguard, bombing and strafing to the extreme. In contrast, although our country's air force has made considerable progress in internal operations, the air defense plan has not yet been completed. How can it resist foreign aggression? According to American military experts, if sixty airplanes carry sixty tons of poison gas and spread it over Tokyo, Tokyo can be placed in a desperate situation. We can observe the area, width, building structure, climate, and temperature of Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. If fifty airplanes carry fifty tons of bomb-laden poison gas and release it within four hours, the people and livestock of the cities of Pingjin and Guangzhou can be placed in a desperate situation. Furthermore, look at the British Navy, which was the best in the world, but without an air defense force, it could not stop German aircraft from bombing London. The French Army was superior among nations, but without air defense equipment, it could not stop German aircraft from attacking Paris. Moreover, our country's land and air defense undertakings lag far behind. The construction of aviation military affairs is truly urgent. Aviation expert Mr. Huang Bingheng, in view of this, has assessed the international military situation and considered the national economic strength and written the book "China's Five-Year Military Aviation Plan." In the midst of this violent Japanese aggression, not only should the military authorities regard it as a guiding principle, but also our people, who are calling for war with Japan, should understand how backward our air force is and how to build it up, and there is a need to read this book.</p>
<p>In addition to how important the air force is to national defense, the author further cited three reasons for writing this book based on the domestic environment: (1) The elements of creating a new enterprise are nothing more than talent and material resources. Talent is a matter of training, but the problem of material resources is indeed not easy to solve in China at present. In the West, material civilization already has a foundation, and new enterprises are merely expanded and processed accordingly, which is easy to implement. It is different in China, so the difficulties of aviation are even greater. For example, if there is no industrial foundation, the machinery and raw materials for aviation manufacturing cannot be obtained. If transportation is not yet developed, repair and supply are not easy to implement. If electricity has not been widely popularized, there is no way to conduct nighttime navigation. If oil mines have not yet been exploited, the fuel is all imported. There are countless examples like this. Under this kind of environment, if everyone is pessimistic and does nothing, then there is no plan for development to speak of. However, it should be known that industry, commerce, and economy have an interdependent and complementary relationship. If one does not prosper, then nothing will. Aviation is the newest and most amazing enterprise and the most advanced weapon, and it has such a huge relationship with the nation's industry, commerce, and economy. In this autumn of the weak being prey to the strong, for the sake of national survival, it is appropriate to break through from a narrow path and hope to catch up. This is one reason, from the perspective of construction, why aviation must have a plan. (2) The current aviation force has only dozens of disorganized airplanes, more than a hundred personnel with mediocre skills, and more than a dozen airfields that have not been developed. There is no foundation to speak of. However, precisely because it is like this, it is also easy to start development, just like an unblemished piece of jade or an unfinished year, where the best materials can be used for teaching and shaping it into a useful object at will. It is not like other existing enterprises that have inherited the aftermath of war and are already plagued by many complications and loopholes that need to be remedied and rectified before there is even time to consider development. This is the second reason, from the perspective of opportunity, why aviation must have a plan. (3) The government spends more than twenty million yuan per month on the army. The aviation force, from the headquarters down to the various teams, factories, and stations, including consumption and repairs, only costs 150,000 yuan. The expenses are less than one percent of the army's expenses. Many military experts have already seen this and proposed reducing the army and strengthening the air force. According to American tacticians, one well-equipped airplane with four highly skilled aircrew members can be equivalent to a division of soldiers on land. Therefore, the entire United States Army has only 120,000 soldiers, while the air force is planning to increase to more than 20,000. This is also a matter of weighing the importance and knowing the urgency. Even if the army cannot be reduced immediately, how can we abandon eating for fear of choking and stubbornly adhere to harmful times? This is the third reason, from an economic perspective, why aviation must have a plan.</p>
<p>After the author describes the reasons for writing this book, the second chapter is a summary of the plan, the third chapter is an explanation of the summary, the fourth chapter is a general estimate of the five-year plan, and the fifth chapter is a summary of the steps for annual implementation and its estimate.</p>
<p>The plan summary is divided into eight points: (1) Within five years, establish an air force with a suitable organization, with 500 elite airplanes of various types as its basic equipment. (2) During the same period, train 1,000 air force officers, 3,000 military assistants and sergeants, and 3,000 soldiers sufficient to handle the work of these 500 organized airplanes and assist in protecting them, both domestically and abroad. (3) Plan the country into twelve air force districts and, during the same period, select important locations in each district to build twelve air force bases. (4) During the same period, allocate twelve supply bureaus and a number of hangars sufficient to maintain these 500 airplanes. (5) During the same period, complete the air route plan that will allow these 500 airplanes to fly smoothly between air force districts, with 57 air stations, a number of backup airfields, and a number of aviation signs. (6) During the same period, establish more than 70 aviation radio stations and more than 50 aviation weather stations sufficient to command all activities of these 500 airplanes and ensure their safety in the air. (7) During the same period, equip air defense forces sufficient to resist low-altitude attacks. (8) During the same period, establish night flight equipment for the twelve air force bases and set up night air routes within the possible range.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned plan summary is explained in detail in the third chapter, along with precise charts. It is completely different from those who engage in armchair strategizing without any plans. The author said, "The German advisor Fuchs also proposed many plans for the construction of our country's military aviation in previous years, but he was quite unfamiliar with our country's national conditions, so it was inevitable that his plans were close to empty talk, exaggeration, and disregard for facts and possibilities... It must be known that the planning of construction undertakings must never be based on one-sided imagination or empty talk, regardless of the country's financial resources and the possibility of facts, and forcing people to do the difficult..." From this, it can be seen that the author's plan is based on actual plans and does not advocate empty talk.</p>
<p>In the fourth chapter, the general estimate of the five-year plan is divided into: (A) Regarding air force education: (1) Training 900 flight officers domestically. (2) Training 100 flight and engineering officers abroad. (3) Training 1,000 aircrew sergeants. (4) Training 2,000 technical sergeants in mechanics, gunnery, telecommunications, and meteorology. (5) Training 3,000 aviation soldiers. (6) Foreign technical instructors: 30 in the first year, decreasing thereafter. (7) Domestic technical instructors: 50 in the first year, increasing thereafter. (8) Salaries for other instructors and staff. (9) Construction and equipment of school buildings, airfields, repair shops, warehouses, and hangars. (10) Office expenses and miscellaneous expenses for school camps and warehouses. In total, the estimate for air force education is 29,130,000 yuan in national currency. (B) Regarding air force construction: (1) 500 airplanes. (2) Airplane parts. (3) 12 supply bureaus. (4) Airplane hangars located at bases and air stations. (5) Capital aviation station (large). (6) Other bases and air stations. (7) Barracks for each base. (8) Equipment for night flight and navigation. (9) A total of 51 air defense artillery weapons, accounting for 17 teams. (10) Ground transportation for each base and aerial rescue tools for each squadron, etc. In total, the estimate for air force construction is 115,630,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter summarizes the steps for annual implementation and its estimate. The summary of the first year's implementation: (1) Build and equip all five schools. (2) Train one-fifth of the total number of personnel. (3) Establish one air force aviation squadron and all necessary equipment, as well as one army aviation squadron. (4) Complete one air force base. (5) Construct nine other air stations. (6) Establish one air defense team. The estimate for the first year is 20,076,000 yuan. The summary of the second year's implementation: (1) Train one-fifth of the total number of personnel. (2) Establish two air force aviation squadrons and all necessary equipment, as well as three army aviation squadrons. (3) Establish a mixed squadron directly under the air force headquarters. (4) Complete two more air force bases. (5) Construct nine other air stations. (6) Establish seven air defense teams. The estimate for the second year is 30,916,000 yuan. The summary of the third year's implementation: (1) Train one-fifth of the total number of personnel. (2) Establish three air force aviation squadrons and two army aviation squadrons. (3) Complete three more air force bases. (4) Construct nine other air stations. (5) Establish three more air defense teams. The estimate for the third year is 31,256,000 yuan. The summary of the fourth year's implementation is the same as the third year, except that the number of domestic instructors increases while the number of foreign instructors decreases. The estimate is 31,106,000 yuan. The summary of the fifth year's implementation is still the same as the third year, except that the night flight equipment for the remaining 48 stations is completed in this year. The estimate is 31,406,000 yuan. The author has also combined the phased implementation and estimate into a table for easy viewing.</p>
<p>Although the above plan requires a huge amount of money, it can be easily completed with phased implementation. At a time when foreign aggression is becoming increasingly urgent, and flying generals are acting as the vanguard, if our country does not engage in the construction of an air force, then even this last remaining airspace will be seized by the violent. Therefore, before introducing this book to readers, I sincerely hope that the author's plan will be fully realized after five years.</p>

<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Bank announced that the Nanshi Branch of the bank has experienced rapid business development since its establishment. The managers are Mr. Tang Songshan and Mr. Ge Yuxiang. The head office has examined all the branches and found that the performance of this branch is the best. Therefore, it is specially constructing a beautiful Western-style building in the 16th Pier, which has now been completed and is scheduled to officially move in on November 2 to expand its operations.</p>
<p>The Ren Zhi Miao Ji Department Store on North Sichuan Road announced that the company will hold a winter sale for 25 days starting from November 1. All Japanese goods have been sealed by the staff sent by the Department Store Association and the Citizens' United Association, vowing never to buy or sell them again. At the same time, it will actively promote and sell domestic goods at special low prices to show its support.</p>
<p>An Sheng Company at No. 368 Jiangxi Road announced that the Jinshi Brand Beef Extract exclusively managed by the company has been issued a chemical testing form No. 114 by the Central Health Testing Institute, and its ingredients have also been announced. The beef extract was invented by the German Wattsai Company. The method is to first scientifically refine the beef juice made by machine, remove its residue, and then add human body elements to it. It contains extremely rich nourishing ingredients, so it enjoys a great reputation in Europe and the West. Although it has only recently come to China, those who have taken it have praised it highly. Recently, the sales of Jinshi Brand Beef Extract have surged unexpectedly. It is reported that Dr. Wattsai will further research and prepare a new method of beef extract and refine Jinshi Brand Tongji Juice, which will also be shipped to China and sold by the company.</p>
<p>The Wuyuan Livestock and Planting Farm in Yangjiazhai, Zhabei, announced that the farm, operated by Mr. Hong Zunshan, has been in business for three years and has achieved great results. The farm's products, such as Lake Heng White Chicken eggs, chicken breeds, various famous goldfish, and forest fruit seedlings, all grow rapidly and are of excellent quality. However, because the farm is located in a remote area, it is often difficult for visitors to find their way. In response to the requests of people from all walks of life, a retail department has been added at No. 681 North Sichuan Road (north of the Guangdong Grand Theater). The preparations are nearing completion and it will be opened soon.</p>
