<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界對於銀賤問題與經濟恐慌</h3>
<p>凡事不僅屬於一己切膚之痛。及非一己之力量所能補救。决不肯出其全力。以爲之圖謀。雖人人知其事之重大與緊要。且亦人人受其痛苦。并時時有人提議而謀補救。然而終不能上切實之途者。則以現在所受之痛苦。非一人所獨受。將來補救所得之利益。非一人所獨享。且於補救之時。盡力者必將有所犧牲。不盡力者或可於中取利。故相持而不肯先發。此人情之常。雖知之而莫可如何者也。人與人間之事。國與國間之事亦復如是。今日世界所謂最大問題之經濟恐慌與全貴銀賤。亦呈此情形也。</p>
<p>世界之經濟恐慌與銀賤問題各國皆有人調查。皆有人提議以謀補救。如美國之參院如英國之下議院。提案討論。視爲重事。各國之經濟學。又將於下月一日。在日瓦内集議。然料其結果。所成就必鮮。何也。以上述理由之故。各國之執政與有力者。决無决心與實力。獨任艱鉅以實行之也。</p>

<h3>廣州一瞥記　李慶多</h3>
<p>廣東爲革命策源地。於歷史上地理上均佔重要地位。昔孫哲生部長任廣州市政廳長時。整頓市政。不遺餘力。拆城築路。悉心建設。廣州市得以煥然一新。余不返粤中故里。瞬將十載。爰於一月間抽暇南旋一行。雖勾留僅兩星期。而五羊城中所睹景物。不乏足述者。特拉雜誌之如次。</p>
<p>▲狹道　康莊　廣州當局近年將全城馬路積極舖築。狹小之街道亦逐漸拆卸。改築馬路。車馬往來。咸稱便利。市中汽車比前增多。由廣州市至河南。亦設備小電輪　以爲渡江之用。此爲近年新建設之一　。惟市中街道新關馬路者。多已易名。久别歸來。途多不識。大有人民猶是。城郭已非之概。</p>
<p>▲粤秀山勝景　粤秀山原名觀音山。在廣州市之東北角。昔龍濟光督粤時。踞爲龍窟。隱匿於此。在山上建有砲壘多座。居高臨下。睥睨一切。今此山已闢爲粤秀公園。修築一新。廢壘已被炸毁。遊者至此。不禁興今昔之感。有鎭海樓居於山巓。近年市長林雲陔將樓重修。改爲博物院。倩立法院長胡展堂故行政院長譚組菴等　親筆題聯於其上。樓爲五層。登樓遠望。目窮千里。珠江美景。一覽無遺。</p>
<p>▲東山冠蓋忙　東山在廣州市外之東方。前臨珠江。後背白雲粤秀兩山。景色秀麗。粤省府主席陳銘樞。第八路總指揮陳濟棠。粤財廳長范其務諸公。皆擇居於此、每　冠蓋如雲。汽車不絶於道。軍警保</p>
<h3>南極探險之忠犬慘死　·志·政</h3>
<p>美國堡德大佐。於一九二八年冬偕隊員五十餘人。至南極探險結果大告成功。爲科學界放一異彩。該隊探險詳情。曾由志政譯登旅行雜誌。（五卷一期至四期。）堡德大佐生平最愛一狼犬。名之曰恩阿拉斯加。寢食不離。南極探險時。堡德派爲犬隊領袖忠勇無匹。堡德歸國。該犬亦聲名大噪。不幸　在路多易西亞那州之孟祿城。爲一汽車碾斃。聞者咸悼惜不置。堡德尤覺悲痛。日前安葬。執紼者有官員。學生。童子軍及民衆等二千餘人。誠空前盛事。亦可見外人對科學有功者重視之一斑也。</p>
<p>衞甚週。近更闢有東山模範區、不久大興土木。建築屋宇。國府文官長古湘芹。亦置宅於區内。備將來在此休養。廣州地方雖廣。然多數人俱愛東山。視彼不啻世外桃源也。</p>
<p>▲東陽花事淡　廣州花事。曩以東隄爲最熱閙。秦樓楚館。畫舫花艇。多集於此。今以頻年受時局影響與軍事騷動。花界生涯。大受打擊。東隄一帶之酒樓。俱已歇業。妓館亦悉他遷。所有畫舫花艇。同時駛離。散泊長隄一帶。說者謂盛極必衰。不其然歟。</p>
<p>▲公園中聽戲　省政府之右有第一公園。面積頗廣。佈置尚雅潔。花木繁植。園内裝有無綫電話、凡各地唱戲用無綫電播音者。均能收聽。並有無綫電播音台。每日播放粤曲數次。粤人多喜粤曲。黄昏後。到園靜聽者甚衆。粤中天氣較暖。雖屆冬令。遊人不减。蓋入園不須付費。且可聽歌。故市民多樂趨之。</p>

<h3>樽前談笑錄　秋郎</h3>
<p>疇昔之夕。友人邀宴於其寓廬、共席者皆舊識、且有挾細君與俱者。肴核倍極豐盛。主人尤殷勤勸飲。以是闔座歡然。嗣有倡行酒令者。謂社會上宴會之際、輒助以與戰。此舉煩囂逼人。殊無樂趣之可言。今夕吾等可述一故事或諧語。以充酒令。但須含有趣味者爲上。衆然之。由是各調妙舌。談笑風生。茲擇其有雋趣者。錄之以博一粲。</p>
<p>▲駕返蘇杭　甲友之言曰。俗有上有天堂下有蘇杭之語。良以蘇杭風景優美。氣候温和。物産豐盈。在在足以引起他方人士之艷羨。而更以北地燕冀諸省之人。尤眷念此聞名之樂土。實則吾等生長於斯者。反不覺有若何之樂趣。彼謂北地遇有戚友之喪時。其致送之素軸。所綴之金字。每有用「駕返蘇杭」四字。懸諸中庭者。卽與南方人所撰用「駕返蓬島」駕返瑤池」之意同。然彼處人士之渴慕蘇杭。於此可見一斑已。</p>

<h3>浣溪紗　宣閣</h3>
<p>▲白雲樓夜歸</p>

<h3>詠梅二首　叔琴</h3>
<p>丹雲匝地·玉屑飛天·時値寒假·深喜寒梅爲伴·因詠此·</p>
<p>冰心素質見天眞。嶺上風光倍有神。獨肯臨靑輸白雪。逋仙已去更何人。</p>

<h3>心上温馨（三七五）　包天笑</h3>
<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷眉蛾命　續無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>其實中國也用不着那種最新式的軍械。兩敵相爭。要對方用什麽傢伙我方也用什麽傢伙。這就是刀來刀架。槍來槍迎。現在中國的敵人。也是用那們舊式軍械。那末這一方。比他們稍高一二籌。也便足夠了。就是那些舊軍械。也非請教舶來品不可。那就是中國夠傷心的一件事。葉桐侯因爲在上海人頭很熟。他也能說幾句普通的英國語。所以和平洋行就請他做了一位華經理。他的朋友。又都是革命份子居多。有什麽軍械交易。也都和他秘密進行。他在外面交游很多。應酬又廣。因此在上海北里中。提起了葉三少。差不多没有一個人不知道。今天他來。問着花元春道。老六。我聽說你要到北京去咧。花元春道。你怎麽知道的。信息眞靈呵。是誰告訴你的。葉桐侯道。我早就知道了。我是最留心時事的。幾時動身。花元春道。後天晚上就動身了。我也從來没有到過北京。不知道住得慣住不慣。聽他們說。天氣很冷咧。葉桐侯道。天氣雖然比上海冷一點。可是没有關係。因爲北方人的屋子裏。都是有火爐的。我倒覺得北京氣候。比南邊還好。南邊那種潮濕。和黄梅天氣。在北方是没有的。而且天晴的日子多。有一回。我住在北京有三月之久。簡直没有下過一次雨。我現在不久又要到北京去了。或者下星期就走也說不定。花元春正苦到了北京。没有找得到熟客。而且葉三對於堂子裏人。是寬厚的。就是和自己的感情也不壞。便道。三少。眞個你就要到北京來嗎。那你一定要來看我的呀。你到慶餘堂一問就知道。倘然我没有進塲。總是住在中央飯店等各旅館。我就怕到北京以後。舉目無親。你倘然來了以後。我就當你是親人了。葉桐侯道。你現在是這樣說。一到了北京。做到了一兩戸好客人。再也不顧到我們這班老朋友了。花元春道。三少。你旣然說是老朋友。你總知道我花老六的脾氣。當然吃堂子飯的人。總是想弄幾個錢。但是我倒不是專門在「銅錢眼裏翻飭斗」的人。我要專門弄錢的話。也不至於窮到連盤纒錢也要想法子了。我們老朋友總是老朋友。你說這話。你就不像我們是老朋友了。葉桐侯笑道。我是說一句笑話。你就急得這樣。到了北京。我一定就來看你。說時。曳了一曳伊的袖子。說我和你談一句話。</p>

<p>▲原有茶房　怡和洋行公和輪船、係行駛滬漢班頭、上海停於虹口公和祥碼頭、前任買辦高文斌接事時、曾帶來茶房三十八人、每人均由高收取押櫃金、計分三種、官艙洋三百元、房艙洋一百八十元、統艙則一百四十元、惟該輪尚有老茶房八十名、均係中華海員聯合總會會員、在歷任買辦内、向未繳給押櫃金、故高接手後、仍照例未繳、高亦漠然不問、上下相</p>
<p>自己職務轉讓與沈華亭接管、</p>
<p>▲拒繳押櫃　沈新買辦、向在太古公司福建班萬流輪船、滬漢班洞庭輪船、及招商局漢班江天輪船等三輪上、充任買辦、嗣萬流輪營業不佳、當局命令停駛、而洞庭輪又中途遇險沉没、沈之兩輪職務、先後被撤、惟江天上照常供職、沈乃再謀公和買辦之職、適該輪買辦高文斌有去職意、遂一談而合、高讓職後、所有前收三十八個茶房之押櫃金、則議定完金由沈承担、沈接手後、見尚有老茶房八十名、認爲亦應繳付押櫃金、以符平等、但該八十人以歷屆買辦任内、後無此議、故表示堅决拒絶、</p>
<p>▲迫繳執照　沈以事未如願、不久另招新茶房四十人、每人均收押櫃金、計官艙洋四百元、房艙洋三百元、統艙洋二百元、新茶房預備登輪接事、但老茶房不允卸職、致新茶房無從工作、日惟坐臥輪上、食由沈一人供給、沈見長此以往、終非佳計、本月十九晚、該輪泊於滬埠、沈在岸招得大漢數人、登輪强迫老茶房繳銷執照、内有官艙頭目袁德泉不服、故被沈掌頰兩下、老茶房見事不佳、亦上岸招得多人、登輪示威、沈乃乘間走避、當晚該輪新茶房完全捲舖蓋上岸而去、翌日（二十）該輪照班起椗赴漢、詎歸滬途中、新茶房已守候蕪湖、預備動武矣、</p>

<p>▲船員避禍　當械鬥發生時、船内各船員、恐遭波累、紛紛逃入臥室、將門禁閉、不敢出外、船主康比爾。在此事發生時、原擬發警號、請附近英艦兵士、到輪制止、而沈買辦上前勸阻、謂係驅逐老茶房、無須外兵干涉乃止、迨打過以後、其有未被拖去之老茶房、不敢再到大艙、恐復遭毒打、各人乃分避在貨艙、及機器間等處、其職務卽由蕪湖上輪新茶房代執之、</p>
<p>▲發電求援　公和輪於二十五日開到南京時、被害老茶房、潛行登陸、至電報局發電來滬、報告工會、並陳在蕪被打後捉去同事二十餘人、迄無著落、請工會主持援助、工會得電、卽向本埠水陸捕房報告、候船到時、捕捉行兇之人、</p>
<p>▲買辦被拘　該輪於蕪湖停留兩小時、下駛抵京、而沈卽由下關登岸、改乘火車回滬、但本埠海員聯合總會早已得報、故派人在京滬車站守候、沈於前晚夜車抵滬、卽被該會人員瞥見、報告路警、將沈拘住、聞沈身畔藏有手槍、亦被警搜出、人槍一併暫押路局、候轉送地方法院發落、</p>
<p>▲凶手拘獲　昨日下午一時二十分、輪船行駛到埠、水巡捕房已於晨間接得海員聯合總會公函、囑請查拘是案禍首、故由捕頭飭派西探長龐士、華探程永年·黄震林·鄧嘉庚·胡長靑·吳榮生·黄松生·並帶同中西武裝巡捕二十餘人、分乘小輪、前往該輪左右監守、以防禍首脫逃、同時公共租界捕房、亦派武裝探捕多名、到場協助、待輪停靠已畢、水巡捕房人員卽上輪大施搜查、在新茶房居處搜出鐵條三根、斧頭三柄、刀兩把、鐵鎖子兩只、鐵梗二十餘根、旋撞見新茶房頭目胡漢章、向之盤詰、面色頓現灰白、自稱係輪上賬房、忽去乘客、但老茶房認識之、故報明探等、當場扣留、連同老茶房頭目丁永昌、一併帶回捕房、行兇鐵器、亦移至捕房暫存、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The World's Views on the Silver Debasement Problem and Economic Panic</h3>
<p>People are only willing to exert their full strength on matters that are not only of personal concern but also beyond their individual ability to remedy. Although everyone knows the importance and urgency of the matter, and everyone suffers from it, and people are constantly proposing and seeking remedies, yet in the end it cannot be put on a practical path, it is because the suffering now endured is not borne by one person alone, and the benefits of future remedies are not enjoyed by one person alone. Moreover, those who exert their efforts in remedying the situation will inevitably make some sacrifices, while those who do not exert their efforts may profit from it. Therefore, they hold each other back and are unwilling to take the initiative. This is human nature, although it is known, there is nothing that can be done about it. The same is true of matters between people and matters between countries. Today's world's so-called biggest problems, economic panic and universal silver debasement, also present this situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the world's economic panic and silver debasement problem, countries have people investigating, and people are proposing to seek remedies. For example, the US Senate and the British House of Commons have proposed and discussed them as important matters. Economists from various countries will also meet in Geneva next month on the first day. However, it is expected that the results will be minimal. Why? Because of the reasons mentioned above, the rulers and powerful people of various countries have no determination or strength to take on the heavy burden and implement it.</p>

<h3>World Unemployment Demonstrations</h3>
<p>Communists Issue Orders</p>
<p>Disturbances Occur Everywhere</p>
<p>▲ National News, Berlin, 25th: Today is the World Day of Struggle Against Unemployment initiated by the Third International. Although authorities in various countries are on high alert and strictly prohibit gatherings and parades, serious clashes have occurred in Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, and several Balkan capitals. There have been several deaths and dozens of injuries. Although Berlin is where the Third International issues orders, the police are heavily guarding it. When they see unemployed people gathering to disrupt order, they immediately disperse them with batons. Fortunately, no major incidents have occurred, but over two hundred people have been arrested. It is feared that disturbances may occur at night.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 26th: Yesterday, Wednesday, was the day called by the Communist Party for unemployed people around the world to demonstrate. Disturbances occurred in many European cities. The most serious was in Leipzig, Germany, where rioters attacked the police, who retaliated. As a result, three demonstrators were killed and eight injured. There were also disturbances in Berlin, where the labor bureau and food stores were destroyed by the unemployed. In Paris, over a hundred unemployed people were arrested by the police as they were about to march. There was also unrest in Barcelona, Spain, but it was quickly suppressed by the police. In the capitals of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Luxembourg, there were clashes between rioters and the police. Fifty demonstrators were also arrested in the capital of Denmark. There was no such action in Britain.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 25th: The International Anti-Unemployment Movement Day ordered by the Third International headquarters (25th) was set for a large demonstration parade at 4:00 PM on the 25th by the National Council headquarters sending a secret order to the Tokyo branch. The Metropolitan Police Department, upon learning of this, feared that it would lead to violence against the Diet, urgently summoned all police officers for serious alert. By 3:00 PM, over a thousand people had arrived at the venue. The police arrested 120 people and are currently interrogating them. It is reported that they are all left-wingers, including many Koreans.</p>
<h3>British Government Prepares for Imperial Economic Conference</h3>
<p>To be Held in Canada This Year</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 25th: The British government is currently preparing for the Imperial Economic Conference, which is scheduled to be held in Ottawa, Canada, this year.

<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Agrees to Mediate Romanian-Russian Dispute</h3>

It is rumored that during this trip, Rushtu will observe whether there is a possibility of reconciling Romania and Russia.

<h3>British House of Commons Inquires About Hong Kong's Monetary System</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 25th: Today, several members of the House of Commons again raised the issue of Chinese currency and the relationship between Chinese currency and Hong Kong currency. This issue is quite important, as it would be unwise for Hong Kong to adopt the gold standard while China still uses silver. However, if China adopts the gold standard, Hong Kong must be prepared, otherwise it would be detrimental to accumulate a lot of cheap silver. Liberal MP Shakespeare asked if the Foreign Secretary had consulted with relevant countries on economic or other financial methods to help the Chinese government restore its domestic and foreign trade. Deputy Foreign Secretary Dalton replied that he had not, but the British government was quite excited to see the Chinese National Government's area of jurisdiction expanding and the situation becoming more stable, and hoped to encourage it with the recently passed Chinese Indemnity Act. When a member asked about Sir Arthur Salter, the Director of the League of Nations Economic and Financial Section, visiting China, Dalton replied that Salter's visit to China was on behalf of the League of Nations, not on behalf of any country. Conservative MP Cazalet asked if Salter's trip would ultimately involve the issue of stabilizing silver prices. Dalton did not answer this question. A member also inquired about the financial investigation team going to Hong Kong. Deputy Colonial Secretary Hilders replied that the investigation team would immediately go to Hong Kong to investigate the monetary system there and prepare a report. The investigation team includes Clegg, the Director of the South African Federal Reserve Bank, and two members of the Colonial Office. The members departed from Britain on February 26 and will meet with Clegg in Singapore. The investigation team will report everything to the Colonial Secretary, but the Colonial Office must consult with the Hong Kong government before deciding on a plan based on the investigation's recommendations. If it is necessary to consult with other relevant parties, it will also be done. A member also asked if the investigation team had the power to consult with the Chinese government and consider the Chinese monetary system. Hilders replied that the investigation team could consider related matters, but its complete focus was on the Hong Kong monetary system.</p>
<h3>Japan's Warship Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Significant Contradictions Discovered</p>
<p>Proletarian Faction Demands Withdrawal from Parliament</p>
<p>▲ Den Tsushin, Tokyo, 26th: Uchida of the Seiyukai party, at yesterday's closed-door meeting of the House of Representatives Tax Reduction Committee, demanded the presentation of the warship construction list and the warship disposal list, and questioned Naval Minister Anbo. As a result, the following significant contradictions were discovered in the warship construction plan: According to the warship construction plan presented to the budget general meeting</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Continuation of important foreign telegrams</p>
<p>and the detailed budget statement, the destroyers to be built in the Showa 6th year should have been nine belonging to the old plan and three belonging to the new plan, totaling twelve ships for which construction funds were requested. However, according to the warship construction list, the old plan was reduced by one, only eight, totaling eleven ships. Also, the submarines to be built in the Showa 6th year, according to the detailed budget statement, should have been four belonging to the old plan and one belonging to the new plan, totaling five. However, according to the warship construction list, the new plan was increased by two, totaling seven. Furthermore, the government stated at the budget general meeting that submarines reaching the treaty age of thirteen years by the Showa 11th year would be disposed of, but according to the warship disposal list, submarines with an age of eleven years were to be disposed of. When Mr. Uchida exposed these contradictions, Naval Minister Anbo defended himself vigorously, saying that the number of destroyers to be built in the Showa 6th year, as stated in the warship construction list, was a mistake of eight instead of nine, because the Kirisame ship had not yet been completed. Since there was no budget, it was improper. The two submarines would be cancelled immediately after construction began. However, since the deception in the warship construction plan had been completely exposed by Uchida's questioning, the defects in the tax reduction issue had already been revealed, so the fate of the tax reduction bill was being viewed with great importance by all parties.</p>

Others do so because of poor exam results. Of these 906 people, 514 are male and 392 are female.</p>

<h3>Northeast Communications Committee Sends Representatives to Attend Commercial Transport Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ Zou En Yuan Passes Through Tianjin to Go South</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Ministry of Railways has scheduled to hold a national commercial transport meeting on March 1. Railways across the country and chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities will send representatives to attend and deliberate, with the aim of completing it in ten days. After that, a transport meeting and a national railway intermodal transport meeting will be held for ten days each. The Northeast Communications Committee, having previously received a consultation from the Ministry of Railways, instructed each route to prepare to send representatives to attend. The committee also decided to send Zou En Yuan, the director of the Road Administration Office, to attend and deliberate. Ten routes, including Beining, Hu Hai, Qi Ke, Si Tao, Ji Chang, Tao Ang, Ji Dun, Tao Suo, Ji Hai, and Shen Hai, jointly requested Zou to represent each of these routes in attending. Zou has already departed on the Capital-Beiping-Liaoning Special Express at 12:10 AM on the night of the 23rd. Because Gao Jiyi, the chairman of the committee, went to Tianjin on the 19th, Zou must meet with Chairman Gao in Tianjin to make a request, and plans to stay for one day before going south. It is reported that the Communications Committee has proposed three cases for the commercial transport meeting. The contents are: (1) Regarding the Ministry of Railways' order for each route across the country to increase passenger and freight rates, the Northeast routes have special circumstances and have not increased prices, and are recently preparing to reduce prices to benefit commercial transport and facilitate travel. Railways are public transportation agencies, and their fares must be low and fair, so that the railway business can develop. It is argued that each railway across the country should not increase prices. (2) Railways have never been responsible for the safekeeping of commercial transport goods, and merchants have suffered many losses. Since the Northeast routes implemented responsible transportation of goods, the results have been quite extensive. Each route across the country should uniformly handle this. (3) Merchants are mostly responsible for paying taxes and duties for commercial transport goods, and the railway bureau usually does not intervene, which is inconvenient for merchants. The Northeast routes have long implemented a prepayment method for the formalities of paying taxes and duties for commercial transport goods by the railway bureau, and then collect the amount from each consignee after the goods arrive at the destination. Each route across the country should uniformly handle this. As for the railway transport meeting proposals, there are more than ten cases, most of which are part of the preliminary proposals that the Northeast Communications Committee will soon convene a transport meeting to propose.

<h3>Eighth Route Army Stationed in Guangxi Returns to Guangdong in Succession</h3>
<p>▲ The returnees include Zhang's Brigade and Li's Division</p>
<p>▲ The second batch has arrived in Wuzhou, and the third batch has left Binyang</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the realization of peace in Guangxi, the Eighth Route Army troops have gradually returned to Guangdong. The general situation was seen in yesterday's newspaper. After further investigation, the Eighth Route Army troops are divided into three batches and returned east one after another. The first batch is the First Independent Brigade of Zhang Ruigui's troops and the Huang Zhiwen Brigade of the 126th Division of the 63rd Division of Li Yangjing's troops. The second batch is the Huang Renhuan Brigade of the Training Brigade. The third batch is the 59th Division of Yu Hanmou's troops and the Independent Regiment, etc. Those who have returned east in recent days include the two regiments of Zhang Jingcheng and Wang Yuan of Zhang Ruigui's brigade. After arriving in the province, they went to Shantou to be stationed. On the 19th, Zhong Fangjun's regiment of the brigade and Lin Bin's troops of the Supplementary Regiment of the 126th Brigade of the 63rd Division arrived in the province from Wuzhou. Today (22nd), they boarded the Fuan warship and transferred to Chaoshan. As for the 251st Regiment of Ye Shouyao's troops and the 252nd Regiment of Ouyang Xin's troops under the jurisdiction of Huang Zhiwen of the 126th Brigade of the 63rd Division, they had already arrived in Wuzhou from Tengxian on the 18th. On the 20th, they took dozens of civilian ships and went down the West River, and are expected to arrive in the province today. It is said that after Huang's brigade arrives in the province, it will transfer to Beijiang and be stationed in northern Guangdong with Huang Yanzhen's brigade to consolidate the defense of the area and undertake the work of suppressing bandits in Beijiang. Since the entire division of Division Commander Li is returning to Guangdong, there is no need to establish a division headquarters in Wuzhou, and the troops are ordered to be stationed in Beijiang, so the division headquarters should be moved to Shaoguan to facilitate office work. Deputy Chief of Staff Xu was ordered to quickly end the division headquarters in Wuzhou to facilitate the relocation to Shaoguan. As for the first regiment of Zhang Zhiying's troops, the second regiment of Zeng Youren's troops, and two battalions of Wang Dinghua's troops of the third regiment of Huang Renhuan's brigade of the second batch of returning troops, they also left the Binyang front line on the 14th, arrived in Guixian on the 16th, arrived in Xunzhou on the 19th, and all arrived in Pingnan and Dahuanjiang on the 20th. Today they should be able to arrive in Wuzhou (waiting for ships to return to Guangdong. As for the third batch of returning troops, the Chen Hanguang troops of the Guard Regiment, the Fan Dexing troops of the First Independent Regiment, and the Yu Hanmou troops of the 59th Division, once the Huang Renhuan Brigade returns to the province from Wuzhou, the third batch of troops will return to Wuzhou from Guixun and concentrate for orders. It is estimated that in the future, Yu's division will take the West River of Guangdong as its defense area. (February 21)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Stops Handling Wuhu Rice and Stone</h3>
<p>▲Because the Anhui government levies fees for transporting rice to Guangdong</p>
<p>▲Unanimous Cessation of Transportation Until the Fee is Abolished</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The food supply of Guangdong Province has always relied on external sources. Besides ordering rice and stone from Annam and Siam, much of it comes from Wuhu. Therefore, the transportation of Wuhu rice to Guangdong has a very extensive sales route throughout the year, and its price fluctuations have a significant impact on the livelihood of the people of Guangdong. Recently, the Anhui government suddenly announced the collection of passport fees for rice and stone transported to Guangdong, which immediately increased the cost of Wuhu rice. Guangdong rice merchants stationed in Wuhu found it particularly difficult to purchase rice and stone. After receiving a telegram from the Guangdong Rice Merchants' Association, they telegraphed the central government a few days ago, requesting them to order the Anhui government to abolish the passport fees for rice and stone transported to Guangdong as soon as possible, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and maintain the people's food supply. However, recently the Anhui government continued to collect passport fees for rice and stone as before. The Guangdong Rice Bran Distribution Industry Association and the Peanut, Sesame, and Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association specially convened a general meeting to discuss countermeasures. On the 19th, it was resolved to telegraph the central government on one hand, and strictly order the rice merchants' associations in Shantou and Chaoyang, as well as the Ningbo and Yantai rice guilds, to unanimously stop handling Wuhu rice and cease transportation to strive for change. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan, which said: "To President Chiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance Song, Anhui Provincial Department of Finance is imposing an exorbitant passport fee on rice and stone exported to Guangdong. We previously received your order to immediately abolish it and strictly prohibit extortion and harassment. However, on the 1st and 2nd of this month, we received a telegram from the Wuhu Guangzhao Public Association stating that the order from the Yuan to stop the rice passport fee was ineffective, and the Anhui authorities are forcibly collecting it with military force at a rate of four jiao per shi. Please vigorously strive for a resolution. This action by the Anhui government is clearly in violation of your order and hinders the people's livelihood. After a joint meeting of our associations, it was resolved to unanimously cease handling the matter to promote awareness. We are sending this telegram for your review and respectfully request that you send personnel to investigate and handle the matter, reiterate the previous order, and strictly order the Anhui government to immediately abolish the rice and stone passport fee, which would be a great blessing for the people's food supply." The Guangdong Rice Bran Distribution Industry Association and the Peanut, Sesame, and Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association respectfully bow and affix their seals. The telegrams sent to the Wuhu Guangdong Rice Guild, and the Shantou, Chaoyang, Ningbo, and Yantai Rice Merchants' Associations, generally stated: "The Anhui Province is defying the central government's orders and forcibly collecting a rice passport fee of four jiao per shi, which is completely unacceptable. The factory associations and others have jointly resolved to unanimously cease handling the matter. Violators will be fined one yuan per package. If your place undermines the joint action, we will never trade with you." (February 22nd)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Exempts Inspection Fees for Inland Goods</h3>
<p>▲Commodity Inspection Bureau Handles According to Ministry Order</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since its establishment, the Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau has been collecting inspection fees for all goods, whether exported or sold inland. Because the inspection fees were heavy, merchants in this city once requested the bureau to exempt inspection fees for goods sold inland in order to show consideration, but this request was not granted. As a last resort, the merchants convened a meeting of the Xingzhan Industry Association on the 17th of last month, resolving to telegraph the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and various party and government agencies in this city, appealing for the exemption of inland inspection fees to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. After receiving the submission, the Ministry of Industry agreed to the request and specially instructed the bureau to comply. After receiving the order, the bureau decided to exempt the fees starting from the 23rd of this month. In addition to posting a notice, they also sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to forward to various merchants for compliance. The letter to the Chamber of Commerce stated: "According to the Ministry of Industry's Commercial Letter No. 1035, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Qingdao Xingzhan Industry Association have telegraphed one after another, requesting the exemption of inspection fees for goods sold domestically in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Since the merchants have pleaded for hardship, due consideration should be given. You should comply immediately, except for goods that require thorough inspection and those with special circumstances. All goods not for export should be exempt from inspection fees, etc." Upon receiving this order, we must comply. However, the types of goods that should be excluded must be determined by the Ministry. In addition to waiting for the order from the Ministry before instructing the merchants to comply, it is hereby decided to comply with the implementation starting from February 23rd."

<h3>Tragic Fire in Qingdao Slum</h3>
<p>▲Spreads to Over Two Hundred Households</p>
<p>▲More Than Two Thousand Refugees</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Zangtugou area at the north end of Guanxian Road, Xiling, Qingdao, is where the poor gather. The area is full of one-story wooden houses, built side by side, housing a total of 770 households. At around 1:00 PM today (the 23rd), a fire suddenly broke out. The flames soared into the sky, and the cries of children and women were unbearable to hear. As a result, over 200 houses were burned down, leaving the inhabitants exposed to the elements and awaiting rescue. About 2,000 men, women, children, and elderly were left homeless. The disaster is extremely serious. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
<p>Because the slum's wooden houses were extremely flammable, the Public Security Bureau had planned to ban and order their demolition as a preventative measure. However, due to the onset of winter, they could not bear to leave the poor with no place to live and did not implement the plan. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 PM on the 23rd, Wei Mingshan, a resident of house number 59, due to making oil and frying fish, the heat was too intense, igniting the oil and spreading to the wooden walls. Moreover, with a strong north wind, the fire became uncontrollable. In less than an hour, more than 200 houses had already been burned down. Fortunately, it was daytime, and men and women had already escaped, so no one was buried in the fire. However, other than the clothes on their backs, they had nothing left, which is truly tragic. When the fire broke out, the Chinese and Japanese fire brigades rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. However, the fire had already become a conflagration, so they did their best to put it out. However, the fire was fierce, and water was scarce. The fire was only slightly subdued by 2:30 PM, and it was not until 4:00 PM that it was extinguished. Afterwards, the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, considering that most of the victims were poor people with no one to rely on, who had suffered this disaster, and were pitiable in the cold and hunger, jointly planned relief measures. They jointly issued a notice that all victims should first register at the Ningbo Guild Hall, and then carefully plan the aftermath based on the number of registered people. In addition, a portion of the empty rooms in Tuandao was allocated to temporarily accommodate the general refugees. According to the investigation, over 200 households have already registered, and about 2,000 people are exposed to the elements without a place to go and urgently need relief. As for whether there were any casualties, it is still under investigation. (February 23rd)</p>

(1) A proposal by the Wuxi representative to amend Article 4 of the Ministry's promulgated outline and the entire text of Article 8 of the supplementary measures was resolved to be adopted. The chairmen designated Qian Sunqing, Xu Yao, Cheng Ganqing, Zhu Shilin, Zhu Minyu, Tu Shusan, Wang Jingting, Wu Tixian, and Hu Jianchun as the drafting committee, with Qian Sunqing responsible for convening the committee. (2) The representatives from Zhenze and Wujiang proposed that opinions on the special tax rates should be contributed before their promulgation to avoid harming the people. It was resolved that the provincial office should draft the proposal and that merchants' opinions should be collected before the tax rates are promulgated. (3) The proposal to organize a joint provincial chamber of commerce federation was resolved as follows: 1. The provincial office should send a letter to each county's chamber of commerce, inquiring whether they have been reorganized in accordance with the law, and requesting a response before the end of March. 2. The fifteen chambers of commerce that have been reorganized in accordance with the law should take the lead in applying to the Party headquarters for permission to establish a preparatory committee for the provincial chambers of commerce federation meeting. (4) The Wujiang representative proposed to use the proceeds from the sale of treasury bonds by the various customs offices in the province to contribute to the central Party headquarters' construction fund. It was resolved that each county should make donations voluntarily. (5) It was decided that the review of all written opinions would take place at 9:00 AM on the 26th. The drafting committee would also serve as the review committee. In the afternoon, the review report and the opinions of various counties were discussed. The opinions of various counties were summarized as follows: 1. Business tax cannot be levied until all similar miscellaneous taxes are completely abolished. 2. Business tax should not be levied on goods. 3. Business revenue should be based on the original purchase price of goods. 4. Wholesale businesses should be reduced or exempt from tax. 5. The tax rate should be re-determined based on social conditions. 6. Those who have already paid central taxes should be excluded. 7. Following the example of Anhui Province, all tax rates should not exceed two per thousand. 8. Tax collection procedures should be simplified to avoid disturbances. 9. Inland tax rates should not be higher than Shanghai, and the collection period should not be earlier than Shanghai. 10. Chinese and foreign merchants should be taxed equally. 11. Jiangsu Province has not suffered much from the abolition of customs duties, so excessive taxation should not be imposed. 12. The grain, wine, soy sauce, and distilleries industries should be excluded. 13. Silk and satin are not luxury goods and this should be corrected. 14. Handmade cloth should be exempt from tax. 15. Hotels, restaurants, and firecracker businesses have already paid business tax and should be exempt from miscellaneous taxes. 16. The candy, tea, food, and canned goods industries should be exempt from tax. 17. Jewelry and precious stones should be reduced. 18. Pawnshops should be heavily taxed. 19. The money industry should be exempt from business tax. 20. The bundled-tax system should absolutely not be adopted when levying business tax. 21. Opinions on the special tax rate should be contributed before its promulgation to avoid harming the people. 22. The levy of business tax should be uniformly calculated based on the amount of capital.</p>
<p>Provincial Regulations: The detailed rules for the implementation of the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Collection Regulations have been filed with the Ministry and were announced yesterday. It is rumored that the collection regulations have also been revised by the Ministry, but have not yet been announced. Here are some points that have been learned: (1) Those who have been collected special tax by the central government have been deleted. (2) Those who have paid local miscellaneous taxes, such as the wine, dishes, teahouse, hotel, and entertainment venue industries, have also been excluded. (3) The tax rate for jewelry, precious stones, antiques and jade articles, which was originally 20 per thousand, is now changed to 10 per thousand. (4) The insurance industry remains at 20 per thousand. (5) The money industry is levied at 5 per thousand based on the amount of capital. (6) For business tax, if a store also operates other goods, the tax should be levied based on the main part of its business. (7) Wholesale businesses may be levied at half the tax rate. (8) When the collection agency needs to consult the store's books, it must first obtain the consent of the local chamber of commerce. (5) The tax rate is still divided into five levels, namely 1 per thousand, 2 per thousand, 5 per thousand, 10 per thousand, and 20 per thousand. However, most are 2 per thousand. As for the voluntary contribution method of Zhejiang Province, the Finance Department has not yet formally consulted with the representatives. However, the representatives are divided on whether to support or oppose this method. However, regarding the total amount of 4 million yuan, they all believe that whether it is voluntarily contributed or directly collected, it will not be easy to reach the full amount. It is said that the Finance Department estimates that the collection fees for setting up a bureau to collect the tax will also cost hundreds of thousands of yuan each year. If each county can recognize and pay the amount, it may be possible to reduce hundreds of thousands of yuan within the total amount. It is unknown how it will be handled in the future.</p>

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Ironclad Evidence of Illegal Quarrying at Tianmashan: The case of Jin, wife of Jiang Erchang of Tianmashan, Songjiang County, and stone merchants such as Cao Yunji, continuing to quarry illegally has been repeatedly opposed by local residents and Songjiang natives in Shanghai and Beijing, causing a great uproar. An instruction from the Shatian Bureau when Jiang Erchang applied for the mountain land during his lifetime has now been found, prohibiting quarrying and stipulating that it be used exclusively for Party headquarters public housing and tomb preservation. Now, they are concealing it from the official authorities and secretly quarrying, not donating to build public housing, and even destroying tombs. This is ironclad evidence of illegal mountain opening. The original text is as follows: "Jiangsu Shatian Official Property Affairs Bureau Instruction No. 12, Order to Songjinqing Shatian Branch Bureau, Presentation of a map of Jiang Erchang's application for official land such as Tianmashan for instructions, presentation of the map is fully understood. Jiang Erchang's application for land, according to the original account, is to donate to the Party headquarters for the construction of public housing and the preservation of tombs. It is hereby approved. However, this is to assist the Party headquarters in construction, a special accommodation, and shall not be taken as an example in the future. The recipient must also be notified that quarrying is not allowed. This order, map attached, July 13th, Republic of China 18, Bureau Chief Wu Qiding." Currently, 321 Songjiang natives in Shanghai, including Lei Mingjiu, have submitted a presentation to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the immediate revocation of the license, and have submitted presentations to various agencies requesting that it be permanently closed.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Notorious Bandit from Jiangyin Arrested in Wuxi: Chen Shunfa, a notorious bandit from Jiangyin, participated in the Xia Harbor riots and kidnapped Liu Zijian, a wealthy man from the township, demanding a ransom of 1,650 yuan in May and June of last year. After the case was exposed, he fled to Wuxi and hid under the Taqiao Bridge outside the South Gate. Yesterday, the Third Branch Bureau of Public Security received a secret report and Bureau Chief Wang Weixin took detectives to the address to investigate and arrest him. The bandit Chen was arrested and taken to the bureau. Chen suddenly changed his name to Zhu A'si, hoping to escape punishment, and his confession was vague. The branch bureau prepared a document to send him to the county for interrogation.</p>
<p>Department Order to Ban Huiyuan Steamboat: The Department of Construction previously received a complaint from Yan Dong Steamboat Company accusing the Huiyuan small steamboat of Hui merchants of illegally operating the Hetangqiao route. The Department immediately ordered the Wuxi County Construction Bureau to investigate and verify the matter. After investigation, the bureau found that it was indeed the case and that one license was being used for two purposes, which was inappropriate. Yesterday, they specially notified the steamboat bureau and ordered them to stop operating the Hetangqiao route within three days.</p>
<p>Opening of Agricultural Products Exhibition Hall: The county-run sericulture field, the Education Bureau, the Cooperative Enterprise Guidance Office, and the Nongsang Department's agricultural affairs investigator stationed in Wuxi office, jointly organized the county-wide agricultural products exhibition hall, which held its opening ceremony yesterday (the 26th) at 2:00 PM. Shi Guangyi of the Wuxi water police district, Gu Shuzhi, director of the Agricultural Bank branch, Zhang Renjie and Hu Nianqian of the county Party headquarters, Chen Xianke of the county library, Zhu Zuren of the Yixing Forest Farm, Xue Zilin of the Kunshan Sericulture Field, Zhou Qiwen of the Danyang Sericulture Field, Jiang Chao of the Jiangyin Rural Normal School, Hou Zhenping, representative of the Nongsang Department, and Zhang Pengyuan, along with more than 300 people, attended. County magistrate Pan Zhongjia presided over the meeting and performed the ceremony.</p>
<p>Opening of Investigation Court for Manslaughter Case: Zhou Jingxiao, a member of the Wuxi News Reporters Association, after the tragic death of his wife, Ms. Zhang Shouying, mutually accused Qian, physician, Tao Chishun and his son to the county court. On the 23rd of this month, the court summoned both parties to open the trial and ordered the lawsuit to be suspended in accordance with the law. It is now known that yesterday was the date for the opening of the investigation court, and Prosecutor Zhu summoned the plaintiff Zhou Jing to appear, the defendant Tao Chishun, the witnesses Wu Jiahe, the village security chief of the 14th district, and various doctors related to Zhang's critical situation, Zhang Zaiyang, etc. to appear in court. At 3:00 PM, Judge Zhu opened the court and interrogated Zhou, Tao Chishun, Wu Jiahe, etc. one by one, and then ordered both parties to return to await the verdict.</p>
<p>Shoe Industry Exempt from Business Tax: The Wuxi Shoe Industry Association believes that Jiangsu Province's business tax program has announced that the shoe and hat industry will be taxed at two per thousand. The association says that the shoe and hat industry is a small-scale handmade manufacturing industry, and its raw materials are nothing more than leather, straight tribute, cotton weaving, and silk, all of which have been established separately and taxed separately. If the same industry only collects the raw materials that have been heavily taxed above and then manufactures them by hand, taking a small wage, and then levies business tax, it is no different from adding a bed on top of a bed. The country has a reputation for heavy taxation, and the same industry really has no hope of survival. Therefore, yesterday, they sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce to forward to the Ministry of Finance, the provincial government, and the Department of Finance, to understand the people's livelihood and abolish the collection of business tax in order to maintain the livelihood of handmade industries.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Accelerating the Excavation of the Yunhe and Menghe Rivers: The cost of the project to excavate the Yunhe River and the Menghe River in Wujin County is around 500,000 yuan. Previously, continuous rain and snow greatly affected the progress of the project. Now that the weather is clear, the two river committees have been ordered to accelerate the excavation. All sections of the Yunhe River, except for the section from Shijizui to Guanghua Bridge, the side of the embankment numbered 21, and the area east of Yeshu Town, which are temporarily left out for merchants and drinking water, the remaining sections will be dammed, drained, and excavated immediately. The Menghe River, from Benniu Town to Xiaohe, will be completely dammed and excavated. Starting from the 26th, the two river projects are scheduled to be completed in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Two Notorious Bandits Captured in Xiguanzhuang: Xiguanzhuang Village, which connects Wujin County and Jiangyin, is a place where bandits gather. On the 24th, villagers from the Upper District, who had a long-standing feud with the bandits, went to pretend to make peace. The bandits sent two notorious bandits, Xu Genbao and Liu Hongxing, who were carrying box guns, and agreed to negotiate in Huangcun Town. Unexpectedly, the villagers of the Upper District had reported to the provincial guard team stationed at Xiaoxinqiao in advance. When the time came, the two bandits, Xu and Liu, were captured by the guard team, and two box guns and a talisman of the knife society were found. The team escorted the two criminals to the county government for interrogation on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>County Consolidation Committee Sends Personnel to Search Bookstores: The Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee Consolidation Committee, in response to a provincial order to ban reactionary publications, specially sent Zhu Tianying to various bookstores on the 24th to investigate. In the Huimin and Huicheng stores, they found "Historical Materialism and Sociology," "Outline of Social Evolution in a Week," "The Moon Breaking Through the Cloud Encirclement," "Revolutionary Biographies of Women in the World," "After Unemployment," "Two Different Kinds of Humans," "Outline of Political Economy," and several obscene novels. They immediately took the books back to the committee. If there were any reactionary remarks, they would be confiscated and destroyed. If there were no reactionary relationships, they would be returned.</p>
<p>Textile Industry Association Holds Meeting to Oppose Customs Duties: The Textile Industry Association believes that the Taixian Hai'an City Textile Industry Association Preparatory Committee has taken the liberty of levying customs duties on textile products from other ports as expenses. It has reported to the Provincial Government Construction Department and the County Party Department to transfer the matter to the province and order the Taixian County Party Department to correct the error. There are also similar cases of levying duties in Dongtai, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and other places, which hinder business. Colleagues have repeatedly requested relief from the association. The Executive Committee meeting was held on the 24th and decided that the Industry Association would only collect membership fees from association members. Non-members naturally have no reason to pay fees. The Industry and Commerce Industry Association Law has clear provisions. This illegal levy of duties will not be recognized by the association and should be immediately reported to the province to order the counties to strictly prohibit it, and notify all colleagues. The textile products have already been responsible for the cotton yarn donation, and the Finance Department's draft business tax still has the provisions for the textile industry to pay taxes, which is a kind of double levy. It should be reported to the Ministry of Finance to request that the textile industry tax be eliminated and the county chamber of commerce should be informed to transfer the report.</p>
<p>A Large Gambling Den Raided Outside the North Gate: During the current lunar New Year, gambling in the city is very prevalent. The Public Security First Branch Bureau Chief Cui Siping raided a gambling den in the Jiaotong Hotel outside the North Gate last night and arrested more than 20 people, including lodgers Huang Zuyou (small shopkeeper of Huang Wantong), Cai Laoquan, Ma Lao Si, Fang A'si, Xiao Zhonglin, and teahouse waiter Kong A'wu. Bureau Chief Cui sentenced them to fines of more than one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Robbery Cases Occur One After Another in Shazhou: Guan Qing, a resident of Lanmensha in the Third District, was kidnapped by bandits the other day and hidden in a house of a certain family in Wushan Port. A bandit was guarding him. Later, Pang took advantage of the bandit's sleepiness and escaped to report to the Zhangjiagang Water Public Security Team. The team was dispatched and four people were arrested. Chen Guoqing's house in Taiziwei was robbed the other night. Fortunately, the family had a self-defense gun to resist, and the robbery failed.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Opening of the Jiangsu Sericulture Design Conference: The Jiangsu Sericulture Design Committee Conference convened by the Jiangsu Agricultural and Mineral Resources Department opened in the Provincial Lu yesterday. Twenty-eight committee members, including Leng Yu, Zou Bingwen, etc., attended. Director He Yushu presided over the meeting and performed the ceremony. In the afternoon, the proposals were reviewed in groups. The conference continues today.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Major Fire Outside the Deficient Pass City Gate: The area outside the Deficient Pass City Gate and attached to the city is mostly inhabited by poor people such as small vendors and rickshaw pullers. Unexpectedly, at Chou hour (1-3 AM) on the 25th, a fire broke out in the home of a poor man named Chen Liangyu, and it burned along the neighbors Hu Changchun, Zhang Zhineng, Zhang Qixi, and other small households. Fortunately, they were all startled from their dreams and fled independently. Later, the fire was extinguished by the efforts of the fire department. However, the area was a scorched earth, which was a tragic sight. Local philanthropists have raised clothing, food, and reed mats for temporary relief. It is also known that the fire was caused by an argument between the Chen couple, who knocked over a fire pot. They have now fled in fear of punishment.</p>
<p>Scheduled Meeting for National Election: County Magistrate Chen Nanxuan, due to being appointed as the Election Supervisor of Jiangdu County by Hu Pu'an, the Provincial Minister and General Supervisor of the National Assembly Representative Election, ordered the promulgation of the election law, implementation law, and a schedule for various election-related matters to the county. The deadline was set for March 5th to submit the survey groups and election lists to the province. Yesterday (the 24th), a separate letter was sent to various groups, scheduling a meeting in the county on February 26th to plan the implementation, hoping they would attend at the appointed time.</p>
<p>Mistaking Starving People for Bandits at the Sanwenhe River: At dawn on the 25th, Han Wen, the captain of the First Police Company, was informed that there were a large number of bandits looting villages in the town of Sanwenhe, half a li east of the town. He immediately dispatched Zhang, the squad leader of the sub-squad, to lead armed police to the scene. However, the bandits had already left. It was learned that more than 20 starving people from other provinces, who had been transported by boat, had landed on the shore before dawn and begged for food from house to house. The villagers mistook them for bandits and reported to the city. An inspection of the losses revealed that all items were food.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Continued News of Destroying the Idols of the City God: It is reported that at around 11:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd), eight people wearing suits suddenly came to the City God Temple and destroyed all the idols. It is now learned that the people who destroyed the idols were members of the County Party Headquarters Executive and Supervisory Committee. In order to thoroughly break superstition, the committee members took this action. This morning, the committee members again brought axes and saws to cut the idols of Lord Shen, the City God, and the City God's Wife into several pieces, and hired many laborers to completely throw all the idols of the Twenty-four Departments into the river behind the temple.</p>
<p>Situation After the End of Various Industries' Accounts: The various industries in the county have now completed the closure of last year's accounts in order. Due to the rising gold prices last year, the gold industry and the five-ocean industry have made extremely large profits. Next is the oil, soy sauce, rice and flour industry, whose profits are also not small. As for industries such as money, cloth, and southern goods, due to the impact of last year's poor harvest, business was weak and there was not much profit.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Judicial Investigation into the Warden's Malfeasance at the Detention Center. Hu Xianzhou, the warden of the Nantong Civil and Criminal Detention Center, secretly harbored the singer Xiao Yuelou (also known as Jin Zhu) and misappropriated public funds. The Higher Court dispatched Yao Guozhang to Nantong to investigate. The court then declared to the Finance Bureau that future detention center expenses would be paid directly by the court. On the evening of the 24th, Judge Zhou signed arrest warrants for five detainees: Shi Ziyun, Chen Qiao, Gu Yuansui, Zhu Yongjun, and Fang Zanqingde, to inquire about the informal rules within the detention center. Public attendance was prohibited. On the 25th, Chief Prosecutor Zhu opened an investigation court to interrogate the singer Xiao Yuelou and other witnesses. Xiao Yuelou was taken back by her adoptive mother, Cheng Wangshi. Yao Guozhang received a telegram from Director Lin, instructing him to remain in Nantong temporarily to thoroughly investigate the case.</p>
<p>Complete Reorganization of the Construction Bureau. Yao Pengnian, the Director of the Construction Bureau, was dismissed and investigated by the Construction Department. Feng Baofu was appointed to replace him. Feng took office on the 25th and announced the appointment of 25 staff members, including Zhang Ruhong. All redundant staff, numbering over 30, were dismissed.</p>
<p>Defeat of Pirates at Da'an Port. The 3rd Battalion of Liang's troops, in conjunction with the Water Police, routed the pirates at Da'an Port, on the border of Tonghai. The pirate ships have scattered and fled.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Rejection of Fishing Tax Suspension. The Jiaxing County Government, considering the extreme hardship of the fishing households, deemed the collection of fishing tax to be excessively harsh. Therefore, at the 20th County Administrative Meeting, a resolution was passed to petition for the suspension of the tax and to request that the collected taxes from previous years be allocated for warehouse construction expenses. The Civil Affairs and Finance Departments have jointly issued an order to the county, stating that the requested suspension of the fishing tax cannot be approved and instructing the remittance of the collected fishing tax to the national treasury.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob Two Villages in Succession. In Houzhuang Village, about five li outside the North Gate of the city, over ten bandits speaking with accents from Jiangbei and Henan suddenly broke into the home of Ji Hu Guilian Wang's house late the other night, armed with guns. They stole six bolts of Huasi silk and over ten silver dollars. The owner, Guilian, was injured by the bandits. The bandits then went to the homes of Fei Caifa, Shao Jinfa, Shao Heshang, and Ye Changshou, residents near Gutou, and committed large-scale robberies. Fortunately, the villagers heard the alarm, sounded gongs, and shouted together, causing the bandits to fire several shots and flee north.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Construction Department Reforms Navigation Administration Methods. Shi Ying, the Director of the Construction Department, after the Provincial Navigation Bureau was merged into divisions and the district sub-bureaus were restored as ship management offices, drafted six reform measures to improve navigation administration. The measures are as follows: (1) More personnel should be dispatched to various docks to inspect and determine the passenger capacity of each ship, avoiding overcrowding to prevent danger. (2) The horsepower of each ship should be limited to no more than 40 horsepower. (3) Each ship should carry a maximum of six towboats. If there are too many passengers, additional trips should be added. (4) Each ship should add men's restrooms for the convenience of passengers. (5) When a ship is about to set sail, it must be inspected by personnel from the office before it can depart. (6) Various forms should be created and distributed to the ships for posting.</p>
<p>Implementation of Joint Defense on the Border of Five Provinces. Previously, the Zhejiang Provincial Government frequently reported border police issues, stemming from bandits being driven from one province to another. Neighboring provinces did not cooperate or communicate, making it impossible to eliminate them permanently. Therefore, joint suppression measures were drafted, stipulating that if a county on the border of two provinces encounters a bandit alarm, troops should be dispatched jointly, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries, without hesitation. These measures were sent to Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces to solicit their agreement. Each province has separately replied, expressing their agreement and requesting a copy of the measures for proper compliance. Chairman Zhang has already sent the sealed measures.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Head of the Anti-Rebel Corps Sent to the Bureau for Investigation. On the 22nd, a young traveler arrived at Room 30 of the Jiaotong Hostel on the north bank of Jiangbei in Ningbo. Dressed in military uniform, he claimed to be Chen Ying, the head of the 2nd Regiment of the Provisional 1st Brigade of the 22nd Division of the Anti-Rebel Army. Yesterday (the 23rd) at 1:00 PM, the traveler suddenly asked the bellboy to send a letter to the 2nd Precinct of the 2nd Sub-Bureau on the north bank of Jiangbei. The letter vaguely stated, "This regiment received 5,000 yuan in pay from Kaifeng and is going to Wufu with two battalions and five companies of soldiers to Yuzhou. Please send a police officer to protect them for three days." Director Yang of the precinct, considering the wording of the letter and the seal on it to be suspicious, invited the adjutant of the 2nd Battalion of the Bao Hong Team to the hostel to question the traveler. The traveler's answers were evasive, and over ten pawn tickets were found. Director Yang and others, considering the traveler's story to be incoherent and likely impersonating a military officer, took the traveler to the precinct and sent a written report to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Quarrel Between Husband and Wife Leads to Death by Drowning of Uncle and Nephew. In the Wu family of Yizihetou, Zhenhai, lived Jin Ahua, a 30-year-old émigré from Huangyan. He was formerly a soldier but is now unemployed and quarreled with his wife, Xie. Yesterday (the 23rd) afternoon, they quarreled again, and his wife, in a fit of anger, jumped into the Liancao River. Seeing his wife fall into the river, Ahua hurriedly jumped in to rescue her. At that moment, Ahua's maternal uncle, Fa, seeing the situation, also jumped into the river to help. Unexpectedly, because of the continuous rain and snow in the Lian River, the river was very full, resulting in the drowning of both uncle and nephew. Xie was rescued by onlookers and fortunately did not lose her life.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Arrest of Self-Government Committee Member Following Exposure. Wang Yanchen, a former self-government committee member in Songxia, was reported to the County Government Public Security Bureau for smoking opium and running gambling dens.

<p>The Zhejiang Education Department recently stated that, with the commencement of political tutelage, elementary school education is of utmost importance. To promote the development of elementary school education, the first step is to reorganize elementary school teachers. Since the merger of middle schools and normal schools in 1923, the number of normal school graduates in the province has been small. Currently, nineteen out of ten people working in elementary school education have not received normal school training. Although many of them are excellent talents with educational knowledge and experience, they are limited by their qualifications and cannot fully utilize their strengths. Moreover, unqualified teachers are employed to fill the ranks, while efforts are made to screen and eliminate them, which goes against the state's intention to ensure the efficiency of national education. Furthermore, since 1927, matters related to elementary school education in the province have not been resolved, and the source of normal school graduates is as described above. The difficulty currently felt by those administering local education, apart from funding, is the scarcity of teachers. Although the registration of elementary school teachers separately conducted in the province last year in May was an emergency measure to reorganize elementary school teachers, the results were still difficult to achieve the effect of screening and reorganizing. The Education Department believes that the certification of elementary school teachers is a matter that urgently needs to be addressed. The other day, it specially submitted a document to the Ministry of Education, petitioning for the prompt promulgation of regulations for the certification of elementary school teachers, so that they can be followed and implemented.</p>

<h3>Establishment of Fahua Middle School in Fahua District</h3>
<p>Yang Yongxing and other administrative committee members of the Fahua District in western Shanghai believe that the district is close to the concessions, densely populated, and has a growing number of young students. However, the district only has elementary schools, and many poor students are forced to discontinue their education due to lack of funds to attend higher schools. As a result, many students are unable to receive further education. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately establish a middle school, provide comprehensive facilities, and reduce tuition fees, so that local students can continue their education. Therefore, Mr. Yang invited local residents the other day to discuss the implementation plans. As a result, it was decided that the school would be built on public land such as the Jiji Warehouse and Fahua Temple in Fahua Town, and the funds would be raised from the land and the district office. Everything is generally in place. The name has also been decided as Fahua Middle School. Priority will be given to local students, and the remaining places will be open to others. It has also been decided to start preparations immediately, in the hope of establishing the school as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Shandong Prepares for the North China Games</h3>
<p>▲ Drafting the General Outline of the Organizing Committee</p>
<p>▲ Expanding the Stadium Construction</p>
<p>▲ Opening Tennis and Baseball Fields</p>
<p>▲ Hiring Registered Preliminary Contest Personnel</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The 15th North China Games have been decided to be held in Jinan this year. The province has established the Shandong Organizing Committee for the 15th North China Games, responsible for handling the affairs. This afternoon (the 23rd) at 4:00 PM, the committee held its first meeting at the Public Sports Field outside Nanweimen. Committee members He Siyuan, Zhang Yue, Zhang Weicun, Zhang Hongjian, Zhang Honglie, and Wang Xiang attended. Attendees included Yang Peng, a clerk from the Department of Education, Pi Songyun, the head of the Third Section, Zhang Hongwen, the director of the Jinan Municipal Engineering Bureau, Zhang Yixian, the director of the Sports Field, and Tong Jinbiao, the instructor of the Sports Field. He Siyuan chaired the meeting, and Yang Peng took the minutes. The meeting began with a report from the chairman, stating that the 15th North China Games would be held in Shandong this year, with participants from twelve provinces and three municipalities. As the host, Shandong should prepare thoroughly. The previous games were held in Nanjing, with Nanjing's budget reaching 300,000 yuan. Shandong should pay attention to this. As the deadline approaches, preparations for the games and funding must be made in advance. Then, discussions began: (1) Regarding the organization of the North China Games, it was decided to have Committee Member He Siyuan draft a general outline for review. (2) Regarding the stadium, the chairman first asked Zhang Yixian, the director of the Public Sports Field, to explain the layout of the field. The 12th Games were held in Shandong at the Public Sports Field, which covers 54 mu. It was felt that the terrain was unfavorable, being lower in the northwest and higher in the southeast. The straight track, which is 220 meters long, was also considered insufficient. The 12th Games had 40 participating groups, and this time, the number of participating groups would double. The facilities within the field are inadequate. The viewing stands for the 12th Games were made of straw mats, which was uneconomical. This year's games must be prepared thoroughly, and the venue is also the location for Jinan's public sports activities, so it is even more appropriate to make long-term plans. (A) Leveling the terrain. (B) Extending the straight track to 270-280 meters and reducing the angle of the 400-meter circular track. (C) Constructing viewing stands to accommodate 15,000 people, with three people per two meters. (D) Constructing a viewing stand in the middle of the east side of the straight track for officials and important guests. (E) Adding buildings for storing sports equipment and for use as offices. (F) Opening tennis, baseball, and team ball fields on the newly purchased 11 mu of land (east of the existing venue) for this year's games and future use. (G) Constructing a shelter from wind and rain, for future use. (H) Digging wells. It was decided to construct viewing stands for 30,000 people, and other construction matters would be handled jointly by the Construction Department, the Engineering Bureau, and the Sports Field. They would begin surveying and measuring tomorrow and then design and estimate the costs, aiming to complete everything before the games begin. (3) Regarding the funding of the games, it was decided that the committees would prepare budgets and submit them to the provincial government for discussion. The funding for the games would be submitted to the central government, and letters would be sent to various provinces and municipalities in North China for donations. (4) Regarding sports talent, it was decided that the organizing committee would register officials for track and field events and hire sports experts from Beijing to serve. The meeting adjourned. It is reported that the Provincial Public Sports Field is located outside Nanweimen, at the foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain. West from Nanweimen, there is a main road leading to Thousand Buddha Mountain. East from Xinxinzhen and Nanweimen, there is a main road leading to Kaiyuan Temple. The original field covers 54 mu, is long from north to south, and narrow from east to west. The office buildings are located in the northeast corner of the field. West of the building is the tennis court. In front of the gate is the first basketball court, and south of that are the second and third basketball courts. West of these is the track, with the field events area in the middle (used for both soccer and football). The newly purchased 11 mu of land to the east of the field will be used to open tennis, baseball, and team ball fields. A shelter from wind and rain will be built in the northwest corner, and wells will be dug. Once completed, it will be a magnificent sight. It is also reported that Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu ordered the Municipal Engineering Bureau to repair the roads leading to Thousand Buddha Mountain and Kaiyuan Temple before the games so that athletes from various provinces could visit the scenic spots. This is also a noteworthy part of the preparations for the North China Games.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Guangzhou - Li Qingduo</h3>
<p>Guangdong is the cradle of revolution, occupying an important position historically and geographically. In the past, when Minister Sun Zhe Sheng served as the director of the Guangzhou Municipal Government, he spared no effort in reorganizing the municipal administration, demolishing city walls to build roads, and dedicating himself to construction. Guangzhou was thus able to take on a new look. I have not returned to my ancestral home in Guangdong for nearly a decade. So, in January, I took the time to return south for a visit. Although I only stayed for two weeks, there was much to see in the City of Five Rams that is worth mentioning. I will record them here in a miscellaneous fashion.</p>
<p>▲ Narrow Lanes Become Wide Roads: In recent years, the Guangzhou authorities have actively paved roads throughout the city. Narrow streets have also been gradually demolished and rebuilt into roads, making transportation convenient. The number of cars in the city has increased compared to the past. Small electric ferries have also been installed from Guangzhou City to Henan for crossing the river. This is one of the new constructions in recent years. However, many of the street names in the city, especially those along the new Guanma Road, have been changed. After being away for so long, I often couldn't recognize the roads. There is a sense that the people are the same, but the city is different.</p>
<p>▲ Scenic Yuexiu Mountain: Yuexiu Mountain was originally called Guanyin Mountain, located in the northeast corner of Guangzhou. In the past, when Long Jiguang governed Guangdong, he occupied it as his stronghold, hiding here. He built many fortresses on the mountain, looking down on everything from a commanding height. Now, this mountain has been developed into Yuexiu Park and renovated. The abandoned fortresses have been demolished. Visitors cannot help but feel a sense of the past and present. The Zhenhai Tower stands on the peak of the mountain. In recent years, Mayor Lin Yunge renovated the tower and turned it into a museum. He invited Legislative Yuan President Hu Zhantang and former Executive Yuan President Tan Zu'an to write couplets on it. The tower has five floors. Climbing to the top, one can see for miles and have a panoramic view of the Pearl River.</p>
<p>▲ Eastern Suburb Busy with Officials: The eastern suburb is located east of Guangzhou, facing the Pearl River and backed by Baiyun and Yuexiu Mountains. The scenery is beautiful. Guangdong Provincial Chairman Chen Mingshu, Eighth Route Army Commander Chen Jitang, and Guangdong Finance Director Fan Qiwu all chose to reside here. Every day, the streets are bustling with officials and cars. The military and police provide very tight security. Recently, the Eastern Suburb Model District has been developed. Construction of houses is underway. Gu Xiangqin, the Secretary-General of the National Government, has also purchased a house in the district, planning to retire here in the future. Although Guangzhou is large, most people love the eastern suburb, viewing it as a paradise.</p>
<p>▲ Decline of the Dongdi Flower District: In the past, the flower district of Guangzhou was most lively in Dongdi. Brothels, pleasure boats, and flower boats gathered here. Now, due to the frequent impact of the current situation and military disturbances, the flower industry has suffered a great blow. The restaurants in the Dongdi area have all closed, and the brothels have also moved elsewhere. All the pleasure boats and flower boats have sailed away and moored along the Changdi area. As the saying goes, "extreme prosperity leads to decline," is it not true?</p>
<p>▲ Listening to Opera in the Park: To the right of the Provincial Government is the First Park. The area is quite large, and the layout is elegant and clean. Flowers and trees are planted in abundance. The park is equipped with wireless telephones. All operas broadcast by wireless radio from various places can be heard. There is also a wireless broadcasting station that broadcasts Cantonese opera several times a day. Many Cantonese people like Cantonese opera. After dusk, many people come to the park to listen quietly. The weather in Guangdong is warmer, so even in winter, the number of visitors does not decrease. Because admission to the park is free, and you can listen to songs, many citizens enjoy going there.</p>
<p>▲ Frequent Aircraft Training: The Aviation Department is located in Dashatou, Guangzhou. The department has an aviation school with more than a hundred students. They practice flying every day, regardless of the weather. They fly in the air with one, two, three, or four planes. I once visited Deng Yueming, the captain of the Second Air Force Squadron, and he showed me around the aviation department. The internal facilities are quite complete. The development of the aviation industry in Guangdong is boundless. Deng also recounted the experience of leading the Second Air Force Squadron on the Northern Expedition last autumn. He showed me a large sword captured from Feng Yuxiang's large sword team, saying that it was a good souvenir for their squadron.</p>
<h3>Record of a Small Ornament Exhibition - Sun Choucheng</h3>
<p>Zhou Shaofu from Baitazi Lane, Suzhou, is nearly sixty years old and good at carving. He has a unique and unrestrained personality. He spent thirty years and tens of thousands of yuan hand-making various small ornaments, categorizing them meticulously. He stored them in his home for his amusement. This time, at the urging of friends, he was invited to display all the small ornaments in the hall for public viewing. To prevent noise, each visitor is charged twenty cents to cover the expenses of the caretakers. (1) Three square tables are arranged in rows, displaying items used in weddings. The two lamps are only five inches tall and have the red characters "Dun Hou Tang Zhou" on them. Behind the lamps are two five-inch square red wooden tables, displaying various musical instruments such as suonas, trumpets, huqins, and strings, each only an inch long. In the main hall, everything is prepared, including chairs, teacups, and spittoons. In the bridal chamber, there is a bed about a foot long, made of mahogany, with complete bedding and curtains. Next to it are cabinets, chests, tables, and chamber pots, all smaller than an inch, but identical to the real thing. (2) A small boat is made using two high stools, representing a funeral scene. The boat is nine feet long, similar in style to the double-decked Wuxi fast boats. At the bow of the boat is a tall white archway, with the four characters "Niu Mian Bu Di" inlaid in the middle. In the front cabin is an altar with a four-inch wide and six-inch long statue of a god and a three-inch wide and four-inch high memorial tablet with a portrait of Shaofu. The tablet bears Shaofu's titles. He is still alive but does not avoid taboos, showing his open-mindedness. In the middle cabin is a coffin about eight inches long. Next to it are two wooden puppets of women, weeping by the coffin. (3) A house is built using wooden planks, about two feet high, as a model of the Zhou family ancestral hall. The entrance has wooden fences. Plaques are erected on both sides, and there are two tiger head plaques, only an inch or so in size, with the eight characters "Ancestral Hall, No Entry" written on them in red ink. Stone lions stand facing each other. A plaque hangs high above the door, creating a grand atmosphere similar to that of a Qing Dynasty yamen. (4) Three board houses are built, about five feet wide. The middle one is the longevity hall, with longevity couplets and banners hanging on all four walls. Although they are only eight or nine inches long, all the texts were specially written by famous people. The left one is the accounting room, with a mahogany accounting table about three inches high, with books, writing brushes, inkstones, abacus, and teacups on it, exquisitely crafted. The right one is the reception hall, with tables and chairs arranged like the real thing. The tea stand under the sign is equipped with everything. Everything is meticulously crafted. The Ming-style lanterns are more than an inch in diameter, with hanging tassels. (5) The kitchen is made of lead sheet, and the stove is also made of bricks, only three inches high. It also has four pots. Bamboo cabinets, water tanks, coal stoves, and other miscellaneous items are arranged on the left and right. Knives and meat blocks, everything is complete. Other items include the "Ten Thousand People Umbrella," the "Virtuous Governance Plaque," and the theatrical performances installed on the platforms. Curtains hang from the windows of the eight sedan chairs. Everything used for weddings, funerals, and celebrations, and the miscellaneous items needed for daily life are all available. To create objects so richly is rare in the world, so I am happy to record it.</p>
<h3>Table Talk by the Wine - Qiulang</h3>
<p>Last evening, a friend invited me to a banquet at his residence. Those at the table were all old acquaintances, and some brought their wives. The dishes were extremely rich. The host also urged us to drink diligently, so the whole table was joyful. Then someone suggested playing a drinking game, saying that social banquets often use drinking games to help the atmosphere, but this is noisy and intrusive, with little pleasure to be said. Tonight, we can tell a story or a joke to serve as a drinking game, but it must be interesting above all. Everyone agreed. Thus, everyone used their clever tongues, and laughter arose. I will choose the witty ones to record here to amuse you.</p>
<p>▲ Returning to Suzhou and Hangzhou: Friend A said, "There is a saying, 'Above there is heaven, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou.' This is because Suzhou and Hangzhou have beautiful scenery, a mild climate, and abundant products, all of which are enough to arouse the envy of people from other places. Even more so, people from the northern provinces of Yan and Ji yearn for this famous paradise. In fact, those of us who grow up here do not feel any particular pleasure. It is said that when relatives or friends in the north pass away, the plain scrolls they send, with the gold characters written on them, often use the four characters 'Return to Suzhou and Hangzhou' and hang them in the courtyard. This has the same meaning as 'Return to Penglai Island' or 'Return to Yaochi' used by southerners. However, the yearning of people there for Suzhou and Hangzhou can be seen here."</p>
<p>▲ God-Given Rice Flour: Ten days ago, the weather was cold and freezing. Six-petaled snowflakes fluttered about, and the jade buildings and towers suddenly became a silver world. Those who wear fur coats and sit around the fireplace are three feet deep in the snow and do not know the cold. But the poor scholars and poor households who seek warmth and food day and night, because of the heavy snowfall, cannot go out to work and lament in their homes. It is truly pitiful. A friend at the table said, "It is said that in the past, when the weather was cold and the year was ending, Heaven, pitying those who were poor and had nothing to spend the year, flew down rice flour. Each household would sweep the flour in front of their doors and use it to survive the year. Later, because people were cunning and greedy, they snatched from each other and even caused deaths. Thus, what fell was snow instead of flour." Although the story is absurd and baseless, it is interesting.</p>
<h3>Tune: Huanxi Sha - Xuange</h3>
<p>▲ Returning Home Late from White Cloud Tower</p>
<p>The lamps resemble dense stars, the moon a jade scepter. My homesickness seems to be level with the white clouds. Where can I entrust my longing in this layered tower? I have poured tea and wine repeatedly, but I am already old. I have thrown gold coins secretly, but my wishes are hard to fulfill. When will I plant beans and return home with a hoe?</p>
<h3>Two Poems on Plum Blossoms - Shuqin</h3>
<p>Dark clouds cover the earth, jade dust flies in the sky. It is the winter vacation. I am deeply happy to have plum blossoms as companions. Therefore, I compose these poems.</p>
<p>A pure heart and simple nature reveal innocence. The scenery on the ridge is especially divine. The plum is willing to bring white snow to the green mountains. But the recluse Lin Bu has passed away; who else remains?</p>
<p>A secluded affection is difficult to reconcile with vulgarity. In a clear dream, I see her radiant, slender form on jade steps. I often linger within the sparse shadows. In the vast expanse of white stones, whom am I waiting for?</p>
<h3>A Loyal Dog's Tragic Death During Antarctic Exploration - Zhi Zheng</h3>
<p>Major Byrd of the United States, along with more than fifty team members, went to Antarctica for exploration in the winter of 1928 and achieved great success, adding a remarkable feat to the scientific community. The details of the team's exploration were translated and published by Zhi Zheng in Travel Magazine (Volumes 5, Issues 1 to 4). Major Byrd loved a sled dog most in his life and named him Alasca. They were inseparable. During the Antarctic expedition, Byrd assigned him to be the leader of the sled dog team, and he was unparalleled in loyalty and bravery. When Byrd returned to his country, the dog also became famous. Unfortunately, on the road in Monroe, Louisiana, he was crushed to death by a car. Those who heard of it mourned deeply. Byrd was especially saddened. He was buried a few days ago. The funeral was attended by more than two thousand officials, students, boy scouts, and civilians. It was truly an unprecedented event, and it shows how much foreigners value those who contribute to science.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (375) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: The Art of Preserving Youthful Beauty Mingles with Eyebrow Makeup, Continuing the Endless Search for Thoroughbreds in the Golden Market</p>
<p>In reality, China doesn't need the newest types of weaponry. When two enemies fight, if the opponent uses a certain weapon, we should use the same one. This is like meeting a knife with a knife, a spear with a spear. China's enemies now are also using those old weapons. So, if we are just slightly better than them, that is enough. Even for those old weapons, we still have to ask for them from abroad. That is a very sad thing for China. Because Ye Tonghou was very well-known in Shanghai and could speak some basic English, the Pacific Trading Company hired him as a Chinese manager. Most of his friends were also revolutionaries. Any arms deals were conducted secretly through him. He socialized a lot and had wide connections. As a result, almost everyone in the northern brothels of Shanghai knew about "Third Young Master Ye." Today he came and asked Hua Yuanchun, "Old Six, I heard you're going to Beijing?" Hua Yuanchun said, "How did you know? That's really fast information! Who told you?" Ye Tonghou said, "I knew a long time ago. I always pay attention to current events. When are you leaving?" Hua Yuanchun said, "The day after tomorrow night. I've never been to Beijing before. I don't know if I'll get used to living there. I heard it's very cold." Ye Tonghou said, "Although the weather is a bit colder than Shanghai, it doesn't matter. Because the houses in the north all have stoves. I actually think the climate in Beijing is better than in the south. The kind of humidity and the rainy season in the south doesn't exist in the north. And there are many sunny days. Once, I lived in Beijing for three months. It hardly rained at all. I'm going to Beijing again soon. Maybe I'll leave next week. Hua Yuanchun was worried that she wouldn't be able to find familiar clients in Beijing. Also, Third Young Master Ye was generous to the women in the brothels, and their relationship wasn't bad. So she said, "Third Young Master, are you really coming to Beijing? Then you must come to see me! You can just ask at Qing Yu Tang. If I'm not working, I'll be staying at the Central Hotel or other hotels. I'm afraid I'll have no one to rely on in Beijing. If you come, I'll treat you like family." Ye Tonghou said, "You're saying that now. Once you get to Beijing and make a few good clients, you won't care about us old friends anymore." Hua Yuanchun said, "Third Young Master, since you say we're old friends, you should know my, Hua Old Six's, personality. Of course, people who work in brothels always want to make some money. But I'm not someone who only cares about money. If I only cared about money, I wouldn't be so poor that I have to find ways to get even a small amount of money. Old friends are always old friends. If you say that, it doesn't sound like we're old friends." Ye Tonghou laughed, "I was just joking. Why are you getting so worked up? I'll definitely come to see you in Beijing." As he spoke, he tugged at her sleeve and said, "Let me talk to you for a moment."</p>

<h3>Converting the Confucius Temple into a Park</h3>
<p>▲ Preserving the historical site of the Confucius Temple</p>
<p>▲ The San Sen Company wins the bid</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government decided to renovate the Confucius Temple and convert it into a park for citizens to relax, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works was ordered to plan the first phase of the renovation project and invite bids for construction on a scheduled basis. Yesterday (the 26th) at 2:00 PM, the bids were opened. The Municipal Government sent a special representative to the bureau to supervise. The plans for the Confucius Temple renovation and the results of the bidding are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Renovation Plan for the Confucius Temple The Confucius Temple is located on a very large site, bordered by Confucius Temple Road to the south, Xuegong Street to the east, Menghualou Street to the north, and Laodaoqing Street to the west, covering an area of approximately thirty-two acres. As the Confucius Temple is one of the historical sites in the city and the halls have been in disrepair for many years, the Bureau of Public Works has decided that those with historical value will be preserved as they are. The Dacheng Hall, Chongsheng Temple, Minglun Hall, and Kuixing Pavilion are all to be preserved. The Jukui Hall will be converted into a music hall. At the main gate and second gate of the Confucius Temple, a library will be built. The river at the Dacheng Gate will be filled in for twenty-four meters (approximately eight zhang). The original stone bridge will be removed and rebuilt about six feet to the north. The corridors on both sides of the Dashi Hall will also be removed and replaced with passages for planting trees. The school site of Minglun Primary School will be preserved as is. Because the Pan Pool floods every year during the two flood seasons, the water overflows into the classrooms of Minglun Primary School, the Pan Pool will be dredged at the time of reconstruction to prevent future flooding. The drainage ditch in Confucius Temple Road is currently under construction. The facilities in the park will be built in phases.</p>
<p>▲ Results of Yesterday's Bidding Yesterday was the day for the Bureau of Public Works to open the bids. Around 2:00 PM, representatives from the Municipal Government arrived at the bureau to supervise. The bidders also arrived one after another. The winning bidder was the San Sen Construction Company, with a bid of 9,946.60 yuan. Wang Yuxing and Zhu Senji, among others, were not selected because their bids were too high, one being over 16,700 yuan and the other being over 14,900 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Requests the Withdrawal of Foreign Soldiers from the Outer Road</h3>
<p>▲ Letter to the French Consul General</p>
<p>The Municipal Government sent a letter to the French Consul General in Shanghai, Koklin, yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, We have received your letter stating that the case of French sailors injuring citizen Ding Jiaxun and others at Tianyao Bridge has been settled peacefully. This government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and confirm the facts. However, the matter of stationing troops in the outer road was not mentioned. The area where the sailors are stationed is within the city limits and they are undisciplined, causing repeated incidents. We have repeatedly asked your office to punish the perpetrators and provide compensation, but you have not said a word about withdrawing the sailors. This government feels deeply regretful about this. Since the sailors have repeatedly committed violence and the relationship with the local residents has deteriorated, who will be responsible if other incidents occur? We request that your Consul General consider the friendship between our countries and take measures to quickly withdraw the sailors and ensure that they will not be stationed there again in the future, in order to clarify national rights. We hope that you will investigate the aforementioned case and reply."</p>
<h3>Dispute Between New and Old Stewards on the Gonghe Steamer</h3>
<p>▲ Many old stewards were injured in the assault.</p>
<p>▲ The comprador, Shen Huating, was detained.</p>
<p>▲ The perpetrators will be handed over to the court today.</p>
<p>The Gonghe Steamer, which runs between Shanghai and Hankou under Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., experienced a dispute because the newly appointed comprador demanded a security deposit from the old stewards without success. He also recruited new stewards to replace them, but to no avail. The new stewards assaulted the old stewards with weapons in Wuhu the day before yesterday, injuring many. The steamer arrived in port yesterday at 1:00 PM. The details of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Existing Stewards The Gonghe Steamer of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. operates on the Shanghai-Hankou route and docks at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou, Shanghai. When the previous comprador, Gao Wenbin, took over, he brought thirty-eight stewards, each of whom was charged a security deposit by Gao. There were three types: 300 yuan for the first-class cabin, 180 yuan for the cabin, and 140 yuan for the third-class cabin. However, there were also eighty old stewards on the steamer, all of whom were members of the China Seamen's Union. They had never paid a security deposit under previous compradores, so Gao continued the practice and did not ask. Everyone got along well until Gao transferred his position to Shen Huating.</p>
<p>▲ Refusal to Pay Security Deposit The new comprador, Shen, had previously served as a comprador on the Wanliu Steamer on the Fujian route, the Dongting Steamer on the Shanghai-Hankou route, and the Jiangtian Steamer on the Hankou route under the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Later, the Wanliu Steamer's business deteriorated and the authorities ordered it to cease operations. The Dongting Steamer also encountered danger and sank mid-route. Shen lost both positions one after another, but he continued to work on the Jiangtian Steamer. Shen then sought the position of comprador on the Gonghe Steamer. Coincidentally, the comprador of the steamer, Gao Wenbin, intended to resign, and they quickly reached an agreement. After Gao resigned, it was agreed that Shen would be responsible for the security deposits of the thirty-eight stewards Gao had previously collected. After taking over, Shen saw that there were eighty old stewards and believed that they should also pay a security deposit to be fair. However, the eighty stewards insisted that there had been no such requirement under previous compradores and firmly refused.</p>
<p>▲ Forcing the Surrender of Licenses Shen, unable to get his way, recruited forty new stewards and charged each of them a security deposit: 400 yuan for the first-class cabin, 300 yuan for the cabin, and 200 yuan for the third-class cabin. The new stewards prepared to board the steamer and take over, but the old stewards refused to step down, preventing the new stewards from working. They could only sit and sleep on the steamer, and their meals were provided by Shen. Seeing that this could not continue, on the evening of the 19th of this month, the steamer docked in Shanghai. Shen hired several strong men to board the steamer and force the old stewards to surrender their licenses. Yuan Dequan, the first-class cabin leader, refused and was slapped twice by Shen. Seeing that things were not going well, the old stewards also hired several people to board the steamer and protest. Shen seized the opportunity to escape. That night, all the new stewards packed up and went ashore. The next day (the 20th), the steamer set sail for Hankou as scheduled. Unexpectedly, the new stewards were waiting in Wuhu, ready to fight.</p>
<p>▲ A Brutal Assault Earlier, the new stewards and others left the steamer and, led by Shen, boarded another steamer to Wuhu. They also hired dozens of thugs, each wearing a badge. The new stewards each had two round black rubber plasters on their temples, and three others wore white cloth knots on their chests for identification. They prepared a large number of iron tools and waited for orders. At 4:45 AM on the day before yesterday (the 25th), the steamer arrived in Wuhu. Led by Shen, the new stewards swarmed aboard and dragged the old stewards off the steamer without asking any questions. Many stewards were sleeping and were dragged out of bed and beaten. The entire steamer was in chaos. More than twenty old stewards were dragged to the Wuhu wharf and beaten. Those who were not dragged away were brutally beaten on the steamer. Many third-class passengers were also affected.</p>
<p>▲ Details of the Injuries Cui Wanxi, an old steward, had his head broken by an iron ruler and bled profusely, suffering serious injuries. Yang Guisheng, Wu Zhilian, and others were also beaten by the new stewards. Yang and Wu were left in Wuhu for treatment due to their serious injuries, while Cui Wanxi was taken back to Shanghai on the steamer and sent to Renji Hospital yesterday for treatment. The whereabouts of the other stewards who were dragged to Wuhu are unknown. It is not known where they are, or if they were injured. Ding Rongchang, another old steward, was hung up and handcuffed in the cabin for two days and nights. He was finally rescued yesterday when the steamer arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Crew Members Evacuate During the fight, the crew members, fearing that they would be affected, fled to their cabins and locked the doors, not daring to come out. The shipowner, Kang Bier, originally planned to sound the alarm and ask the British soldiers from nearby warships to come and stop the fighting, but the comprador, Shen, dissuaded him, saying that it was just a matter of expelling the old stewards and there was no need for foreign soldiers to interfere. After the fighting, the old stewards who had not been dragged away did not dare to go to the main cabin, fearing that they would be beaten again. They took refuge in the cargo hold and engine room. Their duties were performed by the new stewards who boarded the steamer in Wuhu.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram for Help When the Gonghe Steamer arrived in Nanjing on the 25th, the injured old stewards secretly went ashore and sent a telegram to Shanghai, reporting to the union that more than twenty colleagues had been beaten and taken away in Wuhu and their whereabouts were unknown. They asked the union to provide assistance. Upon receiving the telegram, the union reported to the Shanghai Water and Land Police Bureau, asking them to arrest the perpetrators when the steamer arrived.</p>
<p>▲ Comprador Detained The steamer stayed in Wuhu for two hours and then sailed to Nanjing. Shen disembarked at Xiaguan and took a train back to Shanghai. However, the Shanghai Seamen's Union had already received the report and sent people to wait at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station. Shen was spotted by union members on the night train and reported to the railway police, who arrested him. It was reported that Shen was carrying a handgun, which was also seized by the police. Both the person and the gun were temporarily held at the railway station, pending transfer to the local court for disposition.</p>
<p>▲ Perpetrators Arrested At 1:20 PM yesterday, the steamer arrived in port. The Water Police Bureau had received a letter from the Seamen's Union in the morning, requesting the arrest of the culprits. The captain ordered West Detective Pang Shi, Chinese Detectives Cheng Yongnian, Huang Zhenlin, Deng Jiageng, Hu Changqing, Wu Rongsheng, and Huang Songsheng to lead more than twenty Chinese and foreign armed police officers to board small boats and guard the steamer to prevent the culprits from escaping. At the same time, the Public Concession Police also sent several armed detectives to assist. After the steamer docked, the Water Police Bureau officers boarded the steamer and conducted a thorough search. They found three iron bars, three axes, two knives, two iron chains, and more than twenty iron rods in the new stewards' quarters. They then encountered Hu Hanzhang, the leader of the new stewards, and interrogated him. His face turned pale. He claimed to be the steamer's purser and was going to see the passengers, but the old stewards recognized him and reported him to the detectives. He was immediately detained, along with Ding Yongchang, the leader of the old stewards, and taken back to the police station. The weapons used in the assault were also taken to the police station for safekeeping.</p>
<p>▲ Transfer to Court The captain first conducted a preliminary hearing for the two. According to Ding, he was the leader of the old stewards and described the entire incident in detail. He claimed that when the fight broke out, he hid in the mailman's coat closet, but Shen spotted him and dragged him out. Shen ordered his men to cut off his foot with an axe, but they were persuaded to stop. He was then imprisoned in a room. According to Hu Hanzhang, he was from Anhui and had gone to Anqing on business. He returned to Wuhu and asked when the Shanghai steamer would arrive. He was told that the Gonghe Steamer would pass by on the morning of the 25th, so he boarded the steamer to return to Shanghai. He denied being the leader of the new stewards and claimed to know nothing about the new stewards' assault. The captain ordered them to be detained, pending transfer of the defendants and weapons to the local court today for questioning.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Finance Bureau Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>▲ Reporting on the Latest Developments in Major Businesses The Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, Tang Naikang, will host a reception for journalists at the Municipal Government's Leisure Club at 6:00 PM on March 3rd to report on the latest developments in the bureau's major businesses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Holds Budget Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Passing the Levy of Agricultural Fees for Autonomous Funding</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has recently received an order from the Provincial Government to submit the budget for the 20th year. County Magistrate Yan convened a budget meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, gathering more than ten people from various county agencies, including the heads of various bureaus, district chiefs, the head of the property management office, and the county agricultural station. County Magistrate Yan, as the chairman, began by reporting that the county's local funding was insufficient. The county agricultural station had no funding and had to borrow from the county's internal affairs funds in the 19th year's budget, which made it difficult to carry out county affairs. Therefore, it was proposed to request approval from the Provincial Government to levy an additional five percent on the busy season tax to be used as agricultural improvement funds. The funding for each district was also insufficient, and the autonomous affairs were heavy. It was proposed to levy an additional amount from the deed and tooth tax, similar to the construction donation, starting from the 20th year to be used for district purposes. The Finance Bureau then presented the prepared draft budget, which was discussed item by item by the attendees. It was resolved to pass the proposal as is. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Cancellation of the Railway Traffic Surtax</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, The collection of the traffic surtax on the Jinghu and Huhang railways originated during the time of Sun Chuanfang in Jiangsu. After the National Government settled the Southeast, this surtax was explicitly abolished by the Ministry. Not long after, it was reinstated in the name of reorganizing traffic. Over the years, we have observed that public opinion is that passenger and freight fares on the Jinghang railways have already increased compared to the past. If, in addition to the official increase, a surtax is created, it seems to contradict the purpose of facilitating public transportation. This is the first point. The tracks and vehicles of the Jinghang railways have been damaged by military operations, which is different from the situation on the Longhai and Jinpu railways. The so-called reorganization of traffic seems to be unfounded. Moreover, these two railways are located in the important areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and their business is booming, with annual surpluses. Even if the Ministry has plans for reorganization and expansion, it is the duty of the state-owned railways to take from the business surplus and not add to the burden of passengers. This is the second point. In addition to the passenger tickets being collected at a progressive rate of two percent, freight transport is charged at seven percent. Traditionally, shipping is cheaper than rail transport. Since the abolition of the customs posts, the obstacles to water transport have also been removed. However, the railway traffic surtax still exists, which is equivalent to leaving a mutated kind of internal revenue tax. This increasingly causes commercial freight to shift to water transport. This is detrimental to the government's new policy of abolishing internal revenue taxes and hinders the railways from undertaking freight transport services. This is the third point. Based on the reasons listed above, it is absolutely necessary to abolish this traffic surtax immediately. We hereby submit this information to the Ministry for your review and approval. Please consider public opinion and order the two railway bureaus to stop collecting the traffic surtax from today onwards for the sake of public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows."</p>

<h3>The People's Livelihood Research Association Holds Its Fourth Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Discussing Workers' Welfare Issues Today</p>
<p>The People's Livelihood Improvement Research Association continued its fourth meeting yesterday to discuss modern industrial problems. More than sixty representatives from various regions attended, divided into two sessions in the morning and afternoon. Li Peien was the chairman and Zhang Shizhang was the recorder. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Agenda Items In the morning: (A) Wang Yunwu proposed that, based on the world trend and China's needs, it is necessary to adopt large-scale industries. However, the preconditions are (1) organizational issues, (2) labor-capital issues, and (3) solutions. For the first issue, scientific management methods must be used. However, the Chinese people have misunderstandings about scientific management and are afraid that after implementation, there will be overproduction and unemployment problems. In fact, the cause of unemployment in Europe and America is not the result of using scientific management. For example, the unemployment problem in Germany is due to the loss of territory and the reduction of the military, not the fault of scientific management. Scientific management can make workers' compensation sufficient and treatment fair. For the second issue, a profit-sharing system can be used to allow the labor side to share the surplus of the industry, so that labor and capital can cooperate. For the third method, factory meetings should be adopted, and labor and capital should jointly seek work and business improvements. Only after the implementation of the above three methods can China's large-scale industry have hope. After Wang finished speaking, Chen Qitian raised various difficulties in the implementation of these three methods in the West, which seemed unable to completely solve the labor-capital problem. In the afternoon, Deng Yuzhi proposed: (1) Why do female workers account for the majority in large factories? (2) How should the daily working hours of up to twelve hours be improved? (3) How should the poor living conditions of workers be improved? (4) How should the lack of education and entertainment for workers be improved? (5) The wage difference between child labor and adult labor is too large, so many factories use child labor. (6) Female workers are unable to take care of their children due to work. (7) The solution to various problems still lies in government power, national laws, and labor unions and other methods.</p>
<p>▲ Reports (1) Deng Yuzhi reported on the Huigong business of the Wuxi Silk Factory and the problem of women and child labor in large industries. (2) Sun Miaoyun reported on the working conditions of female workers in the silk factories: (A) The current dormitories for female workers in the yarn factories are too poor. (B) Union leaders are too ignorant and often use the union for their own selfish purposes. (C) Female worker education should be promoted. (D) The night work of spinning factories should be improved. (E) There should be breaks during shift changes.</p>
<p>▲ Discussion Items (1) What kind of business can attract public attention is what we hope for. (2) In which aspects should experimentation or training be applied? (3) In terms of industrial development, what kind of business has the Chinese Church done to protect the old ethical conditions or new ethical conditions? What can their churches and social reformers do for the workers to make the trend of industrial development affected by them?</p>
<p>▲ Today's Agenda This morning, discuss the relationship between worker welfare business and government labor policy. This afternoon, discuss the relationship between worker welfare business and labor groups. The address is 23 Yuanmingyuan Road. Zhong Ketuo will give a public lecture on the Christian Church movement and people's livelihood issues. The time is 7:30 PM, and the address is the YMCA on Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>The New Police Chief of the Two Railways Took Office Yesterday</h3>

Then, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lai Weiying, the Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Command, Liu Chun, Wu Mai, and others gave speeches, generally saying that Police Chief Deng had a deep historical connection with the Party in the past and that he would definitely be able to fulfill his duties satisfactorily. After the speeches, Deng gave a reply. They then took a photo together on the open space of the North Station before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Yesterday’s Re-election of the Party Doctrine Research Association of the Local Court</h3>

<h3>Shanghai County Held a Rural Pacification Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held a rural pacification meeting in the county government auditorium at 2:00 PM yesterday. County Magistrate Yan chaired the meeting. The results of the meeting were not released due to the sensitive nature of bandit suppression. It was only learned that the first step of the rural pacification plan is to start with propaganda, followed by a period from March 3rd to April 11th for checking household registrations and compiling door numbers. From April 11th to April 21st, inspections of ships will be conducted to prevent bandits from infiltrating. As for mutual guarantee, a system of joint responsibility for five households is planned, but it is subject to provincial approval due to the complexity of the procedures.</p>
<h3>The Roads Association Sends Representatives to the American Road Builders' Association Convention</h3>
<p>▲Report by Ye Keliang</p>
<p>The China National Roads Construction Association previously received an invitation from the American Road Builders' Association Convention to send representatives to attend. Association President Wang Zhengting telegraphed Ye Keliang, the Consul General in Chicago, to represent the association. Yesterday, the association received a reply from Consul General Ye, reporting on the convention and sending over 40 types of road administration documents and English speech drafts. These will be published in the Roads Monthly. The letter is transcribed below: "Dear Sir, I was previously instructed by Minister Wang via telegram to represent the Association at the American Road Builders' Association Convention, which I have attended. I am sending a copy of my English speech.

<h3>Negotiations Regarding the Autopsy of Zhang Wenyi’s Corpse</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenyi, the garrison battalion commander of the Wusong Fortress Command, was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment due to a ruptured blood vessel in his nose. He passed away in the hospital at 10:35 AM on the 20th of this month. His younger brother, Zhang Wenyu, special affairs chief Wang Wumu of the garrison battalion, and clerk Ji Xuzhong were present to care for him. The body was moved to the morgue. The next day, his family members went to the hospital for inspection and were shocked to discover a knife wound running from the neck to the lower right leg, which had been stitched up.</p>
<h3>Photographing Zhang Wenyi’s Corpse After Dissection</h3>
<p>It was clear that the hospital had secretly dissected the body. Zhang Wenyu reported the situation to Commander Deng of the Fortress Command, who sent Deputy Adjutant Shen to the hospital for negotiation. The hospital director, Dr. Bader (transliteration), received him and provided a written explanation of the dissection. After Deputy Adjutant Shen returned to report, Commander Deng reported the facts to the Ministry of Military Administration and sent a letter to Baolong Hospital to question them. Yesterday, the ministry sent personnel to the hospital to transport Zhang's body back to the Wusong Fortress, where it will be coffined and buried after Zhang's father arrives in Song. Negotiations with the hospital are underway.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Labor Strikes at Two Factories</h3>
<p>▲Arbitration Ruling at Tianzhang Factory</p>
<p>A labor strike occurred at the Pudong factory of Tianzhang Paper Company due to workers demanding year-end bonuses and the reinstatement of workers Zhao Yaojin and Chen Qichang. The Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation committee three times, but no resolution was reached due to the company's insistence. According to the Labor Dispute Resolution Law, the mediation was declared unsuccessful, and the city government was asked to apply for arbitration. All workers, because the company did not comply with the government's advice, had no choice but to go on strike from the 9th to awaken the company and request assistance from all sectors. The municipal government, to avoid expanding the labor strike, convened an arbitration committee on the 20th for arbitration. The chairman was Guo [name missing], and the committee members were Hou Dachun, Yu Zhong, Zuo De [name missing],</p>
<p>Zhao Zhenyao, and Chen Liangyu, with Chen Tianzhou as the recorder. The workers were immediately ordered to resume work and await arbitration. All workers complied and resumed work. The arbitration committee ruled that (1) the factory should pay a year-end bonus equivalent to ten days' wages to each worker; (2) no wages will be paid for the strike period; (3) workers Zhao Yaojin and Chen Qichang should be reinstated, and their wages should be reduced by half during the suspension period.</p>
<p>▲Mediation Success at Ruirong Factory</p>
<p>The British-owned Ruirong Iron Factory on Yangshupu Road employs over 300 male workers. The labor-management relationship has been harmonious. In March of last year, the Social Affairs Bureau and both parties signed labor-management conditions regarding treatment issues. Later, due to poor business, the factory adjusted the shifts of the original workers. The labor side had no objection, because this was stipulated in the conditions. Recently, business has improved, but the factory has not restored the original system. On the 24th, the labor side sent representatives to demand a restoration, but the new foreman, Mr. Smith, refused, leading to a work slowdown by all workers on the 25th. The factory then requested the Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to mediate. The bureau sent section member Gu Bingyuan to persuade them, and both parties agreed on three resolutions: (1) The factory acknowledges that everything will be handled in accordance with the labor-management conditions, but before the conditions expire on March 12th, no further shift adjustments may be made; (2) Starting today, the factory should restore the non-shift adjustment</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>system; (3) All workers will resume work today, and wages will not be deducted for the work slowdown period. All workers resumed work that afternoon.</p>
<h3>Jiang-Zhejiang Postal Service Requests Modified Registration Regulations</h3>
<p>▲Private Postal Services Still Allowed to Deliver Inland Letters</p>
<p>Yin Yuantong and other representatives of the Jiang-Zhejiang Postal Service Association submitted a document to the National Government, stating that the revised registration regulations are still difficult to comply with, and requesting modifications based on previous regulations to maintain the people's livelihood. The document stated that it is difficult to comply with the regulations regarding private postal services delivering inland letters, and requested modified registration regulations to maintain the people's livelihood. The Ministry of Communications approved the request, stating, "Having received your submission, we have instructed the Postal Administration to revise Article 5 of the regulations for private postal services obtaining registration certificates. You should apply for registration certificates in accordance with the regulations." This approval was based on the Postal Administration's revised Article 5, which stated that all letters collected by private postal services must be sealed in total packages and delivered to the post office for delivery. However, if the place of origin or destination does not have a post office or mailbox, or cannot be reached by village postmen, the private postal service may temporarily deliver the letters themselves. However, if there are two or more post offices along the way, and the private postal service also has branches or agents there, the letters should still be delivered through the post office. The private postal service should provide a list of the locations of its offices and agents to the local post office for record-keeping. Thus, inland letters must still be delivered through the post office. The so-called revision is no different from no revision. Private postal services are mostly established in urban areas or famous towns, and all urban areas or famous towns have post offices or mailboxes. Therefore, all inland letters must be delivered through the post office, and private postal services will have no livelihood. As for the statement that private postal services may temporarily deliver letters themselves if the place of origin or destination does not have a post office or mailbox, or cannot be reached by village postmen, it is argued that the destination may be a remote village without a post office or beyond the reach of postmen, but the place of origin must be a major trading port or a town with a post office or mailbox. It is almost impossible for both the place of origin and destination to have no post office. Therefore, the so-called permission to deliver letters themselves is only in name and not in practice, and will inevitably force all private postal services to close down. It is recalled that when the postal service was first established, inland letters collected by the post office were delivered by private postal services without any charge. Overseas letters collected by private postal services were sealed in total packages and delivered to the post office, with postage paid. The post office and private postal services were closely linked, and foreign and inland transportation was convenient. Private postal services were actually auxiliary to the post office. For decades, private postal services have been allowed to deliver inland letters themselves for this reason. The situation in China is different from that in other countries. In other countries, cities and villages have telegraphs, telephones, trains, and cars, and transportation is convenient. Postal delivery is unimpeded, and commerce and public sentiment are not hindered. Private postal services have no foothold. China has a vast territory, and villages are numerous. Telegraphs and telephones have not been widely installed, and trains and cars have not reached the entire country. The delivery of inland letters relies entirely on human labor. Once private postal services cease operations, it will inevitably obstruct inland commerce and information, paralyze the market, and prevent letters from reaching remote villages. Commerce and public sentiment will be hampered, and the livelihoods of over 100,000 poor people in the postal service industry will be pitiful. After careful consideration, the representatives unanimously agreed to request the government to take into account the situation and allow private postal services to continue to deliver inland letters themselves according to previous regulations. In the future, as transportation develops and postal delivery is unimpeded, merchants and the public will voluntarily use the post office, and private postal services will be naturally eliminated. This will benefit both commerce and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we dare to submit this request to your government for review and approval."</p>
<h3>The Chinese Marine Engineers Association Reorganizes Its Affairs</h3>
<p>The Chinese Marine Engineers Association in this port is organized by Chinese nationals who serve as marine engineers on ships. It has been established for over six terms and has been working hard to recover navigation rights and expand the scope of service for Chinese nationals. In recent years, due to a lack of leadership, association affairs have been neglected and members have dispersed. The association's chairman, Xu Linxun, and others recently convened a meeting of all members to discuss reorganization methods. It was agreed to raise basic funds and hire Mr. Song Linhua as assistant, among other important matters. A declaration was also issued (declaration omitted).</p>
<h3>Rent Dispute at Shoufu Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession</h3>
<p>▲Tenants Petition Various Agencies for Assistance</p>
<p>The tenants of Shoufu Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, submitted documents to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Committee, and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating, "We are petitioning because the landlord is arbitrarily increasing rent and demanding the signing of illegal lease contracts that are extremely harsh and unacceptable. We request that you take measures to stop this to benefit the people's livelihood. The tenants have been living and doing business in the houses in Shoufu Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, for over eight years. The landlord was initially Nongcheng Company. In November of the 12th year of the Republic of China, the property was sold to a Wu surname, a compradore of Hua Bi Bank. The lease matters were entrusted to Yipin Bank. At that time, the rent was increased once. It was also increased once in January of last year. Therefore, the current rent is not only low compared to the rent in the neighborhood, but it is also several yuan higher. However, on January 10th of this year, we suddenly received a notice from Yong'an Real Estate Company, stating that the lease matters had been transferred to the company for management and that all tenants must sign a lease contract, otherwise they would be deemed to have waived their rights and would be required to vacate the premises. The tenants contacted the company, but the company re-established the rent, calculated monthly in silver, and increased the original rent by a significant amount. A lease contract must also be signed. Upon reviewing the contents of the contract, it is extremely harsh (the lease contract is attached for review). If we agree, the tenants will have almost no place to live. Moreover, at a time when commerce is declining and the people's livelihood is difficult, repeated rent increases are unbearable. We have repeatedly sent letters through representatives, but the company has ignored them. On February 20th, they sent letters to all tenants, demanding that they sign the contract within one week and implement the rent increase. All tenants are very panicked. We believe that such a harsh contract is rare in the city. Moreover, the tenants have been paying rent monthly without incident. When Yipin Bank managed the lease previously, there were no</p>
<p>[illegible words] This time, the company took over the management and immediately took this initiative, increasing the rent significantly, treating the tenants as fish to be slaughtered, hoping to extract a large income. If this is not stopped, I am afraid that landlords throughout the city will follow suit, having a great impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. We have always admired your care for the people's livelihood and your empathy. For this illegal and harsh lease contract and the overreach of forcibly increasing rent, we beg you to provide assistance and stop it to benefit the people's livelihood and reduce the burden. This will be a great benefit," February 26th.</p>
<h3>Bai Luofei Still Plans to Fly to the Philippines</h3>
<p>After returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong aboard the President Grant, Bai Luofei, the pilot of the Meixin Foreign Firm, said to reporters yesterday that the trip was hindered by bad weather, but he has not abandoned his plan to fly to the Philippines. This trip back to Shanghai is because there are other important matters that need to be discussed with Meixin's manager [name missing]. It has no connection with the flight to Manila. He plans to return to Hong Kong on Monday aboard the North German Company's cargo ship Havel. If that ship is inconvenient, he will take the President Van Buren, which leaves next week. Once the weather is good, he will fly from Hong Kong to Manila.</p>

<h3>Cotton Weaving Industry Decides to Increase Dyeing Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Light Cotton Weaving Industry Association convened a meeting of dye factory operators yesterday afternoon, attended by over 20 representatives. The chairman, Zhu Wenqi, reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the prices of all raw materials in the industry, such as caustic soda, sulfuric acid, and dyes, have been rising continuously. Although the price was increased by 1.5 liang last month, it is not enough to cover the cost. Therefore, it was legally decided that from March 1st, regardless of new or old set lines, all dyeing, starting from the original light, will be increased by 1.5 liang to maintain the cost, and the dyeing prices will be announced to all customers.</p>
<h3>Continued Records of the Jisheng Association's Shaanxi Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association is currently organizing relief efforts in Shaanxi, with the Chang'an branch joining forces with various Chinese and foreign charitable organizations. The disaster situation in the Hanzhong area of southern Shaanxi is particularly severe and transportation is inconvenient. Relief efforts were not carried out there last year. The branch has raised 10,000 yuan to distribute to eight counties, including Lueyang and Hanyin. The association has chosen a severely affected area and donated 10,000 yuan specifically to relieve one county, as reported previously. Yesterday, the association received a telegram from She Guisheng, the director of the Tianjin relief office, stating that Zhu Ziqiao and Lou Xiangqing, along with Rao Pingqing of the Xiaohui Xueshe, had completed their relief work in Qian County, Shaanxi. Because the victims in Liquan County are calling for help and the disaster situation is extremely tragic, Zhu and Lou plan to raise 20,000 yuan to entrust to Rao for investigation and relief and requested the association to contribute funds for joint relief. The situation was urgent and a telegram was sent to request instructions. Zhu Ziqiao and Lou Xiangqing also telegraphed with the same reason. Because Liquan County in Shaanxi was relieved last year, and the use of money was not cheap, this County disaster still strange heavy, the Association could not bear to wait and have continued to allocate relief funds, a total of 10,000 yuan, combined into 30,000 yuan, remitted to the joint venture, its Shaanxi Wugong County, the Association has run two places for disaster children shelters, now plans to change to run vocational training, has sent the funding for January, February, March and April and also transfer to Jinliyuan Wharf Xiexincheng warehouse to be used by Zili Jun to rush to Shaanxi to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Discussions on the Shanghai Municipal Council Purchasing the Da Hua Hotel Property</h3>
<p>▲Harriss Will Submit to the Ratepayers' Meeting</p>
<p>Since Harriss of the Yongming Life Insurance Company proposed that the Shanghai Municipal Council purchase the Dahua Hotel property as the new site for the Municipal Hall and the Municipal Council, the number of supporters has been increasing daily. The Women's Federation of this port unanimously resolved the night before last to ask the Municipal Council to submit the proposal to the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting. Other Western organizations are also considering the proposal. Most of them support it. It is expected that a resolution will be reached within one or two weeks. Yesterday, it was heard that Harriss, in view of the good atmosphere in all sectors, formally submitted the original letter to the Municipal Council the day before yesterday, requesting careful consideration. According to Harriss, if the Municipal Council does not intend to submit this proposal to the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, he will also rally comrades to propose it according to the rules. As for the value of the Municipal Council's existing properties and the Dahua property, it is estimated by people in the real estate industry that the difference is not far off. Dahua covers 26 mu and is worth 4.25 million taels. The Municipal Council's current site occupies 24.5 mu and can be valued at 3.84 million taels. However, Harriss's original proposal was to issue bonds first to purchase the Dahua property, and then sell the Municipal Council's existing buildings at a good price in the future when land prices increase.</p>
<h3>Cheng Yongxi Accused of Communist Suspicion</h3>
<p>▲Previous Punishment Revoked Due to Lack of Evidence</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, the Special Court's Criminal Court Held a Trial</p>
<p>In December of last year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered that Cheng Yongxi, a Western doctor from Anhui residing in Yimin Lane, Baike Road, was suspected of being a communist. Detectives were dispatched along with the police to detain Cheng and send him to the Special Zone Local Court. After a preliminary hearing, Cheng was ordered to be taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further interrogation. After hearing the verdict, Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated that according to the agreement to recover the Mixed Court, any case to be transferred must be transferred after the court investigates and clarifies the evidence. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has not presented evidence to prove it, so he expressed his disagreement and filed an objection. The collegial panel, with Judge Xu, ruled on the 9th of this month that the original punishment was revoked, and the case should be investigated and punished again. Cheng was then returned to the police custody and has been there for three weeks. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Cheng to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau still sent personnel to present a document requesting the transfer. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the previous situation. Judge Wu Tingqi declared to the defendant that the Public Security Bureau stated that he was suspected of being a communist in Guangzhou in the 16th year of the Republic of China. He asked Cheng whether he had any explanation. Cheng replied that in the first half of the 16th year, he practiced medicine in Shanghai. Because business was bad, he followed Zhang Fakui's army as a military doctor in the second half of the year. He moved the army back to Guangzhou from Wuchang. (Q) Who was the chief military doctor? (A) Shi Yi. (Q) How many military doctors were there? (A) More than ten. (Q) Was Luo Haifeng also a military doctor? (A) I don't remember. (Q) Were you in Guangzhou at the end of the 16th year when the communists were causing trouble? (A) Yes. (Q) What was the situation at that time? (A) I only saw chaos. I also closed the door and dared not look out, and I often heard gunshots. (Q) Which army was firing? (A) Initially, Zhang Fakui's army returned to Guangzhou and then went to Dongxiang. Later, I heard that Guangzhou was surrounded and opened fire with the communist army. I also avoided it at that time. (Q) At that time, were you working with Luo Haifeng in the Red Army Hospital? (A) No. (Q) Was the Red Army a part of Zhang Fakui's army? (A) Yes, but I later entered the Medical Section of the Health Bureau, and the director was Shi Yi. Judge Wu stated that it was necessary to investigate the case further and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody for a continued trial at a later date. The defendant's lawyer requested bail, which was</p>
<p>rejected.</p>

<h3>Various Savings Shops' Resolution Methods</h3>
<p>▲Most still allow withdrawals as usual</p>
<p>Due to an order from the Ministry of Finance, relayed by the Municipal Government, to ban shops from concurrently operating savings businesses, the Bureau of Social Affairs issued a notice to all shops engaged in savings, giving them one month to cease operations. The resolutions made by various companies yesterday regarding this matter are detailed below:</p>
<p>▲Underwear Company: China Underwear Company had already notified its depositors to suspend deposits and withdrawals. Starting yesterday, it has been clearing accounts according to banking procedures for one month. Payments will begin on March 25th. It is reported that the company plans to repay all current account deposits in ten installments, once a month, based on the deposit amount. For fixed-term deposits, depositors may convert their deposits into shares, or another method will be decided. However, the details of the disposal are still under discussion.</p>
<p>▲Central-Western and Central-French Pharmacies: Due to differences in internal organization, Central-Western Pharmacy will temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals while awaiting a resolution. Central-French Pharmacy will still allow withdrawals. However, no interest will be paid on deposits not yet due. All gifts and discount coupons will be invalidated. If withdrawals are made upon maturity, all debts will be honored as before.</p>

<h3>Municipal Hygiene Testing Laboratory Offers Free Rabies Vaccine Injections</h3>
<p>▲And Free Smallpox Vaccinations</p>

Those bitten should immediately go to the laboratory to receive the injections, free of charge. However, they must adhere to the laboratory's instructions and not interrupt the injections for them to be effective. Previously, these injections were very expensive. The laboratory's initiative to provide free injections is truly beneficial to the citizens. Fresh vaccine is also being used for smallpox vaccinations. Both are available daily from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Rockefeller Foundation Denies Hospital Donation</h3>
<p>The Yulin News reported yesterday, citing a February 25th dispatch from Beijing, that on February 24th, the Japanese United News Agency reported that the Rockefeller Foundation would donate 2 million yuan to build a jointly-operated Sino-American hospital in Shanghai.

<h3>Match Stock Must Be Prepared for Transport and Sale</h3>
<p>▲Tobacco Dealers Resolved Yesterday</p>
<p>The Bureau of Unified Taxation has ordered all distributors of matches in the city to register their stock with the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Taxation Bureau on Weihaiwei Road by the 28th of this month and obtain a certificate for immediate transport and sale. This news caused panic among tobacco dealers, as they have the widest distribution network for both wholesale and retail sales and therefore the largest inventory. However, their sales have been established for a long time and cannot be pre-determined, making the situation significantly different. The trade association specially sent representatives to petition but were unsuccessful. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the members gathered at the Shanghai South Office to re-discuss the outbound transport policy. Director Qian expressed his opinion that although the association had already issued notices regarding match stock, he feared that members had not fully paid attention and were not aware. As the petition had been ineffective and re-issuing notices was impossible due to the imminent deadline, he urged all attendees to fulfill their obligations and verbally notify their counterparts to prepare for outbound transport and sale to avoid misunderstandings and tax penalties during inspections. This was unanimously approved. Next, Gaochang Temple Xieji Sheng reported on a request to reduce the tax on light tobacco and alcohol licenses. It was resolved to appoint Qian Wenda and Qiu Tanglin to contact the tax office and handle the matter. Finally, the meeting discussed the regulation of trade practices and labor-management cooperation for mutual development and livelihood, adjourning after 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Twelve Trade Associations Use Ning-Shao Wharf as a Transit Route</h3>

They have now reached an agreement to allow the use of the wharf as a transit route. Each of the twelve trade associations will pay an annual rent of 3,000 yuan for the wharf. Therefore, the trade associations discussed the method of apportioning the rent yesterday and notified their members that they can now use the Ning-Shao Wharf as a transit route for loading and unloading goods, benefiting commercial transport.</p>

<h3>New Police Chief Appointed to the District Court</h3>
<p>Following the death of Yang Deshan, the police chief of the Shanghai District Court, all court police officers jointly requested that Chief Prosecutor Liu Maochu promote police inspector Chen Xihui to fill the vacancy. However, Mr. Liu believed that although the position of police inspector was one rank below police chief, the inspector's workload was even heavier and should not be neglected due to the promotion. Therefore, he ordered Chen Xihui to remain in his original position. As for the police chief position, Mr. Liu found that Xu Jinqing, currently a detective at the Garrison Headquarters, was previously a court police inspector and was naturally familiar with the work. Therefore, he ordered Xu Jinqing to be appointed as police chief. Xu Jinqing has resigned from his position as a detective at the Garrison Headquarters and reported for duty yesterday.</p>

Cai Saqiao was elected as the temporary chairman. After everyone expressed their opinions, it was generally agreed that yarn prices have increased sharply and various raw materials have skyrocketed recently. The sales prices of various factories are difficult to fix, so temporary standard prices must be set to meet market needs. After public discussion, the following temporary prices were set: 42-count long men's socks with ribbed cuffs: 2 liang and 6 qian to 2 liang and 5 qian; 40-count long men's socks with plain cuffs: 2 liang and 8 qian and 5 fen; 60-count long men's socks with plain cuffs and soles: 3 liang and 6 qian to 3 liang and 5 qian; those with cushioned soles will add 1 qian; 60-count single-strand long men's socks with plain cuffs and cushioned soles: 3 liang and 3 qian and 5 fen to 3 liang and 5 qian.</p>

<h3>Ancient Coffin and Ancient Coins Unearthed on Zhuhuo Three Roads</h3>
<p>▲Workers Unearth While Burying Electrical Cables</p>
<p>▲Believed to be from the Shouyuan Period</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that yesterday, workers from the Shanghai Telephone Company unearthed six coffins, three ancient coins, and four earthenware jars while burying electrical cables at the intersection of Zhubao San Road on the Bund. The workers opened two of the coffins, finding only some withered bones. However, the coffins were still intact and sturdy, taking a long time to open with axes. The remaining four coffins were spared from being opened due to the arrival of the patrol. According to eyewitnesses, the coffins were likely from the Song and Yuan dynasties, buried over 600 years ago. Unfortunately, the ancient coins had already been taken away by the workers, making it impossible to verify. It is believed that the area was once the site of tombs of gentry and wealthy families. Over the years, the descendants declined, and the area was eventually turned into a road.</p>
<h3>A Case of Suspected Enticement and Rape with Incoherent Foster Daughter</h3>
<p>▲Claims to have been raped and abandoned in the wilderness</p>
<p>▲Severely scolds Xiao Sizi for lacking conscience</p>
<p>▲Xie Xiao Sizi is suspected and sent to court</p>
<p>▲Still no results after confronting each other</p>
<p>Zhou Jin Di, a 16-year-old foster daughter of Zhang Hong Cai from Jiangbei, works at the Yufeng Cotton Mill in Yangshupu and lives in the mill's No. 7 workshop. She suddenly disappeared at 7:00 PM last month. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, she was found wandering on the side of the road at the intersection of Datong Road and Gonghe Road in Zhabei. Those who saw and questioned her were met with silence, appearing mentally ill. A patrol officer spotted her and took her to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. When questioned by the officer, she remained silent. She was temporarily detained pending family recognition. Zhang Hong Cai learned of the incident and went to the bureau to identify her, confirming that she was his missing foster daughter. However, he did not know why she had lost consciousness. He sent her to the nearby Baoshan Road Hospital, where the doctor gave her medicine and injected her head. Her mind cleared slightly, and she mumbled to herself, but she still could not return to her original state. When asked about what had happened, she could not answer many questions. Later, she suddenly said sternly that Xiao Sizi had raped her and abandoned her in the wilderness, and that he lacked conscience. She then claimed that she had been raped by a young man for several nights, with an old man sitting by and witnessing it. Her remaining words were mostly incoherent. Zhang noticed that the gold earrings on her ears and the velvet shirt she was wearing were missing. Hearing her words, he suspected that she had been raped, so he asked the doctor to examine her private parts, which were indeed not intact. With no clues, it was difficult to ask the officials to investigate. He took Jin Di back, but she remained as dull as a wooden chicken, staying in the workshop without speaking or smiling. The wife of Xie Changhai, a fellow villager of hers, also works at Yufeng and lives next door to Jin Di. One afternoon, Xie visited the workshop to see his wife. Zhang suddenly remembered that Xie was also named Xiao Sizi. Before Jin Di disappeared, Xie would always visit his wife on Sundays. After this incident, he had not come for a long time. Xie was strongly suspected. Zhang reported him when he finally saw Xie yesterday, and he was sent to the Special District Local Court by the relevant police station this morning. Judge Xiao conducted a preliminary hearing. Zhang stated the previous circumstances, but Xie denied everything. When Jin Di was questioned, she only provided her name, age, and origin, and said nothing else. The court ordered Xie to stand in front of Jin Di and asked if he was the rapist, but Jin Di only glanced at him slightly, turned her head away, and gave no indication of whether it was him or not, yielding no results. Xie was detained for the time being, pending a forensic examination to determine what illness she had and whether she was a virgin, before further questioning and verification.</p>
<h3>New Sassoon Sues Tenants Case Debate Period</h3>
<p>▲Three Groups of Tenants Interrogated</p>
<p>▲Debate to Open on the 23rd of Next Month</p>
<p>▲Saulmon is a Real Estate Manager</p>
<p>▲Has Been Certified by the British Consulate</p>
<p>The case of 164 tenants in Qingyun Lane, North Sichuan Road, being sued by British merchant New Sassoon Company for rent arrears, requesting a judgment for compensation and ordering all tenants to move out, has been heard by Judge Zhou Daren of the Special District Local Court. The defendants were divided into four groups to be interrogated to avoid crowding. On the 23rd, the first group of 41 households was interrogated. After clarifying the fact of rent arrears, a court date was set for the 23rd of next month for debate, as reported in the newspapers. On the morning of the 24th, the second group was interrogated. The plaintiff's lawyer, Huppert, submitted a letter from Davis, the manager of the company, in response to the defense lawyer Xue Jiaqi's objection to the qualification of British citizen Saulmon, who represented New Sassoon Company in the lawsuit, on the day of the preliminary hearing. The letter proved that Saulmon was indeed the manager of the New Sassoon Real Estate Department and had the right to represent the company in the lawsuit. However, lawyer Xue still attacked the letter, saying that there was no way to verify whether the letter was signed by Davis, and its authenticity was questionable. According to the Civil Procedure Law, private certificates should be proven by the person presenting the evidence. Judge Zhou then instructed the plaintiff's lawyer to order Davis to appear in court next time to prove Saulmon's position. He then clarified the facts of rent arrears of each household and also instructed that the cases be debated together on the 23rd of next month. On the morning of the 25th, the third group was heard, but Davis still did not appear in court that day. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, he was suffering from illness. Judge Zhou asked each defendant who appeared in court about the amount they owed. The debate date was also set for March 23rd. Yesterday, Wu summoned the last group. The plaintiff's lawyer first explained that Davis's illness, according to the doctor, required him to rest quietly and that it was difficult for him to appear in court. The letter proving Saulmon's qualification has now been certified by the British Consul, which should be credible. He then submitted the letter. Judge Zhou then questioned the defendants who appeared in court and instructed that a unified decision be made after the conclusion of the debate on the morning of March 23rd. Lawyer Xue then requested that a larger courtroom be selected when the time came, as all tenants wanted to be in court.</p>
<h3>Suicide Out of Frustration from Lack of Schooling</h3>
<p>▲Pitiful Wang Ruqin Died for Her Ambition</p>
<p>Wang Jingquan, the director of the North Henan-Shandong Gunpowder Mine Refining Factory of the Ministry of Military Affairs, resides on Tauffeurs Road in the French Concession. His eldest daughter, Ruqin, is 22 years old and attends the second grade of the high school department of Jinan University in Zhenru. Recently, due to her eagerness to learn, she was eager to advance in grade. Without graduating from high school, she planned to apply for a university undergraduate course. In the middle of this month, she managed to obtain a high school diploma and went to Daxia University on Zhongshan Road to register for the examination. However, the diploma became a problem, and she was not accepted. Ruqin was ashamed and frustrated, and her depression was evident. Her father learned of this situation and, in addition to earnestly persuading her, asked a friend to help her enroll in a law and politics college to fulfill his daughter's original intention of pursuing education. However, this matter was not settled until the day before yesterday, and Ruqin, unable to wait, suddenly had a pessimistic thought and hanged herself in her bedroom that evening. This morning, her father was about to inform his daughter of the good news. However, after knocking on the door for a long time, there was no sound. He tried to pry open the door and saw his daughter hanging high, already dead. At that time, he reported the matter to the French police for collection, but the police said that the matter involved human life and had to be examined. Therefore, the body remained there for a day, and had not yet been put in a coffin last night.</p>
<h3>Tang Lanzhen Discovers Two Husbands</h3>
<p>▲Zhou Hongtao and Zhang Meiting</p>
<p>Zhou Shengquan, a 42-year-old from Songjiang, lives in Sanzhao, Nanhui, Pudong. His son, Hongtao, is 20 years old. Eight years ago, Zhou hired a matchmaker to betroth Tang Lanzhen from the same village to his son as a daughter-in-law. Lanzhen and Hongtao were raised as foster children at that time. It was recently decided that they would marry in the spring of this year. Unexpectedly, in August of the year before last, Lanzhen's mother, Gong, died of illness. She returned home to handle the funeral and never returned. Although Zhou searched everywhere, he could find no news. Now that the wedding date was approaching, he was very anxious. Later, according to a tip from a friend, Lanzhen had become involved with Zhang Meiting, a garment worker from Pudong, and was cohabiting at No. 48 Jianyu Lane, Haichao Temple South Street, outside Xiaonanmen. Zhou was furious and immediately led Hongtao to find Lanzhen yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM. He then reported to Miao Dian, the guard of the 25th station in the area, and took her back to the third station of the first district for preliminary hearing. According to Lanzhen, she had married Zhang Meiting as his wife two years ago through a matchmaker named Wang A'gen, based on her own decision. She claimed that she did not know the Zhou father and son. They were separately detained pending investigation before further verification.</p>

<p>Incoming Correspondence Regarding Several Points of View on the Implementation of the Factory Act by Chen Zongcheng</p>
<p>The National Government has promulgated the Factory Act, which is now officially ordered to be implemented on August 1st of this year. From the perspective of the International Labour Office, this is truly something to congratulate the National Government on, and to celebrate and comfort our country's society. As for the implementation of the Factory Act, there should be no further delays, and the government naturally has appropriate arrangements for the subsequent steps and preparations for the implementation of the Factory Act. In my opinion, the following are the points that we urgently need to pay attention to at present: (1) Training and protection of factory inspectors, (2) Standardization of the implementation of the Factory Act in various factories in the country, (3) Labor and management organizations should do their best to assist the government in the implementation of the Factory Act. The above three points are briefly explained as follows: (1) A complete inspection system is indeed the most important condition for the successful implementation of the Factory Act. The National Government, in view of this, has already promulgated the Factory Inspection Law, but there are still several practical problems that are worthy of our attention. A. The training of inspectors seems to require many experienced people to actively guide practical training, and special training should be added for specialized issues such as preventing machine hazards and improving factory hygiene. Suitable inspectors are actually the most difficult to obtain. B. The selection and appointment of inspectors must be strict, but the number does not necessarily need to be large, because the number of factories in our country with more than 3,000 people is still small. Looking at Japan's 1925 factory inspection report, Japan had 300 inspectors, and 27,000 factories were subject to the Factory Act. 47,000 factory inspections were conducted that year. Japan's factory inspection experience can be very useful for our reference. C. The position of the inspector must have considerable protection, so that they can perform their duties without fear of slander. Inspectors must receive a relatively high salary, so that they are economically independent and not tempted by profit. The duties and environment of inspectors are very special, so the above points should be noted. (2) The Factory Act should be uniform for both Chinese and foreign factories in the future. The importance of this point need not be elaborated. At the first session of the International Labour Conference, it was approved that all countries enjoying concessions and other extraterritorial rights in China should adopt the same measures in the concessions or concession lands in accordance with the labor laws already established by the Chinese government, or implement the labor laws formulated by the Chinese government. International public opinion is paying so much attention to this, and countries such as England, France, and Japan have long implemented advanced factory laws to protect their own workers. In my opinion, if this issue is given appropriate attention, it should not be difficult to resolve it satisfactorily. (3) The effectiveness of the Factory Act after its implementation also lies in the help of labor and management. Article 16 of the Factory Inspection Law promulgated by the government states that "Factory inspectors shall provide opinions to the factory and workers on increasing safety and preventing dangers, and shall devise ways to make both parties cooperate to improve the hygiene and safety of the factory." Its intention is in line with the 20th recommendation of the Fifth International Labour Conference regarding factory inspection. In recent decades, the task of factory inspectors has increasingly focused on cooperating with labor and management to improve the conditions of factories and workers, rather than focusing solely on investigation and punishment. The history of factory inspections in various countries proves that the reduction of violations does not lie in the severity of punishment, but in whether the inspector can cooperate with both labor and management to prevent problems before they occur. Therefore, factory owners in various countries have recently changed their previous suspicious and disgusted attitude towards inspectors and have come to regard inspectors as mentors and good friends for improving factory equipment. Now, when our country's factory management is urgently seeking improvement, this external assistance should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Incoming Letter</p>
<p>Respected Editor, I recently saw a section in your newspaper's local news column on the 25th of this month about a conflict between the comprador and tea servers of the Chang'an steamer. The details stated therein do not conform to the facts. Now I will describe the details of what happened and request that you make corrections. Upon investigation, when the Chang'an steamer arrived in Hankou, it happened to be the Lunar New Year. When it departed from Shanghai, the comprador Xiangqing notified all the tea servers that the Lunar New Year had been abolished this year. According to the company's orders, all personnel in all departments were to cancel the New Year celebration. However, the ship's crew members and the comprador's tallymen all contributed money to celebrate the New Year on their own. The tea servers mistakenly thought that the crew members and tallymen were all celebrating the festival, but the tea servers alone were not. They did not know the details and made rude remarks, scolding the comprador severely. After mediation by various staff members proved ineffective, the tea server leader, Zhuo Cixu, physically attacked the comprador. Seeing the menacing situation, Xiangqing fled to the main kitchen to avoid being hit. Zhao Shichun fell into the water after slipping on the snow while chasing the comprador, but was rescued immediately. When the conflict occurred, six tea servers had minor skin injuries, but were not seriously injured. As for Ren Jinding's death, the Hankou court confirmed that he died of illness. Currently, this case is awaiting investigation and judgment by the Hankou court. The information published in your newspaper is not accurate, so I am sending this special letter to request corrections to avoid causing disputes. I would be grateful. Respectfully yours, Li Xiangqing, comprador of the Chang'an Steamer, February 26th.</p>

<p>Commercial News: Financial and Gold Markets Continue Upward Trend</p>
<p>▲ The Atmosphere Dictates…Utter Chaos</p>
<p>▲ Changes Appear Constantly</p>
<p>Yesterday, February 26th, the bid price for gold continued to rise. The market situation was unpredictable and unstable. The danger of the waves was ultimately unavoidable and was truly controlled by the environmental atmosphere. People's minds were extremely confused. There were changes of fifteen or sixteen taels in both the morning and afternoon markets. As for foreign exchange, it strengthened and then weakened, eventually trending firmly. The listed price continued to narrow by one and a half notches. Overseas silver markets all fell, so the gold price opened high, and various firms were very hesitant to buy and sell. Firms such as Qian Changxiang, Chang Sheng Yong, etc., sold and then bought back. Yuan Mao, Yong Yuanheng, Yuanheng, and Cheng Yuan, etc., all had purchases. The Dalian gang, Tong Taichang, etc., all issued positions. Later, the market weakened from strong. It fell from 780 taels to within 70 taels, because the exchange rate turned weak, and large households sold off. And the Bank of England initially took one shilling and two pence one eight seven five, but later rose to two pence four three seven five. Until noon, speculators suddenly re-entered, and in an instant, the situation changed. The exchange rate stabilized, suddenly showing a strong upward trend, breaking through the 80-tael mark again, which was truly a meaningless move. The afternoon market initially seemed sharp, reaching 790 taels. Later, the Indian exchange rate reported an increase, and there were widespread rumors that a large amount of cash was being exported. Unexpectedly, there was no movement at all, which was truly due to the effect of the atmosphere. Therefore, people's minds turned downward, and there was a sharp drop of more than ten taels. The final calculation was 75 or 76 taels, and the cashiers of various firms were divided. As for spot goods, an additional six taels must be added. Is the forecast for the large strip to be lower again this morning?</p>
<p>▲ High Opening</p>
<p>From the opening of the April market in the morning, it rose by four taels and seven mace, to 773 taels and five mace, because the large strip did indeed fall by five sixteenths, and the silver price fell by one-half. Private telegrams also fell slightly by seven sixteenths. Later, Yu Da, Yifeng, Yong Yuanmao, Yong, etc., competed to purchase, continuing to rise by a huge ten taels, reaching 83 taels. And the exchange market was also good. Sanlin, Sumitomo, etc., all bought May and June Bank of England at 121875. When the shilling was announced, another household sold, so it retreated to 80 taels and five mace, but the listed price had narrowed by 375, the US dollar by 75, and the Japanese yen by four and seventy-five points. Moreover, Sumitomo Shanghai, etc., continued to take Bank of England at 1875, and Yuanheng Yuan, Sheng, etc., bought in, so at 9:30, it was 84 taels and five mace. After that, Bank of England at 1225 was difficult to sell, and the market easily faltered. Shunli, Hengyu, Tong Taichang, etc., all had completed transactions, but the price fell by seven or eight taels, to 76 and a half taels at ten o'clock and ten minutes. Suddenly, Dachengyuan, Yuan Mao Yong, and "Ben Tou" came in, and Hefeng and Shanghai did April Bank of England at 1225, and HSBC took April Citibank at 29 yuan and 125, and in just over ten minutes, it rose back by four or five taels, to 81 taels at 10:30. Later, the storm intensified, and sellers flourished. Qian Changxiang, Yongfeng, Fuyu, etc., sold off, so Bank of England could close at 12375, falling miserably by twelve taels, with only two taels of rise and fall. By 11:30, it had broken through 70 taels, suddenly falling to 69 taels. Before long, Anda, etc., bought in April Bank of England at 4375, and Qian Changxiang, Zhifeng Yong, Chang Sheng Yong, Zhen Changxiang, etc., took advantage of this to chase in, so the market atmosphere was sustained, and it soared by more than twelve taels. At noon, the closing price was 81 taels and five mace, and it was hyped up by another four or five taels, reaching 86 taels. Therefore, the price of goods was raised by three and a half taels, and the announced price had been changed to 840 taels and six mace, calculated to be suppressed by 60 to 70 taels. At noon, it was only calculated to be 58 or 59 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Dipped Before Closing</p>
<p>The afternoon market came out at 89 and a half taels, followed by 90 taels, which was the remaining momentum after the noon close. Then, due to the sale by the Guangdong gang, it retreated to 84 and a half taels. The Indian exchange rate rose slightly by three annas, and then rose again to 88 taels. Suddenly, it returned by two annas, and the supply on the table exceeded the demand. Moreover, Bank of England issued April Bank of England at 1875, so it had already fallen to 84 taels and five mace. Yuan Mao Yong, etc., bought in, and Zhejiang Mitsui took May and June Bank of England at 25. At 2:20, it was 85 taels. After that, the ups and downs were uncertain. After 2:30, people's minds became more turbulent, because the cash export was temporarily delayed, causing the market price to plunge by five or six taels. At around 3:00, it was calculated to be 78 and a half taels. At this time, Chen Fengyong bought, and then added six taels. At 3:30, it was 84 and a half taels. Later, the Indian exchange rate continued to rise by six annas. In particular, Tong Taichang, Sheng Da, etc., sold off, and the storm was fierce, with a sharp drop of more than ten taels, but there were several taels of rise and fall from time to time. At 4:00, it suddenly became 72 taels and three mace, and in an instant, it rose by another four taels to seven and a half taels. The closing price at 4:30 was 76 taels, which was an increase of seven taels and two mace compared to the previous day. The highest price during the day was 90 taels, and the lowest price was 69 taels, a difference of 21 taels. The price of goods opened at 73 taels and eight mace in the morning, closed at 85 taels at noon, and 8 taels and a half in the afternoon. The closing price was 75 taels. The announced price was suppressed by a small 50 to 65 taels. The ledger price was 75 taels in the morning, 81 taels in the afternoon, 70 taels to 77 taels, and the water replenishment was 72 taels in the afternoon and 67 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Hesitant In and Out</p>
<p>The transactions of various firms were calculated as follows: Fuchang, Yuanheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Yu Da, Yuan Cheng, and Yifeng Yong all entered. Tong Taichang, Shunli, Deheng, and Yongfeng all exited. Chang Sheng Yong, Qian Changxiang, Zhifeng Yong, Da Decheng, Yuan Tai, Dingchang, and Futaiheng had erratic entries and exits. In the afternoon, Shunli, Yuan Mao Yong, Chen Fengyong, and Qian Changxiang all entered. Sheng Da, Yuanheng, and Tong Taichang all exited. Wanxing, Fuchang, Yuan Tai, Da Decheng, Futaiheng, Taifeng Cheng, Huiyuan, Yuan Chun, etc., had entries and exits from time to time. The Dalian gang bought a total of 2,450 strips and sold a total of more than 3,000 strips, which was a long-term sell-off. The Guangdong gang also sold off 1,000 long-term positions.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange is Tighter</p>
<p>Yesterday, the London and New York gold markets continued to report lower prices, but the market situation did not change significantly. The exchange rates between England and the United States rose and fell slightly. As for the Shanghai market's foreign exchange, there were occasional ups and downs, likely due to the expansion of the gold bidding turmoil, with a difference of 21 taels throughout the day. The result was an increase, which was truly controlled by the atmosphere. The HSBC listed price has narrowed by one and a half notches. The English gold is 375, now at one shilling and two pence.

Chinese gold merchants are still selling off to cover their positions, and the English gold is estimated to have reached over 200,000 pounds. Although the bank's appetite is not bad, the price is sometimes firm and sometimes weak. Shanghai, Zhengjin, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, HSBC, Anda, Mitsui, etc., all absorbed it, but in the afternoon, the Bank of England, Mitsui, Shanghai, Mecca, etc., had already sold tens of thousands of pounds, which was the closing in the gold industry. In addition, approximately 200,000 US dollars were sold. HSBC and Mitsui made slight advances, and the trading volume of Japanese yen was only several hundred thousand dollars. By the close, each exchange rate was calculated to have narrowed by 125 for English gold, 1875 for the US dollar, and increased by 175 for the Japanese yen compared to the previous noon.

The closing of the auction was more active than the sale, and bond prices rose step by step. Except for the current spot 19 customs, the entire six spot March term, and the 19 customs bonds spot increasing by more than one yuan, others also continued to improve by three or four jiao. In addition, the current gold spot has risen by three yuan compared to the middle of the month.

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Initially High and Then Low</p>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell. The speed of changes in recent days has made it difficult for people to grasp. However, a certain industrialist has a very strong sense of high-level thinking, because cotton is difficult to loosen, and there is no hope for a turnaround in exchange rates. Indian cotton is becoming increasingly difficult to import, so most of the long positions are held tightly and not released. However, the current yarn sales are quite sluggish, and various gangs are lifeless. According to one part, the price is too high, so sales are sluggish. However, the period is currently the peak season in spring, and there is still hope for development. It is difficult to predict what the future holds. In short, it must depend on the amount of demand and raw materials for advancement and retreat.</p>
<p>▲ Human Bids Return Soft</p>
<p>The human bid market opened in the morning, and because the gold price was high and the foreign cotton was rising, the market atmosphere was tight, and each rose by one or two taels and eight or nine qian. In the second and third markets, the price turned down due to a lack of buyers. As a result, each month's bids rose by two, three, or four qian, but large households still entered. The market opened firmly again in the afternoon, rising by eight or nine qian. The second and third markets fell slightly because the raw cotton was slightly weak, and each month fell by two taels and four qian to one tael and three, four, or five qian. The total transactions for the day were 25,800 bales. It was found that 1,300 bales were sold by Dafu, 1,900 bales by Mingde, 3,050 bales by Xincheng, and 800 bales by Yicheng. 1,300 bales were bought by Gongtai, 1,150 bales by Shenchang, 2,450 bales by Ruida, 1,800 bales by Changfeng, 800 bales by Yichang, and 900 bales by Tianlong. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Human Bid Closing Prices: Increase/Decrease, Balance</p>
<p>May: 1791, down 10, 31,650</p>
<p>March: 1763, down 21, 150</p>
<p>June: 1790, down 13, 28,300</p>
<p>April: 1785, down 9, 37,500</p>
<p>July: 1792, down 13, 10,600</p>
<p>▲ Yarn Sales Quiet</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still quiet. It was found that the statistics for the various gangs buying throughout the day were 480 bales. The market price was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. When the market closed, the price tended to fall extremely, and there were no transactions. Among the out-of-town gangs, 200 bales entered the inland, 65 bales entered Nanyang, 75 bales entered Hankou, and 125 bales entered Guangdong, it was said.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Situation Slightly Soft</p>
<p>The cotton market trend is slightly weak, but Indian cotton is still rising fiercely, and the exchange rate has shrunk greatly, so there is a great upward force. In fact, it had already risen sharply on the previous day, and most of the retail short sellers cut their losses and liquidated, so there was a lack of buyers in the market. Generally cautious people see the recent ups and downs and dare not move. Only Japanese merchants have a slight intention to sell, but they are still spreading air in the market. In short, once the price is high, those outside the industry are helpless. Most buyers have to look at 50 taels. However, the current cotton procurement by various factories is very sluggish, because the yarn sales are not good.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Bids Trend Weak</p>
<p>The Hankou bid market atmosphere was quite firm before the market opened in the morning. Because Indian cotton rose sharply, most people expected a big rise. However, the opening rose slightly by two qian. Due to the lack of new buyers, the second and third markets each fell by one qian to two qian. The market atmosphere was slightly weak in the afternoon, and each fell by five and a half qian to eight and a half qian. The total transactions for the day were 61,000 dan. It was found that 4,100 dan were sold by Yuda, 2,500 dan by Mingde, 2,400 dan by Hengde, and 3,400 dan by Shenchang. 5,800 dan were bought by Yuda, 3,000 dan by Gengfeng, 2,700 dan by Changfeng, 2,200 dan by Tianlong, and 1,700 dan by Heshen. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Hankou Bid Closing Prices: Increase/Decrease, Balance</p>
<p>May: 4490, down 90, 71,100</p>
<p>March: 4595, down 85, 61,200</p>
<p>June: 4510, down 75, 57,100</p>
<p>April: 4500, down 70, 55,900</p>
<p>July: 4520, down 80, 32,200</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Demand Continues Thin</p>
<p>The current cotton business is still flat. The source is estimated to be 300 bales of Yaohua.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 47.25, Received by Hongzhang Factory: 200 Pieces</p>
<p>Spot Delivery to Factory Again: 48.00, Received by Sulun Factory: 150 Pieces</p>
<p>Again: Stock Delivery of Wusong Cotton: 45.50, Received by Longmao Factory: 300 Dan</p>
<p>Again: Delivery to Factory of US Cotton and Third-Grade Equivalent</p>
<p>▲ US Cotton Sold Off and Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but later became weak due to selling by spot merchants and reactionary selling off. It is estimated that the futures fell by 4 to 7 pounds. The spot fell by 5 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 5 or 6 points, and the spot rose by 18 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 30 points. Indian cotton initially concealed the rise of US cotton, but later, due to purchases by large speculators, the market became more expensive. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 5 rupees, and the distant term rose by 4 rupees. Aomura rose by 7 rupees, and the distant term rose by 8 rupees. Bailuoxi rose by 7 rupees, and the full term rose by 6 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left: (Telegram of the 25th)</p>

<h3>The Shanghai County Reorganization Committee Uncovers a Major Gambling Den in Sanlintang</h3>
<p>As the old lunar year ends, bad habits spring up in the countryside, especially gambling. A group of unemployed vagrants gather to gamble and skim profits, treating it as a profession. The Shanghai County Reorganization Committee, in order to eliminate this bad habit, has repeatedly put forward suggestions and handed them over to the County Public Security Bureau for execution, and also sent personnel to inspect various districts in person. Unexpectedly, yesterday the committee learned that a major "yao tan" gambling game was being played overnight in the Sanlintang Qigan Street Club, lasting all night and being completely unbridled. Therefore, members of the committee secretly went to the gambling venue late at night to investigate the truth. Immediately, they joined forces with Zhang, the bureau chief of the Fourth Branch of the County Public Security Bureau, leading many police officers, and successively captured forty-eight gamblers. They also seized gambling equipment and gambling funds, and brought them all to the bureau. After Bureau Chief Zhang interrogated the gamblers one by one, he meted out punishments separately. It is reported that the branch bureau has reported the details of the crackdown to the County Reorganization Committee, and the committee has resolved to send a letter to the County Government ordering the Public Security Bureau to thoroughly investigate the main criminals in the case in order to prevent a recurrence.</p>
<h3>Three People Die Tragically</h3>
<p>▲ Found Dead: Yesterday (the 26th) morning at 7 a.m., a male corpse was found lying dead at the end of the back alley of the Beishun Zangli in Xinmin Road, Zhabei. He was about forty years old, with a long face, wearing a dark blue imitation straight tribute wool, an old cotton robe, gray cloth cotton pants, bareheaded and barefoot. Wang Shutong, a policeman from post number 17 of the first precinct of the fourth district, found the body, reported to the station chief, and immediately ordered the neighborhood head to report to the local court. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhao Zikui was dispatched, accompanied by clerks and police officers, to the scene. After examination, it was confirmed that he had died of illness. As no family members were found, the neighborhood head was instructed to collect a coffin from the charity hall for burial in the public cemetery pending verification.</p>
<p>▲ Fell to Death: Carpenter Wang Zonggen, 24 years old, from Pudong, residing at 300 Qipu Road, yesterday morning at 10:30 a.m. was working on the new Western-style prison on Huade Road. Accidentally, he fell from the seventh floor. His head was split open, and blood flowed from his abdomen. He died instantly. The construction contractor reported to the Tilamqiao Police Station, which ordered Hua Bu number 1815 to come to the scene. The body was taken by vehicle to Tongren Hospital, and then to the coroner's office to await examination.</p>
<p>▲ Crushed to Death: An old woman, surname unknown, about fifty or sixty years old, resembling a female servant,</p>
<p>Yesterday at about 2:15 p.m., she was walking through the intersection of North Zhejiang Road when she was suddenly hit by tram number 48 on Route 6 heading north to the train station. Unable to avoid it, she was knocked to the ground, breaking her skull and left leg, and causing her large intestine to bleed. She died instantly. Hua Bu number 2677 was then dispatched to arrest [the driver] and transport the body to Tongren Hospital for examination at the coroner's office.</p>
<h3>Fire Broke Out in Yangjiazhai the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>At 12 o'clock the night before last, a fire suddenly broke out at the home of Shandong resident Lü Xinmai near the Tuditang in Yangjiazhai, Pudong. The fire was fierce and unapproachable. The fire brigade drove to the scene and put out the fire with water. A total of four and a half bungalows were destroyed. Afterwards, the police of the Fourth Squad of the Police Department ordered the police to transfer Lü to the Third District of the Public Security Bureau to investigate the cause of the fire for verification.</p>
<h3>Golden Theater to Screen Swordsmen Feature Film</h3>
<p>In the early days of American film development, a type of swordsmen and detective feature film was popular, such as "The Adventures of Bao Lian" and "The Black Hand Gang." Those with a silver screen habit can still talk about their merits. As love short films became popular, swordsmen feature films were temporarily eliminated. In fact, this type of feature film is the most difficult to produce, and the compact plot and serious acting are most likely to excite emotions and boost morale. The owner of the Golden Grand Theater, in view of this, specially ordered a variety of the latest swordsmen detective feature films from the United States. The most recently arrived is the complete series of "The Green Forest Monster." The plot twists and turns, the thrilling fights, and the mysterious mechanisms of the film are compact and amazing in every episode, without the shortcomings of current films that are all about flesh and boring love stories. It is said that the film will be released to the public soon.</p>
