<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯竟接受日方調查團之建議耶</h3>
<p>巴黎方面頃次傳達吾人以一種極足令人詫異憂慮同時更大惑之消息。即為二十一日國聯理事會公開會議。已决定接受日方極其狡猾之組織滿洲調查團之建議。派遣委員團赴滿調查。理事會各代表均視派員調查為解决東北問題之一方法。施公使雖表示日不撤兵不能接受之意。然終無以挽回其堅决之主張。吾人聽取此種消息之後。當可立即斷定十月二十四日理事會日軍須先撤退之决議案。已全部推翻。而日來考慮盟約第十六條規定之說更掃盪浄盡。吾人不能不承認國聯維護和平主持公理之精神與態度。已為暴力所屈服。已顯呈突然之轉變</p>
<p>吾人猶記組織滿洲調查團之主張。在國聯第二次集會時已曾經提出中國曾表示同意。而日本則曾嚴詞拒絕者。以日方之拒絕。國聯在第二次集會時。此主張即予撤消。今以日方之建議。國聯則又欣然樂從。且視為解决東北問題之唯一方法。在日方之强橫無理。出爾反爾。吾人固不欲多言。但國聯何以一以日方之主張為主張。毫無自維威信之能力。此為吾人所不解者一。</p>
<p>齊齊哈爾之砲聲。旣不能促起國聯之注意。錦州之襲擊。亦不能引起國聯之關心。自九月十八日以。來日軍所加諸我國之一切迫害與暴行。以及强佔我國土。破壞我主權。煽動我東北獨立種種鐵一般之事實。旣都不能為日方破壞和平背棄盟約之證明。則其他足資證明者。更為何事何物。調查團所可調查所欲調查者。又果為何事何物。此為吾人所大惑不解者二。</p>
<p>國聯旣已决定派員赴滿調查。則此種調查之結果及調查以後。國聯都應負絕對責任。換言之。即此種調查應為代表國聯。非代表某一國。尤非代表個人。今國聯旣一面通過派遣委員團赴滿調查。而同時又贊同挪威代表調查國當認為個人之代表。而非國家之代表之建議。如調查國僅能代表個人。則其權力已輕如鴻毛。其作用亦微如塵芥。調查即能有所得。亦與不調查等。國聯又何必多此一舉。重累諸調查委員跋涉長途。此為吾人所大惑不解者三。</p>
<p>日代表芳澤旣一面提出調查團之建議。而另一方面。日政府又提出（一）調查委員不得評論東三省日軍行動。（二）該地如有中日直接談判。委員不得干涉。（三）委員不僅調查滿洲。且須調查與確知中國其餘各地之紛亂情形。同時更切實否認其一切暴行為戰爭行為。而僅為自衛。且聲明决不接受休戰之提議。夫調查委員旣不能評論東三省日軍之行動。期所可調查者。僅限於中國。則已完全剝奪調查之公正性。使無實施權力之可能。委員不能干涉中日之直接談判。則調查亦屬絕無必要。至於中國各地之情形。姑無論其混亂與整齋。此為中國之內政問題。與國聯或日本毫不相關。如所謂混亂情形。為指排斥日貨運動。則此種運動完全為日人暴行之所激起。中國人民排日運動之熱烈。即為日人暴行之反證。亦即為中國人民和平自衛之愛國行為。國聯殊無調查之權。日人提此三條件。以及更明顯的反對休戰。其對於調查建議之毫無誠意。已昭然畢露。誠如日方所提三條之限制。調查團將何以行使其權力。誠如日方反對休戰之聲明。則其暴行不僅决不停止。且隨時可以擴大。設使國聯之調查團。正在滿洲進行其調查之工作。而日軍藉口自衛。或其他口實。忽然擴大其戰爭行為。吾人誠不能預揣國聯之調查團。將何以覆命。國聯又將何以維持其威信。凡此種種。危機至多。日本外交上之狡猾與陰險。不待智者而後知。而國聯對此建議。則反極樂觀。認為解决東北問題之唯一方法。此為吾人所大惑不解者四。</p>
<p>更進一步言。目前解决東北問題。與和緩嚴重局勢之先决問題首在撤退日軍。日軍撤退。其他問題。始有考慮之餘地。否則即以武力威脅中國訂城下之盟。斷非中國所能承認。國聯在第一次集會時。已有撤退日軍之勸告。而在第二次集會時。則更有日軍須於十一月二十四前儘先撤退之鄭重决議。而今日國聯秘密協議多日。不言撤兵。而言調查。不回顧第一第二兩次會議之議案。乃舉而全部推翻。日代表屢次承認撤兵之諾言。國聯亦絕不回顧。中國代表歷次之聲明與要求。國聯尤若充耳不聞。如國聯承認其今日之决議是。則應宣佈其前此决議之非。如承認日方之暴行是。則應宣佈中國之聲請非。如承認日方之背盟食言是。則應宣佈中國遵守盟約服從公理非。二者必居其一。換言之。即國聯决不應有兩種精神兩種互相矛盾之態度。而依據今日所顯示之事實。則實已困於自相矛盾之陷阱。此為吾人所大惑不解者五。</p>
<p>此五不解。益滋中國人民無限之憂慮與恐怖。吾人不能不承認國聯態度已突呈轉變。而國聯之假面具。已從此揭破無餘矣。嗚呼。</p>

<h3>日本醞釀政潮</h3>
<p>安達倡組聯合內閣</p>
<p>政友會表示不合作</p>
<p>日聯二十二日東京電　安達內相昨日正午與賴母木·富田·兩總務及山道幹事長會商重要政務、至閣議散後、復接見山道·中野·古屋等要人交換意見、當晚十時半發表聲明、渠謂欲打開現內閣之難關、並增進實力、不得不順應形勢、組織各政黨協力之聯立內閣、</p>
<p>又電、安達內相主張組織聯立內閣後、町田·小泉·櫻內·渡邊·田中等各閣員集會决定、始終擁護若槻內閣、召開下屆議會、並推櫻內商相為代表、詢問內相意見、不料尚未會商以前安達突然發表聲明書、故各閣員對安達之舉、非常驚駭、現正討論對付方法、</p>
<p>日聯二十二東京電　櫻內商相本日上午往訪安達內相、質問昨晚所發表聲明書之意義、安達答稱、（余所深信者即如該聲明書中所載者、余覺得最好在此時組織以政黨為基礎之强力的協力內閣、倘政友會拒絕、則擬維持現狀、如不能維持現狀、則當另行設法、使現內閣加一些新的改變、此層若槻首相當自能知之）、商內兩相均意見一致、嗣後當竭力謀疎通意見、以善處時局、櫻內商相又往訪町田農相報告與內相會見之情形、京於政局彼此交換意見、</p>
<p>安達內相本日下午二時往訪若槻首相、說明發表聲明書之經過、與本人之眞意所在、關於在大演習出發前、首相向內相徵求之善處策及其他種種、詢明首相之意向後、促其立下决心、而對政友會方面亦擬向之開始正式交涉、關於一切準備等似正在交換意見中、</p>
<p>電通二十二日東京電　政府中人對於安達內相之促進聯立內閣、察其行動、殊深駭怪、僉謂安達當陸軍大學習以前、促若槻首相善為處置、組織各政黨協力之聯立內閣、並以犬養總裁為閣僚之一、若槻對犬養之入閣、已表同意、及安達返京、堅持前見、但政友會對於犬養入閣、均不贊成、並譏安達之行動實未了解現狀、或謂聯立內閣縱令不能實現、然政府及與黨內部運動猛進時、則若槻首相行將隱退、故由安達自身立塲觀之、其計畫似為有力云、</p>
<p>又電、關於聯立內閣運動案、政友會總裁犬養毅愼重考慮之結果、認為此案頗不適當、渠對於時局、决採單獨進行之方針、政友會各領袖亦表同意、茍安達提議該案時、極端拒絕、聞犬養將於二十四日發表意見、（二十二日電通社電）</p>

<p>（本日報戴安達內相之聲明、無非安達內相表示自己之信念、解釋大學習前車次談話中之誤會而已、關於政局無可憂之關係、請放心）</p>
<p>路透社二十三日東京電　今日內務大臣安達發表文告、主張組織國民政府、以應付國家所遭之嚴重財政與外交困難、閣潮似將於旦夕發生、嗣首相若槻與內務大臣互換意見、彼此以為內務大臣之計畫、在原則上殊為正當、惟處目下之政治環境中、殊難實現、安達之宣言、對於民政黨表示信任、第謂處此嚴重之大局、當泯除黨見、而以國家之幸福為前提、其言引起朝野種種之猜測、或料將組織超黨內閣、以朝鮮總督宇垣將軍為首相、或謂民政黨與政友會將組織混合內閣、聞政友會不贊成此舉、按安達為民政黨最有勢力者之一、且為內閣諸領袖之一、</p>
<h3>甘地倡議　　　　種族待遇平等</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十一日孟買電　甘地在倫敦發表對於種族待遇之意見、使印度富人所感受之困難、反較歐籍商人為甚、而此等印度富人固皆甘地之黨徒也、甘地主張係於印度自主以後、將富源重行澈底分配、如此則有產者與無產者之間、將發生殘酷之衝突、而其結果則於印人歐人兩俱無益、至一般民衆則以甘地建議强迫富人以其悖入之財散諸貧民、用心良為公允、然實際上甘地計畫與共產主義並無二致、至於英國商務上利益、則更受甘地計畫之威脅、蓋英人在印恃武力為護符、故得享受優厚之特權、平心論之、實無正當名義、甘地計畫注意在此、若不幸實行、則英人利益均將發生問題矣、又印度富豪與甘地友善者、前此對於甘地之不抵抗運動曾予以資助、今見甘地之計畫不利於已、或將與之决絕而不復為之援助、亦未可知、</p>

<h3>歡聲震動四野　　　曁南痛擊西捕</h3>
<p>精神實力過人</p>
<p>西捕威名掃地</p>
<p>結果三對零</p>
<p>東華失敗之翌日、忽而曁南三對零爭勝西捕、惟是傷心人猝逢快意事、眞是又悲又喜、凡是球迷、莫不人同此心、心同此理、爰述曁南大戰勝利經過、以告諸未往者、</p>
<h3>顯本領曁南克敵</h3>
<p>男兒本色</p>
<p>逸園六七千觀衆、手舞足蹈、神飛色揚、互祝曁南克敵之成功、為我民族揚眉吐氣、曁南中衛綫之出色、兩內衛之堅硬、直超出以前之紀錄、內顧無憂、前鋒乃得盡量進展、陳鎭和勇冠三軍、義無反顧、第一球之成功、得力於此也、第二球之獲、由於五前鋒合作佳妙、致敵人顧此失彼、丘東炎馬趕到、敵開失陷、最後一球、亦係丘所造成、疾出如矢直中綢內、守門對之無可奈何也、</p>
<p>梁樹棠　符和萱</p>

<p>陳福忠　梅洪寶</p>
<h3>逢勁敵西捕拜服</h3>
<p>威名何在</p>
<p>西捕固為足球界一世之雄、不意昨逢勁敵曁南、竟至全軍覆沒、前鋒唯一危險人物衛根生、被梁氏監視無活動餘地推納滅色傑克柔弱、法蘭斯智勇齊全、逢𨻶必進、然而荘世鴻軟硬兼施、便渠雷池難越、偶然侵入腹地、左馮右江、應付裕如、上半時西捕中衛綫與兩內衛互相維護、滴水難入、下半時呈散疏現象、連遭失陷、著名中堅軋許對此强敵、亦覺束手無策、</p>

<p>史谷德　　　　　推　納</p>
<p>蒲　斯　　　　　軋　許　法蘭斯</p>

<h3>陳鎭和奮勇破關</h3>
<p>敵人喪膽</p>
<p>大戰開幕、又方各以强將勁卒相抵抗、內部均堅硬、都不得任意欲為、彼此往返、咸在中域區內詔光飛流、十五分鐘轉眼已過、符和萱行梁之傳、轉予中鋒陳鎭和、陳氏孤軍深入、巧避三人精誠所趨、金石為開、果然奮勇破關敵人喪膽矣、西捕反撲、守門被圍、幸而敵人犯規、安然出險、未幾符和萱射中一球、越位取消、梅洪　挑送左方、羅海光挾之疾進、守門趨前擭之出險、上半時曁南以一對零占先、</p>
<h3>連環陣又告成攻</h3>
<p>合作佳妙</p>
<p>下半時似屬另一時期曁南見進步、西捕反退化、球之往來、多在曁南脚旁、其故西捕中衛綫失其樞鈕之職、致前後氣絡不通也、斯時曁南氣𦦨萬丈、進撲甚烈、十八分鐘時、五前陣互相傳遞、如連環陣、由梅而羅而陳而符、最後由丘東炎撲地掃入、成二對零</p>
<h3>丘東炎二次奏功</h3>
<p>歡聲雷動</p>
<p>西捕二球旣失、全軍怒髪冲冠、幾次探試、終難過江馮之關守門膝蓋受傷、在在有失守之虞、梅洪寶符和萱累次遠射、都未命中、羅海光腿傷、依然作戰、不欲未弱也、陳福忠挑送前方、丘東炎在三十碼處、乘守門不備、出其迅雷不及掩耳之脚頭、一擊中的、觀者大喜、歡聲雷動、曁南勝利在握、堅守江山以防數人反襲、然而敵人强弩之末、無能為力、結果曁南三對零勝西捕、是為西人會甲組賽之一幕、</p>

<h3>紗花　　　上週紗花衰頹如故</h3>
<p>入標跌落二三兩　紗巿在此週間異常衰弱、因暴日侵略日甚、黑垣被奪、人心大為恐慌、而金融奇緊、國事多難、實銷停滯、各帮毫無生氣、投機者復羣爭而來傾售、巿盤愈難立定、週末本月跌破五十兩關口、幸各廠底貨尚薄、尚能帶緊一㸃、總之銀根不鬆、時局不安、前途殊少樂觀、標紗價本月份比前週跌三兩、遠期跌一二兩不等云、</p>
<p>棉花仍在疲途中　棉巿一週以來、尚屬平疲、但美印棉巿依然悲觀、巿價步向下游、故各廠購辦日巨、對於本棉絕無問訉之意、蓋早已吸飽外棉、木棉毫無需用之必要、所以巿氣十分渙散、但貿方以各路來源缺乏、拉緊不放鬆、總之世界棉業狀况、異常不振、上漲之力較為减少、不過目前以到貨未旺、常能支持、照此情形、將後難免有一度大變動發現也、現棉交易、在此週中、外棉亦少成交、此因多數廠家吸足、更無餘胃再進本棉也、至美棉來電、比前星期報價、亦跌四十磅音云、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>庚子拳匪之變。八國聯軍進逼燕都。勢如破竹。祇馬玉崑聶士成兩軍。拒敵於天津楊柳青一帶。聶力戰陣亡。馬獨力難支。且戰且退。清廷聞變倉猝。兩宮蒙慶。所有禁衛軍。並無一兵一騎扈從西上也。日軍因拳匪戝其使館書記。懷恨在心。城破時。擬逞其報復之野心。屠殺洩償。而當時聯軍統帥。為德大將瓦德西。年高德遇。頗有人道主義。首先入城者。為德日兩軍。瓦出令禁止屠殺。燕京民衆。得以幸逃慘刧。咸爭俎瓦氏之德不已。迨入城後瓦設大營於清宮。嚴加守衛。防聯軍之入宮偷刧寶物也。而日俄兩軍時有越宮墻而作軌外行動者。（詳載諸家筆記）宮中珍寶。流入東瀛者最夥。彼邦博物院中之希世奇珍。均於彼時捆載而去者也。假使當時無瓦氏之執法。則燕京屠殺之慘。當不亞於揚州十日。嘉定三屠。而清宮中希世珍寶。當早刧掠無餘。盡入倭奴之手掌中矣。</p>

<h3>東北兩少年</h3>
<p>十一月十六日看報見有楊雲史贈馮庸的一首詩，末一句是：（東北長城兩少年。）這兩少年大槪是指張學良與馮庸吧。最近一期的生活週刋特載北平出版之火把中的一段驚人的新聞叙，述省亡國危中之張學良在北平幹那浪漫生活很詳。馮庸大學校馮庸也不會拿禦俄之精神去禦日，却於寗粵代表會議將了之時親率東北學生六百人南下請願宣傳。請願宣傳豈是長城之天職呀！我看了這些事，如骨在喉，吐出來吧！</p>
<p>（一）哀張學良　　　　（二）勉馮庸</p>
<p>東北長城兩少年。　　　　東北長城兩少年。</p>
<p>長城躱到黃河邊。　　　　長城應去嫩江邊。</p>
<p>黃河之水可濯足。　　　　嫩江之水可濯纓。</p>
<p>美人歡笑國人哭。　　　　江山為重風頭輕。</p>
<p>（小註）嫩江橋是馬占山孤軍獨戰日本處</p>
<h3>馬將軍雖敗猶榮</h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>從來自安於弱。而諱言戰者敗。自恃其强而好為戰者亦敗。此其理無中外一也。蓋由前論之。養兵百萬。不發一卒。坐視大好之山河。委於他人之手。徒以國聯之議為可恃。非戰之公約可靠。卒使倭虜猖狂。稱兵犯我。襲吾遼寗之不足。復佔據我龍江。其失地之因。不在吾孤軍抗日之馬將軍。而在握有兵權者昧然不顧。故此次黑省之陷落。與瀋陽之失守不同。由後論之。勝敗兵家之常事。以德皇威廉之不可一世。有囊括全球併呑天下之勢。誰敢當其鋒者。乃乘勝輒驕。攻伐無已。卒至一蹶一振。為列强協約各國所挫。以自恃其兵甲之銳。可無敵於世界而不知屢用之。固未有不鈍且折者。今東亞之暴日。一西方之德意志耳。馬將軍縱彈盡援絕。不得不捲甲以退。再圖背城一戰。以冀恢復。然而以視擁兵坐大。敵臨城下。束手無策。而猶靦顏以號於人曰。此不抵抗主義者。吾國凡隷兵籍之士。其氣已為之一振矣。所不能者。旣庸軍國之重寄。復運帷幄之機宜。邊陲告警。聒耳欲聾。而一任閫外之單師。獨當一面。即聞變而始有北上聲援之消息。其乘時圖功。與忘身者。已相云萬萬。而矧粉飾圖治。或茍且應敵者之不能見亮於國人哉。傳曰。（君子聽鼓擊之聲。則思將師之臣於城外。）吾不知今之當局者抑何夢夢也。尤可笑者。民衆之弱㸃。以為黑垣之克保與否。唯饟糈耳。故從以金錢滲之。而不知此累累者非足以禦倭寇。馬將軍雖得之無用。試思陷於重圍之際。所少者何物耶。噫。吾謂馬將軍此役之敗。非馬將軍之敗也。寶吾國上上下下之敗也。壯矣哉。馬將軍雖敗猶榮。吾敬馬將軍。吾愛馬將軍。吾敢告今之治軍抗日一言。曰（唯馬首之是瞻。）</p>

<h3>哥倫布見逐於美洲</h3>
<p>— 乙未生</p>
<p>哥倫布之發見美洲。固已為世所共知。論者無不欽其秉志之堅苦而成功之偉大。於此發見美洲之第一人。亦即被逐於美洲之第一人。則知者甚尠。因記其事如下。</p>
<p>一千四百九十九年三月二十一日。加拉屈拉瓦之司令官鮑白蒂拉奉英廷命治哥倫布之獄。蓋哥倫布以貪黷及虐待士人。有希冀自躋於帝皇之野心等罪。而被控也。鮑白蒂拉於一千五百年八月自英起程。十月抵美。旣察得哥倫布罪狀非誣。讞乃定。而哥倫布遂鐐索　　。驅逐出美洲之境而返之西班牙。永遠禁絕其復踐彼身自發見之新大陸之土地。並喪失其在美之一切公權。其所乘以出境之小帆船名高達。此為自有美洲歷史以來。驅遂出境之第一人。而此人又適為首先身自發見美洲者。寗非異數　。</p>
<p>中國　獅酷愛和平馬占山一爪耳似醒覺似　動全體國民與國民政府何時醒何時動全球之注視與裁判　將隨之而轉移敎問全體國民與華封幾二老人同意慰勞東北之好男兒否耶　　辛壬冬相　書</p>
<p>余（樊氏自稱下仿此）奉外交委員會命。自吉林赴長春調查日軍暴行眞相旣畢。方携報告書返吉。懼日軍搜查藏之鞋中。車中華人甚少。坐余右者為二日軍。對面為數日人。咸獐首鼠目形狀委瑣。彼輩所談者乃東省問題。余亦無意聽之。</p>
<p>車抵距離吉林六十里之哈達灣。二日軍忽起立以刺刀向余。（刀尖距余胸僅三寸。）詢余來去之目的地。職業。及携帶何物。余甫答以返吉林故鄕一語。另一日軍突責余不知禮貌。乃因余坐而答之。未起立故也。彼大聲曰。（當汝與日人對語時。汝必須起立。並致敬意。速起立。否則刺刀將洞汝胸矣。）余在此威脅之下。知抗亦無益。惟有起立而已。彼乃將余帽擲之地上。開始搜查。余雖懼報告書為彼輩搜去。然不敢形之於色。坦然任其搜查。幸未發覺。</p>
<p>車抵吉林。復被搜查。彼輩以仍無所獲。乃蹴余。令余速行。余僱車往友人家。街中日軍搜查華人者。到處皆是。二日後余復返長。</p>
<p>余在長春約十日。日軍通告云。凡外交委。員會委員胥在捉拿之例。余乃避往吉林目睹軍法委員長韓君遭慘殺。及外交委員徐君被捕而為熙洽所釋等事。十月十三日風聲日緊。余思吉林不可久居。遂赴車站乘車避往他處。經過新開門。（吉林城門名）日軍在城門口置機關槍。搜查行人。凡為華人。無論男女均不能免。日軍偶而興至。開槍擊斃華人之事。尤屬司空見慣。日軍因余服西裝而着華履。以為不相稱。乃被捕。幸賴三寸不爛之舌。始得釋。然後經大連來滬。</p>
<p>以下為余目睹他人受日軍虐待及慘殺之情形。</p>
<p>一、軍法委員長韓君因素仇視日人及韓人。吉林失陷後。韓君即為日軍所獲。縛其手足。置之獄中。先痛毆之。繼以刺刀刺之。復以槍擊其不致命處。終將韓君拋入火中焚死。悲慘萬狀令人酸鼻。</p>
<p>二、外交委員會委員徐君。與熙洽友誼甚厚。為日人捕獲後。由熙洽緩頰。盡出其私產以贖命。逃至大連。復被捕。恐亦遇害。</p>
<p>三、十月九日。一女學生為日軍姦污而死。東省與此女學生同一運命者。更僕難數。目睹者雖僅伊一人。然足以代表一切日軍對於我女同胞之行為矣。</p>
<p>四、長春省黨部被燬。黨員及學生尤為日軍之眼中釘。故傷亡不尠。十月十一日。美領自吉林赴長春視察事變眞相。日軍通令謂除熙洽外。華人概不得招待美領。美領寓華友榮厚家。為日為探知。遂派軍隊往詰榮厚。幸美領聞訊先行。榮厚雖未受任何處分。然此後已不能自由行動矣。</p>

<h3>鄕下人又到上海（二十五）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄕下人走進了梅園一望，他幾乎退了出來。原來那個梅園酒家，城巿而有園林景緻，裏面佈置了亭台樓閣，所以他說那個地方，確是花園。還看見在門口有一隻大鐵籠子，大鐵籠子裏，蟠着一條大蛇：還有幾個小鐵籠子，小鐵籠子裏有各種的小蛇。還看見門前排列着幾隻大缸，每隻缸裏，也都養着水產動物。有的缸裏，養着幾條黑魚：有的缸裏，養着幾隻大烏龜，上面還貼着一個紅條子，寫着［新到極大的小瑞］一行字：還有的缸裏，養着什麼海豹海狗之類。因此鄕下人却躊躇不敢進去，以為是走進了動物園裏來了。</p>
<p>他正想退出云的時候，却有一個穿着雪白圍身的人來，招呼他了。［請到這邊坐。］指着那邊一個空座。</p>
<p>鄕下人定晴看時，却是一個散座的廳，有好幾組人，都在那裏吃飯，有三人一組的，有兩人一組的，也有一個人的。鄕下人方纔安心，這的確是個吃飯的地方，他依着那個夥計指定的座位，便坐下來了。</p>
<p>夥計們把杯筷等安放下來了。鄕下人看見一雙象牙筷，那象牙筷上，還刻着那家店號的字，他想上海人辦事眞周到，刻了字以後，賊偷去了也無用了，但是倘然把筷子上的字磨去了，又有怎麼辦法呢？他正在一個人給那飯館子裏人擔憂，那個夥計，取過一張白紙，一支鉛筆，擺在鄕下人面前。鄕下人不免又心中疑惑起來：</p>
<p>［咦！做什麼呀！難道吃飯也要做紙頭，（註六），畫花押嗎］？</p>
<p>原來鄕下人在鄕下小茶館裏，看見人在茶館裏寫字，還有許多圖畫咧，經造咧，都聚集在那裏。這都是一搬鄕下人，把田地產業，賣出買進，便在小茶館裏，立一張契約，還要大家簽字。在公衆地方寫字，他祇看見如此，所以夥計拿了紙夂來·他誤認為敎他做紙頭了。</p>
<p>［請你點菜呀］。那個夥計，看鄕下人呆呆的望着紙筆，·他操着帶有粵音的上海話，如此催着。</p>
<p>［我不知道你們有什麼菜］？鄕下人這方纔知道紙筆是點菜用的。　　［有新到的響螺］。夥計算是報的新鮮的菜。</p>
<p>［響鑼？奇了！我走到了銅器店裏來了嗎］。</p>
<p>［註六］鄕間以寫契約名為做紙頭。</p>

<p>一小旅館內　擬加姦污、詎人數適為三與二之比、男女相配、尚餘一男、其餘下之一人、即表示不滿、遂以一人問題牽動全局、三人乃議决、全部自動犧牲、命兩女暫住一室、三人一齊離云、並約定翌日正午十二時再來、迨至前日近午、三人竟一云不返、兩女無奈、</p>

<h3>讀者通信</h3>
<p>怎樣是抵制日貨最切實有效德路在這空前未有的國恥中、只要不是喪心病狂的人、我相信誰也不會去買日貨抵制日貨、幾乎使全國一致、可是到底為什麼不能使日貨在中國商場上絕跡、我以為有兩筒原因、（一）買的人不知道所買的是日貨現在商場洋貨、滿目皆是、而日貨種類夥顧、標號籠統、沒有辨別眼光的人、自然無所適從、所以應將日貨分類調查出來、我以為現在的日貨、可分為下列幾類、（一）綢布類、（二）洋廣雜貨化裝類、（三）棉紗類、（四）西藥化學品類、（五）磁器類、（六）薪木燃料類、（七）南貨鹹魚類、（八）紙張文具玩物類、（九）鍾表類、（十）車行五金電料類、（十一）參藥類、（十二）鞋襪類、將以上各類東西、使眞實的商人去逐類調查出來、並調查各種日貨商標、例如日貨綢布類元貢呢、獵雁商標、這樣逐項調查後刋成日貨一覽表、每個商店必備貼此日貨一覽表、使買者得有標準、（二）不知道買日貨的利害關係、在有議的人自然自道買日貨的利害關係、但是中國不但是個貧困的國家、同時是文化落後的國家、所以許多鄕民、遠在偏僻的鄕間、他們簡　還不知什麼是日本、自然他們不知抵制日貨與國家的關係、他們只曉得價廉物美的東西、買來用就是、所以我們應該擴大宣傳、到鄕間去宣傳、使他們不用日貨這不但是抵制日貨有效、亦使全國民衆、能認識國家的危機、起來趕救國緊要事、我們知道鄕間農民都具有自然眞實的心腸、我們能以動人的話去宣傳、定能喚起他們的同情、一旦中國民衆、能自己起來衛國、日本眞算得什麼、買日貨的人絕跡、我想奸商的狡黠、其亦奈何、至於根本的話、我們自然要提倡實業、改良國貨、</p>

<h3>開誠（續）</h3>
<p>— 徐睡麟</p>
<p>一個女伶的復信</p>
<p>照常理、你旣這樣的盼望我我、也確實的需要你、我就不應該把這許多有失自己尊嚴的事實與心思告訴你、撕去了你心上為我而起的錦幕、使你赤裸裸地看見道平淡無奇而似乎還帶有醜惡的內容、不免有熄滅了你銳意向我的火燄的危險、</p>
<p>然而我現在情願冒着這個碰碎了靈魂底危險、因為要通過這個危險才能達到我所希望的幸福底樂園、在你我遇到的不久的期間內、我早經想攫得你、做了我時間上的情人、但是每到了要緊的當兒、你過於荘重了、反使我這個富於這種經騐的人、退了再前進的勇氣、你要曉得社會公認、女性先向男性表示傾慕是可恥的、然而這個只能禁止女性公然的表示、只要有一個男性、確是她所眞心傾慕的、她會很伶巧、很機警的向對方傅達她的意思、能使一個很倔强、很高傲的男子、變成很柔和、很卑微的伏到她的脚下、說得厲害一點、能使一個百鍊鋼的男子、變成繞指柔、供給她同玩弄釣絲一樣的隨戲、</p>
<p>一個男子、能受着這樣一個女子搬弄的支配、我相信他是幸福的、同時一個女子、能有一個男子使她這樣用盡心機的使他愛她、也是幸福的我對於你、你對於、我我相信已經到了這個境界、有好幾次、到了最緊要的當兒、仍然使你從我面前走脫了、我非常的失望、覺得我的魔力、竟然不能激動你、現在才曉得那時完全是由於沒有經騐的膽怯、祇得臨陣脫逃了、</p>
<p>我誤會了你的膽怯、以為是你瞧不起我、所以我以後遇到你、一方面是女為悅已者容、使出我平素認為最自然最動人的裝束、勾攝你靈魂、一方面疑眞疑假的拒絕你向我接近、使你發狂像是報復你似的、因為你拋棄了許多可以攫得我機會、以致誤會了變成這麼一幕趣劇、</p>
<p>你在這封信以前、連接有十五天沒有到我這裏來、你曉得我是何等的內疚、不應該這樣苦了你、竟使你離開我、我彷彿是失了件最珍貴的寶物一樣的痛惜、這十五天內面、每日二十四小時、沒有一分鍾、不在掛念你、每有一次敲門、總使我心內一跳、以為一定是你來了、誰知進門還是那些俗物、</p>
<p>在你這封信未來以前、我已下了一百二十分决心、祇要你再來、决不再使你放過、無論你如何荘重、我决定公然向你請求、寗可你當面羞辱我、笑罵我、凌虐我、我一定非攫得你不可、誰知你這十五天、並不是離開、却是醖釀着向我作最後的進攻、即使你再不來信、我也一定去找你、已往總是一天一天的牽延、總以為今天一定要來、誰知終是撲空、</p>
<p>我自問從來沒有一個男性、能使我這樣失魂落魄的記念他、我從來也沒有對於任何男性、這樣坦白眞誠供述我這許多心思、祇有現在對於你、我最初祇想攫得你做我時間上的情人、現在這個已經不能滿足我了、現在是要想你做我終身的情人、所以我才肯把我許多自私自利及不名譽的事告訴你、假使你肯跟我做終身的情人、這許多事、終久你總是曉得的、與其現在欺騙了你、不管是在你我之間埋伏了不幸的種子、使他將來變成崩裂的炸彈、不如現在一絲不掛的告訴你、也許你能原諒我的一切、如果你不能原諒我、即使現在欺騙了你、將來知到的時候、少不得還是要破裂、</p>
<p>蔭君、你不要笑我、我現在彷彿是忽然發了財的窮人、不曾發財的時候、想發財、發了財的時候、反來了若干的憂愁這十五天沒有消息的時候、我拼命的想你、你有了消息來、我反怕起來了、會不會因為我對於你過於開誠、反使你眞的冷了心、你這樣無消息的永久下去、雖是我去找你、你也避開不見我、使我曉得你嚴峻的拒絕我、我到反安心、不過你在我面前獻了若干日的殷情、竟未能有一點報答你、似乎覺得歉然、再則一個非常可愛的男性、有很多的機會可以得到他、却無因的走脫了、未能享受到你更動人的情感、將來過去日久、或許可以忘記的、現在你已很熱烈的走向我來了、而被我過分的熱情、致使你反而倒退了、如果我用高傲的語氣而簡單的答復你、允許你隨時到我身邊來、你一定同奉着聖旨一樣的喜歡、就會很迅速而帶着羞怯的情緒、走到我面前來、即使不能永久的得到你、在時間上我一定得到相當的滿足了、果眞使你倒退了、我不曉得要追悔到什麼程度呢、</p>
<p>然而、蔭君、我不肯這樣自私自利的欺騙你、我實在太愛你、你我有深的結合的可能、我們就結合、假使不能、我雖然是一個不幸的人、不願意再污蔑一個良善的靈魂、</p>
<p>人們總是好意懷疑人、尤其是對於女人的情慾問題、我這種身分的人、更是容易被人懷疑、而且我的行為、雖然是秘密的、實則等於半公開的在社會上流行着、你一旦同我在一起生活、馬上就有人冷嘲熱諷的對於你、一切一切、你終於會知到的、到了那時候、你也不曉得要痛苦到什麼程度、如果你允許了我這個請求、我用一種雇員或其他的名義使你生活在我的身邊、實際是情人的生活在一起、別人知到這個底細、也許還要羨慕你、我們如果生活在一起、祇要你能寬恕我、我情願我一生過去的事實一絲不隱瞞的告訴你、</p>
<p>蔭君、我的思想已經混亂、不能多多替你設想、請你接到信就到我身邊來、也許你還有許多情形我不明瞭、我們在一起深深的綿綿的開一個談判、决定今後的行止、那怕我們就是純友誼的開這樣一個談判、曼上、</p>
<h3>訓練</h3>
<p>— 煥明</p>
<p>自從軍訓部出了那張同司令部樣式相彷的告示後、軍事訓練課上操的人數驟見增多了、每天早晨六點二十分還要舉行一次早操、四天早操不到、就要同曠課四小時軍事訓練一樣的受一個大過的處罰、</p>
<p>嚴冬已經閃入南國了、在清晨、那侵入的朝寒除掉躺在溫暖的棉被中、誰有勇氣與牠相抗呢、敎官沿着宿舍尖銳的吹着集合笛、隨着寒風傳進急閉的窗牑、給風刮散的鐘聲、好像作夢一樣的響着、</p>
<p>全寢室裏的人都推開了被、跳下牀來、牙齒打戰、嘴裏噓噓的吸着冷氣、披上衣服、仍舊還想縮回被中尋暖去、集合笛吹得更尖銳了、大家祇得穿好衣服、鼓足勇氣的衝到操塲上去、</p>
<p>在操塲上人們、都緊線了全身來回跳躍躑躅、好像發了瘋似的、有幾個甚至於互相追打取暖、</p>
<p>早操完畢後、太陽已從東方躍出、雲霞現出明媚的光彩、寒冬清晨的自然美麗、與我們是不大親近的、在大家刷牙的時候、都不由得抬起頭向著天穹瞻望、</p>
<p>軍事訓練差不多每日下午都有的、因為校中的操塲太小、所以要借臨近的空地作為練操的塲所、完畢了下午的課程、大家都整裝待發了、隊伍向着校門呆伐齊整的走去、地上殺殺殺的的響着、</p>
<p>那片練操的空塲、廣闊得好像沒有邊一樣、大隊進了操塲冷風吹來、都祇好咬着牙抵抗寒氣、跑過呆、全身已暖和多了、於是就開始我們的操練、排長（都是我們的同學）尖聲的發着口令、他們喊得喉聲嘶啞、好不吃力、並且還要毫不客氣的校正各人的姿勢、</p>
<p>時間在這嚴肅機械的空氣中過去、天已漸漸的錯黯了、廣沓的操塲上、只能看見無數的黑影在不停的動著、好像不知天黑一樣、</p>
<p>街燈早已亮了、週遭更見肅靜、只能聽見那尖音的口令聲、和齊整的步伐聲、</p>
<p>集合笛響了、各排立刻歸隊、整了隊伍、開始首途返校、</p>
<p>街上行人很少、幾盞街燈疏落的亮的、步伐聲更見沉着有力、好像是與黑暗抗戰似的、</p>
<p>隊伍抵校時已伸手不能見五指、賴着宿舍裏的燈光照在操塲上、才能模糊想認、</p>
<p>一散了隊、宿舍裏驟見喧囂了、</p>
<p>（哈哈、老王你作排長眞太兇、）</p>
<p>（聲音還不壞、好像隻啞嗓的老母雞、）衆人聽了這句話不由得都鬨然的笑起來了、</p>
<p>在電燈光下、王排長給小張按在牀上打屁股、王排長沒命的呌着饒、這是他咎由自取、因為揩油了小張幾多餅干、老王急得要命、連忙喊着（立正）、但是毫無効力、不久小張才帶笑的放了手、</p>
<p>晚餐鍾響了、不久飯廳中就傳出叮叮噹噹的筷子聲碗聲、和雷鳴般的談笑聲、</p>
<h3>募捐歸來</h3>
<p>— 皇甫鈞</p>
<p>這次本巿各大學、為了援助孤軍禦敵的馬將軍、故在十九·二十日兩天、停課出發募捐、我也參與、在未出發前、我滿以為這一次的成績、一定可觀、因為這是實力的保護我們國土、凡中華國民、均應該爭先恐後的應募了、但是事實如何呢、唉、欲哭無淚、傷心極了、今天讓我借本刋的篇幅、將我募捐時承那位同宗同國的同胞、回答我的幾句話、寫在下面吧、</p>
<p>在戈登路口、碰到了一位戴着大英帽、穿着華達呢袍子的先生、我即上前說了一聲對勿住、並將我們募捐的理由和他談談、請求他隨意捐一些、那位先生却用了討厭的神氣說（沒有這一種規矩、什麼黑龍江馬占山、我不憧的、）那時我雖要想用我沸熱的血、眞摯的情、去勸那位先生—不是勸他捐錢、是勸他回心轉意、以國事為重、可是他已飛也似的跑去了、我不知他的（規矩）二字、作何解、</p>
<p>在北浙江路口、我們正在對一位小姐募錢的時候、而旁邊來了一位似工人模樣的同胞、問我（您們是不是為馬將軍募餉、）我說（是的、）他即將白白底三塊大洋、一塊一塊的投入我的竹筒、我看他檻褸的衣服、誠懇的態度、不禁使我感動得淚下、經我一問、才知道他是老閘橋青菜行裏的雜行、</p>
<p>我們在大馬路一帶募了一點鍾光景、預備搭五路電車到北站不料那位頭等座裏的買票先生（我們大中華民國的同胞）、對我說、（這是法蘭西的電車、不能募捐的、）我即答曰、（我有錢買票、）那位大中華民國的主人先生却回答道、（你有錢、請一府上去買票吧、）他那冷酷的面部表情、眞使我血湧、我再也沒有和他理直的勇氣了、</p>
<p>這一次我自梵皇渡出發、經愚園路靜安寺路赫德路愛文義路而至大馬路、結果共募到大洋三元小洋七十馀角和銅元若干枚、晚上旋校、見以抗日會的馬部因內無糧外缺援而全軍覆沒的消息、不禁痛哭、鳴呼、中華、我可愛的中華、</p>

<h3>Ma Zhanshan Leads Troops to Arrive at Hailun</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Occupy Qiqihar Road and Continue to Advance on Ma's Troops. League of Nations Administrative Council Discusses Sending an Investigative Mission. Fourth Plenary Session of the National Congress Resolves to Convene a National Crisis Conference</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Establishes Provincial Government in Hailun</h3>
<p>Three Thousand Japanese Troops Pursue Ma's Forces. Zhang Xueliang Orders Ma to Continue Preparing Defenses. Qiqihar Road Entirely Occupied by Japanese. South Manchuria Railway Sends Personnel to Repair the Tao'ang Road Tracks.</p>
<p>(Harbin) Ma Zhanshan led his troops to Hailun on the 21st evening and immediately established a provincial government there. Hailun is at the extreme end of the Hu-Hai Road, in the eastern Hei-Fu area. Ma Zhanshan is reorganizing his remaining forces but lacks funds, and urgently hopes for assistance from the people of the country. The Hei army has not received its pay for three months, and the soldiers are in dire straits. Japanese troops have completely occupied the Qiqihar Road. From the 22nd, employees of the South Manchuria Railway office are acting as road officials and opening the road to traffic. The Japanese army is determined to eliminate the Hei army, and on the 21st dispatched a cavalry artillery brigade, bypassing Hailun from Zhongxing Town, intending to prevent the Hei provincial government from being established in that direction. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Various groups in Harbin and Hei do not diminish their respect for the Hei army because of its retreat. On the 21st, several groups went to Hailun to offer condolences. When the Hei army retreated, three hundred wounded soldiers remained in the Ang'angxi Hospital, unable to be transported away. For two days, no one cared for them. Now, the Harbin Red Swastika Society and several other groups have formed a nursing team to provide relief. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) More than five hundred railway workers from the South Manchuria Railway arrived on the Tao'ang Road on the 21st to repair the tracks, with the aim of opening the road to traffic on the first of next month. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Harbin telegram, a large contingent of Japanese troops has advanced south of the Chinese Eastern Railway, leaving approximately two thousand troops in the city and various ports. Three thousand troops have been dispatched to Qiqihar Road to continue pursuing Ma's army, mainly consisting of mechanized units and cavalry. After arriving in Keshan on the 21st, Ma Zhanshan issued a circular announcing the relocation of the provincial government. It was secretly intercepted in Harbin. Keshan currently has no radio station, and remittances are also impossible. The Japanese army continues to pursue Ma, intending to seize all railways in the Northeast. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Vice Zhang received two telegrams from Ma Zhanshan yesterday, reporting that Japanese troops had occupied Hei province and that he had led the Shao troops, retreating to the Hailun, Baiquan, and Keshan area. Personnel from both the military and administrative offices, as well as the party headquarters, have temporarily relocated to Hailun to await further orders. Zhang replied by telegram to Ma Zhanshan on the 22nd, ordering him to reorganize his troops at their current location and continue preparing defenses to defend the national territory and plan for future actions. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to Chinese sources, Ma Zhanshan's main force is currently assembled at Keshan, and all military supplies have been moved there. According to Japanese sources, neither Qiqihar nor the Chinese Eastern Railway have been damaged by the war. Zhang Jinghui is scheduled to go to Qiqihar tomorrow to assume the post of chairman of Hei province. Harbin is currently quiet. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to an announcement from the headquarters of Commander Honjo, when the Chinese soldiers withdrew from Qiqihar, they destroyed the windows and stoves in the barracks. Many Japanese soldiers now housed there have suffered frostbite. Furthermore, Japanese soldiers have no time to eat during combat, which greatly reduces their ability to withstand the cold. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Jinghui's Trip to Hei Province Still Pending</h3>
<p>Domen Representative Holds Secret Talks with Zhang</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Jinghui's trip to Hei province is a matter of face. Zhao Zhongren, a member of the Hei provincial committee, and others will lead representatives from various sectors to invite him. Zhao is returning to Hei today. Zhang is awaiting his arrival and has not departed today. Changes in the leadership of the Special Region and other officials must await agreement between Xi Qia and Zhang Jinghui. Xi will come to Harbin in the coming days. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 1:00 AM on the 21st, a Japanese army major arrived in Harbin with orders from the division commander of the Hei Garrison, conveyed them to Consul Ohashi, and met with Zhang Jinghui for lengthy secret talks. The Japanese consul in Harbin, Ohashi, has already assumed the role of host. Today, he summoned reporters from the Harbin White Russian newspaper to lecture them. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Xi Qia plans to take over the Northeast Navigation Bureau and has sent personnel to Harbin to discuss it with Jinghui. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Many slogans denouncing a certain leading figure in the Special Region have been discovered here, including the inflammatory words, "The people should rise up and beat this old traitor to death." (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xie Zongxia, secretary of the Northeast Administrative Office in Harbin, and others, telegraphed Gao Weiche, acting president of the Military Council, reporting that Zhang Jinghui had not yet gone to Hei province. The confidential telegram has been presented to Marshal Zhang. An investigation revealed that when Chairman Ma retreated from Jiang province, gentry and merchants from all walks of life dispatched dozens of representatives, including Zhao Zhongren and Li Yaqiao, to implore Marshal Zhang to go and clean up the mess and save the people. Marshal Zhang then stated that the Harbin area is an international commercial center, and the security situation is extremely important. How could he leave it arbitrarily for a day? He immediately politely declined. Reports stating that the Japanese side was forcing him and that he left Harbin on the 20th are all false rumors. We respectfully report this. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Haipeng's Troops and the Japanese Army in Fierce Battle at Wumiaozhi</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Haipeng and the Taonan National Salvation Army joined forces and occupied Zhendong on the evening of the 21st, engaging in fierce battle with the Japanese army at Wumiaozhi. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>One Company of Japanese Troops Arrived in Xinmin Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Bandit Activities Rampant in Panshan and Other Areas</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Jinzhou, at 6:00 AM on the 22nd, one company of Japanese troops arrived in Xinmin from Shenyang, along with three hundred boxes of ammunition. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bandit activities are rampant in Panshan, Beizhen, Bajiaotai, and other areas. Many residents are fleeing along the railway towards Shanhaiguan. Leaflets in both Chinese and Japanese are frequently found at Yingkou and stations east of Jinzhou, disavowing all facilities of the Liaoning Provincial Government established in Jinzhou. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinzhou) This afternoon, we received reliable information that a Japanese armored train arrived in Xinmin this morning. Xinmin is on the Beining Railway, 30 miles from Shenyang. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Discusses Investigative Mission Proposal</h3>
<p>Creating a Situation that Oppresses Our Country</p>
<p>Ariyoshi's Proposal Largely Agreed Upon by Directors</p>
<p>General Intent is to Use This to Step Down</p>
<p>Briand is Drafting a Resolution</p>
<p>Ariyoshi Declares Disapproval of Ceasefire</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Demands Immediate Withdrawal of Japanese Troops</p>
<p>(Paris) The Council held a public meeting at 4:30 PM today and adjourned at 6:15 PM. Ariyoshi presented a proposal to send a neutral investigative committee. Most directors agreed. The Chinese delegation refused to agree to sending an investigative committee without a special guarantee of troop withdrawal. Dr. Shi repeatedly protested, but the directors intended to use this to step down. Finally, the chairman of the Third Special Meeting, Briand, stated that he would draft a resolution on the investigative committee and present it at the next public meeting, which will likely be on Monday. Then, Dr. Shi declared that whether or not an investigative mission is sent, the withdrawal of Japanese troops should begin immediately. The Council's urgent task is to supervise the Japanese troop withdrawal. Shi then formally rejected any proposal for an investigative committee without the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Ariyoshi replied that Japan would immediately withdraw its troops once the safety of Japanese residents' lives and property in Manchuria was effectively guaranteed. Shi stated that the Chinese people deeply respect Mr. Briand's efforts for peace, but the Chinese government does not see sending an investigative mission as an excuse for Japan not to immediately withdraw its troops. When the Council meeting opened at 4:30 PM today, Japanese representative Ariyoshi was talking with Cecil, looking serious. Dr. Shi was consulting with Briand. British representative Cecil spoke first, followed by Briand, who made a brief speech stating that the Council had been striving for a peaceful resolution of the crisis in the Three Eastern Provinces since the last public meeting, and detailed the situation from the perspectives of China and Japan. He said that all the Council's efforts must be based on Article 11 of the Charter and the resolution unanimously passed on September 30th. Ambassador Ariyoshi had strongly stated that Japan had no intention of occupying territory in China, and Dr. Shi had also provided assurances of the safety of Japanese residents' lives and property during the troop withdrawal. The Council had clarified several unclear points in the past week, which could be considered a slight achievement. Finally, he asked the Chinese and Japanese representatives to consider the overall situation and abide by proposals that could end the dispute, and refrain from words and actions that could aggravate the situation. After Briand finished speaking, Ariyoshi began to speak at 4:45 PM. Ariyoshi stated that Japan valued the Council's efforts to mediate the dispute and solemnly declared that the Japanese government was determined to abide by the letter and spirit of the September 30th resolution and was still prepared to withdraw its troops with minimal delay, but could not agree to a ceasefire, because the military actions in the Three Eastern Provinces were not a war. A ceasefire at this time would only allow China to mobilize 200,000 troops and hinder the Japanese army's self-defense against bandits. He then enumerated various accusations against China, emphasized that Japan had important interests in Manchuria, and proposed sending an investigative mission, saying that the mission should also investigate the important interests of Japanese residents and that the mission must not interfere in direct negotiations between China and Japan, nor interfere in Japanese military operations. Finally, he said that the dispatch of the mission would not affect the Japanese government's determination to withdraw its troops, nor was it related to the troop withdrawal. Dr. Shi then rose to reiterate China's position, saying that Japan's military occupation of the Northeast violated justice, violated the League of Nations Charter, and was the root cause of the dispute and the crux of the situation. China could not bargain for the safety and freedom of its people. China could not tolerate any resolution that considered the issue of troop withdrawal, regardless of the time frame. Any proposal that did not stipulate an immediate cessation of all military actions and troop withdrawal could not be presented as a solution to this problem. The Japanese troop withdrawal should begin immediately and be continuously implemented in the shortest possible time, as circumstances allow. The Chinese government could not negotiate the troop withdrawal or agree to the troop withdrawal except by agreeing on the details to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in the withdrawal area. While we sit here debating, China is in deep water and burning heat. China urgently needs the League of Nations to provide various remedies based on Article 11 or other articles of the Charter. German representative Mertes (Puro had returned to Berlin) began to debate, saying that it was regrettable that the situation in the Three Eastern Provinces had become worse despite the efforts of the League of Nations. The world was deeply disappointed that the League of Nations had not made progress so far and hoped that it could be resolved satisfactorily. The German government fully agreed with the proposal to send an investigative mission. British representative Cecil said that the Council must decide whether this proposal was feasible or not. He believed that the Council must know the truth of what was happening in the Three Eastern Provinces at this time, so he asked the directors to study the Japanese proposal and asked Ariyoshi to explain his proposal further. Ariyoshi</p>

<p>said that Viscount Cecil had already explained Japan's views, thinking that studying the basic situation in the Three Eastern Provinces was an urgent task. This was the spirit of what the British representative wanted to examine. Dr. Shi then rose to refute Ariyoshi, stressing that the Council's main issue was the withdrawal of Japanese troops in proportion to the security provided by China. The Chinese government was willing to cooperate when the directors studied the Japanese proposal, but China would definitely provide amendments. China could not accept any proposal unless it was sure of its true meaning. He asked the Council to always remember China's position. Cecil continued, saying that he believed that there were now several neutral investigators in the Three Eastern Provinces who could collect and report to the Council. The representatives of France, Italy, Poland, Yugoslavia, Norway, Guatemala, Peru, and Panama all indicated that they accepted the investigative mission plan. Briand then rose and said that the investigative mission plan had actually been approved by the Council. He now proposed to proceed with the selection of committee members and asked for immediate study of their terms of reference and size. He acknowledged that Dr. Shi had reserved the right to raise objections, but for the time being he asked China to accept this proposal and said that the world still trusted the League of Nations' ability to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute, and cited dozens of telegrams from various places encouraging the League of Nations' efforts for peace as evidence. Dr. Shi then reiterated that China valued Briand's efforts to maintain peace, but the Chinese government must reject the investigative mission proposal if there was no guarantee of troop withdrawal and stressed that the current problem was troop withdrawal. Then, Briand said that once the Japanese proposal was studied, he would draft a resolution and submit it to the next public meeting, hoping that this resolution would be the basis for future negotiations. Dr. Shi also made a final statement as mentioned above, because Shi was aware that the investigative committee plan might be an excuse to delay the troop withdrawal, so when the meeting adjourned, he firmly stated that he rejected the investigative committee proposal without a guarantee of troop withdrawal. As for the guarantee of Japanese troop withdrawal obtained by the Council so far, it was still no different from two months ago. Before the meeting today, Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira met with US Ambassador Dawes at 2:20 PM. The Chinese delegation had received a report that Japanese troops were preparing to invade Keshan. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a public meeting today and accepted the Japanese proposal to send a mission to Manchuria and China to conduct on-site investigations, believing that it was the best and most stable way to end the Sino-Japanese dispute that was causing the current dangerous situation in Manchuria. The detailed measures have not yet been decided. Japan claimed that the mission should not affect military operations, and China claimed that the organization of the mission must not be regarded as an excuse to delay the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, but public opinion believed that the views of both sides were not irreconcilable. Chairman Briand believed that the presence of a mission on the ground could have a great impact on stabilizing the atmosphere, which was the consensus of everyone. It is now hoped that the Administrative Council can formulate proposals on the investigation team that are acceptable to both parties. This is the work that the Secretariat of the League of Nations, in conjunction with several important legal scholars such as Simon, is now undertaking. Once the draft is agreed upon, it will be submitted to China and Japan. Once agreed, all future acts of hostility should be stopped. There was no excitement at today's meeting of the Administrative Council. The discussion lasted about two hours and was not intense. The public seemed prepared to take a rational attitude towards this acknowledged great difficulty. The outcome of this meeting will definitely be a major step towards a permanent solution to the Manchuria problem. The Administrative Council's public meeting began at 4:40 PM. Before the meeting hall was opened, the audience had already gathered. By the time the members of the Administrative Council arrived, the seats for diplomats and journalists had been filled half an hour earlier. At 4:30, Chairman Briand arrived first, followed by Ariyoshi with a cigar, and British representative Cecil arrived last. Briand reported on the general situation, saying that the Administrative Council had been seeking a peaceful solution to this problem based on Article 11 of the League of Nations Charter since the last meeting. The power of the Administrative Council's resolution of September 30th was still in effect. The Administrative Council must do its best to find appropriate methods to implement the provisions of the resolution. Briand then turned to the Chinese and Japanese representatives to ask for their opinions, but asked them to limit their speeches to suggestions for ending the current situation. Ariyoshi spoke first, saying that Japan was completely abiding by the resolution of September 30th in spirit and letter, but China had publicly declared a unilateral policy of abolishing treaties and was implementing a public anti-foreign movement, wanting to deny the rights legally obtained by Japanese and Korean residents in Manchuria and to deny the results of their hard work. Therefore, he suggested that a mission should be sent under the auspices of the League of Nations to collect impartial information on the current situation on the ground. The mission should not have the right to interfere in Sino-Japanese negotiations or monitor military operations. Based on these conditions, Japan was prepared to withdraw its troops from the railway area as soon as possible. Japan had already withdrawn some soldiers. He expected that the proposal to send a mission would be welcomed and accepted by all members of the Administrative Council, but the organization and dispatch of the mission should not interfere with or change Japan's views.</p>
<p>Dr. Shi replied that Japan's occupation of Chinese territory and destruction of the solemn treaties and the League of Nations Charter were the key points of the situation. No matter what proposal was made, it could not be a solution to the situation if it did not stipulate an immediate cessation of military actions and an immediate start to the withdrawal of Japanese troops within a very short period of time. The Chinese government could not have any room for consultation on the withdrawal of Japanese troops, in other words, it could not agree to the withdrawal of Japanese troops with any other conditions attached other than agreeing on the details to ensure the safety of lives and property in the area to be withdrawn. China was prepared to take full responsibility for the order in Manchuria outside the South Manchuria Railway area and the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents. If further guarantees were required, reasonable measures involving the cooperation of neutral countries under the auspices of the League of Nations could also be accepted by China. The problem was quite simple, and the time to deal with it had come, because if there was only debate, the suffering would increase and there would be irreparable losses. Delaying it would only make the work more difficult. In order to ensure the rapid and complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese territory, China requested the Administrative Council to grant China all the rights and remedies that it could demand as a member under Article 11 of the Charter. Cecil then joined the discussion, saying that the Administrative Council was very keen to study in detail Japan's proposal regarding the mission. The British government had always felt that there was a need for a way to seek accurate knowledge of the Manchuria incident. If this step of sending personnel to investigate had been taken in September, the British government would have been even more pleased. Ariyoshi interjected, saying that the Japanese government believed that the investigation should not be limited to Manchuria, but should also be carried out within Chinese territory. Dr. Shi then rose and said that the Administrative Council's resolution of September 30th stipulated that information should be collected on the ground by neutral people. He did not know whether neutral people had been sent to Nenjiang and Qiqihar. The key point that the Administrative Council had to deal with now was the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of troops. When he spoke of the mission, he did not mean that he could wait for the organization of the mission before submitting a reform plan, nor did he mean that he could accept a plan about which he knew nothing. Cecil replied that there was a British representative in Ang'angxi. Dr. Shi thanked him for his clear reply and asked whether the information collected by neutral people in Manchuria could be made available to the members of the committee. German representative Mertes said that information must be obtained before appropriate conclusions could be drawn. The mission was not going to China to determine responsibility or investigate past events, but to end the serious situation that was endangering the world. The fate of the League of Nations was at stake. The League of Nations did not want to ask both parties to abandon their interests. The problem now was to seek an equal solution to end the situation that closely resembled war. The Chinese representative had not completely rejected the Japanese proposal. He was pleased that both countries were still working towards a solution and should not allow hesitation to hinder its progress. Spanish representative Lele welcomed the Japanese representative's proposal and said that the Japanese government's determination to implement the Administrative Council's resolution of September 30th, its commencement of the withdrawal of its troops, and its declaration that it had no territorial ambitions were noble attitudes. Italian representative Xie Lejia said that the Italian government was willing to provide the Administrative Council with all the facilities it had in Manchuria to facilitate the investigation. Polish representative Chaileski said that the Polish government was willing to support all plans that could restore peace and good understanding. The Yugoslav representative accepted the proposal to send personnel to Manchuria to investigate, and the representatives of Norway, Guatemala, and Panama also agreed with the proposal. Chairman Briand summarized the discussion, saying that the mission in the proposal would definitely stabilize the local situation and create a calm situation. What the Administrative Council was seeking was not a temporary solution, but a permanent solution. Dr. Shi then made a speech praising Briand and said that the Chinese government and people were working hard to calm the situation so as not to make Briand's work more difficult. Although China did not oppose the mission as a tool for seeking knowledge of the situation, the Chinese government would never agree to the establishment of this mission being an excuse for delaying the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops. China wanted to stop the war and withdraw Japanese troops, and could not agree to any proposal other than this. Ariyoshi replied that the Japanese government was prepared to withdraw its troops when the situation effectively guaranteed the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents. The Japanese government was now working on the issue of improving the local situation, but there were still many crises. He also said that he had only briefly outlined the main points of the Japanese government's proposal regarding the mission and would add details later. Briand concluded the meeting, saying that the Administrative Council would study the Japanese proposal and that he hoped that it could draft a proposal on this issue that could be accepted by all. When there was sufficient progress, a meeting would be convened again. Briand then said to Dr. Shi that he had heard that China was prepared to accept the proposal if the mission did not hinder China's major interests. He believed that the mere appearance of this mission could have a great effect on stabilizing the atmosphere, but hostile acts must not occur again before the mission was organized and its duties were exercised. Therefore, he believed that it was necessary to find a way to prevent any events from disrupting the peace. He was sure that Dr. Shi would know the need for cooperative efforts after obtaining the information he deserved about the mission. As for the number of people, tasks, and scope of the mission, and how to report, the Administrative Council still relied on the joint study of the Chinese and Japanese representatives. The meeting then ended at 6:25 PM. The representatives felt slightly relieved when they left the meeting, but they only expected to obtain a solution and knew that there were still thorns ahead in the negotiations, and that the work of drafting a proposal that could be accepted by China and Japan was not easy. It was expected that there would be much activity behind the scenes before the proposal was finalized, and the next public meeting would be held around Tuesday or Wednesday.

<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Sir Simon has returned to Paris at 11:15 PM last night and will assist the Secretariat of the League of Nations in the arduous work of drafting a resolution on the organization and dispatch of an international mission to China in the next day or two. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The misunderstanding regarding the Manchuria case (ceasefire) has been eliminated. Today, the attention of the government and the public is focused on the investigative mission issue. However, because the Chinese representative is still opposed to this proposal, the atmosphere of the political world is gloomy. Japan's claim to limit the scope of activities of the investigative mission is said to be to ensure that the mission is not appointed by the League of Nations authorized by Article 15 of the League of Nations Charter, so as not to base its duties on that article. A Reuters reporter learned that it has been suggested that the mission should be organized by international jurists, military experts, and business leaders. Britain would be represented by a well-known lawyer, France by a military expert, and the United States by a business leader. China and Japan would be allowed to send personnel as assistants.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Actually Accepts the Japanese Investigation Team's Recommendations?!</h3>
<p>News has recently arrived from Paris that is extremely surprising, worrying, and even more bewildering to us. That is, at the League of Nations Council's open meeting on the 21st, it was decided to accept the recommendations of the extremely cunning Japanese-organized Manchurian Investigation Team and dispatch a commission to Manchuria for investigation. The Council representatives all regard sending a commission for investigation as a method to resolve the Northeast issue. Although Envoy Shi expressed that he could not accept it unless Japan withdrew its troops, he was ultimately unable to reverse their firm stance. After hearing this news, we can immediately conclude that the resolution of the Council on October 24, which required the Japanese army to withdraw first, has been completely overturned. Furthermore, the recent discussions regarding the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant have been completely swept away. We cannot but acknowledge that the League of Nations' spirit and attitude of safeguarding peace and upholding justice have succumbed to violence and have shown a sudden change.</p>
<p>We still remember that the proposal to organize the Manchurian Investigation Team had already been put forward at the second meeting of the League of Nations, and China had expressed its agreement, while Japan had sternly rejected it. Because of Japan's rejection, the League of Nations withdrew this proposal at the second meeting. Now, based on Japan's recommendation, the League of Nations is happily complying and regards it as the only way to resolve the Northeast issue. We do not want to say more about Japan's arrogance, unreasonableness, and inconsistency. However, we do not understand why the League of Nations takes Japan's proposals as its own and has no ability to maintain its own credibility. This is one thing we do not understand.</p>
<p>The sound of cannons in Qiqihar could not arouse the attention of the League of Nations. The attack on Jinzhou also failed to attract the League of Nations' concern. Since September 18, all the persecutions and atrocities inflicted on our country by the Japanese army, as well as the forcible occupation of our territory, the destruction of our sovereignty, and the instigation of independence in the Northeast, all ironclad facts, have not been able to prove that Japan is disrupting peace and betraying the Covenant. Then, what else can be used as proof? What exactly can the investigation team investigate and want to investigate? This is the second thing we do not understand.</p>
<p>Since the League of Nations has decided to send a commission to Manchuria for investigation, the League of Nations should bear absolute responsibility for the results of this investigation and the aftermath of the investigation. In other words, this investigation should represent the League of Nations, not a certain country, and certainly not an individual. Now, the League of Nations has not only approved the dispatch of a commission to Manchuria for investigation but also endorsed the Norwegian representative's suggestion that the investigating country should be considered a representative of an individual rather than a country. If the investigating country can only represent an individual, then its power is as light as a feather, and its effect is as insignificant as dust. Even if the investigation yields some results, it is equivalent to no investigation. Why should the League of Nations go to such lengths, burdening the investigating commissioners to travel long distances? This is the third thing we do not understand.</p>
<p>Japanese representative Yoshizawa not only proposed the recommendation of an investigation team but also, on the other hand, the Japanese government put forward: (1) Investigation commissioners must not comment on the actions of the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces. (2) If there are Sino-Japanese negotiations in the area, the commissioners must not interfere. (3) The commissioners must not only investigate Manchuria but also investigate and ascertain the chaotic situation in other parts of China. At the same time, it also firmly denied all its atrocities as acts of war and claimed that they were only for self-defense and declared that it would never accept the proposal of a ceasefire. If the investigation commissioners cannot comment on the actions of the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces, and the investigation is limited to China, then the fairness of the investigation has been completely deprived, making it impossible to exercise power. If the commissioners cannot interfere in Sino-Japanese negotiations, then the investigation is absolutely unnecessary. As for the situation in various parts of China, regardless of whether it is chaotic or orderly, it is an internal affair of China and has nothing to do with the League of Nations or Japan. If the so-called chaotic situation refers to the anti-Japanese goods movement, then this movement was entirely provoked by Japanese atrocities. The enthusiasm of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese movement is the counter-evidence of Japanese atrocities and also the patriotic behavior of the Chinese people's peaceful self-defense. The League of Nations has no right to investigate. The Japanese put forward these three conditions, as well as the more obvious opposition to a ceasefire, and their lack of sincerity in the investigation proposal has been fully exposed. If the three restrictions proposed by Japan are true, how will the investigation team exercise its power? If Japan's declaration of opposing a ceasefire is true, then its atrocities will not only not stop but can also be expanded at any time. If the League of Nations' investigation team is conducting its investigation work in Manchuria, and the Japanese army suddenly expands its war actions under the pretext of self-defense or other excuses, we cannot predict how the League of Nations' investigation team will report back. How will the League of Nations maintain its credibility? All these crises are numerous. Japan's diplomatic cunning and insidiousness are known without the need for the wise. However, the League of Nations is extremely optimistic about this recommendation, considering it the only way to resolve the Northeast issue. This is the fourth thing we do not understand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the prerequisite for resolving the Northeast issue and easing the serious situation at present is to withdraw the Japanese army first. Only after the Japanese army withdraws can other issues be considered. Otherwise, it would be using force to threaten China to sign an alliance under duress, which China cannot recognize. The League of Nations had already advised the withdrawal of the Japanese army at the first meeting. At the second meeting, there was a solemn resolution that the Japanese army must withdraw as soon as possible before November 24. However, today, the League of Nations has been secretly negotiating for many days, not mentioning the withdrawal of troops but talking about investigation, not looking back at the motions of the first and second meetings, but overturning them all. The League of Nations never looks back on the Japanese representative's repeated promises to withdraw troops. The League of Nations turns a deaf ear to the Chinese representative's repeated statements and demands. If the League of Nations acknowledges that its decision today is correct, then it should declare that its previous decisions were wrong. If it acknowledges that Japan's atrocities are correct, then it should declare that China's requests are incorrect. If it acknowledges that Japan's betrayal of the alliance and breaking of its word are correct, then it should declare that China's observance of the Covenant and obedience to justice are incorrect. The two must be one. In other words, the League of Nations should never have two spirits and two contradictory attitudes. However, based on the facts shown today, it is actually trapped in a contradiction. This is the fifth thing we do not understand.</p>
<p>These five incomprehensions increase the infinite worries and fears of the Chinese people. We cannot but acknowledge that the League of Nations' attitude has suddenly changed, and the League of Nations' mask has been completely torn off. Alas!</p>

<h3>Zhu Zhaoxin　　　　Releases Diplomatic Remarks</h3>
<p>Came to Nanjing from Guangdong to attend the Special Foreign Affairs Committee</p>

Mr. Zhu once served as the ambassador to the United Kingdom and Italy and concurrently served as the chief representative of China to the League of Nations. His views on the issue with Japan are expected to attract the attention of Chinese and foreign public opinion. (Reporter asked) Japan still insists on negotiating first and then withdrawing troops. Will our country make concessions? (Zhu replied) The withdrawal of troops is a natural matter and cannot be conceded under any circumstances. (Asked) It is reported that Japan has proposed to the League of Nations to send an investigation team to the three provinces. Is this true? (Answer) According to the organization of the League of Nations resolution, the special committee is designated to monitor the withdrawal of troops and the task of receiving the territory from a neutral country’s representative, which is welcomed by our country. Now, it is said that the nature of the investigation team proposed by Japan is different, and our country cannot agree. (Asked) Japan wants to declare the Sino-Japanese Treaty effective as the price for withdrawing troops. How should our country respond? (Answer) Article 21 of the treaty is resolutely denied by the whole country. How can we declare it and subject ourselves to restrictions? (Asked) The League of Nations has shown a tendency to favor Japan. Will it force our country to accept unsatisfactory conditions in the future? (Answer) If the League of Nations cannot give us a satisfactory mediation, we will have to take action ourselves. (Asked) Why doesn't Representative Shi mention Article 15 of the Covenant? (Answer) It will naturally be proposed when necessary. (Asked) Are the countries willing to impose an economic blockade on Japan in accordance with the provisions of Article 16? (Answer) If the League of Nations has no solution, then the Covenant is equivalent to waste paper, and world peace will not be guaranteed. (Asked) What should we do if Japan continues to advance its troops? (Answer) Japan is still continuing its military operations, which is really disregarding the League of Nations. It is no different from launching a war against us without a declaration. Our side will only respond with self-defense and resistance. Who is the culprit? The world has its own fair judgment. Why should we be suspicious and fearful? (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Japan Brewing Political Upheaval</h3>
<p>Adachi Advocates Forming a Coalition Cabinet</p>
<p>Seiyukai Expresses Non-Cooperation</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japan United, 22nd - Interior Minister Adachi consulted with both directors, Raimu, Tomita, and Secretary-General Yamamichi at noon yesterday regarding important political affairs. After the cabinet meeting adjourned, he received key figures such as Yamamichi, Nakano, and Furuya to exchange views. He issued a statement at 10:30 pm, stating that in order to overcome the current cabinet's difficulties and enhance its strength, it is necessary to follow the trend and organize a coalition cabinet with the cooperation of various political parties.</p>
<p>Another telegram stated that after Interior Minister Adachi advocated the formation of a coalition cabinet, cabinet members such as Machida, Koizumi, Sakurauchi, Watanabe, and Tanaka gathered to decide to consistently support the Wakatsuki cabinet, convene the next Diet session, and nominated Commerce Minister Sakurauchi as their representative to inquire about the Interior Minister's opinion. Unexpectedly, Adachi suddenly issued a statement before any consultation. Therefore, all cabinet members were shocked by Adachi's actions and are currently discussing countermeasures.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japan United, 22nd - Commerce Minister Sakurauchi visited Interior Minister Adachi this morning to question the meaning of the statement issued last night. Adachi replied, "(What I deeply believe is as stated in the statement. I feel that it is best to organize a strong cooperative cabinet based on political parties at this time. If the Seiyukai refuses, I plan to maintain the status quo. If the status quo cannot be maintained, I will take other measures to add some new changes to the current cabinet. Premier Wakatsuki should be aware of this matter himself.)" Both Commerce Minister and Interior Minister agreed. They will subsequently make every effort to communicate opinions to handle the situation well. Commerce Minister Sakurauchi also visited Agriculture Minister Machida to report the situation of the meeting with the Interior Minister and exchanged opinions on the political situation.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Adachi visited Premier Wakatsuki at 2 pm today to explain the process of issuing the statement and his true intentions. He inquired about the Premier's intentions regarding the solutions sought by the Premier from the Interior Minister before the start of the Grand Maneuvers, and urged him to make a decision. He also plans to start formal negotiations with the Seiyukai. It seems that they are exchanging opinions on all preparations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Dentsu, 22nd - Government officials are deeply shocked by Interior Minister Adachi's promotion of a coalition cabinet and his actions. They all say that before the Army University Grand Maneuvers, Adachi urged Premier Wakatsuki to handle the situation well, organize a coalition cabinet with the cooperation of various political parties, and make Inukai, the president, one of the cabinet ministers. Wakatsuki had already agreed to Inukai's entry into the cabinet. When Adachi returned to Tokyo, he insisted on his previous opinion, but the Seiyukai did not approve of Inukai's entry into the cabinet and ridiculed Adachi's actions for not understanding the current situation. Some say that even if the coalition cabinet cannot be realized, when the government and the party's internal movement advance vigorously, Premier Wakatsuki will retire. Therefore, from Adachi's own position, his plan seems to be powerful.</p>
<p>Another telegram stated that regarding the motion for a coalition cabinet, Seiyukai President Inukai Takeshi considered it carefully and believed that the proposal was not appropriate. He decided to adopt a solo approach to the situation. All Seiyukai leaders also expressed their agreement. If Adachi proposes the plan, it will be strongly rejected. It is heard that Inukai will publish his opinion on the 24th. (Dentsu News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japan United, 22nd - The Minseito Party feared that local people would have anxieties about the political situation due to Interior Minister Adachi's statement. This afternoon, Secretary-General Yamamichi came forward and sent a telegram to the members of both houses of the Diet belonging to the party and the Minseito Party branches in various prefectures and counties. The text of the telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>(Today's reports regarding Interior Minister Adachi's statement are nothing more than Interior Minister Adachi expressing his own beliefs and explaining the misunderstandings in the previous conversation before the Grand Maneuvers. There is no cause for concern regarding the political situation. Please rest assured.)</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd - Today, Interior Minister Adachi published a statement advocating the formation of a national government to cope with the serious financial and diplomatic difficulties facing the country. A cabinet upheaval seems to be imminent. Subsequently, Prime Minister Wakatsuki and the Interior Minister exchanged views, and they both believed that the Interior Minister's plan was just in principle, but it was difficult to realize in the current political environment. Adachi's declaration expressed trust in the Minseito Party, and stated that in this serious situation, party differences should be eliminated and the happiness of the country should be the prerequisite. His words have aroused all kinds of speculation from the government and the public. Some predict that a supra-party cabinet will be formed with General Ugaki, Governor-General of Korea, as prime minister, or that the Minseito Party and the Seiyukai will form a coalition cabinet. It is heard that the Seiyukai does not approve of this move. Adachi is one of the most powerful members of the Minseito Party and one of the leaders of the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Advocates Equal Treatment for All Races</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Bombay, 21st - Gandhi expressed his views on racial treatment in London, making the difficulties felt by wealthy Indians even greater than those of European merchants, and these wealthy Indians are all Gandhi's followers. Gandhi advocates that after India's independence, resources should be thoroughly redistributed, so that a cruel conflict will occur between the propertied and the propertyless, and the result will not benefit either Indians or Europeans. As for the general public, Gandhi suggested that the wealthy be forced to distribute their ill-gotten gains to the poor, which is fair in intention. However, in practice, Gandhi's plan is no different from communism. As for British commercial interests, they are even more threatened by Gandhi's plan. Because the British rely on force in India as a talisman, they can enjoy generous privileges, which, in all fairness, have no legitimate name. Gandhi's plan pays attention to this. If unfortunately implemented, British interests will all be questioned. Furthermore, wealthy Indians who are friendly with Gandhi have previously provided assistance to Gandhi's non-resistance movement. Seeing that Gandhi's plan is not conducive to them, they may break with him and no longer provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Germans Invent Vitamin D</h3>

<h3>Trial of Narcotics Trafficking Case Continues</h3>
<p>Supplied That Heroin Was Smuggled in Diplomatic Baggage to China</p>
<p>National News Agency, Basel, 21st - The international drug trafficking case had its second hearing today. The main criminal in the case, the famous chemist Dr. Müller, confessed that he had handed heroin worth 200,000 Swiss francs to a person named Borelra. Dr. Müller refused to explain who he was, but from the words of the lawyer's interrogation, it can be inferred that he seems to be a diplomat who smuggled this heroin from Switzerland into China in his diplomatic baggage. Two other defendants who had also met with Borelra also refused to reveal who Mr. Bo was.</p>

<p>Telegram from Xuchang - To the Shen Bao, the British and American Tobacco Company sent its staff member Ren Bonian to Xuchang in the early years of the Republic of China to purchase more than 90 mu of land along the Pinghan Railway and build houses for storing and baking tobacco. In order to safeguard national rights and resist foreign aggression, our people in Xuchang filed a complaint with the county government and appealed to the provincial government in the eighth year of the Republic of China, seeking the restoration of sovereignty. However, at that time, the warlords colluded with foreigners and perfunctorily dealt with it, and it has not been resolved until now. The company has completed the construction of hundreds of large and small factories and warehouses in Xuchang. All sectors of Xuchang organized the Xuchang National Land Protection Committee and petitioned the government to approve the full recovery. We have now received instructions from the county government and transferred them to the provincial government. Regarding this case, we have already consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for reply. This association will continue to work hard to achieve the goal of recovery as soon as possible. We hope that the compatriots of the whole country will pay close attention and provide assistance. The Xuchang National Land Protection Committee kowtows,</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle on the Taonan-Ang'angxi Railway Line on the 16th</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Asks Harbin for Funds Due to Lack of Pay</p>
<p>Zhang Jinghui Actually Instructs the Banking Community to Refuse</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, The wind was strong on the 16th, and the Taonan-Ang'angxi line had a lot of sand on the plains. Where the wind rose, dust rose several feet high. Our army guarding within the joint line felt quite difficult because of the lack of wind glasses to cover their eyes, and they could not distinguish things in front of them beyond several hundred steps. The wind blew from west to east, and our side was right in its path. The soldiers stood bare in the cold wind and hurricane, without the slightest timidity. At 2:10 p.m., the Japanese army, taking advantage of the wind, first took off from the Tailai side with three planes and circled over our position, inspecting our right wing defense line of Sanjianfang Xiaosanjiazi, where the strength of the troops was thin, and dropped more than 30 heavy bombs. At the same time, more than 2,000 Japanese cavalry, artillery, and infantry launched a large-scale attack, fiercely attacking our Yuan Brigade infantry position. Where the shells landed, sand and smoke mixed together, stirring up several feet. Our army was at a disadvantage, and the soldiers were blinded by the smoke and could not stand in the trenches. The enemy troops also rushed forward with bayonets, with dozens of people in a group, shouting to kill. They had reached the trenches. Our army could not hold on at this point, so the commander ordered them to leave the trenches to meet the enemy. However, due to the slow blinding of dust and sand, the guns and artillery lost their effectiveness, and the two armies fell into melee combat. After mixed combat for about three hours, the enemy and our side had casualties. Later, two companies of our machine gun and pistol shooters found the enemy's dense team and fired more than a dozen shots. The enemy's front line was scattered. At that time, the wind was getting stronger and stronger. The enemy planes were blown by the wind in the air, making it difficult to drive as desired. The artillery power also made it difficult to find targets due to the mixed combat between the two armies. The enemy army lost its cover force and retreated at 3:40 p.m. Our army then returned to the trenches to hold on. After four o'clock, there was no more war on the front line, but from 4 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the 17th, the Japanese army still used a small number of cavalry and infantry to disturb our left and right wings. In order to save bullets, our army did not open fire unless the enemy was close to our trenches, so the enemy did not succeed. At 4 p.m., our army moved the first defense line 20 miles towards Jiangqiao between Daguantun and the river bend because the Daxing Sanjiantun defense line was flat and without obstacles, and the enemy would inevitably break through it if it attacked at any time. At the same time, the second defense line also moved forward more than 10 miles. In addition to the 14 cavalry and infantry regiments on the Taonan-Ang'angxi line, Chairman Ma Zhanshan has now ordered Zhang (Guangwen), Song, Li, Huang, and other four former regimental commanders to recruit old troops and organize them into two brigades, together with the militia, to go to the front to strengthen the defense. These four regimental commanders were all well-known military officers during Wu Junsheng's time. There is a saying in Hei Province that Zhang Regimental Commander fights well, Song Regimental Commander teaches well, Li Regimental Commander leads troops well, and Huang Regimental Commander attacks well. When Ji Wanfulin was the chief of Hei Province, he imprisoned the four regimental commanders due to personal grievances, and the troops under the four regimental commanders were also scattered. Now Ma released them and recruited two brigades. It is expected that they can be formed in a few days. As for the defense of Hei City, because the troops have been transferred to the front, Ma Zhanshan specially ordered the police department to transfer orders to the public security bureaus in the provincial capital to recruit 300 temporary police officers each to take charge of the garrison. However, Hei Province, as a poor area, is resisting a strong enemy alone. Its financial resources have been exhausted, and the central government and Beiping have not provided assistance, resulting in the front's salary and food not being paid for a long time. Even purchasing supplies for the horses is a difficult task. For this reason, Ma Zhanshan sent personnel to Harbin to contact the banking community for a loan of one million yuan. The banking community asked Zhang Jinghui about this, and Zhang instructed them to refuse. Therefore, the financial resources of Hei Province are now exhausted and there is no assistance. The only piece of national territory that we have fortunately preserved is feared that it will eventually be plundered by the Japanese army. At present, the advance team of the 8th Mixed Brigade sent by the Japanese army from Korea, two regiments, has arrived in Fushun and will be transferred to Taonan during the day. It is predicted that there will be a fierce battle on the Taonan-Ang'angxi line in a few days. By then, the Japanese side's new forces will arrive, and the strength of the troops will increase to about 20,000, plus the power of the air force. The future of our loyal and brave Hei army is quite worrying. Suddenly, a joyful event occurred today. The Nenjiang Iron Bridge was repaired by the Japanese army with wood on the 15th and test driven on the same day, proving it to be strong. The destroyed part of the bridge was 14 holes on the south end and 7 holes on the north end. The entire bridge had 64 holes and was originally built of steel. The Japanese army is now repairing it with wood, thinking that the construction is solid. Now (</p>

<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>17th) At 8 a.m., they planned to transport a large number of troops across the river to attack us. First, at 8:05 a.m., a plane flew to our defense line to scout whether our army was moving. It returned to report immediately. Then, a train of armored cars, carrying ammunition cars, etc., a total of 51 cars, loaded with countless military supplies, 12 field guns, more than 400 horses, and more than 1,000 infantry and artillerymen from the 74th and 79th regiments of the Nagatani Brigade, departed from Tailai to Jiangqiao. At 8:15 a.m., they crossed the river. When they reached the north end and were about to cross the bridge, the wooden bridge was unable to bear the weight and suddenly broke four holes with a loud noise. As a result, the locomotive first fell into the river, and each section of the train was also pulled into the river. The sound at that time was like a mountain collapsing, and it could be heard dozens of miles away. The bridge was 39 meters high, and the bottom of the river was deep and wide. Many of the vehicles, people, and horses were crushed to powder, and the water turned red. The Japanese soldiers guarding the river urgently reported to the Japanese army division headquarters in Tailai. The division commander Domon and others rushed to see, but could not find a way to rescue them. It is heard that the Japanese army has sent hundreds of workers to salvage the river tonight. It is expected that the details of this matter will be known tomorrow. Recently, Japanese residents in Harbin have ordered thousands of sets of Chinese clothes in major commercial centers and set a deadline for delivery. It is not known what the intention is. It is heard that Honjo Shigeru has also sent his representative, Hayashi Yoshihide, to Harbin to instruct Zhang Jinghui to send a letter to Ma Zhanshan, persuading Ma to peacefully cede Hei City. It is not yet known whether Zhang has sent the letter. However, in recent days, a group of shameless military and political figures in Hei Province have secretly come to Harbin to negotiate conditions with the Japanese side, seeking ways to overthrow Ma Zhanshan's chairmanship. They are rushing back and forth and engaging in activities everywhere. Those who are in charge of the matter are Zhao Zhongren, the commissioner of Hei Province, Cuan Lianfang, the chief of the police department, and Shi Qingshan, the former commander of the 22nd Cavalry Brigade of the Northeast. They enter and exit the North Manchuria Hotel every day and meet with the Japanese consul Shimizu and Hayashi Yoshihide to negotiate very closely. Although the Harbin newspaper has repeatedly exposed their affairs, Zhao and others are shameless and still do what they want, and regard themselves as the second Zhao Xinbo and Yuan Xinkai. The only one who defends the territory is Ma Zhanshan, and there are countless traitors. Even if the Hei Bureau is not destroyed by the Japanese army's cannons and planes, it is feared that it will also be destroyed by these scum. (Evening of the 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plot to Seize Harbin</h3>
<p>Kwantung Army Headquarters Sends Personnel to Harbin to Carry Out Activities</p>
<p>Pressuring All Sectors Not to Console the Hei Army</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, The Japanese have never forgotten their intention to seize Heilongjiang and Harbin after occupying Liaoning and Jilin. In the beginning, they only intended to intimidate them slightly, and the Hei army would flee at the sound of the wind, and they could safely occupy Longjiang. Harbin is just an isolated bullet, and they are not worried that it will not fall into their grasp. The entire Three Eastern Provinces have become a single color, and even Soviet Russia has no way to make excuses. Unexpectedly, General Ma Zhanshan was determined to defend the national territory and actually resisted the Japanese army for more than ten days. Therefore, the Japanese conspiracy was greatly affected. Recently, the Japanese, seeing that Heilongjiang is difficult to conquer in a day or two, and if they wait to take Harbin after conquering Hei with all their strength, they are deeply afraid that there will be many changes at night, and Harbin may have other changes. Therefore, they are doing their best to plot the reaction of Harbin. On the 13th, a Japanese man named Nakamachi Henmi, carrying an important mission from the Japanese Kwantung Army, came to Harbin to visit various agencies and do his best to carry out activities. On the 14th, another Japanese man named Daikaku, holding a letter of introduction from a certain important person in Shenyang, went straight to the Binjiang City Chamber of Commerce and asked to see the president of the association. The standing committee member of the association, Wang Danshi, came out to meet him. After the Japanese man sat down, he said, "The people of the Northeast have been under the oppression of the old regime for a long time. Now the empire has come to rescue them because of its brotherly relationship with the Chinese people. The people of China and Japan should not be divided by international borders and should implement the Great Harmony Doctrine. If you are interested, our commander will definitely do his best to help." After speaking, he took out a copy of the articles of association of the Asian Dawn Association from his sleeve and gave it to Wang, the general meaning of which was to promote the German favor of the Japanese and hope that the Chinese people would decide for themselves. Wang did not make any statement at that time, and the Japanese man left the articles of association and left. Also, Chuan Juchuan, the president of the Harbin Shandong Fellow Association, has a good reputation and is very old. The Japanese thought he could be fooled. On the 13th, they also sent two Japanese men who knew Chuan to bewitch him, saying that as long as Chuan lent his name, the Japanese side would be responsible for all difficulties. After the event, the Japanese side would never let him down. If he agreed, he would be asked to make a statement on the current situation in some name, and the Japanese army would come to Harbin to protect him immediately. Fortunately, Chuan was not moved and entrusted a certain newspaper to publish this matter. On the one hand, the Japanese also used the excuse that all sectors of Harbin have recently donated money to comfort the Hei army, saying that it obviously contains suspicion of helping the war, and protested to the office of the diplomatic commissioner stationed in Harbin, saying that they would be banned immediately, otherwise the Japanese side would interfere immediately. Our side is preparing to reply. Also, the Harbin Japanese Residents' Association held a secret meeting on the 14th. It is heard that the content was to discuss the attitude that the Japanese should take after the Japanese army arrived in Harbin. (16th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Party Department Urges Chiang to Go North to Face the Crisis</h3>
<p>To Chairman Chiang, telegram: Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government of Nanjing, it is with great sorrow that the Japanese bandits are invading, and the disaster is pressing day by day, attacking and occupying our territory, and trampling on our sovereignty. Our side has actually adopted a policy of non-resistance, causing Liaoning and Jilin to fall one after another, and the situation in the Northeast has changed darkly. Fortunately, Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang is standing tall as a pillar, defending the borders. However, he is fighting hard with an isolated army, and there is no way to provide assistance. The violent Japanese are attacking with all their strength, and our army is retreating after reorganizing. Qiqihar has fallen into enemy hands again. When the news came, all the people cried bitterly. We are the fish and meat on the chopping board. If we do not resist for a long time, we will just sit and wait for death. Comrade, you bear the heavy responsibility of the party and the country, and are entrusted by the people. It is your duty to bear the great responsibility. I dare to hope that you will lead the troops and go north to face the crisis and help the danger. It is not your responsibility alone. We look forward to your arrival. I hereby present my sincere feelings and hope for your consideration. The Jiangsu Provincial Executive and Supervisory Committee kowtows,</p>
<p>Order to Lower-Level Party Departments: In the course of the Japanese aggression and occupation of our Northeast by force, it has been two months since the International League of Nations meeting twice resolved to order the withdrawal of troops. Not only does he care, but the state of war is becoming more and more obvious. The League of Nations, which upholds justice and maintains world peace, will also tend to succumb to force. At this critical moment, if our Chinese nation wants to survive, it has no choice but to defend itself. The Fourth National Congress passed a resolution on (defending national rights, protecting the national territory,) and (Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government should go north immediately, and the representatives of this congress should also make up their minds to go to the country's crisis). The whole country admires it. Chairman Chiang is loyal, brave, and insightful, and is admired by the country. Judging from past events, he will surely kill the enemy and achieve results and restore our rivers and mountains, which can be expected in a snap of the fingers. For this reason, the party department should immediately telegraph Chairman Chiang to quickly go north to kill the enemy, and hold a farewell rally for Chairman Chiang to go north to save the country, wishing victory in advance to boost morale. This order.</p>
<h3>The Grave Situation of Military Preparedness in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Gradual Restoration of Order in the Chinese Territory and the Establishment of a Post-Disaster Committee</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: On the evening of the eighth of this month, Japanese individuals dispatched plainclothes squads to create disturbances in various parts of the Chinese territory. After their scheme failed, the Japanese Tianjin Garrison Commander Kashii sent a telegram inviting Chairman Wang Shuchang to discuss solutions at the Japanese military camp. In recent days, our side has removed the defensive fortifications located within 300 meters of the Japanese concession. However, the military preparedness of the Japanese concession remains unusually serious. Sandbags, barbed wire fences, etc., at the border with our side have not been removed. The southeast corner of the city is still guarded by Japanese soldiers, who have set up machine guns, directing them towards our side as a show of force. Only one gate at the southern end of Asahi Street, where the Japanese and French concessions meet, is open for people to pass through. Without a pass issued by the Japanese authorities, entry into the Japanese concession is not permitted. Even with a pass, rigorous checks by Japanese soldiers are required. Therefore, the situation in the Japanese concession is bleak and dismal. Major businesses are planning to move their goods out and prepare to open businesses in the British, French, or Chinese territories. From now on, business in the Japanese concession will inevitably decline, and the relationship between China and Japan will certainly worsen. Currently, eight or nine out of every ten residents of the Japanese concession have already moved. Even if things return to their original state in the future, it is expected that few will move back. In the Chinese territory, all order has gradually been restored in recent days. Various government agencies are also operating as usual. However, because the curfew time is still early, traffic is cut off starting at 4:00 PM, so all government agencies dismiss their employees early. Furthermore, because residents were alarmed by the recent plainclothes squad incident, middle- and upper-class families have all moved to the concessions, and shops have also moved their valuables to the concessions for safekeeping. During the daytime when the curfew is lifted, residents of the South City and the city proper are still taking their families and belongings via East Ma Road, bypassing the Special District Two of the Italian concession and the Special District Three, to the British and French concessions. Pedestrians on the roads are as numerous as ants. Streetcars have been running for three days, but because the Japanese concession is still under military preparedness, they all detour through the river to reach the British and French concessions. The city government is located in Hebei. During the recent disturbances, important official business was conducted in the private residence of Mayor Zhang Xueming in Special District One. Today, operations have resumed at the city government, and a post-disaster committee has been established, divided into military, diplomatic, and local affairs sections for research. The candidates for the committee members have also been determined as follows: (1) Tianjin Incident Foreign Affairs Research Committee: Chairman Zhang Xueming, Acting Chairman Zhang Guochen, Members Zou Shangyou, Zhou Longguang, Huang Zongfa, Quan Shaoqing, Li Qingquan, Ning Xiangnan, Shen Dijia, He Yufang, Wang Wenshan, Han Linsheng, Wu Ou; (2) Local Affairs Research Committee: Chairman Zhang Xueming, Acting Chairman Yan Zhiyi, Members Chen Xiaozhuang, Zhang Pint, Bian Baimei, Wang Xiaoyan, Deng Qinglan, Tao Jing, Liu Huanwen; (3) Military Affairs Research Committee: Chairman Zhang Xueming, Acting Chairman Liu Jialuan, Members Dong Zhifang, Wang Yimin, Lu Lu, Liu Mengtan, Li Runxuan, Yan Jinglu.

<h3>Hubei Province's Finances on the Brink of Collapse</h3>
<p>Wu Guogang to Go to Beijing to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Hubei's finances are now riddled with holes and on the verge of collapse. According to official sources, the crux of the problem lies in two things: first, the overly rapid abolition of likin (internal transit taxes), with business taxes failing to compensate for the loss; and second, the devastating floods, making it impossible to collect land taxes. At the same time, Red bandits and local bandits are rising up in mutual support, and the expenses for suppressing bandits are adding a significant burden. With daily losses accumulating, the situation has become unmanageable. When the order to abolish likin was issued, the former Finance Commissioner Guan Shi had neither a meticulous plan for implementing business taxes nor employed the right people. As a result, since the collection of the tax began, monthly revenue has been no more than 100,000 yuan. After deducting the expenses for establishing the bureau and paying salaries, little was left. In order to maintain government and education expenses, it was necessary to divert funds from various sources. As a result, debt piled up, and finances fell into disarray. The current Finance Commissioner Wu Guozhen, after taking office, is still relying on borrowing to maintain operations. Moreover, after the floods, all counties have become disaster areas, with no land tax revenue at all. In total, from Zhang's tenure to Wu's, the Finance Office owes more than 6 million yuan in government, education, and police expenses. Wu has personally borrowed 2 million yuan, diverting funds from dyke construction and accumulating debts for construction and bandit suppression expenses. Employees of various government agencies are on the verge of starvation, and teachers and faculty in various schools are in danger of striking. When likin was abolished, Finance Minister Song Ziwen promised to provide 300,000 yuan per month in central assistance, which was later increased to 500,000 yuan. However, there is still a monthly deficit of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, and even at the bare minimum, the deficit is still more than 600,000 yuan. Now that the Central Finance Committee has been established, the Ministry of Finance has indicated that the central assistance funds are subject to the unified allocation by the Central Finance Committee. Therefore, the assistance funds for October have not yet been remitted, and the Finance Office's treasury is empty, making the situation even more difficult. It is reported that Song Ziwen telegraphed Hubei yesterday, summoning Wu to Beijing to discuss relief measures in person. Wu plans to travel to Beijing by plane in the next few days, and the outcome will depend on this trip. As for the Finance Committee established a few days ago, responsible personnel have been designated and will formulate a plan for government adoption. At the same time, the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce is also extremely concerned about this matter. Today, they sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Finance Committee, requesting that the assistance funds be remitted quickly to stabilize Wuhan. The text of the telegram is as follows: (To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance and the Central Finance Committee: We respectfully believe that since Hubei province abolished likin, local finances have been extremely difficult. Although the central government has provided 500,000 yuan in monthly assistance, the local authorities have reduced bandit suppression, education, security, and industrial expenses to the bare minimum. There is still a budget shortfall of 600,000 yuan, which cannot be diverted and has become a debt. The treasury is empty and has been exhausted. Moreover, this year's floods have been exceptionally severe, with devastation everywhere. Relying on the business community is out of the question, as commerce is in decline and finance is exhausted. Recovery to the original state will have to wait until next year. This is the case in Hankou, and other counties and cities can be imagined. Relying on supplementing the deficit with land tax is also out of the question, as production is virtually nonexistent and there is no harvest. The survivors of the disaster are suffering from hunger and cold. At a time when the brutal Japanese are invading and the situation is serious, the military, police, and education sectors are already facing a lack of food. Even the central assistance funds that were previously relied upon for support have been delayed. The situation is urgent and fraught with danger. If the central government does not find a way to maintain the situation, the Yangtze and Han rivers will be turbulent, and officials and people will be helpless, which is a real concern. We earnestly request that you take into account the previous situation and quickly allocate funds according to the original plan to provide emergency relief, maintain the status quo, and safeguard the locality. Moreover, Hubei province remits several million yuan in central taxes every month. The original plan for assistance funds was only 500,000 yuan. It would be easy to transfer the surplus to cover the deficit. Stabilizing Wuhan is essential for safeguarding the central region, and the overall situation depends on it. We dare not make reckless statements to cause alarm. In urgent need, we remain expectant. (November 19))</p>
<h3>Bombing Incident on a Ferry in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Explode a Ferry in Shiqiao After Extortion Fails</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The pirate winds in Guangdong have not yet subsided. Recently, the defense forces have stepped up their defenses. Unable to succeed along the coast, the bandits have changed their tactics to engage in acts of demonstration, specifically targeting ferries before they set sail, detonating bombs as a means of intimidation. Most rural ferries dock along the Bund before setting sail. The fact that bandits dare to detonate bombs amidst the numerous military and police is indeed rampant. The Zhaoyin Street entrance of the Bund and the Shengdu Wharf are where the Fook Kee ferry, which travels between Guangzhou and Shiqiao in Panyu, docks. As usual, the ferry departs from the province at 8:30 every morning to return to Shiqiao. On the morning of the 16th of this month, as the ferry was untying its mooring lines, a loud explosion suddenly erupted in the cabin, shaking the entire ship and splashing water everywhere. The passengers on board were shocked and terrified. The crew, realizing something was amiss, immediately joined forces with the water police to search the ship. After a long search, no suspects were found. However, in the restaurant's "Yi" cabin, fragments of a bomb were discovered. The ship's planks and windows had been pierced by shrapnel. In the neighboring "Fu" cabin, a female passenger and a ship crew member suffered minor injuries. The injured female passenger, surnamed Li, was 28 years old and from Shawan Township in Panyu. She suffered shrapnel wounds to her neck and feet. The injured crew member, named Zhang Fa, was the ship's cook and was working near the cabin when he was hit by the bomb on his left hand. According to the ship owner, the ship had received a letter from a bandit leader named He Yao several days ago, demanding a large sum of money with threatening language. At the time, it was dismissed as a common tactic of bandit extortion. On the evening of the 15th, a young man came to the accounting office to pre-purchase a ticket for the "Yi" cabin, preparing for his female relatives to return to their hometown the next morning. He paid a deposit of one yuan. On the morning of the 16th, the young man was seen in the "Yi" cabin, carrying a wicker suitcase but nothing else. At 8:20 AM, the young man was seen taking the wicker suitcase back ashore. Ten minutes later, the explosion occurred in the "Yi" cabin. It is suspected that the bomb was detonated with a fuse. The young man lit the fuse and then fled. At this time, the Public Security Bureau also dispatched detectives to the scene to investigate. A few bomb fragments were found in the "Yi" cabin, along with a business card with the words "Guangdong Zhongzheng Hall" written on it. On the back were the words "Guan Xiu," and three seals were stamped on it, one with the inscription "Shunyi Xihai Zhong Chao," one with "Nanyi Changdi Dong You," and one with "Nanyi He Yao." The detectives, considering the rampant nature of the bandits, quickly presented the recovered business card and bomb fragments to the Haizhu Police Branch for reporting. The injured were sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. (Evening of the 16th)</p>
<h3>National Government Flood Relief Committee to Allocate American Wheat to Dredge the Shandong Canal</h3>
<p>Kong Lingrong, Director of the Shandong Canal Engineering Bureau, and Cao Ruizhi, Technical Expert of the Construction Department, previously went to Beijing on assignment to negotiate canal works. They have now returned to Ji'nan after completing their mission. According to them, the issue of water storage in Weishan Lake has been agreed upon by the Guide River Commission and the Jiangsu Construction Department, and Shandong Province is allowed to proceed with its plans. As for the American wheat that arrived in Shanghai, totaling 450,000 tons, worth approximately 30 million yuan, the National Government Flood Relief Committee has allocated 150,000 tons for emergency relief, 150,000 tons for building the Yangtze River dyke, 60,000 tons for repairing the Huai River dyke, and 50,000 tons for repairing the Subei Canal dyke. Although the disaster situation in Shandong Province is also very serious, no American wheat was allocated to them. After repeated explanations to the members of the Flood Relief Committee, they finally understood and agreed to submit Shandong's proposal to the general assembly for discussion. They also asked Committee Members Shen Baixian, Song Xishang, and Shi Ying to review the disaster situation in the Lu Canal area and the work-for-relief plan first. As a result of the review, it was proposed to allocate 6,000 tons of wheat to the Lu Canal. Later, at the general assembly on the 15th, the committee had only 40,000 tons of wheat left, but there were too many requests for allocation from various places. It seemed inappropriate to only allocate it to the Lu Canal and the pond projects in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It was decided that an overall calculation should be made by the chief engineer. In terms of the situation, Shandong Province could receive at least five or six thousand tons. The proposal of the representative is attached below: (Regarding the proposal, this year's floods in Shandong Province have accumulated, totaling more than 32 counties. The area along the canal accounts for more than ten counties. There are more than 20 breaches in the Si River, more than 40 breaches in the canal, and 2 breaches in the Xiaoqing River. Between August and September, 4.73 million mu of farmland were flooded, and the total number of affected people is about 880,000, with property losses estimated at about 30 million yuan. According to the latest survey, there are currently about 200,000 mu still submerged in the waters of Ziyang and Jinning counties, about 1.7 million mu in Wenshang, Jiaxiang, and Yutai counties, and about 100,000 mu in Dongping County, totaling about 2 million mu. The Canal Engineering Bureau of the Shandong Construction Department has prepared a work-for-relief plan for the disaster area along the canal and submitted it to the National Government Relief Committee for approval, requesting the allocation of American wheat. However, the project requires approximately 4.86 million yuan, and if American wheat is used, it will require 60,000 tons. Based on the current situation, the amount is too large, and it is feared that it will be difficult to allocate, which will hinder the progress of the project. The scope of the project is reduced based on the current situation in the disaster area as follows: (1) Dredging the Niutou River, from Mangsheng Gate in Wenshang County to Nanyang Town, 95 li long, with an estimated earthwork volume of 4,150,000 cubic meters, costing 0.2 yuan per cubic meter, requiring 830,000 yuan; (2) Dredging the Dongsi River, from Zhangjia Bridge to Shengjiawu, about 38 li long, with an estimated earthwork volume of 2,150,000 cubic meters, requiring 430,000 yuan; (3) Dredging the canal, from Hanzhuang to Taierzhuang, about 65 li long, with an estimated earthwork volume of 3,700,000 cubic meters, requiring 740,000 yuan. In total, the earthwork volume is 10 million cubic meters, requiring approximately 2 million yuan. It is proposed to allocate 25,000 tons of American wheat to provide relief. Is this appropriate? Please decide.)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Conflict Between Soldiers and Civilians in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Farmers from Hujing and Houtang townships in Changle County clashed with the Marine Corps over refusing to pay water fees to the Lianbinggang Irrigation Bureau. In order to handle the case, the provincial government held a temporary meeting on the 9th and decided to send Civil Affairs Commissioner Zheng Baojing, along with Provincial Defense Army Brigade Commander Zhou Xiaopei and Marine Corps Brigade Commander Jin Zhenzhong, to investigate. It also ordered one battalion each from the Provincial Defense Army First Brigade (i.e., Zhou's brigade) stationed in Fuzhou, the Marine Corps First Brigade (i.e., Jin's brigade) stationed in Lianjiang, and the Provincial Defense Army First Detachment (Lin Jing's unit) stationed in Fuqing to proceed to the border of Changle and be dispatched by Zheng, along with the Hai'ou gunboat stationed in Zhanggang (i.e., the estuary of Hujing). If a resolution could not be reached, a large-scale suppression would be launched. On the 10th, Zheng led the two brigade commanders Zhou and Jin, as well as Civil Affairs Department Secretary Lin Pengnan, Section Chief Chen Tankong, and Director Chen Guoyu, to Changle by boat. On the 11th, they arrived in Changle and stayed at the county government. In the capacity of a villager (Zheng is also from Changle), he convened a meeting with the village elders, explaining the advantages and disadvantages. The villagers, realizing that they were surrounded by the provincial army on all sides, immediately accepted the conditions proposed by Zheng: (1) Pay half of the upper season water fees, and the standard for the lower season water fees will be determined after a survey; (2) Reorganize the Self-Defense Corps and turn in the remaining firearms; (3) Punish the ringleaders; (4) Compensate the families of the deceased soldiers with bereavement expenses. Zheng then left Chen Tankong and Chen Guoyu in the county to handle the aftermath, while he, along with the two brigade commanders Zhou and Jin, returned to the province on the 12th to report. The provincial government also recognized that the Lianbinggang Irrigation Bureau had mishandled the matter and decided to take back government control and hand it over to the Construction Department for reorganization. Yesterday, the Construction Department appointed Chen Zugang, a native of Changle, as the director. The turmoil is expected to come to an end. (November 13)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>First District Wins Lawsuit Over Tidal Fields: The First District Office of this county and the residents Lu Qing'an and others were involved in a lawsuit over tidal field property. In May of this year, the county court ruled that the ownership of the disputed land belonged to the District Office. After Lu Qing'an lost the case, he declared that he was not satisfied and appealed to the High Court. The appellants Lu Qing'an and others retained lawyers Wang Tinggan and others as agents, and the appellee Zhong Taishi (legal representative of the District Office) retained lawyers Wu Chengzi and others as agents. The subject matter of the dispute was more than 94 mu of tidal fields and more than 32 mu of tidal flats. The property originally belonged to the Tongshan Hall and was later transferred to the local self-government organization, which eventually became the current District Office. Lu Qing'an and others leased it from the Songjinqing Official Property Bureau in 1915 and obtained a license from the Ministry of Finance. Because the rent was still collected by the District Office, they filed a lawsuit to confirm ownership. Now, after repeated investigations in the second instance, the appeal was rejected, and the ownership still belongs to the First District Office.</p>
<p>New Judge Arrives in Songjiang: Li Wenwei, a candidate judge of the County Court, was ordered to be transferred to the Yangzhou Branch Court as a judge. Zhang Yihuang, a judge of the Shanghai District Court, was appointed to fill the vacancy. Li left for Yangzhou on the 19th to take up his new post. The newly appointed judge Zhang arrived in Songjiang on the 22nd to take up his duties.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Ni Laoda Beats His Wife to Death: Ni Laoda, a visitor from outside the city, runs a sesame cake shop near the Suspension Bridge outside the West Gate. His wife, Zhang, helped her husband manage the shop and was quite diligent and thrifty. In July of last year, Ni Laoda suddenly became acquainted with Cai Mai, a female worker in the raw silk department of the nearby Jinji Silk Factory. They lived together, acting like husband and wife. Recently, he wanted to take her as a concubine. His wife, Zhang, found out about it and strongly opposed it. As a result, disputes and quarrels arose frequently in the family. The day before yesterday, Ni Laoda beat Zhang severely with an iron rod, causing injuries all over her body and severe internal injuries. She died from her injuries yesterday. After hearing the news, the deceased's younger brother, Zhang Niangen, had a serious discussion with Ni Laoda and planned to report it to the court for an autopsy to determine the truth. Ni, knowing that he was in the wrong, asked someone to mediate and offered 130 yuan to cover the cost of the coffin and funeral. However, Niangen refused and decided to resolve the matter through legal means.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Send Letter Requesting Reduction of Stamp Duty: The Silk Factory Association of this county, in view of the drastic drop in silk prices this year and the sluggish silk trade, with many silk factories successively declaring closure, has been paying 260 yuan per month to the Stamp Tax Bureau for stamp duty. Over the past few months, a large amount has accumulated and cannot be sold. Now, after a meeting of the committee, it has been decided to reduce the amount by half starting next month. Once business recovers and all factories are operating, they will increase the amount again. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it forward a letter to the Stamp Tax Bureau, requesting permission to reduce the amount by half to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Captured Kidnappers and Requested Punishment: The 280th Regiment stationed in Tongzhou, while suppressing bandits in the newly opened port along the Yangtze River, captured eleven kidnappers, including Qin Mingfu, and rescued eight male and female hostages from Taicang and Qidong counties, including Shi Chang. They also seized many box cannons and rifles. After the captured bandits were interrogated by the regimental headquarters, Regiment Commander Pan presented them to Commander Liang for instructions on punishment.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Liton Ferry Robbed: The Qingzhen Long-Distance Ferry of Liton Company, which departed from Zhenjiang on the 17th, encountered robbers while sailing to Gaoyou Lake. When collecting tickets, a dispute arose with the robbers on board, forcing the boat to stop. Many robber boats approached and took away a passenger surnamed Yin and injured a passenger surnamed Chen. The injured passenger was transported to Zhenjiang for treatment yesterday. The extent of the losses to the entire boat is still under investigation. The Zhenqing long-distance ferries have not departed for the past two days due to a lack of tugboats. Today, they have resumed normal operations.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Implements Confiscation of Japanese Goods: Anti-Japanese sentiment in this county is becoming increasingly tense. Yesterday afternoon, the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association implemented the confiscation of Japanese goods in various stores. The owners of Kaitai Jinghuo Store, Zeng Yizhai, and the responsible persons of Yu Cao Clothes Store, Gao Baolin, and Hengxingxiang Baihuo Store, Gao Yuzhai, who had been proven to be selling Japanese goods, were to be punished by being placed in wooden cages and paraded through the streets. Upon hearing this, the merchants were extremely alarmed. As a result, hundreds of merchants gathered last night to petition the Chamber of Commerce. The stores involved remained closed today. The military and political authorities, fearing that it would disrupt public order, convened a meeting at the Supervisory Office with the Chamber of Commerce, the Anti-Japanese Association, and students from various schools to discuss the matter. Wang Jingting, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, advocated for a re-identification. County Magistrate Chen Zhaorong proposed a compromise, suggesting that the Anti-Japanese Association report the handling of the traitorous merchants to the County Party Department and forward it to the Chamber of Commerce for review to avoid resentment among the merchants. Subsequently, Gu Tian, a standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese Association, convened a meeting of all committee members at the Supervisory Office and decided that the original plan must be maintained. After the meeting, the Anti-Japanese Association telegraphed the Public Security Bureau, asking it to hand over the three traitorous merchants detained yesterday to the association for execution by placing them in wooden cages and parading them through the streets. The merchants, upon hearing the news, still wanted to find a way to avoid it, but the popular sentiment was so strong that it was impossible to reverse. Around 4:00 PM, the Supervisory Office ordered the 94th Brigade to send a battalion of soldiers to maintain order throughout the city. Zhu Zhusun, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, and Chang Shizhi, the general manager, went to the province this morning to petition the party and government agencies, but the outcome is unknown. In the evening, Mr. Liu, a representative of the Shanghai Student National Salvation Association, came to Yangzhou to discuss publicity matters with various schools here. It is also reported that a large number of students from Shanghai will come to Yangzhou to publicize in the next day or two, in order to awaken the masses.</p>
<h3>Yangzhong</h3>
<p>The Humorous Proclamation Amidst a False Alarm: Since the execution of two kidnappers in Yangzhong on the 16th, and the capture of several old robbery suspects, the security has been extremely tight. The county government had issued a notice in advance prohibiting the setting off of firecrackers at night. Unexpectedly, at about 3:00 AM on the 17th, five or six shots of a box cannon were suddenly heard near the county government, causing panic among the residents. County Magistrate Bi, hearing the alarm, got out of bed and ordered the entire police force to search in all directions. However, after traveling about three miles, it was found that the family of a villager named Ding Kailong was setting off side cannons to celebrate the raising of the roof of their house. However, the high-flying cannons they were setting off were all single-shot, which led to the misunderstanding of the sound of a box cannon. Police Captain Ma Zishu, believing that they should not have violated the prohibition, brought the house owner to the county. At that time, it was not yet dawn. County Magistrate Bi immediately opened court and questioned him. Considering his ignorance, he fined him ten yuan to be used as a reward for the policemen, and then issued the following proclamation, which is copied below: (At this time of urgent winter defense, it has been clearly ordered that setting off firecrackers at night is prohibited. How could you not have heard of it? Yet this morning at 3:00, a sudden cannon sound was heard, and the County Magistrate was awakened in his sleep. The entire police force went out to defend and searched in all directions. Who knew that it was not caused by bandits, but by a villager setting off high-flying cannons while building a house? This is a clear violation of the prohibition, which disrupted public order. The law is strict and should be punished. However, considering that the defendant is an ignorant villager, the circumstances are forgivable, and the police force's loyalty to their duties is commendable. It is ordered that the fine be reduced to ten yuan for use as a reward for the policemen. However, the villager is building a new house, and arresting and bringing him to court will inevitably bring some bad luck. The magistrate deeply understands the people's feelings and presents you with auspicious words, wishing you high advancement for generations to come.) In the midst of fear, Mr. Ding heard this court proclamation and left happily.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Rather Burn Japanese Goods Than Seal Them: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county, after the sixth executive committee meeting, decided that all Japanese goods that had been registered in the stores would be sealed. An inspection team was organized to conduct inspections and sealed up Japanese goods in more than 50 stores. However, the Hengdali Clock Store in Shuangjing Lane opposed the sealing and said that rather than being sealed, it would rather send the goods to the park to be burned in public. The team members agreed to the request and brought a total of 28 large and small wall clocks from the store to the association. After the seventh meeting, it was decided to pile up the inferior goods in the park's gymnasium and burn them in public.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Unclear Handover by County Magistrate, Properties Confiscated: The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance has found that there are more than 120 former county magistrates in the province who have not made clear handover reports when they were replaced over the years, totaling a loss of 1,364,775 yuan in public funds. At a time when the provincial treasury is in dire straits, all undertakings are affected due to financial constraints. Although the former county magistrates who lost such a large sum have been repeatedly and strictly ordered to pay up within a time limit, it is still difficult to achieve the desired results. The Department of Finance has now formulated a plan to order the current county magistrates to confiscate all the properties of the county magistrates who lost the funds in their original places of origin, and it has been submitted to the provincial government for approval before implementation.</p>
<p>The Waterworks Association Has Ended Completely: The Hangzhou City Waterworks Preparatory Committee began to wind down and hand over to the waterworks after implementing the water supply. Yesterday, all matters were completed. The budgeted amount of the project was 1.25 million yuan, and the actual expenditure was 1,112,134 yuan. Waterworks bonds were raised for 700,400 yuan, offsetting 467,000 yuan. The total was 1,171,902.99 yuan. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the city government for closure.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Recovered Stolen Cargo Ship: A staff member of the ship station in Pinghu discovered a cargo ship yesterday at Lugong Bridge in Dongmen. Upon boarding and inspection, they found three individuals in the rear cabin. Their hands, feet, and eyes were all bound. After untying them and inquiring about the situation, it was learned that they were from Ma Yong'an Flower Shop in the old Xu Shi town of Dadongmen, Changshu. They were transporting 300 bales of cotton to Zhang Yitai Flower Shop in Minhang. While en route, about two miles from Songjiang, they encountered a pirate ship that ordered them to stop. The pirates boarded the cargo ship, tied them up, and robbed them. They were unable to provide details about how they were robbed and how they ended up in Pinghu, as their eyes were covered. The staff member took them to the Second Public Security Bureau to report to Director Huang for handling.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Director's Resignation Approved: Mao Bingli, Director of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, has served for nearly three years. Recently, due to financial difficulties, he resigned to the provincial government. It is now known that the provincial government has approved his resignation and appointed Yu Jimin as acting director. He is expected to arrive from Beijing soon to take office.</p>
<p>Chen Chunxiu Kidnapped by Bandits: Chen Chunxiu, a resident of Ertangtou Village, Jingzhong Township, Yisi Village, Yuyao, is over forty years old and a farmer by trade. His family is relatively well-off. Twenty or more bandits, all armed with pistols, suddenly broke into his house in the middle of the night the day before yesterday, looting wantonly. They then kidnapped the head of the household, Chen Chunxiu, and left a note demanding a ransom of 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Cui Erdang's Gang Defeated on the Anhui Border: Cui Erdang, a major bandit from Henan, recently led 2,000 fierce bandits from the areas of Xincai, Runan, and Xiangcheng, and infiltrated the border of Taihe County in northern Anhui. Liu Zhi, Chairman of Henan, has dispatched the entire Second Brigade of Hu Zongnan's First Army to pursue them from Henan into Anhui. The troops killed many bandits entrenched at Zhao Deying. Cui Erdang led several hundred remaining bandits to flee southwest towards Tu Bei Ji in Fuyang County. Liu, the magistrate of Fuyang, dispatched the security regiment to intercept them. Cui's gang could not gain a foothold in Fuyang and fled southwest, now retreating back to the Henan border.</p>

<h3>The Third Guangdong Provincial Education Representative Conference Opens</h3>
<p>More than fifty representatives from various counties and cities report</p>
<p>Second Day: Discussion of Proposals Third Day: Elections</p>
<p>The Third Guangdong Provincial Education Representative Conference opened at 9:00 AM on the 17th of this month. More than fifty representatives from various counties reported. On that day, in front of the Education Association on Jiuyao Fang, a high and earnest national flag banner was erected, adorned with fresh flowers, bearing the words "(The Third Guangdong Provincial Education Representative Conference)". The venue was decorated with flags of all nations and provincial flags. In the center of the hall hung a portrait of Sun Yat-sen. The arrangement was extremely solemn. Before 8:00 AM, representatives from various organizations arrived to observe the ceremony in a steady stream, including Xu Chongqing, President of Zhongshan University, Zhong Rongguang, President of Lingnan University, Jiao Yitang, representative of the National Government, and many representatives from the provincial and municipal party headquarters and governments. The opening ceremony began at 9:00 AM. Chairman Zeng Shicheng performed the rituals, followed by Chairman Jin giving an opening address and reporting on the preparations for the conference. He stated that the Third Guangdong Provincial Education Representative Conference was convened by the Guangzhou Municipal Education Association based on the Education Association Law promulgated by the Legislative Yuan and the Organizational Plan for People's Organizations. More than fifty representatives from various counties have now reported, sufficient for the required legal number. Therefore, today's opening ceremony is being held. The second day will be for discussing proposals, and the third day will be for re-electing the provincial education association. The matters to be handled by this conference include electing directors and supervisors for the Third Provincial Education Association, gathering education representatives from various counties to report on the status of education in their respective counties and cities, and discussing plans to improve local education. Currently, most counties and cities are plagued by a shortage of education funds, hindering the long-term development of education. Efforts should be made in the future to resolve this difficulty to promote the development of local education. Recently, our eastern neighbor invaded the Northeast, tearing our territory and violating our sovereignty. How should we in the education sector lead young people to fulfill their duty to save the country? All these aspects require our collective thinking and research to formulate effective plans to enhance the benefits of education and seek the survival of our nation, and so on. Next came speeches by guests, including Jiao Yitang and Xu Chongqing. Finally, the education representative from Huaxian delivered a response. After the speech, the chairman proposed the public election of five members to the proposal review committee. The meeting adjourned with a photo session at 11:00 AM. In the afternoon, the representatives paid their respects to the seventy-one martyrs at Huanghuagang. At 5:00 PM, the Education Association hosted a banquet for the representatives from various counties at the Yuexiu Restaurant. (November 17th evening)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Issues 10,000 Yuan in Overseas Study Funds</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province is facing extreme financial difficulties, and the funds for Zhejiang students studying abroad have not been issued for many months. The students at the overseas study office repeatedly urged and presented their plight, but the provincial treasury was empty and unable to cope. Even the regular education expenses for the whole province have only been issued up to September. Recently, efforts were made to scrape together a total of 10,000 yuan, which was allocated to overseas study funds. The Finance Department yesterday ordered the Provincial Treasury to allocate the funds, which will be remitted by the Education Department to various countries for use.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of the Great Inventor Edison</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 21st of this month, six institutions, including the National Central Research Institute, Central University, Private Jinling University, Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, the Science Society of China, and the Chinese Institute of Engineers, held a meeting in the Jinling University Auditorium to commemorate Edison. A portrait of Edison was hung in the hall. Representatives from all walks of life gathered, and a moment of silence was observed to express condolences. Cai Yuanpei, the chairman, delivered an opening address, followed by speeches by Wu Jingheng, Zhu Jiahua, Wei Yi, and Yang Xingfo, all of whom included encouragement to the Chinese people in their commemoration of the great man. The gist of Cai's speech was that Edison was a good friend to humanity, able to help us solve material and spiritual difficulties. Wu's speech stated that we often say "(His achievements are no less than those of Yu)", because Yu was a master of engineering, able to control floods. Edison's contribution extends to all of humanity, able to pierce through the mysteries of the universe. Yang's speech stated that memorial services can be divided into two types: (1) those belonging to emotion, which are ordinary memorial services; (2) those belonging to reason, which is today's meeting. Most of the participants have no personal connection with Edison, but came to the meeting to commemorate him in order to recognize his value. Edison obtained more than 2,000 patent rights for his work in the United States and more than 1,000 in foreign countries. Currently, the investment in Edison's inventions in the United States is 215 billion US dollars. The reason why he was able to achieve such success, and the reason why the Chinese people have not produced such a figure, is entirely due to the different views on life. He was indifferent to wealth and fame, and only took hard work and creation as his own duty. A commemorative booklet about Edison was printed and given to each attendee.</p>

<p>Telegram to the Government: Urgent. To the Nationalist Government in Nanjing. The government's responsibility is to protect the country and its people. The soldier's duty is to defend the territory. Since September 18th, the violent Japanese have invaded Fengji without warning. The government has deceived the people with calmness, and the soldiers have lingered and gasped for breath. In the two months, the territory outside the pass has become a foreign land, and the people of the Northeast have become barbarians. But the party in power still adheres to twisted arguments, and the generals holding military power still enjoy themselves leisurely. We have repeatedly thought that if we sit back and watch for a long time, we will regret it too late. Instead of perishing as slaves, it is better to maintain integrity in time. The meat-eaters are base, so they should plan for themselves early. We respectfully submit this telegram in advance, requesting the government to be responsible and clearly reply to the following points: (1) Does the government have the determination to send troops to fight against Japan? (2) Does the government have any punishment for the derelict officials in the Northeast, such as Zhang Xueliang? If there are concrete measures for the above two points, please reply immediately. In addition, there are several matters that need to be explained: (1) General Ma Zhanshan is fighting alone in Jiang Province. The people of the whole country are either donating funds or enlisting in the army, but why does the government absolutely not provide practical assistance, resulting in the loss of the opportunity? (2) The people are the main body of the country, and the government is the agency entrusted by the people to govern. The people have the right to petition on national affairs and the right to self-defense in times of national crisis. But why does the government have a clear order prohibiting the people from going to Beijing to petition? What is the reason for this unwarranted infringement of the rights that the people should enjoy under the law? In short, the survival of the country and the lives of the people are closely related. On the day the country survives, the rights of the country can be monopolized by a few officials. After the country perishes, the pain of national subjugation cannot be borne by a few officials. National affairs are the affairs of the whole nation. All sins are forgiven, but patriotism is not a crime. All rights can be deprived by the government, but the people's right to life and self-defense cannot be deprived by the government. The country is in such a state of danger that we are guided by our conscience and have long put our lives out of consideration. If the government's reply and explanation to the above items are not satisfactory, it is the government that cuts itself off from the people, not the people who cut themselves off from the government first.

<h3>Hangzhou Students Go to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Yesterday, Heading to Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>More than 1,600 male and female students from middle schools and universities in Hangzhou went to Beijing to petition. Yesterday, they departed from three locations in Hangzhou: Nanxing Bridge and Qiaonan, taking two passenger trains on the Qianhang Road. The first statistics show that more than 800 people left Hangzhou Station at about 9:00 AM, taking the express train from Zha Kai Jing to Beijing. The second batch of more than 700 people came to Shanghai by third and fourth class train at about 10:00 AM and arrived at the North Station at 7:30 PM to transfer to the Beijing-Shanghai Road night train to Beijing. The students prepared their own drinks and food and purchased tickets according to regulations. Along the way, the captains of each school were responsible for commanding. However, the road administration authorities had received an order from the National Government through the Ministry of Railways to find a way to stop the students from going to Beijing. Director Guo Chengen personally went to Hangzhou to persuade the students and planned to quickly dispatch the train. However, the representatives of each school insisted that it was a must and that they had purchased tickets according to the regulations. The Railway Bureau did not seem to have the power to stop them, so they still boarded the train one after another. However, in order to take into account the passengers along the way, they departed in two trains.</p>
<h3>National Salvation United Association of Shanghai Educational Circles Telegram to Request Dispatch of Troops</h3>
<p>Minutes of the Sixteenth Executive Committee of the National Salvation United Association of Shanghai Educational Circles, Date: November 21, 12:00 noon, Attendees: Zhao Luqing, Li Bojun, Ma Zongrong, Zheng Tonghe, Li Zhaobao, Chu Fucheng, Jia Foru, Yang Weiyu, Wang Xiaoying, Chen Gonglu, Ni Wenya, A. Report, B. Discussion, (1) Resolved to send a telegram to both Beijing and Guangdong requesting the dispatch of troops to fight and recover the lost territory, (2) Resolved, send a telegram to Shi Zhaoji, only discuss the issue of Japanese troop withdrawal at the League of Nations, refuse to discuss the treaty issue, (3) Resolved, send a telegram to the government to dismiss and punish Zhang Xueliang and Wan Fulin, (4) Resolved, send a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, opposing the sale of sealed Japanese goods by any means at this time, (5) Resolved, the next regular meeting will be changed to 6:30 PM next Tuesday,</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government (South): (1) To the National Government in Nanjing, Liao and Ji have fallen for two months. The Central Government once promised that if the enemy advanced again, we would send troops. The reason why the people have endured and remained calm is that they hoped for the government's final solution. But now Heilongjiang has fallen again. The decision between national subjugation and national salvation is at this time. The government has an unshirkable responsibility to defend the country and resist foreign aggression. Please send a large army to fight and recover the lost territory. Our people should assist the government with a determination to die to save this national crisis. The Shanghai National Salvation United Association of Shanghai Educational Circles kowtows, waiting for orders. (2) To the National Government in Nanjing, Zhang Xueliang was responsible for defending the territory and possessed an army of 300,000, but he allowed the beautiful rivers and mountains of the Northeast to fall overnight. The frontier officials are like this, and the Central Government cannot shirk the blame for losing people. Our people endure the pain and shed tears, still hoping that Zhang Xueliang can redeem himself with merit. But the violent Japanese launched a large-scale invasion of Heilongjiang, and General Ma Zhanshan fought alone for more than ten days. It was not heard that Zhang Xueliang sent a single soldier or arrow, allowing the Black Wall to fall again. The former Heilongjiang Chairman Wan Fulin's son embezzled funds and left his post without authorization, which is extremely insane. Where do the party's and the country's laws and disciplines exist today? We hope that the government will dismiss Zhang Xueliang immediately and punish him for losing territory and ruining the country. Wan Fulin should be escorted to Beijing immediately, ordered to recover the stolen money, and punished severely to demonstrate national law and appease public anger. Shanghai National Salvation United Association of Shanghai Educational Circles kowtows.</p>

<h3>Jinan's Aid to Ma Anti-Japanese Corps Departs for Battlefield Service</h3>
<p>Hope Fellow Countrymen Unite and Rise to Meet the National Crisis</p>
<p>Since receiving the news of the fall of Qi and Liu Har, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the National Jinan University has held meetings for days to discuss stepping up anti-Japanese work. Students Lin Jingxian, Xu Zanqi, Zhuang Xinli, Shi Xinhua, Chen Chunxiu, and Yu Kang, were indignant at the aggressive attacks of the violent Japanese on Heilongjiang Province and General Ma's lonely resistance. With the elite of one province, he is resisting the barbarians of one country, which is not a long-term solution. If we do not provide assistance at this time, when will we? They specially organized the Aid Ma Anti-Japanese Corps and departed this morning to go north to Heilongjiang to join General Ma's army and work earnestly. Mr. Qin Ziyi, an employee of the Hufeng Bank in this city, generously donated 60 yuan for travel expenses, and Mr. Huang Pi'an donated 5 yuan. It is hoped that fellow countrymen across the country will go to the national crisis together and save the country from danger, so as to follow in the footsteps of the six gentlemen.</p>

<h3>Cheers Shake the Wilderness Jinan Beats the Western Police</h3>
<p>Superior Spirit and Strength</p>
<p>The Prestigious Name of the Western Police Swept Away</p>
<p>Result: Three to Zero</p>
<p>The day after the defeat of Donghua, Jinan unexpectedly won against the Western Police by three to zero. It was truly a happy event for a heartbroken person. All fans have the same feeling. We will describe the victory of the Jinan War to those who did not go.</p>
<h3>Jinan Demonstrates Skills to Defeat the Enemy</h3>
<p>The True Colors of a Man</p>
<p>Six or seven thousand spectators in Yiyuan danced and cheered, congratulating Jinan's success in defeating the enemy and raising the prestige of our nation. The excellent center-back line and the solid inner guards of Jinan surpassed previous records. With no worries in the rear, the forwards were able to advance as much as possible. Chen Zhenhe was the bravest of the three armies and charged forward without hesitation. The success of the first goal was due to this. The second goal was due to the excellent cooperation of the five forwards, causing the enemy to lose sight of one thing and lose sight of the other. Qiu Dongyan arrived quickly and the enemy's defense was lost. The last goal was also created by Qiu, who shot out like an arrow and hit the silk, leaving the goalkeeper helpless.</p>

<h3>Western Police Force Bows to a Formidable Foe</h3>
<p>Where is the prestige?</p>
<p>The Western Police Force was truly a titan in the football world, but unexpectedly met a formidable opponent, Jinan University, yesterday, resulting in a complete defeat. Their forward, the only dangerous figure, Wei Gensheng, was closely guarded by Mr. Liang, leaving him no room for activity. 推納 (Tui Na) appeared subdued, and 傑克 (Jack) looked weak. 法蘭斯 (France) demonstrated both intelligence and courage, advancing whenever there was an opening. However, Zhuang Shihong used both gentle and forceful tactics, making it difficult for him to cross the line. Occasionally, he intruded into the defensive zone, but 左馮 (Zuo Feng) and 右江 (You Jiang) handled him with ease. In the first half, the Western Police Force's central defense line and the two inner guards supported each other, making it impenetrable. In the second half, the formation became scattered, leading to repeated losses. The renowned center-back 軋許 (Ga Xu), facing such a strong opponent, also felt helpless.</p>

<h3>Chen Zhenhe Bravely Breaks Through the Defense</h3>
<p>The enemy loses heart</p>
<p>As the battle commenced, both sides used their strongest generals and elite troops to resist each other. Their internal defenses were solid, preventing any arbitrary actions. They moved back and forth, with dazzling speed in the midfield. Fifteen minutes passed in the blink of an eye. Fu Hexuan passed the ball to Liang, who then passed it to center forward Chen Zhenhe. Mr. Chen bravely advanced alone, skillfully avoiding three opponents. Where sincerity is applied, metal and stone can be opened. Sure enough, he bravely broke through the defense, causing the enemy to lose heart. The Western Police Force counterattacked, and the goalkeeper was surrounded. Fortunately, the enemy committed a foul, allowing them to escape danger safely. Soon after, Fu Hexuan scored a goal, but it was ruled offside. 梅洪 (Mei Hong) passed the ball to the left, and Luo Haiguang dribbled it forward swiftly. The goalkeeper rushed forward to catch it, averting the danger. In the first half, Jinan University took the lead with a score of 1-0.</p>
<h3>The Linked Formation Succeeds Again</h3>
<p>Excellent cooperation</p>
<p>The second half seemed like a different era. Jinan University showed improvement, while the Western Police Force regressed. The ball mainly circulated around the feet of Jinan University's players. The reason was that the Western Police Force's central defense line lost its pivotal role, causing a breakdown in coordination between the front and back lines. At this time, Jinan University was full of vigor and launched a fierce attack. After eighteen minutes, the five forwards passed the ball to each other in a linked formation, from Mei to Luo to Chen to Fu, and finally, Qiu Dongyan dove and swept the ball into the net, making it 2-0.</p>
<h3>Qiu Dongyan Scores for the Second Time</h3>
<p>Thunderous cheers</p>
<p>After losing two goals, the Western Police Force was filled with rage and made several attempts to attack, but they could not get past Feng's defense. The goalkeeper's knee was injured, raising concerns about a potential loss of defense. Mei Hongbao and Fu Hexuan repeatedly attempted long shots, but none hit the target. Luo Haiguang continued to play despite a leg injury, unwilling to show weakness. Chen Fuzhong passed the ball forward, and Qiu Dongyan, from 30 yards away, took advantage of the goalkeeper's unpreparedness and unleashed a swift and unexpected shot, hitting the target directly. The spectators were overjoyed and cheered thunderously. Jinan University had victory in their grasp and firmly defended their position to prevent a counterattack by several opponents. However, the enemy was at the end of their strength and unable to do anything. As a result, Jinan University defeated the Western Police Force 3-0, marking a highlight in the Westerners' Group A League.</p>

<h3>Finance 　　　Last Week's Speculative Gold Rebounded</h3>
<p>Chaotic state trending upwards</p>
<p>Only four taels added to spot goods</p>
<p>A drastic increase of 57 taels and 7 qian. Last week's speculative gold experienced a significant shift, with turbulent waves that were truly alarming. Due to the rollover period, January's prices increased, but the daily fluctuation of more than 20 taels made it difficult to handle. The chaotic state trended towards lower prices. This was because overseas silver markets fell again, and Shanghai exchange rates were also tight. The English exchange rate even shrunk by seven levels. The internal market further propped up gold. The gold industry had to offset previous short positions, but the current market is still dominated by short positions, mostly for hedging purposes. Since the beginning of the week, prices initially rose, with the lowest reaching 590 taels and 5 qian. On Wednesday, prices suddenly surged to 670 taels, reaching a total of 72 taels. Later, the market fluctuated, with advances and retreats of 30 taels, breaking through 40 taels. This was due to the unstable situation, especially the Japanese invasion of Northeast China, which felt even more fierce. The Japanese forcibly occupied 黑省 (Heisheng), causing panic among the people. Subsequently, prices rose another 60 taels. This week, the total increase was 81 taels and 5 qian. Recalling the statistics, the increase of 57 taels and 7 qian can be considered huge. This was truly a rebound after three consecutive weeks of decline. As for the period from November-December to January, the initial premium offered by the bulls was within 3 taels. Later, due to the increasing amount of spot goods on the market, which were transported from other ports, and due to the constant and urgent shortage of silver, there was no ability to accept spot goods. The shorts wanted to offer a premium, which affected the speculative gold market. The premium for speculative gold increased, decreasing from outside 10 taels to about 4 taels. The lack of direction was due to the US dollar settlement price being capped at 60 taels to more than 100 taels, eventually settling at under 90 taels. Observing the future trend, violent waves are inevitable. Yesterday (the 22nd), the large bars slightly increased again. A record of the general conditions of the week is provided below.</p>
<p>Daily changes are quite alarming. Starting on Monday (the 16th), the large bar silver was 4375, the silver price was 125, the initial order was also half a penny higher, then changed to a decrease of 0.25, the internal market trended tighter. Fellow traders initially sold off and then scooped up. As for the speculative gold market, it coincided with the rollover period. There was no transaction in December. Transactions were mainly in January. The opening price was 594 taels and a half, a small decrease of 2 taels and 7 qian compared to December. It was determined to be 90 and a half. Afterwards, it advanced bravely, once reaching 614 taels. Major players bought aggressively. At noon, it fell back 7 or 8 taels. The closing price was 605 taels and 5 qian. The afternoon opening price was 07 taels, and the closing price rallied to 17 taels and 8 qian, an increase of approximately 17 taels compared to the previous Saturday (November-December). The total difference throughout the day was 27 taels and 3 qian. On Tuesday, the large bar violently decreased by 3.5625 pennies, the silver price decreased by 0.2875, the initial order initially decreased by 1.5 pennies, then changed to a decrease of 0.25, the internal market also rallied, fellow traders vigorously covered their short positions. At the initial opening of the gold market, prices surged by 23 taels and 2 qian, reaching 641 taels. The next price was 48 taels and 7 qian. Later, due to the sale by the Guangdong group, and because the exchange rate was tight and secretly flat, the price fell to 36 taels and a half. Major players such as Wu covered their short positions, suddenly breaking through 50 taels, reaching 55 taels and a half at noon. The closing price was 54 taels and 2 qian. The afternoon opening price was 51 taels, the next price was 57 taels and 8 qian. George also covered his short positions, then the price went downstream again, although the fluctuations were uncertain. However, sellers began to be active, and the closing price was only 43 taels and 7 qian, still an increase of 25 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous day. The daily difference was 21 taels and 3 qian, and the volatility increased. On Wednesday, the large bar silver increased by 0.875, the silver price decreased by 0.15, the initial order decreased by three levels, the internal market was also tight, with more scooping. Thus, the gold market initially opened with an increase of 18 taels and 8 qian, at 662 taels and a half. This was on solid ground. The United States was dumping gold, so people were quite optimistic. There were still many buyers, and the price even exceeded 70 taels, reaching 72 taels. Afterwards, because spot goods inventory increased and the term period was reversed by the bulls, people suddenly weakened, falling sharply. At noon, it was only 52 taels, then the closing price was 54 taels and 3 qian. The afternoon opening price was 52 taels and a half. Later, all parties advanced. Mumbai repeatedly decreased by 32 annas, causing the gold price to surge by more than 10 taels, eventually reaching 68 taels and a half. The closing price was 68 taels, an increase of 24 taels and 3 qian compared to the previous day. There was a daily swing of 20 taels. On Thursday, the large bar decreased by 0.8125, the silver price decreased by 0.1375, the English gold rate did not change, the internal market was loose in English terms and tight in American terms, and brokers also settled accounts. Fellow traders had different inflows and outflows. The speculative gold market initially opened with a small decrease of 4 taels and a half, at 663 taels and a half. Because the private telegram did not change, people were pessimistic. Later, due to more buying, it reached 66 taels. Suddenly, news came that the situation in 黑省 (Heisheng) was tight, dropping 13 taels to 53 taels. Rumor had it that the exchange rate tightened sharply, surging by 20 taels to 72 taels. Later, because the selling trend was fierce, it retreated to 58 taels. At noon, it closed at 64 taels and 2 qian. In the afternoon, it was 59 taels and 8 qian. Afterwards, news suddenly came that 黑省 (Heisheng) had fallen and that Russia and Japan were in contact, causing people to panic. It suddenly became 48 taels and 5. At times, it increased to 52 taels. The closing price was still 49 taels and 8 qian, a small decrease of 18 taels and 2 qian compared to the previous day. This was a reversal of the previous increase of 67 taels since the term rollover on the 17th. The price difference throughout the day was 23 taels and 5 qian. On Friday, the large bar did not change, the forward price increased by 0.125, the silver price increased by 0.625, the initial order also increased by half a penny, the internal market trended looser, and there was a marked difference between scooping and blocking. The gold market opened at 53 taels and a half, an increase of 3 taels and 7 qian. The next price was 58 taels. Later, due to a telegram increasing by 0.75, the ground was solid, so it immediately fell to 48 taels. Then, it rose again to 56 taels and 5. However, actual buyers became discouraged. At noon, it was 45 taels. The closing price was 47 taels. In the afternoon, it was 47 taels and a half, then it moved from 50 taels to 45 taels and 6 qian. Then, it rose again to 51 taels. The people were uncertain, and the buying and selling were in a state of flux. After 3 o'clock, news suddenly came that there was another riot in Tianjin, and it was said that the League of Nations was planning to handle the situation with Japan using Articles 15 and 16 of the charter. This caused widespread panic, and major players dumped their holdings, falling by more than 10 taels, breaking through 40 taels, suddenly reaching 36 taels. 恒興 (Heng Xing) came in with 40 taels and 5 qian. The closing price was 38 taels, a further decrease of 11 taels and 8 qian compared to the previous day. The daily fluctuation was 22 taels. On Saturday, the large bar increased by 0.25, the American silver increased by 0.375, the initial order did not change, the internal market trended higher, and there were still many buyers, and accounts were being settled. The speculative gold market initially opened with an increase of 9 taels, at 647 taels. Afterwards, it fluctuated around 50 taels, once decreasing to 43 taels and 3 qian, then reaching 61 taels. The volatility was not small, but buyers were bold. Jewish merchants such as 乔日夫 (Qiao Rifu) were scooping aggressively, so the market was attractive. The noon closing price was 58 taels and 5 qian, a rebound of 20 taels and a half. The closing price moved to 60 taels again. In half a day, there was a fluctuation of 17 taels and 7 qian.

<p>Opening at 5 qian 5 fen</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the tightness of silver was unseen in any other period. The overnight interest rates in the morning and afternoon markets were both 5 qian 5 fen, an unprecedented high this year. It was rumored that the overnight silver interest rate in the 小總會 (Small General Association) the night before had reached a top price of 7 qian, and yet no one responded, showing how tense the market atmosphere was. But realistically, the current period of closure is not comparable to the development period in the first half of the year, so it is predicted that there is no major danger.

<h3>Securities 　Last Week's Bond Prices Fell Sharply Again</h3>
<p>Decreases of 2-3 yuan to 6-7 yuan</p>
<p>Transactions of 55 million yuan</p>
<p>Last week (from November 16 to November 21), the bond market situation at the local securities exchange showed extremely few spot transactions. The entire week only saw 33,000 yuan in transactions, including 9,000 yuan in unified tax bonds, 5,600 yuan each in demobilization bonds and 19 bonds, and only several thousand yuan in other bonds. The forward market saw mostly sporadic transactions, and the market situation was generally quiet. Daily transaction activity for the week showed high fluctuations on weekend days and relatively active transactions. Each had 12-13 million of transactions. Wednesday also had 9.35 million in transactions. The market was always quiet at the beginning of the week. Only a little more than 6 million yuan were traded each day. Statistics for the total transactions over the whole week were 55,170,000 yuan, a little more than the 5 million yuan from the previous week. The numbers of unified tax bonds and salt tax bonds were higher. Unified tax bonds were 5,880,000 yuan for the November term and 5,065,000 yuan for the December term. Salt tax bonds were 5.1 million yuan for the November term and 5,055,000 yuan for the December term. 20 bonds were 5,250,000 yuan for the November term and 3,770,000 yuan for the December term. Disarmament bonds were 2,210,000 yuan for the November term and 3,760,000 yuan for the December term. 19 bonds were 2,930,000 yuan for the November term and 1,920,000 yuan for the December term. 20 bonds were 2,730,000 yuan for the November term and 2,155,000 yuan for the December term. 19 bonds were 2,140,000 yuan for the November term and 1,570,000 yuan for the December term. Demobilization bonds were 2,030,000 yuan for the November term and 1,345,000 yuan for the December term. The others were small. 96 Public bonds were 785,000 yuan for the November term and 95,000 yuan for the December term. Only 1 type of 6 customs duty bonds was offered for November term, for a total of 800,050 yuan. Customs duty bonds were 570,000 yuan. Financial bonds only had 5,000 yuan in transactions. Speaking of the change in market prices for each of the bonds in the last week, the trend was sluggish in the early part of the week. The market hovered each day. There were no major fluctuations. The price dropped a few jiao to 1 yuan during Monday and gained 5-6 jiao or so on Tuesday. It was hovering slightly lower on Wednesday. Although the League of Nations had reopened during these few days, there was little official debate concerning the Manchuria situation. The situation was very chaotic. Although the Japanese made continuous efforts to attack 黑 (Hei), they were rebuffed by Ma's army. Things were not going well. There were no major changes in other respects. The Japanese coal transport and the Tianjin riot had gradually calmed down. The general population was in a wait and see attitude. The market was quiet and the supply and demand were even. Bond prices were as sluggish as before. After Wednesday, the situation gradually worsened. The level of panic in the population increased by the day. The stock market declined and fell sharply. On Thursday, the Japanese army's heavy attack on Hei made the situation critical. The price of 6 customs duty bonds fell more than 2 yuan. On Friday, the fall of Hei became a reality, and panic spread throughout the population. Small investors wanted to sell, but investors were waiting and seeing. Demand was small. The downward trend increased. Each fell about 2-3 yuan in a single day. Some almost fell to their limit. The trend was chaotic on the weekend days, unlike any other trend in more than a month. On the morning, the Japanese grew more ferocious and the League of Nations could do nothing. All sources of information were bad. The severity of diplomatic relations with Japan were unprecedented since the Japanese army occupied Northeast China. So, market sentiment increased, and selling was in the clear lead. It continued to get worse, and trading was suspended on 9 types during the previous two rounds of trading as a result of the major fall. In the afternoon, as the situation did not seem as bad as reported, the market stabilized slightly. Many used this to buy in while the price was low. The price increased uniformly, and the trend greatly eased. But the result when compared to the previous week was still a drop of 4-5 yuan to 8-9 yuan. Based on the current environmental situation of the bond market, if the League of Nations does not quickly come to its rescue, relations between China and Japan could be concerning, and the future is not optimistic. A chart of the high and low fluctuations in price is presented below. (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton　　Last week's yarn and cotton markets remained depressed</h3>
<p>Bids fell by 2-3 taels. The yarn market was exceptionally weak this week due to the increasingly aggressive Japanese invasion and the loss of Heihe. The financial market was extremely tight, national affairs were in distress, and actual sales were stagnant. The various groups were lifeless, and speculators competed to sell, making it even more difficult to stabilize the market. The current month broke through the 50 tael mark at the end of the week. Fortunately, the factories had low bottom stocks, which helped to keep things tight. In short, without loose silver and an unstable situation, there is very little optimism. The price of bid yarn for the current month fell by 3 taels compared to the previous week</p>

<h3>Grains: Hedxia Rice Market Slightly Recovers 3 Cents</h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, there was a considerable amount of supply from various sources, but the stock at the pier remained thin. City and rural store sales suffered from increased silver exchange rates, leading to lukewarm consumer sentiment and weak appetite. The transaction volume was similar to the previous day. Premium new japonica rice prices fell by another 3 cents. The stock of thin early rice was limited, and there were a few transactions of high-quality goods in this area. The market further declined by nearly 1 cent. Imported pointed rice was not received for several days, while Yunlu rice was still good, rising by 2 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was quiet due to Sunday. There were no telegrams from producing areas, and the Public Association's trading was sparse. The market sentiment turned weak. The transaction price for No. 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods was 10 taels, for finely ground sand white 10 taels and 5 cents, and for No. 20 sand white 9 taels and 8.5 mace. The market shape was still weak. The movement of Taikoo sugar was still smooth, and the trend was stable: B Mark 11 taels 5 mace 2.5 candareens, DY Mark 11 taels 4 mace 5 candareens, HX Mark 11 taels 3 mace 5 candareens, HM 10 taels 1 mace. The market was also flat. The number of transactions was still scarce. The opening price for top-grade rock candy green grade was 10 taels 4 mace, with little demand. The market looked good.</p>
<h3>Metals: 2.5-li Steel Sheets New Stock Arriving Soon</h3>
<p>According to news from the Tea Association yesterday, the long-awaited 2.5-li English steel sheets, a new batch, may arrive this Tuesday or Wednesday. The quantity is about five to six hundred dan, so the market will have a lively scene. Its current price is 8 taels and 5.5 mace.</p>
<h3>Black Sheet Metal Opened at Over 500 Dan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's metal trading was unusually sluggish. Apart from a few minor transactions throughout the city, there were no major deals. However, the long-quiet black sheet metal saw a purchase of 560 dan by an enamel factory yesterday, making the market somewhat active. The price for 26-inch was 11 taels and 5 mace, and for 36-inch it was 10 taels and 2.5 mace, but thick patterned sheets only opened at 9 taels and 2 to 3 mace per dan, it was said.</p>

<h3>Recollections from a Tortoiseshell Beam</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>During the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year, the Eight-Nation Alliance advanced on the capital, Yanjing, with unstoppable momentum. Only the armies of Ma Yukun and Nie Shicheng resisted the enemy around Yangliuqing, Tianjin. Nie died in battle, and Ma was left unsupported, fighting and retreating. The Qing court was caught off guard by the changes. The two emperors, along with Prince Qing, had no imperial guards or cavalry escorting them on their westward journey. The Japanese army, resenting the Boxers for killing their embassy secretary, harbored a desire for revenge. Upon the city's fall, they planned to carry out a slaughter as retribution. However, the commander of the Allied forces at the time was the German General Waldersee, who was old, virtuous, and humane. The German and Japanese armies were the first to enter the city, and Waldersee issued an order prohibiting the slaughter. The people of Yanjing were fortunate to escape the tragedy, and they vied to praise Waldersee's virtue. After entering the city, Waldersee set up a large camp in the Qing Palace, strictly guarding it to prevent the Allied forces from entering the palace to steal treasures. However, the Japanese and Russian armies occasionally took actions beyond the palace walls (as detailed in various notes). Many palace treasures flowed into Japan, and the rare treasures in their museums today were all carried away at that time. If Waldersee had not enforced the law at that time, the slaughter in Yanjing would have been no less tragic than the Ten Days of Yangzhou and the Three Massacres of Jiading, and the rare treasures in the Qing Palace would have been looted without a trace and fallen into the hands of the Japanese.</p>

<h3>Two Young Men in the Northeast</h3>
<p>On November 16th, I read in the newspaper a poem given by Yang Yunshi to Feng Yong, the last line of which is: "Two young men are the Great Wall of the Northeast." These two young men probably refer to Zhang Xueliang and Feng Yong. The latest issue of Life Weekly specially published a shocking news narrative from Huoba, published in Beiping, which describes in detail the romantic life of Zhang Xueliang in Beiping amidst the peril of national subjugation. Feng Yong of Feng Yong University also did not use the spirit of resisting Russia to resist Japan, but personally led six hundred students from the Northeast south to petition and publicize when the Ning-Yue representative conference was about to end. Petitioning and publicizing is not the inherent duty of the Great Wall! After reading these things, I felt like a bone was stuck in my throat, let me spit it out!</p>
<p>(1) Lament for Zhang Xueliang (2) Encourage Feng Yong</p>
<p>Two young men are the Great Wall of the Northeast. Two young men are the Great Wall of the Northeast.</p>
<p>The Great Wall hides by the Yellow River. The Great Wall should go to the Nen River.</p>
<p>The waters of the Yellow River can wash feet. The waters of the Nen River can wash the tassels.</p>
<p>Beauties laugh, but the people cry. The country is important, vanity is light.</p>
<p>(Note) The Nenjiang Bridge is where Ma Zhanshan's lone army fought the Japanese.</p>
<h3>General Ma, Though Defeated, Is Still Honorable</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Since ancient times, those who are content with weakness and avoid war will be defeated. Those who rely on their strength and are fond of war will also be defeated. This principle applies both at home and abroad. As for the former, having millions of soldiers but not sending a single one, watching as the beautiful country is entrusted into the hands of others, relying solely on the League of Nations' discussions as trustworthy, and the non-aggression pact as reliable, ultimately allows the Japanese barbarians to run rampant, attacking our country with arms. Seizing not only our Liaoning, but also occupying our Longjiang. The reason for the loss of territory does not lie with General Ma, who fought the Japanese with his lone army, but with those who hold military power and are oblivious. Therefore, the fall of Heilongjiang this time is different from the loss of Shenyang. As for the latter, victory and defeat are common in military affairs. Emperor Wilhelm of Germany, who was unparalleled in his time, had the potential to encompass the globe and annex the world. Who dared to stand against his might? However, he became arrogant after victories, attacking endlessly, ultimately suffering a setback and being thwarted by the Allied Powers. Relying on the sharpness of his armor, believing that he could be invincible in the world, but not knowing that repeated use inevitably dulls and breaks it. Now, the violent Japan of East Asia is just a German Empire of the East. Even if General Ma runs out of ammunition and is cut off from reinforcements, he must roll up his armor and retreat to plan another battle from behind the city, hoping to recover. However, compared to those who possess great armies but sit idly by, facing the enemy at the city but remaining helpless, yet shamelessly boasting to others that they adhere to a policy of non-resistance, the spirit of all soldiers in our country has been greatly uplifted. What is lacking is the ability to not only be entrusted with the important task of serving the country, but also to operate the machinery of the headquarters. The border sent out a warning, deafening, but only relying on the single division outside the gate to face the enemy alone. Only after hearing the news did the message of heading north to support arrive. Those who seize the opportunity to seek merit and those who forget themselves are already vastly different. How much more so are those who embellish governance or perfunctorily respond to the enemy unable to be seen clearly by the people of the country? It is said, "When a gentleman hears the sound of drums, he thinks of the ministers and generals outside the city." I do not know what the current authorities are dreaming of. What is even more ridiculous is the weakness of the masses, thinking that whether Heihe can be protected or not depends solely on the provisions. Therefore, they use money to infiltrate it, but they do not know that these piles of money are not enough to resist the Japanese. Even if General Ma gets it, it is useless. Think about what is lacking when trapped in an encirclement. Alas, I say that General Ma's defeat in this battle is not General Ma's defeat. It is the defeat of our country from top to bottom. How magnificent! General Ma, though defeated, is still honorable. I respect General Ma. I love General Ma. I dare to tell those who govern the army and resist Japan one word: "Only follow the lead of General Ma."</p>
<h3>Record of Survival After the Calamity</h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>Recently, I read the Zhengyi Bao, which contained Fan Zhongqiao's eyewitness account of the Japanese army's atrocities and his experience of being captured and returning alive. I have excerpted and translated it below to show the cruelty of the Japanese army and to mourn for our compatriots in the East Province.</p>
<h3>Columbus Expelled from America</h3>
<p>— Yi Wei Sheng</p>
<p>Columbus' discovery of America is already well known to the world. Commentators invariably admire his perseverance and the greatness of his success. However, the fact that this first person to discover America was also the first person to be expelled from America is known to very few. Therefore, I record the matter as follows:</p>
<p>On March 21, 1499, Commander Bobadilla of Calatrava was ordered by the English court to investigate Columbus's imprisonment. This was because Columbus was accused of greed, mistreatment of scholars, and harboring ambitions to elevate himself to the status of emperor. Bobadilla set out from England in August 1500 and arrived in America in October. After confirming that the accusations against Columbus were not false, the verdict was decided. Columbus was shackled and banished from America, never to set foot again on the land of the New World he had discovered himself, and lost all his public rights in America. The small sailboat he used to leave the country was named Gorda. This was the first person to be expelled from America since the history of America, and this person happened to be the first person to discover America himself. Isn't it an anomaly?</p>
<p>China: The lion loves peace. Ma Zhanshan's one paw seems to awaken, seems to move the entire nation and the national government. When will it awaken? When will it move? The attention and judgment of the world will shift accordingly. May I ask all the citizens and the two old men of Huafeng whether they agree to comfort the good men of the Northeast? Xin Ren Winter Mutual Book.</p>
<p>I (Fan's self-description, the following follows this) was ordered by the Foreign Affairs Committee to go from Jilin to Changchun to investigate the truth of the Japanese army's atrocities. After completing the report, I was afraid that the Japanese army would search for it and hid it in my shoes. There were very few Chinese in the carriage. The two Japanese soldiers sitting to my right and the several Japanese facing me all had mean and sneaky appearances. What they were talking about was the issue of the East Province. I had no intention of listening.</p>
<p>When the carriage reached Hada Bay, sixty li away from Jilin, the two Japanese soldiers suddenly stood up and pointed their bayonets at me (the tip of the bayonet was only three inches from my chest), asking me my destination, occupation, and what I was carrying. I had just answered that I was returning to my hometown of Jilin when another Japanese soldier suddenly accused me of being impolite because I had answered while sitting and not standing up. He loudly said, "When you speak to a Japanese person, you must stand up and show respect. Stand up quickly, or the bayonet will pierce your chest!" Under this threat, I knew that resistance was useless, so I had no choice but to stand up. He then threw my hat on the ground and began searching. Although I was afraid that the report would be searched away by them, I dared not show it on my face and calmly let them search. Fortunately, they did not discover it.</p>
<p>When the carriage arrived in Jilin, I was searched again. They kicked me because they still found nothing, ordering me to leave quickly. I hired a carriage to go to a friend's house. Japanese soldiers searching Chinese people were everywhere on the street. Two days later, I returned to Changchun.</p>
<p>I stayed in Changchun for about ten days. The Japanese army announced that all members of the Foreign Affairs Committee were to be arrested. I avoided going to Jilin and witnessed the tragic murder of Military Law Committee Chairman Han and the arrest of Foreign Affairs Committee Member Xu, who was released by Xi Qia. On October 13, the situation became increasingly tense. I thought that Jilin was not a place to stay for long, so I went to the train station to take a train to avoid going elsewhere. Passing through Xinkaimen (the name of a gate in Jilin City), the Japanese army set up machine guns at the gate to search pedestrians. All Chinese people, regardless of gender, could not be spared. It was common for the Japanese army to occasionally get excited and shoot Chinese people to death. The Japanese army arrested me because I was wearing a Western suit but Chinese shoes, thinking that it was inappropriate. Fortunately, I was released by using my silver tongue. Then I came to Shanghai via Dalian.</p>
<p>The following is a description of the abuse and killing of others by the Japanese army that I witnessed.</p>
<p>1. Military Law Committee Chairman Han had always hated Japanese and Korean people. After Jilin fell, Han was captured by the Japanese army, tied up, and placed in prison. First, he was brutally beaten, then stabbed with bayonets, and then shot in non-fatal places. Finally, Han was thrown into the fire and burned to death. The tragedy was extremely heartbreaking.</p>
<p>2. Foreign Affairs Committee Member Xu had a very close friendship with Xi Qia. After being captured by the Japanese, he was interceded for by Xi Qia, and he used all his private property to redeem his life. He escaped to Dalian but was arrested again and is likely to have been killed.</p>
<p>3. On October 9, a female student was raped and killed by the Japanese army. Countless people in the East Province shared the same fate as this female student. Although only she witnessed it, it is enough to represent all the behavior of the Japanese army towards our female compatriots.</p>
<p>4. The Changchun Provincial Party Department was destroyed. Party members and students were especially targeted by the Japanese army, so casualties were not few. On October 11, the US consul went from Jilin to Changchun to inspect the truth of the incident. The Japanese army issued an order stating that except for Xi Qia, no Chinese person was allowed to entertain the US consul. The US consul stayed at the home of Hua Youronghou, a Japanese friend, and the Japanese learned about it, so they sent troops to interrogate Ronghou. Fortunately, the US consul heard the news and left beforehand. Although Ronghou did not suffer any punishment, he could no longer move freely after that.</p>

<h3>The Country Bumpkin Goes to Shanghai Again (25)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The country bumpkin walked into the Mei Garden and almost retreated. Originally, the Mei Garden Restaurant was urban but had garden scenery. Inside were arranged pavilions and terraces, so he said that the place was indeed a garden. He also saw a large iron cage at the entrance. In the large iron cage was coiled a large snake. There were also several small iron cages, in which were various small snakes. He also saw several large vats arranged in front of the door, each vat also containing aquatic animals. Some vats contained several black fish; some vats contained several large turtles, with a red strip pasted on them, writing the line, "Newly Arrived Extremely Large Little Lucky Ones"; some vats contained things like seals and sea dogs. Therefore, the country bumpkin hesitated and dared not enter, thinking that he had walked into a zoo.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to withdraw, a person wearing a snow-white apron came to greet him. "Please sit over here," pointing to an empty seat over there.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin looked closely and saw that it was a hall with scattered seats. Several groups of people were eating there, some in groups of three, some in groups of two, and some alone. The country bumpkin was then relieved, this was indeed a place to eat. He followed the seat assigned by the waiter and sat down.</p>
<p>The waiters placed the cups and chopsticks down. The country bumpkin saw a pair of ivory chopsticks. On the ivory chopsticks was also engraved the name of the restaurant. He thought that Shanghai people were very thorough, engraving the name so that even if a thief stole them, it would be useless. But what if the words on the chopsticks were erased? He was worrying alone about the restaurant people when the waiter took out a white paper and a pencil and placed them in front of the country bumpkin. The country bumpkin could not help but feel suspicious again:</p>
<p>"Eh! What is this for! Could it be that you have to do a 'paper head' (Note 6) and draw a monogram even when eating?"</p>
<p>Originally, the country bumpkin had seen people writing in small teahouses in the countryside, and there were many drawings. They were all gathered there. These were all a group of country bumpkins, selling and buying land and property, and they would make a contract in the small teahouse, and everyone would sign it. He had only seen writing in public places like this, so when the waiter brought the paper and pencil, he mistakenly thought he was being asked to do a "paper head".</p>
<p>"Please order your dishes," the waiter said, seeing the country bumpkin staring blankly at the paper and pencil, urging him in Shanghai dialect with a Cantonese accent.</p>
<p>"I don't know what dishes you have?" The country bumpkin then knew that the paper and pencil were for ordering dishes. "We have newly arrived conch," the waiter said, reporting what he considered to be fresh dishes.</p>
<p>"Sounding gong? How strange! Have I walked into a copper shop?"</p>
<p>[Note 6] In the countryside, writing a contract is called doing a "paper head".</p>

<h3>Gilin People's Representatives Appeal to the Fourth National Congress</h3>
<p>Presenting Ten Matters of Grievance</p>
<p>Hu Tigan and Jiang Songnian, representatives of the Jilin people residing in Shanghai, submitted a letter yesterday to all delegates attending the Fourth National Congress in Nanjing, stating: "To all esteemed gentlemen attending the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang of China: Incompetent officials are ruining the country, and the thirty million people of the Northeast have been lost, trapped amidst fleeing soldiers, bandits, and the trampling of imperialists. They cannot live, nor can they die. They can only swallow their anger and coexist with murder, arson, destruction, rape, and plunder. You gentlemen, who take saving the nation and its people as your sacred duty, have you heard of this? It has been over fifty days since the Northeast was lost. Aside from the thirty million people who deserve to suffer the consequences, is there not a single person responsible? The so-called deputy commander and the so-called provincial chairman are loitering in Tianjin and Qiqiharu, but we have not heard of them firing a single arrow at the enemy, nor have we heard of them sending a single official to comfort our compatriots. Nor have we heard of any comrades from the Party coming forward to advocate for or appeal on behalf of the officials who lost the battle and the people who are suffering. Alas, what have the people of the Northeast done to the nation that they are so disregarded by all parties? In the areas of Liaoning and Jilin provinces that have already been occupied by the Japanese army, the cruelty of the Japanese army is beyond words. In the vast majority of areas where the Japanese army has not yet arrived, the National Army is in disarray, and important figures have fled thousands of miles away to Tianjin and Qiqiharu. Politics has ceased, and everything has fallen into a state of chaos. The soldiers are in disarray even if they are not supposed to be, and the people are bandits even if they are not supposed to be. In this area, all aspects of humanity and human nature have gone into hiding, replaced by bestiality and violence. Recently, a bloody letter was delivered from Jilin, stating that there are no virgins along the roads, and women under the age of forty cannot escape rape, especially in the villages and towns of Jilin, Changchun, Nong'an, Dehui, Fuyu, Shuangcheng, and other counties. Alas, what kind of world is this? What kind of life is this? Majestic Heaven above, the Premier beholds. The legacy of peace, struggle, and saving China still echoes in our ears. After your coffee breaks, do you gentlemen and important figures not have the time to ask about the responsibility for this matter and its aftermath? The officials of the Northeast have always been skilled in greed and corruption. In addition to directly extorting and exploiting, they also made extensive use of the Nai Yongheng Official Bank, the Bianye Bank, and the Guangxin Company to issue excessive amounts of paper money, profiting from it. Officials received dividends, and the people suffered. Once the incident occurred, the paper money in the market was driven out by Japanese gold notes. Even within the borders of our country, it is not easy to find a single national currency. Millions of people have been bankrupted and separated from each other. Without waiting for the arrival of the Japanese army, the society of the Northeast was already like rotten wood waiting to be swept away. What have the people of the Northeast done to the nation? They have always fulfilled their responsibilities to the nation, and they believe they have done no less than any other region. However, the government treats them with perfunctory measures, regarding the Northeast as irrelevant to the grand strategy of the revolution, only knowing how to perfunctorily seek temporary peace and neglecting the well-being of the people and the safety of the nation. The people groan and writhe in the midst of fire and water, respectfully and reverently accepting the exploitation of corrupt officials, yet they do not complain or get angry, because of the Party and the nation, believing that they would not be abandoned and that they would soon be saved based on the Premier's principles and spirit. However, month after month, year after year, the corruption, incompetence, darkness, and self-interest of the Northeast's politics remain the same. Even when the strong enemy wields a knife and breaks into the house, the city gates are not closed, the camps are not defended, and they abandon their armor and drag their weapons, leaving everything to the enemy. The strategic passes of Liaoning and Jilin were lost one after another. Within a few thousand miles, there was no trace of gray-clad soldiers or the flag of the Party and the nation. But this is still acceptable. Even though the East Corner has been lost, we still hope to bravely strive for recovery and make amends for our sins, and we can still achieve victory in the end. However, for more than a month, not only has there been no military preparation for recovery or plans to restore our territory to thank the people, but there has not even been empty talk of taking the blame and comforting the people. The conscience of those in charge will never appear, and the laws of the country cannot be applied to those in power. Then, what dare the common people, other than die and loyally become slaves of a fallen nation, privately discuss? If the Northeast is only a Northeast problem, then it is not worth paying much attention to. Recently, the Tianjin Incident broke out, Puyi proclaimed himself emperor, Tianjin was placed under martial law, and the turmoil has not ceased. It seems that the secret decision of 'letting things slide' cannot solve the problem. In the past, during the Sino-Russian War, heavy troops were stationed at Shanhaiguan. Recently, Liaoning and Jilin have fallen, and important figures are hiding in Tianjin and Qiqiharu. Now, the forces of Japanese imperialism have crossed Shanhaiguan and are surging towards the hinterland. Where will the heavy troops be stationed in the future? Where will the residences be chosen in the future? The authorities do not think of the people, but the people are constantly thinking of the authorities. Now that the Shanghai Peace Conference has been completed, comrades in the Party share the concern for the loss of territory, abandoning prejudices to jointly face the national crisis and convening the Fourth National Congress to concentrate political views and lay the foundation for governance. In the future, breaking the deadlock and completing the Three Principles of the People depend entirely on this conference. Therefore, we dare to take this opportunity, with tears in our eyes and choked voices, to appeal about the Northeast issue before you gentlemen: (1) Dismiss and punish all responsible personnel in the Northeast, both high and low, to apologize to the people of the nation and to warn future generations. (2) Appoint virtuous and capable individuals to effectively recover the lost territory and avenge the national humiliation. (3) Determine a national defense plan for the eastern provinces to prevent foreign aggression. (4) Rectify the financial system of the eastern provinces to relieve the people's suffering. (5) Determine a plan for the eastern provinces to absorb foreign investment to break the monopolistic power of Japanese imperialism. (6) Determine and publicize methods for resolving urgent cases with Japan in the eastern provinces so that the people of the nation can understand the path and make efforts. (7) Grant amnesty to those wrongly imprisoned in the eastern provinces to appease public opinion and start anew with the people. (8) Recover the Japanese concession in Tianjin to protect the security of North China. (9) Quickly assist Ma Zhanshan to protect the territory of Heilongjiang Province. The future fate of China depends on the results of this conference, the value of this conference, and how you gentlemen advocate for the Northeast issue. We deeply hope that you gentlemen will remember (that you are members of the Kuomintang) and even more remember (that you are members of the Kuomintang of China), how to stand and how to strive. The teachings and legacy are all models. As the poem says, '(Looking up to Nanshan, the rocks are steep. The glorious teacher and leader, the people all look up to you.)' The people also look up to you gentlemen. The nation is broken, and the family is destroyed. It is a tragic fate. The words are urgent and sincere. We hope you will understand. Hu Tigan and Jiang Songnian, representatives of the Jilin people, respectfully bow."</p>
<h3>Zhang and Li Arrive in Shanghai to Visit Wang</h3>
<p>Representing the Fourth National Congress to Urge Wang and Hu to Go to Nanjing</p>
<p>Wang and Others Request Facilities for Zhang Fakui</p>
<p>The Central Government Plans to Organize a National Crisis Committee</p>
<p>Zhang Ji and Li Shizeng, representatives from Nanjing, arrived in Shanghai on the express train from Nanjing-Shanghai at around 8:00 a.m. yesterday and returned to their residences to rest. At around 10:00 a.m., the two visited Wang Jingwei and talked for about forty minutes and also met with Ma Chaojun and Tan Zhen. In addition to representing the Nanjing Fourth National Congress to urge Wang and Hu to go to Nanjing, Wang and Ma expressed to Zhang and others that if Zhang Fakui were to assist Hei Ma, they would request that the Nanjing side provide him with facilities. As for the content discussed by the Guangdong representatives at their meeting in Shanghai the previous night, Ma Chaojun told a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter that the most important part of the research during the meeting last night was the matter of Zhang Fakui's assistance to Hei Ma. The internal problems have been completely agreed upon by both parties, but the results of the research have not been completely determined. According to another report, the Nanjing side is now planning to establish a National Crisis Committee to concentrate the talents of the whole country and deal with foreign affairs in a unified manner. It is heard that Zhang and others came to Shanghai with this intention to urge Wang and Hu to go to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Fourth First Session of the Central Executive Committee - Both Sides Negotiate the Location</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Side Naturally Advocates Convening in the Capital</p>
<p>Although the Guangdong Side Advocated Holding It in Shanghai, They Did Not Insist</p>
<p>The Nanjing side has held the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang and has now elected the members of the Fourth Central Executive Supervisory Committee in order. The Guangdong Fourth National Congress will also elect members of the Central Executive Supervisory Committee within days. After the election is completed by both sides, if the list of candidates elected by both sides is the same and there are no differences, the first plenary session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee can be held on a selected date. A few days ago, representatives from both Nanjing and Guangdong held a peace preparatory meeting in Shanghai and decided that all proposals of the Fourth National Congress of both sides should be submitted to the Fourth Central Executive Committee for handling at its first meeting. It was also decided that the Organizational Law of the National Government should be revised by the Fourth First Plenary Session, so the task of the Fourth First Plenary Session is extremely important. All matters of national importance will be resolved at this meeting. Regarding the location of this meeting, according to the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, who inquired with a certain important person yesterday (the 22nd), the important person said that the Nanjing side naturally advocated holding the Fourth First Plenary Session in the capital, and many important people from the Guangdong side advocated holding it in Shanghai, but they did not insist on this. The Nanjing and Guangdong sides are currently negotiating, and after sincere contact, the opinions of both sides should be able to reach a consensus immediately.</p>
<h3>Military Police Corps Joint Office - Starts Work Today</h3>
<p>Address: Huzhou Guild Hall</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to ensure effective liaison between the military, police, and corps, have specially organized a temporary joint office for the military, police, and corps in this city.

<h3>Hu Hanmin Temporarily Does Not Go to Guangdong</h3>

<p>Yesterday, He Replied to the Guangdong Fourth National Congress by Telegram</p>

<h3>The Guangdong Fourth National Congress Must Hold Elections After the 24th</h3>
<p>Wang Zou Wu Telegraphed the Ningbo Peace Conference Representatives Yesterday</p>
<p>Hoping that the Ningbo Conference Would Delay Closing to Achieve Consistency</p>
<p>The Nanjing Fourth National Congress, hoping to elect members of the Central Executive Supervisory Committee at the same time as the Guangdong Fourth National Congress, previously sent Chen Mingshu to Shanghai to contact Wang Jingwei and other Guangdong Peace Conference representatives staying in Shanghai, who telegraphed the Guangdong Fourth National Congress for instructions. It is now learned that if the Guangdong Fourth National Congress cannot catch up as scheduled, it will have to hold elections after the 24th at the earliest. It was reported to Wang and others by telegram the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Wang Zou Wu immediately telegraphed Chen Mingshu and the Ningbo Peace Conference representatives Cai Li Zhang Wu to report the above situation. The telegram is attached as follows:</p>
<p>To Chen Mingshu Telegram: Nanjing Mr. Chen Zhenru, I have received Guangzhou's reply: I have received the Qiaowu telegram. It is impossible to complete the election as scheduled. It must be held after the 24th at the earliest. Please forward it to the Ningbo side, Ke, Fan, Ren, Hao, Youyin, etc. Sincerely, Wang Zhaoming, Zou Lu, Wu Chaochu, Ge Xu.</p>
<p>To Cai Zhang et al. Telegram: Nanjing Mr. Cai Zimin, Li Shizeng, Zhang Puquan, Wu Tiecheng, all gentlemen, I have received the close Gehai respectfully. Brother Zhesheng and others telegraphed that the Guangdong meeting must be held after the 24th at the earliest before elections can be held. I have already reported it by telegram, and I think you have received it. It seems appropriate for the Ningbo meeting to postpone its closing so that the elections can be consistent. The reason why the Guangdong meeting was delayed until the 18th was to wait for Brother Zhesheng and others to return to Guangdong to report. Please understand. How do you wish to reply? Wang Zhaoming, Zou Lu, Wu Chaochu, Ma Yiyi.</p>
<h3>Three Important Telegrams from Women's Organizations</h3>
<p>Requesting the Early Recovery of the Lost Territory in the Northeast The Shanghai Women's Relief Association telegraphed: To all gentlemen of the Fourth National Congress, it has been more than ten days since the opening of the congress. Setting the national policy early is what all people expect. However, before the upright arguments are over, the foreign invaders are becoming more urgent. The national affairs have deteriorated to this point. Who is responsible for this disaster? The people have complaints. For the sake of you gentlemen and for the sake of the survival of our entire nation, you should immediately make a decisive decision on military and diplomatic affairs, take effective control with strict means, so that national affairs can be followed and the lost land can be recovered as soon as possible. Do not delay and sit idly by, making mistake after mistake, so that half of the mountains and rivers of our Northeast will be lost at the hands of a few people. The telegram is urgent, and we pray endlessly. Shanghai Women's Relief Association, Kou, Yang.</p>
<p>Supporting Chairman Jiang's Dedication to the Party and the Nation The Shanghai Women's Relief Association telegraphed: To Nanjing National Government Chairman Jiang, the invading Japanese are encroaching on China, and the atmosphere of war is brewing. The drums of war are becoming more urgent. They have already occupied Liaoning and Jilin and have now captured Heilongjiang. They are making progress step by step and are acting recklessly. Ma Zhanshan, with his isolated and unsupported forces, fought hard for several weeks. When food and ammunition ran out, half of the mountains and rivers of the Northeast fell into the hands of the Japanese invaders. When the bad news came, we shed tears of blood. Now, I have learned that Your Excellency reported in the Fourth National Congress that you will dedicate yourself to the Party and the nation and recover the territory. Upon hearing this, the whole country admires you. I hope that you will lead a large army with an iron-blooded spirit, fight to the end, quell the turmoil, and restore the rivers and mountains. All of our people swear to be your backing, preferring to die rather than live in dishonor. I especially hope that Your Excellency will make a decisive decision and send troops quickly. The nation's survival and death are intertwined. The great righteousness lies in this one action. The telegram is urgent, and we pray endlessly. Shanghai Women's Relief Association, Kou, Yang.</p>
<p>Opposing Zhang Xueliang's Election as a Supervisory Committee Member The Chinese Women's Political Participation Association circulated a telegram: To all newspapers in Shanghai and to all levels of Party departments, mass organizations, elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters at home and abroad, I have learned from the newspapers that Zhang Xueliang was elected as a member of the Supervisory Committee at the Fourth National Congress, and I am very upset. Zhang Xueliang held a policy of non-resistance, losing three provinces, harming the people and the nation, and causing an unprecedented shame. The government did not punish him. Originally, I expected him to atone for his sins. However, I do not know what kind of hearts the electors have, what kind of views the review committee has. Even if they do not consider the people of the whole country or their own personality, are they not afraid of the views of the League of Nations and the comments of foreign newspapers? Moreover, what kind of dignity does the Kuomintang have, and what kind of position does a supervisor have? If all compatriots recognize Xueliang's election, it is equivalent to willingly becoming a slave of a fallen nation. If they remain silent, it means that they are willing to cede land to Japan. Alas, the culprit is elected, where is the justice? The people of the country are silent, what is left of their courage? I hereby cry out to all compatriots across the country to rise up and voice their support, requesting the Central Party Department, the National Government, and the Supervisory Yuan to deny his election and punish him according to the facts of Zhang Xueliang's crimes, so that the League of Nations knows that the hearts of our people are not dead and that justice cannot be extinguished, which can serve as a diplomatic backing in case of emergency. The telegram is full of tears, and I do not know what to say. Wang Ruizhu, Wang Liming, Liu Jichen, etc., Yang Kou.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Requesting the Dismissal and Punishment of Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Municipal Joint District Branch</p>
<p>The district branches of the Shanghai Municipal People's United Association telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying: "Zhang Xueliang sat idly by as the Japanese invaders invaded and occupied the Northeast, humiliating the country and losing territory, abandoning his duties. The vast territory of Liaoning and Jilin was lost in one day. The Hei Ma army of Heilongjiang Province fought against Japan alone, loyal to the borderland. Zhang Xueliang failed to provide assistance, resulting in the loss of the great three provinces. The territory of the three provinces was almost lost by the Northeastern generals. If Zhang Xueliang can recognize his mistakes and have a little conscience to save the country, he should go to Hei with his sins to assist, restore the lost territory in the Northeast, and strive to improve himself. The people of the whole country may be able to understand his situation. Now he is still idle, turning a deaf ear. He only knows how to appeal to the League of Nations. Alas, the country will no longer be a country. How can we allow the Japanese invaders to do whatever they want? I hope that our government will rectify the discipline internally and punish Zhang Xueliang according to the national law to apologize to the world and calm the public's anger. Implement a revolutionary policy towards Japan with a fearless spirit. Please General Commander Jiang go north to dedicate himself to saving the country and fulfill his duties. The people have always believed in and resolved to coexist and perish with the country and give it quick implementation. When the country is in trouble, the people will make any sacrifice, obeying only the government's orders. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 15th, 19th, and 26th district branches of the Shanghai Municipal People's United Association, together, Kou, Yang."</p>
<p>The 25th district branch and the Volunteer Army Committee of the Shanghai Special District Municipal People's United Association issued a circular saying that Deputy Commander Zhang did not assist Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang: "When the country is in great difficulty, anyone with a conscience should repent, eliminate all personal prejudices, and do their utmost to fulfill their duties to defend the borderland and face the people of the country. Who knows that this time the Japanese invaded the East Province, they did not resist at all, putting their compatriots in a fiery pit and treating the land like worn-out shoes, forgetting that there is such a thing as shame in the world. General Ma fought alone in Hei, engaging in close combat for weeks, but he did not send a grain of food or a bullet, watching him lose. When the bad news came, the whole country was saddened and angry. The thieves who stole the country must be punished by everyone. If they do not hide, the ax will be upon them. The Executive Committee and the Volunteer Army Committee of the 25th District Branch of the Municipal Federation, Yang Yin."</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Luo Qinghua Discusses Military Preparations Funds for Japan</h3>
<p>Raising Funds for the Entire Army's Salaries and Provisions is the Sole Responsibility of the Nation</p>
<p>According to reports, Mr. Luo Qinghua, Executive Committee member of the City Chamber of Commerce, proposed raising military preparations funds for Japan. This has been approved by the City Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee. A reporter from Shanghai News, eager to understand the content and methods, specially visited Mr. Luo to inquire about the details. Mr. Luo received him and showed the original proposal, which stated: Since the brutal Japanese invasion of our Northeast, the situation on the border has become increasingly urgent. The League of Nations cannot be relied upon, and war is ultimately unavoidable. If preparations are not made urgently, I fear that once war begins, salaries and provisions will be exhausted, and we will repeat the mistakes of General Ma Zhanshan. Therefore, based on the idea of preparing for the unexpected, I propose raising military preparations funds for Japan and propose three methods: (1) The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce should notify all industries and businesses in the city and people from all walks of life at home and abroad to launch a fundraising campaign. (2) The City Chamber of Commerce should designate financial institutions to collect funds on its behalf and issue receipts. (3) This preparation fund should be used exclusively for rewarding soldiers and assisting with salaries and provisions during wartime operations against Japan, and should not be used for other purposes. If the Japanese army withdraws from the Northeast and war between China and Japan is avoided, this preparation fund will be returned in full to the original owners. Furthermore, according to Mr. Luo's explanation of his intentions: (1) Since General Ma Zhanshan bravely resisted the enemy, the people across the country have enthusiastically supported him, demonstrating that the heart of the nation has not died. However, only when the battle is critical do we see appeals for support. Providing aid in an emergency, while the intention is commendable, has many drawbacks, like digging a well only when thirsty. This is proven by the fact that General Ma did not receive funds wired to Heilongjiang this time. (2) The ambitions of brutal Japan are growing ever more intense. For the sake of the survival of the Chinese nation, there is no other way out than war. However, when a major war begins, the area will be vast, and social order will inevitably undergo abnormal changes. I deeply fear that there will not be sufficient time to raise funds at that time. Therefore, it is necessary to raise preparation funds in advance. (3) If, due to insufficient salaries and provisions, the war against Japan repeats the mistakes of Heilongjiang Province, then the lives and property of the entire Chinese nation will inevitably be destroyed together. Therefore, I am confident that this preparation fund, since it is specifically for use in the war against Japan, will be supported by compatriots at home and abroad. (4) My suggestion has been approved by the Executive Committee of the City Chamber of Commerce, which has instructed the Standing Committee to designate fundraising institutions. It will be implemented soon. I hope that the public opinion circles will give it as much publicity as possible and, with a spirit of prompt action, work together to plan for a rainy day.</p>
<p>After the Executive Committee of the City Chamber of Commerce passed Mr. Luo Qinghua's proposal to raise military preparations funds for Japan, the detailed fundraising methods are yet to be decided and announced by the Standing Committee of the Chamber. However, the Silk and Satin Trade Association has already pledged to donate 5,000 yuan, and the Mineral Ash Factory Trade Association has already pledged to donate 3,000 yuan. Meanwhile, they are actively soliciting donations from their members. Other trade associations are also actively raising funds.</p>
<h3>National Medical Association Raises National Salvation Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Medical Association, concerned that General Ma Zhanshan's isolated army was facing the danger of running out of salaries and provisions, had its executive and supervisory committee members donate more than 1,000 yuan on the spot. Now, in view of the possibility that the war may expand, it has convened an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, resolving to change the funds donated by members to national salvation funds. At the same time, a fundraising committee was established, assigning routes and dividing areas for collection. Each fundraising committee member will carry the association's official letter, certificate, and receipt book to solicit donations, collect and save them in advance, so that they can be dealt with urgently when necessary.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Reply to the Southern Fujian Association</h3>
<p>The Southern Fujian Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang requesting assistance for Chairman Ma Zhanshan. Yesterday, they received the following reply: To the Southern Fujian Association in Shanghai, Your telegram has been received and read with care. Your shared goal of resisting the enemy is deeply admired. Since the beginning of the Japanese invasion of the Northeast, our army has been actively coordinating all defenses. Since I telegraphed Chairman Ma to enter the province and supervise the troops, I have been planning day and night to increase reinforcements and provide aid, without neglecting sleep or food. I am obligated to defend and guard, and military planning requires careful consideration. Moreover, Chairman Ma and the combat generals have known each other for many years or have shared hardships for a long time. How can public and private feelings allow me to recklessly send a partial force to face a strong enemy alone? (The original telegram is recorded in full) I had already ordered the troops stationed in Harbin, Suo, Hu, and Hai to be under the command of Chairman Ma and to act as appropriate. However, because it concerned military secrets, I did not announce it at the time. As for Heilongjiang Province being 3,000 miles away, with transportation usually relying only on the Taoang Railway Line, it has been completely blocked by the Japanese since the Shenyang Incident, and there is no other way to transport supplies. The difficulty in transporting them is well known. I have not dared to lag behind others in donating money. I am deeply grateful for your advice, which I will follow. I am sending a special thank you and expressing my sincerity. Please understand. Zhang Xueliang, secret.</p>
<h3>Yu Fengzhi's Reply to the Linglong Society</h3>
<p>The Linglong Women's Magazine Society telegraphed Yu Fengzhi, requesting that she urge Vice Zhang to send troops quickly to rescue Ma Zhanshan. Recently, Yu's reply telegram was received, stating that the supporting troops had already set off, and salaries, provisions, medicine, and ammunition had also been transported. However, due to road repairs and high mountains, it will inevitably take time to arrive.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary People's Whereabouts</h3>

<h3>Lin Zhiyuan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Postal Workers' Volunteer Army Held a Grand Drill Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand People Marched in Formation</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army has been very well-organized. There are more than 800 members, divided into the North and South Districts, practicing daily. Officers and members have not stopped. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the entire team, as well as the women's ambulance team, the postal workers' band, the postal workers' boy scouts, the battlefield service team, and the postal workers' transportation team, totaling more than 1,000 people, held a grand drill on the playground next to the World Theater on Qingyun Road, Zhabei. The situation was extremely enthusiastic and tragic. The details are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Drill Team: The army consists of one regiment, divided into two battalions, each battalion divided into three companies, and each company divided into three platoons. In total, there are more than 800 officers and members in the regimental headquarters and the regiment. On this day, starting at 1:00 PM, the members arrived at the field one after another and joined their respective teams. At 2:00 PM, the commander-in-chief Zhang Kechang, deputy commander Huang Gongfu, Cheng Zuoying Battalion Commander Zhu Xuefan, Fu Dewei, Party Representative Lu Jingshi, Shanghai Postmaster Chapeilin, and officers of the regimental headquarters arrived on time. Under the command of chief instructor Lu Keming, the entire team stood at attention and saluted. The military band played music. After the commander-in-chief inspected the parade, the drill began, and the commander-in-chief gave a speech (the speech is recorded later). After the speech, the parade began.</p>
<p>Maintaining Order at the Meeting Place: Starting at 1:00 PM, there were many spectators on Xibaoxing Road, Qingyun Road, and around the playground. Postal workers' boy scouts, battlefield service teams, postal workers' transportation teams, and 50 police officers from the 5th District of the Public Security Bureau were deployed inside and outside to maintain order.</p>
<p>Commander's Speech: Commander-in-chief Zhang Kechang delivered a speech to the entire team, stating that since Japan unreasonably occupied our Northeast, our people have expressed grief and indignation, and have risen up together, sharing the same hatred against the enemy. Under the brutal Japanese invasion, our postal workers have organized a volunteer army, embracing the spirit of sacrifice and preparing for a final bloody battle with the brutal Japanese to wash away the shame for the country and win glory for the nation. He hopes that his colleagues will work hard, be determined to sacrifice themselves for the country, and vow to achieve the goal of overthrowing Japanese imperialism. The weather was gloomy that day, and all the officers and soldiers listened solemnly, and were all moved by it.</p>
<p>Parade Route: The parade was led by the postal workers' transportation team, followed by the postal workers' band, the regimental flag, the commander and officers, the entire volunteer army, the women's ambulance team, the postal workers' boy scouts, and the battlefield service team. The parade started from the playground, exited Xibaoxing Road, passed Baoshan Road, passed the North Station, passed Xinmin Road, went north, passed Qiujiang Road, and reached the regimental headquarters at Xingjiaqiao Road to disband. The total distance was more than ten miles. The military appearance was very impressive. The film company also took movies on the spot, and the spectators blocked the road. The postal workers' transportation team maintained order along the way.</p>
<h3>Educational Circles Oppose the Sale of Sealed Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Educational Circles National Salvation Joint Association sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: Greetings, our country has been under the oppression and humiliation of brutal Japan for nearly 30 years. This time, taking advantage of our floods, the September 18th Incident suddenly occurred. Half of the mountains and rivers of the Northeast, and more than 30 million compatriots, have been lost to the enemy's iron hooves. Our country and nation have reached the most critical moment. Appeals to justice have been hopeless, and international sanctions are unlikely. Our last remaining weapon is to thoroughly reject Japanese goods and sever economic relations with Japan, using economic strikes to promote the final awakening of the Japanese people. This method is the most peaceful and legitimate, and it is also the most effective countermeasure for our country to resist violence and save the country. In the past, there have been eight boycotts of Japanese goods, each of which ended with a lack of follow-through or poorly designed plans, resulting in failure and ridicule from brutal Japan, and being mocked as a "child's disease." This time, compatriots across the country, fearing the imminent demise of the country, are using their patriotic enthusiasm, strict organization, thorough methods, and severe rejection of Japanese goods to revitalize our national spirit and wash away our shame. It is now gradually showing real results. However, recently, I suddenly heard that someone, using the excuse of financial congestion, suggested that the sealed enemy goods be sold publicly. Such a proposal, if not insane, is for other purposes. When the country is in such danger, all the people of the country have the obligation to spare no sacrifice to jointly pursue any method that can resist violence and save ourselves. How much are the sealed enemy goods worth? Can we not cope with them by exhausting our national strength, and must we sell them publicly to cool the hot blood of our people, destroy the spirit of our nation, open the door to buying and selling enemy goods, create endless malpractices, and make our last remaining weapon impossible to maintain, and again give the Japanese people the opportunity to insult and ridicule us? Those who hold this view are no different from publicly selling the entire personality and life of the nation. The country is in danger! The enemy is deep! Resisting violence and saving ourselves is the last remaining opportunity. Compatriots, let us all act according to our conscience and fight together. Unless we wait until Japan fulfills its promise to withdraw its troops, or the government announces the severance of diplomatic relations, can we consider ways to dredge them. At this time, we will resolutely oppose any method of selling enemy goods. We hereby inform you and hope you will take note and jointly preside over this matter.</p>
<h3>Will Inspect Unregistered Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Notifies Various Industries to Investigate</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the trade associations yesterday, stating: In accordance with a letter from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, according to the Huxi Inspection Office, it plans to start inspecting unregistered Japanese goods in the stores within its jurisdiction in the near future, in order to implement its proposals and facilitate anti-Japanese efforts. However, as the inspection involves entering stores, it is deeply feared that misunderstandings will occur. Please send a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce as soon as possible to instruct the various trade associations to assist at any time to avoid misunderstandings. In view of this, I hope that your association will investigate and inform you to assist with the inspection.</p>
<p>The Clothing Trade Association notified its members yesterday, stating: For the purpose of notification, according to reports from the committee members in various districts of the industry who are inspecting Japanese goods, the procedures for inspecting and sealing Japanese goods are generally complete, which is commendable. What is worrying is that colleagues in our industry may inadvertently purchase Japanese goods that falsely claim to be domestic products or fabricate foreign trademarks. Such situations may be unavoidable. I would like to solemnly notify you again that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association will have to re-inspect the industry in the near future. If our industry is negligent and mistakenly purchases Japanese goods, causing them to be discovered, not only will the reputation of the association be affected, but also the sincerity of the industry's patriotism at this time may not be forgiven by others. Do not neglect this matter.</p>
<h3>Anhui People Request Investigation of Chen Tiaoyuan</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Anhui people telegram to the Fourth Plenary Session: To the Presidium of the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing and to all delegates, Chen Tiaoyuan, Chairman of Anhui Province, is corrupt and disorderly. The Control Yuan has thoroughly investigated and impeached him. Recently, he openly established a special opium tax office and appointed commissioners to collect taxes. This year, there was a major disaster, and the chairman's office delayed disaster relief. Instead, they used the prohibition of rice exports as a pretext to collect taxes and relax the ban, causing the people of Anhui to fear starvation. The troops under his command are undisciplined, extorting money from the people everywhere. In recent years, he has claimed to be eliminating the bandits, but in fact, he has supplied large quantities of weapons and ammunition to the Red Bandits, allowing them to occupy and grow in the six counties of Yinghuo. Chen's heavy troops and the Red Bandits have divided the territory and ruled separately, deceiving the central government, which is particularly harmful to the Party and the country.

<h3>A Young Girl's Story of Losing Her Virginity</h3>
<p>Feng Qiaoyun Narrowly Escaped</p>
<p>Jia Xiufang Was Seducted and Raped</p>
<p>Wang Guozhen Was Extremely Bold</p>
<p>Social Morality Is Worrying</p>
<p>Feng Ziqin, a 56-year-old man from Hubei, lives at No. 86, Jinjiafang, South City. He has a daughter named Qiaoyun, who is only 15 years old. She is very beautiful and used to study at the Shihua Girls' School in Taosha Market, South City. The other day, she had a quarrel with her family over trivial matters and suddenly had suicidal thoughts, planning to throw herself into the Huangpu River at the Bund. That night, she secretly told her classmate Jia Xiufang, a Nanjing native living at No. 48, Fuxing Lane, Zhangjia Lane, South City. Xiufang is 17 years old and also beautiful. The two went out together. They were talking along the way when suddenly three people came up from behind and started flirting with them. The two were seduced and invited to play at the Great World amusement park. They didn't leave until late at night, and then the three men lured the two women to a small hotel on the Fourth Road, intending to rape them. However, the numbers were three men and two women, so there was one man left over. The remaining man expressed his dissatisfaction, and the problem of one person affected the whole situation. The three men then decided to automatically sacrifice all of them, ordered the two women to stay in one room, and the three men left together, promising to return at 12:00 noon the next day. But on the day before yesterday, near noon, the three men did not return. The two women had no choice,</p>
<p>Being in a Dilemma, a handsome young man walked out of the room next door and offered his help in every way. After a few words, he invited them to visit the Great World again. The two women did not refuse and went with him. In the evening, they opened another inn, intending to kill two birds with one stone. Qiaoyun refused because she was too young, and as a result,</p>
<p>Slept with Xiufang for a Night, and a good virgin girl turned into an unmarried woman after being trampled on this night. Yesterday morning, the three went out together and took a tram. Qiaoyun couldn't get on the tram because the passengers were crowded. The young man and Xiufang got off at Avenue Edward VII and changed to a rickshaw to go to the Bund. But along the way, Xiufang suddenly met a relative. Xiufang took the opportunity to call out, and the young man stopped the car. When he saw Xiufang's relative, not only was he not afraid, but he even boasted that if it wasn't for him stopping her,</p>
<p>She Would Have Left Shanghai. Xiufang's relatives heard this and invited him to go to Jia's house together. The young man readily agreed. When they arrived at Jia's house, Xiufang's father was out, and only her mother was at home. Her mother was suspicious and questioned her daughter. Xiufang then</p>
<p>Told the Truth. Her mother was furious and called the police to take the young man to the First District and Second Sub-station. After Chief Yi interrogated him carefully, the young man confessed his name was Wang Guozhen, 26 years old, from Wuxian. He used to run a grocery store in Japan and recently returned from Japan. He admitted to raping Xiufang. Chief Yi obtained the confession and immediately prepared a document to report to the Judicial Section for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Heinous Act of Kidnappers: Nine People Killed</h3>
<p>Hankou Kidnappers Confessed</p>
<p>Bodies Buried on Yaozhu Road</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, nine bodies of people killed by kidnappers were found in the courtyards of houses No. 33 and 37, Aitang Village, Yaozhu Road, French Concession. It was heard that a large number of kidnappers had been arrested in Hankou and confessed that they had killed many hostages because their families did not prepare the ransom money.

Hankou immediately sent a telegram to the French police station requesting an on-site investigation to confirm whether it was true. The day before yesterday, detectives were sent to investigate and found the bodies one by one in the two houses, with five bodies buried in No. 37 and four bodies buried in No. 33.

<h3>Confiscation of Poisonous Whiskey</h3>
<p>May Lead to the Seizure of Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the Water Patrol Police seized two criminals selling poisonous whiskey in the Huangpu River yesterday (21st) and have notified the Public Concession Police to assist in investigating the smuggling organization. The local police authorities, aware of the prevalence of poisonous whiskey in the market recently, have been secretly investigating this smuggling group for two years. It is expected that after obtaining the confessions of the two criminals, they will be able to make a significant breakthrough. When the Water Patrol Police Chief Wei Bai seized the two criminals yesterday, they were transporting whiskey between various warships and merchant ships. According to their confessions, they have been engaged in smuggling for many months and have also used counterfeit money to deceive sailors. The police have been investigating the frequent receipt of counterfeit money by foreign sailors and hope that these two people may help to destroy a major counterfeit money manufacturing organization. It is also heard that they are also peddling fake gold rings inlaid with gems, asking only one yuan per ring. The reason Wei Bai knew about the smuggling organization and engaged in investigation was that foreign warships had recently experienced infighting among sailors, and the cause of the quarrel was found to be due to the sailors drinking a type of counterfeit whiskey. The genuine whiskey costs between seven and nine yuan per quart on the market, while the counterfeit whiskey sells for only two yuan. After chemical testing by chemists, it was found to contain a large amount of toxic substances, and drinking too much could be fatal. Wei Bai and No. 6 Water Patrol Wang Haiqi (transliteration) seized this type of poisonous whiskey and counterfeit money and rings on the spot. According to their confessions, the wine was purchased from a certain distillery in the Tilanqiao District, at a price of only five corners per quart, and various famous trademarks were affixed to the bottles.</p>
<h3>Xu Zhimo's Coffin Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Literary Association Held Memorial Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The coffin of Mr. Xu Zhimo, who tragically died in the China National Aviation Corporation's Jinan aircraft accident, has been transported from Jinan to Shanghai. It did not stop in Beijing, so the relatives and friends of Mr. Xu who were scheduled to go to Beijing yesterday also stayed in Shanghai. According to the Xu family, the coffin is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 23rd and will be buried at the International Funeral Parlor. However, Ms. Lu Xiaoman, Mr. Xu's wife, has fallen ill from grief and sorrow after hearing the tragic news of Mr. Xu's death in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Literary Association held a regular meeting at the Atlantic Restaurant yesterday (the 22nd) at noon. Members and guests present included Ye Yuhu, Zhang Xingyan, Song Chunfang, Cheng Yansheng, Zeng Xubai, Luo Longji, Meng Shouchun, Zhao Jingshen, Shen Xuan, Zeng Jinke, Wang Hanzhang, Chen Zhiqun, Wu Hanfang, Ge Gongzhen, and others, as well as Ying Dehui, Wang Youjia, and others.

At the end, Mr. Ge Gongzhen reported on the association's affairs, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Lacquer Shufen's Posthumous Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Lacquer's Wife Has No Formal Power of Attorney</p>
<p>Liu Zemin's Lawsuit Not Accepted</p>
<p>Lacquer Shufen of Sichuan, during his lifetime, authored a book titled "China Under Economic Aggression." His wife, Lacquer Ling, handed over the manuscript to Guanghua Bookstore for publication and signed a contract, specifying that the author's seal must be affixed before it could be sold after printing. It has now been published in eight editions, all without dispute. Recently, Liu Zemin, who was in charge of keeping Lacquer Ling's seal, discovered evidence of counterfeiting. Therefore, in the name of Lacquer Ling, he filed a criminal self-lawsuit against Guanghua Bookstore, accusing the bookstore of counterfeiting the seal. During the initial hearing, Liu Zemin did not appear in court and instructed his brother, Liu Zhimin, to impersonate him, hoping to deceive the court. However, the defendant stated that Liu Zhimin was not Zemin, so the case was adjourned. On the previous day, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court continued the hearing, and Liu Zemin personally appeared in court. The defendant's lawyer, Qiu Fenling, requested that Liu's qualifications be examined first. Liu then presented Lacquer Ling's power of attorney, which Judge Feng observed was issued last year, while the case was recently filed, so the facts did not match. Furthermore, the handwriting of Lacquer Ling's signature did not match the handwriting on the envelope. After questioning Liu, Lawyer Qiu stated that the defendant was a reputable bookstore and would not engage in such improper behavior. It was likely that someone else had privately reprinted the book, but the plaintiff had mistakenly accused the defendant, which was regrettable. The defendant was currently investigating the pirates and would pursue them legally. However, since Liu had no power to represent, the case should be dismissed. Judge Feng then ruled that the case was not accepted.</p>
<h3>Leakage of Rubber Overshoe Manufacturing Method</h3>
<p>Xue Fuxiang's Appeal Case Ruling</p>
<p>Wu Zhesheng, manager of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Overshoe Factory on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, previously hired lawyer Lin Jieqing to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing employee Xue Fuxiang of colluding with Zhang Chushan (Shuzi) and Tang Zhongxiu to leak the secret manufacturing method of overshoes to the Jiangnan Rubber Factory, violating Article 335 of the Criminal Law, and requesting investigation and compensation for damages in a civil lawsuit. It was found to be true, and Xue was sentenced to two months of imprisonment and a fine of four hundred yuan for leaking secrets and breach of trust. Zhang and Tang were each fined three hundred yuan. Xue and others, dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, hired a lawyer to present reasons and submit a petition to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, requesting an appeal. After repeated inquiries by Guo Dezhang, the head of the Criminal Division, along with Judges Zhang and Li, the debate was declared closed, and the verdict was pending. Yesterday, the date of the verdict arrived. At 10:00 a.m., Chief Judge Guo, along with Judges Zhang and Li, opened the Second Criminal Court and ordered the appellants to be brought to court and announced the verdict. The original verdict was revoked except for the confiscation of a portion. Xue Fuxiang, for the purpose of obtaining illegal benefits for himself and a third party while handling affairs for others, engaged in acts that violated his duties, causing damage to the principal's property, and was sentenced to two months of imprisonment and a fine of one hundred yuan. Zhang Chushan and Tang Zhongxiu incited and assisted others to engage in acts that violated their duties, causing damage to the principal's property, and were each sentenced to forty days of detention and a fine of sixty yuan. If the fines cannot be paid through compulsory execution, two yuan will be converted into one day of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized will be used to offset the imprisonment or detention for two days for one day, or one day for two yuan of the fine.</p>
<h3>Pitiful Fruit Vendor Commits Suicide</h3>

He immediately escorted him to the police station along with the patrol police. After a detailed interrogation by the police chief, the Russian man claimed that when he walked to the entrance of No. 655, the robber suddenly pulled out a pistol, blocked his path, and attempted to rob him. He took advantage of the robber's unpreparedness and struck the robber's gun-wielding hand, knocking the gun to the ground and subduing him. The arrested robber, Fan Xuegong, from Jiangbei, completely denied holding a gun and attempting to rob, saying that the Russian man was framing him. At the time, many people were gathered at the entrance of No. 655, shouting loudly. Before long, the crowd dispersed, and a pistol was left on the ground. The Russian man arrested him without asking any questions. The police chief, based on the confession, ordered him to be detained and sent to the court for investigation because the case involved armed robbery.</p>

<p>Chen Daying, a sixteen-year-old apprentice from Haiyan at Wanshun Soy Sauce Garden, No. 857-858 Zhoujiazui Road, poured kerosene on newspapers and lit them, placing them under the ledger cabinet, because he harbored resentment after the shop owner, Feng Fusong, discovered that he had previously stolen ten silver dollars and wanted to fire him.</p>
<p>The fire was discovered by his companion, Yang Danian, who urgently called out to his companions to put it out. Fortunately, no disaster occurred. The apprentice was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and sentencing.

<h3>Ministry of Industry Plans to Build Aquatic Products Exhibition Hall</h3>
<p>Collecting Local Aquatic Products Specimens,</p>
<p>and Models and Charts of Fishing Vessels and Gear</p>
<p>The city council discussed the Ministry of Industry's plan to build aquatic products exhibition halls and sent letters to various trade associations, such as the fresh fish market, soliciting various specimens, models, and charts. The letter stated that on the 20th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau forwarded an order from the Ministry of Industry stating that China has vast rivers and seas, and numerous lakes and marshes, and aquatic products are abundant. However, due to improper fishing and manufacturing methods, imported goods have taken advantage of the situation, and money flows out of the country, amounting to tens of millions of yuan each year. If measures are not taken to improve the situation, it will become even worse. The Ministry of Industry, in view of this, plans to collect special aquatic product specimens and models and charts of fishing vessels and gear from various regions for detailed review and special display for reference. Five measures for collecting aquatic product specimens and models of fishing vessels and gear have been formulated. The Bureau is instructed to comply with and collect the items separately, and submit them to the Ministry by February of the 21st year of the Republic for display. The original document is enclosed for reference. The Bureau is instructed to comply with and submit the items to the Bureau for review and transfer as soon as possible. The measures for collecting aquatic product specimens and models of fishing vessels and gear are as follows: (1) Aquatic product specimens are divided into two categories: biological and model. A. Biological category: divided into original organisms and manufactured products. 1. Original organisms: various aquatic animals and plants. 2. Manufactured products: salted, dried, canned, medicines, fertilizers, oil wax, salt glue, agar, leather, etc. B. Model category: 1. Fishing vessels, steamships, oil engine ships, wooden boats. 2. Fishing gear, nets, hooks, diving equipment, harpoons, etc. (2) The aquatic product specimens collected should be the most important local products with complete body shapes. The manufactured products should be those with excellent manufacturing methods and wide sales channels. The models should be those that are popular locally and conducive to fishing. However, the original organisms must be immersed in medicine and bottled or skinned. (3) The numbers, names, origins, production values, manufacturing methods, uses, sales channels, names of producers, and names and dates of collection of all aquatic product specimens and models must be recorded separately. (4) If aquatic products or vessel equipment cannot be made into specimens or models, the original object must be drawn and sent to the Ministry. (5) For the transportation of specimens, if they are immersed in medicine, various items can be mixed in broken bottles in their oil tanks and sent to the Ministry for repackaging in glass bottles. The rest should also be sealed in wooden boxes and sent to the post office.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Explains the British Chamber of Commerce's Doubts About the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Foreign Merchants May Not Engage in the Weights and Measures Industry</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, based on the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's report that the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce had requested an explanation of various doubts about the implementation measures of the new system of weights and measures, has clearly instructed the Social Affairs Bureau item by item with Industry Letter No. 2784. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>The British Chamber of Commerce's Points of Request for Explanation (1) Under the weights and measures system, can foreign merchants (A) import weights and measures instruments, (B) sell weights and measures instruments, (C) manufacture weights and measures instruments in China? If permitted, what are the special taxation regulations? (2) What kind of symbol is legal for the identification of scales? (A) If it is the symbol of the new standard system, can other foreign standard symbols also be added? (B) Are measuring instruments with only foreign symbols allowed to be used? (3) For new purchases of weights and measures items stored by Chinese and foreign import merchants, if the inventory is not allowed to be sold, the losses suffered by the merchants will be enormous. In this situation, is it permissible? (A) Can inventory with symbols such as pounds, kilograms, and jins be sold if a conversion table is attached? (B) Can inventory with symbols such as pounds and jins be sold if a conversion table is attached? (4) For weights and measures instruments already in use in shops and factories, most of which are currently marked with foreign symbols and jins, if the weights and measures instruments are changed to the newly ordered symbols, it will not only be a huge project but also take a lot of time. In this situation, if the old system of weights and measures instruments is attached with a conversion table and continues to be used, is it allowed to be used during this transition period of about three to five years? The various weights and measures instruments mentioned above refer to weighing platforms, scales, measuring machines, exposed pointer machines (day and night instruments), and spring scales. We would be very grateful if you could provide answers to the above questions so that we can plan the implementation methods. Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce Acting Secretary, Gambton.</p>
<p>Original Report of the Social Affairs Bureau Regarding the report of the British Chamber of Commerce's letter requesting an explanation of various doubts about the implementation measures of the weights and measures system, the Bureau previously reported to your Ministry and received instructions in Industry Letter No. 2068 stating that all items in the report have been noted. The items for which the Chamber of Commerce requested explanation concern the law and should be translated into Chinese and submitted. They cannot be used directly in English. Please inform them to comply with this order. After complying with the order, they have now translated it into Chinese and submitted it. We hereby copy the original document and submit it for your review. Furthermore, various questions about the regulations for standardizing weights and measures have been reported and requested for explanation, but no instructions have been given so far. The city's promotion of the new weights and measures system in the special zone is being actively carried out. Various questions about the regulations should be explained and followed. We request that your Ministry promptly review and instruct us on the matter so that we can instruct us to comply separately, which would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Instructions from the Ministry of Industry The report and copies have been noted. Since the Weights and Measures Law and the Regulations on the Operation of Weights and Measures Instruments do not have any provisions that foreigners can engage in the weights and measures business, the permission for weights and measures business is limited to Chinese citizens. All provincial and municipal governments have been notified to check this matter. The first paragraph of the original report, items A, B, and C, are naturally not approved. The marks mentioned in the second paragraph, items A and B, do not comply with Articles 4 and 6 of the Weights and Measures Law and Article 10 of the Implementation Rules and cannot be considered legal. For various weights and measures inventories in the third paragraph, a calculation table is attached. If they are Chinese merchants, they may be temporarily sold after a temporary inspection by the local competent authority in accordance with Article 53 of the Implementation Rules of the Weights and Measures Law. However, they must stop selling at the expiration of the deadline for prohibiting the sale of old instruments as stipulated in the unified procedures of various provinces and cities. The instruments listed in the fourth paragraph, with a conversion table attached and subject to periodic or temporary inspection by the competent authority, may be used temporarily, but may not be used again after the provinces and cities complete the standardization deadline. The instruments must be modified and sent to the inspection agency for legal inspection and affixed with a legal seal before they can be used. Please inform us immediately and store the copies. This order,</p>

<p>Joint Warning The Shanghai Publishing Industry Union and the branch offices of Commercial Press, Zhonghua Bookstore, World Book Company, and Minzhi Bookstore jointly sent a letter to Shen Junsheng, the manager of Datong Bookstore, stating that the workers of your bookstore had previously proposed conditions to maintain their minimum living standards in order to improve their treatment. However, for several months, you have been perfunctory and refused, disregarding the workers' lives and using various cruel methods to force the leaders of the workers to leave the factory, carrying out the destruction of the labor movement. The workers of your bookstore were forced to strike. Therefore, the current labor unrest was caused by your bookstore. Since the strike began six days ago, not only has your bookstore not shown any sincerity in resolving the conditions, but it has also dared to use money and power to arrest workers, fabricate facts, post notices, publish them in various newspapers, confuse the public, and undermine the unity of the workers. Your methods are extremely cruel. This office is in a position of shared interests and vows to lead 6,000 workers to provide effective assistance. We hope that you will immediately send responsible representatives to negotiate the conditions in good faith and not delay any longer. This is a special letter of warning. Sincerely, to Mr. Shen Junsheng, Manager of Datong Bookstore.</p>
<p>Union Declaration The City Publishing Industry Union's declaration on the strike of Datong Bookstore workers states that all members of the Datong Bookstore affiliated with this union joined the union in August of this year. At that time, it was planned to formally establish the Datong Bookstore Office of the Publishing Industry Union at the same time. However, at the request of the capital, the labor side took into account the company's prospects for raising capital, and the union office was temporarily postponed in name, but in practice, they could negotiate and improve treatment conditions in advance. A letter was sent to the Publishing Industry Union, agreeing to start negotiations on the afternoon of October 19. At that time, the capital side sent Shen Junsheng, Luo Wuyu, Xu Zhiren, Ling Guiqing, Guo Hongfei, and others as representatives, and the union sent Yang Youren, Wang Yongliang, Zhou Zhicheng, Hou Dachun, and others as representatives. The office sent Yang Mingqiu, Yu Xuekang, Shi Xueqing, and others as representatives to attend the negotiation. The first article, mutual concessions between the two parties, was quite close, and it was agreed that the company should recognize the Shanghai Municipal Publishing Industry Union as having the right to represent</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>all members of the Datong Office and subsidize the office's operating expenses by 60 yuan per month. Because it was late, it was agreed to continue the negotiations the next day. Unexpectedly, on the second day, the capital side suddenly changed its mind and suddenly announced that it would no longer negotiate, disregarding its promise and behaving quite stubbornly. The members of the office were very angry when they heard about it. That night, they unanimously stopped working at night, hoping to prompt the capital side to realize its mistake. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau took the initiative to mediate, ordering the labor side to resume night work immediately and ordering the capital side to continue negotiating the conditions immediately. Unexpectedly, after the labor side resumed night work, the capital side violated the government order and refused. Although the office repeatedly requested it, the manager of the bureau, Shen Junsheng, always made excuses and shirked his responsibility. The labor side learned that this was Shen's cunning attitude, so they sent a letter to the board of directors, asking them to send another responsible representative. The letter was shelved by Shen. On November 14, they sent a second letter to the board of directors, limiting the reply to 24 hours. When the deadline expired, there was still no response. As a result, all members could no longer bear it and went on strike. Therefore, the responsibility for this labor unrest should be completely attributed to the company. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau favored one side over the other, repeatedly ordering the labor side to resume work, and even limited the date for resumption of work. If they did not resume work by the third day (November 21), they would be considered to have voluntarily resigned, and the company would be allowed to recruit new workers. This is very regrettable. This union holds the purpose of settling matters peacefully, so on the afternoon of the 20th of this month, it sent Wang Yongliang, Chen Xuanren, Yang Youren, Ni Xiaoxian, and Chen Yuesheng to the bureau to meet Shen Junsheng to discuss concessions. At that time, Mr. Guo Hongfei from the general office contacted him and telegraphed Mr. Shen, who said that he would come to the factory immediately. Unexpectedly, Mr. Shen did not arrive until 5:30 p.m. It was agreed to change the meeting to 10:00 a.m. on the 21st, but he did not come at that time either. It can be seen that the capital side's attitude is strong and confident. In this regard, this union can only maintain the spirit of revolution, rectify the battle line, and fight to the end with the stubborn capital side of the bureau. This declaration, November 22.</p>

Western medicine is based on science, while traditional Chinese medicine is also based on science, but it is even more profound than Western medicine. Moreover, the miraculous effects of its medicines are unmatched by Western medicine. However, it is difficult to achieve results with traditional Chinese medicine without traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine must work together," and so on. The gathering concluded with joy at 9:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Reader's Letter</h3>
<p>How to Most Effectively Resist Japanese Goods In this unprecedented national humiliation, as long as one is not insane, I believe no one would buy Japanese goods. Resisting Japanese goods is almost unanimously agreed upon nationwide. However, why can't Japanese goods be completely eliminated from the Chinese market? I think there are two reasons: (1) Buyers do not know that what they are buying are Japanese goods. The market is full of foreign goods, and Japanese goods have a wide variety of types and vague labels. People without discerning eyes naturally do not know what to do. Therefore, Japanese goods should be classified and investigated. I think the current Japanese goods can be divided into the following categories: (1) Silk and cloth; (2) Foreign general merchandise and cosmetics; (3) Cotton yarn; (4) Western medicines and chemicals; (5) Porcelain; (6) Firewood and fuel; (7) Dried goods and salted fish; (8) Paper, stationery, and toys; (9) Clocks and watches; (10) Automotive hardware and electrical materials; (11) Tonics; (12) Shoes and socks. The above categories of goods should be investigated by genuine merchants, item by item. And investigate various Japanese trademarks, such as the Yuan Gong Ni and Hunter Goose trademark for Japanese silk and cloth. After investigating each item, a list of Japanese goods should be published, and each store must have this list of Japanese goods posted so that buyers have a standard. (2) Not knowing the stakes of buying Japanese goods. Naturally, those who are informed understand the stakes of buying Japanese goods, but China is not only a poor country but also a culturally backward country. Therefore, many villagers, far away in remote rural areas, simply do not know what Japan is. Naturally, they do not know the relationship between resisting Japanese goods and the country. They only know that cheap and high-quality goods are bought for use. Therefore, we should expand publicity and go to the countryside to publicize it, so that they will not use Japanese goods. This is not only effective in resisting Japanese goods but also enables the national people to recognize the national crisis and rise up to save the country as an urgent matter. We know that farmers in the countryside have natural and genuine hearts. We can use moving words to publicize and will surely arouse their sympathy. Once the Chinese people can rise up to defend the country themselves, what does Japan really count for? If those who buy Japanese goods disappear, I think the cunning of treacherous merchants will also be helpless. As for the fundamental words, we naturally have to promote industry and improve domestic goods.</p>

<h3>Openness (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuilin</p>
<p>A Courtesan's Reply</p>
<p>Logically, since you desire me so much, and I genuinely need you, I shouldn't have revealed so many facts and thoughts that compromise my dignity to you. Tearing away the embroidered curtain you've erected in your heart for me, exposing my plain, even somewhat ugly, inner self, risks extinguishing the flames of your ardor.</p>
<p>Yet, I'm willing to risk shattering my soul to reach the paradise of happiness I desire. In the brief time we've known each other, I've longed to capture you as my temporal lover. But at every crucial moment, you're too solemn, diminishing my courage to advance. You must understand, society deems it shameful for a woman to express admiration for a man first. While this only prevents women from openly declaring their feelings, if she truly admires a man, she'll cleverly and keenly convey her sentiments. She can turn a stubborn, proud man into a gentle, humble servant at her feet. To put it strongly, she can turn a man of steel into pliable softness, playing with him like a fishing line.</p>
<p>I believe a man manipulated by such a woman is happy. Likewise, a woman who makes a man love her with such cunning is also happy. I believe you and I have reached this stage. Several times, at critical junctures, you still slipped away. I was deeply disappointed, feeling my charm couldn't move you. Now I realize it was all due to inexperienced timidity, forcing me to retreat.</p>
<p>I mistook your timidity for disdain, so when I saw you later, I tried to seduce your soul, both by dressing in what I thought was my most natural and alluring attire, and by ambiguously rejecting your advances, as if to avenge you for squandering opportunities to capture me, leading to this amusing drama.</p>
<p>Before this letter, you hadn't come to see me for fifteen consecutive days. You can imagine how guilty I felt for causing you such pain, for driving you away. I grieved as if I'd lost my most precious treasure. Every knock made my heart leap, thinking it was you. But it was always some vulgar person.</p>
<p>Before your letter arrived, I'd resolved to seize you the moment you returned, no matter how solemn you were. I decided to openly plead with you, even if you publicly humiliated me, mocked me, or abused me. I was determined to capture you. Little did I know that those fifteen days weren't a departure, but a brewing of your final assault. Even if you hadn't written, I would have sought you out. I kept procrastinating, thinking you'd come today, only to be disappointed.</p>
<p>I confess, no man has ever made me miss him so desperately. I've never confessed my thoughts so frankly and sincerely to any man. Only to you now. Initially, I only wanted to capture you as my temporal lover. Now, that's not enough. Now, I want you as my lifelong lover. That's why I'm willing to reveal my selfish, self-serving, and disreputable past. If you agree to be my lifelong lover, you'll eventually learn all this. Rather than deceiving you now, and planting seeds of unhappiness that could explode like bombs in the future, I'd rather tell you everything, naked and unadorned. Perhaps you can forgive everything. If you can't forgive me, even if I deceive you now, the truth will eventually surface and cause a rupture.</p>
<p>Yinjun, don't laugh at me. I feel like a suddenly wealthy pauper. When I wasn't wealthy, I craved wealth. Now that I am, I'm burdened by worries. When you were gone for those fifteen days, I desperately missed you. Now that I've heard from you, I'm afraid. Will my openness cool your heart? If you disappear forever, even if I seek you out, you'll avoid me, showing me your stern rejection. That would at least put my mind at ease. However, having showered me with affection for so many days, only to receive nothing in return seems unfair. Furthermore, I've missed many opportunities to gain a very lovable man, and may never enjoy your even more moving emotions. Time may eventually fade the memory. But now that you're ardently approaching me, my excessive enthusiasm might repel you. If I'd simply replied haughtily, allowing you to come to my side whenever you please, you'd be as delighted as if receiving a royal decree, and you'd come to me quickly, with shy eagerness. Even if I couldn't gain you permanently, I'd at least enjoy considerable satisfaction in the short term. If I've truly repelled you, I don't know how much I'll regret it.</p>
<p>But, Yinjun, I refuse to deceive you selfishly. I love you too much. If a deep union is possible, let's unite. If not, though I'm an unfortunate person, I refuse to tarnish another good soul.</p>
<p>People always suspect intentions, especially regarding a woman's desires. People are even more suspicious of someone in my position. And my actions, though secret, are practically public knowledge. Once you're with me, you'll be subjected to cold ridicule. You'll eventually learn everything, and then how much will you suffer? If you grant my request, I'll hire you, or give you some other title, so you can live near me. We'll live as lovers, though others may only envy you. If we live together, as long as you can forgive me, I'm willing to tell you everything about my past.</p>
<p>Yinjun, my thoughts are chaotic. I can't consider your feelings fully. Please come to my side as soon as you receive this letter. Perhaps there are still things I don't understand. Let's have a deep, lengthy talk and decide how to proceed. Even if it's just a purely platonic conversation.</p>
<p>Man Shang.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>— Huanming</p>
<p>Since the military training department issued a notice similar in style to the headquarters, the number of people exercising in military training classes has suddenly increased. Every morning at 6:20 AM, there is also a morning exercise. Missing four morning exercises results in a major demerit, the same as missing four hours of military training.</p>
<p>Harsh winter has already crept into the southern states. In the early morning, who has the courage to resist the invading cold, except for those lying in warm quilts? The instructor blows the assembly whistle sharply along the dormitory, carried by the cold wind into the tightly closed windows. The scattered chimes of the bell ring as if in a dream.</p>
<p>Everyone in the room pushes aside their blankets and jumps out of bed. Teeth chatter, and mouths hiss, sucking in the cold air. Throwing on clothes, they still want to shrink back into the warmth of the quilt. The assembly whistle blows even more sharply. Everyone has no choice but to get dressed, muster their courage, and rush to the drill ground.</p>
<p>On the drill ground, people tighten their whole bodies, jumping back and forth, as if mad. Some even chase and hit each other to keep warm.</p>
<p>After the morning exercise, the sun has already leapt out from the east, and the clouds glow with bright colors. The natural beauty of a cold winter morning is not very close to us. While everyone brushes their teeth, they can't help but raise their heads and look up at the sky.</p>
<p>Military training is almost every afternoon. Because the drill ground in the school is too small, it is necessary to borrow nearby open spaces as training grounds. After finishing the afternoon's classes, everyone is ready to go. The team marches towards the school gate with neat steps. The ground rustles, rustles, rustles.</p>
<p>That open space for training is as vast as if it has no edge. When the large group enters the drill ground, the cold wind blows, and they have no choice but to grit their teeth to resist the cold. After a quick run, the whole body is much warmer. Then we begin our drills. The platoon leader (all our classmates) shouts out commands in a high-pitched voice. They shout until their throats are hoarse, with great effort, and they must also correct everyone's posture without any politeness.</p>
<p>Time passes in this solemn and mechanical atmosphere. The sky has gradually darkened. On the vast drill ground, only countless black shadows can be seen moving non-stop, as if unaware that it is dark.</p>
<p>The street lights are already on. The surroundings are even quieter. Only the sharp sound of commands and the neat sound of footsteps can be heard.</p>
<p>The assembly whistle sounds. Each platoon immediately returns to its team, aligns the ranks, and begins the journey back to school.</p>
<p>There are very few pedestrians on the street. A few street lights shine sparsely. The sound of footsteps is even more steady and powerful, as if fighting against the darkness.</p>
<p>The team reaches the school when you can't see your fingers. Relying on the lights in the dormitory shining on the drill ground, you can barely recognize it.</p>
<p>Once the team is dismissed, the dormitory suddenly becomes noisy.</p>
<p>(Haha, Old Wang, you are too fierce as platoon leader!)</p>
<p>(The voice is not bad, like a hoarse old hen.) Everyone couldn't help but burst into laughter after hearing this.</p>
<p>Under the electric lights, Platoon Leader Wang is pinned on the bed by Little Zhang and spanked. Platoon Leader Wang cries for mercy. This is his own fault because he swiped a few biscuits from Little Zhang. Old Wang is desperate and quickly shouts (Attention!), but it has no effect. Soon, Little Zhang lets go with a smile.</p>
<p>The dinner bell rings. Soon, the clanging of chopsticks and bowls, and thunderous laughter, can be heard in the dining hall.</p>
<h3>Return from Fundraising</h3>
<p>— Huangfu Jun</p>
<p>This time, the various universities in the city, in order to aid General Ma, who commands the isolated army defending against the enemy, suspended classes for two days, the 19th and 20th, to go out and raise funds. I also participated. Before setting off, I was full of confidence that this time's results would be considerable, because this is the real protection of our territory. All Chinese citizens should be scrambling to volunteer and donate. But what is the reality? Alas, I want to cry but have no tears, I am extremely sad. Today, let me use the pages of this publication to write down a few words that fellow countrymen, our same race, used to reply to me when I was fundraising:</p>
<p>At the intersection of Gordon Road, I encountered a gentleman wearing a British hat and a wadana robe. I immediately stepped forward and said "Excuse me," and talked to him about the reasons for our fundraising, requesting him to donate whatever he was willing to. That gentleman said with an annoying expression (There is no such rule. I don't understand what Heilongjiang Ma Zhanshan is.) At that time, although I wanted to use my boiling blood and sincere feelings to persuade that gentleman—not to persuade him to donate money, but to persuade him to change his mind and put national affairs first—he had already run away as if flying. I don't know what he means by the two words "(rule)".</p>
<p>At the intersection of North Zhejiang Road, we were raising money from a young lady when a compatriot who looked like a worker came over and asked me (Are you raising funds for General Ma?) I said (Yes.) He immediately put three white silver dollars, one by one, into my bamboo tube. I looked at his tattered clothes and sincere attitude, and couldn't help but be moved to tears. After I asked him, I learned that he was a miscellaneous worker in the Old Zhabei Bridge vegetable market.</p>
<p>We raised funds in the Great World area for about an hour, preparing to take the No. 5 tram to the North Station. Unexpectedly, the ticket seller in the first-class seat (our fellow Chinese citizen) said to me, (This is a French tram and fundraising is not allowed.) I immediately replied, (I have money to buy a ticket.) That owner, a citizen of great China, replied, (If you have money, please go to the government office and buy a ticket.) His cold facial expression really made my blood boil. I no longer had the courage to reason with him.</p>
<p>This time I set off from Fanhangdu, passing through Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Hart Road, Avenue Edward VII, and arriving at the Great World. In the end, I raised a total of three silver dollars, seventy-odd cents in small silver coins, and some copper coins. When I returned to school in the evening, I saw the news that the Anti-Japanese Association's Ma Department had been completely wiped out due to lack of food and external support, I couldn't help but cry bitterly. Alas, China, my beloved China!</p>

<p>Zhonghe Trouser Rack Factory announces that the factory is established by Mr. Chen Jianhan, manufacturing Beautiful Woman brand trouser racks, which are convenient tools for tidying up Western suits and Zhongshan suits trousers. After using the trouser rack, there is no need for ironing, and the trouser crease will naturally be straight and neat. Simple to use and reasonably priced, they are very popular among the general public. During this time of national crisis, in order to encourage compatriots to change to short clothing and invigorate the national spirit, the factory has specially set up mail-order and delivery departments. Those who wish to purchase trouser racks can request discount coupons from the factory. Furthermore, for the convenience of out-of-town patrons, the factory invites a manager to establish a simplified chapter. Send a letter to request it with postage attached. The distribution office is located at No. 5 Fengle Lane, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Xiaodongmen Lehua Sock Factory announces that since its opening, the factory's business has been fairly prosperous. The Green Tree brand silk thread woolen socks sold are extremely durable and wear-resistant, and the selling price is especially low. Therefore, buyers flock to the factory, and the threshold is worn through. As a result, the original store is not enough for use. Now, after repeated planning by the factory director, Mr. Geng Desen, and Mr. Mei, they have been urging the workers to actively renovate it, and the location is more than half a foot larger than the original. In the future, customers will visit, and there will probably not be as crowded a situation as before.</p>
<p>The Suisheng Rice Store in Qianjiatang, Southwest of Avenue Joffre, French Concession, announces that the store will officially open on the 26th of this month. It directly ships white japonica rice from Jiangsu and Changzhou, foreign fragrant rice and domestically produced high-quality white flour from various provinces. It also sells sweet potatoes, onions, and various miscellaneous grains, everything that should be available. I look forward to your patronage, and I will be exceptionally accommodating.</p>
<p>Baoxing Mineral Powder Factory announces that since our country has been occupied by the violent Japanese in the Northeast, all patriotic people are united against the enemy. The oath of the municipal chamber of commerce to never buy or sell Japanese goods is extremely thorough. The voice of resisting Japan and saving the country permeates the entire country. However, in fact, without the substitution of domestic raw materials, it is not enough to achieve the effect of permanent resistance. It is now known that the factory on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, has its own mining area in Jurong, Jiangsu, where it mines a lot of pencil lead, and the quality is high, even surpassing imported products. Therefore, the factory's Gem brand pencil powder has been quite reputable since it was sold. There are many certificates of proof and introduction from battery factories and carbon rod manufacturers. Recently, mining affairs have been actively underway, and business is also booming. Now, in order to facilitate the identification of excellent domestic goods, it is planned to make plates of various awards and certificates to publish in newspapers, to promote them and to prevent counterfeiting. The factory has been given a plaque with the four characters "Bao Zang Xing Yan" by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines, which can be called truly well-deserved.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>Dacheng Drama Society announces that the society has recently seen the increasingly serious issue of resisting Japan and saving the country. Yesterday, members You Jusun, Rong Ruichang, You Rongbo, Xu Jinchang, Lin Yonghua, etc., convened an emergency meeting to discuss the method of raising funds through theatrical performances. Tao Renqian, Lu Shouzhi, Shan Zongji, Rong Changnian, Shen Junsan, Shao Zhenbiao and many other members attended. Zhao Xianji, Yuan Zhizhong, Wang Baoqin, Ren Nongxuan, etc., gave speeches one after another. After discussion, it was agreed that since each member had already pre-donated to the national salvation fund in various industry groups, the fundraising procedure of the society was not as good as raising it through theatrical performances, in order to widely solicit donations. In addition to the social attendees recognizing and selling more than 2,400 yuan worth of drama coupons on the spot, they will continue to persuade them to recognize them, and designate You Jusun, Rong Ruichang, etc. to be responsible, to work hard and actively carry them out.</p>

<h3>Comparison of Japanese Army and Chinese Army (Continued)</h3>
<p>Ping</p>
<p>Since the violent Japanese occupied our Northeast, our military authorities, in order to avoid responsibility issues, advocated non-resistance, intending to subdue this ambitious and violent Japanese with world justice. The speakers knew early on that this was impossible. Now the period limited by the League of Nations for the withdrawal of troops is coming soon, and not only do the Japanese soldiers have no intention of withdrawing, but they are even further forcibly taking our customs duties and salt taxes, bundling them up and taking them to Japan. At the same time, they are also sending large numbers of troops to attack our Heilongjiang. News has come in for days that the Japanese soldiers have attacked our army. Our army, for the sake of self-defense, has also given them a head-on blow. The Japanese soldiers have failed in two attacks. This shows that the Chinese army is not incapable of defending the country. Our officers and soldiers are not without the ambition to love the country and resist the enemy. Our soldiers are not without the perseverance to kill the enemy. It is only because the orders of the superiors cannot be violated, that the great rivers and mountains are allowed to be ravaged by the Japanese, and that our divine Chinese descendants are left with this stain. It is extremely painful to speak of. The number of our country's army ranks first in the world, and military spending accounts for eight-tenths of the country's income. With so many armies being raised, foreign enemies invade and cannot be resisted. Hundreds of thousands of troops are conquered by a mere Japanese pirate. This is not only a shame in history, but also a laughing stock to the nations of the world. During the Ming Dynasty, when the Japanese pirates were a problem, Qi Jiguang rose up and killed the bandits, so that the Japanese pirates dared not invade again. Where is Qi Jiguang today? Allowing the Japanese pirates to run rampant so recklessly?</p>
<p>The Japanese army has only about twenty regular divisions, as mentioned in the previous article, while our country's army is at least seven or eight times that of the Japanese soldiers. How can it not be enough to resist Japan? With the hardworking and battle-resistant Chinese army, it is enough to defeat the arrogant and complacent Japanese pirates. The saying goes that an arrogant army will be defeated, and complacency will lead to failure. This is a common principle. In the past, in the Russo-Japanese War, Russia was stronger than Japan, but Russia was defeated in the end. Today, although China's power is extremely weak, it is precisely the time when things are at their worst and are about to recover. With the nationwide people's hatred and indignation, one can be equal to a hundred. Even if military weapons are inferior to others, however, war depends on the morale of the soldiers. If everyone has the heart to die, then what is there to fear from these island Japanese pirates? Moreover, the entire battle at the moment is based on the economy. The three islands of Japan rely entirely on trade with our country. Since the boycott, although it has only been a short period of two months, it has actually suffered a major blow. Japanese merchants in China will be fundamentally eliminated. If we persist, the country's domestic economy will also be shaken. And if our country fights with it, if it can support for more than three months, Japan's economy will also experience extreme panic. Today, the reporter met a certain crew member of the Japanese ship Luoyang Maru, who told me that this boycott is unprecedented. The ship returned to Shanghai from Hankou with 40 Japanese expatriates on board. Along the way, they wanted to buy food, but Chinese vendors all refused. One day, a Japanese person showed up with a dollar, wanting to buy a fried dough stick. The Japanese person thought that the Chinese coolies must be greedy for money. A thing that usually costs thirty or forty coins, giving him a one-dollar price, must be available for purchase. Who knew that the coolie refused to sell it and returned the one dollar thrown by the Japanese person. Forty Japanese expatriates came to Shanghai starving. Therefore, Nissin Company received the news and immediately suspended the Luoyang Maru and other ships. In this boycott by the people of the country, the lower the social class, the more determined the will. It can be seen that with the unity of the upper and lower classes, it is possible to control Japan's fate. Even the Japanese are chilled by it.</p>
<p>During the era of warlord rule in China, the national army was divided into three major factions: the Zhili faction, the Anhui faction, and the Fengtian army. The power of the Zhili army was the greatest. Since the Northern Expedition, the Zhili army has been defeated, the Anhui faction has also long disintegrated, and the Fengtian army has withdrawn from outside the Guan. The Sun army, which dominated the southeast, has also transformed and dissolved. Therefore, the revolution was successful. At that time, the military forces were the central national army, the Yan army of Shanxi, the Feng army of the Northwest, and the Fengtian army outside the Guan. The national army was divided into four major forces, while Sichuan occupied a single side, standing alone. Since Yan and Feng raised troops last year, the central government sent troops to suppress them. After a four-month battle, with the assistance of the Northeast, it succeeded. The forces of Yan and Feng disappeared, and the central government's increased military strength became greater. The Northeast also rose suddenly. Later, Guangdong and Guangxi united and formed a government. The military in Guangdong and Guangxi also actively expanded. Today, our country's army has become the three forces of the Central Army, the Northern Army (under the command of Feng Zhang), and the Guangdong-Guangxi Army. This is the comparison of the recent rise and fall of military power. Since the year of Jiazi, the number of soldiers who died in civil wars in our country has been at least more than one million. Such as the Battle of Jiugoumen, the Battle of Nankou, the Battle of Qilu, and the Battle of Jiangxi De'an during the Northern Expedition, the Sun army crossing the Yangtze River, the Battle of Longtan, and the Battle of Zhengzhou when Tang Shengzhi rebelled, and the Battle of Guide, the Battle of Lanfeng, the Battle of Jinan, and the various bandit-suppression campaigns this time when Yan and Feng raised troops. The armed comrades who died can truly be called blood flowing like a river, and corpses piled like mountains. If the soldiers who sacrificed in the civil war could be transferred to deal with foreign enemies, there would be none who would not drive the enemy to outside the country. Recently, in He Xiangning's letter to armed comrades, it is said that the blood of the national soldiers should be sprinkled on the Iranian people of the enemy country. Even if they die, there is glory. It is most shameful to sacrifice for the civil war. It is especially evident that the strength of the National Army is sufficient to defeat the Japanese pirates, as evidenced by the Black Army Ma Zhanshan's defeat of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The organization of our country's army used to be modeled on the Japanese army system. Each division was divided into two infantry brigades, each brigade had two infantry regiments, and each regiment had three battalions. Each battalion was divided into four companies, and each company had three platoons. Each platoon had forty-two men. Therefore, the number of people in a battalion, combined with soldiers, was five hundred and two. In addition, there was an added cavalry battalion, an artillery battalion, an engineering transport battalion each, a machine gun company, and a military band. This is the army organization promulgated by our country. What our country calls a division, Japan calls a division group. What our country calls a brigade, Japan calls a brigade group. What our country calls a regiment, Japan calls a regiment. What our country calls a battalion, Japan calls a large team. What our country calls a company, Japan calls a squadron. Therefore, the number of infantrymen in each division, according to the regulations, is six thousand and twenty-four. Adding cavalry, artillery, engineering transport, and machine guns, the total number of officers and soldiers is more than ten thousand. This is the fixed system of the army in our country. The position of division commander is always held by a lieutenant general or a major general. The brigade commander is a major general, the regimental commander is a colonel, the battalion commander is a lieutenant colonel, and the company commander is a captain. The division headquarters organization, below the division commander, is the chief of staff, adjutant general, quartermaster general, military medical officer, and secretary. The brigade headquarters has no staff. If it is a mixed brigade, then the position of brigade commander is larger than that of an ordinary infantry brigade. Those who hold it are mostly major generals, and the organization also has cavalry, artillery, engineering transport. It is found that the army in our country has always been called the five arms. The formation of a division or a mixed brigade is these five arms: infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering and transport. The reporter also joined the army around the beginning of the Republic and left the military career until the tenth year of the Republic. At that time, what was popular was the Japanese army exercise. The soldiers held their guns, all on their right shoulders. There were five movements in the basic training of holding a gun. Later, the Ministry of the Army changed the training of the various armies, abandoning the Japanese style exercise and adopting the German style. They changed to holding the gun on the left shoulder, and the movements were simpler. When preparing to fire, it was simpler than the Japanese exercise. This is the general overview of the army exercise and organization in our country. Since the revolutionary army's Northern Expedition, in two years, the north and the south were unified. Therefore, the organization of the various armies and the organization of the teams showed a major reform. The originally established division, brigade, and regiment system was completely abolished. The new army was organized, mostly following the National Army's three-three system. The so-called three-three system is that a division has three brigades, a brigade has three regiments, a regiment has three battalions, and a battalion has three companies. However, this refers to infantry. If it is a special force, it is also different from the original system. Before there were cavalry, engineering, artillery, transport, and machine guns, more mortar battalions were added. The central divisions have expanded their machine gun teams. In addition, there are so-called hand grenade teams. There are many names, different from the past. In the Northwest Army, there are so-called broadsword teams. The organization of each army and faction is different, and each uses its advantages and special organization. Today, the most complete divisions in the country are the central guard divisions. Not only is the number of brigades and battalions particularly large, but also the names of various arms are more numerous. The new-style military equipment is also more numerous than other armies. Therefore, its combat power is even greater. It is found that the number of the army in our country, in the past when the Northern warlords were in power, belonged to the Ministry of the Army and was subordinate to the central government. There were twenty divisions in total, called the regular army. The others were local armies, that is, each province had one to three or four army divisions, such as the Jiangsu First Division, the Zhejiang First Division, etc., called the local army. Since the Northern Expedition, the remaining central troops from before have been rare. The 3rd Division of Wu Peifu, the 10th Division of Lu Yongxiang, the 6th Division of Qi Xieyuan, the 15th Division of Feng Yuxiang, etc., were all considered elite troops at the time, but none of them exist today. The local divisions have all disappeared.</p>
<p>How many armies does our country have? Judging from the present, the most famous were originally the Central Army, the Feng Army, the Xishan-affiliated Army, the Fengtian Army, and the Sichuan Armies. Since the failure of Yan and Feng, the power of the Northwest Army has been dispersed, and the Xishan Army has also been reduced. Since the destruction of Shi Yousan's army, a change has occurred in the army again. The Fengtian Army was originally stationed outside the Guan. Since the large army entered the Guan during the attack on Shi, its power in North China has been greater. The military power in both the north and the south belongs to the central government. According to the survey last year, its military dominance is roughly as follows: (To be continued)</p>
