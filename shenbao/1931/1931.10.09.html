<p>日人之謀我東北。處心積。慮雖至微至細之處。亦用盡心計。務求於彼有利。如彼之稱我東北爲「滿蒙」即其一證。</p>
<p>日人在我東北之定期刋物。都凡二百三十四種。（據中日文化協會發表）專門書籍四百餘種。在日人每一種關於我東北問題之書報中。所謂「滿蒙」「南滿」「北滿」「關東州」「附屬地」等名詞。觸目皆是國人不察隨而衙和之。談及東北問題。不舉其固有之名稱。而亦稱曰「滿蒙問題」「附屬地」等。甚且對外文件。亦漫然引用。一言之失關係至大。國際視聽。每因此曚混。國人於此極細微之處。最應注意。母堕入日人之圈套而不自覺。</p>
<p>吾人今日所稱之「東北。」實包括遼寗吉林黑龍江熱河四省區。以其位於東北部故。稱爲「東北」「滿蒙」「滿洲」爲我歷史上過去之名稱。旣不應沿用。而包括東北之範圍與内蒙古聯爲一辭。稱曰「滿蒙。」視爲特殊區域尤無理由所　「北滿」即我東北之北部。「南滿」即我東北之南部至於「關東洲」即我之遼寗半島或全縣。「附屬地」即南鐵道兩側之「借用地。」凡此諸詞。自其表面觀之。雖無關重要。而相沿相襲樍非成是。數典忘祖寖且在吾人之意識中將不復知「滿蒙」之即我遼吉黑熱。不復知其爲我國土。所謂「滿蒙。」其地儼然與我國劃分爲一獨立之特殊區域。日人之用意即在於是即在於曚混國際之耳目。使承認我東北爲其「特權地。」並糢糊我國之人之意識。使無形承認東北爲一特殊部落。如坊間出版國人自著之東北書籍中。有所謂「中日俄三國競爭下之滿蒙」「國際競爭」下之滿蒙。」即此一語亦足使我之領土主權。無形失去日人矢野研究我國史地。牽强附會。在帝國大學公然發表東北本非爲我領土之論文。自此文發表而後。日人更嘩然響應。振振有辭。田中義一曾有云。「因我矢野博士之發表正當。故支那學者無有反對我帝國大學之立説者。最不幸者。日俄戰爭之時。我國宣戰布告。明認滿蒙爲支那領土。又華盛頓會議時。九國條約亦認滿蒙爲支那領土。因之外交上不得不認支那爲主權國。以此二種失算。致禍我帝國對滿蒙之權益。」日人之陰謀與野心。於此蓋暴露無遺。　　不特此也。日人對外宣傳。更决然認定其與我東北發生合法之關係。以中日日俄兩次戰役。爲其近世劃界之事實更謂彼在我東北。曾納「血税。」故應享有特權。又謂開發東北。爲彼國之責甚且謂我東北。如不能遷移至大西洋上。或沉入太平洋海底。即神起爭奪。日人亦决不放鬆。其强横無理。誠無以復加</p>
<p>今「滿蒙王國獨立」之呼聲已甚囂塵上矣誰爲其發縱指使者誰爲其鼓吹暗助者。蓋人皆知。彼數十年來稱我東北爲「滿蒙。」即爲今日事實之張本。日人之謀我東北。眞有若水銀瀉地。無孔不入。其一言一動。無不有其用心。國人其注意。世界人士其注意。</p>
<p>故今後我國人亟應斷然屏置日人所謂「滿蒙」「北滿」「南滿」「關東州」「附屬地」等僞名。不復沿用。以正世界之視聽。以擊破日人之陰謀。國内要電二</p>

<p>要聞</p>
<h3>滿洲事件</h3>
<p>中日初次舌戰</p>
<p>十九日午後國聯行政院席上</p>
<p>日本代表自知理曲飾詞掩卸</p>
<p>我方因未接詳報只簡單陳述</p>
<p>日内瓦特信、日本乘我國不備、深夜襲擊滿洲、侵略我國主權、違反國際公約、日本自應負全部責任、乃日人狡黠成性、不惜虚搆事實、在國際上散布種種謠言、藉以遮掩世界之耳目、謂此次戰禍、日本方面係出於正當防衛、因中國軍隊拆毁南滿鐵路、日軍上前阻止、華兵不聽、反開槍射擊、日兵不得已、方行還槍、故日軍攻擊中國、係出於自衛云、日人措詞、在熟悉我國情形者、自可知其内幕、在不熟悉情形者聽之、殊難明其中是非、故各國人士莫不希望中日兩方各爲事實之陳述、以求水落石出、本月十九日午後、國聯行政院開會、我國代表就行政委員職、同時討論國際重大問題、一般人皆以爲中日代表必短兵相接、各爲其本國辯護、以醒世人之耳目、故是日到會旁聽者、人山人海、午後五時開會、日本代表（駐巴黎大使）先起立發言、其演詞如下、「主席先生、據報紙記載、昨夜在瀋陽附近、曾有一意外之事發生、余甚欲以第一次得來之消息、向行政院報告、幸蒙足下允許、可惜此消息不甚詳盡、所可告諸君者、即中日軍隊在瀋陽及南滿鐵路附近或發生衝突是也、日本政府自聞得此消息後、即採取各種可能的方法、以使此局部事件不致擴大、余現已請示本國政府以詳細情形、余深信彼必能竭力使此事寗息也」</p>
<p>日本代表昨知該國此舉、蹂躪國際公約、破壞世界和平、爲正誼所不容、故極力將問題縮小、作此狡猾之掩飾、即此寥寥數語、其窘狀已可概見、我國理直氣壯、各方輿論亦多右我、且我國最近當選爲行政委員、大可利用機會、用報告之形式、將日本侵略我國之源源本本、昭告世人、乃其時我國代表施肇基尙未得國内詳細之報告、眞相未明、故第一次發言非常愼重、僅爲以下之陳述、「主席先生、自滿洲里發生意外之消息傳來、（即方才日本代表所陳述者）余聞後深爲不安、據余目前所接到之報告、中國乃面似未有任何舉動、足以釀此意外、以後如接到關於此項不幸事件之正式消息、余當向行政院報告、」我國代表演説後、行政院值任主席、來儒Ｌｅｒｃｏｕｘ（西班牙外交　長）　起立、謂「中日代表適間之陳述吾人已聞之矣、日本政府將採必要之手段、以緩和此種情形、行政院聞後、殊爲滿意、自不待言、余與列席各員、以極誠懇之希望、深願此項問題能得早日解决也、」主席述畢、即討論其他問題、日本故意侵略中國、蔑視凱洛公約、鄙棄國聯章程第十二條之規定、而號稱維持世界和平之國際聯盟、僅以「深願此項問題能得早日解决、」數語了之、聞者莫不失望、蓋國際聯、</p>
<p>盟本届大會、正在討論弭兵之際、日本忽冒世界之大不韙、進攻中國、此間人聞之不啻空中霹靂、如行政院不出而干涉、爲公平之制裁、而一任人類公敵逍遙法外、國際和平之前途、殊末　　觀也、（二十日上午）</p>
<h3>遼吉</h3>
<p>日軍毫無撤意</p>
<p>錦縣通信、自國聯提議日本撤兵以來、日本方面即極力宣傳、將所有進駐遼寗各地日軍、概行撤入南滿鐵路沿線、實則此不過一種宣傳之詞而已、截至現在止、其所佔領中國各要塞之軍隊、並無一兵一卒實行撤退、茲將日本聲明撤兵後之行動、彙誌如次、以示日本之陰謀、方興未艾也、</p>
<p>積極準備永久佔領遼寗城内、迄今仍駐有重兵、且於北門東門附近、積極準備防禦工事、更於北寗路沿線之巨流河車站、修築戰壕、配置相當兵力、並有大中日軍於十月二日晚乘鐵甲車兩列、以剿匪爲名、開過新民以西白旗堡一帶、且有西進模様、此外日本復以大兵將遼源實行佔領、並在其左近、設立一大規模之飛機塲、將在瀋陽所搶之中國飛機、重行塗色、盡數運此、以爲轟炸東省各城市及襲擊火車之用、是日本雖向國際宣傳即日撤兵、而實則無時無地、不作長久佔領之準備、所謂撤兵、其誰信之、</p>
<p>搶案迭出置不過問省城自被日軍侵佔後、日人即施其殘酷手叚、以對待我國人民、首則縱兵淫掠、繼則煽重朝鮮及日本之浪人、到處强搶、並將維持地方之公安局、放火燒毁、此外復于上月二十一日、將東北糧𥞊�</p>
<p>、並侵佔電軍廠及公共汽車廠、所有員可盡被驅逐、且連日以來、搶案迭出、日軍置不過問、因之市民終日恐慌、商號迄未復業、</p>
<p>開獄縱囚破壞秩序除上述種種外、日人又到處運用陰謀手叚、以圖破壞我國社會之秩序、譬如日軍每佔領一中國縣城、即將監獄内之囚犯、擇其罪大惡極者、先後開釋、其目的在使彼等亡命之徒、擾亂地方汉安、搖動中國之統治權、至基公盜賣國土等案入獄者、非但首先釋放、且立時引用、以爲其爪牙、日本雖聲明並未縱囚、然事實俱在、固不容其狡辯也、</p>
<p>强以奉票收買糧食除縱囚以外、日本最近又以大宗奉票、到南滿瀋海吉長吉敦等鐵路沿線各地、收買糧食、中國人民之不願出賣者、日本即以威嚇手叚、武力强迫、國人處其淫威之下、不得不唯命是從、因之東北今年收穫之新糧、盡被日人收買、將來日人擬以金票、流通市面、使奉票完全失敗、以期陷　北民生於絶境、其用心可謂毒矣、</p>
<p>武力强築吉會鐵路最足使吾人驚心者、則爲日本强築吉會路、而藉以盆掠中國之領土、據最近吉林來人云、日本自將延吉佔領後、即實行以武力强迫中國農工、晝夜工作、積極進行、約計再有半月、吉會鐵路便可完成、該處中國人民、稍不聽其指使、便遭慘死、日本並欲於吉會路完成之日、即將沿線之中國居民、盡行、驅逐、然後將大批韓人移入、實行墾殖、將該處實行變爲日本之殖民地、苟吾國當局不設法制止、則在最短期内、吉會沿線之土地、恐非吾所有矣、</p>
<p>李毅無恥靦然就職連日遼寗省城及吉林省城、均有四民維持會之組織、其中以維持地方治安爲目的者、固不乏人、然因受日人之强迫與嗾使、起而爲虎作倀者、實亦大有人在、如最近袁金鎧于冲漢等在瀋陽組織地方治安維持委員會、熙洽等在吉林組織自治政府、純係受日人之唆使、日本之所以如此、無非欲以亡朝鮮之故技、亡我中華、而我國亦居然有人願作李完用、恬不知恥、是誠吾民族之奇恥大辱、然袁等雖受日人指使、尙未正式受日人任命、乃不圖近日又有李毅受日本僞瀋陽市長土肥正式委任爲瀋陽民政署長之事、李毅原爲瀋陽縣長、自瀋陽被占後、李被日本迫出而維持地方治安、日人對之認爲得力、最近土肥竟委李爲瀋民政署長、而李亦竟于十月一日遵令就職、此等喪心病狂、覥顏事仇之舉、又誠袁于等之不若也、（九月四日）</p>
<h3>吉垣最近情形</h3>
<p>報紙多已停版</p>
<p>學校無一上課</p>
<p>吉林通信、日軍到吉後、吉垣報社大受壓迫、警備司令坪井、傳知各報、須受檢查每日下午三時將大様送到司令部、由坪井簽閲發還、凡軍事行動及不利日軍之字句、概所不許省城華文報只吉長日報一家、因大様早拼、時間不及、故只出一大張、而新聞只一版地位、餘則盡是廣告、所登新聞、多半不關時局、故銷路大减、而外報則利用時機、大加擴充、銷塲激增、此固勢所必至之事、自時局變動、凡素日敢言之華報、莫不停版、瀋陽民報勿論矣、長春大東報因當　　　事變號外、已首被搗毁、</p>
<p>當日軍進吉之前、駐省軍隊即奉令調開、藉避衝突、其後退出之隊伍亦被繳械、邊防副司令署衛隊團團長馮壽山、當日軍開進吉垣之晨、熙洽令其外遷、次日又令繳械、馮氏憤甚、激勵部下、謂寗死不能繳械、當即督率全部人馬循吉海路南下、其後日飛機偵察該軍行踪、謂已入　甸縣深山中、離鐵道線甚遠、日軍卒無如何、馮部番號、爲六八二團、隨帶軍械餉糈、並車輛皮棉軍衣、甚爲完備、爲吉林勁旅、凡一千五百餘人、當熙洽與日方會商該旅繳械問題、熙言馮氏已不聽命、本人無法執行、多門謂熙無誠意、熙氏大窘、後多門自爲轉圜、使熙氏負治安全責、長官新官制因以產生焉、</p>
<p>日軍飛機偵察、已三日不來即日軍數目、亦已少减、聞日方雖號稱二千七百名、但除開赴敦化及撤回長春者外、目下</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>接要聞</p>
<p>只剩數百名、其中大部住在車站恒茂火磨公司、一部住長官公署、一部住軍政廳、少數住在领事館及滿鐵社宅、惟日軍雖少、近又來到日憲兵十數名、强住交涉署内、大書「吉林日本憲兵隊」等字掛於門首、</p>
<p>日軍坪井司令通知敎育廳、轉飭各校開學、但各校學生心痛國難、相約罷課、故至今多日、均未上課、東局子軍械廠附近之五中一師兩校、因有日軍住在、校内更　其無人、因外縣學生多已回里、省城學生亦避遠日軍、不敢到校、</p>
<p>日軍到後、首將省黨部佔領、高樹日本國旗、日人對黨部本極痛恨、黨委韓介生氏兼充軍法會審處長、鮮人共犯多由韓氏審問、鮮人甚嫉視之、日軍到吉之次日、即將韓逮捕、至今未放、傳有生命危險、而在延敦各處捕押之鮮犯、經日軍於監獄中提出二百四十三名、一律釋放、反日之鮮人六名、則一律處死焉、（十月一日）</p>
<h3>外商抗議</h3>
<p>日軍强封華銀行</p>
<p>大美晚報七日瀋陽（由日本轉滬）電云、此間英美等國外商聯合向日本軍事當道抗議封閉官辦華銀行、如邊業及東三省銀行等後、今日已得日軍事當道復函稱、此舉因時局不靖、爲保護銀行計、不得不然、日軍事當道並無妨礙存戶權利意、且亦亟願邊業與東三省銀行復業、料兩行迅即可以重開云云、此間華商人稱、日人乘武力佔據機會、將擴張經濟利益、俾可控制南滿内蒙、尤其對於久在爭執中之各鐵路、今日關東軍司令本莊聲稱、今晨上午二時有七十七聯隊兵士一百名、携野砲十二尊、乘北寗車七輛開往北寗路之巨流河因新民北首遼河右岸聚集中國散兵一千三百餘名、故派日軍往保護居民云云、按此項散兵、似係前北大營駐軍、現繞道至北寗路、擬乘車往錦州者、</p>

<h3>日本滿蒙權益擁護秘密會議</h3>
<p>記錄譯要</p>
<p>此項秘密會議錄、乃日本浪人竊售於我國人者茲當倭人乘我災禍佔我遼吉之時、至友本會執委汪君旦速居哈爾濱、惕於國亡無日、禍至無時、亟以此秘密會議錄見賜、予受而讀之、乃知我國天災人禍交迫之時間、即日人所視爲天賜之機會、而現在指使復辟派在滿蒙運動建國、及促令　匪危害鐵道安全、均係預定之計畫、至其研究國際情勢、與如何威迫利誘我東北當局之手段、皆極鬼蜮毒辣、無非藉擁議在滿旣得權爲口實、圖達日本最後之目的、（即呑併滿蒙而完成大陸政策）讀者幸毋以内容多注重於鐵道權利之研討、而急視其政治上之企圖焉、劉陸民　、</p>
<p>（一）時期、去年十二月七日午前九時至午後二時、（二）會場拓務省大臣辦公室、（三）出席、松田拓相·仙石總裁·木村理事·外務省吉田永井二镒官·拓務省小村小坡二次官·武家參與官·松永條約局長·亞細亞局長·軍部陸軍次官·參謀次官·及第一課長、（四）議决、（甲）奉派欲將滿蒙外交權名實共歸南京、吾人對之、取外寛内嚴之法、以反對之、更借題發揮、强其仍以張學良爲外交負責長官、以便帝國保持其特殊地位及特權、（乙）對奉派鐵路網之建設取干涉的態度、以阻其實現特以迫戰求和策略、誘其與我協調、滿蒙鐵道運價與貨物吸收區域之限制、似此方足永保南滿路與大連港之繁榮、俟天賜機會來、可達帝國對滿蒙目的、</p>
<p>木村理事對於提案之説明云、怪傑張學良對我以萬馬奔騰之勢、南以其外交畀之王家楨、北以其鐵道畀之高紀毅、互相分題合作、一舉而欲粉碎我滿蒙之特權、然蔣張乃吳越同舟······而奉派中又有新舊二派、互相水火、······依我陸軍參謀部之努力運動奉派内部之大瓦解、是旣定之必然、可拭目以待也、</p>
<p>張學良政治之背後、尙有散在滿蒙和地之馬賊團、共四千餘名、又八千餘之復辟派等、無不仰我鼻息、受我懷柔、萬一奉派内部之軋轢表面化時、斯二者使之合流爲一、而特以不良無賴之朝鮮人加担之、······斯時無論我欲傾向橷派或扶助舊派、抑或竟使滿蒙或爲復辟派之天下、以達到吾人之理想、此皆可依我國利益如何而斷定、（陸民按）使滿蒙爲復辟派之天下、即達到日人之理想、是理想也、何理想耶、蓋即使滿蒙爲朝鮮第二之理想耳、望國人注、意日本此次横暴兇殘之行動、正欲實現上述之理想、若馬賊及復辟派等認賊作父、其罪固不容誅、而其愚亦不可及已、</p>
<p>歐戰後華盛頓會議所締結之九國協約、無不束縛帝國在滿蒙之自由行動、如帝國果以急進形帝國主義以臨之、必一舉而惹起各國之誤解、因此種關係、故滿蒙政策必須在國際方面在中國方面都有機會、方可斷行、非如張作霖政府時代、凡事皆可依我之意見、夫滿鐵所以犧牲二十餘萬、使用總員八百餘名、作成滿蒙馬賊底册、並懷柔其頭目者、無非因欲製造此種機會、而參謀部利用黑龍會愛國會大化會等、與帝制派聯給者、亦不過欲製造其機會耳他如特别組織營口葫蘆島及北寗路等之秘密調查機關······如運動烏蘇里及東鐵之赤俄當局與我提携者、是皆因欲導我權益之進展、而努力爲之也、按滿鐵作此潛航式之努力、並犧牲如許鉅大金錢、無非欲造成我天賜之機會、以便輔助我滿蒙政策、成爲金城鐵壁、於此足證仙石總裁對滿蒙之難題、無不極欲謀根本的有利之解决、以樹國家百年之大計、斷非如外間所宣傳之無能無策也明矣、（陸民按）日本今日斷行滿蒙政策、觀上説明、蓋鑒於國際金融恐慌、我國災禍洊至、所謂天賜機會之到來、故敢爲圖達最後目的之措置、近以國際空氣不佳、又指使復辟派與馬賊妄肆搗亂、倭人雖狡、其如世界耳目難以一手掩飾何哉、（未完）</p>

<h3>爲日本暴行敬告敎育界</h3>
<p>（三）舒新城</p>
<p>三·精神力我提出「精神力」三字、一定會有人笑爲迂腐的、實則人類之所以異於其他動物者就在於物慾之外、還有精神作用、所謂民氣、所謂國魂、無非是此精神作用的表現、所謂志士希殺身成仁、所謂忠臣忠君報國、無非受此精神作用之支配、我國三十年來、因内亂頻仍、維繫國家之中心思想、中心信仰、已破壞無餘、而外侮相逼、屢次失敗、國民對於安邦定國的自信力亦日漸减薄今日之敎育除了物力的增加外、在精神方面、我友爲至少要注意下列幾事、</p>
<p>甲·自信力的培養、我國建國最古、文化亦最早、無論從國體方面或個人方面、都可證明我們的聰明容智並不如人、雖然近年因外患内亂的交逼、致使國勢不振然而是暫時的、而且是過渡時代所不能免的（法國革命即其先例）我國民不當烃此自餒、應自信有發揚國光的能力、應自信可因國民的努力將中國永久巍存於世界之上、這種仰念、應該從歷史地理的敎科上去培養、對於現在種種懼外媚外的種種卑淺心理、應當一絲不放鬆地、（如郵票及商店發票用英文等小事影響於國民自尊心者甚大、不可以其小忽之、）從事實上驅除之、</p>
<p>乙·法治精神的培養、中國因焉歷史上的種種原因人民最缺法治精神、在閉關自守的時代人治尙可以自存、現在則非法治不能立國這種精神之缺乏、一方面减少團結力和進取心、一方面增進自私心和僥倖心、（此次日本地震乃至報紙亦顯幸災榮禍之意國民之僥倖心理完全暴露無餘、）同時也就是内亂之源、敎育者要認清這種弊害、以身作則實地訓練青年去實行法治、丙·愛國心的培養國家是我國民寄身託命之所、好的存亡休戚與國民個人有切膚的關係、有人侵犯我國家者、即是侵犯我自己、爲國家死難爲國家復仇與爲個人死難爲個人復仇有同様的意義同様的重要、而前者比後者尤爲光榮、因爲能犧牲小己保全大我也、此義現在已少人提及、敎育界爲着、「政治是一件火辣的東西、」甚至於連國家兩字亦不説、但是「天下興亡、匹夫有責」當此國家危急存亡之秋、先覺的敎育界、如何能坐視不理培養於青年慷慨同仇的愛國心、實是現敎育上的一種先務、</p>

<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。日艦不淶。固然可以相安無事日艦來　　了。那也是意計中事。無所用其驚慌。因爲他們在没揭穿假面具以前。總説是保護他們的僑民來的。我們姑妄聽之。力持鎭靜態度。看他們弄出甚麽花様來。然而一般明哲保身的閘北民衆。一聽得日艦進了吳淞口。又輕信了些無意識的謠言。早在紛紛的遷徒了。其實他們連日兵的影子。都還没有看見。何必如此急急。致使日人笑我們胆小如鼠。萬一眞要亡國。那麽任你逃到天盡頭地角裏去。也總於是一個亡國奴。身家性命。更有甚麽希罕。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>愛之三字經</h3>
<p>愛神當人未出世之前，給他或伊一杯愛露説：「你把這杯愛露拿　　去，好好的保存著，只可以和你最愛的一位愛人同喝！」這是維那絲Ｖｅｎｕｓ的命令，一個字也不能違背。你看那個「只」字和那個「最」字是説得多麽清楚啊！如果你只和你最愛的人同喝，那愛露是蜜様甜；若隨便給人喝，它會變成醋，變成毒藥。現在青年們提起纞愛便覺得津津有味。我也並不反對。可是有許多青年對於愛人大有韓信將兵，多多益善之勢，終日在醋缸，熼坑，毒氣房裏流連，把國也忘了，學問也忘了，事業也忘了，生命也忘了，弄得身敗名裂，悔之無及。去年黃白英被情人强迫服毒時，我曾寫了一篇三字經勸告我的青年朋友，現在我要把它獻給全國的青年説：「幸福只在專愛裏！」我寫的三字經是··「「愛之酒，</p>
<p>甜而苦。</p>
<p>兩人喝，</p>
<p>是甘露。</p>
<p>三人喝，</p>
<p>酸如醋。</p>
<p>隨便喝，</p>
<p>毒中毒。」</p>
<p>我寫這三字經兒，</p>
<p>人人都要讀得熟！」</p>
<h3>日併韓的時慘史一頁</h3>
<p>— 自在</p>
<p>暴日横行。舉世同憤。然吾人追述庚　　戌七月十八。日本强佔高麗之一頁傷心史。當必　而悟覺而思也。馬關條約締結以還。全韓風雲驟然變色。識者早已知斯土之非李氏享有也。然當時韓皇受日本之口蜜腹劍。慫思恿獨立。以爲金城湯池之基。子孫帝王萬世之業。確定斯舉。因自加徽號云。「天運肇極敦倫正聖光義明功大德堯峻舜徽禹謨湯敬應命主紀至化神烈巍勛洪業啓基宣歷乾行坤定英毅宏休大皇帝。」長至四十九字之多。可謂魚游釜中不知死期之將至矣。當日本强佔高麗之日。開御前會議。是日也。韓國内閣總理大臣李完用。趙農相。朴内相高度相。皇族代表者興王李載冕。中樞院代者金議長。以及日派專員齊集仁政殿無何。韓皇隨尹侍從高禮式課長出韓賊李完用趨前奏言。「臣觀世界之大勢。韓國之現狀。爲高麗國民福利計。莫若奉韓國土地。獻於日本。永受保護。數日以來。閣臣愼重會議。敢奏皇上裁可。」韓皇斯時閉目蹙額。半晌方言曰「所奏已明白了。萬事憑卿等處理。」言罷涙涔涔下。殿上文武。除　預約者外多爲悽然。而三韓國運盡於此矣。　　日本併韓國後。設統監府馭治。明野志士。切齒腐心。悲專制之壓迫。悼祖國之淪亡倡言反抗者。前仆後繼。并造成民七年獨立大運動。徒以力微失助。致中道挫折。然其不屈不撓之革命精神。至今尙不稍止。因中華革命尙未成功。三韓民族。尙難獨立。此則無可欵義者。嗟乎茫茫前途。沈沈大陸。翹首東北。悽然欲絶。我國民鑒於日人之暴行。三韓之慘亡讀此一頁韓國亡國史。能不灑一掬同情之涙。奮起而救國乎。否則當爲韓民之續矣</p>
<h3>暴跡留存之冷香閣</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>冷香閣者。我吳虎阜之名勝地也。朅　　來滬上。足跡未臨其地者有年。回首舊游。恍如隔世。閣　立山半。有高屋建瓴之勢。爲鄕前輩金鶴望汪鼎丞諸先生董之而成。周圍植梅三百本。冷香一片。因以顏閣。初春之際。有和靖癖者。相率巡檐索笑於其間。秋日氣爽。又聯袂登臨之爲樂。長夏快風。嚴冬皎雪。亦多結俊侶而來。歲序四時。殊不落寞。也據閣品荈。望靈巖支硎上方獅嶺諸峰巒歷歷在目。而京滬列輦。蜿　行於翠藹叢莽中。鳥瞰之餘。别有景趣。猶憶某次予與諸同文雅集於冷香閣上。施君濟羣。見列輦詫爲奇觀。不覺脱口而呼曰。遠看火車像條蛇。程丈瞻廬以其恰爲七言。彷彿打油詩腔也。乃戲爲之續曰近看火車像部車。若然弗遠也弗近。頭如車來尾如蛇。相與拊掌大笑。不料事隔數日。暴倭竟以槍殺我華健兒聞矣。健兒胡宗漢。偶來此間眺賞。暴倭二三乘射獵之餘興。亦涉足爲登閣之游客。見胡宗漢身御戎服。有意辱怒之。宗漢報以惡聲。暴倭即出槍彈以殪之。陳尸閣中者數日。寃讐終未申雪。此次暴倭鐵蹄。蹂躪我華疆土。殘害同胞。不可僂指計。想胡宗漢魂兮有知。天陰雨慘。當啾作靈嘯於山丘崇閣畔矣。</p>
<h3>忍涙錄</h3>
<p>— 靈岫</p>
<p>國難方殷。思之痛心。然洋塲十里。依　　然沉浸於金迷紙醉之中。人心已死。可勝浩嘆。敎部近有一令。令各地電影院選映愛國影片。以爲民情激厲。自爲電影同業所亟應遵行。然國產影片之能有愛國思想之表見者。爲數甚少。頻年所見。蓋祗有明星影片公司之「新西游記」「黑衣女俠」「奮鬬的婚姻」「好男兒」等數片而已。頗望國產片商。各本愛國熱忱。多多攝製此類影片。以造成藝術宣傳之最大力量。民族精神之復興。利賴實多。日人素殘忍。國内極力提倡軍國民敎育。凡一切非戰之小説以及影片。皆在禁止之列。環公司之「西線無戰事」一片。亦嘗運往日本。惟各地均不能開映片商損失甚巨。至其自攝之影片。則於武士道之提倡。不遺餘力。於此益可以見其野心之一般也。</p>

<h3>故都聞見錄</h3>
<p>— 皇穹宇</p>
<p>天壇佔地之廣。過於大内。壇牆以内。古樹交蔭。縟草紛披。幾疑身在郊野。蓋明代築壇本在　　南效。至萬歷間。北邊警報日至。慮猝有强寇憑陵。乃築外城圈人之也。牆内隙地。自生益母草。有人專采此物製益母　。視他處所產尤效。昔年傳太廟獨產灰鶴。以松柏爲巢。與天壇之草。並爲靈產也。壇三成。白石闌陛。高庳周徑。皆有定數。壇北爲皇穹宇。所以備遇雨行禮之所。皇穹宇北爲祈年殿。皆重檐複撩。金碧輝煥。歐人游北平者。尤驚歎皇穹宇之美絶。蓋以屋頂至重。而楹間相去又闊。匀配重力。獨具匠心。能代表東方最高等之建築藝術耳。宮殿廟宇。無不取長方形。惟皇穹宇爲圓式。誠爲傑構。</p>
<p>光緒已丑八月二十四日寅刻。雷電交作。大雨如注。忽祈年殿殿額着火。因而延燒。至未刻而殿中烟燄自瑣窗中出。燒着梁柱。其光熊熊如虹亘天。於是步軍統領發令箭調兵奔救。而以殿宇過高。水激不到。卒致八十一楹之大殿悉成煨燼。香氣四溢。播及通衢。蓋殿材皆楠木而神牌則檀木也。甚至丹陛上之漢白玉。（西山產白石。質若瑤珉。宮中爛檻階戺多製以此物。謂之漢白玉。）闌干悉致炸裂。眞奇災也。平時宮殿之災多歸咎於典守者。若祈年殿似無可盜之的。不知何以致此。事後重修。工官徧檢則例。竟未載其矩度。幸覓得一老匠。曾與修繕之役。稍憶其結構。苦思方索。方得畢工云。</p>
<p>聲涙俱下。則國人之憤於國難而欲哭無涙者。俟「紅涙影」出映時。或即以此爲引涙之工具可耳。忍涙書此。竊願此悱惻之「紅涙」。化而爲愛國之熱涙。</p>

<h3>級會</h3>
<p>— 本務珊</p>
<p>早上、上第一的課的鐘聲、冲破了冷靜的空氣後、同學們有的珊珊的拿了一大疊書、從宿舍裏出來、有的從閲報室出來、一邊談着、一邊徐的走進敎室、　　「哦、冷血動物、你們倒會這様安定的做你們的算術題呵、······嘻、你們眞似着了算術的迷了、」</p>
<p>「不要這様昏迷不醒的算了、現在不是算的時候了、丨丨而且、你們想想、你們到底算到了些甚麽呢、這重大的日本强佔我南滿的事件、你們可曾算到、」慕和鈺從閲報室出來、走進敎室、見他們隣座的同學、都聚在一處靜靜地、似乎很有興味的算着、就不禁打趣似的和他們説　　「冷血動物、算你們消息靈通、丨丨我們昨晚費了我們整個的温夜課的時間、來會議怎様表示我們對待日本强佔南滿的事、今天這一課、等所有的同學到齊了、你們知道要做甚麽事嗎」、萸得意地、又冷嘲似地説着、當他把算術敎本、練習簿等的東西、一一的塞進抽屜裏、　　「我們要開個級會、計論關於日本侵佔我國土之事」、級長李、也就是開會時的主席、正經地對慕和鈺説着、　　一會、全級的同學都到齊了、主席李似唉非唉地走上講台、在喉間霍霍的作了幾聲咳痰聲後、就報告着正式開會、以下、就問着我們、用甚麽方法表不我們對日本的態度、</p>
<p>的有的同學、在没有想到回答主席之話前、這授第一課的算術先生開始出現躊躇在敎室門前了、</p>
<p>「哦、王先生、我們很對不起你、請你借幾分鐘給我們開級會、開好了、我們再上課、」主席李一邊把躊躇在敎室外的算術先生迎了進來、一邊似乎很恭敬、莊嚴的説着、</p>
<p>「哦、開級會、丨哦、呌我「借幾分鐘給你們」這話是不對的、那是你們的時間、不是我的時間呢、又「對不起你」這話更不對、因爲······」算術先生的話、可以説是很牢騷的、但是因爲他説時的態度、不是正經而是滑稽、面上所現的、不是不高興的色彩、而是同情的微嘆、所以同學們都絶不爲意的反閧然的大家都嘆了起來、以致把算術先生的話打斷了、</p>
<p>「我們這學校、在上海旨數一數二的、處在領袖地位學校、所以我想我們表示我們對日本的態度、應該熱烈些、而且對於我們上課的時間、尤應該多犧牲犧牲、所以我主張我們大家都犧牲上課、到校外街上去演講、給一般平民聽我們中國所處地位的危困、和日本的惡毒的野心」。慕首先提議着、當他説完了、坐下來的時候、他對算術先生望了一眼、那時、那算術先生、也正注意着她、</p>
<p>許多的同學、多紛紛的反對、有的説、「在街上演説是混亂社會秩序的、」有的説、「女子的説話聲、比較輕微些、所以不配在大庭廣衆的街上演説的」、有的説、「校長、敎務主任、訓育主任、必定不答應我們出去演講的、他們對着我們、雖也喊着熱烈的口號、但是這是給我們聽聽的、不是給我們照了他實行的、有的説、「······」許多許多反對的意見、</p>
<p>這様的、這邊一件件的提出、那邊一條條的推反、最後王先生説、「照如此的辯論下去、這個會是開不完的了、你們不如馬馬虎虎······哦、不是馬虎······你們不如寫些標語、到各處去貼好了、」同學們聽了王先生的話、於是頓然的嚷成一片了、有的説着、「我方想説出來、可恰巧被王先生搶先説了」、有的説着、「單貼些標語、似乎太簡單了」有的説着、「······」但是、這者不關緊要的、因爲這條提到、到底得了大多數同學的和議而成立了、</p>
<p>王先生一聽見我們把他的提議成立了、於是得意洋洋地説、「眞可惜呵、這個提議我老早就想到的、不然、假使我早説了出來、我們這時不是可在上課了嗎、但是、雖然、現在你們散了會吧、所要進行的事、待散課後做吧······哦拿出書本來、我要敎書了、」王先生慢慢地找尋着他上一時所授過的一頁、打算敎下去了、　　「王先生、你太和我們打算、你不知道我們是很願意犧牲我們的時間的嗎、假如在須要我們犧牲的時候、」</p>
<p>「哦、大家贊成不贊成這時就來磨墨、裁紙頭、和寫標語嗎、」</p>
<p>「算術先生、反　是我們的時間、索性讓我們幹完了這件事再敎吧、」</p>
<p>「哦、半個鐘頭也不滿了、王先生、你到敎員室去休息休息吧、在這様緊急的時候我們眞無心上課呵、」</p>
<p>「王先生、相帮我們想幾個標語好嗎、因爲你或者想得到何等様的標語、使人見了不易會忘却的、」</p>
<p>「呵、眞的、算術先生、你眞可大顯神通、來算一算呢、」</p>
<p>許多喜歡胡閙的同學、都我一句你一句的、正經着臉、假悵做恭恭敬敬的、起立了對王先生説着、</p>
<p>「好了、聽你們歡喜做甚麽、就做甚麽吧、你們原是犧牲你們的光陰、來做你們的愛國舉動呵、」王先説完了、冷冷的走出敎室、那時、其他各級正在上課、除了敎師們的聲音外、一切都是靜寂的、「槖······」很分明的、寥落的王先生的皮鞋聲、徐緩的響着、好似嘆息着、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<p>日本勢力下二十年來之滿蒙湯增敭</p>
<p>編著者丨丨陳經</p>
<p>現在、巳是國難臨頭民族存亡的生死關鍵了、連日來報紙上緊張的消息、哀痛悲慘的呼聲、已轟震了中原和全世界、日本這次侵略東北、掠奪我的土地物權、殘殺我的同胞、鐵蹄所至、慘無人道、而復進兵窺探青島天津北平南京上海等要地、誇耀示威、引釁挑戰、意圖併呑、這種萬象森嚴驚心動魄的景象、使我國家有朝不保夕之虞、</p>
<p>然而人必自腐、而後人侮之、我們祗要用心些推究今日這危急的原因、我們不能不痛恨二十年來國人對於滿蒙太不關心了、這種疏忽和失策、就是漸漸地演成了今日的慘禍、</p>
<p>因此、「日本勢力下二十年來之滿蒙」一書、眞是酣夢中的一聲清夜的洪鐘、簡直把日本帝國那様猙獰侵呑的面目和可怕的情象盡態畫現出來在我們的目前、給國人以一個猛省宜速起自圖的警惕、　　滿蒙是「遠東問題」中爲列强爭奪的焦點、而日本尤以發展生存的關係愈切、地以「滿蒙問題」代表了一切、明顯着地的集中侵略、從特殊的關係上得到特殊的利益、</p>
<p>日本侵略滿蒙、是牠二十年來「大陸政策」的實施、也就是在牠的掠取原料與販賣商品的殖民方式上、促進了牠資本主義的最後階段、</p>
<p>「日本勢力下二十年之滿蒙」這書編著的動機、彷彿是著者陳經先生在異國時每天生裏所接觸着的一種不可思議的食品「味噌湯」灌下白飯那味道中所抑迫出來的聯想和印象、我們看他在「寫完了這書的回憶」中的一段、</p>
<p>「我們中國東三省的遼東半島的大連　　地方日本工塲内製造了這東西一百　　餘萬斤、奉天的日本工塲内製造了　　一百餘萬斤、南滿鐵道沿綫的公主　　嶺的日本工塲也製造了四萬餘斤、　　去年由滿洲運入日本供牠食用的計　　有三百餘萬斤、價值幾十餘萬元、這　　些「味噌」是從滿蒙四千餘石的大豆　　一部分分製造出來的、這四千石大　　豆是由滿蒙四萬餘畝耕地並由無數　　民數的汗血培養出來的、去年南滿　　運入日本的大豆有二千五百餘萬斤　　、這些大豆也有一部分變成了「味噌　　一、這些「味噌」中也許有極微極微部　　分是給我吃了的、」</p>
<p>從嘗「味噌」的味道想到故國的情景、愈痛感到一滴一滴的鮮血被人家榨取去了、這是著者最引爲痛心的、而這、也許已是滿蒙政策在現實中的一個縮影、　　本書分析日本在滿蒙二十年來的根深蒂固的殖民政策、如日本在滿蒙的殖民是多少數目、他採用何種方法以解决他的殖民的生活、以及日本對於朝鮮的移民政策是怎様、這些朝鮮的人數是若干、其程度與性質是怎様、他們移殖在甚麽地方、日本對此採用何種方針、他如何强制他們、如何利用他們、其次日本對於滿蒙政治上是如何壓迫、在經濟上是如何掠奪丨他怎様投資、怎様掠取原料與勞動力、怎様販賣牠的剩餘商品、怎様榨取利潤和貨幣丨丨怎様在交通事業上從事壟斷、怎様在文化事業上從事侵略、最後要發展牠的殖民政策到如何程、凡此等等、本書裏都有加以相當的分析、　　本書對於日本殖民在滿蒙的人數與其性質、及其移殖方法、移殖地方、則以人口爲對象、這是日本殖民政策的輪廓、就是本書的總論、至於滿蒙在政治經濟交通文化爲對象、各面被日本壓迫侵略的各方面形態、都是日本殖民政策的機能的運用、這是由輪廓説到實力的、即爲本書的各論、</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>總論是叙述日本殖民滿蒙的概况、分一二兩章、</p>
<p>第一章説明日本人口急增與其滿蒙殖民的關係、日本從維新以後、即自一八七○年（明治三年）到了一九二○年的五七年問、人口由三千三百餘萬人急增到五千五百九十餘萬人、已大非其在六百年前到一八六八年的產業未發達的人口增加率那様的遲緩可比、爲了人口急增物質恐慌的緣故、於是便向着我國東三省内蒙來殖民、實現其掠奪土地及資本的政策、牠殖民的方式、一是直接的向滿蒙殖民、是牠在二十年前巳經揭出四百萬滿蒙殖民的口號、看書中各年度日人在滿蒙的戶口和人口表格、就知日人在滿蒙殖民人口逐年增加、以租借地與鐵道沿線附屬地爲集中地點、漸漸浸淫到滿蒙深奥各處、一是間接的向滿蒙殖民、日本初則移民於朝鮮境内、次則驅迫朝鮮民衆移殖於滿蒙、這様間接的由朝鮮人移殖於滿蒙的總數、竟爲日本人在滿蒙的總數五倍以上、這實在是日本辛辣的政策、明顯地表現日本帝國主義的野心、</p>
<p>第二章述説日本整個的殖民政策與其滿蒙殖民政策的關係、原來日本的殖民政策是根據三種論調而分道實現的、（一）大亞細亞政策、就是由滿蒙侵略到亞洲的全部、也稱做北進論、（二）南進論、殖民於南洋羣島、澳洲及美洲的廣大的太平洋沿岸、以建設新日本的政策、（三）宇内混同的秘策、是向全世界到處殖民的政策、但是南進論和宇内混秘策、抵觸着歐美帝國主義的殖民策略、結果在美國及英屬自治殖民地裏受了英美嚴厲的排擠、都没有開展的可能、所以日本只好轉了殖民的論調、專力向着東三省内蒙進攻、即實現所謂北進論、</p>
<p>日本向着滿蒙殖民的形態、是牠與世界各帝國主義競爭殖民地及侵略國外弱小民族和壓迫國内弱小民衆的結果、牠對於滿蒙在國内講求拓殖和朝鮮一様看待、其内務省則辦理殖民的收容、保護、監督並促進海外移住組合的事務、外務省則辦理補助殖民渡航費及出版調查殖民的報告、牠近年來振興殖民的綱要、綜合起來、（一）殖民思想的涵養及普及、（二）着重於滿蒙的出版宣傳及組織協會的活動能力、（三）發揮日本各殖民地間相互生產的關係及其特色、（四）利用殖民政策以應付最近日本國内農村小作民的爭紛問題　　各論是説明日本對於滿蒙的殖民政策的機能、完全是集中在不平等條件的政治力量上、而靠着軍隊做這種條约的拓殖者及擁護者、或用金錢勾結軍閥政客們而構成的、中國在這些不正常條約上最重大的損失、（一）關於土地的租借權行政權及居住自由權等、（二）關於鐵道的經營　借欵權等、（三）關於礦產森林的採掘權和公司的合辦權等、（四）關於關税的免除權或减輕權特權等等、要之日本在滿蒙所得到這些權利、都是不平等條約得來的、</p>
<p>本章詳述（一）日本在滿蒙配置的政治努力及其組織、（二）日本在滿蒙實施警權及特殊形態、（三）日本在滿蒙剥削的賦税及雜捐、（四）日本在滿蒙配置的軍隊及其勢力等問題、都有精細的探討並附有表格多種、</p>
<p>第一編歷述日本經濟侵略的機能、是由於不均衡輸入之作用、列爲五章、第一章、對於原料的掠取、如（一）滿蒙的礦產、（二）滿蒙的森林、（三）滿蒙的畜產、（四）滿蒙的水產、（五）滿蒙的農產、第二章、對於商工業的投資、如（一）金融上的支配、（二）貨幣上的壟斷、（三）貿易上的獨占、（四）商業、（五）工業等等、第硏章、交通、如（一）鐵道、（二）航業、（三）通訊等等、第四章、文化、如（一）敎育、（二）宗敎、（三）出版界等項、都是以統計做論點的、此後便餘論了、</p>
<p>我把這書做一個概要的介紹的工作如上告小束結了、我心中感覺得無限感想、我們雖在痛恨日本在東北的暴行、共濟國難、然而他們平日這種有組織有準備的工作和精神、又不得不使我驚絶了、　　這書中的材料是很豐富、有些挿圖和表格是不易容找得的、希望讀者應當格外注意、把讀後的印象深深地留在腦際、做爲我們精神和理智之堅緊的燃料、</p>

<p>平日素主用功讀便是救國的我、到了這個危急的關頭、我也不能再鎭靜我奔騰的熱身汹湧的情感了、實在啊·處在這麽麻木不仁的無抵抗主義者的蒙蔽之下、再不是我們的讀書的時候了、因爲救國的責任能夠担負者祗有我們心地純潔的青年與民衆、我已恍然大悟、　　書本我不敢不抛下、身子不能不移向外面、站在讀書不忘救國的旗幟之下、我終於加入了抗日救國會當了、員戰士、怒火燃燒着我的内心、憤慨激發着我的胸隔、我不禁在搖動的小旗之下喊出了這様的醒語、「救國不能無抵抗地等待敵人良心的發現、因爲野獸决没有天良、救國也不能倚賴列强公正的拯援、因爲世界已泯滅了公理、要救垂危的中國於不亡、祗有憑自己的力量、憑自己的勇敢、這時候是我們効力於國家的良機、」</p>
<p>一千幾百個沉毅而果敢的青年、長蛇似地排列在校道、精神地等候那出發的時間到來、用功的學生們都已離開了圖書館、嬌弱的女同學們也已越出了宮門、一切的安逸與享樂再不會出没於每個人的腦袋、倭寇的猙獰的獸臉凶暴的酷行、彷彿展映在眼前、</p>

<p>走出了淞鎭的我們、一羣十五人激昻地沿着崎嶇的狹徑走向緊藏在綠蔭中的農村、</p>

<p>我們從今日起决心從事於救國的工作、不畏難、不怕死、願犧牲一切以赴國難、蠲除利己之心、革除賴人之性、當團結一致以謀國是、如有違背誓言行爲、應爲國人共棄以ＸＸ大學第ＸＸ宣傳隊全體隊員謹誓、二十年九月二十五日」</p>
<p>數分鐘後、我們已四散在全村、開始我們的宣傳工作了、</p>
<p>日本人的殘暴的印象、自從五四運、動以後永遠深注在全民族的心裏、當我們報告了我們所以來演講的動機後、農人們異口同聲的説、「什麽、又是東洋人（俗呼日本人爲東洋人）來欺侮我們中國人麽、倭奴、可惡的倭奴、」這様一羣一羣的農民都放下了他們的工作、來靜聽我們的演講了、</p>
<p>芳講的非常的激昻、非常的懇切、非常的悲憤、農人們聽着他動人的講辭、不時地都低説着「這位女先生講的很對、我們應該不買東洋貨（日本貨）、我們應該加入軍隊、媽的、不殺東洋人我們再也不能安穩地吃飯了、」</p>
<p>「女先生、那末日本人旣是那様的没理、那様的兇惡、我們爲什麽不和他們開戰呢、」一個農民搶着問芳、許多的面孔緊逼着她、好像都盼待着解决這個疑團、　　「這個原因、我們也不十分地明白政府的用意、不過最大的原因、大概軍械的太壞不能和日本一戰罷、現在我們已經在督促政準備開戰了、假使日本兵再不肯撤退、那末想來終有戰事的發生呢、」　　「媽的、等着開戰、我們大家起來、去和倭子一打、看誰的力量大、」</p>
<p>「先生、我們也可以加入軍隊去打東洋人麽、」紛紛的話聲、蓬勃着熱烈的愛國之火燄</p>
<p>「可以的、不久就要組織救國義勇軍了、那便是歡迎你們去參加的、你們如有願意犧牲了生命而去救國的、那末儘可以去報名、加入受軍事的訓練、於必要時便得開赴前線、和敵人們打一個你死我活呢、</p>
<p>當我們的初進村莊時、所看到的祇是異常的平靜、在國難方殷的時候、熱身奔騰着的我們看去、眞是感到也死寂的可憐、似乎糢糊地感到人心已死國事不可爲的悲哀、然而、經過了我們的一番講述、農民們那種熱烈的血氣的激昻的勇敢的精神表現後、才使我們突然的興奮了、雖則在上者是麻木不仁、但民衆們的心還在活躍、國運想還不至於埀絶罷、　　兩個鐘點後、我們便在悲壯的送行之中離開了可愛的有爲的農人們、</p>
<p>另外、我們又找到了一個村莊、自然一切的情狀和前一個村裏的一般、我不禁這様地的感歎説、「救國的祇有這一般純樸的農民、可惜没有給他們有充分的敎育修養、使他們陷於智識的飢荒、」同隊的都同情我的話、普及民衆敎育使我們更相信是持久的救國方法中之一條、　　歸途、黑暗籠罩了蒼茫的薄暮、秋風的緊張中、我們終於遭受了一陣暴雨的打擊、濕的衣服逼着體膚、十分的難堪、但是想到給槍彈砲火掃射過的東省同胞時、心中便釋然了、</p>
<p>「未來的時日、是砲火與炸彈、這區區風雨的打擊算得什麽呢、」顏的旗袍被雨浸透了緊裏着肉體、巔簸地䟦踄於泥濘中、豪放地説、</p>
<h3>宣傳與阿Q時代</h3>
<p>— 君良</p>
<p>當暴日冒大不韙進兵東三省强佔我們國土的消息從新聞紙上傳到我們校裏時、正時清晨陽光糢糊地照在校中東北隅體育館的旗桿上、同學們收歛了平時的笑容、腦裏起伏着哀痛和憤懣的思潮、同學們的血沸騰起來了、</p>
<p>翌日的上午、操塲上站滿了同學、在往時也許游藝會能引誘着這許人、主席宣稱、「今天如果有」同學不出席、我們寗願不開會、接着一陣掌聲、終於會開了、</p>
<p>在酷日之下、我們痛哭流涙的演講</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>者和屏氣靜聽的同學、蒸熱得面紅耳赤、　　幾天的討論同開會、結果是出外宣傳、從前的舊文章、文章雖舊、或許對於麻木不仁的中國民衆、有些兒效力、我們最初抱着這種希望、</p>
<p>我們的一隊、被派在上海東北的一小鎭、離文化中心區上海不算遠、目的地到了、我們便實行宜傳、發傳單、演講、百姓們在小橋晚下的市梢頭、我們站定了、鄕村孩童首先引起了好奇心、他們要傳單、聚的人不算少、我們開始演講、他們都鬼鬼祟祟、似乎怕我們、臉上起了稀有的驚愕的神色、</p>
<p>「···日本現在來殺我們同胞了、」演講者大聲呌喊、</p>
<p>「日本人···」一個老者把眉頭皺一皺、低低的在一個比較年輕的中年人耳邊説一聲、</p>
<p>「洋劊子、」中年人很不耐煩地回答他、</p>
<p>「東洋人丨倭奴···我們不要買東洋貨」演講者聲音提得很高、</p>
<p>「哦、東洋人、」老者和中年人都表示明白了、</p>
<p>「你們有不懂的地方、儘可以問、」當演講者把目光射到老者面上、他就急急地返身走了、中年人同許多小孩和婦女也都默然、雨絲絲地下着、他們漸漸散去、我們也就走了、</p>
<p>到了熱閙市面、我們在比較人多的地方演講、講的人很誠懇、聽的人也都眼光射在别處、而點頭表示懂得的意思、忽然一個長臉大漢用着藐視的神情説、　　「東洋人只會打中國人、因爲我們嘴講不動、老實説、東洋人到這里來、我們二人拼一人、把他們撕來吃了、你們嘴説有什麽用、」他説後目光注視着天空、似乎眞的看見二人把一人撕來吃了、　　「你的話不錯、可是民衆有許多還不知東洋人殺上大門來呢、」</p>
<p>「我很明白······其實、上海各種洋劊子都有、不會放東洋人進來、我們好放心了、」他眼珠向四面一望、以爲這是他最高的見解、</p>
<p>最後我們到了鎭上輿論代表地丨茶館、裏面茶客差不多滿了、我們在一個和尙頭的老者的桌子邊開始演講、那和尙頭生着一臉横肉、嘴角邊埀下二行鬍鬚、我們講演時、和尙頭不住掀重着他的厚的嘴唇、要想説話、終於我們説話告一段落、他開口、</p>
<p>「我們鄕下人穿的自己老布、吃的黃米飯、不要説東洋貨、連西洋貨都不用、」他説時望着我們的衣服、像是説、「你們看看自己罷、」我們啞然、</p>
<p>「你們駡東洋人、但是梳的東洋頭我們鄕下人不是有辮子、便剃和尙頭、哈哈、梳東洋頭駡東洋人、」和尙頭摸着鬍子露出了臘黃的牙齒笑了出來、於是全茶館的人都笑了、</p>
<p>雨又下了、雨點從茶館東北隅送進來、茶客紛紛搬動、我們乘着混亂披着雨衣離了茶館、</p>
<p>在凄風慘雨的暮色裏、我們走出了這小鎭、還彷彿聽見剌耳的笑聲、</p>

<p>(Beiping) Jin County Telegram, 8th: (1) At 1:00 PM on the 8th, 12 Japanese aircraft came from Yingkou to Jinzhou and dropped 36 bombs, landing near the station and Jiaotong University. Casualties are unknown. Long-distance lines were bombed and are currently being repaired.

<p>(Beiping) The most alarming incident since the Japanese army occupied Shenyang on September 19th occurred this afternoon when Japanese aircraft bombed Jinzhou with bombs. Jinzhou is the temporary location of the government of the three eastern provinces. This news was telegraphed by the British superintendent of the Beining Railway, Thomson, to Zhang Xueliang. It is claimed that a squadron of 12 Japanese aircraft carried out the attack, lasting for one hour and fifteen minutes, starting from 1:00 PM. A total of 36 bombs were dropped, and the target of the attack was mostly Jinzhou University, as the school buildings are currently being used as office space for the Liaoning government. When he sent the telegram, the number of deaths and injuries was unknown, but it was known that a bomb hit a service car, killing two cleaners. The locomotive yard was also bombed. Telegraphic communication between Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou has now been cut off. According to the Shenyang telegram from the Japanese-Japanese News transmitted by Tokyo Reuters, the bombing was carried out according to a pre-arranged plan. According to this telegram, the Japanese army in Manchuria bombed Jinzhou because the Zhang Xueliang government was located there, which was not conducive to peace and order. Tokyo observers believe that the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou is too far removed from the Japanese government's claims, hindering the Japanese government's position, and it is expected that the cabinet will resign. According to news obtained by Reuters in Tianjin, many people were killed in the Jinzhou battle, and a German professor was also killed. The station was destroyed by bombs and machine guns. It is reported that seven Chinese people were killed and ten injured, but the exact number is still unknown. The people of Jinzhou were greatly frightened by the bombing.</p>
<p>According to Thomson, he was the first person to report on the Japanese soldiers attacking Jinzhou. When Japanese aircraft bombed the No. 102 train on the Beining Railway on September 24, Thomson was also one of the passengers. He witnessed the Japanese aircraft bombing and saw at least one victim's body. Therefore, Thomson has witnessed the Japanese attack twice. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Recent Situation in Shenyang</h3>

The Shenyang Chamber of Commerce has been established, with Wu Tongxuan as the general manager and Li Futang as the co-manager. (3) All major stores in Shenyang have opened under Japanese pressure. All official businesses have been completely sealed off and are guarded by the Japanese army. The League of Nations countries are paying close attention to the Japanese army's withdrawal of troops before the 14th. Japan does not want to give up its acquired rights, but is afraid of offending public anger. It is heard that there will be further conspiracies. There will be major riots in the Northeast before the 14th, using the excuse to postpone the withdrawal of troops. This matter is brewing. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liaoning Public Security Association Proclamation</h3>
<p>To be Dissolved as Soon as Local Peace is Restored</p>
<p>Yuan Jinkai Expresses a Passive Attitude</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Liaoning Public Security Maintenance Association, due to Japanese propaganda, will establish a neutral country on the 7th and issued the following proclamation: Since the incident in Liaoning, the military and police have fled, government offices have ceased operation, businesses have closed, finance has stagnated, and bandits have taken the opportunity to rise up, causing panic and displacement. There is a sense of imminent danger. How are the innocent people to rely on anything? We could not bear to stand idly by. As a last resort, local gentry organized a local maintenance committee and invited Zhao Xinbo, president of the Legal Research Association, to act as liaison. They are purely gentry and reluctantly maintain order. A self-defense police force has been established to protect merchants and civilians, resist bandits, restore commercial circulation and finance, and provide relief to unemployed workers and send them back home. Although the situation has not fully returned to its former state, it has somewhat calmed the people and reduced suffering. Their actions have their own limits and do not constitute a separate government or a declaration of independence. It is merely a temporary measure of relief. We hope for the understanding of all parties. Once the situation is resolved, someone is responsible, local peace is restored, and there is no panic, it will be dissolved in the near future. This is the humble intention of our colleagues. We are sincerely afraid that distant rumors may cause misunderstandings, so we hereby clarify. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Yuan Jinkai is quite passive due to the appeal of the Beiping-Tianjin Party Department to the Central Government for investigation. He said to others that he is only maintaining public security and does not care about external criticism or praise. His behavior is clear, and he has a clear conscience, and will leave it to public opinion in the future. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

Then, Navy Minister Ambo reported on the deteriorating anti-Japanese situation in Shanghai. It was decided that on the day the protest note was issued, the warships "Tokiwa" and "Tenryu" would be dispatched simultaneously, carrying 400 marines, rushing to Shanghai. (8th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Manchurian Incident, the opinions of the government and the military have been completely inconsistent, and the consequences are worrisome from an international relations perspective. Prime Minister Wakatsuki met with Minister of the Interior Makino and Grand Chamberlain Suzuki yesterday to state his opinions. In the afternoon, he summoned Interior Minister Adachi and Foreign Minister Kihara to discuss measures to eliminate misunderstandings with the military. On the one hand, the government sought understanding from the Privy Council through the mediation of Minister of the Interior Makino. It is heard that as a result, the opinions of the government, the military, and the Privy Council on the China issue have been completely aligned. (8th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the intensified anti-Japanese incidents in central and southern China, the Japanese government's protest note to the National Government was reported on by Foreign Minister Kihara at the cabinet meeting held at 10:00 AM today and requested approval. After Navy Minister Anbo and others made slight revisions to the wording and one or two other points, it was formally passed and will be delivered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Uemura, the consul in Nanjing, by hand to the Nanjing government today. The content of the protest is in the form of a statement and may be published in a day or two. (8th Dentsu Telegram) (Tokyo) Reuters has learned that the Japanese government will send a strongly worded protest to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs tomorrow, accusing the Chinese government of failing to comply with its request to crack down on organized anti-Japanese movements, and stating that such movements not only violate the letter and spirit of the treaty agreements between the two countries, but also constitute truly hostile behavior, even if not resorting to force. This movement is carried out under the command of the Kuomintang, which cannot be distinguished from the government, and is regarded as national policy. China has failed to abide by the promise made in Geneva not to exacerbate the situation. Therefore, if the anti-Japanese movement is allowed to spread further, the Chinese government must bear the responsibility for any damage to the lives and property of Japanese people.

<p>US Government</p>
<h3>Sends Personnel to Inspect Liaoning and Jilin</h3>
<p>China and Japan Both Express Agreement</p>
<p>(Washington) The US State Department announced today that Secretary of State Stimson has sent Hanson, the Consul General in Harbin, and Castleberry, the counselor of the Embassy in Japan, to inspect Liaoning and Jilin, and to secretly report the truth in the Japanese-occupied areas, paying special attention to the Japanese army's withdrawal. According to Undersecretary of State Kessel, Stimson, due to the lack of detailed information about the past and present situation of the Manchurian Incident, specially requested the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors on the 28th of last month to allow the United States to send personnel to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The two governments both expressed their agreement, and they immediately ordered Hansa and others to go. The two are now in Manchuria for two days. However, this investigation is only for the US government's policy decisions and does not judge who is right or wrong, nor is it used to mediate between the two countries.

<p>Shi Zhaoji</p>
<h3>Continues to Report Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the chief representative of China, today also notified the Council of the League of Nations and attached a letter from the commander of the Japanese army in Shenyang, in which the letter stated that the Japanese army's confiscation of Chinese military aircraft in accordance with Article 55 of the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare was legitimate behavior. Since the Japanese army cited the wartime convention, Manchuria was of course in a state of war. In addition, Dr. Shi also reported to the Council that the Japanese army sent one aircraft to scout Harbin, two aircraft to drop bombs on Tongliao, and also occupied the telegraph room and machinery of the Huanggu Tun station on the Beining Railway. There were also 100 infantry, artillery, and cavalry who suddenly transferred from Xinmin to the Julu River. Another train was dispatched carrying 20 soldiers and 20 scouts to Xinmin. In addition, the Japanese armored train drove from Liaoyuan to Tongliao. At the same time, aircraft were sent to drop three bombs there. There was also a train carrying weapons, ammunition, and soldiers that drove to Taonan. Dr. Shi has now reported all the information he has received to the Council for discussion at the meeting on the 14th. (7th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese representative submitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations the telegrams from Nanjing received up to October 4, reporting on the actions of the Japanese army in Manchuria and the Japanese aircraft dropping bombs and bombing Tongliao, and also reporting on the appointment of senior Chinese military officers to take over the areas to be withdrawn by the Japanese troops and to be responsible for restoring order. In general, the situation in Manchuria does not seem to have changed. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Rectifying the Name of "Man Meng"</h3>
<p>The Japanese plan for our Northeast. The scheming is meticulous. Even in the smallest details, they use all their efforts to benefit themselves. For example, their calling our Northeast "Man Meng" is one proof.</p>
<p>The Japanese have a total of 234 regular publications in our Northeast (according to the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association). There are more than 400 specialized books. In every Japanese book and newspaper about our Northeast, the terms "Man Meng", "South Manchuria", "North Manchuria", "Kwantung Leased Territory", and "Attached Lands" are everywhere. Our people do not realize this and follow suit. When talking about the Northeast issue, they do not use its inherent name, but also call it the "Man Meng Issue" or "Attached Lands", and even casually use it in foreign documents. A loss of words is of great importance. International views are often confused because of this. Our people should pay attention to this very subtle point. Don't fall into the Japanese trap without realizing it.</p>
<p>What we call "Northeast" today actually includes the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol. Because it is located in the northeast, it is called "Northeast." "Man Meng" and "Manchuria" are historical names from our past and should not be used. Moreover, there is no reason to combine the scope of the Northeast with Inner Mongolia into one term and call it "Man Meng" and treat it as a special region. "North Manchuria" is the northern part of our Northeast, and "South Manchuria" is the southern part of our Northeast. As for "Kwantung Leased Territory", it is our Liaoning Peninsula or Quanxian. "Attached Lands" refers to the "leased land" on both sides of the South Manchuria Railway. All these terms, from their surface, may seem unimportant, but they are followed and accumulated and become what is right. Forgetting our ancestors, we may not even know in our minds that "Man Meng" is our Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol, and we may not know that it is our territory. The so-called "Man Meng" seems to be divided from our country into an independent special region. The Japanese intention is in this, which is to confuse the international community and make them recognize our Northeast as their "special rights area", and to blur the consciousness of the people of our country, so that they tacitly recognize the Northeast as a special tribe. For example, in the Northeast books written by our own people published in the market, there are so-called "Man Meng under the competition of China, Japan, and Russia" and "Man Meng under international competition." This one sentence is enough to make our territorial sovereignty disappear invisibly. Japanese Yano studied our history and geography, far-fetchedly attached and publicly published a thesis in the Imperial University that the Northeast was not our territory. Since the publication of this article, the Japanese have responded more loudly, making a strong case. Tanaka Giichi once said, "Because Dr. Yano's publication is justified, Chinese scholars have not opposed the theory of our Imperial University. Unfortunately, during the Russo-Japanese War, our country's declaration of war clearly recognized Man Meng as Chinese territory. Also, at the Washington Conference, the Nine-Power Treaty also recognized Man Meng as Chinese territory. Therefore, in diplomacy, we have no choice but to recognize China as a sovereign country. These two miscalculations have caused harm to our empire's rights and interests in Man Meng." The Japanese conspiracy and ambition are fully exposed here. Not only that, the Japanese are even more determined to publicly declare that they have a legitimate relationship with our Northeast. They regard the two wars between China and Japan and Russia and Japan as the facts of their modern demarcation. They also said that they have paid "blood tax" in our Northeast, so they should enjoy special rights. They also said that it is their country's responsibility to develop the Northeast, and even said that if our Northeast cannot be moved to the Atlantic Ocean or sunk into the Pacific Ocean, even if God starts a struggle, the Japanese will never let go. Their arrogance and unreasonableness are truly unparalleled.</p>
<p>Now the cry of "Independence of the Man Meng Kingdom" is already rampant. Who is the instigator and director? Who is the one who is promoting it secretly? Everyone knows that their decades of calling our Northeast "Man Meng" is the basis for today's facts. The Japanese plan for our Northeast is truly like mercury flowing into the ground, entering everywhere. Every word and action has its own intention. Our people should pay attention to this. People all over the world should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Therefore, from now on, our people should resolutely abandon the Japanese pseudo-names such as "Man Meng", "North Manchuria", "South Manchuria", "Kwantung Leased Territory", and "Attached Lands", and no longer use them, so as to rectify the world's views and break the Japanese conspiracy.

<p>Brüning</p>
<h3>Ordered to Form New Cabinet</h3>
<p>The German People No Longer Have Freedom</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 7th: Brüning, at the request of President Hindenburg, is currently organizing a list of new cabinet members, which may be completed tomorrow, so that the new government can be realized within 24 hours after the resignation of the old government. It is generally expected that Brüning will also serve as Foreign Minister himself to show that Germany will not change its foreign policy. However, there are many doubts about the lifespan of the cabinet. If the National People's Party and the United National Rights Party vote against the new government, its lifespan will come to an end. In that case, Brüning must obtain the consent of President Hindenburg to openly declare a dictatorship to govern the country without the need for parliament. Otherwise, Hitler's followers will have the opportunity to take charge of state affairs. Ordinary Germans may not vehemently oppose a dictatorship, because the recent emergency orders have already been equivalent to a dictatorship. The latest order issued today still reduces civil rights, so it can be said that there is no longer freedom of the people in Germany today.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th: Dr. Brüning is currently doing his best to handle government affairs as usual. The new cabinet will be formed at the earliest tomorrow night, because not all of the people Brüning wants to recruit into the cabinet are in Nanjing. The people Brüning is looking for, such as Ambassador to the UK Neu and former Defense Minister Gessler, are still on their way. The situation will only be clear after they arrive in Nanjing tomorrow morning and meet with Brüning. Neu is the most popular candidate for Foreign Minister. If he is unwilling to accept the position, Brüning may temporarily serve as Foreign Minister himself. Gessler is expected to be the Minister of Interior. Schmitz is designated to be the Minister of Communications. The three, in addition to being conservative, have no party affiliation and will join the cabinet as experts. The other two experts are the current permanent Vice-Minister of Justice Gurl, who is expected to be promoted to Minister, and former Prussian Cabinet Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hua Hede, who will be the Minister of Economy. It is reported that the two have agreed to join Brüning's new cabinet. The old cabinet members who will continue to serve are Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Heier, Minister of Finance Dietrel, Minister of Defense Groener, and Minister of Posts Schätzel. Brüning hopes that the reorganized cabinet can obtain the support of a majority in parliament, but because the Social Democratic Party does not unanimously support Brüning, success or failure is still uncertain. Political circles denied last night that the emergency order had dictatorial characteristics, but all circles expressed dissatisfaction with it.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>Starts Election Campaign</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th: British Prime Minister MacDonald has issued a declaration, starting his election campaign. The declaration outlines the organization and work of the National Government, and continues to say that danger remains, and the most important methods should be adopted both internally and externally to balance the budget and restore credit. He also said that the National Government must participate in international conferences to discuss the world's economic and financial situation, and use its power to remove commercial and financial obstacles. These obstacles are the uneconomical distribution of war debts and reparations, and the stagnation of debts. It is difficult to determine the strategies to deal with the situation. The government must consider its own proposals based on the circumstances, such as tax cuts, import reductions, commercial agreements, and mutual economic arrangements for overseas autonomous territories. The remedies required by the situation cannot be implemented by parties that only engage in partisan disputes, but must be implemented through the voluntary cooperation of all parties. Therefore, elections cannot be avoided. Please support the National Government so that the world can see the determination of the British people to support any plan that can restore credit with one heart and one mind in the face of national difficulties. Conservative Party Bauer and Liberal Party Samuel will both issue declarations tomorrow calling on the British people to support the National Government. About 50 members of the Parliamentary Labour Party have now formed the National Labour Party to support MacDonald.</p>

<h3>Meeting of British and French Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>Issues of Disarmament and World Crisis</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 7th: No communiqué was issued on the talks between British Foreign Secretary Reading and French Foreign Minister Briand, but it is understood that they proceeded smoothly. Reading speaks French very fluently, so there was no interpreter present during the talks between the British and French Foreign Ministers. The content of the talks has not been revealed, but it is understood that the two Foreign Ministers discussed issues of disarmament and the world crisis. The talks were mostly in the nature of reports, so there were no concrete results. Regarding the issue of disarmament, it is rumored that Reading is currently making a final effort to reconcile France and Italy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th: According to political circles, British Foreign Secretary Reading said that the British government intends to stabilize the pound as soon as possible after the general election. It is rumored that the French government has agreed to do its best to help the British government achieve this goal. Today, after British Foreign Secretary Reading, French Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Briand, Finance Minister Flandin, and Commerce Minister Rollin held talks, a communiqué stated that the leaders of the two countries sincerely exchanged opinions on various matters related to the overall situation. Talks will continue at 11:00 AM on Thursday.</p>
<p>US Bankers Association Agrees</p>
<h3>Organizing a Lending Institution</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th. President Hoover's proposal to organize a lending institution has had a positive impact in banking circles. Members of the New York Clearing House have agreed to contribute $150 million towards the capital of a $500 million lending institution. Leading bankers say the plan is expected to be finalized by the end of this week. The American Bankers Association, meeting in Atlantic City, has endorsed the proposal to organize a lending institution. President Hoover's proposed lending institution at the White House yesterday aims to expand the facilities provided by the Farm Board and the discount provisions of the Federal Reserve Act, in order to reverse the current global economic panic. President Hoover, after consulting with Treasury officials, Federal Reserve governors, and representatives from both houses of Congress, issued a statement saying that major banks are now initiating the organization of a $500 million lending institution, which, if necessary, can be the same as the wartime financial institutions of the past, with the government providing sufficient funding to meet its legitimate needs. This morning, another important meeting was held at the White House in Washington to discuss the proposal to organize a central mortgage and discount bank.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 8th. The Governor of the Bank of Japan, Tsuchifang, criticized President Hoover's proposal to improve the U.S. economic situation, saying that he does not believe the current state of decline can be easily cured.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Russian-German Dispute</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th. The Russian-German Arbitration Committee held its final meeting today and signed an agreement, thus resolving all outstanding issues between Russia and Germany. The committee was established after the restoration of the Russian-German Treaty last July. Among the outstanding issues resolved today, the status of representatives such as German commercial experts in Russia and the responsibilities of contracts concluded by the Russian Commercial Commission in Berlin were clearly defined.</p>
<h3>Mr. Bittman's Speech on the Silver Question</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 7th. Senator Bittman gave a speech on the radio tonight, broadcast nationwide, claiming that if an international silver conference is convened and agrees to stop dumping silver, the price of silver will immediately double, returning to 60 cents per ounce. At that time, it would greatly increase foreign trade between China and Mexico. He also said that if a silver conference is not convened and there is no immediate remedy for the price of silver, the danger of Britain's isolation in world trade will certainly be realized. It is reported that Bittman, along with Bola and Smote, are leaders of the silver faction in the Senate. Bittman is a Democrat, while Bola and Shi are Republicans. Reuters, Washington, 8th. Representatives attending the Pacific Business Conference met today and advocated convening an international conference to study the restoration of silver prices.</p>
<h3>The Indian Round Table Conference Remains Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th. The work of the Indian Round Table Conference has stalled because Hindus, Muslims, and other minorities have been unable to agree on the number of seats in the Indian parliament. Subsequently, twenty Indian members of the Round Table Conference formed a committee, chaired by Gandhi, to mediate. After a week, at the final meeting tonight, Gandhi admitted that all efforts had been unsuccessful.</p>

<h3>Manchurian Incident</h3>
<p>First Verbal Battle Between China and Japan</p>
<p>At the Council of the League of Nations on the Afternoon of the 19th</p>
<p>The Japanese Representative, Aware of Their Wrongdoing, Made Excuses and Cover-Ups</p>
<p>Our Side Only Made a Simple Statement Due to Not Receiving Detailed Reports</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Geneva: Japan took advantage of our country's unpreparedness, attacked Manchuria at night, invaded our country's sovereignty, and violated international conventions. Japan should bear full responsibility. However, the Japanese are cunning by nature and do not hesitate to fabricate facts and spread all kinds of rumors internationally to cover up the eyes and ears of the world, saying that this war was a legitimate defense on the part of Japan because the Chinese army demolished the South Manchurian Railway. When the Japanese army came forward to stop them, the Chinese soldiers refused to listen and instead opened fire. The Japanese soldiers had no choice but to return fire. Therefore, the Japanese army's attack on China was out of self-defense. Those familiar with the situation in our country will naturally know the inside story of the Japanese wording, but those who are not familiar with the situation will find it difficult to understand the truth. Therefore, people from all countries hope that both China and Japan will make factual statements in order to clarify the truth. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, the Council of the League of Nations met. Our country's representative took office as a member of the Executive Committee and discussed major international issues at the same time. Everyone believed that the Chinese and Japanese representatives would inevitably engage in a fierce confrontation, each defending their own country, in order to awaken the ears and eyes of the world. Therefore, the audience attending the meeting that day was packed. The meeting began at 5:00 p.m. The Japanese representative (Ambassador to Paris) was the first to stand up and speak. His speech was as follows: "Mr. Chairman, according to newspaper reports, an accident occurred near Shenyang last night. I would very much like to report the first news I received to the Council, and I am grateful for your permission. Unfortunately, this news is not very detailed. What I can tell you is that Chinese and Japanese troops have clashed in Shenyang and near the South Manchurian Railway. Since hearing this news, the Japanese government has taken all possible measures to prevent this local incident from escalating. I have now asked my government for detailed information. I am confident that it will do its utmost to calm the matter."</p>
<p>The Japanese representative knew yesterday that this act of his country trampled on international conventions and destroyed world peace, which was intolerable to righteousness. Therefore, he tried his best to minimize the problem and make this cunning cover-up. From these few words, his embarrassment can be seen. Our country is justified, and many opinions from all parties also support us. Moreover, our country was recently elected as a member of the Executive Committee, and we can take advantage of the opportunity to inform the world of the source of Japan's invasion of our country in the form of a report. However, at that time, our country's representative, Shi Zhaoji, had not yet received a detailed report from the country, and the truth was not clear. Therefore, his first statement was very cautious and only made the following statement: "Mr. Chairman, since the news of the accident in Manzhouli came (that is, what the Japanese representative just stated), I have been deeply disturbed after hearing it. According to the report I have received so far, China does not seem to have taken any action that would cause this accident. If I receive official news about this unfortunate incident in the future, I will report it to the Council." After our country's representative spoke, the acting chairman of the Council, Lai Ru Leroux (Spanish Foreign Minister), stood up and said, "We have heard the statements of the Chinese and Japanese representatives. The Council is very pleased to hear that the Japanese government will take necessary measures to ease this situation. It goes without saying that I and all the members present sincerely hope that this issue can be resolved as soon as possible." After the chairman finished speaking, other issues were discussed. Japan deliberately invaded China, disregarded the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and despised the provisions of Article 12 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. However, the League of Nations, which claims to maintain world peace, only concluded it with the words "sincerely hope that this issue can be resolved as soon as possible." Those who heard this were disappointed. The current session of the League of Nations was discussing disarmament when Japan suddenly risked the world's great disapproval and attacked China. People here heard this like a bolt from the blue. If the Executive Council does not come out to interfere and make fair sanctions, and allows the common enemy of mankind to roam free, the future of international peace is especially bleak. (Morning of the 20th)</p>
<h3>Liaoning and Jilin</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Has No Intention of Withdrawing</p>
<p>Correspondence from Jin County: Since the League of Nations proposed that Japan withdraw its troops, the Japanese side has vigorously promoted that all Japanese troops stationed in various parts of Liaoning have been withdrawn to the South Manchurian Railway line. In fact, this is just a publicity stunt. As of now, not a single soldier has actually withdrawn from the fortresses in China that they occupy. The following is a summary of the actions after Japan declared its withdrawal, in order to show that Japan's conspiracy is in full swing.</p>
<p>Actively Preparing to Permanently Occupy Liaoning City: Heavy troops are still stationed in Liaoning City, and defensive works are actively being prepared near the North Gate and East Gate. Furthermore, trenches are being built at the Juliuhe Station along the Beining Road, and considerable troops are deployed there. Also, on the evening of October 2, a large number of Japanese troops took two armored trains and, under the pretext of suppressing bandits, passed through Baqibao, west of Xinmin, and seemed to be advancing westward. In addition, Japan occupied Liaoyuan with a large force and established a large-scale airfield nearby, where it repainted all the Chinese aircraft seized in Shenyang and transported them there for the purpose of bombing cities in eastern Liaoning and attacking trains. Although Japan has declared to the international community that it will withdraw its troops immediately, it is actually preparing for a long-term occupation at all times and in all places. Who would believe the so-called withdrawal?</p>
<p>Theft Cases Occur Repeatedly and Are Ignored: Since the provincial capital was occupied by the Japanese army, the Japanese have used cruel methods to treat our people. First, they let their soldiers plunder and rape, and then they incited Korean and Japanese ruffians to rob everywhere. They also set fire to and destroyed the Public Security Bureau, which maintained local order. In addition, on the 21st of last month, the Northeast Grain</p>
<p>Also, the electric force factory and the public bus factory were occupied, and all employees were expelled. Moreover, theft cases have occurred repeatedly in recent days, and the Japanese army has ignored them. As a result, the citizens are in a state of panic all day long, and businesses have not yet resumed operations.</p>
<p>Releasing Prisoners and Disrupting Order: In addition to the above, the Japanese are also using conspiracies everywhere to disrupt the order of our society. For example, whenever the Japanese army occupies a Chinese county town, it releases the prisoners in the prison, selecting those who have committed the most heinous crimes first. The purpose is to use these desperate people to disrupt local security and shake the Chinese regime. As for those who were imprisoned for crimes such as Ji Gong's selling of national land, not only are they released first, but they are also immediately used as their pawns. Although Japan has stated that it has not released prisoners, the facts are all there, and it cannot be allowed to quibble.</p>
<p>Forcibly Buying Grain with Feng Piao: In addition to releasing prisoners, Japan has recently been using large amounts of Feng Piao to buy grain in various places along the South Manchurian Railway, Shenhai Railway, Jichang Railway, and Jidun Railway. If the Chinese people are unwilling to sell, Japan will use threats and force to compel them. Under their tyranny, the Chinese people have no choice but to obey. As a result, all the new grain harvested in Northeast China this year has been bought by the Japanese. In the future, the Japanese plan to circulate gold notes in the market to completely defeat Feng Piao, in order to trap the people of Northeast China in a desperate situation. Their intention can be described as malicious.</p>
<p>Forcibly Building the Ji-Hui Railway: What is most alarming to us is that Japan is forcibly building the Ji-Hui Railway and using it to plunder Chinese territory. According to recent visitors from Jilin, after Japan occupied Yanji, it immediately forced Chinese farmers and workers to work day and night, actively carrying out construction. It is estimated that the Ji-Hui Railway will be completed in half a month. The Chinese people there are killed miserably if they do not obey their orders. Japan also intends to expel all the Chinese residents along the Ji-Hui Railway on the day of its completion, and then move in a large number of Koreans to carry out reclamation, turning the area into a Japanese colony. If our country's authorities do not find a way to stop it, I am afraid that the land along the Ji-Hui Railway will no longer be ours in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Li Yi Shamelessly Takes Office: In recent days, there have been organizations of civil maintenance associations in the cities of Liaoning and Jilin. Among them, there are certainly people who aim to maintain local security, but there are also many people who, under the coercion and instigation of the Japanese, rise up to act as accomplices. For example, Yuan Jinkai, Yu Chonghan, and others recently organized a local security maintenance committee in Shenyang, and Xi Qia and others organized an autonomous government in Jilin. These were purely instigated by the Japanese. The reason why Japan does this is nothing more than to use the old tricks of annexing Korea to annex our China. However, some people in our country are actually willing to be Li Wanyong, shamelessly taking pleasure in it. This is truly a great shame for our nation. However, although Yuan and others were instructed by the Japanese, they have not yet been formally appointed by the Japanese. However, it is unexpected that recently, Li Yi was formally appointed by the Japanese pseudo-Shenyang Mayor Doihara as the Director of the Shenyang Civil Affairs Office. Li Yi was originally the magistrate of Shenyang County. After Shenyang was occupied, Li was forced out by the Japanese to maintain local security. The Japanese recognized him as capable. Recently, Doihara actually appointed Li as the Director of the Shenyang Civil Affairs Office, and Li actually took office on October 1 in accordance with the order. This kind of demented and shameless act of serving the enemy is even worse than that of Yuan Yu and others. (September 4)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Jilin</h3>
<p>Most Newspapers Have Stopped Publishing</p>
<p>No Schools Are in Session</p>
<p>Correspondence from Jilin: After the Japanese army arrived in Jilin, the Jilin newspaper offices were greatly oppressed. Police Chief Tsuboi informed the newspapers that they must be inspected. The large format must be sent to the headquarters by 3:00 p.m. every day, where Tsuboi would sign it and return it. All military actions and words unfavorable to the Japanese army were not allowed. Only the Jichang Daily, a Chinese newspaper in the provincial capital, was able to publish because the large format was assembled early and there was not enough time. Therefore, only one large sheet was published, and the news only occupied one page. The rest was all advertisements. Most of the news published was not related to the current situation. Therefore, sales were greatly reduced. Foreign newspapers took advantage of the opportunity to expand greatly, and sales soared. This was inevitable. Since the situation changed, all the Chinese newspapers that dared to speak out on weekdays have stopped publishing. Let alone the Shenyang Minbao, the Changchun Dadong Bao was first destroyed for publishing</p>
<p>The extra edition of the incident.</p>
<p>Before the Japanese army entered Jilin, the troops stationed in the province were ordered to withdraw to avoid conflict. The withdrawing troops were also disarmed. Feng Shoushan, the head of the guard regiment of the Border Defense Deputy Commander's Office, was ordered by Xi Qia to relocate when the Japanese army entered Jilin in the morning. The next day, he was ordered to disarm. Feng was very angry and encouraged his subordinates, saying that they would rather die than disarm. He immediately supervised all the troops to go south along the Jihai Road. Later, Japanese aircraft偵察the whereabouts of the army, saying that it had entered the depths of the 甸 County mountains, far from the railway line. The Japanese army could not do anything about it. Feng's unit was numbered 682 regiment, and it was a strong force in Jilin with more than 1,500 people, carrying weapons, military pay, and vehicles, cotton military uniforms, which were very complete. When Xi Qia and the Japanese side discussed the issue of the disarmament of the brigade, Xi said that Feng had disobeyed the order and that he could not execute it. Domon said that Xi was not sincere, and Xi was greatly embarrassed. Later, Domon smoothed things over himself, making Xi responsible for治安全. As a result, the new official system of長官was created.</p>
<p>Japanese military aircraft侦察have not come for three days. The number of Japanese troops has also decreased. It is said that the Japanese claimed 2,700 men, but except for those who went to Dunhua and withdrew to Changchun, currently</p>

<p>Continued Important News</p>
<p>Only a few hundred remain, most of whom live in the station, Hengmao Flour Mill Company, some in the 長官公署, some in the Military and Political Office, and a few in the consulate and the South Manchurian Railway staff quarters. Although there are few Japanese troops, a dozen or so Japanese military police have recently arrived and forcibly live in the 交涉署, writing "Jilin Japanese Military Police Team" and hanging it on the door.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Commander Tsuboi notified the Department of Education and ordered the schools to open, but the students of each school were heartbroken about the national crisis and agreed to strike, so they have not attended classes for many days. The Fifth Middle School and the First Normal School near the Dongjuzi Armory have more no one because there are Japanese troops living in them. Because most of the students from 外县 have returned to their villages, the students in the provincial capital also avoided the Japanese army and dared not go to school.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army arrived, they first occupied the Provincial Party Headquarters and raised the Japanese flag. The Japanese have always hated the Party Headquarters. Party Committee Member Han Jiesheng also served as the Director of the Military Law Trial Office. Many Korean accomplices were interrogated by Mr. Han. The Koreans hated him very much. The day after the Japanese army arrived in Jilin, they arrested Han and have not released him to this day. There are rumors that his life is in danger. The 243 Korean criminals who were arrested and detained in Yandun were released from prison by the Japanese army, and the six anti-Japanese Koreans were all executed. (October 1)</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Protest</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Forcibly Seals Chinese Banks</p>
<p>Demei Evening News, Shenyang (transferred to Shanghai via Japan) on the 7th: After the foreign merchants of British and American and other countries here jointly protested to the Japanese military authorities about the closure of the official Chinese banks, such as Bianye and Dongsansheng Banks, today they received a reply from the Japanese military authorities saying that this move was necessary due to the unrest in the current situation and to protect the banks. The Japanese military authorities had no intention of hindering the rights of depositors and were also eager to reopen the Bianye and Dongsansheng Banks. It is expected that the two banks will be able to reopen soon. Chinese businessmen here said that the Japanese took the opportunity to occupy with force to expand their economic interests, so that they could control South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. In particular, with regard to the railways that have been in dispute for a long time, Kanto Army Commander Honjo claimed today that at 2:00 a.m. this morning, 100 soldiers of the 77th Regiment, carrying 12 field guns, took seven Beining trains to Juliuhe on the Beining Road because more than 1,300 Chinese dispersed soldiers gathered on the right bank of the Liao River north of Xinmin, so Japanese troops were sent to protect the residents. It is reported that these dispersed soldiers seem to be the former Northern Great Camp stationed troops, who are now detouring to Beining Road and plan to take a train to Jinzhou.</p>
<h3>Sun Hongyi Warns the Japanese People</h3>
<p>Sun Hongyi published a letter warning the Japanese people, saying that since the violent and arbitrary Jinan Incident occurred, our country's land, people, lives, and property have been trampled on and destroyed by violence and power. Instead of resorting to arms, we endured humiliation and carried a heavy burden, and fought a desperate battle with your country through economic severance. This kind of tragic impression is deeply engraved in our minds. As for what reputation and benefits your country's iron hooves have gained from纵横, I heard that export trade has been reduced sharply at once, and its impact on your country's entire economy cannot be said to be insignificant. Are there no people with far-sighted plans and deep knowledge in your country who do not feel this? Unexpectedly, the strange drama of adding troops to our Liaoning and Jilin has recently been staged again. Its atrocities are a hundred times worse than the Jinan Incident. Your country stands in the world's international community and has always advertised itself with the rule of law and civilization. Even if our government is overwhelmed by floods and rampant red disaster, and has not had time to work hard on the east, clear foreign affairs, and unresolved cases need to be urged, is there no diplomatic path to follow? But it is necessary to smash international law, international norms, international treaties, etc., with one hand. What is the reason for coming suddenly and cunningly? Liaoning and Jilin are more than a thousand miles away, and the difference in the time of sending troops is only two hours. Even a three-foot child knows that it is a prepared and organized action.</p>
<p>When our local party bureau first questioned the consul who was the plenipotentiary in charge of negotiations, he was not responsible at all and shirked it as beyond his authority. Then, when our central government questioned the plenipotentiary minister and your country's government, they said it was the action of the military. How can the truth in this be concealed from the eyes of the world with one hand? Even if it is true, the military阀橫行,割据地盘,草菅人命, has become a painful history since our country's republic. Our people have been憔悴呻吟 for a long time. 民治尚没有发皇, 统一犹待完立 are all the terrible steps for this remaining special force. This trend is now fortunately declining, and your country's military is actually following the same old path. Your country's great achievements in倒幕, and the維新诸烈 who threw their heads and 骨粉 to obtain them, how magnificent! Today, your country's government cannot載制the weaknesses of the military, and it is露無遺. It is still初張氣燄,浸且</p>
<p>变本加厉. After肆威对外, it turns to 对内争政. How can your country's优秀分子 without guns resist it? It is estimated that they will only be able to결설추상,擾攘不知经过若干岁月, 狮象踢踏,非驴所堪. Your country's military force is stronger than ours, and the harm of being践踏跋扈 受将 will also be crueler than ours. 同文同种，唇齿苦痛,窃为危之.</p>
<p>Next,佳兵不祥,世界通例. Compared with the精强 of your country's navy, army, and air force, who is better than Germany's 維廉第二? Compared with the拓畺之廣 and the树威之远, who is better than France's 拿破崙? Where are those heroes of their time now? In the current situation of equal strength in the world, it is not something that your country's national strength can break. Even if the international organization's督责and the friendly governments'執言have no effect on your country's military behavior. However,联俄 was a quite long history before our government, which has been cancelled even though it was opposed by the people of the country. If it is still too difficult for us and逼之太甚, then emotional衝安知所極. The great powers of the same age are connected by interests, and how can they stand by and watch? The international hostility will become more and more intense, and the war clouds will be弥漫远东. The so-called Second World War will begin there. 禍首推珠，责任所在,实为贵国尸之. Moreover, economic decline and increasing unemployment have become a common trend in the world, and your country has already seen the端倘. Once the 祸结兵连, 生计益蹙,事变纷乘, the victory or defeat on the battlefield is uncertain, and the患已起于萧墙. In the past, external wars were used to stop internal disputes, but now it is difficult to guarantee that external disputes will not cause internal unrest. The German and Russian coups can be used as lessons. Generally speaking, international interests are built on the basis of peace and emotion, so that they can be consolidated and maintained for a long time. If it is necessary to rely on force to强刧豪奪, then circular retaliation will never end, only sowing the evil cause of mutual massacre between the two peoples and creating an extremely terrifying environment in the future. Our country originally planned to open the whole country to the world in order to absorb foreign capital, borrow materials from other places, increase the construction of railways, and develop industries as a predetermined policy, but we hope that friendly countries will abolish the consular jurisdiction and the right to station troops, so that sovereignty can be unified and no complications can arise as a prerequisite. Our country's internal strife has not been settled, and external worries are imminent. Construction projects are still pending. 巴各 friendly countries treat us with equality and independence as early as possible, so that内外宁静 and the朝野 can be calm and trusting in the strength of the government, so that we can concentrate on the work of emerging. If the political situation is clear and all waste is ready, and there are many construction projects, the absorption of capital will be huge, the purchasing power will be strong, the amount of trade will increase, and the construction will be tight, then the employment of materials will be many. All kinds of money, equipment, materials, and talents will call on all friendly countries to shoulder the responsibility. Our country and your country are connected by bad land. In terms of goods, transportation is convenient, manufacturing is light, and the cost is low. In terms of talents, exchanges are frequent, the situation is familiar, the life is simple, and the salary is even cheaper. In terms of the维居, the climate is the same and the neighbors are close. In terms of investment, the investigation is rapid and the news is well-informed. All these natural and artificial positions have advantages. Your country should尽</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Xinzhuang Chamber of Commerce Organizes a Merchant Corps: The Xinzhuang Township Chamber of Commerce in this county, recognizing the urgency of the national crisis and following the telegram from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, convened a special temporary meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 7:00 PM last night (the 7th) to discuss the organization of a merchant corps. The proposal was unanimously approved on the spot. Subsequently, Qian Shixin, Wang Xingsheng, Zhou Menglin, and two others were appointed as organizers responsible for all preparations. The initial funding will be temporarily borrowed from the remaining funds of the security corps and will be repaid after fundraising. Regarding firearms, the chamber of commerce will recall the fast-firing revolvers that it had lent to the fifth sub-station of the township for self-defense. The number of corps members was set at 24, to be recruited by the organizers.</p>
<p>Nine Criminals Executed by Firing Squad: The Songhu Pacification Zone Headquarters repeatedly received reports of the capture of bandits involved in looting incidents in Xincang, Yaqian, Zhu Jing, Xinhuang, Fu Huang, and other places. Yang Azhao, Jin Shunming (aka Jin Dongquan), Song Yaolin, Jin Heshang, Shen Yongshun (aka Shen Ahai), Zhou Quangen, Li Akai, Yu Guihu, and Huang Yougen were found guilty after interrogation. Based on the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, they were all sentenced to death. This was reported to the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office, which approved the execution. Commander Cao, upon receiving the telegram, signed the order to transfer the nine bandits, including Yang Azhao, on the morning of the 7th at 10:00 AM. After verifying their identities, they were bound and taken to the Yuhuangge execution ground and executed by firing squad to serve as a warning. Investigation into the Tang Surname Murder Case: Tang Zhiyao, the owner of the Tang Helong sesame oil shop at Kuatang Bridge outside the west gate of the city, was suddenly killed by a violent intruder at 2:00 AM on the night of September 5th last year. At the time, the prosecutor conducted an examination and found multiple knife wounds, indicating a brutal death. There was widespread suspicion in society that his son, Tang Qiusheng, had instigated the perpetrators. Subsequently, relatives (the deceased's younger brother) Zhigao and others strongly defended him, published an advertisement, and sent a letter to correct the rumors and dispel the misinformation. As the real killer had not been apprehended, the case was shelved. Now, after Shen Shaoqing was arrested and confessed to the murder of Tang, he identified Tang's son, Qiusheng, as the instigator. The court prosecutor's office immediately arrested Tang Qiusheng at 1:00 PM today for interrogation. The security was tight, and the details are unclear. The murderer, Shen Shaoqing, was also brought in for confrontation. It is said that the prosecutor's office will conduct a thorough investigation to reach a verdict.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Bands of Bandits Lurking in Taihu: Recently, banditry has resurged in the countryside of Suzhou, causing widespread panic among the villagers. Yesterday (the 8th), the county government received a report from Xu, the Chief of the Guangfu District Public Security Bureau: (1) Bandits frequently appear in areas along Taihu Lake, including Shanyanggang, Kengkengkou, Yaoshang, Tandong Township, Man, Da, and Xiao Gongshan. (2) The bandit leader Qin Banglin's gang, consisting of about 40 to 50 bandits armed with military weapons, along with gangs from Haizhou, Henan, and Jiangbei, are lurking in Taihu Lake, moving unpredictably. People throughout the lake region are startled multiple times a night. Those with some assets have moved to the city. The stationed police patrol boats are unable to navigate Taihu Lake. As winter defense approaches, preventive measures should be planned in advance. County Magistrate Wu immediately sent a letter to the third water public security district, requesting the allocation of warships for suppression. Villagers in Dongting East Mountain also submitted a request yesterday for the dispatch of troops to defend against bandits.</p>
<p>Financial Department Denies the Retention of Disaster Relief Funds: Various circles in Suzhou had discussed and resolved to levy an additional month's rent from the shops in the urban area starting in September, which would yield approximately 60,000 silver dollars. Half of this amount was to be retained for disaster relief and water conservancy repairs. The County Finance Bureau submitted a report to the Finance Department for record. Yesterday, instructions were received stating that the additional rent levy could proceed as planned, but the retention of half the funds was not approved. Because the provincial construction bonds had already been designated for specific purposes, it would be inappropriate to change them without a resolution from the provincial government, to avoid setting a precedent for other counties. Therefore, the request was denied.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Association Begins Inspection of Japanese Goods: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county, having concluded the registration of Japanese goods at the end of September, began inspecting Japanese goods in the city and its surroundings today (the 6th). The investigators included Zha Zhi Chao, Wu Rong Jian, and Wu Mudi.</p>
<p>County Water Patrol Team Rescues Hostages: Xue Yong, the captain of the county water patrol team, led a team disguised as farmers on the 5th, riding on a civilian boat to suppress bandits in areas such as Shuangmiaogang in Taihu Lake. They encountered bandits, and a firefight ensued for about half an hour. The bandits then escaped by swimming. In addition to killing two bandits on the spot, they rescued Xu Wu, the daughter-in-law of Xu Jinshan from Liuxu Village outside the north gate of the city, her young son Amao, and Lu Hexiang, who had been kidnapped from Hengjing in Wuxian County, along with a boat and several stolen items. After a preliminary interrogation by Captain Xue, the female bandit confessed without denying. She has been transferred to the county for further investigation today.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Standing Committee Requests Tax Reduction from the Provincial Government: The county's business tax is 15,000 yuan per year, which has been approved by the Finance Department for collection on behalf of the county. The chamber of commerce began collecting the tax on August 10th, and the current accounting shows that the annual amount is less than 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, the executive committee resolved to send standing committee member Wu Minyu to the provincial government to request approval for a tax reduction to alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Director of the Construction Bureau Takes Office: Mao Feng, the director of the Construction Bureau of this county, was accused by Wang Jingqing and others last month to the provincial government. The provincial government meeting recently resolved that Director Mao should await further assignment, and the vacant position would be filled by Yao Dixing, a local from this county who previously served as the director of the bureau. After being appointed, Yao arrived at the bureau yesterday (the 8th) to take over the work and is scheduled to be formally sworn in. Meeting on the Amount of Tax Reduction for Disaster-Stricken Fields: The county government of this county, due to the severe disaster situation in various districts this year, with as many as 298,300 mu of fields submerged, convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at Wenxi Hall, bringing together the district chiefs and various departments such as party affairs, politics, public security, finance, and construction, to discuss the amount of tax reduction for the submerged fields and the methods. County Magistrate Chen presided over the meeting, and three key issues were resolved: (1) It was resolved to examine the original reports from each district regarding the submerged fields, totaling 298,300 mu. After deducting 4,000 mu, there are 236,730 mu that are completely barren and 57,569 mu that are partially barren. These fields are calculated based on the actual amount of fertile land, and the land price tax for the entire year will be waived for all completely barren fields. The tax will be reduced by 50% for partially barren fields, with 50% actually collected. All fields that have not reported barrenness will be taxed in full. (2) It was resolved that for the land price tax on barren land that should be exempted this year, some have already cleared the first installment of the land price tax, making it difficult to refund. It has now been decided that the first installment of the 20th year's land price tax will still be collected in full and offset against the first installment of the 21st year's land price tax. (3) It was resolved that in the past, the barren land registers were handled solely by the district grain brokers, which often led to extortion and many malpractices. This time, the investigation and creation of the barren land registers should be strictly supervised by the district and township chiefs. All barren land registers should be reviewed by the district and township chiefs and stamped with the seals of the district and township offices. If any grain bookkeepers are still found to be engaging in fraud or extortion, the district and township chiefs should report them to the county government and the Finance Bureau for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Police Team Captures Bandit and Transfers Him to the County: According to reports, the first squad of the first platoon of the Lao Guqiao police station in the fourth district of Wuyi County learned that a bandit named "One Foot Head" was hiding in Caojiata. They dispatched a team to search and arrested Qi Atu, the brother of "One Foot Head", who was transferred to the team for preliminary interrogation. He confessed without denying that he had conspired to extort money. The team transferred the suspect to the county for investigation on the 7th.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Seizes Japanese Paper: On the 7th, inspectors from the Wuyi County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association seized a large quantity of Japanese paper at Biaochang in Ximen, including four large pieces of Qianshunxing white oil paper and one piece of red oil paper. In addition, there were also many pieces of paper materials from companies such as Tongtaichang, Deyuanchang, and Zhaoxin, which were all impounded and sealed by the Anti-Japanese Association pending disposal.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Entertainment Venues Shut Down Separately: The County Party Affairs Executive Committee held its 14th meeting yesterday to discuss the cessation of entertainment. The resolutions were: (1) A letter should be sent to the Provincial Public Security Bureau to strictly ban Qingchang venues (Chinese opera singing without makeup). (2) Movie theaters should screen patriotic films as much as possible. (3) Storytelling venues should exploit anti-Japanese materials as much as possible. (4) Beijing opera performances should be suspended. (5) A letter should be sent to the Provincial Propaganda Committee not to raise funds through entertainment activities. (6) Public banquets should be stopped.</p>
<h3>Taixian</h3>
<p>Nighttime Scare in Qutang Township: On the night of the 2nd of this month, a motorboat passing through Qutang Township in this county accidentally crashed into the piers of the East Bridge. Subsequently, Liu Jianqing, a committee member of the township chamber of commerce, was publicly elected to go forward to inquire. Unexpectedly, the boat, without asking the details, sent troops ashore, violently beating the person making inquiries and deploying troops along the way to cut off traffic. Order in the whole city was immediately disrupted. Afterwards, it was learned that the boat belonged to Staff Officer Zhu of the Commissioner's Office. The citizens of the township have jointly reported the facts to Commissioner Zhang, requesting that he investigate and handle the matter according to law to maintain his reputation. It is reported that people from Biao County who are in Shanghai also have a serious opinion about this matter.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Specialist in Identification of Japanese Goods Arrives in He: The inspection team of the Jiaxing Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association had previously seized white sugar and various other goods at the wharf, sub-customs, post office, and station. The purchasing merchants had raised objections. The inspection team, for the sake of careful investigation, sent representatives to Shanghai to hire experts to come to He for identification. They have already accompanied Shi Gong (specializing in identifying miscellaneous goods and cloth), Sun Chunshan (specializing in identifying southern goods), and Mei Kaifu (specializing in identifying cloth, etc.), three identification experts dispatched by the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association, to He. On the 7th, they tested the 45 bags of sugar seized at the sub-customs bag by bag, finding 5 bags of Japanese sugar and 10 bags of mixed Chinese-Japanese sugar, with the rest being Taikoo sugar. The various suspected Japanese goods sealed by the county party headquarters have been identified separately since the 8th. The Anti-Japanese Association will also dispatch personnel to jointly seal all registered Japanese goods in the shops with the Public Security Bureau Security Team, starting on the 8th. Any violations will be handled in accordance with the Zhejiang Province Provisional Rules for Punishing Treacherous Merchants Privately Transporting and Selling Japanese Goods.</p>
<p>Various Agencies Conduct Military Training: The entire staff of the Jiaxing County Party Headquarters is implementing military training, which has been implemented since the day before yesterday. Wang Chunong has been hired as the instructor.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Two Families Robbed in One Night: The home of Yin Gongmei outside the east gate was robbed on the night of the 7th. Yin was conducting chanting with monks at 11:00 pm, and seven robbers suddenly broke in with weapons. Yin's family members looked at each other in dismay, not daring to make a sound, allowing them to rummage through the boxes and loot to their hearts' content. The guests attending the memorial service were also affected. Later, they turned to the Yang family in Yangshu Village, forcing them to hand over silver. When Yang refused, they were also robbed in the same way, suffering considerable losses. They calmly left south before dawn.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Zhang Nanxian Enthusiastic about Military Training: The military training for all staff of the Zhejiang Provincial Government has already begun. The departments and offices are compiled into one brigade, divided into three companies. Practical training is held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and academic subjects are held every Tuesday and Thursday. They are working hard to implement the training. They have been practicing footwork in the auditorium for several days, and gun drills will be taught starting next week. Ten staff members of the Finance Department, including the elderly and weak Wei Songtang and Lu Min, were unable to cope and were allowed to retire. However, Chairman Zhang Nanxian, who is already 58 years old, is still vigorous and can be called a model for the whole group. He had already trained to the point of kneeling and preparing to fire on the morning of the day before, kneeling on the ground with the crowd, with great spirit. In addition, there is also an old staff member, Ye Jingren, who is a clerk and is already 68 years old, who also attends every day and does not want to retire.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association Prepares to Organize Volunteer Corps: The case of organizing a volunteer corps by the Shaoxing Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was resolved by the County Party Headquarters yesterday. Together with the county government, they will hold a fundraising meeting for the entire county's gentry and merchants and various agencies on a scheduled basis. On one hand, they will organize a preparatory office for the volunteer corps as soon as possible to solicit members. On the 6th, they gathered all staff members of party and government agencies to discuss methods of military training.</p>
<p>Schedule for Expanded Disguised Propaganda: Shaoxing schools are scheduled to hold expanded disguised anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda in various theaters on October 10th. The expenses are temporarily set at 150 yuan, which will be raised by the Celebration of National Day Preparatory Committee from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Each District Rushes to Organize Voluntary Security Corps: The Shaoxing County Government issued a notice to the heads of each township and district yesterday, stating that at a time when the country is facing multiple problems, with external troubles and internal worries, the development is still in its infancy, and the provincial security team is also concentrating, local security is of utmost importance. In addition to thoroughly reorganizing the existing security corps, they should quickly convene each important or prosperous village and try to organize voluntary security corps, collecting civilian firearms, with at least 20 members or more. They should complete the allocation and deployment within 20 days from the date of arrival of the document and intensify training to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Letter of Reply</p>
<h3>Letter from the Shanghai Transport Industry Association</h3>
<p>Recently, I read in the foreign news section of your newspaper that more than 200 pieces of Japanese goods such as foreign cloth and paper materials were seized in Suzhou, which were transported from Shanghai through Huitong and Dingtong and other transportation companies. They were immediately detained and sealed for reporting to the association, awaiting disposal. I was surprised to read this and made a long-distance telephone inquiry to the Wuxian County Association in Suzhou. It was claimed that the goods transported to Su were inspected by personnel dispatched by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and were found to be non-Japanese goods and were released one by one at that time, and there was no detention. The matter concerns the reputation of each company, and I am deeply afraid of rumors and hearsay. I am specifically writing to request a correction.</p>

<h3>Secret Meeting in Japan to Uphold Rights and Interests in Manchuria and Mongolia</h3>
<p>Summary Translation of Minutes</p>
<p>These secret meeting minutes were secretly sold to a Chinese person by Japanese ronin. Now that the Japanese are taking advantage of our disasters to occupy our Liaoning and Jilin, my close friend and executive committee member of this association, Mr. Wang Dan, who is stationed in Harbin, is concerned that the country will be destroyed at any time, so he quickly sent me these secret meeting minutes. After receiving and reading them, I realized that the time when our country is suffering from natural disasters and man-made disasters is regarded by the Japanese as a God-given opportunity. The current instructions to the restoration faction to carry out nation-building movements in Manchuria and Mongolia, and to urge bandits to endanger railway safety, are all pre-planned. As for their research on the international situation and the means of coercing and inducing our Northeast authorities, they are all extremely insidious and vicious, using the pretext of upholding their vested rights in Manchuria to achieve Japan's ultimate goal (namely, annexing Manchuria and Mongolia to complete its continental policy). Readers should not focus too much on the discussion of railway rights in the content, but should focus on their political intentions. Liu Lumin.</p>
<p>(1) Time: 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on December 7th of last year. (2) Venue: Office of the Minister of Colonial Affairs. (3) Attendees: Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda, President Sengoku, Director Kimura, Foreign Ministry officials Yoshida and Nagai, Vice Ministers of Colonial Affairs Komura and Kosaka, participating military officials, Director of the Treaty Bureau Matsunaga, Director of the Asia Bureau, Vice Minister of the Army of the Military Department, Vice Chief of Staff, and Chief of the First Section. (4) Resolutions: (A) Sent to bring Manchuria and Mongolia's diplomatic power to Nanjing, we will take a lenient approach to the outside and a strict approach to the inside to oppose it. Furthermore, we will take the opportunity to emphasize and force them to still appoint Zhang Xueliang as the chief officer responsible for diplomacy, so that the empire can maintain its special status and privileges. (B) Take an interfering attitude towards the construction of the Feng faction's railway network to prevent its realization, especially by inducing it to coordinate with us through the strategy of forcing war and seeking peace. The restriction on the Manchuria-Mongolia railway freight rates and the cargo absorption area seems to be enough to permanently protect the prosperity of the South Manchuria Railway and Dalian Port. When the God-given opportunity comes, the empire's goals for Manchuria and Mongolia can be achieved.</p>
<p>Director Kimura's explanation of the proposal stated that the maverick Zhang Xueliang is rushing towards us with the momentum of ten thousand horses. He has entrusted Wang Jiazhen with his diplomacy to the south and Gao Jiyi with his railways to the north, working together to smash our special rights in Manchuria and Mongolia in one fell swoop. However, Chiang and Zhang are in the same boat... and there are two factions, new and old, within the Feng faction, who are mutually hostile... According to the efforts of our Army Staff Department to instigate a major collapse within the Feng faction, this is an inevitable certainty that can be waited and seen.</p>
<p>Behind Zhang Xueliang's politics, there are still more than 4,000 bandits scattered in Manchuria and Mongolia, and more than 8,000 restorationists, all of whom depend on our breath and are treated with our appeasement. In the event that the infighting within the Feng faction becomes apparent, we will merge these two forces into one, and especially add unscrupulous Koreans to them... At that time, whether we want to incline to the Luan faction or support the old faction, or even make Manchuria and Mongolia the world of the restoration faction to achieve our ideal, this can be determined according to how our national interests are. (Lu Min's note) Making Manchuria and Mongolia the world of the restoration faction is to achieve the Japanese people's ideal. What ideal is it? Even the ideal of making Manchuria and Mongolia the second Korea. I hope that the people of the country will pay attention to Japan's current violent and cruel actions, which are intended to realize the above-mentioned ideal. If bandits and restorationists recognize thieves as their fathers, their crimes cannot be forgiven, and their foolishness is also beyond reach.</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty concluded at the Washington Conference after the European War bound the empire's free actions in Manchuria and Mongolia. If the empire were to confront it with aggressive imperialism, it would inevitably arouse misunderstandings in various countries. Because of this relationship, Manchuria-Mongolia policy must have opportunities in both international and Chinese aspects before it can be decided. It is not like the Zhang Zuolin government era, when everything can be done according to our opinion. The South Manchuria Railway sacrificed more than 200,000 people and used a total of more than 800 staff to create a register of Manchuria-Mongolia bandits and appease their leaders. All of this was to create this opportunity, and the Staff Department used the Black Dragon Society, the Patriotic Society, the Daika Society, etc., and linked them with the imperialists, just to create their opportunity. Such as specially organizing secret investigation agencies in Yingkou, Huludao, and Bei Ning Road... such as moving the authorities of Usuri and the Eastern Railway of Red Russia to cooperate with us, all of this is to promote the progress of our rights and interests. According to Nanman, make this underwater effort and sacrifice such a large amount of money, all to create a God-given opportunity for me, in order to assist my Manchuria-Mongolia policy and become a golden city and iron wall. Here it is sufficient to prove that President Sengoku is extremely eager to seek a fundamental and beneficial solution to the Manchuria-Mongolia problem, in order to establish a hundred-year plan for the country. It is clear that it is by no means as incompetent and helpless as the outside world proclaims. (Lu Min's note) Japan's resolute implementation of the Manchuria-Mongolia policy today, according to the above explanation, is because it has learned from the international financial panic and the frequent disasters in our country, the so-called arrival of the God-given opportunity, so it dares to take measures to achieve its final goal. Recently, the international atmosphere has been poor, and it has also instructed the restoration faction and bandits to recklessly sabotage. Although the Japanese are cunning, how can they cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Respectfully Informing the Educational Community of Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>(3) Shu Xincheng</p>
<p>Three: Spiritual Strength. I bring up the words "spiritual strength," and some will surely laugh at me as being pedantic. In reality, the reason that humans are different from other animals is that, besides material desires, there is also spiritual function. What is called the "spirit of the people" and the "national soul" are nothing more than expressions of this spiritual function. What is called a "patriot sacrificing himself for the sake of righteousness" and a "loyal minister serving his ruler and repaying the country" are all governed by this spiritual function. In China over the past 30 years, due to frequent internal unrest, the central thought and central belief that sustained the nation have been completely destroyed. Moreover, foreign aggression has been pressing hard, leading to repeated failures. The nation's confidence in stabilizing and securing the country has also gradually diminished. Today, besides increasing material strength in education, in the spiritual aspect, I, as a friend, believe that the following matters should be given at least the most attention:</p>
<p>A. Cultivation of Self-Confidence. China has the most ancient founding and the earliest culture. Whether from the perspective of the nation or the individual, it can be proven that our intelligence and wisdom are not inferior to others. Although in recent years the nation has been weakened due to the intertwined pressure of foreign aggression and internal unrest, this is temporary and inevitable in a transitional era (the French Revolution is a precedent). Our people should not lose heart because of this. We should have confidence in the ability to promote national glory and confidence that, through the efforts of the people, China can permanently stand tall in the world. This belief should be cultivated from history and geography textbooks. Any shallow mentality of fearing and fawning over foreigners should be driven out relentlessly (such as using English on postage stamps and store invoices, which greatly affect the national self-esteem, should not be ignored because they are small), and in practice.</p>
<p>B. Cultivation of the Spirit of the Rule of Law. China lacks the spirit of the rule of law due to various historical reasons. In an era of isolation, rule by people could still be self-sustaining, but now a nation cannot stand without the rule of law. This lack of spirit, on one hand, reduces solidarity and enterprising spirit, and on the other hand, increases selfishness and a desire for good luck (the current Japanese earthquake, even newspapers openly show schadenfreude, the nation's desire for good luck is completely exposed). At the same time, it is also the source of internal unrest. Educators must recognize this harm and lead by example to train young people to implement the rule of law in practice. C. Cultivation of Patriotism. The nation is where our people live and entrust their lives. The good or bad, survival or death of the nation has a close relationship with the individual. Anyone who invades our nation is invading myself. Dying for the nation and avenging the nation have the same meaning and importance as dying for an individual and avenging an individual. And the former is even more glorious than the latter because it can sacrifice the small self to protect the big self. This meaning is now rarely mentioned. The educational community, because "politics is a hot potato," even avoids saying the word "nation." However, "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." At this critical moment of national crisis and survival, how can the far-sighted educational community sit idly by? Cultivating a generous and united patriotic heart in young people is a priority in current education.</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of the Educational Community</h3>
<h3>Plan for Economic Severance with Japan</h3>
<h3>Guiding Principles for Anti-Japanese National Salvation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Educational Community National Salvation Federation held its second city-wide representatives' conference yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. at Wuben Girls' School, Xiaoximen. It resolved to pass four important cases, including the guiding principles for anti-Japanese national salvation, a concrete plan for economic severance with Japan, and various important matters such as regulations. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives Present: Representatives from various schools attended yesterday, including Chen Gonglu from the Sino-French Institute of Technology, Li Zhaoshi from Jiaotong University, Hu Shuhua from Tongji University, Chu Fucheng from the Law School, Ou Yuanhuai from Daxia University, Gao Renou from Tongde School, Guo Qiyuan from Jiannan Hospital, Sun Xiangyuan from Soochow University, Cheng Xin from Wusong Middle School, Cai Yan from the YMCA Middle School, Zhang Yiceng from Datong University, Xu Peikun from Central University, Wan Rong from Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, Yang Weiyu from the Chinese Vocational Education Society, Zheng Xiwang from Shanghai High School, Wang Xiaoying from Wuben Girls' School, and other representatives from major and minor schools, about 400 people.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: The meeting began at 3:00 p.m. with Hu Shuhua and Jiang Wenyu reporting on the work progress of the Executive Committee. Then, Hu Shuhua reported on the process of petitioning in Guangdong, and Zhang Mupin, a professor from Northeastern Fengyong University, reported on the destruction of Fengyong University. Following this, various cases were discussed and various plans were passed. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Important Resolutions: Four important resolutions were passed yesterday, including: (1) A resolution to send a telegram to Zhang Xueliang, setting a deadline for investigating the whereabouts of Fengyong. It was resolved to pass the telegram to the Executive Committee for handling. (2) A resolution to curb the opportunistic price increases of domestic goods. It was resolved that the Executive Committee should suggest that various anti-Japanese associations handle the matter. (3) A resolution to promote the organization of anti-Japanese national salvation associations in the national educational community. It was resolved to hand it over to the Executive Committee for handling. (4) Review of slogans: it was resolved to retain them. Plan for Economic Severance with Japan: (A) Economic severance with Japan covers a wide range and involves many methods. However, not using Japanese goods is actually the most important method among various methods. This plan is specifically aimed at this simple goal, and the effectiveness of previous boycotts of Japanese goods is difficult to determine. Judging from the number of imported goods in the Customs trade register, the effect is quite small. Therefore, some people inevitably have doubts about this matter. In fact, the previous efforts were not great, all because the handling was not good. The reason why the handling was not good was because of the lack of "methods." This time, it is not difficult to be at the forefront. Everyone's conscience is aroused, and of course, people cannot be judged by normal reasoning. The plan must be perfect, the organization must be precise, the application must be appropriate, and the progress must be swift, which is also related to the issue of methods. Based on past experience, learning from past mistakes, we should gather multiple wisdom and discuss methods that have fewer drawbacks and more benefits, in order to first try it out in the Shanghai educational community. (B) In order to ensure that this plan can be implemented permanently and effectively, the following three principles are listed: (1) The scope should be expanded. (2) The time should be sustained. (3) The research should be precise. Taking it a step further, the nature of Japanese goods is classified into the following three categories, and three people from each university's business and engineering departments will conduct research on them one by one: (1) Those that can be replaced by existing domestic goods. (2) Those that can be dispensed with. (3) Those that can be manufactured ourselves. (C) Once the principles are established, further details and methods are discussed: (1) The association will prepare and print a pledge form (with a vow) for distribution to various schools. The vows are: 1. I resolve not to use Japanese goods. 2. My family members resolve not to use Japanese goods. 3. I will advise my relatives and friends not to use Japanese goods. (2) All pledgers should purchase a badge after filling out the pledge form and wear it all day long to show their determination. This badge will be produced by the association on behalf of the pledgers, with each badge priced at seven cents. At the time, each school and organization can contact the distribution for as many as they need. (3) After receiving the pledge form, each school and organization should convene a general meeting of all faculty, staff, and students to explain the three major principles of not using Japanese goods and the methods for filling out the pledge form and purchasing and wearing badges. The reasons for filling out the pledge form and badges must also be explained in detail. (4) When convening the general meeting, each school and organization should also propose the following two matters and agree to implement them: (1) Use the method of ten-person groups, with each person responsible for separately pledging nine people to fill out the form, purchase the badge, and not use Japanese goods. After the group is complete, report to the person in charge of the school or organization, collect the pledge forms, submit them, and prepare the price to receive the badges and wear them. In addition, the other nine people should continue to seek comrades in this way. The more you promote, the wider it can be spread. The procedures for taking the pledge form and purchasing the badge can be handled by the original person in charge to contact the relevant agency. (2) Among the people in each school and organization, those who can undertake part or all of the research work can form groups on their own and handle investigation, editing, suggestions, publicity, advocacy, liaison, assistance, and other matters in their spare time. (5) Each school and organization must designate one or two staff members of this agency to be responsible for handling this matter. (6) After the Executive Committee of the Association resolves and approves the funding for this case, in addition to notifying the schools and organizations present to implement it as appropriate, it will also try to promote it to other agencies and organizations, hoping that they will all adopt it.</p>
<p>Guiding Principles for Anti-Japanese National Salvation: (1) The Necessary Understanding of Anti-Japanese National Salvation: 1. Japan's active policy of invading Manchuria and Mongolia. 2. The causes of Japan's invasion of our country. 3. The process of Japan's invasion of our country. 4. The current situation of Japan's invasion of our country's Northeast. 5. The geographical situation of our country's Northeast. 6. The current situation after the Meiji Restoration in Japan. (2) The Necessary Spirit of Anti-Japanese National Salvation: 1. Vow to avenge the shame and save the country with wisdom, courage, loyalty, and trustworthiness. 2. Define avenging the shame and revenge as the goal of anti-Japanese severance efforts. 3. To always not cooperate with Japan and sever economic relations. 4. Develop a spirit of hard work, diligence, self-improvement, and unyielding. 5. To have the determination to study hard and save the country with diligent study. 6. To have the will to strive for progress and cultivate personality and morality. (3) The Work of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement: 1. Regarding military training: A. In accordance with the Central Regulations on the Education Outline for Volunteer Soldiers, schools should organize student volunteer soldiers and juvenile volunteer soldiers. B. Implement military training and exercise physical fitness. C. Train female students with knowledge and skills in nursing, rescue, telecommunications, etc. D. Schools should jointly organize a central agency for unified command and training. E. Volunteer soldiers should absolutely obey discipline. F. Volunteer soldiers should permanently wear blue cloth with white characters on their left arm: "Unite, Struggle, Avenge Shame, Save the Country." 2.

<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of University Students</h3>
<p>The 13th Meeting of Cadres</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of University Students in this city held its 13th cadre meeting at the Youth Propaganda Corps, Xiaonanmen, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. Those present included Cao Peizi from Guanghua University, Ping Zuren from Jinan University, Gu Duanwu from Jiangnan College, Xu Guanbin from Daxia University, Zhang Shousong from the Law School, Chen Yuejiang from the Sino-French Institute of Technology, Lu Xizhen from Fudan University, Zheng Dingying from Chizhi College, Zhang Kunyu from Datong University, Duan Bojun from China Public School, Chu Fucheng, the joint representative of the university presidents, Tao Baichuan, the representative of the City Party Department, Xu Guanbin, the chairman, and Cao Peizi, the recorder. After performing the rituals, the meeting officially began. (1) Zhu Youxuan, a representative participating in the Joint Conference of University Presidents, reported the opinions of the presidents of various schools on the implementation of military training. (A) President Ou Yuanhuai of Daxia said that because the circumstances of each school are different, some universities organize committees. Therefore, the military training issue, which is related to administration, must be resolved by the academic affairs meeting before it can be implemented. However, military training is not a problem of suspension, but the premise is that students can truly be trained. Secondly, the problems that arise are courses, playgrounds, instructors, guns, etc. President Liu Zhanen of Shanghai University said that regarding military training, the central government has already discussed a comprehensive approach. This is the most important issue for Japan and must be sustained. During the European war, there were those who saved the country by eating vegetarian food and intensifying their studies, so studying is also a type of national salvation work. The current simultaneous attention should be paid to economic severance and international publicity. This time, a wealthy businessman in Luzon was able to donate a huge sum of 250,000 yuan to be used as funds for international publicity. If domestic donations can be made again, it can be implemented. President Chu of Shanghai Law School said that the principles of military training proposed by the Student Federation can be fully accepted, but the methods must be considered and implemented according to the circumstances of each school. Secretary-General Jin Tong of Fudan University said that military training is very important at the moment and can make students' lives disciplined. President Hu Shuhua of Tongji University said that a military training office must be established. Freehand exercises can be carried out on the playgrounds of various schools. If gun exercises are required, they can be carried out at the military training office. (2) President Chu Cheng reported on the attitude of the presidents of various schools regarding the implementation of military training. (3) City Party Department representative Tao Baichuan reported. (4) The representative of the Sino-French Institute of Technology reported on the school's situation. (5) Shanghai Law School reported that it had recently discovered a reactionary declaration issued by the federation's petition delegation. (6) Various departments reported the allocation of duties: A. Director of the General Affairs Department (Daxia), Document (Guanghua), Accounting (Jiaotong University), Communication (Fudan), General Affairs (Law School) (B) Director of the Military Training Department (Jinan), other departments have not yet been assigned. (7) Motions: (A) Motion to suspend classes for half a day after Friday for military training for five weeks. It was resolved to pass the proposal in accordance with the principles proposed by the Law School. Each school must have at least two hours and no more than four hours of military training per day. There are still cases of transfer from the same school, disputes between the Law and Political Science College, etc.</p>
<h3>Chizhi and Jiaotong Universities Officially Resume Classes</h3>
<p>Chizhi College, both the university and middle school departments, had previously suspended classes for a day due to rampant rumors and students leaving the school. Recently, after repeated explanations from the authorities, classes resumed as usual yesterday. All students who left the school will be considered as absent. All students of Jiaotong University have resumed classes and issued a declaration, one paragraph of which says, "The past anti-Japanese national salvation work is necessary in the process, but it is a stopgap measure and temporary. We now believe that it is necessary to end it. This does not mean that we will not participate in the national salvation movement in the future, but that the method of participation should change. From the results of this petition, we can see that the government has a final determination on Japan. What we should prepare for is to prepare for a declaration of war against Japan. Because of the above reasons, we are now intensifying military training to be reserve soldiers. At the same time, we use our special training to have those who study civil engineering add the study of military defense and demolition engineering, those who study electrical engineering add the study of military transportation engineering, power grids and radio, those who study mechanical engineering add the study of repairing gun engineering, those who study chemistry add the study of military chemistry courses, those who study mathematics and physics add the study of ballistics and meteorology, those who study management add the study of military transport engineering. We each do our best to prepare for a declaration of war. We are definitely not ignoring national affairs because of attending classes, but preparing for the work of declaring war on Japan by attending classes. At the same time, we are still continuing our publicity work. When necessary, we are prepared to sacrifice our studies and strike."</p>
<h3>Nanyang Business School Does Not Suspend Classes Due to Rumors</h3>
<p>The rumors in Zhabei two days ago caused widespread panic. The Nanyang Commercial Senior Middle School on Tiantong'an Road happened to be adjacent to the Japanese Naval Headquarters. All the students gathered and held an emergency meeting. First, Li Dongqing, the captain of the student volunteer army, spoke, saying that students should remain calm and not be swayed by rumors, nor should they rely on the concession for shelter. All the students were united in their determination to coexist and die with the school in case of misfortune, so they continued to attend classes as usual in recent days.</p>
<h3>Zheng Yuxiu Resigns as President of the Law and Political Science College</h3>
<p>All Students Unanimously Retain Her</p>

<p>| Today at 3:00 p.m. at the Baseball Field |</p>
<p>| Jinan Students Do Not Participate in the Shanghai Team |</p>
<p>The Malayan Overseas Chinese football team made its debut in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and its magnificence was astonishing. The Shanghai champion West Brigade team was eclipsed by it and succumbed. Today at 3:00 p.m., the team will meet the Shanghai China team at the China Baseball Field. The Chinese players are the football representatives of the National Games. In name, this match is not a competition for the national championship, but in substance, Shanghai represents East China. Therefore, the victory or defeat of both sides is related to the people and can be used to distinguish the level of football in Malaya and East China. It is not comparable to ordinary organizations and individual schools. All those who have been selected as football representatives must recognize the importance of their responsibility and express their spirit of cooperation, benevolence, morality, and superb skills, and meet our dear overseas Chinese on the battlefield. The leader of the Shanghai team is Chen Zhang'e, the director of physical education at Jinan. He is a specialist in dispatching troops and generals. At that time, he will strategize with the Association to satisfy the desire of all Shanghai fans. The lineups of the two teams will be finalized temporarily. The list of both sides is as follows:</p>

<p>Message from the Sports Promotion Association</p>
<p>At around 9:00 p.m. last night, a message was suddenly received from the Association, saying that "the Shanghai team's lineup is the same as the Shanghai team selected for the city sports meeting, most of whom are Zhenru and Donghua team members. Now, Chen Pu, Qiu Dongxian, and Zhuang Shihong are unable to attend due to illness. Last night, news was received from Jinan University that the school's players will not participate as a whole for some reason, so the lineup for the Shanghai team playing today must be finalized temporarily." (Tickets are sold for six cents and one yuan. Association complimentary tickets are not valid.)</p>
<p>Reasons for Jinan's Non-Participation</p>
<p>Chen Zhang'e, the director of physical education at Jinan University, stated the reasons why Jinan students will not participate in the China team today as follows: Yesterday, Jinan requested the Sports Promotion Association to advance the game between Jinan and Malaya on the 12th to today, because Jinan is weaker than the Shanghai team and should have the weaker team play Malaya first, but the Sports Promotion Association refused. If so, Jinan will participate in the Shanghai team today and will also play Malaya separately on the 12th. Moreover, Jinan has already scheduled a game with the Navy on the 11th, which would be too many games and exhaust them.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Sees Slight Increase Again</h3>
<p>The market situation is fluctuating and uncertain. Yesterday, the 8th, the benchmark gold price changed unpredictably, the situation was complicated and difficult to ascertain. The morning market hovered around 700 taels, while the afternoon market was often above 700 taels. There were a total of 18 taels of fluctuations throughout the day. As a result, the price rose by more than six taels, the market was turbulent, and people were unsettled, as if they were in a fog. Transactions were also varied. The price rose at the beginning of the morning, due to large orders expecting further increases that did not materialize. However, sellers were quick to react and took a downward turn, suddenly dropping to 691-692 taels. Furthermore, the exchange rate started to show deficits. Later, the US dollar exchange rate contracted and the internal market stabilized, especially as various firms were eager to buy, causing a rapid surge of more than ten taels, almost reaching 710 taels. However, there was much confusion in between, with prices rising and falling from time to time. The afternoon market was relatively calm, with little fluctuation. Observing the situation, the future is still subject to change.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the opening price jumped by 7 taels and 2 qian, to 704.5 taels. Silver bars remained the same, while US silver rose by 3/8. Transactions were sparse and did not cause any significant movement. Next was 705 taels. Unexpectedly, Fengyongfu, Changhengchang, Yongtong, and Taichang and others dumped their holdings, immediately driving the price downstream, breaking the 700 tael barrier. In addition, the British gold exchange rate could settle at 17.875, and the US dollar also weakened as it was sold, eventually reaching 32.75 yuan. Therefore, in just over ten minutes, the price plummeted by more than 13 taels, finally reaching 691.5 taels. Soon after, buyers increased, and Cuichang, Yongfu, Changhengxing, and arbitrageurs took advantage of the drop to buy in, happily moving upwards, returning to above 700 taels. The US dollar could be sold for 32.25 yuan. However, there were occasional fluctuations of two taels. The British gold exchange rate once reached 17.9375, and the US dollar exchange rate was 32.5625.

Afterwards, the Guangdong banks and Yifeng, Yongtongchun, Hengchangyong and others sold. The British gold exchange rate of 17.875 was acceptable for both buying and selling, and the US dollar was 32.25 yuan. The gold price suddenly fell again by more than eight taels, reaching 699.5 taels at 10:45. In an instant, the Wanghu brokers became active, and Shunli and Yifeng and others bought in.

Retail investors came to sell, and Chengfeng, Yongtong, Taichang, Dadecheng and others successively competed to buy. After a quarter of an hour, it jumped to 707 taels. At 11:30, it was 709.8 qian (shouting over 710 taels). At this time, Daxingyong came to sell, immediately slashing the price by 6-7 taels. Speculators also sold, so it was 703 taels. The closing price was 704 taels, continuing to trade at 702-703 taels. Because the telegraphic transfer rate from India and the exchange rate from Anna increased, the listed price was changed to 786-787 taels, with a deduction of about 80 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was originally in a state of consolidation. The opening price of the afternoon market was 703 taels, followed by 703.5 taels to 701.2 qian.

<h3>Bond Market Had Major Reversal Yesterday</h3>
<p>Afternoon Market Soars, Trading Halted</p>
<p>Market Sentiment Suddenly Improves, Various Parties Aggressively Buy in at Low Prices</p>
<p>Many November Contracts Opened, Market Conditions Improve</p>
<p>Yesterday (8th), the bond market conditions at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw relatively few spot transactions despite several types opening for trading. Many November contracts were opened for trading, and market conditions improved, with buying and selling becoming more active, as there were significant changes in various prices. In recent weeks, the serious impact of the diplomatic situation with Japan has caused widespread anxiety. The major national floods this summer, and the prolonged failure to resolve the Guangdong issue, have also made people hesitant to invest in bonds, leading to a sharp decline of over 10-20 yuan in bond prices over the past two weeks. This excessive decline was due to the weakness of market sentiment. Once market sentiment stabilized, the reaction was inevitably strong. Observing the trend of yesterday's bond market prices, the buying interest was already active in the morning, with aggressive buying at low prices. However, there was still a general sense of hesitation, resulting in some prices rising and others falling, creating a very chaotic situation. The second half of the day saw stronger gains, with issues such as the 20-year customs bonds, consolidated tax bonds, and salt tax bonds rising significantly. In the afternoon, news spread that the diplomatic situation was turning around, and that peace in Guangdong could be achieved soon. As a result, market sentiment improved significantly, and buying interest was strong. Various bonds then saw demand exceed supply, rising four yuan higher than the previous day's registered price, leading to a halt in trading. The November contracts also rose four yuan higher than the initial opening in the morning, leading to a halt in trading. Only a few issues, such as the consolidated six customs bonds, demobilization bonds, and 96 bonds, did not reach the trading halt. It is important to note that the overall bond market situation is still not optimistic. However, if the diplomatic situation does not worsen, there is hope for continued stability. The total spot trading for the day was 20,000 yuan, and the total futures trading was 13,750,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Chaotic Yarn Market Situation</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, but the trend remained chaotic and inconsistent, leading to market uncertainty. In general, during this period of anti-Japanese movement, the market cannot have a fixed trend due to the shortage of goods. However, prices are too high and sales are sluggish. In the afternoon, rumors spread in the market that Indian yarn prices were cheaper and that it might be imported to Shanghai if the price of local yarn rose too much. However, based on current calculations, the price of coarse yarn is still not cheaper than local yarn. Only fine yarn is cheaper than Shanghai yarn, causing the market sentiment to suddenly loosen.</p>
<p>The Near-Term is Firm, the Far-Term is Weak. The opening of the domestic yarn market in the morning saw steady American cotton, and the market was still tense. Prices rose by 1.297 qian across all months. In the afternoon, rumors spread that Indian yarn was being sold at low prices, causing the market to weaken significantly, with prices falling by 1.567 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 44,600 bales. According to the data, Changji sold 1,100 bales, Zhenda sold 900 bales, Yichang sold 800 bales, Deji sold 850 bales, Changfeng sold 1,900 bales, and Taixing sold 800 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Suddenly Turns Downward</h3>
<p>The cotton market turned downward because most people expected American cotton to have an active upward trend, but now the telegrams show a decline of 10 British pounds, and the strong upward momentum suddenly weakened. In general, there is too much bottom stock, and the selling price of foreign cotton is still low, making it difficult for the market to be very good. Also, the gold market has a downward trend, so manufacturers are still buying foreign cotton and selling domestic cotton. The Hankou gang is also closing out its long positions, and the future is still difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>Hankou Market Suddenly Drops by 5 Qian: The Hankou market opened in the morning, and the American cotton market fell, making the market sentiment very weak, with prices falling by 2-3 qian across all months. The afternoon was even weaker, with prices falling by 2-4 qian across all months. The total transaction volume for the day was 155,100 dan.

<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement Developments</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Declares Perseverance and Unyielding Spirit</p>
<p>Labor Unions Declare Resolution Not to Stop</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association Declares Fundraising for National Salvation</p>
<p>Chinese Employees of Guangdong Maru Steamer Resign</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>Unyielding to Power Until the Goal Is Achieved</p>
<p>Steadfastness and Endurance Are the Only Path to Success</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a declaration regarding the anti-Japanese national salvation movement, stating: "Since the Japanese military forcefully occupied the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, they have intensified their actions, deploying troops and dispatching warships to threaten our coastal areas. Their intentions are clear: to destroy our country and enslave our people. Compatriots across the nation, having reached the limit of their endurance, have risen up to save the country, acting swiftly and speaking in unison. Since this Chamber convened a general membership meeting and resolved to sever relations with Japan, various industries have spontaneously and thoroughly engaged in boycotts of Japanese goods. From resolution to action, for several days, they have been conducting self-organized inspections, encouraging each other, making final decisions, and planning for the long term. However, rumors are circulating that the Japanese side is threatening and imposing restrictions. It should be known that patriotism is the duty of every citizen, and there are no regulations forcing people to buy. We cannot force others to buy our goods, nor can others force us to buy theirs. This principle is clear and needs no further explanation. We only hope that the merchants and people of our city will continue to uphold the spirit of steadfastness and sincerity, vowing to never forget their determination. They must understand the immense responsibility of saving the country and the nation, enduring hardship and toil, persevering with unwavering resolve, and never yielding to power until the final goal is achieved. They must abandon the habits of superficiality and exaggeration, seeking only incremental progress. It takes ten years to grow a tree, let alone succeed in saving the country. Steadfastness and endurance are the only path. We issue this sincere declaration, hoping for mutual encouragement."</p>
<p>All Municipal</p>
<p>Labor Unions Issue a Solemn Declaration</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Movement Will Not Stop as Long as the Brutal Japanese Army Does Not Withdraw</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports: The city's postal workers' union, publishing industry union, six district water and electricity industry union, four district cigarette industry union, five district cigarette industry union, one district water and electricity industry union, seven district cotton textile industry union, pharmaceutical industry union, shipbuilding industry union, and 85 other labor unions, yesterday issued a declaration stating: "Since the Wan incident occurred, malicious assaults have targeted Chinese people. Our countrymen, suffering deeply, have cried out in agony, seeking justice and the triumph of reason. However, the brutal Japanese, using the Nakamura incident as a pretext, destroyed our South Manchuria Railway and launched a full-scale invasion. The flames of their poisonous ambitions spread everywhere, turning tens of millions of compatriots in the Eastern Provinces into slaves, and turning tens of thousands of miles of Liaoning and Jilin into territories that are no longer ours. Our people are weeping tears of blood, enduring and seeking international arbitration in the hope that the brutal Japanese will restrain themselves. For over two weeks, this Association has responded to the urgent demands and been driven by conscience, mindful that the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual, and that in the face of national peril, we must rise together to survive. From the Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Association to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, we have resolutely severed relations with Japan in order to destroy the fatal enemy, the Japanese invaders, who are irreconcilable with us. Since the implementation of these measures, the results have been significant. This is a manifestation of the awakening of conscience and the collective self-reliance of our entire nation, and we find it very gratifying. However, on the 6th of this month, the cruel Japanese actually warned our government to stop the anti-Japanese national salvation movement and dispatched a large number of warships to China to demonstrate their power. Alas, our countrymen, after being slowly tortured to near death, are still not allowed to groan. What era in human history has seen such cruelty? It is our duty to pledge our determination that as long as the brutal Japanese army does not withdraw and cease all acts of aggression, our anti-Japanese national salvation movement will not cease for a single day. We hope that all compatriots across the country, at this critical juncture when a knife is at our throats, will contribute their ideas, unite together, and obey the unified command of the government to fight a life-or-death battle with the brutal Japanese, so that we can restore our territory and preserve our sovereignty. We humbly present our humble opinions for your consideration."</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Sentiment Amidst Shipping News</p>
<p>Chinese Employees of Japanese Steamships Resign: Many Chinese managers of Japanese commercial firms in Japan have resigned. Our local Osaka Company also received a telegram from Hong Kong yesterday stating that on the Guangdong Maru steamer of the company's Hong Kong and Keelung branches, all the lower-ranking Chinese crew members had resigned to the Japanese this time the ship arrived in Hong Kong. Sailors and stokers also left the ship en masse, nearly rendering the ship unable to sail. Later, it was able to sail after temporarily hiring foreigners in Hong Kong. This is the first ship where Chinese maritime workers have refused to cooperate with the Japanese.</p>
<p>Nisshin Employee Beaten: Nisshin Company recently had a batch of goods transported to Qingdao. Fearing that unloading would be impossible if shipped on their own company's vessel, they switched to a British ship for export. As usual, they sent a Chinese employee, Zhang Wenqing, to the Taikoo Company to obtain the bill of lading. Upon arriving in front of Taikoo, he was recognized by colleagues from a customs brokerage, who tried to dissuade him. When he refused, the customs brokers dragged Zhang down and beat him. After being beaten, Zhang sought help from the Taikoo taipan, an Englishman, who said that since this was a patriotic movement, foreigners should not interfere. Later, a Japanese employee from Nisshin arrived and took Zhang back to the company.</p>
<p>Continued Arrival of Students and Overseas Chinese: Yesterday, more students and overseas Chinese returned home on the Shanghai Maru steamer, including Zheng Renli, Yu Xunhan, Li Shengmeng, and 130 others. 49 others, including Li Gengfu, Li Jinzong, and Yang Shunli, returned home on the Maya Maru steamer. 26 others, including Zhu Shunlin and Lin Zhirong, arrived in Shanghai on the Mikasa Maru steamer.

<h3>Declaration for Fundraising for National Salvation</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday issued a declaration stating: "Alas, China is plagued by natural disasters and man-made calamities, and the people are struggling to survive. The brutal Japanese are taking advantage of this opportunity to carry out aggression. The occupation of Liaoning and Jilin is not enough; they are deploying troops and dispatching warships to exert their threats. Their intentions are clear: to achieve their so-called conquest of Manchuria and Mongolia in order to dissect our entire country of China. Anyone with blood in their veins cannot endure this any longer. Now, compatriots across the country are rising up to resist Japan, united as one, and not looking back. Volunteer armies are beginning to be recruited, international propaganda is being actively pursued, and economic severance is vowed for eternity. However, there are myriad ways to save the country, and economics is the key. The representatives of all sectors of this city have resolved that from today onwards, fundraising for national salvation will begin. All Chinese banks, money shops, and trust companies in this city have the obligation to collect donations. Each bank, money shop, and trust company must affix its seal or have the deputy manager sign and seal each receipt as proof and must not refuse to collect. They must report to this association every ten days for publication in the newspapers. Every little bit helps, and people should sacrifice their wealth to relieve the national crisis. Alas, our compatriots, our beloved compatriots, if you do not want to see your country perish in your lifetime, if you do not want to be slaves and beasts of burden, if you do not want your children and grandchildren to be slaughtered and trampled upon, then today is the time to generously donate. The people of Korea shared a kitchen knife among three households, and even speaking in groups of three or five was subject to interference. When they finally realized the tragedy of losing their country and their homes, it was too late to sacrifice their lives and donate their wealth. When the nest is overturned, no egg remains unbroken. Saving the country is saving oneself. We implore the nation with nine prostrations. Our fathers, brothers, uncles, siblings, sisters, why do you not come forth?"</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Being Organized and Inspected</h3>
<p>Volunteer Army Seeks Patriotic Songs: Since the Volunteer Army began its registration process, tens of thousands of passionate youths have registered to join. The organization and inspection process has been ongoing for days. However, the army's song has not yet been composed. It is essential that the lyrics deeply convey the meaning of anti-Japanese national salvation and that the melody is majestic enough to inspire morale. The army is earnestly soliciting submissions from song-writing experts and educators and welcomes contributions from all sectors.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Suggestion Boxes to Be Installed: The Anti-Japanese Association has been receiving numerous letters daily from various sectors requesting the installation of anti-Japanese suggestion boxes in prominent locations. The association has decided at a standing committee meeting to install six or seven boxes in prominent locations in order to gather collective wisdom and meet the public's expectations.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>Warns Tianjin Piece Goods Merchants</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has learned that Tianjin merchants in this city transported 400 pieces of Japanese goods on September 29th and another 600 pieces on October 2nd. This constitutes a deliberate attempt to undermine the anti-Japanese effort. The association has warned these Tianjin merchants that they must not transport Japanese goods again in the future. Once discovered, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Efforts in Various Sectors</h3>
<p>Printing Industry Establishes Inspection Team: The Printing Industry Association convened a meeting of representatives yesterday to discuss national salvation.

After reporting on the inspection work of recent days, the discussion items were presented. The following six proposals were passed by the entire body: (1) All committee members, along with inspectors, will immediately set out to inspect and seal Japanese goods from members. (2) Regardless of whether or not the Japanese goods found at members' businesses have been registered with the Anti-Japanese Association, they will be sealed by this association and reported to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for disposition. (3) A stamp with the phrase "Forever Economically Severed from Japan" must be affixed to invoices to demonstrate resolve. (4) A notice will be sent to each business soliciting volunteer inspectors for this association. (5) A notice will be sent to each business asking those willing to serve in the National Salvation Volunteer Army to register with the National Salvation Volunteer Army Recruiting Office of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. (6) Representatives of each business will submit sworn statements. It has also been reported that, in order to demonstrate its determination to resist Japan and save the country, the Seafood and Sundries Industry Association sent a telegram to Japanese merchants some days ago, severing relations with Japan immediately and requesting them to return to their country as soon as possible. The association has received replies and is currently winding down operations in preparation for returning home in the coming days.</p>

The meeting adjourned with slogans.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Representatives' Congress of the Two Railway Unions: Shen Bao</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the museum and relayed to all compatriots in the nation: The brutal Japanese are violating international law, destroying peace, occupying the Eastern Provinces, and advancing troops into the interior in order to realize their dream of military aggression.

Saving the country and the people is the shared desire of all. We earnestly hope to end internal strife and avoid fraternal bloodshed. This telegram is urgent.

<h3>Japanese Hope to</h3>
<p>Use Military Force to Suppress Anti-Japanese Movement</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources yesterday, the Japanese government has now decided that troops will not be withdrawn on the 14th of this month. Japanese military officers have also openly made statements about overthrowing the League of Nations. The Japanese navy is now acting in unison with the army, taking active measures. Four Japanese warships arrived some days ago, and more warships, aircraft, armored vehicles, and over-mountain guns are being transferred to Shanghai from Sasebo, as if preparing for war against us. It is unknown how our country's authorities will respond. The information known is reported separately below.</p>
<p>Tokiwa Battleship to Arrive in China Today: The Japanese Navy</p>
<p>Ministry has ordered the Sasebo Naval Base to have three ships, the 2nd-class coastal defense ship Tokiwa, the Izumo, and the special service ship Notoro, load 400 marines onto the Tokiwa starting on the 6th. The remaining two ships will be loaded with armored gun carriages, military supply trucks, military aircraft, and military supplies to sail to Shanghai. Our local source confirmed yesterday that the Tokiwa has completed loading the marines and will depart first today. The Izumo and others will follow immediately. The marines will disembark upon arrival in Shanghai, and the aircraft and gun carriages will also be moved to land for the purpose of intimidating the Chinese. Mitsui Wharf has prepared for the ship to moor.</p>
<p>Momo and Hinoki Depart for the Yangtze Yesterday: Commander Tanaka Osamu of the Japanese 24th Fleet and the commander of the First Overseas Detachment stationed in Shanghai jointly decided that the Momo and Hinoki would leave Shanghai yesterday morning and head to Zhenjiang and Daye.

<h3>Mayor Zhang's Remarks</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang Qun returned to Shanghai from Nanjing last night (the 8th) at 11:00 PM. Reporters met him on the train and asked three questions: (1) What important report did the Mayor make to the central government on this trip, and what important tasks will he undertake after returning to Shanghai? The Mayor replied, "I have not been to Nanjing for some time because the municipal government is busy. I took the opportunity to travel there because Commander Xiong returned to Shanghai to meet President Chiang and report on the security situation in Shanghai. There were no important matters to report. After returning to Shanghai, I have no special mission." The reporters then asked: (2) It is heard that the students of the Central University in Nanjing have resolved to stage a general strike. Is this true? The Mayor replied, "There are many rumors in Shanghai, which have been transmitted to the capital. Students are deeply patriotic and extremely agitated, believing that the time has come to give up their pens and take up arms. Therefore, there was a resolution to stage a general strike. However, it has recently become clear that the rumors are untrue, and the talk of a general strike has been canceled. I heard that students from Central University had sent representatives to Shanghai to contact various schools. I hope that schools in Shanghai will not spread misinformation and cause disturbances." The reporters then asked: (3) What is the situation in Guangdong? The Mayor replied, "Chen Mingshu will arrive in Shanghai today, accompanied by Li Wenfan, Gu Mengyu, Huang Huabiao, and others. When they will go to Nanjing after arriving in Shanghai will be known after we meet. I have not heard anything about the rumors that a preparatory meeting will be held in Shanghai first."</p>
<h3>Overseas Representatives Attending the Fourth National Congress</h3>
<p>Conversations in Shanghai en Route to Beijing</p>
<p>The Nation Should Consider the Root Cause When Resisting Violent Japan</p>
<p>Overseas representatives attending the Fourth National Congress Wu Zhaohai, Wu Mingchao, Wu Shichao, and Li Ciwen (all from British territories) arrived in Shanghai yesterday and registered at the office. As of yesterday, a total of 33 representatives had arrived, with 19 having already proceeded to Beijing. Additionally, Wang Canfen, a representative from the French branch, and Mo Yao, a representative from London, departed for Beijing yesterday morning on a special express train. Representatives from the Canadian branch and the Toronto-based Xinghua Daily, Wang Guanying and Guan Zhushi, expressed their opinions to reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday regarding their return to the country to attend the Fourth National Congress and their thoughts after the Japanese invasion of Liaoning. They stated that when they were in the United States, they were deeply concerned upon hearing about the formation of a separate government in Guangdong, the rampant activities of the "Red bandits" in Hubei and Jiangxi, and the various difficulties caused by floods. Therefore, their greatest hope for this return to the country is the peace and unity of the nation. They hope that the comrades in Guangdong can treat each other with sincerity, so that they can unite internally, put politics on the right track, and jointly resist external aggression, thereby slightly curbing the ambitions of the enemy. As for all internal disputes within the party, they hope that they can be resolved by the public at the Fourth National Congress. Secondly, overseas Chinese, due to the impact of the global economic downturn, have seen their businesses abroad greatly affected, and many intend to invest in China to develop the country's industries. However, due to the ever-changing political situation in China and the failure to completely eliminate the "Red bandits," many are taking a wait-and-see approach. If China can be unified soon, it will surely attract enthusiastic investment from overseas compatriots. This is their second mission in returning to the country. In addition, overseas compatriots are even more eager for China to be unified soon because they are treated harshly by local countries due to China's weakness. They also stated that upon hearing the shocking news of the Japanese invasion of Liaoning, they conducted investigations in Japan and felt that the arrogance of the Japanese made people feel uncomfortable everywhere. What was particularly painful was that the Japanese newspapers propagated to their people that "there is no need to be surprised by the economic severance of relations with China; it will take no more than five minutes at most." At the same time, the Japanese told Chinese compatriots returning to China, "Why do you need to return to China? Japan can completely occupy China within three days and will definitely capture you and imprison you on the top of Mount Fuji." Therefore, their personal opinion is that to resist the Japanese, one must consider the root cause. They hope to reduce empty talk that does not contribute to the facts, so that everything done is practical work, and the greatest effect will be achieved in the final struggle.</p>
<h3>The Greater America Evening News</h3>
<p>Comments on Japan's Actions Towards China</p>
<p>They Are Truly Barbaric Means</p>
<p>They Are Truly the Means of a Mob</p>
<p>They Are Truly the Means of Brutal Beasts</p>
<p>The Greater America Evening News commented: "Our handling of cases, without weighing the circumstances or adhering to the law, acting rashly and imposing punishments directly, regardless of whether the punished is a genuine infringement or a perceived one, all constitute barbaric behavior. If a country resolves disputes with another country by acting as the plaintiff, judge, juror, and executor all in one, it poses a danger to the entire civilized world. This is the position Japan finds itself in today. It condones its military warlords, disregards its guarantees of peaceful arbitration, and brandishes its power against China. No one can doubt that Japan has many grievances against China, and other countries cannot be entirely unsympathetic to Japan's desire to resolve outstanding issues quickly. However, even with the most legitimate reasons, one cannot resort to erroneous actions. We witness Japan acting willfully, occupying Manchuria by force, bombing and shooting, using both guns and artillery, and seizing control of civil administration and the economy, while disregarding the instrument it had long signed with China, guaranteeing that both sides would abandon war as a means of resolving disputes. Our extreme disapproval of Japan is not about the fairness of its complaints against China, but about the imprudence and unfairness of the means it uses to resolve them. All civilized countries in the world prohibit individuals from retaliating against the suffering they have endured from their fellow human beings through violent means and instead first appeal to the state. Therefore, civilized countries also make solemn pledges that when disputes arise with other countries, they will propose peaceful arbitration before taking warlike action. Now, to insist that the occupation of Manchuria is limited to a corner of the region is both laughable and nonsensical. It must be understood that the stationing of Japanese troops on purely Chinese soil, which provokes Chinese suffering, cannot be confined to any one corner for long. Japan must also be aware of this. Once this kind of suffering and resentment erupts, it will be sufficient cause for war. Therefore, as an objective journalist, we maintain our position, as the principle of due legal process has already been recognized as the key to the happiness of the entire people of each country and as the key to civilization. Although the world sometimes fails to do so, only barbarians do not even follow it today, and only barbarians completely disregard it. Hasty retaliation is no longer tolerated in countries that pride themselves on civilization, just as it is not allowed among individuals in civilized countries. Therefore, we dare to assert that even if Japan's accusations against China are justified in three hundred cases, the means that Japan has used to seek justice are truly barbaric, truly the means of a mob, and truly the means of brutal beasts. They can only be implemented after the entire structure of civilization has been shattered."</p>
<h3>After Kang Baosen's Suicide</h3>
<p>The Proceeds from Selling His Clothes and Belongings</p>
<p>Are Entirely Used for the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Fund</p>
<p>Kang Baosen, a native of Liaoning Province, was 25 years old and served as a second lieutenant platoon leader in the sixth company of the second battalion of the third infantry regiment of the Ministry of Finance's Tax Police Corps. During the recent invasion of Chinese territory by violent Japan, as foreign aggression intensified, he felt that the country was being destroyed and the family was being ruined, and that it was better to die for the country than to live a meaningless life. Therefore, his usual remarks were exceptionally慷慨激昂, and he always wanted to fight a desperate battle with the Japanese, but he was limited by the current environment and could not fulfill his wish. Full of righteous indignation and unable to express his accumulated resentment, he suddenly took a Mauser pistol at 2 PM on the seventh of this month, when no one was paying attention, and fired a shot at his head. When the officers and soldiers of the company heard the sound and rushed over, he had already fallen to the ground, bleeding from his head, which was extremely tragic. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters immediately dispatched a car to send him to the Chinese Red Cross for help, but his injuries were severe, and he died at 5 PM that afternoon. He left behind three notes, one expressing his grief over the impending demise of the country and urging the people to strive for self-salvation, the second instructing people to sell his clothes and belongings after his death and use all the proceeds for the anti-Japanese national salvation fund, and the third providing the contact address of his family. After his death, all the officers and soldiers of the entire battalion were filled with resentment and shed tears, filled with righteous indignation, vowing to repay the country with sincere iron blood and loyalty to comfort the heroic soul of Martyr Kang. Commander Xiong has now issued 200 yuan for burial expenses, and Battalion Commander Han Buqing has dispatched Company Commander Mei Jie and several platoon leaders to collect the body and transport it to the Jilu Villa on Jinyi Road for temporary storage. The officers and soldiers of the regiment plan to hold a memorial service at the public sports field on the 12th.</p>

<p>Committing Suicide Out of Grief and Indignation Over Violent Japan</p>
<p>Leaving Behind a Suicide Note After Jumping into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Hoping that People Can Identify His Appearance and Clothing in Haste</p>
<p>At about 6 PM the night before last, the No. 1 ferry boat at the Xinkuan Wharf on Hankou Road</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>was carrying about 20 passengers to the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong. Unexpectedly, when the boat reached the center of the river, a middle-aged man suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River and committed suicide. The crew members tried desperately to rescue him, but he had already sunk to the bottom of the river and was forever with the river god. Only a newspaper, an anti-Japanese aggression alert, and a letter were left on the boat (with the address "No. 13, Xiangshun Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, Zhao Yuncan, etc." written on it). The boat boss, Shen Heshang, was unable to rescue him and had no choice but to send the belongings to the water patrol station, explaining the circumstances of the deceased's jump into the river and saying that in the haste, he could not discern his appearance or clothing. The original text of his suicide note is copied below: "To the captain of the boat, I am truly sorry for committing suicide by jumping off your boat. Thank you. The reason for my suicide is purely because national difficulties are imminent, and I myself have no ability to save the country and am unworthy of being a citizen. After my death, please, sir, give me the merit of salvaging my body, and you will surely have high hopes in the future. Please." Upon reading it, the Chinese officers of the patrol station were all filled with regret. Even the Westerners recognized that he had acted out of patriotic impulse. The patrol station has now ordered investigators to investigate the deceased's family so that people can be sent to salvage the deceased's body.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Convened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Financial Stability Meeting</p>
<p>Decided that Various Government Bonds Would Be Purchased by Various Banks as Much as Possible; Restrictions on Spot Deliveries at the Exchange Would Be Lifted</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen convened a meeting with the banking community in Shanghai yesterday at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance. Representatives from 18 banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Bank, Yanye Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Continental Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Shanghai Bank, China Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, Zhongfu Bank, Tongshang Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Guohuo Bank, Kenye Bank, Xingye Bank, and Guohua Bank, attended. Finance Minister Song Ziwen chaired the meeting, reported on the purpose of convening the meeting, and the necessity of maintaining government bonds. After a long discussion by the representatives, they all agreed that maintaining the price of government bonds was the best way to stabilize the financial situation. Although the banks had previously released a loan of 15 million, there was still a surplus at present. However, when necessary, the banks should still lend as much as possible and purchase from the exchanges and banks as much as possible. On the other hand, the Ministry of Finance was requested to approve the cancellation of the restrictions on spot deliveries if the exchanges requested it, so that merchants could trade as much as possible. Song expressed his approval of this point. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency specifically visited Vice Minister of Finance Zhang Shouyong regarding the Ministry of Finance's maintenance of government bonds. According to Zhang, the credit of various government bonds in China was originally very good, but the market situation fluctuated due to the Japanese taking the opportunity to cause trouble and merchants engaging in speculation. The Ministry of Finance had always paid great attention to maintaining government bonds. This meeting was an internal matter. It has now been decided that the banks will purchase as much as possible, and the market situation should stabilize. The peace negotiations between Nanjing and Guangdong have already yielded results. As for the Japanese warships coming to China, although their nature contains a demonstrative meaning, Shanghai is an international trading port, and Japan would never dare to risk the disapproval of the world and start a war lightly. He sincerely hopes that all merchants in Shanghai will remain calm, and the financial market can also be stable. As for the Ministry of Finance maintaining government bonds, it will always be responsible, no matter how bad the country gets.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Department Orders Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>To Resolve Labor-Management Disputes</p>
<p>Labor and Management Unite to Overcome National Difficulties</p>
<p>Disputes Have Gradually Decreased</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a notice to various trade associations and labor unions, stating that Japan is relying on its strength to invade China and commit aggression against our country. All Chinese people should unite and make every effort to fight against foreign aggression to save the country from danger. During this period, all industries and businesses in the city should be vigilant in their responsibilities to share the same boat and not engage in labor-management disputes that lead to infighting. Those that have already occurred must be resolved within two weeks of the date of the notice. As for those who intend to propose new conditions that have not been proposed, they should also be postponed to ensure that labor and management are united to overcome national difficulties. In addition to distributing and sending letters to the Social Affairs Bureau for reference, it is hereby urgently ordered that all industrial and commercial organizations in the city must comply with this order without fail. The industrial and commercial sectors in the city, in view of the national crisis, are reducing the already occurred labor-management disputes in order to seek unity against foreign aggression after receiving the notice from the Special Municipal Party Department and preparing to comply with the order and find ways to resolve them. For example, silk weaving workers, who originally proposed to improve treatment conditions, have now decided at the general meeting to postpone their proposals in order to unite labor and management to overcome national difficulties. According to the Municipal Party Department, labor-management disputes have decreased compared to before after violent Japan occupied the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Department Holds a Commemorative Meeting</h3>
<p>On the Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Peril in London</p>
<p>October 11 is the 35th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's perilous situation in London. The Municipal Executive Committee decided to hold a commemorative meeting at 10 AM that morning in the auditorium of the Municipal Party Department. It has already sent letters to various agencies, groups, schools, and party departments at all levels, inviting them to send representatives to participate. Shen Gongzhan was appointed as the chairman, and Chen Kecheng will give a speech. It is expected that there will be a passionate and solemn ceremony at that time.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Will Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>To Go to Hong Kong and Liaise With the Guangdong Side for Peace</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu, who is going to Hong Kong to liaise with the Guangdong side for peace, first left Hong Kong and returned to Beijing to report on his mission. He has already taken the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhiliwang Wheel to Shanghai with two entourages. It was originally scheduled to enter the port this morning, but yesterday the shipping company received a telegram saying that the Zhiliwang was slightly delayed due to its lower speed, and the voyage would be delayed until 9 AM tomorrow (Double Tenth Day). It is expected to arrive at the Blue Funnel Wharf. As a result, Chen Mingshu's arrival in Shanghai has also been delayed by one day. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has prepared a small passenger launch to Pudong to take passengers to the Xinkuan Wharf to disembark.</p>
<h3>Report of the Peace Petition Representatives</h3>
<p>Hu Shuhua, Ye Huijun, Wang Hanliang, and Secretary Xue Guangqian, who went to Guangdong as peace petition representatives, reported the situation of the petition to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday. In addition to the situation of the liaison in Hong Kong, which has been briefly described in the letter from the road, the following is a brief summary: On the afternoon of September 30, they departed from Hong Kong to Guangzhou and arrived late. The next morning, they met with Tang Shaocuan, Gu Yingfen, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, and other important figures. The representatives expressed the pain of the current foreign aggression and national crisis. All parties in the country should abandon their previous grudges and prejudices, and unite with one heart and one mind to save the country from danger. If they continue to hold different opinions and do not seek effective cooperation with the central government, they will surely lose the national hope. Tang and others were deeply moved. The representatives stated that Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Chen Mingshu, Zhang Ji, and other gentlemen from the central government were actively consulting with the Guangdong side and working hard to mediate the meeting several times, and their opinions had gradually converged. Peaceful unification could be realized concretely in the shortest possible time. The representatives then visited the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Sun Yat-sen University, and various mass organizations to liaise with them and unite them in the peace movement, urging the authorities to seek unification as soon as possible to comfort the people. They returned to Hong Kong on the 13th and set off for Shanghai on the 4th. The journey took 10 days. All the unfinished situations are continued as above. Please approve it.</p>
<h3>Zheng Hong's Telegram to Dai Jitao</h3>
<p>Please Accommodate the Guangdong Side's Request</p>
<p>To Escort Hu Hanmin to Shanghai</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, Comrade of the Nanjing Examination Yuan: I have heard reliably that the Guangdong comrades requested to escort Mr. Hu to Shanghai. The Guangdong comrades will come to Shanghai unconditionally to discuss the overall situation. This is truly a great turning point in the great unity and unification of our party. Today, the party and the country are in extreme danger. The abolition of political tutelage and the abolition of party rule have been clamoring in the mouths of the general public, and the intellectual class and the backbone of society, who are close to the people, have become an open secret for the government to laugh in their sleeves. Do you and the comrades know this? At this time, comrades with a history in our party should immediately unite, seek forgiveness from the people, and work with the people to overcome national difficulties. Only then can our party restore its credibility. At this time, the only key is for Mr. Hu to come to Shanghai. If you can mediate and let Mr. Hu come to Shanghai, then our party's great unity will be achieved soon, and the overall situation will have a solution. I deeply believe that Mr. Hu will be able to join hands with General Jiang to maintain the overall situation. I am willing to guarantee with my personality and life. If you have any doubts, I will come to Nanjing after Mr. Hu arrives in Shanghai and wait for the government to supervise me. Comrades of our party have struggled for decades, and how many are left? In terms of personality and knowledge, only you and Mr. Hu. The Premier is the national father, and Mr. Hu is trusted by the national father. The classics say that what parents love, one should also love. You and I train young people with loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love every day, but we cannot do our best to restore Mr. Hu's freedom. We are truly ashamed. We have nothing to comfort the spirit of the Premier in heaven. When I was in Nanjing, I often visited Mr. Hu and talked with him wildly about old times in his youth, hoping to comfort him. However, although Mr. Hu tried to maintain his composure, his spirit often revealed a hidden pain without him realizing it. Mr. Hu is extremely heartbroken, and some people still say that Mr. Hu does not want to leave Nanjing. Must Mr. Hu be depressed to the end? Otherwise, why would Mr. Hu say this? What has Mr. Hu done to harm the party and the country that he must be placed in this extreme situation? Is this how to assist Mr. Jiang and love Mr. Jiang? The decline of righteousness and the end of the party and the country. We have nothing to face the Premier. We are sinners of China. The people cannot forgive us. I have been engaged in the revolution since the end of the Qing Dynasty and have been struggling for more than twenty years. Although I served as an official in the Northern Court, I was actually working for the party. Comrades with a history in the party all know this and can say it. When I returned in my later years, the Premier loved and trusted me deeply. On his deathbed, he still murmured words of comfort. Seeing the country destroyed and the party ruined, I felt even more pain than any other comrade. Writing this, I do not know where my tears should come from. Your brother Zheng Hong's age.</p>
<h3>Party Members</h3>
<p>Wang Zhisheng and Others Call for Peace</p>
<p>Telegrams Sent to Beijing and Guangdong Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Zhisheng, Wu Qiyu, and 114 other party members in the city telegraphed Beijing and Guangdong yesterday, saying: "To Jiang Jieshi, Hu Zhantang, Guo Fu, Dai Jitao, He Jingzhi, Ding Weifen, Ye Chuyu, Chen Lifu, Yu Youren, Li Renchao, Zhu Peide, Ju Juesheng in Nanjing, and Wang Jingwei, Sun Zhesheng, Tang Shaocuan, Gu Xiangqin Bonan, Li Delin, Deng Zheru, Zhang Xianghua, Xiao Focheng, Ma Chaojun, Chen Youren, and Tang Shengzhi in Guangzhou: We respectfully think that you are all founding heroes of the Republic of China and pillars of our party. In the past, due to differences in political views, you took different paths midway. Although it was unfortunate for the party and the country, you also sought the peace of mind of your ambitions. Zhisheng and others also hold different opinions and pursue different paths, willing to see it through to the end and die for it. But now violent Japan is trampling on our eastern province, and justice is extinct in the world. Without uniting the power of the whole country, how can there be a way to save the country? Democratic republic was created by our party, but after governing for several years, it is almost impossible to avoid becoming the sinners of the country's demise. If the Premier has a spirit, will he not cry bitterly under the Nine Springs? Zhisheng and others, as party members, witness the difficulties of the times and find it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we earnestly express our sincere thoughts and earnestly ask you to abandon your suspicions and unite to overcome national difficulties. On the one hand, concentrate your talents and wisdom to build the country, and on the other hand, prepare for war against Japan and recover the lost territories. The future of the party and the country is deeply reliant. We are waiting for orders in anticipation. Koutou reported by Kuomintang members Wang Zhisheng, Wu Qiyu, Zhang Jundui, Zhu Chengzhi, Li Qiaozhi, Li Dacheng, Huang Zengqi, Wang Anpu, Bian Liangdu, Chen Da, Huang Nanxi, Ouyang Wu, Gao Shuren, Gao Zhan, Xu Xiaoru, Zhang Bangcheng, Liang Jiaxun, Xie Zhongren, Jiang Rushan, Ji Shuxuan, Sun Dacheng, Hou Zhaocong, Chen Jialian, Wu Chongren, Xu Wenxiang, Zhou Junchang, Sun Qiutao, Gu Zhonghuai, Gu Jialian, and 114 others, and publicly recommending representatives Wang Zhisheng, Wu Qiyu, Zhang Jundui, Zhu Chengzhi, and five others to go to Guangdong to petition."</p>

He expressed his deep regret for this. His wife's eyes were swollen like peaches from crying for days. It is said that when Lindbergh arrives in Nagasaki, he will take a train to Yokohama on the same day and then take the American mail ship Jackson President back to the United States. As for Lindbergh's plane left in Shanghai, it will be transported to the United States by China Aviation Corporation.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Social Affairs Pays Attention to Counterfeit National Products</h3>
<p>Verification and Certification Starting From October 1st</p>
<p>Our country's production is backward, and foreign goods are rampant. It is impossible to revitalize the industry without supporting the products of domestic goods manufacturers. And merchants often use foreign goods to impersonate domestic brands in an attempt to make profits, which is especially hateful. Therefore, the Bureau of Social Affairs ordered the National Goods Exhibition Hall to prepare measures for the certification of domestic goods, conduct thorough investigations, and submit them for approval. Yesterday, the museum received instructions stating: "The submission has been received and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been ordered to forward it to all trade associations for notification, and letters have been sent to the Public Security Bureau and newspapers for reference." The implementation plan for its certification is divided into: (1) Starting from October 1st of this year, the certification of domestic goods in the Shanghai urban area will be handled by the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition Hall. (2) All domestic goods manufacturers that have been certified by various agencies and organizations should immediately submit their certification documents to the National Goods Exhibition Hall for filing and verification and will be issued a certificate. (3) The newspapers will be informed that advertisements for all brands that have not been certified by the National Goods Exhibition Hall will not be allowed to use the words "National Goods" to prevent confusion.</p>
<h3>French Concession</h3>

The meeting started at 7 PM. Captain Wang Shunfa was elected as the chairman, and he reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that the group has been suspended for two years since Commander Wei left office due to the lack of a person in charge. This group is a group with a glorious history, and it is not appropriate to suspend it for a long time. This is to call on everyone to discuss it together. As a result of the meeting, a restoration committee was organized, named the French Concession Chinese Volunteer Corps Restoration Movement Committee, to carry out all restoration matters, and sent letters to the French Concession Taxpayer's Association and sent a document to the French Consul General Koglin and Police Chief Fervault, asking them to immediately appoint people with prestige in the concession, so that the group's duties could be restored immediately, so that the group's past spirit could be perpetuated, and the security of the concession could also be greatly assisted. At the time of the meeting, it was raining heavily, and all the members came in the rain, and their spirit of fearlessness was admirable.</p>

<h3>Grain and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Foreign Rice Issues</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grain, Miscellaneous Grain, Oil and Cake Trade Association issued a notice to the members of the same industry yesterday, stating that the association convened the 19th meeting of the first executive committee the other day. Regarding the case of Changmaohao asking to discuss the dumping of foreign rice from Taihe Foreign Company, it was decided that if the foreign rice could be declared and shipped immediately, the buyer should accept it. If the declaration and shipment could not be made by the 13th, the seller should still be responsible. After the 13th, the buyer will be responsible. The certificate of the British Consul of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs will be temporarily kept by the association. However, this case is actually a current issue in the same industry's buying and selling. The association should propose various methods regarding this type of issue and ask the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for accurate instructions for compliance. In addition to asking the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the case is hereby recorded and announced, and I hope that all colleagues will be informed.</p>
<h3>The Postal Remittance Bureau Adds Two Types of Savings</h3>
<p>Lump-Sum Deposit and Interest-Bearing Deposit</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the deposits received from public organizations and individuals have been nearly 10 million yuan in less than two years. The bureau's new savings include three types: current account, branch ticket, fixed deposit, and passbook. Now, in order to meet social needs and facilitate the public, it is said that two types of lump-sum deposit and interest-bearing deposit have been added. The procedures are simple, and the interest is generous. The bureau and various post offices have detailed regulations for depositors to read.</p>
<h3>National Products Samples to be Displayed in Korea</h3>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association, due to the imposition of heavy taxes on Chinese goods by Japan, leading to a yearly decrease in the transportation of national products to Korea, a situation that has plummeted drastically. If no measures are taken to promote them, it will be difficult to restore the former state. Therefore, this summer, taking advantage of the return to China of the former Consul-General to Korea, Zhang Weicheng, the association specially collected over a hundred kinds of the latest exquisite national products to be carried to Korea, where a national products exhibition hall would be specially opened, with items classified and displayed, in order to attract the attention of overseas Chinese in Korea and Korean people. After the goods were shipped to Korea, it coincided with the occurrence of a major tragedy, and Consul-General Zhang left office. The association then sent a letter inquiring about the current location of the goods and how they were to be arranged. Recently, they received letter No. 34 from the Consulate-General in Korea, which stated: "Regarding your association's letter No. 7224, due to the sudden outbreak of anti-Chinese riots in Korea, we were busy with negotiations and handling the aftermath, which led to a temporary postponement of the national products sample exhibition. The newly appointed Consul-General Lu will be arriving soon, and all the aforementioned goods samples will be transferred to the successor for proper handling. This letter is to inform you, and we hope you will take note and pass this information on to the China National Products Maintenance Association."</p>
<h3>Fire at Shangwen Road</h3>
<p>Also, Three Children Missing</p>
<p>Unknown if They Perished in the Flames</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 3:45 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the upstairs residence of Wang Ligui, a Zhenjiang native who deals in imitation jadeite, located at No. 5 Renfuli, Shangwen Road, Nanshi. In an instant, the fire spread rapidly. Moreover, due to the strong easterly wind at the time, although fire trucks from the northwest and west districts of the Fire Brigade were dispatched to fight the fire, the effect was minimal, and it spread to the houses on the left and opposite, engulfing more than ten houses. It wasn't until 5:30 AM, nearly two hours later, that the fire was finally extinguished. Firefighter No. 68 from the North District Fire Brigade fell from the upper floor and suffered serious injuries. Director Xia from the West District also suffered minor injuries. Both were sent to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. At the time, the police chief of the Second Sub-Bureau of the two districts arrived at the scene to maintain order. Wang Ligui, the fire's originator, and Liu Weizhi, who lived downstairs, both fled in fear of being held responsible. Consequently, Wang's wife, Zhang, was taken to the sub-bureau. After a brief interrogation by the chief, she confessed to being 34 years old and from Zhenjiang, directly admitting that the fire had started, but the reason was that a fellow villager named Chang Jinzi had come from Zhenjiang to Shanghai and was staying at their place. It was probably that Yang carelessly threw a cigarette butt onto easily flammable, tattered cotton wadding, resulting in this misfortune. However, there are still three children missing, and it is unknown whether they perished in the flames. According to the chief's report, he immediately prepared a document to submit to the general bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Scavenging Woman Crushed to Death by Car</h3>
<p>A young woman from Jiangbei, Zhou Xu, approximately in her thirties, made a living by scavenging. Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, while scavenging in the Bund area outside Sima Road, a freight truck drove up from behind. The concession registration number was 17019. Because it was driving too fast, she was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, suffering crushing injuries to her head, waist, and other areas, and her right foot was broken. She was on the verge of death. Subsequently, two Chinese constables, No. 940 and No. 214, from the Central Police Station arrived and impounded the truck at the police station for punishment. The injured person was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, but unfortunately, her injuries were too severe, and she died half an hour after arriving at the hospital. The body was then transferred by the hospital to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Shi Hongxun and Others Resign from City Federation Branch</h3>
<p>Shi Hongxun, Wu Zifan, Qi Sheng, and others, executive committee members of the 23rd branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, previously requested to resign from their positions on the 23rd executive committee of the Jin branch due to being overwhelmed with matters. The City Federation replied with a letter of retention, urging Shi and others to make an effort to continue. After the resignation of Shi and others, considering the current national crisis, they should have complied with the reply and returned to their posts. However, due to the concerns of their own businesses and being burdened with work, they truly had no spare time to serve as executive committee members of the branch. Rather than causing delays in the future, it would be better to resign first to give way to more capable individuals. Therefore, they sent another letter to the City Federation a few days ago, earnestly requesting permission to resign.</p>

<h3>Disaster Relief News</h3>
<p>Suzhou Flood Relief Association and Others</p>
<p>Request Allocation of Six Million in Disaster Relief Public Bonds</p>
<p>The association recently sent a telegram to the Central Disaster Relief Committee, along with the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, the Jiangsu Provincial Disaster Relief Association, and the Jiangbei Flood Relief Temporary Relief Association, requesting the allocation of six million yuan in disaster relief public bonds for relief. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the Shanghai National Government Disaster Relief Committee, we respectfully report that this year's flood in Jiangsu Province has affected fifty counties. The number of disaster victims is nearly ten million, the area is vast, and the situation is truly unprecedented in a century. We have repeatedly telegraphed appeals, and we trust that this has reached your attention. However, in the past two months, official relief and charitable relief have raised at most one million yuan in total from all sources. When distributed to various counties, even those with more funds received only thirty to forty thousand yuan. We have repeatedly received requests for relief from various areas, stating that the funds previously allocated only benefit each disaster victim with a few jiao, and those counties awaiting relief continue to send telegrams requesting assistance. Unfortunately, the relief funds raised by our association and others have already been fully allocated, and there is nothing left to respond with. Moreover, the number of people coming and going to various shelters has been no less than several hundred thousand. Among them, the elderly and weak who are helpless, unable to advance and unable to retreat, still number more than forty thousand as of now. Each person in the shelter needs one jiao worth of food per day, and each shelter is expected to operate for four months, which requires no less than five to six hundred thousand yuan. In addition, there are still the majority of disaster victims in the disaster areas who are desperately clinging to their homes, hoping that after the flood recedes, they can engage in winter farming. However, it is expected that it will be difficult for the accumulated water to recede completely in the shortest period. When the cold wind rises, they will have neither clothing nor food, and those in the countryside will inevitably flock to the shelters, competing for supplies. The number of people will be ten times greater than today, crying from hunger and cold, a truly pitiful situation. We cannot bear to drive them away, nor can we support them for a long time. Therefore, we must make preparations for lending seeds, pledging cattle, repairing houses, and providing clothing. Sitting and watching all these things, we cannot come up with a plan. Therefore, on the first day of this month, our association and others convened a joint meeting, discussed in detail, and proposed to resubmit the case of requesting the issuance of six million yuan in disaster relief public bonds, based on the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association's telegram of the previous month, in the name of the joint meeting. This is truly because we recognize the severity of the disaster in Jiangsu Province and the eagerness with which various places await relief. If there are no large amounts of funds for assistance, all the disaster victims will inevitably face the prospect of starting to live and ending up dying. Therefore, we once again jointly send a telegram to earnestly request that you examine the previous case and approve the allocation of six million yuan from the disaster relief public bond funds, so as to thoroughly relieve the disaster, broadly prepare for the aftermath, and assist the Central Government's supreme intention of universal love and benevolence. This is our most sincere prayer. We await your command, and we eagerly anticipate your reply."</p>
<p>Canal Project Association</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Establish a Deliberative Council Quickly</h3>
<p>The Disaster Relief Association stationed in Zhen, Yancheng, Taizhou, and Dongtai, which is concerned about the breach in the canal embankment, has repeatedly expressed its views. Now, it is sending a telegram to the Canal Project Rehabilitation Committee, requesting that it convene a deliberative council quickly and amend the committee's organizational outline. The original text is recorded as follows: "To the Jiangsu Jiangbei Canal Project Rehabilitation Committee, the canal embankment has been breached for forty days, and your committee has been established for nearly a month. There is still no date for the closure of the breach and the interruption of the flow. How the various sections of the project will be rehabilitated, we have not heard anything about it. We have repeatedly received telegrams from various counties inquiring about the situation, and it is difficult to answer. We believe that your committee's previous resolution to establish a deliberative council was also because it recognized that it is inappropriate to be deeply closed and firmly rejected. It is better to be open and fair to gain wider hearing. We deeply rejoice in this. We propose that you convene the meeting quickly to dispel doubts and comfort public opinion. However, the original organizational outline regarding the deliberative council's powers only allows it to accept project reports and review income and expenditure. These are all ex post facto recognitions, and it does not grant the power to agree to the engineering plan beforehand. It seems that it has not yet reached perfection. Whether it should be revised further, we propose that you rule on it together. Disaster Relief Association stationed in Zhen, Yancheng, Taizhou, and Dongtai. "</p>

<h3>Bao Long Hospital</h3>
<p>Whether Negligence of Duty</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Death of Cheng Xiechun's Eldest Son</p>
<p>A Letter Requesting Public Judgment from Various Important Organizations</p>
<p>Cheng Xiechun, the owner of the Shanghai Xie Ji Bookstore, sent letters to various important organizations in Shanghai yesterday, stating: "I respectfully report that my eldest son, Jingan, was hospitalized and treated at Bao Long Hospital on Baker Road, Shanghai, due to illness, but he died due to negligence. The circumstances are as follows: On September 18 of this year, I accompanied him into the hospital. According to the hospital doctor's diagnosis, it was tuberculous peritonitis and pneumonia. He was X-rayed once and sunlamped twice. During the second sunlamp treatment, the person in charge of the sunlamp left the patient under the sunlamp to have lunch. The patient waited for a long time and did not return. Due to excessive heat, he could no longer bear it and had to forcibly rise from the bed and turn off the sunlamp himself. On September 28, the hospital performed surgery on the patient without seeking my consent or signature. The anesthesia was incomplete, causing the patient to scream, struggle, and bleed profusely, and his spirit suddenly declined. After the operation, no doctor or nurse from the hospital attended to the patient or prepared for immediate remedy, causing the patient to die unfortunately. I am writing to request a public judgment on whether this kind of action by the hospital constitutes negligence of duty and leads to death. I would be very grateful if you would uphold justice."</p>
<h3>Three Days After the Wedding</h3>
<p>Only to Find Out She Was Someone's Concubine</p>
<p>The Seventeen-Year-Old Bride Could Only Sob</p>
<p>Yu Qiusheng Insisted That What's Done is Done</p>
<p>Both Parties Have Now Filed Lawsuits Separately</p>
<p>The Location of the Marriage Still Needs Investigation</p>
<p>Yu Qiusheng, the owner of the Dade Rubber Factory, is over forty years old and has been married for many years. This summer, he suddenly had the absurd idea of taking a concubine. However, taking a concubine is not only not allowed by law, but a girl from a good family is even more unwilling to commit herself to such matters. Therefore, he falsely claimed that his wife had died and, for the sake of descendants, held a second wedding, asking people to search everywhere for a beautiful woman to fill the lower ranks. Thus, a woman from Shaoxing named Wang, who lived in Xinkang Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha, was fooled by matchmakers and agreed to marry her seventeen-year-old daughter to Yu. The wedding was set for July 23. The groom's residence specially rented the New World Hotel as the wedding hall, while the bride's residence rented the Hongxiang Hotel as the departure point. When the auspicious day arrived, Yu used a procession of a hundred cars decorated with ribbons to welcome the bride, and he asked Ms. Wang Linzhu and Ms. Wang Qiaoxian to accompany the bride. Although there was no drum music, the red candles burned high, and they replaced the traditional bowing with mutual bows. After the ceremony, they feasted and entertained guests, and the bridal chamber was at No. 9 Tongde Lane, Zilai Street, French Concession. Three days later, Yu said to the bride, "Now, there are relatives who have prepared a banquet, would you like to come with me?" The bride did not know what it was for and happily went with him. At No. 66 Zhangchuan Lane in the city, she met a middle-aged woman whom Yu introduced as his sister, ordering the bride to address her as "Sister." After the banquet, the bride wanted to go home, but Yu and the middle-aged woman both stopped her. Soon, all the appliances in the Tongde Lane bridal chamber were completely moved to the middle-aged woman's house, and a separate room was prepared for the bride. Seeing this situation, the bride felt as if she had fallen into a fog. At night, the bride was alone in the deep boudoir, waiting for Yu to arrive. When she asked others, they all said that he was sleeping with his sister. Only then did she realize that what he called his sister was actually a disguised term for his wife. The bride knew this trickery, but with no relatives to rely on, she could only sob and cry. Yu and his wife were afraid that the bride would run away at night, and they watched her very closely, not allowing her to take a step beyond the boundary. When the honeymoon arrived, the bride's mother went to visit her beloved daughter. When they met, the daughter told her everything. The mother immediately took her daughter to the Dade Rubber Factory's office and accused Yu of not cheating on the marriage. Yu, having achieved his goal, said to his mother-in-law, "What's done is done now. It's useless to argue. You should advise your daughter to be content with her life." Hearing his words, Wang felt that Yu was too deceitful and could not tolerate it. Therefore, on the 26th of last month, she took her daughter and hired a lawyer to send a letter to the Public Concession Police Station, requesting to report him according to law to uphold ethics. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, then filed a public prosecution against Yu Qiusheng for bigamy based on Article 254 of the Criminal Law. While this was in progress, Yu also hired a lawyer to accuse Wang's daughter of running away with money to the French Concession Police Station. The case was once tried by the Second Special District Court of the French Concession and adjourned to be heard again on the 14th of this month. Yesterday morning, Feng Shide, a judge of the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court of the Public Concession, opened the court to hear the bigamy case filed by the police station. First, the police station's lawyer stated the circumstances of the case. The defendant's lawyer argued that this case should also be transferred to the French Concession for joint trial, while the plaintiff's lawyer expressed opposition. Then, the bride testified about the location of the marriage, saying that she only lived in the French Concession for three days after the marriage before moving to the city. The police station also summoned Zhou Shunjin, an employee of the New World Hotel, to the stand to prove the circumstances of the marriage. However, Zhou's testimony was quite evasive. The defendant also insisted that he only held a banquet at the hotel and did not formally marry. Finally, Judge Feng stated that the jurisdiction of this case should be determined by the location of the marriage. Where the marriage was actually held still needs to be investigated. Therefore, this issue cannot be resolved yet. The defendant was ordered to pay a security deposit of two thousand yuan, and the hearing was adjourned to the 15th of this month after the investigation is clear.</p>
<h3>Incense Burning and Candle Lighting at Xia Hai Temple</h3>
<p>Bandits Prayed for Divine Protection</p>
<p>Hoping to Kill Two People and Rob Their Clothes and Ornaments</p>
<p>Hoping the Case Would Never Be Solved</p>
<p>Ma Er Had Torn Clothes as Evidence</p>
<p>Heaven's Net is Vast, But Nothing Escapes Its Mesh</p>
<p>Late at night on the 19th of last month, Gu Cao, the aunt-in-law of Zhu Yangshan, and Zhou Lu, a maidservant, at the home of Zhu Yangshan above the Yichang Electrical Company at 196 Dong Xi Hua De Road, were suddenly murdered by bandits, and clothes and ornaments worth 1,038 yuan were robbed. Cai Zhitian, a Chinese detective of the Huishan Police Station, arrested Ma Er, a suspect from Tongzhou, and handed him over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. He denied the charges and was detained for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong sat in the Third Criminal Court to continue the hearing. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that during the adjournment, the defendant confessed the details to the police station. The defendant in this case was the driver of Cai Detective. Previously, Cai Detective searched for a white cloth shirt abandoned by the murderer at the scene of the murder of the victims Gu and Zhou. It had blood stains on it, and the pocket on the shirt was patched. Cai Detective carefully examined the pocket of the white cloth shirt worn by the driver Ma Er on a daily basis, and it also had traces of patching, with similar dimensions and length. When asked about it, he took out the same shirt for inspection and vehemently denied it. However, Ma was highly suspected in this case, so he was brought to trial. Later, a fellow worker proved that the bloody shirt was indeed Ma Er's, and there was another slight tear at the button. It was what he used to wear in the past. Therefore, Cai Detective and the Western detective re-interrogated him at the police station, and he finally confessed that the case was initiated by a certain A and other three fugitives. They knew that the victim's family had a savings of 500 yuan in cash and that only two women were taking care of the house, making it easier to plan. Therefore, on the evening of the 17th of this month, at around 9:00 PM, they had a meal at a small restaurant near Longqing Lane and spent two yuan discussing it. They decided to carry it out and went to Xia Hai Temple in Yangshupu to burn incense and light candles, praying for divine protection to prevent the case from being solved. If they were arrested, they would not betray their accomplices and would rather be sacrificed alone, swearing solemn oaths. That night, they went to the restaurant again for a big meal and drank heavily. At around 1:00 AM, armed with knives and flashlights, they entered through the rear door of the house by climbing over the wall from a dark place. First, A pried open the door and they entered together. The defendant broke into the bedroom of the maidservant Zhou Lu, and she woke up and shouted for a robber. The defendant, in desperation, stabbed Zhou's head, abdomen, and other parts with a knife, killing her instantly. Blood gushed out like a spring. The defendant picked up old cloth nearby and covered it with it. A and others entered Gu Cao's room, trying to take out the 500 yuan in banknotes, but they failed and were also stabbed to death with knives. The maidservant Zhou Lu was only wearing a short shirt at the time and had no pants. Whether she was raped by these people beforehand is unknown. Afterwards, the defendant's accomplices grabbed clothes and ornaments and escaped. In the morning, they went to a pawnshop on Zhaofeng Road and pawned them, etc. The defendant received five yuan the first time and fifty yuan the second time. The defendant's confession, the shirt found in the broken cloth in the house, and a knife were presented for inspection and requested to be postponed. Ma Er firmly denied that the shirt belonged to him and said that the confession at the police station was not voluntary and was made up. He asked the court to be lenient and repeatedly cried out for injustice. After Judge Shen verified the confession, he ordered him to be returned to custody and adjourned the hearing for another day.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs</h3>
<p>Inspection of Factories in the Concession</p>

<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that after the factory inspectors of the Bureau of Social Affairs inspected factories in the International Settlement, the Western-organized Employers' Federation sent a letter to the Municipal Council with inquiries. Today, the Municipal Council issued a statement saying that this action was not a formal factory inspection according to the Factory Act.

<h3>Mr. Wu Shouchi’s News (Written For. Side. Hear. Propaganda.)</h3>
<p>Upon hearing that the Japanese had forcibly occupied our Northeast, all people in the country were filled with righteous indignation, beating their chests and drinking blood. In particular, the ardent and fervent young students have organized petition groups, volunteer corps, and propaganda and lecture teams. For a time, the spirit of saving the country was truly admirable. One day, while I was returning from visiting a friend, I happened to see a propaganda team of students from a certain school lecturing to a rural villager. The lecturer was a handsome young man, dressed in a beautiful Western suit, his hair slicked back and shiny. When he spoke, all the villagers listened attentively. One listener, holding a hoe, with a bare, dark body, seemed to have come straight from the fields after work, deep in thought. After the student finished his speech, the villager said with emotion, "Since Japan has occupied our country, the only method for us Chinese people is to boycott Japanese goods. But you students can only talk but not act. Look at the clothes you are wearing now, aren't they Japanese goods? You propagandists buy Japanese goods and use Japanese goods, yet you dare to preach to others not to buy or use them? We ourselves wear homespun cloth and use homemade goods. We don't need you to tell us not to buy Japanese goods. We have never bought them. Those who are afraid to buy, it's still you, you better start by advertising to yourselves!” His words were impassioned, causing the propagandists of the team to blush and say nothing, turning away and leaving. Admirable, indeed, is this rural villager. Sent from Wusong, please publish in your esteemed newspaper.</p>
<p>(Reply) No matter what, if you advise others to do something, you must first do it yourself; if you advise others not to do something, you must first do it yourself. For the past two or thirty years, there have been too many people who speak nice words, but few who actually do, and even fewer who are willing to do it themselves first. The fact you reported can very well serve as a warning to people in all aspects, causing everyone to pay attention, not just to the matter of advocating not using Japanese goods.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ma Yuliang’s News (Asking. About. People's. Work. Against. Japan.)</h3>
<p>Currently, besides not using Japanese goods, advising the public not to use Japanese goods, joining the National Salvation Volunteer Corps, and propagating the brutal Japanese theft of our Eastern Provinces, what other things should our citizens be responsible for? Please, in your compassionate wisdom, publish an answer in the newspaper to comfort my patriotic heart.</p>
<p>(Reply) As a member of the Lishui business community, if you earnestly do the few things mentioned in your letter, I am afraid that you will already have done a lot of work and had a lot of influence. Speaking of things beyond that, there is one fundamental thing, which is that everyone must work harder in their respective positions. Officials, whether high or low, civil or military, should of course intensify their work. Even we ordinary people, farmers and workers, working harder can lead to a special increase in production; merchants working harder can lead to a double circulation of goods; students working harder in their studies can quickly improve their academic abilities; even we journalists are intensifying our work. If all the people in the country work harder together, production will especially increase, scientific research will be particularly advanced, and the operation of institutions will be particularly smooth. Everyone is willing to devote double the energy to fulfill their responsibilities. This is the foundation of a wealthy and strong country. I hope you will work hard, and we will all work hard.</p>

<h3>Words of Anguish</h3>
<p>— Dujuan</p>
<p>Beloved compatriots. It would be good if Japanese warships did not come. But the arrival of Japanese warships is also within expectations, so there is no need to panic. Because before they take off their masks, they always claim to be protecting their overseas residents. Let's just listen and remain calm, and see what tricks they pull. However, the self-preserving people of Zhabei, upon hearing that Japanese warships had entered the Wusongkou, and lightly believing some unconscious rumors, had already begun to flee in droves. In fact, they had not even seen a shadow of Japanese soldiers. Why the rush? To make the Japanese laugh at our cowardice. If the country truly falls, then no matter where you flee to, you will still be a subjugated people. What is there to cherish about your life and property?</p>

<h3>The Three-Character Classic of Love</h3>
<p>Before a person is born, the God of Love gives him or her a cup of love dew and says: "Take this cup of love dew and preserve it well. You can only drink it with the one you love the most!" This is Venus's command, and not a single word can be disobeyed. See how clear the words "only" and "most" are! If you only drink with the one you love the most, then the love dew is as sweet as honey; if you give it to anyone, it will turn into vinegar, into poison. Now, young people find love fascinating. I do not object. However, many young people treat lovers like Han Xin commanding soldiers: the more the better. They spend all day lingering in vinegar jars, cesspools, and poisonous gas chambers, forgetting their country, their studies, their careers, and their lives, ruining their reputations and regretting it too late. Last year, when Huang Baiying was forced to take poison by her lover, I wrote a Three-Character Classic to advise my young friends. Now I want to offer it to the young people of the whole country: "Happiness lies only in exclusive love!" The Three-Character Classic I wrote is: "Love's wine, sweet and bitter. Two people drink, it is nectar. Three people drink, it is sour like vinegar. If you drink it casually, it is poison among poisons." I wrote this Three-Character Classic, everyone must read it thoroughly!"</p>
<h3>A Page of Tragic History of Japan's Annexation of Korea</h3>
<p>— Zizai</p>
<p>The brutality of Japan's actions is arousing anger around the world. However, if we review the heartbreaking history of July 18th of the gengxu year, when Japan forcibly occupied Korea, we must awaken and contemplate. Since the conclusion of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the situation in Korea suddenly changed. Those with insight knew that this land was no longer to be enjoyed by the Li family. However, the Korean Emperor, deceived by Japan's sweet words and hidden daggers, was encouraged to seek independence, thinking it would be the basis for a secure foundation and the eternal imperial legacy of his descendants. To confirm this, he even added honorific titles to himself, saying: "Heavenly Fortune Initiates the Ultimate, Promoting Ethics, Correcting Sacredness, Radiating Righteousness, Manifesting Merit, Great Virtue, Yao-like Sublimity, Shun-like Magnificence, Yu-like Planning, Tang-like Reverence, Responding to Destiny, Governing Principles, Achieving Transformation, Divine Fierceness, Majestic Achievements, Great Enterprise, Initiating the Foundation, Proclaiming and Experiencing the Operation of Qian, Establishing the Stability of Kun, Heroic Brilliance, Great Rest, Grand Emperor." It was as long as forty-nine characters, truly like a fish in a pot, unaware of its impending doom. On the day that Japan forcibly occupied Korea, an Imperial Council was convened. On this day, Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan-yong, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Cho, Minister of Interior Park, representatives of the Imperial family, Prince Heung Lee Jae-myeon, Chairman of the Central Council Kim, and Japanese officials all gathered at the Injeongjeon Hall. Suddenly, the Korean Emperor, accompanied by attendant Yin and section chief Gao Lishi, appeared. The Korean traitor Lee Wan-yong stepped forward and reported: "Your Majesty, I observe the general trends of the world and the current state of Korea. For the benefit of the Korean people, it would be best to offer the land of Korea to Japan and receive its eternal protection. For the past few days, the cabinet ministers have carefully deliberated and dare to request Your Majesty's approval." At this time, the Korean Emperor closed his eyes and frowned. After a long while, he said, "I understand what you have reported. Handle everything according to your judgment." After speaking, tears streamed down his face. Most of the civil and military officials in the hall, except for those who had been informed in advance, were saddened. Thus, the fate of Korea was exhausted. After Japan annexed Korea, it established the Governor-General's Office to govern. Righteous patriots gnashed their teeth and were heartbroken, lamenting the oppression of autocracy and mourning the demise of their homeland. Those who advocated resistance fell one after another, and created the Independence Movement of 1919. But due to their weak strength and lack of support, they suffered setbacks. However, their indomitable revolutionary spirit has not ceased to this day. Because the Chinese Revolution has not yet succeeded, it is difficult for the Korean people to be independent. There is no doubt about this. Alas, the vast future, the silent continent. Looking up to the Northeast, grief is overwhelming. When our people see the brutality of the Japanese and the tragic demise of Korea, and read this page of Korean history, can they not shed tears of sympathy and rise up to save the country? Otherwise, they will become successors to the Korean people.</p>
<h3>The Cold Fragrance Pavilion, Where Atrocities Remain</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The Cold Fragrance Pavilion is a famous scenic spot in Tiger Hill, Suzhou. Since coming to Shanghai, I have not visited it for many years. Looking back on past travels, it feels like another world. The pavilion stands halfway up the mountain, with a commanding view. It was built by the local elder generation, Mr. Jin Hewang, Mr. Wang Dingcheng, and others. Three hundred plum trees are planted around it, creating a cold fragrance, hence the name of the pavilion. In early spring, those who love Lin Bu gather there to enjoy the scenery. In the crisp autumn days, they also come together for fun. In the cool winds of summer and the bright snow of winter, many couples also come. Throughout the four seasons, it is never deserted. People also taste tea in the pavilion, looking at the peaks of Lingyan, Zhiqi, Shangfang, and the Lion Ridge. The trains of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway wind through the lush greenery. A bird's-eye view offers a unique charm. I still remember once, when I and other literary friends gathered at the Cold Fragrance Pavilion, Shi Jiqun saw the trains and exclaimed at the spectacle. He couldn't help but blurt out, "From afar, the train looks like a snake." Cheng Zhanlu thought it was a seven-character couplet, like a ditty. So he jokingly added, "From up close, the train looks like a bus. If it's neither far nor near, the head is like a bus and the tail is like a snake." We all clapped and laughed. Unexpectedly, a few days later, news came that Japanese soldiers had shot and killed our Chinese youth. The youth, Hu Zonghan, happened to come here to enjoy the scenery. Two or three Japanese soldiers, indulging in hunting, also visited the pavilion as tourists. Seeing Hu Zonghan wearing a military uniform, they intentionally insulted him. Zonghan responded with harsh words. The Japanese soldiers then shot and killed him. His body lay in the pavilion for several days. The injustice was never redressed. Now, the iron heels of the Japanese barbarians are trampling on our Chinese territory, harming our compatriots beyond counting. If Hu Zonghan's soul is aware, in the dark, rainy weather, he must be howling like a spirit on the hills and in the lofty pavilion.</p>
<h3>Record of Suppressed Tears</h3>
<p>— Lingxiu</p>
<p>The national crisis is severe. It is painful to think about. Yet the ten-mile foreign concessions are still immersed in extravagance and decadence. The hearts of the people are dead. What a sigh! The Ministry of Education recently issued an order requiring cinemas to select patriotic films in order to stimulate public sentiment. This should be followed by film companies. However, there are very few domestic films that can express patriotic sentiments. In recent years, only a few films by the Mingxing Film Company, such as "New Journey to the West," "Black-Clad Heroine," "Struggling Marriage," and "Good Boys," have been seen. It is hoped that domestic filmmakers will act with patriotic enthusiasm and produce more of these films to create the greatest force for artistic propaganda. The revival of the national spirit relies heavily on this. The Japanese are inherently cruel. Domestically, they vigorously promote military-national education. All non-war novels and films are prohibited. Universal's "All Quiet on the Western Front" was once transported to Japan, but could not be screened anywhere, resulting in huge losses for the filmmakers. As for the films they produce themselves, they spare no effort in promoting the samurai spirit. From this, we can see their ambition.</p>
<p>Among American films, there are many that express patriotic thought and national spirit, such as "The Scarlet Empress" and "The Little Minister," to name just a few. What I especially love is "Revenge," starring Lila Lee and Glenn Tryon, because it can inspire patriotic thought in a moving way, rather than merely using crude stimulation to excite people temporarily.</p>
<p>Recently, foreign films screened in Shanghai mostly depict softness and extravagance, promoting decadence and hedonism. Yet our people flock to them, and the influence is significant. I believe that during this national crisis, the best thing for Chinese people to do is to endure hardship and strive for self-improvement. Otherwise, at the very least, we should promote domestic films as a minimum expression of patriotism. As for comedies and dance films, we should absolutely not watch them.</p>
<p>I heard that the Mingxing Company has recently completed "Red Tears." The emotional expression in the film surpasses that of "The Orchid in the Valley" and "The Falling Plum Blossoms." It is so sad and moving that the audience will be unable to hold back their tears.</p>
<h3>Records of Happenings in the Former Capital</h3>
<p>— Temple of Heaven's Imperial Vault of Heaven</p>
<p>The Temple of Heaven covers a wider area than the Forbidden City. Within the temple walls, ancient trees intertwine, and lush grass spreads, making one almost feel as if they are in the countryside. The altars of the Ming Dynasty were originally built in the southern suburbs. However, during the Wanli era, alarms from the northern border arrived daily. Fearing a sudden invasion by strong bandits, an outer city wall was built to enclose the people. Within the walled area, motherwort grew naturally. People specifically gathered this plant to make motherwort extract, which was considered more effective than that produced elsewhere. It was said in the past that the Imperial Ancestral Temple uniquely produced gray cranes that nested in pine and cypress trees, which, along with the grasses of the Temple of Heaven, were considered sacred products. The altar is constructed in three tiers, with white stone railings and steps. The height, width, and circumference all have fixed dimensions. North of the altar is the Imperial Vault of Heaven, a place prepared for conducting ceremonies in case of rain. North of the Imperial Vault of Heaven is the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, both with double-eaved roofs, resplendent in gold and green. European visitors to Beiping particularly marveled at the exquisite beauty of the Imperial Vault of Heaven. This is because the roof is extremely heavy, and the pillars are widely spaced. The even distribution of weight demonstrates unique ingenuity, representing the highest level of Eastern architectural art. Palaces and temples invariably adopt rectangular shapes, but the Imperial Vault of Heaven is circular, truly a masterpiece.</p>
<p>At the hour of Yin (3-5 AM) on the 24th day of the eighth month of the year Ji Chou in the Guangxu reign, thunder and lightning raged, and heavy rain poured down. Suddenly, the plaque of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests caught fire, which then spread. By the hour of Wei (1-3 PM), smoke and flames emerged from the lattice windows of the hall, igniting the beams and pillars. The blaze shone like a rainbow spanning the sky. Thereupon, the Commander of the Infantry issued command arrows and dispatched troops to rush to the rescue. However, because the hall was too tall, the water could not reach the flames. Eventually, the great hall with its eighty-one pillars was completely reduced to ashes. The fragrance permeated everywhere, reaching the main streets, because the hall's materials were all Phoebe nanmu, and the spirit tablets were sandalwood. Even the Han white jade on the steps (white stone produced in the Western Hills, with a quality like precious jade; many palace railings and staircases were made of this material, called Han white jade) was shattered. It was truly a strange disaster. Normally, palace fires are blamed on the custodians. However, it seemed that there was nothing to steal from the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests. It is unknown how the fire started. After the incident, reconstruction was undertaken. The officials of the Ministry of Works thoroughly examined the regulations but found no record of its exact dimensions. Fortunately, an old craftsman was found who had participated in past repairs and vaguely remembered its structure. After much deliberation and searching, the work was finally completed, it is said.</p>
<p>With tears in their voices, the people were furious about the national crisis and wanted to weep but had no tears to shed. Perhaps when "Shadow of Red Tears" is screened, it can be used as a tool to evoke tears. I write this with restrained tears, hoping that these melancholic "Red Tears" can be transformed into patriotic tears of fervor.</p>
<h3>Notes on Tea Tasting and Inkpad Appreciation</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Dou Xia Yizi has an addiction to Lu Yu’s “The Classic of Tea” and is skilled at making inkpad. He uses the alias Ziyi and resides in the Xiyin Study in Ruikang Lane, North Nicheng Bridge, Shanghai. Yesterday, I received an invitation to taste tea and appreciate inkpad. He said a friend was coming from Hangzhou with Tiger Spring water, perfect for a pleasant drink. I went at three o'clock. Upon entering the room, I saw a couplet presented by the senior Zheng Xiaoxu, collected from Han Dynasty steles: "Closing the door to live quietly, a snow-white nature; writing diligently, orchids produce fragrance." His pure character was immediately apparent. He detailed the history of making inkpad, saying that he loved epigraphy in his youth and sought out rubbings from steles. He paid special attention to inkpad and visited various manufacturers, but none satisfied him. He then devoted himself to this craft. After twenty years and spending thousands of gold coins, he finally achieved success. He pointed out the items arranged on the table, classified into eight grades: Divine, Wonderful, High, Refined, Super, Excellent, Superior, and Good. He said that materials like cinnabar, coral, agate, and pearl are all hard in nature, making it difficult to grind them into fine powder. He has separately hired female workers to specialize in this task, coordinating the mixing and preparation. He believes that only he can do this job. Common inkpads use moxa floss, rush pith, willow catkins, and other materials. However, the divine-grade inkpad he makes uses lotus silk, combined with refined gold foil, beautiful split sand, and aged oil of several decades, which was not discovered by his predecessors. The color is as beautiful as a woman with a fair complexion, applying rouge. The inkpad is thin, the color is thick, and after printing, the stone is free of any fine residue. On paper, it is clean and flat. The longer it is stored, the more vibrant the color becomes. The selection of materials is special, hence its miraculous features. Using a stick to pick up the inkpad, it does not stick at all in the jar, and the pure white porcelain of the jar bottom can be seen. Only the most delicate lotus silk is used. The cost of materials and labor is unparalleled, making it a true treasure of the arts. Recently, due to a flood in his hometown, he is offering a 20% discount for three weeks, with all proceeds donated to flood relief. Soon, we moved to the guest hall to sit and taste tea. Besides me, there were also Mr. Zhu Dake and Mr. Gao Zhenying, as well as the former's two children. There were seven small teapots, eight small teacups, and one water bottle on the table. Mr. Xia personally washed the teapots and then placed a handful of tea leaves into one. First, he poured water into a bowl and tested its temperature on the outside of the bowl with his hand. Then, he poured the water into the teapot, frequently shaking it. He opened the lid to check the color and poured the tea into the cups to share. It had a unique flavor, as if we were in Longjing or Tiger Spring. The teas tasted that day included Mingqian Rain, Narcissus, and Plum Blossom, each with a different flavor. Finally, he also served pine nuts, walnuts, dried bamboo shoots, and lotus seeds as snacks, all made by Mr. Xia himself. I took my leave at five o'clock and wrote this as a record.</p>

<h3>The Pestle of Knocking Dreams (9)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>The date of the provincial examination was approaching. "When acacia flowers turn yellow, the candidates are busy." Tao Chi was also one of these busy people. "Son!" When Tao Gongsheng called out this word, his tone contained twelve parts sincerity and expectation...</p>
<p>"Your writing has a manner of looking down from a height, striding forward vigorously. This is called 'original thought and original spirit!' If you don't pass, so be it; but if you pass, you have a good chance of excelling. You and Pei Shi both have great talent. It is a pity that Pei Shi misused his intelligence; this is also his own doing! You, on the other hand, stay on the proper path of the imperial examination, unlike Pei Shi, who went astray. Therefore, I recognize you as a promising lad. 'The day you pass the examination, your parents are not yet old...' Young scholar, strive on!"</p>
<p>Tao Chi, who was already confident, was further encouraged by his father's praise. He was even more determined to pluck the first branch of the cassia tree, not content with being second. He packed the necessary books for the three sessions into his examination basket, paying particular attention to the examination essays that Tao Gongsheng had revised for him.</p>
<p>He accidentally discovered a booklet with tiny, fly-head-sized characters in his desk drawer, which aroused his attention. He thought it was the crystallization of Tao Gongsheng's efforts, worthy of being collected in his examination basket. However, after reading only a few lines, he was ultimately disappointed! He casually wiped away the dust on the examination basket with the booklet and stuffed it into the wastepaper basket next to him, allowing the person collecting wastepaper to hold a cremation ceremony for it in the character-cherishing furnace! This desk was formerly the desk of his deceased friend Pei Shi; this booklet was also a manuscript left behind by his deceased friend Pei Shi. If it were solely written eight-legged essays, Tao Chi would have respected and preserved the relics of his deceased friend. However, upon opening it, it turned out to be what Old Man Pei and general public opinion considered useless and even harmful—descriptions of strange and ingenious crafts.</p>
<p>The few lines that Tao Chi saw and immediately discarded were Pei Shi's creations for playthings. The booklet said: "A plaything, although a toy, contains genuine principles; since play arises from principle, a gentleman should not abandon play altogether. The completed creations include automated plays with music, complete with everything, operating naturally without human effort. There is a lantern district: a small house is made, with several lamps suspended inside. People entering it feel as if they are entering a thoroughfare; the human smoke is dense, the lights are continuous, with a view of several miles. There is a self-propelled fan for dispelling heat: it can shake and create a breeze in the entire room without human effort. The above are all completed; I am drawing pictures and writing explanations for them..."</p>

<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>— Xu Daitu</p>
<p>What a magnificent and grand auditorium, yet filled with solemn sadness and tense atmosphere. The people in the entire hall were standing silently at attention, bowing their heads in silent respect to the portrait of the Father of the Nation. Everyone held their breath, and the entire universe seemed desolate and still. Although they were silently mourning, in their minds and ears, they seemed to hear the rumbling of gunfire from the northeast.</p>
<p>Although they were silent, their blood was not cold but boiling. Everyone vowed to save the endangered motherland, and everyone was willing to fight the enemy with their lives. How could they allow the sacred and beloved Chinese people to be slaughtered?</p>
<p>How can we allow them to sleep soundly beside our bed? What are the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations if not masks of the strong countries and painted cakes for the weak? The weak have never benefited from them, and the strong have never slightly restrained their ambitions. The survival of the fittest in the theory of evolution is not wrong. How can relying on others bring any benefit? If you want to survive in this world, you must strive to resist foreign aggression and seek a way to live. As long as we are united, how difficult is it to defeat the enemy completely? As long as we persevere to the end, how difficult is it to take the enemy's life? A true man dying on the battlefield, his body wrapped in horsehide, has fulfilled his national duty and his ambitions as a man. Moreover, at this time, it is a critical moment for our great Chinese nation. Moreover, we should take this opportunity to wipe out the past national humiliation of the Republic of China. Dr. Sun Yat-sen on the wall also dedicated his life for the country and the nation. We should live up to the Father of the Nation's earnest exhortations and expectations. We should strive to fight for the survival of our nation. Although the time of silence does not need to be long, that firm determination to strive and fight hard has been even more deeply etched in everyone's heart.</p>
<h3>Class Meeting</h3>
<p>— Benwu Shan</p>
<p>In the morning, the bell for the first class broke the calm air. Students, some carrying large stacks of books, came out of the dormitory, others came out of the reading room, talking as they slowly walked into the classroom. "Oh, cold-blooded animals, you can do your arithmetic problems so calmly...Heh, you really seem to be obsessed with arithmetic!"</p>
<p>"Don't calculate so obliviously. Now is not the time to calculate...and, think about it, what have you calculated anyway? This major incident of Japan forcibly occupying our South Manchuria, did you calculate that?" Mu Heyu came out of the reading room, walked into the classroom, and seeing his classmates sitting together quietly, seemingly very interested in calculating, couldn't help but jokingly say to them. "Cold-blooded animals, you're well-informed...We spent our entire evening class time last night discussing how to express our attitude toward Japan's forcible occupation of South Manchuria. Today, after all the students arrive, do you know what we're going to do?" Yu said triumphantly and mockingly, while stuffing his arithmetic textbook, exercise book, and other things into the drawer. "We're going to hold a class meeting to discuss the matter of Japan's invasion of our territory," class leader Li, who was also the chairman of the meeting, said seriously to Mu Heyu.</p>
<p>After a while, all the students in the class arrived. Chairman Li walked onto the podium with an "ah" sound, cleared his throat, and announced the official start of the meeting. Then, he asked us what method we should use to express our attitude towards Japan.</p>
<p>Before some students could think of an answer to the chairman's question, the arithmetic teacher for the first class began to appear hesitant at the classroom door.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Wang, we are very sorry. Please lend us a few minutes to hold a class meeting. After we finish the meeting, we'll resume class," Chairman Li said as he welcomed the arithmetic teacher, who was hesitating outside the classroom, inside, in a seemingly respectful and solemn manner.</p>
<p>"Oh, hold a class meeting...Oh, it's not right to ask me to 'lend you a few minutes.' That's your time, not my time. And it's even more wrong to say 'we are very sorry,' because..." The arithmetic teacher's words could be said to be very complaining, but because his attitude when speaking was not serious but humorous, and the expression on his face was not one of unhappiness but of sympathetic sighs, the students did not mind at all and instead burst into laughter, interrupting the arithmetic teacher's words.</p>
<p>"Our school is one of the best in Shanghai and holds a leading position among schools. Therefore, I think the way we express our attitude towards Japan should be more enthusiastic, and we should especially sacrifice more of our class time. So, I propose that we all sacrifice class time and go out into the streets outside the school to give speeches, to let the general public hear about the plight of our country and Japan's vicious ambitions." Mu first proposed. When he finished speaking and sat down, he glanced at the arithmetic teacher, who was also paying attention to her at that time.</p>
<p>Many students expressed their opposition, some saying, "Giving speeches in the streets will disrupt social order." Some said, "Women's voices are relatively soft, so they are not suitable for giving speeches in public places." Some said, "The principal, the director of academic affairs, and the director of student affairs will definitely not agree to us going out to give speeches. They shout enthusiastic slogans to us, but this is just for us to hear, not for us to put into practice." Some said, "..." Many, many dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>In this way, one item was proposed on one side, and one item was refuted on the other. Finally, Mr. Wang said, "If you continue to debate like this, this meeting will never end. Why don't you just be casual...Oh, not casual...Why don't you just write some slogans and paste them everywhere." The students listened to Mr. Wang's words, and then they suddenly clamored into one piece. Some said, "I wanted to say that, but Mr. Wang took the words right out of my mouth." Some said, "Just pasting some slogans seems too simple." Some said, "..." But these are not important, because this proposal was finally agreed upon by most of the students and established.</p>
<p>When Mr. Wang heard that we had adopted his proposal, he said triumphantly, "What a pity, I had thought of this proposal a long time ago. Otherwise, if I had said it earlier, wouldn't we be able to be in class at this time? But, although, now you should dismiss the meeting. The things you want to do, wait until after class...Oh, take out your books, I want to teach." Mr. Wang slowly searched for the page he had taught in the previous class, intending to continue teaching.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, you are too calculating with us. Don't you know that we are very willing to sacrifice our time, if it is necessary for us to sacrifice?"</p>
<p>"Oh, does everyone agree to grind ink, cut paper, and write slogans now?"</p>
<p>"Arithmetic teacher, anyway, it's our time, let us finish this matter before we teach."</p>
<p>"Oh, half an hour is not enough. Mr. Wang, go to the teacher's office to rest. In this kind of emergency, we really have no heart to attend class."</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, help us think of some slogans, okay? Because you might be able to think of some kind of slogan that people won't easily forget when they see it."</p>
<p>"Ah, really, arithmetic teacher, you can really show your great skill and calculate!"</p>
<p>Many students who liked to make trouble, each said a sentence, with serious faces, pretending to be respectful, stood up and said to Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>"Alright, do whatever you like. You are originally sacrificing your time to do your patriotic actions." After Mr. Wang finished speaking, he coldly walked out of the classroom. At that time, other classes were in session, and everything was silent except for the voices of the teachers. "Tap...tap..." Very clearly, the sparse sound of Mr. Wang's leather shoes echoed slowly, as if sighing.</p>
<h3>Before and After the Occupation of Shenyang</h3>
<p>— Zhu Fujun</p>
<p>The daylight-like lights suddenly disappeared, and a faint green glow instantly appeared before our eyes.</p>
<p>The sound of the violin slowly echoed on the stage, like a dream. The temptation of color, the writhing of flesh, thunderous applause from the audience below the stage, dancers intoxicated, dancing stars graceful, the temptation of color, the writhing of flesh, thunderous applause from the audience below the stage, "Ah!" Suddenly, a stray bullet—a stray bullet quietly flew in through the glass window, and the struck dancer suddenly let out such a miserable cry.</p>
<p>In the midst of the miserable cry, he suddenly fell down. Everyone's faces turned pale. The lights suddenly brightened. Chaotic figures filled the dance hall. The lights suddenly brightened, followed by the mournful cries of women.</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>The refugee train was just starting to move its cars, fully loaded with people, people.</p>
<p>Cries, cries.</p>
<p>The train moved forward quickly. The sounds of gunfire, artillery, collapsing houses, and people gradually faded into the distance, further and further away. What remained was only the lonely sound of weeping on the train.</p>
<p>The train moved forward quickly. The sounds of gunfire, artillery, collapsing houses, and people gradually faded into the distance, further and further away. The strong young men jumped off the train, ready to sacrifice themselves.</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>Smoke filled the sky above Shenyang's city walls. The wind in Shenyang carried the furious cries and curses. Shenyang's arsenal was exploding. The tragic songs of the men resounded through the clouds.</p>
<p>"Forward, forward, forward! You barbarian dwarfs! You have sharp guns and cannons, you have boiling red blood, you have extraordinary arrogance, but here we have prepared courage and determination!"</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>Beside the strong young man who jumped off the train, a fierce Japanese soldier approached from afar. He walked toward him with a lewd smile. He rushed forward, seized the soldier's sword, and killed him.</p>
<p>He obtained this moment of joyful release of anger, but suddenly—</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bullet pierced his back. He turned around and saw three or four enemies behind him. He wanted to chase after them—but he fell to the ground. A faint sunlight shone over the earth, leaving an immortal mark on a corner outside Shenyang city.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<p>Twenty Years of Manchukuo and Mongolia Under Japanese Influence</p>
<p>Edited by: Chen Jing</p>
<p>Now, we are facing a national crisis, a critical moment for the survival of the nation. In recent days, the urgent news in the newspapers, the sorrowful and tragic cries, have shaken the Central Plains and the entire world. This time, Japan's invasion of the Northeast, the plundering of our land and property rights, the slaughter of our compatriots, the inhumanity of its iron heel, and its advance to probe key locations such as Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai, boasting and demonstrating, provoking challenges, intending to annex, this alarming and frightening scene, puts our country in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>However, people must first decay before others insult them. If we put our hearts into investigating the reasons for today's crisis, we cannot help but hate the fact that for twenty years, the Chinese people have paid too little attention to Manchuria and Mongolia. This negligence and misjudgment has gradually evolved into today's tragedy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the book "Twenty Years of Manchukuo and Mongolia Under Japanese Influence" is truly a clear and resounding bell in the middle of a deep sleep, simply and vividly revealing the ferocious and encroaching face and frightening situation of the Japanese empire before our eyes, giving the people a stark awakening, urging them to rise up quickly and take action. Manchuria and Mongolia are the focus of contention among the great powers in the "Far East Problem," and Japan regards the development of its survival relationship as even more critical. It represents everything with the "Manchuria-Mongolia Problem," clearly concentrating its aggression and obtaining special benefits from special relationships.</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia is the implementation of its "continental policy" over the past twenty years, that is, in its colonial method of plundering raw materials and selling goods, it has promoted the final stage of its capitalism.</p>
<p>The motivation for compiling "Twenty Years of Manchukuo and Mongolia Under Japanese Influence" seems to be the association and impression forced out of the taste of "miso soup" poured over white rice, a mysterious food that the author, Mr. Chen Jing, encountered every day while living abroad. Let us look at a passage from his "Memories After Writing This Book":</p>
<p>"In the Dalian area of Liaodong Peninsula, our Chinese Eastern Three Provinces, Japanese factories produce more than 1 million catties of this thing. Japanese factories in Fengtian produce more than 1 million catties. Japanese factories in Gongzhuling along the South Manchurian Railway also produce more than 40,000 catties. Last year, more than 3 million catties were transported from Manchuria to Japan for consumption, worth more than tens of thousands of yuan. These 'miso' are made from a portion of the more than 4,000 shi of soybeans from Manchuria and Mongolia. These 4,000 shi of soybeans are cultivated from more than 40,000 mu of farmland in Manchuria and Mongolia by the countless sweat and blood of the people. Last year, more than 25 million catties of soybeans were transported from Manchuria to Japan. Some of these soybeans were also turned into 'miso.' Perhaps an extremely small portion of these 'miso' was eaten by me."</p>
<p>From tasting the flavor of "miso" to thinking about the situation of his homeland, he felt even more painfully that drops of fresh blood were being squeezed away by others. This is what the author finds most distressing, and this may already be a microcosm of the Manchuria-Mongolia policy in reality. The book analyzes Japan's deeply rooted colonial policy in Manchuria and Mongolia over the past twenty years, such as how many Japanese colonists there are in Manchuria and Mongolia, what methods they use to solve their colonial life, and what is Japan's immigration policy toward Korea, how many Koreans are there, what is their degree and nature, where do they immigrate to, what policy does Japan adopt toward them, how does it force them, how does it use them, secondly, how does Japan politically oppress Manchuria and Mongolia, how does it plunder them economically, how does it invest, how does it plunder raw materials and labor, how does it sell its surplus goods, how does it extract profits and currency, how does it engage in monopoly in the transportation industry, how does it engage in aggression in the cultural industry, and finally, to what extent will it develop its colonial policy, all of which are analyzed in this book. The book uses population as the object of study when looking at the number and nature of Japanese colonists in Manchuria and Mongolia, as well as their immigration methods and places of immigration. This is the outline of Japan's colonial policy, which is the general theory of this book. As for Manchuria and Mongolia, the various forms of Japanese oppression and aggression in the political, economic, transportation, and cultural fields are the functioning of Japan's colonial policy. This is moving from the outline to the strength, which is the special theory of this book.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The general theory describes the overview of Japanese colonization of Manchuria and Mongolia and is divided into two chapters.</p>
<p>The first chapter explains the relationship between Japan's rapid population growth and its colonization of Manchuria and Mongolia. Since the Meiji Restoration, from 1870 (Meiji 3) to 1920, in 57 years, Japan's population rapidly increased from more than 33 million to more than 55.9 million, which is no longer comparable to the slow population growth rate before the industrial development from 600 years ago to 1868. Due to the rapid population growth and material panic, it then colonized our country's Eastern Three Provinces and Inner Mongolia to realize its policy of plundering land and capital. Its colonization methods are: first, directly colonizing Manchuria and Mongolia, which it has been advocating for twenty years with the slogan of 4 million Manchurian and Mongolian colonists. Looking at the tables of Japanese households and population in Manchuria and Mongolia in each year in the book, we know that the Japanese colonial population in Manchuria and Mongolia is increasing year by year, with leased territories and railway-affiliated areas as the concentration points, gradually infiltrating into the depths of Manchuria and Mongolia; second, indirectly colonizing Manchuria and Mongolia. Japan initially immigrated to Korea, and then forced Korean people to immigrate to Manchuria and Mongolia. The total number of indirect immigration from Koreans to Manchuria and Mongolia is more than five times the total number of Japanese in Manchuria and Mongolia. This is really a pungent policy of Japan, clearly expressing the ambition of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>The second chapter describes the relationship between Japan's entire colonial policy and its Manchuria-Mongolia colonial policy. Originally, Japan's colonial policy was realized in different ways based on three arguments: (1) the Greater Asia policy, which is to invade all of Asia from Manchuria and Mongolia, also known as the Northward Expansion Theory; (2) the Southward Expansion Theory, which is to colonize the South Sea Islands, Australia, and the vast Pacific coast of the Americas to build a new Japan; (3) the Secret Strategy of Universal Unification, which is to colonize everywhere in the world. However, the Southward Expansion Theory and the Secret Strategy of Universal Unification clash with the colonial strategies of European and American imperialism. As a result, it has suffered severe exclusion from the United States and British self-governing colonies, and there is no possibility of development. Therefore, Japan had to change its colonial argument and concentrate on attacking the Eastern Three Provinces and Inner Mongolia, that is, to realize the so-called Northward Expansion Theory.</p>
<p>Japan's form of colonizing Manchuria and Mongolia is the result of its competition with various imperialist countries for colonies and its aggression against weak foreign nations and oppression of weak domestic people. It treats Manchuria and Mongolia in the same way as it treats colonization and Korea. Its Ministry of Internal Affairs handles the reception, protection, supervision, and promotion of overseas immigration associations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs handles subsidies for colonial travel expenses and publishes reports on colonial surveys. Its recent outline for revitalizing colonization, comprehensively speaking, includes: (1) cultivating and popularizing colonial thought; (2) emphasizing publications and publicity in Manchuria and Mongolia and the activities of organizing associations; (3) giving full play to the mutual production relationship and characteristics of various Japanese colonies; (4) using colonial policies to deal with the recent disputes among rural tenant farmers in Japan. The special theory explains the function of Japan's colonial policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia, which is entirely concentrated on unequal political forces and relies on the military to be the pioneers and supporters of such treaty expansion, or is constructed by colluding with warlords and politicians with money. China's most significant losses in these abnormal treaties: (1) Regarding land lease rights, administrative rights, and freedom of residence, etc.; (2) Regarding railway operations and loan rights, etc.; (3) Regarding mining and forest exploitation rights and company joint ventures, etc.; (4) Regarding tariff exemption rights or reduced special rights, etc. In short, the rights that Japan has obtained in Manchuria and Mongolia are all obtained through unequal treaties.</p>
<p>This chapter describes in detail (1) Japan's political efforts and its organization in Manchuria and Mongolia; (2) Japan's implementation of police power and special forms in Manchuria and Mongolia; (3) Japan's exploitation of taxes and miscellaneous levies in Manchuria and Mongolia; (4) The issues of the Japanese troops and their power deployed in Manchuria and Mongolia are all thoroughly explored and accompanied by various tables.</p>
<p>The first part recounts the function of Japan's economic aggression, which is due to the effect of unbalanced imports, and is divided into five chapters: The first chapter, on the plundering of raw materials, such as (1) the minerals of Manchuria and Mongolia; (2) the forests of Manchuria and Mongolia; (3) the animal husbandry of Manchuria and Mongolia; (4) the aquatic products of Manchuria and Mongolia; (5) the agricultural products of Manchuria and Mongolia. The second chapter, on investment in commerce and industry, such as (1) financial domination; (2) monetary monopoly; (3) trade monopoly; (4) commerce; (5) industry, etc. The third chapter, transportation, such as (1) railways; (2) shipping; (3) communications, etc. The fourth chapter, culture, such as (1) education; (2) religion; (3) the publishing industry, etc., are all based on statistics. After this is the epilogue.</p>
<p>I have given a brief introduction to this book as outlined above. I feel infinite thoughts in my heart. Although we hate Japan's atrocities in the Northeast and are working together to overcome the national crisis, we cannot help but be amazed by their organized and prepared work and spirit on weekdays. The materials in this book are very rich, and some of the illustrations and tables are not easy to find. I hope readers will pay special attention to them and keep the impressions after reading deeply in their minds as firm fuel for our spirit and intellect.</p>

<h3>Not Dead</h3>
<p>— Huang Huanruo</p>
<p>{Comfort gained from publicity work}</p>
<p>The incident of the violent Japanese trampling on the Eastern Provinces is expanding day by day. Our territory is gradually being蚕食 by them, and large numbers of our compatriots are being slaughtered by them. This barbaric and cruel beastly behavior does not seem to be restrained by justice, nor can its conscience be revealed by non-resistance.</p>
<p>I, who have always advocated that studying hard is saving the country, can no longer calm my surging passion and surging emotions at this critical moment. It is true that under the cover of such numb and non-resistant people, it is no longer the time for us to study. Because the responsibility of saving the country can only be shouldered by us pure-hearted youths and the people. I have suddenly realized that I dare not put down my books, and I cannot move my body outside. Standing under the banner of reading without forgetting to save the country, I finally joined the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. As a member of the warrior, anger burns in my heart, and indignation inspires my chest. I can't help but shout out such awakening words under the shaking small flag, "Saving the country cannot passively wait for the enemy's conscience to be discovered, because beasts have no conscience. Saving the country cannot rely on the just aid of the great powers, because the world has obliterated justice. To save the endangered China from destruction, we can only rely on our own strength, our own courage. This is a good opportunity for us to serve the country."</p>
<p>Thousands of resolute and courageous young people lined up like long snakes on the school road, waiting spiritedly for the time of departure to come. Hardworking students have left the library, and delicate female students have also stepped out of the palace gate. All comfort and enjoyment will no longer haunt everyone's minds. The ferocious beastly face and brutal cruelty of the Japanese invaders seem to be unfolding before our eyes.</p>
<p>Our team was sent to the Wusong countryside to carry out propaganda. So we took the train to our destination, Wusong. Qiu held the small flag in front and led the way, because he was familiar with the geography of Wusong.</p>
<p>Walking out of Songzhen, a group of fifteen people walked excitedly along the rugged narrow path towards the village hidden in the greenery.</p>
<p>Beside a small lake, there was a green grassy beach, which was outside a village. We stopped here to discuss the outline of the propaganda, arranged the order of the speeches, and the fifteen of us simultaneously swore an oath on the responsibility of saving the country. Our oath was:</p>
<p>"From today onwards, we are determined to engage in the work of saving the country. We are not afraid of difficulties, we are not afraid of death. We are willing to sacrifice everything to go to the national crisis. We will eliminate selfish desires and eliminate the habit of relying on others. We should unite and work together to seek the country. If there is any behavior that violates the oath, it should be abandoned by the people, sworn by all members of the XX Propaganda Team of XX University, September 25, 20th year."</p>
<p>A few minutes later, we had dispersed throughout the village and began our propaganda work.</p>
<p>The impression of the Japanese people's brutality has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the entire nation since the May Fourth Movement. When we reported the motives for our speech, the farmers said in unison, "What, are the Easterners (commonly known as the Japanese as Easterners) bullying us Chinese again? Dwarf slaves, hateful dwarf slaves." Groups of farmers put down their work and listened quietly to our speeches.</p>
<p>Fang's speech was extremely impassioned, extremely sincere, and extremely indignant. The farmers listened to her moving speech and constantly whispered, "This female teacher is right. We should not buy Dongyang goods (Japanese goods). We should join the army. Damn it, if we don't kill the Dongyang people, we can no longer eat in peace."</p>
<p>"Female teacher, if the Japanese are so unreasonable and so fierce, why don't we go to war with them?" A farmer eagerly asked Fang. Many faces pressed close to her, as if waiting to solve this doubt. "We don't fully understand the government's intentions for this reason, but the biggest reason is probably that the armaments are too bad to fight against Japan. Now we are urging the government to prepare for war. If the Japanese soldiers refuse to withdraw, then it is expected that a war will eventually break out." "Damn it, waiting for the war, let's all rise up and fight the dwarfs to see who is stronger."</p>
<p>"Teacher, can we also join the army to fight the Dongyang people?" The voices were noisy, and the flames of ardent patriotism were blazing.</p>
<p>"Yes, the National Salvation Volunteer Army will be organized soon, which will welcome you to participate. If you are willing to sacrifice your lives to save the country, then you can sign up, join the military training, and when necessary, you will have to go to the front line and fight a life-and-death battle with the enemies."</p>
<p>When we first entered the village, what we saw was only an unusual calm. At a time when the national crisis was dire, we felt pity and deathly silence when we looked at the passionate and energetic people. It seemed that we vaguely felt the sorrow that people's hearts were dead and the country's affairs were hopeless. However, after our speech, the farmers' passionate blood, excited courage, and spiritual expression suddenly excited us. Although the superiors are numb and indifferent, the hearts of the people are still active, and the country's destiny should not be cut off. Two hours later, we left the lovely and promising farmers amidst a tragic farewell.</p>
<p>In addition, we found another village. Naturally, everything was generally the same as in the previous village. I couldn't help but sigh and say, "Only these simple farmers can save the country. Unfortunately, they have not been given sufficient education and cultivation, which has left them in intellectual hunger." The teammates all sympathized with my words, and popularizing mass education made us even more believe that it was one of the lasting methods of saving the country. On the way back, darkness enveloped the vast twilight. In the tension of the autumn wind, we finally suffered a heavy rain. Wet clothes pressed against our skin, which was very uncomfortable. But when I thought of the compatriots in the Eastern Provinces who had been swept by guns and artillery fire, I felt relieved.</p>
<p>"The days to come will be filled with artillery fire and bombs. What does this mere wind and rain count for?" Yan's cheongsam was soaked by the rain and clung tightly to her body. She stumbled through the mud and said heroically.</p>
<h3>Propaganda and the Ah Q Era</h3>
<p>— Jun Liang</p>
<p>When the news that the violent Japanese had advanced into the Eastern Three Provinces and forcibly occupied our territory reached our school from the newspapers, it was early morning and the sunlight was vaguely shining on the flagpole of the gymnasium in the northeast corner of the school. The students restrained their usual smiles, and their minds were filled with sad and resentful thoughts. The students' blood boiled.</p>
<p>The next morning, the playground was full of students. In the past, perhaps a游艺会 could have enticed so many people. The chairman announced, "If there are any students who do not attend today, we would rather not hold the meeting." Then there was a burst of applause. Finally, the meeting began.</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun, our speakers who wept and spoke</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>and the students who listened attentively, their faces were red and their ears were burning hot.</p>
<p>After a few days of discussion and meetings, the result was to go out for publicity. The old articles from before, although old, might have some effect on the numb and indifferent Chinese people. We initially held this hope.</p>
<p>Our team was sent to a small town in the northeast of Shanghai. It was not far from the cultural center of Shanghai. When we arrived at our destination, we carried out propaganda, distributed leaflets, and gave speeches. The people were at the market near the small bridge late in the evening. We stood still. The village children first aroused curiosity. They wanted leaflets. The number of people gathered was not small. We started speaking. They were all furtive, as if afraid of us, with rare expressions of surprise on their faces.</p>
<p>"...The Japanese are now killing our compatriots," the speaker shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Japanese..." An old man frowned and whispered something in the ear of a relatively young middle-aged man.</p>
<p>"Foreign executioners," the middle-aged man replied impatiently.</p>
<p>"Easterners! Dwarf slaves! We don't want to buy Dongyang goods!" The speaker raised his voice very high.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dongyang people," the old man and the middle-aged man both indicated that they understood.</p>
<p>"You can ask whatever you don't understand." When the speaker shot his gaze at the old man's face, he hurriedly turned around and left. The middle-aged man and many children and women were also silent. It was drizzling, and they gradually dispersed, and we also left.</p>
<p>When we arrived at a bustling market, we gave speeches in a more crowded place. The speaker was very sincere, and the listeners also looked elsewhere, nodding to indicate that they understood. Suddenly, a long-faced man said with a contemptuous expression, "The Dongyang people only know how to beat the Chinese, because our mouths can't move. To be honest, the Dongyang people have come here, and we two will fight one, tear them apart and eat them. What's the use of you talking?" After he said this, he stared at the sky, as if he really saw two people tearing one person apart and eating them. "What you said is true, but many people still don't know that the Dongyang people are killing us at the door."</p>
<p>"I understand very well... In fact, there are all kinds of foreign executioners in Shanghai, and they won't let the Dongyang people in. We can rest assured." He glanced around, thinking that this was his highest opinion.</p>
<p>Finally, we arrived at the town's public opinion representative place, the teahouse. It was almost full of tea drinkers. We started speaking at the table of an old man with a monk's head. The monk's head had a face full of horizontal flesh, and two rows of beards hung down from the corners of his mouth. While we were speaking, the monk's head kept lifting his thick lips, wanting to speak. Finally, we finished speaking, and he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"We country people wear our own old cloth and eat yellow rice. Not to mention Dongyang goods, we don't even use Western goods." As he spoke, he looked at our clothes, as if saying, "Look at yourselves." We were speechless.</p>
<p>"You scold the Dongyang people, but we country people either have braids or shave our heads. Haha, combing Dongyang's head and scolding the Dongyang people." The monk's head touched his beard and smiled, revealing his waxy yellow teeth. Then everyone in the teahouse laughed.</p>
<p>It was raining again. Raindrops poured in from the northeast corner of the teahouse. The tea drinkers moved around one after another. We took advantage of the chaos, put on our raincoats, and left the teahouse.</p>
<p>In the gloomy twilight of the cold wind and rain, we walked out of this small town, and still seemed to hear harsh laughter.</p>
<p>The Ah Q era is not dead.</p>
