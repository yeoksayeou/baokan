<h3 id="c32">銀之問題 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>今日世界上。對於銀之問題。已認爲重要問題之一。一如各國之失業問題與軍縮問題等均爲有識者所盡力研究也。</p>
<p>例如美國畢特門之救銀報告内容。仍如所傳。一·對英開談判。以期終止將印度現銀傾銷於世界市塲之政策。二·開國際會議。以謀用銀爲副幣之諒解。三·以國際銀借欵。借於中國。此三事之果否能行。行之而果否有益於銀之價格。現亦本能預料也。</p>
<p>又如中國銀行張公權之論銀價問題其主張一爲產銀各國須有犧牲精神。實行限止出產二爲產銀國家須停止出售。三爲美國須允許在一定之銀與金比例之下。收回無限制的部分借欵。四爲各國援助中國採用金本位同時已經採用金本位之國家。須以銀本位爲副幣。五爲少數國家須訂約不以各該國之現銀出售或出借凡此五端或與畢特門之救銀報告相同或採諸其他各國人之意見。而其最要之一點。必須有人肯自犧牲此實爲現世界至難之一事也。</p>

<p>國民社十一日柏林電　德外長寇蒂斯今日在國會演說、作外交報告、以德國無時不抱融洽政策、恪遵現行條約爲演說主旨、首述出席日内瓦國際聯盟各項會議經過情形、嗣論各重要問題、謂德國對於歐洲聯邦計劃、常抱積極態度、但力主士俄有加入之必要、今日欲圖解决全歐洲之困難、第一步當求歐洲各國之團結一致、而法德親善實爲其樞紐、希望前此兩國睦誼進展上之障碍、不久即可消除、我人之要求、完全顧及他人利益、在和平與友誼之談判中易於解决、德人固大多數準備接受合作新方法與歐洲聯邦新方式、但亦堅决反對以崩壞德國爲重造歐洲之基礎、至於軍縮問題、要求他國軍縮作同等減縮、乃德人固有之權利、我人所要求之安全程度、無以異於他政府、倘他國政府主張自有保障國土準備防禦方案之權利、我人亦當要求同樣之權利、未來之軍縮大會、爲國際聯盟生死存亡之試騐期、倘告失敗、則國聯亦將喪失其存在之權利、目下國聯成績之可以抨擊者固多、但我人當無庸退出、若異日遇有與吾國重大關係之問題、國聯果不能解决時、則我人亦當改步易行、最後論及賠欵問題、謂德國未曾保障完全確實履行楊格計劃、渠信賠欵問題、遲早終有切實解决之一日、德人呻吟憔悴於賠欵重負之下、勢將無以自全、但目下已有理由可信世人漸曉此種眞相、若操之過急、轉致有害無益、故我人不得不權衡時宜、總之審察時機、設法減輕我人之負担、乃外交政策中急要这圖云云、寇氏演說時、政府黨議員一再歐呼鼓掌、共產黨議員則屢次呌嚣、希圖阻撓發言、至國社黨及國權黨議員、因認修改議塲規則違反憲法、故於施行新規則時、全體不再出席以示抗議、</p>

<p>國民社十一日巴黎電　此間對於德外長在國會中演說、極爲注意·左派各報大都表示同情、稱其措辭殊爲明白清晣、自由報謂其演說中、有三大重要表示、（一）德國願留居國際聯盟仍與之合作、（二）德國雖不保證楊格計劃之永久實行、但亦不欲輕廢該計劃、（三）承認德法外交、爲德國外交政策中柱石、巴黎廻聲報則稱、法外部亦作同樣明白之宣言、小巴黎人報則謂寇氏演說、含有宣言性質、雖無甚新表赤、但在德人平素之辯辭上、加以一種力量、此種力量、恐未必能增進德法邦交、有如寇氏之所期望、料此項演說、殆因顧念内政而發云、</p>

<p>野黨决定第二步策戰</p>
<p>貴院空氣於政府不利</p>
<p>電通社十二日東京電　衆院預算總會、承連日大紛擾之後、於十二日上午十時開塲、政民兩派委員及傍聽議員以問題早已解决、入場時非常平穩、至十一時三十五分武内委員長亦入場就席、但幣原男及各大臣不見一人、各員均守沉默、十二時二分委員長宣告開會、同時休憩、延至午後一時再開、</p>
<p>日聯社電　十二日午後一時三十分、再開預算總會、武内委員長求預算審議期間延長之諒解、幣原面色稍呈蒼白、朗讀預擬之草稿曰「日胶對於中島君關於倫敦條約御批准之質問、余之答辯中有失言、茲取消其全部」、次島田俊雄謂、「關於幣原代首相之失言、在本會議中果不再追究、但今日須聲明者、現在及將來若有違背憲政根本之言動、當絲毫不能假借矣」、又曰、「傳聞濱口首相近來大有起色、業已恢復健康、徵諸濱口氏致各方面之應酬信札中、明言有親自到院之可能、可以想見矣、病已愈而仍令代理首相代行國務、實屬有虧臣節」、波瀾汹湧之失言問題、至此遂告一段落、</p>
<p>電通社十二日東京電　因幣原代首相於本日取消失言、故議會混亂、形式上已歸於鎭靜、但政友會將移入第二段之策戰、今後决以合法的戰術、追求政府之責任、甚至或以幣原男於法理的政治的不獨毫無代理總理之資格、且如此次之重大失言、使憲政之運用進步、發生多大之障碍、是爲立憲政治之最無能力者爲理由、準備於預算案提出本會議以前、提出幣原總理代理彈劾、或上奏案、此外政友會方面、並以非因天災地變、使預算審議其問延長、决以此追求政府之責任、同時暴露安達内相之偵探政治、猛烈攻擊政府、寗爲玉碎、不爲瓦全、</p>
<p>電通社十二日東京電　綜觀貴院各派對幣原代首相取消失言之意見、大抵如下、交友俱樂部及其他反政府系謂幣原男旣知爲失言而取消之、則其責任非常重大、貴院未可輕輕看過、政府派謂旣已取消、則問題消滅、貴院若再追窮、徒使政爭繁雜化而已、中立派則謂追窮幣原男之責任、貴院雖不能贊成、但使議事進行發生極大障碍、政府之責任實重且大、且屈服於暴力之前、足見施政方針、毫無定見云、故上院大多數之空氣、將因失言問題、益信於政府不利、如濱口總理不能出席、重要法案難免不受惡影響云、</p>

<p>路透社十一日倫敦電　保守黨艾文斯提出彈劾政府濫增支出之動議後、財政大臣史諾登在下院發言、謂國家地位嚴重已甚、不得不採行峻厲而招人憎惡之方法、以維持預算案之平衡、而便利實業之恢復、興盛時代易於敷衍之支出、在工業大衰落、且亦無從加稅之時代中、則爲不可能事、本屆財政年底預算短缺必多、已無庸諱言、過去一年内、英國失業大增、此種出人意外之担負、無論世界各國之預算案、咸不能堪、支出旣增、收入則减、出產力低落什二、然英國信用在今日較五年來任何時期爲高、各大實業國中受實業凋敝之影響者、以英國爲較少、但英國地位中有容易受損之一點、即英國爲世界最大財政集中點、他國莫不注視英國是也、是以英國必須維持其財政名譽、世界各國之地位、未有視英國更穩健者、英國今所需者、在努力載勝目前難關耳、英國並非需甚大之努力、但需各方暫時犧牲而已、閣員在普遍的犧牲中、將有實在之供獻云、自由黨麥克倫主張指派少數獨立委員會條陳减少國家支出之便於實行合乎法律的辦法、保守黨揚格稱、財政大臣所發之言、乃大戰以後最嚴重之宣佈、但猶未足爲彈劾案之答覆云、保守黨賀恩稱、目前困難、由於工價高與捐稅高、英國現所費去之鉅欵、雖世界最富國亦莫能堪、現必須有大撙節、必須有大减扣、或减工價、或减捐稅、政府不可不决定之云、（工黨呼曰减戰債）彈劾案因政府多七十五票、遂不成立、自由黨所提出指派小股委員會條陳减少支出方法之動議、後爲多數議員所通過、</p>
<p>路透社十一日倫敦電　今夜財政大臣發言後、聞者對於孰應犧牲一層、頗多懸測、衆意全體民政官員槪須减薪、工黨黨員頗慮僱主將以史諾登言論爲口實、同時有數種工業之職工、已聲明裁减工資之無理由、據一般人意見、史諾登特向同黨警告大規模社會事業計畫之不可能、無論如何、今晚言論勢必引起工黨内部之嚴重反響、此乃無可疑者、再今晚爲保守黨結束辯論者係賀恩氏、而非爲邱吉爾氏、可見邱吉爾因印度問題與包爾温意見不合、現已將未來保守黨内閣之財政一席讓與賀恩矣、</p>
<p>路透社十二日倫敦電　今日消息、英國閣員已議定願减薪什一、蓋從財政大臣史諾登昨夜所發在普遍的犧牲中、閣員將有所貢獻之請也、</p>

<p>近年世界各國。離婚案件。層出不窮。此風盛行於美。而蔓延及於歐洲大陸。男女之間。忽合忽離。視屬尋常。並無制限。現聞羅馬尼亞。巳釐定離婚法律。以事補救。實行之後。社會間競尙離婚之風。當可稍戢矣。</p>
<p>最新之婚律。爲司法部長裘寗博士所手訂。對於男女間之遺棄及不遵信約。均須加以嚴厲之處罰。例如丈夫遺其妻於家。久居在外。或妻室任意離其男子。不與共守。皆當按律科以罰金。或代以拘役。其刑期約自三個月至一年。又法律上關於外遇問題。亦規定罰欵甚重。倘男女巳立約婚嫁。苟一方面忽因故請求解除。則禮品信物之歸還。應經過法律手續。不得雙方私相授受。其保障訂有婚約之男女。更稱周密。定親之指環。在法律上與婚戒並重。且女子或遭退婚。仍須於其人名上聯以前之未婚夫名字。直至得二次求愛之情人。更定婚約。始可脫離。又新律上附帶規定。對於私生子亦多利益。蓋私生子註册。仍用其生父之姓氏。遺棄之後。苟一旦覓得其父。則一切敎養等費。均可按法追求。强制執行也。</p>

<p>輓近畫苑。多巾幗者流。如吳杏芬·張紅薇·樊頴初·顧靑瑤·吳靑霞皆是。尤以杏芬爲個中巨擘。茲不幸以北鸞西逝聞。德音未遠。猶有能述其梗槪者。杏芬嘗與人論畫。謂畫之佳劣。不在粗與細。粗中當有細意。細中當有寫生意。便是上品。草晶鳥獸。求其趣韻。不求其酷肖。酷肖則動物標本已盡其能事。何必求諸丹靑。畫中以花卉爲最易。人物爲最難。故對客揮毫者。大都爲花卉。罕作人物。然人物中之無量壽佛。亦殊易爲。一三角角黍。上置一龍眼。便具佛態。言時且點染爲之。其雋妙有如此。或詢其時流以夷葩異獸入畫。對之作感想。杏芬曰。古人作畫。本尙寫生。古時未有。古人不能畫。今世習見。今人不妨畫。聞者歎服，杏芬又曰。畫與人品有關。品高者畫自超逸。品卑者畫自劣濁。故與其論其畫。　寗論其品之爲得也。杏芬有閨侶某。倩杏芬畫一桃　。杏芬性懶。雖頻索而未加揮藻。某反覺難於再催。然欲得之心甚亟。一日。有餽某以肥城桃一筐者。其即移之以贈杏芬。肥城桃　肌絳膚。爪微破之。漿液流溢。可盡吮之而祗留皮核。魯省之名產也。杏芬啖之大喜。憶及桃　。遂立繪以報。神來之筆。逈異尋常。某珍之如瑰寳云。</p>

<p>醉·痴·生·</p>
<p>「我之約」們俩現因兩情相契。特互訂白頭這幾句冠冕堂皇。充满着快樂色彩的話。在報紙雙雙訂婚的告白上。時常可以瞧見。夫「白頭」者。就是「白頭偕老。的意思。眞是名正言順。有始有終。何等吉利。但是現在心急的人居多。往往等不到頭白。早已勞燕分飛。各自東西。試看報紙所載。離婚之案。何日蔑有。如旣訂未結而離婚者有之。朝結婚而暮離婚者有之。子女成行。而請求離異者又有之。大人先生要離婚。江北縫窮婦也要離婚。離婚之潮愈亟。吃素之人愈多。（離婚與離葷諧音。離了葷。當然是吃素。一笑）白頭之約何在。白首之期難俟。照這樣歐風東漸。互相效尤。恐怕將來鴛鴦譜中。能夠相依終身。互守「白頭之約」的眞要寥若晨星了。所以依在下看來。以後「白頭兩字。與其有名無實。還是取消的好。否則「白」字換一個「黑」字。較爲穩當。或者「白頭」改爲「袁頭」二字。倒也很妙。因爲「袁頭」是件好東西。也是愛情的代價。等到床頭金盡。便要白眼相看。也未嘗没有。這就呌做「互訂袁頭之約。」但究竟妥不妥。還要請有心人研討一下吧。哈哈。</p>

<p>現商業雖云不振。而華人在海外收入。對祖國供給尙屬可驚。據云前月閩僑匯寄厦門之欵。至四百萬元。因盾貴之故。從前一盾半易華一元。今八十元匯一百元故也。又閩省共產亂事甚烈。南洋有親友者。紛紛南下。蓋海外一尾閶無異秦時桃源矣。</p>
<p>緬人近亦刻用農業機器。從英國買來。各鄕有試用者。聞其價四千元。仰光爲中心埠。有米較廠以碾米。有鋸木廠玻璃廠等。但無鐵廠。人云英人未肯大啟緬人之智識。恐智高則難以馭伏人。</p>
<p>緬甸满街牛車。其駕法與華異。乃用一牛。以横木置兩年項上。另以兩直木接車箱。與横木爲十字架式。而甚罕見。馬至熱帶已無驢矣。此駕法皆印族加拉人爲之。其印度式耶。吾往者讀詩言六　在手。則古者駕六馬。在中國江准無從見之。比在直隷偶見。尙有駕六馬者。然　馬克波羅遊記之照片。則元代曾有駕十四馬者。蓋稀見也。印度　羅之駕用象。北極寒人駕用鹿及狗。今歐洲婦女則駕飛艇矣。進化哉。進化哉。</p>
<p>仰光生活甚高。過於星洲及檳城。本來幣制以盧比計算。甚不適用。因按其生活超過盧比之値甚遠。故一盧比甚不稱用也。如在星洲。一元可買郵票一百分。而此處一盧比只買十六分。相差遠矣。不過盧比之價尙高於華幣。此間各小學敎員之薪水。尙有一百盧比者。即此一蒙館假亦可月收八九十盧比。（即一盾）故比之中國之貧荒。尙不爲薄矣。在盧比制乃印度之幣。印度生活較低於南洋。在印度爲適用也。</p>
<p>九月中有十日間。此間發生基督敎與佛敎之衝突。西敎士大恐慌。其由生於仰光大學主持者。欲緬學生信基督敎。語言有失憸之事。遂大生誤會。緬生數百人。均退學。發出宣言。學生羣聚宿於大金塔上。因之各地傳敎者均受影響。最後調停西人道歉。始復上課。蓋緬人亦有日見進步之象。遇事不退讓。但西人在東方勢力從亞洲各國觀察。亦有月满則昃之勢。砲艦商業政策不行。宗敎亦難取勝。意者將有第三新文化起而代之。尙非東西互攻之說也。第三新文化應負調和之責。以致世界於太平乎。</p>

<h3 id="c181">南荒民族 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>魏覺忠著　曼·引·</p>
<p>大家都知道現在是二十世紀文明進化的時代、是由石器鐵器進而到機器的時代、在此時代中的人類社會組織、也由原始共產社會、封建社會變爲工業社會了、在歐美·日本·中國的大都市上、我們看見了那高入雲霄的洋房、繁華燦爛街市、汽車·電車·跳舞廳·遊戲塲、無一不窮奢極慾、供人使用·娱樂、極顯物質進步之能事、在鄕村中、尤其在號稱古國的我們中國的鄕村中、現在也很明顯的起了劇烈的變化、一種與往日古舊的、樸素的、不同的變化、無論在政治上、經濟上、只要我注意、都可以覺得到、</p>
<p>總之、在現代社會裏、無論是在都市、在鄕村、在歐美、在東亞、差不多整個的地球上、全令我們覺得人類社會是經過了很多的變遷、由舊社會的胚胎進到新社會的形式的變遷、慢慢地才有今日了、無疑的、這變遷是人類文化的進步、是社會制度的發展、所以在我們這個同一的地球上、同一的時代裏、很難令我們相信還遺存有幾千年以前、像我們祖宗那樣未開化的人類、未進步的社會呵、</p>
<p>然面、朋友們、我們來看看魏覺忠君著的這本南荒民族罷、看這本書内所記載的南洋土人的生活、以與我們所謂進化的人類相比、該發生若何感想、</p>
<p>魏君是位旅行家、抱有旅行世界的大志、先後在南漂泊七年、所以本書不僅使他自己有「書中所述、均據著者親身聞見所及、自信較諸足未履南洋而竟侈談南洋者不同」之满、即令我們讀者、也决不會覺得是誰編的故事在向我們撒謊、　　全書分二卷、上卷記述荷　巴布亞島的生番加雅人之生活狀况、下卷記述蘇門答蠟島東海岸州與打班奴利之間哇答民族、每卷包含很多可以獨自分開的短篇、這、大槪是著者在旅行倉忙時所記下的、我們可以不必「吹毛求疵」、責備他没有整理爲有系統的章節、其實、要這樣才眞能　保存夾叙夾議的遊記體與興趣哩、</p>
<p>在上卷開始三篇、告訴了我們、加雅人日日歌舞的快樂生活、加雅的地勢與所屬之國家、及其名稱之由來、隨後展開到加雅人奇異的風俗上來、如加雅女人眼中之如意郎君、並不是漂亮、有錢、有地位、乃是要殺人殺得多的英雄、加雅人結婚、新婦須先給奉獻親朋、第二日還要給鄰近的老輩尊輩去享受、在結婚前二三日、新郎請了兩位親朋、把新婦拿來作試騐品、這些、不都是我們認爲怪事嗎、</p>
<p>其他還有許多我們從來所未聽過的、像原始土夫一樣的習慣、如「生與殺」、「加雅人的數學」、「是好身手」、「幕天席地」、「天災」、「無政府狀態」等篇内所述的、茲爲篇幅所限、不詳、</p>
<p>第二卷叙述哇答人、一如首卷、不過在事實上、哇答人的生活習慣有許多與加雅人不相同、如加雅人可以共其妻、哇答人則絕對不准、哇答人的未婚女可以同任何男子調情、（同姓者不在此例）而加雅人則不、哇答人有姓氏、知種稻、貯蓄、加雅人則一槪不能、在「自由戀愛的實行者」篇裏、叙述哇答少女戀愛生活、頗爲我們所奇異、因爲無論在地方的人類性生活、大多數是男子主動、女子被動、哇答少女則不然、</p>
<p>統觀第二卷所記述的哇答民族、較第一卷中加雅人要進化多了、因爲前者似乎到了遊獵畜牧耕植時期、而後者則仍滯留在初民只知採取自然界動植物爲生的時期中、然而以與我們歐亞人民、進步到使用機器時期相比、又將如何呢、在目今、同一的地球上、一部份人類進化到火輪、飛機、差不多是電氣時代、另一部份人類仍滯留在源始初民的生活中、魏君今將那部份尙滯留在初民的生活中的人類、其風俗、其習慣、舉以筆之於書、誠如爲本書作序的鄭洪年先生說「足供世界人類學與風俗學家研究之資」、劉士木先生說「其裨益於治社會學者、豈淺鮮哉、」的話呵、</p>
<p>在另一方面、本書對於華僑在南洋受外人的虐待、與淪落的情形的記載、也很能刺激我們讀者的民族意識、關於這、作者雖没有専篇論及、然在字裏行間可以看得出來的、是丨</p>
<p>「······荷官禁止華僑去抬椰子、···」</p>
<p>頁七四、</p>
<p>「······凡華人娶加雅婦、一律强令離婚、所生的兒女、亦强迫贈給生番、···」頁七五、</p>
<p>「···歐戰後荷人至其屬地大起其所謂（卅巴仙）的戰稅、···華僑因此而破產者、遂多至不可勝數、」同頁、</p>
<p>「荷屬各處、鴉片皆由政府公賣、吸鴉片者、十之九爲我華僑、每年耗至千萬盾、」七六頁、</p>
<p>「我們貴同胞在南洋失踪的、有如恒河沙數、但是從來有誰去究問過呢、」下卷四頁、</p>
<p>這是如何沉痛的呼聲呵、在「生番的奴僕」（六九頁）一篇裏述及華僑與生番交易困難情形眞是可憐極了、</p>
<p>近數年我國政府漸漸洋意到南洋華僑、有很多立志研究南洋旅行南洋的人、坊問也出版有幾本關於南洋的著作、可是我還没有見過一本像本書材料這麽豐富、記載這麽詳細呢、那麽、本書也很可以供研究南洋文化的一本參考書、</p>
<p>著者文筆活潑、辭句新鮮、叙述簡明、語氣流俐、書中散見古詩幾首圖畫多幀、那麽、本書也可以作一本故事小說讀、　　聽說魏君現在還着手抄第三第四···卷關於旅行所得的記載、而且不久即預備出發到東北、漫遊全國並全世界、在這兒、我們誠懇地祝他成功、</p>

<h3 id="c182">美育的實施 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>唐·雋·</p>
<p>「美育」這兩個字、在國人的眼裏和筆頭上似乎都常常發現着、一般人似乎對他也有種相黨的重視、然而美育實施的成績在那裏、對民衆和藝術家所發生的效用在那裏、我們一想到這兩個問題、我們總會爲着美育這條大道之久不開發抱恨起來、</p>
<p>作者在此向大家談述「美育、」不僅希望讀者對於我所談的表示相當的或熱烈的同情、還要希望你們擴大你們的同情、對於美育的實施作一種强有力的運動、</p>
<p>「美育」有兩個意義、（一）對民衆說丨爲藝術普遍化、藝術社會化、藝術欣賞化、再拿一般的說法是、美化人生、美化社會、（二）對藝術家說丨爲藝術専門化、藝術創作化、一般的說法、呌這做「藝術敎育、」第一點是要使社會民衆有一種普遍的「美意識」之養成和藝術「欣賞力」之養成、第二點是要使藝術家有一種普遍的「美意識」之養成和専門的藝術「創作力」之養成、所謂「美育」包括得有這兩個意義、這、是在受動方面看才有「民衆的」和「藝術家的」這種區别、而在發動方面看、却又是一體的、</p>
<p>我們對民衆實施美育、不是要使民衆個個都成爲藝術家、是要使一般的民衆都有欣賞藝術的能力和趣味、以及一般的社會都得有一種「美的意識」的灌輸、一般的人生、都得受一種「美的意識」的浸潤、不管是公共的集團或個人的住所、社會的習尙、或個人的舉止、都應得籠罩以一種「美的空氣、」換句話說、即是使社會藝術化、生活美術化、</p>
<p>我們對藝術家實施美育、不是拿同樣的模型、把他們印成千篇一律的樣子、也不是拿着同一實施的法則、聽他們走上同一的道路、是應得把藝術家那種偉大的靈魂、引入眞眞藝術偉大的園地、是應得把藝術家所需要之廣博的要素、廣博地陳列在藝術家的面前、使他們的内延和外包、心理與身理、受着這般、環境材料的潛移和默化、他們的心靈會孕育成一種美的意想、他們的眼與手自會構成一種絕大的技能、鎔和他們這種美的意想與技能、便構成一種藝術創作的强力、一切藝術品都是由這種强力所營造成的、</p>
<p>上面所說施於民衆的美育、一般人大槪容易理會、至於施於藝術家的美育、似乎便不是一般人所易理解的了、這并一是不理解、是不注意丨是他們一向没有注意到這個問題、他們把關於藝術家的美育、另呼爲「藝術敎育、」他們把施行於民衆的美育、才是他們所習用的、呼喊的「美育、」這因之便在藝術敎育中造成一個極大的罪案、丨美術學校之設置、在藝術開展的大道上、樹立了一個極大的障碍物、（詳拙著「美術學校之將來」）</p>
<p>實施美育的人、最要的是先認定美育的標準、不管是實施於民衆也好、實施於藝術家身上也好、只要發動者具有相當的信念、受動者自也會得着一種相當的效果、</p>
<p>美育實施的痕跡、我們可從近代歐西之美術國家找出許多例證來、（參看「埃爾佛雜誌」拙作「法蘭西藝術開展的途徑」）</p>
<p>第一、我們可以從他們公共城市的組織上看出、丨關於公共城市的組織上有公園有紀念塲、有建築物、在雕刻品、有裝飾物、有公園的設置、可以調劑城市之囂雜、右以陶養一般民衆曠適的感情、有紀念場建築物雕刻品等、可以引起民衆以一種歷史的意念、和映象於民衆以一種造形藝術的輪廓、其他還有博大的、美術院旣可供一般人的欣賞、又可供藝術天才家之研究、美術展覽員也有同樣的功用、音樂館、劇塲、旣能使民衆得直接的享受生理上和精神上的愉快、又能使藝術家得於無形中大受其感染以完成其創作、如戈洛（Ｃｏｒｏｔ）的幽情色調、多得受巴黎國家音樂館（Ｏｐｅｒａ）佈景的影響、因戈氏常到音樂館去聽戲、還有露天的音樂會、更可以使一般平民和無產的藝術家得享受相當的美的意識底陶醉、和誘起天才家易感性的共鳴、诸如此類充满着城市社會之美的環境藝術的環境、都是美育實施的好成績、和實施美育所憑借的好資料、</p>
<p>第二、我們可從私人的住宅與服飾上看出、丨歐西人的住宅、可說都是美術化、我們拿他們的勞動工人方面來看、都是秩序井然、客廳裝飾、也能盡其所得力爲點綴、我們一入他們那種小巧玲瓏的客廳、我們回想到中國人羣的紛亂、中華民族的無美術思想、確是形成一文明一野蠜顯着的區别了、他們中上等家庭、更有輝煌的别墅、圍以園林、春夏花木盛發、居住其間、儼若置身極樂世界、比較更有錢的人、也不惜重金、裝飾他們的居宅、（作者曾見一法人在法國迪朗裝飾工廠定做客廳一全套、桌椅墻壁及一切應用物品在内、耗法幣一百五十餘萬、約値現行國幣三十萬元、造此客廳費時有十個月之久、）可見歐西人對於藝術之重視和欣好、作者還可說法國人的美術嗜好、常與其經濟情勢平衡發展、我們到法國中部洛瓦河（Ｌｏｉｒｅ）流域一帶去看那些王宮的修造和其内部裝飾、我們便可知道中世紀法蘭西王族美術嗜好之高潮、其他一般平民也能依其經濟的情勢、作其美術的享樂、我們直可說法蘭西民族的「美術欣賞力」是陶養得十扫普通的、　　我們再拿他他服飾來看丨尤其是婦人小孩、都是非常的美術化、尤以跳舞劇塲的衣紋、日新月易、可謂盡其綺麗艷美之能、他們的日常服飾、有専門家終日設計窮追、逐時更翻、於此更可以見他們對於美術嗜好之酷、然而他們這種深厚的「美意識」之養成、不是偶然的、是經過了一番有歷史性、有社會性的美化敎育所構成的、他們這般美化敎育、彼此源流循環助長、而造成一種牢不可破的「中堅意識、」爲社會放雍和之氣、爲人類開美麗之花、</p>
<p>法蘭西人有了以上種種的美術環境、所以他們不談美化民衆、而民衆自會美化、他們不談藝術敎育、而天才自會成爲藝術家、在法國社會、嬰孩自出胎以後、即有佈满了他們周圍的雍和的零圍氣、和映照於他們面龐和眼簾的美麗之花、他們從小時就有家庭的良好環境、一出門就有公園、就有娱樂的正當遊戲塲、就有佈满了市　的雕刻品、繪畫、建築物、及其他一切實用裝飾品、來誘惑他們的眼簾、來煽動他們的情緒、來陶養他們的美的心靈、</p>
<p>我們看了上面所述、便可知道實施美育應得創造美的環境、藝術的環境、如公園的設置、美術館、音樂院、劇塲建造、以及一切城市家庭的雕繪裝飾、其他還有知慧的灌輸、自然美的浸潤等等、都是實施美育的人們所應注意的、這些關於美的和藝術的直接或間接的環境、都是實施美育之必要的工具、</p>
<p>萬龍（Ｖｅｒｏｎ）先生有段關於美育極有價値的話、他說「應得開展靑年們、到各種美的情緒之田園裏去、用各種方法來煽動那爲造成藝術之眞源泉底那種道德强力」（ＰｕｉｓｓａｎｃｅＭｏｒａｐｅ）的擴張、精細他們的感官、驚起他們的胎意、熱燒他們的意想、拿一般英氣來親近他們、拿各種的藝術品來飼養他們、敎示他們領悟人和人類社會的偉大、把他們安放在使他們最易生起「美感」和「詩興」景况的面前、最後用各種形態來常常使他們的眼與耳得受一種特殊的快樂丨一種純粹的「美的快樂」、（Ｊｏｕｉｓｓａｎｃｅｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｐｕｅ）」丨見萬龍（Ｖｅｒｏｎ）所著之「美學」（ＬＥｓｔｈｅｔｉｐｕｅ）之體裁論、」丨這些話句句都是實施美育的指導者、我們根據這些話來作實施美育的根據、是不會有錯的、</p>
<p>中國一向談美育和實施美育的人、對於上面所述那種廣大而普遍的美育、注意的實在很少、不是僅在師範科中學裏面談幾門圖畫音樂和手工科、便是爭先恐後的去開辦、美術學校、他們只知道拿那般敎授式的課程、來作實施美育的方便、用這種偏桔畸形的美育實施法、作者敢斷言再過若干年還是不會有多大的效果、對民衆旣不能養成他有一種普遍的美的觀念和興味、對天才又不能使他養成爲専門的藝術家、這種實施美育的方法、實在是急待改變的、</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After its establishment, the Control Yuan plans to emulate the Qing Dynasty's method of dividing the country for censorate purposes. The country will be divided into several supervisory regions, either with one province as a region or two or three provinces combined. Each region will have a supervisory commissioner appointed by the National Government upon the recommendation of the President of the Control Yuan. Members of the Control Yuan may also serve concurrently. Each region will have a supervisory commissioner's office to regularly inspect various locations within the region. The draft plan has been prepared by the Planning Committee and will be carefully discussed after all members take office, before being submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation.

<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan's methods for impeaching officials include: first, complaints from the people; and second, impeachments initiated by members of the Control Yuan. For complaints from the people, three members of the Control Yuan will be designated to investigate and, if the allegations are confirmed, an impeachment will be initiated and submitted to the Committee on the Discipline of Officials for execution. Impeachments initiated by members of the Control Yuan must be co-signed by three members and then referred by the Control Yuan to another three members for joint investigation before being submitted. The Control Yuan will absolutely maintain confidentiality regarding the people's accusations against officials. When an impeachment is initiated, the impeaching members of the Control Yuan will be directly responsible to the accused. The Committee on the Discipline of Officials will determine the sanctions to be imposed on the accused, which include removal from office, demotion, reduction in pay, demerit, and warning. Except for specially appointed officials, who will be submitted to the National Government for execution, the remaining sanctions will be executed by the responsible superior officer.

<p>The Central Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group Schedules Regular Discussions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group is scheduled to meet again on the 17th to discuss the overall plan for negotiations with Russia. Before Wang Zhengting went to Shanghai on the 12th morning, he notified Mo Dehui to return to attend the meeting on the 16th. It is reliably learned that Mo Dehui, Sun Ke, Hu Hanmin, and Wang Chonghui conducted detailed research at Sun's residence on the 11th evening on the three issues of resumption of communications and trade with Russia and the aftermath of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which lasted until late at night. Regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, the principle is to recover or redeem it. At a minimum, China and Russia must temporarily have equal rights in employing personnel and administering the railway. As for the issue of commerce, it has in fact been partially restored in the provinces of the East and Xinjiang. Furthermore, the Shanghai branch of the Far Eastern Bank has resumed operations, and a large number of Russian tea bricks have recently arrived in Shanghai for sale. Therefore, from a partial to a complete restoration, there are in fact not many problems left. Also, regarding the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, some within the central government advocate that it should be considered after the completion of the suppression of the communists throughout the country. It is heard that the Foreign Affairs Group of the Central Political Council may decide on the principles on the 17th. The Department of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already prepared a complete document on the specific measures, which will be handed over to Mo to take to Moscow as a reference for negotiations.

<p>(Taiyuan) The commanders of the armies are currently discussing and requesting that Xi Yan and others telegraph Zhang Zuoxiang, hoping to quickly resolve the problems of the railway protection army and the security forces.

<p>(Beijing) Those who came from Shanxi said that the conscription of various armies in southern Shanxi is increasing, and the people's donkeys, horses, and stored grain are being transported away. The county magistrates have no solutions, and the gentry do not dare to appeal. The armies are still recruiting soldiers to fill vacancies. Even if the central government provides sufficient funds, it is difficult to expect the armies to actually reduce their numbers. The reason for this is that the officers below the rank of battalion and regimental commanders do not want to reduce their own power. When there are vacancies, they fill them at any time, regardless of whether there is pay or not. If there is no pay, they conscript locally. The people of Shanxi do not know where they will die.

<h3 id="e32">The Silver Question <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Today, the silver question is recognized as one of the important issues in the world, just as the unemployment problems and disarmament issues of various countries are being researched by insightful individuals.</p>
<p>For example, the content of the US Pittman's Silver Relief Report, as it is rumored, includes: 1. Opening negotiations with England to end the policy of dumping Indian silver on the world market. 2. Holding an international conference to seek an understanding to use silver as a subsidiary currency. 3. Providing international silver loans to China. Whether these three things can be done, and whether they will benefit the price of silver, cannot be predicted now.</p>
<p>Another example is Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China's discussion on the silver price issue. His main points are: 1. Silver-producing countries must have a spirit of sacrifice and implement restrictions on production. 2. Silver-producing countries must stop selling. 3. The United States must allow the redemption of unlimited partial loans under a certain ratio of silver to gold. 4. All countries should assist China in adopting the gold standard, and countries that have already adopted the gold standard should use the silver standard as a subsidiary currency. 5. A few countries must sign agreements not to sell or lend their existing silver. All these five points may be the same as Pittman's Silver Relief Report or adopt the opinions of people from other countries. But the most important point is that someone must be willing to sacrifice themselves. This is really one of the most difficult things in the world today.</p>

<h3 id="e59">German Foreign Minister Delivers Important Foreign Policy Speech <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Friendship with France is the Only Pivot for European Peace</p>
<p>Success or Failure of Disarmament is the Touchstone of the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Young Plan Currently Cannot be Fully Guaranteed</p>
<p>Motion by Extremists Rejected</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 11th - German Foreign Minister Curtius delivered a foreign policy report in the Reichstag today, with the main theme being Germany's consistent adherence to a conciliatory policy and strict compliance with existing treaties. He first described his experiences attending various conferences of the League of Nations in Geneva, then discussed important issues, stating that Germany has always held a positive attitude towards the European Federation plan, but insists that Russia must be included. Today, to resolve the difficulties of all of Europe, the first step is to seek the unity of European countries, and Franco-German friendship is the real pivot. He hopes that the obstacles to the previous progress of friendship between the two countries can be eliminated soon. Our demands fully consider the interests of others and are easily resolved in peaceful and friendly negotiations. Most Germans are prepared to accept new methods of cooperation and new ways of a European Federation, but they also firmly oppose rebuilding Europe on the basis of the collapse of Germany. As for the issue of disarmament, requiring other countries to disarm with equal reductions is Germany's inherent right. The degree of security we demand is no different from that of other governments. If other governments claim the right to prepare defense plans to protect their territories, we should also demand the same right. The upcoming Disarmament Conference will be a test of the life and death of the League of Nations. If it fails, the League will also lose its right to exist. Although there is much that can be criticized about the League's current performance, we should not withdraw from it. If, in the future, the League cannot resolve issues of great importance to our country, then we should change course. Finally, regarding the reparations issue, he said that Germany has not guaranteed the full and reliable implementation of the Young Plan. He believes that the reparations issue will eventually be resolved practically sooner or later. The German people are groaning and haggard under the heavy burden of reparations and will not be able to survive. However, there are already reasons to believe that the world is gradually understanding this truth. Haste makes waste, so we have to weigh the situation and find ways to reduce our burden. This is the urgent task of foreign policy. During Curtius' speech, government party members repeatedly cheered and applauded, while Communist Party members repeatedly shouted in an attempt to obstruct the speech. As for the National Socialist Party and the National People's Party, because they believe that amending the rules of procedure violated the constitution, they no longer attended the meeting to protest when the new rules were implemented.</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 11th - As a result of the German Reichstag's foreign policy debate, a motion of no confidence in Foreign Minister Curtius was rejected by 255 votes to 86, with 29 abstentions. Motions to dissolve the Reichstag and withdraw from the League of Nations, proposed by extremists, were also rejected by similar majorities. It is rumored that the National Socialist Party will demand the convocation of a National Assembly regarding the two issues.</p>
<p>National Society, Paris, 11th - Great attention is being paid here to the German Foreign Minister's speech in the Reichstag. Most of the left-wing newspapers expressed sympathy, saying that his wording was very clear and understandable. Le Figaro said that his speech contained three major expressions: (1) Germany is willing to remain in the League of Nations and continue to cooperate with it; (2) Although Germany does not guarantee the permanent implementation of the Young Plan, it does not want to abolish the plan lightly; (3) Recognition of Franco-German diplomacy as the cornerstone of German foreign policy. L'Echo de Paris said that the French Foreign Ministry also made a similarly clear declaration. Le Petit Parisien said that Curtius' speech contained a declaration, although there was nothing new, it added a kind of strength to the usual German arguments. This kind of strength may not be able to increase Franco-German relations as Curtius had hoped. It is expected that this speech was made out of concern for domestic politics.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Japanese Acting Prime Minister Baron Shidehara Retracts Misstatement <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Parliamentary Storm Comes to an End</p>
<p>Opposition Party Decides on Second Step Strategy</p>
<p>Mood in the House of Peers is Unfavorable to the Government</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 12th - After days of turmoil, the House of Representatives Budget Committee opened at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th. Members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties and observing parliamentarians were very calm when entering the venue, as the issue had already been resolved. At 11:35 a.m., Chairman Takeuchi also entered and took his seat, but neither Baron Shidehara nor any of the ministers were seen. All members remained silent. At 12:02 p.m., the chairman announced the opening of the meeting, and immediately adjourned for a recess until 1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Japan United Press - At 1:30 p.m. on the 12th, the Budget Committee reconvened. Chairman Takeuchi asked for understanding for the extension of the budget deliberation period. Baron Shidehara, looking somewhat pale, read a prepared draft, saying, "Regarding Mr. Nakajima's question about the ratification of the London Treaty, I made a misstatement in my answer, and I hereby retract it in its entirety." Next, Toshio Shimada said, "Regarding Acting Prime Minister Shidehara's misstatement, it will no longer be pursued in this meeting, but it must be stated today that any words or actions that violate the fundamental principles of constitutional government, now or in the future, will not be tolerated in the slightest." He also said, "It is rumored that Prime Minister Hamaguchi has recently made great progress and has recovered his health. Judging from the greeting letters that Mr. Hamaguchi sent to various parties, he clearly stated that he may come to the Diet in person. It can be imagined. It is a breach of loyalty for an ailing Prime Minister to let the Acting Prime Minister act on state affairs." The turbulent misstatement issue thus came to an end.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 12th - Because Acting Prime Minister Shidehara retracted his misstatement today, the chaos in the parliament has formally returned to calm. However, the Seiyukai will move to the second stage of its strategy. In the future, it will pursue the government's responsibility with legal tactics, even arguing that Baron Shidehara has absolutely no qualifications to act as Prime Minister in terms of law and politics, and that such a serious misstatement has caused great obstacles to the progress of constitutional government, making him the most incompetent person in constitutional politics. They are preparing to submit a motion for impeachment of Acting Prime Minister Shidehara or a memorial before the budget proposal is submitted to the plenary session. In addition, the Seiyukai plans to pursue the government's responsibility for extending the budget deliberation period, which was not caused by natural disasters, and at the same time expose Interior Minister Adachi's detective politics and fiercely attack the government, preferring death to dishonor.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 12th - A summary of the opinions of various factions in the House of Peers on Acting Prime Minister Shidehara's retraction of his misstatement is as follows: The Koyu Club and other anti-government factions said that since Baron Shidehara knew that it was a misstatement and retracted it, his responsibility is very serious, and the House of Peers cannot take it lightly. The government faction said that since it has been retracted, the problem has disappeared, and if the House of Peers continues to pursue it, it will only complicate the political struggle. The neutral faction said that although the House of Peers cannot approve of pursuing Baron Shidehara's responsibility, the government's responsibility is indeed heavy and great for causing great obstacles to the proceedings and for succumbing to violence, which shows that the policy is not fixed. Therefore, the general mood in the Upper House is increasingly unfavorable to the government due to the misstatement issue. If Prime Minister Hamaguchi cannot attend, important bills will inevitably be adversely affected.</p>
<h3 id="e61">British Conservative Party Moves to Impeach Government <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Rejected in the Lower House</p>
<p>Snowden Stresses Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>All Cabinet Members Willing to Take a 10% Salary Cut</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - The Conservative Party moved to impeach the government in the House of Commons tonight for excessively increasing expenditures. After a long debate, the House of Commons rejected the Conservative Party's motion by 310 votes to 235. The Liberal Party voted with the government.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - After the Conservative Party's Evans moved to impeach the government for excessively increasing expenditures, Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden spoke in the House of Commons, saying that the national situation was very serious and that it was necessary to adopt harsh and unpopular methods to maintain the balance of the budget and facilitate the recovery of industry. Expenditures that are easy to get away with in prosperous times are impossible in an era of industrial recession and when it is impossible to raise taxes. It is undeniable that the budget deficit at the end of the current fiscal year will be large. In the past year, unemployment in Britain has increased greatly, and no budget in any country in the world can withstand this unexpected burden. Expenditures have increased and revenues have decreased, and productivity has fallen by 12%. However, Britain's credit is higher today than at any time in the past five years. Among the major industrial countries affected by industrial depression, Britain is less affected. However, there is a point in Britain's position that is easily damaged, that is, Britain is the largest financial center in the world, and other countries are watching Britain. Therefore, Britain must maintain its financial reputation. No country in the world considers Britain to be more stable. What Britain needs now is to work hard to overcome the current difficulties. Britain does not need much effort, but it needs temporary sacrifices from all parties. Cabinet members will make a real contribution in the general sacrifice. Liberal Party member Maclaren advocated appointing a small independent committee to propose practical and legal ways to reduce national expenditures. Conservative Party member Young said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer's remarks were the most serious announcement since the Great War, but they were still not sufficient to answer the impeachment case. Conservative Party member Horne said that the current difficulties are due to high wages and high taxes. The huge amount of money that Britain is currently spending cannot be afforded even by the richest country in the world. There must be large-scale austerity and large-scale deductions, either reducing wages or reducing taxes. The government must make a decision. (The Labor Party shouted to reduce war debts.) The impeachment case was not established due to the government's majority of 75 votes. The Liberal Party's motion to appoint a small committee to propose methods to reduce expenditures was later passed by a majority of members.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - After the Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke tonight, many people speculated about who should make sacrifices. The public generally believes that all civil servants must have their salaries reduced. Labor Party members are worried that employers will use Snowden's remarks as an excuse. At the same time, workers in several industries have stated that there is no reason to cut wages. According to general opinion, Snowden warned his party that large-scale social projects are impossible. In any case, tonight's remarks are bound to cause a serious backlash within the Labor Party. This is beyond doubt. Furthermore, the Conservative Party's final speaker in the debate tonight was Horne, not Churchill. It can be seen that Churchill has disagreed with Baldwin on the India issue and has now ceded the financial seat in the future Conservative cabinet to Horne.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th - Today's news is that British cabinet members have agreed to take a 10% salary cut, in response to Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden's request last night that cabinet members will make a contribution in the general sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Pittman's Silver Relief Report Content <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Making Three Recommendations to the U.S. Senate</p>
<p>Advocating the Use of Silver Loans to Lend to China to Develop Businesses</p>
<p>Negotiations with Britain to End Dumping of Indian Silver in the World</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 12th - The committee that has been studying methods to improve trade with China and restore silver prices in the past year has published its report. According to yesterday's news, the committee made three recommendations to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At the same time, Senator Pittman introduced a bill in the Senate requesting President Hoover to implement the recommendations. Pittman also stated that he will ask the Foreign Relations Committee to discuss it immediately. The three recommendations are as follows: (1) Open negotiations with Britain to end the policy of dumping Indian silver on the world market; (2) Convene an international conference to seek an understanding on the use of silver as currency; (3) Use international silver loans to lend to China. The report recommends that to prevent abuse, a silver syndicate can be organized, and silver is lent to China when needed to mint equivalent currency for paying wages and purchasing materials for peaceful projects approved by the syndicate, and those related to China's development and commerce can be asked to join the syndicate. The report also recommends that silver loans to China should be based on silver, not on silver coins, because their price is difficult to determine. The standard silver coins currently in the U.S. treasury can be used to provide loans to China.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 11th - The new committee of the Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Pittman, submitted a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today. This report can be called the Pittman Report, and its main points are as follows: (1) Express trust in the Chinese central government; (2) Advocate that the people of all relevant countries assist China's development projects; (3) Propose a huge silver loan to China; (4) Refute the claim that danger will arise if the Chinese government is not as stable as it is today; (5) Propose that silver loans to China should be delivered in silver, not in national currency; (6) Recommend how the United States should participate in international silver pooling to lend to China to finance construction projects.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 11th - The Pittman Report stated briefly that the committee unanimously believes that China currently has a good government and that Americans trading in China are satisfied. However, if the Chinese government does not receive spiritual, intellectual, and financial assistance from foreigners trading with it, it will be difficult to implement its peace and development plans. If the United States can help China develop all its industries and enrich the lives of the Chinese people, then American goods will surely sell well in the Chinese market in a few years. China's natural resources are very rich and will surely be able to meet its obligations. The amount of the loan to China should be limited to 200 million to 300 million ounces of raw silver. Some say that if the Nanjing government is not as stable as it is today, this loan will be in danger. It should be known that this matter is easy to resolve. Now, all countries should pool silver together and pay it to China when it requests funds to pay wages, purchase raw materials, or undertake construction projects. If the government's position is indeed able to repay the debt before payment, then there will be no other problems. This loan should be calculated in silver currency, not in yuan currency, to avoid China opposing it because the price is low when borrowing and high when repaying. The lending countries will also have no objection to this. The U.S. Treasury currently has 495 million yuan in silver coins, which should be used to lend a portion of this money to China.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 11th - Conservative Party member Wood asked in the House of Commons today about the negotiations to abolish consular jurisdiction in China. Foreign Secretary Henderson replied that London received China's answer on consular jurisdiction on December 24 last year. The British government has carefully studied it in order to send instructions to Minister Blue in China. Minister Blue can resume negotiations soon. As for the Chinese proposal, for the sake of public interest, he is not in a position to comment at this time.</p>

<p>France and Italy Express Pessimism</p>
<p>National Society, Paris, 11th - British naval expert Craigie arrived here from Rome and will visit French Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Briand, and various important political and military figures, hoping to make a final effort to reach a compromise on the issue of Italian-French naval parity. Those close to the British Embassy here all hope that both Italy and France can accept mediation so that Britain will not be forced to change its attitude towards the naval treaty. It is reported that France's inclusion of a new 23,000-ton cruiser in this year's shipbuilding program will also occupy an important place in Craigie's discussions. However, French newspapers mostly express extreme pessimism about Craigie's trip, and several newspapers strongly advocate that France and Italy suspend their agreement to build ships for five months. Since the agreement expired on January 1, the losses suffered by France's naval armaments during these five months must be made up for at this time.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 11th - The trend of unemployment is spreading globally, and Germany is also suffering. The same is true for the United States. According to the newly released statistics, there were a total of 4,894,000 unemployed people in Germany on January 31. Unemployment among German trade union members accounted for one-fifth of the members. In July last year, more than 2,819,000 unemployed people were registered with the labor bureau, with construction, leather, and woodworking industries having the most unemployed. However, it is not known how many people were not registered last year, so the number of unemployed people did not suddenly increase by 2 million in half a year.</p>

<p>Associated Press, Menlo Park (Florala), 11th - Today, American inventor Thomas Edison celebrated his 84th birthday here. He invited reporters from national newspapers to participate in the celebration. There were many questions from the guests, and Mr. Edison answered them one by one without any fatigue. He declared to the public that during President Hoover's term, the administration has made great progress, and prohibition has also had a miraculous effect. He is a close friend of Hoover and also supports prohibition. He also said that in the current environment, the motives for international war are not lurking. At this point, he described his own experiments, saying that the rubber industry is a very important part of today's business. For the needs of the United States, it is necessary to invent an artificial rubber as a substitute. Mr. Edison is confident that it will be successful soon. As for the unemployment issue, Mr. Edison opposes the national government being fully responsible for relief, because he advocates that public interest is not the property of the locality. On that day, Mr. Edison was in high spirits and said that he works very hard every day, as usual for many years.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Specific Opinions of Mo Dehui on Negotiations with Russia <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Three Matters of the Eastern Railway, Resumption of Diplomatic Relations, and Trade</p>
<p>Mo Dehui recently spoke to reporters at the Central Hotel in Beijing about his specific opinions on negotiations with Russia, stating roughly that he had been in Beijing for a week, and had repeatedly discussed with the current authorities the policies to be adopted in dealing with negotiations with Russia. The principles will be decided by the Central Political Council, and the methods have been drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The crucial key lies in the three matters of the Eastern Railway, resumption of diplomatic relations, and trade. Whether these should be discussed separately or jointly is related to diplomatic secrets, and the Central Government is still carefully studying this. It is currently inconvenient to state this clearly. However, based on personal observations, Japan resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union six years ago, and Britain resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union two years ago. Both have progressed from resumption of diplomatic relations to trade. In reality, apart from a fisheries agreement regarding the railway, Britain and Japan have not established a formal trade treaty with the Soviet Union. Italy and Turkey have joined hands and formed ties with the Soviet Union, which must have an international background, forming a stage for European power plays. Turkey was once ravaged by British products five years ago. Why is it now friendly with the Soviet Union, and why does the Soviet Union not think of spreading communism? The key to this lies in the fact that when interests are at stake, ideologies can be relaxed. Soviet Russian goods can be sold freely in Turkey, bringing great economic benefits. The Soviet Union can then abandon the propaganda of its ideology in order to avoid affecting its industrial and commercial markets. The Soviet Union's attitude towards Xinjiang is also the same. I strongly urge the Central Government to send senior officials to Russia to investigate, and encourage people from all walks of life to go and inspect, so that Britain and America can have a deep understanding of whether a Sino-Russian alliance is good or bad. Regarding the Eastern Railway problem, I had already conducted concrete negotiations with Karakhan in Russia regarding the redemption of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union has already accepted the principle of our country's request to redeem the Eastern Railway and agreed to consider it. There are two goals for China's redemption of the Eastern Railway: first, to take profit as the premise, that is, in accordance with Article 2 of the Russo-Chinese Agreement, when the 60-year term of the railway expires, all the railway and all affiliated industries will be unconditionally recovered; second, to take sovereignty as the premise, that is, China will immediately prepare the price for redemption. According to the statistics of the board of directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the estimated value is 470 million yuan since the joint venture began. China can redeem it for half of this amount. However, according to the Soviet Russian calculations, it is another calculation. The current situation of the Eastern Railway is uneven in many places. Russian staff account for two-thirds, and Chinese staff account for one-third. The Russian director has great powers and can appoint staff below 200 yuan, and can handle expenditures below 20 million yuan. As for the board of directors, there are five Chinese and five Russians, but case files that are unfavorable to the Soviet Union are not countersigned by the Russian directors, and therefore do not come into effect. In the past, there were many defects in the agreement for managing the Eastern Railway. Now the focus is on redeeming the railway. The procedures and methods for this require our country to research and discuss with the Soviet Union. The problem of resuming diplomatic relations must not be handled carelessly. It all depends on whether our country and the Soviet Union can work together. The other side advocates that the Soviet Union is the most able to treat China equally in the world. Also, the first Sino-Soviet conference opened on October 11th of last year, precisely the day before Chiang returned to Beijing in triumph from the front line. The second Sino-Soviet conference opened on the day Director Zhang Jin entered Beijing. The Soviet Russian attitude in the previous five months was completely different from that in the following three months. I judged in Moscow that Feng and Yan would definitely be defeated and that the Northeast would definitely support the Central Government. Everyone, the unity of the country shows the close relationship between China's internal affairs and diplomacy, and also shows the possibility of resuming diplomatic relations between China and Russia. It only depends on whether the Soviet Union can actually abandon the propaganda of its ideology and progress from non-interference to mutual assistance. How difficult can this be? However, this matter is of great importance and may not be decided in a short period of time. As for all superficial agreements, etc., although they stipulate non-interference, they are of little use. How can we rely on a third country to guarantee that there will be no communist propaganda in China? The problem of trade is closely related to the border between China and Russia. In fact, Russian goods from Harbin are constantly arriving. The Soviet Union attaches importance to interests, and ideology is secondary. Whether our country should fully restore trade relations with the Soviet Union depends on how the need is taken as the sole standard. In the future, if it is considered necessary to restore trade, an absolutely equal trade treaty must be concluded. This still requires the government to decide on the overall plan, and especially to have a comprehensive statistics of the needed products using scientific methods. Otherwise, it would not be appropriate for the Soviet Union to have the right to take whatever it wants from Xinjiang, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Sun Lianzhong's Army's Departure Postponed Again <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>But Troop Trains Have Been Urged to Wait for Transportation</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui Arrives in Jinan to Discuss Defense</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Sun Lianzhong's 26th Route Army recently planned to depart on the 10th to suppress the communists in Jiangxi. However, as of the afternoon of that day, the government and various important figures had not received any telegrams regarding the actual departure of the army. Even the transportation department had not received any news from Jinan or Ning. According to Jinan and Ning telegrams, Sun's army began boarding the train on the morning of the 10th, but did not depart immediately. It was also heard that because Sun's army did not depart on the 5th, the Jinpu Railway changed the departure date to the 10th and borrowed a part of the seven troop trains transporting Sun's army to transport commercial goods between Yanzhou and Jinan. Because Sun's army was actually departing, they sent urgent telegrams to request the return of the trains. The Jinpu Railway returned the trains to Jinan and Ning in the afternoon of the 10th for Sun's army to use. However, on the 11th, the troops still had not departed, and those who had boarded the train got off again. Therefore, there is a saying here that Sun's army has temporarily postponed its departure.</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui, the commander-in-chief of the 15th Route Army, arrived in Jinan by special train from Tai'an at 8:10 pm on the 10th. Those traveling with him included Chief Counselor Hai Tao, Chief Secretary, Adjutant, and many others, as well as a platoon of guards. Li Zongbi, the chief of staff of the 3rd Route Army's General Headquarters, welcomed him at the station. After Li met with Ma, they took a car together to the Provincial Government to meet with Chairman Han Fuqu to discuss defense and bandit suppression. According to Ma, he had no important task in coming to Jinan this time. When reporters asked about the news of Sun Lianzhong's army's departure, he said that they had not yet departed. Li Zongbi also told reporters that part of Commander Sun's troops had departed some days ago, but the departure was not successful. They have not actually departed yet, but the date will not be delayed for too long. (11th)</p>

<p>Determined to Follow the Tianjin Agreement</p>
<p>Separate Compilation of the Railway Protection Army and the Garrison</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The news about the Jin Army's reduction has been widely spread and changed rapidly in the past few days. Not only are outsiders not aware of the truth, but even those involved in the matter have difficulty having a true and resolute opinion. At present, the Jin situation is indeed in a state where soldiers do not obey generals and the group is without a leader. Anyone who holds considerable strength naturally has his own considerable opinion. In addition, there must be meetings every day, and meetings must be deliberations. Since there are many opportunities for gatherings and discussions, new and newer opinions are easily generated. According to Ji Yiqiao, the different opinions of the Jin Army generals in the past few days mean that we, the personnel specially sent to supervise the demobilization, are often unsure. The complexity of its content can be seen. In summary, when the army commanders jointly sent telegrams, their fundamental opinions were about four points: (1) separation of military and civilian affairs, (2) phased demobilization, (3) abolition of the army commander system, and (4) changing the original ten armies of the Jin Army into ten divisions. The emergence of this opinion is partly because each army commander has his own factual difficulties, and partly because Shang, Xu, Yang, and Fu, who went to Tianjin to participate in the meeting, cannot but bear their considerable responsibilities. The crux of the matter has four points: (1) the army commanders believed that the four people, Shang et al., were all gloriously appointed as army commanders when they went to Tianjin, and those of us who did not go were all left out, (2) Shang Zhen was not only the chairman, but also the army commander and the director of the Civil Affairs Department, (3) Shang et al. did not solicit the opinions of the army commanders on the aftermath before leaving, and did not respect or accept the representations of the army commanders who had sent personnel to present their case several times upon their arrival in Tianjin, and (4) Shang, Xu, Yang, and Fu were appointed as army commanders, and the old army commanders were demoted to division commanders, and Li Fuying and Zhang Huizhao did not even have a division commander's position, so they were also dissatisfied. For these reasons, the Tianjin agreement could not be implemented smoothly. It was not until Xu Yongchang returned and mediated in many ways, coupled with the mediation of Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Zhang Hanjie, and Fu Cunhuai, that the two meetings of the headquarters were completed. The results obtained were only unilateral proposals. The final method still needs to be decided by the Northeast. Regarding the proposal of the military system, it was initially proposed to abolish the army commander system and take the division as the unit. The original ten armies were reduced to ten divisions, each division with six regiments, a total of sixty regiments, and compiled into the national army, directly subordinate to the Central Government. Then it was proposed to continue to follow the Tianjin agreement of four armies and eight divisions externally, and to still take the division as the unit internally, and to set up a military committee. Recently, it was proposed to compile a railway protection army and a garrison in addition to the four armies in accordance with the Tianjin agreement, each army with two divisions, each division with four regiments, and to set up three garrison commands in Taiyuan, southern Shanxi, and northern Shanxi, each command directly under the jurisdiction of two regiments. Whether the above three types can be implemented is another question, but they are still the relatively central opinions that have been formed after many meetings. Other large and small proposals are still too numerous to record. Until Jing Yaoyue, who was sent by the army commanders to Liaoning to meet with Zhang, returned and reported the true attitude of the Liaoning side, all parties believed that the general trend was irreversible and that the principle of the Tianjin agreement had to be adopted. Therefore, Shang, Xu, and Yang, together with Ji Yiqiao, Hu Yiling, and the representatives Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Yang Xiaoou, and Li Shengda, who were recommended by the army commanders and commanders, held a tripartite joint meeting at the Shanxi Hotel. After a long period of discussion, a final decision was made. As a result of the consultation, in addition to implementing the four armies and eight divisions system in accordance with the Tianjin agreement, the opinions of the army commanders were adopted to compile a railway protection army and a garrison. The military committee level was not discussed because it was an internal agency. The Jin situation, which had been in dispute for a long time, has now reached a considerable conclusion. The next day, Shang hosted a banquet for Ji, Hu, Xu, Yang, and the army commanders and commanders at his private residence. Everyone attended on time, which was quite a grand occasion. It was nominally a joint banquet, but it was no less than a celebration drama. In short, for the time being, it can certainly be said that the time is ripe.</p>
<p>As for the candidates for the army commanders and division commanders, the general decision is as follows: Shang Zhen, the commander of the 4th Army, is in charge of the two divisions of Yang Xiaoou and Feng Pengzhu; Xu Yongchang, the commander of the 5th Army, is in charge of the two divisions of Li Fuying and Yang Chengyuan; Yang Aiyuan, the commander of the 6th Army, is in charge of the two divisions of Yang Yaofang and Wang Jingguo; Fu Zuoyi, the commander of the 7th Army, is in charge of the two divisions of Li Shengda and Fu himself; Sun Chu is the commander of the Zhengtai Railway Protection Army, and Zhang Huizhao is the commander of the garrison. However, it was originally planned that the garrison would be directly under the jurisdiction of the garrison command, and Rong Honglu was planned to be the garrison commander. However, Rong told people that he was personally involved in this Jin situation dispute because he witnessed the elders of the three Jins being turned over and over in the mud, and his conscience could not bear it. Therefore, he did not hesitate to use his tongue to hope to pull them out of the water and put them on the mat. Personal honor and disgrace are not enough to be concerned about. Therefore, he has no intention of being the garrison commander proposed this time. However, he hopes that the elders of the three Jins have a reasonable solution so that he can feel at ease. For this reason, the garrison was assigned to Zhang Huizhao. As for the issue of taking office, Shang, Xu, and others advocated that the newly compiled army and division commanders should first send a telegram to take office, and then ask Deputy Commander Zhang for instructions on the decision-making measures. On the part of the generals, they insisted that after the plan decided by the consultations in recent days was telegraphed to the Northeast for approval and implementation, they would then send a telegram to take office, which seemed to be appropriate and appropriate. Therefore, on the 6th, the generals once again had a consultation at a certain commander's residence. It was heard that the principle was that they would take office at the same time after the Northeast approved it. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">A Major Inspection is Held in Xuzhou <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Forty-six Suspects of Smoking and Gambling are Arrested</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Wang Jun, the commander of the Jinpu Garrison, recently convened a joint conference of local circles and decided to implement a major inspection, which was handed over to the Xuzhou Military Police Inspectorate for execution. The garrison headquarters first stipulated the inspection regulations. On the morning of the 11th, Chen Xueshun, the director of the Military Police Inspectorate, invited representatives from various agencies to set off separately. They were divided into three groups: the first group inspected the area around the West Gate, and Liu Ruifeng, the battalion commander of the 7th Division's Engineering Battalion, sent a company to accompany them on guard; the second group inspected the area around the North Gate, and Xiao Weiliang, the battalion commander of the 7th Division's Transport Battalion, sent two companies to accompany them on guard; the third group inspected the area around the East Railway Station, and because the area was wider, it was further divided into three small groups for implementation. Nie Jingpin, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 38th Regiment of the 7th Division, led the entire battalion to accompany them on guard. In addition, each group was accompanied by a detachment sent by Yuan Zhengdong, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the Central Military Police stationed in Xuzhou, who was responsible for arresting criminals. The local police teams and public security teams were also divided into three groups to guide and guard. Eight officials from the Military Police Inspectorate and representatives from the county government, county party department, public security bureau, first district office, chamber of commerce, special party department of the 7th Division, and Jinpu Police Section, each led three groups of troops to carry out the inspection. The officials and representatives entered people's homes to inspect, and the military police troops waited outside the door. Along the roads inside and outside the city, the Engineering Battalion sent teams to add posts to make the inspection more thorough. The inspection was completed at noon, and temporary arrests were made. The first group arrested six people, the second group arrested six people, and the third group arrested thirty-four people. Statistics showed that suspects accounted for 40%, smokers and gamblers accounted for 20%, and the rest were mostly idle soldiers and discharged wounded soldiers, who were sent to the Military Police Inspectorate for interrogation. Director Chen plans to have ordinary criminals checked by various districts for bail, while military criminals will be submitted to the garrison headquarters for handling. The precautions for this inspection are: 1. weapons, 2. reactionary publications, 3. poisons, 4. idle personnel, and 5. prostitutes, gamblers, thieves, and bandits. The township heads and village chiefs will also guide the inspection to ensure familiarity and thoroughness. (February 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Eight Counties in Guangdong Province Implement the New County System <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department Formulates Matters for the Implementation of the New System</p>
<p>The Finance Department Stipulates the Local Autonomy Expenses</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In order to implement local autonomy, the Guangdong Civil Affairs Department plans to designate eight major counties to start a pilot program from March 1st. Preparations for the implementation of the new county system have been drafted in recent days. Once the provincial affairs meeting makes a resolution, it can be implemented.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>It is found that the eight counties for the new county system pilot program are Nanhai, Chaoan, Shunde, Taishan, Huiyang, Gaoyao, Qiongshan, and Qujiang. After the new county system is implemented, according to the new organizational law, the original police districts will be changed to public security sub-bureaus or sub-stations, which will be under the jurisdiction of the county public security bureau. The county public security bureau chief will be concurrently held by the county magistrate. After the county public security bureau is established, the entire county's guards or self-defense forces will be directed and supervised by the public security bureau. Therefore, the power of the county magistrate under the new system is greater than the power of the old county magistrate. As for the county autonomy expenses, the Finance Department also planned yesterday to designate funds so that autonomy matters can be fully implemented. According to the opinion of the Finance Department, the provincial treasury's income is not enough to cover expenses. If these autonomy expenses are allocated from the provincial treasury's taxes, other government expenses will inevitably be impossible to maintain. It is necessary to raise other funds. In February of this year, the department drafted a method for adding local taxes to counties before the land tax is changed, as well as regulations for the collection of township and town field and land donations, which were also approved for trial implementation. The original method for adding taxes was changed from the 19th year of the Republic of China. All local taxes added by various departments were incorporated into the original Dingmi unified tax amount, and a single collection was made without setting up additional names. The tax rate for unified collection was also changed by converting the odd amounts into whole amounts. The total income was divided into ten parts, with two parts retained and allocated as county local autonomy expenses, and the remaining eight parts were submitted to the department. It was also stated in the proposed regulations for the township and town field and land donations that they were for raising funds for township and town autonomy and other public security, education, and agricultural improvement needs. Now that various counties are carrying out autonomy, they should be allocated separately within the two established methods. All counties have been strictly ordered to follow these regulations.

<h3 id="e77">Salt Surtax Still Collected in Northern Anhui <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Finance Department Appoints Zhao Chunpu as the New Director of the Collection Bureau</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial General Bureau for the Collection of Salt Surtax in Northern Anhui was established in Bengbu last month under orders, but it has not been implemented due to unanimous opposition from merchants and people. Although the Su County sub-bureau superficially collects a surtax of 1.5 yuan per dan of salt, the salt merchants use a registration method to temporarily record the accounts as a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, there is actually no money to collect. Since the Bengbu General Bureau has no money to collect and has spent more than 2,000 yuan of start-up funds received from the province in more than a month, the director, Duan Shizhang, recently claimed illness and submitted his resignation to the Finance Department, which was approved. The Finance Department then appointed Zhao Chunpu as the acting director. (Zhao is currently the deputy director of the Adjutant's Office of the Reserve Army Corps and concurrently the director of the Corps' Office in Bengbu.) After Duan left Bengbu, the various departments in the bureau have been handling the handover in recent days. It is heard that Zhao will soon come to Bengbu from the province to take over. The Anhui Provincial Government will not stop the salt surtax collection because of the Central Government's repeated orders to stop it. Therefore, the hope of the merchants and people of northern Anhui to abolish the salt surtax is not easy to realize for a while. (February 10th)</p>

<p>The Ningbo and Hangzhou Rice Industry Associations have successively petitioned the provincial government to exempt the food industry from the 1/1000 business tax in order to alleviate the people's livelihood and reduce the burden, but this has not been approved. Therefore, they have separately requested the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce to convey the commercial situation, sincerely requesting exemption. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already submitted a report based on the situation, and the standing committee has visited Director Wang of the Finance Department in person to explain in detail the impossibility of increasing taxes. It is heard that there is a proposal to change the tax to be collected according to the total amount of capital.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to various industry associations stating that it had received an order from the municipal government approving a letter from the Hangzhou County Executive Committee stating that the price of rice in Hangzhou City has been stable, and all commodity prices that have increased due to the impact of rice prices should be reduced accordingly in order to achieve balance. Please all industry stores comply with this order.</p>
<p>The Finance Department received a total of five telegrams from the Shaoxing Foil Industry Association, and one telegram each from foil merchants Ru Shibao and Wang Yuanchang, all regarding the matter of subscribing for the foil business tax. A reply was given yesterday, stating that since the Shaoxing Foil Industry Association is responsible for proving that the subscription for the special business tax on foil in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is thorough and open, it is completely different from the previous contract donation system. Moreover, the department will still appoint a director to set up a bureau to supervise the collection. In the future, strict supervision will be carried out to ensure that the subscribing merchants do not manipulate and confuse the situation. If the foil shop industry believes that the collection procedures are not in accordance with the regulations, they are allowed to report the facts to the bureau for verification.</p>
<p>The Provincial Women's Sericulture Training Institute is currently proposed to be cancelled by the Construction Department. After a resolution by the Political Committee, it is scheduled to be closed on the 15th. The original 140 female students in the institute will register for screening at the Women's Sericulture Training Department attached to the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Center to determine who will stay and who will leave. An order has been issued to the center to comply. (12th)</p>

<p>Dr. Tao Chishun Accidentally Kills a Patient: Zhang Shouying, the wife of Zhou Jingxiao, a resident of the county, suffered from liver and stomach problems. On the 23rd of last month, Zhou invited Dr. Tao Chishun, the director of Housheng Hospital, to his home to take her pulse. Dr. Tao prescribed a bottle of stomach medicine and told Zhou to purchase a bottle of "Ovarian Afu'er" medication. He arrived at Zhou's home at 7 PM the following evening to administer an intravenous injection. However, as soon as the needle was withdrawn, Zhang's face turned pale, she sweated profusely, cried out in pain, her eyes rolled upward, she foamed at the mouth, and her limbs trembled, rendering her speechless. Upon seeing this, Tao immediately instructed Zhou to summon Western doctors Qian Baohua and Xu Shilin to his home for emergency treatment. Dr. Xu Shilin drew urine for examination and determined that the needle had touched a toxic substance, causing it to enter the bloodstream, making recovery impossible. Subsequently, Cheng Zhongfu and others were invited for emergency treatment, but it was ineffective. Zhang died tragically at noon on the 26th. Zhou immediately telegraphed Zhang's family in Dongtai. Zhang’s brother, Zaiyang, and others received the telegram and suspected that Zhou had failed to provide proper medical treatment, leading to her death. Zhou, feeling helpless, visited Dr. Tao's residence and requested him to come to his home to certify the cause of death in order to dispel public doubt. Unexpectedly, Tao's father, Tingfang, actually filed a lawsuit against Zhou in the county court, accusing him of damaging his reputation and trespassing on his residence. The court has now scheduled a hearing for the 23rd of this month to question Zhou. Zhou has also engaged lawyers An Ruotai and Yang Shi to draft a counter-suit against Tao Chishun, accusing him of negligence and manslaughter. Zhou is a reporter for the Xin Wuxi Bao (New Wuxi News) and a member of the Journalists' Union. Yesterday, he reported the details of the incident to the Union, requesting assistance. After receiving the report, the Union convened an emergency meeting of its members. From the perspective of the journalistic community, it was determined that justice should be upheld and humanity maintained in the case of a quack doctor causing death. It was resolved to form a specialized committee to determine six measures, issue a declaration, arouse public opinion, and sanction quack doctors who cause death. Sun Dexian, Song Shuqin, Shi Qinglin, and eleven others were appointed as committee members to handle the case. An official letter was sent to the County Physicians' Association, requesting them to hold a meeting to study the case, provide a detailed explanation, and respond impartially. Separate letters were sent to the doctors who had previously treated the patient, requesting detailed explanations. In addition, a petition was submitted to the County Party Committee and the County Government, urging them to uphold justice and impose the appropriate punishment on the quack doctor Tao Chishun. Furthermore, a renowned Shanghai physician was invited as a consultant to study the case, and the legal advisor to the Union was consulted to study the legal aspects of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Lu Changxing's Illegal Profiteering: Lu Changxing's cigarette paper shop in Xiatang, Qingming Bridge, outside the South Gate, has been engaged in the business of mortgaging gold and silver jewelry for several years. Its business has been very good, attracting the attention of bandits. In the past two years, two robbery cases have occurred. Recently, someone filed a complaint with the county government, accusing the shop of corruption. The county magistrate ordered the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau to thoroughly investigate the matter. After investigation and verification by Director Wang Weixin of the Bureau, it was found that the shop's concurrent operation of gold and silver jewelry was aimed at seeking illicit profits, which was highly inappropriate. Yesterday, the county government ordered the Bureau to effectively crack down on the illegal business.</p>
<p>Public Inspection of Electricity Theft at the New World: Recently, the Qishuyan Power Plant, in order to strictly prevent users from stealing electricity, organized an inspection team and dispatched investigators to conduct inspections. Recently, suspicious points were found on the seal of the yellow paper seal outside the electricity meter of the New World Hotel. The box was cut off and sealed by the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau for resolution. Subsequently, Zhang Deqing and Xie Shaojing, the managers of the New World Hotel, negotiated with the Chamber of Commerce and the Qishuyan Power Plant and jointly agreed on the following two points: (1) Both parties shall each send representatives to conduct a public inspection at the County Chamber of Commerce to prove the authenticity of the number and signature image on the seal. The Chamber of Commerce representative shall serve as a notary, and the County Government representative shall serve as an observer. (2) Representatives from both parties shall take the sealed electricity meter to the Shanghai Municipal Government Public Utilities Bureau for verification to prove whether the meter is running fast or slow. On the afternoon of the previous day, a public inspection was conducted at the Chamber of Commerce. The attendees included Na Menglin from the County Government, Qian Sunqing and Na Tongyi from the County Chamber of Commerce, Li Boshen, Zhu Zhilun, Yang Huaigu, Li Jizeng, and Yang Da from the Qichang Factory, and Zhang Deqing and Xie Shaojing from the New World. The electricity meter sealed by the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau was also sent for inspection. After reviewing the meter, the attendees found no errors. The yellow paper seal and the small seal were repeatedly studied, and three suspicious points were identified: (1) The Arabic numerals used to arrange the numbers seemed to have different sizes, and the shape of the "0" was also different. (2) There seemed to be a doubt in the "Zeng" character in Li Jizeng's signature. (3) The hidden marks on the seal could not be identified. After the representatives of both parties discussed these three points for a long time, the box was reopened for inspection of the electricity meter. After a detailed inspection, no obvious flaws could be found. It was agreed to reseal the original box, sign by the representatives of both parties, and temporarily store it at the Chamber of Commerce pending resolution.</p>

<p>Arrest of Bandit Wu Quanyi in Yuncun: Sun Yao, the chief of the 8th branch of the Public Security Bureau in Yuncun, 8th District of Wu County, received a report from night watchman Yao Xiaoli that a bandit named Wu Quanyi was hiding in the countryside. He was a wanted criminal in the robbery cases at the homes of Yang Bingxian in Guanzhuang Village and Sun Bingxiang in Jiajia Village last year. He immediately dispatched police to arrest him. The district office also provided a written certification confirming his identity. He was immediately escorted to the Public Security Bureau in the city. After a preliminary interrogation, he was transferred to the county government on the 11th for trial.</p>
<p>Arrest of a Bandit in Changzhou for a Kidnapping Case in Shanghai: Ren Youmei, a resident of Dongzhou, 5th District of Wu County, was engaged in business in Shanghai and resided in Sanle Lane, Changping Road, in the British Concession. His five-year-old son, Shao Rong, was kidnapped by bandits on the afternoon of November 18th last year. Later, Gu Arong, a fellow villager living with him, contacted the bandits and redeemed the hostage for 2,000 yuan. It was later discovered that Gu Arong was the kidnapper in this case and had fled back to Changzhou and was hiding in his home. Ren Zhimei immediately returned to his old residence in Dongzhou and reported the matter to the 5th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, requesting them to apprehend Gu Arong. Under interrogation, Gu confessed that the case was committed by Ren Guibin, a man named Mingfu from Nanjing, and himself, and that the money was divided equally among them.

<p>Order to Prepare for the Establishment of the County Land Bureau: The county government, in response to instructions from the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments regarding the land survey and measurement case, was authorized to prepare for the establishment of the Fengxian County Land Bureau in advance. The bureau would be responsible for handling all necessary start-up and monthly administrative matters. All expenses would be raised by the county on a monthly basis until the land survey fee could be collected. However, the request to establish a preparatory land survey committee was not approved. It is now understood that the case has been submitted to the current County Administrative Council for discussion. It has been decided that the total number of acres of farmland in the county is 529,800. It is planned to levy a special donation of five cents per mu starting from the busy season of the 20th year for surveying, exchanging documents, and registering, with a three-year period. This is expected to raise 157,800 yuan. At the same time, the Education and Construction Bureaus will also establish survey training institutes to cultivate talent and promote simultaneous progress, so that the establishment of the County Land Bureau will have sufficient preparation. Therefore, County Magistrate Shen has submitted the discussed details to the higher authorities in writing yesterday.</p>

<p>The Truth About the Kidnapping Case at Maojia Bridge: Shen Tongshun Oil Mill at Maojia Bridge, about four li outside Shuibeimen, was robbed on the 27th of last month, and the shop owner Yao Shou and his partner Xue Guanxing were kidnapped. It is now rumored in the community that Yao's kidnapping involved fraud, as Yao and others could not afford to pay the ransom. Some say they are still in the bandits' den. To investigate the details, the reporter went to the countryside for an on-site investigation and met Yao Shou's nephew, Shen Shengsheng. According to him, his uncle (Yao Shou) and Guanxing were indeed kidnapped by bandits on the 27th of last month and escaped on the 31st. Yao recounted the incident, saying that when he was kidnapped by the bandits, he pleaded for his release, but to no avail. He was hidden in the bow of the boat, preventing him from seeing the daylight. There were a total of three bandit boats, and the boat hiding Yao was in the middle of the two boats, guarded by eight bandits. During the day, they often patrolled in the river near Guangsheng Bridge, and at night they anchored in a small river. This lasted for two days. On the night of the 30th, the boat anchored somewhere, and all eight bandits went ashore. The boatman, who had been rowing all day, was extremely tired and fell asleep as soon as he lay down, snoring loudly. His uncle (Yao) saw an opportunity and used a bamboo pole to pole the boat to the other shore. He and Xue Guanxing left the boat and ran, crossing villages and wading through water. They did not know how many places they had been. Because they were eager to escape danger, they traveled all night. When dawn was approaching, they realized they had reached Tangjia Bridge. They knocked on the door of a village house and told the owner what had happened. The owner was very sympathetic and allowed them to stay for the whole day, fearing that they would encounter bandits again if they traveled at night. That night, they returned to their hometown. Fortunately, they were unharmed. However, due to the severe shock, their health was not good, and they are still unable to see guests. As for the rumors outside that the incident was fraudulent, it was actually a misunderstanding.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Municipal Education Bureau Issues Order to Strengthen Military Education <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Instruction No. 178: Order to all high schools and above in this city (no separate document will be issued). Case: The Ministry of Education's Instruction No. 167 states, "Case: The revised military education plan for high schools and above stipulates that military education should be studied for two years, two hours per week each year. This Ministry has already issued orders for compliance. It is now found that since the implementation of military training in public and private secondary schools and above in various provinces and cities, many have complied with the orders, but many have also disregarded them. Some schools only teach military subjects for one hour per week, while others reduce the time for practical training and increase the number of years of study. Moreover, uniforms are often incomplete, and morale is lax. Such situations hinder the progress of military training education. It must be known that military education is of great importance. The principals of each school are responsible for guidance and should supervise the equipment and teaching time of military education at all times, and should follow the provisions of laws and regulations and handle it seriously, and there should be no more habits of procrastination and disagreement. Furthermore, student uniform regulations have long been promulgated. Students should wear uniforms during military training to show neatness and should not ask for leave on the pretext of hindering teaching progress. In addition to issuing separate orders, we hereby order the bureau to notify public and private high schools and above to be aware of this order," etc. Upon receiving this order, we have already issued orders regarding the Ministry's revised military education plan for high schools and above and student uniform regulations. Now, upon receiving the previous instructions, we hereby order all high schools and above in this city to comply with this order. This order, February of the 20th year of the Republic of China, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau.</p>

<p>A丨I have been married for ten years. Only now can my wife and I be considered a true couple. B丨That's strange. What do you mean?</p>
<p>A丨Only because for ten years, my wife has always complained that I am too fat, which makes me angry.</p>
<p>B丨You are too fat, aren't you?</p>
<p>A丨But she doesn't say I'm fat anymore, and I don't care if she complains or not. I absolutely don't get angry. So I say only now can we be considered a true couple.</p>

<p>By Fan·Niu·Weng·</p>
<p>Gu Erniang Carves Inkstones: During the early Qing Dynasty, in the Shunzhi reign, Gu Erniang of Wu (Suzhou) was skilled at carving stone inkstones, inheriting her family's craft. She carved with meticulous detail and possessed unique artistic insight. Ordinary stones in her hands could be transformed into works of art. She could even use her small bound feet to test the quality of the stone. Tu Yuyang, the Shàngshū (High Official) of Xincheng, visited Su (Suzhou) and called on Song Muzhong, the Zhōngchéng (Censor), admiring Erniang's reputation. He sent attendants to her home in Zhuanzhu Lane, Jin Chang Ting, requesting her to carve several inkstones. This event is recorded in Yuyang's "Poetry Talks," "Ancient Fuyu Pavilion Miscellany," and "Chibei Outskirts Talks," mentioned repeatedly. Her skill can thus be understood. Today, Gu's descendants still uphold the family business, carefully polishing and restoring the inkstones. However, the current granddaughter-in-law's bound feet are like lotus boats on the peak of Taiyi Mountain—not three inches, but ten feet long.</p>
<p>Jin Shengtan Becomes the Mountain God of Dengwei: Zhang Ruocai, whose courtesy name was Shouhe, was extraordinarily intelligent. He lived in Liujia Port, inside Changmen (Suzhou City Gate), with a modestly prosperous family. His home boasted a beautiful bamboo and wood pavilion. The plaque of Guanhua Hall was inscribed by Chen Meigong Jiru of Songjiang. After the Shunzhi Emperor entered the customs, Ruocai, along with Jin Renrui, initially sought to participate in the provincial examination, hoping to eat芹(celery, symbolizing success in examinations). Thus, Zhang Ruocai transformed into Jin Shengtan. In his daily life, he drank and feigned madness, looking down on everyone else. He would take Zhuangzi, Lisao, Records of the Grand Historian, Du Fu's poems, Shi Nai'an's Water Margin, and Wang Shifu's Romance of the Western Chamber, reading and critiquing them. He praised them as the "Six Books of Talented Scholars," implying that apart from these six books, there was nothing else worth reading. Such was his extravagance. In the eighteenth year of Shunzhi, Shengtan was forty-three. In July, the tragic edict arrived in Su (Suzhou). Officials, as per custom, went to the Taiyang Palace to wail and mourn. Shengtan had once offended the Provincial Governor Zhu Guozhi with his words. Zhu held a deep-seated grudge and, taking advantage of the "alarming edict," fabricated charges against fourteen students, including Bai Gui and Zhang Jin, imprisoning them and sentencing them to death. In October, the details were sealed and sent to the capital for review. They were escorted to the imperial ruins (the imperial ruins were located in front of the Yanzi Temple. Zhang Shicheng built palaces there when he occupied Wu (Suzhou). Inside was Qiyun Tower. Xu Da and Chang Yuchun destroyed Suzhou and burned Qiyun Tower, which was at this location, leaving scorched earth, hence the name "ruins.") for execution. As Shengtan was about to be executed, he laughed and said to the executioner, "Beheading is the most painful thing, and confiscation is the most tragic thing. I, Jin Shengtan, never thought I would obtain it unintentionally. It can also be called a unique event in history.” After his death, his wife and children were exiled to Ningguta (His son was named Chao Gong and had a collection of literary works). His friend Wang Zhuoshan, from the same county and village, used planchette writing to summon the spirit of Shengtan, who came and wrote four poems.</p>
<p>"The vast world, past and present, is like floating dust.</p>
<p>All who are born, egg-born, are like dreams.</p>
<p>Only Jin Sheng cannot sleep,</p>
<p>And composes poetry under ten thousand plum blossoms."</p>
<p>He also added a note: "I have received grace from the Heavenly Emperor and have been appointed as the Copper Pit God of Dengwei Mountain!" (Dengwei is also called Xuanmu. Scholars all make a living by planting plum trees. There are no other trees for thirty miles. When Song Muzhong Mantang, the Provincial Governor of Suzhou, was in Shangqiu, he inscribed the three characters "Fragrant Snow Sea" on a stele at the Situ Temple, which still exists today.)</p>

<p>By Lü·Bing·</p>
<p>In recent years, divorce cases have been emerging endlessly in countries around the world. This trend is prevalent in the United States and has spread to the European continent. The relationship between men and women, sometimes together and sometimes apart, is viewed as normal and is not subject to any restrictions. It is now reported that Romania has already established divorce laws to remedy the situation. After implementation, the trend of advocating divorce in society should be slightly curbed.</p>
<p>The latest marriage law was drafted by Minister of Justice Dr. Qiuning. Severe penalties are to be imposed for abandonment and breach of contract between men and women. For example, if a husband abandons his wife at home and lives away for a long time, or if a wife arbitrarily leaves her husband without living together, fines or imprisonment shall be imposed in accordance with the law. The term of imprisonment is approximately three months to one year. In addition, the law also stipulates heavy fines for issues related to extramarital affairs. If a man and woman have entered into a marriage contract, and one party suddenly requests termination for some reason, the return of gifts and tokens should go through legal procedures and not be privately exchanged between the two parties. The protection for men and women who have entered into a marriage contract is even more comprehensive. The engagement ring is as important as the wedding ring in law. Furthermore, if a woman is rejected, she must still have her former fiancé's name attached to her name until she finds a second lover and enters into a marriage contract before she can break free. In addition, the new law also includes provisions for the benefit of illegitimate children. Illegitimate children are registered with their biological father's surname. If they are abandoned and the father is found, all education and other expenses can be pursued and enforced by law.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Wu Xingfen's Witty Remarks on Painting <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>By Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In recent painting circles, there are many female painters, such as Wu Xingfen, Zhang Hongwei, Fan Yingchu, Gu Qingyao, and Wu Qingxia, among whom Xingfen is a giant. It is unfortunate to hear of her passing away. Her virtuous voice is not far away, and there are still those who can describe her in general terms. Xingfen once discussed painting with others, saying that the quality of painting does not lie in being rough or fine. There should be fine intentions in roughness, and there should be sketch intentions in fineness. That is the best. When painting grass, insects, birds, and animals, one should seek their interest and charm, not their exact likeness. Exact likeness is best achieved in animal specimens. Why bother seeking it in painting? Among paintings, flowers and plants are the easiest, and figures are the most difficult. Therefore, those who paint for guests mostly paint flowers and plants and rarely paint figures. However, among figures, Amitabha Buddha is also particularly easy to paint. A triangular Zongzi (glutinous rice dumpling) with a longan on top embodies the Buddha state. While speaking, she painted it, her wit being such. When asked about contemporary trends of including foreign flowers and exotic animals in paintings, she responded, "Ancient people painted based on sketching from life. What didn't exist in ancient times could not be painted by ancient people. What is commonly seen today can be painted by modern people." Those who heard this were amazed. Xingfen also said, "Painting is related to one's character. Those with high character will have paintings that are free and unrestrained. Those with low character will have paintings that are inferior and turbid. Therefore, it is better to discuss one's character than to discuss one's painting.” Xingfen had a female companion who asked Xingfen to paint a peach. Xingfen was lazy and did not paint it even after frequent requests. The companion felt it was difficult to urge her again. However, her desire to obtain it was very urgent. One day, someone gifted her a basket of Feicheng peaches. The Feicheng peach has red flesh and thin skin. When the skin is slightly broken, the juice flows out, and one can suck it clean, leaving only the skin and pit. It is a famous product of Shandong Province. Xingfen was delighted when she ate it and remembered the peach painting. She painted it immediately as a reward. Her inspired brushstrokes were extraordinary. The companion treasured it like a gem.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Vow of White Heads <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>By Zui·Chi·Sheng·</p>
<p>"We two are bound by a vow of white heads," these high-sounding words, full of happy colors, can often be seen in the newspaper announcements of couples getting engaged. "White heads" mean "growing old together." It is truly right, proper, and auspicious from beginning to end. However, most people these days are impatient and often do not wait until their hair turns white. They break up and go their separate ways early. Looking at the divorce cases reported in the newspaper, there is no day without them. Some divorce after being engaged but before getting married. Some divorce the morning after getting married. Some have children and still request a divorce. Adults and gentlemen want to divorce. Even poor women from Jiangbei want to divorce. The tide of divorce is becoming more urgent. More and more people are becoming vegetarians. (Divorce and leaving the meat are homophones. If you leave the meat, you are naturally a vegetarian, just kidding). Where is the vow of white heads? It is difficult to wait for the day of white hair. If this European trend continues to spread eastward and people imitate each other, I am afraid that in the future, only a few couples will be able to stay together for life and keep the "vow of white heads." Therefore, in my opinion, it is better to cancel the words "white heads" in the future, rather than having them be famous but not real. Otherwise, it would be safer to replace the word "white" with the word "black." Or it would be wonderful to change "white heads" to "Yuan heads," because "Yuan heads" are a good thing and also the price of love. When the money runs out, they will look at each other with contempt, which may not be without it. This is called "mutually agreeing to a vow of Yuan heads." But whether it is appropriate or not, please discuss it with interested people. Haha.</p>
<p>Brief News: Recently, a group of students from the Minli Middle School, in order to seek legitimate entertainment and regulate their spirits after class, have organized a club. When naming it, they decided to pay attention to both string and bamboo instruments and Kunqu opera. The club is located at Chongqing Lane, Fangxie Road, outside the West Gate. Students are welcome to participate enthusiastically.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Travel Notes from Southeast Asia <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>(118) By Ling·Hua·</p>
<p>Although commerce is said to be sluggish now, the income of Chinese people overseas and their support for their motherland are still astonishing. It is said that last month, the overseas Chinese in Fujian remitted four million yuan to Xiamen, because the shield is expensive. In the past, one shield could be exchanged for one and a half yuan, but now eighty yuan can be exchanged for one hundred yuan. Moreover, the communist rebellion in Fujian Province is very fierce. Those who have relatives and friends in Southeast Asia are flocking to Southeast Asia. Overseas is no different from the Peach Garden of Qin Dynasty.</p>
<p>The Burmese have also begun to use agricultural machinery, buying it from England. There are those who are trying it in various villages. It is said that the price is four thousand yuan. Yangon is the central port, with rice mills for milling rice, as well as sawmills and glass factories, but no iron factories. People say that the British are unwilling to greatly enlighten the Burmese people's knowledge, fearing that if their intelligence is high, it will be difficult to subdue them.</p>
<p>There are bullock carts everywhere in Myanmar. Their driving method is different from that of China. They use one bull, placing a horizontal wooden yoke on the bull's neck. Two vertical wooden pieces are then connected to the cart box, forming a cross with the horizontal yoke. It is rare to see horses. There are no donkeys in the tropics. This driving method is done by the Indian Kalas. Is it Indian style? When I read poetry, it said that six reins were in hand, which meant that in ancient times, six horses were driven. It is impossible to see this in the Jianghuai region of China. I occasionally saw someone driving six horses in Zhili. However, in Marco Polo's travelogue, there was a photo of someone driving fourteen horses during the Yuan Dynasty, which is a rare sight. The Indians of India drive elephants, and the arctic people drive deer and dogs. Now European women drive airships. Progress, progress.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Yangon is very high, higher than in Singapore and Penang. Originally, the currency system was calculated in rupees, which was very unsuitable, because its cost of living exceeds the value of rupees by a wide margin. Therefore, one rupee is very inadequate. For example, in Singapore, one yuan can buy one hundred points of postage stamps, while here, one rupee can only buy sixteen points. The difference is huge. However, the price of rupees is still higher than the Chinese currency. The salaries of teachers in various primary schools here are still one hundred rupees, that is, one Mongolian institution can also receive eighty or ninety rupees per month (i.e., one shield), so it is not meager compared to the poverty and desolation of China. The rupee system is the currency of India. The cost of living in India is lower than in Southeast Asia, so it is applicable in India.</p>
<p>In September, there was a conflict between Christianity and Buddhism for ten days. Western missionaries were in great panic. The cause was that the principals of Yangon University wanted the Burmese students to believe in Christianity, and their language was improper, which caused great misunderstanding. Hundreds of Burmese students withdrew from school and issued a declaration. The students gathered and stayed at the Great Golden Pagoda. As a result, missionaries in various places were affected. In the end, the Westerners apologized in mediation, and classes resumed. The Burmese also have the appearance of making progress day by day. They do not back down when encountering things. However, Western power in the East, as observed from various Asian countries, also has a tendency to wane when the moon is full. The policy of gunboats and commerce does not work. Religion is also difficult to win. It is thought that a third new culture will rise to replace it, which is not a theory of mutual attack between East and West. The third new culture should be responsible for reconciliation, leading the world to peace.</p>

<p>Chapter 17: Maintaining Youthful Looks, Emerald Ink Blurs the Eyebrows; Continuing Life Has No Way, Gold Market for Horse Bones.</p>
<p>Hua Laoliu had no choice. These two big packages of clothes. Entering the Shikumen (stone gate) of that pawnshop, it was as if they were buried inside, and he didn't want to redeem them anymore. Being able to pawn them for an extra dollar felt like getting an extra dollar. The meaning was to exchange the dead clothes for living money. But the appraiser in the pawnshop had already seen this, desperately killing the poor ghost. These two boxes of clothes could not even be pawned for a hundred dollars in total. Hua Laoliu had to scrape together at least two hundred dollars before he could leave. He thought that these two big packages of clothes should be able to be pawned for two hundred dollars. Even if it wasn't enough, it should be at least one hundred and fifty dollars. If he added some other things, he could get by. Now, the shop assistant came back and said that the pawnshop said it was only pawned for seventy dollars. After saying it to them again and again, and promising them that he would redeem it, many of the clothes were newly made at the tailor's shop and had not been worn a few times. In total, they were pawned for eighty dollars. Then he had to think of another way. Although he had some jewelry, he had prepared to bring it to the north to wear. When he got to Beijing, he wouldn't have any finery at all. People would say that Hua Yuanchun Laoliu must have been embarrassed in Shanghai, so he came to Beijing. Otherwise, why wouldn't he have anything? At that time, he thought of something. A guest had once given him a platinum watch, surrounded by a circle of small diamonds and a few blue diamonds. Because at that time, watches were popular for a while. That guest was an overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia, who had really spent some money on Laoliu. At this time, he heard him say that he wanted to buy a watch, and he said, "The kind of watches that are popular in the market now, twenty or thirty dollars each, are all gold-plated. After a few months, they become slippery goods. If you want to buy one, you have to buy a good one." Hua Laoliu said, "Good ones cost a lot of money." The guest said, "I'll accompany you to buy it tomorrow. You can choose it yourself." The next day, the guest accompanied him to Uliwen. A foreigner saw that there were customers coming and quickly came to greet them himself. This guest led Hua Laoliu to a large glass cabinet and said, "Choose for yourself." Laoliu looked at it and said, "Are these all silver watches?" The guest said, "There are no silver watches in this cabinet. They are all platinum." Hua Yuanchun felt a little awkward when he heard this and quickly changed his words, saying, "Aren't the prices very expensive?" The guest said, "It doesn't matter. Whichever one you like, just ask him to take it out and look at it." Hua Yuanchun chose one with small diamonds around it and a slightly rectangular shape. The guest said, "This one is very good. Try wearing it." That foreigner with a face full of beards came to help Hua Laoliu. He held Hua Laoliu's slender wrist with his hands, which were covered in yellow hair, and fastened the buckle for him. Hua Laoliu just smiled at the guest, not daring to move at all.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Floating State of the Financial Gold Market <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Morning Decline, Afternoon Rise: Yesterday, February 12th, the gold market showed weakness in the morning but strengthened in the afternoon, with a strong rebound. The market situation was inevitably repeated. The trading volume was quite large, with sudden fluctuations of four or five taels. From morning to dusk, a total of twenty-two or three taels were traded. The psychology of the industry was uncertain. There was not much trading in the market. Because the rollover date was approaching, and within the closing period, Zhiyongxunheng and other companies sold in the morning, while Hengxingchang, Shengyongshunli, Yuanxingyong, etc. all bought. The foreign exchange market recovered after declining, and the listing price increased and then decreased, but the overall increase was still half a point. As for the soaring overseas silver market, the price of gold initially plummeted by more than ten taels, suddenly breaking the 740-tael mark. Afterwards, it was common to see伏(hidden) and complex fluctuations. However, because the exchange rate suddenly turned strong, and the bank's appetite was not thin, large households such as Changshengyong and Hengxing took advantage of the drag to enter, and the market situation quickly turned to a high point, thriving and advancing, soaring by more than ten taels. At noon, it even exceeded fifty taels. Later, Hengxing and other companies continued to enter, while Taixing and Zhifengyong exited. Speculators sold and then bought again, and the exchange rate improved, causing the price of gold to continue to rise, but with slight advances and retreats.

<p>Sharp Drops and Rises: The three-month opening price in the morning was 740 taels and a half, a drop of 8 taels and 5 qian. This was affected by the sharp rise of large bars by 16/7 of a cent and the increase in silver price by 3/4 of a cent. Because the European market was firm, and the United States continued to purchase, the private telegrams also increased by 3/4 of a cent. Then, Zhifenghengyongxin and others sold, and with the British gold being very generous, Sumitomo and others bought a total of 1275, so it dropped by 6 taels again, suddenly becoming 36 taels and a half around 9:10. However, it was 22 taels up and down at 1.

Changshengyongyuanxingyongheng and others successively competed to buy on the table, so the price stepped onto Qingyun, exceeding 50 taels, and amounting to 50 taels and 5 qian at 11:30. After a while, it lost more than one tael, and Taikangrun Dalianbang Hengxingchang and others again dragged in, and the British gold suddenly changed to shrinking to 1115, the US dollar to 25, and the Japanese gold to increasing by 1.5 qian, so the price increased by a total of 4 taels. At noon, it amounted to 52 taels and 8 qian, and the closing price added 2 taels and another 1 qian, amounting to more than 54 taels. The market situation was tight.

The buyers saw strength. At 3:30, it was 57 taels. After a quarter of an hour, it retreated to 54 taels. Hengxingshengda and retail investors made up for it. It was heard that the Indian exchange rate reported a small 1 or 2 anna. At 4:00, it was again 56 taels and a half, but the market situation was unstable. Afterwards, it was suppressed to 53 taels.

<h3 id="e118">Yarn, Raw Cotton and Yarn Market Exhibit Firm Attitude <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is firm because, although the exchange rate is relaxed, the price of raw cotton on the overseas market has risen, and the local price is still high in comparison. Therefore, the bulls are still in high spirits, without any intention of relaxing. A part of the pulling force is very tight. Currently, the opposing force is very weak, so the upward trend is fierce at the slightest opportunity. Most people are looking at higher prices, reaching an extreme. However, the market price is too high, which hinders actual sales. Most prudent people are taking a wait-and-see attitude and will decide on their strategies after observing the actual sales situation next spring. The Renbiao cotton market exhibits a tight trend. With the rise of American and Indian cotton, the market atmosphere on the following day was tight and spirited, and the trend remained strong. Prices for all months rose by one or two taels. There was some profit-taking by the bulls in the February-March settlement, causing a slight drop. As a result, the near months rose by one tael and two qian, seven li, and the distant months rose by four qian and six fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was still high, with strong pulling power from the bulls. Prices for each month rose by one tael. The February-March settlement fell again. Near months rose by one tael and two qian and four fen, and distant months rose by two qian and three fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,400 bales. It was found that Taishengkang sold 2,500 bales, Dachangcheng 2,650 bales, Yuda 750 bales, and Xincheng 2,100 bales.

<p>The cotton market is still firm, but although the exchange rate is relaxed, the market price has risen. The comparison between the two sides is still flat, so the bulls' attitude is very stable and they are unwilling to relax at all. They drag in whenever there is a drop. Currently, the sellers are shrinking and dare not move. Therefore, once there is an opportunity, the upward force will break through the front. In reality, foreign cotton is still worth the trouble. Therefore, the upward trend is chaotic and uneven. Buyers' minds are thick and unbearable. Most prudent people are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The future changes in the cotton market are difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The Hanbiao Market Had Active Buying. When the Hanbiao market opened in the morning, with the rise in foreign cotton, the popularity was firm, and prices for all months rose by 6-7 qian. The February-March settlement was slightly tired. As a result, the near months rose by 3, 4, and 6 qian, and the distant months rose by 1 and 2 qian. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was firm again, rising by 1, 3, and 4 qian. The transaction volume totaled 61,800 dan. It was found that Ruidai sold 14,300 dan, Hengde 2,500 dan, Rongxing 3,700 dan, and Gongtai 1,400 dan. Chang bought 7,500 dan, Tianlong 4,700 dan, Shenji 2,400 dan, and Changfeng 6,200 dan.

<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the number of ships arriving from various routes was still scarce, and sales were uneven. The market situation for white japonica rice was stable, and there were not many high-quality goods. Buyers were taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the overall situation was exceptionally calm. Special grades were priced at around 13.5 yuan. Sales of goat indica rice were dull and turned flat. However, top-grade goods were still good due to dryness. Sales of Dujian were active in retail, and the arrival of goods was not much. The market situation was in a stable state. The situation of thin rice arriving and selling was both unfavorable, and the promotion to kill the second element went uninspired. The selling atmosphere was strong, and the settlement was approaching in a blink of an eye. The owners of the goods were very willing to sell, and the market price was tired. The hidden yuan was sluggish and soulless.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai: Yesterday, the source of goods from the mainland was scarce, and the local sales were light. The arrival and sales of Changshu mechanized japonica rice were sluggish, but high-quality goods were still active, and the prices were high and firm, while the second-grade goods were flat. Sales of Suzhou and Tongbei japonica rice turned dull, and the market situation stabilized. Sales of southern early thin rice were still dull. There were slight inquiries from customers, and the market was the same as the previous day. Sheep Dujian and passenger indica rice stores picked up high-quality goods, while the middle and second-grade goods were slightly tired. Buyers of white yuan hanging blanks were taking a wait-and-see attitude and did not move, while the arrival of goods was continuous. Therefore, the overall market was cut by a corner.</p>

<p>1,400 Pieces Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>Quanzhou spring rolls, due to the small stock in the local area and the daily decrease in sources, it was found that a total of more than 1,400 pieces arrived on the Dayuanan wheel yesterday. According to the opinions of various cargo owners, all limited prices were increased by 45 taels based on the increased cost. At this time of the big settlement period, it is difficult to form a market. Therefore, various companies plan to temporarily store them and wait for the expiration date to open and exchange them again. From the perspective of the market situation, the future is promising.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the Shanghai Foreign Bank Silk Market, the Shanghai factory suddenly reported a surge in prices, due to the step of foreign exchange, European and American silk merchants began to take advantage of the cheap hoarding of Shanghai white factory prices, and various manufacturers still have difficulties in sales due to insufficient silk.

<p>Recently, silk weaving factories in Hangzhou have actively processed and woven spring silk because of the increasing number of orders. The demand for rayon raw materials is heavy.

<p>Zhenmei is an important commodity in green tea. Currently, there are still more than 21,000 boxes of inventory. Recently, although there have been sporadic sales from British and French companies, the actual supply still exceeds demand. Yesterday, the Russian Assistance Association Foreign Company invited various tea warehouses to conduct negotiations on Zhenmei in the upper and middle grades and began brewing tests. However, Russians have always held the principle of not buying unless it is cheap. During this period, the price of tea may not be expected to be high.</p>

<p>Cotton cloth in this factory: Since the implementation of the factory tax, the market price has risen step by step and is unusually chaotic, with no formal market price yet. The reason is that the permits have not yet been canceled. If it is to be shipped to other ports, both customs permits and factory tax are required, and customers are also reluctant to accept it. Therefore, except for collapsed goods transactions, not much is shipped out. However, people's hearts are very excited. Yesterday, it was said that colored ball fine cloth was sold to Tianjin for 7 taels 3 qian and 5 fen. After Yanghe fine twill was sold for 10 taels 3 qian per small package on this street, there is now a shortage of spot goods. Coarse cloth is rising very quickly. 9-pound Jubao Basin is 4 taels 3 qian 5 fen, Mao 4 taels 4 qian, 11-pound Three Deer Three Rabbits 4 taels 9 qian 5 fen, Ren Zhong 4 taels 8 qian 5 fen, 13-pound Double Double Horse are both 6 taels 1 qian, 16-pound Five Cranes 7 taels 6 qian 5 fen. The above prices do not include the factory tax.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods: The market situation is exceptionally deserted due to the approach of the general settlement period, but the asking prices are still high. Yesterday, grey light twill from eastern goods was unexpectedly sold to Tianjin for 5 taels 5 qian 5 fen. Yoshitada has already opened at 6 taels. The speed of the rise is really shocking. Direct tribute flannel, direct tribute satin, and patterned direct tribute flannel are not priced by those who hold the goods. They must be sold after the end of the settlement period. This street has been completely at a standstill. The Yangtze River basin has also been immobile recently. No goods are shipped to Sichuan during the settlement period. Only Tianjin still has good intentions. No matter what the goods are, if the price is cheap, they are all willing to buy them. Yesterday, yuan foreign yarn was also purchased, with Tang Taizong at 11 taels and Dian Qiuxiang at 11 taels and 5 qian.</p>

<p>As the general settlement period approaches, various industries in this port must settle their accounts, as do other ports. Therefore, the customer transactions in the coal industry market have mostly stopped loading goods in recent days, and the business of peers in this port is also extremely deserted.

<p>Talking About Abolishing Consular Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Strive to Achieve the Ultimate Goal</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at about 5:00 PM yesterday and immediately returned to his residence to rest. At 8:00 PM last night, he hosted a banquet for the Chinese and foreign press circles at the Dahua Hotel. More than 30 foreign reporters and more than 10 Chinese reporters attended. Wang was not fully recovered from his illness and did not arrive until 9:30 PM. He was received by Diao Minqian, Director of the Intelligence Department. During the banquet, Wang rose to give a speech, roughly saying that everyone still remembered that on December 28, 1929, the National Government had announced an order to abolish consular jurisdiction from January 1, 1930. At the same time, he also issued a declaration two days later to explain the National Government's order. The motive for the National Government to issue this order was, on the one hand, to reduce the causes of misunderstandings from all parties, and on the other hand, to promote the friendship between the Chinese and foreign people. The Chinese government, based on the goodwill expressed by various countries towards us in the past, firmly believed that various countries would have no objection to this principle. At the same time, the Chinese side was willing to deliberate with various countries within a considerable period of time on the measures that the government was preparing to take if any opinions were put forward. However, now that this deadline has passed, it has been twelve months, and no concrete solution has been found for the abolition of consular jurisdiction. This is something that has to be considered regrettable. According to the system of consular jurisdiction in China, it is a relic of the old era, not only is it not applicable to the modern era, but its current reality is a great obstacle to the free development of China's judicial and administrative system. The Chinese government has repeatedly explained all the ills of this system and has been repeatedly mentioned by legal experts and public opinion circles of various countries in public documents and academic discussions. Thirty years ago, several countries declared, "Once the legal situation in China and its trial methods are all proper, they will agree to give up consular jurisdiction." China has made undeniable significant progress in improving the judicial system in recent days. The National Government is really going all out to achieve it as soon as possible. The most important civil and criminal law, civil and criminal procedure law, land law, commercial law, etc., have all been modernized. Courts and prisons have also been set up throughout the country. In order to adapt to the needs of the whole country, many courts and prisons have been added in important locations. This is clear evidence of the improvement of China's judicial system. As for whether China's judicial system and judicial administration have reached the ideal standard in the minds of various countries, this is entirely a subjective view. Various countries can discuss it from their different perspectives and come to different conclusions. Therefore, this matter should be discussed fairly from the standpoint of both parties, and one side should not be biased, ignoring the other side's standpoint, just as the plaintiff should not be the judge at the same time. The investigation report of the Legal Rights Investigation Committee dispatched by the Washington Conference last time was completely one-sided observation, just like a prosecutor filing a lawsuit against a case and at the same time making a judgment on his own. Whether the judgment is fair is not known. Although this is different from the committee's report, the principle is the same. From another point of view, implementing the abolition of consular jurisdiction at this time cannot be said to be a drastic measure. There are a total of 25 countries that have treaty relations with China, of which 10 countries have no consular jurisdiction in China, 6 countries will give up in certain circumstances, and 3 countries have expired their treaties. Only 6 countries have not expired their old treaties. In other words, more than half of the treaty countries with China have their overseas Chinese citizens subject to Chinese law, and a quarter have expressed their willingness to place their overseas Chinese citizens under the protection of Chinese law. Therefore, today's abolition of consular jurisdiction only affects the people of six countries. It is especially important to note that in modern times, only China is bound by the relic of the old era, namely consular jurisdiction. Other countries that were in the same position as China in the past have long restored their judicial sovereignty. In this environment, the Chinese government and people will not vow to fight to the death to seek the early abolition of consular jurisdiction, and there is no way to face the country or themselves. The articles previously drafted by various countries, "Once the legal situation in China and its trial methods are all proper, they will agree to give up consular jurisdiction," seem to be specially designed by various countries to extend consular jurisdiction, not to abolish it. I deeply hope that the negotiations currently underway can determine the date of the official abolition of consular jurisdiction in the near future. Now the Chinese government and people have decided to make the greatest efforts to achieve this abolition goal. If the delay continues to be unresolved, it will not only be of no help, but will increase China's determination to abolish it. Therefore, I firmly believe that China will not be forced to adopt methods other than friendly negotiations to achieve this goal. Mr. Davis, a Shanghai-based reporter for the London Times, delivered a response on behalf of the guests, saying that he and his colleagues expressed great sympathy for Minister Wang's speech. China used to adhere to the closed-door policy and did not care about international affairs, but in recent years, it has made rapid progress and worked hard to govern. All facilities will be able to keep pace with the great powers. We very much hope that China's various construction plans can be realized one by one. Foreigners have great interests in China, and the abolition of consular jurisdiction must be carefully considered. The minister's political body is sick, and he came despite the snow. I and my colleagues are deeply grateful for the grand event and wish the minister a speedy recovery.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Diplomatic Discussion Committee Submits Document to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding Tap Water Issue <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The members of the Diplomatic Discussion Committee held their 34th regular meeting at the Bank Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road yesterday afternoon at 6:30 PM to discuss the draft proposal to the Ministry regarding the tap water issue in the Public Concession, and important cases regarding the situation of overseas Chinese in Singapore. The following is the original text of the submission to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the aftermath of the tap water issue, which has been passed: Submitted as a suggestion regarding opinions on the handling of the Shanghai Public Concession tap water issue. The committee held its 33rd regular meeting on January 9th of this year, regarding the proposal by the Director of the Office, Chen Shiguang, on the aftermath of the Shanghai Public Concession tap water price increase issue, and resolved to appoint committee members Lin Kanghou and Chu Huiseng, along with five expert committee members, Dong Xiujia, Xia Jinlin, He Dekui, Tao Leqin, and Zhang Xinglian, to conduct a detailed study. Now, according to the report, after being appointed, they immediately reviewed all the files related to the case from the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Shanghai Real Estate Association, and examined the accounting reports of the water company, as well as the contract signed by the Public Works Department and the British Shanghai Waterworks Company on March 17th of the 17th year of the Republic of China. After repeated joint and detailed research, it was unanimously agreed that tap water is an indispensable necessity for every resident in the concession, and its importance as a public utility is far greater than other public services such as electricity, telephone, and trams, which may have alternatives or may not be used. Moreover, since the filling of rivers and streams in the concession, residents cannot maintain their lives without using tap water. In addition, it has a close relationship with hygiene and fire prevention. Therefore, according to principles and common practice, this kind of public utility tap water can hardly achieve satisfactory results unless it is publicly operated. Now that the tap water in the Public Concession is exclusively operated by the British Shanghai Waterworks Company, and the Public Works Department has approved and signed a 20-year contract, we can only base our arguments on the established facts and seek remedial measures. The only reason for the water company's price increase this time is that the company's capital is calculated in British gold. Due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver, the Shanghai gold exchange rate has shrunk from two shillings and six pence, as stipulated in the contract, equivalent to one tael of Shanghai silver, to one shilling and six pence. As a result, the company's silver income is insufficient to distribute dividends of 9% for Class A shares, 7% for Class B shares, and 8% for Class C shares. As a result of discussions between the Public Works Department and the water company, it was approved that from September 1st of last year to December 31st of this year, regardless of whether the water price is calculated according to rent or according to water meters, all prices will be increased by 25% of the original price, that is, those calculated according to rent will be increased from 6% to 7.5%, and those calculated according to water meters will be increased from 50 cents to 62.5 cents per thousand gallons at the highest price. The reasons for the Chinese Ratepayers Association and other organizations' opposition to the price increase are: (1) The company did not reduce prices when silver was expensive and gold was cheap, so why should the company increase prices when gold is expensive and silver is cheap? (2) According to the provisions of the contract, the water price must be revised every five years, or every two years as agreed by the Public Works Department and the water company, which will expire on June 30th of this year. If the water price is to be changed, the water company must apply to the Public Works Department five months before this date. The water company did not follow this regulation when changing the water price this time, and the Public Works Department approved the price increase without delay, which is considered to be a disregard for the interests of the residents. While the dispute was ongoing, the water company used the Public Works Department's approval of the price increase as a guarantee, and openly cut off the water supply to coerce the price increase. Fortunately, after the Chinese directors strongly argued, the price increase was temporarily suspended, and the Public Works Department hired an expert to join the Public Utilities Committee to investigate all the circumstances of the water company in detail and study whether the water price could be reduced, with the aim of completing the task before September 30th of this year, so that no major accidents occurred. However, the price increase issue has temporarily come to an end, and future remedies must be planned as soon as possible. The capital of the water company is assumed to be in silver units, and its income tends to increase year by year, so the price increase would not have occurred. Moreover, the interest rate guarantee for the water company's capital is too high based on the situation in the concession and the solidity of the business. Furthermore, the water company twice issued bonus shares of 195,080 pounds in public reserve funds in the 10th and 15th years of the Republic of China, which is tantamount to making the water company's assets debts. Moreover, in the 15th year of the Republic of China, the water company unconditionally gave the assets of the tap water equipment department, valued at 200,180 taels of silver, to shareholders for independent operation. Therefore, although the main reason for the company's price increase is the high price of gold and the low price of silver, it is actually related to excessively high interest rate guarantees and the distribution of bonus shares. As a remedy, it is recommended that the authorities negotiate and order the Public Works Department to promptly revise the aforementioned contract with the water company. The main points of the revision are: (1) The water company's capital should be converted into silver units, and the calculation rate should be based on the average of the Shanghai-British exchange rate from the 9th to the 19th year of the Republic of China. (2) The original dividend rate should be limited to 6% per annum, and no bonus shares should be distributed. (3) Bonus shares may be distributed when the company has a surplus after deducting all expenses such as the original dividend rate, but the annual rate should not exceed 6% at most. If there is no dividend to be paid or the dividend paid is insufficient in the current year, no supplementary payment or compensation should be made in any subsequent year. (4) The profits from water supply outside the concession and to ships should not be separately proposed, but should be included in the total income. (5) In the future, the water price, regardless of whether it is calculated according to rent or water meter, should not exceed an average of 30 cents of silver per thousand gallons. (6) The property of the tap water equipment company should be unconditionally recovered by the water company. (7) The water company should set up more public taps for the poor to draw water. (8) The effective period of the revised contract should not exceed December 31st of the 35th year of the Republic of China at most (according to the effective period of the current contract, it will expire on December 31st of the 35th year of the Republic of China). After the expiration, the term should not be extended. Upon expiration, the Public Works Department or its successor should recover the shares of the water company at face value. Otherwise, the contract must be renegotiated. The matter concerns public utility and should be argued according to reason. The 34th regular meeting on February 12th resolved to pass the resolution and submit a document accordingly for review. We respectfully request that you grant us a negotiation, which is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with a copy of the contract attached, and a report on the review of the water company's accounts. Another letter to the Chinese directors states: Regarding the aftermath of the public concession tap water price increase issue, after discussion by our committee, it was resolved to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Chinese directors. In addition to submitting it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we hereby enclose a copy of the original submission and a letter requesting you to investigate and strive for it. This is a testament to our profound friendship. Respectfully addressed to the members of the board of directors.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Business Tax Rules Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Approves Zhejiang Labor Tax, Pending Revision</p>
<p>Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce Requesting Representatives to Strive for Four Points</p>
<p>The city's various trade associations previously sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance to correct the business tax issue in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, agreeing to revise the regulations separately. The association sent a letter to each representative, requesting them to strive for four points because the City Chamber of Commerce had appointed representatives to attend the discussion on business tax with the city's Finance Bureau, a matter of great importance to all industries. The contents of the letter are recorded separately as follows: "Ministry of Finance Reply" Received. The draft business tax regulations for Zhejiang Province have been approved and submitted to the Ministry by the Provincial Government. The Ministry is in the process of reviewing each item, including the business classification, tax base, and tax rate. If there are any provisions that exceed the Ministry's established guidelines and supplementary measures, they should be revised separately before replying to the Provincial Government and instructing the Finance Department to comply. Please be informed accordingly.</p>
<p>Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce Representatives Attending the Business Tax Discussion: Dear Gentlemen Yan Song, Qinghua, Wenqi, Jiaobo, and Songyuan, I am pleased to read in the newspaper that you have been elected by the City Chamber of Commerce to attend the discussion on the city's business tax rules. With your great talent and profound knowledge, I am deeply delighted to have you. The business tax rules are deeply and significantly related to the future interests of merchants. I believe that you have a far-sighted vision and must have a clear plan in mind, so I need not repeat myself. However, as the association has specific responsibilities, I dare to say a few words at the beginning of your appointment as a token of our support. (1) Business tax is a fundamental solution decided by the tariff reduction conference to compensate for the local tariff reduction losses. Therefore, the exact amount of tariff reduction losses in the city should first be clearly announced by the Finance Bureau to make citizens aware of it and serve as a strong basis. At the time of drafting, the tax rate should also have a certain standard. This is a consistent demand of all industries and should be strongly advocated. (2) The harm and disturbance of tariffs on merchants and people have long been criticized by the world. At this time of tax system innovation, we should strive for perfection to avoid repeating the same mistakes. For example, the tax rates set by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments are inconsistent and are all based on goods as units, which opens the door to harassment. Our association has already detailed this in a letter sent to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government through the City Chamber of Commerce on February 7th. I believe you have already seen it in the newspapers. Therefore, when discussing the city's business tax, unless the government has other regulations below 2 per mille, the tax rate should not exceed 2 per mille. The wholesale portion should still be taxed at one-quarter. As for the collection method, it should follow the proportion method based on the business tax amount proposed by Anhui Province to avoid harassment and eliminate abuses. This should be strongly advocated. (3) There is a gap between the Chinese and foreign concessions in the city. The Chinese business community is inferior to the concessions. Although the reasons are not one-sided, the failure to implement all laws and tax rules equally is also a major cause. If the current business tax cannot be applied to stores in the concessions in the future, it will only drive away the sparrows and further nourish the prosperity of the concessions, making it even more difficult for the Chinese business community to recover. This should be strongly advocated. (4) In addition to the gap between the concessions, there are also foreign-funded commercial firms in the city. These firms often use consuls as protectors and regard our country's laws as worthless. For example, in terms of stamp tax, stores in the concessions have already affixed stamps, and there are many cases of punishment for tax evasion. However, these foreign-funded stores are uniquely spared. If the business tax rate in the future also fails to make foreign-funded stores bear equal obligations, then the cost of firms operating the same goods will invisibly increase if they are established with Chinese capital, hindering their sales. The resulting abuses will only help the economic aggression of others, making it even more impossible for Chinese businesses to gain a foothold. This should be strongly advocated. The above four points are all the most important aspects. Please take into account the special environment of the city and the difficulties of the business community, and resolutely speak for the merchants and people. Please do not be slow and complacent, and do not follow the tastes of others, lest you put the city's merchants in a situation from which they cannot recover. This is what our association sincerely prays for. I offer my sincere advice and hope for your clear understanding.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Lacework Industry Requests Exemption from Business Tax <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Will Send Representatives to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lacework and Embroidery Trade Association recently heard that the Zhejiang Province has set the business tax rate for the industry at 20 per mille, which is extremely alarming. Because the industry's products are all sold abroad and have never paid any taxes, the amount levied is actually unbearable. A special executive committee meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on the 14th (Saturday) to discuss everything, and it is planned to send representatives to Beijing to petition for exemption from business tax in order to protect the vitality of foreign trade.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Lin Kanghou's Discussion of Business Tax <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and Co-Chairman of the Banking Branch, told a reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday that the business tax levied by various provinces after the tariff reduction is based on the nine guidelines formulated in the official-civilian tariff reduction conference in August of the 17th year of the Republic of China. The guidelines promulgated by the Ministry today are derived from them. There are three methods for collecting business tax: (1) according to the total amount of capital; (2) according to the total turnover; (3) according to the net profit. Each province sets its own detailed rules according to these guidelines, so they vary from province to province, which is quite noteworthy. The Spanish national treasury and people's wealth have been severely burdened by the bad business tax. The past is a lesson. I sincerely hope that the authorities in each province will be cautious about this matter. In the past, China also collected business taxes, such as the so-called "tooth posts" and licenses, but the amount collected was very small. Now, a tax of 2 per mille is not small. In the previous tariff reduction conference, the business community had already made many compromises. Now, the supplementary regulations to the guidelines promulgated by the Ministry are quite different from the principles agreed upon in the tariff reduction conference. However, the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are levying as much as 10 per mille. A tax of 10 per mille is an inappropriate term because it should be changed to 1 percent. The guidelines agreed upon in the tariff reduction conference have completely lost their effect. What is there to say about public opinion? Now, what the business community is arguing about and sincerely requesting is only that it does not violate the guidelines of the tariff reduction conference and does not place too heavy a burden on the people. This is the general concept of the business community. I am only expressing my personal views and not representing any organization.</p>

<p>Improving Detention Centers</p>
<p>Prohibiting Police Extortion</p>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Municipal Security Bureau, Chen Xizeng, stayed at the bureau after taking office yesterday and inspected the detention center of the Public Security Bureau yesterday, preparing to actively improve it. He also instructed the chiefs and staff of each section to give lectures to the detainees in rotation, to influence them and provide them with a path to self-renewal after their release from prison. Director Chen also stated that the law is to protect human rights, and the Public Security Bureau has the most direct relationship with the people. In the future, the main purpose will be to reduce the suffering of the people, and police officers will be strictly prohibited from extorting money under any pretext. He also plans to secretly inspect various districts. If any police officer is found to be extorting money, he will not be tolerated, and the public is welcome to report directly.</p>

<p>Expected to Return Around December</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, Major Cholerton, Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, will take a long vacation to return to his country. His duties will be performed by Deputy Chief Inspector Captain Martin. Cholerton is scheduled to leave Shanghai by ship on the 18th. He will stay in India for two weeks en route, then go to Germany to inspect police affairs, and then return to London to visit his family. He is expected to return to Shanghai around December. According to reports, Cholerton came to Shanghai in October 1929. He was loaned to the Public Works Department by the Indian government to reorganize the police force. He soon took office as Chief Inspector and began reorganizing. The board of directors of the Public Works Department is very satisfied with Cholerton's performance and has asked him to serve permanently. Cholerton himself is also willing to work in Shanghai, but a formal reply has not yet been received after consulting the Indian government.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Issue of Implementing Factory Law in the Concession <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Women's Organizations and Public Works Department in Discussion</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Gazette published a letter from the Shanghai Women's Organizations Joint Committee on the 24th of last month, stating that after presenting a research report on the newly promulgated Factory Law of the National Government at the committee meeting on the 21st of this month, the committee, which has always paid close attention to improving the working standards of women and children, passed a resolution by Chinese and foreign women, requesting the Public Works Department to consider whether the Factory Law could be implemented in the Public Concession and cooperate with the National Government to investigate the current situation of factories and find ways to promote it. It is believed that this matter has long been under consideration by your bureau, and we sincerely hope to see progress. At that time, the committee also passed a resolution, writing to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to express its delight at the well-drafted factory regulations and hope that they will be gradually implemented and seek cooperation with foreign authorities. Subsequently, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce replied to the association on the 30th of last month, stating that it was pleased to receive the letter and that the Shanghai Women's Organizations were attentive to the improvement of social welfare and the evolution of factory conditions, which was admirable. When the Child Labor Committee was organized in 1924, China lacked a central government and there were no properly established national laws and regulations, so the bureau was unable to implement its policy of adopting Western humanitarian principles for managing the work of women and children within the scope that could be implemented in the concession. Although the autonomous improvement of factory owners and the urging of public opinion have made many achievements in improving the working conditions of women and children in the local area, the Public Works Department welcomes it very much. The wishes of the Chinese government listed in the Factory Law are that it is willing to cooperate with the government and raise the labor situation in terms of legislation. The matters mentioned in the letter are already under the bureau's close attention. If it is possible to cooperate, it would be very gratifying.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union put forward a request for housing subsidies, a uniform 10 yuan for all, and has negotiated with the authorities several times, but has not received a response. It is now learned that at 11:00 AM yesterday, the union sent representatives Lu Jingshi, Zhang Kechang, Zhu Xuefan, and Qi Mou to meet with Qian Chunqi, Director General of Posts, for final negotiations. As a result, Director General Qian did not give a satisfactory answer to the demands of the union. After lengthy negotiations, a breakdown is imminent, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. It is reported that the union's attitude is very firm. If there is no adequate solution, it will take decisive action.</p>

<p>During the Business Community's Closing Period</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps Reorganization Committee, in view of the fact that February 14th, 15th, and 16th are the closing period for merchants, has temporarily stepped up precautions. After deciding on a plan, it was distributed to the various teams and inspection offices for reference. The plan is as follows: (1) On the 14th and 15th, each team will send out one platoon for defense. During the day, patrol teams will be organized and patrols will be conducted. From 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM, sentry posts will be deployed as appropriate in places where there is a shortage of police officers. (2) Each team should dispatch additional patrol teams as needed. (3) The time will be from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM. (4) On the 16th, each team must send out two platoons for defense. In addition to deploying sentry posts, additional patrol teams will be dispatched. (5) The time will be from 5:00 PM to 12:00 PM. (6) The patrol teams of each team will contact the team leaders to coordinate the time for meeting patrols at any time. (7) In addition to the assigned officers and inspectors stationed on duty, the corps headquarters will also send personnel to reside in the teams to inspect the diligence of each team and the situation of the defense. (8) In the event of an emergency, they will cooperate with the military and police, but must immediately report to the corps headquarters. (9) Each team must list the number of posts deployed and submit them to the corps headquarters for the purpose of sending personnel to patrol. (10) The corps headquarters will form a patrol team of officers to patrol the various teams.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Shanghai-Ningbo Steamers Implement Escort and Increase Freight Rates <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Agreed to Start on the 18th</p>
<p>Pirates are rampant on the Zhejiang sea. According to the steamers navigating the Zhejiang waters, the area around Qijiaoshan is where pirates often appear. Gunshots are often heard when steamers pass through this area. The Shanghai-Ningbo steamers have set up an escort team to prevent piracy, as reported earlier in this newspaper. The details of this case and the increase in fees are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Suspension of Service Issue: Shanghai-Ningbo steamers routinely suspend service at the end of the lunar year and the beginning of the new year. This year, the central government is vigorously promoting the Gregorian calendar. The China Merchants Sanbei Ningshao and other three companies have held many meetings and decided to comply with the order and cancel the old practice of suspending service at the beginning of the lunar year. They have specifically stated this to the crew and sailors of the New Jiangtian, New Ningshao, and Ningxing steamers, and they will operate as usual. However, the British Taikoo Company's New Beijing steamer still complied with the crew's request and suspended two voyages at the beginning of the new year, which has already been decided.</p>
<p>Request for Weapons for Escort Police: The three companies' escort teams originally planned to board the ships on the 18th at the same time and issue航警手槍木壳槍and bullets. It was originally hoped that they would be received before that day (i.e., within this week) so that they could be issued to each ship and handed over to the escort captains and police officers stationed on the ships. However, the letter was sent to the bureau, but no reply has been received as of yesterday, and the weapons have not been received. Therefore, it may be too late to send police officers on board the ships on the 18th. If they cannot be issued this week, it may be postponed for one or two voyages. The companies have already drafted a second letter to urge the receipt of the weapons.</p>
<p>Details of Fee Increase: Due to the increase in航警, the fare has been increased by 20% according to the established rate. All passengers have been notified and it will be implemented on the 18th. Now that the date of implementation is near, the reporter has conducted a detailed investigation of the new freight rates and recorded the main points for public viewing.</p>
<p>Commodity Name Weight New Price Original Price</p>
<p>Cotton yarn Per piece 1.20 1.00</p>
<p>Foreign cloth Large piece 1.20 1.00</p>

<p>Glass Per piece 0.26 0.22</p>
<p>Tobacco leaves Per dan 0.52 0.43</p>
<p>Paper waste Per piece 1.33 1.11</p>

<p>Cigarettes Per case 1.02 0.85</p>
<p>White rattan Per piece 0.20 0.17</p>
<p>Measurement cargo Per ton increased from 4 taels, 2 mace, and 5 candareens to 5 taels and 1 mace. The above are the prices of the most needed goods, which are the daily freight rates of Shanghai-Ningbo merchants. Other miscellaneous goods that are not frequently loaded are not recorded.</p>
<p>Merchants Request Reduction: Yesterday, the Ningbo Salted Fish Industry and the Flour Industry jointly sent a letter to the steamer companies, requesting exemption from the increase in freight rates. The reason is that the Shanghai-Ningbo steamers have annual profits, and the state-owned steamers should not aim to make profits. Moreover, wheat flour is a necessary food for the people, so it is not appropriate to increase freight rates, and reducing freight rates will indirectly benefit people's livelihood. The three companies have already solicited the opinions of each company on this letter and will make a decision after that.</p>

<p>Liji Goes to Tow New Ningxing: The New Ningxing is aground at Baihu Mountain, more than 100 miles from Hankou. The Sanbei Company first sent the Yi'an and Yang'an steamers to transfer cargo. Now, the Hankou branch has rented two tugboats from the Liji Company in Wuxue for a daily rental of 50 yuan to sail to Baihu Mountain to tow.</p>
<p>Changfu Maru Has Not Been Rescued: The Japanese Shichishita Company's Changfu Maru ran aground, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the ship's accident occurred at 113 degrees 29 minutes east longitude and 22 degrees 33 minutes north latitude. The entire ship has about 60,000 to 70,000 bags of wheat, which were transported from Australia to Shanghai and were ordered by local Chinese flour mills. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th or 28th. Now, Shichishita has ordered the Australian branch to rescue the ship and telegraphed to inquire about the safety of the crew and sailors. It is reported that the bottom of the ship is broken and the cargo hold has been flooded.</p>
<p>Four Rented Ships Continue to Be Released: The Transportation Department of the Headquarters telegraphed the Sanbei Company yesterday, stating that the military transport has been completed and the four ships Fulong, Fengpu, Xingshi, and Dexing, which were transferred from the bureau, have been released and ordered to return to Shanghai to resume service. Sanbei has already assigned the Xingshi ship and it will operate the Yangtze River route tomorrow.</p>
<p>Jiangda Steamer Towed Out of Danger: The Jiangda steamer, which was hit by the Taikoo oil barge, was sent by the bureau to Iron One to separate the bow of the ship. It was towed back to Nanjing by Tunan yesterday and can be opened to Shanghai today. Because the keel is broken, it must be sent to the factory for major repairs.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Mrs. Lai's Views on Opium Prohibition <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Opposing Opium Monopoly</p>
<p>Mrs. Lai, an American leader in drug prohibition and former director of the American delegation to the International Opium Conference, recently passed through Shanghai on her way to Fiji. It is said that during her stay in Shanghai, Mrs. Lai visited many Chinese and foreign friends and those enthusiastic about drug prohibition, discussing the issue of opium prohibition in the Far East. She paid particular attention to the current widespread talk of a foreign opium monopoly. Mrs. Lai expressed her views to Mr. Tang Shaoyi, Honorary Chairman, Mr. Wang Jingqi, Chairman, and Mr. Huang Jiahui, General Secretary, of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, stating that opium monopoly has been opposed by both the government and the public in China for the past ten years. The establishment of the Hague Convention in 1912 was particularly urged by those who cared about the interests of the Chinese people, and the provisions of the treaty clearly opposed the monopoly system, truly considering the interests of the Chinese people. It is incomprehensible to the world that those related to the Hague Convention are now advocating for a monopoly. Although the Hague Convention has not been fully implemented in various countries today, China is the country that benefits the most from it and should strive to promote its spirit and maintain its usefulness, and must not be the first to undermine it and abandon itself. All enemies of China's opium prohibition hope that China will implement an opium monopoly, so as to prevent the opium monopoly in colonies from becoming a target of attack by the Chinese. If important figures among the Chinese advocate for a monopoly, it would be tantamount to pleasing the enemy, making opium prohibition hopeless. Although the United States has not implemented a monopoly in Fiji, its results are better than those of other colonies that have implemented a monopoly, which shows that opium monopoly has nothing to recommend it except as a source of revenue. Mr. Tang Shaoyi, a pioneer of opium prohibition in your country, often said that advocating for the government to implement an opium monopoly is like tempting a tiger to taste human blood, which will inevitably lead to a situation where it cannot be stopped in the future. The precedent of likin [internal transit tax] can be seen. Although China is poor today, there are many ways to raise funds. Why take it from opium, like drinking poison to quench thirst? As for the Ministry of Finance hearing that it has sent people to investigate the Taiwan monopoly system, it is even more incomprehensible to outsiders. Taiwan's opium prohibition is nominally in place, but in reality, it is nothing more than a consideration for revenue. It is hoped that the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association will work hard to oppose it and prevent it from being realized. It is also hoped that the people of your country will clearly understand the pros and cons, know what to choose and what to abandon, and not cause endless trouble due to a momentary mistake.</p>

<p>The Special Party Branch of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Recently, the Workers' Union of the two railways forwarded a report from the Wusong Machine Factory Workers' Union, the Shanghai Machine Factory Workers' Union, and the Engineering and Electrical Departments, requesting the Railway Bureau to supplement and issue half a month's bonus for the 19th year in accordance with the previous regulations, in order to appease the workers. It is said that the Special Party Branch of the two railways, in view of the hard work of the employees throughout the year and the prosperous business, which has surpassed the past, and that there is no doubt that labor should be rewarded, and that the two railways had a surplus in the 19th year, proposed to allocate 20% of the surplus to issue bonuses to employees in accordance with the regulations, which is equivalent to one and a half months' salary for the employees, which has not exceeded the regulations. The employees continue to demand, and the situation is quite intense.

<h3 id="e153">Municipal Government to Inspect Cross-River Ferries Today <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Wharf Construction Nearing Completion</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities is actively preparing for the long-distance ferry's original routes and the addition of cross-river routes in order to facilitate transportation on the Huangpu River. It is now learned that the three cross-river ferries built by the He Xing Machinery Manufacturing Factory have been completed and have undergone trial runs. The average speed is 8.4 nautical miles per hour, and the results are satisfactory. The official inspection will be held this afternoon. It is also heard that Director Huang of the Bureau, together with Director Shen and Section Chief Xu of the Bureau of Public Works, visited the three wharves of Gaoqiao, Dinghai Bridge, and Qingning Temple, which are organized by the Bureau of Public Works, and the road and bridge construction connecting the Gaoqiao ferry terminal. They were satisfied with the smooth progress and soon completion. Therefore, the Bureau's original plan to extend the route to Gaoqiao and open cross-river ferries between Dinghai Bridge and Qingning Temple can be realized in a short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Record of the Board Meeting of the Chinese Leprosy Association <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association held a regular meeting at the Bankers' Association at 6:00 p.m. (on the 11th). The General Secretary, Wu Zhijian, reported that the association, in addition to donating clothing, books, daily necessities, etc., to leprosy hospitals across the country as Christmas gifts, currently has a sum of approximately 4,600 yuan. It also donated 2,000 yuan to the Beihai Leprosy Hospital in Guangdong Province to purchase land. The Yanping Leprosy Hospital in Fujian was destroyed by fire two years ago and is currently being rebuilt by Dr. Schneider. The association donated 1,000 yuan to assist. The deadline for the student essay competition on eradicating leprosy was originally the end of February, but students from remote provinces are now requesting the rules and regulations, so it seems necessary to extend the deadline. It was decided to extend the deadline by three months to the end of May. The new leprosy hospital in Nanchang may not be completed until the end of this month due to frequent influence from the bandits. The opening ceremony is now scheduled for March 14th. However, because the provincial government has been in arrears with the subsidies for the old leprosy hospital for five months, the patients who had been admitted have scattered in the streets, begging for a living. It is uncertain whether the provincial government will continue to provide subsidies as before when the new hospital is completed, so the Nanchang branch decided to reduce the number of patients admitted by half to 20. This matter has a negative impact on public health in the area. It was decided to submit a request to the Jiangxi Provincial Government to continue the monthly subsidy of 120 yuan, so that 40 patients can be admitted according to the original plan.</p>

<h3 id="e159">China's Innovation: Safe Night Deposit Box <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>New Facilities at the Shanghai Bank's Avenue Joffre Branch</p>
<p>The safe night deposit box, originally named Night Depository, is popular in European and American banks in recent years, but has not been seen in China before. This night deposit box is made of pure steel and its style is similar to a mailbox. It is usually installed at the entrance of the bank, so as to facilitate the convenience of merchants with night market income. Every time they cannot send the money to the bank on the same day, it is inevitable that accidents will occur in the store where it is stored. With this night deposit box, all deposits after the bank's business hours can be put into the night deposit box. The method of use is extremely convenient. After obtaining the bank's permission and paying a considerable deposit, the depositor can receive a numbered money bag, a key, and a key to the night deposit box. When depositing money, they only need to put the banknotes and checks into the money bag, and the mouth of the bag is closed with a lock. No one else has a key to open the bag except the depositor. When the money bag is put into the night deposit box, there is a door on the top of the box. All depositors have a key to open this door. When the door is opened, there is a steel plate attached to the entrance of the box. At the same time, the money bag is placed on the steel plate. When the door is closed, the steel plate also falls, and the money bag falls to the bottom of the box. The box is five feet eight inches high. The advantage is that when the door is opened, there is a steel plate that can cover the entrance of the box, so no one can see or touch the contents of the box. There is another door at the bottom of the night deposit box. The next morning, the bank supervisor will open this door, take out the money bag, and wait for the depositor to come to open the bag in person. According to the ordinary deposit method, it is entered into the depositor's account. The safe night deposit box is also a new business in European and American banks in the past two or three years. It was first created in England and has not been heard of in China before. Now, the Shanghai Bank, in line with the purpose of serving society and seeking convenience for depositors, has spared no expense and specially commissioned the local Lao Jinlong Foreign Firm to order this night deposit box from the famous Helung Hall Marvin Safe Co. in the United States last year. It has been shipped to Shanghai and is now hiring craftsmen to install it at the entrance of the bank's Avenue Joffre branch. It will be completed and used soon. The night deposit box is valued at 1,600 US dollars. According to the current exchange rate, it is equivalent to more than 7,800 Chinese yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Two Points That Creditors of the Riye Bank and Others Should Pay Attention To <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Talk</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that the reporter met Mr. Yu Qiaqing yesterday and he briefly expressed his views on the Riyue Bank. Regarding the aftermath of Mr. Huang Chu Jiu, the situation is still good after Mayor Zhang and other comrades of the municipal government have properly planned and demonstrated it. Several meetings have been held in the past few days, and all comrades are pre-setting up ways to find a way out for the creditors. However, what I (Yu said himself) hope most is two points: first, the creditors' organizations should be concentrated together to form a whole organization, and never be scattered, so that both parties can easily contact each other; second, I hope that the stocks and savings receipts held by the creditors will not be transferred. It is heard that recently there have been speculators who have bought this type of bonds at extremely low prices. Once the bonds fall into their hands, crises will arise everywhere, which will lead to an unmanageable situation. Therefore, I hope that all creditors will carefully consider these two points and wait for the final benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Fire on Baotong Road Last Night <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Five Buildings Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>The Guixiangcun grocery and cigarette paper store at No. 451 Baotong Road, at the intersection of Zhonghua New Road in Zhabei, was not careful and caught fire. Five buildings were reduced to ashes. When the fire broke out, the employees of Guixiangcun store and nearby residents were already asleep. Fortunately, a neighbor reported the fire and the Third Section Fire Brigade drove to put out the fire. Because the fire was very strong, it was not completely extinguished until about an hour later. Although Guixiangcun is a cigarette paper and grocery store, it also sells oil, soy sauce, coal balls, kerosene, etc., so after the fire broke out, it spread very quickly and was out of control in an instant. Whether anyone was burned to death could not be investigated at the time. The Baotong Road Police Station of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau sent police to the scene to suppress the fire when it broke out and detained Zhu Ayu, an employee of Guixiangcun store, to the station for questioning. According to his confession, he was lying upstairs when the fire broke out. After waking up from a dream, he jumped out of the window to escape. The owner of the store is named Fan, and his whereabouts are unknown, but he has fire insurance. The neighbors on the left and right of Guixiangcun are the Hexing Machinery Factory and the Zhou family's residence, which were not affected. In addition, a fire alarm box was originally set up on the roadside for emergencies. However, when the reporter broke the glass, he used too much force, causing the screw to fall off and failing to take effect. And the fire truck arrived at the scene several minutes late.</p>

In an instant, the two bungalows of the Shen family next door were also affected. Fortunately, the fire brigades from each section arrived one after another to put out the fire until dawn. Yang Sansi, the fire starter, was arrested and sent to the Fourth District General Office for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Two Major Robbers in the Huangpu Bureau Robbery Case Executed by Firing Squad <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Two Faces of the Two Major Robbers Before Execution</p>
<p>One Crying Like Rain, One Smiling</p>
<p>Zhang Genbao and Feng Qing, well-known major robbers in the Huangpu River, and Changmao Jinsheng and Shuai Jinfu, who are at large, and others, a total of eight people, on May 30 of last year, Zhang Genbao distributed a box gun to each of them, and hired a small steamer to rob the small steamer of the Huangpu Bureau outside the Rui Rong Iron Factory in Yangshupu, killing two Chinese and foreign engineers on the spot. On June 14, Zhang Genbao, Feng Qing, and Yao Zucheng, who received the stolen goods, were arrested by the water patrol police and sent to the local court. Zhang Genbao directly confessed that the foreign engineer shot him, and the bullet grazed his waist, so he returned the shot and killed the foreign engineer. The Chinese engineer was killed by Changmao Jinsheng. Yao Zucheng claimed that his wife was giving birth at home and he accidentally boarded the stolen ship. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution in accordance with the Law on Punishing Bandits and sentenced Zhang Genbao and Feng Qing to death and Yao Zucheng to two years of imprisonment. The case was immediately submitted to the Provincial Government for review and should be executed by firing squad. Yesterday, the court was ordered to execute the sentence. At noon, the court sent a confidential letter to Chief Prosecutor Liu of the Prosecutor's Office, who appointed the original handler, Prosecutor Yang Qi, as the execution supervisor. Because Zhang was a well-known bandit leader, he was supervised by police officer Chen Xihui, who added ten execution police officers, Wang Jianqing, Gu Hanqing, Xu Guoguang, Zou Zhendong, Zhang Chunsen, Zhu Baochang, Jiang Huanzhang, Cao Ziqian, Cai Zuoqing, and Zhang Cheng, all fully armed. At 2:00 p.m., they went to the detention center to take out the two criminals, Zhang Genbao and Feng Qing, and bound them according to the law. When they were escorted onto the car, Feng Qing's wife was coming to visit. When she saw this situation, she burst into tears, which was very miserable. The police officers then pushed the two criminals onto the car and drove quickly to the Second Prison in Caohejing. At this time, He Dafu, the head of the water patrol police, also went to the scene with Bao Tan Ge Changsheng to watch the execution. Prosecutor Yang immediately took the seat with Warden Dong Changmin and Secretary Li Ting. When asked, Feng Qing confessed that he was 29 years old, from Pudong, and had been a boat rocker. He lived at No. 75 Shanhoushan, Xinhui. He requested to write a letter to the Shunxing Pavilion in Shanhoushan, Xinhui, to hand it over to his father-in-law, Chen Wengui, to collect the body and asked to take care of his children. His wife was still young, and he told her to recruit a man to take care of her and asked his two sisters to take care of her. After saying this, tears fell like rain. His attachment to his family was very miserable. A person who is about to die speaks well. Later, Zhang Genbao was brought up for questioning. He was 24 years old, from Pudong. He asked to send a letter to the Wanshengtai shoe store in Zhongshi, Yangjiadu, to hand it over to his maternal uncle, Xu Xisheng, and to ask his new sister-in-law to pay 450 yuan and ask Mr. Zhu and Lawyer Zhou to return 160 yuan. The 450 yuan was for his family to use, and the 160 yuan was to compensate his maternal uncle's losses. He did not want to collect his body. The money for collecting the body was better used at home. When a person dies, he is mashed into meat sauce and does not know anything. Why bother to bury him? Death is death anyway, but our death is a little ugly. Please shoot us immediately. He also said that he and Sheng Genbao, who had been executed by the headquarters, were brothers. He had kidnapped a Chen family and got more than 100,000 yuan. He never robbed less than a thousand yuan. He usually spent money lavishly. He had been a thief more than once and should have died long ago. But this time he did not rob much and was really fooled by Changmao Jinsheng. His attitude of defying the law was not changed until his death, and his smiling expression was unchanged. The judge then ordered the execution. Chen directed the police to take him down for execution by firing squad. After the inspectors inspected the bodies, they were taken away for burial.</p>

<p>Merchants Complain About Collecting Debts</p>
<p>Wusong Power Lines Suddenly Broken</p>
<p>At about 9:00 p.m. the night before (the 11th), it suddenly snowed in Shanghai, with snowflakes as large as goose palms. It seemed that it would not stop soon, but it cleared in less than 20 minutes. At midnight, six-petaled flowers fell again, and Shanghai became a jade world. Yesterday the weather was gloomy, and the rain master and the wind god came one after another. The rain was even heavier at night, the roads were muddy and difficult to walk, and pedestrians complained. At the end of the lunar year, merchants are accustomed to collecting debts everywhere, but they all sighed in despair when they saw this situation. Also, at about 10:00 p.m. the night before, it snowed heavily in Wusong. The wooden power poles, initially crushed by the snow, were broken by the wind. It is estimated that dozens of poles were broken on Fort Taiwan, Baoshan County Road, Taixing Road, and Tongji Road. Therefore, the phones in Songbao and Tongji were not working yesterday. Dai Zhongqiu, the manager of the Songyang Telephone Company, personally led the mechanics to inspect the roads and immediately hired workers to repair them in order to facilitate traffic. It will take about three or four days to fully restore the lines. Also, the snow in the Pudong area was no less than six or seven inches thick. The farmland and roads were all white, and the jade buildings and pavilions became a silver world. The roads with frequent travelers were still covered with snow in the morning, and people could walk on them. However, in the afternoon, the weather warmed up and gradually melted, and the main roads showed signs of mud.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Eight Cases of Kidnapping by Bandit Leader Wang Zhixiang <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Four Cases Did Not Occur in the Public Concession</p>
<p>Wang Committed Too Many Crimes to Remember</p>
<p>Shu Xiaogou, a resident of Gaoxie Ao, Zhoushan, Dinghai County, Zhejiang Province, was kidnapped on the ninth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar. The bandits wrote to his family, intending to demand 10,000 yuan. The negotiation location was with Chinese Detective Wang Changgen and undercover detectives Wang Yingjie and Yan Ji of the Zha Old Gate Police Station in Shanghai. Yu Jinfang, Ni Ronggao, Wang Zhixiang (also known as Wang Biezui and Wang Haixiang), Cao Tongyu, Zou Jierui, Xia Zicheng, Zhao Ayu, Cao Xingzhang, and other eight bandits from Ningbo were arrested at the Lao Ding Sheng Hotel and Lingnan Hotel and sent to the Special District Court. Ni Ronggao confessed that Shu Xiaogou had been beaten to death inside a coffin near the Land God Temple in Xujia Village, Zhoushan, after being kidnapped. Wang Zhixiang confessed that he was the leader of the gang and had committed eight kidnapping cases, including the kidnapping of Bei Runsheng. The court ordered a postponement and ordered an investigation into Shu's body. It is now known that Shu was indeed killed, with one gunshot wound to each of his head, heart, and waist. The body has been inspected by Dinghai County, and the family has been ordered to claim the body. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Hanting of the Special Court continued the trial in a criminal court. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that, excluding Yu Jinfang and Ni Ronggao, whose crime of kidnapping Shu took place in the interior, Wang Zhixiang, although he was aware of this case, had committed four kidnapping cases in the concession. Wang had previously confessed to eight cases, but the other four cases were not prosecuted because they did not occur in the Public Concession. As for the remaining five defendants, the police station found no evidence and originally intended to withdraw the charges. However, according to the Criminal Procedure Law, a defendant who has been publicly prosecuted cannot have the charges withdrawn. It is also unknown whether Dinghai County needs to transfer the five defendants, so they are temporarily detained at the police station. Today, only Wang Zhixiang was brought to court regarding the cases of kidnapping Shi Jiufeng, Liang Huibao, Wu Fangpu, and Wu Songyan. He will now present each case individually for questioning. The first case is the kidnapping of Shi Jiufeng. On the morning of February 24, 1928, at 9:00 AM, Shi was kidnapped by bandits about 200 yards away from his home at 237 Xinji Bang Road and taken to 19 East Yokohama Road. Later, the Jing'an Temple Police Station cracked the case, and the bandits opened fire and resisted arrest. The police returned fire, killing three bandits and injuring one West Deputy Police Chief. Two bandits, Wang Wenhui and Zhou Yuesheng, were captured. According to their confessions, a person named Wang was the leader. The police then showed them photos of all suspects and photos of previous offenders borrowed from the French Police Station. The two identified Wang Zhixiang's photo from the French Police Station, saying that he was the person named Wang. This can be testified to by West Police Chief Gellerber. Wang has also confessed to this. The second case is Liang Huibao, who was kidnapped on Peng Road on December 6, 1927. When the car reached Laobaizi Road, Liang shouted for help and was shot to death by the bandits. In this case, the police arrested Ma Guisheng, Zhu Xiaomao, and Zhang Binglin, all of whom confessed to Wang Zhixiang's involvement. The third case is Wu Fangpu, the compradore of Mitsui &amp; Co., who was kidnapped on Tibet Road on October 25, 1928, and held at 409 Minhou Lane, Hartung Road, for about five days. The bandits moved Wu, who was guarded by a bandit who walked and did not ride in a car. When Wu saw the police, he shouted wildly. The police arrested a bandit named Zhou Ziyun, and Wu was rescued. Zhou confessed that Wang Zhixiang was involved. The fourth case is Wu Songyan, the owner of Da Lun Silk Factory, who was kidnapped at the intersection of Qipu Road and North Fujian Road on September 6, 1928, and later ransomed for 70,000 yuan. Wang Zhixiang received 11,500 yuan. Wu did not report the case to the police station, so the details are unknown. Then, Wang Zhixiang's confession was presented to the court. Shi Jiufeng, a Ningbo native who works in hardware, testified that he did not know Wang Zhixiang and described the kidnapping. Liang Huibao's son, lawyer Liang Yuming, submitted evidence, but since he was not present at the scene, he could not provide proof. Wu Fangpu, 54 years old, from Hangzhou, testified that the bandits moved him due to internal strife. He had never seen Wang Zhixiang. Wu Songyan did not appear. Lawyer Yan Luqi appeared on his behalf and stated that Wu had gone to his hometown of Huzhou for business and could not attend the court. He presented Wu's letter as evidence. Wang Zhixiang was questioned and confessed to receiving 11,500 yuan in the Wu Songyan case. Although he admitted to the cases, he attributed them all to others. Judge Zhou Han questioned him about the case details and his accomplices, but Wang claimed that his mind was unclear and he did not remember anything. He stated that the confession presented by the police station was indeed written by him and contained no errors. He asked the court to convict him based on the confession and not to question him further. Judge Zhou reviewed the confession and ordered a postponement for further investigation, as the case still required investigation.</p>

<p>Head and Hands in a Leather Suitcase</p>
<p>Headless Body in a Bamboo Basket</p>
<p>Appears to Be a Foreigner</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Chinese Detectives Pang Ruiqing and undercover detective Xu Guirong of the Yangshupu Police Station were dispatched to patrol within their jurisdiction. Near the wasteland at the intersection of Baker Road and Taopeng Road, they found a leather suitcase and a bamboo basket that had been discarded. They opened the suitcase and were shocked to find a dismembered female corpse's head, two hands, and two feet. Upon inspecting the basket, they found a headless body inside. The face and other parts were covered with lime, making it impossible to identify. After detailed inspection, the victim appeared to be around 20 to 30 years old, with small feet. The clothes were also blurry and seemed to belong to a foreigner. The detectives carried the body to the forensic examination office on Fellen Road, awaiting a report to the Special District Court for an examination by a committee member. They also reported the situation to the police chief and ordered the detectives to conduct a detailed investigation into the cause of the case and arrest the perpetrators for investigation. Based on the circumstances, it is speculated that the case was caused by rape and murder.</p>

<p>All Robbers Flee Without Looting</p>
<p>Around 7:00 PM the previous evening, several robbers with northern accents, each holding a handgun, broke into Chengfeng Woolen Shop at 92 Tianzhu Church Street, Xiangyu Lane, in the French Concession, intending to rob it. Upon entering, they displayed their handguns and threatened the chauffeur, A Xi. While they were searching for loot, Wu Jinkui, the bodyguard of the shop, spotted them, dodged under the stairs, pulled out his handgun, and fired two shots at the robber who was keeping watch. The robber was hit in the chest and abdomen and fled outside while wounded. The remaining robbers, startled by the gunshots, panicked and fled without looting. The wounded robber collapsed and died in front of 29 Zhu Baozai Road. The police station dispatched detectives to carry the robber's body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for a post-mortem examination. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Division of the French Police Station reported to Judge Zhu of the French Concession Court, who determined that the unidentified robber died from gunshot wounds sustained during a robbery. As no family members were found, he ordered that photos be taken and that the body be collected and buried by the hall.</p>

<p>Husband, Wife, and Daughter All Perish Together</p>
<p>In the French Concession, at 3 Fuzhi Lane, south end of Beile Road and Bubu Road, a loft was rented to a couple from Hubei Province (both around 50 years old) and a girl about ten years old. The previous night, due to the cold weather, the husband lit a coal briquette stove for warmth. When they went to sleep, they did not extinguish the stove, resulting in all three being poisoned at the same time. It was not until yesterday afternoon that the sub-landlord noticed and pried open the door, finding the husband and wife and the girl dead. The girl's left leg had been burned black by the fire, and she was bleeding from the mouth, presumably due to falling near the stove after being poisoned, resulting in burns. The landlord reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to carry the three bodies to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for a post-mortem examination. It is reported that the deceased had no relatives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Truth About the Wang Zhigao Property Dispute <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The recent report about Wang Zhigao suing Wang Zhixue and Wang Zhenhuan, owners of Wang Yutai Tea House, for ancestral property was based on the plaintiff Wang Zhigao's complaint. Here is a more detailed account of the case based on inquiries from various parties:</p>
<p>Wang Xianyong of Jixi had three sons: Lizheng (the eldest), Lihuan (the second), and Lizhu (the third). In the early years of the Xianfeng era, Xianyong divided his self-acquired fields and houses among the three sons according to their families, each pursuing their own business. Three copies of the property division documents were created as proof. After the division, Lihuan and Lizhu stayed home to farm and study, while Lizheng went out to trade. He first came to Shanghai as an apprentice in a store. After many years of hard work, he saved over a hundred yuan and established Wang Yutai Tea House in Nanshi, which is the foundation of today's tea house. This was an independent business created by Lizheng after the property division. In Jixi, after Lizheng left, the area was affected by war within a few years. Lihuan died in the disaster, and the properties and division documents of each branch were burned. Lizheng, however, always supported the lives of his brothers in his hometown. In the 25th year of Guangxu, Lizheng's eldest son, Zhixue (the defendant in this case), Lihuan's adopted son, Zhigao (the plaintiff in this case), and Lizhu's son, Zhijing, wrote three copies of a document stating that the ancestral property had already been divided and re-established the division agreement, with each signing their names. Ten relatives, clan chiefs, and intermediaries also signed as witnesses. The facts were clear, and there was no dispute for more than thirty years. Unexpectedly, seeing Wang Yutai Tea House prospering, Wang Zhigao suddenly sued for ancestral property in the French Concession Public Court in May 1929, using similar language as in the current complaint. Wang Pinxue refuted the allegations with factual evidence. Zhigao, knowing he could not win, requested mediation. Zhixue agreed out of clan affection. Zhigao then wrote a document withdrawing the lawsuit, personally signing his name, with witnesses Hu Shi and the lawyers Wang Tingjie, Lu Shaozong, Yao Zhaodi, and Qin Liankui signing as witnesses. The full text of the document is recorded below:</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Lawsuit Declaration by Wang Zhigao: Regarding Wang Zhigao's ancestor, Xianyong, who had three sons, Lizheng (the eldest), Lihuan (the second), and Lizhu (the third), all the ancestral property was inherited by the three branches in the early years of the Xianfeng era. Due to the chaos of the times, the property division documents were lost. Therefore, in the 25th year of the Guangxu era, Zhixue (the eldest son), Zhigao (the second son, i.e., myself), and Zhijing (the third son) re-established a document with the help of relatives, clan chiefs, and intermediaries, explaining the previous situation. Because Zhigao is the adopted son of Lihuan, he received ten mu of fields and a plot of land from Zhixue, which was also documented by relatives and intermediaries. Both documents were signed by Zhigao, Zhixue, and Zhijing. Most of the relatives who signed are now deceased, but the relatives Shan Yu and the intermediary Cheng Shangtian are still alive. Once verified, the truth will be clear. However, Zhigao's situation is dire, unlike Zhixue and Zhijing, who can support themselves. Last year, he entrusted lawyer Wang Tingjie to send a letter to Zhixue, ostensibly requesting property division but actually hoping to receive some assistance. Zhixue, misunderstanding Zhigao's intention, firmly refused, entrusting lawyer Qin Liankui to reply. Zhigao, in a moment of anger, hastily filed a lawsuit in the French Concession Mixed Court, claiming that the Wang Yutai Tea House, operated solely by Lizheng's branch, was common property, and requesting the seizure of properties in Hangzhou and Shanghai, almost completely severing brotherly ties. Fortunately, while preparing the lawsuit, Zhigao informed his lawyer of the long-analyzed real situation. Under the lawyer's guidance, he voluntarily reconciled. He immediately went to Zhixue, declaring his error and requesting no counter-suit. He obtained Zhixue's understanding, who, mindful of Zhigao's sincerity and repentance, treated him generously, promising not to pursue previous debts and providing funds for his return home. On the day of signing, through the certifying lawyer, the funds were paid in full. Zhigao, having realized his error, vowed to reform. In addition to submitting a statement withdrawing the lawsuit and promising no further disputes, he specifically wrote a personal declaration withdrawing the lawsuit, which was handed over to Zhixue for safekeeping. If he ever again contemplates receiving property from other branches, he agrees to be gathered by the clan and removed from the family genealogy, no longer considered a descendant of the Wang family. This document was submitted by Zhigao to the French Concession Public Court for record and the lawsuit was withdrawn. Therefore, the Wang Zhigao property dispute was legally resolved and settled. Unexpectedly, Zhigao, in October of last year, invited his brother Zhijing to sue Zhixue and his son Zhenhuan in the French Public Court, requesting the division of ancestral property. Zhixue and others hired lawyer Shen Junru to argue in court. Subsequently, the French Public Court, on December 22, ruled to reject the plaintiff Wang Zhigao's lawsuit. The ruling stated, "In the case of Wang Zhigao and Wang Zhijing, the plaintiffs, and Wang Zhixue and Wang Zhenhuan, the defendants, regarding the dispute over the division of ancestral property, after questioning both parties, the defendant submitted a reconciliation document dated August 1, 1929, and requested the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit. This court has instructed to await a ruling on file. Upon investigation of the reconciliation document, there is no fixed form or requirement for signatures from both parties. Since the document has been filed with this court, it should be considered valid. The plaintiff's lawsuit cannot be established. However, the second plaintiff, Wang Zhijing, is not listed in the document and can file a separate lawsuit. This court will schedule a separate hearing to begin the debate. Furthermore, according to the plaintiff's request to withdraw the lawsuit on December 9 of this year, this court originally intended to settle the matter peacefully, and the defendant has not filed a counterclaim. Therefore, the plaintiff's request should be approved. This is the ruling." This shows that the matter has indeed been legally resolved. However, Wang Zhigao continues to litigate, filing a lawsuit in the Special District Court this January regarding the same incident. The court heard the case on the 5th of this month in the Ninth Court. The defendant hired lawyer Zhang Yaozeng to represent him in court. Lawyer Zhang argued that the subject matter of the lawsuit had already been reconciled, and the defendants' residences were not in the Public Concession. The case involved the division of ancestral property and was not related to the business operations of Wang Yutai Tea House. Therefore, it was inappropriate to base jurisdiction on a business establishment in the Public Concession. He immediately requested the court to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit to avoid unnecessary litigation. The court ordered that the matter be heard and ruled upon. It is reported that the Special District Court declared its ruling yesterday, dismissing the plaintiff Wang Zhigao's lawsuit.</p>

<p>Truly Daring</p>
<p>Yu Debiao, a 21-year-old man from Haiyan, was originally from a good family and had worked in a sauce garden, possessing a membership card from the Soy Sauce Industry Association. Due to his fondness for extravagance, he lived alone in the Zhongxing Inn. Every day, he would go to various shops or business places under the pretext of soliciting business, stealing items. In these two months, he had committed over twenty such thefts. Unexpectedly, he recently escalated his activities, forgetting the consequences. Yesterday morning, at 10:00 AM, he actually stole a scarf belonging to Chen Ma, the housewife of the court's kitchen, and a watch belonging to the cook, Ding Gouda, from inside the court kitchen. He was discovered by the kitchen staff and chased down. He boarded a rickshaw to escape but was apprehended by guard Zhang Chunsen and taken into custody. Twenty-five pawn tickets and a trade union membership card were found on him. The matter was reported to the prosecutor, who, upon learning that the thief had stolen from the very court that handles thieves, deemed his actions extremely audacious. He ordered the thief to be detained for serious prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Jiang Youzhi's Letter to the French Public Court <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Xinsheng Society reports that the divorce case between lawyer Dong Yu and his wife has been heard several times by the French Public Court without a result. It is reported that Jiang Youzhi sent another letter to the French Public Court yesterday, detailing the circumstances of being forced to sign the divorce papers and requesting a fair judgment. The letter states: Regarding the divorce case between the defendant Jiang and the plaintiff Dong Jingxi (Dong Yu), the court has heard the case multiple times. The incident of being forced to sign at the New World Hotel provides a crucial reference for this case. Please present this to the judge. Since being ostracized by the plaintiff, the defendant has been borrowing accommodation from Dong Kang. Dong Kang, because of the defendant's poor judgment in choosing a spouse, bears lifelong regret. He is sympathetic and treats her as one of his daughters, so she calls him adoptive father. Last year, when Mr. Lu passed away, the plaintiff told the adoptive father that he wanted to divorce the defendant. The adoptive father strongly disapproved, urging them to reconcile. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff did not listen, leading to this lawsuit. The adoptive father repeatedly called the plaintiff to his home, reasoning with him to withdraw the lawsuit and consider a separation. However, the plaintiff was confused, believing that someone was hindering the matter and making threatening remarks. On the first of this month, the adoptive father went to the communication office jointly operated by Wang Lianghou and Fan Songji on Aiduya Road. Lawyer Wang said that Fan Songji, who has a sworn brotherhood with the plaintiff, was willing to negotiate the matter. The adoptive father also met with Fan while investigating other matters. Fan Songji said that reconciliation was currently difficult. If they could stick to the agreement, they might be able to reconcile in the future. He suggested temporarily separating with 3,000 yuan and a reasonable allowance for the education of the young daughter. He was willing to act as a mediator. The adoptive father agreed to convey the message and stated that he would only agree after the cousin Dong Banggan returned to Shanghai to discuss the guardianship conditions. On the second, lawyer Wang summoned the defendant to the communication office to meet Fan Songji. Although the defendant was pressured by the consensus, she did not fully agree. At 9:00 PM on the third afternoon, the adoptive father received an invitation from Fan and Wang from the New World Hotel. The adoptive father accompanied the defendant to room 239 to talk, assuming that they were discussing conditions to avoid rumors. He asked the adoptive mother, Ms. Chi, to accompany the defendant. It was heard that the plaintiff was also in the next room. At that time, there were many men and women who inquired about the situation. Some expressed outrage, while others offered gentle persuasion. Fan Songji conveyed the plaintiff's words and asked lawyer Wang to draft a divorce agreement, and lawyer Zhan Jifeng was invited to the scene to witness. The divorce agreement was purchased and they were asked to sign it that night. At this time, the defendant was extremely troubled, and the situation remained unresolved for three hours. After the adoptive father telegraphed the situation, he first spoke with lawyer Zhan, requesting that he inform them how to arrange the matter after the divorce and that all considerations must be taken into account. The speaker asserted that they had no legal right to speak, because the speaker was not legally authorized to assert anything. The speaker insisted on waiting for the cousin to return to Shanghai before deciding. Immediately, the speaker accompanied the defendant and others to return. On the fourth, they were summoned by the court. The plaintiff asserted four points: (1) Because the adoptive father entrusted the former agent lawyer Sheng Shengxi to express the situation of forced signing, he said that witnesses did not have the law of entrusting a lawyer to represent them, and refused to speak. (2) He said that indefinite postponement was the custom of the court, and the lawyer could not know, and criticized Wang's lawyer for lack of experience. (3) He said that after the divorce, the defendant was separated from the Dong family and listened to her survival, without the need for the head of the family to seek protection. (4) Chen pointed out the contract drafted by lawyer Wang, pointing to the acquiescence to this matter. The speaker purely manipulated it. The speaker investigated the first and second points as legal issues that the defendant did not know. The third point was that the plaintiff indulged in sound and color, lacking the morality of husband and wife, treating the defendant far less than a maid. Once abandoned, it would be possible to let her drift. In the case of the defendant, the shame of being cast down would be engraved in her mind and the life would still have to be maintained by the husband and mother's family. In addition, the young daughter Yan Sheng was only eight years old. It was the blood of the Dong family. How could the mother's family sever relations together? The fourth point certainly alluded to the adoptive father. The adoptive father's sincere persuasion was his original intention. If he was said to have manipulated it, it was a pseudonym for waiting for a good price, with the words of contempt for a person who had been cultivated and claimed to be obedient to his elders. Although the name was not explicitly mentioned, the speaker was spared criminal liability, and the speaker's conscience was not to be desired. The above points, if there are public opinions, there is no need to sort them out. The court should hear that the plaintiff is slightly familiar with poetry and etiquette and is ashamed to accept this condition. Reviewing the plaintiff's first statement, the divorce was based on the defendant's illness of pulmonary disease. Whether pulmonary disease is a condition for divorce and whether the defendant had pulmonary disease should still be judged by the court according to law, which is true convenience. Respectfully to the French Public Court of the Shanghai French Concession.</p>

<p>Falsely Claiming a Nephew of Mao Jingen is Getting Married</p>
<p>Sending Out Five to Six Hundred Invitations</p>
<p>Recently, new scams have emerged in Shanghai. Someone even impersonated a detective to swindle money from various places. It has been reported that someone impersonated Zhang Ziying, a detective of the French Police Station, and defrauded 500 yuan from a customs broker. It has now been learned that a rogue recently impersonated Mao Jingen, a detective of the special agency of the French Police Station, and sent out invitations (commonly known as "striking autumn wind"), falsely claiming that Mao Tank's nephew, Mao Kaixiang, would be married on February 11 of the solar calendar, which is December 24 of the lunar calendar. His home was said to be at 10 Xinmin Lane, Arber Road, and the banquet was to be held at Fuxingyuan Restaurant, Pingwang Street, Wuma Road. A total of five to six hundred invitations were sent. Detective Mao learned of the matter and, considering the perpetrators' audacity, reported it to the police chief. He also went to 10 Xinmin Lane and Fuxingyuan Restaurant to arrest them, but the perpetrators had already fled. Detective Mao reported back to the police chief, who ordered him to arrest them for investigation.</p>

<p>Aunt Hu Reports to the Police and Deters the Robbers</p>
<p>Female Robber Throws Away Items and Flees</p>
<p>Hu Baoli, from Anhui, engages in the bamboo and wood business and is very wealthy. He built his own house at 23 Santaidock, Nanshi. The house is quite spacious and richly decorated, attracting the attention of bandits. The day before yesterday, Hu's aunt suddenly heard urgent knocking on the door. She opened the door and saw a beautiful woman wearing a black cloak and high-heeled leather shoes, dressed fashionably. She was carrying a basket of tangerines and two boxes of dry snacks, claiming that they were gifts sent by the Chen family. Upon hearing that they were gifts, Hu's aunt ordered someone to open the door and welcome her in. However, upon closer inspection, she found the woman's face unfamiliar. As she was about to inquire about the details, two unexpected guests suddenly broke in, immediately drawing handguns from their pockets, warning her not to make a sound. At this point, Hu's aunt realized she had encountered robbers. She quickly shook her head at the two robbers, signaling them not to shoot, and said, "What do you want? Just take whatever you need." As she spoke, she stepped back and quickly closed the door to the side room, then escaped out the back door. She used the telephone to notify the district's police station. After receiving the report, the station chief, along with Inspector Sun and Police Chief Liu, rushed to the scene to encircle and arrest the robbers. At that time, the robbers saw that Hu's aunt had escaped and realized that the situation was unfavorable. They immediately turned around and fled. The woman who had knocked on the door with the gifts also quickly discarded the items she was carrying and fled with the two robbers towards the Bund. The police team failed to capture them, so they took the gifts abandoned by the woman back to the station. Yesterday, they prepared a document to report to Director Chen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for instructions.</p>

<p>Three Criminals Have Been Arrested</p>
<p>The western suburbs of Shanghai are remote, and it is dangerous for pedestrians at night. The Putuo Road Police Station dispatches detectives every night to patrol the area for protection. On the night of the fourth of this month, Detective Yuan Xinzhong was patrolling the entrance of a lane on Lubansheng Road when he saw a suspicious person. He immediately arrested him. Unexpectedly, two accomplices suddenly came out of the lane. One of them stabbed Yuan in the face and abdomen with a knife, causing him to be wounded and bleeding. The arrested bandit was rescued. Yuan, wounded, hired a car to report to the police station. The police chief ordered him to go to the hospital for treatment and instructed the detectives to strictly investigate and arrest the criminals for punishment. The night before last, Detective Zhao Fuhai arrested a criminal named Lou Jinbao from Shandong Province at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Lubansheng Road. He also went to a thatched house at 150 Xiaoshadu Road and found the knife used to stab Yuan, a flashlight, and fourteen pawn tickets. Upon questioning, he learned that an accomplice named Wang Shunhe was hiding at 123 Sanguantang Street, Nanshi. He immediately coordinated with the police station to arrest Wang. Soon after, the police station arrested Xu Guangfa in Shiba Jian, Pudong, who was also involved in the Yuan stabbing case. Currently, except for Xu, who is temporarily detained by the Public Security Bureau, Lou and Wang were sent to the Special District Court yesterday morning for investigation. However, Detective Yuan is still receiving treatment in the hospital, and Xu has not been formally charged. Therefore, police station lawyer Wang Yaotang requested a postponement. After Judge Cheng conducted a preliminary trial, he ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor, Yesterday, your newspaper's local news column mentioned that Tongyang steamships were also suspended, which is inconsistent with the facts. After checking, the inland river steamship bureaus affiliated with our association had already resolved in the executive committee meeting to strictly abide by the orders of the central and municipal party and government agencies and observe the national calendar and abolish the lunar New Year's Day, generally without suspending navigation. A notice was issued to all steamship bureaus to comply. Therefore, all bureaus operated as usual, and there was no suspension of navigation. However, a few cargo steamship bureaus use the availability of goods as the standard. They operate when there are goods and stop when there are no goods, so there is no fixed schedule. Even if one or two bureaus do not operate, it is not related to the abolition of the lunar New Year's Day. This letter is to inform you, hoping for correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Inland River Steamship Bureau Association, February 12, 20</p>
<p>Dear Editor, After checking, the news article "Dong Yu Divorce Case" published in your newspaper on the 10th contains content that is inconsistent with the facts. According to the defendant representative lawyer, although Dong Yu was in court on the same day to defend, if he had a power of attorney. Since there is no power of attorney, please prohibit the request from being issued, and the Gong court official did not pay attention to this. Therefore, I continued to speak in the capacity of Jiang's agent lawyer, and it lasted for half an hour. According to the French court, there is no regulation for submitting a power of attorney. Although some people have submitted a power of attorney recently, I obtained the qualification of agent before the new law was enacted, so naturally it is a legal agent. Dong Yu, as a lawyer, also understands this. Therefore, he declared this in court, fearing that the rumors would be inconsistent with the facts and related to my reputation. For this reason, I sent a letter to your newspaper, requesting correction and publishing the original letter in the letters to the editor column to show the truth. Sincerely, Sheng Shengxiu, lawyer, February 12</p>

<h3 id="e181">The Ethnic Groups of the Southern Wilderness <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>By Wei Juezhong, Man Yin</p>
<p>Everyone knows that we are now in the era of the 20th century, an era of civilization and evolution, from the Stone Age and Iron Age to the age of machines. In this era, human social organization has also changed from primitive communist society and feudal society to industrial society. In the metropolises of Europe, America, Japan, and China, we see skyscrapers, prosperous and splendid streets, cars, trams, dance halls, and playgrounds, all of which are extravagant and cater to people's use and entertainment, demonstrating the capabilities of material progress to the fullest. In the countryside, especially in the countryside of our China, which is known as an ancient country, drastic changes are now also obviously taking place, a change that is different from the old, simple past. Whether in politics or economics, as long as I pay attention, I can feel it.</p>
<p>In short, in modern society, whether in the city or in the countryside, in Europe and America or in East Asia, almost the entire globe makes us feel that human society has undergone many changes, changes from the embryo of the old society to the form of the new society. Only slowly did we have today. Undoubtedly, this change is the progress of human culture and the development of social systems. Therefore, it is difficult for us to believe that there are still uncivilized humans and undeveloped societies like our ancestors thousands of years ago on this same earth and in the same era.</p>
<p>However, friends, let's take a look at this book, "The Ethnic Groups of the Southern Wilderness," written by Wei Juezhong. Compare the life of the natives of Southeast Asia recorded in this book with what we call civilized humans. What feelings should arise?</p>
<p>Mr. Wei is a traveler who has ambitions to travel the world. He has been drifting in the south for seven years. Therefore, this book not only makes him feel that "what is described in the book is based on what the author has personally heard and seen, and I am confident that it is different from those who have never set foot in Southeast Asia but talk about it lavishly," but also makes us readers never feel that someone is making up stories and lying to us. The entire book is divided into two volumes. The first volume describes the life of the savage Gaya people of Dutch New Guinea, and the second volume describes the Wata ethnic group between the east coast of Sumatra and Tapannuli. Each volume contains many short stories that can be separated independently. This is probably what the author wrote down while traveling in a hurry. We don't have to be "nitpicking" and blame him for not organizing it into systematic chapters. In fact, this is the only way to truly preserve the travelogue style and interest that combines narrative and commentary.</p>
<p>In the first three chapters of the first volume, we are told about the happy life of the Gaya people, who sing and dance every day, the topography of Gaya and the country to which it belongs, and the origin of its name. Then, it unfolds to the strange customs of the Gaya people, such as the Gaya woman's ideal lover, who is not beautiful, rich, or has a position, but a hero who has killed many people. For the Gaya people's wedding, the bride must first give offerings to relatives and friends, and on the second day, she must also be enjoyed by the elderly and elders in the neighborhood. Two or three days before the wedding, the groom invites two relatives and friends to take the bride as a test product. Aren't these all things that we consider strange?</p>
<p>There are also many other habits that we have never heard of, like primitive aborigines, such as those described in the chapters "Life and Death," "The Gaya People's Mathematics," "A Good Skill," "The Sky as a Tent and the Earth as a Seat," "Natural Disasters," and "Anarchy." Due to space limitations, I won't go into detail.</p>
<p>The second volume describes the Wata people, just like the first volume. However, in fact, the living habits of the Wata people are very different from those of the Gaya people. For example, the Gaya people can share their wives, while the Wata people absolutely do not allow it. Unmarried women of the Wata people can flirt with any man (those with the same surname are not included), while the Gaya people cannot. The Wata people have surnames and know how to grow rice and store it, while the Gaya people cannot do any of these. In the chapter "Practitioners of Free Love," the love life of Wata girls is described, which is quite strange to us, because in most places in human sexual life, men are active and women are passive, but Wata girls are not.</p>
<p>Looking at the Wata ethnic group described in the second volume as a whole, it is much more evolved than the Gaya people in the first volume, because the former seems to have reached the period of hunting, animal husbandry, and cultivation, while the latter is still stuck in the period when primitive people only know how to collect animals and plants from nature for a living. However, compared with us Eurasian people, who have progressed to the era of using machines, what will it be like? At present, on the same earth, some humans have evolved to the era of fire wheels, airplanes, and almost electricity, while other humans are still stuck in the life of primitive people. Mr. Wei now takes the customs and habits of that part of humanity that is still stuck in the life of primitive people and writes them into a book. As Mr. Zheng Hongnian, who wrote the preface to this book, said, "It is enough to provide materials for the study of anthropology and folklore for scholars around the world." Mr. Liu Shimu said, "How can the benefits to scholars who study society be shallow?"</p>
<p>On the other hand, this book's record of the abuse and downfall of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia also greatly stimulates our readers' national consciousness. Although the author does not have a special chapter on this, it can be seen between the lines:</p>
<p>"......Dutch officials forbid overseas Chinese from carrying coconuts......"</p>
<p>Page 74</p>
<p>"......Any Chinese who marries a Gaya woman will be forced to divorce, and the children born will also be forced to be given to the aborigines......" Page 75</p>
<p>"......After the European War, the Dutch imposed a so-called (30%) war tax in their territory......As a result, countless overseas Chinese went bankrupt." Same page</p>
<p>"In various places in the Dutch colony, opium is sold publicly by the government, and 90% of opium smokers are our overseas Chinese, spending tens of millions of guilders every year." Page 76</p>
<p>"As many of our compatriots are missing in Southeast Asia as there are sands in the Ganges River, but has anyone ever investigated?" Volume 2, page 4</p>
<p>What a painful cry! The description of the difficulties in trading between overseas Chinese and aborigines in the article "Servants of the Savages" (page 69) is really pitiful.</p>
<p>In recent years, our government has gradually paid attention to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and many people have aspired to study Southeast Asia and travel to Southeast Asia. Several books on Southeast Asia have also been published in the market. However, I have not seen a book as rich in materials and detailed in records as this book. So, this book can also serve as a reference book for studying Southeast Asian culture.</p>
<p>The author's writing is lively, the sentences are fresh, the narration is concise, and the tone is fluent. There are several ancient poems and many pictures scattered throughout the book. So, this book can also be read as a story novel. I heard that Mr. Wei is still working on the third, fourth, and so on volumes of records about his travels, and he is preparing to depart to the Northeast, travel across the country and around the world soon. Here, we sincerely wish him success.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Implementation of Aesthetic Education <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>By Tang Jun</p>
<p>The words "Aesthetic Education" seem to be frequently found in the eyes and writings of Chinese people. The general public seems to attach considerable importance to it. However, where are the achievements of the implementation of aesthetic education? What effects has it had on the public and artists? Whenever we think of these two questions, we will always regret the long delay in developing this great avenue of aesthetic education.</p>
<p>The author is here to discuss "Aesthetic Education" with everyone, not only hoping that readers will express a considerable or enthusiastic sympathy for what I have said, but also hoping that you will expand your sympathy and launch a powerful movement for the implementation of aesthetic education.</p>
<p>"Aesthetic Education" has two meanings: (1) To the public: to popularize art, socialize art, and make art appreciative. In general terms, it is to beautify life and beautify society. (2) To artists: to specialize art and create art. In general terms, it is called "Art Education." The first point is to cultivate a general "aesthetic consciousness" and artistic "appreciation ability" among the public. The second point is to cultivate a general "aesthetic consciousness" and specialized artistic "creation ability" among artists. The so-called "Aesthetic Education" includes these two meanings. This is only when viewed from the receiving end that there is a distinction between "the public" and "artists." But when viewed from the launching end, it is a unified whole.</p>
<p>When we implement aesthetic education for the public, it is not to make every member of the public an artist, but to enable the general public to have the ability and interest to appreciate art, and to instill a kind of "aesthetic consciousness" in the general society. General life must be immersed in a kind of "aesthetic consciousness." Whether it is a public group or a personal residence, social customs, or personal behavior, they should all be shrouded in a kind of "aesthetic atmosphere." In other words, it is to make society artistic and life aesthetic.</p>
<p>When we implement aesthetic education for artists, it is not to use the same model to print them into a uniform appearance, nor is it to hold the same rules of implementation and let them embark on the same road. It is to lead the great souls of artists into the great realm of true art, to present the broad elements needed by artists broadly in front of the artists, so that their inner extension and outer package, psychology and physiology, are influenced and transformed by these environments and materials. Their minds will conceive a beautiful idea, and their eyes and hands will naturally form a great skill. The fusion of this beautiful idea and skill constitutes a strong artistic creation. All works of art are created by this strong force.</p>
<p>The aesthetic education applied to the public mentioned above is generally easy for people to understand. As for the aesthetic education applied to artists, it does not seem to be easily understood by the general public. It is not that they do not understand, but that they do not pay attention. They have not paid attention to this issue. They call the aesthetic education for artists "Art Education." They call the aesthetic education applied to the public the "Aesthetic Education" that they are accustomed to using and shouting. This has created a great crime in art education: the establishment of art schools has erected a great obstacle on the road to the development of art (see my humble book "The Future of Art Schools").</p>
<p>The most important thing for those who implement aesthetic education is to first determine the standard of aesthetic education. Whether it is implemented on the public or on artists, as long as the initiator has considerable faith, the recipient will naturally get a considerable effect.</p>
<p>We can find many examples of the traces of the implementation of aesthetic education from the modern Western art countries (see "Elfo Magazine," my humble work "The Path of the Development of French Art").</p>
<p>First, we can see it from the organization of their public cities: regarding the organization of public cities, there are parks, memorial halls, buildings, sculptures, decorations, etc. The establishment of parks can regulate the noise of the city and cultivate the open-minded emotions of the general public. Memorial halls, buildings, sculptures, etc. can evoke a historical idea in the public and reflect the outline of a formative art in the public. In addition, there are grand art academies that can not only be enjoyed by the general public, but also be studied by artistic geniuses. Art exhibition members also have the same function. Music halls and theaters can not only enable the public to directly enjoy physiological and spiritual pleasure, but also enable artists to be greatly infected in invisible ways to complete their creations. For example, Corot's secluded emotional tone is mostly influenced by the scenery of the Paris National Music Hall (Opera), because Corot often goes to the music hall to watch dramas. There are also open-air concerts, which can enable ordinary people and proletarian artists to enjoy a considerable aesthetic intoxication and arouse the resonance of sensitive geniuses. Such beautiful and artistic environments filling the urban society are good results of the implementation of aesthetic education and good materials for implementing aesthetic education.</p>
<p>Second, we can see it from private residences and clothing: the residences of Westerners can be said to be aestheticized. If we look at their working class, they are all orderly, and the decoration of the living room can also do its best to embellish it. Once we enter their exquisite living room, we recall the chaos of the Chinese people and the lack of aesthetic thinking of the Chinese nation, which is indeed a clear distinction between civilization and savagery. The middle and upper class families have more magnificent villas, surrounded by gardens. The flowers and trees are in full bloom in spring and summer. Living in them is like being in paradise. Compared to those who are more wealthy, they do not hesitate to spend a lot of money to decorate their residences (the author once saw a French company customizing a complete set of living room furniture, including tables, chairs, walls, and all applied items, from the Duran Decoration Factory in France, costing more than 1.5 million French francs, about 300,000 current national currency, and it took 10 months to build this living room). It can be seen how much Westerners value and appreciate art. The author can also say that the French people's artistic hobby is often balanced with their economic situation. If we go to the Loire River area in central France to see the construction of those palaces and their internal decoration, we can know the climax of the French royal family's artistic hobby in the Middle Ages. Other ordinary people can also enjoy their aesthetic pleasures according to their economic situation. We can directly say that the French nation's "art appreciation ability" is cultivated very commonly. If we look at their clothing, especially women and children, they are all very aestheticized. Especially the patterns of the clothes in dance theaters are renewed every day, which can be said to be the best of their beauty. Their daily clothing is designed and pursued by experts all day long, and they are constantly updated. From this, we can see their love for aesthetic hobbies. However, their deep cultivation of "aesthetic consciousness" is not accidental. It is constituted by a historical and social beautification education. Their beautification education circulates with each other and helps each other, creating a firm "backbone consciousness," releasing a harmonious atmosphere for society, and opening beautiful flowers for mankind.</p>
<p>With the above-mentioned aesthetic environment, the French do not talk about beautifying the public, but the public will beautify themselves. They do not talk about art education, but geniuses will become artists. In French society, infants have a harmonious environment surrounding them from the time they are born, and beautiful flowers reflecting on their faces and eyelids. From childhood, they have a good family environment, and as soon as they go out, there are parks, legitimate playgrounds for entertainment, and sculptures, paintings, buildings, and all other practical decorations filling the city to attract their eyes, to stir their emotions, and to cultivate their beautiful minds.</p>
<p>After reading the above, we can know that the implementation of aesthetic education should create a beautiful environment and an artistic environment, such as the establishment of parks, art museums, music halls, theater construction, as well as the carving and painting decoration of all city families. In addition, the instillation of wisdom, the immersion in natural beauty, etc., are all things that people who implement aesthetic education should pay attention to. These direct or indirect environments about beauty and art are necessary tools for the implementation of aesthetic education.</p>
<p>Mr. Veron has a very valuable remark about aesthetic education. He said that "we should develop young people to the gardens of various beautiful emotions, and use various methods to stir up the expansion of that moral strength (Puissance Morape) that is the true source of creating art, refine their senses, arouse their fetal ideas, ignite their ideas, get close to them with general heroism, feed them with various works of art, teach them to understand the greatness of people and human society, and place them in the situation that makes them most likely to give rise to 'aesthetic sense' and 'poetic inspiration'. Finally, use various forms to often make their eyes and ears enjoy a special pleasure: a pure 'aesthetic pleasure' (Jouissance esthetipue) - see Veron's 'Aesthetics' (LEsthetipue) of style." These words are all guides for those who implement aesthetic education. We will not be wrong to base our implementation of aesthetic education on these words.</p>
<p>Those who have always talked about aesthetic education and implemented aesthetic education in China have paid very little attention to the broad and universal aesthetic education mentioned above. They either only talk about a few courses in drawing, music, and handicrafts in normal schools and middle schools, or they rush to open art schools. They only know how to use those teaching courses as a convenience for implementing aesthetic education. With this biased and deformed method of implementing aesthetic education, the author dares to assert that there will not be much effect in a few years. It cannot cultivate a general concept and interest in beauty among the public, nor can it enable geniuses to develop into professional artists. This method of implementing aesthetic education urgently needs to be changed.</p>
