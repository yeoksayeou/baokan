<p>中西探等言之鑿鑿</p>
<p>魯人梁成玉向在老閘捕房充當包探已有多年去年擢升爲兩號華探目調往總巡捕房總稽查處辦公家居南成都路大方里七百五十六號半門牌昨晨九時半</p>
<p>突被稽查處西督察長堯克·華總探長陸連奎·探長劉紹奎·將梁探目押解至特區地方法院第二刑庭控其於四月二十八號夜十一時糾黨至重慶路馬樂里四百三十九號門牌持械以</p>
<p>强暴脅迫手段搶取李連生値洋五萬餘元之嗎啡違犯刑法三百四十</p>
<p>八條等情而被告梁成玉則延葉茀康·袁仰安·譚辛震·三律師李連生亦延鄂森律師到庭代辯首由捕房律師張天蔭起而陳述案情略謂四月二十八號上午七時許有盜匪七人兩執手槍闖至茄勒路文德里一號門牌某公司内搶刦得値洋</p>
<p>五萬元之嗎啡携贓逃入公共租界先置放於大沽路後移至淡水路輾轉而至重慶路老馬樂里四三九號門牌李連生之家内查李即係七盜中之一人迨至夜間十一時許又有盜匪六人兩盜各執手槍闖入李家將前項嗎啡悉數搶去本案被告梁成玉</p>
<p>係六盜中之一即於二十九號早一時至六時之間將嗎嚈分散故贓物迄今查無着落嗣李即報告捕房謂被梁探糾黨搶刦督察長堯克乃着李指認當於六個包探中將被告指出越日又有李之姘婦張阿四赴捕房當由探長又命包探六七人各去長衣及標記將被告雜於其中着張婦指認張婦先指另一包探一百十號者後忽稱錯誤乃指出被告但被告在捕房内則否認云云又據</p>
<p>西督察長堯克投案禀明前情其供詞與張律師所述略同又據李連生投稱本地人年二十五歲向業五金家住重慶路老馬樂里四三九號客堂樓上上月二十八號早七時半我與徐根根（聞已被法捕房拘獲）及王子廉·張先生·等共七人同往茄勒路搶刦得嗎啡四箱價値五萬餘元此事由王起意當時有手槍兩支該槍係張先生所拿事後見張先生以手槍及嗎啡四包携往成都路大方里第六家即梁探目家刦得之嗎啡則先以汽車運往大沽路嗣因</p>
<p>恐汽車夫漏風故移往淡水路未幾又搬往跑馬廳對面周某家内但周家因房屋狹小故又移至我家由我一人看守至夜十一時突有盜匪六人由後門而入逕登客堂樓我之臥室梁探目及朱麻皮并一身軀魁梧之大塊頭各執手槍迫令我交出鑰匙開箱并大聲謂徐根根已被法捕房拘捕</p>
<p>速將貨物交出當先給汝洋三十元迨賣去後再給汝三千元其時梁探目身穿醬色袍子頭戴銅盆帽云與西人同來遂將藏有嗎啡之手提大皮箱一只先行取去正欲搬去其餘箱子之際因時在深夜被司閽之巡捕所阻遂改變方針將我與姘婦張阿四以手槍押往遠東飯店後面敬勝里敬勝旅館九號房間監視商議迨天已黎明五時許派兩人將我看守</p>
<p>兩人伴我姘婦張阿四回家將其餘三箱開啓裝於兩只鞋籃内雇車運去後我遇王姓包探乃將事告之由其帶往督察長處報告并將被告認出等語又據婦人張阿四供揚州人年三十歲李連生係我丈夫其所供之詞大半與李相同故從略詰之被告梁成玉供稱我對於此事完全不知且四月二十八號我已告假并不辦公朱麻皮與大塊頭亦不相識是日我與友人董蘭亭同往法租界遊玩可以傳董到案證明查李連生即方連生又名小連生前因</p>
<p>綁架李惠卿案有關經我往法租界甘司東路捕李未獲并往重慶路李家查抄手槍亦無着有案可稽今實遭誣攀云云末由張天蔭律師向庭上聲明於扣留被告時被告曾向西督察長堯休聲言如能將嗎啡查到可否不將其執赴有司當時堯氏以此言與名譽有關故未允許張律師乃將此意向被告詰問有此事乎而被告則否認之訊至此葛之覃推事以此案尙有展期調查及補傳人證之必要遂諭被告梁成玉押候本月十五號下午再訊李連生·張阿四·准予覊押</p>

<p>— 筠</p>
<p>天黎明時隔壁墳山裏的鳥兒已歌得很起勁正像有用意似的把我從睡夢中呌醒了</p>
<p>腦里深藏着意識那是我决不會忘記了的就是去參觀晨光第五屆畫展「好、早點去」我竟不然的喊出來其興　的情態不言可知了可是爲什麽會使得我有這樣的高興呢至少我相信這次畫展斷不會使我失望而且我對他是有相當的信任尤其是幾位健將新生的作品早已爲我急切地等待着而欲一觀其究竟的了在車中一陣陣清淡的和風繞拂在我的身周眞的是我被晨光迷戀着了使我底心靈活躍着什麽身世的境遇以及種種念頭不知飛向那大洋去而面部的表情只是收不住的笑渦呀</p>
<p>經過了很長的時間晨光的會場　被我踏着眼廉前顯着一幅一幅的畫他們都是有生氣好像在演戲似的引我入勝不消說他們的主人公有的能哭得令人悲傷不已但也有是很氣昂的在吿訴我民族的前途只要努力着可不是光明無量麼</p>
<p>現在且把我留連那兒二小時的印象對於老作家和新進作家的作品随意的談談吧</p>
<p>水彩出品中有宋志欽君和陽太陽君的作品在技巧上　可謂上乘宋君已幾張小品為勝如「溪樹」「村中」「春野」等皆能體貼入微尚無拙處可云成功作矣陽君以「晨之公園」爲特色雖係細小之件但用筆的輕健調色的確當以及空氣的和諧若非高才者當然是不會有這様純熟的描寫力的</p>
<p>關紫蘭女士的繪畫大有日進千里之勢此次出有「肖像」（自畫像）「少女」「靜物」「花」等其中尤以「靜物」一幀爲最佳如畫中蘋果在鑑賞者的眼光中何止要比吃一隻眞蘋果的性趣高得萬倍呵</p>
<p>以索描油繪最負盛名的老作家陳抱一先生這次出品約十幅都能顯出他獨有的老鍊看了他畫的人誰也會知道陳先生已到了登峯造極的境地如「春雨後」「湖光山色」二作我要奇怪他不知是用什麽法子才能描寫出來的看那一座山是怎様的美妙而使人沉醉呢何况還有那艷麗的湖水我没有話來形容只說他神秘吧又「顏之Sketch」及「黄葉」等都是偉大的我覺得陳先生正是同日畫家中川紀元先生等並駕齊驅呢</p>
<p>王道源先生這次雖僅僅一張「跑馬廳」可是他的繪畫技巧當然會使人認　而不要我來贅述了在新出的「前鋒月刋」裏也可以看到這幅挿圖那色　眞是十分的和諧而鮮明呵</p>
<p>黄振中舉徐蘇靈二君的作品也能引人注目的黄君的「馬蘭小姐」較爲遜色外「長沙印象」一幀以災地的苦况爲取材畫出非人間的恐怖狀態幾具臥屍遠處襯以烈火紅光滿天這時境中　民惶急的狀况我們可以從這幅中定能想像得到的徐君的「夜曲」可謂佳作了描寫幾位流浪於街頭的朋友呌出的狂歌是在找宿處呵傷心人能不同情於他們嗎</p>
<p>此外有方幹民氏的「湖畔」陳秋草氏的「鎭海之港」都雪鷗氏的「暮靄」潘思同氏的「青島之夏」都各有長處比各自家以前的作品益加精彩得多了</p>
<p>還有幾位作家如翁元春陸小霞等的作品各有以勝人恕我不一一贅述了</p>
<p>總之這次畫展在質和量上都能使觀者心滿意足同時也確得了不少的暗示……</p>
<p>末了要說的話正是「在現在這様的變動時代民族無一大不在掙扎輿搏鬭的塲合中求生存」想爲民族主義的藝術而努力的幾位作家定能認眞的繼續幹下去來「促進民族向上發展的意志以期形成民族的新生命」我看無論何人都渴望這着様呢實際上才算是負着藝術最大的使命呢</p>

<h3 id="c232">復旦中公籃球賽 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 語溪</p>
<p>那天（四月二十九日）午後我們看復旦中公籃球競標賽</p>
<p>復旦來事汽車來的球員隨員連啦啦員足足裝來了三車人女球員也來了不少花朵般地打操場走過怪引動人所以那天看球的也着實鬧中公學生全體出馬把那小小的東操場重重圍住</p>
<p>球場四週擺長凳長凳坐了人後來的看客被凳欄阻住無論如何擠亦不能越進界線一步這是一個最不費力的使觀衆Ｋeep　line的辦法我希望大規模的足球賽也用這法子省得揮旗者做煞難人趕看客</p>
<p>女生友誼賽先舉行復旦隊員如陳鼎如何萼梅李蓮等都是女子籃球的健將個子旣比中公隊員高（中公隊員一半是倭胖子）球藝方面也比中公進步所以六與十二的結果似乎並不意外</p>
<p>不過中公隊中亦未使沒有出色的角兒譬如張兆和便是一個頗有希望的球員中公總共得六分那六分全是她一手擲得的當然在這次比賽中她是最出風頭的一個了</p>
<p>但風頭出得愈大苦頭也吃得愈多當蜜絲張正玩得起勁的當兒不料脚一滑跌了地面雨濕未乾跌得衣衫沾染污泥看客大家笑其實打球跌跤正表示勇健笑實無理由</p>
<p>但看客的無理由正不止此一端呢</p>
<p>比如當她們捉着球擲藍的時候男人們便學着女聲喊Shoo—這是什麽意思呢還有當裁判員稍稍有一些不妥的地方便唏或呼打那是更無謂了</p>
<p>我們看客衹有看不能干涉場上的「行政」在適當的時候拍拍手或Yell幾聲以資鼓勵是應該的怪聲呼喝像流氓在戲館裏胡鬧有失體統</p>
<p>復旦隊是由他們的體育指導作領隊那體育指導常給人家稱作「怪物」那天他身上披着雨衣頭上戴着打鳥帽足上穿着長統黑皮靴面色是美洲印第安人的面色兩道眉永遠變鎖著像是很憂愁的樣子</p>
<p>其實他那時因為復旦占勝利心理正得意着呢</p>
<p>女子籃球停歇時他蹲在女球員前面做手勢教她們種種克敵的門檻遠看像是啞子跪着在求婚看客唏他旋轉向四面看看不笑也不罵回頭來依舊進行他的Lecture、</p>
<p>「彼得」面皮老有名不過做體育教員就非面皮老不可尤其是作女生體育指導員面皮老乃是一種不可缺少的條件比如我校的劉良面皮也著實不嫩那天他是作男子賽的計時員的往常Haf-tim終了吹呌子可是他異想天開放槍嚇得在他近旁的看客個個跳</p>
<p>男子賽先是中公勝的終於復旦轉敗爲勝造成二十對二十六之比</p>
<p>在球藝方面男子當然比女子高明多多不過美中也有不足有些球員接着球往往停足多時不前進亦不派司敵方又不上前去奪僅僅等着球放出來這樣「從容不逼」的玩雖然並不犯規卻失去精彩不少並且浪費時間怪不經濟這是我門外漢的批評是否有當尚希對於球類運動有研究的諸君指教</p>

<p>The General Assembly Rescheduled to Begin Tomorrow Morning</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>In Nanjing today, the People's Congress Presidium meeting, from 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM, decided to establish a Credentials Committee. It was also decided that the General Assembly would be moved to the morning of the 8th because a large number of personnel from various General Assembly agencies would need to be present, and it was feared that the afternoon of the 7th would be too rushed. Therefore, it was moved to the morning of the 8th. (Sixth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chen Lifu, one of those elected to the presidium at the preparatory meeting in Nanjing on the morning of the 6th, declined the position. Peng Jiqun may be appointed as a replacement. (Sixth Dispatch)</p>

He was notified this evening that the second preparatory meeting would be held at 9:00 AM tomorrow and the first General Assembly in the afternoon. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>The presidium held a meeting at 9:00 PM this afternoon, and all members were present. Yu Youren was elected chairman. It was decided that the preparatory meeting would continue at 9:00 AM on the 7th. In addition to reporting the election results, the date of the General Assembly was also decided. Regarding the selection of members for the Credentials Committee, it was decided that over forty people would be nominated from the representatives of each province to review and understand the situations in their respective provinces. A list has been drafted and will be submitted to the preparatory meeting on the 7th for approval before the organization is formed. Regarding the daily affairs of the presidium, it was decided to divide them into three groups of three people each to handle them in rotation. Chen Lifu resigned from his position on the presidium, but everyone urged him to stay. It was also decided that members of various review committees would be decided at the General Assembly. Ye Chucang was nominated as Secretary-General of the General Assembly. About thirty people from Mongolia, Tibet, the navy, and the railways, among others, were specially permitted to attend. Also, it was originally planned to hold the General Assembly immediately after the preparatory meeting on the 7th. However, the chairman decided that the formal General Assembly should be particularly solemn, so it was moved to the 8th. The rules for observers have been approved by the presidium and will be announced on the 7th. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Two Issues in the International Chamber of Commerce Meeting <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>There are two noteworthy issues at today's International Chamber of Commerce meeting. One is that the Chinese and Indian representatives have requested that the international silver conference be convened immediately. They believe that only a joint international effort can overcome the difficulties in the silver market. The United States is wholeheartedly hoping to develop trade in the Far East, but unless a fundamental solution to restoring the silver market is found, the purchasing power of silver-using countries cannot be increased, and commerce will have no prospect of development. American businessmen only know to pay attention to commerce without first seeking to stabilize the silver market for silver-using countries, which is a rather one-sided view. Although the speech of the Chinese representative won the praise of the audience at the time, a certain industrialist predicted that the efforts to stabilize the silver market would be fruitless. Furthermore, a certain metallurgical engineer predicted that the world's gold production would inevitably decrease significantly in the next ten years, indicating that there is no hope for an increase in the silver market. Therefore, the future of the silver conference is very concerning. The other is that the president of the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce spoke, requesting that all countries jointly investigate the Russian market and economy to create a basis for trade cooperation with Russia, viewing this move as a strategy to revitalize the economy. However, other representatives are concerned about the dumping of Soviet goods, saying that unless the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan is discussed, it will be difficult to save the world's commercial crisis. Therefore, the hope of the Russian and American presidents to cooperate in trade to revitalize the economy may not be realized. Recently, international conferences have been convened one after another to seek various forms of cooperation, which can be described as busy. However, no results have been seen, not only in military and political affairs, but also in commerce. This is truly not a sign of world peace.</p>

<p>Nanjing: After arriving in Nanjing, Chiang Zuobin immediately met with Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang to report on Sino-German diplomatic events. According to what Chiang told visitors: (1) After serving as ambassador to Germany for three years, I should return to the country to report on diplomatic events, as is customary for diplomats. Sino-German relations have become increasingly friendly recently, such as the recent organization of industrial groups from both countries, which is enough to promote the friendship between the two countries. After the Great War, Germany has made rapid progress in construction. There are about 1,500 Chinese residents in Germany, with students accounting for one-third and the rest in the business community. (2) During this trip, I took the opportunity to travel through Soviet Russia and felt that their hard work spirit in implementing the five-year economic plan was very shocking. Russia's policies are attracting the attention of countries worldwide because the socialism adopted by Russia conflicts greatly with the interests of capitalist countries. Therefore, some countries have adopted a blockade policy against Russia to undermine Soviet trade, focusing solely on exports and absolutely unwilling to import, which is likely to cause global panic. (3) During the Sino-Russian negotiations, I met with Representative Mo in Russia. Mo's diplomatic skills are highly competent. If Russia can be sincere, the future is promising. (6th dispatch)</p>

<p>Saving the Silver Market</p>

<p>Chinese and Indian Representatives</p>
<p>Strongly Advocate Convening a Silver Conference</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Associated Press): At today's International Chamber of Commerce Congress, the Chinese and Indian representatives both strongly advocated for the immediate convening of an international silver conference. The Chinese representatives were particularly active in the discussions. Representatives Guo (Bingwen) and Li both detailed the sharp decline in purchasing power of silver-using countries today and strongly advocated the necessity of convening an international silver conference, believing that the only solution to the silver market lies in international joint action. Representative Bei (Songsun) formally requested the national committees of the International Chamber of Commerce to participate in the international silver conference, saying that we must restore the world's confidence in silver, and only international action today can save the silver market. All three delivered extremely insightful speeches, moving the listeners and eliciting continuous applause. US Senator King said that the Chinese representatives were able to disclose the situation after the fall in silver prices to the audience with profound insights, which was convincing and gratifying. Renowned metallurgical engineer Han Mengte gave a speech guaranteeing that world gold production will greatly decrease in the next ten years, or will decrease to 30 percent. Some experts predict that it will decrease by 50 percent, and he also believes that his prediction is not without reason. British industrialist and financier Kodeshi, who resides in Shanghai, gave a speech advocating that China adopt the gold standard and the world strive to stabilize silver prices. If this is not done, world trade will not achieve any results, so he asked all countries to help China adopt the gold standard. Indian Chief Representative Bridge gave a speech supporting the convening of an international silver conference and stated that his personal opinion is to take immediate action to restore the silver market, because hundreds of millions of Eastern people are suffering severely after its fall.</p>
<p>Washington, 6th (National Press): US-Russia Chamber of Commerce President Cooper stated at the International Chamber of Commerce today that the goods sold to Soviet Russia by the world can reach at least 30 billion US dollars annually, so he asked all countries to jointly conduct an economic investigation of the Soviet Russian market as a basis for trade cooperation negotiations with the Russian government, and said that the Soviet Russian government welcomes this meeting. Although Cooper strongly advocated trade with Russia at the meeting, believing it to be an economic policy that shines on Russia, other representatives were discussing the dumping of Soviet Russian goods. Although this issue was not formally included in the agenda, many industrialists and businessmen believed it to be very important. Some representatives have indicated that it is difficult to save the success of the world commercial crisis without discussing the Soviet Russian five-year plan at the meeting.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Reuters): US Treasury Secretary Mellon told foreign bankers attending the International Chamber of Commerce Congress today that the solution to the current difficulties must be sought from personal initiative, not from industrial facilities being left to the government or other organizations. Prices must be revised and costs must be reduced. He believes that this goal can be achieved without reducing wages. The Treasury Secretary repeatedly stated that the United States does not support reducing debt款.</p>

<p>French Actions Are Worrying</p>
<p>Madrid, 5th (National Press): In the Tuan area of Spanish Moroccan territory, there have recently been incidents of foreign garrison soldiers colluding with locals to cause disturbances. Two hundred people have died and many more have been injured. Although it has now temporarily calmed down, the internal situation remains unstable. The Moroccan issue may soon become a tricky matter for the new republic, similar to the Catalan issue. The Moroccans have recently been restless and are being incited by White Russians. A latent crisis is very worrying and it is feared that once it erupts, France will use the excuse of endangering the French territory of Morocco to invade and occupy the disturbed area. The Spanish Cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the Moroccan issue and it is reported that it was decided to send reinforcements to Cueta to suppress the unrest.</p>

<p>Geneva, 5th (National Press): It has been officially notified that Spain will be represented by Foreign Minister Lerroux when the League of Nations Council meets this month. The League of Nations is very satisfied and attaches great importance to this matter because the Spanish representative is the official recorder of the Disarmament Council in his position. Currently, League of Nations Secretariat Disarmament Group Director Angeni has departed for Madrid to meet with Mr. Lerroux to discuss various disarmament matters. The location of the Disarmament Conference has not yet been determined. Spain has vigorously suggested Barcelona as the meeting place. The proposal is very promising because at least several countries agree to it in order to show goodwill towards the new Spanish Republic.</p>
<p>Geneva, 6th (National Press): The Secretariat of the League of Nations has received a proposal from Sweden that in the event of tension in the international situation, the governments concerned should do their best to strictly prohibit all political or newspaper propaganda to avoid the situation from becoming more tense, and that in peacetime, governments should widely promote peace and international understanding.</p>

<p>Lancashire Textile Industry Asks Government for Relief</p>
<p>London, 5th (Reuters): Eight thousand people in the Lancashire textile industry gathered at the Manchester Exchange market today to protest against India's rejection of British goods and the increase in import tariffs on cotton goods. A motion was passed, asking the government to actively strive to obtain a relief method. At the same time, according to news from Bombay, Modi, chairman of the Bombay Manufacturers' Association and a representative attending the Indian Round Table Conference, told a Reuters reporter that Lancashire lacks a clear understanding and seems unaware of the impact of the reduction in India's purchasing power. India will never give up its right to use tariffs and promote the movement of India's self-made cloth. It must be able to use tariffs in a sustained manner. Lancashire's good intentions and fair petitions can get the sympathy of many people in the Indian business community, but political pressure has no power to sell Lancashire goods, just as political boycotts have no power to defeat economic maxims.</p>

In addition, Russia’s participation this time was very active, and the bidding price reached two or three times that of the Japanese. If the Russians adopt such an active attitude, Japan will inevitably fall into a difficult situation next year, causing panic among business operators.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Zhang Jinghui Goes to the Capital to Assume Post as President of the Military Council <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>To Return to Harbin to Concurrently Hold Post After Taking Office</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence - Zhang Jinghui, the Chief Executive of the Eastern Provinces Special Region, was appointed President of the Military Council by the Central Government.  The official order was issued two months ago, but Zhang only departed southward on the evening of April 30th.  He will not stop along the way and is scheduled to arrive in the capital before the opening of the National Assembly to first take office as President of the Military Council, so that he can participate in the ceremonies when the National Assembly convenes.  He is scheduled to stay in the capital for one month and return to Harbin around early June.  Thereafter, he will concurrently hold the post of President remotely.  The reason why Zhang was not in a hurry to go to the capital was that the position of Chief Executive of the Eastern Provinces Special Region was also extremely important, and he was unwilling to travel far.  Until recently, the Northeast authorities indicated that even though Zhang was going to the capital to take office, he could return to Harbin to lead remotely after staying for a while.  Zhang then decided to depart southward.  The affairs of the Chief Executive's Office will be temporarily handled by Bao Lian, the Director of the Department of Political Affairs.  In case of important events, he will telegraph the capital for instructions.  It is also heard that the Northeast authorities will discuss with the Central Government the system of the Eastern Provinces Special Region.  If the provinces are reduced in size and the Special Region is changed into a province, or if it is completely abolished, Zhang Jinghui will also participate in this discussion after arriving in the capital. Therefore, this trip of Zhang's is of considerable importance. (May 1)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Hunan Disaster Victims to Implement Migration to the Northeast <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The First Batch Temporarily Set at 500 People</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence - Hunan Province is densely populated and has frequent disasters, resulting in unemployment for the four classes of people.  The refugees from Pingjiang and Liuyang who are now in the provincial capital and unable to return home still number in the tens of thousands.  Although all sectors are trying their best to raise funds for relief, it is difficult to reach everyone.  The Hunan authorities believe that passive giving is ultimately unsustainable, so they have decided to migrate people to the Northeast as a positive remedy.  They sent Cao Jihui to the Northeast for an on-the-ground investigation.  He believes that Hunan Camp in Yilan County, Jilin Province, is sparsely populated, with an average of less than one person per square mile.  If the surplus population of Hunan is used to fill the sparse population of the Northeast, the Eastern Provinces will not only reap the benefits of consolidating the borders, but Hunan Province will also alleviate the problem of overpopulation, and it can also develop land resources and expand people's livelihoods.  Commissioner Cao returned to Hunan yesterday and immediately submitted a report to the provincial government, which decided to designate the Hunan Camp reclamation area in Yilan County, Jilin as the Hunan immigrant area.  The first batch will temporarily move 500 people there, and the expenses are set at 50,000 yuan, which will be allocated from the relief funds.  A migration office will be set up under the Hunan Provincial Relief Association, and Cao Jihui will be appointed as a commissioner to oversee the migration.  A Hunan Migration Area Management Bureau will also be established in Hunan Camp in Yilan County, and Zhang Zuce will be appointed as a commissioner to handle matters related to the reception, registration, management, and protection of the settlers, the allocation of reclaimed land, and the autonomy of the reclaimed area.  The first group of settlers is limited to arriving in the reclaimed area before the end of June, and preparations are currently underway.  Yesterday, the Hunan Provincial Relief Association's Migration Office issued a notice to make all the key points of the migration widely known. (May 3)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Hebei Province to Levy Business Tax <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>To Offset Losses After Abolishing Likin</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence - Before the abolition of likin, the financial revenue of Hebei Province was about 24 million yuan per year.  In addition to providing more than 10 million yuan for government expenses, the remainder was allocated to military expenses.  However, after the implementation of likin abolition this year, revenue has been reduced by about 8 to 9 million yuan.  The military and government expenses have caused great panic.  Fortunately, the provincial treasury still had some surplus at the end of last year.  Government expenses were issued at 80%, which could barely support for a few months.  By the end of last month, the situation was already desperate.  Therefore, starting from the first of this month, orders have been given to all departments to implement staff reductions and salary cuts.  Recently, departments such as education, agriculture and mining, civil affairs, finance, and construction have cut one-third to one-half of their personnel in order to save money.  The monthly expenses of each department have been reduced from about 14,000 to 15,000 yuan to 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.  The provincial and municipal authorities had earlier proposed to quickly implement a business tax to offset the losses after the abolition of likin.  During the time when Zang Qifang was acting mayor of Tianjin, discussions were held on whether the province and city should handle it separately, but no agreement was reached.  Later, Zang left and Zhang Xueming was promoted to mayor.  Wang Shuchang, the chairman of the province, spent more than a month in Shenyang discussing the financial problems of the province.  If the business tax were handled separately by the province and city, then the commerce of Hebei would be concentrated in Tianjin, and the tax revenue in other places would be very small.  Only by merging the province and city could the provincial treasury be supplemented.  After repeated discussions with Deputy Commander Zhang, it was finally decided that the province and city would jointly handle it.  After Wang returned to Tianjin, he ordered Yao Hong, the Director of the Department of Finance, to actively proceed.  First, a Business Tax Preparatory Committee was established, and seven people were appointed as members: Yao Hong, Director of the Department of Finance, Zhang Xueming, Mayor, He Yufang, Director of the Department of Industry, Zhang Guochen, Director of the Bureau of Finance, Zhou Zhensheng, Secretary of the Municipal Government, Zhang Pintiming, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Liu Diou, a financial expert.  The collection regulations were passed by the preparatory meeting yesterday and submitted to the Central Government for record.  It is heard that the date of implementation is set to begin on June 1.

<h3 id="e81">The Tripitaka Sutra of Yexian County is Transported to Jinan for Preservation <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Previous Rumor of Burning Was Not Accurate</p>
<p>But A Portion Was Damaged</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - The Tripitaka Sutra of Hainan Temple in Yexian County, Shandong Province, was originally known as the complete copy in the country. In recent years, it has been lost due to repeated moves. A rumor has circulated a month ago that the sutra was burned by the Normal School lecture hall. The Education Department, therefore, specially sent Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library, to Yexian to investigate the truth. He learned that the rumor of burning was not accurate, but the loss was very severe. If it is not transported to Jinan for proper preservation, the famous and precious books will eventually be completely damaged. Therefore, 2,275 volumes of the complete ones, packed in eight boxes, and the broken ones, packed in eighteen burlap bags, were transported to the Jinan Library on April 23. Because they wanted to make it a complete set with the old ones, they are currently organizing the old shelves and compiling the catalog every day. The report submitted by Wang Xiantang to the Education Department is recorded below: "In the case of the order No. 1288 from your department, the Tripitaka Sutra of Hainan Temple in Yexian County was damaged, and I was ordered to cooperate with the county magistrate and the county supervisor of education to find a way to transport and preserve it. After receiving this order, I arrived in Yexian County on the 11th of this month and went to Hainan Temple with County Magistrate Ma Zhenfan and Supervisor Peng Rulin to investigate and discuss the transportation. County Magistrate Ma convened a meeting of all sectors and unanimously agreed to hand it over to Xiantang for preservation in the library. This Tripitaka Sutra is a Ming Dynasty version of the Sanskrit Sutra. During the Shunzhi period of the early Qing Dynasty, Zhang Duan, a scholar from Yexian, converted his family temple into Qingchan Temple, also known as Dabei Pavilion, in the northeast corner of the city. He purchased the entire Tripitaka Sutra and donated it to the temple. Last year, the army occupied the temple and did not know how to protect it, so it was arbitrarily damaged. Huang Da, the former county magistrate of Yexian, ordered people to sort out the debris and transport it to the current Hainan Temple building. Later, Hainan Temple was borrowed by the militia group. After the militia group left, in March of this year, the county magistrate ordered the Normal School lecture hall to move to Hainan Temple because there were no suitable rooms. At that time, the remaining Tripitaka Sutra had been moved from the upstairs and was in a mess. According to the Director of the County Education Bureau and the Director of the Normal School lecture hall, the sutras were scattered downstairs at that time, and the students were supervised to sort them out separately. Some of the complete ones were stored upstairs and hidden with boards. The rest of the broken and incomplete ones could not be sorted out and were piled in the bell tower of the temple. The four sides were also made of boards to cover them. The county decided to transport the sutra, so Xiantang immediately purchased wooden boxes and burlap bags the next day and went to the temple to open the panels and count them with the staff, teachers, and students. There were 2,275 complete volumes, all packed in boxes. The rest was all scrap paper that could not be counted, totaling eight large wooden boxes and eighteen burlap bags. He immediately compiled the numbers, affixed seals, and obtained a passport from the county government. On the 13th, he used a large cart to transport them to Weixian and handed them over to Yuelai Transportation Company. They were transported to Jinan and arrived at the library on the 23rd of this month. In addition to sorting them out and putting them on the shelves, I am also compiling a catalog. I should report the details of the handling process in detail for your review and record." (May 4)</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Loss of Books and Its Aftermath <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiantang's Findings</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - In the past year, the problem of the Haiyuan Pavilion library of the Yang family in Liaocheng has attracted the attention of the people of the country. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education have repeatedly sent letters to the Shandong Provincial Government to transfer orders to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Education to investigate the matter. However, Wang Xiantang, the director of the Shandong Provincial Library, has also been involved in this matter from beginning to end. Due to his responsibilities, he has been thinking about including the treasures and secrets of the Haiyuan Pavilion into the library for proper preservation, so that it can be immortalized along with the Magpie Mountain and the Ming Lake. Therefore, he has put a lot of effort into collecting the books of the Haiyuan Pavilion. In the winter of the 18th year of the Republic, Wang was ordered to go to Liaocheng Haiyuan Pavilion to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. After returning, he wrote a book called "The Past and Present of the Haiyuan Pavilion Library of the Yang Family in Liaocheng" for the public to review. Since then, booksellers in Pingjin and Jinan have been running back and forth to Liaocheng and Jinan to buy the books of the Haiyuan Pavilion. Because Wang is good at appraising bronzes, stone carvings, calligraphy and painting, and versions of books, he must have Wang review them whenever he gets something. Therefore, Wang, although he did not buy the books sold by the Haiyuan Pavilion, he has seen most of them. Recently, Wang wrote another article entitled "The Loss of Books and the Aftermath of the Haiyuan Pavilion Library" based on his years of experience. It describes in detail the number and value of the books lost in the Haiyuan Pavilion. Before the article is published, it is first recorded here to awaken the attention of the people of the country. The article is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Haiyuan Pavilion Library of the Yang family in Liaocheng has suffered repeated banditry in recent years. The previous losses have been briefly described in the previous booklet, "The Past and Present of the Haiyuan Pavilion Library of the Yang Family in Liaocheng." The reports at that time were all based on actual surveys, and the facts were up to the time the survey was completed. In the year since the publication of this booklet, the Yang family's collection of books has continued to suffer from banditry and losses have increased. Now, based on the results of the investigation, I will describe them in detail below. After I returned to Jinan from the survey, the government authorities once made a resolution on the aftercare measures and were in the process of handling it. Bandits rose up near the area and the roads were blocked. Then, the bandits occupied Liaocheng and set up camp in the Haiyuan Pavilion. After the bandits left, there were troops who were recruited and reorganized into the city. This came and went continuously, and it was impossible to describe their names in detail. However, it is known that Wang Guanjun was the one who seized the most books. After the bandits occupied Liaocheng, the government could not negotiate with the Yang family about the library. Then, the war broke out in various places and the political situation changed. The provincial government moved to Qingdao and was in a state of turmoil, so there was no time to deal with this matter. When the overall situation was settled and the provincial government moved to Jinan, the bandits in the area were also gradually suppressed, but the secret books and rare books of the Haiyuan Pavilion had been swept away. The best of the Yang family's rare books were transported to Tianjin earlier. The losses this time were all the books recorded in my booklet and ordinary Ming and Qing versions. When the bandits occupied Liaocheng, they often sold the Yang family's books. The buyers gave prices at will, without paying much attention to them. Sometimes they were cut up to wrap things, cook food, or taken out as pillows. But this was still less than 1% of the collection because the Yang family had too many books. When Wang Guanjun entered the city with his newly recruited troops, he knew that the Yang family's collection of books was beautiful, rich, and valuable, so he invited a book and antique expert from Tianjin, known as Ninth Master, to Liaocheng to thoroughly inspect the rare books and all valuable books, inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings. At the same time, in the name of harboring bandits, he thoroughly searched the residents inside and outside the city. All private books, calligraphy, and antiques were also swept away. It is also heard that the eight volumes of the Song edition Xianchun Lin'an Zhi of the Yang family were taken into a civilian's house by bandits to be used as a pillow. Wang's army searched for it, fearing that they would be implicated, so they burned the Lin'an Zhi and chopped up the book box for cooking. When I went to investigate, I only saw two volumes of Lin'an Zhi. The book box still existed. It is quite incomprehensible that four more volumes have suddenly been added this time. In short, the Haiyuan Pavilion Library suffered the only major catastrophe in the past this time. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Established Disaster Relief Association <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Disaster Relief Committee for the five counties of Huangchuan, Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, and Shangcheng in Henan has announced its establishment. Yesterday, a telegram was sent saying that the five counties of Huangchuan, Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, and Shangcheng are located on the border and have been repeatedly harassed by bandits. The cunning were coerced into becoming bandits, and the honest were trampled on. Piles of white bones were left unburied, and the flesh and blood were in a mess, with a foul smell. Women, children, and the elderly were killed by the bandits, which was worse than the disaster of Chuang and Xian. Fortunately, our Central Government quickly dispatched a large army to painfully suppress the Red bandits and save the people from fire and water. However, after the soldiers passed by, the refugees were scattered everywhere and should be appeased and rescued to ensure good aftercare. Comrades and others, in response to environmental needs, have specially united with enthusiastic comrades to organize the Disaster Relief Association for the Disaster Areas of Huangchuan, Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, and Shangcheng. A meeting was held in Huangchuan in April to establish the association. Seventeen members were elected to be responsible for carrying out the work. We hope that kind people from all over the world will remember the refugees and give generously to save the people from disaster or widely publicize it to arouse sympathy. The disaster victims in the border area are very grateful. We specially send this telegram to report. Members of the Standing Committee of the Disaster Relief Association for the Disaster Areas of the Five Counties of Huangchuan, Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, and Shangcheng, Duan Jianmin, Han An, Liu Lianfu, etc., kowtow in gratitude.</p>

<p>Negotiations on Debt Between Wuxian and Wuxing - The Qianzhuang in Wuxing County owed the Qianzhuang in Suzhou more than 200,000 yuan. After repeated demands were ignored, the Suzhou Qianye Guild published a statement declaring the severance of relations with the Wuxing Qianye. Subsequently, the Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce took the responsibility to mediate and agreed on four measures for the Wuxing Qianye to be responsible for the settlement. They sent a letter to the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce to solicit opinions. The Suzhou Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of executives and supervisors on the afternoon of the 6th and decided to send a letter to the Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the progress and to collect a list of debts from the Qianye in this county and copy it to the Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce for joint handling. The Qianye creditors of this county will elect representatives to jointly supervise the Wuxing County Chamber of Commerce to effectively settle the matter.</p>
<p>Small Disturbance Among Wooden Loom Workers - A small number of workers in the wooden loom silk weaving industry in Suzhou went on strike because the capitalists refused to pay the reduced wages as usual. Fearing that the strike would escalate, the union petitioned the county government to convene representatives of both labor and capital in Suzhou to mediate as soon as possible. The county government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to stop it and has set the 8th as the date for the mediation meeting. The capitalists of the industry held a meeting on the evening of the 6th to discuss everything. It is also heard that the strike was not initiated by the workers themselves, but someone was strongly persuading the workers to stop working in the Loumen area. However, only a few dozen people have joined.</p>
<p>Small Steamer and Cargo Ship Robbed at the Same Time - The Herong small steamer of the Tongli Shipping Company, which runs daily between Dangkou Town, which borders Suzhou and Wuxi, and Baqian in Kunshan, was carrying more than 30 passengers at 4:00 PM on the 4th when it suddenly encountered five bandit ships in Xinkai River Township, which borders Kunshan and Changshu. The bandit ships surrounded the steamer, and more than ten bandits on board, all speaking the Chaohu dialect, took out box cannons and fired at the steamer. The glass windows and cabin doors of the steamer were destroyed. The deputy captain, Tao Ada, and Tao Zi were both slightly injured by stray bullets. The steamer stopped and let the bandits board and rob them. The bandits robbed passengers of silver, clothes, and other items worth about 500 yuan. At the same time, a cargo ship of the Shanghai Laogongmao Shipping Company, which was heading to Wuxi, also passed by and was robbed, suffering greater losses. The bandit ships then fled towards Yangcheng Lake. When the bandits were robbing, Pang Diancai, the county magistrate of Kunshan, was returning to his hometown in Changshu for something. When the ship passed by the place and heard gunfire in front, he returned to Dongtangshi in Changshu to report to the third squad of the 13th water police team, which in turn reported to the 13th team headquarters. That night, the team leader, Yang Qingjiu, led the team to pursue the bandits. When they arrived at the Xiaojing Yang Santai Temple area of Yangcheng Lake, they searched but did not find the bandits. They returned to Changshu on the 6th. The Herong small steamer is currently still docked at Xiaohengjing.</p>

<p>The Main Culprit in the Murder Case Was Apprehended - Lu Deguan, a bookkeeper from the family of Liu Kuangfeng, a villager in Liujiaqiao Township, District 8, went to Yin Zenrong's place in Yinxiang Lane on August 13 of the 17th year of the Republic to search for a thousand marks due to a dispute over land. He suddenly disappeared and has not been heard from since. Recently, Zhu Meiji, the head of the militia regiment stationed in Huaishang City, ordered the militiamen to maintain order because Houtou Mountain in the city holds a large incense festival every year on the 18th day of the third month of the lunar calendar. The other day, Yao Kangying, a militiaman of the regiment, was sipping tea at a teahouse near Zha Jiaqiao when he caught sight of a stack of bamboo hats resting under the eaves across the street. The man carrying the stack did not resemble a farmer buying and selling, and his expression was flustered and suspicious. He asked the people around him and learned that this man was Wang Amei, who had been wanted with a reward of 20 yuan during the tenure of Qin, the former county magistrate, for being the leader of the Red bandits who had repeatedly committed murders and riots. He immediately stepped forward, arrested the bandit Wang, and took him to the regiment. Zhu, the head of the security, interrogated him and confessed that Du Xiao, Pan Fulang, and several unidentified people from Jiangyin were accomplices in the murder of Lu Deguan and were currently hiding somewhere. Zhu, according to the confession, immediately sent Captain Jiang Xinfu to arrest them at their addresses. Du and Pan were arrested together. Under questioning, they revealed that Lu Deguan's body was buried in the northeastern corner of Ma Tree under 451 illustrations.</p>

<p>Inside the wheat field of Jinghewan, that is, together with the 7th District Office and the captain of the 2nd Company of the Police Brigade stationed there, they went to excavate yesterday and found a skeleton, and immediately ordered the regiment commander Du Changshou to take care of it properly and reported to the County Court to request that personnel be sent to the countryside to examine it for verification.</p>
<p>A Kidnapping Case Occurred in Huaishang City - Chen Fengyi, 64 years old, and his wife, Yan, 61 years old, residents of Guanwuqiao Tulili in the 463th area, 7th district (Huaishang City), were from a well-to-do family, but were sterile and adopted Sun Honggen, the son of Sun Mou from Sun Lane, Hexi, Bashiqiao, Tianshang City, as their stepson 20 years ago, and also adopted a stepdaughter named Dajie, while Honggen has been idle and wandering, specializing in associating with idlers in recent years. Recently, Fengyi went abroad for 300 yuan and severed the relationship between him and Honggen. Honggen refused and beat Fengyi into an injury. Fengyi came to the city to file a lawsuit in the County Court for unfilial piety, which has not been concluded yet. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM the other day, more than 30 thugs resembling bandits suddenly came to the Chen family, each holding fierce weapons, and rushed in and looted wantonly for two hours before carrying the stolen goods out the door and tying up the two Yan women and hiring a boat from Xi Chunquan, a local villager, to transport the meat tickets. After checking the loss, it was about 2,000 yuan. Yesterday, the principal, Lu Fengyi, borrowed the names of Chen Xihou, the deputy township chief, Chen Xixian, and Zhang Baoquan, the head of the picture, to come to the city to file a complaint with the County Security Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the County Court for investigation.</p>
<p>The Condition of Mulberry, Soybean, and Wheat in the Four Rural Areas - The silkworms came out late this spring. The native species have been sleeping for the second time, and the foreign species have started to pupate. Some have just come out. There has been a lot of rain recently, and it is not suitable for the silkworms to eat wet leaves. Because the market price was very low last year, the market price this year is also depressed, about one yuan per dan, and no one is interested. Due to continuous rain and snow last winter and heavy spring snow this spring, plowing and fertilization were delayed. In mid-April, there were several days of heavy frost, which caused the ears of wheat to turn white during fruiting, reducing the harvest. The mulberry buds were also damaged. This was unexpected by the farmers.

The vacant position was entrusted to Li Qing, a staff officer, but it is heard that Staff Officer Li firmly refused to take the position and only agreed to act as a temporary replacement, so suitable talents still need to be found to take the position.</p>
<p>The Governor's Office Ordered Investigation of the Miao Qingyou Case - According to Zhuang Yuanxi and others in Fu'an East, Dongtai County, the Governor's Office for Pacification, complained about Miao Qingyou's illegal acts, especially the boldness to collude with bandits in the name of the office to oppress the people, which is a disregard for the law.

<p>A local militia member shielded bandits and embezzled stolen goods. Xu Guoxuan, a farmer from the fourth village of the fifth district under this county, reported last month that a flat-bottomed boat had been stolen by bandits. He immediately appealed to the county government to investigate and arrest the perpetrators. Subsequently, Sun Changtai, a local militia member from the same village, apprehended Ge Daju, one of the thieves, who confessed that the boat was in Xiajiaji. The victim was immediately notified to retrieve it. However, halfway there, the militia member suddenly demanded that Xu Guoxuan pay him dozens of dollars, otherwise, he would not be able to recover the boat. Xu now accuses the militia member of releasing the thief and then embezzling and extorting money. He has filed a complaint with the county government requesting the detention and interrogation of Sun Changtai.</p>

<p>Xu Fubo Arrested</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, Deng Jingming, the head of the Investigation Team of the Garrison Headquarters, received a tip that a pseudo-military organization was operating in areas such as Beile Road in the French Concession. Deng had already heard rumors about this a few days prior. After dispatching officers for a secret investigation, it was confirmed that the information was credible, and it matched the tip received on that day. Without alarming the suspects, Deng dispatched investigators Yang Fengqi, Xu Pengfei, Wang Bin, Yao Ding, and others, together with Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Police, to raid No. 19 Laotianxiang Lane, Beile Road, at 2:00 AM. They successfully dismantled a pseudo-Naval Defense Guerrilla Headquarters. The team apprehended Zheng Duo, a pseudo-captain; Yin Zhanyuan, an adjutant; Xie Heqing, a quartermaster; Ma Zhibing, a special agent; Shao Lisheng, a cook; and Xie Atang, the sixth person. Two suitcases and a wicker basket of incriminating evidence were seized, including a pseudo-carved wooden seal, uniforms, armed belts, letters of appointment, and official documents. Xu Fubo, a pseudo-commander, was arrested at the Datong Apartment on Malang Road, and Shu Bin, a pseudo-chief of staff, was arrested at Jingyi Lane on the same road. The suspects and the evidence were temporarily detained at the French Concession Police Station. It is reported that the team has submitted a request to the Garrison Headquarters to transfer the suspects for interrogation. According to investigations, Xu Fubo and others, relying on their false title of commander, issued appointments indiscriminately, sold official positions, and swindled money from gullible individuals seeking official positions. It is said that a certain Mr. Li was defrauded of several thousand gold pieces in exchange for a worthless letter of appointment.

<p>Sends Qian Chengxu to Tianjin for Investigation</p>
<p>Domestic factories rely heavily on Kailuan coal. Recently, a dispute suddenly arose between Kailuan Mines and the Beining Railway Bureau, causing a shortage of coal on the market, which has affected industrial production and the livelihood of workers. The impact is not limited to the influx of Japanese coal into China. The China Industrial Federation has received numerous letters and telegrams from members in various regions requesting negotiations with the Kailuan Shanghai office. The office and users are also facing legal responsibility due to the lack of coal to distribute. The dispute has lasted for over a month without a resolution. Factories are losing approximately $100,000 per day. The cause of the dispute between Kailuan Mines and the Beining Railway Bureau remains a secret, and the true situation remains unclear to the outside world. Recently, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the China Industrial Federation have negotiated, believing that the continued dispute is detrimental to both industry and commerce. As Dr. Qian Chengxu was invited to Tianjin and Beijing to lecture on China's industrial construction, he was publicly recommended to resolve the coal transportation issues. Qian will travel from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 7th to discuss the matter with the government and is expected to depart for Beijing around the 10th.</p>

<p>Agency Established, China Merchants Bureau to Replace British Firm Butterfield &amp; Swire</p>
<p>Initially, the China Merchants Bureau planned to establish a branch to replace the British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire's shipping service to Weihaiwei. However, the application for 4,000 yuan in start-up funds from the Ministry of Communications was not approved, so it was decided to establish an agency in Weihaiwei to reduce expenses. Operations will expand into a branch once the business becomes profitable. The Business Department chiefs, Shen and Feng, drafted agency regulations and signed contracts with the agents, and ships will soon be dispatched.</p>
<p>Operating Expenses Determined</p>
<p>Weihaiwei has no Chinese ships operating there. This is the first time a ship will be dispatched to the region, and the Bureau's Shen Zhongyi, Feng Yichen, He Molin, and others have repeatedly deliberated on operational matters. To encourage cargo transport and development, it is planned to allocate a 9.5% commission for regular expenses. Additionally, a reward of twenty-five taels of silver will be given for each round-trip import and export voyage. This will greatly increase revenue and effectively incentivize business.</p>
<p>Three Ships Assigned to the Route, Preparations Long Underway, Service to Begin Soon</p>
<p>The Bureau has decided to assign three ships from the Beiyang route, namely Xin Feng, Xin Ming, and Yu Shun, to travel to Weihaiwei six times a month. It is expected that the service will begin after the new general manager takes office.</p>

<p>Shipping Association Reorganized</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association, an organization of over seventy shipping companies, handles disputes within the shipping industry and deals with business-related conflicts. It has been quite effective since its establishment. The Ministry of Communications has revised the regulations for the organization of shipping associations and issued them to Shanghai yesterday, ordering the association to reorganize according to the new regulations. The association has followed this order and set up a preparatory office on the third floor of No. 10 Guangdong Road. The new articles of association stipulate that the shipping association regulations promulgated on December 14, 16, have been repealed, and the association will be reorganized in accordance with the regulations for industrial and commercial associations and people's organizations. Membership of the shipping association is stipulated to be (1) those engaged in shipping and transportation, (2) those engaged in commercial vessel leasing, and (3) those engaged in commercial shipbuilding. If there are seven or more branch offices in one location, an association may be formed, but no more than two associations may be established in the same location. The tasks of the association are also clearly defined as (1) researching improvements in shipping, (2) protecting the interests of the shipping industry, (3) mediating disputes and arbitration in the shipping industry, (4) forwarding official documents and reports relating to shipping, (5) preparing statistics, etc. After receiving this order yesterday, the Shanghai Shipping Association dissolved the original association and reorganized it as a preparatory office in accordance with the new articles of association.</p>
<p>Quickly Establish Marine Insurance</p>
<p>The Shanghai shipping industry is planning to establish a marine insurance company. In late March, the eight major shipping companies in the city agreed to establish the company, but it has not yet been established due to unpaid shares. Now, ship accidents are occurring frequently, and disputes are arising over the loss and compensation of sailors. The initiators have held subsequent meetings, calling for the urgent establishment of the company. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to all shipping companies stating that the original proposal to establish marine insurance was to provide shipowners with a means of self-help and to protect sailors from unexpected dangers. Although the initiators identified the shares on March 28, the company has not yet been established. Given the recent accidents involving the Dachang and Daji ships, the urgency of this insurance is even more apparent. Yesterday, the original initiators held a meeting to discuss the matter, and the following measures were decided: The identified shares should be paid from May 15th to 31st. Yu Qiaqing was appointed as the head of the preparatory committee, and Chen Ganqing and Shen Zhongyi were appointed as members of the preparatory committee. The shares should be deposited with the Ningbo Commercial Bank for collection to facilitate early establishment.</p>

<p>To Exempt Export Taxes on Silk, Chinese Tea, Embroidery, etc.</p>
<p>To Clearly Define Exemption Scope in Business Tax Law</p>
<p>Requests Early Enactment of Money Shop Law to Benefit Commerce</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, the representative of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and industrial organizations to the National Assembly, took a special train to Nanjing on the 3rd and stayed at the Central Hotel. In addition to reporting to the National Assembly Office the day before yesterday, Wang also went to the Legislative Yuan in the afternoon to present detailed arguments regarding the requests to exempt export taxes on silk, Chinese tea, embroidery, etc., to clearly define exemption standards when enacting the business tax law, and to enact the Money Shop Law. It is reported that the members of the Legislative Yuan expressed their willingness to accommodate these requests as much as possible. The following is the original text of Wang's submission:</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted: I, Yansong, am a representative to the National Assembly elected by the Shanghai business community. Before my departure, I was entrusted by 180 trade associations in the city to alleviate the suffering of merchants and people. How could I dare to remain silent about the ardent hopes of the merchants and the weight of my responsibilities? Now, I humbly present the points of request from the Shanghai merchants and people to the Legislative Yuan: (1) Please exempt export taxes on silk, Chinese tea, embroidery, etc. I heard that the export tax law is still under consideration by the Legislative Yuan. It was previously reported that the Ministry of Finance plans to abolish the regular customs duties within fifty li after increasing export taxes, while the regular customs duties collect about 6 million yuan annually. According to the Ministry of Finance's original proposal for the new export tax law, it can increase revenue to 20 million yuan annually. Even according to the Legislative Yuan's initial review, it can collect up to 16 million yuan, which is higher than the old tax law. However, our country is a country with a trade deficit, and foreign trade has long suffered from depression. The government has the responsibility to encourage and promote it. Silk and Chinese tea, which are the most important exports of our country, have also had their overseas sales taken away by others. In addition, the tariff barriers of various countries are heavily levied, which may lead to prohibition. I earnestly request that the Legislative Yuan, when reviewing the new tax law this time, exempt all export taxes on silk, Chinese tea, embroidery, etc., which should be expanded in overseas sales, to show protection. (2) Please clearly define the exemption standards in the business tax law. The business tax law has been approved by the Legislative Yuan, and members Chen Changheng and Shi Weihuan are drafting it. How can we relieve the suffering of merchants and people and avoid repeating the mistakes of likin? The members of the committee have given deep consideration and mature thought to this issue. However, the business tax is a universal tax. If we are not careful, its harassment will be even worse than likin. The opinions of various industries on the business tax have been submitted by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations in letters and telegrams at any time. The main points are: (1) In accordance with the resolution on abolishing likin, the tax rate should not exceed two per thousand. (2) The scope of luxury businesses and businesses that should be banned from taxation should be clearly defined. We should also confirm that luxury businesses are not the same as luxury goods. (3) Agents who do not directly sell goods should be exempt from tax. (4)</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Please continue to exempt business tax on goods that were originally exempt from likin, such as native cloth. (5) Businesses engaged in foreign trade should be exempted from tax or have their taxes reduced. (6) Determine the principle of one tax per item. No taxes or levies may be collected in any name other than the business tax. (7) In accordance with the resolution of the Central Political Council, provinces may not start collecting taxes before the Legislative Yuan has reviewed and approved them. If there are any increases in tax rates in the future, they should also be approved by the Legislative Yuan before they can be implemented. I earnestly request that the above seven items be clearly stipulated in the business tax law for compliance. (3) Please enact the Money Shop Law to benefit commerce. The banking and money industries are both the hub of all industries in our country. Banks mainly provide loans with mortgages, but in terms of the current commercial relationship, the money industry is even more common and important. If we must force money shops to use banking laws, then it will inevitably affect commerce.

<h3 id="e115">Requests Maintenance of Original Special Tax <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Exempts Customs Duty on Foil Products</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the imposition of both special business tax and customs duty on foil products contradicts the principle that special taxes, once paid in full, should be valid throughout the country. Yesterday, the chamber telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again, requesting the maintenance of the original special tax and exemption from further customs duty on foil products. The original telegram stated: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: This association is requesting the correction of the overlapping taxation of special business tax on foil products. On April 30th, we received your Ministry's telegram in response, stating that the business tax is levied on the act of business and not on goods. Regardless of whether any goods have paid the business tax or not, they must pay customs duty in accordance with the regulations when transported through customs. The case of foil products is the same. The request for exemption is difficult to approve, etc. The association has reviewed the telegram sent on the 15th, which is divided into three points. The first point is that although the original text of the Zhejiang Department of Finance's report states that it still follows the old rules, extracting twelve and a half percent, the new rules extract fifteen percent, which is inconsistent with the old rules. The second point is that after the special tax is paid in full, it is valid throughout the country, while this time it is limited to the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which is also inconsistent with the old rules. The current approval from your Ministry does not mention these two points, and we request that the original case be investigated and corrected. The third point is that the current approval states that the business tax is levied on the act of business and not on goods. Regardless of whether any goods have paid the business tax or not, they must pay customs duty in accordance with the regulations when transported through customs, etc. The association believes that the special business tax on foil products implemented in Zhejiang Province is a disguised special tax that is not consistent with the principles of business tax. For example, the tax rate is levied as a percentage instead of per thousand, and the tax amount is not directly paid by the taxpayer to the competent authority, but is contracted out to others. All of these are in violation of the outline and supplementary measures. The main point is that the business tax is levied on the act of business and not on goods, while the special business tax on foil products currently collected in Zhejiang Province is levied once for each batch of goods sold. It is also found that the tax schedule is based on the thickness of the goods. There are five checkpoints along the route from Shaoxing to Shanghai. How can this be said to not be a tax on goods? The provincial government is trying to excuse itself with sophistry. Since all the taxation methods in the province are based on the old special tax regulations, the old rule that customs duty is no longer paid once the tax has been paid should be fully applied. Otherwise, other industries will have their burdens reduced by abolishing likin, while this industry alone will have its tax burden increased by abolishing likin. This is unfair in terms of government orders. Based on the above reasons, we are sending another telegram to your ministry to ask for your review and approval to maintain the original special tax on foil products and to exempt them from further customs duty to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and facilitate public convenience. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully."</p>

<p>No Additional Business Tax on Those Who Have Paid Brokerage Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Tea Trade Association yesterday, stating: "We received your letter on April 28th, asking for an explanation on whether the brokerage tax is within the scope of special taxes, and stating that tea businesses have meager profits and cannot be taxed at two per thousand like shops, but can only be taxed at five jiao per thousand yuan. The answers are as follows: (1) The brokerage tax has long been used as provincial revenue and is managed by the Provincial Education Fund Management Office. It is not within the scope of central special taxes. (2) Tea businesses that have paid brokerage tax are different from tea shops. In accordance with Article 11 of the Supplementary Measures to the Business Tax promulgated by the Ministry, the brokerage tax will be renamed the business tax in the current first transitional step, and the tax rate will remain the same as the original brokerage tax."</p>

<h3 id="e119">Crackdown on Counterfeit National Product Trademarks <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Attached is the original opinion</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday issued a directive to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that it was ordered to comply with the matter. The Ministry of Industry's directive, Industry Character No. 2934, stated that the members of the Industry and Commerce Conference, Chen Yaoyuan, etc., proposed that tax-free ports should be banned from altering the decoration and trademarks of foreign products to pass them off as local products and sell them in the mainland to evade export taxes and maintain the local manufacturing industry. After the conference passed the resolution, the Ministry believed that unscrupulous merchants impersonating national product trademarks should be banned according to law. However, the case did not state the facts clearly, so it was impossible to stop it. The Trademark Bureau was ordered to submit its opinions for verification. Now, the Trademark Bureau's report and attached opinion were received by the Ministry. The letter is divided into three categories, totaling ten items. The third item of the second category and the second and third items of the third category are all related to various commercial organizations. It is found that unscrupulous merchants are cunning and have many tricks. It is difficult for those who are not familiar with the local situation to know where they are hiding. It is appropriate to copy and distribute the original opinion letter to let them know that if unscrupulous elements are used by foreign merchants, they are allowed to submit evidence and request investigation to prevent impersonation. This order, etc. A copy of the original opinion letter is attached. Upon receiving this, the original opinion letter shall be copied and distributed to the association to instruct all trade associations to comply with this order. Now, the original opinion letter is attached as follows: (A) Cases of discovering foreign goods impersonating national product trademarks that have been rejected: (1) The Butterfly China Positive Trademark and its joint trademark of the Japanese Asahi Match Co., Ltd. were ordered to be changed to the Guohua trademark because the submitted design had prominent Chinese characters before being reviewed and approved separately. (2) The Laifu trademark of the Japanese Nissin Match Co., Ltd. was rejected because there were two characters "Guohuo" (national product) in the upper corners of the design, and registration was not allowed. (B) Proposed opinions on cracking down on foreign goods impersonating national product trademarks: (1) When applying for registration of trademarks and designs with explicit expressions such as "Guohuo" (national product), "Guochan" (domestic product), "Zhonghua Zhizao" (Made in China), or implicit meanings of national products such as "Resist Foreign Goods and Recover Rights," the bureau should carefully examine them and strictly reject them. (2) When submitting commodity samples and decorations to the bureau for trademark cases, the bureau should pay attention to detailed inspection at any time. If it is found outside the decision that foreign goods are impersonating national products by using words or are suspected of impersonating, it should be reported to the Ministry to instruct the competent authorities to investigate and handle it. (3) Continue to print national product trademarks for identification, but the printing of national product trademarks is based on whether the applicant's nationality is Chinese. Whether the products used are purely domestic-made should be investigated separately by various business organizations and competent national product authorities. (4) If there is a foreign product counterfeiting a trademark and impersonating a national product, the circumstances are more serious than ordinary trademark counterfeiting and should be transferred to the court for strict punishment. (C) Views on cracking down on foreign goods impersonating national products: (1) It is advisable to start from the customs. When encountering local goods for transshipment, a detailed inspection must be carried out to avoid confusion. (2) Businessmen must know about large quantities of goods being transported to other ports. Local goods factories and trade associations should investigate at any time whether there are unscrupulous elements being used by foreign merchants. If they are indeed national products, they should be certified by the trade association. (3) Investigate the manufacturing capacity of each factory producing products. If the output exceeds its capacity, it is inevitable that foreign goods are being repackaged. Strict investigation and crackdown should be carried out. (4) Strictly stipulate the penalty for foreign goods impersonating national products.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a letter was sent to the National Products Exhibition Hall in this port</p>
<p>In recent years, China has been under economic pressure from foreigners, resulting in backward production and declining markets. Therefore, overseas Chinese merchants believe that it is necessary to actively revitalize industry and commerce and advocate national products. Yesterday, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Honolulu, USA, and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Singapore, etc., sent letters to the National Products Exhibition Hall in this port to inquire about the procedures for collecting national products. The original letter stated that "The cheapness of silver and the expensiveness of gold is the best time to promote national products. Your museum seeks domestic products for social reference on the one hand, and strives to promote national awareness on the other hand. Your painstaking efforts are enough to celebrate the future of national products. We believe that promoting national products should pay special attention to international trade. Overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce can also hold national product exhibitions to arouse foreigners' interest in using Chinese goods. Our chamber has long had this ambition, but we need to know what procedures to use to collect national products easily. Your museum has extensive research experience, and we hope you can show us the way so that we can start holding them."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Chen Wenlin's Talk on Aviation in Fujian Province <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen is scheduled to return to Fujian by boat today</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Wenlin, Director of the Xiamen Naval Aviation Training Center, returned to Shanghai after attending the aviation conference in Beijing and is currently staying at sea. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency met Mr. Chen at his residence and asked about the aviation situation in Fujian Province. According to him, Fujian Province has never had an aviation team. All existing teams were created by the Navy. There were originally three agencies: (1) the Naval Aviation Office, (2) the Mawei Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office, and (3) the Naval Aviation Training Center, which I presided over. Later, the first two agencies moved to Shanghai one after another, so the only one currently in Fujian is the Training Center, which has about ten training aircraft under its jurisdiction. In addition to the daily training of students, during the campaign against Lu (Xingbang), Fujian Province lacked air force, so at that time, the aircraft of our department assisted the army to work on the front line for a time. But it has now been pacified. There are a small number of Red bandits harassing the western part of Fujian, so sometimes the aircraft of our department are also transferred to suppress them. Director Zhang (Huichang) met me in Beijing and he did have a slight illness, but I don't know which hospital he went to in Shanghai. This time, I attended the aviation conference, firstly as a representative of the Fujian Provincial Naval Aviation, and secondly because the conference asked me to serve as an expert. Therefore, I came to Beijing and now I need to report the process of the conference back to Fujian, so I have decided to take the boat tomorrow (today) at noon.</p>

<p>The Guangxin Seven Counties Association in Shanghai telegraphs the Beijing-Jiangxi authorities, "Chairman Jiang of the capital, Director He of Nanchang, the Red bandits led by Fang Shao ravaged the Guangxin counties, a tragic situation. Fortunately, the central government ordered the dispatch of the Ruan and Xu Divisions to clear the Red bandits in eastern Jiangxi, and Fang Shao could hide slightly. Farmers are spending the spring plowing. Recently, I heard that the Tang Brigade returned to Zhejiang, which led to the resurgence of the bandit forces, capturing Xiaoyushan and brutally killing people. The bandit forces in Yigui and Guizhou counties are even more rampant, and the bandits in Shixi Village in Qian County are also rampant. The public groups and refugees of various counties are appealing and sending letters and telegrams, requesting the central government to withdraw its order and to send reinforcements to clear the Red bandits and stabilize the area as soon as possible. Xu Xun and others living at sea miss their hometown and have no home to return to. Please telegraph the Tang Brigade to delay leaving Jiangxi to complete the task of suppressing bandits and to send reinforcements to achieve the effect of assistance. Guangxin is fortunate, the party and the country are fortunate. The Standing Committee of the Guangxin Seven Counties Association in Shanghai, Xu Xun, Guo Tong, Liu Liangmo, salute."</p>

<p>Various committees in the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department have Chinese members participating, but the Library Committee and the Music Team Committee are entirely composed of foreign members. When the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association held its first meeting, Committee Member Chu Huiseng proposed to contact the Public Works Department. After discussion, it was decided to hand it over to the Chinese directors for handling. On April 16, the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department decided to add one Chinese member to the Music Team Committee and one Chinese member recommended by the Chinese directors to the Library Committee. It is heard that the Chinese directors and Chinese members held their second meeting yesterday and decided to appoint Mr. Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the Commercial Press and Director of the Oriental Library, as a member of the Public Works Department Library Committee, and Mr. Wang has agreed. Mr. Huang Shiyou, a music expert currently working at the National Music Academy, was appointed as a member of the Public Works Department Music Team Committee, and his opinion is currently being sought.</p>

<p>Elected Executive and Supervisory Standing Committee</p>
<p>The Zhabei District Fire Fighting Association in this city was initiated and organized in the third year of the Republic of China and has achieved some success in local fire affairs. Now, due to the active renovation of municipal construction, it is ordered to be unified and reorganized to seek the safety of citizens. Therefore, the Zhabei sections of the Fire Fighting Association decided to select 15 people familiar with the local situation from the original directors to form an organization together with the representatives of each section, and recommend Mr. Wang Binyan and others to temporarily take over and sort things out. It has been going on for many days and various sorting matters are now nearing completion. A founding ceremony was held at the Lianhua General Association the other day. Committee members Wang Xiaolai, Chen Songyuan, Wang Binyan, Chen Weihan, Sun Meitang, Mo Meiqing, Li Guangzhen, and dozens of directors and representatives of each section attended the meeting as scheduled. First, the chairman reported on the progress of the sorting affairs.

<h3 id="e127">Fisheries Guidance Institute Established Yesterday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Fisheries Guidance Institute has been in preparation for a long time and was officially established yesterday (the 6th). A reporter from the Industry and Commerce Society visited Mr. Zhou Jianyin, the director of the institute, at the old site of the former Finance Ministry's Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Affairs Bureau in Taili Lane, Laoximen. When asked about the purpose of the establishment of the guidance institute, he replied that Shanghai is located in the Yangtze River Basin and a coastal hub. It is not only the hub of the fisheries of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, but also the only base for the new-style fisheries in the country. The position in the great fisheries is extremely important. Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau has always been determined to improve fisheries. Considering that the rise and fall of fisheries in this city is of great concern to the national economy and people's livelihood, he approved the Municipal Government to prepare to establish a fisheries guidance institute in August last year as a specialized agency to improve fisheries in this city. Later, due to funding issues, it could not be established for a time. In November, the Social Affairs Bureau, considering that foreign encroachment on fishing was becoming more and more serious and that domestic fisheries were becoming more and more depressed, continued to actively prepare for the establishment of the guidance institute on the one hand, and initiated the organization of the Fisheries Improvement Propaganda Association together with the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining. It held an expanded propaganda week at the Shanghai Civil Middle School last month. The details have been reported in various newspapers. At that time, I (Director Zhou said himself) was commissioned to prepare for the work, and Mr. Wang Defa was commissioned to serve as a technician to assist in everything. It was not until today that it was officially established. Everything is still in its infancy. I hope that the public opinion will provide assistance from time to time so that it can proceed smoothly and the result will be twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Great Fortune Wheel Collision Case <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Report from Ping An Company</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency stated that the Great Fortune Wheel of the Dahua Company collided with the Great Fortune Wheel of the Ping An Company outside Wusongkou, and the Great Fortune Wheel immediately sank. The situation has been reported in previous reports. It is now learned that the Ping An Company, the owner of the Great Fortune Wheel, sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Association, stating (excerpt above) that the Great Fortune Wheel of our company set sail from the third wharf in Hudong, Shanghai at 6:50 pm on April 14 to Dinghai, Shipu, Haimen and other ports. The night was dark and the sky was clear. Since the ship was driven by Captain Ge Ashi, it was 8:20 pm when the ship passed the Lisnore buoy. The captain then corrected the direction and proceeded along the downstream channel towards the Block House buoy. Then, the second mate and Jiangbei leader Bei Shifu drove the ship. The captain stayed by his side for a moment and saw no ships on the sea. He left the pilot house for about eight minutes. The second mate saw the masthead light and the green light on the side of a ship in front of him. The ship was coming from a position three characters off the starboard bow of the Great Fortune Wheel. The two ships did not shout back. At that time, the Great Fortune Wheel was in the downstream channel and was sailing according to the regulations. Although the Great Fortune Wheel was three characters off the starboard bow, its bow was not directly facing the Great Fortune Wheel. The two ships could pass each other without any risk of magnetic collision. Unexpectedly, the Great Fortune Wheel suddenly pulled four loud horn signals in a row. As soon as the captain of the Great Fortune Wheel heard the horn signal, he immediately went to the deck and entered the pilot house. He still saw the green light of the Great Fortune Wheel coming towards him. When the two ships were only a few ship lengths apart, the Great Fortune Wheel suddenly changed direction and passed over the bow of the Great Fortune Wheel to the right. The captain of the Great Fortune Wheel knew that something was wrong and immediately pulled the whistle three times and stopped the engine and opened the full speed reverse engine. But it still could not avoid the collision. Then, the middle of the port side of the Great Fortune Wheel collided with the bow of the Great Fortune Wheel. After the accident, the Great Fortune Wheel checked whether the ship was in danger of sinking. It was found that there was no major problem for the time being. It approached the Great Fortune Wheel to carry out rescue and transferred all the passengers and crew of the Great Fortune Wheel. After inquiring and confirming that no one was left on the ship, the Great Fortune Wheel began to drive back to Wusong and anchor. A customs fireboat came and the captain and second mate of the Great Fortune Wheel and the captain of the Great Fortune Wheel took the customs ship to the Wusong Customs to report the collision. It was found that the accident was entirely caused by the fault of the driver of the Great Fortune Wheel. The Great Fortune Wheel of our company suffered a great loss as a result. We have informed the Dahua Company to demand compensation. According to the company's reply, not only did they not admit liability for compensation, but they wanted our company to compensate them. The dispute between the two parties has not been resolved. Although the sinking of the Great Fortune Wheel was caused by its own fault, the ship was insured by the China-America Water and Fire Insurance Company, so there should be no loss in reality. Our company is currently investigating the conclusive evidence and can prove the fault of the Great Fortune Wheel. The evidence will be collected and submitted for approval to the Ministry of Communications for record (excerpt below).</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese-Foreign Yizhen Society received a telegram from the Sixian County Disaster Relief Committee yesterday, petitioning for relief, stating that "Sixian County is located on the border of Anhui Province, where the land is barren and the people are poor. For many years, the bandit forces have been rampant and the local area is in ruins. Last year, there was continuous rain and the seedlings were destroyed, and the harvest from the highlands was not enough to cover the cost of seeds. Since the beginning of spring, there has been no rain for two months, resulting in ten houses and nine empty houses. People have no way to beg and no way to borrow. Those who are crying and waiting to die are countless. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. If we do not seek relief urgently, hundreds of thousands of lives will be doomed to death. We can only plead with all charitable organizations to sympathize with the people's lives, open up the virtue of good life, and send staff to Sixian with funds to provide relief so that the disaster victims of Sixian County can turn death into life. We are extremely grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e136">Xu Yabo is Still Detained <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Confrontation with Li Wenjun</p>
<p>Li Claims Xu is Indeed His Teacher</p>
<p>The Court Must Conduct Further Investigation</p>
<p>Three Women Have Been Released</p>
<p>After Xu Tianxiong, the notorious bandit of Taihu Lake, also known as Taibao Ashu, was captured and executed by Xu Pucheng, the district chief of the First District of the Water Police, his numerous followers dispersed in all directions, making it difficult to prevent them from regrouping and causing disturbances. Therefore, relentless efforts were made to apprehend them. On the morning of the 26th of last month, at 5:00 AM, Chief Xu discovered that Li Wenjun, a subordinate of Taibao Ashu involved in communist activities, and his teacher Xu Yabo (formerly the district chief of the First District of the Water Police) were hiding at No. 96 Annam Road and No. 332 Duofuli, Foch Road, in the Public Concession. He then collaborated with the Jing'an Temple police to arrest Li and Xu, along with Lu Fugen, Qian Moqu, Qian Zhangshi, Qian Xiangrong, Li Weishi, Qian Weirong, Lu Gushi, Wu Qianshi, Jin Linshi, Lu Lishi, Cao Feishi, Chen Asan, and others, and brought them to the Special District Court for a joint interrogation. Except for Chen Wenjun, who was taken back by Chief Xu in court, Qian Moqu, Qian Zhangshi, Qian Xiangrong, and Qian Weirong were released because they were not involved. The remaining individuals were detained separately. This was reported in this newspaper yesterday morning. Judge Ge Zhitan continued the interrogation in the Second Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that a witness, Wang Wendao, was present and requested to be questioned. Wang Wendao testified that he lived at No. 332 Duofuli and cohabited with Xu Yabo, also known as Gongshu. Because both he and Xu rented the house from the landlord, the lease was in the name of Wang Gongshu. The Water Police, represented by lawyer Liu Zuwang, requested a transfer and presented various pieces of evidence, claiming that Xu was involved in the robbery of Xu Baiming, a resident near Songjiang Xin Zhuang, on December 12th of last year. Xu Yabo hired three lawyers, Fan Gang, Pan Chenge, and Yuan Xilian, to defend him, arguing that the defendant resided in the concession and should be tried by the court in the defendant's location according to the law. Xu Yabo testified that he previously lived at No. 32 Huanlong Road in the French Concession. Around January of this year, he received a pistol thrown from outside, followed by a threatening letter from Taibao Ashu, which stated that when he was the chief of the First District of the Water Police, many of their followers were arrested and executed. Now that he was still in Shanghai, he should quickly seek death or spend some money to save the souls of the dead. If he agreed to pay, he should write the words "Full Earth Red" on white paper and paste it on the door. After receiving the letter, he thought it was extremely dangerous, so he reported it to the French police. The police ordered him to follow the instructions in the letter to facilitate the arrest, but he did not think it was appropriate and decided to move. He then cohabited with Wang Wendao in Duofuli. Since resigning as the chief of the First District of the Water Police in the 16th year of the Republic, he had been working in the military and political circles. Later, he founded the World Moral Society, but it closed down in the 19th year of the Republic due to a loss of tens of thousands of gold. He had been unemployed ever since. Li Wenjun was also brought to court by Chief Xu. Li testified that Xu Yabo, the defendant in this case, was the Xu Yabo he had previously mentioned. He became Xu's student in December of last year, and Taibao Ashu became Xu's student in January of this year. He and Xu only had a teacher-student relationship, and Xu was not involved in his actions. At this point, the part of the interrogation concerning Xu Yabo ended. The other defendants were then questioned. Chief Xu Pucheng testified that the defendant Lu Fugen was listed in the bandit register, Li Weishi was Lu's wife, originally named Zhang Aiwen, who was in charge of food. Wu Qianshi, also known as Chen Gushi, nicknamed Sister Mei, was the wife of the executed bandit Tang Yixin. Cao Feishi, Ashu's mother, and Chen Asan, Ashu's younger brother, should also be temporarily detained because Ashu had many firearms hidden in wasteland tombs that had not been recovered. The rest of the people were not involved. Judge Ge reviewed the testimonies and ordered Xu Yabo and others to be detained separately for further investigation at a later date. Lu Gushi, Jin Dushi, and Lu Lishi were released.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Detective Liang Chengli is Accused <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<h3 id="e138">of Robbing a Huge Amount of Morphine <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Worth More Than 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Detectives Speak with Conviction</p>
<p>Liang Chengyu, from Shandong, has been working as a detective in the Old Gate Police Station for many years. Last year, he was promoted to the head of the Second Chinese Detective Team and transferred to the General Inspection Office of the General Police Station. He resided at No. 756 and a half, Dafangli, South Chengdu Road. At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Chief Inspector Yok of the Inspection Office, Chief Detective Lu Liankui, and Detective Liu Shaokui suddenly escorted Detective Liang to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court, accusing him of conspiring with others on the night of April 28th at 11:00 PM to rob Li Liansheng of morphine worth more than 50,000 yuan at No. 439 Male Li, Chongqing Road, using armed violence and coercion, violating Article 348 of the Criminal Law. The defendant Liang Chengyu hired three lawyers, Ye Fukan, Yuan Yang'an, and Tan Xinzhen. Li Liansheng also hired lawyer Eson to defend him. First, Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, presented the case, stating that on the morning of April 28th, at around 7:00 AM, seven robbers, two armed with pistols, broke into a company at No. 1 Wenderli, Jiale Road, and robbed morphine worth 50,000 yuan. They took the stolen goods to the Public Concession, first placing them on Dagu Road, then moving them to Danshui Road, and finally to Li Liansheng's house at No. 439 Old Male Li, Chongqing Road. Li was one of the seven robbers. At around 11:00 PM that night, six robbers, two armed with pistols, broke into Li's house and took all the morphine. The defendant Liang Chengyu was one of the six robbers and distributed the opium between 1:00 AM and 6:00 AM on the 29th, so the stolen goods have not been found. Li reported to the police that he was robbed by Liang and his gang. Inspector Yok ordered Li to identify the robbers and pointed out the defendant from six detectives. The next day, Li's mistress, Zhang Ashi, went to the police station, and the detective ordered six or seven detectives to remove their coats and badges and mix the defendant among them. Zhang first pointed out another detective, No. 110, but then said it was a mistake and pointed out the defendant. However, the defendant denied it at the police station. Chief Inspector Yok also submitted a report to the court explaining the situation, and his testimony was similar to that of lawyer Zhang. Li Liansheng testified that he was a local, 25 years old, and worked in hardware. He lived on the upper floor of the living room at No. 439 Old Male Li, Chongqing Road. On the morning of the 28th of last month, at 7:30 AM, he and Xu Gengen (who was arrested by the French police), Wang Zilian, Mr. Zhang, and others went to Jiale Road and robbed four boxes of morphine worth more than 50,000 yuan. Wang initiated this matter, and Zhang had two pistols. After the incident, Zhang took the pistols and four packages of morphine to the sixth house in Dafangli, Chengdu Road, which was Detective Liang's house. The robbed morphine was first transported to Dagu Road by car. Fearing that the driver would leak the information, it was moved to Danshui Road. Soon after, it was moved to Zhou's house opposite the racecourse. Because Zhou's house was small, it was moved to his house, where he guarded it alone. At 11:00 PM that night, six robbers entered through the back door and went straight to the living room and his bedroom. Detective Liang, Zhu Mapi, and a large man with a sturdy body each held a pistol, forcing him to hand over the keys to open the boxes, shouting that Xu Gengen had been arrested by the French police and demanding that he hand over the goods immediately, promising to give him 30 yuan first and another 3,000 yuan after the goods were sold. Detective Liang was wearing a brown robe and a copper helmet and came with Westerners. He first took away a large leather suitcase containing the morphine. As they were about to move the remaining boxes, they were stopped by the patrol officer at the gate because it was late at night. They changed their plan and took him and his mistress Zhang Ashi to Room 9 of the Jingsheng Inn in Jingshengli behind the Far East Hotel to supervise and discuss. At dawn, around 5:00 AM, they sent two people to watch him and two people accompanied his mistress Zhang Ashi home to open the remaining three boxes, pack them into two shoe baskets, and hire a car to transport them away. Later, he met a detective surnamed Wang, told him what happened, and was taken to the Chief Inspector's office to report and identified the defendant. The woman Zhang Ashi, from Yangzhou, 30 years old, testified that Li Liansheng was her husband and that her testimony was mostly the same as Li's, so it was omitted. The defendant Liang Chengyu testified that he knew nothing about this matter and had taken leave on April 28th and was not working. He did not know Zhu Mapi and the large man. On that day, he went to the French Concession with his friend Dong Lanting and could call Dong to testify. He had arrested Li Liansheng, also known as Fang Liansheng, for his involvement in the kidnapping of Li Huiqing at Gamsdong Road in the French Concession and searched Li's house on Chongqing Road for guns but found nothing. He was now being falsely accused. Finally, lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated to the court that when the defendant was detained, he told Chief Inspector Yok that if he could find the morphine, would he not be taken to court? Yok did not allow this because this statement was concerned with his reputation. Lawyer Zhang then asked the defendant if this had happened, but the defendant denied it. At this point, Judge Ge Zhitan believed that the case required further investigation and additional witnesses, so he ordered the defendant Liang Chengyu to be detained for questioning again on the afternoon of the 15th of this month and allowed Li Liansheng and Zhang Ashi to be detained.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Ye and Chen's Reconciliation is Unlikely <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Out-of-Court Mediation Failed</p>
<p>Yesterday's Continued Trial, Each Fully Explaining Their Case</p>
<p>The lawsuit between Ye Zhongfang and Chen Xiuzhen was previously heard twice by Judge Xiao Xiefei, who ordered both parties to mediate out of court. As the mediation failed, the hearing was continued yesterday. At 2:30 PM, Judge Xiao opened the third court hearing. Both the plaintiff, defendant, and lawyers were present as scheduled. Ye Zhongfang was no longer wearing a Western suit as before but had changed into a Chinese-style gown. First, Ye's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, stated that the defendant hoped Chen Xiuzhen would return to the Ye family, but the other party was unwilling and only wanted money, so reconciliation was difficult and the court should make a decision. Judge Xiao then questioned the plaintiff, Chen Yan, asking if her daughter could live with Ye Zhongfang again. She replied that they used to live together harmoniously, but now it was impossible. The judge then turned to Chen Xiuzhen and asked if she had lived with Ye for two years and could continue to live with him. Xiuzhen replied that he (referring to Zhongfang) had sent her back to her mother's house last time. Asked when she started living with Ye, she replied December 22nd of the year before last. Asked if her mother knew, she replied no at first. Asked why she had posted a newspaper notice, she replied that Ye had asked lawyer Zhang Ding to do it. Asked if it was her intention, she replied that he had thought of it for her. Asked if the notice included the phrase "separate from her mother and have marital autonomy," she replied that he had taught her to say that. She was only seventeen the year before last, and if she did not agree, he would force her to smoke opium and often threaten her with sulfuric acid and pistols. She was afraid of him, so she followed his instructions to post the notice. Asked why she was afraid of him, she replied that she had to go to the dance hall at night and return home late, fearing harm. Asked how long Ye lived in her house, she replied that their spare room was rented to him, but he did not come to stay at night. Asked why he rented it if he did not stay, she replied that she did not know. Asked if she had told her mother when she left with Ye on December 22nd the year before last, she replied that she had not. Asked what Ye said they were going to do, she replied eat snacks. Asked where her mother was, she replied that they were supposed to meet at the train station. Asked why she did not go to the train station, she replied that he did not allow her to return. Asked if she was willing to follow Ye, she replied that he wanted her, but she was afraid of him. Asked why she was not afraid of her mother, she replied that her mother did not have sulfuric acid and pistols. Asked how long she lived in Ye's house, she replied about five or six months. Asked if her mother had looked for her, she replied that she knew she had been taken away by Ye, so she did not look for her. Asked if she knew that her mother had reported it to the police, she replied that she did not know. The judge then questioned the defendant, Ye Zhongfang, asking what he had to say in response to the plaintiff's accusation that he had abducted her daughter. Ye replied that he had said everything last time. In short, her mother had ordered her daughter to accompany him because he was drunk that day and could not return home, so her mother allowed him to stay overnight and ordered her daughter to sleep with him. This kind of behavior should not be considered seduction. Asked if he had any evidence to refute the plaintiff's accusation of abduction, he replied that he had gone to buy furniture with the daughter when he rented the room, so it was not abduction. Asked if he knew that the daughter was not of age and had no autonomy, he replied that she had taught him everything. Asked if it was true that the mother had allowed it, but now she objected, he replied that if she said he had abducted her, why had she not accused him earlier? They had mediated with each other between August and September of last year, and he had agreed to pay 1,500 yuan to resolve the matter, but he did not have the money at the time, which led to today's situation. Asked about the newspaper notice, Chen Xiuzhen testified that it was Ye's idea. He replied that anyone who had lost their conscience could say anything, but the lawyer representing the publication of the notice was well-versed in the law and would not have been so rash. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer, Xue Jiaqi, stated that the court believed that the mother's testimony that she had reported the case to the police required further investigation, so he stated that the mother had reported it to the Loujiawan Police Station in the French Concession, which could be investigated to clarify the matter. The judge then asked Chen Yan about the rental situation. She replied that Ye had rented the living room upstairs in their house for 22 yuan a month. Ye's friends were all men, and she did not go to his room, but Ye did not live in that room at night. She did not know about her daughter's relationship with him at first. This year, because he beat her daughter, the mother sent her daughter back home. Lawyer Jiang then cross-examined the mother, but she was unwilling to answer many questions or gave irrelevant answers. Lawyer Jiang then proposed questions for the judge to ask. The judge announced that the case would be postponed and continued on the 20th of this month. Both parties then left.</p>

<p>Because Zou Demands a Huge Amount of Alimony</p>
<p>Trial Can Only Begin After Supplemental Litigation Costs are Paid</p>
<p>Economic Doctor Tang Huixuan's wife, Zou Aizhen, filed a lawsuit in the local court, accusing her husband of humiliation, requesting a divorce, and demanding a huge amount of alimony. It was scheduled to be tried yesterday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the judge in charge of this case is Judge Ding. Because Zou Aizhen did not pay the alimony litigation costs, only Zou was summoned and ordered to pay the supplemental costs before setting a new date for the trial. However, bailiff Huang Guocheng held the summons for Zou Aizhen but could not find her and submitted a report to cancel the summons. However, the cases scheduled for trial by the court have been announced at the bulletin board and published in the newspaper for two days. Zou Aizhen read the newspaper yesterday and rushed to the court in the afternoon to report. The judge told her that she had to pay the supplemental litigation costs before the trial could begin, and she then left the court.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Spring Cold Affects Silkworm Rearing <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Hatching is Delayed and Development is Poor</p>
<p>According to an investigation by local silk merchants, this spring, due to the cold weather around Qingming, silkworm farmers have been greatly affected. Recently, farmers in Hangyu and Linping have reported that their silkworms died from the cold twice, before and after hatching. The last ones that were raised were also difficult to thrive because they hatched later. Moreover, Chinese farmers do not know how to improve their breeding grounds and feeding methods, and the quality of silk is deteriorating day by day. It is predicted that this year's silkworm cocoon harvest will be difficult to be abundant.</p>

<p>Seven Crew Members Missing</p>
<p>One Person Drifts to Safety</p>
<p>The northern sandboat Chen Wantai loaded a large amount of soybean cakes and groceries from Taihuangdao and sailed to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 5th (yesterday), at about 4:00 PM, it sailed to the Tongsha waters outside the harbor. A hurricane broke out, and the captain was careless and ran aground on a reef, causing the bottom of the boat to crack and sink immediately. There were eight crew members on board, all of whom fell into the water. Seven of them are missing. One crew member named Zou Sixi was lucky enough to grab a plank when the boat sank. He drifted with the waves all night and drifted to the Sanjia Shui waters at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning. He was spotted by an ice-fresh fishing boat, rescued, and taken to Wusong. The crew member arrived in Shanghai and took a car to report to the company.</p>

<p>The Cholera Prevention and Injection Propaganda Committee, jointly organized by the municipal party and government agencies, held its first meeting the day before yesterday. More than ten committee members from the Municipal Party Department, Society, Public Security, Education, Public Works, and Health Bureau, including Shen Gao, Chen Ming, and Chen Lengseng, were present. Chairman Shen Gao resolved (1) to designate May 11th as Cholera Prevention Propaganda Day.

<h3 id="e148">Appeal to Landlord Shanshan Hall <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The tenants of Shangyifang in the French Concession's Baxianqiao have appealed to the landlord, Shanshan Hall, for relief, as the landlord Shangyi Company rented land to build houses and arbitrarily increased rents. They previously requested a rent reduction but received no satisfactory response. Therefore, they prepared a letter to the landlord, Shanshan Hall, requesting relief. The letter reads: Respectfully, we have investigated that your esteemed hall has many properties in Baxianqiao and other places in the French Concession. The rents have always been very low, and the people are very grateful. Your esteemed hall embraces universal love and has always provided guidance and rescue to people, which has a vast and altruistic intent. We believe that you will provide relief to our oppressed tenants. We will now state the main points: Shangyifang, west of the Baxianqiao vegetable market, was originally rented by poor vendors. Last spring, your esteemed hall contracted with Shangyi Company to renovate and sublet the area, arbitrarily changing the name of the lane to Shangyifang and privately collecting tens of thousands of taels in rental fees. The monthly rent is five or six times higher than before. When the tenants paid the deposit, they hoped that the market would flourish and business would prosper, so they would temporarily endure the pain. Now, a new road has been opened north of the vegetable market, named Manyixing Road, but few pedestrians pass through this road. Moreover, business in the vegetable market has also greatly decreased compared to before. Therefore, the decline in business in Shangyifang is equal to that of the vegetable market. The tenants, seeing this situation, fear that it will become increasingly difficult to support themselves. Therefore, they requested Shangyi Company to reduce the rent and return the small rent to show consideration. However, Shangyi Company arbitrarily transferred the management rights to the Chinese Business Company in order to shirk responsibility. We believe that the land ownership belongs entirely to your esteemed hall. Now, Shangyi Company's actions violate the French Consul General's ban on subletting. We request your esteemed hall to conduct a detailed investigation and order the company to automatically reduce rents and return the small rents to appease the public and protect your reputation (omitted below). This is a request to Master Moss of Shanshan Hall.</p>

<p>Red Cross Funds Relief for Shaanxi and Gansu</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Red Cross recently received a telegram from Yang Hucheng, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, stating that Shaanxi Province has suffered three years of drought, with people dying everywhere. The tragedy is unprecedented. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee resolved to issue 8 million yuan in public bonds to aid the disaster victims, which was celebrated by everyone, hoping for rebirth. However, several months have passed and it has not been implemented. Hope is in sight, but the need for relief is even more urgent. After repeated appeals from all parties, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek fortunately approved the issuance of 500,000 yuan, which can temporarily alleviate the urgent need, but it is still a drop in the bucket. Recently, we received a telegram from our provincial relief committee's representative in Beijing, Meng Faqi, stating that there were rumors that 300,000 yuan of the aforementioned allocation would be reallocated to the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia. We were shocked and horrified to hear this, because just as the supply of food runs out and the disaster situation becomes more serious, if relief is not provided immediately, the entire remaining population of Shaanxi will have no chance of survival. In addition to directly telegraphing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to order the original amount to be issued in order to maintain credibility, we respectfully telegraph you, pleading for your compassion for the heavy disaster in Shaanxi, and immediately telegraph the central government to investigate whether there is any agreement on the aforementioned reallocation and immediately cancel it to ensure that it is implemented to the end. We will be eternally grateful for your kindness. This is an urgent telegram. Sincerely, Yang Hucheng, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government.</p>
<p>The Gansu Branch of the Chinese Red Cross recently received a joint report from Huang Bingyi and Wu Jun, the heads of the Dangtu branch, Cai Junchuan and Shi Qingting, the heads of the Dangtu Caishi Buddhist Association, Yang Chucai, the former magistrate of Zhengning County in Gansu, and Yang Bingchen, the current principal of the First Middle School of Gansu, stating that Gansu is suffering from three disasters of heaven, earth, and man, which are actually worse than those in Shaanxi and Henan. Mr. Yang and others have been in Gansu for many years and have witnessed the suffering. Because there are very few people from Gansu traveling to Beijing and Shanghai, they cannot promote it as much as possible. Therefore, they have described the tragic situation they have seen and heard and prepared a report at their own expense, which has been forwarded by the Dangtu Red Cross branch. It is now disclosed here to clarify the true situation of the disaster in Gansu and to jointly plan for relief. The original text is divided into three items: (A) Drought: Gansu has suffered a drought for seventeen years, with hail disasters. The droughts in the eighteenth and nineteenth years were particularly severe. According to letters from friends in Gansu, there was no rain in October, and both the summer and autumn seasons in the nineteenth year yielded no harvest. In addition, the military food supply has been provided to the Northwest Army for many years, which is like adding salt to the wound. Two months ago, the price of grain in Lanzhou, the provincial capital, rose to 14 yuan per dou for wheat (the Gansu dou is large, one dou equals nine Su dou), 9 yuan per dou for millet seeds, and 10 yuan and more per dou for yellow rice. Recently, the price of wheat has risen to 23 or 24 yuan per dou, and about 30 yuan per 100 jin of wheat flour. The prices of other grains have also increased. Therefore, there are starving people everywhere, and corpses are everywhere. In Huining and Dingxi counties, people are eating human flesh, as reported in the Xin Shen and Shen Xin newspapers last year. According to reports from relief workers and people concerned, from the 17th year to the end of January of the 20th year, more than 2.3 million people died from freezing and starvation. It can be said to be a tragedy. (B) Earthquake: The earthquake in Longdong and Longnan counties in Gansu in the tenth year was unprecedented in the past hundred years. Cracks in the ground and landslides buried countless people and animals. According to calculations from Haiyuan, Qingshui, Zhengrong, Guyuan, and Longde counties, more than 30,000 people were buried. In total, it is estimated that more than 150,000 people were killed in the earthquake in various counties, with a property loss of more than 7 million yuan. In the sixteenth year, there was another major earthquake in Hexi, Wuwei, Pingfan, Gulang, Zhenfan, Yongchang, and other counties in Gansu. The houses in Wuwei Dongguan were destroyed and turned into flat ground. The houses and city walls in Gulang County all collapsed, and the county magistrate and prison officers were buried. After the earthquake in Wuwei, there was a flood that drowned more than 1,000 people. This is an unprecedented disaster that is unique to all provinces. (C) Man-made Disaster: After Feng Yuxiang's army entered Gansu in the fifteenth year, it incited a rebellion by the Gansu army led by Zhang Zhaojia and Huang Degui, which was not quelled until the sixteenth year. Although the number of deaths was not very high, the loss of property and the supply of grain were significant. Since the seventeenth year, Ma Zhongying and Ma Tingxian's rebellion has affected the overall situation, and there has been fighting between soldiers and bandits and revenge killings between Hui and Han people. Daohe, Didao, Ningding, Zhenfan, Pingfan, and other counties are the places where the Hui army has been active, burning and killing at will, turning them into scorched earth. Last year, 3,000 Han people were killed by Ma Tingxian's Hui army in Tianshui County, and the loss of property goes without saying. My nephew, Bingchen, recently returned to Suzhou from Gansu and described the disaster in detail, with tears in his eyes. Chu Cai has been in Gansu since the first year of Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, serving four terms until he left Zhengning County in June of the seventeenth year and returned to his hometown, and he often communicates with people in Gansu, so he knows the situation in Gansu. Now, reading the newspapers, he has repeatedly seen reports of urgent relief efforts in Henan and Shaanxi, while Gansu is secondary. However, he does not know that the droughts, earthquakes, and man-made disasters in Gansu have come one after another and are unique to the country. The disaster is actually worse than those in Shaanxi and Henan. However, there are very few people from Gansu traveling to Beijing and Shanghai, so they cannot promote it as much as possible. Moreover, the roads are rugged, and bandits are rampant, so philanthropists are unwilling to go to investigate in person, which has resulted in the fact that thousands of people are dying in Gansu every day, which is the most tragic and unfair thing. Chu Cai humbly follows the Prime Minister's legacy and holds the goals of equality and the people's livelihood and has been in Gansu for many years and has witnessed the suffering, so he cannot help but plead for the people of Gansu. He earnestly implores your association to show universal compassion, order appropriate personnel to quickly bring huge sums of money to save the innocent victims, and this will be boundless merit. Cai has been a vegetarian for many years and will never lie. I sincerely hope that you will consider it and be grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Jishi Society's Relief Efforts in Various Locations <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Liu'an Jishi Society has already remitted 15,000 yuan for disaster relief in Liu'an, Northern Anhui, specifically for disaster victims who have fled to the city. This was previously reported. Recently, we received a document brought to the society by Zhang Junze Pu, director of the Liu'an relief office of the society, and Cheng Jiyisheng and Gui Junbingji, representatives of the disaster relief association in the southwest disaster area of the county. The document stated: "We are unfortunate to have suffered continuous disasters. The southwest area has been severely affected. Xishan, a tea and ramie producing area, was brutally ravaged by the bandit Bai Laowu, Li Laomo, etc. in the 17th year of the Republic of China, and then by the Red bandits in the 18th year. It is still occupied by the Red bandits. Hundreds of thousands of lives are in extreme danger, with tens of thousands dead and the living on the verge of extinction. Our association, facing imminent disaster, has no time to save the dying. Therefore, we have sent representatives to detail the disaster situation, requesting additional relief funds to save these more than 100,000 dying victims, so that they can survive. We will be endlessly grateful for your great compassion." The two representatives, Cheng and Gui, also described the tragic situation in person, with tears in their voices. However, the society is currently focusing on disaster relief in heavily affected areas such as Shaanxi, Henan, and Liaoning provinces. Furthermore, telegrams requesting relief from Chaoyang and other places in Rehe are pouring in like snowflakes. Those in charge of charity are finding it extremely difficult at this time. We hope that enthusiastic comrades at home and abroad will contribute generously to help save the situation.</p>
<p>The China Jishi Society of Mianchi recently received a report from Feng Junxuefen, also known as Yangshan, director of the society's Mianchi, Henan relief office. Xuefen reported that he left Shanghai on the 20th and arrived in Xu on the morning of the 21st. He then took the Longhai train and a handcart to Luoyang. Xuefen went to Kaifeng to meet Chairman Liu of the provincial government and Chairman Zhang of the relief association. Upon checking the register of disaster victims in the Kaifeng shelter, he found that there were more than 4,000 disaster victims from Mianchi County alone. He learned that although there was a Chinese and foreign charity organization running a porridge kitchen in the urban area of Mianchi, it was limited to 500 porridge eaters in each of the five districts (east, west, south, north, and central), totaling 2,500. After Xuefen arrived in Mianchi, he consulted with the county porridge kitchen and added 2,700 more names to the list. He subsidized the Kaifeng porridge kitchen with 1,000 yuan and the Mianchi porridge kitchen with 1,000 yuan, doing his best. Mianchi has suffered from three years of drought, compounded by the ravages of soldiers and bandits. Last year's war inflicted the most severe damage on the county. The suffering is the worst in Henan Province. The original population of 160,000 to 170,000 has been reduced by half due to flight. The people have no food to sustain their lives, and the officials sigh in helplessness. The land is barren, and there is no hope for the wheat harvest. The future is long, and the situation is extremely tragic. Xuefen and others are currently searching for maps and planning to survey the area. Once finalized, they will set off. Such an extreme and severe disaster cannot be addressed by the originally planned 30,000 yuan relief fund. Please consider the disaster situation and increase relief efforts. The society is currently facing urgent disaster relief needs, with countless problems and a desire to help but an inability to do so. They have already borrowed from Siming and other banks. Now, according to reports, the disaster in Mian is so severe that they must find ways to raise more funds. There is no shortage of enthusiastic philanthropists at home and abroad who will generously contribute to save the situation.</p>

<p>To Prevent Impersonation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Stamp Tax Office, fearing that some people outside are impersonating salesmen to solicit money under the pretext of inspection, has issued a notice urging all businesses to pay attention. The original text is as follows: "Notice: All salesmen of this office wear badges and carry identification cards during working hours to identify themselves. Shanghai is a place where good and bad people live together. It is difficult to guarantee that unscrupulous people will not impersonate salesmen of this office and solicit money from stores under the pretext of inspection. Therefore, we issue this notice to all businesses in the Special District, urging them to be aware. In the future, when salesmen come, they must recognize the office's badge and the identification card they carry. If they are impersonating, send them to the police for investigation. Do not be fooled."</p>

<h3 id="e156">Apprentice Beaten to Death by Colleagues <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Xiqiao, 39 years old, from Dongchang Town, Qidong County, worked in the printing department of Liangchen Haoyou Society on Beijing Road. His son, Fusheng (an only son adopted by four families), is 15 years old this year. He was recommended by his brother to work as an apprentice in the Yiming Printing House opened by Lin Heqin at 15 Xinshun Lane, Gamsdong Road, French Concession, in July last year. On the 18th of last month, at 9:00 PM, Fusheng was working on the printing press, running the motor at full speed. His colleague Liu Wendao saw him playing ball nearby and, fearing danger, tried to stop him, but he did not listen. Another colleague, Wang Mujin (about 22 or 23 years old) from Jiangwan, slapped Zhou's face. Zhou fought back, and Wang used an iron key from the printing press to hit Zhou's head, kicking him several times. Zhou's left forehead was hit with a hole, and blood flowed like a stream. Colleagues took tooth powder to bandage him, but the blood continued to flow, and the injury became serious. Zhou's uncle and fellow villagers surrounded Wang Mujin and wanted to take him to the police station for investigation. However, Lin Dehua, the accountant of the printing house, came forward to mediate and guaranteed medical treatment and compensation. On the 24th, Fusheng was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, the injury became meningitis, and the treatment was ineffective. He died at 3:00 AM the day before yesterday. The murderer, Wang Mujin, learned that Fusheng's injury was serious and that he had died. He fled back to Jiangwan overnight with his father, Wang Maofu (father and son work together). The father of the deceased reported the incident to the police. The police sent detectives to arrest the murderer, but he was nowhere to be found. Only the iron key used in the crime was taken to the police station. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for an autopsy. Yesterday, the Criminal Section of the French Police Department reported to the French Concession Hall. Judge Zhu Cheng examined the body and sat in the official position. According to the informant's report, the circumstances of the case were explained, and the murder weapon was presented. According to the father of the deceased's appeal to arrest the murderer and redress the grievance, Judge Zhu questioned the witness Liu Wendao about the circumstances of the incident. It was determined that Zhou Fusheng died before his death because he was hit in the head with an iron key by Wang Mujin and sent to the hospital for treatment. After a long time, the treatment was ineffective, and he died. The corpse was allowed to be collected by his family. The defendant's residence is in Jiangwan. The plaintiff should file a lawsuit for investigation and judgment.</p>

<p>Pang Zhaoyin, 33 years old, from Huai'an, residing at 18 Yangjiazhai, Pudong, was a foreman at British American Tobacco Company. At about 10:00 PM the night before last, he went with his brother-in-law, Ye Jian, to the prostitute Zhang Hongyu (18 years old) at the Wang-owned chicken house at 14 Gui'an Lane, Min Tine Yin Road, French Concession. After paying the overnight fee, Pang and others went out for a walk and ate refreshments because the brothel stipulated that they could not sleep until after 12:00. At 12:00, his brother-in-law went home alone, while Pang went to the brothel to sleep. During intercourse, he became intoxicated and died from spermatorrhea. The prostitute was terrified and screamed for help. The madam and servants helped Pang down and reported to the police. Because his name was unknown at the time, there was no way to investigate the address of his family. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for an autopsy. Yesterday, the Criminal Section of the French Police Department reported to the French Concession Hall. Judge Zhu Cheng examined the body and determined that he died of a sudden illness while prostituting. He ordered that a photo be taken, and the hall would provide a coffin for collection. His family waited until noon yesterday and did not see Pang return home. He asked Ye, who went to the brothel to find out that the deceased had parents, a wife, two sons, and a daughter who depended on the deceased for their livelihood. His parents are trying to collect the body.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the Hubei Education Department's submission of the Hubei Provincial Compulsory Education First Phase Implementation Plan and the 19th Year First Phase First Year Implementation Plan, approves the record without any objections. The following is a brief record of the province's plan: (1) "Report Before the Compilation of the Plan" In the 17th year, the province established the Provincial Compulsory Education Committee. In the 18th year, it conducted a survey of school-age children in the provincial capital, and 15 counties established Compulsory Education Committees. At the same time, the province directly established 160 primary schools to advocate for various counties. However, due to funding and local security reasons, few counties directly organized compulsory education, and many provincial and county primary schools were also closed. The existing schools are far from sufficient to accommodate the existing school-age children. Last year's Second National Education Conference has formulated a plan to promote compulsory education nationwide. The province has followed the order to adapt to the needs of school-age children and has referred to the actual situation of the local situation to formulate the First Year (19th year) Implementation Plan. It is divided into four phases with five years as one phase, taking August of the 19th year to July of the 24th year as the first phase, and formulated the First Phase Implementation Plan of Compulsory Education in Hubei Province. (2) "Preparations for Immediate Attention" At the beginning of this plan, the Provincial Compulsory Education Committee will first count the number of school-age children in the provincial capital that have been surveyed, and request the Education Department to urge all counties to establish Compulsory Education Committees. Those that have been established will be ordered to quickly organize surveys and statistics and formulate a school establishment plan. At the same time, expand the propaganda and promote the literacy movement so that the general public and education authorities can work together to ensure that all plans can be implemented step by step. (3) "Teacher Training Plan" From August of the 19th year to July of the 24th year, teacher training will be conducted in ten semesters, such as establishing provincial rural normal schools, rural teacher training institutes, adding compulsory education classes to women's normal schools, opening provincial normal colleges and attached special courses, opening teacher training correspondence departments, holding summer schools, opening private school teacher training classes, opening county rural normal schools, and holding various teacher registration, etc. (4) "Phased School Establishment Plan" There are four detailed measures for the province to directly organize schools (establishment of provincial compulsory education experimental zones and measures for adding classes in each phase). There are five detailed measures for counties to directly organize schools (establishment of county compulsory education experimental zones and plans for adding classes in counties with relatively affluent, sub-affluent, poor, and very poor funding). (5) "Preparation of School Building Plan" The sources of school buildings are divided into three types: borrowing, donation, and new construction. (6) "Fundraising Plan" First, the province will be fully responsible for the first year. From the second year onwards, the resolution of the National Education Conference will be presented to the central government to urge local authorities to implement it separately. Second, the province plans to handle the fundraising of compulsory education funds in various counties in two phases during these five years. In the first phase, the province will directly organize compulsory education in various counties. At the same time, counties that can directly organize will be given subsidies according to their quantity and achievements. In the later phase, the counties will directly organize completely. The Education Department may transfer the original provincial primary school buildings and school equipment to the county education bureau to manage the central primary school according to its performance and subsidize each county's compulsory education by 10% with provincial funds as decided by the National Education Conference. Third, regarding the methods for counties to directly raise compulsory education funds, in the first year and the second year, they will focus on reorganizing the original education funds and allocate 80% of the new income from the reorganization to compulsory education funds. From the third year onwards, counties that have not collected land tax should uniformly collect compulsory education land tax. Those who have collected land tax and used it for other purposes should fully allocate it to compulsory education funds. In the future, the county education bureau will propose additional production taxes or other surcharges based on the production in the area under its jurisdiction to increase funding. All of the funds will be used as the county's compulsory education funds. The procedures should be submitted by the county education bureau to the education department to consult with the finance department and report to the provincial government for implementation.

<p>Since Wang Liemao took office as the head of the Dinghai County Education Bureau, he has had no concrete plans for the county's educational facilities, and he also has many shortcomings in academic knowledge and private morality. Recently, the education circle of the county, for the sake of the county's educational future, has unanimously expressed their opposition and has jointly filed a complaint with the province for his dismissal. The content of the complaint is as follows: 1. Since taking office, there has been no progress in the implementation of education. 2. Private individuals with no educational knowledge are appointed as inspectors of the education bureau and principals of county schools. 3. He gambles every day and neglects education.

<h3 id="e178">The End of the City Scout Inspection <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Capture of the Enemy General who Attacked the Camp</p>
<p>Prizes Awarded on Themed Names</p>
<p>The Shanghai City-wide Scout Inspection and Camporee has concluded. Council members are currently expediting the closing procedures. Various troops are also dispatching personnel to claim the prizes they earned. However, on the night of the fifth, dozens of students, including a Mr. Xiao from the Fudan High School, attempted to attack the camp. Fortunately, Deputy Commander Wang Gang commanded effectively and captured six spies on the spot, causing the enemy to retreat. This is a common occurrence during scout inspections, as the opposing side uses it to test the organizer's thoroughness in preparation and the depth of their resources. The details are recorded below for reference by those managing scout activities.</p>
<p>News of the Attack Arrives On the morning of the fifth, after the awards ceremony, scout troops from various schools began to depart and return to their schools. There were not many scouts left on the inspection grounds. At that time, the prizes were still displayed on the inspection platform. Deputy Commander Wang Gang, fearing a loss, assigned scouts to watch in shifts. Around 10 p.m., a report suddenly came in that dozens of students, led by a Mr. Wu and a Mr. Xiao, from the Fudan High School, were coming to attack the camp. He immediately issued an emergency order, instructing Security Chief Ni Jiaxi to increase the number of guard teams and diligently patrol. He also issued the password "Do One Good Deed a Day." Around 2 a.m., several dark figures headed straight for the defensive line. The security team questioned them for the password. Knowing that preparations had been made, the students attempted to flee, but female scouts bravely stepped forward and apprehended one person on the spot. Interrogation revealed that a large group of students was lurking around the perimeter. An order was issued for a thorough search, and Xiao, the leader of the vanguard, and five other members were captured. The enemy, finding the defenses too strong to penetrate, fled to the southern villages. At 3:30 a.m., the camp's management team organized a court, appointing Wang Gang, Shen Yu, and Dai Qiliu as military judges to conduct separate interrogations, which concluded at dawn. Later, Wu, the leader of the enemy, presented a certificate from the school requesting their release. After the military judges verified its authenticity, all were handed over to him to take away. The scout troop leaders, admiring the students' bravery in venturing out at night, honored them with a brief salute to show encouragement.</p>
<p>Prize Winners The prizes donated by various sectors, with the exception of the silver tripod donated by Chairman Chiang, which the council retained as a permanent memento, were awarded to the following: The Executive Yuan's silver shield was awarded to the 64th Troop; the Ministry of Military Affairs' silver shield was awarded to the 268th Troop; the Ministry of Navy's flag was awarded to the 7th Troop; the Ministry of Education's silver shield was awarded to the 177th Troop; the Ministry of Interior's silver shield was awarded to the 254th Troop; the Control Yuan's flag was awarded to the 14th Troop; the Training Directorate's flag was awarded to the 196th Troop; Song Ziwen's silver shield was awarded to the 20th Troop; Wang Zhengting's silver shield was awarded to the 268th Troop; Zhang Qun's silver cup was awarded to the 250th Troop; the rest are omitted for brevity.</p>

<p>Location: Ningbo Native Place Association</p>
<p>The unique Ping Pong Champagne Cup Tournament is now in its fourth competition. Twenty teams joined this year, and since the start of the competition on March 1st, the teams have been engaged in a fierce battle, with a total of 189 matches played. The two teams that have made it to the finals are the Gu Jia First Team and the renowned Tianma Team. The strength of these two teams is indeed ideal, as can be seen from their prowess in overcoming numerous obstacles and winning consecutive battles. The sportsmanship of these two teams has been highly praised, which is why they have achieved such good results. It is heard that Mr. Lu Meiniaojun, the secretary of the organizing committee, has said that the organizing committee has been receiving inquiries about the date of the finals from the outside world every day, showing the public's great interest in this event. However, due to the organizing committee members' involvement in the spring horse racing duties, it has been difficult to spare the time to handle the matter. Therefore, the only thing that can be announced is that the finals will still be held at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Xizang Road. The date has not yet been determined but will be arranged as soon as possible within the realm of possibility to avoid disappointment. The announcement will be made immediately once the date is set.</p>

<p>Three World Athletes Participated in Demonstrations, Nearly All Failed</p>
<p>200-Meter, Shot Put, and Discus Break Japanese Records</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) Japan, in preparation for next year's World Games, took the opportunity of holding the All-Kanto Athletic Meet to invite three world athletes from the United States and Switzerland to participate in demonstrations to learn from the techniques of the advanced athletes. The meet was organized by the Japan Athletic Association and held at the Meiji Jingu Stadium on April 25th and 26th. At the opening ceremony, Prince Chichibu, the Emperor's brother, came to the stage to give encouragement. On that day, due to the magical appeal of the three world athletes, tens of thousands of spectators came, creating an unprecedented scene. The most competitive events on the first day were the finals of the 100-meter, shot put, and 1500-meter races. The 100-meter race featured Simpson from the United States, while the main competitor from Japan was Yoshioka. During the semi-finals, Yoshioka's record of 10.7 seconds gave the American athlete a scare. However, before the finals, it was generally predicted that Yoshioka was no match for Simpson, as Simpson had a record of 10.3 seconds. Unexpectedly, Simpson was suppressed by Yoshioka in the finals, and the two reached the finish line at the same time, with a record of 10.7 seconds each. Yoshioka won first place by a chest length. In the 1500-meter final, the Swiss athlete, Marudan, competed against Japan's Tsuda. The two athletes stayed close to each other throughout the race, earning thunderous applause from the audience. Upon reaching the finish line, the Japanese athlete won by four meters, causing the world-renowned middle-distance runner to fail. In the shot put final, the American athlete, Loshan, participated. Loshan's usual record is 47-48 meters, but his performance this time was unexpectedly poor, failing to reach 40 meters throughout. The Japanese athletes, on the other hand, performed exceptionally well. The athlete, Hashibita, broke Saito's Japanese national record with a score of 43.17 meters. In addition, the results of the finals of the long jump, high jump, and 10,000-meter races were also very good. Overall, the three world athletes were completely defeated on the first day, showing that the progress of the Japanese is indeed threatening the world. As a result of the second day's competition, Simpson finally won the 200-meter final. Although the Japanese athletes, Yoshioka and Nakajima, were defeated in this event, they both broke the Japanese record one after another. Nakajima's score in the semi-finals was 21.3 seconds, and Yoshioka's score in the finals was 21.4 seconds. Simpson's score was 21 seconds, all of which are new records. Loshande also got his revenge in the shot put event. Because he was too tired, his first throw reached 14.31 meters, but his subsequent five throws were not good. However, no one could compete with him, and Takata Dayang, who held the Far East record, competed with him, but his score was only over 12 meters. The weakness of Easterners in throwing events was greatly exposed. The results of the two-day men's and women's competitions are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Chu Minyi Requests Promotion of Tai Chi Exercises <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Letter Sent to Four Central Training Department and Other Agencies</p>
<p>Tai Chi Exercises as a Literacy Movement in Physical Education</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Chu Minyi is very knowledgeable about physical education and hygiene and is very active in promoting it. In recent years, he has repeatedly stated that Tai Chi Quan is the most physiological exercise that cannot be achieved by general exercise methods. Therefore, he has spared no effort in promoting it. The number of scholars has gradually increased, and the effect is very significant. The physical education community, which has long been obsessed with Western exercise methods, has been refreshed by this. Mr. Chu is not satisfied with this. Because Tai Chi Quan is good, but it is not easy to popularize because its movements are complicated. It is not a book of physical exercise enlightenment. Teaching students to practice Tai Chi Quan is like teaching illiterate people to recite poetry and books. Therefore, he thinks day and night about how to improve it, taking the advantages of Tai Chi Quan and striving for simple movements to popularize it. Therefore, the invention of Tai Chi exercise originated. Mr. Chu was also afraid that it was not as satisfactory as people wanted, so he extensively consulted advanced figures in the physical education community and celebrities in the academic community to evaluate it. The result of the consultation was unanimous. They believe that it is the most rationalized exercise method, which is sufficient to be popularized throughout the country. It has hundreds of benefits and no disadvantages. Recently, he published all his works into a special book, divided into three steps and six sections, with diagrams and formulas. The description strives to be simple and the movements strive to be simple. Everything about the advantages and disadvantages, difficulties, ease, advantages and disadvantages of various movements, and the principles of physical education are described in detail. It has been printed by the Datong Bookstore and will soon be available to the world. Many people in all walks of life want to see it first. Mr. Chu also believes that the method of popularization will be slower if the government does not promote it. Yesterday, he sent letters to the Central Party Department, the Training Department, the Training Directorate, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, requesting them to actively promote it to promote public sports. The following is the draft of the letter (omitted above). As the European style has gradually spread eastward, our country, which has always been known for its weakness, has gradually paid attention to the strength of the nation and has engaged in physical exercise. In recent years, due to the active promotion of the central government, the public's interest has been strong, so there has been even more rapid development. From the surface, it is indeed a good phenomenon for the future of our nation, but a deeper investigation reveals many malpractices. Let us briefly discuss it. Now, those who talk about physical education must imitate Western methods and purchase all their equipment from foreign countries. A sports field cannot be built without tens of thousands of dollars, and a fitness room cannot be built without thousands of dollars. As for sports equipment and athletes' clothing, they often cost several dollars or more, and those that cost tens of dollars or hundreds of dollars are also common. This is the first point, which is not economical in terms of money. The exercise methods that are popular now require months of practice to become proficient. If you want to improve your skills, it takes years, even decades. This is the second point, which is not economical in terms of time. Today, those who can compete on the sports field must first have a strong physique to be competent. Because all sports are vigorous and require a lot of effort, even those with a strong physique will be out of breath and have palpitations after exercise. The old and weak can imagine the results. As a result, some get sick and some become disabled. This is the third point, which is not economical in terms of strength. If the actual harm is like this, why should we value exercise? The definition of exercise is simply to promote blood circulation and activate muscles and bones. The purpose of exercise is health. If a certain exercise can truly achieve the goal of health without any malpractices, then its methods can be transmitted from the West or from our country. Otherwise, we will not take it. In other words, we want to choose a perfect method to achieve its purpose. The malpractices of the various sports methods that are currently popular have been mentioned above, so we should resolutely abandon them and look for other ways. Therefore, Mr. Minyi, based on his experience of engaging in physical education for thirty years, has carefully studied the advantages and disadvantages, and suddenly realized that he invented Tai Chi exercise. Because its movements are all derived from Tai Chi Quan, it can also be called Tai Chi Quan-style exercise. Tai Chi Quan is the Taoist method in our country's martial arts. Its methods are beneficial and harmless, and it has been recognized by the whole country. However, its movements are frequent and difficult to remember. Therefore, it has been improved to be simple and become Tai Chi exercise, but it does not lose its original advantages. The advantages of Tai Chi exercise are three. First, it does not take time. It only takes a few minutes to complete a set of Tai Chi Quan exercises, which will not interfere with working hours. Second, it does not cost money. It only requires bare hand practice, whether indoors or outdoors, without equipment or decoration. You can practice it anywhere. Third, it does not take effort. Because Tai Chi exercise focuses on softness and peace, only seeking to promote blood circulation and activate muscles and bones to achieve the goal of health, it does not focus on danger and wonder to confuse people or brag about courage to impress the crowd. With these three major advantages, it is enough to surpass all other exercise methods. Our nation wants to have a healthy body, and we can only rely on this. Mr. Minyi has used this method to promote physical education and give demonstrations in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, which have been highly praised by public opinion and sympathized by the academic community. It is considered to be harmless and sufficient to be popularized throughout the country to promote the nation. Recently, he began to write a special book, which includes a complete set of Tai Chi Quan, including everything, including the reasons for it, and a book of formulas and diagrams, and a hanging map of formulas. He has entrusted the Shanghai Datong Bookstore to print it. The volume is headed by Mr. Li Shizeng, Liu Shangqing, Zhang Yuejun, Zhang Zhijiang, Xiao Mengsheng, and Xu Zhiyi, who have written prefaces based on their experience in practicing Tai Chi Quan or based on the method of Tai Chi exercise, praising it as a creation of the physical education community. The publication of the book is not far away. Your department, which leads the group and develops physical education, will definitely be doubled by Mr. Minyi. In addition to asking for review after the book is published, I will first attach a draft of the first part of the complete Tai Chi exercise book. If you are willing to adopt it and think that it is feasible, please strongly promote it to save the day and strengthen the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Completion of the North China Venue is Near <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The Shandong Provincial Games Opens Today</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence The entire project of the North China Games venue is only half a month away from the scheduled completion date. Currently, it is working hard. There are more than 1,300 workers in total. Today (4th), the weather was cloudy and rainy, and the work did not stop. The field event venues, such as the shot put and discus positions, and the long jump and high jump square pools, have been set up. The cinder track is paved with sand, which is very smooth. Shang Shumei, Zhang Yixian, Guo Shiying, and others measured and buried the starting and finishing wooden signs in the rain today. The construction of the grandstand has reached the ninth level on the south and west sides, and the sixth level on the east side. The rain shelter is also 70-80% complete. The north-facing rostrum is being built on the foundation, and beams and columns are being erected. It will be completed soon, but it will not be available for the Provincial Games. A temporary rostrum is being built on the east side, which will be completed tomorrow. The external construction of the new office building has also been completed, and the interior walls are being decorated. The North China Preparatory Committee will soon be able to move in to work. After the closing of the North China Games, it will be used as the office for the Shandong Provincial Public Sports Field. The Shandong Provincial Games is scheduled to be held from the 7th to the 10th. The day before the opening ceremony (5th), all instructors will gather at the Public Cinema in the city to first study all the matters of the Games. The groups and schools participating in the Provincial Games are continuing to register.</p>
<p>Also, the North China Preparatory Committee has recently received a batch of prizes. The list is as follows: The Shandong Provincial Party Department donated a silver shield with the inscription "The Strength of the North." Zhang Jiancun, a member of the Shandong Provincial Rectification Committee, donated a silver shield with the inscription "Pioneer for the People." Shang Zhen, the Chairman of Shanxi Province, donated a silver shield with the inscription "The Foundation of a Strong Country" (the above are not designated for which event). Jiang Bocheng, the Chief Counselor of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and his wife, Jiang Zhang Weixian, donated a silver shield with the inscription "Physical Education Saves the Country," specifically designated for the women's junior division.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow" is the word that most relaxes people's minds. How many "tomorrows" can one have in a lifetime? Many ambitious people are misled by the thought of "tomorrow." Therefore, Western philosophers say, "Do not leave today's work for tomorrow." This is a true saying.</p>
<p>Love is originally a comedy, but it is precisely because of its comedy that it is interesting. If you take it too seriously, the result of love is only pain.</p>
<p>Those who labor with their minds eat what their minds labor for, and those who labor with their bodies eat what their bodies labor for. "Who knows that every grain on the plate is hard-earned?" This saying was originally sung for farmers, but if you savor it carefully, people all over the world should think like this.</p>
<p>Prostitutes sell their smiles in a tangible way, while literati sell their smiles in an intangible way. Xu Zhuodai compared himself to someone leaning against the door when he compiled the "Smiling Paintings," which is very meaningful.</p>
<p>Lin Pinqing spent her entire life only paying off debts with tears. In fact, who in the world is not like this? Only tears have a heart. The tears in the heart are even more painful than the tears in the eyes.</p>
<p>People have infatuation, favoritism, respect, and affection for their wives. The result of infatuation and favoritism is the Ji Chang addiction in the world. Those who want to enjoy true happiness in the boudoir, why not change infatuation to respect and shift favoritism to affection?</p>
<h3 id="e196">A Record of the Self-Defense Corps of Xiaxi Village, Fenghua <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bing'an</p>
<p>There is a village called Xiaxi in the mountains of Fenghua, about a hundred miles away from the county seat. It is adjacent to Xinchang and is a place where bandits often appear. Nearby villages have been burned and looted. Those who pass through the area, if they do not prepare in advance, will be taken advantage of by these bandits. They may rob property or kidnap people. The ransom for the kidnapped does not necessarily have to be wealthy, and the ransom price can be as low as tens of dollars, unlike the kidnapping in Shanghai, where the price is often tens of thousands of dollars. Xiaxi Village is located in the bandit area. With the help of the self-defense corps, it is the only village that can be completely preserved. The village is surrounded by mountains, and the terrain is very dangerous. The Dong family is the largest family. Dong Huating and his brothers are well-fed and are skilled in shooting. They can hit flying birds with 100% accuracy. For a time, they were known as "Flying Guns." Seeing the prevalence of banditry, he warned his clan members, "Born in a time of turmoil, bandits are rampant. Our village is far from the city, and the military and police cannot reach it. It is especially easy for bandits to covet. We must take precautions. Now, I agree with the elders and brothers in the village that all young adults in the village should learn shooting. Women should also engage in this after managing household affairs. Then, once a disaster occurs, we can be prepared." Everyone said it was good. Huating donated money to purchase weapons and established a self-defense corps. When the corps members are not busy, they farm. When something happens, they are temporarily summoned. Huating and his brothers serve as coaches. Huating also assessed the terrain of the village, where to defend and where to attack. The planning is detailed and organized. After a long time, it became an elite force. At first, the bandits thought that Xiaxi Village was small and easy to start. One night, they came to rob the village with torches. Huating learned of this in advance and gathered dozens of strong men to ambush on the main road, waiting with live ammunition. The bandits did not know and led the team to advance, many of whom were ambushed and killed. Therefore, they fled in droves. From then on, the bandits warned each other not to dare to commit crimes. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, a group of bandits called Thousands of People planned to rob a certain village, but they had to pass through Xiaxi. They sent messengers to Huating in advance to ask for permission to pass. They also said that if he did not allow them, they would first rob Xiaxi Village. Huating did not move. Dozens of bandits came with whips and then left. Therefore, the bandits hated Huating and his brothers to the bone and offered 5,000 dollars to buy Huating and his brothers. They were so feared by the bandits. When the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Jiangzhe, our remaining warlords in Yong heard the news and led their troops to flee. Wherever they passed, they set fires and robbed chickens and dogs, but they finally did not dare to touch Xiaxi Village. This is also strange. Huating is skilled in shooting, and his wife and daughter are also experts in their own right, with every bullet hitting the target. His son, Zhenhan, followed my brother-in-law, Le Bin, to travel, so I learned the details. I hereby record it to enrich this discussion and tell the world those who are running the security corps.</p>

<p>— Ms. Yeh Hua</p>
<p>It has been a long time since Chaplin acted in a circus, three years to be exact. Three years ago, a German reporter allowed the American leftist writer Sinclair to interview Chaplin. Sinclair returned home and wrote an article about Chaplin's writing, directing, and starring in the production of "City Lights." He said that Chaplin worked hard day and night. After the film was completed, it was destroyed because it was not satisfactory, and then re-shot. This happened countless times. The article was reprinted in the magazine Living Age, November 1929. In the same year, my younger brother Lingfeng translated it into Chinese. This highly anticipated masterpiece is now premiering in Shanghai in this season of new green willows and blooming peach and plum blossoms.</p>
<p>I once said that the biggest problem in life is to not see the true state of the world. It is clearly a society of male thieves and female prostitutes, but it is still called a land of sages and propriety. Chaplin, on the screen, can make people carefully examine contemporary society. In the vastness of life, he often grasps segments of life and uses artistic techniques to imply their meaning. His works are not only expressions of life but also interpretations of life. Chaplin is a comedian but also a tragedian. His background is full of heartbreaking sights and is full of blood and tears. Watching this play further strengthens the belief that the rich in the play are like two different people when awake and drunk. This is a depiction of dual personalities. The formation of dual personalities is due to the functions of the unconscious and conscious mind, and it is also the general pivot of good and evil. It is not an exaggeration to say that a person's life is a history of the conflict of dual personalities. The fact that the tramp is imprisoned for saving a woman proves that crime has meaning and injustice. The wealthy create poverty, and the law cannot guarantee human rights. This makes people feel a sense of resentment towards the concept of rewarding and punishing. The tramp struggles with fate and is innocently humiliated, which is like speaking out against injustice for ordinary people. The whole play cannot escape love because "love" is the essence of life and the vitality of new life. Loving a lonely blind friend is deeply meaningful. If the ending is a broken heart, it can show the world's ingratitude and the fact that love is truly blind. However, the fact that it ends happily is why this comedy is called a comedy. The film is silent but plays sound music. The lighting throughout the film is black, gray, and white, fully revealing the nature of photography. It is similar to Chaplin's "A Woman of Paris." Aside from the dance hall, there are only two or three people in the film. Chaplin is still wearing his old clothes, the eighteen-year-old rubber New York actor's specially made mustache is still intact. I felt endlessly moved while watching this film. Compared to those who have hundreds of legs dancing in unison, with the aroma of meat filling the air, and who sing love songs without thinking while walking and dancing, the difference is immeasurable.</p>
<h3 id="e202">THE FATED LOVE AFFAIR AND A NOVEL MODEL <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Tanglu</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many people who have studied novels with me, but they have been troubled by the lack of a novel model to help them learn by analogy. Since Zhang Henshui's "The Fated Love Affair" caused a sensation and broke the records of previous novelists, the excellent structure and skillful descriptions in the book are obvious to all and need no further explanation. However, it is difficult to find a good novel, and it is even more difficult to find a good critic of a novel. "Dream of the Red Chamber" is certainly excellent, but the critics of "Dream of the Red Chamber" are all mediocre and unable to enhance the book's brilliance. "The Fated Love Affair" is famous because of Zhang Henshui's wonderful writing, and it is even more famous because of Duhe's wonderful commentary. Although Duhe only wrote a preface, the preface is very long and reveals the methods of writing "The Fated Love Affair" and the essence of the book. It can be regarded as a general commentary that complements the book perfectly. It is truly a wonderful story in the garden of literature. Whenever students ask me about the methods of writing novels, I always say, "Why don't you buy "The Fated Love Affair" as a novel model? It has Zhang Henshui's wonderful writing and Duhe's wonderful commentary. "The embroidered mandarin ducks are there for you to see" is Zhang Henshui's work, and "handing the golden needle to others" is Duhe's commentary. The students, upon hearing my words, each bought a copy of "The Fated Love Affair" and studied it carefully. As a result, their thinking and writing skills improved day by day. They thanked me for my guidance. I said, "You don't need to thank me, you should thank Zhang Henshui, and especially thank Duhe, who commented on Zhang Henshui's work."</p>
<h3 id="e203">THE OLD CAPITAL IN SPRING <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Jiguan</p>
<p>My old friend Mr. Yu Yue came south from Pingjin yesterday and told me about the latest news from the old capital. Feeling bored by the sunny window, I picked up my pen and wrote about it.</p>
<p>Since the government established its capital in Nanjing, the spring scenery of the old capital has changed greatly. Although dance halls have been opened and female attendants have been widely used in recent years, the markets are deserted and all industries remain depressed. This is why the general people of Beiping are frowning and sighing. The call for a prosperous Ping city is very high. Until last month, when Zhang Xueliang organized the Deputy Commander's Office in Ping, the majority of citizens began to feel that there was hope for realizing prosperity. They were excited and colorful, and the market situation was revitalized, which was truly unprecedented in the past few years.</p>
<p>Famous restaurants in Beiping, such as Dalu Chun and Tongchun Yuan, are located on Chang'an Street, no fewer than ten or so. Their usual business is desolate. During Zhang Xueliang's presence in Ping, they were crowded with customers every day. The archways in the Qianmen area are tall and the electric lights are bright at night, attracting many tourists. The major silk shops took this opportunity to reduce prices and attract customers, which was also very profitable. Other industries, such as theaters and amusement parks, also saw an increase in revenue. Mr. Chu Minyi even took the stage to perform a crosstalk in Hualeyuan, performing an excerpt from "The Weishui River". That evening, Zhang Xueliang specifically booked several boxes to invite guests to enjoy the performance. Important figures such as Hu Ruoyu and Yu Xuezhong all came together, beaming with joy and celebrating peace in the bright spring, adding color to the Ping market.</p>
<h3 id="e204">TRAVELS IN INDIA (45) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On February 1st, I attended a meeting with Ms. La Haoying, Fei Libu, Keli, Swiss Ms. Hoy, Mrs. Phillips Currie Holz, Zedi, the president of the La Haoying Student Union, and Zhendixin, the secretary of the hall. Ms. Hoy, a young Swiss woman in her early twenties, said that the Swiss did not understand the meaning of war. Fei Libu said that male politics is the root of war. The government collects our taxes, turning our money and property into guns and cannons, and even conscripts our lives as tools of masculinity. I only have one son who is seventeen years old this year. I don't know when a major war will suddenly break out, and my son's life will not be guaranteed. Ms. Keli said that her friend, Ms. Meili's first husband died in the war, and her second husband also died in the war. Now she has married her third husband with great difficulty, and she is very afraid every time she hears of war. In the past, Rome had a proverb that Roman men managed all the men in the world, and the wives of Roman men managed our husbands. However, their management was not good, only allowing the Roman heroes to slaughter the world. In the future, we should change to a good law to teach children not to learn to fight and kill. Student Union President Jai Dev held a letter questioning, roughly saying that the root of world wars is still material. Generally, he based his arguments on Marxist academic theory, because many young people in India now know Marx. Fei Libu said that her family had a mother cat who gave birth to four kittens. One day, the mother cat went out and all the kittens were bitten to death by male cats, and their intestines were broken open, but they were not eaten. From this observation, the male's nature is to kill the offspring of the female, which has nothing to do with Marx. The male old cat kills the kittens without eating them, which is no different from the massacre of a city by a great robber. Genghis Khan and Napoleon were also great male cats. I don't fully believe in Marx's words. Ms. Keli said that her family had two hens and three roosters. Each of the two hens brought more than ten chicks to forage for food separately without fighting. The roosters had no burden of chicks and easily fought when they met, which proves that fighting is not necessarily related to the problem of bread. Ms. Keli said that everyone knows if the future war starts from which country? Everyone did not answer her. She said that she was afraid that England and the United States would compete for dominance. As a result, Ms. Fei Libu was appointed as an organizing committee member of La Haoying City.</p>
<p>On the 2nd, Ms. Keli and her daughter came to Fei Libu's house. Fei Libu said that Ms. Keli was a leader among British women with knowledge and profound academic skills. She asked me many questions that were related to explaining that she had seen four ducklings hatched by a hen in the garden. I asked her why she had let the hen hatch ducks. She said that she had chicken eggs, but after hatching, only ducks were left. The hen loved the ducks as if they were her own, without any discrimination. When an eagle and dog looked down, the hen made an angry shape to protect the ducklings. This matter is very interesting and can prove that the maternal rights of animals protect their offspring not only by protecting their own offspring but also by protecting what they raise. Now the male system is killing each other because the mothers only know how to raise them, but do not know how to protect their offspring rights. I thought that her observation of animals was very philosophical. This matter was once considered a major issue by Goethe and his friend, a certain great biologist, because one day Goethe's friend saw a wren bird being raised in a robin's nest. The friend told Goethe, and the two used this example to say that it was a great invention of animal socialism. Animals can truly unconsciously implement the principles of not only loving their own parents but also loving their own children, which is far superior to humans. Now, Ms. Fei Libu has also paid attention to this.</p>

<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Because of this thought, my attitude calmed down instead, and I said to him again, "There is a twist here that you haven't understood yet. The person who ran away is the real culprit. If you don't believe me, I can go after him with you. Maybe it's still in time." The man lazily replied as he put the pearl necklace in his pocket, "I was planning to save some energy." Seeing that this person was unreasonable, I was both angry and hateful, but I couldn't think of any solution for a while. But the culprit who framed me had already escaped far away, and this matter had been made stiff by this person. I patiently said again, "I am a guest of the Gao family and just came out of there." He interrupted, "That's right, I know that your companion also came out of the Gao family." I said, "Are you really treating me as an accomplice? Fine, now I'll go back to the Gao family with you." The detective said, "That won't do. We should still go to the police station." I couldn't help but say angrily, "Alright, I'll go with you, but you must know that I am Bao Lang." This hateful detective suddenly grabbed me and said, "You're called Bao Long? Haha, even Bao Longtu doesn't matter. Let's go, let's go."</p>
<p>Turning east from Qinghai Road is the Fourth Police Station. It's about a two-minute walk from the scene of the incident. On the way, I thought to myself that I was unlucky tonight to have encountered this brute. But this misunderstanding can be explained immediately at the police station. However, the issue of this necklace and the thief who stole it has already escaped, so it can't be resolved temporarily. I had seen that person face to face. Although it was only for a brief moment, I had some confidence in the person's appearance. Hawthorn and I often discussed methods of observing faces. First, when looking at the eyes, you must pay attention to the eyes, nose, and the lines on the face to see if there are any peculiarities. Once this impression is left, it is not easy to forget. I remember seeing that the person's nose was somewhat hooked, and his small eyes looked like edges when looking at people. These two peculiarities are enough to serve as a basis for identification. I am confident that if I see him a second time, he will definitely not escape my gaze. But who is this person, and where is he going now? According to this detective, this person also came out of the Gao family. How come I didn't see him? I don't know if there will be any difficulties in the investigation.</p>

<p>Opens Flat, Plunges at Noon</p>
<p>Trading Among Firms Still Lacks Large Volumes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 6th, the gold price once again showed a downward trend, with the weight already testing the 740 tael level. The situation within the customs was very flat, with fluctuations of only one or two taels. However, from morning to noon, there was a total of more than seven taels of difference. Looking back, it ended up falling five taels again. The selling sentiment among firms was very strong. It was still firm in the early morning, but almost as soon as the overseas silver market rose and fell differently, there was a slight shrinkage and hovering around 41 taels. Because the official and unofficial exchange rates were both flat, suddenly at noon there was a flood of looseness, and the stable market was turned into fatigue by the sellers. There was a sharp drop of seven taels, and the situation was soft. Finally, it only counted 36 taels. In the afternoon, because it was the spring racing season, the market was still closed. In the early morning, the June opening rose by one tael to 742 taels, followed by two taels and five cents. The price for large bars suddenly rose by sixteen-one-hundredths, and the silver price was reduced by eight-one-hundredths. Private telegraphs were the same, and because the United States sold out, people's hearts were high. Afterwards, because Yu Dafeng and Yongfeng and others sold, the price fell by one tael. At 9:00, the British gold announcement was unchanged, only the East Exchange hung up at 25, but it was not moved, and it had fallen to 40 taels. After entering the bank, the bank ate up 375 British gold, and in addition, Yuan Maoyong, Fuyu and Hedging and others bought in, gradually moving forward. At 9:50, it rose to 42 taels and 9 cents. Afterwards, Yuan Cheng and Yongheng and others sold out, slightly less than one tael and zero. At 10:10, it was 41 taels and 6 cents, and after a quarter of an hour, it added one tael to two taels and five cents. Because Gan Changxiang, Heng Yu Dada, and Desheng sold, it fell by more than one tael. At 10:45, it was 41 taels, and suddenly Hengxing came to buy. Also, Taiwan absorbed 375 British gold in August, so it increased by one tael. At 11:10, it was 42 taels and 4 cents. After that, it showed a downward trend. There was more supply than demand on the table. Because British gold was loose, 375 was difficult to sell. Hua Bi and others bought 4375 to 11:30, it had broken 40 taels. Yongfeng had a strong desire to sell, and the numbers followed suit, and the momentum was unstoppable. The market sentiment was agitated, and it continued to fall by four or five taels. At 11:50, it ended at 35 taels and 2 cents. At this time, the general retailers took the opportunity to drag in, and because MacCall, Mitsui, and Hua Bi and others also paid in 4375 British gold in June and July, they immediately pulled up by more than one tael to 37 taels, but the selling trend did not stop. It closed at 36 taels, down five taels compared with the previous noon. After the close, it was made up to six taels. According to the largest price of 42 taels and 9 cents and the smallest price of 35 taels and 3 cents in half a day, there was a difference of 7 taels and 6 cents. The item price in the early market was 42 taels and 2 cents, and the noon closing price was 36 taels. The listed price was changed to 778 taels and 2 cents, a difference of 378 taels to 42 taels. The logged price was 36 taels, and the make-up water was 34 taels. Although trading among firms was active, there were no large volumes. Da Xingyong, Heng Xing, Shunli, Wanxing, and Zhen Changxiang all bought in. Yuan Maoyong, Zhifengyong, Da Decheng, Futaiheng, and Hengyu fluctuated sharply. Yongfeng sold more than 1,000 bars. Yuancheng, Xinheng, Yiyu, Yuda, Yuantai, and speculator Wu and others generally sold the front lining. Gan Changxiang had more sales than purchases. Cuichangyong sold early and bought later. The Dalian gang bought a total of 1,500 to 1,600 bars and only sold 200 to 300 bars. The Guangdong gang had no transactions at the beginning and suddenly bought 500 bars in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the third day of the Spring Races, and the foreign exchange market was still only open for half a day in the morning. The British silver reported an increase, and the American silver shrank, showing a divergent trend that was the opposite of the day before. The exchange rate of HSBC, except for the East Exchange adding 25, calculated as one tael, six qian, one fen, five, was generally unchanged. The inland market for British, American, Japanese, etc. currencies was flat in the morning, and loosened at noon as the gold price became firm, initially dropping to 35 or 36 taels, which was in fact large accounts dumping and speculators shorting. The British gold rose by 0.0625 compared to the previous day when the market closed at noon, while the American gold rose by 0.125, and the Japanese gold rose by a small margin. Chinese merchants had few large transactions, only Fuchang, Chengfeng, and Yong slightly selling British gold. By noon, most companies were also selling, and banks were still able to take in, such as Maxing, Mitsui, Taiwan Zhengjin, and Huabi, all of which purchased about 100,000 pounds. American gold was also sold slightly, while Japanese gold had few transactions.</p>

<p>The general market situation: In the same time of previous years, the amount of silk cocoons was extremely large and the demand for silver dollars was also very high. However, this year, because there are few people collecting silk cocoons, no one pays attention to it. Moreover, the transportation of silver dollars is dangerous, so people are not willing to buy silver dollars in cash and prefer to use banknotes instead. Therefore, the use of silver dollars has become insignificant. There is a reason for the fall of silver cents yesterday. As for the use of silver cents for tea, it has become the end of the line and no one has the power to compete strongly. Therefore, the silver cent market is no longer as prosperous as it used to be.</p>
<p>Cent Exchange Price (Silver Cent): The early market cent price was seven qian, three fen, two li, two hao, and half, which was slightly less than half a li compared to the early market of the previous day.

(Silver Exchange): Both the early and noon markets opened at four fen, which was one fen better than the previous day. There were also three or four fen of head adding water.

<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation: The early and noon markets for Jiangnan small dollars were the same at six qian, five fen, two li, and half, which was slightly better than the noon market of the previous day by half a li. Transactions made: 3,500 jiao in the early market, no transactions in the noon market. The early market for Guangdong small dollars was six qian, four fen, eight li, the noon market was six qian, four fen, eight li, two hao, and half. Transactions made: 140,000 jiao in the early market, 50,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins did not move and remained at 376,000 wen. Transactions of about 30,000 strings were weak.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds): Because the banks were not open in the afternoon due to the Spring Racing season, the receipt and release of funds were still sparse. Chinese banks received and released more than 2.5 million yuan in ticket funds, foreign banks received and released more than 1.67 million yuan in ticket funds, and various goods, exchange rates, taxes, and miscellaneous funds received and released more than 9 million yuan. 600,000 yuan were deposited into the warehouse and 500,000 yuan were withdrawn from the warehouse. Japanese banks received and released more than 4.2 million yuan in various funds and withdrew 500,000 yuan from the warehouse.

<p>Yesterday, the stock market situation of each public bond market in this city had a total of only 9,000 yuan issued in the spot market throughout the day. Although the futures market was slightly smoother than the previous day, the market sentiment also felt slightly dispersed. However, the buying and selling transactions continued to be active, with a total of 11 million yuan issued in the morning and more than 10 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 21.5 million yuan. Among them, 20 volumes accounted for 5.08 million yuan, and the demobilization of troops in 19 and the good compilation and dispatch in 19 also each had 3 to 4 million yuan. The tariff for the 20th year was also good, but other debts were still more idle. The trend of each debt price was stronger in the front market because the buying sentiment at that time was still stronger than the selling. The rear market showed a slight looseness, and the selling transactions from all parties were slightly dominant. As a result, the debt fluctuated and gradually decreased, but the result was that, compared with the previous day, the other debts had mutual rises and falls, except that the compilation and dispatch period of May fell by nearly 2 yuan, and the number was very small.</p>

<h3 id="e212">COTTON YARN MARKET TRENDING UPWARD <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is showing a firm and slightly bullish trend. This is because the Osaka Sanpin yarn is trending upward, and the actual sales in the Sichuan gang are relatively strong, with larger package amounts, resulting in good market sentiment. Moreover, with the increasing inventory of each factory and the low price of yarn and the high price of cotton, the yarn factories are experiencing extreme pain, and the atmosphere of reducing working hours is strong. Some nervous people are buying in, but the overall situation is still softening because the season is late, and the various farming activities are busy, which inevitably reduces sales. The chaotic situation is closely related to the future of yarn sales.</p>
<p>The human target is up one or two strengths. The human target's previous market opening was calm due to the slight decline in American cotton, but some people bought in, and the market was slightly firm. As a result, each month was flat. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Sichuan gang had a batch of transactions, and the Sanpin yarn rose, causing the market sentiment to suddenly tighten. Each month rose by two qian to one tael and seven qian. The transaction was calculated at 17,050 packages. It was found that Changfeng sold 950 packages, Yida 750 packages, Tianlong 550 packages, Shenxin 550 packages, and Jifeng 750 packages. Gengfeng bought 3,200 packages, Shenji 700 packages, Yiyu 1,000 packages, and Dachang 900 packages. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>July 1598 Up 1378300 October 1563 Up 1226400</p>
<p>Yarn Sales: 2,500 packages. The sales of existing yarn are still good. It was found that the total amount bought by each gang throughout the day was 2,500 packages. 1,000 packages were entered in the peer group. The market is trending upward. Among the customer gangs, Sichuan entered 1,850 packages, the interior entered 110 packages, Hankou entered 115 packages, the North Gang entered 90 packages, Qingdao entered 45 packages, Gaoyang entered 250 packages, and Miscellaneous entered 120 packages.</p>

<p>The cotton market is relatively weak, with overseas cotton markets remaining soft. US cotton experienced a slight drop, and gold prices softened slightly, leading to a neutral sentiment. Yarn prices are not rising, and factories are experiencing sluggish demand with increasing talks of reduced production. Consequently, the market trend is somewhat loose. However, bullish traders are holding tight due to low inventory levels. The global cotton market remains dull and uninspired.</p>
<p>Hankow Standard Slightly Soft: In the previous session, Hankow Standard cotton was dampened by falling US cotton prices, leading to increased selling pressure. Prices for various months fell by one or two qian. The afternoon opening saw a further drop of two qian, before recovering to close flat. Total trading volume was 48,900 dan. Sales included He Shen (3,400 dan), Tai Xing (2,400 dan), Yong Feng (1,100 dan), Zhen Da (1,100 dan), and Chang Feng (2,100 dan). Purchases included Yi Yu (4,500 dan), Yuan Da (3,200 dan), Shen Chang (1,700 dan), and Tong Xing (1,500 dan).

<p>US cotton market sentiment turned flat. Yesterday, US cotton initially strengthened due to large-scale buying, but later softened due to selling from the South and weakness in Wall Street. Futures fell by 9 to 12 points. Spot prices remained unchanged. UK cotton futures rose by 7 to 8 points, and spot prices rose by 13 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 20 points. Indian cotton market conditions were strong and rising due to purchases by Japanese traders. Pingle and Bairuo Creek rose by 6 rupees, and Omra rose by 5 rupees.

<p>Yesterday, the staple rice market saw excellent sales in this street, with market conditions visibly improving. Prices jumped by five or six fen to several jiao. Hunan rice and Jiangxi early machine-milled rice had lower inventories. Jiangxi late machine-milled rice had more stock, and transactions were more frequent than other types of rice. The quoted prices were: Jiangxi late machine-milled rice, 1,500 bags, priced at 11 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen to 10 yuan 0 jiao 5 fen; Jiangxi early machine-milled rice, 200 bags, priced at 10 yuan 0 jiao 6 fen; Hunan machine-milled rice, 100 bags, priced at 10 yuan 0 jiao 8 fen.

<h3 id="e216">Flour Market Strengthens Due to Rain <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning, and conditions in each month were generally stable. Although imported wheat quotations were better by one or two jiao, the weather was still good. Both buyers and sellers saw little special progress, and the market remained stable, with minimal activity. However, after the afternoon opening, heavy rain and the prospect of prolonged rainfall raised concerns about wheat, even though the harvest was still far away. This caused sentiment to turn positive and buying interest to gradually increase, with prices for each month rising by about one fen. The situation should ease if the weather turns clear. As a result, May and June rose one fen compared to the previous day, July rose seven and a half li, August rose five li, September rose one fen, and October rose five li.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Wheat Market Trends Towards Stability Again <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw a trend towards stability in various months during both the morning and afternoon sessions. Better quotations for imported wheat and excessive rainfall also made inland sentiment stable. Additionally, domestic bankruptcies led to limited buying of distant futures. As imported wheat was not suitable and there was uncertainty about the domestic wheat harvest, more observed, and fewer sold, so market sentiment gradually strengthened. As a result, the current month was up two fen compared to the previous day, June was up two fen, and July to October were all up three fen.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Sugar Market: Dali Sugar Opens with Price Cuts <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Icing Sugar and Qing Sales are Smooth, Prices are Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw telegrams from producing areas indicating that Cuban raw sugar continued to fall by 3/125 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures also fell by four or five points. Java spot and futures sugar remained unchanged. The Association market was quiet for the He sugar 24 grade coarse white sugar, with few buyers and a surge in sales, leading to a slight drop in price. The transaction price was 10 liang 04 qian 5 fen, and the market situation was flat. Demand for the 20 grade medium white sugar at 10 liang was also quiet. The factory opening of Japanese sugar continued, and sentiment gradually turned flat. YR brand was 9 liang 9 qian 5 fen, YT brand was 10 liang 05 qian, YP brand was 10 liang 09 qian, TN brand was 10 liang 02 qian 2 fen 5 li, the market situation was weak. Dali sugar was previously offered at 4 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, but due to a lack of inquiries, the price was reduced to 4 yuan 4 jiao. The J mark plus 2 jiao, the SH mark price was 4 yuan 1 jiao, and the total volume for June and July delivery was 15,000 bags. Except for the hard work of the Gaojin, Fuhe, and Yuyu brokers, Mitsui had to pay a deposit at one time and has not yet sold, most of the amounts are not large and should be as desired. The Taikoo sugar for June delivery continued to open 1,000 bags at the original price of DY mark 4 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen, the demand was very scarce, the plate trading was still quiet. The domestic Huanggang Qing continued to open the remaining packages at a price of 1 yuan 7 liang 7 qian 5 fen, and the sale of the factory's icing sugar Qing was still smooth, and the plate still had a tendency to increase the price.</p>

<p>Shipai Longan from Zhangzhou: The base of goods from the origin is not much, resulting in a long-term lack of sources, and the cost is high. The owners have no intention to seek distribution. However, due to the strong interest of the Shanghai market, the trend is rising. Yesterday, it was heard that the Taikoo Jinan wheel transported a batch from Xiamen, only 40 boxes. It is expected that the opening price will definitely increase.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Continuous Wind and Rain... Silkworms Eat Wet Leaves and Excrete Yellow</p>
<p>Farmers in the old Jinhua Prefecture of Zhejiang Province generally start raising silkworms during the Qingming Festival, but due to the cold weather, they delayed until after the Grain Rain Festival to start collecting ants, and the number of ants hatched was only about 70%. After the leaves came out, the weather was not warm and spring rain fell frequently, which was not conducive to the development of silkworms. Farmers and instructors felt very difficult to care for them. In several places, white stiff early silkworms have been found and are now asleep with flourishing leaves. However, due to continuous strong winds and heavy rain, the silkworms eat more leaves. The wet leaves that are collected cannot be dried in time, resulting in the silkworms eating wet leaves and excreting yellow water. Silkworm farmers are generally worried.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Qimen Tea Prices are Difficult to Lower <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Qimen new black tea has officially opened for weighing for a week. The price of high-grade tea from Xilu Zhuang boat plate is above 100 yuan. The price of tender tip tea from Ti Zhuang is 140 to 150 yuan. The price of goods from Nanlu and Fuzhuang has also opened to 80 yuan. Before the Grain Rain, the price of young bud leaves was 600,000 cash copper coins per dan, which is equivalent to more than 200 silver dollars, which is the highest price ever. At the beginning of the opening of each tea shop, the intention for this year's mountain price was to generally reduce it as before, but they knew that the situation of the new tea on the market had changed. In order to rush to get new tea, the industry could not wait and immediately opened the price according to the price. The cautious tea shops knew that the cost was too high and they would be in danger, but because the situation had become a tiger riding, they could not stop and had to follow the price to do a little. Recently, the top-quality goods from high-grade tea plantations in the Jiajia River area of ​​Qixi have been shipping quite well, and the production method is also excellent. Qi · Shining Star · Gaotang · Hengshunxiang and other tea shops are all concentrated there to search for tea, and the price is difficult to lower. The opening and output prices of Baojia Cen · Ya Hang · Pancun roads in recent days still require 80 to 70 yuan. Yesterday and today, the weather was suddenly rainy and suddenly sunny, and the quality of the leaves was not soaked in the morning dew. The shipment will be easier and more inferior. The tea houses are to protect their capital, and they do not care about adding to the mountain households this time. The households are always few tea and many numbers, and they are not worried about backlog. It is still difficult to reduce the price.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Yujiang New Tea is Being Picked <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yujiang (ie Anren) is an important tea-producing area in eastern Jiangxi. The tea is delicate and tender, and is favored by tea shops. However, the aroma is less than that of Wu tea. This year, the climate is turning early, and the head tea of ​​each mountain garden is being picked. In recent days, half of the mountain households have opened their gardens. Although a small number of tea shop customers from Nanchang and Kou are in the mountains to search, the output price is not high. The mountain households have made it ready and are waiting for foreign tea shops to open and then give the price.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Wuchang Tea Picking and Production Affected by Rainy Weather <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The head tea in Wuyuan has been produced in unison for several days, but because the development of late tea is slow, it cannot be picked at the same time. The tea buds have been longer in the past two days, and they are being picked and roasted. Also, because the weather is rainy and there is no morning dew, the aroma is slightly worse. It takes time and effort to stir-fry the leaves and knead the blanks, and the amount of harvest is also less than that in sunny weather. Therefore, the tea picking and production work of mountain households has been greatly affected by the rainy weather.</p>

<p>Zhangshan Yunwu Tea is the highest treasure among foreign green teas. The quality of water, leaves, and aroma is unparalleled in the world. The tea trees in the mountains are in high positions and the climate is cold and less warm. The tea buds develop later than in other places. According to mountain households, the climate this year is also turning early, and the tea trees have shown white hairs and small tips. It can be picked after the tea in each continent has been picked.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Reaction After the Sharp Drop in Piece Goods <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The local cotton cloth market has seen a sharp drop in prices for several days due to the weakness of overseas cotton and yarn. However, it has shown a rebound trend yesterday because the three grades of goods continue to rise and many people urgently need to mortgage money have sold off, and actual sales have gradually become active. The northern help of fine cloth has recovered. Yesterday, more than 300 pieces were transacted. Rainbow balls were 7 liang 4 qian, trumpet boy 7 liang 4 qian 2 fen 5 li, Yanghe 7 liang 4 qian 7 fen 5 li, and Blue Double Fish 7 liang 5 qian 5 li. Blue Chicken is very popular on the street, so it has soared to 7 liang 1 qian 5 li. Fine twill is also purchased by local streets. Yanghe is 7 liang 3 qian 7 fen 5 li, and Blue Double Fish is 7 liang 3 qian. Medium and 9-pound goods are still lacking in coarse cloth. 16-pound goods 11-pound and 13-pound goods once fell slightly, but they also turned up yesterday.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the horse racing season of Western merchants and the clearance period, the prices of east-west piece goods have fallen frequently due to overseas pricing, and sales have been very quiet. Yesterday, only the Changjiang bang of Donghuo's striped government silk was quite popular. The spot goods on the market are very scarce, so all brands have risen unanimously. Qingguan mirror is 3 qian 9 fen 5 li, Huxin Pavilion is 3 qian 9 fen, Yang Guifei is 3 qian 8 fen 7 li. After gradually falling, Changjiang Bang had a lot of searches for straight tribute nines from Hunter Geese, so yesterday it has rebounded by five li and sold for 3 qian 4 fen. Moganshan is 3 qian 5 fen and a half because there are not many spot goods. White cotton cloth is still lifeless. Macao Circus Moganshan Banana Leaf and inscription books have all entered the customs for 4 liang 1 qian, and Huxin Pavilion Biji has to move for 3 qian 2 fen 7 li. Street is gradually moving price selling for about 3 qian 5 fen.</p>

<h3 id="e228">After Seeing the Morning Light Exhibition <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>At dawn, the birds in the graveyard next door were singing very energetically, as if intentionally calling me awake from my sleep.</p>
<p>Deep in my mind was the thought that I would never forget: to visit the Morning Light Fifth Art Exhibition. "Good, go early!" I actually shouted, and the joyful mood was self-evident. But why would it make me so happy? At least I believe that this exhibition will not disappoint me, and I have considerable confidence in it. Especially the works of several strong newcomers have long been eagerly awaited by me, and I want to see what they are like. On the bus, gusts of light breeze brushed around me. I was really fascinated by the morning light, making my heart active. I don't know where the life experiences and various thoughts flew to, but the expression on my face was just an unstoppable smile.</p>
<p>After a long time, the Morning Light venue was stepped on by me. One painting after another appeared before my eyes. They were all full of life, as if they were acting, leading me into the world. Needless to say, their protagonists could cry sadly, but there were also very high-spirited ones, telling me that the future of the nation is bright and limitless as long as we work hard.</p>
<p>Now let me talk casually about my two-hour impression there on the works of old and new writers.</p>
<p>Among the watercolor works, the works of Mr. Song Zhiqin and Mr. Yang Taiyang can be said to be the best in terms of skills. Mr. Song is better with several sketches, such as "Stream Tree", "Village", "Spring Field", etc., all of which can be considerate and detailed, and there is no clumsy place. It can be called a successful work. Mr. Yang's "Morning Park" is a feature. Although it is a small piece, the light and vigorous brushwork, the proper color matching, and the harmony of the air are definitely not something that a high-talent person can have.</p>
<p>Ms. Guan Zilan's paintings are making rapid progress. This time, there are "Portrait" (self-portrait), "Girl", "Still Life", "Flower", etc. Among them, "Still Life" is the best. How much higher is the interest of an apple in the eyes of an appraiser than eating a real apple?</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Baoyi, an old writer who is most famous for his sketch oil paintings, has about ten works this time, all of which show his unique experience. Anyone who has seen his paintings will know that Mr. Chen has reached the pinnacle, such as "After Spring Rain" and "Lake Scenery". I want to wonder how he can describe it. How wonderful is that mountain that makes people drunk? What's more, there is that gorgeous lake water. I have no words to describe it, just say it is mysterious. "Yan Zhi's Sketch" and "Yellow Leaves" are all great. I think Mr. Chen is on par with Mr. Kawagita Kiyoyone and other Japanese painters.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Wang Daoyuan only has one "Racecourse" this time, his painting skills will of course make people recognize it, and I don't need to go into details. You can also see this illustration in the newly published "Pioneer Monthly". The colors are very harmonious and bright.</p>
<p>The works of Mr. Huang Zhenzhong and Mr. Xu Suling are also eye-catching. Mr. Huang's "Miss Ma Lan" is slightly inferior. "Impression of Changsha" takes the suffering of the disaster area as the subject matter and paints the terrifying state of inhumanity. Several lying corpses are set off by the red light of the fire in the distance. At this time, we can imagine the panic of the people in the environment from this picture. Mr. Xu's "Nocturne" can be called a masterpiece. It depicts several friends wandering on the street singing wildly in search of a place to stay. Can a sad person not sympathize with them?</p>
<p>In addition, the "Lakeside" by Fang Ganmin, the "Port of Zhenhai" by Chen Qiucao, the "Twilight" by Du Xueou, and the "Summer of Qingdao" by Pan Sitong all have their own strengths and are more exciting than their previous works.</p>
<p>There are also several writers, such as Weng Yuanchun and Lu Xiaoxia, whose works have their own advantages. I will not go into details one by one.</p>
<p>In short, this exhibition can satisfy the audience in terms of both quality and quantity, and at the same time, it has indeed gained a lot of hints...</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to say is that "in the current era of change, no nation is not struggling and fighting in the competition for survival." Several writers who want to work hard for nationalistic art will surely continue to do so seriously to "promote the nation's will to develop upward in order to form a new life for the nation." I think everyone longs for this. In fact, it is shouldering the greatest mission of art.</p>

<p>Boqian Advertising Agency said that Mr. Zhou Shengyu, a Shanghai merchant, is fond of shadow plays. Considering that the cinemas in various parts of our country show Bo Lai films, and the rights therein are infringed by foreign powers, he went to Nanyang last month to solicit shares and founded a film company at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Luban Road in the French Concession, named Xiong Bai. The internal organization is perfect and the capital is strong. In the future, the film production will be excellent or will be able to recover the rights and interests.</p>
<p>Shanxi Grand Theater announced that there are more than ten male and female actors in the The Western Flourishing Celestial Dance Troupe, each of whom is beautiful and lively. They will perform various fashionable, seductive, romantic, and funny song and dance performances on the first stage of the Shanxi Grand Theater on Shanxi Road, North Shanxi Road, Hai Ning Road, from today. It is expected that there will be many new offerings at that time.</p>

For example, the outline of social science and learning edited by Sun Hanshui, Yang Yinpu's "Yang's Chinese Finance Theory," Zhu Binyuan's "Money and Banking Theory," and Zhang Zhi's "Land Economics," etc., are all famous works that have been praised for a while. Sales are all over three or four editions. Recently, the bureau has set up a general distribution office in Huazhong Bookstore at the intersection of Wangping Street, Zhongshi Road, Simadu, in this port because of the need for business development to set up a store. From April 25th, it will hold a big cheap event jointly with Bizhong Bookstore for one month. Various books are cheaper than the usual prices.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Fudan and Zhonggong Basketball Game <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xi</p>
<p>That day (April 29), we watched the Fudan and Zhonggong basketball competition.</p>
<p>The Fudan team came by car. The players and attendants, together with the cheerleaders, filled three cars. Many female players also came. They were like flowers walking across the playground, which was very attractive. Therefore, there were really a lot of people watching the game that day. All the students of Zhonggong were dispatched, surrounding the small East playground heavily.</p>
<p>Long benches were placed around the court. After the benches were occupied, the later spectators were blocked by the bench railings, and no matter how hard they tried to squeeze in, they could not cross the boundary line. This is the most effortless way to Kkeep line with the audience. I hope that large-scale football games will also use this method to save the flag-wavers from having a hard time chasing the spectators.</p>
<p>The women's friendly match was held first. Fudan players such as Chen Dinghe, He Emei, and Li Lian were all strong women's basketball players. Their heights were taller than those of the Zhonggong team (half of the Zhonggong team were squatty fat men), and their skills were more advanced than those of Zhonggong. Therefore, the result of six to twelve seemed not unexpected.</p>
<p>However, there are also outstanding roles in the Zhonggong team. For example, Zhang Zhaohe is a very promising player. All the six points scored by Zhonggong were thrown by her alone. Of course, she was the most limelight in this competition.</p>
<p>However, the more limelight, the more suffering she suffered. When Miss Zhang was playing vigorously, she slipped and fell to the ground. The rain was wet and the clothes were stained with mud. Everyone laughed, but it is a sign of bravery to fall while playing. There is really no reason to laugh.</p>
<p>But the spectators' unreasonableness is more than this.</p>
<p>For example, when they were holding the ball and throwing it into the blue, the men would shout in a woman's voice Shoo—What does this mean? Also, when the referee has a slightly inappropriate place, they will hiss or call. That is even more pointless.</p>
<p>We spectators can only watch and cannot interfere with the "administration" on the field. It is appropriate to clap your hands or yell a few times to encourage them at the appropriate time. Strange shouts like hooligans making trouble in the theater are out of line.</p>
<p>The Fudan team was led by their sports instructor. The sports instructor is often called "monster" by others. That day, he was wearing a raincoat, a bird-hunting hat on his head, and long black leather boots on his feet. His complexion was the complexion of an American Indian, and his eyebrows were always locked as if he was very sad.</p>
<p>In fact, he was very proud at that time because Fudan was winning.</p>
<p>When the women's basketball stopped, he squatted in front of the female players, making gestures to teach them all kinds of thresholds to defeat the enemy. From a distance, it looked like a mute was kneeling and proposing. The spectators hissed at him and turned around to look around, neither smiling nor scolding, and turned back to continue his Lecture.</p>
<p>"Peter" is always famous for his thick skin, but if you are a physical education teacher, you must have a thick skin, especially if you are a female physical education instructor. Thick skin is an indispensable condition. For example, Liu Liang, who is in our school, is really not young. That day, he was the timer for the men's game. Usually, he would blow the whistle after Haf-tim was over, but he was whimsical and fired a gun, scaring the spectators near him to jump.</p>
<p>In the men's game, Zhonggong won first, and finally Fudan turned defeat into victory, creating a ratio of twenty to twenty-six.</p>
<p>In terms of skills, men are of course much better than women. However, there are also shortcomings in the beauty. Some players often stop for a long time when they catch the ball, without moving forward or dispatching. The opponent does not come forward to snatch it, but just waits for the ball to be released. This kind of "calm" play, although not against the rules, loses a lot of excitement and wastes time. It is not economical. This is my layman's criticism. If there is anything wrong, I hope that you who have studied sports will give me advice.</p>
