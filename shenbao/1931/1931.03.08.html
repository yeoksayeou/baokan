<p>▲李立三被開除黨籍</p>
<p>▲第三國際停發接濟</p>
<p>中國共産黨自一九二八年冬江蘇派與廣東派分化後、蔡和　等被開除黨籍於先、陳獨秀被開除於後、其他重要共黨被開除者、如鄭超羣彭述之尹寛劉伯莊李季陳碧蘭林琳謝莊薛農山等、不計其數失意份子遂另關途徑、各謀出路故一年之間、有所謂「無産者社」「我們的話」「托爾　某東方部」等組織、共黨内幕分崩離析、有三大派十八小派之分、最近第三國際因鑒於中國共産黨内部之分歧、及李立三向忠發等對於中國革命情勢估計不實、一九三零年八月至九月間、</p>
<p>李立三張全國總暴動、紅軍奪取中心城市路綫之下、損失幹部二百餘人、（軍事在外）又其所召集之擴大會議三中全省之决議等、與共黨國際執委及政治主義完全相反、因此第三國際深</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>接要聞</p>
<p>致不滿、並停發僞中共中央之接濟、於是共黨内部大起恐慌、最近乃有　除李立三黨籍之通過並訓令下級、一律嚴厲肅清李立三路稅之殘餘、内部情形、異常複雜據確息、共黨内之智識份子及覺悟靑年莫不異常消極、是中國共産黨末日己至矣、</p>
<p>在經濟落後的中國、根本談不到所謂資本主義、更談不到無産階級、（馬克斯所謂的無産階級、乃是指在大規模的機械組織下的産業勞動者而言、並非如中國一般散漫的無産貧民、他們只能成爲無産者、根本便没有階級的意識、）而一般共産黨徒受了蘇俄的盧布運動、偏要在中國閉着眼睛、瞎喊「無産階級革命、」根本旣没有無産階級、試問何來的階級革命、這算是無的放矢、自欺欺人、結果只把中國弄得死亡枕籍、哀鴻遍野、我想共黨的始祖馬克斯還在、一定要痛哭流涕、痛恨他這般不肖的假子孫的啊、</p>
<p>現在共黨在中國、總算己經到了日暮途窮、奄奄一息、滅亡不過旦夕間事、我把牠解剖起來、便可得出牠自然的結論、現在分作縱横的兩面來說、</p>
<p>（一）縱的方面、可分爲三個時期、（甲）共黨的萌芽時期、此時期約在「五四」運動與「二七」運動之間、其時發起者、爲陳獨秀李大釗諸人、初時不過爲一種學說的研究、其後始有組織當時的活動區域、大都沿平漢路一帶及上海等處此時期在社會上不甚露頭角、僅「二七」一役共黨中的施得杯科議等輩曾一暗中參加活動而己、其餘無甚特别表現、（乙）共黨的興盛時期、此時期即由總理允許加入本黨時期、共黨假借本黨的招牌、與一班靑年農工接近、復施行其狐媚蠱惑的手段、始有長足的發展、本黨北伐勝利彼輩更　其邪說、牢籠靑年、其　　益如普遍肇厚、此時可目爲共黨全盛時期、（丙）共黨的衰亡時期、共黨自加入本黨後、即包贜禍心、受蘇俄的嗾使、隂謀慕奪、然自本黨發現隂謀厲行清黨、以至於今、共黨旣無名器可假、復倒行逆施、變本加厲、其本形日益暴露、民衆莫不深惡痛絶、因之共黨遂漸就没落入於墳墓、此實爲共黨之衰亡時期、</p>
<p>（二）横的方面、約分爲四個時期、（丁）南北的劃分、共黨在創始時、有所謂南陳北李、即南方以陳獨秀爲領袖、北方以李大釗爲代表、此二派的意見雖微有不同、但當時因工作在社會上無重大表現、故亦無甚顯著的劃分、一、統一時期、自李大釗死於北京後、共黨政權遂爲陳獨秀個人所獨攬、爲所欲爲、此即共黨的興盛時期、二、黨團分裂、共黨發展以後、遂有中國共産黨與中國共産主義靑年團之分、黨時團員多係二十以下之靑年、純做共産黨主義的宣傳工作、一切政治活動、則完全在黨的指導之下、自本黨清共以後、共産主義靑年團認爲黨的策略錯誤、遂起而攻擊批評、有時竟單獨活動、不接受黨的命令、此實爲共産黨團分裂之時、三、四分五裂、此時共黨的分裂、最爲複雜、最爲顯著、亦即爲共黨衰亡之象徵、初時有廣東江蘇之分化、以後有工人農人新派舊派之區别、最近更有所謂無産者·我們的話·托爾斯某東方等組織、分崩離析、總計有三大派十八小派之門户、</p>
<p>我們看了上面的解剖、當然可以得出以下的結論、就是（甲）共産主義之在中國是完全違反了馬克斯唯物史觀的信條、而不適於中國的環境、不宜中國的生存（乙）中國的革命、絶對是需要國民革命、只有　本黨領導、才能完成、（丙）中國民衆的痛苦、也只有本黨實現了三民主義、才能解除、（丁）共黨的分化、是必然的結果、也即是滅亡的象徴、（戊）共黨分化以後、進步的依然回到三民主義的路上來、落伍的即與該黨的生命共道墳墓、</p>

<p>▲在馬鞍山附近</p>
<p>▲原因海面大霧</p>
<p>▲船客安全無恙</p>
<p>招商局新昌輪、今次由大連開赴汕頭、在六號夜間、行至吳淞外馬鞍島海面附近、突遇霧露及大風浪、該輪遂罹觸礁之禍、船身套入礁石中、貨艙己有一部裂破、滬局得訊、即謀營救、兹將該輪失事情形、始末狀况、亟爲查誌如後、</p>
<p>失事狀况　新昌輪在大連、裝載大豆及豆餅等三萬担、於本月三日從大連灣開出、直放汕頭起卸、在途尚稱平靖、迨六號下午七時三十分、行至距吳淞口外六十七海里、在大戢山東十二海里馬鞍山之附近地名elliotlslsndl·富魯山時海面有霧、且風浪極大、波濤突起、有一丈而至一丈五尺之高、船身被巨浪簸顚、竟至無法駕駛、富魯山礁石之外、水起旋渦、吸力極大、新昌輪行至該處、爲大副趙石美值班、船身受大風浪之激衝、而乃轟然一聲、即觸入於富魯山礁石之上、輪底套進暗礁、遂致不能行動、</p>
<p>▲觸礁情形　新昌觸礁、在六日下午七時一刻、當時船身被旋渦水吸牽、至不能行動、及至觸撞暗礁、而礁石之套進者、係在該輪之機艙間、海水即隨之侵入、各貨艙底、猶幸未遭觸破、故各貨艙内、</p>
<p>現尚未有海水、但礁石套入船中、船身即不能移動、蓋恐艙底爲礁石劃破也、</p>
<p>▲船主求救　船主沙登sodon、在該輪失事後、急發無綫電ＳＯＳ之求救信號、當塲首先得電者、爲意郵船甘濟號、與江海關之巡艦利津號、意郵船根據海難助救之義務、即派　板三艘、至富魯山礁、營救新昌船員、無如風浪過巨、三　板竟無法前進、遂由利津號巡艦、加派救命船、入海冒險協助、帮同救護、先將船内理貨部分之職員唐日華等二十五名救出、轉交怡和洋行廣生輪帶回上海、</p>
<p>▲滬局救護　上海招商總局、在六號夜中、先接到新昌輪發來報告失事急電、李總辦得報、即命船務科、星夜趕辦營救工作、當時飭令在滬之新豐·廣利·兩輪、生火待發、嗣經考慮之下、以該處風浪巨大、而水流過急、大海輪開往、殊不適宜、恐有危險、遂改雇匯德豐大號拖輪雪浦遜號、携帶機件食物、趕往失事地點救濟、同時又命總船主麥凱納、大副顧久寛、輪機師應孝榮、工程師張耀、並舵工等、即乘該拖輪駛赴失事處察看情形、及指揮救護事宜、</p>
<p>海晏開往　李總辦以新昌輪内、共有船員水手及押貨客商等一百十二名、兹爲愼重船員旅客等生命起見、在救護船出發後、又發電與在途航行、與馬鞍山距離較近之海晏輪、（自温州返滬）及廣大輪（自上海開往汕粤）從速改往該處、加入救護、昨日午後、滬局接得電報、謂海晏輪在下午六時、己經趕抵馬鞍山洋面、正在進行救護工作、江海關利津輪亦己駛抵富魯山附近、協同援救船員矣、</p>
<p>▲船員安全　該輪今次由大連開出、未載旅客、僅有押貨商人五名、全輪船員水手等、除廣生輪先救來上海之理貨部人員盧吉·梁定·麥理保·曹恩·余高等二十五名、己於昨午十一時抵申、到局報告遇險情形後、即經總避將各該人員食宿等事安置就緒、其餘在輪人員、於新昌失事後、有四十餘人、則衆　板至富魯山暫避、昨日、該局續得新昌電報謂全船人員均皆安全、己由利津海晏及雪浦遜等船營救上輪、昨晚或今日、可以全部載回上海矣、</p>
<p>▲責任問題　該輪今次失事、全係霧露及大風浪所致、船主沙登、爲英國籍、在航海界極有經騐而老成謹愼者、服務新昌業十餘年矣、航行南北洋航路、素爲熟習、向未發生錯誤、大二副趙石美·孫卓人、資歷亦甚深、今次觸礁、誠屬天災難測、爲不可抵抗之海難、又據意郵船主言、今兹新昌失事、確非人力所能防禦、又謂、該處海水旋激、加以風浪巨大、較巨之輪、尚難免此意外之海難云云、</p>
<p>▲船身概况　新昌載重二千噸、光　　緒三十一年造、速率每小時十一海里、艙位極佳、船身最堅、爲該局能行香港之唯一優秀船、船價現值八十萬兩、今回暗礁套進機艙、如四十八小時、貨艙内能不浸海水、則尚可營救脫險、惟聞己有一部分貨艙内之豆子、因受水發漲、致將船身裂破、昨日該局又電請海軍部派艦前往保護救護等船、以防海盜刦掠、刻下新昌輪係頂擱在礁石之上、尚未有沉没之兆、</p>
<p>▲電呈國府　南京國民　政府蔣主席鈞鑒、魚晚、忽得新昌輪急電、在吳淞口外馬鞍山附近、因霧觸礁、請求營救、當即電沿岸各輪、馳往救援、並星夜指派航行中距離最近之廣大·海晏·輪折回營救、一面又添雇拖輪、命總船主工程師、率領職員工役、携帶食物衣被、趕往接應、主管職員、一律徹夜工作、現得各方確電報告、全船人員、均經安全起岸、業由怡和廣生輪、先行載回二十五人抵局、其餘各人、亦即晚可到、惟聞船體因載豆及豆餅遇水激漲致裂、查新昌此次赴大連載貨、直航汕頭、在營業上本極有利、船長英人沙登、大副趙石美、均在該輪服務多年、資格極深、經騐甚富、當時並係共同值班、如何遇險、須俟該船長等回局後、始能詳悉、謹先奉聞、餘容續報、職李仲公虞叩、</p>

<p>▲跌價招徠汽油昻貴</p>
<p>▲三月以來停閉五家</p>
<p>▲外商坐收漁人之利</p>
<p>本埠共有出租汽車之公司一百二十餘家、共有出租之汽車一千一百餘輛、同業競爭、向稱劇烈、然未有最近三月之甚者、今則汽車同業鷸蚌相爭、外商汽車公司坐收漁人之利、資本較小者、受競爭影響、己陸續停閉、昨經日日社記者向各方調查所得、分誌如左、</p>
<p>▲競爭起因　全市一百二十餘家出租汽車公司、資本雄厚者、不及半數、較小之公司、大都向各洋行購買汽車時、先付貨價十分之二、其餘八成、按月付償、惟所訂條約、甚爲苛刻、如呈月不能付清期欵者、洋商即須將汽車收回、因此購得汽車之公司、惟一希望爲招徠主顧、發展營業、藉以按月償清前途之貨欵、而跌價招徠、同業競爭之事、從此漸起、</p>
<p>▲漸趨劇烈　去年十一月中旬、因汽油逐步漲價、各公司再事競爭、實難維持、當經出租汽車同業公會籌備會議决二項、（一）勸告各公司停止跌價競爭、（二）出租汽車一律漲價、如送客車價每次一元者、漲價至一元五角、定時車價每小時三元者、漲價至四元、詎此項議决案、少數公司未經履行、而較大之黄汽車公司、亦加入競爭、仍照舊時收價、曾經會員作一度勸告、事未融洽、於是同業公會籌備會常務委員雲飛汽車公司、乃加入戰團、競爭益烈、</p>
<p>▲外人漁利　自去年十二月上旬起、以迄於今、黄汽車公司·雲飛汽車公司·二家、劇烈競爭、至今未己、外商汽油公司、見金價日高、且各汽車公司自相競爭、滬上汽油之銷數、亦日有增加、乃一　漲價、坐收漁人之利、如全滬每月共需汽油之總數、爲五十餘萬加倫、去年每加倫最低之價格爲四角一分、現己漲價至每加倫一元二角五分矣、而出租汽車之代價、小公司雖己漲價、大公司依然如故、營業虧耗、自所難免、</p>
<p>▲陸續停閉　較大之公司、爲競爭營業計、車價依然、較小之公司、因油價步漲、不得不依照同業公會之前項决議案、而實行漲價、然營業清淡、虧耗愈甚、因是三月以來、受競爭影響而停閉之公司、平凉路美利、北四川路華僑·順大、愛多亞路三興·福星·等五家、其餘虧本雖鉅、而勉强維持者、尚有四十餘家、如再事競爭、亦將重受影響、而陸續停閉、</p>
<p>▲最後調停　同業公會籌備會見各會員再事鷸蚌相爭、勢將完全覆没、同受其咎、爲謀挽回同業之存在計、乃决定於最近數日、召集各會員開會討論、作最後之調停、先將車價劃一、議定破壞者之相當處分、然後再謀營業前途之發展、</p>

<p>數目字自一以至十百千萬、皆代表一定之數。呆版確定。無所庸其替代。惟二字不然。時有兩字雙字以及重字再字夾字並字。與之對抗而爭位置、於是二字遂失其統馭之能力焉。習焉不察。固極平常。一經道破。頗饒興趣。例如數鐘點曰。一點鐘。兩點鐘。不聞稱二點鐘。至十二點。却又不可稱十兩點。數人物以箇。唐詩。兩箇黄鸝鳴翠柳。俗諺。兩箇和尚抬水吃。不可稱二箇。人身之兩手兩足兩眉兩目兩耳。兼可稱雙。而獨不可稱二。假如兩手奉獻。而曰二手奉獻。愁鎖雙眉。而曰愁鎖二眉。即爲不詞。稱人則兩夫婦。即兩口子。兩兄弟。兩姊妹。兩姑嫂。兩妯娌。其實皆二人也。稱地則兩河兩江兩湖兩廣兩浙兩蜀兩川。他如蛇之兩頭。馬之兩驂。弓之兩石。艇之兩槳。廟之兩楹。屋之兩廊。衣之兩袖。釵之兩股。物莫能兩大。勢不能兩全。事出兩歧。意存兩可。動則兩失。合則兩傷。凡此皆屬二義。顧絶對不得用二字。國慶十月十日。以二十爲可慶也。乃不曰二十節而稱雙十節。至如九月九日稱重九稱重陽。不稱二九二陽。雙也重也。皆纂二位而代之者也。一二三本天然順數。乃易蒙卦。初筮告。下應曰二三凟。乃曰再三凟。季文子三思而行。孔子應曰二思可矣。乃曰再思可矣。因是二字又被再字侵佔一部分。例如一而再。再而三。如一再籌思。如再三斟酌。如再四叮嚀。以及再生再造再來再度種種。實皆二義也。此與文之三言兩語。酒之三杯兩盞。竹外桃三兩枝。野帆恰受兩三人之以兩替二。如出一轍。蓮有二蒂。名二蒂蓮可也。偏曰並蒂蓮。船有二版。稱二版船可也。偏曰夾版船。若斯之倫。層出不己。二字何不幸而遇此夾纏二耶。</p>

<h3 id="c174">美人魚 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 繫千</p>
<p>這個驚人的消息是發生在五年前一個很小的畢珂哀鄉村中。在市鎭的郊外。靠近海邊。有一爿很小的旅館名盤南地斯。附近的人民。没有一個不知道這旅館裏有二條美人魚。名喬亞盤南地斯。一名吧吧盤南地斯。一天齊而加台（旅館主人的朋友）和他（旅館主人）談論政治。後來獨自坐在家裏。忽然他又回來。並且帶着一個新奇的消息「我看見一條美麗的美人魚。你高興去觀看麽。」於是他們便向目的地趕去。</p>
<p>在一個很清明的月夜。有一部份鄉人。在海岸邊伐木。他們立在吧吧的住處。直到夜將終了的時候。只有大西洋裏水。兀自淙淙的流着。海邊嵌着一叢石頭。「來了。」他們便靜靜的立着。</p>
<p>一分鐘二分鐘的過去。不見什麽。只有倒在水裏的天空。銀色的月亮。只聽得一聲水花饗。於是伊露出在海面了。先見頭部。很長的頭髮。披到肩上。於是露出珍貴的胸部直到那有鱗的尾巴。伊很慢的拳曲伊的尾巴。坐在岩石上。的確是一條美人魚。</p>
<p>他們被這海中水神迷住了。互相談論所見的現象。美人魚聽見了他們的聲音。連忙鑽入水裏。於是又靜情了。</p>
<p>這還是五年前的事情。以後美人魚又發現過好幾次。這個消息傳出以後。有無數人都到這小旅館裏來觀看。一夜伊又來了。並且帶着一個同伴。十分鐘後。伊們互相嬉戲起來。於是小旅館前。好像山隂道上一般。一所新的盤南地斯旅館築成了。這老主人便大獲其利。</p>
<p>那畢珂哀的美人魚爲旅館吸引雇客。有五年之久。一夜一夜的看客站在海邊上。希望見那美麗的怪物。有許多人在夜裏只看見一條有鱗的尾巴。如曇花一現。於是大爲失望。</p>
<p>但是最近偵探出來。吧吧盤南地斯是近代最奇特的騙局。原來這條美人魚是他的女兒。一夜。美人魚正在遊戲給賓客觀看。一隻警船。從港裏潛行出來。美人魚聽了聲音。連忙鑽入水裏。但是警船等待伊們浮出水面時。便一鼓擒之。伊確是主人的女兒坦麗絲。伊的腿上有很精巧的魚尾。穿着一套肉色的游泳衣。伊的朋友是盤南地斯旅館中的待女。</p>
<p>因爲坦麗絲可以併着脚在水裏游泳。像魚兒一樣。這件事情决定的時候。他的妻子瑪萊替伊製造這奇怪的魚尾。於是這新奇的事情便造成了。</p>

<p>客有自六邑歸。爲述匪婦救票事。頗饒興趣。亟記之。以餉讀者。</p>
<p>吾邑素著匪患。匪之患尚不在搶掠。而在擄贖。被擄者。動索鉅萬。小康之家。每致傾産。其無力營救者。匪輒撕票而戮其屍。送諸其門。以爲吝財者戒。其殘忍有如此者。邑有居民某。頗富有。僅一子。新婚之夕。事聞於匪。結夥執械。斬關而入。財物悉被洗掠。尤未饜其所慾。遂綁其愛子以去。事後。索二萬金取贖。某愛子情切。力爲營救。而急切間。鉅欵難籌。匪疑其吝。復不肯折價相就。事遂停滯。匪迭加恫嚇。且函示如翌日不贖。即撕票。某得函。雖驚惶萬狀。顧點金乏術。亦遂付諸浩歎而己。事爲新婦所悉。以夫婿當無生還之望。悲痛之餘。竟以身殉。詎是日深夜。某氏子忽偕一少婦遄歸。神色甚倉皇。某喜出望外。具詢所以。某氏子即指偕來之少婦曰。此兒救命之恩人也。遂詳告遇救之經過。蓋某氏子自入匪窟。匪夥常外出。每留一匪看票。中有女匪。年二十以來。貌頗娟好。時乘間探望。若有深情者然。久之。遂通欵曲。自述爲豫之永城人。亦被匪綁。因索價過奢。無力取贖。遂致陷身於匪。言下欷歔。某氏子心韙其言。竟動相憐之感。而不敢遽信爲眞。姑妄聽之。是夜。婦忽來告。曰。今夜匪夥均應約外出。看票者僅一匪。方熟睡。非君脫難之好機會與。某氏子疑爲剌探。猶未深信。婦曰。時不可失。遂挾之出奔。及脫匪窟。某子氏曰。將何以爲報。婦曰。妾本良家子。寗甘事匪人。今雖幸脫匪窟。亦終無顔歸故鄉矣。君如不棄。願托終身。某氏廉得其情。且悲且喜。悲者子還而媳死。喜者媳死而得媳。嘉其義。遂許之。因懼匪報復。移家他適。不知所之。</p>

<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>花元春一到北京。在飯店裏一住就是十天。北京胡同裏却稱之爲開市。開市的幾天。是客人極力捧塲之日。有許多紅姑娘。開市接連就開了十幾天。至少的限度。也須有三天和酒。像花元春邦樣。是上海來的鼎鼎大名的姑娘。在慶餘堂掛的是第一塊牌子。特地把上房正院讓伊住。而且說明是例不見客。掌班又特爲關照夥計們。須照上海規矩。呼爲六小姐。不是連名搭姓呼爲什麽姑娘。這是完全照了南邊紅姑娘的優待條例辦理的。花元春下車伊始。當然要有一班大爺門給伊鼓吹歡迎。第一個砲仗也要放得響響的。無奈伊的運氣眞不佳。問問上海來的幾位熟客。有的有了别的差使。己經出京去了。有的他們在南來的姑娘中。己有所屬。僅能勉强敷衍。伊指望葉桐侯在一星期内來的。偏偏葉桐侯在上海有事躭擱住子。北京胡同裏請客。不比上海的堂子裏。有什麽拉人碰和。以及買票等種種規矩。什麽條子的車錢。師父的例賞。都由主人家開銷。那種豪放朋友。不大體卹主人家的。一呌就是三四個條子。要是在席的客。都是如此。那律犒賞費。也就很可觀了。再加以來賓的汽車馬車的飯錢。大概請一席酒。總得要三百塊錢。所以找人請客。也不大容易。花元春好容易拉到了三位客人。開市那幾天。連做了三天花頭。在平常的姑娘們。也可以過得去了。無奈那位大肚皮阿金的掌班。震於花老六是上海的紅姑娘。聽說在北京也有熟客。以爲至少總可以連續一禮拜。僅僅只有三天。而且這三天都是敷衍性質。就不免有些失望了。可是也還原諒伊初到北方來。人頭也不十分熟。瞧着那種姑娘。總還是在風頭上。不至於十分走黑的。北京的做客人。同上海稍微有點不同。上海究竟是個大商塲。連嫖堂子的客人。也　一點商業臭味。所以那班張爺李爺。雖然也肯花錢。可是很爲精明。他們在姑娘身上用錢。也要同商業上一樣。適如其分。北京的社會。是個政治社會。政治人物居多數。他們信用了一個主義。竭全神以赴之。好比照呼了一個姑娘。也肯竭全神以赴之。要搏得姑娘歡心。那就肯多花錢。所以北京幾個紅姑娘的做客人。只要擒住了一兩個有力者的客人。餘子碌碌。便不足齒數了。</p>

<p>關於時代靑年社、在最近靑年界所佔有的地位、自有一般的價量、當不容我在此多所贅煩的、這、我們在「時代靑年」週刋上、當可看到了、現在他們如鼓勵靑年學術研究並發表能力起見、特舉行第一次徴文、題爲「時代靑年的幾個重要問題」和「文藝與政治」、前者是討論靑年本身的問題、後者是在當前文藝運動之階段上的檢討、該社並備現金獎勵、第一名爲三十元、第二名二十元、第三名一十元、第四至第十名酌贈書藉文具等紀念品、除歡迎社員投稿外、對於非社員亦在徴求之例、聞現己收到佳作不少、但爲普通計、一時尚未截止、通信處西門大光書店轉云、</p>

<p>— 文</p>
<p>二十七期特大號</p>
<p>大光明書店總發行</p>
<p>靑年的田園、需要靑年自己的勞動力來從事開墾的工程、這種内在的眞實情緒之表現、我們是可以看出靑年界所展露之狀態的整個、同時得以線索到靑年在某種意識和塲合上所以有如是要求之一般、固然、近年來靑年界之分化、多數靑年之陷於没落的途徑、而造成了可怖的局面、實爲靑年間之不能有互信與共信的觀念所致、但也何嘗不是環境的桎梏席捲靑年於彷徨的漩渦的、靑年徘徊在十字街頭、確是靑年意志薄弱的表徴、然而待到歸結究底起來、屢於社會制度之旁繫爲部份、我們該也無可諱言吧、因之、就不免有覺悟的靑年、洞察這種現象、起而爲整個靑年界辯護、一方面指摘現狀之罪惡、他方面復對自身痛下針鍼、企冀一般的覺醒、於是所謂沉默的零圍、從而突破、並足見其由開懇力的總和而展望的坦程、</p>
<p>「時代靑年」我們當然可以說、是這種情態之下的産物了、因爲他們發創的原因和開展、是吻合了上面所說的、他們認識了時代的輪廻所給予靑年之推動的意義、站在時代的分寸上追求充實的生命、由病態的牢籠解放出來、抬頭向光明的境界、</p>
<p>綜計「時代靑年」出版綿續到今、己差不多半載之譜了、我們雖不能說己發生了若何的力量、但就他們努力不懈的一點上、固是靑年界之一種極好的徴象、該值得贊美的、現在自二十七期起、又擴充篇幅了、「因爲我們感覺到篇幅之狹小、未能盡量容納來稿、於是便這樣决定、把原有的篇幅擴充、大體還是承襲前例祇在編製的方面盡編者的能力、逐步改革」、由此實現了「時代靑年」的擴充計劃、那末我們必然能看到進一層的表現、爲靑年自身爭光吧、</p>
<p>眞的、「在無論那一個新的階段上、必歸有一種新的表現之預期的展露、以爲進行之尊循的傾趨、」所以我們在李大椿的新的開塲」上讀到有這樣的一段、</p>
<p>……固然我們始終承認、微弱的力量或許僅等於震顫着的呻吟而己、然而正唯其靑年所處的環境是這樣悲慘的局面、尤其當此大時代的急劇變革期、消沉的暮氣之隂影翦蔽了整個靑年界活躍的氣息、一方面由於歷史的客觀事實之獲得、我們於此更以必然的不能苟安、便進而爲冀企表現我們時代靑年的精神、使我們的心靈把握正軌的安慰、結果、終於從低氣的氛圍之拘約中、抬起我們自己的頭來、向奮鬥的征途上前行、因之、今後主要的旨趣、還是總和在這一方向、我們的探討、不限於狹義的、凡是直接間接影響於靑年本身的問題、我們都需要爲合理的要求之檢討、在靑年運動的理論與實踐上、我們將不放鬆的開闢一條光明的路向、突破沉默和没落的危機、此外、關於其他的、我們也都曾在「發刋詞」上談到、總之、對於忠誠熱血的結晶、自當殷切的接受、予以發表的機令、</p>
<p>……時代的靑年、都應亟來負起一種任務、我們的工程之企求、就是爲整個靑年界的出路着想、那末如果不忘記我們目前所處的地位、所處的時代、我們該不遲疑的把裁培的行事之責任壓上自己的肩頭、</p>
<p>誠然、過去的「時代靑年、」在靑年運動的理論與實踐上、有了很多的探討的、始最近期上之豪吾的「時代靑年與民族運動、」把時代靑年與民族運動所維擊的機構發揮得非常盡致、次如李椿森的「二○年的開始與中國靑年運動的展望、」更明白的標幟了進行的綱領、這些在讀者諒很知道吧、在這一期上、又有一篇值得注意的文字、就是朱劍白的「靑年與政治、」這問題似乎是廣泛的、可是經作者分節的說明、使我們瞭然的認識靑年與政治的關係了、這也是屢於討論靑年運動的文字、蓋靑年運動之努力實際、即爲直接參加政治的行動、則今日靑年運動之應否直接參與政治的行動、要爲值得詳加檢討的問題、作者首把什麽是靑年、什麽是政治、二大前提解决、在政治與靑年的標題上、說明政治與靑年的受教育問題、政治與靑年的出路問題、政治與靑年的活動問題、在靑年與政治的標題上、說明靑年與政治現狀、靑年與政治革命、靑年與政治思想、靑年與政治活動、至於作者的結論是說、「臨了、我們須知靑年與政治有不可分離的關係、靑年不過問政治、政治會來干涉靑年一切政治現狀、更有待於靑年之改進、故靑年之應努力政治活動、在原則上、無可非議、惟是靑年如其錯認了政治思想、便會錯走了政治活動的路、此則不可不注意的、尤其當這訓政時期的靑年、破壞的工作己經過去建設的責任正侍負擔、在實際上、對在學靑年的直接作政治活動、不得不加以限制、這正與在學靑年以充分準備的機會、是積極的意旨、不是消極的辦法、……」這是有力的見解、我們應注意的、</p>
<p>此外、尚有敬齊的「資本主義下的現代婦女之地及其應有之自覺、一鐵君的「收回上海租界與革命外交之瞻望、一椿的「變革期中失學危機的救濟、」默之的「靑年與讀書會、」洛湘的「感想錄、」啓芸的「考試塲中」一文草的小說「啞老」等、都是以靑年忠誠的思構來寫作的、一學校無線電」是報告各學校的消　、我們看了、會有一種說不出的味道、像這樣的編製、是益增時代靑年的推進力吧、</p>

<p>In the past few days, the world has seen many optimistic signs. However, the so-called optimism only shows the possibility of optimism, without truly reaching the realm of optimism. Whether or not disarmament is successful depends on the outcome of the next International Disarmament Conference, and the Disarmament Conference is still in the process of sending letters requesting the dispatch of representatives. The Anglo-Indian issue has only achieved a preliminary solution, and the radical faction of the Indian National Congress has shown signs of division. The internal situation in India cannot yet be said to be optimistic. Although the American silver market has shown some improvement, silver prices are still fluctuating and unstable, and the situation in the past few days cannot be used to predict the future situation. Moreover, there is currently no turnaround hope in the American economy. Today's American telegram said that the turnaround after a long period of decline must be slow. This is not only true for the United States, but also for other countries. Therefore, from today's economic perspective, it is not easy to be optimistic. Furthermore, from the political perspective, the political situation in various countries is not yet stable. According to the news received today, a new revolution has broken out in the capital of Portugal due to opposition to the current ruling government. Turkey has dissolved its parliament and reconvened it, and new disturbances have arisen between the parties. Peru's fourth revolution in nearly seven months, although its government is scheduled to be established today, it is impossible to predict how long it will last. In short, in today's world, at this time of economic depression and difficult living conditions, various problems are prone to disputes. The deteriorating situation in both politics and society is difficult to reverse and return to stability. How can the efforts and awareness of a few people save this general trend?</p>

<p>(Taiyuan) The Provincial Government telegraphed the Central Government on the 6th, saying that since the military rise in Shanxi in the 15th year of the Republic, opium has not been completely eliminated, and Jindan and Liaomian have taken the opportunity to come in. The import of these drugs not only affects the national economy, but also concerns the survival of the race. According to the opium prohibition law promulgated by the government, the sentence should not exceed five years and the fine should be limited to 5,000 yuan. Offenders have a chance to survive and it is difficult to suppress their desire to commit the crime again after serving their sentence. Where there is great profit, the stricter the prohibition, the more ingenious the methods of manufacturing and selling. Good people take risks by chance, and the government's intelligence is exhausted. If the punishment is not increased, there is no effective remedy. It is proposed to approve the formulation of a separate law that imposes the death penalty on those who traffic and manufacture more severely, and to order the expulsion of those with addictions among the staff and students of various agencies and schools.

<p>▲ National, Bombay, 6th - Leftists in the National Movement disagree with Gandhi, fearing it will lead to a split within the Indian autonomy faction. Today, Nehru publicly stated that Gandhi's solution with the Indian Governor-General is tantamount to Gandhi's complete capitulation.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 6th - Conservative Party member Baldwin stated in a speech in Newton tonight, clarifying the Conservative Party's attitude towards India and Indian affairs. He said that some people seem to hold the view that he, as the leader of the Conservative Party, is adopting a policy of abandoning India and succumbing to India. In fact, this accusation is completely unfounded and is merely a pretext for his enemies to attack him. He and his loyal Conservative comrades absolutely do not want to weaken the connection between Britain and India in the slightest, and are willing to promote an even closer connection between them than before. India does not only refer to radical agitators, but also to hundreds of millions of well-meaning Indians. We should use all legitimate methods to cooperate with the Indians and create a political system suitable for India's future needs. At the same time, the Conservative Party is also very willing to assist the Indian government in maintaining order. The Conservative Party should not be divided by the Indian issue, but should be more united because of it, he said.</p>

<p>▲ Closing Situation The National Commercial Transportation Conference held its closing ceremony at 3:00 PM on the 7th. 103 representatives attended. Chairman Sun Ke reported on the process and significance of the conference, stating that the conference had been very successful and much appreciated. The purpose of this conference was to gather specialized talents, pool wisdom, and study various issues related to commercial transportation in order to achieve thorough improvement. In the future, the government and the people should work together to eliminate various long-standing problems. It is especially important to implement the resolutions of various cases, he said. Representatives Wang Jianzhong and Hong Shaofu then spoke, and the amended declaration was then dismissed.</p>
<p>▲ Declaration Released The National Commercial Transportation Conference issued the following declaration at its closing today: "After the unification of the National Government, railway transportation became the lifeblood of the country. A special department was established to manage its affairs. Due to the unstable situation, many things were constrained. Although there was talk of reform, there was no thorough planning. Recently, with the end of military affairs and the central government's credibility becoming increasingly consolidated, the Ministry of Railways took the opportunity to govern, creating the initiative to convene a National Commercial Transportation Conference. As a result, more than 150 people, including representatives from provincial and municipal governments, local chambers of commerce, railway administrations, experts, and celebrities, enthusiastically came to the meeting. In the discussion field, they were able to prioritize the interests of the country and the well-being of the people, speaking openly and honestly, and saying everything they knew. Regarding transportation equipment, they strived to expand based on the actual needs; regarding the social economy, they strived to supplement and inject based on the supply and demand of materials; regarding the accumulated problems of the railways, they consulted extensively to achieve reform; regarding railway freight rates, they considered comprehensively to achieve fairness. As a result, more than 160 important proposals were resolved within a week. In the past, warlords divided and occupied territories, regarding the railways as a source of profit, arbitrarily fighting, destroying vehicles and roads, and committing all kinds of evils. Successive generations made things worse. As a result, railway equipment became increasingly dilapidated, and railway management became increasingly corrupt. Goods accumulated, travelers sighed, and public and private sectors were exhausted and in pain. No one dared to lightly criticize its faults or advocate for reform. Now, the Ministry of Railways resolutely and decisively reversed the actions of the past, convened the conference, and promoted the spirit of cooperation between the road and merchants, seeking to eliminate the isolation of both parties, and working together to revitalize road administration and develop commercial transportation. Representatives from all parties arose in response, and the satisfactory results were beyond what was initially expected. Now that the conference has concluded, the proposals have been resolved, and the consultations are unanimous. It is hoped that colleagues will wholeheartedly support and implement them from beginning to end, without harboring the thought that things will pass with time, so that the resolved cases can be implemented as soon as possible. This is our hope, and we hereby declare."</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Last Days of the Chinese Communist Party <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲ Li Lisan Expelled from the Party</p>
<p>▲ The Third International Stops Providing Aid</p>
<p>Since the split between the Jiangsu and Guangdong factions of the Chinese Communist Party in the winter of 1928, Cai Hesen and others were expelled from the party earlier, and Chen Duxiu was expelled later. Countless other important Communist Party members were expelled, such as Zheng Chaoqun, Peng Shuzhi, Yin Kuan, Liu Bozhuang, Li Ji, Chen Bilan, Lin Lin, Xie Zhuang, and Xue Nongshan. Disappointed individuals then sought other paths and sought their own way out. Therefore, within a year, there were organizations such as the "Proletariat Society," "Our Words," and "Tolstoy's Oriental Department." The internal affairs of the Communist Party were disintegrating, with divisions into three major factions and eighteen minor factions. Recently, the Third International, in view of the internal divisions of the Chinese Communist Party and Li Lisan's and Xiang Zhongfa's inaccurate assessment of the Chinese revolutionary situation, from August to September 1930,</p>
<p>Under Li Lisan's route of a general national uprising and the Red Army seizing central cities, more than 200 cadres were lost (excluding military personnel). Furthermore, the resolutions of the enlarged meeting of the Third Central Committee and the provincial resolutions were completely contrary to the Communist Party International Executive Committee and political doctrines. Therefore, the Third International deeply</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Important News in Brief</p>
<p>Expressed dissatisfaction and stopped providing aid to the pseudo-Chinese Communist Central Committee. As a result, there was great panic within the Communist Party. Recently, the expulsion of Li Lisan from the party was passed and instructions were issued to lower levels to strictly eliminate the remnants of Li Lisan's road tax. The internal situation is extremely complicated. According to reliable sources, intellectuals and awakened youth within the Communist Party are all extremely passive. The last days of the Chinese Communist Party have arrived.</p>
<p>In economically backward China, there is no basis to talk about so-called capitalism, let alone the proletariat. (The proletariat referred to by Marx refers to industrial laborers under large-scale mechanical organizations, not scattered proletarian paupers like those in China. They can only become proletarians and have no class consciousness at all.) However, the general Communist Party members, influenced by the ruble movement of Soviet Russia, insist on closing their eyes and shouting "proletarian revolution" in China. There is fundamentally no proletariat, so how can there be a class revolution? This is like shooting at nothing, deceiving oneself and others. As a result, China is filled with death and misery. I think even the founder of the Communist Party, Marx, would cry bitterly and hate these unfilial pseudo-descendants.</p>
<p>Now, the Communist Party in China has finally reached the end of its road, gasping for breath. Its demise is only a matter of time. If we dissect it, we can arrive at its natural conclusion. Now, let's look at it from two aspects, vertical and horizontal:</p>
<p>(1) Vertically, it can be divided into three periods: (A) The embryonic period of the Communist Party. This period was approximately between the "May Fourth" Movement and the "February 7th" Movement. At that time, the initiators were Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, and others. Initially, it was just a study of a certain theory. Later, organizations began to form. The activity area at that time was mostly along the Pinghan Railway and in Shanghai. During this period, it did not show up much in society. Only in the "February 7th" incident did people like Shi Debai and Keyi secretly participate in activities. There was not much special performance otherwise. (B) The prosperous period of the Communist Party. This period began when the Premier allowed them to join this party. The Communist Party borrowed the signboard of this party and approached a group of young peasants and workers. Then, they used their fox-like and bewitching methods, and began to develop significantly. After the victory of the Northern Expedition of this party, they further promoted their heresies and imprisoned the youth. Their influence spread more and more widely. This time can be regarded as the peak period of the Communist Party. (C) The decline period of the Communist Party. Since the Communist Party joined this party, it harbored sinister intentions and, instigated by Soviet Russia, secretly plotted to usurp power. However, since this party discovered the conspiracy and vigorously carried out the party purge until now, the Communist Party had no name to borrow, acted perversely, and intensified its actions. Its true form was increasingly exposed, and the people deeply hated it. As a result, the Communist Party gradually declined and entered its grave. This is indeed the period of decline of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(2) Horizontally, it can be roughly divided into four periods: (D) The North-South division. At the beginning of the Communist Party, there were so-called South Chen and North Li, that is, Chen Duxiu in the south as the leader, and Li Dazhao in the north as the representative. Although these two factions had slightly different opinions, there was no significant performance in society at that time, so there was no significant division. E. The unification period. After Li Dazhao died in Beijing, the Communist Party's power was monopolized by Chen Duxiu, who did whatever he wanted. This was the prosperous period of the Communist Party. F. The party-group split. After the development of the Communist Party, there was a distinction between the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Youth League. At the time, most of the League members were youths under the age of twenty, who purely engaged in the propaganda work of Communist Party ideology. All political activities were completely under the guidance of the Party. After this party purged the Communists, the Communist Youth League believed that the party's strategy was wrong, so they rose up to attack and criticize, and sometimes even acted independently, without accepting the party's orders. This was indeed the time of the Communist Party-League split. G. Disintegration. At this time, the split of the Communist Party was the most complex, the most significant, and the most indicative of the decline of the Communist Party. Initially, there was a division between Guangdong and Jiangsu. Later, there was a distinction between workers, peasants, new factions, and old factions. Recently, there have been organizations such as the so-called "Proletariat," "Our Words," and "Tolstoy's Oriental Department," which have disintegrated. In total, there are three major factions and eighteen minor factions.</p>
<p>After looking at the above analysis, we can naturally come to the following conclusions: (A) Communism in China is completely contrary to Marx's historical materialism and is not suitable for China's environment and survival. (B) The revolution in China absolutely needs a national revolution, and only the leadership of this party can complete it. (C) The suffering of the Chinese people can only be relieved by this party's realization of the Three Principles of the People. (D) The disintegration of the Communist Party is an inevitable result and a symbol of its demise. (E) After the disintegration of the Communist Party, the progressive elements will still return to the path of the Three Principles of the People, and the backward elements will share the grave with the life of that party.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Jinan Municipal Government Restored <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Han Fuju, previously issued a clear order on January 6 to abolish the municipal government because the Shandong Provincial Government was facing financial difficulties after the abolition of likin taxes and because Mayor Chen Weixin was mismanaging affairs. All affairs were merged into the provincial government. Subsequently, the Social Affairs Bureau was also abolished. The remaining four bureaus of the Jinan Municipal Government, namely the Education Bureau, Finance Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and Public Security Bureau, were directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government and were presided over by Xing Lantian, a member of the receiving municipal government committee and a member of the provincial government. The Municipal Public Security Bureau had even been renamed the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. However, Jinan's establishment as a municipality was stipulated by the central government and could not be abolished by a provincial order. Moreover, in the two months since the municipal government was abolished, frequent diplomatic events and municipal affairs had become increasingly numerous, and it was felt that the restoration of the Jinan Municipal Government was indeed necessary. Today (the 5th), the provincial government issued an order appointing Wen Chenglie as the mayor of Jinan, instructing him to quickly organize the municipal government in order to promote progress. Currently, Xing Lantian is preparing to hand over affairs. Mr. Wen has requested that the original site of the municipal government be vacated, as it is currently occupied by a pistol brigade. On one hand, he is asking them to move, and on the other hand, he will first work in the public property liquidation office starting tomorrow (the 6th). He will also recall the former members of the municipal government for employment. The four bureaus of public security, finance, education, and public works will still be directly under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, and the Social Affairs Bureau will also be restored. A Health Bureau will also be established. The instruction from the provincial government is recorded below: "To order compliance. It is found that due to the daily decline in revenue and poor management in Jinan City, an explicit order was previously issued to merge with this government, and personnel were sent to receive affairs. Recently, after assessing the situation, diplomatic events have become more frequent and municipal affairs have become more numerous. If there is no responsible agency, progress will inevitably be delayed. It is appropriate to restore the Jinan Municipal Government in order to promote development. Apart from issuing a separate letter of appointment, and notifying the original receiving personnel to hand over each item, it is ordered that the mayor immediately comply, quickly organize the municipal government, and report the date of arrival, the situation of receiving affairs, along with a resume, for reference."

<h3 id="e80">Shandong Province Releases Large Batch of Military Prisoners <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲ Personally Decided by Han Fuju</p>
<p>▲ Total of Forty-Eight Prisoners Released</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, believes that there are many military prisoners detained in the province's First and Fifth Prisons. Now that the central government is holding a general amnesty, these prisoners should also be given a chance to rehabilitate themselves to show leniency. He specially consulted with Wu Zhenzuan, the president of the High Court, and sent Lin Kaitai, the director of military law from the Third Route Army Headquarters, to assist Liu Yaokun, the warden of the First Prison, and Wang Kerang, the warden of the Fifth Prison, in separately interrogating the military prisoners in the two prisons. Today (the 4th) was the day when Han Fuju routinely interrogated cases in the provincial government. At around 1:00 PM, personnel from the First and Fifth Prisons, along with Lin Kaitai, the director of military law from the Third Route Army, escorted all the military prisoners under interrogation to the provincial government, totaling twenty-one from the First Prison and twenty-nine from the Fifth Prison. Han interrogated each of them one by one. As a result, with the exception of Zhang Guanwu and Zhang Laoba from the First Prison, whose circumstances were more serious and who would remain imprisoned, all the other prisoners were released. A group photo was taken of all the released prisoners next to the provincial government auditorium. The list of those released from the First Prison includes Wang Qishan, Tang Xingwu, You Zhentang, Su Laiyuan, Cao Anting, Wang Haiquan, Zhang Chengzhai, Yang Xiaoshan, Su Jiyuan, Gao Zhenling, Hou Desheng, Zhang Xiaowu, Cai Yutang, Xiao Jizhou, Zhao Zibi, Zhao Wende, Li Zhongshan, Mei Guangxiu, and Li Xunshan, totaling nineteen people. The list of those released from the Fifth Prison includes Shen Baoyi, Yan Xiangchen, Han Jituan, Ma Zefen, Yang Qinglin, Meng Xianzhang, Zhang Xuechun, Li Xingyao, Wang Fengxiang, Liu Zhongfu, Liu Zhongcai, Guo Jingqi, Cao Bingong, Xu Desheng, Li Dechang, Wang Desheng, Yang Shoushen, Jiang Mingyuan, Wang Bingchen, Liu Xinti, Zhou Fengxiang, Zhao Hongen, Yang Yulin, Wei Bingwen, Zou Damei, Li Desheng, Gao Shen, Li Fusheng, and Wang Yunhui, totaling twenty-nine people. After releasing all the military prisoners, Han continued to interrogate other cases. In addition to various drug addicts, there was also the case of Zhao Xingwu, the magistrate of Jiaxiang County, beating a prison guard, which was ordered to be transferred to the court for investigation. In addition, two people were shot, one was Ni Shixun, 22 years old, from Licheng, who forged the Finance Bureau's five-day donation tickets for large vehicles and sold them in Duandian, and the other was Wang Changhui, 39 years old, from Tangyi, who privately manufactured counterfeit silver coins and drugs. Twenty-eight counterfeit silver coins and drug-making machinery were found in his home. According to the current criminal law, the crimes of these two were not punishable by death, but Han actually sentenced them to death, which shows his severity. (March 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Completion of Troop Reorganization Amidst Disturbances in Shanxi <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>▲ Over Two Thousand Soldiers Disbanded from Jin-Sui Army</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Recently, due to issues with troop reorganization and military pay in Shanxi Province, with the Northeast indicating an inability to take responsibility, garrisons in various locations have repeatedly staged mutinies, creating an atmosphere of considerable unrest. Regarding the mutinies, the troops of Yang Xiaoou stationed in Changzhi County and a certain unit stationed in Mengcheng had already initiated such actions. Recently, more than two hundred soldiers from Yang Yaofang's troops stationed in Qixian County also deserted with their weapons. While ostensibly escaping, it was actually an open act. The city was initially slightly chaotic, but order was quickly restored through suppression by a large force. Additionally, several cavalry companies of Zhao Chengshou's troops in Datong also mutinied, causing significant alarm among the populace. Regarding military expenditure, it was generally believed that the Northeast would temporarily provide funds after the reorganization. However, with the Northeast's implicit refusal, the Shanxi garrison is currently trapped in a predicament. This matter is closely linked to the mutinies, and unless it is resolved soon, the future of Shanxi remains uncertain. The recent mutiny of Yang's troops and the troop reorganization situation are detailed below:</p>
<p>▲ The Truth About the Yang Troops' Mutiny: One division of Yang Xiaoou's army stationed in Luan (i.e., Changzhi County) suddenly mutinied at 2:00 AM on February 27th. During the initial phase, the provincial wireless station received a report stating that the mutiny was initiated by Zhou's regiment, comprising about a division's worth of troops, who were attacking the city from outside. Subsequently, communication lines in Luan were blocked by stationed troops. The provincial radio station repeatedly inquired but received no further reports, making it difficult to ascertain the true situation. Yang's forces consist of a total of three divisions. Currently, Yang is ordering the remaining two divisions to suppress the mutiny. After hearing the news, Shang Zhen and Xu Yongchang convened an emergency military conference in the provincial capital to discuss countermeasures. In the past two days, reconnaissance flights were dispatched to investigate. Yesterday, Zhou Tulian, Director of the Military Reorganization Committee's Assessment Office, was also sent with several military police to conduct a detailed investigation. The reasons for the mutiny are attributed to unfair distribution of pay and opposition to the reorganization. According to Yang Xiaoou's telegram from Changzhi, a segment of his troops on the 27th, while pursuing soldiers who were deserting with weapons, accidentally triggered a misunderstanding leading to mutual fire between those inside and outside the city gates, which was quelled by dawn.</p>
<p>▲ Completion of Troop Inspection of Sun, Pang, and Song's Units: Fu Zhan Kui returned to Bingzhou from Yuncheng the other day. According to Fu, regarding the inspection of the various troops, he stated that since his arrival in Bingzhou, he has been actively engaged in inspections. As of now, the inspection of Sun, Song, and Pang's units has been completed. During this inspection, attention was paid to the strength of the soldiers, the quality of firearms, the number of mules and horses, and the quantity of military supplies. The inspection results indicate that the troops of Sun, Song, and Pang are now standardized. However, many lack sufficient firearms, which is a reality. It is understood that Fu's mission was to inspect these three units. After completing the inspection of these three units, Fu received a telegram from the Northeast, ordering him to continue inspecting the Jin-Sui armies. Therefore, Fu is currently remaining in Bingzhou.</p>
<p>▲ Recent Situation of Shanxi Military Reorganization: The Liquidation Committee was formally established yesterday (the 1st) and its seal has been put into use. The various offices under the General Staff Department of the original headquarters have been reorganized into groups, handling matters as before. Regarding troop reorganization, in addition to the already completed reorganization of the troops of Sun Chu, Li Fuying, and Feng Pengzhu, the army of Wang Jingguo has also been reorganized, with a total reduction of over four hundred officers and over three thousand soldiers. After deducting the replacement of vacancies in various units after the war, the actual reduction was only over two thousand soldiers. The roster of officers has been brought here in preparation for transfer to the training corps. Sun Chu, anticipating the imminent inspection of his troops, went to Yuci at 12:00 AM yesterday to address all the officers, explaining the significance of this reorganization and the responsibilities of soldiers. Funding for the reorganization remains unresolved. In addition to sending Jing Yaoyue to Shenyang to personally petition Zhang Xueliang, they plan to jointly telegraph urging the issuance of funds within the next few days. (March 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Wu Tiecheng Discusses Party Affairs in the Northeast <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Wu Tiecheng, a Central Committee member specially appointed to inspect Party affairs in the Northeast, arrived in Shenyang on the 20th of last month. He initially resided at the Lingge Hotel on Sanjing Road in the business district. Later, for convenience in external liaison, he moved his office to Fuhou Lane on Yijing Road. Believing that Wu's arrival in the East is of utmost importance to the progress of Party affairs in the Northeast, I paid him a visit on the afternoon of the 1st. I was received and had the following conversation with Mr. Wu: (Question) In addition to inspecting Party affairs in the Northeast, do you have any other missions? (Answer) I was ordered by the Central Committee to inspect the status of Party affairs in the provinces of the Northeast. However, Party affairs in the Northeast are currently not yet sound, so I urgently need to jointly consult with the authorities of the provinces of the Northeast to promote methods. Other than this, I have no other mission. (Question) May I ask about the steps to promote Party affairs in the Northeast? (Answer) The Central Committee has scheduled the National Assembly to be held, and representatives to the National Assembly must be elected by local mass organizations. To be cautious about this election, it is necessary to first make the organizations of local mass groups sound. Now, taking Liaoning Province as an example, the organizations of various mass groups, such as the Provincial Education Association, Agricultural Association, and General Chamber of Commerce, are mostly not legal in organization. They must be reorganized in accordance with the organizational law stipulated by the Central Committee. Other groups that have not yet been organized should also be formed. However, the formation of various mass groups must be carried out under the guidance of the Provincial Party Headquarters. Therefore, the only important task now is to actively establish the Provincial Guiding Committees in the provinces of the Northeast. Regarding this point, I have consulted with Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang several times, and a method has been decided. It is planned to establish the Liaoning Provincial Party Affairs Guiding Committee as soon as possible, and the three provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe will also be established in turn. After the establishment of the Provincial Party Guiding Committees, they will guide the formation of local mass organizations, submit them to the Central Committee for filing, and after approval by the Central Committee, the election of representatives to the National Assembly will be held. (Question) As you said, there are still many procedures. The National Assembly is not far away. Can it be done in time? (Answer) By actively organizing in order, it can certainly be done in time. Now, in Liaoning and Ningxia Province, Mr. Zhu Guangmu and Mr. Peng Zhiyun have been appointed by Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang to prepare everything. It is estimated that the Liaoning Provincial Party Guiding Committee can be established by the middle of this month at the latest. After its establishment, I will go to the three provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe to jointly carry out everything. I have now sent personnel to these provinces in advance to consult with the authorities in advance in order to be agile. As for the various local mass groups, they can all be legally organized by the middle of April at the latest. In short, no matter what, the session of the National Assembly has been decided and will not be changed, and Party affairs in the Northeast must be completed before the session of the National Assembly. (Question) Are there any changes to the selection and number of Liaoning Provincial Guiding Committee members from those previously appointed by order? How is the funding determined? (Answer) The number of Liaoning Provincial Party Affairs Guiding Committee members is still seven, and the candidates are still the same as those appointed by the Central Committee in the eighteenth year of the Republic. (According to the Liaoning and Ningxia Provincial Party Affairs Guiding Committee candidates, they were clearly appointed by the Central Committee in the eighteenth year of the Republic as Zhang Xueliang, Peng Jiqun, Xu Shida, Kang Mingzhen, Li Shaoyuan, Wang Shuchang, Wu Junpei, and other seven people.) As for the funding, it has not yet been agreed upon. The method of payment is to be allocated from the provincial treasury under the heading to be turned over to the national treasury. (Question) When do you plan to return to Nanjing? (Answer) I plan to return to Nanjing during the session of the National Assembly. (Question) It is heard that the county party headquarters in Hebei Province will all be restored. Is that true? (Answer) It will indeed be restored. The Central Committee, because Hebei has suffered from the destruction of reactionary forces, and the party affairs in various counties and cities have been abandoned for a long time, and the party members are also scattered and difficult to verify, urgently wants to reorganize them. The first step will start with identifying the party membership of party members in various counties and cities. Mr. Zhang Puquan is currently discussing with the local authorities in Ping. (Question) Japanese newspapers reported that the Central Committee will send Mr. Chen Youren north to take charge of diplomacy in the Northeast. Is this saying true? (Answer) When I was in Nanjing, I had not heard of this saying. It is probably not accurate. At this point, other guests came to visit, so I excused myself and left. (March 2nd)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e83">Suzhou <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Thorough Investigation of the Construction Bureau's Embezzlement Case: The old copper coin bureau in Panmen, after ceasing operations, was reorganized into a provincial model silk weaving factory. A large number of machines and over a hundred rooms remained. The Construction Bureau sent personnel to manage it. Recently, the provincial government allocated the site to the Higher Court to rebuild the Jiangsu Provincial Reformatory, and construction is imminent. The Construction Bureau sent Commissioner Lin Zaojian to Suzhou to supervise the handover of the premises and seal up the machines. Suddenly, a worker named Lu Aqi (formerly an errand runner at the Construction Bureau, now a laborer in the road maintenance engineering team) informed that the wooden shoulder poles used by the urban and rural telephone system and the wooden stakes used for surveying during the tenure of former Construction Bureau Chief Wei Zumo (Wei recently handed over the premises without officially handing them over to the new chief) were made by dismantling old materials from the factory, and there were signs of illegal sale. He also suspected that some of the machines were missing. Lin returned to the province to report. On the 6th, the Bureau sent Second Section Chief Tang Jianzhong to Suzhou to join Magistrate Huang in summoning Zhou Zuxi (from Kunshan, father of former Bureau Chief Wei's wife), who was the former director of general affairs at the Construction Bureau, Gu Wenhua and Lu Yuchu, the caretakers of the site, Zhou Shuifu, a carpenter who had made the wooden shoulder poles and wooden stakes, Yu Lian, the site's cook, and the informer Lu Aqi, to the county government for questioning. They were secretly interrogated for seven hours that night. According to Lu, in the autumn of the year before last, Mr. Gu instructed him to hire a Jiangbei boat, at the expense of Mr. Zhou, to dismantle and transport over four hundred pieces of pine planks to Kunshan, Si Tiao Li, etc. Zhou and others denied this, claiming it was a false accusation. As a result, several people, including Zhou, were sent to the Public Security Bureau for detention. Zhou Shuifu and Lu Yuchu were released on bail. Yesterday (the 7th), the Public Security Bureau secretly interrogated all the witnesses again. It is rumored that many people are involved. Currently, Construction Bureau Commissioner Lin has gone to Kunshan to investigate. Meanwhile, Commissioner Tang has telegraphed the Bureau for instructions.</p>
<p>Funds for Dredging Songjiang River Transferred to Public Security Expenses Approved: After the provincial order notified a reduction of three thousand yuan per month in the public security subsidy fee of the Public Security Bureau here, the county government invited various groups and local figures to discuss and decide to offset the remaining twelve thousand yuan of Songjiang dredging fees. After submitting it to the provincial government for approval, the county government received instructions from the Civil Affairs Department yesterday (the 7th), approving the use of the Songjiang dredging fees to borrow for the insufficient public security fees for this year. However, in the next year's budget, this borrowed Songjiang dredging fee should be listed in the provincial repayment.</p>
<p>Robbery Occurs in Broad Daylight on Xijin Bridge: At the house of Zhang Yiliang, a farmer from Shimutou Village on Xijin Bridge outside Changmen, at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, twelve or thirteen robbers suddenly arrived, all armed with handguns, and robbed over a hundred silver dollars before escaping in the direction of Huguan.</p>
<p>Appeals for Splashing Quicklime to Blind Wife: Lu Mugen, a villager from Shen Dianqiao Village outside Qimen, because he disliked his wife Lu Wang's ugliness, poured quicklime into Lu Wang's eyes on the 28th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar last year, blinding both of Lu Wang's eyes. Lu Wang immediately went to the Wu County Local Court in the city to verify the injuries. After the prosecutor's investigation and prosecution, the criminal court concluded the trial and sentenced him to three years of imprisonment. Lu Mugen was dissatisfied with the sentence and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday afternoon (the 7th), Judge Li of the Second Criminal Court held a hearing and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>

<p>Progress on the Construction of the Circum-Lake Road: The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments decided to build a circum-lake road in various counties along Taihu Lake in the two provinces and planned to build two major projects along the lake: (1) opening a national park in Xishan, Dongting; (2) building a long causeway between the east and west mountains to connect them. It is expected that the above points will be implemented in a short period of time. The Jiangsu Construction Department has formulated a specific plan to complete a part of it this year, and it has been stipulated that the entire road be divided into seven sections for construction: (1) from Yixing to Fenshuidun, a total length of sixty li; (2) from Fenshuidun to Wuxi City, a total length of fifty-five li; (3) from Wuxi City along the Shanghai-Nanjing Road to Guangfu Town, a total length of seventy li; (4) from Guangfu Town to Suzhou, a total length of forty-five li; (5) from Suzhou along the canal to Bazhe Town, a length of fifty li; (6) from Bazhe Town to Shenjiaqiao, the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, a total length of fifty-five li; (7) another section from Muzhe Town to Houshan Town, a total length of sixty li. The above seven sections have a total length of three hundred and ninety-five li. The project is estimated to cost 1,975,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Rushing to Handle the Election of the People's Congress: The Wuxi County Government was ordered to prepare for the election of the National Assembly. The Election Supervisor, Pan Zhijia, convened representatives of various groups to meet and decide to rush to prepare. However, because the various groups reported detailed household registration books, they were submitted for review, and it was stipulated that the deadline was five days. In fact, it was extremely difficult to complete. They telegraphed the province to request an extension, but the Civil Affairs Department replied that it was not allowed. Therefore, they repeatedly urged the various groups to rush to complete the work overnight. Yesterday, a special commissioner was dispatched to submit the books of the labor union, chamber of commerce, industry groups, shipping guilds, etc. to the Civil Affairs Department first, and other groups will submit them later. However, the agricultural association and the education association have just received the organizational charter, and they must be reorganized before they can create a roster, submit it for review, which is extremely difficult in fact. Therefore, they hesitated a lot.</p>
<p>The Truth About the False Robbery Case: Zhu Guangxin, a policeman from the third sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, is currently serving as a learning policeman in the second sub-bureau. When he was in Nanmen, he became acquainted with a Jingjiang woman, Liu Wang. Recently, she had an affair with Gu Hongquan, the brother-in-law who opened the Yichang Silk Factory, and gradually became estranged from Zhu. Recently, Zhu was dismissed from his job due to an incident. He was not only suffering from unemployment, but also from unrequited love, and he felt more bored. So he went to Gu Hongquan's house every day to tease Gu's wife, Gu Wang. The night before last, he saw Liu Wang going to Gu's house again, so he invited a friend to follow her to Gu's house, and teased Liu Wang and Gu Wang, asking to have fun. They were shocked and immediately grabbed Zhu and shouted for help, repeatedly calling for catching robbers. The neighbors gathered when they heard the sound, and Gu Hongquan also returned home from outside. They immediately twisted Zhu Guangxin and sent him to the third sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau. After interrogation, he was sent to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Local Thugs Secretly Investigate Over Two Hundred Pounds of Opium: At about 10:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, a large sand boat passed through the city river of Dayi Bridge Town in the Ninth District of this county. The cabin was empty, but the sand boat was drawing very deep, which was seen by local thugs. Knowing that there was something unusual, they agreed to follow it to a remote place at the end of the market, impersonated policemen, and ordered the ship to stop for inspection. The sand boat crew panicked when they heard the order, but they could not refuse, so they docked the boat. The thugs immediately jumped on the sand boat and found a large amount of opium at the bottom of the cabin. It was said that it weighed more than two hundred pounds. They immediately went ashore, and the sand boat also sailed elsewhere. Yesterday (the 5th), Fang Fengshao, the patrolling officer of the Tenth Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau, got the news and immediately sent police to investigate secretly, but there was no clue. As a result, Officer Fang came to the city and reported to the General Bureau. Currently, detectives have been secretly sent to the countryside to investigate.</p>

<p>Provincial Reorganization Committee Orders the Formation of a Reporters' Association: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee believes that newspaper reporters have been defined by the Central Government as a free profession and can form groups. However, due to the urgency of the time limit, no special law has been promulgated, resulting in nothing to follow. Therefore, it has specially formulated the "Temporary Rules for the Organization of Newspaper Reporters' Associations in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province" and the "Methods for County Party Headquarters to Guide the Organization of Newspaper Reporters' Associations." In addition to reporting to the Central Government, yesterday, it also ordered the various county party headquarters to follow and guide the organization as soon as possible, and limit the complete organization by March 31st.</p>

<p>The Storm of Destroying City God Idols Has Been Resolved: The executive and supervisory committee members of the County Party Headquarters, in order to completely eliminate superstition, destroyed all the idols in the City God Temple, which aroused a backlash from various Taoist nuns. At about 6:00 PM on the 27th, they gathered people to destroy the County Party Headquarters and the residences of Party Committee members Huang Songtao and Huang Renyan. They also marched in the streets for several days, ordering shops to close. It is now heard that County Magistrate Wang has negotiated with the various Taoist nuns, and it has been agreed that the area from the main gate of the temple to the main hall will be converted into a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and the back hall will be the City God Temple.

Fortunately, there was a company of troops from the 94th Brigade of the Liang Ministry on board the ship, so they opened fire with the bandits. As a result, four officers and soldiers were injured, eight bandits were killed, and sixteen were captured alive. They have been sent to the Yangzhou Pacification Supervisory Office for handling according to law.

<p>Director of Education Bureau Maintains Method of Education Expenses: Due to the collection relationship, the education funds in Yangzhong County must feel very embarrassed every spring. Moreover, the county is remote and poor, and there is no money house to borrow from. The new Director of the Education Bureau, Fan Xuezhen, took office and happened to be at this difficult time. Therefore, Fan has formulated several methods: (1) Request the county government to continue to collect the unfinished universal education mu tax for the seventeenth year of the Republic. (2) Draft a temporary method for education fund relief. The general idea is to ask the county government to issue promissory notes worth three thousand yuan during these four months of difficulty, with a face value of one yuan each, allowing them to be used to pay off the busy periods above and below. The Education Bureau will then distribute five percent of the full salary (one thousand four hundred yuan per month) to each school on a monthly basis. The teachers and staff can make credit loans to parents and friends in the school's location to maintain themselves. When the busy periods above and below are collected, they will be repaid in installments over six months, with five hundred yuan being withdrawn each month from June to November. This can not only maintain the difficult situation for the first four months of the year, but also not hinder the various expenses for the second six months. (3) In addition to the promissory notes being issued at five percent, if the county government and the Education Bureau receive a certain amount of cash in the near future, they will distribute it to each school on a pro rata basis. (4) Regarding the school supplies for each school, the Education Bureau will purchase them on credit from bookstores in Zhenjiang and distribute them to each school for use. This will not only prevent the principals from embezzling private funds, but also allow the principals to collect cash from the students' parents to supplement the funds. (5) Actively pursue and collect any outstanding or unpaid rent from the Education Bureau's own property. The above are all methods in the absence of methods for education expenses, so as to avoid the principals' trekking to claim salaries affecting students' studies, and to ensure that schools and administration do not interfere with each other. It is now heard that the issuance of promissory notes has been approved by the county government meeting and is being submitted to the provincial government for review. Once approved, it can be realized.</p>

<p>Bandit Atmosphere Rampant in Eastern Anhui: Jiang Guochang's gang of bandits, entrenched on the border of Anhui and Dingyuan, previously fled into the territory of Liuhe. They were repulsed by the Xu Regiment of the Garrison Brigade and retreated back, entrenched in the Xiaohongshan area of the county. Recently, they have colluded with Mao Liu's and Fan's gangs from Sixian, totaling more than six hundred people, and the remnants of Ma Yuren's troops from Jiangbei, four to five hundred people, totaling more than two thousand people, with complete firearms and a great momentum. From the eastern border of Dingyuan, extending to the old Jiashan, Zhong Jiashan, Xiaohongshan, Zilaiqiao, and surrounding areas of Sanjie, more than a hundred li in circumference, have become areas where bandits gather. Jiang's gang and the remnants of Ma's troops gathered east of the railway, and Mao's and Fan's gangs gathered west of the railway, supporting each other. In recent days, they have captured more than thirty fortresses in Shangzhou, Dayue, and Yinshanji, abducting more than three hundred hostages and killing more than a hundred people. All the self-defense firearms were lost. Today, the bandits have approached the Xiaobian Village and Dagan Village area, only a few li away from Mingguang, and the townspeople are extremely panicked. In addition to the strict defense by the Wang Regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Division stationed there and the Self-Defense Corps, all public groups jointly telegraphed the headquarters and the provincial government, requesting that a large army be sent quickly to encircle and suppress them.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Guaranteeing Independent Funding for Education After the Abolition of Lilkin and Unified Salt Tax <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>▲ Local Customs Authorities to Allocate as Usual</p>
<p>｜Executive Yuan Orders Ministry of Finance to Handle｜</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously drafted measures to continue guaranteeing funding for education after the abolition of Lilkin and unified salt tax, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The cases were approved by the governments of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, and reports were received from the education departments of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Rehe provinces, as well as the education bureau of Beiping municipality. They stated that the central government's order to abolish Lilkin and unify the salt tax would greatly affect educational funding, and requested measures to maintain independence, etc. These were successively submitted to the ministry.</p>
<p>It is noted that our party's internal policy platform includes provisions for determining and guaranteeing the independence of educational funding. Furthermore, the ministry, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, issued a general order to all provinces and municipalities to strictly comply with this, and that the established local educational funding should not be arbitrarily altered. In recent years, various provinces and municipalities, in accordance with the provisions for the independence of educational funding in the political platform, have adopted appropriate measures, such as adding surcharges to salt taxes or allocating a portion of regular taxes as a fixed educational fund. Therefore, educational facilities in various provinces have made progress to varying degrees, except in special circumstances.</p>
<p>Now that the abolition of Lilkin has been implemented and salt tax surcharges are limited to unified collection by the Ministry of Finance from March 1, 1931, the fundamental foundation of the aforementioned educational fund is shaken. Although there is this surcharge, the original dedicated expenditure will be difficult to replenish in a short time. It is also stipulated that a factual report should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and referral to the Ministry of Finance to devise methods for allocating funds to subsidize it. However, there are still no concrete measures determined, and education departments and bureaus in various provinces and municipalities generally believe that the reduction in original educational funding due to the abolition of Lilkin or other factors is difficult to compensate for, and they will be without funds for a while, causing widespread anxiety. Letters and telegrams have been pouring in, and some directors of education have even traveled from afar to Beijing to appeal. Furthermore, educational organizations from various regions have been sending representatives to the ministry to call for action, urgently requesting the clarification of relief measures to prevent the current ongoing educational endeavors from being halted midway.</p>
<p>Previously, the Executive Yuan's Order No. 4252 stated that educational funding is essential for the vitality of schools, and the government should be responsible for planning to ensure that regular expenses are not lacking and that the fund is not shaken, so as not to hinder educational development and independence, etc. Indeed, education is a long-term plan and a fundamental undertaking of construction, which cannot be interrupted for a single day. Educational funding should continue to be guaranteed its independence to comply with the party's political platform. Now, to comply with the party platform, protect the independence of educational funding, and relieve the current educational crisis, the following measures are proposed: (1) Educational special funds allocated from national regular taxes or surtaxes, such as Lilkin and surcharges on salt, tobacco, and alcohol, etc., should be allocated by designated local national tax authorities according to the original approved amount before definite compensatory measures are determined, to avoid educational disruption. (2) Local special taxes that have long been designated for educational special funds, such as those with special characteristics that do not significantly conflict with the newly promulgated tax system, should be allowed to continue to be handled as before. If it is necessary to levy new taxes, the original plan should be consulted, and this tax revenue should still be allocated for educational funding. (3) Designated national tax authorities and other financial authorities should allocate local educational funding on a monthly basis to educational administrative agencies or educational funding management committees to avoid delays, arrears, and misappropriation.</p>
<p>The above measures are of great importance to the education of the entire province. The Ministry of Education has prepared this document and respectfully requests the Executive Yuan to review and instruct compliance. The Executive Yuan Secretariat replied that the Ministry of Education's submission regarding the draft measures to continue guaranteeing the independent funding of education after the abolition of Lilkin and unified salt tax was submitted for review. The case was brought up at the 11th National Affairs Conference of the Executive Yuan and, according to the first measure, the Ministry of Finance was ordered to handle it accordingly, and an order has been issued accordingly. You are hereby informed for your reference.</p>

<p>Chinese Athletes Rise Up, Achieve Merit on the Field</p>
<p>Portuguese Stars Mostly Absent, Strength Reduced</p>
<p>The Chinese team gathered the elite, concentrated the talent, and with its swift horses, the enemy forces collapsed. Amidst the cheers and laughter, they scored three goals in a row, defeating the Portuguese in the International Cup semi-final. From then on, the championship is within sight, and the path is clear. To raise our national emblem above all nations. The magnificent and inspiring atmosphere of last year will not be difficult to see again in this tournament. How will our athletes work hard in the final stage?</p>
<h3 id="e107">Serving the Country, Worthy of Good Men <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Those who were listed in the Chinese team yesterday all attended the stadium in Chinese attire, their military morale was strong, and their morale was high. Everyone served the country and forgot their personal interests, worthy of being good men. In the first half, the forwards did not coordinate well and failed to achieve their full potential. Only our inner two lines, Zhang, showed their might, rejecting people thousands of miles away. Starting in the second half, the five generals cooperated with each other, breaking through the enemy's formation. Chen Zhenhe, Dai Linjing, and Chen Yutian divided the three goals equally, creating a result of 3-0. All eleven soldiers had merits. Zhou Xianyan, the iron gate, and Li on the left and Feng on the right, were two major barriers, which the enemy regarded as a daunting task. Zhou only swayed his arms, looked up at the sky, and waited for the opportunity. Occasionally, when the enemy knocked on the door, Zhou calmly and unhurriedly dealt with it as if nothing had happened. The inner guards Li and Feng were outstanding talents with exceptional skills, truly impeccable. Zhuang Shihong, the center back, strictly guarded the famous general Colasa, never leaving him, which made Colasa pale in comparison. It was truly commendable. The old general Chen Pu was well-deserved. Although he was weak after his illness, he was still able to retreat the enemy. Chen Jiaqiu's ball skills improved rapidly, and he was able to attack and defend equally well, and his passing and sending were extremely varied. The five forwards all performed their duties to the fullest. The right side was particularly active. In the second half, the substitution of Chen Zhenhe and Luo Haiguang revitalized the left side. The entire army used its full strength to achieve great success.</p>

<p>The Portuguese have four heroes who are famous in Shanghai: inner guard Marcel, center back Gois Tai, center forward Colasa, and winger Foqiao. Now that three of the four are gone, only Colasa is supporting the building. The hope of victory is greatly diminished. Fortunately, the Portuguese have a strong sense of patriotism and continue to fight. The forwards emerge and disappear, unparalleled in their精銳, and the inner guards are also able to barely satisfy the requirements. However, the goalkeeper's skills are disappointing. Two of the three goals lost were their own fault. As a result, their morale was diminished and their military heart was disturbed.</p>

<p>On that day, the Yiyuan was full of distinguished guests, a grand occasion. Whenever China made progress, they shouted loudly to help the army's feelings. If there were any setbacks, their faces would show worry. After the good news spread frequently, they raised their eyebrows and exhaled, danced with their hands and feet, and the spring breeze filled the garden. There is no greater joy in life than this.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Clouds of War are Full, China and Portugal Work Hard Together <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After the bell rang three times, the referee Li Te announced the battle order, and the Chinese and Portuguese armies began to attack. The Portuguese attacked with the wind, showing great momentum. Feng was effective, and the ball situation turned. Chen Zhenhe挑中, Luo Haiguang扑门, the goalkeeper caught it and threw it out, Chen Yutian 洪寳又先后窥门, but were unsuccessful. Dai Lin Jing fired several shots, but did not hit the target. The Portuguese suddenly invaded, Chen Jiaqiu回马救驾解围而出. Chen Yutian passed the ball to the center, the goalkeeper came out far, the gate opened wide, Chen Yutian attacked directly at the door, but was a little short. Finally, the Portuguese kicked a free kick outside the penalty area in the Chinese zone, and it went diagonally outside the door. Neither side gained anything in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e111">▲ Goalkeeping Not Good, Chen Zhenhe Achieves Merit <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Starting in the second half, the left winger Chen Zhenhe and the left inner forward Luo Haiguang exchanged positions. From then on, the entire forward line became more active, sometimes left, sometimes right, sometimes forward, sometimes back. The enemy's formation shook and gradually became unsustainable. Chen Zhenhe挑中 from the left side of the baseline. The goalkeeper was not good, he got it and lost it again, and touched the net. There was a great shout of荷荷. This goal was only four minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="e112">▲ Important Passages Fall, Dai Linjing Breaks Through <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After China got a goal, its momentum doubled. Before long, the five generals showed their power again,守出中伏, the inner guard quickly returned to avoid disaster. The Portuguese developed once, and after turning and entering deeply, the right inner foot shot at the goal, the ball went towards the corner of the door, Zhou Xianyan jumped up and caught it,化险为夷. The three generals in the middle of China 連破關隘, Dai Linjing神脚起处,打人门中, and scored the second goal.</p>
<h3 id="e113">▲ Those in the Game are Confused, Chen Yutian Gets Lucky <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Afterwards, there was no peaceful territory in the Portuguese zone, and the Chinese forwards were active everywhere. Occasionally, the Portuguese led their troops to counterattack, but were either blocked by the middle line or strangled by the inner guards, or they could not pass the hands of the iron gate. After several ineffectiveness, the home camp suddenly gave an alarm, under pressure, the situation was flat, so Anmen was panicked and confused,踢与陈虞添.洪运高照, Chen Yutian got the third goal without effort.</p>
<h3 id="e114">▲ The Mountains are Exhausted and the Water is Gone, the Portuguese Struggle <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Portuguese have lost three goals in a row, and have reached the point where the mountains are exhausted and the water is gone. They made a final struggle to avoid total annihilation. Colasa took the lead and passed the ball to the right, taking the opportunity to enter directly. Zhou Xianyan撲地擒住,随手抛出, Chen Pu帶出重围, Colashi once again made a visit,发腿射门, the lone pillar弹地, Chen Jiaqiu救驾有功, and the龙门全保. As a result, China净胜 three goals.</p>

<p>Defeated Mailing in a battle at 2:00 PM yesterday</p>
<p>Won the West Youth Association Championship for Three Consecutive Years</p>
<p>The West Youth Association's basketball games for men and women have all ended successively. The results are not bad, and the spirit is still good. Yesterday, the volleyball competition also ended. The China Youth team defeated Mailing by two to one in a dangerous state, winning the championship. It is not easy to win for three consecutive years. Prizes were awarded at 5:00 PM and then everyone left.</p>
<h3 id="e116">▲ Two Heroes Meet <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>This year's Mailing team惊人胜利之神,追随左右, has never been defeated. It is side by side with the China Youth team,相互嫓美. Yesterday was the last week of the competition, and the two heroes met. It is inevitable that one will try to put the other to sleep,实为势所必争. The Chinese people's interest in volleyball is not very strong. Among the 400 spectators, Westerners account for the majority.</p>
<h3 id="e117">▲ Victory or Defeat <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>In terms of the skills of both sides,实相伯仲,无甚轩轾. China Youth wants to穷千里目,更上一层楼, and Mailing wants to为山九仞,功亏一篑. Some viewers said that yesterday's battle was not a disparity in strength, but was actually a matter of whether the ball was运之亨通. Is that really the case? This reporter doesn't dare to断焉, but to congratulate China Youth and pity Mailing. The team rosters for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ China Youth Team: Li Feiyun (Captain), Chen Baoqiu, Li Shunliang, Li Rongfang, Cai Tiange, Guo Diaoping, Tan Tianpei, Cheng Guoxiang, Wei Youhan, Chen Yuehe, Chen Fuzhang (Executive).</p>
<p>▲ Mailing Team: Pei Demao (Captain), Ge Laihan, Qiangsheng, Bie Xiepu, Huogen, Wu Kede, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Favoritism <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Before the game, Mr. Bai Lande took the matter seriously, measuring the height of the net and整理其他设备. If this action is taken, this reporter has never seen it in the dozens of competitions this year. Is it because this battle is related to the championship that it is extra particular? It is inevitable to favor one over the other. The referee was Lai Heer, and the inspector was Bai Lande.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Late Comer <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the first game, the压杀 of Chen Baoqiu of China Youth and Pei Demao of Mailing were both very magical. However, both sides were slow to score. After the start, China Youth疏于检点, and repeatedly committed触网过线,忍气吞声 with a score of 2-5. Then, they got the right to发球, and they were able to handle it with ease, and they were able to catch up later, from 9-5 to 13-5, and finally won the first game with 15-8, and they had喜色 on their faces.</p>
<p>▲ Ominous Sign</p>
<p>In the second game, when Fang Mailing飞扬跋扈 and scored 4-0, the photographer did not notify in advance, and suddenly拦拍楼头电光照.With a shout, the red light万道, not only the soldiers were startled, but the audience was also caught off guard. This gentleman is truly a prankster. The referee didn't know what to do in the hazy smoke. At this time, Mailing was still盛气相浚. When seven points were reached, China Youth was still in a乌有之乡. Later, Chen Baoqiu and Li Feiyun and others made contributions one after another,追得 six points. But the opponent soon复以 12-6,遥遥居前. China Youth再接再厉 and the scores became 13 points each. 13 points is an ominous sign. Mailing was the first to score 15 points, and China Youth was two points behind. So each won a game, and the kill became more and more difficult to solve.</p>
<h3 id="e120">▲ From Bad to Good <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>In the third game, in this 危急存亡之秋, each side used their best efforts to fight each other. 瞬息千变, and it was impossible to捉摸. China Youth捲土重来 and won five points in a row, 气吞长虹. But Mailing 不折不挠, and in the midst of困苦,竟反杀将来, with China Youth falling behind by 1 point with a score of 5-6. The front line was chaotic, and there was self-collision跌扑. However, from bad to good, after a few minutes, they finally won this game with 15-10 and won the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e125">New Chang Steamer of the China Merchants Bureau Runs Aground <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲ Near Saddle Island</p>
<p>▲ Due to Heavy Sea Fog</p>
<p>▲ Passengers Safe and Sound</p>
<p>The New Chang steamer of the China Merchants Bureau, en route from Dalian to Shantou, ran aground on the night of the 6th. While sailing near Saddle Island outside of Wusong, it suddenly encountered dense fog and heavy winds. The ship became stuck on the reef, with its hull wedged into the rocks. One of the cargo holds has already cracked. Upon receiving the news, the Shanghai office immediately began rescue efforts. The details of the accident, including the circumstances from beginning to end, are urgently investigated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Accident: The New Chang steamer, loaded with 30,000 dan of soybeans and soybean cakes in Dalian, set sail from Dalian Bay on the 3rd of this month, heading directly for Shantou to unload. The journey was relatively calm until 7:30 PM on the 6th, when it reached a point 67 nautical miles from Wusong and 12 nautical miles east of Daji Mountain, near a place called Elliot Islands (Furu Mountain). The sea was foggy, and the wind and waves were extremely strong, with waves rising to a height of ten to fifteen feet. The ship was tossed about by the huge waves and became impossible to steer. Outside the Furu Mountain reefs, the water was swirling with immense suction. The New Chang steamer, with First Mate Zhao Shimei on duty, was hit by the violent wind and waves with a loud crash and ran aground on the Furu Mountain reefs. The bottom of the ship became wedged in the submerged reefs, rendering it unable to move.</p>
<p>▲ Circumstances of Running Aground: The New Chang ran aground at 7:15 PM on the 6th. At that time, the ship was being pulled by the swirling water, making it impossible to move. When it hit the submerged reefs, the area that became wedged was near the engine room. Seawater immediately began to enter, but fortunately, the bottoms of the cargo holds had not been breached.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no seawater in the cargo holds, but because the reef is stuck in the ship, the vessel cannot be moved, for fear that the bottom of the hold will be torn open by the rocks.</p>
<p>▲ Ship's Owner Asks for Help: The ship's owner, Soden, urgently sent an SOS wireless telegraph signal after the accident. The first to receive the message was the Italian mail steamer Ganji and the Lijin patrol ship of the Jianghai Customs. In accordance with the obligation to provide assistance in maritime disasters, the Italian mail steamer dispatched three motorboats to Furu Mountain Reef to rescue the crew of the New Chang. However, the wind and waves were too strong, and the three motorboats were unable to proceed. The Lijin patrol ship then dispatched a lifeboat to assist in the rescue. They first rescued 25 members of the ship's cargo handling staff, including Tang Rihua, and transferred them to the Yih Ho Yang Hang's Kuang Sheng steamer to be taken back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Office Rescue Efforts: The Shanghai China Merchants Bureau received an urgent telegram from the New Chang steamer reporting the accident on the night of the 6th. Upon receiving the report, General Manager Li immediately ordered the shipping department to rush to handle the rescue work. He immediately ordered the Xinfeng and Kuangli steamers in Shanghai to fire up their engines and stand by for departure. However, after consideration, he decided that due to the strong wind and waves and the swift currents, it would not be appropriate to send large ships, as it could be dangerous. Therefore, he hired the Huidefeng large tugboat Xuepuxun, carrying machinery and food, to rush to the site of the accident to provide assistance. At the same time, he ordered the chief captain McKenna, first mate Gu Jiuquan, chief engineer Ying Xiaorong, engineer Zhang Yao, and helmsmen to board the tugboat and sail to the accident site to assess the situation and direct the rescue efforts.</p>
<p>Hai Yan Sets Sail: General Manager Li, considering that there were 112 crew members, sailors, and cargo escorts on board the New Chang steamer, telegraphed the Hai Yan steamer (returning to Shanghai from Wenzhou) and the Kuangda steamer (sailing from Shanghai to Shantou and Guangdong), which were traveling and closer to Saddle Island, to quickly change course to the site and join the rescue efforts, for the sake of the safety of the crew and passengers. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai office received a telegram stating that the Hai Yan steamer had arrived at the Saddle Island waters at 6 PM and was carrying out rescue work. The Jianghai Customs' Lijin ship had also arrived near Furu Mountain to assist in rescuing the crew.</p>
<p>▲ Crew Safety: The ship was sailing from Dalian this time and did not carry passengers, only five cargo escorts. All the crew members and sailors, except for the 25 members of the cargo handling department, including Lu Ji, Liang Ding, Mai Libao, Cao En, and Yu Gao, who were rescued by the Kuang Sheng steamer and arrived in Shanghai at 11 AM yesterday, reported the accident to the office. The office immediately arranged accommodation for these individuals. After the New Chang accident, more than 40 crew members temporarily sought refuge on Furu Mountain. Yesterday, the office received another telegram from the New Chang stating that all the crew members were safe and had been rescued onto the Lijin, Hai Yan, and Xuepuxun ships. They may all be transported back to Shanghai last night or today.</p>
<p>▲ Question of Responsibility: The accident was entirely due to fog and heavy wind and waves. The ship's owner, Soden, is British and has a wealth of experience and is known to be careful in the maritime industry. He has been working for the New Chang for more than a decade. He is familiar with the navigation routes in the North and South Seas and has never made a mistake. The first and second mates, Zhao Shimei and Sun Zhuoren, are also highly experienced. The grounding this time was truly an unpredictable natural disaster and an irresistible maritime accident. According to the Italian mail steamer owner, the New Chang accident was indeed impossible to prevent. He also said that the seawater in that area is swirling and the wind and waves are huge, and even large ships can hardly avoid such unexpected maritime accidents.</p>
<p>▲ Ship's Overview: The New Chang has a deadweight of 2,000 tons and was built in 1905. Its speed is 11 nautical miles per hour. The cabins are excellent, and the hull is very strong. It is the only excellent ship of the Bureau capable of sailing to Hong Kong. The ship is currently valued at 800,000 taels. This time, the submerged reef became wedged in the engine room. If seawater does not enter the cargo holds within 48 hours, it may still be possible to rescue it. However, it is said that some of the beans in one of the cargo holds have been soaked in water and have swelled, causing the hull to crack. Yesterday, the Bureau also telegraphed the Ministry of the Navy to send warships to protect the rescue ships and prevent pirates from looting. Currently, the New Chang is stranded on the reefs and has not shown any signs of sinking.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the National Government: To Chairman Chiang of the National Government in Nanjing: Late this evening, we received an urgent telegram from the New Chang steamer stating that it had run aground due to fog near Saddle Island outside of Wusong and requesting rescue. We immediately telegraphed the ships along the coast to rush to the rescue and urgently dispatched the Kuangda and Hai Yan steamers, which were the closest in terms of navigation, to return and assist in the rescue. At the same time, we hired additional tugboats and ordered the chief captain and engineers to lead the staff and workers, carrying food and clothing, to rush to meet them. The responsible officers worked through the night. We have now received confirmed reports from all parties stating that all the personnel on board have been safely evacuated and that 25 people have been transported back to the Bureau by the Yih Ho Kuang Sheng steamer. The rest will arrive later tonight. However, we have heard that the hull has cracked due to the beans and soybean cakes swelling upon contact with water. The New Chang was heading to Dalian to load goods and sailing directly to Shantou, which was very profitable in terms of business. The captain, an Englishman named Soden, and the first mate, Zhao Shimei, have both been serving on the ship for many years, are highly qualified, and have a wealth of experience. They were on duty together at the time of the accident. The reason for the accident will only be known in detail after the captain returns to the Bureau. I am writing to report this matter first, and further reports will follow. Your subordinate, Li Zhonggong, humbly reports.</p>

A copy of the credentials is expected to be sent to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the next few days and then forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing. The new minister could have arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, but the Ganges encountered fog outside of Wusong, which delayed its arrival until the afternoon. Those who went to the Gonghexiang Wharf to welcome him yesterday included Liu Yunfang, representative of Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, and Czech Consul General Lai Faer. The new Czech Minister once served as the Consul General in Constantinople and is quite familiar with the situation in the Near and Far East.</p>
<h3 id="e127">International Women's Day Today <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>▲ Commemorative Meeting by the Municipal Women's Association</p>
<p>▲ Declaration of a Letter to Women</p>
<p>Today (8th) is the day when women in countries around the world seek equal liberation. The 8th of March, International Women's Day, is the most glorious and splendid page in the history of the women's movement. The Shanghai Women's Association has specially designated this morning at 9 AM to hold a commemorative meeting in the Association's auditorium. It is reported that in addition to posting slogans on trams, cars, and other vehicles, propaganda teams will be organized to give speeches along the way and to publish a letter to women on International Women's Day, the original text of which is copied below:</p>
<p>Dear sisters, on March 8, 1909, American women who were aware of the situation, because they were unwilling to accept social discrimination and unequal treatment, rose up to hold a great demonstration movement, in order to awaken women's self-liberation. Then, in 1910, when the International Women's Socialists met in the capital of Denmark, it was decided that March 8 would be International Women's Day. The following year, the women of Germany and the United States took the lead in commemorating it, holding large-scale mass demonstrations on "March 8." At the same time, in Vienna, Austria, more than 80,000 female workers participated. Their general demands were "Women's Suffrage" and "Protection of Female Workers," striving for absolute equality between men and women in politics, economics, and society. Later, the women of Britain and the Netherlands also held similar demonstrations. Thus, March 8 has been recognized by countries around the world as a day for international women's propaganda and unity, in order to seek equal liberation. During the World War, women in Western Europe rose up to organize demonstrations against the war, putting forward the slogans of "Bread" and "Peace" to fight for women's economic rights. Therefore, the words "March 8" awakened the obsessed women of East Asian countries and gave Asian women a lot of awareness and stimulation, especially in China. Therefore, "March 8" International Women's Day is really the most glorious and splendid page in the history of the women's liberation movement. Chinese women are subjected to the invasion of international imperialism and the oppression of feudal patriarchal forces, and their suffering is deeper and greater than that of women in Europe and the United States. Naturally, our desire for liberation is more urgent than that of women in Europe and the United States. Since the climax of the "March 8" commemoration was transmitted to China, Chinese women have automatically commemorated it in the same way as women around the world. This not only shows the awareness of Chinese women of their own suffering, but also deeply reflects the recognition and courage of women regarding the need for revolution. Furthermore, the Chinese women's liberation movement has its own special significance, that is, the Chinese women's liberation movement is related to the national revolution movement of the Chinese national liberation movement. The success of the Chinese National Revolution is the liberation of Chinese women, so Chinese women must work together with all the people for the National Revolution. Looking around at the current situation, the evil forces that shackle all women and bind all the people, namely the imperialists abroad and the feudal forces at home, are the targets of the National Revolution. Although they are gradually being eradicated, and at this time when the dawn of a new era is in sight, we feel that we should make further efforts to complete the unfinished success. Oppressed women, rise up! On this day of commemorating "March 8," prepare to rise up! We believe that if we rise up ourselves, we will have great power. We believe even more that only by rising up ourselves can we achieve true liberation. Our slogans are: (1) Commemorate the glorious and great "March 8," (2) Women unite under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, (3) Eradicate feudal patriarchal forces, and (4) Down with imperialism.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Orders the Prohibition of the Housheng Cotton Mill's Sale <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲ And Submits a Request to the Ministry of Industry for Instructions on How to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>Regarding the sale of the Housheng Cotton Mill to the Japanese-owned Gonda Cotton Mill, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has sent Tian Heqing, a staff member of the Second Section, to investigate. As the matter is indeed true, yesterday, the Bureau issued an order to the Housheng Mill, prohibiting the sale to the Japanese company, and submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry requesting instructions on how to handle the matter. The orders and reports are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Order to the Housheng Mill: For the purpose of complying with the order, the case of the mill's impending transfer to a Japanese company, as reported in the Textile Times, was previously ordered by this Bureau to refrain from signing contracts without the approval of this Bureau. Subsequently, the mill responded, stating that there was no sale to a Japanese company. However, on the 3rd of this month, various local newspapers reported that the mill had indeed been sold to the Gonda Cotton Mill. This Bureau sent staff to investigate in detail and inquired with the Gonda Cotton Mill, which admitted to the sale. It was also stated that on the 28th of last month and the 1st of this month, Xue Gansheng, a shareholder of the mill, accompanied Kurachi Shiro, the manager of the Gonda Cotton Mill, and more than ten staff members to the mill to inspect the machinery and measure the factory grounds. There was clear preparation for sale. It is noted that Japanese companies are seeking to establish factories in our country to monopolize the cotton yarn market due to the increase in import tariffs. All of our colleagues in the industry should strive to prevent this in order to save the situation. Even if the mill is unable to maintain itself, it should be transferred to Chinese individuals. However, the mill is not considering this and is acting willfully, selling our dying textile industry to a Japanese company and becoming a laughingstock in the industry, which is regrettable for the mill. Therefore, it is again ordered that the mill comply and immediately cancel any agreements or draft contracts agreed upon with the Gonda Cotton Mill within three days of receiving this order. If you dare to violate this order, you will be severely punished. This order is imperative.</p>
<p>▲ Report to the Ministry of Industry: For the purpose of reporting a matter, the Hua Shang Cotton Mill Federation issued the 768th issue of the Textile Times, stating that since the Housheng Cotton Mill ceased operations, there have been repeated rumors of a sale. It is said that Japanese companies such as Daikang Mill and Shanghai Mill have sent people to inspect and assess the value. Once an agreement is reached, it can be finalized. After this Bureau ordered the mill not to enter into any contracts without the approval of this Bureau, the mill responded, absolutely denying any sale to a Japanese company. However, recent rumors have spread that the mill has been sold to the Gonda Mill. Staff were sent to investigate the matter in detail. According to the report, the Housheng Cotton Mill suffered a loss of more than one million yuan last year due to the impact of soaring gold prices and poor internal management. Therefore, the mill did not intend to continue operating and repeatedly contacted Daikang Cotton Mill, Shanghai Cotton Mill, and Gonda Cotton Mill, Japanese companies, regarding a sale. On the 28th of last month and the 1st of this month, Xue Gansheng, a shareholder of the mill, led Kurachi Shiro, the manager of the Gonda Cotton Mill, and more than ten staff members to the Housheng Cotton Mill to inspect various parts of the machinery and measure the entire factory site. The Japanese companies did indeed have the intention to purchase. When inquiring with the Gonda Cotton Mill, Kawamura, the chief of the general affairs section of the mill, stated that the factory had indeed sent people to the Housheng Cotton Mill twice to inspect it, seemingly intending to buy it. However, a thorough investigation is still needed before reporting to the Japanese Gonda head office. Whether or not the transaction will take place depends on the decision of the head office and is unlikely to happen in the short term. Based on this, it is noted that the Housheng Mill is one of our Chinese-owned cotton mills. The mill has 70,000 yarn spindles and 1,400 weaving machines, with a total of 4,500 male and female workers. If it is sold to a Japanese company, not only will many workers lose their jobs, but the future of the spinning industry will also be affected. It is also noted that Japanese companies are seeking to expand their cotton yarn business in China due to the increase in import taxes. Our cotton textile industry should strive to prevent this. However, the Housheng Cotton Mill is selling its established business to a Japanese company, which is like inviting a wolf into the house and will cause endless harm. Furthermore, the shareholders of the mill, Xue Gansheng (son of Xue Baorun), Bei Runsheng, and Xi Hexian, all have huge personal assets, which should be more than enough to maintain the operation of the mill. Even if a transfer is absolutely necessary, it should be transferred to Chinese individuals first. Alternatively, the cotton mill industry could work together to maintain it, or the government could raise funds to buy it and convert it into a state-owned enterprise. All of these are possible. This matter concerns national welfare and the people's livelihood. In addition to this Bureau directly ordering the mill to comply with the previous order, the Bureau requests instructions from your honorable superiors on how to handle this matter. The circumstances are truthfully reported and respectfully submitted to your honorable superiors for review and guidance. This is a public matter. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Japanese Fishing Boats Falsely Use Registration Numbers <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲ Discovered by the Customs Yellow Boat</p>
<p>▲ Four Vessels Confiscated</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Commissioner ordered the Jiang Patrol Officers (commonly known as "Yellow Boats") stationed at the Wusong Paotai Bay to require Japanese fishing boats to report to the Yellow Boat officers for inspection before entering Shanghai. Since the inspection began, the officers have discovered that only about 20 Japanese fishing boats have been registered with the customs, while the total number of Japanese fishing boats is about 100. When traveling in and out of port, they specifically use fake numbers to deceive the authorities. The officers have paid close attention to this during inspections. On the 26th of last month, the Daicheng Maru No. 12 and Daicheng Maru No. 13 fishing boats were found to be using fake numbers. The two vessels were detained and reported to the Customs Commissioner, who ordered the two vessels to be confiscated. Just as they were about to be auctioned, the Ryobo Maru and the Daiwa Maru, two Japanese fishing boats, suddenly came to communicate on the 5th of this month, conspiring to help the two Daicheng Maru escape. Fortunately, the Yellow Boat officers and crew discovered this and detained all four Japanese vessels for inspection. The Ryobo Maru and the Daiwa Maru also had informal numbers. This has been reported to the Customs Commissioner, who ordered that the four vessels be confiscated. It is also heard that Japanese fishing boats not only fish illegally in the waters of Zhejiang Province, but also have a habit of stealing silk cocoons, causing great harm to fishing boats and making it impossible for them to make a living. Because Japanese fishing boats are equipped with diesel engines, after the fishing boats cast their nets and the fish are full, the fishing boats only need to pass by the boat, and the fish and nets are swept away by the propellers. As a result, the boatmen suffer significant losses. They have submitted a petition to the relevant authorities in Zhejiang Province, requesting that they make serious representations to the Japanese side.</p>

<p>▲ Office Open as Usual Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Election Office for National Assembly Representatives issued a notice on the 6th, informing all groups to collect registration forms for the election register, with a deadline of today. Yesterday, those who went to the office to collect them were very enthusiastic. Several dozens of groups, including Fudan University, Datong University, Tongji University, three universities, and the National Medical Association, were among them. However, some trade associations who went to the office to collect the registration forms were not allowed to do so because the office considered trade associations to be included within the Chamber of Commerce. In addition, the Wushi Association, a free professional group, and the preparatory committee for the carpentry workers' union, which has not yet been formally established, were not allowed to collect the registration forms. The office will continue to be open as usual today.</p>

<p>▲ Adopting Zhang Jiaao's Proposal</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, when the International Chamber of Commerce held an executive committee meeting in Paris a few days ago, Zhang Jiaao, the general manager of the Bank of China, sent a telegram to the meeting, proposing to convene an international silver price conference to discuss the issue of silver prices. Later, a few days ago, Mr. Zhang received a reply from Mr. Tolins, the general secretary of the meeting, stating that he was urging the national branches of the meeting to request their respective governments to immediately contact each other to convene an international conference. Private sources also indicated that Mr. Tolins's letter to the national branches was quite effective. It is expected that the diplomatic circles of various countries will soon exchange views. Yesterday, this port also received a private telegram from Geneva, stating that after receiving Mr. Zhang's telegram, the meeting immediately exchanged views with the League of Nations. It is now heard that the League of Nations is planning to adopt this suggestion. However, according to a certain important figure in this port, if such an international conference can be realized, at least one month of preparation is required before convening it. It is expected that Mr. Tolins's notification letter will be delivered to the Chinese branch in this port within the next week.</p>

<p>▲Two Replies from the Consolidated Tax Bureau</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Bureau yesterday replied to the letter from the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, stating: "To the esteemed Association, your letter along with Mr. Zhou Xinbo's opinion paper has been received and carefully reviewed. The points you raised are not without merit. However, at the initial stage of implementing the consolidated tax, this Bureau had to strive for meticulousness in the tax collection procedures to ensure smooth execution. If businesses find it burdensome, any requests for changes will be carefully considered and improved to ensure both the tax policy and business interests are well-served. Regarding the Customs' continued collection of tariffs on goods that have already paid the consolidated tax, this Bureau received a letter from the Customs Administration yesterday, stating that the Inspector General of Customs has telegraphed instructions to all Customs offices to cease the collection and has stipulated that any cotton yarn tariffs collected after February 1st should be refunded upon presentation of the consolidated tax receipt. This Bureau has already copied the letter and notified your Association to inform relevant parties. It is expected that such issues will not arise again in the future. We hereby reply for your information and request that you forward this to Mr. Zhou of Zhentai Cotton Mill for his reference."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Bureau replied to the Cotton Cloth Industry Association: "To the esteemed Association, your letter has been received. Regarding the collection of export tariffs by various Customs offices on cotton yarn and cloth that have already paid the consolidated tax, this Bureau received a reply from the Customs Administration yesterday, stating that the Inspector General of Customs had telegraphed that the procedures for collecting the consolidated tax were finalized on the 20th of this month after thorough study and have been communicated to all Customs offices for compliance. The notification also stipulates that any cotton yarn tariffs collected after February 1st should be refunded upon presentation of the consolidated tax receipt. This has been communicated to the Bureau and forwarded to the Chinese Cotton Mill Association for notification on March 2nd. It is expected that there will be no further instances of repeated taxation or hindering transportation. We hereby reply for your information and request that you inform all businesses accordingly."</p>

<h3 id="e136">Various Industries Request Reduction in Business Tax <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲Restaurant Industry</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Kefan, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association, sent a letter to the Tax Rules Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "To the esteemed Committee, we have reviewed the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations Draft and found that the business tax of 20 per mille (2%) for the restaurant industry, as specified in Article 4 and the tax rate table, exceeds the Ministry's established guideline by ten times, which is truly unbearable. The raw materials purchased by the restaurant industry daily, including dried goods, seafood, rice, flour, fish, meat, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, chicken, duck, and various other ingredients, are all subject to tax. After being cooked and subjected to the business tax, we request a reduction in taxation [point one]. The government's decision to abolish likin and implement tax reform is admired by businesses and citizens. Business tax collection is a duty of citizens to supplement local finances. We earnestly request that the Jiangsu Province's proposed business tax standard, based on the Ministry's guideline of 1 to 2 per mille (0.1% to 0.2%), be applied to the restaurant industry, as the current 20 per mille (2%) is extremely difficult to bear. Our businesses cater specifically to the essential dining needs of merchants and customers, and a reduced tax rate of 1 per mille (0.1%) is particularly warranted [point two]. The circumstances within our area are unique, with separate Chinese and foreign concessions. The business tax must be implemented simultaneously in both concessions to avoid disputes among businesses. Most large restaurants are located in the concessions, and simultaneous implementation is necessary [point three]. In summary, we request that your Committee review and forward our concerns to the authorities, requesting a reduction in the business tax to 1 per mille (0.1%) and a revision of the taxable standards and tax rate table to adopt the principle of 'one item, one tax' to benefit the people's livelihood and alleviate the difficulties of businesses. We earnestly request that your Committee adopt our humble suggestions and conduct a study. We respectfully submit this letter with the hope that you will consider it. We are deeply grateful.

<p>▲Woolen Fabric Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Woolen Fabric Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "To the esteemed Committee, we are dismayed by the 15 and 20 per mille (1.5% and 2%) tax rates on woolen fabrics in the draft business tax regulations issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Our industry's woolen fabrics include all kinds of cotton and wool raw materials. In addition to Chinese and foreign woolen fabrics, we also deal in piece goods, hence the name 'woolen fabrics,' but it is not limited to wool and woolens alone. For example, the silk and satin industry primarily refers to silk and satin, but it also deals in woolen fabrics and foreign goods. Similarly, the foreign cloth industry mainly refers to cloth, but it also deals in woolen fabrics. In terms of industry nomenclature, there are names like silk and satin, foreign cloth, and woolen fabrics, but in actual business, the woolen fabric industry also deals in cloth, and the silk and satin and foreign cloth industries almost always deal in woolen fabrics. It is a mixed rather than a pure industry, and in the current business practice, it is impossible to separate them. Therefore, an equal tax rate should be applied to silk and satin, foreign cloth, and woolen fabrics [point one]. Regarding woolen fabrics themselves, with the increasing invention and sale of domestic products, they cannot all be considered expensive imports requiring regulation. Moreover, woolen fabrics are durable. In terms of value, many are equivalent to ordinary cotton cloth, and silk-like cotton cloth is one to two times more expensive than woolen fabrics. They are plain and unadorned, suitable for daily wear, and have become a common type of clothing that cannot be equated with luxury goods. When making clothes for ordinary people, not only is the price low, but the durability is also important, making woolen fabrics the first choice. Woolen fabrics are indeed necessities of life. Therefore, a light tax should be applied to woolen fabrics [point two]. However, the draft business tax regulations of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments impose tax rates of 15 and 20 per mille (1.5% and 2%) on woolen fabrics, which are necessities of life. This not only contradicts the general guidelines but also fails to understand social conditions and the needs of the people. Therefore, the public is confused and there is a strong backlash. As this city is in the initial stage of drafting business tax regulations, we should consider both tax policies, business difficulties, social conditions, and people's livelihood. Therefore, we submit this letter detailing the situation of our industry. We earnestly request that your Committee forward it to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Finance for detailed review, ensuring that the tax rate does not exceed 2 per mille (0.2%). If the tax rates set by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments are adopted, it will not only deprive businesses of their livelihood but also endanger the capital of stores, leaving businesses and citizens without means of survival. In addition to sending representatives to submit our concerns in person, we are sending this letter in advance, hoping for your consideration."</p>
<p>▲Department Store Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Department Store Industry Association stated that the 10 per mille (1%) business tax set by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Governments exceeds the maximum rate of the general guidelines by more than five times, making it unbearable. The tax rates are inconsistent and based on individual items. The industry sells nearly a thousand items, and future disturbances are inevitable. Therefore, Zheng Hairuo, Zhang Wei, Cheng Guichu, Zheng Chengqing, Chen Xiangqing, and other representatives were sent to Beijing the day before yesterday to petition. They arrived in Beijing yesterday morning and are staying at the Central Hotel. In the afternoon, they petitioned the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry.</p>

<p>▲Wang Shoutin and Others Accompanied Him</p>
<p>The Ministry of Navy plans to establish a naval academy in Xiangshan and assign the training ship Tongji to be stationed there permanently. The details are being planned. After Rear Admiral Chen Shaokuan, Vice Minister of the Navy and Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he had to go to Xiangshan to inspect the design and construction of the naval academy. Therefore, he temporarily telegraphed the Yongjian warship, which was about to leave the Wusong port, to postpone its departure for Beijing. Chen, accompanied by Wang Shoutin, captain of the Hai Rong warship, and two Westerners, boarded a naval launch from Gaochang Temple and crossed the Wusong port to board the Yongjian warship. The ship set sail for Ningbo that night and is expected to return in about two days.</p>

<p>▲Held Once Every Five Years</p>
<p>According to diplomatic sources, the International Women's Association, since its inception in 1888, has stipulated that a conference be held once every five years, hence the name "Five-Year Conference." The Eighth Conference was held in Vienna, Austria, from May 29 to June 5, 1920, lasting eight days. Representatives from more than 40 countries attended, with over 600 members. The Chinese representative was Ms. Tang Baozhu, minister to Sweden and Norway. Although the conference lasted only eight days, more than 70 resolutions were passed, covering revisions to the association's constitution, as well as discussions on issues such as peace, education, law, health, women's occupation, and economy.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Close Qibao Branch Office <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued an instruction to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "For compliance, we have received Municipal Government Instruction No. 7389, which states: 'Approved Jiangsu Provincial Government Consultation No. 319 regarding this matter. According to a report from the Department of Construction, the Magistrate of Songjiang County, Jin Qingzhang, reported that the Chairman of the Xinzhuang Town Chamber of Commerce, Wang Zhaoyun, reported that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce had established a branch office in Qibao Town, which is beyond its jurisdiction. Despite repeated negotiations by the local chamber of commerce, no resolution has been reached. The circumstances of the negotiation are submitted for your review. We request that the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau argue the case and forward it to the Provincial Department for instruction to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to close the branch office in order to uphold regional integrity and comply with the law.' Eight accompanying documents are attached. Accordingly, after investigation, Qibao Town has long been under the jurisdiction of the Xinzhuang Town Chamber of Commerce in Songjiang County. The scope of business branch offices should naturally be based on the original chamber of commerce boundaries, as clarified by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Commercial Instruction No. 11256. Given the aforementioned circumstances, in addition to instructing and informing the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau to petition the Provincial Department for approval, we have copied the original attachments and submitted a special report for your review and guidance. According to Article 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, the area of a chamber of commerce shall be the administrative area of the city or county. Since the area of Qibao Town is provisionally excluded from the city's jurisdiction, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce should not establish a branch office there prematurely, as it will cause disputes. The aforementioned circumstances concern a matter of provincial and municipal administrative areas. In addition to instructing, we are reporting and requesting your review and instruction to order the closure of the branch office to avoid disputes and to receive your response.' Approved. Since Qibao Town is provisionally excluded from the city's jurisdiction, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce should not establish a branch office there prematurely, as it will cause disputes. Therefore, we request an investigation and instruction to close the branch office to prevent disputes and receive your response." It is reported that after receiving the order, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has forwarded it to Yang Xueqiao, director of the Qibao branch office, to comply with the order and close the office.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Proposal to Increase Tobacco Tax for Disaster Relief to be Postponed <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The proposal to increase the cigarette tax to issue public bonds for disaster relief, after being submitted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Executive Yuan and referred to the Ministry of Finance for review, has now been postponed by the Executive Yuan based on a petition from Bian Qihuan, a citizen of this city. The reasons given in the original petition are that China's economic situation, the environment of tobacco merchants, and the purchasing power of the people cannot be compared with those of Europe, America, and Japan. If this measure is implemented, disaster relief may not be achieved, and millions more Chinese merchants who rely on the tobacco industry will be harmed, giving foreign merchants an excellent opportunity to invade the market. Not only will the disaster relief bonds not be issued, but also the existing cigarette treasury bond fund will be shaken. It is also said that issuing public bonds for disaster relief is a fundamental mistake, and it is hoped that the government will not set this bad precedent. The petition lists the excessive issuance of public bonds and the excessive issuance of banknotes by various banks as the main reasons for the decline in the value of Chinese silver. These reasons were highly appreciated by the authorities, so the Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Finance to postpone the proposal based on these reasons. The letter from Xie Qi, Director of the Consolidated Tax Bureau, to Bian is as follows: "To Mr. Qihuan, I admire your insightful views. The case has been referred by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan, which has instructed that it be postponed. I am writing to inform you. [Signed] Xie Qi, Director of the Consolidated Tax Bureau."</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Interior and Finance: "To the esteemed Executive Yuan, Ministry of Interior, and Ministry of Finance, the disaster in Shaanxi is in urgent need of relief. Saving lives and burying the dead requires huge amounts of funds. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to issue 8 million yuan in disaster relief bonds. We have heard that the Executive Yuan has forwarded the matter to the Ministries of Interior and Finance to formulate regulations. We earnestly request a prompt decision to issue the bonds as soon as possible to reduce the number of starving people. The well-being of future generations depends on your virtuous governance. We await your instructions with the utmost anticipation. [Signed] Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Disaster and Epidemic in Henan Reported <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>▲Zhang Fang Telegraphs for Relief Funds and Medicine</p>
<p>The natural and man-made disasters in Henan are no less severe than those in Shaanxi. The Relief Committee has recently received repeated telegrams from Zhang Fang of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee, reporting that after the disaster, there is now an epidemic and requesting the urgent raising of relief funds and the requisitioning of medicine. The original telegrams are recorded below: "(1) To Elders Xu Jun and Wang Yilao, the disaster in Henan is the most severe among all provinces. We are grateful for the emergency relief funds allocated previously, which greatly helped. The number of deaths during the winter is countless. We have read in the newspaper that the tobacco treasury bonds have been sold, which is very gratifying. However, the calamity in Jiangxi has not yet subsided, so the funds cannot be distributed there. Shaanxi has been designated to receive a large amount of relief funds. The war in Henan has been devastating, and the people are suffering from snow and ice. Those who have died from cold and hunger are scattered everywhere. Soup kitchens have been set up in Kaifeng and other places, but due to the shortage of funds and the high price of rice, it is difficult to continue. We pray that you will be concerned about the disaster in Henan and allocate 100,000 yuan to separately subsidize and add soup kitchens in various counties to alleviate the spring famine. Saving one person is equivalent to cultivating one unit of vitality for the country. Please use your virtue to benefit the people during this time. [Signed] Zhang Fang, Henan Provincial Relief Committee. (2) To Elder Wang Yilao, an epidemic is raging in western Henan. Many people are infected with diphtheria, measles, typhoid fever, dysentery, and other diseases, and the number of deaths is increasing daily. We pray that you will quickly allocate large sums of money and requisition medicine to save the people. We respectfully request that you find ways to widely solicit donations. [Signed] Zhang Fang, Henan Provincial Relief Committee."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Dispute Over Penalties Imposed by the French Concession Medical Board <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>▲Chinese Medical Association Sends Another Letter to the French Municipal Council</p>
<p>Since the implementation of doctor registration in the French Concession, penalties have been strictly enforced on unregistered doctors. The Chinese medical community believes that the deadline is too short, so the Shanghai Chinese Medical Association sent representatives to the French Municipal Council to lodge a serious protest. They met with Director-General Ai, who promised that the registration deadline would be extended to May 1, and that no penalties would be imposed on those who failed to register by May. On February 27, the Chinese Medical Association received an official letter from the French Municipal Council in French, stating that May 1 would be the deadline. This matter had been successfully negotiated and resolved. However, not long after, Huang Wenhua, a member of the Chinese Medical Association, was suddenly summoned by the French Municipal Council's Health Department the day before yesterday and fined two yuan. The Chinese Medical Association held a meeting to discuss the matter and sent another letter to the French Municipal Council, stating: "To the esteemed Director-General, regarding the regulations on doctors practicing in the Shanghai French Concession issued by your office, especially the articles on registration and fines, our Association has repeatedly raised three points, sent letters to your office, and sent representatives such as Xie Lixuan to request a solution from Director-General Huang. We were promised a solution and received a letter stating that the police had been instructed to refrain from inspections and penalties before May 1. The letter also stated that the regulations would be implemented on May 1, and all doctors, dentists, and veterinarians in the concession would be subject to these regulations. This was announced to the members of our Association in the French Concession. Not only is our Association grateful for your cooperation, but our members are also thankful. However, in recent days, many members in your concession have reported that your office is still urging them to register and imposing arbitrary fines, which is more severe than before. They have requested assistance from our Association. At first, we were skeptical, but on the 5th of this month, it was discovered that several members, including Huang Wenhua, had been fined, and the fine tickets were sent to our Association, which was shocking. It is believed that the implementation will begin on May 1. Since your Director-General had promised our representatives on February 15 and then sent a letter of approval on February 27, why are there arbitrary fines being issued on March 5? This seems to undermine the credibility of our Association and the prestige of your Director-General. Therefore, we are writing to request your Director-General to indicate how the fines imposed on several members for practicing without a license after February 15 will be handled, and whether there will be similar incidents by the police before May 1, so that our Association can explain to our members. We hope that you will investigate and reply."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday: "To the esteemed Association, the Council is now selecting members for the Rent Appraisal Committee to handle disputes over rent assessment for the purpose of collecting property taxes. According to the Land Regulations, the Council may collect taxes based on the assessed rent. However, the actual rent paid is often difficult to determine, and it is necessary to appraise self-occupied properties. The committee is established to handle all appeals against the Council's Property Tax Office's assessment. Its composition includes one representative from the Property Tax Office, one representative from the Public Works Department, one Chinese representative recommended by your Association, and one Japanese representative to be designated by the Japanese community.

<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to various real estate companies that have not yet joined the association yesterday: "To the esteemed companies, we have already sent a special letter to the companies introduced by Mr. So-and-So, including a copy of the association's constitution and a blank membership application form. We trust that you have reviewed them and kindly request that you complete and submit the application form. In the current situation, the association is even more necessary. In addition to actively negotiating on the water supply issue to alleviate the long-standing difficulties and losses of the industry, we are also making progress on property appraisal. We have recently seen in the Council's gazette that the Council has invited the association to recommend an appraiser, which further demonstrates the importance of the association. However, many hands make light work, and unity is strength. If you actively participate, our strength will be greater. Externally, this can prevent the industry from being criticized for lacking a collective body and acting individually. Internally, we can communicate with each other and pool our wisdom. We hope that you will consider this."</p>

<p>At nine o'clock on Tuesday evening, a man checked into the Yuegong Hotel, and the registration book recorded his name as Ma Yusun, from Beiping, 30 years old, working in politics, and arriving from Nanjing. That night, he and a woman shared room 26 on the fourth floor. The next day, this Mr. Ma suddenly told the cashier that his room was too small and not spacious enough, so he wanted to move to a larger one. On Wednesday evening, the two moved down a floor and changed to room 12 on the third floor. From that day on, the man and woman held hands and went out together, often returning late at night. The man wore a Zhongshan suit with an old-fashioned overcoat, while the woman wore a long blue Hua silk georgette qipao. Their clothes were ordinary and did not attract attention at first. However, every time they went out or returned, Ma Yusun would often nod and greet the staff at the cashier's desk. Sometimes the man and woman would go downstairs side by side, laughing and talking, looking very happy. The night before last, around eleven o'clock, Ma and his female companion, laughing and talking, went upstairs. The cashier asked Ma where he was coming from, and Ma replied, "We just came back from seeing a movie. Are you busy?" It was eleven o'clock at the time. After entering the room, Ma suddenly became enthusiastic and ordered a teaboy to summon a Cantonese prostitute to sing a song. The Cantonese song was mournful and moving, and the prostitute's voice was sweet and gentle. After the song ended, Ma applauded in admiration.</p>
<p>▲Writing a New Poem Before Death</p>
<p>The Yuegong Hotel's rules stipulate that teaboys ask guests at 3 PM each day if they wish to extend their stay. When the teaboy asked about room 12 on the third floor, there was no sound inside. The teaboy thought there was a female guest inside and did not dare to enter rashly, so he reported to the cashier for instructions. A certain Mr. Li, the cashier, was enthusiastic and feared something might have happened, so he told the teaboy to try to peek through the small window on the door. The teaboy followed the instructions and used a pole to move the curtains aside, and saw the couple lying motionless on the bed, looking pale. He quickly pried open the door and went inside to touch them. They were still breathing. He immediately hired a car to take them to Tongren Hospital for treatment and reported to the police station in the First District of the Fifth Precinct. The police station sent officers to investigate and found two suicide notes in room 12. One was addressed to the manager, saying, "We are borrowing this place to commit suicide, and we apologize profusely. There is no need for burial, we are grateful. [Signed] Ma Yusun, Bian Juefei." Bian was Ma's female companion. The other letter was addressed to "Gentlemen." Upon opening it, it was neither a letter nor a poem of seven-character quatrains or five-character ancient verse, but a modern poem. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The love in this world,</p>
<p>Is so painful,</p>
<p>Our bodies are burned for this,</p>
<p>To friends who sympathize with us,</p>
<p>Please do not be sad,</p>
<p>This is the vanguard of love,</p>
<p>Sorrow is the true meaning of love,</p>
<p>We wish you health,</p>
<p>We enclose our souls,</p>
<p>We bid you farewell,</p>
<p>Ma Yusun, Bian Juefei, written at the moment of death,</p>
<p>12:15, March 6, 1931.</p>
<p>Ma Yusun died shortly after arriving at the hospital, while Bian Juefei was in critical condition and also near death. As for the poison they took, it was thought to be an anesthetic powder, resembling icing sugar, wrapped in thin paper. A certain Mr. Li, out of curiosity, tasted it with his tongue and said that it was extremely bitter and he did not have the courage to swallow it.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Misunderstandings After Resolution <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday morning all tram lines were suspended</p>
<p>▲ Service only resumed after 1 PM</p>
<p>Regarding the conflict between Chinese Commercial Tramway workers and naval aircraft artisans, the company's Route 4 and Route 1 trams were immediately shortened to South Railway Station. After mediation by various parties, a resolution was reached the night before last. Details were published in this newspaper. However, yesterday morning, due to the union's failure to issue a notification, the tram workers mistakenly believed the resolution had fallen through, and therefore did not report to work, resulting in the suspension of all Chinese Commercial Tramway lines in the southern city yesterday morning. It wasn't until they realized the situation and the union issued a notice ordering workers to return to work that service resumed around noon. Consequently, the vehicles did not leave the factory until after 1 PM. The details of the misunderstanding are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Resumption of Service: The day before yesterday, the Tramway Company and the Tramway Workers' Union, under the responsibility of Mayor Zhang Qun, accepted the three demands raised by the workers and issued a proclamation, immediately resuming service. Subsequently, as the Public Security Bureau required over a hundred copies of the proclamation and writing and printing took time, it was not delivered to the company until 8 PM. At that time, Wang Zijing, the Second District Chief of the Public Security Bureau, also led fifty members of the security team to maintain order in the Gaochang Temple area. However, the union's staff and standing directors had left for the night. With only a little over two hours remaining before the tram entered the factory, the workers, seeing the proclamation and the police maintaining order, immediately resumed service, reaching Gaochang Temple, effectively restoring normal operations.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday Morning's Misunderstanding: The next morning, the union staff had to arrive after 8 AM. Furthermore, the workers who worked the previous night and those who worked the following morning had not met. Until yesterday morning, the union believed that since service had resumed the previous night, the following morning would be normal. However, the workers, seeing that the trams had resumed service last (the day before yesterday) night, but due to the lack of time, no notice had been issued, wondered why no notice had appeared this morning, leading to suspicion and the belief that negotiations had broken down. Consequently, they delayed reporting to the factory, and vehicles could not depart as usual. Upon realizing the situation, the Social Bureau sent Xu Zhi from the Third Section, Wang Zijing, the Second District Chief of the Public Security Bureau, and Officer Niu to the company to investigate the true reason for the suspension. The company was also summoning the union's standing committee members Zhu Hanhe, Zhou Guangrong, Fang Ronggen, and Xu Wangsheng for questioning. It was then discovered that the suspension was due to a misunderstanding. The union's standing committee immediately issued a notice, and vehicles only resumed normal service after 1 PM. Maintaining Order: After the trams on Routes 1 and 4 resumed direct service to Gaochang Temple, the Public Security Bureau's security team dispatched a total of fifty officers, divided into shifts of twenty-five, patrolling in sections. Eight officers were stationed in front of the Tramway Company's gate, eight in front of Gaochang Temple, and the rest accompanied the trams to provide protection. The deployment is expected to be withdrawn after today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ Retaining Negotiation: While tram service has resumed, the injured tram workers remain in the hospital, and their injuries have not improved. Therefore, the union's standing committee members Zhu Hanhe and others, when meeting with Manager Lu Bohong at the company yesterday morning, requested preferential treatment for the injured and insisted on serious negotiations regarding the perpetrators to bring them to justice in the local court. Lu agreed to do his best to proceed with the matter.</p>
<p>▲ Service Resumption Notice: Yesterday, to explain the misunderstanding, the union issued a notice, stating: "Regarding the notice, our members, after being assaulted, abandoned the route. Yesterday, thanks to the Mayor's order, the Public Security Bureau issued a proclamation to ensure safety. Unexpectedly, the union did not see the proclamation issued until 8 PM last night. By the time the proclamation arrived, there were no responsible personnel at the union, which led to a misunderstanding and the cessation of work this morning. Now that the misunderstanding has been explained, we hope that all members will abide by the order and restore the original route traffic. We will continue to pursue subsequent matters. This is the notice."</p>

<p>▲ It is Wu Baoxian, sentenced to ten years</p>
<p>▲ Described the Incident in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>It has been fifteen years since the assassination of Mr. Chen Qimei. The case was reopened and attracted attention from both the government and the public after Nie Dianbang (also known as Nie Zhenbang) was arrested in Shanghai on January 6. Chairman Chiang ordered the Shanghai court to transfer Nie to Beijing and instructed Chen Enpu, a military judge from the General Headquarters, to come to Shanghai to investigate the evidence for review and handling. Later, it was heard that the case did not require military trial, so Nie was transferred from the General Headquarters to the Jiangning District Court for investigation and prosecution according to law. Now, the Jiangning Court learned that Nie had an accomplice, Wu Baoxian from Jingjiang, who had committed another theft case and was sentenced to ten years in prison by the Special District Court and imprisoned in the Tilanqiao Prison. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Special Court requesting a nearby inquiry. Yang, the President of the Special Court, notified the police. Yesterday morning, Wu was brought from the prison to the First Court. A witness was summoned. After being questioned by Judge Xu Jiashi, the witness stated that he used to live in Xinmin Lane on Avenue Joffre and was a neighbor of Chen Qimei. At 4 PM on May 18, he suddenly heard gunshots. He quickly went out to see that the defendants Wu Baoxian and Nie Dianbang were each holding a pistol and running out of Chen's residence. As they approached him, they shouted, "Get out of the way!" Before the incident, Nie and Wu often came to his shop to chat, so he knew them. He believed that their intention in coming to the shop was to gather information to take action when the opportunity arose. After the interrogation, Judge Xu instructed Wu Baoxian to be sent back to prison and to reply to the Jiangning District Court according to the situation for review and handling.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Fierce Competition Among Taxi Companies <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>▲ Lowering prices to attract customers; gasoline is expensive</p>
<p>▲ Five companies have closed since March</p>
<p>▲ Foreign firms reap the benefits</p>
<p>There are more than 120 taxi companies with over 1,100 taxis for hire in this city. Competition among them has always been fierce, but never as much as in the past three months. Now, the taxi companies are fighting each other like snipes and clams, while foreign taxi companies reap the benefits. Smaller companies have been affected by the competition and have been closing down one after another. The following is based on investigations conducted by the Daily News reporter from various sources:</p>
<p>▲ Cause of Competition: Of the more than 120 taxi companies in the city, less than half have strong capital. Most of the smaller companies pay only 20% of the price when purchasing cars from foreign firms, with the remaining 80% paid in monthly installments. However, the terms of the contract are very harsh. If a company cannot pay off the installments on time, the foreign firm will take back the car. Therefore, the only hope for companies that have purchased cars is to attract customers, develop their business, and pay off the outstanding installments on time. Thus, the practice of lowering prices to attract customers and competition among companies gradually arose.</p>
<p>▲ Gradually Intensifying: In mid-November last year, as gasoline prices gradually increased, it became difficult for companies to maintain competitiveness. The preparatory meeting of the Taxi Industry Association resolved two items: (1) to advise companies to stop competing by lowering prices; (2) to raise the price of taxi fares uniformly, such as raising the price of a ride that costs one yuan to 1.5 yuan, and raising the price of a chartered car from three yuan per hour to four yuan. However, a few companies did not implement this resolution, and the larger Huang Taxi Company also joined the competition, continuing to charge the old prices. Members once advised them, but the matter was not resolved. Therefore, Yunfei Taxi Company, a standing committee member of the preparatory meeting of the industry association, joined the fray, and competition became even more intense.</p>
<p>▲ Foreigners Reaping the Benefits: Since the beginning of December last year until now, Huang Taxi Company and Yunfei Taxi Company have been competing fiercely, and it has not stopped. Seeing that gold prices are rising daily and that taxi companies are competing with each other, the sales volume of gasoline in Shanghai has also increased daily. Therefore, they continue to raise prices, reaping the benefits. For example, the total amount of gasoline needed in Shanghai each month is more than 500,000 gallons. Last year, the lowest price per gallon was 41 cents, but now it has risen to 1.25 yuan per gallon. However, the price of taxi fares has been raised by smaller companies, while larger companies remain the same. Business losses are inevitable.</p>
<p>▲ Closing Down One After Another: For the sake of competing in business, larger companies keep their fares the same. Smaller companies have no choice but to implement the previous resolution of the industry association and raise prices, but business is slow, and losses are even greater. Therefore, since March, five companies have been affected by the competition and have closed down: Meili on Pingliang Road, Huaqiao on North Sichuan Road, Shunda, Sanxing on Avenue Edward VII, and Fuxing. There are still more than 40 companies that are barely surviving despite significant losses. If competition continues, they will also be severely affected and close down one after another.</p>
<p>▲ Final Mediation: Seeing that members are fighting like snipes and clams again, which will lead to complete destruction and mutual harm, the preparatory meeting of the industry association decided to convene a meeting of all members in the next few days to discuss and make a final mediation, first to unify the prices of taxi fares, agree on appropriate penalties for violators, and then seek the development of the future of the industry.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government previously resolved to build civilian residences in the city annually. The Second Civilian Residence, planned for construction in the 19th year, consists of 400 rooms and is located in the middle of Xietu Road and Rue Lubin.

<p>▲ Li Maolin Firmly Denies</p>
<p>▲ Sentence of Temporary Detention; Rescheduled for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested seven thieves who developed electric guns on the evening of the 5th in Yongqing Lane near Xiaobeimen. Details have been published in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, one of the seven criminals, Wang Yaoting, suddenly confessed to the assassination of An Zhendong, the Fourth District Inspector of Zhabei. Wang confessed that there were four people involved and that they were all instigated by Li Maolin, the owner of Liangxi Inn located at No. 45 Hubei Road in the Public Concession. He also claimed that Li gave Wang and others 100 yuan on Fuzhou Road at that time.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Upon hearing the confession, Captain Lu immediately reported to Director Chen, who ordered Squad Leader Qi Haitain to deliver the document to the Old Gate Police Station and dispatch Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Li at the address. He was temporarily detained at the police station. At 9 AM yesterday morning, Judge Zhou opened the First Criminal Court for a preliminary hearing at the Special District Court. The Public Security Bureau specially sent Squad Leader Qi along with the criminal Wang to testify in court. Li also hired lawyer Fan Gang for his defense. Judge Zhou first asked the criminal Wang about his age and origin. Then, Wang confessed that he was one of the four assassins who assassinated Inspector An and that they were all instigated by Li. When questioned, Li Maolin completely denied it. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi also appeared in court and stated that Wang's confession was inconsistent and that Li had been living in the concession for 36 years without any criminal record. If the mainland wanted to extradite him, concrete evidence was required. Detective Squad Leader Qi also rose and said that it was inappropriate for Attorney Ru to think the existence of the crime was tied to the length of residence, even if residents had lived in the Chinese district for decades, they could not escape punishment if they were to commit a crime. At the same time, Li's lawyer Fan Gang requested bail, but the court did not grant it and ordered temporary detention, with the hearing rescheduled for next Tuesday.</p>

<p>▲ Invited the U.S. Commercial Counselor to Speak</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1 PM, the Tsinghua Alumni Association on Beijing Road invited the U.S. Commercial Counselor Julean Arnold to speak and held a luncheon. More than 30 people including Xu Peihuang, Lu Meiseng, and Lin Rongqing attended. After the banquet, Chairman Shi Boqun stood up to introduce Arnold's speech, which stated that to seek the development of foreign trade, we must first pay attention to the revitalization of domestic trade. China is a country rich in special products, but it is a pity that little attention has been paid to rectification. For example, the former forbidden areas in Peiping have been opened due to the shift of the political center. We should find ways to increase tourists and make it a commercial area. Another example is Hangzhou's scenic spots, which are world-renowned, but there are very few tourists in the cold winter. Therefore, it is necessary to use scientific methods to improve the material conditions so that tourists can enjoy themselves regardless of the season, and commerce will also develop accordingly. It was decided that Zhao Shifu and Wang Zhiya would succeed the original executive committee members Li Da and Wu Xizhi, who were going to Tianjin and Hankou.</p>

<p>▲ The Pregnant Woman is Well</p>
<p>▲ Police Misunderstanding</p>
<p>▲ Court Approves Dismissal</p>
<p>The recent accusation against the Chinese-Western Pharmacy on the Fourth Road by the Old Gate Police for negligence has attracted much attention in Shanghai. Yesterday (Saturday) morning, the court summoned various witnesses and learned that the pregnant woman, Guo Zhou, had taken the medicine and felt a slight reaction. This was a sign that the medicine was working and should not have caused alarm. However, she was unfamiliar with medicine and became fearful, secretly reporting it to the police for investigation. Unexpectedly, she soon recovered and realized that it was not the fault of the pharmacy. The police did not know the details, which led to the lawsuit. The judge, understanding the situation, ruled that since it was a misunderstanding, it should be dismissed. The plaintiff and defendant were all satisfied and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Jiuchang and Dongbaochang Settle Lawsuit <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Bao Chengliang, Dong Shengzheng, Tongyu, and others operating a fruit and local goods business at No. 16 Pu. The location of the business was originally the property of the China Merchants Bureau and was leased by Jiuchang Company. The company thus exercised its rights as the landlord. The business feared that the location would be taken by others, and they would lose their place of business. Therefore, the tenants united to form Dongbaochang Jingzu Chenfang and leased the entire property from Jiuchang Company. However, according to the lease terms, the tenants were obligated to invest in construction. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Municipal Government renovated Fangbang Middle Road and Qingshui Road. The location of the business was directly affected and workers were hired to renovate it. However, they had to pay 25,000 yuan for the road construction fee to the Municipal Finance Bureau. This road construction fee should have been paid by the landlord, the China Merchants Bureau. However, they delayed payment, so the Jingzu Chenfang paid it on their behalf and deducted it from the rent owed to Jiuchang Company. After it was deducted, Jiuchang Company suddenly refused to recognize the road construction fee and filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court against Dongbaochang for rent arrears, demanding termination of the lease. Dongbaochang and the tenants also suffered significant losses as the new house had just been completed. They hired lawyers and filed a counterclaim. The court has repeatedly summoned them, and they have now settled in court. Here is a record of the settlement: Jiangsu Shanghai District Court Settlement Record: Plaintiff: Jiuchang Company; Legal Representative: Wang Shiqiang; Lawyer: Lu Shaozong; Defendant: Dongbaochang Jingzu Zhangfang: Zheng Feizhang, Sun Shiyuan, Dong Chunxue; Agents: Zheng Gengyu, Zhou Xiaoan, Zhu Sifu; Regarding the case of breach of contract between the parties listed above, the content of the settlement reached by the court in court (1) Both parties acknowledge that the lease contract signed between Jiuchang Company and Dongbaochang on the 29th day of the month in the 17th year of the Republic of China is valid. The agent of Jiuchang Company also acknowledges that the request for termination will be withdrawn immediately. (2) The road construction fee of 25,000 yuan should be borne by the landlord, China Merchants Bureau, according to the defendant's claim. Now the agent of the plaintiff, representing the plaintiff, acknowledges to advance 15,000 yuan, which will be deducted from the 25,000 yuan advanced by the defendant. The defendant's agent also represents the defendant to advance 10,000 yuan. Both parties will jointly negotiate with the China Merchants Bureau. All expenses will be borne equally by both parties. Regardless of the situation, both parties must cooperate and must not shirk responsibility. (3) The 6,324 yuan paid by the defendant to the Municipal Government for the coupon tax rent for November 12 of the 19th year of the Republic of China is approved by the plaintiff's agent on behalf of the plaintiff to be deducted from the rent owed. However, the defendant must also deliver the aforementioned receipt to the plaintiff before March 24. If the receipt is insufficient, cash should be paid according to the amount. (4) The rent requested by the plaintiff, from January 16 of the 19th year of the Republic of China to February 15 of the 20th year of the Republic of China, totals thirteen months, totaling 41,106 yuan. In addition to the 15,000 yuan for the road construction fee advanced by the plaintiff and the 6,324 yuan for the borrowed coupon tax rent, the amount due is 19,782 yuan, which must be paid in full before March 24 without delay. (9) The plaintiff acknowledges that the interest on the rent arrears, the defendant acknowledges that the interest on the advance payment, and other losses before the litigation are waived by both parties and will not be pursued. (6) The litigation costs of this case shall be borne by each party.</p>

<p>▲ Issuing Type B Gift Certificates</p>
<p>The Savings Department of the China National Bank has previously issued Type A gift certificates. In addition to being redeemable for cash at the bank's head office and branches in Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, and Guangdong, they can also be used to purchase goods at full face value at the Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun department stores. Type B gift certificates have now been issued, which are bound into books. The interest is earned by the certificate purchaser, and the effectiveness is the same as Type A. They can also be used as traveler's checks and certified checks. Detailed regulations are printed for people to ask for. Recently, as the savings business of commercial firms has not been legalized and is still in a state of suspension, it is convenient to use the China National Bank's gift certificates to pay when shopping at major companies to avoid carrying cash.</p>

They immediately sent staff to Hankou to conduct on-site investigation and found that the counterfeit goods were purchased from Tongchang Company. They then sent a friend to purchase a box, and the price was lower. When they opened the can and tasted it, they found that it was mixed with some kind of miscellaneous material, accounting for about half of the weight, and it was salty. Therefore, they immediately filed a lawsuit with the Hankou District Court, summoning a friend from Zihao to testify in court. The friend confessed that the goods were purchased from Qi Qing in Baohe Lane. Qi was then arrested and confessed to the fact that he had counterfeited for profit. It is heard that Qi has been sentenced to detention for the crime of fraud.</p>

<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>Numbers from one to ten, hundred, thousand, and ten thousand all represent a fixed quantity. They are rigid and definite, and nothing can replace them. However, the number "two" is different. Sometimes we see "pair," "double," "repeat," "again," "inserted," and "combined" words challenging its position. As a result, the word "two" loses its ability to govern. It is common to overlook this through habit, but once pointed out, it becomes quite interesting. For example, when counting hours, we say "one o'clock" and "two o'clock," but we don't say "two o'clock." However, when it comes to twelve o'clock, we can't say "ten-two o'clock." When counting people using "ge," the Tang poem says, "Two orioles sing amid the willow branches." A common saying is, "Two monks have water to carry." We can't say "two ge." The two hands, two feet, two eyebrows, two eyes, and two ears of the human body can all be referred to as "double," but never "two." If you offer something with both hands, you say "present with both hands," not "present with two hands." We say "frowning with both eyebrows," not "frowning with two eyebrows." When referring to people, we say "a couple" or "a pair of brothers," "two sisters," "two sisters-in-law," or "two daughters-in-law," but in reality, it's always two people. When referring to places, we say "two rivers," "two major rivers," "two lakes," "Guangdong and Guangxi," "Zhejiang and Jiangsu," or "Sichuan." Other examples include a snake with two heads, a horse with two companions, a bow with two stones, a boat with two oars, a temple with two pillars, a house with two corridors, a dress with two sleeves, and a hairpin with two prongs. Nothing can be both great. You can't have both. Events branch in two directions. Intentions can be two-sided. Movement leads to two losses. Combination causes two injuries. All these belong to the meaning of "two," but the word "two" is absolutely not used. National Day, October 10th, is celebrated as the "Twentieth," but we don't call it the "Twentieth Festival," but rather the "Double Tenth Festival." As for the ninth day of the ninth month, we call it "Double Ninth" or "Double Yang," not "Two Nines" or "Two Yangs." "Double" and "repeat" are used instead of "two." One, two, and three are naturally sequential numbers. However, in the I Ching's Meng Hexagram, "the first divination is clear, repeated divinations are annoying," we say "repeated divinations," not "two-three divinations." Ji Wenzi thought three times before acting, and Confucius responded, "Two thoughts are enough," but we say "think again." Therefore, the word "two" is also invaded by the word "again" in some parts. For example, "once and again," "again and again," "think over and over again," "consider carefully again and again," "repeatedly remind," as well as various "rebirths," "re-creations," "re-comings," and "re-attempts," all convey the meaning of "two." This is similar to the phrases "three words and two sentences" in writing, "three cups and two small cups" of wine, and "two or three branches of peach blossoms outside the bamboo," using "two" to replace "two" in a similar way. The lotus has two stems, which could be called "two-stem lotus," but instead, it's called "twin-stem lotus." A boat has two boards, which could be called a "two-board boat," but instead, it's called a "sandwiched-board boat." Instances like these are endless. Why is the word "two" so unfortunate to encounter such entanglement?</p>

<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>In modern times, among those who paint flowers, the world recognizes Cheng Yaosheng as the best. However, Master Cheng initially had no intention of painting. With his outstanding talent, he unintentionally broke into the field of painting, which is a good story. Master Cheng's name is Zhang, from Huizhou. Many people from Huizhou engage in the pawnshop business, so Master Cheng also entered a pawnshop as an apprentice in his youth. After a while, he realized that the profession was not worth learning. He devoted himself to studying physics and natural sciences, eventually mastering them. He then became a teacher in a school. One day, while teaching about rose flowers, he could not find a specimen. He then showed the students a painting he had made, which he had sketched at a friend's house a month before. When the painting was displayed, the students were amazed by its realism. They then asked him to paint for them, and his colleagues also made requests. Soon, friends and acquaintances heard the news and came to ask for paintings. The paper piled up like a mountain, and he could not fulfill all the requests. Someone said to him, "You are working too hard for others. Why not set a price and limit the number of requests?" Master Cheng followed their advice. Once the price was set, even more people came to ask for paintings, creating a scene like a bustling market in front of his door. As a result, he resigned from his teaching position and devoted himself to painting. He increased his prices every year, but the demand remained the same. A painting of a small size could fetch as much as ten gold pieces.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Mermaid <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Qian</p>
<p>This startling news happened in a small village named Picaoa five years ago. On the outskirts of the town, near the sea, there was a small inn called Panandiss. No one in the nearby population did not know that there were two mermaids in the hotel. One was named Joa Panandiss, and the other was named Baba Panandiss. One day, Qi Erjia Tai (the friend of the inn owner) and him (the owner) talked about politics. He later sat alone at home. All of a sudden, he came back and brought new news: "I saw a beautiful mermaid. Are you happy to go and watch it?" Therefore, they headed to the destination.</p>
<p>On a very clear, moonlit night, a number of villagers were cutting wood along the coast. They stood by Baba's habitat. By the time the night was about to end, only the water of the Atlantic Ocean trickled by itself. The shore was inlaid with a thicket of stones. "Here it comes." They quietly stood up.</p>
<p>One minute, two minutes passed. Nothing was seen. Only the sky that was toppled into the water, the silver moon. Only the sound of splashing water was heard. And then she appeared in the sea. First, the head was seen, along, long hair, draped to the shoulder. The exquisite chest was exposed until the scaly tail. She bent her tail very slowly, sitting on the rocks. She was truly a mermaid.</p>
<p>They were captivated by this water deity of the sea, and discussed the phenomena they had seen. The mermaid heard their voices and quickly dove into the water. And then it was again quiet.</p>
<p>This had happened five years ago. After this, the mermaid had been discovered several times. After this news spread, countless people came to this small hotel to watch. One night, she came again, and brought a companion with her. Ten minutes later, they began to play with each other. The front of the small hotel became like Shanyin Road. A new Panandiss Hotel was built, and the old owner greatly benefited.</p>
<p>For five years, the mermaid of Picaoa attracted customers for the hotel. Night after night, onlookers stood on the shore, hoping to see the beautiful monster. A lot of people only saw a scaly tail in the night, like an ephemeral bloom, and so became greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>But recently, detectives came out. Baba Panandiss was the most strange hoax of modern times. It turns out that the mermaid was his daughter. One night, the mermaid was playing to be watched by the guests. A police ship stealthily sailed out of the harbor. The mermaid heard the sound, and quickly dove into the water. But the police ship waited for them to surface before catching them in one fell swoop. She was indeed the owner's daughter, Tan Lisi. She had a very exquisite fish tail on her leg, and was wearing a nude-colored swimsuit. Her friend was a waitress in the Panandiss hotel.</p>
<p>Because Tan Lisi could swim in the water with her feet together, just like a fish. When the matter was decided, his wife, Malai, made this strange tail. And so this strange event was created.</p>
<h3 id="e175">A Record of Coincidences in a Bandit's Lair <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Fu</p>
<p>A guest returned from the Six Counties and recounted the story of a bandit's wife rescuing a hostage. It was quite interesting, so I quickly recorded it to share with readers.</p>
<p>Our county is known for its banditry. The problem with bandits is not so much robbery as it is kidnapping for ransom. The ransom demanded is often enormous, leading to the ruin of even moderately wealthy families. If the family cannot afford to pay, the bandits often kill the hostage and send the body to their door as a warning to those who are stingy with their money. Their cruelty is such. A resident of the county, a wealthy man, had only one son. On the night of his wedding, the bandits heard of it and, armed with weapons, broke down the gate and entered. They looted all the property but were still not satisfied. They then kidnapped his beloved son and left. Afterward, they demanded 20,000 gold pieces for his ransom. The man, deeply concerned for his son, tried his best to raise the money, but in such a short time, it was difficult to gather such a large sum. The bandits suspected him of being stingy and refused to lower the price, so the matter stalled. The bandits repeatedly threatened him, stating in a letter that if the ransom was not paid by the next day, they would kill the hostage. The man, though alarmed, had no way to raise the money and resigned himself to despair. The matter came to the knowledge of the new bride, who, believing that her husband had no hope of returning alive, committed suicide out of grief. Unexpectedly, late that night, the man's son suddenly returned home with a young woman, looking very flustered. The man was overjoyed and eagerly inquired about what had happened. The man's son pointed to the young woman who had come with him and said, "This woman is my savior." He then recounted in detail how he was rescued. It turned out that after the man's son was taken to the bandit's lair, the bandits often went out, leaving only one bandit to guard the hostage. Among them was a female bandit, about twenty years old, with a beautiful appearance. She would occasionally come to visit him, seeming to have deep feelings for him. Over time, they exchanged secret words. She described herself as a native of Yongcheng in Henan, who had also been kidnapped by the bandits. Because the ransom demanded was too high, her family could not afford to pay, so she was trapped among the bandits. As she spoke, she sobbed. The man's son felt sympathy for her but did not dare to believe her. He simply listened to her. That night, the woman suddenly came and told him, "Tonight, all the bandits have gone out as agreed. There is only one bandit guarding the hostage, and he is fast asleep. Is this not a good opportunity for you to escape?" The man's son suspected it was a trap and did not fully trust her. The woman said, "Time is running out." She then took him and fled. After escaping the bandit's lair, the man's son said, "How can I repay you?" The woman said, "I am from a good family and cannot bear to serve bandits. Now that I have escaped the bandit's lair, I have no face to return to my hometown. If you do not despise me, I am willing to entrust my life to you." The man found out her true feelings and was both saddened and happy. Saddened that his daughter-in-law had died, and happy that he had gained a new daughter-in-law. He praised her righteousness and agreed to her request. Fearing retaliation from the bandits, he moved his family to another place, and their whereabouts are unknown.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Preserving Youth with Skilful Makeup, Continuing Life with Costly Efforts.</p>
<p>Hua Yuanchun stayed in a hotel for ten days after arriving in Beijing. In the Beijing hutongs, this was called "opening the market." The opening days were when the guests would go all out to support the event. Many "red girls" would open the market for ten days consecutively, with a minimum of three days of feasting. Hua Yuanchun, being a famous Shanghai "red girl" and the top attraction at Qingyutang, was given the best room in the front courtyard and told that she would not be seeing guests, as a special case. The manager also instructed the staff to follow Shanghai customs, calling her "Sixth Miss" instead of addressing her as "So-and-so Miss" with her full name. This was to treat her with the preferential treatment afforded to "red girls" from the south. Naturally, a group of wealthy gentlemen would greet and welcome Hua Yuanchun upon her arrival. The opening was supposed to be celebrated with a bang, but unfortunately, she wasn't so lucky. She asked a few acquaintances from Shanghai, but some had already left Beijing for other assignments, and others had already found someone among the girls from the south. They could only offer perfunctory support. She had been expecting Ye Tonghou to arrive within a week, but he was held up by business in Shanghai. Inviting guests in the Beijing hutongs was different from the parlors in Shanghai, where there were people who would gather a crowd or buy tickets. All expenses, such as rickshaw fares and tips for the servants, were borne by the host. Some extravagant friends did not consider the host's finances and would call for three or four girls at once. If all the guests at the table were like that, the expenses for tips alone would be considerable. In addition to the expenses for cars, carriages, and meals for the guests, a feast could easily cost three hundred yuan. Therefore, it was not easy to find someone to invite guests. Hua Yuanchun barely managed to gather three guests, and she made a splash for three days during the opening. This would have been acceptable for ordinary girls, but the pot-bellied manager, who was impressed by Hua Laoliu's reputation as a Shanghai "red girl" and had heard that she had acquaintances in Beijing, thought that she would be able to continue for at least a week. He was somewhat disappointed that it only lasted three days, and that those three days were only perfunctory. However, he still believed that she was new to the north and didn't know many people. He thought that a girl like her would still be popular and wouldn't fall out of favor so quickly. The way of entertaining in Beijing was slightly different from that in Shanghai. Shanghai was, after all, a large commercial center, and even the customers of the brothels had a bit of a commercial smell to them. Therefore, the Masters Zhang and Masters Li were willing to spend money, but they were very shrewd. The money they spent on the girls was commensurate with the situation, just like in business. Beijing society was a political society, with a large number of political figures. They believed in a certain doctrine and devoted all their energy to it. Similarly, when they patronized a girl, they were willing to devote all their energy to it in order to win her favor, they were willing to spend more money. Therefore, for the few popular "red girls" in Beijing, as long as they captured one or two powerful patrons, the rest were insignificant.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Gold Market Shows Slight Advantage <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲ Turbulence Continues The gold market on March 7th saw a slight increase in prices, but the volatility remained high, with fluctuations of ten taels in a short period. Sentiment remained uneasy, and trading among merchants was varied. Hongli, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Xingyu, and others were on the buying side, while Yuanmao, Yongtaixing, Wanwenshunli, and others were mostly selling. Overseas silver markets also showed gains, but the market conditions were not firm, with strong selling interest from the United States. This led to a reversal in gold prices, opening higher. Although the foreign exchange rate increased slightly, the domestic market showed the opposite trend, with a wider difference between foreign and domestic prices. However, buyers in the market persisted, pushing the price up to over 746 taels at one point. Later, due to looser "ticket" conditions, especially the poor situation within the country and various rumors, major players tended to sell, causing a sharp drop of ten taels. Hengxing, Xingyu, Qianchangxiang, and others took advantage of this drop to buy, and the exchange rate also stabilized, suddenly rising sharply by ten taels, again exceeding the forty-tael mark. In the afternoon, the market closed due to Saturday, and the spot red premium increased to over nine taels. Since the market had been quite turbulent in the past week, turning from good to weak, the twists and turns of over forty taels in these six days were indeed significant. Overall, the price fell by twenty-four taels. It is said that this morning, the big bars or spring season will open lower.</p>
<p>▲ Erratic Fluctuations The April opening price was 743 taels, up six taels. The big bars increased by 5/16, the silver price increased by 5/8, and the private telegraph rate also increased by 9/16. However, selling exceeded buying, and sentiment was firm. Later, prices fluctuated constantly, from 42 to 4. Wanxing, Hengxing, Yuanfu, Yu, and others sold, bringing the price down to 39.5 taels. However, the exchange rate was stable, and the bank's initial offer was 130.625, then 13, with Yuancheng, Hengyu, and others buying, gradually rising to 67.9 and 20 minutes past, reaching 46 taels. Then, it dropped slightly by one tael, and the announcement was made at 44 taels and 5 qian, with the listed price increasing by 20 and a half. From the initial gold change, it increased from 42 to 50 taels. Within a few minutes, the Japanese gold also listed at 2.75%, but there were still many sellers, and it immediately fell to 38.5 taels. Later, Yuda, Yongfeng, Zhifeng, Yong, and others competed to buy, especially because Mitsui bought March English gold at 3 pence, boosting the market and reaching 7 taels. At 10:00, it was 45 taels and 5 qian. Then, the wheat company and Shanghai bought May and June at 130.625, and Fuchang, Taichang, Hengxing, Yuan, Qianchangxiang, and others successively sold, making people anxious. With English gold at 1.31875, the bank had no intention to buy, so the market price plummeted, dropping sharply by 12-13 taels, to 32.5 taels at around 11:00. Suddenly, Hengxing, Yu, and others rushed to buy, and the price suddenly eased. Mitsui bought April English gold at 1.875, and Dongya bought 1.125. Within this half hour, it jumped ten taels, reaching 42 taels and 5 qian, then retreating by three taels. After 11:30, it regained its peak. Buying on the market exceeded selling, and April English gold only settled at 3 pence and 0.625, increasing to 45 taels. At that time, retail investors sold. At the noon close, it was 42 taels and 5 qian, an increase of 5.5 taels compared to the previous day. Later, it traded at 41-42 taels, and finally around three taels. The maximum price in the half-day was 46 taels and 3 qian, and the minimum price was 32 taels and 5 qian, with a difference of 13 taels and 8 qian. Goods opened at 41 taels in the morning and closed at 42 taels and 5 qian at noon. The announced price was changed to 791 taels and 4 qian, deducting 46 to 589 taels. At noon, it was 50 taels, registered at 36 taels, 42 taels, and replenished with 36 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Varied Transactions Transactions among peers were still active. Zhifeng, Yong, Dacheng, Yu, Chunyuan Yong, Hengxing, Hongli, Yuancheng Yuxing Yong all entered, and Qianchangxiang, Futaiting, Hengyu, Tongchun, Yiyu, Yuantai, and others had considerable transactions. Taixing, Yuanmao Yong, Shunli, Hengxing, Yuanwanxing, and Fuyu all exited. Yuanheng and Fuchang first exited and then entered. The Guangdong gang entered hundreds of bars, and the Dalian gang exited 3,000 bars and entered 4500 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Foreign Exchange Shows Divergent Trends <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the English, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported gains, but buyers were not happy, and sellers were enthusiastic. The English exchange rate fell by 0.0625, the American exchange rate fell by 0.09375, and the Yokohama Kobe market was sluggish. The HSBC listed exchange rates all increased by one block, indicating a trend of sharp increases in the silver market. English gold increased by 25, to 1 shilling and 2 pence 875. American gold increased by half a yuan, to 30.125 yuan. Indian gold increased by 1.25 yuan, to 83 rupees 25. Dutch exchange increased by 1.25 yuan, to 75. German exchange increased by 2 yuan, to 126 marks and a half. Singapore exchange decreased by 3.5 yuan, to 186.5 yuan. Japanese exchange decreased by 2.75%, to 1.6 yuan and 4.25. Hong Kong was still 77.75 (no market). However, the bank's domestic market was initially firm but later loosened, and then stabilized at noon. As a result, English gold shrunk by 0.0625 compared to the previous night, American gold shrunk by 1.125, and the Japanese exchange rate increased by one point. This divergence between bright and dark markets was because the gold price had rebounded and had escaped the 740-tael range. The silver market actually had a downward trend, and Chinese merchants in the gold business were still selling to convert back into gold. The transaction volume of English gold was approximately 200,000 pounds. The bank entered and exited intermittently, causing market fluctuations. Mitsui, China-Belgium, Shanghai Wheat Company, Yili, Dongya, and others all made entries. Sumitomo Shanghai also sold slightly, but the amount was not large. Each bank also traded tens of thousands of pounds among themselves, and China-Italy still had a good appetite. American gold had a small number of entries and exits, and Japanese gold also only had a few hundred thousand yuan of transactions. Mitsui and Inoue made purchases. In the afternoon, the market was closed due to the weekly Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Overseas Silver Markets Continue to Strengthen <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>According to the London telegraph yesterday, the price of large-scale silver repeatedly increased, such as a recent sharp increase of 3.525, to 13 pence and 3125 (equivalent to English gold at 1 shilling and 3 pence 625). The forward price also increased by 3125, totaling 13 pence and 25. There were slight purchases in India, but the transaction volume was scarce. Buyers were content, and the market was uncertain. After the close, market conditions were quiet, and the United States was inclined to sell. According to the New York telegraph, the price of American silver also increased by 0.625, with the spot price at 28.5 cents. The exchange rate between English and American silver decreased by 0.09375, to 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, and 32 parts out of 23. The exchange rate between American and English silver fell by 0.03125, to 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, and 75. The exchange rate between Japanese and American silver was still 49.4375 yuan, and the exchange rate between English and Japanese silver was still 2 shillings and 0.4375. The Shanghai shilling increased by 5.625, to 1 shilling and 3 pence 5625. The Mumbai spot price increased by 16 annas, to 43 rupees 05 annas. All Reuters and Telecommunication Agency reports from the morning remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Yesterday, it was Saturday, and the banks were closed in the afternoon, so the atmosphere was particularly quiet. The price for overseas commissions in the money market was 7 qian, 2 fen, and 3 li, a slight decrease of 1 hao and 2 hu and a half compared to the previous day. Silver clearing was still a white loan. The transaction volume for overseas remittances and drafts was 1.36 million. There were no transactions in banknotes. There were 110,000 in outside banknotes, and the banks bought and sold 550,000. The banks received and paid over 900,000 in foreign accounts, and received and paid over 1 million in banknotes.

<p>▲ Market Conditions Slightly Improve, Transaction Volume Approximately 11.1 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market and futures market remained buoyant in the morning. The transaction volume between the two sessions reached 6.56 million. However, market sentiment significantly calmed down in the afternoon, with a transaction volume of only 4.4 million. Furthermore, spot transactions for various bonds were mostly stagnant, with scarce turnover. At the opening this morning, the market situation differed from the previous day. Investment interest in the market was stronger than before, and various bonds gradually rebounded. Consequently, compared to the previous day, bonds such as the 1929 Reorganization and Disbandment, the 1930 Goodwill, and the 1921 Cigarette Tax each rose by over 1.3 yuan. Other bonds also improved by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. The total spot transaction volume for the day was 13,500 yuan, while the total futures transaction volume still reached 10.09 million yuan. Among them, the 1929 Reorganization and Disbandment bond remained the most active, followed by the 1930 Goodwill and the 1921 Cigarette Tax. Other bonds remained as sluggish as before.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market in Decline <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to weaken, and the situation is increasingly heading towards a downward trend. This is mainly due to the declining conditions in overseas cotton yarn markets, the rising silver prices, and the easing exchange rates. As a result, market sentiment is shaken, and the price of third-grade yarn is showing signs of fatigue. The previous rumor that local yarn was being shipped to Japan was reportedly false due to non-compliance with packaging requirements, causing market sentiment to retreat further. However, a certain major manufacturer remains strong, purchasing more as prices fall, accumulating increasingly large positions. Sales of spot yarn are becoming increasingly sluggish. If third-grade American cotton continues to fall, the price of standard yarn may break through the 170 tael mark.</p>
<p>▲ Near-Month Human Standard Decreases by Two Taels</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the Human Standard market, due to the declining American cotton and the sluggish gold market, market sentiment was relatively weak, and sellers were prevalent. Prices fell by 1.25 cents across the board. The afternoon opening was slightly firmer due to large buyers increasing their positions. However, prices fell again in the second and third sessions. As a result, near-month contracts fell by 5.9 cents, while far-month contracts rose by 4.5 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 26,800 bales. Sales included 1,050 bales from He Shen, 1,400 bales from Yu Da, 750 bales from Gong Tai, and 850 bales from Shen Da. Purchases included 1,150 bales from Mei Ji, 1,050 bales from Da Fu, 1,250 bales from Geng Feng, and 1,450 bales from Xin Cheng. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>| Contract Month | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>

<p>▲ Spot Sales Only 860 Bales</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are becoming increasingly quiet. The total purchases by various guilds for the day were only 860 bales. Fellow merchants bought 265 bales, merchants from the mainland bought 525 bales, merchants from Niuzhuang bought 75 bales, merchants from Nanyang bought 140 bales, merchants from Shantou bought 40 bales, merchants from Qinglidao bought 40 bales, and miscellaneous merchants bought 40 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Cotton Market Extremely Weak <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is extremely weak, and the decline is sharp. This is mainly due to the falling gold prices, the lengthening exchange rates, and the declining prices of foreign cotton, leading to declines in both official and unofficial markets. As a result, market sentiment is showing signs of panic. The Japanese trading company, Dongmian, sold off a large number of long positions, causing the market to loosen significantly. Spot cotton trading is becoming increasingly quiet, and the attitude of various factories is indifferent. The future of the cotton market still depends on the gold prices and foreign cotton prices.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Decreases by 1.25 Taels</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the Han Standard market, due to the declining Indian and American cotton prices and the easing silver prices, there was a lack of buyers in the market. Prices fell by 8-9 cents to 1.2 taels across the board. In the afternoon, the Japanese trading company sold off a large number of positions, overwhelming the market, and prices fell by another 3-4 cents across all months. The total transaction volume for the day was 89,100 dan. Sales included 5,800 dan from Gong Tai, 6,200 dan from Shen Chang, 3,800 dan from Geng Feng, 3,000 dan from Xing Yuan, and 1,800 dan from Ji Feng. Purchases included 2,400 dan from Da Fu, 3,500 dan from Tian Jiang, 3,000 dan from Tai Xing, 3,100 dan from Chang Feng, 3,000 dan from Yuan Da, and 2,400 dan from Xin Cheng.

<p>▲ American Cotton Falls by 20 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially sluggish due to a lack of stable buyers. Later, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and reactive selling, the market became even weaker. Futures fell by 16-17 points, while spot fell by 20 points. English cotton futures fell by 8-9 points, while spot fell by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 15 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to unfavorable American cotton news and local short selling. Later, due to continued unfavorable news from Liverpool, brokers dumped shares, causing the market to weaken further. Japanese trading companies purchased shares. The Pingguoer near and far month contracts fell by 4 rupees, the Aomula fell by 3 rupees, the far month contract fell by 4 rupees, and the Bairoxi near and far month contracts fell by 5 rupees.

<h3 id="e185">American Cotton Stable Last Week <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 6th reports on the cotton market during the past week: trading on the cotton exchange was quiet last week, and prices were mixed. Industry insiders are waiting and watching for new developments. The stability of the political situation in India is enough to improve the cotton goods in Lancashire and Japan, and the domestic demand for cotton cloth continues to be active. These are all reasons for the stability of the market. However, India's proposal to increase the import tax on cotton cloth by 5%, and the German cotton mills' plan to reduce work for six weeks starting on March 16, will also have an impact on the aforementioned situation. When prices rebounded, India and Japan made slight purchases. The issue of reducing cotton planting area is approximately 8% to 15%. It is reported that the cooperative has warned the South that if cotton prices are to improve, the cotton planting area must be reduced to a considerable extent so that supply and demand can be equal. The weekend statistics are recorded below (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, over 30 ships arrived from various guilds, and market sales were slightly more active. White japonica rice prices increased by about 1 cent due to cargo owners selling and a few workshops refreshing their stock. The market situation is showing a firm appearance. Thin paddy rice arrivals are scarce, and the price is flat. Bulk prices are increasing by nearly 1 cent, with special grades still opening at the 11 yuan mark. High-quality xiangdao rice is scarce, and purchasing sentiment is not very strong. Market prices are increasing slightly. Du Bu premium rice arrivals are low, and inventory is thin. Production costs are particularly high, so shipments to Shanghai are frequently reduced, and market conditions are rising by nearly 1 foot. Metamorphic Yuan rice arrivals and sales are both weak, and the situation is stabilizing.</p>
<p>▲ Hu Nan: Yesterday, ships from the mainland continued to arrive. The sales market on this street is not good. The white japonica rice market is stable. Transactions of Jiangsu-Zhejiang goods are still acceptable, while Chang-Xi goods have become sluggish. Prices are the same as the previous day. The source of southern early thin paddy rice is also poor, and the sales channel is not very developed, so prices barely maintain the original level. The xiang rice market is generally flat with few transactions, and the market is quiet. The situation for white yuan rice is mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Rice Merchants Actively Purchase Xiang Rice <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's xiang rice market situation was quite good. Although merchants from Shantou did not go to warehouses, rice merchants had a very good appetite and purchased a considerable amount in recent days. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags were sold, and the price immediately rose by 1 to 2 cents. Merchants from Shantou are still inquiring about ke yuan rice, and the market is also firm. This street is also slightly inquiring. The total transaction volume for the day included 325 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed yuan rice, priced at 12.7 yuan to 11.4 yuan, purchased by Shantou merchants. Rice merchants purchased 700 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed late rice, priced at 13 yuan, 12.6 yuan, and 12.3 yuan, respectively. In addition, 200 bags of Hunan machine-processed oil rice were priced at 12.55 yuan, and 100 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed early rice were priced at 12 yuan. 250 bags of Nanjing medium-grade brown rice were priced at 8.7 yuan to 8.4 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Flour Prices Trend Lower from Flat <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed a trend of first stabilizing and then falling for each contract month. The opening prices in the morning were based on quotations for foreign wheat, with little fluctuation. As the weather was not clear, industry insiders and outsiders felt relatively stable. However, in the afternoon, the market atmosphere gradually changed. Spot goods, such as Red and Blue car-branded flour from Naval Transport, can be purchased with a standard increase of 6 cents. As larger factories still have a surplus of foreign wheat, they continue to sell off. The weather also improved and became clear, so prices for each contract month gradually declined. Private sources say that Chicago spot wheat has also been heavily marketed recently, with prices quoted at 19.5 yuan. Factories quote over 18.5 yuan. In addition, Russian wheat is also being marketed, with over 40 varieties of wheat. Judging from this situation, it seems that everything is unfavorable for long positions, so the changes in the future are endless. As a result, the current month contract fell by 1 cent compared to the previous day, the April-May contract fell by 1 cent, the June-July contract fell by 1.5 cents, and the August contract fell by 1.25 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Wheat Futures Market Unanimously Weak <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed a downward trend for each contract month. Although the quotations for foreign wheat did not change much, they depended on demand. Factories such as Fuxin and Fufeng have large stockpiles of foreign wheat that are not only sufficient but may even be surplus. The exchange's standards will naturally no longer be purchased. In terms of the environment, it is difficult to stabilize again. Furthermore, the external atmosphere is gradually becoming unfavorable. The marketing of foreign wheat continues unabated, so market sentiment is shaken and prices are gradually softening. As a result, the current month contract fell by 6 cents compared to the previous day, the April contract fell by 4 cents, the May contract fell by 3 cents, the June-July contract fell by 4 cents, and the August contract fell by 3 cents. The spot wheat market is slightly sluggish. 500 bags of Kaidaoren Bridge wheat were priced at 12.623 taels, purchased by Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Sugar Market: Raw Sand and White Sugar Slightly Stabilize After Falling <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reported that the price of Cuban spot sugar continued to fall by 0.3125 yuan compared to the previous telegram. Only the December contract in New York sugar futures rose by 1 cent, and the remaining months did not fluctuate. The price of Java spot and futures sugar also lacked rising or falling. The association's market delineation, the Dutch sugar No. 24 raw sand and white sugar, due to the lengthening of the exchange rate, prices slumped even further. The initial transaction price was 10.085 taels, with very few buyers and many sellers. Later, the price fell to 10.075 taels, and buyers gradually became more active, with over 1,000 bags traded. Sellers tightened, and the market gradually became firmer. However, it had already fallen sharply by 1.5 cents compared to the previous day. Medium-grade white sugar was quoted at 10.03 taels, with no inquiries. The Japanese sugar market also trended weaker, with even fewer transactions. N-mark was priced at 10.0775 taels, TK mark at 10.075 taels, YT mark at 10.07 taels, YP mark at 10.0975 to 0.095 taels, and YRO mark at 10.045 to 0.04 taels. The market conditions were weak across the board. The board had a consolidated hand of ice, opening dozens of boxes, priced at 8 taels per yuan, and the market was flat and unremarkable.</p>

<p>1,300 pieces of foreign paper arrived from Germany.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Era Youth Society Holds Essay Contest <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Regarding the Era Youth Society, its current position in the youth community has its own general value and weight, which I need not elaborate on here. This can be seen in the "Era Youth" weekly publication. Now, in order to encourage youth academic research and publication abilities, they are holding their first essay contest, titled "Several Important Issues for Era Youth" and "Literature and Art and Politics." The former discusses issues related to youth themselves, while the latter is a review of the current stage of the literary and artistic movement. The society has also prepared cash prizes, with the first prize being 30 yuan, the second prize being 20 yuan, the third prize being 10 yuan, and the fourth to tenth prizes being books, stationery, and other souvenirs. In addition to welcoming submissions from members, non-members are also welcome to participate. It is said that many excellent works have already been received, but for the sake of general consideration, the deadline has not yet been set. The mailing address is c/o West Gate Daguang Bookstore.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Era Youth <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>27th Special Large Issue</p>
<p>Daguang Bookstore General Distributor</p>
<p>The youth's field requires the youth's own labor force to engage in the work of reclamation. We can see the entire state revealed by the youth community from the expression of this inner genuine emotion, and at the same time, we can find clues as to why the youth have such requirements in a certain consciousness and occasion. Of course, in recent years, the division of the youth community, the path of decline of the majority of youth, and the creation of a terrifying situation are due to the inability of youth to have mutual trust and shared belief. But is it not also the shackles of the environment that sweep the youth into the whirlpool of hesitation? The youth wandering at the crossroads is indeed a sign of the youth's weak will. However, when it comes to the final analysis, it is often related to the social system. We should also admit it. Therefore, there are inevitably enlightened youth who see through this phenomenon and rise up to defend the entire youth community, on the one hand, pointing out the sins of the status quo, and on the other hand, deeply reflecting on themselves, hoping for general awakening. Thus, the so-called silent zero encirclement is broken through, and we can see its promising path from the sum of the pioneering forces.</p>
<p>We can certainly say that "Era Youth" is the product of this situation because their reasons for launching and development coincide with what was said above. They recognized the meaning of the promotion given to youth by the cycle of the era, stood at the measure of the era to pursue a fulfilling life, were liberated from the cage of disease, and raised their heads towards the realm of light.</p>
<p>In summary, "Era Youth" has been published for almost half a year now. Although we cannot say that it has generated any strength, the fact that they have made unremitting efforts is a very good sign for the youth community, which deserves praise. Now, starting from the 27th issue, the scope has been expanded again, "because we feel that the scope is too small to accommodate as many submissions as possible, so we decided to expand the original scope. Generally, we will still inherit the previous practice, only in the compilation aspect, the editors will do their best to gradually reform." From this, the expansion plan of "Era Youth" has been realized, so we will inevitably be able to see further performance, and win glory for the youth themselves.</p>
<p>Truly, "at whatever new stage, there must be the revealing of the expectation of a new expression, as a tendency to be respected and followed," so we read such a passage in Li Dachun's "New Opening":</p>
<p>... Of course, we always admit that a weak force may only be equal to a trembling groan, but precisely because the environment in which the youth are in is such a tragic situation, especially during this period of rapid change in the great era, the shadows of the decadent twilight obscure the active atmosphere of the entire youth community. On the one hand, due to the historical objective facts, we are even more inevitably unable to settle down, and then we will strive to express the spirit of our era youth, so that our hearts can grasp the comfort of the right track. As a result, we finally lifted our heads from the confinement of the low-spirited atmosphere and moved forward on the path of struggle. Therefore, the main purpose in the future is still to be summed up in this direction. Our explorations are not limited to the narrow definition. All issues that directly or indirectly affect the youth themselves, we need to review for reasonable requirements. In the theory and practice of the youth movement, we will not relax in opening up a bright path, breaking through the crisis of silence and decline. In addition, regarding other things, we have also talked about in the "Publication Preface." In short, for the crystallization of loyalty and enthusiasm, we should earnestly accept and give the opportunity to publish.</p>
<p>... The youth of the era should urgently take on a task. Our pursuit of the project is to think about the way out for the entire youth community. Then, if we do not forget the position we are in at present, the era we are in, we should not hesitate to press the responsibility of nurturing actions on our own shoulders.</p>
<p>Indeed, the past "Era Youth" has had many explorations in the theory and practice of the youth movement. Recently, Hao Wu's "Era Youth and National Movement" has fully elaborated the institutions maintained by the Era Youth and the national movement. Secondly, Li Chunsen's "The Beginning of the 20th Year and the Prospect of the Chinese Youth Movement" more clearly marked the program of action. These are probably well known to readers. In this issue, there is another text worth paying attention to, which is Zhu Jianbai's "Youth and Politics." This issue seems to be broad, but the author's sectional explanation makes us clearly understand the relationship between youth and politics. This is also often the case in texts discussing the youth movement. The efforts of the youth movement are actually actions that directly participate in politics. Whether today's youth movement should directly participate in political actions is an issue worthy of detailed review. The author first solves the two major premises of what is youth and what is politics. Under the titles of politics and youth, he explains the education of politics and youth, the way out of politics and youth, and the activities of politics and youth. Under the titles of youth and politics, he explains the current situation of youth and politics, the revolution of youth and politics, the ideology of youth and politics, and the activities of youth and politics. As for the author's conclusion, he said, "Finally, we must know that youth and politics have an inseparable relationship. If youth do not care about politics, politics will interfere with everything about youth. The current political situation is even more awaiting the improvement of youth. Therefore, the youth should strive for political activities, in principle, there is nothing wrong with it. However, if the youth misinterpret the political ideology, they will go the wrong way in political activities. This must be paid attention to, especially during the period of political tutelage, when the work of destruction has passed and the responsibility of construction is being shouldered. In practice, the direct political activities of students in school have to be restricted. This is precisely to give students in school the opportunity for full preparation, which is a positive intention, not a negative measure..." This is a powerful insight, which we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also Jing Qi's "The Place of Modern Women under Capitalism and Their Due Self-Awareness," Yi Tie Jun's "The Prospect of Recovering the Shanghai Concession and Revolutionary Diplomacy," Yi Chun's "Relief of the Crisis of Dropping Out of School in the Period of Change," Mo Zhi's "Youth and Reading Clubs," Luo Xiang's "Reflections," Qi Yun's "In the Examination Field," and Yi Wencao's novel "Dumb Old Man," all of which are written with the youth's loyal thoughts. "School Radio" reports the news of various schools. After reading it, we will have an indescribable taste. Such compilation will increase the driving force of the youth of the era.</p>
