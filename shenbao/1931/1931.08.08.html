<p>珠江流域僅廣東一省。廣東位居南海之濱。地勢最低。珠江縱横西南。東西北三江分道浸灌。而匯集於廣州。每屆春夏。必有潦水漲發。災情之輕重。則視雨水之多少而定。此次霪雨連綿。東西北三江同時暴漲。冲毁圍基。蕩平田廬。淹斃人畜。受災至重。較之過去乙卯年大水。甚且過之。</p>
<p>北江沿廣韶路至源潭站附近鄉村。全没水中。不見屋脊。稻田中水深二丈餘。彌望一片汪洋。清遠水深逾三十尺。難民散處山岡。仰天待死。屋宇禾田菓木。一時槪歸烏有。廣韶鐵路路基崩决三千餘尺。損失亦在四十萬元以上。總計北江災區。共有清遠·源潭·曲江·英德·翁源·始興·南雄·浛洸·等縣。以英德清遠源潭一隅言。災民已達三十萬餘人。淹斃與餓死者四五千人。源潭難民百餘。棲宿破窰。窰壁忽崩塌。百餘人叢葬其中。無一倖免。</p>
<p>東江各地。以韓江之水順流冲下。江水陡漲。潮梅惠州各屬。都成澤國。難民露宿山巓。坐看田禾屋宇。隨波逐浪以俱去。號泣呼天。哀聲震野。</p>
<p>西江流域。以三水受災最慘。共崩潰一百二十六圍。全縣槪被淹没。深處二丈。淺處亦五六尺。災民逃居山巓者十餘萬人。無處安生。次爲四會。該縣三婆井·大洲·塘·龍頭崗·東圍竇口·等地方。圍都决口。田禾屋宇。槪没於洪流中。</p>
<p>此珠江流域之災况也。至於福建。以閩江上游延平一帶。洪水直瀉而下。省城正當其衝。城内全部入水。省府水深及膝。而附近鄉村。如洪水橋西鄉一帶。水竟有深至二三丈者。田禾苜莉珠蘭子規菜蔬。皆已絶望。而屋宇畜羣。則更隨波逐流。漂散水上。淹斃人口。爲數亦多。</p>
<p>此外如關外之中東路沿線。亦都被水。但報載不詳。總計全國被災區域。共有十六省區。幾及我國土地三分之二。被災人口。共達五千萬餘以上。而淹斃者尙未列入。如此鉅災。如此慘象。雖非僅見。應亦罕有。國人再不本人類高尙之互助精神。急起拯救。更待何時。</p>

<p>紐約有幾家餐館。對於公司菜一項。除了菜單上所開列的以外。向來不肯通融增添。近來爲招徠主顧起見。却變通辦法。每一客公司菜中倘有可口的東西可向館中添素。儘你放量的吃。不另取資。自從這辦法施行以後營業上大爲發達可是主顧們吃了一碟再要一碟的。只有百分之五。所以並没有甚麽損失。</p>
<p>人工呼吸的機械</p>
<p>凡是溺水或中煤毒的人。往往有窒息之苦。必須趕快用人工呼吸法。或可救治。以前人工呼吸並無機械。現在英國却有了機械了使患者躺在一隻緊密而不透氣的大槽中。只有頭部露出在外。空氣在規定的短時間内一出一入。就使他漸漸地恢復了呼吸。</p>

<p>司馬長卿有言。千金之子。坐不垂堂。誠以其身可愛。不敢輕蹈危機。或遭不測也。奈何吾友葉子平仲。以烏衣貴胄。竟忘斯戒。偶作夫差水嬉。頓隨屈子長游。致遺憾千古耶。平仲君名旦。姑蘇臺畔之周莊人。蘇省政府主席葉楚傖氏之次公子也。年十七。肄業申江南洋中學有年。爲人和藹可親。不染時下習。居恒好學不倦。於校中之事。能悉力效勞。且大公無私。故同學中咸器重之。曾累任級會大會主席。一任德育部部長。成績卓然。凡級中對外之事。人不敢爲者。葉子每奮勇直前、未嘗稍却。對於課務。好學深思。輒冠其曹。去冬大考。因物理考分稍遜今春更努力。卒致名列前茅。非特同學爲之色喜。即師長亦無不交口譽之。課暇則研究各種主義學說。每有心得。則握管作文。洋洋千言。廢寢忘食。尤好詩詞。校中壁報。時見其作品。數日前。曾寄我七絶四首。閱啼笑因緣說部後所作也。性肫摯。敦於友誼。譚藝講學。虚衷結納。有商邱公子風。今也忽以游泳遭滅頂聞矣。噩耗傳來。能不黯然。葉子本不善泅泳。其第一次即在今夏大考前之星期日。偕同學在虹口游泳池練習。不意其返鎭後。竟在運河内入水。不思子産水懦弱。狎翫致死之語。遂致不起。馮夷肆虐。殲我良友。呈。命已夫。回溯去臘。余偕吳子朝宗二弟逸飛。作京口之游。到鎭後。即往訪葉子。渥承招待。同攬金焦北固諸勝。時雖北風凛烈。滕六玉戲纔罷。而葉子殷殷導游。毫無難色。游凡二日。未嘗稍離也。他日重來。風景不殊。而人琴已邈。能母腸斷乎。記暑假臨别時。葉子尙詢以重詣京口之期。余告以此假期中。定當赴鎭。作平原十日游。豈知言猶在耳。波臣竟奪我故人去耶。前情如昨。棖觸懷來。因作憶故人二闋。聊以志痛。「怨吐冰徽。芸窗誼重塵緣淺。陽關纔唱又虞歌。乍聽言疑諓。從此燈鷄誰伴。憶朋簪。迴腸寸斷。浪淘難盡。天問無言。斜陽西轉。」「嬉狎澂波。汨羅竟逐靈均去。鍾期已邈少知音。凄絶人琴語。兩點金焦如故。忍重提。聽潮衝霧。愴懐勝侣。極目京江。招魂何處。」（却酬）</p>

<p>馬路之名。殊不可考。就其文義言之。則馬路者實馬行之路也。而肩摩踵接。熙攘往來者。固人耶馬耶。顧名思義。不禁有啞然失笑者。昔者周道如砥。其直如矢。今之馬路。如砥如矢。彷彿周道矣。而不曰大路。而曰馬路。雖士大夫亦習焉呼之而弗察。是亦可怪焉。或曰馬路者。以其道路之平坦廣闊。足以容怒馬之奔馳。馬路之名。意在斯乎。</p>
<p>傭墨餘閑。嘗躑躅於馬路。輒見馬路當局。高揭觸目驚心之標語。曰「馬路如虎口。行人不可走。」吾乃私維。旣曰馬路。其不可走人宜也。而又譬之爲虎口。吾又惑焉。昔人安步以當車。其所步之路。初不若今之馬路之爲平坦廣闊也。而今人生们物質文明之世。乃不得安步於平坦廣闊之馬路間。其抱憾又何如耶。豈眞有虎狼當道。令人興「行路難」之嘆乎。雖然。世道崎嶇。荆棘遍地亦何往而非虎口也。噫……</p>

<p>曩年余負笈北平。暑假期中。曾偕友多人。一探八達嶺之勝。是處地接長城。登臨之際。但見塞外風號。塵烟浩蕩。胸襟爲之一振。地多産石。率作草木雲烟之狀。同儕偶得若干。均視爲異。余於城畔沙磧。覓獲一枚。方可半尺。細辨之。上有松枝。其旁細草數莖。恍如刻畫。歸置案頭。未足奇也。迨携之南來。遇友程君出以相示。程君謂係長城基石之片段。昔遊口北。頗知其名。蓋石歷年久。與草木同化。能預兆陰晴。厥推特點。偶遇風雨欲來。石含枝葉。每顯濕潤之色。而晴明則反是。留心試騐。覺相吻合。因知石亦可珍。足爲晴雨計矣。</p>
<p>近來有友蓋君。自大汶口來。贈余二石。作方碍狀。余方訝其見餽之奇。蓋君即言。此石産自汶口。爲他處所鮮見。因南方之燕。飛渡汶河。所孵幼雛。每墮水底。經年累月。與泥士相合。遂成若干燕化之石。當地人民。開掘河身兩岸。率有發見·歷年外省人來此搜羅。得其清雅者。鑿成方圓。飾以框架。視爲點綴。書齋畫堂之佳品。不過歷歷如畫圖者。近年已屬寡有矣。斯二石也。各有水藻浮萍之跡。其間雜以小燕。翺翔飛舞。態多不同。天然造就。而成如此之奇。固不禁嘆造物之巧矣。我國地大物博。石之異實不祇此。偶記所藏。蓋亦藉見一斑耳。</p>

<p>— 袁容舫</p>
<p>白香山詩云。未忍抛得杭州去。一半勾留爲此湖。余寄跡武林。春秋十易。顧以線務束縛。未暇飽領湖山之勝。以眎白傅之朝夕流連。詩酒嘯傲。固未容同日語也。去夏痛膺臯魚。覺湖光山色。充滿慘傷。凄然似不可復留。今春薄游春申。軟紅十丈。車水馬龍。玉笙珠蟆。極南朝金粉之繁華。然際茲驕陽咄咄。長日神倦。思得一清凉地。作半日游。藉怡心神。竟不可獲。回溯六橋三竺之勝。益不勝李學士天姥之縈。</p>
<p>杭人士每值盛暑。恒以山居爲樂。大率借榻僧寮。一時湖上巨刹。如靈隠天竺凈慈玉泉鳳林等。無不客滿。其餘較小蘭若。亦多莘莘學子。蓋山中氣候旣凉。琳宫清潔。素肴精美。花木禪房。宜於消暑者也。</p>
<p>余夏日每寅卯時興。盥洗後。於落月殘星間。出候潮門。越萬松嶺。至湖上。山中曉氣清風。併作新凉。松柳上宿露瀼瀼。霑衣袖間姙珍珠狀。踈鐘斷續。如相應答。或至靜慈觀僧衆早課。古佛靑燈。紅魚貝叶。悠然世外。或至蘇堤看曉色。徜徉六橋等。晴則霞光萬道。射碧波上。炫耀金碧。陰則烟霧一湖。雲山隠現。不數米家　幅。奇景幻出。瞬息萬變。佇立凝視。目眩神迷。縱摩詰復生。恐亦窮於摹繪。興盡。或由蘇堤沿柳陰達旗營。或買小舟入清波門。歸。常在辰巳之間。</p>
<p>畢竟西湖六月中。風光不與四時同。接天蓮葉無窮碧。映日荷花别樣紅。此宋人詩也。可知宋時西湖夏日之價值。今者時異勢殊。湖上芙葉。非復昔日之盛。余初至杭時。後湖孤山一帶。尙多栽植。每值公暇。輒於晨光熹微中。刺小艇。進錦帶橋。　棹花叢。舟雖不繫無吹去之慮。錦光一片。清芳滿湖。余時誦誠齋清曉之吟。當越女採蓮之曲。不覺神之悠然也。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>陸先生也不便再推託了，雖然他覺得到蘇州去是不大妥當，但是他還以爲事情不見得會太巧，到蘇州去也未必一定會給他家裏的人瞧見；何况這是一個最好的機會，他對於丁小姐，正可以因此而有更進一步的要求了。所以他也不再反對，却反希望着能夠早一些去哩。</p>
<p>「那麽，我們那一天去？」他問。</p>
<p>「明天就去，可以玩兩天，」小姐說。</p>
<p>又談了一回，丁小姐要回家去了，陸先生便一直送伊到了家裏。當時又約定了明天趁下午五點○五分的快車動身，在伊家裏一同出發。</p>
<p>戀戀不捨地别去，陸先生也不高興回到校裏去住了，就住在一家旅館中過了一夜。</p>
<p>丁小姐回到了家裏，伊的母親還没有睡覺，原來秋子已經把方才所窺見的一切告訴了伊，把陸先生說得像童話中的美麗的小仙人，把方才會客室裏的情形形容得像金童玉女的故事。丁太太聽了很高興，，所以伊要等着伊女兒回來了細細地問問。</p>
<p>「你那裏去的？跟着誰同去的？」丁太太對着伊女兒，也露出了神秘的笑容。</p>
<p>「媽！我正也要告訴你！媽！你看這個戒指是我的一個同學送給我的。」伊吞吐地羞澀地說，</p>
<p>「現在的世界，我們這種老年人眞是什麽都不會明白的了，不像我們小時候，像這種事至少就得麻煩上一兩個月，相親哩，排八字哩，送盤哩，那有現在那樣的容易啊。」丁太太對着伊女兒手上的鑽戒諦視着一邊說，一邊微微地笑。　　丁小姐十分的羞澀，那實在没有其他的說話好講，祗默默地低着頭拈弄着自己的衣帶。</p>
<p>丁太太又接下去說：「那麽，那個陸先生是怎麽一個人呢？」</p>
<p>丁小姐一聲也不響、伊覺得這是很難回答的。秋子站在一旁，却笑着說道：　　「太太！那個陸先生和小姐，眞是天造地設的一對」</p>
<p>「他家裏做什麽事情的呢？」丁太太接着又問。</p>
<p>「他的爸是蘇州的鄉紳，家裏田地房産也有得不少·」丁小姐輕輕地回答。</p>
<p>「好！本來這是你自己的事，你自己合意了，就是了，我也祗有你這樣一個女兒，什麽都由你自己作主吧！」丁太太慈祥地笑了。</p>
<p>時候已經很晚，丁太太自去睡了。丁小姐假意怪着秋子多嘴，心裏却反而得到了不少的安慰。</p>
<p>一夜在甜美的夢中過去，伊覺得這遺留在心頭的滋味，是從來没有嘗過的，直到醒回來時，還彷彿有纏綿的熱情永遠在搖撼着伊的靈魂。</p>
<p>伊起身了，吩咐秋子把幾件衣服和一些盥洗的用具裝在一個小小的手提箱裏。自己却到母親那裏，告訴伊要到蘇州去玩兩天。</p>
<p>伊的母親是疼愛着伊的，自然什麽都由伊自己作主。祗叮囑着伊：「路上要小心，兩天之後回來！」</p>
<p>從上午九點鐘到下午四點鐘，在丁小姐的心中，好像覺得時間過分地過得慢了。好容易等到陸先生到來，才一同到車站去。兩個人各自有着他們自己的愉快。</p>

<p>紗市跌風稍戢、因大跌之後、暫可立定、然海外情形、依然不振、而實銷滯鈍、各路均無發展氣象、故大戶態度鎭靜、毫無抵補之念、但有一部份獲利者扒空、午後因金市有看高消息、市氣較爲堅挺、然環象仍在不良中、蓋各地水災嚴重、打擊不淺、目前或有一度小盤旋亦未可知也</p>
<p>人標散戶扒空　交易所人標前市開盤、以美棉仍疲、場中市氣仍軟、惟獲利者扒空、各月微漲三四錢、二三盤驟跌、結果近漲一二錢、遠跌一錢、午後開盤仍衰、二三盤以原棉上漲、致散戶扒空、各月均漲一三八錢、成交計四萬四千二百包、查賣出公泰一千一百包、泰昌九百包、新華一千九百包、信誠七百五十包、榮興七百包、買進恒德一千九百包、愼記七百包、益昶六百五十包、興元一千六百五十包、榮興六百包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<p>棉市跌勢略定、因連日跌風太烈、引起獲利者扒空、市氣稍形帶堅、然美棉狀况依然衰弱、現貨八分關口、業已跌破、惟本埠人心因天氣悶熱、深恐釀成風潮、午後金價微見上升、多數有看漲之說、如金市一高、外棉進口價高、於是散戶扒補、市况轉漲然美棉於根本上仍在悲觀中</p>
<p>漢標隨金市回漲　交易所漢標前市開盤、以美棉微跌數磅音、致人心平平、賣戶缺乏、各月漲二·三錢、二三盤又跌、結果漲五分至一錢半、午後標花以金價上漲之故、市况略昂、漲一錢半至二錢、成交計九萬一千担、查賣出明華二千五百担、賡豐二千五百担、新華四千四百担、德記二千四百担、晋豐二千八百担長豐一千三百担、買進源豐三千四百担、興元二千七百担、明德二千担、泰興三千三百担、同餘二千一百担、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<p>定本月十五日起</p>

<p>通揚班輪　大達公司通揚班、往來行駛各輪、最近每日由大龢·大慶·大德·三輪不斷航行、自滬至揚、由揚回滬、各輪來去須經七十餘小時、自大吉輪肇禍後、即由例定載貨之漢平輪補充、載客裝貨、自上月初旬漢平輪調往南京後、故通揚班僅三輪來往開行、</p>
<p>大吉改建　自大吉輪由該公司委托瑞鎔造船廠承造、於茲三月、所有全部船身艙間、一律以鐵版砌造、房間計五十餘間、總噸計一千四百餘、載貨凈噸、能負九百餘、載客可容八九百人、船長二百十六尺、寬度三十六尺、業已造成、前昨兩日、在淞口實行更車、成績殊佳、速率每小時可達十二碼、即三海哩又三、聞該輪改建造價、近二十萬元、輪名已改稱大豫、</p>
<p>大豫航期　近月以來、通揚班往來僅三輪互航、該公司决定本月十五日夜起、將大豫新輪加入航行、正式配入班次、</p>
<p>碼頭問題　滬南區一號至十六號碼頭、每三年須修建一次、本年已至修建期間、由市工務局方面雇工修建、大達停輪碼頭、係在滬南區四五號碼頭間、故近來大達各輪、因碼頭問題、每夜裝貨乘客登輪、槪由划船渡至輪標（浮筒）附近過輪、近頃四五碼頭約在三四日即可建成、故十五日大豫輪開航載客、可由碼頭登輪云、</p>

<p>「這是最時式的、請試試吧、」一個頭髮精光的中年店夥、拿着一雙雪靑夾白的高底籐鞋恭恭敬敬地遞給她、</p>
<p>「這式樣、我很喜歡哩——祇是太長了點、）她微偏的曲俯着、把穿着新鞋的脚踏在絨毯上反覆地端詳、忽然肩膀上有隻軟棉棉的手掌拍了一下、驚得她急忙地轉過頭來、</p>
<p>「晤、碧漣、我道是誰哩——你幾時來的呀、」她用一種眞誠歡喜的微帶驚異的眼光注視着伊、</p>
<p>「呵、眞好、我們會得在這里碰見、」碧漣緊緊地握着她的手說、「鞋子哩、買好了嗎、我們外邊去談談吧、</p>
<p>「好了、就是這一雙吧、」</p>
<p>她拾着鞋盒和碧漣走出百貨公司、沿着水門汀轉過去、走進一家廣東點心店、這時才上午十點鐘左右、各桌位上祗疏疏落落地坐了幾個人、她們隨意呌了幾色點心、一邊談着、碧漣告訴了她許多的話、又說道、「你知道嗎、蒲生表叔死了、」</p>
<p>「呵、他死了……怎麽就會死呢、」她眼前似乎有一個冷酷白瘦的面孔在浮動着、</p>
<p>「聽說是吐血、」</p>
<p>「呵、吐血……」鮮紅的血影、疾迅地從她眼前閃過、</p>
<p>一個嚴冷的冬天、雪片紛亂地在空中飛舞、朔風像瘋狂般地打着玻璃窗拍拍地作響、從窗隙裏鑽進來的尖風、夾着雪屑撲到病人的臉上、他立刻起了一陣顫慄、他的臉往破大衣的領裏面縮了一縮、伸出一隻没有血色的手、顫抖抖地把裏在腿上的舊絨毯用力的掖了一下、這輕微的震動、馬上使他咯咯地咳嗽起來、</p>
<p>「文舅、你是在冷吧、」她憂鬱地看着病人說、</p>
<p>文舅點了點頭、咳得越是厲害了、</p>
<p>她輕輕地把窗簾遮好、房裏頓時籠罩在灰色的陰影裏、呈現着一種凄慘陰森的情詞、</p>
<p>她慢慢地走回原坐的位子坐卞、沉悶地望着病人瘦削的臉、失神的眼睛、不斷地嗆咳着、抽動着………、她不由地心靈悸跳起來、似乎這陰沉的環境、立刻會有非常的恐怖降臨、又好像有血紅的長舌、披散着的長髮、巨掌、來來往往地在面前飛躍閃動、她恐懼得不敢再望病人、「怎的、舅母還不來啊、」她時時地喃喃念着、</p>
<p>一陣急劇的嗆咳過後、文舅的臉越覺靑慘得可怕、他發出低弱的聲音說道、「宜甥、看啊、似乎有血哩、」她急忙站起來往痰盂裏一望、驚得她幾乎呌起來、那麽鮮、那麽紅、像剛從鷄頸脖裏滴出來的一樣、注滿了一痰盂、發出一股難聞的血腥氣、</p>
<p>「呵、眞的有血啊、磨點墨汁喝吧、」她竭力壓住自己的驚悸鎭靜地說、</p>
<p>文舅搖搖頭、從他枯澀的眼光裏現露着一種可怕的生命的失望的痛苦、他微微地嘆了一口氣、面孔轉向裏邊、</p>
<p>蓬亂的頭髮、頷下幾根黃淡的鬍鬚、張開的嘴、……幽暗、寂靜、她又墮到驚怖的境界裏了、</p>
<p>「天呵、舅母來了」她聽見開門的響聲、當她跑到狹窄墨暗的弄子、遇着一個黑魆魆的瘦小的人影、他帶着寬邊的呢帽、下頦深深地藏在大衣的皮領裏、帽簷低壓得遮住了臉的上半部、她仔細一看、才認識出是蒲生表叔、</p>
<p>「文舅哩、這冷的天、不會出去吧、」他問着一邊取下來呢帽用手帕拂去上面的雪片、</p>
<p>「在家哩、—但是、病很厲害啊、」她說着呆呆地望着蒲生表叔、想在他冷峻的眼光裏找出一點憐憫、</p>
<p>「哼、病、……」他從鼻管裏發出一種笑间墌嘴角微微地往上翹了一翹、他不再問什麽、很快的向房裏走進去、</p>
<p>「文弟、怎樣了、你該記得吧、前天約好的事、」蒲生表叔把小眼睛睜了一睜、坐到靠門的椅子上說、</p>
<p>「啊、蒲哥、你看、這兩天病厲害哩、」文舅蹙着眉尖掙扎着坐起來說、「我眞不好說哩、怎麽的對不起呵、」</p>
<p>「對不起…這話我聽厭煩了呢、」他搖搖頭從衣袋裏掏出紙烟來一面吸着說、他嘴角裏透出一股白烟、裊裊地散佈着、一下、房子裏烟霧瀰漫、文舅給濃烈的烟氣刺激、又不斷地咳嗆起來、</p>
<p>「唉、蒲哥、我很懂得你對我的仁慈、—但是、窮、病、有什麽辦法呢、」文舅喘着說、</p>
<p>「誰又不窮哩—你總得想法子呀、」他睜了睜眼睛翹着腿輕鬆的抖動着、</p>
<p>「是的、待我病好點、找一件事做、一準先還你的債務、」文舅說着臉上現出可怕的苦笑、他似首知道、這希望於他、只是一種渺茫的不可捉摸的幻影、</p>
<p>「病好嗎、自然是這麽希望、但、」他吐了一口烟說、「你自己應該明白、病是到了怎樣的地步—我又怎能儘你拖欠、你懂得這意思嗎、」他帶着不耐的神色說</p>
<p>「天喲、我是怎麽地在懺悔啊、」文舅雙手按着胸膛、長長地嘘了一口氣、從陷落的眼角邊滾下兩滴苦淚來、接着格格地咳嗽了幾句、一塊痰儘是在喉管裏上下着吐不出、</p>
<p>「癆病、癆病……希望什麽呢、」他喃喃地站起來、搖着頭不住地在房裏來來往往的走着、又似在計算一件什麽事情、</p>
<p>這時完全沉浸在靜默的雰圍中、她被一種悲傷、憤懣、不可抑制的衝動激蕩着、她帶着嫌惡的仇恨的敵意凝視着蒲生表叔的臉、但他似乎全没有注意到、</p>
<p>「怎麽、說啊、衣服也可以抵值的、」他突然地說、眼睛向四圍閃閃地轉動著、</p>
<p>「衣服嗎、什麽都没有了—祇剩下這個、」文舅抖戰著從眠椅裏站起來、身軀不住地往左右搖幌、在眠椅裏抽出墊著的一件破爛的皮袍來、再又重復坐下說、「祇有這個了、你要、就拿去吧、」</p>
<p>「這值得什麽、一月的利息還少著多哩、」蒲生表叔把衣服擎在手裏略略地摺疊了夾在腋下、又向四周望了望說、「還有哩、怎麽辦、」</p>
<p>「半月以後吧、」文舅嘆息地說、</p>
<p>「這麽久、我不能等待、」</p>
<p>「十天吧、」</p>
<p>「也不能、」</p>
<p>「唉、總要讓我好設法啊、」文舅央求著他、</p>
<p>「三天、再遲可就不行拉、」他說著惡意的睨了文舅一眼、不待回答便走了、</p>
<p>文舅覷他走後、只是睜著眼睛注視著屋頂嘆氣、「癆病……癆病、」他反覆地低述著、他的神色是變得怎麽地可怕、他似乎已經看見死神站在他的面前、痛苦、絶望、死的驚惶和生的留戀、瞬息的在他散淡的眼光裏浮閃著、（她簡直恐怖得要哭出來、即是她才十二歲、）</p>
<p>第三天的早上、蒲生表叔又來文舅家裏逼索、并且說了許多不好聽的話郎時文舅已經不能說話了、痰在喉間咯咯地的發響、眼光直瞪、不久、便帶了人間給他的最後的輕侮與厭惡、嚈了他僅有的一絲氣息、</p>
<p>這悽慘殘酷的影象永永地在她記憶裏劃下一道深痕、尤其是蒲生表叔的那副冷酷白瘦的面孔、</p>
<p>「呵、他死了、他吐血死了、」她不禁重複地說著、</p>

<h3 id="c208">讀「國門之戰」後 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 王鐵華</p>
<p>要提起萬國安君的「國門之戰」、不能不連帶映起黃震遐君的「隴海線上」來、的確、「前鋒月刋」接連刋着這樣兩大偉著、使我讀了要感到文學的力量、眞使人感動得要下淚、舉筆寫這些讀感時、滿腔熱情不自主地擁了上來、偉大哉、「國門之戰」、</p>
<p>誰說中國的軍隊不堪和敵人作戰、誰說國恥史上没有光榮的戰蹟、在没有讀「國門之戰」的正文前、請先看黃震遐的序裏的幾句話—</p>
<p>中俄滿州重之役——除同江密山的東線不計外、單就滿州里扎蘭諾爾的戰况而言、華軍前後用兵凡一萬五千、砲四門、飛機兩架、蘇聨帝國主義者前後用兵凡五萬左右、砲二百門、飛機三十架、唐克車三十輛、結果雖以衆寡不敵而敗、但已加敵軍以重創、」</p>
<p>這樣形勢懸殊的戰局、勝敗固已不言可喩、但忠勇的戰士們、畢竟盡了他們最後的一息殺聲、在國門邊永葬着光明的肉血、只此、「别了……親愛的國門……你的孩子無力了、再會呢、」幾句話的俄傾、是怎樣悲壯慘烈的一回事呢、萬國安君以一個連長的地位、歷盡了艱險苦鬥、帶着一身腥血、滿肚憤慨、從壕溝裏跳出來、執筆寫成這六萬字的偉著、自然更加十分的、熱烈親切、我可武斷的說一句、誰讀了不爲感動呢、</p>
<p>戰爭小說、在中國也有過幾篇、寫得像「隴海線上」和國門之戰」的偉大的實在前未見之、「隴海綫上」和「國門之戰」、前者是身經的革命的戰蹟、後者是親歷的民族奮鬥史的一役、因了事實的相殊、所以讀了「隴海綫上」之後、再讀「國門之戰」、更覺得偉大而可歌可泣、在貧弱的中國、還有這國門一役、在貧弱的中國文壇、還有此「國門之戰」、都是了不得的驚人之舉、這恐怕不單是我個人的狂跳狂呌吧、</p>
<p>在本篇的開頭、先寫滿州里、把滿州里的形勢、狀况很清晣地描寫出來、從極平常的許多軍官的新年團聚、在綠酒燈紅的宴曾中、引出赤色恐佈的開始、和蘇聨赤帝國主義者的不惜破壞和平、肆其茶毒的鐵證來、全部戰雲、一陣陣子緊迫上來、至無可奈何時只得舉槍自衛的作戰、以至於力盡背進、全部寫來、充滿了緊張的戰情、熱烈的火燄、使人讀了、有恨不得也像作者一樣、咆哮跳舞、衝向敵陣中去、</p>
<p>在團晏中、由團長的戲言、說萬連長的夫人流波是赤俄、于是慌了這位萬連長、他寫着、</p>
<p>「我正在咀嚼我這偎紅依翠的滋味、忽聽團長這樣的問我、使我呆了半天、不知怎樣回答好、大家以爲我酒吃多了的緣故、流波（他的俄國夫人）也看出團長呌我、她用手不住的推我、我祗得站起來很慌張的說、</p>
<p>「報告團長、流波的家庭是很小康、她父母因爲受不了赤俄的脅迫、所以暫時欺騙地入黨、我調查得很明告、團長終能相信吧、」</p>
<p>但是戰機一發、滿洲里潛伏着不少間諜、來施行破壞暗殺和刺探軍情的工作、而萬連長還料不到他的夫人流波眞的做了間諜了、事情漸漸地證實、他自己也有些覺察後、萬運長也忽地受了一個莫明其妙的「擅離防地」的罪而革職、同時、參謀長送他手槍要他解决流波、終於在兒女情懐的戀念中、結果了這位夫人間諜、他寫這一段、正好透了極頂、</p>
<p>我用手將褲袋裏的勃朗林一面拿住、即將保險機扭開、很快的對準瑪利亞、（另一個女間諜）同時我嘴裏說、「手向上舉、快、快、」我眼睛正看着瑪利亞、不防流波陡的從衣袋裏拿出一個手槍來、我没等她端平、我覺得我的頭嗡嗡的聲就像一堆火燒似的、手稍向右一斜、照着流波、砰的一槍、我的眼前一團火一閃過去、流波倒地下了、瑪利亞剛要跑我心一動、算了吧、又一舉手、砰的一下、瑪利亞也倒了下、</p>
<p>街上的燈光一閃一閃的耀着、我們幾個人走的很快、我覺着眼前黑影裏隠約的有個流波和瑪利亞走着、我心中有點害怕和難過、……</p>
<p>看了這段描寫、在讀者、覺得異樣地痛快、他的心裏偏又這樣地憧憬着、把愛和敵、私和公、交戰着矛盾的心理、曲曲地寫了出來了、但他畢竟是個好男兒、</p>
<p>「不知怎的耳旁邊似乎有個人說了句、「你勝利了、你的祖國勝利了、」我的精神陡的振作了許多、司令部樓上的國旗、也不覺在我眼前顯現着了、……」</p>
<p>有了這一個曲折、使全文更覺生動、我想讀者都會感到的、而萬君也在這曲折　、恢復舊職、重走上火線去、</p>
<p>赤俄的不惜破壞非戰公約、甘願作</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>破壞和平的罪人、到現在、世界上都看到了、然而世界上再没有正義和公理可言、在當時、戰機初發、我國當局、還是一味鎭靜、希望和平談判、而結果讓成這個殘局、把整千萬的男兒熱血、犧牲在哥薩克的鐵蹄下、反而喪師失地、他寫初戰有這一段</p>
<p>大槪是八月十六日的早晨吧、東方剛剛現出了魚肚色、我們陣地對面的山上、隠隠約約的有許多隊伍向山下活動、天光　點一點的亮了起來、我們也看的清楚、是許多騎兵和步兵、（約千五百人、）先頭騎兵已經渡河一半了、向我們陣地前進、完全是密集隊形、我們這時已經向旅副報告、全線的兵們也都進了陣地、因爲奉到旅長命令、無論如何不許射擊、這時弟兄們的心裏都急的不得了、恨不能乘他們半渡而擊、一鼓殲敵、但是命令威嚴、大家只得伏在戰壕裏望著…………</p>
<p>凡是參入陣地的没有一個不恨得咬牙、簡直就嚷出打的聲音、但連排長的都虚心下氣的安慰、「命令要緊、」………………</p>
<p>我讀到這樣連接的幾段文字、眞感動得我怒火上升、想前線的戰士們已多少誤在這遲延裏呢、世界上原是早没有正義、自强才能有公理可言、直此千鈞一髮之交、當局者還是拚命鎭靜、那知自己的河山已給人蹂躙完了、這種情形、便是安泰地躱著遼遠的我們、看了報也覺得憤慨、何况躱著壕溝裏的作者、寫來自然更憤慨了、</p>
<p>但是一陣的交殺、戰士們都不能不瘋了似的前進、殺、殺、那管自己的陣壕已給敵人的砲火炸平、自己的弟兄、已經一百五十名犧牲在第一次的被襲中、終久把敵人打得像流水般退去、</p>
<p>我們不靈快的機關槍、打死了不少敵人、我們的兵都殺得高興起來、要不呌旅附嚷著、通通都渡過河那邊去了、</p>
<p>這時候的軍心何等地壯旺、作者把一顆顆赤心繪出在紙上、眞不知要感動了多少人、但是孤軍困守、後援不繼、同時該死的馮玉祥、又逞著危機作叛、而陣前的弟兄們、於是只在死守中待命、而赤俄的槍砲鐵蹄、有增無已的逐來、唉、戰士之罪歟、</p>
<p>他寫在滿洲里的幾段、眞的多麽雄壯</p>
<p>槍擱在胸墻上、後方飯也送不上來、大家只好忍著餓、等敵人不放了好吃東西、那知砲彈愈發飛來、我們堅决的守著、决不退後一步、旅長又傳來命令、—我們十五旅整個和滿洲里一齊犧牲、那個先退即行槍决、就這樣命令的一字一畫都印在我們腦子裏、無論敵人怎樣進攻、我們只要有一口氣一枝槍、也得和敵人拚…………</p>
<p>一分一刻鐘都在敵人的槍彈裏過下去、我眼看著我的一個親愛的弟兄就被砲彈炸死了、更傷了兩個、兩個鐘頭的過去、我的弟兄就十三四個炸傷、我眞有點發狂了、我不住跑上去撫摸死的身體、鮮紅的血流在戰溝裏、一片片的白色腦子四濺在壕上邊………………</p>
<p>中華民國十八年十一月十七日的早晨………………</p>
<p>他們聨合起來領受了梁司令的命令、—孩子們、爲祖國犧牲是光榮的、是偉大的、你們去幹啊、</p>
<p>經過了接連幾陣的猛攻、終久靠着堅定死守的精神、使赤騎不能即逞、最後、不幸的記載來了、——</p>
<p>「我們剛慶風波停息、那正面的敵騎又起始攻擊了、五千多名的騎士又被一陣子子彈打的差不多全數消滅、殷殷的血蹟、都留在漫漫的冰雪上、槍聲正停的當兒、敵人的飛機十多架飛過來、照着無線電台砰—砰…砰的投下炸彈、最後收到的一個無線電報、電台也就隨着炸彈的命運一齊頽倒了、</p>
<p>看到了「在這景色荒凉、凄慘悲壯的晚上、我接到了命令、—我營掩護我團背進、該連掩護我營背進……寂靜的夜氣也似乎含着悲哀的成分、」幾句話、眞有黯然銷魂之槪、「終至懐了滿腔熱血、在烽烟彈雨中突圍而出、悲憤地望着滿洲里的旗竿上換了敵的鐮刀斧頭、」</p>
<p>在全篇最後、以兩封回憶失守的信來作結、我覺得很好、同時可看得兩個軍人豪爽悲慨之情、躍然在不修飾的字句中、留着他們的本色、</p>
<p>總之、全篇洋洋六萬言、這裏殊不能再多舉、我覺得萬國安君雖則不死戰於陣中、終算有這六萬方可向國人贖戰退之罪、當此内叛外禍、相繼交迫的時機、這種創作、國人都該細讀來刺擊着頽唐、興奮起精神、（甚望有志於國産影片的人士、該把這點來取材、其偉大當超過「西線無戰事」十倍、在萎靡不振的中國、需要的是這種題材的影片啊、）</p>
<p>我還要不嫌詞費的引黃震遐的序文</p>
<p>「躱在關裏的民衆們、在大都市裏燈紅酒綠裏的人們、在亭子間裏發着牢騷的人們、中國的靑年們、你們還記得民國十八年十一月二十一日着可驚的件事麽、你們還記得在六千里外、在黃沙白草或是雪地冰天的國門之下有過幾千東北的健兒們英勇而悲哀地抵抗着赤色的恐怖麽、恐怕已經忘得乾乾凈凈了吧、如果已經忘記、請看「國門之戰」、」</p>
<p>末了、我更重複地說、「在貧弱的中國、還有此一役、在貧弱的中國文壇、還有此一文度」在此、謹向作者致敬禮、</p>

<p>范壽康編</p>
<p>我的弟弟在中學校讀書、最近、他寫了一封信來、呌我替他買些書寄去、</p>
<p>談起書、我們只要隨便走進那　書店裏、都是「汗牛充棟」、不過、我們要在這「浩如烟海」的書叢裏、想找到一本對於中等學生的善通學科的入門方法上、樣樣能給以精確的指導、這是很少有的、</p>
<p>我們很知道、「讀書有兩個要素、第一要精、第二要博、」如其是我們在某種學術上想要做到「精」的地步、那在知識則非先求得「博」的帮助不可、在中等學校的時候、對於各種課程上、如不曾打好切實的根底、到專門學校裏、也難希望達到高深的頂點、這樣、我們是怎樣地感到中等學生的課程重要啊、但是、我們若能得到一條最便捷的路徑、以達到學習最後之目的、在成功上說、則可以得到事半功倍的効率、所以、要促進中等學生對課業之易於理解、則對於一種修業方法的導引是如何地迫切需要啊、</p>

<p>人類没有學、人類不可以生存了人類没有學、人類也無須生存——一個永不進化的、荒棒單調的世界、生存在其上有什麽樂趣、所以我說、一生即須學、學即爲生」、</p>
<p>第二編、「我們怎樣學習國文」、也包有六篇國學專家的作品、前四篇是說明關於國學的研究方法和行文時的基本知識、後兩篇是列舉一個學習者應讀的書目、</p>

<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>十六日平靜無事、德軍進攻前天失敗了、現在不能有何良好的發展、香本前綫、德軍的攻勢已成强弩之末、</p>
<p>馬爾納河之南、敵軍未能把扼守橋堍的陣綫展開、敵軍所遇着的不僅是頑强的防禦、且有法國第六軍猛烈的反攻、阻止各處敵軍、甚至奪回了幾處要邑、假使我軍砲隊和空軍不斷的轟炸馬爾納河橋樑、使敵方援兵軍火等等、接濟困難、敵軍鐵里方面袋形陣地的底部必陷入險境、</p>
<p>敵軍在十六日所獲得的唯一進展是在里姆的西南凡斯爾河及馬爾納河之間、尤其沿馬爾納河一面、但這方面的進展是局部的、對於全局形勢無足重輕、更以犧牲甚大難於再進了、</p>
<p>用了兩天的力量、以冀挽回馬爾納河方面所獲得的不確定的利益、没有結果、德軍最高司令當然要躊躇不定了、敵曾高喊、戰而勝以重見和平、其結果又什麽樣呢、無非怨毒與欺詐、失敗的先驅罷了、全軍的軍心必因此大受打擊、</p>
<p>七月十七日、德軍已一蹶不振、十八日、聨軍的大砲便任預定的時間和地點轟擊如雷鳴、</p>
<p>前已記及、早在六月我已注意到沙亞松對於敵軍的重要性、因其地爲鐵路中心、對於鐵里方面深入的孤軍、接濟上是絶對不可少的、其地與我軍前綫相距不遠、向着此城採取攻勢、現已根據我六月十四日及六月十六日的計劃着手準備、孟琴司令的作戰計劃、在六月二十日亦已完成、從那時期以來、我便想到我軍反攻、自西東移、所得的結果、必較僅擾亂敵軍的交通爲大、</p>
<p>孟琴司令遂把其計劃逐漸擴展、以包括他在愛斯南河的防綫至奥爾克河他同法國第六軍左翼接連處中間的十五哩區域、他的兵力遂亦增加至步兵十八師、（其間有美軍第一第二兩師、）騎兵三師、七五砲二百四十尊、重砲二百三十一尊、空軍四十一隊、及坦克三百七十五部</p>
<p>第六軍司令狄高德報告、把第十軍向右伸展、計劃中的戰事擴展至奥爾克河的彼岸、他也能同樣的作戰、他已擬就計劃、由第六軍沿着奥爾克克列農之綫再取攻勢、第十軍在其左翼進攻、他要坦克一隊和步兵一兩師歸其支配、兵力增加之後、他共有作戰的軍隊八師之衆、攻勢戰綫即可擴展十六哩、</p>
<p>七月九日、我也想到第五軍在里姆至馬爾納河之綫向西同時進攻、但從那時以後、第五軍的形勢已變、現在祗能担任次要的軍事了、</p>
<p>其時、第十及第六兩軍出發的根據地、經過了幾次戰爭、已大有進步、沙亞松之西、第十軍已在克脫里至杜米爾的高原確定了陣地、更南、第十軍已奪著了鄰近高特勒森林的朗堡和谷西兩個村莊、其先頭部隊已向塞費爾小河之東挺進、第六軍在鐵里之西奪回了幾處要邑、如伏克斯諸村落、美軍第二師作戰成績甚佳、</p>
<p>德軍最高司令爲挽回危局起見、顯已把其軍隊分成兩部、一以扼守西面的戰區、一以奪取南面的新地、兩部兵力彼此不甚相埓</p>
<p>德軍以其雄厚的實力、總攻失敗一蹶不振的時候、我軍準備反攻的前途以及已經達到的成績大致如此、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e2">Generally Declared Over <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Northeast Armies Return to Respective Defenses</p>
<p>Shi's Troops to Be Reorganized into One Division and Brigade</p>
<p>Relief Funds Remitted from Central Government to Shandong</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shi's troops have been disarmed and dismissed by various armies for days. Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe have been captured. Shi Yousan's whereabouts are still unknown. The Northeast Army brigades will soon return to their respective defense areas. Dong Yingbin's brigade will return to garrison the Ping-Sui Railway. Heilongjiang's troops will withdraw beyond the Great Wall. The military action against Shi is generally declared over. Yu Xuezhong will return to Baoding today or tomorrow and then return to Beiping to report the combat operations to Zhang Xueliang. All the generals have achieved considerable merit in this campaign against Shi. Zhang Xueliang has sent telegrams of commendation and will request awards from the central government. The Southern Route Army will also withdraw to Henan Province. Gu Zhutong and Shang Zhen are both in Shijiazhuang. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although there have been rumors from the outside that Yan and Feng were involved in this disturbance, Feng Yuxiang is actually alone in Shanxi. The old generals all support the central government and are difficult for him to use. Yan Xishan has been living in Dalian for a long time, only reading and writing poetry, not talking about current affairs, with a leisurely attitude, and has no other thoughts. The Guangdong side, learning from the failure of the Enlarged Conference, does not value Yan. Yan's former status makes him unwilling to be subordinate to others, but the facts are too far apart, and all the reports are unfounded. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng, on the orders of Chiang Kai-shek, has been consulting with Han Fuju, Fan Pujiang and others for days on how to reorganize the remnants of Shi's troops. It is reported that they will be reorganized into one Class A division and one independent brigade according to the actual number of personnel. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Honglie, the director of the Northeast First Army's field hospital, reported that many of Shi's soldiers had died in the Dingzhou area. Today, he took doctors to the area for treatment. After recovery, they will be sent back to their hometowns. The spoils of the front lines will be transported to Beiping in the next few days and handed over to the deputy headquarters for inventory. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen, Liu Zhi, and Gu Zhutong departed from Shijiazhuang at 9:00 AM today and will arrive in Beiping at 5:00 AM tomorrow. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Shuchang telegraphed the headquarters on the 6th, reporting that Liu Guitang telegraphed that on the morning of the 5th, Shi Yousan led 3,000 infantrymen with pistols and their families, etc., and fled east from Zaoyang. Regiment Commander Zhai led a regiment of soldiers to attack for two hours, and Shi's soldiers fled eastward. Many spoils were seized. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gao Guizi telegraphed Beiping on the 6th, stating that Sun Guangqian had been captured by Chen Cheng's troops. Gao Jianbai is stationed in Gaocheng, and Wang Ziyi and Liu Jie are stationed in Huolu. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Yifei went to the Pinghan Railway Line this morning to represent Zhang Xueliang in comforting the front-line troops. Zhang Chengde, commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, accompanied him. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shi Yousan's Tianjin residence received a telegram from Shi on the 7th stating that he had safely arrived in Jinan. He hopes everyone can rest assured. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Yong, the director of the Pinghan Railway Beiping Office, left Beiping this morning to inspect the traffic conditions on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) As of yesterday, only over 3,000 of Shi Yousan's troops had arrived in Dezhou. They are a special service brigade. The headquarters is located in the Gong Sheng Inn in the South Gate. The soldiers are stationed in the Dofu Alley, three miles south of the city. They are all poorly clothed. Each person has no more than a dozen bullets. Among the senior officers is Huang, the chief of Shi's military law department, etc. Huang said that the Dezhou Organization Support Bureau was ordered to supply the division with provisions for seven days. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Jiang Bocheng said that the central government remitted 200,000 yuan for the accommodation expenses of Shi's troops. He has already transferred it to Chairman Han. Han said that more than 10,000 of Shi's troops have arrived in Shandong. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government has decided not to set up a special route for the reorganization of Shi's troops. Those surrendered soldiers who are physically fit will be allowed to replenish various units. All of Shi's troop salaries, 500,000 per month, will be used to assist other troops. The requests from so-and-so under Shi, hoping to set up a new 13th Route Army and retain two Class A divisions, etc., cannot be approved. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhi telegraphed that the war is over and all units should cease military operations. He himself will return south after the aftermath in Shijiazhuang has been properly negotiated. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Staff received a telegram from Jinan that Shi Yousan went from Wucheng to Dezhou and will come to Jinan today. Chairman Han still intends to receive him as usual. Approximately 27,000 of Shi's troops were disarmed this time. The approximately 20,000 men of Mi Wenhe and Sun Guangqian have completely retreated to the Dezhou area in northern Shandong, awaiting reorganization. Han has personally authorized Chief Commander Cao with full power of reorganization. Since yesterday, the Northeast Army has been successively transferred back to the rear, that is, back beyond the Great Wall. Only four brigades, including Guo Bai, etc., are left in Wuqiao and Shenze to clean up the remnants. The military action against Shi is generally over. A special dispatch. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications reported, according to the Pinghan Engineering Office, that Shi Yousan had destroyed many sections of the Pinghan Railway line, etc., and ordered them to quickly dispatch engineers and workers to repair them. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Ge Guangting, the chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, returned to Qingdao from Jinan on the evening of the 6th and told reporters that Shi's troops had indeed collapsed and that their division commanders, Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe, had also been captured. He also received a victory telegram from Deputy Commander Zhang, stating that he had ordered the cavalry brigade to search for the remaining enemies. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Mayor Zhang Xueming went to Beiping by car on the evening of the 6th to report on the city's public security situation and the fundraising efforts of various sectors to慰劳 front-line soldiers. He will return to Tianjin in two or three days. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Shang Zhen Resigns as Chairman of Shanxi Province <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shang Zhen requested Zhang to resign as chairman of Shanxi Province and commander of the army due to the complex military situation in Shanxi. He recommended Xu Yongchang to succeed him nearby. It is reported that the central government and the Northeast still hope that Shang Zhen will return to Shanxi because Shang's dispatch of troops to Niangziguan and Changzhi Lucheng did isolation work against Shi, which led to the rapid success of the campaign against Shi, which was not without merit. The date Shang returns to Shanxi is still to be seen. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Shuangying came to Beiping from Taiyuan this afternoon. Shang Zhen's representative Zhang Tao and Xu Mingshan, the chief of staff of the 4th Brigade, came with him. Fu went to the hospital to visit Zhang Xueliang and reported on the situation in Shanxi Province. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Various Armies Are Besieging Yudu</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Gather in Ganzhou</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang Telegram, (1) The bandits in Xingguo, belonging to Peng and Huang, attacked.</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>When taking the city, they captured more than 800 prisoners. On Dongmen Road, they trampled on each other, and many died. Peng and Huang barely escaped with their lives. The city was completely looted. Since the 5th, some refugees have returned to the city, but their families are all gone, and it is difficult to cook. The District Committee has telegraphed the province to request immediate allocation of funds for relief. (2) The remnant bandits in Ruijin are fleeing south to Yudu. Only a small number of peasant bandits are fleeing to Ruicheng. Various armies are besieging Yudu and will take it soon. (3) Chiang ordered the rear units to clear out the scattered bandits within a time limit so that they can rush to handle the aftermath. (4) More than 100,000 refugees from various bandit areas in southern Jiangxi have gathered in Ganzhou. The local garrison is trying to provide relief. (5) Traces of the Guangdong Army have been discovered at Dayuling on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi. The unit number is unknown. The anti-Red Army is dispatching teams to investigate. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang Telegram, Jiangxi bandits are fleeing to Fujian. Various anti-Red armies are using a large encirclement strategy to eliminate them. They are all attacking separately. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Luo Junqiang's Talk</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Progress of the Anti-Red Campaign in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Junqiang, Secretary-General of the Political Training Department, returned to Nanjing from Nanchang and will go to Shanghai in the next few days. According to him, (1) Chiang is still sitting in Nanchang and will not move for the time being. (2) The military situation of the anti-bandit campaign is optimistic. The past failures in suppressing bandits were not actually due to the strength of the Red bandits, but rather that the anti-bandit troops may not have been doing their best. Some even concealed defeats and embellished achievements in order to win false awards, which led to the increasing spread of the Red flames and the development of a serious situation. This time, Chiang supervised the suppression, unified command, and bravely advanced, so he was able to achieve repeated successes. Since the recovery of Donggu and Ningdu, three-quarters of the main force of the Red bandits has been eliminated, and the remaining remnants have fled to Yudu, Ruijin, Tingzhou and other counties. It is expected to come to an end by the end of the month. The aftermath of the recovered areas will be handled by the Party and Government Committee. The plan has been drafted, and the regulations and measures have also been formulated. Before the district commissioners set off separately, people used to say that the people in the bandit areas had been banditized and that the aftermath would not be easy. This is actually a cover-up and deception. It is possible that the people were coerced. (3) A small number of troops from Guangdong and Guangxi are now invading the border areas of Hunan and Jiangxi. In Hunan, there are Hunan troops sufficient to resist. In Jiangxi, there are currently 400,000 troops, with 200,000 suppressing the remaining Red bandits and 200,000 pacifying Guangdong. There is also great confidence. However, the central government still intends to give the Guangdong side a considerable period of repentance. It will never use force unless it is absolutely necessary. When the Anti-Red Army was launched, it was said that it would never hinder the Anti-Red campaign. Now, ignoring the country's survival, they are acting recklessly, and after the Han case, they even sent people to contact the Japanese side, which is even more appalling. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(1) Minister Wang Rongbao arrived in Beijing yesterday and gave a detailed report on the Korean incident. However, the written report has not yet been prepared. The Ministry will issue another serious note to the Japanese government based on Minister Wang's report.</p>
<p>(2) Ambassador to Japan Wang Rongbao, Ambassador to Denmark Luo Zhongyi, and Ambassador to Portugal Wang Tingzhang have all been ordered to return to the ministry.

<p>The Special Law on Punishing the Manufacture and Sale of Drugs</p>
<h3 id="e12">Conflicts with the Anti-Smoking Law <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Results of the Legal Committee's Review</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government submitted to the Legislative Yuan a special law on punishing the manufacture and sale of drugs, and the draft temporary regulations on punishing the manufacture and sale of danliao in Shanxi Province. After deliberation and decision by the National Government, it was submitted to the Legislative Yuan and has been reviewed twice by the Legal Committee of the Yuan. All agreed that the penalties for those involved in the manufacture and sale of poisons have already been stipulated in the Anti-Smoking Law, which seems to be more severe than the Criminal Law. According to the principle that special laws prevail over general laws, the provisions of the Anti-Smoking Law should naturally apply. If various executive agencies can vigorously enforce this law, it may not be possible to achieve the effect of prohibition. If, in addition to the Anti-Smoking Law, another special law on punishing the manufacture and sale of drugs is enacted, it would be a special law on top of a special law, which is inconsistent with legal precedent. Moreover, the original intention of the proposal is nothing more than to use the death penalty as a means of intimidation, which is certainly good intentioned. However, the people are not afraid of death, and the cunning see it as one hill of badgers. The prohibition is like hair, and the corrupt open the door to convenience, which is even more harmful to the facts. If the Anti-Smoking Law is considered to be more difficult to be effective, it may be possible to fundamentally revise the Anti-Smoking Law again. The committee has now prepared a review report and submitted it to the Yuan meeting for discussion on the 8th. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e19">(6) The Disaster Situation in the Pearl River Basin <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The Pearl River basin consists only of Guangdong Province. Guangdong is located on the coast of the South China Sea. The terrain is the lowest. The Pearl River runs horizontally and vertically southwest. The East, West, and North rivers branch off and irrigate, converging in Guangzhou. Every spring and summer, there are floods. The severity of the disaster depends on the amount of rainfall. This time, continuous rain caused the East, West, and North rivers to surge simultaneously, destroying the embankments, leveling houses, and drowning people and livestock. The disaster is extremely serious, even surpassing the great flood of 1915.</p>
<p>Along the North River from Guangzhou-Shaoguan Road to villages near Yuantan Station, everything is submerged. No roof ridges can be seen. The water in the rice fields is more than twenty feet deep, a vast expanse of water. The water depth in Qingyuan exceeds thirty feet. Refugees are scattered on the hills, waiting for death. Houses, farmland, and fruit trees have all been destroyed. More than 3,000 feet of the Guangzhou-Shaoguan Railway's roadbed has collapsed, with losses exceeding 400,000 yuan. In total, the North River disaster area includes Qingyuan, Yuantan, Qujiang, Yingde, Wengyuan, Shixing, Nanxiong, Hanguang, and other counties. In the area of Yingde, Qingyuan, and Yuantan alone, there are more than 300,000 disaster victims. Four or five thousand people have been drowned or starved to death. More than 100 refugees in Yuantan were living in a broken kiln. The kiln wall suddenly collapsed, burying more than 100 people alive, none of whom survived.</p>
<p>In the East River, the water of the Han River flowed down, causing the river to surge steeply. The Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Huizhou prefectures have all become marshes. Refugees are camping on mountain peaks, watching their fields and houses being swept away by the waves, wailing and crying to the heavens.</p>
<p>In the West River basin, Sanshui suffered the most severe disaster. A total of 126 embankments collapsed, and the entire county was submerged, two zhang deep in deep areas and five or six feet deep in shallow areas. More than 100,000 disaster victims fled to the mountains, with nowhere to live. The next was Sihui. Embankments in Sanpojong, Dazhou, Tong, Longtougang, Dongweidoukou, and other places in the county all broke, and fields and houses were submerged in the floodwaters.</p>
<p>This is the disaster situation in the Pearl River basin. As for Fujian, in the upper reaches of the Min River, in the Yanping area, the floods rushed straight down, with the provincial capital directly in the path. The entire city was flooded, with the water reaching the knees of the provincial government. In nearby villages, such as the Hongshuqiao Xixiang area, the water was as deep as two or three zhang. There is no hope for the fields, jasmine, pearl orchids, and cuckoo vegetables. The houses and livestock were swept away by the waves, and many people drowned.</p>
<p>In addition, the area along the Chinese Eastern Railway in the Northeast has also been flooded, but the reports are not detailed. In total, the flood-affected areas in the country include 16 provinces, nearly two-thirds of China's land. The flood-affected population totals more than 50 million, and the number of those who drowned has not yet been included. Such a huge disaster and such a tragic scene, although not unique, should be rare. If the people of the country do not immediately rise up to help each other with the noble spirit of humanity, when will they?</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways originally intended to complete the Lingbao-Tongguan section of the Longhai Railway in the shortest possible time. All construction funds for this section were originally designated to be allocated from the Boxer Indemnity's car price items that should be repaid by the Tianjin-Pukou, Pinghan, and Jiaoji railways. However, due to the impact of military affairs and floods, the income of the Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan railways has decreased sharply, making it difficult to repay as planned. Only the funds from the Jiaoji Railway, amounting to more than 39,000 yuan, can be transferred, which is not enough for the construction. The Ministry of Railways has now telegraphed Ling Hongxun, the deputy director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, stating that the construction must be temporarily adjusted and replanned according to the currently available funds that can be designated for allocation.

<p>National Referendum to be Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Fate of the Cabinet Depends on It</p>
<p>The United States to Extend Credit</p>
<p>Negotiations Are About to Begin</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 7th Dispatch: German Prime Minister Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius, along with the German Ambassador to Italy, Schubert, arrived here at 8:10 this morning. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Grandi greeted them at the station.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 6th Dispatch: The national referendum on dissolving the Prussian parliament will be held on Sunday. The opposing factions had temporarily suspended hostilities due to the economic panic, but now that the deadline is approaching, they have resumed their efforts and will fight hard for three days and nights. However, outdoor gatherings are being suppressed, so meeting halls throughout Prussia are filled with gatherings this evening. The police are busy dealing with them. This action was initiated by the Stahlhelm veterans association and is supported by the National Socialist Party, the German National People's Party, the Economic Party, and most of the National Party and the Communist Party. Those who oppose it are the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and the Center Party, which form the coalition government. The forces on both sides are evenly matched, and the outcome of the vote is difficult to predict. It can be said that this is a major event on the German political stage today.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 7th Dispatch: Today, the Prussian government, signed by all cabinet members, issued a declaration opposing the national referendum to dissolve the parliament and distributed it to more than 2,500 newspapers for publication. The German National People's Party's "Deutsche Zeitung" and the Communist Party's "Red Flag" had to publish it in prominent positions due to the emergency order that newspapers must publish official announcements free of charge. However, adjacent to it were equally fervent articles advocating for the vote, creating an interesting contrast. The Prussian government's declaration generally stated that the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party, two parties with opposing ideologies, had formed this unnatural alliance for the sole purpose of overthrowing the current government and then taking advantage of the chaos to push each other out. Therefore, it urged voters to obey reason, not to vote on Sunday, and to preserve the government that maintains law and order, not to allow it to be overthrown, which would greatly hinder the central government in dealing with the economic panic.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 6th Dispatch: The German government is about to implement a policy that is likely to arouse foreign opposition. It is said that this policy contains the following three points: (1) Suspending the payment of short-term foreign loans. (2) Deciding to stop various imports. (3) Deciding to increase exports, which is close to dumping. Prime Minister Brüning must now implement his policy so that foreigners feel that after President Hoover's war debt moratorium expires in July next year, they will have to reduce or cancel Germany's reparations obligations. Otherwise, extremely fierce export competition will continue indefinitely, causing harm to all parties. The German government issued an order today, ordering savings banks to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays. However, withdrawals exceeding 300 marks must be notified in advance. The German government has responded to the United States Department of Agriculture, stating that it is willing to purchase 600,000 bales of American cotton and may continue to purchase 200,000 bales, to be repaid over three years. However, it has made no indication regarding wheat. This action by the German government is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th Dispatch: According to reliable sources, the United States Ambassador to Germany, Sackett, will soon negotiate with the German Foreign Ministry and other relevant administrative departments on President Hoover's proposed long-term credit plan and Germany's willingness to purchase 600,000 bales of American cotton. There is currently no confirmed information on what possible results these negotiations will have. The German textile industry strongly opposes this, believing that it will greatly harm German trade and is a dangerous speculative undertaking because there is a large amount of cotton in the world. Bremerhaven, Germany's main cotton port, also has 377,000 bales of cotton, which can meet one-third of Germany's annual needs. If another 600,000 bales of American cotton are purchased, the Bremerhaven cotton market will be greatly hit.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 6th Dispatch: British Prime Minister MacDonald, accompanied by a woman, traveled 120 miles by car from Lossiemouth to a remote area in the Scottish Highlands to meet with United States Secretary of State Stimson and his wife. The Stimsons are staying in a century-old village house, which is eight miles from the nearest town of Rogart. It is rumored that the leaders of the two countries will discuss political events, but today the British Prime Minister explicitly stated that this is not the case, saying that they will only fish, walk, and enjoy the scenery, and not discuss politics.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th Dispatch: After arriving in Rogart yesterday, the British Prime Minister and Stimson attended a picnic on the mountain. However, the three left the gathering shortly after and strolled among the short bushes for about two hours. After returning, the British Prime Minister answered questions from guests, saying that there is an unspeakable peace here. If statesmen come here, they cannot have different opinions.

Other warships in the program include several aircraft carriers, six cruisers, one 10,000-ton six-inch gun cruiser, and one leader destroyer.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th Dispatch: It is widely rumored here that President Hoover is now planning to propose to the world's naval powers a two-year halt to naval construction.

<p>Shen Ke's Troops Gather in Quyang to Surrender</p>
<p>Han Designates Reception Area for Shi's Troops</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: Shi Yousan's troops fled southeast from Shulu, intending to retreat into Shandong. Today (5th), the Wucheng County government reported to the province by telegram that Shi Yousan and his younger brother Shi Youxin, Chief of Staff Tang Bangzhi, led a crowd of six to seven thousand people and arrived in the county at 6-7 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. Furthermore, the Shandong Provincial Party Department received a long-distance call from Xiajin today, reporting that a portion of Shi's defeated troops had arrived in the county today.</p>
<p>Regarding Dezhou, there were already rumors here yesterday about Shi's troops retreating to Dezhou. Today (5th), according to people from Dezhou, the Central Government ordered Chairman Han to receive Shi Yousan's defeated troops. The troops stationed in Dezhou were prepared early. On the evening of the 4th, a portion of Shi's troops began to arrive in Dezhou. Cao Fulin rushed to Dezhou that evening to handle the reorganization. The defeated troops offered no resistance, and the situation on the ground was peaceful as usual. Cao also ordered his troops to build a pontoon bridge over the canal west of the county to prepare for the bulk of Shi's troops to cross the river. It is also heard that a large portion of Shi's troops will arrive late tonight. It is still unknown who is leading the troops arriving in Dezhou.</p>
<p>Vice-Commander Representative Fan Pujiang came to Jinan yesterday. It is heard that when Fan met Han, in addition to reporting on the battle, he also stated Zhang Xueliang's opinion, roughly saying that Deputy Commander Zhang felt that Shi Hanzhang's surrender to the Central Government was due to his mediation, and the messengers traveled back and forth diligently, but ultimately it broke down. Moreover, the ones who broke down were precisely the Northeast Army, so he felt deeply saddened by this war. The Vice-Commander said that the overall situation in the north could not be maintained by him alone and still requested to share the responsibility with Commander Fang (Han's name). Han indicated that he also had the same feelings about this war. He could not dissuade Shi Hanzhang from his reckless actions, and since the war had already started, he was unable to send troops to help the Northeast Army to fight Hanzhang due to his special relationship with Shi. However, apart from this point, he obeyed all the orders of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander.</p>
<p>Today, Deputy Commander Zhang sent a telegram reporting on the situation of the pursuit at the front. The original telegram is as follows: "Jinan, Chief of Staff Jiang Bocheng, Chairman Ge Jingcen, Councilor Fan Shaoan, respectfully reviewed, respectfully reporting the pursuit situation, requesting your inspection: (1) According to Brigade Commander Yu Zhaolin's telegram from the 30th Brigade, the brigade commander led two regiments of infantry, covered by two armored trains, to Shizhuang, and has properly arranged with the troops under Chief Commander Shang to share the defensive duties there. Furthermore, according to Brigade Commander Jiang Shen's telegram, the brigade has captured dozens of damaged train carriages and more than twenty carts of flour at Changshou stations east of Ding County during the pursuit on the winter and river days. Four damaged armored vehicles and five cargo vehicles have also been captured. (2) There are one thousand and several hundred wounded soldiers left by the enemy in Dingzhou, and several hundred wounded soldiers left by the enemy in Shizhuang. No one is taking care of them, which is very pitiful. The rear hospital is urgently sending staff to set up a hospital for treatment. (3) According to Chief Commander Wang of the Second Army Corps' telegram from Hejian, the cavalry Second Division reported that the enemy had completely retreated at thirty noon, and the division came into contact with the enemy's First Division. The enemy had no ability to fight back, and countless military supplies were seized. According to the prisoners, Shi had retreated first, and Mi Wenhe and Sun Guangqian were holding the rear, retreating towards Dezhou, Shandong. Many guns and cannons were intercepted by the Central Army along the way. Furthermore, according to Cavalry</p>

<p>Dezhou Communication: The reporter took a train from Jinan to Dezhou today (5th) to investigate the reception of Shi Yousan's troops in Shandong. After getting off the train, I went to the headquarters of the 85th Brigade of the 29th Division at 29 Xinhua Street in the city. According to their Chief of Staff, Li Mingya, the Northeast Army has now stopped the attack. Shi's troops crossed the Hutuo River from Shulu to Shandong and requested reception. Chairman Han, upon the order of the Central Government, is receiving the troops, designating Gaotang and Linyi counties as their garrison area. This morning, about five or six hundred of Shi's cavalry brigade arrived in Dezhou and are currently stationed at Qilipu, south of the city. Tonight, five or six thousand of its special service brigade will also arrive in Dezhou. After a short rest, they will all be sent to the designated area to await roll call and reorganization.

<h3 id="e48">Suppressing the Red Army Captures Xingguo <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Besieged for Several Days, Killing Countless Bandits</p>
<p>The Remaining Bandits Were All Captured and Disarmed</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Xingguo is located south of Donggu, bordering Ningdu to the east, Yudu and Ganxian to the south, Taihe and Wan'an along the Gan River to the west, and Yongfeng and Ji'an to the north. The depth of banditry there is even greater than in Ningdu and Ji'an. It was originally one of the Red Bandit bases. Last year, when the 19th Route Army entered Jiangxi from Hunan, after capturing Lianhua, Yongxin, Wan'an, and Suichuan counties and stationing in Ganzhou, Yudu and Xingguo were also recovered by the army one after another. Various bandit nests in Xing territory, such as Jiangbei Cave, were destroyed by Cai's division. However, due to the defeat of Zhang Huizan's division, the army was ordered to reinforce Ji'an. When the Jiang and Cai divisions marched east from Ganzhou to Ji'an, no less than ten thousand civilians from Yu and Xing fled with the army. The army marched in the morning, and Xing and Yu fell to the bandits in the evening. After the Suppression Army recaptured Ningdu and Donggu this time, Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, and other remnants all fled to Yudu and Xingguo counties. The Suppression Army took advantage of the victory to continue the suppression. The bandit nests bordering Ningdu, Yudu, and Donggu, such as Gulonggang, Jinyizhai, Chenggang, and Liantang, were all captured one after another. Then, they surrounded Xingguo County. However, most of the bandits recently attempted to flee west again. Only two or three thousand bandits remained in the city, but they still stubbornly resisted. The Suppression Army then launched a fierce attack on the county seat. The air force stationed in Ji'an flew to the county seat every day to drop bombs. At the same time, the Suppression Army also used machine guns and artillery to fiercely bombard the bandit troops defending the city. Many bandits were killed and wounded. The remaining bandits could no longer hold on. The Suppression Army then captured Xingcheng at around 4 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. The bandits in the city could not escape and were all captured and disarmed. Various puppet agencies were also destroyed. According to the victory telegram sent by Zhao Guantao, roughly stating that tens of thousands of bandits in Xingguo were besieged by our various units for several days, killing countless bandits. Our 32nd Regiment first captured the county seat at 4 PM on the Zhi day. The remaining bandits were all captured and are currently being disarmed, etc. Since the 16th year of the Republic of China to the present, the bandits have occupied Xingguo most of the time. Therefore, families of the middle and upper classes have long since fled. The lower classes of society and local ruffians have formed a pact with the Red Bandits, plundering wantonly. Puppet Soviet governments have been established everywhere. All fields and houses have been confiscated. Now, not only are the fields desolate and the houses in ruins, but the boundaries of the entire county's fields have been leveled and cannot be distinguished. Those who have fled to Ganzhou and the provincial capital are still in exile. The disaster relief and reconstruction in the future will not be easy. (August 5th)</p>

<p>Nanchang Communication: According to the war zone headquarters bulletin, He Jian telegraphed that the Guangxi rebel Tan Yuanfang's troops have arrived at Shazipu and Taiyanpu in Quanzhou. Another part arrived at Huangsha River on the winter evening, and the bulk of Li Pinxian's forces will continue to advance towards Quanzhou and will soon be stationed in Yongzhou (Lingling) to join forces with Heng (Zhou) Bao (Qing). Furthermore, according to reconnaissance reports, the vanguard of the Guangdong rebel Li Yangjing's troops has arrived at Pingshi, and the bulk of Xiang Hanping's forces are concentrated in Shaoguan, all transporting supplies northward. It is heard that Commander-in-Chief Jiang has always focused on peace and that the Hunan Army and other armies have strict defenses, so he is currently focused on suppressing the Red Army, striving to completely eliminate all the Red Bandits in the shortest possible time. He has temporarily decided not to transfer troops elsewhere. Currently, the bulk of Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang's forces are hoping to flee west across Jiangxi, intending to seize weapons in the border area of Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi to reap the benefits. However, the left and right wings of the Suppression Army, in addition to pursuing the Red Bandits from Xingguo and Yudu, the Luo Lin and Gong Bingfan divisions are also deployed along the Gan River, such as Taihe and Wan'an, to block them. There are no other concerns. (August 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e50">External Report on Recent Diplomacy <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday (the 7th) dispatched Section Chief Bao Jing'an of the Intelligence Department to the Central Broadcasting Station to report on the recent diplomatic situation. His statement was as follows: (1) The Korean Anti-Chinese Incident: The most significant recent diplomatic event is the Korean Anti-Chinese incident. Due to the Japanese authorities' inadequate prevention beforehand and their failure to provide sufficient protection afterward, the lives and property of our country's overseas Chinese in Korea suffered extraordinarily significant losses. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese side. Ambassador Wang, stationed in Japan, who was ordered to go to Korea to investigate, has completed his inspection and is coming to Beijing to report everything. After receiving this report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should act in accordance with the Central Government's intentions and actively negotiate with Japan to achieve our desired goals. As for the Wanbaoshan incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also consulting with the Jilin Provincial Government to carry out separate negotiations. (2) League of Nations Conference: The 12th regular session of the League of Nations will be held in Geneva next month. The National Government dispatched Shi Zhaoji, Minister to England, Jiang Zuobin, Minister to Germany, and Wang Jiazhen, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, as representatives last month, with Minister Shi serving as the chief representative. Vice Minister Wang has already left Beijing for Harbin and will soon depart for Europe. Minister Jiang is expected to travel with Vice Minister Wang. As for the non-permanent council seat at this session, our country has high hopes, as we have been away from the League of Nations Administrative Council for three years. According to the election law passed in September 1926, we can be elected if we obtain more than half of the votes. Last year, our country requested re-election to the League of Nations, but according to the rules, it was necessary to obtain more than two-thirds of the votes to be elected. Therefore, our country received 27 votes last year, failing to be elected by a margin of five votes. If we can obtain the same number of votes at this session, which would be more than half, we should be able to be elected. However, our goal is to obtain a permanent council seat. (3) Recovery of the Mixed Court: The agreement on the establishment of a Chinese court in the French Concession of Shanghai was signed last week. The original text was published the day after the signing, and the French Concession's court was formally established on August 1st. The content of this agreement is largely the same as the Public Concession agreement established on February 17th of last year. However, there are one or two points that are even better. There are three Mixed Courts in China: the Shanghai Public Concession Court, the Shanghai French Concession Court, and the Gulangyu Court in Fujian. Now, the two Shanghai Courts have been recovered, leaving only the Gulangyu Court. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently working on recovery measures. (4) Recovery of Concessions and Leased Territories: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been preparing for the recovery of concessions and leased territories for a long time. Regarding the recovery of the Guangzhouwan leased territory, we previously sent a note to the French side requesting them to send representatives to begin negotiations, but the French side has not yet made a definite response. As for the recovery of the Hankou Japanese Concession, we also previously sent a note to the Japanese government requesting them to send representatives to negotiate, but the Japanese side has not yet responded. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently sent another note to the Japanese side, requesting them to begin negotiations quickly. The other concessions that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently planning to recover include the public concessions of Wuhu and Gulangyu; the British concessions of Tianjin and Shamian; the French concessions of Tianjin, Shamian, Shanghai, and Hankou; the Italian concession of Tianjin; and the Japanese concessions in various locations. (5) Matters Concerning the Development of Overseas Chinese Affairs: It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protect overseas Chinese. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' measures for protecting overseas Chinese are roughly divided into the following: (A) Negotiating with the governments of the host countries to remove obstacles to the conduct of overseas party affairs. (B) Negotiating the removal of various harsh regulations. (C) Coordinating the relief of unemployed Chinese laborers overseas. (D) Unifying the will of overseas Chinese to resolve the conflicts among Chinese societies in the Americas, in order to eliminate foreign anti-Chinese actions. (E) Rectifying overseas Chinese education. (F) Effectively promoting overseas Chinese registration to ensure thorough protection. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now actively pursuing these points separately. (6) Establishment of Consulates: In recent years, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established many new consulates overseas, such as the Taipei Consulate General and the India Consulate General. Recently, a vice-consulate was established in Mazatlán, Mexico, and a consulate was established in Seattle, in the western United States. The Ministry is currently preparing to establish consulates in Saigon, Haiphong, Kuala Lumpur, Pontianak, Tahiti, and Timor. It also plans to establish consulates in Guatemala, Ecuador, Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia, Guyana, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa, and Madagascar in French South Africa.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Japanese Consul Inspects the Situation of Overseas Chinese in Korea <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The purpose is to investigate our oppression of Koreans</p>
<p>Since we have no oppressive acts, we might as well let them investigate</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The Provincial Government previously received a telegram from Chief Zhou of the Changchun Municipal Office stating that an official from the Japanese Consulate in Changchun said that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs planned to send Consul Yanai and Vice-Consul Wu of Liaoning to inspect Korean settlements in Changchun and other counties, hoping for protection. Considering that this is a tense time in the negotiations of the Wan-Korean and Korean-Chinese cases, it is worth noting what the purpose is for these consuls to suddenly come to our territory to freely investigate the situation of overseas Koreans. After requesting instructions from the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, we received a reply approving their visit, but they were not allowed to bring Japanese police officers. We would send police officers to accompany and monitor them, and the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Liaoning would forward the itinerary of the consuls to the government. On the 25th of last month, we telegraphed Chief Zhou to send personnel to accompany them and to inform the Public Security Bureau to send police to monitor them. At the same time, we sent copies of the telegram to the local officials of the places they would pass through and to the public security bureaus of the cities along the Binjiang River in the provincial capital, instructing them to immediately order the police to receive and protect them when the consuls arrived. We also ordered the police districts they would visit to earnestly protect them and to adopt a peaceful approach to the Korean incidents. The purpose of this trip by the consuls is probably to investigate the facts of Chinese oppression of Koreans, so that they can use it as a pretext for future negotiations with us. Therefore, we must pay close attention to what the consuls talk about with the Koreans after arriving in the villages and what attitude they take in their interactions. The counties concerned must send knowledgeable personnel to assist and secretly monitor them. If any Koreans hang or wave Japanese flags to welcome them, they should be strictly prohibited in advance. After the fact, the monitoring and all the interactions between the Japanese and Koreans should be reported in detail. It is reported that the consuls arrived in Changchun on July 25th and will continue to inspect various places. The inspection is expected to be completed in about a month, and they will depart from Jilin on August 28th on their way home. (August 2nd)</p>

<p>Japanese Consul in Harbin Interferes with Public Opinion</p>
<p>Northeast Authorities Respond with Strong Words</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The Provincial Authorities recently received a report from the Preparatory Office of the Changchun Municipal Government stating that several tents erected by Japanese police at Majiashao had been removed. The Japanese police officers had moved into nearby civilian homes, with only two or three tents remaining, all occupied by Koreans. On the surface, the situation seems to have eased somewhat, and our people have not taken any drastic actions. However, it is reported that the Japanese Consul General in Harbin recently sent a letter to our diplomatic officials, saying that our people's hearts are agitated and harming Sino-Japanese relations, which is quite alarming. The original letter roughly stated: "The Korean riots in various parts of Korea caused by the Wanbaoshan incident are regrettable to everyone. However, according to subsequent intelligence observations, all of Korea has returned to peace. The Governor-General of Korea is thoroughly investigating the rioters and providing relief to the victims. The overseas Chinese in various places have also gradually begun their businesses. However, the newspapers in your country have recently published exaggerated articles on this issue, dedicated to stirring up people's hearts, which is truly a regrettable phenomenon in Sino-Japanese relations. Moreover, it seems that the propaganda is being directed by the Japanese. It is also said that Koreans attacked the Chinese Consulate General in Gyeongseong, and Consul General Zhang took refuge in the Governor-General's residence, which can be said to be inhumane slander. Furthermore, this Consulate General has received telegrams from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Governor-General of Korea, which can further prove that the facts are unfounded and beyond doubt. However, according to reports in your country's newspapers, powerful public and private organizations in the area seem to believe in the above rumors and are issuing fiery telegrams or speeches, merely inciting the excitement of the masses. Among them, there are even those who advocate economic severance between China and Japan. If this is allowed to continue, I am convinced that there will be no good results in improving Sino-Japanese relations. In the future, please properly suppress such malicious propaganda and do not allow it to continue." Upon investigation, the occurrence of this Korean incident was due to the fabrication of rumors and the malicious propaganda of various provocations and incitements in the Japanese and Korean newspapers, which aroused the anger of the Koreans and led to such a major tragedy. However, the Japanese authorities have not been heard to have taken any action against their newspapers, but they regard our expressions of pent-up grievances and unfair opinions as malicious propaganda and suppress them. This is truly excessive intolerance. It is reported that our officials, after receiving this letter, have responded with strong words.</p>

<h3 id="e54">New Reforms of the South Manchuria Railway Company <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>All Power Concentrated in Shenyang</p>
<p>President Handles Diplomatic Affairs</p>
<p>Northeast Authorities Should Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: Since Uchida and Eguchi succeeded as President and Vice-President of the South Manchuria Railway Company (SMR), the Japanese policy toward Manchuria and Mongolia has changed accordingly. It has been many days since Uchida and Eguchi took office. Their first step is to reform the SMR's organizational structure and personnel changes, which are described below:</p>
<p>Organizational Reform: The newly reformed SMR organizational structure has six departments - General Affairs, Management, Supervision, Railway, Local Affairs, and Commerce - and one Technical Bureau. The General Affairs Department directly manages five offices: the Tokyo Branch, the Fengtian Office, the Harbin Office, the Fushun Coal Mine, and the Anshan Iron Works. The Supervision Department has two sections: Investigation and Management. The Management Department has two sections: Budget and Accounting. The Railway Department has eight sections: General Affairs, Management, Operations, Joint Transportation, Rolling Stock, Engineering, Ports, and Electricity. The Local Affairs Department has seven sections: General Affairs, Local Affairs, Education, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture, Health, and Construction. The Fengtian Office under the General Affairs Department is particularly noteworthy. The Fengtian Office was originally the Fengtian Public Office. This time, it has been upgraded from the Fengtian Local Affairs Office to the Fengtian Office and is under the General Affairs Department. The General Affairs Department reports directly to the President. The SMR's negotiation affairs have been transferred to the management of the Fengtian Office, which means they will be handled directly by the SMR President. Therefore, all the power of the SMR will be concentrated in Shenyang. This is the most noteworthy aspect of this reform. Mr. Uchida is a well-known diplomat. From the beginning of his appointment, commentators said that he would demonstrate his diplomatic skills. This time, he resolutely placed the SMR's negotiation affairs under his iron fist. This is a new reform of the Japanese policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia in the past thirty years. The long-stagnant Northeast Railway negotiations, with the SMR's external power now shifted to Shenyang, may see a new situation develop as a result.</p>
<p>Personnel Changes: According to SMR tradition, whenever the President is replaced, all the staff are also changed. This time, with Uchida and Eguchi taking office, it is no different. The most important personnel changes this time include the replacement of the heads of the General Affairs, Management, and other departments with new personnel. The SMR's affiliated organizations, such as various schools, have also been changed. The new Director of the General Affairs Department is Mr. Yamauchi, the Director of the Management Department is Mr. Shuto, the Director of the Supervision Department is Mr. Takenaka, the Director of the Railway Department is Mr. Murakami, the Director of the Local Affairs Department is Mr. Omori, and the Director of the Commerce Department is Mr. Sogawa. The heads of local offices in various places have also been changed: Hiraoka Yasuo for Dashiqiao, Momma Kenichi for Yingkou, Kawasaki Inokichi for Anshan, Maeda Etsuo for Tieling, Ogawa Takuma for Kaiyuan, Mori Kageki for Gongzhuling, Yuoka Shigeru for Changchun, and Tada Akira for Andong. The staff of the Andong-Fengtian Railway have also been greatly changed, from stationmasters to drivers, all replaced with new personnel. The new stationmaster of Andong Station is Chiba Katsuo, and the former stationmaster, Orida Yushin, has been transferred to the Dalian Transportation Office. All the newly appointed personnel took office at the end of July and the beginning of this month. Therefore, recently, there have been many SMR personnel traveling back and forth on the South Manchuria and Andong-Fengtian Railways. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Detailed Account of Wang Junjie's Murder of the Division Commander <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Wang and those Involved in the Conspiracy Were All Captured</p>
<p>He Zhenfan Died Three Days After Being Shot</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wang Junjie, Brigade Commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 34th Division of the Army, plotted to seize military control of the division and assassinated He Zhenfan, the Acting Division Commander, on July 14th in the defense area of Xiantaozhen, as previously reported. He Chengjun, Director of the General Headquarters, believed that Wang's behavior was rebellious and that he should be dealt with according to the law to rectify military discipline. However, considering that Wang was leading troops in the defense area, and the division's mission area was distributed across more than 300 li of key areas in Xianmian, he was concerned that hasty action might have other impacts, so he temporarily tolerated him. After Wang killed He, he sent Yao Yingcheng, the division's adjutant, to Hankou to visit Director He, stating that He had died of illness and that Wang was maintaining the defense area, reluctantly complying with the request of all the division's officers to temporarily act as division commander and await further orders. Director He used the tactic of feigning leniency to entrap the enemy, speaking kindly to Yao and immediately appointing Wang Junjie as the Acting Division Commander of the 34th Division. He ordered Yao to personally bring the letter of appointment to the Xiantao defense area, instructing Yao to reassure Wang that he should secure the military, work hard to suppress the Communists, and that he would find special ways to provide whatever was needed. The General Headquarters' attitude towards Wang was seemingly extremely favorable. Yao deeply believed this and happily returned to Xiantao to report back, carrying Wang's appointment letter as Acting Division Commander of the 34th Division. Furthermore, Director He fully agreed to all the promotions recommended by Wang for battalion and brigade commanders, and decided to announce them according to procedure. Wang and his subordinates secretly congratulated each other and strongly urged Wang to come to Hankou to thank Director He. Soon after, Director He telegraphed Wang to come to Hankou for consultation. Wang was overwhelmed by this favor and, together with Yao Yingcheng, Wang's Chief of Staff Zhao Jizhi, the newly appointed Chief of Military Law Chen Boyan, and eleven followers, arrived in Hankou on August 3rd. On the morning of August 3rd, Wang, together with Yao Yingcheng, visited Director He at the General Headquarters. He was immediately arrested and handed over to the military law department. At the same time, personnel were dispatched to the World Hotel to arrest Zhao Jizhi, Chen Boyan, and the eleven followers, and they were detained in the military law department and the detective office. It is reported that the General Headquarters plans to organize a military tribunal to try this case. Director He has also telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang regarding the details of handling this case, as Chiang is paying extraordinary attention to this case and has long instructed He to handle the case with full authority. As for the details of the case, it is said that Wang Junjie was indeed the mastermind behind He Zhenfan's murder. Those involved in the conspiracy included Wang's Chief of Staff Zhao Jizhi, the head of the pistol company Li Xiuzhi, and a person named Hu. The time of He Zhenfan's murder was 4:00 AM on July 14th. Wang initially ordered Zhao, Li, Hu, and others to lead their troops and surround He's residence before dawn. Then, they disarmed He's guards and imprisoned them. They dragged He out of bed and Wang, Zhao, Li, and others used their pistols to escort He to Wang's brigade headquarters. Along the way, they punched and kicked him, leaving him covered in bruises. At the time, He's only follower was a soldier named Liang Zixiu, who was unable to resist. Upon reaching the entrance of Wang's brigade headquarters, Wang first shot He in the lungs, with the bullet exiting his back. As He turned his head to speak, another bullet grazed his tongue and exited his left jaw. He cried out in pain, saying, "Please quickly aim at my head and give me a quick death." Another shot came, but it missed. At this time, Zhao and Li struggled to shoot soldier Liang, and a bullet entered his waist. Liang pretended to be dead. After everyone dispersed, he endured the pain and secretly fled to Hankou, where he secretly informed He Zhenfan's family and received treatment in the hospital. After Wang, Zhao, Li, and others shot and wounded He, seeing him lying on the ground bleeding profusely, they ignored him and sent their troops to guard the various organs of the division. At the same time, they detained Wang Wenshan, the division's chief of ordnance, Zhang Xianghe, the chief of military law, and Dong Fangting, the commander of the 2nd regiment, and Wang Jichang, the commander of the 6th regiment, who were summoned to Xiantao to attend the bandit suppression conference (the conference closed after three days). They fabricated telegrams to various places, falsely claiming in the name of all the officers that He Zhenfan had resigned due to illness and that the officers and soldiers had elected him as the acting division commander. They also guaranteed Hu as the commander of the 2nd regiment, Sun Yaowu as the commander of the 6th regiment, Li Xiuzhi, Xu, and others as battalion commanders, Chen Boyan as the chief of military law, and Dou as the chief of ordnance. They sealed off Xiantao, detained the post and telegraph, and cut off communication, so that the officers and soldiers of the division stationed in various places gradually learned the truth of the case after a long time. It is also reported that after He Zhenfan was shot and fell to the ground, he was still moaning in a pool of blood until 4:00 PM that day. After numerous officers and soldiers repeatedly requested it, Wang finally allowed him to be taken to the Xiantao Catholic Church, but he was still monitored and not allowed to eat or drink freely. He died at 7:00 PM on the 17th. However, on the 16th, He wrote two dying letters while lying in bed and secretly sent them to Hankou by a trusted aide, who presented them to two different offices. He did not pass away until the 17th. Upon investigation, Wang had previously murdered Liu Peng, the commander of the New 1st Division, in Yichang, and plotted to murder Li Yunlong, the commander of the New 3rd Division, in Dean. This time, killing He was the third time he had murdered a superior officer. Wang first betrayed Cao Wanshun, then betrayed Zhang Weixi, and betrayed Li Yunlong three times. This time, betraying He was the fourth time he had betrayed someone. He can truly be said to be rebellious by nature. (Night of August 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Anti-Shi Military is Preparing to Demobilize <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Shi is Scattered Among the Disordered Troops and Military Operations will Conclude</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: According to the Security Department, the anti-Shi military operations are about to end. Since Shi's forces were surrounded and attacked by the Northeast Army and the Southern Route Group Army, there was no way out. After the Southern Route Army occupied Shijiazhuang and the Northeast Army occupied Dingzhou, Shi's forces scattered in the Cangshi Road area. The Pinghan Railway is now clear, and the Jinpu Railway has not yet been reached. The Wang Shuchang and Han Fuqu's troops blocked the west from Cangzhou and Dezhou, and the forward units of Shang Zhen's Jin Army will exit Niangziguan and head east. Shi is in a critical and isolated encirclement. Therefore, after the battle of Shijiazhuang, Shi fled with the disorderly troops. His whereabouts are currently unknown. The remainder of his forces, in addition to those who were disarmed and captured, may be reorganized by Han Fuqu. The Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route Army, Liu Zhi, has arrived in Shunde, and Gu Zhutong is accompanying the army to the front. Wang Jun inspected the Daoqing Line, and the troops are advancing. However, since the military operations have been concluded, the main forces will soon demobilize. The various units of the 3rd Army Corps may soon return south. Qian Zongze, the transportation commander of the Jinlong and Pingdao Four Routes, telegraphed Yin Dihuang, the director of the Pukou Office, on the 5th, stating that the rebel Shi had been fundamentally resolved, the military operations had been concluded, and the main forces were urgently awaiting demobilization. All military supplies in the rear should cease to be transported forward to avoid wasted effort. Empty trains should be prepared and concentrated between Xuzhou and Guide to prepare for military transport. In particular, the Guard Army should be limited to concentrating in Pukou before steam. On the same day (the 5th), the 3rd Independent Artillery Regiment, which was heading north from Pukou, was ordered to turn back. The forward units are also being mobilized for demobilization.

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Red Bandits, led by Luo Zhu and others, have repeatedly requested the Central Government to send more troops to Fujian for a joint suppression. It is reported that the Central Government has dispatched the Wei Lihuang Division to enter Fujian from Jiangxi. They will first meet with Zhang Zhen's division in western Fujian to eliminate the remaining Reds in Tinglong and other places. Then, they will meet with the Provincial Government and the various armies to reorganize military and political affairs. The expenses for bandit suppression will be provided by the Central Government. The Provincial Government has telegraphed its welcome and urged them to come as soon as possible. The Provincial Government has also ordered the Lu Division to go to Liancheng and Changting to fill the defenses. Commander-in-Chief Chiang has also ordered the Lu Division to arrive before the 5th of this month. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the refugees from Changting petitioned the Provincial Government for three things: (1) to quickly find ways to accommodate the refugees from Tingzhou scattered in various places; (2) to quickly send a large army to recover the counties of Changting; and (3) to quickly allocate funds to relieve the refugees in Tingzhou who have suffered from the disaster.

<h3 id="e58">The Hunan Provincial Government Newly Formulates a Prohibition Plan <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Current Tobacco Tax is Approaching One Million</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: A large amount of tobacco soil is transported to Hunan from Guizhou every year for sale. Therefore, the government has specially established a special tax clearing office to collect special taxes. A special tax of 400 yuan is levied on each dan of tobacco soil, excluding the protection fee. The total monthly revenue is about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan, and can reach more than 1 million yuan in peak months. Originally, half was handed over to the Ministry of Finance and half was retained by Hunan as military expenses. Later, due to the difficulty of military expenses in Hunan, He Jian requested and was approved by the Central Government that all of this special tax, starting from July, would be retained in Hunan for military expenses and no longer handed over to Beijing. Tobacco soil that has been affixed with flowers and paid taxes can be openly sold, which greatly hinders the prospects of tobacco prohibition. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee telegraphed the Central Government, requesting it to resolutely abolish the Hunan special tax in order to eliminate the poison. Whether this will be approved has not yet been received. However, the Hunan Provincial Government has formulated an administrative outline for the 20th year, which was passed at the provincial affairs meeting the other day. For the tobacco prohibition measures for the 20th year, eight items are stipulated, which will be reported to the Central Government and promulgated for implementation. According to the various items stipulated in the measures, such as prohibiting planting, transporting, selling, and smoking, Guizhou tobacco soil can no longer be transported to Hunan in the future, and the so-called special tax has been fundamentally abolished. However, the military expenses of the 4th Army Corps rely entirely on special taxes for funding. Although the tobacco prohibition measures have been passed by the provincial government, whether they can be implemented depends entirely on whether the military agrees. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) Supervise and order the entire province to strictly prohibit opium. (2) Select personnel to inspect tobacco prohibition in various cities and counties. (3) Strictly examine the achievements of tobacco prohibition personnel and reward or punish them accordingly. (4) Plan to establish a provincial tobacco prohibition committee. (5) Prohibition of planting: 1. Strictly prohibit the planting of poppies. 2. Order areas planting tobacco to implement the replacement of various agricultural crops. 3. Strictly order the county magistrates to conduct on-site inspections of tobacco seedlings. 4. Select personnel to review tobacco seedlings. (6) Prohibition of transportation: 1. Strictly prohibit the import of tobacco soil. 2. Inspect boats and vehicles for privately transported opium. 3. Strictly order public security agencies to identify merchants transporting tobacco soil and order them to issue a written pledge never to transport tobacco soil. (7) Prohibition of sales: 1. Strictly prohibit the manufacture and sale of tobacco soil and smoking paraphernalia, and seal off their business premises. 2. Search for hidden tobacco soil, residual膏, and smoking paraphernalia, confiscate and destroy them. (8) Prohibition of smoking: 1. Strictly prohibit the opening of brothels for people to smoke opium. 2. Those who are caught smoking opium will be ordered to quit smoking within a limited time. 3. Supervise and urge various cities and counties to establish addiction treatment centers and addiction treatment clinics, and encourage individuals or groups to establish addiction treatment clinics. 4. Crack down on addiction treatment drugs. 5. Review the use of the 20% of addiction treatment funds spent by various cities and counties. 6. Implement drug testing for civil servants. 7. Plan to establish a civil servant drug testing center. 8. Strictly order the waterway and land public security agencies to investigate tobacco offenders. (August 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e59">Repercussions of the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection's Excessive and Harsh Inspections <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Chamber of Commerce and Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>Request the Control Yuan to Dispatch Personnel for Thorough Investigation and Strict Punishment</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection has previously implemented improper inspection procedures, causing dissatisfaction among merchants, leading to repeated strikes and business closures. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations, due to Bureau Chief Mou Junde's disregard for public opinion, excessive and harsh inspections, have seen their industries decline daily, which is contrary to the original intention of the state in establishing the bureau. Therefore, they decided in a meeting yesterday to jointly send a telegram to the Control Yuan to file a complaint, requesting the dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate the bureau's accounts and severely punish them to maintain commerce. The original text of the telegram is recorded below: To President of the Nanjing Control Yuan: The Qingdao Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection's excessive and harsh inspections are harming merchants and the people. We earnestly request the dispatch of personnel for thorough investigation to ensure its reputation matches its reality and to alleviate the distress of Jiangsu merchants. Upon investigation, the establishment of the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection was originally intended to improve products and increase credibility. The inspection fees charged should only be sufficient to cover inspection expenses and should not be comparable to a national tax collection agency. Taking from merchants and using for merchants is clearly stated in official documents and known throughout the country. However, Bureau Chief Mou Junde and others are greedy and exacting, imposing harsh levies. At the beginning of operations, they still knew to adhere to some boundaries, but in recent years, they have intensified and acted recklessly, using the name of inspection to secretly pursue private collection of fees. For example, crude oil is charged nine cents per dan, soybean oil nine cents per dan, peanut kernels five cents per dan, peanuts three cents per dan, cotton six cents per dan, peanut cake one cent per dan, pork one yuan and six jiao per dan, egg products three cents per dan, fresh eggs two cents per thousand, live cattle five jiao per head, raw cowhide five jiao and five fen per dan, frozen cowhide five jiao per dan, beef tallow two jiao per dan, and wool nine jiao per dan. Based on the quantity of the above items transported and sold to various places by the Jiaohai Customs in the 19th year, the inspection fees collected should amount to more than 300,000 yuan. As for silkworm cocoons, tobacco leaves, soybeans, and coarse grains, none are spared. Furthermore, the bureau often uses inspection as a pretext to extract samples of goods in large quantities, causing losses to merchants and people who dare not complain. They must not only pay various huge amounts of money but also suffer various harsh and cumbersome disturbances. Even the pork needed for daily use by the people of this city is subject to inspection fees, but in reality, no inspection is ever carried out; only personnel are sent to collect fees without issuing formal receipts, which is even more shocking. It is estimated that the annual amount of illegally collected fees is no less than 400,000 yuan. Under the name of an inspection agency, they are actually acting as a collection agency, which has repeatedly aroused strikes and business closures by members of various trade associations, with significant direct and indirect consequences. Their appeals have been ignored. Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places have all established bureaus, but there have been no reports of such harsh treatment. Without even the need for promotion, Qingdao's commerce has already been almost completely destroyed by Mou Junde and others' deceptive tactics and cruel flames of greed. In a state of urgency and desperation, we jointly send this telegram to earnestly request your esteemed Yuan to promptly dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the bureau's accounts and severely punish them to rectify official conduct and maintain commerce. We are filled with anticipation and await your orders. Qingdao Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Native Products Merchants Association, Pork Trade Association, Egg Trade Association, Cigarette Trade Association, Cotton Yarn Trade Association, Chinese and Foreign Cotton Cloth Trade Association, Money Trade Association, Restaurant Trade Association, Shipping Trade Association, Transportation Trade Association, General Merchandise Merchants Association, Silk and Satin Cloth Merchants Association, Straw Hat Weaving Trade Association, Inn Trade Association, Yellow Wine Trade Association, Banking Trade Association, Liquor Trade Association, Automobile Trade Association, Coal Trade Association, etc., respectfully kowtow.

<h3 id="e60">Wuhu Express News <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Dangtu County, which is connected to Wuhu, has 900,000 mu of fertile land. The largest, Daguan Embankment, occupies 480,000 mu. Since the major flood, the villagers of the entire embankment have exerted their utmost efforts to prevent breaches and have preserved it until now. Unexpectedly, the embankment, which had been submerged for a long time, suddenly collapsed the night before last. Although the villagers tried to save it by beating gongs, it was impossible to recover. The breach caused a disaster, flooding more than 600,000 mu of land in the surrounding embankments, resulting in huge losses.</p>
<p>The flood in Anhui Province is unprecedented in decades. Southern Anhui is the primary rice-producing region in the country, and the losses are even greater. In addition to the Wuhu Flood Relief Association, people from various counties residing in Wuhu initiated the establishment of the Wuhu, Xuancheng, Nanling, and Fanchang Four-County Relief Association yesterday to cooperate fully. The founding meeting was held at the county government, and Zhai Zhancheng, Yu Bohua, and ten others were elected as committee members to raise donations from inside and outside the province and organize work relief.</p>
<p>Due to the severe flooding in Wuhu, the fields and crops have been almost completely submerged, and there is no source for land tax or educational surcharges. The county's education system is facing bankruptcy. The Education Bureau and the Education Promotion Association have held meetings for days and resolved to levy entertainment taxes and streetlight pole surcharges, and also plan to close down elementary schools in various rural areas, as the embanked fields have become a waterland and the farmers cannot settle down and even if they did, it would be futile.</p>
<p>Since raising dozens of yuan in relief funds, the Wuhu Flood Relief Association has been hiring boats to distribute money, rice, and bread to provide temporary relief. To devise a fundamental solution, it has divided into groups to investigate the number of disaster victims and the flooding of embanked fields. Zhao, the head of the Public Security Bureau, and others took a boat to various villages yesterday to investigate. In addition, the association has nominated committee member He Wuzi to go to Shanghai today to request urgent relief from Xu Shiying, chairman of the Central Relief Committee.</p>
<p>Defense in Wuhu has been tightened in recent days. The police authorities specially sent people to announce to residents last night that firecrackers are prohibited from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM, because pirates have been rampant across the river for days, and the sound of gunfire continues throughout the night, causing unease. Robbery cases have sprung up in the four townships like bees. The Shiwei Town Public Security mistakenly killed five thieves yesterday. The county government has arrested even more people in recent days. Xie Caixing and Yang Jiahe were executed last night. The 271st Brigade Headquarters dispatched troops across the river last night to patrol. (June 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e100">Dramatic Speech Leads to Serious Illness... Not Death Due to Exercise <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>(Osaka Dispatch) Japan's world-renowned track and field star, Miss Kinue Hitomi, unfortunately passed away due to a sudden onset of pneumonia at 0:25 PM on the 2nd of this month, as previously reported in this newspaper. Her death was largely suspected to be due to overexertion, causing concern for female athletes in general. However, the lady's death was definitely caused by the strenuous speeches she delivered across Japan after returning from the Third World Women's Games in Czechoslovakia last year. Due to lack of rest, her lungs were damaged, and she subsequently contracted pleurisy. Her condition gradually worsened, and she was admitted to Osaka Medical University Hospital for treatment in April of this year. She showed slight improvement by the end of May, but her body continued to weaken. Despite proper care, the disease had penetrated deep into her bones. Suddenly, on the afternoon of January 1st, a critical change occurred, and her life was in danger. Doctors administered dozens of cardiac stimulants, which prolonged her life until the following day. At the moment of her death, she still showed her indomitable spirit, writing a final note, saying, "Victory and defeat are things of the past; a chest ailment has taken my life." Her remains were cremated at the Osaka Abe Crematorium on the afternoon of the 3rd. The lady was born on January 1, 1907, originally from Fukuhama Village, Mitake County, Okayama Prefecture, as the second daughter of Mr. Inosaku Hitomi. She graduated from Okayama Prefectural Girls' High School in 1924. In 1925, she entered Nikaido Gymnastics and Women's School but did not graduate. Later, she served as a gymnastics teacher at Kyoto Girls' High School. In April 1926, she entered Japan Women's College of Physical Education, but withdrew the following year to become a correspondent for the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun. In August, she participated in the Second World Women's Games in Sweden, winning first place in the individual overall score and breaking four world records, thus making her name known worldwide. After returning to her country, she became an employee of the Mainichi Shimbun. In 1928, she attended the Ninth World Games, and last year, she also attended the Third World Women's Games in Czechoslovakia, winning every time. She held one-third of the world records, and almost all of the Japanese records were kept by her.</p>

<p>Eat as Much as You Want</p>
<p>Several restaurants in New York, for company dinners, never allowed extra dishes beyond what was listed on the menu. Recently, to attract customers, they changed the method. If there is something delicious in a company meal, customers can ask the restaurant to add more of it and eat as much as they want without extra charge. Since the implementation of this method, the business has flourished, but only 5% of customers have asked for a second serving. So there is not much loss.</p>

<h3 id="e102">In Memory of My Late Friend, Ye Ziping Zhong <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Pengfei</p>
<p>Sima Xiangru said, "A thousand gold sons do not sit under a dangerous eave." It is because their lives are precious, and they dare not lightly tread into danger or face unexpected events. How could my friend Ye Ziping Zhong, a scion of a noble family, forget this warning and playfully indulge in Fucha's water games, only to follow Qu Yuan's long journey, leaving eternal regret? Ziping Zhong's given name was Dan, and he was from Zhouzhuang near Suzhou. He was the second son of Mr. Ye Chucang, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. At the age of seventeen, he studied at Shanghai Nanyang Middle School for many years. He was kind and approachable, not tainted by current habits. He was always diligent in his studies and devoted himself to school affairs selflessly. Therefore, he was highly respected by his classmates. He served as chairman of the class meeting and minister of the Department of Moral Education. His achievements were remarkable. Ye Zi always bravely stepped forward in matters relating to the class, never retreating slightly. He was fond of learning and thinking deeply about his studies, always ranking at the top of his class. Last winter's exam, because his physics score was slightly inferior, he worked harder this spring and finally ranked at the top. Not only were his classmates delighted, but his teachers also praised him. After class, he studied various ideologies and theories. Whenever he gained insight, he would write articles of thousands of words, neglecting sleep and food. He especially loved poetry. His works were often seen on the school's bulletin board. A few days ago, he sent me four seven-character quatrains, written after reading the novel "A Laughing Story." He was sincere and devoted to friendship. He was modest in his discussions of art and learning. He had the demeanor of a son of Shangqiu. Now, he has suddenly drowned while swimming. How can I not be saddened by this bad news? Ye Zi was not good at swimming. The first time he swam was this summer, on the Sunday before the big exam, when he practiced with his classmates at the Hongkou swimming pool. Unexpectedly, after returning to the town, he went into the water in the canal. He did not think of the words of Zichan, "Water is weak, and playing with it leads to death," and thus never recovered. Feng Yi raged and destroyed my good friend. Oh, destiny! Looking back to last winter, I traveled to Jingkou with my two younger brothers, Wu Zizhaozong and Yifei. After arriving in the town, we visited Ye Zi. We received a warm welcome and enjoyed the scenic spots of Jinshan, Jiaoshan, and Beigushan together. Although the north wind was fierce and the snow had just stopped, Ye Zi guided us warmly without any difficulty. We traveled for two days without separating. If I come again in the future, the scenery will be the same, but the man and his music will be gone. How can I not be heartbroken? I remember when we parted during the summer vacation, Ye Zi still asked about the date of my revisit to Jingkou. I told him that I would definitely go to the town during this holiday for a ten-day visit. How could I know that the words were still in my ears, but Poseidon took my old friend away? The past is like yesterday. I am heartbroken. Therefore, I wrote two odes to remember my old friend to express my pain. "Grief overflows. The friendship in the study window is deep, but the fate is shallow. Yangguan's song has just been sung, but sorrow is already foretold. How can I not be confused upon hearing the rumors? From now on, who will accompany me by the lamp and the cockcrow? Remembering our time together, my heart is broken. The waves cannot wash away my sorrow. Heaven's questions are unanswered. The setting sun turns to the west." "Playing in the clear waves, he followed Qu Yuan to the Miluo River. Zhong Qi is gone, and there are few who understand my music. The sound of the guqin is desolate. The two points of Jinshan and Jiaoshan are still the same. How can I bear to mention them again? I hear the tide rushing through the fog. I mourn my lost companions. I look at the Jingjiang River as far as the eye can see. Where can I call back his soul?" (Que Chou)</p>

<p>— Zhenghong</p>
<p>The origin of the name "road" is difficult to trace. In terms of its meaning, a road is actually a path for horses to travel on. But those who rub shoulders and come and go busily, are they people or horses? Considering the name, one can't help but smile wryly. In the past, the Zhou road was as smooth as a whetstone and as straight as an arrow. Today's road is as smooth and straight as the Zhou road. But it is not called a "main road" but a "horse road." Even scholars and officials are accustomed to calling it that and do not notice it. This is also strange. Some say that a road is named so because the road is flat and wide enough to accommodate the galloping of angry horses. The meaning of the name "road" lies in this.</p>
<p>During my leisure time, I often stroll on the road. I often see the road authorities prominently displaying alarming slogans: "The road is like a tiger's mouth. Pedestrians must not walk on it." I think to myself, since it is called a "road," it is appropriate that people should not walk on it. But why is it compared to a tiger's mouth? I am confused. In the past, people used to walk instead of riding in carriages. The roads they walked on were not as flat and wide as today's roads. But today, people live in an age of material civilization, yet they cannot walk on the flat and wide roads. How much regret do they have? Is it true that there are tigers and wolves in the way, making people sigh with the difficulty of walking? However, the world is rugged, and thorns are everywhere. Where is there not a tiger's mouth? Alas...</p>

<p>— Jiguan</p>
<p>Years ago, I studied in Beiping. During the summer vacation, I went with many friends to explore the scenery of Badaling. This place is connected to the Great Wall. Upon climbing it, I only saw the wind howling outside the fortress and the dust swirling. My heart was stirred. Stones are abundant in this area, often resembling the shapes of plants, trees, clouds, and smoke. My companions occasionally found some and regarded them as strange. I found one on the sand next to the wall, about half a foot in size. Upon closer inspection, it had pine branches on it, with several slender grasses nearby, as if carved. I placed it on my desk when I returned, but it was not considered strange. When I brought it south and showed it to my friend Mr. Cheng, Mr. Cheng said it was a fragment of the Great Wall's foundation stone. He knew its name from visiting the area north of the Kou Pass in the past. The stone had aged over the years and assimilated with the plants and trees. It could predict the weather. Its special characteristic was that whenever it was about to rain, the stone containing the branches and leaves would show a moist color. And when it was clear, the opposite would be true. Paying attention to testing it, I found that it matched. Therefore, I knew that the stone could also be treasured and used to predict the weather.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend, Mr. Gai, came from Dakou and gave me two stones in the shape of a square obstacle. I was surprised by the gift. Mr. Gai said that these stones came from Dakou and were rarely seen elsewhere. Because the swallows of the south fly across the Dakou River, and the chicks they hatch often fall to the bottom of the water. Over the years, they combine with the mud and soil, forming stones transformed from swallows. Local people dig on both sides of the river and often find them. Over the years, foreigners have come here to collect them. Those with a clear and elegant appearance are carved into squares and circles and decorated with frames, regarded as good products for embellishing studies and painting halls. However, those with vivid and picturesque scenes have been rare in recent years. These two stones each have traces of algae and duckweed, interspersed with small swallows, soaring and flying, with many different postures. They are naturally made, and so strange. One can't help but sigh at the craftsmanship of the creator. Our country is vast and rich in resources. The strangeness of stones is not limited to this. I only recorded what I collected to show a glimpse of it.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor of Free Talk: I recently read a letter from WUB in your publication stating that the Cao Chef column in our newspaper's eighth volume, issue twenty-five supplement, was a reprint of UB's "Gossip from the Political Sea." The editor of this newspaper should be fully responsible for this matter. After investigation, the manuscript was submitted by "Luyang Kan Shang Sanren," whose real name is Yang Weibei, currently residing at No. 4, Miaojin Lane, Yangzhou. The editor of this newspaper has a limited understanding and failed to remember BU's great work, hence this small mistake. Now, he has been deceived of a "Guowen Weekly." Plagiarism of other people's work is an immoral act, and the responsibility lies where it belongs. Respectfully request that you disclose this to clarify the truth.

<h3 id="e105">Memories of Escaping the Summer Heat at West Lake <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Rongfang</p>
<p>Bai Juyi wrote in his poem, "Unable to bear to leave Hangzhou, half of my lingering is for this lake." I have been living in Wulin for ten springs and autumns, but I have been bound by my work in the telecommunications business and have not had the leisure to fully enjoy the beauty of the lake and mountains, to emulate Bai Fu's leisurely wandering, poetry, wine, and laughter. It is not appropriate to compare them on the same day. Last summer, I painfully experienced the suffering of illness and felt that the scenery of the lake and mountains was full of sadness, so desolate that I could not bear to stay. This spring, I traveled to Shanghai, where the city was filled with bright lights and bustling crowds. The jade flutes and pearl hairpins were extremely prosperous and luxurious, just like the golden powder of the Southern Dynasties. But now, under the scorching sun, I feel tired and weary. I yearn for a cool place to spend half a day, hoping to refresh my mind. But I can't find one. Looking back at the beauty of the Six Bridges and the Three Temples, I am even more haunted by Li Bai's dream of Tianmu Mountain.</p>
<p>When the summer heat arrives, the people of Hangzhou always take pleasure in living in the mountains. Most of them stay in the monks' dormitories. At this time, the large temples on the lake, such as Lingyin, Tianzhu, Jingci, Yuquan, and Fenglin, are all full of guests. The other smaller temples are also filled with students. The climate in the mountains is cool, the temples are clean, the vegetarian dishes are exquisite, and the flowers, trees, and meditation rooms are suitable for escaping the summer heat.</p>
<p>Every summer, I would wake up between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM. After washing up, I would go out of Hou Chao Gate in the waning moon and remaining stars. I would cross Wansong Ridge and arrive at the lake. The morning air and breeze in the mountains would bring a new coolness. The dew on the pine and willow trees would be dense, resembling pearls on my sleeves. The intermittent sounds of bells would echo each other. Sometimes I would go to Jingci Temple to watch the monks perform their morning prayers. The ancient Buddha, green lamps, red fish, and palm leaves created a peaceful and otherworldly atmosphere. Sometimes I would go to Su Causeway to watch the dawn. I would stroll on the Six Bridges. When it was sunny, thousands of rays of sunlight would shoot onto the blue waves, shining with gold and jade. When it was cloudy, the smoke and fog would cover the lake, and the clouds and mountains would appear and disappear, resembling Mi Fu's paintings. The wonderful scenery would change in an instant. Standing and staring, I would feel dizzy and entranced. Even if Wang Wei were resurrected, he would not be able to capture its beauty. When I had enough fun, I would either follow the shade of the willows along Su Causeway to Qiying or buy a small boat and enter Qingbo Gate to return. I would usually be back between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, the West Lake in June is different from the four seasons. The boundless green lotus leaves connect to the sky, and the lotus flowers reflected in the sun are especially red." This is a poem by a Song dynasty poet. It shows the value of West Lake in the summer during the Song dynasty. Now, times have changed, and the lotus leaves on the lake are no longer as prosperous as they used to be. When I first arrived in Hangzhou, there were still many plantings in the Houhu and Gushan areas. Whenever I had free time, I would often row a small boat through the Jin Dai Bridge in the faint morning light. I would row through the flowers. Even if the boat was not tied, there was no worry of being blown away. The golden light was everywhere, and the fragrance filled the lake. At that time, I would recite Cheng Zhai's poem "Early Morning Chant" and listen to the song of the lotus-picking girls of Yue. I would feel relaxed and carefree.</p>

<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>Mr. Lu couldn't refuse any longer. Although he felt it wasn't appropriate to go to Suzhou, he thought it wouldn't be so coincidental that his family would see him. Besides, this was the best opportunity to make further advances with Miss Ding. So, he no longer objected and even hoped to leave sooner.</p>
<p>"So, when are we going?" he asked.</p>
<p>"We'll go tomorrow. We can play for two days," the young lady said.</p>
<p>After talking for a while, Miss Ding had to go home. Mr. Lu escorted her all the way to her house. They agreed to depart together from her home on the 5:05 PM express train the next day.</p>
<p>Reluctantly parting, Mr. Lu didn't feel like going back to the school dorm, so he stayed overnight at a hotel.</p>
<p>When Miss Ding returned home, her mother was still awake. Qiuzi had already told her everything she had seen, describing Mr. Lu as a beautiful fairy in a fairy tale and the scene in the reception room as a story of golden boys and jade girls. Mrs. Ding was very happy and wanted to wait for her daughter to come back and ask her about it in detail.</p>
<p>"Where have you been? Who did you go with?" Mrs. Ding asked her daughter with a mysterious smile.</p>
<p>"Mom! I was just about to tell you! Mom! Look, this ring was given to me by one of my classmates." She said shyly and haltingly.</p>
<p>"In today's world, old people like us really don't understand anything anymore. Unlike when we were young, such a thing would at least take a month or two, arranging a meeting, matching horoscopes, sending gifts. How can it be so easy now?" Mrs. Ding said, peering at the diamond ring on her daughter's hand, while smiling slightly.</p>
<p>Miss Ding was very shy and had nothing else to say, only silently fiddling with her belt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ding continued, "So, what kind of person is that Mr. Lu?"</p>
<p>Miss Ding didn't say a word. She found it difficult to answer. Qiuzi, standing beside her, said with a smile, "Madam! That Mr. Lu and Miss are a match made in heaven!"</p>
<p>"What does his family do?" Mrs. Ding continued to ask.</p>
<p>"His father is a country gentleman from Suzhou. He owns a lot of land and property," Miss Ding replied softly.</p>
<p>"Good! Originally, this is your own business. If you are happy, that's all that matters. I only have one daughter like you. You can make all the decisions yourself!" Mrs. Ding smiled kindly.</p>
<p>It was very late, and Mrs. Ding went to bed. Miss Ding pretended to blame Qiuzi for being talkative, but in her heart, she felt much more comforted.</p>
<p>The night passed in sweet dreams. She felt a taste lingering in her heart that she had never experienced before. Even when she woke up, it seemed that a lingering passion was shaking her soul forever.</p>
<p>She got up and instructed Qiuzi to pack a few clothes and some toiletries in a small suitcase. She herself went to her mother and told her that she was going to Suzhou to play for two days.</p>
<p>Her mother loved her very much and naturally let her make her own decisions. She only instructed her, "Be careful on the road and come back after two days!"</p>
<p>From nine in the morning to four in the afternoon, Miss Ding felt that time was passing excessively slowly. It was not until Mr. Lu arrived that they went to the station together. They both had their own joy.</p>

<p>Shorts Aggressively Cover</p>
<p>Longs Add Positions</p>
<p>Continued Rise of Nine Taels in Value Yesterday, the 7th, the gold market continued to show a sharp and rapid rise in value, but the situation was peaceful. The overall market had a review of more than ten taels, mainly due to the nearly ten taels increase. The industry's demand for supply was very different. However, in general, shorts aggressively covered their positions, and many longs added positions. As for the silver market, it was reported to have opened lower and then rose. After opening high, it first softened, then strengthened, with fluctuations of only two or three taels. The foreign exchange market was stable. Afterwards, the market turned from stable to strong, with strong buying sentiment. Merchants covered their positions, mainly due to the expensive exchange rates. The industry competed to short-cover, and the market moved forward bravely, quickly breaking through the 750 tael mark, with a feeling of soaring high. In short, the recent active movement of cash stimulated the market, and this morning, the large bars still have the ability to fall.</p>
<p>Silver Price Opens Lower and then Rises The September opening was 744 taels and 8 mace, an increase of one tael. Large bars fell by one-sixteenth, and the silver price shrank by three-eighths. Private telegrams also fell by five-sixteenths, but there were still few buyers. Then, Cuichangyong, Juchang, Hengyu and others bought in, continuing for five and a half taels. Soon, Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang and others all sold off and went downstream, only totaling 43 taels, 2 mace and 3 candareens. As for English gold, the opening was unchanged. Retail sellers also lowered the price to 42 taels and 7 mace, then rose. Banks ate October English gold at 18.75, and September Japanese gold at 1 tael, 6 mace, 1 fen, 3 li, 1 hao, 2 si and 5 hu. Therefore, the gold price after 10 o'clock was outside of 43 taels. Dedesheng, Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, Changshengyong, Shenkang and others all came to buy. Then, it increased by more than 2 taels. However, in between, there were only a few candareens up and down. At 11:30, it was 46 taels and 2 mace. Suddenly, it retreated by one tael because Shunli, Wanxing, Hengyu and others sold. At 11:30, it was 45 taels, 1 mace and 2 candareens. Then, the bank did the October English gold for 1.25, and the Indian exchange rate reported a small anna. Only after 5 or 6 minutes, it increased to 5 taels and 8 mace. However, the Dalian gang and others still sold, and the English gold for 1.25 could be settled. Therefore, the closing price at noon was 45 taels and 3 mace. Retail customers came to buy, and it was raised again to 46 taels. The listed price was still 791 taels and 4 mace, equivalent to pressing 48 or 49 taels to 45 or 46 taels.</p>
<p>Breaks Through the 50 Tael Mark The after-market opened at 45 taels and 2 mace, then 5 taels. Then, Shunli and others sold first. However, Dedesheng and others still had a strong buying intention and immediately increased it to 6 taels and 5 mace. Then, it retreated by one tael. At 2:15, the later buyers showed strength. Xiexingyong, Tongchang, Yuda, Fuxingshui, Yuanxingyong and others followed in succession. Mitsui ate Dalian at 1 tael, 6 mace, 1 fen and 7.5 li. At 2:45, it was 48 taels, 3 mace and 4 candareens. But Yuanmao and others sold off, causing the price to drop to 7 taels and 4 or 5 candareens. Before long, it increased to 8 taels and 5 mace. Yuanmao and others covered their positions. Also, the English gold for September-October could be settled at 0.625. The Indian exchange rate telegram still had no good news. At 3:30, it was 40 taels and a half. After that, Mitsui ate September Dalian at 1 tael, 6 mace, 2 fen and 1.25 li. Merchandise on the counter, Yuanmao, Dedesheng, Fuxingyong, and general shorts tended to compete for purchases. The price soared, and the shorts were hit hard, killing them and causing them to collapse completely, without looking back, soaring 6 or 7 taels, reaching 53 taels and a half at 4:20. And the near-term English gold only settled at 1.29375, and the far-term at three pence. Then, there was a slight reversal of about two taels. It was counted as 2 taels and 3 mace to 3 taels and 3 mace. At 4:30, the closing price was 52 taels and 8 mace, a continued rise of nine taels compared to the day before yesterday. According to the end-of-day, the highest price was 53 taels and a half, and the lowest price was 42 taels and 7 mace, a difference of 10 taels and 8 mace.</p>
<p>Bare Bar Trend Gets Smoother Merchandise morning market at 44 taels and 7 mace, noon close at 5 taels and 8 mace, afternoon at 5 taels and 6 mace, closing at 52 taels and 3 mace. The listed price is equivalent to pressing 45 or 46 taels to 38 or 39 taels. The dual settlement price for before and after the afternoon at the counter. From 743 taels at noon to 45 taels, the evening market was 51 taels to 53 taels, adding 43 taels, and the afternoon at 51 taels. Also, the spot bare bar actually increased by 13 taels and 5 mace. The various firms sold two or three thousand taels to Yingfenghang, and that firm sold five or six thousand taels to the Dalian and Fengtian gangs, so the trend was quite smooth.</p>
<p>Transactions Exceptionally Complex As for the transactions of each firm on the counter, it seems to be complex. According to statistics, Cuichangyong, Changshengyong, Qianchangxiang, Yuanxingyong, Futaiheng, Hongli, Dedesheng, and merchandise all advanced. Yuantai, Yuanchun, Yifengyong, Yongfeng, Hengyu, and Shenchangyong had inconsistent ins and outs. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Shunli, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yuda and others generally supplied more than they demanded. In the afternoon, Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, and Yuanmaoyong went out and advanced again. Yuandayong, Bingxing, Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Wu and others all went out. Yuantai, Shunli, Wanxing, and Hengyu occasionally had deliveries and withdrawals. Cuichangyong, Dedesheng, Hongxing, Tongfenghang, Futaiheng, Yuanxingyong, Xiexingyong, Fuxingyong and merchandise all took in, but the English gold hedging had sales. The Guangdong gang still had no ins and outs. The Dalian gang sold 1,400 bars and took in 1,000 bars.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Silver Dollar Market Ultimately Tending Towards Peacefulness <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: The sentiment in the silver dollar market currently seems unlikely to see significant improvement. According to the current state of the market, there is ample supply of both silver dollars and other similar currencies. Even if there is a small amount of sales, it has no impact on the overall situation. The current purchase of silver dollars in the Yangtze River region has not resulted in any significant change in the exchange rate, which indicates a certain stability. According to people in the trade, in addition to the demand for silver dollars in the Yangtze River, there is also demand in other ports. Despite this demand, the abundant existing supply continues to prevent any improvement in market sentiment.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate (Silver per Taels): The morning exchange rate was 7 taels, 2 mace, 5 candareens, 2 cash. The afternoon exchange rate was 7 taels, 2 mace, 5 candareens, 1 cash, 2.5 mil.

<h3 id="e114">Yarn and Cotton Market Trends Fluctuate <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The decline in the yarn market has slightly subsided. After a significant drop, it can temporarily stabilize. However, the overseas situation remains weak, and actual sales are sluggish. All areas show no signs of development. Therefore, major players remain calm and have no intention of making up for losses. However, some who have profited are covering short positions. In the afternoon, due to positive news in the gold market, market sentiment was relatively firm. However, the overall environment remains unfavorable because severe floods in various regions have had a significant impact. Currently, a brief period of small fluctuations may be possible.</p>
<p>Individual Bidders Cover Short Positions: At the exchange, the opening market for individual bids was influenced by the continued weakness of American cotton, and market sentiment remained soft. However, those who had profited covered short positions, resulting in slight increases of three or four qian across various months. Second and third positions fell sharply. As a result, nearby positions rose by one or two qian, while distant positions fell by one qian. The afternoon opening market remained weak. Second and third positions were driven by rising raw cotton prices, causing individual investors to cover short positions, and all months increased by one to three or eight qian. A total of 44,200 bales were traded. Sold: Gongtai 1,100 bales, Taichang 900 bales, Xinhua 1,900 bales, Xincheng 750 bales, Rongxing 700 bales. Bought: Hengde 1,900 bales, Shenji 700 bales, Yichang 650 bales, Xingyuan 1,650 bales, Rongxing 600 bales. The closing prices for individual bids are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Individual Bid Closing Prices, Changes, and Open Interest: Closing Price: Change: Open Interest</p>
<p>August: 159.0: …: 58,050; November: 157.5: …: 90,600</p>
<p>September: 156.1: Up 2: 94,490; October: 158.5: Up 2: 78,900</p>
<p>October: 157.0: 1: 92,900; January: 159.2: 8: 36,150</p>
<p>Spot Sales Show No Improvement: Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Total daily purchases by various guilds are estimated at 655 bales. Eight bales were exchanged among fellow traders, with stable prices. Merchants from inland areas purchased 95 bales from Yunnan, 140 bales from Changsha, 95 bales from Qinhuangdao, 75 bales from the Northern Guild, 60 bales from the Miscellaneous Guild, and 120 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Cotton Market Experiences a Large Drop, Followed by a Small Rebound <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market decline has stabilized slightly. The continuous days of sharp declines have prompted those with profits to cover short positions, and market sentiment has slightly firmed. However, the state of American cotton remains weak, and the 8-fen mark for spot goods has already been broken. However, people in this city, due to the hot weather, are deeply afraid of a brewing storm. In the afternoon, gold prices rose slightly, and many believe there will be further increases. If the gold market rises, the import price of foreign cotton will be high, so retail investors are covering short positions, and the market situation has turned upward. However, American cotton is still fundamentally pessimistic.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Rebounds with Gold Market: At the exchange, the opening market for Hankou cotton was affected by a slight decline in American cotton of several pounds, resulting in stable sentiment. There was a lack of sellers, and each month rose by 2 to 3 qian. Second and third positions fell again. As a result, the increase was 5 fen to 1.5 qian. In the afternoon, flower tenders rose slightly due to the rise in gold prices, rising by 1.5 to 2 qian. 91,000 dan were traded. Sold: Minghua 2,500 dan, Gengfeng 2,500 dan, Xinhua 4,400 dan, Deji 2,400 dan, Jinfeng 2,800 dan, Changfeng 1,300 dan. Bought: Yuanfeng 3,400 dan, Xingyuan 2,700 dan, Mingde 2,000 dan, Taixing 3,300 dan, Tongyu 2,100 dan. The closing prices for Hankou cotton are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>October: 3590: 25: 186,900; January: 3590: 30: 102,200</p>
<p>Spot Sales Continue to Stagnate: Spot cotton trading is very quiet. It is estimated that 1,600 bales of Yao cotton were traded.</p>

<p>American Cotton Continues to Fall, Indian and British Cotton Rebound: Yesterday, American cotton initially firmed due to good news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to estimates of favorable cotton harvests and good weather, with futures falling 2 to 5 pounds and spot goods falling 5 pounds. British cotton futures rose 3 points, and spot goods rose 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose 5 points. Indian cotton firmed due to better Liverpool market prices, with Pingguoer rising 2.75 rupees, Aomula rising 2.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rising 2 rupees.

<p>Thick Medium-Grain Rice Is Again Being Stored on the Docks</p>
<p>And There Are Private Exports</p>
<p>South Market: The source of supply from various guilds is around the 12th to 14th. Due to scarce sales and movement from urban and rural shops, foreign rice has soared in price. In addition, Dongxin Medium-Grain Rice has increased by another half yuan and is also in short supply among the customers, which makes people feel more upward, and the intention to import is quite strong. Thick Medium-Grain Rice is slightly stored on the docks, and the situation is rapidly increasing by half yuan. Thin early rice is scarce, sales are very active, and the price has increased by three or four jiao. Foreign Lu Rice is high, short, and in demand, sharply increasing by three jiao. Zhongguan Rice sales are..., Yin Yuan Rice inventory is sporadic, and the exchange to Silver Yuan is difficult, sales are quite active, and the market is also tight. Foreign rice from Hankou guilds continues to be purchased, but the dock inventory is weak, and the market is increasing daily.</p>
<p>New Gate: Yesterday, a dozen or so supplies came from inland areas, and transactions on this street became more active. Each shop is taking advantage of this opportunity to add to its inventory, and people's hearts are tightening. A telegram from the West Road reported that the market for coarse medium-grain rice is upward, but this city is affected by it. It is learned that there are private exports, 500 shi of Changxi top medium-grain rice, and the price has risen by four or five jiao. Qingjiao thin early rice and Fenglian goods have each increased by five jiao. Lubu fine rice and foreign fine rice are purchased by customers, and the meager inventory is swept away, and the price has also increased by two jiao. There is a shortage of Yin Yuan Rice, and the price is tight.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Flour Market Enters a Stable Path <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally presented a stable path. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat fell again by two jiao, and Chicago fell to four jiao and seven fen, creating a record low not seen abroad, the domestic floods are also an unprecedented disaster, and the sound of disaster has stirred the ears and eyes of the whole country. Therefore, although factories are actively booking foreign wheat to maintain their future production, the Yangtze River guilds are also taking advantage of market to offset the losses of the floods. Therefore, this movement out and back in has created the conditions for a more stable market, otherwise the buyers and sellers would not be able to carry out their trades, and the market would not be so stable. Looking at the future, we should look at the real sales situation to see which way it goes. As a result, this month is 7.5 li better than the previous day, September is 5 li better, October/November is 1 fen better, December is 7.5 li better, and January is 5 li better.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai filature silk market was silent. It was learned that Shandong Yellow Filature Silk this year has a poor cocoon production and the silk itself is not loose. Although there were negotiations in the market yesterday, Shandong silk merchants asked for 900 taels for their silk in hand, but the French buyers felt the price was too high and there were no transactions. American sales are still stagnant. Yesterday, only Weicheng Company bought 5 bales of Huaihu White Filature Silk, and Boxing bought 10 bales of Yellow Filature Silk, and the price remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Lüzhuang Green Tea is Firm <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai filature tea market saw strong interest from British and French buyers for Lüzhuang zhenmei, xiaomei, big-leaf fengmei, and xiumei green teas, as well as white-tipped teas. Fine zhenmei teas were particularly popular. Tea merchants, seeing that the market inventory was low and the supply exhausted, asked for higher prices, and the green tea market has reached a stable level. Qimen black tea saw slight interest from Yihua and Xintai yesterday, but because the market had been stagnant for a long time, the selling price was seen to fall by more than ten taels.</p>

<p>There have been no deliveries of Xiamen candied tangerines in the previous two rounds, and the market inventory is low. It was learned that only 20 barrels were transported on the Huizhou ship, and the quoted price in the letter has risen, so the price on the market is tight again. Given the scarcity of supply, the asking price is bound to rise again, with an expected increase of about 8 qian, as Xiamen candied tangerine dough is soft and extremely suitable for customer needs.</p>

<p>Jiang Zuobin to Assume Post in Japan Soon</p>
<p>Representatives to the League of Nations to be Selected Separately</p>
<p>Report on the Korean Incident to be Released Soon</p>
<p>Chen Youren to Return Home Soon</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai to Mourn the Death of Madame Sun Yat-sen</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting arrived in Shanghai by express train from Beijing at 11 o'clock last night. This newspaper’s reporter interviewed him in the train. According to Foreign Minister Wang, the newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, will assume his post in Japan in the shortest possible time. Because it is a tense period in Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the Ambassador to Japan has extremely important responsibilities and cannot delay for too long. As for the representatives to attend the League of Nations meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will select other personnel and submit them to the National Government for appointment. The League of Nations meeting will open on September 7th, and it is feared that it will not be possible to rush there from the country, so it has been decided that the ambassador stationed abroad will serve concurrently. The candidates have not yet been decided. Ambassador Wang Rongbao has already met with him in Beijing. I have also read the written report of the Korean Incident investigation. I am instructing the department to organize it, and after it is organized, it will be published in the newspapers. The investigation report is a matter of fact and there is no need for secrecy. I came to Shanghai to mourn the death of Madame Sun Yat-sen. I am scheduled to pay my respects tomorrow (ie today). I will return to Beijing on Monday. As for the rumors that I will meet with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi in Shanghai tomorrow morning (ie today), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not make an appointment in advance. It is also unknown whether he will come to meet me temporarily. The reporter finally asked about Chen Youren's actions in Japan. What is the truth? Wang replied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had repeatedly received reports on Chen's mission to Japan, and the Japanese government also sent a statement to the Ministry. Chen knew very well that he could not do anything in Japan, and he will definitely return to China in the next day or two.</p>

<p>Request a Thorough Investigation</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Theory of Extending the Concession <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Unanimous Demand from All Circles in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>In the Puxong District of Western Shanghai, in areas such as Zhoujiaqiao, there were people posing as representatives of merchants and civilians who requested the Municipal Council to extend the concession, which has been detailed in previous reports. It is now learned that Gu Hongjun and Chen Zhenbai, citizens of Zhoujiaqiao in the district, and others have jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Committee, which will be forwarded to the Municipal Government, for a strict investigation. It is also learned that Chen Yafu, the Municipal Committee member of the district, immediately went to Zhoujiaqiao, Wangjialou, Chengjiaqiao and other places to conduct door-to-door investigations after reading the Da Mei Evening News the day before. According to the merchants and civilians in the area, there is indeed no such outrageous and traitorous act of willingly selling out the country. However, there is a reason for everything. The committee member has already obtained some clues and submitted them to the Municipal Government for strict investigation, and also requested that the truth be clarified to the Municipal Council. It is believed that the truth will not be difficult to reveal. The text of the submission is recorded below:</p>
<p>Submission from the Municipal Committee of Puxong District: Submitting a report on the matter of posing as a representative to request the Municipal Council to extend the concession, requesting review and thorough investigation based on the situation, and requesting clarification of the truth to the Municipal Council. According to the report from Gu Hongjun and other citizens of Zhoujiaqiao in the district, recently, the newspapers have reprinted reports saying, "200,000 merchants and civilians in Western Shanghai have jointly requested the Municipal Council to extend the concession, and purchase land to build police stations and collect police donations from shops, residents and factories along the roads, etc." After reading it, they were shocked. The citizens of Western Shanghai have always abided by their duties, and their patriotic concepts have never fallen behind others. In the past, due to the various relations of building roads beyond the boundary, they have been oppressed by imperialists for a long time, and they have endured it in silence for more than a day. Now, in the midst of the movement to recover the concession, unexpectedly, there is the absurd and outrageous thing of the so-called 200,000 merchants and civilians in Western Shanghai jointly requesting the Municipal Council to extend the concession. Moreover, it is not known who the 200,000 people are, and what qualifications they have to represent the name of the 200,000 people in Western Shanghai, so that the 200,000 people are all charged with the notoriety of selling out the country. And what methods did the Municipal Council use to obtain the written request of 200,000 people? For the sake of China's national rights and the future of the 200,000 citizens of Western Shanghai, we absolutely cannot recognize this kind of flattery of foreigners, profit-seeking, power-losing and country-humiliating behavior. Therefore, we specially submit a report to the committee for review, and request the Municipal Government to send a committee to conduct a strict investigation as soon as possible. What kind of treacherous slaves dare to pose as 200,000 merchants and civilians in Western Shanghai and commit this act of selling out the country? And ask the Municipal Council where the so-called written request of 200,000 people came from, and strictly arrest the national traitors who pose as traitors, and strictly investigate them to rectify the national law and eliminate the foreigners' ambitions to covet and attempt. The 200,000 citizens of Western Shanghai have been unjustly humiliated, or they can be exonerated. The situation is extremely urgent. According to this, after learning about the Da Mei Evening News, I immediately went to Zhoujiaqiao, Wangjialou, Chengjiaqiao and other places to conduct door-to-door investigations. They all said that in this season of singing loudly about recovering the concession, our merchants and civilians would never dare to do anything against their conscience unless they were insane. The report in the newspaper that the citizens requested the Municipal Council to extend the concession is completely fabricated. It is found that this act of posing as a representative and doing something outrageous is caused by treacherous people and local bullies causing trouble in order to flatter foreigners, or it is a groundless rumor created by the Municipal Council. According to the previous situation, it is reasonable to submit a report to your office for review and prompt investigation, and request that the Municipal Council clarify the truth to punish those who pose as representatives and extend the true public opinion. It is for the public good. Sincerely submit (omitted below)</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Caojiadu Citizens' Association In Western Shanghai, the Third Branch of the Caojiadu Citizens' Association convened an emergency meeting at 8 pm the day before yesterday. More than 20 executive and standing committee members including Yao Yuguan, Chen Yunquan, Yu Yuqing, Zhu Rongping, Zhou Shangen, Zhu Heyun, Jin Fuchun, Li Meiqing, and Zhu Zhixian attended the meeting. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying briefly, "On the 5th of this month, newspapers in this city reprinted the Da Mei Evening News's publication of 200,000 merchants and civilians in Zhoujiaqiao and other places in Western Shanghai jointly requesting the Public Concession Municipal Council to extend the Western Shanghai Concession. After reading it, we were deeply horrified. This area is adjacent to Zhoujiaqiao and other places, and we have never heard of it before. We are afraid that there may be misunderstandings from various parties, so we should urgently clarify the facts. Since the development of the market in this area over the years, the fire brigade was the first to be established, in the ninth year of the Republic of China. In the twelfth year, the Merchants and Civilians Association was established, and then the Defense Corps was established. This year, the association was reorganized. In the middle, due to the water relationship in the fire, conflicts have occurred with the concession many times. Members of the Defense Corps passed through the road and also negotiated with the Municipal Council before they were able to pass unobstructed. The addition of six district police stations, the expansion of posts, the recovery of police power, and the recovery of cleaning and hygiene, etc., are even more obvious to everyone. Moreover, for other matters involving national sovereignty and vital interests, we have assisted and requested the authorities to do their best to fight for them without any retreat. It can be seen that the patriotic enthusiasm of the citizens in this area has always been second to none. However, some people are willing to be accomplices and are still afraid that foreigners will not know how to progress, and even request the extension of the concession. Such flattery of foreigners, seeking personal gain, losing power and humiliating the country, and the ghostly tricks of shameless faces openly appear under the clear sky and bright sun. Isn't this a strange thing? The citizens of this area are a part of Western Shanghai, and they have sympathy for their anger. Moreover, the establishment of this association was originally to assist the party and government authorities to actively recover the roads built beyond the boundary and abolish unequal treaties. Therefore, we should investigate the truth, how to proceed with handling, please discuss and vote." After the committee members discussed for a long time and expressed their opinions one after another, it was decided to submit a report to the party and government organs and the Citizens' Association, requesting a strict investigation of the outrageous and falsely requested representatives, and requesting the Municipal Council to clarify the origin of the letter, and requesting the Municipal Government to quickly install water and electricity and repair the road surface on the roads built beyond the boundary in preparation for actively recovering the roads built beyond the boundary. The meeting was adjourned and the bell rang eleven times.</p>
<p>The 10th District Party Department Requests a Thorough Investigation The 10th District Party Department submitted a report to the Municipal Party Department yesterday regarding the reports in the newspapers that 200,000 people in Western Shanghai jointly requested the Municipal Council to extend the concession, requesting a thorough investigation. The exploration report is recorded below: Submitting a report for the matter of submission. Since the Da Mei Evening News disclosed the news that merchants and civilians in Western Shanghai requested the Municipal Council to extend the concession, all nationals have believed it to be true, and they have been angry and fearful, saying that the sovereignty of Western Shanghai is about to be lost. It is found that Zhoujiaqiao, Wangjialou, Chengjiaqiao and other places in Western Shanghai are within the scope of the headquarters of this district. They are all small town markets. If there are treacherous merchants living there and committing this act of selling out the country and flattering foreigners, the comrades of this association hate it even more. Since receiving the news, the committee members have been going to the places to inquire and investigate in detail. For example, in Zhoujiaqiao, there are Xinmin and Minsheng textile mills, which have become prosperous. Wangjialou has only a dozen small shops, and Chengjiaqiao has only seven or eight. After investigating each household and inquiring about the main partners, they all said that in recent years, the national spirit of our people has gradually increased, and the government is actively recovering the concession and the roads built beyond the boundary. The people should do their best to support the government. Although we were born in the market, we still know the great righteousness. How can we be insane and be accomplices and sell out the country for glory? According to yesterday's newspapers, one of the merchants' expressions has been ordered, which shows that there are no merchants in Western Shanghai who dare to commit this outrageous act. However, there must be a reason for the occurrence of an event. Although there is no such person among the merchants and civilians in Western Shanghai, there must be a reason for everything. There must be a reason for the generation of the driving force, and we should try to explore and find out the bottom line so that we can understand its content and plan for prevention and resistance. In the opinion of the comrades of this association, the reason is nothing more than two points: one is the behavior of local bullies, and the other is the coveting of foreigners. In the psychology of the bullies, they originally relied on the power of foreign merchants to sell the country to foreigners in order to make multiple profits. Now they see that the concession has become extremely developed and the land has become a fixed property for the industry owners. There are not many years to sell in and out, and there are fewer opportunities for them to make profits. Therefore, they have a whimsical idea and are willing to be accomplices and make this request to extend the concession in order to flatter the psychology of foreigners. If it is successful, they can follow it to return to their desire to make profits, and in a blink of an eye, they will become rich enough to boast of their assets. Even if it is not successful, it will not hurt them, or it can make foreigners happy, know their surnames, and then they can conspire and collude to sell the country and harm the people in order to fulfill their ambitions. There is no one more poisonous than this in the hearts of the scum of the country. Their coveting for foreigners is that at this time when our country is united to recover the concession and the campaign is the most intense, they are afraid that the truth will be difficult to hide and prevent the achievement of our country's recovery goal, so they borrow the mouths of merchants and civilians to conduct this counter-propaganda behavior in order to shake international hearing and create obstacles for our revenue. To maintain its concession life, its aggressive ambitions are fixed. Under this exaggerated atmosphere of rumors and extending the concession, we should first investigate whether there are any bullies who have requested, and the Municipal Council has made a large propaganda in the Da Mei Evening News, and its words must be based on something. We should request our government to make serious representations to it to clarify the truth. If the bullies really have such behavior, then quickly arrest them and bring them to justice to thank the people of the country. If it is caused by foreigners coveting, then we must pay attention to prevention, uphold justice, and publicize their aggressive ambitions to friendly countries, and actively carry out our work to achieve the goal of recovering the concession as soon as possible and restoring our sovereignty. We should ask the government and the people to work together to make a special report on the situation after the investigation to your association for review, one to express the feelings of the merchants and civilians in Western Shanghai, and one to request a thorough investigation of the origin of this statement, and to suspend the request for active handling to clarify the truth. The comrades of this association will do their best to follow behind to recover the concession. The country is fortunate. Sincerely submit. The association also received a report from more than 50 businesses including Liyuan in Zhoujiaqiao and more than 20 merchants and civilians including Gu Hongjun and Chen Zhen et al., requesting the transfer of the report to the Municipal Party Department, which has been transferred accordingly.</p>
<p>Serious Expression of the Citizens' Federation The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation telegraphed the National Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, and the Shanghai Municipal Government for the recovery of the boundary-crossing roads that hinder sovereignty. The original Shanghai Public Concession was originally demarcated, but it was promoted due to the failure of the Qing Dynasty and the military阀 in power. The expansion of its scope is very different from the original boundary. The citizens of Shanghai deeply hate the foreigners' perversion and all attempt to recover it to rectify the national territory. However, due to the many events in the country and the environmental obstacles, it has not been successful. However, this aspiration has never been disregarded and we have always thought of freedom. Unexpectedly, foreigners' ambitions have not died and they have cleverly created rumors, wanting to promote it again. Its absurdity is ridiculous and hateful. It is found that the west of the Public Concession is limited to Jing'an Temple, but over the years, the Municipal Council has built roads beyond the boundary, advancing westward from the west end of Jing'an Temple, past Beixinjing and westward, naming its roads Yuyuan Road, Daxilu, Hualun Road, Lincoln Road, McLaughlen Road, Luobiegen Road, etc. No one who has a heart and has passed those roads can not be filled with anger. The association believes that at this time when negotiations to recover the concession have not yet matured, it is planned to first recover the roads built beyond the boundary, and immediately correct the names of the roads to rectify national rights and follow public opinion. I respectfully telegraph to you, please review and implement it. Yours sincerely, Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation.</p>

<p>The Remnants of the Shi Bandit and Red Bandits Have Been Almost Completely Annihilated</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Received a Telegram from Commander-in-Chief He Yesterday: Mayor Zhang, brother Yuejun, greetings, confidential: (1) As of the Eastern Day, our Second and Third Divisions have captured more than 40,000 officers and soldiers of the Shi Department, 5-6,000 mules and horses, and countless firearms. Except for a few cavalry led by the Shi Bandit who fled without a trace, most of them have been completely resolved by our various departments. (2) The remnants of the Red Bandits, after being fiercely pursued by our various departments, gathered near Xingbu to resist stubbornly. The troops under Zhao Guantao have already recovered Xingguo City on that day, and the various armies are pursuing and suppressing the remnants. It is expected that all the Red Bandits will be annihilated within a few days. Yingqin.</p>

In just a few days, they have recovered Ningdu and Donggu. The good news has been spread, and we are all cheering and applauding. Saving the country and saving the people is admired by the whole country. We hope that the evil will be eradicated and the bandit dens will be pacified. Then, on the day of the triumph, we will lead the people to greet you with food and drinks. We hereby send our congratulations and condolences.

<h3 id="e148">Record of the Anti-Japanese Propaganda Conference <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>More Than 1,000 People Attended the Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Various Circles Anti-Japanese and Aid Overseas Chinese Committee held its first (Nanshi) Propaganda Conference at the Xiaoximen Juvenile Propaganda Group last night. About 1,000 people from all walks of life attended the meeting. Because the venue was small, it could not accommodate more people, so more than 100 people were restricted outside, which shows the people's indignation towards Japan. The grand occasion is recorded below:</p>
<p>Overview of the Venue Along the Zhonghua Road entrance, there were signs with the words "Shanghai Various Circles Anti-Japanese and Aid Overseas Chinese Propaganda Conference". The venue was full of slogans. The 250th Regiment of the Boy Scouts (East Asia Sports College) was in charge of discipline. The 65th Regiment (Business Union) played military music. There was a signing place at the entrance, and the Sino-French Pharmacy donated Rendan. The Nanyang Tobacco Company and Huacheng Tobacco Company donated cigarettes. Jiufutang donated paper fans, which showed their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Conference Staff Chairman Xu Yefu, Recorder Hu Shuguang, Master of Ceremonies Song An, Reception Yao Ying, Guan Huaicong, Li Ruiying, Yu Zhongbiao, Affairs Tao Chengzhang, Zhou Xueying, Xu Huimin, Lv Zhongyuan.</p>
<p>Order of the Meeting (1) Opening of the meeting, (2) Singing the party song, (3) Paying the highest respect to the party flag and the portrait of the Prime Minister, (4) Chairman respectfully reading the Prime Minister's will, (5) Chairman's report, (6) Special lecture (Mr. Pan Zhan Tao Baichuan), (7) Costume lecture (Three gentlemen of the costume lecture group of the Juvenile Propaganda Group, Wang Wu Neng, Jiang Xiaoxiao, and Zhao Xixi), (8) Shouting slogans, (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Special Lecture First, the chairman reported on the significance of the meeting, and then invited Mr. Pan Zhan to give a lecture. In addition to briefly reporting on the Japanese killing of Korean overseas Chinese, he briefly said, "The Chinese people's anti-Japanese movement is not once, but each anti-Japanese time, Japanese imperialism insults us more once. The reason for this is that the Chinese people have not been able to oppose Japan permanently. Now the government is not the same as Yuan Shikai's government in the fourth year of the Republic of China, but is doing it in accordance with the Prime Minister's will. However, in the end, there are too many troublemakers in the country, such as the Red Bandits in Jiangxi, the abnormal situation in Guangdong, and the rebellion of the Shi Bandit in the north, which are too chaotic, so that the Japanese have the opportunity to invade. The so-called things must rot by themselves and insects will be born. At the same time, because of this relationship, the government's diplomacy is also difficult. At this time, our people should automatically oppose Japan, that is, vow not to sell Japanese goods, rely on everyone's conscience, and permanently economically cut off relations with Japanese imperialism, and be the backing of the government. As for unnecessary and boring reckless actions, for the sake of prudence, it should be avoided." The listeners were all moved.</p>
<p>Costume Lecture First, Mr. Jiang Xiaoxiao and Zhao Xixi gave a lecture, which was extremely humorous and vigilant, and won a lot of applause. Then, the gentlemen of the costume lecture group of the Juvenile Propaganda Group gave a lecture on "Who is the enemy?" Mr. Yao Mingxin and Feng Danbai performed a cross-talk show, which was extremely precise and vigilant.</p>
<p>News from the Meeting This conference was held in the hot summer, and there were more than a thousand listeners, which made the downstairs of the venue very crowded and could not accommodate any more people. About two hundred people could not enter the venue. Fortunately, the Boy Scouts and police officers explained politely, and the order was still good. However, the association expressed its apologies. Also, the association will hold its second propaganda conference next Sunday, and has specially hired Mr. Chen Binhe, a famous expert on Japan, to give an academic lecture. The venue will be in the Youth Association.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Australian Aviator Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Solo Flight from Australia to England</p>
<p>Arrived Safely at Songkou and Landed Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Australian aviator Chi Qian Sde, driving a light plane, the "Ereca", flew from Taiwan to the Jiangmian River in Wusongkou at 4:20 pm yesterday and landed safely. He immediately added gasoline and was towed by a steamer to the Yangjinggang Jiangmian River opposite Yangshupu to stay overnight. Those who welcomed him on the Jianggan River were representatives of the British Royal Aviation Association and the Yinshike Association. Last night, the two groups held a banquet to welcome him. If the weather is good today, Mr. Chi Qian Sde will leave Shanghai at 7-8 am this morning and fly to Korea. Mr. Chi Qian Sde is a famous Australian aviator who looks very similar to Lenin. He once flew alone in the "Ereca" small plane to travel to England and Australia two years ago and achieved his flying goal in eighteen days. He is now still driving the original plane to make a solo flight from Australia via the Far East to London. He flew from Manila to Shanghai this Monday, first to the northernmost port of the Philippines, Cabali, and then to Taiwan. He originally hoped to arrive in Shanghai on Wednesday or Thursday, but later the plane landed in Taiwan and suffered minor damage, which led to the delay. He did not leave Taiwan until 9:45 am yesterday and flew 600 miles to Shanghai. After that, he will fly to Korea and Japan, then across the Pacific Ocean, across the Americas, and to London.</p>

<h3 id="e153">News of Flood Relief in Various Provinces <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Telegram Seeking Disaster Relief Funds: The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces held its inaugural meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce the night before last. Mr. Xu Jingren, Chairman of the Relief Committee, nominated Yu Hede, Wang Xiaolai, and Wang Zhen as temporary chairmen to jointly organize the association's affairs. Yesterday afternoon, Yu, Wang, and Wang invited Xu Jingren, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Wu Zhihao, and Zhang Gongquan (representing Jin Houcheng) for a public meeting. During the meeting, it was decided that the number of executive committee members would be unlimited, but there would be eleven standing committee members and three secretaries-general to jointly handle the association's affairs. Internal affairs would still be handled by Mr. Jin Guanfu of the Relief Committee, along with the original staff. It was also decided that the first standing committee meeting would be held at 4:00 PM today. Subsequently, it was decided to send a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, stating that the people's donations were limited and requesting that he quickly allocate 20 million yuan in cash to handle emergency relief in various provinces. The original telegram is recorded below: "To His Excellency Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanchang General Headquarters: Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous torrential rains have caused widespread flooding, affecting sixteen provinces and eighty million people. This unprecedented disaster has not been seen in a century. The Republic prioritizes the people's livelihood, but now tens of millions of flood victims are suffering from drowning and starvation, unable to guarantee their lives from morning till night. If we rely solely on the public to leisurely solicit donations, no matter how hard we try, the amount obtained will be limited and too slow to address the emergency. The dead are gone, and the living, especially the old and weak, will end up in ditches, while the strong will become bandits. Hede and others feel deeply concerned and dare to earnestly request Your Excellency, with a heart that feels the hunger and drowning of others as your own, to provide salvation and fulfill the government's duty. Immediately order the allocation of 20 million yuan in cash to expedite emergency relief in various provinces. This is an urgent plea, and we await your command with utmost trepidation. Respectfully, the Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces, Yu Hede, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhen, Xu Shiying, Zhang Zhijiang, Huang Qinglan, Li Jin, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Qin Runqing, bow in unison, Yang."</p>
<p>Relief Association Requests Funds: Mr. Xu Jingren, Chairman of the Relief Committee, is extremely concerned about the recent floods in various provinces. In addition to sending a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek requesting a large sum of money for relief, he has repeatedly appealed to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance for funds. The day before yesterday, Mr. Xu paid a special visit to Finance Minister Song Ziwen but was unable to meet him due to illness. Yesterday, he accompanied Mr. Wang Yiting, a member of the association's standing committee, to visit Mr. Zhang Yongni, the Deputy Minister of Finance. Mr. Zhang received them and promised to do his best to raise funds, informing them that Minister Song had agreed to first issue 2 million yuan in salt tax treasury bills, which could be collected on Tuesday of next week, to assist with emergency relief in various provinces. Once he recovers from his illness, he will return to the capital and submit disaster relief and rehabilitation measures to the State Council, issuing 20 million yuan in disaster relief bonds so that the major disasters in various provinces can be alleviated as much as possible. Mr. Xu and Mr. Wang expressed their deep gratitude to Mr. Song for his compassion and to Mr. Zhang for his enthusiasm on behalf of the flood victims. They also sent a telegram to the association in Nanjing, scheduling a relief meeting for the fourteenth to discuss emergency relief measures.</p>
<p>Jiangning Compatriots to Meet Tomorrow: The capital has been severely flooded this time, and the National Government has allocated funds to the Ministry of Interior to jointly establish an emergency relief association for the capital's flood, and expedites relief. However, the scope of the relief is limited to the capital city and its immediate suburbs, while the disaster-stricken area of the entire county is vast, making it difficult to reach everyone. Leng Jun, the Magistrate of Jiangning County, came to Shanghai on the fourth to discuss fundraising with prominent Jiangning figures such as Shi Liangcai, Sun Yuesan, Ha Shaofu, Xia Yizhai, Jin Guanfu, and Li Qin. However, this flood has affected not only Jiangning County but also all six counties formerly under Jiangning's jurisdiction. It is reported that the Jiangning Six Counties Association in Shanghai, the Jiangning Six Counties Public Office, and others will jointly launch the Jiangning Six Counties Flood Relief Association in Shanghai to raise relief funds. A notice has been issued inviting fellow villagers from the six counties to gather at the Jiangning Public Office on the ninth of this month to discuss the procedures.</p>
<p>Disaster Reports from Various Counties in Northern and Southern Anhui: The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association yesterday received subsequent reports from five counties: Fengtai, Yingshang, Dingyuan, Hefei, and Xuancheng, recorded below: (1) Fengtai County: This summer's harvest was poor, causing concerns about food shortages. Since May, the Huai, Ying, and Fei rivers have overflowed, with black sludge swirling and blocking the county seat. The water level is several feet higher than any recorded in the past three hundred years. The disaster is particularly severe compared to neighboring areas. All 500,000 people in the county have lost their homes and property, with no food or shelter. They are scattered and displaced, with cries echoing to the heavens. Even if they escape being eaten by fish, they can only endure starvation in the mountains. Some, worried about the future, tie their families together and drown. Those who escape have no way to climb trees for food. Fields and houses have been washed away, and livestock are lost. Only the sound of waves is heard, with no cooking smoke to be seen. Looking out from a high place, the sight is heartbreaking. The continuous rain and increasing flood season worsen the disaster, with no end in sight. If emergency relief is not provided, there will be widespread starvation. (2) Yingshang County: Situated near the Huai and Sha rivers, the terrain is low and prone to flooding. Last year's autumn rains flooded the crops on both banks of the Sha and Huai rivers, leaving the farmers in each area almost completely empty-handed. This year's spring floods caused the wheat to fail, with no means of sustenance and no way to borrow money. They had hoped for a good autumn harvest, but Heaven did not spare them, and floods followed. The dikes were breached, and the entire area became a vast expanse of water, covering over 300 li and turning into a swamp. People and livestock were swept away, and houses were washed away. Grain and firewood were lost in the waves. Over 370,000 mu of land in the county were flooded, and over 20,000 houses collapsed. Those not yet destroyed can be heard groaning in the water. The drowned and starved cannot be buried. The living have no place to stay and cannot guarantee their lives. Currently, one dou of rice costs 13 strings of cash, one dou of wheat costs 9 strings of cash, and one dou of mung beans costs 16 strings of cash. Grain and firewood are cut off, and the future is bleak. (3) Dingyuan County: Mountain floods erupted, with turbulent waves sweeping down like an avalanche. Houses collapsed and were carried away by the water. New and old coffins were washed up. Livestock and people drowned in large numbers. Those who managed to escape were emaciated and awaiting rescue. They were exposed to the wind and dew, and the fields were destroyed, making it difficult to expect an autumn harvest. What will they eat this winter and next spring? (4) Xuancheng County: From the Zhen to the Yan days of this month, there were continuous rains for ten days, and the floods spread hundreds of li, turning the entire area into a vast swamp. All 200-plus embankments in the county collapsed, with countless fields and houses washed away, and people and livestock drowned. The dead cannot be found, and the living cannot be saved. Hundreds of thousands of victims have no clothes or food. The disaster area is too large to navigate with even a small reed boat. The pitiful survivors will fill the ditches. (5) Hefei County: On the Geng day, mountain floods erupted, and the county seat became a swamp. All the embankments were breached, and the fields and houses were washed away, with countless people and livestock dying. Such a catastrophic disaster is rare in a century. (6) A part of the Shou County city wall was washed away some days ago, and the floodwater poured into the city, drowning many people and livestock. Telegraph poles were destroyed, causing delays in mail and making the news very bad. The Anhui Guangji Embankment covers 200 li and has a population of over 300,000, serving as the lifeline for the food supply of seven counties including Tonghuai. Thirty years after being repaired following a collapse in the twenty-seventh year of the Guangxu reign (Qing dynasty), it collapsed again at the Qianjiangkou on the You day of July, flooding hundreds of li. Fields and houses were submerged, and people and livestock drifted away. The farmers' livelihood for the entire year was ruined, leaving the victims in groups, with mournful cries echoing across the fields, causing distress and sorrow. Since the day of the disaster, the Anhui Charity Joint Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Charity Society have been distributing 60 million jin of dry food in shifts. However, there are too many victims and limited charitable funds. Therefore, they have requested assistance from government authorities and have sent representatives, Mr. Wang Duqi to Shanghai and Mr. Fu Shunsheng stationed in Shanghai, to appeal for donations from all parties on behalf of the victims. It is reported that there have been some results. Citizens Zhao Shaofu, Zhang Yunbo, Lu Gongren, Sun Huanchen, Zhu Shaoting, Liu Xihan, Deng Yuntai, Chen Junsheng, etc., of Fengyang County, presented a public letter to Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee, requesting the allocation of funds for relief, describing the terrible conditions of the flood disaster in their county. The letter stated: "We present this letter to request assistance for the hungry and drowning due to the unprecedented disaster caused by continuous heavy rain and the convergence of rivers. Since mid-June to the end of July, there has been continuous heavy rain in the Huai River region. The river water was already high, and the Yellow River took advantage of this continuous rain to shift south, drawing the Wo and Ying rivers west and converging with the Yi and Si rivers east, joining the Huai River simultaneously. This vast expanse covers over ten counties and exceeds 2,000 li. Based on surveys, the rainfall exceeds the average by more than 400%. Not only are the dikes completely broken, and half the population and livestock have not escaped, but most of the villages on the water have been wiped out. What is even more tragic is that people climb trees to be rescued, and countless corpses float on the waves every day. Such a catastrophe is causing sorrow for heaven and earth. The book says 'embracing the mountains and encircling the hills,' but this is even worse. We citizens grew up on the Huai River and have accurate knowledge of the situation. The floods are as described above. Fengyang is located in the middle of the Huai River. Every time there is a major flood, the four bays of Zhu, Wei, Tang, and Yao in the east reach Linhuai and converge with the Beng River, spanning 70 li in a straight line from east to west and 50 li across the north and south banks. The area of this year's flood is undoubtedly more than twice that. The disaster situation in the upper reaches is even more severe. The water in the northwest of the county connects, and the northeast mixes and flows with the Huai and Ling rivers, and the lower reaches with the Si River, creating a vast expanse of water. Seven of the ten districts in the county have been flooded. The water level in Honghu Lake is higher than the Huai River, and the Yangtze River is also rising, making it difficult to expect a smooth discharge. Currently, agricultural tools are floating, and crops are being swept away by the waves. Alas, the people are dying of starvation, and half are displaced. If this continues for two months, it will be even worse. Only 30% of the fields in the county have not been flooded. Even if there is a harvest, it will only be enough to feed a quarter of the county's population. If we do not receive assistance, these small people, without fields or food, will undoubtedly fill the ditches. At this time of desperation, we dare to hope for a glimmer of hope. Fortunately, gentry in each district are preparing for emergency relief and carrying out rescues, but the funds are scarce and the efforts are weak. The districts that have not been affected by the disaster have experienced continuous heavy rain, with walls collapsing, houses collapsing, and firewood and grain depleted. Most of these families have relatives and friends, and it is difficult to expect them to provide assistance at all times. We urgently need widespread relief to avoid the deaths of many. We have long admired Mr. Chairman for his concern for the people and his extreme admiration for Yu and Ji. We are willing to sincerely report the unusual disaster in Anhui and the disaster situation in Fengyang to your seat for review and approval, and we earnestly request a thorough investigation to allocate relief funds fairly. The merits of this will be immeasurable."</p>
<p>Sichuanese Request Disaster Relief Bonds: The Sichuanese Association in Shanghai and the Sichuanese Anti-Rehabilitation Bonds Appeal Group, etc., believe that the drought in Sichuan Province is extremely severe, and the floods have also affected the southern, eastern, and northern parts of Sichuan, with over one million famine victims. The Sichuan Provincial Government previously requested the Central Government to issue 1 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, but the Ministry of Finance replied that it would "temporarily postpone discussion" and failed to approve it. However, Liu Xiang's request to issue 20 million yuan in rehabilitation bonds was readily approved. It seems that the Central Government is not fully aware of the situation in Sichuan. They plan to jointly send a telegram to the Central Government, expressing their concern for the disaster in Sichuan, withdrawing the order to issue rehabilitation bonds to alleviate the people's suffering. If it is necessary to issue bonds, they request that they be transferred to disaster relief bonds to save the disaster victims. The telegram is being drafted and will be sent out soon.</p>
<p>Citywide Boy Scouts to Hold Large-Scale Fundraising: The No. 383 Guanghua High School Troop, the No. 121 Southeast Girls' Physical Education School Troop, the No. 196 Liangjiang Girls' Physical Education School Troop, and the No. 268 Fudan High School Troop of the Shanghai Boy Scouts, recognizing the unprecedented disaster of floods in various provinces, and witnessing the plight of compatriots in the disaster areas who are unable to live or die, and hearing their heart-wrenching cries, based on the Boy Scouts' principle of doing one good deed every day, and the spirit of helping others at all times and in all places, have proposed to the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council to quickly organize a citywide Boy Scouts fundraising disaster relief association. The original report of the four troops is recorded below: "Report Regarding Requesting Fundraising for Disaster Relief to Assist a Righteous Cause, Requesting Review and Implementation. Since the beginning of the year, there has been continuous rain, and mountain floods have erupted, causing floods in more than a dozen provinces, affecting no less than 50 million people nationwide. Such a catastrophe is rare in nearly a century. The dead are drifting away without a trace, and the living are displaced. The disaster is severe and heartbreaking. We, the Boy Scouts, embrace benevolence and courage, and make knowledge and action our nature. We should take responsibility for providing relief in this major disaster. Recognizing this, the troops have jointly requested that the Council organize a citywide Boy Scouts fundraising disaster relief association to gather donations widely, hoping to accumulate a little to make a lot, and for everyone to work together to make things easy. Is this appropriate? We hereby submit this report to the Council for review and approval. It will be a great kindness."</p>

<p>Recently, the Shanghai County Government received reports from the first and fourth districts stating that continuous rain has flooded farmland, making an autumn harvest hopeless and creating a disaster situation. They requested that an inspection be conducted and relief be provided. The County Farmers' Association also submitted a report with the same information and requested that it be forwarded for consideration of reducing land taxes to alleviate the people's difficulties. Subsequently, an order was received from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs instructing them to fill out a form and report the disaster situation. County Magistrate Yan raised the issue at the 67th County Administration Meeting to discuss relief measures. He appointed Zhu Fangshi and Fu Dianying to accompany Chen and Cheng, two members of the Finance Bureau, to inspect the villages in the first district of Minhang and the fourth district of Sanlintang with the district chiefs some days ago. They returned to the county yesterday and have submitted a report on the actual disaster situation in the two districts for review.</p>

<p>International Resolution to Reduce Miners' Working Hours</p>
<p>No Division for China in This Re-election of Labor Director</p>
<p>Yang Youren, the labor representative from China to the 15th International Labor Conference of the League of Nations in Geneva, and his advisor Lang Xingshi, have returned to Shanghai on the Japanese Postal Steamship Company's ship, Zhaoguo Maru, from Marseille, France, after completing their mission. The ship arrived at the Japanese Postal Steamship Company's pier on Yangzi Road, east of the Waibaidu Bridge, at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Shanghai Publishing Industry Union and representatives from other unions, as well as friends and relatives of Yang and Lang, went to the pier to welcome them. After Yang and others went ashore, they returned to their residences to rest with friends. According to Yang, he told the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter about their participation in the Labor Conference. The Chinese delegation to the International Labor Conference included Zhu Maocheng, Jiang Lufu (Acting Envoy to Italy) representing the government, Yu Benren representing labor, Zhang Xianglin and Lang Xingshi as advisors, and Bei Songsun and Kong Qingzong representing capital, totaling seven people. They arrived at the meeting on May 28th. Bei Songsun, the representative of capital, did not attend the meeting because he was unable to participate. The meeting closed on June 18th. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to reduce the working hours of coal miners by a quarter of an hour from eight hours to seven hours and forty-five minutes. The working hours of women working at night were not changed. The age of non-industrial child laborers was set at under 18 years old. As for the re-election of the directors of the Labor Council, there were twelve government representatives, six labor representatives, and six capital representatives, totaling twenty-four people. No one from China was elected. The Chinese government representative was only four votes short. On July 9th, Yu and Advisor Lang returned to China from Marseille.

<h3 id="e158">Establishment of the Zhonghua Book Company Office <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (August 7th) at 4:00 PM, the Zhonghua Book Company held a general meeting of members at the Zhonghua Book Company's main factory on Jing'an Temple Road to formally establish the Zhonghua Book Company Office of the Publishing Industry Union. The union had previously submitted a request to the higher authorities for approval and was notified that it had been approved for record-keeping. The General Manager of the Zhonghua Book Company was informed by letter, requesting that employees be allowed to leave work early so that members could participate. On that day, over 500 employees of the company participated. Representatives from the Party and government agencies, including Wu Jiaze from the Municipal Party Department and Gu Bingyuan from the Social Affairs Bureau, attended to provide guidance. All members of the board of directors and supervisors of the Municipal Publishing Industry Union attended. Guests included representatives from various unions, the Commerce Office, the World Book Company, and the Public Concession Police Department. Despite the heat, the members stood and waited in an orderly manner. At 4:00 PM, the meeting was officially announced, and Mei Yujin, Wang Jiping, Huang Zhuting, Tao Shunbao, and Yang Yinlin were elected as the five-member presidium, with Qian Fuhai as the recorder. Chairman Huang Zhuting reported the purpose of the meeting. Wu Jiaze, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, stating that the Zhonghua Book Company Union had already been established in 1927. Why was it being organized again today? Because the government had not yet promulgated laws and regulations to protect labor organizations, and the workers' own solidarity was not strong enough, resulting in its invisible disappearance. He hoped that they would unite more closely in the future. Furthermore, the capital side often misunderstands that workers organizing unions is detrimental to the capital side. They do not know that although unions seek the welfare of workers on the one hand, they also strive for production based on the principle of labor-capital cooperation. Now, the government has promulgated various laws and regulations, and various organizations can be organized according to law. For example, the business community has chambers of commerce and trade associations. We in the labor community should join unions and have labor laws to protect us. Furthermore, the strength of the Zhonghua Book Company Office lies in all of you. Everyone should take responsibility and not give up. Gu Bingyuan, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered a speech, stating that the Publishing Industry Union is currently the leader of all unions in Shanghai, because its members are a group of intellectuals. He congratulated them on their success in holding the inaugural meeting, hoping that they would unite and fight legally. On the one hand, he asked them to pay attention to increasing productivity so that the cultural cause could develop. Hou Dachun, the representative of the Publishing Industry Union, delivered a speech, stating that if our workers want to seek their own solutions, they should join the union. Perhaps there are a few workers who are not very clear about this, so I will explain in more detail to make you understand. The union's past work has been full of struggle and hardship. We have also made considerable efforts in supporting the government, such as overthrowing the Zhilu Army and clearing out the Communist Party. Furthermore, if there are capital-side running dogs who undermine the union for their own selfish gains, the union will punish them according to law, without showing any favoritism. You should also regard them as public enemies and not tolerate them. Finally, the representatives of the Commerce Office and other guests spoke in succession (speeches omitted). After the speeches, Mei Yujin and the other nine people were elected as executive officers, and Jin Enpu and the other four people were elected as alternate executive officers. They were sworn in on the spot. A proposal was discussed, which was a request from the Zhonghua Book Company employees to the capital side to improve treatment conditions, totaling eleven items. It was unanimously passed. The meeting adjourned at around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Employees of Inland River Steamships and Tugs</p>
<h3 id="e159">Affiliated with the Seamen's Union <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Gu Songlin and Sheng Fuquan, directors of the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Union, believed that the nature of inland river steamships and tugs was slightly different from that of ocean-going steamships and sailing ships. In July, they submitted a request to the Central Government to formulate separate laws and regulations for inland river steamship employees' unions, or to determine the nature of inland river steamship crew members in the regulations of the Seamen's Union. The Central Training Department reviewed and determined that although the scope of inland river steamships and ocean-going steamships is different, their nature is actually the same. Therefore, their organization should belong to the scope of seamen. Furthermore, although tugs on small boats are civil ships, they are attached to the business of steamships and should not be included in the scope of civil ships. They should be merged with steamship crew members and organized together. The Organizing Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union has complied with the order and notified them to follow it.</p>
<p>Commodity Inspection Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e160">Yesterday's Reception for the Silk Industry and Financial Circles <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry sent Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Raw Silk Inspection Office, and Dr. Li Yaobang to Japan last month to investigate the silk industry situation. They returned to China the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Zou Bingwen, director of the bureau, hosted leaders from the silk industry and financial circles of Jiangsu and Zhejiang at the Shanghai Bankers' Association to report on their trip. More than 20 people attended, including Zhang Gongquan, Chu Fucheng, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yang Dunfu, Shen Yichen, and Qian Fenghao. Director Zou introduced Miao Zhongxiu to give a report, which briefly stated that the scope of this trip to Japan included: (1) the process and current situation of Japan's silk industry relief, as well as future plans; (2) preparations for the compulsory implementation of raw silk grading and inspection in Japan; (3) silk fabric inspection methods; (4) warehouse organization, etc. Today, what I want to tell you is the first item. Since July 1929, the price of silk in Japan has shown a downward trend. In November, the silk industry association decided to reorganize the Imperial Silk Company to accept 50,000 bales of raw silk at a price of 1,250 yuan per dan (called joint custody). At the same time, it was decided that work would be completely suspended in the second half of December and that 20% of production capacity would be suspended from February 1, 1930, to May 31, to provide relief. In reality, the Imperial Silk Company only accepted 14,000 bales, and the reduction in production was ineffective, and the silk market still showed no improvement. Therefore, in January 1930, further relief methods were sought, and the silk industry association decided again: (1) the silk stored by the Imperial Silk Company would be inspected and graded by the Raw Silk Inspection Institute, and those with grades above the standard would be able to increase their mortgage funds; (2) the previous agreement for the custody of 50,000 bales would continue to be implemented, and the right to sell the jointly held raw silk would be given to a special committee; (3) the Imperial Silk Company would bear the loss of 100 yuan per dan, and those requesting a mortgage would bear six months of storage rent and interest, and after six months, all expenses would be borne by the Imperial Silk Company. This decision still did not have much effect. In the spring of 1930, the government promulgated regulations to relieve the silk industry, stipulating that 30 million yuan would be allocated within five years to compensate for the losses of banks accepting raw silk as collateral. On March 8, the government decided to accept 150,000 bales (85,000 packages) of raw silk of standard grade and above at a silk price of 1,250 yuan per dan. By the end of March of that year, the Imperial Silk Company had collected 50,000 bales, and by June 10, the banks had also collected 150,000 bales, for a total of 112,000 packages of raw silk. In addition to the above plan of the government and silk merchants to jointly store raw silk to stabilize silk prices, the silk industry also decided to reduce working hours from eleven to ten hours. However, despite the above relief plans, silk prices continued to fall. By the time of the new cocoons in July, there was an accumulation of 134,000 packages of raw silk. In addition, the harvest of new cocoons in 1930 was abundant, and the silk market was even more sluggish. The silk industry association decided again: (1) to petition the government to extend the term of the silk industry relief regulations (the implementation period of the regulations was originally scheduled to end in October 1930) to June 30, 1932; (2) half of the 112,000 packages of raw silk mortgaged by the Imperial Silk Company and the banks would be sold domestically within three years, and the remaining half would be sold at 3,000 packages per month starting from March 1, 1931; (3) all silk factories in the country would suspend work in mid-March of the 20th year; (4) the relief reserve fund (originally set at 4.5 yuan per package of raw silk sold) would be increased to 7.18 yuan per package (7 yuan borne by the silk factory and 0.18 yuan borne by the broker). After the above decision, although work was completely suspended in mid-March, the factories increased their production rate in mid-April. In practice, this regulation was equivalent to being ineffective. Regarding the sales method, only 3,000 packages were sold in mid-May, and the proposal for continued sales was invisibly abandoned. This is the process of the Japanese government and silk merchants jointly relieving the silk industry. Currently, there are more than 40 silk factories in Japan, with more than 300,000 silk looms, producing more than 60,000 packages of silk per month, of which more than 40,000 packages are exported, and the rest are sold domestically. There is no concern about excess supply and demand. As for the stock of more than 109,000 packages of silk, although there is a proposal to sell half domestically and half abroad within three years, due to various political and financial reasons, it is unlikely to be sold immediately and is not a cause for concern. The following points should be noted in future plans: (1) starting in 1932, the government will compulsorily implement grading and inspection to reduce various difficulties in trade and seek uniformity in products; (2) the original various associations of the silk industry will be united to form a national silk association to concentrate the power of merchants and cooperate with the government to carry out various undertakings; (3) within three years, 5 million Japanese yen will be used to promote silk fabrics in the United States to increase raw silk sales; (4) the addition of silk factories will be restricted to reduce production; (5) although government expenses will be reduced, research expenses will still be increased to expand research work; (6) small-scale silk factories will be merged to reduce production costs and standardize quality. In 1923, there were 4,309 silk factories and 200,588 silk looms. In 1929, the number of silk factories decreased to 3,719, while the number of silk looms increased to 326,976. (7) Various research projects aim to reduce production costs and unify and improve quality. The development of the Japanese silk industry has three characteristics: (1) government promotion; (2) silk merchant efforts; (3) expert research. The crystallization of the work in these three aspects has created this magnificent silk industry. If China wants to develop its silk industry, it cannot be effective without the cooperation of the government, merchants, and experts. It is hoped that the central government will quickly establish a research institution and gather famous scientists and experts from all over the country to jointly study and solve China's silk problems, which is promising.</p>

<h3 id="e162">French Municipal Council Plans to Lay Off Employees and Reduce Government Spending <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>To compensate for the decrease in revenue</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that the French Concession Municipal Council, in view of the expected decrease in revenue next year, has decided to lay off some foreign employees to reduce expenditures. The French Consul General, Mr. Gengelin, has ordered various departments to prepare reorganization plans and submit them for review. The reporter visited Consul General Gengelin yesterday. Mr. Gengelin frankly stated that the Municipal Council's revenue next year may be greatly reduced because after the return of the French public trial, there will be one less item of judicial revenue. In addition, after the transfer of wharf dues collected from the Chinese area to the municipal government, the Municipal Council's annual revenue will inevitably be affected. Furthermore, after the suspension of commercial reports by the residential radio station, municipal revenue will also be affected. However, this year's revenue will not be significantly reduced. Next year will be different. Moreover, if the price of silver falls further, the salaries of council members who are paid in silver will have to be increased accordingly. Therefore, it is necessary to lay off employees and reduce government spending to compensate. Currently, some foreign employees whose contracts have expired and who have taken leave to return to their home countries will not return to Shanghai. However, the number of police and firefighters will not be affected. After the West Prison is handed over to Chinese management, the prison staff will also be transferred back to the police department for duty.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Lease Agreement and Bandit Prevention Issues <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Real Estate Association Sent a Letter to Local Real Estate Companies Yesterday</p>
<p>Based on the explanation of the Shanghai Municipal Council's reply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to local real estate companies yesterday (7th), which stated: "With regard to the lease agreement, it is a mandatory provision of Article 5 of the Regulations for Punishing Bandits. Now that bandits are rampant and bandit dens can be found everywhere, if there is no lease agreement for the rented house, the property is at risk of being confiscated. For the sake of safeguarding the interests of the real estate industry, the Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement to inquire about its opinion. The Council replied that 'Your letter of July 10, which suggests that tenants must provide a lease agreement to prevent bandits from mingling, has been received with respect.' The following solutions are respectfully submitted for your consideration: (A) (1) As tenants may not be able to obtain a valuable lease agreement, the Association should inform the principal tenants that they may not sublet the remaining houses without informing the landlord. (2) If a principal tenant sublets the remaining houses, even if they have complied with the previous provision, they must still be responsible to the landlord and declare that the status of the subtenant has been notified to the relevant police station for investigation to ensure that they are of good character. If there is any concealment, they will be subject to expulsion. (3) Principal tenants who rent new houses in the future must obtain a lease agreement and hand it over to the landlord for safekeeping. The landlord must hire staff to verify the guarantors one by one to prove that they are reliable and trustworthy. (4) If anyone with suspicious behavior comes to rent a house, they must be reported to the police. (5) Without notifying the landlord or their agents, the police and clerks may not rent out the houses directly. (B) The lease agreement must be prepared in duplicate, one for the landlord and one for the guarantor. If the lease is terminated and the guarantee is released, the two copies should be exchanged and canceled. The landlord should still keep the canceled lease agreement for reference. (C) The lease agreement should be handled directly between the guarantor and the landlord after being introduced by the tenant. If the tenant terminates the lease, the release of the guarantee should still be handled by the guarantor themselves, so that the guarantor can impose sanctions on the guaranteed party at any time. The so-called lease agreement is only for the purpose of providing a guarantee and has nothing to do with rent payment, etc. As for the tenant registration form, all police stations in the settlement have them and can be obtained at any time. If the Association wants to further study this issue, please send representatives to meet with the Chief of Police to discuss it. We are eager to hear from you, etc.' In view of this, in addition to sending representatives to contact the Chief of Police, we hereby request that you investigate and take note of it, lest you delay and regret it later.

<p>Passersby Blew Whistles Madly</p>
<p>Police Shot and Pursued</p>
<p>Resulted in the Death of a Bandit</p>
<p>Tao Was Safe and Sound</p>
<p>Tao Rangqing from Chuansha, who lives on North Fujian Road, was in his car at about 8:20 last night when four bandits suddenly appeared and tried to kidnap him. Fortunately, the victim was alert and shouted loudly. Three Chinese constables from the Huizi Police Station happened to be passing by and arrived after hearing the news, and shot and killed one bandit. Tao also escaped safely. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Four Bandits Tao Rangqing, 60 years old, made his fortune in real estate. He lives at No. 474, North Fujian Road, north of Qipu Road. At 8:15 last night, he planned to go out to watch a movie and took his own car, No. 3873, driven by his driver Sang Quangen. After Tao got into the car, just as the driver started the engine, four bandits suddenly came from the north and blocked the car, trying to drag Tao Rangqing out. Tao saw that the situation was not good and shouted loudly that he was being robbed and kidnapped. At this time, a passerby named Mr. Jia, who carried a whistle, took it out and blew it madly after hearing the alarm. Many people echoed him.</p>
<p>Chinese Constables Pursued The bandits panicked after hearing the whistle and turned to flee, but they still held box cannons in their hands. Tao saw the bandits retreating and also intended to get out of the car to pursue them. At this critical moment, three Chinese constables from the Huizi Police Station, No. 682, No. 3060, and No. 2671, came from the north. After hearing the whistle and the sound of people, they immediately rushed forward to pursue the bandits and opened fire on them.</p>
<p>One Bandit Shot and Killed The four bandits fled north. Near Haining Road, one bandit was shot and fell to the ground. He died soon after due to his serious injuries. The remaining bandits escaped without a trace. It is said that a total of four shots were fired on the spot. The bandits did not retaliate because they were in a hurry to escape. After the incident, the Huizi Police Station immediately sent detectives to search for the escaped bandits. The Chinese constables were returning from official business at the police station at the time.</p>

<p>At 8:45 last night, Jin Kerang (from Suqian), a police officer from the Second Precinct of the First District in Nanshi, was on duty at Post No. 21 in the Old School Field when he suddenly saw more than ten people dressed in dark blue Xiangyun gauze shirts and pants, resembling gangsters, gathering in one place and whispering to each other. Their behavior was very suspicious. For the sake of caution, the police officer immediately took down the Type 38 rifle he was carrying on his shoulder, loaded it, and went to disperse them. However, the group scattered and gathered again, and the number of people increased compared to before. After dispersing them for the second time, the police officer saw that the people had all left and intended to unload the bullet. However, due to negligence, there was a loud bang, and the bullet came out of the gun. At that time, Ding Lianchang (24 years old, from Pudong), an employee of the Lao Bishi New Leather Shoe Store at No. 125, was enjoying the cool air at the door. The ruthless lead hit Ding's forehead squarely, piercing the occipital bone and shattering a piece of glass. Ding fell to the ground immediately, his brains splattered and died. Yi, the director of the Second Precinct of the First District, received the news and led Inspector Li and others to investigate. He immediately detained the police officer Jin Kerang who had caused the trouble and sent him to the station to await interrogation. He also reported to the local security and urgently reported the incident to the local court, requesting that the body be examined and prepared for burial tomorrow.</p>

<p>Jiang Dezhong Died So Suddenly</p>
<p>Liu Ribin Caused a Death</p>
<p>Jiang Bicheng, 49 years old, from Funing, lives at No. 11, Triangle Street, Nanshi. He has a son named Dezhong, who is 16 years old. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00, Dezhong finished his meal at home and invited Liu Ribin from Yancheng, whom he knew, to go to the Youche Wharf in Pubin to bathe in cold water. Liu did not know how to swim, so he watched from the shore. Dezhong took off his clothes and jumped into the water to swim. While he was having a good time, Liu suddenly joked to Dezhong and said loudly, "The water police are coming!" in order to scare him. Dezhong was greatly frightened when he heard the sound and immediately rushed back to the shore. When he looked back, there was no movement, and he knew that Liu had deliberately frightened him. He was so angry that he scolded Liu to his face. Then, a verbal dispute arose, followed by a conflict. Liu then raised his hand and pushed Dezhong's chest hard, causing Dezhong to lose his balance and fall into the bamboo fence next to him. In a moment, he didn't say a word, and his face was pale. Ding Guitao, a volunteer police officer from the First Precinct of the First District, heard the news and rushed over. When he felt him, Dezhong had already died of exhaustion. He arrested Liu and brought him back to the station. During the preliminary trial by the director of the station, Jiang Bicheng, the father of the deceased, heard the news and complained about the previous situation, requesting redress. Liu Ribin, 18 years old, who lives at No. 12, Qingyan Workshop, and makes a living by pulling a cart, confessed that he had joked with Dezhong, who became angry and insulted him and slapped him in the face. He pushed him, and he fell to the ground and died, etc. Because the case involved death, he was ordered to prepare a document and report it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Shot His Concubine <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Due to a Quarrel</p>
<p>The Perpetrator Fled After the Incident</p>
<p>Zhang Yushu from Hubei works as a butler in the residence of an American at No. 407, Mayersie Avenue, French Concession. His wife and concubine, Ms. Chen, about 30 years old (both from Hubei), lived together as laundry maids. Yesterday morning at 11:30, for some unknown reason, Zhang suddenly had a quarrel with his concubine, Ms. Chen. Zhang went upstairs to the master's room and took a pistol owned by the master for self-defense. He rushed to the kitchen and aimed the gun at Ms. Chen's chest and fired. The bullet hit her chest, pierced her back, and she fell to the ground, bleeding like a spring. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, Zhang abandoned the gun and fled with his wife. Later, his master, an American named L.H. Wellman, reported the incident to the Lujiiawan Police Station. The head of the police immediately sent detectives to investigate. Ms. Chen was taken to the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment, but she had already died of exhaustion before arriving at the hospital due to the injury being in a vital part. The body was transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. Since there were no family members, the police station reported to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Lou Guangguang, Clerk Zhao Yifen, and Medical Examiner Wei Ligong to arrive at the hall at 3:00 pm to examine the body. According to the report of the detective, Mr. Lou instructed to examine and confirm that Zhang Chen was indeed killed by a gunshot and that the perpetrator Zhang Yushu and others were on the run and should be arrested and sent to the hospital for investigation. The body was buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. After the examination, the police station took a photo of the body and then issued a coffin for burial, which was transported to the tomb.</p>

<p>Yuan Asheng Suddenly Lost His Niece</p>
<p>Yuan Amei Was Induced to Flee</p>
<p>Tao Wushi Designed to Move</p>
<p>Lu Chunsheng Uncovered the Secret</p>
<p>Yuan Asheng, 56 years old, from Shaoxing, currently lives at No. 13, Lane 326, Jiangyin Street, Nanshi, and earns a living by weaving cotton belts. Yuan has a 15-year-old niece named Amei, who lives with Yuan and can barely make ends meet. Next door at No. 11 is the residence of Tao Wushi (52 years old), a female tailor from Chuansha. Tao has a son named Bogui, 14 years old. Usually, the two families have a very good relationship and often visit each other. However, on the morning of the first of this month at 9:00 am, Yuan ordered Amei to go out to buy straw paper, but she suddenly disappeared and never returned. Yuan sent out detectives everywhere, but there was no news. Yuan carefully examined again and again and believed that Wushi was highly suspicious. He immediately questioned her, but Wushi consistently denied it. Until yesterday morning, Wushi suddenly moved, which made Yuan even more suspicious. He remained calm and secretly sent his apprentice Lu Chunsheng (24 years old, from Taixing) to follow her when she hired a car to transport all her belongings. The car arrived at a lane entrance on Luban Road in the French Concession, and he witnessed the belongings being moved one by one into a stone gate. Lu hid nearby to observe the situation. After a short while, he suddenly saw Wushi hurriedly approach the side of a large leather suitcase and unlock it with a key. He saw a young woman jump out of the box. Upon closer inspection, it was Yuan Amei. Lu ran out and called the nearby Chinese constables to arrest Wushi and her son, as well as Amei, and took them to the police station. After the head of the police briefly questioned them, because the case belonged to the Chinese area, he sent Detective Liu Fayou to escort all the people to the Second District Headquarters. District Chief Wang immediately conducted a preliminary trial. Yuan Asheng then explained the situation of Amei's disappearance. Yuan Amei testified that one day at 9:00 am, she went out to buy goods and met a man wearing white willow striped shirt and pants, speaking the Pudong dialect, whose surname she did not know. He said he was 17 years old and asked her to play nearby. Then he took her to a small inn, where she was raped for five nights. Yesterday, the man hired a car to send her back, but she was afraid of being scolded by her uncle, so she asked Wushi to help her hide it. Today, Wushi hid her in a box and used the excuse of moving to move her out, etc. When questioned, Tao Wushi's testimony was vague. District Chief Wang, considering that the case was bizarre, prepared a document and reported it to the Judicial Section for review.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Robbery and Pawning, Injuring People <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Five Bandits Robbed With Guns</p>
<p>Bandits Fired Stray Bullets Injuring Passersby</p>
<p>Yesterday (7th) morning at about 7:00, a major case of robbery and pawning and shooting of pedestrians occurred on Jiangyin Street outside Xiaoximen. The details are as follows: Juyuan Pawnshop at No. 327, Jiangyin Street, is a single-story stone gate, which has been open for several years. The counter was originally equipped with wooden fences. Recently, because the side door next to the counter was damaged, Carpenter Lu Arong (from Yuyao) was hired to repair it. Yesterday (7th) morning at 7:30, the carpenter removed the side door and was working when five bandits suddenly appeared. Three bandits were on guard outside the door, and two bandits went inside and threw a set of white cloth short shirts and pants they were holding on the counter, asking for a pledge, and at the same time showing a pistol, threatening them to keep quiet. Because the side door was open, the two bandits calmly broke into the counter, and the bandit holding the gun monitored the actions of the pawnshop employees. Another bandit looted the drawer, taking more than 80 silver dollars, more than 500 small silver dollars, and 4 silver dollar notes. Not satisfied, they also looted a long-style platinum watch and a silver chain on the counter. When the bandits were looting, the packing employee upstairs noticed and blew the whistle madly upstairs. The police on duty at the post heard the sound and rushed over, first reporting to the Second District Headquarters by telephone. District Chief Wang immediately led detectives to rush to round up the bandits, but the bandits had already left like the Yellow Crane. It was found that the entrance to the pawnshop was a vegetable market. When the bandits fled with the loot, they fired several shots. A stray bullet hit a vegetable-buying woman, piercing her leg, and another bullet injured the right leg of a child who was setting up an egg stall. They were taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment separately. It is said that the injuries were not serious. Afterwards, the pawnshop owner submitted a list to the Second District Police Station, requesting an investigation. Carpenter Lu Arong was suspected and was detained by the police and sent to the Second District. District Chief Wang submitted a proposal for investigation. Lu called out his injustice and was ordered to wait for further investigation. It is also said that the bandits all spoke with a northern accent and mostly wore blue cloth short shirts and pants.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Datongyang Class Dayu Sets Sail <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>A Supplement to the Dada New Ship</p>
<p>Scheduled to Start on the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>The various ships of the Datongyang Company's Yangtze River Tongyang Class have recently felt insufficient to manage. Since the Daji Wheel was burned, the original engine was still in good condition. Recently, in the middle of March, it was actively rebuilt and has been completed. It was test-driven the day before yesterday, and the speed of the wheel was very good. In a week, it will be officially launched for the Tongyang Class. The information obtained from yesterday's investigation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tongyang Class Wheel The Datongyang Company's Tongyang Class travels between various wheels. Recently, the Dahe, Daqing, and Dede wheels have been sailing continuously every day, from Shanghai to Yang and from Yang to Shanghai. Each round trip takes more than 70 hours. After the Daji Wheel suffered an accident, it was supplemented by the Hanping Wheel, which was designated to carry goods, to carry passengers and load goods. Since the Hanping Wheel was transferred to Nanjing in early last month, only three wheels have been traveling back and forth for the Tongyang Class.</p>
<p>Daji Rebuilt The Daji Wheel was contracted by the company to the Ruirong Shipyard and has been in operation for three months. All the ship's hull and cabins are built with iron plates. There are more than 50 rooms, and the total tonnage is more than 1,400. The net tonnage of cargo that can be loaded is more than 900. The ship can accommodate 8-900 people. The ship is 216 feet long and 36 feet wide. It has been completed. The car was changed in Songkou the day before yesterday, and the results were very good. The speed can reach 12 yards per hour, which is 3.3 nautical miles. It is said that the cost of rebuilding the wheel is nearly 200,000 yuan. The name of the wheel has been changed to Dayu.</p>
<p>Dayu Schedule Since the past month, only three wheels have been traveling back and forth in the Tongyang Class. The company has decided to add the new Dayu wheel to the sailing from the night of the 15th of this month and officially allocate it to the schedule.</p>
<p>Wharf Issues The wharves from No. 1 to No. 16 in the Hunan District must be repaired once every three years. This year is the repair period. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has hired workers to repair them. The Datong wheel停轮碼頭 is located between the No. 4 and No. 5 wharves in the Hunan District. Therefore, recently, due to wharf problems, passengers on various Datong wheels have to take boats to the vicinity of the wheel mark (buoy) for transfer to the wheel every night to load cargo and passengers. It is estimated that the No. 4 and No. 5 wharves will be completed in about three or four days. Therefore, the Dayu wheel will be able to board the wheel from the wharf when it sets sail on the 15th.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison</p>
<p>Wang Ruyuan from Jiangyin, colluded with his fellow villager Zhu Caibao, who had already been sentenced to one year in prison, to entice and rape his niece Wang Jinda on the afternoon of the 14th of last month at 6:00 PM. The case was discovered by the Chinese and foreign detectives of the Yangshupu Police Station, who brought them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details were previously reported, and they were detained pending the arrival of the victim Wang Jinda to testify. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiepan continued the trial in the Third Court. The lawyer for the police station, Li Zhishan, stated that Wang Jinda had come to Shanghai from Jiangyin to testify in court and requested to question her. According to the woman's statement, in March of this year, she was taken to Zhu Caibao's place near Xinzha Bridge by her uncle Wang Ruyuan, who said it would be fine for her to stay at his house, but she refused. They then went to the Huishan Hotel in Tilanqiao to open a room and sleep with Zhu for about two hours, after which he went out, claiming to go to Xinzha Bridge. Later, her uncle guaranteed that nothing would happen and tried to arrange a marriage. On the afternoon of June 14th at 6:00 PM, she left the sock factory after work, and Zhu Caibao was waiting for her and tricked her into going to his house, where she stayed for three nights. She was completely deceived by her uncle. When questioned, Wang Ruyuan's confession was evasive, claiming that Jin Da and Zhu Caibao were in love and that it was consensual, not that he had arranged it, and asked for leniency. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Xiao Xiepan ruled that the case had been proven by the victim, so there was no room for denial. He sentenced Wang Ruyuan to eight months in prison, and the number of days of detention before the final judgment would be counted as two days for one day of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Five Days of Detention</p>
<p>An elderly local woman surnamed Li, nearly sixty years old, rented a place near Huayuanshi Bridge in Pudong. Her son, Miaosheng, was also approaching thirty, but the family was destitute and unable to find a wife for him. Miaosheng constantly sighed and was depressed. In recent years, he had become even less motivated and was unemployed at home. One night, he returned home late and, not having had dinner, asked his mother for food. Li got up to cook again, but the rice was already cooked, and there was no way to buy side dishes. Miaosheng roared and beat his mother. Li was furious and reported it to the local police, who detained Miaosheng and brought him to the Third District. After questioning by the district chief, it was revealed that Li was disobedient and unfilial, violating human倫常. He was reprimanded on the spot and was going to be transferred to the court for strict punishment according to the law, but Li, with her deep maternal love, suddenly asked for him to be spared. The district chief then changed the sentence to five days of detention for Miaosheng to see if it would have any effect.</p>

<p>Fei Benxian, the former manager of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road, recently filed a lawsuit against Hong Xianfang, the general manager of the Far East, through a lawyer due to a dispute over salary. According to investigations, the Far East side claimed that Fei Benxian had misappropriated a large amount of public funds during his tenure. They asked Zhou Feiting, a director of the hotel, to mediate and temporarily allowed the delay. Unexpectedly, Fei filed a lawsuit in Liaodong to recover his salary. Hong had no choice but to hire lawyer Yuan Yang'an to appear in court and explain everything. He had presented various pieces of evidence. Now Fei realized that he was in the wrong and asked a celebrity named Cai to act as a mediator, requesting Hong Xianfang's leniency. On one hand, he voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit, and the Far East side, considering the mediator's request, decided to handle it leniently in the interest of peace. The salary dispute was likely to dissipate.</p>

<p>Shen Xiaobao, a seventeen-year-old girl from Shandong, was a female worker in the China Sack Factory on Lubensheng Road. At 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, while she was working, the belt on the machine suddenly broke. The girl was struck by the belt and severely injured, falling to the ground unconscious. Zhang Aiqiao, another female worker, saw this and immediately reported it to the factory supervisor. Shen Xiaobao was taken to Guangren Hospital, but she died despite treatment. The hospital reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road.

<h3 id="e178">Garrison Headquarters Investigates Assassin of Security Officer <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Li Maolin of Liangxi Hotel</p>
<p>Repeatedly Summoned for Joint Trial</p>
<p>On March 6th of this year, the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau intercepted seven robbers near the Siming Guild Hall in Xiaobeimen. However, one of the seven, Wang Yaoting from Wuxi, suddenly implicated himself in the assassination of An Zhendong, a patrol officer of the Fourth District of Zhabei, in December of last year, admitting to being the perpetrator and claiming that the mastermind was Li Maolin, the owner of the Liangxi Hotel on Hubei Road in the Public Concession. Details had been previously reported in this newspaper. After several court hearings in the Special District Court, it was determined that Wang's confession was untrue, and Li was released on bail. Later, the Public Security Bureau sent Wang and the other six to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for review. Wang still claimed that Li was the mastermind of the An case. The Military Law Office, for the sake of caution, repeatedly investigated and summoned Li to court for confrontation three times. Li went willingly each time. Yesterday was the third trial, and Qi Haitian, the leader of the Detective Team handling the case, was also summoned to testify. As a result, Wang's confession was vague. Li Maolin stated that Wang and his accomplices had stayed at the Liangxi Hotel for thirty to forty days, owing a large amount of room fees. Unable to pay, they were evicted and bore a grudge, falsely accusing him. After a lengthy debate, the military judge ordered Li and Wang to be temporarily handed over to leader Qi of the Detective Team to thoroughly investigate and report back to the Public Security Bureau for further review.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bank's business has been booming recently, and the existing staff is insufficient. Although there are some highly educated individuals among those recommended, they are not familiar with the bank's operations, which seems less than ideal. Therefore, the bank has decided to recruit dozens of trainees. Applicants should have a high school sophomore level education or equivalent. Registration will be open every day from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. After being accepted, in addition to studying and interning, trainees will receive a monthly stipend of twenty yuan. At a time when the problem of student unemployment is particularly serious, the Shanghai Bank's open recruitment of true talent provides an extra avenue for high school students with real skills and knowledge, which is a rare opportunity. However, due to the large number of applicants in the previous recruitment, this time, only those with a proper job recommendation can register, indicating a slight restriction.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Minutes of the Executive Committee of the National Medicine Trade Association <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Trade Association held its 27th Executive Committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Zhuang Meitang. The following resolutions were passed: (1) (Omitted). (2) Regarding the case in which the association was previously ordered by the Central Executive Committee to amend the conditions of labor-capital treatment in this industry, we should continue to urge the competent authorities to expedite the handling of the case. Resolved: The association will send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Party and government agencies for prompt review and handling. (3) The association has now received approval from the Ministry of Industry to divide and organize the internal and external field clerks of this industry, with the internal clerks joining the union and the external clerks joining the association. Is this solution acceptable to the association? Resolved: Although this solution from the Ministry of Industry seems fair, the internal clerks of this industry are also commercial users who directly serve the store and have absolutely no technical skills or crafts. According to the law, it is actually impossible to organize a trade union. The association should prepare a document and present it to the Ministry of Industry again, continuing to strive for the goal of abolishing the trade union. (4) The association has repeatedly received reports from members Zidetang, Baoshengtang, Jishengtang, Taishantang, Zhang Hongji, and others that criminals have taken advantage of the opportunity to fill prescriptions at midnight, using counterfeit ten-yuan banknotes, and more than a dozen colleagues have been deceived and suffered losses. A prevention method should be devised quickly. Resolved: The association will publish an announcement in the newspaper and notify all its members and colleagues in the city to pay serious attention. (5) The association should immediately convene the annual general meeting of members for the year 1931. Resolved: The Secretariat will expedite the preparation of the various procedures for the meeting and then schedule the meeting.

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have just read a news item entitled "French Court Concludes Case with Settlement" in the local news section of your August 7th issue, which does not correspond with the facts. I am writing to correct this. Although the marriage dispute between Wu Li and Wu Shujun was scheduled to be heard on the 31st of last month, it was not tried or decided that day due to a backlog of cases. This is the first point that does not correspond with the facts. The statement "resolved with 5,000 yuan" is also inaccurate. This is the second point that does not correspond with the facts. The mediator for the defendant in the case was lawyer Yue Junying, which was omitted in the original text. This is the third point that does not correspond with the facts. I request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth and avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Yue Junying, Lawyer, August 7th,</p>

<p>"This is the latest style, please try it," a middle-aged shop assistant with a shiny head respectfully handed her a pair of snow-blue and white high-soled rattan shoes.</p>
<p>"I really like this style – it's just a bit too long." She slightly bent over, stepping her foot, clad in the new shoe, onto the velvet carpet, scrutinizing it repeatedly. Suddenly, a soft, cottony palm patted her shoulder, startling her, and she hurriedly turned around.</p>
<p>"Oh, Bi Lian, I wondered who it was – when did you arrive?" She gazed at her with a sincere, joyful, and slightly surprised look.</p>
<p>"Ah, how wonderful that we could meet here," Bi Lian said, holding her hand tightly. "Have you bought your shoes? Let's go outside and chat."</p>
<p>"Yes, this pair will do."</p>
<p>She picked up the shoe box and walked out of the department store with Bi Lian, turned along the cement pavement, and entered a Cantonese dim sum restaurant. It was about ten o'clock in the morning, and only a few people were scattered around the tables. They casually ordered some dim sum and started talking. Bi Lian told her many things, and then said, "Do you know? Uncle Pucheng passed away."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's dead... How could he die?" A cold, pale, and thin face seemed to float before her eyes.</p>
<p>"I heard he was spitting blood."</p>
<p>"Oh, spitting blood..." A bright red shadow of blood flashed swiftly before her eyes.</p>
<p>A severely cold winter, snowflakes flying chaotically in the air, the north wind beating against the glass windows like mad, making a pattering sound. The sharp wind, drilling in through the window gaps, carried snow dust and struck the patient's face. He immediately started shivering. He shrunk his face into the collar of his tattered overcoat, stretched out a bloodless hand, and tremblingly tucked the old velvet blanket covering his legs in tightly. This slight movement immediately caused him to cough raspingly.</p>
<p>"Uncle Wen, are you cold?" she said, looking at the patient with concern.</p>
<p>Uncle Wen nodded, coughing even more fiercely.</p>
<p>She gently closed the curtains, and the room was immediately shrouded in a gray shadow, presenting a desolate and eerie scene.</p>
<p>She slowly walked back to her original seat and sat down, gazing gloomily at the patient's gaunt face, lifeless eyes, constantly choking and coughing, twitching... She couldn't help but feel a throbbing in her heart, as if a terrible horror would descend immediately upon this gloomy environment, and as if blood-red long tongues, disheveled long hair, and giant palms were flying and flashing back and forth before her. She was so frightened that she dared not look at the patient anymore. "Why isn't Aunt here yet?" she murmured from time to time.</p>
<p>After a burst of violent choking, Uncle Wen's face turned even more frighteningly pale. He said in a weak voice, "Yi, look, there seems to be blood." She stood up hurriedly and looked into the spittoon, so shocked that she almost cried out. It was so fresh, so red, like it had just been dripping from a chicken's neck, filling the spittoon with a foul, bloody smell.</p>
<p>"Oh, there really is blood. Let's grind some ink and drink it," she said, trying her best to suppress her fear and stay calm.</p>
<p>Uncle Wen shook his head, and a terrible, life-despairing pain was revealed in his dry eyes. He sighed slightly and turned his face inward.</p>
<p>Matted hair, a few yellow and pale whiskers under his chin, an open mouth... Gloom, silence. She fell into a realm of terror again.</p>
<p>"Heavens, Aunt is here!" She heard the sound of the door opening. As she ran to the narrow, dark alley, she encountered a dark, small figure. He was wearing a wide-brimmed woolen hat, his chin deeply hidden in the fur collar of his overcoat, the brim of the hat pressed low, obscuring the upper half of his face. She looked closely and recognized him as Uncle Pucheng.</p>
<p>"Is Uncle Wen in? It's so cold, he wouldn't have gone out, would he?" he asked, taking off his hat and using a handkerchief to brush off the snowflakes.</p>
<p>"He's at home – but, he's very ill," she said, staring blankly at Uncle Pucheng, trying to find a hint of pity in his cold eyes.</p>
<p>"Hmph, ill..." He made a snorting sound from his nostrils, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. He didn't ask anything else and quickly walked into the room.</p>
<p>"Wen, how are you? You should remember, the appointment we made the other day," Uncle Pucheng said, opening his small eyes wide and sitting on the chair by the door.</p>
<p>"Ah, Brother Pu, look, I've been very ill these past two days," Uncle Wen said, furrowing his brow and struggling to sit up. "I really don't know what to say. I'm so sorry."</p>
<p>"Sorry... I'm tired of hearing that word," he said, shaking his head, taking out a cigarette from his pocket, and lighting it. White smoke escaped from the corner of his mouth, billowing and spreading. Soon, the room was filled with smoke, and Uncle Wen, stimulated by the strong fumes, began to cough and choke incessantly.</p>
<p>"Alas, Brother Pu, I understand your kindness to me – but, I'm poor and sick, what can I do?" Uncle Wen said, panting.</p>
<p>"Who isn't poor? You have to find a way," he said, opening his eyes wide and shaking his leg casually.</p>
<p>"Yes, when I get better, I'll find something to do, and I'll definitely pay you back first," Uncle Wen said, a terrible bitter smile appearing on his face. He seemed to know that this hope was just a vague and elusive illusion for him.</p>
<p>"Get better? Of course, that's what I hope. But," he said, exhaling a puff of smoke, "you should understand yourself, how far your illness has progressed – and how can I let you keep owing me? Do you understand what I mean?" he said with an impatient look.</p>
<p>"Heavens, how am I to atone for this?" Uncle Wen pressed his hands against his chest and let out a long sigh. Two bitter tears rolled down from the corners of his sunken eyes, followed by several rasping coughs, a lump of phlegm stuck in his throat, going up and down but unable to be expectorated.</p>
<p>"Consumption, consumption... What hope is there?" He murmured, standing up, shaking his head, and walking back and forth in the room, as if calculating something.</p>
<p>At this moment, she was completely immersed in an atmosphere of silence. She was stirred by a sorrowful, resentful, and uncontrollable impulse. She stared at Uncle Pucheng's face with disgust, hatred, and hostility, but he seemed to pay no attention at all.</p>
<p>"What, are you saying? Clothes can also be used as collateral," he said suddenly, his eyes darting around.</p>
<p>"Clothes? I have nothing left – only this," Uncle Wen said, trembling as he stood up from the reclining chair, his body swaying from side to side. He pulled out a tattered fur robe from under the reclining chair, which he had been using as a cushion, and sat down again, saying, "This is all I have left. If you want it, take it."</p>
<p>"What's this worth? It's not even enough for a month's interest," Uncle Pucheng said, holding the robe in his hand, folding it slightly, and tucking it under his arm. He looked around again and said, "What else is there? What are we going to do?"</p>
<p>"Half a month later, perhaps?" Uncle Wen said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"That's too long. I can't wait."</p>
<p>"Ten days, then?"</p>
<p>"Still not enough."</p>
<p>"Alas, you have to let me find a way," Uncle Wen pleaded with him.</p>
<p>"Three days, no later than that," he said, glaring maliciously at Uncle Wen, and left without waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>After Uncle Wen watched him leave, he just stared at the ceiling and sighed, "Consumption... consumption," he repeated in a low voice. His expression became terribly frightening. He seemed to have already seen Death standing before him. Pain, despair, the terror of death, and the longing for life flashed momentarily in his faded eyes (she was simply terrified to the point of tears, even though she was only twelve years old).</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, Uncle Pucheng came to Uncle Wen's house again to demand payment, and said many unpleasant things. By then, Uncle Wen was no longer able to speak. Phlegm rattled in his throat, his eyes staring blankly. Soon, he took with him the final contempt and disgust that the world had given him, and exhaled his last breath.</p>
<p>This tragic and cruel image was forever etched as a deep scar in her memory, especially the cold, pale, and thin face of Uncle Pucheng.</p>
<p>"Oh, he's dead, he died spitting blood," she couldn't help but repeat.</p>

<h3 id="e205">After Reading "War at the National Gate" <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Tiehua</p>
<p>To mention Mr. Wang Guoan's "War at the National Gate", one cannot help but also mention Mr. Huang Zhenxia's "On the Longhai Railway Line". Indeed, "Avant-Garde Monthly" successively published these two great works, which made me feel the power of literature and moved me to tears. When I pick up my pen to write these thoughts after reading, my enthusiasm surges uncontrollably. Great is "War at the National Gate"!</p>
<p>Who says that Chinese troops are incapable of fighting the enemy? Who says that there are no glorious battles in the history of national humiliation? Before reading the main text of "War at the National Gate", please first look at a few sentences in Huang Zhenxia's preface—</p>
<p>"In the Sino-Russian Manchuria Incident—excluding the eastern front of Tongjiang Mishan, solely based on the battle situation of Manchouli Zhalainuo'er, the Chinese army used a total force of 15,000, 4 cannons, and 2 aircraft. The Soviet Union imperialists used a total force of about 50,000, 200 cannons, 30 aircraft, and 30 tanks. Although the result was defeat due to being outnumbered, the enemy army suffered heavy casualties."</p>
<p>In such a battle situation with such a disparity in strength, the outcome is obviously predictable, but the loyal and brave soldiers ultimately exhausted their last breath in battle, burying their bright flesh and blood forever at the national gate. Just the few words, "Goodbye... beloved national gate... your children are powerless, farewell," are a tragic and heroic affair. Mr. Wang Guoan, as a company commander, experienced all the hardships and struggles, with a body covered in blood and a stomach full of indignation, jumped out of the trench and wrote this great work of 60,000 words, which is naturally even more passionate and intimate. I can boldly say that whoever reads it will not be moved.</p>
<p>There have been a few war novels in China, but nothing as great as "On the Longhai Railway Line" and "War at the National Gate". The former is a record of revolutionary battles, the latter is an account of a battle in the history of national struggle. Due to the differences in facts, reading "War at the National Gate" after reading "On the Longhai Railway Line" makes it feel even more grand, worthy of singing, and tearful. In a weak and poor China, there was still this battle at the national gate, and in a weak and poor Chinese literary world, there is still this "War at the National Gate", both are remarkable and astonishing feats. This is probably not just my personal frenzy.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this article, Manchouli is first written, and the situation and conditions of Manchouli are described very clearly. From the very ordinary New Year's reunions of many officers, the red terror is introduced in the green wine and red lights of the banquet, along with ironclad evidence of the Soviet Red imperialists' disregard for peace and their atrocities. The clouds of war gradually tightened, forcing them to pick up their guns and defend themselves in a desperate battle, until they were exhausted. The entire story is full of tense battle conditions and raging flames, making the reader wish they could roar, dance, and rush into the enemy ranks just like the author.</p>
<p>During the group banquet, the regimental commander jokingly said that Company Commander Wan's wife, Liubo, was a Red Russian, which flustered Company Commander Wan. He wrote,</p>
<p>"I was savoring the taste of being surrounded by beauty when I suddenly heard the regimental commander ask me that, which made me stunned for a long time and didn't know how to answer. Everyone thought it was because I had too much wine, and Liubo (his Russian wife) also noticed that the regimental commander was calling me, she kept pushing me with her hand, I had to stand up and say very flusteredly,</p>
<p>"Report to the regimental commander, Liubo's family is very well-off, her parents temporarily joined the party because they couldn't bear the coercion of the Red Russians, I have investigated it very clearly, I hope the regimental commander can believe it."</p>
<p>But once the war machine was launched, many spies were lurking in Manchouli to carry out sabotage, assassinations, and intelligence gathering. Company Commander Wan still didn't expect that his wife Liubo was really a spy. As things gradually became clear and he himself became aware of it, Wan was suddenly dismissed from his post with a baffling charge of "unauthorized departure from the defense area." At the same time, the chief of staff sent him a pistol to ask him to resolve Liubo. In the end, in the midst of his children's affection, he ended the life of this wife-spy. He wrote this passage perfectly,</p>
<p>I held the Browning in my trouser pocket, turned on the safety, and quickly aimed at Maria (another female spy), at the same time I said in my mouth, "Hands up, quick, quick," I was looking at Maria, but Liubo suddenly took out a pistol from her pocket, before she leveled it, I felt a buzzing sound in my head like a pile of fire burning, my hand slightly to the right, aimed at Liubo, bang a shot, a flash of fire passed before my eyes, Liubo fell down, Maria was about to run, my heart moved, forget it, and with another wave of my hand, bang, Maria also fell down.</p>
<p>The street lights were flashing, and we were walking very fast, I felt a vague shadow of Liubo and Maria walking in front of me in the darkness, I was a little scared and sad in my heart...</p>
<p>After reading this description, the reader felt unusually happy, but his heart yearned like this, writing out the conflicting psychology of love and hate, private and public. But he was after all a good man,</p>
<p>I don't know why, it seemed that someone said in my ear, "You have won, your motherland has won," my spirit suddenly lifted a lot, and the national flag on the headquarters building also appeared in front of my eyes...</p>
<p>This twist made the whole article more vivid, I think readers will feel it, and Mr. Wan also in this twist, was reinstated and went back to the front line.</p>
<p>Red Russia's disregard for non-war covenants, and willingness to act</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Guilty of undermining peace, has now been seen by the world, but there is no justice and fairness in the world anymore, at that time, when the war machine had just started, our authorities were still calm, hoping for peaceful negotiations, but the result was that this chaotic situation was created, and the hot blood of millions of men was sacrificed under the Cossack's iron hooves, but the army lost ground. He wrote the following passage about the initial battle</p>
<p>It was probably the morning of August 16th, the east had just turned fish-belly white, and we could vaguely see many teams moving down the mountain on the mountain opposite our position, and as the sky gradually brightened, we could also see clearly that there were many cavalry and infantry (about 1,500 people) the vanguard cavalry had already crossed half of the river, and were advancing towards our position in a completely dense formation, we had already reported to the deputy brigade commander at this time, and all the soldiers on the entire line had also entered the position, because we had received an order from the brigade commander that no matter what, we were not allowed to shoot, at this time the brothers were all anxious and wanted to take advantage of their half-crossing to attack and annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop, but the order was stern, and everyone had to lie in the trenches and watch.....</p>
<p>Everyone who entered the position hated so much that they gnashed their teeth, and almost shouted out the sound of hitting, but the company and platoon leaders humbly comforted, "The order is important,"</p>
<p>When I read these connected paragraphs, I was so moved that my anger rose, thinking about how many mistakes the soldiers on the front line had made in this delay. There has never been justice in the world, only self-reliance can lead to fairness, at this critical moment, the authorities still tried their best to calm down, but they knew that their own land had been trampled by others. This situation, even we who were hiding far away, felt angry when we read the newspaper, let alone the author hiding in the trenches, and the writing was naturally even more angry.</p>
<p>But after a burst of fighting, the soldiers couldn't help but move forward like crazy, killing, killing, regardless of the fact that their own trenches had been flattened by the enemy's artillery fire, and their own brothers had already sacrificed 150 people in the first raid, and in the end, they drove the enemy back like a flood.</p>
<p>Our inflexible machine guns killed many enemies, and our soldiers were all happy to kill, if they didn't call out the brigade adjutant, they would all have crossed the river.</p>
<p>How strong was the morale at this time, the author drew out one red heart after another on the paper, I don't know how many people were moved, but the lone army was trapped, and there was no follow-up support, at the same time, the damned Feng Yuxiang, again took advantage of the crisis to rebel, and the brothers in front of the battle, so only waited for orders in a desperate defense, and the Red Russian's guns and iron hooves, continued to come without increase, alas, the sin of the soldiers,</p>
<p>He wrote a few paragraphs in Manchouli, which were really so magnificent</p>
<p>The gun was placed on the chest wall, and the food from the rear could not be sent up, everyone had to endure hunger, and wait for the enemy to stop firing before eating, but the shells kept flying, we firmly guarded, and never retreated one step, the brigade commander also sent an order, - our entire 15th brigade sacrificed together with Manchouli, whoever retreats first will be shot, this order was printed in our minds word by word, no matter how the enemy attacked, as long as we have one breath and one gun, we have to fight with the enemy...</p>
<p>Every minute and every second was spent in the enemy's guns and bullets, I watched one of my beloved brothers being killed by artillery fire, and two more were injured, two hours passed, my brothers were thirteen or fourteen injured, I was really a little crazy, I kept running up to stroke the dead body, fresh red blood flowed in the battle trench, and pieces of white brain splashed on the edge of the trench</p>
<p>Morning of November 17, 1918 of the Republic of China...</p>
<p>They jointly received the order from Commander Liang, - children, it is glorious and great to sacrifice for the motherland, you go and do it</p>
<p>After several consecutive waves of fierce attacks, the Red Cavalry was unable to succeed immediately thanks to the spirit of firm defense. Finally, the unfortunate record came,</p>
<p>"We had just celebrated the end of the storm when the enemy cavalry in front started attacking again, and the bullets killed almost all of the more than 5,000 knights, the bloodstains were left on the endless ice and snow, just as the gunfire stopped, more than a dozen enemy planes flew over and dropped bombs on the radio station, pop - pop pop, and the last radio telegram received, the radio station also collapsed along with the fate of the bomb,</p>
<p>Seeing "On this desolate, tragic and heroic evening, I received the order, - my battalion covers the retreat of my regiment, and the company covers the retreat of my battalion... The quiet night air also seemed to contain a sad component," there was a sense of gloom. "Finally, with a belly full of hot blood, they broke out of the encirclement of smoke and bullets, and looked sadly at the enemy's sickle and axe on the flagpole of Manchouli,"</p>
<p>At the end of the entire article, two letters recalling the loss were used as the ending, which I thought was very good. At the same time, it can be seen that the bold and sad feelings of the two soldiers are vividly expressed in the unadorned words, leaving their true colors.</p>
<p>In short, the entire article is 60,000 words long, and I can't cite more here. I think that although Mr. Wang Guoan did not die in battle, he still has these 60,000 words to atone for the crime of retreating from the war to the Chinese people. At this time when internal rebellions and external disasters are coming one after another, the people of the country should read this kind of creation carefully to stimulate the decline and excite the spirit. (I hope that those who are interested in domestic films should use this point to take material, its greatness should exceed "All Quiet on the Western Front" ten times, in a sluggish China, what is needed is this kind of theme of film,)</p>
<p>I also want to quote Huang Zhenxia's preface without fear of words</p>
<p>"The people hiding in the customs, the people in the big cities in the red lights and green wine, the people who are complaining in the pavilion room, the young people of China, do you still remember the shocking event of November 21, 1918 of the Republic of China, do you still remember 6,000 miles away, under the yellow sand and white grass or the snowy national gate, there were thousands of brave and sad northeastern heroes resisting the red terror, I am afraid that you have forgotten it completely, if you have forgotten it, please see "War at the National Gate,"</p>
<p>Finally, I repeat, "In a weak and poor China, there is still this battle, and in a weak and poor Chinese literary world, there is still this article," Here, I would like to pay tribute to the author,</p>
<h3 id="e206">How We Should Read <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>Edited by Fan Shou Kang</p>
<p>My younger brother is studying at a middle school. Recently, he wrote a letter asking me to buy some books and send them to him.</p>
<p>Speaking of books, as long as we casually step into any bookstore, they are all "stacked like mountains." However, among this "vast sea of books," it is rare to find one that can provide accurate guidance to middle school students on how to effectively study all subjects.</p>
<p>We well know that "there are two essential elements to reading: first, be precise; second, be broad." If we want to achieve "precision" in a certain academic field, then we must first seek the assistance of "breadth" in knowledge. During middle school, if a solid foundation is not laid in various courses, it will be difficult to reach advanced peaks in specialized schools. Thus, we feel how important middle school courses are. However, if we can obtain the most convenient path to achieve the ultimate goal of learning, in terms of success, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, to promote middle school students' ease of understanding of their coursework, guidance on a method of study is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Finally, I discovered such a book, one that encompasses the study and methods of six compulsory subjects. It is a collection of works by specialists in various fields—and these works have been collected by the editor over many years in various aspects.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into seven sections, each explaining how to start exploring a certain subject. The first section is on the purpose and method of learning; the second section is on how we should learn Chinese; the third section is on how we should learn mathematics; the fourth section is on how we should learn English; the fifth section is on how we should learn natural sciences; the sixth section is on how we should learn history and geography; and the seventh section is on how we should learn drawing and music.</p>
<p>The first section, "The Purpose and Method of Learning," contains six articles on being a person and "seeking knowledge," and each article contains precise enlightenment. This section can be regarded as the introduction to the entire book. "Learning and Being a Person" is a piece of literature full of philosophy. It answers the questions of "why study" and "the meaning of studying and being a person" very thoroughly. "Why Study and How to Study" and "Methods and Materials for Learning" comprehensively and thoroughly reveal the necessary preparatory steps for studying and the results of research by scholars from the East and West over the past sixty years on different materials. In a section of "Why Study and How to Study," the explanation of "learning" and "student" is particularly precise. It says,</p>
<p>"If humanity has no learning, humanity cannot survive. If humanity has no learning, humanity has no need to survive—a world that never evolves, barren and monotonous, what pleasure is there in living in it? Therefore, I say, one must learn throughout life, and learning is life."</p>
<p>The second section, "How We Should Learn Chinese," also contains six works by experts in Chinese studies. The first four articles explain the research methods and basic knowledge of writing in Chinese studies. The last two articles list a reading list for learners.</p>
<p>The third section, "How We Should Learn Mathematics," explains the function of mathematics and its relationship to human life, as well as the habit of "seeking truth" that should be cultivated when studying mathematics, and the methods of entry. It contains an article "A Path to Instructing Young People in the Study of Geometry," which dissects the meaning of geometry and the theorems of deduction especially finely. The last article is "Introducing Several Excellent Arithmetic Books to Middle School Students," with a list of thirty-five kinds, all of which are practical arithmetic textbooks.</p>
<p>The fourth section, "How We Should Learn English," here, there is only one article, "Methods of Learning English," and "Introducing Twenty Kinds of English Magazines." However, regarding the grammar, reading, spelling, writing, and necessary books for beginners in English, there is already very detailed guidance.</p>
<p>The fifth section, "How We Should Learn Natural Sciences," explains the interest aroused by studying natural sciences, and the methods of learning natural sciences and experimentation. This section has five articles, precise discussions, all of which are works by experts in science.</p>
<p>The sixth section, "How We Should Learn History and Geography," this section has detailed descriptions of the concept of history, the collection of historical materials, and research methods. "Historical Research Methods" can especially correct and reform general old history studies, with detailed concerns about the tendencies taken by new history studies. The important relationship between geography and humanity, and the steps of learning, and the definition of geography, are also explained very thoroughly.</p>
<p>The seventh section, "How We Should Learn Drawing and Music," here there are five works. It clearly reveals to us the meaning of art, and the happiness and pleasure it gives to humanity, and the foundation of preparation, one by one, so that readers naturally develop a love of art.</p>
<p>This book meets the needs of middle school students and is a major contribution to the academic community. Friends who are determined to study, this is a shortcut to learning that the editor, Mr. Fan, has newly opened up for you.</p>

<h3 id="e207">French General Foch's War Diaries <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The sixteenth was calm and uneventful. The German attack failed the day before yesterday, and there can be no good development now. On the Xiangben front, the German offensive has reached the end of its strength.</p>
<p>South of the Marne River, the enemy army failed to deploy the defense line guarding the bridgehead. What the enemy army encountered was not only stubborn defense, but also the fierce counterattack of the French Sixth Army, preventing enemy troops everywhere, and even recapturing several important towns. If our artillery and air force continue to bombard the Marne River bridges, making it difficult for the enemy to resupply reinforcements and ammunition, the bottom of the enemy's pocket-shaped position in the Thierry area will inevitably fall into danger.</p>
<p>The only progress the enemy army made on the sixteenth was southwest of Reims, between the Vesle River and the Marne River, especially along the Marne River. However, this progress was local and insignificant to the overall situation, and it was difficult to advance further at the cost of great sacrifices.</p>
<p>After using two days of strength in the hope of salvaging the uncertain gains on the Marne River, there was no result. The German High Command must be hesitant. The enemy once shouted, "Fight and win to see peace again." What is the result? Nothing but resentment, deceit, and a harbinger of failure. The morale of the entire army will inevitably be greatly affected by this.</p>
<p>On July 17, the German army was already in a slump. On the 18th, the allied artillery bombarded like thunder at the predetermined time and place.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, as early as June, I had noticed the importance of Soissons to the enemy army, because its location is a railway center, which is absolutely indispensable for the supply of the deep and isolated army in the Thierry area. Its location is not far from our front line. Taking an offensive towards this city, preparations have now begun according to my plans of June 14 and June 16. Commander Mangin's operational plan was also completed on June 20. Since that time, I have thought that the result of our army's counterattack, shifting from west to east, must be greater than merely disrupting the enemy's transportation.</p>
<p>Commander Mangin then gradually expanded his plan to include the fifteen-mile area from his defense line on the Aisne River to the point where he connects with the left wing of the French Sixth Army on the Ourcq River. His forces were also increased to eighteen infantry divisions (including the American First and Second Divisions), three cavalry divisions, two hundred and forty 75mm guns, two hundred and thirty-one heavy guns, forty-one air squadrons, and three hundred and seventy-five tanks.</p>
<p>Commander Degoutte of the Sixth Army reported that he would extend the Tenth Army to the right, and the planned battle would extend to the other side of the Ourcq River. He could also operate in the same way. He had already drafted a plan for the Sixth Army to launch another offensive along the Ourcq-Clignon line, with the Tenth Army attacking on its left wing. He wanted a tank unit and one or two infantry divisions under his command. After the increase in forces, he had a total of eight divisions of troops for combat. The offensive line could be expanded by sixteen miles.</p>
<p>On July 9, I also thought of the Fifth Army launching a simultaneous offensive westward on the line from Reims to the Marne River. However, since that time, the situation of the Fifth Army has changed, and it can now only undertake secondary military tasks.</p>
<p>At that time, the bases from which the Tenth and Sixth Armies set out had greatly improved after several wars. West of Soissons, the Tenth Army had established a position on the plateau from Cœuvres to Dommiers. Further south, the Tenth Army had seized the two villages of Longpont and Corcy, which are adjacent to the Retz Forest. Its vanguard had advanced east of the Savières stream. West of Thierry, the Sixth Army recaptured several important towns, such as the villages of Vaux. The American Second Division performed very well.</p>
<p>In order to salvage the critical situation, the German High Command had obviously divided its army into two parts, one to guard the western war zone and the other to seize new territory to the south. The forces of the two parts were not very equal to each other.</p>
<p>When the German army's general offensive failed and it was in a slump, the prospects for our army's counterattack and the achievements already made were roughly like this. (To be continued)</p>
