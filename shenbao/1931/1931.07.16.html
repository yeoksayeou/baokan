<p>— 海客</p>
<p>唇的研究</p>
<p>德國有一位大學敎授。對於人類的嘴唇。曾作科學上的深切的研究。據他說。每一個人的嘴唇的構造。與他的性格頗有連帶的關係。不但有關性格。并且也有關於職業。譬如電話公司中一般接線的女子。伊們往往有充實而極柔軟的嘴唇。吐出來的聲音。也字字着實。極其清楚。世界上凡是愚魯與野蠻的人種。他們的嘴唇都是極厚的。那些赫赫有名的大思想家。都生着極薄的唇。然而有幾處文化閉塞智識未開的野蠻人種。他們的嘴唇也是薄薄的。所以世界之大無奇不有。即如嘴唇一項。也有不能一概而論的。</p>
<p>恒河的水</p>
<p>印度人稱他們的恒河Ganges爲聖河。恒河中的水。也睢作仙水一樣。喝了是有益於人體的。所以一般善男信女。都以一飲仙水爲快。最近由科學家加以試騐。發見河中的黴菌。確有殺死好多種的病菌的能力。瞧那河水的渾濁。明明是不衛生的。誰知竟有這種特别的黴菌。使那些科學家大爲懷疑。加爾吉他的熱帶藥劑學校曾細加研究。據說倘將這種黴菌用人工繁殖起來。將來可作醫病之用。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>本巿各界。因鮮民屠殺華僑。慘無人道。於本月十三日。假上海市商會開會。討論對付方法。</p>
<p>會場一瞥　大門口高懸黨國旗。武裝保衛團分站左右。狀甚嚴肅。會場在二樓議事廳。門口設簽到處。簽名後。各贈旅滬鮮帮同人哀告全國各界同胞印刷品一張。上刋「慘不忍聞的鮮人仇華」。「危險萬狀的僑胞境况」。「慘酷的殺戮丨丨剖心挖目」。「危險的横暴丨丨焚毁搶刦」。「避難山積的僑胞幾將絶糧」。「日見惡烈的情勢岌岌可危」等標題。令人不忍卒讀。</p>
<p>各種標語　此次鮮民暴動。完全日人主使。故是日場内外所貼標語。均係對日。摘錄如下。「萬寳山案件是日人預先的隂謀」。「要求政府厲行革命外交」。「萬寳山案件是日人出兵東北的藉口」。「同胞奮起滅此朝日」。「萬寳山案件是日人侵略滿蒙的先聲」。「國難巳至同胞快醒」。「各界一致起來對日。爲外交後盾」。「以沉毅勇猛之精神。永遠對日經濟絶交」。</p>
<p>痛哭流涕　旅日華僑楊君報告日人對華隂謀。操粤語。甚憤激謂旅日十餘年。平素與日人交接。知其處心積慮以對中國。隂狠手段。一言難盡。鮮人素屈服於日本積威之下。尋常一舉一動。謹守範圍。不敢踰越。惟日人馬首是瞻。此次大暴動。苟無日人主使。鮮民斷無如是膽量。言時以手作勢。并痛哭流涕而勸各界同胞一致猛醒。否則日人得步進步。其害不堪設想。聽者動容。</p>
<p>大聲疾呼　對荷外交後援會總幹事林肯有壬君演說時。謂中國地大物博。人民衆多。與區區三島之日本相比。奚啻霄壤。今日人如是暴横。目中巳無中國。如再忍受。不謀對付。不啻全國民心巳死。哀莫大於心死。今日之事。名雖鮮民排華。實即日人謀華。鮮民爲日傀儡。應矜其無知識而爲人利用。擒賊擒王。須以全力對付日本。并列舉日人自袁氏稱帝時。提出二十一條件後種種對華劣績。以手擊桌者再。大聲疾呼。激昻慷慨。令人興奮。</p>

<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>客有自嶺南曲江來者。爲述其地産有響尾蛇。蛇甚毒。長七八尺。尾端有環狀物。能發聲。嘒嘒如夏柳之鳴蟬。喜啖荔枝。蜿蜒樹間。纍纍者缅刻而盡。日啖荔枝三百顆。坡老猶輸其口福也。某年。荔枝熟時。是蛇特多。園主引以爲憂。乃爭飼鶴以殲之。鶴爲之盡。無可羅致。有以紙糊鶴狀以守護荔枝者。鶴啖蛇。冠頂丹紅似。血毒所藴聚焉。某僮不察。手觸及之。頓時腫發腕肘。徧延全軀而死。其矣。響尾蛇之毒也。蛇之出也。必於夜間。客備獵槍一。宵深聞蛇鳴。欣然推枕而起。出跡其聲而槍射之。雖昏黑莫可辨别。然翌晨往視。輒見委地而僵者若干尾。蓋客固素嫺槍法。故什八九能命中也。客談及此。軒眉攘臂。大有當年泗上亭長斬白帝子之氣概云。</p>

<p>梅蘭芳此次南行。光隂容易。幾三閱月矣。其初膺南天之聘。珠海遄征。兩演於港粤。萬人空巷。不减當年。蓋自美洲歸來。尚爲第一次與南方民衆相聚首也。其過滬之際。留滄洲旅館者二日。在港粤前後三十日。又乘暇一赴中山縣。謁翠亭鄉。游共樂園。覘此模範縣之建置政績焉。旣以杜氏宗祠典禮。趲程參加。演劇者三日。并以月笙先生有設圖書館。嘉惠士林之宏願。特由粤購覓廣雅叢書精梓本全集五百册。贈以實之。梅固醇雅。敦學媚古。一以觀杜氏堂構之盛。一以昌惠流澤沛之心。兩足嘉巳。來滬即由杜氏招待寓中央旅社。演劇旣畢。本定北歸。徒以曩者南行。無不倚裝草草。迄未得少覘江南山水之勝。用爲恨事。適有知友相約。共作聖湖餘杭之游。遂與張嘯林杜月笙兩君。及汪胡諸君子。同作杭行。留數日。以長途汽車抵莫干山。差盡其勝。一繞而轉程餘杭。至東西天目。遍窮林壑。宿廟中三日。且敬謹繪佛像。留紀念。資供養。檀越浮屠。皆大歡喜。龍象威儀之盛。殊罕覯矣。杭州歸來。天巳盛暑。不可留。而海上諸大善士。以江西被災孔亟。圖集欵以振之。滬上警備司令熊天翼氏。亦自江西營次來電。敦請爲贛人圖存。梅固痌瘝在抱。聞而惻然。立允。於是復演於大舞臺者三日。售票三萬金。炎天酷熱。無座不滿。花樓百元。而三樓至一元許。則空前所未有。固海上人士。赴義之篤。亦梅氏號召之力。有以致之也。梅氏年事方剛。而扮相之韶秀。不减十年以前。嗓音則愈清挺。愈耐聽。高唱入雲。無幾微勉强之處。内行以爲至此日而嗓音如是。則且終其身以不變。是殊爲顧曲協律者之幸事矣。輟演次日。屏當行事。怱遽上道。因最其行程爲短札。告知好。兼爲秋後重來歡迎之劵。</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>朝鮮人所最感慘痛的。便是二十餘年來受日本經濟勢力的高壓。到如今·除了少數貴族及資産階級以外。最大多數的民衆。無一不感到生活的艱難。全國經濟實力。完全在日人掌握之中。憑你有什麽本領。都不能解除這種束縛。雖不是天然的形成。巳非人力所能挽回。唉丶亡國的慘禍。韓人至今才明白是切膚之痛。然而後悔無及了。朝鮮人的生産能力。也薄弱得可憐。在城巿裏竟看不見他們自巳創辦的一家大公司丶大商業丶或是大工廠。在漢城的朝鮮街。只見小營業。販賣手工製造的家常用具。店舖資本滿千元以上的。並不多觀。熱鬧的商塲。繁華的街巿。大資本的營業。完全集中於日本街。就是中國街。商業也很清淡。都是受了日本經濟侵略的影響。倘是形容朝鮮人受經濟壓迫的狀態。好比一個病入膏盲的人一樣。危在旦夕。現在急須良醫施用手術。從根本上去救治。</p>
<p>韓人的風尚·習俗。到還是保守。没有給日本人同化。譬如衣·食·住·行·四大需要。除行以外。都依賴他們自巳的供給。韓人最特别的風尚。就是一年四季。都穿白色的衣服。男子老幼。彼此一律。有人說這不但是他們的風尚。也含有「毋忘國恥」的意思。男人穿的長衫。胸前對襟相合。有兩條帶扣結。白布襪。橡皮鞋。老年人還加上一頂黑笠。女性穿的裙子很長。而衫僅及腰際。也是胸襟對合。扣一個結。中年以上的婦人。再裏一方白布頭巾。衣料大都是棉織白布。夏天是麻布。時髦的婦女。才用白絹綢。穿日本和服足登木屐的極少。智識階級也有穿西裝的。看他們在服飾上並不講究。而且衣料的來源。多半是土産。韓國農産物。以米爲大宗。每年巨額的米糧。大部分出口運往日本。他們自巳的食糧。反而仰給於東三省的小米。所以在我國遼·吉黑·三省耕植的韓農。收穫的五榖。每年運回朝鮮。爲數着實可觀。朝鮮焑酒兩項。是歸總督府專賣的。韓人對此嗜好很深。因此消耗很大。在日人心目中。認爲烟酒的贏餘及捐稅。是一項極大的收入。講到朝鮮人的住居問題。到很值得研究的。試從日本馬關渡對馬海峽。而至朝鮮釜山登陸。乘火車一直到新義州爲止。一日夜可以穿過朝鮮半島。路旁農村的景象。似乎非常蕭條。民間房屋。盡是矮小的茅廬。泥土或蘆編的墻壁。偶然看見幾所白墻瓦屋。據說是日本人的住宅。住瓦屋的人。以大地主資本家爲多。他們在農村裏濳勢力很大。彷彿握有指揮普通農民的特權。可知日人的勢力。巳經深入腹地。擴張到民間去了。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>於是一年硯台上，墨也乾了，再磨起來，打算繼續工作；不料戲台上十八扯似的夫人，又上樓來了。子良看時，不免有些奇怪，原來伊雙手抱着一個小孩子，自己對丈夫兀是好笑。</p>
<p>「你看！這孩子好不好？」</p>
<p>結婚三年没有孩子的子良，當真好奇心發了：</p>
<p>「這是誰的？」</p>
<p>「哈哈！這是我的兒子，你不認得麽？」</p>
<p>夫人說着，把孩子的面孔，旋向子良。</p>
<p>「好孩子，你呌他一聲爸爸！」</p>
<p>子良細看了小孩子的面孔，曉得這好像是隔壁汪家的。</p>
<p>「笑話！爸爸會不認得兒子。」</p>
<p>夫人說着，坐在椅上，解開自巳胸襟，露出左乳來，把乳頭塞到小孩子口中：</p>
<p>「好孩子！你吃罷！」</p>
<p>子良看了夫人這種舉動，實在有些可笑；不料其時小孩子吃不到乳，他哭起來了，而且是放聲大哭，子良忍不住：</p>
<p>「人家的孩子，你去抱來做什麽？他哭了！快抱去還了罷！否則被他們聽得了，怕不答應罷！」</p>
<p>夫人也覺得無法可施。雖是用手在書桌邊上，閣閣閣的敲着，小孩子的哭，依然不止，只得抱着他下樓，大門上巳經有叩門聲了。</p>

<p>昨日粉巿上午開盤曾疲軟丶以洋麥報價互有上落丶比較反小近角丶北路諸帮以現銷不佳丶曾有回出丶廠方近期微有收進丶預備直裝各口岸丶遠期則套出十萬左右丶巿氣遂平定丶迨至下午因又見陣雨丶内地帮人心不佳丶本地投機者丶乘勢搶進丶致近遠期又復俏俐丶觀察後步丶實銷雖清淡丶惟内地帮終以價到底盤丶尚須堅擯不懈也丶結果本月份較前日好七釐半丶八九月份好五釐丶十月份好一分丶十一月份好七釐半丶十二月份好一分二釐半云丶</p>

<p>現貨去化不暢</p>
<p>昨日期麥巿面呈初平繼堅之象丶以洋麥報價丶芝加哥小二三角丶坎拿大則好起一角零丶一部份人心丶多趨觀望丶旋因金巿復高丶多數人心理丶以爲洋麥將因合價不划丶無從着手丶内地帮終以水災關係丶决不顧輕易放鬆丶所以巿氣又步盤步俏丶但現來去化丶依然不暢丶標準一時甚難過昻也丶結果本月份較前日好一分丶八九月份大二分丶七月份大三分丶十一月份大四分丶十二月份大二分丶現麥巿面丶仍然平定丶高貨站在五錢關口丶中次則二三錢不等丶開崑山·丹陽·奔牛·石浦·望仙橋·蓬萊麥共二千四百餘包丶由華豐福新辦去云丶</p>

<p>四日下午三時丶召集全部領江人員丶開會討論丶增加領江費問題丶其理由丶以金價飛漲丶生活程度日高丶以世界各國比較丶中國領江費爲最短丶請求各輪公司丶照現定之費丶酌加百分之二十丶例如五百兩一次丶增至六百兩丶由公會向輪公司方面丶提出要求丶</p>
<h3 id="c239">輪方不允 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>領江費之收取丶其定例不能直接向輪局收欵丶須由公會開具收據丶再送并上海領事團·英商會·與江海關·等三機關丶會同簽字以後丶方可向輪公司收欵丶歷來手續如此丶今次領江人員要求加費丶亦須照此辦法丶先向領團英商會等通過丶方能有效丶昨聞領團與英商會對此增費案丶表示不予同意丶故各輪公司丶亦遂一致拒絶丶</p>
<h3 id="c240">臨時怠工 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>十四日下午三時起丶各領江爲參加會議起見丶即停止工作丶對於歐美日本各地來滬之船丶到吳淞後丶均未往引水進口丶故被其阻滯者丶有外洋輪八隻丶及至昨日上午丶各領江遵照公會命令丶以條件巳提出丶乃照常恢復工作丶所有被阻在吳淞之英輪雪佛波麥·平爾大·德輪亞杜等丶午刻由各領江帶引進口丶巳在照常卸貨丶出口船昨亦開出丶前後被阻十餘時丶</p>
<h3 id="c241">磋議所聞 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>昨午丶記者特赴該公會訪問一切丶而該公會對此事嚴守秘密丶謂會中西人知照丶未便告知丶乃未得要領丶記者復至各輪局探詢一切丶輪公司方面丶對於領江公會所取之態度丶亦不十分明瞭丶但據所聞丶如果今日無滿意答復丶領江人員丶將有最嚴重之斷然處置丶恐届時將引起輪舶阻滯進出浦江也丶</p>
<h3 id="c242">輪方態度 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>記者復又向各方探詢輪公司之主張丶大致對於增費丶亦不能遽允增加丶蓋須由三機關同意也丶萬一領江人員取斷然主張丶則輪公司方面丶亦議定一種補救方策丶在事未實現之時丶未可揭示丶但其辦法丶係維持輪船丶不使阻停爲主丶</p>

<p>中國商輪丶向來自雇領江人員丶不論長江南北洋船丶各船均有領江派定丶故此次外洋領江之發生風潮丶即使實現罷工丶與華輪絶無妨碍丶</p>
<p>大晚報云丶關於引水費改訂問題丶今晨（十五）海關總稅務司曾召集河泊司與巡工司丶有重要之討論丶將午始畢丶内容無從探悉丶據聞引水協會要求今後引水費改用金幣計數丶而用銀兩實付丶上海規銀一兩丶最少折合一先令八便士丶最大折合二先令三便士丶按照新價比現行價約增百分之二十丶又聞目下領有執照之引水丶每月收入約一千三百兩丶除去各項費用外丶可實得九百兩丶至船公司態度丶則因目下營業不振丶皆認尚非增費時期云丶</p>

<h3 id="c301">一輛塌車 <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 德人</p>
<p>時巳近正午了、赤炎炎的太陽、閃閃地滿照着一條大路、路上的行人、都辛勞地急切地走着、忽然、在轉灣口現出一輛裝滿磚瑕的塌車、前面有四個人拉着、後面有一個人推着、可是、因爲這條新建築的、築得不甚堅固的柏油路、被熱烈显的陽光、晒得有些軟了、重載的車行過、時時有一條條的輪痕印在上面、在這拉這輛電車的人、剛要使勁的拉過這轉灣口的時候、這車忽的不能推動了、</p>
<p>拉這車的苦力、似乎覺得很吃力、沉重的呼聲、時時的從他們張開着的嘴裏發出、一夥夥的熱汗、在他們油滑的背上、直掛下來、他們繼續着、仍努力的往前推、但是車輪好似巳黏着了地的、一動不動、路上的行人、見了這欲前不得前的這輛車、都淡淡的斜着眼望了一望、仍自管自的、急急的去了、</p>
<p>没幾時、遠遠地走來一個十多歲的店夥模樣的孩子、一手拿着一隻碗、一手拿了十數銅元、他很自得地、頑皮地把銅元在碗的邊上敲、一邊從口中發出懶懶的哼聲、不諧和地和入了銅元擊在碗邊上的聲響、</p>
<p>他慢慢地一步行近一步、最後、停在塌車的面前、好奇地望着這幾個很疲乏的苦力的拉、</p>
<p>「我來幫助你們一手、怎的這輛車一動都不動、」這孩子放下了碗和銅錢、自信地嘻笑着幫着他們在車後用力的推、但是他是孩子、一個孩子的氣力、任憑他是怎樣的强大、到底是有限、比不上大人們的、他雖把頭俯得低低的全力的推着、可是車輛仍不動、</p>
<p>這時塌車的周圍、巳圍了好幾個五六歲光景的小孩子了、</p>
<p>「大家來、幫忙幫忙、這車的車輪、似乎黏住在柏油裏了、」這幫着那些苦力推的孩子、見自巳終究是無用的、就大喊着别人去幫助、</p>
<p>天氣是這般的悶熱、太陽光是這般的强烈、半裸着身、不停地揮着扇子、還似乎不凉、誰高興再用了力、來幫這幾個與我不相干的苦力的忙、而使自巳意外地流些寃枉汗呢、</p>
<p>小孩子是好動的、所以那幾個圍在塌車旁的小孩、見没有人前來幫助、就伸伸手、不自量地哄着去幫忙了、可是、不識好意的這幾個苦力、倒反無情地把他們斥住了手、</p>
<p>「謝謝你們、幫我們推一推好嗎、」這幾個没奈何的苦力、央求着路旁店中的、安閒地坐着的揮着扇的店夥、和穿短衣的、露着流汗的胸的過路人、</p>
<p>「誰高興費了力替你們推、」我在猜想那幾個冷眼旁觀的店夥、大概在心中這樣想着、因爲、從他們不動心的、老是一動不動的容態上、可以看見這神色、而且、呵、他們淡淡然生着一動不動的工夫、真好極了、若不是他們在揮着扇子的手在動、眼珠在流轉、我或會想他們是巳死了的、是巳冷了、是巳殭了的、</p>
<p>徼幸得很、一陣嘰嘰格格的聲音、幾輛載着人的黄包車來了、黄包車夫一見塌車擋住了自巳的去路、就大聲的呼斥的、後來、他們知道了他們的呼斥是無用的、就板着臉咕噥着、幫着這幾個苦力、用力的往前推了、</p>
<p>幾個黄包車夫的力、可真不小、經他們用力的幾推、車輪先微微的動了、接着、咶的一聲、車輪滑過了、拉這塌車的苦力、面上立刻浮出歡樂的笑客、對黄包車夫微微的點了幾點頭、揚長的去了、</p>
<p>這時、圍在車旁的小孩子、都帶跳帶跑的哄着去玩了、那個幫着苦力推而推不動的孩子、也漸地走遠了、一路敲着碗的邊、隨意地哼着、再有路旁店中櫃台旁的店夥、仍安閒地坐着、無聊地、冷冷地望着一個行人的流汗的面、……一切的情狀、和以前一樣、祗日光照遍着的轉灣口、多了一個車輪的痕、</p>

<h3 id="c303">世界靴王—貝泰 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 富蘭</p>
<p>一位鄉村補鞋匠的兒子、當他父親挑着担、一家一家上門兜攬生意的時候、誰會料得也兒子在今日、足令英美的實業界、退避三舍呢、</p>
<p>他是湯姆斯貝泰、（Thomas　Bata）是捷克斯拉夫國摩拉維亞省的慈林人、也就是當今世界的靴王、</p>
<p>不論貝泰幹的感想的是什麽、在足以影響英國北桑浦敦及雷賽司得和美國造靴諸城鎮的巿面、因爲他與世界靴業的關係這般大、所以他的計畫、每由各國領事署爭相作成報告、寄給十二國國家、貝泰目下的概况、可以簡括地一說如下、</p>
<p>他有一千萬鎊的財産、</p>
<p>他擁有世界最大的製靴工廠、雇用一萬七千名工人、</p>
<p>他有零售店二千家、</p>
<p>他每日的出品、現今巳超過十三萬五千雙、</p>
<p>上面一切的成功、都是他在十年以内得到的、</p>
<p>今日英國方面售給婦女的廉價皮鞋、一大半是由貝泰的廠中供給、新近他又簽訂了一份合同、答應供給一家英國公司二百萬雙的皮鞋、最近他又飛到柏林、商量一批定價、就是運五百萬雙皮鞋到美國、</p>
<p>不論什麽時候、他旅行歐洲或在本國内移動、他都乘自置的飛機、用自巳的機師、因爲「時者金也」、所以他不能用火車或汽船來旅行、</p>
<p>說起貝泰本人、乃是一位强壯的努力的村夫、但是他有腦筋、和不可測度的想像力、</p>
<p>他坐在慈林的辦公房裏、面前放着一個旋轉的地球儀、他就把所想到要推銷貝泰皮靴的地方、加以表記、凡是有了他表記的所在、必須要由他的推銷機關達到目的、否則他必要仔細明白不能達到目的的理由、</p>
<p>在他的寫字檯旁、還裝着一架信號燈、這個信號、就是用以表示在他自巳設立的四十家工廠之中、是那一家這時正在需要他本人的親臨、</p>
<p>他一見着信號、便即應召而往、他具有這般專門的技巧、所以能把各種失了常軌的機器、使之回復原狀、或是指示那些工頭們、什麽事件應當那樣地去幹、</p>
<p>在慈林、一切工作的效能、真是達到十足的程度、爲任何英國廠家所未嘗夢見、再就慈林地方而論、也真是一座奇異的城鎮、在常人眼光看來、　實在没有成爲重要實業區的可能、因爲附近没有煤、没有水道交通、没有鐵道、除了一條支路、四週都是亂山、這無異一段最惡劣的所在、誰都想像　决不能成爲實業化的、</p>
<p>假使你乘了火車漫游、經過那邊的鄉村、你就可見到那邊耕地的工人、依舊借重着牛力、墨守古代的習慣、然後你就可見到慈林那邊是一座新式工廠的城鎮、闊大的馬路、美麗的建築、一切都是利用光、空氣、和電力、</p>
<p>四十座的工廠、一排一排地聳峙在草地和濃蔭夾道的馬路後面、工廠的四週、都是小山、和工人們住的公寓和宿舍、貝泰的所以要使慈林成爲工廠中心、他的着眼點、全在工資低廉、因爲摩拉維亞省鄉村低廉的勞力、真是供給無窮、他便拿來吸收牠、訓練牠、和利用牠、</p>
<p>不論英國人或美國人、决難站住在貝泰的巨量生産及工資的制度上面、不想摩拉維亞一個小小的村莊、竟有這般的成績、</p>
<p>每位男子或婦女、在他偉大的工廠裏工作、必須按照一個生産標準做事、他們每人每天必須做「這般多、」假使他們不這般做、或不能這般做、那便是他們的工資悔氣、</p>
<p>在廠裏製造皮靴、正和製造汽車一般、就是用分段工作、—移轉制度、男女工人、做完各人的工作、轉入接收員之手、必須合於規定的標準、否則就要受罰、</p>
<p>至於工資一層、比起英國來、當然是很低、但是比起捷克全國任何城鎮的低廉工資、那就好得多丁、平均女工每週做工四十五小時、可得工資十五先令、但是她住的是貝泰替她預備的宿舍、跳舞的是貝泰替她預備的廳堂、吃喝的是貝泰替她預備的餐館、娱樂的是貝泰替她預備的電影院、同時一切食用物品的購買、有貝泰爲她開設的商店、最後她還把她的儲蓄、交與貝泰、收受利息、</p>
<p>這些就是貝泰成功的秘密、他替巿民佈置全鎮的享樂設備、同時他們就從所得工資裏、拿出錢來償付他設備的代價、</p>
<p>據計算所得、每逢星期三、所有上星期所發工人工資的全部的六成半、巳都經由貝泰開設的公寓、餐室、商店之手、面回到貝泰的囊中了、</p>
<p>他在本鎮、不論建築什麽東西、都用他自巳的工人、他自巳控制造靴的一應手續、自硝皮開始、一直到製成一雙完全的靴爲止、他造自巳的紙盒、自巳的包紙、和用十二種不同的文字、印刷自巳的目錄、</p>
<p>他在工廠四週所造的房子、也是一般的考究房子—每星期只需房租三先令、如果一位單身男子或女子、可以每週出一先令的代價、住他的宿舍、至於食、最佳的一頓飯、在他餐館裏只需五辦士、進電影院的代價、只需一辦士、</p>
<p>所以一位女郎、她每週雖只十五先令的進項、但她可以出十先令的代價、很舒服的度七天的生活、比起她在山村田間作工、每週只有八先令的進益、真要好得多了、</p>
<p>每件東西、凡是工人所需要的、從一頂帽子到一輛機器脚踏車、都是由鎮上貝泰的百貨商店出售、</p>
<p>鎮上最精緻的建築物、要推工人俱樂部了、裏面有運動塲、有游泳池、有十分得力的醫院、貝泰自巳却住在一所樸實無華的别墅、比起工人俱樂部來、未免相形見絀了、</p>
<p>貝泰制度的特點、就是每一單獨單位、必須要賺牠的贏餘、甚至在醫院裏、</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>也是一般地要付錢的、如果任何一部分裏遭受損失、他就减少那一部分工人的工資、總之一句話、他們是共同的負責共同的獲利、共同的損失、</p>
<p>凡是住在貝泰宿舍裏的人、都要有規則地生活着、他們必須早上五時半起身、起身之後、必須舉行體操、而七時必須在廠中工作、</p>
<p>他們必須這般那般的利用他們晚上的餘暇光隂、他們必須夜間九時安寢、他們在工作時、不准吸烟、也不准飲酒、</p>
<p>他們必須就進項下儲蓄一部分、當他們簽定工作契約的時候、他們必須將個人的一切詳細情形、連帶叙明、—像關於他們的債務·資産·和家庭概况等等、而貝泰之於他們、乃是他們的主人、他們的國王、和他們的世界、</p>
<p>貝泰廠中出來的皮靴、乃是世界上最低廉的貨品、但是價格雖廉、而貨色極好、所以銷路一天發達一天、他的事業、無一日不在發展之中、他目下—假使需要降臨—每天可以製造二十萬雙的皮靴、合英國著名出靴地方—北桑浦敦—大小工廠的每日生産量、還趕他不上、</p>
<p>他正有計畫獻給他的政府、照此計畫進行、在一九四○年以前、可以使慈林成爲一座十萬人口的大鎮、</p>
<p>他是製造皮靴的、但他計畫製造别的東西、也正和製造皮靴一般地好、他特創的制度、是没有倫理止境的、他比亨利福特及威廉馬立司、還要來得完善、</p>
<p>貝泰同了他的腦筋的不能控制的努力、從中歐飛越到世界、他專們訓練青年男女、在他工廠裏的執行人員、極少有年齡大過二十五歲的、</p>
<p>他到底要達到什麽境界、他在十年中、積下一千萬鎊資財、他的年紀、目下還只五十五、</p>

<p>孟買訊、印度去年度之各國棉布輸入、因繼續國民運動、採取保護政策、較前年度、齊行减少、同時印度紗廠頗形發展、計去年一年間紗廠錠數擴張三十一萬八千錠、（中國二十萬六千錠、日本三十五萬四千錠、）尤其於去年七月至本年一月底間、其發展狀况、於遠東紗廠中、尤出一頭地、試比較列表如下、（單位千錠）</p>

<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>頃刻之間完成作戰計劃、分散的兵力也能使之一致行動、久經壕溝戰的、惯於較緩的步驟、見之不免詫異、有人對於這役的結果發生懷疑、因有許多軍事家認爲孟琴司令以五師之衆、要在十二日以前採取攻勢、似乎是不可能的、</p>
<p>至於我呢、我主張趕快反攻、敵人未有從容佈防的機會、我軍便可攻其措手不及、倘使我軍在十二日始行反攻、敵人必在十一日巳準備好了、</p>
<p>孟琴司令的堅决態度及其觀察清晣、卒使福悅司令信服、他因在十日下午四時下令、限各軍十一日實行進攻、軍令發交全軍士卒、最後有下面的幾句話、「我軍採取守勢戰巳有兩個多月、明日的進曰爲守勢戰的終了、這役將爲德軍困頓及我軍恢復攻勢的開端、不奏凱歌誓不還、三軍健兒其共喻之、」</p>
<p>我軍果於次日十一日上午十一時開始進攻、一戰之下、便把瑪璃村及白樂村相繼克復、至龍河流域亦告肅清、擒獲俘虜千餘人、大砲若干尊、</p>
<p>十二日、我在香鐵里與貝當司令商定、孟琴司令的進攻須見機而止、以免得不償失、現在更須補充餘部以防萬一、例如沙姆河方面敵軍的危險尚未盡去、</p>
<p>大戰停頓了、六月十四日稍有局部衝突、敵方在十一日佔據梅兹河左岸、以鞏固防綫、疴亞斯河以西的攻擊、便完全停止了、</p>
<p>敵軍停頓於疴亞斯河之西、可認爲向河東大舉進攻的準備、因在次日六月十二日、德軍二三師之衆、向費勒高特勒森林之北猛攻、喀特里及杜米爾相繼失守、法軍向高夫爾及聖皮爾愛格爾退即、但這仍不過是局部衝突、敵軍也並未追擊、</p>
<p>六月十三日、法軍全綫又歸平靜、</p>
<p>德軍今次準備的一戰、實即五月二十七日開始實行的作戰計劃的一部、這次戰事在開始的時候目的在於沿着里姆和孟鐵第歐間全綫進攻、只因缺乏重砲及迫擊砲德軍遂不得立即施行全綫總攻、所能進行的不過兩處戰事、一即疴亞斯河之東、五月二十七日實行的喜明河的進攻、一即將在河西發生的衝突、第二戰非待用在第一戰的砲隊調到不能進行、</p>
<p>但第二戰裏德軍不能再得着像第一戰裏的優勢匆匆忙忙的作戰使他們勿略了五月二十七日進攻中詳細的預防、他們的新計劃因之立被法軍航空隊及間牒偵悉、五月三十日、貝當司令巳洞悉敵人的作戰計劃了、不明白的只有一點、就是敵人兵力的多寡、推想起來、敵人兵力當很雄厚、因根據法軍參謀部的計算、德軍最高司令有後備軍大約六十師、在疴亞斯河及沙姆河之間採取攻勢的不下四十五師之衆、多於五月二十七日進攻喜明河的人數、無論如何、一定大大的超過我軍可以調用的全部兵力、</p>
<p>實則、擔任這次戰事的德國第十八軍（軍長霍體爾）配置在第一綫的不過十三師、戰綫長及二十一哩、對面的法軍、在第一綫的有第三軍的七師之衆（軍長亨包特）、在第二綫或爲後備的五師、結集在蒲代亞和聖里間後方的尚有步兵七師和騎兵三師、也好作爲援兵、</p>
<p>在開戰的時候、要遏制德軍的攻擊、這些兵力當然是不夠、但在開戰前幾天裏、形勢的推移尚未大定、我軍不得不爲將來準備、</p>
<p>六月四日、我遂警告海格指揮、「假使敵人在馬爾納河與疴亞斯河之間繼續向巴黎進行、或假使他把戰線展開、丨例如、在鐵里别墅及孟鐵第歐之間、丨法境聯軍必須全體助戰、這役式將决定大戰的命運、」我請他詳細準備、把他所有的餘部、總預備隊·以及獨立後備隊、掃數調往前敵、且須考慮抽調他前方的軍隊、英軍總司令部因之發生誤會、</p>
<p>海格總指揮前巳奉令調兵三師第二十二軍團、開往亞眠之西沙姆河方面、他同時仍恐怕敵軍要在雷斯河及沙姆河之間進攻、（註、六月四日、巴伐里亞太子餘部計有四十九師、其中二十六師爲生力兵、）遂正式抗議、反對再抽調英軍部隊、他根據蒲代亞協定、向本國政府申訴</p>
<p>六月七日、在巴黎内閣總理公署召集會議、出席的是克萊孟沙君、米爾納侯爵、海格總指揮、威爾遜司令、勞倫斯司令、魏肯司令、及我自巳、</p>
<p>米爾納侯爵說道、英國政府、因大調英軍後備隊、同海格總指揮一樣的覺得不安、遂請求召集這次會議、我便從容不迫的答稱、我迄未調動過英軍後備隊、我不過請海格總指揮考慮此事、及爲此準備以防萬一、况且除非到了真正緊要關頭、我絶無調盡其後備隊的意思、</p>
<p>這事件很容易的解决了、但由此可知聯軍總司令要客軍彼此諒解、不免時時遇着意外的困難、好像一個音樂隊、要使各色各樣樂器的和諧入調、必須相當的時間、</p>
<p>會議將軍的時候、别的問題提出討論、威爾遜司令重提法蘭特之戰所發生的問題、他問我、倘使德軍進攻巴黎、同時危及英軍北海根據地、我對於英軍將採取何種策略、</p>
<p>我便把我以前所說的重說一遍、我說我的計劃定力時固定漢法兩軍的聯絡、防守巴黎兼保海口、因彼此對於大戰的勝敗、有唇亡齒塞的關係、</p>
<p>暫置人民的以及各國政府的驚惶於不顧、敵人對於巴黎或海峽港口的主要目標、不久將於兩者之中獲得其一、這確是事實、當時的聯軍僅事防守、也不免疲於奔命、上至軍長、下至士卒、没有一人不覺得危機逼在目睫、各自有岌岌不可終日之勢、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chongguang Visited Wang Zhengting Yesterday to Personally Deliver Japan's Reply <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Japan Shifts Responsibility</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Prepares to Refute</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chongguang, along with Secretary Lin Chuchunei, arrived in Beijing by night train from Shanghai yesterday, reaching the city at 7:00 this morning. Chongguang, suffering from abdominal pain, went to the Japanese Consulate after arriving in Beijing to rest. He did not meet with Foreign Minister Wang in the morning. In the afternoon, at 4:00 PM, he went to the diplomatic residence to meet with Wang, personally delivering the Japanese government's reply regarding the Korean massacre case. Chongguang is scheduled to return to Shanghai by night train tomorrow. This reply was drafted in writing by Chongguang based on a telegram from the Japanese government, and its content is roughly the same as the verbal response given by Secretary Lin Chuchunei when he met with Minister Wang a few days ago. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Korean riot and the massacre of overseas Chinese, Acting Consul-General Chongguang arrived in Beijing on the 15th and went to the diplomatic residence in Sajiawan at 4:00 PM to meet with Foreign Minister Wang. He stayed for about an hour before leaving. During his meeting with Wang, Chongguang personally delivered a note, acting under the instructions of the Japanese government, in response to the note sent by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Acting Consul-General on the 7th of this month. It expressed regret for the incident and stated that the Korean local authorities had made every effort to take measures before and after the event, requesting our government's understanding. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the Korean local authorities did not effectively prevent the incident before it occurred and did not take appropriate measures when it did, which is not satisfactory. It is preparing to refute the note. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the reports from Consul-General Zhang Weicheng and others regarding the Korean massacre of overseas Chinese are too brief. Therefore, the first protest only demanded that Japan take full responsibility and reserved the right to raise claims for damages and future guarantees at any time. The reply sent by Japanese Acting Minister Chongguang today attempts to shift responsibility. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to refute it based on two main points: (1) Japan must still take concrete responsibility; (2) The location of the Wanbaoshan incident is not connected to Seoul at all. If Japan attempts to link the two cases, then the date of the Korean incident is only one day later than the date of the Wanbaoshan incident. The organized gathering of Koreans was clearly arranged by the authorities in advance, which makes Japan's responsibility even greater. Therefore, the Wanbaoshan case cannot be discussed together with this case. As for the issues of apology, punishment of the perpetrators, compensation, and future guarantees in the Korean case, these will only be mentioned in the rebuttal. The amount of damage and the amount requested will be submitted in a concrete note after Ambassador Wang's investigation. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Content of Japan's Reply <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Expresses Regret Regarding the Korean Case</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Our country's protest regarding the Korean massacre of overseas Chinese was issued on July 5th. Japan's reply was personally delivered by Chongguang to Foreign Minister Wang at 4:00 PM on July 15th. The content is divided into three levels. First, the Japanese government deeply regrets this case. However, the Governor-General's Office of Korea did its best to suppress the riots and rescue the overseas Chinese, and the situation is now stable, with the overseas Chinese gradually returning to their businesses. Second, regarding the extent of the casualties among the overseas Chinese, the Governor-General's Office of Korea announced that approximately 100 people were killed and 120 injured. The Japanese government is determined to severely punish the perpetrators and is preparing to compensate the victims. Finally, the Wanbaoshan incident has occurred since 1927 due to the oppression of Koreans in Manchuria by Chinese local officials, which led to the unrest in the Korean territory. However, the Governor-General's Office of Korea implemented special security measures after the conflict broke out, dispatching 220 police officers to Seoul and Incheon, 150 to Pyongyang, and 350 armed police officers. In addition, infantry regiments were also dispatched to suppress the unrest. Emergency treatment was given to the injured, and those seeking refuge were guided to safe places. The Seoul police substation was destroyed by Koreans, and 35 police officers were injured in Incheon and other places. In Pyongyang, police shot and killed one Korean while stopping the rioting. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The general idea of the Japanese reply is that the Japanese government deeply regrets this incident. Fortunately, as a result of the Korean Governor-General's Office doing its best to suppress the rioters and protect the overseas Chinese, the situation is completely stable, and the overseas Chinese are gradually returning to their businesses, which has put the Japanese government at ease. Regarding the conditions of the Chinese casualties, the rumors are somewhat exaggerated. According to the Governor-General's Office of Korea, in Pyongyang and other places, 100 overseas Chinese were killed and 120 were seriously injured. The Japanese government is determined to severely punish these rioters in accordance with national law. At the same time, it expresses deep sympathy to the victims and is currently working on ways to provide relief. The Wanbaoshan incident originated in 1927 due to the oppression of Koreans in Manchuria by Chinese local officials. The Governor-General's Office of Korea, in view of the disturbances in various parts of Korea, ordered local officials to maintain strict security. When conflicts broke out between Chinese and Koreans in Seoul and Incheon, special martial law was implemented, and 220 additional police officers were dispatched to Gyeonggi Province. When necessary, they were fully armed and did their best to suppress the unrest. In addition, 150 additional police officers were dispatched to Pyongyang. Not only were 350 armed police officers engaged in security, but also 51 officers and men from the local garrison regiment were ordered to act as auxiliary police to suppress the riot. The Governor-General's Office of Korea provided emergency treatment to the injured and accommodated Chinese refugees in police stations and other safe areas for protection. In the meantime, the Seoul police substation was destroyed by Koreans, 35 police officers were injured in Incheon, and in Pyongyang, in order to disperse the Korean crowds, the police opened fire and killed one Korean. Thirty-five police officers were also injured. Based on the above facts, it is sufficient to prove the efforts of the Japanese authorities to suppress the rioters and protect the overseas Chinese.

<h3 id="e3">Negotiations on Wanbaoshan Case Begin in Shenyang <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Consul-General Makes Counter-Demands</p>
<p>Zhang Zuoxiang Firmly Rejects</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shenyang dispatch: For the Wanbaoshan incident, Japanese Consul Lin Zhizhilang visited Zhang Zuoxiang on the afternoon of the 13th for an hour. Lin proposed (A) compensation for the losses of Korean residents, (B) requesting Zhang to allow continued cultivation, and (C) allowing Koreans to live in mixed communities. Zhang sternly refuted all of these proposals and decided to pay a return visit on the 14th to continue discussions. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fengtian) Regarding the negotiations on the Wanbaoshan incident, the Japanese side plans to have Consul-General Shiisha in Jilin conduct concrete negotiations with the Jilin Provincial Negotiation Committee in Jilin. On the other hand, Consul-General Lin in Shenyang will conduct basic negotiations with the Shenyang authorities Zhang Zuoxiang and Zang Shiyi regarding the issue of Koreans in Manchuria. After Zhang Xueliang returns to Shenyang, a comprehensive and fundamental solution will be made to the Korean issue in Manchuria. (15th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Consul-General Lin visited Zhang Zuoxiang at 9:00 this morning to begin negotiations on the Wanbaoshan incident. Consul-General Lin will await Consul Yanai's on-site investigation and conduct comprehensive negotiations on the issue of Koreans in Manchuria. The demands made by the Japanese side are: (1) compensation for the losses in the Wanbaoshan incident; (2) guaranteeing the lives and property of Koreans in Wanbaoshan; (3) allowing Koreans to live freely in Jilin Province; (4) cultivating rice in the Wanbaoshan paddy fields from next year onwards. If the Chinese side agrees, the Japanese officials will withdraw from the scene. Zhang Zuoxiang's secretary said in response that the Japanese demands were excessive and would be handled together with the Korean incident in Nanjing. (15th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' position on the Wanbaoshan case is that the case documents reported by the province are only the first batch. The recent developments in the negotiations after the incident have not yet been reported in detail. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has only instructed the province on the outline of the negotiations, while all negotiations are handled by local officials. However, the handling situation should be reported at any time. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Korean Riots Temporarily Subside <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has just received a telegram from Sinuiju stating that the riots in various parts of Korea have temporarily subsided. The number of overseas Chinese returning to Sinuiju has reached 3,000. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Special Dispatch from Seoul, Korea: Pyongyang is extremely quiet. At 8:00 PM on the 5th of this month, the rioters launched a surprise attack when we were unprepared. The riots subsided slightly at 6:00 AM on the 6th. The Japanese military and police watched without helping. 216 overseas Chinese were killed, and more than 500 men, women, old, and young were injured. Some were even disemboweled, their eyes gouged out, and their hearts and livers smeared on the ground. Even women and children were not spared, and many had their ears cut off. The old and new overseas Chinese streets were completely destroyed, and all the shops and goods were torn apart. Consul-General Zhang, upon hearing the news, immediately went to the Korean Police Bureau and sternly questioned them, saying that they had already asked the Bureau to pay attention before the riots broke out and had requested that they be armed. If they had been armed earlier, how could this have happened? Consul Xu of Chinnampo went to Pyongyang on the 6th to investigate, but when he arrived at the station, the Japanese police would not let him get off the train. He argued with them, but they would not listen. In the evening, a large-scale riot broke out in Chinnampo, surrounding the consulate. At that time, the consulate had already taken in more than a thousand overseas Chinese. Fortunately, the overseas Chinese from the United States and Britain had received reports early and inspected the area. The Japanese police, concerned about their reputation, finally armed themselves and dispersed the rioters, and their planned burning was not realized. On the evening of the 6th, Busan, Wonsan, and Heungnam were all tense. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Qingdao) Overseas Chinese who were victimized in Korea arrived in Qingdao at noon on the 15th on the Kyodo Maru from Yantai and Weihai, totaling 817 people. The Yantai Chamber of Commerce and the Public Security Bureau, Social Bureau, and Port Affairs Bureau jointly sent personnel to take care of them in advance, and food and lodging were prepared. About half of the overseas Chinese were injured, all with broken heads, torn faces, broken arms, and broken legs. There were no children because all the children were torn in half and killed by the rioters. In the afternoon, more than 20,000 people returned to their hometowns by sea, and more than 100 people went west by train. The remaining 50,000 people are temporarily staying at the Qiying Guild Hall. According to the overseas Chinese, when the riots broke out in Pyongyang, Japanese police were indeed present, directing the massacre. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Unite and Rise Up to Support the Korean Case Negotiations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Committee telegraphed to party branches, overseas Chinese organizations, and newspapers in various overseas locations on the 15th, stating that Japan's ambition to invade Manchuria and Mongolia has been a long-standing plot. The Wanbaoshan incident was followed by anti-Chinese riots in Korea within a day, almost throughout the entire territory. The Japanese instigated the riots in advance and then attempted to shirk responsibility afterwards. They are demanding the realization of mixed residency of Korean farmers in the interior. The Wanbaoshan incident was clearly secretly aided by the Japanese, and the Korean incident was premeditated. At this critical moment, overseas compatriots must unite and rise up to support the government until the goals of punishing the perpetrators, apologizing, compensating, and guaranteeing that such massacres will not happen again are achieved.

<p>Surround Chinese Police Station</p>
<p>Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>(Shenyang) At around 4:00 PM on the 14th, Chinese civilians Shen Yuhuai and Wu Xizhen were walking under the Qikong Bridge in Huangguantun when they saw a Japanese garrison soldier walking down from Daotai Road and said to each other, "Let's hurry up." The Japanese soldier misunderstood and cursed at them, then used the butt of his rifle to violently strike Shen, causing Shen's head to bleed profusely and his eyes to bulge out. Wu Xizhen, who was walking with him, was outraged and hugged the soldier around the waist. Shen also endured the pain to help restrain the Japanese soldier and take him to a nearby Chinese police station to reason with them. Just as they were about to interrogate him, a group of Japanese soldiers arrived and demanded the release of the assaulting Japanese soldier. The Chinese police refused. Then, more than a hundred soldiers from the Japanese garrison arrived, all armed, and surrounded the police station. More than ten of them broke in and snatched Shen, Wu, and the Japanese soldier away. They also injured Director Tan. The Japanese soldiers tied Shen and Wu up in the watchtower they had set up and severely beat them. At around 5:00 PM, the Japanese garrison finally withdrew. After negotiations between the two sides, the following results were achieved: (1) The Japanese soldier who caused the incident will be punished; (2) An apology will be issued to our side; (3) A guarantee will be made that such incidents will not happen again; (4) The injured will be sent to the Japanese Army Hospital for treatment, and the medical expenses will be borne by the Japanese side. The matter was resolved at around 9:00 PM. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At around 4:00 PM on the 14th, a Japanese garrison soldier at the Qikong Bridge in Huangguantun stabbed a pedestrian in the right eye with his rifle. The crowd was angered and wrestled with the soldier, taking him to the police station in charge. Just as the interrogation was taking place, a large group of more than a hundred Japanese police officers arrived on horseback and in cars, surrounded the police station, cut off traffic, and beat the director of the police station. The perpetrator and the injured Chinese civilians were all taken away. The matter is still under negotiation after the General Bureau sent personnel to negotiate.

<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Educational Reform Association issued a telegram today regarding the anti-Chinese affair in Korea, hoping that the whole country will unite and rise up to jointly face the national crisis. The Japanese incitement of Koreans to oppose Chinese is even worse than the May Thirtieth Tragedy. We should rescue overseas Chinese on the one hand and provide diplomatic support on the other.

<p>Since the recent occurrence of the Wanbaoshan incident, with the Japanese actively preparing for action and flexing their military muscles, the people of our country have begun to feel acutely the danger to the Northeast and the ambition of the Japanese. Letters and telegrams are flying, with appeals of blood and tears, and the public mood is rising and cannot be stopped. Alas, did the Japanese plot against our Northeast begin only today? Did the crisis in our Northeast arise only today? Being indifferent when things are calm, and clinging to Buddha's feet when things are urgent - this is the origin of today's crisis in the Northeast, and it is also the reason why the Japanese ambition is becoming more and more intense, until it is rampant and unscrupulous in our Northeast. The vast Northeast mainland, with its thousands of miles of land, has everything in agriculture and animal husbandry, and the mineral resources are the richest in our country, especially the reserves of coal and iron ore are amazing. The heavy oil in Fushun is estimated to yield 300,000 tons of crude oil annually, enough for 300 years of extraction. In terms of geography, it is located where East Japan and North Russia mutually press against each other, and the White Mountains and Black Waters defend our borders. With such mountains and rivers and such advantageous land, if our country had paid attention to it earlier and developed it earlier, it would not only have kept the border from inviting prying eyes, but the development of rich resources would have benefited our national economy and people's livelihood immeasurably. However, the people of our country neglect it because of its remoteness, or fear it because of its cold climate. They neither know nor seek to know the mountains, rivers, terrain, products, and customs of the Northeast. They sit and watch the vast land become half-desolate, and the boundless treasures are buried underground. Even in recent years, when people on both sides of our Yellow River and Yangtze River have suffered from congestion and life has been difficult, the people of our country still stick to their deaths, huddled together, and watch the broad expanse of the Northeast's land and easily available wealth, unwilling to move there. What foolishness in the world surpasses ours? On the other hand, the Russians and Japanese have spared no effort in researching and investigating our Northeast. The government has encouraged them from above, and the people have worked hard from below. They have depicted detailed maps and written specialized books on the history, geography, customs, products, agriculture, and mineral resources of our Northeast. They have set up the Manchuria and Mongolia Resources Museum to investigate resources and the Agricultural Experiment Station to study agricultural issues. Various experts are conducting research. For example, the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau publish dozens and hundreds of books on the Northeast every year. The government spends a huge amount of money every year to train specialized personnel to study our Northeast. They seek to know us in order to plot against us, while we sit idly by and wait to be dissected and manipulated, completely unaware. Ask about the terrain of the Northeast and we do not know. Ask about the products of the Northeast and we do not know. Ask about the population of the Northeast and we do not know. What we abandon is what others benefit from. Tigers and leopards are watching around, and lambs are abandoned in the wild. How can we expect them not to become prey? Therefore, the danger in the Northeast does not begin today, but begins with the people of our country's long-standing lack of knowledge of the Northeast. The Japanese invasion of our Northeast also does not begin today, but begins with their early research and investigation. Listen to the wailing sound of the steam whistles on the South Manchuria and Chinese Eastern Railways, the evil coal-digging sound of Fushun, and the rattling machines of the various Japanese factories in the Northeast. Look at the dense Japanese troops along the South Manchuria Railway, the Japanese police stationed in Shenyang City, and the bustling Japanese and Russian merchants traveling on the roads. Even if the Wanbaoshan incident had not occurred, could we have said that the Northeast was safe and not worth worrying about? Outsiders know us and can plot against us. We are waiting to be cut open because we do not know ourselves. When the knife is at our throat, we cry out in pain. This kind of phenomenon is not only enough to destroy our Northeast, but also enough to destroy our country and our nation. How well put are the words of Mr. Ma Xiangbo: "If you want to save China, first save the Northeast; if you want to save the Northeast, first know the Northeast." Although old, Mr. Ma is still diligently seeking knowledge about the Northeast, and his insights are as sharp and painful as a blow to the head. Mr. Wu Tiecheng also said, "If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know the vastness of the Northeast; if you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know the crisis of the Northeast." His words are all pertinent because of his personal experience. At this critical moment, if the people of our country do not study the Northeast, when will they?</p>

<h3 id="e13">Central Political Conference <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Passed the Regulations for the Hangzhou Municipal Autonomous Region</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting Reports on Diplomacy with Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Conference held its 280th meeting on the morning of the 15th, chaired by Yu Youren. The Local Autonomy Group reported on the examination of the division of districts, neighborhoods, and lanes in Hangzhou Municipality.  It was found that it could not be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Organization Law. It was proposed that Article 5 of the Municipal Organization Law, which stipulates special circumstances, be interpreted broadly to allow for flexibility. It was found that the presentation was in line with the provisions of the law, and it seemed appropriate to approve it. A resolution was requested. The resolution was passed in accordance with the examination opinion.</p>
<p>Attached is the examination report of the Local Autonomy Group. Article 5 of the Municipal Organization Law stipulates that a neighborhood should consist of five households, a lane of five neighborhoods, a ward of twenty lanes, and a district of ten wards. This was originally intended to ensure uniformity in compilation and division, hence the fixed standards. However, population density and geographical size vary from place to place. If the numbers are strictly limited, obstacles will inevitably arise. Therefore, the first half of this article also provides for special circumstances as a fundamental way to allow flexibility. The so-called special circumstances do not specify conditions or restrictions.  Therefore, whenever it is impossible to form a neighborhood with five households, a lane with five neighborhoods, a ward with twenty lanes, or a district with ten wards, it can be interpreted as special, allowing for flexibility in division and compilation. This is the intention of the legislation and needs no further explanation. The land inside and outside Hangzhou City differs greatly. The inner city has a dense population, with more than ten households living in one dwelling.  If a neighborhood is formed with five households, it will inevitably be fragmented and difficult to manage. In the outer city, the population is too small, with more than ten households forming a village. If a lane is formed with five neighborhoods, it will also be impossible to start. These difficulties are precisely the special circumstances mentioned in Article 5 of the Municipal Organization Law. The original proposal to allow for flexible division is in line with the provisions of the law and it seems appropriate to approve it. Whether or not this is appropriate is respectfully submitted for public resolution. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Central Political Conference on the morning of the 15th, in addition to discussing the proposals, Wang Zhengting reported that in the negotiations on the Korean Incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had lodged a protest with Japan, and that a protest on the Wanbaoshan case was also being prepared.  The two cases are different in nature and should be negotiated separately, and will not be combined. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Zhang Yichou Discusses the Cuban Sugar Loan Contract <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Yichou said that the Cuban refined sugar factory loan contract was handled by Xu Shanxiang, a technical expert of the Ministry. The content is: (1) The time limit for the recovery of factory rights is only required when our country has paid off the Cuban capital. Within twenty years, it can be recovered. (2) The principle for raw materials is to purchase domestic products. When it is insufficient, the factory will entrust the Cuban side to purchase the cheapest sugar in the world, and the handling fee is five per thousand. (3) When raw sugar and refined sugar are exported to foreign countries, it will be handled by the Cuban side. This is Cuba's repeated request, because they are afraid of purchasing cheaply and selling cheaply. The factory is entirely for supplying the people of the country. If there is a surplus, it will be promoted to overseas Chinese. It is feared that there will not be much surplus for export to foreign countries. (4) Cuba originally requested to be allocated 20% of the surplus profits, but our side firmly refused. Later, it was agreed to allocate 5% of the surplus profits, that is, the surplus, to the Cuban side. Minister Kong once said that the contract is very good, and only by handling it well can profits be obtained. When the factory is established, a supervisory committee will be organized, with six Chinese and three Cubans. The director of staff and engineering organization and the deputy director of accounting organization are Cubans, and the rest are Chinese. The name of the factory is set as the State-Run Sugar Refinery. The internal organization is divided into four groups: engineering, accounting, general affairs, and sales. The location is Shanghai. It is heard that the draft contract will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Looking at the current situation, it seems that the method of solving the financial crisis has not yet been found. The directors of the Berlin Stock Exchange have decided to continue the closure this week. Banks and metal, food, and securities exchanges across the country remain closed today. Whether Berlin Stock Exchange will follow tomorrow and remain closed is a question that the world is eager to know. After hearing that the Berlin Stock Exchange had announced that it would not open this week, the German government issued two orders to supplement the emergency orders, allowing the court to postpone the payment of private promissory notes and accounts that are due for one week. Government officials and financial figures are now meeting to discuss ways to quell the turmoil and restore order. However, due to the serious domestic political situation, the financial situation is becoming more dangerous. As for the French demands, the government seems to remain determined to reject them. If they are recognized once, the cabinet will be overthrown immediately, and the Communist Party and the Fascist Party will determine the fate of the country in the future.</p>

<p>German banks and securities exchanges are all closed, and French banks and securities exchanges are also closed due to memorial day. Therefore, London exchanges are not active today. The importance of Germany and its relationship to maintaining its national bank and currency system is very clear. Therefore, there are still many who are optimistic about the future. The main problem in Germany is how to raise long-term debt. The recent sudden financial panic in Germany was mostly caused by foreign creditors withdrawing short-term debts from Germany. The Times said that if a solution is not found quickly, it seems that complete suspension of payments cannot be avoided. The spirit of France to protect itself, and the French bankers' knowledge of maintaining their huge liquidity position, makes the situation more dangerous from an international standpoint and makes the problem of assisting Germany more difficult. There was not much trading on the London Stock Exchange today, and almost all types of securities fell in price. Hungarian banks closed, Romanian banks failed, and Bohemia was also affected, causing all foreign securities to weaken. Even South American and Swedish securities could not resist the fall.</p>

<p>When the German government first received the Basel news, it was quite optimistic, but the optimism was fleeting, because Dr. Luther, the governor of the National Bank, who was negotiating a loan with the International Clearing Bank, had not yet achieved anything. The German government is still not prepared to buy a loan at the price demanded by France, so it is now planning strict internal measures. A noteworthy suggestion is that the old currency used in 1923, the Rentenmark, be reused in the market as the national currency. This currency does not require gold reserves, and the National Bank still has about 100 million of this currency.</p>

<p>The rumor that the German government will soon issue new currency has been confirmed by financial circles this afternoon. The new currency will be a type of new Mark banknote, used exclusively within the country, without any cash reserves, and theoretically secured by the entire national assets. While this move inevitably carries a revolutionary nature in the monetary system, it is the only way to address the emergency and allows the government to have more freedom in future loan negotiations.</p>

<p>The leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, told a Reuters reporter today that he had long foreseen Germany's current panic. The current situation originates from the peace treaty, which not only affects politics but also devastates Germany's economic life. The final and most severe result is a slide into a communist chaotic situation, and all of Europe will be dragged in. The only way to preserve the country from this calamity is to thoroughly reform the German system and establish an anti-communist front. He and his party members are always prepared, alone or in conjunction with other parties, to accept the responsibility of organizing national affairs.</p>

<p>To all newspapers: Since the Japanese imperialists, assisted by military police, infringed on the farmland of Wanbaoshan with Korean people and shot and killed farmers, they have incited the Korean people with proclamations and instigated hoodlums to massacre Chinese residents in Korea. In a few days, in places like Incheon, Seoul, Pyongyang, Wonsan, and Busan, countless Chinese residents were massacred or forced into the sea, numbering in the thousands. Countless people were injured and fled. All the property of the Chinese residents in Korea was burned. Even our consulate in Korea was invaded and destroyed. This kind of organized and planned riot could not have been carried out by Korean people who are unarmed and lack freedom. It is clearly a pre-arranged conspiracy of the Japanese imperialists to invade. Now the matter is urgent, the country is in danger. We hope that our government and people, in this utter humiliation, will quickly rise up and work together to formulate countermeasures: (1) Ask the central government to quickly take the most effective and necessary measures to protect the Chinese residents in Korea; (2) Ask the central government to lodge a serious protest with Japan, ordering them to quickly stop the continuation of the riots, severely punish all the principal and accessory criminals, and compensate for all losses; (3) Announce the truth of the massacre to all countries in the world, and promote international justice; (4) All the people of the country pledge to fully support the central government; (5) Do our best to protect Japanese and Korean residents in the country, to demonstrate the proper attitude of our civilized nation. We hope for unified advocacy, to help the country out of its difficulties. The future of the nation is deeply dependent on it. Henan Provincial Government, Cold.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, your official document No. 38 of June 6th has been received and respectfully read. This dispute is of the utmost importance to the majority of landlords and farmers. The ownership of the land by the landlords and farmers there is a legitimate and inherent right. Regarding the work currently being carried out by the Korean people to channel water from the Yitong River, it is necessary to investigate on-site whether there is a consensual agreement between both parties, and how this work is causing damage to the landlords and farmers, in order to seek a fair and just resolution. Regarding the agreement reached between us yesterday that both parties' police will withdraw at the same time, the Korean people will stop work, and both parties will send representatives to conduct on-site investigations together, and then an appropriate resolution will be made. In accordance with the preceding reasons in your letter, a corresponding letter is hereby sent in reply for your review. To: Resident Japanese Consul in Changchun, Toshiro Tashiro, June 9th.</p>

<h3 id="e84">After Chinese Residents in Korea Sought Refuge in Andong <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Affairs Support Council Resolved Eight Items</p>
<p>Accommodating Over Three Thousand Three Hundred People</p>
<p>All Circles Enthusiastically Relieving Refugees</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: Chinese residents in Korea, unable to withstand the oppression of the rioters, have been returning to Andong in droves to seek refuge in recent days. The Andong County Government, together with the Public Security Bureau and the General Chamber of Commerce, are working hard to find ways to provide relief. Various entertainment venues in the city have been borrowed and converted into shelters. As of noon on the 10th, a total of 2,881 refugees have been accommodated. In addition, people from all walks of life have been generously donating to help the refugees. Moreover, Japanese merchants in Chinese Street, such as Dalian Steamship Company, Shimizu Yoko, Xiecheng Bank, Manchuria Bank, Fukuzo Yoko, etc., have voluntarily donated 30 to 50 yuan each, in order to ease the tension with the Chinese side. The National Foreign Affairs Support Council of this port held</p>
<p>Meetings repeatedly in recent days, and voted on eight items: (1) To issue a comforting declaration to the citizens of this port; (2) To advise citizens to proceed along the right track and avoid exaggerated propaganda that deviates from the facts; (3) To resolve to inform the whole country of the tragic situation of the riot; (4) To telegraph to the provincial and higher authorities to report the actual situation and request instructions; (5) To send representatives from the association to the shelters to comfort the refugees; (6) To send representatives from the association to be responsible for investigating the course of the tragedy and collect various materials; (7) To inquire with the provincial association about its stance on the riots and request that it order all branches to act in unison; (8) To request that the authorities appoint appropriate personnel to go to the site of the incident to conduct a thorough investigation of the losses of the Chinese people, in order to demand compensation. This afternoon, Mr. Han Jinghai, chairman of the Sinuiju Chamber of Commerce, came to Andong and met with the local authorities to report that Consul Zhu of Sinuiju had made serious representations to the Japanese side. The governor of Pyeonganbuk-do replied that the Korean people would not take such actions again. The Japanese authorities in Sinuiju also made the same statement verbally. County Magistrate Wang Jie'an believed that this verbal statement was not sufficient and requested a written guarantee, but was not granted. It can be seen that they have no sincerity in protecting them.</p>
<p>Another correspondence: Since the riots throughout Korea, Chinese residents in Korea have been fleeing to Andong in droves. However, because Korean people gathered on the Yalu River Bridge to obstruct and beat them, many have been crossing on sampans in the river. From the morning of the 7th to the evening of the 10th, the stream has not stopped. The violence of the Korean rioters has not yet ended, but has decreased somewhat in the last day or two compared to the 7th and 8th. Since this case occurred, the market in Andong has been extremely turbulent, and the atmosphere has suddenly become tense. Every day the streets are crowded with pedestrians, especially near the Japanese concession in Qidaogou. Heavy guard posts have been added to the Sino-Japanese border, and the city's merchant corps has also been fully mobilized to suppress the unrest. Moreover, because the theaters and cinemas are all full of refugees, all entertainment venues in the city have been closed down, presenting a rather unique phenomenon. However, all the small restaurants are making three times their usual profit, and although the inns are full of refugees, because they have fled alone, they are unable to pay for room and board. In recent days, the Japanese telegraph office has banned sending telegrams about this case, and the Japanese post office has also strictly checked the passengers on the Chinese-Korean route, and they must pass through inspection before being allowed to pass. The number of refugees currently being accommodated locally is roughly as follows: Refugees Temporary First Shelter, Dan Gui Stage, 1,200 people; Second Shelter, Xin Ming Stage, 569 people; Third Northeast Cinema, 410 people; Fourth Dong Ping Cinema, 317 people; Fifth Dong Ming Cinema, 385 people. All of the above five shelters are under the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau for day and night protection.

Excluding those who have relied on relatives and friends, there are a total of over 3,300 refugees (the above is the number counted up to the 10th). Before the negotiations are properly resolved, they can only be temporarily accommodated here. Moreover, the people of the city are voluntarily donating money and assisting with steamed buns in an unusually enthusiastic manner. Sun Guangyu Tang, a wealthy gentleman in the city, donated 120 yuan. County Government Chairman Wang Jiegong, Commercial Port Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Hanwei, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Sun Langxuan, and Yucheng Hao, Jiang Chunbo, etc., each donated 100 yuan. Up to the afternoon of the 10th, it is estimated that over 2,100 yuan has been received in donations, and over 30,000 steamed buns (11th).</p>
<h3 id="e85">Overseas Chinese in Tokyo and Toyama Attacked by Koreans <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Osaka Correspondence: Recently, incidents of Koreans attacking and beating Overseas Chinese in the Japanese mainland have occurred from time to time. The Japanese government does not take measures to suppress the violence of the Koreans. At 9:00 PM on the 10th of this month, the home of Overseas Chinese Fang Renli, who lives in Toyama City near Tokyo, was suddenly broken into by Koreans wielding iron bars and other weapons, who completely destroyed the furniture and injured Fang and others. At around 11:00 PM, another five or six Koreans came to commit violence again. The Fang family was attacked twice in one night, and everything was completely destroyed. Fortunately, during the second act of violence, more than a dozen Japanese police officers arrived and arrested one Korean, who is currently being held in the Toyama Station for questioning. The Korean's name is Kim Bok-bu, and he is a construction worker (July 11th).</p>
<h3 id="e86">Case of American Hospital in Dezhou Shooting and Killing a Chinese Person <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Murderer is the Deputy Superintendent, American DeForest</p>
<p>The County Magistrate and the Local Court have Examined the Corpse and Taken Photographs</p>
<p>Han Fuju Ordered the Secretariat to Investigate in Detail and Handle the Case</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: To the east of Dezhou City, in Dongdi, there is the Weishi Boji Hospital, which is run by the church. The location is grand, and the equipment is also very comprehensive. However, the foreigners in the hospital are extremely violent. Very few people from De County seek medical treatment there. Most of those who are treated every day are their religious followers. At around 5:00 AM on the 11th, the Deputy Superintendent of the hospital, American DeForest, suddenly shot and killed Wang Guoqing, a Chinese worker in the hospital. Due to serious injuries, he died soon after. At that time, the hospital kept it strictly secret and refused to tell anyone. Therefore, it was not until the 12th that De County Magistrate Li Shude and others received a report. They immediately went to the hospital early that morning, together with Court President Wang of the local court, Prosecutor Sun, Committee Member Wang of the County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, and the chiefs of the Education, Public Security, Finance, and Construction Bureaus, to examine the body of Wang Guoqing. It was found that Wang Guoqing's body was covered in blood, and he had been shot in the lower back, resulting in serious injuries and death. The bullet that entered had not been taken out. A photo was immediately taken for evidence. As for the reason why American DeForest shot and killed Wang Guoqing, the hospital was evasive and the details are still unknown. Today (13th), De County Magistrate Li Shude sent a telegram to Jinan, separately to Chairman Han Fuju and Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, reporting everything. Han immediately instructed the secretariat to investigate the truth and then handle the case. At the same time, Wu Zhenzuan, President of the High Court, also received a telegram from the De County Local Court, and the Shandong Provincial Reorganization Committee also received a telegram from the County Party Department. All circles in Jinan are shocked and outraged that the American dared to arbitrarily shoot and kill a Chinese person in the interior of our country, and his violence can be said to be extreme. The telegram from De County Magistrate Li Shude to Chairman Han and Civil Affairs Director Li is included below: "To Chairman Han and Civil Affairs Director Li: At around 5:00 AM this morning, American DeForest, Deputy Superintendent of the Weishi Boji Hospital of the church in our county, shot and killed Wang Guoqing, a Chinese worker in the hospital, who died shortly afterwards. The county magistrate heard the news this morning and went to examine the body with Court President Wang, Prosecutor Sun, Committee Member Mao of the County Department, and the chiefs of the bureaus. It was found that he was injured in the lower back, and the bullet had entered but not exited. A photograph was taken immediately. In addition to waiting for the cause to be ascertained, a detailed report will be sent separately. Respectfully reported, Official Li Shude bowed." (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Communist Bandits in Western Jiangxi Defeated One After Another <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Kong Gang Fled to the Border of Hunan and Hubei</p>
<p>The Li Gang Fled to the Vicinity of Xinfeng</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The border area of ​​Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi to the west of the Gan River was originally a den of Communist bandits. After the Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang gangs concentrated on the east bank of the Gan River, those in western Jiangxi, including Kong Hechong's pseudo-Independent Division, Li Shixing's pseudo-16th Army, Liu Tiechao's pseudo-20th Army, and Li Mingrui's pseudo-7th Army, were scattered in Yongxin, Jinlian, Lotus, Tonggu, Wanzai, and the Pingliu, Linggui, and Yangxin areas of Hunan, and the Shixi area of ​​Hubei. They drifted and were unpredictable, sometimes in Hunan, sometimes in Hubei, and sometimes in Jiangxi. Yesterday, according to a victory report from the Yifeng Office, on the 7th of this month, Kong Hechong's pseudo-4th Brigade held a welcoming meeting for the pseudo-Soviet Provincial Government Committee on Tianbao Mountain (the bandit nest of Yifeng Tonggu). The pseudo-79th and 2 divisions also rushed from the border of Hunan to participate. After learning the news, the Suppression of Communist bandits army stationed in Yifeng immediately organized a team and rushed to attack. The bandit army resisted stubbornly. After eight hours of fierce fighting, the Suppression of Communist bandits army finally broke through the bandit's position and occupied Tianbao. The remnants of the bandits fled into the mountains on the border of Hunan and Hubei. Hundreds of bandits were killed in this battle, dozens were captured, and dozens of guns were seized. The Li Mingrui gang on the Hunan-Jiangxi border recently entered Guidong and Lingxian of Hunan from Lotus. Because the Hunan East Army fiercely encircled and suppressed them, they re-entered Ganzhou from Chongyi Shangyou, attempting to attack Ganzhou City. Fortunately, the Ma brigade had prepared in advance, and the bandits failed to succeed. It is said that they have fled south to the Xinfeng area. As for the Liu bandits and Zeng Bingchun and other small gangs who harassed the Yuan River and appeared in Xinyu, Xiajiang, and Fenyi, they have more than a thousand guns. They have also been severely suppressed by the Zhu brigade and suffered heavy losses. They have no power. In addition, Yongxin, Ninggang, and Lianhua, which are on the border of Hunan, have been occupied by bandits for three years. The tragic situation is difficult to describe. The bandit leaders are still unknown, and they are mostly local peasant bandits and vagrants. There are very few guns. After the large gangs in southern Jiangxi are suppressed, these small gangs will not be enough to quell (July 13th).</p>
<h3 id="e88">Compilation of Progress of the Suppression of Communist Bandits Army <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Right Wing Encircled and Attacked Donggu</p>
<p>The Left Wing Went Straight to Guangchang</p>
<p>The Central Route Recovered Zhaoxie</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Suppression of Communist Bandits Army has been attacking the various bandit nests for days, with the momentum of breaking bamboo. Now, the situation is compiled as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Right Wing Recovered Futian <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Futian, 60 miles south of Ji'an, is located between Jishui and Taihe. Its terrain is dangerous and is the location of the Red Bandit's Pseudo Provincial Government. After capturing Wangtian, the various armies of the Right Wing of the Suppression of Communist Bandits Army divided into routes to capture Futian. The bandits immediately withdrew to Donggu (60 miles from Futian). The Suppression of Communist Bandits Army occupied Futian on the 10th and searched many important documents of the Red Bandits in the bandit den, which roughly stated that we (the bandits call themselves) should quickly withdraw the various departments due to strategic considerations, leaving the old and weak to guard Donggu and reorganizing the strong into Fujian. From this, we can see the strategy and discouragement of the Red Bandits. After the Right Wing Army captured Futian, they searched and advanced towards Donggu, encircling Donggu and limiting it to be recovered before the 15th. Also, our army has cleared the bandits in Shuikou, Shuinan, and Baisha and arrived at Luofang.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Our Army Destroyed Xingtan <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>This place has recently received a telegram from Commander Hao, roughly stating that our army occupied Xingtan Yanfang today and captured more than a hundred peasant bandits. The remnants of the bandits fled to the old nest. According to the bandits who were captured, the pseudo-Soviet Provincial Government was originally in Xingtan, with two to three hundred guns and more than 500 bandits. Since Tengtian was occupied by the National Army, the bandit officials of the pseudo-Provincial Government were all panic-stricken and fled in all directions.</p>
<h3 id="e91">The Central Route Advanced to Ningu <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Sun Lianzhong reported on the 9th of the Central Route Army that our Dong brigade occupied Dongbei at Gengchen, and the bandits collapsed towards the Dongbianling Houfang Tanghou. Li Brigade Yuyu occupied Xinfeng at Wushi, seized more than 20 guns, and killed about 300 bandits. Capturing more than 30 people, the remnants of the bandits, the pseudo-3rd Army 9th Division Commander Lu Yangang and 37th Division Commander Chen Bojun, collapsed to the southeast. It is said that they have a plan to retreat to Luokou Longgang. At the same time, Gao Division of the same army corps once again broke through the important bandit nest of Zhaoxie in Le'an, opening the throat into Ningdu. Gao's department then attacked Dongshao Luokou of Ningdu. According to reconnaissance reports, the large gangs of armed bandits in those two places had already withdrawn, and only small gangs of Red Bandits were covering the retreat, and they were about to retreat to Ningdu City. Dongshao Luokou will be captured in a matter of days. This is the gateway to Ningdu City, and with this, Ningdu should not be a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Guangchang is About to be Recaptured <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>When the Left Wing of the Suppression of Communist Bandits Army advanced from Nanfeng to Guangchang, the bandits in the various bandit nests on the Nangguang border, such as Xiaotian and Qiacun, had all fled at the sight of the army. Therefore, after the Suppression of Communist Bandits Army arrived at Baishui, they immediately copied south of Guangcheng, advancing south from Qiacun Kuzhu, and directly approaching Dongshao, so Guangchang City is not a problem. As for the Suppression of Communist Bandits Army after capturing Lichuan, they have arrived at Deshengguan, the border of Shaowu Chengchuan. The bandits in Guangze and Shaowu have collapsed to Ninghua Changting.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Plight of the Red Bandits <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Red Bandits were originally divided into three front armies, under the jurisdiction of more than a dozen pseudo-armies and several independent divisions. However, they all focused on burning and killing. Since Chiang himself supervised the encirclement and suppression of the army, the Red Bandits were extremely terrified. Now, the confessions of the bandits obtained by the various armies are extracted as follows to see one aspect: Gao Shuxun's gray telegram stated that according to a bandit scout's confession, the main force of the bandits had fled to the border between Fujian and Jiangxi. Now, due to the pressure from the National Army, they have changed their strategy, and Zhu Mao has ordered all the bandits to gather in Donggu within six days in order to survive. Shangguan Yunxiang's telegram stated that according to the confession of a surrendered bandit company commander, the elite troops of the Red Bandits have all been sent to the Fujian border to plunder food and transport it back to their old nest in order to defend it to the death. However, the Red Bandits are good at attacking but not good at defending. If the National Army strikes with full force, they can be completely eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Commander Chiang Orders Establishment of Prisoner-of-War Camps <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang, considering the large number of captured Red bandits from various armies, and especially the pitiable plight of coerced peasant bandits, has specifically ordered the Chief Commanders of the left and right wings, He and Chen, and Chief of Staff Xiong, to establish prisoner-of-war reception camps in Nanfeng, Nancheng, Ji'an, and Nanchang. This is to accommodate and reform them. The Party and Government Committee is currently actively preparing for this. (July 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Zhang Jingyao Returns Documents from Hunan Province <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Totaling More Than Thirty Sheets</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: During Zhang Jingyao's tenure as governor of Hunan, he aggressively extorted wealth. Afterwards, he even absconded with Hunanese property, causing significant losses to public and private assets in Hunan Province. Recently, when Shao Lizi went north, Zhang ingratiated himself and, during their conversation, surprisingly produced a large package of land and property deeds from the former Hankou branch of the Hunan Bank, which he had seized during his time as governor. The package contained over thirty sheets. His intention was to curry favor, but also because the properties covered by the deeds were all located in Hankou, making them impossible to manage. These deeds have now been taken back to the province by Zhang Muxian, director of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters' office in Beijing, and handed over to the Finance Department for verification. It is reported that the Finance Department considers the deeds returned by Zhang to be only a portion of the total and plans to send another letter requesting the return of the remainder for proper arrangement. As for the thirty-odd deeds returned this time, the Finance Department has already instructed Tao Bingyi, the Hunan property administrator in Hubei, to inspect and verify them according to the deeds. The instruction reads: "It has been found that the title deeds for the Hunan Bank property in Hankou, previously managed by this department, were all taken away by Zhang Jingyao in the ninth year of the Republic. Yesterday, Zhang Muxian, director of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters' office in Beijing, handed over several property deeds from Zhang Jingyao's returned property in Hankou. After the handover, a copy of the addresses and names of the deeds is enclosed. You are to inspect and verify them for record. Furthermore, upon checking the two deeds for Zhuanwa Lane listed in the attached sheet, there is still a piece of land that was negotiated but could not be recovered. Also, there is no record in this department for a plot of land at Huangjiadun Dadangzi. Please investigate and recover it, and report the findings for verification." (July 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Enthusiastic Efforts by Various Sectors in Guangdong to Raise Funds for Flood Relief <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Organizations and Groups Have Dispatched Relief Teams on Separate Routes</p>
<p>The Fundraising Office is Renamed the All-Sectors Flood Relief Association</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The massive floods in the three rivers of Guangdong Province have caused severe devastation. In recent days, the upstream of the West River has continued to breach dikes. Because the West River is receding very slowly, the water level at Sanshui Southwest was sixteen feet and two inches deep on the morning of the eighth, receding nine inches in the afternoon. The dikes upstream have been saturated for days, and collapse is feared. Currently, villagers near the dikes are conscripting workers day and night for rescue efforts, which are extremely busy. However, due to insufficient rescue efforts, some dikes have already collapsed, including the Wutang Dike in the Sixth District of Gaoyao County and the Sanzhou Dike in Gaoming County, with breaches of hundreds of feet. In addition, the Nan'an, Xiaoling, Baihe, and Junzhou dikes have collapsed successively, with breaches of hundreds or dozens of feet. Currently, the disaster areas in the northwest and west rivers are vast, and disaster-stricken groups are sending over ten telegrams daily appealing for relief. The Chamber of Commerce, charitable organizations, and hospitals established a fundraising office some days ago, immediately forming the first and second emergency relief teams. The Fangbian Hospital and the city Chamber of Commerce each advanced 5,000 yuan to purchase grain for distribution in the Beijiang areas of Yingde, Yuantan, Sanshui, and Qingyuan. The relief team arrived in Sanshui on the afternoon of the seventh and then proceeded to Sihui before heading to Qingyuan and Yingde. The third and fourth teams departed on the eighth on the Fumin and Xin'an ships, with a total of over sixty team members, carrying 56,000 catties of rice donated by the Hong Kong Po Tao Hall and a large quantity of medicines donated by various pharmacies. They set off for the disaster areas in Qingyuan and Qingjiang. The fifth relief team is scheduled to depart on the tenth aboard two merchant ships for Sanshui and Sihui. Also, the Tung Wah Hospital of Hong Kong and the Nanyang Company have transported a large quantity of rice and formed a relief team that will join in the distribution on the seventh and eighth. On the ninth, the group sent out thirty more personnel with thirty-nine boxes of biscuits and one hundred bags of rice aboard two merchant ships and the Xinping steamship, departing for areas under Sanshui, Lubao, Sihui, and Qingyuan. Ten-odd relief workers from the Provincial Civil Affairs Department set out on the morning of the eighth at ten o'clock, along with officials from the River Management Office, to provide disaster relief and investigate the situation in the disaster areas along the way, carrying a large quantity of grain and over ten loads of cakes and miscellaneous grains. These relief workers have arrived at their destinations one after another, distributing relief separately and conducting on-the-ground investigations. The authorities recently ordered the allocation of 50,000 yuan for relief distribution, which can be delivered to the Civil Affairs Department during the day for distribution. In addition, donors include Hong Kong merchants who donated 1,000 yuan, the Shipping Association which donated 2,000 catties of rice, and another 5,000 catties of relief rice from Hong Kong which will arrive today. Compatriots from Qingyuan residing in the province have appointed fundraising specialists to solicit donations in various places and arrange for disaster-stricken residents of the county to come to the province for admission to the pauper education and care home. The fundraising office established by the business and charitable sectors a few days ago yesterday resolved to rename itself the Guangdong Flood Relief Association, jointly organized by the business and charitable sectors, and invited representatives from the political and media sectors to join in the charitable cause. Zou Lu was publicly elected as the chairman of the relief association, which is divided into four departments: general affairs, fundraising, relief affairs, and public relations. Each department has subordinate publicity and entertainment sections to facilitate operations. (July 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Flooding in Counties Along the Huai River in Northern Anhui <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Disaster Situation is Extremely Severe, Refugees Cry Out for Food</p>
<p>Bengbu Red Swastika Society Appeals on Behalf of Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Northern Anhui has suffered repeatedly from banditry, and the people's livelihood has not yet been eased. Everyone hoped for a bumper harvest this autumn to recover and breathe, but in recent days, continuous rain has caused rivers to flood, not only destroying the autumn harvest but also collapsing houses and leaving people homeless. Alas, the disaster victims have nowhere to die. The surge in the Huai River's water level is actually due to the rise of the Three Rivers Tip in the upper reaches due to heavy rain. Counties along the Huai River have mostly become wetlands, and the disaster situation is more severe than in the tenth year of the Republic. Recently, Fuyang County alone has had 50,000 households flooded, with over 2,000 disaster victims drowned and a large number of livestock killed. The northern border of Huoqiu is entirely under water, and fields of grain have all been flooded. Disaster victims are coming east in groups to escape the disaster, and those passing through the area these days are endless, sleeping in the wind and eating in the dew, in a miserable state. The county has suffered both the Red disaster and now the flood disaster, which is truly tragic. The city wall of Shouxian is close to the Huai River. With days of torrential rain, the river overflowed, and a foot of the city wall was washed away. Residents inside the city are rushing to rebuild while blocking the four gates to prevent flooding. Yingshang and Fengtai counties, due to their proximity to the Huai River, have raging floods, and villages on both sides of the river are flooded, and the disaster can be imagined. Huaiyuan County is located at the confluence of the Wo and Huai Rivers, which is a crucial point. Due to the continuous heavy rain, the two rivers have overflowed in recent days, and the area within dozens of miles is a vast expanse of water. Within the old city, boats travel on level ground, and villages outside the city have mostly become wetlands. Suxian County suffered a terrible hail disaster last month, and recently, the northwest area of the county has also experienced severe flooding, with all of the autumn harvest being submerged. The disaster victims in Bengbu have been provided with emergency relief by local organizations and groups, and enough donations will be raised within days to begin distribution. In the area of Wuhe County, downstream of the Huai River, a flood control dike was destroyed by torrential rain, and water flowed outward, destroying many riverside villages. In Xuyi County, the floods have been severe, and the water is vast. The disaster is also extremely severe. Along the upper and lower reaches of the Huai River, fields and crops have been damaged and submerged, and the autumn harvest will definitely be greatly reduced. The Bengbu branch of the World Red Swastika Society believes that the floods in the counties along the Huai River are extremely tragic and that relief should be sought. On the 11th and 12th, they telegraphed the National Government, the Anhui Provincial Government, the Central Relief Committee, the Anhui Relief Committee, and the Red Swastika Societies in Beijing, Ping, and Hangzhou, reporting the flood situation in northern Anhui and appealing on behalf of the disaster victims, requesting the allocation of funds for relief. Also, when the Huai River was experiencing torrential rain and rising floodwaters the other day, the water flow was rapid, and navigation was dangerous. Small short- and long-distance passenger ferries were temporarily suspended. Since the 12th, the weather has cleared, and the water level has gradually receded, and the small ferries have resumed normal operations. (July 13th)</p>

<p>The county government received a letter from Wei Peimin, director of the recruitment office of the police department of the headquarters, stating that there is a clear order prohibiting recruitment in Wuxian County. The office only has a reception center for new recruits, specializing in receiving and sending new recruits recruited from other places. Recently, it has been discovered that unscrupulous individuals are holding banners and forcibly recruiting in the name of the office, which violates regulations and tarnishes the reputation of the office. In addition to ordering Hong Qingyu, a member of the first recruitment team, to strictly investigate and arrest them, a corresponding letter is sent for your information, so that in the future, anyone who recruits on the streets with banners should be stopped and investigated to maintain local order.</p>

<p>Since the county education bureau received a report from inspector Xu Xihuang of the education department, as many as forty late-stage elementary schools have been cut, as well as funding for county middle schools and county normal schools, which will be implemented from the fiscal year of 1931. The local education community and students' families were surprised to hear the news, believing that the inspector's destruction of education would affect students' opportunities for admission and the livelihood of teachers and staff. On the 14th, a joint meeting of all county elementary and middle school teachers and staff was held in the education association's meeting hall to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to telegraph the central party headquarters, the national government, the ministry of education, the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, the education department, the county party headquarters, and the education bureau to appeal for their support. It was also decided to telegraph the education community in various counties for unified support. Wang Zhewu, Chen Guisan, Cai Fucheng, Sun Zongkun, and Xu Renson were appointed to draft the telegram. Chen Guisan, Xu Renson, Wang Sunqin, Zhu Zhu, and Shen Fusun were appointed as representatives to be responsible for hosting everything and actively proceeding. The students' families will also unite and strive to seek opportunities for their children to study, in line with the central government's promotion of universal education.</p>

<p>In Pengzhuang Village, fifteenth neighborhood, second district of this county, the homes of Gao Lian'gen, Gao Ziqing, and Li Yinxiang were suddenly visited by more than ten robbers, speaking in local and Jiangbei dialects, armed with long guns and carrying shoulder poles. Li Yinxiang's mother was beaten and injured. As a result, Gao Da'gen's house was robbed of more than thirty yuan in foreign currency and leather clothing, silverware, and other items. Gao Ziqing's and Li Yinxiang's houses also suffered significant losses. The robbers escaped with the loot. It is said that the robbers came from the southeast and their whereabouts are unknown. Fei Fusheng, the head of the district, has reported the incident to the county government for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<p>Hengsha, the sixth district under Chuansha County, is isolated on the coast, and pirates often covet it. To prevent such occurrences, the people of the district organized a defense force two years ago, engaging in training to deter threats. Recently, they have added a large number of firearms, increasing their strength, and set up sentry posts at various ports and main roads, rotating on duty.

<p>On the twelfth of this month, there was a strong wind and heavy rain here, lasting for a full day and night. Not only did the water rise in the river, but many dilapidated houses and utility poles were also damaged. The west prison in the old county market had been built for a long time and was in poor condition. Because the new prison was under construction, repairs had been neglected. Unexpectedly, after this rainstorm, the water inside accumulated to more than a foot. On the twelfth, a strong wind caused the wall of the number one cell in the south of the prison to collapse with a loud crash, startling the guards and prisoners. Fortunately, the wall fell outward, and no prisoners were injured. After checking the prisoners, there were no escapes. The guards immediately moved the prisoners from the damaged cell to another cell and quickly reported to the public security substation, requesting that police be sent to suppress any unrest. The next day, Fan Qi, the chief of the substation, submitted a report to the county government on the damage to the wall and immediately expedited repairs to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>Since the continuous rain, low-lying areas have become wetlands, and villages have reported the disaster situation to the county government. Unexpectedly, there was another wind and rainstorm on the twelfth, lasting a full day and night, causing the water to rise several more feet. Farmers were building dikes and trying to pump water out of the fields, but they were hit again, causing great hardship to the villagers. As for transportation, it could have been restored in three days, but now it will be extended again. However, the ferry companies are only interested in profit and are still secretly operating. Some are even traveling secretly at night, which the villagers cannot prevent, causing significant damage to the dikes in the Wuta area. Therefore, Zhang Dekang, the head of the district, upon the villagers' repeated requests, has petitioned the county government, requesting that it order the ferry companies to stop operating the ferries. Also, the Jinjiang Ferry of the Huitong Company, carrying passengers, tried to come to Changshu from Suzhou on the morning of the thirteenth. To avoid the villagers' mischief, it detoured into Yangcheng Lake. Unexpectedly, when the ferry came out of Hengjingtang, it was spotted by villagers, who gathered dozens of people and surrounded the Jinjiang Ferry with several small boats, intending to destroy its machinery. The bookkeeper and others tried their best to dissuade them and offered to pay the farmers 20 yuan for the dike construction fee, which calmed the situation down. Unexpectedly, before it had traveled even a mile, it was stopped again. After pleading and slowly passing through, it was again stopped near Zhangjiadian, where more farmers had gathered and insisted on stopping. The ferry personnel pleaded as before, but the farmers ignored them. Soon, dozens of people surrounded the ferry and used yellow stones and wooden sticks to beat it, resulting in the destruction of the glass windows on both sides and a large hole in the bow of the ship. At this point, the passengers were terrified and agreed to hire a private boat back to Changshu. The Jinjiang Ferry remained there. Fortunately, the passengers were unharmed. In the southern village, the disaster situation has been reported to the county by the seventh district farmers' association, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate.</p>

<p>Sun Xiangfu, the sixth team leader of the second district of the Wuxi-based provincial water police force, and Yuan Zishun, the leader of the first squad under his command, received a report the other day that several habitual thieves were hiding outside the West Gate. Upon receiving the report, Yuan led detectives to arrest them. First, they apprehended Zhou, a thief, in workshop number eight at 9-Jian-Tou outside the West Gate. Then, they apprehended Yan, a villager from Zhaimen, and Gu, a villager from Zhangmiaoshe, near Xilijiao. All of them were taken to the team for strict interrogation. They confessed to the robberies at Chenjiaqiao, Xiaoshiqiao, and Maojiaqiao, and the shooting of Pu, the owner of Zhangsheli, without hesitation. Yesterday, they were presented to the district office and then transferred to the county court for trial.</p>

<p>Xue Mansheng, a well-known playboy in this county, lives in Shengping Lane and is the youngest son of Xue Jialu, the chief accountant of the Chong Yongtai Silk Factory. He usually dresses in Western suits and specializes in harassing respectable women. At 2 p.m. yesterday, Mansheng went to the Wuxi Grand Theater in the park to watch a movie without buying a ticket and strode straight in. He was stopped by Yu A'gen, the ticket taker, who refused to let him in. Xue became enraged and beat Yu with his cane. The theater was in chaos. The theater requested the police to take both parties to the Public Security First Sub-bureau. Gao, the sub-bureau chief, conducted a preliminary interrogation. Because Xue Mansheng had repeatedly caused trouble and ignored warnings, he ordered a letter to be prepared to send him to the relief home and then to the civilian labor institute to be assigned a number and taken in.</p>

<p>The Wuyi County Education Administration Conference decided that the education budget for the 20th year of the Republic had a shortfall of 60,000 yuan that could not be made up, so it was decided that all education funding, except for community education funding, would be issued at 90% of the original amount, and the balance would be made up after revenue was received. If this decision became a reality, the schools would face many difficulties. At the joint county-school conference, it was unanimously agreed to protest and appoint Zhuang Ruzhen, Chen Hua, and Jiang Mianzhai as representatives to petition the department not to approve the decision. On the 14th, the three representatives went to the province by car and submitted their petition. Yang, the department director, met with them. After the three representatives presented their views, Director Yang acknowledged that issuing 90% of the funding was not a proper method and advocated starting with increasing revenue to remedy the situation. If the county really had no other way, then education was a sacrifice, and they would only be advised to try their best. However, the education bureau had not yet submitted the proposal to the department, so the department had no record to go on. The three representatives had to leave and return to Changzhou. A meeting will be held on the 17th to discuss what attitude to take after this.</p>

<p>The county police team received a report the other day that Hu Yunqing, a notorious kidnapper with the nickname "Night Blooming Flower," from Tanggou Township, Guanshan, a native of Xiagang, had been a pig butcher in Shanghai in the past. The former Provisional Court had issued a reward of 1,000 yuan for his arrest. His gang member, Xu A'gao, was hiding in the home of his deceased uncle, Xu Rongchang, holding meetings and plotting wrongdoing. Team Leader Yin immediately dispatched Liang Bingsheng, the leader of the first squad, and Ma Huaizhong, the leader of the fourth squad, to lead a team to Tangjiawan, where they arrested Xu A'gao and Yu Zilong and seized a large knife and two cavalry sabers. They were taken to the county on the evening of the 12th. After interrogation by Wu, the interrogating officer, Xu A'gao claimed that he had a feud with Xu Huatang, the village head, over water entering the fields and water passing through the fields, and falsely accused him. After the interrogation, Xu A'gao was detained, and Yu Zilong was released on bail.</p>

<p>The land in Nanzao, Juegang, is low-lying. Ever since the Huafeng Company built a dike to cultivate the land, the water has been prevented from flowing eastward into the sea whenever there is a flood. The villagers have suffered without compensation but have dared not speak out for fear of the company's power. Recently, there have been continuous heavy rains, and the Nanzao area has become a wetland. The villagers were extremely angry and gathered thousands of people to open the company's dike. The sixth regiment of the local militia, fearing accidents, sent a team to suppress them. Unexpectedly, the fifth regiment of the Huafeng Company opened fire, wounding one of the sixth regiment's militia members. It is reported that the injured militia member will be sent to the county government by the regiment for examination.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, Liyang has had continuous rain for ten days, and the river water has risen several feet. Low-lying areas have become wetlands, and dikes have been washed away. The weather cleared on the previous two days, and there was still some hope for the higher fields, but unexpectedly, dark clouds gathered again last night, and the heavy rain continued throughout the night without stopping. The city streets were ankle-deep in water, and the seedlings in the higher fields were also submerged, with a vast expanse of water everywhere. The flooding this year is even worse than in the thirty-second year of the Guangxu Emperor. Even if the weather clears immediately, it will be difficult to salvage the situation. In this situation, famine is inevitable, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The famine in the spring of this year had already caused great hardship to the farmers, and the flooding will only make things worse.</p>

<p>The Yuan Da small steamer serves as a ferry to Jiuligeng in Xiaguan. Recent river flooding has placed the Jiuligeng embankment in critical danger. Farmers have prohibited its operation, leading to a shortened route to Tongjiangji on the north bank. It is reported that the first boat yesterday morning (the 13th) departed from Xiaguan towards the north bank. While navigating the river's center, the steamer was overturned by wind and waves, resulting in the vessel's complete sinking. The number of fatalities remains unknown.

<p>The Englishman Meyfarth has resided in Hangzhou for several decades under the guise of missionary work and medical practice. He has illegally and in violation of agreements, extensively acquired real estate. During the Northern Expedition in Zhejiang in the sixteenth year of the Republic, all his properties were confiscated. Recently, Meyfarth, believing that the circumstances have changed, has been actively seeking their return. The central government has instructed the Zhejiang provincial government to investigate and handle the matter. Considering that foreigners owning property inland is prohibited by treaty, it is tentatively permitted to sell the properties to Chinese individuals at a fair price. However, Meyfarth has a considerable number of henchmen, including those who willingly flatter foreigners like slaves, who are acting as fronts to take over the purchases. Rumors are spreading, causing public outcry. The Provincial Relief Institute once petitioned to have the properties allocated to the institute as a fund. It is now learned that disputes have arisen among these sham foreign slaves over the distribution of the properties, potentially leading to litigation. Consequently, others are also contemplating intervention, hoping to reap the benefits. Yesterday, the institute continued to petition the Department of Civil Affairs to redeem the properties at the original price, thereby upholding government authority and preventing malicious practices by treacherous people.</p>

<p>Following the resurgence of bandit activity in Pingkeng and Huixi villages along the border between Yu and Feng, banditry in Siming Mountain has also erupted. The area, bordering Sheng and Feng counties, is characterized by a continuous mountain range extending over a hundred li, renowned as a natural stronghold. Bandits have occupied this territory. Recently, bandit groups from Xinchang and Sheng counties, having been severely suppressed by the Sixth Regiment of the Peace Preservation Corps, have fled to Siming Mountain, engaging in arson, kidnapping, and the rape of women, escalating the situation. Wealthy families in nearby villages have relocated, while many impoverished residents have aligned themselves with the bandits. The mere mention of the area evokes fear and suspicion. Recently, a certain Mi from Dongjia'an and a certain Dong from Xiahuang village in Sheng county were kidnapped by bandits, who sent letters demanding ransom.</p>

<p>Recent continuous heavy rains have caused the Chicken Crowing and Siding mountains in the west to flood eastward, while the inland river tides of Lake Chao have surged westward. The torrential downpour over the past week has resulted in water backing up into the city. The areas around Xiaodongmen, Xiaoyaojin, Jiushiqiao, and Wanshou Palace have been transformed into a watery expanse. Collapsed walls and houses are common, and reports of people being crushed and killed are frequent. Outside Xiaodongmen, entire households are submerged. The area around Dawangmiao, Zhougudui, and the southeastern villages extending over ten li is completely flooded. Numerous village houses have collapsed, leaving victims exposed on higher ground and in boats, presenting a scene of utter misery. The households on the embankment of the foreign docks outside Dadongmen are also submerged. The Li Xiaowei and Da Yaowan attached to the city have been breached. All the small Sunjia, Cheng Ma, and Huli embankments along the lake and river have collapsed. The most fortified Dongda embankment is also in imminent danger. The Hefei-Wuhu small steamer has temporarily suspended service since the 7th due to obstructions to the embankment. The Hefei-Chao and Hefei-Bengbu buses have also temporarily suspended operations due to road damage. The county government today ordered the embankment chiefs of the remaining intact embankments to oversee the urgent construction and reinforcement of the embankments. However, most of the crops have already been ruined. The unprecedented fire in Hefei has not even been a month ago, and now this ruthless flood has occurred, truly a case of misfortunes never coming singly.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper's local news report of the 12th of this month concerning the "Misunderstanding of Jiashan Xitang Water Police Seizing Opium," there are discrepancies between the report and the facts. Upon investigation, on the afternoon of the 8th of this month, a patrol from our detachment was dispatched to the well-known opium den of Yang Xin'guan (also known as Yang San'guan) on Xijie Street in this town to apprehend opium offenders. It happened that Lu Baozhi, the district chief of the Third District of Jiashan, was smoking opium in the den. Upon seeing the police enter the building, he hastily jumped out the back window and fled. The water police, recognizing the escaping individual as a district chief, believed it would affect their reputation and did not pursue him. At the time, only the den owner, Yang Xin'guan, was arrested, along with a straw hat left behind by Mr. Lu, and they were turned over to the Jiashan County Court for investigation. As for our detective Xu Gang (also known as Xu Mazi), due to a false accusation, he was indeed suddenly arrested by the Fifth Company of the Second Regiment of the Jiangsu Security Corps on the morning of the 1st of this month. After investigation by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters stationed in Songjiang, Jinshan, and Jiashan, it was confirmed that he was falsely accused, and he was released and returned to the detachment on the 11th of this month, resuming his duties as usual. The arrest of opium offenders and the arrest of our detective are two separate issues, with no connection between them. Moreover, the district office and the Yang surname opium den are located in Nan Hai and Xijie Street respectively, separated by a considerable distance across the river and street. If District Chief Lu Baozhi had not been illegally smoking opium in the den, our detachment would not have involved him without reason. We are sending this letter specifically so that your newspaper may investigate and publish a correction, thereby clarifying the facts.</p>

<p>Regret Over Inability to Go to Liaoning</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Northern Expedition Track and Field Team returned triumphantly at 7:30 AM yesterday morning. They defeated the Central team in Nanjing, Tianjin in the north, and Luhu in Beiping, achieving three victories in three battles, which is highly commendable. However, stopping in Tianjin and Beiping and not being able to go through the pass and shake hands with Liaoning and Shenyang is a matter of utmost regret for all the athletes. They hold it in their hearts, and can only wait to meet again at the National Games. Yesterday, I met with the team leader, Wang Fudan, to discuss the situation of the expedition as follows:</p>

<p>The Jiangnan Track and Field Team's Northern Expedition plan was formulated as early as early June. On June 10th, the Sports Association sent letters to Zhang Boling in Tianjin, Ma Yuehan in Beiping, and Hao Gengsheng in Shenyang. Tianjin replied by telegram, expressing a sincere welcome to compete and immediately began preparations. Beiping stated that it lacked organization and it would be difficult to have a competition. Ma Yuehan was then requested to use his best efforts to mediate. The Liaoning side stated that due to the major examinations, the competition could only be held on July 5th. As the team had made this arrangement, it was scheduled to go north on the 24th. However, due to the issue of the Ma Lingsi match, the departure was delayed until the 27th, assuming that they would be able to catch the Shenyang competition on July 5th.</p>

<p>The Northern Expedition team arrived in Tianjin on the 30th. Heavy rain was pouring down. There were concerns that they would miss the Shenyang date, so there was a proposal to go through the pass first and then return to Tianjin and Beiping. Suddenly, news came that the two universities in Liaoning province were holding major examinations and needed until the 9th to finish. In this case, there was still plenty of time, so a quick letter was sent to Hao Gengsheng to inform him. One side telegraphed Zhang Lingjia, reporting the date of the trip to Shenyang. Unexpectedly, like a bolt out of the blue, a quick letter was received from Hao stating that the Association in Shanghai had not telegraphed back to confirm the date, and that the Northeast University team was going to Harbin for practice, so the competition could only be cancelled. The Tianjin side felt that since an agreement had been made beforehand, this sudden cancellation was suspicious. Later, it was learned that the Northeast team did not depart until the 17th. The entire team felt deeply regretful that the Northeast could not have practice competitions. An excerpt from Hao's original letter is as follows: "However, because the universities are currently undergoing major examinations, the competition can only be held on July 5th. Earlier or later dates are inconvenient. I then telegraphed the Shanghai National Association for approval. It has been ten days, and there has been no reply. On the evening of the 26th of last month, I sent a telegram to Mr. Shen Siliang in my personal capacity. Yesterday, I received a letter from the Association stating that the team is about to leave. (Omission) Please convey to the team that the confrontation in Liaoning is practically impossible because no official response was received for a long time."</p>

<p>After the competition in Tianjin, they immediately went to Beiping. Beiping lacked organization and could not compete, so they leisurely toured the scenic spots and waited for several days. There was an alliance with Luhu to negotiate a competition. Luhu was the strongest team in Beiping, and no one could compete with them. Jiangnan won against them. According to Luhu, they had been preparing for a long time, but initially thought that Beiping would have an official team to compete. Unfortunately, this was not the case, so Luhu came out to fight.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Best Impression of Tianjin <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The best impression of the Northern Expedition was Tianjin. They were the most energetic, and the facilities and hospitality were excellent. The team members were all in good health. A total of three people did not return. Wang Zhengyin returned to Shenyang, Ma Fengrui was in Tai'an, and Zhou Ende stayed in Tianjin. The rest returned together. They are determined to practice hard and prepare to compete against strong enemies at the National Games.</p>

<p>Among Japanese university basketball teams, the University of Commerce, Rikkyo, and Waseda have been the strongest for seven years, and the University of Commerce has been the leader among the three. The university basketball combined competition only started in 1924. The three schools joined at that time. Two years later, Teidai and Chuo joined one after another to form a five-way alliance. The 1926, 1927, 1929, and 1930 championships all went to the University of Commerce. The Jingu Athletic Stadium stone monument commemorates this. This spring, the Philippine Santo Tomas team went to Japan, and although it lost to the University of Commerce, the score was very close.</p>

<p>(Snow Tower Sent from Java on June 8)</p>
<p>| Opponent | Batavia Interior Ministry Team... Result | 5-5 Draw</p>
<p>The reputation of the national football team in Java has been established by Lok Wah, creating a solid foundation. After tea and wine, whether in the conversations of Overseas Chinese, Europeans, or locals, one can occasionally hear discussions about Lok Wah's "football skills." The people of the South have always ridiculed me as a "declining old country." Since then, they have suddenly changed their mentality. It turns out that football is the "ultimate hobby" of the general public in Java, and it is able to win the interest and attention of the majority.</p>

<p>The news of the Hong Kong South China Athletic Association's football players breaking through the waves on a southern expedition was heard in Java, causing a sensation. The team of twenty-one arrived in Batavia from Singapore on June 6 and stayed at the Bo Ling Sheng Lan Hotel. They were extremely welcomed by the general "sports-crazed Overseas Chinese." It was heard that the team came from Hong Kong and passed through Saigon, where they fought three matches, winning two and drawing one. The results are recorded as follows: (1) South China won over the堤岸Players 5-0 (2) South China won over the嘉定Team 4-1 (3) South China drew with the Saigon Players 1-1</p>

<p>The host inviting South China to Java is the Batavia Youth Association, so before the team arrived in Batavia, the Youth Association was responsible for welcoming and entertaining them. The names of all twenty-one members of the South China team are as follows: Leader He Run Guang, Secretary Zeng Jinghou, Captain Bao Jiaping, Team Members Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Huang Jiliang, Tan Jiangbai, Liu Mao, Liang Rongzhao, Liang Rongde, Liang Yanzan, Huang Meishun, Zhang Guocai, Ye Beihua, Huang Jingcong, Zhu Guolun, Zheng Shaokang, Ye Guanling, Tang Kun, Li Tiansheng, Yang Shuiyi</p>

<p>On the second day after arriving in Batavia, the first battle was fought with the Batavia Interior Ministry team (Sporl Verenening Binenland Beslyur S V B B) at the "Batavia Stadium." Unfortunately, it was cloudy and rainy that day, and the rain only stopped when the game started, causing the stadium to be like a marsh. Although an hour of pumping water was carried out, the pools of water were still more than an inch deep, making it extremely difficult for both sides to run. At 4:40, the South China captain Bao Jiaping led the team out, full of vigor, like birds out of a cage, flying all over the field. Soon the Interior Ministry team also came out, led by Captain Fleming. After the two armies gathered, Youth Association President Lai Canhui gave a speech and presented flowers as gifts, and then took photos to commemorate.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Feng Jingxiang Opens the Record <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The referee blew the whistle to gather the teams. The two captains first chose the ground to deploy their formations. After Chairman Lai and the British Consul entered the field for the opening kick-off ceremony, the battle began. The South China forwards received the incoming ball and swarmed forward, directly reaching the heart of the Interior Ministry. However, the field was wet and the ball was slippery, making it difficult to control the ball as desired and difficult to cooperate, with no hope of breaking through the door. At this time, Feng Jingxiang dribbled the ball straight up and passed it to Li Huitang on the left. When the ball monster received the incoming ball, because the field was too slippery, it was impossible to stand firmly, making the shot inaccurate, and losing a good opportunity. The only thing that was obtained was a penalty corner kick, taken by Zheng Shaokang. Although the landing point was good, it was saved by the opposing defender and sent to the front line for a counterattack. The left pass and the right pass were also quite powerful, but when they reached the South China defense line, they were blocked by the water. Instead, General Tan captured the ball and passed it to the center. The right wing Zheng Shaokang received the ball and went straight to the break along the edge, and the four forwards chased together. The ball monster received the ball, with no chance to break the door, and immediately passed it to Feng, the center forward's foot. Feng, the center forward, did not disappoint the crowd, raised his foot and shot fiercely, and entered the net in response, opening the record. Applause rang out, sounding like thunder.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Enemy Wins Back Two Goals <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>At 4:55, the Interior Ministry launched a major counterattack, and Bao Tiemen's defense was not enough, so it was retaliated, with the score becoming one to one. After this draw, there was a fierce battle for about ten minutes, with neither side recording a goal. At 5:05, the Interior Ministry invaded, the center forward was careless, causing the enemy's right wing to break through, and the forwards went up together. The enemy center forward leaped and scored a point because he was too close, and Bao's door was unable to save it, and it actually entered the South China net corner again.</p>

<p>The triangular swimming competition between the Chinese Swimming Research Association, Xiqing, and the Japanese Sports Association is scheduled to be held on July 25th. The date is approaching. Xiqing has the naval force of the麦令司and the Japanese also have the Marine Corps. If China only faces them with the Swimming Research Association, its strength may not be enough. It is heard that it has been decided to organize a special team to resist. The members of the special team are planned to be Chen Jinpei, Li Mulong, Liang Guoquan, Chen Quandai, Jian Erming, Zeng Rongzeng, Li Chengyuan, Xia Deren, Chen Chunxiu, Xu Yaotang, Yu Binqi, etc. However, only Yu Binqi, Lu Shiying, Zhang Yunqi, Yin Yanjun, Tang Tianyan and others have registered, which is quite disappointing. The date is approaching, and the enemy's forces are very strong. It is heard that the host</p>

<p>The Chinese forwards used one breath to seek revenge, in a coordinated manner, in a雁Formation, and went straight to the fortress. The high ball flew over, but Zhu's right auxiliary's head skills were not good. Then they came back, using the border to advance the troops, which was very smooth. Center forward Feng chased to, with the opportunity not to be missed, raised his foot and shot fiercely, the ball entered the net again, making it two to two. At 5:15, center forward Feng received a wonderful ball from Zhu's right auxiliary, and shot fiercely at the goal, hitting the target with one kick, and winning another goal. South China continued to attack fiercely, using the long-distance passing method. Left wing Ye got the ball and passed it to the center. The ball monster sent it to the right wing from afar. General Zheng took advantage of the empty defense line to go deep. Center forward Feng chased to, leaped and topped the ball, and the trend of the ball formed a horizontal line with the Dragon Gate. The momentum was as strong as a bullet and went straight into the net. General Feng won three consecutive victories, making the score four to two. In the first half, South China took a 4-2 lead.</p>

<p>At 5:35, after quenching their thirst with lemonade, the two sides changed positions and continued to battle. At this moment, the entire audience, seeing the South China frontline so sharp, predicted that the Internal Affairs Department would be completely defeated, not even a piece of armor spared. Who knew that the result would be the complete opposite? Although the Internal Affairs Department had already suffered a defeat, their spirit was not diminished. They exerted tremendous effort before and after to fight. Sure enough, after continuing to attack, the Internal Affairs Department's frontline surged like a tide, directly into South China's crucial pass. Center-back Huang Meishun returned to defend and accidentally collided with the enemy's left midfielder. The referee ruled that he had violated the rules and awarded a penalty kick. The executioner was the fierce right-winger Das. Although the goalkeeper was an expert in saving penalty kicks, he could not withstand his attack. As the whistle blew, the ball went into the net. After this loss, the South China side's formation was slightly chaotic, with many weaknesses in the center-back position. The Internal Affairs Department's coordinated attacks from front and back resulted in a 4-4 tie. The Internal Affairs Department knew that their strength was not as good, and victory was hopeless. It was fortunate to be able to maintain a tie. Soon, the Internal Affairs Department scored another goal, and South China was defeated. They urgently sought revenge. Li Qiuqi received a pass from General Zheng and shared some credit with Center Forward Feng, seizing the opportunity to shoot and making it a 5-5 tie at the end.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Research on Lips</p>
<p>There is a professor in Germany who has conducted in-depth scientific research on human lips. According to him, the structure of each person's lips is closely related to their personality. It is not only related to personality, but also to occupation. For example, the female operators in telephone companies often have full and extremely soft lips, and the sounds they utter are solid and extremely clear. In the world, all foolish and barbaric races have very thick lips. Those famous great thinkers all have thin lips. However, there are some uncivilized and ignorant savage races whose lips are also thin. Therefore, the world is so big that there is nothing strange. Even in the case of lips, there cannot be a general conclusion.</p>
<p>The Water of the Ganges</p>
<p>Indians call their Ganges River the Holy River. The water in the Ganges is also regarded as fairy water. It is beneficial to the human body to drink it. Therefore, ordinary men and women of faith are happy to drink the fairy water. Recently, scientists have tested it and found that the mold in the river does have the ability to kill many kinds of germs. Look at the turbidity of the river water, which is obviously unsanitary. Who knew that there would be such a special mold, which made those scientists very suspicious. The Tropical School of Medicine in Calcutta has studied it in detail. It is said that if this kind of mold is artificially propagated, it can be used for medical treatment in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e159">A Tragic and Enthusiastic Aid-Overseas Chinese Assembly <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>All circles in this city, because of the inhumane massacre of overseas Chinese by Koreans, held a meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the 13th of this month to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue: The national flag of the Kuomintang was hung high at the gate. Armed guards stood on the left and right. The scene was very solemn. The venue was in the conference hall on the second floor. A registration desk was set up at the entrance. After signing in, each person was given a printed item, "An Appeal to Compatriots of All Circles in the Country by Fellow Koreans in Shanghai," which contained titles such as "The Heartbreaking Korean Anti-Chinese Activities," "The Extremely Dangerous Situation of Overseas Chinese," "The Cruel Killing 丨丨 Dissecting Hearts and Gouging Out Eyes," "The Dangerous Violence 丨丨 Burning and Looting," "Overseas Chinese Seeking Refuge Are Massed Like Mountains and About to Run Out of Food," and "The Situation Is Deteriorating Day by Day and Is Precarious," which made it unbearable to read.</p>
<p>Various Slogans: This Korean riot was entirely instigated by the Japanese. Therefore, the slogans posted inside and outside the venue on that day were all directed at Japan. Excerpts are as follows: "The Wanbaoshan Incident was a Premeditated Conspiracy by the Japanese," "Demand That the Government Implement Revolutionary Diplomacy," "The Wanbaoshan Incident is an Excuse for the Japanese to Send Troops to the Northeast," "Compatriots, Rise Up and Destroy This Korea," "The Wanbaoshan Incident is a Prelude to the Japanese Aggression of Manchuria and Mongolia," "National Crisis Has Arrived, Compatriots, Wake Up Quickly," "All Circles Unite to Confront Japan as a Diplomatic Backing," "With a Spirit of Perseverance and Courage, We Will Forever Break Off Economic Relations with Japan."</p>
<p>Weeping Bitterly: Mr. Yang, an overseas Chinese from Japan, reported on the Japanese conspiracy against China, speaking in Cantonese. He said with great anger that he had been in Japan for more than ten years and had been in contact with the Japanese, knowing that they had been plotting against China with ulterior motives. It is difficult to describe their sinister methods in one word. The Koreans have always succumbed to the accumulated power of Japan and have always adhered to the scope of their actions, not daring to overstep the bounds, and only following the lead of the Japanese. Without the instigation of the Japanese, the Koreans would never have had the courage to riot so greatly. While speaking, he gesticulated and wept bitterly, urging compatriots from all walks of life to wake up together. Otherwise, the Japanese would gain ground and their harm would be unimaginable. The listeners were moved.</p>
<p>Shouting Loudly: Mr. Linken Youren, the director-general of the Foreign Aid Association for the Netherlands, said in his speech that China has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population. Compared with Japan, which has only three islands, it is like comparing heaven and earth. Today, the Japanese are so tyrannical and have no regard for China. If we continue to endure without devising countermeasures, it is tantamount to the death of the national spirit. There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart. Today's matter, although nominally a Korean anti-Chinese movement, is actually a Japanese plot to annex China. Koreans are puppets of the Japanese and should be pitied for their ignorance and being used by others. To catch thieves, catch the king. We must deal with Japan with all our strength. He also listed the various inferior acts of the Japanese against China since Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor and presented the Twenty-One Demands, hitting the table again and again with his hand, shouting loudly, excited and慷慨, making people excited.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Rattlesnake of Qujiang <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>A guest from Qujiang in Lingnan told of the production of rattlesnakes in his area. The snake is very poisonous, seven or eight feet long, with a ring-shaped object at the end of its tail that can make a sound, a shrill sound like a cicada singing on a summer willow. It likes to eat lychees, winding among the trees, and those with many fruits are eaten to the end. It eats 300 lychees a day. Even Su Shi is inferior to its good fortune. In a certain year, when the lychees were ripe, there were many snakes. The owner of the orchard was worried and tried to feed cranes to eliminate them. The cranes were exhausted, and there was no way to recruit more. Some people used paper cranes to guard the lychees. The cranes ate the snakes, and the red top of the crown looked like blood poison accumulated there. A certain servant did not notice and touched it, and his wrist and elbow swelled up immediately, extending to the whole body and dying. Alas, the poison of the rattlesnake! The snake comes out at night. The guest prepared a hunting gun. Late at night, he heard the sound of a snake, happily pushed his pillow and got up. He went out to track the sound and shot it. Although it was dark and indistinguishable, he saw several tails lying stiff on the ground the next morning. The guest was familiar with marksmanship, so he was able to hit the target eight or nine times out of ten. When the guest talked about this, he raised his eyebrows and waved his arms, with the air of the pavilion chief of Sishang beheading the son of the White Emperor.</p>

<p>Mei Lanfang's trip to the south this time, time is easy, almost three months have passed. At the beginning, he was hired by Nantian and embarked on a journey to Zhuhai, performing twice in Hong Kong and Guangdong. Everyone was empty, no less than in those years. Since returning from the Americas, it was the first time to meet with the southern people. When he passed through Shanghai, he stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel for two days. He stayed in Hong Kong and Guangdong for 30 days before and after. He also took the opportunity to go to Zhongshan County to visit Cui Tingxiang and visit the Gongle Garden to see the construction and achievements of this model county. Then, he rushed to attend the ceremony of the Du Family Ancestral Hall and performed for three days. Mr. Yuesheng had the grand wish to set up a library to benefit the scholars, so he specially purchased 500 copies of the exquisite printed edition of the Guangya Congshu Complete Collection from Guangdong to donate to him. Mei is simple and elegant, and respects learning and admires the ancients. One is to observe the prosperity of the Du Family Hall, and the other is to promote the heart of benefiting the people. Both are commendable. When he came to Shanghai, he was hosted by the Du Family and stayed at the Central Hotel. After the performance, he was originally scheduled to return north. However, he traveled south in the past. He never had the opportunity to see the scenery of Jiangnan. He felt regretful. Coincidentally, he had a friend who invited him to visit the Holy Lake Yuhang together. He went to Hangzhou with Mr. Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng, as well as Mr. Wang Hu and other gentlemen. He stayed for several days and took a long-distance bus to Mogan Mountain. He went around to see the scenery. He turned to Yuhang and went to Dongxi Tianmu, where he explored the forests. He stayed in the temple for three days and respectfully drew Buddha statues to leave as a souvenir. He made offerings. The devotees and Buddhas were all very happy. The grandeur of the dragon and elephant was rare. When he returned from Hangzhou, it was already midsummer and he could not stay. However, the philanthropists of Shanghai, because Jiangxi was in urgent need of disaster relief, planned to raise money to help. Xiong Tianyi, the commander of the Shanghai garrison, also sent a telegram from Jiangxi, urging him to help the people of Jiangxi survive. Mei had the people in mind and was saddened by the news. He immediately agreed. So, he performed again at the Grand Stage for three days. 30,000 yuan was sold in tickets. The summer was hot and there were no empty seats. The Huahlau was 100 yuan, and the third floor was only about 1 yuan, which was unprecedented. It was the Shanghai people who were determined to do justice, and it was also the power of Mei's call. Mei is still young, and his appearance is not inferior to ten years ago. His voice is clearer and more durable, singing high into the clouds without any difficulty. Insiders believe that his voice is like this today, and it will not change throughout his life. This is a great blessing for those who appreciate music and coordinate rhythm. The day after the end of the performance, he put aside his business and hurriedly set off. Therefore, I wrote a short note on his itinerary to inform him, and also as a ticket for his return in the autumn.</p>
<p>Short message: Huang Hanhou, Guangling, is a young and handsome man who is proficient in four styles of calligraphy and is good at shallow engraving. He can engrave more than a thousand characters in an inch-square ivory card, as fine as mosquitoes' feet. He is especially good at engraving fans, with those who write the Former and Latter Chapters on Dispatching the Army and the Former and Latter Odes to the Red Cliff, and those who write the Preface to the Sacred Religion and the Preface to the Collection of the Orchid Pavilion and Thirteen Postscripts, each imitating its style, with vivid charm. The fan is no more than a foot long and only a few points wide, but the spacing is even and meticulous. Those with slightly dull eyesight cannot see the inscriptions and seals, which contain the four words "a lifetime of effort," without a microscope. It is said that on the 18th of this month, he will display hundreds of his carefully crafted works at the Ningbo Fellow Association 4 and open the exhibition for three days.</p>
<p>Statement: In yesterday's "He Han Er" manuscript, the 15th line has an empty lead, which is actually the word "mosquito". It was corrected in the proofs, but it was omitted temporarily. This is a special statement.</p>

<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>What Koreans feel most tragic is the high pressure of Japanese economic power in the past 20 years. Up to now, except for a few nobles and the bourgeoisie, the vast majority of the people feel the difficulty of life. The national economic strength is completely in the hands of the Japanese. No matter what skills you have, you cannot get rid of this restraint. Although it is not a natural formation, it cannot be recovered by human power. Alas, the tragedy of national subjugation. Koreans only now understand that it is a pain to the flesh. However, it is too late to regret. The productive capacity of Koreans is also weak. In the city, they cannot see a large company, large business, or large factory founded by themselves. In the Korean street in Seoul, only small businesses are seen, selling handmade household utensils. There are not many shops with capital of more than 1,000 yuan. The lively business districts, the prosperous markets, and the large capital businesses are completely concentrated in the Japanese street. Even the Chinese street business is very quiet. They have all been affected by Japanese economic aggression. If you want to describe the state of Koreans being economically oppressed, it is like a person who is terminally ill. It is in danger. Now, it is urgent for a good doctor to perform surgery and cure it from the root.</p>
<p>Korean customs are still conservative and have not been assimilated by the Japanese. For example, the four major needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, except for transportation, all rely on their own supply. The most special custom of Koreans is that they wear white clothes all year round. Men, old and young, are all the same. Some people say that this is not only their custom, but also contains the meaning of "never forget national humiliation". The long shirts worn by men are buttoned together in front of the chest and have two ties. White cloth socks and rubber shoes. The elderly also add a black hat. The skirts worn by women are very long, while the shirts only reach the waist. They are also buttoned together in front of the chest and tied a knot. Middle-aged women and above also wear a white cloth scarf. The clothing materials are mostly cotton woven white cloth. In summer, it is linen. Fashionable women only use white silk. Very few people wear Japanese kimonos and clogs. The intellectual class also wears Western clothes. Seeing that they are not particular about clothing, and most of the sources of clothing are local products. The main agricultural product of Korea is rice. A large amount of rice is exported to Japan every year. Their own food is supplied by the millet of the three northeastern provinces. Therefore, the Korean farmers who cultivate in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang in our country transport a considerable amount of grain back to Korea every year. Korean cigarettes and alcohol are monopolized by the Governor-General's Office. Koreans have a deep love for this and therefore consume a lot. In the eyes of the Japanese, they believe that the profits and taxes from tobacco and alcohol are a huge source of income. Speaking of the housing problem of Koreans, it is worth studying. Try crossing the Tsushima Strait from Shimonoseki, Japan, to Busan, Korea, and taking the train all the way to Sinuiju. You can cross the Korean Peninsula in one day and night. The scene of the countryside along the way seems very desolate. The civilian houses are all small thatched huts with mud or reed walls. Occasionally, you can see a few white-walled tile houses, which are said to be the residences of Japanese people. Most of the people living in tile houses are landlords and capitalists. They have a great potential in the countryside, as if they have the right to command ordinary farmers. It can be seen that the power of the Japanese has penetrated deep into the hinterland and expanded to the people.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>So, after a year, the ink on the inkstone dried up. He ground it again, intending to continue working. Unexpectedly, the mistress, who was like a drama onstage, came upstairs again. When Ziliang looked, he couldn't help but feel a little strange. It turned out that she was holding a small child in her arms and was smiling at her husband.</p>
<p>"Look! Is this child good-looking?"</p>
<p>Ziliang, who had been married for three years without children, was really curious:</p>
<p>"Whose child is this?"</p>
<p>"Haha! This is my son. Don't you recognize him?"</p>
<p>As the mistress spoke, she turned the child's face towards Ziliang.</p>
<p>"Good child, call him 'Daddy'!"</p>
<p>Ziliang looked closely at the child's face and knew that it seemed to be the Wang family next door.</p>
<p>"What a joke! A father wouldn't recognize his own son."</p>
<p>As the mistress spoke, she sat on the chair, unbuttoned her chest, exposed her left breast, and put the nipple into the child's mouth:</p>
<p>"Good child! Eat!"</p>
<p>Ziliang found the mistress's actions a bit ridiculous. Unexpectedly, the child couldn't get any milk at that time, and he started to cry, and he was crying loudly. Ziliang couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"Whose child is this? What are you doing bringing him over? He's crying! Hurry up and return him! Otherwise, if they hear us, they might not agree!"</p>
<p>The mistress also felt that there was nothing she could do. Although she was using her hand to tap on the edge of the desk, the child's crying still didn't stop. She had no choice but to carry him downstairs. There was already a knock on the front door.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the initial gold price was soft and then firm, but then it weakened again in the afternoon. The fluctuations were not small. There were periods of calm and periods of turmoil. A total of thirteen transactions were recorded. In the end, it fell slightly by more than two taels. The intentions of the industry were uncertain, and buying and selling were still different. The silver market rose slightly, especially because Germany's economy was in dire straits. Fortunately, the United States resolutely helped and there was talk of assistance, which led to a downward trend in gold prices. Moreover, due to swap relations, many parties were afraid of paying out, so sellers became more constant. Then, the price suddenly broke through the 740 tael mark and soared by more than ten taels, almost reaching fifty taels. There were also reports that the German debt issue had encountered obstacles, so people's hearts were turned upwards. However, there were occasional three or four tael spreads. The market was initially stable, but later it softened due to heavy selling. Finally, it was at 41 or 42 taels. However, it was Wednesday and the foreign exchange market was weak. The August to September rollover was due, but there was no prior private opening, because the exchange had strictly prohibited it. If there was any deliberate violation, it would be punished according to the newly revised regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Once Retreated to the 40 Tael Mark <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The opening price for August this morning dropped slightly by two taels to 742 taels. The large return was a sixteenth and the silver price added an eighth. However, the private telegrams did not change, and the market was flat. There were also many sellers, followed by 40 taels. Then, Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing, and others bought in, and the price immediately increased to 44 taels. Later, Yuanmao Yong, Tianfeng Yong, Wanxing, and others sold off one after another. Moreover, British gold turned unfavorable, initially at 25 (September), and then the recent 25, both in and out were possible. Moreover, the Dalian Ticket Bank's purchase price was initially 1 tael 5 mace 9 fen 7.5 li, then 9 fen 5 li to 3.75 li, so it fell by more than 7 taels, and finally settled at 36.5 taels at 9:20. When the British gold was announced, it did not change. The Japanese gold reported a large 2.25, and was bought in by Tong Taichang, Wanxing, and others, so it rose to 40 taels. Before long, it retreated to 38 taels 9 qian. In a moment, it rose by 2 or 3 taels. Then, Qian Changxiang, Yongheng, Fuyu, Tong Taichang, Yifeng Yong, Hengxing, and others agreed to buy in, and it continued to increase by more than 5 taels. Mitsui also ate Dalian at 1 tael 5 mace 9 fen 7.5 li. HSBC absorbed British gold at 2.25. Mai Xinghuabi and others sold at 1.875. The market was profitable. After 10:30, it was at 47 taels. Suddenly, it fell back by more than 2 taels, which was sold off by the hedging companies. Then it was at 44.5 taels. Later, Yuanmao Yong, Hengyu, Tong Taichang, Dadecheng, and others were all vying to buy in. Especially since British gold was even more strong, HSBC and others offered 1.875 to 1.25, so the industry was working very hard. Then, there was a rush to 50 taels. At 11:30, it was 49 taels 5 qian, but HSBC came to sell for hedging, and Daxing Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Qian Changxiang, Yuanheng, Shunli, Wanxing, and others all sold off, losing more than 2 taels. At noon, it was 46 taels 1 qian. The closing price was 6 taels 5 qian, and then it was raised to more than 7 taels. The announced price was changed to 784 taels 2 qian. It was estimated that it was suppressed from 45 taels to 35 taels, and 37 taels at noon.</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Evening Closing Only Fell by 2 Taels 8 Qian <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The after-market opening price was 48 taels, followed by 8 taels and a half. Then, the Indian exchange rate reported a small 2 anna. Then, there was another tael of odd spread, but the trading was limited. Until after 3 o'clock, from 47 taels, it gradually declined, because the Indian exchange rate reported a large 5 or 6 anna. The domestic parties and others dumped it, and at a quarter past 3, it was only 42 taels. In a moment, it increased to 40 taels and 8 qian, and there seemed to be more buyers. At 3:30, the trend suddenly became weak, because the atmosphere was not good. For today's swap, it was expected that short positions would be covered, so many longs had already sold off, and it fell by 3 taels 5 qian. At more than 20 minutes past 4, it finally settled at 41 taels 2 qian. By 4:30, the closing price was 41 taels and a half, which was estimated to have fallen by 2 taels compared to the day before. However, another tael was made larger, which was estimated to be 42 taels and a half. According to the largest price of the day, 49 taels and a half, and the smallest price, 36 taels and a half, there was an estimated difference of 12 taels.</p>

More than 2,000 bars were handled by the Tianjin Gang, which were sold by Yingfengh Heng, Dafeng Heng, and other gold shops. The price was 13 taels (plus the term bid delivery). Such a large amount of transactions is rare. However, the delivery will be in the next month.</p>

Speculator Mr. Wu stated that supply exceeded demand.</p>

German exchange fell back five yuan, totaling one hundred thirty-seven marks. Japanese gold increased by 0.025, totaling one tael, six mace, two fen, seven and a half li. The rest remained stable.

American gold saw minor transactions, while Japanese gold was sold by the Dalian group to Japanese banks for over one million yuan. Market sentiment remained stable, but conflicting international news caused the Shanghai market to stagnate and fluctuate.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market transactions and trading situation were quite subdued. Although the morning seemed more active, it was merely offsetting long and short positions among dealers, not genuine sales. Therefore, the outlook for foreign silver coins remained bleak, and silver borrowing rates were also low. Currently, demand is not urgent, and both supply and demand are slack, so clearing fees are just nominal, and silver borrowing rates remain at a few points.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local Chinese Securities Exchange formally began trading both spot and futures for the 20-year unified tax treasury bonds. However, apart from the July futures contract opening once in the morning, there were no further transactions, as these treasury bonds are not widely circulated in the market. As for the market for other bonds, spot transactions were scarce, while futures remained active. The buying and selling sentiment was as lively as before. The morning session was sluggish with no major fluctuations. In the two sessions around midday, market demand was stronger, and bond prices gradually firmed. However, the closing trend turned weaker as the overall bond market remained calm. Supply and demand were balanced, and price fluctuations were minimal. As a result, only customs bonds for August and small 1929 customs bonds each rose by one yuan, while others had mixed gains and losses, with amounts ranging from two to three jiao. The total futures turnover was over 18.8 million yuan, while spot transactions totaled only 12,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is very strong, with a dramatic price surge. The atmosphere of economic severance with Japan is again tense. Speculators are swarming in, and buying sentiment is very high. The upward trend is sharp. Although there are large firms selling off, retail investors are uniformly absorbing the supply. At the same time, actual sales in the north are vigorous. Some are stockpiling for the rainy day due to the growing boycott movement. The spot market is very tight. Recent transactions in branded yarn have been substantial, with considerable strength on both the long and short sides. Future changes are likely to be significant.</p>

<p>In the pre-market opening of the exchange's cotton market, the overseas cotton was flat and weak. However, the atmosphere in the market was very tight, and buying sentiment was strong. Prices rose by one to two taels for all months. Prices rose again in the second session, resulting in gains of 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7 qian for all months. The upward trend was even stronger in the afternoon opening. There was pressure from large firms in the second and third sessions, causing a slight pullback. Near-term contracts only rose by 0.3, 0.6, and 0.8 qian, while distant contracts were flat. Transactions totaled 83,650 bales sold. Dafu sold 1,600 bales, Yuda sold 1,200 bales, Daji sold 1,150 bales, Shenchang sold 1,150 bales, Hengde sold 2,150 bales, Yichang sold 4,600 bales, Xincheng sold 4,750 bales, Gongtai sold 1,350 bales, Taixing sold 1,200 bales, and Ruidai sold 1,400 bales.

<p>The cotton market is tightening. Although the situation for American cotton is still weak, the local conditions in Shanghai are affected by reports of continuous mold and rain and alleged damage to cotton in Shaanxi. Gold prices fluctuate sharply, making it difficult to predict. Therefore, market conditions are mixed. Japanese firms are tightly holding onto new, distant cotton contracts. The overall trend is still flat and soft. Progress depends on news regarding new cotton and American cotton.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially firmed due to good news from Liverpool, but weakened due to good weather and Wall Street's poor performance. Futures fell by one to six points, while spot prices remained unchanged. English cotton futures rose by eight to nine points, and spot prices rose by thirteen points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by ten points. Indian cotton firmed due to short covering and good news from Germany. The Pingguo'er rose by seven rupees, and the Aomula and Bailuoxi rose by five rupees. Original telegram recorded below (14th telegram):</p>

<p>Food: Rice Market in River Towns is Tight in the South and Soft in the North</p>

<p>Yesterday, various firms continued to receive shipments of Wuxi, Changzhou, Kunshan, thick japonica rice No. 12 and 13. There were also a dozen or so boats from Jiangyin and Yixing. The amount of Changshu northern japonica rice was also substantial. Transactions were limited. Although customer firms were active, the volume was not large. Prices for fresh goods remained unchanged. Prices for mid-grade goods were slightly lower due to thinner inventory. Thin rice varieties such as Shipu, Qingjiao, and Xitang had excellent transaction volume, reaching 2,000 to 3,000 dan. The river accumulation is nearly exhausted. Lupu pointed rice also shows signs of rising prices. There was little change in foreign pointed glutinous rice and glutinous rice. Tinglin and Zhangyan early rice are weak, showing signs of decline.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the source of goods for various firms was scarce. There was a slight amount of Puji old stock. Although the market situation in urban and rural stores improved due to the clear weather, deliveries were not timely. Therefore, the appetite for fresh goods remained high. Thick japonica rice prices rose sharply by one to two jiao, and the mid-range prices followed closely. Judging from the arrival and sales situation, the market was tight for high-grade goods and firm for second-grade goods. The inventory of thin rice was depleted, and the demand from Ningbo and local streets was also lacking, so prices further increased. Luyang pointed rice was considered not bad. The market situation was far from japonica rice prices, so the price increase was more significant. The arrival and sales of the Yin-hua variety were balanced with no significant gains or losses.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Flour Market Initially Weak, Then Firm <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was weak in the morning opening, with mixed price fluctuations in imported wheat. However, the overall fluctuation was less than a jiao. Due to poor sales, northern firms had some re-selling. Factories slightly increased purchases recently to prepare for direct shipments to various ports. Around 100,000 was sold in long-term contracts, so the market stabilized. In the afternoon, due to renewed rainfall, the sentiment of inland firms worsened. Local speculators took the opportunity to buy, causing near-term and long-term prices to rise again. Although actual sales are sluggish, inland firms are ultimately defending the bottom price, so they must remain persistent. As a result, this month was 0.075 better than the previous day, August and September were 0.05 better, October was 0.1 better, November was 0.075 better, and December was 0.125 better.</p>

<p>Spot Goods Sales Slow</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed signs of initially being flat and then firm. The prices of imported wheat were small, with Chicago up two to three cents, and Canada up 0.1. Some were cautious and watched the market. Because the gold market rose again, most people thought that imported wheat would be uneconomical and difficult to obtain. Inland firms ultimately decided not to relax easily due to the flood situation, so the market gradually became firm. However, the flow of current arrivals remains slow, so it is difficult for standard wheat to rise significantly. As a result, this month was 0.1 better than the previous day, August and September were 0.2 better, July was 0.3 better, November was 0.4 better, and December was 0.2 better. The spot wheat market remains flat. High-quality goods are priced at 5 qian, while mid-quality goods are priced between 0.2 and 0.3 qian. A total of 2,400+ bags of wheat from Kunshan, Danyang, Ben Niu, Shipu, Wangxianqiao, and Penglai were handled by Huafeng Fuxin.</p>
<p>Textiles: A Moveable Textile Market</p>
<h3 id="e194">Local Factory Cotton Cloth <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The market has been quite firm recently, and spot goods of fine cloth are nearly exhausted. This is because, after the Sichuan firms searched the market, the inventories were already depleted. In addition, firms from Niuzhuang and Tianjin successively made purchases. However, there are no warehouse receipts for brands such as Laba Tong and Blue Chicken. Goods will arrive in two to three weeks. The shortage of spot goods is evident from this. Yanghe sold for 7 taels and 6 qian yesterday, and Hunter sold for 7 taels, 5 qian, and 2.5 fen. Fine twill has also been rising since the group was combined. Yanghe opened at 7 taels, 6 qian, and 5 fen, Blue Double Fish at 7 taels and 6 qian, and Squirrel at 7 taels and 1 qian and 5 fen. Coarse cloth sales are not sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Eastern and Western Textiles <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>There is a renewed momentum in actual sales. Customer firms are deeply concerned about a potential boycott, so they are eagerly purchasing eastern goods. Among them, Zhigong cloth is selling well. Tianjin firms purchased over 500 pieces of Sijunzi cloth. Hunting Goose and Sichuan firms are actively searching the market. Many Moganshan and Sanyoutu cloths were purchased by firms along the Yangtze River. The price rose by 0.025. Morris cloth has a large local volume, with Sanmatou priced at 2 taels, 8 qian, and 7.5 fen, and Sanggong priced at 2 taels, 7 qian, and 7.5 fen. However, Yuanyu silk is difficult to rise because the previously ordered goods are continuously arriving in Shanghai. Qingguan Mirror is priced at 12 taels and 1 qian, Bamboo Forest at 12 taels, and Santan at 11 taels, 9 qian, and 5 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American silk sales remained stagnant. Silk prices declined. English and French silk sales were also sluggish. Yokohama silk prices fell sharply. Silk telegrams were not updated. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson only shipped five packages of Shanghai white factory silk, and Dachang shipped 15 packages of white dried silk. Prices remain flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Wuxi Summer Cocoon Production Nearly Exhausted <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Total Volume in the Entire County is Less Than 5,000 Dan</p>
<p>The summer cocoon production in Wuxi this year was initially smooth. The silkworms developed smoothly after hatching. However, during the critical period of the great sleep, continuous rain, combined with sultry heat and extreme cold, caused various silkworm diseases. Yellow diarrhea and black vomit were prevalent, and 80 to 90 percent were discarded. After the worms were put on the frames, they encountered severe thunderstorms, causing most of the silkworm moths to stop spinning silk. Many also died halfway. Cocoon production is nearly exhausted. The total volume for the entire county is estimated to be less than 5,000 dan. Only 20 to 30 percent of the cocoon merchants are formally opening scales. They are weighing and purchasing goods upon sight. The highest cocoon price is only 50 yuan. This year, the Wuxi summer cocoon market is nearly nonexistent.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firms' tea market, needle-eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, etc., was actively traded by firms like Xiehe, Longfu, and Tongfu, with brisk transactions. However, selling prices were slightly lower than before. The sale of precious eyebrow pearl tea of medium and low grades was also active, but the upper and middle-grade goods became sluggish. The Gongxi variety saw relatively active market conditions due to demand from Bombay indicated by telegrams to firms like Baitou, Zhuang Fulin, Qianyi, and Ruichang. However, because Russian firms have not yet started operations, it is difficult to stabilize the market.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Association Begins Economic Boycott of Japan <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Finalizing the List of Committee Members</p>
<p>Banning Further Imports of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Soliciting Boycott Proposals</p>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Congress resolved to vigorously implement an economic boycott of Japan, it has aroused sympathy and attention from all quarters. Yesterday, the association issued a warning prohibiting further imports of Japanese goods after the 14th. At the same time, the Municipal Federation of United Associations telegraphed to solicit economic boycott proposals for contribution. The list of committee members for the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Association has now been finalized by the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the first meeting is scheduled to be held on the 17th. All measures will be actively carried out. The following is a record of the information obtained yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e221">List of Committee Members <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee was organized after a resolution by representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai. The list of committee members was also recommended by the Congress. However, for the sake of prudence, it was resolved on the spot to make a list of the recommended candidates and send it to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review and confirmation. Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Party Headquarters convened a temporary executive committee meeting specifically for this matter and resolved: (1) The Municipal Party Headquarters will not participate in this organization in the name of a group; (2) The number of committee members will be changed to 37, including the Accountants Association; (3) The list of confirmed committee members is as follows: (Labor) Hou Dachun, Wang Wenhua, Wang Zhuping, Lu Jingshi, Li Yongxiang, Chen Peide, Tang Junsheng,</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Necessary Understanding and Effort Regarding the Anti-Chinese Incidents in Korea <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>1. Necessary Understanding: (1) The Wanbaoshan Incident was not only not the fuse for the anti-Chinese incidents in Korea, but was in fact a planned, organized, and step-by-step exploitation by Japanese imperialists as an active anti-Chinese movement. (2) The anti-Chinese sentiment of the Koreans was not out of their own volition, but was forced and threatened by Japanese imperialists to serve as a tool to oppress our overseas Chinese. (3) Japanese imperialists' aggression against our country is their consistent traditional policy in diplomacy. (4) Manchuria and Mongolia in the minds of the Japanese have long been the Japanese's Manchuria and Mongolia, not owned by our country.</p>
<p>2. Necessary Efforts: (1) The 400 million people of the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, must unite closely, and contact all oppressed nations and countries that sympathize with our country, and make a heroic and sworn resistance to the barbaric and arrogant Japanese imperialists. (2) Petition the Central Government to promptly organize an investigation committee to investigate the exact number of overseas Chinese killed and injured in this incident, and the total amount of property lost, and then demand compensation from the Japanese government within a time limit. (3) This time, the Japanese incited Korean people to排華 (anti-Chinese acts), lacking sincerity in protecting our overseas Chinese. In order to effectively ensure future safety, we should petition the National Government to send heavy troops to be stationed in Korea to protect us at any time. (4) Awaken the revolutionary consciousness of the Korean people, and together with our people, stand on the united front against imperialism, and fight to the death with Japanese imperialists. (5) The heads of the Japanese military police in Korea and the main culprits who caused the incident should be ordered to be severely punished by the Japanese government. (6) The people of all walks of life in this city should, under the leadership of our party, carry out a warm, lasting, and effective anti-Japanese movement. The economic boycott of Japan must be carried out uniformly in strict and proper steps. (7) Urge the Central Government to resolve this anti-Chinese incident in Korea through revolutionary diplomacy.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Scheduled Meeting <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The conveners have decided that the first meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month (Friday) in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Standing Committee Room. It is also heard that Sun Mingqi, Xu Huimin, Tang Liqing, Li Ruzhang, etc., were also elected as members of the Congress. However, they all stated that their duties were繁劇 (numerous and onerous) and they had no time to spare. On the day after their election, they requested the Municipal Party Headquarters not to confirm them.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Important Warning <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Congress issued an important warning yesterday, stating that in accordance with the resolution of the Congress on the 13th of this month, an economic boycott of Japan will be vigorously implemented from today onwards. If anyone still privately imports Japanese goods after the 14th, once verified, the most severe sanctions will be imposed in accordance with the measures to be discussed in the future. This is a serious warning, and it is hoped that everyone will pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Circular Telegram to Various Industries <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The association also sent a circular telegram to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations in Shanghai yesterday, stating that the recent violent anti-Chinese incidents in various parts of Korea are actually a cunning scheme by the Japanese to organize and plan the invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia. They are using ignorant Korean people to destroy our shops and kill our overseas Chinese. The injured are lying everywhere, and it is unbearable to witness. According to telegrams, the property loss has exceeded ten million, and the number of overseas Chinese dead and injured is close to ten thousand. This is an unprecedented catastrophe for overseas Chinese, and a rare tragedy in the Republic of China. As the said Japanese imperialists, in order to relieve the domestic economic depression, do not hesitate to disregard the disapproval of the world, and disregard justice and humanity. Today, if the Japanese use economic relief as a motive, then we will use economic boycott as a shield. If the compatriots across the country arouse their conscience and rise up together and persevere to the end, the Japanese will eventually bow their heads, soften, and beg for peace. Therefore, the Congress resolved by the entire body to "permanently implement an economic boycott of Japan with a沉毅猛勇 (resolute and courageous) spirit." In particular, we respectfully inform all sectors to stop importing Japanese goods from today onwards. If any speculative奸商 (profiteering merchants) purchase Japanese goods again, they will be abandoning themselves to the people. Once the measures against Japan have been thoroughly discussed and agreed upon, this association will definitely impose severe sanctions. Please pay special attention to avoid being too late for regrets.

<h3 id="e226">Petition for Protection of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The association also sent a telegram petitioning the National Government to send troops to protect overseas Chinese, which reads: "To the National Government: We note that the Japanese used the Wanbaoshan Incident to incite Korean people to violently排華 (anti-Chinese acts), and dispatched military police to expand the riots. Overseas Chinese in Fushan, Seoul, Incheon, Zhennampo, Sinuiju, Kaesong, Wonsan, Sonchon, Kongju, Cheongju, Hwaseong, Gwangju, and other places in Korea have been brutally massacred, with more than ten thousand people killed. They treat our national sovereignty as if it does not exist, and discard world justice like worn-out shoes. Now, overseas Chinese are in great danger under this tyrannical oppression, and more than 90,000 people have not yet escaped. If we want to rely on Japanese police to maintain order, it is no different from negotiating with a tiger for its skin. Therefore, the Congress resolved to petition your government to: (1) strictly order the Northeast provincial governments to order all Japanese troops and police to leave the country within a time limit; (2) send troops to Korea to stop the riots and protect overseas Chinese. We implore you to consider the urgency of the situation and implement it quickly in order to alleviate the倒懸 (inverted hanging) and rescue the overseas Chinese from the deep waters and scorching fire. In haste, we await your orders with urgency." [Signed] The Provisional Presidium of the Shanghai Municipal Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Congress, Tao Baichuan, Wang Yansong, Zheng Chengqing, Wang Wenhua, Li Yongxiang [deleted].</p>
<h3 id="e227">Soliciting Proposals <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Municipal Federation telegraphed yesterday to solicit proposals for economic boycott of Japan, stating: "To all compatriots across the country: Since the Japanese incited Korean people to launch violent anti-Chinese incidents, our overseas Chinese have been displaced and killed, unable to return. The tragic situation cannot be described in words. Tracing the intentions of the暴日 (violent Japanese), on the one hand, they want to alienate the inherent feelings between the Chinese and Korean nations, and use the Korean people as the急先鋒 (vanguard) to actively invade Manchuria and Mongolia. On the other hand, they want to take the opportunity to destroy all the industry and commerce of overseas Chinese in Korea. Their intentions are clear to everyone. Our compatriots, grieving that the national crisis is imminent and lamenting the tragic massacre of overseas Chinese, must act promptly without delay. The Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Congress has resolved to organize a committee to carry out a sustained economic boycott of Japan. Our association will participate in it and cannot shirk its responsibility. Furthermore, in view of the shortcomings of previous economic boycotts of Japan, we should plan carefully and thoroughly before implementation. Therefore, we are issuing this circular telegram to solicit proposals, and we earnestly hope that all enlightened people across the country will share their wisdom and provide guidance. If there are detailed measures and implementation plans, we would be grateful if you would not hesitate to teach us before the 20th of this month and send them to this association at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce inside the Tianhou Palace Bridge堍 (bridge abutment), so that we can collect and discuss them and contribute them to the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee for reference and adoption. To all the business compatriots across the country, the alarming situation should arouse your conscience and automatically resist. As the saying goes, "If a poisonous snake is in hand, a brave man will cut off his arm." Sacrificing one's limited interests is to leave a permanent life for future generations. In haste, we anxiously await your response." [Signed] The Shanghai Special District Municipal Federation [deleted].</p>
<h3 id="e228">Losses in Ramie Cloth <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>The ramie cloth industry leader, Liu Huanru, told a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday: "Among the regions in our country that produce ramie cloth, Jiangxi and Sichuan have the most, followed by Hunan, Chaozhou, and Suzhou. The total annual value is approximately 20 million yuan. Its largest market is Korea. Although it is subject to unreasonable oppression by the Korean customs, in recent years, the exports from Shanghai alone amount to approximately 4 million yuan for Jiangxi goods, 1 million yuan in total for Hunan and Sichuan goods, and 500,000 yuan in total for Chaozhou and Suzhou goods, totaling more than 5.5 million yuan. The peak sales period is June and July. Since the anti-Chinese riots occurred in Korea, we received telegrams just four days later to stop processing goods. In addition to direct and indirect losses, the intangible losses suffered by the seven major ramie cloth companies in the city, Hengshengdong, Deyu, Longhe, Tonghe Yong, Hejusheng, Yuantai, and Liuluji, etc., have already reached 300,000 yuan. The stock is piled up like mountains and has no market price. If this continues to be delayed, the losses will be even greater."</p>
<h3 id="e229">Request for Allocation of Funds <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Various organizations in this city, during the anti-Japanese aid-to-overseas-Chinese rally held a few days ago, someone proposed that all the national salvation funds collected during the anti-Japanese association era should be remitted to Korea to aid the affected overseas Chinese compatriots. Upon hearing this, the organizations expressed deep sympathy. It is reported that the various organizations will jointly petition the central government and the city's party headquarters within days to immediately execute the remittance of all national salvation funds to Korea via telegraph to aid the overseas Chinese compatriots.</p>
<h3 id="e230">After Korean Riot, it Conversely Promotes the Unity of Small and Weak Ethnic Groups <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>A Letter of Support from Koreans, Vietnamese, and Indians in Shanghai</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: The people of the Korean, Annamese, and Indian parties in Shanghai yesterday issued a declaration of sympathy for the disaster suffered by our country's overseas Chinese in Korea. The original text is as follows: "Chinese compatriots, please be aware. At a time when the small and weak ethnic groups of Asia are striving to unite, there has suddenly been a large-scale massacre of overseas Chinese by Koreans. This unfortunate incident is truly unprecedented and shocking to the world. Even if the Koreans are foolish, they would never kill the overseas Chinese compatriots in the revolutionary base of China to cut off their own path to survival. Even if the instigators of this riot under oppression have a hundred mouths, how can they excuse themselves? The only savior that we small and weak ethnic groups rely on when under accumulated power is China. The imperialists, fearing the realization of this unity, used vicious and cruel means to cause this incident. It can both fulfill their ambitions to invade Manchuria and Mongolia, and also destroy the unity of small and weak ethnic groups. The malice of their intentions is evident here. If the Chinese authorities do not immediately resolve it seriously, then France can instigate the Vietnamese, and England can forcibly oppress the Indians to engage in such mutual slaughter. We, holding the spirit of the Prime Minister's revolution, are seeking the unity of the world's small and weak ethnic groups. In addition to telegraphing our respective nationals, we are specifically exposing their conspiracy, hoping for a common hatred of the enemy. It is of utmost urgency." Park Guoren of the Korean Independence Party, Lu Zhongxun of the Annam Nationalist Party, and Xin Tong of the Indian League.</p>
<p>The National News Agency received a special telegram from Honolulu from Dr. Yang Yuchang and Mr. Li Wensong (both transliterated names) on behalf of the Korean overseas Chinese there, as follows: "The Korean overseas Chinese here held a conference today and resolved to propagate the following: We Koreans have absolutely no hatred towards the Chinese people. Such slanderous remarks are entirely the propaganda of the Japanese, in order to cover up their ulterior motives. Japan is intent on increasing its troops in Korea and Manchuria, driving out the Chinese in Korea, and alienating the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. We Koreans are well aware of the malicious intent of Japanese propaganda, so we specifically request that Chinese comrades widely disseminate this telegram. In the future, we will continue to work together to resist this common enemy."</p>

Bright, bright Hu Gong, an outstanding talent of the era, with the tolerance of the sea and the earth, and the stability of a mountain and abyss. Giving up embroidery, he did not engage in rhetoric. Studying in Baoyang, he researched military classics. Learning for practical application, he joined the army. Exhausting his energy and showing his talent like a leopard, he was compared to a soaring dragon. Oh, magnificent Sun Gong, rising in the south, following with a crossbow, wandering ten thousand miles, falling and rising repeatedly, unyielding in a hundred setbacks. For fifteen years, the campaign was launched. He first pacified the Jiangxi border and then stabilized Fujian. His spirit was as strong as mountains and rivers, his formation was like monkeys and birds. In years of battles, he did not take off his battle clothes. North and South of the Yangtze River, East and West of the Huai River, with the major enemies eliminated, stationed in Wumen. Unfazed by seven offerings, and the bandits were awed. Praised for his merits and rewards, he was recommended as a division commander. Aides and soldiers were all cheering. The stupid red bandits, wantonly wreaked havoc in the south of the Yangtze River, Heaven’s punishment has been delayed for long, and both gods and men are angry. Ordered to suppress bandits, he was brave and went to the front. Ten attacks, ten decisive battles, the stubborn enemies collapsed. Pacifying the good and eliminating the evil, he fought in Guangchang, vowing to wipe out the ugly kind. Stabilizing the homeland, the evil aura was pressing, and a general fell. Alas, a great hero, died halfway with regret. The bow and sword sadly wailed, the heavens and earth sank into gloom. The three armies shed blood, and the seven elite were heartbroken. His meritorious service in defending was high, the ceremony of honoring the dead was important. The Taichang inscribed his merits, praying for a tomb at Qilian. Alas, Hu Gong, born in glory and dying in sorrow, his fragrance remains in the history books. Rest in peace in the underworld. Shihui is not talented, and shared the same boat in adversity. Recalling his heroism, tears flow horizontally. The white sun is bleak, the blue sky is vast. May his spirit come and enjoy these three cups. Farewell.'</p>
<h3 id="e235">Hu's Deeds <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The Garrison Department's Staff Officer Zhong then reported on Hu Zuyu's deeds and achievements, saying: "Hu Gong came from a very poor family. At a young age, he entered the Jiangxi Military Primary School to study. He studied diligently, and his conduct was the best in the whole school. Soon, he encountered the Xinhai Revolution. He followed the former Governor Ma Gong in the Jiujiang Campaign. After things were settled, he returned to school. After graduation, he entered the Hubei Preparatory School and the Baoding Military Academy. After completing his studies, he was assigned to the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Upper Yangtze River as a trainee and company commander. Because his principles differed from those in power, he was depressed and resigned, going to Guangdong and serving under the former Commander of the 14th Army, Commander Lai, serving as company and battalion commander. He fought in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi, and was known for his bravery. The former 14th Army Commander Lai's troops were reorganized into the Fourth Division of the Jiangxi Army. He secretly contacted the revolutionary army, and Hu Gong and the late First Division Commander Yi Gong really approved of his plan. In the Northern Expedition of the 15th year, he made great contributions in the battles of Jishui and Fuzhou, and was promoted to regimental commander. Afterwards, he entered Zhejiang from Fujian, reaching Yixing. In the battle of Zhangzhu, he defeated Bai Baoshan's 30,000 troops. He then captured Changzhou, cutting off the Shanghai-Nanjing transportation, and his merits were especially great. In the Northern Expedition of the 16th year, he participated in the battles of Jiangyin and Jingjiang, and the battle of Linyi, Shandong. He led his troops to bravely climb the city. Later, due to the loss of the main force in Xuzhou, the entire army retreated. Hu Gong led a regiment to cover the rear, and the enemy dared not pursue. In the Second Northern Expedition of the 17th year, he served as deputy division commander, leading his troops across the river. In the battle of Jining Jiajiazhuang, his arrangements were meticulous, and the Japanese army did not dare to invade. After things were settled, he returned to Suzhou and Shanghai to appease the local area, and his efforts were especially appreciated. In the 18th year, Bao Gang and Shi Yousan successively rebelled. He led his troops to pursue and attack, and the enemies were completely routed. Returning to Suzhou, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief for Suppressing Bandits in Taihu Lake. After months of hard work, the bandits in the lake were eliminated. In the 19th year, Yan Feng's disturbances occurred, and he led his division to suppress the rebellion. In the Guide and Minquan areas, he fought fiercely with the enemy, greatly appreciated by the commander-in-chief. After the war ended, he was promoted to division commander, entered Jiangxi to suppress the Reds, and eliminated the bandits in northeastern Jiangxi. The local people praised him endlessly. When pursuing and suppressing the bandits in Nanfeng and Guangchang, he went deep with his isolated army and won victories repeatedly. But because he personally directed from a high ground, he was shot and died. From then on, the loyal and brave Division Commander Hu was permanently separated from us, which was the greatest loss for the Party and the country. (There is also a letter from the Special Party Department of the Fifth Division to all circles, the words of which are omitted.)"</p>
<h3 id="e236">Summary of the Speech <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Then, the Deputy Brigade Commander Zhou of the 26th Regiment gave a speech, saying: "The deeds of Hu Gong have already been reported. I have many feelings at the memorial service, and I am especially grieved. I have been with him for more than ten years, sharing life and death, and I feel that Hu Gong's knowledge and conduct are sufficient to be a model for soldiers. His failure to suppress the bandits is a major loss for the Party and the country. We can only lead the brave soldiers to personally exterminate the bandits in order to avenge him and comfort Hu Gong in the underworld," etc.</p>
<p>The meeting began to adjourn around 11 o'clock. From 2 o'clock in the afternoon, representatives from all walks of life arrived and offered sacrifices, and cars clogged the roads, which were extremely crowded.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Foreign Ship Pilots in Shanghai Demand Increased Fees <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>But the consular body and others do not agree with the request</p>
<p>The situation of confrontation between the two sides is serious</p>
<p>When foreign merchant ships arrive in Shanghai, they must be guided into the port by pilots after arriving at Wusong. Because foreign ship owners are not familiar with the situation of the Bund in the Huangpu River, they must rely on the guidance of pilots. However, the right to pilot ships in Shanghai has been controlled by foreigners for decades. The pilots have an association, located at No. 26 on the Bund. All the more than twenty pilots are Westerners. It is reported that there is only one Chinese pilot. The pilotage fee is very high. Generally, for a ship of more than 5,000 tons, the pilotage fee for entering and leaving Shanghai once is about 600 taels. For example, the Changxing Empress ship needs to pay more than 1,000 taels for pilotage fees for entering and leaving the port once. Now, the pilots, due to the rising gold prices and the high cost of living, specifically convened a general meeting on the 14th, demanding that the shipping companies increase the pilotage fees. When reporters heard the news, they immediately inquired with the association, but they strictly kept it secret. Yesterday, they specifically went to various parties to inquire and learned about the general situation as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e238">Request to Increase Fees <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The Foreign Ship Pilot Association, on the evening of October 4th</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>At 3:00 PM, convened all pilots to discuss the issue of increasing pilotage fees. The reason is that the price of gold is soaring and the cost of living is increasing. Compared with other countries in the world, China's pilotage fee is the shortest. They requested that the shipping companies appropriately increase the currently set fee by 20 percent. For example, from 500 taels per time, increase to 600 taels. The association submitted the request to the shipping companies.</p>
<h3 id="e239">The Shipping Companies Disagree <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The collection of pilotage fees cannot directly collect money from the shipping bureaus according to the established practice. The association must issue a receipt, and then send it to the Shanghai Consular Body, the British Chamber of Commerce, and the Jianghai Customs, etc., for joint signature before the shipping companies can collect the money. This has been the procedure in the past. Now that the pilots are asking for an increase in fees, they must also follow this method and first pass the consular body, the British Chamber of Commerce, etc., before it can be effective. Yesterday, it was heard that the consular body and the British Chamber of Commerce expressed their disagreement with this fee increase proposal, so the shipping companies unanimously rejected it.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Temporary Work Stoppage <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 3:00 PM on the 14th, the pilots stopped working in order to attend the meeting. The ships from Europe, America, and Japan arriving in Shanghai were not guided into the port after arriving at Wusong, so eight foreign ships were blocked. Until yesterday morning, the pilots, in accordance with the association's order, resumed work as usual, stating that the conditions had been put forward. The British ships blocked in Wusong, such as the Xuefubo Mai, Ping Erda, and the German ship Yadu, etc., were guided into the port by the pilots at noon and were already unloading cargo as usual. The outgoing ships also departed yesterday. They were blocked for more than ten hours.</p>
<h3 id="e241">What Was Heard from the Discussion <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the reporter specifically went to the association to inquire about everything, but the association strictly kept the matter secret, saying that the Westerners in the meeting knew about it and it was not convenient to inform. Thus, the reporter did not get the main points. The reporter went to the shipping bureaus to inquire about everything. The shipping companies were not very clear about the attitude of the Pilot Association. However, according to what was heard, if there is no satisfactory reply today, the pilots will take the most serious and decisive measures. It is feared that this will cause ships to be blocked from entering and leaving the Huangpu River at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e242">The Shipping Companies' Attitude <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>The reporter also inquired about the claims of the shipping companies from all sides. In general, they cannot hastily agree to the fee increase, because it must be agreed by the three organizations. If the pilots take decisive measures, the shipping companies have also discussed a kind of remedial plan. Before the matter is realized, it cannot be revealed. However, the method is to maintain the ships and not stop them as the main thing.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Chinese Ships Are Not Affected <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Chinese merchant ships have always hired their own pilots. Whether it is a ship on the Yangtze River or in the South or North Seas, each ship has a pilot assigned. Therefore, the current turmoil in foreign pilotage, even if a strike is realized, will not hinder Chinese ships at all.</p>
<p>Dawan Daily reports that regarding the revision of the pilotage fee, the Inspector General of Customs summoned the River Affairs Department and the Patrol Engineering Department this morning (15th) for an important discussion. It ended at noon, and the contents could not be ascertained. It is reported that the Pilot Association requested that the pilotage fee be changed to gold coins for calculation and paid in silver taels. One Shanghai standard silver tael is at least equivalent to one shilling and eight pence, and at most equivalent to two shillings and three pence. According to the new price, it is about 20 percent higher than the current price. It is also heard that the current licensed pilots earn about 1,300 taels per month. After deducting various expenses, they can actually get 900 taels. As for the attitude of the shipping companies, because their current business is depressed, they all believe that it is not yet time to increase fees.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Xinming Ship Raises Fire and Waits for Departure <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Waiting for a telegram back from Yantai, Korea</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinming ship, upon receiving a telegram order from the Ministry of Communications, was sent to Korea to transport the distressed overseas Chinese back to the country. The bureau has prepared food and materials and is waiting for a reply telegram from Yantai, Korea, before opening. It was originally planned to export it yesterday afternoon. General Manager Guo of the bureau believed that since the Xinming was going to Korea, the bureau had no pier, and matters such as importing, stopping, checking ship money, etc., must be negotiated in advance to avoid accidents. Therefore, the night before, he specifically telegraphed the Consul General in Seoul, Zhang Weicheng, asking him to handle it on his behalf, and inquired whether the ship needed to go to Korea, and stated that he would wait for a reply telegram to Shanghai before opening. At the same time, he sent a third telegram to the Yantai Chamber of Commerce, asking again if the previous two telegrams had been received and why there was no reply. He asked whether the Xinming's return to Korea to rescue overseas Chinese compatriots would return to Yantai or other ports, and asked them to telegraph quickly so that Xinming could be informed. However, after the two telegrams were sent, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company waited for telegrams from the two places. Until yesterday afternoon, no reply telegrams had been received, so the Xinming ship had not yet departed. However, the bureau still ordered the Xinming to stop at the Jinliyuan pier, waiting for the reply telegrams from Korea and Yantai to arrive, before sailing. If the telegram arrives at night, the ship can depart this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e245">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Issues Back Pay to Ship Crew and Sailors <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Pay in full monthly from now on</p>
<p>The salaries of the stewards, stokers, and sailors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships were in arrears during the time of the former General Manager Zhao Tieqiao. When Li Zhonggong took office and the current commissioner Guo Waifeng succeeded him, the stewards, stokers, and sailors on each ship had been in arrears for three or four months, causing great difficulties in the lives of the crew and sailors. Since Commissioner Guo took office, he has been deeply concerned about the hardships of the employees on the ships and the importance of their work at sea. Therefore, on May 12, he first paid two or three months of the back pay. Then, the back pay for April, May, and June was paid in full the day before yesterday. From now on, they will be paid monthly without further delay. The three types of employees on each ship were very grateful for this. They specifically elected Chairman Che Defang of the Junan Association as their representative to express the sincerity of all the stewards, stokers, and sailors to Commissioner Guo. Guo was very pleased with Che's enthusiasm for the bureau's affairs, which he had been doing for decades as if it were one day, and said that the salaries of the crew and stokers would be paid on time every month from now on, and there would be no further delays. This time, in the midst of economic difficulties, priority was given to raising the arrears of the crew, so that the lives of the sailors would not be affected and they could work with peace of mind.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Zhang Weihan and Others Were Summoned to Shanghai to Go to Jiangxi <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Weihan, member of the Yunnan Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, was summoned by Chairman Jiang of the National Government via telegram. He and Sun Du, Chief of Staff of the 10th Route Army Headquarters and member of the Provincial Committee, came to Shanghai from Yunnan a few days ago. After arriving in port the day before yesterday, he and Committee Member Sun boarded the Japanese ship Xiangyang Maru yesterday afternoon at 10:00 PM to leave Shanghai for Nanchang, to meet with Chairman Jiang to ask for important matters, and to report on the recent military and political situation in Yunnan Province.</p>
<h3 id="e247">The Northeast Inspection Group of the School of Commerce of the National Central University Departed Yesterday <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The round trip will take about two months</p>
<p>The inspection matters are mainly economic</p>
<p>Professor Wu Yugan of the School of Commerce of the National Central University, and this year's graduates She Fangyao, Li Zongwen, Song Xunlun, Cao Baorang, and Shen Guangpei, in view of the increasing seriousness of the Northeast issue and the need for on-site inspection, specifically organized a Northeast Inspection Group to personally brave the heat and trek long distances, intending to devote all of the summer vacation to on-site inspections. After several months of preparations, Wu, the group's instructor, led all the members on a quick car at night yesterday, departing from Shanghai. They will pass through more than twenty famous capitals, including Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Shenyang, Jilin, Changchun, Harbin, Longjiang, Taonan, Siping Street, Dalian, Yantai, and Qingdao. Photo of the Northeast Inspection Group departing for inspection (gifted by Mr. Cao Xun Chang)</p>
<p>It takes about two months to make a round trip. In addition to the economic aspect, which is especially important, the inspection matters will also pay attention to other things, such as international political relations and social conditions. According to the group, this trip has been sponsored and instructed by Mr. Chen Binhe, Zhu Xinong, and Du Chongyuan, for which they are especially grateful.</p>

<p>Personnel will be sent to foreign ships at the port to inspect.</p>
<p>The Shipping Association requests exemption for passengers on Shanghai-Ningbo ships.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Health, because it is the summer season when infectious diseases are prone to occur, the city's prevention and control should be intensified. In addition to paying special attention to public food and street cleaning, epidemic prevention stations are also set up everywhere to prepare for emergencies. Recently, the bureau has also received news from places such as India that cases of cholera and meningitis have been found. It is deeply feared that travelers will spread the diseases inland. In order to ensure thorough prevention, the bureau plans to send personnel to inspect foreign ships before landing. If there are indeed serious cases of the disease, they will either be sent to the hospital for treatment or prevented from landing. If the cases are lighter, personnel sent by the Bureau of Health will provide appropriate treatment to prevent the spread and eliminate the occurrence. According to Zhong Zhiqi, section chief of the Bureau of Health, the entire inspection plan is currently being studied and planned.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association sent a letter to the National Seaport Quarantine Office yesterday, saying, "Respectfully, the members of the shipping companies China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanbei Shipping Company, and Ning Shao Shipping Company sent letters saying that they received a letter from the National Seaport Inspection Office approving a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health requesting cooperation in dispatching officials to inspect passengers coming from Ningbo to Shanghai by ship, and to forcibly inject cholera prevention needles to passengers in steerage. They were instructed to report vessels coming from Ningbo 24 hours before entry so that personnel can be dispatched for inspection. It is noted that the water route between Shanghai and Ningbo is close, and the ship schedule is frequent, departing in the evening and arriving in the morning, arriving early and departing late. When there are the most passengers, including the crew, the number is more than 3,000. If cholera prevention needles are to be injected by name and stools are collected, it is impossible to complete during the journey from Song to Shanghai (the ship travels from Song to Shanghai in less than an hour). If the ship has arrived in Shanghai Port, but the inspection procedures have not yet been completed and passengers are prohibited from landing, then the large number of people will be difficult to contain. If enforcement is strengthened, it will cause trouble. Therefore, the result is sufficient to hinder transportation and affect business. It is difficult in fact and has a major relationship. In any case, it is difficult to comply with. We should request the association to forward the letter to cancel the practice of inspecting passenger stools and forcibly injecting cholera prevention needles on ships from Ningbo, in order to facilitate transportation and maintain the shipping industry. We are sincerely committed to public relations." Another letter to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health, the text of which is omitted.</p>

<p>All Vessels Infected with Plague</p>
<p>Must Undergo Fumigation</p>
<p>The Wu Song Pao Taiwan Public Quarantine Hospital, along with Western-trained doctors Hu Junhe from Hubei and Chen from Shantou, recognizing the prevalence of plague in ports like Hong Kong, have taken measures to safeguard Shanghai by inspecting cargo sailing vessels susceptible to the disease. Special attention is being given to live pig boats arriving in Shanghai from various Jiangbei ports. Therefore, all pig boats entering the port must anchor off the Pao Taiwan shore for inspection. When the doctors board for inspection, if giant rats are found in the cargo hold, quarantine procedures must be followed, including spraying the holds with disinfectant and fumigating them with sulfur smoke, saltpeter, and various medicinal powders. Only after completing the fumigation are the vessels allowed to proceed to Shanghai. The fumigation fee is ten taels of silver per vessel, to be paid by the shipowners.</p>

<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society recently received another telegram from the Biyuan Branch in Henan, appealing for disaster relief. It stated that people are without clothing, food, or shelter, and their cries for help go unheard. Several come to the branch for assistance every day, their starving and dying state truly unbearable to hear and see. These victims are like fish stranded in a dry rut, needing water from the West River to be saved. Due to the branch's lack of funds, even with the utmost charity and enthusiasm, it is powerless to address the situation. Currently, the branch is providing clothing, food, medicine, burials, and infant care, relying on donations from the slightly more affluent members to maintain the status quo. However, a drizzle cannot revive withered seedlings, and a single tree cannot support a large building. Furthermore, the increase in bandit activity threatens to leave no survivors in Tang County, making the situation even more unbearable. The Red Cross Society is actively preparing for disaster relief, and once funds are available, they will be submitted to the Standing Committee for review.</p>

<p>Police Recover Another Car</p>
<p>Shuai Rode in This Car After Kidnapping Lu</p>
<p>Defendant Still Firmly Denies Involvement</p>
<p>Shuai Songping, aka "Shuai the Bearded," a former high-ranking official turned kidnapper, was apprehended by the police for kidnapping Lu Shaotang, a comprador at the Banque de l'Indochine, and demanding ransom. He was handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jia-shi of the Criminal Court conducted a further hearing. Shuai Songping continued to retain lawyer E Sen for his defense. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated that after the incident, the police seized several cars, motorcycles, and bicycles, which have been confiscated by the court. Now, the police have discovered another car, license number 11727, being repaired at a garage at 867 Mei Bai Ke Road. Investigation revealed that Shuai had parked this car near the scene before the kidnapping, and after Lu was abducted, Shuai used this car to escape. The police have now recovered the vehicle. Chief Detective Hunter then reported on the investigation. When questioned, Shuai Songping firmly denied involvement. Judge Xu then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for a future hearing.</p>

<p>Lawyer Ren Zhennan was accused by his wife in the District Court of indecent behavior. After investigation by the prosecutor, he was not prosecuted. The details are of interest to those concerned with social and legal issues, and the full text is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Defendant <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Ren Zhennan, male, 23 years old, from Guangdong, lawyer, residing at 16 Beile Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Facts <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Xingjuan, i.e., Ren Jiang's, accused the defendant of acting perversely and inhumanely, causing serious injury to her anus, and requested investigation and punishment. The plaintiff stated that she is 21 years old and was betrothed to the defendant as a child bride at the age of 13. They were formally married on May 10 of this year. The defendant, after frequenting brothels and contracting a venereal disease, passed bloody urine. On the third day of their marriage, he attempted anal sex, attempting it over ten times. He often could not penetrate, causing unbearable pain. When he could not penetrate, he often beat her, causing pain in her private area. Two weeks prior, he managed to penetrate her anus twice, causing injury and bleeding. An examination showed no injuries to her head, face, chest, abdomen, or genitalia, only a minor bluish-red bruise on her left leg caused by a kick.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Reasoning <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>According to legal principles, the definition of crime and punishment is governed by law. Any act punishable by law is a crime and cannot be analogized or inferred. Therefore, Article 1 of China's Criminal Law states that there can be no crime without a specific law. In this case, the victim and the defendant were formally married on May 10, and according to Article 1001 of the Civil Code, they have an obligation to cohabit. Therefore, the crimes of indecent behavior in Article 241, forced act in Article 318, and rape in Article 240 of the Criminal Law are not applicable. Although Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the Civil Code does not provide specific rules on how to fulfill the obligation to cohabit, if intercourse between husband and wife causes significant harm, it cannot be considered a crime. Similarly, there is no explicit law prohibiting anal intercourse. Indecency towards women should be punished by education and morality, not by criminal law. Regarding the injury to the left leg, the element of injury in criminal law requires damage to the physiological function of the human body. In other words, it must impair the function of the body. Domestic quarrels and violence are common. Although the kick caused a minor bluish-red bruise, it did not reach the level of impairing function. Even if the allegations are true, it is only a violation of police regulations and not punishable under Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Moreover, harmony is valued in the family. Even if there are disputes, seeking resolution through the Civil Code is more practical. For minor injuries, it is inappropriate to impose criminal punishment. Therefore, in accordance with Article 244, Paragraph 2 and 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, no prosecution will be initiated. Liu Maochu, Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court, July 14, 1931.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Inheritance Dispute of Pang Qingcheng <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Nephew Sues Uncle for Failure to Fulfill Contract</p>
<p>After the death of Pang Qingcheng, a wealthy man from Nanxun, his family held an estate division, dividing the property into three shares. Two shares went to Qingcheng's sons, Bingquan and Qingchen, and one share went to Qingcheng's brother, Laichen. Each share was worth about 190,000 yuan. In addition, real estate worth 50,000 yuan was designated for ancestral worship. The remaining public hall property worth over 200,000 yuan was managed by Pang Laichen. It was also divided into three shares, and it was decided that within eight weeks after January 9, 1929, accountants would be appointed to work with Pang Tiansheng and other managers to liquidate the assets. A contract was drawn up, but for over two years, Pang Laichen has failed to fulfill the contract. Pang Bingquan then hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to sue Pang Laichen in the Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering him to fulfill the contract and hand over all public hall property accounts for liquidation. Judge Zhou Daren of the Civil Court Nine summoned the defendant yesterday morning, but he did not appear. Lawyers Zhu Sifu and Cai Nipei appeared on his behalf. Lawyer Zhu stated that the defendant, Pang Laichen, went to Beiping on April 22 and has not returned. Therefore, the lawyers were only entrusted by his family and have not received a power of attorney signed by him. He also stated that there was hope for a settlement and requested a two-week adjournment, which Judge Zhou granted. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Arguments Concluded by Both Sides</p>
<p>Court Orders Sentencing at a Later Date</p>
<p>Jieji Company at 146 Taoyuanfang, Beihainan Road, specializes in freight transportation. On March 23 of this year, Yu Zhenxiang, the company's accountant and manager, brought 362 packages from an unknown location and loaded them onto a truck, intending to send them to Shanxi, Hebei, and other places via the Jiangwan Post Office. While passing Beisichuan Road, the truck was stopped by Chief Inspector Lu Jiankui and detective Zhang Shaoqing of the General Inspectorate. Upon searching, the 362 packages were found to contain narcotics such as red pills, morphine, and heroin. Both the goods and Yu and his accomplice Li Hongru were arrested and handed over to the Special District Court for sentencing. Yu was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined 3,000 yuan, while Li was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan. The narcotics were confiscated. Yu, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Higher Branch Court. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Song Yuan and associate judges Du and Gao held a hearing. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin represented the police, while lawyers Zheng Wenkai, Xue Jiaqi, and Wang Zuxun represented Yu. Judge Song first questioned the witness Li Hongru briefly and then ordered arguments. Lawyer Zheng and others stated that the initial sentence was entirely based on Li Hongru's testimony. However, after careful review of Li's testimony, inconsistencies were found, and today's testimony differed from the initial testimony, making it unreliable. They requested that Yu be declared innocent. They also stated that Yu was ill in prison and requested that he be released on bail. Police lawyer Zhang stated that if the appellant requested a reduced sentence, the police might agree, but a request for acquittal was inappropriate both in law and in equity. He requested a ruling. Judge Song then declared the arguments concluded and scheduled sentencing for a later date.</p>

<p>The renovation of the entire Xin Zha Road thoroughfare west of the North Ni Cheng Bridge, including the installation of double tram tracks, has been a large and time-consuming project. During the construction period, only trams were allowed to pass, and other vehicles had to detour via Shanhai Guan Road or Avenue Road. This spring, the road was open to Mei Bai Ke Road, and the section from Mei Bai Ke Road to Da Tong Road was rebuilt over three months, and the construction work was finished the week before last week. Now, the entire road is completed, and vehicles can pass as usual. The road surface is particularly wide, allowing for smooth traffic flow. The reconstruction of the asphalt and concrete road west of Carde Road has also been done simultaneously, and it is near to completion.</p>

<h3 id="e265">Explanation of the Weights and Measures Inspection Office's Implementation of the New System <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Weights and Measures Inspection Office, in response to a submission from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce based on resolutions from its members' representative assembly, requesting the adoption of four measures for implementing the new weights and measures system, submitted a response to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau clarifying misunderstandings. The Social Affairs Bureau then approved the response and forwarded it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Received and forwarded to the Municipal Weights and Measures Inspection Office for review. The response states: "After reviewing the points raised by the members' representatives, there appears to be a misunderstanding of the meaning and implementation of the new system. The weights and measures within the city are being standardized simultaneously, not sequentially. The inspection schedule is merely the order of operations, not a sequential order of standardization. This is the first point. Periodic inspections of weights and measures are conducted annually according to regulations. Shanghai, as a commercial and industrial city, will begin implementation in 1931, as delaying further would prevent universal inspection within a year. While it is true that delaying inspections would allow merchants to prepare adequately, the office estimates that the production capacity of weights and measures manufacturers in the city is sufficient to meet the needs of merchants and residents at any time, preventing shortages. Furthermore, the office's inspections are conducted by district and period. For example, the Hubei district is designated as the first period, the Zhabei district as the second period, and the Special District as the third period. The first period is scheduled from July 11 to September 16. Therefore, during the inspection of Hubei, Zhabei can prepare, and during the inspection of Zhabei, the Special District can prepare. The long duration between these periods allows for sufficient preparation. Even within the first district, Hubei, the police precincts of the Public Safety Bureau are divided into seven zones, allowing merchants to prioritize preparation based on the order of inspections. This is the second point. Regarding penalties during inspections, the office does not plan to strictly enforce them this year, and is under strict orders to comply. Therefore, the implementation period is essentially a promotional period. However, explicitly defining the promotional period may conflict with regulations. This is the third point. The chamber requested that representatives from trade associations participate in inspections. The department's inspection regulations do not include such a provision, and it appears that no exceptions should be made. Furthermore, the stated goal of preventing harassment is based on a misunderstanding. Inspection officers have the legal authority to conduct inspections with the assistance of police officers. If an officer is truly intent on harassment, trade association representatives would be unable to stop them. Moreover, under national law, the officer would be subject to criminal penalties. Article 11 of the department's inspection regulations clearly outlines the penalties for violations by inspection officers. This is the fourth point. The office only destroys weights and measures that are beyond repair. Items that can be repaired are not included. Regarding the request to allow merchants to temporarily use old weights and measures before purchasing new ones, the office believes that merchants should submit a guarantee to the office and its subordinate public security agencies, promising to purchase new weights and measures within a certain number of days and send the old weights and measures to the office to be stamped as invalid. This would be a more equitable and legal solution." Therefore, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau approved this reply for the information of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. This concludes the order.</p>

<p>Radio expert Cao Zhongyuan recently returned to China after studying electrical engineering in Germany. Yesterday, several organizations, including the Commercial Press, the Chinese Students' Alliance of the World, and the China Evening News, held a banquet at Gongdelin to welcome him. In addition to Mr. Cao, Huang Wan, Shen Zhuowu, Huang Jingwan, Liu Daben, Gu Yinming, Chen Dingmo, Zhu Shaoping, Yao Chuying, Zhu Meizi, and over 30 others attended. Shen Zhuowu delivered a welcome speech, and Gu Yinming introduced Mr. Cao's past efforts in the radio industry and his diligent studies in Germany. He hoped that Mr. Cao would continue to focus on electrical research and innovation and not enter politics. Mr. Cao gave a brief report, expressing his admiration for the spirit of scientific research and the creative ability of the German people. He stated, "German scientists over the age of seventy are still immersed in their work, diligent and tireless. However, upon returning to China, I found that some of my old friends in the engineering field, only in their forties, have already retired. After a few years in government service, they have accumulated vast wealth. This situation is truly disheartening for the future of science in our country..."

<h3 id="e270">Feng Zhushi Requests Overseas Cantonese to Raise Funds for Guangdong Flood Relief <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>All Shores of the Three Rivers Have Become Marshland</p>
<p>Flood Victims are Everywhere, No Relief is Heard Of</p>
<p>The Guomin She (National Citizen Society) reports that the eastern, western, and northern rivers of Guangdong Province have simultaneously experienced torrential floods. All areas along the shores have turned into marshlands. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in the last decade or so, yet there has been no word of overseas Cantonese raising funds for relief. Currently, Feng Zhushi, a Cantonese residing in Shanghai, has specially written to the Guangzhao Public Association, Chaozhou Guild Hall, and other organizations, requesting them to quickly organize relief efforts. The original letter is transcribed below.</p>
<p>Respectfully stated: Yesterday, reading the newspaper, it was reported that continuous rainfall in Guangdong Province in recent months has caused torrential floods in the eastern, western, and northern rivers simultaneously, resulting in a major flood disaster, unheard of in the last ten-odd years. This is the second flood disaster in the Dongjiang (East River) this time. It is found that in Huiyang, Boluo, Heyuan, and other counties, the water depth has increased from over two feet to over twenty feet. In slightly lower-lying areas, it has reached a staggering fifty to sixty feet, a vast expanse of water where no grass is seen. The lower reaches of the Dongjiang, with the lowest terrain, have more than ten water lanes along the city, which are already several feet deep. The water level of the Chao, Mei, and Han rivers has also risen by more than six feet. The Xijiang (West River) has also been rising steadily in recent days, with the western floods also rising sharply. Many areas along the Xijiang have been flooded. Currently, from Zhaoqing Gorge to the downstream, the water depth is over ten feet. Shijiao Enclosure is on the verge of collapse, fortunately, nearby residents are making great efforts to rescue it, thus avoiding the disaster. However, the upstream water is turbulent and swift as an arrow, with surging waves. From Shijiao Enclosure to Lubao, the water and sky are the same color, boundless and indistinct. Many of the embankments along the way have been flooded, and countless houses have been washed away. Observing the current water situation, it continues to rise. The flooding in Sanshui this year is not far from that of the year of Yimao (i.e., the fourth year of the Republic, 1915). If it continues to rain heavily during the day, the embankments will inevitably collapse beyond salvation. Currently, the Lubao Dapu Enclosure has already been breached by dozens of feet due to unsuccessful rescue efforts. The overwhelming water has buried all the ripening sorghum and early rice, creating an unprecedentedly huge flood disaster in Guangdong Province. The embankments that have not yet collapsed are in imminent danger.</p>
<p>The area along the Beijiang (North River) is particularly severely affected. From Yingde and below, in places like Boluokeng, Lianjiang, Lidong, Hengshi, and Pajiang, the floods have overflowed, turning everything into marshland. The lowest-lying areas are flooded to a depth of over twenty feet, with the shallowest being seven or eight feet or more. Therefore, the houses in the villages have all been submerged to the rooftops, and countless have collapsed as a result. Hundreds of thousands of people in the disaster area have all fled to the nearby mountains, sleeping in the open air and exposed to the wind and rain. Epidemics are spreading, and many have fallen ill and died as a result. Livestock and vegetables are floating on the water surface, which is a heartbreaking sight. Even if the floodwaters recede, the signs of famine have already formed. This time, the disaster area is vast, and the disaster is extremely severe. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who have escaped to the mountains and fields are crying out for food. However, the local authorities here have not heard any plans for relief. Although I, a humble fellow villager, have the heart but not the strength, in a state of panic, I hereby respectfully inform fellow villagers of Guangdong Province everywhere. I earnestly request that you quickly rise up together to organize relief efforts to save hundreds of thousands of fellow villagers from dire straits. Painful words of appeal, I humbly hope for your attention.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Feng Zhushi, a Cantonese residing in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e274">Preferential Treatment for Female Postal Service Examinations <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>The Postal Workers' Union Holds a Skeptical Attitude</p>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Communications has ordered the Postal Administration to give preferential consideration to female candidates in the upcoming recruitment of postal workers. There has been much speculation about this. According to sources from the local Postal Workers' Union, the post office began hiring female employees last year. However, the principle of equal opportunity for men and women was adopted during the examinations, and the same treatment was given to all, regardless of gender, only considering academic qualifications. There has never been any distinction between preferential or inferior treatment. The Ministry of Communications' opinion on giving preferential consideration to women in the recruitment, as reported this time, is not found in the official documents. Whether it is true or not remains to be proven. In short, the method of preferential recruitment clearly violates the meaning of "equality". Our government, which emphasizes harmony and equality, will never make such a special and strange move. In order to maintain the spirit of equality, we very much hope that this move will not be realized. It is also heard that the executive committee of the union decided yesterday to formally ask the ministry to explain the reasons after the news is confirmed.</p>

<p>There are a total of 106 silk factories in Shanghai, including 6 twin-cocoon silk factories and 100 single-cocoon silk factories. There is also one twin-cocoon silk factory in Zhejiang and Hangzhou. This time, the silk factory operators in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have jointly applied to the government for the issuance of 8 million yuan of silk industry public debt, with 4 million yuan for improving silk machinery and 4 million yuan for subsidizing silk factory operations. All issues related to the allocation of debt quotas and the management of funds have been carried out by specialized committees. However, the nature of twin-cocoon silk factories and single-cocoon silk factories are different, and the ministry intends to not allow them to enjoy the rights of public debt equally. The Shanghai Silk Factory Association considers that twin-cocoon silk factories are also members of the association and should not be discriminated against. Chairman Shen has repeatedly argued with reason at the executive committee meeting of the special committee. It has now been resolved that twin-cocoon silk factories will also enjoy the rights of public debt, with the same treatment as single-cocoon silk factories. It has been requested that the Ministry of Finance order the Jianghai Customs to collect special taxes on the export of twin-cocoon silk from now on. The special taxes on the export of twin-cocoon silk before should be made up for according to the amount.</p>

<h3 id="e283">Injury Case Judgment <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>On the evening of June 10th, at around 10:00 PM, Zhu Qiyong, Huang Xiliang, and Zhu Kuiguang, employees of the Jing'an Temple Road National Product Commercial Field, were beaten by Dong Junchu, a Chinese police officer from the Lao Zha (Old Gate) Police Station No. 2966, and Kuolaike, an American police officer No. 325, with batons in front of the commercial field. Jiang Shiyi, Peng Qixiu, and Wang Shizong, three lawyers, filed a complaint with the French Concession Court. However, the court has no jurisdiction over the part of Kuolaike, who is of British nationality. Regarding the part of Dong Junchu's injury, Judge Wu Tingqi once gathered for questioning on June 6th, and instructed Dong to submit a summons to the shop guarantor to wait for rescheduling. It has been stated in this newspaper that if both parties have witnesses, they can submit written reports. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the rescheduling date had arrived. Judge Wu came to the second criminal court and first questioned the defendant Dong Junchu, saying, "During the previous court questioning, the plaintiffs Wang Xiliang and Zhu Kuiguang both pointed out in court that you were the one who hit them. What do you have to say?" Dong replied, "I did not hit them." The plaintiff Huang Xiliang was then questioned. According to his statement, he only recognized the numbers of the Chinese police officer who started the beating as 2966 and the western police officer as 325, but he did not see their faces clearly. Judge Wu asked why he only recognized the defendant's number. He replied that after he was beaten, he ran away, and the defendant did not give up and chased after him, so he recognized him. Asked if there were any other witnesses, he replied yes, there are Zhang Demei, Yu Pei, Zhang Hanchen, and other employees of the accounting department of the National Product Commercial Field, but none of them were present today. According to the plaintiff Zhu Kuiguang's statement, the numbers of the western police officer 325 and the Chinese police officer 2966 were seen during the beating. They first hit Zhu Qiyong, and then hit our heads and waists, and were injured. The waist was hit by the defendant, and the head was injured by the western police officer. According to the translator of the case of the western police officer 325, his name is Kuolaike, and he works at the Lao Zha Police Station. Judge Wu asked him, "At 10:00 PM on June 10th, how many people did the National Product Commercial Field officers arrest? Did you go with them?" The answer was, "I was also present, but only one person was arrested." Asked what his name was, he replied, "His surname is Song, he is not in court today." Asked, "Where was the defendant standing at this time?" The answer was, "On the road between Xizang Road and Nanjing Road, with the western police officer No. 194." Asked, "Did the three plaintiffs get injured, and did you start?" The answer was, "I don't know the situation." At this time, the defendant's agent Ding Rong stood up and requested that the western police chief Kanboer be allowed to report the case, because the western police chief saw the situation at the time and was the one who started. Judge Wu did not grant his request. The lawyer repeatedly requested, but it was not approved. He immediately began to debate. Lawyer Ding said that he would study this point further, or he would file an appeal. The plaintiffs' agents, lawyers Jiang and Peng, stood up successively and debated, asking the defendant to be punished for the crime of injury under Article 293 of the Criminal Law and Article 40 of the Criminal Law. Then, the defendant's agent, Lawyer Ding, continued to debate. Finally, the prosecutor expressed his opinion, saying that the facts of the case were very clear, and he asked for a judgment according to the law. The main text said, "Dong Junchu is sentenced to three months of imprisonment for the crime of harming people on the pretext of performing his duties. Before the judgment is finalized, the number of days of detention shall be deducted from the imprisonment at the rate of two days for one day. The part of Kuolaike will not be accepted. During the appeal period, Dong Junchu shall still be released on the original guarantee."</p>

At about 6:00 AM yesterday morning, she took her own car, the French Concession registration number is 667, and ordered the driver Tang Xiangsheng, (44 years old, Pudong native) to drive to Liuhe Town to offer incense. The second-hand driver Fang Guilin (40 years old, Anhui native) was also on the car. At about 6:30, when the car was no more than seven miles away from the destination, the place was remote and there were few pedestrians. Tang increased the speed and drove quickly. The road, although it was a coal cinder road, had been in disrepair for a long time, and was uneven. Suddenly, with a loud noise, the car fell into the creek on the side of the road, causing injuries to all three. Li's right foot was scraped, Fang Guilin was seriously injured, his right arm was fractured, and the back of his right hand was scraped. Tang Xiangsheng only suffered skin injuries, and his clothes were mostly drenched, like a chicken that fell into the water. Fortunately, the car was not damaged. Later, pedestrians arrived and helped to lift the car. Tang Xiangsheng drove back to Shanghai and sent the injured to the Baolong Hospital for treatment. Tang was diagnosed by a doctor and discharged from the hospital.</p>

<h3 id="e301">A Collapsed Cart <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Deren</p>
<p>It was almost noon, and the blazing sun shone brightly on a long road. The pedestrians on the road were walking hurriedly and diligently. Suddenly, at the turn of the road, a collapsed cart loaded with bricks appeared. Four people were pulling it in the front, and one person was pushing it in the back. However, because this newly constructed asphalt road was not very sturdy, and the hot sun had softened it a bit, the heavily loaded cart left wheel marks on it from time to time. As the people pulling this cart were about to exert themselves to pull it through the turn, the cart suddenly stopped moving.</p>
<p>The coolies pulling the cart seemed to be very strenuous. Heavy sighs were constantly coming from their open mouths, and beads of sweat were hanging straight down their greasy backs. They continued, still trying hard to push forward, but the wheels seemed to be stuck to the ground, not moving at all. The pedestrians on the road, seeing this cart that could not move forward, gave it a faint sidelong glance and hurried on their way.</p>
<p>Before long, a boy who looked like a shop assistant, about ten years old, walked over from afar, holding a bowl in one hand and a dozen copper coins in the other. He was smugly and playfully knocking the copper coins on the edge of the bowl, while humming lazily from his mouth. The discordant sound mixed with the sound of the copper coins hitting the edge of the bowl.</p>
<p>He slowly walked closer, step by step, and finally stopped in front of the collapsed cart, curiously watching the pulling of these tired coolies.</p>
<p>"Let me help you out. Why can't this cart move at all?" The boy put down the bowl and copper coins, and confidently giggled as he helped them push hard at the back of the cart. But he was a child, and a child's strength, no matter how strong, was ultimately limited and could not compare with that of adults. Although he lowered his head and pushed with all his might, the cart still did not move.</p>
<p>At this time, several children around the age of five or six had already gathered around the collapsed cart.</p>
<p>"Everyone come and help, help! The wheels of this cart seem to be stuck in the asphalt!" This child, who was helping the coolies push, seeing that he was ultimately useless, shouted at others to help.</p>
<p>The weather was so sultry, and the sunlight was so strong. Even half-naked, constantly waving a fan, it still didn't seem cool. Who would be happy to exert themselves again to help these coolies who were unrelated to me, and make themselves sweat unnecessarily?</p>
<p>Children are active, so the children who were gathered around the collapsed cart, seeing that no one came to help, reached out their hands and recklessly went to help. However, the coolies, not appreciating the good intentions, rudely stopped them.</p>
<p>"Thank you, would you please help us push?" These helpless coolies pleaded with the shopkeepers sitting idly in the shops along the road, waving their fans, and with the passers-by wearing short shirts and exposing their sweaty chests.</p>
<p>"Who would be happy to waste their energy pushing for you?" I imagined that the shopkeepers who were watching coldly probably thought this way in their hearts, because you could see this expression from their unmoved, always still faces. And, oh, they were so good at calmly and motionlessly passing the time. If their hand waving the fan hadn't been moving, and their eyes hadn't been rolling, I might have thought they were already dead, already cold, already stiff.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with a chattering sound, several rickshaws carrying people came. When the rickshaw pullers saw that the collapsed cart was blocking their way, they shouted loudly. Later, when they realized that their shouts were useless, they frowned and grumbled as they helped the coolies push hard forward.</p>
<p>The strength of several rickshaw pullers was indeed not small. After they pushed hard a few times, the wheels moved slightly at first, and then, with a "whish" sound, the wheels slid over. The faces of the coolies pulling the collapsed cart immediately showed happy smiles, and they nodded slightly to the rickshaw pullers and went away, raising their voices.</p>
<p>At this time, the children who were gathered around the cart all cheered and ran away, jumping and skipping. The child who had helped the coolies push but couldn't move it also gradually walked away, knocking the edge of the bowl along the way, humming casually. And the shopkeepers next to the counter in the shops along the road were still sitting idly, listlessly, coldly watching a pedestrian's sweaty face... Everything was the same as before, only the turn in the road, covered in sunlight, had one more wheel mark.</p>

<h3 id="e303">The World's Shoe King—Bata <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Fulan</p>
<p>When the son of a village cobbler, whose father carried his tools from door to door soliciting business, who would have thought that the son would today make the industrial circles of Britain and America retreat in deference?</p>
<p>He is Thomas Bata, from Zlin in Moravia, Czechoslovakia, who is the current world shoe king.</p>
<p>Regardless of Bata's thoughts, he is influential enough to affect the markets of Northampton and Leicester in Britain, and the shoe-making towns in America. Because his relationship with the world shoe industry is so great, his plans are eagerly reported by consulates of various countries to twelve countries. Bata's current situation can be briefly summarized as follows:</p>
<p>He has a fortune of ten million pounds.</p>
<p>He owns the world's largest shoe factory, employing 17,000 workers.</p>
<p>He has 2,000 retail stores.</p>
<p>His daily output now exceeds 135,000 pairs.</p>
<p>All of the above success was achieved within ten years.</p>
<p>Today, a large portion of the cheap leather shoes sold to women in Britain are supplied by Bata's factories. He recently signed a contract promising to supply a British company with two million pairs of leather shoes. Recently, he also flew to Berlin to negotiate a batch price, which is to ship five million pairs of leather shoes to the United States.</p>
<p>Whenever he travels in Europe or within his own country, he travels in his own plane, with his own pilot, because "time is money," so he cannot travel by train or steamship.</p>
<p>Speaking of Bata himself, he is a strong, hardworking villager, but he has brains and immeasurable imagination.</p>
<p>Sitting in his office in Zlin, with a rotating globe in front of him, he marks the places he wants to promote Bata shoes. Wherever he marks, his sales organization must reach the goal, otherwise, he must clearly understand the reasons why the goal cannot be reached.</p>
<p>Next to his desk, there is also a signal light, which is used to indicate which of the forty factories he has established is currently in need of his personal presence.</p>
<p>As soon as he sees the signal, he responds to the call. He has such specialized skills that he can restore various machines that have gone wrong, or instruct the foremen on how to handle certain matters.</p>
<p>In Zlin, the efficiency of all work has truly reached the fullest extent, which no British factory has ever dreamed of. As for the Zlin area itself, it is truly a strange town. In the eyes of ordinary people, it is impossible to become an important industrial area, because there is no coal nearby, no waterway transportation, and no railway. Except for a branch line, it is surrounded by chaotic mountains. This is no different from the worst location. No one can imagine that it can become industrialized.</p>
<p>If you travel by train and pass through the countryside, you can see that the workers there still rely on ox power and stick to ancient habits. Then you can see that Zlin is a new-style factory town, with wide roads, beautiful buildings, all using light, air, and electricity.</p>
<p>Forty factories stand in rows behind the grassy and tree-lined roads. Around the factories are small mountains, and workers' apartments and dormitories. Bata's reason for making Zlin the factory center is entirely based on low wages, because the cheap labor in the rural areas of Moravia is truly inexhaustible. He absorbs it, trains it, and utilizes it.</p>
<p>Whether British or American, it is difficult to stand on Bata's massive production and wage system. One cannot imagine that a small village in Moravia has achieved such results.</p>
<p>Every man or woman working in his great factory must work according to a production standard. They must do "so much" every day. If they don't do this, or can't do this, then their wages are regrettable.</p>
<p>Manufacturing leather shoes in the factory is like manufacturing cars, that is, using segmented work—a transfer system. Male and female workers, after completing their work, hand it over to the receiver, which must meet the prescribed standards, otherwise they will be punished.</p>
<p>As for wages, of course, they are very low compared to Britain, but they are much better than the low wages in any town in the Czech Republic. On average, female workers work 45 hours a week and earn fifteen shillings, but they live in dormitories prepared for them by Bata, dance in halls prepared for them by Bata, eat and drink in restaurants prepared for them by Bata, and are entertained in cinemas prepared for them by Bata. At the same time, all food items are purchased from stores opened for them by Bata. Finally, she hands over her savings to Bata and receives interest.</p>
<p>These are the secrets of Bata's success. He arranges the entire town's enjoyment facilities for the citizens, and at the same time they take out money from their earned wages to pay for the cost of his facilities.</p>
<p>According to calculations, every Wednesday, six and a half percent of all wages paid to workers last week have already returned to Bata's pocket through the apartments, restaurants, and shops opened by Bata.</p>
<p>In this town, whatever he builds, he uses his own workers. He controls all procedures of shoe-making, starting from tanning leather all the way to making a complete pair of shoes. He makes his own cardboard boxes, his own wrapping paper, and prints his own catalogs in twelve different languages.</p>
<p>The houses he built around the factory are also generally well-built—requiring only three shillings of rent per week. If a single man or woman can pay one shilling per week, they can live in his dormitory. As for food, the best meal only costs five pence in his restaurant. The cost of entering the cinema is only one penny.</p>
<p>So, a girl, although she only has fifteen shillings of income per week, can live comfortably for seven days for ten shillings, which is much better than working in the mountain village, where she only earns eight shillings per week.</p>
<p>Everything that workers need, from a hat to a motorcycle, is sold in Bata's department store in the town.</p>
<p>The most exquisite building in the town is the workers' club, which has a sports field, a swimming pool, and a very capable hospital. Bata himself lives in a simple villa, which pales in comparison to the workers' club.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the Bata system is that each individual unit must earn its surplus, even in the hospital.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>They generally have to pay money as well. If there are any losses in any part, he reduces the wages of the workers in that part. In short, they are jointly responsible for joint profits, and joint losses.</p>
<p>Anyone living in Bata's dormitory must live according to rules. They must get up at 5:30 in the morning. After getting up, they must do gymnastics, and at 7:00 they must be at work in the factory.</p>
<p>They must use their spare time in the evening in such and such a way. They must go to bed at 9:00 at night. They are not allowed to smoke or drink alcohol while working.</p>
<p>They must save a portion of their income. When they sign a work contract, they must state all the details of their personal situation, including their debts, assets, and family situation. And Bata is their master, their king, and their world.</p>
<p>The leather shoes made in Bata's factories are the cheapest goods in the world, but although the price is cheap, the quality is very good, so sales are developing day by day. His business is developing every day. At the moment—if the need arises—he can manufacture 200,000 pairs of leather shoes every day, which is more than the daily production of all the large and small factories in Northampton, a famous shoe-producing area in England.</p>
<p>He has a plan to offer to his government. According to this plan, by 1940, Zlin can become a large town with a population of 100,000.</p>
<p>He manufactures leather shoes, but he plans to manufacture other things as well, just as well as he manufactures leather shoes. His unique system has no ethical limits. He is more perfect than Henry Ford and William Morris.</p>
<p>Bata and his uncontrollable efforts of his mind have flown from Central Europe to the world. He specializes in training young men and women. The executives in his factories are rarely older than twenty-five years old.</p>
<p>What level is he going to reach? He accumulated a ten million pound fortune in ten years. He is only fifty-five years old now.</p>

<p>Expanded by 310,000 spindles last year</p>
<p>Bombay News, India's imports of cotton cloth from various countries last year decreased compared to the previous year due to the continued national movement and the adoption of protective policies. At the same time, Indian yarn mills have developed considerably, with the number of yarn spindles expanding by 318,000 last year (China 206,000, Japan 354,000). Especially between July of last year and the end of January of this year, its development status was particularly prominent among yarn mills in the Far East. Compare the list as follows (unit: thousands of spindles)</p>
<p>End of January this year End of June last year Comparison</p>
<p>India 9,125 7,907 218</p>
<p>China 3,905 3,829 76</p>
<p>Japan 7,191 7,072 119</p>
<p>Total 20,221 19,808 413</p>
<p>That is, Indian yarn mills increased by 218,000 spindles in the second half of last year, accounting for more than half of the total of the three countries, China, Japan, and India. This tendency has remained the same recently. It is predicted that the result of the third round table meeting in September of this year will have a more profound impact.</p>

<p>Facing Singapore and the British Port from Afar - Exerting Pressure on the Pacific Ocean</p>
<p>New York News: The US Navy Department plans to establish a large-scale naval air force base in San Diego, California. The cost is tentatively set at ten million gold dollars. The architectural design drawings have been completed and construction is expected to begin in mid-month. The area will become the most important center of gravity on the Pacific coast. The US Navy calls the area "one eye of the West Coast Defense Fleet," because its terrain protrudes from the West Coast, and the entire coastline stretching thousands of miles is clearly visible, making it extremely valuable for national defense. The ZRS No. 5 and Akion, known as the world's two largest flying ships, are docked in the port. The two ships have a speed of 83 miles per hour and a range of 60 miles, and can be said to be the most powerful force in the Pacific Ocean. Behind the port, a new aviator village has been established, and the families of naval aviators live in the village. The port faces the British naval base in Singapore from afar, exerting pressure on the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<h3 id="e306">The War Diary of French General Foch <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>It is surprising to see a plan of operation completed in an instant, and dispersed forces made to act in unison. Those accustomed to the slower pace of trench warfare are inevitably taken aback. Some have doubts about the outcome of this campaign, as many military experts believe that it seemed impossible for Commander Mangin to launch an offensive with five divisions before the twelfth.</p>
<p>As for me, I advocated for a swift counter-attack. Before the enemy had the opportunity to calmly deploy, our troops could catch them off guard. If our army began its counter-attack on the twelfth, the enemy would undoubtedly be prepared by the eleventh.</p>
<p>Commander Mangin's resolute attitude and clear observations ultimately convinced Commander Fayolle. He then issued an order at four o'clock on the afternoon of the tenth, requiring all armies to launch an attack on the eleventh. The order was distributed to all soldiers, with the following concluding remarks: "Our army has been on the defensive for more than two months. Tomorrow's advance will mark the end of the defensive war. This campaign will be the beginning of the German army's exhaustion and our army's regaining the offensive. We vow not to return until we have triumphed. Let all the brave soldiers of the three armies understand this."</p>
<p>Our army indeed began its attack at eleven o'clock on the morning of the following day, the eleventh. In one battle, we successively recaptured the villages of Mailly and Blérancourt, and the entire area along the Longe River was cleared. Over a thousand prisoners were captured, along with a number of artillery pieces.</p>
<p>On the twelfth, I agreed with Commander Pétain at Chantilly that Commander Mangin's advance should be stopped when the opportunity was right, to avoid losses outweighing the gains. It is now necessary to reinforce the remaining troops to prepare for any eventuality. For example, the danger from enemy forces on the Somme River front has not yet been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>The major battle had stopped. On June 14th, there were some local skirmishes. The enemy occupied the left bank of the Meuse River on the eleventh to strengthen their defensive line. The attack west of the Oise River completely ceased.</p>
<p>The enemy's halt west of the Oise River can be regarded as preparation for a large-scale attack east of the river. On the following day, June 12th, two or three German divisions launched a fierce attack north of the Fère-en-Tardenois Forest. Catres and Dommiers successively fell. French troops retreated towards Gouffre and Saint-Pierre-Aigle. However, this was still just a local conflict, and the enemy did not pursue.</p>
<p>On June 13th, the entire French line returned to calm.</p>
<p>The battle that the German army had prepared for this time was actually part of the operational plan that began on May 27th. At the beginning of this battle, the aim was to advance along the entire line between Reims and Montdidier. Due to a lack of heavy artillery and mortars, the German army could not immediately carry out a general offensive along the entire line. All that could be carried out were two battles: one east of the Oise River, the attack on the Chemin des Dames which began on May 27th, and the other, the conflict that was about to occur west of the river. The second battle could not be carried out until the artillery used in the first battle could be moved once it was no longer needed.</p>
<p>However, in the second battle, the German army could no longer gain the advantage they had in the first battle. The hasty operations caused them to neglect the detailed precautions that were taken during the May 27th offensive. Their new plan was thus quickly detected by French reconnaissance aircraft and spies. By May 30th, Commander Pétain had a clear understanding of the enemy's operational plan. The only thing that was not clear was the size of the enemy's forces. It was speculated that the enemy's forces must be very strong, because according to the calculations of the French General Staff, the German High Command had approximately sixty reserve divisions, and no fewer than forty-five divisions were adopting an offensive posture between the Oise River and the Somme River. This was more than the number of troops that launched the attack on the Chemin des Dames on May 27th. In any case, it certainly greatly exceeded the total forces that our army could deploy.</p>
<p>In reality, the German 18th Army (commanded by General Hutier), which was responsible for this battle, had only thirteen divisions deployed on the front line, covering a front of twenty-one miles. On the opposite side, the French army had seven divisions of the 3rd Army (commanded by General Humbert) on the front line, and five divisions in the second line or in reserve. Seven infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions were assembled in the rear between Pont-à-Vendin and Saint-Léonard, which could also be used as reinforcements.</p>
<p>At the start of the battle, these forces were certainly not enough to contain the German attack. However, in the days before the start of the battle, the course of events had not yet been clearly determined, and our army had to prepare for the future.</p>
<p>On June 4th, I warned Haig, "If the enemy continues to advance towards Paris between the Marne River and the Oise River, or if he expands the front, for example, between Thierelles and Montdidier, the Allied forces in France must all join the battle. This battle will determine the fate of the Great War." I asked him to prepare in detail, to transfer all of his remaining troops, the general reserves, and the independent reserve divisions to the front line, and also to consider withdrawing troops from his front. The British General Headquarters therefore had a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Commander Haig had previously been ordered to transfer three divisions of the 22nd Army Corps to the Somme River front west of Amiens. At the same time, he was still afraid that the enemy would attack between the Lys River and the Somme River (Note: On June 4th, the Bavarian Crown Prince's remaining forces numbered forty-nine divisions, of which twenty-six divisions were fresh troops). He therefore formally protested against the further withdrawal of British troops. He appealed to his home government based on the Pont-à-Vendin Agreement.</p>
<p>On June 7th, a meeting was convened at the office of the Prime Minister in Paris. Those present were Monsieur Clemenceau, Marquis Millerand, Commander Haig, Commander Wilson, Commander Lawrence, Commander Weygand, and myself.</p>
<p>Marquis Millerand said that the British government, like Commander Haig, felt uneasy about the large-scale transfer of British reserve troops, and therefore requested that this meeting be convened. I then calmly replied that I had not yet moved any British reserve troops. I had only asked Commander Haig to consider this matter and to prepare for it in case of an emergency. Moreover, unless it was a truly critical moment, I would never have the intention of exhausting all of his reserve troops.</p>
<p>This incident was easily resolved, but it shows that the Allied Supreme Commander inevitably encounters unexpected difficulties when trying to get the guest armies to understand each other. It is like an orchestra, and it takes considerable time to harmonize and tune the various instruments.</p>
<p>When the generals of the meeting, other issues were raised for discussion. Commander Wilson raised the issue that had occurred during the Battle of Flanders. He asked me what strategy I would adopt for the British army if the German army attacked Paris and simultaneously threatened the British naval base in the North Sea.</p>
<p>I repeated what I had said before. I said that my plan was to firmly maintain the connection between the French and British armies, to defend Paris and protect the coast, because they were mutually dependent on the success or failure of the Great War.</p>
<p>Disregarding the panic of the people and the governments of various countries, the enemy would soon achieve one of their primary objectives, either Paris or the Channel ports. This was indeed the case. At that time, the Allied forces were only engaged in defense, and they were inevitably exhausted. From the commander to the soldiers, no one did not feel that the crisis was imminent, and each had a sense of impending doom. (To be continued)</p>
