<h3>肇肇基離巴黎</h3>
<p>旅歐僑胞對國聯不滿</p>
<p>（巴黎）　國出席國聯施總代表三月來折衝壇望、舌敝唇焦、備極辛勞、今日以理事會又告一段落、暫去巴黎、稍事休息、目的地未悉（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今晨十時我國留學生進見施總代表要求退出國聯時、施總代表說明中國决定接受决議案之不得已苦衷、並謂渠發接受議案之演說時、將鄭重聲明日本之接受决議案、　係接受日軍必須撤出東三省而勿前進之約束、故若日仍有前進情事、或延不撤退即可視爲日本之違背理事會决議案（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）旅歐華僑代表爲中日爭端、昨晚在拉丁區内某咖啡館集會、會塲中人聲嘈雜、意氣激昻、至午夜始散、當推舉代表往見施肇基、施氏未予接見、今日午後二時至五時、華僑代表又集會一次、通過一種决議案由中國學生及新聞記者分送國聯會、其文云、</p>
<p>昨日國聯會行政院主席宣布之决議案、無論何人均不滿意、蓋該决議案旣未述及對侵略者之制裁、又未確定日軍撤退日期、僅以「願日本軍隊得以從速撤退」一語了其職責、去行政院之使命、在遇有侵略事件或有侵略之威脅或危險時、應根據盟約第十條保證被侵國之領土完整、此次中日爭端情形、何等嚴重、而解决方法乃若此、實非鄭重之道、關於調查委員會其任務依照决議草案、僅在「襄助兩國政府俾對於兩國間懸而未結各問題得以澈底解决、云云、其意若曰、必俟日本侵略業已成之後、始得命日軍撤退、又依决議草案委員團無權監察日軍之撤退因該案規定「中日兩方在軍事上所取處置、委員團無過問之權」如此云云、是不啻允許日軍繼續佔據中國土地、與攻　中國軍隊也、日本侵略原爲非法人皆知之、自有此項决議之後、而日本侵略反被行政院承認爲合法矣、此種决議案旣足以妨害中國主權、且於行政院所應維護之國聯盟約亦加破壞、故中國人民正式宣言全部拒絶之、吾人迫切要求日本軍隊不待任何談判之開始、即應立予撤退、對於犯法之日本、則要求行政院予以盟約第十六條所載之經濟上及軍事上制裁、如行政院不能收功、則對於維護和平之責不能負担、即應與帝國主義之日本分担違法之罪、事至於此、希望斷絶、吾人將退出國聯會、與其他酷愛和平之民族聯合、採取有效方法、以保障吾人之權利、且以保證世界之和平云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本刦持國聯表示志得意滿</h3>

<h3>政府當局說明施肇基之宣言</h3>
<p>（南京）政府某重要當局對國聯行政院通過决議案時、中國施代表所發之宣言、加以說明、如下（一）此次國聯行政院開會時、日本迭次要求行政院、承認日軍在東省有勦匪之權、初擬明白規定於决議案内、經中國堅决拒絶、行政院亦因日本此項主張、係屬國際創例、不予容納、繼日本要求勦匪、節、移入主席宣言内、施代表當將此節草案、電達政府、請示辦法、復經政府電令、嚴行拒絶、日方遂知中國態度、至爲堅决、對於原擬决議案及主席宣言稿、不得不予接受、僅對於决議案第二條、聲明片面之保留、當經施代表完全駁復、其宣讀之聲明書第五節稱依照决議案第二節、雙方不得有再啓戰爭或擴大事態之行動、此項規定、即不得藉口於無法紀狀態、而予以破壞、須知東省現有之無法紀將態、實爲特殊之情形所造成、而此特殊之情形、即决議案所欲剷除者也、東省受日軍之侵略、使人民之生活、失其常軌、恢復通常平安之生活、其惟、妥善辦法、厥爲迫促日軍之撤退、</p>
<p>而使中國當局得及早回復其維持治平之責任、中國不能容忍任何外國軍隊侵略並佔領其領土、更不能容許此項軍隊、攫奪中國當局之警察權）（二）日本於九月三十日及十二月十日、兩次决議案内、均承認於最短期内、將軍隊撤退至鐵路區域内、但所謂南滿鐵路區域内駐軍一節、中國始終未嘗承認有任何條約根據、華盛頓會議時、並經中國鄭重聲明、　集、故吾方對於日軍撤至鐵路區域内、　不得不爲顯明　保留、施代表迭奉外部電令後、於其聲明書第七節内、說此關於在該鐵路區域内駐紮武裝隊伍一事、中國對於其始終所持之地位、絶對不稍讓步、（三）日軍侵佔東省各地後、以利誘威脅、從事所謂新政權之組織、我方不獨不能承認、且視爲違反不得擴大事態之保證、故亦迭電施代表囑向行政院切實聲明、施代表於其聲明書第六節内謂中國對於日本所有任何圖謀、足以引起政治性質之糾紛、影響中國領土及行政之完整者、如嗾使所謂獨立運動或爲此種目的利用不法份子、認爲顯係違反避免再行擴大局勢之約言云、（十一日專電）</p>

<p>日與黨内閣以安達内相之絶對主張聯立内閣近月以來。即顯呈杌隍不安之現象。當十一月二十一日安達自陸軍演習地歸京征塵僕僕行裝甫卸之際。即發表聲明一時局刻已達到重大之地步。故如在國民之信念與决意上承認有產生以政黨協力爲基礎之國民内閣時無論在任何時期都應實行而不應作苦干之躊躇與觀望。」其主此之强硬顯然。而啓開日本政局上新轉換之序幕。中雖以政友會之反對。與若槻之主張維持現狀。使本問題暫時平息。但率以同政黨本身旣已發生不可彌縫之裂痕而最近又迭起糾紛。政府不得不負閣内不統一之責任。民政黨内閣。終將於最近總辭職而步英國之後塵。組織民政政友兩黨之聯合内閣矣。</p>
<p>日聯合内閣之成立。其最大之成功。言即爲國論之統一與外交之統一而減少其國内足以引起政治上之糾紛之危機兹後文治武治和合携手以致之步調。協作之精神。實施其大陸政策。對我國作更積極之侵略。殆毫無可疑。吾人愼勿謂日内閣更迭。將使我東北問題得有開展之希望實則日之對我侵略。爲其一貫國策。無論政友會或民政黨。雖其在手段上略有差異而其侵略我國之實質則一正如兩根不同之鑰匙其用處皆在於開鎖。此不能開則以彼來。日本内閣之更迭。聯合内閣之成立適爲其國論統一之表現其對外政策。即所謂對華政策。勢必有更進一步積極之表示也</p>
<p>吾人於此。實不能不發生深長之感喟。以國步之艱難英工黨内閣前已毅然辭職而組織混合政府。兹者日本復以所謂「時局已達到重大之地步。」。</p>
<p>民政黨内閣自動辭職。而與政友會有（一）聯立内閣之閣員。由兩黨黨員充任。（二）内閣成立後决定政策。（三）内閣由民政政友兩黨組織（四）現組内閣之命令。</p>
<p>無論降下何黨。兩黨必須協力之協定。犧牲黨見。以國事爲前提而組織聯立内閣。此種輕黨重國之精神。誠足爲世人所欽重。反觀我國。則國難日亟。而寗粤之合作。仍未見實現。北轍南轅。今仍異軌。至於國人則亦意見紛歧。目標各異。目前似已忘國外之大敵。而徒直入國内糾紛之荆棘中吁。人已協力以謀我矣。步調已一致矣。今再不醒。將待何日。當局醒來。國人醒來。國内要電二</p>

<p>中、國聯未能以光明之方法自保其尊嚴、國聯不能以自己之時間自己之條件、遣調查委員團赴滿、實屬失着、推其失敗之原因、實由於可以避免的缺乏堅决、致事之出於日本主動、不第在滿洲如是、即在日内瓦與巴黎亦莫不如是、國聯應付之問題、確屬特殊艱苦、此須加以承認者、第國聯將來對於違犯國聯會章者、是否將作籠統非司法之考慮、以代懲戒、吾人將拭目以覘之、國家資格不完全之國、固不能依國聯爲護符、但無論何國、不得不先請示於國聯、而擅自作威作福云（十一日路透社電）</p>

<p>路透社十一日東京電　内相安達近力主組織民政黨與政友會之混合内閣、以應付國家之經濟與外交問題、首相若槻則力圖保持現閣、連日商勸内達放棄其主張、否則辭職、但安達堅不爲屈、今日午後若槻召集内閣緊急會議、安達避不出席、於是若槻與其同僚乃覺舍辭職外、别無他法、因於晚間五時三十分入宫提出内閣辭職文、衆信内閣之辭職實出於財政與輕濟原因、外交猶居其次、且料重施現金出口禁令、將於本年歲杪前實行　　路透社十一日東京電　數方面現料高橋將拜命組織新閣、高橋於一秘二十丨二二年曾任首相、爲日本最著名財政專家之一、如果組閣、則閣員必以政友會中人佔其多數、而金禁令亦可保實行、蓋此爲政友會堅决政網之一也、惟對華政策、似不致有何更變、如政友會奉命組織内閣、則外交一席將予黨中之領袖但因政友會今在國會中佔少數、故組織混合内閣或民政黨改組内閣、似更近情、果爾、則外交一席將仍屬幣原、據消息靈通者聲稱、安達之主張組織混合内閣、其原因之一、爲防日本實施軍人迭克進多制、安達慮若槻内閣如再支持、則下屢國會開會時、必將有暴動的景象國人今已厭惡政黨之技倆、如國會再起暴動的景象、則國人或將因一時憤激、歡迎軍人迭克推多制云、自内閣即將辭職之消息傳出後今日證劵交易所中各種股票、價均漲高、蓋以現閣之藏相并上反對重施金禁令甚力、新閣成立後、則此令必見諸實行也、</p>

<p>又電　安達内相於下午三時提出辭呈後、若槻首相即在四時二十分閣議席上、彚集全體閣僚之辭呈、五時半參奏日皇、以政友會總裁犬養毅呼聲爲最高、大命明日可下、他如次田内務次長·高橋警視總監·岡警保局長亦相繼辭職、</p>
<p>又電　安達内相態度强硬、拒絶任何方而之勸告、與若槻首相·井上藏相·田中文相·已發生正面衝突、民政黨内以安達之舉動、頗爲反對、有提議除名虚分之說、然安達系下之議員達八十餘名、倘皆步武安達、完全脫黨、或將解散議員、亦未可知、但町田·原·兩相、恐黨内動摇、召集幹部會議、若槻下午在私邸邀賴母木總務·富田顧問·中野總務等、討論防止黨内動摇問題、形勢異常緊張、</p>
<p>國民社十一日東京電　觀於近廿四小時内東京種種經過、似日本若槻内閣之辭職、即在眉睫、惟此時則若槻猶在掙扎中、尚未决定辭職以讓聯立内閣也、内相安達刻正竭力掣牽若槻之時、今晨十時三十分召集閣議時、安達堅决不肯出席、即若槻約其相晤、亦謝絶不往、一時外間盛傳内閣已决定總辭職、但閣議經二時零五分之久、卒决定俟與安達會晤後、於午後再開緊急閣議、以定行止、但許多方面皆信若槻與黨今雖竭力掙扎、恐終不免出於辭職之一途、按昨日下午民政黨顧問廣田訪若槻、力主有改組聯立内閣之必要、於是雙方正式作戰、於以開始、若槻與政府諸領袖自午後會商至夜半、迨今晨一時二十分内閣書記官長訪安達、叩以閣潮意見、安達率然告以渠正力圖組織聯立内閣、於是事勢益急、若槻一派澈夜會議、終無良策、但若槻或能迫安達辭職、但安達若堅挺不辭、則若槻内閣亦唯有出於總辭職之一途、至聯立内閣之首相、羣料政友會犬養毅或高橋是淸最有希望、</p>

<h3>工部局之敎育計劃</h3>
<p>撥欵建築新校舍</p>
<p>本星期三工部局董事會、根據學務委員會之討論、决定將靶子路之前維多利亞育嬰院、院址中撥出一一·九九二畝、用以改建公立漢璧禮女學、工部局討論此事之情形、兹紀錄如上、</p>
<p>關於建議撥用前維多利亞育嬰院院址至少一五○八三四畝、以建新公立漢璧禮女學一事、在本月九日之董事會中、有某董事聲言謂學務委員會多數委員雖力主此議、然彼個人意見、則以爲此處地皮價旣甚高、則游戲場之地面、應縮至最小限度、蓋查他處人口繁多之大都市、在學校旁附以游戲場者亦甚少此種游戲場、大抵皆設於地價較廉之處、惟該處人口旣繁密、則留一空隙之地、亦甚有益、故如將校址所餘之地改爲一小公園、則彼亦甚贊成</p>
<p>經主席之詢問、由工務處長聲稱、如此校係照所擬之甲項計劃建築、則校舍將須接近道路若採用較大地皮之計劃、則可以使之較遠、但聲音嘈雜之弊、亦可在路旁建一高牆、略足救濟、</p>
<p>又某董事道及以此地皮建新學校之决議、將引起巨額支出、彼因知工部局對此事早經定議、但彼在從前討論中曾云、丅部局所定之敎育計劃、因其需欵之巨、或至不能實現、此計畫經納稅人在原則上予以承認、但渠仍覺此項政策、雖在今後數年内可以進行、然恐納稅人將疑工部局有無窮之欵、可供支用、故彼意凡討論有致需增稅之提議時、應留意於工部局之財政上地位、</p>
<p>又某董事建議如果建築較廉之房屋、或可以節省費用、工務處長答稱、彼意建築第一等之房屋、則爲長久計、實較合算、至關於華人小學之建築、已將職員及校工住所取消、因之所費已大减、經過討論之復、全體一致决議、撥用地一一·九九二畝、其餘之地皮則改爲一小公園云（申時社）</p>

<p>國府慰留張市長　自張市長兩電、懇請辭職後、昨日國府已有批示到滬、其批示略云、該市長自出長滬市以來、治績斐然、雖屢經重大事故發生、皆能措置得當、消滅無形、際兹國難當前、中央正深倚畀、務須益任艱巨、以慰所望、所請辭職一節、應毋庸議云云、</p>

<h3>孫科重要談話</h3>
<p>東省問題希望軍人自動起來</p>
<p>學生救國運動乃爲必然之理</p>
<p>粤代表孫哲生、昨日爲東三省問題、及學生救國運動、及汪先生提議之召集國民救國會議事、對各通信社記者發表談話如下、記者（問）先生對東三省問題、最近有何意見、（答）東三省已喪失了好幾個月、日本之侵略、仍日進無已、而南京政府除了靠國際聯盟外、簡直毫無辦法、在此種現狀下、我以爲只有希望全國有血氣的軍人、不要再去問他們長官什麽無抵抗的命令、多多地自動起來、帶兵去東三省、鞏固國防、恢復失地、最近馬占山的死力</p>
<p>抵抗、張發奎的請纓援黑、便是兩個最好的軍人榜樣、如果有軍人自願做馬占山張發奎、我相信全國的人民、一定一致地援助、無論在精神方面、或物質方面、都可以給他很大的帮助的、最近廣州學界、爲援馬占山發起募捐、不過在幾天内、竟捐到一百幾十萬、民衆救國的熱極、於此可以概見、而吾人於此、亦應知道要救國、只有尊重民意、與民衆切實合作、才有辦法、才能發生最大效力、（問）先生對近日學生救國運動、意見如何、（答）在此國家遇着空前的危難的時候、學生丢開書本、來做救國運動、乃是必然道理、因爲他們係全國人民中比較爲智識的份子、假如在這個時候、連他們都袖手旁觀、置國事於不聞不問、那末中國還有救嗎、近年來全國民衆、事事都不敢有所表示、社會上看慣了、便難免覺得學生這次的救國運動、過於囂張、其實這次學生的舉動、正是民主國家的民衆應有的行爲、所以我以爲現在不但學生應自動起來、做救國的工作、便是其他各個的民衆、也應該積極勦作起來、已有組織的、把力量充實、組織不好的、把組織弄健全、還没有組織、趕快組織起來、必如此才能羣策羣力、集中全國人民的力量、去抵抗帝國主義的槍砲兵艦的侵略、（問）先生對汪精衛先生提議、召集國民救國會議、意見如何、（答）根據我剛和的談話、我相信你一定知道我是完全贊成的、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>黑馬得偶</h3>
<p>— 姜晝禪</p>
<p>昨晨謁馬　孟容於斜橋容齋。閒閱自由談。悉陶在東君徵求黑馬之偶。以褒忠勇。亟告孟師。師應聲曰。紅羊。細繹之。對意頗巧整。蓋宋理宗時。柴望上丙丁絶鑑十卷。自秦莊襄王五十二年丙午。迄五季後漢天福十二年丁未。通一千二百餘年。中爲丙午丁未者二十有一。其年皆値中國有亂事之年。望上書意欲托言識諱。以儆戒時君。每人以丙屬火色赤。未爲羊。遵謂國難之時爲紅羊刦歲。今歲適在辛未。復遭國難紅羊可稱黑馬之巧對。</p>
<p>願當局諸公引爲龜鑑焉。又太平天國時亦稱紅羊之亂。蓋爲洪（秀全）楊（秀淸）之諧音。當時佔據十六省。聲勢極盛。設非曾左輩効忠滿淸。則神州早已光復。現國府明令謂太平天國爲民族革命之先聲。不得以叛逆稱之。紅羊之抗滿。與黑馬之抗日。同爲吾中華民族之光榮。以之屬對。未知在東君以爲合否。</p>

<h3>一個敎師與家長的答覆丨出頭處要自由丨（下）</h3>
<p>「戴君認定你們靑年是國家的命根，我也有此認識。你們也不可把自己小看了。不可做樹少爺！不可做樹小姐！不可給折腰的大樹把你們籠罩住！與害蟲奮鬥！伸出頭來向水分，肥料，空氣，陽光進取！這樣，你們纔能把自己造成中國之棟樑之材，纔可算是國家命根的靑年。　　「我旣主張出頭處要自由，那麽「自由」的涵義是什麽也得說明。自上是以自己的行動。團體自己是以團體自己的意志指揮團體自己的行動。自由這個名詞是含有自主，自决，自動，自得種種意義，擴而大之，是要各得其所。自由人是奉頭腦做總司令他的反面是奴隷。他自己不願做奴隷也不要人做他的奴隷。放蕩不是自由因爲放蕩的人是做了私慾嗜好的奴隷而不能自拔。一個人若做了私慾嗜好的奴隷便失掉自由。靑年放蕩固然不能成人；成年人放蕩也只算是成年不能算是成人。成年人，靑年，小孩子都該在一個道德標準下生活。雙層標準，三層標準只是恕道不足的結果。靑年不可以假借自由之美名去過放蕩的生活；敎師家長也不可假借放蕩之罪名去剝削靑年小孩子生長所必需之自由。根據以上所說我所得的斷語，適與戴君相反。我的斷語是：</p>
<p>「失掉自由，不能成人。」（完）</p>
<h3>馬占山將軍佚聞</h3>
<p>— 朶白</p>
<p>黑省主席馬占山將軍。於倭奴横行無忌。傾師來犯時。獨能於黯淡之無抵抗空氣下率其健兒。以禦强寇。雖衆寡懸殊。而爭先殺賊。屢建奇勳。宜乎國人聞之。懽忻歌舞。紛紛捐資援助。記者於欽仰將軍之餘。特將平日所聞關於將軍之片段。錄之以投自由談。</p>
<p>將軍字秀星。吉林烏拉鎭人。其家素業農。至將軍始棄農從戎。初隷吳俊陞部。僅充正目。無藉藉名。其後累以剿匪有功。漸次擢升。至黑廉明公正。卓卓威聲。黑人無不敬崇之。將軍視日人夙深痛恨。時欲創之。此次目擊當道之不抵抗。尤覺憤慨欲死。故抗禦日軍。益見其神勇不可當也。</p>
<p>將軍少好習拳術。而未嘗入學校。故至壯歲猶目不識丁。惟自近年以來。感於不識字之不便。每於治軍餘暇。執卷研讀。孜孜不輟。故於公文函牘。已能批閱。亦</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>喜馬拉耶山上之古族　英國女探險家高斯蘭白德女士MissJ.Cossley-Batt九年前曾在喜馬拉耶山人迹不到的高處發見却爾定Chaldeans古民族。今年女士約同孟德里粤Montreal城的培爾博士Dr.I.Baird前往。作第二度的訪問。此族自數百年來。久已世界相隔絶。人口在六百至八百之間。其地在一萬七千尺以上的高處。與西藏相近。人民極其健康。大都長壽。爲世界任何民族所不及。他們日常的食品。完全是菜蔬。住的是山窟。並無屋宇。然而文化的程度極高。實在埃及人之上。可謂世界文化的鼻祖。他們的手中有許多名貴的文稿與畫件。都是該族先人的手筆。培爾博士此次曾帶回一畫。已是七百五十年前的古物。對於醫藥方面的事物。也多所發見。二人一路前去時。曾迭交偶險。有一次被一個蠻族所襲擊。幾乎同遭非命。末了即終於達到目的地。最近已滿載而歸了。</p>
<h3>鐵梗海棠著花</h3>
<p>— 啟楣</p>
<p>蘇州桃塢中學。處地靜僻。花木扶疏。故校景向以淸幽著。中樓之前。植鐵梗海棠一株。每年暑春三月。娟娟作花。花繁小而色澹紅。當其盛時。滿樹纍纍。如少婦紅暈。迎風含笑。妖艶風韻。洵不減扶桑之櫻花。不圖於上月中澣。朔風慘慄木落草荒之際。忽吐葉萌蕾。放花達十數朶。且其花朶迭相陳謝。雖忍寒至今。尚未斷花。碧葉紅葩。嬌翠欲滴。若不以風霜爲苦者。考植物循時榮枯。今此花逆時而放。豈獨無因。故亟錄之。敢以質諸海内博物家焉。</p>
<p>嘗提筆作擘窠大字。雄偉奔放。骨格天然。不愧英雄手筆也。</p>
<p>將軍天性純孝。事老母晨昏定省。數十年如一日。母偶病。必親侍湯藥。不輕假手於人。又好周人之急。戚友之因貧求貸。及外客之來乞援者。無不慨然立允。不責其償。故爲官多載。依然兩袖淸風。了無餘蓄。</p>
<p>將軍於兵法戰術。以其歷年經騐所得。獨具卓見。彼自詡某軍校某軍校出身者。對之每懐慚色。如此次所掘之戰壕。據某外國專家觀察後之報告。謂其精美合度。佈置奇奥。在中國實爲第一次所見。何怪日人見而寒心。不敢輕於對壘。</p>
<p>將軍除擅拳術外。又能手持雙槍同時並發。百步内無勿中者。其部下得所楷模。並得將軍之嚴密訓練。故於槍法亦不弱。此次能以窳劣之器。破舊之彈。擊落日車飛機三架。及屢擊退堅兵大砲者。即發槍之準確故也。</p>
<p>將軍自奉甚儉約。除偶一御中國之絲綢品外。對於舶來品絶不服用。若日貨則並其家中人而拒納之。善識技人。凡具一技之長。一藝之精者。輒留之幕中。設法安揷。故其部下頗多奇能傑出之士。又能與士卒同甘苦。賞罰嚴明。毫不假借。故將士無不樂於用命。此次數勝倭軍。蓋非倖致也。</p>
<h3>何香凝抗日之未雨綢繆</h3>
<p>— 君强</p>
<p>何香凝女士憤暴日之肆横。恐一旦不幸而有戰事發生。救護之事實爲當務之急。自宜及早預備。因出己作之書畫並徵集各名家墨寳。在滬舉行展覽。以所售得之資。移作創辦婦女抗日救護養成班之用。該會進行事務業由鄭洪年蔡孑民葉譽虎柳亞子朱少屏汪英賓李秋君劉海粟王濟遠孫雪泥謝公展虞澹涵錢瘦鐵張善孖李祖韓唐冠玉薛保倫賀天健等分任一切。規模甚大。聞所徵集之書畫。皆爲海内各大名家作品。共五百件。售劵五百張。每劵定三十元。由鄭洪年君推銷。另立古畫陳列處。則其價不在此限。何女士爲黨國先哲廖仲愷先生夫人。廖先生爲反對帝國主義謀中國之自由平等而犧牲者。何女士繼續先生未竟之業。而能持堅毅果敢之精神以與一切奮鬥。實爲我中國婦女界中傑出人才。其藝術之精神。聲名早播遐邇。加以諸大名家之傑作。平時不易得到者。乘此皆可以數十元之代價而得爲子孫傳世之寳。間接復能解紓國難。於公於私。爲益大矣。該會展覽之期。定在本月月底舉行云。</p>

<h3>睇嚮齋逞談</h3>
<p>— 甘簃</p>
<p>岑春萱（下）</p>
<p>迨郵傳部尚書畀春萱之旨下。春萱首請罷黜侍郎朱寳奎。指其好貨不解事。寳奎旣免官。卿相以下多懐疑懼。戯以猛虎呼焉。其時粤匪勢復張。世凱乃密謀於奕劻。謂調虎離山之機已至。當以術使春萱外遷。庶幾可免其日伺吾人之隙。譖諸后。議由吾發。公内應。劻大喜。於是世凱專疏痛陳粤匪甲天下。起伏無寗歲。春萱曾治粤。而　苻滅跡。足見得其人而治。失其人而亂。兼圻之寄。匪異人任。后果動容。顧劻曰。世凱所云如何。劻對曰。世凱之言。天下之公言也。春萓之才。天下之人皆欲得而爲長官也。於粤爲尤甚。后頷首。即降旨。召春萱入。后曰。汝謀國之忠。治事之勇。不自今日始。於未開府前。予已默識於心。進階之速。帝勿與。予所主張。收拾粤局之責。舍汝莫屬。鳳池之還。要非無因。汝其敬愼將事。春萱唯唯。不禁汗下。蓋先已得報。知奕劻世凱内外相呼應。共謀去之。含怒出都。道經海上。濡滯不行。劻凱復謀使不得之粤任。陰授計於人。取康有爲及春萱單人影相片。裂而復合。作並立狀。重撮一影。進於扣。　言岑康方會於滬。密議廢后雍帝。如戊戍之變。后頓思往事。未審其詐。勃然震怒。曰。予固知春萱曾與保皇會。祗以勤王之役。察其行。不似。自是歷筦疆圻。頗能振作有爲。詎料猶懐異志。近叛黨。圖老婦耶。雖然。其功不可掩。其德未能忘。姑予開缺可己。劻凱之計酬。而春萱不白之寃。乃莫由申訴遂家於海上。辛亥蜀亂。監國攝政王載澧納震國公載澤之請。起春萱馳往查辦。已復授川督。未行。南北已停戰言和。疆吏聯銜乞遜位。春萱亦列名。受政府使。至閩省勘亂。復拜漢粤川鐵路督辦之命。降志屈身以事世凱。殊不類其素行。或曰。爲貧而仕。豈其本志哉。其後討袁之役無不與。因遠走南洋羣島以避。中間說陸榮廷舉兵抗洪憲。榮廷宿隷萱部下。懐德圖報匪朝夕。至是。迎萱入羊城。設軍務院於肇慶。衆推唐繼堯爲撫軍長。推春萱爲副撫軍長。攝行撫軍長事。不翅偏安之副座權元首也。旣受職。爲文通告。謂世凱朝退。萱夕隱。卒踐言下野。嗣復置身廣州軍政府。爲主任總裁。退後。不復出。十年於兹矣。論萱之爲人。爲政尚猛。御下惟嚴。性剛而言爽。遇事輒持已見。倔强不爲人所屈。是不無可取者。獨於共和以後世凱之使命。或拒。或納。予人以口實。如寵信某伶。授以兵柄。亦有累盛名。然而。小疵不足以掩大節。殆所謂君子之過歟。</p>

<h3>與子同仇（十）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>忠淑聽了。蛾眉雙鎖。說道不錯。這幾天風聲不甚穩妥。一旦有事。鐵道都在他們手裏。我們一些没有防備。如何是好呢。華乃强嘆道。西人譏笑我們國家爲睡獅。似乎醒起來大可有爲。我國民也有以此自負。其實我國早成一頭奄奄待斃的病獅。絲毫不中用。太陽國人早已看破。在他們說起來。也好引用天與不取反受其殃這兩句話咧。國必自伐而後人伐之。前淸在外交上種種失敗。貽害無窮。但自辛亥革命以來。忽忽二十年。内亂紛紜。没有已日。國民革命後。京粤分裂。何嘗有統一的日子呢。都壞在這些執政的手裏。所謂上下交征利而國危矣。不然我國人受了許多恥辱。五九咧。五三咧。五卅咧。前事不忘。後事之師。爲什麽到今日還不能振作起來呢。說什麽十年生聚。十年敎訓。我國人祗有口頭愛國。實際上一些根基也没有建築。自然那裏能夠不遭强鄰的侵伺呢。可恨可恨。華乃强說到這裏。立起身來。拔出腰間寳劍。寒光森森。這劍就是校長熊鳳贈送與他。常常佩在身上的。他面上露出激昂的頽色。慨然對忠淑說道。古人聞雞起舞。心懐故國。好男兒亦當如此。河山黯淡。寇氛已起。正吾人報國之時。聞雞而起舞。也是被平旦之氣激動了愛國之心。現在有許多靑年。可惜都不能保持這平旦之氣。反而旦旦而伐。自暴自棄。受了惡魔的引誘。以致走上墮落之途呢。說罷。將劍一擺。颼颼地舞將起來。但見漸舞漸緊。一道白光罩着他的人影。忽東忽西。倐起倐落。忠淑在傍甚是好看。這時有幾個同學遠遠地望見了。一齊跑過來瞧看。愈聚愈衆。圍成一個圈兒。忠淑也立起身來。和一個女同學爬到榆樹上去看。華乃强把一路劍舞完。霍地收住。立定身軀。氣也不喘。衆人都拍起手來道。飛將軍多才多能。忠淑也把纖手拍着。跳下樹來。天色漸漸黑暗。噹噹地鐘聲響將起來。晚膳時間到了。於是大家擁到餐室裏去。不料他們方進着最後的一餐呢。</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Administrative Council Plans to Form an Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Issues an Eight-Point Statement Regarding the Resolution</p>

<p>Over a Thousand Students from Peking Petition the National Government</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Investigation Team's Members are Not Yet Confirmed</h3>
<p>Drafting Committee Met Yesterday to Discuss</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council Drafting Committee met this afternoon to discuss the organization and selection of members for the investigation team. However, it is expected that the selection of all members will likely take several more weeks. According to current plans, the qualifications for the five members are proposed to be: one a legal expert, one an expert in Far Eastern affairs, one a leading figure in the business community, one an engineer, and one an economic expert. Currently, the Chinese delegation quite favors New York banker Mr. Taylor for the American member. Reportedly, Mr. Taylor is a member of the Democratic Party, has served as a financial commissioner in various European countries, was an American member of the European Armistice Commission, and has been employed by the League of Nations to determine Mr. Mermel's position.</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council had just announced that all council members unanimously accepted the resolution when a semi-official telegram arrived at the Secretariat, reporting that Japanese troops were advancing towards Jinzhou. The situation suddenly became tense. This was at 6:20 PM. The council members then held a closed-door meeting. Afterward, the Secretariat announced that the information in the telegram regarding the Japanese troops advancing towards Jinzhou was not confirmed. The public was relieved, and the closed-door meeting adjourned at 6:40 PM. It is heard that the discussion mainly focused on the expenses of this Council meeting and the investigation team's funds. (Guomin News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Hastily Concludes</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoji States his Views and Reservations</p>
<p>Small Nations Worry About Infringement of Sovereignty</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council, having met for almost four weeks, concluded its discussion on the Manchurian issue this afternoon in the public hall, eventually passing its resolution. The U.S. Ambassador to the UK, Dawes, did not attend the closing meeting. At 4:42 PM, the chairman gave an opening address, inviting the Japanese representative, Mr. Yoshizawa, to speak. Yoshizawa first thanked the members for the Administrative Council's acceptance of his request to postpone yesterday's public session to today. He then expressed the Japanese government's gratitude for the Administrative Council's efforts in handling the Manchurian issue. He continued that special circumstances made this issue difficult, namely the great distance and conflicting interests. The Administrative Council handled this issue with a spirit of conciliation, goodwill, and patience, responding appropriately, so the draft was completed and is the best solution. He has been instructed by his government to accept this proposal, with the understanding that the Japanese military's actions in Manchuria to protect its nationals and suppress bandits will not be hindered by the second clause of this proposal. The Chinese representative, Dr. Shi, then spoke at length, with eight points, stating that the Chinese government is willing to implement in good faith the various obligations arising from accepting the proposal as explained by Briand. This proposal is practical, aimed at addressing immediate concerns. For the sake of complete understanding, China must record certain observations and reservations in principle as follows:</p>
<p>(1) China reserves all rights and remedies under the law, which China is entitled to according to the League of Nations Covenant, existing treaties, and international conventions.</p>
<p>(2) This proposal and all current arrangements in Briand's declaration can be regarded as a practical plan, including four mutually connected essential elements: (A) immediate cessation of hostilities, (B) ending the Japanese military's occupation of Manchuria in the shortest possible time, (C) neutral observers reporting on future developments, (D) a committee dispatched by the Administrative Council to conduct a detailed investigation on the entire situation in Manchuria on the ground.</p>
<p>(3) China maintains and expects that when the committee stipulated in the proposal arrives in Manchuria in the future, if the Japanese troops have not yet completely withdrawn, its primary duty will be to investigate the Japanese troop withdrawal and to report to the Administrative Council and present suggestions on withdrawal methods.</p>
<p>(4) China believes that the proposed method does not directly or indirectly hinder the issue of compensation for losses suffered by China and its people due to recent events in Manchuria.</p>
<p>(5) When China accepts this proposal, it is grateful for the Administrative Council's advice to China to avoid any actions that could re-ignite war, or any behavior that could exacerbate the severity of the situation, in order to prevent further war and bloodshed. It must now be stated that this advice should not be used as an excuse to disrupt. The current disruption is caused by the situation that this proposal aims to eliminate. The many disturbances in Manchuria are caused by the Japanese military's invasion. Therefore, the only way to restore normal life is to expedite the withdrawal of Japanese troops. China cannot tolerate any foreign troops occupying its land, nor can it allow foreign troops to seize the police power of the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>(6) China notes with satisfaction the intention to continue improving the existing system of neutral country observers and reports from other countries' representatives.</p>
<p>(7) China's agreement to the proposal stipulating the withdrawal of Japanese troops into the railway zone does not constitute a waiver of its consistent position regarding the maintenance of troop numbers in the railway zone.</p>
<p>(8) China will regard any action by Japan that creates political disputes and damages China's territorial and administrative integrity (such as instigating independence movements and using troublemakers to achieve this purpose) as a blatant breach of its undertaken commitments.</p>
<p>After Dr. Shi finished speaking, the British representative, Cecil, stood up and said that since the Chinese representative accepted this proposal, he would like to thank him. The Administrative Council has heard the Japanese representative's explanation regarding the second paragraph of the proposal. In his opinion, the situation in Manchuria is difficult, and an extraordinary situation may arise that endangers the lives and property of Japanese people. If that were to occur, the Japanese may need to suppress bandits, but this situation is extraordinary and will cease once normal conditions are restored. The Spanish representative, Madariaga, said that Yoshizawa's remarks did not conflict with the proposal, and that his words corresponded to the spirit and wording of the proposal. The chairman, Briand, then submitted the proposal for voting, which passed unanimously. Briand then spoke about the Manchurian situation, saying that although the Administrative Council has not decided on a date for the Japanese military withdrawal, it deeply hopes that the Japanese military will withdraw as soon as possible. The Administrative Council has avoided war for three months, and its negotiations have delayed the chances of war. He cannot imagine how the two countries present at the Administrative Council could commit the outrageous act of starting a war in front of world opinion. Briand then mentioned Jinzhou, saying that neutral country observers have reported that the Japanese troops have withdrawn, and the Chinese troops are not preparing for war. Therefore, the Administrative Council can foresee that even without a formal demilitarized zone, hostilities will not occur again. As for negotiations on this type of zone, no agreement has been reached. Briand concluded by saying that the participation of the United States indicates its consistent meaning of cooperation with the Administrative Council. Cecil stood up and spoke in agreement with Briand's remarks, saying that the Administrative Council, in accordance with Article 10 of the Covenant, has achieved a solution by using persuasion instead of arbitration. The success of this solution depends entirely on both parties. If either party disrupts the reconciliation efforts, they will bear a great responsibility before the world. The members of the investigation team are going to Manchuria with a major task, and all those with good intentions, including both parties, will sympathize with them. The representatives of the Latin American countries strongly stated that this proposal deals with a very complex situation and should not be regarded as a precedent, and should not hinder the sovereignty of weak countries and the principle of non-interference. After everyone finished speaking, Dr. Shi stood up and said that if the implementation of the treaty is limited to the Manchurian border, then it is not acceptable to China. This meeting lasted one hour and forty-three minutes and adjourned at 6:25 PM. Some representatives are leaving Paris tonight. Cecil will return to England tomorrow. The Drafting Committee still needs to meet for two or three days to discuss the details of the investigation team. The British Ambassador to France, Tyrrell, will represent Cecil at the Drafting Committee. The other two members are Briand and Madariaga. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Several representatives of small countries, especially those from South American countries, believe that this solution is a precedent that powerful countries may use in the future as a reason to occupy weak countries by force. Therefore, they raised several reservations on behalf of various small countries. The most important one was raised by the Peruvian representative, Rada, and fully supported by the representatives of Panama and Guatemala. The arguments made by these three countries can be seen in the summary of Mr. Rada's speech, which also expresses the various concerns of the small countries. Mr. Rada said, "I want a peaceful resolution to this dispute and will never hinder it. Therefore, I support this clause, but the survival and rights of small countries have little security without relying on certain principles. This security does not advocate force, and it is the greatest purpose of the League of Nations. It depends on the protection afforded by the above principles. The clauses formulated by the Executive Yuan must not hinder these principles. Among these principles, special attention should be paid to: (1) No country has the right to occupy by force; (2) No country has the right to use military force to invade the territory of another country. The meaning of the original treaty between the two countries, as well as its legal value, must not be forced to conduct direct negotiations, nor does it have this right; (3) All countries have the right to protect the lives and property of their people. The exercise of this right should respect the sovereignty of other countries. No country can send troops to another country for this protection in order to take police action, nor does it have this right; (4) A country has no right to occupy or detain the property of the debtor country or the country that has granted the right to discuss the organization and selection of members of the League of Nations Executive Yuan's investigation team, and Sun Weiru's troops occupy Lanzhou (see Domestic Important Telegrams). The Japanese Wakatsuki Cabinet resigns (see Foreign Important Telegrams). American student Hong Weiji is arrested in the French Concession and released on bail by the Municipal Government. The National Government orders Chen Mingshu to thoroughly investigate the student petition case (see Local News).</p>

<p>and other rights for debt or economic concessions. The compulsory repayment of debts has no room for enforcement in accordance with the principles recognized by the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907. We approve the handling methods recognized by the two involved countries in order to immediately prevent war. In any case, it cannot be considered as abandoning various legal principles in international affairs, because these principles are related to the protection of the rights and interests of small countries, and their independent lives are also guaranteed by this." (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Council Chairman Briand stated when closing the public meeting that he hoped that after the Council's resolution was accepted by both parties, it would prove in fact that great progress had been made in the settlement of the Sino-Japanese Liaoning case. He also hoped that the withdrawal of Japanese troops would not be delayed for too long, and said that the crisis of war had been avoided. The Council's efforts had eased the course of events. I do not believe that after both parties have accepted the resolution, there will be any unexpected new incidents. Today's resolution will not affect the theory that the League of Nations bears various responsibilities determined by the Anti-War Pact. He also expressed his hope that although there is no establishment of a neutral zone, a demilitarized zone will soon appear. We can also see Mr. Briand's attitude here. British representative Cecil claimed, "I agree with Mr. Briand's conclusion. We have negotiated a very important outcome. Its success depends on both parties involved. If either party breaks their promise, the party that breaks the promise first must bear a great responsibility, because in today's world, no country has the right to act on its own." Peruvian representative Palada claimed that no country can use force against others to force them to recognize treaties. If a country occupies another country's territory and forces it to negotiate directly, it is negotiation under force. Guatemalan representative Madus claimed that the League of Nations Covenant, the Anti-War Pact, and other conventions have determined the principles of international law applied by the Hague Conference in 1907. Polish representative Zapolski only stated that the Sino-Japanese Liaoning case dispute has special characteristics, so the Council must use special methods, etc. Because Poland's situation is different from that of Central and South America, it believes that this statement is sufficient.

<p>(Paris) Our country's Chief Representative Shi today at the negotiation of the Liaoning case</p>
<p>expressed his strong rebuttal and refused to agree with the statement that international treaties and conventions cannot be applied to the three northeastern provinces, and stated that there is no abnormal situation in Jinzhou. The Chinese government has heard recommendations to change its current state. (Guomin News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Stimson Still Hopes for Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson commented on the Manchurian dispute today, saying that the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution is a real step forward, but he still believes that the final solution must be achieved by China and Japan themselves through an agreement, but it must not be resolved through the pressure of force. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Leaves Paris</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Europe Dissatisfied with the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Paris) For three months, Mr. Shi, the Chief Representative of China attending the League of Nations, has negotiated on the diplomatic stage, exhausting himself and working extremely hard. Today, with the Council coming to a temporary end, he is leaving Paris for a short rest. His destination is unknown. (Guomin News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning at 10 o'clock, Chinese students called on Chief Representative Shi, requesting withdrawal from the League of Nations. Chief Representative Shi explained the difficult circumstances of China's decision to accept the resolution, and said that when he made a speech accepting the resolution, he would solemnly state that Japan's acceptance of the resolution is accepting the constraint that Japanese troops must withdraw from the three northeastern provinces and not advance. Therefore, if Japan still advances or delays its withdrawal, it can be regarded as Japan's violation of the Council's resolution. (Guomin News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Overseas Chinese representatives in Europe held a meeting in a cafe in the Latin Quarter last night regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. The meeting was noisy and emotions were high, and it did not disperse until midnight. Representatives were elected to see Shi Zhaoji, but Mr. Shi did not receive them. From 2 PM to 5 PM this afternoon, the overseas Chinese representatives held another meeting and passed a resolution, which was distributed to the League of Nations Council by Chinese students and journalists. The text reads:</p>
<p>No one is satisfied with the resolution announced by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the League of Nations yesterday. The resolution did not mention sanctions against the aggressor, nor did it determine the date of withdrawal of Japanese troops, and only used the phrase "willing for Japanese troops to withdraw as soon as possible" to fulfill its duties. The mission of the Administrative Council is to guarantee the territorial integrity of the invaded country in accordance with Article 10 of the Covenant when there is an invasion or a threat or danger of invasion. The situation in the Sino-Japanese dispute is so serious, but the solution is like this, which is not serious. Regarding the investigation committee, its task, according to the draft resolution, is only to "assist the governments of the two countries in thoroughly resolving the various outstanding issues between the two countries," meaning that the Japanese troops will only be ordered to withdraw after the Japanese aggression has already been completed. According to the draft resolution, the committee has no right to supervise the withdrawal of Japanese troops, because the case stipulates that "the committee has no right to interfere with the military measures taken by the two parties." This is tantamount to allowing Japanese troops to continue to occupy Chinese land and attack Chinese troops. Japanese aggression was illegal, as everyone knows. After this resolution, Japanese aggression was recognized as legal by the Administrative Council. This resolution not only harms Chinese sovereignty, but also destroys the League of Nations Covenant that the Administrative Council should uphold. Therefore, the Chinese people formally declare their complete rejection of it. We urgently request that Japanese troops withdraw immediately without waiting for the start of any negotiations. For the law-breaking Japan, we demand that the Administrative Council impose the economic and military sanctions contained in Article 16 of the Covenant. If the Administrative Council cannot succeed, it cannot bear the responsibility of maintaining peace and should share the guilt of breaking the law with imperialist Japan. At this point, hope is cut off. We will withdraw from the League of Nations and unite with other peace-loving nations to take effective measures to protect our rights and guarantee world peace. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japan Seizes the League of Nations to Express its Triumph</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a long article in various newspapers, stating that the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution expressed pleasure at the Chinese government's silent acquiescence to an agreement that seemed unfavorable but was actually sufficient to increase the interests and happiness of the Chinese people. Then it listed the characteristics of the resolution and explained the benefits of the investigation committee's work, but at the same time stated Japan's opinion. Striving to prevent promises that are enough to cause war and loss of life does not mean abandoning the right to self-defense. The article went on to say that the investigation committee should first investigate the various matters in China that need their attention, so that the League of Nations can better understand the situation in the Far East, so their work should contribute to the maintenance of peace. The article also suggested that the investigation committee must investigate issues such as the anti-foreign movement, the boycott of China, the protection of foreigners' lives and property, and China's attitude towards treaty obligations. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Government Authorities Explain Shi Zhaoji's Declaration</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important government authority explained the declaration issued by Chinese representative Shi when the League of Nations Administrative Council passed the resolution, as follows: (1) During the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, Japan repeatedly asked the Administrative Council to recognize the Japanese military's right to suppress bandits in the eastern provinces. It was initially planned to clearly stipulate it in the resolution, but China resolutely rejected it. The Administrative Council also believed that this claim by Japan was an unprecedented international case and did not accept it. Subsequently, Japan requested that the bandit suppression section be moved into the Chairman's declaration. Representative Shi sent this draft clause to the government by telegram, requesting instructions. After receiving the government's telegram order, it was strictly rejected. The Japanese side then knew that China's attitude was very firm and had no choice but to accept the original proposed resolution and the Chairman's declaration draft, and only declared a unilateral reservation on the second clause of the resolution. Representative Shi completely refuted it in his statement, section 5 of which states that according to section 2 of the resolution, neither party should take actions that would re-ignite the war or expand the situation. This provision should not be destroyed on the pretext of lawlessness. It should be known that the current state of lawlessness in the eastern provinces is caused by special circumstances, and these special circumstances are what the resolution seeks to eliminate. The Japanese military's invasion of the eastern provinces has disrupted the lives of the people. The only proper way to restore normal and peaceful life is to expedite the withdrawal of Japanese troops,</p>
<p>and allow the Chinese authorities to resume their responsibility for maintaining order as soon as possible. China cannot tolerate any foreign troops invading and occupying its territory, nor can it allow these troops to seize the police power of the Chinese authorities. (2) In the two resolutions of September 30 and December 10, Japan admitted that it would withdraw its troops to the railway zone in the shortest possible time. However, China has never admitted that the stationing of troops in the so-called South Manchuria Railway Zone has any treaty basis. At the Washington Conference, China made a solemn statement, so we had to make a clear reservation regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops to the railway zone. After Representative Shi repeatedly received telegram orders from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he said in section 7 of his statement that regarding the stationing of armed troops in the railway zone, China would absolutely not yield on its consistent position. (3) After the Japanese military occupied various places in the eastern provinces, they engaged in the so-called organization of new regimes through enticement and threats. We not only cannot recognize it, but also regard it as a violation of the guarantee not to expand the situation. Therefore, we also repeatedly telegraphed Representative Shi to earnestly state to the Administrative Council that China regards any attempt by Japan that is sufficient to cause political disputes and affect China's territorial and administrative integrity, such as inciting so-called independence movements or using illegal elements for this purpose, as a clear violation of the promise to avoid further expanding the situation. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied that the Associated Press reported that Representative Shi was in direct negotiations with Japan and stated that it was absolutely untrue. Representative Shi also did not indicate that Chinese troops could withdraw from Jinzhou. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Change in the Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>The coalition cabinet of the Japanese Minseito party, with Interior Minister Adachi's absolute insistence on a coalition cabinet, has shown signs of instability in recent months. On November 21, when Adachi returned to Tokyo from the army exercises, dusty and still in his traveling clothes, he issued a statement saying, "The situation has reached a critical point, so if the people's beliefs and determination acknowledge the creation of a national cabinet based on cooperation between political parties, it should be implemented at any time without hesitation or waiting." His strong advocacy was obvious, and it opened the prelude to a new transformation in Japanese politics. Although the Seiyukai party opposed it and Wakatsuki advocated maintaining the status quo, which temporarily calmed the issue, the cracks within the same political party have become irreparable and disputes have repeatedly arisen recently. The government has had to take responsibility for the lack of unity within the cabinet. The Minseito cabinet will eventually resign en masse recently and follow in the footsteps of the UK, forming a coalition cabinet of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties.</p>
<p>The greatest success of the establishment of the Japanese coalition cabinet will be to unify national opinion and diplomacy and reduce the crisis of domestic political disputes. From now on, the steps of harmony and cooperation between civilian and military governance will be taken to implement its continental policy and engage in more active aggression against our country. There is little doubt about this. We must not think that the change in the Japanese cabinet will give us hope of developing the Northeast issue. In fact, Japan's aggression against us is its consistent national policy. Whether it is the Seiyukai or the Minseito party, although their means are slightly different, the essence of their aggression against our country is the same. Just like two different keys, their purpose is to unlock the lock. If this one cannot open it, then the other one will be used. The change in the Japanese cabinet and the establishment of the coalition cabinet is precisely a manifestation of the unification of its national opinion. Its foreign policy, the so-called policy towards China, will inevitably have a more active expression.</p>
<p>At this point, we cannot help but have deep feelings. With the difficulty of the country's situation, the British Labour Party cabinet had already resolutely resigned and formed a coalition government. Now, Japan is also using the so-called "the situation has reached a critical point."</p>
<p>The Minseito cabinet voluntarily resigned and reached an agreement with the Seiyukai party to (1) fill the cabinet members of the coalition cabinet with members of both parties, (2) determine policies after the establishment of the cabinet, (3) organize the cabinet by the Minseito and Seiyukai parties, (4) the current order to form the cabinet.</p>
<p>Regardless of which party is in power, the two parties must cooperate in an agreement, sacrificing party opinions and forming a coalition cabinet on the premise of national affairs. This spirit of valuing the country over the party is truly admirable to the world. On the other hand, in our country, the national crisis is becoming more and more urgent, but the cooperation between Ning and Yue has not yet been realized. The cooperation is still going in different directions. As for the people of the country, their opinions are also divided and their goals are different. It seems that they have forgotten the great enemy outside the country and are only directly entering the thorns of domestic disputes. Alas! People have already cooperated to plot against us, and their steps have been unified. If we don't wake up now, when will we wait? May the authorities wake up and the people of the country wake up.

<h3>English Commentary on the League of Nations' Achievements in March by British Newspapers</h3>
<p>Taking This as a Protective Charm Should Provoke Deep Thought</p>
<p>London. Of the London morning newspapers, only The Times carried an editorial commenting on the League of Nations Administrative Council's final plan to resolve the Manchurian dispute. It expressed slight criticism of the methods used by the Administrative Council in fulfilling its work. The newspaper stated that in the eyes of critics,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>the League of Nations failed to protect its dignity through transparent means. It was a misstep for the League of Nations not to send a commission of inquiry to Manchuria according to its own timeline and conditions. The cause of its failure stemmed from an avoidable lack of resolve, leading to Japan taking the initiative. This was the case not only in Manchuria but also in Geneva and Paris. It must be acknowledged that the problems the League of Nations faced were indeed exceptionally difficult. However, we will wait and see whether the League of Nations will resort to broad, non-judicial considerations in place of punishment for future violations of the League's charter. Nations with incomplete qualifications should certainly not rely on the League as a protective charm, but regardless of the country, all must first consult the League of Nations before acting arbitrarily (Eleventh day Reuters dispatch).</p>

<h3>Hu Hanmin Discusses People's Representative Bodies</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hu Hanmin stated on the 11th that he highly agreed in principle with Wang Jingwei's proposal to organize representative bodies from people's organizations to discuss diplomacy with the government. However, in my opinion, this type of organization should not only be established to deal with the current diplomatic situation, but should be permanently retained to supervise the government in the future. Furthermore, there are three points in Wang's proposal that should be supplemented: First, the representatives of this organization must truly represent public opinion and should be primarily from the academic, labor, agricultural, and commercial sectors. Those who do not represent any sector should be excluded. Second, this organization should be located in Shanghai, not Nanjing. Third, if any representative cannot represent public opinion, the organization to which they belong should immediately recall them. (Eleventh day special dispatch).</p>
<h3>Zhou Longguang Takes Office as Acting Mayor of Tianjin</h3>

<p>(Tianjin) In the afternoon of the 11th, reporters visited acting Mayor Zhou. According to him, he had personally negotiated with the Japanese during the Tianjin Incident. Currently, the Japanese consul-general's attitude is very good, and the defensive works in the Japanese Concession will gradually be removed. He also hoped that the defensive works of the British, American, French, and Italian concessions would also be removed soon to allay the suspicions of the citizens. When asked whether Tianjin could be stable from now on, he replied that this question was difficult to answer. The actions of the Japanese often deviate from the bounds of reason. Tianjin and the Northeast are interconnected, and the way the Tianjin situation will change can only be known by observing how the situation in the Northeast is resolved. When asked whether the Japanese reinforcement of troops in Tianjin and the transportation of a large amount of military supplies were based on treaty stipulations, he replied that our country has been plagued by incessant internal strife, and the Japanese, under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese, have increased their troops in China. The national rights that our side has lost are all outside the scope of the treaties. For example, the stationing of Japanese troops within the South Manchuria Railway line has no basis in treaties. Our countrymen did not pay attention at first and failed to vigorously contend, leading to today's Northeast Incident. The order of the city is improving day by day. In my opinion, the end of the year is approaching, which is the time for merchants to settle their accounts. I intend to shorten the curfew to alleviate the suffering of merchants. I will discuss this with Police Chief Wang tonight. It would be even better if the curfew could be lifted. (Eleventh day special dispatch).</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>The Wakatsuki Cabinet Collapses</h3>
<p>Adachi Does Not Relax His Coalition Cabinet Stance</p>
<p>The Seiyukai President Will Succeed in Forming a Cabinet</p>
<p>Policy Towards China Will Become More Aggressive</p>
<p>Reimposing the Gold Standard Is Inevitable</p>
<p>Kokumin Shimbun, Tokyo, 11th - Prime Minister Wakatsuki presented his cabinet's resignation to the Emperor at 5:30 PM today, and the Emperor immediately approved it. It is expected that a coalition cabinet will be formed, with the Seiyukai President, Inukai Tsuyoshi, taking responsibility for forming the cabinet. However, before Inukai comes forward, Wakatsuki or Takahashi Korekiyo may attempt to form a cabinet once again. It is expected that Japan will ban gold exports after this cabinet change, or even temporarily suspend the gold standard. Regarding the Manchurian Incident, it is feared that Japan will become even more stubborn.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 11th - Interior Minister Adachi has recently strongly advocated forming a mixed cabinet of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties to deal with the country's economic and diplomatic problems. Prime Minister Wakatsuki has been trying to maintain the current cabinet and has been persuading Adachi to abandon his proposal, otherwise he would resign. However, Adachi firmly refused to yield. This afternoon, Wakatsuki convened an emergency cabinet meeting, but Adachi avoided attending. Therefore, Wakatsuki and his colleagues felt that there was no other way but to resign, so they entered the palace at 5:30 PM in the evening to submit their cabinet's resignation. It is widely believed that the cabinet's resignation was due to financial and economic reasons, with diplomacy being secondary. It is also expected that the reimposition of the cash export ban will be implemented before the end of this year. Reuters, Tokyo, 11th - Several sources now expect Takahashi to be ordered to form a new cabinet. Takahashi served as Prime Minister in 1921-1922 and is one of Japan's most famous financial experts. If he forms a cabinet, then most of the cabinet members will be from the Seiyukai party, and the gold ban can be guaranteed to be implemented, as this is a firm policy of the Seiyukai. However, there are unlikely to be any major changes in policy towards China. If the Seiyukai is ordered to form a cabinet, the foreign affairs portfolio will be given to the leader of the party. However, because the Seiyukai is currently in the minority in the Diet, it seems more likely that a mixed cabinet or a reorganized Minseito cabinet will be formed. If so, the foreign affairs portfolio will remain with Shidehara. According to well-informed sources, one of the reasons for Adachi's proposal to form a mixed cabinet is to prevent Japan from implementing a military dictatorship. Adachi fears that if the Wakatsuki cabinet continues to support it, there will be riots when the next Diet convenes. The people are now tired of the tricks of the political parties, and if riots break out again in the Diet, the people may welcome a military dictatorship out of temporary anger. Since the news of the imminent resignation of the cabinet spread, the prices of various stocks on the stock exchange rose today, as the current Minister of Finance strongly opposes the reimposition of the gold ban. After the new cabinet is formed, this order will certainly be implemented.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 11th - The Minister of the Imperial Household will be ordered to consult with the elder statesman, Duke Saionji, on the selection of the new Prime Minister. Because it will take time to travel back and forth, the appointment of the new Prime Minister will not be made for at least 24 hours.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th - Kawazaki, the cabinet secretary, visited Interior Minister Adachi at 1:20 AM today on the orders of Prime Minister Wakatsuki to inquire about his true intentions. If Adachi did not accept the advice to resign and remained stubborn, the cabinet would inevitably collapse. However, Adachi has always refused to give up his proposal for a coalition cabinet, so Wakatsuki took responsibility for the lack of unity within the cabinet and decided to submit his resignation at an emergency meeting held at 10 AM today.</p>
<p>Another Telegram - After Interior Minister Adachi submitted his resignation at 3 PM, Prime Minister Wakatsuki gathered the resignations of all cabinet members at 4:20 PM in the cabinet meeting room and presented them to the Emperor at 5:30 PM. Seiyukai President Inukai Tsuyoshi is the most popular candidate, and the imperial command may be issued tomorrow. In addition, Vice-Minister of Interior Tsuta, Superintendent-General of Police Takahashi, and Director of the Police Bureau Oka have also resigned in succession.</p>
<p>Another Telegram - Interior Minister Adachi's attitude is tough, rejecting any advice, and he has clashed head-on with Prime Minister Wakatsuki, Finance Minister Inoue, and Education Minister Tanaka. Within the Minseito party, Adachi's actions are quite opposed, and there is talk of expelling him. However, Adachi has more than eighty members under him, and if they all follow in Adachi's footsteps and completely leave the party, or even dissolve the members, it is unknown. However, ministers Machida and Hara fear that the party will be shaken, so they convened a cadre meeting. Wakatsuki invited Chief Secretary Raemki, Advisor Tomita, Chief Secretary Nakano, and others to his private residence in the afternoon to discuss the issue of preventing the party from being shaken. The situation is extremely tense.</p>
<p>Kokumin Shimbun, Tokyo, 11th - Observing the various events in Tokyo in the past 24 hours, it seems that the resignation of the Wakatsuki cabinet is imminent. However, Wakatsuki is still struggling at this time and has not yet decided to resign to allow a coalition cabinet. Interior Minister Adachi is currently doing his best to restrain Wakatsuki. When the cabinet meeting was convened at 10:30 this morning, Adachi firmly refused to attend, and even refused to meet with Wakatsuki when he invited him. For a time, there were rumors that the cabinet had decided to resign en masse, but after a cabinet meeting lasting two hours and five minutes, it was finally decided to wait until after meeting with Adachi before holding another emergency cabinet meeting in the afternoon to determine what to do. However, many believe that Wakatsuki and the party, although struggling hard, will ultimately be forced to resign. According to reports, Minseito advisor Hirota visited Wakatsuki yesterday afternoon and strongly advocated the need to reorganize the coalition cabinet. Thus, the formal battle between the two sides began. Wakatsuki and government leaders consulted from afternoon to midnight. At 1:20 AM this morning, the cabinet secretary visited Adachi and asked for his opinion on the cabinet's situation. Adachi bluntly told him that he was trying to organize a coalition cabinet, which intensified the situation. Wakatsuki's faction held a meeting all night but could not come up with a good plan. However, Wakatsuki may be able to force Adachi to resign, but if Adachi firmly refuses to resign, the Wakatsuki cabinet will have no choice but to resign en masse. As for the prime minister of the coalition cabinet, it is widely believed that Seiyukai's Inukai Tsuyoshi or Takahashi Korekiyo has the best chance.</p>

The police claim that party members in the Foreign Ministry secretly planned to infiltrate Manila and meet with local party members to launch an uprising on an agreed date. Therefore, since last night, the police here have launched a massive crackdown, arresting a total of 160 people so far and charging them with sedition. All have been detained.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Rejects Japanese Temptation</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Increases Troops in Qiqihar to Prepare to Attack Ma</p>
<p>Zhang Jinghui's Attitude Remains Ambiguous</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, The Japanese army stationed in Qiqihar sent a letter to Chairman Ma of Hailun on the morning of November 30th in the name of Division Commander Domon, proposing the following four conditions: (1) If Ma Zhanshan can persuade the Chinese troops in Keshan and Tai'an to surrender, he can notify Advisor Arai. (2) If Ma Zhanshan determines the date of his return to the province, he can also notify Advisor Arai in advance, and Shaozu Lin can personally go to Tai'an to welcome him. (3) Shaozu Lin guarantees that Ma Zhanshan's life will be safe. (4) Ma Zhanshan is allowed to bring 80 guards into Qiqihar. Chairman Ma ignored the letter after receiving it, believing that there was no need to reply. The Japanese army, believing that Ma has a firm determination to counterattack, urgently transferred more than 3,000 heavy artillery cavalry from Liaoning last night to Qiqihar, which is expected to arrive today or tomorrow. There are currently about 1,000 Japanese troops stationed in and around Qiqihar. The security of the provincial capital is under the control of the Japanese side and is maintained by the takeover committee sent by Zhang Jinghui. The takeover committee sent by Zhang arrived in Qiqihar on November 28th. The chairman of the committee is Ying Shun, the deputy director of the Special Zone Police Administration. The members are Li Hanchuan (former member of the Senate), Song Wenlin (chairman of the Special City Supervisory Committee), Zhang Lanjun (former director of the Special Zone Police Bureau), Zhang Jingbi (former commander of the Feng Army), Liu Tingxuan (former advisor to the Governor's Office), etc., and they brought the first squadron of the second battalion of the Special Zone Provisional Garrison. When they took the train from Harbin on the evening of the 27th, the Russian side of the East Railway refused to allow the garrison to board the train with weapons. After much negotiation, they were allowed to board empty-handed, and the firearms were shipped separately. A certain Harbin newspaper published an extra issue on that day, stating what positions the takeover committee members would hold. When Zhang Jinghui saw it, he immediately ordered Gao Qidong, the director of the Binjiang Public Security Bureau, to seal up the newspaper and punish it with a three-day suspension. Therefore, the general public does not know Zhang's true intentions. Yesterday, Zhang published a notice in various newspapers, stating that sending personnel to Qiqihar was purely to maintain order. The original text is as follows: "To Whom It May Concern, This official's dispatch of Ying Shun, the deputy director of the Special Zone Administration, to Qiqihar, leading a garrison team, is purely for the sake of the empty defense of the provincial capital of Jiang Province and to assist in maintaining public order. However, some busybodies have fabricated rumors and published them in extra editions, falsely claiming that so-and-so is the director of the department and so-and-so is the director of the bureau, which are purely rumors and have no basis. Therefore, this is published in the newspapers to clarify the truth. This notice." It is heard that after the garrison arrived in Qiqihar, they were stationed in the Dongguan Public Security Branch Bureau. The order of the city streets is still checked by the Japanese army. At the same time, Zhao Zhongren, a well-known traitor in Heilongjiang Province, is using long-distance telephone calls to Ma Zhanshan in Harbin every day to discuss Zhang's visit to Qiqihar, requesting Ma to hand over the seals of the military and civilian agencies in Heilongjiang Province, and saying that Director Zhang is in charge of Heilongjiang's administration only temporarily. If the situation is peaceful, the power will still be returned to Ma. Ma replied that the seals were received from the central government, and they must be handed over with the central government's order. Director Zhang's visit to Qiqihar to maintain public order is greatly appreciated. Since he is not interested in Heilongjiang's territory, there is no need to hand over the seals. Although Zhao received such a reply from Ma, he still did not give up and continued to pester Ma with telephone calls every day. Ma could not bear it and once ordered Chief of Staff Xie Ke and others to answer the phone when Zhao called. Therefore, Zhao's plan for Zhang Jinghui has not yet been achieved. It is heard that Zhang Jinghui has a persistent attitude towards the political power of Heilongjiang Province. He originally wanted to go to Qiqihar himself to implement the rule, but he feared Ma Zhanshan's counterattack and was afraid that the Sino-Japanese incident would be resolved and the Japanese would withdraw in the future, and he would have no way to face the people. If he does not go, he is both coveting the territory of a province and has the instigation of those around him and the pressure of the Japanese. Therefore, he took the method of avoiding the name and occupying the reality, and personally obtained the Qing Dynasty, and actually sent personnel to Qiqihar to administer on his behalf. On Ma Zhanshan's side, he is still perfunctory and dare not refuse. (December 2nd)</p>
<h3>Military Attaches of Various Countries Stationed in Japan Pass Through Harbin to Qiqihar</h3>
<p>International Transport Company Smuggles Shells to Harbin</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, Lieutenant Colonel Simpson, the military attache of the British Embassy in Japan, Lieutenant Colonel Mark Kellog of the US Embassy, Major Baron of the French Embassy, Major Vilosiorto of the Italian Embassy, and Major Lachman of the Polish Embassy, ​​departed from Tokyo on November 22. Under the complete encirclement of the Japanese, they successively investigated various places in Liaoning and Xinmin. On the morning of the first day of this month, at 7:55 AM, they came to Harbin from Changchun. The Japanese still gave them extreme surveillance. After getting off the bus, they were guided to live in the Japanese North Manchuria Hotel in Daoli. At noon, the Japanese Consul held a grand banquet to entertain them. All Chinese and foreign journalists who visited were blocked. Even the consuls of their respective countries stationed in Harbin were unable to talk to the military attaches for a long time. A reporter from a certain White Russian newspaper in this city chased them for half a day, and finally met them at a certain Japanese hotel at around 2 PM, and talked to the Italian military attache for a few words, but it was not important. He refused to talk about what he found in the investigation. He said, "We came to the East Province this time at the invitation of the Japanese government and as guests of the Japanese, so everything is in contact with the Japanese side and has nothing to do with the Chinese side, and has nothing to do with the League of Nations. Now we will go to Jiang Province, Taonan and other places, and then return to Japan via Harbin." When the Russian reporter asked about the impressions of this trip, he refused to tell him, only saying, "We are soldiers and cannot express our opinions to journalists. Moreover, there are still Jiang Province, Taonan and other places that have not been fully investigated, so we cannot tell you. When the investigation is completed, we will make a systematic report to our government," and so on. At 2:40 PM, they took a car straight to the station and took a bus to Angangxi. Japanese Consul Oohashi led hundreds of embassy staff and other Japanese residents to the station to greet them. The French Consul, the Italian Consul, and the Polish Deputy Consul also went to the station to see them off.</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 1st), the East Railway freight car transported ten bales of cotton from Changchun to Harbin. The words "International Transport Co., Ltd." were written on the bales. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the porters at the freight station unloaded the freight car. The average porters have a lot of experience in unloading goods, and they also have a considerable estimate of the weight of the goods. However, on this day, after carrying the cotton bales, they felt that the weight was unusual. At that time, Chinese staff member Qi was on the side to take care of the unloading. The porters were carrying and talking to themselves, saying, "Why are these bales of cotton so heavy? I don't know what's going on with these bales of cotton." Qi did not care much about the porters' casual talk. At that time, Yuan Xingye, a patrol officer from the first section of the road police, was patrolling here and heard the porters' words. He looked at the cotton bales and saw the words "International Transport Co., Ltd." written on the bales, which made him suspicious. Lately, there have been rumors outside that a certain country is transporting weapons in the goods to Harbin. So he ordered the porters to stop and asked if it was true that the cotton bales were too heavy. The porters replied that ordinary cotton bales are not so heavy. I don't know what's going on with this cotton bale. Yuan became more suspicious after hearing this, so he used his hand to stroke the inside of the cotton bale, but unexpectedly touched the handle of a box gun, and realized that there were indeed firearms hidden inside, but he didn't know if there were other things. So he quickly ordered the porters to open the cotton bales, and with the eyes of the Chinese and Russian stationmasters of the freight station, he checked them, and found that there were two box guns and two wooden boxes in the bale. The words "Made by Fengtian Mortar Factory on May 3, 17th year" were written on the wooden boxes. After opening them, there were actually four mortar shells inside (four in each bale, a total of eight shells. Inside the bale, there are two boxes). The Russian stationmaster of the freight station reported to the Road Bureau, and Patrolman Yuan reported to the Road Police Department and the Railway Protection Army Headquarters. At about 2 PM, the Road Bureau sent two Russian inspectors, the Railway Protection Army Headquarters sent two inspectors from the station inspection office, and the Road Police Department sent the section chief of the first section to the station. The Russian inspectors sent by the Road Bureau opened each bale and inspected it. It was estimated that each bale contained two wooden boxes, and each box contained four mortar shells, for a total of ten bales of cotton, containing 20 boxes, totaling 80 rounds. The shell is about one foot long and three inches in diameter. According to the road regulations, such contraband should be confiscated. So the Russian inspectors sealed the original items on the original freight car. It was decided to send a letter to the customs today (2nd) for certification, and then the Road Bureau will confiscate them and hand them over to the Railway Protection Army Headquarters for safekeeping. As for how to deal with the shipper, nothing has been heard. It is also heard that there are more than forty pieces of this cotton bale, and 30 pieces have been picked up by the International Transportation Company. It is thought that there must be a lot of firearms hidden in them. (December 1st)</p>
<h3>Jinan Students Petition Southward</h3>
<p>Han Fuju Orders to Prepare Cars</p>
<p>Left Jinan by Special Train on the Evening of the 8th</p>
<p>He Siyuan Telegraphed to Resign from Beijing</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, The students in this city who went to Beijing to petition yesterday (7th) still had no results in negotiating for vehicles. More than 2,000 people spent another night sleeping on the platform. Lei Taiping, the garrison commander, specially ordered the station to vacate the North Reception Hall of the General Station and the ticket office for the students to enter, but it could not accommodate them. There were still people sleeping on the platform. When the principals of the girls' schools arrived at the station, they persuaded the girls to return to school to sleep, but all the girls refused to return. Many students were sick. When their parents heard about it, they came to the station to visit them, and they were all filled with tears.</p>
<p>Petition and Lectures Conducted Separately - At 6 AM today, the delegation of representatives of various schools held another meeting and resolved: (1) Petition the provincial government to negotiate for vehicles. (2) Detain any south-bound or north-bound trains that arrive at the station. (3) Divide into ten groups to give lectures and telegraph to all schools in the province to ask for their assistance. After the meeting, they set off separately. The first group was on Weisi Road, the second group was at Pulimen, the third group was at Jinpu Station, the fourth group was at Jiaoji Station, the fifth group was at Xinximen, the sixth group was in front of the park, the seventh group was at Xinshichang, the eighth group was at Baotu Spring, the ninth group was on Fuche Street, and the tenth group was at Nanguan. The lectures exposed the suffering of the Japanese invasion and occupation of the Northeast and the continuous wind and rain at the station. The listeners were like walls, and everyone was moved.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government's Petition Results Were Satisfactory - A total of fourteen schools (Donglu Middle School joined today) with 2,000 students petitioning students were divided into 25 teams, and each team elected five representatives to go to the provincial government to petition. At 10 o'clock, they set off from the station. Wang Kairu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, stepped forward to dissuade them, saying that he had ordered the preparation of the cars, so there was no need to go to the provincial government to petition. The students did not agree and still went. At 11 o'clock, Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government, accompanied by He Siyuan, the director of the Education Department, and Wang Kairu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, personally came out to meet them in front of the reception hall. First, Han said, I have ordered the preparation of the cars, and you are about to leave. The student representatives said that they have suffered a lot at the station for days, and asked the chairman to help prepare the cars to go to Beijing. Han said that he would hang up the cars and let you go. The representatives said that they had said they would drive the cars several times before, but they never did. Han said that it was not that I didn't teach you to do things in a unified system, it was the orders of the railway. For example, your students belong to the Education Department and also have a unified system. The reason is that Commander-in-Chief Chiang has ordered the petitioning students to postpone their trip to Beijing. The petitioning students in Nanjing made a little mistake again, so even if I let you go, I am afraid that it will be labor without success. In fact, you are enthusiastic to go, and if you arrive in Nanjing, people will say that Shandong students have arrived, which is also very good for me. The representatives said that we have discipline and will not have any accidents after arriving in Beijing. Han said that the discipline of the petitioners in other places is not bad either. If you don't keep order, it will be easier to solve. At this point, the students saluted Han and withdrew.</p>
<p>The Station Prepares Cars and Traffic Resumes - At 12 o'clock, the representatives returned to the station and reported the satisfactory results of the petition to all the students. The station had already started preparing the cars, and the 2,000 students burst into tears. The atmosphere on the platform was no longer the same as before. The station hung up six of the seventh cars occupied by the high school and nine of the tenth cars detained by the students into one train, but it was still not enough. Fifteen more cars were added. It is heard that the 202nd car that was detained can also go north today, and the first car that was parked at Sangzidian can also enter the station and head south. There is hope that traffic will resume.</p>
<p>Beijing Students Trapped in Dezhou - More than 2,500 students from Beijing took a special train with a total of 18 cars. Wang Shuchang sent four adjutants to escort the train south. Last night, the train arrived in Dezhou, and the driver suddenly ran away. It is heard that the railway was ordered not to allow the train to go south, and it was stopped in Dezhou. The stationmaster of Dezhou telegraphed to Chairman Han to report. Han immediately telegraphed to Li Hanzhang, the commander of the 85th Brigade stationed in Dezhou, to send troops to the station to maintain order. At 1:30 PM today, the car started to head south from Dezhou.</p>
<p>Chanting Slogans, the Special Train Heads South - The petitioning students in this city totaled about 2,000 people. Because the cars were not enough, the number of cars was increased from 15 to 30, with two locomotives, one pushing and one pulling. After all the students boarded the train, it was already 6:05 PM. The special train then started to head south. The whole body chanted "Down with Japanese imperialism" Recover the three northeastern provinces by force "Withdraw from the League of Nations" Swear not to return to Ji""Hope that the people of Jinan will unite and fight against the outside world" and other slogans. With a whistle, the train left the station.</p>
<p>The Director of the Department of Education Telegraphed to Resign from Beijing - He Siyuan, the director of the Department of Education, repeatedly dissuaded the students in Jinan from going to Beijing to petition this time, but to no effect, violating the central government's orders. Therefore, on the 7th, he telegraphed to President Chiang of the National Government and Minister Li of the Ministry of Education, taking the blame and resigning. The telegram to President Chiang is recorded as follows: "President Chiang of Nanjing, Since the Liaoji Incident occurred this time, the patriotic expressions of students from all over the country have been surging. Zhi has strictly ordered the principals of various schools in Lu Province to abide by the central government's orders and guide and persuade them. The results are still good. As soon as the wind of petitioning opened, the students in Jinan had repeatedly planned to go to Beijing to petition. Zhi supervised and led the principals of various schools to dissuade them and give up. Unexpectedly, the petitioning groups from various schools in North China all passed through Jinan to and from Jinan. The students were stimulated by this and were forced by their patriotic enthusiasm. They organized a petition group and went to the station to wait for the bus to set off. Zhi恪奉钧令,切地劝导，虽各生上守秩序，而请愿之心坚决不懈。The students have no cars to ride, and they have decided to set off on foot. Zhi has no image and education is wrong, and he has failed his heavy trust. He hates himself and feels ashamed. In addition to having telegraphed to the Ministry of Education to allow him to be removed from his current position in order to show his vigilance, Jiang will tell this telegraph and respectfully ask for your attention. Zhi He Siyuan asks,” (December 8th)</p>
<h3>Xiamen University Students Petition in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Central University and Xiamen University Jointly Petition the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Japanese army occupied our Northeast, the national populace was exceptionally indignant. Yesterday, all the students of Xiamen University also traveled a long distance to Guangdong to jointly petition the Fourth Plenary Session with Sun Yat-sen University of Guangdong Province. The petition delegation consisted of three male student teams and one female student team, each with approximately sixty people, totaling around three hundred students nationwide. The male students wore military uniforms made of yellow-slanted cloth, and the female students wore white inner garments with black ties, plus long blue cloth skirts. On the cloth armbands of both male and female students were written eight characters: "Unite, Struggle, Avenge, Save the Country." Coming to Guangdong, they took the route via Shantou. Arriving in Hong Kong at ten o'clock on the morning of the second, they took the Guangzhou-Kowloon train to the province that afternoon. Personnel from Sun Yat-sen University were dispatched to the station to receive them and led them to the liberal arts and science college of Sun Yat-sen University for rest. All faculty and students of Sun Yat-sen University held a welcome meeting in the auditorium of the liberal arts and science college at eight o'clock on the morning of the third, and decided to jointly petition the Fourth Plenary Session by Sun Yat-sen University and Xiamen University. The petition objectives were: (1) Request the government to promote peaceful unification and unite against foreign aggression; (2) Request the swift dispatch of troops to recover the lost territories of the three northeastern provinces; (3) Request the government to quickly transfer the Fourth Army under Zhang Fakui northward to assist Heilongjiang; (4) Request the government to allow student volunteer armies from various schools to depart with the regular troops and declare war on Japan; (5) Request the government to urgently assist General Ma Zhanshan; (6) Request the government to strengthen Zhang Fakui's military equipment; (7) Request the government to allocate firearms and military supplies to the volunteer armies; (8) Request the government to issue medical supplies to the rescue teams of various schools. Subsequently, the students of Sun Yat-sen University and Xiamen University formed a procession and departed, totaling over eight hundred people. When they arrived at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, the Ninth Session of the Fourth Plenary Session was in progress. Sun Yat-sen University nominated Ma Jingzeng, Wang Guanshun, Li Shaohua, Xu Zhian, and Deng Shitong as representatives, and Xiamen University nominated Liu Sheng, Chen Hong, Zhu Guohua, Zhang Kena, Zhou Chengji, and Hou Guoguang as representatives to submit their petition. The Fourth Plenary Session appointed Li Yangjing of the presidium to respond. The Xiamen University students also requested five items from the Fourth Plenary Session: (1) Request the members of the Fourth National Congress to hold a peace conference in Beijing; (2) Request the government to order its subordinate troops to dispatch troops within one week; (3) Accelerate the completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway within three months to facilitate transportation; (4) Request that the murderer Du Xuantai, who massacred civilians, be executed on the spot in Hankou; (5) Request a written response to all the points requested by the two schools. Li Zongren responded that the members of the Fourth National Congress would go to Beijing before the fifteenth, but the students thought it was too late, so it was changed to before the tenth. All points two, three, four, and five were accepted. The students were satisfied and withdrew. On the fourth, the student representatives of Sun Yat-sen University and Xiamen University returned to the Fourth Plenary Session to await a written response. The first written response from the Fourth Plenary Session stated briefly that all the points of the petition would be fully accepted and submitted to the congress for ratification and implementation, hoping that the students would return to school and focus on their studies, etc. The student representatives considered the response too general. After conveying it back to school, the Xiamen University students again formed a procession to petition the Fourth Plenary Session. They waited until five o'clock in the afternoon, when the Fourth Plenary Session concluded its meeting and handed the response letter to the Xiamen University student representatives. Liu Sheng, a representative of Xiamen University students, read out the reply letter, which stated: "In response to your school's petition, the presidium of this congress, together with the response opinions, submitted it to the congress, and it was ratified by the Eleventh Session of the congress in its entirety. However, regarding the dispatch of troops to recover the lost territories of the Eastern Provinces, according to the report of the Military Affairs Commission forwarded by the National Government, active preparations are underway, but the route of dispatching troops still needs to be considered (omitted in the middle). Regarding the expedited completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the Fourth Central Party Department should urge the National Government to handle it. It is hereby declared that the Central Committee members here have decided to go north before the fifteenth of this month after being elected. The corresponding record is hereby communicated, and it is hoped that you will take note of it." After listening, the Xiamen University petition delegation formed a procession and withdrew.

<h3>Resolution of the Xiangtan Student-Police Conflict Case</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the Xiangtan student-police conflict occurred, all sectors of the provincial capital believed that Liu Yicheng, the director of the Xiangtan Public Security Bureau, deliberately sabotaged the patriotic movement and brutally killed students. They unanimously requested the government to severely punish him. The Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, upon hearing that the Party and government authorities had scheduled a joint meeting at the Provincial Party Headquarters at eleven o'clock on the morning of the seventh to resolve the case, decided to hold a general petition at that time and surround the Party and government committee members to strive for a satisfactory resolution. On the morning of that day, over two thousand people gathered at Sun Yat-sen Hall at nine o'clock, chaired by Liao Jin, who explained the details of the tragic case and the meaning of the petition today. Subsequently, the entire group set off. When they arrived at the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Party and government joint meeting was in progress. After the representatives submitted the petition, Party Committee Member Huang Jiasheng and Provincial Committee Member Huang Shiheng came out to negotiate and explained that the Party and government meeting had decided on: (1) Liu Yicheng, the director of the Xiangtan Public Security Bureau, would be dismissed and handed over to the court for punishment; (2) Chen Qihong would be arrested and brought to justice; (3) The Xiangtan Public Security Bureau would be ordered to compensate the injured students for medical expenses and losses; (4) A circular would be issued throughout the province to protect the patriotic movement; (5) The juvenile promotion activities would be corrected. Finally, they added encouragement. The representatives requested that Cao Bowen, the director of the Civil Affairs Department and the acting chairman, personally come out to report. After repeated requests, the Party and government committee members went to Sun Yat-sen Hall as a group. First, Cao Bowen reported, stating briefly that everyone's petition today was very orderly, and he did not take this tragic case lightly, and he also expressed sympathy for the patriotic movement. The requested items have been decided separately and are now being implemented. He hoped that everyone would return to school to inform them and wait for a solution. Later, Party Committee Member Xie Zuyao explained in detail. The students were still dissatisfied and raised three requests: (1) Execute the murderer Liu Yicheng by shooting; (2) Confiscate Liu Yicheng's family property to comfort and compensate the victims; (3) Issue a circular to all localities to effectively protect the patriotic movement, and request that these three items be immediately submitted to the Party and government joint meeting for decision, and urge a telegram to the Xiangtan County Government to detain Liu Yicheng and escort him to the province for punishment. Cao Bowen replied that the first two items were of great importance and should be submitted for discussion after Chairman He returned to the province. As for the third item, protecting the patriotic movement, a circular could be issued to all localities to comply with. The students were satisfied, shouted slogans supporting the government, and left in formation. After Cao returned to the Provincial Government, he immediately ordered Liu Yicheng's dismissal and handed him over to the court for investigation. The vacant position of director of the Xiangtan Public Security Bureau was reassigned to Xiu Ganzhong. A telegram was sent to the Xiangtan County Magistrate stating that the director of the county's Public Security Bureau's handling of the case involving the county's students' anti-Japanese propaganda and the negotiation with Chen Qihong, an employee of the telegraph bureau, resulted in a violent incident in which students were injured. His measures were improper. Liu Yicheng, the director of the Xiangtan County Public Security Bureau, Sun Weihou, the section chief, and Qi Zhinan, the liaison officer, should all be dismissed and escorted by the county magistrate to the Higher Court for investigation and punishment according to the law. The Public Security Bureau should be held responsible for compensating the injured students for medical expenses. Chen Qihong, an employee of the telegraph bureau, has fled and should be wanted in a separate case and brought to justice to appease public anger and serve as a warning. In addition to issuing a circular to all counties to pay attention to protecting the patriotic movement, please comply with it. (December 7th)</p>

<p>Farmer Shooting Case Tried in Suzhou In the tenth district of this county, a group of farmers petitioned the tenth district office, but were shot and killed by the police team at the Pawnshop Bridge, killing four people. Later, Shen Zhongshan and other citizens of the district believed that Wang Hongyu, the district chief, was suspected of instructing the shooting, and filed a complaint with the provincial authorities. Subsequently, the Civil Affairs Department dismissed Wang, ordered the county watch camp to await the designation of the court by the High Court for trial. Later, fourteen district chiefs of the county bailed Wang out pending trial. The High Court designated the Wuxian District Court, and the trial was scheduled for yesterday (10th). The plaintiff Shen Zhongshan, the defendant Wang Hongyu, and the police squad leader Jin Dingxun, Special Agent Li, etc., were summoned to Suzhou for interrogation. According to the plaintiff, the district chief Wang went to the countryside to arrest people on the night before the incident. When passing through Luhe Town, he opened fire. At that time, the people suspected them of being bandits due to the unsettled atmosphere of bandits, so they fled in all directions, and some waded into the water to escape. Wang Hongyu said that the shooting was not his intention, but the intention of squad leader Jin. Jin directly admitted it without hesitation. As a result, all defendants were ordered to be detained, and the plaintiff was ordered to return home to await further summons for interrogation.</p>

<p>False Fire Alarm Recently, there have been frequent false fire alarms in the city of this county. At 11:30 p.m. on the 8th, the Jianxin Fire Brigade of the vinegar store Qiao received a report of a fire, saying that someone surnamed in Huayuanbang outside the South Gate was negligent. The fire brigade immediately used the telephone to inquire about the second police station outside the South Gate. The reply was that it was true, so the fire bell rang wildly. As a result, all the fire brigades in the city gathered at Huayuanbang and asked the nearby residents everywhere, but they all said that they had not heard of a fire. All the members of the fire brigade went to question Cha Henian, the director of the Jianxin Fire Brigade. He replied that it was reported by the second police station. At that time, the members were indignant and wanted to destroy the second police station. Fortunately, Fang Desheng, the patrol officer of the police station, mediated and no disaster occurred. As a result, they demanded (1) a thorough investigation of the rumor-monger, (2) an apology to the fire brigades, (3) the Dong District Fire Brigade proposed to dismantle the alarm bell of the Jianxin Fire Brigade, etc. Patrol Officer Fang properly solved the problem, and the members returned to their respective brigades. The next day, just as they were secretly investigating the rumor-monger, Cha, the director of the Jianxin Fire Brigade, received a phone call in the afternoon, saying that the Jianxin Fire Brigade had been destroyed. Cha knew that someone was spreading rumors, so he asked the company and learned that Yang, a child inside the East Gate, was playing with it. After negotiation, the telephone was dismantled to avoid future troubles.</p>

<p>Youth Aid Ma Corps Depart from Xiang for Kun At 12:00 a.m. on the 9th, more than 200 members of the Youth Aid Ma Corps walked from Zhenru, Jinnan University, along the Beijing-Shanghai Road to Nanxiang and stayed overnight at Nanxiang Central Elementary School. On the morning of the 10th, Zhang Shaojie, the head of the corps, arrived in Xiang from Shanghai and held a meeting of the members at the school. Hu Koufu, the training section chief, requested to resign. After being unanimously retained, he accepted the public's intention in tears and agreed to continue to work hard. Dozens of family members of the members came to Xiang to prevent them from going. The members all refused with painful words. Among them, a 14-year-old member had already signed up in Shanghai, but the corps rejected him because of his young age. On the 10th, he walked from Shanghai to Xiang to participate again. The corps still politely refused, so he turned his head and left without saying a word. Then the corps, because of his indignant attitude and fear of accidents, sent someone to follow him to the station and allowed him to join. The students of Nanxiang Central Elementary School were quite moved. They all donated food and bait to the corps. Wu Yaozhang, the director of the Wu County Education Bureau, came to Xiang on behalf of the entire county's education sector to welcome them. The corps set off on the morning of the 11th and walked to Kunshan. It was heard that they planned to stay in Kunshan for one night and continue walking to Suzhou.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Temporary Martial Law in the Provincial Capital The Zhejiang Provincial Government held a temporary meeting on the night of the 10th and decided to announce the implementation of temporary martial law, because the winter defense period was approaching, the situation was tense, and Hangzhou City was an important place in the provincial capital. They feared that villains would take the opportunity to steal and cause trouble. Xiaolao Chen, the bandit leader of Xiaofeng, was killed. Xiaolao Chen, the bandit leader of Xiaofeng, had committed numerous crimes and had been repeatedly pursued by the military and police without success. The other day, the Second Company of the Seventh Regiment stationed in Zhangcun reported that Xiaolao Chen led more than 20 bandits and was hiding in Nanwu Mountain, intending to rob. Zhang Wanyi, the company commander, immediately led the team to encircle and suppress them overnight. They encountered the bandits in Lingxia, and the two sides engaged in fierce gun battles. The bandit leader Xiaolao Chen and one other bandit were killed on the spot, and two bandits, Yang Laoer and Wen Yongxiang, were captured alive. Chen Guochen, a hostage, was rescued, and several rifles were seized. The remaining bandits escaped because it was dark at night and the mountain paths were rugged.

<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Unexpected Dispute in No. 6 Middle School All the students of Hefei No. 6 Middle School, in addition to organizing a propaganda team to publicize the atrocities of the Japanese army's continued occupation in the city, have now decided to go to the countryside to publicize to the farmers in order to spread it widely. But before they set off, Dong Jingbo suddenly held seven letters, with slogans attached such as "Stopping going to the countryside to propagandize is being a national slave" and "Dai Xizeng secretly stops the patriotic movement" (Dai is the principal) and sent them to the junior high school department, writing "Issued by the senior high school department." The middle and junior high school students were very surprised because Dai did not stop them. After inquiring about the senior high school, they learned that it was fabricated. So they sent Gao Jiahai, the doorman of the junior high school, to capture Dong Jingbo, the messenger, and sent him to the Public Security Bureau. He confessed that he was instructed by Cai Xiwu, a western doctor. Cai declared that he had nothing to do with this matter. Dai and Cai have now sued the court.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from the Business Department of Qishuyan Power Plant</h3>
<p>To the editor: In the Wuxi news of your newspaper on the 8th of this month, there was a report about our factory's recovery of electricity deposit, and there were many misunderstandings in the content. According to Article 2 of our factory's business regulations, all users must pay a deposit according to the size of the installed electric meter as a guarantee for electricity bills. Because our factory supplies electricity and only collects electricity bills one month later. Although it is not difficult to cut the wires and stop the electricity for those who do not pay on time, there are also those who move, those who close down, and those who burn down their houses and refuse to pay. The electricity bills that are already owed are often difficult to recover because the deposit was not paid in advance. Our factory has suffered huge losses because of this. Moreover, if electricity users use electricity up to several thousand yuan per month, the loss will be even greater if there is no deposit and they default on payment. Therefore, we have to seek remedies to ensure the guarantee. Checking and collecting electricity deposits is the same as paying a deposit for cabinets. (It is a common practice for power plants not to charge a deposit for cabinets. Our factory's users, who have handled it in accordance with the regulations, total more than 9,000 households, and there have been no different opinions. Those who have not paid in accordance with the regulations do not account for even one-tenth of the total, and the amount is only more than 10,000 yuan. This time, the demand for payment in accordance with the regulations was in accordance with Construction Committee Order No. 423, ordering the rectification as soon as possible to avoid losses. Some users who do not understand the truth expressed doubts, thinking that there was no such stipulation, which was a misunderstanding. We hereby send a letter to your newspaper about the reasons for our factory's recovery of electricity deposit this time and the handling of it in accordance with the order, in order to correct the hearing and dispel public doubts. Sincerely, Business Department of Qishuyan Power Plant</p>
<p>Important Education News</p>
<h3>After the Student Demonstrations in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>A general strike since yesterday ▲ Zhang Dao Resigns. The Hangzhou Municipal Student Union of Higher and Secondary Schools, citing the urgency of the national crisis, held a demonstration on the previous (10th) day and petitioned the Provincial Party Headquarters Zhang’s residence. Due to the unsatisfactory response, there were incidents of property damage, which was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that martial law has been declared in Sibu to strengthen defenses. Furthermore, members of the Provincial Government and Provincial Party Headquarters were invited to a meeting at the Provincial Government Conference Room at 9:00 PM to decide to temporarily prohibit student gatherings. It is reported that Zhang Daofan, unable to maintain the situation, has telegraphed the Central Government to resign.</p>
<p>It is reported that the presidents and principals of various colleges and schools in Hangzhou, upon hearing of the students' general strike, issued a notice to the students on the 11th, stating that a strike would be tantamount to a temporary interruption of the life of the school and should be considered carefully. It is imperative not to allow the nearly extinct education to be completely extinguished due to the actions of our schools themselves. However, students from various schools did not attend classes yesterday.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Student Union sent a telegram stating: "To be forwarded to all anti-Japanese associations across the country. During the anti-Japanese march and petition by students from various schools in Hangzhou, the Provincial Party Headquarters first undermined the national salvation movement and then used military and police force to suppress it. When minor conflicts occurred, Zhang Daofan, relying on the power of the Education Department, prohibited students from participating, willingly harming the country, which is truly regrettable. Details will be sent by mail. We earnestly request assistance and guidance from all sectors. The Hangzhou Student Union respectfully bows."</p>

<h3>The Jiangsu Department of Education Requests a Thorough Investigation of Educational Funds in Jiangdu County (II)</h3>
<p>As of the 19th year, the county's educational funds are in arrears of over 136,000 yuan, partly due to excessive spending and partly due to fraud in tax collection. According to a survey conducted in February of this year, the amount of education surtax and land tax that should have been collected but was not collected in the 16th, 17th, and 18th years totaled approximately 70,000 yuan. Even in the prosperous year of the 19th year, the amount that should have been collected but was not collected was still as high as over 110,000 yuan. Taking the 18th year as an example, the amount that had been strung together but not paid was 28,547 yuan, and the amount that had not been strung together but should have been paid was 27,994 yuan. The misappropriation of educational funds is undoubtedly confirmed by evidence. Moreover, the number of uncollected amounts that were not strung together each year is unknown. The people of the county are generally aware of such fraudulent practices, but because the strung-together households are all under false names and the fish-scale registers have all been lost, it has been difficult to track them down. The Department has dispatched personnel to the county in April and May of this year to discuss solutions with the county bureau regarding the repayment of arrears. In addition to urging the collection of surtax and land tax and allocating preparatory loans from various schools and museums, 60,000 yuan of educational bonds were issued, using a portion of the annual revenue from salt tax and land rent as collateral. Unexpectedly, just as the plan was finalized, the area was hit by a flood. Many of the bonds have not been sold, and the rejection slips have not been paid, so the old debts have not been repaid according to the planned schedule. The income from salt tax and land rent in the 20th year, amounting to over 60,000 yuan, has been used to secure the bonds. The Education Bureau used all the funds before the end of the year. The current expenses rely only on a small amount of tuition and the education surtax and land tax that should be collected this year. When the newly appointed Director Xian Qihuan took office in early October, all tuition fees were</p>
<p>discussed with the county government and finance bureau, and the collecting clerks were urged to pursue the funds for two months, but only over 2,000 yuan was paid. The Bureau Director's 7,000 yuan of expenses for two occasions were mostly made up of advances from the county government and finance bureau and temporary loans from various money shops by the Director himself. The Bureau Director must personally borrow to cover the bureau's expenses. The difficulty of the county's educational funds has reached an extreme. However, the finance bureau, which is responsible for unifying the county's finances, has delegated the responsibility for the education surtax and land tax that is collected along with the regular tax to the Education Bureau, making many excuses and refusing to take responsibility. This allows the collecting clerks to sell out their conscience even more. This is the general situation of the county's educational fund collection being exhausted, the finances being in dire straits, and the Department eagerly thinking of ways to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>Although collection malpractices are unavoidable in all counties, Jiangdu, Jiangning, Yixing, and Jiangyin are the worst in the province. Among these four counties, Jiangdu has the most extravagant educational spending. The revenue is like this, but the expenditure is like that. Therefore, the trend of teachers in Jiangdu demanding salaries and striking is worse than in other counties. Currently, the county's Education Bureau has been instructed to draft a corresponding plan regarding reducing expenditures. As for rectifying collections and eliminating long-standing malpractices, the head office is relatively tight and has a greater relationship. The proposed plan is to ask the government to select capable personnel to go to the county to thoroughly investigate and urge rectification to avoid failure and achieve quick results. All the difficulties of Jiangdu's educational funds and the proposed rectification methods are hereby reported in detail. Whether it is appropriate, please review, approve, and instruct for compliance. Respectfully submitted to Ye, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Chen Hexian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. (End)</p>

<h3>The Education Plan of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Appropriation of Funds for the Construction of New School Buildings</p>
<p>This Wednesday, the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, based on the discussion of the Education Committee, decided to allocate 11.992 mu of land from the former Victoria Infant Home on Bazi Road for the reconstruction of the Public Hanbilly Girls' School. The details of the Municipal Council's discussion on this matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to allocate at least 150,834 mu of land from the former Victoria Infant Home site to build a new Public Hanbilly Girls' School, at the Board of Directors meeting on the 9th of this month, a director stated that although a majority of the Education Committee members strongly supported this proposal, his personal opinion was that since the land price here is very high, the playground area should be reduced to a minimum. He noted that in other densely populated large cities, few schools have playgrounds attached to them. Such playgrounds are generally located in areas where land prices are lower. However, since the population here is dense, leaving a space of land is also very beneficial. Therefore, he would strongly support converting the remaining land of the school site into a small park.</p>
<p>In response to the Chairman's inquiry, the Chief Engineer stated that if the school is built according to the proposed Plan A, the school building would have to be close to the road. If a larger piece of land is used, it can be further away, but the noise problem can be mitigated by building a high wall along the road.</p>
<p>Another director mentioned that the decision to build a new school on this piece of land will incur huge expenses. He knew that the Municipal Council had already made a decision on this matter, but he had said in previous discussions that the education plan set by the Municipal Council may not be realized due to the huge amount of money it requires. This plan has been approved in principle by the taxpayers, but he still feels that although this policy can be carried out in the next few years, the taxpayers may suspect that the Municipal Council has endless funds to spend. Therefore, he believes that whenever a proposal to increase taxes is discussed, attention should be paid to the Municipal Council's financial position.</p>
<p>Another director suggested that costs could be saved if cheaper buildings were built. The Chief Engineer replied that he believed it would be more cost-effective in the long run to build first-class buildings. Regarding the construction of Chinese primary schools, the residences of staff and school workers have been eliminated, which has greatly reduced the cost. After further discussion, it was unanimously decided to allocate 11.992 mu of land, and the remaining land will be converted into a small park. (Shenshi News Agency)</p>

<h3>Two Notices from the Western Football Club</h3>
<p>The secretariat of the Western Football Club issued two notices last night: (1) Radio Broadcast of Football News (2) New Rules Regarding Football Players' Absolute Obedience to Referees. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Radio Broadcast of News</p>
<p>If the weather is unfavorable and it is not known in advance whether the match will be held, the Western Association has decided to use radio to broadcast news. At 12:45 PM, a brief but very clear announcement will be broadcast by the XCBL station in both Chinese and English. At the same time, other interesting and important news will also be broadcast at that time. Listeners should pay attention to the time and station name. The Western Association is still preparing other methods to transmit news. As for the results of football matches on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays, all or part of them will be broadcast in the evening. This has not yet been finalized and will be implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>New Rules on Absolute Obedience to Referees</p>
<p>In today's matches, players often question the referee about the reasons for their rulings, asking them to explain. It should be known that this right of players has become a thing of the past. Today, the British Football Association has cancelled this right. Shanghai is an affiliated association of the Association and naturally follows the new rules. The new rules clearly stipulate that players must not question the referee's decision and must obey absolutely. Players who argue with the referee or express dissatisfaction are acting illegally and must be warned. If they do so a second time, the referee may order them off the field. There are even clearer provisions as follows: Players must not only not express dissatisfaction with the referee in words or actions, but the referee should take immediate action when they find out (see the 1931-32 Football Rules Guide for Players).</p>
<h3>Today's China Football Association has one match</h3>
<p>Gaohao vs. Public Security Association 2 3:00 PM Athletics Field Zhang Yi</p>
<h3>Red Team Wins Western YMCA Basketball Last Night</h3>
<p>Result: 38 to 17</p>
<p>Haiqi wins Jiangwan Team 49 to 22</p>
<p>Chenxing wins Lakes 29 to 28</p>
<p>There were a total of three Western YMCA basketball matches last night. In the first match, Jiangwan was not as good as Haiqi, but it showed a balanced trend in the second half. In the second match, Chenxing and Lakes fought fiercely. In the last five minutes, Chenxing was full of spirit and caught up from behind, winning by one point. This is the effect of hard work. In the third match, it was not surprising that the Red Team won against the Daredevils. There were not many highlights in the whole game.</p>
<p>Haiqi wins Jiangwan (A): Pirei's single-arm shake caused Jiangwan's basket to fall. Haiqi continued to rise, eventually reaching sixteen points. Jiangwan, while trying to resist, waited for a chance to attack. When the opportunity came, Sun Huibei explored the basket to open the record. Cheng Mingjue replaced Wu Shijie and also took advantage of the gap to score three points. In addition, Zhuo Siqing also scored a goal, for a total of seven points. Haiqi's Squire returned home and was replaced by his brother. He was equally strong but lacked agility. With the wonderful coordination of the whole team, he still presented a lively state. In the first half, Haiqi took the lead with 30 to 11. At the beginning of the second half, the two sides held their ground firmly, and the chance to get the ball was equal. Jiangwan's Zhang Jinxiang and Xie Baochang defended effectively, and the losses were not many. After fighting for ten minutes, Jiangwan's arrogance slightly declined, but soon recovered. As a result, Jiangwan lost by 22 to 49. Referee: Qu Hongren.</p>
<p>(Up) 30/7 Haiqi (Down) 19/15 Jiangwan (Total) 49/22</p>
<p>Chenxing wins Lakes (B): Chenxing has commendable qualities. If they get good teachers to guide them, their future achievements will be amazing. Please do well for yourselves. Lakes completely relies on height and strength. Their skills are mediocre. In the first half, Lakes scored 19 points and Chenxing scored 7 points. In the midst of the battle, Chenxing proceeded smoothly, soaring upwards. The scores of the two sides gradually came closer, and the situation was extremely tense. This is because the two teams in Group B2 have not suffered any setbacks, and the victory or defeat is related to the future championship. Heaven does not fail people, and hard work will eventually bear good fruit. In the end, Chen Zuqiang actually defeated Lakes by 29 to 28. Referee: Bratt.</p>
<p>(Up) 7/19 Chenxing (Down) 22/8 Lakes (Total) 29/28</p>
<p>Red Team wins Daredevils (A): The Red Team opened the scoring, thanks to Xu Kepei. In the blink of an eye, the Daredevils Bennett Nipiru scored consecutive goals, chasing from behind. The Red Team continued to advance, with each having its ups and downs. Suddenly, Dong Yangfang, Xu Gaizhi, Dong Xiaopei, Yu Peien, Xu Kepei, etc. made consecutive achievements, and thus took the lead with 20 to 10 in the first half. At the beginning of the second half, the Daredevils scored a goal first, which seemed to be a turning point. Unexpectedly, the Red Team once again showed its power, continuing to advance fiercely. Qian Yaobin and others all scored points, and the Daredevils fell into an irredeemable environment. As a result, the Red Team won the Daredevils by a large margin of 38 to 17. Referee: Lu Zhongen.</p>
<p>(Up) 20/10 Red Team (Down) 18/7 Daredevils (Total) 38/17</p>
<h3>Results of Yesterday's Women's Basketball Match</h3>
<p>Jiangjiang wins Huaxia...39 to 4</p>
<p>Qiangdong wins Daxia...16 to 7</p>
<p>Jinan wins China...30 to 11</p>
<p>Three women's basketball matches were held in Shanghai yesterday, which were quite spirited. However, they were all one-sided, so the interest decreased, which was a bit unsatisfactory. The results were: (1) Jiangjiang wins Huaxia 39 to 4, (2) Qiangdong wins Daxia, 16 to 7, (3) Jinan wins China, 30 to 11.</p>
<p>Jiangjiang wins Huaxia (B): In the first half of this match, Jiangjiang scored 23 points, and Huaxia scored 4 points. In the second half, the momentum was entirely on Jiangjiang's side, and Huaxia was completely unable to make any achievements. As a result, Jiangjiang won by a large margin of 39 to 4.</p>
<p>Qiangdong wins Daxia (B): Qiangdong is a strong team in Group B and has high hopes of winning the championship. Daxia is also known for its good fighting ability, but in the first half, it was oppressed everywhere and unable to show its talent, losing by zero to twelve. Starting from the second half, Daxia suddenly became angry and showed great power. Qiangdong, at this point, was also difficult to do what it wanted. It is estimated that in the second half, Daxia actually had an advantage with 7 to 4. In the overall result, Qiangdong still won by 16 to 7.</p>
<p>Jinan wins China (A): Jinan in Group A is a veteran master with deep achievements. Although China tried hard to resist, it was not its enemy. In the first half, Jinan scored 19 points and China scored 4 points. In the overall result, Jinan won by 30 to 11.</p>
<h3>South Xiang Basketball Team's Five Consecutive Victories Over Xiang Guang</h3>
<p>On December 2nd, the South Xiang Xiang Guang basketball team accepted an invitation from the Shanghai White Eagle team for a friendly match at the public sports field at 2:00 PM. The result was 36 to 22, with Xiang Guang winning. On the 3rd, Xiang Guang defeated the Black team 44 to 18. On the 4th, Xiang Guang defeated Qing Guang 29 to 23. On the 5th, Xiang Guang defeated You Guang 63 to 15. On the 6th, Xiang Guang defeated White Crane 37 to 20. The Xiang Guang team members are Zhang Youlin, Han Wenbin, She Guodong, Ye Gongwang, Yin Bai, Chen Hongchao, Shen Xuemou, Shen Youyi, and Jin Dianding. The team welcomes letters inviting matches. Correspondence should be sent to the South Xiang Sports Field.</p>

<h3>Newspaper Association Held Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Party Department's Seizure of Newspapers</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Newspaper Association held an emergency meeting regarding the seizure of various newspapers. The resolutions were as follows: (1) Telegraph the National Government and the Central Party Department to stop the Shanghai Municipal Party Department from illegally seizing newspapers. (2) File a protest with the Municipal Party Department. (3) Send a letter to the Municipal Government requesting it to stop the seizure of newspapers. (4) Telegraph the Ministry of Communications requesting it to stop the post office from carrying out illegal orders. (5) Send a letter to the Postal Administration inquiring about the reason. (6) Issue a declaration that freedom of speech should not be subject to any inspection or interference. The letters and telegrams are recorded below (the declaration can be found before the current affairs commentary).</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central National Government, respectfully addressed to the Nanjing Central Party Department and National Government. This is to report that the Shanghai Municipal Party Department suddenly dispatched personnel to the Shanghai Post Office this morning to seize and prevent the dispatch of newspapers belonging to the Association, including Shen Bao, Xin Wen Bao, Shi Bao, Shishi Xin Bao, and Min Guo Ri Bao, to other locations. There was no prior notice and the action was abrupt. It is our belief that freedom of speech and publication within the bounds of the law is enshrined in the Provisional Constitution, which has been in effect for a long time. Shanghai newspapers have already been greatly constrained by censorship. Recently, during this time of national crisis, the Party and government authorities have repeatedly stated that public opinion should be open, which has been deeply welcomed by the people. Moreover, the Party Department is not an administrative body and cannot directly interfere. The Central Government has also already made a resolution on this matter. Yet the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, without knowing what basis it has, has suddenly seized newspapers at the post office, violating the Provisional Constitution and infringing upon business. Nothing could be more egregious. Therefore, we especially report this matter, respectfully hoping that your government and department will immediately order the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to stop the illegal behavior, so as to maintain the authority of the Provisional Constitution and protect freedom of speech. We would be deeply grateful. The Shanghai Newspaper Association respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>Protest to the Municipal Party Department. Respectfully informing you that this morning, Shen Bao, Xin Wen Bao, Shi Bao, Shishi Xin Bao, and Min Guo Ri Bao, belonging to our association, were sent to the post office as usual for dispatch to other locations, but were suddenly seized. We were also informed by the post office that this was done according to an official letter from your Party Department prohibiting dispatch. It is our understanding that freedom of speech and publication within the bounds of the law is enshrined in the Provisional Constitution, which has been in effect for a long time. This must be well known to your Party Department. Moreover, the regulation that the Party Department is not an administrative body and may not directly interfere with administrative matters has also already been passed by the Central Political Conference. At this time of national crisis, opening up speech has been especially and earnestly expressed by the Party and government authorities. The dissemination of newspapers is obvious to all. Yet your Party Department, without knowing on what authority or what law it is based, has suddenly sent a letter to the post office prohibiting the dispatch of newspapers. This is undoubtedly a violation of the Provisional Constitution, a suppression of speech, and an infringement upon business. In addition to separately requesting the Central Party Department and the National Government to stop this, we are especially lodging a protest with your Party Department. Your Party Department shall be responsible for all damages suffered by the various newspapers as a result. We hope you will take this into consideration and respond accordingly. Furthermore, in recent years, we have been greatly constrained by the inspection of newspapers. Now, the opening up of speech is the first step in saving the nation. This matter has already been resolved by our conference. From this day forward, we will no longer be subject to any inspection. We hereby declare this and hope you will take it into consideration. Respectfully addressed to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Government Requesting a Stop. Respectfully informing you that the Shanghai Municipal Party Department suddenly dispatched personnel to the Shanghai Post Office this morning to seize and prevent the dispatch of newspapers belonging to the Association, including Shen Bao, Xin Wen Bao, Shi Bao, Shishi Xin Bao, and Min Guo Ri Bao, to other locations. There was no prior notice and the action was abrupt. It is our belief that freedom of speech and publication within the bounds of the law is enshrined in the Provisional Constitution, which has been in effect for a long time. Shanghai newspapers have already been greatly constrained by censorship. Recently, during this time of national crisis, the Party and government authorities have repeatedly stated that public opinion should be open, which has been deeply welcomed by the people. Moreover, the Party Department is not an administrative body and cannot directly interfere. The Central Government has also already made a resolution on this matter. Yet the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, without knowing what basis it has, has suddenly seized newspapers at the post office, violating the Provisional Constitution and infringing upon business. Nothing could be more egregious. In addition to telegraphing the Central Party Department and the National Government, we respectfully send this letter, respectfully hoping that you will examine the matter and quickly put a stop to it. We would be publicly grateful. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Communications. Respectfully addressed to the Nanjing Ministry of Communications. This is to report that the Shanghai Municipal Party Department suddenly contacted the Shanghai Postal Administration this morning to detain our association's newspapers, including Shen Bao, Xin Wen Bao, Shi Bao, Shishi Xin Bao, and Min Guo Ri Bao, and forbade them from being sent outside. The Shanghai Post Office, without knowing on what basis, actually agreed to comply, causing all the newspapers to fail to be dispatched. It is our belief that freedom of speech and publication within the bounds of the law is enshrined in the Provisional Constitution. The Party Department is not a government agency. How can it issue orders regarding state-run public utilities? The post office serves society. How could it comply so readily without legal procedures? Now, at this time of national crisis, the opening up of speech has been repeatedly expressed by the Party and government authorities. Our association has already separately telegraphed the Central Party Department and the National Government to quickly stop this outrageous act by the Municipal Party Department. We especially telegraph your ministry again, requesting that you immediately instruct the post office to dispatch our association's newspapers as soon as possible in accordance with the law. We respectfully pray for your consideration. The Shanghai Newspaper Association respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>Letter to the Postal Administration. Respectfully informing you that the newspapers of our association submitted to your office for delivery on the 11th of this month were not delivered as requested. We were deeply puzzled. Later, we heard that your office was acting on the basis of a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department instructing you to detain the newspapers. This was even more surprising. According to the law, the people are granted freedom of speech and publication. Your office is an agency of a state-run public utility. How could you suddenly detain legally submitted mail? According to the law, the Party Department has no right to directly interfere. Moreover, our association's newspapers have not received any notice from the Party Department. Therefore, your office is truly responsible for the losses suffered by our association's newspapers as a result. We still hope to receive a clear reply regarding the truth of this newspaper seizure. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Postal Administration. (Note: The seized newspapers were released at noon after negotiations.)</p>
<h3>National Government Telegraphed Chen Mingshu to Thoroughly Investigate the Shanghai Student Movement</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Resolve to Resign is Firm</p>
<p>Although the National Government Sent a Telegram of Comfort and Retention</p>
<p>He Did Not Go to the Office Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the student movement of more than 5,000 people, which was caused by the assault on Peking University student Xu Xiucen and Chungshan University student Jiang Fangye, has calmed down since Mayor Zhang's reply the day before yesterday, which the students considered satisfactory. However, Mayor Zhang's resolve to resign is very firm. He did not go to the Municipal Government yesterday. However, the National Government has already approved a telegram of comfort and retention regarding Mayor Zhang's resignation. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed the National Government yesterday requesting retention. The following are the details of Mayor Zhang's determination to resign, the National Government's approval of retention, and the telegram to Chen Mingshu ordering a thorough investigation of the student movement.</p>
<p>National Government's Telegram of Comfort and Retention to Mayor Zhang. After Mayor Zhang telegraphed twice requesting resignation, the National Government's approval arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The approval roughly stated that the mayor has been in charge of Shanghai Municipality since he took office and his governance has been remarkable. Although major incidents have occurred repeatedly, he has been able to handle them properly and eliminate them invisibly. Now, at a time of national crisis, the Central Government is deeply relying on him. He must take on more difficult tasks to meet expectations. The request for resignation should not be discussed, etc.</p>
<p>The Civil Service Department Telegraphed Chen Mingshu. The National Government telegraphed Chen Mingshu yesterday, ordering a thorough investigation of the Shanghai student movement. The text read, "To Commander Chen Mingshu, Zhenru Xunjian, by order of the National Government: regarding the recent student actions in Shanghai and the authorities' handling of them, the rights and wrongs should be thoroughly investigated fairly by Chen Mingshu, Commander of the Garrison of the Peking-Shanghai area, so as to be reviewed and dealt with. This order is issued, please note and handle accordingly." Sincerely, the Civil Service Department of the National Government.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Requesting Retention. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying, "Respectfully addressed to the National Government: we were shocked to see in the newspapers that Mayor Zhang has requested to be relieved of his duties. Considering that Mayor Zhang's governance has been brilliant since he took office, and especially at this time of national crisis, we rely on his hard work to maintain stability. Please grant him comfort and retention, and encourage him to take on difficult tasks to reassure the public." The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>The Secretary-General is Acting in His Place. Mayor Zhang's resolve to resign is firm due to the difficulty of handling matters. He did not go to the Municipal Government yesterday. All mayoral duties are now temporarily being handled by Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, awaiting the Central Government to send personnel to take over.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Maintains Shanghai-Songhu Security</h3>
<p>Yesterday, He Personally Went to the Garrison Headquarters to Give Instructions</p>
<p>Ordering Subordinates to Pay Special Attention</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu, Commander of the Peking-Shanghai Garrison, went to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters in Longhua at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Xu Jinyuan, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, personally welcomed him. Chen gave instructions on everything in person, and because rumors have been rampant recently, and the security of Shanghai-Songhu is of great importance, he ordered his subordinates to pay special attention. Chen left at around 3:00 PM. Chief of Staff Xu immediately ordered all subordinates to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke's Important Remarks</h3>
<p>Hopes That Soldiers Will Voluntarily Rise Up Regarding the Northeast Provinces Issue</p>
<p>The Student Patriotic Movement is a Natural Thing</p>
<p>Yesterday, Guangdong representative Sun Zhesheng gave a speech to reporters from various news agencies regarding the issue of the Three Northeast Provinces, the student patriotic movement, and Mr. Wang's proposal to convene a National Salvation Conference. Reporter: (Question) What are your recent opinions on the issue of the Three Northeast Provinces? (Answer) The Three Northeast Provinces have been lost for several months, and Japan's aggression continues unabated. The Nanjing government has simply relied on the League of Nations and has no other way to deal with it. Under these circumstances, I believe that the only hope is that the soldiers throughout the country who have the courage will no longer ask their superiors about any non-resistance orders, and will voluntarily rise up, lead troops to the Three Northeast Provinces, consolidate national defense, and recover lost territory. Recently, Ma Zhanshan's desperate resistance and Zhang Fakui's offer to aid Heilongjiang are two of the best examples of soldiers. If there are soldiers willing to be Ma Zhanshan and Zhang Fakui, I believe that the people of the whole country will definitely assist them unanimously, and can give them great help in both spirit and material. Recently, the academic community in Guangzhou launched a fundraising campaign to aid Ma Zhanshan, and in just a few days, they raised more than one million yuan. The people's enthusiasm for saving the country can be seen from this. We should also know that to save the country, we must respect public opinion and cooperate with the people in a practical way in order to have a method and generate the greatest effect. (Question) What are your opinions on the recent student patriotic movement? (Answer) At this time when the country is facing an unprecedented crisis, it is natural for students to put aside their books and engage in a patriotic movement, because they are the more knowledgeable people in the country. If even they stand idly by at this time and turn a blind eye to national affairs, then is there still hope for China? In recent years, the people of the whole country have not dared to express anything in everything. People in society have become accustomed to this, and it is inevitable that they feel that this student patriotic movement is too rampant. In fact, the students' actions this time are exactly the kind of behavior that the people of a democratic country should have. Therefore, I believe that not only should students voluntarily rise up and do the work of saving the country, but also the people of other sectors should actively cooperate. Those who are already organized should strengthen their forces. Those whose organizations are not good should improve their organizations. Those who are not yet organized should hurry up and organize themselves. Only in this way can we pool our wisdom and efforts, and concentrate the strength of the people of the whole country to resist the invasion of the imperialists' guns, cannons, and warships. (Question) What are your opinions on Mr. Wang Jingwei's proposal to convene a National Salvation Conference? (Answer) Based on my conversation just now, I believe you must know that I completely agree with it.</p>
<h3>Central Government Replied to Wang with Telegram</h3>
<p>Wang is Resting for a Few Days Due to Illness</p>
<p>The Central Secretariat sent a special telegram to Wang Jingwei in Shanghai, and forwarded it to Messrs. Zhantang, Tiyun, Zhesheng, Youren, Junpei, and Haibin: "The barbarity of Japan is known to you. If we engage in direct negotiations before the Japanese army withdraws, we fear that it will become a disguised form of surrender. The Central Government has never taken this path. Chongguang came to Peking, but there were absolutely no negotiations with him. We are responding to your inquiry with this telegram. We hope you will take note."</p>
<p>Since Wang arrived in Shanghai on October 21, his liver disease broke out in less than ten days. However, because the peace conference was busy, he did not dare to mention his illness and continued to perform his duties as usual. However, while he was at his residence on Seymour Road, he consulted a Western doctor every day. After moving to his residence on Rue Bourgeat, he also took Chinese medicine. Visitors who called on him saw him handling affairs and taking medicine at the same time. This is a fact. However, both Western and Chinese doctors said that taking medicine in this way would not be effective. Wang has recently followed the doctor's advice and plans to rest for a few days. Except for specially appointed guests, he will generally decline to see visitors.</p>
<h3>Hong Weiji, a Student at the Art Academy, was Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>The French Police Suspected Him of Being a Communist</p>
<p>Released on Bail by the Municipal Government Last Night</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Higher Court is Scheduled to Hear the Case This Morning</p>
<p>Hong Weiji, a student at the Art Academy, is currently the director of general affairs of the school's Anti-Japanese Association and a judge of the Provisional People's Preliminary Court. At 1:00 AM this morning, he was suddenly arrested at his residence by French police detectives on suspicion of communism. Upon hearing the news, the Student Union went to the Municipal Government to petition for his release through negotiations with the French police. Yu Hongjun received them and immediately sent personnel to negotiate. He was released on bail by the Municipal Government at 9:30 PM last night. The Second Branch of the Higher Court is scheduled to hold a hearing at 10:00 AM this morning. The details of the incident are recorded below.</p>
<p>Hong Weiji Reported What Happened. After being released last night, Hong Weiji, who was arrested, reported what happened to reporters at the Art Academy. According to Hong, he lived on the second floor of the Cultural Elementary School in Wenderli, Beile Road, with another classmate. This classmate is currently on leave and has returned to his hometown. Because he had been petitioning at the Municipal Government all night and was overworked, he went to bed very early the night before. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 AM this morning, he vaguely heard many people loudly telling him to get up. When he woke up, he realized that they were five French police detectives, one of whom was a foreign police chief. They searched the house extensively, but found nothing. Finally, they suddenly found a small package on the table. After opening it, there were several leaflets of the Communist Party. The detectives said that you had committed a crime. He replied that he did not know where this thing came from. They did not allow him to explain and put the small package and all the incoming and outgoing letters into a briefcase, which was carried by a detective, and he was escorted to the Songshan Road Police Station. After asking his name, he was taken to the detention center. At 6:00 AM this morning (that is, yesterday morning), he was taken to the Lujiawan Police Station by the foreign police who bailed him out and interrogated in a small room. They said, "You are a Communist, why don't you confess?" He never admitted it. They asked, "Did this leaflet come from a classmate named Zhang?" He said, "No matter what you say, I will never admit it." Then he was taken back to the detention center. In the evening, he was released when his classmates came. One thing is most noteworthy, that is, when he left the police station, the police station asked, "Are you called Hong Yuanji?" He replied that since he was arrested, every time he was asked his name, he always answered with his real name, without any false words. The police station suddenly said that the name written on the ledger was wrong. The matter was very ridiculous, etc.</p>
<p>Students Petitioned the Municipal Government. After Hong Jun was arrested, the entire Art Academy was greatly indignant. They immediately convened a general meeting and sent representatives to report to the Student Union. The Union then sent one representative from each of the eight schools, including the Art Academy, Tongde, Aurora, Xinhua, Fudan, Merchant Marine, Telecommunications, and Jiaotong University, to the Municipal Government at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon to petition, making three points: (1) Please the Municipal Government negotiate with the French police to release the arrested Art Academy student. (2) Submit the Wang case court organized the day before yesterday to the Municipal Government for filing. (3) Guarantee the patriotic movement in the future. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Government replied (1) Since this matter was done by the French police, it is beyond the power of the Municipal Government, which can only send personnel to negotiate with your representatives. (2) The case of the court is to be submitted. Now the Central Government has sent Commander Chen to thoroughly investigate everything. We should wait quietly for the investigation and handling. (3) We will fully accept and forward a letter to the concession authorities to protect the patriotic movement.</p>
<p>The Twists and Turns of the Joint Negotiation. After Secretary-General Yu replied, regarding the first point of negotiating the release of the arrested student, the Municipal Government sent Secretary Geng Jiaji to meet with Student Union representative Xu Wenxi. (The Art Academy initially went to the French police to negotiate, but the police said that Hong was suspected of being a Communist and could not be released, so they returned without success. At about 5:00 PM, Secretary Geng again met with Student Union representative Chen Naigang, Art Academy Vice-President Tu Yuanbo, and Xu Tao, Xu Jinheng, and others to negotiate with the French police for the second time. However, the police said that the Hong case had been transferred to the Second Special District Local Court for handling, so they returned to report to the representatives. Then Xu Wenxi, Xu Jinheng, and Geng went to the Second Special District Court to inquire, but they all said that the case had not been transferred yet. So they returned to the French police and found the French Superintendent. Secretary Geng negotiated and was released on his personal guarantee.</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Higher Court Will Hold a Hearing This Morning. Regarding Hong Jun's case of suspected communism, he was temporarily released on bail yesterday. The Second Branch of the Higher Court is scheduled to hold a hearing at 10:00 AM this morning. The Student Union has already selected representatives from five schools, including the Law and Politics School, Aurora, Jiaotong University, and Traditional Chinese Medicine, to attend the hearing at that time, and has hired legal counsel. The Art Academy has also appointed representatives to attend the hearing.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Disturbances in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Precautions for Communist Memorial Day</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Communist Guangzhou Uprising. The Chinese and French police authorities in the city especially stepped up their defenses, and martial law was declared throughout the city. Except for streetcars passing through, one side of the iron gates at the border between the Chinese and French concessions was open to facilitate traffic, while the rest were all closed, leaving only side doors for entry and exit. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, more than 100 young men and women suddenly gathered at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Caishi Road in the French Concession. Each held red and white flags with the words "Anniversary of the Guangzhou Uprising" written on them, and shouted reactionary slogans along the way. Upon hearing the news, the French police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to drive them away. These people then swarmed eastward into the Chinese territory, heading north along Fangxie Road. There happened to be a Yanlingtang Chinese medicine shop there, which opened yesterday. Two Party-state flags were hanging at the entrance. These people immediately rushed forward, took down the flags, tore them into shreds, and used stones to smash the glass in the shop, destroying as many as nine panes. Along the way, they also intercepted two cars and five panes of glass in tram No. 36 of the French company Route 6, and three panes of glass in trolleybus No. 262 of the Public Concession Route 17. Finally, they swarmed to the entrance of the Municipal Party Department. Because the main gate was tightly closed after being destroyed the day before yesterday, they could not enter. With a loud shout, a hail of stones fell, and many panes of glass were destroyed. Fortunately, the Second District General Office was nearby, and they immediately ordered a large number of armed police officers to rush there. They only saw red and white reactionary flags and broken bricks and stones scattered everywhere, and many busybodies followed these people, gathering more and more people along the way. Director Ling was deeply afraid of causing trouble, so he first stopped passersby from following. As a result, one man and one woman were intercepted. The man confessed his name as Yang Yisan (18 years old from Anhui), and the woman confessed her name as Zhang Shumei (16 years old from Hubei). After interrogation, a document was immediately prepared and submitted to the Judicial Section for verification and decision. Yesterday, the Great World Amusement</p>

<p>Park was temporarily closed during the day due to martial law. It was not until 8:20 PM in the evening that it opened its doors to sell tickets. Nanshi, Zhabei, and the Public Concession in the Chinese territory were all under strict guard yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Delay of Newspapers Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Statements from the Postal and Telegraph Workers' Unions</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a delay of several hours in the dispatch of newspapers. According to the Postal and Telegraph Workers' Unions yesterday, the Municipal Party Department sent personnel with a letter to the residence of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Postmaster General yesterday morning, requesting the detention of local and foreign newspapers. The Postmaster General said that he had no authority to handle this matter and refused to accept it, and asked the personnel to transfer the request to the inspector at the inspection office of the bureau. The inspector asked his superiors for instructions, which caused delays for several hours. The two unions received the news and immediately urged the bureau to quickly dispatch the newspapers, so the detention was not long.</p>
<h3>Zheng Hongnian and Others' Statement</h3>
<p>Zheng Hongnian and others issued a statement yesterday saying, "Since the Japanese invasion of the Northeast Provinces, the whole country has been shocked. The government initially had no position on this matter and entrusted it all to the League of Nations, waiting for a solution. Then, after months of planning, in addition to adhering to the policy of non-resistance, there was still no solution. Recently, the news of demilitarizing Jinzhou and the joint administration of Tianjin has caused panic throughout the country. The young students, especially those with blood and courage, have acted out of desperation, which is seen by the people of the whole country. Unexpectedly, the government authorities regard the students' enthusiasm for saving the country as out-of-bounds behavior, saying that they are being used by others to disrupt the government. They have secretly arrested several people, including Hongnian, believing that the actions of students in Shanghai are directed by Hongnian and others. If so, then the students in Beiping, Jinan, Qingdao, and Suzhou-Hangzhou have all gone to Peking to petition, and other places have also expressed unanimous support. Who else are they being directed by? The students' sincere patriotism this time is very enthusiastic, which shows that the people's spirit is being promoted, thanks to effective education. Hongnian and others dare to take comfort in this. If you want to impose pressure and order the students not to engage in patriotic behavior, then the public will be indignant, based on their conscience, which is not something that individuals can suppress. Why would the authorities blame us for this and secretly issue an arrest warrant? The slander against Hongnian and others personally is insignificant, but the insult to the pure patriotic youth movement is too great. As for the government's measures, their past performance speaks for itself, and Hongnian and others do not want to say much. This is our humble opinion, and we hope the public will see it clearly." Zheng Hongnian, Li Minghuan, He Shizhen, Chen Qun.</p>

<p>Assembly Statement: Yesterday, a newspaper reported that Wang Huosheng's confession stated "beat first, then confess," which is not accurate. The provisional court was responsible for maintaining order by the bailiffs, and there was no coercion. The criminal's confession was entirely voluntary. Secondly, after the students of Peking University were released, they stated that the Public Security Bureau detained them on the orders of the Party Department. Also, Mayor Zhang's conversation stated that the Public Security Bureau deceived the superiors and cooperated with other agencies, resulting in a regrettable fact. Yesterday's newspapers omitted this information.</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of Yu Qiaqing and Others' Talks in Beijing</h3>
<p>Each person asked five questions</p>
<p>Song, Dai, and Gu all replied</p>
<p>Dai Jitao and Song Ziwen, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Special Diplomatic Committee of the National Government, telegraphed on the 9th, inviting Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Renzhi, Mu Ouchu, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Zhuping, Wang Boqi, Wang Yunwu, Xu Jiying, Ye Huijun, Shen Xinqing (Shen Benqiang representing Liu Zhanen), Dong Guang, Wang Yansong, He Shizhen (Lao Kengxiu representing), Yang Youren, Zheng Hongnian (Tang Demin representing), Hu Shuhua, Qian Cangshuo, and Wang Jingqi to Beijing to report on diplomatic issues and hold open discussions. As reported yesterday, Chen Bulei first reported on the student unrest and the Central Government's response policy at the Central Party Headquarters that morning, hoping that all sectors would work together to eliminate the unrest, trust the government, and unite against foreign aggression. At this point, Dai and Song, as well as Gu Huijun, Yu Youren, and others, attended. Dai first explained the nature of the Special Diplomatic Committee and the process of dealing with Japan diplomatically. It was past noon, so a discussion meeting was held at the Lishi Society after lunch. The questions and answers are recorded below. Regarding each person's questions: (1) The student unrest issue, regardless of whether the internal affairs of the students are complicated, its motives are born from patriotic enthusiasm. Diplomacy has reached such an urgent point, if young people show no reaction, what use is this kind of dead education to the country? Among the students of various universities in Shanghai, there are those who felt obligated to the country and spat blood, and there are students who ate vegetarian food to express their sorrow and hardship, which shows their sincere performance. Not only young students are like this, but also the elderly, such as Mr. Ma Xiangbo, ninety-two years old, told us personally, "I am old and cannot run around. Gentlemen are young, how can you sit idly by?" There is also Mr. Zhao Zhujun, seventy-five years old, a senior figure in the political world, who made great contributions to the establishment of the Republic of China, and has not asked about politics for many years. He is also very angry, so there is the organization of the Jiangsu Provincial National Disaster Relief Association, which shows that this diplomatic issue, regardless of men, women, and children, is unanimously indignant. However, young people are impulsive and their actions are particularly intense. Fortunately, the gentlemen who are dealing with the student unrest now have all participated in the student unrest before, and naturally understand the psychology of young people. There is one more thing that needs to be reported. When the Peking University demonstration group arrived in Beijing the other day, the Shanghai newspapers truthfully published news about this matter. Unexpectedly, a certain newspaper had a blank space deleted by the inspector. Therefore, it was rumored in Shanghai that the government had killed five students, but this was not the case. Then, is the purpose of the inspection to reduce the people's alarm, but the degree of alarm exceeds the facts? Why not abolish the inspection? (2) Diplomatic policy, the root of the student unrest is in diplomacy. Many people among the diplomatic colleagues were summoned to Beijing on November 8th to hear Chairman Chiang's questions. If the Japanese side expands and disturbs along the river and coast, what should be done? (Answer) Of course, we will resist. (Question) Is there adequate preparation for resistance? (Answer) Of course, there are preparations. We deeply believe that the Central Government's established policy will not be easily realized. But why are there things like the Jinzhou Neutral Zone and Tianjin co-management? It is also rumored that the government will sign an agreement, so the people are panicked, thinking that if Jinzhou is neutral, then the land of the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang will be given away? Tianjin was taken and it was proposed to co-manage it. If Nanjing is attacked, it is also proposed to co-manage Nanjing? It is also heard that the proposal for Tianjin co-management was initiated by Deputy Commander Zhang, which is even more shocking. What is the truth? It should be explained. (3) Between the withdrawal of troops and the suppression of bandits, the League of Nations twice ordered Japan to withdraw its troops, but Japan did not comply. This time, the League of Nations put forward investigation methods to appease Japan, hoping to replace the previous withdrawal resolution with this. We recognize that the investigation team is another matter, and the original withdrawal resolution should not be affected by it. It is heard that the government no longer insists on the deadline for the withdrawal of troops, and the people are very dissatisfied with this. If the withdrawal of troops can not be implemented, then the results of the investigation team in the future will be unfavorable to Japan, and it can not be implemented? It is heard that the Japanese are also asking for the right to suppress bandits. We believe that it hinders our country's sovereignty and causes great harm. If it is recognized, it is tantamount to giving up the demand for the withdrawal of troops. How does the government advocate this? (4) Economic blockade issues, according to Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, cutting off commercial relations and prohibiting people from coming and going is the natural procedure for dealing with those who engage in war without complying with the Covenant. Why has our country not heard of a proposal? What kind of obstacles have delayed the proposal? (5) The root of internal affairs and diplomacy issues lies in internal affairs. Mr. Dai said just now that he hopes to promote national diplomacy. Originally, in all countries, the government handles diplomacy, and it is not the final responsible person. The government is like the board of directors of a company, the president of the Executive Yuan is like the chairman and general manager of the board of directors, and the people are shareholders. Now there is a board of directors but no shareholders' meeting. No wonder the government feels the difficulty of dealing with diplomacy. What's more, the corruption of politics and the suffering of the people in recent years are too numerous to mention. If the government does not thoroughly reform, change the organization, publicize politics, and concentrate talents, and wants to seek the victory of diplomacy and the trust of the people, how can it be obtained? The government's response: (Song) The government's position really has various difficulties, but if the enemy comes to attack, no matter what, it must be defended. Without reaching the goal of withdrawing troops, it will never directly negotiate. As a result of the negotiation, it will never accept treaties similar to the Twenty-One Demands. The Tianjin incident is actually the Jinzhou incident. We are of course jointly responsible. The Jinzhou Neutral Zone is a mistranslation. In fact, it is a buffer zone. The League of Nations asked China and Japan to avoid military conflicts. Japan is accumulating strength to attack. The government asked the League of Nations to send personnel to inspect and show who is attacking. The truth is like this. At first, Japan advocated direct negotiations with the Northeast. Our country opposed it and it has now been cancelled. The Central Political Conference has passed the National Crisis Conference today. We are very willing to make everything public and hope that all sectors will understand the difficulties of the government. (Gu) The dissatisfaction of all parties with diplomacy is actually due to not understanding the truth. At the first meeting of Chongguang in Beijing, he asked the Chinese army to withdraw from Jinzhou. I replied that I could not do it. He asked if there was room for consideration. I replied that I had to ask the government. Chongguang therefore had a second meeting and still did not agree. The signing of the agreement, not only has it not been signed in these few days, but also in the future, we should uphold the purpose of protecting sovereignty, please rest assured. The issue of suppressing bandits is of great importance. As a result of our country's efforts, the draft resolution does not contain the word "suppress bandits." As for the issue of Article 16 of the Covenant, since this case occurred, the government has studied this point and has telegraphed representative Shi to contact other countries first. The countries have not agreed, because the nature of this article is to declare war one step further. All countries are very cautious. Even if our country implements this article alone, it has to be especially cautious. (Dai) In short, Japan will not withdraw its troops completely, and we will never directly negotiate. If there is another invasion, we will definitely resist. The government has decided to preserve territorial sovereignty, administrative integrity (New Voice Society)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Measures for Exporting Cash</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Notice to the Shanghai Banking Association</p>
<p>The Municipal Banking Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance saying: Shanghai Banking Association for review. According to a telegram from the Jianghai Customs Superintendent, Chinese and Western merchants in Shanghai are competing to transport silver dollars to ports such as Dalian and Qingdao, leading to a shortage of silver in Shanghai, which has caused concern in the financial community. We request instructions on how to address this issue. Currency originally values circulation, and finance emphasizes activity. The prosperity and decline of the market varies at different times, and the urgency of demand for cash varies. It is natural for merchants in various ports to transport and supply each other's markets. In recent days, most of the cash exports from Shanghai merchants are due to the commercial demand for cash in the north during the winter. The shortage of silver in Shanghai mentioned in the original telegram should be a temporary phenomenon. If we suddenly issue an order to ban exports, it would not conform to the principle of currency circulation and may harm the commerce of other ports. If there are unscrupulous merchants who intend to profit and cause financial panic in the local area by exporting cash, the Association should conduct strict investigations at any time and report to the Ministry for investigation and prohibition to maintain the market. In addition to sending telegrams to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Money Shop Association, we hereby send this telegram for compliance and implementation. Printed seal of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Lu Jingshi of the Municipal Executive Committee Telegraphed to Resign</h3>
<p>Lu Jingshi, an alternate member of the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, telegraphed the Central Government yesterday to resign. The telegram said: Urgent, Nanjing Central Party Department Executive Committee for your review. Jingshi has taken on the position of alternate member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department Executive Committee, and he has always felt that his talent is inadequate and his responsibility is heavy, and he is always worried about failure. At this time of national crisis, he deeply feels that he has failed to fulfill his duties in the Party's affairs, and he is very ashamed and fearful. Therefore, he is telegraphing to request permission to resign from the position of alternate member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department Executive Committee. However, Jingshi's patriotic enthusiasm is no less than others. From now on, he should still use his qualifications as a Party member to strive to fulfill his duties as a citizen. At the end of the telegram, he cannot help but wait for orders in trepidation. Respectfully, Lu Jingshi.</p>
<h3>Du Xigui Returned to Fujian Yesterday</h3>
<p>Du Xigui, Admiral of the Navy and Principal of the Mawei Naval Academy, came to Shanghai a month ago to discuss plans and methods for reorganizing the school with the Navy Department. The plans have been approved by the Navy Department, and a portion of the funding has been received. Du is leaving Fujian for a long time, and school affairs are in urgent need of reorganization, so he took the Huaan Wheel of the Chang'an Company back to Fujian at 3:15 PM yesterday. In advance, the Jiangnan Shipyard specially dispatched a small steamer to pick him up at the Dada Pier (because the wheel was moored at the No. 3 pontoon in the Pujiang River at the Dada Pier). Chen Jiliang, Commander of the First Fleet of the Navy, Chen Zaofan, Deputy Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, Ye Baoqi, Battalion Commander of the Navy Guard, and others all saw him off at the pier. Huang, a colonel staff officer of the Navy Department, and Secretary Lin, and seven or eight other followers accompanied Du.</p>

<h3>The Xinming Wheel Carrying Overseas Chinese Returning Home Will Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Decides on Settlement Measures</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Orders the Office to Receive</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau, upon the order of the Ministry of Communications, selected the Xinming Wheel to go to Japan on the 30th of last month to carry overseas Chinese back to their home country. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau will go to the pier to take care of them. The various situations are recorded above.</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Today: The Xinming Wheel arrived in Yokohama to pick up the returning diaspora. Later, because there were still overseas Chinese waiting in Kobe, it transferred to Kobe. A total of more than 1,400 compatriots were picked up from the two places, with the most from Quzhou and Taizhou in Zhejiang, followed by Guangdong and Jiangsu. It left Kobe at 2:00 PM on the 9th to return to the country. Yesterday morning, Guo, a commissioner from the China Merchants Bureau, received a wireless telegram from the Xinming Wheel informing that it would arrive at Wusongkou at 12:00 PM today, and would arrive at the Jinliyuan Pier in the French Concession at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Receive: The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was ordered to send personnel to receive the returning overseas Chinese when they returned home. It was decided that personnel would be sent to the Jinliyuan Pier at 1:00 PM this afternoon to receive the returning overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Department Will Operate as Usual Today</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Party Department was vandalized at 6:00 PM on the 9th, it announced that it would be closed for the past two days due to unfinished internal reorganization. It is heard that the Municipal Party Department has published an announcement in the newspaper that it will operate as usual from today onwards.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Department Telegraphs</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department telegraphed yesterday: National thoughts, Nanjing Central Party Department, all provincial and municipal Party departments, confidentially, the Pan Incident occurred, and the whole country is indignant. Anti-Japanese national salvation is in everyone's heart. This association leads the Shanghai citizens to work hard and do their best. How dare it be behind others? It supports and cherishes the patriotic movement of young students even more than usual. However, when people's groups hold meetings, the Party Department should guide them, but a few radical members of the Student Federation, because they resent the Party Department for correcting their proposals, want to spread rumors and slander to harm the association's guiding Comrade Baichuan, who is based in the government's Student Federation. On the 9th of this month, a certain Xu, who claimed to be a representative of the Peking University student demonstration group, and a certain Jiang, a representative of Zhongda, attended the church meeting of the Student Federation and fabricated a report. At that time, Comrade Tao had already left the meeting due to other matters, so he made excessive remarks, sang loudly to overthrow the government, the proletariat, and seize power, which led to the excitement of the audience, who were indignant. An unfortunate event of fighting occurred in front of the gate where a young man spoke. The beginning of this matter has nothing to do with Comrade Tao and this association. However, some students mistakenly believed the rumors of radical elements and vented their anger on the Party Department at 7:00 PM on the same afternoon. The Communist bandits led two or three hundred students and suddenly came to the Party Department, wantonly vandalizing it, and coercing five or six thousand students from various schools to rush to the Municipal Government and surround the mayor. After sixteen or seventeen hours, they coerced the mayor to do all kinds of illegal and ultra vires things, and beforehand, they occupied the telegraph room and telephone room to cut off the Municipal Government's communication with the outside world. Mayor Zhang was under the threat of violence, and what did he not want to do? At the same time, the Zhenru track of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was publicly destroyed by students of Jidai University, and worker Wang of the arsenal was forced to point out that he was the murderer who beat the students after being forced to confess. The courtyard of the Municipal Government was actually the trial ground of the people. This kind of behavior is undoubtedly instigated by a few red bandits. However, the students were deeply afraid that the news would spread and the truth would be revealed, so from the evening of the 9th, they sent two or thirty violent students or hooligans to the major newspapers in Shanghai every day to force them to publish the news. The Republic of China Daily did not obey, so they threatened to vandalize it, so that the truth was buried and the whole country was obscured. Thinking about this kind of situation, what kind of law and discipline is there? Moreover, the disturbances of students in various places and the destruction of the Party Departments of Beijing and Zhejiang Province and City show that the Communist bandits' instigation of students to violate the law and cause disturbances has a detailed plan. The matter concerns the safety of the Party and the country, not only this city and this association. Now, the comrades of this association, in addition to adhering to their original intentions and working hard, also stated the important conversations in the Shanghai Republic of China Daily on the 11th to clarify the truth. For the following points, we should ask the Central Committee to approve them. (1) Order the Shanghai Municipal Government to declare that the logic of arresting Comrade Tao Weiyuan Baichuan and Comrade Chen Xizeng is out of coercion and does not take effect. (2) Order the military and civilian chiefs in various places to be responsible for severely punishing the red bandits and taking the students' out-of-bounds actions. (3) Send one or two members of the Central Committee to Shanghai as soon as possible to be responsible for hosting the anti-reactionary affairs. (4) Order the chiefs in various places to be responsible for protecting the premises of the Party Department. (5) Order the Party departments at all levels to transfer to the comrades across the country that they should step up their work, fight for the Party, and resist insults to the country. Those who slander this Party, insult the Premier, and despise the ideology of our Party should be regarded as aliens and resist them. They must not shake their beliefs and destroy the front line. The above five points should be adopted and implemented by the Central Committee so that the comrades can do their best in their final efforts. Otherwise, retreating from the battle and trying to betray will inevitably lead to the destruction of the Party. Violating the law and disrupting discipline can be infringed, and will inevitably lead to the destruction of the country. What is said in the heart is dangerous, and the tears are dripping and the truth is told. Please observe the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City Executive Committee,</p>
<h3>New Swiss Consul General Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>A Rickshaw Puller Shot Dead Amid Curfew</h3>
<p>Two Coolies Also Wounded</p>
<p>Curfew Area Not Allowed to Pass</p>
<p>Yesterday at dawn, a number of pedestrians were walking through the intersection of Datong Road and Taiyangmiao Road in Zhabei, intending to pass through. Because it was during curfew, they were stopped by soldiers of the Tax Police Corps. However, this group of pedestrians were all ignorant farmers and coolies who did not understand the stakes. They still wanted to move forward, and the soldiers immediately opened fire, killing one person and wounding two others. The crowd was shocked and fled in panic. Residents in the vicinity were also extremely frightened and uneasy all day long.</p>
<p>Soldiers Opened Fire: Datong Road and Taiyangmiao Road are the main roads in Zhabei, especially north of the railway. Every day at dawn, there are even more pedestrians coming and going. Farmers, vegetable vendors, etc. from Dachang and Zhenru all carry baskets and burdens to enter the city to sell their wares, and they all take this road. In addition, there are also general coolie classes of Jiangbei residents who live in the suburbs and walk here to work north pulling carts. Therefore, there are many pedestrians on the road. At about 5:15 AM yesterday morning, dozens of pedestrians came one after another from various main roads such as Datong Road, Hutai Road, and Zhongxing Road from the south towards the Taiyangmiao Railway. At that time, two sentries from the Third Battalion of the First Regiment of the Tax Police Corps stationed there stopped the crowd from walking forward, but those who came later still gradually poured up, which caused a lot of people to talk at once and the order was in chaos. The soldiers fired two shots, killing one rickshaw puller and two coolies. The soldier who fired the shots was Yi Mingde.</p>
<p>One Dead and Two Wounded: The deceased, Shen Dasheng, lived by pulling carts. The wounded, Zhang Bolin and Xu Fubao, were small rickshaw pullers. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, the court sent Prosecutor Wu to the scene to examine the body. After examining it, it was determined that Shen Dasheng was indeed shot to death. The local guarantor was instructed to collect the body for burial. The deceased was thirty-five years old, from Funing, and lived at 1043 Zhonghua Xin Road. He left behind his wife, Chen, and a six-year-old daughter, Guihong. According to Chen, her husband used to make a living by pulling carts. At the time of the incident, he had just gone out to pull the early shift, but he unexpectedly died tragically. The whole family would have no way to make a living from now on. The two wounded were sent to Pushan Hospital by the Fourth District Police Station. Zhang Bolin was thirty-one years old and lived at 109 Hutai Road. Xu Fubao was twenty-eight years old and lived at 39 behind the Yangzhou Guild Hall, making a living by pushing carts. It was heard that when the soldiers opened fire, the first shot was fired into the sky, and the second shot was fired horizontally into the crowd. Therefore, the deceased was fatally wounded in the chest, and the two wounded had one bullet enter through the mouth and the other enter through the shoulder.</p>
<h3>Ni Bianzui Died Innocently, Coroner Examined</h3>
<p>Garrison Police Raised Gun, Bullet Flew Out</p>
<p>Ni Bianzui Died of Serious Injuries Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Wang Juan, a patrolman at the Sixth Garrison of Meijialong in the Third Sub-station of the First District in the city, at 8:00 PM on the 9th, when stationed at the garrison, saw a person in black clothes passing by and scurrying into the alley. When he shouted, there was no response. When he raised his gun, the bullet went off and hit the head of rickshaw puller Ni Shaoqi, also known as Ni Bianzui (51 years old, from Haimen), who fell to the ground in pain. The police sent Ni to the station and immediately sent him to Shanghai Hospital. He died yesterday morning. Qin Defang, the 23rd Pudi Jia, reported to the local court for an examination. Prosecutor Wu and others came to the scene and confirmed that he had died from his injuries. The family members were instructed to collect the body for examination pending verification.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of Seven Deaths by Drowning in a Capsized Ferry Due to a Racing Sunken Wheel</h3>
<p>No Rescue Attempt Made After the Accident</p>
<p>The Ferry Disappeared and Drifted Away</p>
<p>Wang Xuegui from Shandong made a living by rowing a small boat numbered 872. Recently, due to his old age, he entrusted the work to his son, Lao Kong, and nephew, Lin Xiaoliao. They ferried passengers daily between the Taitong Wharf in Pudong and the Zhaofeng Wharf in Puxi to earn a living. Yesterday morning, around 6 a.m., a dozen female workers from the Nanyang Tobacco Company in Hongkou were about to start their shift. Near the Taitong Wharf in Pudong, they boarded Wang Laokong's boat to cross the river to work at the factory. While rowing near the No. 4 buoy in the middle of the river, a Japanese merchant ship, the "Yibae Maru," was maneuvering to turn around and head out to sea. Wang's boat approached the stern of the ship, and the Japanese ship deliberately started its engine. A huge wave suddenly arose, and Wang's boat was directly hit and immediately capsized by the violent waves. After causing the accident, the Japanese ship did not stop to rescue anyone but sped up and headed out to sea. Nearby Chinese boats rushed to the rescue, saving six or seven female workers on the spot. However, several female workers and the two boatmen, Zhou Laokong and Lin Xiaoliao, uncle and nephew, drowned. The boat also drifted away due to the strong tide. The Yangshupu Water Police Station learned of the incident and dispatched Detective Hu Changqing and Chinese Constable No. 52 to investigate. They brought Lao Kong's father, Xuegui, to the police station to inquire about the situation and await further instructions. It is now confirmed that five female workers died, including one named Yao Linmei, 15 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 3 Wujia Listening in Pudong. Her father, Yao Zhanghai, received the shocking news and came to the police station to request attention to his daughter's body. The families of the other four female workers have not yet come forward to identify them, so their names, ages, and origins are difficult to ascertain. Their bodies have not yet surfaced. Investigations revealed that personnel are usually stationed fore and aft before a ship sets sail to observe and ensure there is no danger before starting the engine. The ship, having seen a small boat behind it, suddenly rang the bell and started its engine, causing the deaths of seven boatmen and passengers. This is extremely heinous. It is unknown how this case will be resolved.</p>

Those who violate the aforementioned item (2) will have their directors or managers prosecuted by the Director-General of Police and the Bureau of Guarantees in the competent court, and their newspaper office or distribution point may also be closed by the French Consul General.

If necessary, the printer will also be prosecuted.</p>

The entire nation is deeply indignant. All members of our union, being forced to do so, have no choice but to telegraph again, earnestly requesting your government to dispatch troops within a specified time to eliminate the enemy's influence.

<h3>He Xiangning Organizes a Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition to Aid National Crisis</h3>
<p>Declaration Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>Declaration of He Xiangning's Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition to Aid the National Crisis: Liao Zhongkai sacrificed his life for opposing imperialism and seeking China's freedom and equality. I, He Xiangning, though untalented, continue his legacy by founding the Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering in Guangzhou, thinking to establish a foundation for the liberation of the working masses. However, funds are exhausted, and the scale is narrow, failing to fully expand the responsibility. Various matters are forced by circumstances and contrary to my wishes, which I often deeply regret. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, Shanghai calligraphers and painters generously supported and donated some pieces of calligraphy and painting, and I planned to sell them publicly to raise funds for the university. However, due to my frequent travels in Europe over the years, I have not had time. Recently, the Northeast Incident occurred, and in the blink of an eye, two months have passed. Japanese imperialists attacked our Liaoning and Jilin, occupied our Heilongjiang, and disturbed our Tianjin and Qingdao. Warships are spread across key areas, and vagrants run rampant in the cities. If we do not resist this, how can we survive? Hearing the alarm from the seacoast, I, He Xiangning, return from thousands of miles away. In this time of national crisis, how dare I forget the lesson that every common man has a responsibility? Weighing the urgency, I transfer my thoughts: Establishing a school can be delayed, but saving the country cannot be postponed. Therefore, I plan to hold an exhibition of the accumulated calligraphy and painting of contemporary masters, as well as my personal paintings over the years, and sell them all at marked prices. The proceeds will be used for anti-Japanese and war relief work. I hope that art enthusiasts and generous heroes will understand my humble intentions, offer their enthusiastic support, generously donate calligraphy and painting, or widely purchase paintings and calligraphy. By gathering small contributions, it will be easy to lift a heavy object together. Perhaps we can stop the setting sun and fill the vast ocean with the stones of the Jingwei bird. I would be most fortunate. This is my declaration. The matter of Ms. He Xiangning initiating a painting and calligraphy exhibition to aid the national crisis has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that since the preparation of the exhibition, everything has been in order. Yesterday, the ticket sales department of the association held a meeting, attended by Liu Yazi, Zheng Hongnian, Ye Yuhu, He Xiangning, Lin Gengbai, He Pinquan, Wang Xiaoying, Zhang Hongwei, Tang Guanyu, Bao Zhen, Zheng Manqing, Chu Minyi, Wang Ruizhu, Zhu Shaoping, Zhu Hongjie, Guan Hanguang, Wang Yiting, and others, more than ten people in total. Two hundred tickets were sold on the spot, totaling 6,000 yuan. Combined with the 3,000 yuan donated by Chen Mingshu and Fan Qiwu the other day, the total is nearly 10,000 yuan. It is heard that many people from all walks of life are contacting and purchasing tickets.</p>
<h3>Chen Yafei Resigns from Volunteer Army Position</h3>
<p>China News Agency reports that Chen Yafei, chairman of the Volunteer Army Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and chief of staff of the army, recently resigned from his positions as committee member and chief of staff of the army due to the overwhelming amount of affairs, making it difficult to manage both the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the Volunteer Army at the same time. It is reported that Chen will no longer be responsible for the affairs of the city's Volunteer Army.</p>
<h3>Liu Dajun to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive on the 18th</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Dajun, representative of the National Government to the International Statistical Conference held in The Hague and Madrid, traveled to Europe in early August via the Siberian Railway to attend the conference and study the statistical undertakings of various countries.

<h3>News of Donations to Support Ma</h3>
<p>The Citizens' First District Branch Continues to Remit 1,000 Yuan The Shanghai Citizens' First District Branch previously remitted 1,000 yuan from the Bank of China to support Chairman Ma's troops in Heilongjiang Province. At the same time, it specifically established agencies for fundraising and remittance at Sincere and Wing On department stores to collect donations from all walks of life. As of yesterday, a total of 1,050.33 yuan has been received and fully transferred to the Bank of China for continued remittance to Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>The Shipbuilding Industry Union of the Fifth District Donates More Than 300 Yuan At the 15th joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Shipbuilding Industry Union of the Fifth District, it was decided to raise funds for consolation and support. Zhang Linhua and Lu Lianqing were appointed to collect donations from various factories. A total of 331.1 yuan and 73 small coins were collected. The funds were remitted to Chairman Ma Hailun through the Bank of China on the 10th of this month for consolation purposes. A list of the names and amounts of all donors will be published separately.</p>
<p>Fan'ai School Donates More Than 50 Yuan Mr. Lu Qiwen, principal of Fan'ai School in West Shanghai, and Mr. Zhuang Yangfeng, director and director of studies of the school, were motivated by patriotic indignation. They organized the students of the elementary school into a fundraising team to support Ma, divided into three groups, each with about five people. They carried cloth flags and collection boxes and set out to collect donations along the way, but only for one day (November 28). It is reported that more than 50 yuan has been collected. The school authorities believe that all the students in the elementary school are children of poor workers, and their own economic capacity is limited. It is not convenient to remit the money directly to General Ma Zhanshan in Heilongjiang, so they entrusted it to this newspaper to transfer to the Life Weekly for remittance to Hailun.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Thanks for the Donation of Medicine The National Pharmaceutical Industry Association received a reply telegram from Ma Zhanshan: To the Executive Committee of the Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, I have received your telegram. The medicine you sent is appreciated by the three armies. The organization of a team for rescue and care is deeply appreciated. On behalf of my comrades, I would like to express my gratitude in advance. Our government has now moved to Hailun. Ma Zhanshan, 30th year.</p>

Another friend from Mitsui Bussan expressed his desire to follow, but due to his young age (only 14 years old), he was persuaded not to go for fear that he would not be able to travel long distances. He was escorted back to Shanghai by the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau. In addition to intensifying military training, the delegation is also conducting political training. It has also been decided that the finances will be completely transparent. As for the comrades who went to Nanyang to raise funds, they set off yesterday.</p>

<h3>Emergency Meeting Held by Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Huacheng Company Insults All Reporters</p>
<p>Resolved to Question the Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Association held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. Executive committee members Tang Demin, Ma Chonggan, Yu Kongwo, Xu Chihen, Wu Zhongyi, Fan Jingwu, Jiang Jianhou, etc., attended. Hang Shijun, the chairman, first reported that members Chen Qiying, Shi Zhaotai, and Yu Qiacheng sent letters stating that after reading the notice published in the newspaper for several consecutive days by the four lawyers Wu, Wang, Yuan, and Chen of the Legal Firm, representing the Huacheng Tobacco Company, it was stated that since the rubber printing shop theft case, "several people claiming to be journalists came to our company and threatened us with dangerous words, stating that if they were not given considerable remuneration, they would publicize the matter."</p>
<p>Coming from the mouths of lawyers and published in newspapers, this matter is of great importance to the personality and reputation of all journalists. The association should send a severe letter to the four lawyers, demanding that the company announce the names and serving newspapers of the extortionist journalists within a specified time limit for punishment, etc. After discussion, everyone agreed that since the company's advertisement did not point out the names of the extortionists and also referred to several journalists in general, it was actually an insult to the personality and reputation of all journalists and should be seriously investigated and dealt with according to the law. It was resolved that the association would seriously question the company, ordering them to hand over the extortionist journalists and to bear the corresponding responsibility for publicly insulting all journalists in the newspaper, with a deadline for a substantive response. At the same time, the association's legal counsel should prepare legal procedures, and if a satisfactory result cannot be obtained, legal action will be taken. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens Pay Housing Taxes</h3>
<p>Municipal Bureau of Finance Announcement</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Finance formulated measures for citizens to pay their own housing taxes in August, which were submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. It was decided that the Municipal South Tax Collection Office would conduct a pilot program starting this winter. Once successful, it would be implemented throughout the city. The present newspaper had recorded it on August 19th. It is now learned that the Municipal Bureau of Finance's winter housing tax collection has ended. According to the report submitted by the Municipal South Tax Collection Office, the citizens who complied with the payment were enthusiastic. However, the area under the jurisdiction of the office is relatively large, with a large number of residents. The new regulations were promulgated quickly, and there may be people who do not fully understand them, or because they could not complete the payment in time, they missed the opportunity. In view of this, the bureau specifically requested and obtained approval from the Municipal Government to continue the pilot program for one season in the spring of the 21st year by the Municipal South Tax Collection Office, in order to popularize it. It also issued a notice of the measures for citizens to pay their own housing taxes, requiring all citizens in the South Shanghai area to know and comply. The recorded measures for citizens to pay their own housing taxes are as follows: (1) Businesses and residents in the city who can voluntarily pay the housing tax for the current quarter to the competent tax collection office for verification and collection before the 10th of the first month of the quarter will be given a preferential discount of 2% of the amount paid (i.e., 2 yuan per 100 yuan). (Note) Regardless of whether it is the owner or the tenant, those who pay the full amount of housing tax to the competent tax collection office will enjoy the full preferential discount. (2) If the aforementioned deadline is exceeded, even if the payment is made voluntarily, the right to enjoy the preferential treatment shall not be enjoyed. (3) When paying their own housing taxes, the owner's donation and the tenant's donation must be paid at the same time, and the previous quarter's donation ticket must be submitted for verification. After verification, the receipt for the current quarter's housing tax will be issued together with the receipt. (4) The receipt for the self-paid housing tax has five copies. The first two copies will be issued to the donor for retention. The third copy will be used as a basis for offsetting the housing tax. The fourth copy will be submitted for verification, and the fifth copy will be the stub. (Note) When giving the preferential discount, the donor should sign and seal the receipt for offsetting the housing tax for verification. (5) If each household's housing tax is collected by the tax collection staff of the bureau, even if it is before the 10th of the first month of the quarter, no preferential discount will be given.</p>

<h3>The Property Dispute Case of Sheng Xuanhuai's Grandson is Suspended</h3>
<p>Lin Fengwen and Lin Fengjun, grandsons of Sheng Xuanhuai, former Qing Palace Minister, recently hired lawyer Dong Yu to file a criminal complaint with the First Special Court against their mother, Sheng Zecheng, aunt, Sheng Fangyi, and nine others, accusing them of encroaching on the property that their mother should have received. The Special Court had once summoned them for questioning, but the defendants did not appear, and the hearing was postponed. This newspaper has already recorded these details. Yesterday afternoon, the presiding judge Shen Shumu opened the Fourth Court for a continued hearing. The defendants did not appear, and lawyer Li Xinyang arrived to represent them. Lawyer Dong first stated that the defendants had not appeared twice and should be arrested with a warrant from the court. Lawyer Li then stated that the plaintiffs had not filed a claim with the civil court for confirmation of inheritance rights, so it is not yet known whether they have inheritance rights. Moreover, the defendants discovered Zhuang Taifuren's will, which does not raise any questions about the third house (i.e., the plaintiffs' mother). The will is currently stored in the court and can be investigated. The plaintiffs are now rushing to file a criminal complaint and should be dismissed. Lawyer Dong immediately presented a letter from the defendant Sheng Shouyi to the plaintiffs, stating that the letter stated that each of the two plaintiffs could be given 14,000 yuan, which acknowledges that the plaintiffs have inheritance rights. Judge Shen stated that the plaintiffs must first file a claim with the civil court for confirmation of inheritance rights before this case can proceed, and the letter from Sheng Aiyi presented by the plaintiffs cannot prove that they have obtained inheritance rights. The case was then ordered to be suspended.</p>
<h3>Strong Winds in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai yesterday morning was warm and humid. There was a slight rain in the afternoon. In the evening, the north wind suddenly rose, and the temperature dropped sharply. Shops closed early, and there were very few pedestrians at midnight. Ferry service on the Huangpu River was almost non-existent.</p>
<h3>Huang Chujiu's Creditors Request to Participate in the Emerald Stone Issue</h3>
<p>Following the collapse of the Shanghai Riye Bank, the former French Concession Court repeatedly summoned and issued rulings, as previously reported. Now, the Second Special District Court summoned parties again yesterday regarding the emerald stone issue within Huang's estate, presided over by Judge Wang Weizhen. Liu Baogeng, representing lawyer Lin Yingqing, made a statement on behalf of interested parties, and the matter was adjourned for further review. Creditors Qin Binggen and others, represented by lawyer Yan Luqing, argued that at the court hearing on the 2nd of this month, Tan Yigong, the lawyer representing Huang Chujiu's family, should not have opposed their participation. Therefore, they submitted a formal request to continue their participation. The original request is recorded below: Request to approve continued participation in execution. The petitioners are creditors of the Gongfa Company and have a close interest in this case. They appeared in court on the 2nd of this month to participate. Unexpectedly, the lawyer representing Huang Chujiu's family opposed them. The petitioners were already parties to this case, and the emerald stone issue was initiated by the petitioners (see the files of the former French Concession Court, May 7th). Now, the Huang family actually opposes their participation, which is incomprehensible. The partnership assets of Gongfa Company are only sufficient to cover 20% of the debt, and the shareholders are jointly and severally liable. Huang Chujiu was the chairman and shareholder of Gongfa Company, and also a debtor of Gongfa Company. The creditors of Gongfa Company can naturally intervene in his estate. Now, the Huang family opposes their participation, which is also incomprehensible. The liquidator in this case is also only representing the creditors. Now, the creditors themselves are participating and are being opposed, which is also incomprehensible. Every additional penny recovered from Huang Chujiu's estate means an additional penny for the creditors. Every additional penny sold also means an additional penny for the creditors. The interests are so closely related, yet the Huang family opposes their participation, which is incomprehensible. The lawyer representing the Huang family claims that there are dozens of lawyers representing the creditors. If every lawyer, like Yan Luqing, attends the hearing to represent their clients, the court will be too small to accommodate them, which is especially strange. Rejecting people's lawsuits due to the small size of the court is laughable, which is also incomprehensible. The lawyer representing the Huang family also claims that since the creditors are not attacking the liquidator, they trust and are satisfied with the liquidator and do not need to participate themselves. Not attacking is not the same as trusting and being satisfied. Even if there is distrust or dissatisfaction in their hearts, they may not express it for the sake of avoiding trouble. Moreover, attacking or not attacking is not relevant to this issue, which is also incomprehensible. Furthermore, everyone suspects Huang's estate, and his lawyer opposes participation, which is truly doubly suspicious. It would be even better to welcome participation. Now, this kind of opposition to participation is truly regrettable for the Huang family. Therefore, they submit this request to approve continued participation in execution, to assist the plaintiff. If there is a ruling or instruction, please deliver it.</p>
<h3>Wang Long Receives Six Intimidating Letters</h3>
<p>Talk Scheduled at Dasheng Temple in Hongzhen</p>
<p>Extortionist Li Jinzhi Caught on the Spot</p>
<p>Wang Long, owner of Wang Longji Laundry Company at No. 2534 Zhoujiakou Road and a native of Ningbo, received six threatening letters from gangsters between the 12th of last month and the 7th of this month. The meeting places were arranged in Tangjia Nong, Qiqihar Road, and Xiaowang Temple in Zhabei, etc. The person coming was to hold a shoe box as a mark. Wang reported the situation to the General Inspectorate of the General Police Department, which dispatched detectives to search but found nothing. The day before yesterday, another letter arrived, arranging a meeting near Dasheng Temple in Hongzhen, in the Chinese district. The person coming was to hold a reed bag and a towel, and bring $1,000 in silver and 500 taels of silver, and must not break the promise; otherwise, they would take drastic measures. Wang Long again reported the letter to the police department. At about 4 p.m., Chinese Detective Tang Jian and Detective Wu Changkai, instructed Wang to follow the letter, carry a reed bag and towel, and wait at the designated location. The detectives hired a car and drove there, meeting with detectives from the Public Security Bureau of the Association, stopping about half a li away from Dasheng Temple, and observing the situation. After a while, Li Jinzhi, a native of Tongzhou, came out of the temple and met with Wang Long. The detectives immediately ordered the driver to drive to the location and arrested Li Jinzhi on the spot, taking him to Huishan Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court, First Court, where Zhang Tianyin, the police department's lawyer, explained the situation and requested an extension of the detention to arrest accomplices. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Wang Long, stated that the defendant asked him if he was Wang Long. He replied that he was. The defendant was about to continue talking when the police detectives' car arrived and immediately arrested him. He had previously gone to Tangjia Nong, Qiqihar Road, etc. with the detectives, but no one came to meet him. The defendant claimed that in the morning he was sipping tea in a small teahouse on Kunming Road when a friend surnamed Ji and someone else came and invited him to Dasheng Temple in Hongzhen to pray to the gods. In the afternoon, they went to the temple together and lingered around. He suspected that they were engaged in illegal activities, so he followed them to find out what they were doing. If there was any clue, he would report it to the police and get some minor reward. A moment later, they went outside and said they were coming. He hurried to follow them and was arrested by the police detectives just as he left the temple gate. He knew nothing about the threatening letters and asked for judgment. Judge Shen Bingrong reviewed the statement and declared to the defendant that his statement was untrue and could not be excused, and ordered him to be returned to custody and investigated further at a later date.</p>

<h3>Boy Killed by Public Bus</h3>
<p>Liu Gensan, a boy from Jiangbei, 14 years old, residing at No. 306 Fudeli, Huishan Road, had a leather stall at the intersection of Qiwupu Road. Yesterday evening at about 5:15, the boy was walking in the middle of the road when a Route 2 public bus, traveling from east to west, sped toward him. He was unable to avoid it in time and was fatally injured, dying instantly. The police officer from Post No. 2550 arrived and transported the body to Tongren Hospital and then to the morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Filed in Wan Dagong Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Landlord Cannot Escape Blame</p>
<p>Shop Owner Flees Far Away</p>
<p>Wan Dagong Oil Shop at No. 86 Qiaojiazhakou, Ninghe Road in this city, newly opened on November 6th of this year, but closed the next day. The creditors reported the case to the local police station, which sealed the shop and detained the shop owner's wife, Zhu Pu, and her son, Zhu A-wu, for interrogation and bail. Dozens of creditors appointed representatives Chen Jinchang and Qu Zhifu to hire lawyer Zhu Shuzhen to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the local court. The lawsuit stated that the defendants Zhu Pu and her son Zhu A-wu colluded to set up a shop to deceive and defraud people by issuing fake receipts. They pretended to be Wan Dagong Oil Shop, selling six catties and twelve taels of soybean oil for one yuan. First, nearby residents, and then people from further away, all bought with cash. From morning to afternoon, they collected more than 2,000 yuan in oil money. The shop owner, Zhu A-wu, sat at the cash register, issued receipts, and collected the money. Nearby people, even four hours after purchasing, held receipts to get oil. Zhu A-wu said, "I am the shop owner and the landlord. Everyone knows me, so why worry? Come and get it tomorrow. It's all sold out today." Customers believed him and dispersed. But the next morning, when they went to get oil, they found the shop door tightly closed and all the staff had fled. They went to the shop owner and landlord Zhu A-wu's mother, Zhu Pu, to reason with her, but she suddenly claimed that the shop was opened by someone else and had nothing to do with the Zhu family. When asked who the tenant was, she claimed that she only knew the surname was Wang and did not know the name. When asked for the lease, she said she didn't have it. All sorts of evasions made it impossible to deny the suspicion. Those who bought oil were mostly common people, such as those who sell fried dough sticks, dried tofu, squid, sesame cakes, and cooks, who pawned their clothes and borrowed money in the hope of getting a good deal. Now, everything is gone, and their livelihoods are affected and their finances are in dire straits. The harm done is difficult to describe in detail. If this trend continues, the consequences will be dire. Yesterday, Judge Wei held a court hearing. The defendants Zhu Pu and Zhu A-wu did not appear in court. Only the plaintiffs Chen Jinchang and others appeared with their lawyer. After a brief interrogation by the judge, they were ordered to leave and wait for the defendants to be summoned again for further verification.</p>

<h3>It is Not Advisable to Burn Red Dates for Children Suffering from Measles</h3>
<p>This year's weather has been warm since the beginning of winter, resembling spring. Many children in Shanghai have developed measles as a result. Generally, when children get measles, people burn red dates in the patient's room to encourage the measles to come out quickly. According to Dr. Zhu Mengzai, a pediatrician at Yifeng Lane, Guizhou Road, red dates are suitable for cases of smallpox where the scabs cannot form. Burning red dates thickens the skin and helps scabs form easily. For measles, it is best to boil cilantro (coriander) in water and use the steam to fumigate the patient, which is effective in promoting the eruption of the measles.</p>
<h3>Reader's Letter</h3>
<p>A message from Mr. Wen Defu (The whole nation should unite to save the country): In this unprecedented national crisis, all our citizens are weeping and are willing to sacrifice their personal happiness to protect our Chinese nation. Even if their blood stains the battlefield, they will die generously without looking back, because rather than clinging to life and fearing death and suffering under the iron heel of the Japanese invaders in the future, it is better to struggle now to survive. I dare say that 400 million compatriots, except for those special classes, are all sympathetic, because the special classes are corrupted by money and have a cruel nature. To go further, most of them are hypocrites who only seek their own private interests and do not care about the lives and deaths of the people, clinging to monetarism, even scheming against each other and openly fighting each other, making the whole country a mess. Otherwise, how dare Japan, a small country, be so rampant and invade our divine land? As the ancient saying goes, "People must insult themselves before others will insult them." Taking the Japanese invasion of the Eastern Provinces as an example, the military commanders who possessed heavy troops openly ordered non-resistance, and their responsibility for losing land and humiliating the country is difficult to shirk. Our economic severance with Japan is the only way to deal with the violent Japanese, which no one can deny. However, the special classes are actually monopolizing large quantities of enemy goods and transporting them into the country, which is so sad. In my personal opinion, and perhaps the opinion of the majority of the people, if we want to save the country, it is impossible to succeed without the unity of the whole nation.</p>

The Yangtze River basin is cloudy with drizzle or gradually clearing. There are strong northwest winds in the Yellow Sea, and north to northeast winds in the East China Sea. There is a cyclone in the Korea Strait, caused by a low pressure passing through and moving northeast-eastward. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 63.5 degrees and the lowest was 50.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 62.2 degrees and the lowest was 38.1 degrees.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor: I recently read in the newspaper that my daughter, Xie Shuming, is still in the Youth Support Ma Corps. After investigating, I found that Shuming is physically weak and cannot handle this work. Her family has already persuaded her to return home to rest. The report is not consistent with the facts, so I am writing to correct it. Sincerely, Xie Liheng, December 11.</p>
<p>To the editor: Today's Min Guo Daily published a declaration from the Arsenal Labor Union, which I found shocking. It was reported that representatives from the Anti-Japanese Association of various universities in the city were holding a meeting when plainclothes police disrupted it and captured Wang Fusheng on the spot. It was said that he was a worker in the arsenal, or a worker in the steel mill. After checking the list of workers in our factory, there is no one named Wang Fusheng. As for whether he is a worker in the steel mill, we cannot verify it because the steel mill is not within the scope of the arsenal. As for the declaration from the Arsenal Labor Union, all the workers in our factory have not heard of it, and misunderstandings have arisen as a result, causing the workers to automatically close the labor union, which is now unable to function. Fearing that outsiders would not understand the truth, I am writing to clarify this to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Shanghai Arsenal, December 11.</p>
<p>To the honorable news editor of the Shen Bao: Respectfully, on the 9th of this month, representatives from the Student Union came to our school to report that the person in charge of the Municipal Party Headquarters, in the midst of this patriotic movement, instructed hooligans to kidnap a Peking University student and beat a Central University student. The evidence is conclusive, and everyone was shocked. We organized a team to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and arrived at about 6 p.m. The whole team stood outside the Party Headquarters, and representatives were sent inside to request a meeting with the Standing Committee member. The doorman claimed that the committee members were not in. Then, Committee Member Tao Baichuan was seen walking down from upstairs. The representatives immediately went forward to request to speak with him, but Committee Member Tao turned around and quickly fled to the back door. The students felt that our school's discipline was so strict and our attitude was so sincere, but the person in charge of the Party Headquarters regarded the public as snakes and scorpions. If they were not guilty and afraid, they would not have acted like this. They expressed their grief and indignation. However, the students were well-trained, and all previous petitions have been praised by public opinion. At this time, we still maintained our consistent spirit and the order was not disturbed in the slightest. Unexpectedly, at that time, more and more people from outside gathered, and suddenly dozens of people in plainclothes without banners or symbols shouted and rushed into the Party Headquarters, smashing glass and other things. At that time, a few students from our school were moved by curiosity and went inside to watch the excitement. The commanders of our school quickly tried to stop them, and immediately reorganized the team and went to the Municipal Government to petition. However, because things happened suddenly, your reporter may not have witnessed it on the spot, resulting in inaccurate rumors that have slandered our school's reputation. Therefore, I am writing to state the situation at that time and hope that you will publish this letter to clarify the truth. We have always admired your newspaper's fair arguments and are confident that you will grant our request. With respect, Fudan University Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, December 11.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Black Horse Gets a Mate</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhouchan</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, I visited Ma Mengrong at Rongzhai in Xieqiao. I read the Free Talk in my spare time. I learned that Tao Zaidong was seeking a mate for the black horse to praise loyalty and courage. I immediately told Master Meng. The master replied in response: "Red Sheep." Thinking about it carefully, the contrast is quite clever and neat. During the reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty, Chai Wang presented ten volumes of "Prophecies of Bing and Ding Years," covering more than 1,200 years from the 52nd year of King Zhuangxiang of Qin (Bingwu year) to the 12th year of Tianfu in the Later Han Dynasty of the Five Dynasties (Dingwei year). Among them, there were 21 years that were Bingwu or Dingwei years. Those years were all years when China had troubles. Wang submitted the book intending to speak euphemistically to warn the current emperor. Everyone believed that Bing belonged to fire, the color red, and Wei was a sheep. Therefore, the time of national crisis was called the Red Sheep Calamity Year. This year is Xinwei year, and we have suffered another national disaster. Red Sheep can be called a clever antithesis to Black Horse.</p>
<p>I hope that the officials of the current administration will use this as a warning. Also, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was also called the Red Sheep Rebellion, which was a homophone of Hong (Xiuquan) and Yang (Xiuqing). At that time, they occupied sixteen provinces, and their momentum was extremely strong. If it were not for the loyalty of Zeng and Zuo to the Qing Dynasty, then China would have been restored long ago. The current National Government has clearly stated that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was the precursor of the national revolution and should not be called a rebellion. The Red Sheep's resistance to the Manchus and the Black Horse's resistance to the Japanese are both the glory of our Chinese nation. To use them as a match, I wonder if Master Zaidong would agree.</p>
<p>Do Not Remove Garden Grass Zhai Fu Talks</p>
<h3>A Teacher and Parent's Reply丨Freedom in Advancement丨(Continued)</h3>
<p>"Mr. Dai believes that you young people are the lifeblood of the nation, and I share this view. You must not underestimate yourselves. Don't be 'young masters of trees'! Don't be 'young ladies of trees'! Don't let towering trees cast their shadows over you! Fight against the pests! Reach out for moisture, fertilizer, air, and sunlight! Only then can you build yourselves into pillars of China, and only then can you be considered the lifeblood of the nation.</p>
<p>"Since I advocate for freedom in advancement, I must also explain what 'freedom' means. Self means action based on one's own initiative. A collective's self means the collective's actions are directed by the collective's own will. The term 'freedom' encompasses various meanings such as autonomy, self-determination, initiative, and contentment. Broadly speaking, it means everyone gets what they deserve. A free person takes their mind as the commander-in-chief; the opposite is a slave. They themselves do not want to be slaves, nor do they want others to be their slaves. Licentiousness is not freedom, because a licentious person is a slave to their own desires and cannot extricate themselves. A person who becomes a slave to their own desires loses freedom. Licentious youth certainly cannot become adults; licentious adults can only be considered grown but not accomplished. Adults, youth, and children should all live under a single moral standard. Double standards and triple standards are simply the result of insufficient empathy. Young people should not use the beautiful name of freedom to live a licentious life; teachers and parents should not use the excuse of licentiousness to deprive young children of the freedom necessary for their growth. Based on the above, I arrive at a conclusion that is the opposite of Mr. Dai's. My conclusion is:</p>
<p>"Without freedom, one cannot become an adult." (End)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes About General Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>— Duo Bai</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, chairman of Heilongjiang Province, was uniquely capable of leading his valiant soldiers to resist the powerful invaders amidst an atmosphere of bleak non-resistance when the Japanese invaders ran rampant. Although the disparity in numbers was vast, he fought to kill the enemy and repeatedly achieved extraordinary feats. It is fitting that the people of the country, upon hearing of this, rejoiced, sang, danced, and eagerly donated funds for support. In addition to admiring the General, the reporter will record what he has heard about the General's life to contribute to this free discussion.</p>
<p>The General's given name is Xiuxing, and he is from Wula Town, Jilin. His family traditionally engaged in agriculture. The General abandoned agriculture for the military. He initially served under Wu Junsheng, merely as a squad leader with no remarkable reputation. Subsequently, he was gradually promoted for his success in suppressing bandits. His administration was honest and fair, and his reputation was impressive. The people of Heilongjiang respected and admired him. The General has long held a deep hatred for the Japanese and has always wanted to strike them. He was particularly indignant and wanted to die when he witnessed the authorities' non-resistance. Therefore, his resistance against the Japanese army revealed his unparalleled bravery and indomitability.</p>
<p>The General enjoyed practicing martial arts from a young age but never attended school. Therefore, even in his adulthood, he remained illiterate. However, since recent years, he has felt the inconvenience of illiteracy. He has been diligently studying whenever he has spare time from managing the army. Therefore, he is now able to review official documents and correspondence.</p>
<h3>World News in Brief</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Ancient Tribe in the Himalayas: Nine years ago, British female explorer Miss J. Cossley-Batt discovered the ancient Chaldean tribe in the inaccessible heights of the Himalayas. This year, Miss Cossley-Batt has teamed up with Dr. I. Baird from Montreal to make a second visit. This tribe has been isolated from the world for centuries, with a population between six hundred and eight hundred. They live at an altitude of over 17,000 feet, close to Tibet. The people are extremely healthy and mostly long-lived, surpassing any other nation in the world. Their daily food is entirely vegetables. They live in mountain caves, without houses. However, their level of culture is extremely high, surpassing even that of the Egyptians. They can be said to be the originators of world culture. They possess many valuable manuscripts and paintings, all works of their ancestors. Dr. Baird brought back a painting that is 750 years old. They have also made many discoveries in medicine. On their way there, the two encountered several dangers. Once they were attacked by a savage tribe, nearly losing their lives. In the end, they finally reached their destination. Recently, they returned fully loaded.</p>
<h3>Iron-Stemmed Begonia Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Qi Mei</p>
<p>Suzhou Taowu Middle School is located in a quiet and secluded area, surrounded by lush vegetation. Therefore, the school scenery is known for its tranquility. In front of the middle building, there is an iron-stemmed begonia tree. Every year in March of the lunar calendar, delicate flowers bloom. The flowers are small and pale red. When in full bloom, the entire tree is covered with blossoms, like a young woman blushing, smiling in the wind, with a charming elegance that is no less than the cherry blossoms of Fusang (Japan). Unexpectedly, in the middle of last month, when the north wind was bitterly cold and the trees were bare, the grass withered, it suddenly sprouted leaves and buds, blooming more than a dozen flowers. Moreover, the flowers fade and are replaced by others, enduring the cold until now without ceasing to bloom. The green leaves and red blossoms are delicate and vibrant, as if not suffering from the wind and frost. Examining plants, which flourish and wither according to the seasons, why would this flower bloom out of season? There must be a reason. Therefore, I hastily record it and dare to consult with naturalists around the world.</p>
<p>He often uses a brush to write large characters, bold and unrestrained, with natural and heroic strokes.</p>
<p>The General is naturally filial. He attends to his elderly mother morning and evening, without fail, for decades. Whenever his mother is sick, he personally serves her medicine, not entrusting it to others. He also readily helps those in need. He generously grants loans to relatives and friends who seek assistance due to poverty, as well as to visitors who come to beg for help, without expecting repayment. Therefore, despite serving as an official for many years, he remains an honest official with no surplus savings.</p>
<p>The General has unique insights into military strategy and tactics, gained from his years of experience. Those who boast of graduating from military academies feel ashamed in his presence. For example, the trenches he dug, according to the report of a foreign expert after observation, were exquisitely and appropriately designed, with ingenious arrangements, which was the first time they had been seen in China. No wonder the Japanese were disheartened upon seeing them and dared not engage in battle lightly.</p>
<p>In addition to being proficient in martial arts, the General can also simultaneously fire two guns with both hands, hitting targets within a hundred paces without fail. His subordinates follow his example and receive the General's rigorous training. Therefore, their marksmanship is also not weak. The fact that they were able to shoot down three Japanese aircraft and repeatedly repel heavily armed cannons with inferior equipment and old ammunition is due to their accurate shooting.</p>
<p>The General's personal life is very frugal. Except for occasionally using Chinese silk products, he never uses imported goods. He refuses to accept Japanese goods even for his family members. He is good at recognizing talent. Anyone with a special skill or expertise is retained in his staff and provided with suitable positions. Therefore, there are many talented and outstanding individuals among his subordinates. He can share weal and woe with his soldiers and is strict in rewards and punishments, without showing favoritism. Therefore, all officers and soldiers are happy to serve. The several victories over the Japanese army were not accidental.</p>
<h3>He Xiangning's Preparedness for Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>— Jun Qiang</p>
<p>Ms. He Xiangning is angered by the unrestrained behavior of the violent Japanese. Fearing that war might break out, she believes that rescue and relief efforts are an urgent priority and should be prepared as soon as possible. Therefore, she is exhibiting her own calligraphy and paintings, as well as collecting works from famous artists, in Shanghai. The proceeds from the sales will be used to establish a women's anti-Japanese rescue and relief training class. The association's affairs are being handled by Zheng Hongnian, Cai Yuanpei, Ye Yu Hu, Liu Yazi, Zhu Shaoping, Wang Yingbin, Li Qiujun, Liu Haisu, Wang Jiyuan, Sun Xueni, Xie Gongzhan, Yu Danhan, Qian Shoutie, Zhang Shanzi, Li Zuhan, Tang Guanyu, Xue Baolun, He Tianjian, and others. The scale is very large. It is said that the collected calligraphy and paintings are all works by major artists from across the country, totaling five hundred pieces. Five hundred tickets are being sold, priced at thirty yuan each, and are being sold by Mr. Zheng Hongnian. A separate ancient painting exhibition area will be established, and its prices will not be subject to this limit. Ms. He is the widow of Mr. Liao Zhongkai, a pioneer of the party and the nation. Mr. Liao sacrificed himself for China's freedom and equality in opposition to imperialism. Ms. He continues her husband's unfinished work and is able to maintain a firm and courageous spirit in fighting against everything. She is truly an outstanding talent in the Chinese women's community. Her artistic spirit and reputation have long been widely known. Coupled with the masterpieces of various great artists, which are usually not easy to obtain, this is an opportunity to acquire treasures for posterity at a cost of several tens of yuan. Indirectly, it can also help alleviate national crisis. It is beneficial both to the public and private interests. The exhibition is scheduled to be held at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Short News</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Gao Jun, styled Shangzhi, is from Nansha, Jiangsu. He is skilled in painting, with bold and unrestrained brushstrokes, showing a detached and extraordinary spirit. He also studies ancient methods and delves deeply into painting principles.

<h3>Idle Talk from the Di Xiang Studio</h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Cen Chunxuan (Continued)</p>
<p>When the imperial edict appointing Chunxuan as Minister of Posts and Communications was issued, Chunxuan first requested the dismissal of Vice Minister Zhu Baokui, pointing out that he was fond of money and incompetent. After Baokui was dismissed, officials from ministers down to the lower ranks were suspicious and fearful, jokingly calling him a ferocious tiger. At that time, the Cantonese bandits' forces were rising again, so Shikai secretly plotted with Yikuang, saying that the opportunity to lure the tiger away from the mountain had arrived. They should use a trick to move Chunxuan out, so as to avoid him constantly watching them. They slandered to the Empress Dowager and suggested that Yikuang should bring it up, and Shikai would support from within. Yikuang was overjoyed. Therefore, Shikai presented a special memorial, stating that the Cantonese bandits were the worst in the country, causing unrest every year. Chunxuan had governed Guangdong, but the bandits had disappeared. This showed that when the right person governed, there was order, and when the wrong person governed, there was chaos. The border areas should not be entrusted to anyone but the right person. The Empress Dowager was moved and asked Yikuang, "What does Shikai say?" Yikuang replied, "What Shikai says is the public opinion of the country. Chunxuan's talent is desired by everyone to be their superior, especially in Guangdong." The Empress Dowager nodded and issued an edict, summoning Chunxuan. The Empress Dowager said, "Your loyalty to the country and your courage in handling affairs did not start today. Before you opened the mansion, I had already recognized it in my heart. The speed of your promotion was not given to you by the emperor, but by me. The responsibility of restoring order in Guangdong belongs to no one but you. Your return to the Phoenix Pool (high position) is not without reason. You must be respectful and cautious in your work." Chunxuan humbly agreed, but was sweating. He had already received news that Yikuang and Shikai were colluding to remove him. He left the capital angrily and lingered at sea on his way south. Yikuang and Shikai plotted again to prevent him from taking office in Guangdong. They secretly instructed someone to take Kang Youwei's and Chunxuan's individual photos, tear them apart and put them back together, making them stand side by side. Then they took another photo and presented it to the Empress Dowager, saying that Cen and Kang were meeting in Shanghai, secretly discussing abolishing the Empress Dowager and supporting the emperor, like the Coup of 1898. The Empress Dowager suddenly thought of the past, unsure if it was a trick. She became furious and said, "I knew that Chunxuan had been with the Baohuang Hui (Protect the Emperor Society). I observed his actions during the Qinwang (Loyal to the Emperor) campaign and he did not seem to be. Since then, he has been able to revitalize the territories he has governed. How could I have known that he still harbored different ambitions, associating with the rebel party, plotting against an old woman? Although, his merits cannot be denied, and his virtues cannot be forgotten. I will temporarily dismiss him." Yikuang and Shikai's plan succeeded, and Chunxuan's unjust grievance had no way to be appealed. He settled in Shanghai. During the Sichuan rebellion in 1911, the Prince Regent Zaifeng accepted the request of Duke Zhen of the State, Zai Ze, and ordered Chunxuan to investigate and handle the situation. He was again appointed Governor of Sichuan, but before he could take office, the North and South had ceased fighting and made peace. The border officials jointly requested abdication, and Chunxuan also listed his name. He was sent by the government to Fujian Province to suppress the rebellion and was again appointed as the Director-General of the Hanyuechuan Railway. He lowered his ambition and served Shikai, which was very unlike his usual behavior. Some said that he was working for the sake of poverty, which was not his original intention. Later, he participated in all of the campaigns against Yuan. He fled to the South Seas Islands to avoid persecution. In the middle, he persuaded Lu Rongting to raise troops against Hongxian. Rongting had previously been subordinate to Xuan's department and was grateful for his kindness. Therefore, he welcomed Xuan into Guangzhou and set up the Military Affairs Council in Zhaoqing. The public elected Tang Jiyao as the Pacification General and Chunxuan as the Deputy Pacification General, exercising the powers of the Pacification General, practically the deputy of a separatist regime. After taking office, he issued a statement saying that Shikai had retired from the court, and Xuan would retire in the evening. He kept his word and went into the wilderness. Later, he joined the Guangzhou Military Government as the Director-General. After retiring, he never came out again for ten years. Speaking of Xuan's character, he was fierce in politics, strict in governing his subordinates, upright, and outspoken. He always held his own opinions and was stubborn and unyielding. This was not without its merits. However, after the Republic, his missions for Shikai were sometimes rejected, sometimes accepted, giving people an excuse to criticize him. For example, his favor of a certain actor and granting him military power also tarnished his reputation. However, minor flaws are not enough to obscure his great virtues. It is probably what is called a gentleman's fault.</p>

<h3>Sharing Hatred with My Son (10)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Zhongshu listened, her moth eyebrows locked. She said, "That's right. The atmosphere these few days has been unstable. Once something happens, the railways will be in their hands. We have no defenses at all. What can we do?" Hua Naiqiang sighed, "Westerners mock our country as a sleeping lion. It seems that if it wakes up, it can accomplish great things. Our people also pride themselves on this. In fact, our country has long become a sick lion on the verge of death, completely useless. The people of the Sun Country (Japan) have long seen through this. In their words, they can also quote the two sentences 'Heaven gives, but if you don't take, you will suffer the consequences'." A country must be attacked by itself before others attack it. The various failures of the former Qing dynasty in diplomacy had endless repercussions. But since the Xinhai Revolution, twenty years have passed in a hurry. Internal strife has been endless. There has never been a day of unity since the National Revolution, and the division between Beijing and Guangdong has never ended. It's all the fault of these rulers. As the saying goes, "When those above and below compete for profit, the country is in danger." Otherwise, why would the people of our country have suffered so many humiliations? The May 9th Incident, the May 3rd Incident, the May 30th Incident. Remembering the past is a guide for the future. Why can't we still cheer up today? What about ten years of recuperation and ten years of training? Our people only have lip service to patriotism. In reality, we have not built any foundation. Naturally, how can we not be invaded by strong neighbors? How hateful, how hateful." Hua Naiqiang said here, stood up, and pulled out the sword from his waist, its cold light shining. This sword was given to him by Principal Xiong Feng and he always wore it. His face revealed an agitated color. He said to Zhongshu with emotion, "The ancients danced with the sword at the crowing of the rooster, thinking of their homeland. A good man should also be like this. The rivers and mountains are dim, and the atmosphere of invaders has risen. Now is the time for us to repay the country." Dancing with the sword at the crowing of the rooster was also inspired by the spirit of patriotism. Now there are many young people. It is a pity that they cannot maintain this spirit of patriotism. Instead, they constantly attack themselves, abandon themselves, and are seduced by demons, leading them down the path of depravity. After saying that, he waved his sword and started to dance with a swooshing sound. He saw the dance becoming faster and faster, a white light covering his figure. Sometimes east, sometimes west, suddenly rising and suddenly falling. Zhongshu was watching from the side very attentively. At this time, several classmates saw it from afar and ran over to watch. More and more people gathered, forming a circle. Zhongshu also stood up and climbed up an elm tree with a female classmate to watch. Hua Naiqiang finished the sword dance and suddenly stopped, standing still, not even out of breath. Everyone clapped their hands and said, "General Fei is talented and capable." Zhongshu also clapped her slender hands and jumped down from the tree. The sky was gradually darkening, and the bell rang. It was time for supper. So everyone crowded into the dining room. Unexpectedly, they were having their last meal.</p>

Prices were stable, and the fluctuations in each session were very small. Compared with the previous day, there was also little change, as the bond market environment was dull, and the market buying and selling was very clear. However, in the afternoon session, due to weak market sentiment, the bond market environment seemed difficult to be optimistic. The market situation was very different from before.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Slack and Tending to Weaken</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak. Because the country's affairs are in turmoil, people's hearts are confused and uncertain, and the money market is difficult to ease, and the price of gold has plummeted, the market atmosphere is very bleak. Currently, only the Sichuan traders still have some business, and other traders have very little activity. In short, the yarn market cannot turn around because of the unstable situation.</p>
<p>Extremely Few People Bid to Buy: The opening of the raw cotton market saw a lack of buyers due to the sharp fall in Indian cotton and the decline in the gold market. Each month fell by 1, 3, and 4 fen. In the afternoon, each month fell by 1, 3, and 4 fen. The situation in the market was very scattered, and there were not many transactions.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Selling Pressure Re-emerges</h3>
<p>Cotton Market Trends Weak: The situation has turned to weaken again due to the sharp fall in the gold market and the sharp decline in Indian cotton, which has caused market sentiment to weaken. Fortunately, there are not many new sellers, and the market is still somewhat flat due to the lack of supply from various sources. However, various factories have no business in current cotton, and the overall situation is not good, and the future is very uncertain.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Falls by 3 Fen: The opening of the Hankou cotton market saw a resurgence of selling pressure due to the fall in Indian cotton and the sharp drop in gold prices. Each month fell by 2 and 3 fen. In the afternoon, some bulls sold out and the market weakened again, with each month falling by 0.5 to 1 fen. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>The Food and River Down Rice Market is Still Extremely Stagnant</h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, about 40 ships arrived, but the port's inventory is still high. Sales on the street are minimal. The downward trend of thick, newly harvested japonica rice is gradually intensifying. The opening prices are each 0.2 yuan lower. Foreign Dujian premium goods are in short supply and stable. Qingjiao, Zhangyan, and Songjiang, etc., arrive continuously in the morning and evening. Trading interest is extremely weak, and prices also follow down by 0.1 yuan. Prices have dropped by several cents, and sales are brisk.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Supplies from various sources are still surging, and the situation has plummeted. The market for western new rice continues to be low, and medium-grade rice is 0.1 to 0.2 yuan cheaper. The arrival of light rice is busy but sales are weak, and prices are 0.1 yuan cheaper. Port foreign premium rice has slightly increased in storage. River inventories are gradually scarce, so prices are conversely firm. Not much early South Harbor rice has arrived, and there is some retail sales, but the situation is also weakening. Customer premium rice has no distinction between good and bad.</p>
<h3>Forward Foreign Rice Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Current Foreign Rice: Sales Are Still Available</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation was even more depressed. The foreign firms' willingness to sell was even stronger due to the falling gold prices, and buyers did not dare to do much business. There were more sellers than buyers, and the market could not support itself. Yesterday, Xinchenglong sold 1,000 tons at a price of 4 taels and 3 mace, which was for the small twist of January. Binlongxiangmao also sent out telegrams. If the reply is confirmed, the market will fall further. A total of about 1,000 tons of returned goods were opened, including 4 taels and 7 fen to 4 taels and 7 mace for the small twist of April, and 5 taels and 4 mace for the No. 1 Saigon of April. Prices have fallen compared to the previous day. However, in addition to continuing to sell on this street, the Hankou traders continued to load the small twist rice for 2,000 bags at a price of 9.78 yuan to 9.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market: Factories Sell Heavily in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw no significant changes in the market for each month after opening in the morning. The near term was held up by factory support, and the far term saw a slight weakening due to factory selling, but there was only about 0.01 yuan difference from the previous day's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, there were huge changes in the near and far terms, due to rumors that three boats of Australian wheat at 3.6 to 3.7 mace had been traded. Fufu and Liang factories sold a total of 600,000 to 700,000 bags in the first three afternoon sessions. Various medium and small factories also sold 200,000 to 300,000 bags in the last three sessions. In total, the factory selling in the afternoon was close to one million bags, so market sentiment was very weak, and non-industry bulls also sold their positions, causing the near and far terms to plummet. It fell by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 fen. Looking at the future, the gold market is also falling, and the situation is not very good. It is difficult to determine the next step. The result was that this month plummeted by 0.3 fen compared to the previous day, January fell by 0.475 fen, February fell by 0.45 fen, March fell by 0.575 fen, April fell by 0.525 fen, and May fell by 0.45 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Especially Far-Term...As Much as 1.7 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw a stabilization of most people's sentiment after opening in the morning, due to the foreign wheat quotation being good by 0.1 to 0.2 jiao. However, the situation is getting worse day by day, and people's hearts are still tired. When the market opened in the afternoon, there was a rare and sharp decline in the near and far terms, due to rumors that three boats of Australian wheat at 3.7 mace had been confirmed. Factory firms continued to sell 60 to 70 truckloads of wheat to the far term, and the general bulls were no longer able to hold up at this point. In addition, the flour market also reported a sharp drop, causing people's hearts to be even weaker, and there was a surge in sellers. April was the target of most, with a difference of about 0.2 mace. This situation is rarely seen recently. The result was that this month fell by 0.9 fen compared to the previous day, January fell by 1 fen, February fell by 1.2 fen, March fell by 1.3 fen, and April fell by a huge 1.7 fen.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories Still Find It Difficult to Comply After Negotiations</h3>
<p>Offers Differ by Tens of Taels...Huang Factory Negotiates Via British Merchants</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no upward trend in the Shanghai foreign merchants' silk market. European merchants have received telegrams for transactions regarding Shanghai white factory prices, and various manufacturers have been invited to negotiate. However, offers still differ by tens of taels, and it is still difficult to comply. English merchants from Huang Factory have quite a need. Jardine and other companies advanced 50 bales of iron and wooden machines, and prices were still relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Sales of Double Palace Silk Are Still Not Weak</h3>
<p>American Mail "Kan Hou" Ships Out 120 Pieces</p>
<p>The double palace factory silk produced by the local Shanghai double palace silk factories has had relatively strong sales recently. The market price is not high, and various European and American silk factories have demand. The transactions are still not deserted. Because of the small price, the factories are unwilling to announce it. The double palace silk held in the hands of various European merchants is also exported smoothly. Yesterday, the American Mail "Kan Hou" exported 120 pieces of Ganli and other double palace silk to the United States.</p>
<h3>English Sales of Extracted Core Precious Eyebrow Tea Are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the local foreign merchants' tea market, Tunxi Gaozhuang precious eyebrow green tea from Baochang, Tongfu, and other firms, and the China Tea Company, have all opened for business, and transactions are still not deserted. However, the market price for famous extracted core goods opened at 155 to 160 taels, 10 to 20 taels lower than previously seen. The selling price of medium and low-grade goods is quite firm. The European sales of other needle eyebrow and pearl tea items are still smooth, but the existing stock is lacking, and there is a shortage in supply.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market for Coarse Granulated Sugar and White Cloth Is Even More Stagnant</h3>
<p>Wufu Ice Has Continued to Arrive</p>
<p>According to yesterday's sugar market area telegram, the current price of Cuban sugar is 1.125, which is down 0.3125 compared to the previous telegram. New York futures for December are 1.02, down 0.02, March of next year is 1.07, up 0.01, May is 1.11, and September is 1.24, all unchanged. There were also no changes in Java futures. Due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange, the public market saw buying interest turn more stagnant, the market price fell, and transactions were quiet. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white was 9.9 mace, and No. 20 medium granulated white was 9.7 mace, with few inquiries. Although there were slightly more transactions of Taikoo sugar, the market was also very chaotic. B Mark fell to 11.7 to 11.65 mace, DY Mark was 11.6 mace, HM Mark was 11.35 mace, HX Mark was 11.55 mace, and the lowest was 11.35 mace. The trend is very weak. Wufu ice has continued to arrive, and the asking price for the original package is 8.8 mace, but there are few takers at the moment, so there have been no transactions.</p>
<h3>Metals: The Tin Market is Extremely Desolate</h3>
<p>Judging from the recent trend, the tin market appears to be stagnant. The price from abroad is not firm, and the situation is unstable, so there are no sales channels. Because of this, the people's hearts are tired, and the standard is sluggish. However, holders have been opening prices cheaper recently, but fewer customers are buying. According to people in the industry, this phenomenon is rarely seen in recent years. Looking at the next step, it is unlikely that there will be a turnaround during this period of financial stress. The current market price is estimated to be 102 taels for Fuzu, 100 taels for Dutch, 94 taels for Xiaohong, 97 taels for sheet tin, and 96 taels for bucket tin.</p>
<h3>Coal: Shanxi Coal New Goods Arrive</h3>
<p>Price Increases by One Tael</p>
<p>Local Shanghai Shanxi white coal has been out of stock for a long time, so the market price has risen. Fellow merchants were very eager for the new goods. Yesterday, they finally arrived, totaling 2,300 tons. 1,000 tons were unloaded at the Xintai Tong Warehouse, and 1,300 tons were unloaded at the Coal Industry Public Warehouse. However, the goods have not yet been put into storage. Fellow merchants heard the news in the afternoon and released their boats to wait for loading. The price has also been opened at 21 taels per ton, which is up by one tael compared to the previous.</p>
