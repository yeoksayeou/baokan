<p>（日内瓦）今晨甫逾十時、國聨行政會忽舉行公開會議辯論請美參加問題、除日本外、各會員皆贊成發出請書、議長白里安乃宣佈請書即將發出、並希望美國接受之、今晨辯論所表示、無人贊同日本對於此事之意見耳、開會之初、白里安立即暢論美國對於滿洲事件與行政會合作事、並追述行政會九月間之討論、謂因此討論之結果、行政會乃决定簽定凱洛格非戰公約之美國應派代表參加行政會、但日總代表芳澤從法律觀念點提出若干異議、日代表在可否享受美國合作之問題上、當然不願與其同志意見相左、惟在其致行政會之函中、舉出若干法律點、行政會已函復之、視其反對基於誤會、行政會在同類案件中、當然可以同樣方式爲之、即邀請一非會員國於必需要時合作是也、請美參加之原則、請書之措詞及法律方面、現公開討論、即此事應視爲取决於行政會多數之手續問題乎、抑爲須得行政會會員全體同意之問題乎云、議長繼宣讀請美國總代表參加行政會之提議文、並謂在討論時、已有人表示意見、以爲行政會所遇之問題、關係不僅由國聨會章且亦由非戰公約而起的義務之執行、此種意見、確有根據、蓋依照非戰公約第二欵、簽約國允將任何性質任何來源之各種爭執與衝突、概用和平方法解决之也、美國爲非戰公約簽字國中之最重要國、其欲以和平方法解决目前爭端也、可認爲特别之注意、且美政府已與國聨互換關於滿洲事件之文件、而表示對於國聨態度之完全同情、及援助國聨橇動之意思、余確信今提議請美政府派代表列座於行政會之議席、實與余之同志志願相合云、芳澤繼起發言頗長、表示所擬辦法之不同意、謂渠甚願人完全明白渠反對請非會員國參加行政會討論提議之動機、因政府以爲此項提議引起關於國聨全部之極重要的組織法問題、渠曾提議將此問題提交法津專家委員會研究之、議長以可否接受此委員會之决定爲問、渠當然不能發肯定之答詞、因行政會如係主體、則其所指派之委員會、不能妨碍行政會之决定也、組織專家委員會之提議乃打銷、行政會旣對此應有之研究、認爲未便進行、渠不得不在原則上投票反對請非會員國參加、其實日本對美國有甚親善之邦交、且尤欽感美政府在現有環境中所抱之友好的與諒解的態度也、國聨會章第四條第五節之適用、意見容或不同、但第十一條則無異議、渠極欲維持其見解、以爲此種問題必須有全體一致之同志、渠所投之反對票、並非政治理由之結果、但起於遠大之成見云、英代表李定發言、對於此乃手續的而非實質的問題一點、加以辯護、謂非請非會員國以會員資格出席於行政會、但爲顧問員資格耳、會章第十一條不適用於此問題問題、惟處理案年曲直時、始適用第十一條、乃有行政會全體一致同意之必要、今所辯論者、非此案曲直、故多數票可矣、尚望日代表以其保留爲滿足、今吾人所處理之一事、極關重要、若失敗、則國聨存在危矣云、芳澤答詞、仍堅持此乃實質的、而非手續的問題、應交法學家委員會研究之說、白里安贊助李定之見解、謂日本從前絶未反對美國之參加、日本之保留、不妨載於行政會議事錄中、渠以爲現可進行對美發出請書事云、其他會員相繼發言、謂中日雙方表示温和、意外相格蘭第稱、手續問題、早已爲九月間行政會以議事情形通告美國之决議所解决矣云、中國代表施肇基申述中國之態度、並請行政會注意於迅速行動之必要、俾依照中政府以和平方法解决各項爭端之政策、而得一解决云、白里安以莊嚴沉着之聲調宣稱、行政會從未片刻不了解其重大之責任、各會員在此皆抱有確信終可得和平解决之精神、吾人今已至應以各方面好意實現和平工作之時期、各國之得保存其榮譽者、即爲和平也、上次戰禍以前、苟有此種機關之存在、則種種驚怖苦　　國聨理事會通過邀請美國列席案洮昂路戰事仍烈法使韋禮敦抵京（見國内要電）法總理賴伐爾啓程赴美（見國外要電）胡漢民發表重要談話（見本埠新聞）</p>

<p>楚、皆可避免云、議長言至此、乃宣佈曰、對美發出請書之决議、除一票外、全塲一致、請書即將發出、余希望可爲美國所接受云、芳澤表示日本之不同意、謂日政府以爲此種决議須全體一致同意、方爲有效云、行政會之公開會議在十二時二十分散會、定今晚六時再開、白里安致美國務卿史汀生之請書、略謂國聨行政會今日已通過余以議長資格提出之下述議案、（中略）是以余依據上述提議、謹發請書致美國政府云云、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）行政院舉行公開會議時、芳澤舉動甚爲失望、大衆以爲日本反對美國參加之意見、當不逾越非公開會議門限、茲芳澤旣已出人意外而出席、又未能安守緘默、殊非白里安及李定爵士預料所及、其、嘗以行政院全體名義向芳澤勸告、其二、則以大不列顛帝國名義請其勿在公開會議表示反對、現已歸於無效、白里安對於國聨會與美國在滿洲事件上所感同一興趣、加以說明、又謂行政院因美國處於特别地位、曾於九月間全體致决定與之交換意見、自茲而後、美國亦嘗鼓勵國聨會俾竟全功、似此國聨會與美國密切合作、實爲必要、芳澤於此竟堅持反對意見、即在白里安歸納討論情形、并聲言發出邀請文之後、亦復如是、波蘭曁巨哥斯拉夫代表贊成多數意見、但聲明昨日議决之件、他日未便視爲先例、德國代表要求雙方當事均以善意維持和平、格蘭第對於日本主張表示反對、西班牙代表聲稱、法理論雖屬重要、而事機迫切、必當以敏捷之行爲出之、美國旣可列席行政院、必能贊助吾人迅速了案、施博士贊成白里安意見、并再度鄭重聲言、中國於簽定非戰條約之後、不復以戰爭爲推行國家政策之手段、會議將終時、白里安宣言稱、吾人當前問題毫未忘却、吾人思慮全在遠東、中日爭端若變而爲戰爭、殊非所可、而以非戰條約言之、此種戰爭極不道德之至、雙方當事雖可熱烈辯論、且可堅决擁護本身利益、但大衆意志均以實現和平爲歸、吾人對於和平業以榮譽爲質、德國代表云、上次大戰之前、各國若能在日内瓦辯論一切、則多數死亡與多數可怖之痛苦、必可避免、余聞是言大爲感動、此次吾人必當有以避免之、吾人今日所行所爲、非爲無益、明日請看吾人維持和平之志願、即可知之云、午後六時公開會議再度舉行、美國代表計可參加、（十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨全體會議辯論請美參加問題時、波蘭代表蘇喀爾起稱、昨日余之投同意票者、因有日本就會章方面之反對、將完全保留之諒解、尤其鑒於九月間開會時、已一致通過將一切文件轉告美國故也、德代表墨蒂厄士稱、理事會此時須由言語而轉入動作時、至今日皆知中日危局、並非囿於一隅之問題、如發生戰爭、全世界將同受其殃、敢請中國與日本鑒於歐戰覆轍、勿堅持其主張、吾人必須放棄舊時代之方法、而解决此爭端、開一智慧與忍耐之先例、意外相格蘭弟與南斯拉夫代表福的樞俱贊成波蘭代表之保留主張、並贊成將理事會原來决議商諸美國、因其未得一致同意也、但宣稱、渠輩皆深信美國在此時列席於理事會、於中國及日本均有大利益、挪威代表向洛德蘭亦贊成波蘭之保留主張、於是中國施總代表乃起請理事會以最迅速之行動、解决中日滿案爭執、渠完全遵守凱洛格公約原則、中國將受僅用和平方法解决爭端之義務所約束、按國聨理事會成立十二年來此次日本之投反對票尚爲第一次、按曩日表决時皆一致通過、否則不投票、以免不能致、故昨日之表决情形、應加以非常重視也、當中國代表致辭畢、西班牙代表麥達利亞加起稱、國聨理事會爲全世界使用道德力量之唯工具、當此國聨絶續存亡最嚴重之時、美國之道德力量、實爲必不可少者、吾輩此時必須有最迅速之行動、不能以法律辯論、虛擲光陰、最後白里安於結束會議時、撮述本日經過、謂理事會今雖有法律之爭點、仍决意解决中日滿洲之糾紛、各理事皆欲於最短時間解决此事、俾可完成吾輩之責任、即在此時、吾輩心中亦無一刻不注念此根本爭執、决不能聽任此糾紛繼續不决、釀成戰爭、在理事會中每造皆有熱烈保衞其權利之權、國聨會章授我詳盡論此項權利之時間、祇須勿空耗光陰可矣、白氏又允日代表要求將日本反對美國之辯論與文件、悉予發表、現理事會定於星期六晚六時續開全體會議討論滿案、（十六日國民電）</p>

<p>祇日代表芳澤投反對票</p>
<p>（日内瓦）理事會今夜以十三票表决請日内瓦美總領事吉爾白列席理事會、討論中日問題、投唯一反對票者祇日代表芳澤、芳澤立即爲此决議、提出措辭强硬之抗議、謂須全體通過方能有效、截至發電時止、吉爾白尚未接受請書、美國大致鑒於日本態度强硬、或將决定不參加理事會、現在形勢胥視日政府是否與芳澤反對一致爲轉移、（十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聨各理事本日之全體會議、五巨·會議與私人接洽對於邀請美國列席一舉、終未能商得日代表同意、不得已遂於夜間全體會議時投票表决、以十三票對一票通過邀請美代表列席旁聽、日代表芳澤仍遵其政府訓令、投不同意票、按理事會此次否决日人之反對主張、實爲國聨成立以來最嚴峻之舉動、據國聨中人宣稱、中國時局嚴重、不得不出此途、冀得世界各大國一致行動以厚實力、聞邀請美代表之列席條件、將以有商榷權爲基礎、即美代表有權自由發表意見、但無表决之權、現邀請書將於明日草擬付會通過發出、今夜理事會共歷三小時、於否决日代表主張後、即行休會、已在夜間九時後、明晨十時將繼續開會、按今晨白里安曾分别與日代表芳澤英代表李定晤談甚久、白氏與芳澤長談一小時、内容聞係就撤兵要求之技術方面、加以討論因認撤兵後便可使中日開始直接外交談判也其與英外相李定所商、亦係滿案問題、今日原定下午三時開五大國會議、倘傍晚日政府對美列席之訓令已到、則舉行全體會議、但白里安與李定會商完畢後、突於正午舉行五大國秘密會議、至下午业時散會旣而東京政府不贊成美國列席之消息抵此間、國聨中人莫不大爲驚震、認時局突然轉劣、此際惟有三種辦法、（一）放棄邀請美國列席意、但不啻直認軟弱、（二）决定邀請美國參加之舉、僅屬一種手續問題、無需各理事一致贊成、因此不必得日本同意斷然邀請、但此舉又將與日本有公然敵對意、（三）對日作若干讓步、易得日方之同意、但又足以失墜國聨之尊嚴、因此五大國政治家急於今日下午四時重開會議討論此事、當時傳聞日代表僅將就法律點、反對美國之參加、又聞芳澤將要求倘美國在理事會接受席後、日本欲理事會轉請美國負擔理事應有之責任、如遵行會章第十欵與第十六欵之規定等、十年來美國之不加入國聨、即爲第十欵之規定、故日本欲假此拒之、至四時三十分五大國會議、乃邀請芳澤加入懇切洽商、據稱、芳澤將要求五大國對於美國參加之法律點、加以詳細說明、然後再提出渠與日政府之主張、迨五大國政治家向芳澤懇切相勸不能奏效後、遂於五時三十分召集全體理事秘密會議、聞白里安李定與各理事之主張、（一）邀請美國參加、僅爲手續問題、無需一致同意票、（二）理事會九月日開會時、曾得日本同意、商定將關於滿洲事件之一切文件分送美政府、故此次請美代表之參加、不過變換方法而已、但日代表芳澤始終堅持一點、即認定非會員國之參加理事會議、不合會章、力稱此舉牽涉根本問題、非僅手續上之事件、於是經白里安李定麥達利亞等三小時之盡力勸說、卒不能動芳澤絲毫、最後主席白里安乃施用外交手段聲稱、倘無人反對、即認爲本會同意於送邀請書與美國矣、蓋欲避免投票手續、顯見日本之不贊成也、詎芳澤答稱、余仍反對、於是遂不得不付諸投票公决、而得前述結果、又聞投票以前、日代表曾動議將此案付法律委員會審查、但僅得德國贊成、卒被放棄、事後芳澤對於理事會表决結果、不允有所討論、但據日代表團中人表示、今後日代表在日内瓦之行動、將完全繫於外務省之新訓令、料幣原外相與若槻首相會商、將開閣議討論此事也、又國聨方面以美國有列席之可能、對於蘇俄倘援酌要求、則將如何應付、亦加以研究、據聞對此業已認定此項要求、其地位與凱洛格公約簽字國之參加國聨種種之活動、及非會員國被邀參加軍縮大會相類似、又承認蘇俄在滿洲亦有鉅大利益云、（十六日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）行政會集議三小時後、今晚卒舉行投票、以决定請美參加所須採之手續問題、但並非請書本身問題、日總代表芳澤獨投票反對此項動議、其他會員皆以爲依照國聨會章第五欵、此事可以多數票决定之、因會章規定手續問題、連指派委員會以調查特殊事件在内、可以行政會會員之多數决之、不須全體一致也、但芳澤則謂渠之觀念與此相反云、議長白里安乃提議請美國以旁聽員資格列</p>

<p>趁曙光尚未守全斷絶。黑暗之恐怖。尚未完全佔領大地之時全世界人民共以最大之努力。挽回可怖之刧運。毋使任何可以爲力之機會。輕易錯過。爲必不可少。蓋今日之問題非僅爲伸一國之寃屈。解一民族之壓迫。而其最大之目的。乃在於伸展全人類共有之公理與正義。消弭迫害全人類安全之危局也。</p>
<p>國聨爲伸展人類共有之公理正義之機關之一國聨行政會今日之召集。即爲不欲放棄其挽回人類末刧之最後機會。吾人認爲除國聨以外。非戰公約與九國協約。都應勿廻避其責任。勿錯過其機會。而尤以九國協約於此時。更適合於行使其神聖之職權。</p>
<p>依據於事實之說明。國聨雖負有處斷聨盟國間糾紛之責任但其性質究較爲廣泛。而一九二二年成立之九國協約。則完全爲保障遠東之和平保障中國之權利而締結。適用此種協約。以處斷協約國之一之日本。今日對中國所施之暴行。與對遠東和平肆意蹂躪背棄信義之行爲。尤爲適合尤爲親切。負荷之偉大責任。在今日亦更顯其重大。截至目前華盛頓。政府。雖已有「參加國聨行政會議」「扶助國聨解决當前之危局」「召集九國協約國公斷是非」之種種傳說但事實上吾人不能不認此種傳說爲太空泛。吾人希望華盛頓政府。此時應毅然起立作有力之發言。</p>
<p>此時而尚不召集九協。約國以公斷是非。解决當前空前之困難。吾人誠不解究將待至何時抑且深惑於九國協約締結之根本意義。以一種暴力之行爲置一民族於生死綫上。爲任何民族所斷難忍受。在此種難以忍受之暴行下。而猶能保持目前未趨於完全絶望之悲慘局面者。則以中國尚竭其全力。忍以維護世界和平靜待正義公斷之故。安全與恐怖之分野。爲期已日益接近。九國協約此時而尚不起而發言。爲其最後之機會而努力。更待何日。日政府極力拒絶美政府之參加國聨。而國聨各代表。仍毅然一致通過參加之請。則各代表之盼望美政府之援助。可謂殷切矣。美政府於此時機。一方正宜急起參加。作大聲有效處置之發言。一方則更倡召集九協約國之議。以正義制裁暴日。庶乎日人不能再有所推諉。不能再以非會員國視美。而不絶如縷之和平一線生機。或可有救。</p>

<p>自由談痛心的話  鵑　　親愛的國人。此次暴日入寇。我們的不抵抗主義。雖巳騰笑世界。然而尚不失其當唾面自乾的君子。不過太懦怯。太没用。太不合現代的潮流罷了。至於暴日的不講理主義。也已昭昭在人耳目。爲世界所共見共聞。任是如何掩飾。總也掩飾不了。瞧他們的所爲。簡直是流氓無賴惡霸强盜的所爲。而又像是智識的蠻人。無理性的野獸。事到如今。我們似乎已不能用公理人道來制裁這蠻人與野獸。須憑我們一般血性的好男兒。振作起勇氣。共同去打倒它。殲除它。不除庭艸齋夫談薈蠶之告狀　　上帝啊上帝！您爲什麽造我，功成而見棄？您爲什麽造人，以我爲奴隷？人心實殘暴，嘴裏講仁義。圖我護身繭，性命遭他忌。火烘得枯乾；水煑得筆直；遇着好吃精，活活炒來下酒吃。一件綢衣一萬命，漂亮背後是血跡。蠶婦没得綺羅穿，報應也似有天意。罪魁中與日，附逆的是法蘭西，意大利。科學聖人巴士德，偷進蠶國做奸細。自從他出世，殺蠶放火等兒戲。不問好和壞，生了兒女，媽媽得槍斃。的的媽媽被槍斃！我的奶奶被槍斃！我的姊姊也要被槍斃！不知道槍斃了幾萬億！還說，我是蠶頭，一點不客氣。也怪我好吃他的桑葉，而不能自立。何如勸人穿棉衣？打倒絲羅却不易。絲羅打倒不養蠶，吾類絶種没多日。思來想去無路走，只有求上帝：吐絲吃桑葉，呌人替一替。我願披素絹，好向祖宗祭。若是辦不到，給我一些力！給我一些力，保種制仇敵。如果弱肉强食老不管，小蟲問：「爲什麽還要上帝？」紀台灣抗日始末  伊蘭　　甲午之役。我軍敗績。次年即有所謂馬關條約。割台灣屬日。警耗傳播。全台震動。台民丘仙根。憤激尤甚。曰。朝廷旣棄台民。台民决不自棄。乃首倡自主抗日之議。振臂一呼。全台皆應。血性之倫。不期而會者數萬人。齊詣撫轅。合辭請願。并戴巡撫唐景崧爲義勇團大總統。主持軍政。景崧固辭不獲。遂衣冠升堂。望闕叩首。而後南面受任。禮畢。大哭。衆亦哭。即改撫署爲總統府。電告北京。聲言自主。并云遥奉正朔。永作屏藩。部署旣定。設官分職。略具規模。顧台灣區區一島。孤懸海外。内而無餉。外而無援其不能持久。固意中事。然台民並不以此氣餒。協力同心。益加奮勉。不數日。日兵大至。舍舟登陸。逕趨基隆。其勢張甚。守將吳國華奮勇迎擊。大勝。嗣因營弁爭功互鬭。日兵乃乘間奪三貂嶺。基隆危殆。景崧聞訊。立命公統李某馳援。復遣黄某助戰。二人均　冗。聞日兵勢盛。逗遛不前。於是基隆遂爲日兵唾手而得。基隆旣陷。門户大闢。無險可據。益以兵不聽命。紛紛折回。叢集省垣。索餉鼓譟。景崧不能禁。自後潰兵愈多。恣意淫掠。軍民互鬨。積尸盈市。中軍護勇。又復暗爲内應。景崧知不可爲。乃微服雜難民中内渡。景崧旣如。丘仙根急舉鄉勇。冀挽救於萬一。佈置未定。日兵已薄城下。不得已。遁走福建。時提督劉永福尚守台南。日兵圍攻數月不下。奈食盡援絶。未幾亦失守。此自主之台灣。雖如曇花一現。然台民不願爲亡國奴。明知不可抗而故抗之。其精神自不可磨滅。吾國人對之。當有愧色矣。點滴  寄萍　　我至今還時刻紀念着去年防俄之役爲國捐軀的韓光第將軍，他最值得我國民崇拜的是：不畏强敵，捍衞國土·寗可粉身碎骨·不讓强鄰入寇：他眞當得起中華民國的軍人！韓烈士死了·他的舊部，改由于兆麟統率，于氏近又遵奉所謂「不抵抗主義，」而下令退出黑龍江，韓將軍舊部五千健兒，激於愛國的義憤，奮不顧身，誓與賣國奴張海鵬軍拚命，結果能暫時保持黑省垣土地的完整，（但一說龍江失守，已爲張賊所據。）像這支部隊的勇氣與愛國精神，值得我人歌頌。獨不解東北當局斷送了遼吉兩省土地，還要令于部無抵抗的退出黑省，把三省完全拱手讓人，究屬是何居心？塵因記  徐碧波　　傷時生挾一技之長。欲貢獻於國家。顧國家對於槃槃大材。乏安置處者無慮千萬。濟濟多士。充滿於如此國家。猗歟盛哉。生鬱鬱歸。因以醫國之志習醫病。醫幟旣張。業乃鼎盛。璅屑之事。亦隨之而生。我文本不限於述生一己事。不妨帝及其他。曼茵姑娘芳華己及䈂。蟄處深閨。春意闌珊。偶閱日報。覯及生之告白。忽發奇想。遂慵妝而假病。延生診察。生切脈己訝其無病。草草立方去。次日醫室之電匣大鳴。生即聽之。鶯聲嚦嚦。辨爲女子音吐。問誰何。又作吃吃笑。醫不耐。懸斷耳機。又次日。候診室中。突來一丰姿姚冶之女郎。烙髮成螺旋形。錦衣蠻鞵。芳麝四溢。司號者疑此女誤診所爲舞塲也。訝訊之。女微笑。且擲倍金以占頭籌。未幾門闢。女珊珊入。靈波注及生面。作娟笑。神光射處。幾可麻醉聖人之魂。生問何所苦。女答無所苦。所苦者。不能得醫生之心耳。生錯會其旨。因脫口曰。諺云醫者有割股之心。脫能犧牲醫者一己而造福於病家。固爲初願所持。……女以爲語妙雙關。樂極。逕將柔腕環生頸。並以熱吻親其頣。醫窘。亟掣鈴喚臧獲至曰。此姑娘所患係神經系症。善護之登車去。女無奈退。瀕行猶報以秋波一轉。顧此靈光中。已易媚笑爲怨瞋矣。人咸謂世惟醫生之心最慈。亦惟醫生之心最忍。於此乃成信讞。一日生應S埠之召。乘火車東下。經N鎭。入一革靴銅紐。帽綴鷹徽之人。後隨二灰衣健者。手執短銃。環腰皆鉛珠。若經爆發。爲勢可炸盡全廂之乘客。顧廂位太半爲平頂翁所據。御制服者。執鉗在手。不敢向索車劵。惟於平民堆中盡其越級補益之能事。一灰衣人頻頻向其同類善言取閱信證。或出不相干之函件。或竟直言無之。二灰衣人以彼輩數衆。婉言及於國難。亦置不理。一客大弗耐。因微嘆誦「國家將亡。必有妖孽。」句以洩其不平之氣。顧爲聲至低。恐被若輩聞而將飽以老拳也。時生閱日報。見硃書日本兵侵入遼省後之暴行。血液盡沸。正怒眦欲裂之際。忽聞高聲起於廂内。蓋平頂翁不堪灰衣人之縟擾。勢將動武矣。醫以醫人之使命綦重。因首先凂避。經一洗盥室。則門框上方方高懸一司令誥誡軍人不得無票搭車之告示。私念若輩竟敢藐視軍令。厥罪大矣。益以適方悲故都聞見錄  銖菴　　嚴嵩書榜　　店肆喜乞達官貴人書扁額字。其習自古有之。光宣之間。多魯人王垿所書。當時有有扁皆書垿無腔不學譚之諺。民國初年猶然。近始稍絶迹。王書實不佳。蓋北都商肆多魯人。徒以鄉誼爲重耳。惟店肆之極舊者。尚保存嚴嵩書額。實爲可觀。分宜榜書結體綿密。用筆峻整。絶不矜奇弔詭。而人自莫能勝。正昔人所謂作大字如小字者。如今之景山北上門額。大石作大高殿東西牌坊。一孔綏皇祚。二弘估天民。三太極僊林。四先天明境。草廠七條胡同袁州館之帝晨春臺額。前門糧食店六必居額。後門大街之仁一堂額。菜市口之鶴年堂額。及用收赤箭青芝品製式靈樞玉板篇楹聨。（或謂此二者其子東樓書）皆昭昭在人耳目者。他如鐵柱宫之淨明思孝四大字。書之廳壁。尤見筆勢。其佚者則翰林院之丹林森嚴額。貢院之至公堂三字。（乾隆時屢書以易皆不及仍用原額。）禮部之夙夜匪懈額。西城兵馬司之大德顯靈宫石額。最近毁棄者爲西單牌樓北大街路西雙復染坊之雙復二字。燈市口煤舖壁上之價重烏金而火恒八字。俗人不知寳貴。輕易擦去。良可惜也。六必居及鶴年堂肆主。頗知寳愛嚴書。不輕出以示人。聞有出價至三萬元者。諒此二肆全恃此古舊之市招爲營業廣告。非重金所能易也。琉璃與隆福寺諸書店榜額亦多名手所書。則多在道咸以後矣。國之鬱怒遂縱聲而哭。哭國亡之無日。一茶役見之。笑謂同儕曰。速至厠所門前。觀一發瘋之少年去。（酬金助振）無線電界之救國方法  鳳　　國事蜩螗。民生凋敝之際。東北突以被日侵佔聞。上海首得驚耗。以傳告於各通信社各報館者。爲國際電信局局長陸桂祥、而賴以轉告於各國者。則純爲眞茹國際無線電台。（按是台之創議擘畫。以觀厥成之人。爲前交通大學電學敎授王崇植氏。王氏感於濟案時。國外新聞消息。率爲日人混淆。致乏國際宣傳之效。故力主無線電台之設立。）良以無線電報。消息迅速。數分鐘間即可遍播於全球。而敵人無策阻撓之也。但查我國各地無線電台之建設。尚寥如晨星。欲救短期間全國有臂指之聨絡。勢非政府一時所能爲力。勢必聨合國内業餘無線電研究者。共同救濟。始克完成吾國無線電網之計劃。所幸比年卓識之士。羣起研習。其所經營。亦頗成績斐然。當此存亡呼吸之秋。孰不願奮然蹶起。盡力報國。茲有無線電專家方子衞。已自動發起全國業餘無線電聨合會。冀國内無線電家。互相聨絡。一方傳遞消息。調查實情。以助政府之參考。一方使暴日行爲。纖悉畢陳於國人之前。同時並可切磋研磨無線電學術。冀更有所發明。現在已有你少響應共謀進行之策。一俟綱舉章備後。即正式成立。協助黨國。此足徵無線電界諸志上爲國努力服務之先聲也。短訊  燕子　　自日本侵佔遼吉以後。凡我同胞。莫不髮指。寓滬畫家多半隷中日同志會。自經國難。咸告脫離。賀天健孫雪泥鄭午昌謝公展熊松泉等尤爲激烈。乃約張善孖錢瘦鐵馬企周閻甘園馬孟容王師子葉渭莘李祖韓等。特組中國畫會。一致抗日。舉天健午昌起草。於雙十節假冠生園開成立會。當場推舉張善孖孫雪泥鄭午昌錢門鐵陸甘林賀天健馬企周等七人。爲籌備委員。次多數熊松泉李祖韓王師子爲候補委員。張善孖因母病請熊松泉代表。七時散會。又孫雪泥君素具熱忱。此次憤倭奴之暴行。乃有抗日日歷之發行。書圖悉由田清泉揮翰。而儷以賀天健之撰句。見之令人驚心動目。定購者已絡繹不絶云。說部扶輪會敲夢的桁（一五）  程瞻廬　　受着過去時代化的陶遲，昏昏沈沈的在京華度了多年；他的官階愈高，他　的智識却愈低了！忽的他在睡夢之中，丨也許是在清醒之中丨瞧見世界婦女在廣塲中舉行長距離的賽跑，他的纖足夫人也　在其内，幾乎成了一隻没脚蟹！人家飛也似的去了，他的纖足夫人却是扭揑揑摇摇擺擺踏殺螞蟻似的在廣塲上行走：人家八百碼賽跑已達得了目的地，他的纖足夫人却是氣喘吁吁粉汗淫淫跑不上三碼兩碼的路，吃那周圍觀衆指指點點的向着伊笑。陶遲覺悟了！覺悟這許多賽跑婦女的脚，才算是脚；他的纖足夫人的脚，簡直不是脚；只不過比着别去雙足的稍勝一籌。忽的，有人拍着陶遲的肩，回頭看時，却是早已身亡而自己忘却他化爲異物的裴時。學友相逢，便在這裏班荆道故；恍惚裴時已得了機械學博士的學位，而成爲科學世界的重要人物。但是，裴時和他談那機械的原理和應用，他竟是趕麵杖做吹火管，變做了一竅不通。陶遲又覺悟自己所有的會試硃卷殿試對策這一類東西，除却抺桌子，生火爐以外，再也没有更切實的應用！若論學問，只有裴時所研究的機械學才是眞正的學問。　　陶遲在睡夢中，忽的，放聲大哭！引起他同衾共枕的人的驚疑，而欲知其究竟。　　陶遲漸漸的醒了，丨也許又入夢境了丨拭抹着倦眼，經他夫人唐秀英把他連連摇撼以後。　　「奇哉！怪哉！」他周視着臥榻左右，且視且說。</p>

The cable stated that the invitation was approved by the Council. During the Council's discussion of the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute, opinions were expressed that the case involved the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations Charter. Article II of the Kellogg-Briand Pact stipulates that international disputes can only be resolved peacefully, so this view is entirely justified. The United States, as a party to resolving disputes peacefully and as one of the first signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, can be said to pay particular attention to achieving a peaceful resolution of disputes. Now is the time when the goodwill and willingness of all signatory countries to mediate disputes must be demonstrated. We are determined to maintain peace as the foundation of the League of Nations. We welcome the remarks of the German representative, Motitius, that if the League of Nations had been established before the European War, allowing all parties to sit down at a table for lengthy discussions, the catastrophe could have been avoided. Now that we have this organization, we must strive for its success in the future. We must express our sincere actions, etc. After the Council passed the invitation, it adjourned. The Japanese representative still expressed opposition. The Council is scheduled to reconvene at 6:00 PM tonight. Members of the League of Nations hope that the US representative, Gilbert, will be able to attend the meeting at that time. (Sixteenth, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Executive Council of the League of Nations Held Public Meeting Yesterday Morning <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Debating the Issue of Inviting the United States to Participate</p>
<p>(Geneva) Just after 10:00 AM this morning, the Executive Council of the League of Nations suddenly held a public meeting to debate the issue of inviting the United States to participate. With the exception of Japan, all members supported issuing the invitation. Chairman Briand announced that the invitation would be issued immediately and hoped that the United States would accept it. No one expressed support for Japan's opinion on this matter in this morning's debate. At the beginning of the meeting, Briand immediately spoke at length about the cooperation between the United States and the Executive Council on the Manchurian incident, and reviewed the Executive Council's discussions in September, stating that as a result of these discussions, the Executive Council decided that the United States, which had signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, should send a representative to participate in the Executive Council. However, Japanese Chief Delegate Yoshizawa raised some objections from a legal point of view. On the issue of whether or not to enjoy American cooperation, the Japanese representative naturally did not want to disagree with his colleagues. However, in his letter to the Executive Council, he raised some legal points. The Executive Council has responded to the letter, viewing his opposition as based on misunderstanding. In similar cases, the Executive Council can naturally do the same, that is, invite a non-member state to cooperate when necessary. The principle of inviting the United States to participate, the wording of the invitation, and the legal aspects are now being openly discussed. Is this matter to be regarded as a procedural matter to be decided by a majority of the Executive Council, or as a matter that requires the unanimous consent of all members of the Executive Council? The Chairman then read out the proposed text of the invitation to the US representative to participate in the Executive Council, and said that during the discussion, some people expressed the opinion that the problem encountered by the Executive Council was related not only to the League of Nations Charter but also to the execution of obligations arising from the Pact of Paris. This view is certainly based on the fact that, according to Article II of the Pact of Paris, the signatory countries agree to resolve all disputes and conflicts of any nature or origin by peaceful means. The United States is the most important country among the signatories to the Pact of Paris, and its desire to resolve the current dispute by peaceful means can be regarded as particularly noteworthy. Moreover, the US government has exchanged documents with the League of Nations regarding the Manchurian incident, expressing complete sympathy for the League of Nations' attitude and a willingness to assist the League of Nations' efforts. I am convinced that the proposal to invite the US government to send a representative to sit on the Executive Council is in line with the wishes of my colleagues. Yoshizawa then took the floor and spoke at length, expressing his disagreement with the proposed method, saying that he very much wanted people to fully understand his motivation for opposing the invitation of non-member states to participate in the Executive Council, because the government believed that this proposal raised extremely important organizational law issues concerning the entire League of Nations. He had proposed that this issue be submitted to a committee of legal experts for research. The Chairman asked whether he could accept the decision of this committee. He certainly could not give an affirmative answer, because if the Executive Council was the main body, then the committee it appointed could not hinder the decision of the Executive Council. The proposal to organize a committee of experts was rejected. Since the Executive Council considered it inappropriate to conduct the necessary research on this matter, he had no choice but to vote against the participation of non-member states in principle. In fact, Japan has very friendly relations with the United States and especially admires the friendly and understanding attitude of the US government in the current environment. Opinions may differ on the application of Article IV, paragraph 5 of the League of Nations Charter, but there is no disagreement on Article XI. He very much wants to maintain his view that such issues must have unanimous agreement from his colleagues. His negative vote was not the result of political reasons, but originated from far-reaching prejudices. British representative Reading spoke, defending the point that this was a procedural rather than a substantive issue, saying that non-member states were not being invited to attend the Executive Council as members, but as advisors. Article XI of the Charter does not apply to this issue. Article XI only applies when dealing with the merits of the case. Therefore, it is necessary for the entire Executive Council to agree unanimously. What is being debated now is not the merits of this case, so a majority vote is sufficient. It is hoped that the Japanese representative will be satisfied with his reservations. What we are dealing with today is extremely important. If it fails, the existence of the League of Nations is in danger. Yoshizawa replied, still insisting that this was a substantive rather than a procedural issue and should be submitted to a committee of jurists for research. Briand supported Reading's view, saying that Japan had never previously opposed the participation of the United States. Japan's reservation could be recorded in the minutes of the Executive Council. He believed that the matter of issuing an invitation to the United States could now proceed. Other members spoke in succession, saying that both China and Japan had expressed moderation and unexpected differences. Grandi said that the procedural issue had already been resolved by the Executive Council's decision in September to inform the United States of the situation. Chinese representative Shih Chao-chi stated China's attitude and asked the Executive Council to pay attention to the necessity of quick action in order to obtain a resolution in accordance with the Chinese government's policy of resolving all disputes by peaceful means. Briand declared in a solemn and calm tone that the Executive Council had never for a moment been unaware of its great responsibility. All members here are confident that a peaceful solution can be obtained. We have now reached the time when the good intentions of all parties should be used to realize peace work. The countries that preserve their honor are those that preserve peace. Before the last war, if this kind of organization had existed, then all kinds of terror and suffering could have been avoided. When the Chairman said this, he announced that the resolution to issue an invitation to the United States was unanimously approved by the entire room except for one vote. The invitation will be issued immediately, and I hope it will be accepted by the United States. Yoshizawa expressed Japan's disagreement, saying that the Japanese government believed that this kind of resolution had to be unanimously approved to be valid. The public meeting of the Executive Council adjourned at 12:20 PM and was scheduled to reconvene at 6:00 PM tonight. Briand's letter to US Secretary of State Stimson stated briefly that the Executive Council of the League of Nations had today passed the following motion that I proposed in my capacity as Chairman, (omission) Therefore, based on the above proposal, I hereby issue an invitation to the US government. (Sixteenth, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) During the public meeting of the Executive Yuan, Yoshizawa's actions were very disappointing. The public believed that Japan's opposition to the United States' participation would not exceed the limits of a non-public meeting. Now that Yoshizawa had unexpectedly attended and failed to remain silent, it was beyond the expectations of Briand and Sir Reading. First, they tried to persuade Yoshizawa in the name of the entire Executive Yuan. Second, they asked him not to express opposition in a public meeting in the name of the British Empire, but now it has been to no avail. Briand explained that the League of Nations and the United States felt the same interest in the Manchurian incident, and also said that the Executive Yuan had unanimously decided to exchange views with the United States in September because of the United States' special position. Since then, the United States has also encouraged the League of Nations to achieve complete success. It seems that close cooperation between the League of Nations and the United States is necessary. Yoshizawa insisted on his opposition opinion here, even after Briand summarized the discussion situation and declared the issuance of an invitation. Representatives of Poland and Yugoslavia supported the majority opinion, but stated that the decision made yesterday should not be regarded as a precedent in the future. The German representative asked both parties to maintain peace in good faith. Grandi expressed his opposition to Japan's claims. The Spanish representative stated that although legal theory was important, the situation was urgent and must be dealt with with prompt action. Now that the United States can attend the Executive Yuan, it will definitely help us to quickly resolve the case. Dr. Shih supported Briand's opinion and reiterated solemnly that China would no longer use war as a means of pursuing national policy after signing the Pact of Paris. At the end of the meeting, Briand declared that we have not forgotten the problem before us, and our thoughts are all in the Far East. If the Sino-Japanese dispute turns into war, it is absolutely not acceptable. In terms of the Pact of Paris, this kind of war is extremely immoral. Although both parties can debate fiercely and firmly defend their own interests, the will of the public is to achieve peace. We have already pledged our honor to peace. The German representative said that if all countries could have debated everything in Geneva before the last war, most of the deaths and most of the terrible suffering could have been avoided. I was greatly moved by these words. This time we must have a way to avoid it. What we do today is not useless. Tomorrow, you can see our will to maintain peace. The public meeting will be held again at 6:00 PM in the afternoon, and the US representative is expected to attend. (Sixteenth, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the plenary meeting debated the issue of inviting the United States to participate this morning, Polish representative Sokal took the floor and said that my affirmative vote yesterday was based on a complete understanding of Japan's opposition on the aspect of the Charter, especially given the fact that it had unanimously passed the resolution to transfer all documents to the United States when the meeting was held in September. German representative Mottiers said that the Council must now move from words to actions. Today, everyone knows that the Sino-Japanese crisis is not a problem confined to one corner. If war breaks out, the whole world will suffer. I dare to ask China and Japan to learn from the European War and not insist on their claims. We must abandon the methods of the old era and resolve this dispute, setting a precedent for wisdom and patience. Unexpectedly, Grandi and Yugoslav representative Fotixu both supported the Polish representative's reservation claim and supported the consultation with the United States on the Council's original resolution, because it did not obtain unanimous consent. But they declared that they all deeply believed that the United States' attendance at the Council at this time would be of great benefit to both China and Japan. Norwegian representative to Rockland also supported Poland's reservation claim. Then Chinese Chief Representative Shi Chao-chi asked the Council to resolve the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute with the most rapid action. He fully complied with the principles of the Kellogg Pact, and China will be bound by the obligation to resolve disputes by peaceful means only. According to the Council of the League of Nations, Japan's negative vote was the first time in the twelve years since its establishment. According to the past, the vote was always passed unanimously, otherwise no vote would be cast to avoid failure. Therefore, the voting situation yesterday should be taken very seriously. When the Chinese representative finished his speech, Spanish representative Madariaga took the floor and said that the Council of the League of Nations is the only tool in the world to use moral force. At this most serious time for the life and death of the League of Nations, the moral force of the United States is absolutely indispensable. We must have the most rapid action at this time and cannot waste time with legal debates. Finally, Briand summarized the day's proceedings at the end of the meeting, saying that although the Council now has legal disputes, it is still determined to resolve the Sino-Japanese Manchurian dispute. All Council members want to resolve this matter in the shortest possible time so that we can fulfill our responsibilities, that is, at this time, we will not for a moment fail to pay attention to this fundamental dispute, and we must not allow this dispute to continue unresolved, leading to war. Every creation in the Council has the right to defend its rights warmly, and the Charter of the League of Nations gives me the time to discuss this right in detail, as long as we do not waste time. Briand also promised to publish the Japanese opposition to the United States and the documents in their entirety. The Council is now scheduled to hold a plenary meeting at 6:00 PM on Saturday to discuss the Manchurian case. (Sixteenth, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e4">League of Nations Voted to Invite the United States to Attend <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Only Japanese representative Yoshizawa Voted Against</p>
<p>(Geneva) Tonight, the Council voted by thirteen votes to invite Geneva's US Consul General Gilbert to attend the Council meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese problem. The only negative vote was cast by Japanese representative Yoshizawa. Yoshizawa immediately lodged a strong protest against this resolution, saying that it would only be valid if it was unanimously passed. As of the time of the telegram, Gilbert had not accepted the invitation. The United States is likely to decide not to participate in the Council, largely because of Japan's tough attitude. The current situation depends on whether the Japanese government is consistent with Yoshizawa's opposition. (Sixteenth, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The collective meeting, the Five Powers Conference, and private contacts of the League of Nations Council members today failed to reach an agreement with the Japanese representative on inviting the United States to attend. As a last resort, a vote was taken at the plenary meeting at night, and the invitation to the US representative to attend as an observer was passed by a vote of thirteen to one. Japanese representative Yoshizawa still followed the instructions of his government and cast a negative vote. According to the League of Nations, the Council's rejection of the Japanese opposition was the most severe action since the establishment of the League of Nations. According to members of the League of Nations, the Chinese situation is serious and they have to take this approach in order to obtain the concerted action of the world's major powers to strengthen their strength. It is heard that the terms of inviting the US representative to attend will be based on the right to discuss, that is, the US representative has the right to freely express opinions, but does not have the right to vote. The invitation will be drafted and passed by the Council tomorrow and issued. The Council lasted for three hours tonight. After rejecting the Japanese representative's proposal, it adjourned. It was after 9:00 PM at night. It will continue to meet at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning. According to reports, Briand had lengthy meetings with Japanese representative Yoshizawa and British representative Reading today. Briand talked with Yoshizawa for an hour. The content was heard to be a discussion of the technical aspects of the troop withdrawal request, because it was believed that a troop withdrawal would allow China and Japan to begin direct diplomatic negotiations. His consultation with British Foreign Minister Reading was also about the Manchurian case. Today, the Five Powers Conference was originally scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. If the Japanese government's instructions on the US attendance had arrived by evening, a plenary meeting would be held. However, after Briand and Reading finished their consultation, they suddenly held a secret meeting of the Five Powers at noon, which broke up at noon in the afternoon. When the news that the Tokyo government did not approve of the US attendance arrived here, members of the League of Nations were greatly shocked, believing that the situation had suddenly turned bad. At this time, there were only three solutions: (1) Abandon the intention to invite the United States to attend, which is tantamount to admitting weakness; (2) Decide that the invitation to the United States to participate is only a procedural matter, and there is no need for the unanimous approval of each Council member. Therefore, invite without hesitation without obtaining Japan's consent, but this move will be in open hostility to Japan; (3) Make some concessions to Japan to make it easier to obtain Japan's consent, but it will be enough to lose the dignity of the League of Nations. Therefore, the politicians of the Five Powers were anxious to reconvene the meeting at 4:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the matter. At that time, it was rumored that the Japanese representative would only oppose the United States' participation on legal grounds, and it was also heard that Yoshizawa would request that if the United States accepted a seat on the Council, Japan would want the Council to transfer the request to the United States to bear the responsibilities that a Council member should have, such as complying with the provisions of Article X and Article XVI of the Charter. The fact that the United States has not joined the League of Nations for ten years is the provision of Article X, so Japan wants to use this to reject it. At 4:30 PM, the Five Powers Conference invited Yoshizawa to join the earnest consultation. It is claimed that Yoshizawa will request the Five Powers to give a detailed explanation of the legal points of the United States' participation, and then put forward his and the Japanese government's claims. After the politicians of the Five Powers earnestly persuaded Yoshizawa to no avail, they convened a secret meeting of all Council members at 5:30 PM. It was heard that Briand, Reading, and the claims of the Council members were: (1) Inviting the United States to participate is only a procedural matter and does not require unanimous votes; (2) The Council had obtained Japan's consent at the meeting held in September to send all documents regarding the Manchurian incident to the US government, so the participation of the US representative this time is only a change of method. However, Japanese representative Yoshizawa insisted on one point, that is, he recognized that the participation of non-member states in the Council meeting did not comply with the Charter, and strenuously claimed that this move involved fundamental issues, not just procedural events. Therefore, after Briand, Reading, Madariaga, and others tried their best to persuade for three hours, they could not move Yoshizawa in the slightest. Finally, Chairman Briand used diplomatic means to claim that if no one opposed it, the meeting would be deemed to have agreed to send an invitation to the United States, in order to avoid the voting procedure, which clearly showed Japan's disapproval. Yoshizawa replied that he still opposed it, so he had no choice but to put it to a vote and get the aforementioned result. It was also heard that before the vote, the Japanese representative had moved to submit the case to the Legal Committee for review, but only Germany supported it and was finally abandoned. Afterwards, Yoshizawa refused to discuss the results of the Council's vote, but according to people in the Japanese delegation, the actions of the Japanese representative in Geneva in the future will be completely tied to the new instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is expected that Foreign Minister Shidehara and Prime Minister Wakatsuki will meet and discuss the matter at a cabinet meeting. In addition, the League of Nations also studied how to deal with the Soviet Union if it requested assistance and consideration given the possibility of the United States attending. It is heard that this requirement has been recognized as similar to the participation of the Kellogg Pact signatory countries in various activities of the League of Nations and the invitation of non-member states to participate in the Disarmament Conference, and it also recognizes that the Soviet Union also has huge interests in Manchuria. (Sixteenth, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the Executive Council meeting for three hours, it finally voted tonight to decide on the procedures required for the US participation, but it was not the issue of the invitation itself. Japanese Chief Delegate Yoshizawa voted against this motion alone. Other members believed that according to Article V of the League of Nations Charter, this matter could be decided by a majority vote, because the Charter stipulates that procedural matters, including the appointment of committees to investigate special events, can be decided by a majority of the members of the Executive Council without unanimous consent. However, Yoshizawa said that his view was contrary to this. Chairman Briand then proposed to invite the United States to attend the Executive Council meeting as an observer.</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Responsibility of the Nine-Power Treaty to Maintain Peace in the Far East <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Council of the League of Nations has been reconvened. Now another four days have passed. Regarding the dangerous situation created by the situation in the Northeast, there are still no concrete results that can break the dangerous situation in front of the world. The Japanese army's bombing of Jinzhou and advancing on Shanhaiguan, cutting off the Beining Road, and various increasingly tyrannical acts have made the situation in the Far East even more dangerous. Since the reconvening of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, we have experienced a long four centuries with eager expectations in these short four days. We deeply know that the Executive Council of the League of Nations has a very short session, but in this short period of time, the direction of the fate of the entire world and all mankind will be determined, and a boundary line will be drawn between the new and old centuries. It is not just the Chinese people. I dare to assert that the people of any country who care about the future destiny of all mankind must have such anxieties.</p>
<p>While the dawn has not yet been completely cut off and the horror of darkness has not completely occupied the earth, the people of the world must make the greatest efforts to reverse the terrible catastrophe and must not lightly miss any opportunity to do what they can. Because today's problem is not just about extending a country's grievances and relieving a nation's oppression, but its greatest purpose is to extend the common justice and righteousness of all mankind and eliminate the dangerous situation that persecutes the safety of all mankind.</p>
<p>The League of Nations is one of the institutions for extending the common justice and righteousness of mankind. The convening of the Executive Council of the League of Nations today is to avoid giving up its last chance to reverse the end of mankind. We believe that in addition to the League of Nations, the Pact of Paris and the Nine-Power Treaty should not avoid their responsibilities or miss their opportunities. In particular, the Nine-Power Treaty is more suitable for exercising its sacred powers at this time.</p>
<p>Based on the explanation of the facts, although the League of Nations has the responsibility to adjudicate disputes between allied countries, its nature is relatively broad. The Nine-Power Treaty, which was established in 1922, was completely concluded to guarantee peace in the Far East and protect China's rights. It is particularly appropriate and more relevant to apply this treaty to adjudicate the tyrannical acts committed by Japan, one of the treaty countries, against China today, and the acts of wantonly trampling on peace in the Far East and betraying its credibility. The great responsibility it bears is even more significant today. So far, although the Washington government has had various rumors of "participating in the Executive Council of the League of Nations," "assisting the League of Nations in resolving the current crisis," and "calling on the Nine-Power Treaty countries to judge right and wrong," we cannot but recognize that these rumors are too broad. We hope that the Washington government will stand up resolutely at this time and make a powerful statement.</p>
<p>If the Nine-Power Treaty is not convened at this time to adjudicate right and wrong and resolve the current unprecedented difficulties, we sincerely do not understand when we will wait until, and we are deeply confused about the fundamental significance of the conclusion of the Nine-Power Treaty. Placing a nation on the line of life and death with a violent act is something that no nation can tolerate. Under this kind of unbearable tyrannical act, what can still maintain the current tragic situation that has not tended to complete despair is that China is still doing its best to endure and maintain world peace and wait for a just judgment. The division between safety and terror is getting closer and closer. If the Nine-Power Treaty does not stand up and speak out at this time and strive for its last opportunity, what day will we wait for? The Japanese government has tried its best to reject the US government's participation in the League of Nations, but the representatives of the League of Nations still resolutely and unanimously passed the invitation to participate, which shows that the representatives' hope for the assistance of the US government can be said to be eager. At this time, the US government should immediately participate and make a loud and effective statement, and on the other hand, it should advocate convening the Nine-Power Treaty countries to sanction the tyrannical Japan with justice. Perhaps the Japanese will no longer be able to shirk their responsibility and will no longer regard the United States as a non-member country, and perhaps the line of hope for peace that is about to be cut off can be saved.</p>

<p>At the Executive Council meeting, a request was made to issue a letter of invitation to attend the meeting, and Yoshizawa opposed the proposal, saying that it was not only a procedural issue but also a substantive issue. British Foreign Minister Reading refuted this, saying that this proposal was indeed a procedural issue, not a substantive issue, because there was no issue of making the US observer a member of the Executive Council. Yoshizawa then suggested organizing a committee of jurists to study the matter, and Briand asked him whether Japan was prepared to abide by the decision of this committee. The Yoshizawa suggestion was overturned and was not passed. As a result, the Executive Council unanimously voted in principle to issue an invitation to the United States, except for Japan, which did not approve it alone. A draft was immediately drawn up, and the original draft will be slightly modified and sent tomorrow. It is heard that the observer proposed by the Executive Council has the opportunity to speak at the Executive Council meeting. (Fifteenth, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A public statement was issued tonight to announce the results of today's Executive Council meeting, and said that during the Executive Council's debate, some members expressed the opinion that the dispute between China and Japan was related not only to the execution of the obligations of the League of Nations Charter, but also to the execution of the obligations of the Paris Pact initiated by the United States.

According to travelers, the train was detained by the Japanese army at Huanggu Village for 20 hours because the Japanese secretly aided the bandit Xiao Bailong with a large number of guns and bullets, ordering him to harass everywhere, and the Japanese took the opportunity to send troops to occupy the territory. Unexpectedly, after Xiao Bailong received the weapons and ammunition from the Japanese, he immediately turned against the Japanese army and launched an offensive against the Japanese army's location. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered many casualties. The telegram yesterday reported that a large number of bandits were found in Baqibao, which is Xiao Bailong's troops. The Japanese army was filled with remorse and sent five troop trains to suppress them. When the Japanese soldiers arrived, Xiao Bailong slightly maneuvered and retreated into the deep mountains.

<p>Manila: The Chinese Chamber of Commerce here, representing 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, today sent a telegram to U.S. President Hoover, Secretary of State Stimson, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Borah, and former Philippine Governor-General Forbes, who is currently on leave as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, stating that the 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines respectfully request that your government, for the sake of justice, humanity, and world peace, rise up to stop Japan's continued aggression in Manchuria. If war breaks out, tens of millions of Chinese victims will all become starving corpses this year. Manchurian transportation is now entirely in the hands of the Japanese, so news spreading to the world has been embellished, and the severity of the overall situation cannot be fully understood. Representatives stationed in Geneva and Washington claim that the Japanese army is currently withdrawing, but in reality, they are encroaching and occupying new territories every day. Boycotting Japanese goods is a natural result of Japanese atrocities, but Japan is opposing it. Your government, as the initiator of the Washington Conference and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, is in a position to maintain the principles of these treaties, extend justice, and save the world from the tragedy of barbaric warfare. We hope you will take swift action. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>

The Japanese are spending huge sums of money to buy off lower-level staff of various agencies, sending them to various places to gather information or search residents for self-defense firearms. The Japanese army has a situation of concentrating towards Shenyang and Shen. The Shanhaiguan area is also reinforcing troops.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Japanese army has recently increased its troops in Xinmin and Liaoyuan, blockaded the Dalian port, shelled Beining passenger trains, and colluded with Mongolian bandits to cause disturbances. All of these are military actions and fully demonstrate their war preparations. Based on various reports, a telegram has been sent to the League of Nations requesting an immediate halt. Otherwise, the Japanese government should bear full responsibility for any incidents that arise as a result. Finally, it was stated that the Chinese people's morale is extremely high due to the Japanese army's invasion of the three northeastern provinces, but the government is obeying the League of Nations's proposal, repeatedly instructing the people to await the League of Nations's resolution, and is making every effort to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents in various places to ensure safety.

<p>###日政府决定限制軍事行動</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Cabinet decided today that the Air Force First Detachment flagship Akagi and the Second Destroyer Fleet, which were preparing to go to China, should return to Yokosuka Naval Port. Furthermore, two cruisers waiting to be sent to the Yangtze River will also return to Yokosuka from Sasebo. Chief of Staff Kanaya has already ordered the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Manchuria, Honjo, to send all combat aircraft back to Pyongyang, Korea. The commander of the Japanese army stationed in Korea, Hayashi, will send a team of reconnaissance aircraft to Shenyang to replace them. This move is intended to avoid misunderstandings from foreign countries. Although the bombing of Jinzhou was an act of self-defense, it caused a bad impression on foreign countries because this move happened to occur when combat aircraft were used for reconnaissance. According to military sources, the reconnaissance aircraft now being sent to Manchuria will not carry bombs, only machine guns, and their combat strength will be smaller in combat.

<p>###日軍暴行喪失國際同情</p>
<p>英法報之論評</p>
<p>London: The Times published an editorial this morning stating that the fundamental issue currently in dispute in Geneva is whether international relations should be handled through the ultimatum or force, or through arbitration or legal solutions. The answer to this question will have a great impact on the future stability of the world. This consideration must be emphasized first, while the merits of the dispute itself are secondary. The Japanese government may have many grievances against China and has expressed patience in seeking peaceful solutions to various cases, but judging from the current situation, the Japanese government is eager to negotiate with China based on the advantage of occupied territories, holding Chinese towns as collateral. This approach is indeed in line with old-fashioned diplomacy, but it is vastly different from the principles of League of Nations diplomacy. If Japan had first requested arbitration from the League of Nations and then taken direct action due to unsatisfactory solutions, Japan would have gained much sympathy and could have cited certain articles of the League of Nations charter to prove its claim to act for rights and justice. Unfortunately, Japan did not do so. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers have lengthy commentaries on the proceedings of the Executive Yuan's meeting, generally recognizing the Sino-Japanese dispute as one of the greatest difficulties encountered by the League of Nations. What actions Japan will take and what actions the League of Nations will take if that country does not change its attitude are what the newspapers eagerly want to know. Left-wing newspapers are particularly uneasy about the Soviet Union's silence and even propose that the Soviet Union participate. British newspapers generally state that the fundamental issue is whether international relations should be resolved by force or by arbitration and that the future peace of the world depends on this issue. (16th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Paris newspapers mostly believe that Briand's efforts to mediate and his diplomatic skills will be able to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute in a satisfactory manner. All the detailed issues between China and Japan must be carefully studied, and if necessary, direct negotiations can be left for another day. The important point at this moment is that the daily bloodshed due to minor contacts must be quickly stopped. If the Sino-Japanese conflict expands, it will inevitably exceed the local scope, and the Soviet Union may intervene under the pretext of protecting its interests. The Japanese government must be able to see this danger. (15th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The German Consulate General in Tianjin, the German Consulate in Shenyang, and the German Embassy in Tokyo have reported to the League of Nations the information they have obtained on the ground in Manchuria at the request of the League of Nations. The Germans reported that no serious incidents have been discovered. The Japanese side claims that the maintenance of order by the Chinese authorities in Manchuria is gradually becoming effective, so the Japanese soldiers currently stationed in Chinese towns number only about 650. The Japanese delegation today answered the question of the British representative, Lees, regarding the bombing of several towns by Japanese aircraft, which was raised by the Chinese General Labor Union yesterday, admitting that Japanese aircraft did drop bombs, but stating that Japanese aircraft were first shot at by Chinese soldiers before dropping bombs, and that one Japanese military officer was injured. They also mentioned anti-Japanese movements in Shanghai, Jiujiang, Shantou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The Japanese also claimed to have provided some small arms to the Chinese police in Shenyang to deal with bandits. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Lees today asked the Japanese representative, Yoshihiro, to explain the actions of Japanese military aircraft bombing Dagushan and Goubangzi. In response, Yoshihiro read the following telegram from Tokyo: "When Japanese military aircraft were scouting Dagushan and Goubangzi, Japanese aircraft were shot at by Chinese troops. After two Japanese airmen were injured, they dropped bombs." Yoshihiro also notified the Council today that the maintenance of order by the Japanese army in Shenyang is gradually becoming effective, and that the Japanese military authorities in Shenyang have decided to hand over police affairs in the city to the Chinese police. The headquarters of the 77th Regiment of the Japanese Army has moved into the South Manchurian Railway area, and the headquarters of the 78th Regiment of the Japanese Army has moved from the city to the Shenyang Arsenal. Therefore, 1,800 Japanese soldiers have been withdrawn to the South Manchurian Railway area. Yoshihiro also told the Council that the Japanese cruiser Tenryu has arrived in Shanghai and that marines have also landed and are stationed in various camps. Yoshihiro then submitted a report to the Council on the increasing anti-Japanese movement in Shanghai, Jiujiang, Shantou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. (15th National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>###某外人談國際對華形勢</p>
<p>(Beiping) A foreign member of the diplomatic corps told reporters that the League of Nations's reopening of the Council was originally to be presided over by Leroux but was temporarily chaired by French Foreign Minister Briand. The reason is that the League of Nations's previous resolution to have Japan withdraw its troops before the 14th was ineffective, and the League of Nations's credibility was severely damaged. At the same time, the United States sent a memorandum to the League of Nations with stern wording, alarming all of Europe, believing that if the League of Nations has no good way to resolve the situation, the League of Nations will no longer be possible. France, the only backing of the League of Nations and the master of Europe, is quite anxious. Therefore, Briand prevented Leroux from attending and resolutely came forward in person. Briand's diplomatic skills are flexible enough to influence the League of Nations. France, in view of the actions of Britain and the United States on the Shenyang case, has a situation of uniting and attacking Japan on its conflicting interests. Once Britain and the United States unite, France will be isolated in Europe. It is inevitable that France will consolidate its position by uniting with Japan. This time, the League of Nations will inevitably pull France as its backing. If the League of Nations resolves the situation by hoping that China and Japan will each make concessions or through direct negotiations between the two countries, China will suffer a great loss. The only country that China relies on, the League of Nations, will then have nothing to say. It is a pity that Chinese diplomacy has no policy in peacetime and does not know what to do in an emergency. Since the League of Nations is not enough to rely on, China is still obsessed with it and will eventually fail. It is too late to save it. Chinese diplomacy should be quick to plan.

<p>Business News: Gold Price Falls Eight Taels, Trend Shifts from Strong to Weak. Yesterday, the sixteenth, the price of gold changed from strong to weak, fluctuating erratically, with many twists and turns. In between, prices rose and fell by two or three taels, sometimes five or six taels, for a total difference of fifteen taels throughout the day. As a result, the price fell eight taels again. Dealers’ intentions leaned downwards, but buying and selling were vastly different, with few having a firm grasp. As for the silver market, which has been falling for days, it initially opened strong but later saw a flood of selling pressure. Furthermore, an oversupply of foreign exchange caused the market to suddenly appear weak. It has already broken through the 700 tael mark, and the market outlook is increasingly thorny. Rumors that the Japanese cabinet is deteriorating and on the verge of collapse are circulating, leading to a further easing of exchange rates. The Indian exchange rate fell and then rose, so the price of gold fell to 692.3 taels. However, due to an excessive number of short sellers, the price did not fall significantly.</p>
<p>Morning Market: From High to Low. The market opened in the morning four taels and three mace higher at 706 taels. Large bars fell another eighth, and the price of silver fell a quarter, with few buyers. The European market was soft, then rose to 707 taels. Unfortunately, market sentiment seemed weak, and firms such as Cuichang, Yongqian, Changxiang, and Tongtaichang all sold off, immediately pushing prices downstream. In addition, US dollars were being sold at $32.375 by banks. By the time the British gold announcement came, it was only 703.2 taels. The posted price of US dollars shrunk by 0.125, while British gold remained unchanged. Subsequently, there was a盘头 of just over one tael, from 2.5 to 4 taels. Domestic British and American exchange rates remained normal.

The market situation is currently impeccable, and it is not surprising to see further progress. However,套头 transactions of 進近出遠 are quite active. The spot yarn has been settled, and the situation is stable, but some people predict that winter sales will be disappointing.</p>

It is rumored that there are more than 10,000担 of Chen Shaanxi cotton waiting to be delivered in the market. On the receiving side, it seems that no one is willing to take delivery. Therefore,浮空 competed to sell, resulting in this tragic situation. The remaining months were affected by the strike from the first month, and were also forced to decline due to the weakness of American cotton. The amount of現棉 coming out of the four townships is still sparse, but the dealers who hold hand goods are more willing to sell. It is said that the amount of cotton上市 in Hankou is gradually increasing. However, the asking price is still high, and local factories and dealers are not interested in buying.</p>

<p>Li Shijia Returned to Shanghai Yesterday　　Minsheng Ship Supervised for Trial Firing Today　　Mr. Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Naval Ministry, arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru the day before yesterday and arrived at the port yesterday afternoon. He landed at the Hongkou Huishan Wharf and will supervise the Minsheng new ship for trial firing outside Wusongkou this morning. Zhang Ming, Consul-General to India, Scheduled to Sail Overseas　　Zhang Ming, a registered minister of the National Government and Consul-General in Java, was previously ordered to be transferred to the position of Consul-General in India. He has now arrived in Shanghai to prepare for his voyage. All the procedures are almost complete. It is decided that on the 24th of this month, he will take the French mail ship "Ato Second" with his wife, Ms. Zhou, and attendants, including Yu Ronghe, a party of more than ten people, first to sail overseas. Passing through Hong Kong, they will transfer to another ship to reach Calcutta, the capital of India, directly. After arriving at the consulate, he will immediately assume his duties. The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center has also specially entrusted him to investigate various industries in India to communicate information. Self-Made Yarn Twist Testing Machine　　One of the Improved Instruments of the Commodity Inspection Bureau　　The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has recently manufactured a yarn twist testing machine, which is one of the improved instruments for technical personnel, specially for the special needs of China's textile industry. Although the application of this machine is not much different from imported products, its structure is original and has many special features. It is more suitable for practical use than imported products. The machine is equipped with two counters, which is one of its characteristics. The number of twists and turns of the yarn and its direction of twist are directly displayed on the counters without the need for repeated calculations. Its structure is based on scientific principles, and all parts are precisely manufactured by machines and carefully assembled. The gear racks and feet are all made of copper, or plated with white nickel, or sprayed with black paint. The machine parts that are subject to wear are made of steel and plated with thick inscriptions to prevent rust, to suit the climate of our country. The price is very low, and there is a huge difference compared to imported products, so it is for the general application of various textile factories. It is heard that the Military and Political Department of the National Government has purchased one from the bureau. Wu Tongwen Sued for Returning to Ancestry Case　　Wu Tongwen, a paint merchant, was previously sued by Zhou, an old woman from Shaoxing, through a lawyer, Ren, at the mediation court of the Second Special Court, requesting confirmation of parentage and return to ancestry. Because the mediation failed, Zhou still entrusted lawyer Zheng Wenkai to file a formal lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Judge Qu Zengze, accompanied by Prosecutor Ding Shikui, opened a court session to summon the plaintiff and defendant. Neither of the parties appeared in court. Witnesses Zhao Pinhou and Zhao Zhulin were represented by lawyers who appeared in court and claimed that the Zhao brothers had recently left Shanghai due to some matters, so they did not appear in court. The plaintiff's lawyer claimed that since the Zhao brothers did not appear in court, there was still a witness, Zhao Tingyuan, on file who could be cross-examined. The official ordered Zhao to be summoned to the case. It was claimed that the merchant was the nephew of Mrs. Zhao, the mother of Zhao Pinhou, namely Zhao Beishi. Twenty-seven years ago, Wu Futang lacked offspring, so the merchant and his aunt, Beishi, handled the adoption of Ren Zhou's son to the Wu family as a son. Later, ten years ago, Zhou had no choice but to entrust the merchant to ask Wu for 800 yuan for retirement. Later, when the money ran out, she came to Shanghai again and asked me to negotiate. Due to the amount involved, I refused to get involved. Zhou once directly entrusted someone to go and negotiate, and as a result, a subsidy of several thousand yuan was given. I don't know the rest of the details. Judge Qu ordered them to leave the court and wait for the witnesses to be summoned again for questioning. Xu Yan Died of Illness in Suzhou Prison　　Xu Yan, the former captain of the Water Patrol Team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, was dismissed by the former director Yuan Liang and sent to the local court for dereliction of duty due to embezzlement of seized opium. After questioning, he was sentenced to five years in prison. Xu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which immediately submitted the case to Suzhou for trial. Later, the High Court's review and judgment upheld the original judgment. Therefore, Xu appealed to the Supreme Court again. At this time, Xu was quite depressed in Suzhou Prison and remained silent all day long. Soon after, he received the sad news of his mother's death, which made him even more grief-stricken. He fell ill and died. His family went to Suzhou to prepare a coffin for burial. Child Burned to Death in Fire　　Unrecognizable After Being Dug Out　　Xue Yuncheng, a Jiangbei native from No. 15 Fuhui Lane, Tiantong Road, Hujia Wooden Bridge, made a living by setting up a book stall. A relative, Chen Er, entrusted his two-year-old daughter, Xindi, to his care. Unexpectedly, the Xue couple were both out the day before yesterday, and the child was left on the bed. A fire broke out in front of the stove, but there was no one at home to put it out. When a patrol officer saw it, he immediately reported it to the Fifth District, Third Precinct, and notified the fire brigade to extinguish the fire. Only half a room was destroyed, but the child was buried in the fire. She was already unrecognizable when dug out. The precinct arrested Xue and sent him to the Public Security Bureau, who transferred him to the local court for interrogation yesterday. Apprentice Fracas Tragedy　　Zhu Longbao Died of Abdominal Injuries　　The Murderer Was Prosecuted by the Police　　Zhu Longbao, a sixteen-year-old Changshu native who was an apprentice at Zhou Shunfa's copper shop in Yangshupu Yihua Yarn, would go to the workshop at No. 2701 on the same road with his colleague Chen Bingcai, a Jiangyin native, to stay after work every day. Unexpectedly, at about 6 p.m. on the 13th of this month, everyone returned to the workshop to rest. Chen went upstairs and saw that the bedroom door was locked. He asked for the key, but Zhu Longbao did not say anything and took out the key after a long time. Chen criticized him severely, and Zhu also became angry and responded with harsh words. Then they wrestled each other, kicking each other in the lower body. As a result, Zhu Longbao suffered abdominal injuries and fell to the ground in pain. His companion Huang Buzhi and others sent him back to his mother Zhu Wang's house at No. 50 on the same road. He died at about 1 a.m. yesterday morning. Ms. Zhu reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, which sent detective Liu Changgen and a Western detective to investigate the scene. The body was sent to the autopsy institute on Feilun Road. At 9:30 a.m., Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the institute to examine the body. He ascended to the official position. Witnesses Huang Buzhi, Tao Si, and Zhang Afu testified one after another about the situation at the time. The deceased's mother, Zhu Wang, demanded justice. Zhou Shunfa also testified that the deceased was an apprentice in his shop, but he did not witness the fight with Chen Bingcai at the time. Mr. Guo reviewed the testimony and announced that the autopsy showed that the deceased Zhu Longbao died of injuries. The murderer Chen Bingcai will be prosecuted by the police and should be sent to the court for review. The body was handed over to the deceased's mother, Zhu Wang, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial. Child Scalded to Death by Hot Oil　　Bicyclist Causes No Small Disaster　　Ouyang Liansheng, the owner of Yimao Noodle Shop at No. 152 Xujiahui Road, Malang Road, French Concession, whose three-year-old son, Changqing, was accompanied by an apprentice to buy glutinous rice cakes at a glutinous rice cake stall in front of No. 149 next door at 10:40 a.m. on the 14th. At this time, a certain Gan was riding a bicycle and, because he did not know how to drive, knocked over the oil pot for frying glutinous rice cakes, causing the hot oil to scald the child's face. Someone saw that a disaster had occurred and abandoned the bicycle and fled. Later, the patrolmen arrived and took the injured child, along with the bicycle, to the police station. The patrol chief ordered him to be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. He died the next day (15th) at 5 p.m. due to serious injuries. The hospital notified the police station, who carried the child's body to the autopsy institute of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. Yesterday morning, the Vehicle Management Office reported to the Second Court, and Prosecutor Lou Guanguang, accompanied by forensic doctor Wei Ligong, arrived at the institute to examine the body. He ascended to the official position. The chief of the Vehicle Management Office reported the previous situation. Mr. Lou announced that the autopsy showed that Ouyang Changqing died of injuries. The body was handed over to his father, Ouyang Liansheng, for burial. The defendant is at large and should be investigated and arrested by the police and sent to court for interrogation. Liang Shiyu Crushed to Death by Car　　Liang Shiyu, a worker, was about thirty years old. Yesterday morning, he was walking on the side of Zhongshan Road, Fanwangdu, when he was unexpectedly knocked down by a car of a certain number. The wheels crushed Liang's head, waist, and other parts, causing his head to be broken and his waist to be broken. He died immediately. The area was sparsely populated, and the car fled the scene. Later, someone discovered that Liang was dead and reported it to the Sixth District Police Station, which ordered the local security officer to report it to the local court for autopsy. Prosecutor Yang and others examined the body and ordered the family to collect it for burial and await further investigation. Female Nun Who Dug Graves Gets Three Years　　Second Instance Judgment in Suzhou　　Qingshan, a female nun from Lujia Guanyin Temple on Changbang Road in this city, was sentenced to imprisonment for stealing and digging up the graves of ancestors, privately selling the cemetery, and defrauding money. Qingshan refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal. The court sent the entire case file and the original defendant to the Suzhou High Court for review. It is now known that the Shanghai court received an order from the High Court yesterday informing them that the case had been concluded by the Third Criminal Division the day before yesterday (15th). The main text of the judgment was announced, the original judgment on the crime and punishment was revoked, and Qingshan was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for colluding in the illegal sale. The private prosecution part was not accepted. Liquidation Inquiry of Heyixiang Creditor Group　　Heyixiang Cotton Yarn and Grocery Store, a Guangbang company in this city, has been operating in Shanghai for more than 40 years. It has always had a good reputation and has had a large amount of business with money houses and banks. However, it has recently been rumored that the company is in financial difficulties, which has attracted the attention of Guangbang colleagues. According to sources in the financial world, Liang Yanqing, Xue Zibin, and other shareholders of the company are all wealthy merchants. Recently, due to poor management and dispatch by the manager, the turnover has been sluggish. There are 18 banks and money houses that have business dealings with the company, and the amount owed is limited. A creditor group has now been formed to carry out liquidation. However, it is heard that after the creditor group conducted an on-site audit, it was discovered that some shareholders had illegally claimed to withdraw their shares, and the manager and employees were owed about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Therefore, the group has hired legal counsel to send letters to Liang, Xue, and other shareholders to take charge of the matter. It is hoped that the company, which has been established for many years, will be able to remedy the situation if it is temporarily in financial difficulties. Moreover, it concerns the reputation of Guangbang, and it is believed that a satisfactory solution will not be difficult. He Rongzhou, a Hemorrhoid Specialist, Holds Consultations　　Hemorrhoids and fistulas are the most common diseases. Medical experts in both Chinese and Western medicine have not yet invented a medicine to eradicate the root cause. Now there is Dr. He Rongzhou, a hemorrhoid specialist, who has obtained a secret ancestral method that can remove the hemorrhoid tube within a limited number of days without any pain and permanently eradicate the root cause. Dr. He is determined to save the world and has specially established the Chinese Specialized Hemorrhoid and Fistula Treatment Center in Hong Deli, opposite Lujia Guanyin Temple on Changbang Road in the French Concession. He holds consultations every Saturday to enable the poor to get rid of this pain. It is heard that since Dr. He set up the clinic, it has been quite crowded with patients, and they have praised him as a national expert in treating hemorrhoids. Hollywood Discount Ends Today　　The Hollywood Photo Studio on Sichuan Road in this city has always been known for taking artistic photos. In addition to the natural light photography studio, the studio also has the invention of artificial light photography, which can be taken day or night, with appropriate tones and exceptional beauty. The recent third anniversary is half-price. It is heard that today is the last day. People from all walks of life should not miss this opportunity. Sincere &amp; Co. Seals Japanese Goods　　Previously Sold Items Were All Compliant　　A letter from the First District Branch of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation to the City Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stated that the report on the 13th stated that Sincere &amp; Co. sold enemy goods. After investigation, it was found that there was a slight misunderstanding before receiving the association's notice to implement the sealing. Now, after investigation by the citizens' association, it has been learned that the situation is consistent with the facts stated in the letter, and the staff has a firm declaration of anti-Japanese national salvation. According to law and human sentiment, there is a reason for it. "National Crisis Tragic Pictorial" Published by Life Weekly　　At the Same Time, Soliciting Experts to Develop Concrete Methods for National Salvation　　The "Life Weekly," published by the Life Weekly Society at the intersection of Hualong Road and Huanlong Road in Shanghai, has been published for five and a half years and has never missed an issue. It is highly valued by people at home and abroad. It is now heard that the society is extremely angry at the violent Japanese occupation of the Northeast. In addition to issuing a special issue of "National Day and National Mourning" in Volume 6, Issue 42 to alert readers, it also published anti-Japanese texts in Volume 6, Issue 43, such as Tao Fen's "Rather Die Unyielding than Protect National Rights," Tu Ran's "Returning from Liaoning," Shi E's "Life and Death in a Breath," Jun Yi's "Extremely Tense," Hai Tian's "Several Conferences Amidst the Anti-Japanese Sound," Juan Dong's "Speaking with Tears," and "Intolerable to Humanity," Wu Youyi's "The Process of Petitioning in Beijing," etc., and attached multiple photos of the "National Crisis Tragic Pictorial," all of which are shocking and tragic photos. It has been published today. It is also heard that the society, in order to expand publicity, has specially solicited articles entitled (1) "The Most Effective Concrete Methods to Boycott Japanese Goods," (2) "The Most Effective Concrete Methods for National Military Training," each limited to 3,000 to 5,000 words. The deadline for submissions is November 17. The best article of each type will be selected and published in the publication for the adoption of the people of the country. The society will also pay a reward of one hundred yuan to show encouragement. However, contributors must pay attention to (1) considering the actual situation in China, (2) being feasible and not just chanting high-sounding slogans, (3) having concrete methods and not just empty talk. The matter concerns anti-Japanese national salvation, and experts are sincerely requested to give advice. Ningshao Life Insurance Company Established　　Le Zhenbao and other business giants in this city initiated the establishment of Ningshao Life Insurance Company. Preparations have been underway for more than a month. Yesterday, a founding conference was held at the Bankers Association. Mr. Le Zhenbao was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. (1) Perform the ceremony as usual. (2) Mr. Yuan Ludeng reported on the preparations, stating that the total capital of the company is 250,000 yuan in national currency, which has been fully subscribed by the initiators and paid in full at one time. The shares have been paid, including 175,000 yuan in ocean currency, deposited in the Zhonghua Quan Gong Bank, and 75,000 yuan, deposited in the Bank of Communications. During the preparation period, the English insurance policy was translated into Chinese to facilitate the people of the country to insure their lives. The content of the policy is clear at a glance, without any textual obstacles. (3) Discuss the articles of association. (4) Mr. Hu Yongqi reported on the business budget and plan, stating that life insurance business has long been popular in Europe and the United States. This kind of business can directly protect personal production and indirectly maintain social stability. Therefore, the company follows this purpose and uses education methods to strive for popularization. The internal management is based on scientific principles. At the beginning of the business, we will first operate in this city and the vicinity of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and then expand to the South Seas Islands and other places. (5) Election of directors and supervisors. At that time, Le Zhenbao, Wang Xinguan, Lou Xunru, Hu Mengjia, He Qixuan, Liu Pinsan, Liu Zhanen, Chen Xuejia, Zhu Maocheng, Yuan Ludeng, and Sun Meitang were elected as directors, and Li Zuhua, Wang Yunfu, Wu Jingxiong, Hong Xianfang, and Zhou Tingzun were elected as supervisors. After the ceremony, there was tea and snacks. By the time the meeting was adjourned, the bell had already rung five times. Special Article　　It's Not Difficult to Boycott Japanese Goods at All (Zhong Xia)　　As Long as There Are Practical Methods (2)　　The National Academic and Industrial Circles Should Rise Up　　Several Practical and Feasible Methods　　Boycotting Japanese goods does not hinder China's production, does not affect our lives, and there is no reason why it cannot be done. But how to identify Japanese goods and how to prevent merchants who disregard the overall situation must have practical methods in order to be effective and lasting. I have been thinking about this method of boycotting goods day and night for the past few days. What I have thought of, others probably have also thought of. Newspapers, you make a suggestion, I make a suggestion, and I don't know how many have been published. In order to concentrate everyone's thoughts and determine the direction of action, I would like to present the methods that I think are the most practical and effective for everyone's reference.　　(1) The government should issue a decree that all imported goods must be marked with the place of origin on each item, otherwise import is prohibited. If it is discovered that there is any confusion with other countries' goods, the goods will be confiscated and import will not be allowed in the future. The things made in China must also be marked with the nationality of the factory's capital. After the goods are imported, the handlers or shops shall not change the trademark or nationality. Violators shall be punished for fraud. When goods are analyzed and retailed, if the name of the country cannot be printed on the goods (such as sugar, seafood, etc.), the store should add a label indicating the place of origin. From the importer to the wholesaler, from the wholesaler to the retailer, and from the retailer to the customer, they must be responsible for declaring in writing which country the goods are from. If there is any impersonation, the recipient may return the goods at any time and may be charged with fraud. Forcing foreign goods to be marked with the place of origin, Australia has been implementing it for several years. Their purpose is to promote domestic goods. In China, it can also be used to boycott the goods of any country. All groups should jointly request the government to pass this law and immediately implement it by the customs.　　(2) Newspapers should dedicate a column every day to publish the main varieties, forms, and trademarks of Japanese goods, so that everyone knows how to identify them. The space occupied by the newspaper does not need to be very large, as long as dozens of the most important Japanese goods are classified and disclosed every day. Too many items will make people confused. The names of Japanese goods must use the most common language, avoiding specialized terms. There are many people who intentionally do not buy Japanese goods, but buy Japanese goods as domestic goods. Recently, Japanese goods often avoid Japanese characters, and some even impersonate German goods and Chinese goods. How can ordinary people distinguish them? We often hear many people ask, is this cloth Japanese cloth or British cloth? Is this thermos bottle German or Japanese? It can be seen that everyone feels this difficulty.　　(3) Under each Japanese goods in the list of Japanese goods, the names and trademarks of non-Japanese substitute goods should be noted. If there are too many types of Japanese goods or it is not easy to identify them, we only need to identify these few trademarks of non-Japanese goods to buy, and there will be no mistakes. (We know that some goods have a lot of Japanese goods, so we can be extra careful and not buy except for these few brands.) This method is much simpler and more effective than directly identifying Japanese goods. Everyone must not ignore it. This list of non-Japanese goods should be jointly reported by non-Japanese manufacturers or distributors, mutually supervised, and then carefully investigated and published by the Anti-Japanese Association. In addition to being published in newspapers every day, the above-mentioned list of Japanese goods and non-Japanese goods should also be printed in hundreds of thousands of copies of large-sized leaflets and sent to all Shanghai stores to be posted on counters and walls, so that customers can refer to them at any time. In addition, they should also be distributed to each household to be posted in conspicuous places, so as not to be lost easily. At the same time, distribute the pledge to not buy Japanese goods and ask the head of the household to sign it. There are hundreds of thousands of households in Shanghai. One person can be responsible for dozens of households, and ten thousand people can do it in one day. Students and volunteers can do this work.　　(4) Merchants who personally sign a pledge not to sell Japanese goods and whose shops have been investigated by the Anti-Japanese Association to confirm that there are no Japanese goods will be awarded a special plaque by the association, "This store pledges not to sell Japanese goods, certified by the Anti-Japanese Association," to be hung at the door. This plaque not only informs customers to avoid them, but also reminds everyone of the oath to boycott Japanese goods everywhere on the road. Of course, people should be sent to investigate secretly after the event. If any fraud is discovered, their plaques will be removed, their names will be announced, and they will be severely punished.　　(5) The Japanese goods that were indeed imported before the boycott and have been registered should be concentrated in several places and supervised by the Anti-Japanese Association. In this way, the Japanese goods found in the stores can be determined to be privately imported goods. If they are allowed to be scattered and sold everywhere and mixed with privately imported goods, the inspection work will be impossible to carry out. The so-called "inventory" will continue to come and will never have a clear day.　　(6) All industry guilds should stipulate covenants that they will not import or sell Japanese goods, and violators will be severely punished. They will pay a fine several times the value of the privately imported Japanese goods. This kind of alliance should be in the form of a contract, signed and sealed by the managers of each company, and stored in a public institution. Legal experts are requested to study how this contract of fine should be worded in order to be legally effective.　　(7) Customs officers, dock workers, warehouse workers, railway and shipping personnel, because of their position, are more aware of the import and export of goods. Anti-Japanese organizations must contact them and communicate with each other so that Japanese goods will not escape. Dock workers should be made to not unload Japanese goods or unload goods for Japanese ships. Those who lose their jobs because of this should be provided with living expenses in order to be sustainable. This is an extremely important key point. The method of clearing the source must not be let go. It may not be easy to take on the lives of all the workers in Japanese factories in Shanghai, but the amount of living expenses for a part of the dock workers is limited, and there is no reason why it cannot be afforded. If dock workers can unanimously resist Japan, the effect will be extremely great, far exceeding the strike of workers in Japanese factories. Our economic strength is limited and should be concentrated at this critical moment. Why did Guangzhou's blockade of Hong Kong in 1926 have such amazing results? It was because the dock workers at that time were on strike against Britain while still receiving wages. The siege of Hong Kong lasted for a year and three months.　　(8) In order to enable the anti-Japanese organization to be sustainable and unremitting, it cannot rely solely on the enthusiasm of a few volunteers. Everyone has their own duties and cannot be busy with this matter all day long. After a while, no one will be responsible for everything. I think the Anti-Japanese Association should pay high salaries to hire several enthusiastic people who are trusted by the society to preside over the actual affairs of the association. Of course, all other staff members are paid. They do this job because they are paid for it, and someone will always be responsible for the affairs of the association, and it will not disappear invisibly. As for the honorary representatives of all circles, their position is like the directors of a company, only discussing the general direction of administration. Even if they cannot attend the meeting often, it will not cause the affairs of the association to be suspended. To maintain a permanent organization, of course, we must raise permanent funds. The salaries of clerks and inspectors, if shared by various industries, will also be very light.　　(9) Automatic inspection by the same industry, because they are familiar with the internal situation, is certainly better than outsiders. However, people in the same industry are often familiar with each other, and there may be things that are tolerated and not investigated out of consideration for face. I think people from other industries should be added to the joint inspection. Merchants or manufacturers of domestic goods or Western goods are the most suitable for this work, because their goods are often in competition with Japanese goods. There are many types of industries in Shanghai, and some groups are very small, with only a few people in total. The drawbacks of collusion in the same industry must be prevented. Reader Correspondence　　Mr. Wang Yuxiang's Message (Stop Internal Strife and Encourage Soldiers to Fight)　　All of our citizens know about the various brutal means used by Japan against us. Now, if we want to defeat the Japanese, it is better for all kinds of newspapers to jointly publish articles demanding a cessation of internal strife between the North and the South. Please also ask the commanders of the various armies to lecture the soldiers about the situation of our suffering from Japanese brutality and oppression, arouse our courage, unite our spirit, and fight against Japan. Our soldiers, sacrificing for the country, are ten thousand times better than being slaves to a fallen country. Death is without regret. Just think, who are the people who die and are injured in our internal strife, whose wealth is consumed, and whose people are harmed? If this continues, we will not know to what extent we will be oppressed by Japan in the future. Therefore, please ask your newspaper to publish this article. I am a foolish soldier who speaks of fighting first. Although my words are rough, I hope you can forgive me.　　(Reply) The state raises troops, but unfortunately, they are used for internal warfare. Who are the people who die and are injured, whose wealth is consumed, and whose people are harmed? The letter says, how painful. The common people have no tears to shed. Gentlemen, you are in the army, so you are naturally even more heartbroken. From now on, encourage courage to face the outside world, unite spirit to face the outside world. Mr. Wang Yingchen's Message (Disclose the Names of Enemy Goods)　　Since I became an adult, I have loved reading newspapers. If there is a Shen Bao in Sichuan, I will buy it and read it. It has been thirty-five years now, and my relationship with your newspaper is not shallow. Now, Japan, with its relationship as a country of the same culture, is ruthless, unreasonable, and enslaves our people. It is outrageous to speak of. My family of seven has already destroyed all enemy goods, clothing, and children's toys without leaving any behind. However, there are too many merchants in our country who do not know the big picture and take advantage of this economic severance to profit from it. Your newspaper is the most valuable newspaper. It can publish the names of enemy goods in detail. If there are enthusiastic people, they will definitely advise our people in the cities and villages not to buy enemy goods, and never buy enemy goods. This is what I hope from your newspaper. I am nearing the age of knowing destiny and am sick, dizzy, and my eyes are blurred. Please forgive me.　　(Reply) There are too many types of Japanese goods, and our newspaper's materials are too crowded and cannot spare space to publish them all. However, when there are important product names, please send them to our newspaper and we will publish them as appropriate. It is heard that enthusiastic families are investigating and compiling them, and it is hoped that they will be printed into a special booklet and widely distributed as soon as possible. I also hope that you will jointly promote them in the interior. I have respectfully learned about the other items in the letter and will not reply separately.

<p>Youth Garden Sentinel　　Ze Mian　　The setting sun hangs in the west, and my heart begins to tremble with cold. Being in the middle of that dark night is like being trapped in a wilderness full of enemies. Occasionally hearing the sound of the wind and the barking of dogs, I suspect it is a sign of the enemy's arrival, and my hair cannot help but stand on end. I hate the length of this long night and hope that the universe will change and eliminate the terrible night, often with the bright and brilliant light of the sun looking down. Alas, this village night of thieves like fur, has been interrupted for two years, unexpectedly it has been restored in this famous "comfortable nest" of Shanghai.　　The usual annoying noise in the school and the pleasing and annoying sounds of the organ, violin, huqin, and gramophone songs have now unanimously announced a strike. The lights of "East Palace" are almost all hazy. The electric lights of "House of Lords" have even more current blocked. Even the rooms of the "House of Commons" have many windows that are set up but often closed. The sound of footsteps on the runway is rare. In short, everything in the school at night has shown that "indifferent and desolate", desolate and awe-inspiring, and the image of college students' lives is more noble than anything else, and their courage is thinner than anything else.　　However, the newly formed "Volunteer Army" of the school really makes me infinitely admire. When I saw last Tuesday night's "unfounded" "Japanese Marine Corps will land tonight," "tonight or occupy Zhabei Jiangwan," the alarming news spread, in the process of the whole school commotion, some lovers were busy looking for the opposite sex, some siblings were running around responding, some were busy hiding and transporting precious things, in addition to this, some were busy telling each other in horror, at that time a group of so-called intellectuals seemed to have completely lost their autonomy and gone crazy. Only the students of the "Volunteer Army" learned to be as "calm" as the people in power, and immediately gathered together like bees, carrying wooden guns with sharp knives, occupying the key points of the school as their "guard posts." Since then, after 10:30 every night, the whole school has announced a curfew. Without a "password", do not hope to cross the "forbidden area". Occasionally getting up in the middle of the night, looking out the window, those distant "sentries" are all visible.　　Alas, I am really ashamed of this person who cannot join the Volunteer Army due to physical reasons. In the night sentinel of tonight's golden wind, there are also several female volunteers. These female students have all volunteered and bravely walked into the ranks of the Volunteer Army. It is said that before the formation, a certain cadre of the Military Commission privately thought that they would have difficulty enduring labor and pitied them for having many inconveniences in being in a military unit with the opposite sex, and exempted them from writing their names. There was such a reaction,　　"Aren't we citizens of the Republic of China?　　"Can we be different from others in our responsibility to love and save the country? Moreover, is there a clause in the regulations for recruiting volunteers that female students are not allowed to participate?"　　Indeed, how can this question be answered? So their figures are finally active in the military.　　When this violent Japan relies on its strength to do evil and slaughter as a means, and the rumors and panic are endless, this group of school male volunteers who stand guard all night do not know what panic is, which has already made me infinitely admire, not to mention these female volunteers.</p>

<h3 id="e8">U.S. Government Has Not Yet Stated Its Position <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Hoover Seems Inclined to Accept the Invitation</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department views Japan's strong opposition to the United States participating in the League of Nations Administrative Council's discussions as a misrepresentation of the U.S.'s position. The State Department has not issued a formal statement. However, a State Department spokesperson stated today that the United States' only desire is to prevent war between China and Japan. Secretary of State Stimson met with Japanese Ambassador Debuchi today and informed him that if the U.S. Consul General in Geneva, Gilbert, is invited to participate in the League of Nations discussions, he will attend as an observer and will not participate in any procedures to prevent war according to the League's charter. State Department officials stated tonight that whether the U.S. will accept the invitation to participate in the Geneva discussions will depend on the nature of the invitation. Judging from the tone of State Department officials, President Hoover seems inclined to accept the invitation. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) As of late tonight, the State Department remains silent on whether it will accept the League of Nations Council's invitation to participate in discussions on the Manchurian Incident. It is reported that Secretary of State Stimson initially did not expect Japan to strongly oppose U.S. participation, so he telegraphed U.S. Consul General Gilbert in Geneva to accept the invitation and represent the U.S. at the Council meeting. However, the Council disregarded Japan's strong opposition and resolved to invite the U.S. to participate, causing some hesitation. It is now planned to issue a statement after the official invitation arrives. Meanwhile, Rong Kui, the Chinese Charge d'Affaires in the U.S., has published an article stating that China welcomes U.S. participation in the League of Nations Council to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. (National News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department was greatly alarmed today upon receiving news from Geneva that Japan opposes U.S. participation in the League of Nations Council's discussions on the Sino-Japanese dispute. A State Department spokesperson told the Associated Press that Japan's refusal to allow the U.S. to participate in the League of Nations Council simply forces them back to their old position. The U.S. is not a member of the League of Nations, so it may not be able to continue taking action on the matter. Secretary of State Stimson does not want to discuss the various messages about the League of Nations Council disregarding Japan's opposition and still voting by a vote of thirteen to one to invite the U.S. to participate in the Council meeting until he receives official confirmation. The Associated Press has learned that Secretary of State Stimson's plan to cooperate with the League of Nations to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute is based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact's provisions for arbitrating international disputes, and he hopes to put pressure on both China and Japan. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Debuchi stated to Stimson today that Japan will never declare war on China under any circumstances. It is said that Debuchi's assurance has greatly comforted the people of Washington. Debuchi's words may lead people to believe that the Sino-Japanese dispute is not as serious as it was a week ago. However, Japan's opposition to U.S. participation in the Council makes people believe that an early resolution of the dispute will be greatly hindered as a result. People here also believe that the U.S. will reject the League of Nations Council's invitation to participate after receiving it tomorrow. This matter has put Secretary of State Stimson in a dilemma, because before the invitation was issued, he had already telegraphed U.S. Consul General Gilbert in Geneva to formally accept the Council's invitation, which would mean attending the Council meeting as a representative of the U.S. If he now refuses to accept the invitation to participate, it would be inconsistent and would be frowned upon by the League of Nations and the thirteen Council members who are advocating for this matter. If he resolutely accepts the invitation, he fears offending friendly Japan. (National News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) News from Tokyo states that anti-American sentiment has arisen among the Japanese due to U.S. participation in the League of Nations Administrative Council. Political circles here find this very strange, saying that Tokyo should now be aware of the resentment caused by the Japanese army's invasion of China. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian government officials are closely watching what policy the United States will adopt regarding the Sino-Japanese Manchurian issue. The League of Nations Council's resolute vote to invite the United States to participate in the Council meeting, despite Japan's opposition, is particularly valued by Soviet Russia. The Pravda newspaper commented that the Washington government is greatly alarmed by the extent of Japan's invasion of China. What the United States wants is to preserve its priority rights in Manchuria and gradually seek aggression, and it now wants to use the League of Nations to cover up its traces.

<p>Shih Expresses Welcome to U.S. Participation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Geneva, 15th - Shih Chao-chi had an important conversation with Briand on the 14th, which has attracted much attention. The main points are as follows: (1) Briand said, "It is said that a certain Chinese army has uneasy movements, is this true?" Shih replied, "This is probably referring to Wang Yizhe's army moving from the Eastern Province to within the Great Wall. China has ordered them to avoid contact with the Japanese." (2) Briand asked whether the Chinese side opposes neutral personnel going to the scene when recovering the withdrawn troops. Shih replied, "I do not oppose it," and said that this is roughly the same as what the representative had previously requested. (3) Briand asked whether China opposes the United States participating in the Administrative Council. Shih replied, "China welcomes it very much." (4) Shih asked whether the neutral committee covers the issue of responsibility since September 18th, and compensation. Briand replied, "It is not a committee, but neutral personnel going to the scene during the withdrawal of troops. This is based on the Polish-Lithuanian case, which was once approved by the Japanese committee." (5) Shih stated to Briand that the rumors of direct negotiations are baseless. Briand said, "I understand very well," and said that talking in the Administrative Council can also be called Sino-Japanese negotiations. (6) Shih asked Briand to pay attention to the urgency of the troop withdrawal, and read out a telegram from the Chinese embassy in Japan stating that the Japanese General Staff Headquarters is very active. Briand replied, "Please China exercise patience, because the Administrative Council has accepted this matter and will always pay attention to it." (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Japan Releases Air of Withdrawing from the League of Nations <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Insists on Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>Does Not Allow Outside Interference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Judging from the latest developments tonight, if Japan has to choose between withdrawing from the League of Nations or giving up direct negotiations with China to resolve the Manchurian issue, Japan will take the former. Japan firmly believes that the League of Nations' decision to invite the U.S. to participate in the Administrative Council's discussions violates the League of Nations charter and will seriously damage the structure of the entire League. The Japanese interpret the League of Nations' decision to invite the U.S. to participate in the discussion as the League of Nations and the U.S. willing to cooperate to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact, thereby forcibly interfering by a third party, which Japan resolutely rejects at any cost. Japan's firm stance clearly seeks to effectively state the importance of its rights and interests in Manchuria, which has been repeatedly stated and cannot be changed, so it cannot allow outside interference to resolve disputes related to its survival. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Nagasaki government stated tonight regarding the possibility of Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations, that although the government has not seriously considered this matter, it admits that if the League of Nations disregards Japan's opinions and reaches an unreasonable degree, the aroused national sentiment will increase to the point of demanding withdrawal from the League of Nations. The spokesperson himself believes that the League of Nations will carefully consider the matter and will recognize the legitimacy of Japan's claims. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Wakatsuki expressed his opinion to the press regarding the League of Nations' invitation to the United States to participate in the discussion, saying that the League of Nations' efforts for peace are commendable, but the proposal to invite non-member states to participate in the Administrative Council discussion is unprecedented, and there is no provision in the League of Nations charter for this matter, so the Japanese government has doubts about the legality of the resolution supported by the majority. It is heard that the Japanese government will send instructions to Yoshizawa tonight, asking the League of Nations to carefully study the resolution to invite the U.S. to participate in the discussion, because it is considered to be not only in conflict with the League of Nations charter, but also greatly detrimental to the structure of the entire League. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the League of Nations' resolution, saying that Japan now has two options regarding this matter: one is to strongly argue on the procedural point that unanimous consent should be required, and the other is to agree to the participation of the U.S., but there must be an understanding that the U.S. will participate purely as an observer. The cabinet is currently holding a meeting to discuss whether to include in the instructions to Yoshizawa the suggestion telegraphed by Ambassador Debuchi in the United States, asking Tokyo to reconsider its attitude. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A famous American financier, Lamont, urgently telegraphed Finance Minister Inoue in his private capacity, asking him to briefly inform him of the truth about the Manchurian situation. The concern of American financiers about the possible developments of the Manchurian Incident can be seen from this. Inoue will reply tonight, sincerely stating that the Sino-Japanese dispute will never lead to war, and that the whole problem has been exaggerated and is being regarded as an event that endangers world peace, which is unreasonable.

<p>(Harbin) The fighting between Jiangqiao on the Tao'ang Railway is still fierce. Yu's Brigade and Wu Song-shan's Brigade from Zhaodong are in contact and have the upper hand. Zhang Hai-peng's troops have suffered considerable losses. Zhang Hai-peng himself is now commanding in Tierge near Jiangqiao. The First Cavalry Brigade of the Heilongjiang Army and the Second Brigade of Zhang Dian-jiu's troops rushed to Jiangqiao Station from Fularji Station today to reinforce them. Two Japanese aircraft flew from Tongliao to Jiangqiao Station to assist Zhang's army in attacking. On the night of the 15th, a Japanese armored train opened the Tao'ang Railway to cover Zhang's army's advance. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The two regiments of the Tunkun Army of Xing'an District, Sun and Wang, acted in unison with Yu Zhao-lin's Brigade. They mobilized from Tuquan on the 15th to attack the back of Zhang's army. Now Zhang's army is attacked from both sides. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Because Zhang Jing-hui had an old friendship with Zhang Hai-peng, he sent his advisor Lei Chun to Jiangqiao Station on the night of the 15th to persuade the two armies to stop attacking. Zhang's army temporarily retreated to its original defense. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Many members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee avoided Harbin on the 14th. Many Japanese residents avoided Qiang and fled to Harbin. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 14th, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Longjiang Chamber of Commerce went south to welcome Zhang. On the 15th, the Heilongjiang Army's Yu Zhao-lin Brigade and the Xing'an Tunkun Army destroyed the Nenjiang Bridge and attacked Zhang's army from both sides. Zhang's troops suffered many losses and could not advance north. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Japanese aircraft have been flying along the Tao'ang Railway for days, assisting Zhang's army in combat, often going to Longjiang and the Qike Railway to reconnaissance. Japanese troops have been going to Taonan on two trains for days, joining Zhang's army. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) All vehicles on the Tao'ang Railway have been detained by the Japanese army. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xian-tao turned construction workers into a team of about 3,000 people and continued to recruit and compile. The Japanese secretly helped him with weapons and ammunition. There are rumors that Zhang is organizing the Mengjiang Command. The Tunkun Army stationed in Baichengzi retreated to Solun Mountain, Wangye Temple and other places. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The news that Zhang Hai-peng, the garrison commander of Taonan, is independent is gradually being confirmed. Reports have repeatedly come from Heilongjiang, but this place does not believe it very much. Yesterday, telegrams came from five princes including the Zakeqin Banner of Inner Mongolia and various legal entities from five counties including Tongliao, Liaoyuan, and Taonan, supporting Zhang as their leader. In fact, Zhang had moved them to send telegrams to prepare for independence. It is also heard that Zhang had recently sent a telegram saying that Japanese aid to the bandits and arms in Inner Mongolia had been intercepted. In fact, it was the Japanese supplies for Zhang. This issue is very serious. Zhang Hai-peng and Zhang Zuo-lin were sworn brothers, so Vice-Zhang always perfunctorily treated Zhang with face, but now he has done this, which is unexpected. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) For days, it has been reported that Zhang Hai-peng, the garrison commander of Taoliao, led his troops to Heilongjiang to become independent. Now a certain party received a telegram from Harbin stating that Zhang, as a 70-year-old man, was induced and coerced by the Japanese Huang Muli, and was also given the title of Gong Wang (Duke) as the General of Heilongjiang, and then, under the guns of the Japanese army, led his troops to advance towards Bu Kui. According to Wan Fu-lin, Ma Zhan-shan has departed from Heihe and is heading towards the Heilongjiang provincial capital, and is now somewhere tens of miles away from Jiangyuan. The provincial government has sent a car to meet him. Zhang Hai-peng's troops have four regiments, most of whom are bandits. This time, they received 6,000 rifles from the Japanese, so they suddenly rebelled. Jiangyuan is now very uneasy. Wan Fu-lin's mother and son Guo-bin arrived in Harbin yesterday. The entire Heilongjiang Provincial Committee left the province and came to Harbin. Two brigades of Zhang Hai-peng's troops boarded three trains and arrived in Heilongjiang. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Vice-Minister received a telegram from Xie Ke, the chief of staff of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Headquarters, on the 15th, stating that at noon on the 15th, a Japanese aircraft departed from Taonan and dropped two bombs on Tailai, and then circled around the provincial capital several times before leaving.

<p>(Tianjin) Chen Xingya passed through Tianjin at 7 pm on the 16th to go to Qizhou. He told reporters that Zang Shiyi is still in Shenyang and is being monitored by the Japanese army. Feng Yong is a scholar and is expected to be released safely soon. As for Zhang Hai-peng's change of state, I am very surprised. I know that Zhang is a patriotic and bloody man. On the night of the 18th of last month, the Japanese army occupied Shenyang. I was in Tao'an and heard Zhang say, "If the Japanese soldiers come to invade, I will beat them to a pulp. What kind of thing is non-resistance?" I expect that his attitude must have been coerced by the Japanese and he has no choice but to suffer. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Hai-peng, accompanied by the Japanese Huang Mu, led two brigades of infantry and three trains of soldiers to advance towards Bu Kui. Each train had several Japanese soldiers. All of Zhang's troops' weapons and ammunition were issued by the Japanese. The Japanese side is also building a large-scale aircraft factory in Changchun. The Russian side is paying great attention to this. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Soviet Russian Consul in Shenyang told a guest that he believed that the news of the Mongolian independence movement and Zhang Hai-peng's military conflict with Wan Fu-lin of Heilongjiang were exaggerated. Zhang recently announced his independence and advanced on Qiqihar from Wo'nan, causing residents of Qiqihar and other places to flee to Harbin. The Russian Consul also denied the various rumors that the Russian army was mobilizing on the Manchurian border, and said that Russia did not want to interfere in the current Manchurian dispute. Today, the Japanese military announced that the troops sent to Juliuhe to suppress bandits have returned, because after going there, they learned that the bandits were scattered soldiers of the Chinese army.

When Zhang Hai-peng's vanguard was about to enter Qiqihar City, the Heilongjiang army immediately blew up the iron bridge in the area, and Zhang's army had no choice but to start fighting. It is heard that because Wan Fu-lin appointed Ma Zhan-shan, the Heihe garrison commander, as the chairman of the Heilongjiang government on the 14th, he has decided to attack Qiqihar. The fighting in that area is extremely fierce. (Japan United Press, 16th)</p>

<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Our Positions</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 14th, the Mongolian Commander Bao Ning-ting recruited more than a thousand Mongolian bandits, and was given weapons by the Japanese. They launched a large-scale attack on Zhangwu. When our army was in a fierce battle with the Mongolian bandits, Japan sent six aircraft to bomb our positions. Vice-Zhang received a report from Zhang Shu-sen, the commander of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade of Zhangwu, detailing the fierce battle, and requested a train of armored cars. Later, he received a telegram from Wang Zheng-bo, the magistrate of Tongliao County, stating that the Mongolian bandits are still entrenched in Daling, instigated by the Youth Party, and plan to occupy Tongliao as a base. Because Japanese troops come and go at uncertain times, the cavalry brigade has not been able to thoroughly suppress them. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Reliable information from the Railway Bureau states that after the Mongolian bandits in Tongliao were defeated and retreated, they counterattacked again on the morning of the 14th and were still repelled by the National Army. They have now retreated to the Nanduozi area, and the 3rd Brigade has sent a team to pursue them. Zhao, the company commander of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, was killed in the battle. One Mongolian bandit was captured and immediately shot. The rails, bridges, and power lines of the Tongliao North Station and East Station of the Si-Tao Railway were all burned. One track worker on the Beining Railway was injured. At about 1:00 pm on the same day, Japanese aircraft dropped two bombs on the north side of Tongliao South Station, but fortunately there were no casualties. A large number of bandits were found in Badaohao and Baiqibao. The bandit situation near Xinmin is especially serious. (Special Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The commander of the Zhangwu Cavalry Brigade telegraphed Vice-Zhang today that 500 Mongolian bandits attacked Tongliao on the early morning of the 14th.

The enemy abandoned 200 corpses and fled. The number of Chinese soldiers killed or injured is unknown. According to Commander Wang, when the battle was taking place, there were six Japanese aircraft in the air, apparently cooperating with the Mongolian bandits, dropping six bombs. It is heard that the Japanese troops did not participate in this operation, but if the Mongolian bandits continue to attack Tongliao, the Japanese troops may assist in the battle. According to unconfirmed Chinese sources, a Japanese aircraft bombarded the Tongliao railway station on the 15th with bombs, killing fourteen people. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Taonan telegram reports that the Japanese provided Er Deng Bu-la-qi, the leader of the soldiers under Boto Pule Tai Banner, with more than 3,000 rifles and millions of bullets.
