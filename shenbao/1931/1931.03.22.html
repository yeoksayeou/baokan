<p>德社會民主黨領袖穆勒氏。以患臟病逝世。德人稱穆氏爲人忠誠。勇於任事。富於犧牲之精神。亦德國身歷難危有關政局之有數人物也。考其秉政時代先任外交總長。簽定凡爾賽和約後。於一九二０年三月。由外交總長受命組閣。僅經三閱月即傾倒。是爲穆氏第一次組閣。一九二八年六月。復起組織第二次内閣。至一九三０年三月而倒。雖較第一次壽命稍長。然亦僅支持一年零九月之時間耳。且在此一年零九月之時間中。身當難局。危機屢起。閣員亦屢有變動。各黨員間意見極不一致。楊格計劃之一問題。競爭最烈。穆氏盡力支撑其間。以極誠摯之意旨。應付各方。雖幸能彌縫一時。卒因失業保險貯金問題之爭而倒。但穆氏之内閣雖倒。而德人今猶諒之。且社會民主黨之信任不衰。穆氏對於興登堡總統。亦仍能維持其友誼。遇事仍多所贊助。社會民主黨之今日得與政府黨提携。而不爲顯然反抗之行動者。以穆氏幹旋之力爲多。穆氏逝世而後。社會民主黨與政府間之關係。能維持不稍改變乎。則又須視白魯林之手腕何如矣。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>華北慈善聯合會委員長朱子橋君。對於陜災。熱心奔走。犧牲監察院委員職務。來滬募捐。情願再往入賬。本埠各界感其誠心。特組上海籌募陜災臨時急賬會。成立以來。成績甚佳。足徵惻隠之心。人皆有之。前晚朱君因離滬在即。設筳功德林蔬食處。公宴同鄉諸君。曁華商捲菸同業公會各委員。報告災况。請量力捐助。并介紹陜西省賬務委員會主席康寄遙君。與來賓相見。謂康君曾任陜西財政廳長。道德文章。人皆敬佩。近亦抛去政治生涯。專辦慈善事業。對於佛學。頗有研究。昨由陜西來滬。最近曾親往災地調查。所見情形。較鄙人兩月前在陜放賬時。更爲確切。故特請其出席報告。康君身體瘦長。穿呢袍玄褂。美鬌而持佛珠。年五十一。精神强健。驟視之。與滬上商界聞人聞蘭亭相似。是晚聞君適在隔室宴客。旁座某君。謂今晚不啻演雙包案。何以兩善士有如是相像耶。康君起立演說。先向來賓鞠躬。謂代陜省全體災民申謝。繼謂陜省災况。報載僅十分之二三。鄙人始接各縣分會報告。覺言之過甚。亦將信將疑。乃親往災區。實地調查。所見情形。殊爲慘痛。遙望荒田遍地皆是。非特餓殍載道。且積屍年餘。依舊暴露。無人收拾。試舉一二。已可想見。杏林鎭有一百家。八王村僅三十户。一則積屍五十餘。藏匿屋内。一則積屍二十餘。亦皆未埋。武林一縣。甚至有一萬三千餘屍。暴露荒野。無人顧問。回憶光緒二十六年。陜省亦大災。清廷曾撥巨欵以撫卹。但當時之災。尙無最近數年之重。時間亦無此次之長。現在赴鄉查災。數十里無人烟。不必用眼用耳。祗要用鼻。蓋鼻觸穢氣。即知該地積屍累累。災情重大。希望在座諸君。有力者量力捐助。無力者口角春風。佛說佈施之法有四。其功德則一。有錢捐欵。是爲財施。遇人勸募。是爲法施。恐人害怕。將語安慰。是爲無異施。無力帮忙。一念爲善。是爲心施云云。旋由曾因放賬而被匪所綁困守匪窟八十一日之查良釗君。報告在陜目擊情形。謂陜災之重。難以枚舉。將一二事提出。可知大槪。武功一縣。向甚繁盛。去年因醫馬病。欲購兩鷄蛋爲引子。遍覔數十里無着。蓋積屍未葬。飢民載途。所有樹皮草根。尙且吃盡。鷄犬無存。安有鷄子。以此推想。慘狀可知。其他種種。恐述後諸君食不下嚥。故不多贅。衆皆慘然。僉願量力捐欵。仍請朱查二君赴陜續放。九時始散。</p>

<p>— 謝勵吾</p>
<p>君姓汪。名鼎昇。字雪泉。世居皖歙仙村。君生時。父序之先生已逝。賴母氏徐太夫人。以長以敎。君頴悟異常兒。舉止類成人。年甫舞勺。習典業於如辠鄉。嗣至海門常樂鎭和濟典。旋擢錢席。繼任包缺。典中執事金君。常居滬。終年不一至。以故事無大小内外。惟君是賴。任勞者難免任怨矣。且居停門下。宵小當權。執役進退。每出喜怒。用排異已。君嘗仗義執言。致書居停。洋洋灑灑。理直氣壯。莫由稍抑之也。然以是益觸羣小之怒。　毁備加。致貶君爲鳥鎭之葆昌典司錢。君讀居停函。不怒而笑。復書殷殷致謝。惟以母老多病。懇辭職。是年冬。君果遄歸將母。並關小圃。蒔花疊石。雖無亭台樓閣之勝。萬山起伏。排闥送青。亦足怡情焉。君頗圖息影家園。讀書作畫。遂小隠之願。顧南潯劉澂如先生。雅慕君賢。亟欲羅致之。因凂人示意。君遂偕沈君侶夔往。接席未暖。相見恨晚。並以瀀溪莊事相界。該地民情狡猾。每多抗祖不納。君力加整頓。去其積弊。凡所籌畫。條理井然。租事因以大振。先生益嘉其能。深查倚重。去秋君家居時。面患疔毒。至險惡。識者咸爲君憂。卒頼藥石之功。得無恙君亦竊以自喜。欣然東下。詎知禍起不測。竟戕其生於異鄉耶。先是常州駐軍　　。竄入四鄉。十二月初四夜。突有匪衆至莊。恣意掠劫。君忠於職守。不欲以藏金輕示匪徒。致干囚燄。遂受槍傷。中要害。不及救。以十二月初七日申時。殁於武進醫院。鳴呼。痛哉。君敏而好學。篇翰斐然。尤長案牘。執業常樂時。南通張嗇公。經營交通。以和濟典屋。礙其航綫。擬令折讓。君具書力爭不屈。動中肯要。卒寢其議。君待人接物。藹然可親。尤任俠。好仗義。罹兹奇禍。悠悠蒼天。將謂之何。余共君遊久。詳其行誼爰爲傳之。微特著君嘉行。说所以塞吾悲也。（不受酬）</p>
<h3 id="c158">復旦女生同樂大會拾雋 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>江灣復旦大學女生宿舍。素以東宮馳名海上。而宮主則不自承。頃乃組織女同學會。藉爲進德修業之助。前夕假座膳堂。舉行同樂大會。釵光鬌影。盛極一時。幕啓由梁培樹女士主席。范同璋女士紀錄。行禮如儀。議决要案多起。末乃媵以游藝。載歌載舞。妙絶人寰。兹拾雋聞。以實本談。</p>
<p>游藝旣作。首博掌聲者爲王保敏女士之京調　頭鳳。王女士二八年華。兩辫　肩。音容婉妙。稚態可掬。初試歌喉。響遏行雲。一座嘆絶。聞王女士曾從名票遊。故每歌輙令人有此曲祇應天上有之感。能劇甚多。本期將卒業於社會學系。稱高才生焉。</p>
<p>繼爲男女滑稽舞。周昌鳴女士易　而弁。宛然　眉氣槪。李素貞女士則飾一鄉女。合串却爾斯登舞。故作錯亂。以博客笑。帶唱鳳陽花鼓。合座爲之粲然。此種融化中外之歌舞。亦清新。亦雋永。殊饒興趣。故舞止而再來一個一之聲猶不絶也。</p>
<p>再次爲土洋人演講。前此尊貴莊嚴之主席梁培樹女士。飾一腐敗老先生出。同行者爲一滑稽土洋人。係新聞學系郭箴一女士所飾。郭女士以土洋話演講。梁女士以揚州白繙繹之。神情口腔。無不令人捧腹。兩女士中英語言兼長。着着臻於化境。</p>
<p>最後爲郭箴一范同璋二女士之雙簧。郭女士原籍湖北。乃飾一湖北小姑娘。自稱其選。范女士本鄞縣產。飾一寗波大姑娘進城。满口阿拉。聞者絶倒。</p>
<p>游藝節目甚多。尙有胡和平歐陽美德諸女士之歌舞。無不稱妙。至十時許乃盡歡而散。聞該會近發起上海女青年勵志社。已徵得各大學女同學會之贊同。由郭箴一梁培樹王保敏諸女士代表出席。三八國際婦女紀念節即該社所召集。將來大會必更有大規模之游藝云。</p>

<p>— 舍予</p>
<p>邇來各影戲院。競映新片。層出不窮。可稱盛極一時。其中以聲片尤有來源暢旺之勢。惜多偏重神性理想一類。而能有刺戟性之情節片。轉不多見。華龍路巴黎影院。素以精選默片著稱。地位旣佳。座價復廉。故營業發逹。突過以前紀錄。月前該院經理韓君謂將採映聲片。昨日柬請報界參觀試映女性的消遣。乃其所選之聲片也。片爲俄國之大明星主演。情節係一車夫。因受一貴婦一度誘惑。致使完好家庭。頓現分裂之象。子喪妻遁。迨至再造婦居。希獲安慰。不意婦與車夫。僅屬一時消遣。並非眞愛。故以冷眼相拒。更遭多人譏笑。表演深刻之處。極其透澈。映寫社會階級。各個情形。亦襯顯得異常着力。吾知觀衆觀此片後。必能領會此片命名。實寓有不少警惕之意義也。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>十一月十三日下午三時上船赴印度加爾吉打Caiciitta其碼頭在Latt。。王芳圓帶其小兒爲送行照料一切。陳義通同日同檳城。余守熱帶應坐三等艙之　。買票十六元。五點開船。離仰光埠。初向東行。折向南。入孟加拉灣大洋。向西天印度去矣。</p>
<p>十四日。海水遠望似黑色。若吾渤海南之黑水洋。在船中甚適。無風。船皆印人華人只三兩人耳。有一粤女。家於印度也。又一古董商商於加城者。熱帶大抵飲生水。余亦飲慣。甚適宜。且可冲凉。大船勝於小輪也。船中賣各食物者甚多。若吃印度飯。四安一頓。甚便宜。余觀察印人之衣服問題。漸覺其有不需要之勢。印人無所謂衣服。只披一疋布。纏於全身耳。特其纏有定法。如中國畫式之觀音裝。乃全仿印度婦人裝也。印度人衣服問題。只一疋布足用。冬季加一毯。夜蓋畫即披之。亦可作大禮服用。赴任何宴會。其平常人畫夜一疋布已足。若求清潔。則二疋布可换洗。今一般印人。皆用甘地不合作方法。自織老布而自用之。一切洋貨不銷行。故英國機器無用武之地。然亦因印人衣服本無問題。故甘地之敎易行也。</p>
<p>十六晨八時已到加城。余行李箱三件。搜查甚嚴。不管護照。而查文字。貨物下岸。苦力用一元半呌一馬車。至大乘佛會一元半MahaBodbiSocietyegeSquare此佛會創於一九八二年逹磨波羅Phdanagarih英倫紐約均有分會。現在沙拿地方正新建第一佛寺。并設大學。中國太虚法師允送學生十名。每月出英文報一册。有藏書樓閱報社。出版佛書。相片不少。願買者可照上列地址匯欵去買。其樓上爲佛堂。繪佛歷史甚可觀。入堂禮佛。必脫鞋。但其樓用斯門江塗。極潔凈無塵也。此會所建築等費。凡五萬元。初時所以能創辦者一檀香山女士。MrsMlirry捐八萬元故也。</p>
<p>十七日訪盧領事春芳及黨部王志遠。此地華僑　粤人。尙無報館。正在經營中而中國街乃印度右時舊巷。甚陋隘矣。有甚貧者。陋如吾國之貧户。然來印度之人民。似多久住及數世者也。有廣東大酒店。規模頗大。陳正平爲經理。余在其處見西人來食者多。亦有印度富人成對而來。衣服可觀。甘地主義亦難遍行於富人耳。</p>

<p>Saying the Scope of the Conference Has Expanded</p>
<p>The Duration of the Time Is Especially Difficult to Predict</p>
<p>Harbin, today at 3:05 PM, the delegation's special train departed for Russia. Many people from all walks of life came to the station to see them off. More than a hundred people, including Zhang Jinghui, an important figure in the Special District, all went to the station to see them off. Russian, Japanese, British, and French consuls also arrived. Moduhui arrived at the station at 2:40 PM to rest and boarded the train at 2:50 PM. When the train departed, the military band played loudly, and the crowd shouted, "Long live the Sino-Russian Conference! Long live the Republic of China! May the plenipotentiary Moduhui's diplomacy be smooth and heroic!" (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin, Moduhui's special train prepared for departure to Russia included one flower car for Moduhui and his wife, two official cars, three first- and second-class sleeper cars, and one dining car. The entourage boarded the train at 2 PM. The Chief of General Affairs and the Chief of Funds from the East Railway Bureau will travel back to their country with Moduhui on the special train, as they will be appointed as important members of the Russian delegation. Today, merchants and civilians who came to the station to see Moduhui off all held flags, two people per household, and the same for schools. The central government has allocated 60,000 yuan per month for the delegation's expenses, and 50,000 yuan has already been transferred from Liaoning to Russia. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin, Moduhui told reporters that our side has shown great sincerity in this conference. As long as Russia also treats us with this attitude, the future can be optimistic. However, the scope of the conference has expanded, and three groups, the Eastern Railway, Commerce, and Resumption of Relations, will proceed simultaneously. Everyone knows that the Eastern Railway and the Resumption of Relations issues are complex. The matter of commerce has countless details and requires a longer period of negotiation. The economic relationship between China and the Soviet Union is extremely close. Since both sides now take equal commerce as the principle, every single item should seek fairness in discussion. When concluding treaties, we must be cautious. Therefore, the duration of the conference is especially difficult to predict. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Qian Tai, a special envoy of the Commerce Committee of the Sino-Soviet Conference, remains in Beijing due to illness and is still recuperating. He will go to Russia after he has fully recovered at a later time. (21st dispatch)</p>

<p>Mr. Muller, the leader of the German Social Democratic Party, has passed away due to a heart condition. Germans describe Muller as loyal, brave, and willing to sacrifice. He was also one of the few figures in German politics who experienced difficulties and crises. During his time in power, he first served as Foreign Minister and signed the Treaty of Versailles. In March 1920, he was ordered by the Foreign Minister to form a cabinet. It collapsed after only three months. This was Muller's first time forming a cabinet. In June 1928, he rose again to form a second cabinet, which lasted until March 1930. Although it lasted slightly longer than the first, it only lasted for one year and nine months. Moreover, during this one year and nine months, he faced difficulties and crises arose frequently. The opinions of the cabinet members were also very different. The Young Plan was the most fiercely contested issue. Muller tried his best to support it and dealt with all parties with utmost sincerity. Although he managed to patch things up temporarily, he eventually collapsed due to a dispute over the unemployment insurance savings fund. However, even though Muller's cabinet collapsed, Germans still understand him today. And the trust of the Social Democratic Party has not waned. Muller was also able to maintain his friendship with President Hindenburg and often provided support in matters. The fact that the Social Democratic Party today is able to cooperate with the ruling party and not take obvious rebellious actions is largely due to Muller's efforts. After Muller's death, will the relationship between the Social Democratic Party and the government be able to maintain without any change? It will depend on the skills of Brüning.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e51">German-Austrian Economic Agreement Established <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Customs and administration are separate, but tax revenues are shared by both countries. The National Government in Berlin telegraphed on the 21st that the governments of Germany and Austria have concluded a new commercial agreement stipulating that all import and export taxes for the trade of goods between the two countries will be abolished. This is a new starting point for the economic and commercial integration of the two countries, which will greatly benefit the progress of the European Economic Federation. The new agreement has been fully approved by the governments of both countries and will soon be submitted to the parliament for final approval. The full text will be published on Monday. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed its ambassadors to the UK, France, and Italy to notify the governments of the three countries of its contents. However, according to important political figures here, this agreement does not affect the political and economic sovereignty of the two countries, nor does it violate the Treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain. Its effect is only to merge the customs duties of Germany and Austria, so as to remove tariff barriers between the two countries and bind the commercial agreements and tariff policies of the two countries to coordinate with each other. Moreover, during a certain transition period, Austria is still allowed to adopt a gradually reduced tariff on the entry of certain German handicrafts. Therefore, this agreement cannot be regarded as a preparatory step for the political merger of Germany and Austria, but can be regarded as the core of the European Economic Federation. In the future, other countries will be invited to join, so that it can gradually develop and bear good fruit. Furthermore, the customs administrations of the two countries will still be completely separate from each other, but after a certain period of time, their income will be shared once according to the population ratio. Although the establishment of this agreement has no direct impact on politics, it can be regarded as a first-class event in Europe.</p>

<p>Nothing more than actively expanding war preparations. French fiscal revenue exceeds budget. Reuter reported from Paris on the 20th that the French government's naval construction plan has been submitted to the Naval Committee of the House of Representatives, including a new 23,000-ton battleship that can overwhelm German pocket battleships. The plan advocates a total of 45,000 tons of ships, in addition to the 23,000-ton battleship equipped with eleven 9-inch guns, there are two cruisers with a displacement of 7,500 tons equipped with five 5-inch guns, and the remaining tonnage is for scout ships and destroyer fleet command ships.</p>

<p>Dentsu telegraphed from Tokyo on the 21st that the motion of no confidence proposed by the opposition party in response to the outside-of-parliament overthrow the cabinet rally has been rejected. Important bills that were initially expected to run aground in the House of Representatives have all been passed in one go. However, important bills in the House of Peers are still piled up like mountains. The government will do its best to promote the passage of all bills.</p>
<p>Dentsu telegraphed from Tokyo on the 21st that after the motion of no confidence in the cabinet was rejected, General Affairs Director Shimada of the Seiyukai said to people, "Although the motion of no confidence was rejected by a majority, we are confident that we have fully achieved our goal. The debate up to today has made the government completely ineffective. The more it stays for one day, the more the country will suffer for one day. This has been clearly seen by the people. Although important bills have passed the House of Representatives, even if they are fully established, they will be of no benefit to the people. The majority of 270 is equivalent to a puppet. In the near future, there will be political changes. The Seiyukai's policy of establishing the country through industry will soon be realized." Secretary-General Sakuraichi of the Minseito Party said to people, "The reason for the Seiyukai's motion of no confidence is extremely weak. Its rejection by a large majority is a matter of course and is sufficient to prove the people's trust in the current cabinet."</p>

<h3 id="e62">He Jian Advises He Ying Group to Return <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The group sent personnel to the province to show their sincerity. Hu Dechun will succeed as the group leader. Changsha correspondence - He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army, this time submitted for approval by the General Headquarters to reorganize the Fourth Route Army and separately reorganize and merge the units. Among them, the First Group of He Ying, belonging to Dai Huiyuan, commander of the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression Command and commander of the Independent 10th Brigade, was reorganized into the 16th Division Training Group, ordering it to be stationed in Yuezhou for reorganization and bandit suppression. Unexpectedly, the group suddenly acted freely when it was transferred from Changde to the province of Yue. He Jian arrested and interrogated Dai Hongxun, the deputy brigade commander of the brigade, on suspicion of inciting the incident. He Ying, the leader of the He group, was not involved in this incident. Therefore, after the change, the battalion commanders unanimously elected battalion commander Teng Dairong to temporarily act as the group leader to preside over everything. It was originally planned to go to Shupu, but because Anhua and Shupu were blocked by troops, they fled to the Jianting Yima Dianyi area in Taoyuan County. Recently, the group also knew that it had been surrounded and could not stand. Therefore, battalion commander Tian Xigeng was specially appointed as the representative to come to the province to show his sincerity, explaining that the group's change this time was due to being incited by others and was a last resort. Now they have repented, and all officers and soldiers are willing to return. Please forgive them for their wrongdoing and allow them to reform, and request that Hu Dechun be sent to preside over the leadership (Hu is from Fenghuang County, and the officers and soldiers of the group are also from Fenghuang, so they welcome Hu). He Jian believed that the group should be punished for violating military discipline for acting freely without listening to orders, but considering that they were all old troops of Dai Douyuan, Dai died in battle while suppressing the communists in Wenjia City, Liuyang, and his body has not been found to this day. The tragedy of his death is no less than that of Zhang Hui. He could not bear to make a decisive decision out of his old feelings. In addition, Xiangxi generals Li Guojun and others telegraphed one after another to plead for leniency and approve his request, and sent Hu Dechun to collect and appease the troops, temporarily gather them in Taoyuan to reorganize and wait for orders. After the collection and appeasement is completed, Hu will be formally appointed as the group leader and transferred to Yuezhou. At the same time, he issued a letter to the officers and soldiers of the group in the name of the commander-in-chief, with extremely sincere wording. The full text is recorded as follows: Battalion Commander Tian Xigeng came to the province and learned that the officers and soldiers of the group had misunderstandings about the previous merger order, and that villains had seized the opportunity to incite them, resulting in their actions being out of line. According to national law and military discipline, they should be severely punished, but considering that they have been with each other for several years and were the old troops of the late Deputy Division Commander Jinmen (Douyuan) of Dai and the late Group Commander Yingtang of Tian, they could not bear to make a decisive decision. You must know that the previous merger order was originally issued by the Commander-in-Chief. At this time, the whole country is in a slump, and the reduction in tariff revenue is sharp. There are too many troops in Xiangjing, and the source of salaries is almost exhausted. In order to streamline the army and save military expenses, it is necessary to implement a contraction policy. The economic transparency of this route army has long been known, and the salaries of all division, brigade, and group officers and soldiers are all issued by a commission. However, the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression Command has too many extra officers and soldiers, and there are too many monks and not enough porridge. Therefore, the officers and soldiers often cannot receive the full amount issued by this headquarters. This commander-in-chief could not bear to treat the same troops unequally, so he incorporated the group into the 16th Division in the hope of treating each group equally. The officers and soldiers of the group originally belonged to the troops of the late Deputy Division Commander Jinmen of Dai. Since the battle of western Hubei in the 15th year of the Republic of China, they have been with each other for six years, and they have made outstanding contributions in suppressing rebellion and bandits. There is no estrangement in the whole heart. If they are incited by others and are ignorant of righteousness, not only will their previous achievements be abandoned, but also a stain will be left on the glorious history of the late Deputy Division Commander Dai's martyrdom. In short, the revolutionary army is the military force of the people and not a tool for one or two private individuals. It cannot be easily used for instigation and utilization to violate the orders of superiors and bring about self-destruction. If they can repent early and return together, they will not be blamed for the past and their previous achievements will be in place. Their future achievements and names will still be encouraged together, and their rations and salaries will be issued as appropriate. If they are still obsessed and self-reliant, then the country has constant punishments and the army has discipline. The distinction between obedience and disobedience is always clear and it will be difficult to escape. Sincere words are given to each of you to know and obey. Commander-in-Chief He Jian (March 18)</p>

However, military operations are being kept strictly confidential and cannot be known. Furthermore, the Local Reorganization Committee, in order to quickly restore order in the recaptured areas, has also sent personnel to advance with the army. (March 16)</p>

<p>Principal and interest of over 860,000 yuan, to be paid off in twenty years.  Jinan Correspondence. In recent years, Shandong Province has been plagued by many incidents, and the expenses have been enormous. It has repeatedly borrowed money from local banks and money houses to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>Among them, Zhang Zongchang's excessive borrowing and abuse were the most prominent. Successive provincial governments have failed to clear them up, resulting in endless increases in principal and interest. As of the end of December of the eighteenth year, it has reached more than 867,590 yuan (in addition, there are 75,000 yuan from Hengda and Fuyuan money houses). The banks and money houses have repeatedly appealed and pleaded for repayment. The current Director of Finance, Wang Xiangrong, has drafted an amortization plan to pay it off in twenty years starting from this year, which will be included in the budget. This proposal has been approved by the Provincial Government Standing Committee today (17th). The proposal of the Finance Department is recorded as follows: Case No. 1: Regarding the case of the former Shandong government owing various loans to banks and money houses in this province, the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications had previously submitted registers and requested repayment. The Finance Department had already forwarded them to the Provincial Government in February of the nineteenth year and handed them over to the Economic and Financial Reorganization Committee for discussion. Subsequently, the committee divided the various loans into four categories and approved or rejected them separately, and submitted them to the Provincial Government for orders to the Finance Department. The Finance Department then forwarded them to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications for verification. According to the original resolution, the various loans belonging to the first category were approved to be repaid in installments due to accumulated government expenses, and interest should be paid at the original interest rate until the end of December of the eighteenth year. Furthermore, from the date of the contract, no compound interest should be calculated. The Finance Department should issue interest-free treasury bonds to be amortized evenly in twenty years starting from the nineteenth year and included in the budget, and the treasury should pay in installments. All these instructions were followed by the former Director Yuan. Subsequently, Dao Sheng Bank and others presented a case requesting the repayment of the loan. The Provincial Government successively sent it to the Economic Reorganization Committee for joint review, but it was interrupted because the committee was ordered to be abolished. After a detailed investigation, the ten loans from Dao Sheng Bank and others were found to be under the same contract as the first category of loans from the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. Since the bank requested it by citing the previous case, it is proposed that the interest be calculated until the end of December of the eighteenth year, and the principal and interest should be paid off in twenty years according to the method of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. All repayment procedures should be handled according to the regulations of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. The total principal and interest is more than 867,590 yuan. In addition, there are 75,000 yuan borrowed from Hengda and Zhuyuan money houses. After investigation, they are government expenses and are all individual loans, not within the loan contracts of various banks. One is related to the debt of the Finance Department, and the other is that most of the loans have been repaid, and the remaining loans are in urgent need of clearing. The numbers have repeatedly reported losses and closures, and earnestly request for rapid repayment. The Finance Department has re-examined and found it to be true. Now, in consideration of the special circumstances of the numbers, it is proposed to repay all principal and interest of the two numbers in advance in order to maintain credit and show solicitude. Furthermore, the principal and interest owed by the ten places such as Dao Sheng Bank should be allocated according to the method of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications for twenty years. Starting from the twentieth year, 43,380 yuan should be included in the budget each year. As for the principal and interest of 116,250 yuan owed by Hengda and Fuyuan money houses as of the end of December of the eighteenth year, it is proposed to include it in the special expenses of the nineteenth year's budget for unified disbursement and repayment. A joint statement is made on whether the proposal is appropriate. The list of proposals is respectfully submitted for public decision (the attached table is omitted).</p>
<h3 id="e67">Lu Provincial Government Reduces the Number of People's Militias in Various Counties <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, departed from Ji'nan on the 12th to inspect the counties in northern Shandong. It is reported that after Han arrived in Linyi on the 15th, he sent a telegram to Zhang Shaotang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, and Li Shuchun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, ordering them to reduce the number of people's militias in various counties to alleviate the burden on the people. Because there are many bandits in Shandong, the original garrison troops in various counties were changed to police teams during Chen Tiaoyuan's tenure. Last year, when Han took charge of Shandong, they were changed to people's militias again. The province was divided into four general command headquarters for the people's militia, and the public security bureaus in various counties transferred most of their firearms to the people's militia. If it was not enough, the local authorities were ordered to purchase them, and the salaries were also provided by the local authorities. In various counties, it is necessary to increase the burden, and the people's militia has become a disguised army, and the county government has no power to dispatch it, and the command is particularly inconvenient. Therefore, the people's organizations and county party headquarters in various counties have sent telegrams to the provincial government, either requesting the abolition of the people's militia or requesting the improvement of the organization. The provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs did not immediately approve because they did not understand the local situation. Now that Han has arrived in northern Shandong to inspect and investigate, he knows that the previous requests from various counties are not deliberately alarmist and that there is indeed an urgent need for improvement. Therefore, there is this telegram. The telegram is recorded as follows: After several days of investigation, the burden on the people in various counties is too heavy. The people's militia and battalion headquarters should be reduced by one-half according to the current number of people in order to relieve the people's difficulties. The measures are listed below: (1) Large counties should retain 150 people, medium counties 100 people, and small counties 50 people or more, including those transferred by the command headquarters. (2) It is best to arrange or dismiss the surplus officers and soldiers on the spot. If there is really no way, they should all be sent to the province for other plans, but the badges, symbols, and clothing should all be collected. (3) All surplus firearms should be sent back to the local public security bureau for use. (4) The provincial government should announce that this measure is purely to relieve the people's suffering and reduce the burden on the people in a detailed and clear manner so that the people can understand it. (5) The provincial government should send letters to the provincial and county party headquarters, ordering the county magistrates and directors of finance bureaus to clarify this meaning. (6) Strictly order the people's militia commanders, county magistrates, and people's militia team headquarters to complete the reduction by the end of this month. Those who dare to delay will be punished severely. (7) The new establishment will be implemented on April 1. Please investigate and handle it quickly. Han Fuqu, deleted and printed (16th).</p>

<p>Planning for autonomous expenses; implementing the treasury system. Fuzhou Correspondence. Zheng Baoqing, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, stated that the province's original autonomous expenses were allocated from the surcharge on grain and land taxes. After the suspension of autonomy, the funds were transferred to the police force expenses of various counties. A small number of counties raised some funds locally, but due to changes in circumstances, they either stopped collecting or diverted them for other uses, so that the current autonomous expenses can be said to be unavailable. However, the current local governance guidelines are based on local autonomy, so it is decided to follow the orders of the Ministry and tentatively allocate a minimum of 250,000 yuan annually from the taxes paid by various counties to the province as autonomous expenses. The insufficient amount will be raised locally by various counties. As for the training of autonomous talents, the expenses of the institutions will also be reduced as much as possible, and it is estimated that it will cost more than 10,000 yuan from the start to the end. It is now planned to proceed.</p>
<p>Among the autonomous regions in various counties, 50 counties have reported their plans, divided into 312 districts. There are still 14 counties that have not reported their plans. For the counties that have not yet been divided, the average number of districts in each county is estimated to be 112 districts. Combined with the 312 districts that have already been divided, the total number of districts in the province should be in the range of 424 districts. The monthly expenses for each district are tentatively estimated at the lowest amount of 150 yuan, which is 1,800 yuan. The monthly expenses for 424 districts are 63,600 yuan, which is 763,200 yuan annually. The annual allocation of 250,000 yuan is transferred from the taxes paid by various counties to the province (still short of 513,200 yuan, which is raised locally by various counties within the scope of not violating current laws and regulations). Only 20,000 yuan is allocated to each of the 64 counties each month. On average, each county only allocates more than 300 yuan each month.</p>
<p>Director of Finance He Gonggan is planning to unify the province's income. Recently, he slightly revised the Treasury Regulations, the Cashier Regulations, and the Organizational Outline, and withdrew the original plan set by the former Director Xu Fu. The newly revised Provincial Treasury Regulations establish a director who is responsible for all affairs, and two sections for accounting and cashier. For the revenue and expenditure procedures, all local revenues in the province are collected by the Provincial Treasury. For cash expenditures, the payment order and payment notice issued by the Department of Finance must be checked to ensure that the numbers match, and the receipt of the receiving agency must be obtained before payment can be made. The Department of Construction and Education and the Municipal Public Security Bureau have directly appointed Du Luzhong, Wang Xiaoquan, and Zhuang Kaowen to receive the revenue starting from April 1 (March 14).</p>

<p>Bengbu Correspondence. After Zhu Peide, Chief of the General Staff, arrived in Bengbu yesterday morning (19th), he inspected the 45th Division of Wei Lihuang in the morning, accompanied by Wu Qingzhi, Director of the First Review Class, and committee members Shen Zheng and Jin Jifang. Before 7:00 am, the units of the division gathered at the Bengshan South Airport. There were Li Mo'an's 133rd Brigade, Fu Yikun's 265th Regiment, Wang Renqu's 266th Regiment, Xu Dunrong's 267th Regiment, Li Shusen's 135th Brigade, Long Qiwu's 268th Regiment, Jiang's Regiment, Chen Buyun's Independent Brigade, Li Xian's Second Regiment, Du Zhicheng's Third Regiment, and direct subordinate units such as the Engineer Battalion, Artillery Battalion, Transport Battalion, Cavalry Company, and Special Service Company, totaling more than 10,000 people. The brigades and regiments stood vertically on the east side of the parade ground facing west, and the direct subordinate units stood horizontally on the south side of the parade ground facing north. The reviewing stand was set up on the west side facing east. The whole army lined up in order and waited for Zhu's arrival. At about 9:00 am, Zhu, accompanied by senior staff Yan Xiji and others, departed from the 45th Division Headquarters in Tangyuan and went straight to the airport. Review Director Wu Qingzhi et al., and 45th Division Commander Wei Lihuang, Chief of Staff Chen Guojun, Chief of Staff Guo Jijiao, Section Chief Jiang Xiang, Zhong Chuping, Staff Zhang Renrui, and others accompanied them. Zhang Lisheng, Commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division stationed in Bengbu, also accompanied them to the scene. The 45th Division distributed posts along the way, and the security was very strict. Zhu et al. drove to the intersection of the parade ground, got off the bus, and entered the parade ground on horseback. All the soldiers saluted him with their guns, and the military band played music to pay tribute. Bai Zhaocong, Deputy Commander of the 45th Division, who was in charge of the general command, first patrolled on horseback, and then ordered the parade to begin. Zhu Peide patrolled on horseback, accompanied by Wei Lihuang, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Guojun, and others. Amidst the melodious sound of military music, the troops were inspected in order. The troops were neat and tidy, and their spirits were excellent. After the parade, Zhu et al. dismounted and successively ascended the reviewing stand. The general commander ordered the march-past to begin. The troops marched past the reviewing stand in order, paying attention to Zhu. After the march-past, the field exercise began. The cadres, platoons, and squads were selected for training, and the reviewing committee members reviewed the officers and soldiers separately. Their movements were quick and their changes were proficient. It was not until 12:00 noon that it ended. Zhu then went straight to the station to return to his special train for rest. Wei Lihuang et al. and the officers and soldiers of the troops also returned in order. At 1:30 pm, the troops gathered at the airport again, waiting for the review to be completed. Staff members of the division headquarters accompanied the reviewing committee members to the scene to review the personnel, horses, firearms, and ammunition separately. Zhu did not go. It ended at 6:00 pm. In the evening, Wei Lihuang hosted a banquet at the Tangyuan Division Headquarters to welcome Zhu and the reviewing committee members, accompanied by senior military officers. The banquet ended at 9:00 pm (20th).</p>
<h3 id="e70">Wang Jun's Admonition to the 7th Division <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence. After Wang Jun inspected the 37th, 38th, 41st, and 42nd Regiments and direct subordinate units of the 7th Division stationed in Xuzhou at Jiulishan on the 9th, he went to Fuliji on the 15th to inspect the 39th Regiment, and on the 18th, he went to Dangshan to inspect the 40th Regiment. He returned to Xuzhou on the same day. Wang has completed the inspection of all units of the 7th Division. He has made comments on the strengths and weaknesses of the battalion-company system, combat training, and internal inspections of various arms of service at any time. He specifically issued the following admonition to all officers of the division: The merits and demerits of the various units in the indoor and outdoor fields have been explained in detail. The points that should be reformed must be earnestly improved by the officers to achieve perfection. However, the mission and responsibility of a soldier are extremely important and great. Officers must be able to set an example for their subordinates in peacetime training and organization so that they can command effectively in wartime. Therefore, the cultivation of personal academic skills and the tempering of temperament are extremely important. I would like to mention a few points for your consideration: 1. Party Principles: The Premier created the Three Principles of the People to save the country and the people. Therefore, although warlords such as Sun, Wu, Yan, and Feng possessed heavy troops and occupied dangerous positions, looking down upon the Central Plains, they were defeated and disintegrated as soon as they were attacked. In a few years, our revolutionary army was able to unify the country. This is not entirely due to the progress of military affairs. In fact, the Premier's principles are the reason for this. Therefore, we, as officers in leadership positions, feel the need to understand the Party Principles more clearly. Now the Commander-in-Chief has issued Mr. Dai's "The Philosophical Basis of Sun Wen's Doctrine," which extracts the essence of the Premier's writings and demonstrates the principles and implementation methods of the Three Principles of the People. It is a model for us to study the Party Principles. All officers should read and practice this article carefully in order to maintain the established achievements and accomplish the entire revolutionary cause. 2. Academics: Since officers are examples for soldiers, their academic knowledge must be sufficient to guide their subordinates. The典範令(a military order) is the standard for our soldiers. It should be thoroughly understood. If the soldiers are trained according to the principles in peacetime, they will be able to deal with the situation and kill the enemy effectively in wartime. 3. Spirit: The philosophers of the past said that spirit is the mother of事业(career/undertaking). Even if we have excellent academics and a clear understanding of the Party Principles for the revolutionary mission, it will be useless if we do not have the spirit to lead and persevere. However, spirit is actually obtained through training. The method of training lies in the health of the body and the clarity of the mind. Therefore, the Premier created the theory of "Knowing is Difficult, Doing is Easy" and the Commander-in-Chief issued the "Must-Know for Revolutionary Soldiers" in order to make our revolutionary soldiers recognize the doctrine and move forward with courage, etc. (19th).</p>
<h3 id="e71">Wu Tiecheng's Statement on Being Appointed as Police Commissioner <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence. The National Government decided on the 13th to establish a Police Commissioner under the Executive Yuan to manage the national police affairs. The Public Security Bureaus of the provinces and cities are under the command and supervision of the Police Commissioner. Wu Tiecheng has been specially appointed as the Police Commissioner, as reported earlier. The reporter visited Wu's residence at noon on the 16th to ask when he would take office. Wu said that the Central Government has ended the military period and started the tutelage period. From now on, military preparations are completely for national defense, and the police are peaceful soldiers maintaining local responsibility. The responsibilities should be transferred to the police. All aspects of promoting government orders, clearing the countryside, investigating autonomy, and elections are important tasks to complete the tutelage period and achieve the constitutional period. The preparation for the recovery of legal rights cannot be successful without the efforts and assistance of a perfect organization and fully capable police agencies. At present, the police system in our country is not only independent in various places, but also due to the impact of military affairs over the years, its organization, equipment, training, allocation, etc. are mostly simple and crude. If it is not improved, it will be difficult to achieve uniformity. The Central Government, in view of this, has long had the intention to establish a Police Commissioner to manage the national police. President Chiang and the Central Committee comrades also consulted me on the position of Commissioner. Although I have been in charge of police affairs in Guangdong for many years, the responsibility is different now than in the past, and my ability is weak. I am afraid that I will not be able to handle this difficult task. Moreover, my inspection mission has not been completed, and the organizational law of the Police Commissioner's Office is still being drafted. The matter of taking office is not yet in the talk (March 16).</p>

<p>The Liaoning Provincial Government approves the Ministry of Finance's consultation to transfer to the Harbin District, ordering the bank's liquidation office to verify and return the money. Shenyang Correspondence. The debt of US$20,000 owed by the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank to the Harbin Branch of the former China Maoye Bank has not been repaid. The two banks have long been closed and are in the process of liquidation. Now, the Maoye General Liquidation Office has submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, which was transferred to Liaoning. The Liaoning Provincial Government has consulted the Harbin Special District Governor's Office, ordering the Daosheng Harbin Branch Liquidation Office to verify the amount and return it in full. The text of the Provincial Government's consultation to the Special District Governor's Office is recorded as follows: The Ministry of Finance has approved the case. The General Liquidation Office of China Maoye Bank stated in the report that the Harbin Branch of Maoye has a balance of US$20,000 owed by the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank, which has not been repaid. Later, the Liquidation Office of the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank stated in a letter that the Zhenwei General's Office issued a telegram in February of the sixteenth year, stating that a General Liquidation Office was established to implement the liquidation affairs of the Daosheng Bank within China, including the branches in the three northeastern provinces, etc. However, since the office was liquidated, Maoye Bank has only received 10% of the total amount of the debt. Although the office has repeatedly sent letters to the General and Branch Liquidation Offices of the three northeastern provinces and entrusted Lawyer Lv Pan of Harbin to contact the Harbin Liquidation Branch, they all made excuses and procrastinated. Lawyer Lv also stated in a letter that the liquidation methods of the office were extremely inconsistent. For example, the debts owed by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Dong Province Official Money Bureau have all been repaid. However, Maoye Bank has only received 10%, which is unbalanced. Moreover, Maoye is currently in the process of liquidation, and both creditors' rights and debts should be settled in a short period of time. After careful consideration, it is requested that your ministry send a letter to the highest administrative organ of Dong Province, informing the General Liquidation Office of the Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank in the province to quickly repay the US$20,000 owed by the Harbin Branch of Maoye Bank in full, following the example of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Dong Province Official Money Bureau, in order to facilitate the liquidation. According to this, the statements in the original report are true. It is appropriate to consult your provincial government to investigate and order compliance. And hope to reply by consultation to the government for referral. (March 17).</p>

<p>Wang Huaichen and other fellow villagers from Lu'an, Anhui Province, in Beijing, previously reported that Lu'an had suffered from a mutiny again, and the refugees were devastated after the mutiny. They sent a telegram to the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting a quick and proper settlement, and requesting the Accounting Committee to allocate funds to save the orphans. They have now received replies from Chen Tiaoyuan and the Accounting Committee, agreeing to do so. The telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Tiaoyuan's reply telegram: To Wang Houzhai and Gao Yihan of the Nanjing Judicial Administration Department, transfer to Zhang Qi, Wang Wu, and other gentlemen. I have received the Xunyan Jian telegram. A few soldiers who were stationed in Lu'an to suppress the communist bandits scattered and returned to the team after a few days. Unexpectedly, they were trapped by the bandits and incited by the bandits, which led to this incident. They were immediately dispersed and many were captured. It has now been pacified and restored to its original state. After the incident, the provincial government immediately transferred the 4,000 yuan allocated by the Relief Committee for emergency relief, and the General Command allocated 5,000 yuan to send personnel to provide relief. The circumstances of the incident and the handling of relief have been reported. The county has been ordered to properly arrange the settlement, and the General Command has sent a strong force to protect the area. I hope you will be relieved. Sincerely, Chen Tiaoyuan.</p>
<p>Reply from the Accounting Committee: Respectfully replying to your letter. The case was approved. I received a letter from the Finance Bureau and other agencies of Lu'an County, Anhui Province, stating that Lu'an has recently suffered a major disaster with heavy losses. I hope that you will consider the orphans after the mutiny and quickly allocate huge funds to provide relief. The Lu'an funds were previously allocated 3,500 yuan from the 30,000 yuan allocated by the Anhui funds. Subsequently, the Anhui Government and the Provincial Relief Association repeatedly reported that the disaster in Anhui Province was severe and requested additional relief funds. After additional allocation of 4,000 yuan, 500 yuan was allocated to Lu'an, totaling 4,000 yuan, which was handed over to He Chongjie, the association's loan specialist, to jointly investigate and distribute with the personnel sent by the provincial government. This time, Lu'an suffered another disaster. I am deeply saddened. Now, the association will allocate another 6,000 yuan in funds and send personnel to investigate and distribute the funds to save the orphans. In addition to sending telegrams separately, I will reply by letter and hope that you will investigate and handle it.</p>

According to the confession, he was 31 years old and lived in Qinghe Bridge, three miles outside the West Gate of Liyang. After the case occurred, he was detained by the county government and released by his uncle Ge Leshan and his brother Ge Zihua. He is currently working in the Jinpu Road Machinery Office in Jinan, Shandong, introduced by his cousin who is an engineer on the road.

<p>Ancient Tomb in Nan Yuan is Robbed. The Wuzhong Tomb Protection Association reported to Yizhi that four coffins of lacquered Nanmu wood were found excavated in the Caodian side behind the Xinsu Farm on Nan Yuan Shang in Fengmen. More than thirty pieces of tomb boundary stone in the excavated area were all excavated. Only one piece remains. It is said that this Nanmu coffin has been around for many years, perhaps dating back to the Song Dynasty. It is difficult to determine because the main tomb has not been found. Moreover, the excavation is not only in this one place in Nan Yuan Shang, but also in the wasteland near the Public Sports Ground and Yanzi Temple. Hundreds of corpses have been excavated, and the bones are exposed, which is very tragic. After the association received the report, on the afternoon of the 20th, the committee members Zhang Zhongren and Li Yinquan, accompanied by County Chief Huang, brought a photographer from Liucun Photography Studio to inspect Nan Yuan Shang first. Unexpectedly, the four lacquered ancient Nanmu coffins had been stolen. According to the residents of the area, the excavators were all from Jiangbei, hired by people from Shanghai. The photographer was immediately ordered to photograph the excavated area and the police from the Second Branch were ordered to guard it and investigate the excavators and thieves. They then went to the back of the Public Sports Ground to investigate. It was learned that Wang Jintai and Pan Rixuan, who grew vegetables there, were suspected of being involved in the case. The First Branch summoned them to the bureau for questioning. According to their confession, they did not know about the private excavation of the cemetery. They were transferred by the bureau to the Public Security Bureau and then to the county for questioning and detention.</p>

<p>A Water Police officer negligently kills someone. Zhang, a barber in Yangshuyuan Town, Yuanhe District, has a son who is married to a woman surnamed Mou, who is in her thirties. On the afternoon of the 18th, Lin Desheng, a soldier from the Second Squad of the Thirteenth Detachment of the Water Police stationed there, went to Zhang's barbershop for a haircut. The soldier was wearing his uniform and a Mauser pistol on his belt. When he was getting a haircut, he took off the gun and belt. After the haircut, Lin put the gun back on his belt. Zhang then jokingly said, "What's this thing for?" Lin Desheng replied, "This is a Mauser pistol, it can kill people. Do you want to try it? I'll kill you." As he spoke and laughed, he held the Mauser pistol in his hand and pretended to aim, and pulled the trigger. Unexpectedly, the Mauser pistol was loaded with live ammunition and was not on safe, so the bullet fired when the trigger was pulled. Zhang was standing next to Lin, but luckily was not hit. However, his daughter-in-law was working behind him, and the bullet hit her lower abdomen on the left side, and she immediately fell to the ground unconscious. The whole family panicked and immediately grabbed Lin Desheng. At the same time, someone was sent to report to the district office, the Twelfth Sub-Bureau, and the Water Police Department. Inspector Guo Guoyu and Inspector Wang Yunying of the Public Security Sub-Bureau arrived at the scene one after another. The injured woman was taken to the Jishan Hospital in the city by water patrol boat for treatment. Meanwhile, the murderer Lin Desheng was taken back to the headquarters.

<p>A sudden storm arises in the Jiang silk industry. Jiang silk was the most famous product of this port during the Qing Dynasty. After the revolution, it declined sharply and has not been able to recover to this day. However, there are still five to six thousand workers who depend on it for a living. They are divided into two types: those who work on “che” (carriage) machines, numbering about 4,000 workers in 200 households, and those who work on “ji” (loom) machines, numbering about 1,500 workers in 300 households. The "che" industry (meaning the warp industry) used to produce four colors during the Qingming season for flowers and fruits: antique bronze, golden yellow, and blackish-yellow. They would send 78 taels of goods (silk) to the loom industry to be woven into 100 taels of silk. Since the introduction of foreign dyes, the representatives of the dyeing industry and the warp industry agreed that 75 taels should be considered as 100 taels. Last year, the warp and loom industries each elected ten representatives to sign an agreement to be observed. Now, unscrupulous elements in the loom industry are causing trouble, and the already agreed agreement has been broken. They are now acting independently, causing disputes between the two industries from time to time. Until the other day, the warp industry stopped work en masse due to cost concerns, as a passive resistance. Although there were people mediating, neither side had a real representative, making it difficult to negotiate. However, the loom industry is linked to the warp industry. When the warp industry stops, the loom industry has no silk to weave, and will soon stop as well. Although those who are not currently stopped have stock to weave, they will soon stop as well. If this dispute continues, the livelihood of thousands of workers will be severely affected. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this and quickly mediate to avoid any complications.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Police School is temporarily difficult to relocate. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Police School, due to the fact that the Guard Division intends to be stationed in Zhenjiang, the Ministry of Military Affairs intends to take back the barracks used by the school. The school had surveyed an address in Nantong in preparation for relocation. It is now heard that the school originally intended to relocate to Nantong immediately, but due to the emptiness of the provincial treasury, repairs and relocation would cost at least 20,000 yuan. Furthermore, the school will hold its graduation ceremony within the next forty to fifty days. If the relocation is carried out, there would be many inconveniences, so the talk of relocation is difficult to realize for the time being.</p>

<p>Local villagers at Tianmu Temple obstruct road construction. When construction started on the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Gua Yu Road Yang You Section, which belongs to sections one through five (place name Tianmu Temple) of Jiangdu’s Seventh District, on the 15th, hundreds of local villagers suddenly arrived to obstruct the road construction. They demanded that the fields, houses, and graves in the area not be touched, only then would they allow the road construction. The Director of the Yu Construction Bureau separately telegraphed the Pacification Superintendent’s Office, the Construction Department, and the County Government, requesting them to send teams for assistance. He also went to the province to meet Director Sun to ask for instructions. The department ordered the county to send a team to protect the construction and punish the ringleaders. On the previous day, Director Yu, together with the police team of the Public Security Bureau, led the team to Shao to supervise and urge the continuation of the work. However, as soon as they arrived at the construction site, hundreds of female villagers had gathered there, each holding farm tools and dirty objects, and continued to petition to obstruct the road construction. Although the Director and others tried their best to persuade them, they could not stop them. They were also aggressively trying to attack Director Yu. With the protection of the road guards, he was able to escape. Seeing that Yu had left, the villagers went to the Chamber of Commerce and the District Office to petition, with the same goal as before. Some of the villagers, due to hunger, took food from the cake shops at will. Seeing this situation, the shops went to the camp headquarters to report and requested that a team be sent to maintain order together with the road police. The villagers misunderstood the soldiers as the Bao An Tuan (security corps) and a conflict arose. The camp headquarters took ten female villagers away. Seeing that the military police were arresting people, some villagers rushed into the camp headquarters. Only after extreme restraint were they dispersed.</p>

<p>Starting this summer, the Ministry of Education has ordered all schools at all levels to uniformly wear uniforms, notifying the education bureaus of all provinces and cities. The Training Directorate-General's letter states that the student uniforms were previously stipulated and circulated for implementation by your ministry. Recently, the military instructors of various schools have reported to this department that while many schools can earnestly comply with the regulations, some schools do not pay attention to this matter. The school feels that the spirit is not invigorated, and the military training also feels that there are many obstacles. It is proposed to transfer the consultation to strictly order the implementation of various schools to facilitate education. At present, it is necessary to rectify the school spirit and cultivate the habit of discipline, integrity and simplicity. Therefore, clothing should not be allowed to take all kinds of forms to express the spirit of distraction and the atmosphere of depravity and extravagance. However, the matter involves expenses, and it is difficult to avoid stagnation if simultaneous planning and care are not taken. Accordingly, please consult with your department to separately specify the number of sets of clothing that each student at each level of school should make each academic year, and the approximate amount of clothing fees that should be charged for strict implementation to show uniformity and ease of compliance. The student uniform regulations of this department were formulated and promulgated in April of the 18th year, and were notified in June of the same year that students at all levels of schools should uniformly wear uniforms from the 18th year. Now that the schools have not uniformly followed the regulations, they should be notified immediately to strive for uniformity. This is limited to the summer of this year. Except that primary schools can make appropriate changes in accordance with Article 9 of the student uniform regulations, other schools at all levels should strictly comply and must not delay. In addition, the student uniform regulations stipulate that uniforms are divided into winter and summer styles, and the materials must be completely domestic products. Schools at all levels must comply with this order, in addition to separate lines, and instruct all schools under their jurisdiction to comply with this order.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the work report submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau from July to December of the 19th year, the Ministry of Education instructed that all the items in the report are fully understood. Regarding the various tasks of school education, such as running summer schools, stipulating the methods for primary school teachers to suspend repairs, and holding small-scale problems experiments, all are important. The methods and processes of the small-scale problems experiments should be reported at any time so that they can be published in the bulletin of this department as experimental research materials for various places. However, there are several matters that need attention: (1) There are too many out-of-school children in Shanghai. Every time there is an entrance examination, the schools are full. Primary schools should add or increase levels as much as possible to remedy this. (2) Teachers should be given generous rewards for further education. Those who have won awards should be given job security and qualification promotion. Active encouragement has a more effective effect. (3) The anti-corruption measures for school finances should be examined in detail and implemented conscientiously in light of the actual situation. The bureau may entrust accountants to check the accounts to supplement the shortcomings of the open financial methods and ensure that every penny is for public use. The style of integrity clears the accumulated ills and attaches importance to public funds from the school. (4) The selection of principals for primary and secondary schools should pay close attention to both qualifications and experience. Those who are filling the ranks should be eliminated. Those who have no practical experience should also be carefully examined to prevent those who are lucky enough to be admitted. (The following is omitted)</p>

<p>Result: 1-1 | Zhabei Fights with Group B Talent | Zhabei Conserves Strength and Prepares to Seize the Senior Cup Today. Yesterday's Lineup Against Portugal Consisted of Group B Players. Over Two Thousand Spectators at the Chinese Baseball Field Witnessed the Fierce Competition, Adding an Element of Interest. After a Ninety-Minute Battle, the Score Ended in a 1-1 Draw. Referee Bort.</p>
<p>New Recruits Show Strength: Zhabei's New Army Includes Tong Rongwen and Yang Baosen, Who Have Participated in Major Battles and Possess Exceptional Skills. The Rest Are Also Remarkable. The Saying "Strong Players Come from Prestigious Teams" Is Indeed True. In the First Half, They Were Cautious When Facing Strong Opponents, Appearing Restrained. After Forty-Five Minutes, They Suddenly Improved, Constantly Threatening the Portuguese Team. Driven by Sincerity, They Capitalized on a Corner Kick and Scored. Fortunately, the Portuguese Team Was Awarded Two Penalty Kicks, But Goalkeeper Jiang Jinzong's Excellent Skills Saved One, Resulting in the Final Score of 1-1.</p>
<p>Renowned Players Unable to Display Skills: The Portuguese Team's Strength Was Not Complete. The So-Called Renowned Players Were Only Marcel and Favan, One Inside and One Outside, Who Had Earned Achievements. Initially, They Underestimated Zhabei's Ordinary Players, But After Several Unsuccessful Attacks, They Used Full Strength. However, Not Only Were They at a Disadvantage, but They Also Conceded a Goal. They Then Called on Marcel to Join the Front Line for a Final Effort, But Zhabei Closely Guarded Key Positions, Watching the Opponents Like Shadows, Not Letting Them Get an Inch Away.</p>
<p>Even with High Skills and Strength, They Had No Room to Maneuver. If There Had Been No Penalty Kicks, They Would Have Suffered the Humiliation of Losing.</p>
<p>The Changing Situation Ended in a Draw: As the Whistle Blew, the Portuguese Team's Attacks Were Frequent. Zhabei Defended Well and Was Not Harmed. Opportunities to Invade Were Difficult to Capitalize On. Much Precious Time Was Wasted on Both Sides Due to Numerous Errors, Resulting in Many Laughs. That Was the Score in the First Half. At the Start of the Second Half, Zhabei Showed Great Improvement, Overpowering the Portuguese Team. At the Beginning, They Faced a Sudden Danger, Almost Conceded a Goal by Veto. Tong Rongwen Also Encountered a Good Opportunity, But Missed It Due to Improper Handling. In the 25th Minute, the Portuguese Team Was Awarded a Penalty Kick. T. Kongshun Husband Kicked, But the Goalkeeper Lightly Caught It, Turning Danger into Safety. The Audience Praised Loudly. The Front Line's Sharpness Suddenly Increased, Forcing a Corner Kick. Lin Chaoyuan's Pass Was Perfect, and Tong Rongwen Scored a Goal, Opening the Score. They Smiled and Celebrated. Not Long After, the Portuguese Front Line Gained Increased Strength with Marcel's Help and Was Awarded Another Penalty Kick. Marcel's Skillful Kick Broke Through the Net, Making It 1-1. Afterwards, Zhabei's Goal Faced Many Threats. Goalkeeper Jiang Zongjin Showed Great Skill, Repeatedly Seizing the Ball from the Enemy's Iron Cavalry, Protecting the Goal. His Contribution Was Great. The Result Was a 1-1 Draw.</p>
<p>Zhabei Team: Zhong Qingfa, Cai Rongrui, Zeng Rongzhong, Jiang Jinzong, Chen Fuzhong, Yun Fenglin, Chen Chunxiu, Liu Shengfang, Tong Rongwen, Yang Baosen, Lin Chaoyuan.</p>
<p>Portugal Team: 0. Kongshun Husband, Xueerfo, Su, Shishan Na, Ma, Saike, Falila, Falila, Favofu, Kaositan, Aiqiu'er.</p>

<p>Santitude Hall Informs China Merchants Bureau That It Will Not Sell | China Merchants Bureau Informs The French Consul General To Seek Justice</p>
<p>In the Jin Li Yuan Wharf Case, China Merchants Bureau Arbitrator Gao Shuo Wrote to the French Consul General Gantelin Yesterday, Saying:</p>
<p>"Dear Sir, My Lawyer Is Handling The Jin Li Yuan Wharf Arbitration Case. I Am Grateful To Your Consul General For Considering The Diplomatic Relations Between The Two Countries And Repeatedly Mediating. My Lawyer Negotiated Back And Forth With Father Xiaqi Of Santitude Hall. On November 3 Last Year, They Formally Sent A Letter Acknowledging That They Were Willing To Sell The Land To The China Merchants Bureau, But The Asking Price Was Too High, And I Asked Them To Make Concessions, Which Was Delayed And Unresolved. On The Thirteenth Of This Month, My Lawyer, On Behalf Of My Company, Held His Business Card And, Together With The French Municipal Council Member Mr. Zhang Jixian, Visited To Discuss The Sale Price. The Father Groundlessly Accused The China Merchants Bureau Of Being Thieves And Robbers. Fearing That My Lawyer Would Not Understand, He Repeated The Above In Shanghai Dialect, Openly Insulting Him, Which Was Beyond Reason. It Is Permissible Under The Laws Of All Countries To Bargain. Although The Father Represents The Church, I Am Afraid That Your Country Has No Church That Can Force Others To Obey The Selling Price. This Attitude Resembles The Ancient Roman Pope. My Lawyer Followed Your Consul General's Guiding Principle Of Settling Matters Peacefully, Endured It On The Spot And Did Not Clash Immediately, And Still Sent A Letter To Continue Negotiating In The Hope Of Settling The Case. Yesterday, Lawyer Baho Sent A Letter On Behalf Of The Church, Which Stated: 'We Now Have A Letter From Santitude Hall To Your Lawyer On The Seventeenth Of This Month To Father Xiaqi, The Manager Of The Church, Entrusting This Lawyer To Reply On His Behalf, As Follows: According To Your Letter, The China Merchants Bureau Is Willing To Purchase All Wharf And Shengke Ownership Of The Jin Li Yuan Wharf Registered Under A No. 69 For 200,000 Shanghai Universal Silver Dollars, Including In It. The Price Differs By As Much As 190,000 Silver Dollars From The 390,000 Taels Requested By My Client On November 3, 1930. My Client Believes That The Matter Is Difficult To Approach And There Is No Need To Continue Negotiations. Please Formally Inform The China Merchants Bureau That The Asking Price Of 390,000 Taels For Selling The Property Registered Under A No. 69 To The China Merchants Bureau On November 3, 1930, Has Now Been Unconditionally Withdrawn, Etc.' This Is A Fundamental Overturn. It Seems That The Father Has No Sincerity In Handling Matters, His Actions Are Almost Childish, And He Disregards The Diplomatic Relations Between China And France, Ignoring The Hard Work Of The Consul General And The Various Authorities In Mediating. The China Merchants Bureau Already Has Various Plans And Preparations For The Land Because The Other Party Allowed The Sale, And It May Not Be Convenient To Allow The Withdrawal Lightly. This Concerns A Breakdown In Mediation. I Am Sending You A Special Letter And Hope That You Will Strongly Maintain The Public Interest. Respectfully Submitted To The French Consul General In Shanghai, China Merchants Bureau Arbitrator Lawyer Gao Shuo."</p>

If we violate this oath, we are willing to accept the most severe sanctions from this association."</p>
<p>Closing Remarks Chairman Nie delivered the closing remarks, stating that the conference has received great attention from society, and hopes to continue efforts to improve cotton production. The yield of American upland cotton has declined due to cotton pests, with a yield of only 150 pounds per acre, which is very low. Meanwhile, world consumption is decreasing, and Russian cotton has good quality and increasing production. If China does not seek progress, the future is very dangerous. China has such a large land area, and if we can strive for progress, I firmly believe there is hope. I hope that everyone can work hard and not let our efforts be in vain. I am willing to encourage this with my colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Can the Ministry of Finance Clear Up Long-Standing Abuses After Abolishing the Likin? <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying that the Chamber's inspection department, in accordance with the Central Government's instructions, abolished the Likin, regular customs duties, and all taxes similar to the Likin on New Year's Day this year. This has been announced to the entire country and is widely known to the public. Local finance is of utmost importance. In addition to the central government approving the implementation of legitimate business taxes, the Ministry is also planning to allocate funds to compensate for the losses. It should be noted that the government's policy of rigorously abolishing the Likin aims to clear up long-standing abuses and benefit the people. We are sincerely concerned that ineffective implementation may lead to a resurgence of illegal organizations and old bureaucrats changing their names and attempting to try their luck. The Chamber of Commerce, as a collective organization of citizens across the province, must have a more accurate understanding of the situation. Now that more than two months have passed since the abolition, we hope that you can provide detailed and factual information on whether the implementation in various parts of the province has been thoroughly cleared up, and whether there are any other abuses, so that we can investigate and verify. Your prompt response is greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Hanyi Flights to be Held Within Days <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Three Flights Per Week: China National Aviation Corporation Expands its Business by Adding Hanyi Route. It has been reported that Shashi and Yichang are important commercial hubs in Hubei Province. The implementation of Hanyi flights will greatly facilitate transportation. According to the company's manager, who spoke to a reporter from Guowen News Agency yesterday, the decision to implement Hanyi flights has been made, starting from the 23rd of this month. The pontoon at the riverside in Shashi has also been installed. Initially, mail will be carried, with flights between Hanyi on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Stinson aircraft will be used, with four planes dedicated to the Hanyi route. There are four Chinese and foreign pilots with extensive experience. The flight schedule for Hanyi has now been set and has been sent to the Wuhan office for compliance. The current schedule is as follows: departure from Hankou at 8:15 AM, arrival in Shashi at 9:45 AM, arrival in Yichang at 11:40 AM, departure from Yichang at 12:00 PM, arrival in Shashi at 12:45 PM, and arrival in Hankou at 2:25 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Inspection of Foreign Passports to be Extended <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Said to be Extended to May 1st. The matter of inspecting the passports of foreigners entering China has been decided by Chief Chen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who has decided to rent a building in Wusong to establish a foreign affairs sub-section and has transferred Chen Timing to be the deputy director of the foreign affairs section. Chen Timing will lead the inspectors to Wusong to start operations immediately. It was originally scheduled to be established on the 25th of this month, and starting from April 1st, all foreign ships entering the port would be inspected according to regulations. A request has been submitted to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the embassies and consulates of various countries in China. It is now learned that the consulates of various countries in this port do not object to the Municipal Public Security Bureau's implementation of passport inspections for foreigners entering the country. However, it seems too hasty to implement the inspections starting from April 1st. The postal ships and world-class ships of various countries have already been opened before receiving the notification, and many passengers may not have prepared their passports. If the inspections are implemented for these ships, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-April, it will cause many obstacles. It would be best to implement the inspections at the beginning of May, so that all ships have received the notification, and foreigners coming to China will have completed their passport procedures. Chief Chen realized that the information provided by the consulates was accurate. To avoid conflicts, he decided to extend the implementation period. He instructed the inspectors to actively practice. It is now heard that Chief Chen intends to extend the establishment of the foreign affairs sub-section to April 15th and implement the inspections starting from May 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Qin Runqing Talks About the Need for Qianzhuang Law <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Qianzhuang are mainly based on credit lending, fundamentally different from banks. A reporter from New Voice News Agency specifically visited Qin Runqing, a standing committee member of the Qianye Gonghui, yesterday to inquire about his views on the Qianye Gonghui's request to the National Government for the enactment of a separate Qianzhuang Law. Qin's reply was quite important, and the main points are as follows: Although both the banking and qianzhuang industries are financial institutions, they are fundamentally different. Qianzhuang lending is based on the borrower's credit, which has always been the case. After the opening of trade, although Shanghai also imitated the foreign financial industry's practice of using collateral for lending, it was still a minority. As for the interior, the old morality of thousands of years and the old habits of hundreds of years are based on credit lending. For example, when tea is launched in the first half of the year and flowers and rice are launched in the second half of the year, the loans granted to merchants are all credit loans. Therefore, farmers and merchants have been accustomed to this practice for thousands of years, and it is indispensable. Secondly, small and medium-sized stores with capital of only 10,000 or 20,000 yuan, or several thousand yuan, often have a business volume that exceeds their capital by several times, which also relies on the credit loans of qianzhuang for assistance. Moreover, China does not have large merchants to support small and medium-sized merchants, so preventing the monopoly of large merchants is of direct benefit to farmers and workers, and is in line with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's policy of regulating capital and supporting farmers and workers. Therefore, restricting credit lending to qianzhuang will not only hinder qianzhuang but also have a great impact on society. The organization of qianzhuang is a partnership, and the shareholders bear unlimited liability. There are also very strict industry regulations to protect the credit of the industry. If qianzhuang are subordinate to the Banking Law, in addition to the stagnation of funds, the suspicion of investors, and the difficulty of reorganizing the company, there are other difficulties. The assets of the shareholders are mostly cash, which is deposited in A today and deposited in B tomorrow, or used for other businesses, and there is no certainty. If it is disclosed to the outside world, it will be shunned by the business community. Therefore, it is practically impossible to report the property certificate. As for the amount of capital, it should be determined according to the local commercial situation. If it is limited to a fixed number, it may not be possible to collect a large amount of funds in rural towns. When the country is currently unable to establish agricultural and industrial banks throughout the country, if the original qianzhuang are restricted by regulations and unable to maintain their current status, the funds of rural towns, farmers, and workers will inevitably not be able to be circulated. Other issues, such as business hours, are too rigid, and business procedures are more cumbersome, are minor issues. In short, national laws and regulations should be popularized in rural towns and remote areas, and should not only be applied to large cities.</p>

<p>Locomotive derailed, trunk line blocked. At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, a locomotive C49 derailed on a branch line for unloading mud at the Hepingmen Station on the Jinghu Railway while shunting cars to the main line. This blocked the trunk line until around 3:00 PM when the engineering department repaired it and the trains were able to pass. As a result, the express train that should have arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 9:25 PM last night was delayed by more than four hours, and the trains from Shanghai to Beijing were also delayed due to the blocked line.</p>

<p>Regaining Water Rights During the troubled times of the sixth year of the Republic of China, the British firm Jardine Matheson installed a pontoon in Lianhua Zhou, Zhenjiang, infringing on the water rights owned by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. At that time, the British Zhenjiang Customs Commissioner sided with the firm, so despite repeated negotiations, the water rights of Lianhua Zhou have not been recovered, and the firm has not been ordered to remove the pontoon. The Bureau will relocate the old pontoon from Anqing to that location and instruct the shipping department to implement it.</p>

<p>A body floated up in the river in Puzhong yesterday, hands tied with hemp rope to the neck, seemingly strangled and thrown into the river. A male corpse floated in the Puzhong River at the wharf of the Mitsui Flour Mill on Liping Road, Yangshupu. It was a case of homicide. The deceased was about thirty years old, wearing a yellow coat, blue cloth trousers, twill flannel lining, and yellow silk socks. His hands were tied behind his back with hemp rope, which was also wrapped around his neck several times, with the knot also on his neck. After learning about the incident, the Weituoma Wharf Water Patrol Station immediately dispatched Detective Wang Haiquan to take the corpse to the Nanshi Wharf Rescue Bureau. Wang Haiquan reported the case to the local court. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhao and Coroner Shen arrived at the scene for an examination, confirming that the deceased had been strangled to death. They ordered the body to be collected for further investigation to apprehend the murderer. It is suspected that the deceased was a dock worker who was strangled to death and thrown into the river in a cruel "lotus planting" style. The patrol station has dispatched Detective Wang to investigate the identity of the deceased and apprehend the murderer.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The Nun Qing Shan's Eloquent Defense in the Case of Illegally Excavating the Coffin of the Seventh-Generation Ancestor <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Converting Private Property to Repay the Monastery's Public Debt; Coffins of Fellow Monks, Not Ancestral Tombs. Gen Lin, the abbess of the Guanyin Hall on Lujia, Changbin Road, Public Concession, previously filed a lawsuit through her lawyer, Yan Lv, accusing her disciple, Qing Shan, of stealing and selling the tomb of her seventh-generation ancestral teacher and abandoning seven coffins. The case has been repeatedly investigated by the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, but has been delayed until now without a verdict because Qing Shan has not yet appeared in court. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Qing Shan returned to Shanghai from Putuo yesterday. After learning that she had been accused by her teacher, Gen Lin, she hired a lawyer to file a counterclaim and voluntarily surrendered to the court, requesting that the court summon witnesses for cross-examination. The main points of the reasons presented by the nun Qing Shan are as follows:</p>
<p>Selling Land to Repay Debts The nun Qing Shan is currently forty-four years old and is from Zhejiang. In the second year of the Republic of China, she entered the monastery and became a disciple of Gen Lin. In the fourth year, she was promoted to be the manager of the monastery, and has been in charge for seventeen years. She has repaired many temples and Buddhist statues, accumulating debts totaling 2,000 gold. Until last year, due to the pressure of creditors, she had no choice but to sell her private property cemetery (two acres and six fen of cemetery land in the 28th district and 6th ward of the Fahua District) to pay off the debts.</p>
<p>The Tomb is Private The monastery submitted a request to the National Government for temple registration on May 20, 1929. At that time, the manager of the monastery, Nun Qing Shan, submitted her name and attached a photo of Qing Shan. The cemetery in the Fahua District is private property and has not been registered. Therefore, the nun believes that she has the right to sell the land and use the proceeds to repay the debts owed by the monastery for repairing temples and Buddhist statues over the years. All evidence will be presented in court during the trial.</p>
<p>Relocation to Public Cemetery Regarding the alleged excavation of the tombs of the seventh-generation ancestral teacher, the tombs are not the tombs of the ancestral teacher. The seven coffins buried in the tombs are all of fellow monks. They have now been relocated to the Yongnian Public Cemetery. The cost of cremation and burial is 100 taels of silver per coffin, plus transportation costs, totaling 800 taels of silver. It can be said that the remains have been abandoned.</p>
<p>Rong Xiang Becomes an Enemy There are five nuns in the monastery, including Rong Xiang, who is young and does not abide by the monastic rules, resulting in her being pregnant. She went to Hangzhou in June last year to give birth to a daughter. At that time, Qing Shan advised her not to listen, but instead became an enemy, resulting in this lawsuit. Qing Shan has now presented two letters from her master (describing the situation in the hospital) sent by the nun Rong Xiang last year from the Guanyin Nunnery on Jie Dai Temple Port, Hushu, Hangzhou, as strong evidence.</p>
<p>Preparing to File a Counterclaim Qing Shan has now collected evidence of the privately owned cemetery in the Fahua District and is preparing to summon witnesses for cross-examination in court to find out the truth. All counterclaim sections are now being drafted by a lawyer for submission.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Continued Trial of Bandits for Kidnapping and Extortion <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the kidnapping of Li Huiqing, there are also three cases of extortion. On February 8th of this year, at 1:40 AM, Hui Yunfang, the Ningbo manager of the Xielong Real Estate Company, a Sino-Japanese joint venture located at 313 Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, was about to be kidnapped by bandits, but they mistakenly kidnapped Hui's friend, Li Huiqing. Li was later released for a ransom of 2,000 yuan. However, after this incident, Hui repeatedly received threatening letters from the bandits, attempting to extort tens of thousands of silver dollars. Hui's representative, Zeng Yisheng, reported the case to the Lao Zha Public Concession Police. Chinese Detective You Agen, detectives Song Bingzheng, Liu Junqing, Liu Chunshu, and others arrested Zhou Linsheng from Pudong, Lu Agen from Yangzhou, and Zhou's mistress, Xu Yuying, and Lu's mistress, Wang Genmei, at the Huizhong Hotel and other places. They were handed over to the Special District Local Court for questioning and investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Criminal Tribunal Chief Xu Jiashi opened the court to continue the trial. The female defendant Wang Genmei was not brought to court because she was in labor. According to the police lawyer, the defendants are accused of kidnapping Li Huiqing, and Zhou Linsheng and Lu Agen are also accused of writing threatening letters in three cases. The defendants are ordered to present their case first.</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Kidnapping of Li Huiqing Li's friend Hui Yunfang has a car with license plate number 8743. Hui goes to a certain room in the East Asia Hotel every night for entertainment. On the night of the kidnapping, Hui happened to have something to do and was not in his car, so he lent it to Li Huiqing. Li, along with his friend Chou Bingrong and Chou's son Chou Bingheng, rode in the car. When they drove to Nanjing Road near Guangxi Road, several bandits suddenly rushed out and asked if Hui Yunfang was in the car. Li and others replied that Hui was not in the car. The bandits then questioned each person's name and recognized that Li Huiqing was qualified to be kidnapped. They drove Chou and his son off the car, and Chou Bingrong's leather coat was also stripped off. Then, they took Li to Lu Agen's house on the overpass at 15 Ershi East Road, French Concession, and locked Li's hands and feet with iron chains. Later, Li's wife contacted the bandits. The bandits sent Xu Yuying as a representative to negotiate. As a result, Li was released for a ransom of 2,000 yuan. After Li escaped, he went to the police station to report the incident. Therefore, the defendants Lu Agen and Xu Yuying are actually the main offenders. However, when Wang Genmei was arrested, a pawn ticket was found on her person. The detective traced the pawn ticket to Wanjic Pawnshop on Aivenyi Road and retrieved the leather coat stripped from Chou Bingrong. The detective took it to Chou's house for him to identify whether it was the original stolen item. Chou suddenly denied that the leather coat had been stripped off. However, he did report to the police station at the time that a leather coat had been robbed. The plaintiff and witnesses in the kidnapping case have not arrived in court today. The court should issue a warrant to summon them. Since the last adjournment, the police have ordered detectives to arrest the gang leader Fang at 179 Nancheng Dulu. However, he had already fled upon hearing the news. Only two pieces of paper were seized, which recorded the distribution of the loot. Lu Agen and others each received one share, while Xu Yuying received one and a half shares. According to the police investigation, the funds used before the kidnapping were all advanced by Xu Yuying, so she received half a share more than others. An iron chain and two pairs of sunglasses were also seized from Lu Agen's house at 15 Ganshijie Road, French Concession. However, the defendant Zhou Linsheng was not at the scene when the kidnapping took place, and only committed the crime of writing threatening letters. Therefore, the police did not prosecute Zhou for the kidnapping case. As for the charges of extortion and fraud committed by these people, there are (1) a threatening letter written to Yuanfengshun Candle Shop at 893 Zhejiang Road on January 1st of this year, attempting to defraud several thousand silver dollars, (2) a similar method used to threaten Mo Jingshan, the owner of Taifeng Pawnshop at 514 Kaifeng Road, on February 2nd of this year, attempting to extort a large sum of money because they failed to kidnap Mo, and then wrote threatening letters, and (3) an extortion case against Sanyang South Goods Store at 528 Nanjing Road in 1918. All witnesses have been summoned to court for questioning. Then, the threatening letters were presented to the court as evidence. According to the complaint of Zeng Yisheng, the representative of the plaintiff Hui Yunfang, Hui has gone to Ningbo and cannot be present today. Questioned the defendant Lu Agen, who confessed that the remaining room was rented by Fang, and that he did not know about the kidnapping. The defendant Xu Yuying confessed that she was contacted by the fugitive Fang and Agen to contact Li Huiqing, but she did not know what it was about. Later, she went to Li's house in Zhilanfang, Baxianqiao, and obtained 2,000 silver dollars. Fang gave me 150 yuan, but I actually received 40 yuan, and the remaining silver was borrowed by Fang. Zhou Linsheng has been having an affair with her since last year, etc. The victims who received the threatening letters testified to the court about the circumstances of the case. Lu Agen hired lawyer E Sen to defend him. Judge Xu verified the confession and ordered the defendants to be detained separately pending a rescheduled trial, as the case still needs to be investigated.</p>

<h3 id="e119">New Building of the Young Women's Christian Association to be Completed Soon <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Meeting Scheduled to Discuss Association Affairs. The national association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China has been building a new association building on Yuanmingyuan Road. The seven-story building has been completed, and it is expected that all of the eighth-story main building and the rooftop attic will be completed by Easter. The association is located behind the British Consulate, and the view of the Huangpu River can be seen from the second floor and above, which is an excellent location. The land was purchased in 1919 by the National Young Women's Christian Association of America and transferred to the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China for safekeeping in 1927. Initially, there were three old houses. It was decided to rebuild the building at the annual meeting in 1929, and Madam Mei Huaquan was appointed as the chairman of the construction committee. The plan was drawn and donations were raised. So far, 70% of the construction funds have been raised. The remaining funds will be borrowed from various banks. After completion, it is planned to lease the floors below the seventh floor and use the interest to repay the loan. The eighth floor will be reserved for the association's offices and meeting places. The association is scheduled to hold a joint meeting of all committee members and directors in the new association building on the sixth floor this Wednesday to report on the progress of the new association building and discuss the association's affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Horse Riding School Offers Special Treatment to Chinese <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Yiding Pan Da West Horse Riding School has been established for more than ten years. Its facilities are complete, and it has a total of more than 200 horses. Dozens of people go to learn riding skills every day, and hundreds of people have graduated. All of them are well-known figures in the Chinese and Western business and political circles. According to the school's regulations, one course consists of 35 lessons and is completed in five weeks. The teaching method is different every week, so after completing one course, students can become proficient in various riding techniques. It is said that in recent years, more Westerners have learned to ride horses. Chinese people often feel that the fees are too high, or think that horse riding is prone to danger, or think that there are no suitable places. In fact, the horses in ordinary stables have not been trained and are wild and difficult to tame, which can easily lead to falls. The horses in this school have been trained for a long time and can be commanded freely, so there is absolutely no other danger. In terms of expenses, in order to give special treatment to Chinese people, special group study classes are now offered, and the tuition fees are specially reduced, so that our young students have the opportunity to learn to ride horses. School students are especially welcome. They can learn from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM. The methods are: (1) For groups or students with more than 10 people, the tuition fee will be reduced by one-half of the original price. For more than 100 people, only one-fifth will be charged. Both men and women are welcome, and each school is specially allowed one free teacher. (2) For places that are too far away, such as Jiangwan and Yangshupu, the school can send coaches to lead the horses to nearby open spaces for training. Riding skills are the best method of whole-body exercise and are not limited to men, women, old, and young. Recently, the school entrusted Xie Hong of Shenbao to contact people from all walks of life.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Private Collection of Other People's Letters <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Fined 100 Yuan. A Western woman, Bei Danggu, residing at No. 309 Maierxi Road, French Concession, previously hired a lawyer to represent her in the French Court, accusing her cohabitant, the Western woman Fan Boen, of privately collecting the plaintiff's letters. She requested that the letters be handed over, and requested a trial and compensation for losses. The defendant also denied privately collecting letters through her lawyer. After hearing the arguments and testimony, the case was closed and submitted for review and judgment. Yesterday, the Chinese and Western officials of the Ming Tang Court summoned both parties and ruled that the defendant's private collection of other people's letters had been proven. The defendant should be fined 100 yuan, which will be confiscated. The plaintiff's request for a private prosecution is reserved and may be filed separately in the Civil Court.</p>

<p>Luckily Encountered Mr. Du Who Provided Assistance. Yesterday morning at 0:45 AM, a young man hired sampan number 1067 at the Jiujiang Road wharf, claiming he would pay two dimes to cross to Pudong. Unexpectedly, when the boat reached the center of the river, the young man suddenly jumped into the water, intending to commit suicide. Although it was dark, the boatman quickly rescued him before he drowned completely. He was then sent to the water police station. According to his statement, his name is Wu Yutian, also known as Bao Lin, 19 years old, from Shengze County, Jiangsu Province. He used to work at the sales department of the 別發 bookstore on Nanjing Road in the Public Concession. Later, he had disagreements with his colleagues and left his job in anger. His parents in his hometown had also passed away one after another. Coupled with being unemployed for a long time and being lonely, he felt that the circumstances were so dire, unlike anything he had encountered since birth. Therefore, he became tired of the world and wanted to commit suicide, and so on. The young man was good at English and conversed fluently with the Western officers in the police station. The head of the police ordered Chinese detective Ge Changsheng to send him to the residence of Mr. Du Yuesheng, a prominent figure in the French Concession, to find ways to help him. Mr. Du, considering Wu's situation to be truly pitiful, not only provided financial assistance on the spot but also introduced him to a job at the Race Club, so that he could live in peace, it is said.</p>

Last November, Mrs. Wah fell ill in New York and was treated by doctors, who announced her recovery. Unexpectedly, she passed away on February 16th. Her friends in China were deeply saddened upon hearing the news, it is said.</p>

<p>Chen Asi Admits to Consensual Adultery. Chen Qianlin Denies Abduction. A woman from Gaoyou, Yu Zhu, took her children, Guangren and Hongzi, to live at 518 East Youheng Road. Chen Asi and Chen Changlin from Yangzhou also lived in the house. Taking advantage of Hongzi's youth, Chen Asi lured her to Gujiazhai in Pudong yesterday morning and hid her there. After Ms. Yu reported the incident, the Harbin Police Department, in cooperation with the Public Security Bureau, arrested the Chen brothers and rescued Hongzi. Yesterday, they were brought to the Special District Court, where Judge Xiao interrogated them. Police lawyer Zhang Dayin stated that Chen Asi was charged with rape of an underage girl and abduction, while Chen Changlin was only charged with abduction. Yu Zhu stated that her daughter Hongzi was not yet sixteen years old and was already engaged. She had a secret affair with Chen Asi last autumn without her knowledge. This time, she was abducted and took thirteen pieces of clothing. In addition to the ones that were recovered, the rest were pawned and should be pursued. Hongzi then described the details of her adultery with Asi, saying that the first time was last September in the attic upstairs, and the second time was downstairs, both at night, without her mother's knowledge. The day before, she was lured with sweet words and stole thirteen pieces of her mother's and sister-in-law's clothing, packed them into a bundle, and fled to Pudong with Chen and others. Later, when their funds ran out, they pawned several items for three yuan. Chen Asi admitted to consensual adultery with Hongzi. Chen Changlin denied helping with the adultery.

<h3 id="e129">Flexible Measures for Cotton Fabric Unified Tax Waybill <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Unified Tax Department is dispatching personnel to be stationed permanently at the Cotton Fabric Association to handle matters. The Shanghai Cotton Fabric Association previously found the procedures for unified tax waybills to be inconvenient in various ways and dispatched representatives to the Ministry of Finance's Unified Tax Department to petition for changes and brought a formal presentation requesting approval. It is now reported that the Fifth Section of the Unified Tax Department sent a letter to the association yesterday, saying: "Regarding the various points presented in your letter of March 17th, we have informed the Director and discussed it with Director Wang. Regarding the matter of imitating the Customs Pass system, it is necessary to stipulate methods and printing, which may not be possible to handle in a short time. However, following the precedent of the Silk and Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association, the Suzhou Bureau may assign personnel to be stationed at the association to handle the procedures for exchanging waybills. It seems that this can be implemented immediately. However, the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Bureau wants to know the details. It is hoped that your association will nominate representatives to meet with Section Chief Chen of the Third Section of the Suzhou Bureau to obtain inquiries. As for the column for writing the destination of the tax certificate, it can be handled flexibly. Those who sell on the spot can fill in 'This Port.' Those who transport to various provinces can only fill in the two characters 'Other Ports' and pass through without obstruction." After receiving the letter, the Cotton Fabric Association immediately nominated four representatives, Chen, Li, Shi, and Ye, to meet with Section Chief Chen of the Third Section of the Suzhou Bureau. Section Chief Chen stated that the unified tax forms could be divided into several types in the future, such as one piece per sheet, five pieces per sheet, ten pieces per sheet, and so on, so that merchants could freely collect them according to their needs, which could save a lot of distribution procedures. However, because printing takes time, the bureau will first send two staff members to reside in the Cotton Fabric Association to handle distribution matters.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Labor-Management Negotiations in the Sanxin Yarn Factory Storm <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from Both Sides Have Been Appointed. Employees Hold a Meeting to Divide Responsibilities. The Sanxin Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road announced its sale, and the employees demanded a settlement of the aftermath, so the transfer has not yet been completed. The situation obtained yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation. After the labor-management negotiations failed the night before, the Yangshupu Police Department increased the number of armed police stationed at the factory for protection. Yesterday morning, many workers still came to the factory to inquire about the resumption of work. In order to maintain order, the police still sent detectives to patrol inside and outside the factory. By 4:00 PM, the male and female workers waiting outside the factory had retreated slightly, so some of the armed detectives also withdrew, leaving only a few stationed inside the factory.</p>
<p>Negotiations Underway. The employee relief group returned to the factory to convene a meeting after the negotiations failed last night due to a dispute over the number of representatives. In order to respect the opinions of the factory owner, they made concessions and reduced the number of representatives to four. They also sent a letter to the factory owner at 11:00 PM, ordering someone to send it to Sheng Ze cheng's residence on Jing'an Temple Road. Unexpectedly, the doorman refused to accept the letter on the grounds that the young master was already asleep. The original letter to the factory owner is recorded below: "Respectfully, yesterday, Dongweng (respected sir) instructed all the employees in the factory to elect representatives to negotiate with Dongweng at the company today (referring to yesterday, the 20th). All the employees in the factory elected six staff members and three foreman to await your arrival for a joint meeting. However, Dongweng suddenly insisted that the number of representatives should be limited to four. In order to express their sincerity in harmonious consultation, the colleagues immediately returned to the factory and appointed He [name], etc., as representatives because Dongweng had already left the company today and there was no opportunity to meet in person. They specially sent a letter to Dador to allow them to listen to the instructions tomorrow. Please indicate when it will be. This is respectfully requested for the inspection of Ze Gong, Ping Gong, and Sheng Gong Dongweng. Employee representatives Sun He [name], Chen Youqing, worker representatives Yang Yuheng, Hou Jiahai, jointly on March 20." It is heard that the factory owner and Rong Zongjing have appointed Zhu Cheng as their fully empowered representative, but he has not yet come to contact them.</p>
<p>Employees Express Their Views. According to employees, Sanxin has been in operation for forty years since its opening, and it has been profitable every year, with total profits reaching tens of millions. This sudden sale was unexpected. Therefore, the terms of dissolution proposed by the colleagues are not excessive. (1) A factory that has been profitable for many years should not be compared with other factories that are operating at a loss when it is sold. (2) What Rong [name] bought was only 70,000 spindles and 1,000 looms, while the most important real estate still fell into the hands of foreigners. At a time when our country's industry is declining, such a large industry should not be split apart. If Rong [name] can completely buy it, then the colleagues may not be able to make concessions. The small matter of dissolution fees is small, but the loss of our country's sovereignty is great. The order in the factory is quite good.</p>
<p>Employee Congress. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Employee Relief Group convened a congress. More than a hundred people, including all staff members and worker representatives, attended. Chen Youqing was publicly elected as chairman. It was resolved to (1) establish seven sections: General Affairs, Documentation, Accounting, Public Relations, General Services, Communications, and Discipline, in order to protect the safety of the factory and facilitate negotiations; (2) The General Affairs Section will have one section chief and seven section members, and the company may participate with one person. The Documentation Section will have one section chief and five section members. The Accounting Section will have one section chief and two section members. The Public Relations Section will have one section chief and four section members. The General Services Section will have one section chief and ten section members. The Communications Section will have one section chief and four section members. The Discipline Section will have twenty staff members and twenty workers, divided into groups to take turns on duty to protect the machinery in the factory and maintain order; (3) Elect five councilors to deliberate on all negotiation matters.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Record of Meeting of the Industrial and Commercial Management Association <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Wu Qingtai Speaks on His Impressions of Inspecting Industries in Europe. The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon at the Lianhua General Association on Beijing Road to invite Mr. Wu Qingtai, manager of the Shanghai Cement Company, to speak on his impressions of inspecting industries in Europe. Liu Hongsheng, Fu Bingwen, Shou Jingwei, Wu Yunshu, Chen Kuilai, and dozens of others, chaired by honorary director Cao Yunxiang, gathered for dinner. At the end of the dinner, the chairman stood up to deliver an introductory speech and report on the association's affairs as follows: (1) The association's advisors have been appointed and are ready to provide consultation to all parties and contribute to scientific management. (2) The Mechanical National Goods Factory Federation and the Commercial Press have organized a lecture series on scientific management issues, which has achieved excellent results and can be cooperated with by the association in the future. (3) At the second narrative meal of the association, it was resolved to organize a committee for the implementation of factory law. The chairman has appointed Li Zufan, Pan Gongzhan, Hu Shuhua, Ji Jiannan, and himself as committee members. The first committee meeting has been held and a presentation has been drafted to be printed and distributed to the national chambers of commerce for careful study before being submitted to the Legislative Yuan for revision and implementation of the difficulties. Next, Mr. Wu stood up to give a speech, and the main points are excerpted below: Qingtai was ordered by Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the factory, last September, and also entrusted by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, to attend the 14th International Labor Conference held in Geneva by the representative of the capital side. During his time abroad in September, he did not dare to say that he had obtained all the secrets, but he gained many impressions. The following are the impressions gained from the Labor Conference: The International Labor Conference originated from the League of Nations. All countries attach great importance to it. Although the resolutions passed must be implemented after being approved by their respective governments, whenever representatives from various countries meet, they argue endlessly. The reason for this is to stop the so-called labor policy of the Soviet government, and the representatives sent by various countries are all first-class figures. For example, the British representative is Ms. Bonfield, the Minister of Labor, and her accompanying staff, advisors, and experts all have Japanese representatives with lavish demeanor. Since the establishment of the National Government of China, it has participated twice, including this time. The seat of this qualification problem has been the most important, although no one has raised questions, but can only be used to fill the number. The cases discussed during the meeting were all European countries issues. The representatives of the Eastern Japanese countries, although occasionally speaking, were all beautiful words, of little importance. He attended the meeting for seventeen days, without interruption. This can be said to be innocent to the people. He will not elaborate on the details. Regarding the management problem, he went to various countries in Europe and the United States to investigate after the meeting closed. He now has the following impressions: All countries are now very simple in management methods, because all parties have realized it, so the effect on management is very macro. There are three points in our country's workers that make scientific management very difficult: (1) People's habits are too deep (2) People's education is not very average (3) People's perseverance is not enough So there are these three points China's industry is not developed and the management is not proper, which reduces productivity. I hope that you will find ways to deal with the above three points as soon as possible. After the speech, there was thunderous applause, and the meeting was dismissed at half past two.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Continued News of the Wreck of the Changjiang Steamer <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>It was reported in yesterday's newspaper that the Changjiang steamer, managed by Kang Zhenji, hit a reef in the North Yushan area and many people drowned. It is now known that the ship owner, Kela Xu Tuo, has arrived at the bank to report the details of the accident, saying that it was caused by heavy fog. The rescued crew members are still in the French Concession Police Station on Songshan Road. Yesterday, Kang Zhenji sent a telegram to Haiphong, Annam, to inquire about how the shipowner should handle the issue of compensation for the victims. Once a reply is received, they will be sent off. In addition, the huge sum of over 100,000 yuan that was lost in the ship could not be known in detail because the manifest had sunk in the ship. Therefore, a telegram was also sent to Haiphong and Hong Kong to send a copy of the manifest to Shanghai for verification of the number of goods and to notify the guests. A total of 3,600 tons of coal was lost with the ship. The Changjiang Steamer's hull is insured with Ping An Marine Insurance in Annam, so the shipowner will not suffer any losses. The continued news obtained yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Family Inquiries. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, the families of the Changjiang Steamer's crew members in Shanghai saw the reports in the newspapers about the ship's accident and the arrival of the victims in Shanghai. They rushed to the Songshan Road Police Station to inquire, supporting the old and carrying the young. Xu Arui's elderly mother from Zhoushan, Zhejiang, who was over fifty years old, heard that her son had drowned in the ocean and burst into tears, so painful that she wanted to die. Her tragic situation made onlookers feel sad. After being persuaded by others, she began to cry and return. The rest who saw their family members returning alive were overjoyed and rushed to buy food and clothing to send to them.</p>
<p>Request for Relief. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the shipwrecked crew members elected chief comprador Lin Fengshi as their representative to go to the Shanghai Steamer Company at 35 Renji Road to request relief. Manager Kang Zhenkui met with them and agreed to give each person a loss fee of 15 yuan. Lin thought the amount was too small and refused to accept it. He returned to report to the crew members.

<h3 id="e137">Petition for Aid from the Ba County Relief Committee <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Provisional Relief Committee of Ba County, Sichuan, wired as follows (abridged titles): "This year, misfortune continues to befall Sichuan. Last year, the rain was unseasonable, leading to spring floods and summer droughts. The harvest was poor, granaries are empty, the wealthy have become impoverished, and the poor are starving. Everywhere you look, the land is full of suffering. The news has spread far and wide, causing deep dismay. The vitality of the people has not yet recovered. Last winter, for a hundred days, there was no rain, and water sources dried up, causing the land to crack and split. The disaster is most severe in eastern Sichuan, which has always produced little rice and has a denser population than other areas. Ba County relies entirely on the assistance of the counties in upper Sichuan for its food supply. However, in this year of famine, everyone is struggling to take care of themselves, making it difficult to provide assistance. As a result, in recent months, there have been frequent prohibitions, cutting off supplies and causing rice prices to skyrocket. A single斗 of rice costs a hundred or a thousand, and there is not even any available to buy. Starving people cry out for food. The masses are wandering, creating unprecedented suffering. The people are the foundation of the nation, and food is the lifeblood of the people. The new harvest is still far off, and the vitality of the entire region is dwindling. If we reach the point where the old harvest is exhausted and the new harvest has not yet arrived, the suffering will be even greater. Thinking of the future, we cannot help but be alarmed. Therefore, on the 真 day of March, we gathered representatives from various agencies, France, and all sectors of society to establish the Provisional Relief Committee of Ba County in the county government. We also resolved to establish branch committees and offices in various districts, townships, and towns to urgently raise relief funds. However, the disaster is extremely severe and has reached a critical point. We hope that people from all walks of life will have compassion and empathy, and generously donate money and grain. Then, the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in Ba County will be eternally grateful. We are sending this urgent telegram with utmost sincerity and await your command."

<h3 id="e153">The National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association's Letter to the Five Yuan Presidents <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The National Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations Joint Federation sent a letter to the Five Yuan Presidents yesterday, saying: "President, we have read in the newspaper that the Chinese Medical and Pharmaceutical Association has sent a letter to you regarding the establishment of the National Medical Museum. We believe that this is not out of animosity towards traditional medicine or regret for the National Medical Museum. This shows that the association is being fair and reasonable, and is considering the matter calmly and rationally. They must have thought it over carefully and spoken thoughtfully. However, there are still some things that are not entirely true. In science, there are so-called reasons and principles. The thinking itself is a series of interconnected and interdependent phenomena. This is why the world never has unreasoned and accidental novel phenomena, nor sudden new events. Everything that seems new at first glance is actually a transformation of the old. Western medicine often uses science and novelty as a rallying cry, like holding the emperor hostage to command the princes. They are already benefiting from this. But to say that traditional medicine is absolutely unscientific is not right. Did Western medicine not evolve from the theory of the four humors and three elements to what it is today? Why can't Chinese medicine evolve from the theory of the seven prescriptions and ten dosages to reach science? Moreover, everything in the universe is material for science. To say that science is not enough to regulate Chinese medicine is to belittle Chinese medicine and to increasingly deviate from the scope of science that they use as a rallying cry.</p>
<p>Western medicine often falsely accuses Chinese medicine of being superstitious nonsense. But is Chinese medicine really knowledge or nonsense? The theory of the five movements and six qi is close to knowledge. But Chinese medicine shops do not sell the five movements and six qi. Chinese medicine prescriptions are not full of the five movements and six qi. They are only used as an auxiliary for research. However, we are not forever unwilling to improve. This is the origin of the saying that Chinese medicine should be scientific. This is the origin of the proposal to establish a National Medical Museum. To bring Chinese medicine to the realm of science and to bring Chinese medicine to the path of physics and chemistry is what we earnestly hope for the National Medical Museum and what we are willing to work together with the National Medical Museum to achieve. As for differentiating drugs into cold, hot, warm, and neutral, and differentiating diseases into internal injuries and external feelings, this is not nonsense, but is accurate. This is how diseases can be treated quickly and effectively. Western medicine divides the muscles of the human body into voluntary muscles and involuntary muscles. Voluntary muscles can be controlled by the mind and can move. Involuntary muscles can move freely even during sleep. Their analysis is very precise and their differences are very obvious. But are those who claim to be new doctors and scientific doctors different from the living and the dead? Are the healthy different from those under anesthesia? If there is no difference, then so be it. If there is a difference, then the respiratory and circulatory systems of the dead body have stopped. The voluntary muscles and sensory organs have become ineffective when a person is anesthetized for surgery. So, are the phenomena obtained from anatomy and surgery the phenomena of a normal person? Therefore, the theory of qi transformation in Chinese medicine is sometimes superior to the experience that Western medicine obtains from the dead. Which school of thought is knowledge and which is nonsense? The truth is in people's hearts. There is no need to make pointless arguments. As for comparing diagnosis by color and sound to blind doctors, these are just the words of rude children and shrewish women. They are unbearably vulgar and irredeemably foolish. There is no point in refuting them.</p>
<p>The words of Yang Quan's Theory of Physics are ignorant of the essence of Chinese medicine. Rhubarb drains and angelica relieves pain. But they do not know that the same fullness should be treated with major qi-regulating decoction if it is in the upper body, qi-regulating stomach-harmonizing decoction if it is in the middle body, and honey-fried guide if it is in the lower body to unblock it. The same accumulation is treated differently. Divine leaven eliminates food accumulation, dragon bone eliminates wheat accumulation, hawthorn eliminates meat accumulation, and tangerine peel eliminates fish accumulation. The same pain is treated differently. Dahurian angelica treats orthodox headaches, asarum treats migraines, mulberry leaves and chrysanthemums treat feverish headaches, cinnamon twig treats arm pain, gentian treats wind pain, coridius treats 　pain, left golden pill treats left hypochondriac pain, qi-dispersing powder treats right hypochondriac pain, mulberry mistletoe treats waist pain, deer antler treats back 　pain, peony and licorice treat abdominal pain, and achyranthes and clematis treat leg and knee pain. Angelica is only a tonic for blood deficiency pain and should be avoided for qi stagnation, stomach pain, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Chinese medicine doctors can prescribe medicine and see results instantly, like a shadow following a pole. Is this as simple as the examples given by Western medicine?</p>
<p>As for saying that a fever lasting for several days is warm evil, there is also careful differentiation and confirmation in this. This is not something that can be loosely called a deer and then called a horse. I would like to ask if Western medicine always calls a common cold or cough influenza? Chinese medicine also differentiates between many symptoms of insomnia, and never generally calls it liver qi. There are those who cannot sleep because the stomach is not harmonized, those who cannot sleep because of fatigue and vexation, those who cannot sleep after illness, those who cannot sleep when old, those who think too much, those who have phlegm obstructing internally, those who have a fever that is too high and are restless and cannot sleep, and those who have vomited 　and have wrongly sweated and cannot sleep. The causes of the disease are different, and the prescriptions are different. How can it be said that the treatment of the disease is always the same? Those who are hot should be cooled, and those who are cold should be warmed. Moreover, they have not yet invented specific drugs, and the so-called specific drugs also come from abroad and cannot fully suit the constitution of the Chinese people. Can this be compared on the same day? If they do not know the efficacy of the drugs, then how can they make such extreme and derogatory statements? They will collapse on their own and only show their deep animosity towards traditional medicine. The funding for the National Medical Museum is only one-twelfth of the previous Ministry of Health and one-eighth of the current Ministry of Health. They think that if the National Medical Museum does not proceed according to their designated methods, it is a waste. Their deep desire for the National Medical Museum to live or die reveals their microscopic vision and their inability to see the big picture. They also show their deep regret for the National Medical Museum. Moreover, these people imitate the superficial aspects of Western medicine and promote the sale of foreign drugs. The country spends a lot of money to run medical schools for decades and create so-called medical doctors. What have they invented? What have they improved? They only say what the foreigners say. They only invade when others invade. They do not admonish themselves with the poem of the field rat, but instead falsely criticize the words of flattery. They do not know that a gentleman forgives anger. A gentleman is like happiness, and his words and deeds are carefully considered. What is the use of their inflammatory rhetoric? Alas, my compatriots know that the young are easily forced. They have just escaped the poison of thousands of years of autocratic politics and are now being robbed by scientific medicine and pharmaceuticals. If traditional Chinese medicine has any shortcomings or inadequacies, then they should write on the prescription and ask the patient to seek another expert. Scientific Western medicine is not like this. If you enter the hospital, you will either get better or you will die. Those who can afford to leave the hospital halfway have many troubles, and those who cannot afford it cannot do so. Moreover, many deaths are not reported and are arbitrarily dissected. Is this not autocracy? The association is worried that you do not know the essence of new and old medicine. I dare to present a brief outline, although it is not enough to dispel your doubts, it can at least inform the public and correct the situation.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Sir, Yesterday's newspaper reported that our company purchased the land of the Sanxin Yarn Factory. We have investigated and found that our company has not purchased the land of the factory and has no intention of purchasing it. The report is probably a rumor. Please publish this letter to clarify the facts. Da Lai Foreign Company.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read in your newspaper's local news on March 18 that Chen Youming accused Dr. Yuan Wenduo of misusing ephedra, asarum, and dried ginger. Chen came to my residence for treatment, and I did not mention it. I think it was spread by outsiders.</p>
<p>I am writing this letter to clarify the matter. Please correct it. I would be grateful. Sincerely, Zhou Jianbang, March 21.</p>

<h3 id="e155">A Tragic Report from Kang Jiyao <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Chairman of the North China Charity Federation, is enthusiastically running around for the Shaanxi disaster. He sacrificed his position as a member of the Supervisory Yuan to come to Shanghai to raise funds. He is willing to go to Shaanxi again to provide relief. All sectors of the city admired his sincerity and formed the Shanghai Emergency Relief Fund Committee for the Shaanxi Disaster. Since its establishment, it has achieved great results, demonstrating that everyone has a heart of compassion. Mr. Zhu set up a banquet at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant the night before he left Shanghai to publicly invite fellow villagers and members of the China Merchants Cigarette Association to report on the disaster situation and ask them to donate as much as they could. He also introduced Mr. Kang Jiyao, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Committee, to the guests, saying that Mr. Kang had served as the Director of the Shaanxi Finance Department and was respected for his morality and writing. Recently, he also gave up his political career to focus on charity. He is very knowledgeable in Buddhism. He came to Shanghai from Shaanxi yesterday. Recently, he personally went to the disaster area to investigate. The situation he saw was more accurate than what I saw when I was providing relief in Shaanxi two months ago. So I specially invited him to attend and report. Mr. Kang is tall and thin, wearing a woolen gown and a black waistcoat. He has beautiful whiskers and holds a Buddhist rosary. He is fifty-one years old and in good spirits. At first glance, he resembles Mr. Wen Lantong, a prominent figure in Shanghai's business community. That night, Mr. Wen happened to be hosting a banquet in the next room. A gentleman at the next table said that tonight is like a double package deal. How could two philanthropists be so similar? Mr. Kang stood up and gave a speech. First, he bowed to the guests and thanked them on behalf of all the disaster victims in Shaanxi. Then, he said that the reports on the Shaanxi disaster only covered two or three tenths of the actual situation. At first, when I received reports from the branch committees in various counties, I thought they were exaggerated and was skeptical. So I personally went to the disaster area to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The situation I saw was very tragic. Looking out over the barren fields, there was nothing but corpses. Not only were there starving people everywhere, but also corpses that had been accumulating for more than a year were still exposed, and no one was cleaning them up. To give you an example, there are a hundred families in Xinglin Town and only thirty households in Bawang Village. In one case, there were more than fifty corpses hidden in the house. In the other case, there were more than twenty corpses that had not been buried. In Wulin County, there were even more than thirteen thousand corpses exposed in the wilderness, and no one was taking care of them. I recall that there was also a major disaster in Shaanxi during the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu. The Qing court allocated a large sum of money to provide relief. But the disaster at that time was not as severe as the one in recent years, and the duration was not as long as this time. Now, when I go to the countryside to investigate the disaster, there is no one for dozens of miles. You don't need to use your eyes or ears, you just need to use your nose. Because when your nose smells foul odors, you know that the area is full of corpses and the disaster is severe. I hope that the gentlemen present will donate as much as they can. Those who cannot afford to donate money can spread the word and encourage others to donate. The Buddha said that there are four ways to give, but the merit is the same. Donating money is giving wealth. Encouraging others to donate is giving the Dharma. Comforting people who are afraid is giving fearlessness. Having a good thought when you cannot help is giving with your heart. Then, Mr. Cha Liangzhao, who had been bound and held captive by bandits for eighty-one days because of his relief efforts, reported on what he had witnessed in Shaanxi. He said that the severity of the Shaanxi disaster was too great to enumerate. I will present one or two things to give you a general idea. Wugong County used to be very prosperous. Last year, because the horse was sick, I wanted to buy two eggs as medicine, but I searched for dozens of miles and couldn't find any. Because the corpses had not been buried and the starving people were on their way, all the tree bark and grass roots had been eaten. There were no chickens or dogs left. How could there be chicken eggs? From this, you can imagine the tragic situation. There are other things, but I am afraid that after I describe them, you will not be able to eat. Therefore, I will not go into detail. Everyone was deeply saddened and willing to donate as much as they could. They also asked Mr. Zhu and Mr. Cha to continue providing relief in Shaanxi. The banquet ended at 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>Qiu Jin of Shaoxing competed for greatness in the autumn. She dedicated herself to the revolution and sacrificed her life for righteousness. Her heroic spirit and righteous deeds shine brightly through the ages. To commemorate this martyr, the Shaoxing County government has specially established halls for Cheng Zhang, Xi Lin, and Qiu Jin in Zhongshan Park, displaying the portraits and various mementos of the martyrs. Furthermore, a Wind and Rain Pavilion was built on the summit of Fu Mountain to commemorate Qiu Jin's line, "Autumn wind and rain are devastating," which she uttered when facing imminent danger. Additionally, a monument over ten feet tall was erected at Xuan Ting Kou, the place where Qiu Jin faced her execution. It was constructed purely of cement and aggregate, with the six large characters "Monument to Female Knight Qiu" inscribed on the upper layer of the front. Below, a bronze plaque bears the four characters "Heroine Among Women," a posthumous tribute by President Sun. After diligent construction, it will soon be completed, and a dedication ceremony will be held.</p>
<h3 id="e157">On Mr. Wang Xuequan's Affairs <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Liwu</p>
<p>The gentleman's surname is Wang, given name Dingsheng, courtesy name Xuequan. His family has lived in Xian Village, She County, Anhui, for generations. Mr. Wang was born after his father, Mr. Xu Zhi, had passed away. He relied on his mother, Madam Xu, for upbringing and education. Mr. Wang was extraordinarily intelligent and mature beyond his years. At a young age, he studied the classics in Ru Zui Township. Later, he went to Heji Pawnshop in Changle Town, Haimen, and was soon promoted to treasurer. He then took on additional responsibilities. Mr. Jin, who was in charge of the pawnshop, resided in Shanghai and rarely visited throughout the year. Whether matters were significant or trivial, internal or external, he relied solely on Mr. Wang. Those who bear responsibility inevitably face complaints. Moreover, within the residency, petty people were in power, and the advancement or retreat of servants depended on their whims. They ostracized those who differed from them. Mr. Wang once upheld justice and wrote a letter to the resident, eloquent and forceful, filled with truth and righteousness, leaving no room for suppression. However, this further provoked the anger of the petty people. Slander and destruction intensified, leading to Mr. Wang's demotion to treasurer of Baochang Pawnshop in Bird Town. Mr. Wang read the resident's letter and smiled without anger. He replied with sincere gratitude, only pleading to resign due to his mother's old age and frequent illness. That winter, Mr. Wang returned home promptly to care for his mother. He also enclosed a small garden, planting flowers and stacking stones. Although lacking the grandeur of pavilions and towers, the undulating mountains brought greenery through the gate, sufficient to bring joy. Mr. Wang planned to retire and live in seclusion, reading and painting, fulfilling his desire for a small retreat. However, Mr. Liu Chengru of Nanxun, admired Mr. Wang's virtue and eagerly sought to recruit him. He entrusted someone to convey his intentions. Mr. Wang then went with Mr. Shen Lükui. Before they could even settle down, they felt like they had known each other for a long time. Mr. Liu also entrusted him with the affairs of Youxi Estate. The local people were cunning and often resisted paying rent. Mr. Wang forcefully rectified the situation, eliminating the accumulated abuses. All his plans were organized and methodical, greatly improving the collection of rent. Mr. Liu appreciated his ability even more and relied on him deeply. Last autumn, when Mr. Wang was at home, he suffered from a carbuncle on his face, which became dangerously severe. Acquaintances were worried about him. Fortunately, due to the efficacy of medicine, he recovered. Mr. Wang was secretly delighted and happily returned east. Who knew that disaster would strike unexpectedly, taking his life in a foreign land? Previously, troops stationed in Changzhou had infiltrated the surrounding villages. On the night of the fourth day of the twelfth month, a band of bandits suddenly arrived at the estate, plundering at will. Mr. Wang was loyal to his duty and unwilling to easily reveal the location of the hidden gold to the bandits, leading to their rage. He suffered a gunshot wound, hitting a vital spot, and could not be saved. At Shen hour on the seventh day of the twelfth month, he died in Wujin Hospital. Alas, how painful! Mr. Wang was intelligent and studious, excelling in writing, especially in official documents. When he was working at Changle, Mr. Zhang Jian, the Duke of Nantong, was developing transportation. He planned to demolish the Heji Pawnshop to clear the navigation route. Mr. Wang wrote a letter, arguing forcefully and unyielding, hitting the essential points, and ultimately stopping the demolition plan. Mr. Wang was amiable and approachable, especially chivalrous and righteous. Now, he has suffered this unusual misfortune. Oh, vast heavens, what will you say to this? I have known Mr. Wang for a long time and know his character in detail. Therefore, I write this biography, not only to record his admirable deeds but also to express my sorrow.

<h3 id="e158">Gleanings from the Fudan Female Students' Get-Together <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>The female dormitory of Fudan University in Jiangwan is renowned as the "Eastern Palace" of the sea. The palace mistresses, however, do not acknowledge this themselves. Recently, they organized a female student association to promote virtue and learning. The other evening, they held a get-together in the dining hall. The scene was filled with the glittering of hairpins and the swaying of tresses, reaching the height of splendor. The curtain rose with Ms. Liang Peishu as chairwoman and Ms. Fan Tongzhang as recorder. The proceedings were formal, and several important motions were passed. Finally, entertainment was added, with singing and dancing of unparalleled beauty. Here are some gleanings from the event to enrich this account.</p>
<p>The entertainment began, and the first to win applause was Ms. Wang Baomin's Peking opera tune, "Phoenix Hairpin." Ms. Wang is in her blossoming years, with braids over her shoulders. Her voice is melodious, and her demeanor charming and innocent. Her first attempt at singing silenced the clouds. The audience was amazed. It is said that Ms. Wang has studied with famous opera singers, so every time she sings, one feels that "this song should only exist in heaven." She knows many operas. She is graduating from the Department of Sociology this term and is known as a highly talented student.</p>
<p>Next was a comedic dance performed by a man and a woman. Ms. Zhou Changming dressed in men's clothing and a hat, resembling a dashing young man. Ms. Li Suzhen played a country girl. Together, they performed the Charlestown dance, deliberately making mistakes to elicit laughter. They also sang the Fengyang Flower Drum song, making the audience smile. This kind of dance that blends Chinese and foreign elements is fresh and charming, full of interest. Therefore, after the dance, the cries of "one more!" did not cease.</p>
<p>The next act was a speech delivered by a local and a foreigner. Ms. Liang Peishu, the previously dignified and respected chairwoman, played a corrupt old gentleman. Her companion was a comedic local pretending to be foreign, played by Ms. Guo Zhenyl of the Department of Journalism. Ms. Guo gave a speech in a pidgin language, which Ms. Liang translated into Yangzhou dialect. Their expressions and accents were hilarious. Both ladies are fluent in English and Chinese, reaching the height of artistry.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a two-person comic act by Ms. Guo Zhenyl and Ms. Fan Tongzhang. Ms. Guo, originally from Hubei, played a young girl from Hubei, calling herself a candidate. Ms. Fan, a native of Ningbo, played a young lady from Ningbo who had just arrived in the city, speaking with a full Ningbo accent. The audience was in stitches.</p>
<p>There were many other entertainment programs, including the singing and dancing of Ms. Hu Heping, Ms. Ouyang Meide, and others, all of which were excellent. The get-together ended joyfully around ten o'clock. It is said that the association recently initiated the Shanghai Young Women's Aspiration Society and has gained the support of female student associations from various universities. Ms. Guo Zhenyl, Ms. Liang Peishu, Ms. Wang Baomin, and others will represent the society. The International Women's Day celebration on March 8 will be organized by the society. In the future, the society's get-togethers will be even larger in scale.</p>
<h3 id="e159">New Films in Paris <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— She Yu</p>
<p>Recently, various movie theaters have been competing to screen new films, emerging endlessly, which can be described as a prosperous time. Among them, sound films are particularly abundant in supply. Unfortunately, most focus on divinity and idealism, and there are not many exciting plot-driven films. The Paris Cinema on Hualong Road has always been known for its carefully selected silent films. With its excellent location and affordable ticket prices, its business has flourished, surpassing previous records. A month ago, the manager of the cinema, Mr. Han, said that sound films would be screened. Yesterday, the press was invited to attend a trial screening of "A Woman's Diversion," the sound film he had chosen. The film stars a famous Russian actress. The plot revolves around a coachman who is seduced by a noblewoman, causing his perfect family to break apart. His son dies, and his wife flees. When he seeks solace from the noblewoman, she rejects him coldly, only regarding him as a temporary diversion, not true love. He is also ridiculed by many. The acting is deeply insightful and extremely thorough. The depiction of the social classes and their various situations is also exceptionally powerful. I believe that after watching this film, the audience will understand that the title of the film contains a significant warning.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On November 13th, at 3 PM, I boarded a ship to Calcutta, India, at the Latt Pier. Wang Fangyuan brought his child to see me off and took care of everything. Chen Yitong left on the same day for Penang. I was supposed to sit in the third-class cabin due to the tropical heat and bought a ticket for sixteen yuan. The ship departed from Yangon at 5 PM, heading east initially, then turning south into the Bay of Bengal, sailing west towards India.</p>
<p>November 14th. The seawater in the distance appeared black, like the black sea of the Bohai Sea. I felt very comfortable on the ship. There was no wind. The ship was filled with Indians, with only three or four Chinese. There was a Cantonese woman who lived in India and an antique merchant who traded in Calcutta. In the tropics, people generally drink raw water, and I am used to it. It is very suitable and can also be used for showering. A large ship is better than a small steamer. There are many vendors selling various foods on the ship. Eating Indian food costs four annas a meal, which is very cheap. I observed the clothing issue of the Indians and gradually realized that there was no need for elaborate clothing. The Indians had no so-called clothes, just a piece of cloth draped around their bodies. However, they wrapped it in a specific way, like the Guanyin figure in Chinese paintings, which is entirely based on Indian women's clothing. For the Indian people, one piece of cloth is sufficient for clothing. In winter, they add a blanket, which they drape over themselves at night or wear as a robe. It can also be used as formal wear for attending any banquet. For ordinary people, one piece of cloth is sufficient for both day and night. If they want to be clean, two pieces of cloth can be used for washing. Now, most Indians use Gandhi's non-cooperation method, weaving and using their own cloth. All foreign goods are not selling well, so British machines are useless. However, it is also because the Indians originally had no clothing problem, so Gandhi's teachings are easy to implement.</p>
<p>November 16th. At 8 AM, we arrived in Calcutta. My three pieces of luggage were searched very thoroughly, regardless of passports, but checking for writing. The goods were unloaded, and a coolie charged one and a half yuan for a horse-drawn carriage to the Maha Bodhi Society at George Square. This Buddhist society was founded in 1892 by Dharmapala. It has branches in London and New York. The first Buddhist temple is currently being built in Sarnath, along with a university. The Chinese monk Taixu has promised to send ten students. They publish a monthly English newspaper. There is a library and reading room, and many Buddhist books and photos are published. Those who wish to buy them can remit money to the address listed above. The upper floor is a Buddhist hall, with a fascinating depiction of Buddhist history. When entering the hall to worship, one must take off shoes. However, the floor is covered with cement, which is extremely clean and dust-free. The construction costs of this society are 50,000 yuan. It was initially founded thanks to a woman from Honolulu, Mrs. Mirry, who donated 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>November 17th. I visited Consul Lu Chunfang and Wang Zhiyuan of the party branch. Most of the overseas Chinese here are Cantonese. There is no newspaper yet, but they are working on it. Chinatown is the old lane of Indian Right Time, very dilapidated and narrow. There are extremely poor people, as poor as the poor households in our country. However, the people who come to India seem to have lived here for a long time, even for generations. There is a large Cantonese hotel, with Chen Zhengping as the manager. I saw many Westerners eating there, as well as wealthy Indians coming in pairs, wearing impressive clothes. Gandhi's doctrine is difficult to implement among the wealthy.</p>

<h3 id="e161">The Tides of Gold Market <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The price of gold rose by six taels yesterday. The price of gold that was benchmarked on March 21st has slightly increased again. The state is still very chaotic and unpredictable. It is a wave of ups and downs. From morning to noon, there were sixteen or seventeen taels of disparity. As for the foreign exchange situation, it seems stable, but the prices are not moving. The overseas silver market seems to be trending differently, with England rising and America falling. The gold price should open high. Minor brokers traded smoothly. Many parties increased their holdings, and short sellers also pushed in. Companies like Fuchang, Yuanheng, Chengfeng, Yongxin, Henghengxing, and Yuan were mainly buying, while Yuanmao, Yonghengxing, and Yuantai were mainly selling. Later, the market price once fell within six hundred and ninety taels, as the exchange bills were insufficient and sales came from the Guangdong group. Coupled with the excitement of buyers and the arbitrage of English gold within the industry, the bank selling price was only calculated at three pence eight seven five. This led to a surge of wind and waves, frequently moving forward, surging more than ten taels and suddenly exceeding seven hundred taels. However, the situation was fleeting, and people were at a loss. Finally, there was a latent softening trend in the afternoon due to the Saturday market closure. Looking back to last week, the market atmosphere was extremely chaotic. It coincided with the swap period, and in these six days of May, there were more than fifty-one taels of twists and turns. On this swap date (16th), the first session rose by thirteen taels.</p>
<p>Bizarre and Unpredictable. The five-month opening price in the morning was six hundred and ninety-one taels and five mace, plus one tael and a half. Although the big bars rose by three sixteenths, the silver price was reduced by one eighth. However, the private telegrams rose by one sixteenth, so people’s minds were stable and did not fall. Then, due to Yongheng, Fuyu, and other buyers stopping, it continued to rise to ninety-five taels. However, Yuanmao, Yongzhi, Feng, Yongtong, Taichang, Henghengxing, and others came to sell, and English gold was also quoted by HSBC Mitsui at four pence, so the gold price plummeted by more than seven taels to only eighty-seven taels and five mace. Soon, Chengfeng, Yongyu, Dayuanheng, and others bought, and it rose by four taels again. When the shilling was announced, it was ninety-two taels, and the listed price was slightly lower than before at ninety taels and zero five mace. Chengfengyong and others' buying enthusiasm did not cease, and Macgarie and others bought English gold at four pence and zero six two five. At nine and three-quarters, it rose as high as ninety-six taels. Henghengxing Dadecheng and others sold again, falling more than four taels. After ten o'clock, it was nine and a half taels. Later, Mitsui ate June English gold at four pence, and Fuxing, Yongfu, Fuyu, and others bought in, gradually rising. By ten forty, it had risen to about seven hundred taels. Then, Yiyu, Fuchang, Yu Dahenghengxingyuan and others pursued the purchase, rising another three or four taels in a short time. Qianchangxiang and others dragged in, especially because English gold was better and more abundant, with banks such as Heyifeng Mac issuing May and June at one three eight seven five. By eleven o'clock, it had reached seven hundred and four taels, and rumors in the market said that a certain bank wanted to purchase spot goods, so people's hearts became more agitated. Later, Henghengxing Yuanmao Yong and others had a strong intention to sell, and the six-month English gold at three pence nine three seven five could be settled, so the storm suddenly rose and fell calmly, dropping more than seven taels in half an hour. At eleven thirty, it was six hundred and ninety-six taels and five mace. Suddenly, the zero accounts fell into their hands, and it immediately rose to seven hundred and two taels. In a moment, it returned to weakness, as Henghengxing and others sold, but there was not much volume. In fact, it was a state of people's hearts floating and being timid. It had already broken through seven hundred taels. The market closed at noon at six hundred and ninety-six taels, which was six taels higher than the previous day. Then it suppressed a small amount of more than one tael, with a total of ninety-five taels. The maximum price in the morning and afternoon was seven hundred and four taels, and the minimum price was six hundred and eighty-seven taels and five mace, with a difference of sixteen taels and five mace. Goods were quoted at ninety-two taels in the early market and ninety-five taels in the noon closing. The announced price was still seven hundred and fifty-three taels, with a difference of sixty-one or two taels. Ten taels were collected at noon for fifty-seven or eight taels. The three-month account was recorded at eighty-nine taels, the four-month at ninety-two taels, the five-month at ninety-six taels, and the water supplement at eighty-nine taels.</p>
<p>Speculative Desire is Strong. The transaction accounts include Yuanheng, Yongheng, Fuchang, Henghengxing Yuan, Yuda, Yiyu, Chengfengyong, Tianyuyongfuxingyong, and others who have entered Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Futaiheng, Yuancheng, and others who have been coming and going are very prosperous. Yuanmaoyong, Henghengxing, Ruikang, Yuantai, Wanxing, Tongtaichang, etc. have sold all head covers have come in and out because exchange bills are packed and not one Guangbang again sold eight or nine hundred of the Dalian belt with a total of more than a thousand bars and entered nine hundred bars.</p>

<p>The Chinese merchants demand is greater than the supply. Yesterday, the English and American silver markets were slightly different. The exchange rate was low. As for the Shanghai market, there was no major change. The HSBC listed price has not changed, except for Hong Kong adding two or five to calculate seventy-eight taels. However, the internal disks of the English, American, and Japanese markets fluctuated slightly. The situation was still flat in the morning, but then it became apparent and then stable. It was still in a downward trend at noon. The gold market was still turbulent, rising and falling sharply. There was a difference of sixteen or seventeen taels in half a day. As a result, the noon closing price of each exchange rate was slightly higher than the previous night. The English gold was reduced by zero six two five US dollars, the US dollar was long one two five Japanese gold, and the Chinese merchants trading activities such as Fuchang, Runchangyu and others all included arbitrage for English gold only Shengda and others sold some sets of tickets Banks such as HSBC Macgarie Mitsui Sumitomo Taiwan Heyifeng etc. all sold Mai Bank Korean Mitsui Sumitomo also absorbed the total number of Chinese merchants asking more than the supply various banks did a little right totaling more than 200,000 pounds and the US dollar only 200,000 yuan traded in and out.

<p>The yarn market was tired in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the trend is still tight, because the surrounding environment is good and the actual needs are developing daily. The period is in the spring sales, and the Chinese yarn output to foreign countries is still good. Because the Dongyang yarn price is high, the local yarn is cheaper, so the purchase is endless. Therefore, the Southern Ocean Bank is searching for Japanese yarn in the market quite smoothly. It is heard that the Sichuan gang is negotiating between the two sides due to water feet problems, or a large number of transactions will be concluded. However, the general retail investors are doing their best to sell off their thick bottoms, and they will come out as soon as they rise slightly. However, according to the actual situation, this year's situation is better than this time last year. First, the Japanese yarn price last year was low and came to China, but now it is the opposite. Secondly, the domestic situation is quieter and the raw materials are expensive. There are these two major reasons, and a certain giant merchant's bullish attitude is tough. However, the current demand is too stagnant, so it is not perfect.</p>
<p>The early morning of the artificial label was soft and the afternoon was strong. The pre-market of the artificial label opened with the American cotton fatigue, and the market fell slightly. Each fell three to four cents, but the second and third sessions rose several cents. As a result, each fell two, four, five and eight cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that Sichuan Gang had launched a large number of transactions. The more determined people are, the tighter the market trend is. Each rose four, six and eight cents. The turnover statistics were 13,850 bales. It was found that Zhen Da sold 1,100 bales, Mingde 450 bales, and Tianlong 950 bales. Yichang bought 450 bales and bought Gongtai 900 bales, Xincheng 1,750 bales, Shenji 650 bales, and Yiyu 800 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.

<p>The cotton market is slightly weakened by the influence of dull foreign cotton. Because American cotton is dull and people's hearts are softened, and the sales of existing cotton in various factories are not smooth, the cloth is therefore relatively sluggish. However, due to the scarcity of bottom goods, new short sellers do not take reckless actions, so transactions are particularly calm and the volume of transactions is quite small.</p>
<p>Hankow Standard Scattered. The Hankow Standard market opened with foreign cotton flat. Gold prices suddenly rose and fell, and people's hearts were inconsistent, so each fell by 1 qian or 2.5 qian in total. The afternoon market was extremely scattered, each rising by 5 fen. The total transaction volume was 19,700 dan. It was found that Tongxing sold 700 dan, Yicheng 900 dan, and Taixing 600 dan. Yongfeng bought 2,500 dan, Yiyu 900 dan, and Xincheng 700 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.

English cotton futures fell by 12 points, and spot fell by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot was unchanged. The Indian cotton market was weak.

<p>A telegram from New York on the 20th reports on the cotton market during the week. The cotton market was strong last week, rebounding about half of the previous week's decline, due to buying by the industry and short covering, and also due to reduced supply when prices fell. When the May price reached above 11 cents, the supply slightly increased, but spot goods in the South were reportedly still being held firmly. Currently, people in the industry all regard the arrangement of new cotton as the principle of revitalization, and even use the stock market situation as a barometer of the market. Private reports indicate that the reduction in cotton fields is between 30% and 20%. The textile market lacks activity, and speculators are also waiting for the development of new cotton and the attitude of the Agricultural Administration Bureau. Weather conditions are conducive to cotton field work. Attached are the weekend statistics as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<p>Inland quotations soften again.  In Zhabei yesterday, about 40 boats from various gangs arrived, but sales remained sluggish. Northern粳rice was selling well, and new supplies were arriving, so once it hit the market, it sold poorly. The market immediately saw a drop. Yesterday afternoon, due to urgent sales by cargo customers, the price dropped by 1 jiao. Foreign thin rice had a clear path, and shops and stomachs were waiting and watching, with the overall market slumping by 1 jiao. Yang Du tip and guest port tip arrived sparsely, and stomachs were reluctantly maintaining the original price. Tongbian Yin Yuan sales field was mediocre, and prices remained unchanged for the time being. The overall situation of the day was only that the 粳 and thin rice markets were the most sluggish.</p>
<p>In Shanghai South, boats arriving from the river yesterday had a slightly better path. Changxi Northern粳rice had a small number of guest stomachs inquiring, so the market generally turned stable. Tongbai sales field was also active, and the market was unremarkable. Southern rice, early rice arrived and sold poorly, high prices in the middle, secondary slightly soft. Yang Du籼arrived very little, and guest gang's path was slightly brisk. 大still had no up and down, and Bai Yuan sales were not smooth. Diaofan Two stomachs only erased the top and purchased. Ordinary was sluggish. The situation was barely stable. Now, considering the northern and southern situations gradually to the right, there is hope for stability. However, at present, the road quotation is softening again, and the market situation will inevitably change again.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Flour Market Steps Downward <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month was quite stable at the beginning of the current month. However, the opening price of the forward saw a sharp contraction. Although the price of foreign wheat did not rise or fall much, and the gold market also saw a slight turnaround, the current trend seemed to have shifted to reality, and there was little relationship with the exchange rate. Because the chips set were all real, the short position felt unusually stable. This was a fact recognized by all parties. The decline in the morning was driven by foreign flour, because the telegram of 2.7 yuan for Flag Flour had been transferred. Brokers such as Zhao had already finalized 20,000 bags, so people's hearts were very empty and unanimously moved downward. In the afternoon, for this reason, factories continued to sell off greatly, so they all fell wearily. It seemed that foreign wheat stopped dumping, and foreign flour was revived. In this situation where one wave was not yet settled and another wave rose again, the bleak future can be foreseen. The June, July, and August months all broke through the 2 liang mark, and the near term also fell sharply at the same time. As a result, March and April fell sharply by 3 fen and 2.5 li, May fell by 3.5 fen, and June fell by 2 fen and 7 li, and July and August fell by 3 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month saw a state of decline. Because the current month was approaching delivery, although the receiving party was also around 100 cars, the deliverers were between 200 cars. The long and short sides were balanced, and there seemed to be a surplus. Therefore, floating longs and speculators could no longer resist and closed their positions one after another. The future months became more and more deserted because it was rumored that foreign flour had opened up again, and the need for wheat in the future became more and more cold. And the weather was unusually good and bad. In a flash, the new wheat had a considerable relationship, so the selling was strong and the fall was very large. As a result, the current month fell by 7 fen from the previous day, April fell by 4 fen, May fell by 5 fen, and June, July, and August fell by 4 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e174">North-South Goods: Sophora Flower Rice, High Land Price <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged lack of supply, the market price of Sophora flower rice is unusually firm. It is found that the price at the origin is higher than that in Shanghai. According to the letter, it is about 6 liang. The goods here once opened at 5 liang to 4 liang and 8 qian. The inventory in the market is less than a thousand pieces. The Nanyang gang recently handled 200 to 300 pieces at a price of 5 liang. Yesterday, the market sold at 5 liang 2 qian to 5 liang. The trend is quite stable.</p>

Shoulao printed colored Ting at 2 qian 5 fen, Yang Guifei colored feather silk at 2 qian 7 fen, and Zijinshan striped colored Ting at 2 qian 3.5 fen all had purchases. Imperial satin slightly rose yesterday due to the gradual depletion of hand goods. Four Scholars was 3 qian 3.5 fen, First Merit 3 qian 4.5 fen, Three Friends 3 qian 2.5 fen, and Heavenly Fortune 4 qian 1 fen. Yuan Yang yarn was slightly stronger because the Shantou gang was searching for it quite diligently. Dian Qiuxiang was already at 10 liang 0.5 qian, and Yuan Ji Beauty was at 10 liang 0.4 qian. Hui Guangxie tended to fall, and Qianbei Li Jin Wengong was around 5 liang 1 qian. Imperial satin also rebounded. The Zhenjiang gang needed a lot of different colors. The Great Wall Riding Horse opened at 3 qian 1.5 fen, and Circus 3 qian 1 fen, which was about 1 fen higher than before.

<h3 id="e178">Hardware: Enamel Factory Searches for Black Iron Sheet <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>After the continued arrival of Dongyang lead wire, the market image of black iron sheet has been very deserted since the guest gangs stopped handling it. The standard has therefore stepped down. For example, 2.6 chi is only sold for 12 liang, and 3.6 chi is 11 liang and 5 qian, and the guest families still have no acceptance. In the past two or three days, enamel factories suddenly rushed to handle it (it is heard that there is a large batch of military material package drop), resulting in a very lively news of handling for a while, and people's hearts have turned for the better. The standard is very firm. Although there were as many as 23400 bundles in the period six yesterday, the price was 12 liang 1.5 qian for 2.6 chi and 11 liang 7.5 qian for 3.6 chi.</p>
<p>Since Dongyang's own white leather came to China, recently, such as new lead wire and洋lead, etc., have also come to Shanghai one after another, causing the Shanghai Western goods market to be greatly impacted. Yesterday, more than 2,000 bundles of Dongyang lead wire were shipped again. Because of this, the local market is even more chaotic, and the standard future is more likely to have a dynamic atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Coal: Songpu Coal Price Drops by Half a Liang <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The coal trade has been very deserted in recent days. The weather is gradually getting warmer, and the demand is decreasing day by day. In addition, the overall market is expensive, and all those who buy in the same industry have a relaxed heart. Therefore, there are not many transactions in the market every day except for coal dross and lump coal used by factories. Yesterday, the total number of lump coal transactions in the city was less than 300 tons, so the overall market has slightly weakened. For example, Songpu lump coal has fallen by 5 qian yesterday, and the current sale price is 13 liang and a half per ton.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: 1400 pieces of cotton were transported to Dalian.</p>
<p>540 pieces of Huzhou silk were shipped to the United States.</p>
<p>300 tons of tung oil were shipped to New York.</p>
<p>800 pieces of rayon came from Italy and will arrive soon.</p>
<p>500 tons of railway track were shipped from London yesterday.</p>
<p>600 boxes of foreign wine were shipped from France.</p>
<p>460 boxes of tea were shipped to New York.</p>
<p>900 pieces of pigment were shipped from Germany.</p>
<p>A telegram from Hakodate states that the sale of dried squid is sluggish and the market price has fallen by 2.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hankou gang continued to handle 1,250 packages of kelp.</p>
