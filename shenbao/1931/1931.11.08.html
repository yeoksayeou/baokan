<p>時評</p>
<h3>田中奏摺的眞實性</h3>
<p>一九二七年七月日田中義一内閣。計劃積極侵略我東北四省并以危害世界極其酷烈的奏摺。天假其機。得被我國發現。使能將此一陰謀無情的揭露予全世界以一個嚴重的警告。</p>
<p>日本對於這一極其毒辣極其狂妄的陰謀之揭破。「做盜的心虚」。自然立即感受到異常的恐慌。但他們在口頭上却仍不得不百般狡賴。百般否認。當然「做事不認賬」。本是日本的政客和軍閥的慣技。而對於此一意外的打擊。除以狡辯與否認。企圖掩蔽世界的耳目而外。當亦再無他法。然而世界耳目。日人果眞能以一手掩盡嗎。</p>
<p>世界各國於今兹東北事件之爆發。已切實感受到田中陰謀之威脅。美英蘇聯等國新聞紙。已都將奏稿原文披露。日人對此。更爲驚愕。外務省特别發表否認文。指此奏摺爲僞製。並謂「此文一望而知其僞作。不能欺人」。各國輿論界惑於日人之强辭辯護。無以徵信多來電詢問事實之眞相。以及奏摺之何由得來。世界兹已注意及此。我們不能不認爲是世界和平前途一可喜的現象。</p>
<p>我們兹以極鄭重的態度公告世界各國。欲辯明田中奏摺之爲眞爲僞。應從近年來日本旣成的行動之事實堆中去分析體認。因爲事實勝於雄辯。日人自己的行爲。即是判斷田中奏摺之眞僞的公正的裁判人。至於此一奏摺之得來。世界各國固無詢問其究竟之必要。以某種手段取得與己國深有利害關係的秘件。世界各國不乏先例。世界但須認清此一秘件。性質的嚴重。於其得來之究竟。我們認爲似無探究之必要。</p>
<p>一九二七年六月二十七日。由田中主持在東京外相官邸舉行的東方會議及同年八月十五日舉行的旅順會議所决定的計劃。世界人士當還没曾忘記罷。當時日政友會所屬各團體在芝公園舉行祖國愛護的國民大會。並由飛機散佈傳單說。「解决人口問題的鎖匙。只在滿蒙積極政策。議會若反對應請即刻解散議會」。何以召集東方會議與旅順會議。東方會議與旅順會議决定了一些什麽。政友會何以有滿蒙積極政策之狂熱擁護。這些錚然的事實。最有廻溯的價值。換言之。即這些事實。是與是年七月間産生的田中奏摺有不可分離的因果關係。這其間蛛絲馬跡。已很足以使我們體認並把握田中奏摺之絕對眞實。並非僞造。</p>
<p>次之。再就日人近兩年來的行爲指明其爲田中陰謀之鐡證。如田中謂。「斯時也我之對美角逐義不容辭」。今日日朝野上下果一致認美政府爲其假想敵。報紙公然宣傳。絕不諱言。如奏章所載。「朝鮮移民獎勵及保護政策。」今果有一百餘萬以上之韓人僑居我東北。并果有萬寳山事件之爆發及韓人仇華之煽起。如奏摺所載「對内外蒙之積極政策。」今蒙古獨立運動。果正在日人煽惑之下積極進行。如奏摺中所謂「新大陸開拓與滿蒙積極政策」。今吉會鐡道果已在武裝保護之下强行敷設。其他一切鐡道。歷年更早在其原定計劃之下逐次實現。如奏摺中有謂「仍依伊籐及桂太郎合併朝鮮之旨。設立拓殖省。專管滿蒙進取之事務。」今果已有拓殖省之設立。并有「鮮滿一元」之呼聲。如奏摺中有謂「待有機會時。再向支那政府解决打通吉海支路問題。」今日人反對建築滿鐡平行綫的呼聲。果高響入雲。如奏摺中有謂「我日本爲欲自保而保他人。必須以鐡與血方能拔除東亞之難局。」今日人果突然不宣而戰。以暴力强佔我遼吉。就日人過去以及最近的行爲證之田中奏摺中之陰謀。正若合符節。日人一面切實執行田中的計劃。另一方面却矢口不承認奏摺的眞實。「夫誰欺欺天乎。」從這些恰可以互相印證的事實裏。世界人士當更可以認識并把握田奏摺之眞實。</p>
<p>再進一步說。此奏摺之揭露。在二年以前。而非在東北事件爆發以後。日外務省直至今日才正式否認。其心虚已可概見。奏摺計劃各方。極爲周密。與日本持以立國的大陸政策。恰相呼應就中涉及與各國秘密外交關係之處尤多。試一廻溯。當更可證明其絕非僞造。</p>
<p>我們深感此一陰謀之威脅。同時世界當亦深感此一陰謀之威脅。中國既已揭露此一危害世界之陰謀。世界究應怎樣予以嚴密的注意。并予以有效的裁制。世界各國當知所以自謀。最後我們敢鄭重聲言田中的奏稿。實是一顆足以毁滅世界毁滅人類的炸彈。世界愛護和平的人們。其注意毋忽。</p>

<h3>自作孽樂華落陷</h3>
<p>交手之下、曁南人物整齊、内外健全、最初十五分鐘内、半壁江山、絕少驚駭、如其前鋒進撰極厲、然亦無甚作爲、蓋樂華内衛嚴密及守門穏健所致也、迨至三十七分鐘時、樂華突告失守、由於陳鎭和自中傳左之際、樂華内衛陳志明截之、交與守門、正逢守門衝出挽救、相見適左、遂致落陷、</p>
<p>▲踢角球曁南再勝</p>
<p>樂華一球旣負、起而奮鬥、不久即衰、又受敵迫、斯時樂華陸鍾恩忽從對方三人鐡蹄之下、奪鬭出險、接連數次、甚爲觀衆嘉許、老將軍昔日威風、依然如故、最後二分鐘、符和宣踢角、落點適中、馮運佑趕上踢人、上半時二對零、曁南占先、</p>
<p>▲昂頭起一球進門</p>
<p>樂華在檸檬時間之後、先下强手、數度攻擊、無效而退、隆鍾恩身當大敵之前、從容對付、曁南知其長於上路、乃專攻卜路、梅洪寶羅海光二次平地射擊、均被陸氏挽救、十五分鐘時、樂華右翼李琳、暗渡陳倉、一脚挑中、右内萬象華迎之以頭、彈入門内、清切美麗、甚爲可觀、比數成一對二、</p>
<p>▲壓迫下連失三球</p>
<p>曁南大發虎威、包圍進攻、樂華兩内衛抵抗甚力、掙扎相待者、爲時頗久、顧壓迫之下、安能長保無事、未幾羅海光打中一球、符和萱亦切門射入、最後羅海光得馮運佑之球再獲一球、而以五對一獲勝、總之曁南實力、自較優勝、惟樂華亦出以九牛二虎之力、相與周旋、雖勝負懸殊、其間亦頗有可觀也、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>自遼東被倭奴侵佔以後。凡我國人。莫不憤慨。追憶甲午以前。東鄰早抱鯨吞之志。耳聞目見。泚筆記之。蓋亦見遺禍不自今始也。</p>
<p>▲伊籐博文之狂語</p>
<p>遜清光緒初年。伊籐遊海上。喜與文士遊。業師顧秋岩先生。與天南遯叟高昌寒食生申左夢畹生等文酒之宴。伊籐常在被邀之列。當筵唱和。對客揮毫。頗極一時之盛。顧先生題某君濯足扶桑圖。煞尾有句云。君不見一笛吹息朝鮮波。一劍削平日本島。伊籐一見。擊節欽佩。遂遞帖拜先生門下。時相過從。一夕酒酣。伊籐顧謂先生曰。不十年我邦將我事於中國矣。當時聞者均不在意。比及甲午變起始。知倭人早具决心。酒後漏洩。情不自禁也。孰謂倭人無深意哉。</p>

<h3>十萬封信之效力</h3>
<p>寗粤代表會議停頓後，敎育界有人提倡要十萬個學生，小學生，中學生，大學生每人寫一封信向代表會議請求和平統一共禦外侮。這是一個很有趣味的發明。這個發明引起我注意的地方，是它的數目方面之推測。</p>
<p>假使個個學生都遵照這位發明家之指示各人寫一封信，而每封信都投到戈登路伍公館；那麽，伍公館今天必須預備兩百張桌子，把這些信恭恭敬敬的收下來。</p>
<p>因爲外患急得很，代表們對於來信，等不及摘由，便隨到隨看，不使延誤。這些代表都是黨國要人，數年來，公事看得很快，像這樣重要的信，就是有一目十行的本領，連拆帶看，每封信一分鐘怕是不能再少了，十萬封信就得要十萬分鐘纔能看得完。平常工作是每天八小時，現在加緊辦事，作算是要幹十二小時，那麽看這些信至少便要一百四十一天的工夫。你們以後要問代表們爲什麽還不快快的和平統一呢？他們可以回答說，諸位來的信我們還没有看了咧。等我們看完你們的信，自然一定照辦。你們在明年三月二十七日，候我們的答復好了。</p>
<h3>日攫林産之回憶</h3>
<p>— 李胥梵</p>
<p>暴日攫我東北林産。蓄意已非一日。慨我國家多故。輒不計及。縱開交涉。靡不因循遷就。致東北森林。早被滿載而去。昨閱報紙遍載日軍又以砲擊黑省。不竟爲之裂眥。偶憶往事。録告讀者。當滿清光緒末季。周樹模巡撫黑省。鑒吉省林産豐富。擬採運入關。法固至善。曾命幕友考察。由黄興元計畫一切。奏准開採。次秋即從事砍伐。煞費經營。維時交通不便。運輸爲難。必渡鴨緑江。方克減程進關。第一批幸達關内。輾轉遍售北省。木商以質堅度長。幹粗圓直。優于他處之杉。舶來之松。不久即銷售一空。詎於二批裝渡鴨緑江時。已先爲日本偵悉。軍艦阻不許運。且强將木排奪去。清政府懦弱無能。交涉無效。從此大好森林。不僅我方難以水運。併繼採之權。亦已早被攫奪。周益無法挽回。徒耗數十萬元而罷。未幾周又因外交棘手引去。黄亦賦歸吳門。某年與彼把晤時談及往事。猶欷歔不止。可見在三十年前。暴日之對我東省利權。已實行侵佔。此次兵佔東省。當局不加抵抗。抑怯其先聲奪人歟。抑别有良策歟。殊難索解。亟願執政諸公。速决和平之議。一致對日。毋貽淪亡之禍也。</p>
<h3>國産飛機前途之暗礁</h3>
<p>— 宏</p>
<p>汽車編譯社張君富天。專攻汽車機械學。近年復好研究飛機學術。故於今春起。特犧牲其固有之經營事業。專從事於飛機之製造。發動機係以汽車上所用而改造者。其餘材料。完全採用國産。數月以來。謝絕一切。夜以繼日。親自搆造。且係獨資試辦。自本年五月國府航空會議後。即開始製造。費時半載。始終上月底完全工竣。按該機之搆造。完全仿照美國一九三零年式單乘輕便飛艇爲標準。發動機係利用風冷式四汽缸「亨特生」機脚車引擎改造而成。其餘材料。大都以國貨爲先。對於布漆等材料之選用。尤感困難。聞張君對於試飛場地之接洽。奔走已將一月。尙無把握。凡本埠各大航空機關。如中國航空公司及虹橋飛機廠。均經次第請求協助。但結果同遭拒絕。因此張君萬分失望。尤其在此半載製造期中。所有營業及經濟上之損失。已屬不資。如再出資租地試騐。則必更感困難。深望本埠各大學校願以操塲借助。俾其早日實騐成功。否則張君恐在迫不得已時。將全機轉讓於外人喜究此道者繼續進取。以求最後之成功。特未識航空當局。有無補救之方法否也。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>▲履險如夷的好男子英國有一位履險如夷的好男子。名史厥福喬來。Stratford　Jolly他有一種奇怪的脾氣。不以冒險爲危險。而以冒險爲娛樂的。他不肯老守在本國的三島之上。安坐而食。而獨喜隻身往世界各處荒僻異常没有人迹的地方。作探險的壯舉。越是備嘗艱苦。甚至於無衣無食。他越是興高彩烈。這是近世紀的哥倫布與馬可波羅啊。他自己原是多才多藝。能著書。能雕刻。巴黎沙龍美術館中曾陳列他的作品。他又曾在南非洲做小賣買。靴帶爲生。他又曾在中美洲與南美洲各地搜尋古代孟德查麥和殷卡人遺下的珍物。最近他買了一艘大漁船。打算往西印度羣島去。因爲他相信從前有一個海盜的珍寳。正埋藏在英屬亨杜拉司Honduras島的一座山窟内。他定要發見它。發一筆大横財。一時有三十人聞風投效。願做他的水手。又有三人聞風投效。願做他的水手。又有三十多位好奇的女子。也願跟着他同去。</p>
<h3>梅園秋記</h3>
<p>— 荆夢蝶</p>
<p>辛未自春以來。迄未涉足湖山。病裏愁邊。好景之孤負多矣。昨星期日。居停榮德公見招。同乘汽車往梅園。實今年第一度游也。白雲在天。黄葉滿地。幾處楓林。微見赭色。如病後美人。初試紅妝。園中種菊最多。時已開放。園丁擇其幹高枝繁者。植以大盆。而盤紮其花數十朶。成平圓形。亭亭如蓋。雖出於人工之矯揉。亦足爲花增采。羅列誦豳堂前。吾人於此品茗。不辨茶香與花香也。以外花圃所陳。則尙多含苞未放者。正古人所謂「好花看到半開時」耳。德公顧余。笑間尙有餘勇登絕頂否。余報可。遂相將拾級而上。達山之最高處。則新製球塲在焉。余弱不好弄。曩肄業南菁。從不參加校中運動。以故於球戲實門外漢。而德公轉殷勤指點。於方罫縱横間。球之起訖經過。詳悉靡遺。一若八陣圖中。黄承彦之指引陸遜然。可異亦可愧也。是日天高氣清。一日千里。平湖如鏡。光芒燭天。水上諸山。屏列若畫。遠帆出没烟波。與沙鷗相亂。秋色之佳歎觀止已。旣而游客數人。吟哦而至。則老友伍君受眞在焉。昨自毘陵來也。握手欣然。互道契閙。然君以急於言旋。僅立談數語。留後約而别。下山經宗敬别墅。忽憶故友謝介子。昔年之秋。養疴於此。先後約海上文友浩然西神瘦鵑諸子。觴詠湖山。一時稱盛。余數數周旋其間。樂而亡倦。自介子作古。遂有雲散風流之感。今日重過黄壚。能毋腹痛。旣傷逝者。行自念也。歸途不免興盡悲來已。</p>
<h3>雙十字會緣起</h3>
<p>— 重之</p>
<p>▲救國方法之一</p>
<p>倭奴豺狼成性。此次乘找水災共禍相迫而來之際。出其强盜手段。蹂躙我遼·吉·黑·熱東北四省。利用槍砲飛機炸彈。置吾東北三千萬同胞於亡國奴狀態之下。損失更不知幾千萬萬。嗚呼痛哉。自五三濟案。及最近之萬寳山案。屠殺吾無辜同胞而後。不圖復遭此浩刦。抗日救國。誠當每飯不忘矣。</p>
<p>昔越敗於吳。越王勾踐。臥薪嘗胆。卒雪前恥。雙十字會。顧名思義。取法十年生聚。十年敎訓。抗日救國。决不作五分鐘熱度。保持辛亥年雙十節開國光榮。從今年民國二十年起。繼任二十年間先烈革命精神。努力于取銷不平等條約基本工作。至無所謂國恥而後已。嗚呼國難已至。凡吾同志。見義勇爲。盍興乎來。（籌備處臨時通訊暫由上海郵政信箱九三八號石重之轉。）</p>
<p>▲更正昨日「說部扶輪會」鋅板標題。與「不除庭草齋夫談薈」標題。於拼板時誤排。應對易。又前日睇嚮齋逞𥃤談。施肇基篇中「陳籙」誤「陳錦」。唐紹儀篇中「公卿」誤「公鄕」。「復命所親代奠句。」所親誤不視。末句「見者以爲鄕曲也」。「見者」二字遺漏。合併更正。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（十）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄕下人當然富於好奇心，他就在三等車裏，瞧瞧什麽東西都覺得奇怪的。他也不肯像那位偵探先生一般，伸手躺脚的睡覺。他又聽得人家說：火車裏不能睡覺，因爲火車裏的爬兒手太多了，一個不小心，就被他爬了去，所以他也不敢睡覺。</p>
<p>他見火車裏擠出擠進的，也有一種穿黄色衣服的人。可是那種穿黄色衣服的人，又和車站裏所見的不同了；他們的手臂上，都圍着一種三角式的紅布。鄕下人又猜想到他們一定是那裏去吃喜酒的。他知道從前的帶孝，都帶在頭髮上的，自從剪了辮子以後，有許多人帶孝都帶到手臂上去。什麽手臂上圍了一條黑布，就算是帶孝了。那末照此推想起來，手臂上圍了一條紅布，不是表示喜事，到那裏去吃喜酒嗎？</p>
<p>最奇的，那班手臂圍着紅布的吃喜酒朋，友腰間都掛着一個盒子。這盒子不方不圓，不斜不正，外面還有一綹紅鬚頭，到底是個什麽東西呢？鄕下人想了半天，看它的形式，好像是一個水烟袋的盒子。他想：是了！他們都是吸水烟的。料想喜事人家，没有預備這許多水烟袋，他們所以都自己帶了去。目下的風氣，動不動就是吸香烟，連女人也都啣了一枝香烟在嘴裏。水烟竟無人請敎了。現在還有這一班吃喜酒朋友，都是吸水烟的，連水烟袋都帶在身上，可算是熱心提倡國貨的了。</p>
<p>他要證實他的思想是否正確，他便向坐在他斜對面的一位帶眼鏡先生問道：「他們這個盒子裏，是不是裝了一雙水烟袋？那個水烟袋上的鬚頭，還露出在盒子外面，倒也是現在的新式。」</p>
<p>「是水烟袋嗎？你可要吸一筒水烟？包你吸了這一口水烟以後，永遠不會想吸第二口水烟了。」那位帶眼鏡先生，帶了一副滑稽狡獪的神情，又冷笑了一聲，答覆鄕下人。</p>
<p>「怎麽永遠不會想吸第二口呢？」鄕下人莫名其妙的還要追問，只聽得遠遠地一陣│抵抗抵抗嘸抵抗│不動不動眞不動│的聲音，那火車已經進了站了。</p>
<p>那│抵抗抵抗嘸抵抗│的聲音是什麽？原來是一種吹的軍號的聲音。</p>
<p>那│不動不動眞不動│的聲音是什麽？原來是一種打的軍鼓的聲音。</p>
<h3>故都聞見録</h3>
<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>▲陶然亭</p>
<p>康熙中工部郎中江藻建亭於城南龍樹寺旁。曰陶然。後人因以姓爲號。曰江亭。其他荒烟百頃。坡坨高下。延景實心。有極目江湖之致。每當秋晚。蒹葭蒼蒼。白露爲霜。尤令人忘在帝城之内也。往時冠蓋多集城南。城南衢巷閬塞。塵氛最雜。欲至什刹海等處一覽液池風日。則非竟日之功不可。京朝士大夫苦之。以是亭清曠獨絕而不遠市廛。每有宴游。輒假以治具焉。同光之間。潘文勤張文襄於此大燕公車名士。以彼此皆爲主人。竟互相推諉。未備肴蔽。大貽笑柄。湘綺樓詩集有詩。即詠是日之事。甲午戰事初起。亭畔澤中忽連日有聲如牛。喧傳以爲水怪主兵。其實鵜鶘之屬也。維鵜在梁。恐正足以刺在上位者耳。光緒季年以後。京曹多居内城。江亭之會遂希。民國以後。社壇北海。相繼闢園。簪裾雅集。喜喧惡寂。春明舊事。漸已淡忘。更無人訪此寒烟野水矣。余於辛酉之冬。曾驅車一涉其地。頺然一阜。軒楹欲圯。綱蟲四羃。傭保祈客設一茶。且無肯顧者。蕭然四望。承平游事彷彿猶在目前。亭本以秋勝。故亭旁一墩曰錦秋墩。每歲重九。猶間有好事者假作登高之地。北都人頗重斯節。是日市肆皆賣重陽花糕。糕有二種。其一以糖麵爲之。中夾細果。兩層三層各殊。乃花糕之美者。其一蒸餅之上星星然綴以棗栗。乃其次者也。</p>

<p>▲洋厘銀拆　（洋厘）早市洋厘價格仍無若何變動、爲七錢二分六厘七毫半、午市爲七錢二分六厘六毫二忽半、結果照前日早市改小三毫七忽半、銀拆早市爲二錢二分、午市爲二錢五分、較前日似略小去一分、銀行掛牌九分、劃頭加水五六分、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情江南小洋、緣銷胃疲弱、市價步縮、早午市同爲六錢五分二厘、較前日又跌一厘半、做出交易早市三千角、午市無交易、廣東小洋、早市六錢五分二厘、午市爲六錢五分二厘半、較前日早市似好七毫半、做出交易、早市十五萬角、午市四萬五千角、銅元回長五百文、爲三百七十七千五百文、</p>
<p>▲銀洋進出（銀欵）昨市因星期六、銀行下午例假、收解疏懈、華商收解票欵一百七八十萬、外商收解票欵一百二三十萬、各種貨滙稅雜諸欵收解五百七八十萬、特欵一百餘萬、出倉九十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千三百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百七十餘萬、各路匯欵收解六十餘萬、收現七八十萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵早市做出一百十二萬、午市做出八十萬○五千、鈔票早市無交易、午市三萬、塲外鈔票早市十四萬、午市五萬五千、銀行買買早市互市七十五萬、午市互市六十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百四十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出二百四五十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百九十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百七十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百二十餘萬、客路去胃三十餘萬、小錢莊交易四五十萬、</p>
<h3>證券債價盤旋略漲</h3>
<p>▲二零關統鹽稅約漲一元半</p>
<p>昨（七日）華商證券交易所各債市况、現市甚清、僅編遣於上午開出其他概無交易、期市平平如前、大户仍無鉅額成交、市塲進出零星、陷於盤旋狀態、而無大漲落、但零户乘低收進、頗不寂寞、晨開即一致回漲、如統稅鹽稅二○關等均漲高一元以上、次盤稍稍回疲、惟後市以買方較旺、復行趨堅、惟上落始終平和、結果統稅十一月期漲二元、其十二月期及鹽稅二○關期貨各漲一元四五角、又裁兵十月份亦漲一元二角、其他則僅好四五角左右、債市形勢、仍極沉悶、其趨勢將視外交局勢之發展以爲轉移也、計現貨祗編遣成交二千元、期貨上午五百六十餘萬後市約三百八十九萬、合計九百四十餘萬元、</p>

<h3>棉市跟美棉轉穏</h3>
<p>棉市略平因美棉稍漲、致買方心氣安定、且多數買方以本棉來源缺乏、軋空心思未絶、故拉力甚强、然銀價狂長、對外棉價盤愈廉、所以進口繼長增高、由新永安二廠購進美棉三萬件之巨、本棉以後交易殊爲失望、故照大勢狀况測之、難以穏堅、</p>

<h3>美棉呈參差停滯象</h3>
<p>▲合作社了結期貨購買新棉</p>
<p>六日紐約電告一週間棉市狀况云、本週棉市參差而少活動、現有靜待發展之趨勢、扯平買賣、稍有發生、以待星期一日政府棉産報告之發表糧價與銀價皆堅、故棉價落時有人購進、但棉價漲時則南方售出、而多方亦了結、合作社團積去年所購期貨、以抵其所出之現貨者、現已將其契約變爲實在交易、即了結期貨而在南方購進新棉是也、此舉發生若干壓力、加諸期貨市場、但亦助現貨價值之維持、本週氣候繼續良好、宜於各處之摘棉、私人棉産估計約自一千五百二十五萬包至一千六百七十萬包不等、皆比上月略有增多、但棉産估計之變更、除暫使同業不注意於南方之市價及一般貿易之發展外、有無更大影響、則許多棉商尙有疑念、本週分賣較少、</p>

<h3>糧食洋尖最挺新粳略鬆</h3>
<p>▲商頭昨日市氣甚佳、早晨臨市人數尙多、形勢難以捉摸、新粳到旺軟角許、陳破走銷不振、形居平態、百哥及晚稻貨色有限、本街揀高略取、寗胃雖動極平、市况無榮粤、蘆尖銷雖轉平、乃因貨稀帶挺、洋尖到頭寥市况亦緊、變陰元到積不多、酒户勒價、約短角外、洋米爲金價暴跌、人心虚弱、期現均見少交、市價復短、</p>
<p>▲新閘昨日米市尙未轉暢、因西路市面清淡、本街存貨略有、河貨難以振作、早間開盤尙不過少、去路難以趨好、常蘇白粳短落一角、中關定局、新薄稻及紅稻依然未見回定、杜洋尖次色鬆落近角、標米本街買進不弱、價格站穏、陰化貨滯銷呆、疲去四五角左右、河下斛開三千石譜之、</p>
<h3>回籠洋米喊小一二錢</h3>
<p>昨日洋米期小絞因洋行不抛、人心望好、回籠貨喊高一二錢、惟期西貢有錦隆抛出即裝一號米五百噸、價祗五兩四錢、較小錢許、現貨滯銷多日、昨日貶小一角左右、始行開出五千包左右、小絞與西貢一號各米、西貢一號米十一元六角至十一四角七分、小絞十元零一角至十元零一角七八分、均爲本街辦去云、</p>
<h3>麵粉回跌三分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市又趨疲落之象、以洋麥報價、互有三五角之出入、而人心之衝動、實因金價步小、匯率放長、對於洋麥之合價、又將接近、且東省問題、雖未回復、不過一般喜動之廠家、聞又撥活動、連日向洋麥間訊者、大有人在、因此人心頓盧、又兼小廠抛賣、遠期乃大受打擊、觀察後步、如金市不穏、市氣仍看續疲也、結果本月份較前日跌一分半、十二月份跌一分二厘半、一月份跌二分七厘半、二月份跌二分二厘半、三月份跌二分、四月份跌三分云、</p>
<h3>遠期麥多頭狂出</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均一致呈續跌之象、以洋麥之報價互有漲落、但自金市暴落後、業内外之人心、又爲之變換、良因匯率日長、洋麥仍能抛訂、如是未來之貨量、又不致惶恐、蓋市場之空氣、因全以洋麥能否續定爲轉穏也、近期因廠方尙有需要、尚見穏定、遠期則多漲、大部回出市氣甚軟觀後步尙看續疲也、結果本月份不動、十二月份較前日跌四分、一二月份跌四分、三月份跌五分、四月份跌六分云、</p>
<h3>絲茶紐約期絲市價報漲</h3>
<p>▲期銷發動…近遠期絲價各漲數錢</p>
<p>邇來紐約現絲廠銷雖無起色、而囤户對於期絲進胃轉暢、交易所期絲市價頓趨堅漲、滬白廠經每磅漲美金六七分、遠期漲八九分云、</p>
<h3>南北貨龍口粉隨地價傾跌</h3>
<p>龍口線粉干、近以地價轉鬆、客盤隨降、曾以二十三兩半開出百餘包、現原價各號無進意、有續跌之可能、擴電訊地價已小兩許、此間行盤因亦轉疲、昨市售二十三兩五六錢、苟客盤再弱、則尙須隨跌、以地價形勢觀測、後市尙難站立也</p>
<h3>五金因匯市濫鬆而帶軟</h3>
<p>昨日外匯濫鬆、致五金各市、因之而帶軟、英銅板昨售八兩二錢半（二釐半）、六兩二錢半（半分）、五兩四錢半（七釐半）及五兩二錢半（一分）、均比前跌二錢半、十六號至二十號新鉛絲售十二兩八錢、亦較前小二錢、元釘售八兩四錢、小一錢、白鐡瓦·黄銅絲以及新鐡絲·路皮鐡等均各趨廉、惟實交依然淡薄、所以來市趨勢、均難許樂觀也、</p>
<h3>煤炭大同塊煤售價跟漲</h3>
<p>▲較上週漲五錢</p>
<p>自開平煤篩塊日前因貨缺價漲後、凡烟煤塊各貨價均趨漲、而大同煤塊、亦因存煤大减、盤價更形堅漲、昨日市場售價、每噸已呌至十七兩二錢半、較之上週市價、約漲起五錢云、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>介紹幾本關於日本侵略滿蒙的書（續）</h3>
<p>張非</p>
<p>（二）日本對東三省之鐡路侵略林同濟著華通書局發行</p>
<p>本書是將日本在最近二十餘年來在東省之鐡路經營作一種總合的分析、同時更指出日帝國主義對於東省的經濟政治相互侵略的因果、並特别申說日本「開發滿蒙」的動機、是完全明治「滅亡滿蒙」的别名、昭和「滅亡滿蒙」的最新手段、本書所引述的材料雖然多出自外國書籍、但要研究滿蒙之若何被日帝國主義的蹂躙的青年們、我以爲至少也要讀這本書、</p>
<p>本書計分爲六章五十二節、大概是、</p>
<p>第一章概論│概述國辦鐡路時期、中國戰爭的意義、俄（帝俄）國鐡路的經營、日本勢力之侵入以及它對於滿蒙鐡路經營的狀態、</p>
<p>第二章南滿鐡路會社及其管理之鐡路│本章論述日俄戰後東三省鐡路發展之概觀、滿鐡會社會日本對滿的政策、滿鐡會社組織之政治化及其資本的猛進、鐡路護兵與警察問題及鐡路界及土地之侵佔等、</p>
<p>第三章中日合辦鐡路│論述日本之鐡路借欵政策、大連至上主義及其實行、日本在東北利益範圍之擴張與吉會鐡路問題、日本要求改造吉敦鐡路契約與吉敦路延長問題、吉會路與日本國策及日本建築内蒙大幹路之陰謀等、</p>
<p>第四章日本與中國自辦鐡路│論述中國在東三省鐡路經營之舛運、新法鐡路問題與日本之破壞、中國自辦鐡路之復興等、</p>
<p>第五章日本與中東鐡路│論述西比利亞出兵問題與日本謀奪中東路之各面觀、中東南滿兩路之競爭、分路北迫之日本政策等、</p>
<p>第六章日本侵略東三省之總觀察│總述日本在東三省之鐡路經營與其滿蒙政策之關係、日本「開發」東省之大計劃、日本侵略東省各機關之統一化及日本在滿蒙之特殊利益等、</p>
<p>本書與上書不同之點、主要是在於多横的論列而少縱的分晰、我以爲研究某一問題、最好先從縱後及横、史的明白可以資助綜合的或個别的事物的理解、可以確定理論的根據、故這本書所以必在讀了上書之後而讀、其原因就是如此、</p>
<p>（三）日本勢力下二十年來之滿蒙</p>
<p>陳經編上海華通書局</p>
<p>本書是比較的用科學的方法、將二十年來日本帝國主義向滿蒙殖民的性質·人數·方法·地方爲研究的對象、即是以日本對滿蒙的殖民政策爲研究的對象同時更將日本在滿蒙的政治·經濟·交通·文化以及由日本殖民政策的運用的結果、即滿蒙被日本壓迫侵略的各方面形態、爲本書論述的内容、本書的特點是在將各時期各地方的數字統計、羅列甚詳、而尤以其對於日本在滿蒙侵略的背景與現狀的分晰、爲他盡所不及、例如它的序言說、</p>
<p>「爲了喚起民衆、對於日本在滿蒙二十年來的根深蒂固的殖民政策、應該有相當的分析、如日本在滿蒙的殖民是多少數目、他採用何種方法以解决他的殖民生活、以及日本對於朝鮮的移民政策是怎樣、這些朝鮮人的人數是若干、其程度與性質性是怎樣、他們移殖在什麽地方、日本對此採用何種方計、他如何强制他們、如何利用他們、如何剥削他們、其次日本對於滿蒙在政治上是如何壓迫、在經濟上是如何掠奪│他怎樣投資、怎樣掠取原料與勞動力、怎樣販賣他的剩餘商品、怎樣摧取利潤與貨弊│怎樣在交通事業上從事壟斷、怎樣在文化事業上從事侵略、最後要發展牠的殖民政策到如何程度、凡此等等、都要加以加以相當的分析、」</p>
<p>這樣就可見出這一本大概的内容、當此究究滿蒙問題中有一讀的必要了、本書分爲總論、各論與餘論定編、計…</p>
<p>總論日本殖民滿蒙的概况</p>
<p>第一章日本人口急增與其滿蒙殖民之關係、</p>
<p>第二章日本整個的殖民政策與其滿蒙殖民政策之關係、</p>
<p>各論日本對於滿蒙的殖民政策之機能、</p>
<p>第一章政治侵略的不平等條約之作用、</p>
<p>第一編經濟侵略的機能│（不均衡的輸出之作用）</p>
<p>第一章對於原料的掠取、</p>
<p>第二章對於商工業的投資、</p>
<p>第三章對於交通的佔據、</p>
<p>第四章對於文化的侵略、</p>
<p>餘論對於上面各論的總結及滿蒙前途的論述、</p>
<p>以上三書、雖多係立論綫顯、然青年們如果能從第一本以下讀起、則至少對於日本侵略蒙滿問題、必可得到一個深刻的印象、我們知道田中義一之積極政策、嘗謂「要滅支那必先滅滿蒙」、可知我們要研究日本對華侵略之政策與現狀、亦必先從他們所施于滿蒙的政策及歷史以至現在的狀態研究起、上舉三書、雖是在研究這一問題的内容上看起來、非常的不充分、但在我個人看起來、總是不失爲比較可讀入門書的、因此、特爲介紹、</p>

<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Troops Repel Japanese Army, Briand Applies to Chinese and Japanese Governments to Maintain Peace, League of Nations' Japanese Representative Opposes Convening Executive Council in Paris, Black Army Recovers Jiangqiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday Morning Continued Fierce Battles, Ma Zhanshan's Troops Counterattacked, Destroying One Japanese Aircraft, Japanese Army Suffered Numerous Casualties</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today, the battle on the Tao'ang Road is still fierce. The Japanese army's Changchun Nagatani Brigade and Jilin Amano Brigade moved to the front line on the night of the 6th, joining the battle. The battle line now stretches over ten li, from Xinlitun in the east to Daguantun in the west. The area is a flat plain, making it very difficult for our troops to defend. Today, from dawn onwards, they have been constantly harassing us with cavalry and artillery in shifts. The number of aircraft has increased to over twenty, bombing back and forth. Our cavalry is unable to maintain a firm front due to the harassment and has been replaced by Fan Brigade's infantry to hold the front, changing from offense to defense. The situation has now improved. On the 6th, our troops surrounded the enemy for two hours. The enemy's dead were piled up. At 4 PM, using handheld machine guns as the vanguard and artillery cover, they broke through and retreated in defeat. At 12 AM on the 6th, the Japanese army used hand grenades as offensive weapons. Soldiers with fixed bayonets charged at us fiercely. Our troops mostly lacked bayonets and used gun stocks to resist the enemy. After about half an hour of hand-to-hand combat, they repelled the enemy. Our troops suffered many casualties. Due to the lack of field hospitals, they are all being accommodated at Daxing Railway Station, exposed on the platform, which is very miserable. Su Bingwen Brigade's composite regiment is now moving to the front to provide support. Japanese troops captured our troops and dismembered them to death. (Special dispatch at 4:10 PM on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Two battalions of infantry from the 20th Brigade of the Jilin Army are now moving to the Harbin-Manzhouli line to protect the railway on behalf of the Black Army.

Our troops won a great victory, killing over six hundred enemies. Their bodies were scattered everywhere. The enemy retreated fifty li, fleeing across the river. Our troops continued to take advantage of the victory to recover Jiangqiao, our first line of defense. In today's fierce battle, our First Brigade destroyed one Japanese aircraft with flat-trajectory guns. Merchants and civilians in Heilongjiang Province rushed to make noodles and loaded them onto trucks, transporting them to the front to send to the soldiers. Ma Zhanshan went to the front this afternoon to comfort the troops. Our troops are using Hongqiyingzi and Sanjiantun as the second line of defense, deploying heavy troops.

<p>(Harbin) At 3 AM on the 6th, the Japanese army transferred over a thousand troops from the Sipingjie-Taonan Road and linked up with Zhang Hai Peng's six thousand troops, launching a fierce attack on the Black Army at Jiangqiao again. Armored cars fired one shell every three minutes, and aircraft dropped heavy bombs in the sky. After 4 AM, their workers, under the cover of artillery fire, built a pontoon bridge. A large force of infantry rushed across to the north of the bridge. Our troops, due to the shifting of their positions, retreated to Daxing Station. Around 10 AM, Brigade Commander Wu Songshan personally commanded the counterattack along with the newly formed First Brigade from two directions, surrounding the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties. Japanese aircraft came to bomb to relieve the siege. Our troops were not afraid and continued to encircle and attack. The rails between Tao'ang Road, Jiangqiao, and Daxing Station were destroyed by our troops during the retreat. The Japanese army is rushing to repair them. Cannon fire has already been heard in the Ang'angxi area today. One regiment of the Black Army's Su Bingwen Brigade crossed Ang'angxi this afternoon to go to the front to reinforce. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

Today, most of the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on our troops. Seven Japanese aircraft dropped bombs back and forth on our defense area. Eighteen mountain cannons have fierce firepower. Our troops are passively under pressure. The Japanese army despises justice and disregards everything. We are in legitimate self-defense and should do our best to resist. The fighting is still fierce. I hope you will convey the above situation to the consuls of all countries. Ma Zhanshan, Weihai seal. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

(Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) This morning, the Japanese army, under the cover of two aircraft, used over fifty ferries to coordinate a fierce attack with the large Japanese army on the pontoon bridge. Zhang Hai Peng's army simultaneously coordinated from the west of Jiangqiao by boat. We fought valiantly to meet them, but in the end, we were attacked from three sides, so we changed our strategy, dismantled the railway tracks, and retreated to Daxing Station, deploying cavalry in front and on both flanks to cover the infantry's counterattack. Wu Songshan personally led the front, and the shouts of killing shook the fields. Zhang Hai Peng's rebel troops were the first to collapse and flee. Countless Japanese soldiers were annihilated. A part of Zhang's rebel troops has surrendered. The Japanese are still stubbornly resisting with aircraft cover. In this afternoon's battle, Japanese aircraft dropped hundred-pound high-explosive bombs. Six aircraft bombed back and forth. Our troops suffered extremely heavy casualties. The buildings at Daxing Station were all destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese authorities in Shenyang issued a statement saying that the battle at Nenjiang continued non-stop all day on Friday. This morning, two Japanese regiments had arrived at Jiangqiao from Changchun. On Thursday night, about one hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. On Friday night, the Chinese troops retreated northward. The Japanese troops occupied Daxing Railway Station on the north bank. Among the Chinese troops, there were Russians wearing Chinese military uniforms. Japanese officials also released another event, saying that Japanese soldiers clashed with bandits in Anshan, southeast of Shenyang, and two Japanese soldiers were wounded. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The battle at Nenjiang Bridge has now stopped, at least temporarily, because the troops under Ma Zhanshan have completely collapsed and retreated towards Ang'angxi. The battle was quite fierce. 150 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. According to the Ministry of the Army, the Japanese soldiers have been ordered not to cross Tangxi (transliteration), which is twelve kilometers from north of Jiang. After the Japanese soldiers occupied Daxing north of Jiang, they did not pursue the Chinese soldiers retreating towards Ang'angxi. Before the outcome of the battle was clear, in addition to the two regiments that had been dispatched, they were transferred from Changchun to the front yesterday morning and hastily boarded the train, but now they received a report that the Chinese soldiers had retreated, so they returned to Changchun. But as soon as the news of the cessation of hostilities arrived, a disturbing report had spread from Harbin to Tokyo. The Japanese Consul in Harbin reported that the American Consul in Harbin had received news from Manzhouli that the Chinese soldiers in Harbin and Hailar were now advancing towards Ang'angxi, fearing that this action was in preparation for a counterattack. This report has not yet been confirmed, but the actual situation has already aroused vigilance. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A report from Manchuria received here said that the body of a Russian officer was found among the corpses of Chinese soldiers in the Nenjiang battlefield. It is generally believed that this was a Soviet Russian. 36 Japanese soldiers were killed and 144 were wounded, including seven officers and two aviation officers. In addition, three aircraft were destroyed by machine guns. More than 200 Chinese soldiers were killed. According to news from Harbin, a Chinese regiment commander was killed, as well as two other officers and forty-six lower-ranking officers. Ma Zhanshan's troops are now concentrated between Ang'angxi and Daxing. Food and ammunition are now being transported there. This statement seems to confirm the report issued by the Japanese consulate that new Chinese troops may launch a counterattack. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Shenyang, Ma Zhanshan's troops have retreated. Japanese engineers have begun to repair the bridge. The main Japanese force is now stationed at Daxing Station north of Jiang to protect it. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that Ma Zhanshan's troops have now retreated far from Nenjiang. The Japanese army has again been ordered not to advance beyond twelve kilometers from the Jiang. It is also heard that the Japanese army does not want to invade the area of the Chinese Eastern Railway to prevent causing disputes with the Soviet Russian authorities.

<h3>Briand Sent Notes to China and Japan Urging Both Sides to Maintain Peace</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Briand today sent notes to the Chinese and Japanese governments, urging both sides to maintain peace. The wording was very forceful, stating that the unfortunate expansion of events to Northern Manchuria is a serious matter. According to the reports provided by the Chinese and Japanese governments regarding such events, it cannot but increase the anxiety of the League of Nations Council and world opinion. As the Chairman of the Council, I ask the representatives of China and Japan to recall that they had previously assured the Council that their respective governments would take the necessary steps to prevent the situation from becoming more serious. The Council had recorded this solemn promise in the resolution of September 30. Now, in fulfilling the promise, it seems that the two governments must immediately instruct their respective commanders to eliminate all possibilities of clashes and bloodshed between Chinese and Japanese troops. If more serious accidents occur, it will make it more difficult for the Council to strive to maintain peace and reconcile disputes, etc. (National News Agency telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Chicago Tribune in Paris published that the League of Nations Council was originally scheduled to meet on November 16. Now, because the situation in the three eastern provinces has suddenly become more severe, and there is a risk of a breakdown in international relations, it is said that it will be moved earlier to the 13th. Briand is preparing to convene the meeting earlier at any time and suggests that the most appropriate day is the coming Friday. (League of Nations telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the French Foreign Ministry denied that the League of Nations Council would convene earlier than November 16, and stated that Briand had already separately asked China and Japan to maintain peace to avoid increasing the difficulty of reconciliation. The content of the two telegrams was worded the same. In addition, Briand also sent a special note to the Japanese government, the content of which has not yet been released. (National News Agency telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The United States Advises Japan to Withdraw Troops, Diplomatic Action Independent, Not Coordinated with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Stimson issued a statement today when the US Ambassador to Japan advised Japan to adjust the Sino-Japanese dispute and withdraw its troops to the South Manchurian Railway's affiliated territories, stating that the US policy on the Liaoning-Jilin incident has not changed and continues to act independently in the diplomatic field. It judges every event and action in the case completely independently but is always prepared to cooperate with other countries dedicated to maintaining peace in the three eastern provinces. The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, went to the State Department today to assure the US authorities that Japan would withdraw its troops along the Nenjiang River as soon as the railway bridge was repaired. If Japanese engineers could work according to the scheduled procedure, the traffic on the Tao'ang Railway could be fully restored within a week or ten days. As for the fact that US Ambassador to Japan, Forbes, advised Shidehara, the initial intention was to keep it secret, so it was an informal action. However, it is now believed here that Forbes left a letter recording the US intention. Moreover, according to the Associated Press, the letter Forbes gave to Shidehara frankly expressed the US's concerns about the Liaoning-Jilin incident and its desire that the dispute between the two sides be adjusted. However, it is heard that Stimson did not authorize Forbes to notify the Japanese government that the United States would join the League of Nations in requesting the Japanese army to withdraw completely before November 16.

<h3>Japan Bears Responsibility for Starting the Nenjiang War, Shi Zhaoji Reports the Truth to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Dr. Shi Zhaoji, with a worried expression, visited the League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond and told him about the serious situation caused by the Sino-Japanese war in Nenjiang and handed over a statement that the League of Nations, if it wanted to avoid a very serious dispute, needed to stop it quickly. When the Sino-Japanese war at Nenjiang Bridge was underway, there was also the same intense struggle in Geneva. Both China and Japan each submitted documents on the current situation to the League of Nations Secretariat. The Secretariat has now released the original text of a report by Dr. Shi, which stated that after receiving a notification from the Japanese military authorities, the Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, in accordance with the Chinese government's policy and its promise not to escalate the situation in Manchuria, withdrew all Chinese troops from Nenjiang Bridge. However, on the morning of November 4, Japanese troops crossed the bridge to a place outside the north bank and arrested three Chinese soldiers. The Chinese soldiers did not resist at all. Over a hundred Japanese soldiers opened fire and bombarded the Chinese soldiers, injuring dozens of them. For the sake of self-defense, the Chinese soldiers were forced to open fire and fought with several hundred Japanese soldiers until dusk. The number of Japanese soldiers continued to increase. The League of Nations should urgently stop it to avoid more serious disputes. The telegram from Shenyang received by the Japanese delegation was also released at the same time. According to the Japanese, the dispatch of Japanese troops to Nenjiang was for the purpose of repairing the bridge. The commander of the Kwantung Japanese Army had received instructions to withdraw as soon as the bridge was repaired. The telegram detailed the events of November 2 and 4, saying that Chinese soldiers bombarded Japanese soldiers holding the Japanese flag on the 4th, killing fifteen people. It is heard that the League of Nations Secretariat will now release a memorandum from the Japanese government recently explaining the situation of the Nenjiang war. (Reuters telegram on the 6th)</p>

<h3>The League of Nations Intends to Study Recalling Ambassadors to Japan, Japan's Withdrawal of Salt Tax Affects Foreign Debt Guarantee, Relevant Countries Jointly Plan to Sanction Violent Japan</h3>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations today stated that the Council, after reopening on the</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>16th, will study the possibility of asking major countries to recall their ambassadors to Japan in order to exert the greatest pressure on the Japanese warlords. At that time, the issue of Japan's withdrawal of salt taxes will also be resolved. The countries concerned are currently discussing this because Japan's withdrawal of salt taxes will affect the principal and interest of 12.5 million pounds of foreign debt. Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa today sent a letter to the League of Nations Secretariat in response to China's recent note to the League of Nations, stating that the Japanese army is gradually withdrawing. At this time, there are no more than 1,000 people outside the affiliated territories of the railway, including the two detachments protecting and repairing the Nenjiang Bridge. The Japanese army also hopes that the situation along the Tao'ang Road can be stabilized as soon as possible. As for the Japanese troops in Jilin and the Juliuhe area, half of them have been withdrawn. It is also said that the Chinese authorities in Heilongjiang Province refused to repair the Nenjiang Bridge and opened fire, killing 19 Japanese soldiers. The Tao'ang Road is an important route for transporting soybeans and other grains to southern Manchuria, so the Nenjiang Bridge must be repaired before it freezes. In addition, it denied that Japan withheld half of the salt tax in Niuzhuang. (National News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Japanese officials denied the Chinese representative in Geneva's claim that the Japanese had forcibly taken salt taxes in Manchuria, saying that what the Japanese authorities did was to prevent Beijing or Nanjing from withdrawing salt taxes from Manchuria. This fund will be used for Manchurian administrative expenses. It is also said that the Japanese army has never supplied arms to the independence army, and the Japanese have nothing to do with the Mongols who attacked Tongliao. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Reply to Briand Expresses the Minimum Limit Acceptable</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's reply to Briand has been sent to Europe and will probably be announced simultaneously tonight in Tokyo, London, Paris, Geneva, and Shanghai. The content is currently unknown, but it is heard that the reply expresses the minimum limit acceptable to Japan. Although the content of the US letter is still kept secret, the US officialdom here has expressed a concise criticism of the attitude of the letter, saying: "Good medicine tastes bitter." (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Japanese Embassy in Paris announced that the Japanese government's reply to Briand's recent letter will arrive in France soon. (National News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>The British Newspaper Deeply Regrets the Japanese Military's Free Actions</h3>
<p>(London) The Times newspaper today made pessimistic remarks on the Sino-Japanese conflict in its editorial, saying that the development of the Manchurian incident is becoming increasingly serious. It is useless to say that there is still a reasonable hope of resolving it before November 16. Japan pointed out that China had more than 300 acts of infringing on treaty rights and 400 cases of bandits hindering the Japanese railway. Japan was originally in the right, but it is regrettable that the leaders of the Japanese army in Manchuria are strongly holding their government's hands. But on the Chinese side, we must say that China has recently made great efforts to restore order in Manchuria. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Telegraphs the Situation of Japanese Military Aggression</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's circular telegram said: All newspapers in the country are aware that the Northeast Incident has gone through two resolutions of the League of Nations, setting a deadline for Japan to withdraw its troops. Although the Japanese soldiers still argued strongly, they also declared that they would not expand the situation further. Unexpectedly, judging from the facts, the opposite is true. Now, I will briefly describe the summary of the Japanese military's atrocities after the League of Nations resolution on the 24th of last month: (1) Between the 31st of last month and the 1st of this month, a Japanese armored train and two troop trains opened into the territory of Tongliao from Zhengjiatun and frequently attacked the county seat with intense artillery fire, and a large number of Mongolian bandits, under the cover of the Japanese army, followed forward. By the morning of the 2nd, the artillery fire was still incessant, and the railway had been repaired. The armored train advanced to Tongliao North Station, occupied the station, and hung the Japanese flag near the station and about three li from Xiaojie E. Digging trenches and deploying troops, actively attacking. The junction of the Tongliao North and South Stations was also mined by the Japanese army. On the morning of the 3rd, it attacked the South Station again. At noon, a total of two Japanese armored trains arrived at the North Station. They dismantled the Taocha from the Tongliao to Kaiyu railway. The intention of the Japanese army's atrocities in Tongliao this time is obviously to help the Mongolian bandits and create internal chaos in order to create an excuse for the future. (2) The Japanese army lured and coerced Zhang Haipeng, the garrison commander of Taonan, to plot chaos in Jiang Province, but his cunning schemes are still not small. On the pretext that the Tao'ang Road has a loan relationship, he requested that the Tailai Jiang Bridge be repaired by him. After our side replied that it should be repaired by the Railway Bureau, he ignored it, advanced to Jiangqiao, insisted on repairing it forcibly, and even requested to occupy Daxing. Six troop trains had been opened to Jiangqiao for several days. From 2 PM on the 4th, the Japanese army changed into Chinese costumes and mixed with bandits to cross the river and began shooting at our military positions. From Chen to Hai on the 5th, a part of the Japanese army covered most of Zhang Haipeng's army and launched a fierce attack on us. In addition, seven Japanese aircraft dropped hundreds of bombs on our positions. The firepower of the eighteen mountain cannons was particularly heavy. Our casualties were quite numerous. On the morning of the 6th, Major Hayashi Hideyoshi, the representative of the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army, publicly demanded that the chairmanship of Jiang Province be ceded to Zhang Haipeng and a maintenance association be organized before the Japanese army could stop attacking. The attitude was extremely strong. The Japanese army is still continuing to increase a large number of troops. Our situation is very urgent. We are now trying our best to defend ourselves and find ways to defend ourselves. In addition to reporting to the Central Government and reporting to the League of Nations at any time, requesting a way to stop it, and properly instructing all departments to take appropriate self-defense measures, I am sending this telegram to inform you, and I respectfully ask you to give me clear instructions. Your brother Zhang Xueliang, Yu Hai Mi.</p>
<h3>A Japanese National Convention Will Be Held in Tokyo Today</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to express the public opinion of the Japanese people on the situation in Manchuria, a national convention will be held in Tokyo tomorrow. The initiators are various public organizations related to Sino-Japanese relations and overseas affairs. Current motions will be submitted to the convention, and if passed, they will be sent to all parts of the world so that the world can know the feelings of the Japanese towards the Manchurian incident. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The South Manchurian Railway Transports Troops, an Accident Occurred, Shenyang Forbids People to Watch</h3>
<p>The South Manchurian Railway in Xinminfu refused to load passengers and cargo yesterday. The Chinese believe that this is because of the transportation of troops. Shenyang Railway Station is now heavily guarded. At night, trains passing through the border are forbidden to be watched. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The US State Department Has Not Yet Expressed Its Opinion on Rong Kui's Request</h3>
<p>(Washington) After detailed news of the outbreak of the Nenjiang Bridge war continued to arrive here today, the general public's concern about Japan's actions in Manchuria increased. Observers of the situation stated that the question of whether Japan can comply with the Kellogg-Briand Pact has clearly approached a crisis situation. If the Sino-Japanese war in Manchuria does not stop, the value of the pact in preventing war will be seriously tested. The news of the Jiangqiao war in the past three days has been very contradictory, so the truth is still not very clear here, but there is undoubtedly a real war. As for the fact that Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Rong Kui made an oral request to the State Department yesterday to maintain the integrity of the Nine-Power Treaty, the State Department has not yet expressed its opinion on this. Although the Nine-Power Treaty has been mentioned frequently recently, it is still awaiting a formal complaint. (National News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>The Executive Council Is Convened in Paris, the Japanese Representative Holds Dissenting Opinions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Briand suggested that the meeting of the Executive Council on November 16 should be held in Paris. All members agreed. According to the Chinese delegation here, the Japanese military commander requested that the chairman of Heilongjiang, Ma Zhanshan, resign and be succeeded by Zhang Haipeng. The Japanese army is still cooperating with Zhang Haipeng's army. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the League of Nations Executive Council has decided to meet in Paris on November 16, it is heard that several representatives have raised objections to this, especially the Japanese representative. The reason he holds is that there are many foreign students in Paris, and he fears that those people will exert a disruptive influence on the discussions of the Executive Council. (Reuters telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Threaten Puyi with Bombs as Gifts</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At around 5 PM on the 6th, someone delivered four gifts to Puyi's residence. A bomb was found in the fruit basket, but fortunately, it did not explode. The Japanese police station is investigating the source. It is known that it was sent by a Chinese hotel. A telegram was urgently sent to the French Concession Public Works Bureau to send detectives to the Chinese hotel to arrest the suspect, but he had already flown away. According to the hotel accountant, today a middle-aged traveler, claiming to be surnamed Zhao, with a round face and no beard, came from Beiping. At 3 PM, he accompanied the room attendant to the Hanggongqiu to buy two baskets of fresh fruit and two tubes of Zhengxingde tea leaves. At 4 PM, he returned to the residence. At 5 PM, he ordered the room attendant to send them to Puyi's residence, instructing him to return immediately after delivering them. After the room attendant took the gifts, Zhao settled the room bill and left. After the incident, the room attendant was detained and questioned, but nothing was found out. This matter is closely related to the independence and restoration movement in Manchuria and Mongolia. The Japanese advised Puyi to go to Liaoning to organize an independent country, but Puyi did not agree. Now they sent a bomb, intending to intimidate him. If he does not go again, his life may be in danger. Japanese and French detectives are investigating everywhere. As of the evening of the 7th, nothing has been gained.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Authenticity of the Tanaka Memorial</h3>
<p>In July 1927, the Tanaka Giichi cabinet of Japan planned a highly aggressive invasion of our Northeastern Four Provinces, endangering the world with an extremely cruel memorial. Heaven provided the opportunity for our nation to discover it, enabling us to ruthlessly expose this conspiracy to the entire world as a serious warning.</p>
<p>Japan, facing the exposure of this extremely vicious and arrogant conspiracy, felt "the guilt of a thief." Naturally, they immediately sensed extraordinary panic. However, verbally, they had to resort to all sorts of sophistry and denial. Of course, "denying responsibility" is a common tactic of Japanese politicians and military leaders. Faced with this unexpected blow, besides using sophistry and denial to attempt to deceive the world, there was no other way. However, can the Japanese truly cover the eyes and ears of the world with one hand?</p>
<p>All countries in the world have now deeply felt the threat of the Tanaka conspiracy with the outbreak of the current Northeast Incident. Newspapers in the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries have all disclosed the original text of the memorial. The Japanese were even more shocked by this. The Foreign Ministry specially issued a denial, stating that the memorial was a forgery, and claiming that "this document is obviously a forgery and cannot deceive anyone." Public opinion in various countries, confused by the strong defense of the Japanese, and lacking reliable evidence, sent many telegrams to inquire about the truth of the matter and how the memorial was obtained. The world has now paid attention to this, which we cannot but regard as a welcome phenomenon for the future of world peace.</p>
<p>We hereby solemnly announce to all countries in the world that, to determine whether the Tanaka Memorial is genuine or fake, one should analyze and understand it from the pile of facts of Japan's established actions in recent years. Because facts speak louder than words, the Japanese themselves are the fair judges of the authenticity of the Tanaka Memorial. As for how this memorial was obtained, all countries in the world do not need to inquire about the details. Obtaining secret documents that are deeply related to one's own country by some means is not without precedent in the world. The world only needs to recognize the serious nature of this secret document. We believe that it is not necessary to explore how it was obtained.</p>
<p>The plans decided by the Eastern Conference held in Tokyo at the Foreign Minister's official residence, chaired by Tanaka on June 27, 1927, and the Lushun Conference held on August 15 of the same year, should not have been forgotten by people around the world. At that time, various groups affiliated with the Seiyukai in Japan held a national assembly to protect the motherland in Shiba Park, and airplanes distributed leaflets saying, "The key to solving the population problem lies only in the aggressive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia. If the parliament opposes it, it should be dissolved immediately." Why were the Eastern Conference and the Lushun Conference convened? What did the Eastern Conference and the Lushun Conference decide? Why did the Seiyukai have such fervent support for the aggressive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia? These irrefutable facts are most worthy of retrospect. In other words, these facts have an inseparable cause-and-effect relationship with the Tanaka Memorial produced in July of that year. The slightest clues in between are enough for us to understand and grasp the absolute truth of the Tanaka Memorial and that it is not a forgery.</p>
<p>Secondly, let us point out the ironclad evidence of the Tanaka conspiracy based on the actions of the Japanese in the past two years. For example, Tanaka said, "At this time, our competition with the United States is an unavoidable duty." Today, the Japanese government and public unanimously regard the US government as their imaginary enemy. Newspapers openly promote this without any concealment. As stated in the memorial, "The policy of encouraging and protecting Korean immigrants" has resulted in more than one million Koreans residing in our Northeast, and the Wanbaoshan Incident and the incitement of Korean hatred towards the Chinese have occurred. As stated in the memorial, "The aggressive policy towards Inner and Outer Mongolia" is now being actively carried out with the incitement of the Japanese in the Mongolian independence movement. As mentioned in the memorial, "The development of the New World and the aggressive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia," the Jihui Railway is now being forcibly laid under armed protection. All other railways have been gradually realized over the years according to their original plans. As stated in the memorial, "Following the intention of Ito and Katsura to merge Korea, a Colonial Ministry should be established to specifically manage the affairs of Manchuria and Mongolia." Now, the Colonial Ministry has been established, and there is a call for "Korea and Manchuria as one." As stated in the memorial, "When there is an opportunity, we will negotiate with the Chinese government to solve the problem of opening up the Jihai branch line." Today, the Japanese opposition to the construction of parallel lines to the South Manchurian Railway is loud and clear. As stated in the memorial, "Japan, in order to protect itself and others, must use iron and blood to remove the difficulties in East Asia." Today, the Japanese have suddenly launched an undeclared war and forcibly occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Judging from the past and recent actions of the Japanese, the conspiracy in the Tanaka Memorial is in perfect agreement. The Japanese are diligently implementing Tanaka's plan, but on the other hand, they flatly deny the authenticity of the memorial. "Who is deceiving whom?" From these mutually corroborating facts, people around the world should be able to recognize and grasp the truth of the Tanaka Memorial.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the disclosure of this memorial was two years ago, not after the outbreak of the Northeast Incident. The Japanese Foreign Ministry only officially denied it today. Their guilt can be seen in general. The memorial planned all aspects extremely carefully, and it corresponds exactly to Japan's continental policy for establishing the country. In particular, it involves many secret diplomatic relations with various countries. A review will further prove that it is by no means a forgery.</p>
<p>We deeply feel the threat of this conspiracy, and the world should also deeply feel the threat of this conspiracy. China has already exposed this conspiracy that endangers the world. How should the world give it close attention and effectively restrain it? All countries in the world should know how to plan for themselves. Finally, we dare to solemnly declare that the Tanaka Memorial is a bomb that can destroy the world and destroy humanity. People who love peace in the world should not neglect it.</p>

<h3>German Newspaper Admonishes Japan to Avert Disaster</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The recent development of the situation in the three northeastern provinces has caused a significant change in the tone of German newspapers. In the past, due to domestic turmoil and strict neutrality, there was a detached attitude. Now, there is deep concern that a Sino-Japanese war is imminent, and even Soviet Russia and the whole world may be drawn in. The attitude has changed from before, and news from the Far East has put other news aside from the cover. The comments also severely criticize Japan's non-compliance with the League of Nations Council resolutions, advocating the use of tough measures to force Japan to abandon its stubborn attitude, saying that at first, Japan seemed to want to use this move to win the most favorable conditions, but now Japan's intention to not withdraw troops is becoming increasingly apparent. The Japanese army violated Ambassador Yoshizawa's guarantee in Geneva and entered Chinese territory for no obvious reason, occupying Chinese railways and reaching within the scope of Russian interests. There is no doubt that the Japanese want to provoke Soviet Russia. Judging from Japan's claim that Russian border military actions and Russian secret assistance to the Chinese army contain political effects and are not credible. Finally, it also stated that it hopes that Japan will avert disaster and abandon its policy of achieving military goals, so as not to arouse the public anger of the entire civilized world.

<h3>Japan's Future Actions: Capitulation, Alignment with Russia, or Active War Preparation?</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although Japan has repeatedly stated that it will withdraw its troops from the Nenjiang Bridge as soon as it is repaired, it is now heard that a detachment may have to be temporarily stationed in the railway area, because the current season is the harvest season for soybeans and other items, and transportation requires protection. Newspapers still carry stories of Soviet Russia secretly assisting China, but most Japanese do not believe that Soviet Russia will start a war against Japan, and some even believe that the main cause of fear now is not Soviet Russia's assistance to China, but the League of Nations. If the League of Nations attempts to impose "economic sanctions" on Japan, then Japan may sign a treaty with Soviet Russia and occupy key areas in China in order to guarantee the source of military supplies and resist the League of Nations. This proposal seems unreasonable. Observers of the current situation mostly expect the League of Nations to avoid taking this harsh plan. Only the general conservatives advocate this proposal. The Japanese people regard the resolutions of the League of Nations</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The case is an unfair pressure on Japan, which is very angry, so the whole country has a tendency to be conservative. The Japanese believe that if the League of Nations implements Article 16 of the League of Nations Charter again, Japan will choose one of two ways, either completely capitulate or take the actions advocated by extreme nationalists, but the first way is never in the imagination.

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Admonition to Students of Central University</h3>
<p>Obey Orders and Pay Attention to Discipline</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang gave an admonition to the students of Central University at the gymnasium of Central University on the afternoon of the 7th, saying that Central University is the highest institution of learning in the country, and the actions of the students are sufficient to affect the whole country. Therefore, in our patriotic movement this time, (1) military training must understand the three requirements of soldiers: 1. Tidy military uniforms, 2. Fierce military equipment, 3. Strict military discipline. In the past, "good men do not become soldiers, good iron does not make nails." Now we want to say that bad men do not become soldiers, and being a soldier is the most glorious thing. (2) In national salvation work, we must first understand why a small country like Japan can invade our three northeastern provinces, and why Russia was able to successfully carry out a revolution in the shortest period of time, and Japan dared not bully it. It is because the people in their countries listen to the command of the country. I hope that you will receive military training, obey the orders of the instructors, and create a disciplined and energetic volunteer army. (Seventh Special Telegram)</p>

Initially, it was unknown that John Simon would suddenly be appointed to the diplomatic mission. John Simon is a well-known lawyer with no deep connection to the diplomatic world, and outsiders do not know what kind of deep observations he has on the world situation that can enable him to deal with various complex international issues such as the German reparations issue, etc. In short, French public opinion is quite surprised by John Simon's leap from a Liberal figure to an important figure in the diplomatic world, and is still very satisfied with the fact that moderate figures occupy the majority in the new British cabinet.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Consular Jurisdiction Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 6th - Reuters learned from reliable sources tonight that negotiations on Britain's abolition of consular jurisdiction in China will be suspended until the Sino-Japanese conflict in Manchuria is over. These negotiations have been stalled for a long time. Without guarantees to protect British interests in China, Britain will not give up consular jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Romanian Government Confers General Title on Piłsudski</h3>
<p>▲ Guomin, Moscow, 6th - Recently, Polish dictator General Piłsudski traveled to Romania. In Bucharest, the Romanian government conferred the title of General. Soviet Russian newspapers have criticized Romania's conferring the highest military honor on the Polish political leader. Pravda newspaper said that Romania's willingness to grant Piłsudski the supreme title must be because Piłsudski has made supreme contributions to Romania, and that contribution must be more than the re-signing of the Baltic military agreement, but must have something even more important. After Piłsudski's visit to Bucharest, the Romanian army was completely reorganized, and a special expert group was formed. Afterwards, the manufacturing and testing of all military supplies imported into Romania, both domestically and from abroad, must be supervised by the group before they can be implemented. From this point of view, it can be seen that the two Baltic countries have not forgotten their previous attempts to oppose the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Bar Silver Falls Back Three-One-Two-Five</h3>
<p>▲ Guomin, London, 7th - London silver market closed lower today, with spot at 20 pence, yesterday it was 20 pence three-one-two-five, and forward at 19 pence eight-seven-five, yesterday it was 20 pence one-eight-seven-five, so both spot and forward fell three-one-two-five.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>The Alumni Association of Beiyang University telegrams all newspapers: Our school's Acting President Wang Jianlu has been distressed and fasting for four days and nights because of the deadlock in the peace conference and the lack of effective resistance against foreign aggression. Although colleagues and others have repeatedly advised him, and have received letters and telegrams of comfort from all parties, he still shows no sign of resuming eating. I believe that when national disasters are imminent and worries are intertwined, peaceful reunification is the only urgent task at present, which is the prayer of the whole country. The life and death of the nation depends on the success or failure of the peace conference. Acting President Wang's telegram to the East has been disclosed by various domestic newspapers one after another. The authorities responsible for reunification and resisting foreign aggression are also touched by Acting President Wang's enthusiasm and have replied by telegram expressing their sincerity and hard work. Acting President Wang is thus slightly comforted. In addition to moaning in his sickbed, what he is always concerned about is encouraging his colleagues to fulfill their duties to save the country, and hoping that the national public opinion circles will unanimously advocate promoting peaceful reunification and jointly resisting foreign aggression. I have always admired your newspaper for upholding just opinions and acting as the mouthpiece of the people. I dare to ask you to promote justice, urge the peace conference to be completed, and awaken the people of the country to understand the right way to save the country, so as to comfort Acting President Wang's earnest wishes. This is my sincere prayer. The Alumni Association of National Beiyang University in Tianjin kowtows.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Destroys Northeast Consolidated Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Forces Cancellation of Andong Consolidated Tax ▲ Ling Yinqing's Bandit Army Organization ▲ Content of the Shenyang Puppet Municipal Government</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, Andong is the gateway for Japanese goods to enter the Northeast. After the National Government promulgated the consolidated tax, it also levied the consolidated tax there. However, the Japanese have always opposed it. Now that it has been occupied by the Japanese army, the Japanese forced the consolidated tax bureau to cancel it and revised an agreement. The articles are as follows: (1) All goods imported on Japanese ships docked at the Japanese-Manchurian Railway Affiliated Area, unloaded by trains, or transported for import shall be exempt from consolidated tax. (2) The Andong Consolidated Tax Bureau shall exempt the following imported Japanese goods and goods from Japan from consolidated tax, except for foreign cotton yarn under Item 51 of the first table and first part of the annex to the Sino-Japanese Customs Agreement, regardless of origin. (3) Foreign cotton yarn (Tariff Item 51) that has paid consolidated tax at various ports in China with proof will not be collected again in Andong. (4) Domestic products of China, when transported to Andong, that have proof of payment of consolidated tax in other ports, will not be collected again. (5) Goods that do not need to pay consolidated tax as mentioned above do not need to report or go through other import procedures when imported. The above is Japan's behavior of destroying the tax system on the date the League of Nations resolved to withdraw its troops.</p>
<p>The Japanese are assisting a group of bandits led by Ling Yinqing between Haicheng and Panshan, making them recruit desperadoes and organize a self-defense army to harass the temporary provincial government of Jinzhou. This is intended to indirectly create unrest in the local area, using the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to station troops and occupy the area for a long time, and to drive away our Liaoning provincial government agencies in Jinzhou to support the restoration faction in the Northeast to establish a new political system. The conspiracy is vicious and the intention is profound. According to the propaganda, Ling Yinqing's self-defense army has 17 brigades and 3 independent regiments, and the army headquarters is divided into three halls and nine offices. The brigade commanders and office directors are as follows: (A) Infantry: First Brigade Commander Yu Dahe, Second Brigade Commander Wu Baofeng, Third Brigade Commander Tang Erxin, Fourth Brigade Commander Cai Baoshan, Fifth Brigade Commander Wang Hechun, Sixth Brigade Commander Jin Xiangqian, Seventh Brigade Commander Liu Shuling, Eighth Brigade Commander Yu Xinshan, Ninth Brigade Commander Gong Zhetian, Tenth Brigade Commander Li Yuanqing, Eleventh Brigade Commander Li Ziqing, Twelfth Brigade Commander Li Qinghe, Thirteenth Brigade Commander Li Songyun, Fourteenth Brigade Commander Chen Fengzhu, Fifteenth Brigade Commander Feng Zhenying. (B) Cavalry: First Brigade Commander Gao Yuncheng, Second Brigade Commander Gao Zifeng. (C) Independent Regiment: First Independent Infantry Regiment Commander Li Yizhen, Second Independent Regiment Commander Fu Qishan, Third Independent Regiment Commander Li Dongmeng. (D) Army Headquarters Organization: Commander-in-Chief Ling Yinqing, Chief of Staff Wang Huaisan, Director of the Military Affairs Hall Wang Huaisan (concurrent), Director of the Secretariat Hall, Director of the Political Affairs Hall Huang Shifang, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office Sun Guofeng, Major General Director of the Staff Office Han Dumin, Major General Director of the Adjutant Office Wang Yinghua, Major General Director of the Logistics Office Du Liaoping, Major General Director of the Military Law Office Liu Yunwen, Major General Director of the Military Medical Office Xu Zhongsan, Major General Director of the Military Transportation Office Meng Juyi, Acting Director of the Ordnance Office Colonel Zhang Qinghua, Colonel Director of the Shenyang Office Guo Yongnian, Commander of Rehe Zhao Yaowu. According to Japanese propaganda, Ling Yinqing's troops number at least 200,000. However, according to those who came from southern Liaoning, Ling Yinqing is a ruined household in Haicheng who does not engage in production, wanders around, and became a local ruffian. He is now 36 years old and once served as the head of the Haicheng Security Regiment. His uncle, Ling Yiting, used to be under Feng Lingge. This time, he colluded with the Japanese. His troops are all recruited from salt smugglers and bandits from the coastal areas of Haigai Jin Fu. The number is about 700. The so-called seventeen brigades each have no more than forty or fifty people. On the 30th of last month, two brigades of the Northeast Army, Zhang Tingchuo and Sun Deqian, advanced to suppress Ling's bandits and met on the banks of the Taizi River, annihilating the bandit vanguard and killing many bandits. Ling led his remnant troops to seek refuge in Hulu Tuozi. On the same day, Japanese aircraft flew to assist in the attack, but the bandits still retreated due to lack of experience. Currently, Zhang and Sun's two brigades are guarding the left bank of the Liao River to prevent the bandit army from harassing.</p>
<p>Although the situation in Shenyang is not as serious as before, the puppet government of the restoration faction of Puwei has drafted an outline based on the puppet Four People's Maintenance Association, which will be released soon. Yuan Jinkai recommended Kai Zhaoxi as the Qingxiang Overseer, but Zhao Xinbo destroyed it and resigned to Honjo Shigeru. He did not go to the Maintenance Association office on the 4th. It is said that the successor will also belong to Puwei. The reason why the Shenyang puppet government has not been realized so far is that although it is due to the uncertain plan, it is also due to Yuan Jinkai's ambiguous attitude and his unwillingness to actively proceed, which has led to this. At present, the organization and scale of the Shenyang puppet municipal office presided over by Zhao Xinbo are almost the same as the old provincial governor's office, divided into eight offices, namely, the Secretary's Office, the General Affairs Office, the Works Office, the Education Office, the Police Office, the Finance Office, the Telegraph Office, and the Administration Office. It has jurisdiction over eleven external agencies, namely the Telegraph Bureau, the Electric Light Bureau, the Telephone Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, the Tram Factory, the Public Bus Factory, the Library, the Slaughterhouse, the Park, the Municipal Hospital, and the Museum. Feng Jingyi, the director of the Shenyang Self-Defense Police Bureau, was at odds with Zhao, so he was dismissed by the Japanese army. Xun Zhaoxi was at odds with Zhao and was excluded by Zhao. Qi Enming, the former commander of the Northeast Gendarmerie, also pleased Zhao with his lieutenant general status. Zhao then made him the director of the Public Security Bureau and merged the Self-Defense Police Bureau and the Security Bureau, with jurisdiction over 3,000 police officers. It can be seen that Zhao is becoming increasingly popular due to his appeasement of Japan. (1st)</p>
<h3>Investigation of Zhang Haipeng's Strength</h3>
<p>▲ Numbering About 7,000</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence, According to those who came to Beiping from Heilongjiang, Chairman Ma Zhanshan of Hei Province believes that Zhang Haipeng's ambition has not died, and that he has been surrounded and urged by the Japanese army, intending to invade the East again. For defensive purposes, Hei Province has no choice but to prepare. The Northeast Supreme Authority has telegraphed to appoint Ma as the General Commander of the Heilongjiang Army, and Chief of Staff Xie Ke as the Deputy Commander, so that the authority is unified and military affairs can proceed conveniently. After receiving the telegram, Ma and Xie established the General Headquarters in the East Courtyard of the Military Headquarters on the 29th of last month, and appointed Wang Jingxiu as the Major General Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, and Jin Kuibi, Shi Lanbin, and Wang Zhilan as the Colonel Directors of various groups in the Staff Office. Tang Fengjia, Li Menggeng, Jin Xijun, and Cai Yamin also serve as the Colonel Directors of the adjutant, logistics, military law, and military medical offices. They started working on the 1st of this month. Hanson, the US Consul General in Harbin, arrived in the province by China Eastern Railway train on the evening of the 31st and stayed at the Longjiang Hotel. Ma Zhanshan hosted a banquet at the hotel at 4 pm on the 1st to welcome him. It is reported that Hanson will go to Jiangqiao in person to investigate the destroyed situation before returning to Harbin. As for the news about Zhang Haipeng, it is said that Zhang's ambition is still very strong. He is currently stationed in Tailai, using the Guangxin Company branch as his headquarters, claiming to be the Mongol Border Supervisor. A blue flag with a red sun is hung in front of his headquarters. At 11 am on the 30th of last month, Zhang convened a military conference at his headquarters. Except for Fu Mingxin, the commander of the 3rd Infantry Regiment of Taonan, who did not attend, the other regimental commanders and detachment leaders were present, and there were also eleven Japanese people including Yamamoto, all wearing Chinese clothes, who participated in the meeting to discuss the distribution of military pay and the stationing of troops.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Zhang questioned Yamamoto, saying that Commander Honjo had previously promised to provide the army with seven aircraft and four field heavy artillery pieces, but why have they not been delivered yet? Yamamoto replied that aircraft and field heavy artillery are important military equipment in the country and cannot be lent out carelessly. A request must be made to the government before a decision can be made. The meeting adjourned at 1 pm. Currently, Zhang's headquarters in Tailai has established a bank called "Zhang Supervisor's Bank," issuing a temporary note, preparing to circulate it in the market, and announcing to merchants that "hereafter, for the purchase of goods by officers and soldiers of the army (Zhang's troops) in various shops, the temporary notes of Zhang Supervisor's Bank will be temporarily used, and the shops must not refuse to use them. Once this Supervisor (Zhang calls himself) takes over Jiang Province, they will be exchanged." As a result, the merchants in Tailai Town were greatly panicked and prepared to close down altogether. According to the investigation, Zhang's strength is about 7,000 people, stationed in the area from Tailai to Taonan, approximately as follows: (1) The Mongol Border Supervisor's Headquarters is located in Tailai County, with a pistol team of about 30 people and 15 military police stationed in the city, and the 11th Independent Regiment, with about 300 people, is responsible for security, led by Regiment Commander Bai Yongsheng. (2) Wu Miaozi, east of Tailai, is stationed with a first detachment, led by Detachment Commander Xu Jinglong (killed in the bombing), whose troops are all from the old 2nd Regiment, about 500 people. A second detachment, led by Detachment Commander Peng Fei, whose troops are all from the old 4th Regiment, about 500 people. A newly formed 1st Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Tang Jizhen, about 200 people. A newly formed 3rd Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Mi Kaiyuan, about 400 people. (2) Taipingchuan, west of Tailai, is stationed with a third detachment, led by Detachment Commander Liu Maoyi, whose troops are all from the old 5th Regiment, about 500 people. A newly formed 6th Regiment, led by Detachment Commander Li Zizhen, about 300 people. All units are currently under orders to move towards Tailai. (4) Xiawazi, also west of Tailai, is stationed with the 9th Independent Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Zhu Liansheng, about 300 people. (5) Jiejji is stationed with the 13th Independent Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Zhang Junqing, about 500 people. (6) Taonan City is stationed with the 3rd Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Fu Mingxin, about 500 people, concurrently serving as the Taonan Garrison Commander. A newly formed 3rd Infantry Regiment, led by a commander to be determined, is temporarily under the control of Fu Mingxin, about 200 people. A fourth detachment, about 300 people, led by Detachment Commander Zhang Junzhe, is Zhang Haipeng's eldest son. In addition, there are more than 200 newly recruited bandits, preparing to be formed into the fifth detachment, and the candidate for the detachment leader will be Zhang Si Shao, namely Zhang's fourth son.

<h3>The Dire Circumstances of Chinese Nationals Abused by Japanese</h3>
<p>▲ More Than 3,000 Returnees From Kobe</p>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department recently received a report from Yang Shoupeng, a standing committee member of the directly subordinate branch of the Executive Committee stationed in Kobe. The report details the Japanese conspiracy to exclude overseas Chinese and the facts of attacks on overseas Chinese by Koreans and Japanese. The original text is recorded as follows: "Since the Japanese army occupied the Eastern Provinces, Japanese officials have seemingly fulfilled their responsibility to protect our overseas Chinese on the surface, but in reality, there is a clear conspiracy to exclude them. Therefore, within a month, countless incidents of Koreans and Japanese attacking overseas Chinese have been discovered. However, few of the overseas Chinese in Japan are literate and have weak knowledge. Although they have been harmed, they often endure in silence due to threats and enticements from the other side. They usually do not know to request registration from the consulate, and when something happens, they do not know to report to the party branch or consulate. Therefore, this branch feels it is very difficult to investigate cases of overseas Chinese being victimized. Although personnel have been dispatched to various regions under its jurisdiction for thorough investigation, it is inevitable to miss some cases. Regarding what is known: In the Himeji area, Koreans plotted to attack overseas Chinese, barging into their homes to cause trouble. In the Gifu area, Koreans surrounded overseas Chinese, plotting to beat them. In the Nagoya area, Koreans repeatedly went to the store of Huan Jingui Wan Daosheng to seek revenge. Reports to the police station were either perfunctory or ignored. In the Kochi Prefecture area, Koreans besieged overseas Chinese Sun Shouqing and Sun Renqing. Reports to the police station did not result in the suppression of the violence, but instead, the overseas Chinese were threatened to return to their home country. In other places, such as Ni Tingxi in the Kurashiki area and Song Huaizhang in the Okayama area, their stores were repeatedly harassed by Korean rioters. Furthermore, on the night of October 10th, more than a dozen Japanese in the Gojo area of Nara Prefecture kidnapped Li Qijiang, an overseas Chinese in that area, forcibly dragged him to the suburbs, and punched and kicked him, nearly causing his death. On the evening of October 2nd, Korean rioters in the Wakayama area gathered in the thousands and launched a large-scale attack on overseas Chinese. Although the police maintained order, overseas Chinese Xu Hengfa and a Shandong person with an unknown surname were severely injured and fled back to their home country. Most of the above cases have been published in Japanese newspapers. Therefore, overseas Chinese in various places, seeing the lack of protection from Japanese officials, and even suspecting them of instigating riots, are all worried and competing to leave Japan to avoid harm. According to the latest survey, more than 3,000 overseas Chinese have left Kobe by ship. The remaining temporary residents in Japan, in addition to those clearing procedures and disposing of property, are mostly poor and have no money to return, which makes their anxious situation extremely pitiful. In addition to writing to the consulate at any time to negotiate and find ways to provide relief, we should prepare a document and report to your ministry for verification and request you to send separate letters to the relevant departments and offices for reference, which is convenient for the party."</p>

<h3>The 19th Route Army Passes Through Nanchang and Heads East</h3>
<p>▲ The Defense Area in Southern Jiangxi is Filled by Guangdong Troops</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The 19th Route Army, ordered to guard the Beijing-Shanghai area, has already departed from southern Jiangxi. According to a telegram from Ganzhou, the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army began moving towards Nanchang from the 10th of last month. Teams were stationed at various strategic locations along the Gan River and in areas where scattered bandits appeared, in order to provide security. All circles in Ganzhou believed that the 19th Route Army was very effective in suppressing the communists in southern Jiangxi, so they presented the army with several plaques and many flags. The plaque for Army Commander Cai read "The Great Wall of the Party and the Country," the plaques for Division Commanders Shen and Mao read "The Savior of the People," the plaques for the brigade commanders read "The People's Guarantee," the flags for the regimental commanders read "Immediately Eliminate the Red Banner," and the flags for the battalion commanders read "The Revolutionary Vanguard." The departure of the division stationed in Ganzhou has been completed, and the 60th Division will also depart. However, after the departure of the 61st Division, Li Yangjing's troops of the Guangdong Army will successively enter Jiangxi from Sannan and Meiling to fill the defense. The people of Ganzhou are also slightly more at ease than before. Currently, the regiments of Guo Siyan, Qiu Zhaochen, and Zhang Li of the 61st Division have arrived in the province in succession. Deputy Division Commander Mao Weishou also arrived in Nanchang on the 1st. The troops of the division were stationed at the Niuxing Railway Station and outside Zhangjiangmen. The Traffic Department of the division had also sent people to Nanchang and Jiujiang in advance to arrange everything. Therefore, from the 1st, they were transferred in batches from Jiujiang by boat to the east. The division headquarters also issued a notice yesterday, saying that in the midst of national crisis, we should all share the same hatred and resist foreign aggression. This division swears to act as the vanguard, level the Three Islands, and water our horses in Tokyo to avenge this shame. The propaganda team of the soldiers of the division also issued a farewell letter to the people of Jiangxi and the refugees in the bandit areas of southern Jiangxi, encouraging each other to eliminate the remaining bandits.

<h3>The Circumstances of Du Xuantai's Arrest in Hankou</h3>
<p>▲ The Police Department Discovered Clues by Inspecting Letters</p>
<p>▲ The Inspector Arrived in Hankou on the Same Ship and Arrested Him</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Du Xuantai, the chief of the 6th District Branch of the Guangzhou City Police, was the main culprit in the Guangzhou tragedy for ordering police officers to open fire and injure many people in order to stop students from inspecting Japanese goods. After the incident, he was detained by the Guangzhou authorities and tried by a special court. Unexpectedly, Du colluded with the guards and escaped. Many days have passed, but he has not been caught. Recently, the suspect fled to Shanghai and sent a letter to his friend in Hankou, saying that he could not hide in Shanghai for long and decided to take the Taikoo Company's Anqing steamship to Hankou for a temporary stay. The letter was discovered by those who inspected the mail in the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters. Knowing that there was a clue to this case, they submitted it to the headquarters along with the original letter. After careful consideration, the headquarters believed that the case was of great importance. Du was the main culprit in the shooting of the people, so they could not let him escape. Therefore, they ordered the Investigation Department to quickly find a way to arrest him and then ask for instructions. Ren Benzhao, the director of the Investigation Department, was a well-known detective. After receiving the order, he consulted with Inspector General Han Yushan and dispatched four investigators, divided into two teams, one team to Jiujiang and the other to Huangzhou, waiting for the Anqing steamship to arrive, and then sailing on the same ship. At that time, Mr. Ren received a new report, finding out that the suspect Du was indeed in a certain cabin in the grand dining room of the Anqing steamship, but his age and appearance were still unknown. Fearing there might be a mistake, he instructed the investigators on how to proceed, ordering them to dress up as merchants and job seekers in order to inquire at any time. The investigators then set off in batches. When the Anqing steamship arrived in Xunyang, the investigators boarded the ship. They went to the grand dining room to look for him, and saw two passengers, neither of whom was named Du. There was still one empty berth. The investigator joined them. He saw that one of the two passengers was in his thirties, looked flustered, and kept the door closed, refusing to open it. When he opened the box to get clothes, there were no business cards or letters in the box. He paid more attention and inquired about his name unintentionally, but he did not admit to being named Du. When the ship arrived in Huangzhou, the second batch of investigators also boarded the ship. The investigators who had boarded the ship earlier secretly told him what they had encountered, and they paid attention to investigating together. When Du took action, two people followed him, and one person pretended to be chatting and asked his name. Seeing that his answer did not match the name on the cabin label, they decided that he was Du. At about 2:00 AM on the 4th, when the ship was about to arrive in Hankou, the passengers were packing their luggage. Du also packed his luggage and removed his Western suit, replacing it with a blue cloth shirt. After changing his clothes, he came out of the room and stood on the deck, waiting for his friend to pick him up. An investigator named Liu, seeing that the ship was close to the shore, did not allow for any delay, so he pretended to be acquainted with him and called out, "Is Mr. Du well?" Du's expression changed drastically when he heard someone call his real name, but he still tried to hold on and denied being named Du. Liu said that he had met Mr. Du once before, how could he be mistaken? It was just that Mr. Du did not remember. As he spoke, he took out the original letter that the suspect Du had sent from Shanghai to his friend in Hankou, and asked him not to hide it. Knowing that his whereabouts had been exposed, Du readily admitted it. The investigators placed him under house arrest, and when the ship docked, he was escorted to the Police Department and temporarily detained in the military law office. It is reported that Garrison Commander Xia Douyin has reported the capture of Du Xuantai to the camp and asked for instructions. (November 6th)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Eastern Jiangxi Harass the Guangdong Border</h3>
<p>▲ The Guangdong Authorities Have Sent Troops to Defend and Suppress Them</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the 19th Route Army defeated the Red Army in southern Jiangxi in the Changjingkou area, the Communist arrogance has gradually subsided. Recently, the army was ordered to guard the Beijing-Shanghai area, and the troops have successively withdrawn from Ganzhou to Ji'an for concentration, and then headed east by boat to Nanchang and Jiujiang. Therefore, the defenses in various parts of southern and eastern Jiangxi are inevitably empty. The Red Army in the area has revived. Recently, it has been reported that a unit of Red bandits has harassed the northeastern border of Guangdong Province. Pingyuan County is adjacent to eastern Jiangxi, and the bandit atmosphere is particularly strong. According to a report from the Pingyuan County Office yesterday, the bandit situation on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border is as follows: (1) Huichang County was besieged by bandits on Gray Day. The local military and police joined forces to resist and were soon relieved. The Red bandits are now scattered in Wuyabo, Zhangfang, Huangkenkou, Guilinjiang, and Luanshi in Huichang (a county in eastern Jiangxi). (2) The Red bandits in Huichang are from the troops of Peng Dehuai and Deng Yigang, with a strength of about 10,000 people and thousands of guns. They seem to be moving towards Ruijin and Edou. (3) The defense forces have four aircraft to reconnoiter in Huichang and drop bombs, burning down a Lin family ancestral hall. (4) Peng Dehuai's communist bandits went from Luanshi to Shishui on the day of milling, and more than a thousand communist bandits came to Qingxi. More than a thousand refugees from Huichang came to the Yunmenling market. Merchants and civilians in Pingyuan County were panicked and fled in droves. (5) Xie Jiayou's troops of the Second District Bandit Suppression Corps near Xunwu are now stationed in Chengjiang, Pengu Pass, and Jitan. The Pingyuan urban area is stationed with a company of Yu Zhiying's regiment under Zhang's command, as well as a squad of the guard team and a squad of the core team. Zhang Ying's battalion is stationed in Datouxu, with sufficient strength for defense. In addition, Maoping, Niutougang, Datangshan, Penggongsai and other places in southern Xunwu belong to bandit areas and have been dispatched by Zhang Yingying in conjunction with the guards to suppress them. Recently, Chen Zhuomin, the magistrate of Pingyuan County, sent an urgent telegram again on the 29th, stating that Yunmenling was attacked by communist bandits this morning and the county was in a critical situation. He requested that troops be sent to garrison the area. After receiving the report, the authorities, in addition to immediately telegraphed Zhang Ruigui's division of the local defense force to send heavy troops to suppress the area, also ordered Zhang Meixin's troops of the 4th Division of the 2nd Army stationed in the Shilong area to go to the area for garrison. The 10th Regiment of Kong Kequan's troops of the division has arrived in Laolong, the 12th Regiment of Luo Jinying's troops is stationed in Longchuan, and the 11th Regiment of Wu Jianxiong's troops is stationed in Heyuan, forming a link with the Xingning Pingyuan defense forces. If necessary, they will go to the Pingyuan border to cooperate in suppressing the local communists and secure the border. (November 2nd)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Passenger Train Derailed on the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway's No. 1 train, which left Qingdao for Ji'nan last night, had a tragic derailment accident at the Putong Station, west of Qingzhou, at around 3:00 AM this morning. The reason was that the railway had newly purchased four Japanese locomotives, numbered 601 to 604. In order to test whether the No. 604 locomotive could run on the uphill section from Zhoucun to Dalinchi, Cai Guizao, the director of the Railway Machinery Department, specially accompanied three Japanese on a No. 133 first-class car attached to the rear of the No. 1 train's baggage car. They were planning to get off at Zhangdian and use the No. 604 locomotive to pull the No. 21 freight train for testing. However, according to the regulations, no cars should be attached behind the baggage car. When they arrived at Putong Station, which they were not supposed to stop at, the switchman saw that the baggage car had passed and thought that there were no more cars behind, so he switched the switch back to the No. 2 track. As a result, the wheels in front of the baggage car and the two front wheels of the No. 133 coach had entered the No. 1 track, while the two rear wheels were on the No. 2 track. When the coach reached the west end of the station, it derailed and tilted to the side. Cai Guizao and the three Japanese were thrown out of the car. One Japanese suffered a minor arm injury, and the car was also destroyed. The switchman fled after seeing the accident. The track was damaged, and the engineering section rushed to repair it. The train can still pass, but the train was delayed for two hours and fifteen minutes. According to insiders, the Jiaoji Railway has never had a precedent of department directors attaching special cars before. This bad practice has only started in recent years. The railway's losses have already been considerable, and this time another car was destroyed, resulting in even greater losses. (November 6th)</p>

<p>The notorious bandit Caiyi Ajin died of acute cholera. The two notorious bandits, Caiyi Ajin and Gan A'zuo, were arrested by the water police team led by Fan Dui and sent back to the Zhujing team headquarters for interrogation. The previous rumor that Caiyi Ajin had committed suicide in prison was actually a false rumor. The bandit suddenly suffered from acute cholera at 4:00 AM on the 4th, vomiting continuously. He was treated by a Western doctor, who said that the epidemic had reached its final stage and could not be saved. He died at 2:00 PM. The district department was notified by telegram and immediately sent Inspector Du to Zhujing to jointly inspect the body with Huang Zhewen, the magistrate of Jinshan County. It was confirmed that he had died of illness before death, and the death certificate was filled out. He was ordered to be coffined.</p>
<p>The Zhang family in Beixijing, South Wai, was robbed. At noon on the 5th, ten bandits with painted faces and clothes broke into the house of Zhang Ruichang, a villager in Beixijing, South Wai Thirteen Tu, near the Pujiang River, and searched for about half an hour before escaping with the stolen goods.

<p>The autumn tax is ordered to be generally reduced. The case of the general reduction of the autumn tax in this county due to the autumn disaster was previously investigated by the two departments of finance and mining, and it was entrusted to reduce the tax by 80% for relief. Later, the department thought that the proposed reduction was too large, so it added 30% as a final decision. However, the people in each district felt that the disaster this year was serious and the reduction was not enough to benefit everyone. The county farmers' association and other organizations telegraphed the provincial government to fight for it. Now it is ordered to open the provincial treasury, which is in deficit, and it is not convenient to reduce it further. It should still be adjusted according to the original plan and actually collect 95% per mu. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has followed the order and issued a notice to inform everyone yesterday.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>The Party Department Pays Attention to the Case of Embezzlement of National Taxes. The Kunshan tax collection officer, Hou Yiru, embezzled tens of thousands of dollars in national taxes. The county party department found out that he embezzled more than 700 yuan in silver from six households in one year. The county government was requested to thoroughly investigate the amount of embezzlement over the past ten years. Unexpectedly, the county government did not conduct a thorough investigation and sentenced Hou to six months in prison. Therefore, public opinion was in an uproar. It is now reported that the county party department believes that the county government did not conduct a thorough investigation, and they do not know what it means. Therefore, on the 6th, they sent all kinds of account books from the tax collection office, which were transferred from the Finance Bureau, to the county government and requested a thorough investigation. Hou's embezzlement of national taxes over the years will be clearly announced to dispel public suspicion.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>A Large Number of District Chiefs Were Arrested for Gambling and Visiting Prostitutes. The district chiefs of this county all came to the city yesterday to attend the local budget reduction meeting. Unexpectedly, after the meeting, four or five people, including District Chief Wu, went to No. 7 Hou Street to gamble. Tong Hongbin heard about it and reported it to the Fourth Police Station of the Public Security Bureau at 11:00 PM. The police were dispatched and found Wu and others gambling inside. The first district chief, Wu Xinheng, the eighth district chief, Yang Shaoqi, the fifteenth district chief, Shen Changjun, and the district fund management office, Gui Weibin, were immediately arrested. The tenth district chief, Wang Hongyu, escaped. Two prostitutes, Lao Qi and Shi Xiaosi Bao, were also arrested along with the gambling tools. However, Wu Xinheng changed his name to Wu Xing, Gui Weibin changed his name to Huang Liben, Shen Changjun changed his name to Shen Shouchang, Yang Shaoqi changed his name to Zong Juen, and the prostitute Lao Qi changed her name to Wang Xiaomei. The plaintiff's surveillance was very strict at the time. Unexpectedly, Wu and others falsely claimed to urinate and escaped through the back door. The police officer chased after them and only caught Shen Changjun. The county party department heard the news that night and sent the newly appointed supervisory committee member, An Weinan, to the Fourth Police Station to investigate. It was confirmed that it was true. However, the plaintiff negotiated with Patrol Officer Yao because three people had escaped. Yao had nothing to say. The next day, he sent only one person, who had changed his name to Shen Shouchang, and the two prostitutes to the Public Security Bureau. Wu, a staff member of the Judicial Section, interrogated them. As a result, after much mediation, only the three were fined 15 yuan to close the case.</p>

<p>The Provincial Supervisory Committee Recovers Illegally Reported Expenses. The Provincial Party Department Supervisory Committee presented the full-month expenses for August and the 16-day expenses for September of the Jiangyin Former Party Affairs Rectification Committee, with attached receipts. After verification, it was found that there was a compensation of 25 yuan for Zheng Woqing's instrument in August, which was inappropriate. The item belongs to Zheng's private property. Why should the public compensate for it? Even if it was borrowed by the public and stolen, it is the responsibility of the person using the item to compensate for it. Otherwise, if the staff of the association lose or have their private items stolen in the future, the public will have to compensate them. How can the public have so much money for compensation? Zheng should be immediately recovered for a sweat undershirt, worth 60 cents, which is a personal item. How can it be reimbursed? The former Standing Committee should be recovered for 18 yuan and 2 cents for wine and 1 yuan and 5 cents for cigarettes in September. There is an order that alcohol and cigarettes cannot be reimbursed. The former Standing Committee should be responsible for compensating for the money in order to respect public funds. After receiving the order, the County Supervisory Committee sent a letter to the Executive Committee resolving to recover the money as soon as possible.</p>

Zheng Yuanfeng Soy Sauce Garden, outside the North Gate Xiaosanli Bridge, was robbed by six bandits at 7:00 PM on the 5th of this month, resulting in a loss of more than 300 yuan. A thief was captured on the Hui Shang Bridge. The team was immediately led to interrogate the thief. He confessed that his name was Zhu Bao. He was then summoned to the team to identify the perpetrator. It was confirmed that he was the thief.

<p>An Attempt to Escape from the Detention Center Was Foiled. At 12:00 PM yesterday (the 6th), Wang Fukang, the warden of the eastern detention center of the County Court, heard a noise in the women's ward when he was patrolling the eastern area. He immediately reported to the detention center director, Yu Fu, who then reported it to the warden, Sun Gongwu. They went to check and saw a figure in the women's ward. They immediately shone a flashlight and ordered them to come down from the roof. At that time, the officers and soldiers of the Second Platoon of the Third Company of the Police Brigade stationed in the center were guarding the front and back of the building. After investigation by Director Sun, it was found that the person who had damaged the rafters on the roof was the thief Xu Genbao. The mastermind was Chen Adi, a thief who had been returned from the Third Suzhou Sub-prison. After counting the inmates, none had escaped. Strict surveillance was immediately implemented that night. Yesterday, Director Sun reported to the County Court Procuratorate and, together with the detention center warden, Wang Fukang, escorted thirteen prisoners with damaged shackles, including Xu Genbao, Chen Adi, Zhou Quanfa, Hua A'da, Guo Adi, Shi Hongpei, Zheng Chunquan, Wang A'hu, Yu Xingsheng, Gu A'er, Ma Xiaoheshang, Bao Jugen, and Zeng A'zhang, to the Procuratorate. Prosecutor Yang interrogated them. Wang Fukang was ordered to return, and Xu Genbao and others were mortgaged. It was reported that Xu Genbao was a thief with only a three-month sentence and had no shackles. Therefore, Chen Adi and others were urging Xu Genbao to destroy the rafters on the roof and then escape. Fortunately, they were discovered early, so none of them escaped.</p>

As a result, Yang Shao was ordered to provide a reputable business guarantor and await further summons.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Director Zhang's Views on Conscription: Pacification Director Zhang Zhijiang, in response to a letter from the Military Affairs Department stating that the Military Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan was drafting a conscription law and requesting opinions and materials on the conscription system from various military organizations, has proposed five points regarding conscription: (1) In modern international warfare, large military forces are required. Considering China's national conditions, public sentiment, and economic situation, a conscription system is most suitable. (2) Since citizens have a natural obligation to serve in the military, recruitment methods should not favor one side. (3) China has a vast territory and a large population, with varying terrains and customs. Conscription should be based on similar terrains, customs, and characteristics of the people in different regions. (4) In relation to the previous point, China should be divided into fourteen major regions: Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui, Fujian-Jiangxi, Hunan-Hubei, Guangdong-Guangxi, Yunnan-Guizhou, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shanxi-Shaanxi-Gansu, Rehe-Chahar-Suiyuan, Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang, Sichuan-Kangding, Ningxia-Qinghai, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet. (5) Each major region should be further divided into several conscription management districts based on local conditions, with designated conscription areas for each division.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Wheat Case Uproar in Jieshou: The dispute between wheat merchants and the public over the unloading of wheat in Jieshou Town has been ongoing, with strong disagreements from the public. The town's civil food mediation committee repeatedly appealed to the county party headquarters and the county government to find a solution. The county party headquarters submitted the matter to a committee meeting, which decided to send Zhang Jinshi to coordinate with Cai Chengshan from the county government to mediate. When Zhang and Cai arrived in the town, the public appointed Wang Caizhi and four others as representatives to negotiate at the Second Branch of the Town Public Security Bureau. Wang and others strongly requested assistance and stated that a previous mediation had occurred, with wheat merchants providing 500 bags of flour to the town's poor as a condition for allowing the wheat to pass. However, the wheat merchants considered this amount too large, and no resolution was reached. Subsequently, Zhang and Cai summoned wheat merchants such as Cao Dezhou for discussions. Cao and others stated that the matter had been brewing for a long time, resulting in significant losses, and finally agreed to donate 300 bags of flour. By this time, it was already midnight, and everyone dispersed. The next morning, the public suddenly formed a procession, declaring that they would rather sacrifice their lives than allow wheat merchants to transport wheat out of the area. Zhang and Cai, fearing unforeseen circumstances, requested the town's military police to maintain order. They then convened a meeting with representatives from the public, various organizations, and wheat merchants at the Fifth District Office to discuss the wheat case. The following resolutions were reached: (1) In addition to the 6,450 bags of wheat currently purchased by the wheat merchants, they would be allowed to pass. For all other wheat from merchants in the town, the various organizations would investigate and register. If the wheat was transported elsewhere for sale, the merchants would be responsible for purchasing rice with the wheat money to sell back in the town to maintain the local food supply. (2) Rice prices would be determined by compromising between the prices in Sishui and Gaoyou, and prices could not be raised arbitrarily. (3) Wheat would be bought and sold by a public grain company jointly formed by the Lu and Chen merchants. The price would not exceed six yuan per dan (unit of weight), initially for three months. The price would be jointly adjusted based on market conditions after observing the situation. (4) The 300 bags of flour donated by the wheat merchants to the poor would be temporarily stored by the relief center and managed by the various organizations. After the agreement was reached, Zhang announced the resolutions to the public, and both sides were very satisfied. The wheat case uproar was resolved.</p>
<p>Attempted Robbery of Firearms from Water Police by Bandits: The Third Squad of the Twenty-Fifth Team of the Sixth District of the Provincial Public Security Water Police stationed in Liuanzha Town was attacked by eleven bandits the night before last. Because the gate guard was dozing off, three bandits took the opportunity to enter and scout the situation, intending to seize weapons. At that time, a policeman woke up in bed, saw the intruders, and realized they were not friendly. He opened fire and shouted for help. Other policemen heard the alarm and immediately got up to pursue the bandits, who had already fled without a trace. It is heard that the bandits planned to rob the squad's weapons and then loot the entire town.</p>
<p>Drowning of Seven Dyke Repair Workers: The west bank of the dike across from Dangjunlou outside the north gate of the city was previously destroyed by water. The Water Conservancy Bureau hired workers to repair it. Yesterday (the 3rd) at around 4:00 PM, eleven dyke repair workers were crossing the river in a boat when it was suddenly caught in a whirlpool and sank. Neighboring boats made efforts to rescue them, but only five people were saved. The remaining seven drowned.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Silk Fabric Industry Refuses Inspection of Japanese Goods, Continued Report: The Yongruixing fabric store in Jiaxing, due to selling Japanese goods, was inspected by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association inspection team. The store immediately refused the inspection. By midnight, the inspection team sealed thirteen sample cabinets and took away several pieces of velvet. On the 5th, the store owners agreed to suspend business together. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Gu Suming, petitioned the county party headquarters and the Anti-Japanese Association. Employees of the entire industry also joined in. Because the demands were too far off-topic, no solution was reached on the night of the 5th. On the 6th, the industry continued to suspend business. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association convened an emergency meeting of all members, unanimously resolving to punish Yongruixing by suspending business for ten days according to the punishment rules for disrupting the association's work. They also petitioned the party headquarters to convene a joint party-government meeting to discuss stopping and punishing future strikes caused by inspections of Japanese goods. On the afternoon of the 6th, silk fabric industry workers petitioned the county government again. County Magistrate Gong considered the reasons insufficient and difficult to resolve, only agreeing to contact the Anti-Japanese Association for further discussion. The representatives left without obtaining any results. On the 7th, the industry continued to suspend business as usual.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Sending Personnel to Shanghai to Extradite Bandit Leader: Wu Tianbao (also known as Mud Carpenter A'gen), a notorious bandit leader from Fenghua, Zhejiang Province, had a gang of four to five hundred members. They committed hundreds of cases of kidnapping for ransom, robbery, arson, and murder in Fenghua, Tiantai, Ninghai, Shengxian, and Xinchang counties. Recently, they led bandits to rob a Ninghai ship, causing significant losses. After a thorough investigation, Wu went into hiding in Shanghai. The Security Department ordered detective chief Jiang Zhongyun to arrest him, but he was shot and killed. It is now learned that the bandit leader, whose evil deeds were notorious, was recently arrested by the police and handed over to the special district court. After receiving the news, the provincial government dispatched Security Department agent Wang and four soldiers, with official documents, to Shanghai to extradite Wu back to Zhejiang for severe punishment.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Foil Workers Strike: Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, is a major producer of tin foil. The foil workers who depend on this industry for their livelihood number over 500,000. The Finance Department received a telegram from the Shaoxing Jiang-Zhe Foil Tax Office, stating that the foil workers were on strike and requesting that the Shaoxing County Magistrate be ordered to stop it. The Finance Department considered the matter serious and immediately telegraphed the county magistrate, ordering him to stop it promptly. It is heard that the strike is in opposition to excessive taxes. The truth has been ordered to be investigated and reported.</p>
<p>Borrowing 300,000 for Rice Price Stabilization: The Zhejiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department, Finance Department, and Relief Association, recognizing that the floods in various counties this year are severe, with over a million starving people, and fearing food shortages during the lean season next year, borrowed 200,000 from the banking industry to purchase rice for price stabilization, using next year's dental tax as collateral. As this amount was insufficient for purchasing, they borrowed an additional 100,000 from the banking industry, using the purchased rice as collateral. An agreement is expected to be finalized and signed within this month.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Continued Report on the Ninghai Ship Robbery: The Yongxin Ninghai ship, after being robbed in Xue'ao Port, Ninghai on the morning of the 3rd, had its naval police captain, Lin Yaofu, escape to Ninghai, but he died the next day due to severe injuries. It is now learned that the ship has been released from the waters of Lichuan Reef off Taizhou and arrived in Ningbo at around 10:00 AM yesterday. In addition to the death of naval police captain Lin Yaofu from being shot by bandits, the robbery also resulted in the death of steward Lu Dezhi, who was shot by bandits and thrown into the river. Steward Dong Shangqing was shot through the palm, and Yu Baosheng was shot in the right arm. At the time, the bandits forced the shipowner, Shen Alian, to sail to Lichuan Reef. Because the valuables on the ship were insufficient to satisfy their desires, they kidnapped accountant Liu Zhonghao, hatchman Pan Youding, Zhang Quanmu, steward Zhang Azhu, peddler Mei Gao, Western assistant Xiaolang, and a passenger, intending to demand a large ransom. It is also heard that the stolen goods were worth several thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Village Chief of Fenglin Shot Dead: Fanshidu, south of Yin, and Dongpenpu, are not far apart and are located south of the Fenghua River. The area has thriving markets and dense residential areas. Ren Heshen, a wealthy resident, is currently the village chief of Fenglin. Unexpectedly, around 7:00 PM last night, six or seven bandits, armed with pistols, suddenly arrived at his home. Village Chief Ren, upon hearing the alarm, led several villagers to surround and capture them. However, they were outnumbered, and Village Chief Ren was shot and killed by the bandits. At the same time, two villagers were also seriously injured. The bandits did not dare to rob and fled towards Fenghua County.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Public Dissatisfaction with Autonomous Household Tax: The autonomous household tax, initiated by former Xiaoshan County Magistrate Du Shihua to fund district and township expenses, has been met with public dissatisfaction since last year. Recently, township offices have been established, and the household tax is still being collected. However, there are many obstacles to autonomy. The general public believes that the benefits of autonomy have not been seen, while the tax is levied on every household. This policy has not yielded benefits but has caused harm.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Raising Funds for the Township Defense Corps: The squad leaders of the Township Defense Corps in Xiaoshan were decided at a meeting convened by former County Magistrate Du. Training classes were opened first, with each township sending one representative, and each township raising 40, 30, or 20 yuan in funding. More than 20 representatives have been sent to the training classes. However, at a time when the four townships are impoverished, it is difficult for households to bear this expense.</p>
<p>Dispute Between the Anti-Japanese Association and Linpu Businesses: Linpu, a major town in Southeast China, has a thriving commercial sector. Recently, the County Anti-Japanese Association sent personnel to Linpu and confiscated Japanese goods stored in Zhao Dingxin's Yilong and other grocery stores, intending to take them back. However, the local Anti-Japanese Association and Chamber of Commerce refused. The County Anti-Japanese Association has sought instructions from the province. The Linpu side is also preparing countermeasures. Because Linpu is located between Shaoxing and Xiaoshan counties, the cross-border inspection and confiscation of goods back to Xiaoshan has angered the business community. Therefore, they have telegraphed the province, requesting impartiality. Otherwise, they are willing to sacrifice business rather than submit to Xiaoshan. This situation may lead to disputes between the two counties.</p>

<h3>National Salvation Against Aggression and Educational Transformation (II)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuanruo</p>
<p>Nature produces all things, and the superior prevail over the inferior. National survival also has universal laws. As the ancient saying goes, "As Heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman strives for self-improvement." This is indeed a consistent principle for self-cultivation, family management, and national governance. Mencius said, "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a person, it always first frustrates their spirit and will, exhausts their bones and sinews, and starves their body." This speaks of the diligence required for self-cultivation. Zeng Wenzheng's family management also emphasized diligence and hardship. He once said, "In diet and living, one should maintain the frugal style of a poor family. One must never covet luxury or become accustomed to laziness. Whether rich or poor, scholar, farmer, artisan, or merchant, diligence, hardship, and frugality never fail to prosper, while pride, extravagance, and laziness never fail to decline." This speaks of the diligence required for family management. In the past, Goujian was trapped in Kuaiji, endured hardship, built strength, and taught his people. Duke Wen of Wei wore plain clothes and hats, facilitated commerce, and benefited artisans, all with the spirit of diligence and frugality, wiping out shame and striving for strength. India, due to its inherent laziness and rigid social hierarchy, was conquered by the British. Today, Gandhi, with bare hands and without a single soldier, weaves coarse cloth and shares the hardships of the people. He, with his great and upright personality, and his firm and determined spirit, has actually enabled the Indian nation to liberate itself from the iron heels of British imperialism. It can be seen that the spirit of hard work and struggle is the key to establishing oneself, building a family, and prospering a country. National governance is not constant, but this is the foundation. National salvation and wiping out shame are the top priorities. The Chinese nation is deeply influenced by fatalism, believing that things will inevitably reverse, prosperity will inevitably decline, the laws of nature are cyclical, and human effort is futile. Therefore, whether towards people, family, or country, they do not know how to struggle and strive. This is why China has declined and failed to progress, and why it faces the crisis of demise today.</p>
<p>After suffering a severe blow, the Chinese people, having recovered from their pain, are trying to deeply investigate the roots of China's decline. This must be attributed to the failure of education. Among the four classes of people in China, scholars are ranked first. However, do their actions and thoughts really set an example and guide the masses? The purpose of education is to increase human knowledge and ability to cope with the environment and improve life. However, throughout thousands of years of national history, in terms of both spirit and material, not only has there been no progress, but things have been steadily declining. It can be seen that Chinese education has fundamentally failed and needs to be thoroughly transformed. The spirit of Chinese education for thousands of years has only fostered laziness, and the only desire of the intellectual class is to prepare for laziness. The so-called "ten years of hard study" is only a plan for "once and for all." Once they pass the imperial examination and achieve success, their status changes, and their behavior changes. Talented scholars no longer carry baskets, and successful candidates no longer walk. Today, those who are obsessed with foreign trends dream of foreign houses, cars, gourmet food, and luxurious clothing, all kinds of tools and equipment for laziness. Regarding the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, instead of using their intelligence to solve and improve their own living needs, they rely on others. For thousands of years, due to the laziness and parasitism of the scholar-officials, the lives of the general public have become increasingly difficult. The masses are also unwilling to accept their difficult lives, so they strive to seek opportunities for future laziness and comfort. The entire nation is driven by selfishness, greed, cowardice, revelry, debauchery, and laziness. Although the country is vast, the resources are rich, and the people are numerous, how can it not decline?</p>
<p>A country is founded on its people, and education is based on the people. A healthy national spirit is based on healthy education. In the past, Wang Anshi's reform was based on the realization that the morale of the scholars was not high, so he abolished poetry and essays to change the academic style of the era. Chinese culture has declined, the people's will has fallen, and the national situation is extremely critical. We must eliminate the lax and debauched laziness, the ingrained bad habits of following old ways and being lazy, and replace them with a new spirit of fortitude, hard work, and perseverance, as the foundation for revitalizing culture and saving the country. Therefore, education of the spirit of labor is the starting point for educational transformation, national transformation, national salvation against aggression, and national strength and prosperity. When the foundation is established, the way will be born; when the roots are strong, the trees will flourish. The words of a time of crisis, I believe, are not biased. The nation's chronic disease cannot be cured by treating the head when it hurts or the feet when they hurt. Correcting the root and clearing the source is the top priority. It is hoped that all the wise and experienced people in the country will rise up and plan for it. (End)</p>

<p>▲ Wang Bailing's Instructions: Wang Bailing said, "Jinan, Guanghua, Southeast Medical College, Jiangnan College, respected officials, fellow students, and comrades. Today I am able to be here to see your movements after one or two months of training, and I feel very satisfied. Since the Japanese atrocities, the entire country has been united in adopting a spirit of fighting to the death. This means that it is not just the students who want to fight to the death, but the government doesn't, nor is it the government that wants to fight to the death, but the students don't. It is that everyone must fight to the death together. If we fight to the death, we will have life; if we don't fight to the death, we will have no life. The government sent brothers to Shanghai to continue your enthusiasm, complete the permanent plan, and shoulder our important mission of saving the country. After arriving in Shanghai this Tuesday and organizing the training office at Labor University, I am responsible for the military training, and I want to achieve our goal of saving the country and sacrificing ourselves. I have a feeling about what I have seen today. You must have leadership in order to sacrifice and achieve results. Now that you are volunteer soldiers, you are not ordinary people, you are soldiers. The greatest purpose of soldiers is to sacrifice their lives. Under the current circumstances, if we don't sacrifice, we will become slaves of a conquered country, and there will be no chance to sacrifice. To be a soldier and fight, you must practice a hard life, not just formal training, but inner training. Secondly, you are educated intellectuals, and you must use it with value. You should be leaders of fifty or one hundred people, that is to say, don't learn to defeat one enemy, but learn to defeat ten thousand enemies. But learning to defeat ten thousand enemies starts with individual training. We hope to be able to lead a company or platoon to fight against the enemy, so that our students' sacrifices are not in vain. In summary, first, soldiers are different from ordinary people, and second, to learn to defeat ten thousand enemies, you must start with individual learning. I am now taking the enthusiasm of my life and combining it with your blood to form a crystal. Today can be considered the first day of the combination."</p>
<p>▲ Speech by the Representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Yu Zhongli, briefly stated: (1) We should always be loyal and brave citizens; (2) We must have the concept of avenging the country; (3) We must have a resolute and brave spirit; (4) We must have the determination to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Other representatives and guests did not give speeches due to time constraints. After shouting slogans, the chairman announced the end of the meeting, and the teams returned to their respective schools.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Western Association Football Match Jinan Defeats Lehua</h3>
<p>│Result 5 to 1│</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Lehua and Jinan lined up for battle at the China Sen Football Field. In the first half, Jinan took the lead with a score of 2-0. In the second half, Lehua also scored one goal. As a result, Jinan won 5-1, which was a scene from the Western Association's Group A competition. The referee was Zhou Jiaqi.</p>
<h3>Self-Inflicted, Lehua Falls Into Trouble</h3>
<p>Upon confrontation, Jinan's personnel were well-organized, both internally and externally, with little disturbance in the first fifteen minutes. Although their forwards were extremely aggressive, they did not achieve much, due to Lehua's tight inner defense and steady goalkeeper. However, at thirty-seven minutes, Lehua suddenly lost ground, due to Chen Zhenhe's pass from the center to the left, which was intercepted by Lehua's inner defender Chen Zhiming, who passed it to the goalkeeper. Just as the goalkeeper rushed out to save it, they met at the left, resulting in a fall.</p>
<p>▲Corner Kick, Jinan Wins Again</p>
<p>Having lost a goal, Lehua rose to fight, but soon weakened and was forced back by the enemy. At this time, Lu Zhong'en of Lehua suddenly fought out of danger from under the iron hooves of three opponents, which was greatly praised by the audience. The old general's past power was still the same. In the last two minutes, Fu Hexuan kicked a corner, the landing point was just right, and Feng Yunyou caught up and kicked it in, ending the first half with Jinan leading 2-0.</p>
<p>▲Lifting His Head, A Goal Enters</p>
<p>After the lemon time, Lehua first launched a strong attack, attacking several times, but retreated without success. Long Zhong'en stood before a formidable enemy, calmly dealing with the situation. Jinan knew that he was good at the upper road, so they focused on attacking the lower road. Mei Hongbao and Luo Haiguang fired twice on the ground, but were both saved by Lu. At fifteen minutes, Li Lin, the right wing of Lehua, secretly crossed the warehouse, picking it up with one foot, and Wan Xianghua greeted it with his head, bouncing it into the door, a clean and beautiful shot, which was very impressive, making the score 1-2.</p>
<p>▲Losing Three Goals in Succession Under Pressure</p>
<p>Jinan unleashed its fierce power, surrounding and attacking, and Lehua's two inner defenders resisted strongly, struggling to hold on for a long time. Under pressure, how could they remain unscathed for long? Before long, Luo Haiguang scored a goal, Fu Hexuan also cut in and shot, and finally Luo Haiguang got Feng Yunyou's ball and scored another goal, winning with a score of 5-1. In short, Jinan's strength was indeed superior, but Lehua also put in a great effort to compete, and although the victory or defeat was disparate, there was still much to see in between.</p>

<h3>The Beijing-Guangdong Representative Conference Successfully Concludes</h3>
<p>▲ Results of Seven Preparatory Meetings ▲ Separate Meetings of the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>▲ Issuing a Circular Telegram to Announce to the Public ▲ Representatives from Both Sides Report Separately</p>
<p>The Beijing-Guangdong Representative Conference, since its first preparatory meeting on October 27th, has undergone twists and turns. The convening of the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang, concerning party affairs, was the focus of the dispute between the two sides. The sixth preparatory meeting was therefore adjourned, and the peace talks almost reached a stalemate. Yesterday morning, Beijing representative Zhang Ji returned to Shanghai from Beijing with a solution. At 10:30 yesterday morning, the Beijing and Guangdong representatives met again at the residence of Wu [Zhaoshu] to discuss opinions on the issue of the Fourth Plenary Session. Both sides held a spirit of sacrifice, and the points of convergence gradually approached. The situation of the peace talks took a sharp turn for the better. After lunch at the Wu residence, the representatives engaged in thorough discussions throughout the day. The principles formulated by both sides were tending toward consensus. At 4:30 in the afternoon, they proceeded to hold the seventh preparatory meeting to discuss the details of the candidates, numbers, and qualifications for the Fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committees. It completely concluded at 7:30, passing resolutions that the Beijing and Guangdong sides would separately convene the Fourth National Congress in their respective locations on a fixed date, as well as other items. Thus, the peaceful unification longed for by people nationwide was realized. The Beijing-Guangdong representatives' preparatory meeting was declared a successful conclusion. Beijing representatives Cai Yuanpei and Wu Tiecheng will go to Beijing this morning, and Guangdong representatives Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and Chen Youren will return to Guangdong in the next few days to report separately.

Around 9:00, Zou Lu, Li Wenfan, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Mingshu, and Zhang Jingjiang also arrived. Zhang Ji, who had just returned to Shanghai from Beijing, also arrived last in the same car as Cai Yuanpei. Because the Beijing side had a solution to the problem of the Fourth Plenary Session, it was changed to a talk meeting. The two sides exchanged views on convening the session and other matters. The meeting adjourned at around 10:00. Zhang Jingjiang left first, while the other representatives stayed at the Wu residence for lunch.</p>

(4) Passed the circular telegram from this meeting to all sectors and party headquarters (original text recorded separately).</p>
<p>▲ Issuing a Circular Telegram to All Sectors</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting yesterday issued the following circular telegram to all sectors of the country: To all party headquarters, comrades, groups, and newspapers, since May, the phenomena of conflict between the Central Committee and the Guangzhou Extraordinary Conference, the Central Committee believes this is a dispute concerning political and party affairs, unwilling to resolve it with military force, and Guangzhou also believes that as long as important issues in political and party affairs are properly resolved, peaceful methods are more effective. Therefore, colleagues bear the mission of both sides, gathered in Shanghai for discussion. Since the beginning of the meeting, the first issue discussed was the diplomatic issue. Since the Japanese invasion of the three northeastern provinces, the crisis of survival has been imminent. In order to jointly face the national crisis, we should first seek a unified diplomatic action. Therefore, a resolution was immediately passed that the handling of diplomatic events will be the responsibility of the central government, and its policies and principles will be discussed at this meeting. The main points are: first, to appeal to the League of Nations and the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact on the fact that Japan has violated international faith, and to demand justice and judgment on Japan's tyrannical behavior, and to prepare for the final resistance in military and economic terms. With a consensus on diplomacy, we then proceeded to discuss political, financial, and military matters. The resolution on political affairs includes a reform plan for the central political system. Its principles are: (1) to enable the five Yuan to independently and responsibly exercise civil rights in order to realize the spirit of the civil rights system; (2) to simplify the political system and organization in order to increase political efficiency and avoid the ills of duplication, deflection, and dispersion of responsibility; (3) to make politics more democratic in practice; elected members should participate in the central political organs so that the relationship between politics and the people becomes increasingly close, in order to jointly bear the goal of establishing constitutional government. As for the methods, there are eleven articles, which have been disclosed in the newspapers, so I will not repeat them. The resolution on finance proposes the establishment of a National Finance Committee, jointly organized by the government and people's economic organizations, with the power to organize finance, review budgets, examine the issuance of public bonds, audit and report on sales, and announce income and expenditure accounts. It was also solemnly resolved that in order to prevent civil war, the financial income of the central and local governments, such as providing military expenses, should be limited to national defense and bandit suppression. The Finance Committee may refuse all burdens related to civil war. Regarding military affairs, it was also solemnly resolved that political disputes must not be resolved by military force unless a plenary session of the Central Executive Committee is convened with a quorum of more than two-thirds of the members and more than two-thirds of the voting members vote in favor by secret ballot. Regarding the resolution on party affairs, the Beijing and Guangdong sides will convene the Fourth National Congress in their respective locations on a fixed date in a spirit of cooperation. The methods are as follows: (1) Both sides will issue a circular telegram at the time of the meeting, indicating the unification of the party. (2) All proposals from both sides' Fourth Plenary Sessions will be submitted to the first plenary session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee in Nanjing for processing. (3) Both sides will negotiate the method of producing candidates for the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees. (4) The first plenary session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee will amend the Organic Law of the National Government and reorganize the government. The major issues concerning diplomacy, politics, finance, military affairs, and party affairs have now been discussed and decided. Other issues, such as guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of the people and pardoning political prisoners, are considered by both sides to be matters that should be implemented responsibly without the need for discussion. As for the two original drafts of the telegrams previously agreed upon, Chairman Jiang's resignation and the abolition of the Guangzhou National Government, it was originally scheduled to determine the date of publication after this meeting was discussed and completed. Now, according to Item 4 of the party affairs resolution, after the reorganization of the central government, the Guangzhou government will naturally be abolished.

<p>▲ Number of Seats for the Fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committees</p>
<p>At the preparatory meeting yesterday afternoon, the two sides discussed the issue of the candidates and the number of seats for the Fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, and tentatively agreed as follows: (1) Regarding the number of seats, it is tentatively set at twice the number of the Third Committee, at seventy-two. The number of alternates will also follow the original example, with two-thirds of the number of elected members as the number of alternates. (2) Regarding the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members of previous sessions, all have the right to be elected except those who have been expelled from the party for suspected communist affiliation. However, regarding the first item, the preparatory meeting made a temporary decision, and there is still room for flexibility in the central party headquarters of both sides in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Beijing Representative Zhang Ji Goes to Beijing</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting appointed Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, and Wu Tiecheng to go to Nanjing to report on the progress of the preparatory meeting. Zhang Ji had already departed last night. The representatives Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, and Chen Youren, who are going to Guangzhou to report, have also prepared their luggage and are waiting for the ship to depart.</p>
<p>▲ Wang [Jingwei] and Cai [Yuanpei] Receive Representatives from Various Sectors</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the representatives of all party members in Shanghai and the representatives of all employees of the Commercial Press went to Wu's residence to petition the representatives of both Beijing and Guangdong. Wang Jingwei and Cai Yuanpei received them. The representatives presented a petition and requested four points: (1) to determine a diplomatic policy and prepare to declare war on Japan; (2) to rectify party discipline and ensure that party affairs proceed according to the correct path in order to supervise the implementation of government politics; (3) to quickly implement political tutelage and strive for construction in order to conform to the fundamental purpose of benefiting the country and the people; (4) to ensure that military affairs are separated from politics and not mixed together, especially with the disclosure of finances as the basis. Cai and Wang then gave instructions to the entire group. Wang said briefly, "The peace conference has already begun, and the points of concern are also under discussion. However, I hope that we will work together with you to achieve this goal in the future. As for the diplomatic issue, we have a concrete plan, but foreign affairs cannot be made public. The reform of the political system and the process of the meeting, I believe you have seen in the newspapers in recent days. Our intention in meeting with various labor unions and university groups is exactly the same and does not need further explanation. In short, we came here to hold a meeting. For example, the Beijing representatives are definitely not here to represent the opinions of the Beijing government, and the Guangdong representatives are definitely not here to represent the opinions of the Guangdong government. At this critical moment for the country, we really unanimously advocate that the differences between the two governments should be completely unified. There are two other points that I can responsibly report to the comrades: (1) The hopes of the comrades who came here today are completely consistent with our hopes; (2) The prospects for peace are very smooth. Regardless of any rumors outside, I will never allow a breakdown. Please rest assured," and so on. The petition group also had two suggestions: (1) Please hold meetings in Shanghai in the near future; (2) Each representative should not base their opinions on personal considerations, but on the future of the meeting and the interests of the party and the country, to unify the country in the shortest possible time and unite against foreign aggression. Cai Yuanpei immediately replied that the first point was not a problem because the meeting was originally held in Shanghai. The second point was the hope of not only the comrades, but also everyone inside and outside the meeting, because in order to achieve a permanent solution, it was necessary to discuss it in detail. At this point, the representatives of various party members shouted slogans such as "Support the peace conference," "Long live the Chinese Kuomintang," and "Long live the Republic of China" and dispersed.</p>
<p>▲ Gathering of Beijing Representatives</p>
<p>After Nanjing representative Zhang Ji arrived in Shanghai with Central Committee member He Yingqin and others at around 8:00 yesterday morning, they went to Wu's residence by Hai Road in the same car to meet with Wu Tiecheng and others. Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Mingshu, and others also arrived. After the representatives briefly gathered for discussion, Zhang reported the process of seeking instructions in Beijing to the Beijing representatives who remained in Shanghai. At 10:10, they took cars together to Wu Zhaoshu's residence on Gordon Road for a discussion meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Gathering of Guangdong Representatives</p>
<p>Guangdong representatives Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Wu Zhaoshu, Zou Lu, and Li Wenfan had lunch at Wu's residence yesterday at 1:30 PM. They then drove to Hu's residence on Myers Road to discuss the discussion of the Fourth National Congress and other issues with Hu Zhantang, and exchanged opinions. After about an hour, they each left and went to Wu's residence at 4:00 PM to attend the seventh preparatory meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Hu Hanmin's Talk</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Hanmin issued the following statement to various news agencies yesterday: In recent days, some newspapers have published so-called circular telegrams from party members in a certain province and citizens of the eastern provinces, attacking me in many ways. It is expected that such trivial actions will follow the inadequacy of party headquarters and military personnel. My greatest goal in coming to Shanghai this time to conduct peace talks is to seek the true peace and unity of China. Therefore, I have no problems with people, but I will never be sloppy with things. This has always been my attitude and it has not started today. Since I followed the Premier in the revolution at a young age, it has been more than thirty years. In these thirty years, I have been hated by the Qing government, attacked by the royalist party, and slandered by various northern and southern warlords since Yuan Shikai. I have experienced so much that I can still deal with it easily. Therefore, I do not value the tricks of these people. I still remember in 1926, communist party members used this method against Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. In 1928, when I returned from overseas, a group of so-called party members also used this method to deal with me. I did not expect to see this old article again today. Moreover, these people who claim to be citizens and party members are a few people today and a few people tomorrow, and they seem to occupy a lot of space in newspapers, but among the millions of comrades and the 400 million people, they must be a very small minority. Yesterday, I read in the newspaper that Mr. Lü Guanqun, who was the leader of the Su party members who issued a telegram attacking me personally, denied the telegram the day after it was sent, saying that Guanqun was not aware of the telegram of the Su party members published today and that it was obviously a false name to undermine peace. Then it is likely that someone fabricated this matter and they had to resort to this temporary and makeshift method. Some people say that my criticism of political gains and losses is often too harsh, which is also true. The Cantonese proverb says, "A chipped mouth is afraid of a chipped bowl." If politics itself has no flaws, why worry about others' criticism and dislike it for being too harsh? It is lamentable that those in power cannot know their mistakes and correct them, but instead hide their illness and avoid treatment. Even when this peace and unity conference is held, some people strenuously argue that the words "peaceful unity" should not be used to prevent foreigners from knowing that we are not yet unified or peaceful. It is believed that in this way, foreigners will turn a blind eye to the truth about our country. This kind of absurd mentality is really shocking. In short, revolutionary party members should not shy away from admitting mistakes, and should not be afraid to correct mistakes. In the future, the true peace and unity of China should be the unanimous demand of the people of the country. The thorough reform of politics, party affairs, and military affairs is the only way to achieve this true peace and unity. I deeply hope that the people of the country will have a clear understanding and a firm proposition, and will not be deceived by some of these so-called party members and citizens.</p>
<p>▲ Chen Gongbo's Journey to Shanghai</p>
<p>When the Guangdong representatives came to Shanghai, it was once rumored that Chen Gongbo had also arrived in Shanghai, but it was later learned that this was not true. Chen did not arrive until recently. When Chen was in Hong Kong, Ding Jifen and others from Nanjing sent a telegram to him, inviting him to come to Shanghai. Chen telegraphed Wang for instructions on his whereabouts. Wang Jingwei received Chen's telegram at Hu's mansion and immediately replied, instructing him not to come to Shanghai for the time being. However, Chen had already arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong a few days ago. Xiong Kewu also arrived in Shanghai from Beiping a few days ago.</p>
<p>▲ Deng Yanda's Release</p>
<p>Deng Yanda, the leader of the Kuomintang's Action Faction, is still being held in Nanjing. In yesterday morning's talks, the Guangdong representatives raised the issue of restoring Deng's freedom, because Deng Yanda is not a communist and should not continue to be detained. At that time, the Nanjing representatives said that they did not recognize Deng Yanda as a communist and had no right to decide on their own. They agreed to forward the Guangdong side's intentions to Nanjing for handling. Chen Dezheng recently wrote a letter to a certain important person, asking him to intercede on his behalf. The important person said that Chen was not qualified and expressed his inability to help, so it was not brought up for discussion.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>▲ The Coal Transportation Association Sends Letter to the Coal Industry Association Yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, we have previously received a telegram from your association, requesting that the Central Committee maintain the coal shortage. We have reported the situation and repeatedly requested the Railway Department to increase the number of vehicles to transport coal. We have now received a telegram from the Railway Department stating that we have designated Zhongxing Coal to supply the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and Liuhegou and other mines to supply the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. If there are not enough vehicles, the Beining Railway Association will allocate them and implement them soon. We hereby reply, Railway Department, etc. Accordingly, we record the telegram and send it to you for your information and for the information of all fellow traders. To the Shanghai Coal Industry Association.</p>
<p>▲ To Prevent Mixed Sales, the Anti-Japanese Association Notified All Industries Yesterday to Pay Attention to Changing Japanese Goods to Domestic Goods for Mixed Sales, saying, "Dear Sirs, according to a confidential report, Yu Binqi of the China Products Trading Company on Guizhou Road changed Japanese goods such as Chinese typewriters to domestic goods and advertised in the newspaper to seek profit. Please investigate immediately, etc. After this association sent personnel to investigate, it was reported that Yu had no ability to invent and was obviously colluding with Japanese merchants who were stagnating due to the impact of the boycott, making a false signboard and passing off Japanese</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>goods as domestic goods, from which to profit. Based on this, we have long informed all industries that economic severance with Japan has been carried out, and all have complied. Yu has no reason and is willing to be a puppet of the Japanese, changing labels and impersonating to deceive the people of the country. Therefore, all sectors are notified to pay attention to the mixed sales of this product.</p>
<p>▲ Boycott Japanese Fish</p>
<p>(1) The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to the Ice and Seafood Industry Association yesterday, asking them to inform all fish dealers to boycott Japanese fish and not to sell them mixed. The letter said, "Dear Sirs, we have received a letter from the Fisheries Guidance Institute stating that a confidential report has been received that a large number of Japanese fish products have recently entered this port, impersonating domestic goods, and are being sold by various fish dealers in the 16th Pier of this city. It is found that these Japanese fish are all caught by Japanese fishing boats in our country's territorial waters. Since the Shenyang Incident, the fish dealers in this city have agreed not to sell Japanese fish, and since tariffs are independent and Japanese fish imports are heavily taxed, they have not been able to directly transport them to Shanghai for sale. However, the Japanese are very cunning and have recently changed their plans, first importing these Japanese fish from Dalian, transporting them to Yantai, and then impersonating domestic products, and then loading them onto merchant ships to Shanghai. This not only allows them to evade customs duties (domestic fish taxes have been waived), but also allows them to openly sell them cheaply in Shanghai. If we do not quickly and strictly boycott them, then Japanese fish will continue to come in, not only will the fishing industry in this city be disturbed, but it will also greatly affect the economic severance with Japan. Therefore, please check this letter, order the inspection team to strictly inspect at Wusong and 16th Pier, and order the ice fish dealers to refuse to sell the fish, and not to sell them mixed. To the Ice and Seafood Industry Association. (2) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Yin County, Zhejiang Province yesterday regarding the issue of salmon, saying, "We have received your letter, asking us to find out the difference between Russian-produced salmon and Japanese-produced Dongyang fish, etc. It has been found that salmon does have Russian-produced and Japanese-produced varieties, but because the types are similar and difficult to distinguish, the fish industry in this city has automatically refused to sell them."</p>
<h3>Nanyang Overseas Chinese Concerned About the Floods in Their Motherland</h3>
<p>▲ Donations Remitted Through the Hefeng Bank One After Another ▲ More Than 430,000 Silver Dollars and More Than 40,000 Taels of Silver</p>
<p>This year's flood has caused non-trivial damage to the Yangtze River basin. The National Government has specially set up a disaster relief committee to solicit donations from home and abroad. According to the investigation, Nanyang overseas Chinese compatriots have remitted more than 430,000 silver dollars and more than 40,000 taels of silver through the Hefeng Bank in this port as of the 7th. At a time when Nanyang specialty products have plummeted and commerce has declined, they are still so enthusiastic in their contributions. Their spirit of caring for the motherland and being eager to help others is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>The Sichuan River China Steamship Resumes Business</h3>
<p>▲ Emei Resumes Service Between Chongqing and Yichang</p>
<p>The Sichuan River waterway in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been the target of foreign steamships seeking to monopolize it. Chinese steamship companies have agreed to cooperate and have unanimously reduced prices and agreed to share water fees in order to save the situation. Later, because merchant ships were transferred to military transport, Chinese steamships in the upper reaches stopped service. At the end of October, they were released by headquarters. Now that the whole country is boycotting Japanese ships, Sichuan River Japanese ships have all stopped business in the middle of last month due to the strike of Chinese pilots. Chinese merchant ships can take the opportunity to resume service and recover shipping rights. China Merchants has decided to formally resume Sichuan River service with the Emei ship released by the headquarters. It has telegraphed the branches in Hankou, Yichang, Shashi, and Chongqing, ordering them to start soliciting cargo for Sichuan. The Shanghai General Office has completed the re-running of the Yichang-Chongqing customs license for the ship in Hankou and sent people to Hankou to hand it over to the ship before it is released directly to Sichuan. The Wuxing and Fuyang ships of the Sanbei Company have also resumed the Chongqing-Yichang route and have submitted a request to the headquarters to inform the navies and armies passing through various places to protect them along the way. This is the first Chinese ship to resume service in Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Close Down One After Another</h3>
<p>▲ Due to the Decline in New York Silk Market Prices ▲ Domestic Sales Are Also Impossible</p>
<p>Silk factory businesses in this city, after receiving silk industry bonds, had successively resumed operations, but are now closing down one after another. Of the city's 113 single and double cocoon factories, only about 20 are barely maintaining operations. Yesterday, a reporter from the "New Sound" newspaper visited Shen Yichen, chairman of the Silk Factory Trade Association, to inquire about the current situation of the silk factory industry. According to Shen, since the change in the British gold standard, the British and American economies have been greatly affected. Silk prices in the New York silk market in the United States have plummeted. Chinese silk, grade B, 20 to 22 filaments, 80 points for Innovas, sells for 900 taels of China Bank silver per dan. Japanese silk in the American market is intentionally depreciating, with the aim of absorbing cash. Grade B silk has fallen to 523 Japanese yen per dan, equivalent to 800 taels of China Bank silver. Chinese silk has therefore suffered a major blow, transactions have stalled, and Shanghai's export of Chinese silk has disappeared. Even when there is a market price, it is only about 820 to 830 taels per dan. At this market price, the export of Chinese silk, after deducting tariffs and other expenses, which are about 50 taels per dan, results in a net price of less than 800 taels. However, the cost of cocoons is 800 to 900 taels for spring and summer cocoons and 900 to 1,000 taels for autumn cocoons. When the price of by-products and waste materials is high, in addition to offsetting expenses, about 150 to 200 taels per dan must still be added to cover reeling expenses. However, the silk factory industry in our country has been sluggish for many years, and its strength is weak. This is indeed a major reason for its inability to maintain operations. At this cost, it is impossible to promote sales abroad and can only prepare to find ways to promote sales domestically. However, unfortunately, the 16 provinces have been hit by major floods, and all industries have been affected, especially the silk industry. At this time, it is truly a case of being unable to seek domestic sales or foreign sales. Since Japan forcibly occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, the silk factory industry has been even less able to maintain operations. The reason is that the by-products of silk factory reeling, such as double cocoons, long silk floss, cocoon skins, and adjusted cocoons, are sold to Shanghai double cocoon factories for some part of double cocoons. The rest are sold to Japan and Europe. Recently, sales to Europe have decreased significantly, and the Chinese people have voluntarily severed economic relations with Japan, resulting in a complete halt to the sales of by-products. No one is even interested in them. The cost of reeling labor and expenses per dan is bound to increase. Although the National Government has issued bonds, it is, in fact, a drop in the bucket and does not help. In order to avoid complete bankruptcy, various silk factories have had to temporarily suspend operations and await an opportunity. By the end of October, of the 106 single cocoon factories and 7 double cocoon factories in this city, only 26 single cocoon factories and 3 double cocoon factories were barely maintaining operations. At this market price, they may soon be unable to maintain operations and will continue to close down. For example, in Wuxi, only 18 of the 40 single cocoon factories are operating. The 25 single cocoon factories in Zhejiang are also closing down one after another. Therefore, the future of the silk factory industry is very pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Panic Over Raw Materials in the Knitting Industry Amidst Anti-Japanese Voices</h3>
<p>▲ One-Third of Businesses Have Shut Down ▲ Quietly Awaiting the Arrival of British Yarn to Alleviate the Shortage ▲ Trade Association Prepares to Establish a Fine Yarn Factory</p>
<p>After Japan forcibly occupied our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, various industries voluntarily refused to import Japanese raw materials. The yarn and raw materials of the knitting industry in this city have experienced a panic, resulting in more than 400 businesses, for the sake of resisting Japan and saving the country, vowing to no longer import Japanese raw materials, and willingly suspending work, quietly waiting for British goods to arrive in Shanghai to alleviate the shortage. The various situations are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲ Successive Closures The knitting businesses include factories producing socks, undershirts, thermal shirts, gloves, scarves, and woolen shirts. The raw materials are mainly yarn, followed by silk, rayon, and wool. The most common yarn is 42-count and 60-count double-strand, followed by 100-count and 120-count. The most common yarn count is 20-count single-strand. However, Japanese goods account for 70% of the city's yarn supply, while domestic goods account for only 30%. Since the refusal to import Japanese raw materials, the demand for domestic yarn has exceeded supply, and prices have been raised opportunistically. For the sake of resisting Japan and saving the country, more than 400 businesses in the city have been forced to temporarily suspend operations due to a lack of raw materials. The majority of these are small, family-style factories.</p>
<p>▲ Quietly Awaiting Relief After the various businesses decided to no longer import Japanese raw materials, in order to alleviate the panic over raw materials, they specially ordered yarn and raw materials from British trading companies in Shanghai, totaling approximately 13,000 pieces, with 40 bundles per piece and 10 pounds per bundle. The goods are expected to start arriving in Shanghai successively as early as December of this year. Factories that have already suspended operations are quietly awaiting the relief of British raw materials. As for businesses that are still operating, they have little yarn and raw material inventory. If the British goods have not arrived in Shanghai by the end of this month, the number of businesses that have suspended operations may increase to one-third. The price of various socks has also increased by 30 cents per dozen due to cost considerations.</p>
<p>▲ Preparing for a Fine Yarn Factory The Knitting Industry Trade Association, in order to completely refuse to import Japanese yarn and raw materials, and in light of the opportunistic price increases of Chinese yarn, convened a meeting of all businesses in the city to discuss the preparations for establishing a fine yarn factory, with a planned capital of 1 million taels and 1 million spindles, specializing in spinning double-strand yarn, with 42-count as the medium grade. Currently, due to (1) financial resources and (2) talent issues, the plan has stalled indefinitely. However, the Trade Association still intends to find ways to actively proceed.</p>
<h3>Ding Shujing Pays Attention to the Kellogg-Briand Pact</h3>
<p>▲ Reply to the New York Women's Association Telegram ▲ Requesting Immediate Implementation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact</p>
<p>Ms. Ding Shujing, General Secretary of the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China, recently received a letter and telegram from Mrs. Suler, Director of the International Goodwill Department of the New York Women's Association, inquiring whether Chinese women have formed war abolition organizations. It is heard that Ms. Ding replied to Mrs. Suler by telegram the day before yesterday, asking her to announce her opinions at the European War Armistice Peace Memorial Banquet held by the New York Women's Association on the 7th. The original telegram from Ms. Ding has been found and translated into Chinese as follows: To Mrs. Suler, Director of the International Goodwill Department of the New York Women's Association, Chinese women have not specifically formed organizations for war abolition, but they unanimously regret the use of war to resolve international disputes and sincerely hope that the world will create lasting peace in the future. China has now sincerely abided by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but in view of the current situation, there is some doubt about the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If the League of Nations is unable to implement its resolutions, China will inevitably seek justice by other means. Therefore, in this serious situation, all peace-loving women around the world should unite immediately and strive to urge the governments of the signatory countries to fulfill their obligations under the treaty. I, Ding Shujing, sincerely reply that Chinese women who believe in peace will also do their best in this war abolition work.</p>
<h3>Women's National Salvation League Hosts Representatives of the Pacific Institute</h3>
<p>▲ Striving for International Publicity ▲ Lecturing on Japanese Atrocities</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Women's National Salvation League has spared no effort in external publicity. Yesterday, the league hosted women representatives of the Pacific International Institute at its office on the fifth floor of the Women's Bank, and invited prominent women to accompany them. At around 7 o'clock, more than 60 staff members and Chinese and Western guests were present, creating a grand scene for a while. After the chairman, Mrs. Mei Huaquan, delivered a welcome speech during the banquet, she elaborated on the motivation for the establishment of the league. Then, Ms. Huang Shaolan gave a lecture on the brutality of Japan in our three northeastern provinces, and appealed to the representatives to return to their countries after being affected by the peace-loving psychology of women, and to publicize the facts of the Sino-Japanese dispute in detail to their people, so that justice can be realized and the world can be in great harmony. Finally, the chairman introduced Mrs. Morrison, president of the American Women's Political Association, Mrs. Heck, president of the Canadian Women's Association, Mrs. Anderson, Minister of Labor of the International League, and Ms. Siwei, director of the Australian Child Welfare Department, to give speeches. The general content of their speeches was to uphold justice and admire the increasing status of Chinese women and their ability to work hard for the country.</p>

<h3>The Coal Industry Association Will Hold an Executive Committee Meeting Today</h3>
<p>▲ The Price Increase on the Jiaoji Railway Has Not Been Cancelled ▲ Discussion of Measures to Request the Ministry of Railways to Stop It</p>
<p>Since the coal merchants refused to sell Japanese coal, they have been striving to promote the sale of domestic coal. Due to the increase in freight rates on the Jiaoji Railway, coal mine merchants sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Railways, requesting that it be stopped. They were completely accommodated, but three conditions for exchange were put forward, which the coal mine merchants also expressed their acceptance of. The Ministry of Railways agreed to immediately send a telegram to the Jiaoji Railway ordering the temporary cancellation of the price increase, and then to revise a fair freight rate from a long-term perspective. Currently, the Jiaoji Railway has not cancelled the price increase, resulting in a continuous strike by Shandong merchants that has not been resolved. The Coal Industry Association of this city has decided to convene a temporary executive committee meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss measures to request the Ministry of Railways to promptly order the Jiaoji Railway to cancel the price increase.</p>

<h3>The Disturbance at Dongxin Bridge Last Night</h3>
<p>▲ Streetcar Windows on the Fifth Route Smashed ▲ Some Disturbances Also in the Public Concession</p>
<p>At about 7 o'clock last night, a streetcar on the Fifth Route, operated by a French company, was returning from the North Railway Station to Xieqiao. When it arrived at the corner of Dongxin Bridge on Avenue Edward VII, more than a hundred people, resembling students and workers, rushed out of Xiaobeimen, each holding red flags and wooden sticks, shouting slogans along the way and attacking together, causing several streetcars, including numbers 3, 11, 12, and 23, to stop.

<h3>Inside Story of the Forced Abduction of a Boy</h3>
<p>▲ The Child Was a Kidnap Victim from Da Zhangjing ▲ The Water Police Did Not Ask for the Assistance of the Police Station</p>
<p>▲ Hurriedly Going to Abduct Caused Misunderstandings ▲ The Two Female Bandits Are Still Detained Awaiting Trial</p>
<p>Xu Agen, a native of Wuxi who lived at No. 1041 Yangshou Road, had tenants living on the front floor, Yin Zhao and Xu Shuai, Anhui women, who brought with them an unnamed boy of about ten years old. Suddenly, at 8:15 PM on the 30th of last month, while the two women were out, six people who looked like detectives from the police station came upstairs in a hurry, acting like they were arresting someone. As a result, they dragged the child down the stairs, pulled him into a car waiting in the alley at the door, and drove away quickly. Xu reported the situation to the Yangshupu Police Station, who sent detective Zhang Yunjian and West detectives to arrest the two women and bring them to the First Special District Court for questioning. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. On the 5th of this month, the police station saw a report stating that in Liuzao Base, Da Zhangjing, Songjiang, the family of a farmer, Han Liansheng, had their 13-year-old son, Han Quanfa, kidnapped by Taihu bandits in early September. The bandits had repeatedly sent letters demanding a huge ransom. Han, because his family was not wealthy, reported the case to the water and land public security police for assistance. Recently, Fan Guozhong, captain of the First Detachment of the Jiangsu Water Public Security Bureau stationed in Zhujing Town, Jinshan County, learned that Han's child was being hidden at No. 1041 Yangshupu Road, Shanghai, and went to Shanghai with detectives to rescue Han's child in cooperation with the police station, and brought him back to the Zhujing Detachment Headquarters. The family identified him, and a copy of Han's child's portrait was taken. Reading the report was shocking and seemed to match the case. The two women were again escorted to the court, and Xu Shuai's sister, a young woman named Xiao Yatou, was asked to identify whether the portrait of Han's child in the newspaper was the ten-year-old boy who had been dragged away from the front floor of her house. She said that it was not the child, and since the second landlord, Xu Agen, had not arrived, the court adjourned the hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong presided over the investigation in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that the investigation had confirmed that Han Quanfa, the 13-year-old child who had been kidnapped by bandits in Liuzao Base, Songjiang, was indeed the boy who had been taken away in this case. However, the police station did not go with the detectives from the water patrol team to assist in the arrest. Today, the team had detectives in court for other matters, and the second landlord, Xu Agen, had also been summoned. He requested that they be questioned. Xu Agen testified that the six people who came to take the boy at the time said that they had orders, and when he tried to stop them, the group briefly showed him a card, but he did not see it clearly. When the police lawyer Zhang showed him a photo of Han's child from the newspaper, he said that it was indeed the child, and that the old woman from Anhui who had introduced the two defendants to rent the front floor had moved elsewhere and could not be found. Zhou Liancheng, a detective from the First Detachment of the Jiangsu Water Public Security Bureau, testified that Han Quanfa, the 13-year-old child, had his home robbed on the night of September 16, and thousands of copper coins were stolen. Before fleeing, the child was kidnapped for ransom. The informant had reported that Han's child was hiding at No. 1041 Sanxingli, Yangshupu Road, Shanghai. Therefore, the detective leader and others went to look for him. There was only No. 1041 Sanyili. Due to the limited time, they did not have time to ask the police station to send detectives to assist in the arrest. When questioned, the testimony of the two women was evasive. Judge Shen reviewed the testimony and declared to detective Zhou that Han's child should be brought to court for identification at the next hearing. Detective Zhou agreed, and the judge ordered the two women to be detained and the hearing was adjourned for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Major Robbery of River Boats on the Upper Yangtze</h3>
<p>▲ Stolen Goods Valued at Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars ▲ Forty-Seven Crew and Passengers Kidnapped</p>
<p>▲ The Puji Company River Boats Robbed After the major floods receded in Hunan and Hubei provinces, upper Yangtze River merchant guilds rushed to Shanghai to purchase goods for their markets in Changsha, Xiangtan, Changde, and Yuanjiang in Hunan. Since the boycott of Japanese goods, even more domestically produced goods have been purchased in Shanghai. In addition, large quantities of sugar and grains have recently been transported to Hunan province for export. The Puji Company has been managing many of these shipments. Recently, a shipment of approximately 4,000 items, handled by Puji for transport to Hunan, was first loaded in Shanghai for Hankou. From Hankou, it was then transferred to four towed barges, pulled by a small steamboat, heading for Changsha, Xiangtan, Yuanjiang, and Changde in Hunan. As the barges passed the vicinity of Chenglingji, they were suddenly attacked by bandits. There were no soldiers stationed on the barges for protection, leaving no way to resist, and the bandits simply seized and towed them away. The bandits were numerous, and there were no warships nearby. The small steamboat, the four barges, and all the cargo were taken. The value of the goods is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, making this the largest recent robbery on the upper Yangtze River.</p>
<p>▲ Crew Members Missing With the cargo stolen, the boats were also seized. There were a total of forty-seven sailors, deckhands, and security personnel on the small steamboat and the four barges. They were also kidnapped by the bandits. After receiving the report, Puji immediately notified the authorities in Hunan and Hubei provinces, as well as the upper Yangtze River naval forces, requesting them to investigate and rescue the kidnapped individuals. Since the incident occurred several days ago, despite investigations by land and naval forces, there have been no leads, and none of the forty-seven kidnapped individuals have returned. Their fate is unknown. It is rumored that some of the cargo was insured, while some was not. The merchants have submitted a petition to the authorities demanding a thorough investigation. Recently, ships traveling along the upper Yangtze River, particularly through the Chenglingji area, have been under strict surveillance. Foreign merchant ships are even being escorted by the navy to prevent further incidents.</p>
<h3>Chinese Should Participate in Land Valuation Meetings</h3>
<p>▲ Number of Representatives Should Be at Least Equal to Foreigners ▲ Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council for Implementation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter yesterday to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, which stated: "Dear Sir, further to the Shanghai Real Estate Association's letter stating that while Chinese landowners within the Shanghai International Settlement own more land than foreigners, Chinese citizens have never had the opportunity to participate in land valuation. We dare not say there is a false impression of overvaluing land to increase land taxes, but there are often facts that are insufficient to gain the consent of property owners. There is suspicion that landowners are eager to overestimate land prices in order to increase rents or make it easier to sell the land at a good price. In fact, the real estate industry is extremely worried about the danger of real estate becoming a speculative target. Therefore, when the Municipal Council drastically increased land prices last year, the Association strongly protested to the Municipal Council. Now we understand that the Municipal Council’s land valuation will break with past practice and shorten the valuation period. The real estate industry believes this matter is of vital interest. Regardless of the length of the valuation period, the Municipal Council should invite impartial Chinese citizens to join the Land Valuation Committee as members to handle the valuation matters jointly. The number of representatives should be at least equal to that of foreigners. Although this matter seems to only relate to the real estate industry, its impact actually extends to all residents within the Settlement. We respectfully request that your association forward this proposal to the Municipal Council for implementation, in order to demonstrate fair treatment." Approved. "Having reviewed the above, this association believes the points raised are very reasonable and should be implemented immediately to demonstrate cooperation. We are sending this letter accordingly, and hope you will investigate and handle the matter."</p>
<h3>New Stamps with Sun Yat-sen's Portrait to Be Issued on His Birthday, Limited to Key Areas</h3>
<p>▲ Nationwide Availability Expected by Year-End</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts, ordered stamps bearing the portrait of Sun Yat-sen from the Waterlow and Sons Limited printing company in England. They arrived in Shanghai two months ago and were submitted to the Ministry for approval of the issuance date. However, due to other issues, the release was repeatedly delayed. Recently, the Directorate General received an order from the Ministry to issue the stamps on November 12, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. These new stamps with Sun Yat-sen's portrait are intended for general circulation. However, the various branch offices throughout the country still have a large stock of sailboat and farming-themed stamps, which need to be used up before the new stamps are widely distributed, a process expected to take several months. Moreover, of the initial shipment of 120 million stamps printed in England (the Sun Yat-sen stamps), there is a need to reprint specimen stamps of the martyrs at the Plain Paper Printing Bureau in Beijing, which have not yet been submitted to the Directorate General for review, causing delays. Currently, the Directorate General has instructed all postal districts nationwide to issue the stamps on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. The Shanghai Postal Supply Office is managing the allocation and transportation. However, the number of new Sun Yat-sen stamps sent to Shanghai is limited, insufficient to distribute to all eighty-three postal districts nationwide. It is expected that a large quantity will arrive at the end of this month or early next month. Once they arrive, the Supply Office will actively distribute them to all postal districts for use. It is anticipated that the new stamps will be available nationwide by the end of the year.</p>

The two buildings at numbers 1 and 2, Lane 40, Qiaojiazhai, are owned by Yao, but they are old and in disrepair. Yao's family does not live there, and the buildings are used as a warehouse for storing finished products and raw materials. Behind the warehouse is a large courtyard where Yao stores dozens of bundles of short bamboo (used for making flutes), piled approximately two zhang (about 20 feet) high. Behind the courtyard is a high wall, and behind the wall is a small alley, which serves as the back entrance for number 28, Qiaojiazhai. The residents of number 28 are mostly laborers, numbering more than ten families. They use this alley for washing vegetables and clothes. Yesterday at approximately 11:00 AM, Yao needed short bamboo from the warehouse for making flutes, so several employees went to the bamboo pile to retrieve the material. However, the bamboo strips had been exposed to rain and sun for too long and had loosened. As the employees stepped on the pile, it scattered, and the entire pile of bamboo suddenly collapsed backward. The high wall behind it was unable to withstand the pressure and collapsed backward with a crash. At the time, residents of number 28 were preparing lunch, so women were washing vegetables and rice in the alley. They were unable to avoid the collapsing wall and were buried underneath.

<h3>Deception at Wan Dagong Sauce Garden</h3>
<p>▲ Selling Cheap Oil to Defraud Customers of Large Sums of Money ▲ Business Transacted the Day Before, Shut Down and Fled Yesterday</p>
<p>Recently, a certain Wang and others opened the Wan Dagong Sauce Garden at number 86, Ninghe Road in the Nanshi district, and scheduled to begin transacting business on the 6th of this month, choosing an auspicious day for the opening. On the day of the transaction, the 6th, around 5:00 AM, people from near and far who had heard the news arrived and waited. Around 6:00 AM, the store opened, and customers rushed in, eager to buy soy sauce and other products. Soybean oil was sold at seven jin (approximately 8.8 pounds) per dollar, which buyers considered a bargain. The news spread quickly, and the number of customers increased, reaching several hundred. By midday, the influx of customers showed no sign of diminishing, and the store was packed with people. Many were crowded outside the door and in the street, obstructing traffic. At that time, the store suddenly announced that they had sold twenty-four large baskets of soybean oil and only had four baskets left, which was not enough to meet the demand. The store asked customers to be understanding and stated that those who wished to purchase oil would have to accept a rate of six jin and twelve liang (approximately 8.5 pounds) per dollar. They were instructed to pay and would be issued a receipt, which they could redeem for oil at any time. Many customers believed this was a great bargain, and they willingly paid and received receipts. By 5:00 PM, approximately three thousand dollars' worth of receipts had been issued. However, at 6:00 AM the next morning, many customers gathered in front of the store, each holding a receipt and wanting to exchange it for oil. But after waiting a long time, the store did not open. The crowd became suspicious and began to protest loudly. The incident was reported to the third sub-station of the first district. Police Chief Wang Zuoxian rushed to investigate and found the area outside the store packed with customers. He pushed through the crowd and managed to open the door. However, the store owner and employees were nowhere to be found. The store contained only a counter, four baskets of soybean oil, and three or four cudgels. After explaining the situation to the crowd, they realized they had been swindled and dispersed, feeling cheated. Police Chief Wang took Zhu Pu, a local who was the landlord of the building, to the station. Director Jin conducted a preliminary interrogation and ordered Zhu to prepare a document reporting the incident to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

Yesterday, the City District Planning Association convened a meeting of all committee members and decided that the work of surveying the population must be completed by the end of December this year in order to complete the preparations for autonomy by June next year.</p>
<h3>County Government Discusses Dredging Yu Tang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yu Tang, a river within the county, is gradually becoming silted up. A plan to dredge it is under discussion. The county government, believing that the water level is low in winter and dredging should be implemented immediately, convened a meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included Wu Jingqing, the chief of the first district; Peng Zhaotang, the chief of the second district; Sun Shiben, the chief of the third district; Wang Chengyao, the chief of the sixth district; Lin Junhuang of the Construction Bureau; Ye Dezhen, the secretary of the county government; Yu Tingfen, the section chief; and Yan Shenyu, the county magistrate, as chairman; and Hu Gongshou, as recorder. The meeting followed due protocol. The chairman began by reporting that funds had been raised for dredging Yu Tang and that dredging should be implemented during this winter leisure time for farmers. All projects should be implemented, and practical measures should be discussed together. The following was then discussed and resolved: (1) How should the river engineering office be organized? Resolution: A. A general river engineering office should be established in Beiqiao, and branch offices should be established in Maqiao and Tangwan. B. The general river engineering office should have a director and a deputy director. Chief Sun was appointed as director and Chief Wu as deputy director. The Maqiao and Tangwan branch offices should each have a director. Chief Wang was appointed as director of the Maqiao branch, and Chief Peng as director of the Tangwan branch. C. The chief of the engineering section of the river engineering committee should be the chief supervisor, and the members of the section should be the supervisors. In addition, the Construction Bureau should send two supervisors. D. The general river engineering office should have two clerks. One should be appointed by the director, with a monthly salary of 20 yuan. One should be assigned by the Construction Bureau, providing meals but no salary. E. The general and branch offices should each have one worker, each receiving 10 yuan per month for food and labor. F. The supervisors of the general and branch offices should each receive a subsidy of 20 yuan. G. The general and branch offices should each receive 40 yuan per month for office expenses. H.

Resolution: It should be handled immediately after the construction of the dams. (6) Should a water pump be purchased to facilitate water drainage? Resolution: The office in charge of urging payment of debts should quickly purchase one.</p>
<h3>Navigation Bureau Urges Replacement of Ship Nationality Certificates</h3>
<p>The Navigation Bureau previously received an order from the Ministry of Communications that all steamships and civilian ships must replace their Ministry-issued licenses with ship nationality certificates at the Bureau before the end of this year. However, because few ships have come to the Bureau to exchange their licenses, the Bureau is again urging all steamships and civilian ships to quickly replace their licenses with certificates at the Bureau before the end of this year. An agreement has been reached with the customs office that, starting next year, all ships must show their ship nationality certificates during inspections in order to pass. The original Ministry-issued licenses will no longer be valid.</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Residents Oppose Construction of Explosives Warehouse</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Office has purchased land in Laoshusha, Gaoqiao, to build an explosives warehouse. The local residents strongly oppose it, deeming it extremely dangerous. Yesterday, the municipal commissioner of the district, Zhong Yuliang, submitted a document to the municipal government stating that the residents of Gaoqiao Sha have repeatedly declared that they are shocked to learn that the Jianghai Customs Office has purchased land in Gaoqiao Sha to relocate the explosives warehouse. The entire Gaoqiao Sha area has already been designated as an oil pool area, and oil merchants are already building oil pools, which is already very dangerous. Now, the danger of the Jianghai Customs Office's explosives warehouse is many times greater than that of the oil pools. Even though the engineering precautions are very thorough, the nearby oil pools are very prone to fire. If an accident occurs, the explosives will easily explode. With two dangerous objects combined, the residents will have no chance of survival. Furthermore, Gaoqiao Sha has already been designated as an oil pool area, and other factories and warehouses are not allowed to be built there to avoid danger. How can an explosives warehouse, which is many times more dangerous, be built in the same area? What solution is there? The residents vow to oppose it to the death. Please forward this request to stop it. It is said that the location of the Jianghai Customs Office's explosives warehouse was originally unsuitable. In the summer of the 13th year of the Republic, the Jianghai Customs Office invited local gentry and oil merchants from Gaoqiao to discuss the location of the oil pools. At that time, it was requested that the explosives warehouse be moved to a remote location, but this was never implemented. Now, it is planned to relocate it to the oil pool area. Even a three-foot-tall child knows that this is extremely dangerous. I believe the mayor loves the people as if they were injured and will not approve it. Please issue a forceful ban to avoid danger. Reading the General Manager's plan for Greater Shanghai, in the future, ships will be moored, and the explosives warehouse will not be constructed south of Yunzaobang, as Yunzaobang is the boundary. Gaoqiao Sha is opposite Yunzaobang and should not be constructed there to avoid danger. Please consult with the Jianghai Customs Office to quickly find a remote location to relocate it to settle the matter once and for all.</p>
<h3>First District of County Submits Petition to Defer Repayment of Previously Borrowed Winter Grain</h3>
<p>The First District Public Office of the county, citing the severe disaster this year and the plight of the people, submitted a petition to the county government the other day, requesting the provincial government to defer the repayment of previously borrowed winter grain in order to relieve the people's suffering. The original petition to the county is recorded below: The petition concerns the matter of requesting a deferral. According to a proposal from Hua Bishu, the head of Yinghu Township, at the 93rd district affairs meeting of this district, the accumulated arrears of previously borrowed winter grain in Jiangsu Province amount to as much as 4 yuan and 5 jiao per shi. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the Department of Finance established a method for repayment in installments, with an annual repayment of 9 jiao per shi from the 19th year to the 23rd year, to be fully repaid in five years. This was approved by the provincial government committee and announced by the Department of Finance. However, the provincial government stated that the budget was insufficient for the amount due last year and ordered a deferral of the repayment. The district affairs meeting of this district discussed the matter and submitted a petition to the county government, requesting that the order for deferred repayment be withdrawn, but it was not approved. As a result, the people were greatly disappointed. This year, there have been wind and rain disasters, resulting in a poor autumn harvest. However, the provincial government only approved a general reduction of 7%, which is insufficient to offset the significant losses. In order to reduce the burden on the people and alleviate the disaster, the borrowed grain due for repayment in the 19th and 20th years, amounting to 1 yuan and 8 jiao per shi, should be allowed to be repaid according to the original plan in order to show good faith and alleviate the suffering of the people. The meeting discussed and resolved to submit a petition to the county government, requesting that the provincial government be allowed to issue a notice to all counties to implement the repayment, as it would be in the public interest.</p>
<h3>Patriotism Through Boycott: Promoting the Use of Domestically Produced Goods</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Jin Xiawen published his article "From the Patriotic Movement to the Common Clothes Movement" in this city, Mr. Wang Xinyuan of the Minyi Socks Factory in Touji Bridge, Zhejiang Road, responded by publishing an advertisement seeking "Friends of Common Clothes." Mr. Xu Ji'an and Mr. Wang Shipeng of the Dye Association initiated the improvement of Jiangyin cloth. The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Trade Association also published information on the production areas and sizes of Tonghai native cloth. The association's cloth is mostly handmade using traditional techniques from Tonghai. Tonghai was originally sandy soil, hence the name "Sand Cloth," which is actually native cloth. The raw material is all yarn spun from Dasheng Yarn Factory's twenty-count or lower yarn because the cotton produced in Tonghai can only be used to make coarse yarn of twenty-count or lower. Each piece of Sand Cloth is six feet long and one and a half feet wide. (Shanghai cloth) Each piece of cloth weighs four pounds for the heavier ones and three pounds for the lighter ones, and the price ranges from two yuan and up to three yuan. The names and addresses of the cloth shops that sell it are being printed and sent out by the association for patriotic individuals to purchase.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault on Yongxing Road</h3>
<p>Last night (Thursday) around 7:00 PM, five robbers suddenly appeared at the home of Yang Dezhong, a local resident, at No. 7, Shanguang Lane, Lane 894, Yongxing Road, Zhabei. Four of the robbers wore blue cloth short shirts and trousers, and one wore a gray long jacket, with a copper basin hat on his head. Among the other four robbers, three were bald, and one wore a peaked cap. At that time, the Yang family was having dinner when the five robbers broke in through the side door, each holding a pistol. They threatened silence and first searched Dezhong, taking away 127 yuan in cash and a gold ring from his hand. Then they drove the family members into one room, rummaged through boxes and chests, and took off the gold rings and earrings worn by Dezhong's daughter-in-law, Zhang, and granddaughter, Xiaozhen. As a result, they robbed over 140 yuan in cash (of which 20 yuan was taken from the bedside in Xiaozhen's room), two gold rings, a gold hairpin, a gray silk-faced leather robe, four woolen sweaters, one silk-cotton padded jacket and trousers each, one gabardine long gown, and three pieces of pink Indian silk embroidered clothing (commissioned by Westerners for embroidery), totaling about 600 yuan. During the robbery, Zhang tried to shout for help, but was injured in the chest, abdomen, and back of the hand by the robbers using the pistol butt. The injuries are serious and still bruised. Xiaozhen and others were also slapped in the face by the robbers. It is also known that before the robbery, a woman resembling a Jiangbei woman with a baby in her arms came to the lane to pretend to ask for directions, and then the robbers broke in. The above situation has already been reported by the victim to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau with a list of losses, requesting investigation and arrest. Chief Zhou of the district dispatched Inspector Ma Hualin along with detectives to the scene and confirmed the facts. The Fourth District ordered the detective team to solve the case, recover the stolen goods, and bring the perpetrators to the district for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Government Orders Provinces Not to Send Disaster Victims to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government has found that the floodwaters in various disaster areas have receded, and the city's work on accommodating disaster victims is planning to be completely concluded by the end of the month, with them being sent back to their original homes in batches. On the 30th, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries, commissions, provinces, and cities, asking them not to send disaster victims to Shanghai again. Now, a reply telegram has been received from the Executive Yuan, which has instructed the provincial governments to act accordingly. In addition, a telegram from the Capital Police Department stated that the department's measures regarding incoming disaster victims, after consultation with the Nanjing Municipal Government, have been submitted to the Executive Yuan, ordering provinces and cities to stop disaster victims from leaving their borders and ordering them to be accommodated locally. If there are still disaster victims coming to Nanjing, they will jointly with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Capital Flood Relief Association, provide funds to send them back to their hometowns or order them to go to the accommodation agencies established by the National Government in Linhuai Pass and Bengbu for relief. The relevant agencies in this city have been notified.</p>
<h3>The Benevolent Kings Protection of the Nation Dharma Assembly Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Benevolent Kings Protection of the Nation Dharma Assembly was held yesterday at 6:00 PM at the Gongdelin Temple. The audience was shoulder to shoulder, and those who arrived late regretted not being able to enter the room. Dharma Master Chi Song explained the essence of the Benevolent Kings Protection of the Nation with popular language. The Dharma sound was clear and everyone was delighted. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao and Mr. Wen Lanting respectfully offered incense. The temple was solemn and unprecedented. It is expected that there will be even more listeners today.</p>

<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>▲ Color Printing Industry: The Color Printing Industry Association held its 34th Executive Committee meeting yesterday to discuss the announcement to the public by the San Yi Printing Company, which had been removed from the association. It was generally agreed that the company's statement that the anti-Japanese aid-the-overseas-Chinese association's announcement only referred to those who had signed a contract and quickly returned the goods was different from the rubber stamp printing of the San Yi and even if it could be terminated, San Yi suffered a lot of losses, etc. The San Yi rubber stamp printing for the Japanese merchants was printed for the Japanese merchants, but printed for the San Yi. I don't know how the printed goods are different from the ordered goods. It is a strong argument to cover up the embarrassment. Moreover, in this patriotic movement, all sectors have sacrificed everything, but the San Yi is unwilling to lose a bit. If San Yi's behavior is correct, then the efforts of all sectors to carry out the patriotic movement, cancel the order, and seal up the existing goods are all superfluous. Moreover, in the company's announcement to all sectors, it still tried its best to praise the Japanese rubber company's scale, complete equipment, and low fees, which is truly heartless to insult our country's printing industry. As for the statement that the association's general meeting decided to use the raising-hands method instead of the voting method, the chairman made the final decision to use the raising-hands method for voting. Representatives of the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were present to testify. Moreover, according to the provisions of the initial stage of civil rights, this resolution should have adopted the raising-hands method. After discussion, it was decided to ignore it. Subsequently, other important motions were discussed and decided.</p>
<p>▲ Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry: Since Cheng Yujie of Ren Dachang and others initiated the organization of the Chinese and Foreign Grocery Industry Association, preparations have been going on for several months.

It will also be submitted to the party and government agencies and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and personnel will be sent to attend and guide.</p>
<p>▲ Sand Transport Industry: After the Municipal Party Headquarters issued the Permit No. 34 to the Hook Boat Sand Transport Industry Association, the first sponsors' meeting was convened yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM.

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Yangtze River basin and the Shandong coastal area were cloudy with signs of change. There was a cyclone in northeastern China, caused by a low pressure passing through and moving southeast-east. There were northwest to northeast winds in the East China Sea. The weather in northern Zha Le was bad, caused by a hurricane moving northwest. The center of the hurricane was within 60 miles of the intersection of 14 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude around 6:00 AM this morning. Also, within 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 69.3 degrees and the lowest was 38.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 58.8 degrees and the lowest was 48.0 degrees.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I read in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 6th of this month about the First Special Court Violations Tribunal ordering Ye Shaofen to be sent to the Jiliang Shelter for Care. The facts stated are slightly different from the truth. It has been found that the prostitutes in the jurisdiction of this court have become more and more rampant recently. Although they have been severely punished, the effect is minimal. In order to eliminate them, it is planned to send those who are forced to sell themselves to charitable organizations such as the Jiliang Shelter for care by virtue of their powers. I feel that it is necessary to contact the staff of the shelter. Therefore, after the adjournment of the court, in front of the door of the dressing room, I called the Chinese and Western staff of the shelter's general office and talked for three or four minutes. The previous report was inaccurate. Please correct it as soon as possible. Yours sincerely, Shen Shanzeng, Judge of the Violations Tribunal of the Shanghai Special District Local Court, November 7.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, According to Ma Wanyao and Ma Bosun, on the 5th of this month, your newspaper's local news, "Wu Boyou is Sued for Being Bitten by a Dog," stated that "the owner laughed while letting the dog bite people." After investigation, it was found that it was inconsistent with the facts. The medical practitioner has no reason to hate and has no reason to let the dog bite the person who comes to see the doctor. Moreover, after the dog bit the person, it is unreasonable to laugh instead of scolding. It is known that the report in your newspaper is based on the plaintiff's statement and is not your newspaper's conclusion. It can be defended without much argument. However, for fear that outsiders will not understand and pass on false information, I hereby entrust a representative to send a letter for correction. I respectfully request your newspaper to correct it immediately, or include this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section. I hope you will check and implement it. It is a real friendship. Yours sincerely, Wen Chao, 20, 11, 7, to the editor-in-chief of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read in your newspaper on the 4th of this month a telegram from various party members to Wang Cai, in which the wording was slightly dissatisfied with Mr. Hu Hanmin's attitude, and the last name was listed as Lu Guanqun, and I was also listed. I was very surprised to read it. I have never heard of this telegram before, and I have not met Lu Guanqun and others for a long time. How can I falsely publish my claims? It is extremely hateful. I am writing to your newspaper specifically to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth and correct the views. I am not responsible for the telegram. Yours sincerely, Tang Yiyu, a party member from Jiading County, November 6, Year 20.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read the news in your newspaper's "Local News" column yesterday about the "Xin Jiang Tian Japanese Goods Incident," which briefly stated that "the tea room staff on the China Merchants Bureau's Xin Jiang Tian ship smuggled more than 220 pieces of Japanese salted fish when it went from Shanghai to Ningbo last time, which caused a riot in which Japanese goods inspectors were beaten." I was shocked after reading it. Since the Northeast Incident, our association has organized an anti-Japanese and national salvation committee, and has strict punishment methods for members who buy, sell, and smuggle Japanese goods. The Eastern fish on the ship this time was transported by 11 fish shops in Ningbo Hengtai Tongfuchang, etc., and has nothing to do with the tea room staff. This matter concerns the reputation of our association and all workers, so I am writing to ask for correction. Yours sincerely, the Shanghai Huning Steamer Tea Room Workers Union, November 7, to the editor-in-chief of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>A letter from a Westerner named Neugebauer of Taylor Foreign Firm stated, "Dear Sir, Yesterday, your newspaper reported that the Grand Champagne first prize in the Autumn Horse Race was won by a Chinese employee of our firm in his 60s. After investigation, it was found that the champagne ticket was not purchased by an employee of our firm. It was only sold by me. Outsiders then spread the rumor that the actual winner was a Chinese whom I did not know, who currently resides in Ningbo. I dare to ask you to correct this. I am very grateful. Yours sincerely, Da Jian to the Editor-in-Chief."</p>
<p>Dear Sir, According to the reports in various newspapers today, my speech at the Hehui representative office yesterday contained the statement "In the past, the warlord Wu Peifu, after his defeat, still thought it was laughable to seek refuge in the concessions," which made me speechless. I can still remember what I said at that time as follows: "Although Mr. Wang just said that there has been a precedent for holding meetings in Shanghai for sixteen years, it is still within the scope of imperialism. If the Hehui is delayed or even has no results, that is still very bad." There was not a word about Wu Peifu. Mr. Wang's reply did have the words "This is Wu Peifu's opinion. We revolutionaries don't know it," but this cannot be used to strongly conclude that my speech must have involved Wu Peifu first and changed his words. Also, in the record of Mr. Wang's reply, there are the words "Mr. Shen said that at a time of internal and external troubles, it is ridiculous to hold a meeting in Shanghai instead of Nanjing, and to hold a meeting in the concessions." I did not say "do not enter Nanjing" at that time, and the wording and attitude of "how ridiculous" were not like that at all. The colleagues who went with me yesterday, after meeting today, all felt injustice and were willing to testify unanimously. I am not afraid of offending Mr. Wang, but I do not want people to say that I praise Wu Peifu. Therefore, I believe that this point in today's newspapers is absolutely wrong and must be corrected. I have attached a copy of the letter I sent to Mr. Wang yesterday, and I hope it will be published in the newspaper to correct the views. I am deeply grateful. Yours sincerely, Shen Junru, November 7.</p>
<p>The attached letter from Shen to Wang is as follows: To the right of Mr. Jingwei, I have not received your teachings for a long time. I recently followed the colleagues of various private universities to visit the representatives. Mr. You made some statements. Under the enthusiastic hope and the pressure of time, it is inevitable that there are excessive words. However, putting my tongue and heart on the line, there is absolutely no other meaning mixed in. I can swear it. I did not expect to cause Mr. You to misunderstand and point out that You's words were specifically for Mr. You, resulting in serious accusations such as "This is Wu Peifu's opinion" and "I am not afraid of being intimidated by diplomacy." Moreover, the expression was excited, which made the listeners uneasy. After returning home, I was unhappy all day. I wonder if Mr. You's nerves have been stimulated too much in recent days, or if he has been influenced by preconceived notions, so he immediately reacted when touched. For four or five years, You has lived in Shanghai, running a school and working as a lawyer. My footprints do not involve the capital, which is known to my friends. I do not want to be suspected of being a gentleman because of occasional rough words. I am sending this special message, and I respectfully hope that you will understand. Yours sincerely, Shen Junru, evening of November 6.</p>

<h3>Memories of Dai Liang</h3>
<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>Since Liaodong was occupied by the Japanese bandits, all Chinese people have been indignant. Recalling before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the eastern neighbor had long harbored the ambition to swallow up our country. I have heard and seen things with my own eyes, and I write them down. It can also be seen that the disaster is not just beginning now.</p>
<p>▲ Ito Hirobumi's Arrogant Words</p>
<p>In the early years of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, Ito traveled by sea and liked to associate with literati. My teacher, Mr. Gu Qiuyan, and Tiannan Dunsuo Gao Chang, Hanshi Sheng Shen Zuomeng, Wan Sheng, etc., held literary banquets. Ito was often invited. He sang and wrote poetry at the banquet, which was very popular for a while. Mr. Gu wrote a poem on a certain gentleman washing his feet in Fusang (Japan), with a concluding sentence saying, "Don't you see that a flute blows out the waves of Korea, and a sword cuts flat the island of Japan?" Ito was very impressed when he saw it, and then sent a post to visit Mr. Gu as a disciple. They often visited each other. One night, after drinking, Ito said to Mr. Gu, "In less than ten years, our country will do something to China." At that time, those who heard it did not pay attention to it. It was not until the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 that they knew that the Japanese had made up their minds long ago. They leaked it after drinking, and could not help themselves. Who said that the Japanese had no deep intentions?</p>

<h3>The Power of 100,000 Letters</h3>
<p>After the Ning-Yue Representative Conference was suspended, someone in the education sector advocated that 100,000 students, elementary school students, middle school students, and university students, should each write a letter to the Representative Conference requesting peaceful reunification and jointly resisting foreign aggression. This is a very interesting invention. What caught my attention in this invention was the speculation on the number.</p>
<p>If every student followed the instructions of this inventor and wrote a letter, and every letter was sent to Wugongguan on Gordon Road, then Wugongguan must prepare two hundred tables today to respectfully receive these letters.</p>
<p>Because the foreign troubles are very urgent, the representatives cannot wait to extract the reasons for the letters, and they will read them as soon as they arrive, so as not to delay. These representatives are all important party and state officials. Over the years, they have been reading official documents very quickly. For such important letters, even if they have the ability to read ten lines at a glance, it would be impossible to spend less than one minute reading each letter, including opening it. 100,000 letters would take 100,000 minutes to read. The normal work is eight hours a day. Now, to speed up the work, it is estimated that it will take twelve hours. Then, reading these letters will take at least 141 days. If you ask the representatives why they have not quickly and peacefully reunified, they can answer that we have not read the letters you sent. After we read your letters, we will definitely do as you say. Please wait for our reply on March 27 next year.</p>
<h3>Memories of Japan Seizing Forest Products</h3>
<p>— Li Xu Fan</p>
<p>The Japanese bandits seized our Northeast forest products, and their intention has been more than a day. I am saddened that our country has many accidents and always ignores them. Even if negotiations are opened, they are always delayed and accommodated. As a result, the forests of the Northeast have long been loaded and left. Yesterday, I read in the newspaper that the Japanese army was bombarding the Black Province again. I could not help but split my eyes. I happened to recall the past and recorded it to tell the readers. During the late Qing Dynasty Guangxu period, Zhou Shumo was the governor of the Black Province. He saw that the forest products in the Jilin Province were rich and planned to collect and transport them into the customs. The method was very good. He ordered his staff to investigate, and Huang Xingyuan planned everything. He asked for permission to exploit. In the next autumn, he engaged in logging, which was a lot of business. At that time, transportation was inconvenient and transportation was difficult. It was necessary to cross the Yalu River to reduce the journey into the customs. Fortunately, the first batch reached the customs and was sold all over the northern provinces. Timber merchants believed that the quality was strong, the length was long, and the trunks were thick, round, and straight, which was better than the fir and pine imported from other places. Soon, they were sold out. Unexpectedly, when the second batch was loaded and crossed the Yalu River, it had already been detected by the Japanese. The warships prevented the transport and forcibly seized the wooden rafts. The Qing government was weak and incompetent, and the negotiations were ineffective. From then on, the good forests were not only difficult for us to transport by water, but also the right to continue mining had been seized early. Zhou Yi had no way to recover it and spent tens of thousands of yuan in vain. Soon after, Zhou was also withdrawn because of thorny diplomatic issues. Huang also resigned and returned to Wumen. When I met him in a certain year and talked about the past, he was still sobbing. It can be seen that 30 years ago, the Japanese bandits had actually invaded and occupied our Eastern Province's interests. This time, the authorities did not resist the military occupation of the Eastern Province. Are they afraid of their preemptive strike, or do they have other good strategies? It is difficult to understand. I urge the ruling officials to quickly decide on peaceful talks and unite against Japan to avoid the disaster of destruction.</p>
<h3>Hidden Reefs in the Future of Domestic Aircraft</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Fudetian, an editor at the Automobile Translation Agency, specializes in automobile mechanics. In recent years, he has also been studying aircraft science. Therefore, starting this spring, he has sacrificed his inherent business and devoted himself to the manufacture of aircraft. The engine is a modified one used in automobiles. The rest of the materials are all domestically produced. For several months, he has declined everything and worked day and night to build it himself. He is also trying to do it alone. After the National Government Aviation Conference in May of this year, he began manufacturing it. It took half a year, and it was finally completed at the end of last month. According to the structure of the aircraft, it is completely modeled on the American 1930 single-seater light aircraft as the standard. The engine is a modified air-cooled four-cylinder "Hunterson" motorcycle engine. Most of the other materials are made in China first. It is especially difficult to select materials such as cloth paint. It is said that Mr. Zhang has been running around for almost a month to negotiate the test flight site, but he has no confidence. All the major aviation institutions in this port, such as the China Aviation Corporation and the Hongqiao Aircraft Factory, have requested assistance, but the results have been rejected. Therefore, Mr. Zhang is very disappointed. Especially during this half-year manufacturing period, all the business and economic losses have been unsubsidized. If he invests in renting a test site again, it will be even more difficult. I sincerely hope that the universities in this port are willing to help with the playground so that he can succeed as soon as possible. Otherwise, Mr. Zhang is afraid that when he is forced to do so, he will transfer the entire aircraft to foreigners who like to study this way and continue to make progress in order to achieve final success. However, I do not know if the aviation authorities have a way to remedy it.</p>

<h3>Autumn Notes from Plum Garden</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>Since spring this year, I have not set foot in the mountains and lakes. Confined by illness and sorrow, I have missed much of the beautiful scenery. Last Sunday, my host, Rong Degong, invited me to go to Plum Garden by car. It was my first outing this year. White clouds were in the sky, and yellow leaves covered the ground. Several maple forests were faintly reddish, like a beauty after illness, trying on makeup for the first time. The garden has the most chrysanthemums. They are already in bloom. The gardeners select those with tall stems and lush branches, plant them in large pots, and weave their flowers into dozens of blooms, forming a flat, round shape, towering like a canopy. Although it is the result of artificial manipulation, it is still enough to enhance the flowers' beauty. They are arranged in front of the Songbin Hall, where we enjoyed tea, unable to distinguish between the fragrance of tea and flowers. In addition, there are still many buds yet to bloom in the flower beds, just like what the ancients called "the best time to see flowers is when they are half open." Degong looked at me and asked with a smile if I still had the strength to climb to the summit. I said I could. So, we went hand in hand up the steps to the highest point of the mountain, where a newly built golf course was located. I am weak and not fond of playing. When I studied at Nan Jing, I never participated in school sports. Therefore, I am a complete layman when it comes to ball games. However, Degong took the initiative to guide me, explaining in detail the starting and ending points of the ball and its passage through the squares and lines, as if Huang Chengyan was guiding Lu Xun in the Eight Trigrams Formation. It was both surprising and shameful. On that day, the sky was high and the air was clear, and the view stretched for miles. The calm lake was like a mirror, with light shining on the sky. The mountains on the water were arranged like a painting. Distant sails appeared and disappeared in the misty waves, mingling with the seagulls. The beauty of autumn was breathtaking. Soon, several tourists arrived, chanting poems. Among them was my old friend, Wu Junshouzhen, who came from Biling yesterday. We shook hands happily and exchanged pleasantries. However, he was in a hurry to return, so we only had a few words before parting, promising to meet later. On the way down the mountain, we passed by the Zongjing Villa. I suddenly remembered my old friend, Xie Jiezhi, who had recuperated here in the autumn of the past. He invited literary friends from Shanghai, such as Haoran, Xishen, and Shoujuan, to enjoy the scenery and write poems. It was a grand occasion for a time. I often frequented the place, enjoying myself without getting tired. Since Jiezhi's death, I have had a feeling of the wind scattering and the clouds dispersing. Today, passing by the old place again, how can I not feel heartache? Having mourned the deceased, I reflect on myself. On the way home, I could not help but feel sad after the joy had faded.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Double Cross Society</h3>
<p>— Chong Zhi</p>
<p>▲ One of the Methods to Save the Country</p>
<p>The Japanese devils are inherently wolves. This time, taking advantage of the simultaneous disasters of drought and flood, they used their gangster tactics to trample on our four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. Using guns, cannons, airplanes, and bombs, they placed our 30 million compatriots in Northeast China under the state of subjugated slaves, resulting in losses of countless millions. Alas, how painful! Since the May 3rd Jinan Incident and the recent Wanbaoshan Incident, after massacring our innocent compatriots, we have suffered this catastrophe again. Resisting Japan and saving the country is something we should never forget.</p>
<p>In the past, when Yue was defeated by Wu, King Goujian of Yue endured hardship and humiliation, eventually avenging his past shame. The Double Cross Society, as the name suggests, takes the example of ten years of accumulation and ten years of education. Resisting Japan and saving the country, we will never be a five-minute fad. We will uphold the glory of the founding of the Republic on the Double Tenth Festival of the Xinhai Year. Starting from this year, the twentieth year of the Republic of China, we will continue the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs for the next twenty years, striving to eliminate the unequal treaties as a fundamental task until there is no so-called national humiliation. Alas, the national crisis has arrived. All my comrades, seeing what is right, act bravely. Why not come forward? (Temporary correspondence for the preparatory office can be forwarded to Shi Chongzhi, Shanghai Post Office Box 938.)</p>
<p>▲ Correction: Yesterday's zinc plate title "Saying Department Rotary Club" and the title "Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Fu Tan Hui" were mistakenly arranged during plating. They should be swapped. Also, in the previous "Ti Xiang Zhai Cheng Ying Tan" article, in Shi Zhaoji's section, "Chen Lu" was mistaken for "Chen Jin." In Tang Shaoyi's section, "Gong Qing" was mistaken for "Gong Xiang." In the sentence "Fu Ming Suo Qin Dai Dian Ju," "Suo Qin" was mistaken for "Bu Shi." The last sentence "Jian Zhe Yi Wei Xiang Qu Ye" was missing the two characters "Jian Zhe." Combined correction.</p>

<h3>A Countryman Visits Shanghai Again (10)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Of course, the countryman is full of curiosity. In the third-class carriage, he finds everything strange. He is not willing to sleep with his arms and legs stretched out like that detective. He also heard people say: You can't sleep in the train, because there are too many pickpockets in the train. If you are not careful, they will steal from you, so he doesn't dare to sleep.</p>
<p>He saw people in yellow clothes squeezing in and out of the train. But those people in yellow clothes were different from those seen in the station. They all had a triangular red cloth wrapped around their arms. The countryman guessed that they must be going to a wedding banquet. He knew that in the past, mourning was worn on the hair, but since the braids were cut off, many people wear mourning on their arms. Wrapping a piece of black cloth on the arm is considered mourning. Then, according to this reasoning, wrapping a piece of red cloth on the arm, doesn't it mean a celebration, going to a wedding banquet?</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that the wedding banquet friends who wrapped red cloth around their arms all had a box hanging around their waists. This box is neither square nor round, neither oblique nor upright, and there is a tuft of red beard outside. What is it? The countryman thought for a long time, looking at its shape, it seems like a water pipe box. He thought: That's right! They all smoke water pipes. Presumably, the wedding banquet people did not prepare so many water pipes, so they all brought their own. Nowadays, the trend is to smoke cigarettes at every turn, and even women hold a cigarette in their mouths. No one asks about water pipes anymore. Now there are still these wedding banquet friends who smoke water pipes, and they even bring their own water pipes, which can be regarded as enthusiastically promoting domestic goods.</p>
<p>He wanted to confirm whether his thinking was correct, so he asked a spectacle-wearing gentleman sitting diagonally opposite him: "Is there a pair of water pipes in this box? The beard on the water pipe is still exposed outside the box, which is also a new style now."</p>
<p>"Is it a water pipe? Do you want to smoke a puff of water pipe? I guarantee that after you smoke this puff of water pipe, you will never want to smoke a second puff of water pipe," the spectacle-wearing gentleman replied to the countryman with a funny and cunning expression, and laughed coldly.</p>
<p>"Why will I never want to smoke a second puff?" The countryman wanted to ask the reason in confusion, only to hear a distant sound of "Resist, resist, no resistance, don't move, don't move, really don't move," and the train had already entered the station.</p>
<p>What is the sound of "Resist, resist, no resistance"? It turned out to be the sound of a blowing bugle.</p>
<p>What is the sound of "Don't move, don't move, really don't move"? It turned out to be the sound of a drum.</p>
<h3>Records of Things Seen and Heard in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>▲ Taoran Pavilion</p>
<p>During the Kangxi period, Jiang Zao, a bureaucrat of the Ministry of Works, built a pavilion next to Longshu Temple in the south of the city. It was called Taoran. Later generations used his surname as the name, calling it Jiang Pavilion. Other desolate smoke covered hundreds of acres, with undulating slopes. Extending the scenery and making the heart feel real, it has the charm of seeing the vastness of the rivers and lakes. Especially in late autumn, when the reeds are lush and the white dew turns to frost, it makes people forget that they are inside the imperial city. In the past, many officials and nobles gathered in the south of the city. The streets and alleys in the south of the city were narrow and blocked, with the most mixed dust. If you wanted to go to Shichahai and other places to see the scenery of the liquid pool, it would take a whole day. The bureaucrats in Beijing suffered from this. Therefore, the pavilion was clear, open, and unique, not far from the market. Whenever there was a banquet, they would use it to prepare the dishes. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, Pan Wenqin and Zhang Wenxiang held grand banquets here for famous scholars. Because they were both hosts, they shirked responsibility to each other, and the dishes were not prepared properly, causing great laughter. The Xiangqilou poetry collection has a poem that sings about the events of that day. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, there was a sound like a cow in the marsh next to the pavilion for several days in a row. It was rumored that a water monster was in charge of the army. In fact, it was a pelican. "The pelican is on the beam," which is enough to satirize those in high positions. After the Guangxu period, many bureaucrats in Beijing lived in the inner city, and the gatherings at Jiang Pavilion became rare. After the Republic of China, the Altar of Soil and Grains and Beihai were successively opened as gardens. The officials and nobles liked to gather and hated loneliness. The old stories of the capital have gradually been forgotten. No one visits this cold smoke and wild water anymore. In the winter of the Xinyou year, I once drove a car to the place. It was a dilapidated mound, and the pavilion was about to collapse. Cobwebs were everywhere. The caretakers set up a tea stall to pray for guests, but no one cared. Looking around desolately, the peaceful pastimes seemed to be still in front of me. The pavilion is best known for its autumn scenery, so there is a mound next to the pavilion called Jinqiu Mound. Every year on the Double Ninth Festival, some enthusiasts still pretend to climb to a high place. People in the northern capital attach great importance to this festival. On this day, the shops sell Double Ninth Festival cakes. There are two kinds of cakes. One is made of sugar and flour, with fine fruits sandwiched in the middle, in two or three layers, which is the better kind of cake. The other is steamed buns dotted with dates and chestnuts, which is the second best.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Hovering and Slightly Rising</h3>
<p>▲ Two Zero Customs Consolidated Salt Tax Increased by About 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (7th), the various bond markets of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the spot market was very clear, only the demobilization opened in the morning, and there were no other transactions. The futures market was flat as before, and large households still had no large transactions. The market in and out was scattered, trapped in a hovering state, and there was no large rise or fall, but zero households took in at low prices, quite restless. The morning opening was consistent and rebounded, such as the consolidated tax, salt tax, two zero customs, etc., all rose by more than one yuan. The secondary market slightly returned to fatigue, but the after-market was more prosperous by the buyers, and the recovery trend was firm, but the rise and fall remained peaceful. As a result, the consolidated tax in November rose by 2 yuan, and the December futures for salt tax and two zero customs each rose by 1.45 yuan. Also, the demobilization in October also rose by 1.2 yuan, and others were only good for 4 or 5 jiao. The bond market situation is still extremely depressing, and its trend will depend on the development of the diplomatic situation for change. It is estimated that only 2,000 yuan was traded in the spot market, and more than 5.6 million in the futures market in the morning market and about 3.89 million in the after-market, totaling more than 9.4 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower Yarn Market Has Not Escaped Weakness</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still poor, the situation is very weak, because the situation is not stable, the finance is depleted, people's hearts are extremely tired, and there are large households throwing out, manufacturers slightly hedging, the market is weaker, the current yarn Tianjin Gang is more active, the current environment is bad, it is difficult to turn around,</p>
<p>▲ More Sellers in the Bidding Before Opening: The opening market was in poor shape, with more sellers in the market. Each fell 3, 6, 7, or 8 yuan. In the afternoon, some scattered households took profits and supplemented, and each rose 1, 2, 4, or 5 yuan. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 24,000 bales. It was found that Yicheng sold 1,350 bales, Mingde 850 bales, and Shenxin 500 bales. Changfeng bought 1,000 bales, Yiyu 900 bales, and Jifeng 800 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>January 1582 285,900 April 1580 226,650</p>
<p>▲ The Actual Sales are Slightly Improving: The actual yarn sales are still good. It was found that all the gangs bought a total of 1,250 bales throughout the day, and 85 bales were entered into the same industry. The market is very tired. Among the customer gangs, Shantou entered 200 bales, Tianjin entered 775 bales, the mainland entered 90 bales, Guangdong entered 50 bales, and Miscellaneous gangs entered 85 bales. Yihé issued 20 5-Fu Shepherd, priced at 176 taels and 5 mace, deducting commissions, 3,000 bales, 1 or 2 month period cleared, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Follows U.S. Cotton in Stabilizing</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly stable because U.S. cotton prices rose slightly, which stabilized buyers' sentiment. Moreover, most buyers believed that the source of local cotton was insufficient, and the intention to short-squeeze had not been completely abandoned, so the pulling force was very strong. However, the silver price soared, making the foreign cotton price increasingly cheaper, so imports continued to increase. The New Wing On No. 2 Factory purchased a huge amount of 30,000 bales of U.S. cotton. Future trading in local cotton is quite disappointing, so judging from the overall situation, it is difficult to maintain stability.</p>
<p>▲Scattered Households on the Han Standard Market Squeeze the Han Standard Market. At the opening of the market, the atmosphere was still calm, with prices for each month being level. In the afternoon, as the gold price rose slightly, scattered households squeezed the market, and prices for each month rose slightly by 1.5 to 2 mace. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 67,300 piculs. It was found that Taixing sold 2,400 piculs, Yichang 1,800 piculs, Yiyu 1,300 piculs, Mingde 1,900 piculs, Hengyi 1,500 piculs, Jifeng bought 1,000 piculs, Daji 1,600 piculs, Gengfeng 1,800 piculs, and Tianlong 1,000 piculs.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Buying Appetite Strengthens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton buying appetite strengthened due to reactionary buying and Wall Street strength. Buyers were enthusiastic, and the market was firm and active. Futures rose 9 to 15 points, spot prices rose 15 points. British cotton futures fell 89 points, spot prices fell 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to sales by European exporters and brokers, and the closing was quiet and firm. Pingor rose 0.75 rupees, Omra fell 0.25 rupees, and Bailoxi fell 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 6th).</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Presents a Mixed and Stagnant Picture</h3>
<p>▲Cooperatives Close Out Futures Purchases of New Cotton</p>
<p>New York telegram dated 6th reports on the cotton market situation for the week: The cotton market this week is mixed and lacks activity, and there is a tendency to wait for developments. Equalizing buying and selling occurs slightly, waiting for the release of the government cotton production report on Sunday. Grain and silver prices are firm, so people buy when cotton prices fall, but the South sells when cotton prices rise, and many parties also close out positions. Cooperatives have converted their contracts for futures purchased last year to offset their spot cotton sales into actual transactions, that is, closing out futures and purchasing new cotton in the South. This action puts some pressure on the futures market but also helps maintain the value of spot goods. The weather this week continues to be good, suitable for cotton picking everywhere. Private estimates of cotton production range from about 15,250,000 bales to 16,700,000 bales, all slightly more than last month. However, many cotton merchants still doubt whether the change in cotton production estimates, in addition to temporarily distracting the industry from the market prices in the South and the development of general trade, will have a greater impact. There were fewer sales this week.</p>

<h3>Grain and Imported Long-Grain Rice are the Most Stable, New Japonica Rice is Slightly Looser</h3>
<p>▲The market atmosphere for merchants was very good yesterday. There were still many people in the market in the morning, making the situation difficult to grasp. New japonica rice arrived vigorously but had a soft corner. Sales of old and broken rice were sluggish, and the situation remained flat. The supply of Baige and late-season rice was limited. Traders in this street selected high-quality rice and took slightly more. Although the appetite for Ningbo rice moved, it was extremely flat. The market situation for Guangdong rice was not prosperous. Although sales of reed-tip rice turned flat, it was still stable due to the scarcity of goods. The arrival of imported long-grain rice was scarce, and the market situation was also tight. Not much silver was received. Wine merchants suppressed prices, about a few cents short of the original price. Due to the sharp drop in the gold price for imported rice, people's hearts were weak, and both futures and spot transactions were less. The market price fell again.</p>
<p>▲The rice market in Xinzha yesterday has not yet become smooth, because the market situation in the west road is deserted, and there is a slight inventory in this street. River goods are difficult to revitalize. The opening in the morning was only a little. The way out is difficult to improve. Changshu japonica rice fell by a dime. The middle gate is settled. New thin rice and red rice still have not returned to stability. The color of Doyang long-grain rice is close to loose. The market buying of standard rice in this street is not weak, and prices are stable. Yin-transformed goods are sluggish and difficult to sell, falling by about four or five dimes. The opening price of He Xia Hubei was 3,000 piculs.</p>
<h3>Recycled Imported Rice is Offered at 12 Cents Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the small settlement of imported rice futures was due to foreign firms not throwing out goods, and people's hearts were hopeful. Recycled goods were offered at 12 cents higher. However, Saigon had Jinlong throwing out 500 tons of No. 1 rice for immediate loading, priced at only 5.4 taels, which was a little less expensive. Spot goods have been sluggish for many days, and only about 5,000 bags were opened for sale yesterday after depreciating by about a dime. Various rice types including small settlement rice and Saigon No. 1 rice, Saigon No. 1 rice at $11.60 to $11.47, and small settlement rice at $10.01 to $10.0178, were all handled by this street, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Falls Back 3 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a trend of fatigue and decline again. The quotations for foreign wheat varied by 35 cents. The agitation of people's hearts was actually due to the small step in the gold price and the long release of the exchange rate. The combined price of foreign wheat was also approaching. Although the Dong Province issue has not recovered, generally active factories have heard that they have allocated activities again, and there are many people who have been inquiring about foreign wheat for days. Therefore, people's hearts have suddenly changed. Moreover, small factories are selling, and the far term is greatly hit. Observing the subsequent steps, if the gold market is not stable, the market atmosphere will still look fatigued. As a result, this month fell 1.5 cents from the previous day, December fell 1.25 cents, January fell 2.75 cents, February fell 2.25 cents, March fell 2 cents, and April fell 3 cents, it is said.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Wheat Bulls Sell Off Frenziedly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market, the market for each month showed a consistent trend of continuous decline. The quotations for foreign wheat fluctuated up and down, but after the sharp fall in the gold market, the hearts of people inside and outside the industry changed again. The good reason is that the exchange rate is increasing day by day, and foreign wheat can still be ordered. If so, the future volume of goods will not be alarming. The atmosphere in the market is entirely determined by whether foreign wheat can continue to be ordered. In the near term, because factories still have needs, it is still stable. In the far term, there are more increases, and most of the back out of the market is very soft. Observing the subsequent steps, it still looks fatigued. As a result, this month is unchanged, December fell 4 cents from the previous day, January and February fell 4 cents, March fell 5 cents, and April fell 6 cents, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea New York Silk Futures Market Price Reports Increase</h3>
<p>▲Futures sales are initiated... Prices for near and far term silk each increase by several cents</p>
<p>Recently, although sales of finished silk in New York have not improved, the appetite of hoarders for silk futures has turned smooth. The market price of silk futures on the exchange has suddenly tended to be firm and increase. Shanghai white factory silk has increased by 67 cents per pound, and the far term has increased by 89 cents, it is said.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Longkou Vermicelli Fall with Land Prices</h3>
<p>Longkou glass noodles and dried vermicelli have recently seen a relaxation in land prices, and customer purchases have decreased accordingly. More than a hundred packages were once offered at 23.5 taels, but now various companies have no intention to purchase at the original price, and there is a possibility of continued decline. An expanded telegram reports that land prices have decreased by more than two taels, and the market in this area has also turned fatigued due to this. Yesterday, the market sold for 23.56 taels. If customer purchases weaken again, they will still have to fall accordingly. Judging from the land price situation, it is still difficult for the market to stand firm.</p>
<h3>Metals Soften Due to Excessive Easing in the Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange loosened excessively, causing the various metal markets to soften as a result. British copper plates were sold yesterday for 8.25 taels (2.5 li), 6.25 taels (0.5 fen), 5.45 taels (7.5 li), and 5.25 taels (1 fen), all of which fell by 2.5 cents compared to the previous day. No. 16 to No. 20 new lead wire was sold for 12.8 taels, which was also 2 cents lower than before. Yuan nails were sold for 8.4 taels, 1 cent lower. White iron tiles, brass wire, as well as new iron wire and tape iron, all tended to be cheaper. However, actual transactions remained weak, so the future market trend is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Coal Datong Lump Coal Selling Price Follows Increase</h3>
<p>▲Increased by 5 cents compared to last week</p>
<p>Since the price of Kaiping coal screened lumps increased a few days ago due to a shortage of goods, the prices of various bituminous coal lumps have tended to increase. Datong coal lumps have also seen a greater increase in market prices due to a large reduction in coal stocks. Yesterday's market price was called up to 17.25 taels per ton, an increase of about 5 cents compared to the market price last week, it is said.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Introducing Several Books on Japan's Invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia (Continued)</h3>
<p>Zhang Fei</p>
<p>(2) Japan's Railway Invasion of the Three Eastern Provinces by Lin Tongji, published by Huatong Bookstore</p>
<p>This book provides a comprehensive analysis of Japan's railway operations in the Eastern Provinces over the past 20 years or so. At the same time, it points out the cause and effect of the economic and political invasion of the Eastern Provinces by Japanese imperialism and specifically states that Japan's motive for "developing Manchuria and Mongolia" is entirely the alias of Meiji's "destroying Manchuria and Mongolia" and the latest means of Showa's "destroying Manchuria and Mongolia." Although the materials cited in this book mostly come from foreign books, I believe that young people who want to study how Manchuria and Mongolia have been ravaged by Japanese imperialism should at least read this book.</p>
<p>The book is divided into six chapters and fifty-two sections, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1: General Introduction | An overview of the period of state-run railways, the significance of Chinese wars, the operation of Russian (Imperial Russian) railways, the intrusion of Japanese forces, and its state of railway operation in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: South Manchuria Railway Company and its managed railways | This chapter discusses the overview of the development of railways in the three eastern provinces after the Russo-Japanese War, the relationship between the South Manchuria Railway Company and Japan's policy towards Manchuria, the politicization of the South Manchuria Railway Company's organization and its rapid capital increase, the issue of railway guards and police, and the occupation of railway boundaries and land.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Sino-Japanese Jointly Operated Railways | Discusses Japan's railway loan policy, the cult of Dalian and its implementation, the expansion of Japan's interests in Northeast China and the Jilin-Huining Railway issue, Japan's demand to transform the Jilin-Dunhua Railway contract and the Jilin-Dunhua Road extension issue, the Jilin-Huining Road and Japan's national policy, and Japan's conspiracy to build a major Inner Mongolia trunk road.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Japan and Chinese Self-Operated Railways | Discusses the transportation of Chinese railway management in the three eastern provinces, the issue of the New Law Railway and Japan's destruction, and the revival of Chinese self-operated railways.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Japan and the Chinese Eastern Railway | Discusses the Siberian Expedition and various perspectives of Japan's attempt to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, the competition between the Chinese Eastern and South Manchuria Railways, and Japan's policy of forcing the division of the railways northward.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: A General Observation of Japan's Invasion of the Three Eastern Provinces | Summarizes the relationship between Japan's railway operations in the three eastern provinces and its Manchurian and Mongolian policies, Japan's grand plan to "develop" the eastern provinces, the unification of various Japanese agencies invading the eastern provinces, and Japan's special interests in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>The main difference between this book and the previous one is that it is more horizontally arranged and less vertically analyzed. I think that when studying a certain issue, it is best to start from the vertical first and then the horizontal. Historical clarity can help with the understanding of comprehensive or individual things and can determine the theoretical basis. Therefore, the reason why this book must be read after reading the previous one is just like that.</p>
<p>(3) Manchuria and Mongolia Under Japanese Influence for Twenty Years</p>
<p>Edited by Chen Jing, Shanghai Huatong Bookstore</p>
<p>This book comparatively uses scientific methods to study the nature, number of people, methods, and regions of Japanese imperialism's colonization of Manchuria and Mongolia over the past 20 years. That is, it takes Japan's colonial policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia as the object of study. At the same time, it also takes Japan's politics, economy, transportation, culture in Manchuria and Mongolia, and the results of the application of Japanese colonial policy, that is, various forms of Manchuria and Mongolia being oppressed and invaded by Japan, as the content of this book. The characteristic of this book is that it lists the statistics of various periods and places in great detail, and its analysis of the background and current situation of Japan's invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia is what others cannot do. For example, its preface says,</p>
<p>"In order to awaken the public, there should be a considerable analysis of Japan's deeply rooted colonial policy in Manchuria and Mongolia for the past twenty years, such as how many Japanese colonies are in Manchuria and Mongolia, what methods they use to solve their colonial life, and what are Japan's immigration policies for Korea? What are the number, degree, and nature of these Koreans? Where are they transplanted? What strategies does Japan adopt for this? How does it force them? How does it use them? How does it exploit them? Secondly, how does Japan politically oppress and economically plunder Manchuria and Mongolia│ How does it invest, how does it plunder raw materials and labor, how does it sell its surplus commodities, how does it extract profits and currency│ How does it monopolize transportation undertakings, how does it engage in cultural aggression, and finally, to what extent will it develop its colonial policy? All of these must be given considerable analysis."</p>
<p>In this way, the general content of this book can be seen. It is necessary to read this book in the current study of the Manchurian and Mongolian issues. This book is divided into general theory, various theories, and residual theories, totaling...</p>
<p>General discussion: An overview of Japanese colonization of Manchuria and Mongolia</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The relationship between Japan's rapid population increase and its colonization of Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The relationship between Japan's overall colonial policy and its colonization policy in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Various theories: The function of Japan's colonial policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The role of unequal treaties in political invasion.</p>
<p>Volume 1: The function of economic aggression│(The role of unbalanced exports)</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Plunder of raw materials.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Investment in commerce and industry.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Occupation of transportation.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Invasion of culture.</p>
<p>Residual discussion: A summary of the above discussions and a discussion of the future of Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>Although the above three books mostly have obvious viewpoints, if young people can start reading from the first book onwards, they will at least get a deep impression on the issue of Japan's invasion of Mongolia and Manchuria. We know that Tanaka Giichi's active policy once said, "To destroy China, we must first destroy Manchuria and Mongolia." It can be seen that if we want to study Japan's policy and current situation of aggression against China, we must first start with the policies and history they implemented in Manchuria and Mongolia, as well as the current state. Although the above three books are very insufficient in the content of studying this issue, in my personal opinion, they are still not bad as relatively readable introductory books. Therefore, I specially recommend them.</p>
