<h3>蔣主席發表重要談話關於總統問題</h3>
<p>南京　蔣主席二十二晚發表談話如下有人惟恐天下不亂中國不亡近來又想造謠生亂而其中關於總統的問題更有許多推測之詞有些人想拿着這個問題來做造謠作亂的資料想利用這個問題做攻擊個人的口實一般政治知識幼稚的人惑於謠言遂街談巷議把總統問題當做一個很特别的問題去傳説去討論其實從稍具政治常識與立在革命立塲的人看起來這是一件極普通極尋常的問題旣然值不得做造謠作亂的資料更不能當做攻擊本人的口實今天借這個機會特發表個人關於這個問題的意見最近外面傳説本人要在國民會議裏面提出總統問題自己要做總統實行獨裁制這種謠言實在太没有意義總統要不要的問題不是那一個人所能主張所能决定中國目下有無總統的必要完全要由革命的環境和革命的需要而决定如果革命的環境和革命的需要要求産生一個總統無論那個個人都不能反對拒絶的如果勉强拒絶反足以阻礙革命的成功反過來説假使革命的環境和革命的需要不需要總統任何個人也不能使他産生如果勉强産生正足以使革命失敗這乃是根本原則在十年以前總理爲適應革命的環境促進革命的成功需要産生總統所以不矯情拒絶一定要適應革命的需要毅然樂就總統之任因爲一個人做總統决不是享受權利享受名譽乃是負担義務負担責任權利可以推辭名譽可以逃避而革命的責任决为容推諉革命的義務亦不能放棄總理在民國元年一定要反對袁世凱自就臨時大總統民國十年一定要排除萬難就任非常大總統就是這個意思因爲民國元年南京臨時政府没有成立的時候革命没有最高的統轄機關對内旣然没有統一全國對外又没有得國際的承認當時的革命環境實在需要一個總統對内對外推進革命的進行所以總理便毅然把革命的責任擔負起來就任臨時大總統民國十年革命勢力偏安一隅對内旣没有統率號召的最高機關對外也没有代表國家的政府當時革命環境也要求一個總統所以總理排除萬難不顧一切也就任非常大總統總理兩次就任大總統都是適應革命的要求負擔革命的使命可惜當時許多同志不了解總理的意思致革命事業中途失敗民國元年一般幹部要和袁世凱妥協强勸總理讓總統與袁世凱致演成洪憲稱帝的事件使中華民國幾致中斷民國十年陳炯明反對總理爲非常總統不惜躬冒不韙犯上作亂致使革命根據地的廣州爲反革命的勢力所盤據這些事實都足以證明總理爲革命而就總統一旦離開總統職任遂致革命勢力分散革命事業功敗埀成過去的經騐就是現在的教訓目前的總統問題也可照這樣的判斷如果爲統一中國實行訓政促進建設完成革命計有總統的需要時本人一定不顧一切榮辱成敗毅然就任總統以努力于革命的完成但是現在的革命環境和民國元年不同和民國十年亦不同國民政府已經統一中國了革命政權已經確定了對内對外國民政府已可掌握政權代表國家了在這種情形之下訓政時期實在不需要産生總統到了將來憲政時期是否需要總統現在不必预先討論就目前訓政時期的情形而言個人的意思只要國民政府負起責任</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>依照建國大綱的精神切實做去革命就可以完成不必另選總統否則反足以資反動派造謠的機會又引起人心不安所以個人的意見在國民會議裏面只應制定約法不必而且不應提出總統的問題以上就革命的環境立論至於個人的志願也可附带申明本人的志願是要把一生的精神才力都供獻於革命爲革命而生爲革命而死祗要中國能眞正和平統一不再發生亂事祇求人心安定社會秩序恢復使得人民能安居樂業政治日上建設之途得致全力於不平等條約之廢除三民主義之實行則任何毁謗皆願樂受任何犧牲皆所不懼任何誣衊任何恥辱皆所含忍個人生死且不惜遑論其他個人的成敗與榮辱此固早已置之度外决不想做總統爲一已之虚榮這大槪是知道本人的志願的同志所共知的所以很希望大家不要把很普通的間題當做很特别的問題去看國人當此革命未成謠諑頻興之時難怪其没有正確的是非判斷力很容易爲謠言所搖惑我們政府負責的同志要負責指導使政治日上軌道（二十二日專電）</p>

<h3>德奥經濟同盟</h3>
<p>自德奥經濟同盟之約發表以後歐洲以外之各國尙未有若何之評論在歐洲各國最反對者爲捷克且聞有向德抗議之説以捷克原屬於奥與奥爲近也反對與贊成參半者爲法法之外相與德使且爲是約故而相談甚久内容與法政府意思雖不得而知而其對於此約之注意則可想見也多贊成之意者爲意一般人之印象以爲意國當不至出而反對此約且推測意政府之意將視此舉爲改造歐洲經濟之新途徑焉最贊成而視爲無上之成功者自以德國之輿論爲甚柏林日報稱此約世界經濟史上空前之關税新結合締約之時兩國代表相約對於現在存在之各國條約不相觸犯使第三國無抗議或阻止其施行之機會實屬困難之工作故世界各國無論有無直接關係者皆視爲歐洲國家經濟復興之第一步而反對之者爲不智云</p>
<p>蓋此次德奥經濟同盟之約訂立於法國倡議歐洲經濟同盟之後又值歐洲關税休戰會議失敗之時故反對之者不易於措词而贊成之者實易於立説誠可謂得其時機者矣</p>

<p>▲愛神身有兩翅故易飛來亦易飛去</p>
<p>▲愛火怒發時殘酷心亦生此爲情自殺之所由來歟臺灣番人當别送漢人時往往遞戳其頭以示親暱人類殘酷之心理蓋與生而俱來者也</p>

<p>▲唯困窮乃覺情愛之味唯疾病乃知情愛之眞令以困窮疾病爲離婚之由其情愛之價值可想</p>

<h3>長江失事中零碎</h3>
<p>— 事實</p>
<p>法輪長江號在閩海失事其情形已詳各大報茲將零碎消息分誌如後</p>
<p>▲船主剖輪腹　長江輪之觸礁係在十六日之下午二時照例不致喪斃人命但該輪觸入北漁山外暗礁石上礁石套進二艙如不移動船身全船生命可免死亡而船内之巨欵亦可取出無如船主克里巧脱在得報後令打倒車謂可以退出險礁詎料輪機一動船底之礁石頓將船腹劃分爲二頭二兩艙變成兩片船身乃立即下沉不俟片刻矣</p>
<p>▲女客搶舢板　粤藉女客三人在香港乘輪來滬者在觸礁時三女客急奔艙面争取舢板當奪一艘照例須將掛繩砍斷方能放下海中無如其時船已漸與海平一時不得刀僅將外擋繩解去</p>
<p>而裏擋繩不及解已被海浪激盪舢板覆三女客落水即無踪影並與伍大夫爲伍矣</p>
<p>▲游泳三十丈　長江祇十分鐘即沉船上各職工與旅客乘八舢板逃生不意八舢板全翻此七十餘人完全落海該處距北漁山王十餘丈另一小島約三十丈諸人均在海内游泳到島有旅客五人幸爲能泳之生火水手扶携登岸有十一名職工不知游泳下水即沉入海底</p>
<p>▲蜆壳剌傷人　小島上自下至上全爲海内蜆蛤壳滿砌島之上下此逃出之諸人落海後已失其履到小島時有五十餘人均赤足上小山其蜆蛤壳鋒利如刀各人之足均被剌傷甚有數人頭部亦磕入此壳受創極大昨日到滬時諸人裹頭裹足者比比皆然且有一人蜆傷極重十分危險云</p>
<p>▲飢餓尋魚食　各職工逃至小島上時衣盡濕而無食物歷十六七小時飢寒交逼無可如何至島灘下撈取小魚一二生食充飢有一人吸捲烟不離口者至是無烟可吸其苦更甚第二日爲北漁山鄕民救去後即遍求紙烟以過其癮此亦特殊之嗜好累人也</p>
<p>▲現洋没海内　船内有香港匯兑號代客匯運來上海之現洋十八萬元每五千元裝成一箱共裝三十餘箱在中艙之銀倉間中亦沉在海底船員與職工對此頗爲惋惜聞失欵之某號擬委托日人前往打撈勿使此巨金永沉海底而蒙重大之損失也</p>
<p>▲探問船行踪　此船十六日失事至十八日方始發見滬地雖得訊而不能知其行踪甚至經理之康鎭記亦忙了兩天托招商托美船托電台四出探聽其失事所在直至法艦接日輪電報方知其在溫州福州之交界點距上海凡二百海里云</p>
<h3>歌女紅牡丹確有一看的價値</h3>
<p>— 戈公振</p>
<p>有聲影片一天一天的流行但是我們所看過的完全是舶來品姑無論不　外國語的人固然是莫明其妙就是　得的也未必能十分了解因爲説白當中往往夾着俗語所以我們在尋求快樂的時候竟會感着種族和言語不同的痛苦好了現在國産有聲影片出世了而且「歌女紅牡丹」確有一觀的價値因爲這本戲劇本很好能用反面文章來描寫社會眞相所以幕幕入情入理教人感動末了的兩名話［祇怪她没有受過教育老戲唱得太多了］眞是畫龍點睛最有力量胡蝶女士和王獻齊君在這本戲裏也很能表顯他們的能力演到凄楚的地方不由得要令人灑一掬同情之淚尤其是胡女士的説白非常清脆悦耳爲這本有聲影片增高價値不少</p>
<p>這本戲雖然是有聲的但有幾處却是無聲也非常的得神例如女子至獄中話别時男子頗有天良發現的傾向這正是描寫深刻而忠厚的一點我們不可忽略過</p>
<p>民衆公司同人雖然爲了這本戲費了許多精神和金錢遇有不滿意的地方皆不憚煩的重攝過但是得到這個結果也很可以安慰的了</p>
<p>我希望政府或是社會上團體能知道影戲在民衆方面的勢力對於製造影片的國人要常常的加以監督和與以便利使他們能多造幾種具有教育性質而非純粹謀利的影片</p>

<h3>歐戰日記（續）</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>法國第九軍第四十二師和騎兵團自十月二十三日直戰至十一月十五日再隔幾天之後始得着更替艱苦卓絶可見一斑</p>
<p>頁普里斯之戰戰綫從拿基得到雷斯河的亞孟鐵歐長二十八英里德軍作戰有十五軍團之衆聯軍祗十個軍團十一月三十一日法軍防守陣綫十五英里半英軍十二英里半十一月五日法軍防守陣綫十八英里半英軍九英里半戰綫的長度和兵士的數目上可見法軍不得不擔任大部分的戰鬭所以説頁普里斯之勝利英軍不能獨居首功</p>
<p>敵我兩軍均受重大的損失德軍曾用聯軍所望塵莫及的重砲隊以冀攻克我們抗抵德軍的重砲隊有幾尊是十五英寸口徑的大砲德軍的後備隊尤其熱烈不過遇着了對手軍隊的堅持就不免驚惶失措了這些兵卒在呐喊聲中被驅入火綫密　猛攻結果是一塲大殺戮他們的軍心因之大受打擊……</p>
<p>馬爾内的勝利之後的幾天我們所施行的包抄戰略繼續發展我們遂不得不擴張戰綫從瑞士到北海距離長至四百二十五英里爲有史以來所未聞况且馬爾内大戰之後六星期我們不得不在戰綫北端臨時應付新戰且是决戰</p>
<p>這樣交戰的結果起先自然惹起嚴重的憂懼因爲敵人在和平的時候早已準備着巨大的軍備和存儲着巨額的軍火給他在開戰以來就得着可畏的優勢我們人馬不足軍備軍火更缺乏不得不佈置我們自已的軍隊以及聯軍的陣綫這是我們迎敵的形勢卒以一致努力戰勝難關但是轉危爲安的結果大半是歸功於總司令的注意和决策總司令曾經毅然决然犧牲自己的軍隊塡補大部分聯軍的戰綫</p>
<p>是役的結果頗値得注意聯軍在頁石爾河岸和頁普里斯加於敵人的打擊把他的首先擊潰我們再移師東征俄羅斯的計劃頓成劃餅避免了敵人的侵略和佔領法國北部富庶的區域救護了海峽和北海各口岸維持了英法間的交通使英國避免德軍的襲擊保存比國片土維持其在歐洲地圖上的地位置其政府於敵人勢力之外</p>
<p>聯軍參與是役相持至一月之久卒因他們的密切合作獲得勝利在這種環境之下同舟共濟捐軀流血定使三國的友誼更臻結實這就是聯軍的對照表上的貴重的資産</p>
<p>德軍的亡羊補牢之計就是向頁普里斯加緊砲擊十一月二十二日他們以聖彼得教堂和克洛斯市政廳爲他們的無情的砲彈的目標這些壯麗的建築物俄頃之間變成廢蹟徒供後人唏噓憑弔</p>
<p>頁普里斯之戰更足證明守勢戰藉砲火力尤其是機關砲的發達所獲得的力量攻勢戰則並没有得着這樣的功效兩軍長時間的相持産生一種新戰術就是與所謂行動戰相對待的地位戰這實在無非是戰事上的臨時的危機兵精器利的攻擊無力戰勝防守的自認其弱</p>
<p>見於航空術的進步和化學戰的發展將來的争鬥將無止境因之我們準備第二次大戰不能不首先注意戰争裏所用的可畏的材料至少一部分要在和平時候存儲再造成一個軍事組織以俾戰争的時候能夠好好的運用（未完）</p>

<h3>小説原理</h3>
<p>— 蘇礎</p>
<p>陳穆如作　中華書局出版</p>
<p>中國的新文藝的作品已發達到某種程度尤其是屬於制作小説的一項庶幾充滿於國内的出版界其内容的價値如何暫不斷言但是關於小説原理一類的書在中國實是不多尤其是中國作家自己研究的心得將之發揮出來的是很少見之有的不過零拾一些西洋的小説原理一類的糟粃加以整理而混合起來的東西當然祗可供一般愛好小説者作一種參考其内容是不合中國國情的爲多這在我們是引爲唯一的缺陷的即使小説的定義每人都有每人的意見倘若要得着一個圓滿的確當的定義却是難乎其難的事所以本書作者將自己研究的心得在自序裏發表了一些意見他是這樣的説的一小説是描寫社會的一切背景和人及人的生活狀熊的反映它將其中的苦痛或是悲慘或是快樂或是安慰或是殘忍妬忌恐怖憤怒以及生與死……用着一種最有效力的紀述體的文字描寫出來的在這種文字中間作者要運用藝術的手叚去顯露出現實生活的斷片將自己經騐過的情感傳達給他人以引起其同情像這樣竭力地赤裸裸地描寫出來的作品就呌做小説］作者這種對於小説定義的解説當然是很値得我們底推究和尤其是在中國一般創作者尙未下準確的小説定義之前作者有這樣屬於自己研究所得的一點貢獻出來這委實使我們所贊同的所以其中的内容與價値在此也可以窺見一些梗槪是一部極有意義的關於小説理論的書</p>
<p>全書計分十四章而且分配符極爲妥切完全指最扼要的加以叙述决没有一些所謂無意義的空談其章目例如（一）小説的目的（二）小説的種類（三）浪漫派的作風與寫實派的作風（四）歐美小説發逹的槪况（五）我國小説發達的槪况（六）小説與人生（七）小説與詩歌（六）小説與戲劇（九）小説與科學的關係（八）小説與作家（十）（一）描寫論（十）（二）結構論（十）（三）文體論（十）（四）鑑賞論以及參考書舉例等這實是一部有系統比較完善的書而且作者對於這書的計劃亦有妥切之處可言如第一章至第八章是專寫理論的第四至第五兩章是叙述歷史的第十一至第十四四章是説明方法的這種組織却可算是盡善盡美的了因爲這書即命名爲小説原理當然對於理論方面該側重些所以關於此項在本書中是佔着重要的位置至於歷史方面創作者祗須有以相當的明瞭就可以了所謂小説的作法也是極形重要的作者即分爲四章來説明這實爲本書組織上的完美之處値得加以推許的現爲讀者閲讀便利起見將各章和内容略加分柝使之明瞭其佳點所在</p>
<p>第一章小説的目的作者開章名義即很扼要地叙述减［小説的目的是隨着各家的派别而差異有人説小説的目的在以想像而連貫的事實表現人生的眞理］有人又説［小説在供獻人生的眞實的描繪］尼查特生在巴米拉的序文裏説［若能安慰青年男女的心使之快樂同時又能教化改善他們…若能將宗教與道德極容易而愉快的教導他們使他們均匀的得着歡樂與利益…若能使長幼和義務社會的義務最明白的發揮出來…若惡德使人見而生厭美德使人見而生歡…若能把人生正眞而確實的描繪得出…若能騐驅聰明的讀者之熱情不知不覺的引進故事之中以達列舉以上的各種善良的目的…］像這樣的對於小説目的的徵引搜集是很爲不易在作者最後將這一段「巴米拉」的序文的大意又加以一種槪括的叙述使讀者一目瞭然這實是科學的研究方法如歸納着説（一）在使小説有趣（二）在使小説應含溶化宗教道德的教訓的意味（三）在使小説應正確的描繪人生除此之外作者在本章的最末又加以正確的結論「小説家的目的眞是難以縷述從小説的誕生以至於現在在每册著作裏都可以看出作者的目的如近代人之提倡革命文學或無産階級文學其目的又在以作品當作符籙此外尙有一般墮落的作家丨如寫黑幕小説之類亦以作品爲工具這類當然不在叙論之列了」這話却含有至上的眞義同時也可看出作者的立塲和熊度來</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Important Speech on the Presidential Issue</h3>
<p>Nanjing - Chairman Chiang delivered the following speech on the evening of the 22nd: Some people, fearing that the world is not in chaos and China will not perish, have recently sought to create rumors and cause disturbances. Among these, the issue of the presidency has been the subject of much speculation. Some people want to use this issue as material for creating rumors and disturbances, and want to use this issue as a pretext for attacking individuals. People with little political knowledge are misled by rumors and, as a result, discuss the presidential issue in the streets as if it were a very special problem. In fact, from the perspective of someone with even a little political common sense and a revolutionary stance, this is an extremely ordinary and common problem. It is neither worthy of being used as material for creating rumors and disturbances, nor can it be used as a pretext for attacking me personally. Today, I take this opportunity to express my personal views on this issue. Recently, there have been rumors outside that I will raise the presidential issue in the National Assembly, wanting to become president myself and implement a dictatorship. Such rumors are really meaningless. Whether a president is needed or not is not something that one person can advocate or decide. Whether China currently needs a president depends entirely on the revolutionary environment and the needs of the revolution. If the revolutionary environment and the needs of the revolution require the creation of a president, no individual can oppose or refuse it. Forcing a refusal would only hinder the success of the revolution. Conversely, if the revolutionary environment and the needs of the revolution do not require a president, no individual can bring one into being. Forcing one into being would only lead to the failure of the revolution. This is a fundamental principle. Ten years ago, in order to adapt to the revolutionary environment and promote the success of the revolution, Premier Sun Yat-sen needed to create a presidency, so he did not feign refusal, but resolutely accepted the position of president in order to meet the needs of the revolution. Because one person becoming president is definitely not about enjoying rights and prestige, but about bearing obligations and responsibilities. Rights can be declined, and prestige can be avoided, but the responsibility of revolution cannot be evaded, and the obligation of revolution cannot be abandoned. That is why Premier Sun Yat-sen was determined to oppose Yuan Shikai and assume the position of Provisional President in the first year of the Republic (1912), and why he was determined to overcome all difficulties and assume the position of Extraordinary President in the tenth year of the Republic (1921). Because when the Provisional Government of Nanjing was not established in the first year of the Republic, the revolution did not have a supreme governing body. Internally, there was no unified national leadership, and externally, there was no international recognition. The revolutionary environment at that time really needed a president to promote the progress of the revolution both internally and externally. Therefore, Premier Sun Yat-sen resolutely took on the responsibility of revolution and assumed the position of Provisional President. In the tenth year of the Republic, the revolutionary forces were entrenched in a corner. Internally, there was no supreme body to command and mobilize, and externally, there was no government to represent the country. The revolutionary environment at that time also required a president. Therefore, Premier Sun Yat-sen overcame all difficulties and took on the position of Extraordinary President, regardless of everything. Premier Sun Yat-sen's two assumptions of the presidency were both to meet the demands of the revolution and to bear the mission of the revolution. Unfortunately, many comrades at the time did not understand Premier Sun Yat-sen's intentions, which led to the failure of the revolutionary cause midway. In the first year of the Republic, a group of cadres wanted to compromise with Yuan Shikai and strongly urged Premier Sun Yat-sen to yield the presidency to Yuan Shikai, which led to the incident of Yuan Shikai proclaiming himself emperor, nearly interrupting the Republic of China. In the tenth year of the Republic, Chen Jiongming opposed Premier Sun Yat-sen as Extraordinary President and did not hesitate to commit the crime of rebellion and insurrection, causing the revolutionary base of Guangzhou to be occupied by counter-revolutionary forces. These facts are sufficient to prove that Premier Sun Yat-sen assumed the presidency for the sake of the revolution. Once he left the presidential office, the revolutionary forces were dispersed and the revolutionary cause failed. The experience of the past is the lesson of the present. The current presidential issue can also be judged in the same way. If there is a need for a president in order to unify China, implement tutelage, promote construction, and complete the revolution, I will definitely take on the presidency regardless of all honor and disgrace, success or failure, in order to strive for the completion of the revolution. However, the current revolutionary environment is different from the first year of the Republic and also different from the tenth year of the Republic. The National Government has already unified China, and the revolutionary regime has already been established. Internally and externally, the National Government can control the government and represent the country. Under these circumstances, there is really no need to create a president during the period of political tutelage. Whether a president is needed in the future constitutional period need not be discussed in advance. As far as the current situation of political tutelage is concerned, my personal opinion is that as long as the National Government takes on its responsibilities</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>and earnestly implements the spirit of the Outline of National Reconstruction, the revolution can be completed without the need to elect another president. Otherwise, it would only provide an opportunity for the reactionaries to spread rumors and cause public unrest. Therefore, my personal opinion is that the National Assembly should only formulate a provisional constitution and should not and need not raise the issue of the presidency. The above is based on the revolutionary environment. As for my personal aspirations, I can also state them incidentally. My aspiration is to dedicate all my energy and talent to the revolution, to live for the revolution, and to die for the revolution. As long as China can be truly peacefully unified and no more turmoil occurs, as long as people's hearts are stable and social order is restored, so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment, and politics improves day by day and the path of construction leads to the full abolition of unequal treaties and the implementation of the Three Principles of the People, then I am willing to gladly accept any slander, I am not afraid of any sacrifice, and I will endure any slander and any humiliation. I do not even care about my own life and death, let alone other personal successes and failures. This has long been put aside, and I definitely do not want to become president for my own vain glory. This is probably known to all comrades who know my aspirations. Therefore, I very much hope that everyone will not regard a very ordinary issue as a very special problem. When the revolution has not yet succeeded and rumors are rampant, it is not surprising that the people do not have correct judgments of right and wrong and are easily swayed by rumors. Our responsible comrades in the government must be responsible for guiding them to get politics back on track. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Talking about the League of Nations Gold Loan Issue</p>
<p>Beiping - The League of Nations Transportation Minister Haas arrived in Beiping today. Song Wenbin from the Ministry of Finance accompanied him. Haas said that he came to investigate the transportation situation in China. China's participation in the League of Nations is extremely sincere, and even though the country has been troubled for many years, it has made every effort to pay its League of Nations dues and show all due respect. The international community has a very strong feeling for China. The unified government of Nanjing has entered the path of construction, and we are here to inspect. When asked about the League of Nations gold loan, he replied that he had not heard anything about it in Beijing. The League of Nations is like a public association and does not have huge sums of money to lend. If extremely small countries cannot sustain themselves, they may receive a small subsidy. China's needs are extremely large, and the League of Nations would not dare to undertake this. It is not a fact. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>German-Austrian Economic Alliance</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the German-Austrian Economic Alliance agreement, countries outside of Europe have not yet made any comments. Among European countries, the most opposed is Czechoslovakia, and it is rumored that they have protested to Germany because Czechoslovakia originally belonged to Austria and is close to Austria. The reactions of France are half opposition and half support, and the French Foreign Minister and the German Ambassador have consulted for a long time because of this agreement. Although the content and intentions of the French government are unknown, their attention to this agreement can be imagined. Italy is more supportive. The general impression is that Italy will not oppose this agreement and it is speculated that the Italian government will view this move as a new way to transform the European economy. Germany's public opinion is the most supportive and regards it as an unparalleled success. The Berlin Daily claims that this agreement is an unprecedented new customs union in the history of the world economy. When concluding the agreement, the representatives of the two countries agreed not to conflict with the existing treaties of various countries, so that third countries would have no opportunity to protest or prevent its implementation. This is indeed a difficult task. Therefore, all countries in the world, whether they have direct relations or not, regard this as the first step in the economic recovery of European countries, and those who oppose it are unwise, it is said.</p>
<p>This German-Austrian Economic Alliance agreement was concluded after France proposed the European Economic Alliance and at a time when the European Customs Truce Conference failed. Therefore, it is not easy for those who oppose it to find words, and it is easy for those who support it to establish their arguments. It can be said that it has found its opportunity.</p>

However, it can be expanded in special circumstances.

<h3>Spanish People Regain Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>Censorship Laws Officially Abolished</p>
<p>Accused Republicans to Stand Trial</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 22nd - As expected, the order to abolish censorship laws and restore constitutional guarantees was officially announced today. The cabinet also resolved to abolish all orders issued by the Rivera Dictatorship regarding the jurisdiction of military and naval courts. Yesterday, the military court opened the trial of twelve prominent Republicans who signed the Republican Manifesto last November, including former cabinet member Chamorra, Maura, brother of the current Minister of Labor, and Rivas, President of the University of Madrid, who were all figures of public attention. Everyone stood up to pay their respects when these figures entered the court, but the court was silent at the opening. Spain's most famous lawyer, Galardu, spoke in defense of the defendant, which was equivalent to attacking the current government. It is expected that the trial will be completed today and the verdict will be announced within a few days.</p>
<h3>Austro-German Customs Union</h3>
<p>Many Central European Countries Express Doubt and Fear</p>
<p>German Public Opinion Unanimously Approves</p>
<p>National Gazette, Prague (Czech Capital), 21st - There is much suspicion here about the new Austro-German trade agreement. Some newspapers that have close ties with foreign countries even claim that Austria's establishment of a customs union with another country is tantamount to abandoning part of its sovereignty in customs policy and must be considered a move that violates treaties guaranteeing such sovereignty. The organ of the National Democratic Party also criticized the government for failing to obtain sufficient information during the Austro-German negotiations and stated that the progress of Germany's commercial and political position in Central Europe will directly affect the interests of Czechoslovakia. In addition, many newspapers also hold unfriendly attitudes and express resentment.</p>
<p>National Gazette, Berlin, 21st - Reports from Paris indicate that France, Britain, Italy, and a certain Central European country (believed to be Czechoslovakia) have formally protested to the German Foreign Ministry against the new Austro-German trade agreement, saying that if implemented, the countries will jointly wage a customs war against Germany as a threat. However, this newspaper's reporter inquired with the German Foreign Ministry, which stated that it had not received any such protests. German officials also stated that they had not heard of such protests and threats and did not expect the four countries to take such steps.</p>
<p>National Gazette, Paris, 21st - The Paris newspapers have few detailed comments on the new Austro-German agreement, but judging from the existing comments, they generally approve. For example, the Paris Echo, a notoriously radical nationalist newspaper, its famous reporter, Bertina, commented on this agreement, saying that the wording is careful and does not create a true customs merger. It is expected that the Committee for Consideration of the European Federation Plan will be enthusiastically welcomed because the agreement will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the consolidation of the European economy. Although the Industrial Daily stated that this agreement will make Germany and Austria occupy a superior position in the Central European economic sphere, which is enough to disrupt the existing balance of economic power in Central Europe, its overall comments are still friendly. In addition, the Little Parisian newspaper stated that the Germans are once again embracing the old concept of developing eastward, and the Times questioned whether this agreement is not contradictory to existing agreements. This afternoon, French Foreign Minister Briand met with the German Ambassador for a long time, and it is expected that it was related to this agreement, but the content of their conversation and the French government's opinion on the agreement have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>National Gazette, Rome, 21st - Political circles here are paying close attention to the new Austro-German trade agreement. The general impression is that Italy will not oppose it, and the Italian government seems to regard this move as a new path for European economic transformation.</p>
<p>National Gazette, Berlin, 21st - The conclusion of the new Austro-German customs agreement has aroused general praise from public opinion, and political circles also cite it as a topic of daily conversation. The Berlin Daily stated that the agreement is an unprecedented new customs alliance in the history of the world economy and that the representatives of the two countries were able to agree not to violate the existing treaties, so that third parties had no opportunity to protest or prevent its implementation, which was extremely difficult to work towards. Therefore, today's new alliance between Germany and Austria should be regarded by all countries in the world, whether directly related or not, as the first step in the economic recovery of European countries. Therefore, we should regard anyone who makes rumors about the agreement in an attempt to sabotage it as an extremely unwise move. The opinions of other newspapers are also mostly the same. Some also say that this agreement is actually the only savior at present because the previous Pan-European Federation, the European International Conference, and the European Customs Truce Conference, etc., have now disappeared like a fleeting bubble. With this, Europe can re-enter the path of mutual trust and optimism.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Situation Tending Towards Stability</h3>
<p>Parliamentary Warfare Nearing its End</p>
<p>Planning to Win Hearts and Minds with the Party to Maintain Power</p>
<p>Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 22nd - The Minsei Party was very worried about the future of the political situation due to the illness of Prime Minister Hamaguchi. However, the no-confidence motion was rejected at the meeting on the 20th. This parliamentary warfare can be said to be coming to an end, and the future is expected to be stable. Some cabinet members have suggested that after the parliament ends, they should wait for the Prime Minister's health to fully recover and plan to establish a rejuvenated government with the party's new direction to thoroughly reorganize administration, finance, and the tax system. At the same time, in view of the current national situation, they will decide on a new policy to relieve the people's livelihood and then implement a nationwide lobbying campaign of ideology and policy in preparation for the general election of prefectural and county councilors this autumn.</p>
<h3>After the Death of Former German Chancellor Muller</h3>
<p>The Entire Country Mourns in Unison</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 21st - Today, the Parliament lowered the flag to half-mast to mourn the death of Dr. Muller and held a memorial service. Those who attended included Premier Bruning, the heads of various departments, representatives of various states, and members of parliament. Members of the National Socialist Party, the German National People's Party, and the Communist Party were excluded. Parliamentary Speaker Robber and Bruning gave speeches praising the merits of former Chancellor Muller. Socialist parties from all over the world sent telegrams of condolence upon hearing of Muller's death. British Prime Minister McDonald also sent a telegram of condolence. As for the people and public opinion circles throughout Germany, they all expressed their condolences in unison. Most newspapers praised Muller's merits during his lifetime, saying that although Muller was a member of the Social Democratic Party, he always put the country first in everything and was faithful and talented. The left-wing newspapers praised Muller for his selflessness and said that although people were worried about his lack of energy when he was in the premiership, his moderate policies will continue to exist even though he has passed away.</p>

<h3>Governor of the Bank of England to Visit the U.S. to Discuss Silver Issues with Hoover</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 21st - According to today's news, Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, will come to the United States in the near future to discuss the world's silver issues with Hoover. Senator Borah issued another statement today saying that the current global economic downturn is largely due to the drastic drop in silver prices, which makes it difficult for countries on the gold standard to trade with countries on the silver standard. However, the price of silver cannot be expected to improve until countries agree not to interfere with the natural demand for silver in China, India, and other countries. In addition, it is also heard that the US President is paying close attention to finding ways to save the silver market. According to those close to the President, as soon as the US State Department and Treasury Department present rescue methods, the President intends to consider ways to implement the resolution passed by the previous Senate to request the President to find ways to prevent silver prices from falling again and, if necessary, convene an international conference to discuss the use of silver as currency.</p>

<h3>Before Mo Teh-hui's Departure Abroad</h3>
<p>Slight Changes in Secretaries and Staff</p>
<p>Urgent Resolution of Railway Bureau Cases</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The personnel accompanying Mo Teh-hui on this trip abroad were finalized yesterday. The number is slightly increased compared to before. Wang Huanwen, the secretary who recently returned home, along with staff members Cui Shuyan, Xie Yihang, clerks Tao Guilin, Wu Jialu, and Sun Suzhen, have all resigned. Mo then replaced them with Wu Run as secretary, Wu Hongyou and Chen Guangqi as staff members, and Ge Jingzhen, Guan Ronggui, Dai Yunzhang, and Ms. Fu Dequan as clerks. Wu Run is the secretary-general of the Northeast Frontier Defense Commander-in-Chief's Office and was recommended by Zhang Xueliang for his proficiency in English and Russian. Chen Guangqi is the secretary of the Northeast Navigation Bureau and has collaborated with Zhang Shou-zeng in surveying the Heilong and Wusuli rivers for Russia, and is very familiar with Northeast navigation administration. In addition to the existing personnel who remain unchanged, the newly added Zhang Shou-zeng has already arrived in Harbin. Wang Mingchen is still in Liaoning and needs to depart for Harbin on the 18th. Li Chen is expected to arrive in Harbin before the 19th via telegraph. Xu Jianping will come with Qian Tai. Mo wants to arrive in Moscow before April 5th for the opening of the meeting on the 15th, so he cannot wait in Harbin for long and plans to depart on the 21st. If the two special commissioners, Qian and Xu, cannot arrive in Harbin before the 21st, they will be guided there by the diplomatic courier Fu Zhanwen when they arrive. Regarding the delegation's expenses, the central government has agreed to allocate another 100,000 yuan, which can be remitted to Liaoning by the end of this month. Mo will not be able to carry it with him when he departs and will send it by mail later. Today (the 16th), Mo ordered the accompanying personnel to rush to pack their luggage. The newly added personnel will still wear Chinese clothing when going abroad. The reason for the changes in the delegation's staff is that the previous staff members all held positions in the railway. Once they went abroad, their original positions were put on hold, and they still received their regular salaries and travel expenses. The delegation also provided them with generous salaries. The Russian director of the Eastern Railway was dissatisfied with this. When the returning staff members submitted their expense reports, the Russian director refused to issue them. Mo Teh-hui did not want to cause disputes over such minor matters, so he ordered the non-essential staff to resign and replaced them with non-railway personnel.</p>
<p>The Eastern Railway Council also urgently wants to resolve important matters through consultation before Mo Teh-hui leaves the country. At the meeting on the 14th of this month, a part of the plan for layoffs and salary reductions was passed. All railway employees with monthly salaries of 80 rubles or more will have their salaries reduced by another 10% starting from April 1st. Redundant staff in various departments will be reduced as appropriate based on the complexity of the tasks to save money, with the number of people reduced being approximately between three hundred and five hundred. However, the Chinese councilors believe that the matter of laying off 300 Chinese workers at the Eastern Railway's General Factory is of greater importance and requires consideration, so it is still undecided. The issues of assigning positions to the translators and students of the Rotary Training School of the Railway Bureau are also urgently in need of resolution. It is impossible to guess what the outcome will be. After the dispute that occurred in the Translation Office on February 19th, it was originally expected that Mo Teh-hui would resolve it upon his return. Mo is now making great efforts to mend the situation in order to prevent an escalation of the dispute between China and Russia. Therefore, on March 6th, he convened the translators who passed the examination at the Superintendent's Office and instructed them that they would definitely be assigned positions within a week. At the same time, he also sent letters to various newspapers, strongly denying the claim that a dispute had occurred at the Eastern Railway Council meeting on the 19th. However, a week of negotiations has passed, and there is still no progress. The translators who passed the examination have still not been assigned positions by the Russian director. As for the Rotary Training School, which is run by the railway specifically to train junior Chinese railway employees, the first class of 50 graduates was assigned to practice in various departments of the Railway Bureau last spring. According to the regulations, they should be assigned positions upon completion of the practice period, but on the 10th of this month, when the practice period ended, the Russian director ordered the suspension of subsidies and ignored the assignment of positions. At the same time, the second class of 53 graduates has also graduated, and the Russian Railway Director has not assigned them to practice either. At the beginning of this month, the students elected representatives to meet with Mo Teh-hui. On the 12th of this month, Mo summoned the students for instruction and said that he would do his best to find a way to assign positions to the students with the best performance, and the next best would also be assigned positions soon, while those with poor performance would be dealt with in another way. However, he was still blocked by the Russian director, and so far, not a single person has obtained an assignment. Mo is currently raising the issue in the Council, hoping to find a solution to these important problems before leaving the country. (16th)</p>
<h3>The South Manchuria Railway Adopts the Silver Standard</h3>
<p>To Resist the North Ning Railway</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since the gold rush occurred, all Japanese-owned enterprises in Northeast China have been greatly affected, the most important of which is transportation. Because most of the special products of the Northeast were transported by the South Manchuria Railway, after the sharp rise in gold prices, they gradually shifted to the North Ning Railway. As of recently, there has been a tendency to completely change to transportation via that route. The authorities of the South Manchuria Railway had no choice but to find ways to provide relief. It was decided at the end of last month that the freight rate between Sipingjie and Yingkou would be implemented in silver standard to save the cost of transport for households and to resist the North Ning Railway and reverse the declining trend of the South Manchuria Railway transport. Since the change to the silver standard, the freight rate has been reduced by between sixty and eighty yuan per car. Compared to the freight rate to Dalian before, the average reduction is one hundred and thirty yuan per car. For example, the previous freight rate from Sipingjie to Yingkou was 293.7 yuan per car. If converted to silver at a silver price of 40 yuan, it is 195.8 yuan, a difference of 97.9 yuan. As for the freight rate between Sipingjie and Dalian, it is 359.7 yuan per car, with a difference of 163.9 yuan. The difference between transporting to Yingkou and transporting to Dalian is so huge that the export of special products from Andong Customs and the export of special products from Dalian Customs will inevitably be greatly affected. A comparison of the new and old freight rates is as follows: (1) From Liaoning to Yingkou, the old price was 154.8 yuan, and the new price is 85.8 yuan, a difference of 69 yuan. (2) From Kaiyuan to Yingkou, the old price was 233.7 yuan, and the new price is 178 yuan, a difference of 62.5 yuan. (3) From Tieling to Yingkou, the old price was 208.2 yuan, and the new price is 144.4 yuan, a difference of 63.8 yuan. (4) From Sipingjie to Yingkou, the old price was 293.7 yuan, and the new price is 195.8 yuan, a difference of 97.9 yuan. Since the differences above are so huge, the impact on the export of special products from Andong cannot be avoided. As a result, Japanese businessmen in Dalian who are engaged in the business of Northeast special products cannot help but panic. Representatives of Japanese businessmen and industrialists have repeatedly made representations to the authorities of the South Manchuria Railway, and it is reported that the president of the South Manchuria Railway, Sen Ishiguro, has indicated that the company's freight rate will be changed to the silver standard not only for Sipingjie-Yingkou, but also for Dalian and Andong, and a method of reducing freight rates and changing to the silver standard will be implemented in the near future in order to achieve the company's goal of relying on the three ports of Andong, Yingkou, and Dalian as the center. Now that a freight policy of drastically changing to the silver standard is in place, it will first be implemented between Sipingjie and Yingkou, and gradually extended to Andong and Dalian.

<h3>Gao Shuxun's Troops Recapture Le'an</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The 27th Division of the National Army was ordered to come to Jiangxi to suppress the Communists. Division Commander Gao Shuxun heard on the 13th that the situation in Le'an was urgent, so he led the entire division from Zhangshu towards that area. On the 14th, they advanced to the south of Jiaokengxu and encountered the Communist bandits' spear squads. They were defeated, and they were closely pursued until dawn on the 15th, when they fought the main force of the Communist bandits north of Le'an. Commander Gao's troops bravely advanced and attacked, and the bandits also stubbornly resisted. By 4 pm, Commander Gao's detachments encircled and suppressed them in close combat. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards Yongfeng. Commander Gao's troops completely recaptured Le'an the next morning and are now preparing to continue the pursuit. It is reported that Commander-in-Chief Sun Lianzhong advanced to Yihuang on the 19th to supervise the suppression. (20th)</p>
<h3>The Establishment of the Hubei Local Pacification General Bureau is Scheduled</h3>
<p>He Chengjun Sets Four Major Guidelines for Local Pacification</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Over the past few months, the bandits and Communists in Hubei Province have been gradually suppressed by the garrison troops through various routes of vigorous suppression. However, scattered small groups lurking in the local areas are still secretly growing and waiting for an opportunity to move. The chairman of the provincial government, He Chengjun, believes that if careful planning is not carried out at this time of organizing local pacification, it will not be enough to eradicate the roots and block the source of chaos. Therefore, he formulated local pacification measures, which are divided into four major guidelines: organization, training, propaganda, and benevolence to the people, totaling eleven items. Regarding organization, the local pacification sub-bureaus in each county will organize ten-person groups of anti-Communist squads for each household to implement a joint responsibility system to make it impossible for bandits and Communists to find a place to live, and</p>

<p>Important News Briefs</p>
<p>Allow people to manufacture soil guns, swords and spears, and purchase additional long and short guns to strengthen self-defense capabilities. Regarding training, each county should carefully select capable gentlemen to undergo strict training to cultivate cadres to shoulder all local pacification follow-up work. Regarding propaganda, collect the conspiracies and poisonous schemes of the Communist Party, compile them into a booklet, and distribute it to rural towns so that people can deeply recognize the face of the Communist Party and avoid being misled. Regarding benevolence to the people, implement a policy of benevolence to the people, according to the severity of the bandit disaster in each county, appropriately defer or completely waive a portion of the poll tax and miscellaneous taxes, and distribute emergency relief to help disaster victims. The provincial government will report to the headquarters for review and approval and instruct the Local Pacification General Bureau and the Department of Civil Affairs and Finance to take note. As for the Local Pacification General Bureau, it is scheduled to start working on the 25th, and it is divided into five sections: general affairs, local pacification, and group affairs. In addition to Zhang Gang, the chief of staff of the Security Department, being responsible for the preparation, Lu Chengzu, a secretary assigned by the provincial government, and inspector Wu Bingyuan, will assist in handling the matter. Today, the provincial government additionally assigned Yu Weitao, assistant secretary, Xi Wende, Lu Shoutu, inspectors, Cheng Zhaosong, chief of the guard section, Wang Xuehai, chief of the judicial section, Zhou Zuyou, Luo Hui, Yang Hongyou, Lu Rongwen, Long Qirui, Zhu Zelin, Xu Daheng, Zhang Hongjian, Pan Jiyun, and other clerks to join the Security Department in quickly preparing for the establishment.

<h3>Progress of the Longhai Railway Project</h3>
<p>The Lingbao Bridge Begins Construction</p>
<p>It Can Reach Wenxiang by the End of June</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence: Since the Longhai Railway Engineering Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Railways to complete the Lingtong section of the project within a time limit, it has resumed the long-suspended construction work. At present, all earthwork and culverts for the 72-kilometer Lingtong section have been basically completed. There are a total of eleven mountain tunnels, seven of which have been completed, and two of which are nearing completion. The main projects now are the continued opening of mountain tunnels and the construction of steel bridges. West of Lingbao Station, there is a large bridge 30 meters long with a total of twelve spans. The bridge materials and parts weigh approximately one thousand tons and have already been transported to the construction site. The Engineering Bureau has transferred Hong Fan, a bridge and construction engineer from the Pinghan Railway, to oversee the construction. Hong has led the workers to Lingbao and started work. It is expected that the bridge will be completed in 60 days. After the bridge is completed, material cars will be able to travel westward without hindrance. However, the transportation of road construction materials is very inconvenient. It is estimated that there are approximately 10,000 tons of steel rails and bridge materials stored in Wusong, Qingdao, Dapu, and Pukou. In addition, there are 2,500 tons of cement and 80,000 sleepers purchased from Tangshan, which are being transported one after another. The Engineering Bureau has organized four special trains to transport materials, each capable of carrying 500 tons, which are being transported around the clock. As for the rail-laying project in Lingbao, it is being prepared. It is planned to use a light railway to transport steel rails, steel sleepers, and other materials while laying them westward along the roadbed. At the same time, boats will be used on the Yellow River to transport a portion of the steel rails and materials to Wenxiang County, and tracks will be laid eastward and westward from Wenxiang Station. With such active progress, it is expected that trains can reach Wenxiang in June and may reach Tongguan in October.</p>
<h3>All Registration Books for Jiangsu are Sent to the Province</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Office for the Election of National Assembly Representatives has been very busy recently, especially with urgently urging counties to submit election registration books for printing by a deadline. Yesterday was the deadline for counties to submit election registration books, and the receiving and dispatching section still had people from Donghai, Nantong, and other counties carrying registration books to arrive late at night. Currently, all counties except Songjiang and two or three others have submitted all of their registration books, and they have been reviewed by the review group and sent to the printing office for printing. However, it is difficult to print everything by the 24th due to time constraints. Previously, General Supervisor Hu added more than 20 mimeograph workers to help, but in reality, it is still feared that it will be too late. Yesterday, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Consolidation Committee and the Secretariat of the Provincial Government added more than ten more people, totaling more than 40 people, to work overnight in the ordinary meeting room of the Provincial Government. Even yesterday, Sunday, they were working as usual. It is also heard that after the printing is completed and bound into books, the office plans to send telegrams to the counties ordering them to send people to the office to collect the election tickets within a specified period.

<h3>Chu Minyi Lectures on Vocational Issues</h3>
<p>The China Vocational Education Society held its 17th lecture the other day, with more than 100 attendees. Chu Minyi was invited to speak on the topic of "Vocational Issues." Mr. Chu first described the reasons why vocational development in our country has been unable to progress, saying that there are no statistics on the number of unemployed people in our country. Farmers account for 80%, and although they are producers, they have not received education, so they stick to old methods and do not know how to improve. Their use of force is the same as that of animals. They do not know the value of manpower. If machines are used for production, one person can抵抵数十人 can抵抵百人之力 can they be more economical. This is why vocationalism in China is underdeveloped. Ordinary farmers are poor and foolish, and a few intelligent议员階級 often do not follow the right track. The future is worrying, so I proposed to the central government the other day to use movies to promote culture, which will definitely be effective. Next, he talked about how French people choose careers and the standards for choosing careers. They must be based on personality, interest, and physical fitness. Students in schools should be given internship opportunities, and both mental and physical labor should be used to make it easier to advance in their careers. At the end of the speech, the society's deputy director, Yang Weiyu, expressed his gratitude, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Western Police Win the Senior Football Cup - Zhenru Unfortunately Loses</h3>
<p>A Score of Zero to Two</p>
<p>Red Men and Green Women | There Were As Many As 12,000 People</p>
<p>Expressing Regret in Unison | Zhenru's Efforts Come to Naught</p>
<p>The Athletes Try Hard | They Will Win the Championship Again Next Year</p>
<p>The weather was fine and the sun shone brightly. Yesterday, the Zhenru football team played against the Western Police team in the Senior Cup final at the Shenyuan football field. The game started at 3 p.m. The second-class seating area on Jiaozhou Road was already full by 2 p.m., and the first-class seating area was also almost full. There were many spectators standing on the walls. There were as many as 12,000 red men and green women. Unfortunately, Zhenru lost by a score of 0-2, and the Western Police team won the cup. This was somewhat disappointing. It is hoped that the athletes will work hard and win the championship again next year to comfort their ardent hopes. The lineups of the two teams are listed below:</p>
<p>Zhenru Team Lineup</p>
<p>Xie Quanhe, Feng Yunyou, Jiang Shanqing, Liang Shutang, Wen Dingxin, Chen Jiaqiu, Fu Hexuan, Luo Haiguang, Dai Linjing, Chen Zhenhe, Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>Western Police Team Lineup</p>
<p>Brandt, Scott, Mark Fee, Hurley, Garsh, Whis and Whiggin, Turner, Francis, Jack, O'Claire</p>
<p>Success or Failure Determines Heroes</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu Stands Out</p>
<p>Zhenru struggled through the Senior Cup, fighting hard for one week and two weeks, finally reaching the final stage. Unexpectedly, their efforts came to naught, which is deeply regrettable. In the semi-finals, they eliminated the Shanghai team in the last five minutes, and everyone said that Zhenru was lucky. It was thought that they would be even more successful in the final, but the result was the opposite. However, there were reasons for yesterday's defeat. The center back Zhuang Shihong was absent due to a leg injury. Although Wen Dingxin is a veteran, he has been out of practice for a long time. He can barely cope, but ultimately feels weak. This was seen at the time of the loss. The forwards were weakened and the opponent's defense was strong, so they could not develop an inch and there were very few opportunities to attack the goal. Among the forwards, Fu and Luo alone were unremarkable, and Dai and Chen did not perform well. As a result, there was defense but no offense. This was the second reason. The goalkeeper lacked experience. This was the third reason. However, the defenders did their best under the fierce attack of a strong opponent, and only two goals were lost. The two left and right midfielders were very effective and stood out. Liang Shutang is a rising star, and Chen Jiaqiu stood out even more. His position was appropriate and his passing was effective. He worked hard both offensively and defensively. It is commendable that Chen Jiaqiu did not seem very effective as a forward, but unexpectedly, when his position changed, he immediately showed his heroic qualities.</p>
<p>The Athletes Show Their Skills</p>
<p>The Western Police Team is After All Extraordinary</p>
<p>The Western Police team's performance seemed slightly better. The strength of their defense and midfield lines is unmatched in Shanghai. Mark Fee and Scott are like Mount Tai. The three midfielders of the center line, Garsh, lock down the iron gate. The reason why Zhenru's forwards were inferior was that the Western Police team's defense was too strong. The five forwards were also well-positioned. No wonder they are rampant on the sea. In the overall game, the Western Police team won by one goal in the first half, but each team had opportunities. It was common to see Zhenru returning without success. In the second half, the Western Police team's attack was quite fierce. In the last few minutes, Zhenru was exhausted and barely held on, resulting in the defeat.</p>
<p>Disaster Suddenly Flies In</p>
<p>The Western Police Open the Scoring and Win</p>
<p>With a few firecrackers, the Zhenru team bravely entered the field and lined up to attack. Zhenru was in the west and the Western Police were in the east, with the setting sun at their backs. Zhenru had the advantage of the terrain. With a whistle from the referee, Marshall, the Western Police kicked off. Whiggin was offside and returned. Fu Hexuan passed from the right, Mark Fee missed his footing. Fortunately, Brandt kicked it out. Afterwards, the two teams were seen competing against each other, with offside calls being made from time to time. After thirty minutes, Zhenru had no chance to attack the goal. Everyone was already worried when disaster struck. Whiggin passed from the left, Jiang Shanqing rushed to stop him, and Francis kicked the ball with extreme precision. Xie Quanhe looked at each other in dismay as the ball fell into the net. The Western Police team took the lead, 1-0. After this loss, Zhenru was invigorated and the forwards began to coordinate and move more actively. However, the first half was already over.</p>
<p>The Goal is Lost Again</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Recover from This Point Onward</p>
<p>After a short rest, the battle resumed. Zhenru's momentum was strong, but the Western Police's attack was also fierce. Dangerous balls were seen from time to time. Wen Dingxin missed his footing, and Turner and Francis followed one after another to the front of the goal, three feet away from the goal, but they missed. Fortunately, when Zhenru advanced, they were blocked by the two gates. Jack and others came again in succession. Whiggin lightly kicked the ball in, but it went out at an angle. The situation was serious. Zhenru was clearly struggling to win. There was a sudden commotion among the spectators, and Zhenru's moment of life and death had arrived. Hurley rushed forward, and Whiggin passed the ball to the right again. Francis bent over and headed the ball, and the ball jumped into the goal again. Another goal was lost, and Zhenru's hopes were slim. Although Feng Yunyou and Wen Dingxin exchanged positions, there was no great effect. The mountains and rivers were in turmoil, and all that could be seen were the tracks of enemy cavalry. After the end of the game, the secretary of the Westerners' Association handed the cup to Hurley of the Western Police team, and the crowd dispersed.</p>
<h3>Yuehua Wins Big Yesterday</h3>
<p>Defeats the Shanghai Westerners by Three to Zero</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yuehua football team defeated the Shanghai Westerners team by a score of 3-0 at the China Baseball Field, setting a special record for this season's football match. It is surprising that Yuehua, with its sluggish lineup, was able to achieve such a miraculous feat. Moreover, the Westerners team had a well-established record and was defeated by Yuehua, which is truly unimaginable. The hundreds of spectators in the stadium were all smiling and overjoyed. Yuehua's skills were clearly on display, and both the forwards and defenders were able to perform as they wished. Zhou Xianyan and Li Ning's valiant efforts to support the forwards' work were commendable and outstanding. It is no wonder that the Shanghai Westerners team, which was once a dominant force, had to concede defeat. The lineups of the two teams yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Yuehua Lineup</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Feng Nianhan, Gao Taihan, Hu Jiwu, Wang Shusen, Lin Bingwen, Zhou Shaowen, Yang Renwei, Xi Qiaosheng, Chen Chao</p>
<p>Shanghai Lineup</p>
<p>Gotegen, Stock, Faping, Owen, Mauluo, Xu Fufeng, Tou, Kerr Qiao, Xing Kelai, Baudeng, Blaburg</p>
<p>Yuehua Gets the Ball at the Start</p>
<p>The bell rang three times and Yuehua kicked off the attack. After ten minutes of stalemate, Yuehua's Yang Renwei broke into the opponent's territory and passed the ball to Zhou Shaowen. Zhou returned to the center, but the opponent's two defenders were scattered on both sides and did not rush to the center, resulting in an empty space in front of the goal. Xi Qiaosheng took the opportunity to rush up and hit the opponent's goal. Yuehua won the first goal and their morale was greatly boosted. The Westerners tried to counterattack, and the yellow-haired Baudeng was very brave and attacked the goal. Zhou Xianyan turned the danger into safety. The Westerners changed their tactics and invaded from the left, breaking through Yuehua's second line of defense. Yuehua tried hard to resist and failed to take advantage of the situation to attack Yuehua's right side. Fortunately, Li Ning returned and protected the Jiangshan.</p>
<p>Gets the Second Goal in a Row</p>
<p>Yuehua was trapped for a long time, and Zhou Xianyan rescued many dangerous balls from the left and right. From then on, Yuehua turned from defense to offense. Chen Chao and Qiaosheng each tried wonderful shots, but they failed to hit the target. The Westerners launched a counterattack but failed to succeed. Xi Qiaosheng suddenly grabbed the ball from the feet of the enemy and plowed his way forward, clearing mountains and bridging rivers, and marched mightily to the front of the enemy's gate. Stock rushed forward to block him, but Qiaosheng skillfully挑球 to the right, and Chen Chao进不教武 (an idiom meaning "advancing troops before teaching them martial arts," implying ill-preparedness) was blocked again. So he passed the ball to the middle, and Zhou Shaowen kicked it in. The ball went into the goal for the second time, cleanly and beautifully. At that time, the Westerners' goalkeeper was focusing on the right side and was unable to turn around and save it. The first half ended and Yuehua won by a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>Everyone is Delighted to Get Three Goals</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, the Westerners tried to gain the upper hand and disrupted Yuehua's defense. Yuehua retreated the enemy with strong fortifications. Five minutes later, Xi Qiaosheng rode alone and charged into the enemy's territory. Two right defenders chased after him, rushing to the front of the gate. Qiaosheng snatched a priority and hit the enemy's gate, winning the third goal. At that time, the spectators were overjoyed beyond words.</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Rescues a Dangerous Ball</p>
<p>The Westerners, after suffering this setback, mustered their spirits and fought desperately. Yuehua's goal was suddenly surrounded, with a sense of being besieged on all sides. The Westerners attacked the goal more than 30 times, but fortunately, Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, and others bravely resisted and escaped danger many times. Finally, they were awarded a penalty kick. Fortunately, Sinclair shot well, and Zhou Xianyan calmly saved the ball, earning a lot of applause. The two sides struggled hard, and Yuehua was finally able to protect the country and achieve this miraculous feat with a score of 3-0.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Gold Market Subtly Declines Amid Swap Rumors</h3>
<p>Rumor that a certain bank with long positions is preparing to absorb cash.</p>
<p>Chinese merchants in British Hong Kong are selling short to acquire silver bars.</p>
<p>Weekly fluctuations of about fifty taels; last week's official gold price experienced extremely chaotic and unpredictable changes. Fluctuations of more than a few dozen taels were common, with daily differences of over twenty taels. Coinciding with the start of swaps, short positions continued to advance by three or four taels, resulting in a subtle decline, but the price remained within seven hundred taels. The overseas silver market and Shanghai exchange rates seemed to be circling, showing slightly different trends, causing confusion among colleagues and making it difficult to take action. Large players held vastly different long and short positions. As for the various news reports, they were divergent. The market was unusually weak at the beginning of the week, with the lowest price in May reaching 655 taels and 2 qian. Subsequently, the situation became unpredictable and turbulent. On Friday, it suddenly rose to 706.5 taels. Finally, the market closed at 696 taels. The total fluctuation for the week was 51 taels and 3 qian, a decrease of approximately 5 taels and 8 qian compared to the previous Saturday (excluding the 4 taels for swaps). The total net long position of large silver bar firms was 625, while American silver prices contracted by 25. The exchange rates listed by HSBC showed a slight increase of 25 for both British and American currencies. The internal rates of banks fluctuated. Chinese merchants generally sold in Hong Kong dollars to acquire silver bars. It is rumored that Chinese merchants have shorted about 4 million pounds in British Hong Kong dollars, but made some offsetting purchases at the end of the week, causing the market price to hover around 1 shilling and 4 pence. Although there have been no reports of cash exports recently, many who have not yet completed swapping from April to May are significant. Rumor has it that a certain bank has a huge long position of over 6,000 silver bars, preparing to receive cash starting April 1st. Also, Fuchang and others have not yet completed their swaps, and the net short position remains stable. The spot price is increasing by about 8 or 9 taels to over 7 taels, with the daily exchange rate exceeding the quoted price by a maximum of 70 taels and a minimum of just over 30 taels, resulting in a remaining discount of less than 60 taels. The total number of silver bars traded on the exchange is estimated at over 30,000. A summary of the week's events is recorded below.</p>
<p>Sharp fall at the start of the week, sudden rise on Friday: Starting on Monday (the 16th), large silver bar firms continued to increase their long positions by 3125, and silver prices increased by 375, so exchange rates followed with an increase of one and a half notches, and internal rates also loosened. Chinese merchants sold heavily. The gold market coincided with the swap date, and April was not traded as usual. However, the opening price was 679.2 taels and the closing price was 74.2 taels, a sharp drop of 23.6 taels compared to the previous Saturday. May has already entered the market. The opening price was 83 taels, and the initial swap was 3 to 4 taels, later 3.5 taels, still advanced by the long side. The market price was weak due to the large players selling off, falling from 87 taels to 73 taels. The afternoon was even weaker, breaking the 70 taels level, with an internal price of 668.3 taels and a closing price of 70 taels and 8 qian. The market situation weakened for three days, falling by about 40 taels. There were 18 or 19 taels of fluctuations on that day, which was a major drop amid the swap rumors. The next day, the large silver bar increased again by 4375, and the silver price increased by one minute and 125, so the British Hong Kong dollar followed with an increase of two notches, but then repeatedly contracted by two notches, resulting in a flat. The internal rates went from loose to tight. Chinese merchants sold first and then bought back, and Chengming was still good despite being flat. The gold market initially opened with a sharp drop of 10 taels and 8 qian, with the opening price at 660 taels. The situation continued to be complex. At 10:00 AM, large players frantically sold off, causing a sudden drop to 55.2 taels. Later, the exchange rate loosened, and both overt and covert rates tightened. The price jumped up by more than 10 taels, breaking through 70 taels. In the afternoon, various exchange rates strengthened even more. The spot rate closed at 1.4125, and industry insiders changed their bidding practices, so the price rose to 87.5 taels, closing 16.7 taels higher than the previous day. The market had a reversal after repeated declines, with a total of 32.3 taels of fluctuations. The large player Luo offset his short position and settled in spot, and foreign merchants who imported goods from Yuhang all chased after purchases, so the short side was suddenly attacked. On Wednesday, the large silver bar contracted by 25, the silver price decreased by one cent, and the spot rate decreased by one notch. The internal rates weakened. Chengming was overt, and covert rates were different, mainly because Chinese merchants were still eager to sell. The official gold price rose and then fell, and the fluctuations were still large, with changes of ten taels at every turn. The market opened flat, still at 87.5. Because the large silver bar contracted, YUancheng and Yuanmaoyong competed to buy, and the spot silver price was taken away by 13.9375, and then immediately rose to 97 taels and 8 qian. Later, buying and selling differed, so the price rose and fell at times. At noon, the price was only 75 taels, a sharp drop of 20 taels. The green speculator Wu and others competed to sell. In the afternoon, the price once fell to 73 taels and 2 qian because the Indian exchange rate fell and then rose again. Then, Dalian's bills reported large, and Shunli and Wanxing dragged them in, suddenly breaking through 80 taels to 81 taels and 8 qian. Finally, it was still in a soft state, closing at 75 taels and 8 qian. Hangyu and others sold out, which was 11.7 taels lower than the previous day. The total difference for the day was 24 taels and 6 qian. The next day, the large silver bar continued to decrease by 625, the silver price did not change, and the spot rate initially decreased by half a notch, but changed to contract by half a notch in the evening to balance. However, the internal rates tightened. Industry insiders first sold and then bought. The official gold price initially rose to 80 taels, and Wu and others sold off, causing a drop of 10 taels to 70 taels and 5 qian. Luo counteracted the short position and went long again, and the bank's buying price fell from 1.44375 to 1.40625. So at noon, the gold price rose again by more than 20 taels, breaking through 90 taels. In the afternoon, the price strengthened even more, suddenly reaching 703.5 taels. The closing price was 3 taels, an increase of over 27.2 taels compared to the previous day. The total daily fluctuation was 33 taels. Looking back, on Friday, the large silver bar fell again by 5625, the silver price decreased by 65, and the spot rate decreased by half a notch. But the bank's trading was lacking, and it was tight on the outside but loose on the inside. Industry insiders sold more than they bought. The official gold price opened low at 98 taels. In fact, there was talk of American support, and the situation in the Japanese cabinet was serious, so people's hearts became weak and the shadows affected them. Before long, the buying side's activities exceeded 700 taels. Then the big Wu and others sold off, and then shed more than 10 taels for a total of 709 taels and 5 qian. Noon closed at 701 taels. The exchange market was moderate. In the afternoon, it reached 706.5 taels. After the Indian exchange market saw lower prices, all parties sold off heavily, and finally broke through 700 taels, closing at 88 taels and 90 taels, a decrease of 13 taels from the previous day. The daily fluctuation was 18 taels and 5 qian. The speculator Wu sold off, while Luo bought in, so each went their own way. On Saturday, the large silver bar turned long again by 1875, and the silver price contracted by 125. The European market was quiet, and the spot rate did not change. The internal rates seemed firm. Industry insiders made some purchases and settlements. The official gold price opened flat, increasing by 1 tael and 5 qian to 691.5 taels. The prices fluctuated up and down, with the lowest being only 87.5 taels. The spot rate seemed loose, and could be settled at 1.4. Later, it tightened again and could only be settled at 1.3875. Large players competed to buy silver bars, and people's hearts were restless, causing a surge of more than ten taels, suddenly breaking through the 700 taels mark to 4 taels. However, Guangbang Hengxing and Shengda sold off heavily, and re-entered the inside, hovering only a few taels. At noon, the closing price was 696 taels, an increase of 6.5 taels from the previous day. The daily difference was 16.5 taels. The high and low prices of British, American, Indian silver markets, exchange rates, and official gold prices are listed below.</p>

Chinese buyers sold out, India also sold a little, and the market was calm. New York telegrams reported that the American silver price also contracted by 37, with the spot price at 2 jiao 9 fen 25.

<h3>Call Loan Market Also Shows a Good Sign</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, and there was no news. The market situation of the money houses seemed to be thriving. The interest rate for foreign cents was generally strong, with the morning market at 7 qian 2 fen 4 li and the afternoon market at 4 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half. As a result, it was 7 hao and a half higher than the previous afternoon. The silver call loan market also dominated, with both the morning and afternoon markets at 5 fen, an improvement of 2 or 3 fen compared to the previous day. Money houses collected over 24 million yuan in foreign currency, and public money houses collected over 3.8 million yuan. The transaction of silver call loan bills was over 5 million yuan. The early market for the transfer of foreign funds made 525,000 yuan, and the afternoon market made 810,000 yuan. The afternoon market for banknotes made 15,000 yuan, and the off-market banknotes in both markets made 100,000 yuan. The trading of small money houses was over 500,000 yuan. The early and afternoon markets for small Jiangnan foreign currencies were the same, with 6 qian 3 fen 3 li and a half, and the early market made 6,000 jiao and the afternoon market made 2,000 jiao.

Copper coins increased by 3,500 wen to 371,500 wen.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Increasingly Stagnant Last Week</h3>
<p>During last week, the securities market and various bond markets experienced sluggish spot trading. Only 81,800 yuan was traded for the entire week, including 24,700 yuan for 19 Customs, 18,000 yuan for disbandment, and only a few thousand yuan for others. The futures market was also lackluster. The market was depressed due to the dull environment, and bond prices were stagnant. Large players were observing the situation, so the daily trading volume was scattered, with the daily trading volume only between 4 and 5 million yuan. The total volume was 30.215 million yuan, a decrease of 2.5 million yuan compared to the previous week. Only 20-year cigarette bonds were slightly more active than before, accounting for over 7.72 million yuan, but still not as high as before. The trend of bond prices was also idle due to the quiet market. Large players did not make huge deals, and the market's supply and demand situation was very flat, making the market price more stagnant. The daily ups and downs were only a few corners. The total weekly fluctuation was only around one yuan, except for the 20-year cigarette bonds, which fluctuated by two yuan and a few corners. As a result, the selling momentum from zero households was quite active due to the weak buying momentum in the market, and bond prices tended to decline. If there are no new changes in the environment, it will be difficult to expect development in the bond market for a while. The high and low fluctuations of each bond price during the week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Weekly Report on Export of Chinese Yarn</h3>
<p>Affected by the waves of the gold market... the market atmosphere is volatile.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was quite volatile last week. The reason is purely due to the impact of the gold rush. The situation was complicated and confusing. But in reality, the market atmosphere is likely to stabilize because the price of third-grade yarn is high, and the calculated silver plate price has exceeded Chinese yarn by dozens of taels. Therefore, Japanese firms in this port are searching for spot yarn to be shipped to Japan. Shenxin and Yongan factories are increasing the amount of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and piece goods they are shipping overseas. This is a new record for Chinese yarn exports since the establishment of Chinese factories in Shanghai. However, domestic sales have not been very enthusiastic. Generally, before the implementation of the consolidated tax last year, various groups had absorbed a large amount, so the current amount is shallow. The various ports were slightly more energetic at the end of the week. The north moved slightly, and Sichuan also gradually became more smooth. It is said that they are currently negotiating the water freight issue. If it can be properly resolved, there will be a degree of actual sales development next week. However, most retail investors in the business field are trying to watch the market fall because the current demand is weak and the bottom goods have increased. However, judging from the world situation, there is no possibility of a major decline because the price of third-grade yarn is high while Chinese yarn is low, and the number of orders for Chinese yarn reaches a large number of five to six months. As for the factories, the cost of raw materials is high, and the cost of factory-required hardware has increased. With active export business, there is no concession to sell off to all parties, and most powerful big players are in long positions. If the market falls, there may be a purchase. If the spot yarn sales market can improve next week, there is a hope of rising. The total statistics of each group purchased during the week are 6,155 bales, 4,650 bales were traded among colleagues, and 4,020 bales were shipped abroad. The market for spot yarn has been rising and falling, and the results are strong. The prices for each month have increased by one or two taels compared to the previous week. The total transaction statistics are 143,900 bales. The number of bales purchased by each group is listed below.</p>
<p>Group Bales Group Bales Group Bales</p>
<p>North Group 150</p>
<p>Hong Kong 340 Tianjin 450 Yunnan 1,150</p>
<p>Korea 100 Mainland 1,550 Shantou 270 Sichuan 1,610</p>
<p>Xiamen 80 Guangdong 100 Nanyang 60</p>
<p>Japan 500 Niuzhuang 355 Jiangxi 120 Miscellaneous Group 340</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Slack Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market fluctuated last week, and was difficult to grasp due to the impact of exchange rates. The current sales of various factories were quiet, with no intention of operating. As a result, the situation was loose. The overseas cotton market was also calm. The Japanese company Tomi Cotton was advancing and retreating with the gold price. Its intention was softer, so there were more short positions at 40 taels and beyond. Because the bottom goods were thin, new sellers dared not act rashly. However, the current situation is that the flower market is weaker than the yarn market. The future depends on the gold price and foreign cotton. The price of spot flowers increased or decreased by one or two taels in the past week. As a result, the prices for each month increased by three or four cents compared to the previous week. The total transaction statistics for the week were 341,500 dan. The sources were 2,000 dan of Yao flowers and 1,000 dan of general flowers. The amount of spot cotton purchased by various factories was very small, only 7,360 dan. American spot cotton increased by 25 pounds compared to the previous week. The amount purchased by each factory is listed below.</p>
<p>Manufacturer Purchase Highest Price Lowest Price Transaction Volume Term</p>
<p>American Cotton 44.00 ... 1,300 pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 42.00 39.50 400 pieces Also</p>
<p>Taicang Cotton 41.00 ... 800 bales Spot Delivery to Suzhou</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rises by More Than Ten Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose due to good news from Liverpool and a lack of sellers due to purchases by colleagues. Futures rose by 10 to 13 pounds, spot prices rose by 10 pounds. British cotton futures rose by two points, spot prices fell by one point. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by five points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 21st):</p>

<h3>Dutch Increase in Entry Tax Case</h3>
<p>The Foreign Ministry Continues to Resist</p>
<p>The China-Netherlands Foreign Affairs Support Association telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the resident Dutch Agent Dai to continue to negotiate the Dutch increase in the entry tax case. The previous report has been noted. Now, it is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied to the association by telegram to continue the resistance. The original text is recorded below: The China-Netherlands Foreign Affairs Support Association is aware of the deleted telegram. The Ministry has repeatedly instructed the envoys to negotiate with the Dutch government and the Governor-General of the Dutch Indies on the case of the Dutch increase in the entry tax, and has also requested the complete abolition of the Dutch Envoy in China. However, the Dutch side used the excuse of universally applicable laws for overseas Chinese from all countries, and there was no room for expression. The resistance is still being continued in order to implement it. Sincerely, Ma Yin, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese from Nanyang Return to Investigate Commerce</h3>
<p>Departing on March 25th</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, believe that now is a great opportunity to develop Sino-South commerce due to the high value of gold and the low value of silver. Therefore, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in that area proposed the organization of a Nanyang Dutch East Indies Overseas Chinese Commercial Inspection Group to return to the country to investigate commercial products. Although it has only been established for a short time, the number of applicants is quite enthusiastic, which shows the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for the commerce of their homeland. The group will be divided into groups to return to the country. It is reported that Zhang Ming, the Consul-General in Java, and Zhuang Xiyan, the chairman of the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce, have also joined as members. The first group is scheduled to depart from Batavia on March 25th to travel and inspect the major commercial ports of Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, Beiping, Liaoning, Dalian, Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Charity Groups Welcome League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Hoping for Sincere Cooperation from All Nations</p>
<p>To Erase a Stain on History</p>
<p>The League of Nations' dispatch of a team to investigate the trafficking of women and children to the East this time is of great significance and can be called an unprecedented event. The day before yesterday, at 5:00 PM, the Chinese Child Welfare Association, in conjunction with all public charitable organizations in Shanghai, held a grand welcome reception at the YMCA Zhongshan Hall at No. 20 Museum Road to exchange opinions. Attendees included: Dr. and Mrs. Johnson (American, Chairman of the team); Dr. Binder (Polish, team member); Mrs. Schädter (Swedish, team member); Tang Hongzhu (Secretary); Xiao Jitang (Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs); Hu Yigu, Presiding Judge of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court; Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau (represented by Wang Jingyang); Borsedon of the General Police Station; Ren Wenmo of the French Concession Police Station; Chen Heqin, Director of the Education Department of the Public Works Department; Wang Yiting of the Charity Federation; Wang Xiaolai, Huang Xingjie of the Charity Association; Cai Yuanfu of the Zhabei Charity Association; Wang Zhongfu of the Women and Children Relief Association; Lin Kecong, Wu Ruohua of the Women's Association; Kong Shirong, Kong Zhongxian of the Jiliang Institute; Zhang Ruokang of the Shanghai Orphanage; Huang Jibei of the Puyi Vocational Training Institute; Pan Shilin of the Ci You Cultivation Institute; Mr. and Mrs. Fu Bulan of the School for the Blind; Lu Yigeng, Huang Zhenou of the Xin Puyu Hall; Chen Wenkui of the Shanghai Disabled Persons' Home; Zhou Shiying of the Anlao Home; Dr. Luo Yunyan of the Xinghua Newspaper; Dr. Le Lingsheng of the Jiaowu Magazine; and Mr. and Mrs. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Chinese Child Welfare Association; Mr. and Mrs. Wu Weide, General Secretary; Mr. and Mrs. Wang Guanyi, Chen Zhengfan, Zhang Yueru, and others, about forty people in total.</p>
<p>Dr. Luo Yunyan presided over the meeting and delivered an opening speech, stating that the trafficking of women and children is a common phenomenon in the history of Eastern and Western countries and can be called a major stain on the history of human civilization. Now that humanity has gradually awakened and is eager to eradicate this stain, the League of Nations has also established a special committee to handle the matter. We are extremely welcome. Now the League of Nations has sent an investigation team to our country, and today they are gathering with us, which is our great honor. We hope that you will not hesitate to give us your advice to guide us.</p>
<p>Dr. Kong Xiangxi stood up and gave a speech, stating that promoting humanitarianism is the responsibility of all mankind. Now that you have come from afar to seek fundamental relief for the unfortunate women and children, we sincerely welcome you. If you need our assistance in any way, we are willing to do our best.</p>
<p>Wang Yiting also stood up and gave a speech, stating that charitable organizations in Shanghai have always paid close attention to the trafficking of women and children, and often send personnel to investigate at the wharves and train stations. If anyone is found to be suspicious, they are immediately detained. If they have already been transported out before they can be detained, telegrams are sent to the military and police officials along the way to quickly find ways to rescue them. We dare not say that the existing prohibition methods are perfect, and we hope that you can provide guidance.</p>
<p>After the welcoming speeches, Dr. Johnson, in his capacity as chairman, stood up and gave a brief speech, stating that the team is very grateful for the warm welcome it has received from all parties since arriving in your country. The biggest purpose of this trip to the East is to collect facts and evidence and submit a comprehensive report to the League of Nations, so that it can fundamentally plan relief policies to bring happiness to women and children. It has become an open question in the world today. If all countries can cast aside pretense and cooperate sincerely, then the happiness of women and children will certainly improve, not only limited to prohibiting trafficking. During this visit to Shanghai, we have visited the works of various public charitable organizations and felt very satisfied. We especially admire the Chinese Child Welfare Association's ability to benefit Chinese children with detailed plans. If you feel any difficulties in the matter of prohibiting trafficking in women and children, please feel free to raise them at any time, so that we can convey your opinions to the League of Nations for reference.</p>
<p>After the speech, the attendees freely expressed their opinions to the team members. The team members also occasionally gave instructions. During the discussion, Wu Weide, General Secretary of the Child Welfare Association, raised the issue of extraterritoriality, stating that in order to completely prohibit the trafficking of women and children, the government must have unified administrative power. For example, in Hong Kong, Xiamen, and other places, the fact of trafficking in women and children is often discovered, but due to extraterritoriality, the Chinese government finds it difficult to enforce the prohibition. If all countries can abandon extraterritoriality in China as soon as possible, it will definitely be of great benefit to the prohibition of trafficking in women and children. The team members were quite moved and willing to convey this opinion to the League of Nations for consideration. The meeting adjourned at 7:50 PM after a group photo.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Recruits New Anti-Smuggling Soldiers to Shanghai</h3>
<p>A total of two battalions... transported from Haizhou to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to anti-smuggling in the reorganization of salt affairs, and the anti-smuggling soldiers in various garrison areas are too deeply entrenched in old habits, so new recruits are recruited for retraining. Yesterday, two more battalions of new soldiers were transported to Shanghai, and they will be transferred to Songjiang today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>One battalion transported by the "Tonghua": The Ministry of Finance recruited new anti-smuggling soldiers in Haizhou, with a total of two battalions and a quota of more than 2,000 soldiers. The first battalion, led by Battalion Commander Wang Tiemin, departed from Dapu, Haizhou on the China Merchants Bureau's "Tonghua" steamship and arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday. It docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf, and the soldiers temporarily stayed on the ship, waiting to land today and transfer to Songjiang by train.</p>
<p>A Batch Also Loaded in Xuzhou: The second battalion of new soldiers was transported to Shanghai by the China United Company's "Xuzhou" steamship because the "Tonghua" could not accommodate them. It departed several hours later than the first battalion, so the soldiers of the second battalion on the "Xuzhou" steamship were expected to arrive in Shanghai late last night or at 1:00 or 2:00 AM this morning. The ship also docked at the Nanshi Wharf. Both battalions of new soldiers must be sent to Songjiang for training before being stationed in the garrison areas. The officers and soldiers of the two battalions will land today and transfer to the South Station to leave Shanghai by train.</p>
<p>Collision of Two Ships: When the "Tonghua" was loading soldiers in Dapu, the "Xuzhou" steamship was also dispatched to the port to transport soldiers. When docking at the wharf, the bow of the "Xuzhou" collided with the stern of the "Tonghua" on the left side. Fortunately, the collision was light, so the "Tonghua" only suffered damage to the lower end of the outer side of the stern platform. Now the soldiers must disembark and the damage must be inspected and repaired today.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Promotes New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Deadline for Uniform Completion is July 1st</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has prepared for the implementation of the new system of weights and measures in this city and has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval with a deadline of July 1st this year for uniform completion. It has specially ordered all manufacturing stores in the city to stop manufacturing old equipment and convert to new equipment from February 15th. All vegetable markets in the city will start using the new system on a trial basis from May 1st. Since there are not many days left before the deadline for uniformity, it is urgent to proceed. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is instructed to inform its members to send representatives to the auditorium of the chamber at 2:00 PM on March 25th to discuss the promotion methods.</p>
<h3>Joint Defense Conference on the Coast Outside Songkou</h3>
<p>Will Be Established in Wusong</p>
<p>For the purpose of thoroughly suppressing bandits and consolidating coastal defense in Haimen, Chongming, Qidong, Nantong, and other counties outside Wusongkou, a joint coastal defense is being organized. If it is not protected, it will affect the national tax revenue. Draft regulations for joint defense and bandit suppression measures have been submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Security Office for record. Instructions have been received for approval within a time limit. It is reported that the county magistrates and representatives of various agencies will hold an inaugural meeting at the Wusong Fortress Taiwan Coast Guard Command and discuss the progress of bandit suppression.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Farm Director Attends Provincial Conference</h3>
<p>In order to discuss all important issues of affiliated agencies and decide on future directions, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines has scheduled a meeting of heads of affiliated agencies from March 23rd to 25th at the department. Ji Zhonghe, director of the Baoshan Farm and cooperative instructor, submitted four proposals after receiving the order: (1) Counties and farms that focus on cotton cultivation should also focus on breeding work to facilitate improvement; (2) Baoshan Farm faces difficulties in collecting, ginning, and promoting purebred cotton seeds due to lack of funds, and it is proposed to review the methods to facilitate progress; (3) Cooperative subjects should be added to rural normal schools to promote popularity; (4) It is proposed to improve the standards of agricultural banks for loans to rural cooperatives. Two proposals have been sent to the province for inclusion in the agenda, and it is reported that Director Ji has gone to the province yesterday to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of a Yellow Airplane in Wusong</h3>
<p>Landed and Repaired Before Flying Away</p>
<p>Yesterday at 10:00 AM, a yellow airplane suddenly arrived at the Wusong Fort Taiwan and soared in the sky. It landed on the Pujiang beach of the fort due to mechanical damage. For a time, the viewers were very crowded. At more than 12:00, the pilots repaired the machinery and flew south.</p>
<h3>The Ministry Approves the Revised Grading of Yarn Tax</h3>
<p>Chinese Yarn and Japanese Yarn Still Treated Equally</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn Mill Association previously stated that the tax on cotton yarn should be differentiated according to the thickness, with 10 and 16 counts as the center for Chinese yarn and 20 counts as the center for Japanese yarn. The same tax rate would inevitably be biased. It submitted reasons to the Ministry of Finance for approval to consult the Legislative Yuan to revise the grading according to the customs tax rate to show fairness. It is now reported that the association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance disapproving the original text. The Ministry of Finance states that the standardization of the tax on cotton yarn was first decided by the Legislative Yuan after collecting opinions from all parties, reviewing them in detail, and submitting them to the National Government for approval, promulgation, and implementation in all provinces and regions. It is not appropriate to change it. The association should understand the general principles and follow the central government's decision to reform and handle the new tax, and earnestly inform all yarn merchants to maintain national credibility. This is most important. Obey this instruction.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Term Limit for Unified Tax on Japanese Yarn Mills</h3>
<p>Limited to One Year</p>
<p>Funatsu Reports Back to Japan</p>
<p>It is learned from Japanese business sources at the Shinsei Newspaper that Mr. Funatsu, chairman of the Japanese Yarn Mill Association in Shanghai, returned to Osaka from Shanghai on the 10th of this month because of the issue of the unified cotton yarn tax term limit. After the National Government implemented the unified cotton yarn tax, both Chinese and foreign merchants were taxed separately. The Japanese yarn mills in China, with their factories in the concession area, could not directly apply the legal regulations. The Japanese factories in China were concerned about the government's abrogation of the contract, so Mr. Funatsu handled this negotiation. The remaining unresolved issue was the contract term limit. After repeated negotiations, the two sides gradually reached an agreement and officially signed on March 7. The date on the document is January 31, and the term limit is one year from then on. The term limit stipulated in this contract fully complies with the opinions of the Chinese side. The reason why Japanese merchants pay special attention to the term limit issue is that the unified tax collected this time may be increased at any time, so they tried their best to extend the application period, believing that the current tax rate is still favorable. Initially, Japanese merchants proposed five years, then gradually conceded to two and a half years. The Chinese government's policy originally advocated one year, but the government still insisted on the initial sadness. Mr. Funatsu went to Osaka to prepare a detailed report on the negotiation.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Dispute at Sanxin Yarn Mill Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>The problem of the declared sale of the Sanxin Yarn Mill in this city caused a dispute between the two parties due to the workers' request to resolve the aftermath, which has not yet been resolved. The following is a record of the continued news:</p>
<p>Letter from the Board of Directors: After the board of directors of Sanxin Yarn Mill held an emergency meeting the day before yesterday, Chairman Sheng Enyi and Director and Foreign Manager Yu Ci sent a letter to the mill's general manager, stating that the mill had been handed over to the Shenxin Yarn Mill. The factory manager was instructed to hand over on the 18th, but the manager and general manager refused to obey. From the 19th, they will be held responsible for any damage or theft of the mill's property, machinery, and materials.</p>
<p>Reply to the Board of Directors: After receiving the letter from the board of directors, the Workers' Union also sent a letter in reply, stating that at 4:00 PM on the 21st, they received an English letter from the director. Crane was young and had not read Western writings, so he was very panicked when he received the letter. He then asked a friend to translate it to understand the content. According to the transfer method, the time can be determined sooner or later depending on the size of the factory. In addition to the machines reported in the newspapers, there are still eight parts of the wire ingot and more than 100 old ginning machines in this factory, and both the yarn and cloth factories have sufficient accessories. A large number of old machine parts, raw and cooked iron, are not suitable for use and are stacked in the warehouses. There are more than 1,000 bales of yarn and cloth, and more than 4,000 loads of cotton. There is a huge amount of cotton that has not been made into yarn, and there are materials and coal worth tens of thousands of yuan and unpaid wages. Since the factory manager had not informed them in advance, they were not prepared for the transfer procedures. At the board meeting held at the company at 4:00 PM on Tuesday afternoon, the manager announced at 11:00 PM that the factory had been sold. The buyer came to the factory to take over at 10:00 AM the next morning and did not issue a shutdown order. I heard that he was very surprised and could not handle the transfer procedures in four hours. As for the full factory machines and houses, he has been responsible for safekeeping before Pinggong and Shenggong and will never shirk. There is no need to worry, but the safekeeping fee wages are estimated to be about 2,000 taels of silver per day. The silver should be delivered after the settlement of the workers' settlement issue. In addition, the director sent British and Chinese arrests, urging them not to interfere with the factory affairs and not to infringe on the freedom of the workers. If they do not comply, the director will be responsible for all the losses of the houses, machines, and goods, and is completely unrelated to He Ci.</p>
<p>Workers' Conditions: Yesterday, the workers sent Hou Jiahai, Gu Lansheng, and Tian Sanzi as representatives of all the workers to present three conditions to the board of directors: (1) At a minimum, each member of the union should be given six months of severance pay (a total of 3,716 workers); (2) Each person should be given a rent allowance for living expenses; (3) The 655 duty machinists, oilers, and male and female team leaders should be treated the same as the factory's staff and machine supervisors.</p>
<p>Workers' Warning: Yesterday, after the general manager received the letter from the board of directors, the workers sent another letter to the board of directors to warn them. The original letter stated that recently, I learned that you used the words of Mr. Sun He Ci to intimidate and attempt to destroy the last chance of the workers to survive, which is deeply regrettable. Since the problem of the sale of this factory occurred, Mr. Sun He Ci's every move represents the will and interests of all our workers. His actions are the actions of all our workers. If you take any unfavorable measures or damage means against Mr. Sun, our 4,000 workers swear to be the backing.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Order: Yesterday, it was heard that after the labor side established the Workers' Union, the order to handle affairs by dividing shares was orderly, and the protection of the machines in the factory was very careful. All personnel entering and leaving must wear symbols to identify and prevent the intrusion of bad elements.</p>
<h3>Native Cloth Industry Requests Continuous Maintenance of Export Transport Permit</h3>
<p>The native cloth industry in this city previously applied to the Unified Tax Office and the Unified Tax Bureau because customs duties were still required for the export of native cloth. The export tax-free transport permit was approved, but since the permit was obtained, the customs still collected taxes, resulting in significant losses due to the stagnation of goods. Moreover, the term of the transport permit is approaching, so yesterday I sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to submit it to the authorities for maintenance. The original letter states that our industry previously applied for a certificate for the tax-free export of native cloth, which was required by the customs for the unified tax, and stated in detail that the certificate for the tax-free certificate of this old-fashioned native cloth has no other documents that can be certified with the goods except for the approval order. The 10 million households scattered in the countryside are all poor people, and the power to purchase yarn is only a small package weighing no more than nine pounds. The source of the yarn is indirect and indirect, and the unified tax certificate cannot be obtained. I sent a letter to your association, asking you to verify it and submit it to the Unified Tax Office and the Unified Tax Bureau for inspection and handling. Subsequently, the Unified Tax Bureau issued a transport permit, and the Customs approved the shipment for export. Our industry has long been exempted from the tax on old-fashioned handmade woven native cloth. It is requested that the complete unified tax regulations be issued for the products directly woven after the payment of the unified tax, which has been separately submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Industry for notification. However, the customs has many threads for collecting taxes, and some still collect taxes according to the old rules, so I have made a statement of the previous situation. Now the association is ordered to pay customs duties for the transport permits issued to the merchants by the Unified Tax Bureau. However, it seems that this export of native cloth should not be taxed again according to the collection regulations, and it is not an unreasonable request from the association. The authorities have already allowed transportation to and from the market due to the relationship between the speed of transportation and the authorities. The industry still hopes that the authorities will maintain it from beginning to end and send another letter to the association to submit the difficulties of the association and try to grant an exemption. If there are any difficulties in the procedures, then the former exemption and the levied two will no longer be discussed. Counting from April 1st, there are not many days left. If it can still be maintained, it will be from the authorities' consideration and be infinitely grateful.</p>

<h3>Japanese Establish Factories in China</h3>
<p>The Economic Invasion is Terrible</p>
<p>The Continental Newspaper reported that Japanese manufacturers in Shanghai have been using low Chinese wages and cheap raw materials to engage in major activities in the local industry in recent years in order to eliminate the unfavorable effects of low silver prices. According to reports, since a certain Osaka trading company established a factory on Foch Road in August last year, a total of twelve Japanese-owned factory branches have been established, with a total investment of 800,000 yuan. They specialize in making felt hats and various cosmetics to compete with the goods of other countries. According to reliable sources, the Japanese will also set up factories in the interior of China.</p>
<h3>Yang Shengzhi Dies of Illness in Shanghai</h3>

Although the doctors tried to treat him, he eventually died in his Shanghai residence yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>News of the Reorganization of Inland River Navigation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction appointed Shi Zhaoji as the director of the Shanghai office for the reorganization of inland river navigation. Shi has been actively struggling in business for the past two months and has gradually achieved results. In order to further reorganize this matter and the rise and fall of inland river navigation, it is very important to share the recent news as follows:</p>
<p>Building Five New Ships: The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction's Inland River Merchants Bureau has a lease term of five years and is now in the process of starting. All of the more than 20 navigation ships are old and slow, and the cost of coal is huge, which is very unsuitable for new transportation needs. In order to fundamentally reorganize, Shi Zhaoji proposed practical methods to develop inland navigation. First of all, adding new fast engine ships would save fuel and generate huge revenue, which can be used to win the battle. A special request has been submitted to Director Shi Yingxian of the Department of Construction to borrow 100,000 yuan to add five new inland river ships and assign them to the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suzhou-Shanghai routes. The surplus business will be used to pay the principal and interest. The submitted document is expected to be approved. As soon as the funds arrive, the new ship styles will be drafted.</p>
<p>Lake Boat Trip Contracting: There are currently six companies competing for the Shanghai-Lake boat trip, called "regular trip", "non-regular trip", "early trip", and "afternoon trip". There are many ships and few passengers, and the six companies are competing too fiercely and lowering prices in order to attract business, resulting in a painful sacrifice for the Shanghai-Lake trip. The Shanghai Navigation Association tried to mediate between the companies last year, but it was ineffective. Shi Zhaoji changed his opinion and contracted the Shanghai-Lake trip to Lixing Friend from April 1.</p>
<p>Reducing Various Expenses: The monthly expenses of the Shanghai Bureau were originally set at more than 4,000 yuan. After Shi took office, he reduced redundant staff and saved various miscellaneous expenses. From this month, he has saved three-quarters of the various expenses, spending only more than 1,000 yuan. The day before yesterday, he issued a notice to further eliminate abuses.</p>
<p>Gonglong Case Dispute: In the case of the Gonglong ship sunk by the bureau, Shi requested that the captain and others be responsible for the dredging costs, according to the method of the Licuan ship aground in December last year, due to their negligence of duty, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the masters and engineers of the Liyuan, Hengsheng, Liheng, Hefeng, Hengren, Lihang, and Hengji ships, who jointly questioned Shi. Shi yesterday replied to the blackmailing sailors, detailing the reasons why the sailors should be responsible and ordered them to elect a representative to meet in person.</p>
<h3>Urgent News After the Sinking of the Changjiang Steamer</h3>
<p>Comprador Ling Hong and Others Report to the Seamen's Association</p>
<p>After surviving the disaster and returning to Shanghai on a French warship, Changjiang steamer comprador Ling Hong and others went to the Seamen's General Association to detail the circumstances of the accident. The general idea was that the shipowner of the steamer was a Frenchman named Cruchot. When the ship struck a reef, the bow was breached, and the people on board were thrown into chaos. The comprador immediately asked the shipowner to send a telegram for help, but he refused the first time. The second request was also answered vaguely, and the reason was unknown. He only saw the shipowner ring the bell and enter the engine room to reverse the engine. It was estimated that the ship sank in just twenty minutes (only half an hour from start to finish, which can be described as dangerous). At the moment of crisis, the comprador and others jumped into the sea, drifting east and west. Fortunately, there were two empty lifeboats floating on the sea, so they climbed onto the lifeboats and rescued the shipowner and several foreigners. Afterwards, it was found that eleven crew members and three female passengers had drowned. This was all caused by the shipowner's failure to send a telegram and reverse the engine. Although they have now been transported back to Shanghai by the French warship Marie, the responsible company, Lai Cheng &amp; Co., is completely indifferent and does not provide any relief. Regarding the crew members' request for compensation for losses, they only agreed to fifteen yuan per person. The crew members believe that the company has neither held the shipowner accountable nor cared about the crew, and they are extremely sad and indignant, requesting assistance, etc. It is said that Zhao Zhizhi, the director of the General Association, has agreed to send personnel to seriously negotiate.</p>
<h3>Female Passengers Who Drowned on the Changjiang Steamer</h3>
<p>One Named Zhao Sangu</p>
<p>Was a Cousin of Wu Chaoshu</p>
<p>Manager of Kangzhen &amp; Co. Among the three female passengers who drowned on the French merchant steamer Changjiang, one was named Zhao Sangu. According to Ling Hong, the comprador of the Changjiang steamer, she was a cousin of Mr. Wu Chaoshu, over forty years old, and lived in Haifang. Her husband had passed away, and she had an eldest daughter studying at a school in Beiping for several years. Recently, she had found a suitable match, and the wedding was scheduled to take place in Beiping in the middle of next month. She repeatedly telegraphed her mother to go to Beiping to take care of the arrangements. Zhao brought a maid and traveled in the first-class cabin in order to come to Shanghai and then go north. During the journey, the maid and the tea boy briefly described the situation in the north, so her life story was learned. Now, her daughter in Beiping is probably still unaware of her mother's death and is waiting for her. Another female passenger in the second-class cabin also boarded the ship from Haifang, but her background is unknown. (Riri News Agency)</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association's Report on Ninghai Construction and Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association received a report yesterday from Sun Yinting, director of Ninghai Construction and Disaster Relief, stating that 26 sections of the ancient ferry construction and disaster relief project in Ninghai, including the lower ferry, the ferry, and the outer embankment, have all been completed. A total of more than 34,760 yuan was allocated by the association, and more than 13,770 yuan was raised locally. A total of more than 48,500 yuan was used, and detailed statements have been prepared and reported. In addition, the five sections of the outer embankment of the upper ferry were requested by the village chief Xie Guocong and others during the construction process, requiring minimal repair costs of more than 14,000 yuan, with the local government agreeing to raise 5,000 yuan. The three ponds of the lower ferry village, Chuandong, Laopingyan, and Xinpingyan, were requested by Mr. Ye Zibu to be repaired, requiring minimal repair costs of more than 8,000 yuan, with the local government able to raise 4,000 yuan. The eight ponds that have not been repaired are all crucial. If they are not fully repaired, the repaired ponds in the middle, lower, and three ferries will inevitably be affected by the impact during floods, and the guarantee of more than 14,000 mu of cultivated land will be difficult to stabilize. The director came to the association to repeatedly discuss repairing these eight ponds, which would require an additional 24,500 yuan. In addition to the 9,000 yuan that can be raised locally, the association still needs to allocate more than 14,500 yuan. The project has reached this point, and it is difficult to stop it for the sake of conscience, etc. The association has discussed with Director Sun to find ways to raise funds to complete the project and ensure the long-term benefits of the fields in the area for a hundred years.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Xin Kang Disaster Victim Families Association Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Submitting a Petition for Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>The Xin Kang Steamer Disaster Victim Families Association, due to the case being suspended for two years without resolution, has, in addition to engaging lawyers Wu Jingxiong and Sheng Zhenwei to conduct legal procedures, recently decided to publicly appoint three committee members, Zhu Xiaoling, Zhu Youcun, and Chen Jicheng, to go to Beijing to petition the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Communications three times, requesting continued serious negotiations with the Japanese government to achieve compensation for all losses and the abolition of unequal treaties, the abolition of consular jurisdiction, and the cancellation of the right of foreign ships to navigate in China's territorial waters. The representatives took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing the night before last. The petition of the association is recorded as follows: The Xin Kang Steamer was sunk in an accident, and the delay has lasted for nearly two years. The bereaved families are in extreme pain, and they earnestly request consideration of their plight, continued serious negotiations with the Japanese government, and compensation for all losses to maintain national dignity and value people's lives. The China Merchants Bureau's Xin Kang Steamer was rammed and sunk by the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Tatsuno Maru on July 21, the eighteenth year [of the Republic], off Chengshanjiao Cape in Shandong Province, drowning 67 crew members and passengers and losing more than two million worth of goods and property. All the details have been reported to your seat. The Tatsuno Maru, relying on its large size and high speed, was negligent in driving, disregarding navigation lines, and destroying our shipping industry. If this is allowed to be delayed and unresolved for a long time, not only will the dead be wronged at the bottom of the sea and the living suffer in pain, but the wolf's ambition will become even more unscrupulous, and the harm of enclosed pigs and long snakes will be even more unknowable. What about national rights and people's lives? Although this case is already in legal proceedings, with consular jurisdiction not abolished, the Japanese are naturally fearless, and the date of resolution is truly unknown. The bereaved families, enduring hardship and pain, dare not avoid冒　to continue to elect representatives Zhu Xiaoyun, Zhu Youcun, and Chen Jicheng to respectfully approach崇階with sincerity and submit a petition, earnestly requesting your seat to俯　consider our situation and quickly continue to actively and seriously negotiate with the Japanese government to compensate for the loss of life and property, so as to appease the grievances of the dead souls at the bottom of the sea and comfort the boundless sorrow of the living. We also pray that you will follow the teachings of the Prime Minister and wish that the national public opinion will uphold the spirit of great fearlessness, abolish all unequal treaties in the international community, abolish consular jurisdiction, and cancel the right of foreign ships to navigate in China's territorial waters. The future of the party and the country is deeply beneficial and reliable. We await orders with urgent anticipation. (omitted below)</p>

<h3>Summary of Shaanxi Disaster Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Reply from the Relief Committee</p>
<p>The funds collected by the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association have been very enthusiastic in recent days. All the funds that have been pledged for fundraising or donations by various circles and groups have been successively paid due to the urgency of spring relief, and some enthusiastic people have paid in advance so that they can be handed over to Mr. Song Ziqiao to be distributed in Shaanxi as soon as possible for spring relief. Regarding the award of donations, the association had previously telegraphed the National Government Relief Committee to file a record first, and then submit a register of donor names and donation amounts for review and awards in accordance with the regulations after the matter is concluded. The National Government Relief Committee has now replied as follows: Shanghai Provisional Emergency Relief Association for Shaanxi Disaster Relief, Xun Jian Xian telegraph, I am deeply saddened by the severity of the Shaanxi disaster. I admire your association's enthusiasm in raising huge amounts of money. Your request to award the donors in accordance with the regulations should be approved and recorded. Once your association submits the names of the donors and fundraisers, they will be reviewed and awarded separately in accordance with the regulations to encourage and promote relief.

<h3>National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association Representative Reports on the Meeting of the National Academy of Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations is Preparing to Conclude</p>
<p>The Central National Academy of Chinese Medicine held its founding conference on the 17th. Many Shanghai doctors of Chinese medicine went to Beijing to participate. They have now returned to Shanghai one after another. The situation of the meeting of the Central National Academy of Chinese Medicine has been reported to the Shanghai National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations by Jiang Wenfang, the representative of the National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations, as follows: The representatives went to Beijing on the 12th of this month and learned that the preparatory office of the National Academy of Chinese Medicine was unable to hold the conference on the 15th because the number of attendees was incomplete. A preparatory meeting was held instead, so they were able to take some time to visit scenic spots and exchange opinions with representatives from various places, unanimously supporting the early establishment of the National Academy of Chinese Medicine. On the 14th, they received an invitation from the preparatory office to a banquet at the Jinlingchun Hotel at noon the next day, where a preparatory meeting was held immediately. Representatives and initiators participated regardless of region, so as to gather ideas and benefit from each other. That night, representatives were convened to discuss the association's conclusion method so that they could rush to handle it upon receiving the decree. On the 15th, a preparatory meeting of the National Academy of Chinese Medicine was held, with approximately two or three hundred attendees. After the banquet, Chairman Chen Yu stood up to report the purpose of the meeting and put forward three points: (1) The conference was postponed; (2) The method of producing directors; (3) The method of discussing proposals. The preparatory office meant that the first point was decided to be held on the 17th, and the second point was that the 49 directors would be equally divided between political and medical circles. The political circle would be publicly elected by the initiators of the political circle, and the medical circle would be divided and elected by the medical circles of each province and city, with one person from each province and two from each city. The third point was that because there were so many proposals, it was impossible to discuss them in the conference, so it was proposed to hand them over to the board of directors for handling. Then, the attendees expressed their opinions on the above issues and had a long discussion. In the middle, someone raised the issue of directors, intending to ask the political circle to set aside several seats for the pharmaceutical circle. The public believed that this would reduce the power of the National Academy of Chinese Medicine and was ultimately rejected. As a result, all issues maintained the original proposals of the preparatory office. Finally, the chairman asked the attendees from each province and city to present double the number of people and report to the preparatory office to be sent to the government for approval. In Shanghai, four people were presented, and the government approved two of them. The spirit of the meeting on that day was quite full, and Chairman Chen was able to handle the heavy burden with ease. On the morning of the 16th, the entire group went to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum to pay homage. Chen Yu presided over the sacrifice, presented wreaths, read the eulogy, and respectfully opened the tomb door to enter the tomb and view the statue. In the afternoon, the group went to the First Park to pay public tribute to the late President Tan and perform the ceremony as usual. On the 17th, the opening ceremony of the conference was held at the National Martial Arts Hall. Chen Lifu, Jiao Yitang, Wang Yongbin, Chen Yu, and Chen Dianqi served as the presidium. Approximately two hundred people attended, including representatives from party and government agencies and medical and pharmaceutical circles from various places. They performed the ceremony as usual, and party and state figures such as Wang Chonghui and Wang Yongbin successively gave speeches, generally　emphasizing the importance of the status of national medicine and pharmaceuticals and the pity of not revitalizing themselves in the past, and expressing infinite hope for the National Academy of Chinese Medicine. In the afternoon, the meeting continued and passed the regulations, generally based on the draft report. The names of the directors of each industry will be submitted to the government for approval, and March 17th will be designated as the memorial day for the national medical and pharmaceutical circles. All proposals will be reviewed and handled by the board of directors. This is a general overview of the meeting of the National Academy of Chinese Medicine. Regarding banquets, in addition to the preparatory office's lunch banquet on the 15th, Ms. Ge Yangmin hosted a banquet that night for party and state dignitaries and preparatory office personnel. Shao Lizi, Chen Yu, Chen Dianqi, Peng Yangguang, and others attended, accompanied by Xia Yingtang, Yin Shoutian, Gu Weichuan, Wang Zhongqi, Xu Xiangren, Lu Yuanlei, Xu Hengzhi, Lu Diansun, etc., which was quite a grand occasion at the time. On the evening of the 16th, the Nanjing National Medical Association and the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association hosted a public banquet for representatives from various places to fulfill the friendship of the host, which was deeply touching. On the 17th, there was a return banquet by representatives from various places to connect feelings. Looking at the meeting situation, the atmosphere was solemn and the feelings were warm. If the preparatory office had not presided over it properly and the comrades in the capital had not worked hard to assist, how could it have been so perfect? This is truly something that comrades across the country should be pleased with. The rise and fall of Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals is related to the prosperity and decline of culture and economy. The National Academy of Chinese Medicine bears the important responsibility of preserving and continuing it. It is not only hoped that the leaders of the National Academy of Chinese Medicine will continue to work hard and that the medical and pharmaceutical circles in various places will enthusiastically support it, but also that the general Western medical circles will eliminate prejudices and not restrict the progress of others, showing people that it is not broad and that national and people's livelihood depend on it. Representative Jiang Wenfang</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee resolved at its sixth standing meeting this month to abolish the National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations. The local National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Associations is preparing to complete the procedures within the day and has sent separate letters to the various trade associations today, scheduling a meeting for the afternoon of the 28th of this month to discuss it, and has also telegraphed the Central Executive Committee to clarify everything.</p>
<h3>Jin Xin Silk Factory Strike</h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies to Mediate Today</p>
<p>The National Society said that the workers of the Jin Xin Silk Factory in this city have been forced to strike due to various unreasonable oppressions by the factory.

<h3>Appreciation of the Matheron Concert</h3>
<p>The Magic of Ether Music</p>
<p>Professor Matheron, a famous French musician, has invented Ether Music after years of research. The musical instrument, also known as Air Music, uses electricity to produce sound, which is very different from ordinary musical instruments. Its pitch, tempo, clarity, and beauty are also superior to all musical instruments. It is truly a magical new invention in modern science that deserves our attention. Professor Matheron and his sister, Ms. Ginette Matheron, have performed their newly invented Air Music in various countries in Europe and the United States, and have received unanimous praise from listeners, and all major newspapers have also praised it highly. Professor Matheron and his sister recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan and performed at the Lyceum Theatre last night, which was a good opportunity for the ladies of Shanghai to appreciate Ether Music for the first time. Westerners made up most of the audience, with only a few Chinese. Mr. and Mrs. Korguin, the French Consul General, were also in attendance. After the curtain opened, someone first gave a speech introducing Ether Music and the exquisite creation of electric instruments. Then, Professor Matheron performed, and his sister, Ms. Ginette Matheron, accompanied him on the piano. Then, the unheard-of Ether Music slowly entered the ears and was appreciated by the audience. The Ether Music was clear, melodious, and free, and its tone was perfect, making people feel relaxed and happy. One piece of music was so distant and delicate that it seemed to come from the sky, which can be described as divine. No wonder the applause thundered after the end of one song. Professor Matheron will perform again tonight and will go to Hong Kong, Manila, etc. on the 25th to continue performing.</p>
<h3>Russian Musician Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Impoverished by Gambling, Suicide Due to Poverty</p>
<p>Last night at approximately 7 PM, a young Russian musician in the Westerner Apartments at 602 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession shot himself. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Operating a Dance Hall and Restaurant: A French merchant named Sabatier, who has been doing business in China for many years, opened the Charleston Cafe at 13-14 Rue Chu Pao San in the French Concession four years ago. At the same time, he rented a double-fronted Western-style house at No. 602, Lane 618 Avenue Joffre, and opened a small Western restaurant. Both businesses flourished. He housed all the foreign staff employed in the dance hall in his own restaurant for convenience.</p>
<p>Russian Musician Seminof: Sabatier's dance hall employed five Russian musicians, one of whom was Seminof, J. A. Semirnoff, age 28. He was young and handsome and excelled at playing the lute. In addition to his monthly salary of 180 yuan, he also received bonuses, amounting to about 200 yuan per month. Seminof was unmarried and lived alone in a small room in the back of Sabatier's restaurant downstairs, going to the dance hall every evening from 7 PM until after 2 AM the next morning before returning.</p>
<p>Extremely Proud and Courteous: Seminof was addicted to gambling, especially heavy drinking. Although he had a salary of over 200 yuan per month, it was not enough to cover his expenses, and he was often short of money. Despite his vices, he was extremely proud and neither borrowed from others nor acted rudely. According to the restaurant waiters, he was often in dire financial straits and walked when he had no money. He was very generous to rickshaw pullers and coolies. Even when he lacked the money to pay the waiters' tips, he would express his apologies, making people feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Discovered Collapsed in a Pool of Blood: Last night at around 6 PM, Seminof was drinking alone in his room and became increasingly intoxicated. Shortly after, he called a waiter in and told him that he was thirsty after drinking and asked for some tap water. After the waiter brought the water, he closed the door tightly. At 7 PM, Du Huchen, a waiter at the front door, suddenly heard a loud bang from the back of the house. At first, he suspected a light bulb had exploded. He then ordered a young Western boy to check the back. The boy saw that Seminof's room was unusually dark and the door was locked. He used a match to look through the glass window and saw Seminof collapsed in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>What the Detective Saw Upon Investigation: The Western boy was terrified and immediately ran to inform the restaurant's Russian landlady, Sabo Di. She immediately reported the incident to the Louza Police Station by telephone. The detective sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They found that the weapon used was a long Mauser rifle. It appeared that he had first lain on the ground and then tied a cloth strip tightly to the trigger, activating it with his foot. The bullet entered under his chin and blew a hole in his head, with most of his teeth knocked out. He was not yet dead.</p>
<p>The Reason for the Suicide: After the investigation, he was immediately taken to the hospital by car. He died less than ten minutes after arriving at the hospital. The hospital notified the police to report for an autopsy today. The main reason for the suicide was that he was impoverished by gambling and committed suicide due to poverty. According to the waiter, there was also a suicide note, which had been taken away by a friend who lived with him.</p>
<h3>The Ta Lun Land Case Remanded for Retrial with Definite Term</h3>
<p>Evidence Gathering Gradually Completed</p>
<p>Trial Opens on April 20th Afternoon</p>
<p>The Great China Department Store previously leased the land at the corner of Nanking Road and Fukien Road from the Ta Lun Land Company to build a department store. However, the tenants there were unwilling to move, preventing Great China from demolishing the old buildings and realizing their renovation plan. Ta Lun then filed a lawsuit against the tenants. Although the first and second trials were decided earlier, the landlord and tenant each won, and the result of the third trial was to remand the case to the second instance court for retrial. Therefore, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court resumed the work of investigating evidence. For more than a month, the points that the Supreme Court instructed should be investigated have been gradually completed, preparing for the opening of the trial. Yesterday, Hu Yi-gu, the Chief Judge of the Civil Court of the High Court, and the presiding judge, Li Mo, signed and issued a notice ordering the parties involved in the case to appear in court at 2:00 PM on April 20th to await trial. The Chinese and foreign property owners in this city have paid close attention to this case. In the past, every hearing had a full audience. This retrial is even more concerning. It is expected that the courtroom will be crowded again, and the lawyers from all sides will definitely engage in a heated debate.</p>
<h3>Female Student Drowns Herself in River</h3>
<p>No Progress in Studies</p>
<p>Fearing Brother's Scolding</p>
<p>Resorting to Death</p>
<p>Yesterday (22nd) at 11:50 AM, a case of a female student drowning herself in the Suzhou Creek near Robison Road in West Shanghai occurred. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Suddenly Developed厌世 (Yanshi, lit. "World Weariness") and Fortunately Rescued: Yesterday afternoon, near the Suzhou Creek on Robison Road, a woman of about twenty years old was first seen pacing around, then standing still and looking down, as if she had something weighing on her mind. Suddenly, tears streamed down her face, and she jumped into the Suzhou Creek. Fortunately, the beach there was shallow, and the tide was out. A boatman who was moored there saw her and immediately found a way to rescue her, sounding the alarm and bringing her back to the First Substation of the Sixth District, where Inspector Su personally sent her to the Sixth District Police Station for questioning.</p>
<p>Plain Clothes and Dignified Demeanor: The woman was wearing a Yuan-style cheongsam, cloth trousers, and gauze stockings. Her hair was not cut short and was styled in a small bun. Her attire was very simple and her demeanor quite dignified, as if she were a woman from the countryside, unlike the female students of Shanghai. When she arrived at the district, her clothes were still dripping wet. When asked her name and why she had tried to commit suicide, she only lowered her head and cried, remaining silent.</p>
<p>Shyly Concealing the Truth: After District Chief Ren comforted and persuaded her, the woman finally said her name was Cao Biyun, 22 years old, from Suzhou. When asked what was the reason for her attempting suicide, she continued to cry and refused to reveal anything. After District Chief Ren repeatedly comforted her, the female student only said that it was really embarrassing because she was dull-witted and could not make progress in her studies. She had no face to face anyone. If her brother (biological brother) found out, it would be terrible. She stammered the rest of her words. District Chief Ren felt sorry for her and borrowed clothes for her to change into temporarily, waiting for her family to be notified to pick her up.</p>
<h3>Principal's Semen-Sucking Case</h3>
<p>Soiled Pants Sent to Hospital for Identification</p>
<p>Wang Shijie, the principal of Xinguang School in Changan Road, Changle Lane, was sued in the local court by Wang Chen, the mother of student Wang Shidi, for sucking the student's semen, causing him to become ill and incurable, violating human ethics, and committing murder. After the court issued five summonses, Wang was arrested and detained. It is now known that no one has yet bailed Wang out, so he remains in custody. The case has been ordered to be continued this afternoon. At the same time, the judge, to prevent injustice, has sent the soiled pants presented by the plaintiff, with blood and semen stains, to the hospital for identification to determine whether the injury was caused by this, in order to investigate the case. Therefore, the rights and wrongs of this case are likely to be further investigated.</p>
<h3>Robbers Daringly Chase Pedestrians in Attempted Robbery</h3>
<p>Two Robbers Arrested in a Shack</p>
<p>Sentenced Separately After Interrogation</p>
<p>Yang Zhiqing from Gaoyou was walking on Guiyang Road at 7 AM the other morning when he encountered two robbers who intended to rob him. Yang fled, but the two robbers dared to chase him. A patrol officer saw this and fired two shots into the air. The robbers then ran into a shack to hide. Fearing that the shack was a den of robbers, the officer did not dare to act rashly and called the Yangtszepoo Station for assistance from a nearby police post. Armed Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the scene and entered the house together to search. They only found two robbers without any accomplices. They were taken back to the police station for questioning. The robbers were identified as Zhou Shaoqing and Luan Guangde, natives of Jiangbei. Zhou was a local hoodlum known by the nickname 克麥克 (Ke Maike, likely a phonetic transliteration) who specialized in roadside robbery. A few days ago, he and his accomplices had robbed a woman named Wang Guiying of her jewelry in the same area. The next morning, they were escorted to the Special District Local Court. Judge Xiao conducted the preliminary hearing. Yang Zhiqing described the circumstances of the assault, and Wang Guiying also testified that she had been robbed of a gold earring and slapped on the cheeks three times. She identified Zhou Shaoqing as the robber who committed the assault. Zhou not only denied the robbery but also arbitrarily slandered the plaintiff. Luan Guangde shirked responsibility in every way. After the interrogation, Judge Xiao ruled that the evidence was sufficient and sentenced Zhou to three years and six months in prison and Luan to three months.</p>
<h3>Two Suspicious Women in Railway Hotel</h3>
<p>Truth Revealed After Questioning</p>
<p>Originally Deceived and Forced into Prostitution</p>
<p>Escaped Together Due to Unbearable Hardship</p>
<p>The Women Who Forced Prostitution Were All Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Mingbao, a 17-year-old girl from Xiashi, and Xu Meixian, a 20-year-old girl from Wuxi, checked into Room 11 of the Railway Hotel in Gaoshouli, North Szechuen Road, the other night, paying one yuan for a night's stay. The next morning, Chief of Detectives Shang Wu of the Municipal Police Station learned about this and secretly investigated. Suspecting that the two women were suspicious, he took them back to the police station for questioning. Chen Mingbao claimed that on January 9th of this year, she was lured from her hometown of Xiashi by an old woman named Zhang Zhao to Shanghai and taken to the home of Wang Yang at 122 Amoy Road for a few nights. Ms. Wang ordered a woman named Lu Li to take her to the home of Zhang Wang, a woman from Jiangbei, at 589 East Tangjia Lane. Together, they sold her for 300 yuan to Guo Zhou, a Cantonese woman at 588 Ren Zhili, North Szechuen Road, to work as a prostitute, forcing her to receive customers. She had only received two customers in the past two months, and business has been slow recently, so she has experienced much suffering. She discussed with Xu Meixian and seized an opportunity to escape from the back door together at 7 PM last night to the North Railway Station, intending to take a train back to her hometown. However, the train had already departed, so they had to stay in a hotel temporarily to take another train back to her hometown tomorrow. Xu Meixian claimed that she had been a female worker in a Wuxi yarn factory. On February 8th of this year, an old woman from her hometown, named Lao Liu, also known as Mao A Da, told her that there were many yarn factories in Shanghai with high wages, and that she could earn dozens of yuan a month. If she went with her to Shanghai, she would be much better off than staying here. She was persuaded and came to Shanghai with her, arriving at the home of Yu Jinsheng in Yipinli, Baoshan Road. Yu then took her to the home of Zhang Wang in East Tangjia Lane and sold her for 330 yuan to Guo Zhou in North Szechuen Road to work as a prostitute. She had received a total of eight customers. She escaped with Chen Mingbao last night, etc. After obtaining the confession, the detectives led the two women to the above-mentioned places and arrested Wang Yang, Lu Li, Zhang Wang, Guo Zhou, and others. They also found five young Cantonese women at Guo Zhou's home and brought them to the police station together. The five Cantonese women all claimed that they were not prostitutes but had come to Shanghai to visit Guo Zhou. The police chief, because they denied being prostitutes, ordered the release of the five women. The remaining people were sent to the women's detention center. They were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court the other morning. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the police station, described the previous events and requested a postponement in order to summon the families of the two women to come and claim them. Xu Meixian also stated her previous situation and declared that she had been a child bride in the Xu family since childhood and had not yet formally married her husband, Xu Alin, and her father-in-law, Xu Ronggen, and her father's name was Li Shunqing. Chen Mingbao also proved everything. Judge Ge Zhitan questioned the defendants and ordered them to be detained again for further investigation and to summon their families to come to the court for another hearing in seven days.</p>
<h3>Chinese Invention of Long-Distance Wireless Radio</h3>
<p>Showberfeng Wireless Telephone</p>
<p>Can Receive European Radio Signals</p>
<p>Liu Zhongxi, Jin Zhirong, and more than twenty others formed the Shanghai Wireless Electric Appliance Company at 499 Honan Road in this city. Preparations were completed two months ago to manufacture wireless radio receivers and transmitters needed by the Chinese people. Recently, they invented the Showberfeng wireless radio, which can receive long-distance radio signals. Wireless telephone broadcasts from Moscow in the Soviet Union, Berlin in Germany, and Saigon in Southeast Asia can be received directly and very clearly. Liu Zhongxi has a 50-watt wireless telephone broadcasting station at 46 Yong Yuli, Lafayette Road in this city. Each time it broadcasts, it can be received simultaneously in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. In the past, the installation of such telephone equipment in China mostly relied on foreigners. Now, it can be installed directly by Chinese. The invention of the Showberfeng long-distance wireless radio receiver is especially a new era for the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Bai Beichen's Brother Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Bai Jixu, the brother of Bai Beichen, who committed suicide in the Yue You Gong Hotel, came to Shanghai from Beiping yesterday afternoon. He went straight to the Yue Gong Hotel on North Szechuen Road to inquire about the truth of his sister's suicide and wanted to go to the funeral home to pay his respects and find a way to transport her remains back. He told people that the marriage of his sister to Xu Xihe was actually introduced by Xu's sister, Xu Hua. Xu's original wife suffered from a cerebral congestion, so Xu married his sister, Beichen. The result today is truly unexpected.</p>
<h3>One Robber Arrested in South Fenxiang Robbery</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 18th of this month, at 1:15 PM, four robbers suddenly came to the Nanfenxiang Silver Shop outside the Dadongmen of the South City, each with a pistol, and robbed more than 2,800 yuan in silver dollars. They also searched for and took away the pistol of the petition police officer. They escaped without a trace. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that after the incident, the police station strictly investigated. Yesterday, the Second Division of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a tip that Gu Zhusan, a robber in the case, was hiding in Zhabei. Director Ma ordered Patrol Officer Wang to go to the Fourth District Headquarters with Patrol Chief Yu Majie to secretly arrest Gu at Tian You Li, Haichang Road. His wife, Bao, was also arrested. After questioning, Bao was found to be unrelated and was released on bail. Gu was detained at the Second Station of the First District for interrogation.</p>
<h3>French Concession Garbage Regulations</h3>
<p>Attention Residents of the French Concession</p>
<p>Director General Fuller of the French Municipal Council issued a proclamation yesterday stating that the garbage regulations established by this bureau are hereby announced: All households living in lanes must sweep their doorsteps clean every morning and pour the garbage they sweep into the covered garbage bins at the entrance of the lane or the intersection of the road. The workers of this bureau will then move the garbage into the garbage trucks parked on the road. The lane managers will then wash the garbage bins with water. There must be no garbage piled up or arbitrarily dumped on the ground. Each household must have a covered garbage bin for storing garbage at any time (the bureau has these bins for sale, and residents can purchase them from the bureau). This bureau prohibits workers from entering private residences (whether they are houses, lanes, or gardens) to carry garbage. Every morning, residents should move the garbage bins to the side of the road when the garbage truck passes by so that the workers can empty them. Garbage must not be arbitrarily thrown on the roadside, open spaces, or ditches. Before the garbage truck of this bureau has passed, the garbage bins must not be moved to the side of the road. After the garbage truck has passed, the garbage bins must not be left on the side of the road. This bureau allows the requests of landlords to have the workers of this bureau clear the garbage trucks in the private roads and lanes, but a garbage removal fee must be paid in advance every six months. The rates for this fee are determined by the garbage removal regulations of this bureau, which are divided into two periods: from April 1st to September 30th every year, the garbage trucks pass by from 5:00 AM to 8:00 AM every morning; from October 1st to March 31st of the following year, the garbage trucks pass by from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM every morning. The garbage trucks of this bureau have a bell. Residents should pay attention to the sound of the bell when the garbage truck passes by. Those who violate the above regulations will be fined one to five yuan. Repeat offenders will be fined double. Residents must know that garbage and filth easily breed mosquitoes and flies. Arbitrarily disposing of garbage on the road is harmful to public health. Therefore, this bureau sincerely hopes that residents within the concession will maintain cleanliness to promote health and ensure well-being. (Note) All items swept up by residents and kitchens can be transported as garbage. However, items such as leaves collected in gardens, filth from animal pens, and broken tiles cannot be considered garbage and must be disposed of separately. All residents within this concession must abide by these regulations. Do not neglect this important matter.</p>
<h3>Rampant Pirates Outside Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>Fishermen Dare Not Venture Out to Sea</p>
<p>Requesting Protection from Gunboats</p>
<p>Pirates outside the Wusong Estuary have become even more rampant recently. Pirate ships can be found almost everywhere on the seas. It is now the fishing season, but fishermen are afraid to venture out to sea because of the dozens of fishing boats looted by pirates last year. This is a lesson from the past. Therefore, after joint discussions among the fishermen, a small fishing boat was publicly sent out to the sea outside the estuary to pretend to be fishing in order to scout out the pirates' movements. Yesterday, the fishing boat returned and reported that it had encountered three pirate ships in the Tongsha waters and was forced to pay a fishery protection fee (the pirates forced fishing boats to pay dozens or hundreds of yuan for a flag, and if a pirate ship saw the flag later, it would not loot the boat). The fishing boat informed the pirates that it was the first time they had ventured out to sea, that there was no cash on board, and that they had not caught any fish. After pleading repeatedly, they were spared. The fishing boat then sailed to the Tonghai Jiejia waters, where there were even more pirate ships, so they dared not proceed further and returned. Fishermen are very worried about this news. They have already sent representatives to petition the Wusong Fourth District Seventeenth and Eighteenth Squadrons of the Water Police and the Coastal Defense Office to send gunboats and patrol boats to the sea to provide protection so that they can venture out to sea as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Five Opium Dens Raided in Half a Day</h3>
<p>Efficiency of the Laozha Police Detectives</p>

Du Lin, Yan and Yu Helian, two of the remaining four people, still needed to be investigated and were ordered to pay 100 yuan each for bail and to be retried at a later date. Wang Zhou and Ren Zhong'an were declared innocent. The opium paraphernalia was confiscated. However, Ta Enbo refused to accept the judgment and requested an appeal. Judge Luo ordered him to pay an additional 500 yuan in bail in addition to the original 500 yuan in cash for the case to be moved to the collegiate panel for a hearing.</p>

<h3>Man Jumps into River from Zhejiang Road Bridge</h3>
<p>Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>Died Not Long After Being Rescued</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, a man over fifty years old jumped into the Suzhou Creek from the Zhejiang Road Bridge. He sank and resurfaced repeatedly. A Chinese policeman, No. 64, from the Water Police Station saw him and immediately rescued him. However, he was barely breathing and unconscious. The policeman took him back to the police station and transferred him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Just as he arrived at the hospital gate, it was found that he had already died. The hospital then took the body in and transferred it to the autopsy office for collection. The deceased was wearing an old black cloth long gown, white cloth pants, and a sanitary shirt under the gown. He was wearing a small hat and had no money on his person. His face was full of smoking residue and seemed to be a person from the underworld. The reason for his suicide was probably due to economic pressure. However, because he could not speak when he was rescued, his name, age, and whether he had family in Shanghai are difficult to ascertain.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Commits Suicide by Hanging After Gambling</h3>
<p>Zheng Haijin, a Cantonese man, 16 years old, was an apprentice at the Mingming Pawnshop at 1201 Dixiwei Road. Yesterday morning, the shop owner gave him 100 copper coins to buy vegetables at the small vegetable market. Zheng walked to the market but saw a gambling stall set up on the side of the road. Overwhelmed by greed, he joined the gambling and lost all the money for the vegetables. He had no choice but to return with an empty basket and explain the situation to the shop owner. He was scolded by the shop owner. Zheng was very remorseful. In the afternoon, he hanged himself in the luggage room. People discovered him and tried to rescue him, but it was too late. He had already died. The Jiuxing Road Police Station was notified and ordered the police to go to the scene and transport the body to Tongren Hospital before transferring it to the autopsy office to await examination.</p>
<h3>Wu Lu Holds Onto Robber and Is Shot</h3>
<p>Three Robbers Steal Gold Bracelet</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 9:00 AM, Lu, the wife of Wu Ashun, was carrying a vegetable basket to the Cangqiao small vegetable market to buy vegetables and return home. When she was walking in the 　xiang lane, about four or five doors away from her home, three robbers suddenly came from behind and stopped Wu's wife. They took out weapons and threatened her not to make a sound and forcibly stole the gold bracelet that she was wearing on her hand. Wu's wife saw that the bracelet was stolen and immediately grabbed the robbers and shouted for help. One of the robbers then shot her, the bullet entering through her leg. Wu's wife fell to the ground in extreme pain after being shot. Residents nearby heard the sound and came out to see what was happening. The robbers carried the stolen goods and fled towards Zhenzuo Street. The nearby police officers were notified and followed to arrest the robbers, but they had already disappeared. Neighbors helped her up and sent her to the South City Hospital. The doctor managed to remove the bullet and reported to Wu, who in turn reported to the Third Station of the First District Police Bureau for arrest. It is said that one of the robbers had been following her from the Cangqiao small vegetable market, but she had not noticed it.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am astonished to read in your newspaper on the 20th of this month under local news of the article concerning the China Industrial Society infringing upon patents. The China Storage Battery Factory applied to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for a patent, claiming the manufacturing method of dry batteries with common small powder in the market as an invention, and prohibiting other companies from operating. The lawsuit against the company has already been settled by court mediation. The sealing of assets is purely fictitious. I hereby send this letter as a representative to request a correction.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>A Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Chifo</p>
<p>▲ A tower of love built with golden sand may shine brightly for a moment, but will eventually collapse.</p>
<p>▲ Cupid has two wings, so he is easy to come and easy to go.</p>
<p>▲ When the fire of love rages, cruelty is born in the heart, which is why people commit suicide for love. When Taiwanese aborigines bid farewell to Han Chinese, they often tap them on the head to show affection. The cruel psychology of mankind is innate.</p>
<p>▲ The thorns of love are more numerous than roses, and the taste of love is as astringent as olives. Only through the thorns can its fragrance be seen, and only through astringency can its sweetness be seen.</p>
<p>▲ Only in poverty do we taste the flavor of love, and only in illness do we know the truth of love. To make poverty and illness a reason for divorce is to imagine the value of their love.</p>
<p>▲ The Tathagata and Guanyin are both depicted as beautiful women, simply to say that we should have a beautiful woman who studies Buddhism in our hearts.</p>
<p>▲ A confidant is a comfort in life. Seeking a confidante of the opposite sex is nothing more than obtaining a comfort.</p>
<p>▲ Flowers that can understand words are enough to captivate a city, but stones that cannot speak are difficult to call lovely. A woman with beauty but without talent, or with appearance but without learning, is merely a flower or a stone.</p>
<p>▲ Most men are unreliable. Even Shuangwen in this world cannot avoid beginning with affection and ending with abandonment. Therefore, how should a woman be careful of her whole life?</p>
<p>▲ Chifo is old. For him to talk about love with thorny words is like an old woman wearing flowers, only increasing her ugliness.</p>
<h3>New Talk on Curly Hair</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Since women cut their hair, the trend of curly hair has gradually become popular. Every time I see so-called modern girls, their green hair is all curved, either spiraling or undulating like waves. Some are even fluffy and disheveled, dressed like Western beauties, contrasting with their powdered faces, making them feel extraordinarily romantic, making people dare not look at them directly like Liu Zhen.</p>
<p>Young European women tend to decorate their hair, and the most beautiful are those with golden yellow hair, with strands hanging down in curls, parted on the left and right, fully displaying their beauty. If they are a little older, they usually have it styled in waves. The tools for perming hair rely entirely on the heat of the tongs. The heat is high, so the hair is pressed to curl into waves. The best surgery results in shiny and consistently folded hair, but the time required is longer than ordinary haircuts.</p>
<p>Hair can also be permed at home, using an electric comb invented in England recently. The teeth are sparse and curved, made of metal and plated with nickel. The handle at the top contains a battery. It is said that the electricity is very light and can only perm the hair to make it curl without fear of touching the skin and getting hurt. The method of use is very simple. Just comb it as usual, without any extra steps, and the permed hair is neatly and consistently wavy, as if it were done by a famous hairdresser. If this comb becomes popular at sea one day, I know that fashionable girls will definitely rush to buy it, and the livelihood of hairdressers will be greatly affected. Some people also have natural curly hair, such as the short and curved hair of Africans. When I was young, my hair was black and straight, but unexpectedly, when I reached middle age, it became wavy. I have never permed my hair or used styling products, but every time I wash and comb it, it shows waves after it dries. I asked a doctor friend who is usually a doctor about it, and he only said that it was related to the skin, but he never made it clear.</p>
<h3>Zhu Ziqiao Leans on Luggage to Write Couplets</h3>
<p>— Chou</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Ziqiao has come to Shanghai to appeal to all sectors because of the particularly heavy Shaanxi disaster. His enthusiasm has led to the joint establishment of the Shanghai Temporary Emergency Relief Association for the Shaanxi Disaster. In less than two weeks, 200,000 yuan has been donated. At a time when commerce is sluggish and finance is tight, this achievement is not easy. It is said that there are still several places that are being mobilized, and it is estimated that more than 100,000 yuan can be donated in the future. This is all the result of Zhu Qun's usual enthusiastic handling of affairs and personal disaster relief. Mr. Zhu is sincere and amiable. This time, he stayed at Yipinxian for more than ten days, running around to various places during the day and writing couplets for friends at night, without a moment to spare. On the evening of the 19th, before he left, Zhu Jianxia, the principal of Qinyi Girls' School, forced him to write a couplet. He leaned on his luggage and wrote the ten characters "Only forbearance can help, and his virtue is enough to accommodate." He threw down his pen and rushed to the station by car, only five minutes before the train was about to leave.</p>
<h3>Banana Peel Mischief</h3>
<p>— Xi Yan Chong Lai Ke</p>
<p>During the Lantern Festival, I met Jin Er, an old servant from ten years ago, on the way to Lin'an. He asked about my current situation and location. I happened to buy a banana and ate it because of a toothache. Jin Er suddenly arrived, smelling of alcohol. He asked a few questions and left in a hurry, picking up the peeled banana peel. At that time, I thought he had not forgotten his old service and praised him deeply. Soon after, he came back in a panic, begging for ten pieces of flatbread, asking what he needed. He whispered, "The banana peel is causing a lot of trouble." I said, "How can a banana peel cause trouble for people? It must be you who are asking for trouble. Where do I get so much money?" I gave him five pieces and asked him to get to the bottom of it. Only then did I realize that the banana peel could not cause trouble for people. It turned out that Jin Er came to Shanghai from Zhejiang to handle housework. He happened to meet a colleague, Mr. Ye, who was celebrating his wedding. Many guests gave bananas as gifts. Jin Er was surprised. The guest told him that the two newlyweds did not know each other at first. One day, the bride was helping her old mother walk down the road when her mother slipped on a banana peel and fell. There was a porcelain stand beside the road, and the mother's head was only inches away from touching the porcelain. The bride almost fell too. She saw someone save her mother from danger and thanked him quickly. That person is today's groom. The mother and daughter were grateful and saw that he was handsome and charming, so they asked someone to be a matchmaker and made a good match. Therefore, the guests competed to give bananas to tease them. Jin Er was drunk and full and suddenly remembered that I lived nearby, so he came to ask me. Seeing the banana peel, he happily picked it up, wanting to use it as a tool to make trouble in the bridal chamber, so that the groom would kneel on the banana peel to pay homage to the bride. Unexpectedly, he was slightly drunk and staggered. The banana peel fell to the ground. It happened to cause a child of a certain surname to slip and bleed. The situation was very dangerous. The patrolmen caught him and detained him in the police station for two days. Fortunately, the child was unharmed, but he could not escape the fine of ten yuan. Because he had no money, he asked someone to vouch for him and raise the money. Alas, jokes are useless. The banana itself cannot cause trouble for people, nor can it bring good fortune. It has achieved a good match and led to punishment. The banana cannot bear to receive virtue or bear to receive resentment. Write it to show persuasion and punishment.</p>
<h3>Fragments from the Yangtze River Disaster</h3>
<p>— Fact</p>
<p>The French steamer Yangtze ran aground in the Min Sea. The details have been reported in major newspapers. Here are some fragments of news:</p>
<p>▲ Shipowner Cuts Open the Ship's Belly: The Yangtze River steamer ran aground at 2 PM on the 16th. Normally, it would not have resulted in loss of life. However, the ship struck a hidden reef outside of Beiyushan, and the reef lodged in the second cabin. If the ship's body had not moved, all lives could have been saved, and the large sum of money inside could have been taken out. However, shipowner Criquo was informed and ordered the engine to reverse, saying that it could retreat from the dangerous reef. Unexpectedly, when the engine moved, the reef under the ship's bottom immediately divided the ship's belly into two. The two cabins became two pieces of the ship's body, which immediately sank without a moment's delay.</p>
<p>▲ Female Passengers Grab Lifeboats: Three Cantonese female passengers who came to Shanghai by boat from Hong Kong rushed to the deck to grab the lifeboats when the ship ran aground. They seized a lifeboat. According to regulations, the hanging rope must be cut off before it can be lowered into the sea. However, at that time, the ship was gradually level with the sea, and there was no knife available. Only the outer blocking rope was untied, and the inner blocking rope could not be untied. It was agitated by the waves and the lifeboat overturned. The three female passengers fell into the water and disappeared without a trace, joining Dr. Wu.</p>
<p>▲ Swimming Thirty Feet: The ship sank in just ten minutes. The ship's staff and passengers escaped on eight lifeboats. Unexpectedly, all eight lifeboats capsized. More than seventy people fell into the sea. The place was more than ten feet away from Beiyushan and about thirty feet away from another small island. Everyone swam to the island in the sea. Five passengers were lucky to be able to swim. Firemen helped them ashore. Eleven crew members who did not know how to swim sank into the sea as soon as they went into the water.</p>
<p>▲ Cockle Shells Stab People: The small island was covered with seashells from top to bottom. All the shells were sharp like knives. When over fifty escaped men arrived at the small island, they had all lost their shoes. All of them were barefoot, and their feet were stabbed. Some even had their heads knocked into the shells and suffered great injuries. When everyone arrived in Shanghai yesterday, they were all wrapped in bandages. One person's shell injury was extremely serious and very dangerous.</p>
<p>▲ Hunger and Seeking Fish to Eat: When the staff escaped to the small island, their clothes were all wet and there was no food. After sixteen or seventeen hours, they were hungry and cold. There was nothing they could do but to catch small fish on the island beach and eat them raw to fill their hunger. One person who could not live without smoking was even more miserable because he had no cigarettes to smoke. The next day, after being rescued by the villagers of Beiyushan, he asked for cigarettes everywhere to satisfy his addiction. This is also a special hobby that harms people.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Dollars Sunk in the Sea: The ship had 180,000 yuan in silver dollars sent from Hong Kong to Shanghai by remittance companies on behalf of customers. Every 5,000 yuan was packed into a box, for a total of more than thirty boxes, which were also sunk in the silver warehouse in the middle cabin. The crew and staff regretted this very much. It is heard that a certain company that lost the money plans to entrust Japanese people to salvage it so that this huge sum of money will not be sunk in the sea forever and suffer a major loss.</p>
<p>▲ Enquiring About the Ship's Whereabouts: The ship was lost on the 16th and was not discovered until the 18th. Although Shanghai received the news, it could not know its whereabouts. Even the manager, Kang Zhenji, was busy for two days, entrusting the China Merchants Group, American ships, and radio stations to inquire about its location. It was not until the French warship received a telegram from a Japanese ship that they knew it was at the junction of Wenzhou and Fuzhou, 200 nautical miles from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Singing Girl Red Peony is Definitely Worth Seeing</h3>
<p>— Ge Gongzhen</p>
<p>Sound films are becoming more and more popular every day, but all the ones we have seen are imported. Regardless of whether people who don't understand foreign languages are confused, even those who understand may not be able to fully understand because the dialogue often contains slang. Therefore, when we seek pleasure, we feel the pain of different races and languages. Fortunately, domestic sound films have been released, and "The Singing Girl Red Peony" is definitely worth seeing because the script of this play is very good and can use negative writing to depict social truths. Therefore, the scenes are reasonable and touching. The last two sentences ["It's just a shame that she didn't receive an education and sang old operas too much"] are the finishing touch and the most powerful. Ms. Hu Die and Mr. Wang Xianqi also performed their abilities very well in this play. When they performed the tragic parts, people couldn't help but shed tears of sympathy. In particular, Ms. Hu's dialogue is very clear and pleasant, which greatly increases the value of this sound film.</p>
<p>Although this play is a sound film, there are several places that are silent and very effective. For example, when the woman says goodbye to the man in prison, the man has a tendency to discover his conscience. This is a deep and faithful depiction that we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Although the colleagues of the People's Company have spent a lot of effort and money on this play, and they have not been afraid to reshoot the unsatisfactory parts, they can be comforted by the result.</p>
<p>I hope that the government or social groups can know the power of film in the people's side, and they should often supervise and facilitate the Chinese who make films so that they can make more educational films that are not purely for profit.</p>
<h3>Travels in India (II)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 18th, the secretary of the Buddhist Association, Simhan Devapriya Walisinha, returned from Sana. I gave him a letter from Burmese Kyaw Hla and Wgahwatte from Mandalay. Mr. Simhan studied in England for two years and met Taixu in London and held a welcoming party. He has just returned from England and is now supervising the project in Sana before returning. He told me the story of the Buddhist sites in Sana. Sana (Sarnath Nepalin), Nepal, was originally the place where the Buddha turned the Dharma wheel for the first time after enlightenment, that is, the Deer Park where he first preached and enlightened the five bhikkus Ajnatakaundinya, etc. Now the first Buddha and university Sarnath Buddhist Temple &amp; College are built here. The place is more than 400 miles away from Jia City. On the way, it passes Bodhi Gaye, where the Buddha renounced his family and practiced the Dharma. The Lotus Sutra says, "Renouncing the family is near Gaya." Mr. Xin is knowledgeable and plans to travel to China and Japan in a year.</p>
<p>On the 19th, I met the old philosopher Krishna Kumar, who expressed his welcome and performed the Indian greeting for me, holding hands and performing it. In addition, Indians and Indians also perform the waist-hugging ceremony. The philosopher is a Hindu who has been running a newspaper for 50 years. His daughter is good at English and has written many works. He called his three daughters out to meet. After this, he introduced me to many friends.</p>
<p>On the 20th, Mr. S. C. Khasnabis M. A., the editor of the Buddhist Association's monthly magazine, visited the university here with the same people and met with the president, Rarhakrishnan, and many teachers, including Kasyapa. The spelling of Indian names is complicated and difficult for us to remember. It is more complicated than Western writing. One name has seven or eight syllables, and one person's name is used for three or four words, up to twenty syllables, while Chinese names are limited to three syllables, so it is very inconvenient for us to remember them. I talked about cultural exchange and advocated that universities around the world exchange professors and students as the first step in cultural communication. In each classroom of the university, there are few students, as few as three or two, and as many as dozens. There are female students, and most of the teachers are old, with long beards and sitting on the upper seats with the dignity of a teacher, and the students listen quietly. The state of the students is almost like that of workers in our country's factories. Except for a few female students whose clothes are quite clean and beautiful, female students love beauty naturally, and a group of men hardly have time for this, and the Indian style is close to nature and is not necessary.</p>
<p>I have been studying the style of Indian clothing for a long time, and I suddenly realized that it is not necessary. The temperature is still 70 degrees in the winter. I have to take a bath twice a day, otherwise I will itch. If it is extremely hot in the summer, who would want to wear clothes? Therefore, the teachings of the Nigantha do not hang an inch of silk, and Buddhism teaches people to expose their right shoulders. It is a reconciliation method. Ordinary gentlemen now also wear a blanket on their shoulders to attend the conference. According to statistics, Indians never wear hats, and their bare heads are accustomed to and transformed by the sun. There are occasionally small melon hats, but they do not cover the sun. The upper body is also usually not wearing clothes, and the lower body is barefoot as a courtesy, and wearing shoes is a great disrespect and cannot enter the temple. In the whole body, remove the head and feet, and there is no one wearing pants on the legs, but wrapped in a piece of cloth. The cloth can be a large piece or a small piece, only a piece of cloth belt can cover the front and back genitals. The immortals who practice Taoism today are still like this. The image of the great saint Gandhi is only a belt covering the front and back genitals. The life of Indians is like this, so the teachings of great liberation must flourish in India.</p>

<h3>European War Diary (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The French Ninth Army, Forty-second Division, and cavalry regiment fought continuously from October 23rd to November 15th, and were not relieved until a few days later. The hardship and dedication were evident.</p>
<p>In the Battle of Ypres, the front line extended for twenty-eight miles from Lake to Amentières on the Lys River. The German army had a total of fifteen army corps, while the Allied forces had only ten. On November 31st, the French army defended a front line of fifteen and a half miles, and the British army twelve and a half miles. On November 5th, the French army defended a front line of eighteen and a half miles, and the British army nine and a half miles. From the length of the front line and the number of soldiers, it can be seen that the French army had to undertake most of the fighting, so it is said that the British army cannot claim sole credit for the victory of Ypres.</p>
<p>Both sides suffered heavy losses. The Germans used heavy artillery that the Allied forces could not match in the hope of conquering us. Some of the cannons we used to resist the German heavy artillery were fifteen inches in diameter. The German reserves were especially enthusiastic, but when they encountered the persistence of the opposing army, they could not help but panic. These soldiers were driven into the firing line amidst shouts and attacked fiercely, resulting in a great massacre. Their morale was greatly affected...</p>
<p>In the days after the victory of the Marne, our strategic encirclement continued to develop, and we had to expand the front line from Switzerland to the North Sea, a distance of four hundred and twenty-five miles, which was unprecedented in history. Moreover, six weeks after the Battle of the Marne, we had to temporarily deal with a new battle and a decisive battle at the northern end of the front line.</p>
<p>The result of such a battle naturally aroused serious fears at first, because the enemy had long prepared huge military equipment and stored huge amounts of ammunition in peacetime, giving him a formidable advantage since the beginning of the war. We lacked manpower, and military equipment and ammunition were even more scarce, so we had to deploy our own army and the front lines of the Allied forces. This was the situation in which we faced the enemy, and we finally overcame the difficulties with concerted efforts. However, the result of turning danger into safety was mostly due to the attention and decision-making of the commander-in-chief, who resolutely sacrificed his own army to fill most of the Allied front lines.</p>
<p>The result of this battle is noteworthy. The Allied forces inflicted a blow on the enemy on the banks of the Yser River and at Ypres, which first crushed him. We then moved east to conquer Russia, but the plan was dashed and the enemy's invasion and occupation of the rich areas of northern France was avoided. The Straits and the ports of the North Sea were protected, maintaining communication between Britain and France, allowing Britain to avoid German attacks and preserving Belgian territory, maintaining its place on the map of Europe, and its government outside the enemy's sphere of influence.</p>
<p>The Allied forces participated in this battle and held out for a month. The victory was finally achieved due to their close cooperation. Under such circumstances, solidarity in times of adversity and sacrifice will definitely make the friendship between the three countries even stronger. This is the valuable asset on the Allied balance sheet.</p>
<p>The German attempt to remedy the situation was to intensify the bombardment of Ypres. On November 22, they targeted St. Peter's Church and the Cloth Hall as the targets of their ruthless shells. These magnificent buildings were reduced to ruins in an instant, leaving only a sigh for future generations.</p>
<p>The Battle of Ypres further proves the power gained by defensive warfare through artillery fire, especially the development of machine guns. Offensive warfare has not gained such an effect. The long-term confrontation between the two armies has produced a new tactic, which is positional warfare as opposed to so-called mobile warfare. This is really nothing more than a temporary crisis in the war. A well-equipped and well-trained attack is powerless to defeat the defense, admitting its weakness.</p>
<p>Seeing the progress of aviation and the development of chemical warfare, the future struggles will be endless. Therefore, to prepare for the Second World War, we must first pay attention to the formidable materials used in the war, at least a part of which must be stored in peacetime, and then create a military organization so that it can be used well in wartime.

<h3>Novel Principles</h3>
<p>— Su Chu</p>
<p>Written by Chen Muru, published by China Book Company</p>
<p>Chinese new literary works have reached a certain level of development, especially in the creation of novels, which almost floods the domestic publishing industry. Regarding the value of the content, we will not comment for now, but there are very few books on novel principles in China, especially works by Chinese writers themselves who have researched and developed their own insights. What exists are only fragmentary compilations of Western novel principles, reorganized and mixed together, which of course can only serve as a reference for general novel enthusiasts, and their content mostly does not conform to Chinese national conditions. We consider this our only defect. Even the definition of a novel differs from person to person, and it is difficult to obtain a complete and accurate definition. Therefore, the author of this book expressed some of his research insights in the preface. He said: "A novel is a reflection of the background, people, and lives of everything in society. It uses the most effective narrative writing to depict the pain, misery, joy, comfort, cruelty, jealousy, terror, anger, and life and death within it... In this writing, the author must use artistic means to reveal fragments of real life and convey his experienced emotions to others in order to arouse their sympathy. Works that are so exhaustively and nakedly described are called novels." The author's explanation of the definition of a novel is certainly worthy of our study, especially before the general creators in China have set an accurate definition of a novel, the author's contribution of such self-research results is indeed something we agree with. Therefore, the content and value of this book can also be glimpsed as a very meaningful book on novel theory.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into fourteen chapters, and the distribution is extremely appropriate. It completely narrates the most essential points and resolutely avoids any so-called meaningless empty talk. The chapter headings are, for example: (1) The Purpose of Novels, (2) The Types of Novels, (3) The Style of the Romantic School and the Style of the Realistic School, (4) An Overview of the Development of European and American Novels, (5) An Overview of the Development of Chinese Novels, (6) Novels and Life, (7) Novels and Poetry, (8) Novels and Drama, (9) The Relationship Between Novels and Science, (10) Novels and Writers, (11) On Description, (12) On Structure, (13) On Style, (14) On Appreciation, and Examples of Reference Books, etc. This is indeed a systematic and relatively complete book, and the author's plan for this book is also appropriate. For example, chapters one to eight are specifically about theory, chapters four to five are about history, and chapters eleven to fourteen are about methodology. This kind of organization can be regarded as perfect, because this book is named "Principles of Novels," of course, it should emphasize the theoretical aspects, so this item occupies an important position in this book. As for the historical aspect, creators only need to have a sufficient understanding of it. The so-called method of writing novels is also extremely important, and the author divides it into four chapters to explain, which is truly a perfect aspect of the book's organization and deserves to be praised. Now, for the convenience of readers, the content of each chapter will be briefly analyzed to make its advantages clear.</p>
<p>Chapter One, The Purpose of Novels: The author opens the chapter by stating the meaning, very succinctly, that [the purpose of novels varies according to the different schools. Some say that the purpose of novels is to express the truth of life with imaginative and coherent facts]. Others say that [novels provide a realistic depiction of life]. Nietzsche said in the preface to "Pamira" [If it can comfort the hearts of young men and women and make them happy, and at the same time educate and improve them... If it can teach them religion and morality very easily and happily, so that they can obtain joy and benefit equally... If it can most clearly explain the duties of elders and the obligations of society... If vice makes people disgusted and virtue makes people happy... If it can depict life truthfully and accurately... If it can enthusiastically lead intelligent readers into the story unconsciously in order to achieve the above-mentioned various good purposes...]. Such a collection of citations regarding the purpose of novels is very difficult to obtain. In the end, the author summarizes the main idea of the preface to "Pamira" again, making it clear to readers at a glance. This is truly a scientific research method, that is, to say inductively: (1) to make novels interesting, (2) to make novels contain the meaning of dissolving religious and moral teachings, (3) to make novels accurately depict life. In addition, at the end of this chapter, the author also adds a correct conclusion: "The purpose of novelists is truly difficult to enumerate. From the birth of the novel to the present, the author's purpose can be seen in every book. For example, modern people advocate revolutionary literature or proletarian literature, and their purpose is to use their works as talismans. In addition, there are also some degenerate writers, such as those who write 'black curtain' novels, who also use their works as tools. This kind of thing is certainly not included in the discussion." These words contain supreme truth and at the same time show the author's position and attitude.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, The Types of Novels, refers to three types of novels: long, medium, and short. It makes a detailed discussion of their forms and gives examples of works by famous world writers as evidence, so that one can get a glimpse of their forms.</p>
<p>Chapter Three makes an objective narration of the styles of the romantic and realistic schools, completely from a research perspective. It explains how these two contrasting forms are produced and their expression methods, and also gives examples to prove the main force and rise and fall of each school. Citations are also given for this item in Chinese works, which is a point worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, An Overview of the Development of European and American Novels, starts from ancient times so that we can know the outline of its development. Chapter Five, An Overview of the Development of Chinese Novels, starts from thousands of years ago to the most recent times, especially the description of folk literature, that is, the mother of Chinese novels, which is very detailed. This is truly worthy of our attention and can also be said to be a more important chapter in the whole book. Chapter Six, Novels and Life, describes the close relationship between novels and life in the field of literature, with explanations to make people understand its central position in the field of literature and art. Chapter Seven, Novels and Poetry, first divides the essence of poetry into three types: (1) lyrical, (2) narrative, and (3) dramatic poetry, and then tells us its relationship with novels. Chapter Eight, Novels and Drama, supplements the deficiencies of the previous saying about the connection between poetic drama and it, but this includes theatrical plays. Chapter Nine, The Relationship Between Novels and Science, is an investigation of scientists and artists constantly engaging in human discussions. Chapter Ten, Novels and Writers, is to understand that after art has shouldered a major mission, to study the various issues of novels and writers. Chapter Eleven, On Description: "The novelist's duty is to introduce the characters in the work to the readers, so it is extremely important to describe the personality of the characters." This is very important regarding writing methods and has detailed examples to show the strengths of various works. Chapter Twelve, On Structure: "After the novelist has selected the material, the second step is how to arrange it. How should a novel begin and end, and how should the characters be arranged? These are all structural problems." Finally, the author lists the structure of novels into several types: (1) Classified by form, there are six types: narrative, rosary, retrospective, intricate, and concealed; (3) Classified by content, there are five types: amazing, problem, mystery, emotional, and symbolic. Secondly, the structure of short stories is explained: (1) Beginning A. Starting with dialogue B. Not starting with dialogue (2) Main body (3) Ending, etc. The structure of long novels is said to be from the point of observation (The Point of view) and the emphasis in art (Emphasis in art). Chapter Thirteen, On Style, describes the first-person narration method and the third-person narration method. There is also a brief discussion about the novelist's style. Chapter Fourteen, On Appreciation, refers to the aspect of appreciation of character descriptions, which is also extremely important for general authors. Finally, the examples of reference books are about the principles of novels, the history of novels, and three categories of works, which are very useful for researchers to refer to.</p>
<p>This book is quite detailed and complete. It is a concept for novelists or those who aspire to literature and art regarding the content and form of novels. As Mr. Xie Liuyi said in the preface: "It is very difficult to write novels, and it is not easy to read novels either. Mr. Chen's other book helps others to see how to read novels and how to write novels. I am very willing to introduce it to those who are interested in studying literature and art." I now borrow Mr. Xie's preface as the end of this article, and I also feel that it is extremely appropriate.</p>
