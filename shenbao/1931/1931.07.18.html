<h3>各方面表示</h3>
<p>虞洽卿表示　自各界反日援僑大會實行對日經濟絕交後旅滬日商羣起恐慌日領事日前（十六日）派副領事白井康衆議員加藤鯛一往訪商界領袖反日援僑委員會主席虞洽卿陳述一切謂公使重光已晉京面謁外交部長王正延協商善後總有解决辦法請勿實行經濟絕交虞氏當答此次對日步驟第一步為停止定購日貨第二步抵制日貨第三步實行對日經濟絕交現尙係初步工作如日當局能覺悟圓滿解决則或可商談否則民衆當作第二第三步手續於是乃不得要領而返</p>
<p>工商界表示　本市絲光棉織業同業工會昨開臨時會員大會主席諸文綺報告萬寶山慘案經過全體會員莫不憤慨萬分當議决自動抵制仇貨並將具體方案提交江浙染織業聯會員討論以歸一致又押店業·洗衣業·皮鞋釘楦業·針織業等同業公會及海員分會海軍特別黨部等昨均有通電表示憤慨云</p>
<h3>抵貨聲中航訉</h3>
<p>日貨趕運來申　自朝鮮事起滬各界提議對日經濟絕交已在進行中滬地日人聞訊以定購貨未經運來上海者恐遭阻停自十四日起即急電東洋將購定之大批貨件從速趕裝來滬已經商定日郵社派十一輪運載此外山下·川崎·三井·等亦臨時調大批商輪到神戶橫濱各埠連輸第一批已到上海乘此未曾舉行抵制之前擬再加派輪船助裝昨日日郵社特邀集在滬日商協議提前趕裝之計大批日貨不日陸續抵申再行轉入他埠</p>
<p>商用外輪裝出　本埠匯山大阪浦東等各日商輪船貨棧積儲東貨以白糖海產紙頭布疋等項為最多從十四日起由各日商商得日淸大阪大連及太古怡和等各外輪公司預約定運貨噸位儘一星期內將此項上海棧存之貨裝出以到長江者占十分之七八各外輪一以本國關係（日船）一以營業關係已經允可故近三日洋商江輪出口貨大擠刻正在趕運中</p>
<p>禁阻私運各埠　報關公會得聞日本方面對於貨物運輸已經議定密裝之計其辦法由東洋至滬後即托日人報關行專裝東洋船及英國船出口至長江南北洋對華商輪則概不裝載此舉可避免抵制云云報關公會董事尤森廷為此事昨特往謁虞洽卿商議向江海關請求對於日貨到來密報外輪請實行拒絕報關勿使奸計得售</p>
<p>華輪不裝日貨　不裝日貨尙未正式議定故各華輪公司猶未奉到任何團體通告惟昨日本埠各華輪以良心的驅策對於東洋貨已自動的不代裝載但係非正式的行為也</p>

<h3>領港全體罷工</h3>
<p>外輪阻停吳淞口</p>
<p>如再堅持不復工</p>
<p>海關擬改用華員</p>
<p>外輪領港公會因要求增費為各輪公司所拒絕而實行怠工及至昨日已實行全體罷工由外國來滬之船有到銅沙亮河洞即被阻有抵吳淞而不能進口業已完全阻停昨日自行來滬之船多自行出口不用領港各輪公司昨晨至公會開議討論救濟辦法結果未有解决希望第內容極守秘密經本報記者多方探詢得悉依河泊司主張萬一各領港堅持則輪公司為維持海運計决計改用華人代替茲將所得消息分誌如下</p>
<p>外輪不能進口　查領港線之起始點在吳淞外銅沙之亮河洞距上海約四小時之海程其中難航者不過銅河沙第一段耳領港船係停在該亮河筒而引水來滬者自輪公司不允加費以後各領港從昨日起已全體停止致自歐美各處來華輪船均到銅沙拋停無法開入黃浦法郵船達得那因正班郵輪不能誤期由船主自行開入本日亦不用領港由船主出口其他各船之被阻者貨物均不能到滬起卸守候此事解决</p>
<p>會議未有結果　各輪公司昨日上午九時各派代表至公會內開全體會議討論此事歐美各輪均派人到會協議討論甚久內容不願宣布但聞磋商之下因領港方面不肯讓步故未有結果關於救濟辦法聞已議有一種臨時方案矣</p>
<p>提議改用華員　今次領港罷工</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>自十五日起至今已歷三日而尙無復工希望上海為國際貿易中心地各國商貨旅客每日往來至多如常此堅持則海運交通亦為阻斷江海關河泊司對於此事認為在事實上無增費之理由茍再不復工則為維持上海海道交通計與國際貿易計對於罷工之領港一律停止其職務上的行動由海關改雇揚子領港公</p>
<p>會華員充任（按上海有兩領港公會一為洋商領港公會專領外國來滬船現有三十餘人中國人衹一張君）另有揚子領港公會係華人領港所組織者係帶領各公司之長江船則可免使外輪阻滯淞口昨日各輪公司對此主張已一致表示同情矣按照國府預定辦法上海外人領港權之實行收回業經外部等議定至民國二十二年底為度二十三年元旦起則全國各地領港洋人一律撤退改用華人充任現海軍部已在訓練此項人才矣</p>

<h3>游韓漫談（八）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>華僑在朝鮮半島居住以歷史言由來已久周封箕子於朝鮮漢代設置的樂浪·臨屯·玄菟·眞番四郡便足以證明了以地理言朝鮮仁川與我山東僅一水之隔交通很便所以山東人在韓的較他省更多據最近調查華僑總數將近十萬概分為農·工·商三種職業他們雖是智識較低而勤勞耐苦的美德都超過在日韓人之上但亦因此而每遭日韓人之忌排斥華僑的聲浪有愈唱愈高的趨勢</p>
<p>華僑在韓經商無論為地方行貨之商或城市居貨之賈當其創始時他一部分的財產必保留於商業資本金之外有時遇市場恐慌或意外損失生活上亦不至於驟然發生影響其營業之始往往在陋街僻巷門面狹小而所有交易如麵包·棉布·雜貨·以及食料品等都有閱年未久而堂堂皇皇的中國式商店居然成立這是數見不鮮的事他們商業發展的步驟是由小而大由近而遠在經商的基礎上說確是比日韓商人為穩健否則他們處在萬惡的環境之中怎樣可以維持下去呢</p>
<p>華僑從事於農業的以全韓計算其數當在一萬四千以上多數居於各重要城市的近郊都市中人日常最需要的是蔬菜僑農視其需要而盡量供給又是他們維一的生路近年朝鮮各都市因日本的移民鐵道的添築工商業的發展人口大有集中都市的傾向蔬菜需要與日俱增僑農的生產力也繼長增高他們都是年富力強之輩勞動的精神决非日韓人民所能及他們在野外作業完全日出而作日入而息栽培的蔬菜質量都稱美滿即以漢城·仁川·平壤而言小菜塲上的勢力大部分為僑農所佔據此外他們還利用餘暇從事於飼養豬·羊·雞·鴨的副業可惜他們都沒有受過教育智識淺陋易受人欺尤為日人所仇視</p>
<p>在韓僑工人數在三萬以上類別為筑路工·石工·木工·礦工·雕刻工·搬運工·理髪工·鍛冶工·都有自治團體的組織就是所謂［幫］其組織的主因或為同鄕關係或為同業關係言語習慣智識技能即有不同而其所以能立足於朝鮮者得［幫］之惠實多他們大都奉一人為［頭目］在其指揮之下集合數十百人依一定的秩序而成為某種［幫］的組織凡僑工入［幫］之後不但須聽［頭目］之命且須嚴守幫規亦不能兼營他幫工作頭目可以代表［幫］的全體與企業者或企業者之團體訂結契約使該［幫］常有獨佔勝利之處因其團體訓練所得的結果乃使無人不勤勉無人不努力所以能優越於他人原因即在此僑工因能勤苦能服從以最低的代價得最高的效率所以企業家極重視他們日韓人一部分很妒嫉一部分却要借重成了一種矛盾的現象</p>

<h3>？？？（二五）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>［向左！］</p>
<p>夫人最不喜歡單調見丈夫兀自向右撫着便要下令旋向左去有時要左右相間而行有時要直綫有時要圓圈有時必須橢圓也有時要丈夫口中數着一二三四宛如體操一樣也有時伊竟嫌呼數太簡單要子良唱一曲［可憐的秋香］總之變化無窮須由伊臨時發下命令</p>
<p>忽然肝氣痛的夫人格格格的大笑起來</p>
<p>［肉癢］</p>
<p>伊雙手遮着胸口不許子良再撫了自己兀自笑個不住子良停着手莫名其妙</p>
<p>［不要你動手了！］</p>
<p>［好了沒有？］</p>
<p>子良小心似的問着夫人不語還是亂笑忽然伊坐將起來了</p>
<p>［謝謝你！倒一杯茶給我喝喝！］</p>
<p>［肝氣痛好了麼？］</p>
<p>夫人點點頭子良便到樓下去倒了一杯熱茶捧到床前時見夫人已經又躺下去了</p>
<p>［茶來了起來喝啊！］</p>
<p>［我不要喝！］</p>
<p>子良很覺意外</p>
<p>［又難過起來了麼？］</p>
<p>［不！］</p>
<p>［你不喝茶呌我去倒茶來做什麼？］</p>
<p>夫人忽然又大笑起來了</p>
<p>［這一杯茶是我請你喝的！］</p>
<p>［什麼緣故？］</p>
<p>「方才勞動了你特地請你喝一杯茶」</p>

<h3>蒙古之商業</h3>
<p>— 又忱</p>
<p>自從南京舉行蒙古會議後對於建設三民主義的新蒙古已定出不少具體的議案就中關於交通建設與開發實業更有詳盡的規劃現在特將蒙古的商業現狀作一概括的敘述</p>
<p>蒙古為一高山重疊的高原位於亞洲之腹部面積約等於中國本部十八省但人口密度極為疏落總計也不過三百萬人蒙古天然物產豐富宜於牧畜故人民十九以牧畜為業而以出產各種優良的皮毛馳名於世所產的皮毛大部分運往美國美國亦輸往各種工業製造品如製車糖類皮革等類往蒙古以為交換</p>
<p>辛亥革命後國內紛紛蒙古即乘機宣布獨立建設所謂的［蒙古國民政府］因受了蘇俄的影響决定一切商業須絕對受政府的管理並宣布不加限制所獲利益均歸人民故政府特創立合作購買組織凡屬輸入蒙古境內的商貨若不經過此種組織政府不予保護又凡獨立或私人經營之輸入品必須徴稅其價目亦由合作組織估計之蒙古政府多直接購買貨物或駐庫倫之蒙古合作社總機關經手辦理合作社購買員分駐各國包括莫斯科哈爾濱及天津為三大支部在內蒙古土產品之分銷處則分駐於德國的萊布尼資及美國的紐約二處</p>
<p>查蒙古之貿易孔道有二其一經過南部商業中心之張家口至天津而出海口其二經過蒙古中心之庫倫至蘇俄由西北利亞鐵路至海參崴海口在平時則多由庫倫至貿易中心的滿洲里及海拉爾再經中東鐵路而遠哈爾濱由蒙古到蘇俄多利用汽車駱駝牛車商隊船隻及飛機運輸貨物南部由張家口者則僅用汽車北路可以免稅且運輸費亦較南路為輕沿途亦較南路為平穩因南路除多過厘稅外沿途萑苻不靖匪類甚多當貨物運到張家口再用火車運到天津因額外徴稅及道途不安全關係商人雖將貨價提高仍無利益北路運輸夏季多由汽車或水道冬季則用駱駝至於飛機客運每兩星期一回經年不停</p>
<p>當一九二九年秋季中俄戰爭發生時中東路因軍事關係蒙古在滿洲里及海拉爾之皮毛商業極受損失南部運輸乃得乘機暢旺張家口亦恢復了皮毛中心地位張家口原來是蒙古內外的商業重要市塲自蒙古政府設立中央購置機關以後又因苛捐雜稅及保護費之繁重南路商業以致一蹶不振而移至北路轉入蘇俄的勢力範圍中去了</p>
<p>蒙古由庫倫運到海參崴的貨物當以皮毛為大宗此項皮毛之銷路以美國為最多同時蒙古之入口貨物則以俄國之汽油及油類歐洲之雜貨德國之機械為大宗美國輸往蒙古之貨物最近雖有一部分由滿洲里海拉爾入蒙但大宗還是取道張家口</p>
<p>美國運往蒙古之工業品以運貨汽車及半噸至一噸半之私用汽車為主無論車身大小運貨或載客均極擁擠汽車到蒙後車身多半改造以便運貨一輛足容乘客七人之汽車往往坐至二十五人且加上行李等物作數星期長途的旅行此外美國又運往鑛料糖菓麥粉及皮革入蒙據一九六年之統計由天津運至庫倫之加省產糖有五百箱之多由哈爾濱運入者為數亦衆皮革類則屬原料在哈爾濱製成靴鞋再輸入蒙古銷塲極大</p>
<p>由以上看來蒙古實是絕好的天產之地可惜與中國本部交通阻梗使商業不能振興尤其是蘇俄煽動蒙古政府的關係政府管理商業的不成熟思想乃為蒙古商業的隱憂因為交通不便的緣故中國本部的國貨不能運往供給其需要致滿蒙古又為帝國主義過剩工業品的宣戰尾閭這是極待挽救的</p>

<h3>雷</h3>
<p>— 語溪</p>
<p>星期六晚人都回去了留在宿舍裏的老是我們幾個不大到外面去的人我們買了兩瓶酒添了幾個菜還買了幾多牛肉在那晒台上吃乘凉夜飯</p>
<p>天是給烏雲遮住電光從大地面四週閃亮遠處的雷聲亦可隱約聞得大概暴雨快來了我們還到室內吃飯</p>
<p>果不出我們所料雨來了雨勢很大打着屋打着洋台打着樹葉巨大的聲音有如大匹瀑布從山頂瀉下而且還有雷助威即雷起初是在遠處的如今是在我們近旁了而且很低像就在我們屋頂旋繞着不過夏天大雷雨是常事我們除了感嘆今年雨水多之外是並不介意到什麼的直等到一聲霹靂把所有電燈都震熄了的時候我們才陷入於恐怖之境</p>
<p>那時室內統黑了而外面的電光幾乎不稍間斷地從窗爿裏射進來照得室內同白晝一樣亮照見桌上的酒杯和碗碟照見床上的被頭和蒲扇照得書架上的洋裝書還照到我們立着的幾個人和嚇得怔呆了的面孔望望窗外外面是雷雨的世界火蛇千條在我們附近的天空中旋繞雷是永遠在我們四週奔馳不去像是釘住我們這幢房子非把它打掉不可的樣子</p>
<p>各人像在火綫上看見那些砲彈將從上面落下來一樣紛紛謀自己躲避之方有的往被裏鑽也有綣伏在床角裏明知那雷不會如此凑巧落到我們房子上但是看了那電光聽了那聲音便也無法抑止自己懼怕的心理…</p>
<p>「哈哈觸了電全房子毀掉那時住在裏面的我們幾個人就是鑽進板縫裏也不能逃出那被毀滅的運命除非逃出那宿舍誰要活命逃吧」</p>
<p>「逃去送死外面是這麼大的雨淋着雨身上着了濕是最容易給雷打…」</p>
<p>靜默了一回老陳急促地說</p>
<p>「謝謝誰快去把窗關上玻璃可以隔絕電」這個任務除了老靳是誰也不願擔負的他在關窗的時候還探首外望口裏說「那美麗的火蛇就在我們屋薝口飛躍」</p>
<p>「誰坐在鐵床上的坐到樓板上去吧鐵床是很容易傳電的」其實老徐說這話已含有開玩笑的意味了可是那據說槍珠砲彈已經看慣了的老葛竟上了他的當引得我們大家笑</p>
<p>漸漸地由一個嚴重時期進入一個嬉笑的時期了</p>
<p>「我們禱告上帝吧呌他把我們施救」</p>
<p>「天呀我沒有打過爺娘」</p>
<p>「我沒有欺負過人天生眼睛」</p>
<p>「我忠於職務」</p>
<p>「啊啊我從不曾將飯米碎丟入尿坑之中」…</p>
<p>各人禱告　老靳却在黑暗中呷酒吃菜那時桌上還剩有不少酒菜呢假如給他一個人偷偷摸摸吃完了我們不是太吃虧了嗎於是我喊</p>
<p>「誰這時候還在那裏喝酒大膽大膽酒是最容易傳電的」大家笑老靳有點難為情也想出對付我們的話來了</p>
<p>「這時大家不能笑雷公要打死那些歡喜笑的人」於是你一聲我一句大家嘻嘻哈哈講些俏皮話適才的恐怖像已忘記了</p>
<p>慢慢地那雷雨的聲勢减小一點電燈也重放光明了</p>
<p>我們好似從危險的時期進入安全的時期了心頭一安閒便會想到吃看看桌上那剛才吃剩的小半瓶酒僅存一點點了剛才還記得剩有三包牛肉在桌上的如今一塊也沒有了酒是老靳吃光的無疑幾包牛肉據偵查結果說是老葛躲在被裏吃掉的</p>
<h3>苦惱</h3>
<p>— 德人</p>
<p>「民有這樣好的英文和國文將來畢了業一定有很好的地位給他）」壹先生正經的說著望著講臺下許多正聽得起勁的學生的臉</p>
<p>下課鍾響動後壹先生出了教室於是同學們都聚起來討論畢業後應該找甚麼做</p>
<p>時光很快的一班的同學都徼幸的畢業了到現在已有三四星期多了在這三四星期中畢業生當然少不了要東奔西走的找尋解决麵包問題的處所的但是很可憐的畢業生是一年年一大批一大批的出來給他們作事的地方可沒有一大批一大批的增加出來畢業生找不著噉飲地沒法想祇得都回到母校要求學校當局想想法子</p>
<p>但是也很可憐的這學校當局把自己的解决麵包問題的處所勉强的把住了已非易事那裏還有空閒的時間來管你們畢業生的解决麵包問題的處所呢因為現在眞似交了麵包問題恐慌時期一出了學校就急急地謀食的人實在太多了</p>
<p>經了同學們再三的請求學校當局就不得已的發了一點慈悲心於是正式的在許多畢業生中仔細的選了三數個比較漂亮些的活動些的留在校裏辦事一方面他們算是答應了你們的請求一方面他們自己也得到了便宜因為他們可以拿菲薄的薪資去雇用他們反正是他們自願的求上來的而且他們是方畢業的經騐不足的葳小的謀食者</p>
<p>有幾個記性牢些的學生見民沒有選在校中辦事就把壹先生所說的「民有這樣好的英文和國文將來畢了業定有很好的地位給他」的一句話捉住了去問壹先生壹先生仁容的把回話支開去了其實這問壹先生的同學眞太不懂事了他竟會粗得不明白壹先生說這句話的本意如他細細的一想立刻可以明白壹先生所說的話意思是在使學生勤懇的求學而不在他自己負說這句話的責任的</p>
<p>結果學校裏仍用了那漂亮而活動的幾個其他的學生功課雖好雖壹先生曾說過的那一位「有很好的地位給他」的學生也仍沒有中選他們退出了學校祇得沒精打彩的悶坐在家中苦苦的怨恨著在社會上求噉飯地的為難</p>

<p>To be handled in the capital if necessary</p>
<p>Nanjing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to first have Zhong Yu, the negotiation officer in Binjiang, negotiate with Ishisa, the Japanese Consul in Changchun, regarding the Wanbaoshan Incident, and report the progress at any time. If necessary, it can also be handled in the capital. However, for the convenience of document files, local negotiations will be conducted first. The Governor of Jilin Province has telegraphed for several days, stating that no new facts have occurred in various places. (Special telegram on the 17th)</p>
<p>Harbin. Before noon on the 15th, the Japanese Consul General stationed in Liaoning, Hayashi, visited Zhang Zuoxiang and made four demands regarding the Wanbaoshan Incident: (1) Preserve the validity of the Wanbaoshan paddy field contract and allow Koreans to grow rice in the coming year. The Chinese side shall not damage any ditch or embankment construction for rice cultivation. (2) Compensate for the losses of Koreans in the Wanbaoshan Incident. (3) The Chinese side shall allow Koreans to reside freely in the Northeast in the future. (4) Guarantee the lives and property of Koreans in Wanbaoshan. The talks lasted two hours without result. However, Zhang Zuoxiang agreed to talk again after Zhong Yu's arrival. Zhang wanted to negotiate the Wanbaoshan Incident locally in the Northeast and not mix it with the Korean border massacre for negotiations. Various groups in Harbin have decided to raise 12,000 yuan to send two specialists to Korea to express condolences. (Special telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>Harbin. Koreans in Harbin have issued a letter to Chinese compatriots stating that the Wanbaoshan Incident and the Korean incidents were not the intention of all Koreans. True Koreans feel apologetic. (Special telegram on the 17th)</p>

<p>Harbin. The number of Japanese police in Mashankou has been reduced to twenty-three. However, the withdrawal all took place at night to prevent people from seeing them, and they deliberately created confusion by setting up more than twenty tents in Mashankou, with Japanese flags planted on them. Chinese people are not allowed to enter within three miles, while Koreans steal cattle and dogs from farmers to be cooked and eaten by the Japanese police. The Japanese side is offering a reward of 500 yuan for the arrest of Sun Rongqing and other representatives of the Wanbaoshan farmers. Sun and others have gone into hiding.

Li Zhonggang has a firsthand account of the Pyongyang massacre, with every word filled with tears, making it unbearable to read. Most surprisingly, the buildings of our overseas Chinese in Korea, adjacent to the Japanese police station, were all burned down, with none remaining. The Japanese police turned a blind eye.

<h3>Korean Consulate</h3>
<p>The Course of Negotiations with Japan</p>
<p>Nanjing. News from diplomatic circles regarding the Korean incidents: According to the report received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Seoul, the Consul General's Office requested the Japanese authorities to take preventive measures before the anti-Chinese incidents occurred. On the 4th, it also sent a letter to the Korean Director-General of Political Affairs, stating that it had requested prevention before the riots, but unfortunate incidents occurred one after another, indicating obvious ineffective protection. It should request the dispatch of military police to suppress and control the situation, and notify the custody of the property of overseas Chinese in distress. The loss procedures will be handled after verification. Since the issuance of this letter, the Japanese side has still not taken effective measures to stop the riots, and the losses of the overseas Chinese have become even greater. The Consul General's Office sent another letter to the local authorities on the 9th, stating that the Korean riots, the massacre of overseas Chinese, and the plundering of property should be the full responsibility of the Japanese side and suggesting emergency measures. This clearly shows that our side had warned the Japanese side in advance to take precautions, but the Japanese side did not take effective measures to stop the riots, resulting in the outbreak of uncontrollable riots. This matter is purely due to the ineffective protection of the Japanese side, and the responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side. (Special telegram on the 17th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Research on the Northeast (3)</h3>
<p>Mr. Cai Yuanpei once said, "Recently, it was rumored that General A asked General B, 'How many soldiers do you have?' General B replied, 'I don't know.' He also asked, 'How much money do you have?' General B also said, 'I don't know...'" This is naturally a joke, but General B can almost be a representative of our compatriots across the country. If someone were to ask the patriots in the country who stomp their feet and talk eloquently about national affairs, "What is the significance of the products of the Northeast, the Korean overseas Chinese in the Northeast, and the Northeast border?" I am afraid that ten out of ten would answer, "I don't know." Or, if someone were to ask the scholars in the country who argue eloquently and write thousands of words, "What is the historical background, geographical features, and economic status of the Northeast?" I am afraid that nine out of ten would stare blankly and be unable to answer. As for asking about the types of soybeans in the Northeast, the categories of animal husbandry, the driving of cattle and sheep herds, and the cultivation of sorghum, the listeners would cover their ears and run away, regarding them as vulgar and lowly people, or angrily answer with Confucius' words to Fan Chi, "I am not as good as an old farmer, I am not as good as an old gardener." The things I despise and do not talk about, the Japanese study diligently day and night, devoting themselves to researching the history, geography, customs, products, and customs of the Northeast. Not to mention various agricultural products, the types of planting, the ones with large quantities, the ones with good quality, the ones with white eyebrows and black navels in soybeans, the ones with Daimyo pigs, Niname pigs, and pouch pigs in pigs, as well as the commands for driving mules and horses, [ChaCha] (forward), [Chao Chao] (backward), [VoVo] (right), and the commands for driving cattle, [Ha Ha] (forward), [Vo Vo] (stop), all have precise investigations and detailed records, and they are used to declare to their people, so that their people can also study them. They never regard them as minor skills, but as economics and learning related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Our people often boast of a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population. Now, let's put aside the statistics of the whole country and ask about the local Northeast. No one dares to answer how vast the territory is, how abundant the resources are, or how large the population is. They know nothing about what they should know, and they are unwilling to do anything they should do, watching Japan and Russia act as surrogates and even seize it for themselves. How can we not be ashamed of ourselves for boasting about this? The Shanghai Tongwen College held a 30th-anniversary celebration the year before last and printed a commemorative album. At the beginning of the album was a map of China, with red lines drawn densely and horizontally like a spider web. My entire territory was in its net. These red lines represent the footprints of the students of the college who traveled to my remote and poor rural areas during the summer and winter vacations to conduct investigations. After the investigation, there were detailed reports. This kind of spirit, this kind of intention, is not only terrifying but also admirable. Domestic students often travel during holidays, but the destinations are nothing more than West Lake, Lushan, Qingdao, and Beidaihe. The purpose of travel is nothing more than seeking pleasure and comfort, or seeking to broaden their personal horizons. As for studying geography, investigating products, and visiting customs, they are not only unwilling but also disdainful. Comparing the two, how can we not be ashamed and ashamed? The Japanese have already made a detailed analysis of my Northeast. Tanaka Giichi said clearly in his active policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia: "If we want to conquer the world in the future, we must conquer China. If we want to conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia... so that the world knows that East Asia is our</p>
<p>East Asia and will never dare to invade us. This is the legacy of Emperor Meiji, and it is also a necessary thing for the survival of my Japanese Empire." After reading these words, let us close our eyes and think, "They know me clearly. Will they begin to realize the legacy of their Emperor Meiji and start doing what is necessary for the survival of their country?" Also, think about whether the desires of the Japanese can be filled after reaching a certain part of the goal, that is, they will stop their invading iron hooves. These questions are closely related to the interests of my people and cannot be ignored. Taking advantage of this time when we are still allowed, let us quickly study, quickly save ourselves. Only if the people of the country have full determination and perseverance and strive to work hard, who would dare to sleep soundly beside my bed? The white mountains and black waters are my magnificent rivers and mountains. The rich land and abundant resources are my golden treasure trove. Otherwise, if people's index fingers have already moved, I will be the fish and meat on the chopping block. The future of the Northeast is unimaginable. The reporter's words of blood and tears are exhausted here. Finally, I sincerely hope that my people will quickly study the Northeast, develop the Northeast, and save the Northeast.</p>

<h3>French Proposal</h3>
<p>Financial Aid to Germany</p>
<p>Plan to Lend Germany 100 Million Pounds</p>
<p>With Customs Revenue as Collateral</p>
<p>Important European and American Figures Gather in Paris</p>
<p>Before the London Executive Conference</p>
<p>A Preliminary Meeting Will Be Held First</p>
<p>Communist Riot in the Ruhr</p>
<p>Police Armed Suppression</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 16th: It is heard that French Prime Minister Laval will propose to jointly lend 100 million pounds to Germany with Britain and the United States, with German customs as collateral. France does not require political guarantees, but Germany's military expenditures must not exceed the amount already stipulated in the budget. As for the Austro-German customs union, it is not conditional. France can undertake the largest portion of the loan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 17th: It is heard that the details of the loan plan to Germany also include the following three points: (1) Germany agrees to pay the indemnity under the Young Plan when the Hoover moratorium plan expires; (2) The powers guaranteeing the 100 million pound loan for ten years have the right to establish a guarantee committee similar to the organization under the Dawes Plan; (3) Germany's foreign borrowing thereafter shall be subject to supervision.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th: President Hoover has instructed Secretary of State Stimson to go to London from Europe to attend the Executive Conference on July 20. President Hoover also instructed Treasury Secretary Mellon to attend the meeting at that time. According to President Hoover himself, he instructed Mellon to attend the meeting so that the US government can benefit from his contribution of opinions. The US President also stated that the London conference is purely limited to considering current urgent issues.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 17th: It is heard that newspapers commented on the importance of the United States participating in the London Conference, saying that the Americans will take strong measures this time, and it is expected that this meeting will lay the foundation for the disarmament conference in advance. At that time, Britain, the United States, and Italy will jointly advocate for a substantial reduction in armaments.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: The names of the representatives of various countries attending the London conference on Sunday have not yet been fully known. It is expected that German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius will be among the German representatives. The French representatives will probably be Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Briand, and Finance Minister Flandin. The British representatives will be Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Minister Henderson, and Finance Minister Snowden. According to Berlin news, after the London Executive Conference makes a decision, the German people are now feeling the stability of the people's hearts. Banks that had been closed for two days reopened today, and the foreign exchange market also showed a stable trend, with the mark rising slightly.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 17th: German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius are preparing to depart this evening for Paris to have a public negotiation with French Prime Minister Laval, French Foreign Minister Briand, British Foreign Minister Henderson, and US Secretary of State Stimson, before attending the conference of countries related to reparations in London. The German people welcome this news because the situation may take a turn for the better and the economic crisis may be resolved early. The Berliner Tageblatt and most other newspapers attribute the French invitation to the mediation of British Foreign Minister Henderson. However, conservative and extremist newspapers are surprised by the sudden change and are unwilling for Brüning to accept the invitation from the French government, considering this an insult to Germany, and that future insults will continue to arise due to Germany's tolerance. The Local Guidance Newspaper even stated that it would be better for the Prime Minister to resign than to go to Paris, and a certain newspaper of the National Socialist Party in Berlin denounced Brüning's trip to Paris as a harbinger of treason and predicted that when Brüning and Curtius return to the country in the future, they may be despised by the whole country. However, the Germania Newspaper, which has a close relationship with the Prime Minister, expressed welcome to the French invitation and declared that Brüning will take national interests as a prerequisite no matter where he goes and will not be held hostage by others. Reuters, Washington, 16th: The Federal Reserve Bank issued an article showing the severity of the German panic, saying that the United States' cash imports in June totaled about 156 million yuan, which is a rare record. Most of it came from Germany. When the German people were shaken, Americans who had short-term loans deposited in Germany withdrew them, so cash poured in. As of July 16, gold deposits here reached a new record of 4,965,000,000 yuan, compared with 4,548,000,000 yuan at the same time last year. It was reported that Germany intends to suspend the foreign bonds issued before the fundraising of the bonds. According to New York news, the German Minister of Finance has stated to American banker Lee that the interest on Germany's long-term bonds and the reserve fund will of course be paid. German bonds on Wall Street have become firmer, but the value of the mark has not improved. The pound sterling rose more than yesterday, and the French franc fell more than the pound sterling. Paris news said that the plan to lend Germany 100 million pounds with tax revenue as collateral has been submitted to the cabinet today. The closing exchange rate soared.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Essen, 17th: On Thursday night, a major riot broke out in Kierspe, the center of the Ruhr industrial area. Communist Party members attacked a corner of the city, first destroying the street lights, then digging up street stones to build fortifications, and took advantage of the darkness to loot twenty large food stores. The police went to suppress them, and the rioters resisted by opening fire. The authorities had no choice but to send armored vehicles with machine guns to drive them away separately, but the rioters still lurked on the roofs or high-rise buildings and sniped in between. The gunfire only stopped until dawn when they fled and hid. A large number of police were then dispatched to surround the area and search for the rioters and arrested many. Since then, the authorities have been able to completely control the situation and are now on strict alert to prevent disturbances from happening again in neighboring towns.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Encourages People to Use Domestic Products</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Bombay, 17th: Gandhi published an article in Young India saying that the expulsion of British piece goods from the Indian market was not due to the Indian people's boycott of British goods, but to Japanese competition. Therefore, if Indian textile factories cannot catch up quickly, even if the Indian Congress strives to encourage the people to use domestic goods, the Indian cotton textile market will eventually be dominated by the Japanese.</p>

<h3>A Retrospect and Prospect of the Pacific International Academic Society (6) (Continued) - Bin</h3>
<p>Although there is no absolute advantage or disadvantage in all international organizations, it depends on the efforts of the people of each country and the participating representatives. Our country has not gained any practical benefits from joining the League of Nations, but we should not give up eating because of choking because it is useless to us and then declare withdrawal. The success or failure of diplomacy does not lie in empty arguments, nor in the sympathy of a few people abroad, nor in whether to participate in international organizations, but entirely in the actual efforts of the country. Moreover, the Pacific International Academic Society cannot have any resolutions, let alone the power to execute them. Its ability to resolve international disputes is only to make suggestions. If our people regard the society as a tool for international liaison, it can be regarded as a living Buddha who helps the poor and relieves the needy, but it cannot be hoped for too much, otherwise the more hope there is, the greater the disappointment will be. If our people and our representatives can take a dim view of it, they can regard the society as an academic group, or they can regard the representatives of various countries attending our country this time as a travel experience, or they can vigorously oppose it, which seems unnecessary. Moreover, the venue of this meeting was decided at the Xijing meeting two years ago. Our representatives should have recognized the Chinese Pacific International Academic Society and formally notified various countries, making it difficult to stop. If we go back on our word temporarily, it will be more deeply related to our national dignity, which is what we cannot but carefully consider. Although the so-called taking a dim view is by no means perfunctory and sloppy, we should not have any extravagant hopes for the society, but we still cannot relax in the slightest for this conference. We should clearly understand the situation of the first, second, and third conferences and learn from the lessons of the past. On the one hand, we should have a detailed setup of the venue to fulfill our duty as the host and sincerely treat the guests with affection, which is enough to show our respect for the representatives of various countries. On the other hand, our people should fully express their legitimate demands for the society before the meeting and should awaken the attention of compatriots throughout the country and oppressed ethnic groups along the Pacific coast to jointly supervise the society and put it on the right track. As for our country's attending representatives, their responsibility is even more important. Before the meeting, they should have sufficient research on various topics. During the discussion, they should make detailed and practical expositions and serious protests on all facts that violate justice and public reason in the Pacific International and all the pain suffered by China under the shackles of unequal treaties so that the representatives of various countries can have a full understanding. On this point, the author has earnestly expressed his wishes in the above article, and here I respectfully express my hope again. Moreover, if the representatives of various countries in this conference can all act as scholars, based on the position of public reason and justice, and conduct a purely objective study of various issues, and promote and supervise their governments to change their policies of foreign aggression and liberate the shackles of weaker ethnic groups to permanently consolidate world peace, then not only will our country be deeply blessed, but also the future of human culture will be realized. That is also the starting point of the society's purpose and the earnest hope of our people.</p>
<p>This article has detailed the current situation of the Pacific and the past of the Pacific International Academic Society. Finally, I respectfully quote Mr. Sun Yat-sen's last words on the Pacific issue to warn the people of the country and to conclude this article.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "In the past, the Mediterranean issue and the Atlantic issue, I can ignore them. However, the Pacific issue from now on is really related to the survival of our Chinese nation and the destiny of the Chinese country. The center of gravity of the Pacific is China. To fight for the sea power of the Pacific is to fight for the right of the Chinese gateway. Whoever holds this gateway has this hall, this treasure. People are fighting for me, how can I ignore it?" May the people and representatives of our country savor this teaching carefully. (End)</p>

<h3>Suppression of Communist Troops and Capture of Guangchang</h3>
<p>Liu Ruiheng Arrives in Jiangxi to Inspect the Military Medical Situation</p>
<p>Luo's Division Establishes Contact with Ma's Brigade in Ganzhou</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Guangchang is located south of Nanfeng, east of Ningdu, and north of Shicheng, bordering Jianning and Ninghua in Fujian. It is an important place for Jiangnan to connect with Fujian. A few days ago, after the suppression of communist troops captured Lichuan, the eastern Jiangxi communist bandits, except for a part that fled to Fujian, mostly retreated to Guangchang, planning to unite with the western Fujian communist bandits. Then the suppressing communist troops bravely advanced and captured the important passes of Kangdu, Qianshan, and Kuzhu on the 11th, and immediately took the Guangchang city with a left and right encirclement formation. At noon on the 12th, our troops had occupied Datangxu and Shunhua Wu on the opposite bank of Guangcheng and fiercely fired at the bandits in the city. Another part of our troops attacked Xinpo to cut off the communist bandits' westward retreat, and another part circled around Guangchang to the south for dozens of miles to Baishui Town to cut off the connection between the Guangchang communist bandits and the Shicheng communist bandits. Until today, the aircraft reported that the suppressing communist troops had already captured Guangchang.</p>
<p>In recent days, the battles in Guangchang, Ningdu, Donggu, and other places have been extremely fierce. All the rear military doctors have set off to the front line to rescue the wounded soldiers. Liu Hengrui, the Director-General of Military Medical Services, came to Jiangxi from Beijing to inspect the military medical situation. On the 12th, he arrived in the province and convened a meeting of military medical cadres at the Maternity and Child Hospital on the 14th. Jiang Kezong, the Director of the Military Medical Department, Liu Dalian, the Director of the Military Station Health Department, the directors of the military medical departments in the province, the directors of the rear hospitals, the directors of the field hospitals, and many foreign consultants attended the meeting and resolved many issues such as battlefield rescue, military hygiene, and surgical treatment of wounded soldiers. As for the surgical teams and military doctors dispatched by the headquarters from Beijing to Jiangxi, they have all been transferred to the front line to work. The General Headquarters received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief He yesterday saying that thousands of guerrillas and prisoners will be escorted to Nanchang in the next few days and handed over to the Road Bureau and the Transportation Department to be compiled into labor teams to engage in road construction under strict supervision, and personnel will be sent from the Training Department of the General Headquarters to train them. The right-wing force of the suppressing communist troops is also progressing rapidly. After Luo Lin's division captured Suichuan, the bandits of Hu, Luo, Zeng, and Liu fled in all directions. Luo's division beheaded and captured many scattered bandits and established contact with Ma's brigade in Ganzhou. Li Mingrui's troops fled to southern Jiangxi. The fellow villagers of the Jiangnan brigade specially elected Chen Panzao to go to Ji'an to petition Commander-in-Chief Chen to send troops to suppress them. However, the Chen's troops originally assigned to attack the front of Donggu have arrived near Donggu, so the Ganzhou communist bandits specially assigned Ma's brigade to be responsible for the suppression (July 16).</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation of Overseas Chinese in Wonsan During the Korean Riot</h3>
<p>Eleven Died and Eighteen Seriously Injured</p>
<p>More Than Two Thousand People Sought Refuge at the Consulate</p>
<p>Also Affected Areas Include Kangwon, Tongchon, and Other Places</p>
<p>Wonsan, Korea Correspondence: Japanese imperialists secretly instigated the Korean people to launch an anti-Chinese movement as a backing for the Wanbaoshan Incident. Therefore, all of Korea, except for the areas bordering China, was affected. Riots began in Wonsan on the evening of the 4th, attacking more than ten stores such as the Yuchenxiang store in Shangdong. It became more intense on the 5th. At 2 pm, Vice Consul Hu and Mr. Xu went to Ge Ma to rescue farmers and workers.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>All places gathered hundreds of Koreans preparing to seek revenge on the Chinese. Therefore, this trip of Hu and others was very dangerous. After 6 pm, the rioters in various places became more numerous, gathering about thousands of people, beating overseas Chinese and attacking stores everywhere. Dozens of stores were destroyed one after another. Eleven farmers and workers were beaten to death, two of whom have been buried. The remaining corpses were either privately buried or thrown into the river and their whereabouts are still unknown. Eighteen people were seriously injured and have been treated by doctors hired by the Chamber of Commerce. The number of minor injuries is countless. In addition, there are still many people whose life or death is unknown. The police only superficially perfunctorily and failed to stop the chaos, causing the whole city to fall into great chaos. Overseas Chinese fled to the consulate. On the 5th, 6th, and 7th, a total of 1198 men and 287 women were received. On the 8th, 604 men and 7 women were received. On the 9th, 12 men were received. In total, 2108 people were counted. Together with the original residents of Chinatown, there were a total of 2555 people, who were living in the Chinese Association Hall, the Party Headquarters, the Overseas Chinese School, the Chengji warehouse, the homes of the overseas Chinese in Chinatown, and the empty houses of the battalion. The Chamber of Commerce temporarily took on the responsibility of providing food and drink. After the 7th, the Koreans had slightly realized and stopped the riots, but the Japanese still did not allow the Chinese to leave Chinatown. It was not until the morning of the 10th that the local refugees were allowed to return to work first. It is heard that the Wonsan Consulate plans to first request the police station to provide a safety guarantee before allowing the refugees to resume their business. Negotiations are still underway. The overseas Chinese in Changjeon Port, Kangwon Province, were also expelled on the 6th. Four died and seven were seriously injured when they arrived in Wonsan on the 7th. After being beaten and injured, these seven people were buried in the ditch by the Koreans. Fortunately, they were discovered by the store clerk and rescued. They are now being treated in Wonsan and their lives are still in danger. Two Chinese workers were also beaten to death in Paechon-ri, Tongchon County, and the eyeballs of two others were taken out and thrown on the riverbank. Extremely large riots also occurred in other places such as Seopo, Naeho, Hamheung, and Sinpo. The losses of overseas Chinese are incalculable. The Consulate is currently conducting an investigation.</p>
<p>The Japanese side originally wanted to take the opportunity to expel the Chinese workers. At 7 pm on the 8th, the Tongchon Police Station had expelled 555 Chinese railway workers in the county to Wonsan. Others were being sent along the way. The Wonsan Consulate immediately telegraphed the Consul-General to protest to the Governor-General's Office. The Governor-General's Office had no excuse and had to order all places to prohibit expulsion. As a result, more than 300 people who were being sent halfway were left in Tongchon and stopped moving forward (July 10).</p>
<h3>The Wanbaoshan Incident</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese Negotiation Documents (4)</p>
<p>Letter from Japanese Consul to Municipal Office:</p>
<p>Regarding the Three-Family Fort Farm issue, we have met numerous times, but there has been no sign of a satisfactory resolution, which I deeply regret. The normally harmonious relationship between the Chinese and Japanese in the local area has been overshadowed by dark clouds since the incident occurred, which is truly concerning. I am constantly anxious about finding a satisfactory compromise. In our previous meeting, the main obstacle to the case was the opposition of the local people. I earnestly requested that your Director use his best efforts to persuade them to desist. I have now received your letter No. 161 of the 14th of this month, and I am aware that you have summoned representatives of the local people to persuade them to desist, but without success. However, if they were informed of the facts and earnestly persuaded, they might be dissuaded. Furthermore, regarding the paddy field project, we will instruct the Koreans to make every effort to avoid anything that is detrimental or inconvenient to the local people, regardless of whether the unexpected damages claimed by the farmers are factual. In short, the implementation of this paddy field project will be a trial run to observe the results before making further plans. I hope you will give it favorable consideration. Furthermore, regarding the dispatch of twelve policemen and the start of construction by Korean farmers mentioned at the end of your letter No. 161 of the 14th of this month, during our previous meeting, I expressed concern that the Korean farmers, being eager to start sowing, might begin construction of the weir without waiting for instructions, thus causing undesirable conflicts with the opposing Chinese farmers. Therefore, on the 12th, I dispatched four plainclothes policemen to the site to specifically restrain the Koreans from acting rashly. This was fully understood by your Director. In other words, the sole purpose of our police dispatch was to restrain the Korean farmers and prevent conflicts with your country's farmers. As for the Korean farmers starting construction, we have not yet received a report of that happening. It may be that the Korean farmers were transporting willow branches, which was mistaken for the start of work. This is merely a preparatory action, as they are currently collecting materials to be used for weir construction after a satisfactory resolution is reached. Please do not misunderstand. Furthermore, if this case is allowed to drag on, it is difficult to guarantee that incidents will not occur, which is not what I desire. We have repeatedly negotiated with you, but you insist on your original position regarding our efforts to reach a satisfactory settlement. Therefore, your side is responsible for any undesirable situation that may arise. I am writing to inform you accordingly.</p>
<p>To: Director Zhou of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office</p>
<p>Tashiro Shigetoku, Consul Resident in Changchun</p>
<p>June 16th</p>
<p>Letter from Municipal Office to Japanese Consul:</p>
<p>Upon opening, I have read with respect your Official Document No. 44 of June 16th. The fact that the Korean people of Wanbaoshan forcibly excavated land and dug waterways, intending to build dams across rivers and divert the Itong River, has been determined through joint investigation to be a purely illegal act that violates current laws and lacks a consensual agreement. This infringes upon the legitimate and inherent rights of landowners and farmers. The impact directly and significantly damages the livelihoods of thousands of farmers. The facts are clearly stated in our Official Documents No. 158 of June 11th and No. 161 of June 14th. Any human being with blood and understanding, regardless of nationality, could easily discern the right and wrong with a few words, even the most foolish and ignorant. Based on the results of the joint investigation, the plan to build dams and divert river water is undoubtedly out of the question, and there is no room for further discussion. At this time, the remaining issues to be resolved are only the question of the Korean people's departure and the compensation for damages among the parties involved. The final solution has already been described in our Official Document No. 159 of June 12th. I hope you will carefully consider the options and provide a clear response so that we can conclude this matter as soon as possible. As for the Korean people temporarily staying here, it is certainly acceptable that your side recently dispatched police to convey the intention to stop work. However, now that the intention has been conveyed, you should immediately order them to return. Since we are responsible for protection, we can naturally monitor the cessation of work. There is no need for your side to take superfluous action. Furthermore, we have repeatedly received reports from Changchun County that the Korean people are currently weaving baskets and rolling up blinds with willow branches in preparation for building dams and waterways. Moreover, your police officers seem to be maintaining and promoting this work, which is contrary to the resolution agreed upon by both parties on the 8th of this month. I hope you will investigate this matter, immediately withdraw the personnel, and stop the work in order to avoid further complications. This would be most appreciated.</p>

<h3>Refugees from Korea Arrive in Qingdao</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Arranges for Their Return to Their Native Places</p>
<p>Refugees Describe the Cruelty of the Koreans</p>
<p>Korean Riot Was Indeed Instigated by the Japanese</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: The Korean massacre of our Chinese residents has aroused national indignation. The Navy recently dispatched the Zhenhai warship to Incheon and other places to escort the refugees back to China. It is reported that several groups of these refugees have returned by ship. About three thousand people disembarked in Yantai. The Qingdao Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Yantai Chamber of Commerce on the 14th, stating: "Today, over five hundred refugees returning from Korea will board the Kyodo Maru to Qingdao. We fear that the Qingdao Customs may create difficulties. Please kindly intercede for their release." Another telegram stated: "The previous telegram mentioned that the refugees going to Qingdao need to be transferred to their original residences. We beg you to take care of the transfer and send them off." After receiving the telegrams, the Qingdao Chamber of Commerce immediately notified the Customs Office. Today (the 15th) at noon, the ship finally entered the port. Song Yuting, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Yu Weiting, Standing Committee Member, personally went to the pier to provide assistance. Dong Zhidao, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, Ren Dongying, Chief of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and the Surveillance Section Chief of the Port Authority also arrived to help. The refugees, including men, women, the elderly, and children, numbered about eight hundred. Due to the lack of suitable accommodation, they were temporarily housed in the pier warehouses. The Chamber of Commerce has ordered four hundred catties of steamed buns to feed the refugees. It has also been found that most of these refugees are from Rizhao and Juxian Counties. Therefore, the Qingdao Shipping Association has specially prepared two small steamers, Qingxing and Yusheng, to transport a batch of them to Shijiu, where they will disembark. They are scheduled to depart tonight at six o'clock. The Social Affairs Bureau has notified the Public Security Bureau of Shijiu to send personnel to provide assistance at that time. As for those staying in Qingdao, the Chamber of Commerce has discussed with the Inn Association and arranged for them to be temporarily accommodated in various inns before being sent back to their native places. According to the refugees' representatives, the Korean riot was indeed instigated by the Japanese in secret. Before the outbreak, Japanese police warned the Chinese residents that Koreans would take actions detrimental to the Chinese residents, ordering the Chinese residents not to go out after eight o'clock every night, otherwise they would not be responsible for any danger. Unexpectedly, at ten o'clock on the night of the 2nd of this month, a riot suddenly broke out. The Korean people, each carrying iron bars and iron hooks, were led by the Japanese police to search houses, committing abuse at will. The lightly injured suffered bruises all over their bodies, while the severely injured died immediately. Small children were split in half by their legs. In Pyongyang alone, more than three thousand Chinese residents have died. When the incident occurred, the Japanese police either guided and directed or helped the Koreans to massacre the Chinese residents. There is no doubt that this was a planned and organized act. The representatives said that when they spoke of the Korean cruelty and inhumanity, they lost their voices in grief, and all who heard it were furious. The representatives also said that all Chinese residents with assets and knowledge, and the seriously injured, were prohibited by the Japanese from leaving the country so that outsiders would not understand the truth. Because they were laborers, the Japanese were willing to let them go, but before they left, the Japanese carried out extremely strict inspections, only allowing them to board the ship if they had nothing of value. Their means of oppression were used to the extreme. (July 15th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Reports on Refugees Arriving in Shandong</h3>
<p>Also Telegraphed Weihai and Yantai to Investigate the Number of Refugees in Detail</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Government, noting that a large number of overseas Chinese have been returning from Korea and landing in Yantai in recent days, and that refugees continue to arrive in Shandong at other ports, sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday (the 14th) to report on the situation of the refugees fleeing from Korea to Shandong. It also telegraphed the Yantai and Longkou Public Security Bureaus and the Weihaiwei Administration Office to ascertain the number of refugees fleeing from Korea to Shandong, so as to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for future negotiations with Japan. The telegram is transcribed as follows: (1) Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: Since the Wanbaoshan incident in Jilin, newspapers have reported increasingly severe Korean riots, and overseas Chinese have been brutally massacred. We have previously telegraphed the National Government to negotiate with the Japanese side to stop the riots and provide relief. Recently, it has been found that a large number of overseas Chinese from Incheon, Wonsan, and other places have fled back to Yantai to seek refuge, and there are also many refugees returning to other coastal ports. This proves that the Korean people are brutal, and the reports in the newspapers are all factual. At the beginning of this incident, the Korean people disregarded public reason and acted violently first. Recently, they have relied on their power to massacre overseas Chinese. This is clearly done under instruction, hence they dare to be so brutal and violent. All citizens share the same indignation. In addition to telegraphing the Yantai and Longkou Public Security Bureaus and the Weihaiwei Administration Office to ascertain the number of people returning to seek refuge, we will further report to your ministry. Your department's efforts to defend against insults and protect the country have their own weight. Please quickly negotiate seriously with the Japanese side and immediately stop the violence to uphold humanity and maintain national rights, and hope to see a reply. Shandong Provincial Government, cold seal. (2) Telegram to the Weihaiwei Administration Office: Telegram to the directors of the Yantai and Longkou Public Security Bureaus: The Korean riots and massacres of our compatriots in the Jilin Wanbaoshan case have been publicized in the newspapers, and we are filled with indignation. We have previously telegraphed the National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate seriously with the Japanese side to immediately stop the violence, which is on file. Recently, we have heard that there are many refugees returning from Incheon, Wonsan, and other places to the coastal ports of Shandong Province. It is urgent to ascertain the number of people entering the country so as to report it for negotiation. In addition to sending this telegram, we hope you will order an investigation and reply. Shandong Provincial Government, cold seal. (July 15th)</p>
<h3>Minister of Foreign Affairs Reports on Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The Korean Case and the Wanbaoshan Case Will Be Handled Separately</p>
<p>Telegrams to the U.S. to Investigate the Scope of Suspension of War Debt Payments</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting hosted a press conference on the 17th to report on the Korean incident and the Wanbaoshan case as follows: (1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches great importance to the Korean incident. The Japanese government has formally replied, stating that it is making every effort to stop the riot. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that although the riot has subsided, our consulates in Korea had heard about the incident before it occurred and warned the local authorities, requesting them to protect the overseas Chinese with their strength. However, the authorities were unable to stop the riot for several days after it broke out. Our government believes that the Japanese claim to have made every effort to protect the overseas Chinese does not correspond to the facts. We have sent another note to solemnly declare this point and reserve all rights to negotiate damages. (2) Ambassador Wang, stationed in Japan, has arrived in Seoul and is urging the staff of the consulates in Korea to work with the local authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese. After a detailed report arrives in Beijing, we will report it to you. (3) The losses suffered by the overseas Chinese in Korea this time are enormous. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has remitted over 10,000 yuan to handle relief matters. As for the issue of future compensation, as the amount required is still unknown, it will be decided by the next meeting of the Central Political Council after Ambassador Wang's report. (4) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that responsibility for the Korean case should be clearly defined. Although the Japanese replied that they made every effort to protect the overseas Chinese, this does not correspond to the facts. Therefore, we have sent another note. As for the negotiation of damages, it must wait for Ambassador Wang's report before it can be raised. (5) Although the Wanbaoshan case is related to the Korean case, it will be handled separately because of the different nature of the cases. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formulated a solution to the issue of dual nationality of Koreans, which will be discussed when negotiations on the Wanbaoshan case begin.</p>
<p>Minister Wang then reported on the recent diplomatic situation as follows: (1) The treaty between China and Poland came into effect on July 9th. According to international procedures, the documents of ratification should be formally exchanged. It is now scheduled that the representative of Poland, Wei Dentao, will formally exchange the documents today. (2) The Turkish Chargé d'Affaires has returned to his country on the order of his government. The Turkish embassy in China has temporarily suspended its offices because no one is in charge. Because no one is acting as an agent for the Sino-Turkish treaty, the future signing can only be executed in Europe, probably at an embassy in Paris or Geneva, where the Turkish representative stationed there will jointly sign. (3) The agreement on the recovery of the French Concession in Shanghai is expected to be signed next week. (4) Regarding the issue of the suspension of war debt payments in Europe, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Rong Kui, the agent stationed in the United States, to investigate because it is not aware of its scope. (5) During his visit to Beijing, in addition to negotiating the Korean case, Chongguang raised the issue of legal rights between China and Japan. Our side submitted an answer to Chongguang to forward to the Japanese government.</p>
<h3>Policy of Invading Manchuria and Mongolia</h3>
<p>Russo-Japanese Transportation Conference</p>
<p>Will Be Held in Harbin at the End of August</p>
<p>Russia and Japan Join Forces to Counteract Huludao</p>
<p>Osaka Correspondence: In order to resolve the railway disputes between Russia and Japan over the past 27 years, Japan has decided to hold a Russo-Japanese transportation conference in Harbin at the end of August. The participating organizations will be the Japanese Ministry of Railways, Mantetsu, Korean Railways, Kita Nippon Steamship, Osaka Shosen, the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the Siberian Railway Authority. The aim of the discussion is the competition for the export of goods through the ports of Dalian, Vladivostok, and Korea. For the sake of the prosperity of Vladivostok, the Soviet Union advocated that all goods from northern Manchuria exported to Japan via the Chinese Eastern Railway should pass through Suifenhe to Vladivostok for export, without passing through Korean Railways or Dalian, because the freight is 15% to 45% lower than that of the Japanese railway. However, Mantetsu believes that it has suffered great losses as a result. Therefore, Mantetsu convened a Eurasian Joint Transport Conference in Tokyo in early July. As a result of the meeting, the Japanese strongly opposed the freight rate between Manzhouli, Suifenhe, and Vladivostok proposed by Russia, but the Russians also vehemently rejected the freight rate between Manzhouli, Andong, and Dalian proposed by the Japanese. Both sides have reserved the two cases. The Japanese are now vigorously promoting to the Russian side that the state-owned railway laid by China between Huludao and Qiqihar will soon be completed. In the future, the export goods from northern Manchuria will be taken away by the Chinese railway and exported through Huludao, and the Chinese Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway will suffer the same pain. Therefore, Russia and Japan need to unite to counteract Huludao and open up this difficult situation and resolve the previous splits between Russia and Japan. Based on this propaganda, the meeting will be held again.</p>

<p>Republic of China, Year 20, July 18th, Saturday (11) [Third Sheet H]</p>
<h3>News in Brief</h3>
<p>Mantetsu convened a Russo-Japanese transportation conference in an effort to unify the freight rates of the railways of Russia and Japan, jointly counteracting the Chinese railways and carrying out the invasion of Manchuria and Mongolia. Thus, the collusion between Russia and Japan to plot against us is becoming increasingly urgent. (July 14th)</p>
<p>Troops from Jin and Li</p>
<h3>Pursue Mutinous Troops of Gao Guizi's Command</h3>
<p>Two Companies from Feng's Division Also Cooperating in the Attack</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: After the mutiny in Pingding, Gao Guizi's troops were immediately pursued by other units and fled to Yu County. Recently, a small unit fled to Wutai, looting along the way. Li Fuying, Division Commander of the Fifth Division, considering Wutai to be his division's defense area, feared that the bandit soldiers would wander and harass Dingxiang, Yan County, and Xin County. In addition to telegraphing Li Zaixi's regiment to rush to Taihua Town, Wutai City, and Ekou, which belongs to Dai County, to block the bandit soldiers, he specially took a special car with several adjutants to Yuanping and went to the front line for inspection yesterday. According to Li's report when he left Jing yesterday morning, Tan Benren's trip to the front line was entirely for the sake of public security. In addition to taking his adjutants Xing Shuqian and Chang Wenxiang, he also had several detectives and ten grooms. After arriving in Yuanping, he planned to send several officers to the Wutai area to urge the various units to find ways to block and suppress the bandit soldiers, and send detectives to secretly search for them in the area where the defeated soldiers passed, determined not to allow anyone to hide. It is reported that two companies of Feng Pengzhu's troops have now rushed to Bolin Town to assist in the encirclement and suppression. It is thought that these few defeated soldiers will be easily resolved soon. As for the details of the rebellion in Pingding by the troops, the report from that side is as follows: It is reported that most of the officers and soldiers of Gao's division's Han unit are students, and some of them have been instigated by the communists. This time, the mutiny of the second battalion of the first regiment was initiated by the company commander Liu. As for the soldiers, most of them blindly followed. This action was purely directed and controlled by junior officers. On the evening of the 4th, before the soldiers' mutiny, the师特务连某头目 (chief of the division's special service company, sergeant or lower) reported to the division headquarters. Jin, the staff officer, then deployed defenses. Fortunately, the situation did not spread. It is learned that the mutinous soldiers had made a plan to rebel the previous month and then decided to riot at 12:00 p.m. on the 4th of this month. That morning, they used small leaflets to notify a certain chief of the special service company to take a bath in the bathhouse, so as to reach the time of the riot (12:00 p.m. on the 4th). Then, a certain chief immediately reported to the division headquarters. The division headquarters made timely preparations for defense. The mutinous soldiers learned that the matter had been leaked and changed the scheduled time to two points earlier (10:00 p.m.) to take action. At that time, the mutinous soldiers formed a team to attack the upper city (the headquarters was stationed there). When they reached the city slope, it happened that the division headquarters had also moved the special service company and the military police company to protect the headquarters and sent another elite force to defend the point commission residence (the point commission was stationed in Pingding Middle School in the upper city). Two machine guns were also placed in front of the city building in the upper city. When the mutinous soldiers arrived, they immediately opened fire and pounced. They were immediately swept by machine guns on the city. The mutinous soldiers suffered more than ten casualties. Knowing that it was difficult to succeed, they retreated and gathered in Dongguan, fleeing in panic and unable to rob the citizens. This was a great fortune. The mutinous soldiers fled through Baiyangshu Station at 1:00 a.m. on the 4th and fled to Yu County early in the morning on the 5th. On the 7th, it was heard that the pursuit team sent by the division and the artillery unit stationed in Yu County had jointly surrounded and defeated them. The troops of Feng Pengzhu stationed in Jingxing were also notified to find ways to cooperate in the attack. They are now trailing. It is said that the mutinous soldiers are still entrenched in Shipan Mountain (between Jingxing and Yu County). The division has telegraphed the troops stationed in Shijiazhuang and other places to find ways to block the pursuit. (13th)</p>
<h3>Cultural Exhibition by Daming Lake</h3>
<p>Brick and Tile, and Book Exhibition</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Library, in order to awaken the public's attention to and interest in preserving antiquities and culture, is preparing to hold an antiquities exhibition. It has now been decided to hold two exhibitions simultaneously from the 21st of this month: one is the Qin and Han Brick and Tile Exhibition, and the other is the Rare Book Exhibition. The exhibition period is three days and is open to the public, but in reality, what is exhibited is not only bricks, tiles, and books. The content of the exhibition includes: (1) Qin and Han bricks and tiles collected by the Gao family in Weixian, that is, those confiscated by the Department of Education in Qingdao, with the addition of Pan Gu Xiaolu tile end texts compiled by Xu Yinlin and the same brick texts; (2) Pottery pieces from Chengziya, that is, the antiquities obtained from the ancient Tanzi country in Longshan Town, which was excavated last winter; (3) Ancient coins from Luo Gu Lou, that is, those collected by Ma Guohan of Jinan Yuhan Shufang and now preserved in the library; (4) Han paintings, that is, those discovered in Teng County before the military incident last year, and those collected by the library over the years; (5) Books: (1) Old collections of the Haiyuan Pavilion of the Yang family in Liaocheng, which were scattered after the bandit riots and purchased by the library; (2) Antiquities of the Ming Dynasty Wenyuange, that is, butterfly-bound books stored in the old Qing Cabinet Treasury, which were purchased by the library this year; (3) Other rare books collected by Ma Huijie over the years, which were purchased by the library for 120,000 yuan, as well as rare books purchased sporadically one after another. Qilu is a cultural region with many antiquities. Since Luo Zhengjun founded the Shandong Library in Shandong during the former Qing Dynasty, the library has collected considerable amounts of bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings over the years. Since the current curator, Wang Xiantang, took office, Wang, who is proficient in bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings, has painstakingly collected and managed them, and the provincial government has been able to allocate large sums of money to enable the library to purchase them at any time. Thus, the ancient fragrance by Daming Lake competes with the scenery of mountains and rivers. This exhibition will be able to give the society immeasurable pleasure and give the public a good opportunity to speculate and test their cultural imagination. In order to expand publicity, the library specially wrote an article of more than 10,000 words on why bricks, tiles, and books should be exhibited, explaining the meaning of the exhibition and hoping to arouse the public's desire for knowledge of culture.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Has Become a Waterland</h3>
<p>The Disaster in Zhengyangguan Is Also Extremely Serious</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Continuous heavy rains and mountain floods in northern Anhui caused the Jiaojiang River to rise upstream of the Changhuai River, in the area of Fuyang, Zhengyang, and Sanhejian. Several places rose and the water surged downwards, flowing very turbulently. Although the weather here has been clear since the 13th, the water level of the Huai River has continued to rise. Today it increased by two feet, and it is already level with the bank. The water situation on the north and south banks east of the Iron Bridge is also tense. Several places have breached and overflowed, and the water flows horizontally, making it impossible to stop it. All the dikes have been submerged by the water. The water and the sky are the same color, and the wilderness is indistinguishable. The water north of Xiaobengbu is a vast expanse of water, and the autumn crops in the fields are all submerged. The sorghum in the water is already four or five feet high and only the tops are visible. The water on the south bank of Henan has poured into the city. The area around the east amusement park is like being in a water country. The thatched huts of the poor are like floating on the water. Large ships on the Huai River sailed into it and moored under the high embankment of the railway. The sails are like a forest. The Yaohua Electric Light Company is completely surrounded by water. The residents nearby rely entirely on sampans for transportation. Tangyuan has become a pool. Small boats sailed to the north end of Guofu Street and stopped at the entrance of Tangyuan. All the shops on Huachang Street, Deheli, Damalu, Zhengzhong Street, Ermalu, and Laodajie were flooded, and the drivers waded through the water, which was knee-deep. The scale of the flood can be imagined. The new straw sheds built by the victims on the vacant land north of Shunhe Street and the horizontal railway are countless, sheltering themselves from the wind and dew with wooden racks and mats. The Bengbu Flood Relief Committee has been very busy in recent days providing relief to the victims. Yesterday and today, it distributed relief funds at the General Chamber of Commerce, disbursing more than 4,000 yuan. The remaining victims who have not received the relief are still being investigated. Zhengyangguan, upstream, is an area where the waters of the Huai, Ying, and Fei Rivers converge. The land is low-lying. It is reported that due to continuous heavy rains and the Jiaojiang River rising in Sanhejian, the torrents poured down, causing the entire town to become a waterland. Four-tenths of the city walls collapsed, and five-tenths of the houses collapsed. The streets and markets are as if sailing in a river. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in sixty years. At present, the water level is still rising without receding. I do not know when it will end. (July 15th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Mining of Stones in Jiufeng Forbidden: The Jiufeng Mountains are located between Songjiang and Qingpu counties. There are many historical sites and they have long been known as scenic spots. The local residents near the area eyed the mountain stones and went to the official property bureau to apply for land to mine. Citizens of Qingpu, such as Ni Zhuhua, He Pancang, Zhao Pingao, and Sheng Langxi, petitioned the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to prohibit stone mining in order to protect the historical sites and maintain public safety. This newspaper has learned that the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Jiangsu Department of Finance to instruct the Songjinqing Official Property Branch Bureau and the Songjiang and Qingpu County Governments to prohibit it. The instruction is as follows: "In order to comply with the order, Ni Zhuhua et al. submitted a petition requesting a strict order to prohibit stone mining in Jiufeng's scenic spots to protect historical sites and maintain public safety." In addition to approving the petition and learning about the preservation of scenic spots and historical sites, which is within the scope of internal affairs, it should be directly submitted to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for investigation and verification. If there is any stone mining on the Jiufeng Mountain land released by the former Official Property Office, it should be prohibited at any time. It should be ordered that the Jiangsu Department of Finance follow the instructions and instruct the Songjinqing Official Property Branch Bureau and the Songjiang and Qingpu County Governments to follow this order."</p>

The sixteenth branch of the district's Public Security Bureau became aware of this, and Bureau Chief Xia Chungang dispatched employee Liang Cuiting and patrol officer Peng Xialing with police to investigate. They apprehended four gamblers and gambling paraphernalia on the spot. As they were about to escort them back to the bureau, over a hundred villagers bravely rushed forward, surrounded them, and snatched the four captured gamblers. Then, Tu Zheng (local head) Yu Yulin, fearing that the police were imposters due to their lack of uniforms, urgently rushed to Patrol Officer Liu Ziyan of the third sub-division of the second squadron of the police brigade stationed in the town, reporting that communists were rioting and requesting assistance. Patrol Officer Liu, upon receiving the report, quickly led police to the teahouse. There, they found seven people surrounded by villagers. Liu immediately inquired and learned they were officers arresting gamblers under orders, and that they were trapped. Tu Zheng Yu Yulin testified that the town was robbed by communists in April of the previous year and that four men and women were kidnapped and only released after several months. He claimed that the police were not wearing uniforms, had no official business, and might be up to no good, hence the request for their arrest. Patrol Officer Liu, based on the testimony, escorted the seven officers, including Liang Cuiting, along with Tu Zheng Yu Yulin, to the brigade headquarters. Public Security Bureau Chief Xia Chungang also prepared a written report and submitted it to the Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>County Magistrate's Daughter-in-Law Requests Divorce: Yang Zhonghan, a native of this county, served as the Magistrate of Wujiang County when Sun Chuanfang governed Suzhou.

Recently, Ms. Yu suddenly claimed that Yang Baochun smoked red pills (heroin) and that his lower body was infected with syphilis. She hired a lawyer and sued the county court for divorce, requesting alimony of 30,000 yuan and the return of her dowry worth 4,000 yuan. Yesterday was the date for the court hearing, and the people of the county, impressed by Ms. Yu's reputation, crowded to listen. During the hearing, Judge Liang first heard Ms. Yu Ranxian recount the history of their love and state her purpose, while Yang Baochun claimed that he did not have venereal disease initially and only contracted it after engaging in carnal relations with the plaintiff. Lawyers from both sides debated the results. Judge Liang ordered the plaintiff to instruct the defendant to go to the hospital for verification.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Police Team Opens Fire on Bandits: On the evening of the fourteenth, the home of Chen Zhaosheng in Chenjia Lane, fourth district of Wujin County, was robbed by bandits who kidnapped Chen Zhaosheng to Chenshu Village and released him.

<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Dispute in Taicang Shipping Industry: Mr. Huang and others from this county believed that there was still a need for a steamship route from Shatou to Kunshan via Zhoushi. To facilitate transportation, they founded the Kunxing Steamship Company, obtained a license from the Ministry of Transportation, a permit for inland waters from the Jianghai Customs, and filed with the Kunshan and Taicang county governments and the Construction Bureau, requesting an operating permit. However, a Mr. Li, who claims to be from the shipping industry association, filed a petition with the Taicang county government, claiming that the ship's hull was narrow and its materials were substandard, attacking its safety. It is said that the manager of the Kunxing Steamship refuted this claim, stating that the Kunxing Steamship had been inspected by customs and found to be safe. The Jianghai Customs issued a permit allowing it to operate, and only the Jianghai Customs ship inspection office has the authority to determine the safety of a vessel. Mr. Li and others from the shipping industry association were acting unreasonably and creating trouble without understanding the situation. It is also said that the Qin Yu and Da Liang steamships also lack operating permits.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Notice</h3>
<p>Students Should Not Enter Unregistered Private Schools</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued a notice stating, "Now is the summer vacation, and many young students are preparing to apply to schools for further studies or transfers. When applying, it is important to investigate whether the schools are well-managed. If they are private schools, it is even more important to first inquire whether they are registered. Students from unregistered private schools are not accepted for transfer or further studies in public and registered private schools. Graduates from unregistered private schools cannot apply for overseas study examinations, civil service examinations, general examinations, or various civil servant technical personnel examinations. They are also unqualified to serve as staff in various agencies or teachers in various schools. Therefore, entering an unregistered private school now will cause many difficulties in future education and employment. Rather than facing difficulties later, it is better to be cautious and prudent when applying now. The Bureau will follow the Ministry of Education's instructions to ban private schools that refuse to register. We hope that parents of students will pay attention to the schools that their children apply to and not enter unregistered private schools again. This is of great importance to your children's future, so please do not ignore it."</p>

<h3>Van Hang's Skills Weakened</h3>
<p>Commercial University Fortunate to Win</p>
<p>Result: 34 to 31, Defeating Van Hang</p>
<p>Tonight at 8 PM at the Original Field, War Eagles Team</p>
<p>The Commercial University basketball team played Van Hang last night at 8 PM at the China Basketball Hall. Over 400 spectators, half Japanese and half Chinese, watched the game. The strength of the two teams was far superior to Van Hang, but the circumstances of each team were different. One team had been out of competition for a long time, while the other was in training. Commercial University's victory was entirely due to luck. If played another day, Van Hang would win easily. The result was 34 to 31, Commercial University won. Referee: Jiang Xiangqing.</p>
<h3>Van Hang Sweats to Fight Stubborn Enemy</h3>
<p>Diao Youdao Shows His Ability, Qian Jingyong Plays as a Guest</p>
<p>The Van Hang generals had not been on the battlefield for a long time, and their weapons had already rusted. At that time, it was inevitable that they would be unfamiliar with the game. Diao Youdao showed his ability and repeatedly broke through the enemy camp. Qian Jingyong's guest appearance greatly increased the team's strength. He was trapped at the start but quickly moved up. Diao and Chen, old partners, repeatedly collaborated. The whole team used high passing to defeat the enemy. In the first half, they repeatedly gained the upper hand, leading 4 to 3, 8 to 6, and 13 to 8. The final score was 14 to 16, losing momentum due to a lack of energy. In the second half, Diao Youdao became excited and fiercely attacked the enemy's fortress, scoring five goals in a row, a total of seven goals, making him the highest scorer in the two teams. At that time, the two sides were only one point apart. Before the last six minutes, Van Hang was still leading 30 to 27, but due to a lack of strength and fatigue, they watched the enemy become active and win. However, skill is one thing, and victory or defeat is another. One cannot simply judge heroes by victory or defeat.</p>

<h3>Commercial University Recruits Brave Generals</h3>
<p>Skills are Not as Good as Others, but Combat Strength is Strong</p>
<p>Commercial University's skills are ordinary, but its combat strength is strong. The reason why it almost lost to Van Hang was the former, while the reason why it finally won was the latter. Commercial University was often helpless under the tall and strong generals, but it was able to win by using lively movements and enduring stamina. Therefore, in terms of the overall situation, Commercial University won with a final flash. It does not seem difficult to break Commercial University's five-man defense strategy. Among the whole team, Yongai and Shanxie have the best throwing skills, while Jinzi is good at receiving but is not suitable for the center position due to his short stature. In the second half, the team encountered danger several times, almost failing, but fortunately the opponent's strength was weakened, allowing them to win with 34 to 31. They also led 16 to 14 in the first half.</p>

<p>South China Football Team's Southern Expedition to Java, Second Match (1)</p>
<h3>Wins 3-2 Against Bandung Luno Team</h3>
<p>(Xuelou from Bandung) The South China Football Team, renowned in Java, immediately embarked on an eastward expedition to Bandung the day after their draw in Batavia on June 7th. Their opponent was the Luno team, champions of Bandung. As a result, football fans from all over Java flocked to Bandung.</p>
<h3>Much Discussion and Speculation About the Outcome</h3>
<p>Before the battle commenced, there was much discussion on all sides regarding the outcome. One view was that South China's forwards were incredibly sharp and their defense was like an impregnable wall, so victory was assured. Another view was that Bandung teams have always had the reputation of being "fierce at home," and it is not easy for visiting teams, no matter how strong, to win. For example, the Lok Wah team did not achieve good results in either of their two visits. Even teams from other cities on the island, as strong as Surabaya, have often suffered defeats here. Even when the national team sends its elite to compete against individual teams from various cities, victories are rare. Therefore, Luno's victory or defeat cannot be judged solely on strength; it depends entirely on home advantage and local support. With all these rumors, this match was sure to be a good show, and the battle situation was certainly worth watching. Therefore, spectators of various nationalities from Bandung and neighboring cities enthusiastically came to see what was sure to be a rare event.</p>
<h3>Teams Line Up, Testing the Waters First</h3>
<p>At 4:25, the South China team, led by Captain Bao, entered the field. The whole team was full of energy and vitality, testing the waters. At 4:30, the Luno team also entered the field, radiating a murderous aura, as if they were prepared to die on the battlefield rather than lose their territory. They also briefly tested the waters. Then, Mr. Zeng Yingzhang, representing the organizing committee, presented a wreath, followed by Mr. Zheng Yuanquan, representing the Bandung Football Association, and Mr. Chen Zehe, representing the Youth Association, each presenting a wreath. Then, they chose their positions and deployed their formations.</p>
<p>The formations of the two sides were as follows:</p>
<p>South China Formation</p>
<p>Liang Yanzan, Ye Beihua, Li Tiansheng, Li Huitang</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Huang Meishun, Feng Jingxiang, Tan Jiangbai</p>
<p>Zhu Guolun, Liang Rongzhao, Zheng Shaokang</p>
<p>Luno Formation</p>
<p>Lajia Sha, He Sen, He Duoluo, Yu Dousi</p>
<p>Fan Le Ke, Bai Shengna, Daerma, Wu Hongsi</p>
<p>Sierya, Ximen, Helala</p>
<h3>Equal Shares, Each Side Wins One</h3>
<p>After the lines were set, Zeng Yingzhang entered the field to perform the opening ceremony. The silver whistle blew...</p>
<p>The intense battle began. Feng Jingxiang took the lead, leading his troops to attack. The enemy also launched a major counterattack with great momentum. Fortunately, the two defenders were strong and well-positioned, repelling everything. They then gained a free kick on the right side of the midfield. Li Tiansheng shot directly at the goal. The shot was excellent, hitting the post and bouncing out. Ye Beihua followed up, sweeping the ball diagonally out of the field. The effort failed. Ye Beihua's failure led to trouble. Luno's forces suddenly surged, creating a deafening momentum. The right winger dribbled straight in. South China's two defenders could not stop him, and he was overtaken by the enemy's left midfielder. Seeing the situation was not good, goalkeeper Bao went out to meet the attack, but it backfired. The enemy's left midfielder bypassed the two defenders and, seeing that the goalkeeper had come out, sent the ball into the net with a smooth kick. 1-0. Before Luno's joy could subside, South China had already led a large force to retaliate. Left midfielder Liang Yanzan intercepted the enemy's ball and dribbled it up the field, passing it to the flank. General Zheng received the ball, took a few steps, and then fiercely passed it inside. The ball landed right in the goal area. Ye Beihua chased after it, leaping up and heading the ball straight into the net like lightning, breaking the enemy's "egg" and creating a tie. 1-1.

The following official documents and notices have been communicated:</p>
<p>Telegram 1 To: Singapore, Penang, Australia, Canada, America, Sydney, Victoria, New York, San Francisco, Philippines, Honolulu, Southern Vietnam, Batavia, Surabaya, Siam, Chinese Chambers of Commerce: Since the 4th, Chinese nationals in various parts of Korea have been persecuted by Korean mobs. For several days, thousands have been killed or injured, and over ten thousand have lost their jobs and are returning home. Without relief, Chinese commerce in Korea will be utterly destroyed. Our Chamber has initiated fundraising, but we fear our resources are insufficient. Your compatriots reside in foreign lands and have experienced many hardships. Upon hearing this terrible news, we feel the pain as if it were our own. Please provide vigorous assistance, collect a substantial sum, and remit it to our Chamber at any time for transfer. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Telegram 2 To: All Chambers of Commerce Nationwide: The severe and tragic situation of the persecution of Chinese nationals by Koreans instigated by the Japanese has been reported in the newspapers daily. The Japanese claim that the unrest has been quelled, but the vegetable gardens of Chinese farmers have been completely destroyed, and the goods of self-employed merchants have been looted. Even summer cloth about to be marketed has been left unable to be traded due to the destruction of the Chinese merchants' foundations. Only export has been stopped. Judging from the continuous return of Chinese nationals from Yantai to the mainland in recent days, with over a thousand people each time, it is evident that this Japanese conspiracy is using Koreans to act swiftly and decisively, eradicating the decades of hard-won Chinese commerce in Korea to achieve their economic annexation plan. The so-called "unrest has been quelled" is merely a euphemism for nothing left to destroy or loot, the goal having been achieved. Chinese merchants in Korea have historically and emotionally held a superior position compared to other countries. Since the annexation of Korea by Japan, the Japanese have repeatedly increased tariffs in an attempt to force them out. However, due to the Chinese's diligence and Koreans' reliance on the Chinese, the deep-rooted economic relationship of the Chinese over the decades has not been easily uprooted. Therefore, they have resorted to sowing discord and inciting ignorant Koreans to be their tools of murder. First, there was the anti-Chinese incident in 1927, followed by the current large-scale joint riots in various places, demonstrating a consistent policy containing international conspiracy. Although Chinese nationals in Korea come from all provinces, Shandong accounts for the majority. Shandong people who go abroad to make a living are found throughout Russian Siberia in the north and the eight provinces of Korea in the east, numbering hundreds of thousands. This helps to regulate the densely populated area, similar to how the southern diaspora of Fujian and Guangdong provinces relies on the Nanyang Islands. Since Russia implemented Soviet policies, all commerce has been nationalized, and Chinese nationals have no place to stand there. The only area they rely on for foreign development is this corner of the Korean peninsula. If they suffer unexpected adversity again and submit to fate without seeking rescue, it will be seen that our country's commerce with Korea will decline, and Shandong's surplus population will have no place to migrate to. Its impact on the future of the nation is significant and should not be viewed as a local disaster to be ignored. Therefore, planning for the aftermath of the Chinese nationals is to provide full assistance from the entire nation, regardless of whether they have returned home or not, so that they can reorganize their assets and restore their old businesses, so as not to be defeated and allow the Japanese conspiracy to succeed. The areas where Chinese nationals have been harmed this time, such as Pyongyang, Incheon, and Seoul, are all important cities or commercial centers. The losses are likely to exceed ten million. Although our Chamber has launched a fundraising campaign to help Chinese nationals, the purpose of this assistance is not for temporary relief but for business recovery. Therefore, it is not enough to call on all the magnates to raise large sums of money for coping. Therefore, the 17th Executive Committee meeting of our Chamber decided to telegraph to various chambers of commerce to voluntarily initiate a sustained and effective economic severance with Japan and to unanimously assist in collecting funds to help the Chinese nationals who have been harmed in Korea. Please record the case and convey the telegram, hoping that your esteemed association will enthusiastically support it with the heart of rescuing those in peril, start fundraising immediately, and remit the collected amount to our Chamber at any time for transfer or directly to the Chinese Chambers of Commerce in Korea. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Telegram 3 To: All Chambers of Commerce Nationwide: Regarding the Japanese instigation of Koreans to persecute Chinese nationals, our Chamber has resolved to telegraph for fundraising assistance and to automatically lead the business community in economic severance with Japan. The case has already been telegraphed separately. Economic severance with Japan has been held repeatedly in recent years, but each time, various sectors have led in front and merchants have followed behind. In terms of its previous effects, the following two drawbacks are unavoidable: (1) Since the leaders are from various sectors, they cannot fully understand the actual situation of the goods, so there are often cases of mistaken detention and fines. Even if the matter is repeatedly appealed and clarified, the merchant's unexpected losses are uncountable. (2) Since there are mistaken detentions and fines, one party is busy appealing, which inevitably diverts their energy for external affairs, and the actual work of economic severance is inevitably relaxed. Moreover, merchants who have been mistakenly detained and fined are inevitably discouraged and lose their faith, resulting in their inability to resist for a long time. Summarizing the above two points, merchants cannot automatically take action for economic severance, and they themselves suffer endless pain, and resistance is difficult to achieve thoroughly, which makes the ambitious laugh from the sidelines and adds another humiliation to the national shame. Past economic severance failures are deeply painful. The motives for economic severance have mostly arisen from foreign political aggression, but this time it stems purely from economic aggression. What they want to destroy is the commercial status of Chinese nationals in Korea. Therefore, those who are killed are merchants, those who are destroyed are shops, and those who are looted are goods. If they are trying to eliminate our merchants as their goal, and we turn to begging for their leftovers and relying on Japanese goods to survive, how can we not be insane to come to this? Therefore, today, whether it is for the sake of national survival, national dignity, or the interests of the merchants themselves, at this moment when the hideous face of economic aggression is fully exposed, merchants must rise up and take the initiative to direct the final victory. Otherwise, the suffering and humiliation will be tenfold more than today. Your esteemed association is a leader in the business community. If you accept these humble views, please convene all merchants to form a systematic organization for voluntary economic severance with Japan, so that this economic severance with Japan can fully exert its effectiveness, wash away the accumulated habits of starting but never finishing, not only for the glory of the nation but also to create an unprecedented record in the business community. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Notice 1 The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce urgently notified various trade associations yesterday, saying: We are forwarding a telegram from the Provisional Presidium of the Anti-Japanese Aid-Korea Grand Assembly of Various Circles in this city, stating (already seen in yesterday's newspaper, omitted) etc. The tragic massacre of overseas Chinese is a common indignation of the whole country. Stopping the import of Japanese goods and economic severance with Japan is the only way to deal with it. Please record the telegram and forward it to your industry colleagues for earnest implementation.</p>
<p>Notice 2 The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued an urgent notice regarding the cancellation of the organization of a delegation to Japan to investigate the Wanbaoshan and Korean Chinese victims cases, saying: In view of the fact that the Japanese have repeatedly organized inspection groups to come to China amid the worldwide economic downturn, and the new treaty between the two countries based on international equality is being negotiated by the government, the relationship between China and Japan in commerce may be opened in another way. The Chamber is canceling the aforementioned proposal for a commercial inspection group to Japan from this day forward, and hereby publishes this notice.</p>
<h3>Expressions from All Sides</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing's Statement: Since the Anti-Japanese Aid-Korea Grand Assembly of Various Circles implemented economic severance with Japan, Japanese merchants in Shanghai have been panicking. The Japanese Consul recently (the 16th) sent Vice Consul Shirai Yasushi, a member of the House of Representatives, Kato Taiichi, to visit the commercial leaders of the Anti-Japanese Aid-Korea Committee, Yu Qiaqing, to state that Ambassador Shigemitsu had gone to Nanjing to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to negotiate a settlement and that there would be a solution. Yu replied that the first step in this action against Japan was to stop ordering Japanese goods, the second step was to boycott Japanese goods, and the third step was to implement economic severance with Japan. Now it is still in the preliminary stage. If the Japanese authorities can realize this and find a satisfactory solution, then it may be possible to negotiate, otherwise the people should proceed with the second and third steps. Then they returned without getting what they wanted.</p>
<p>Statements from Industry and Commerce: The Shanghai Silk-Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry Association held a special members' meeting yesterday. Chairman Zhu Wenqi reported on the Wanbaoshan massacre. All members were extremely indignant and decided to automatically boycott enemy goods and submit concrete proposals to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Dyeing and Weaving Industry Federation for a unified approach. Pawnshops, laundries, leather shoe nailing and last-making industries, knitting industries, etc., as well as the Seamen's Branch, the Naval Special Party Department, etc., all sent telegrams yesterday to express their indignation.</p>
<h3>Shipping News Amidst the Boycott</h3>
<p>Japanese Goods Rushed to Shanghai: Since the incident in Korea, various circles in Shanghai have proposed economic severance with Japan, which is already in progress. Japanese people in Shanghai, hearing the news that goods ordered but not yet shipped to Shanghai may be blocked, telegraphed the Toyo Kisen Kaisha on the 14th to quickly load the large quantities of goods they had ordered and ship them to Shanghai. It has been agreed that the Japanese Post Office will send eleven ships to transport them. In addition, Yamashita, Kawasaki, Mitsui, and others have also temporarily dispatched a large number of merchant ships to Kobe and Yokohama to transport goods continuously. The first batch has already arrived in Shanghai, and they plan to send more ships before the boycott is formally launched. Yesterday, the Japanese Post Office specially convened Japanese merchants in Shanghai to discuss plans to expedite the loading. Large quantities of Japanese goods will arrive in Shanghai one after another and then be transferred to other ports.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Used to Ship Goods: The warehouses of Japanese shipping companies in Shanghai, such as Huishan, Osaka, and Pudong, have the most goods stored, mostly sugar, seafood, paper, and cloth. From the 14th, the Japanese merchants negotiated with Nisshin, Osaka, Dalian, and Butterfield &amp; Swire, and other foreign shipping companies to reserve cargo tonnage, shipping the goods stored in Shanghai warehouses within one week. About 70-80% of these goods were destined for the Yangtze River. The foreign ships, partly because of their national ties (Japanese ships) and partly because of business relations, have agreed. Therefore, foreign merchants' Yangtze River cargo exports have been crowded in the past three days and are being shipped urgently.</p>
<p>Preventing Smuggling to Various Ports: The Customs Brokers Association has learned that Japan has decided on a secret loading plan for cargo transportation. According to this plan, goods from Japan to Shanghai will be handled by Japanese customs brokers, who will only load them onto Japanese and British ships for export to the Yangtze River and the northern and southern oceans, but not onto Chinese merchant ships. This measure is to avoid the boycott, etc. Yu Senting, a director of the Customs Brokers Association, visited Yu Qiaqing yesterday to discuss with the Jianghai Customs to request them to report secretly on the arrival of Japanese goods and to refuse customs declarations for foreign ships to prevent the cunning scheme from succeeding.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Do Not Load Japanese Goods: Since the decision not to load Japanese goods has not yet been formally discussed, various Chinese shipping companies have not yet received any notice from any organization. However, out of conscience, various Chinese ships in Shanghai have automatically stopped loading Japanese goods, but this is an informal act.</p>
<p>Yesterday</p>
<h3>Pilot Full Strike</h3>
<p>Foreign Ships Blocked at Wusong Estuary</p>
<p>If Insistence on No Return to Work Continues</p>
<p>Customs Plans to Use Chinese Staff</p>
<p>The Foreign Ship Pilots Association has been on strike because their request for increased fees was rejected by the shipping companies. As of yesterday, they were on full strike. Ships coming to Shanghai from foreign countries were either blocked at Tongsha Lianghe Cave or arrived at Wusong but could not enter the port, and traffic has been completely halted. Yesterday, many ships coming to Shanghai on their own exported on their own without using pilots. The shipping companies met yesterday morning at the association to discuss rescue measures, but there was no hope of a solution. The content was kept highly confidential. After much inquiry by our reporter, it was learned that, according to the River Conservancy Department, in the event that the pilots insist, the shipping companies will decide to replace them with Chinese pilots in order to maintain maritime transport. The following is a detailed account of the information obtained:</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Cannot Enter: The starting point of the pilot line is Lianghe Cave outside Tongsha in Wusong, about four hours by sea from Shanghai. The most difficult part is the first section of Tongsha River. The pilot ship is stationed at Lianghe Cave, and the pilot comes to Shanghai. Since the shipping companies did not agree to increase the fees, all pilots have stopped work since yesterday, causing ships coming from Europe and the United States to stop at Tongsha and unable to enter the Huangpu River. The French postal ship D'Artagnan, a regular mail ship that could not be delayed, was piloted by the captain himself and also exported without using a pilot. Cargoes of other ships that have been blocked cannot arrive in Shanghai for unloading and are waiting for the matter to be resolved.</p>
<p>Meeting Unfruitful: The various shipping companies sent representatives to the association at 9:00 AM yesterday to hold a general meeting to discuss the matter. Representatives from European and American ships all attended the meeting to negotiate for a long time, and they did not want to announce the content. However, it was heard that there was no result under negotiation because the pilots were unwilling to give in. A temporary plan has been discussed regarding rescue measures.</p>
<p>Proposal to Employ Chinese Staff: The pilot strike</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>has lasted three days since the 15th and there is still no hope of returning to work. Shanghai is an international trade center, and the daily traffic of merchants and passengers from all countries is as usual. If this continues, maritime traffic will also be cut off. The River Conservancy Department of Jianghai Customs believes that there is no factual reason to increase fees. If they do not return to work, in order to maintain Shanghai's maritime traffic and international trade, the striking pilots will be suspended from their duties and the Customs will rehire Chinese staff from the Yangtze River Pilot Association. (Note: There are two pilot associations in Shanghai, one is the Foreign Merchant Pilot Association, which specializes in piloting foreign ships to Shanghai and currently has more than 30 people. There is only one Chinese, Mr. Zhang). The other is the Yangtze River Pilot Association, which is organized by Chinese pilots and is responsible for guiding the Yangtze River ships of various companies, which can avoid foreign ships being blocked at the Wusong estuary. Yesterday, the various shipping companies unanimously expressed their sympathy for this proposal. According to the state's planned measures, the implementation of recovering the foreign pilots' rights in Shanghai has been agreed upon by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc., to be completed by the end of 1933. From New Year's Day 1934, foreign pilots will be withdrawn from all parts of the country and replaced by Chinese pilots. The Navy is currently training this talent.</p>

<h3>Dismantled Reactionary Organization</h3>
<p>Confiscated Two Radios</p>
<p>Many Reactionary Criminals from Shanxi</p>
<p>A large number of reactionary elements were arrested in the French Concession. The details are as follows: The Municipal Public Security Bureau received a secret report that Yan Xishan had recently sent a large number of personnel to Shanghai to plot to disrupt the rear and attempt to achieve his goals, and to communicate with reactionary factions from all sides. Based on the report, Director Chen secretly ordered the Detective Captain to lead detectives and plainclothes officers to cooperate with the French Concession police detectives to rush to No. 208 Saposai Road, No. 13 Messer de Dillon Road, and a certain tannery in the western part of Shanghai, where more than ten Shanxi reactionary criminals, including Tian Yunqing, were arrested, and two radios, a secret telegraph codebook, and a volume of secret telegraph drafts were seized. A list of Shanghai military addresses and multiple entry and exit permits for welcoming Yan were found. The French police detectives took the suspects and evidence to the police station for interrogation. The Municipal Public Security Bureau is negotiating extradition. It is regrettable that when the arrest was made, two important criminals escaped because someone had tipped them off in advance.</p>
<p>Central Government</p>
<h3>Finalizing the Members of the Municipal Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>The list of candidates that doubled the number of positions to be filled for the Third Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, elected on July 1 by the Seventh Municipal Congress, was submitted to the Central Committee for finalization. The Standing Committee of the Central Committee decided the other day to finalize Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Du Gang, Jiang Huaisu, Chen Xizeng, Yang Qingyuan, Cai Hongtian, Tao Baichuan, and Chen Kecheng as the nine members of the Third Executive Committee of the Municipality; to finalize Zhou Feicheng, Hou Dachun, Zhu Yingpeng, Lu Jingshi, and Huang Shaoxiong as the five alternate members of the Executive Committee; and to finalize Wang Yansong, Tong Hangbai, Huang Xuchu, Deng Tongwei, and Xiong Shihui as the five members of the Third Supervisory Committee. Chen Bai and Zhang Zaibo were finalized as alternate members of the Supervisory Committee. All levels of party headquarters in the city were deeply pleased to hear that someone would be responsible for party affairs in the future.</p>
<h3>Zhu Yingpeng Resigns from Party Committee Position</h3>
<p>Reorganizing China Public School</p>
<p>No Time to Attend to Party Affairs</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Yingpeng, Secretary-General and Director of General Affairs of China Public School, has served two terms as a member of the Municipal Party Committee. Mr. Zhu is currently in charge of reorganizing China Public School, and he has no time to attend to party affairs. He previously went to Nanjing to explain the situation to the Central Committee and requested to resign, but his request was not approved. After the new Municipal Committee was announced, Mr. Zhu again submitted a resignation. The original petition stated that he has been serving in the journalism industry for many years and it is difficult to leave suddenly. Since he was appointed by the Ministry of Education this spring to take over China Public School, he is still working in the school after the reorganization. The affairs are both troublesome and lacking in spare time to attend to party affairs. Therefore, he specially requests to resign in order to concentrate on education, which is also serving the party indirectly.</p>
<h3>US Consul General Responds to Taxpayer Association's Letter</h3>
<p>Extremely Sorry for Unfortunate Incident</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association received a letter from the US Consul General yesterday, stating: "I have received your letter of June 4 of this year, in which you stated that certain unfortunate incidents have recently occurred between our nationals and Chinese residents in this city, and requested that I investigate. The purpose of your association's letter to request the attention of this Consul General on such cases is respected by this Consul General. As for the request to emphasize the friendly relations between China and the United States and to resolve these cases satisfactorily, this Consul General has also paid attention to it. This Consul General deeply regrets the occurrence of such misunderstandings between the people of your country and my country, and will do his best to eliminate them. This is something that your association can believe in without worry. Regarding the Gu Jingen shooting case and the case of Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang being harmed by US sailors, I am pleased to forward a copy of the letter sent to the Mayor of Shanghai today for your review. The letter details the US Navy Commander's solution to the case. As for the case of Dai Tingzuo accidentally drowning, the testimonies were contradictory, so it is impossible to ascertain exactly what happened at the time and the cause of the person's fall into the water. However, in order to comfort the peddler's father, a compensation of two hundred and fifty yuan was given to the US sailor who was present at the drowning. This case is closed. This office has not heard of the stabbing of Yang Jin'er, Sun Debao, Wang Jinfa, Ma Lin, etc. at Qichang Store. This case has not been reported to this office by the parties concerned or the Chinese authorities. If your association provides all the information, this Consul General will immediately order an investigation. In the letter from this Consul General to the Mayor, there is a sentence that reads, "This Consul General is extremely sorry for the unfortunate occurrence of the incident in the letter." It is hoped that your association will review it. One more point that this Consul General would like your association to pay attention to is that if such cases are submitted to the appropriate court to determine the guilt of the parties concerned, many misunderstandings can be avoided. Chinese and American people are willing to be good citizens who abide by the law. Therefore, whenever misunderstandings occur, the best thing to do is to resort to the mechanisms established by the two governments to resolve disputes according to law, rather than publishing harsh words in the newspapers of this city. This method of announcement does not help to resolve the case, but harms the existing cordial relations between the two countries."</p>
<p>The contents of the letter replying to Mayor Zhang are briefly as follows: The case of Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang has been publicly tried by a special military court organized by the US Navy Commander. It is reported that the Anhui Association also had representatives present to listen. The Chinese judge in the Gu Jingen case believes that the US sailor fired in self-defense, but if Gu Jingen's brother is not satisfied, he can appeal to the US Attorney's Office, which will be able to make a fair judgment.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau</h3>
<p>Officially Established on August 1</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Has Appointed Guo Bingwen as Director</p>
<p>The Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Visits Will Be Abolished After Establishment</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry previously ordered Guo Bingwen, Director of the Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Visits, on February 24 to start preparations for the International Trade Bureau. The organizational regulations have been submitted to the Ministry for revision and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government. The Legislative Yuan has now passed it, and the detailed rules of procedure have also been drafted by the Ministry of Industry. It is scheduled to be officially established in Shanghai on August 1, and Guo Bingwen has been appointed as the director. The internal four departments, including taxation, guidance, statistics, and compilation, have a monthly budget of 20,000 yuan. Its mission is to promote and guide international trade. After the official establishment, the Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Visits will be abolished. The candidates for the deputy director and the four department heads have not yet been announced. It is likely that they will be former members of the Bureau of Industrial and Commercial Visits. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Guo Bingwen yesterday and was received by Secretary Zhao Shutong, who said that the Bureau has not yet received the order to abolish it. The order to establish the International Trade Bureau next month and Guo's letter of appointment will probably be received within days.</p>
<h3>Port Quarantine Office Replies to Shipping Association's Letter</h3>
<p>Regarding Shanghai-Ningbo Ship Quarantine</p>
<p>The Port Quarantine Office has received reports from various parties that there have been cholera symptoms found in the city recently, and it is deeply feared that the disease will be transmitted to the interior. Therefore, it is planned to start with the quarantine of ships coming from Ningbo. The various Chinese and foreign shipping companies have been notified accordingly. The Taikoo and Jardine companies immediately complied and replied, while the various Chinese companies have mostly used</p>
<p>excuses to obstruct it. This matter is of great importance and must be carried out. Chinese merchants may not fully understand quarantine matters, resulting in deep</p>
<p>suspicion. Therefore, a letter was specially sent to the Shipping Association to explain. The original letter is excerpted below: In response to your letter of the 15th, saying [briefly, that the inspection of ships coming from Ningbo and the injection of cholera vaccine hinder traffic and affect business, etc.], the importance of quarantine has long been recognized internationally. It is only because the government decree is newly created that those who are ignorant may not fully understand it, so once the epidemic spreads, they run around in panic and do not know what to do, which is lamentable. Since the establishment of this office, the work of quarantining, exterminating rats, and fumigating ships for foreign ships has been convenient for everyone, and there is no such situation as described in the letter. According to quarantine regulations, reports must be made to the office 24 hours before the ship enters the port, and quarantine procedures must be carried out in the port. In order to facilitate merchants and travelers, it is only necessary for the medical officer to board the ship at the port and carry out quarantine and vaccination procedures along the way. When the ship is docked, it will be completed, ensuring that there will be no disturbance or obstruction of business. It is not necessary for everyone to be vaccinated, as described in the letter, and there are no fees or various difficult procedures. The country seeks happiness for the health of the people and seeks cooperation for the national health with the League of Nations. The establishment of official epidemic prevention is very different from other institutions. According to the report of the Public Concession Public Works Bureau doctor, cholera symptoms were found in Shanghai on the 9th of this month. If early prevention is not taken, the spread is worrying. It is appropriate for our Chinese shipping industry to share this understanding and assist in carrying out the epidemic prevention policy. Chairman Su and the committee members are highly respected and knowledgeable, and they are admired by the public. They are particularly enthusiastic in advocating for important policies for the welfare of the people. It is hoped that you will forward the letter to explain that there will be no more excuses to obstruct the promotion of the epidemic prevention policy.</p>
<h3>News of China Merchant Steam Navigation Company Vessels Delayed by Flooding</h3>
<p>Offshore: In the past week, a sudden flood occurred upstream in the Baihe River in Tianjin. The rushing water carried sand and mud downstream, causing the Baihe River to become severely silted up and shallow. Vessels with drafts of six feet or more are now unable to enter Tanggu, and both cargo and passengers must be transferred at Dagu. Various shipping companies in Shanghai have agreed to add a transfer fee of 1.68 taels per ton for goods destined for Tianjin, starting from the 19th. Therefore, the Ningbo and Shanghai merchants have been rushing to transport goods to Tianjin in recent days. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, due to the large volume of goods and the shortage of ships going to Tianjin, has also changed the routes of the "Nanhua" and "Yuanan" vessels to serve the Tianjin route.</p>
<p>Inland Rivers: Small steamboats on the inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been stopped by floods in various locations. Routes such as the Shanghai-Wuxi, Shanghai-Changzhou, Shanghai-Huzhou, and Jiaxing lines have all suspended operations for a week. Recently, the weather has cleared, and although water has been drained from the fields, the river levels have not receded. The Shanghai-Huzhou night service has resumed, and the daytime service resumed trial operations yesterday. The Wuxi line, due to the gradual receding of waters between Kunshan and Bacheng, resumed cargo services yesterday at the request of the business community. However, passenger services have not resumed, and the service will operate as a "slow train." The Changshu line is expected to resume operations in two or three days. Currently, inland river vessels are gradually resuming service, with only the Shanghai-Changzhou line remaining closed.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Shanghai Municipal Council Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council released the minutes of its regular meeting held at 4:30 PM on the 15th yesterday. In addition to approving the minutes of the Selection, Education, Engineering, and Police Committees, the Council discussed the request from the Japanese community to add a Japanese case officer to the General Office. However, due to the absence of Japanese councilor Fukushima, the matter was deferred. Regarding the objection from the American Club to the construction of the General Inspector's Office east of the club, the president of the club indicated that he would send another letter to the Council stating the reasons for the objection. The committee can consider the matter after receiving the letter. Additionally, the head of the Health Department suggested that Father Froc of the Xujiahui Observatory was about to retire and should be recognized for his outstanding achievements. After discussions among the councilors, it was decided to have the Chairman purchase a commemorative item, such as a silver shield. Furthermore, the nomination of Madam Chen and Mr. Zhu by the Chinese councilors to fill vacancies on the film review committee was unanimously approved. The meeting adjourned at 7:05 PM.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Committee Opposing American Soldiers' Atrocities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Committee Opposing the Atrocities of American Sailors sent representatives Zhu Ping'an and Zhao Shusheng to the Diplomatic Representative Office in Shanghai the day before yesterday to submit a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a letter to the Diplomatic Discussion Committee. Zhao Tiezhang of the Representative Office accepted and forwarded the letters. The submitted letters are extracted as follows: (1) A letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Regarding the barbarous atrocities of American soldiers, harming our compatriots, earnestly requesting a swift and severe protest to the American government, demanding punishment of the perpetrators, an apology, and compensation, and promptly and voluntarily recovering the concessions and extraterritorial rights to fundamentally resolve the situation and protect the lives of the people and the integrity of the nation. Since two months ago, American soldiers stationed in Shanghai have repeatedly used firearms to kill Gu Jingen, stab Qu Shixiang, Ma Ruixiang, and push Dai Tingzuo into the river to their death. Furthermore, American sailors in Qichang Pier in Pudong wielded weapons and injured Yang Jin'er, Wang Jinfa, Ma Lin, and Sun Debao. The news of these atrocities has enraged all of our countrymen. What have our people done to deserve such cruelty? In addition to demanding punishment of the perpetrators, an apology, and compensation for all losses, we request that your Ministry make every effort to negotiate to achieve these goals. As for the issues of concessions and consular jurisdiction, they are the shields for the unbridled behavior of American sailors. We urge your Ministry to abide by the resolutions of the National Assembly and strive to recover the concessions and extraterritorial rights in the shortest possible time. Our committee, together with all the citizens of Shanghai, will wholeheartedly support this effort. We urgently request your review and guidance on how to proceed, and we ask for your instructions with the utmost anticipation. (2) A letter to the Diplomatic Discussion Committee: Respectfully informing you that since two months ago, American soldiers and civilians have arbitrarily infringed upon the lives of our compatriots within our country's territory. The first incident was the case of American sailors shooting and killing Gu Jingen on April 24. The second incident was the case of American sailors stabbing Qu Shixiang and Ma Ruixiang. The third incident was the case of American sailors pushing Dai Tingzuo into the river to their death. The fourth incident was the case of American sailors stabbing Yang Jin'er, Sun Debao, Wang Jinfa, and Ma Lin. Such tragic incidents have occurred repeatedly. If we do not arouse public outrage and lodge a strong protest, future disasters will be even more imminent, and our people will have no peace. Our committee was formed by various circles in Shanghai and is now actively proceeding. We have always admired your committee as a pioneer in diplomacy. We dare to send you a letter detailing the situation and request that your committee raise it for discussion and provide guidance to facilitate our progress. We eagerly await your response.</p>

<h3>Record of the Opening of the Fishing Vessel Crew Training Session</h3>
<p>A Pioneering Initiative in China's Fishing Industry</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experimental Field, in light of the fact that foreign fishing vessels have been invading our coastal waters for over ten thousand yuan annually, and that our domestic fishing technology lags behind, has taken advantage of the summer ship repair and fishing moratorium period for various Chinese fishing vessels in Shanghai. They held the first session of the Summer Training Program for Fishing Vessel Crews at the Yucai School at Dadongmen, providing technical and academic guidance. This event is a pioneering initiative in China. The opening ceremony was held at 5:00 PM on the 16th. The chairman was Wang Wentai, the director of the field, and the master of ceremonies and recorder was Wang Liansheng. Attendees included senior crew members such as captains, engineers, and chief mates from various fishing vessels including Haixing, Yongmao, Lianfeng, Zhenning, and Jimei; Hou Chaohai and Chen Moulang, representatives from the Agricultural and Mining Department of Jiangsu Province; Yang Shuheng, captain of the Fuhai warship; fisheries experts Chen Zhunian and Zhang Junfeng; Wu and Li, representatives from the Zhejiang fresh fish merchants; Chen Shuyi, technician and captain of the experimental field; Zhang Zhuzun, technical director; Wang Liansheng, a member of the preparatory committee for the Provincial Fisheries Guidance Institute; Mao Jusheng, a fisheries correspondent; and employees from various fishing vessel companies, totaling over 50 people. The ceremony proceeded according to protocol. First, Chairman Wang Wentai reported the purpose of the meeting and compared trawl fishing industries in China and abroad. He expressed the hope that people would not be satisfied with the current situation and must strive for progress. He stated that although the planning for this event was not entirely complete, the professors hired were all fisheries experts, and the various charts and diagrams were made to ensure that the attending crew members fully understood them. It is also planned to continue holding various classified fisheries training sessions in the future so that our fishing vessel crews can fully acquire research opportunities. Next, Hou Chaohai, the representative from the Agricultural and Mining Department, gave a speech stating that the province's fisheries administration is divided into four types: (1) experimentation, (2) investigation, (3) guidance, and (4) research. Training sessions for crew members should be divided into three types: fishing vessel crew members, engine room personnel, and others related to the fisheries industry. Future training sessions should also be planned for those related to the fisheries industry, such as personnel from fisheries groups and cooperatives. Finally, he hoped that the attendees would pay more attention to literacy and transportation. Afterwards, the chairman reported on the types of courses and their outlines. The ceremony ended at 6:00 PM. Everyone had dinner, and then the first lesson of the class began at 6:30 PM. Chen Moulang lectured on the doctrine of the Party, and Wang Wentai lectured on the general situation of the trawl fishing industry. The lecture ended at 8:30 PM. The attending crew members rarely have the opportunity to attend such training sessions because they work hard at sea all year round, so they were very focused and orderly throughout the session, which was commendable. All expenses required for the session were borne solely by the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experimental Field. The training dates were from the 16th to the 31st, from 4:30 PM to 8:00 PM every afternoon. Dinner was provided for the attendees to save time. There were more than ten types of courses. In addition to lectures, Chinese and foreign fisheries films were screened from the 21st onwards to give attendees a sense of what was being discussed.</p>

<p>Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>Strictly Ordering All Labor Unions to Register According to Law</p>
<p>A One-Week Deadline Given</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday strictly ordered all labor unions in the city that have been established but have not yet registered according to law. It has been ordered that all labor unions established before June of this year that have not yet registered, having been previously notified by this bureau and the Public Training Committee of the City Party Headquarters in Announcement No. 3883 to apply for registration within a limited time, have now exceeded the deadline for many days, and there are still those who have neglected to comply. This is a disregard for the law. Therefore, in addition to issuing separate orders, this bureau urgently orders the relevant labor unions to comply and apply for registration according to law within one week from the date of this order. Any further delay will be deemed inappropriate. This order is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>Ding Shujing</p>
<p>A Report on Recent News from the Tianjin and Beiping YWCAs</p>
<p>Ms. Ding Shujing, General Secretary of the National Association of YWCAs, after returning to China from Europe and America, stayed in Shanghai for a short time and then went on a tour at the end of May, first to Hangzhou, then to Nanjing, Jinan, Tianjin, and Beiping, to observe the work of the YWCAs in various cities and discuss various plans with the directors and staff in those areas, as well as preparations for the third national conference next year and the YWCA World Conference to be held in China the year after. She has now completed her work and returned to Shanghai. According to Ms. Ding, the work of the various associations has made great progress, especially in Beiping and Tianjin, where there have been new developments. The Beiping YWCA, due to the presence of many schools in Beiping and the large number of students, especially female students from other provinces, has found that students from far away often find it inconvenient to find food and lodging. In order to make things easier for female students from various schools, the association has rented a building in Xiyuli Road and founded a dormitory and club for female students. The location is quiet, the building is spacious, and all modern amenities, such as running water, electricity, and telephones, are available. There are also various games and sports equipment available for after-class recreation. The opening ceremony was held on June 20. It is believed that female students from various schools will feel at home in this well-equipped dormitory. The Tianjin YWCA, due to the increasing development of its work, urgently needs to build its own building. This spring, it joined with enthusiastic people from all walks of life to launch a fundraising campaign to build a building, with a goal of 100,000 yuan. Important figures from the Party and the country, as well as famous figures from society, have donated silver cups and shields as awards for those who contribute to the fundraising effort. It is said that about 60,000 yuan has already been raised. Judging from the efforts of the fundraisers and the enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, it should not be difficult to achieve the goal.</p>

<h3>Actively Proceeding With</h3>
<p>The International Club</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Elected as the First President</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee Elects Seven Members Yesterday</p>
<p>The organization of an International Club was initiated by people from the Chinese and foreign banking and business communities to connect with each other and increase friendship, and it was decided to use the old site of the Greater China Hotel. A preparatory meeting was held at the office of the Yep Kwong Company yesterday afternoon at around 5 p.m. The following are the details:</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the International Club</h3>
<p>Eighty Chinese and Western figures attended yesterday, all enthusiastically supporting the proposal. The resolution to organize an International Club was unanimously passed as follows: [It is resolved that this meeting supports the proposal to organize an International Club at the Greater China Hotel, and that a charter should be drafted immediately and submitted to the general meeting to be held in September of this year for voting.]</p>
<h3>Speech by Mr. Sparke</h3>
<p>After the meeting was convened, Mr. Li Fusun proposed that Mr. Sparke, General Manager of Yep Kwong Company, be the chairman. Mr. Sparke's speech was as follows: [The true purpose of today's meeting is to solicit opinions on improving the organization of the International Club, to organize them, and to prepare a charter based on these opinions for submission to the General Meeting for approval. First, it should be explained that the Greater China Syndicate, which acquired the Greater China Hotel, intends to allocate a portion of the land, totaling 23.5 mu, together with the hotel, dance hall, Italian garden, and all its facilities, to the International Club for 1.2 million taels. According to the estimates of Katz &amp; Zeitlin and the opinion of Major Logan, the price demanded is exceptionally low, and its actual value is far more than this. Therefore, the Greater China Syndicate is very generous. The Greater China Syndicate was initiated and organized by seven Chinese and Western comrades, and its purpose is not to make profits, so the value of selling this property to the International Club is very fair. This is what should be stated first. Today's meeting was not convened for fundraising, as the required funds can be raised by issuing 6% bonds, and there is no need to raise additional funds. Mr. Li Shuxiong has sent a letter on this point, and his main points can be endorsed by us, and they will be raised when the financial issue is discussed later. We are almost all familiar with the need for international cooperation. However, empty words are no substitute for facts. This is an effort to organize a large club for people from all countries to meet and to seek practical progress. Shanghai has a prosperous commerce with both Chinese and foreigners. Such an agency is necessary, and the famous Greater China Hotel is the best venue for it. There has been little contact between Chinese and Western people in Shanghai, and there are inevitably various difficulties. The Greater China Hotel has a beautiful environment and a friendly atmosphere. If an International Club is organized there, it will give people from all countries a great opportunity to get to know each other, and Chinese and foreign societies will benefit from it. Important figures on the Chinese side are very sympathetic to this matter, and Mayor Zhang Yuejun has agreed to take the first president's post. This is a good omen for the success of the International Club, so I am happy to report this to you. The International Club has absolutely no political relations, and it is not allowed to be used as a political gathering under any circumstances. After its establishment, its dance hall and Italian garden can be used as a place for members to dine and dance, and its hotel department can be used for members' entertainment, such as playing billiards and mahjong. There are also a number of rooms available for members from other places to stay in Shanghai. This plan can preserve the Greater China Hotel as a place for commemorative social events. In addition to the Greater China Hotel, there is no other suitable place in Shanghai for this purpose. In the future, the committee may lease the club's buildings to others to meet this need, and there may be a small supplement to the revenue, but monthly rentals may not be more than twice a month. In order to avoid lengthy and confusing discussions, the most important points are listed on the agenda for discussion item by item, and I hope that your criticisms are constructive and not destructive. We all know that it is not easy to create such an agency and make it a success, but with so many people attending today and with enthusiastic support, we will be able to achieve the goals we hope for. Finally, there is one more word to say, that the club we are proposing to organize is not in competition with existing clubs or associations, as the Greater China Hotel can attract people mostly for large gatherings and post-meal entertainment. If this club is run successfully, a sports club will be established later, such as horse riding, tennis, polo, etc., which will be favored by young people in general, and young people will get the greatest benefit from this plan. Now, I will invite Mr. Li Fusun and Mr. Begel to speak, and then proceed to discuss the various issues.]</p>
<h3>Speech by Li Fusun</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Fusun's speech was as follows: The McBain Garden is the most beautiful garden in Shanghai, and the beauty of its construction and flowers and plants is praised by everyone. It was first owned privately, and when the Greater China Hotel was established, it was opened to the public. For several years, Chinese and foreign celebrities have gathered there for all kinds of good events. Last year, the hotel closed down, and the local people thought that the demolition of such a famous garden would be a great loss. Therefore, the Greater China Syndicate was created. The syndicate was initiated by seven Chinese and Western comrades who raised funds to buy the entire McBain Garden. Its purpose was not to make profits but to preserve this beautiful building and to fully open it to society. After a long period of discussion, it was decided to organize an International Club and allocate a portion of the most suitable buildings at the lowest possible price to the International Club to set up a high-class entertainment venue for all people to enjoy the benefits. Ten thousand merchants gather in Shanghai, and the personnel affairs are busy. The focus of our hearts and the words of our mouths are all on business. However, there must be a suitable place for public leisure. Now, with this International Club, Chinese and foreign men and women will be able to take a break from business and relax to wash away the dust and talk to each other to connect their feelings. The buildings, land, and ancillary equipment sold by the syndicate to the club are priced at 1.2 million taels of silver, and according to Katz &amp; Zeitlin's estimate, the total value of the land and buildings is more than 1.64 million taels, and the land alone is worth more than 1.29 million taels, which is enough to prove the huge sacrifice made by the syndicate. The intention of the initiators to maintain public welfare is shared by the public. This matter was jointly planned by Mr. Sparke, Chen Guangfu, and myself, and Mr. Sparke has done his best. The International Club will still be organized by Chinese and Western comrades to purchase the buildings, land, and other equipment. The funds will be the responsibility of the Chinese and Western initiators. The club plans to recruit 200 members, half Chinese and half Western, and 500 as basic members with the right to vote and be elected, and 1,500 as ordinary committee members. The amount of funds will be determined after a certain number have been raised, and a meeting will be held on a regular basis to elect appropriate personnel in an election manner to establish rules and regulations to manage all the measures to achieve perfection. It is planned to invite Mayor Yuejun to serve as the first president of the International Club, with the highest administrative officer of the local government as the leader of the highest and most beautiful club, which is welcomed by the public and will develop in the future. Daily affairs will be handled by one Chinese and one Western clerk. In short, the purpose of organizing the International Club is entirely for the sake of preserving the scenic spots and for the sake of Chinese and foreign reunion. There is absolutely no other purpose.</p>
<h3>Mr. White's Speech</h3>
<p>Next, Mr. White, the manager of Chen Mao Hang, gave a speech, roughly stating that the Greater China Banking Group's proposal to the International Club was admirable. He believed that the requested price of 1.2 million taels was extremely reasonable. He also said that Mr. Sparke and Mr. Li Ming had launched a very ambitious plan, and that everyone present should fully support and cooperate with them so that the plan could succeed. Following this, Mr. Sparke read out letters from Li Shuxiong, Zhu Boquan, Zhou Zongliang, Qian Xinzhi, Wu Yunzhai, etc., proposing that the initial membership be set at 500, with each member responsible for an initial fee of 500 taels and recruiting one to four new members, so that the million-dollar fund could be easily raised. As for issuing bonds with interest payments, this method seemed inappropriate. After discussion, it was decided to refer this letter, along with the proposer's suggestion to issue 1.4 million taels of bonds, half to be subscribed by Chinese and half by foreigners, to the preparatory committee for review and then to the general meeting for a decision. Regarding membership issues, Mr. Sparke proposed setting the basic membership at 500, with a membership fee of 200 taels, and the ordinary membership at 1,500, with a monthly fee of 15 yuan, payable in advance every six months. Women can only be ordinary members. All affairs of the club and the election committee, etc., will be managed by the basic committee. There will be no honorary members besides these two types of members. This proposal was decided to be submitted to the preparatory committee for review. Next, it was discussed that the club should have one Chinese and one Western secretary, as well as a first-class ballroom manager. Sparke said that in order for the club to succeed, it should recruit first-class talent. It was resolved to refer this to the preparatory committee for review. Afterwards, Mr. Sparke announced that the International Club had absolutely no political relationship, no partisan flavor, and would never hold any political gatherings.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhang Elected as President</h3>
<p>At that time, everyone present was extremely crowded, and they unanimously elected Mayor Zhang as the first president of the International Club. Mr. Sparke proposed that the vice president be elected after the membership quota was met, which was approved by the public. Yesterday, it was also resolved that all payments of the International Club should be made in cash instead of promissory notes to avoid the trouble of collection afterwards. Mr. Li Fuxun said that paying in cash was not difficult for Chinese members. It was then resolved to have membership forms printed. Foreign membership lists can be sent to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Mr. Broholm, and Chinese membership lists can be sent to the Central Bank, Mr. Zhu Boquan. A general membership meeting will be convened in September of this year to elect a committee and approve the club's constitution and various rules.</p>
<h3>Seven Preparatory Committee Members Elected</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee unanimously elected Li Fuxun, Chen Guangfu, Zhu Puquan, White, Bredon, Sparke, and White Lang as the seven members. The preparatory committee will be dissolved after the first general meeting is held. According to Mr. Liu Hongsheng's report, the General Affairs Committee of the United China General Association unanimously approved the proposal to organize the International Club. After the members of the United China General Association and the General Assets Corporation of the United China General Association pass the resolution, it will immediately merge with the International Club, and it is hoped that members of the United China General Association can join uniformly. At that time, Mr. Sparke, on behalf of those present, expressed gratitude for the spirit of friendship of the United China General Association. Finally, Mr. Speelman proposed to thank Mr. Sparke and Mr. Li Fuxun. The meeting adjourned at three o'clock.</p>
<h3>Smuggling a Huge Amount of Opium</h3>
<p>Leading to a Tragic Incident of Vehicle Inspection and Murder</p>
<p>A Large Amount of Sichuan Opium Arrived by Japanese Ship</p>
<p>Worth Approximately Fifty to Sixty Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Secretly Transported Late at Night with Prior Arrangement</p>
<p>Driver Interrogated, Deceased Autopsied</p>
<p>At 1:36 AM yesterday, the Huishan Police Station received a report from West Constable No. 107 stating that gunshots had been heard at the intersection of Zhaofeng Road and Broadway Road. The police chief ordered Detective Black and Chinese Detective Xu Yongyuan to investigate in detail. It was then discovered that someone was using a truck to secretly transport a large amount of opium. When the Indian constable saw this, he ordered the vehicle to stop. When the driver failed to comply, he fired his gun to stop him. One person was killed on the spot, and another was injured by a bullet. The details of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>No. 16, Hua Ji Road, Yihuo Lane, is the residence of Cai Guiji. Cai is in the transportation business and owns three trucks with license plate numbers 16661, 16728, and 16795. He employs truck drivers such as Du Chaozhuan, who comes from Tongzhou and lives at No. 110.5, Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road. Du has been working for Cai for nearly half a year, earning a monthly salary of 40 yuan. Du usually drives truck No. 16728. At about 10 PM the night before, Du had already returned home to sleep when Xiao Wuzi, Cai Guiji's assistant, arrived at Du's home, saying that he had been ordered by the boss to ask Du to go there immediately as there was something to entrust to him. Du immediately obeyed. When he arrived at Cai's house, Cai asked Du to drive the truck. At that time, truck No. 16661 was already parked on the road with two people on it, instructing Du to drive to the Gonghexiang Wharf at the end of Zhaofeng Road. Upon arriving at the wharf, more than 20 people were unloading 24 sacks from the Japanese merchant ship Guangyaowan. It was discovered that the ship had arrived in Shanghai from Sichuan and was docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf.</p>
<p>The 24 Sacks Were Filled with Sichuan Opium, totaling 2,088 pounds, worth 50,000 to 60,000 gold. They were all loaded onto the truck, intending to transport them elsewhere for sale. A man named Xiao Jinsheng was riding in the front of the truck with Du, instructing him to start the engine and drive forward. These people thought that it was late at night, everything was silent, and no one would know. Moreover, the goods were already on the truck, so there was no chance of failure. However, Indian Constables No. 617 and 644, who were stationed at the intersection of Broadway Road and Zhaofeng Road, had already</p>
<p>Discovered the Secret and Lay in Ambush at the Intersection, intending to arrest the truck when it drove out. At this time, four people resembling hooligans suddenly appeared at the entrance of the lane, responsible for keeping watch. Upon seeing the Indian constables investigating, they knew that the matter had been exposed. A man with a severed left arm took out ten yuan banknotes from his side and offered them to the two Indian constables as a bribe, asking them not to interfere in this matter. The two Indian constables</p>
<p>Accepted the Banknotes and Pretended to Agree. Before long, the truck transporting the goods drove towards them. The Indian constables raised their hands and ordered the truck to stop, but to no avail. At this time, the four people also stepped forward to try to stop the Indian constables from taking action. Indian Constable No. 617, seeing that the situation was critical, unloaded his rifle, loaded it, and pulled the trigger, first firing a shot into the air as a warning. The four people, knowing that the matter had been exposed, turned and fled. However, the truck transporting the goods still refused to stop and sped away. The two Indian constables each fired their rifles</p>
<p>At the Vehicle, Indian Constable No. 617 firing five shots and Indian Constable No. 644 firing two shots. At that time, Xiao Jinsheng was hit by two bullets, one in the abdomen, piercing his back, and the other in his right rib, causing him to fall in the truck.</p>
<p>Blood flowed like a spring. The truck driver, Du Chaozhuan, also sustained a bullet wound in his left hand and a graze to his abdomen. The truck's engine was also damaged and unable to move, so it stopped near Hua Ji Road. After the truck stopped, Du immediately got out of the truck and fled, but he was apprehended by the Indian constables, who were blowing their whistles frantically, with the help of Chinese Constables No. 1848 and 1958. Chinese and Western detectives also arrived after hearing the alarm. When they checked the truck, they saw that Xiao Jinsheng was on his last breath. They quickly sent him to Tongren Hospital, but he</p>
<p>Died upon Arrival. They then transported the body to the autopsy room on Ferron Road. They brought Du, along with the truck and opium, to the Huishan Police Station. Because Du was also injured, he was sent to the hospital for treatment. It was also discovered that the one-armed man's name was Xu Xiaogouzi, a hooligan from the Hongkou area, living at No. 260 Seward Road. Chinese and Western detectives went to Xu's and Cai Guiji's houses to arrest them, but both of them had already fled without a trace. They had no choice but to return to the police station and are currently conducting a strict investigation. At 8:00 AM yesterday, detectives from the police station took the truck driver, Du Chaozhuan, from the hospital and</p>
<p>Escorted Him to Court. First, the police station's acting lawyer, Li Zhishan, rose to give a detailed account of the above situation, stating that the police station was prosecuting the defendant, Du Chaozhuan, for the crime of selling opium under Article 6 of the Opium Suppression Law, requesting that the case be postponed in order to apprehend his accomplices. He then presented a package of opium</p>
<p>And a Bribe of Ten Yuan to the Court. Following this, the Chinese, Western, and Indian constables testified one after another, explaining the situation at the time. When questioned, the defendant, Du</p>
<p>Chaozhuan, testified that he had been driving for Cai Guiji for less than half a year with a monthly salary of 40 yuan. Last night, he had already returned home to sleep when Xiao Wuzi came to call him to drive. When he arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf, he only saw more than 20 people unloading sacks from the ship and loading them onto the truck. He did not know what was in the sacks and was not allowed to get out of the truck to see. After the loading was completed, the deceased sat with him in the front, and he did not see the people in the back clearly. He asked the deceased where they were going, and the deceased said, "You don't need to ask,</p>
<p>Just Drive." So, he started the engine and drove. Before he had gone a few steps, an Indian constable raised his hand and ordered him to stop. He was about to stop the truck when the deceased slapped him in the face and said, "Do you want your life?" He had no choice but to continue driving forward. When he heard the gunshots, he was terrified and lay down beside the truck, so the deceased drove the truck himself. That is why the Indian constable fired his gun and hit the deceased, and so on. Lawyer Zheng Wenkai then came to court and stated that the defendant</p>
<p>Had Sustained Bullet Wounds That Had Not Yet Healed, requesting that he be sent back to the hospital for treatment. The police station lawyer, Li Zhishan, immediately stood up and stated that the defendant could be sent to the police hospital for treatment and requested that the seized opium and the truck used to commit the crime be confiscated first. Judge Xiao Xiexun reviewed the testimony and ordered that the case be adjourned until the morning of the 24th for further questioning. The opium and truck No. 16661</p>
<h3>Page 16</h3>
<p>The Truck Was Stored in the Warehouse. By the time the case was examined, it was already past ten o'clock. The constable then took the defendant away and transferred him to the autopsy room. Meanwhile, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the Special Court arrived to examine the body of Xiao Jinsheng, ascending the bench to question the Chinese and Western detectives. Then, a woman named Yu Zhou, claiming to be 60 years old and from Wuxi, testified that the deceased, Yu Jinsheng, was her son, 28 years old, who ran a small restaurant at No. 295 Lao Street, Yuanfang Road,</p>
<p>And Requested to Claim the Body. Judge Guo then instructed, "It has been determined that the deceased, Yu Jinsheng, was shot and killed by an Indian constable. The truck driver, Du Chaozhuan, did not obey orders and has been prosecuted by the police station and should be sent to court for trial. The body of Yu Jinsheng is to be claimed and buried by his mother, Yu Zhou."</p>

<h3>After the Dissolution of Labor University</h3>
<p>Two Youths Attempt to Flee Upon Seeing Patrol Officers</p>
<p>Officials' Credentials Found on Their Persons</p>
<p>Now Sent to Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>After the Jiangwan Labor University was ordered to dissolve, the Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau was ordered to assist in the execution. Unexpectedly, when two youths saw the patrol officers, they jumped over the bamboo fence and attempted to flee. The patrol officers became suspicious and arrested both youths. A credential belonging to a Tan Dingfen was found on his person, a certificate for Tan Dingfen, Chief of the Communications Section of the Communications Department of the Land, Sea, and Air Headquarters, and a passport. A student ID card No. 492 from the Central Political School was found on a Peng Chenshun. They were taken to the Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District together. According to Tan, he was from Sichuan. This certificate was given to him by a friend, and he had no other intention but to ride the train without having to buy a ticket. He had never seen soldiers before, so he was afraid and ran away after seeing them. Peng claimed to be from Hunan and was indeed a student at the Central School. He came to Labor University to look for a friend and stayed for five days. He was inexplicably arrested by the patrol officers because Labor University was dissolved, so he went outside. It was deemed that the case involved impersonating an official, so it was submitted to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Frenchman's Car</h3>
<p>Fatally Hits a Pedestrian and is Peacefully Resolved</p>
<p>Wang A'yu, 40 years old, a local resident living at No. 32, Houmalu, Caojiadu, in the Western District of Shanghai, worked at Shenxin Textile Factory. His wife, Yu, is 42 years old and has two sons. The eldest son, Chang'an, is 18 years old, and the youngest is still young. Wang's old illness relapsed recently. On the 11th of this month, feeling slightly better, he went out on business and was walking near the bridge on the Jisi Feier Road Road when a car No. 2829 driven by a Frenchman named Jia Liyang (translation) sped past. Wang was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, injuring his abdomen. He was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. However, due to his old illness and the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died the day before yesterday. His wife, Yu, then went to negotiate with the Frenchman (who works at the French Electric Company). The Frenchman paid a condolence payment of 400 yuan and introduced his son, Chang'an, to a certain position. The family was quite satisfied, and the matter was peacefully resolved. The family prepared a coffin and proceeded with the funeral.</p>
<h3>Soldier</h3>
<p>Smuggling 110,000 Red Pills</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, Su, a patrol officer from the Yipinli police station of the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau in Zhabei Baoshan Road, was leading police officers to inspect passengers at the North Railway Station when he saw a soldier in full uniform carrying a suitcase and a bedding roll, acting suspiciously. The police officers stepped forward to inspect and discovered a large number of red pills, totaling 110,000, hidden in the suitcase and bedding roll. The soldier, along with the drugs, was taken to the Fifth District police station for questioning. The soldier claimed that he was Wu Mingsheng, from Nanhui, serving as a soldier in the 8th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Gendarmerie of the Capital Garrison Command. These red pills were being transported to Wuxi, worth approximately 500 to 600 gold at the current price.</p>
<h3>Robbery at a Shoe Store on Avenue Edward VII</h3>
<p>One Thief Apprehended on the Spot</p>
<p>Chen Minzhong, a local resident, opened the Tianyi Shoe Store at No. 533 Avenue Edward VII. At 9:30 PM last night, three robbers suddenly entered, pretending to buy shoes. They drew out their pistols, intending to start searching. However, an extremely alert shop assistant named Deng Zhengmao saw the robbers enter and tried to slip out the back door to call for help. He was spotted by one of the robbers, who chased him out the back door and grabbed Deng. At that time, many people were sitting in the alleyway to cool off, and they knew it was a robbery, so they blew their whistles together and assisted in the pursuit. The two robbers who remained in the store, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately fled, escaping south along the Xinxiao Bridge Street. As they fled to the iron gate of Xinxiao Street, patrol officers from the French Concession happened to be passing by on patrol. They immediately fired three shots into the air as a warning. As a result, one thief was apprehended, and a loaded pistol was seized. He was taken to the police station, where the police chief questioned him in detail and ordered him to be detained temporarily pending trial in court.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of the Fang and Hu Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Fang the Bandit Once Accused Detective Liang of Stealing Morphine</p>
<p>The Police Station Presented a Distribution List as Evidence</p>
<p>Chen Shifan, a native of Ningbo, was engaged in the construction and construction business. At 9:30 PM on December 19th of last year, he was riding in his own car when he was stopped by four kidnappers on Pingwang Street. Chen was taken away and hidden at No. 330 Ladou Road in the French Concession, where he was held for a ransom of 10,000 yuan. Chen bribed the guards with 5,000 gold to escape. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Old Gate Police Station apprehended the kidnappers, Lu Agen from Yangzhou and Zhou Yuying, a woman from Changshu. They were handed over to the Special District Court for sentencing. Lu was sentenced to death, and Xu was sentenced to 20 years in prison. During the court session, Lu Agen stated that Fang Liansheng and Hu Along were accomplices, but because he did not know their addresses, there was no way to investigate. Later, Fang suddenly used the alias Li Liansheng to accuse Liang Chengyu, a Chinese detective at the Inspector General's Office, of stealing more than 50,000 yuan worth of morphine. The police station filed a lawsuit against Detective Liang, and after the trial, Detective Liang was acquitted. At that time, Detective Liang pointed out that Li Liansheng was Fang Liansheng (nicknamed Xiaoliansheng), who was wanted but not caught. In addition to kidnapping Chen Shifan, he was also involved in the kidnapping of Li Huiqing. The police station detained Fang Liansheng. Subsequently, Hua Jin, the Chinese detective chief of the Hongkou Police Station, and detectives Mao Yiwen, Bao Shuji, Zhang Jinlong, Yang Zhaoqing, Liu Zhaonian, etc., apprehended Hu Along and brought him to the Special District Court for interrogation along with Fang Liansheng. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiexun held three consecutive preliminary hearings. Police station lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the two defendants, in addition to kidnapping Chen Shifan, also kidnapped Li Huiqing on Guangxi Road at 1:00 PM on February 8th of this year, obtaining a ransom of 2,000 yuan. They had confessed to this at the police station. Lu Agen, who had already been sentenced to death, testified that the two defendants were present during the kidnapping. A distribution list was found in Fang's house at No. 179 South Chengdu Road, stating that Fang received one share and Xu Yuying received one and a half shares. The list was presented as evidence. Chen Shifan then testified that it was raining heavily and it was very dark when he was kidnapped, so he could not identify the faces of the bandits. After arriving at the bandits' den, he bribed the guards with 5,000 yuan to escape. His driver, Shen Changfa, testified that he could not identify the two defendants. Li Huiqing had gone to Shantou and had not arrived. Judge Xiao interrogated the two defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>

He did not turn off the power and was electrocuted and fell to the ground as soon as he touched it. When the family learned of this, they turned off the power, but Liansheng was already breathless and unconscious. They immediately called Baolong Hospital in the Concession for a doctor to come and treat him, but it was ineffective. Jin Ertu, the head of the three wards in that area, heard the news and immediately went to Zhongxing Road to report the matter by letter to the branch office.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I read the [Appeal Trial of Drug Trafficking Case] in the local news section of your newspaper on July 16th. The first paragraph contains many factual errors. Upon investigation, the manager of the Jieji Company is the shop owner, Li Zhusan, who is also the husband of Yu Zhenxiang. Mr. Yu Zhenxiang is only an employee of the company, specializing in bookkeeping. How could he go out and carry packages? All external matters are managed by Li alone, and her husband has no right to interfere. On that day, the package was moved from the Changsheng Yarn Shop on Diandang Street to the cargo truck by the company's handyman, Li Hongru. On the way, the detectives suddenly arrested the person and seized the goods, and 42 packets of red pills were found in the package. Unexpectedly, the handyman Li Hongru falsely accused her husband of instructing him to do so. As a result, her husband was arrested and sentenced. The two owners of Changsheng and Jieji fled to avoid the situation, causing her husband to be wrongly implicated. Therefore, he has hired a lawyer to appeal according to the law and request a reversal. This is the true story of the case. Please publish this letter in your newspaper to correct the record. Thank you very much. Respectfully, Yu Yao Shi, July 17th, residing at No. 641 North Chengdu Road.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I have read the news in your newspaper's local news column on July 16th regarding the Health Bureau's intensified epidemic prevention work, and there are several inaccuracies. (1) Cholera outbreaks have occurred in India and other places, but leptomeningitis has not become an epidemic. (2) Regarding the dispatch of personnel to board foreign vessels for inspection before landing, it is planned to be jointly handled with the Harbor Epidemic Prevention Office, and it is not being carried out solely by the Municipal Health Bureau. (3) Mr. Zhong's position is not the head of the bureau's department. I am writing to you specifically to request that you investigate and correct the record. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, July 17th, to the Editorial Office of the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>To the Editor, According to my client, Mr. Ni Gongwei, the current general manager and resident manager in Hankou of the Sichuan Road Company, he stated in a letter from Beiping that he had read the news reports in the Shen Bao of July 3rd and July 8th regarding the recent communication from the Sichuan Road Shareholders' United Association, which contained many criticisms of the company that could confuse listeners. Upon investigation, the fellow villagers organized the Sichuan Road Shareholders' United Association, advocating for shareholders to hold meetings on their own and opposing everything. However, they do not realize that holding shareholder meetings requires raising a large sum of money. Even if the funds for the liquidation are stored in a secure bank, there must be a legal person responsible for them, which cannot be arbitrarily executed by a small group of shareholders in any one place. Otherwise, if shareholders in various places act independently, the result will still be a lack of funds for holding meetings and no one responsible, allowing those who borrow and embezzle funds to continue to celebrate having an excuse not to repay. In the past, whenever someone was appointed to handle the liquidation, those who borrowed and embezzled funds would secretly instigate their cronies or incite fellow villagers to obstruct and sabotage under the guise of shareholder groups. Although there are many pure and admirable people in the Sichuan Road Shareholders' United Association organized in Shanghai this time, they may not fully understand the actual situation of the company and the responsibilities that Mr. Ni Gongwei is currently bearing. Mr. Ni Gongwei was elected and appointed as the general manager and resident manager in Hankou with the consent of the majority of directors in the form of letters and telegrams, entrusted with the responsibility of holding meetings and liquidation. He also obtained the approval of the provincial government and dispatched Mr. Wang Zhai Shi to supervise the liquidation and prepare for the meeting. Since taking office, the company has not had a single fund to work with and has been running around borrowing money, tirelessly enduring complaints. He has accumulated and liquidated assets in Shanghai, Hankou, Pingjin, and other places to protect the company's rights. He has also submitted a request to the provincial government to approve the holding of a shareholders' meeting at the company's headquarters on October 21st of this year. He believes that his humble talents bear this important responsibility. He would be grateful if the majority of pure gentlemen in the Shareholders' United Association could provide legitimate guidance. Even if there are derelictions of duty, they can be questioned or sued according to the law. However, he does not want them to be used by others without knowing the inside story, making baseless accusations that harm his personal reputation and obstruct the liquidation and meeting affairs. Therefore, I respectfully request that you forward this letter to the Shen Xin and other newspapers to be disclosed in the "Letters to the Editor" column as a correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Yu Zhongluo, July 17th, to the Shen Bao.</p>

<h3>Study Abroad in Ceylon</h3>
<p>— Huang Maolin</p>
<p>I have been planning to study in Ceylon for several years. Last winter, I decided to go, and after three or four months of preparation and the support of various virtuous people, I was able to fulfill my wish and set sail on the 3rd of February of the 20th year, taking the Kashima Maru to Hong Kong. I arrived in Hong Kong after seven days and went home to visit my family, from whom I had been separated for eleven years. That evening, the ship went to Singapore, where the Buddhist Research Association had a beautiful new Buddhist hall with six Buddha statues made of marble from Italy, each worth about 4,000 Chinese silver dollars, which was very solemn. On the afternoon of the 18th, I arrived in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon. The Buddhist School sent a Sanskrit professor, Mr. Batte, to pick me up. Mr. Batte is a high-ranking Brahmin who has recently converted to Buddhism, a dignified scholar. The Maha Bodhi Society of this place also sent someone to the ship to welcome me with great enthusiasm. He had studied in the East and was an enthusiastic Buddhist. He had translated my [Overseas Buddhist News] published in the third issue of an English magazine into the local language and published it in the newspaper. After I landed, I went to the Buddhist School to visit the elder, who is proficient in Pali and Sanskrit and is famous for his morality and learning in this land, a kind and benevolent person. The school is located four or five miles from the city and has beautiful scenery. There are about 20 people living and studying here, including Indian monks and Nepalese monks. There are also laymen and monks who give lectures, dozens of people. The school is translated as [Mingzhen], the word [Ming] means [learning], such as [Five Ming Treasures] or [Solemn], the translated meaning is [Treasure of the School]. This school is one of the famous Buddhist colleges in this land with a long history. The previous governor of Ceylon, Mr. Zhan Ma, came here every day to study Pali and translated the English Madhyama Agama Sutra. After I met the elder, I went to the Buddhist hall to worship the Buddha. In this place, one cannot wear shoes or socks when worshiping the Buddha. The candles burned are white western candles, and the offerings are flowers. Incense may or may not be burned. The method of worship is different from that in China. One must walk around the pagoda three times and worship the Bodhi tree, walking around the tree three times. This is the usual practice of worshiping the Buddha.</p>
<p>Each temple has a pagoda and a tree. Before worshiping the Buddha and walking around, one must wash their face and be barefoot. Here, one gets up at 6:00 AM every day, takes a cold shower, and then worships the Buddha at 7:00 AM. At 8:00 AM, one has breakfast of white rice and curry. Classes start at 9:00 AM and lunch is at 11:30 AM, consisting of rice, curry, and vegetables. At 7:00 PM, one worships the Buddha, chants scriptures, and then prostrates to the elder to repent of the actions of the body, mouth, and mind of the day. The elder replies, [I am also like that.] Here, monks are highly respected, and it is taken very seriously. Laypeople cannot sit on an equal footing with monks. One does not return the prostration of monks. The diligence of the monks is also admirable and amazing. The Nepalese monk in the next room knows several languages, including English and Tibetan. He gets up at 5:00 AM every day and immediately reads the scriptures. The sound of his reading can still be heard at 10:00 PM. The Sanskrit professor teaches every day and studies German and French on his own. He will soon take the doctoral exam at a certain German university. His diligence is very rare. The chairman of this school is the Deputy Speaker of the Ceylon Parliament, who is proficient in Theravada Buddhism and has a master's degree in liberal arts from England, a charitable gentleman. Knowing that I had come here, he sent a letter from Shanghai welcoming me to study here. Unfortunately, when the letter arrived, I had already left Shanghai. On the night of February 19th, he personally came to the school to visit me, but I was staying at the Buddhist Youth Association because of some matters. He is the president of the Youth Association and visited me late at night, inviting me to have lunch at his house on Sunday. The expenses for my stay at the Youth Association for a few days were also paid by him, which is very touching.</p>
<p>On February 23rd, I took a car to Kandy to pay homage to the Buddha's tooth and visit several ancient temples, all guided by Mr. On March 1st, I returned to school. On March 5th, I started Pali class, and on the 7th, I started Sanskrit class. Here, the morning and evening classes are all in Pali and must be memorized. In addition, Sanskrit and Pali are very complex, especially difficult for beginners. Therefore, I cannot take care of Chinese translation and editing magazines until three or four months later.</p>
<h3>The Incomparable Courage of a Ten-Year-Old</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>After reading the article about the young girl who defeated the thieves and recovered everything (see the 10th issue of this publication), no one can help but admire the girl's extraordinary wisdom. Unexpectedly, another similar event occurred. Someone from Taizhou came to Shanghai and told me about a ten-year-old boy who defeated the thieves and recovered everything. She was a female, and this is a male. She used wisdom, and this one used courage, which is even more admirable. The fact that it happened in Taizhou makes it even more worthwhile to promote. The young boy's surname is Zhang. His family lives more than twenty miles from the city. His father is originally a tenant farmer, but he is quite wealthy because he has been diligent and frugal all his life, and he treats money as his life. Therefore, he has accumulated savings and become a well-off family. In recent years, Taizhou has also suffered from many thieves, and murders and robberies occur from time to time. The villages have all raised funds to defend themselves. When there is an alarm, they beat gongs to gather the people to resist the thieves, and the situation has improved slightly compared to before. One night, Mr. Zhang was chatting with his family when suddenly more than a dozen thieves broke into the house, each holding a handgun and flashlight, raging like a pack of tigers and wolves. Mr. Zhang did not have time to hide and was captured by the thieves, who tied his hands and pointed a handgun at his chest, forbidding him to make a sound. They did the same to Mrs. Zhang. Both husband and wife were terrified and looked like no one. The thieves then opened boxes and overturned chests, searching and looting wildly. They divided into groups and robbed neighboring households. In the end, only two thieves remained in Zhang's house, still searching and rummaging. When the thieves first entered the house and tied up Mr. and Mrs. Zhang, the young boy hid in the corner of the room and gradually crawled under the table. The thieves shone a flashlight on him and saw that he was a child and did not pay attention to him. The boy also kept silent. By this time, the thieves had almost forgotten about the boy under the table. The boy saw that there were only two thieves left. He quietly went to the corner of the room and took a door bolt. Taking advantage of the thieves crouching and searching and rummaging, he suddenly raised the bolt and slammed it hard on the head of one of the thieves. The thief was caught off guard and immediately fell to the ground. Another thief heard the noise and looked around in shock. The boy continued to raise the door bolt and struck him with force. Although he hit the thief's shoulder, he was not seriously injured. The thief angrily wanted to grab him, but the boy had already run out of the house. The thief chased after him but could not catch him. Soon after, they heard the loud sound of gongs being beaten. The villagers rushed to gather and shout, and the sound shook several miles. The two thieves in Zhang's house abandoned all the stolen goods and fled. The thief who had been hit on the head was still in terrible pain. At the same time, the thieves who were robbing neighboring houses were also panicked and only cared about escaping, not daring to take the stolen goods with them. The fact that the robbed households did not suffer any losses was all due to the efforts of the young boy alone. When he escaped from his house, he went to a house with a gong and obtained one. He beat it wildly to call for help. When the villagers heard the sound of the gong, hundreds of people gathered unexpectedly. Everyone was afraid that the thieves had weapons, so they shouted in unison to intimidate them. The thieves were indeed frightened and ran away, not being able to capture a single person.</p>

<h3>Rambles in Korea (8)</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The history of Chinese people living in the Korean Peninsula is long. The establishment of the Four Commanderies of Lelang, Imdun, Hyeondo, and Jinbeon by Zhou Feng Jizi in Korea during the Han Dynasty is sufficient to prove it. Geographically, Incheon in Korea is only separated from Shandong by a body of water, making transportation very convenient. Therefore, there are more Shandong people in Korea than people from other provinces. According to the latest survey, the total number of overseas Chinese is nearly 100,000, generally divided into three types of occupations: agriculture, industry, and commerce. Although they have lower knowledge, their virtues of diligence and hard work exceed those of the Japanese and Koreans. But for this reason, they are often envied and excluded by the Japanese and Koreans, and the voices of排斥華僑 are getting louder.</p>
<p>Whether Chinese businessmen in Korea are local merchants or urban merchants, when they start their businesses, they must reserve a portion of their property outside of the commercial capital. Sometimes, when the market is panicked or there is an unexpected loss, their lives will not be suddenly affected. At the beginning of their operations, they are often in small, remote alleys with small storefronts, and all transactions, such as bread, cotton cloth, groceries, and food, have been established for many years. Before long, a grand Chinese-style store is established. This is a common occurrence. The steps of their commercial development are from small to large, from near to far. On the basis of doing business, they are indeed more stable than Japanese and Korean businessmen. Otherwise, how can they survive in such an evil environment?</p>
<p>The number of overseas Chinese engaged in agriculture in the whole of Korea is estimated to be more than 14,000, mostly living in the suburbs of major cities. The most important thing for urban people every day is vegetables, and overseas Chinese farmers supply them as much as they need, which is their only way of life. In recent years, with the immigration of Japanese, the addition of railways, and the development of industry and commerce, Korean cities have seen a large concentration of population, and the demand for vegetables has increased day by day. The productivity of overseas Chinese farmers has also continued to grow. They are all strong and energetic, and their spirit of labor is by no means comparable to that of the Japanese and Korean people. They work in the fields, working at sunrise and resting at sunset, and the quality of the vegetables they grow is excellent. Even in Seoul, Incheon, and Pyongyang, most of the vegetable market is occupied by overseas Chinese farmers. In addition, they also use their spare time to engage in the sideline of raising pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks. Unfortunately, they have not received education, have little knowledge, and are easily deceived, especially by the Japanese.</p>
<p>The number of overseas Chinese workers in Korea is more than 30,000, including road construction workers, stone workers, carpenters, miners, sculptors, porters, barbers, and blacksmiths. They all have autonomous groups, which are so-called [gangs]. The main reason for their organization is the relationship between fellow villagers or the relationship between fellow workers. Although their language habits, knowledge, and skills are different, they are able to gain a foothold in Korea thanks to the [gang]. They mostly appoint one person as [leader], and under his command, dozens or hundreds of people are gathered to form an organization of a certain [gang]. After overseas Chinese workers join a [gang], not only must they obey the [leader]'s orders, but they must also strictly abide by the gang rules, and they cannot engage in the work of other gangs. The leader can represent the entire [gang] and conclude contracts with entrepreneurs or entrepreneurs' groups, so that the [gang] often has a monopoly victory. The result of their group training is that no one is not diligent and no one is not working hard, so they can excel over others. The reason is that overseas Chinese workers are able to work hard, are obedient, and can obtain the highest efficiency at the lowest cost, so entrepreneurs attach great importance to them. Some of the Japanese and Koreans are very jealous, while others want to take advantage of them, creating a contradictory phenomenon.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Storytelling</p>
<h3>？？？ (25)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>[To the left!]</p>
<p>Mrs. dislikes monotony the most. Seeing her husband stroke her by her side, she would order him to turn left. Sometimes she wants to walk alternately to the left and right, sometimes she wants to walk in a straight line, sometimes she wants to walk in a circle, sometimes she must walk in an ellipse. There are also times she requires her husband to count one, two, three, four, like doing gymnastics. There are also times when she is annoyed by calling the numbers too simple, and she wants Ziliang to sing a song [The Poor Autumn Fragrance]. In short, the changes are endless and must be ordered by her temporarily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the wife, whose liver was hurting, laughed loudly.</p>
<p>[Ticklish.]</p>
<p>She covered her chest with both hands and would not allow Ziliang to stroke her again and kept laughing. Ziliang stopped his hands, not knowing what was going on.</p>
<p>[Don't let you use your hands anymore!]</p>
<p>[Are you alright?]</p>
<p>Ziliang asked cautiously. The wife did not speak and continued to laugh wildly. Suddenly, she sat up.</p>
<p>[Thank you! Pour me a cup of tea to drink!]</p>
<p>[Is the liver pain better?]</p>
<p>Mrs. nodded. Ziliang went downstairs to pour a cup of hot tea and brought it to the front of the bed, seeing that his wife had already lain down again.</p>
<p>[The tea is here, get up and drink!]</p>
<p>[I don't want to drink!]</p>
<p>Ziliang felt very surprised.</p>
<p>[Are you feeling unwell again?]</p>
<p>[No!]</p>
<p>[If you don't want to drink tea, why did you ask me to pour it?]</p>
<p>Mrs. suddenly laughed again.</p>
<p>[This cup of tea is my treat for you!]</p>
<p>[Why?]</p>
<p>[You worked hard just now, so I'm treating you to a cup of tea!]</p>

<h3>Gold Specie Reaches New High</h3>
<p>Approaching the Fifty Tael Mark: Yesterday, the gold specie market turned from sluggish to firm, the situation becoming complex again, making progress and retreat uncertain. Fellow traders were of the mind that soft was better than firm. Looking back at the previous and subsequent market, there was a fifteen or sixteen tael swing. As a result, there was a dramatic thirteen tael surge. The silver market's slight increase was just beginning. The future holds untapped potential, while foreign exchange seemed to favor profits. Then, from 733 or 734 taels, it rose to 43 or 44 taels, with buyers being quick to act. Later in the market, it initially stabilized, but then foreign drafts became even tighter. Major players on the scene had already begun actively purchasing, leading to soaring prices approaching the 750 tael border. It is predicted that this morning, the silver market might decline.</p>
<p>Morning Opening Once Sagged: The market opened slightly lower by 1.8 mace in the early nine months, at 734 taels. However, compared to the after-hours trading the previous evening, it had still risen by over 1 tael. The large bars did not change, but the silver price increased by one-eighth. Private telegraphs were the same, suggesting that the exchange rate between the U.S. and England had returned high, so the Shanghai market's English gold should shrink. In addition, the buying side remained strong, immediately rising to 39.8 mace, while foreign drafts were flat. Banks trading English gold for August and September were at 31.25 to 3.75. Subsequently, Anda offered 31.25, and Bingxing, Shunli, and Wanxing in the trading pit sold, retreating to 35.5 mace. After that, it fluctuated by over 1 tael. When English gold opened, it was listed at 36.5 mace, with no change. Only the U.S. dollar increased by 1.25, and the Japanese yen decreased by half a cent. This was a foreign exchange transfer. At this time, the selling side was active, immediately dropping to 33.5 mace. Then, HSBC and Shanghai bought September at 3.75, and banks traded 31.25 to 3.75. At 9:30, it rose to 37 taels. After 10:00, it fell back over 2 taels to 34.8 or 34.9 mace due to retail sales. Then, Tongtaichang, Yu Da, Fuxingyong, Fuchang, and others followed up with purchases, and English and American banks bought 31.25 to 25. Thus, the gold price broke through 40 taels. Approaching 11:00, it was 42.5 taels. Suddenly, Zhifengyong and others came to buy, immediately depreciating by over 4 taels. At 11:15, it was 38 taels. Afterwards, Hengyu, Yongfeng, Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, and others agreed to compete for purchases. Moreover, English gold was offered at 25 in and out. Thus, it rose by 6 taels. After 11:30, it was 44 taels. The Indian exchange reported a small 1 or 2 annas, and Adamson was down 2 taels. At the noon close, it was 43.3 mace, and then it was adjusted to 3 or 4 mace. The listed price changed to 784.2 mace, a difference of 47 or 48 taels to 50 taels. The noon close was 41 taels.</p>
<p>Rise of Twelve Taels and Seven Mace: At the opening of the afternoon market, it was 42.5 taels, with more buyers seeming to exist. Moreover, the Indian exchange returned a small 1 anna, so it became 44.3 mace. Wanxing and others took to the market to sell. At 2:15, it was 41.5 taels. Banks traded this month's English gold at 25, and then sold at the same price in September and October. Suddenly, it was heard that HSBC was eating 25. Yuanmaoyong, Fuchang, and Yuantai all bought, becoming 45 taels. Before and after 2:30, there were two tael rises and falls. The trading was not strong. After 3:00, it gradually rose. Fuchang, Yongfeng, Xuchang, Hongxing, Yu Da, and others were all strongly purchasing, and it was rumored that the Indian exchange was reporting a small 2 or 3 annas. Thus, the gold price surged by 6 or 7 taels. At 3:30, it was 49 taels, but the Dalian gang tended to sell, immediately avoiding 3 taels to 46.2 mace. At 4:00, it rose again to 48 taels. Suddenly, it was suppressed to 46 taels, actually because the cashiers of each firm were divergent. After 4:15, HSBC ate another 1.875 English gold, especially because the bulls arbitrarily raised the price and booked it. Therefore, it was raised by over 2 taels again. At the 4:30 close, it was 48.5 taels, an increase of 12.7 mace compared to the 16th. Also, at 47.5, Wanxing, Shunli, Tongtaichang, and others all sold. Fortunately, Hengyu, Dadecheng, and others did not tire of buying, returning to 49 taels. It was indeed a restless, drifting situation. According to the data, the largest price of the day was 49 taels, and the smallest price was 33.5, a fluctuation of 15.5 taels.</p>
<p>Spot Bare Silver and Tianjin Demand Turn Weak: The early market price for goods was 23.5 mace, and the noon close was 43.3 mace. The afternoon 3:20 close was 47 taels, and the listed price was 41 or 42 taels to 35 or 36 taels. The account entries for July and August were 41 taels, September was 43 taels, and the afternoon was 47 to 49 taels. Replenishing water was 41 taels, and the afternoon was 47 taels. The sales of spot bare silver bars were not as strong as the previous day, because there was a sudden message from the Tianjin gang that they had stopped handling goods. Only a quantity of 1,000 taels was traded at a price of 11.75 taels above the gold specie price, sold by Yingfenghong.</p>
<p>Dalian Sell More, Buy Less: Also, the trading of various firms in the pit was still lively. Statistics show that Fuchang, Yongfeng, Yuanheng, Hengyu, Yuanxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Fuxingyong, Yu Da, and others all bought. Shunli, Wanxing, Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, and most others sold more and bought less. Speculators Wu's entries and exits were erratic. Bingxing and Yuantai also sold. Futaiheng, Yuanchun, Daxingyong, and Dadecheng had quite frequent entries and exits. In the afternoon, Yuantai, Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Cuichangyong, Yongfeng, Hengyu, Yuyu, Dadecheng, Daxingyong, Yu Da, and Xuchang all bought. Shunli, Wanxing, and Bingxing all sold. Qianchangxiang, Yuanxingyong, Futaiheng, Yikunyong, Tongtaichang, and others had very busy entries and exits. The Dalian gang sold a total of 5,000 bars and bought a total of 3,000 bars. The Guangdong gang's trading remained small.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Exceptionally Weak</p>
<p>The yarn market is once again weak, and the situation is softening. This is because there are many rumors about the current situation in the market. The Tianjin gang has a saying of stopping loading and stopping handling, and retail investors have been greatly hit. The market is rapidly trending downstream, while the overseas cotton yarn situation has risen in unison. Actual sales are still considered to be not bad, and the refusal of goods is still in progress.</p>
<p>Man-Made Standards Fall Back Down Two Some: The Shanghai Exchange's man-made standards opened in the previous market with American cotton rising, but the opening in the market fell instead. This is because the major investors sold, and each fell by one tael and four or five mace. The closing price recovered slightly, and as a result, it fell by one tael, one mace, five or six cents. In the afternoon, a part of the short covering rose slightly by three, five, six, or eight cents. The transaction was 55,400 bales. The sales show that Shenxin sold 1,200 bales, Heshen 1,500 bales, Gengfeng 4,600 bales, Tiancheng 1,500 bales, and Changfeng 2,250 bales.

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Cotton Prices Diverge</h3>
<p>American Cotton Turns Up, Market Air Relatively Firm: However, the local cotton market is still mediocre and without spirit. This is because the sunny weather has not damaged the new cotton very much, and the demand from the factories is greatly disappointed. Therefore, people's hearts are flat, and the market is trending down. However, the gold price is still tight and rising. Japanese East Cotton is safely not moving, and Old Cotton is relatively softer.</p>
<p>Han Standards Drop One and a Half Cents: The Exchange Han Standards opened in the previous market with American Cotton rising, but the yarn market was not strong, and the market atmosphere was still tired. The near falls by five cents to one and a half cents, and the far is flat. The afternoon slightly fell by five cents to one cent. The transaction was 41,000 dan. The sales show that Changfeng sold 4,200 dan, Yichang 1,800 dan, Yuchang 2,000 dan, and Yichang 1,200 dan. Gongtai bought 2,300 dan, Yufeng 2,400 dan, Shenji 1,600 dan, and Yuande 1,700 dan. The Han Standards closing price is recorded below.

<p>Actual Sales Completely Stagnant: Actual cotton has no intention to inquire at all. The arrival of Yao Cotton is counted at 500 bales.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Have a Great Improvement</h3>
<p>American Cotton Rises Due to Short Covering: Yesterday, American Cotton was tired at first due to good weather, and then strengthened due to political news favorable to the bulls and short covering. Futures rose by 26 to 30 points, and the spot rose by 25 points. British Cotton futures rose by 13 points, and the spot rose by one point. Egyptian Cotton spot did not move. Indian Cotton was first strengthened due to short covering and purchases by Japanese merchants, and then tired due to the weakness of the Liverpool market. Pingguol rose by 2 rupees, Aomula fell by one rupee, and Bairuoxi did not move. The original telegram is recorded below (16th telegram).

<p>Grain and Food 河下 Rice Market Steady</p>
<p>New Gate Yesterday, a total of twenty-four and five goods arrived on West Road. The Changxi and Erbang trades in this street are the best. Early and late rice guest gangs have a slight activity. The market improved. The Kunshan, Jiangyin, and other thick japonica rice sales are also not bad. The price per dan continues to be five cents lower. The price of Luyang tip rice is no up or down. The supply of Port Tip River is scarce. Only two tubes were sold in the same number of dans on that day. The momentum picked up by several points. The appetite for glutinous rice is scarce, presenting a downstream image. The river down dan feet are about two or three thousand dan.</p>
<p>South City The amount of road source is not much. Both urban and rural stores are easy to stay due to inventory, so select fresh material and slightly take the stomach. Those who stay are rarely inquired. The sale shows this image. Staying goods seem difficult to be determined, and they are all loose. Fresh and violent goods are tight due to lack, so the attitude of thick japonica rice is high and secondary soft, returning to the spinning state. Thin rice has not accumulated much. Both the 宁胃 appetite and the street sales are fresh and high. The market situation of medium and secondary rice is flat and steady. The arrival of Luyang tip is not much, and the appetite is also slack. The decline is due to the cheap price of white yuan, and the sale is more dull, so the price of fresh goods is temporarily determined. The arrival of Western rice is still lacking. There are only sporadic transactions in this street. The market shape is fixed and firm.</p>
<h3>Flour Tianjin Gang Actively Drawing and Loading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a near-stable and far-flat image. The reason for this is that the Tianjin area has seen a smooth spot sales in recent days, about 70,000 or 80,000. It is heard that a large batch of sales are 共軍 grain, so those who draw and load in the Tianjin gang are quite active. Fuxin also helps the prosperity of the guest gang and has also received advances, causing this month to step open and step firm. For expired months, the mills have hedgeouts, and buyers are not very brave, so the market is in a stable situation. Observing the later steps will be a spinning image, not too high a hope. As a result, this month is 7 mils better than the previous day, August is 5 mils better, September is 2 mils and a half better, October is 2 mils smaller, November did not move, and December is 5 mils smaller cloud.</p>
<h3>Spot Wheat Still Clogged</h3>
<p>Standards Should Be Lower</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market presented a flat and tired trend. Although the quoted price of 洋麦 foreign wheat rose back by 5 cents, most people's hearts are still difficult to shake because spot wheat is still clogged. Not only the inventory in this port cannot be sold through, but the inventory in other ports has become more and more overflowing since the new one was produced. The middle mills are all not moving. In this situation, people's hearts naturally feel uneasy, and those who throw goods at the standard feel that there are many people. Each mill is gradually declining due to poor morale. As a result, this month is 3 cents smaller than the previous day, August and September are 3 cents smaller, October is 1 cent smaller, November is 1 cent larger, and December did not move. The spot wheat market is still stable. The whole market opened with Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Dongtai, Chuzhou, and other more than 20 kinds of wheat. Fuxin handled 2,600 bales, Huafeng handled 1,400 bales, and Xiangxing handled 300 bales, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>European and American Silk Sales Lonely and Without Spirit</p>
<p>European and American markets are stagnant due to the German economic panic. Silk mills are not selling. Shanghai port electricity is not transferring. Yesterday, only Boxing advanced 6 packages of yellow silk and Xinfu advanced 5 packages of white silk. Meida advanced 10 packages of yellow rough silk. The prices are all flat and tired cloud.</p>
<h3>Needle-Eyebrow Green Tea French Sales Continue Smoothly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi and other roads in the Foreign firm tea market of this port, all started to handle business in 協新·同孚·福時·永興 and other firms. The market continued to trend smoothly, but the selling price fell by more than ten taels. The highest market price of Wuyuan Eastern 鄕貢熙茶 opened by 富林 Foreign Firm yesterday was 120 taels, which is the highest price in recent years, but the situation of ordinary goods is still difficult to be optimistic because the money shop has not yet opened. The Zhenmei market is still depressed. Transactions of upper and middle firm goods are scarce. Although the low-firm goods in Wenzhou and Yushan and other roads have a removal stomach, the inventory is no longer visible.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Glutinous Rice Branch New Goods Fail to Harvest</p>
<p>Old Goods One Hundred and Fifty Taels Did Not Form a Disk</p>
<p>Four boxes of Jinshan branches arrived at the Guangdong帮 firm on the previous day. Yesterday, the sample has been seen. It is not formally good goods. The opening price was immediately 48 taels. There are also more than ten boxes of Dachao branches opening at 43 taels. There are still seven boxes of Old Glutinous Rice branches, with the firm asking for 150 taels, but still not forming a disk. This year's new goods failed to harvest, and in the future, the ascension will inevitably be strange and high cloud.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Japanese Sugar Carved Market Plummets</p>
<p>Throwing Goods Dutch East India Opened Hundreds of Tons</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's producing area telegraph reported that the Cuban spot sugar price did not change. The New York futures sugar September price rose sharply from the previous telegraph. December and the next year's March also rose by 3 cents each. May only rose by 1 cent. Java spot sugar still lacks rises and falls. The public association's carved disk transactions in the market are particularly scarce, and the market atmosphere turned weak. Dutch sugar number 24 coarse sand white shouted a price of 11 taels 2 mace and a half, but it was seldom inquired about. Although there were slight transactions in the later market, the market shape was flat and stable. Medium sand and others were even less touched. Number 8 Dutch red 9 taels 3 mace had slight transactions, and the</p>

<h3>East-West Reflections</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Dr. Xie Shou Kang, the Chargé d'Affaires to Belgium, has a new book [East-West Reflections], most of which are lectures given by the doctor in Europe. It will be published soon. The foreword by the Belgian Foreign Minister Simon is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the indirect communication between China, Free Asia, and the former part (i.e. Turkey and Persia) and Rome, the West has always been surprised and admired. At the beginning of the 17th century, Marco Polo's records of Genghis Khan's guests aroused endless fantasies. Later, Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and mistakenly thought he was sailing to the east coast of Asia, and regarded Cuba as Cathay. As soon as he landed, he wrote to Genghis Khan. In the 18th century, the Westerner's love for exotism Exatisme changed the trend. Chinese exquisite magnetic strange lacquerware was widely sought after, and the decoration of the living room was also painted with Chinese figures and landscapes. Since then, the long history of the Chinese empire, the legacy of thousands of years, the ancient Shangde literature and art have been systematically studied, and the sudden changes in modern China have increased our interest and meaning. Therefore, we are delighted to welcome any works that can facilitate this still mysterious world. We are especially grateful to Dr. Xie Shou Kang, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of Nanjing Central University and Chargé d'Affaires of China to Belgium, for printing his speeches such as [China Ancient and Modern]. You graduated from the Paris School of Political Science and the Department of Sociology of Lausanne University with a Bachelor's degree, and a Doctor of Economics from Beijing University. You are well versed in Western literature and are a famous author of French tragedies. Your play [Sui Yu] was performed at the Royal Theatre in Belgium and achieved great success for a while. Mr. Xie's ability to make excellent Chinese elements communicate with the European intellectual circles is particularly appropriate. Mr. Xie is knowledgeable and connected politics through literature, so he is not only a politician and diplomat, but also a writer and scientist. Mr. Xie is able to realize his thoughts and actions equally, not as a poet who is angry with the world, but [as a non-dream sister in a world]. The materials in this book are completely contrary to other empty clichés and speeches without data. The text is concise and everywhere. See the truth. The topic begins with a general idea and then folds into details, and even the most subtle understanding. Under the pen of this learned master, reading the long history of China from the ancient emperor who invented medicine, architecture, and calligraphy to the pioneer Sun Yat-sen who strived to reform and create a new China, I feel happy and refreshed. Sun Yat-sen, in view of the past situation and to supplement the modern Anglo-Saxon constitution, adopted the oldest organization of the empire. In the past, the Chinese Censorate could punish officials, accuse high officials, and directly report to the emperor at any time. In addition, Chinese official positions were determined according to examination results. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen adopted our three powers of the civil system and added two inherent Chinese powers, namely the power of supervision and the power of examination. Mr. Xie stated that the five-power constitution of the Republic of China is the administration, legislation, justice, supervision, and examination. Simply put, this is nothing more than an allocation mechanism on the powers of Europe and the United States. Although the institutions are different, they are all subordinate to the national government. For example, the members of the Legislative Yuan, the Examination Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan are all appointed by the government. The work of this complex institution and the reform of a part of the current experience are enough for our detailed investigation. Mr. Xie also clearly explained Confucius' doctrine, which created China as a family with the emperor as the parent for centuries. After talking about calligraphy and literature, he briefly described the slow reform of Chinese literature until the restoration movement of this century. He detailed the history of the Liyuan opera school, which was founded in the Tang Dynasty in 720 AD, and the communication between modern national opera and European opera, which is more meaningful. This book also contains his speech on [Reflections on the Centennial Anniversary of Belgium], which proves his knowledge and understanding of Belgium, which is rare even in my slightly different neighboring country, and his admiration for Belgium is especially sincere. Therefore, in addition to admiring Dr. Xie's intelligence and knowledge, we also have sincere friendship. Dr. Xie's book helps us understand the concept of a very large nation that is now engaged in restoration. We deeply love the treasure house of its ancient culture and wish the future of this new republic is limitless. Here, we deeply know that the desire of the new China is to abolish the obstacles of the past 100 years and enjoy complete sovereignty like other countries. Looking back at the facts, it is enough to prove the goodwill between our two governments. The preliminary treaty of November 22, 1928 (to replace the treaty of 1865) announced that Western tariffs are equal to Belgian justice and recognized in principle the abandonment of consular jurisdiction. The contract on the remaining debt of the Gengzi Indemnity in 1927 used most of the funds for charitable causes and Sino-Belgian education. The agreement of August 31, 1929, for the implementation of this agreement, the Belgian concession in Tianjin was handed over to the Chinese authorities for takeover on January 15, 1931. An author who reveals the clear outline of his country and his fair opinions, and who possesses diplomatic art and literature, is not only beneficial to the ideological circles, but also to international harmony.</p>
<h3>Mongolia's Commerce</h3>
<p>— You Chen</p>
<p>Since the Mongolian Conference was held in Nanjing, many concrete proposals have been made for the construction of a new Mongolia with the Three People's Principles. Among them, there are detailed plans for transportation construction and industrial development. Now, a general description of the current state of Mongolian commerce is given.</p>
<p>Mongolia is a plateau with overlapping mountains located in the abdomen of Asia. Its area is roughly equivalent to the eighteen provinces of mainland China, but the population density is extremely sparse, with a total of no more than three million people. Mongolia is rich in natural products and is suitable for animal husbandry. Therefore, nineteen out of ten people are engaged in animal husbandry, and it is famous for producing various excellent furs. Most of the furs produced are transported to the United States, and the United States also exports various industrial manufactured products, such as car manufacturing, sugar, leather, etc. to Mongolia in exchange.</p>
<p>After the Revolution of 1911, there was turmoil in the country, and Mongolia took the opportunity to declare independence and build the so-called [Mongolian National Government]. Influenced by Soviet Russia, it was decided that all commerce must be absolutely managed by the government, and it was announced that there would be no restrictions, and all profits would belong to the people. Therefore, the government specially established a cooperative purchasing organization. All commodities imported into Mongolia without passing through this organization would not be protected by the government. In addition, all independent or privately operated imports must be taxed, and the price is also estimated by the cooperative organization. The Mongolian government mostly purchases goods directly, or the general machinery of the Mongolian Cooperative in Kulun handles the business. The cooperative purchasing staff are stationed in various countries, including Moscow, Harbin, and Tianjin as the three major branches. The distribution offices of Mongolian native products are stationed in Leipzig, Germany, and New York, USA.</p>
<p>It is found that there are two channels for Mongolia's trade. One passes through Zhangjiakou, the commercial center in the south, to Tianjin and the sea port. The other passes through Kulun, the center of Mongolia, to Soviet Russia, and from the Northwest Siberian Railway to Haishenwai sea port. In peacetime, it mostly goes from Kulun to the trade centers of Manchuria and Hailar, and then via the Middle East Railway to Harbin. From Mongolia to Soviet Russia, cars, camels, ox carts, merchant caravans, ships, and airplanes are mostly used to transport goods. Those from Zhangjiakou in the south only use cars. The north route can be tax-free, and the transportation cost is also lighter than the south route. The journey is also more stable than the south route. Because the south route has to pay more tariff taxes, and the journey is restless, with many bandits. When the goods are transported to Zhangjiakou, they are transported by train to Tianjin. Due to the extra tax and unsafe roads, merchants have no profit even if they raise the price. The north route transportation mostly uses cars or waterways in summer, and camels in winter. As for air passenger transport, it runs every two weeks throughout the year.</p>
<p>During the Sino-Russian War in the autumn of 1929, due to military relations on the Middle East Road, Mongolia's fur trade in Manchuria and Hailar suffered greatly. The southern transportation took the opportunity to be smooth, and Zhangjiakou also restored its status as a fur center. Zhangjiakou was originally an important commercial market inside and outside Mongolia. Since the Mongolian government established the central procurement agency, and because of the heavy taxes and protection fees, the southern commerce declined sharply and shifted to the north route to enter the sphere of influence of Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>The goods transported from Kulun to Haishenwai are mostly furs. The sales of this fur are mostly in the United States. At the same time, Mongolia's imports are mostly Russian gasoline and oils, European groceries, and German machinery. Although some of the industrial products shipped from the United States to Mongolia recently entered Mongolia from Manchuria and Hailar, most of them still take the road of Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>The industrial products shipped from the United States to Mongolia are mainly cargo trucks and private cars ranging from half a ton to one and a half tons. Regardless of the size of the car body, cargo transport or passenger transport is extremely crowded. After the cars arrive in Mongolia, the car bodies are mostly modified to facilitate cargo transport. A car that can accommodate seven passengers often seats up to twenty-five people, plus luggage, etc., for weeks-long trips. In addition, the United States also ships minerals, candies, wheat flour, and leather to Mongolia. According to statistics in 1936, there were more than 500 boxes of California-produced sugar transported from Tianjin to Kulun. The number of those transported from Harbin was also large. Leather is a raw material that is made into boots and shoes in Harbin and then imported into Mongolia, where the market is extremely large.</p>
<p>From the above, Mongolia is indeed an excellent place with natural resources. Unfortunately, the transportation with mainland China is obstructed, making commerce unable to prosper. Especially, the immature idea of the government managing commerce due to the Soviet Russian instigation of the Mongolian government is the hidden worry of Mongolian commerce. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, the domestic goods of mainland China cannot be transported to supply its needs, causing Manchuria and Mongolia to become the war tails of imperialism's surplus industrial products. This is extremely urgent to save.</p>
<h3>Explorer Ameng Zeng is Said to be Alive</h3>
<p>Russian Icebreaker to Explore the Arctic This Summer</p>
<p>Moscow News: The rumor that explorer Ameng Zeng is alive in the Arctic is quite shocking. It is reported that Russia has decided to send the icebreaker Maiyijin to the Arctic for exploration this summer. Nobire also plans to participate in the trip.</p>
<h3>Japan's Unemployed in March are Approximately 400,000</h3>
<p>Presenting the Highest Record at the End of September of the Previous Year</p>
<p>According to the survey by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs, the estimated number of unemployed persons in the country in March of this year was 396,828, presenting the highest record since September of the previous year, an increase of 45,239 from March of last year and an increase of 9,368 from February of this year. The unemployment rate was 5.79, an increase of 0.8 from March of last year and an increase of 0.18 from February of this year.</p>
<h3>The Ethnicity of Childless Divorcees</h3>
<p>The United States is Moving Towards This Path</p>
<p>Lewis, Secretary of the American Childhood Alliance, published an article in America's oldest religious publication [Churchman], saying that the United States will become a [nation of childless divorcees] and is moving towards this path. At present, the divorce rate in the United States is increasing daily, while the birth rate is falling daily. As a result, there are very few families in the country. This is a terrible phenomenon. In 1880, the ratio of children under the age of 15 to the national population was 38%, but it fell to 32% last year. The current birth rate is only half of what it was 50 years ago. Compared with 1880, the United States has lost almost 5 million children based on the rate in 1930. The reasons include new ideas, new living standards, and birth control methods, all of which are related to it. The delayed age of marriage is also a factor. Not long ago, women who were not married by the age of 21 sighed as [old maids]. Now it is not the case. They often marry at the age of 24 or 25, and there are even older ones.</p>
<h3>The International Geographical Congress will be Held in Paris</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Takes the Opportunity to Open a Exhibition on Human Geography</p>
<p>Paris News: The International Geographical Congress is scheduled to be held in Paris in mid-September of this year. The Japanese side plans to take the opportunity to open a exhibition on human geography to display Japan's population distribution map, the changes in villages, cities, walls, temples, shrines, etc., aerial photographs, and other ancient fifty-three times of scrolls, etc., in order to show the development of Japanese studies.</p>
<h3>China's Cotton Exports to Japan Decreased</h3>
<p>Approximately 200,000 Bales Reduced This Session</p>
<p>According to the survey by the Japan Cotton Traders Association, the total amount of cotton imported to Japan from various countries from September of last year to the end of June of this year was 3,076,503 bales of Chinese, Indian, American, Egyptian, and other cottons. The same period last year was 2,871,127 bales. Among them, Chinese cotton this session was 434,587 bales, and the previous session was 454,436 bales.</p>

<h3>Thunder</h3>
<p>— Yu Xi</p>
<p>Saturday night, everyone went home. Those left in the dormitory were just a few of us who didn't go out much. We bought two bottles of wine, added a few dishes, and bought some beef to eat on the balcony, enjoying the cool evening breeze.</p>
<p>The sky was covered with dark clouds, and lightning flashed all around the horizon. The distant sound of thunder could also be faintly heard, indicating that a heavy rain was coming soon. We went inside to eat.</p>
<p>As expected, the rain came, and it was heavy. It beat against the roof, the balcony, and the leaves. The huge sound was like a large waterfall cascading down from the top of a mountain. And there was thunder to add to the spectacle. At first, the thunder was far away, but now it was near us, and very low, as if it were circling right on our roof. However, heavy thunderstorms are common in summer. Besides sighing that there was a lot of rain this year, we didn't pay much attention to it, until a thunderclap blew out all the lights, plunging us into terror.</p>
<p>At that time, the room was completely dark, but the lightning outside shone through the windows almost without interruption, illuminating the room as bright as day, seeing the wine glasses and dishes on the table, seeing the quilts and palm fans on the beds, even illuminating the foreign books on the bookshelf and the few of us standing there with frightened and dazed faces. Looking out the window, the outside world was one of thunder and lightning, with thousands of fiery serpents swirling in the sky near us. The thunder was always running around us, as if nailed to our building, determined to destroy it.</p>
<p>Everyone was like on the front lines, seeing those shells about to fall on them, and they were all thinking of ways to escape. Some burrowed into their blankets, while others curled up in the corners of the bed, knowing that the lightning wouldn't be so coincidental as to hit our house, but seeing the lightning and hearing the sound, they couldn't suppress their fear...</p>
<p>"Haha, if we get electrocuted and the whole house is destroyed, even if we who live inside try to squeeze into the cracks in the floorboards, we won't be able to escape our doomed fate. Unless we escape the dormitory. Whoever wants to live, run!"</p>
<p>"Running away is like seeking death. The rain outside is so heavy, and getting wet makes you more likely to be struck by lightning..."</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Old Chen said urgently,</p>
<p>"Thank you, someone quickly close the window, glass can insulate electricity." No one except Old Jin was willing to take on this task. While closing the window, he craned his neck to look outside, saying, "That beautiful fire snake is leaping right at our eaves."</p>
<p>"Whoever is sitting on the iron bed, move to the floor. Iron beds easily conduct electricity." In fact, Old Xu's words already contained a joking tone, but Old Ge, who was said to be used to seeing bullets and shells, actually fell for it, making everyone laugh.</p>
<p>Gradually, we moved from a serious period to a playful one.</p>
<p>"Let's pray to God and ask him to save us."</p>
<p>"Oh heavens, I have never hit my parents."</p>
<p>"I have never bullied anyone born with eyes."</p>
<p>"I am loyal to my duty."</p>
<p>"Ah, ah, I have never thrown leftover rice grains into the urinal..."</p>
<p>Everyone prayed, but Old Jin was sipping wine and eating food in the dark. At that time, there was still a lot of food and wine left on the table. If he secretly ate it all by himself, wouldn't we be at a great disadvantage? So I shouted,</p>
<p>"Who's still drinking there at this time? How dare you? Wine easily conducts electricity!" Everyone laughed. Old Jin was a little embarrassed and also thought of a way to deal with us.</p>
<p>"At this time, everyone can't laugh. The God of Thunder will strike dead those who like to laugh." So, everyone spoke up and we all talked playfully, as if we had forgotten the terror of just now.</p>
<p>Slowly, the momentum of the thunderstorm diminished a little, and the lights came back on.</p>
<p>We seemed to have entered a safe period from a dangerous one. As soon as our minds were at ease, we thought of eating. Looking at the table, there was only a little bit left in the half-empty bottle of wine that was left over from just now. We still remembered that there were three packs of beef on the table, but now there wasn't a single piece left. The wine was undoubtedly eaten up by Old Jin. According to the investigation results, Old Ge hid under the covers and ate all the beef.</p>
<h3>Distress</h3>
<p>— De Ren</p>
<p>"Min has such good English and Chinese, he will definitely have a good position after graduation!" Mr. Yi said seriously, looking at the faces of many students under the podium who were listening with great interest.</p>
<p>The dismissal bell rang, and Mr. Yi left the classroom. Then, the students gathered to discuss what they should do after graduation.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and a class of students fortunately graduated. It has been three or four weeks now. During these three or four weeks, the graduates of course had to run around looking for places to solve their bread problem. But sadly, graduates come out year after year in large batches, but the places for them to work are not increasing in large batches. The graduates cannot find food to eat and have no way to think, so they have to return to their alma mater and ask the school authorities to think of a solution.</p>
<p>But sadly, it is not easy for these school authorities to barely hold on to their own places to solve their bread problems. Where do they have the spare time to manage the places for you graduates to solve your bread problems? Because it really seems like we are in a time of bread problem panic, and there are too many people who are rushing to find food as soon as they leave school.</p>
<p>After repeated requests from the students, the school authorities had no choice but to show a little mercy, and officially selected three or four of the more beautiful and active ones from among the many graduates to stay at the school to handle affairs. On the one hand, they were considered to have agreed to your requests, and on the other hand, they themselves also gained an advantage, because they could hire them with meager salaries. Anyway, they voluntarily asked to come, and they are recent graduates with insufficient experience, humble food seekers.</p>
<p>A few students with good memories saw that Min was not selected to handle affairs in the school and seized on Mr. Yi's saying, "Min has such good English and Chinese, he will definitely have a good position after graduation," and asked Mr. Yi. Mr. Yi kindly deflected the reply. In fact, these students who asked Mr. Yi were too ignorant. How could they be so rude as to not understand the original intention of Mr. Yi's words? If they thought carefully, they could immediately understand that Mr. Yi's words were meant to make the students study diligently, and that he himself was not responsible for saying these words.</p>
<p>As a result, the school still used those few beautiful and active ones. The other students, even the one Mr. Yi had said "will have a good position," were still not selected. They withdrew from the school and had no choice but to sit at home listlessly, bitterly resenting the difficulty of finding food to eat in society.</p>
<h3>Youth Garden Guidelines</h3>
<p>(1) The text should be related to discussions of youth issues, domestic and foreign school or student news, essays, descriptions of school life, notes, etc. The style is not limited.</p>
<p>(2) Pictures should be limited to those related to youth issues.</p>
<p>(3) Photos of youth life (such as sports, travel, travelogues, drama performances, lectures, gatherings, exhibitions, various competitions, etc.), school news, and youth movements are eligible, regardless of whether they are individuals or groups. Do not write on both sides of the manuscript paper.</p>
<p>(5) Write manuscripts horizontally and do not write sloppily. Western text should be omitted where possible. If it is unavoidable to cite the original text, it must be attached below the translation.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the submitted manuscripts are published or not, they will not be returned. If they need to be returned,</p>
