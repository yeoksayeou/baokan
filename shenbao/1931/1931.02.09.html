<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本議會中之暴亂行爲</h3>
<p>猶憶中國以前在北平國會中。議員因開會而爭鬥。人咸以爲中國議員之程度不足。故有此醜象之暴露。余乃以爲所謂人者。其相去不甚相遠也。當其百事順遂。雍雍一堂。自現高尚之人格。及其相爭旣烈至乎非勝不可之際。則凡人類能力所能爲之事。將亦無所不爲。故今日中國議員之醜。態世人認爲詫怪者。他日文明各國之議員。且將奉之爲師。而一一步其後塵。或更况而愈下。並有爲中國不能演之醜態者。今日本議會中之毆鬥。筆墨器具横飛。用作武器。是與中國議員之情形同。更有以小刀傷人。流血不已。則更視中國議員而上之矣。</p>
<p>不但議會後進國之日本有此現狀。待之他日。一旦而歐美議會之先進國中。兩黨各呈必勝之决心時。其情狀亦必如今日日本之議會無疑也。且不但議會一端中國因歷年内亂之故。匪盜騷然。不可或止。世人認爲人民程度幼穉而訕笑然長此世界之商業不振經濟蕭條。則今日之所謂文明法治國者。一旦内亂起而失其控制。其國中匪盜之騷亂。亦必無異於中國而或過之。此又可斷言也。何也。世之所謂人者。至窮極無聊之時。其所作爲。固不甚相遠也。</p>

<h3>曁南足球眞茹籃球隊征菲記（八）</h3>
<p>（本報記者文初於一月二十八日寄自馬尼拉）</p>
<p>籃球敗於明星　▲六五對三一慘敗　丨第五次比賽丨</p>
<p>一月二十七日下午八時爲眞茹籃球隊、第五次作戰、其敵方爲全非明星隊、結果爲六十五對三十一、敗於敵軍、兹述其作戰情形如左</p>
<p>▲所謂全菲明星隊</p>
<p>即以出席第九屆遠東運動會、諸籃球隊員爲基本、并挑選各校健將、合組成軍、其戰鬥力之强、自不待問、</p>
<p>▲初戰時略占上風</p>
<p>銀笛聲起、兩方盡力攻守、球忽東忽西、爲敵方中鋒奪去、從右遠射、未能中的、再被敵方左鋒跳高接住、孔廣益上前欲奪、被其閃開、即轉身投籃、佈告牌上遂大書明星隊得二分、移時敵方左鋒、因推魏海青犯規由魏罰球、兩試兩中、乃以二與二平分春色、未護遂成六對五之佔上風</p>
<p>▲敵方進逼逞兇强</p>
<p>敵方右鋒連進兩球我方要求停戰、以楊麟敏代蔡榮瑞菲中鋒又投進一球其左衛犯規、由楊主罰、兩擲一中、斯時分數爲七對十一、敵方左衛又犯規、魏兩擲皆中、乘此時機、我軍竭力奮鬥無如敵軍前鋒與後衛、活動非常、遠投近射、無不命中、被其連進八球後、始由楊麟射中一球、魏得張其英之傳、亦進一球、成爲二十七對十二之比、至是敵方又大顯神通前鋒傳遞得法、莫不手到成功、分數屢差屢遠、由二十七對十二、突進爲三十八對十二、魏得罰球之便、兩投又祗一中、而敵方左鋒、又進一球、至上半塲將完時、張其英從左邊十五碼、遥射一球、入籃命中、最有精采、大足以鼓動士氣、無如上半塲之笛聲鳴矣、其分數敵方得四十、我方得十五、　　▲奮鬥中不甘示弱</p>
<p>易地再戰、雙方重整軍容、敵方再調生力軍加入、其目的在以一百分紀録、大挫我軍、幸我軍稍變戰略、用以柔克剛、冀挽危局、故表演較上半場爲佳、蔡榮瑞乘敵犯規、一試不中、再奮前一擊、球遂入籃、爲後半場開新紀録、而敵左鋒即時還擊、亦進一球其後激戰甚爲猛烈、我軍固時時在挣扎奮鬥中、不甘示弱、至六一對廿九時、敵方再調生力軍、以厚實力、黄老將得魏文長之合作、從遠方射中一球、爲我方最後之彩聲、而敵方亦於將完場時、打進一球、以作回敬、其結束敵方以六十五對三十、一戰勝我方、觀今夜比賽、我方傳遞比前略有進步、然敵方之　敏迅速、與投射確準、實爲我方所不能及、加以孤軍作戰、疲傷困苦、亦爲致敗之大原因也、</p>

<h3>紗花　上週紗花飛漲的經過</h3>
<p>▲出户絶跡…買聲沸騰</p>
<p>▲人標漲五兩有奇　棉紗在上週初市勢疲軟</p>
<p>而跌、因有一廠商將多頭了結而跌、未幾海外花紗狀况穩固匯兌奇縮、以致外棉合銀盤大漲、印棉難以進口、於是原棉發生激烈漲風、人心引動、散空均現驚惶失措、而多數買方心理、以百物騰貴、對於棉紗做多心思愈濃、加之某實業家亦吸收包額殊巨、故拉力甚强、但現紗銷路益覺岑寂、因結賬期近、各方預備收束生意、因此停滯、惟據一部份云、日廠有直接裝往南洋等處銷售、不經過市塲、詳細數置、須看海關報告爲准、此種激烈之漲風、完全受匯兌影響及棉花狂漲所致、查標紗各月價比上週漲五兩以外、全週成交統計二十六萬四千三百包、客帮買去現紗統計祇有二千二百九十包、同行中進三百四十包、週末市塲上流言孔多、謂某兩大户花紗空額占多數、因價格連日暴漲、有不穩之說、於是買户愈衆、勢如蜂擁而來、所以市盤愈趨愈高、</p>
<p>所中當局視漲風迅速爲免危險起見、對於　　兩方、增加特别現金六兩、然仍難減殺漲　也、據一部份云、豋記棉紗約有十三·四·萬包之巨、目前大勢狀况論之、難以觀疲、不過實銷不暢、漲勢未免太速、遠期已見一百七十兩、前途若何、殊難逆料也、兹將各帮已買去之包額、分誌於後、</p>

<h3>新疆客談　履冰</h3>
<p>余友茅君。向在西北諸省。從事貿易。近以時局稍定。遠道回南。訪晤之頃。述及新疆現狀。間有未經人道者。因記之。想亦讀者所樂聞乎。</p>
<p>新疆一省。號稱有兵十餘萬。實際上大半均屬土著。兵各有家室。各有田畝。平時操習之餘。多從事耕植。有事之際。父不妨另遣其子。兄亦不妨另遣其弟。彼中人稱之爲補額。不過平民多數能實地射擊。故補一兵額。視爲添一口糧。營中生涯。亦無畏縮不前之態。</p>
<p>軍隊編制。近年雖有改良。然未盡脫前代防營之法。自督軍楊增新蒞治以來。營長以上各員。利用漢回牽制。使不易變亂。譬如隊長用土著者。營長或用回人。連長用漢人者。連附或用阿富汗人。因彼輩非出同族。不易同謀。反叛之謀。於焉减少。惟外來勢力。時趨澎漲。果使邊圉告警。新疆一隅之兵力。殊未足以禦外侮也。</p>
<p>錢幣之在新疆。或用俄票。或用羗帖。至不一律。惟漢人在該地貿易。欲匯寄欵項。手續至繁。且亦不易。若帶現銀出口。超過五十元額。更處處加以留難。漢人之出省者。先須聲述緣由。請領護照。迨時逾數月。護照領得。每抵一地。尚須經過嚴密之盤查。稍有不合。動遭扣留。而所携錢幣。更難免没歸公有故陜甘魯豫之民。一入新疆。往往終身卜居。不復歸來。殆亦感覺沿途之不便耳。</p>
<h3>命相生肖說　費·文·寶</h3>
<p>吳經熊先生。精邃法律之外。更喜研究命相之學。曩於筵次晤立法院統計處長劉大鈞先生。謂其形貌肖兎。年必四十。詢之果然。客歲出國前。偶推賤造。囑今冬須防破財。結果余以意外損失。耗銀千兩。按吳君行年三十三。生肖屬豬。而其本人則翩翩白晳。絶無痴肥黑蠢之態。又嘗爲老同學周君論相。謂其有寡人之疾。實則周君素以道學先生聞於世。殆命相生肖之說。亦有騐有不騐者矣。（却酬）</p>
<p>自北平寄遞函件。至速亦逾匝月。大抵交通方面。取道俄境者較捷。若由甘肅經旱道則較遲。新疆當局。對於隣省寄來之信。檢查稍弛。若來自南方者。率在到達之後。逾四五日始送來。蓋須經過開拆之手續。並加以詳細之檢查也。至報紙雜誌。十九都被扣留。因此該處人民。對於國内情形。甚爲隔膜云。</p>

<h3>巴黎物語（二七）六曾寄於巴黎</h3>
<p>特特爾蒙廢墟現在歸併在克吕尼古物館内。算做了克吕尼古物館的一個小小的庭園。凡想　要參觀特爾蒙廢墟的須由克吕尼古物館内進去。現在因爲說到了特爾蒙廢墟。因就便說說克吕尼古物館。</p>
<p>克吕尼古物館的正門開在蘇梅　街euedusommerardo就在巴黎大學對面。這房子的本身就和裡面陳列的古物一樣古。這是十四世紀初頭留下的建築。精雅堅實。在法國建築史上是狠有名的。裡面陳列的古物以歐洲中世紀及文藝復興時代的東西爲多。有許多大理石。黄楊木及象牙等的精細彫刻。貴重無比。另外還有許多寶石。銀器及法蘭磁的小件。也都是外面不易見到的。其他如各種金屬及木材作的用具。陶器及玻璃。地氈花邊及各種織品。各種兵器以及古時君主用過的遺物等。種類繁多。共二萬餘件。分貯樓上下三十餘室。收藏之富。使人歎觀止焉。　　克吕尼古物館内有兩件東西最值得我們注意的便是十字軍時代歐洲男子負戟東征時。恐怕自已的女人在家不貞。加在他們女人下身的兩種貞操帶。一種爲有錢人用的。鋼製。彫鏤甚精。可以將下身前後兩部完全鎖住。僅留小孔以通大小便。一種爲普通人用的。較粗陋。只能鎖住女子下身之前部。這種貞操帶可以說是一種極無人道侮辱女子人格至於極點的東西。六七百年前歐洲人的野蠻單單由這殘酷的貞操帶的製作上便可想見。遊巴黎的人可千萬不要錯過機會。到克吕尼古物館去見識見識。</p>
<p>作品。便讚不絶口。聞渡邊曾携孟容畫幅至東瀛。大爲彼邦法家所歎賞。日本近頗重花鳥畫。孟容蓋亦雅擅花鳥者也。</p>
<h3>六齡童諫父記　松廬</h3>
<p>餐霞生旣與青蓮女土暱。遂挾其所歡。漫遊蘇錫揚鎭諸名勝。已歷半載。曾一度遄返其原籍雲間。兩過家門而不入。妻沈氏。鴛鴦湖畔産。詩文雙絶。温和知禮。蓋裔出名門。一舊禮敎下之好女子也。旣悉其夫之别有所歡也。不妬亦不怒。惟自撫其六歲幼子。日以女紅所得。相依爲活。子名牛兒。頗聰頴。就讀於某私塾。竟不以無父贍養而輟學。氏或戲謂之曰。兒父不歸。母亦將抛兒而去矣。兒其奈何。牛兒泣曰。是固知阿娘之哄我也。然有父若此。誠不如無。雖然。阿娘勿恐父其終身不歸也則已。歸則兒必不令其再出也。母聞言。展顔微笑。於是母子益相安。竟忘其夫之棄已矣。一日。生忽歸。衣冠盡敝。見婦。輒相詬誶。旣而翻箱倒篋。檢視一過。見田單房契。完全無缺。心竊疑妻之怡適。初不知其數月來如何</p>
<p>中。匆匆欲去。婦乃挽其臂而告之曰。夫乎。何不情之甚耶。君棄妾誠不足惜。獨不念及君之可愛之幼子乎。夫聞言。殊不耐。奮臂疾行。牛兒見狀。忽以兩手阻門。泫然而泣。繼復跪地而言曰。父其棄我矣。我何生爲。父果欲行者。當先看我躍井以死。言訖。逕攀門前井欄欲下。生大恐。急抱持之。温語有加。牛兒悽然曰。父果猶知愛兒者。請勿再出。否則兒有父不若無父。父有兒不若無兒。兒必以死相諫也。生聞言。心果大動。遂允之。今已家居匝月。態度頓易。對於閨房之中。情好逾於新婚。有時得其戀人青蓮女士之柬招。則一一撕去之。以示决絶。此事爲文友臥雲生告余者。臥雲與餐霞有姻婭親。所言當不虚也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三六七）　　包天笑</h3>
<p>第十七回　駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉　續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>那天晚上。花老六預備理理箱子。叫一個小大姐阿寳。帮帮忙。搬出幾隻箱子來。開了箱子蓋。老六只是横點頭。覺得那種衣服。都好像是落伍的人物了。小阿寳是動於好奇心。見了那種五顔六色的衣服。早已驚歎不止了。花老六叫伊一件件的搬出來。小阿寳道。六小姐。這一件樣子很時式。你要帶了去吧。花元春摇摇頭道。你看袖子和筆管一般。怎麽再好穿呢。小阿寳又拿出　件。問道。這件呢。花元春又摇頭道。這一件好像還是乾隆年間的咧。不帶不帶。那時銅牀上。沙發上。椅子上。都擺滿了衣服。但是由花老六的眼光看去。簡直是一件也要不得。伊滿意是此番到北京去。在上海應該做幾件衣服去。無奈做衣服的錢。不曾籌到。好在伊的衣服本來也不少。可以將就過去。正在那個時候。有個小姊妹來望伊了。走進伊的房間裏。見一天世界都是衣裳。笑着說道。老六。你做什麽。預備開衣莊店嗎。花元春歎口氣道。我再有兩天就要動身了。這一回去了。也不知道幾時回來。我想多帶幾件衣服去。誰知打開箱子來看看。没有一件衣服可帶的。眞氣死人。那位小姊妹道。現在北京的南邊裁縫也很多。做的衣服也很不差。不過工錢略貴一些罷了。再說。你也去不長遠的。至多一兩節工夫。就要回來的。花老六賭氣道。都是爲了幾個斷命銅錢。逼得我離開上海。好便好。不好時。我便死在北京。不再回來。那個小姊妹便道。不要這般說。牙齒風是毒的。花元春道。眞的。要是到了北京。再弄不好。我也不回到南邊來了。這位小姊妹。勸了伊一番。又約定了明天在一品香吃大菜。給伊送行。談了一回自去。花元春便命小阿寳。到樓下喊一個自已的相帮上來。把箱子裏搬出來的衣服。用兩條大被單。打了兩個大包。明天一清早。送到典當裏去。出空兩隻箱子。把伊所需要的心愛的東西裝進去。什麽十幾塊錢一瓶的香水咧。各種各式花樣的瓶子。恐怕打碎。用棉花包好。再用舊申報紙四面塞住。比了玩古磁的骨董家。保護他的磁器。還要周密。再有是向吃素人那裏。定做了二十雙鞋子。櫻白的。蜜黄的。鸚哥緑的。玫瑰紫的。西湖色的。藕合色的。繡上了金魚的。燕子的。鴛鴦的。蝴蝶的。可謂無奇不有。恐怕碰壞丁鞋子的樣式。都要連匣子擺在箱子裏。</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>法將福煦　歐戰日記　顧昂若譯</h3>
<p>在一八七○年、我們的軍隊戀着守勢戰、並且是無抵抗的守勢、因之失敗了、在一九一四年、我們的軍隊因受專心致志於攻勢戰而不知隨機應變的影響、遇着許多無益的遏制和殘酷的傷亡、所主要的實在是每回對攻守各方面的利弊須透澈的研究、然後决定攻守的可能、强有力的攻勢慣常産生於聰明的連用兩種方法、交戰的軍隊數目增加了這種攻守戰略的聯合亦更必要、</p>
<p>我們的軍官在盡心研究攻勢戰的幾年裏、實在是興奮到極點、自信攻勢戰最值得重視、却忘記了近世砲火戰的非常力旦、他們對於軍備太不注意、因此就發生我們的步兵隊裏所配置的機關槍少於德軍的事實、</p>
<p>我們的軍團只有七五耗口徑的大砲一百二十尊、德軍團、雖則步兵較弱、有大砲一百六十尊、許多是一五○耗和一○五耗榴彈砲、我們軍隊裏的砲兵在數目上和砲口徑上同樣的不及德軍、我們精銳的步兵雖則有種種的優點、尤及在進攻的時候、却抵不上砲兵數目和砲口的缺點、更且不適於高角度砲火、守的時候、掩護的砲火分裂了敵人的頑强的攻轚、却能給我們以極大的利益、不過要有利的發揮這些戰略、我們的大砲應當有巨量的軍火接濟、不幸每尊只有一千五百發、彈子的製造尚没有準備到充分的規模、</p>
<p>空軍方面、和戰地電話電報方面、我們是顯着的不足、漢包特君在一九一四年夏天的演說、引起全國注意這些危險不過太遲了一點、改進來不及、反以寳貴的情報資送適人、</p>
<p>實際上我們的政府完全决定採用和平政策、並且很不覺得有必須保護國家的可能、所以許多年拒絶醵籌戰費、因此我們在近世戰爭裏軍備日見重要上缺乏那些要成功的維持戰鬭的物質的工具　　這是我們以攻勢戰爲不變的方式在實行上定要遇着嚴重的困難的另一原因、政治與戰事的指揮關係如此密切、可以說後者是前者的繼續、無論他如何熱心、無論他如何切望、想由勇猛的攻勢戰的唯一的途徑取得勝利、處於戰時一國軍隊首領地位的人、爲政治所造成的形勢所左右、常常不得不於開戰的時候採取守勢、</p>
<p>我們有一頭等的參謀本部可以抵補我們學理上的弱點、參謀本部的軍官對於他們的工作都是澈底的明瞭、還有幾個有過人的智力、陸軍大學和高等軍事學院發展了我們軍官的工作慾、同時訓練了開擴了他們的才幹、有天材的拿他們在這些學校裏所學得的所進益的發揮出來、在戰爭時期他們敏疾的迎合了無論什樣新頴的環境、建立了豐功烈業、</p>
<p>不過他們大多數是青年、心理上尚未成熟、所以他們不得不有人率領和指導、就是說他們缺乏足以發展判斷力的經騐和給軍官以鎭定的自信力的權威的習慣、鎭定的自信力足以産生聰明的有力的决策</p>
<p>就一切情形論、從最初開始時期起、徵發和動員的動作、軍隊和軍需的運輸、以及戰區後方繁重的工作、統統要十分準確的實行、</p>
<p>戰事爆發的時候、我統帶着第二十軍團駐紥在朗寒地方、那處的居民同魯倫地方的一樣的表示特别高漲的愛國熱度、當時的法國人個個受着愛國心的激勵、在四十多年裡、他們的手臂已伸過邊境去搶米慈地方、並且伸到已失的魯倫地方的弟兄們了、現在他們自問是否有一天他們的命運可以再混合着、</p>
<p>第一次芒　戰　（戰爭發生之初的）幾星期、在魯倫的瑪亨初戰裏、福煦正帶着第二十軍團、在一九一四年八月二十八日奉召到霞飛的司令部、他到的時候恰好總司令正在策劃着如何及何時反攻追擊的德軍、並且阻止他們自來勝利的直向巴黎進攻、福煦聽得了聯軍只樣的退却、雖則大爲驚駭、後來覺得霞飛的左右並没混亂或驚惶、心纔安定、霞飛立即委他帶領支隊、後來就是法國的第九軍、</p>
<p>（他的參謀長是魏根上校、他現在是法國軍事組織的首領、在戰爭期内始終與福煦在一起、還有一個副將就是後來做法國内閣總理的泰狄安君、新編第九軍在霞飛發出九月五日有名的攻轚令一九一四年九月六日就發生着名的第一次芒之戰的時候、已經編制完成、在這次全部大戰裏第九軍打得十分勇敢、</p>
<p>（福煦這一期的日記叙述這次歷史的戰事範圍比較的褊狹、他所記的是他自已的事績、並不是全部戰爭的歷史、第九軍的戰蹟他都詳詳細細的記下、但是到了他的日記的末了、顯見得他在一個軍隊的有限止的優越的地位上研究戰事全局的大問題了、</p>
<p>（第九軍的工作是固守法國第四軍與第五軍間之防綫、以及待命追敵、在九月九日、已與霍梧生將軍所指揮的德國第三軍惡戰了三日、第九軍覺得戰局漸漸確定有利於聯軍、敵人開始倉皇退却、其時福煦向他的部隊下了好幾道激勵的命令、）</p>
<p>過了幾天、我更加熟悉了我的軍隊、他們在比利士打仗的時候、我没有同他們在一起、但是我現在開始了解這嚴厲的經騐給他們的印象、</p>
<p>第九軍團的摩洛加師（漢包特將軍）已經惡戰了好幾天、受了重大損失、該師的精神仍佳、不過急須援兵、該軍團第十七師（蓋拿包特將軍）尚未經過劇烈的戰鬭、</p>
<p>第十一軍團所受的嚴酷的磨難、尤其在邁以遜地方所受的、在兵卒方面留下了痕跡、軍官死亡的甚多、尤其是不列登幾團的兵卒常常的請求再派遣軍官去率領他們迎敵、</p>
<p>第四十二師秩序最好、該師不過新近開到、指揮得亦很好、尚未經過重大的犧牲、幾個後備師開到了立刻就加入火綫、接戰了幾天、給他們極大的打擊、他們許多軍官没有經騐、年齡又太老、因此那幾師的兵士尚須鼓勵、他們的軍官尚須新的血氣、</p>
<p>我們這幾天有秩序的退却、不但使我們能夠避免敵人的追擊、且可以重整紀律和恢復秩序、援軍的開到並且使我們能夠重新整理重新編制後備師的隊伍、庆樣又使他們離開了前綫的興奮、我們的陣線現在逐漸的鞏固的立定了、左右兩面已與第五第四軍有了聯絡、其結果就是戰略形勢上得了極大的進步、因此産生了自信的心理、</p>
<p>打仗的夜間没有睡眠的嚴酷和行軍疲憊緊張了退却中免不了的沮喪、因之全軍都陷於嚴重的疲勞狀態中、不過已經可以預言的是再有幾天的休息和改編、軍隊就可準備開回前線擊敵、並且可望有取勝的機會、然而九月二日或九月二日前後再行總攻的希望、一時似乎可以實現、現在顯明的要放棄了、</p>
<p>這就是九月開頭時候的情形（未完）</p>

<h3>痛哭流涕　難言</h3>
<p>復旦考試場中一幕悲劇</p>
<p>青年男女最先須踏過的是「讀書」階段、其次才能跑上什麽求偶階段、擇業階段等等、現在的讀書、自已是不能讀的、一定要跨進所謂學府之門、賴敎師指導、同學攻錯、才能得到良好的效果、其實不然、現在一般青年的進學校、並不在乎讀書、不過企圖一個高貴的頭銜而已、因爲在現代一般人的眼光中、對於資格是非常重視的、所謂資格、即是代表這人學識深淺的一種標記、譬如他的資格是中學卒業、那麽、他的學識祇有普通的程度、他的資格是大學卒業、他的學識當然是有專門的程度了、在現社會上任事、也視這資格的高低而給予相適的地位的、所以、「升學考試」已成爲青年男女本身成敗的關鍵了、</p>
<p>這次復旦大學招考新生、應試的人是非常踴躍、但女同學却是寥寥無幾、所以很引起一般在校同學的注目、鼎鼎大名的芬女士、就是最露頭角的一個、本來芬女士在復旦已經讀過一學期、不過她是新聞學系的特别生、依照復旦的新訂的章程、凡特别生成績總平均在八十五分以上者亦須經過新生入學試騐始能爲正式生、不得免考或一部份免考、所以芬女士也祗遵守這新訂章程而應試了、她投考新聞學系、其原因當然很簡單、爲了交際手腕高妙、表演新劇的女主角、得到了一點虚評、實際、像這樣的一個女新聞記者、在中國却也非常的需要、她底眞實才能却不必說、在現社會最流行的小報上、關於芬女士的消息是特别多、有許多實有碍她底名譽和德性的、照她自已對人說、小報上揭載她的種種消息是没有一些屬於正確的、無非是那些無爲的青年和她胡纒、惡意地在造謡誘衆、因爲她在校讀書的時候、時常接到男同學給她的所謂情書、她爲了種種原因是不能允許他們的要求、而且關於這種來信、不但没有婉言向他們表示拒絶、簡直没有隻字回復他們、因此、就遭了他們的顧忌、任意在各種小報上攻轚、破壞、這或許是近於事實、不過爲了這些波折、芬女士曾在現在社會發表過一篇關於她底愛的施予的文字、其大意、是有非戲劇學者牧牛先生不嫁、</p>
<p>芬女士爲了投考復旦、也極費苦心、這次牧牛先生參加某劇社直首都表演、芬女士並不隨從、因爲考學校比較重要、這是切身的關鍵、當然不能忽視、這觀念在芬女士的腦海中是非常正確的、不像一般所謂摩登女子、祗要找到適當的配偶、誰還高興來讀書呢、和愛人通情書、乘汽車、吃大菜、看電影、跳舞是多麽寫意的事、眞的、享受愛人的福、還克苦地讀什麽書、讀了書又有什麽用、她底腦海中顯現着讀書的概念却具有相當的意義、值得我們敬佩的事、</p>
<p>青年們投考學校、眞好似武子胥進昭關一樣、難乎其難、尤其是投考國立的或立了案的專門學校、在事前、先要混得一個中等學校卒業的資格、還怕自已的學識不足應試、便又不得不經過相當準備、如複習已讀的功課、注重所考的科目、有的還專心的日夜攻讀那些投機出版者所編印的什麽「投考指南」·「常識百科問答」、以及商務的學生雜誌所刋載的歷年來國内各大學的入學試題、但是、這樣的準備還怕不能録取、於是懇托父兄相識的敎師和自已曾經認識的同學鼎力吹嘘、由此看來、升學眞是過昭關一樣、難乎其難也、</p>
<p>就是投考一個學校、也須經過幾許複雜的手續、如索章程哪、報名哪等等、在考試的那天還要提心吊胆地去應試、大有大難臨頭之勢、有時還要靜心默祝、企望能夠録取、在精神方面、可以說是受到莫大的損失、有的在夢中、也幻想到「名落孫山」而被驚醒了的、這等現象、我想凡是過來人都能明白的、在考完的後一天、是很早的就去買報讀、看自已所投考的學校那個録取新生的廣告、細細地從頭看到尾、如僥倖地被録取的話、那是多麽快樂的事呢、不但自已是心花怒放、在父兄也是洋洋得意、和我國科舉時代取了什麽秀才翰林一樣、眞的、現在有人說考取中學或大學即是得著洋秀才或洋翰林的頭銜、這雖然含有封建的喻意、但是這種甄别人才的良善方法、在現在還是沿用著、不過把科舉的名目更易爲考試吧了、所以、最近國民政府的考試院成立、也就是爲了這個原故、投考學校是個小社會裏的一種人才甄别、其意義實相彷彿因此、學校的考試被一般的重視、青年男女亦非等過這個階段不可、換一句話說、投考學校就是青年們進身的階梯、倘若投考最高學府、萬一不能録取的話、這是多麽引爲不快的事、有的竟走到消極之路、實行那種最無意義的自殺、有的是大哭一煬、爲投考悲劇的幕落、在後者是以女學生爲多、</p>
<p>復旦近兩年來、招收新生是抱着嚴格主義、尤其是文學院的新聞學系、要養成本國報館編輯人材和經營人材起見、所以每次録取新生較其它各系爲少、係這次、連轉學生一共録取五名、有許多未免要失望、有「名落孫山」之憾呢、鼎鼎大名的芬女士、就是投考這難有希望被録取的新聞學系、結果是撞了壁、她這次各科所得的成績外人却不甚明瞭、但是論理學試題是三個中選答兩個便算完卷、</p>
<p>據同學們看見她的答案、是這樣的、</p>
<p>一、證據的種類、</p>
<p>（答）不說誑語、不胡說八（這裏的一個「道」字、或許左女士一時記憶不起如何寫法、故留空白、）</p>
<p>二、内涵與外舉、</p>
<p>（答）論理學一定要有内涵、但一定也要外舉出幾個例來、總之、這都是論理學丨丨</p>
<p>上列的答案在作者是未敢更改一字、我雖然在從前也讀過一些論理學、不過時期太久了、所留的印象却很模糊、所以對於芬女士的答案是否未敢加以斷言、關於這些、還是一種小問題、最大的、是芬女士的文憑發現了贋品的弊害、</p>
<p>據芬女士說、這又是被她拒絶的那些男同學所弄的把戲、母須說、這次芬女士的投考新聞學系、的確是很引起許多同學們的注意、或許有些同學對她有所不滿或含有怨恨、就寫了一封信告發的匿名信註册處、說她這張文憑是她底姊姊的、並且舉出證據丨論理學上的證據種類的一種、於是、註册處就對她底文憑加以審查、結果是發覺它係贋品、當然、這次她取考的成績就是十分優良、也没有希望被録取的了、</p>
<p>現在海上各個立案的專門學校、對於學生的資格審查是十分嚴格、所以復旦當然不在例外、鼎鼎大名的芬女士、也就被此一紙文憑而落第了、</p>
<p>在考試完畢的那日下午、芬女士就提心吊胆地向註册處詢問一切、當然、祗有使她失望、她也由失望而號啕大哭起來、眞比什麽還傷心、比失掉了愛還要傷心呢、</p>
<p>復旦的同學素來就具有好奇心的、有一些事情、其實是極細微的、但他們或她們都要引爲大驚小怪、這次芬女士的哭、母須說是轟動全校、大家引爲趣聞的、芬女士在註册處門前蹬足大哭一般好奇的同學包圍四週、不但對她不表示深切的同情、並且鼓掌大笑、這笑又含有譏嘲之意、因此、芬女士哭得愈加痛心、幾乎不能成聲、眞是一幕考試塲中的悲喜劇、她做了這劇裏的重要主角、</p>
<p>在這情形之下、實無法可以挽救、芬女士的悲憤未能儘量的發洩、祇有忍氣吞聲地踱出子彬院（復旦文學院考試場處）、同學們老是不知趣、跟從在後面、她祇有默默地低着頭、闌珊地向前走去、在踏上了人力車、經過了翔殷道上、對復旦尚有戀戀不捨之意的向上海奔馳的時候、這一幕轟動全校的悲幕方告一段落、</p>
<h3>考試　洛湘</h3>
<p>明天要考解析幾何了、平日對於數學不用功的我們四個人、這晚、却不得不抱佛脚開了夜車把公式强記一下、</p>
<p>宿舍裏的電燈在十點鐘就要熄了、只有厠所和樓梯處點通夜的、但是、厠所的氣味太難受、樓梯處没有舒適些坐的地方、最後就决定到敎室中去開夜車、先去關照了一聲管鎖宿舍總門的媽子、起初她說、「不行、給沈先生丨舍監丨知道了是要駡的」、經我們告訴她、沈先生很早的就說頭痛去睡了、她才答應讓我們進來後替她上鎖、</p>
<p>開夜車要吃些東西才能驅逐睡魔、我們是很經騐的了、望了望舍監室裏没有人影、就偷偷的溜出了校門去買了許多水菓和糖菓帶到敎室裏、</p>
<p>我們把桌子都拚了攏來、把吃的東西攤在中間、一面吃着東西一面執着筆很認眞地把公式代進去演算、</p>
<p>桌上吃的東西漸漸都變了脚邊的皮壳、眼皮也漸漸的重起來、書上一個個黑字也漸漸的在眼前浮動、彼此都是接二連三的在打呵欠、</p>
<p>「怎辦呢、我們演得還不到三分之一呢、我已經倦得不堪了」、雲一面伸着懶腰、</p>
<p>「我又何嘗不倦、這數學眞怪不得要給我深恨、你看、它平日犧牲了我多少做其他事的鐘點、而今晚我舒舒服服睡覺的時間又破壞在它手裏、假使是選科的話、我眞不高興爲了它開什麽夜車、我情願這學分不要」、楚把數學書恨命的往桌上一碰、她是深恨數學的、只要一有機會她立刻要怨駡數學、</p>
<p>「假使是選科的話、我早已不選了」我說、</p>
<p>「喲、你們聽、什麽」、素來膽小的依、很驚惶的輕聲說、</p>
<p>深夜靜寂的空氣、只有我們彼此的呼吸聲可聽得到、簡或有一二聲汽車喇叭聲從遠遠的傳過來、</p>
<p>「是汽車聲吧」、</p>
<p>「不、我明明聽見的、是」「啐」的一聲、</p>
<p>似乎就在室外」、</p>
<p>「我没有聽見」</p>
<p>「我好像也聽見的」、</p>
<p>睡魔是已給這意外的事克去了、大家都注視着室外漆黑的走廊中、</p>
<p>「我們去睡吧、明天早上五點鐘就起來開早車預備好了」、這話是雲說的、但就是我們各人都要說的話、</p>
<p>我們四個人擠得很緊的有意踏出很大的脚步聲來壯自已的膽、走過了漆黑的走廊、進了宿舍都蒙着被頭睡了、</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>第二天、還是楚第一個醒、她把我們都呌醒了、一看已經七點多鐘、</p>
<p>「哈、開早車、我連起身鐘還没聽見呢」、</p>
<p>「今天要考的數學怎辦呢」、</p>
<p>「只有希望他出的題目就是昨晚我們所預備過的」、</p>
<p>「我也是這麽想、但是、不會的吧」、</p>
<p>大家都很不安心的吃好了粥、到敎室中去經過敎務處佈告處時突然一張紙很鮮目地耀進我們的眼簾、「數學敎師趙××先生病假」我們都快活的跳起來了、</p>
<h3>詩人佛</h3>
<p>「浦江多風雨、悄悄愁煞人、……」我們的詩人兼文學家徐光、正在室内鋪開錦箋、把他剛纔苦吟偶得的佳句寫上、還想不到續句、所以尚在咿唔、</p>
<p>「老徐又在寫什麽鬼東西了、公開、大家看、不是情書嗎、一一窩蜂擁進了林楨、王德、毛繼成三個、同時嚷着要徐光給他們看箋上的東西、</p>
<p>「不要胡閙、我正在做詩哩、這樣一吵、詩思都要逃光哩、」徐光一邊對他們說、一邊持箋給他們看、</p>
<p>「這一星期正是雨也太多、風也太多、簡直没有見過太陽、怪不的我們的詩人要發愁哩、」林楨說、</p>
<p>徐兄這兩句詩正是太好了、不知道你從那裏拾得、接下去的句子、要如前兩句一樣工、可爲難哩、」王德恭維着徐光說、</p>
<p>「正是、有點意思了、待我續下去、」徐光邊說邊拿起筆來、添上「工愁更善病、詩人倍傷神、」二句、於是擲筆頽然曰、「力竭矣、」</p>
<p>「好詩、好詩、這樣一來、更把我們詩人的身分添上、怕不要令人呌絶哩、老徐、快拿去登上「辛曰週刋」使天下人共賞、」毛繼成慫恿徐光說、</p>
<p>「媽的、上禮拜在日刋上做了一篇女學生與戀愛、」惹得俞女士一頓好駡、我是再也不開口了、」徐光雖然作着懊傷</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的語調、可是掩不了他得意的怪腔、</p>
<p>「好了、連俞女士都向詩人垂青了、恭喜、恭喜、」</p>
<p>「俞女士有啥好、身體太弱了、還是陸女士好看些、俞珠那一件及得陸梅心來、聽說她還有肺病呢、一平日慣捧陸女士的林楨、聽到他們提起俞女士、連忙把陸女士掮出來當護符、</p>
<p>俞陸兩女士是新入校的一年級生、仗着他們好看的面龐、圓活的社交、居然在學校裏閙得大響而特響、於是全校學生差不多目有視、視俞陸二女士、耳有聽、聽俞陸二女士、俞陸二女士成爲學生課餘談話的中心站在俞女士一邊的稱爲左派、站在陸女士一邊的稱爲右派、兩派在校中出版物上竟然大打其筆墨官司、校中正閙得烏烟瘴氣哩、所以徐光王德輩的談話、免不得又牽扯到兩女士身上、</p>
<p>「打倒右派份子、」四人中的三人嚷着、顯然都是左派、</p>
<p>「你們說俞女士好在那裏、」林楨憤憤然說、</p>
<p>「俞女士有細長而彎的眉毛、靈瓏活潑的眼烏珠、只要她向你一望、你連大氣都不開出、」</p>
<p>「俞珠的面龐、蘋果樣的顔色、笑起來、你可以看到雪白的牙齒、還有頰邊深深的酒窩兒、只要她向你一笑呀、你魂靈兒丢上半天、</p>
<p>「最美的還是兩條腿、曲線美呵、美呵、……内感呵、」徐光摇頭播腦的發揮他的宏論、並且還哼出一首小詩、</p>
<p>俞珠的美呵、</p>
<p>九天上的安琪兒都不如、</p>
<p>我要跪在她裙下摩拜、</p>
<p>我感謝上帝的奇蹟丨創造着一個伊、」</p>
<p>「罷了、俞珠的信徒、我不同你們辯了、」林楨覺得勢孤、一溜意的走了、</p>
<p>「阿林、逃走、難爲情、」王毛二人邊喝邊追出去了、</p>
<p>現在室内是又只剩着詩翁徐光一人、他驟然感到一種伊士披裏純、於是又提筆繼續作詩了、</p>
<p>「四壁冷清清、只有詩人的呻吟、一聲聲傳出窗外……」</p>
<h3>洋奴　忠卓</h3>
<p>爲了父親運氣不好、失了二三年的業、對於經濟就發生了拮据的問題起來了、</p>
<p>在一天凄雨的寂寞的晚上、我正在孤燈一盞、預備着開學的功課、在微微的燈光下、顯露出了父親枯黄的臉、聞到了他不自然的嗟嘆、在這嗟嘆聲中忽然發出了呌我的聲音、「連兒……」</p>
<p>可是下面的話還没有說完、他那眼眶中已包滿了熱的淚、欲說不說的狀態引起了我說話的動機、</p>
<p>「父親你要說什麽、就說罷、做兒子的一定肯順從的、」</p>
<p>他就硬着唳籠、斷續的說他欲說的話、</p>
<p>「連兒、以前的我、你也許在形色上看得出我是常常顯現着笑臉的、這幾年呢、一切的一切我大大的改變了、自從失了二三年業後、以前血汗換來的積蓄、已經受了二三年的使用、就要完了、本來我的一些希望、都在你的身上、現在在這危急存亡之秋、我不得不捨去了你的前程、光明偉大的希望、很不忍的停止了你的學業、要把你弱小無經騐的你、處身在黑暗社會的商界裏、或許你的學費及書費可以改輕些我生活的重擔、昨天王家伯伯已經來過、他已在一爿日本人開的洋行裏謀得了一個練習生的位置、大約在後天早上就要拿了你的行李去進店了、</p>
<p>前度已經說妥、對於你有些什麽意見呢」</p>
<p>以上的一切好像一個大大的鐵鎚、猛打了我的腦袋裏一下、所以打悶了、我的知覺已完全失去了、對於一切甚麽的甚麽都抱了一個莫明、不知道誰告訴我說的「父親、我很同意、去罷、」…………</p>
<p>現在呢、我已經心服情願的做了所謂「走狗」「洋奴」的勾當大約二年了、我好像受足了麻醉劑如的、對於以前學校時代的什麽「打倒帝國主義的口號、及一切轟轟烈烈的五四運動、反覺自已是呆的痴的、</p>
<p>在一句含有奸惡陰險帝國主義性的一聲「ＢＯＹ」、充滿着熱血的我、反心服情願的說一聲「ＹＥＳ」、這一點呢、是常常盤旋在我的腦海裏、面望着青青的天、白白的地、作無意識的苦笑、而不知其所以然、所以四週籠罩着黑暗的我、覺得經濟可以埋滅人的意志、可憐的我、前度没望的我、永遠抱着悲觀呵、</p>
<h3>異性病者　文字</h3>
<p>「喂老周、去吃咖啡好嗎」、李一邊這樣問、一邊却硬拖着周向共和飯店走去本來李與周是不大親暱的、雖然同在一校、除了相見時點了頭外、不曾有過長時間的談話、可是、如今却不然了、他天天要去找周談話吃咖啡、星期六便去看影戲似乎平時十分親暱得幾乎形影不離了、本來他蓬鬆不整的頭髮、如今也塗上了Stacornb梳得像電燈炮一樣了、本來是破舊的中衫裝「按並非中山裝之誤、乃長衫不長之謂也、」如今也穿起　挺的西裝來了、本來是只在房間裏讀書的好學生、如今却常在草場上走廓裏兜圈子了、總之、他以前的一切不是現在的一切了、</p>
<p>這樣不久、藉着他特具的用意、情巧的手段、從用的介紹中認識了姣姣的Miss王了、</p>
<p>李自從認識了王女士後的不多幾天中、校中便發生了一件有趣的新聞、在一二人的口中震入了全校的耳膜、他們這樣說、</p>
<p>「在某日的六時餘、晚飯中敲後的三五分鐘、李在東北角的曁球架下替王女士相面孔（按、相面孔即Kiss之謂也、）</p>
<p>這樣嘈維的傳說刺入了李的耳膜後、他知道事情是有些不妙、唬得不敢跑出宿舍門了、　　下一天他又聰說、「今天開校務會議、」立刻直跳起來、他以爲在校務會議中將處决他昨天的事了、他驚慌的趕到頗有勢力的陸先生處哀求解救、其實校務會又何嘗爲了他的事呢、</p>
<p>從這次的驚唬把他嚴懲了以後、他似乎不再像以前一樣去渴於追逐異性了</p>

<h3>New Gold Mines Operated in Outer Mongolia</h3>

<p>(Beiping) People from Inner Mongolia said that in the past six months, many people from Outer Mongolia have brought unrefined gold south, saying that the Outer Mongolian government is operating gold mines with 6 million new currency, without providing food.

The gold mined is owned by the workers themselves, called "outsiders." The mining area is in the upper reaches of the Tuul River, spanning 200 li. Two months ago, there were more than 9,000 workers. Fellow villagers in the Pingmeng Tibetan area wrote to persuade the Panchen Lama to take out a portion of the gold nuggets stored in the Six Nations Hotel to promote gold mines in Qinghai and Tibet, so that the Mongolian and Tibetan people can also cherish some light, and the Panchen Lama can also make a fortune.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Riotous Behavior in the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>I still remember that previously, in the Beijing Parliament in China, members fought because of meetings. People generally believed that the level of Chinese members was insufficient, so this ugly image was exposed. I believe that so-called people are not that far apart. When everything goes smoothly and they are in harmony, they show their noble personality. When they compete fiercely to the point of needing to win at all costs, then anything that human capabilities can do, they will do it. Therefore, the ugliness of Chinese members that the world finds strange today will one day be followed by the members of civilized countries, step by step. Or even worse. And there will be ugliness that China cannot perform. The fighting in the Japanese Parliament today, with pens and stationery flying around and used as weapons, is the same as the situation with Chinese members. Furthermore, using a small knife to injure someone and cause endless bleeding is even superior to Chinese members.</p>
<p>Not only does Japan, a parliamentary developing country, have this phenomenon. One day in the future, when advanced countries in European and American parliaments present a determination to win at all costs, the situation will undoubtedly be the same as today's Japanese parliament. Furthermore, it is not only at one end of the parliament. China, due to years of internal turmoil, has bandits and unrest that cannot be stopped. The world laughs because the people's level is immature. However, if world commerce is sluggish and the economy is depressed for a long time, then the so-called civilized and law-governed countries of today, once internal turmoil arises and loses control, the unrest of bandits in their countries will inevitably be no different from China, or even worse. This can also be asserted. Why? The so-called people in the world, when extremely bored and helpless, their actions are not much different.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Water Meadows of Northern Fezzan and Kufra, Italy and France Battle for Control</h3>
<p>Italian Troops Occupy, Situation Becomes Tense</p>
<p>British and French Negotiations on Border Demarcation Issues</p>
<p>▲ National Report from Paris on the 7th. Political circles here are focusing on the discussions between Britain and France regarding the Italian troop occupation of the Kufra water meadows in Northern Fezzan. According to the Paris Daily, the current discussions between the two countries concern the border demarcation issues between Egypt, Tripoli, Tunisia, and French Sudan. However, the Kufra water meadows are an important route to Lake Chad and are being contested by Italy and France. Therefore, it is expected that the border demarcation work will be very difficult, and the dispute between Italy and France over the Kufra water meadows will further intensify the situation between the two countries. However, another message states that the recent talks between the French Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador also touched on the issue of repaying French war debts, as the British Chancellor of the Exchequer intends to sue the French government in French courts, demanding that the principal and interest of British creditors be repaid in gold francs. Because paper francs are only worth one-fifth of gold francs, if the bonds purchased by the British are not calculated based on gold francs, they will lose 80% of their original investment.</p>
<h3>Greek-Bulgarian Border Shooting Incident</h3>
<p>Caused by Sheep Straying into Bulgarian Territory; Arousing Attention from Britain and Italy; May Be Submitted for Arbitration</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Athens, 7th - The Greek Foreign Minister met with the Bulgarian Envoy today and discussed the border shooting incident between Greece and Bulgaria for a long time. This case is not only valued by the people of both countries, but also attracts much attention from Britain and Italy. The fact that the envoys of the two countries jointly visited the Greek Foreign Minister, strongly urging a swift and peaceful resolution to avoid further complications, is evident. Although the Greek government's attitude is determined to lodge a strong protest with the Bulgarian government, it is also willing to accept arbitration. However, each country has its own version of the incident. The Greeks claim that their soldiers saw a herd of unattended sheep straying into Bulgarian territory and went to drive them back, but the Bulgarian soldiers suddenly opened fire, killing one Greek soldier. The Bulgarians claim that the Greek soldiers deliberately provoked the Bulgarian soldiers, resulting in a two-hour exchange of fire.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Sofia, 7th - Today, the British and Italian envoys jointly visited the Bulgarian Foreign Minister, strongly stating the necessity of a prompt and peaceful resolution to the Greek-Bulgarian border shooting incident. The case may now be submitted for arbitration.</p>
<h3>French Government Shipbuilding Plan</h3>
<p>To Be Submitted to Parliament for Discussion Soon</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 8th - The French naval issue will soon attract public attention. The government will submit a bill within a few days, stipulating the construction of one battlecruiser, two light cruisers, several submarines, and an unspecified number of unrestricted warships. It is reported that France plans to build more than one battlecruiser, with power exceeding that of German small battleships. The displacement of the French battlecruisers is expected to be 25,000 tons. This matter will spark debate, and the issues of naval reduction and the arrangements stipulated in London and Geneva will also arise. It is also reported that Germany is currently building five small battleships, each with a displacement of 10,000 tons. Construction of the first ship began in Kiel early last year, and the construction cost of the second ship was approved by Parliament in May last year. Each ship can generate 50,000 horsepower, and is equipped with six 11-inch guns, eight 6-inch guns, four 3.5-inch guns, and six torpedo tubes. The shells fired from the 11-inch guns weigh 670 pounds, and the speed is 16 nautical miles per hour, with a range of 10,000 nautical miles.</p>

<h3>German Extremist Parties Move to Impeach Government</h3>

<h3>Japanese Parliamentary Dispute</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - During the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 3rd, due to Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara's slip of the tongue, an ominous bloody incident occurred. After former speaker Ozaki Yukio's mediation failed the day before, the political and civil parties glared at each other without yielding. How to break this deadlock, the future is very chaotic. The government believes that if the slip of the tongue is withdrawn, it may lead to issues of responsibility, so it is difficult to comply with Inukai Tsuyoshi's request to compromise. Therefore, if compromise is sought, the government must modify the wording of the withdrawal, and formally consider Inukai's proposal. The Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party) can also use a more moderate phrase instead of the slip of the tongue, so that both parties can get closer. In this way, the government can avoid causing issues of responsibility, and the Seiyūkai can also implement its proposal. This second stage of negotiation will probably be carried out. The government department is also divided into two factions regarding the second stage of compromise: one advocates for a stable compromise, and the other advocates for a hard line, believing that if they are forced to compromise by the violence of the Seiyūkai, it will cause obstacles to future proceedings and leave a bad precedent, and they advocate moving forward according to the prescribed policy. The government is currently carefully studying this.</p>
<h3>Hamaguchi Stresses Concessions</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - Home Minister Adachi Kenzō visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi at his official residence at 7:30 last night, and reported on the subsequent developments regarding the slip of the tongue issue, and the opinions of Ozaki Yukio's mediation and Inukai Tsuyoshi's leader. He sought the Prime Minister's intentions. The Prime Minister was also very uneasy about this, and hoped to make concessions as much as possible without affecting the cabinet, and to sincerely and honestly reach a compromise to avoid harming constitutional operations. Home Minister Adachi also fully understood the Prime Minister's intentions, and immediately conveyed this intention to the cabinet ministers and party executives.</p>
<h3>Government Pursues Compromise</h3>
<p>▲Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - Ministers Adachi, Eki, and Matsuda, and executives of the Rikken Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party), held a meeting at the Home Minister's official residence and resolved a compromise plan (drafted by Eki and Adachi) as follows:</p>
<p>The government recognizes that Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara's response was a slip of the tongue and will frankly withdraw it. The method of expressing the withdrawal of the slip of the tongue is entirely up to Home Minister Adachi. After the Home Minister meets with Mochizuki Keigo, Chairman of the General Affairs Committee, he will present it.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The meeting between Home Minister Adachi and Chairman Mochizuki ended at 5:15 p.m. on the 8th. Mr. Mochizuki agreed to meet with Home Minister Adachi again at the Speaker's official residence at 9:00 p.m. after discussing the results with the party leaders and give a clear reply.

<h3>Seiyūkai Remains Firm</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 8th - The Seiyūkai is still dissatisfied with Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara's response to Mr. Shizui's question in the House of Peers yesterday regarding the slip of the tongue issue. As a result of the discussion, it was said that if Prime Minister Shidehara does not completely withdraw the slip of the tongue, no compromise can be agreed to. Regarding future compromises with the government and the party, the Seiyūkai does not want to express a positive attitude anymore, and will only decide whether or not to accept the concrete proposals presented by the party. The Seiyūkai's attitude remains firm.</p>
<p>▲Japan United News Agency dispatch - At 2:30 p.m. on the 8th, the Seiyūkai held a general meeting of representatives at its headquarters. Secretary-General Mori first spoke, saying that the continuous disputes at the general budget meeting were entirely due to the government's words and actions. Our attitude has not changed. The opposition party will do something out of frustration at this time. I hope that you will work harder and not slack off. We have a lot of materials to attack the government on finance, economy, and diplomacy, so we don't have to insist on the slip of the tongue issue, but it is inevitable for the sake of upholding the constitution.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor's Office Summons</h3>
<p>▲Japan United News Agency dispatch - The brawl in the House of Representatives caused the Rikken Minseitō to accuse more than 30 Seiyūkai members. Patrol Inspector Yoshikawa Shigeru of the Metropolitan Police Department also filed a complaint against nine members of the Seiyūkai for violence. The Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office decided to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to eliminate the root of the evil, because this kind of ominous incident in the parliament has occurred frequently in recent years. Although it was Sunday on the 8th, seven prosecutors including Deputy Prosecutor Matsuzaka went to the office from morning to question the people involved.</p>
<h3>Women's World Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>▲Japan United News Agency dispatch - The Tokyo Women's Federation decided to carry out a parliamentary purification movement because it could not silently watch the martial drama performed in the parliament every day. On the evening of the 7th, representatives were selected to visit Secretary-General Taguchi and protest, roughly saying that the parliament's brawl had a bad influence on children's education.</p>
<h3>Unstable Situation in Cuba</h3>
<p>Communists Set Fire to Sugar Cane Fields, Aiming to Provoke American Intervention</p>
<p>Martial Law Extended for Three Months</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 7th - According to news from the Cuban capital, the Cuban government has extended martial law for three months and closed all middle schools in the country because they are a source of incitement. Although army planes are inspecting the sky and rifle infantry are protecting the sugar cane fields, the burning of sugar cane fields occurs frequently. After the government discovered the arson movement, it issued a notice to soldiers and police to shoot and kill anyone found setting fire to sugar cane. However, arsonists are still active. Sugar cane that can produce 750,000 pounds of sugar was destroyed last night. Today, the police found three bombs in an American-owned factory and arrested twelve people. Many believe that the Communist Party is now attacking American industry, aiming to provoke American intervention and discredit the Cuban government.</p>
<h3>American Armed Intervention in Nicaraguan Civil War</h3>
<p>▲Associated Press, Managua (Nicaragua), 7th - The U.S. Marines fought with the rebels again today, and the rebels were defeated. Eighteen U.S. soldiers, led by a team, were patrolling in the mountains when 60 rebels ambushed them on the side of the mountain and launched an attack that lasted about 35 minutes. The U.S. soldiers finally repelled the attackers and wounded six enemies. None of the U.S. soldiers were killed or injured. Today's actions prove that the troops of Nicaraguan rebel leader General Sandino have not yet been defeated. Therefore, the U.S. patrol team stationed in Nicaragua should maintain its presence until the enemy party does not dare to harass them anymore.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Abuses Prisoners</h3>
<p>Forced to Work in Logging</p>
<p>Deaths Are Heard of Daily</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 8th - According to a sworn statement from a person who escaped from a Soviet Russian detention center, there are currently 662,000 prisoners engaged in logging work, many of whom are huddled together, with no shelter above and ice below. Typhoid fever is rampant, and tens of thousands of people have died. The prisoners do not have enough clothes to keep warm, or enough food to eat. People freeze and starve to death every day. Winter work starts at 5:00 a.m. and ends at 8:00 p.m., and 35 trees must be felled every four days. Those who do not meet this number are whipped and have their rations reduced. The statement has been recorded and submitted by Conservative MP Mr. [Name] to Prime Minister MacDonald. The public is eagerly awaiting the government's response to this matter.</p>
<h3>British Weaver Strike Persists</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 7th - The result of the British weavers' vote on January 24th was 90,770 votes against 44,990 votes rejecting the committee's proposal to negotiate the issue of increasing the number of looms per weaver. British Prime Minister MacDonald then convened representatives of employers and weavers on January 29th and 30th to engage in discussions, but the talks broke down and no agreement was reached. The Standing Committee of the Weavers' General Union met today to consider the report on the talks and discussed it for a long time. It was decided not to make a proposal to vote again on whether to continue negotiations. The opinions of the weavers' representatives on this matter are stronger than when the strike first began.</p>
<h3>New Zealand Earthquake Followed by Floods</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, London, 7th - British newspapers are still full of news about the disaster in New Zealand. It is now feared that the town of Wairoa in Hawke's Bay, North Island, will collapse completely, because the mouth of the Wairoa River has been blocked by the earthquake. Therefore, residents are fleeing in a panic. There are also reports of major floods in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Most of Brisbane is submerged, with water several feet high on land. Several towns along the coast of New South Wales, such as Lismore and Coraki, have also been half-destroyed by water.</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Palestine Under British Mandate</h3>
<p>Farm Children Forced to Sell Themselves into Prostitution; Officials Commonly Keep Maids</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Jerusalem, 7th - An Arabic newspaper sent a letter to the British High Commissioner, stating the suffering of Palestinian farmers, saying that many farmers are forced to sell their daughters under the age of 25. It would be a great fortune if these girls could truly become maids and not enter prostitution. Their selling price is only 20 pounds, and the introducer still has to take a commission of 2 pounds. It also said that government officials also take the opportunity to buy maids.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Gan Representative Appeals for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Yang Zuorong, a representative of the Gansu Relief Committee, came to Beijing to appeal for the Gansu refugees. He requested the Central Relief Committee, the Central Executive Committee, and the National Government to follow the example of Shaanxi, issue 10 million yuan in relief bonds to carry out urgent public works and relief, and allocate 200,000 yuan for urgent relief funds. He also requested to send high-ranking officials to distribute the funds in person. If the above two items are difficult to handle, then please pay the outstanding 160,000 yuan from the 200,000 yuan of cash allocated to Gansu by the Relief Committee in the 18th year of the Republic of China, and send personnel to distribute it to alleviate the urgent need. The original presentation is as follows: Presenting a request for the urgent allocation of relief funds, sending high-ranking officials to inspect the distribution, and issuing 10 million yuan of relief bonds as an example to relieve the disaster victims. Gansu's disaster situation is more serious than that of Henan and Shaanxi. The Gansu Provincial Relief Committee and its representatives have repeatedly stated to Your Excellency, and I hope you will understand. This time, the Gansu Provincial Relief Committee specially sent me, Yang Zuorong, to Beijing to plead for the people. In fact, the number of people in Gansu who have died from disasters such as drought, epidemic diseases, earthquakes, soldiers, and bandits in recent years has exceeded 2.5 million. The disaster victims who are waiting to be fed are no less than 3.1 million. If the central government does not immediately allocate funds to relieve the 3 million disaster victims who are dying, they will inevitably fill the ditches. Moreover, Gansu's situation is now that there is no one in charge. Various powerful factions in the province have become divided, and government orders are inconsistent. How can the people bear it? Alas, my Gansu people have not been able to reduce the suffering of being in dire straits, and the disaster victims who have been displaced are even more miserable. I implore Your Excellency to promote the spirit of universal love and kindness of the late Premier, and uphold the grand purpose of disaster relief and poverty alleviation. Considering that the people of Gansu have been exploited and slaughtered by Feng Yuxiang's subordinates, and burned and massacred by bandits and mutinous soldiers, those who have been trapped in dire straits have been suffering for five years. The central government's reach is too far, and the disaster victims have no way to appeal, so that their grievances have sunk to the bottom of the sea and remain suspended to this day. Gansu people are inherently weak and unable to extricate themselves. How can the state have no responsibility to eliminate harm for the people? However, because the great scourge has not been eliminated and the national crisis is still underway, we painfully look forward to this day. Now, unification has been achieved and the whole country is celebrating. The disaster victims in the Northwest must be treated equally by the central government, and funds will be allocated for relief. I implore you to take Shaanxi Province as an example, allocate 200,000 yuan for urgent relief funds, and send high-ranking officials to inspect and release them in person, to appease the refugees and provide them with plows to prepare for spring planting and prevent famine. In addition, the central government will issue 10 million yuan in relief bonds to handle urgent public works and relief, to cultivate the local vitality that has been lost, and to make good arrangements for the Northwest, and to establish a foundation for national unity and peace. If urgent relief funds are difficult to raise at once, and the orphans and remnants are difficult to wait for a long time, please immediately allocate the 160,000 yuan of cash that was specially allocated to Gansu in the 18th year of the Republic of China by the Central Relief Committee of Your Association, and pay it in full to alleviate the urgent need. This is also what the people of Gansu have been praying for day and night. Therefore, I do not hesitate to risk being presumptuous, and prepare this document to submit to Your Association. I earnestly request that you grant your approval, which would be a great blessing. Respectfully presented to the Central Relief Committee, the Central Executive Committee, and Chairman Chiang of the National Government, by Yang Zuorong, representative of the Gansu Provincial Relief Committee, respectfully presented on February 3.</p>
<h3>The Process of Jin General Sending Jing Yaoyue to Liaoning</h3>
<p>▲Mr. Jing Returned to Taiyuan to Report Zhang Xueliang's Intentions</p>
<p>▲Tianjin Agreement Resolved to Maintain but Can Be Remedied</p>
<p>Taiyuan Communication: After the Jin generals issued the "clever telegram," they were deeply afraid that the parties would not understand the truth, so they specially sent Gu Renfa, Guo Zhongdao, and Jing Yaoyue to Beijing, Liaoning, and Jin to meet Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang to explain in detail. Mr. Jing, who went to Liaoning, has already returned the day before yesterday. Yesterday (the 2nd) morning, Sun Chu hosted a banquet at the Zhengda Hotel to welcome Mr. Jing, and various army commanders participated. After the banquet, they went to Sun Chu's private residence to hold a meeting. Mr. Jing reported on his trip to Liaoning and Zhang Xueliang's opinions. The main points are: (1) Zhang insists on maintaining the Tianjin Agreement. Zhang has deeply understood the army commanders' hard feelings for issuing the clever telegram, and promised to find ways to remedy it within the possible scope. (2) The army commander system will still be retained. In addition to the eight divisions of the Jin army, an additional railway protection army will be formed, and a Jinnan, Jinbei, and Taiyuan garrison army will be established, all of which can be discussed and handled together. (3) The total number of troops will be 50 large regiments, and military salaries will be allocated by several provinces in Northeast China and Hebei. The remaining officers will be sent to the Beiping Military Academy. Mr. Jing also said that Vice Commander Zhang has a very good impression of the generals of Jin and Sui. The Tianjin Agreement is not Zhang's personal opinion. The army commanders' clever telegram explained the difficulties, so that Zhang could understand the actual situation of the Jin and Sui armies, and it greatly helped Zhang in handling the aftermath of the North. As for the few politicians outside who are provoking trouble, Zhang will never believe them. After Mr. Jing's report, the army commanders felt that the result was satisfactory, and decided to hold a third joint meeting of all generals at the headquarters within a few days to decide on the reorganization method. At 5 o'clock, except for Sun Chu and Li Shengda who continued to talk with Mr. Jing, the remaining army commanders went to Kong Fanwei's mansion in Beicang Lane for a banquet. During the banquet, the troop reduction issue was re-discussed and dismissed at 9 o'clock.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Jing's statement, roughly, "I, Jing, call myself," left Taiyuan the day before yesterday, representing the army commanders here to visit Zhang and explain everything in person. On the first day of arriving in Shenyang, Vice Commander Zhang sent his Secretary-General Wang Shuhan to visit and inquire about the opinions and difficulties of the Jin generals. I immediately explained in detail. The next day, I met with Zhang. Because Zhang is responsible for handling the aftermath of the North, he very much wanted to clearly understand the actual situation of the Jin army. Therefore, when we met, he was very pleased. At this time, I detailed the difficult situation of reorganization in accordance with the Tianjin Agreement, and said that the original intention of reorganization was to reduce the burden on the people. If the method is not good, after the reorganization, the soldiers will turn into bandits. Not only will the burden not be reduced, but it will add danger to the people. Isn't this contrary to the purpose of reorganization? Zhang expressed great agreement with this point, and said that the Tianjin Agreement was also the result of many exchanges of telegrams between Jin's representatives Shang Xuyang and General Commander Chiang Kai-shek, and it was not my personal prejudice. If the generals had explained the difficulties in Tianjin at that time, then I would have been able to adopt them. Now that the order has been issued, in any case, I hope to maintain the original plan in principle. As for remedial measures, they can be discussed at length. I admire the spirit of the Jin generals who are earnestly working for the country and the people. After talking for two hours, I excused myself and left. On the morning of the third day, Zhang sent his Secretary-General Wang Shuhan again to invite me to the Vice Commander's Department to talk. After meeting Zhang, Zhang said that the reorganization of the Jin army should be handled quickly. I have fully understood the opinions of the generals. The separation of military and civilian affairs can also be agreed. I share the same concern with the generals for the administration of Jin and the settlement of its aftermath. As long as it benefits the country and the people, I can change the handling method in addition to maintaining the principle of the original plan. Please, sir, return to Taiyuan and convey my message to the generals to discuss and handle it quickly. I arrived here last night and have reported everything to the army commanders." (3rd)</p>
<h3>New Regulations Implemented on the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>▲The Reduction of Freight Rates Becomes a Distortion</p>
<p>▲The Harbin-Manzhouli Line Has the Largest Reduction</p>
<p>▲The Soviet Side Has Three Functions</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: The new regulations of the Chinese Eastern Railway were implemented on February 1 by the Board of Directors ordering the railway bureau. Since that day was Sunday, the railway bureau delayed until the evening of the 2nd to notify all stations on the three lines to comply. However, the International Sleeping Car Company and ticket agents were notified by the Board of Directors one day earlier to sell tickets and collect fares in accordance with the new regulations. Therefore, on the 1st and 2nd, passengers and merchants transporting goods through the International Sleeping Car Company or ticket agents enjoyed the benefit of reduced prices. Those who purchased tickets and transported goods at the railway stations themselves paid according to the old regulations. The new regulations were decided on January 12 by the joint meeting of the railway directors and supervisors, and two Chinese and Russian directors were assigned to form a regulations committee to discuss in detail. According to the decision of the joint meeting of directors and supervisors, the freight rate must be reduced by 40% and the passenger fare by 20%. However, there were many disputes in the regulations committee since the meeting was opened. The Russian committee member always believed that it was inappropriate to completely reduce the freight rate on the entire line. When asked for the reason, he only said that the Harbin-Manzhouli, Harbin-Suifenhe, and Harbin-Changchun lines have different mileages, and the reduction in freight rates must also be proportional to the length of the line. The Harbin-Manzhouli line is related to the export of soybeans, a special product of northern Manchuria, so it should be specially reduced to show the railway's support for the export of agricultural products. The Chinese committee member could not refute it, so it was decided. Therefore, the freight rate of the Harbin-Manzhouli line was reduced by about 40%, the Harbin-Suifenhe line by 25%, and the Harbin-Changchun line by 12% according to the regulations promulgated on February 1. The passenger fare of the Harbin-Manzhouli line was reduced by just over 25%, the Harbin-Suifenhe line by just over 12%, and the Harbin-Changchun line by only 2%. The Chinese Eastern Railway is related to the import and export of products from northern Manchuria. The Harbin-Changchun line is the necessary route for freight transportation in the interior. All domestic travelers and refugees who come to northern Manchuria for farming must take the Harbin-Changchun train to Harbin. Now, the freight and passenger fares have not been reduced in any way. The economy, commerce, and people's livelihood of northern Manchuria are still affected by the blockade. It is said that the Russian side advocates the disparate fare reduction between the Harbin-Manzhouli, Harbin-Suifenhe, and Harbin-Changchun lines for three reasons: (1) to enable the special products of northern Manchuria to travel in reverse and be transported to Europe via Siberia, ostensibly to resist the South Manchuria Railway and the Jihai and Fenghai railways, and secretly to help the Russian railways absorb freight; (2) to keep the economy of northern Manchuria in the hands of Soviet Russia, allowing it to manipulate it in order to create an economic panic and become a source of communist unrest in the future; (3) to facilitate the transportation of Soviet Russian goods to Northeast China, so that they can be promoted on the market at low prices, compete with Japanese goods, expand its economic power, and promote its Far East economic planning. The Chinese people must not neglect this cunning plan. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Complies with Order to Abolish Salt Surtax in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Regarding the Anhui Provincial Government's imposition of a salt surtax, it is now known that after the Executive Yuan received the National Government's instruction to quickly order the Anhui Provincial Government to abolish it, the Executive Yuan, in addition to strictly ordering the Anhui Provincial Government, also informed the Ministry of Finance with Instruction No. 52. The original order said, "According to the National Government's Instruction No. 56, the salt tax is a national income and should not be collected as a surtax by local governments. It was previously ordered to be forwarded by the Executive Yuan to all provinces for compliance. All provinces that originally had a salt surtax were required to uniformly transfer it to the Ministry of Finance for unified verification and collection on March 1, 1921, in order to publicly reduce and exempt it and make overall arrangements. No excuses were allowed to delay. However, after the Anhui Provincial Government was ordered to unify the salt tax, it suddenly added a provincial defense surtax of 2 yuan and 4 jiao per dan. The people's organizations in the province have repeatedly submitted petitions requesting that it be ordered to be abolished. The Executive Yuan has successively ordered telegrams ordering the abolition of the salt surtax on a fixed date to uphold the laws and appease public opinion. Unexpectedly, it has not been complied with so far. It is reported that there are also incidents of sealing warehouses, detaining ships, and suppressing the progress of the matter in Tunxi and Bengbu. The voices of appeals from all parties are becoming increasingly urgent. If it is not strictly prohibited and ordered to be abolished, how can government orders be maintained and public opinion be appeased? It is necessary to urgently order the Anhui Provincial Government to comply with the above and abolish the newly added salt surtax immediately. There must be no further delays or resistance. A report on the handling situation must be submitted. Be sure of this order, etc." After receiving this order, the Anhui Provincial Government has repeatedly been ordered by this court to abolish the surtax on Anhui Southern Zhejiang compliance, Anhui Northern Huai Salt, and Lu Salt. It is now found that the Provincial Government has not yet complied, and is still sealing warehouses, detaining ships, and oppressing in various ways in places such as Tunxi and Bengbu. This is not only contrary to the central government's orders, but also harmful to national taxation and people's livelihood. The previous reasons for the order are not only to order the Provincial Government to abolish this surtax immediately, and there must be no further delays or resistance, but also to report back. It is appropriate to order the Ministry to be informed immediately.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Business Tax to be Implemented Soon</h3>

<h3>Protection-of-Railway Commander at Pubeng Sends Troops to Suppress Remnants of Ma Yuren's Forces</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Ma Yuren's troops have been harassing the Funing and Yancheng areas of Jiangsu Province. Despite repeated suppression by the National Army, they have not been completely eradicated. Zhang Zhi-jiang, Pacification Commissioner of Jiangsu, recently ordered the troops of Liang Guan-ying, Commander of the 25th Route Army, and Zhang Hua-tang's 1st Cavalry Division, to be responsible for the suppression. It is now reported that the remnants of this force have fled into the territory of Suyuxian County in eastern Anhui, mixing with the bandit gang of Jiang Guo-chang (known as "Three-Legged"), harming the local area and attempting to intrude into the Chuzhou area. Zhang Li-sheng, commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division stationed in Bengbu and Commander for the Protection of the Jinpu Railway between Pubeng, upon receiving a report from the Mengxian county government, fearing that this force would flee west and affect traffic on the Jinpu Railway, specifically ordered the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade under his command, stationed in Mingguang and the 12th Regiment of the 4th Brigade under the command of Ma Jie-wu, stationed in Bengbu, to proceed to suppress them. After receiving the order, Ma's regiment, carrying mortars, departed from Bengbu on the Jinpu Railway on the 5th. Upon arriving in Chuzhou, they will disembark and join Wang's regiment. It is reported that Wang's regiment has already departed from Mingguang. (February 6th)</p>
<h3>Douglas Fairbanks Passes Through Tianjin En Route to Beiping</h3>
<p>▲ Extremely Enthusiastic Welcome from All Circles</p>
<p>▲ Fairbanks to Stay in Beiping for Four Days</p>
<p>▲ Fairbanks' Passage Through Tianjin: American martial arts movie star Douglas Fairbanks, joining a tour group on the "Belgian" ship, is on a tour of the Far East. In response to a telegram from Mei Lanfang, he arrived in China yesterday (the 4th). Originally scheduled to pass through Tianjin en route to Beiping at 3:00 PM, movie fans in Tianjin rushed to the East Station to welcome him around 2:00 PM after hearing the news. Mei Lanfang had entrusted Yan Zhi-kai, director of the Tianjin Art Museum, to represent him in welcoming Fairbanks at Qinhuangdao, and also sent Gao Meng-yi from Beiping to Tianjin to represent him in welcoming him. However, the ship was delayed due to weather conditions, arriving in Qinhuangdao at 4:30 PM. The special train for welcoming Mei arrived at Tianjin Station at 5:40 PM, with a Party-State flag hanging on the front of the train, with the words "Welcome" in the middle. Before the train had come to a complete stop, Chinese and foreign spectators, standing on tiptoe, had filled the train windows. However, Fairbanks had already disembarked from the fourth car from the front of the train. After Fairbanks got off the train, he was immediately surrounded by welcomers. The sound of "Douglas Fairbanks" resounded, creating a hubbub. Fairbanks, wearing a beige coat and a casual hat, shook hands with the welcomers one by one, expressing his friendliness. Those requesting autographs and photographers were in fierce competition, all considering it an honor to obtain a true image or a handwritten signature. At this time, Mei's representative, Gao Meng-yi, met Fairbanks amidst the crowd, stated his intentions, and invited Fairbanks to board the special train. Fairbanks, citing the limited time in Tianjin, gave a brief speech to the reporters from the newspapers, saying, "This time I came to China again, due to the good impression I had during my last visit. Because China is a country rich in artistry, and Beiping is especially an important cultural center in North China, I decided to accept Mei Lanfang's invitation and go to Beiping for a visit. As for my subsequent plans, since I have already been to Shanghai, after returning from Beiping, I will still board the ship in Qinhuangdao and then go directly to Siam for a visit." He also said, "The Japanese film industry is losing its previous vitality, because both sound and silent film production have not established a proper foundation. The future of the Chinese film industry is not as bleak as Japan's. If the Chinese film industry can seek good equipment, and if ambitious young people continue to work hard, the results will be immeasurable. The Hollywood film industry is still in a vortex of competition between sound and silent films. It is not yet known who will win in the future. This time, my visit to Beiping at Mei's invitation is purely a visit and does not carry any mission. If Mei can go to the United States to make sound films in the future, it would be my personal hope, but I have no task of inviting Mei to join the American film industry." Fairbanks also said that his wife, Mary Pickford, is currently in India and sends telegrams every day. Yesterday, he received another telegram from her, urging him to make a trip to Beiping to admire China's civilization. He encountered the "Belgian" tour group in San Francisco and joined them. After arriving in Japan, he decided to come to Beiping, and so on. As he spoke, it was almost time for the train to depart. Fairbanks shook hands with the welcomers one by one, said goodbye, and boarded the train to Beiping.</p>
<p>▲ Fairbanks' Arrival in Beiping: In Beiping, welcomers arrived at the station one after another from 6:00 PM on the 4th, about two thousand people, with women accounting for slightly less than half. The police at the station were all armed, and the order was quite good due to strict enforcement. Mei Lanfang arrived at the station around 9:00 PM to host the welcome. Qi Rushan served as the general director of the welcome, and Han Peiting was the general commander, leading theater colleagues, carrying four large gauze lanterns and dozens of small gauze lanterns to welcome Fairbanks at the station. In addition, representatives from various institutions and personnel from the American Embassy also came to the station to welcome him, making it quite a grand occasion. At 9:15 PM, Fairbanks' special train arrived at the station. After Fairbanks got off the train, he first shook hands with Mei, and then interacted with the welcoming personnel one by one. The crowd swarmed and surrounded Fairbanks and Mei, making it impossible to move. People presented business cards, asking Fairbanks to sign autographs. The crowd outside the station also poured into the station, and many of the lanterns of Mei's theater troupe were crushed, creating a cacophony of cracking sounds. Fairbanks, Mei, and others were caught in the crowd and followed the crowd. After some time, they finally exited the station. Fairbanks and Mei boarded the same car, and the crowd squeezed to the side of the car. After the police separated the crowd, the car was able to move forward. At 9:45 PM, they arrived at Li Luguo's residence on Dafangjia Hutong. Li's residence is spacious, elegant, and unique. Entering through the door to the northeast is a Chinese and Western living room, followed by a Western-style dining room. Passing through the east corridor, one enters the north upper room, with bedrooms on the east and west sides, which are prepared for Fairbanks to live in. A Western-style bed with a large red brocade quilt is placed in the middle, along with photos of Fairbanks and his wife. Further in is a bathroom. In general, this room is a magnificent Chinese-style house, with both Chinese and Western furnishings, antique and pleasant. Mei also displayed ancient artifacts related to Chinese culture to enhance the spectacle. Not long after Fairbanks and Mei arrived at Li's residence, reporters arrived for an interview. Fairbanks and Mei came out together to meet them. Fairbanks said that he was deeply impressed by the politeness and diligence of the Chinese people. When asked about the future of sound films, Fairbanks said that sound films lack dramatic interest and are difficult to be optimistic about. In two years, or due to artistic progress and improvement, in the future, there may be a compromise product between sound and silent films. When the reporter asked about his history of success, Fairbanks was reluctant to talk about his personal success story, but said that he could briefly talk about the success story of his wife, Mary Pickford. It is said that she can win the sympathy of the audience in her performances, and she was awarded the title of "Queen of Cinema." When she was five years old, listening to her mother tell stories, she was always moved by the plot of the stories. Her success today was probably conceived here. When asked about his wife's age, Fairbanks refused to tell, Fairbanks said that he was inconvenient to tell this, otherwise, he would be blamed by her, and laughed. The reporter then shook hands and bid farewell. That evening, Fairbanks and Mei had dinner together. Western food was originally prepared, but Fairbanks wanted to eat Chinese food, so it was changed, and he used chopsticks to eat.</p>
<p>Fairbanks' itinerary in Beiping: On the first day (4th), a banquet was held at Dafangjia Hutong. On the second day (5th), in the morning, he visited Zhongshan Park, the Ancient Artifacts Exhibition Hall, Beihai, etc. At 4:00 PM, there was a tea party at Mei Lanfang's residence on Wuliang Daren Hutong.

<p>Continued Dispatch of Troops to Suppress Bandits in Punan: After the abduction of eight men and women in Shenyouche, Yangxupu the other night, the township of Juting in this county is uneasy. Chief Pan of the branch bureau immediately led the entire police force to patrol and defend overnight to prevent criminals. Yesterday, the county government of this county, according to reports, said that the bandits in Jinshan may flee to Songyin, Hougang, Tinglin and other places in the southern part of Song Territory with the intention of large-scale looting. Therefore, the Secretary Zhou and Director Zhang were delegated to take steamships and depart yesterday to inspect everything in Tinglin, Zhangyan, Songyin, Hougang, Yangxupu and other places.

They twisted Guanbing's wife and used fire to burn her nose, nipples, and vulva, forcing her to reveal the whereabouts of silver. However, Guanbing's family was very poor and had nothing to steal. Only a few quilts and sundries were stolen. Then they went to the home of Ma Erbao and tied Ma's wife with cotton wadding, intending to inflict cruel punishment. Ma's wife, seeing that her sister-in-law had already suffered cruel torture, quickly revealed that her mother had deposited five hundred yuan, as well as more than one hundred yuan she already had. The robbers stole all of it, and then stole some marinated chicken and other items from the cookhouse and cooked them.

The woman was about twenty-seven or eight years old, wearing a black cheongsam, a hat, and a wool shawl. She looked pretty. Seeing Lu's wife, she called her "Sister, I haven't seen you for a long time." When Lu's wife saw her, she was at a loss and stared blankly for a long time. Seeing her hesitation, the woman said again, "I am someone from Wangshi, don't you recognize me? I have a secret to tell you." Then she went into the room and said, "Your Lu Sanbao is now in a bandit den. The robbers are asking for four thousand yuan for the ransom. If you give me six hundred yuan, I will negotiate for you and guarantee his safe release." While Lu's wife was half in doubt and half in belief, she was discovered by her brother, who, fearing it was a fraud, scolded her and Lu's wife also refused.

<h3>Chen Xihao's Talk in Macau</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, Chen Xihao, a member of the Executive Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters, went to Macau to recuperate due to his poor health. He often visited Yang Heling, a revolutionary veteran and friend of Sun Yat-sen, and enjoyed visiting scenic spots such as Sun Yat-sen's former residence in Cuiheng Village. He returned to Shanghai from Macau yesterday. A reporter from the Guomin News Agency interviewed him at his residence, and he provided a detailed account of the situation in Macau. Macau was ceded to Portugal forty-three years ago, and activities like smoking, drinking, gambling, and prostitution are extremely prosperous, demonstrating the Portuguese government's policy of trying to destroy the national spirit of the Chinese people. The following is a summary of Chen's remarks: Macau is a small peninsula south of Zhongshan County, with an area of about four or five square miles. It was leased to the Portuguese in the thirteenth year of the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty, with annual rent payments. It was not ceded until the thirteenth year of the Guangxu era. Because there were no clear boundary markers at the time, the Portuguese continued to encroach, and there is still no clear demarcation line. The administrative organization follows a governor system, with the current acting governor being Mai Jialing. Under the governor, there are departments of civil administration, finance, police, land, and bureaus such as the Economic and Public Funds Bureau. The governor has a political affairs council, and the citizens have a municipal council. The population is about 100,000, with Chinese people accounting for 92%, the rest being Portuguese and natives. Government expenses are mainly derived from tobacco and gambling taxes. Various gambling taxes amount to about 2 million per year, and opium taxes about 1.2 million. Other taxes include those from brothels, alcohol, paper cigarettes, and business licenses. It is said that during the Yang-Liu rebellion, annual gambling taxes could reach 6 million. There are many types of gambling, such as Fantan, Pai Gow, Mahjong, all available. Every Saturday and Sunday, gamblers from Guangdong and Hong Kong gather there, making it extremely lively. Using the opening of opium and gambling to maintain government expenses is unheard of in other countries, yet the Chinese people are content with it. This is truly lamentable. Commerce is not very developed due to its proximity to Hong Kong. There are almost no factories. What sustains the city is gambling. In education, the Portuguese run a high school, while the Chinese run several junior high schools. Primary schools are quite developed. In transportation, there are cars and rickshaws. Recently, there has been a long-distance bus service from Macau to Shiqi. Shiqi is now the seat of the Zhongshan County government. Because of the development of Zhongshan Port, the county government has been moved to Tangjiawan, the hometown of Mr. Tang Shaoyi. Party affairs cannot be conducted openly to this day. The Macau branch is located in Wanzi across the sea, with over 100 party members. 70% of them are merchants, and the rest are from the academic world. There are very few workers. Westerners call Macau "Macan," which is an abbreviation of "Mazu Ge," meaning the Temple of Mazu. This temple was built by people from Fujian. It is said that when the Portuguese first arrived, they did not know the name of the place and named it after the temple. Sun Yat-sen's former residence is in Cuiheng Village, very close to Zhongshan Port. Mr. Lu Haodong and Yang Heling were both from the same village as Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Heling is the only surviving member of the "Four Bandits" that Sun Yat-sen referred to at the time. He currently serves as a secretary in Macau, and is shrewd and forthright, worthy of being a revolutionary veteran. The total number of troops, including infantry, artillery, and sailors, is no more than two or three hundred, and the military strength is very weak. There are about 600 police officers, with Chinese people and natives accounting for two-thirds. There are two warships patrolling the river and three coastal batteries. The construction of the new port is very grand, with expenses reaching 12 to 13 million yuan. It is said that these expenses are also derived from tobacco and gambling taxes.</p>

<h3>Silk Merchants Eager for Issuance of Public Bonds</h3>
<p>▲ Letters and Telegrams from Various Parties</p>
<p>The financial community is providing assistance to silk merchants by accepting silkworm cocoons as collateral and temporarily issuing dry cocoon warehouse receipts to help them start their businesses. It is hoped that the silk industry public bonds will be issued as soon as possible to provide working capital, which is of utmost importance. The various news regarding the silk factory public bonds received yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Wuxi Merchants Sent Letter Requesting Prompt Issuance: Shen Huachen, chairman of the Special Committee for the Relief of the Silk Industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, and others, received a joint letter from 33 companies in Wuxi, including Yisheng, with the following content: "Chairman Shen Huachen and all committee members, we respectfully inform you that the resolution to issue public bonds for the relief of the silk industry has been made for a long time, and the amount of the bonds has been determined long ago. The anticipation of the issuance of the bonds by the merchants is greater than the hope for rain during a severe drought. However, it has been repeatedly delayed, and there is no definite date for issuance. Recently, the silk market has plummeted again, European sales are sluggish, and news of the public bonds has once again become silent. All merchants are greatly alarmed. If the issuance is delayed further, it will be difficult for the factories to survive. This concerns the entire silk industry and is imminent. Therefore, we specially request the chairman to use your best efforts to urge a prompt issuance to relieve the plight of the merchants in Jiangsu. We are extremely grateful and await your instructions." (omitted below)</p>
<p>▲ Minister Song's Telegram Instructed Relief Time: Chairman Shen of the Special Relief Committee received Telegram No. 5558 from Finance Minister Song, stating: "The relief time for this silk industry relief has been approved. All raw silk that has been inspected and weighed or that has been received by exporters but not yet paid for by factories before January 15th is not included. Please contact first."</p>
<p>▲ Executive Yuan's Directive Has Been Approved: A few days ago, Shen Huachen and others from the Factory Silk Industry Relief Special Committee went to the Central Bank to petition Vice Minister Zhang of Finance. Vice Minister Zhang personally handed over Directive No. 301 from the Executive Yuan, received by Huang Jinqing of the Ministry of Finance, stating: "(Regarding the presentation of the draft regulations for the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk industry public bonds and the amortization and interest payment table, and clarifying the five points for consultation, requesting instructions for compliance.)" All presented documents have been duly noted. It has been decided at the tenth National Affairs Conference to send them to the Legislative Yuan. Apart from sending them as a case and ordering them to be handled, it is hereby ordered for your information. This order.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Support Association Cables External Affairs Ministry to Strive for Increased Tax Case in Dutch Colony</h3>
<p>▲ Negotiations Have Been Effective</p>
<p>▲ Would Rather Fail After Great Effort</p>
<p>The China-Netherlands Diplomatic Support Association of the Republic of China held a meeting yesterday and resolved to cable the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue negotiations on the increased immigration tax in the Dutch colony. The original text is recorded below: "To the esteemed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: The colonial council of the Dutch colony passed a resolution the year before last to increase the immigration tax from 100 guilders to 150 guilders per person, effective July 1, 1929. After citizens residing in Beijing, including Lin Youren, submitted a petition to your ministry for negotiations, the increase was postponed. Subsequently, the council again passed a resolution last year to implement the increase from January 1, 1931. The Chinese Overseas Association repeatedly requested negotiations beforehand, and the Xiao Anti-Dutch Assembly continued to petition afterward. Fortunately, your ministry instructed Chargé d'Affaires Dai in the Netherlands to protest in various ways, which ultimately attracted the attention of the Dutch Parliament and the consideration of the Dutch Colonial Council. This is the most successful achievement since the establishment of Sino-Dutch diplomatic relations. According to a Medan telegram, the tax increase has been postponed again. The duration of the postponement will depend on the intensity of our country's resistance. If our country does not continue to strive, it will be implemented on March 1. If we can continue to fight vigorously, the postponement can be indefinite. Considering that approximately 200,000 Chinese people go to the Dutch colony each year, paying an immigration tax of 100 guilders, the annual requirement is 20 million guilders. If each person pays an additional 50 guilders, it will increase by another 10 million guilders. According to the current exchange rate, 10 million guilders is equivalent to approximately 20 million national currency, which is a significant loss. Your ministry has accepted public opinion and the negotiations have been effective. It is like building a mountain, we would rather fail after great effort. The association's sole purpose is to assist the government in negotiations with the Netherlands. We earnestly request your ministry to approve the instruction to Chargé d'Affaires Dai in the Netherlands and Consul General Zhang in Java to continue to strive in every way within their respective jurisdictions to achieve the goal of abolishing the resolution. The timing is urgent, and we are anxious to await your instructions." The China-Netherlands Diplomatic Support Association of the Republic of China, respectfully yours, Geng.</p>

The various documents are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Declaration of the Representatives' Meeting To all elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots across the nation: Tracing back to the past, our newspaper workers, under the contract system and the trampling of warlord iron hooves, worked nearly fifteen or sixteen hours a day. The wages we received were not only insufficient to support our families, but were barely enough for our personal daily needs. Our various hardships are too numerous to recount. When the Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, our workers, influenced by the trend of the times and for the sake of our own livelihood, organized a trade union in accordance with Article 11 of our Party's domestic policy and signed a mutually beneficial contract with the capitalists. For four years, we have lived in peace. The right of workers to be hired and dismissed has always been exercised by the trade union, and the capitalists have never interfered. This has become the custom of newspaper workers, and we have never heard of any dereliction of duty. This time, the Municipal Party Department sent personnel to reorganize our association based on a central government order. The reason given was that the new trade union law promulgated by the central government is no longer applicable to the current law, so all trade unions across the country must be reorganized according to the law. Under this order, our association had no room for hesitation. However, when the Civil Training Committee of the Party Department summoned our association to the Social Bureau for talks the other day (the 4th), when our association asked whether the previously signed labor-management contract should still exist, they gave no definite answer. They even said that the previous contract must be reviewed before it can take effect. If it is reorganized, the benefits our association has gained through hard work will be in vain. At a time when the cost of living is high and rice is as precious as pearls, how can we survive? This also goes against the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's saying about "supporting the development of agricultural and labor organizations." Therefore, our association dares not reorganize before the labor-management contract is explicitly guaranteed. Unexpectedly, while we were waiting anxiously for orders, six members of the reorganization preparatory committee were suddenly appointed yesterday (the 7th) and immediately took over, which is tantamount to directly dissolving our association and putting our thousands of workers to death. Our association's members, under this order, were panicked. A general meeting of all representatives was convened today, and it was unanimously and firmly resolved to demand guarantees for the previously signed contract until our goal is achieved. We hope that our fellow workers across the country will give us practical assistance. It would be fortunate for the Party and the country, and fortunate for the labor movement. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>▲Statement of Denial of the Preparatory Committee The Shanghai Newspaper Guild Representatives' Meeting issues this statement: It has recently been learned from a notice from the standing committee of the trade union that, following the instructions of the Municipal Party Department, Dai Xingen, Tang Haiquan, Shen Qiutao, Rong Shifu, Wang Changsheng, and Gao Yuancheng have been appointed as members of the preparatory committee for the newspaper industry trade union in the [blank] special district of this city, Xu Zhi as the instructor of the preparatory committee, and Lu Zhongyuan as the secretary of the preparatory committee, with Xu Zhi designated as the convener of the first meeting. In addition to separate orders, this order urgently requires compliance and immediate assumption of duties. Upon hearing this, the representatives of our association were very surprised. During the last talks between the trade union representatives and Guo Yongxi, a representative of the Social Bureau, it was requested that the Social Bureau approve the continued validity of the original contract before reorganization could be dared to proceed. It was hoped that this would be adopted. However, the Party and government organs have not yet provided a clear document, and the Civil Training Committee suddenly ordered reorganization, which was unexpected and caused panic among the people. The representatives all agreed that the labor-management contract is the only lifeline of our workers. Before it is guaranteed by the authorities, it was unanimously resolved not to reorganize and to deny Dai Xingen and others as members of the trade union preparatory committee. In addition to publicizing this, this statement is hereby published in the newspaper to show our seriousness.</p>
<p>▲Letter of Resignation from the Preparatory Committee Dai Xingen and others hereby announce their resignation from the preparatory committee: We, Xingen and others, were appointed by the Municipal Party Department's Order No. 1989 as members of the preparatory committee for the newspaper industry trade union in the Second Special District. We should have immediately taken office to live up to the high expectations. However, according to the resolution of the trade union representatives' meeting, Xingen and others are unanimously denied. We feel that our abilities are weak and we dare not obey the order. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Party Department to return the original letter of appointment, we hereby publish this statement. Dai Xingen, Tang Haiquan, Rong Shifu, and Gao Yuancheng, together.</p>
<p>▲Documents from the Newspaper Guild to the Civil Training Committee Two documents from the Newspaper Guild to the Civil Training Committee of the Municipal Party Department are recorded below: (1) Regarding the matter of submitting a request: In accordance with your committee's Order No. 1989, Dai Xingen, Tang Haiquan, Shen Qiutao, Rong Shifu, Wang Changsheng, and Gao Yuancheng have been appointed as members of the preparatory committee for the newspaper industry trade union in the [blank] special district of this city, Xu Zhi as the instructor of the preparatory committee, and Lu Zhongyuan as the secretary of the preparatory committee, with Xu Zhi designated as the convener of the first meeting. In addition to separate orders, this order urgently requires compliance and immediate assumption of duties. Accordingly, the association immediately convened a meeting of representatives to prepare for reorganization. However, the representatives all believed that they were unwilling to reorganize before the original labor-management contract was clearly guaranteed. Therefore, we are submitting this request to your committee, requesting that the labor-management contract be effectively guaranteed in order to maintain the interests of the workers and facilitate the progress of the reorganization. (2) Regarding the matter of submitting a request: In accordance with your committee's Order No. 1989, Dai Xingen, Tang Haiquan, Shen Qiutao, Rong Shifu, Wang Changsheng, and Gao Yuancheng have been appointed as members of the preparatory committee for the newspaper industry trade union in the Second Special District. In compliance with this, in addition to sending the order to the original persons, it was found that the association could not find Shen Qiutao and Wang Changsheng in the list of members. Therefore, it was impossible to deliver the order. The original order should be returned to your committee for review.</p>
<p>▲Resignation Letter from Rong Shifu and Others Rong Shifu and others submit a letter to the Municipal Civil Training Committee, stating: Regarding the matter of submitting a request, we received your committee's Order No. 1989 yesterday, appointing Rong Shifu, Dai Xingen, Gao Yuancheng, Tang Haiquan, Shen Qiutao, Wang Changsheng, and six others to the preparatory committee for the newspaper industry trade union in the Second Special District of this city. We believe that we lack the knowledge and ability to be competent and must request to resign. We hope that you will approve.</p>
<h3>Bureau Affairs Meeting of the County Construction Bureau</h3>
<p>▲The 24th Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau held its 24th bureau affairs meeting at 2:00 PM on the 6th. Ding Guangzhi, Gong [blank]xing, Wu Mingren, Wan Shaoren, and others attended. Bureau Chief Wu Wenhua chaired the meeting, and Li Tongrui served as the recorder.

(4) Regarding the Zhujiabang River in the Second District, the district previously sent a letter requesting the dispatch of personnel to measure the river. Yesterday, Chief Gong of the Technology Section and Assistant Engineer Wu Naiming were dispatched to the site to insert poles in sections. Construction should start soon. Next, the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the county government's meeting, how should we handle the matter of formulating a plan for the county's afforestation movement? It was resolved that Chief Gong of the Technology Section should handle it. (2) Regarding the letter from the Relocation Design Committee requesting us to formulate the required area of the bureau's houses to facilitate the collection of designs, it was resolved that Wu Naiming should formulate it. (3) The materials for each section of the bureau's annual publication have been collected. How should we review them? It was resolved that each section should review them.</p>

<h3>Visitors from Taiyuan Talk About the Recent Situation in Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>▲Provincial Currency Is the Only Important Key</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, visitors from Taiyuan talked about the recent situation in Shanxi Province as follows: The atmosphere in Shanxi Province has always been known for its simplicity, and social security is relatively stable. However, since the defeat of Yan's army, the remnants of the army have filled the territory, salaries have been in arrears for several months, the financial situation is chaotic, the provincial currency cannot be maintained, the currency price has fallen, and commodity prices have risen. The cost of living is now quite similar to that in Shanghai. Bandits are rampant in rural areas from time to time. The once-regarded peaceful paradise is now showing signs of disturbance. Although Taiyuan is the capital of Shanxi Province, due to its remote location, transportation is blocked, and commerce is not very developed. Recently, affected by military and political affairs and provincial currency, it has been declining day by day. Whether there will be a turnaround in the future depends entirely on whether the central government can deal with the army in the shortest possible time and maintain the provincial currency to make a decision. This is the recent situation in our province. As for the social aspect, the park only has an address and no facilities. The equipment in the public national library is also simple, and there are very few science books. As for theaters, only the cinema is acceptable. Most of the other theaters are simple and crude, and they are mostly old dramas.</p>
<h3>Rental House Tickets Should Be Affixed with Stamps</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to the owners of real estate in this city, stating: Article 2 of the current stamp tax regulations specifies that for documents and rental house tickets for leasing land and houses, those from one yuan or more but less than ten yuan should be affixed with a one-cent stamp, and those ten yuan or more should be affixed with a two-cent stamp. Some of the receipts for monthly rent collected by various shops and residences in this city have not been fully stamped. The Shanghai Special Zone Stamp Tax Office of the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau has sent a letter requesting assistance in persuasion. All business owners are wealthy and understand righteousness. They should fulfill their obligations to the country and will not lag behind. However, fearing that some business owners may not be fully aware of the current regulations, we hereby publish this notice. For monthly rent receipts, please comply with the regulations and affix stamps.</p>
<h3>Police and Security Corps Protect Collectors</h3>
<p>As all the stores in the city are closing, various stores are sending personnel to collect outstanding accounts. The Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Security Corps, fearing that bandits might take the opportunity to rob the collectors of their money, have dispatched patrol teams, armed police, and security corps members to patrol back and forth from today. The Public Security Bureau has also allocated motorcycle patrol teams from various district offices to patrol the streets day and night to maintain local security.</p>
<h3>Anhui Groups Again Request the Abolition of Salt Surtax and Rice License Tax</h3>
<p>The All-Anhui Public Association in Shanghai, the Hui Ning Fellow Association, the Bengbu Grain Industry Association represented by Liu Zhusan, the Huaiyuan Grain Merchant Association represented by Xiang Jingwen, the people of 21 counties in northern Anhui petitioning by Guo Pengzhuoru, the Xiuning Fellow Association, the Shexian Fellow Association, the Wuyuan Fellow Association, the Huoke County Fellow Association, and the Taiping Fellow Association submitted a telegram to Chiang, Chairman of the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, stating: Regarding the matter of establishing names and collecting donations illegally in violation of the law, which harms the Republic of China, we earnestly request that you order the abolition to alleviate the people's suffering. The Anhui Provincial Government has recently added salt tax surcharges and illegally collected rice license taxes. Our associations have previously telegraphed to request their abolition and have personally stated the difficulties faced by our representatives. We are grateful that you have repeatedly telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government to abide by the central government's order to abolish them all. We appreciate that the government (Yuanfu Ministry) loves the people and is sincere. The people of Anhui are deeply grateful and should wait quietly for a solution. How dare we trouble you again? However, according to recent letters and telegrams from public groups and people in northern and southern Anhui, the Anhui Provincial Government has not only failed to comply with the order to abolish the taxes, but has also forcibly collected them by force, posting notices in the thoroughfare, and arresting the main merchants. The merchants are afraid of it, and they will inevitably flee, the situation is tense, and the public is panicked. The central government has repeatedly issued orders after implementing the abolition of the Likin tax, stating that provinces must not establish names and collect all kinds of taxes. It has also assigned the original surcharges on salt to the Ministry of Finance for unified collection. The clear orders are clear and shown to China and abroad. All provinces under the rule of the Party should strictly comply with them to value decrees. However, the Anhui Provincial Government dares to openly disobey and recklessly impose these onerous taxes and donations in the name of provincial defense expenses. Once this trend starts, not only will the people of Anhui suffer from it, but if other provinces follow suit, the impact will be true harm to the Party and the country. Moreover, salt and rice are necessities of life. If heavy taxes are suddenly added, how can it be tolerated? At a time when the cost of living is high and the price of silver is low, if this causes a riot that affects local security, who will be to blame? Thinking of this, we are extremely fearful. The Anhui Provincial Government's measures, which disregard public opinion and do not comply with laws, are clearly undermining unity and harming the Republic of China. We, for the sake of the government's prestige and the interests of the people, dare not remain silent about what we consider dangerous. We respectfully request that you (Yuanfu Ministry) maintain the prestige of the central government, implement the initial purpose of abolishing the Likin tax, and promptly issue a strict order to the Anhui Provincial Government to fundamentally abolish the salt surtax and rice license tax within a specified period, and severely punish all other illegal actions, in order to value the decrees and care for the people's difficulties. It would be truly virtuous and convenient.</p>
<h3>National Goods Association Returns Exhibits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation sent letters to various factories regarding the return of exhibits, stating: Dear Sir, we received a letter from the National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that your association enthusiastically supported the cotton textile exhibition held by our hall, solicited exhibits, and sent them to the exhibition. They were colorful and beautiful. Now that the exhibition period has ended, we have collected the original exhibits, packed them into nine boxes, one box from the Jinlong Carpet Company, one box from the Hongtai Box Factory, one box from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, and one bundle (we have already notified the two factories and the bureau to bring the letter to your association to collect them), a total of thirteen items. We have handed them over to the Huasheng Yiyun Transport Company for delivery and inspection, and please distribute them separately. Please reply. Accordingly, we hereby inform you that please prepare a receipt and send someone to our association to collect them between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM on the 10th of this month (Tuesday).</p>
<h3>The National Goods Industry Agrees to Dredge Shentan</h3>
<p>▲Because the Surcharge Does Not Hinder National Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation sent a letter to the Dredging Bureau, expressing its agreement on the dredging of Shentan. It stated that our association previously sent personnel to attend the meeting, fearing that the dredging of Shentan would increase the burden on the national goods industry, so we advocated slowing down the process. Now, after reading Article 5 of the funding proposal drafted by Tax Commissioner Mei, the proposed dredging surcharge will be fully levied on imported foreign goods. The products shipped to foreign countries and domestic products, as well as various goods transported domestically, will still be collected according to the current method of collecting 3% on the basis of 5% ad valorem. Therefore, the burden on the national goods industry is acceptable, and we express our agreement.</p>

<h3>Bereaved Families of the New Daming Steamer Disaster Flock to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Urging the Handling Lawyers to Resolve the Matter Quickly</p>
<p>▲ Otherwise, a Joint Anti-Japanese Movement Will Be Launched</p>
<p>According to the Riri News, it has been more than three years since the New Daming Steamer disaster occurred. The Japanese side has delayed paying the meager consolation money to the bereaved families that it has already acknowledged. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a public telegram urging the Japanese side to deliver the money as soon as possible, the Japanese side still treats it as a mere formality. However, the bereaved families of the more than 350 people who sacrificed their lives in this case, the surviving members who depend on them for a living, number approximately several thousand. They have been running around and appealing for years, only to find that they have gained nothing. Instead, they have spent money on travel, creating a situation where they cannot live and cannot die. Their difficult situation is truly beyond description. The lack of humanitarianism on the Japanese side is evident. As the Lunar New Year approaches, representatives of the families have recently continued to come to Shanghai, seeking the three lawyers handling the case, Wu Chengyu, Chen Zemin, and Gao Shuo, to demand that they expedite the Japanese side's fulfillment of the settlement agreement. Otherwise, the families will seek assistance from all sectors and the people of the entire country to serve as a backing for the victims and launch an economic boycott against Japan. According to Mr. Pei Jiesan, a member of the bereaved families, if the Japanese side does not sincerely resolve the matter, they plan to organize a New Daming Steamer Disaster Support Association and unite with various disaster groups to launch an anti-Japanese movement and confront Japanese imperial capitalism.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union Approved to Abolish the Contracting System</h3>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union recently proposed measures to abolish the contracting system because contractors colluded with imperialists and capitalists, hiring seamen to be subservient to foreigners and mistreating them. The proposal was submitted to various central departments for review. Now, Instruction No. 12991 of the Central Training Department reads: "The submitted documents regarding the proposed measures to eliminate contractors have been reviewed. The matter has been forwarded to the Ministry of Industry for review. Please be informed." Furthermore, Instruction No. 54 of the Labor Department of the National Government's Ministry of Industry reads: "The case was previously based on a note stating that Chinese laborers on foreign ships were being mistreated by contractors, and requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward a message to the relevant authorities instructing all shipping companies not to use contractors to protect Chinese laborers. The Shanghai Municipal Government was consulted for details on the abuse of sailors by contractors and the use of contractors by foreign ships for review and decision. The union was also instructed to be informed. The Shanghai Municipal Government's response to the ministry was consistent with the facts. In addition to consulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification and handling, the union is hereby instructed to be informed." It is reported that after receiving the order, the union immediately notified all its members to comply and jointly eliminate contractors. This is also a matter of survival for China's 800,000 sailors.</p>
<h3>Salary Dispute with Japanese Shipping Company</h3>
<p>▲ Seamen's Union Sends Letter Requesting Contractual Fulfillment</p>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union, based on a report from Chinese laborers on the Changfeng ship of the Japanese-owned Kawato Company that the manager, Tian Xizhi, owed a large sum of money and delayed payment, immediately ordered a work stoppage to urge his awareness. At that time, the manager and representative Yang Junsheng, along with the Japanese representative of the company, Takeda Kakuchu, rushed to the union overnight to negotiate a resolution. The result of the discussion was an agreement to pay in four installments and not to mistreat workers. Labor and management each signed a contract and kept a copy before work resumed. However, the manager violated the contract and did not pay the owed money, and even attempted to dismiss workers. The union, upon learning of this, sent a letter to the signing parties demanding fulfillment of the contract, which reads: "Respectfully, regarding the owed money to the workers of the Changfeng ship of the Japanese-owned Kawato Company, an agreement was signed by Takeda Kakuchu, Tian Xizhi, Yang Junsheng, and you at the union on November 27th of last year to pay in installments. Each party kept a copy as evidence. Now, according to a report from the ship's workers, the agreement has not been fulfilled. Moreover, due to the suspension of navigation for repairs, the workers are being dismissed on some pretext. Such broken promises and bad faith are already a breach of contract, and now taking the opportunity to dismiss workers is even worse. For the sake of the workers' hard-earned money, our union cannot sit idly by and allow it to be taken away. For the sake of the workers' future and livelihood, we cannot ignore their unemployment. Although you may mistakenly believe that the labor side is powerless and cannot do anything, our comrades are here with a mission from the Central Government to protect sailors. We will certainly do our utmost to mediate and avoid labor disputes. If not, we will report to the Central Government and request the dispatch of personnel to negotiate to ensure that our sailors are freed from oppression. In addition to sending a separate letter, we are hereby informing you. We urge you to fulfill the contract and pay all the owed money to the workers and not to dismiss them without reason in order to maintain your reputation and resolve the situation. We eagerly await your reply."</p>
<h3>Xin'an County Telegraphs About Suffering from War Disaster</h3>
<p>The Red Cross Society of China received a telegram from the Henan Provincial Relief Committee, which reads: "To the Chinese Red Cross Society, according to a report from Cao Lusheng, the Xin'an County Relief Branch, the county has suffered repeated droughts, locust plagues, and constant warfare involving soldiers and bandits. In the seventeenth and eighteenth years, only 30% of the wheat harvest was collected in the autumn, and in the nineteenth year, only 20% was collected. The rice crops withered. Years of war, with Feng's army passing through more than ten times, have imposed harsh demands for funds, grain, fodder, shoes, clothing, conscription, and other expenses, totaling more than seven million. The people are impoverished, and the entire territory is in turmoil. More than 10,000 fierce bandits have gathered, destroying more than 40,000 houses and causing losses of more than eight million in commodity prices. Abductions are rampant, and those unable to pay ransoms have been hanged, tortured with fire, had their hands or waists cut off, and died. Villages are scorched earth, and families are without food. Currently, in addition to the more than 40,000 people who have fled without a trace, there are 29,000 people waiting for death and rescue. The situation is dire, and we are deeply concerned about the suffering of the hungry and drowning. Our ability to provide relief is exhausted. We implore you to provide assistance." Zhang Fangyou of the Relief Committee.</p>
<h3>Jishihui's Winter Relief Summary in Beiping</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jishihui received a letter yesterday from Director She Juisheng of the Tianjin Relief Office and Director Zhou Jingfu of the Beiping Relief Office, stating that 4,000 more sets of newly made relief clothing had been prepared in Beiping and selectively distributed. Together with the previous allocation, there were a total of 12,000 sets. Although the number is not small, the number of disaster victims is very large and insufficient. They requested further fundraising for relief. The urgent relief in Xuanhua has been handled by Yi Junjinquan and his relief friends. However, the previously determined relief funds of 16,000 yuan are insufficient, and at least another 40 yuan is required. The 20,000 yuan of Tianjin relief funds sent this time has been received and allocated for the cost of relief clothing, the first batch of relief funds for Xuanhua, the fifth batch of porridge factory expenses outside Chaoyangmen, and the expenses for Xiong Binglao to care for disaster-stricken children. There are not many relief funds left. Winter relief is underway and urgently needs funding. We hope for continued fundraising and allocation. The porridge factory at No. 7 Hutong, Jishikou, outside Chaoyangmen in the eastern suburbs of Beiping, sent a report stating that the daily number of people eating porridge is 2,440. More than ten supervisors, including Supervising Officer Wang Yutian and Inspector Zhang Wenyuan, are checking and supervising the distribution at the factory every day. Although the number of people in the three porridge factories in Shucun, Lan, and Baiyian is slightly smaller than that outside Chaoyangmen, it will gradually increase during this severe winter. We hope that clothing and funds will be added at any time to help those suffering from hunger and cold and those who are desperately in need. This is what we hope for from the great benefactors.</p>

<h3>The Last Day of the Samsung Plum Blossom Troupe</h3>
<p>Today is the last day of the Samsung Grand Stage, presenting the masterpieces of the Plum Blossom Troupe, "The Seven Emotions" and "The Person Not Seen Last Year," starring Qian Zhongxiu. Ms. Qian's performance was full of reluctance and sadness, which was conveyed through her singing, earning many tears from the audience. It was not easy. The troupe's address is being relocated from today to No. 572, opposite the Football Field on Rue Pére Robert, as the current location is insufficient. From the 15th of this month, the entire troupe will go to the capital to perform for ten days at the Nanjing Grand Theater.</p>
<h3>The Zhongxi Pharmacy Has Not Yet Been Attached</h3>
<p>▲ Execution May Be Suspended</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was rumored that the Shanghai Special District Court, at the request of the creditor group of the Riye Bank and the Dashijie Savings Department, had attached the Zhizulu and various companies belonging to the Gongfa Company. It was said that the Zhongxi Pharmacy would also be attached. However, according to yesterday's news, the creditor group believed that if the pharmacy were also attached, it would inevitably affect the pharmacy's business, which would indirectly be unfavorable to the creditor. Therefore, the attachment of the pharmacy may be suspended.</p>
<h3>Dockworkers Accused of Price Dispute</h3>
<p>Shi Afu, Chen Chenfu, Tang Ayi, and more than ten other dockworkers at the Huangpu Nanzhao Merchant Bureau Wharf in the French Concession were accused of fighting with the Zhao Merchant Bureau patrolmen over a price increase a few days ago, and tearing the patrolman's uniform. After the police learned of this, they immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to the scene and arrested Shi and others. The rest fled. Shi and others were taken to the police station and sent to the French Court for investigation. The plaintiff, the Zhao Merchant Bureau patrolman, first complained that the defendants and others had gathered a crowd to commit violence because their request for a price increase was not granted, and asked for an investigation. Shi Afu and others confessed that it was customary for civilians to charge six yuan per package. On the previous day, the Zhao Merchant Bureau staff agreed to add one steel yuan, but then suddenly denied it, so there was a dispute, but they dared not commit violence. The other confessions were vague. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced each of the defendants to one week in jail as a warning.</p>

<h3>Patrolman An Zhendong of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau Was Assassinated Last Night</h3>
<p>▲ Ambushed on a Bicycle by an Enemy</p>
<p>▲ Shot Three Times and Died on the Spot</p>
<p>An Zhendong, a patrolman at the Tanjiqiao branch of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, was ambushed by an enemy around 6:30 p.m. last night while riding his bicycle from the station near Zhijiang Temple Road on Gonghe Xin Road. He was shot in a vital area and collapsed to the ground, dying on the spot. After learning of this, Qu, the district chief of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, immediately sent personnel to investigate. The reason for the murder is unknown.</p>
<p>▲ Ambushed by an Enemy Since the establishment of the Tanjiqiao branch of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, it has been a short time. There are currently about 20 police officers, led by Patrolman An Zhendong. Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 p.m., an old man came to the station to deliver a letter, which was addressed to Patrolman An. After An received the letter, he left alone on his bicycle after 6:30 p.m. Unexpectedly, several people suddenly appeared behind him near Zhijiang Temple Road on Gonghe Xin Road and shot An in the back. At that time, An was outnumbered and unable to resist. He fell beside the car.</p>
<p>▲ Seriously Injured and Died The scene of the incident was about one li away from the Tanjiqiao branch station and was extremely remote, so no one knew about it. Later, a girl passed by and saw An lying on the ground, motionless for a long time. She ran to tell the police officers, and Wang, the patrol leader of the branch station, immediately led the police to check. They saw Patrolman An lying face down on the ground, with his head facing north and his feet facing south. The bicycle was overturned on the side of the road. They sent An to the Pushen Hospital on Xinmin Road. After a medical examination, it was discovered that there were three gunshot wounds, two in the back and one in the finger. He was already dead when he arrived at the hospital due to excessive injuries and could not be saved.</p>
<p>▲ Received a Letter An Zhendong seemed to be in a hurry when he went out, and he did not specify the destination. However, it was found afterward that there was a letter, which was delivered at around 5:00 p.m. The letter was addressed to Jiangxing Hotel, and the sender was Wang Houzhai, who lived upstairs in the Yida meat shop on Caishi Street in the French Concession. The letter invited An to a mahjong game before 7:00 p.m. There was nothing else of importance. It is unknown whether it is related to this case. When An left, he was wearing a felt hat and a short blue cloth uniform with a thick wool coat. There was a bullet hole on the edge of the felt hat.</p>
<p>▲ Impoverished After His Death The deceased was 44 years old, from Dongguang, Zhili. He had served in the Public Security Bureau for many years. Before serving as the patrolman of the Fourth District, he served as a patrol leader in the Security Team. He was promoted to patrolman because of his diligent service. He left behind a wife and two daughters, and the situation was quite impoverished. The eldest daughter is only seven years old, and the second is three years old. Qu, the district chief of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, has instructed all officers and police to pay attention to arresting the murderer.</p>
<h3>Two More Men Commit Suicide in Huizhong Hostel</h3>
<p>▲ Same Poisoning as the Previous Two Women</p>
<p>▲ Can Be Said to Be Ill-fated Lovers</p>
<p>A suicide by poisoning occurred in room 243 of the Xinhuaizhong Hostel on Hankou Road the other day (5th). The details have been recorded in this newspaper. However, the surnames of the two women and the truth about why they committed suicide have not been revealed to date. Unexpectedly, at noon yesterday at about 12 o'clock, two young men committed suicide together by poisoning in room 341 of the hostel. Upon hearing the news, the reporter found it strange that it was not unique. Unexpectedly, at about 8 o'clock last night, this newspaper suddenly received a letter, which was the suicide note of the two young men. The surnames and reasons for the suicide of the two women were also revealed as a result.</p>
<p>▲ Two Men Check In At about 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, two young men in western suits suddenly arrived at the Xinhuaizhong Hostel on Hankou Road. The waiter led them to the third floor and opened room 341. On the guest list, they signed Zhou Erlang and Zhou Sanlang, aged 27 and 29 respectively, from Beiping, students. After the room was arranged, the two went out again and returned at about 10 p.m. After the tea boy finished serving tea, the two closed the door, looking like long-distance travelers who were exhausted from the journey and eager to rest.</p>
<p>▲ Both Men Died At about 12 noon yesterday, the tea boy saw that the guest in that room had not gotten up yet, and there was no movement in the room. He knocked on the door and called, but no one answered. The tea boy was more suspicious, so he gathered his companions and tried to pry open the door. The two were already lying stiff on the bed. Feeling them, they were already ice-cold. Looking at the table, there were two empty medicine bottles placed there. He quickly ran to report to the accounting room and relayed the report to the Laozha patrol station. Upon hearing the news, the patrol leader immediately instructed detectives to investigate and took the bodies to the Feilun Road morgue for examination.</p>
<p>▲ Names of Men and Women At about 9 o'clock last night, just as the reporter was about to go to investigate upon hearing the news, he suddenly received a letter written on the letterhead of the Shanghai Bairi Film Co., Ltd., with two cards attached. One was "Wang Tianlong, manager of the Bairi Film Company, 637 Gansu Road, Qipulu, American Concession" and the other was "Zhang Yongkang, assistant manager of the Bairi Film Company," with the same address as Wang Tianlong. There was also a group photo of one man and two women with the words "This person is Qiu Shufang, the beloved wife of the unknown Wang Tianlong. This person is Zhou Lang Wang Tianlong, who committed suicide at Huizhong 341 on the 7th. This person is Ms. Li Chen Shaoying, who committed suicide with Qiu at Huizhong on the 4th," and other words written on the back.</p>
<p>▲ Suicide Note The original letter was written in pencil and contained some errors, which are transcribed as follows: "To the respected sir: I am writing to inform you that I read in the Times that my beloved wife Qiu Shufang, from Suzhou, is 25 years old this year. Ms. Li is a false name, her real name is Chen Shaoying, from Ningbo, 22 years old this year. The two of them are very righteous, although they cannot live together, they are willing to die together, eat at the same table every day, and sleep in the same bed every night. Because Qiu Shufang and Wang Tianlong are married, the two of them are well-matched and have a very strong sense of loyalty. The couple went to Suzhou and Nanjing last month to withdraw money, but met bandits on the way and robbed them of more than 2,700 yuan in silver notes. They did not want to move forward because of the environment, so they committed suicide. Wang Tianlong is 27 years old this year, and Zhang Yongkang is 32 years old this year. The Bairi Film Company established by them was robbed of the money for filming, so my beloved wife could not bear it, and Zhang of the company could not maintain it. We two (Zhang) (Wang) cannot live together, but we are willing to die together. But we four men and women value each other the most in the world, so it is best to commit suicide together. Because of the things in my heart, I want to go to meet my beloved wife and righteous sister, so I cannot say more. Please ask the gentleman to inquire at Bairi or the Dongchang Hostel in the French Concession. Written by Wang Tianlong, recorded by Zhang Yongkang at Huizhong Hostel 341, February 7th, 9 p.m."</p>
<p>▲ Lived in Dongchang The reporter also inquired at the Dongchang Hostel in the French Concession because the letter contained the words "also inquire at the Dongchang Hostel in the French Concession," but the address was not specified. After checking the telephone directory, the Dongchang Hostel was indeed located in Wufeng Lane near Avenue Joffre and Route Luba. According to the hostel clerk, a young man in western clothes did come on the 2nd of this month. He signed Wang, 28 years old, from Fengtian, a student, and stayed in room 26 upstairs. The room fee was agreed at seven jiao and seven fen per day. He stayed for a total of three days and paid only one yuan. He lived alone on the first night, and a young woman came on the second night. She also signed Wang, 25 years old, from Changzhou. The two lived together for two nights. On the 5th, the man and woman went out together and never returned.</p>
<p>▲ Reasons for Suicide According to the letter, the two women who died earlier were Qiu Shufang and Chen Shaoying, and the two men who died yesterday were Wang Tianlong and Zhang Yongkang. As for the reasons for the joint suicide of the four, the letter stated that they were robbed of more than 2,700 yuan in silver notes by bandits, which forced them to this point. However, according to the speculation of onlookers, there may be other reasons involved. This is recorded in order to observe what happens next.</p>
<h3>Zhou Tingfa, a Fireman on the Train, Was Chopped Six Times with an Axe</h3>
<p>▲ Returning Home After a Banquet at the Hongyunlou</p>
<p>▲ Zhu Jinyuan Failed to Sell Opium</p>
<p>Zhou Tingfa, 27 years old, from Changzhou, who lives at No. 27 in Zhongde Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, and works as a fireman on the train, went to a friend's banquet at the Hongyunlou on Avenue Dubail at 7 p.m. last night. At about 10:30 p.m., when the banquet ended and the guests all made plans to return home, they bid farewell to the host. Zhou followed the crowd out of the restaurant and had not walked a few steps when several thugs suddenly rushed out from the side of the road and held Zhou down. At an alleyway, they took out axes and chopped Zhou's left leg four times, his right hand once, and his buttocks once. Blood flowed freely, and he collapsed to the ground. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs each ran away. Afterward, Zhou got up with his injuries, hired a streetcar, and took himself to the Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital then reported to the Dazimingzhong patrol station, which ordered detectives to investigate and arrest the culprits. According to Zhou, one of the thugs, named Zhu Jinyuan, who specializes in selling opium and often travels on the Shanghai-Nanjing railway, can be identified. A few days ago, he hid more than 1,000 yuan worth of opium in the locomotive, but it was discovered by the inspectors. Later, the goods were confiscated, and he was wrongly acquitted. This time, he gathered a crowd to commit revenge, fearing that he suspected Zhou of instigating the exposure.</p>
<h3>Panic over Road Construction and Demolition of Shen Family Houses in the City Center</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has designated the southern part of Yin Hang Township as the city center and is now vigorously constructing roads with all efforts. It is reported that the municipal government housing will begin construction on July 1st. The Sanmin Road trunk road from Zhabei to the city center has already begun construction. The width of the road surface is 60 meters, or about 20 zhang. However, due to the need to take a straight path, many village houses along the route must be demolished. In the Shenjia Homestead, located half a li north of Shenjiahang, there are more than 30 farming households. Their houses are all on the road surface and must be demolished, totaling more than 50 rooms, leaving very little. It's almost like moving the entire village. Because of this, the villagers are in a panic. Previously, when surveying the land, it was impossible to inquire accurately, resulting in no way to appeal. Only after the stone boundary markers were erected did construction begin. The farmers then sent a letter signed by Shen Yangsheng and Shen Xiquan, stating that they moved here from Gaoqiao in Pudong during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Therefore, the entire village is surnamed Shen, with no other surnames intermingling. Because they were born poor, there are no wealthy families. If they are forced to demolish and move, they will not only have no money but also no land to accommodate them. Because the municipal government's planned trunk roads, branch roads, and sub-roads in the area number in the dozens, no one nearby dares to build temporary shelters to live in. Also, an elderly woman surnamed Shi in Dongshijia Bridge, over seventy years old, whose husband died early, has only one son who is not yet of age. They originally planned to get married during the spring season according to the lunar calendar. However, their house also needs to be demolished. Upon hearing the news, the old woman has already developed severe neurological symptoms, crying and laughing uncontrollably, a truly tragic sight.</p>
<h3>Huangpu Bridge Construction: Preparation for Redrawing Detailed Plans</h3>
<p>Regarding the construction of an iron bridge over the Huangpu River, because the original plans were too simple, the municipal government has approved an order to submit detailed information. According to Gong Zhengfang, a member of the Huangpu River Iron Bridge Construction Committee, in an interview with the Xin Sheng News Agency, the current initiative to build the Pudong Iron Bridge is not only to facilitate transportation between Pudong and Puxi in a narrow sense, but also to open up the city, lay tram lines, connect the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and develop commercial transportation, among other facilities, in a broader sense. Currently, all the materials for the bridge have been contracted with the German Meng-A-En Bridge Company and the Hope Steel Factory, guaranteed by the Continental Banking Group. This group invests heavily in industries in Europe and the United States and has a good reputation in Hong Kong for managing overseas Chinese investment projects. The factory has accepted this guarantee with confidence. The original plans submitted to the municipal government are now being redrawn in detail by the factory in accordance with the order and submitted to the committee for review before being submitted to the municipal government for adoption. This project is extremely important for building a new Greater Shanghai and developing the commercial market in Pudong. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Record of a Robbery in Miaogangzhai, Dachang Temple</h3>
<p>▲ Surrounding the Entire House and Searching Separately</p>
<p>▲ The Victim is Placed in a Wok and Burned</p>
<p>Three major robbery cases have occurred in Miaogangzhai in Jusa Thirty-Three Tu, northeast of Dachang Town, Baoyi County, and in Yanghuanqiao Tangxi Shenjiagou. Special supplementary notes are as follows. On the night of the 29th of last month, more than 40 bandits suddenly arrived at Miaogangzhai, each holding pistols, Mauser pistols, and iron and wooden sticks as weapons. They first surrounded the house, not allowing anyone to enter or leave, and then searched separately. More than ten families in the entire house were not spared. Among them, the Yang Zhengxiang family suffered the most, with clothes and silver dollars worth about 700 yuan being robbed, totaling about 3,000 yuan. After the group was full, they roared and fled south. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, the bandits arrived for the second time, using the same method to surround and rob the Yanghuanqiao and Tangxi Shenjiagou houses. Starting from the Zhang Lianghou family in the house and searching to the Zhang family at the west end, they saw that the house was very new and assumed it was a wealthy household. They immediately forced Zhang to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Zhang handed over twelve dollars from his pocket, saying that this was all he had, for use during the New Year, and that there was definitely no silver elsewhere, and they could search as much as they wanted. Unexpectedly, the bandits did not believe him. One bandit ordered torture, and the bandits immediately took action, stripping the victim of his clothes and pants, heating up a wok, pressing the person into the wok, and then burning him with firewood, called "Hanta Cake," a cruel and poisonous method unheard of in ancient times. In total, thirty-odd households were robbed in the three villages twice, with losses amounting to several thousand gold. Now, families with a little surplus in the area have moved to other places to take refuge, while poor families are worried day and night. Later, Zhang Lianghou and others submitted a petition to the Dachang District Office, which was forwarded to the Baoshan County Government, ordering the defense groups of the four towns of Dachang, Jiangwan, and Hujiazhuang Xitangjiaqiao to conduct patrols every night. Unexpectedly, the bandits carried out a third robbery the night before last. Fortunately, members of the Dachang Defense Group arrived and opened fire, scaring the bandits away, thus avoiding a scare, but it was still dangerous.</p>
<h3>Bandits Mistakenly Rob Poor Farmers</h3>
<p>▲ Instead Give the Victim Two Dimes</p>
<p>Wang Baofeng, a farmer from Dongwangzhai, five or six li northeast of Jiangwan, is 53 years old. His family consists only of himself and his wife, Liu, and they have no children. They make a living by farming and are extremely poor, often struggling to make ends meet. Unexpectedly, around midnight the night before last, five bandits speaking with northern accents suddenly visited their home to rob them. Wang and his wife were already fast asleep when the bandits broke open the door and entered. The two were awakened from their dreams in shock. One bandit immediately pulled out a pistol, forbidding them from making any noise, while the other bandits ransacked the house. However, Wang's family was utterly destitute, with nothing of value. Therefore, the bandits searched for a long time without finding anything. One of the leading bandits then held a gun to Wang, coercing him to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Wang and Liu immediately begged bitterly, telling him that they truly had no possessions. The bandits did not believe them, saying, "We have long heard of your Wang Laosan's wealthy reputation. Don't lie to us. Quickly hand it over neatly, or the bullets won't spare you." After hearing the bandits' words, Wang and his wife realized that they had been robbed by mistake. They then told the truth, stating that their real name was Wang Baofeng and not Wang Laosan. The bandits initially did not believe them, but then asked if this was Xiwangjiazhai. Wang told them that it was Dongwangjiazhai. The bandits then suddenly understood, looking at each other and laughing silently. The leading bandit took out two dimes from his pocket and gave them to Wang, saying, "You old man are truly unbelievably poor. We took the wrong path tonight. We are very sorry. These two dimes are for you to buy wine to drink tomorrow." After saying this, they left noisily.</p>
<h3>Explosion of an Electrical Box: Xing Heshang Dies</h3>
<p>▲ Lower Jaw, Left Arm, and Back of Head Blown Off</p>
<p>Xing Heshang, a local, is 25 years old and lives in a bungalow in Xingjiazhai at the end of North Sichuan Road. He has been working as an electrician at the Japanese electric light shop at No. 137 Doulean Road for more than ten years. He is diligent and frugal, and is quite favored by the Japanese owner. At 12:30 yesterday afternoon, Xing was assembling a dry battery box in the shop. The box contained a carbonaceous mixture (a type of chemical raw material) when it suddenly exploded, blowing off Xing's lower jaw, left arm, and several places on the back of his head. Blood gushed out like a spring, and he died shortly after. The shop owner immediately reported to the Japanese detectives, and the body was sent to Tongren Hospital by car, then transferred to the Forensic Examination Office on Ferren Road to await examination.</p>
<h3>More Problems Arise for Zhu Mintang's Two Women</h3>
<p>▲ Zhao Xiuzhen Actually Gives Birth to a Son</p>
<p>▲ Li Xiujuan Proposes Three Conditions</p>
<p>Zhu Mintang, a former comprador of Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co., was sued by a dancer named Zhao Xiuzhen last autumn for seducing her, causing her to become pregnant, and then abandoning her, which attracted considerable attention in society. Later, the case was settled out of court. Zhu's father then took Xiuzhen back to his ancestral home in Ningbo. Before long, Xiuzhen gave birth to a son, which greatly pleased Zhu's parents. However, Zhu's legal wife, Li Xiujuan, who was newly married, became estranged from him after learning that her husband was in love with Zhao. The couple originally lived on Lafayette Road in the French Concession, but then moved to Anlefang on Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, Zhu has become increasingly cold towards Xiujuan, often not returning home for several days. Last month, he also terminated the lease on the Anlefang house and lodged at the Great China Hotel, forcing Xiujuan to return to Ningbo to live with Xiuzhen. Xiujuan then proposed three conditions: (1) If she is to return to Ningbo, Zhu should sever his relationship with Xiuzhen; (2) Xiuzhen's son should only be given gifts from the inheritance in the future and not be allowed to inherit it; (3) Zhu Mintang should not take any more concubines in the future. If Zhu agrees to each condition, she will go to Ningbo with him. Zhu then invited relatives to mediate, but no agreement has been reached. Li Xiujuan fears that after the breakup, litigation will be inevitable, and she has already hired a lawyer to prepare everything.</p>
<h3>A Poor Mistress Cannot Endure for Long</h3>
<p>▲ Tan Jiajun Catches the Adulterous Couple</p>
<p>Tan Jiajun, who runs a public stove shop on Xinjiaxing Road in Hongzhen, his wife, Tan Liu, 26 years old, suddenly fell in love with his partner, Huang Xiaosizi. In January of last year, Tan found out about it and fired Huang. However, the woman could not bear to abandon her love and abandoned her status as a shop owner to elope with the poor and destitute Huang Xiaosizi, willing to share joys and sorrows. However, Tan was very unwilling and sent out scouts everywhere, hoping to capture his wife. Unexpectedly, the couple had fled to Gaoyou, so there was nowhere to search. Recently, Huang and his mistress were living in the countryside, unable to make a living, and then came to Shanghai again, living near Hujiaqiao. Tan found out and filed a complaint with the Third Precinct of the Fifth District yesterday. He was dispatched by the police to capture the adulterous couple and transfer them to the local court for questioning.</p>
<h3>A Widow Yearns for Her Children</h3>
<p>▲ But Also Cannot Bear to Part with Her Lover</p>
<p>Huang _, 54 years old, from Wenzhou, is currently a secretary at the Ningbo Public Security Bureau. His family lives at No. 1177 Renshouli, Pei'er Road, Tilanqiao, Hongkou. He has two sons, Jinchong and Jinming. His elder son's wife, Zhou, 32 years old, has one son and one daughter. The son is now twelve years old and the daughter is fourteen. Jinchong passed away in 1926. The widow, Zhou, observed mourning and raised the orphans, without any other intentions. Unexpectedly, she recently became acquainted with Yang Xiangxi, who makes redwood furniture at No. 2 Deyuli, Catholic Church Street. At first, it was clandestine. However, Zhou loved her children very much and declared to Yang that he could only cohabit if he could afford to support the three of them. Yang agreed, and on January 23, she took her children and fled without a trace. Huang _ loved his grandchildren very much and came to Shanghai to search everywhere. Until yesterday, he learned that Yang Xiangxi, a fellow villager, had hidden them at No. 9 Bingyuli, Zhonghua Road. He went to search around 1:00 PM, and unexpectedly met them on the way. He immediately handed them over to the Second Precinct of the Second District. After interrogation by Director Zhang, Huang _ stated that since Zhou was willing to live with Yang Xiangxi, he would not force her. However, she must return his grandson and granddaughter. According to Zhou's statement, the children were born to her and must be raised to adulthood before being returned to the Huang family. Director Zhang believed that Yang Xiangxi's abduction involved a criminal matter, while Huang _'s claim for the return of his grandchildren and granddaughters was a civil matter, both of which concerned the judiciary, and ordered them to be transferred to the local court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Stalls on Yongxing Road Ordered to Relocate by a Deadline</h3>
<p>The southern section of Gonghe New Road in Zhabei is becoming increasingly prosperous, with numerous shops and dense residential areas. However, there is no small market building, so a group of vegetable vendors set up stalls on the sidewalks along the road to sell their goods. Previously, because Public Bus Lines No. 2 and 3 operated in the area, the company requested and was approved by the Fourth District Public Security Bureau to move all the vegetable stalls to Yongxing Road, Taiyang Temple Road, and Jingjiang Road. However, Yongxing Road and Gonghe New Road are major thoroughfares with the most vehicles and pedestrians, and the vegetable stalls are more concentrated there than elsewhere. Moreover, the stallholders have gradually become accustomed to it, and stalls have gradually been set up on both sides of Gonghe New Road, which was discovered by the Health Bureau. The bureau considered that the vegetable stalls were cluttered, not only detracting from the city's appearance but also greatly hindering traffic. Therefore, it requested the Fourth District Public Security Bureau to move the vegetable stalls on the section of Yongxing Road and Gonghe New Road to Taiyang Temple Road and Jingjiang Road for business (since there are no buses passing through there). District Chief Qu has approved the request and has ordered the relocation several times. However, the stallholders believe that relocation will harm their business, so they are all waiting and watching. It is reported that the stallholders have requested to be allowed to sell until the end of the lunar year. Considering the difficulties of doing business, District Chief Qu has limited the stalls to be set up until the end of February, and they must all be relocated by March 1st.</p>
<h3>Tenant Dispute in Fengyuli, French Concession</h3>
<p>▲ Housing Association Issues Notice to Stop Signing Contracts</p>
<p>Riri News reports that the houses in Fengyuli on Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession, totaling more than 100 buildings, are rental properties built by a person surnamed Wang from Ningbo, managed by Huifu Company. The monthly rent for each building is around 26 yuan, which is already too high according to market prices. The tenants did not advocate for rent reduction because the landlord did not raise the rent. Unexpectedly, after the death of the main landlord last year, there was a proposal to have the tenants sign new contracts. The proposal was rejected by all the tenants. Now, the company has suddenly changed its name to Dali and has resurrected the old plan. The tenants have organized a union and requested assistance from the French Concession Tenant Association. In addition to notifying the tenants to stop signing contracts, the French Housing Association will hold a general meeting to discuss fundamental countermeasures. The notice is recorded as follows: Regarding the matter of notification, it has been approved that the tenants of Fengyuli on Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession have reported to the association that the landlord, Huifu Company, forced tenants to sign contracts last year, with a term of one year, hoping to renegotiate the rent after the expiration, which is actually a disguised form of rent increase. The matter has been reported to your association, and you have opposed it based on the situation, but it has not been implemented. Now, the landlord is still falsely changing the company name to Dali, and all contractors, whether they have signed or not, must go to the company to revise their contracts after receiving the circular, etc. After reviewing it, it is nothing more than a resurgence of old habits. Our tenants all believe that in the current difficult situation, it is difficult to maintain the original rent, and tenants elsewhere are demanding rent reductions. However, the landlord in this area is creating this untimely harsh rule. Your association should find ways to stop it in order to stabilize the people's hearts and maintain livelihoods. We hereby notify all tenants not to be fooled and to stop signing contracts. It is what we hope for. In addition to setting a date for a meeting to discuss countermeasures, this notice is specially issued for your public inspection. Shanghai French Concession Tenant Association respectfully announces.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Involving Accomplices Transferred to Fengxian</h3>
<p>▲ Jiang Huanzhang, Chen Sishan</p>
<p>Xuducun, belonging to Fengxian County, is a very remote place, so the kidnappers organized a base there to hide the hostages, thinking they could avoid the attention of the military police. However, after a long time, the matter was exposed. The Fengxian Public Security Bureau dispatched a team to suppress and capture two kidnappers, Hu Dengkui and Jiang Dahua, and rescued five kidnapped Kunshan wealthy households, including Wang Bingsheng. According to the kidnappers' confessions, Jiang Huanzhang, who lives in Xiaoshadu in Shanghai, and Chen Sishan (also known as Zhang Dakuaitou) in Yichang Road are all accomplices. A special inspector was sent to Shanghai to work with the police to arrest Zhang and Chen and take them to the Shanghai Special District Court to await clarification and to investigate whether they were related to the kidnapping of Ding Ziren, the manager of Fuxin Flour Mill. It is now known that after investigation by the police, no active evidence has been found. Therefore, the connection between Ding's kidnapping and Jiang and Chen cannot be proven. However, they did participate in the kidnappings in Kunshan. After receiving a report from its subordinate Public Security Bureau, the Fengxian County Government immediately prepared a document and sent Inspector Chen Chaogui and _ Wen to Shanghai to request the transfer. Judge Cheng Shangfeng ordered the two bandits to be brought to court for preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the police did not object to the extradition request from the inland government, but the court could decide. The defendant Jiang Huanzhang hired a lawyer to defend himself, saying that the Kunshan kidnappings took place on January 23, 24, and 25. At this time, Jiang was still working as a helmsman on the Luo Caiji ship and did not participate in the kidnapping. Judge Cheng then questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be taken to Fengxian by the officials to be tried in the case.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Hold Memorial Service for Zhu Chengzhang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, various organizations held a memorial service for Mr. Zhu Chengzhang at the YMCA. More than 500 people attended, including Chu Minyi, Sun Fuyi, Huang Mingdao, and Xu Ji_.

Afterwards, Pastor Xiu Zhongcheng gave a blessing, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Judgment in the Case of a British Man Assaulting a Chinese Policeman</h3>
<p>▲ 14 Days of Detention with Hard Labor</p>
<p>British unemployed seaman Holt Croft assaulted a Chinese policeman, No. 2201, almost to the point of unconsciousness in a certain alley on Huaji Road in Hongkou on the 4th of this month, along with an unknown Westerner. A passerby arrested Holt, while the other escaped. Later, Chief Detective Ma Liao from the Huisi Police Station filed a lawsuit in the British Consular Police Court. The court opened recently. The questioner clarified the situation of the Chinese policeman that day, and the doctor proved the injuries. The defendant claimed to be drunk and said that the unknown drinking companion did it. The questioner sentenced him to 14 days of imprisonment with hard labor.</p>
<h3>Refugees Committing Robbery Transferred to the Court</h3>
<p>A large group of male and female refugees suddenly arrived in Shaluxiang, Maqiao (Sixth District), in the county, forcibly demanding money and rice, causing constant disturbances. Later, the refugees saw that the He Xu family was very wealthy and seized the opportunity to rush in and seize whatever they wanted. At that time, the villagers could not stop them and had to let them escape. Afterwards, the victim opened a list and reported to the police regiment to request an arrest. The Second Branch of the County Public Security Bureau arrested three refugees who committed the robbery, Chen Hanxing, Chen Wangshi, and Chen Huangshi, and sent police to search the refugees' boat, seizing 140 to 150 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars, as well as gold rings and gauze trousers. They were submitted to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau for investigation. Suddenly, Chen Zichun, claiming to be a representative of the refugees, submitted a report to the bureau, stating that they were fleeing famine from Hubei and were not bandits. All the seized silver dollars and clothing were their own and requested to be released and given to them. The bureau summoned the original suspects and the representative for repeated interrogation. The victim proved that a pair of gauze trousers was indeed stolen. The inquirer learned the truth and sentenced the defendants and the representative to be detained. He then reported the situation to Director Yan Jian for approval. He considered that the refugees gathered in crowds under the pretense of begging and seized the opportunity to rob, which was no different from theft. If they were not severely punished, how could they be warned and ensure local security? Therefore, in addition to transferring the case to the local court for trial in accordance with the law, he also issued an order to all branches to immediately expel any refugees arriving in the territory in the future and not allow them to stay.</p>

<h3>Recent News on Fundraising by the Alumni Association of National Southeast University, National Central University, and National Higher Normal School</h3>
<p>News of the construction of a clubhouse by the Alumni Association of National Southeast University, National Central University, and National Higher Normal School has been previously reported. It has recently been learned that the association's members are making great efforts to raise funds. The fundraising booklets (ten sheets), donation receipt slips (five books, twenty-five sheets), and donation register receipt slips (one book, ten sheets) for one hundred fundraising team leaders have been completely sent out. Approximately each team leader must solicit at least five fundraisers. The fundraisers receive a certain number of fundraising booklets and donation receipt slips from the team leader and then begin fundraising. The scope of fundraising is not limited by region and is not limited to graduates (each graduate is hoped to donate five yuan). The teachers and staff of the schools, current students, and those with a significant relationship with the schools' teachers and students will also be asked to donate. When the fundraiser receives a donation, the first sheet of the donation receipt slip is given to the donor. At the same time, the second sheet is sent with the donation to the Bank of Communications on Zhongzheng Street in Nanjing, where the bank stamps it and sends it back. The third sheet is sent to the team leader. The remittance fee for the remittance can be deducted from the donated funds. The association has over two thousand members scattered across the country and abroad, making it difficult to send letters to everyone. It is said that advertisements will soon be published in major newspapers in Nanjing and elsewhere to attract the attention of graduates and to solicit more team leaders.</p>

<h3>Account of the Lingnan and Zhenru Basketball Teams' Expedition to the Philippines (8)</h3>
<p>(Report from our correspondent Wenchu in Manila, dated January 28th)</p>
<p>Basketball Loss to the All-Star Team ▲ Crushing Defeat of 65 to 31 丨 Fifth Match 丨</p>
<p>January 27th, 8 PM, was the fifth battle for the Zhenru Basketball Team. Their opponent was the All-Philippine All-Star Team. The result was 65 to 31, a loss to the enemy. A description of the battle is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The So-Called All-Philippine All-Star Team</p>
<p>Consists primarily of the basketball team members who attended the 9th Far Eastern Games, and selects outstanding players from various schools to form an army. The strength of their combat power goes without saying.</p>
<p>▲ Slight Advantage in the Initial Battle</p>
<p>As the whistle blew, both sides did their best in offense and defense. The ball flew east and west, before being seized by the enemy's center, who made a long shot from the right, which missed. The enemy's left forward then jumped up and caught it. Kong Guangyi stepped forward to try to take it, but was dodged, and the enemy turned and shot the ball. The scoreboard then boldly displayed the All-Star team gaining two points. After a while, the enemy's left forward committed a foul by pushing Wei Haiqing, who was given a free throw. Two attempts, two hits, and the score was tied at two. They quickly gained a six to five advantage.</p>
<p>▲ The Enemy's Aggressive Advance</p>
<p>The enemy's right forward scored two consecutive goals. Our side requested a timeout, and Yang Linmin replaced Cai Rongrui. The Philippine center then scored another goal. Their left guard committed a foul, and Yang took the free throw, hitting one of two shots. At this time, the score was seven to eleven. The enemy's left guard fouled again, and Wei made both free throws. Taking advantage of this opportunity, our army fought hard, but the enemy's forwards and guards were very active, with long and short shots all hitting the mark. After they scored eight consecutive goals, Yang Linmin finally scored one goal, and Wei also scored one goal from Zhang Qiying's pass, making the score 27 to 12. At this point, the enemy again displayed their prowess, with effective passing by the forwards, achieving success every time. The score gap widened further and further, from 27 to 12 to a sudden 38 to 12. Wei, taking advantage of a free throw, only made one of two shots, while the enemy's left forward scored another goal. As the first half was about to end, Zhang Qiying made a long shot from 15 yards on the left side, hitting the basket with great precision, which was enough to boost morale. However, the whistle blew for the end of the first half. The enemy scored 40 points, and our side scored 15.</p>
<p>▲ Unwilling to Show Weakness in the Struggle</p>
<p>Changing sides to start the second half, both sides reorganized their forces. The enemy brought in fresh troops again, with the goal of scoring 100 points to crush our army. Fortunately, our army slightly changed its strategy, using softness to overcome hardness, hoping to salvage the critical situation. Therefore, the performance was better than in the first half. Cai Rongrui took advantage of an enemy foul, missing the first attempt, but then fought forward and hit the basket, starting a new record for the second half. The enemy's left forward immediately retaliated, also scoring a goal. Afterwards, the fierce battle was very intense. Our army was constantly struggling and fighting, unwilling to show weakness. When the score reached 61 to 29, the enemy brought in fresh troops again to strengthen their forces. The veteran Huang, with the cooperation of Wei Wenchang, scored a goal from afar, which was our side's last cheer. The enemy also scored a goal as the game was about to end, as a return. In conclusion, the enemy won with a score of 65 to 31. Watching tonight's game, our passing was slightly improved compared to before, but the enemy's agility and accurate shooting were truly beyond our reach. In addition, fighting as a lone army, with fatigue and hardship, was also a major cause of the defeat.</p>

The Difference Between the High and Low Prices This Week Was as Much as 51 Taels and Seven Qian. Many Large Holders Added Margins, and the Short Side Was Eager to Cover Their Positions. However, the Supply Was Unusually Disparate, Resulting in Unpredictable Price Swings. Spot Red Bars Had a Slight Way Out, with Chartered Marks Adding Around Five Taels. The General Situation of These Six Days Is Recorded Below:</p>
<p>▲ Making Great Progress Every Day Since Monday, Major Silver Has Continued to Shrink One Eight Seven Five to One Two Five, and American Silver Has Also Shrunk One Two Five. Almost all British Exchanges Have Also Shrunk by Half a Gear, Accounting for One Two Five British Gold. As for the Internal Market, There Was a Slight Rotation, but in the End, It Was Slightly Tighter. Therefore, the Standard Gold Opened High, Exceeding 720 Taels, Calculated as 722 and a Half Taels. After the First Order Was Revealed, the Seller Was Active and Had Been to 19.8 Qian. Later, There Were Rumors That Banks Were Absorbing Cash Again, and Chengfeng, Yongchang, Shengyu, Yufa, Yongyu, and Hexingyong Were All Buying Fiercely, so It Reached a High Peak of 30 Taels at Noon. It Was Especially Outstanding in the Early Afternoon, at 31.8 Qian. Then, Dadecheng, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yongheng, and Others Tended to Sell, the Atmosphere Was Not Good, It Turned Downward Sharply, Plunging Nine Taels, Almost Closing at a High of Two or Three Taels, Calculated as 25.3 Qian, Which Was Already Three Consecutive Days of Increase Compared to the Previous Saturday, Calculated as 8.6 Qian. The Total Fluctuation on This Day Was 22 Taels. The Next Day, Major Silver Shrank Again by One Two Five, American Silver Shrank by Half a Point, and American Selling Intentions Were Unceasing. Therefore, the Shanghai British Gold Initially Hung Up Without Changing, but in the Afternoon It Had Shrunk by Half a Gear, and the Internal Market Was Even Tighter. The Industry Was Piling Up, and the Standard Gold Opening Price Rose to 732 Taels, and the Buyers Were Fluent.

The British Gold Initially Hung Up Shrank by Two Gears, Accounting for Half a Penny. In the Afternoon, It Was Changed to Half a Gear, and Almost All the Banks' Minds Were Firm.

Therefore, the Gold Market Suddenly Took Off, Initially Opening and Rising Ten Taels, Exceeding the Fifty Taels Level, Calculated as 53 and a Half Taels. Fuchangyuan, Chengxin, Heng and Others Bought Fervently. Afterwards, the Storm Was Surging, Suddenly Rising and Falling.

In the Afternoon, It Had Retreated to Within 50 Taels, Calculated as 47 and a Half Taels. After Entering, the Indian Exchange Report Was Small, and It Rose Again by Eight Taels. The Result Was 51 Taels and Eight Qian, but Compared to the Previous Day, It Still Rose by 8 Taels and Three Qian, With a Total of 19 Taels and Five Qian Swaying Throughout the Day. The Next Day, Although Major Silver Shrank by Three Seven Five, American Silver Conversely Grew by One Two Five, Because the United States Had a Saying to Maintain Current Silver, So the HSBC Hanging Price Did Not Change, but the Inside Was Relaxed and Tightened Again. There Were Still Purchases in the Gold Industry, and the Standard Gold Opened at the Beginning of the Early Market and Fell Back Five Taels and Three Qian, Calculated as 746 Taels and Five Qian. Afterwards, It Contained a Shapeless Appearance. Ten Points Zero Had Been to 44 Taels and Eight Qian. Yongheng, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Xinxheng and Other Large Households Advanced Fiercely, Leaping Ten Taels.

The Gold Market Opened Slightly Lower by Two Taels and a Half, at 62 Taels and a Half. Then It Was Chaotic. Almost All British Gold Initially Hung Up Did Not Change. After a While, It Suddenly Changed to Shrinking by Half a Gear, and the Internal Market Was Also Very Beautiful.

The Hanging Brand Did Not Change. As for the Standard Gold, It Initially Opened and Rose Seven Taels, for 766 Taels and a Half. Next, It Was Seven and a Half Taels. The Dalian Bang and Others Bought It. Then, Because the Selling Household Was Active, It Only Fell to 60 Taels and Zero Five Qian.

The Noon Moment Sharply Fell Six Taels, and the Closing Price Was 66 Taels and Three Qian, Compared to the Previous Day, It Had Increased by Six Taels and Eight Qian, No Less Than a Small Decline and a Large Return. In the Afternoon, Because the Market Was Closed on Saturday, and the Half Day Was Calculated With a Ten Taels and Three Qian Difference. If the Daily Gold Settlement Price Is Still Pressed 50 Taels Inside and Out, Afterwards, It Is Calculated to Press 70 Taels Outside, the Result Is Around 60 Taels.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton The Course of Yarn and Cotton Soaring Last Week</h3>
<p>▲ The Traders Disappeared... The Buying Sound Was Boiling</p>
<p>▲ The Man Standard Rose More Than Five Taels The Cotton Yarn Was Soft and Fell at the Beginning of Last Week.</p>
<p>It Fell Because a Manufacturer Settled a Large Number of Positions and Fell. Before Long, the Overseas Flower Yarn Situation Was Stable and the Exchange Rate Shrunk Strangely, Resulting in a Large Rise in the Foreign Cotton Silver Market. Indian Cotton Was Difficult to Import, So Raw Cotton Had a Fierce Rise Wind. People's Hearts Were Moved, and Scattered Positions Were Terrified. Most Buyers' Mentality Was That All Things Were Rising in Price, and the Idea of Doing More for Cotton Yarn Was Getting Stronger. In Addition, a Certain Industrialist Also Absorbed a Special Huge Package, So the Pulling Force Was Very Strong, but the Sales of Current Yarn Felt More Lonely, Because the Closing Period Was Approaching, All Parties Were Preparing to End the Business, So It Was Stagnant, but According to Some People, Japanese Factories Directly Loaded and Sold to Places Such As Southeast Asia, Without Going Through the Market, The Detailed Number Should Be Based On the Customs Report. This Kind of Fierce Rise Wind Was Completely Affected by the Exchange Rate and the Cotton Flower Soaring. It Was Found That the Prices of Standard Yarn in Various Months Rose More Than Five Taels Compared to the Previous Week. The Total Turnover Throughout the Week Was 264,300 Packages. Guest Gangs Bought a Total of Only 2,290 Packages of Current Yarn. The Counterparts Entered 340 Packages. There Were Many Rumors on the Weekend Market That A Certain Two Large Households Held a Majority of Flower Yarn Positions, and There Was a Saying That It Was Unstable Because the Price Had Soared for Days, So There Were More and More Buyers, Like A Swarm Coming, So the Market Disc Became Higher and Higher.</p>
<p>The Local Authorities Regarded the Rapid Rise Wind As To Avoid Danger, and Increased the Special Cash for Both Sides by Six Taels, but It Was Still Difficult to Reduce the Rise. According to Some People, There Were About Thirteen, Four Hundred Thousand Packages of Registered Cotton Yarn. From the Current General Situation, It Is Difficult to See Fatigue, but the Actual Sales Are Not Smooth, and the Rise Is Inevitably Too Fast. The Distant Period Has Seen 170 Taels. What Will the Future Be? It Is Difficult to Predict. The Package Amounts That Each Gang Has Bought Are Recorded Separately Below:</p>
<p>Gang Mouth Package Amount Gang Mouth Package Amount Gang Mouth Package Amount</p>
<p>Hankou 100 Southeast Asia 230 Yunnan 260</p>
<p>Inland 535 Jiangxi 80 Sichuan 50</p>
<p>Tianjin 135 Guangdong 795 Changsha 35</p>
<p>Gaoyang 20 Hong Kong 10 Miscellaneous Gang 50</p>
<p>Counterpart 340</p>
<p>▲ The Han Standard Rose 34 Taels. The Cotton Market Softened at the Beginning of the Week Due to the Slight Fatigue of the Yarn Market. Before Long, the Exchange Rate Was Difficult to Grow, and Foreign Cotton Prices Tended to Rise. The Sources of Each Road Were Not Smooth, the Local Goods Were Thin, Japanese Merchants Bought Very Much, and Most Arguments Were Due to the Inability to Import Foreign Cotton, and the Domestic Cotton Was Not Sufficient. There Was a Fear That There Would Be a Cotton Famine in the Future. Japanese Merchants Broadcasted in Foreign Countries With a Strong Atmosphere. Before Long, the Exchange Rate Loosened, and the Foreign Cotton Calculation Silver Disc Was Very Expensive. Therefore, Speculators and Scattered Households Swarmed. After the Short Trend Gang Lost Power, New Throwing Households Disappeared in the Market, and No One Dared to Act Rashly. Lack of Chips Evolved Into This Fierce Rise Wind. On the Weekend, the Local Authorities Regarded the Situation As Urgent, and Increased the Special Security Money by Two Taels to Reduce the Transactions and Make the Ups and Downs Smooth. However, the Buying Sound Still Shook the Outdoors, and the Trend Was Like A Tide Coming. Each Day Jumped One Two, and the Rise Continued for Three Days. The Rising Trend Was Greatly Unrestrained. This Kind of Strong Rise Wind Is Rare in Recent Years. What Will the Future Be? It Must Depend On the Gold Price and Indian Cotton As A Shift. The Prices of Standard Flowers in Various Months Rose by Three or Four Taels Compared to the Previous Week. The Total Turnover Throughout the Week Was 596,900 Dan. Yao Flower Arrival Was 510 Packages. Dongtai Flower Was 200 Packages. Tong Flower 3,600 Packages. American Flower Rose 25 Pounds Compared to the Previous Week. The Manufacturer Entered Current Cotton 8,512 Dan. The Amount That Each Manufacturer Bought Is Recorded Separately Below:</p>
<p>Manufacturer Entry Highest Price Lowest Price Turnover Deadline</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 39.75 36.00 1.400 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shandong American Seed Flower 45.00 ...... 400 Pieces Again</p>
<p>Fine Fluff Flower 41.00 40.50 400 Pieces Again</p>
<h3>American Cotton Returns to Softness, While British and Egyptian Cotton Continue to Be Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American Cotton Was Firm First Due to Foreign Merchants' Purchases, and Then Tired Due to Long Position Settlements and Reactive Sales, Calculated As Futures Fell Three to Nine Pounds of Sound, Spot Fell Five Pounds of Sound, British Cotton Futures Rose Three or Four Points, Spot Rose Two Points, Egyptian Cotton Spot Rose Five Points, Indian Cotton Market Closed.

<h3>Grain Prices: Rice Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, the amount of goods arriving from various sources was scarce, with only about thirty boats. Sales were still good, and the price of white粳 rice seemed stable, remaining around 13.5 yuan. Currently, the粳 rice market generally presents a stagnant and stable situation. According to local customs, the river transport will cease around the 15th, leaving only about one week of trading. Therefore, although both buyers and sellers desire to conclude early, they are still holding their ground, causing prices to fluctuate once more. The supply and sales of薄稻 rice were both sluggish, temporarily maintaining the original price. The market conditions for 羊杜秈 and 步秈 rice were mediocre, and buyers and sellers turned to wait-and-see attitudes. Buyers selectively purchased high-quality goods, while being very picky about medium and lower grades. The market showed no upward or downward movement. The exchange rate gradually softened, and both wholesale and retail sales were sluggish, with prices remaining the same as the previous day. Throughout the day, prices in all stalls remained consistent and stable.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South: Yesterday, the amount of goods arriving from the river remained low, and sales in this area were sluggish. Changshu and Wuxi 北粳 rice was stagnant and sparsely traded, with ordinary and lower grades being discounted, approaching the price level of nearby districts. The buying interest in Suzhou and Tongzhou 白粳 rice was waning, with high and medium-grade goods both decreasing by about half a unit, but superficially, the market was said to be stable. The situation for 南帮 early薄稻 rice turned stable, with scarce arrivals. Retail sales in Ningbo were extremely quiet, with upper-middle and high-grade goods remaining stable, while the rest weakened slightly. Due to the significant drop in Shanghai prices, the origin of the American and various 秈 rice were gradually reducing shipments to Shanghai, and sellers were trying to sell them off. However, goods in storage were still waiting to be sold after the 20th, so the market was quiet and prices were flat. The arrival and sales of 白元 rice were slow, with scarce supply of top-quality goods, and a slight rebound in ordinary middle-grade goods.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter - A Coastal Traveler</h3>
<p>Magician: Ladies and gentlemen, watch closely. I can put my wife in this box, and in a moment, I'll turn her into a pair of white rabbits.</p>
<p>A Spectator: Is that really possible?</p>
<p>Magician: Why not? Watch me perform the trick.</p>
<p>A Spectator: Sir, can you also turn my wife into a pair of white rabbits?</p>
<p>Magician: That wouldn't be a worthwhile deal. Don't you want your wife anymore?</p>
<p>A Spectator (stammering): To tell you the truth, my wife is really too fierce. And my five-year-old son has been begging me every day to buy him a pair of rabbits to play with.</p>
<p>▲ Father (teaching his son): My child, your temperament is too impulsive. It easily leads to mistakes.</p>
<p>Son: Father, then how can I avoid making mistakes?</p>
<p>Father: Everything must be handled with a calm attitude.</p>
<p>Son: Father, I understand. Tomorrow, if our house catches fire, I will definitely handle it with a calm attitude.</p>
<p>▲ Homeowner (about to sell his house, leading the buyer to tour the rooms): Look how meticulously this house is built. All the lumber is top-grade.</p>
<p>Buyer: But some places are not meticulous enough.</p>
<p>Homeowner: Where is there a lack of meticulousness?</p>
<p>Buyer: Look at the ceiling of the reception room. The water stains are all over. It must leak when it rains.</p>
<p>Homeowner: That doesn't matter. Fortunately, we don't have guests every day. And there aren't many rainy days in a year. The leak stops as soon as the rain stops.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Travelogue - Lü Bing</h3>
<p>My friend Mr. Mao has been engaged in trade in the northwestern provinces. Recently, with the situation stabilizing slightly, he returned to the South from afar. During a visit, he recounted the current situation in Xinjiang, including some things that have not been mentioned before. I recorded them, hoping that readers would find them interesting.</p>
<p>Xinjiang province is said to have over 100,000 soldiers. In reality, most of them are locals. Each soldier has a family and land. In peacetime, in addition to training, they mostly engage in farming. In times of war, fathers can send their sons, and brothers can send their brothers. Locals call this "supplementing the quota." However, most civilians are capable of practical shooting. Therefore, supplementing a soldier's quota is seen as adding a mouth to feed. There is also no reluctance to step forward in camp life.</p>
<p>Although the military organization has been improved in recent years, it has not completely abandoned the methods of the previous generation's defense camps. Since Governor Yang Zengxin came to power, officers above the rank of battalion commander have used the Han and Hui people to restrain each other, making it difficult to cause disturbances. For example, if the squad leader is a local, the company commander may be a Hui person. If the company commander is a Han person, the company deputy may be an Afghan. Because these people are not from the same ethnic group, it is difficult for them to conspire together, thereby reducing the possibility of rebellion. However, the influence of external forces is constantly expanding. If the border is alerted, the military strength of Xinjiang alone will not be sufficient to resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>In Xinjiang, currencies are either Russian banknotes or 羗帖, which are not uniform. However, for Han people trading in the area, the procedure for remitting money is extremely complicated and difficult. If they carry silver out of the province, they are subject to difficulties everywhere if the amount exceeds fifty yuan. Han people leaving the province must first state the reason and apply for a passport. After several months, the passport is obtained. Every time they reach a place, they must undergo strict inspections. Any discrepancy will result in detention, and the money they carry is likely to be confiscated. Therefore, people from Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, and Henan often settle in Xinjiang for life and never return. This is probably due to the inconvenience they feel along the way.</p>
<h3>On Destiny, Physiognomy, and Zodiac Signs - Fei Wenbao</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Jingxiong, besides being proficient in law, also enjoys studying physiognomy. Once, at a banquet, he met Mr. Liu Dajun, director of the statistics office of the Legislative Yuan, and said that his appearance resembled a rabbit and that he must be forty years old. Upon inquiry, it was indeed so. Before going abroad last year, he happened to deduce my fortune and instructed me to be wary of financial loss this winter. As a result, I suffered an unexpected loss of a thousand taels of silver. According to Mr. Wu, he is thirty-three years old, with the zodiac sign of a pig. However, he is slender and fair-skinned, with no signs of being fat or dull. He also once discussed physiognomy for his old classmate Mr. Zhou, saying that he had a problem with solitude. In reality, Mr. Zhou is known to the world as a highly moral gentleman. It seems that the theories of destiny, physiognomy, and zodiac signs are sometimes accurate and sometimes not.

<p>Letters sent from Beiping take more than a month to arrive at the earliest. Generally, transportation through Russia is faster, while routes through Gansu and arid areas are slower. The Xinjiang authorities are more lenient with letters sent from neighboring provinces. However, letters from the south are usually delivered four or five days after arrival, as they must be opened and carefully inspected. As for newspapers and magazines, most of them are detained. Therefore, the people there are very isolated from the situation in the country.</p>
<h3>A Record of Masaki and Watanabe's Visit to Suzhou - Yun Ji from Wumen</h3>
<p>The Principal of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, Masaki Naohiko, and the painter Watanabe Seimu were ordered to come to China to discuss the exhibition of Yuan, Ming, Qing, and modern paintings. They traveled to famous scenic spots in Shanghai and Hangzhou, and were entertained by celebrities in both places almost every day. On the 28th, the two gentlemen visited Suzhou, accompanied by Masaki Tokusan, Iijima Masao, Wu Dongmai, and others. They arrived at the port at noon and stayed at the Railway Hotel. They immediately visited the Japanese Consul, 川南省. In the afternoon, the weather cleared after a quick snow, with a calm breeze and warm sunshine. The Japanese led them to visit the sights of Tiger Hill. The Suzhou area is vast, with plains as far as the eye can see. The ancient temples and towering pagodas, the boulders and sword ponds, are all spectacular. They lingered until dusk before returning. The next afternoon, Gu Gongxiong, Wu Hufan, and Wu Dongmai hosted a banquet for them at Yiyuan. Painters and collectors were present. More than a dozen famous paintings from Gu's collection were displayed. In the afternoon, they visited the Lingering Garden. The bamboos and trees in the garden are lush, and the courtyards and pavilions are deep and secluded. The flowers, rocks, and furnishings are all elegant and extraordinary, making it the best garden in the southeast. Its exquisite grandeur is probably unmatched in Japan. They also took a short rest at Xiyuan. The five hundred golden Arhats in the temple are solemn and magnificent, making it a grand spectacle of Buddhist statues. They also visited the Lion Grove. The rocks in the grove were designed by Ni Yunlin of the Yuan Dynasty, and are exquisite and fantastical, showing the artist's lofty ideals. On that day, the Shanghai China Academy of Art's painting exhibition was held at the Suzhou People's Education Center. Mr. Masaki and others were delighted to hear this and ordered their carriages to go there. They were received by professors Ma Mengrong, Zheng Manqing, Zhang Hongwei, and Ma Weizhong, who showed them all the works. They praised them highly and emphasized that beginners should start with pure painting methods. If they pursue distant and lofty goals, they may go astray. This artistic principle is the same in ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign. His words are indeed reasonable. That evening, the professors of the school hosted a banquet for them at the Ziyou Nongchang. Zhang Zhongren, Pan Jingsi, and other seniors, as well as painters and calligraphers Fan Shaoyun, Chen Jiaxian, Yu Tongfu, Gu Zhonghua, Xu Kangmin, and Guan Yide were present. They talked and laughed happily, and everyone drank freely. On the 30th, they attended a luncheon at the Japanese Consulate. In the afternoon, they took a train to Beijing. Suzhou is a famous city in the southeast, with a flourishing culture. Historically, it has been a region known for its artistic development. In recent years, the city has been renovated and transportation has been improved, making it convenient for travelers. Although Mr. Masaki and others stayed for three days, they had not yet visited the scenic spots of Tianping and Dengwei, which they regretted very much. He greatly admired the painters and calligraphers Chen Huixian, Fan Shaoyun, Wu Hufan, and Liu Linchuan here. He especially sympathized with Ma Mengrong, who came to Suzhou. Every time he saw his</p>
<h3>Parisian Tales (27) - Liu Ceng, sent from Paris</h3>
<p>The ruins of Termes are now incorporated into the Musée de Cluny, serving as a small garden for the museum. To visit the ruins of Termes, one must enter through the Musée de Cluny. Now that we have mentioned the ruins of Termes, let us also talk about the Musée de Cluny.</p>
<p>The main entrance of the Musée de Cluny is located on Rue du Sommerard, opposite the University of Paris. The building itself is as old as the artifacts displayed inside. This is a well-preserved and refined building from the early 14th century that is quite famous in French architectural history. The museum's collection focuses on European artifacts from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. There are many exquisite carvings made of marble, boxwood, and ivory, which are priceless. In addition, there are many gems, silverware, and small pieces of French enamel, which are also rarely seen elsewhere. Other items include various metal and wooden utensils, pottery and glass, carpets, lace, various textiles, weapons, and relics used by ancient monarchs. There are a wide variety of items, totaling over 20,000, stored in over 30 rooms on the upper and lower floors. The richness of the collection is breathtaking. Two items in the Musée de Cluny are particularly noteworthy: the chastity belts used by European men during the Crusades when they feared their wives would be unfaithful while they were away fighting in the East. One type was used by the wealthy and was made of steel with intricate carvings, completely locking up the front and back of the lower body, leaving only small holes for urination and defecation. The other type was used by ordinary people and was more crude, only locking up the front of the woman's lower body. These chastity belts can be said to be an extremely inhumane form of degrading women's dignity. The barbarity of Europeans six or seven hundred years ago can be imagined simply from the creation of these cruel chastity belts. Visitors to Paris should not miss the opportunity to visit the Musée de Cluny to see them.</p>
<p>works, he praised them endlessly. It is said that Watanabe brought Ma Mengrong's paintings to Japan, where they were greatly admired by Japanese artists. Japan has recently been focusing on flower and bird paintings, and Ma Mengrong is also skilled in flower and bird painting.</p>
<h3>Record of a Six-Year-Old Child's Admonition to His Father - Song Lu</h3>
<p>Canxia Sheng had become very close to Qinglian, and he took her to visit famous scenic spots in Suzhou, Wuxi, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang. It had been half a year. He had once briefly returned to his hometown in Songjiang, but had not entered his house even though he passed by twice. His wife, Ms. Shen, was from the bank of Mandarin Duck Lake, and was excellent in both poetry and prose. She was gentle, understanding, and polite, and came from a distinguished family. She was a good woman raised under traditional ethics. She did not feel jealous or angry when she learned that her husband had someone else he favored. She focused on raising her six-year-old son, relying on her needlework to make a living. Her son, named Niu'er, was quite intelligent. He studied at a private school and did not drop out even though his father did not provide for him. She joked with him, saying, "My son, your father is not coming back, and your mother is also going to abandon you. What will you do?" Niu'er cried and said, "I know that Mother is just teasing me. But having a father like this is worse than having no father. Although, Mother, don't worry that Father will never come back. If he does, I will definitely not let him leave again." The mother smiled. So the mother and son lived in peace, forgetting that their husband had abandoned them. One day, Sheng suddenly returned. His clothes were tattered. He argued with his wife upon seeing her. Then, he rummaged through boxes and chests, inspecting everything. He saw that the title deeds to the fields were completely intact. He secretly suspected that his wife was too comfortable, unaware of how she had been living for the past few months.</p>
<p>He was in a hurry to leave. So the wife grabbed his arm and said, "Husband, why are you so heartless? It is not a pity for you to abandon me. Don't you think about your lovely young son?" The husband did not have the patience to listen. He shook off her arm and walked away quickly. When Niu'er saw this, he suddenly blocked the door with both hands, crying. Then he knelt on the ground and said, "Father is abandoning me. Why was I born? If Father really wants to leave, then watch me jump into the well to die." After saying that, he immediately climbed the well railing in front of the door, wanting to jump down. Sheng was very frightened and quickly hugged him, speaking to him gently. Niu'er said sadly, "If Father still loves his son, please don't leave again. Otherwise, it is better for the son to have no father, and it is better for the father to have no son. The son will definitely admonish you with death." Sheng was greatly moved upon hearing these words and agreed to stay. He has been at home for a month now, and his attitude has changed drastically. He is more affectionate with his wife than during their honeymoon. Sometimes, when he receives letters from his lover, Ms. Qinglian, he tears them up one by one to show his resolve. This matter was told to me by my literary friend, Wo Yun Sheng. Wo Yun has a marriage relationship with Canxia, so what he said should not be false.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (367) - Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 17: Having the Skill to Preserve Youth, Her Fine Eyebrows Become Mixed With Dark Green; Lacking a Way to Prolong Life, He Buys Excellent Steeds in the Golden Market.</p>
<p>That night, Hua Lao Liu prepared to organize her suitcases and asked a young maid, A Bao, to help. She moved out several suitcases, opened the lids, and Lao Liu just nodded, feeling that those clothes seemed outdated. Little A Bao was moved by curiosity. Seeing those colorful clothes, she had already exclaimed in admiration. Hua Lao Liu asked her to take them out one by one. Little A Bao said, "Miss Liu, this one looks very fashionable. You should take it with you." Hua Yuanchun shook her head and said, "Look, the sleeves are like brushstrokes, how can they be good to wear?" Little A Bao took out another one and asked, "What about this one?" Hua Yuanchun shook her head again and said, "This one seems to be from the Qianlong era! No, no, I won't take it." At that time, the copper bed, the sofa, and the chairs were all covered with clothes. But from Hua Lao Liu's perspective, not a single piece was worth taking. She was satisfied with making a few clothes in Shanghai for this trip to Beijing. Unfortunately, she had not raised the money to make clothes. Fortunately, she originally had a lot of clothes, so she could manage. Just then, a little sister came to visit her. She walked into her room and saw a world of clothes everywhere. She smiled and said, "Lao Liu, what are you doing? Are you preparing to open a clothing store?" Hua Yuanchun sighed and said, "I'm leaving in two days. Once I go this time, I don't know when I'll be back. I want to take a few more clothes with me. Who knew that when I opened the suitcase to look, there wasn't a single piece of clothing I could take. It's really infuriating." That little sister said, "There are now many tailors in the south of Beijing. They make very good clothes, but the labor costs are a bit more expensive. Besides, you're not going for very long. At most, you'll be back in one or two seasons." Hua Lao Liu said angrily, "It's all because of a few cursed pennies that I'm forced to leave Shanghai. If it's good, then it's good. If it's not good, I'll die in Beijing and never come back." That little sister said, "Don't say that. Harsh words are venomous." Hua Yuanchun said, "Really, if I can't make it in Beijing, I won't come back to the South." This little sister tried to persuade her and also made an appointment to eat a big meal at Yipinxiang tomorrow to send her off. After talking for a while, she left. Hua Yuanchun then ordered Little A Bao to call one of her helpers from downstairs to carry the clothes taken out of the suitcase. She used two large bed sheets to pack them into two large bundles to be sent to the pawnshop early tomorrow morning. She emptied two suitcases and packed her favorite things into them, such as perfumes costing a dozen yuan a bottle, and bottles of all kinds of styles. Fearing they would break, she wrapped them in cotton wool and stuffed old Shen Bao newspapers all around, even more thoroughly than an antique collector protecting his porcelain. Then, she ordered twenty pairs of shoes from a vegetarian shop, in cherry white, honey yellow, parrot green, rose purple, West Lake color, lotus root color, embroidered with goldfish, swallows, mandarin ducks, and butterflies. There was nothing that was not there. Fearing that the style of the shoes would be damaged, they were all placed in boxes in the suitcase.</p>

<h3>Foch's Diary of the European War, Translated by Gu Angruo</h3>
<p>In 1870, our army, enamored with defensive warfare and lacking resistance, failed. In 1914, our army, influenced by a single-minded focus on offensive warfare and lacking adaptability, encountered many useless setbacks and brutal casualties. The key lies in thoroughly studying the advantages and disadvantages of both offense and defense each time, and then deciding on the possibilities of attack and defense. A powerful offensive often arises from the clever use of both methods. As the number of combatant troops increases, the combination of these offensive and defensive strategies becomes even more necessary.</p>
<p>In the years when our officers diligently studied offensive warfare, they were truly excited to the extreme, confident that offensive warfare was the most important. However, they forgot the extraordinary power of modern artillery warfare. They paid too little attention to military equipment, which led to the fact that our infantry units had fewer machine guns than the German army.</p>
<p>Our army corps had only one hundred and twenty 75mm cannons. The German corps, although weaker in infantry, had one hundred and sixty cannons, many of which were 150mm and 105mm howitzers. The artillery in our army was equally inferior to the German army in terms of numbers and caliber. Although our elite infantry had various advantages, especially when attacking, they could not make up for the deficiencies in the number and caliber of artillery. Moreover, they were not suitable for high-angle artillery fire. When defending, the protective artillery fire fragmented the enemy's tenacious attacks, which could give us great advantages. However, to take advantage of these strategies, our artillery should have a huge supply of ammunition. Unfortunately, each gun only had 1,500 rounds, and the production of shells was not prepared to a sufficient scale.</p>
<p>In terms of air force and battlefield telephone and telegraph, we were significantly insufficient. Mr. Han Baote's speech in the summer of 1914 attracted national attention to these dangers, but it was too late. Improvements were not possible, and instead, valuable intelligence was sent to the enemy.</p>
<p>In reality, our government was completely determined to adopt a peaceful policy and did not feel that there was a need to protect the country, so for many years it refused to raise war funds. Therefore, in the modern warfare where military equipment is becoming increasingly important, we lacked the material tools necessary to successfully maintain combat. This is another reason why our unwavering approach to offensive warfare was bound to encounter serious difficulties in practice. The relationship between politics and military command is so close that the latter can be said to be a continuation of the former. No matter how enthusiastic he is, no matter how eager he is to achieve victory through the sole path of a brave offensive, the leader of a country's army in wartime is often constrained by the political situation and has no choice but to adopt a defensive posture at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>We have a first-class General Staff that can compensate for our theoretical weaknesses. The officers of the General Staff have a thorough understanding of their work, and there are several with extraordinary intelligence. The Army University and the Advanced Military Academy have developed the work desire of our officers, while training and expanding their talents. Those with talent can apply what they have learned and improved in these schools. During the war, they quickly adapted to whatever new environment and established great achievements.</p>
<p>However, most of them are young and psychologically immature, so they have to be led and guided. That is to say, they lack the experience to develop judgment and the habit of authority to give officers calm confidence. Calm confidence can produce intelligent and powerful decisions.</p>
<p>In all circumstances, from the very beginning, the actions of conscription and mobilization, the transportation of troops and military supplies, and the heavy work behind the war zone must all be carried out with perfect accuracy.</p>
<p>When the war broke out, I commanded the 20th Army Corps stationed in Langhan. The residents there, like those in the Luren area, expressed particularly high patriotic fervor. At that time, the French were all inspired by patriotism. For more than forty years, their arms had stretched across the border to seize the Metz area, and to the brothers in the lost Luren area. Now they ask themselves if one day their fates can be reunited.</p>
<p>During the first few weeks of the Battle of the Marne (at the beginning of the war), Foch was leading the 20th Army Corps in the initial battle of Mahern in Luren. On August 28, 1914, he was summoned to Xiafei's headquarters. When he arrived, the commander-in-chief was planning how and when to counterattack the pursuing German army and prevent them from advancing victoriously directly towards Paris. Foch was greatly shocked to hear about the retreat of the Allied forces, but he felt relieved when he saw that Xiafei's demeanor was not chaotic or panicked. Xiafei immediately commissioned him to lead a detachment, which later became the French 9th Army.</p>
<p>(His chief of staff was Colonel Weigen, who is now the head of the French military organization and remained with Foch throughout the war. There was also an adjutant who later became the French Prime Minister, Mr. Taidiyan. The newly formed 9th Army was completed when Xiafei issued the famous offensive order of September 5. On September 6, 1914, the famous First Battle of the Marne took place. In this entire great war, the 9th Army fought very bravely.</p>
<p>(Foch's diary of this period describes the scope of this historical battle in a relatively narrow way. He records his own achievements, not the history of the entire war. He records the battles of the 9th Army in detail, but by the end of his diary, it is clear that he is studying the overall problems of the war from the limited superior position of an army.</p>
<p>(The task of the 9th Army was to hold the line of defense between the French 4th and 5th Armies, and to stand by to pursue the enemy. On September 9, it had been fighting fiercely for three days with the German 3rd Army commanded by General Huo Wusheng. The 9th Army felt that the situation was gradually becoming favorable to the Allied forces, and the enemy began to retreat in panic. At that time, Foch issued several encouraging orders to his troops.)</p>
<p>After a few days, I became more familiar with my troops. I was not with them when they fought in Billys, but I now begin to understand the impression that this harsh experience gave them.</p>
<p>The Moroccan Division (General Han Baote) of the 9th Army Corps had been fighting fiercely for several days and suffered heavy losses. The morale of the division was still good, but reinforcements were urgently needed. The 17th Division (General Gainabote) of the army corps had not yet experienced intense combat.</p>
<p>The severe suffering of the 11th Army Corps, especially in the Maison area, left its mark on the soldiers. Many officers died. In particular, the soldiers of the Breton regiments often requested that officers be sent again to lead them against the enemy.</p>
<p>The 42nd Division was the best in order. The division had only recently arrived and was well-commanded, and had not yet experienced major sacrifices. Several reserve divisions arrived and immediately joined the front line, engaging in battle for several days, which gave them a great blow. Many of their officers had no experience and were too old, so the soldiers of those divisions still needed encouragement, and their officers still needed new blood.</p>
<p>Our orderly retreat these few days has not only enabled us to avoid the enemy's pursuit, but also to reorganize discipline and restore order. The arrival of reinforcements has also enabled us to reorganize and reorganize the ranks of the reserve divisions, which has also allowed them to leave the excitement of the front line. Our lines are now gradually consolidating and standing firm, and we have established contact with the 5th and 4th Armies on the left and right flanks. The result is a great improvement in the strategic situation, which has generated confidence.</p>
<p>The harshness of sleepless nights during the fighting and the fatigue of marching exacerbated the inevitable frustration of the retreat, and the entire army was in a state of severe fatigue. However, it can already be predicted that after a few days of rest and reorganization, the army will be ready to return to the front line to attack the enemy and can be expected to have a chance of victory. However, the hope of a general offensive again on or around September 2 seems to be temporarily possible and now appears to be abandoned.</p>
<p>This is the situation at the beginning of September. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Words Cannot Describe the Heartbreak</h3>
<p>A Tragic Scene in the Fudan Examination Hall</p>
<p>The first stage that young men and women must go through is the "reading" stage. Only then can they run on to the courtship stage, the career selection stage, and so on. Nowadays, one cannot study on one's own. One must step into the gate of a so-called school and rely on teachers' guidance and classmates' corrections to achieve good results. But that is not the case. Most young people today go to school not to study, but to pursue a noble title. Because in the eyes of most people today, qualifications are very important. The so-called qualification is a mark that represents the depth of a person's knowledge. For example, if his qualification is high school graduation, then his knowledge is only of an ordinary level. If his qualification is university graduation, then his knowledge is naturally of a specialized level. When taking up a job in today's society, the level of the qualification is also used to determine the appropriate position. Therefore, the "entrance examination" has become the key to the success or failure of young men and women themselves.</p>
<p>This time, Fudan University's recruitment of new students attracted a very enthusiastic response. However, there were very few female students, which aroused the attention of the general student body. The well-known Ms. Fen was the most prominent one. Ms. Fen had already studied at Fudan for a semester, but she was a special student in the Department of Journalism. According to Fudan's newly revised regulations, all special students with a total average score of 85 or above must pass the new student entrance examination to become regular students and may not be exempt from the examination or part of the examination. Therefore, Ms. Fen also had to abide by these newly revised regulations and take the examination. The reason for her applying to the Department of Journalism is, of course, very simple. Because of her excellent social skills, and her performance as the lead actress in new plays, she has received some false praise. In fact, a female journalist like this is very much needed in China. It is not necessary to mention her true talents. There are particularly many news about Ms. Fen in the most popular tabloids in today's society. Many of them are actually detrimental to her reputation and morality. According to what she herself said to others, none of the news about her in the tabloids is correct. They are nothing more than those useless young men who are messing with her, maliciously spreading rumors to seduce the public. Because when she was studying at school, she often received so-called love letters from male classmates. For various reasons, she could not grant their requests. Moreover, regarding these letters, she not only did not politely express her refusal to them, but simply did not reply to them at all. Therefore, she suffered their resentment and was arbitrarily attacked and destroyed in various tabloids. This may be close to the truth. However, because of these twists and turns, Ms. Fen once published an article in today's society about her giving of love. The gist of it was that she would not marry the non-dramatic scholar Mr. Munui.</p>
<p>Ms. Fen also took great pains to apply to Fudan. This time, Mr. Munui participated in a certain drama club's performance in the capital. Ms. Fen did not follow, because taking the school examination was more important. This was a personal key and could not be ignored. This concept was very correct in Ms. Fen's mind, unlike the general so-called modern women, who only want to find a suitable spouse, and who would be happy to study? How pleasant it is to exchange love letters with a lover, ride in a car, eat big meals, watch movies, and dance. Really, enjoy the blessings of a lover, and study so hard for what? What is the use of studying? The concept of studying that appears in her mind has considerable significance, which is worthy of our respect.</p>
<p>It is as difficult for young people to apply to schools as it was for Wu Zixu to enter Zhaoguan. Especially when applying to national or registered vocational schools, one must first obtain a qualification of graduating from a secondary school. Still afraid that one's knowledge is not enough to take the examination, one has to go through considerable preparation, such as reviewing the lessons one has already studied, focusing on the subjects to be tested, and some even wholeheartedly studying day and night those "application guides" and "encyclopedic Q&amp;A" compiled and printed by speculative publishers, as well as the past entrance examination questions of various universities in China published in the Commercial Press's Student Magazine. However, even with such preparation, one is still afraid of not being admitted, so one begs the teachers who are acquainted with one's parents and brothers and the classmates one has known to vigorously promote one. From this point of view, entering school is as difficult as passing Zhaoguan.</p>
<p>Even applying to a school requires going through a lot of complicated procedures, such as asking for a prospectus and registering. On the day of the examination, one has to take the examination with trepidation, as if facing a great disaster. Sometimes, one also has to meditate and silently pray, hoping to be admitted. In terms of spirit, it can be said that one suffers a great loss. Some even hallucinate in their dreams that they have "failed the examination" and are awakened by the shock. I think everyone who has been through it can understand this kind of phenomenon. The day after the examination, one goes to buy a newspaper very early to read the advertisement of the school one applied to for the admission of new students, and reads it carefully from beginning to end. If one is lucky enough to be admitted, what a happy thing that is! Not only is one's own heart blooming, but one's parents and brothers are also very proud, just like getting a xiucai or hanlin degree in the imperial examination era in our country. Really, some people now say that being admitted to a middle school or university is like getting the title of a foreign xiucai or a foreign hanlin. Although this contains a feudal metaphor, this good method of selecting talents is still used today, but the name of the imperial examination has been changed to examination. Therefore, the recent establishment of the Examination Yuan of the National Government is also for this reason. Applying to a school is a kind of talent selection in a small society, and its significance is very similar. Therefore, school examinations are generally valued, and young men and women must also pass this stage. In other words, applying to a school is the ladder for young people to advance. If one applies to the highest institution of learning and fails to be admitted, it is a very unpleasant thing. Some even go to the path of negativity and practice the most meaningless suicide. Some cry a lot, marking the end of the tragic application process. The latter is more common among female students.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Fudan has been adopting strict principles in recruiting new students, especially in the Department of Journalism of the School of Liberal Arts, in order to cultivate editorial and management talents for domestic newspapers. Therefore, the number of new students admitted each time is smaller than in other departments. This time, a total of five students, including transfer students, were admitted. Many people will inevitably be disappointed and have regrets of "failing the examination." The well-known Ms. Fen applied to this Department of Journalism, which is difficult to be admitted to. The result was that she hit a wall. Outsiders do not know much about her scores in each subject this time, but the logic test question was that one could complete the paper by answering two out of three questions.</p>
<p>According to what the classmates saw of her answers, it was like this:</p>
<p>1. Types of Evidence</p>
<p>(Answer) Do not tell lies, do not talk nonsense. (The word "dao" here may be that Ms. Zuo could not remember how to write it for a moment, so she left it blank.)</p>
<p>2. Intension and Extension</p>
<p>(Answer) Logic must have intension, but it must also extend a few examples. In short, this is all logic.</p>
<p>The author has not dared to change a single word in the above answers. Although I have also studied some logic in the past, but it has been too long, and the impression left is very vague. Therefore, I dare not make a judgment on whether Ms. Fen's answers are correct or not. Regarding these, it is still a small problem. The biggest problem is that Ms. Fen's diploma was found to be fake.</p>
<p>According to Ms. Fen, this is another trick played by those male classmates who were rejected by her. Needless to say, Ms. Fen's application to the Department of Journalism this time has indeed aroused the attention of many classmates. Perhaps some classmates are dissatisfied with her or harbor resentment, so they wrote an anonymous letter to the registration office, saying that this diploma of hers belonged to her sister, and cited evidence, one of the types of evidence in logic. Therefore, the registration office examined her diploma, and the result was that it was found to be fake. Of course, even if her score in the examination this time was very good, there was no hope of being admitted.</p>
<p>Now, the registered vocational schools in Shanghai are very strict in examining the qualifications of students, so Fudan is of course no exception. The well-known Ms. Fen was also rejected because of this diploma.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day when the examination was completed, Ms. Fen asked the registration office about everything with trepidation. Of course, she could only be disappointed. She also cried bitterly from disappointment. It was really more sad than anything else. It was more sad than losing love.</p>
<p>The students of Fudan have always been curious. Some things are actually very trivial, but they all make a fuss about them. This time, Ms. Fen's crying, needless to say, caused a sensation throughout the school. Everyone took it as a joke. The curious students who surrounded her in front of the registration office not only did not express deep sympathy to her, but also applauded and laughed. This laughter also contained sarcasm. Therefore, Ms. Fen cried even more sadly, almost unable to make a sound. It was truly a tragicomedy in the examination hall, and she played the important protagonist in this play.</p>
<p>Under this situation, there was really no way to save it. Ms. Fen's grief and anger could not be vented to the fullest. She could only swallow her anger and walk out of Zibin College (the examination hall of the School of Liberal Arts of Fudan). The students were always oblivious to the situation and followed behind her. She could only silently lower her head and walk forward listlessly. When she stepped onto the rickshaw, passed through Xiangyin Road, and ran towards Shanghai with lingering reluctance towards Fudan, this tragic scene that caused a sensation throughout the school came to an end.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we have to take the analytical geometry exam. The four of us, who usually don't work hard in mathematics, had to cram and memorize the formulas this evening.</p>
<p>The lights in the dormitory are turned off at 10 o'clock. Only the toilet and the stairs have lights on all night. However, the smell in the toilet is too unpleasant, and there is no comfortable place to sit on the stairs. In the end, we decided to go to the classroom to cram. We first told the maid who was in charge of locking the dormitory door. At first, she said, "No, Mr. Shen [the dormitory supervisor] will scold me if he finds out." After we told her that Mr. Shen had gone to bed early because he had a headache, she agreed to let us in and lock the door for her.</p>
<p>You have to eat something to drive away sleepiness when you cramming. We are very experienced. We glanced at the dormitory supervisor's room and saw that there was no one there. We secretly slipped out of the school gate to buy a lot of fruits and candies and brought them to the classroom.</p>
<p>We put the tables together and spread the food in the middle. We ate the food while holding our pens and seriously substituting the formulas for calculation.</p>
<p>The food on the table gradually turned into peels at our feet, and our eyelids gradually became heavy. The black characters on the book gradually floated in front of our eyes. We were all yawning one after another.</p>
<p>"What should we do? We haven't even worked out a third of it yet. I'm already too tired," Yun said, stretching.</p>
<p>"Why am I not tired? I really hate this mathematics. Look, how many hours it has sacrificed for me to do other things on weekdays. And tonight, the time for me to sleep comfortably is ruined in its hands. If it were an elective subject, I would really not be happy to cram for it. I would rather not have this credit," Chu said, slamming the math book on the table. She deeply hated mathematics. As long as there was a chance, she would immediately complain about mathematics.</p>
<p>"If it were an elective subject, I would have already not chosen it," I said.</p>
<p>"Hey, listen, what's that?" Yi, who has always been timid, said softly in a panic.</p>
<p>In the silent air of the night, only our breaths could be heard. Occasionally, one or two car horns could be heard from afar.</p>
<p>"It's the sound of a car, right?"</p>
<p>"No, I clearly heard the sound of "tch"."</p>
<p>"It seems to be just outside the room."</p>
<p>"I didn't hear it."</p>
<p>"I seem to have heard it too."</p>
<p>Sleepiness had already been overcome by this unexpected event. Everyone stared at the dark corridor outside the room.</p>
<p>"Let's go to sleep. Let's get up at five o'clock tomorrow morning to cram early," Yun said. But that was what we all wanted to say.</p>
<p>The four of us squeezed together very tightly and deliberately made big footsteps to embolden ourselves. We walked through the dark corridor and went into the dormitory, covered our heads with the quilt, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>The next day, Chu was still the first to wake up. She woke us all up. When we looked, it was already past seven o'clock.</p>
<p>"Ha, cram early? I didn't even hear the alarm clock."</p>
<p>"What about the math exam today?"</p>
<p>"I can only hope that the questions he asks are what we prepared last night."</p>
<p>"I think so too, but it won't be, right?"</p>
<p>Everyone ate the porridge very uneasily. When we went to the classroom and passed the notice board of the Education Affairs Office, a piece of paper suddenly caught our eye very vividly. "Mathematics teacher Mr. Zhao ×× is on sick leave." We all jumped up happily.</p>
<h3>Poet Buddha</h3>
<p>"The winds and rains of the Huangpu River are many, quietly filling one with sorrow..." Our poet and literary figure Xu Guang is indoors, unfurling a fine sheet of paper, writing down the excellent lines he just managed to compose after much laborious thought. He hasn't thought of the following lines yet, so he's still murmuring to himself.</p>
<p>"Old Xu, what ghostly things are you writing again? Let's see it, everyone. Isn't it a love letter?" Lin Zhen, Wang De, and Mao Jicheng swarmed in, all clamoring for Xu Guang to show them what was on the paper.</p>
<p>"Don't be so noisy! I'm writing a poem. With all this commotion, my poetic thoughts will all run away!" Xu Guang said to them while showing them the paper.</p>
<p>"This week, there's been too much rain and too much wind. We haven't seen the sun at all. No wonder our poet is feeling melancholy," said Lin Zhen.</p>
<p>"Brother Xu, these two lines of poetry are truly excellent. I wonder where you picked them up. The following sentences must be as skillful as the first two, which is quite difficult," Wang De complimented Xu Guang.</p>
<p>"Indeed, it has some merit. Let me continue it," Xu Guang said as he picked up his pen and added the lines "Laborious sorrow worsens illness, a poet's grief is doubled." Then he threw down his pen and collapsed, saying, "My strength is exhausted."</p>
<p>"Good poem, good poem! This only adds to the status of our poet. I'm afraid people will be amazed! Old Xu, quickly take it to the 'Xin Yue Weekly' so the whole world can appreciate it!" Mao Jicheng urged Xu Guang.</p>
<p>"Damn it, last week I wrote an article about female students and love in the Daily News," causing Ms. Yu to give me a good scolding. I'm never opening my mouth again," Xu Guang said in an aggrieved tone.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, but he couldn't hide his complacent expression.</p>
<p>"Alright, even Ms. Yu is favoring the poet now. Congratulations, congratulations!"</p>
<p>"What's so great about Ms. Yu? She's too weak. Ms. Lu is much better looking. Yu Zhu doesn't even compare to Lu Meixin. I heard she even has a lung disease." Lin Zhen, who usually supported Ms. Lu, quickly brought up Ms. Lu as a shield when he heard them mention Ms. Yu.</p>
<p>Ms. Yu and Ms. Lu are freshmen who recently entered the school. Relying on their good looks and lively social skills, they have caused quite a sensation in the school. Almost all the students look at the two Ms. Yu and Ms. Lu, and listen to the two Ms. Yu and Ms. Lu. The two Ms. Yu and Ms. Lu have become the center of students' conversations after class. Those who stand on Ms. Yu's side are called the Left, and those who stand on Ms. Lu's side are called the Right. The two factions have even engaged in fierce written battles in the school's publications. The school is in a state of chaos. Therefore, the conversations of Xu Guang, Wang De, and their peers inevitably involve the two ladies again.</p>
<p>"Down with the rightists!" three of the four men shouted, clearly all being from the Left.</p>
<p>"What do you say is good about Ms. Yu?" Lin Zhen said indignantly.</p>
<p>"Ms. Yu has slender, curved eyebrows and lively, sparkling eyes. Just one look from her, and you won't even dare to breathe."</p>
<p>"Yu Zhu's face has the color of an apple. When she smiles, you can see her snow-white teeth and the deep dimples on her cheeks. Just one smile from her, and your soul will be lost for half a day."</p>
<p>"The most beautiful are her legs. The curves... so beautiful... so sensual..." Xu Guang shook his head and launched into his grand theory, even humming a little poem:</p>
<p>"Yu Zhu's beauty,</p>
<p>Even the angels in the heavens are not as good.</p>
<p>I want to kneel at her skirt and worship her.</p>
<p>I thank God for the miracle, creating her!"</p>
<p>"Enough, believers in Yu Zhu, I won't argue with you," Lin Zhen said, feeling isolated, and slipped away in a huff.</p>
<p>"Ah Lin, running away, feeling embarrassed!" Wang and Mao shouted as they chased after him.</p>
<p>Now, only the poet Xu Guang is left in the room. He suddenly felt a sense of ispeeli chun, so he picked up his pen again to continue writing poetry.</p>
<p>"The four walls are cold and empty, only the poet's groans, one after another, drifting out the window..."</p>
<h3>Foreign Slave by Zhong Zhu</h3>
<p>Because my father had bad luck and lost his job for two or three years, economic problems arose.</p>
<p>One dreary and lonely evening, I was sitting alone with a lamp, preparing for school. In the dim light, my father's withered face was revealed, and I heard his unnatural sigh. In that sigh, a voice suddenly called my name, "Lian'er..."</p>
<p>But before he could finish his sentence, his eyes were filled with hot tears. The state of wanting to speak but not speaking prompted me to say,</p>
<p>"Father, whatever you want to say, just say it. Your son will surely obey."</p>
<p>He forced his voice, speaking haltingly what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>"Lian'er, in the past, you may have seen that I often had a smile on my face. But these past few years, everything about me has changed greatly. Since losing my job two or three years ago, the savings I earned from my hard work have been used up for two or three years and are about to run out. Originally, all my hopes were pinned on you. Now, in this critical moment of survival, I have no choice but to abandon your future, your bright and great hopes, and reluctantly stop your studies. I have to place you, weak and inexperienced, in the commercial world of this dark society. Perhaps your tuition and book fees can slightly lighten the burden of my life. Yesterday, Uncle Wang came over. He has secured a position as a trainee in a foreign firm run by the Japanese. He will probably take your luggage to the store the morning after tomorrow.</p>
<p>It's already been settled. Do you have any opinions?"</p>
<p>All of the above was like a huge iron hammer, hitting my head hard. I was stunned, and my senses were completely lost. I had a vague understanding of everything, not knowing who told me to say, "Father, I agree. Let's go..."</p>
<p>Now, I have willingly been doing the so-called "running dog" and "foreign slave" work for about two years. I feel as if I have been fully anesthetized. The slogans of "Down with Imperialism" and all the grand and fierce May Fourth Movement from my school days make me feel stupid and foolish.</p>
<p>To a "BOY" full of treacherous and insidious imperialistic overtones, I, filled with passionate blood, willingly say "YES". This point often swirls in my mind. Facing the blue sky and the white earth, I give an unconscious bitter smile, not knowing why. Surrounded by darkness, I feel that economics can bury a person's will. Pitiful me, hopeless me, forever embracing pessimism.</p>
<h3>Heterosexual Patient by Wen Zi</h3>
<p>"Hey Lao Zhou, wanna go for a coffee?" Li asked this as he was dragging Zhou to the Republican Restaurant. Originally, Li and Zhou weren't very close. Although they were in the same school, they had never had a long conversation except for nodding when they met. But now, things were different. He looked for Zhou every day to talk and have coffee. On Saturdays, they went to see movies. It seemed as if they were very close and almost inseparable. Originally, his messy hair was now coated with Stacornb and combed like an electric light bulb. Originally, he wore tattered Zhongshan clothing (note: not a mistake for Zhongshan suit, but means a long gown that is not long), but now he was wearing a sharp western suit. Originally, he was a good student who only read books in his room, but now he was often circling in the playground and corridors. In short, everything about him before was not everything about him now.</p>
<p>Soon, through his special intentions and skillful means, he was introduced by a useful person to the beautiful Miss Wang.</p>
<p>Not many days after Li met Ms. Wang, an interesting piece of news broke out in the school. It spread from one or two people's mouths to the ears of the entire school. They said,</p>
<p>"At around 6 o'clock on a certain day, three or five minutes after the dinner bell rang, Li was kissing Ms. Wang under the soccer goalpost in the northeast corner (note: kissing means 'Kiss')."</p>
<p>After this noisy rumor pierced Li's eardrums, he knew things were a bit bad and was so scared that he didn't dare to leave the dormitory. The next day, he heard, "There's a school affairs meeting today!" He immediately jumped up, thinking that the school affairs meeting would punish him for yesterday's events. He panicked and rushed to Mr. Lu, who had considerable influence, to beg for help. But in reality, the school affairs meeting had nothing to do with his affairs.</p>
<p>After being severely punished by this scare, he seemed to no longer be as eager to pursue the opposite sex as before.</p>
