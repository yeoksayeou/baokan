<p>時評</p>
<h3>積極造産（一）</h3>
<p>排斥日貨。爲我國國民以無抵抗之態度。促使日本覺悟其對我暴力壓迫。卽爲自殺之一種最後萬不獲已之手段。此種行動。旣無官方之協助。亦無暴烈之舉措。全國國民激於愛國熱忱。自起行動。其最終之目的。决非爲增殖中日兩民族間之仇恨。亦非爲一種拳來脚往之狹量報復。更非爲桎梏兩民族間息息相關之經濟生活。而爲欲以此無息無聲而有力之抗議。印入感覺敏銳之日本國民之心。使其了然於對華侵略之非計。而重新以眞誠和平互助之精神。携手共進。以謀兩國之繁榮。此種忍泣吞聲艱苦卓絶之行動。其動機固由愛護自國。然謂愛護日本。固亦未嘗不可也。</p>
<p>我國排斥日貨。迄於今日已復至八次。第一次在一九○八。歷時七個月。第二次在一九○九年歷。時八個月第。三次在一九一五年歷。時七個月。第四次在一九一八年。歷時六個月。第五次在一九一九年。歷時五個月。第六次在一九二五年。歷時三個月。第七次在一九二八年。歷時十個月。今茲則爲第八次。矣依歷次經觀之。每一次運動開始。日本對我貿易。卽頓時蒙受鉅大損失。貿易上一發生阻滯。彼國内更迅速地感到金融吃緊及失業增多之騷擾。商人之怨對。與工人这嘆恨。卽洋溢道途。故日人每一次直接對我壓迫。卽無異於間接對己迫害。日本有識之士。於此最應深切認淸。</p>
<p>我國人以經濟絶交之手段。對日作消極之抗議。二十年來連續八次。不可謂不多。然迄於目前。日人之對我侵凌如故也。我國家之積弱亦如故也。此其故安在。吾人固亦不得不一爲深思。</p>
<p>記者以爲吾人今後對於排斥外貨之觀念。應澈底認淸其眞實意義。卽不應僅認此種行動爲折服强敵之一種暫時手段。而應認爲立國之根本大計。最要者更應提倡國貨。不應出於一時之剌激。而應養成永恒之心理。蓋排斥外貨。爲求其在人。消極之抗禦也。此種消極之抗禦。在某一時固可顯其偉大之効力。提倡國貨。則爲求其在我。積極之自衞也。此種積極之自衞。基礎固。收効宏。强我國家。興我民族。皆在於此。故國人今日亟應移其求之於人之觀念。反而求諸自我。變其一時之昂奮感情。養成永矢不易之永恒心理。人人以提倡國貨爲己責。以用外貨爲可恥。日用之需。皆先求諸國貨。非必不獲己。不用外貨。能如是。則外貨自絀。國貨自興。國用自富。民　生自裕。</p>
<p>進一步言之。提倡國貨。亦有消極與積極之分。本國現有自製之貨物。切實提倡購用。消極也。其未有者。集合全力。自起製造。以謀自給。不復仰給於人。積極也。故吾人今日。不應僅講排貨。尤應提倡國貨。不應僅提倡國貨。尤應努力造産。善哉上海機聯合之言。「我人自救之方。厥爲採取自給自足政策。努力造産。制其來源。無顯　反抗之形。收發展實業之効。以言救國。莫善於此。」丁　　此危急。凡我國人。其一深思。</p>

<p>▲萬四千人雨中觀戰</p>
<p>奥斯汀與鮑羅屈拉比賽時、細雨如絲、迨柯顯脫與白里入塲雨勢漸大此種决賽决賽、應否舉行、乃一疑問、但觀衆譁噪　球員乃不得不勉强應命實則塲地濕滑、欲得一穩固立足地、極不易得迨後觀者在雨中觀戰、其歡呼狂呌之熱烈全忘其在風雨中也觀者當有萬四千人、</p>
<p>▲白里先勝後敗可惜</p>
<p>白里敗於柯顯脫、萬分可惜、佔得上風、卒歸失敗、第一第三兩盤俱如是、第一盤、白里先得四比一、結果連失五局、而以四比六敗、第二盤白又先得四局、利顯脫才得一局、白以六比一大勝、第三盤白又以五比二佔先、豈知接連失敗、竟戰至十六局、而爲柯所勝、第四局柯顯脫大展抱負、勝來不費工夫、二年中之最佳表演也、</p>
<p>▲法人狂歡球場變色</p>
<p>柯顯脫之勝、在其不可捉摸之戰術、白里抽擊甚得動、柯常爲其壓殺、但不能抵禦法將之猛攻、</p>
<h3>世界網球大王柯顯脫獲勝後之神氣</h3>
<p>比問告畢、法人興奮若狂、陽傘、草帽、坐墊、報紙、紛紛擲入球場、致使球場變頓成垃圾堆、亦奇觀也、</p>
<p>▲勝負成敗全在雙打</p>
<p>英國一九一二年得却令治權後、今年横除羣雄、才再重人决賽週、功虧一簣、三比二依然失敗、其成敗關鍵、卽在缺一强有力之雙打隊、單打法方一强一弱、而二英將則平均、故單打形勢平均、决勝負卽在雙打、誰家得勝、誰家得標也、</p>
<p>▲柯顯愛脫法國功臣</p>
<p>法國今年繼續保持勝利、全仗柯顯脫一人、鮑羅屈拉單打二組竟完全失敗、所靠柯大顯英雄本色、失敗奥斯汀、繼勝白里、又與勃羅能搭配勝英國休士及金斯萊、連戰三日、連勝三天、法國再能保持一年、柯氏一人之力耳、</p>

<h3>中國教育的一箇新方面</h3>
<p>—中央政治學校（二）野星</p>
<p>具餘還有幾個附設的特别班、如西康學生特别訓練班、共有三十三人、訓練四月、業已期滿畢業、測騐工作人員養成所、共有學生二十八人、訓練六個月、亦已畢業、蒙藏華僑、學生特别訓練班共二十四人、訓練二年有半於本年度期滿畢業、這三個附設的特别中、以蒙藏僑學生特别班的訓練期發久故成績亦最佳、另外還有一個蒙藏班、是去年十月開始訓練的、有學生五十四人訓練二年畢業、這個特别班的教育、除注重於普通社會科學外、　特别注重於農業牧畜等問題、以爲改革蒙藏的游牧生活社會準備、下半年另設一個華僑班、招收各地華僑靑年、不過這一班現在還没有正式成立、近來國民政府爲興辦改革全國的統計及會計起見、並爲大學畢業生謀給以專門知識與技能、俾以出路起見、已屢次商議、由中央政治學校、設立統計及會計兩專門班、招收大學已畢業的學生、訓練之期、以一年半至二年爲度、嚴格訓練、畢業以後、由國民政府派遣工作、但是由於校舍之不敷、現在還没有開辦、等到相當期以後、這兩種特别班也有開辦的可能、</p>
<p>因爲該校紀律的嚴肅和學風的良好、所以大家很因爲他怎樣能辦到這個地方而未注意他的訓育方針、中央政治學校現在的訓育工作是和教務打成一片的設有訓育委員會由各系的主任和專任教授擔任指導學生學業之修養及課外作業、該校認爲軍事訓練、爲整個訓育的重要部份、所以該校的軍事訓練、不只是兵式操而已並且包括軍事訓練至重要部份軍事管理、把學生編爲一大隊、更分做若干隊及若干區隊、由有軍事知識及受過長久軍事訓練的人員擔任、不止注重形式而且注重軍之精神、養成整齊嚴肅、刻苦耐勞敏捷簡當等項軍人之重要道行、學生的生活、極有規律、如每天六時、奏了起床號後、一律要起床、並由隊長率領跑步、奏上課號後、一律上課、絶無遲到及不到之弊、吃飯號嗚嗚地一響、全體到操場上結成隊伍、魚貫而入飯堂、絲毫不亂在没有聽到就寢號以前、宿舍裏面是雅雀無聲、没有一個人影的、就寢號過了、全體學生都在寢室裏、找他們黑甜鄉的滋味去了、因此學生的行動及習慣、都是很紀律化、秩序化、該校的學生生活、除了求知以外、更爲一種很團結的軍人生活、如寢室之整理、床位的佈置丨這都是軍隊中所謂内務丨都是很有規律、而天天要經隊長檢查過的、因爲要求整齊與劃一、所以制服和軍毯、都是由學校發給的、學費與宿費、當然没有、並且每月八元之膳費與三元之津貼、</p>

<h3>尼泊爾近狀及其最初臣服之略史</h3>
<p>— 天恨</p>
<p>自去年尼泊爾侵藏之消息傳佈以來。國人始注意此東亞之一小邦。知其國雖小。尚爲東亞完全自主之國。吾人嘗以暹羅能爲我所不能焉。居然對外取銷不平等條約。收回領事裁判權爲異。不意尼泊爾居印度西藏之間。屢受强英侵陵。竟始終不屈。與訂平等和約。至今英人猶不敢覬觎也。以視暹羅。又不可同日語。而所謂神明華胄之上國。乃不振至此。寗不媿煞。尼泊爾一名廓爾喀。在喜馬拉耶山南麓。面積五萬餘方里。當我江蘇一省。國都曰加德滿都。人口約六百萬。半爲廓爾喀族信婆羅門教。半爲尼泊爾族。春喇嘛教。而政權則操諸廓爾喀族之手。國王之下。有軍·政·財·法·農·工·商七大長官。常備軍祗八萬人。分駐各處。另有禁衞軍二萬人。拱衞京都。又有侍衞軍萬人。守護王宫。又鐵騎禁軍五千人。服古代甲胄。腰間左備利劍。右懸短砲。復有後備軍十萬人。平時爲農爲商。皆所不問。惟每年須會操三次。有事時頃刻可召集成軍。全國多山。故無鐵路。國都亦在兩山對峙中。祗有爬山車爲交通利器。製造廠則全國共有八所。製造古武刀劍及新式槍砲。所製刀劍。鋒銳而耐久用。著名世界。當英軍吞栟不丹後。卽欲兼吞尼泊爾。以爲蕞爾小國。囊中物耳。詎尼軍驍勇善戰。益以地勢關係。尼軍爬山越嶺。如履平地。英軍向所未習。屢犯皆敗。卒締平等和約。承認尼泊爾爲東亞完全自主國。以迄於今。尼國昔爲我藩屬。猶懷漢德。故遇漢人甚善。遇英人反有傲慢意。英人亦無如之何。今吾漢人亦頗以尼泊爾爲我藩屬爲快慰。而其最初臣服之歷史。則知之者甚尠。爰併誌之、事在淸乾隆時。該國原係蠻民雜居。分葉楞·布顔·　木三部·嗣爲西境酋長布拉吞併。稱廓爾喀國。彼時班禪喇嘛係第六世。因高宗萬壽。至京祝嘏。得賞賜及王公大臣布施甚豐。方擬回藏忽病痘而死。隨從奉骸骨歸葬。資財則爲班禪之兄仲巴胡士克圖所吞没。不唯不布施寺院。卽其弟瑪爾巴。亦不能分潤半文。遂憤而入廓爾喀。慫恿犯藏。高宗初命侍衞巴忠。將軍鄂輝·成德等。援藏征廓。巴忠等畏事。按兵不戰。與廓王調和。誘令遣使入貢。令西藏歲給五千金爲條件。又不明告西藏。廓軍暫退、巴忠等亦還。已而廓王向西藏索歲幣。其事乃白。高宗大怒。命嘉勇公福康安爲將軍。超勇公海蘭察爲參贊。大舉征廓。海蘭察爲當時名將。每戰必勝。淸軍直入廓境。廓王窮蹙求和。不許。淸軍再進。直逼國都。廓王求援印度。雖允而師久不至。（時印度已爲英屬）勢愈蹙。不得已卑詞求和。福康安許之。遂定爲藩屬。受册封。五年一貢。終淸之世不叛。宣统初。猶遣使入貢。以革命道阻而罷。有淸高宗之世。安南·緬甸·暹羅·琉球·高麗等國。均受册封。奉表納貢。豈料有今日耶。噫。</p>
<h3>霪雨歎</h3>
<p>— 冥飛</p>
<p>金陵大雨兼旬。街衢積水數尺。昔杜少陵秋雨之歎。無此愁慘矣。作霪雨歎。</p>
<p>隂雲一合慘不開。大雨又續細雨來淅淅兼旬雨不止。我屋高壁生莓苔。東窗攤害不見日。絃緩早知琴薦溼。潤到指尖棋子寒。墨隨膠解不成汁。輙生　居一事不可爲。張蓋攝屐出門欲何之。長安大街潦水積數尺。便看牽舟入市嬉羣兒。通衢自如此。委巷夫何如。飢餓不得出門戸。沈竈産蛙民其魚。我聞當年築馳道。斥金百萬苦恨少。舊時澮盡截塞。新者溝澮殊草草。年年雨集水不流。居人　𨇾溝水頭。治水民居以爲壑。海客自詡談瀛洲。瀛洲烟波隔微茫。想像仙山相驚忙。一盲衆盲遞相引。惟有恒雨徵其狂已矣哉。阿翁痴聾寗作瞽。生兒但學鮮卑語。高踞城頭駡漢人。好向雷門誇布鼓。</p>
<h3>九逍遙鳴</h3>
<p>— 蟄存</p>
<p>九逍遙。俗呼九頭鳥。其狀實係九頭。故名。山海經謂爲大海鳥之一種也。予鄉地瀕東海。約二百里。近接鬬龍新洋兩港口。居人以九逍遙鳴占風雨。惟聞其聲從未見其頭。聞於夜從未聞於晝。其聲悠揚而小。如一羣雄雌小鳥相和鳴也。出鳴必有風雨。或大風雨。百試不爽。夜深聞之。令人悽然。予童年偶聞其聲。頗爲駭懼。疑在空際。相距不遠。卽奔赴先慈處、依依膝下。不敢至他室。其實鳴聲甚大。蓋風雨將至時。覺毛翮間燥癢難禁。飛必冲霄。翺翔海上以自適。其飛旣高。鳴聲自能及遠。數百里外聞之。似覺其聲不大也。航海客偶於夜間望見之。其翼足以敝天日。戚繼光紀效新書。載有航海風雨占騐多則。内有九逍遙出占風雨。一聲風。兩聲雨。三聲四聲斷風雨云云。惟其性非風雨不起。旣飛鳴而出。可决其必有風雨也。戚書所載。尚非實有經騐之談。本月間隂雨經旬未止。入夜卽聞其鳴聲。悽風苦雨。遠近皆成澤國。低處水已成災。故特誌之。</p>
<h3>美國婦女生活雜談（二）</h3>
<p>— 寄</p>
<p>嗜好　在兩三年以前。麻雀牌曾一度風行美國。婦女們視爲高尚的游藝。甚至廢寢忘食的作方城之戰。但現在大家都厭棄了。美國婦女。天性流動。凡是新奇的事物。趨之若鶩。過了鋒頭。誰也不去顧問。和東方民族保守的心理。根本上就有差别的。普通婦女大都嗜烟酒。美國禁酒雖然很嚴。但禁則禁。飲則飲。伊們在家裏依然在偷著喝酒。政府也没法去查禁的。香烟除中學女生以外。如大學女生。家庭閨秀。及有職業的女子。幾乎十之六喜歡吸的。在每個大學女生休憇室中。就可以看到許多女生在吸烟。不過伊們看什麽地方的。在街上走。在公園裏玩。或是正式的宴會。决不吸烟。因伊們最重禮貌。最守秩序。也最怕惹人討厭。電影。跳舞。騎馬。還是很盛行。跳舞在美國是人人都會的。這是盛大宴會及交際塲中來賓們的高尚娛樂。决不像海上專以營業爲目的。而貽社會人士以傷風敗俗的口實。其次在體育方面的嗜好。如考而夫。網球。都狠流行。現在夏季游泳更熱烈。在芝加哥密西根河畔。平均每日泅水的總在三萬人以上分析起來。十之六七是婦女。雖男子因爲職業上的關係。不及婦女那樣自由。然亦可見婦女們對於游泳興趣的濃厚了</p>
<p>▲社交　社交公開。在美國社會早就實行了。常人以爲男女間旣然公開交際。社會上不就閙出許多笑話來麽。其實並不然。因爲他們或伊們。都是有程度。很講禮貌。很有品格的人。彼此之間。不過打破一層隔膜。以禮相待。所謂「君子自重」。就不會有卑劣的思想和行爲了。男的認識許多女友。女的認識許多男友。但限於友誼而已。不會牽涉到戀愛或是婚姻上去。可見男女間平時接觸的機會愈多。倒可以免除許多意外的問題。否則雙方不能了解。一見異性。便以爲什麽都是神秘的。而引起好奇心的衝動了。所以認「社交公開」爲不黨。是錯誤的見解。在五年以前。美國西北大學女生與男生的人數。成三與一的比例。原因是附近村裡。富家很多。女子都有受大學教育的機會。那時候男女生交際的機會。自然更多了。依普通人心理的推測。豈不是給男生求愛的方便麽。然而據調查結果。男女學生從没有某與某發生過變愛的事實。足見社交是社交。戀愛是戀愛。二者不能併爲一談的。美國任何大學裡。每逢星期六。便舉行各種集會。聯絡同學們的感情。並舒暢疲憊的精神。有所謂級友會。兄弟會。妹姊會等。那種會裡有很多有趣的娛樂。如茶叙。談笑。音樂。跳舞……等、應有盡有。級友會男女都到。兄弟會會員都可以携女友偕來。姊妹會會員也可以携男友偕來。兩性間的交際。完全自由。不過二十歲以下。中學未畢業。智識能力薄弱的女子。家長總還有些限制的。</p>

<p>秋子是怪可憐愛的：伊彷彿是丁小姐的妹妹，丁太太也疼愛伊。平時，丁小姐在學校裏，家裏的一切事情，常常由秋子獨自料理，丁太太四十五歲了，每天的生活，祇是唸唸經。拜拜佛，其他的事，就不喜歡多管。丁小姐呢，與其說伊是嬌生貴養的姑娘，不如說伊是天眞未鑿的孩子。伊活潑的心情和美麗的容顔，受遍了許多人的愛慕，在學校之中，伊更是衆矢之的；可是伊自己却不以爲意。</p>
<p>祇有伊自己知道，也許秋子稍稍知道些，伊也有着伊比較密切的朋友的。因爲在假期之中，有什麽電話來，有什麽信來，總是秋子先接着，伊常常奇怪而又欣喜的，便是給丁小姐的電話的人，常常是一個男子的聲音，說是「姓李；」而寄來的信呢，有時一天一封，有時竟一天兩封，信封上也總是寫着「李緘。」</p>
<p>於是，秋子也常常給丁小姐開開頑笑：有時，聽見門鈴響了，便說是「李先生到來：」有時，還要笑着向丁小姐討李先生的照片看。丁小姐却從不動氣。這樣，在秋子的料想之中。事實便益發明瞭了。因此，「李先生究竟是怎樣一個人」的問題，已經很有力量地佔據在秋子的期望之中。</p>
<p>一天旁晚時候，秋子正在門前閒逛。突然有一個西裝的少年站住在伊的面前。伊立刻就感覺到這是從來没有知道過的一位不相識的來客；但是，同時，在伊敏捷的體會之中，居然已然肯定着這個不相識的來客，便是伊期望中的李先生了。</p>
<p>「這裏是丁公館麽？丁小姐在家不在家？」那個少年早就發問了。</p>
<p>「是的！小姐在家裏！你貴姓？」秋子自己笑起來了；伊後來就想到，這末一句話是多問的　。</p>
<p>然而，那個來客的回答，終於出乎秋子的意料之外了。當一聲「我姓陸」的聲音從那個少年的口中輕婉地吐出時，秋子實在有些奇怪了。</p>
<p>「請裏面坐！」秋子懷疑地領了那個陸先生到裏邊去。</p>
<p>到裏面去通報以後。秋子就瞧見丁小姐換了一件新製的長旗袍，又對着鏡子輕輕敷了一些粉。就急急地走向會客室中。</p>

<h3>銀根將有起色之見聞</h3>
<p>滬埠銀根鬆滯、繇來已久、當此夏令、更形寂寞、但厥後將有起色消息、究其主因、聞係洋麥到滬孔多、此項貨欵、亟亟待解、厥數尤巨、故昨日銀拆已見略好、而劃頭竟爾超出一錢以上、幾達二錢光景、按該業人言、昨日銀拆本欲高抬二錢左右、緣本月份爲日無多、對於全月銀拆之統計總額、誠恐超出二兩以外、故近數日强行壓小、大約過此月底、逆料必須上騰、卽無大漲、而至少總在一錢以外、如果金融界又有他種需要、則尤非吾人所及料、而銀根氣瀉之升騰、爲當然之事實云云、</p>

<p>昨公債七月期已爲最後一日市而、今日起卽須停拍、藉可準備交割、又昨日對於八月期賣出已取消現貨提供、改徵證金、藉便掉期、故市情大致尚不寂寞、而現貨交易依然甚淸、至言各債價之變動情形、因債市環象毫無變化、且迫近交割、大戸觀望不動、因之求供均衡、趣勢呆滯、前後市上落依然甚微、僅以市上零戸需要略旺、價比上週末一致稍漲、惟爲數祇在二三角左右、而整六關稅八月及金融七月續仍微跌、計全日現貨交易共六千元期貨達一千九百數十萬元、</p>

<h3>棉市氣象鬆懈</h3>
<p>美棉一味趨跌印度棉亦步塵於後、但外匯仍緊、本埠雨勢雖停、然各方棉田損害已大、新棉發育大受打擊、故内地帮購進心思異常濃厚、火機帮及甲帮依然抛賣、故壓迫尚重、未能站定、氣象頗鬆、</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市步漲</h3>
<p>▲新閘　昨日天時轉晴、内地來船仍少、祇十四五艘、本街走銷尚活、常錫厚粳鄉莊帮辦去一千四百担、形勢比前市亦增三角、崑山·溧陽白粳、大盤因銷爽價昂一二角、石浦·重固薄稻零銷尚殷、盤面又增五角零糯米酒作坊需要極好、致價步緊、南港早稻及洋杜尖到　價好角許、河下斛脚五千石、問周浦新粳已屆登塲、近五六天内當可到滬云、</p>

<h3>天晴粉價回疲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市已轉平軟之象、以天已放晴、業内外人心均已大熱、兼之洋麥報價、坎拿大竟跌一元左右、芝加哥三四五角左右、國外市情、如此不佳、目前雖無影響、結果則必源源而進所以人心見虛、一般買戸、曾有隨市回出者、故開盤各價、較前日曾落一分零、旋因某廠維持近期、意在暢抛遠期、津帮則亦略進、致疲滯之局、又轉穩定、照此情形、或恐又將盤旋惟全日成交、異常暢旺、達一百五十餘萬、結果本月份較前週小二厘半、八月份好二厘半、九月份小七釐半　十月份小五厘、十一十二月份小七釐半云、</p>
<h3>麥價大跌</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、呈急轉直下之勢、以天色放晴、洋麥報價又見大跌、如坎拿大跌一元左右、芝加哥跌三四五角、此種跌度、完全爲過剩之惡態、因此人心太爲震動、賣氣極暢、一般浮多亦亟亟回出、前幾日之漲度、至此完全削平、本月份祇一月交易、開價卽落四五分、下午投機浮多、曾抬至三兩七錢八分、最低祇六錢八分、差至一錢、遠期則一路向下、跌度甚大、計本月份跌三分、八九月份跌八分、十月份跌六分、十一月份跌七分、十二月份跌六分、現麥因標準及高貨缺少、喊起二三分、開直塘崑山雙鳳太倉横涇崇明蓬萊揚州麥共四千餘包、由福新進二千五百包、華豐進七百包、信大進八百餘包云、</p>
<h3>無錫新絲頭運到百餘件</h3>
<p>無錫今歲春夏繭均告歉收、而各絲廠開工者已達十之八九、新絲頭已有運滬、昨由振藝永泰等廠運到新絲廠長吐湯繭繭衣等一百五十五件、均由各該申莊提運回棧、分别佈樣云、</p>
<h3>歐美絲銷益無生氣</h3>
<p>昨滬白廠經、美銷依然停滯、英倫里昂等處亦因股市續疲。廠方觀望、進胃亦淡、市氣沉靜、昨祇三星進棉黄搖經三包、克昌等進黄粗絲十六包、價仍平定云、</p>
<h3>針秀眉歐銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源屯溪等路之針眉綠茶、英莊怡和協和錦隆同孚等行、均起搜辦、交易異常暢旺、售盤亦較上星期提漲四五兩、珍眉一項、抽芯貨略形走銷、低莊貨仍趨暢達、惟上中莊貨、洋行家因國外來價大緊、認盤未能放鬆故交易依然沉寂云、</p>
<h3>婺屯茶市近訊</h3>
<p>屯埠各號進茶胃量、在上月滬市銷暢價高時、莫不深憾搜辦之不多、故當時茶價、曾提漲至九十元外、迨子茶出新、羣獨望滬轉機、恢復前價、踴躍購進、盤價最高在亦提至七十元零、近鑒滬市久落難回、珍眉價縮、意興大减、目下主旨、多將已辦存茶、製畢完塲、各茶行囤積未售新茶、市盤每担驟跌至四十元零、較初開盤、僅一對拆、一般茶販受虧至巨、茶未市價、因店莊製日花茶片甚盛、去胃仍長、盤價尚在二十五六元之間、雖較前見跌三四元、比之去年以前盤價、仍屬最高價格云、</p>
<p>婺邑茶號、因本年春茶出産折减、進茶多未滿量、故對子茶出新、羣相競購、大衆心理、以滬市雖見疲弱、終當有回蘇之時、不料珍眉市價步低、俄莊協助會寂然迄無動辦意、大宗貢熙一項、因貨次不合他行銷胃、去路中斷、前之抱樂觀者、今均嘆茶市之難捉摸矣、一般茶販茶行收囤之子茶、前居奇未售者、今已無人問津、日來有茶在手之茶販、莫不奔走向號家求脫、雖落價每担三十元、仍多不願增進、幸市上存茶不多、影響較小、惟客販因求售無受主、市面轉瞬過時均甚焦急云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　抵制後之東貨</h3>
<p>▲暗中仍在活動……間有改裝郵包</p>
<p>▲本廠布　邇來上漲甚速、良以自抵制發生以來、日廠貨之細布·細斜首先上漲、現貨已搜羅一空、至昨客帮雖已不能裝運、但現貨仍軋缺、藍鷄售七兩六錢半、藍日七兩四錢半、喇叭童七兩七錢半、藍飛魚八兩、頗有無可搜羅之概、實以華廠貨相當代替之品、異常缺乏之故、細斜紋華廠貨昨已飛漲、金城八兩一錢、蝶球七兩六錢半、較前漲起達六錢左右、粗布各漲一錢、九磅之五福貓鷹紛紛五兩出關、十一磅已須五兩六錢半矣、</p>
<p>▲東西疋　前昨二日、一致沉悶、蓋東貨自被反日會大批扣留後、本客咸具戒心、走動已靜、但一部份客家已由郵局裝運、長江一帶有改裝日商報關行之勢、所以檢查無論嚴密、暗中仍在活動、就中貨價略跌、但現貨頗缺、實以從前所存之貨已完全出脫之故、莫干山直貢呢昨漢帮仍在搜辦、現貨甚缺、細嗶嘰·沙市長沙二帮均有購進、三友圖爲三錢四分、湖心亭三錢五分、西貨實大非昔比、普通通應銷之貨、實有無處搜羅之狀、條子板綾汕頭帮昨成交五十多件、價均二錢八七分、餘者舉動頗靜云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蘭竹枝到稀看漲</h3>
<p>上週首帮所到蘭竹枝曾開五十兩至四十八兩左右、以地價而論、確須虧耗、然地價仍未鬆、且反見升、故市勢轉挺、查昨濟南輪入口僅到十件、來源銳减、故後市勢必增漲、烏葉枝以走銷活潑、更有上升希望、預料當有二三兩上落云、</p>
<h3>糖市　劃盤交靜市挺</h3>
<p>▲太古糖喊漲二錢</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊仍乏到來、公會劃盤以外滙轉高、略見俏秀、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價爲十一兩四錢半、進出兩缺、市形尚堅、二十號中砂白十一兩、八號荷赤九兩二錢、磨細砂白十一兩五錢半、交易亦稀、太古車糖Ｂ嘜劃十二兩、後市至○五分、ＤＹ嘜十兩八錢、市象尚挺、惟該公司現貨則喊漲二錢、計Ｂ嘜需價十二兩三錢、划之定貨價格日金五元六角、尚覺便宜云、</p>

<h3>伍連德歸國後談話</h3>

<p>▲衞生委會　伍氏謂余於四月十一日出國、經西伯利亞赴歐、於二十七日抵日内瓦、出席國際聯盟衞生委員會、與國際第六十三次行政會議、以及最重要之世界麻醉品會議、衞生委員會僅報告我國衞生之進步情形、以及我國政府在衞生事宜上之每年用費、我國衞生事宜上、往時每年費用、祗有百餘萬元、近來已增至三百餘萬、足見我國衞生事冝之逐漸進展矣、</p>
<p>▲派員來華　第六十三次國聯行政會議、於五月十七日在日内瓦舉行、出席者有名國外交部長等共計十四人、余係代表財政部長宋子文出席、請其派委員來華、以顧問地位與性質助理我國財政交通及教育三項工作、現國聯會業已應允、將分三組派遣來華、每組大約爲三人、第一組先派教育委員、已定於九月一號到上海、財政交通兩組委員、現尚未定、大約不久亦可决定、卽行來華云、</p>

<p>▲鴉片大會　關於鴉片毒品之討論、因於東方關係較大、故决定於十一月七日、在暹羅舉行世界鴉片大會、屆時余恐不能出席、或由政府另派代表參加也、</p>
<p>▲防疫情形　伍氏最後謂本人自馬賽回國時、沿途在法意及印度新嘉坡斐律濱及香港等處、觀察各國商業情形、極爲蕭條到華後、復在汕頭厦門等處、視察我國南部海港防疫情形甚佳、自我國將防疫工作由外人手中收回自辦後、頗有迅速之進步、現此項工作、收回僅六越月、卽已有秙院等設施、在外人手中數年、亦無此成績、足見我國各事、如不求其進步則已、欲求進步、亦極易事也云云、</p>

<h3>上海租界略史</h3>
<p>— 鐵華</p>
<p>岑德彰編譯　世界大東代售</p>
<p>値此全國一致、努力收回租界運動的時機、我以爲這本「上海租界略史」的編譯、是很好、一種貢獻、所以特地在此紹介給國人、作爲參考的材料、史乘的談助、</p>
<p>關於上海的租界史、恐怕不明瞭的人士很多、我們只知道租界的起源、由於雅片戰役的失敗、開闢商埠起始、但其中怎樣的經過、以及逐步擴充的變遷、我想凡爲國人、都應注意到的、在這本書裏、於是告訴我們所急迫要知道的種種、</p>
<p>此書係岑德彰君根據卜舫濟所著的Ａ　Ｓhort　History　of　Shanghai一書、再傍稽羣書、就故老徵訪所得、編譯而成、全書計三百六十餘頁、首附上海租界大事年表、自淸道光二十二年八月二十九日中英簽訂南京和約起始、迄民國十九年止、將租界大事訂成年表、全部共分二十八章、計訂約通商、創設租界、紅頭據城、修訂章程、太平戰禍、市政規模、營造概况、四明公所、發展交通、重修章程、教育基礎、五旬慶典、工業革命、推廣租界、庚子拳亂、辛丑和約、大閙公堂、越界築路、武昌起義、起兵討袁、歐陸戰禍、力抗附律、臨城車刦、齊盧戰爭、五卅慘案等等、每章再各分小目數十則、租界史事、舉凡無遺、這種搜羅、實非易易、</p>
<p>全書甚長、難於一一細舉、茲約略介紹一二、其關於租界緣起的記載、</p>
<p>「上海於淸道光二十二年（一八四三年）十一月十四日宣佈爲通商口岸、璞鼎查在約中旣未提及租界、其事乃留待貝爾福與滬道互商解决、時中國官廳反對設立租界、以爲出賣土地、有違國法、後乃改賣絶爲永租、租戸年納租金若干、是時地價每畝約値制錢十五串至三十五串、而售於外人時、則索價至五六十串、（約合洋五六十元）每年租錢、約制錢一串五百文、」</p>
<p>其述租界之經界、</p>
<p>「租界四至、初未劃定、大約東至黄浦江、南至洋涇浜、北至今之北京路、而西方則漫無經界、嗣乃劃界路爲界、卽今之河南路也、計第一次劃入租界之地、爲一百五十哀克、（英畝）………………」</p>
<p>在咸豐同治年間、書裏有一段旅滬外僑生活狀况的寫眞、「每日必至跑馬塲試馬、態度瀟閒、其有喜作淸談者、則羣往黄浦灘、時灘道極寬長與租界相等、晨間担夫麕集、迨夕陽西下、則洋商土女、聯翩徐步、其一種和樂之狀、凡隨使節東來者、莫不認上海爲中國之樂土云、」</p>
<p>自太平軍興、兵臨上海、淸庭不惜乞助於外人、加入戰團、現今外灘公園樹有常勝軍碑者、便是李鴻章酬勛而立、無賴洋人華爾、卽初次統率洋軍以助淸庭的、所以戰死之後、便列名於碑首了、</p>
<p>迨後市政規模、日趨開展、工部局成立、英美租界合併、有改租界爲自由市的意思、換句話講、便是以上海租界爲一獨立共和國、當時的英領麥華佗（Ｗ·Ｈ·Ｍedburst）却還能主持正義、說「此一片土原屬中國、不過允任締約諸國、得於是行使其領事裁判權耳、初未嘗對於中國之土地人民、放棄其主權也、」英使布羅其也加反對、說「上海租界之性質、旣非割讓、亦非租借、凡吾人所有之地産、仍屬中國之領土也、」但是、八十餘年的遷延、到現在、竟成了什麽一種現象呢、</p>
<p>全書搜羅旣富、要一一的舉出來、實在不如整個的翻閱來得貫澈、所以不再想多費筆墨、不過於極司非而路的緣起一段故老傳說得很有趣味、「考極司非而之得名、其中尚有一段軼聞艷事、據聞當年有葡萄牙人某君者、偶行經虹口馬戲塲側、聞帳中有女、哭聲甚哀、乃爲之贖身、送交某美教士撫養、女後得某君之談、赴美留學、歸國後遂歸某君、以女名極司、乃戲呼其地爲極司非而、」像此類記載、書中甚多、也不必多舉、徒占篇幅、</p>
<p>總之、這本書、雖稱上海租界略史、其容量已屬具體、的確爲我人所必欲讀的一部史書、當記者携帶在電車裏看時、很有許多人殷殷以出版處見訊、足徵注意及租界史的人很多、而更亟、那末、此書的價值和出版的意義、母庸我再多嘵舌子、</p>
<p>本書售價二元、或可打一九扣、我意再版時、可縮小字體、减少紙張、售價從廉、以期普及、敢進言於編譯者岑先生、</p>
<h3>三民主義與人口政策</h3>
<p>— 世槐</p>
<p>陳長蘅著</p>
<p>關於人口問題和人口政策的書、用中文寫作的、我已看過好多本、有幾本是太簡單、有幾本是不簡單了、可是又失之太陳舊、有數本似乎比較好些了、可惜牠們是從外國譯來的、牠們的背景與立塲不是中國、似乎在我個人有了一層隔膜、要在現在國人自己的關於人口問題和人口政策的出版物中、可算作一本好書的、</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>我想舍現在我所要介紹的這本「三民主義與人口政策」外、另外是不能多打得的了、</p>
<p>這本書的作者陳長蘅先生、　是現在國民政府立法院的立法委員、他從事研究人口問題、至少應該有十年了、他最的著作是「中國人口論」、一本介紹馬爾薩斯學說與反對新馬爾薩斯主義的書、以後、在「東方雜誌」在「現代評論」、在「中國評論週報」上、都有關於人口問題的論文發生、本書是他彚集十數年來研究中國人口數量和西洋的自然環境社會環境及遺傳對於種族進化諸說的所得、及由研究所得創生的普遍的生育革命、</p>
<p>本書分十二章、共三百四十二頁、可以說是一部巨著、各章的題目如下、第一章、中山先生人口理論的總分科、第二章、人口問題爲澈底實現三民主義的先决問題、第三章、中國人口總數的新推測、第四章、如何維持「超出物種原則」的人口密度、第五章、人口密度與人生標準、第六章、關與品質方面的人口政策、第七章、自然環境與種族進化之關係、第八章、遺傳優劣與種族進化之關係、第九章、習慣良窳文化優劣與種族進化之關係、第十章、生育革命的積極意義博愛精神和科學基礎、第十一章、生育革命的具體方案與政府應有的指導設施、第十二章結論、</p>
<p>本書對於外國學者如威爾柯克斯（Ｗillior）之相信宣統二年民政部之戸口調查「全國人口三萬二千萬」是眞確的、力加批駁、他引證許多少報戸口的縣分、以及每戸人數四三人之不確、他於是釐訂的結果宣統二年的人口應爲三萬八千五百萬、他並計得中國近十八年來的平均人口增加率是千分之十一、比世界人口的平均增加率千分之八稍爲多些、由此他更計得現在我國的人口總數應爲四萬七千萬、我們不是常說四萬萬嗎、他現在是將這舊說推翻了、他告訴我們中國現時的人口是太多了、我們現時適合的人口是二萬五千萬、而且我們的人口是六十年增加一倍、</p>
<p>陳長蘅先生極力申說人口數量對於人口品質的關係、一個過飽和的人口密度、其自然淘汰作用是反選擇的居多數、因而他以爲一個政府應該制定一個時中的人口密度、在這時中的人口密度裏、最高的人生標準纔得以維持、</p>
<p>普遍的生育革命便是陳先生爲欲制定時中的人口密度所創的人口政策、普遍的生育革命的意義有三、（一）可免除國際競爭焦點、齊一國際文化進差、以促進世界的大同、（二）可以减少苦樂時差苦樂地差、和苦樂人差以增高人生的價値和人類的幸福、（三）可以减少苦樂性差和男女數差以維持兩性的數量平衡及增進兩性的共同幸福、</p>
<p>他的具體方案是、（一）取締宗法式的早婚和納妾、（二）實行一枝花和二枝花（卽一男一女和二男二女）、（三）生育革命應以政府爲主要訓導保育機關、</p>
<p>末了、我引用本書的結論作爲本篇的結束、「……我們要在這種可親可近可愛可敬的領袖指導之下、我們中國的民族纔能夠眞正的得救、我們靑天白日、美玉無暇、至聖至神、永表東亞的新烏託邦纔能夠安穩健全的産生出來、我們全國人民纔能永遠享更爲高尚文明、更爲豐富康强、更爲公正純善、更爲親愛自由、更爲完全美滿、更爲光榮神聖的共同生活個人生活、我們未來如荼如錦的新烏託邦、就是我們全民共有的新天國、也就是我們由「中國一人」以達到「天下一家」所必由之路」、</p>

<h3>看了聯合影展後</h3>
<p>— 光楣</p>
<p>雖不能說是空前的創舉、但究屬是很少見的機會、一切文明占全國之首的上海、中西繪畫的展覽、倒是時常可以看到、攝影展覽、却不常見、很外的以往、時報館曾開過攝影展覽會、我亦屬參觀者之一、可惜他所給我的印象、除了讚嘆佩服作者的手段高明外、再没有其他什麽特别的感覺了、其實、就是像那樣普通的展覽、還不能常常給我們看到、</p>
<p>突如其來的給我們以一個向所渴念著的要求、聯合攝影展覽會、在北四川路儉德公寓公開展覽兩星期、其中最主要的作者、是盧施福先生與郎靜山先生、盧的作品占多數、這兩位先生對於攝影的研究、藝術的高超、久爲一般人士所景仰、不過、我對於盧君的成績、却不得不驚奇呌絶、原來盧施福君是一位頗負盛名的德醫、不想對於攝影藝術、竟有如此高明、</p>
<p>在已往的攝影展覽會中、我們只看到風景、靜物、還有美麗的摩登姑娘的玉影、却少見到注意及人體方面、人體攝影、可以說很難找到、盧郎二君的作品裏、在這方面、頗能注意、盧的作品裸體、美人尤占多數、例如「羞」、便是一幅極美的畫圖、由這次的展覽看來、毅然地剷除了我一向對於攝影不及繪畫易於表現底武斷的陳見、我現在是這樣的講了、攝影與繪畫是不相上下的、只要得法、是一樣的有聲有色、這個糾正是盧郎二君所給予我的呵、我應該感謝、</p>
<p>盧郎二君能夠注意到人體、當然是值得佩服、可是、却有一端、陳列著的人體作品、盡屬女性、倒是一個小小的値得討論的問題、我希望盧郎二君從今後能注意到男性方面、表現强健勇敢的男性美、同時、希望在下屆展覽的時候、能有更多琳瑯滿目的作品、陳在我們的眼前、</p>

<p>Shi's Forces Adopt Defensive Posture</p>
<p>Five Bridges Blown Up</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Liu Zhi's forces of the Pinghan Southern Route Army captured Handan and continued their northward advance, battles have occurred on the front lines for days. Hu Zongnan is commanding at the very front, and the northern and southern armies simultaneously issued a total attack order last night, advancing against Shi's forces. The northern front line is in the Xinle area, where Shi's forces are in a dispersed line. The majority of the Northeastern Army is concentrated there.</p>
<p>The attack is fierce. The front-line units are the Du Jiwu and Bai Fengxiang brigades. Shi's forces have suffered many casualties. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At one o'clock this morning, a plane from Nanyuan, piloted by Zhu Changkai, flew to the front line to scout Shi's forces. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Shi Yousan has changed his plan and adopted a defensive posture. Shi's front line was originally south of Qingfengdian, but Shi's army is no longer visible there. Last night, four hundred of Shi's plainclothes troops were routed by the Northeastern machine gun squad. Defensive works of Shi's army were discovered south of Qingfengdian. Shi's forces are using that location as the first line of defense, with the second line of defense in Shijiazhuang, Wuji, and Shenze. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Shi's rebel forces gathered in Shunde on the 19th and advanced north, making contact with the Northeastern Army on the 22nd. When Shi's forces moved north along the Pinghan Line, Vice-Commander Zhang dispatched over thirty aircraft, and the Kaifeng Headquarters also sent ten aircraft south of Shijiazhuang, dropping over seventy bombs. The rebel army was thrown into chaos, and the Northeastern Army took the opportunity to attack, inflicting a major defeat on Shi. They retreated dozens of *li* south.

<p>(Nanjing) News from the military front: the Northeastern troops have strong forces on the Pinghan and Jinpu Lines. The advance team on the Pinghan Road is in the Changshou and Xinle areas. On the 26th, about two regiments of enemy forces launched a fierce attack on Guo Zhuang. Our army used machine guns to mow them down. The enemy could not withstand it and retreated back across the river. Wang Shuchang's troops have established contact with the Pinghan Road and are blocking the enemy's eastward advance. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Huanxiang and Yu Xuezhong have already agreed on a detailed plan for joint operations by the land and air forces, which has been submitted to Vice-Commander Zhang for approval.

<p>(Kaifeng) A report from Zhangde states that when Shi's forces left Zhangde, they appointed Guo, the manager of the Yuxin Cotton Mill, as the independent brigade commander of the 2nd Division of the 5th Group Army, concurrently serving as the Zhangde garrison commander, and left weapons stored in the mill. After our army arrived in Zhangde and learned of the situation, they immediately dispatched a team to surround and confiscate the weapons. Guo fled upon hearing the news. Also, when Shi left Zhangde, he took dozens of prisoners from the county government prison to replenish his troop numbers. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) The 23rd Brigade captured Zhu Guozhi, the bogus brigade commander appointed by Shi, as well as regimental commander Liu Yuntong and adjutant Wang Youfeng.

<p>Red Bandit Headquarters Occupied</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanchang Dispatch: (1) Jiang telegraphed He Chengjun, instructing him to consult with He Jian and jointly suppress the bandits who have infiltrated the border region between Hunan and Hubei. Since the bandits in Jiangxi have not been cleared, he plans to temporarily refrain from going to Wuhan. (2) Jiang, noting that the various bandits are holed up in Donggu, Xingguo, Yudu, and Ruijin, in extremely dire straits, telegraphed the frontline generals, ordering them to vigorously encircle and suppress them from the 28th onward, setting a one-day deadline to completely recapture the various bandit areas and thoroughly annihilate the Red bandits.

However, due to the capture of Ningdu and the encirclement of Donggu, the situation has disintegrated, and the bandit leaders have scattered. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) A certain important person said that Jiang has entrusted Vice-Commander Zhang and Liu Zhi to handle the rebellion of Shi Yousan's forces, which will absolutely not affect the suppression of the Communists. Although the majority of the bandits have fled to Minxi (western Fujian), he will not rest until the bandits in Fujian are resolved. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Salt Tax Bond</h3>
<p>Issue Amount: 20 Million Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance previously planned to issue 20 million yuan in salt tax bonds to enrich the national treasury, but it could not be implemented due to other reasons. Now, with the anti-Communist campaign underway and military expenditures being enormous, and with revenue not being sufficient after the abolition of *li* taxes, it is necessary to proceed according to the original plan.

<h3>Actively Creating Production (1)</h3>
<p>Boycotting Japanese goods, as a means by which our nation's citizens offer resistance with a non-violent attitude and cause Japan to awaken to the violence it inflicts in its oppression of China, is a form of suicide that is only to be used as a last resort. This action lacks official assistance and avoids violent acts. The nation's citizens, moved by patriotic fervor, have begun acting on their own. Their ultimate purpose is certainly not to increase the hatred between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, nor is it a petty measure of tit-for-tat revenge. It is even less intended to shackle the closely interconnected economic lives of both nations. Rather, the goal is to imprint this silent but powerful protest on the sensitive hearts of the Japanese people, making them understand the folly of aggression against China, and to work together in sincerity, peace, and mutual assistance to seek the prosperity of both countries. This arduous and resolute action, of gritting one's teeth and swallowing one's tears, is motivated by love for one's own country, but it can also be said that it is also motivated by love for Japan.</p>
<p>Our country's boycott of Japanese goods has occurred eight times. The first was in 1908, lasting seven months. The second was in 1909, lasting eight months. The third was in 1915, lasting seven months. The fourth was in 1918, lasting six months. The fifth was in 1919, lasting five months. The sixth was in 1925, lasting three months. The seventh was in 1928, lasting ten months. This time is the eighth. According to past observations, each time a movement begins, Japan's trade with us immediately suffers huge losses. Once trade is obstructed, financial strain and increased unemployment are rapidly felt within their country. The grievances of merchants and the sighs of workers overflow into the streets. Therefore, each time the Japanese directly oppress us, it is no different from indirectly harming themselves. Discerning people in Japan should deeply recognize this.</p>
<p>Our people have used the means of economic disengagement to passively protest against Japan eight times over the past twenty years, which is not insignificant. However, up to now, the Japanese aggression against us remains the same, and our country's weakness also remains the same. Why is this so? We must deeply reflect on this.</p>
<p>This reporter believes that in the future, our understanding of boycotting foreign goods should thoroughly recognize its true meaning, that is, we should not only recognize this action as a temporary means of subduing a powerful enemy, but we should recognize it as a fundamental plan for establishing a nation. Most importantly, we should promote domestic goods. This should not be out of temporary stimulation, but should cultivate an eternal mindset. Boycotting foreign goods is seeking solutions from others, a passive defense. This passive defense can show its great effectiveness at a certain time. Promoting domestic goods is seeking solutions from ourselves, an active defense. This active defense has a solid foundation and yields significant results. Strengthening our country and revitalizing our nation all depend on this. Therefore, today, our people should urgently shift their mindset of seeking solutions from others and instead seek them from ourselves. We must change our temporary excited emotions and cultivate an unchanging, eternal mindset. Everyone should take promoting domestic goods as their own responsibility and consider using foreign goods as shameful. Daily needs should all first seek domestic goods. Unless it is absolutely necessary, do not use foreign goods. If we can do this, then foreign goods will naturally be reduced, domestic goods will naturally flourish, the country's finances will naturally be enriched, and the people's livelihood will naturally be improved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, promoting domestic goods also has passive and active aspects. Earnestly promoting the purchase and use of domestically produced goods that already exist is passive. Gathering all efforts to begin manufacturing those that do not yet exist to achieve self-sufficiency and no longer relying on others is active. Therefore, today, we should not only talk about boycotting foreign goods, but also promote domestic goods. We should not only promote domestic goods, but also strive to create production. How well said is the Shanghai Machine Union's statement: "The way for us to save ourselves is to adopt a policy of self-sufficiency, strive to create production, control the sources, avoid showing overt resistance, and achieve the effectiveness of developing industry. In terms of saving the country, there is nothing better than this." In this crisis, all of our compatriots should deeply reflect on this.</p>
<p>Important Domestic Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Reports on the Wanbao and Korean Cases</h3>
<p>Defends Against Public Criticism</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 27th and immediately attended the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' memorial week, reporting on the Wanbao and Korean cases as follows: "Regarding the Wanbao Mountain and Korean incidents, this Ministry has recently submitted serious protest letters and is handling them separately. The *chargé* has already been issued. There has been much criticism from the outside, such as asking why the Wanbao case could not have been prevented beforehand. Such criticisms are largely based on a misunderstanding of the truth. The investigation into the Wan case shows that it originated with Hao Yongde's land lease, which was originally a matter for local officials. According to the methods for farmers to lease farmland in the Eastern Provinces, farmers must submit a report to the provincial government for approval through local officials in order for the lease to take effect. In the Wanbao Mountain farmland lease to Hao, the local officials did not report to the provincial government, so the procedures were incomplete. Furthermore, before the provincial government approved it, Hao transferred the lease to Koreans, making the procedures even more incomplete. This was originally a matter of nationality, but later it involved diplomacy. Local governments handle a vast array of daily affairs, and even if all the employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were dispersed everywhere, it would be difficult to know everything in detail. Before such matters occur, no one can predict them. As for the Korean incident, leaflets were discovered beforehand. Upon hearing the news, consular officials went to the Korean officials and urged them to pay attention. This was because they were mindful of the tragedy that had occurred five years ago, so they had to pay attention in advance. However, the Japanese officials in Korea turned a deaf ear and paid no attention. After the incident occurred, the various consulates concentrated the overseas Chinese and made every effort to protect and rescue them, having done their duty to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>The questions from the citizens have their reasons. The consulate did not know beforehand and had no way to take measures. Knowing and calling the Korean officials to pay attention, and providing rescue afterward, is called fulfilling one's responsibility. It is natural for the people of the country to be stirred up by such actions. In a country with sufficient strength, it is not just a protest letter. After the Russo-Japanese War, Roosevelt served as the mediator and held a conference in Portsmouth. The Japanese side believed that it had suffered a great loss of life and property in the war with Russia and demanded compensation. The Russian side refused. Finally, the Russian representative hinted to his accompanying secretary to indicate, at the time of the breakdown, that he would go out on a pretext to send a telegram to his country, ordering the resumption of the war. This was learned by the Japanese. Representative Komura knew that the resumption of the war would be detrimental to him, so he swallowed his anger and withdrew the original proposal. As soon as this news came out, the Japanese citizens were agitated and extremely serious. Fortunately, the elders of the Japanese government were able to deeply understand the overall situation, and the heads of state also knew that they could not fight Russia again, so they were able to understand Komura. In recent years, the National Government's foreign policy has been aggressive and has been somewhat effective. At this time of internal worries, would you think it is better to disregard the consequences and take a desperate gamble with others, or to think about remedying and studying its fundamental problems? The current situation in the Eastern Provinces is extremely dangerous. If it is not handled properly, there are hidden dangers. Vice-Commander Zhang, who grew up in the Eastern Provinces, pays special attention to the above two matters. Chairman Jiang and the various committees of the central government are also extremely concerned. We should now study and find ways to make the dangerous areas of the Eastern Provinces peaceful, and to make the dangerous areas of China peaceful. Chairman Jiang is braving the summer heat to go to the front line, because the bandits will be easily resolved once they are wiped out, and foreign troubles can also be gradually eliminated. However, there are people who, at a time when the bandits have not been eliminated and the overseas Chinese in Korea have died, do not hesitate to flatter foreigners and beg for neighbors, using foreign forces to undermine domestic unity, which is truly incomprehensible. I took up the post of diplomacy when in a time of crisis, and have experienced many hardships in the past three years. Thinking from a personal point of view, I am not unable to retire immediately, but thinking from the national point of view, it cannot be taken as a child's play. Coming and going must be honest and upright, and one must do one's best to handle matters. If there are other good methods or capable people, then I am willing to humbly accept instruction. We should seek the interests of the country and not pursue our own selfish gains. All of my compatriots should understand this." (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Rongbao Arrives in Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reports on the Results of the Investigation in Korea</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Rongbao arrived in Beiping this afternoon and told reporters that after the tragic anti-Chinese incident in Korea, he was instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to go to Pyongyang, Incheon, Seoul, and other places to investigate. The results showed that the anti-Chinese riots occurred simultaneously throughout Korea. The losses were most severe in Pyongyang, where over 150 of our overseas Chinese compatriots were killed and material losses exceeded 2 million Japanese yen. Private hospitals throughout Korea housed over a thousand refugees. Pyongyang and other places were under the power of the Japanese, and the Japanese side cannot evade responsibility for failing to prevent the incident beforehand and failing to protect afterward. It is said that the Japanese claim that they buried over a hundred compatriots, and this is true. This mission has three key points for negotiations on the Korean case: (1) Post-incident guarantees; (2) Formal apology from the Japanese side; (3) Compensation for losses. He will go to Beijing in four or five days to report the truth to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and request instructions on how to proceed. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Rongbao passed through Tianjin at 7 a.m. on the 27th on his way to Beiping. Reporters visited him at the station. In addition to Wang's statement to the press in Shenyang, the reporter asked four questions, to which Wang replied: (1) "Look at who is in power in Korea now. The truth of this riot cannot escape the eyes and ears of the world. The facts are there, so there is no need to collect more evidence as a basis for negotiation." (2) "Over a hundred overseas Chinese were killed, two hundred were injured, and the total losses were estimated at 2.4 million Japanese yen." (3) "The dead have not yet been buried, and the injured have been sent to hospitals throughout the region for treatment. Refugees are being provided with food by consulates throughout the region." (4) "The conditions for negotiation with Japan are: A. Japan guarantees that Korean citizens will not engage in anti-Chinese riots again; B. Compensation for losses; C. Apology to the Chinese government." Wang also said that he would report everything to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after two or three days of rest in Beiping. He believes that this matter cannot be resolved in the Northeast region and must be negotiated in Beijing. (27th Dispatch)</p>

On the 26th, 500 overseas Chinese from Wonsan passed through Seoul on their way back to China. On the 24th, the reporter went to Pyongyang to investigate. Injured overseas Chinese at the hospital included 41 men and 4 women, with 6 seriously injured, all housed in lower-class wards. A woman named Zhu Xing, whose husband and son were both killed, leaving only her and a three-year-old child, were both injured. She burst into tears when speaking. Over 300 Chinese merchants in Pyongyang have no hope of resuming business. Of the 8,000 overseas Chinese, only 500 remain, living in four locations, afraid to go out. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chen and Liu's Mission to Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Various Chinese and foreign newspapers have recorded many different versions of Chen Youren and Liu Jiwen's trip to Japan. Yesterday, I met a certain foreigner who said that the rumors that Chen and others were carrying certain conditions to Japan were not so simple in fact. However, it would not be believable to say that Chen and others' trip to Japan had no political relationship. It is said that the motive for this matter was at the end of June. At that time, the old and new factions in Guangzhou were not very united, and they were also worried about the lack of diplomatic support, making it difficult to achieve anything. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily use any means to first take advantage of a certain country in order to obtain diplomatic and military convenience. After the position was consolidated, the policy would be changed. On the other hand, a certain country, based on its traditional policy of not wanting China to be united, was happy to accept this. At that time, the Korean Incident had not yet occurred, and signals had already been sent to important figures of a certain country stationed in Guangdong. That country gladly agreed and promised to provide informal hospitality. After the Korean Incident occurred, this previously agreed plan could not be withdrawn. Therefore, Chen and Liu visited Japan as originally planned, but at this time, it was just an exchange of opinions. The truth is like this. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Liu Dajun Discusses Silver Prices</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Recent foreign news reported that the Mexican government had decided to adopt a silver standard, and that Germany was also preparing to mint a large quantity of silver auxiliary coins. According to the opinion of statistics expert Liu Dajun, Mexico is a silver-producing country and also a colony of the United States. If it adopts a silver standard, it will be very unfavorable to the United States. Whether the United States will recognize it is a question. Even if it is possible, it will only increase the use of silver to some extent. Its impact on China's economy will only be to slightly stabilize the silver market. The reason for the cheapness of silver in the world is actually due to the rise in prices and the lack of gold production. The main gold-producing area in the world is South Africa. According to experts, South African gold mines are nearing exhaustion. The issue of gold use in the future is a very big problem. As for China, it is currently necessary to first seek the stability of silver prices and prevent gold prices from continuing to rise. In order to conform to the world trend, it is necessary to adopt the gold standard. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Negotiations Between Britain, the United States, and Germany</h3>
<p>Related to Financial Issues</p>
<p>MacDonald Changes to Train to Go to Berlin</p>
<p>Stimson Leaves Germany for Britain</p>
<p>Increasing Trust in the Germans</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 26th—British Prime Minister MacDonald departs for Berlin by train tonight because the weather is not favorable for aviation. Foreign Secretary Henderson and officials from the ministry departed this morning. The German Prime Minister and Foreign Minister previously visited London and stayed briefly at the British Prime Minister's villa. The British Prime Minister and others are now visiting the German capital in return.</p>
<p>▲National, Berlin, 27th—British Foreign Secretary Henderson arrived here at 8:30 this morning. After getting off the train, he told reporters of his joy in visiting, saying that visiting Germany at this difficult time for Germany is deeply symbolic of the friendship between the two countries. He then drove to the specially prepared Grand Emperor Hotel. British Prime Minister MacDonald will also stay there after arriving in Berlin tonight. Afterward, US Secretary of State Stimson, after meeting with the German President, immediately drove to visit Henderson. Afterward, he boarded a train for London at 1:00 PM. Before leaving, Stimson spoke to reporters, praising the German Prime Minister Brüning and his cabinet members for their courage and determination, and expressing great admiration. He also said that before coming to Berlin, he had great trust in the ability of the German people to extricate themselves from their financial difficulties. The US government and people also share this trust. What he has seen and heard since coming to Berlin is sufficient to prove this trust.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 26th—After consulting with representatives from the German government and national banks, major German banks decided to establish an "Acceptance and Guarantee Bank" with a capital of 200,000,000 marks. The main purpose is to restore the unobstructed flow of national currency and to support the resumption of business of the closed National Bank. Everyone expressed satisfaction, as this proposal proves Germany's sincerity in striving to restore world credit. Therefore, the National Bank can relax its current restrictive methods that prevent industry and commerce from operating. German Prime Minister Brüning and US Secretary of State Stimson had an informal and confidential discussion over lunch in Potsdam, discussing this and other matters. The diplomatic community attaches great importance to this discussion.</p>
<p>▲National, Berlin, 26th—Swedish banker Wallenberg and American advisor Spag to the Bank of England arrived in Berlin today to discuss with the German government how to implement the resolutions of the seven-nation conference in London. It is expected that bankers from various countries will arrive in Germany one after another, and the discussion period may take a month. According to reports, Wallenberg and Spag expressed admiration for the German bankers' joint creation of an acceptance and mortgage guarantee bank. The establishment of this type of bank has also won praise in domestic public opinion.</p>
<h3>Strange Flyers Spread in Germany's Northern Industrial Area</h3>
<p>Predicting a Great Revolution in Germany</p>
<p>The World Will Be Reddened</p>
<p>The Fall of Capitalism</p>
<p>Presumed to Be the Work of Radicals</p>
<p>▲National, Berlin, 26th—A peculiar flyer was found in Germany's northern industrial area today, predicting that a great revolution would occur in Germany on August 1st, the day the European war began. This flyer was mimeographed, and it is unknown where it came from. After the police discovered it, it was impossible to track down the mastermind. Although it is regarded by the political circles as a kind of nonsense used to incite the people, the newspapers say that this matter cannot be taken as merely accidental. Because Novotny, the signer of the flyer, described the events after the revolution in great detail and in accordance with Marxism, it is probably the instigation of radicals to disturb the people, so it cannot be taken lightly. According to the flyer's predictions, the vanguard of national socialism will occupy Wilhelm Street on August 1st. At the same time, members of parliament will gather in the Reichstag to declare the establishment of the Third Reich. But this dictatorial government will only last for three days. On August 5th, the Red Army from the Ruhr area will attack the capital, defeat Hitler's army, and Russian cavalry will invade Poland at the same time. The Polish army will inevitably disintegrate. Then the Soviet governments of Russia, Poland, and Germany will form an alliance, gathering the natural resources of the three countries to resist capitalist countries. It is expected that within 48 hours, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and the Balkan countries will join this alliance, and dictatorship in Italy will be overthrown within a day or two. Communism will soon invade France, then England from France, and capitalist governments will be overthrown one by one. Even Fiji will be governed by the Zulu and Arab people. After the Soviet government of England abandons its suzerainty over India, India will eliminate princes and become independent. Novotny's predictions for China say that Siam and Vietnam will inevitably return to China in the future, and the abolition of China's existing consular jurisdiction and concessions will not require any effort.</p>
<h3>Chilean President Resigns</h3>
<p>Four Years of Autocracy, Public Resentment Boils Over</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Chilean Capital, 26th—Chilean President Ibáñez resigned today to avoid bloodshed, ending four years of autocracy. Three cabinet members have resigned this month due to popular discontent. Today, the President convened a meeting of important figures and declared his resignation on the spot.</p>
<h3>Indian Authorities Coerce the Collection of Land Taxes</h3>
<p>Gandhi Sends Letter of Warning</p>
<p>Court Magistrate Assassinated</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Surat, 26th—Gandhi sent a letter to the land tax collection bureau in the form of a pathetic ultimatum, accusing them of coercing the collection of taxes, and telegraphed the main points of the letter to the Indian Governor-General. It is reported that the Indian Governor-General has asked Gandhi not to incite unrest.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Calcutta, 27th—Garlick, the upper-level magistrate of Alipore District in Calcutta, was shot and killed in court today. The assassin was also shot and killed by the police.</p>
<h3>Royal Austro-Hungarian Marriage</h3>
<p>Contains Political Motives</p>
<p>▲ Nanjing Dispatch, 26th: Princess Ileana of Romania, the youngest sister of the King of Romania, was married here today to Archduke Anton of the House of Habsburg. They plan to reside in Vienna after the marriage. According to official reports, the marriage is purely out of love, but observers of the political situation mostly believe it contains political motives. The current King of Romania often expresses sympathy for Hungary. If the Habsburg monarchy in Hungary is restored in the future after this marriage, the two countries will become closely linked. Therefore, it is believed that the King of Romania may intend to break away from the Little Entente and form a political and commercial alliance with Hungary. Now that Germany and Austria have a customs union plan, if Romania and Hungary combine and become close to Germany, the remaining two countries of the Little Entente (Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia) will also be forced to take the same path. If such a situation of Central European consolidation is achieved, France will be isolated. Looking around Europe, only Poland can be considered a strong ally. This is related to the rise and fall of German and French power, and today's marriage of the Romanian princess may be the first cornerstone in building this edifice. It is also possible. (Translator's note: Romania and Hungary are agricultural countries, suffering from a lack of sales channels for agricultural products. Germany is an industrial country, while France is a semi-agricultural and semi-industrial country. Therefore, after the implementation of the German-Austrian customs union, it is likely to extend to Hungary and Romania.)</p>
<h3>Chen Youren's Mission to Japan</h3>
<p>Received with Gentlemanly Courtesy</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry Issues Statement</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, 27th: It is rumored that Chen Youren's purpose in going to Japan is to hire six Japanese officers below the rank of colonel as military advisors.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, 27th: Chen Youren entered Tokyo on the 26th. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 26th, stating that "Signs of political turmoil in China are emerging again. Therefore, it is not surprising that many famous Chinese come to Japan. If these Chinese who come to Japan do not engage in political activities in their own country, it is only natural that Japan treats them with due respect. Even if Mr. Chen Youren's arrival in Tokyo is a fact, although it is not at the instigation of the Japanese government and is not based on the intentions of the Japanese government, it is still natural to treat him as a foreign gentleman with due courtesy. The Japanese government's attitude towards the internal chaos in China has been repeatedly stated and remains unchanged."</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo Dispatch from Reuters, 27th: It is heard that the military authorities have received a telegram from Guangzhou, intending to hire seven junior officers as military advisors and several senior craftsmen from arsenals. They have also requested the supply of military equipment and ammunition. It is heard that the military authorities seem likely to reject this request, fearing it will cause disputes with the Nanjing government, as the Nanjing government has already been officially recognized as the sole government of China. Chen Youren will return here tonight. It is heard that he will visit Foreign Minister Baron Kijūrō Shidehara and other officials. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to treat him as an ordinary foreign traveler.</p>
<h3>Dark Photographs of American Prisons</h3>
<p>▲ Washington Dispatch from Reuters, 27th: The report of the U.S. Prison Investigation Committee states that most prisons, despite implementing unbelievably harsh punishments, ultimately fail to achieve rehabilitation. In the future, a new organizational law should be used, education should be vigorously implemented, and prison officials should be people capable of managing schools. The report mentions the tragic conditions in prisons, stating that juvenile offenders are often subjected to severe beatings, almost to the point of death, and are not only shackled but also immersed in cold water, sometimes deprived of food and drink. The prison hospitals are often full of patients, and the only one that is managed reasonably well is the Idaho Industrial Training School. It also states that juvenile offenders should not be treated the same as adult felons.</p>
<h3>Nagata Comet Approaching Earth</h3>
<p>Visible in a Few Months</p>
<p>▲ California Dispatch from Dentsu News Agency, 26th: The Wilson Observatory announced today that the comet discovered by Nagata, a Japanese American, will gradually approach Earth in a few months and will be visible to the naked eye. However, the exact date has not yet been calculated. Nagata, who discovered the comet, is a poor artist residing in Bulura, California. He observed the sky several weeks ago and unexpectedly discovered a new comet in the Leo constellation. He reported it to the Wilson Observatory, which confirmed it and named it the Nagata Comet.</p>
<h3>Dutch Doctor Discovers New Cancer Diagnosis</h3>
<p>Good News for the Medical Community</p>
<p>▲ London Dispatch from Reuters, 26th: Bensegn, a previously little-known Dutch doctor, has been engaged in research work for many years and is now a world-class cancer expert. Dr. Bensegn claims that he can diagnose cancer using blood tests. A representative of the British Empire Cancer Research Association, Kenginenai, personally went to Zist to investigate his experiments and has just returned to London. According to him,</p>
<p>This is the greatest advancement in understanding cancer in fifty years. Dr. Bensegn's diagnostic method is now immediately being used in the London Cancer Hospital. According to opinions in the British medical community, Dr. Bensegn's new invention, although not a new treatment method, is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<h3>Telegram from Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>Respectfully to all newspaper offices: Recently, a telegram was sent to the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, forwarded to the generals and soldiers at the front lines fighting against the Communists. The telegram reads: "Heaven has brought disaster to the Yellow race, and the poison of the Red flames flows. Across the territories of the four remaining provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangdong, the Communists are digging their graves and burying everything. Millions of compatriots are drowning together. Communist forces are everywhere, and houses are in ruins. The red flag flies, and the people suffer. Compared to Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, the killings are even more numerous. Compared to Zhu Ci and Huang Chao, the brutality is even worse. If they are not eradicated in time, our sacred Chinese nation of five thousand years will be completely plunged into a place of fire and water, and ten thousand eons of no recovery. The central government embraces the wish of compassion for all and is deeply concerned about the dangers of weapons and death. Therefore, we raise a righteous army and launch a large-scale campaign of suppression. Our commander-in-chief braves the summer heat and marches quickly, concerned for the country. Our generals and soldiers are generous and determined to fulfill their missions and vow to establish merit. Wherever we go, we should be invincible, like pulling down dry leaves. Our prestige should spread far and wide, and the people should be freed from their suffering. Victory reports should be frequent, and both heaven and man should admire us. We humbly request that you carry forward the spirit of great fearlessness, continue your efforts, establish a unified foundation as solid as a rock, thoroughly implement our policies, eliminate all traces of the bandits, alleviate the suffering of our people, and not only comfort the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in heaven but also comfort the hopes of people all over the world. The South is looking up, and the North is leaning in. We respectfully present our humble regards and eagerly anticipate your response, hoping that you will send a telegram of encouragement to inspire us. We are filled with anticipation. Sincerely, Liu Yifei, Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government; Committee Members Jian Yong, Wen Guang, Gao Xibing, Zhao Xingde, Hang Jinshou, and Demuchukezhenglupu, together kowtowing in Qinyuan."</p>

A staggering 521,929 Koreans had penetrated deep into the northeastern hinterland, coexisting with our people. These Koreans who had penetrated deep into our country's hinterland almost exclusively engaged in the cultivation of paddy and dryland rice fields. Moreover, their distribution areas were all fertile land with convenient water sources and good soil. These uninvited guests who came in groups were no less than formidable enemies who were seizing the means of survival of the people of our Northeast. Such a serious problem, if not noticed and resolved early, is either a sign of blindness or foolishness.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Boling speaks about pacifying internal affairs to resist foreign aggression and the situation in Yunnan</p>
<p>▲ Cai Yuanpei reports on three matters: suppression of the Communists, Shi You-san's rebellion, and the flood disaster</p>
<p>▲ Central Party Headquarters: The Central Party Headquarters held its 122nd Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 27th. Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Ding Weifen, Yu Jingtang, Wang Boling, Miao Peicheng, Fang Juehui, and over 600 staff and guests attended. Ding Weifen presided over the meeting. After the rituals, Wang Boling reported, stating that the current internal rebellion, foreign aggression, and Communist disaster are all resonating. Although the surface appears serious, pacifying internal affairs can resist foreign aggression. If internal rebellions do not occur, foreign aggression will not come. Shi You-san's rebellion was definitely colluding with Japanese imperialists behind the scenes, who were assisting with money. Moreover, if he managed to reach Pingjin, they even planned to assist with weapons and ammunition. The Guangdong faction also sent Chen Youren and Liu Jiwen to Japan to negotiate treasonous treaties and offer various benefits to the Japanese in order to plot rebellion. At this time, the Wanpaoshan Incident occurred, so foreign aggression was entirely caused by internal rebellion. Now, we should first eliminate the Communist disaster and punish the rebels. The central government and the Northeast have dispatched large armies to encircle Shi's rebellion. It can be resolved within ten days. The Guangdong faction is entangled with party issues. The party's righteousness must be displayed. If there is righteousness, then no one will dare to rebel again. This time's Guangdong coup was first corrected by Yunnan's telegram, which is very important. I have been to Yunnan twice and would like to briefly report on the situation in Yunnan. To understand the situation of party affairs in Yunnan and the needs for future construction, it is necessary to be familiar with Yunnan's environment, as well as the political, economic, transportation, and various recent conditions. Yunnan belonged to Chinese territory as early as 3,000 years ago, but it has always been laissez-faire. It was not until Zhu Yuanzhang's brother, Duke Mu of the Ming Dynasty, arrived in Yunnan and felt that the population was too small that he decided to immigrate and populate the border. He moved three million people from Jiangnan to Yunnan, distributed throughout the province, to recuperate and multiply. Over the years, many indigenous people have also assimilated. Unfortunately, immigration is still too small, so there are still quite a few semi-civilized indigenous people. Geographically speaking, no one can know the exact area of Yunnan. The ground is mostly mountainous. Some journeys of thirty days still do not leave the county. The size of the area can be imagined. It borders Myanmar to the west. The demarcation of the border between Myanmar and Yunnan is still pending. Since the British built a railway to Jiangxinpo and Pianma, the area west of Gaoligong Mountain is no longer ours. The British have also built a highway thousands of miles long, directly reaching Tibet. The future of Tibet is also very dangerous. It borders Annam to the south. When the border was demarcated, due to the昏庸 [lit. muddle-headed] of the Manchu court, more than three thousand miles of land were abandoned. In the early Republic of China, the strict prohibition of opium led people to move the border at night, and a lot was lost again. In addition, it is bordered by Guangxi and Guizhou to the east and Sichuan to the north. There is a lot of miasma. Since the Xinhai Revolution, the people of Yunnan have been able to manage the affairs of Yunnan. Cai Songpo (Cai E) made many achievements in Yunnan. There has been no major progress since then. Initially, transportation from Hunan and Sichuan to Yunnan took two months. After the sea ban was lifted, it was possible to travel from Hong Kong to Haiphong by train in one and a half days, then to the border, and then by Yunnan train to Kunming. This is the throat of Yunnan's access to the outside world, entirely controlled by the French, who levy heavy taxes on all goods that pass through, viewing us with the eyes of colonizers, thus further reducing the production in the interior of Yunnan. Therefore, road construction is very necessary. Currently, Yunnan can build over a thousand miles of highway a year, but due to limited manpower and financial resources, it has not been able to actively proceed. When it comes to finance, there is the Fuye Bank, which specializes in domestic and foreign exchange. In addition, there is the French Banque de l'Indochine, which issues banknotes and absorbs cash, resulting in higher exchange rates. Regarding the climate, the provincial capital is neither cold nor hot, but there are extremely hot places on the border, and the northwest is extremely cold, with snow for half the year. The province's products include items from cold, hot, and temperate zones. Mineral resources are particularly rich. The people are simple, hardworking, and hard-working. In Yunnan's party affairs, there were many comrades in the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). Since Tang Jiyao sang the heresy of provincial autonomy, he broke away from our party. This was the situation from 1923 to 1925. After the Northern Expedition, there was the political change in 1927, and Tang Jiyao stepped down. At that time, the Guangdong Political Branch sent people to form the party, but unfortunately, they mistakenly sent communists. Suspicion and disputes arose, and Hu Ruoyu took the opportunity to instigate political turmoil. After the efforts of Comrade Long Yun to suppress the rebellion, it was finally pacified. As for today, party disputes have arisen again. Old comrades, CCP members, and those sent by the central government have each formed a provincial party headquarters, and there were three provincial party headquarters for a time. Later, the people from the central government and the old comrades combined to overthrow the communists, but then they split again. The central government decided to withdraw everyone and re-register. After my first inspection, I re-appointed guiding committee members and established the current provincial party headquarters. After a year of work, significant achievements have been made. Several communist organizations have been cracked down, so there is no possibility of the communists reviving in Yunnan. By the time of my second inspection of Yunnan, 14 lower-level party headquarters had been established. Over 200 mass organizations were also formed, and the atmosphere of opposing French imperialism was also quite激昂 [lit. impassioned]. Government officials have developed a great faith in the party, and the people's thoughts are leaning towards the Three Principles of the People. When the Guangdong coup occurred this time, Yunnan took the lead in advocating justice and refuted it. This is an important manifestation. If the whole country can be like this, then the country will be stable, and foreign aggressors will not be able to take advantage of the opportunity. Therefore, it is a profound truth to say that pacifying internal affairs can resist foreign aggression." The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>▲ National Government: The National Government held Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the same morning. Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Zhu Peide, Wang Boqun, Li Shuhua, Gao Weiyue, Ma Fuxiang, Ru Yuli, and over 200 other people attended. Yu Youren presided over the meeting. Cai</p>
<p>The most notable event for the people is naturally the Korean tragedy. I have already discussed my observations on this tragedy in the previous memorial week meeting held at the Central Party Headquarters, and all the newspapers have already published it, so everyone knows it, and I won't repeat it. Domestically, the most important thing is still the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi. The Red bandits are different from ordinary bandits; they have a well-defined and justified ideology, and they both threaten and entice the masses, seemingly possessing a kind of religious magic. Therefore, they should not be underestimated. They have secret organizations in various provinces, which are being cracked down on under the supervision of our party. In Jiangxi, they have already occupied territory and formed a Red Army, which is like adding wings to a tiger, creating endless troubles. According to the reports we have received, the Commander-in-Chief's prestige, the soldiers' bravery, and the rapid advance despite the summer heat have led to the recovery of all the important cities occupied by the Red bandits. Only their old nest of Donggu remains, and it will be captured soon. It will not be difficult to clip the tiger's wings. However, the Red bandits are like a plague wherever they go. Even if the plague is eliminated, its toxins remain, and a period of disinfection is necessary. This is the work of propaganda, which should thoroughly expose the bandits' fallacies so that the masses will not be fooled again. To truly awaken the masses, we must not only rely on theory but also give them practical strength. After eliminating the Red bandits from a certain place, if we do not make positive arrangements and simply return to the former state of corrupt officials or local tyrants and gentry, then it would be no different from attracting the Red bandits and inviting them to make a comeback. The reason why the Red bandits were able to invade these places in the past was because most people's lives were unstable, and they only saw a small number of people benefiting themselves at the expense of others and doing whatever they wanted, which created a feeling of injustice. Therefore, upon hearing theories such as class struggle, they felt that an opportunity to vent their anger had arrived and spontaneously followed. Now, we must correct this habit and give the masses a hope of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, as well as a way to achieve this hope. What is the method? The late Premier Sun Yat-sen's instructions on how to start implementing local autonomy have already enlightened us: (1) Clear household registration, (2) Establish agencies, (3) Determine land prices, (4) Repair roads, (5) Reclaim wasteland, (6) Run schools. The method of clearing household registration is to ensure that, in addition to a small number of people who exclusively enjoy rights, all others who do not fulfill their obligations cannot enjoy rights, so there will be no shortage of people willing to undertake the task of autonomy. Establishing agencies means that the Food Administration Bureau is the most important, and other agencies for the production and manufacturing of clothing, housing, and transportation needs should also be gradually established and managed to ensure that the people's livelihood needs are adjusted at any time to prevent shortages or imbalances. Determining land prices means that landowners should report their own prices, and the autonomous organizations should levy taxes based on the prices, and they can also buy land at the prices. The increase in land prices in the future will belong to the organization. In this way, landowners cannot sit back and enjoy unearned profits, and it will be easy to achieve the goal of land to the tiller in the future. Repairing roads means repairing them with the obligatory labor of the residents. With convenient transportation, civilization will also advance. Reclaiming wasteland should be divided into two types: public management and private cultivation. The construction work for the publicly managed land should also be done with obligatory labor. When the wasteland is reclaimed, the public and private income will be abundant. Running schools means giving all local children and adults the opportunity to receive free education, and the school's expenses should also be supplied with obligatory labor. These are all things that all localities in the country should do first, but no locality has done them yet, which is a real proof of the government's dereliction of duty. We who serve in the government should all take the blame. To make up for our mistakes, we should start by doing this in the newly recovered areas of Jiangxi because after these areas were occupied by the communists, the population fled, the land deeds were burned, and the agencies were destroyed, so they need to be reorganized from scratch. Cursory settlement and thorough reorganization require the same procedures, so why not use the thorough method? This time, the Commander-in-Chief personally led the expedition, not only with brave soldiers but also with many loyal comrades as members of the Jiangxi Party Affairs and Political Affairs Committee. I believe that all comrades will follow the Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings and plan to start implementing local autonomy, and those of us who remain in the rear should also pay attention to how to gradually implement autonomy in all localities. If we can do this, the elimination of the communists will be thorough, and there will be no more battles like Jiangxi in the future. As for the two more important events recently, one is Shi You-san's rebellion. Shi You-san is fickle. This time, he took advantage of the fact that the Red bandits had not yet been eliminated and the Korean tragedy had occurred to raise troops and provoke conflict, which is hated by the people of the country. The government has already issued a clear order to suppress him, and it will be resolved soon. The other is the heavy rain causing disaster. Recently, Guangdong, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, and northern Jiangsu have been hit by floods, and even near the capital, there is a fear of a poor autumn harvest. This is due to the lack of forests and the disrepair of water conservancy, and fundamental relief measures must be planned, but temporary measures cannot be ignored. The government has ordered the disaster-stricken provinces to prepare for famine relief in advance to prevent problems before they occur. Funds have also been allocated to provide relief to the current disaster victims, which should alleviate the difficulties. The meeting adjourned after the speech.</p>
<h3>Military Councilors and Advisors Take Office</h3>
<p>▲ Gao Wei-yue and Seventeen Others</p>
<p>▲ Cai Yuan-pei and Yu You-ren Both Delivered Addresses</p>
<p>The swearing-in ceremony for General Councilor Gao Wei-yue, Lieutenant General Councilors Cao Wan-shun and Wang Han-ming, Major General Councilors Yi De-qin, Feng Hua-tang, Ma Ji-di, Zhu Gao-ru, Li Yi-zi, Colonel Advisors Liu Hai-shan, Wang Zhen-bang, Liu Zan-tong, Wu Wen-fu, Wang Tai-qi, Ma Fang-zheng, Lin Zhuo, Major General Director Yang Pei-zhang, Colonel Section Chief Tang Wen-huan, and others of the Military Council of the National Government was held at 10:30 AM on the 27th in the Grand Hall of the National Government. Chairman Yu You-ren led the ceremony. Gao Wei-yue and others raised their right hands to take the oath. Central Committee Member Cai Yuan-pei was the supervisor. After the oath, Committee Member Cai delivered an address, stating that it was a matter of congratulations for everyone to assume their respective positions as military councilors and advisors. Although the country is now transitioning from the period of military administration to the period of political tutelage, domestic military affairs are not yet completely resolved, and national defense is of utmost importance. Therefore, the reorganization of the army's establishment and the strengthening of self-defense capabilities are matters of urgent importance. Everyone has rich military experience and will surely be able to conduct separate research and make great contributions. Yu You-ren's address briefly stated that everyone has extremely rich knowledge and experience in military affairs. After taking office, they will surely strive forward to live up to the expectations of the central government. Sun Yat-sen said that the foundation of the revolution lies in profound knowledge, especially for revolutionary soldiers, who must possess profound knowledge. They must sacrifice and fight for the cause on the front lines and conduct research based on their knowledge in the rear. Only in this way can true success be achieved. Since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been numerous wars. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, several wars have also occurred. The biggest cause of these wars lies in the lack of understanding of the cause by reactionary soldiers. Everyone has a considerable history in the party and will surely be able to work diligently in their respective positions with their indomitable spirit, setting an example for soldiers across the country. Finally, Gao Wei-yue replied, stating that the Military Council holds an important position. Regarding the issues of resisting foreign aggression, consolidating national defense, planning for overall security, and ensuring the livelihood of the people, thorough plans and preparations must be made to cope with them adequately. Wei-yue and others are limited in talent and knowledge, and they are deeply afraid of not being able to live up to this important responsibility. They hope that the Central National Government Committee members will provide guidance from time to time to correct their shortcomings. After the reply, the ceremony concluded with music.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Bank Exchange Coupon Issuance Tax</h3>

<h3>Minister Wang's Inspection of Pyongyang</h3>
<p>▲ The Situation in the Korean Territory Has Not Fully Returned to Normal</p>
<p>An Dong dispatch: According to a visitor returning from Pyongyang, Korea, Minister Wang Rong-bao, the ambassador to Japan, accompanied by Consul Ren Jia-feng stationed in Kobe, arrived in Gyeongseong (Seoul), Korea, for inspection. After the inspection concluded, he took a route westward to inspect. He originally planned to arrive in Pyongyang by train on the evening of the 16th, but it was temporarily postponed for one night. He arrived at Pyongyang Station at 7:17 AM on the 17th. Minister Wang was accompanied by five people, including Consul General Zhang Wei-cheng of Gyeongseong and Consul Ren Jia-feng of Kobe. Members of the Pyongyang Consulate and Meng Xian-shi, Chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, stood on the platform to welcome him. After Wang got off the train, he greeted the welcomers and then took automobiles to the Pyongyang Hotel. After a light refreshment and a short rest, he took an automobile to the refugee camp. After inspecting for a week, he gave a speech to comfort the refugees. At this time, the refugees cried bitterly, and their voices shook the roof. They all demanded a solution for relief. Wang left the refugee camp and went to the public cemetery. All that could be seen were mounds of yellow earth, and the graves were piled upon each other. According to Chinese compatriots who witnessed it, more than 400 Chinese compatriots were killed in this incident. During the riots on the 4th and 5th, Chinese corpses were everywhere along the streets. The Japanese police dug more than 90 pits in the public cemetery outside the city, and each pit buried four or five corpses. The exact number of wounded and dead is unknown. The Japanese are trying to cover up, saying that there is no such number. Minister Wang will report the actual situation of the investigation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at any time. He stayed overnight at the Pyongyang Hotel, and the Japanese side sent police to protect him. On the morning of the 18th, he took a train from Pyongyang to Incheon. In the afternoon of the same day, at 2:00 PM, he returned to Pyongyang. At 5:00 PM on the 19th, he boarded the train eastward to Gyeongseong. He is scheduled to go to Sinuiju on the 22nd for an on-site inspection, and then cross the Yalu River westward and take the Anfeng Line to return home.</p>
<p>On the way to the country, there are more than 700 or 800 unemployed Chinese in Pyongyang, with their livelihoods cut off. They are now being sent back to their country by the Pyongyang Chinese Chamber of Commerce to seek other livelihoods.</p>
<p>Another report: At 10:00 AM on the 20th, more than 60 Korean rioters suddenly appeared in Sinuiju, across the river from this city, each holding stones, intending to riot again. They threw several stones at the gate of the Xin'yan Iron Factory and completely smashed the glass windows of Fu Fengtai, and then fled. At 2:00 PM on the 21st, the Japanese authorities in Sinuiju specially summoned representatives from all sectors of Chinese and Japanese merchants to hold a plenary meeting to discuss future protection methods. It can be seen that the situation in various parts of the Korean territory has not completely returned to a state of peace. (21st)</p>
<h3>The Severity of the Flood in the Capital</h3>
<p>▲ The Water Reaches Chest Level in the Area of the Central Party Headquarters on Huangpu Road</p>
<p>▲ Various Agencies Have Already Discussed Emergency Relief and Rescue Measures</p>
<p>▲ The Flood is Due to Continuous Rain and Flash Floods from the Upper Reaches</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The continuous rain has caused the water level in the north and south of the city and in Xiaguan to rise day by day. The crucial road surfaces in Xiaguan have been completely washed away. The water is knee-deep from Zhongshan Wharf to Yijiang Gate. In the area of the Three Archway Huangpu Road of the Central Party Headquarters, the water has reached chest level. On both sides of the Qinhuai River in the south of the city, in places like Dashiba Street and Confucius Temple, the water has already entered the houses. Although it cleared up on the 25th, the floodwater has not receded at all. This is because the river water and the river water are at the same level. It is not easy to leave unless the river tide ebbs. Therefore, the 10,000+ population in more than 4,100 households in the area from outside the Hailin Gate in Xiaguan to the Commercial Bureau Street still moved the submerged furniture and utensils to the side of the Commercial Bureau Street in the morning of the 26th. They were exposed to the sky, the smoke and fire were interrupted, the weak were crying with hunger, and the old and strong were sobbing. The situation was extremely miserable. Therefore, the National Government, the Municipal Government, and the Police Department are paying close attention to this and have convened meetings to discuss relief plans. The findings of the investigation are briefly described below.</p>
<p>▲ Forming an Emergency Relief Association The Executive Yuan recently received an order from the National Government to allocate three yuan to relieve the flood in the capital. It ordered the Ministry of Interior to convene relevant agencies in the capital to properly handle relief matters. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Interior notified the agencies on the morning of the 25th and held a meeting at the Ministry of Interior at 3:00 PM that afternoon. The representatives attending were Li Fan-guo and Chen Rui from the Executive Yuan, Zhang Wo-hua, Wang Ting-feng-yang, Chen Feng-zhang, Zhu Jiu-ying, and Zhang Fu-bao from the Ministry of Interior, Zhang Fu-heng and Wang Fu-heng from the Beijing Municipal Government, Hong from the Relief Committee, Xie Guan-yi from the Capital Police Department, and Li Jie-cai from the Municipal Social Bureau. Zhang Wo-hua was elected as the chairman. The following resolutions were made: (1) To organize the Capital Flood Emergency Relief Committee, divided into four groups: General Affairs, Relief, Investigation, and Fundraising. Zhang Wo-hua was elected as the chairman and Chen Rui as the vice chairman, and seventeen people were elected as members. (2) To nominate Wang Ting-yang to draft the regulations of the association. (3) To set the time to gather at the Ministry of Interior at 8:00 AM on the 26th to go to the following areas to investigate the flood: Xiaguan: Chen Rui, Chen Feng-zhang; Pukou: Li Jie-cai, Xie Guan-yi; Tongji Gate, Qinhuai River area: Wang Ting-yang, Hong ; Shuixi Gate: Zhu Jiu-ying, Zhang . Also, at 1:00 PM on the 26th, the second meeting was held at the Ministry of Interior. First, the regulations of the Emergency Relief Association were discussed. After being revised and passed item by item, the chairman announced the official establishment of the Flood Emergency Relief Association, which was scheduled to officially start work immediately. Then, the discussion focused on investigating the disaster situation in various places, and obtaining funds from the Ministry of Finance for relief, etc. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Meeting At 1:00 PM on the 25th, Mayor Wei Dao-ming, Secretary-General Ma Shou-hua, Director of the Social Bureau Li Jie-cai, Director of the Public Works Bureau Ma Yi-qun, Director of the Health Bureau Mei Yi-lin, and others held a temporary emergency meeting at the Municipal Government to decide on three measures to address the flood relief issue: (1) Prevention and dredging: The Public Works Bureau will send workers to block the river water and lake water to prevent flooding. At the same time, they will try to drain the water from various places in the city and select high places inside and outside the city to build thatched sheds to accommodate the victims to avoid displacement. (2) Relief: The Social Bureau will convene various groups to find ways to relieve the victims to save the lives of all people. (3) Rescue: The Health Bureau will send personnel to diagnose and treat diseases for the victims and inject preventive vaccines to prevent epidemics after the disaster.</p>
<p>▲ Causes of the Flood Ma Yi-qun, Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Works Bureau, issued a statement on the flood on the 25th. According to him, "I (Ma said himself) led the engineering team to inspect the flood situation in various parts of the city at dawn this morning and gave instructions on rescue methods. The cause of this flood is due to the continuous cloudy rain and the flash floods from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The water level of the Yangtze River has been one or two feet higher than the land. Therefore, it is increasingly out of control. Now, in addition to trying to block the water, dredging and guiding have become ineffective. Fortunately, the weather has cleared today. If there is no more rain in the area along the Yangtze River within three to five days, the water level of the Yangtze River will drop, and the floodwater in the city will be easily drained. Now the sandbags placed on the river bank in Xiaguan have also been completely submerged by the rising river water, and the flooded shanties have nowhere to go. This bureau has built dozens of large thatched sheds on the open space of Longchi Nunnery to accommodate the victims and will continue to select land inside and outside the city to build sheds to avoid displacement. The previously dug open ditches near Sajiawan in the north of the city are still beneficial for drainage and should not be a problem. The New Vegetable Market and its surroundings have always used Xiliuwan as the main channel for water discharge. However, the mountain water is coming too quickly, and the old river channels from Xiliuwan to Xiqiao, Taiping Bridge, and Jinchuan Gate are narrow and winding, which slows down the water discharge. Now we are trying to make it flow smoothly and guide it into the low-lying open space for storage. The water is five or six feet deep in the Huangpu Road area, and traffic is completely cut off. This is due to the intrusion of lake water. We are now planning to block it to prevent it from continuing to rise and send a large number of engineering teams to use machines to pump water and maintain traffic. As for the south of the city, on both sides of the Qinhuai River, thousands of sandbags had already been placed the night before, but due to the heavy rain and the backflow of the river water, the river water overturned the sandbags in an instant and flowed into the houses on both sides, making the previous defense work equal to zero. Today the weather is clear, and the water has gradually flowed out from Xiguan. The riverbed may be exposed within a day or two. We are now continuing to fill the important riverbanks with sandbags to prevent flooding."</p>
<h3>The Jinghu Railway After the Heavy Rain</h3>
<p>▲ The Earth Wall of Yangpeng Mountain Collapsed</p>
<p>▲ The Entrance of the Tunnel is Filled with Yellow Mud</p>
<p>▲ Consequently, Traffic is Blocked</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway's afternoon express train passed Zhenjiang at 3 PM the day before yesterday, but the water was deep at the entrance of the tunnel. Unexpectedly, heavy rain poured down from 4 to 5 PM. The special express train departing from Nanjing was washed away by the water below Yaohuamen first, and then submerged. The gravel under the sleepers was empty, and there was a fear of a train sinking. At the same time, the slopes on both sides of the Zhenjiang tunnel, about tens of feet high, were all yellow earth without stone masonry. The rainwater was powerful and pressed the earth down, and the floating earth piled up on the rails to more than ten feet. The water between the slopes was six or seven feet deep. Traffic was immediately cut off. The special express train then turned back to Nanjing. The trains from Shanghai to Zhenjiang could have dropped off passengers under the Heiqiao near the tunnel, but unexpectedly at about 8 PM, the wall of Yangpeng Mountain, less than half a mile from the tunnel, about ten feet high, collapsed onto the track with a loud bang. The soil piled up to a height of thirty feet, covering an area of about several acres. Three power poles were also broken. Therefore, the northbound train could only stop at the Nanmen Station. The train from Wuxi to Zhenjiang on the 25th ran as usual and returned to Nanmen. The station has no two-way tracks and no road sign to the station. After the passengers got on and off, it only drove in reverse. After reaching Zazhe, the train head could be transferred to the front of the train, but it was still the coal car in front and the chimney in the back, still driving in reverse. As for Nanmen Station, there has always been a small road leading to Nanmen. From Zhongzheng Road directly to the station, there is an 18-meter-wide avenue that can allow cars to pass smoothly. Therefore, although the trains could not reach the main station yesterday, the traffic was not difficult. As for the area between Nanjing and Zhenjiang, because the flood at Yaohuamen has not receded and the water is several feet deep at the Qiaotou Station, the trains dare not run. Northbound train tickets are sold to Zhenjiang. Those who want to go to Nanjing must either take a small wheel or a large upstream wheel. Those who want to go to Jiangbei can only hire sailboats because the cars are not running. Most of the travelers going west and north are temporarily staying in Zhenjiang inns. According to a reporter's investigation, the soil in the tunnel and Yangpeng Mountain can be removed and repaired tonight. The Nanjing-Zhenjiang section can be opened to traffic this afternoon, and the entire line can be restored to its original condition at the latest tomorrow. The Zhenjiang tunnel has not been repaired for many years. The left and right slopes on both sides of the tunnel entrance should be entirely built with stone blocks, and cement should be added to the slope walls.</p>
<p>Clear outlet ditches, so that mountain water has a way out and has the power to resist soil swelling. If this can be done, even if there is heavy rain, the soil will not collapse and fill the track, cutting off traffic. The road should quickly seek remedial measures. (26th)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Suffers Major Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>▲ The Entire City is Submerged and All Businesses are Closed</p>
<p>▲ Dikes Collapse and 200,000 Mu of Fields are Flooded</p>
<p>Wuhu dispatch: The water level in Wuhu has been gradually rising since the beginning of summer. At first, it was thought to be due to seasonal factors, but unexpectedly heavy rain poured down all day, lasting for almost two weeks, so that the water level increased unabated. Until the recent two days, the river water rose sharply, the tide flowed back, and the inland river rushed down due to torrential mountain floods, like pouring water from a high place. The entire city of Wuhu is now like an island in the center. The core areas, such as Dama Road, Erjie, Changjie, and Doumen Alley, are all submerged, reaching a depth of more than two feet. Even rickshaws are at risk of floating. All businesses and shops are closed. The avenues where cars and horses used to gallop are now areas where rafts and basins wander, and the scene is extremely tragic. Areas such as Dongmen and Jinmamen are slightly lower in elevation, and the water depth has reached more than seven feet. The Nanchengmen is completely submerged. The Public Security Bureau has prohibited pedestrians from traveling to avoid drowning. The houses along the Merchants' Wharf along the river only have a foot or so exposed above the water. Most of the residents have moved to higher ground to build sheds for shelter. In addition to the Wanzi Society, which has already raised 2,000 thousand copper coins for distribution, officials, gentry, and all sectors are now continuing to seek ways to provide relief. The disaster is even more severe in the villages and polder fields. Wuhu is a rice-producing area, with a total of more than 400,000 mu of farmland. After the flood broke out, County Magistrate Yu Yu-ying led various polder affairs bureaus to go to the villages to carry out rescue work every day. Therefore, only small polders such as Baotai and Dingba collapsed. Unexpectedly, the Shangfenglin and Xiafenglin polders, the first polders in the southern countryside of Wuyi, suddenly collapsed for more than five feet last night. In addition to using civilian boats and sacks to block and rescue, the villagers immediately beat gongs and rushed to the county government to report the alarm. County Magistrate Yu rushed to supervise the rescue overnight. The real reason was that the rain was heavy and the wind was strong, and it was impossible to recover. The collapse continued until 3:00 AM this morning. The rescuers were almost killed by the flood. Unexpectedly, by 3:00 PM today, the river tide had increased again, and the water level suddenly increased by more than two feet, causing the Mapu polder, which is adjacent to the Fenglin polder, to overflow and become unrecoverable by 3:00 PM this afternoon. It is estimated that a total of about 170,000 to 180,000 mu of fertile land has been submerged, and the deaths and losses of livestock and houses are even more difficult to count. Until the time of publication, it is still raining heavily, and the water level is still increasing every hour. People are panicked and cannot live in peace. The telegram from Wuhu County Magistrate Yu Yu-ying to Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government is recorded below: (Privately, because the situation of the Fenglin polder was critical, the county magistrate has already reported in detail in the Yang Jing telegrams. The county magistrate rushed to the polder with the team at the second watch of the night of July 23 to supervise the polder directors and polder chiefs to do their best to rescue. The reported dangerous places have already been turned from danger to safety. However, last night's heavy rain continued with strong winds all night. Mountain floods broke out and the river tide flowed backwards, rushing straight down, like pouring water from a high place. The water surface was more than a foot higher than the polder embankment, and the added child embankment also collapsed, causing the place where the polder was close to Tiancheng Lake to be flooded at 3:00 AM on the night of July 23. The rescue was not effective until 8:00 AM on the 24th, causing it to collapse. Fenglin and Mapu are only separated by a dike. Now we are moving all our efforts to protect Mapu (reporter's note: Mapu has collapsed after this telegram was sent). However, the sky is not clear and the wind does not stop, and I am deeply anxious. In addition to reporting the details at any time, I respectfully report it. Wuhu County Magistrate Yu) (24th)</p>
<h3>Tao Dunli Escapes in Shenyang</h3>
<p>▲ The Military Law Office Orders Strict Apprehension</p>
<p>▲ The Warden of the Detention Center Has Been Detained</p>
<p>Shenyang dispatch: Mr. Tao Dunli, who was arrested in Beidaihe last autumn for plotting a mutiny, has been handed over to the Military Law Office for interrogation since he was escorted to Shenyang. He has not yet been sentenced and is being held in the detention center of the First Prison. The treatment is very generous. Last month, Tao asked someone to intercede for him due to illness. With the permission of the Military Law authorities, he can go out to the Japanese-run Red Cross Hospital for diagnosis and treatment every day. A certain Yang is sent by the detention center to accompany him in and out to monitor his actions. Tao often goes to his residence in Zhonghua Lane, Wuwei Road, in the commercial district, in addition to going to the hospital, but still returns to the detention center every night to stay. This has been going on for a month, and many people do not suspect that he has anything else. Unexpectedly, Tao went out as usual on the afternoon of the 20th of this month and did not return until night. At about 11:00 PM, the detention center sent someone to visit Tao's residence. They found the doors were tightly closed and the place was empty. A certain Yang, who was monitoring Tao, also disappeared at the same time. It is not known whether he escaped with him or was murdered. At this point, the detention center could do nothing but report the situation to the Military Law Office.

<p>▲Past Davis Cup Winners</p>
<p>The Davis Cup world tennis tournament began in 1900. To date, it has been held for thirty-one years. It was suspended for four years during the European War. Listed below are the winners of each edition:</p>
<p>1900丨1902 United States</p>
<p>1903丨1906 Great Britain</p>
<p>1907—1911 Australasia</p>
<p>1912 Great Britain</p>
<p>1913 United States</p>
<p>1914 Australasia</p>
<p>1915—1918 European War (No Tournament)</p>
<p>1919 Australasia</p>
<p>1920—1926 United States</p>
<p>1927—1931 France</p>
<p>Total</p>
<p>France 5 times United States 11 times</p>
<p>Great Britain 5 times Australasia 7 times</p>
<p>▲14,000 Spectators Watch in the Rain</p>
<p>During the match between Austin and Borotra, a light drizzle fell. As Cochet and Gregory entered the court, the rain intensified. Whether such a final match should be held was a question. However, the crowd clamored, and the players had no choice but to comply reluctantly. In reality, the court was slippery, and finding a firm foothold was extremely difficult. Later, the spectators watched in the rain, their cheers and shouts so enthusiastic that they completely forgot they were in a storm. There were about 14,000 spectators.</p>
<p>▲Gregory's Initial Lead and Subsequent Loss Regrettable</p>
<p>Gregory's loss to Cochet is extremely regrettable. Having gained the upper hand, he ultimately failed. This was the case in both the first and third sets. In the first set, Gregory led 4-1 but then lost five consecutive games, losing the set 4-6. In the second set, Gregory again took a four-game lead before Cochet won a single game, with Gregory winning decisively 6-1. In the third set, Gregory again led 5-2, but unexpectedly failed, and the set extended to sixteen games, with Cochet winning. In the fourth set, Cochet fully displayed his talent and won effortlessly. It was his best performance in two years.</p>
<p>▲French Fans Celebrate, Transforming the Court</p>
<p>Cochet's victory lay in his unpredictable tactics. Gregory's groundstrokes were very effective, and Cochet was often pressured by them. However, Gregory could not resist the French player's fierce attacks.</p>
<h3>The Exuberance of Cochet, World Tennis Champion, After His Victory</h3>
<p>After the match concluded, the French were ecstatic. Umbrellas, straw hats, cushions, and newspapers were thrown onto the court, turning it into a pile of garbage, a remarkable sight.</p>
<p>▲Victory or Defeat Depends Entirely on Doubles</p>
<p>After Great Britain won the tournament in 1912, they overcame all opponents this year to once again reach the final week. However, they fell short, losing 3-2. The key to their failure was the lack of a strong doubles team. France had one strong and one weak singles player, while the two British players were evenly matched. Therefore, the singles matches were evenly contested, and the outcome depended on the doubles match. Whoever won the doubles match would win the championship.</p>
<p>▲Cochet, the French Hero</p>
<p>France's continued victory this year is entirely due to Cochet. Borotra completely failed in both of his singles matches. They relied on Cochet's heroic performance, defeating Austin, then Gregory, and pairing with Brugnon to defeat the British Hughes and Kingsley. He fought for three consecutive days, winning all three matches. If France can maintain its victory for another year, it will be solely due to Cochet's efforts.</p>

<h3>A New Aspect of Chinese Education</h3>
<p>—Central Political School (II) by Ye Xing</p>
<p>In addition, there are several affiliated special classes, such as the Xikang Student Special Training Class, with a total of thirty-three students. The four-month training has already been completed and the students have graduated. There is also the Verification Personnel Training Institute, with a total of twenty-eight students. The six-month training has also been completed and the students have graduated. The Mongolian, Tibetan, and Overseas Chinese Student Special Training Class has a total of twenty-four students. The two-and-a-half-year training will be completed this year. Among these three affiliated special classes, the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Overseas Chinese Student Special Training Class has the longest training period and therefore the best results. There is also a Mongolian and Tibetan class, which began training last October, with fifty-four students training for two years. The education in this special class, in addition to focusing on general social sciences, particularly emphasizes issues such as agriculture and animal husbandry, in order to prepare for the reform of the nomadic life and society in Mongolia and Tibet. Another Overseas Chinese class will be established in the second half of the year, recruiting young Overseas Chinese from various regions. However, this class has not yet been formally established. Recently, in order to promote the establishment and reform of national statistics and accounting, and to provide university graduates with specialized knowledge and skills, so as to provide a career path, the National Government has repeatedly discussed the establishment of special statistics and accounting classes by the Central Political School, recruiting university graduates. The training period will be one and a half to two years, with strict training. After graduation, the National Government will dispatch them to work. However, due to insufficient school buildings, it has not yet been opened. It is possible that these two special classes will be opened after a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>Because of the school's strict discipline and good academic atmosphere, everyone wonders how it can be done, but they do not pay attention to its educational policy. The current educational work of the Central Political School is integrated with the academic affairs. There is an educational committee, which is responsible for guiding students' academic studies, cultivation, and extracurricular activities. The school believes that military training is an important part of the entire education. Therefore, the school's military training is not just military drills, but also includes the most important part of military training: military management. The students are organized into a large team, which is further divided into several teams and several squads. People with military knowledge and long-term military training are responsible. It not only pays attention to form, but also to the spirit of the military, cultivating the important virtues of soldiers such as neatness, solemnity, hard work, endurance, agility, and simplicity. The students' lives are very disciplined. For example, every day at 6:00 AM, after the wake-up call is played, everyone must get up, and the squad leader leads the running. After the class bell is played, everyone goes to class, and there is no tardiness or absenteeism. When the meal bell rings, the whole group gathers on the playground, forms a team, and enters the dining hall in an orderly manner. Before hearing the bedtime bell, the dormitory is quiet, with no one to be seen. After the bedtime bell, all the students are in the dormitory, enjoying their sweet dreams. Therefore, the students' actions and habits are very disciplined and orderly. The students' lives in the school, in addition to seeking knowledge, are also a very united military life. The organization of the dormitory and the arrangement of the beds—this is what is called internal affairs in the military—are very regular and must be checked by the squad leader every day. Because neatness and uniformity are required, the uniforms and military blankets are issued by the school. Tuition and accommodation fees are of course not charged, and there is also a monthly food allowance of eight yuan and a subsidy of three yuan.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation in Nepal and a Brief History of Its Initial Submission</h3>
<p>— Tian Hen</p>
<p>Since the news of Nepal's invasion of Tibet spread last year, the people of the country have begun to pay attention to this small country in East Asia, knowing that although it is small, it is still a completely autonomous country in East Asia. We have often admired Siam for being able to do what we cannot, actually abolishing unequal treaties and regaining consular jurisdiction. Unexpectedly, Nepal, located between India and Tibet, has repeatedly suffered from the aggression of powerful England, but has never yielded, signing an equal treaty of peace. To this day, the British still dare not covet it. Compared with Siam, it is in a different league. And the so-called "upper country" of divine and bright descendants has declined to this point. Is it not shameful? Nepal, also known as Gurkha, is located on the southern foothills of the Himalayas. Its area is more than 50,000 square miles, about the size of our Jiangsu Province. The capital is Kathmandu. The population is about six million, half of whom are Gurkhas who believe in Brahmanism, and half are Nepalis who believe in Tibetan Lamaism. Political power is in the hands of the Gurkhas. Under the king, there are seven chief officials in charge of military, political, financial, legal, agricultural, industrial, and commercial affairs. The standing army is only 80,000 men, stationed in various places. There is also a guard army of 20,000 men, protecting the capital. There is also a bodyguard army of 10,000 men, guarding the palace. There is also an iron cavalry guard of 5,000 men, wearing ancient armor, with a sword on the left side of the waist and a short cannon on the right. There is also a reserve army of 100,000 men. They are not questioned in peacetime as farmers or merchants. However, they must drill three times a year. In case of emergency, they can be called into the army in a moment. The whole country is mountainous, so there are no railways. The capital is also located between two opposing mountains. There are only mountain climbers as a convenient means of transportation. There are a total of eight factories in the country, manufacturing ancient swords and new-style guns. The swords produced are sharp and durable, famous throughout the world. After the British army swallowed Bhutan, they wanted to annex Nepal, thinking it was a small country, a thing in a bag. Unexpectedly, the Nepalese army was brave and good at fighting, and because of the terrain, the Nepalese army climbed mountains and crossed ridges as if walking on flat ground. The British army had never learned this before, and they failed repeatedly. They finally signed an equal treaty, recognizing Nepal as a completely autonomous country in East Asia, to this day. Nepal used to be a vassal state of our country, and still cherishes the Han virtue. Therefore, they treat the Han people very well. They are arrogant to the British, and the British can do nothing about it. Today, we Han people are quite pleased that Nepal is our vassal state. But very few people know the history of its initial submission. Therefore, I have also recorded it. The matter was in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. The country was originally inhabited by barbarians. It was divided into the Ye Leng, Bu Yan, and Mu San divisions. Later, the western chieftain Bu La merged them and called it the Gurkha country. At that time, the Panchen Lama was the sixth. Because Emperor Gaozong was celebrating his birthday, he came to Beijing to offer congratulations and received a lot of rewards and donations from princes and ministers. Just as he was about to return to Tibet, he suddenly fell ill with smallpox and died. His followers took his remains back for burial. The assets were swallowed up by the Panchen Lama's brother, Zhongba Hushi Ketu. Not only did he not donate to the temple, but his brother, Marpa, could not share a penny. He was indignant and entered Gurkha, inciting them to invade Tibet. Emperor Gaozong first ordered the bodyguard Bazhong, generals E Hui and Chengde, and others to assist Tibet in suppressing Gurkha. Bazhong and others were afraid of trouble and did not fight. They negotiated with the Gurkha king, inducing him to send envoys to pay tribute, with the condition that Tibet would pay 5,000 taels of gold a year. They also did not clearly inform Tibet. The Gurkha army temporarily withdrew, and Bazhong and others also returned. Later, the Gurkha king asked Tibet for annual tribute. The matter was exposed. Emperor Gaozong was furious and ordered Duke Jiayong, Fukang'an, to be the general and Duke Chaoyong, Hailancha, to be the advisor, and launched a large-scale expedition to Gurkha. Hailancha was a famous general at that time. He won every battle. The Qing army went straight into Gurkha. The Gurkha king was desperate and asked for peace. They did not allow it. The Qing army advanced again, directly approaching the capital. The Gurkha king asked India for help. Although they agreed, the troops did not arrive for a long time (at that time, India was already a British colony). The situation became more and more urgent. He had no choice but to humbly seek peace. Fukang'an agreed. It was then established as a vassal state, receiving official seals. A tribute was made every five years. There were no rebellions throughout the Qing Dynasty. In the early years of Xuantong, they still sent envoys to pay tribute, but they stopped because the revolution was obstructed. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty, the countries of Annam, Burma, Siam, Ryukyu, and Korea all received official seals and offered tributes. How could they have expected what has happened today? Alas.</p>
<h3>Lament for Continuous Rain</h3>
<p>— Ming Fei</p>
<p>Nanjing has had more than ten days of heavy rain. The streets and alleys are covered with several feet of water. Du Shaoling's lament for autumn rain cannot compare to this sorrow. I write a lament for continuous rain.</p>
<p>The dark clouds gather, unwilling to open. The heavy rain continues, followed by drizzle. The incessant rain has lasted for ten days. Moss grows on the walls of my tall house. The east window is shaded, and the sun cannot be seen. I knew long ago that the strings would loosen, and the zither would become damp. The moisture reaches my fingertips, and the chess pieces are cold. The ink dissolves with the glue and cannot form a juice. Sitting idly, nothing can be done. I want to go out with an umbrella and clogs, but where can I go? The floodwater on Chang'an Avenue is several feet deep. I watch the children merrily pulling boats into the city. The thoroughfares are like this. How are the lanes? Hunger prevents me from leaving my door. Frogs breed in the submerged stove. The people eat fish. I heard that when the post road was built in those years, millions of gold were spent, but they still hated it being too little. The old canals were all cut off. The new canals are too crudely made. Every year the rain gathers and the water does not flow. The residents stand in the headwaters of the ditch. They use the governance of the people as a pretext for their greed. Sea merchants boast about talking about Yingzhou. Yingzhou is separated by misty waves. They imagine fairy mountains and startle each other. The blind lead the blind, taking each other on. Only the constant rain confirms their madness. It is over. The old man is deaf and dumb. He only teaches his son to speak Xianbei. He sits high on the city walls and scolds the Han people. He likes to boast about his cloth drum in front of the Thunder Gate.</p>
<h3>Nine-Sounding Celestial Bird</h3>
<p>— Zhe Cun</p>
<p>The Nine-Sounding Celestial Bird. Commonly called the Nine-Headed Bird. Its appearance is indeed nine-headed, hence the name. The Classic of Mountains and Seas says that it is a type of large sea bird. My hometown is on the coast of the East Sea, about two hundred miles away, close to the Doulong and Xinyang ports. The residents use the cry of the Nine-Sounding Celestial Bird to predict wind and rain. I have only heard its cry but never seen its head. I have only heard it at night and never in the daytime. Its cry is melodious and small, like a group of male and female small birds harmonizing their songs. Wind and rain are sure to follow when it cries, or heavy wind and rain. It is always accurate. Hearing it late at night makes one feel sad. When I was a child, I occasionally heard its cry and was quite frightened. I suspected that it was not far away in the sky, so I ran to my late mother, clinging to her lap and not daring to go to another room. In fact, the cry is very loud. When wind and rain are about to come, they feel an unbearable dryness and itching between their feathers, so they must fly high into the sky and soar over the sea to enjoy themselves. Since they fly so high, their cries can naturally reach far. Those hundreds of miles away who hear it seem to think its cry is not loud. Occasionally, seafarers see it at night, and its wings are enough to cover the sky. Qi Jiguang's New Book of Effective Disciplines contains many accounts of using wind and rain to predict weather, including the saying that the Nine-Sounding Celestial Bird appearing means wind and rain, one cry for wind, two cries for rain, three or four cries for wind and rain to cease, etc. However, its nature is such that it does not rise unless there is wind and rain. Once it flies out and cries, it can be determined that there will surely be wind and rain. The records in Qi's book are still based on real experience. This month, the overcast rain has not stopped for ten days. At night, I hear its cries. The bitter wind and rain have turned everything far and wide into a swamp. The water in low-lying areas has become a disaster. Therefore, I especially record this.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on the Lives of American Women (II)</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Hobbies   Two or three years ago, mahjong was once popular in the United States. Women regarded it as a noble game, even forgetting to eat and sleep in order to fight on the square city. But now everyone has abandoned it. American women are inherently mobile. They flock to all novel things like ducks. After the craze passes, no one will consult them. This is fundamentally different from the conservative psychology of Eastern nations. Ordinary women mostly like to smoke and drink. Although the American alcohol ban is very strict, ban it if you will, drink it if you will. They still secretly drink at home. The government has no way to investigate and ban it. Except for middle school girls, university students, family ladies, and professional women almost six out of ten like to smoke. In every university student lounge, you can see many girls smoking. However, they watch what place they are in. They never smoke while walking on the street, playing in the park, or at formal banquets. Because they value politeness most, keep order most, and fear being annoying most. Movies, dancing, and horseback riding are still very popular. Everyone in America knows how to dance. This is a noble entertainment for guests at large banquets and social gatherings. It is definitely not like the ones on the sea that are solely for business purposes and leave social people with an excuse to harm social customs. Second, in terms of sports hobbies, such as golf and tennis, they are very popular. Now summer swimming is even more enthusiastic. On the shore of the Chicago Michigan River, the total number of people swimming every day averages more than 30,000. Analyzing it, six or seven out of ten are women. Although men are less free than women due to occupational relationships, it can also be seen that women have a strong interest in swimming.</p>
<p>▲ Socializing Socializing in the open has long been implemented in American society. Ordinary people think that since men and women socialize in the open, wouldn't many jokes come out in society? In fact, it is not the case. Because they or they are all educated, very polite, and have good character. Between each other, they just break down a layer of estrangement and treat each other with courtesy. The so-called "gentleman respects himself" will not have base thoughts and behaviors. Men know many female friends, and women know many male friends, but they are limited to friendship. They will not be involved in love or marriage. It can be seen that the more opportunities men and women have to contact each other in normal times, the more they can avoid many unexpected problems. Otherwise, if both sides cannot understand each other, they will think that everything about the opposite sex is mysterious, and arouse the impulse of curiosity. Therefore, thinking that "socializing in the open" is wrong is a wrong view. Five years ago, the number of female students and male students at Northwestern University in the United States was in a ratio of three to one. The reason is that there are many wealthy families in the nearby villages, and women have the opportunity to receive a university education. At that time, there were naturally more opportunities for male and female students to socialize. According to the speculation of ordinary people's psychology, wouldn't it give the male students the convenience to woo love? However, according to the results of the survey, male and female students have never had a fact that someone fell in love with someone. It is enough to see that socializing is socializing. Love is love. The two cannot be confused into one. Every Saturday, various gatherings are held in any university in the United States to connect the feelings of classmates and relax their exhausted spirits. There are so-called class reunions, fraternities, sororities, etc. There are many interesting entertainments in that kind of meeting, such as tea parties, chats, music, dancing... etc., everything is available. Both men and women go to class reunions. Fraternity members can bring their girlfriends. Sorority members can also bring their boyfriends. The interaction between the sexes is completely free. However, parents still have some restrictions on women under the age of twenty who have not graduated from middle school and who have weak knowledge and abilities.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Storytelling</p>
<h3>Woman, Woman (II)</h3>
<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>Miss Ding returned home, feeling a little isolated. Her father had passed away long ago, and only she and her mother were left in the family; in addition, there was a hired maid, Qiu Zi.</p>
<p>Qiu Zi was quite lovable: she seemed like Miss Ding's younger sister, and Mrs. Ding also loved her. Usually, when Miss Ding was at school, Qiu Zi often took care of everything at home alone. Mrs. Ding was forty-five years old, and her daily life was just reciting scriptures and worshiping Buddha. She didn't like to interfere with other things. Miss Ding, on the other hand, was not so much a pampered girl as an innocent child. Her lively personality and beautiful face received the admiration of many people, and she was the target of everyone's attention at school; but she herself didn't take it to heart.</p>
<p>Only she herself knew, and perhaps Qiu Zi knew a little, that she also had some closer friends. Because during the holidays, whenever there was a phone call or a letter, Qiu Zi always received it first. What she often found strange and delighted was that the person who called Miss Ding was often a male voice, saying that his surname was "Li;" and the letters that were sent sometimes came one a day, and sometimes even two a day. The envelope was always written with "Li Jian."</p>
<p>Therefore, Qiu Zi often joked with Miss Ding: sometimes, when she heard the doorbell ring, she would say, "Mr. Li is here:" sometimes, she would even laugh and ask Miss Ding to see Mr. Li's picture. Miss Ding never got angry. In this way, in Qiu Zi's expectation, the facts became even clearer. Therefore, the question of "What kind of person is Mr. Li after all" had powerfully occupied Qiu Zi's expectations.</p>
<p>One evening, Qiu Zi was wandering idly in front of the door. Suddenly, a young man in a suit stood in front of her. She immediately felt that this was a stranger she had never known; but at the same time, in her quick comprehension, she had already affirmed that this unknown guest was Mr. Li she had been expecting.</p>
<p>"Is this Ding Mansion? Is Miss Ding at home?" the young man had already asked.</p>
<p>"Yes! Miss is at home! What is your honorable surname?" Qiu Zi laughed to herself; she later thought that this last sentence was redundant.</p>
<p>However, the visitor's answer finally exceeded Qiu Zi's expectations. When the sound of "My surname is Lu" was softly uttered from the young man's mouth, Qiu Zi was really a little strange.</p>
<p>"Please come inside and sit down!" Qiu Zi suspiciously led Mr. Lu inside.</p>
<p>After going inside to report, Qiu Zi saw Miss Ding change into a newly made long cheongsam, and lightly applied some powder in front of the mirror. Then she hurriedly walked to the reception room.</p>

<h3>Financial Market Gold Prices Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>▲Not Yet Exceeding Sixty Taels: Yesterday, the 27th, the gold price continued its strong upward trend, fluctuating wildly, unable to advance or retreat, hovering around 755 taels. The market overall showed a retrospective of nine taels, eventually rising three taels. However, industry sentiment was uncertain, so it did not easily exceed 60 taels. As for the silver market, it initially declined, then opened high, and had already broken through 50 taels, with many buyers still present. Subsequently, it was seen at over 58 taels. Although foreign exchange shrunk by half a point, the domestic market was also favorable but not very tense. Banks were still willing to sell, and many parties within the market were willing to unload, causing the price to decline again. It weakened slightly, once reaching the border of 50 taels. Finally, it seemed to show signs of easing, fluctuating around 53 taels. Based on the situation of the international silver market, the gold price might rise, but considering the domestic situation and the news that Mexico might change its silver currency, it is difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>▲Opening Jumps Six Taels: The opening price for September delivery this morning jumped six and a half taels, to 756 taels. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of two taels. Yuan Cheng Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yu Chang and others were buying. According to telegraphs, the big silver bars had fallen by five-sixteenths the day before, and the forward prices fell by a quarter. Silver prices, both public and private telegrams, had decreased by three-eighths, mainly due to sales from both China and India, while buyers were scarce. Banks also engaged in interbank trading of September English gold at 13, causing the price to jump from 54 and a half taels to 58 and a half taels. Before long, Fu Chang, Yuan Heng, Qian Chang Xiang, Wan Xing, Shun Li, Chang Sheng Yong and others all sold, and HSBC and others were offering English gold at 13, causing the price to fall by five taels. At 9:20 AM, it was at 53 taels and two mace. When the listed English gold contracted by 0.125, US dollars by 0.125, and Japanese gold increased by one fen, it returned to 55 taels. Items were purchased briefly, then suppressed by more than two taels. The Dalian gang and others unloaded, especially HSBC, which offered September English gold at 13.0625, reaching 52 taels and eight mace by 9:45 AM. Afterwards, Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Xin Heng, Yu Da and others all bought, so it gradually rose by four or five taels, though there were fluctuations of one or two taels in between. The English gold turned better, finally settling at 1.29375 for 13. By almost 11:00 AM, it was at 57 taels five or six mace. Fu Chang, Yi Feng Yong, Ri Chang, Ding Chang, Shun Li and others sold, causing it to retreat to 55 taels. After 11:15 AM, buyers seemed more active, adding one tael. Then, the Indian exchange reported a small drop of two annas, adding another tael, reaching 57 taels after 11:30 AM. Qian Chang Xiang, Da De Cheng and others sold, and English gold could be purchased at 13, so it was cut by more than two taels, to 54 taels and five mace. At that time, it added another tael and a half, but the closing price was still suppressed to 55 taels. The announced price was changed to 797 taels and four mace, calculating a difference of 42 or 43 taels to 44 or 45 taels. At noon, it was 40 taels, then recalculated at more than 42 taels.</p>
<p>▲Slight Softening Before Closing: The market opened at 54 and a half taels, then Shun Li and others sold, causing it to fall from 54 taels and seven or eight mace to one and a half taels. HSBC and others sold English gold at 13, but there was a fluctuation of more than one tael in a short time. After 2:30 PM, buyers seemed to be active, and McCalle and others absorbed English gold at 13, adding one tael. At 3:45 PM, the Indian exchange telegraphed a slight drop of one anna, so it rose to 54 taels one or two mace. Unexpectedly, the exchange market still showed a flat and strong trend. HSBC again offered 13, with more supply than demand, causing the price to suddenly fall into a tired state, depreciating by more than four taels. At 4:00 PM, it ended at 49 and a half taels, but this price was very difficult to obtain. It was said that it broke through 50 taels at one point, and the closing price was raised by many parties. Therefore, at 4:30 PM, the closing price was calculated at 52 taels and seven mace, and it was traded at more than three taels afterward, then at two taels and five or six mace. Compared to last Saturday, the listed price was up three taels and two mace. The largest overall price was 58 and a half taels, and the smallest was 49 and a half taels, a difference of nine taels.</p>

<h3>Reports of Silver Supply Showing Signs of Improvement</h3>
<p>The tight silver supply in Shanghai has been a long-standing problem, and it has become even more deserted during this summer season. However, there are reports that the supply will improve later. The main reason is that a large quantity of foreign wheat is arriving in Shanghai, and the money for this cargo urgently needs to be cleared, in a very large quantity. Therefore, the silver call loan rate improved slightly yesterday, and the surcharge on checks even exceeded 1 qian, almost reaching 2 qian. According to those in the industry, the silver call loan rate was originally intended to be raised to around 2 qian yesterday. Because there are not many days left in this month, they feared that the total amount of silver call loans for the entire month would exceed 2 taels, so they forcibly suppressed it in recent days. It is expected to rise after the end of this month. Even without a large increase, it will at least be above 1 qian. If the financial sector has other needs, it is beyond our expectations, and the rise of the silver supply is a matter of course.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Rise Slightly, Trend Stable</h3>
<p>Transactions Reach Over 19 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of trading for the July public bonds, and trading will be suspended starting today in order to prepare for settlement. Also yesterday, the requirement to provide spot goods for selling August contracts was cancelled and replaced with the collection of margin, to facilitate hedging. Therefore, the market situation was generally not deserted, and spot trading was still very brisk. As for the changes in the prices of various bonds, there were no changes in the bond market environment, and the major players were observing and not moving due to the approaching settlement. As a result, demand and supply were balanced, and the trend was sluggish. The fluctuations between the morning and afternoon markets were still very slight. Only the scattered demand on the market was slightly stronger, and the prices rose slightly compared to last weekend, but only by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. The August consolidated 6% customs duties and July financial bonds continued to fall slightly. The total daily spot trading volume was 6,000 yuan, and the futures trading volume reached 19 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Large Volume of Spot Yarn Transactions</h3>
<p>▲Yunnan and Guangdong Gangs Start Purchasing</p>
<p>▲The Exchange Market Trend is Not Driven Up</p>
<p>Spot cotton yarn sales were unusually brisk, with all gangs showing signs of excitement, and coarse yarn accounting for the majority. The Yunnan and Guangdong gangs were the most active in purchasing, so spot prices were very tight, causing some people to be slightly shaken. However, the previous session's closing on the exchange market suddenly rose due to the news of Yunnan and Guangdong purchases, and the market trend became tight, rising by 0.08 or 0.09 yuan. But by the afternoon, it turned tired again. Although there were more than 7,000 bales of spot yarn transactions, the market not only did not rise, but instead tended to fall, which was very puzzling. In short, if the actual demand can continue unabated, there should be another upward trend in the future.</p>
<p>▲More Declines Than Rises in the Exchange Market: The opening of the exchange market settled with long positions, and the market trend fell by 0.07 or 0.08 yuan. The second and third sessions opened with a sudden rise in spot sales news, with each month rising by 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, or 0.09 yuan. Although there were more than 7,000 bales in the afternoon following the Yunnan and Guangdong business, sentiment on the trading floor remained flat, with each month falling by 0.06, 0.07, or 0.08 yuan. The total transaction volume was 41,900 bales. It was found that Rong Xing sold 1,500 bales, Geng Feng 850 bales, Yi Yu 850 bales, and Shen Chang 1,100 bales. Shen Ji bought 1,850 bales, Rui Da 2,500 bales, Yi Chang 1,050 bales, He Shen 950 bales, Gong Tai 650 bales, Yu Da 600 bales, and Tian Long 600 bales. The closing prices of the exchange market are recorded below.</p>
<p>Exchange Market Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Inventory: Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Inventory</p>
<p>July  163.6  Down 0.03  20,400 October  163.5  Down 0.04  94,750</p>
<p>August 164.9  Up 0.01  77,050  November 163.9   3 85,950</p>
<p>September  162.6  Down 0.01  99,250 December 164.5   5 69,950</p>
<p>▲More Than 7,000 Bales of Spot Yarn Sold: Spot yarn sales were quite brisk. Statistics show that all gangs bought more than 7,000 bales throughout the day, with fellow traders buying 300 bales and market conditions trending firm. Customers from Guangdong bought 1,700 bales, Sichuan 1,400 bales, Yunnan 1,700 bales, Qingdao 225 bales, Shantou 450 bales, Tianjin 1,000 bales, Hankou 180 bales, and other gangs 350 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Outlook Lax</h3>
<p>American cotton is consistently falling, and Indian cotton is following suit, but foreign exchange remains tight. Although the rain has stopped in this port, the damage to cotton fields everywhere has been great, and the development of new cotton has been severely affected. Therefore, mainland gangs have unusually strong purchasing intentions, but Huoji gangs and Jia gangs are still selling off, so the pressure is still heavy and unable to stabilize, and the outlook is quite loose.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Market Recent Decline 0.03 Yuan: The Exchange opened its Hankou raw cotton exchange floor because of the depression in the foreign cotton market and the weather had cleared up. The market was once again softer and third session rallied. The market ended with recent deliveries dropping between 0.05 and 0.03 yuan and distant deliveries gaining 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon the weather seemed to be clearing so the market generally dropped 0.01 to 0.025 yuan. A total of 116,700 piculs changed hands, with Rongxing selling 4000 piculs, Shenji selling 1400, Yukang selling 2800 and Ruida selling 2000 piculs. On the buying side, Jifeng bought 3000, Tianlong bought 3400, Heshen bought 3000, Yongfeng bought 3000, and Changfeng bought 3800 piculs. The table below shows the closing prices.</p>
<p>Closing Prices For Hankou Market 10-Month: 38.15, down 0.10, 185,000 total inventory.</p>
<p>7-Month: 38.00, down 0.03, 57,100 total inventory. 11-Month: 38.15, up 0.10, 206,400 total inventory.</p>
<p>8-Month: 38.20, up 0.03, 50,400 total inventory. 12-Month: 38.20, up 0.15, 164,500 total inventory.</p>
<p>▲No Cotton Inventory</p>
<p>Factory needs for cotton is quiet and no word of inventories incoming.</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Market is Slowly Rising</h3>
<p>▲New Pier: Yesterday the weather cleared and the number of incoming vessels from the interior was still low at about 14 or 15. Sales in the area were still good, with 1400 piculs of thick rice bought by the Changshu and Xixiang local merchants. Prices also rose by three jiao compared to the previous session. Kunshan and Liyang white rice prices rose 0.10 or 0.20 yuan due to brisk sales. Sales of Shibu and Chonggu thin rice remained high and prices rose by 0.50 yuan. Glutinous rice distilleries had extremely good demand causing price to rise. Nankang early rice and premium rice types arrived at good prices of slightly over 0.1 yuan. It is estimated that 5000 shih of Heshui foot rice and new rice from Zhoupu would be arriving in Shanghai over the next five or six days.</p>
<p>▲South Market: Sources were limited to types from Qingjiao 2, Nankang 5, Pinghu 4 and Sutong 3 and 4, with scant supplies at Pudong. Sales were slow in both urban and rural shops due to the clear weather, with little interest from the Ningbo area. Thick, hard rice price were up 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. The previous day's rice were a little slower. Thin rice inventories were slightly higher, but prices were unlikely to rise again after days of sharp increases because of the changing weather. A few Luo Yang premium rice arrivals caused prices to increase because of sharp increase in foreign rice prices, resulting in market increases. Yin rice arrived in short supply and saw good sales with prices up 0.20 or 0.30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Clear Weather Results in Weaker Flour Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of flattening and softening, because the sky had cleared up and sentiment inside and outside the industry was very hot. In addition, foreign wheat quotations showed that Canadian wheat had fallen by about one yuan, and Chicago wheat by about 0.30, 0.40, or 0.50 yuan. Although the international market situation is not currently affecting prices, the results will inevitably flow in. Therefore, people's hearts were seeing weakness, and some buyers had returned to the market to sell. Therefore, the opening prices of each price had fallen by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. Subsequently, a certain factory maintained the recent price, intending to sell long-term contracts, and Tianjin gangs also made slight purchases, so the sluggish situation turned stable again. In this situation, it is feared that it will circle around again. The total daily transaction volume was extremely brisk, reaching more than 1.5 million. The result was that this month was 0.0025 yuan lower than the previous week, August was 0.0025 yuan higher, September was 0.0075 lower, October was 0.005 lower, and November-December was 0.0075 lower.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed a sharp downward trend, because the sky cleared and foreign wheat quotations showed a large drop. Canadian wheat fell by about one yuan, and Chicago wheat fell by 0.30, 0.40, or 0.50 yuan. This kind of drop was completely an oversupply state, so people's hearts were too shaken, and the selling mood was extremely smooth. The generally floating long positions also quickly returned to sell, and the previous days' rise was completely cut down. This month, only January contracts were trading, and the opening price fell by 0.04 or 0.05 yuan. In the afternoon, speculative floating longs raised the price to 3.78 yuan at one point, with the lowest price at only 0.068 yuan, a difference of 0.01 yuan. The distant months went down all the way, and the degree of decline was very large. This month fell by 0.03 yuan, August-September fell by 0.08 yuan, October fell by 0.06 yuan, November fell by 0.07 yuan, and December fell by 0.06 yuan. Spot wheat was lacking in standard and high-quality goods, and the price rose by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. Kai Zhi Tang, Kunshan Shuangfeng, Taicang Hengjing, Chongming Penglai, and Yangzhou wheat totaled more than 4,000 bales, with 2,500 bales bought by Fu Xin, 700 bales by Hua Feng, and more than 800 bales by Xin Da.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Items of Wuxi New Silk Arrive</h3>
<p>This year's spring and summer cocoons in Wuxi have been poor, but 80-90% of the silk factories have started work. New silk heads have been transported to Shanghai. Yesterday, factories such as Zhen Yi and Yong Tai transported 155 items of new silk, factory leader's spun silk, soup cocoon, cocoon clothing, etc., all transported back to the warehouses by Shen Zhuang, to be arranged in different styles.</p>
<h3>European and American Silk Sales Become Even More Lifeless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai white factory silk, American sales remained stagnant, and in places such as London and Lyon, the stock market continued to weaken. The factory side observed and waited, and their enthusiasm for imports was also low. The market was calm. Yesterday, only Samsung imported three bales of cotton yellow reeling silk, and Ke Chang, etc., imported sixteen bales of yellow coarse silk, and the price remained stable.</p>
<h3>Needle Embroidery European Sales Continue to Be Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the local foreign tea market, needle-eye green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, and other places, British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Harmony, Jinlong, and Tongfu all started searching for goods. Transactions were unusually brisk, and sales prices rose by 0.04 or 0.05 yuan compared to last week. The core goods in the Zhenmei category were slightly more popular, and low-grade goods remained brisk. However, for the upper and middle grade goods, foreign firms could not relax their prices because international import prices were very tight, so transactions remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Wutun Tea Market</h3>
<p>When the Shanghai market was selling well and prices were high last month, all the tea firms in the Tun region deeply regretted not having procured more tea. Therefore, at that time, tea prices had risen to over 90 yuan. When the new Zi tea came out, everyone hoped that the Shanghai market would recover and prices would return to previous levels, so they enthusiastically purchased it. The highest asking price was also raised to 70 yuan and some change. Recently, seeing that the Shanghai market has been falling for a long time and it's difficult to recover, and that the price of Zhenmei tea has shrunk, enthusiasm has greatly decreased. Currently, the main focus is on finishing the processing of the purchased tea that is in storage. Tea merchants who have stockpiled unsold new tea are now seeing market prices plummet to 40 yuan per dan, only half of the initial opening price. Most tea merchants are suffering huge losses. The price of unrefined tea has remained relatively high due to the prevalence of flower tea production by shops and estates, and the asking price is still around 25 or 26 yuan. Although this is a decrease of three or four yuan compared to before, it is still the highest price compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Because the production of spring tea in Wu County this year was reduced, most tea firms did not purchase their full quota. Therefore, they competed to buy the new Zi tea. The general sentiment was that although the Shanghai market appeared weak, it would eventually recover. Unexpectedly, the Zhenmei market price continued to fall, and the Russian company's assistance was silent and inactive. The item of high-quality Gongxi tea has had its sales channels interrupted because the quality of the goods did not meet the sales needs of other firms. Those who were optimistic before are now lamenting the unpredictability of the tea market. The Zi tea that general tea merchants and firms stockpiled and hoarded in the past, hoping to profit from speculation, is now unwanted. In recent days, tea merchants who have tea on hand are rushing to tea firms to sell it off. Even though the price has dropped by 30 yuan per dan, most are still unwilling to increase their purchases. Fortunately, there is not much tea in storage on the market, so the impact is relatively small. However, traveling merchants are very anxious because they are unable to sell their tea and the market is quickly becoming outdated.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Goods After the Boycott</h3>
<p>▲Still Operating in Secret...Some are Repackaged as Parcels</p>
<p>▲Cloth from This Factory: Prices Have Been Rising Rapidly Recently, mainly because since the boycott began, fine cloth and fine twill from Japanese factories have been the first to rise in price, and existing stock has been completely bought up. Although guest merchants have been unable to ship goods as of yesterday, there is still a shortage of existing stock. Blue Chicken is selling for 7 taels and 6 mace and a half, Blue Sun for 7 taels and 4 mace and a half, Trumpet Child for 7 taels and 7 mace and a half, and Blue Flying Fish for 8 taels. There seems to be nothing left to buy, mainly because there is an extreme shortage of equivalent products from Chinese factories to replace them. Fine twill from Chinese factories has soared in price yesterday: Jincheng at 8 taels and 1 qian, Butterfly Ball at 7 taels and 6 mace and a half, an increase of about 6 qian compared to before. Coarse cloth has increased by 1 qian. Nine-pound Five Blessing Cat Eagle are all being sold out of customs for 5 taels, and eleven-pound cloth already requires 5 taels and 6 mace and a half.</p>
<p>▲East and West Piece Goods: The previous two days have been consistently dull. Since Eastern goods were largely seized by the anti-Japanese association, local merchants have been cautious and trading has slowed. However, some merchants have been shipping goods through the post office, and there is a trend along the Yangtze River of repackaging goods with Japanese trading companies to declare them, so even if inspections are strict, they are still operating in secret. The price of goods has fallen slightly, but existing stock is quite scarce, mainly because the stock that was previously stored has been completely sold off. Moganshan Zhigong woolen fabric is still being sought after by Hankou merchants, and existing stock is very scarce. Fine Serge is being purchased by both the Shaoxing and Changsha merchants, Sanyou Pattern is 3 qian and 4 fen, and Huxinting is 3 qian and 5 fen. Western goods are no longer comparable to what they used to be, and it is almost impossible to find common, marketable goods. Yesterday, the Shantou merchants traded more than 50 pieces of Striped Baling cloth, with prices averaging 2 qian and 87 fen, while other transactions have been quiet.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branches Arrive Sparsely, Prices Expected to Rise</h3>
<p>The first batch of Orchid Bamboo Branches that arrived last week were initially priced at around 50 to 48 taels. Considering the cost of land, this would certainly result in losses. However, the cost of land has not eased and has instead increased, so the market trend has become firmer. It has been found that only ten pieces were imported yesterday on the Jinan wheel steamer, a sharp decrease in supply. Therefore, the market is bound to increase in the future. Black Leaf Branches are selling briskly, and there is even greater hope for price increases. It is predicted that there will be an increase of two or three taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Quotations Quiet, Market Firm</h3>
<p>▲Taikoo Sugar Hikes Price by 2 Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were still no dispatches from the sugar-producing regions. Outside of the guild's quotations, the foreign exchange rate increased, showing a slight improvement. Dutch sugar #24 coarse granulated white sugar was traded at 11 taels and 4 mace and a half. Both supply and demand were scarce, and the market remained firm. #20 medium granulated white sugar was 11 taels, #8 Dutch red sugar was 9 taels and 2 qian, and finely ground white sugar was 11 taels and 5 mace and a half. Transactions were also sparse. Taikoo Cart Sugar B mark was quoted at 12 taels, and the futures market was at .05 points, DY mark at 10 taels and 8 qian. The market appeared firm. However, the company's existing stock is now quoted at 2 qian higher, with B mark requiring a price of 12 taels and 3 qian, which is still cheaper than the quoted price of 5 yuan and 6 jiao in Japanese currency.</p>

<h3>He Xiong Reports Victory in Telegram to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang yesterday received a telegram from Commander Xiong from Nanchang, stating: "Respected Commander Zhang Yuejun of Shanghai, The central Jiangxi Red Bandits have been cut into two sections by our army's surprise move from Ningdu and Xingguo, and their strength has been disintegrated. The remaining bandits in the area north of Xingguo are currently being encircled and suppressed. The southern Jiangxi area, which has been deeply entrenched as a bandit stronghold for several years, can be fundamentally cleared in the near future. Notified for your information. Respectfully, Xiong Shiyao." Due to lack of space, Mayor Zhang also received a telegram from General Commander He from Nancheng yesterday, stating: "Respected Mayor Zhang of Shanghai, According to an aircraft report, since yesterday afternoon, our army has successively occupied the bandit nests of Longgang and Gulonggang and is pursuing in different directions. Notified for your information. Respectfully, He Yingqin."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Intensifies Defense</h3>
<p>▲Headquarters Issued a Confidential Order to Comply</p>
<p>Headquarters recently issued a confidential order to the garrison troops of various counties along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, roughly stating: "Having received reports, a large number of Red Bandits have been dispatched from other places to Shanghai and various places along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, intending to secretly plot sabotage and deliberately cause trouble. At this critical time when the front lines are engaged in an emergency campaign to suppress the Red Bandits, the defense of the rear is particularly important. After receiving the order, the garrison troops in each area must properly defend against and prevent any negligence." Therefore, the military police in Shanghai, after receiving instructions from their respective superior authorities, have invisibly intensified their vigilance and defense in key locations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai to Hold a Citizens' General Assembly</h3>
<p>▲Location... Public Stadium</p>
<p>▲Date... The 30th of This Month</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, based on the reports from various associations across the city, including more than 50 groups such as trade associations and citizens' federations, has requested that at this time of domestic and foreign troubles, the national public, regarding the suppression of the Red Bandits, the campaign against Shi Yousan, and the implementation of economic severance against Japan, should urgently convene a general assembly of all citizens to provide a backing for the government, requesting approval for the record. After a meeting, the following resolutions were made: (1) Approval for the record; (2) The name is designated as the Shanghai Citizens' General Assembly for Suppressing Bandits, Punishing Rebels, Opposing Japan, and Aiding Overseas Chinese; (3) The date is set for 3:00 PM on the 30th of this month; (4) Location: Public Stadium in the Southern City; (5) Procedures: The presidium and venue staff shall be elected by the said assembly itself.</p>
<h3>The Vanishing of Japanese Goods in This City</h3>
<p>▲Customs Brokers Cease Handling</p>
<p>▲Ships Lack Cargo</p>
<p>Following the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the severance of economic ties with Japan, merchants from various regions took advantage of the lack of inspection to purchase large quantities of Japanese goods, causing prices to soar. After inspection measures were implemented and various regions responded, prices of Japanese goods fell. Since transportation and customs brokerage firms refused to handle them, Japanese goods have gradually disappeared. Details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Resolutions of Customs Brokers' Association The Customs Brokers Association convened a special meeting on the 26th regarding the anti-Japanese movement to discuss measures. More than two hundred members attended. The details are as follows: 1. Chairman's report: Chairman Shi Zhikun began by saying that since the Wan incident, Japanese imperialists have incited ignorant Korean people to kill our compatriots residing in Korea. The shocking news spread, causing great indignation throughout the country. Anti-Japanese associations have been organized everywhere, and economic ties with Japan have been severed to awaken Japanese imperialists. Shanghai has also formed an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to inspect Japanese goods. This association has always participated in anti-Japanese work and has a clear history. Since all sectors are united against Japan, this association will naturally participate. However, considering the poor results of past anti-Japanese associations and the corruption of a few staff members, patriotic people are sighing. He urged those present to maintain their patriotism and conduct a transparent boycott movement. He asked those present to express their opinions fully. 2. Resolutions on important matters: Regarding the Anti-Japanese National Salvation and Boycott of Japanese Goods, the following was decided at yesterday's members' meeting: (1) The association will organize an inspection team of forty members, who will be volunteers from the industry and will register with the association. (2) For Japanese ports (including Dalian), where no other shipping companies are available for transportation, if there are domestic products being shipped there, the Chamber of Commerce has been consulted for solutions. (3) Japanese goods detained by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association before the Chamber of Commerce meeting have been requested to be returned. (4) Although there are other shipping companies in Shantou and Xiamen, most of them are handling transit goods, making it necessary to load them on Japanese ships. The Chamber of Commerce has been consulted for solutions. (5) Donations to support compatriots should be made at the discretion of the members. (6) Whether to handle customs declarations for Japanese ships importing goods within five days has been referred to the Chamber of Commerce for a response. (7) Xu Youren was publicly recommended to attend the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Committee for the Study of Boycotting Japanese Goods, and Shi Zhikun was the review committee member. (8) An announcement was made immediately in the newspaper to stop handling customs declarations for Japanese goods and Japanese ships. (9) An announcement was made immediately to the industry to voluntarily stop using Japanese goods. 3. Announcement of boycott: Yesterday, the association issued an announcement stating that the Wan incident has not been resolved, and the disaster for compatriots in Korea has arrived. All Chinese people cannot sit idly by, and this association has no reason to refuse. A general meeting was convened on July 26, and it was unanimously decided to boycott Japan. From this day forward, all staff members of this association will voluntarily refuse to use Japanese goods and will stop handling customs declarations for Japanese goods and Japanese ships. This announcement is for your information.</p>
<p>▲Announcement from the Seafood Industry Association The Trade Union of the Seafood and Sundries Industry issued an announcement to its members regarding the boycott of Japanese goods, stating that it was an emergency notice. Based on the proposal of the association's temporary members' meeting on July 35 and the resolution of the Chamber of Commerce's temporary members' meeting regarding the registration of Japanese goods, it was unanimously passed at the time. All members were required to provide detailed accounts of Japanese goods imported before July 14 and register them with the association before the 28th of this month. This was to be submitted to the Chamber of Commerce and then registered with the Anti-Japanese Association. After that, they could be sold according to the regulations of the Anti-Japanese Association. Accordingly, this case is recorded and announced. It is hoped that you will check and handle it carefully. Furthermore, please do not sell the previously stored Japanese goods privately, lest you incur blame. As for the time and procedures for future sales, further announcements will be made after the regulations of the Anti-Japanese Association are obtained. Please take note.</p>
<p>▲Shortage of Cargo on Yangtze River Steamers Since the 24th, Chinese merchants have unanimously stopped loading Japanese goods. At the same time, it was agreed that Chinese goods would not be loaded on Japanese ships, and Chinese people would not travel on Japanese ships. Since the 25th, the export cargo of the Japanese Qing Company's Yangtze River ships has sharply decreased. The Nanyang Maru, heading upstream, only loaded over four thousand pieces. Yesterday, the Xiangyang Maru, heading downstream, only loaded six tickets of goods, totaling over one thousand seven hundred pieces. On the same day, the ship went to Hankou without a single piece of Chinese cargo. Except for a batch of sugar transported by Japanese people from Zhenjiang, the remaining cement, yarn, and other goods were less than one thousand pieces and were all foreign goods. Business was only 20-30% of what it was before the 23rd. The British Taikoo Yangtze River steamers were overwhelmed with export cargo. For example, the Wuxue and Wenzhou ships each loaded over twenty thousand pieces.</p>
<p>▲Decrease in Imports of Japanese Goods Since the 14th of this month, Japanese merchants have begun to rush their stockpiles to China. Within ten days, 300,000 bags of sugar, over 30,000 pieces of cloth, and 6,000-7,000 tons of sundries were shipped. The goods for August were also pre-shipped. Recently, as the Japanese goods arriving in Shanghai cannot be re-exported, most of them cannot be declared except for a few inferior goods that are used by Japanese merchants themselves. Large quantities of goods are no longer being shipped. Recently, the Mikasa, Maya, and Tsukuba ships have significantly reduced their cargo arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Attempt to Sabotage The Japanese were quite alarmed by the boycott. Yesterday, it was confirmed that the Osaka Japanese Chamber of Commerce had discussed countermeasures against our country's boycott. It was reported that a telegram was sent to Shanghai to send people to investigate the boycott and rescue methods. On the other hand, various industries in Osaka jointly raised five million yuan to sabotage China's boycott movement and ease the intense economic severance. It is said that the Japanese are already taking steps to handle it.</p>
<p>▲Telegram from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent a telegram to the national chambers of commerce yesterday, stating that since the Wanbaoshan incident, the Korean people under Japanese rule have carried out large-scale, organized massacres of overseas Chinese in Seoul, Pyongyang, Incheon, and other places. The Japanese authorities not only failed to stop it but also helped them commit abuse, issuing instructions, and allowing their henchmen to run rampant. The shocking news spread, causing great indignation. In addition to repeatedly telegraphing the central government to request serious negotiations with Japan and to protect and rescue overseas Chinese, the federation held its 32nd Standing Committee meeting to seriously discuss the matter. It was unanimously agreed that our country is facing many difficulties and foreign insults are constantly arriving. For now, the only way is to sever economic ties with Japan to awaken them. The way to save the country is to actively promote domestic goods. It was resolved to send a telegram to all chambers of commerce across the country, advising all sectors to uphold their conscience and implement the following three points: (1) Absolutely refuse to use Japanese goods. (2) Actively promote domestic products. (3) All factories should process and manufacture products, imitating foreign goods for utilization. Accordingly, this case is recorded and a telegram is sent to all chambers of commerce for their information. It is hoped that you will follow the resolution to resist foreign insults and protect our rights. We earnestly pray. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce; Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuli, Standing Committee Members.</p>
<p>▲Telegram from Wujin County Chamber of Commerce The Wujin County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Recently, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram stating that Japanese goods in the interior of Jiangsu Province are all imported through Shanghai. If Shanghai can check, detain, and completely eliminate them, then there will be no problems in the interior. Please lead and actively proceed to prevent the import of Japanese goods, which will greatly help preserve commerce. In the past, merchants have made mistakes. If we promote automatic anti-Japanese actions, we can avoid unexpected pain, and the boycott can achieve complete results. The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce's view is indeed a fundamental solution, and this association strongly agrees. In addition to complying with your chamber's telegram, notifying all trade associations, and each formulating measures to be submitted to the association for collective discussion and action, this special telegram is sent for your information and guidance. We are deeply hopeful, Wujin County Chamber of Commerce respectfully.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Pay Attention to Yu Qiaqing's Remarks</h3>
<p>▲Those Who Requested Correction National News Agency: Zhou Hanmei and seventy other citizens of this city sent a letter to Yu Qiaqing yesterday, stating: We respectfully write that after the Korean people's anti-Chinese incident occurred, thousands of our compatriots were killed or injured, and property losses amounted to no less than several million. The damage to overseas Chinese merchants in Korea was particularly severe. The news spread, shocking the country and the world. People from all walks of life in this city mourned the tragic killing of our compatriots and were angered by the rampage of Japanese imperialists. Therefore, they rushed about calling for revolution and promoting permanent economic severance with Japan. The business community in this city, seeing that overseas Chinese merchants were the first to bear the brunt, made the greatest effort in this anti-Japanese national salvation movement. We read your initial remarks, which stated, "This Korean people's anti-Chinese incident is, of course, the result of incitement by the Japanese government. The resolution of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Conference in this city to implement economic severance with Japan is a natural action for citizens. (Omission) If the citizens of this country do not have a thorough awakening this time, then national subjugation is imminent." Your calm and painful words were worthy of the attitude of a revolutionary business leader. All our citizens were filled with admiration. After you were elected chairman of the first meeting of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee in this city, we were even more delighted to have the right person, believing that the past anti-Japanese movements in this city often caused ridicule from our own people and pain from foreigners, only adding to the sad pages of our national history. In the future, under your leadership, the economic severance with Japan would be sustained and thorough, and the national consciousness of the people would be awakened. Our Chinese nation would have the opportunity to wash away the many humiliations inflicted by Japanese imperialists. Who knew that upon reading your recent remarks, we would be extremely disappointed and full of errors and contradictions. We love you deeply and are even more eager for the anti-Japanese movement. We use the qualification of compatriots and the legacy of the beloved and sincere Prime Minister Sun Yat-Sen to tell you: (1) Economic severance is the only effective way for a weak country to deal with a strong country. The non-cooperation movement of the Indian revolutionary leader Gandhi is clear evidence. Japanese imperialism is our country's greatest enemy, which everyone in the country can say. The fact that our country's past anti-Japanese movements have rarely been successful is a matter of deep regret for everyone in the country. You have hoped for a thorough awakening of the people and have vehemently stated that without a thorough awakening, national subjugation is imminent. Yet, in your conversation with the Japanese vice-consul, you said, "This is still preliminary work. If the Japanese authorities can awaken and resolve the matter satisfactorily, then we can discuss it. Otherwise, the people will take second and third steps." How fast and wrong is the change in your attitude and the shift in your position? Do you think that economic severance with Japan started with the Korean people's anti-Chinese incident and will end with the resolution of the Korean people's anti-Chinese incident? Can the loss of life and property of overseas Chinese compatriots in Korea be settled with just a letter of apology and a few thousand dollars in compensation? Even if the Korean case is resolved with satisfactory conditions, can the major humiliations that Japanese imperialism has inflicted on our country in the past be forever forgotten? The blood of the May 30th Massacre has not yet reached you. You are at leisure in Shanghai and have not heard the mournful cries of the souls of the May 30th Massacre? The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee in this city has proclaimed to the world that it will permanently sever economic ties with Japan. Revolutionary people all support this proposition and strive to realize it. As the chairman of the committee, your external remarks stated that if there are satisfactory conditions, we can discuss it. Is this so-called discussion just an apology and compensation? At most, your discussion is just to sign an equal commercial treaty (as seen in your remarks). Is this so-called thorough awakening like this? We cannot help but cry. It must be understood that economic severance with Japan should start with the Japanese imperialists' aggression against our country, the awakening of our people, and end with the completion of our national revolution and the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. You should deeply understand this and correct your thinking. One. In your recent remarks to reporters, you said that the committee elected you as chairman, so you did not attend. Second, you said that the scope of economic severance is too broad and cannot be done by merchants. Third, you said that the chairman should be someone from the chairman's office of the Chamber of Commerce, because merchants are the main body of the boycott. Fourth, you said that you are a member of the Chamber of Commerce and should attend. If the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this city is just a group of merchants, then the chairman does not necessarily have to be someone from the chairman's office of the Chamber of Commerce. If the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association in this city is only attended by merchants, then it is still possible to say that the scope of economic severance is too broad. However, since the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee in this city is organized by people from all walks of life, its task is definitely not just to boycott. The main body of the committee is not any one sector that can claim it for itself. You have avoided attending because you were elected chairman, which is even more ridiculous. The complexity and confusion of your thinking is truly unfathomable. Why do you make such pompous remarks in the newspapers? You should carefully study this and correct your errors. Two. Looking back at your remarks, you said repeatedly that the boycott must be voluntary by merchants and that it should be based on conscience. Alas, it is already pathetic that the boycott requires being passive. It is even more important to encourage people to be voluntary and to regulate their conscience, as the flow of human desires is overwhelming. We do not dare to say that the education of merchants in this city is generally low and that morality is generally degenerate. However, the fact that inferior Japanese goods are selling well as soon as the anti-Japanese call rises can be used to determine that there are indeed many unscrupulous merchants in this city who are mixing and running rampant. You love merchants deeply and encourage them to be voluntary and to regulate their conscience, but what can be done if the speaker is moral but the listener is lawless? Taking Japan as an example, what is the education and morality of Japanese merchants compared to the education and morality of our country's merchants? During the period when the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee is actively inspecting goods, why do you not reflect on this and speak lightly? What will be the impact on the future of the anti-Japanese movement if you advocate voluntary boycott? Because you advocate voluntary boycott, you strongly oppose the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee's detention of goods. One is that those who operate Japanese goods suffer undeserved disasters. The other is that the procedures are too hasty. Before the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee detained the goods, did they issue a notice to those who had purchased them to register with the committee first? If there was such a notice, then it is indeed an undeserved disaster for unscrupulous merchants to secretly transport goods without registering and then have them detained. The work route of the anti-Japanese movement is indeed the correct way. All notices must be transferred through the Chamber of Commerce. Is this the first clause of Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Chamber of Commerce regulations? As the chairman of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee, you are so reckless in your remarks. It is a cause for great sigh. You should pay serious attention to this and seek immediate correction. Three. The other day, the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Department published an article entitled "Understanding and Efforts to be Made Regarding the Korean People's Anti-Chinese Incident," which stated, "Unite all oppressed peoples in the world and countries that sympathize with our country to carry out a heroic and death-defying resistance against the barbarous and arrogant Japanese imperialists." We hope that you will take advantage of this great opportunity to go to Japan, unite with the people who have expressed goodwill towards our country, and resist the barbarous and arrogant Japanese government. That would be fortunate. Even if you hire 20,000 to 30,000 people who are friendly to us, the people of our country will surely find great comfort. Alas, the misfortune of the times has already descended. Our country has the rebellion of the Red Bandits and the New Warlords in the south, and the worry of the imperialist Shi Yousan in the north. Major floods are afflicting all parts of the country. The national economy and the people's livelihood are haggard. The rural economy is collapsing. National politics are stagnating. Social order is chaotic. In the midst of encirclement and attack, we actively struggle and swear to resist. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee in this city is entrusted with the position of chairman, such as you. We hope that you will take care of it. How fortunate. We express our views frankly and hope that you will understand. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Zhou Hanmei, Ren Bin, Yao Yunbo, Zhu Shujian, Cao Huaqiu, Zhang Hanyun, Yuan Qingping, Gu Yufei, Chen Ming, Qian Yongkang, Zhu Chaoran, Zhou Lin, Zhang Hongwei, Li Bingjun, Wu Guangming, Ding Junchuan, Zhou Ziju, Lu Hongru, Tan Si'an, Han Junming, Lu Shujie, Xie Guisheng, Fei Yongzuo, Gu Mingzhai, Lu Qiutian, Lu Heng, Zhang Xiuxiong, Peng Yongjie, Xu Xiyu, Tao Shuyuan, Wei Fei, Yang Baying, Pan Ziyu, Wu Yicheng, Wu Yiheng, Xu Ziling, Kang, Zhang Tingxiang, Shen Zuoren, and seventy other citizens.</p>
<p>▲Those Who Based Their Arguments on Principles National News Agency: The Transportation Industry Association, the Merchant Guild, and the Customs Brokers Association jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Wan incident has not been resolved, and the disaster for overseas Chinese in Korea has continued. All citizens are deeply indignant, and how can we sit idly by? However, merchant groups are all under the jurisdiction of your association, and we follow your lead in everything. This time, the boycott of Japanese goods was launched in this city, but your association did not issue a detailed announcement beforehand. We have no way to follow, and we are deeply suspicious. Merchant guilds have already discovered that they have been inspected and detained by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. It was not until your association convened a members' meeting on the 24th and announced it widely that the whole city was united. We also immediately convened a meeting and announced to all guilds and members that they would voluntarily refuse to use Japanese goods and refuse to load Japanese ships. This has been made public in the newspapers and is known to all. However, according to the principle that laws do not apply retroactively, goods detained before the 24th should be returned immediately in accordance with the obligation of merchants to obey your association. This will show impartiality. Furthermore, Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Conference, has publicly declared in various newspapers that "the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce did not issue a notice beforehand, so the detained Japanese goods should be returned." His fairness and justice are sufficient to set an example for the people. Therefore, we are publicly writing to your association and requesting that you send a special letter to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Conference to return all goods detained before the 24th and register and protect them in accordance with the regulations set by your association. This will show the impartiality of the handling and strengthen the determination to boycott. We look forward to your response with great anticipation.</p>
<h3>The Entire Beijing-Shanghai Railway is Open</h3>
<p>▲Ticket Sales Resumed as Normal This Morning</p>
<p>▲However, Through Tickets for Intermodal Transport are Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Regarding the interruption of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway due to rain, after the Railway Bureau's Transportation Department dispatched foreign engineers Li Qiwei and Desifu to work with Chinese engineers Yin Zhilu and others stationed in the Beijing-Zhenjiang section to dredge and repair it, the roadbed between Beijing and Zhenjiang was repaired and reopened the morning before yesterday. The section from Zhenjiang Station to Zhenjiang South Gate Station was also repaired successively by 11 or 12 o'clock the night before last. Therefore, the northbound night express train that departed from Shanghai at 11:45 the night before last could also pass through normally at 5:45 this morning. As a result, the entire railway traffic was completely restored. However, the northbound night express train that departed from the North Station the night before last only sold passenger and freight tickets to Zhenjiang South Gate Station because the Transportation Department was not sure whether the tracks in the Zhenjiang area could be repaired on time. Ticket sales resumed as normal at 5:15 this morning. However, through tickets for Shanghai-Suzhou intermodal transport and Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin-Pukou through tickets are still temporarily suspended and will be restored after receiving notices from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and Suzhou Kunshan and other places.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Authorities Underpay Customs Revenue</h3>
<p>▲Inspector General of Customs Orders Guangdong Customs to Pay</p>
<p>National News Agency: The Inspector General of Customs stated that the customs revenue remitted to Shanghai by the Guangdong Customs has recently been only a portion of the old customs duties and is not sufficient to cover the principal and interest of various domestic and foreign debt indemnities that should be apportioned. Recently, the Customs Commissioner of Guangdong Customs was instructed to contact the Guangdong authorities and pay the amount that should be paid as scheduled. The original order is as follows: "For compliance, it is found that when the Guangdong government intercepted the customs duties of Guangdong and Guangxi, it declared that the expenses of customs collection within the territory of the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi and the foreign debts secured by customs duties, as well as the indemnities of various countries, would still be allocated as before. Although on May 30 of this year, the Guangdong government telegraphed the whole country, stating that it did not recognize the laws and regulations promulgated by the National Government after May 28. On June 15, the Guangdong Provincial Standing Committee members Tang Jun Shaoyi, Wang Jun Jingwei, Sun Jun Ke, Gu Jun Yingfen, and Xu Jun Chongzhi jointly sent a letter to various banks and the custodians of public debt funds across the country, stating that although the government did not recognize the laws and regulations issued by the National Government after May 29, the various domestic bonds issued before May 28 should still be considered valid, and all procedures should still be handled according to the usual method. According to this, the Guangdong government has already recognized that the customs duties of the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces are liable for debts incurred before May 28 and should continue to be fulfilled as before. There is no doubt about this. The number of customs revenues from the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces is calculated according to the total revenue for the entire year of 19 and from January to April of this year, accounting for approximately 11.5% of the national customs revenue. The indemnities, domestic and foreign debts, and the principal and interest payable on various treasury bills issued before May 28 that should be allocated by this Inspectorate General of Customs this year, which are secured by customs duties, total approximately US$38,204,000, which is equivalent to 95,510,000 Customs Gold Units, and domestic debt is approximately 114,677,700 silver dollars. Therefore, the 11.5% of the amount that should be borne by the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces each month is approximately 915,000 Customs Gold Units and 1,100,000 silver dollars. Currently, it is found that since June 11 of this year, after the Guangdong authorities intercepted the customs duties, the customs revenue remitted to Shanghai by the Guangdong Customs has only been a portion of the old customs duties. The newly added and additional tax portions have all been intercepted. Therefore, for the month of June, the customs duties remitted by the various customs offices in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces for various debt indemnities only amounted to 1,103,846 yuan. Furthermore, for the month of July, as of July 15, only 196,123 yuan of customs revenue has been remitted. The customs revenues remitted by the various customs offices in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces are not sufficient to cover the principal and interest of various debt indemnities that should be paid. Therefore, you, the Customs Commissioner, are ordered to immediately contact the Guangdong authorities in writing in accordance with the above-mentioned intention and urge them to immediately make up for the previously underpaid customs revenues and to ensure that the amount that should be paid is paid in full in the future without delay. You are still ordered to report the reasons for the previously short-paid customs revenues and the results of the contact in detail by telegram. This order," etc.</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony Held at the Local Self-Government Training Institute Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Local Self-Government Training Institute, attached to the Shanghai Municipal Government, which was established in December of last year, its first class of students has completed its three-month training and three-month internship. Yesterday morning at 10:00, the Municipal Government held a graduation ceremony at the Diplomatic Ministry's Shanghai Office Building. Mayor Zhang, Director Yu (Secretary-General Yu), Deputy Director Ji Zongxing, Municipal Government Counselor Sun Baorong, Secretaries Guo, Geng Jiaji, Tang Tuxuan, etc., all teaching staff of the training institute, special class students, ordinary class students, about 200 people, attended. The venue was simply and solemnly decorated. During the ceremony, Director Yu presided over the meeting. First, the chairman made a political speech, which was divided into three points: (1) the course of training students at this institute; (2) the feelings that students should have upon graduation; (3) the beginning of graduates serving the community. Finally, he encouraged all students to continue their studies after graduation. The words were sincere and encouraging. Then, Mayor Zhang gave a speech. After that, Mayor Zhang personally presented graduation certificates. A total of seventy-six ordinary class graduates and one hundred and five special class graduates received certificates. Everyone applauded when each student received their certificate. After the certificates were distributed, they took a group photo to commemorate the occasion and then dispersed.</p>
<h3>Talk by Dr. Xie Shou Kang</h3>
<p>Dr. Xie Shou Kang, the Chargé d'affaires in Belgium, returned to China on the 10th of this month,</p>
<p>as previously reported. Now that Mr. Xie has come to Shanghai for business, a reporter visited him at the residence of Mr. Shao Goumei and recorded his remarks as follows: (Question) What is the situation of the overseas Chinese in Belgium? (Answer) There are about six hundred Chinese in Belgium, half of whom are students and half of whom are sailors. (Question) What kind of academic subjects do students in Belgium mostly study? (Answer) Belgium is an industrial country, and most of the Chinese students in Belgium study industry. Recently, some have also studied fine arts, and most of them are diligent and have excellent grades. (Question) What is the situation of the sailors? (Answer) The so-called sailors refer to the Chinese laborers engaged in navigation. They do not come and go regularly, but because of their large number, there are often about three hundred people in Antwerp (Anevss), a major port in Belgium. (Question) It is said that the unemployment problem in Europe is serious. Are these overseas Chinese affected? (Answer) The unemployment problem is a widespread problem, and sailors in Belgium are no exception. Therefore, I reported the details to the central government last year. The central government cared about the overseas Chinese and sent funds for relief. However, the situation is gradually easing now. Some of our country's sailors have changed their occupation to bricklayers, and their monthly wages can reach two hundred yuan. (Question) During your year abroad, you spared no effort in promoting the new atmosphere of China and its ancient culture. The European newspapers praised you unanimously on that day, but only a glimpse of it has been seen in the Chinese newspapers. Can we hear more about the details? (Answer) I feel that I am superficial and dare not say that I have achieved any great results. However, when I was in Belgium, I</p>

<p>never closed myself off from any activities that I should participate in. As for the lectures invited by various cultural institutions in France and Germany, such as the Paris Chamber of Deputies, the China-France Friendship Group, the French National Broadcasting Radio Station, the International Cultural Cooperation Society, and the International Friendship Association, as well as the University of Frankfurt in Germany, I took the opportunity to promote our country, which seems to be what I should do. (Question) What works have you published in recent years? (Answer) I was very busy with official duties in Belgium, and my personal work was suspended. However, the "Belgium Bookstore" asked to compile and publish my lectures and essays from various places, titled E st Ouest R eflets Croises, and received long prefaces from the Belgian Foreign Minister Paul Homans (which seems to have been translated and published in Chinese newspapers) and the Belgian literary figure Vanzypl. It will be published in October of this year. (Question) How was Xu Beihong's exhibition in Brussels? (Answer) Xu's works already have a considerable status in Europe, and many people in the art world know about him. Therefore, this exhibition was particularly successful. The Minister of Education personally attended the opening ceremony, and the Queen of Belgium inquired about the artist's life when she visited the exhibition. It is still a groundbreaking achievement for Chinese artists to have such success abroad. (Question) What are your thoughts on returning to China? Disaster is striking China's survival and is striking the world's civilization. The situation is serious, and the whole country should work together to eliminate it and win back our true freedom to achieve the goal of the revolution.</p>
<h3>Dr. Wu Lien-teh's Talk After Returning to China</h3>
<p>▲ The Situation of Attending the International Three Important Meetings</p>
<p>▲ Optimism for the Future of Epidemic Prevention</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Lien-teh, Director of the National Seaport Epidemic Prevention Office of the Ministry of Health, has returned to China after completing his mission of attending the three important meetings of the Health Administration and Narcotics of the League of Nations in Europe. He arrived in Shanghai at about 5 pm the day before yesterday. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency paid a special visit yesterday. The following is a record of his remarks regarding the situation of attending the three important international conferences.</p>
<p>▲ Health Committee Wu said that he left the country on April 11, went to Europe via Siberia, and arrived in Geneva on the 27th to attend the Health Committee of the League of Nations, the 63rd International Administrative Conference, and the most important World Narcotics Conference. The Health Committee only reported on the progress of health in our country and the annual expenses of our government on health matters. In the past, the annual expenses on health matters in our country were only more than one million yuan, but recently it has increased to more than three million yuan, which shows the gradual progress of health affairs in our country.</p>
<p>▲ Sending Personnel to China The 63rd International Administrative Conference of the League of Nations was held in Geneva on May 17. There were a total of 14 attendees, including the foreign ministers of various countries. I attended as a representative of Finance Minister Song Ziwen, requesting that they send commissioners to China to assist our country in the three tasks of finance, transportation, and education in an advisory capacity and nature. The League of Nations has now agreed and will send them to China in three groups. Each group will have about three people. The first group will send an education commissioner first, who is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on September 1. The commissioners of the finance and transportation groups have not yet been determined, but it is expected that they will be decided soon and will come to China immediately.</p>
<p>▲ Narcotics At the International Narcotics Conference, which began on May 17 and ended on July 13, there were a large number of representatives from various countries, a total of 54 countries. The most vigorous discussions at the meeting were on narcotics such as heroin. Representatives from various countries considered that this kind of narcotic substance originated in the six countries of Britain, the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and that China, India, and Egypt were the main countries suffering from its harm. Therefore, I proposed to ban the manufacture of heroin in various countries. At the same time, representatives from Japan, the Soviet Union, and other countries also opposed the manufacture and sale of heroin by the six countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Germany. As a result, due to the many uses in the medical and chemical industries, the complete ban was not passed, but the manufacture limited to the use of the medical and chemical industries was passed, and 28 countries signed the resolution not to manufacture it for any purpose other than medical and chemical uses.</p>
<p>▲ Opium Conference Because the discussion on opium narcotics is more related to the East, it was decided to hold the World Opium Conference in Siam on November 7. At that time, I am afraid that I will not be able to attend, or the government will send another representative to participate.</p>
<p>▲ Epidemic Prevention Situation Wu said at the end that when he returned to China from Marseille, he observed the commercial situation of various countries along the way in France, Italy, India, Singapore, the Philippines, and Hong Kong, which was extremely bleak. After arriving in China, he also inspected the epidemic prevention situation of the southern seaports of our country in Shantou, Xiamen, etc., which was very good. Since our country took back the epidemic prevention work from the hands of foreigners and ran it ourselves, there has been rapid progress. Now that this work has only been taken back for six months, there are facilities such as institutes. There was no such achievement in the hands of foreigners for several years, which shows that if our country does not seek progress in everything, it is easy to seek progress.</p>
<h3>Wusong Water Police Fourth District Ordered to Investigate and Prohibit Rice Export</h3>
<p>Jiang Chao Xiong, the chief of the fourth district of the Wusong Maritime Provincial Public Security Team of Jiangsu, received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs of the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, stating that the smuggling of rice out of the province has been strictly prohibited on record. This year's moldy rain has been continuous, and the famine has become apparent. Now is the time when the new and old crops are not yet available, and the market price is rising daily. The ban should be reiterated to maintain the people's food supply. He ordered to supervise and strictly investigate and prohibit any negligence. After receiving the order, District Chief Jiang considered that Wusong Port is an important gateway to the rivers and seas, and there may be unscrupulous merchants smuggling rice for export. He has ordered Zhang Zongliang, the captain of the Sixteenth Team, Gong Mianqin, the captain of the Seventeenth Team, and Xie Ze Zhi, the captain of the Eighteenth Team, to add patrol boats from now on, to distribute them outside the port and at the key routes of the boat companies, and to strictly investigate and arrest.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Orders Should Be Registered Immediately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Grain, Oilcake, and Allied Trades Association issued a public notice to all members yesterday, stating that it had recently received an instruction from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that a new wheat crop has been launched on the market, and it is said that merchants are still ordering foreign wheat, which not only causes prices to fall, but also causes the pain of having nothing to sell. It must be known that purchasing foreign goods was originally a remedy for when the local products were insufficient. Now that local wheat is available, there is no need to seek foreign supplies. If the industry believes that domestic wheat has not been strictly inspected and the goods are mixed and unclean, it can try to rectify it and request government assistance. How can it be abandoned because of choking, and not consider the farmers and domestic products? The merchants of the industry have always known the big picture and should jointly plan to maintain domestic wheat production and rectification and improvement methods, so that farmers and merchants can benefit from both. In addition to issuing separate orders, it is hereby ordered that you comply with the instructions and urge the industry to register the foreign wheat that has been ordered with the Bureau as soon as possible, which is of utmost importance. This order, etc. Upon receipt of this, it should be recorded and instructed, and it is hoped that all members of the industry will be informed and strictly implement it. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3>The Initiation of the China Law Society</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the China Law Society sent a public letter to all levels of courts across the country, bar associations in various provinces, and law schools yesterday, stating that the Chinese legal system is one of the five major legal systems in the world, with deep roots and flourishing branches. In addition to the Chinese nation, those who are subject to its control include Korea, Japan, Annam, and even Myanmar, Siam, and the South Seas Islands, all of which are directly and indirectly blessed by it. Its historical glory is long-standing, and it is unparalleled in the world's legal systems. Only because of environmental changes, legal practitioners often ignore the spirit of the evolution of the times, stick to conventions, and allow the power of this great legal system to wither day by day. Since the revolution, people from all walks of life have vigorously reversed the past, only respecting imported legal studies, and thus allowing hundreds of millions of Chinese people to be completely immersed in imported legal systems. Although the world is becoming more and more unified, promoting the inherent spirit of the nation is something that the entire nation should have. Now, in the context of the establishment of the country based on the Three Principles of the People, the sorting out and creation of new and old laws in the country, and the comparative analysis of academic theories abroad, all the more need legal scholars to conduct in-depth research before they can be of help. In recent years, the China Engineering Society and the China Economic Society have gathered experts together, and they have been able to provide significant contributions in academics. At this time of the succession of the new and the old, how dare the people in our legal field underestimate ourselves? Therefore, we are uniting with comrades to initiate the organization of the China Law Society, intending to gather judges, lawyers, professors of law, politics, and other subjects, and students of law and political science who have graduated from all over the country, to do their best according to their knowledge and abilities, and according to their positions, to conduct deeper research on various laws and regulations of the past, present, and foreign countries, in order to promote the Chinese legal system, and to integrate it with the major legal systems of the world, and thereby to promote the highest laws that adapt to our country's nation-building ideology and suit the common life of our nation. However, this matter is of great importance, and it cannot be achieved without the combined efforts of all the wise men. We have long admired your court, association, and school for your in-depth study of law and outstanding reputation. If you are willing to join the initiative, then one call will be followed by a hundred responses. The prosperity of law is deeply relied upon. If you agree, please reply immediately. We look forward to it in anticipation. We are in haste to inform you and wish you a peaceful summer. To so and so, Zhang Yaozeng, Chu Fucheng, Wang Youling, Wan Zhaozhi, Liu Lushi, Wu Jingxiong, Chen Zemin, Guo Wei, Xu Jiashi, Dai Xiuzan, Qin Liankui, Tan Yigong, Li Shirui, Liu Zuwang, Liu Tuxiong, Shen Junru, Lu Dingkui, Yu Zhongluo, Lu Shaozong, Zhao Zuwei, Jiang Yiping, Wu Chengyu, Zhang Zhirang, Zhao Chen, Pan Zhenya, Sheng Zhenwei, Wang Zhenshen, Yang Binbin, Cai Nipei, Zhang Enhua, Shan Yuhua, Zhong Hongsheng, Huang Han, Wu Zhiping, Zhang Zhengxue, Zhang Feixiong, Zhou Shiyun, and others.</p>
<h3>Tea Industry Petitions for the Cancellation of Inspection</h3>
<p>The foreign trade tea industry has always been divided into two groups, red and green. Recently, in opposition to the inspection of foreign trade tea leaves by the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, more than 100 representatives of the two groups were convened on the 25th of this month to express the obstacles to the inspection of foreign trade tea leaves, and it was decided to recommend Zheng Erzang, Zheng Ziyu, He Jiepu, Wang Jinyi, Hu Youqing, Wang Sifu, Hu Songpu, and other seven people to jointly petition the Inspection Bureau with the standing committee members of the Tea Industry Association, requesting the cancellation of the inspection. Yesterday, the representatives drafted a presentation and took it to the Inspection Bureau to petition.</p>
<h3>Introducing the "Northeast Yearbook"</h3>
<p>The Northeast Yearbook published by the Northeast Cultural Society is richly collected. The organizer spent years and years of time, borrowed the power of the political, military, academic, and commercial circles of the four provinces, and referred to hundreds of specialized writings. It also carefully edited and arranged based on detailed tables from various sources, indicating the source. Only then could this grand view be achieved, fully revealing the far-reaching progress of various political and social phenomena in the Northeast in recent years within this small compilation. It is truly a book that those who study the Northeast issue cannot be without.</p>
<h3>Customs Auctions Should Be Handed Over to Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>▲ Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Jianghai Customs Administration</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Supervisor's Office yesterday regarding the matter of customs auctions being exclusively handed over to Chinese merchants, stating that the letter from the Chinese Yizhong Auction House, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, received on the 25th of this month, stated that the auction industry is impartial and has the nature of arbitration, which is different from ordinary commercial organizations. Therefore, its business has strict regulations. In the past, Chinese merchants did not know how to organize, so foreign merchants invaded. Not only were the rights and interests lost, but also the national dignity was tarnished. The members established the Chinese Yizhong Auction House in 1927 and immediately submitted applications to the Shanghai Political Branch, the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural and Industrial Chamber of Commerce, the National Registration Bureau, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the various levels of courts. The former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce approved the establishment and distributed protection and promotion, which are all on file. The members' acquisition of auction qualifications is purely legal. Later, the members were invited by the various levels of courts as appraisers and by various commercial organizations as notaries public, and the procedures were handled in an orderly manner. However, the Jianghai Customs Office has always rotated the auction of goods from Lu Yisimo Foreign Firm and Ruihe Foreign Firm. After the establishment of the Shanghai Provisional Court, the members requested the Customs to join the auction rotation, following the example of the Court's auction rotation, and jointly participated in the handling with the two foreign firms. Later, the Provisional Court was changed to the Special Zone Court. All civil appraisal and valuation affairs were handled by Chinese merchants, and foreign merchants did not participate, which was intended to safeguard legal rights and consolidate the national system. Now that legal rights have been recovered, all businesses related to national sovereignty should be handled by Chinese people themselves. The Customs should take back its autonomy and, for the business of auctioning confiscated goods, should designate Chinese merchants to handle it exclusively and no longer allow foreign merchants to be mixed in, dividing the sovereignty. Therefore, a special letter is prepared and submitted to your office for forwarding to the Jianghai Customs, requesting that the foreign merchant's auction rotation be immediately cancelled and handled exclusively by the legal Chinese auction house in order to maintain the national system and protect sovereignty. After investigation, the Customs is a national administrative agency, and although it handles tax collection and other matters, it has more contact with foreign merchants, which is the same as the Special Zone's acceptance of Chinese and foreign lawsuits. Since the Shanghai Provisional Court was reorganized into the Special Zone Court, all the old precedents of the former Chinese and foreign merchants' auction rotation have been abandoned and changed to the Chinese Yizhong Auction House's exclusive undertaking, which has been implemented for a long time and has not been hindered. Then, the Customs should follow the example of the Special Zone Court for auctioning confiscated items and change it to the exclusive handling by Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>Undertaking, there is no so-called conflict. Maintaining domestic chambers of commerce is a common policy of any country, and national institutions must be able to implement it effectively in order to achieve the effect of speaking and acting. A letter is hereby prepared and submitted, and it is hoped that your office will consult with the tax division and promptly implement it in order to establish public friendship.</p>
<h3>Judicial Yuan Interprets Article 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law</h3>
<p>▲ The Law is Based on the Recognition of the Central Training Department</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a telegram from the Judicial Yuan yesterday, stating that the telegram from Qiaodai and the deletion telegram from the Wusong Chamber of Commerce are both known. After investigating the provisions of Article 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, but in prosperous areas and towns, chambers of commerce may also be established separately or jointly. The so-called "may be established" does not mean that they must be established. Since the Wusong Chamber of Commerce has been deemed by the Central Training Department in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law to not need to be established separately, there is no need to explain it further. Inform them by telegram and ask them to forward it to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. Sincerely printed by the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Stops Selling Moganshan Joint Tickets</h3>
<p>▲ Due to Rain and Flooding of the Roadbed</p>

<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Adds Tianfu'an Station</h3>
<p>▲ Passenger Cars Will Stop on the 10th of Next Month</p>

It is now known that the construction of the station has been completed and will begin operations on August 10, stopping passenger cars.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Gan Zhen Association Continues to Urge Zhen Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Jiangxi Emergency Relief Association received a letter from Commander Xiong in Nanchang to the Presidium yesterday, stating that Jun Wei and Wu visited Gan and learned about the situation. Then, the letter from the Association on July 18 was displayed, along with the resolutions attached. I sincerely thank you for your enthusiasm. Regarding the unified tax treasury bills, they are now available on the market. I still hope that you will make efforts to encourage fundraising. The matter concerns good deeds. Even if there is a small discount, it is thought that good people will not care about it. If the cash that has been pledged is to be remitted, please send it to the Nanchang Local Relief Office as soon as possible. Because of the recent military progress, the disaster area has expanded. Methods for planning emergency relief, industrial relief, and agricultural relief have been slightly scaled. As soon as the funds are remitted, they can be processed immediately. However, the disaster is serious and the disaster area is vast. The funds currently raised are still a drop in the bucket. It is truly said that there are many victims and few relief funds. I don't know how to handle it. I still hope that you will continue to do this and intensify fundraising. Then, the victims in Jiangxi Province will not only offer incense and prayers. All other information has been entrusted to Jun Wei and Wu to convey separately. Currently, in addition to the 200,000 yuan of relief funds that have been remitted, fundraising has been intensified in order to save this disaster.</p>
<h3>Caojing District to Open Medical Relief Bureau with a Deadline</h3>
<p>Yang Xinzheng, the Municipal Committee Member of Caohejing Town in Western Shanghai, has established a medical relief bureau and has commissioned Mr. Yang Yongdi to plan and arrange everything. It is scheduled to start the diagnosis on August 1 at the headquarters of the Guard Corps.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants Hospital is About to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Merchants Hospital in this port is run by the Guangdong people in Shanghai, but the management has not been good in the past, so there has not been much achievement. Later, Dr. Chen Daming advocated reorganization in order to benefit the fellow villagers. The hospital only then had the intention of reorganization. However, the person in charge of the hospital was unable to hold a meeting to discuss and decide due to busy business affairs, so the reorganization process was slightly suspended. Recently, Dr. Chen Daming still believes that the hospital needs to be reorganized and developed, and Dr. Huang will contact the head of the hospital again to plan. The board of directors then passed the resolution, and several doctors, including Chen and Huang, will take charge of medical affairs, and will formally take over during the day. It is heard that Dr. Chen and Dr. Huang are all graduates of famous medical schools in Europe and the United States, and their knowledge and experience are very rich. Chen Junbingqian and others, Guangdong merchants in Shanghai, expressed great sympathy.</p>
<h3>Wusong Electricity Went Out Last Morning</h3>
<p>At about 2:40 am yesterday, the lights in the Wusong area suddenly went out completely, turning into a dark world. After about an hour, it began to light up again, and then it flickered on and off for about half an hour before it returned to normal. Fortunately, the sky was not bright when the lights went out, and the residents were all asleep. It happened to be raining, so there were no pedestrians on the road. Except for the Seventh District Public Security Police, who patrolled the area with a little more attention, there were no other actions. It was learned that the current used by the Wusong Baoming Electric Company is completely fed by the Yinhang Hydropower Plant. The company does not generate electricity. Yesterday, it was due to the damage to the machinery of the Hydropower Plant. It has now been completely repaired.</p>
<h3>Chen Zonghan's Report on Attending the U.S. National Electric Light Association Convention</h3>
<p>The U.S. National Electric Light Association held its 54th annual convention in Atlantic City from June 8th to 12th of this year.  The Chinese National Private Electric Industry Association was invited to send representatives.  Due to the short notice, Mr. Chen Zonghan, an electrical engineering expert residing in the United States, was immediately telegraphed to attend. This has been reported in this newspaper.  It is now known that after the convention, Mr. Chen sent a detailed report to the Shanghai office of the National Private Electric Industry Association. The report includes the following three items: (1) A brief history and organization of the Association. The Association was founded in 1885 and has a history of 46 years.  Membership is divided into nine categories.  The headquarters has a President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. The National Executive Committee is the highest governing body.  Below that are Special and General Committees, and several sections. Currently, there are four sections: Planning, Commercial, Engineering, and Public Relations. Each section has a committee and several subcommittees. Provincial branches are established in each province, and several provincial branches form a district branch.  The forty-eight states of the United States are divided into twelve districts, plus one district in Canada, for a total of thirteen districts. Nine sub-branches are established.  A company or town with more than ten members can establish a branch. (2) The Association's affairs. The Association's purpose is to promote the science and technology of electricity generation, distribution, and application. All its activities are purely educational and research-oriented. The duties of the committees and sections are defined by the National Executive Committee based on their nature and scope. For external activities, the President appoints representatives to participate. The working reports of various academic organizations, government and other industrial research opportunities, international electric industry organizations and committees, and various sections are printed as separate publications from time to time, and compiled into annual convention proceedings.  In addition, a monthly association publication is issued, and several specialized reference books on electricity meters, wiring fees, etc., are compiled. (3) The situation of this year's convention and electrical appliance exposition. The convention lasted four and a half days. The first day was for the executive committee meetings of each section. The remaining three and a half days were for four general assembly meetings. The Planning, Commercial, Engineering, Public Relations sections, as well as the Public Policy Committee and the Women's Committee, each held one meeting. The fourth day was designated as Edison Day to honor the inventor Edison. At each meeting, in addition to short reports from the committees or sections, there were speeches by guests or members. At the last general assembly, awards were presented and the next term's officers were elected. The topics of the speeches were mostly focused on the two most urgent issues of the moment: one was the causes and remedies for the economic depression of the past two years, and the other was the issue of public versus private ownership of the electric industry. The exposition and the convention coincided, with more than 200 participating manufacturing companies displaying a wide variety of household electrical appliances. It is said that the report will be published in full in Volume 2, Issue 1 of the Electrical Industry Quarterly. Those interested in the electric industry should read it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>News from District Branches of the City Federation</h3>

(A) A report on the purpose of the meeting. (B) Discussion of (1) The City Federation's emergency notification to members regarding the case of a member detained by Japanese police at the police station.

<p>▲ 15th District Branch: The 15th District Branch of the City Federation sent a letter to the Public Works Department regarding the relocation of the night soil depot, stating: "To the esteemed director, We have received a letter from members Dechang, Ruikang, and Tairui, stating that they reside on the North Suzhou Road near the Old Zha Gate Bridge, at numbers 596 to 599. In recent years, their businesses have flourished, and there is a significant amount of people coming and going. Unclean areas should be demolished to improve sanitation. However, the Public Works Department has a night soil depot in this area, which is detrimental to sanitation. From morning to night, a foul odor permeates the air, causing nausea. Passersby cannot help but cover their noses. Our businesses are nearby and suffer from this offensive smell, which is difficult to bear. We had initially intended to petition your department to negotiate with the Public Works Department to relocate it to another location, or to merge it with the sparsely populated Sikh Temple depot. However, we heard that the Public Works Department had already proposed relocating it, so we temporarily suspended our efforts. We request that your department and our members negotiate to have it relocated within a specified time to maintain our businesses and improve the city's appearance. Accordingly, we find that the Suzhou Road area near the depot is a vital transportation route and a central commercial hub. As businesses are located within the concession, municipal regulations prioritize cleanliness for business operations. The night soil depot, with its foul odor, not only affects commerce but also obstructs traffic. The municipal authorities should pay attention to this. We request that your department instruct the sanitation department to relocate it to the west of the Old Garbage Bridge or another location as soon as possible, to benefit commerce and facilitate transportation. With deepest respect, [addressed to] the Director General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement."</p>

<h3>Preparations for Miss Gordon's Memorial Service</h3>

<h3>Ford Automobiles Dominate Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to recent reports from the British and French Public Works Departments, there are a total of 9,865 registered automobiles in Shanghai. Ford accounts for 1,093 vehicles, ranking first. In addition to the leadership's passenger cars, the number of Ford trucks has increased to 743. It is noted that the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council has about 200 official vehicles, all of which are Fords, and since they are free, they are not included in the total number. Another notable feature is that almost all of the armored vehicles used by banks to transport silver are Fords. Major banks have already ordered nearly 20 vehicles, and many more are under consideration.</p>

<h3>An Innocent Person Sacrificed in the Assassination Attempt</h3>
<p>▲ Zhang Agen Struck by a Stray Bullet</p>
<p>▲ Succumbs to Injuries Yesterday</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd of this month, a violent assassination attempt on the Minister of Finance of the National Government, Mr. Song Ziwen, occurred at the North Railway Station. The exchange of gunfire between Mr. Song's bodyguards and the assassins, and the resulting injuries to multiple people, have been reported in detail in this newspaper. Zhang Agen, a 54-year-old man from Suzhou, who made a living selling second-hand goods and lived at No. 672 Xiangxin Lane, Mou Su Road, went to the North Station at 7:07 AM that morning to purchase a train ticket to Suzhou. While he was buying the ticket, he suddenly heard the sounds of bombs and guns and turned to flee. Unfortunately, he was caught in the crossfire and struck by a bullet in the waist. He immediately collapsed to the ground. A police officer noticed him and immediately had him transported to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries and his advanced age, he could not be saved. He died at 8:10 PM on the 25th. His body was transported by police car to the Philen Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the Special District Court arrived at the morgue and confirmed that the body had been killed by a stray bullet. He then took his seat in the courtroom and inquired about the facts. Later, the deceased's son-in-law, Zhang Boying, filed a case, requesting the release of the body. Mr. Guo then ordered that Zhang Agen's body be released to his son-in-law for burial.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Tan Yigong Raises Objections to the Sudden Conversion to Private Sale of Huang Chu Jiu's Estate</h3>
<p>A letter from lawyer Tan Yigong states: "Regarding the liquidation of Gongfa Company and the Huang Chu Jiu family's assets, the sudden change from public auction to private sale has a significant impact on the interests of creditors and the Huang family. I have already, on behalf of the Huang family, filed an objection with the French Concession Court, along with a legal opinion. The details of this process are of interest to those concerned about this matter and general creditors. I am sending the original objection and opinion to your newspaper for appropriate publication for public viewing." The statement of objection is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Statement of Objection: Regarding the liquidation of the Huang Chu Jiu estate and debts, on July 18th of this year, Your Court issued an order stating that the auction method had encountered difficulties, and the creditor representatives were also eager to expedite the conclusion of the matter for the benefit of the creditors. They applied for a change of method, continuing to use the private sale method. The two auctions were both rescinded. The liquidator should seek to sell the assets at the highest bid price. Any further discussion is unnecessary. Upon reading this order, the applicant was shocked and astonished. Your Court's order was based on the report of Gongfa Company liquidators Wu Cheng and Pan Zhaobang, both accountants, dated July 17th, and the on-court application of Jiang Yiping and other lawyers representing the creditors of Gongfa Company. The accountants' report and the lawyers' request both infringe upon rights and violate the law. The applicant cannot acknowledge them. Therefore, an objection is hereby filed in accordance with the law, with the following details: (1) Objections to the report of accountants Wu Cheng and Pan Zhaobang: This case of liquidating the Huang Chu Jiu estate and debts was submitted to Your Court for approval, and liquidators Wu and Pan of Gongfa Company were appointed to work with the applicant to properly devise a plan and report it for verification and decision. The accountants were in a supervisory and liquidating position, which is very clear. Previously, the shops exclusively owned by Huang Chu Jiu were all handled and negotiated by the accountants, and the sales contracts were drafted by the accountants and only sent to the applicant for countersignature and stamping (as evidenced by previous correspondence). The applicant acted with fairness, seeking to expedite the process as long as it benefited the creditors and did not harm the debtors. The applicant always expressed agreement and was unwilling to argue over jurisdiction. However, the accountants regarded the applicant as someone easy to deal with. When they first published the advertisement for the auction of Huang's movable and immovable property, they did not inform the applicant and published the advertisement solely in the name of the liquidators of Gongfa Company. The applicant specifically questioned them in a letter due to their responsibility. Only then did they jointly publish the announcement (as evidenced by various newspapers). After the bidding opened on July 8th, the parties reviewed the bids together and agreed that all the bids were valid except for the West Warehouse Road property, which was valued too low (as evidenced by the joint signed review form). They should have separately notified the bidders to expedite the transaction. The applicant was proceeding in accordance with the law and there was nothing improper. The accountants initially urged the applicant to issue letters of notification but did not notify the bidders themselves. Now, they are blaming the applicant as one of the obstacles, which is incomprehensible. Also, July 16th was the first day of bidding. The day before, someone came to the applicant's office and informed the applicant's staff that the accounting firm was not issuing bid forms or accepting security deposits. Although the person's address was unknown and it was difficult to investigate, on the morning of the bidding, the applicant received a phone call from a bidder who said that the accounting firm's staff claimed that the accountant would not arrive until 12:00 noon and refused to issue bid forms or accept security deposits, leading to a dispute. The applicant, for the sake of the overall situation, telegraphed the accounting firm's staff to accompany the bidders to the applicant's office to handle the matter. The accounting firm's staff member Zhang Xing accompanied bidders Ding Qihong, Ge Jisheng, and Miao Hongchang. They stated that the accountant had indeed not arrived. The applicant issued bid forms and collected security deposits on behalf of the accountant, and Zhang Xing signed the temporary receipt to acknowledge the seriousness of the matter. The facts are clear and cannot be denied. The applicant sent a letter to the accountant on the same day proposing four measures, which was a necessary step at the time. The report stated, "If someone came to pay a security deposit, how could no one have heard in a small room?" This statement is somewhat embellished. As for whether the accountants worked more than ten hours a day, it is not something the applicant should inquire about. However, the accountants did not arrive before 11:00 AM that morning, as admitted by the firm's staff member Zhang Xing. The applicant, for the sake of the overall situation and friendship, offered sincere advice with the four measures and did not have ulterior motives. However, the accountants also cited this as an obstacle, which is a misunderstanding. The accountants had long harbored the intention to dispose of Huang's estate alone and did not hesitate to violate the court order, submitting a unilateral presentation to overturn the public auction and monopolize power. This resulted in Your Court's order to rescind the auction and seek a private sale. Public auctions are a transparent method, while private sales inevitably involve secrecy. Take the private sale of the Great World as an example. The Great World was the only valuable asset in Gongfa Company's assets. The lawyers representing the various creditors and the accountants had previously discussed a minimum auction price of 1.25 million, which was published in the newspapers. However, the result was that it was not publicly bid on, nor was it advertised for competitive sale. Instead, through a mysterious private sale method, a buyer was obtained who would pay 700,000 in installments, which was more than 550,000 less than the original minimum price, which is shocking. Regarding this point, the Huang family, as shareholders of Gongfa Company, should reserve the right to assert their legal rights in the future. However, the applicant, lacking the direct authority to interfere with Gongfa Company's liquidation affairs, has no power to make the claim and can only watch helplessly. It is strange that the lawyers representing the creditors, who are supposed to protect the creditors' interests, are actively interfering with the sale of Huang's estate but are indifferent to the sale of Gongfa Company's assets. The reason for this is worth pondering deeply. This private sale method is sufficient to cause external criticism and disputes between creditors and debtors, which is obvious. Although the applicant is foolish, he is unwilling to sell Huang's assets in his own area of responsibility and have the same phenomenon as the Great World occur. He will say everything he knows and say it to the fullest extent. Therefore, for the two auctions, he believes that the assets that have been reviewed and confirmed and for which the successful bidders have been notified should still be accepted by those bidders who pay the price and accept the assets to preserve credibility. For the assets that have not been reviewed and confirmed or have not been bid on, he believes that the methods of advertising for competitive sale or public auction should be used (the methods are detailed in the attached opinion letter). This would be sufficient to demonstrate impartiality, avoid private corruption, and ensure speed and avoid losses. Furthermore, this property is Huang Chu Jiu's personal property, which was approved for the liquidation of personal debts from the estate, not Gongfa Company's assets. According to the court order of March 30th, the responsibility for disposal and debt repayment naturally falls on the agent of the Huang family. This court order still has the liquidator seek to sell the assets, as if referring to Huang's family's liquidator. The applicant should be responsible for it. As if referring to the liquidator of Gongfa Company, it seems difficult for the liquidator of Gongfa Company to be responsible for the property that Gongfa Company does not own. Based on the interpretation of the word "still", it still agrees with the court's intent on March 30th, which is clear. In short, since the court order of March 30th has not expired, the accountant acted against the court order of March 30th with an independent behavior. If it is not an intentional encroachment on the duties of others, but a mistaken idea that the liquidator of Gongfa Company and the liquidator of Huang's family are the same (the rights and duties are detailed in the attached opinion), this is particularly confusing to the applicant. (2) Objection to the statement of lawyer Jiang Yiping representing the creditors of Gongfa Company: The liquidation in this case is of Huang Chu Jiu's estate and debts, as clearly indicated in Your Court's order of March 30th. Gongfa Company's position in this case is merely as one of the ordinary creditors. As for Gongfa Company's creditors, they have no direct creditor-debtor relationship with Huang (detailed reasons are in the attached opinion). According to the law, there is absolutely no room for interference. However, the lawyers dared to violate the law and infringe upon rights. Unless there is a different intention, why would they do this? Based on the above, and with the attached legal opinion, it is requested that Your Court approve the approval of the successful bidders who have been audited and confirmed and conduct public competitive bidding or public auction, to demonstrate fairness and prevent private corruption. This is for the public benefit. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Contributed to the Hometown</h3>
<p>▲ Intolerable to the Bandit Party</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Jinmao Died Tragically</p>
<p>A few days ago, multiple households were robbed by bandits in Wan Dou area, Gaoqiao Town, Pudong. In order to ensure the safety of the community, the 4th Section of the 5th District, due to the generous reward for capturing the bandit party, employed the local bailiff Shen Guanlin and the civilian Zhang Jinmao to assist in the investigation. They discovered that Ni Erlang, Zhu Jinhua, and Jin Fa, from Chongming, were indeed part of the bandit gang. They reported this to the police, who arrested and handed them over to the authorities. Although this contributed to the safety of the community, the bandit party held a grudge. A few days ago, Zhang Jinmao suddenly disappeared. Two days later, a foot was seen sticking out of the water near the Xiaoshi Bridge. The local bailiff Shen Guanlin went to investigate and saw that the trousers were made of Yunsha material. He pulled the body out of the water and found three large stones pressing on it. After removing the stones, he pulled the body out and recognized it as Zhang Jinmao's body. He notified Zhang Jinmao's father, Zhang Shaoyun, who mourned greatly at the scene. Yesterday, he filed a complaint with the local court, stating that he had been killed by the bandit party out of revenge and requesting justice. The local court dispatched Prosecutor Wu and the coroner to the scene. The coroner found that the corpse's eyes had been blinded with lime, there were knife wounds on the waist, and blood was coming out of the mouth. It was confirmed that the death was due to injuries. Photos were taken and the body was ordered to be collected for burial pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>龔咸囡黨徒宋阿百陳木泉迎提歸案</h3>
<p>Nanhui's notorious bandit Gong Xiannü and his gang members Song Abai, Zhu Danggen (Zhu Mengnan), Chen Muquan (Gong Jingen), etc., were captured by the French Concession police last month. They confessed to robbing Jin's family, a wealthy household in Shanghai, and were detained. The Nanhui authorities learned of this and ordered the Zhuqiao Security Corps to cooperate with the Fifth Public Security Bureau to retrieve the prisoners from the French Concession jail. After several negotiations, on July 19th, they extradited Song Abai, Chen Muquan, and Song Quanfu (six others had already been sent to Nanhui by the police for interrogation). Wang, a patrol officer from the Fifth Public Security Bureau, took them back. During interrogation, they confessed to the robberies. The following is a record of their confessions:</p>
<p>Song Abai confessed: I am twenty-eight years old and from the second Jia of the fifth Tuan. The Xue Haichun family robbery was orchestrated by Gong Xiannü. On the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month, Gong Xiannü initiated the plan and discussed the robbery with Chen Ada and me at Zhuqiao. On the evening of the Lantern Festival, Gong Xiannü led more than a dozen bandits, including Chen Ada, to carry out the robbery. Because I was a neighbor of the Xues, I feared being recognized, so I stayed in Zhuqiao. The next morning, Chen Ada gave me fourteen yuan (eight yuan in banknotes and six yuan in silver). I asked him why I only received fourteen yuan when the Xues were robbed of tens of thousands of gold. He said, "Gong Xiannü distributed it; it's none of my business." The robbery of the Pan Jiahong family in Henan was done by five people. In the robbery of the Heng family and the Mian family, each person received two quilts and three cloth shirts. The robbery of the Qiu Defu family was carried out by six of us, led by Gong Xiannü. We stole thirty-five yuan in banknotes, twenty-seven thousand copper coins, and a pair of gold rings. Each person received eight yuan. The Xu Shuying family robbery was last April. I did it with Chen Ada and six others. I received a fur coat and six yuan in silver. The box cannon and pistol found by the Zhuqiao Security Corps in the Ni Rongsheng, Wu Dian, and Jiang Zhiren kidnapping cases were issued by Gong Xiannü. The two pistols seized from Gui Xiaoqi and Zhu Yennü were also Gong Xiannü's. This is the truth.</p>
<p>Chen Muquan confessed: I am twenty-eight years old. My original name was Wang Yejin, but I took the surname Gong and was also known as Gong Jingen. I used the alias Chen Muquan at the police station. In the Yu Genlin and Zhang San kidnapping cases, Gong Xiannü instructed my cousin Wang Junsheng (who had already been executed with Yang A'gen) to tell me to borrow Gong Axiao's house to hide the hostage, which I did. I was responsible for providing food for the hostage. The robberies of the Jin family in the fifth Tuan, Xingqianqiao, Hedong, the Zhang Nanbing family in the fourth Jia of the fifth Tuan, and the Cai family in Waishatou were done with Chen Ada, Song Abai, Zhu Yennü, Gui Xiaoqi, Zhu Yemeimei, Zhu Mengnan, Zhou Zhitiao, etc. It is true that we repeatedly robbed and spent the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Song Quanfu confessed: I am thirty-two years old and from the second Jia of the fifth Tuan. I used to be in the Sichuan shipping business. Now I run an opium den at No. 87, Baxianfang, Baxianqiao, in the French Concession. Song Abai and others sometimes came to hang out and smoke opium. I really didn't know they were bandits; please have mercy.</p>
<p>The Zhuqiao Security Corps and the Fifth Public Security Bureau have jointly prepared a document to present to the Nanhui County Government for investigation and handling. The people of Zhuqiao are all delighted. It is also reported that various circles are preparing a joint petition to the Security Corps, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>市中心區領地餘波</h3>
<h3>Aftermath of Land Acquisition in the City Center Area</h3>
<p>▲第一號抽籤人之聲明</p>
<p>▲Statement from the First Lottery Winner</p>
<p>The situation regarding land acquisition in the city center area has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. However, there are still issues with Zhang Zisong, the representative of Datongyuan Paper Company, who was the first lottery winner. This newspaper has received a letter from the company as follows: "To whom it may concern, our company bid for land in the city center area. Due to Director Zhu's discriminatory methods against our company and other lottery winners, our company's right to select land was unreasonably deprived. After the dispute arose, our company immediately sent a letter to the bureau questioning this, but has not received a reply to this day. We have read in various newspapers that the first lottery winner did not bring enough funds and only acquired one plot, which is not in line with the facts at the time. Therefore, we are providing a brief account of what happened. My colleagues and I, feeling the difficulty of living in Shanghai, gathered a group of friends and organized a group to bid for land in the city center area of Shanghai. In accordance with the Land Bureau's land acquisition notice, at 7:00 AM on July 21st, we sent designated representative Zhang Zisong, accompanied by manager Zhu Xiaoqin, to the Land Bureau to bid. We waited until about 10:00 AM (originally scheduled for 8:00 AM) when the lottery began. There were a total of 500 lottery numbers. At around 11:00 AM, Zhang Zisong drew the first number. He then signed his name under the number one on the signature book, and indicated that he intended to acquire four plots. At this time, the lottery was not yet complete, but five or six staff members of the Land Bureau suddenly rushed Zhang Zisong inside. Zhang was surrounded and could not go outside the lottery room to report to the manager and arrange for her to come inside. Later, the staff members of the bureau instructed him to choose which plots and urged him to quickly pay the land fees, pointing to the 5,000 yuan in silver he had brought and declaring that he was only allowed to acquire a little over ten mu of land. Zhang Zisong immediately stated that the funds he had brought were sufficient to cover the cost of four plots, but because of the crowd, he was concerned about potential dangers. He said that he had separately carried the funds at the manager Zhu Xiaoqin's place, and she was also in the bureau and could be easily retrieved. He wanted to go outside the bureau to get the funds from Zhu, but the staff members of the bureau sternly stopped him. Zhang Zisong was young and timid (18 years old) and did not dare to speak up further. At that time, other land acquirers, such as Yu Xiangxian and Zhan Peilin, saw this situation and testified on his behalf, confirming that Zhang Zisong had enough funds stored with Zhu Xiaoqin, and petitioned on his behalf to allow him to acquire the land in accordance with the law. Thereupon, the staff members of the bureau agreed to fill out the application form for four plots. Zhang Zisong then selected plots 23, 24, 42, and 43. Just as he was about to finish filling out the form, the Shanghai Bank drew the second number. But Director Zhu suddenly arrived and said that he had telegraphed the municipal government for instructions, saying that the lottery winner had only brought 5,000 yuan when drawing the lottery and was not allowed to acquire four plots. Zhang Zisong reiterated the previous situation, but Director Zhu did not wait for him to finish and announced that the first lottery winner did not have enough funds and was disqualified. At this time, Zhu Xiaoqin had entered the bureau after hearing the news and immediately argued that Zhang Zisong, the representative of our company, did not bring insufficient funds, but that he was afraid of accidents and had stored the funds on her person. She said that she could pay the full amount immediately when the land was acquired and that according to the land acquisition method, there would be no problems with the time and procedures. She then presented the funds to the director (the bureau originally stipulated that the payment deadline was 4:00 PM on the same day). Director Zhu refused to accept and said that only the funds personally brought by Zhang Zisong when drawing the lottery could be used. Zhu Xiaoqin repeatedly argued, but Director Zhu only allowed her to acquire one plot and instructed her that otherwise, the right to acquire the land would be completely cancelled. At this time, the land acquirers in the bureau witnessed the situation and felt injustice on behalf of our company. They questioned the bureau, but Section Chief Hu of the bureau declared that he would send 100 to 200 police officers to the bureau to suppress them. Zhu Xiaoqin and Zhang Zisong, seeing the firm attitude of the bureau and the urgency of the situation, reluctantly complied with filling out the application form and acquired one plot. They still clearly stated to Director Zhu that they would reserve the remaining three plots pending a legal solution. Zhang Zisong then took the application form back to the cashier's office and paid 12,000 yuan in bank drafts and 375 yuan in silver. Because the Jiang drafts were not due until the 23rd, they were not accepted. Zhu Xiaoqin then issued a blank check from Datongyuan Paper Company to Yongfeng Bank for 12,000 yuan and presented it, obtaining a receipt for the payment, and was then able to acquire plot 24 and leave. This was what happened on that day. Our company's land acquisition procedures were handled in accordance with the land acquisition method promulgated by the municipal government and the land acquisition notice of the Land Bureau, without any violations. However, Director Zhu repeatedly changed the method, making it difficult for land acquirers to comply, and the various situations he confronted our company with were particularly appalling. Our company was forced to submit to the strict authority of the administrative officials at the time. In addition to sending a letter to the director of the bureau questioning him the next day, we are providing details to clarify the truth."</p>

<h3>美豐銀行營業情形</h3>
<h3>The Business Situation of the American Oriental Banking Corporation</h3>
<p>The American Oriental Banking Corporation, in the first half of 1930, showed a satisfactory progress in the business accounts of all the head and branch offices in Shanghai and Tianjin. During this half-year, its net profit reached Shanghai silver dollars 414,770.04. This number is distributed as follows, including: payment of income tax in 1930, silver dollars 42,282.62, depreciation of property and equipment, 5,172.41, preferred stock dividend, 40,000.00, time stock dividend, interest on ordinary shares at 10%, 127,795.03, transferred to the next period account, 198,926.98, 414,177.04. Because the results of all business operations during this half-year are very satisfactory, and each department is developing, the board of directors decided to increase the issuance of ordinary shares, calculated in Shanghai local silver dollars. If the issuance of increased ordinary shares is issued, the capital surplus and undistributed profits in the bank will exceed 6 million silver dollars. The new shares must be purchased by the old shareholders, and if there is a surplus, it can be sold. This matter will be completed on July 31, 1931. Because the business is developing, all office space is insufficient for use and needs to be expanded. All plans have been prepared and a contract has been signed with the construction factory to immediately expand the bank building by 1,500 square feet. This expansion plan can be completed within a few months.</p>

<p>▲Zhejiang Provincial Government Misunderstands and Confiscates</p>
<p>▲國貨會電請發還</p>
<p>▲National Products Association Telegraphs for Return</p>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association believes that the sanitary paint produced by its member Huachang Manufacturing Factory has been falsely accused and mistakenly reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, resulting in the confiscation of products. It previously sent a letter to inquire about the matter. It has now received a reply from the factory reporting the details. The 19th meeting of the 20th Executive Supervisory Committee resolved to telegraph to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs to uphold justice and conduct a thorough investigation to clear the name of the national product and facilitate its sales. The original telegram stated: (omitted above) According to the factory's reply, the sanitary paint produced by our company is made by chemically combining useless scraps of leather and water, and does not contain any opium. It has been approved by the Central Health Testing Institute, registered by the Customs and Industry Department's National Trademark Registration Bureau, and approved by the Flying Orangutan trademark, and protected by official orders from various provincial, municipal, and county governments. The Zhejiang Department of Civil Affairs also sent personnel to the factory along with Chinese and Western staff from the Yangshupu Patrol Room of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to investigate and found no prohibited items. Western staff from the patrol room also certified that the factory has been operating for many years, manufacturing oils and does not contain opium. The concession authorities allow it to operate, and the products are inspected by the customs before export, otherwise how can they be sold at home and abroad? The Zhejiang authorities were misled by false reports, resulting in a misunderstanding, which will undoubtedly be cleared up. However, those who falsely accuse national products should be investigated. Please telegraph to prove it, request to uphold justice and conduct a thorough investigation, and so on. When the factory joined our association, it was required to send personnel to investigate and confirm that it was manufacturing paint and did not mix any toxic substances. This is evidenced by the inspection certificate of the Central Health Testing Institute, customs registration, and the testimony of patrol room staff, which is a legitimate business and there is no doubt about it. Therefore, we are specifically telegraphing to Your Excellency to conduct a thorough investigation,</p>
<p>return the confiscated products, and restore business operations (omitted below).</p>

<h3>One Birth, Three Children</h3>
<p>Luo Adi, a Jiangbei native residing in Dongshi, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, is 30 years old and works at Rongmao Sawmill. His wife, Wang, is 23 years old and also works at Toyota Yarn Factory. They have been married for five years and have not had any children. In March of last year, Luo was eagerly hoping for a child, and Wang suddenly became pregnant. Later, she gradually felt bloated. Unexpectedly, after ten months, there was no sign of childbirth. Her husband feared she was ill and consulted a doctor, who confirmed she was pregnant and had no illness. By this year, her abdomen felt even more enlarged, like a gourd weighing five piculs. Luo was even more anxious. However, Wang continued to work and live as usual. At 1:00 AM the day before yesterday, Wang suddenly felt abdominal pain. Her husband knew that she was about to give birth and prepared. When the clock struck seven, she indeed gave birth to a baby boy. In an instant, two more children were born. The sound of their cries shook the house. Luo was shocked and surprised. All three children were male, lively as usual, and had no strange features. Later, Luo heard superstitious words from neighbors, fearing they were monsters, and abandoned the three children outside the door, letting people watch. This caused a sensation and attracted onlookers from far and wide, who all said that the three children had no strange features and urged Luo to take them back and care for them. However, a birth of three children is indeed a rare event.</p>

Due to the continuous heavy rain in recent days, he was unable to work. Every morning, he dug up the vegetables he grew and carried them to the market to sell. Yesterday at around 3:40 AM, Wang still carried vegetables from his home, planning to go to Caojiadu Town. At that time, the heavy rain had slightly subsided, and the dawn was breaking. He hadn't gone far when he reached the small wooden bridge on the small river near Zhongshan Road. The bridge was submerged by water. Wang still stepped on the bridge in the water. He was careless and slipped into the river. Because he couldn't swim, he sank and died instantly. Later, his body floated up and was spotted by villagers, who reported it to his family, who rushed to retrieve it and prepared a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>Became a Thief Due to Lack of Livelihood</h3>
<p>▲陳仰蘇判押五年</p>
<p>▲Chen Yangsu Sentenced to Five Years in Prison</p>
<p>The bandit Chen Yangsu, on the night of the 22nd of last month, and Zhou Er, who is at large, tried to rob people on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. Just as Xu Qintang, a French Concession detective, came to inspect and ordered them to stop, he was about to search them when Zhou shot Xu in the left arm, injuring him and causing him to fall to the ground. At that time, the detectives only arrested Chen Yangsu, and Zhou escaped. Yesterday, the police sent Chen, the thief, to the criminal court of the French Concession Court for trial. The police chief first reported the previous situation. When questioned, Chen Yangsu confessed that he was from Funing and had not been in Shanghai for long. He had no way to make a living. Last month, he met Zhou Er, a fellow villager, on the road. He explained to him the plight of his livelihood. Zhou said that he would help him rob people on the road, that is, rob and live like a pig. The people had no choice but to agree. The first time, Zhou and his wife, a woman named Xiao Laohan, invited Chen and two others to go to Jin Shenfu Road, where they met a certain Jia. Zhou threatened him with a pistol, and his wife Xiao Laohan took the initiative to strip off his clothes and rob him. Chen kept watch nearby. The next day, Chen was given three yuan. The second time, the three went to Xujiahui to rob a certain person's clothes and other items. And until the third time, Chen and Zhou</p>
<p>were walking along Xujiahui Road and were searched by detectives. Zhou opened fire to resist arrest, and the people were arrested. That's the truth. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Chen to five years in the Western prison, and he will be deported from the concession forever after his term expires.</p>

<h3>Prostitute Escapes from Hell</h3>
<p>▲五年來備受苦楚</p>
<p>▲Suffered for Five Years</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaomei, a 19-year-old woman from Liuhe, is quite beautiful. When she was young, due to the poverty of her family, her parents arranged for her to be a child bride to the son of Wang Arong. She passed the door immediately. Later, when she was 14 years old, Wang Arong brought her to Shanghai and rented a house at No. 8 and a half, Rongqing Lane, Sixth Avenue, in the Public Concession, and opened a brothel. In that year, she was forced to do business. If she was slightly dissatisfied, she would be beaten. She could not agree. She has been doing it for five years. However, because she was weak and often sick, the old madam did not show any sympathy and still asked her to receive guests. If she did not obey, she would be beaten severely. The suffering was extreme. It was a living hell. In recent days, she has been suffering from illness and fever, and the rain has been falling for almost ten days, and there is nowhere to find customers. She asked the madam to let her rest for a few days, but Arong refused and beat her severely, causing her body to be covered with bruises, and still drove her out to find customers. At more than 11:00 the night before last, Xiaomei was complaining on the road. Taking advantage of the old madam's unpreparedness, she fled to Liu Fen Lane in the city and asked where the police station was, intending to seek help from the station. Patrolman Jiang Zhenshan inquired about the situation and immediately took her to the First Branch of the Second District. After Director Xu inquired whether she had any relatives, Xiaomei said that she had been sold to Wang Arong's son as a child bride by her parents since she was a child, so she had no relatives and did not want to engage in this flesh business anymore. She cried as she spoke, begging for relief. Director Xu, knowing the situation, decided to send her to the Public Security Bureau and then to the Women and Children Relief Association.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read in various newspapers, in the local news section, about the case of Zhao Guanqing suing Bei Runsheng, regarding the resolution reached today. The facts reported do not quite align with what actually occurred. Upon investigation, my clients, Bei Runsheng and his brothers Zhao Zhulin, are close relatives of the plaintiff Zhao Guanqing. Although they were involved in a lawsuit due to a momentary disagreement, Zhao Guanqing has now asked relatives and friends to mediate and voluntarily signed an agreement to settle the dispute, relinquishing all claims. On the side of my clients, they also accepted the advice of relatives and friends and provided financial assistance, paying 50,000 silver dollars. Today, their original lawyer requested the withdrawal of the review in court at the Public Concession Court. Furthermore, according to the evidence from both parties, the lawyer is Jin Yu, whose signature is well-known among our lawyers, and not lawyer Huang Huansheng. We have always admired your newspaper's commitment to recording everything it hears. I am sending this letter requesting a correction. With best wishes for your well-being.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lawyer Zou Shengzu, July 27th</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>On July 26th, your newspaper's local news section published a news item titled "Shanghai-Xiamen Wireless Communication Disconnected." I was extremely surprised upon reading it. After the recovery of domestic transmission rights from companies such as Da Dongbei, our station anticipated a surge in telegram traffic to Xiamen, Fuzhou, and other locations. We had previously submitted a request to install additional equipment on both sides, which was approved to facilitate the clearance of various cases. Although there has been persistent rainfall recently, all telegrams to Xiamen have been relayed by our station and delivered promptly as usual. There have been no instances of damage or disconnection, nor is there any reason to return received commercial telegrams. The facts are as they are and do not need to be concealed. We are concerned that inaccurate rumors may lead to misunderstandings, so we are sending this special letter to inform you. We hope you will investigate and make corrections to maintain our public relations. Addressed to the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, from the Shanghai Wireless Telegraph General Station of the Ministry of Communications, July 27th.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Reviews</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Shanghai Concessions</h3>
<p>— Tiehua</p>
<p>Compiled and translated by Cen Dezhang, sold by World Da Dong</p>
<p>At a time when the entire nation is united in its efforts to recover the concessions, I believe that this compilation and translation of "A Brief History of the Shanghai Concessions" is a very good contribution. Therefore, I am introducing it here to the people of the country as reference material and historical discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the history of the Shanghai concessions, I am afraid there are many people who do not understand it clearly. We only know that the origin of the concessions was due to the failure of the Opium War and the opening of treaty ports. But the details of how it happened and the gradual expansion, I think all Chinese people should pay attention to. This book tells us all the things we urgently need to know.</p>
<p>This book was compiled and translated by Mr. Cen Dezhang based on A Short History of Shanghai by Morse, supplemented by various books and interviews with elders. The entire book has more than 360 pages and is supplemented by a chronology of major events in the Shanghai concessions, starting from the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing between China and Britain on August 29th of the 22nd year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty until the 19th year of the Republic of China. The major events of the concessions are listed in a chronological table. The entire book is divided into 28 chapters, including the signing of treaties and trade, the establishment of concessions, red-headed city occupation, the revision of regulations, the Taiping Rebellion, the scale of municipal administration, construction overview, the Siming Public Institute incident, the development of transportation, the revision of regulations, the foundation of education, the fiftieth anniversary celebration, the industrial revolution, the expansion of concessions, the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year, the Boxer Protocol in the Xin Chou year, the big commotion at the public hall, building roads beyond the boundaries, the Wuchang Uprising, raising troops to fight against Yuan Shikai, the European war, resisting the attached laws, the Lincheng train robbery, the Qi-Lu war, the May Thirtieth Movement, etc. Each chapter is further divided into dozens of subsections. The historical events of the concessions are exhaustively covered. This kind of collection is really not easy.</p>
<p>The whole book is very long, and it is difficult to list everything in detail. Here is a brief introduction to one or two points regarding the origin of the concessions:</p>
<p>"Shanghai was declared a treaty port on November 14th of the 22nd year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty (1843). Pottinger did not mention concessions in the treaty, and the matter was left to Balfour and the Shanghai Daotai to resolve through mutual consultation. At that time, the Chinese officials opposed the establishment of concessions, thinking that selling land would violate national laws. Later, the sale was changed to perpetual lease, and the tenants paid an annual rent. At that time, the price of land was about 15 to 35 strings of cash per mu, while the price charged to foreigners was 50 to 60 strings (about 50 to 60 silver dollars). The annual rent was about 1 string and 500 cash."</p>
<p>Regarding the boundaries of the concessions:</p>
<p>"The four boundaries of the concessions were not initially defined. Roughly, the east was bounded by the Huangpu River, the south by the Yangjingbang, and the north by what is now Beijing Road, while the west had no clear boundaries. Later, boundary roads were designated as the boundaries, namely the current Henan Road. The land initially included in the concessions was 150 acres (English acres)..."</p>
<p>During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, the book contains a vivid description of the life of foreigners in Shanghai: "Every day, they would go to the racecourse to test their horses, with a leisurely attitude. Those who liked to engage in Qingtan (pure conversation) would gather at the Huangpu Bund. At that time, the Bund Road was very wide and equal to the concessions. In the morning, porters gathered, and as the sun set, foreign merchants and local women strolled leisurely, creating a harmonious scene. All those who came east with the envoys recognized Shanghai as a paradise in China."</p>
<p>Since the Taiping Army rose and approached Shanghai, the Qing court did not hesitate to ask foreigners for help and joined the battle. The Changsheng Army (Ever Victorious Army) monument in the Bund Park is a tribute established by Li Hongzhang. The rogue foreigner Ward was the first to lead foreign troops to help the Qing court, so after his death in battle, his name was listed at the top of the monument.</p>
<p>Later, the scale of municipal administration gradually developed. The establishment of the Public Concession, and the merger of the British and American Concessions, implied the idea of changing the concessions into a free city. In other words, the Shanghai Concessions would be an independent republic. At that time, the British Consul Medhurst was still able to uphold justice, saying, "This piece of land originally belonged to China, but only allowed the contracting countries to exercise their consular jurisdiction here. It was never intended to abandon its sovereignty over the land and people of China." British envoy Bruce also objected, saying, "The nature of the Shanghai Concessions is neither cession nor lease. All the land we own still belongs to the territory of China." However, after more than 80 years of delay, what kind of phenomenon has it become now?</p>
<p>The collection in the book is very rich. To list them all individually is really not as good as reading through the entire book. So I don't want to spend any more time writing. However, the story of the origin of Jishi Fei Er Road is very interesting: "The name Jishi Fei Er Road has an anecdotal story. It is said that a Portuguese gentleman, while passing by the Hongkou Circus, heard a woman crying sadly in a tent. So he redeemed her and sent her to a American missionary for upbringing. The woman later learned to talk to a gentleman and went to the United States to study. After returning to China, she married the gentleman. The woman's name was Jishi, so the area was jokingly called Jishi Fei Er." There are many such records in the book, and there is no need to list them all to take up space.</p>
<p>In short, this book, although called A Brief History of the Shanghai Concessions, its content is already specific and is indeed a history book that our people must read. When the reporter carried it on the tram to read, many people eagerly asked about the place of publication, which shows that many people pay attention to and are more eager for the history of the concessions. Then, the value of this book and the meaning of its publication do not need me to talk anymore.</p>
<p>The price of this book is two yuan, or maybe it can be discounted to 1.9 yuan. I think that when it is reprinted, the font can be reduced, the paper can be reduced, and the price can be reduced in order to popularize it. I dare to say this to the compiler Mr. Cen.</p>
<h3>The Three Principles of the People and Population Policy</h3>
<p>— Shih Huai</p>
<p>By Chen Changheng</p>
<p>I have read many books about population issues and population policies written in Chinese. Some are too simple, and some are not simple, but they are too old. Several seem better, but unfortunately, they are translated from foreign countries. Their background and position are not China, and it seems that there is a layer of separation for me personally. It can be regarded as a good book in the current publications on population issues and population policies by our own people.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>I think that apart from this book "The Three Principles of the People and Population Policy" that I am going to introduce now, I cannot find another one to compare.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Mr. Chen Changheng, is currently a member of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government. He has been engaged in the study of population issues for at least ten years. His most important work is "On Chinese Population," a book introducing the Malthusian theory and opposing neo-Malthusianism. Later, in the "Eastern Miscellany," "Modern Review," and "China Review Weekly," there were papers on population issues. This book is a collection of his research over the past ten years on the quantity of China's population and the theories of natural environment, social environment, and heredity on racial evolution in the West, as well as the universal fertility revolution created by his research.</p>
<p>The book is divided into twelve chapters, totaling 342 pages, which can be said to be a masterpiece. The titles of each chapter are as follows: Chapter 1, the overall classification of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's population theory; Chapter 2, the population issue as a prerequisite for the thorough realization of the Three Principles of the People; Chapter 3, a new estimate of the total population of China; Chapter 4, how to maintain the population density that "exceeds the species principle"; Chapter 5, population density and life standards; Chapter 6, population policies regarding quality; Chapter 7, the relationship between the natural environment and racial evolution; Chapter 8, the relationship between genetic advantages and disadvantages and racial evolution; Chapter 9, the relationship between good and bad habits, superior and inferior culture, and racial evolution; Chapter 10, the positive significance, philanthropy, and scientific basis of the fertility revolution; Chapter 11, the specific plan of the fertility revolution and the guiding facilities that the government should have; Chapter 12, conclusion.</p>
<p>The book strongly criticizes foreign scholars such as Willcox, who believe that the household survey of the Ministry of Civil Affairs in the second year of Xuantong, "the national population is 320 million," is accurate. He cited many counties that underreported households and the inaccuracy of the number of people per household being 43. As a result, he revised the population in the second year of Xuantong to be 385 million. He also calculated that the average population growth rate in China in the past 18 years is 11 per thousand, which is slightly higher than the world's average population growth rate of 8 per thousand. From this, he further calculated that the total population of our country now should be 470 million. Aren't we often saying 400 million? He is now overturning this old saying. He tells us that the current population of China is too large. The population suitable for our current situation is 250 million, and our population doubles every 60 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Changheng strongly argues for the relationship between population quantity and population quality. A saturated population density mostly has a counter-selection effect in its natural selection process. Therefore, he believes that a government should formulate a timely population density. In this timely population density, the highest life standard can be maintained.</p>
<p>The universal fertility revolution is the population policy created by Mr. Chen to formulate a timely population density. The universal fertility revolution has three meanings: (1) It can avoid the focus of international competition, equalize the differences in international culture, and promote the world's great unity; (2) It can reduce the time difference between joy and sorrow, the geographical difference, and the human difference to increase the value of life and human happiness; (3) It can reduce the difference in gender and the number of men and women to maintain the quantitative balance of the sexes and promote the common happiness of the sexes.</p>
<p>His specific plan is: (1) Abolish the patriarchal early marriage and concubinage; (2) Implement one-flower and two-flower policies (i.e., one boy and one girl, and two boys and two girls); (3) The fertility revolution should be mainly guided and nurtured by the government.</p>
<p>Finally, I quote the conclusion of this book as the end of this article: "...We must be under the guidance of such an approachable, lovely, admirable, and respectable leader. Only then can the Chinese nation be truly saved. Our blue sky, white sun, flawless jade, supreme and divine, and forever the new utopia of East Asia can be safely and soundly produced. Only then can our people forever enjoy a more noble civilization, more abundant and healthier, more just and pure, more loving and free, more complete and beautiful, and more glorious and sacred common life and personal life. Our future, as beautiful as a tapestry, is a new utopia that is the new kingdom of heaven shared by all our people, and it is the road that we must take from 'one person in China' to 'one family in the world'."</p>

<h3>After Watching the Joint Photography Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Guangmei</p>
<p>Although it cannot be said to be an unprecedented initiative, it is a very rare opportunity. Shanghai, which ranks first in civilization in the country, can often see exhibitions of Chinese and Western paintings, but photography exhibitions are not common. A long time ago, the Times Museum held a photography exhibition, and I was also one of the visitors. Unfortunately, the only impression it gave me was admiration for the author's superb skills, and nothing else special. In fact, even such an ordinary exhibition cannot be seen often.</p>
<p>Suddenly giving us a long-desired request, the Joint Photography Exhibition is open for two weeks at the Jiande Apartment on North Sichuan Road. The main authors are Mr. Lu Shifu and Mr. Lang Jingshan. The research and artistic excellence of these two gentlemen in photography have long been admired by the general public. However, I have to be surprised and amazed at Mr. Lu's achievements. It turns out that Mr. Lu Shifu is a well-known German doctor, but I never thought that he would be so accomplished in photographic art.</p>
<p>In previous photography exhibitions, we only saw landscapes, still lifes, and jade shadows of beautiful modern girls, but rarely saw attention to the human body. Human body photography can be said to be difficult to find. In the works of Mr. Lu and Mr. Lang, they paid a lot of attention to this aspect. In Mr. Lu's works, nudes and beauties are especially numerous. For example, "Shame" is an extremely beautiful painting. From this exhibition, I resolutely eliminated my long-held dogmatic prejudice that photography is not as easy to express as painting. I am now saying this: photography and painting are not inferior to each other. As long as you get the right method, they are equally vivid. This correction was given to me by Mr. Lu and Mr. Lang. I should be grateful.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu and Mr. Lang are able to pay attention to the human body, which is of course worthy of admiration. However, there is one thing, the human body works on display are all female, which is a small issue worth discussing. I hope that Mr. Lu and Mr. Lang can pay attention to the male aspect in the future, and express the strong and brave male beauty. At the same time, I hope that in the next exhibition, there will be more dazzling works on display in front of our eyes.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Dumps Kerosene in Dong Province</h3>

It is reported that the Russian side will then dump matches, timber, flour, and other items, depending on the performance of Hong Shun Sheng Company.</p>

<h3>New Survey of American Movies</h3>
<p>Investment of 500 Million US Dollars, Exports of Over 200 Million Feet</p>
<p>According to American newspapers, the average daily transaction of films in the American film industry reaches 2,500 miles, which, when extended, is enough to circle the earth. Also, 18 million people enter the cinema every week. Due to the transformation from silent films to sound films, the amount invested in the film industry in the past year for equipment and other expenses totaled 500 million US dollars. On the one hand, the year 1930 indicated that sound films conquered silent films. From January to September, the United States exported 210 million feet of film, of which about 118 million feet were sound films, accounting for about 67 percent, and silent films accounted for about 33 percent.</p>

<h3>The Life of Working Women in New York</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>Clara arrived at the hotel five minutes late. She found this to be a very enjoyable act, because it could show the spirit of independence. She didn't have to swipe the time clock. She locked her coat and hat together and then strolled naturally through the hall. Many people watched her. From her expression, it seemed that she was indifferent to all the attention. In fact, she was not. The girl she was replacing was eager to leave. She had started work at six in the morning and was now very hungry. She greeted Clara very warmly. They didn't have much friendship, but they were very trustworthy. They worked together for several hours every day, so naturally everyone had some secrets to tell. Secretly, everyone was jealous. If someone wore a new dress, the other would eagerly admire it, but secretly she was very jealous and wanted to outdo her. Clara's colleague was named Luo Xuetuo. She was very proud of her name.</p>
<p>Clara stood behind the counter to take over her duties and automatically began to tidy up the display windows.</p>
<p>"Busy?" she asked Luo Xuetuo.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, no. The manager told me that there will be a big gathering next week. Anyway, we can always find a meal there." These women have learned a special skill to dig for gold. They have ways to ask men to take them to dinner and to the theater. The lobby of the hotel is indeed a wonderful place. They can quickly and accurately judge a person. They are unwilling to go out with stingy people. They don't mind being patted on the cheek or secretly kissed. These women know how to take care of themselves. Their appearance is very stubborn, and their hearts are as hard as their appearance. Every day, hundreds of young people with confused ideals pass through the lobby of a big city hotel, seeking to live without any blows or traumas. Therefore, the only way to treat people is with a cynical attitude. Clara also does this, but there is still some reservation. The background of her soul is a beautiful and romantic picture, but there are still reservations. Clara knows that love alone is not enough for her. Love must be combined with money.</p>
<p>Men stand outside the cigarette counter and talk every day. Most of them are just deceiving the girls, or teasing them a little. The initial expression of radical men cannot be separated from the sentence "Where have you been all my life?" The answers to this sentence are different, depending on how the girls know them. Clara might say, "I've been waiting for you here until that lucky day comes," or "I won't go anywhere else in my life."</p>
<p>Some men tell the girls many secrets, business difficulties, and past experiences. The girls are very sensible. There are very few people who live in the hotel permanently. Most of them are temporary travelers and returning guests. The girls recognize the guests who leave and come back often.</p>
<p>The time Clara spends standing at the counter passes very quickly. She often feels like she is on the stage, playing a role. She studies every move she makes. When she changes shifts to eat, at three o'clock in the afternoon, she has bad luck, because she must take out her own money to buy food. How happy she would be to run to the hotel's tea room, order a salad, some meat, ice, and coffee, and not have to pay for it herself. There is a Chinese chop suey restaurant across the street. For fifty cents, you can get a full meal, plus a dime for the tip. Clara runs to this restaurant. She doesn't want to pay so much money for a meal. However, she speculates that she often spends a lot of money on food. If she often eats by herself, she doesn't know how she will live. A bedroom costs fifteen yuan per week, and each person has to pay seven yuan and five cents. There is also the cost of the public bus, and the most is clothing. Broadway is not like Fifth Avenue, which is the center of clothing styles. They know the effect of clothes and use clothes to please others. In the hotel, they have to wear dark clothes. Clara often uses satin to make clothes. She likes cute socks and boots, especially patterned boots and shoes. Somehow, she breaks boots and shoes more easily than other girls. This expense is not small. (To be continued)</p>
