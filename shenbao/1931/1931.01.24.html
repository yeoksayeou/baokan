<h3 id="c36">法內閣又倒 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>法國之急進黨史悌內閣。今又突然以總辭職聞矣。夫法內閣之改組。本如奕棋。絕鮮支撑數年而不動者。况此史悌內閣。在成立之初法報大多數即料其不久今果以增加穀類定價之一問題被攻而倒矣。</p>
<p>以德英法三國政象言之。法政府所遇政局上之困難。不如德英政府之甚也。法政黨之反對其政府。亦不如德英政黨之激昻也。然德英兩國之政府。雖屢遇政局上之重大難關。受議會中之猛烈攻擊。一時感覺棘手而常能轉危爲安。法政府則輒以小小問題而倒者何也蓋其中有不同之點二焉。一則因德政府憲法上之權力大也。大總統對於政令有緊急處分之權對於議會爭持不下有最後之救濟故白魯寗內閣雖經議會極嚴重之彈劾。而賴總統扶翼之力終能巍然屹立於飄搖風雨之中。不因外界之摧撼而遽倒。一則因英政府工黨勢力之鉅也英工黨政府之基礎。本甚鞏固近其黨中雖小有變化。信仰不免稍减。但其勢力尚足以應付敵黨之反對。保守黨等屢提不信任麥克唐內閣案。以全力猛攻政府而終能脫免險境。如昨日保守黨在下院通過教育修正案。而麥氏尚不認爲失敗而辭職。即其一證也法政府在法律上。旣無如德政府有龐大之權力。而在政黨中又無如英工黨堅强之結合。故一遇略爲困難之間題。即倉猝無法應付此法內閣之所以易倒歟。</p>

<p>日來新聞之最惹人注意者丶莫若西康學生參觀團來滬事。月之十八日。滬上七團體聯合開歡迎大會。開會時。行禮如儀。由上海中學校長鄭通和主席。并致歡迎詞丶凡分三點。（一）民國反正以來。循環戰爭。不克統一丶以故對於邊疆事業歷屆均未能顧及。今國府統一。預爲設計。訓練之西康班已畢業。從此改造西康有人矣丶（二）西康地處邊陲。交通滯塞。國人初不知其風俗習慣。如西行艶異記一書多侮及川邊女性。今請西康人說明眞相。</p>
<p>免除疑竇。（三）西康前雲南。後青海。左西藏。右四川。與全國關係匪淺。而一切沉寂席敗如故。有該生等出。康事庶有豸乎。次爲中華職敎社邊促會代表潘仰堯致詞。亦有另外三點意義丶於歡迎中帶擴大職業指導敎育於邊疆之濃厚色彩。又次爲曾留歐十年勤工儉學成功之盛成。演說牧民生活與居民生活之演進。及吾民族應恢復牧民生活之重要丶盛君以教授之神氣。變化不測之態度。與言詞活潑之口吻表出。博得掌聲不少。再次爲東北大學教授田徊錦歷述歐美各國市政之槪况。至此即由上中口琴隊演奏。使觀衆神經爲之一清·旋由該團教務員陸舒農答詞。</p>

<p>疇昔之日。中華口琴會假座華安大厦八樓。舉行會員茶話會。到百餘人。除饒有與趣之餘興外。尚有蔡元培褚民誼陳鶴琴諸先生之演講。良以先生講題爲﹁音樂與體育﹂言之獨詳。良以先生爲衛生家。又爲體育家。是故能闡發靡遺也。茲姑記其大略。以爲硏究音樂與體育者告。丶先生謂音樂中以口琴爲最佳。價廉易學且簡便。不若西洋樂器丶動輒數十百元。費數載之光陰。尚難覓其門徑也。至音樂之於人生。實自有生以俱來。初生即能哭丶此即爲其音樂。亦即爲其體育。蓋哭能使人肺部擴張也。爲人母者。每見嬰孩啼哭。即哺之以乳。此實最不衛生之舉動。理宜切戒。又中西伶人之體質之强弱。實有天壤之別。歐西名伶。極知衛生丶是故丹田充足。聲浪洪大。登台時間極長。自始至終。毫無懈怠。反觀中國名伶丶多染惡嗜。身體衰弱。嗓音旣低。又伴以極響之樂器丶且時間又短殊不能引起觀衆之有肅靜之秩序。雖中西戲劇。性質不同。結構各異。但名伶身體强弱頗有關係。是故研究音樂。亦須注意體育。中國唱工講究丹田。太極拳亦重視丹田。丹田彷彿即是橫隔膜。欲使肺部運動向左右開屢之外。并須上下開展。此皆屬於體育問題者。今吾人苟持口琴。朝暮徐吹。亦足使肺部容易擴大。未始非體育之一助。豈僅消閒娛樂而已哉。</p>

<p>六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>（二）多諾哥</p>
<p>今年巴黎新上演的幾齣新戲中。最使人注意而又最受評劇家的討論的要算洛曼（JulesRomains）的近作「多諾哥」（Donogoo）了。</p>
<p>洛曼是現在法國的第一流詩人兼戯曲作家。他是專門硏究一種複　的集合心理的「一致派「</p>
<p>（Ecole　unanime）諸文人的領袖。他也寫過好幾本小說。如「或人之死（La　mort　de　quelnu，un）</p>
<p>）「琉西樣」（Lucienne）等都是很有名的。但他在文學界最有利的成功却是他的劇本「克諾克」（</p>
<p>Knock　Le　Trlomphe　de　la　medesineo「克諾克」是一本專門諷駡醫生的喜</p>
<p>劇。他把現代許多沒有良心的醫生借着科學的美名去嚇詐羣衆。使得無病人變成有病的那種陰險手腕暴露無餘。他這種向醫生挑戰的態度。簡直和法國十七世紀大喜劇作家莫理哀氏（Moliere）後先　映。但他的諷駡比莫理哀的還要刻毒。「克諾克」上演後雖受到各地醫士會的激烈反</p>
<p>對。但一般觀衆却異常讚美。賣座之盛爲近十年來所少見。</p>
<p>今年上演的這本「多諾哥」並不能完全算是新作。十年前洛曼氏曾用這題材寫過一本電影劇豋在Nouvelle　Revue　Francaise上面。這次不過改成舞臺用的劇本罷了。但在早幾月前當各新聞和劇院廣告把「多諾哥」將在皮加劇院（Theatre　Pigalle）排演的消息露佈後。一般有戲劇嗜好的早在期待着。把這事當作一種珍聞。當作戲劇界的一大改變。這爲甚麼緣故呢。一則因爲洛曼的聲望大。二則排演「多諾哥」的皮加劇院最近改裝的機關舞臺雖不敢說世界第一·但至少在巴黎可算得最新最大的了。三則因這「多諾哥」的上演可以窺舞臺戯劇將來究竟會不會被電影</p>
<p>淘汰。</p>

<h3 id="c203">新的努力 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 王道源</p>
<p>前次我們學校開了一個展覽會丶居然獲得社會上一般人士的注意丶這眞使我們太高興了丶我們已經知道丶社會對於藝的術的要求丶對於藝術的熱力丶並不曾淡薄丶社會對於我們的努力丶並不曾說是無意識丶並不曾與以輕蔑嘲笑丶就是這一點丶已夠使我們放下沉重的畫筆丶感到相當的快慰丶何况又有一般愛好藝術者丶加以親切的獎詞和無窮的勉勵呢丶我們感謝之餘丶只有把住我們的將米丶益加奮勵丶以我們的全毅力去兌換那極光輝的未來藝術丶這是我們此刻的一點野心丶這是靠我們整個藝壇的努力丶</p>
<p>回國以來丶埋頭江灣路丶終日與學徒顏色相周旋丶自從决定自築校舍以後丶腦子中就無端地添了一些木頭甎瓦之類的東西在跳躍丶似乎忙得很夠丶對於國內的藝術丶和自己的工作丶從沒有說過一句話丶今天已經拿起筆來丶我得就便說些丶</p>
<p>去年的一切丶已經成了過去丶在這個新的年頭丶我們自然應該有些新的努力丶　　我們現在所要求的對象丶舖張修飾丶似乎已失了威權丶我們所希翼着的丶是在一幅畫裏面使我人融化的偉大的靈魂丶不過丶畫筆究竟應該在什麼地方停止丶思想應該在什麼地方檯頭丶這在繪畫中丶都不是容易决斷的事體丶總之一幅具有高超而豐富的思想的畫丶無論牠是怎樣的粗索難看丶可是牠終於要比那細緻巧好而乏內容的作品來得有價值丶所以John.Ruskin有這樣的話丶一篇最妙的文章丶和一幅絕好的圖畫丶應該在牠內存的尊嚴上加以一切表白所能感動丶和修飾的東西丶但到了極卓絕境地丶此等東西丶仍歸沒有用處丶······我們更歡喜那種能夠觸發一種在他本來的美的狀態下的觀念的單純的文字和線條丶</p>
<p>現在我們知道丶畫家的生命丶是在他作品的內蓄的雄偉丶外表的細巧的華麗丶不是我們追求的鵠的丶同時我們應該澄清我們的頭腦丶從現社會的矛盾的背景底下丶去找我們的畫材丶</p>
<p>時代已經臨到我們的面前丶我們應該穩把着我們的畫筆丶使藝術的「力」丶做着時代的前鋒丶我們的晝家啊丶我們的「</p>
<p>力」丶</p>
<p>此刻說到我們的學校丨上海藝專丶總算是隨着時代在奮鬬的一個藝術團體丶雖然只有一年的歷史丶牠這一年來的努力丶已經呈獻給社會丶自己自不願所多自詡的丶牠以後的情形丶只有牠本身實際的工作才能表白丶實際的工作丶便是牠的內容丶浮誇和外飾丶我們不大需要丶那種千篇一律的所謂學士派的不進步的傳統勢力丶我們尤其要將牠打成粉碎丶</p>
<p>這是値得說及的丶在今年丶我們學校有一種社會藝術的服務丶要造成一種濃厚的藝術空氣丶非從這種努力起不可丶這種努力的最先非從兒童的繪畫敎育做起不可丶我們深以爲丶</p>
<p>是這樣的决定丶我們附近的小學丶均由我們去義務地去接收他們的藝術敎育丶將素來不大爲人注意的圖畫課程丶予以充分的興趣丶使天　　漫的兒童心靈丶很明澈地表示出來丶少小的巧妙的手腕丶對着自然反映出來丶這是何等神明美妙的事呀丶藝術化之兒童世界之造就丶這是藝術界何等偉大的成功啊丶</p>
<p>我們看看我們隣國丶日本畫家們丶自從提倡兒童自由畫運動以後丶他們是得到怎樣滿意的結果丶他們在那裏大聲疾呼地說丶</p>
<p>「我們志在使我們的藝術成爲最順潮流的東西丶而感到這事丶眞的非從兒童的繪畫教育上起始不可丶」他們這樣一來丶影響很大丶各處都與以同情與聲援丶於是日本藝術敎育上呈現一種活躍的新景象丶</p>
<p>現在我們應該不後人的丶也這樣幹起來丶</p>
<p>委實的丶「美」是這樣的一種東西丶暗示自然的機密丶啓發深邃的智慧丶要是專靠範本的描摹丶或師傅的傳授丶那終於是「美」的墮落丶</p>
<p>自不待言丶我國各小學校裏的圖畫鐘點丶是被認爲不甚重要的課目丶成績如何丶學校就也不大注意丶像是一種可有可無的東西丶不過弄來點綴點綴而已丶敎員多半是給他們一種範本臨臨丶敷衍一二點鐘丶因之兒童們就也感到索然乏味丶　　現在我們最重要的丶就是廢除臨本丶使小孩子們直接去表現丶我們首定的相信丶兒童直接從﹁自然﹂去吸取的形影和色彩丶一定比模寫那種經過粗劣印刷的大人畫之範本丶來得興趣格外濃厚丶</p>
<p>根本的丶在兒童的繪畫上丶與大人們的觀照力丶感覺是兩樣的丶兒童自有兒童的觀察和情感丶敎授者只可與之說明丶以資啓發丶萬不可使其盲從範本的作品丶尤其要的丶是使兒童自己拿住一種力量丶使兒童自由地描寫對象丶充分地發揮自己的觀感力丶這便是使他對著自然而擴大自己的力量丶</p>
<p>臨本是一種枯萎無生趣的東西丶兒童的心和手丶都是生機活潑的丶用一種枯萎的器具丶束縛着活潑的心手丶這是多無聊的一回事呵丶</p>
<p>於此我們知道丶那種依樣葫蘆式的臨摹丶只能使兒童造成一種永不可變的模倣的劣根性丶不可限量的創造力於焉消沉丶</p>
<p>可是舉國滔滔丶差不多所有的小學校丶都是在做臨本生活丶而所謂敎育者丶對藝術敎育的無法進展丶又素不在乎丶至於繪畫的訓練丶於兒童「美」的修養丶是有怎樣重大的關係丶他們實不曾夢想過丶這於藝術敎育的前途丶是非常暗澹的丶</p>
<p>現在我們决在這方面來努一番力丶尚望熱心敎育家丶有以敎我丶</p>
<h3 id="c204">日本獨立美術協會處女展之話 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 林鏞</p>
<p>日本獨立美術協會是從二科會脫退而成的丶在去年我已經說過丶處女展覽會便在這一九三一年一月十一日開幕了丶獨立美術丶在日本丶的確算是獨立丶我敢斷定丶在日本美術壇上丶雖然還不及二科會之成績丶但至野藝術團體丶二科會外丶就要是這跟着一九三○年而起的獨立美術協會可以希望有抗拒帝國美術院的力量了丶便至這次處女展的作品中丶我們可以很清楚的看見他們會員的　　丶當然丶有不少看了的人說所有新人選的作品是値不得看的丶這是實事丶但這不過是獨面的攻擊吧了丶但在會員的責任的努力丶的確是努力丶而且有的作家的作品比前更有進步丶</p>
<p>全會場的作品都是後期印像派丶新野獸羣丶以黃綠赤黑做主要銀色丶筆調是衝動的丶畫面是象徵的丶對象只不過做了他們的畫面的外廓丶這樣的作品在日本丶便在東方的美術壇上的確是有獨立的可能丶</p>
<p>入選的作品多是鼓勵新進以推廣新野獸之羣的丶我想丶</p>
<p>女優的作品能得入選於日本的美術展覽會的丶田中絹代是第一人丶這在新興美術的氣氛裏並不是奇怪事丶現在時代是新了丶美術是新時代的導引者丶他們有這樣的宣言丶</p>
<p>「丨丨美術是要大衆的支持的丶而旣成畫壇的丶最初是把那不放在眼中的女流作家的作品丶倘若只拿來看看也是好的丶丨丨」</p>
<p>里見勝藏氏說丶「······鐘沒有打着羣</p>
<p>衆是不走的啦丶那鐘被聽聞了麼丶」</p>
<p>林重義氏說丶﹁很新鮮的作品是愉快的丶傾向是决定偏於新野獸主義（NewForcism）種種色樣都有丶但不同色彩的是避免丶這樣做丶女性的作品入選是不少的丶······」</p>
<p>從來的寫實主義的丶自然主義的作品丶都可以見是被打破了丶規矩的資格的的規例都是被摧了丶我們一踏進了他們的會場去丶便很明白地給我們的眼睛曉得的丶奇怪的姿態丶刺激的畫面丶不規矩的綫條丶放蕩的色彩丶機械美的表現丶科學的描寫丶我們一看丶眼睛是必會驚異的　　兒島善三郞氏的丶﹁獨立美術首途﹂　面是五個裸女正中的一個就是獨立美術的象徵了丶傍邊的兩個便是獨立美術的作家丶一個爲之被衣丶一個爲之戴裝秀飾之丶美麗之丶使之堂皇丶使之嬌艶丶紫色的背景丶我們自然可以覺得是高貴丶明眸引着脚步丶是找尋光明之路的丶其他數幅都是有很愉快的筆調丶單純的色彩丶並不複雜的構圖丶很可以値得我們鑑賞的丶</p>
<p>科學的機械的描寫福澤一郞是最顯明的一個丶無論畫面畫題都是謎般的滑稽丶譏諷人世丶比諭人生丶</p>
<p>魯阿是現代新野獸主義的最著者丶在這獨立美協展的作品中丶很多是與他的相近丶不成綫的筆畫丶狂顚般的調子丶表現了人世最美的醜惡丶里見勝藏氏的作是這樣相同的丶里見氏可以算是東方的魯阿了丶</p>
<p>川口軌外氏的作品是有詩歌情趣丶立體的綫幽靜裏發狂的調子丶不規矩的輪廓丶眞是會給我們看了在靜寂中打顫丶　　林武的作品其始也爲瑪提斯之影射丶現在的却走到瑪提斯氏的外廓了丶色彩是與之很清楚的分別的丶</p>
<p>尚有其他以林重義丶鈴本保德丶高昌達四郎丶鈴木亞夫丶······諸氏的作品都是很值得注意的丶都是新野獸羣在日本的先導者丶</p>
<p>獨立美展丶作品是在三千七百五十一幅選了二百七十一幅出來供我們鑑賞的丶這數看來不是濫選便可明白了丶</p>
<p>他們的努力的確是値得我國美術界所效倣的丶聞得國內的美術壇上非沈寂丶沈寂到如死一般丶這固然是國人的美術程度太淺丶對於美術太過藐視丶然別一方就要是美術界太不負責丶這是不能逃避的丶</p>
<p>我希望國人也至少倣倣人的努力丶</p>

<p>News Reporters Walk Out</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the seventh general meeting of the Internal Affairs Conference on the afternoon of the 23rd, when discussing the bandit suppression plan, Secretary-General Lei Xiaocen reported that the general meeting yesterday appointed ten members to draft detailed measures for this case. According to member Fan Guang's report, they are currently continuing to meet and study and plan to send the detailed measures directly to the General Headquarters without submitting them to the general meeting for discussion again. Fearing that once submitted to the general meeting for discussion, the newspapers would immediately publish them, leading to the leakage of the plan before the bandits are suppressed, which would be inappropriate. It was suggested that the general meeting should agree to this. After the report, member Gong Debai stood up and spoke, saying that in the past, regarding international news, there were non-nationalist news reporters who told foreign newspaper reporters to publish everything to their hearts' content. Who can guarantee that there are no communists in the room who will leak secret information? Therefore, this case should not be submitted to the general meeting. At that time, news reporters from various newspapers present felt that Gong's speech was too insulting to the personality of news reporters. To avoid suspicion, they stated the reasons for their withdrawal to Chairman Liu Shangqing and then all walked out. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Joint Association of Shanghai Newspaper Correspondents in Nanjing held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 5:00 PM on the 23rd to discuss how to respond to Gong Debai's public insult to the entire journalistic community at the Internal Affairs Conference.

<h3 id="e36">The French Cabinet Falls Again <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The French Radical Party's Steeg Cabinet has now suddenly announced its resignation. The reorganization of the French cabinet is like playing chess. There are few who can support it for several years without moving. Moreover, most of the French newspapers predicted that this Steeg Cabinet would not last long at the beginning of its formation, and now it has indeed been attacked and fallen due to the issue of increasing grain prices.</p>
<p>In terms of the political situation of Germany, England, and France, the difficulties faced by the French government in the political arena are not as great as those of the German and English governments. The opposition of the French political parties to their government is not as激昂 as that of the German and English political parties either. However, although the governments of Germany and England have repeatedly encountered major political difficulties and received fierce attacks in parliament, they often feel thorny for a time and can often turn danger into safety. Why does the French government fall due to small problems from time to time? There are two different points. One is because the German government has great constitutional power. The president has the power to deal with government orders in emergencies and the final relief for disputes in parliament, so the Brning Cabinet, even after the extremely serious impeachment by parliament, can still stand tall in the precarious storm with the support of the president, and will not fall suddenly due to external shocks. The other is due to the huge power of the British Labour Party. The foundation of the British Labour Party government is very solid. Although there have been small changes in the party recently, the belief has inevitably decreased slightly, but its power is still enough to deal with the opposition of the enemy party. The Conservative Party and others have repeatedly proposed no-confidence motions against the MacDonald Cabinet, attacking the government with all their strength, and ultimately being able to escape the dangerous situation. The fact that the Conservative Party passed an education amendment in the House of Commons yesterday, but MacDonald did not consider it a failure and resign, is one proof. The French government, legally, does not have such a large power as the German government, and politically, it does not have such a strong combination as the British Labour Party. Therefore, it is often unable to cope with even slightly difficult issues, which may be the reason why the French cabinet is so easily toppled.</p>

<p>Wheat policy fails in Parliament.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 22nd – The motion of censure on the wheat policy was debated today. The French government failed by a vote of 293 to 283, and the government decided to resign. Also, the French president has accepted the cabinet's resignation. Last week, the Minister of Agriculture, Bole, announced a wheat policy that included raising wheat prices to benefit farmers. The Undersecretary of the National Economic Department, Meyer, did not approve of this policy and discovered that although Bole's plan was announced last week, the Commercial Daily had already disclosed its plan in December last year, resulting in a major speculative trend in the wheat market. This is the reason for the government's failure. The motion of censure was proposed by Bouyard, who said that the Minister of Agriculture should not have announced it in advance, which led to speculative activities.</p>
<h3 id="e64">International Opium Conference <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>To be held in Siam in November of this year</p>
<p>Opium Investigation Team's report is inaccurate</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Kaisheng protests strongly</p>
<p>Difficult to mediate the dispute between Germany and Poland</p>
<p>Disarmament conference expected to be convened early</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 22nd – The International Administrative Council has accepted Siam's request and set the date for the Opium Smoking Conference to be held in Bangkok from November 1st to 10th. The Administrative Council passed the report of the Opium Smoking Investigation Team in the Far East, but China was not included in the investigation because the team did not receive a request from the Chinese government. The report stated that the illegal opium trade is an obstacle to completely eliminating opium smoking, but the smoking has slightly decreased in a few places where the crackdown is stricter. The League of Nations should do its best to assist governments in cracking down on illegal trade by restricting poppy cultivation and strictly preventing the smuggling of drugs and the illegal use of drugs. The Persian representative, Ali Khan, said that if the League of Nations could provide financial assistance, Persia would be willing to ban the cultivation of poppies. The Indian representative, Marshall, said that the Indian government has not yet received this report, but he personally agrees with it. The Chinese representative protested against the remarks in the report regarding the situation in mainland China, (National News Agency dispatch below) declaring that the committee members had never been to China and that the report was based on irresponsible rumors and solemnly stated that the Chinese government cannot be responsible for the various situations within the Western concessions. In addition, the Administrative Council held secret meetings in the morning and afternoon to discuss the more difficult issues of the chairman and location of the disarmament conference and the reconciliation of the dispute between Germany and Poland over ethnic minorities. The meetings were strictly guarded, and no representatives other than the chief representative and official translator were allowed to attend, so the content is unknown. It is rumored that the German-Polish dispute has reached a standstill, and the Polish representative is arguing that this is an internal affair and should not be interfered with by others, only willing to guarantee appropriate punishment for responsible officials and compensation for property losses suffered by German ethnic minorities. As for the disarmament conference issue, news did not leak out until three hours after the end of the secret meeting. It is unlikely that the chairman issue will be resolved at this Administrative Council session and will be left for future diplomatic negotiations. The date will be brought forward to January next year due to pressure from Germany and Italy. Lausanne is currently being considered as the location.</p>

<p>Emergency motion rejected</p>
<p>Issue of Prime Minister's deputy</p>
<p>Seiyukai has no opportunity to exploit</p>
<p>Yesterday's House of Representatives Plenary Session</p>
<p>Three Shi Zhongzao fiercely attacked the Minister of Finance</p>
<p>DPP councilors clamored for punishment</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd – Yesterday was the first day of the House of Representatives plenary session. Regarding the issue of the Prime Minister's deputy, Hatoyama, Yamazaki, and Makino of the Seiyukai Party stood at the forefront, originally intending to attack the Deputy Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara's fictitiousness with legal theory. If they could succeed, the DPP's steps would be disrupted and its absolute majority power could be reduced. Unexpectedly, the DPP was unexpectedly consolidated due to the Prime Minister Hamaguchi's discharge from the hospital. Only by this fear could they not exploit the government's weakness, so President Inukai also endured and restrained himself, causing him to lose the opportunity to disrupt. However, Hatoyama's speech was orderly, his attitude was calm, and he was able to maintain his sincerity, making it a very valuable speech. Deputy Prime Minister Shidehara's policy speech, although not as solemn as that of Prime Minister Hamaguchi, had considerable preparation for the reply to the deputy issue and was considered to have passed safely.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd – The House of Representatives plenary session after the recess opened at 2 PM yesterday afternoon amid extreme tension. At the outset, Speaker Fujisawa reported that fifteen members, including Mochizuki, had submitted an emergency motion to change the agenda to discuss a resolution on the application of the constitution before Deputy Prime Minister Shidehara's policy speech. He agreed to explain it, and then invited Hatoyama of the Seiyukai Party to take the stage. Hatoyama rose and spoke, generally saying that it was a violation of constitutional government for a non-party member to be a deputy Prime Minister and attend Parliament. At a time when the application of Japanese politics was gradually moving towards constitutional norms, there was this sudden reversal, which was regrettable. The foundation of the cabinet's existence lies in the Prime Minister, who is the president of a political party and can implement policies that are in accordance with the national agreement. If the Deputy Prime Minister is not a party member, he has neither the ability to implement policies nor is it easy to hold him accountable. In order to recognize the Deputy Prime Minister, the government cited Article 8 of the Cabinet Official System. Although this article does not explicitly state the duration of the deputy's term, it is necessary for the council to be responsible to the Parliament. If the deputy continues to act for a long period of time in Parliament, it cannot be regarded as illegal. Prime Minister Hamaguchi publicly stated various policies at the previous session of Parliament. To date, none of them have been implemented and are all deceiving the people. Now, he wants to question him, but he has not attended Parliament. If Deputy Prime Minister Shidehara cannot cope with it at all, he should know that the reply in Parliament is a major obligation of the Prime Minister. Today, the entire nation cannot recognize this "headless cabinet." He explained the purpose of submitting the motion and put it to a vote. As a result, 169 voted in favor, 245 voted against, and five members of the Proletarian Party abstained. The Seiyukai Party's motion was rejected by an absolute majority. Then there were Deputy Prime Minister Shidehara's policy speech and diplomatic speech, and Finance Minister Inoue's financial speech (see yesterday's newspaper). Yamazaki of the Seiyukai Party then took the stage to question the issue of the Deputy Prime Minister, which was quite effective and almost put Deputy Prime Minister Shidehara in a difficult position, earning very good reviews. The content of the question can be divided into several points: (1) During the tenure of the Deputy Prime Minister, whether the powers and responsibilities of Prime Minister Hamaguchi are suspended; (1) Whether the Deputy Prime Minister has the right to exercise all the duties of the Prime Minister; (1) Whether the Deputy Prime Minister's responsibility in state affairs is still borne by the Prime Minister. For the above points, please state the legal basis. Deputy Prime Minister Shidehara took the stage to answer, saying: (1) During the tenure of the Deputy Prime Minister, although the Prime Minister cannot exercise his powers, the nature of the Hamaguchi Cabinet has not changed, so the responsibility of the Hamaguchi Cabinet has not changed; (1) The Provisional Deputy Prime Minister naturally bears all the powers and responsibilities of the Prime Minister; In addition to the Provisional Deputy Prime Minister, he also intends to bear the responsibility for the state affairs of Prime Minister Hamaguchi before the appointment of the Deputy Prime Minister; (1) Regarding the responsibility of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Prime Minister is also naturally jointly responsible. This is my intention. Harasōhei of the Seiyukai Party took the stage and said that regarding the issue of the Deputy Prime Minister, he would like to ask Minister Koizumi, if the deputy is determined by the seat in the palace, then Minister of the Army Ugaki should be appointed as the deputy. However, the government appointed Shidehara as the deputy. What is the reason? Koizumi simply replied that it is not illegal for Foreign Minister Shidehara to be the Deputy Prime Minister. Hara continued to question Koizumi, and the DPP suddenly proposed a motion to extend the agenda. The meeting adjourned at 5:40 PM.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd – The House of Representatives convened at 1 PM today. At 1:10 PM, there were various reports. The three Shi of the Seiyukai Party, together with 亘, raised questions on the general situation of finance and economy, attacking the Minister of Finance. They first talked about the past observations of the financial community, and then discussed the mistakes of the government's administration, which led to a succession of unemployed, bankrupts, and failed businesses. They also mentioned the adverse effects of the government's optimistic financial outlook, the excessive estimate of tax revenue, and called it a fabrication. They also criticized the failure of the military reduction surplus bond policy. Finally, they also questioned the Minister of the Navy whether the supplementary plan completely maintained national defense. At this time, Ichimatsu Sadayoshi proposed a motion to punish Fujii and Fukazawa because they had deliberately made noise when the Speaker urged the 30 to pay attention during the speech of the three Shi. After Ichimatsu explained the motion, Fujii and Fukazawa rose up one after another to oppose it and requested that the motion be cancelled. As a result, Fujii and Fukazawa were referred to the punishment committee. The Minister of Finance took the stage to refute the questions of the three Shi, saying that their observation of the financial community was indeed wrong. The Minister of the Navy also took the stage to answer. The three Shi also took the stage to refute, and the Minister of Finance then made a simple reply on the debt reduction fund and bond issue.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd – The House of Peers plenary session convened at 10:10 AM this morning. First, Speaker Tokugawa reported on the matter of inquiring about Prime Minister Hamaguchi. Later, the agenda was changed, and the amendment to the Postal Law and the amendment to the Railway and Shipping Postal Navigation Law were included in the agenda. Minister Koizumi explained the reasons for the proposal. Tōenzushi submitted a motion to decide to entrust the committee with nine members appointed by the Speaker to deliberate. At 10:25 AM, Koiso Kichishichi took the stage to question the Deputy Prime Minister's belief on the issue of the command authority of the London Treaty. He also talked about the deterioration of students' thoughts, the reorganization of the former Minister of Education's plan, and the responsibility for the budget for the sixth year of Showa. The atmosphere in the venue was quite tense. The meeting adjourned at 11:50 AM.</p>

<p>Reuters, Nagpur, 22nd – 163 political prisoners were released from Nagpur prison today because the local government ordered the release of all those sentenced to imprisonment before January 30th last year. However, those detained under the Security Act were not included.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 22nd – Prime Minister MacDonald's declaration at the close of the Indian Round Table Conference is widely regarded as a major turning point in the situation, and the issue of political prisoners is expected to be re-examined. It is reported that the Governor-General is now keenly aware of the public's desire for peace and the moderate expression of the National Congress in temporarily postponing the publication of a reply to the Prime Minister's declaration in accordance with the advice of Sapru and others. Members of the Legislative Council said that to obtain concrete results, it is necessary to release more than a dozen important leaders such as Gandhi to facilitate discussions. As for the amnesty issue, it may be considered later. The Governor-General's Executive Council held an important meeting today. It is believed that the Executive Council has considered this matter.</p>

Approved.</p>

<p>Xiao Zhichu opened up Western Hubei after clearing Northern Hubei.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Honghu, which had been occupied by the Communists for two years, was subjected to a general offensive by the entire 10th Army starting on New Year's Day. After repeated breakthroughs of key passes, the bandit forces could not withstand the attack and began to collapse on the 10th. By the 18th, the bandits had been completely routed, and the 10th Army troops completely recovered Honghu the following day. Initially, the bandits occupied Honghu, building fortifications in Sanguandian and Bailuhu, attempting to resist stubbornly. Furthermore, the bandit leaders He Long and Kuang Jixun were fleeing from Hunan to Hubei. Near Shishou, Diaoxian, and Ouchi, there were large numbers of bandits stationed. The bandits affiliated with He Long and Kuang, such as Xun Zaiyang's group, led several thousand people, occupying Liujiachang, Xizhai, Jieheshi, Yanglinshi, Shadaoguan, Mijitai, Yuanshi, and Gongan County, causing great chaos. Therefore, the bandits in Honghu were completely unprepared. As the bandits He Long and Kuang fled to Hubei territory, the Hunan army's Li Jue unit and Dai Huiyuan's brigade immediately pursued and attacked. The 48th Division and the New 10th Division also deployed troops to intercept them. Attacked from both sides, He Long and Kuang were unable to connect with Honghu. The 48th Division then used the strength of six brigades to launch a general offensive against Honghu. Xu Jiwu's brigade first captured Sanguandian, Bailuhu, and other places. Zhang Zhenhan, Han Changjun, Xu Dezhuo, Liu Peixu, Rong Jingfang, and other brigades continued to advance. The bandits, without outside aid and having lost all the strategic points, had no fighting spirit. It is estimated that two to three thousand people were killed by the army, over one thousand were captured, over one thousand killed each other, and over one thousand fled. Therefore, the Communist Party's stronghold in Hubei, from which they issued orders, was captured by the government army. After Xu's brigade and others recovered Honghu, they ordered the burning of the false party headquarters, government, and reactionary propaganda. They immediately telegraphed Xu Yuanquan, the commander-in-chief of the 16th Route Army, for instructions. After receiving the telegram, Xu immediately sent a reply commending them and instructing them on three post-war measures: (1) In the cleared areas, a portion of the army should be responsible for handling the clear-up work together with the county magistrate and local mass organizations. (2) A portion of the army should be dispatched to pursue and suppress the bandits who fled from Honghu day and night to eliminate the roots. (3) The areas near Honghu that are still occupied by the bandits must be wiped out within a time limit. After receiving the order, Xu and other brigade commanders are actively proceeding in different directions. The pursuit troops have reached Yuyangguan, Liujiachang, Xizhai, and other places, and have contacted Dai Huiyuan and Zhou Xieqing and Deng Nanxun's units of the Hunan army at Shimen and Daquanzhi. They will launch a general offensive against He Long and Kuang's bandit forces. It is heard that He Long and Kuang's remaining bandits, after being severely attacked by the Hunan and Hubei armies, hope to flee back to Shihe's old nest. Guo Yun's unit of the Sichuan army rushed to Songzi, Yidu, and Zhijiang to block them. They defeated the majority of the bandits at Liujiachang, and they fled back to Sangzhi and Dayong. Guo ordered the Su militia to defend Wufeng County, and the Yang militia to station in Changyang and Yidu, and contacted Li Xiang's brigade to prevent them from fleeing back to Hubei territory. Liu Xiang, the commander-in-chief of the 7th Route Army, also sent Luo Qijiang's unit to garrison the border between Sichuan and Hubei to prevent them from fleeing to Sichuan. The large armies of each province have completed their communication and surrounded He Long and Kuang's two units. It is estimated that it can be resolved in a few days. As for Chu's unit of the 44th Division, which was originally designated to garrison Western Hubei, was ordered to suppress the bandits because of the rampant communist bandits in Northern Hubei. Now it has cleared up the remaining bandits in the Huang'an area. It is heard that it will still open up Western Hubei to garrison, and search and suppress the remaining bandits with Xu Yuanquan's 48th Division. (January 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e74">The 19th Route Army Sends Reinforcements to Jiangxi <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Departing from the 17th, they will travel in four batches to Shaozhou and then transfer to Dayu. The front has dispatched Ma's brigade and Deng's regiment south to Dayu to meet them. Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the two divisions of the 19th Route Army, led by Cai Tingkai and Dai Ji, arrived in Xingguo and Yudu in Jiangxi, they are about to launch a large-scale encirclement of the communist bandits in western Jiangxi. It will be difficult to proceed in the future without substantially strengthening their strength and replenishing ammunition. Therefore, after Cai's division arrived in Ganzhou and Yudu, they sent troops to open the road from Ganzhou to Dayu on the Guangdong border in preparation for receiving supplies. The senior officers of the 19th Route Army, such as Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, made various replenishment plans in Guangzhou. For the 60th Division, there are two special service battalions and five new soldier training teams, totaling more than 1,800 people, preparing to depart in Guangdong. For the 61st Division, there are three special service battalions and five new soldier training teams. The new soldiers in each team were equipped with full arms on the 16th. The Yuehan Railway Bureau was also ordered to prepare vehicles daily, sufficient to transport a regiment of soldiers, stationed at the Huangsha Railway Station awaiting orders. On the 17th, the first batch of troops took a special train north at noon, including four companies of the Second Independent Battalion of the 61st Division, led by Zhong Ding, about 600 people, hundreds of boxes of rifle ammunition, and a company of logistical troops of the 60th Division, more than 200 new soldiers, led by Pang Cheng, the commander of the 13th Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the 61st Division, on a special train of 15 vehicles. They arrived in Shaoguan on the evening of the 17th. On the 18th, a second batch of troops departed. It was found to be about 600 people from the Third Independent Battalion of the 61st Division and about 600 people from the First Independent Battalion of the 60th Division, totaling 1,200 people, led by Battalion Commander Luo Zaoshi, who arrived in Shaozhou at about 4 pm on the 18th. As for the third batch, it included the Special Service Battalion of the 9th Brigade of the 61st Division, led by Zhang Yan, the commander of the 9th Brigade, accompanied by Luo Ding, the director of the new army training, who took a train north on the 19th. Chen Xinlu, the chief of staff of the 60th Division, Ye Shaoquan, the director of the business office, Chen Quan, the chief of the military law office, and dozens of staff members of the two divisions stationed in the Jinghan area, and about 600 people from the Second Special Service Battalion of the 60th Division, led by Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 60th Division, are scheduled to take a train to Shaozhou on the 20th. After each batch of troops arrived in Shaoguan, they did not stay and immediately advanced to Nanxiong and concentrated in Dayu, waiting for the 19th Route Army in Ganzhou to send a team to connect with them. According to the front-line telegram, the 60th Division and the 61st Division sent out various battalions of replenishment regiments and Deng Zhicai's regiment on the 15th to move from Ganzhou south to meet them. Once Deng's regiment arrives in Dayu, the new recruits and officers from Guangdong who arrive in Nanxiong will meet and go to Ganzhou. At the same time, in order to ensure the plan, the 19th Route Army dispatched Ma Kun's brigade south to clear up the remaining bandits between Nan'an and Dayu, and dispatched teams to defend the area, consolidating the border defense between Guangdong and Jiangxi. It is heard that the reinforcements sent from Guangdong to Jiangxi this time brought 400,000 yuan in silver for the two divisions, 20,000 sets of cotton clothes, and 600 boxes of ammunition, which will be sent to Xingguo and distributed to the soldiers at the front. The Public Security Bureau here has hired 300 coolies to escort the military supplies along the way, and they are expected to arrive at their destination around the 25th or 26th. (January 18th)</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The newly appointed Director of the Jiaoji Railway, Ge Guangting, arrived in Qingdao by the No. 2 train at 9:00 AM today (the 20th). The various committee members and the heads of each department of the railway, as well as representatives from various agencies, went to the station to welcome him.

Ge went to the office to inspect matters this afternoon. The official oath of office is scheduled for the 26th. Ge told visitors that after the Ministry of Railways announced his appointment as the director of the Jiaoji Railway, he originally planned to come to Qingdao to take office immediately, but the affairs of the Jinghan Railway Bureau still needed to be handed over. After arriving in Tianjin, he also had some contact with Deputy Commander Zhang, so he delayed for many days. He said that this time he came to Qingdao without a clear understanding of the internal situation and affairs of the Jiaoji Railway. He added that it is not convenient to announce the railway's ongoing plans and rectification policies until he has consulted with the committee members. (January 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Tragic Decline of Changchun's Commerce <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Affected as Severely as the Provincial Capital by the Plummeting Value of Paper Money</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Provincial Government Appealing for Relief</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Changchun, a vital town in the Northeast and the meeting point of the three railways – the Chinese Eastern, South Manchurian, and Jichang – boasts convenient transportation and was renowned for its thriving commerce. Since the surge in the price of gold, it has suffered significant losses. Recently, the official notes of Jilin Province, the main currency, have plummeted in value, inflicting even more severe wounds. The market is in turmoil, making it almost impossible to sustain. The Manchurian Railway-occupied areas in Toutaogou are becoming commercial wastelands, and the situation is even worse in the commercial districts and within the city. The Changchun market is affected by the falling prices of grains and the tightening of credit. Many businesses, both large and small, have been closing down in recent days. Apart from grain merchants and pawnshops, the majority of businesses in the city are retail shops. The price of their goods is mainly based on the Yongheng official notes as the primary currency. However, gold tickets (Japanese gold) are essential for importing foreign goods from places like Osaka, Japan. When purchasing domestic goods from various ports in Tianjin and Shanghai and remitting payments, banknotes (Japanese silver) are used for circulation. In previous years, when new grains came onto the market, grain merchants competed to buy grains and beans, transporting them to Dalian and exchanging them for banknotes to circulate in the market. Therefore, the price of gold and banknotes gradually decreased every winter. However, after the autumn harvest last year, the sale of grains and beans to Dalian was sluggish, preventing grain merchants from purchasing and transporting them, resulting in a lack of banknote sources. Merchants needing gold and banknotes to remit payments had no choice but to buy them, leading to a supply shortage. Consequently, the price of gold and banknotes increased daily, while the official notes depreciated, further tightening the monetary situation. Businesses, with limited capital, found it insufficient for circulation and resorted to borrowing from Chinese and foreign banks at high interest rates. According to investigations, the Bank of Chosen alone loaned approximately three million yuan in gold and banknotes to businesses in the city. State and local banks loaned approximately seven million silver dollars. Currently, the lending institutions, fearing that borrowers will go bankrupt and suffer losses, have stopped lending and are aggressively collecting existing loans. With limited income from sales and external debts being demanded, borrowers have no choice but to declare bankruptcy. Moreover, each loan requires guarantees from two or more guarantors. If the borrower cannot fulfill the repayment obligations, the lenders will inevitably demand payment from the guarantors, who, unable to bear the responsibility, will also have to declare bankruptcy. Therefore, the bankruptcy of one business inevitably leads to the collapse of many others. Recently, as many as fifty-six businesses, large and small, have been affected by this chain reaction. Those that have not yet collapsed are struggling to survive, with no guarantee of making it to the next day. If no measures are taken to provide relief, there is a risk of a complete collapse by the end of the year. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, responsible for protecting businesses, could not remain silent in the face of such a dire situation. Therefore, on the thirteenth of this month, it detailed the actual situation in telegrams to the Jilin Provincial Government and the Agricultural and Mining Bureau, which also oversees industry and commerce, appealing for relief. They requested the Yongheng Official Bank to promptly sell a large amount of banknotes to stabilize the financial situation and pleaded for the ample disbursement of loans to rescue the crisis. It remains to be seen how the authorities will respond. (January 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Anhui Province Reduces Rice Passport Fees and Tax Rates <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Export Rice Actually Levied at Four Jiao per Stone</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After the abolition of Likin in Anhui Province, a rice export passport fee was established. The business community, considering it of great importance to the province's commerce, not only telegraphed the National Government and the Provincial Government requesting its abolition, but also dispatched Wu Xingzhou, chairman of the Provincial Federation of Commerce and chairman of the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce, and Tang Xiaoquan, representatives of the Wuhu Guangdong-Chaozhou and Yanning rice industries, along with nine others, to Anqing to personally present the situation regarding the impact of rice passport fees on commerce to the Provincial Government. They met with Chen Diaoyuan, chairman of the Provincial Government, and Yuan Jiapu, director of the Department of Finance, several times, arguing that after the abolition of Likin in Anhui Province, military and administrative expenses were insufficient by 13.5 million yuan. If no measures were taken to offset this, the Provincial Government would have no choice but to close its doors. All Anhui people had a joint responsibility to maintain the province. The industry had already planned thoroughly, calculating that rice export fees could generate 3.5 million yuan annually, salt surcharge of 2.4 yuan could generate more than 2 million yuan, Weitian increase could generate about 8 million yuan, and business tax could generate about 500,000 yuan. These were all unavoidable measures that had to be implemented. Moreover, for the sake of the province's food supply, rice exports could not be allowed without proper investigation and unlimited exports. The representatives repeatedly requested and negotiated with Director Yuan, who finally agreed to reduce the fee by two jiao, actually levying four jiao per stone for export. The representatives, seeing no other option, returned on the Jiang'an steamer this morning and will convene another meeting to discuss the plan. The 500,000 to 600,000 stones of rice previously concentrated in the port have already been registered for export at the rice passport fee general inspection office because the iron steamships of various groups have been waiting for a long time. Furthermore, rice merchants transporting rice by sail from Lu and He and the six counties of Anqing, as well as Nanling and Yicheng, considered rice passports to be of great importance for transportation within the province. Zhang Jiesan, Li Youren, and Yuan Zhongyi have been selected as representatives to telegraph the Provincial Government, requesting special consideration, and have initiated the organization of the Anhui Province Sail Transport Rice Merchants United Maintenance Business Association, which is scheduled to be established in Wuhu to maintain business operations.</p>
<p>This time, with the nationwide implementation of Likin abolition, the usual customs posts within fifty li were also to be abolished. The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce previously organized a review committee for the usual customs posts and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting early abolition to relieve the distress of merchants in Jiangsu. Now, a reply has been received from the Ministry of Finance stating that it must wait until a comprehensive plan is developed before a decision can be made. Therefore, the Chamber held another meeting today and unanimously agreed that the usual customs posts were detrimental to businesses, and unless they were abolished, commerce would never be revived. It was decided to re-telegraph the National Government and the Ministry of Finance, based on the previous request, urging the early abolition of the usual customs posts within fifty li. The Anhui Provincial Federation of Commerce, due to the implementation of business taxes in Jiangsu Province after the Likin abolition, which were ten times higher than the original outline, and with Anhui Province about to implement business taxes, to avoid repeating the same mistake, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that commercial organizations be allowed to participate in the formulation of new taxes. The telegram is as follows: "The new taxes to offset Likin abolition are a special consumption tax in the national treasury and a business tax in the provincial treasury. During the Likin abolition conference, outlines were established to give merchants an opportunity to express their opinions, so as not to repeat the old Likin system, where the tax commissioner had sole authority. Recently, according to newspaper reports, the business tax implemented in Jiangsu Province is ten times higher than the original outline, and it is also heard that the unified tax on yarn factories has been increased to four or five times the original rate. If all provinces follow this new example, the outlines will become mere formalities, and the arbitrary increase of burdens is not the original intention of the state to abolish Likin and eliminate the detrimental policies that harm businesses. It is hoped that you will review the third item of the special consumption tax outline and the fifth article of the business tax outline, and allow commercial organizations to contribute their opinions when formulating new taxes,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>so as not to lose the original intention of the law and to ensure that the new taxes can be implemented without obstruction. We hope you will consider and adopt this." (January 21st)</p>

<p>Detailed Account of the Robbery and Kidnapping Case in Jiang Village, Punan: Jiang Village in Punan is located six li west of Shanyang, and is six li from remote small towns like Malan Dian and Shanyang Xupu, and just one li from closer ones. The market in the town is declining, but it serves as a hiding place for bandits, so it has been robbed three times in the past two years. It has been learned that at 12:00 pm on the 20th, more than 30 bandits speaking with both local and out-of-town accents suddenly arrived, carrying four quick-firing guns and eight Mauser pistols. They divided into several groups to carry out the robbery. Bandits were stationed in the town to guard and set up sentries. All merchants in the town were robbed, and Xie Zichun, a doctor in the town, and the children of Mr. Tan, the owner of the Yi Ji Nanhua store, were kidnapped, as well as the son of Qi Ziyu and the son of Zhang Heng from the countryside, and a peasant. At dawn, they escorted the six hostages in three boats, carrying the loot and fleeing towards the Dianshan River area. At that time, a police team stationed at Mazha sent out a sentry, who encountered the bandits in Dianshan while patrolling from a neighboring town. They immediately opened fire to suppress them. At the same time, the Xihutang defense corps also heard the gunfire and rushed to the scene, surrounding and attacking the bandits. The fighting was fierce. Many bandits were killed and wounded, and they abandoned the hostages and fled. When the bandits tried to rob the Qi Ziyu family in the countryside, the Qi family had weapons for self-defense and fought the bandits once. At night, when everyone was quiet, the sound of gunfire was heard in the towns, and they prepared for defense. The police team and defense corps came together to attack quickly. The hostages were completely rescued. It was all thanks to the courage of the corps and police.</p>
<p>Police and Corps Capture Bandits and Escort Them to the County for Interrogation: The County Magistrate and the County Clearing Bureau today received four bandits, Wu Yintang, Jiang Awu, Jiang Ali, and Ma Shaoquan, who were escorted to the county by the police team and defense corps stationed in Shanyang. After interrogation, except for Ma Shaoquan, who claimed that he was implicated because his nephew was a thief, Wu Yintang and the other three admitted to robbing Xin Street, Dianshan, and other places, and provided the names of the remaining bandits. They were imprisoned and interrogated, and the bandits were investigated.</p>

The sentry sent out by the armed unit caught a glimpse of them and immediately summoned the residents to beat the gongs and gather the crowd, while running back to report to the unit for departure. By that time, the bandits had already heard the sound of the gongs and returned to their boats and fled, so they were not robbed.</p>

Later, Age caught one of the robbers, who was found to be a local villager named Aju. Nearby residents intervened and returned the money. (2) Mr. Zhu, an employee of the Minfeng Silk Factory outside the South Gate, took a streetcar home to his private residence in Taiping Lane outside the Guangfu Gate last night. When he passed Huangtiandang, he was suddenly attacked by three thugs who robbed him of the fur coat he was wearing. Afterwards, the police from the 3rd Public Security Bureau dispatched police officers to arrest the three thugs and bring them to the bureau. However, Mr. Zhu, regardless of the resentment he would incur, requested the bureau to release them, which Director Wang approved. (3) A few bandits also came to the home of Jin Xiaosu, a resident of Chengjiao, outside the North Gate last night and carried out a robbery (some say they entered gently but left violently), resulting in significant losses. (4) Zhai A'er from Xinghua intended to snatch the gold ring worn on the ear of Zou Anong, the daughter of Zou Yongsan, on Xiangshang, 4th District (Kaiyuan Township), yesterday. She was spotted by women Zou Yao, Yuan Li, etc., who immediately twisted Zhai A'er and sent him to the 9th Public Security Bureau for transfer to the General Bureau for interrogation according to law.</p>

<p>The Dispute Over the Feast Donation Has Not Yet Been Resolved: The restaurant industry of Wuyi County unanimously opposed the collection of donation money by the Feast Donation Collection Office. From the strike to the resumption of business, representatives of the Tingcai restaurant industry petitioned the party and government organs. The county government ordered the representatives to submit the requested methods for review within three days, but the representatives have not submitted any methods. The Education Bureau has also submitted a petition to the county, accusing the restaurant industry of refusing to pay the donation. On the 22nd, Magistrate Zhang ordered the police to summon six representatives of the restaurant industry, Zhu Jinsheng, Wang Hongsheng, Cai Fusheng, Wang Zirong, Shen Jinsheng, and Li Quanchang, to the county government. Wu, the section chief of the Second Section, spoke to the representatives and ordered them to provide a certificate of compliance with the normal agency collection of donation money, so as to notify the Collection Office to check the accounts and collect donations at each restaurant. The representatives refused. Section Chief Wu then gave a face-to-face instruction. In the evening, Magistrate Zhang, Director Liu of the Public Security Bureau, Director Lin of the Finance Bureau, lawyer Yun Kuiyao of the Chamber of Commerce, etc., met at the Dacheng Hotel to discuss the matter. Magistrate Zhang said that the six representatives were willing to provide a certificate of payment, so they could be released. The restaurant industry still refused. Finally, the leaders of the agencies scheduled a meeting at the county government on the 23rd to discuss and resolve the issue. The six representatives were being held in the Political and Police Waiting for Trial Office.</p>
<p>A Kidnapping Case Occurs in the Fifth District: Xu Denghua, the deputy chief of Wangjia Village, Wanjia Township, Fifth District of Wuyi County, was suddenly attacked by more than 20 bandits, each holding firearms, who searched each room and robbed them of all their clothes, jewelry, and cash. After the robbery, they kidnapped his second son, Xu Xiaowan, and left in the same way, leaving a case demanding 5,000 yuan, to be sent to the Sanhuang Temple for redemption.</p>
<p>A Murder and Robbery Case Occurs in the Eastern Suburbs: Shi Zilin of Shijia Village near Baijia Bridge outside the East Gate of Wuyi County was well-off. He had just finished his son Susheng's wedding on the 13th of the old calendar month. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 pm on the 20th, more than 10 armed bandits suddenly arrived and first twisted and held Wang Shi Zilin, extorting silver dollars. When he refused, they nailed a file down from Zilin's head, causing his brains to flow out and killing him. Zilin's wife was also severely beaten.

About a li away, a painter bandit stubbornly resisted and was shot and killed by the police, and his body was abandoned on the roadside.</p>

<p>The Verdict of the Jiangdu Prison Break Case: During the Mid-Autumn Festival of the old calendar last year, 48 detainees escaped from the Jiangdu County Court Detention Center. Later, the High Court commissioned a special investigator to find that the personnel in charge of the detention center were suspected of facilitating the escape. The director of the detention center, Chen Quan, and the director of security, Liu Baichuan, as well as the guards, Jiang Qisheng, Zhou Wenbiao, Lu Dingyuan, Shi Dianwen, Lu Damaozi, Wang Jiren, Tu Guilin, Chen Shulin, Cheng Liuxing, Wei Liben, and Tao Guisen, a total of 13 people, were brought to court for investigation and all detained. Chen Quan and Liu Baichuan were released on bail due to illness. Later, upon the order of the High Court, the case was transferred to the Zhenjiang Court for trial. Chen and Liu were again summoned to court. Chen again used illness as an excuse for not attending. Prosecutor Zhou questioned them one by one and conducted multiple investigations. Shi Dianwen, Jiang Qisheng, and Lu Dingyuan were found to have no criminal suspicion in this case and were released. The remaining nine people, including Liu Baichuan, were suspected of facilitating the escape for eight reasons, and one piece of evidence was used to prosecute the Criminal Court. The case had been openly tried and had been concluded. The verdict was announced at 2:00 pm on the 22nd. Liu Baichuan, Zhou Wenbiao, Chen Shulin, Tu Guilin, Cheng Liuxing, Tao Guisen, Wei Liben, Lu Damaozi, and Wang Jiren were found guilty of facilitating the escape and each sentenced to five years of imprisonment. After the reading of the verdict, they were ordered to be returned to custody. Liu and others claimed that they did not accept the verdict and intended to appeal.

<p>Recent News of the Northern Relocation of the Salt Transport Office: Although the counties and groups in northern Huai have repeatedly appealed for the relocation of the Salt Transport Office to northern Huai, they have never succeeded. Recently, reliable news from Beijing has revealed that the relocation is inevitable. No matter what requests are made, it will be impossible to reverse the decision. However, all taxes will be temporarily collected in Yangzhou. The education, charity, and police surtaxes that have been collected in the past will remain the same. The audit office will not be relocated with the Salt Transport Office. The Huainan Anti-Smuggling Bureau will not be abolished for the time being. The Yangzi Salt Depot will be relocated from Twelve Forts to Yangzhou and its organization will be expanded. The Salt Deputy will be changed from Huabei to Huainan and located in the same city as the Yangzi Salt Depot. Then, the transition from sailing ships to steamship transport will be gradually made. The transition from paying taxes in Yangzhou to collecting them on-site is being made. Although the people of northern Huai do not ask for it, it is actually not easy to change everything at once. It is also heard that the newly appointed Salt Transport Commissioner Wang has assigned four members, Ye, Tan, Wang, and Zhang, to go to Guanyun to take over the Huabei Salt Deputy first. Then, the Huabei Salt Deputy will send personnel to Yangzhou to organize the Huainan Salt Deputy. It is estimated that the procedures for the above-mentioned handover, organization, and relocation will take a month to complete.</p>

<p>Bandit Harassment Strikes Again: Two Incidents in Pinghu's Countryside. At Qianmei Village's Juloutang in Pinghu, on the 21st, around 8 PM, four bandit boats arrived, towed by a small steamer. Over 30 bandits, armed with rapid-fire guns and Mauser pistols, stormed into the homes of Fan Awu and Fan Sanhe, looting rice and clothing worth about 500 yuan, and injuring Awu's son, Xiaoliu. Also, in Xincang South Xiele Bridge in the eastern countryside, Tang Erdi, a musician, was extorted for 3,000 yuan by the bandit Liu Dexing earlier in the month. Tang's family fled to avoid payment, angering the bandits. On the 21st, several bandits went to Tang's house, carrying rice straw into the house and setting it on fire. The ancestral hall was already ablaze, threatening the entire house. Neighbors pleaded with the bandits repeatedly, and the fire was finally extinguished. However, the bandits threatened to return and burn the house again if Tang did not quickly pay the money.</p>
<p>Commander Shen Narrowly Escapes Bandit Capture: Commander Shen of the 7th Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force went to Xincang Town in eastern Pinghu on the 20th to inspect defenses and gathered soldiers of the 11th Company stationed there for a briefing. On the 21st, he took a small steamer he had procured back to Pinghu, escorted by a platoon of soldiers from the 11th Company. Upon reaching Guangchen Town, Shen instructed the escorting soldiers to return to Xincang. He continued in the steamer with a Mr. He, a staff member from the regimental headquarters, and several soldiers. Near Banlu Bridge, several bandit boats suddenly blocked their path, and bandits boarded Shen's steamer. One soldier was tied up, and another was knocked into the water. Commander Shen's insignia was torn off by the bandits. Fortunately, the bandits could not read, so Shen claimed to be a salt affairs official, narrowly escaping harm. The bandits severely beat Shen and Mr. He before releasing them, stealing over 80 yuan in cash that Shen had with him. A Pinghu water police officer, acting as Shen's guide, jumped into the river and swam away to escape. Mr. He's injuries were serious, while Shen's were lighter. On the 22nd, they arrived in Pinghu together to see a doctor at the hospital, and Shen returned to Hangzhou in the afternoon. The water police and security forces dispatched troops and police to Banlu Bridge to search for the bandits, but they had already fled.</p>

It has been learned that the administration ordered dozens of workers to drive stakes, erect poles, and fill earthwork there the day before yesterday, planning to use approximately fifty mu of land in total. However, local residents, believing that the land is privately owned and has not been purchased, protested the excavation, causing considerable disturbance.

Also, the Nongxie Associations in Dongcao and Tongji, and other townships extorted three sheng of rice per mu as membership fees, which also led to accusations from the public.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department Inspection Meeting was held at 2 PM on January 21st. Attendees included Chen Hexian, Yang Naikang, Xiang Shaoxuan, Zhou Yuxin, Xiang Zitan, Cao Shutian, Li Jiahan, Yu Qingtang, and Liu Shaozhen (as a representative). Hou Bingji and Huang Shaohong were absent due to illness. The meeting was chaired by Department Head Chen Hexian, with Huang Shaohong as the recorder. The chair respectfully read Premier Sun Yat-sen's last testament.</p>
<p>Items for Discussion: 1. Whether district inspectors assigned to various counties but not yet inspecting should be assigned a date for inspection. Resolution: The inspection departure date is set for February 20th, the inspection completion date is set for the end of March, and the report submission date is set for the end of April. 2. How should the eleven counties not yet assigned for inspection be divided? Resolution: (1) The Department will first issue orders to the counties to prepare for the inspectors' visits; (2) The distribution of responsibilities for each county will be decided by the inspectors based on local conditions. Inspector Cao will be responsible for Suining and Suqian Counties; Inspector Xiang will be responsible for Tongshan and Pi Counties; Inspector Yi will be responsible for Donghai, Guanyun, and Gan Yu Counties; Inspector Zhou will be responsible for Feng County, Pei County, Xiao County, Dangshan and other counties. 3. Whether the 19th year's educational expenditures in each county were indeed implemented in accordance with the approved budget. 4. For counties with accumulated educational expense deficits, the inspectors should be requested to consult with the county government and convene the finance and education bureaus to jointly discuss a clearing method in accordance with the Department's regulations. 5. Whether the economic audit committees of educational institutions in each county have been organized and whether monthly income and expenditures have been submitted to the full committee for review. In addition to the Department revising the regulations and issuing separate orders for compliance, the inspectors should pay attention to the matter. The above three items were discussed together. Resolution: Each inspector should conduct a strict investigation and urge implementation. For those counties under inspection that have not yet established economic audit committees and debt clearing committees, the fourth section should create a list and submit it to each inspector, and the Department should order each county to comply. 6. Please inspect the actual work status of local educational instructors from the provincial elementary schools at any time. 7. Please assess whether each county education bureau has submitted and approved the 19th year's administrative plan for implementation. The above two items were discussed together. Resolution: The inspectors should assess and urge compliance during their visits to the counties, ensuring thorough compliance. 8. Is there a need to implement the high school consolidation plan? 9. Should the junior high school reform focus on cultivating low-level agricultural and industrial improvement talents? 10. Should the final year of higher elementary school emphasize vocational skills? The above three items were discussed together. Resolution: A discussion of the joint plans will occur after the inspectors have completed their inspections and submitted their overall reports. 11. Many internal staff members of the county education bureaus hold more than two positions (such as inspectors doubling as section chiefs, or education committee members doubling as section members). Should this be observed at any time to avoid negligence? Resolution: The Department will draft remedies and submit them to the Provincial Government for approval and circulation for compliance. 12. How should the basic educational ideology of principals and teachers be assessed to determine its purity? 13. How should elementary school teachers' research on multi-grade teaching methods and self-cultivation methods be enriched? 14. All private secondary schools in each county, whether registered or unregistered, should be inspected strictly. 15. Should elementary schools with few students that insist on offering complete elementary education be strictly banned, given that only a few students are in the fifth and sixth grades, resulting in significant expenses? The above four items were discussed together. Resolution: Regarding correcting ideological aspects, each inspector should conduct a strict assessment and urge each school to use textbooks that have been reviewed. If there are still unsatisfactory textbooks, they should be submitted to the Ministry of Education for correction. Unreviewed textbooks and those with impure ideologies should not be used under any circumstances. As for those who do not understand teaching methods and private schools that are not registered, as well as those that cannot operate complete elementary schools, they should be assessed, urged, and banned at any time. 16. Printing inspection reports is proposed to be published in four phases. Resolution: (1) The first and second phases should be published first, and the third and fourth phases should be printed after the inspection is completed, along with an overall conclusion. (2) The editorial style of the publications should be handled by Hou and the book club in consultation with the inspectors.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Last Night's Basketball Game: Northeast Defeats Labor University Again <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-Six to Nineteen</p>
<p>Labor University Performs Admirably Despite Defeat</p>
<p>Northeast University Wins Fourth Time</p>
<p>Tomorrow Night at 7 PM: Battle with Zhonggong</p>
<p>The Northeastern University basketball team, which has been winning consecutively, met Labor University at the Chinese Basketball Hall last night. The result was a score of thirty-six to nineteen, marking the fourth victory for Northeastern University since arriving in Shanghai. Labor University put up fierce resistance in the first half, with Northeastern University only winning by two points, earning them a lot of applause. Unfortunately, Labor University's stamina faltered later, leading to their defeat. The referee was Shu Hong.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Never Relax, Labor University is Formidable <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The performance of both teams in the first half of last night's game was extremely exciting. Labor University's skills have improved significantly. Although Northeastern University is strong, they could not find a way to beat Labor University. The score fluctuated constantly, and there were several ties. Labor University closely guarded Northeastern University's forward, Yuan Tingrui, making it difficult for him to move, which was unexpected. At the sound of the referee's whistle, the two teams collided and ran back and forth, holding each other to a draw several times. Yuan Tingrui's long shot finally broke the deadlock, but Labor University's Song Jinhai also scored one point due to Zhao Zhizhi's foul. Yuan Tingrui scored again, giving Northeastern University a 5-1 lead. However, Labor University, with excellent coordination, tied the score. Northeastern University scored again, and Labor University also scored, bringing the score to seven-seven and nine-nine, with no winner in sight. The entire stadium was tense. Labor University unexpectedly scored, taking the lead with 11-9.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Changing Tactics, Northeast University Finds a Turning Point <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Finding no progress, Northeast University called for a timeout and changed their tactics. They realized that rushing too quickly would inevitably lead to chaos, and Yuan Tingrui's movements were restricted due to the close marking, making it necessary to change their strategy. They proceeded cautiously, avoiding reckless shots and instead adjusting their defenders to attack. Sure enough, Ma Bingjun broke free, tying the score at 11-11. Once this tactic was successful, they tried again and scored again. In the first half, Northeastern University won over Labor University by two points, with a score of 13-11.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Take it Slow, Northeast University Wins Again <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Knowing that a fierce attack would be futile and even detrimental, Northeastern University maintained the previous strategy from the beginning of the second half, with the defenders moving forward and Yuan Tingrui taking the opportunity to attack. Northeastern University won one victory after another, and Labor University was trapped by their strategy, falling behind by 11-25. From then on, they were severely demoralized and unable to recover.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Stamina Declines, Labor University Loses <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Labor University's strength in the first half followed by weakness in the second half was mainly due to a lack of stamina. The close marking was also less effective in the second half than in the first half, and with the change in the situation, panic appeared. They became increasingly anxious when attacking, resulting in many missed opportunities, which was a pity. Looking back at the first half, one cannot help but feel a sense of regret over the difference in strength. The final score was 36-19, with Northeastern University winning.</p>

<p>|3-3 Ends in a Draw|</p>
<p>The situation of the Jinan soccer team's expedition to the Philippines, which is famous at home and abroad, has already been recorded in our newspaper's previous dispatch. Having arrived in Manila for the past two or three days, they have had several practice sessions and have gained an understanding of the terrain on the battlefield. On the afternoon of January 15th, at 4 o'clock, for their first official match, our team, riding on the momentum of their three-time championship in the Jiangnan soccer scene and their recent winning streak against the Westerners' soccer team in Shanghai, were naturally eager to fight and expected to defeat the enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e106">La Salle's Achievements in the Philippines <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>La Salle Athletic Club is also known throughout the Philippines for its strong combat power. The team's players have three years of experience in cooperation. The players are all alumni of the school, forming an elite organization, and two of them have attended the Far Eastern Games (one is the Iron General guarding the door). The team won the first place in the 1930 Manila Athletic Association's Group A championship. In September of last year, they joined the soccer association organized by the Spanish sports community in the city, and as a result, they tied for first place with another soccer team. They also won second place in the All-Philippine University Soccer Tournament last year. The team's historical record is enough to be proud of. This match is no ordinary match, and they have also enlisted their former alumnus, the current captain of the Spanish soccer team, Minzhisu Na, as the right guard, to consolidate their strength. They also intend to compete with the Jinan team to determine who is superior.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Valiant Athletes Take to the Field <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The venue was in the Carnival soccer stadium. The turnout for this event was huge, especially among the overseas Chinese. By 3 o'clock, the area outside the stadium was crowded with traffic. The prime seats, valued at one dollar, were all taken by 4 o'clock, and spectators were still surging in to buy tickets, reminiscent of the old Lehua scene. It is estimated that there were more than 3,000 spectators, with overseas Chinese accounting for seven or eight tenths (foreigners usually don't finish work until 5 o'clock), which shows their enthusiasm for supporting Jinan. Then, the athletes from both teams took to the field. The Jinan team members wore blue shirts, white pants, and orange-black striped socks, looking valiant and spirited as they took the field. The members of both teams also wore a white-green color scheme, showing their bravery. At half past four, the judges tossed a coin to choose the goal, and the captains of both teams presented flowers to each other and shook hands to show respect. Then, Lu Se, a local enthusiast of sports, performed the opening ceremony, and with the sound of the silver whistle, the battle began.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Two Teams Compete, Displaying Divine Power <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The ball was kicked by Lucesus towards the Jianan left inside forward. The opposing team, taking advantage of the situation, pressed in with the ball. Halfway there, it was intercepted by our center half, Zhuang Shihong, who passed it to the right wing, Mei Hongbao. Mei then advanced along the sideline, but was entangled by the opposing left back. All the opposing forwards arrived, but fortunately, our center back defended effectively, preventing them from capitalizing. Soon after, Dai Linjing took a shot straight at the goal, but it was stubbornly resisted by the opposing right back, who then launched a counter-attack. Fortunately, Chen Zhenhe, Feng Yunyou, and Jiang Shanjing bravely defended, preventing defeat. This was the situation in the first ten minutes of the match. Later, Mei Hongbao received a pass from Dai Linjing and struck with all his might. The audience applauded loudly, expecting the ball to rush straight into the goal, but it missed by just over five inches, hitting the crossbar. They missed the opportunity to score first, much to the regret of the audience.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Penalty Kick Scores a Goal <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>After our team missed the opportunity to score, the opposing team became very active. The right forward received a pass from the back and dribbled straight in, shooting from seven or eight yards outside the goal. Liang Guanlian had not yet recovered from his illness, feeling heavy-headed and unsteady on his feet, unable to make the save. This allowed the opposing team to open the scoring. The Westerners cheered wildly, but fortunately there were not many of them, so their momentum was not overwhelming. Soon, the opposing team surged again, and the right wing kicked in another goal. The force of the attack was truly unexpected by the audience. At this time, our team realized that the opponents were not to be taken lightly, so they rallied their spirits and changed their strategy. Chen Zhenhe was positioned as the center back, running and supporting all areas. They tried to shoot at the opponent's goal several times, but all were blocked by the opposing goalkeeper. For example, Dai Linjing displayed his long-range shooting skills, aiming directly at the goal, but it was saved and rebounded by the goalkeeper. As our team pressed into the opposing territory, the opposing team forcefully collided with our players, resulting in a penalty kick. Chen Zhenhe kicked it in, and our team finally opened the scoring. At this time, the overseas Chinese who were worried about the Jianan team showed a slight smile, hoping that they could take advantage of this momentum and turn defeat into victory. However, the opposing team worked even harder to charge at our goal, and the opposing right forward scored another goal from the left. The first half ended with a score of one to three, which was a great surprise to our overseas Chinese compatriots.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Changing Formation, Morale Greatly Boosted <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The whistle blew again, and the teams reorganized to continue the match. On our team, the right center back on the central defensive line was replaced by Shutang. Chen Zhenhe remained as the center back, and Zhuang Shihong played as the left center back. Each player displayed great power, and the formation showed great improvement. Our players tirelessly ran around the opponent's goal, but it was as if one man was guarding the gate, like a mud seal on Hangu Pass, and they could not find a way in. Fortunately, the opposing team committed another foul, resulting in a free kick. Dai Linjing took the kick, and the ball went diagonally into the right corner, scoring directly.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Chen Zhenhe's Hard Work and Great Contributions <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Our team's formation gradually gained the upper hand, and with the cheers and encouragement of the crowd, Dai Linjing approached the goal and kicked in a goal. However, the referee ruled that the ball had already gone out of bounds and the goal was invalid. However, the players did not lose heart because of this, and continued their efforts. Chen Zhenhe received a cross from Mei Hongbao and bravely headed the ball powerfully. The ball was no match and retreated into the net, leaving the iron general (goalkeeper) helpless, amazed as if a flying general had descended from the sky. Ying Kao Shu's seizing of the banner to be the first to ascend, Little Black Charcoal (Chen Zhenhe) can be said to have made great contributions with his hard work! After our team tied the score, they took advantage of the momentum to attack. In five minutes, our team fired a series of shots at the goal, but all were blocked by the iron gate, just like General Fu's staunch defense of Zhuozhou City, ultimately preventing the enemy from crossing the line. However, time was not on our side, and the end of the match was announced.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Cheers and Sighs <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The anxious overseas Chinese audience were comforted that the Jianan team had finally turned the corner and managed to avoid defeat. When the forwards dribbled the ball and launched fierce attacks, they all cheered and encouraged them, hoping for a final victory. When their efforts fell short, they sighed together. Cheers and sighs alternated in quick succession. In an instant, the crowd shared the same fluctuating emotions of joy and sorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Jianan Alumni Public Banquet <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>At seven o'clock that night, the Jianan Alumni Association in the Philippines held a public banquet for the players at the Datong Club, with representatives from the press and education circles as guests. After the meal, Chairman Yang Guobiao announced the warm welcome, and Chen Zhang'e and other team leaders announced the purpose of the trip. They also invited Lin Xijin, president of the Education Association, Lan Jixian, representative of the Tongwen School Alumni Association in the Philippines, Yan Wenchu, principal of the Zhongxi School, and Wang Quansheng, principal of the Puzhi School, to give speeches. They all expressed infinite hope for the players and offered encouragement.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Organizing a Women's Cheerleading Squad <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>During the banquet, Yu Yonggu, a staff member of the General Chamber of Commerce, proposed that since this sports competition was related to the international standing, cheering and encouragement were indispensable parts of the competition. Therefore, an orderly organization should be established, and women, in particular, could most easily encourage the players to work hard. The proposal was unanimously approved by the meeting, and Yu Guyong was elected to discuss with the director of the Charity Federation about free admission for the cheerleading squad. Wang Quansheng was asked to negotiate with the Overseas Chinese Girls' School and the First Girls' School to select female students to join the cheerleading squad. If this proposal could be realized, the competition on Sunday would be even more interesting.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Reminiscing About Li Huitang During the Banquet <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Philippine team's goalkeeper, Garcia, had repeatedly attended the Far Eastern Games and was known as the "Iron Gate". However, he was most afraid of Li Huitang. As soon as Li Huitang's ball arrived, he would be at a loss, just like a fierce lion showing its power, even tigers would lose their courage. There was much discussion about this during the banquet.</p>

<p>Result: 55 to 26</p>
<p>The Zhenru Basketball Team, comprised of the elite players from Jianan and Chizhi, came south with the football team, eager to showcase their skills. On the 16th night, at the Malila Baseball Stadium, they played their first official match against the All-Philippine University Basketball Team champions of 1930, the All-Philippine United Team. In front of over two thousand spectators, they managed to amaze everyone, winning by a large margin of 55 to 26. Having won the first match, their spirit was greatly boosted, and continued victories can be predicted. The situation on that day is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e118">Audience Psychology <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Regardless of the Chinese or Filipinos, the general consensus was that football was our country's special skill. In past Far Eastern Games, we have won many championships. The Jianan football team, being a rising force, dominated the Central Plains. This time coming to the Philippines, they were sure to win by a large margin. On the other hand, basketball was the special skill of the Filipinos, renowned in the Far East for over twenty years. Bringing a Chinese team here, being able to draw each match would be considered lucky. Who would have known that judging from the situation these past two days, the reality would be very different.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Pre-match Entertainment <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Before the two basketball teams took to the court, there was a performance by the women's volleyball team, the University of the Philippines against the Normal School. This entertainment by the women's team gave the audience a lot of fun. The two sides had equal wins and losses, ending in a draw. Next, the Overseas Chinese Zhuguang Team played against the National University Team. The Zhuguang Team was organized by the enthusiastic sports enthusiast Mr. Lin Zhuguang. They have a long history of training, having attended the Wuchang National Games and traveled to Japan and the Americas. Their strength is indeed the strongest among the Overseas Chinese teams. After the offensive and defensive competition between the two sides, the result was 48 to 45, serving as a small prelude to the main competition.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Clash of the Two Armies <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>After the entertainment ended, the main event began. The players of the two teams successively took to the court. The Zhenru team members were all spirited and extraordinarily agile, with their bright uniforms of blue vests and shorts, and the words "Zhenru Basketball Team" emblazoned on their chests. The Philippine side wore gray vests and red shorts, and their physiques were equally formidable. Furthermore, their well-known forward, F. Marians, who has been a leading player in the Far East for several years, also participated, making their strength not to be underestimated. With the sound of the silver whistle, the players roared and leaped into fierce battle.</p>
<h3 id="e121">A Blow to the Head <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>As soon as the formation was set, our player Kong Guangyi was penalized for bravely stealing the ball. Fortunately, the opponent failed to score. Not long after the match started, the opponent was also penalized for their right forward violating the rules. Wei Haiqing scored on both attempts, worthy of being called Feng Xian's (Lu Bu) archery, never missing. Taking advantage of this victory, they pressed the opponent. However, the opponent was not to be underestimated. They had several skillful passes, which were defended by our backs Kong Guangyi and Zhang Qiying. Huang Chuanlin displayed his elusive skills, shooting the ball into the basket, earning a lot of applause. In these five minutes, our team scored five points, while the opponent had zero, something the Philippine team never expected, and surprising the audience.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Hanging the "No Battle" Sign <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After this setback, the Filipino side's Marians, who was known for his hundreds of victories, launched a brave offensive. Zhang Qiying defended him, just like Zhang Yide (Zhang Fei) fighting Xu Chu. Our side was penalized for being too brave, and the opponent scored on both shots, regaining some face. Going further, they were also penalized, and Huang Zhaolin scored. Wei Haiqing also received a quick pass from the back and relayed it to Yang Linyu, who then shot the ball in from long range. At this point, the Filipino side hung the "no battle" sign, requesting a temporary break.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Continuing Efforts <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>In a short period of time, the Filipino side held a military conference, changing their strategy, thinking of using a surprise attack to gain victory. However, our army's copper walls and iron walls had no openings to exploit. Wei Haiqing once again used his hundred-step piercing Yang (shooting) skills to achieve miraculous success. The Filipino side also had a free throw opportunity at this time, scoring another goal. At this time, the fierce general Yang was injured and Cai General was called in to replace him. The opposing side also brought in fresh troops to join the battle. In the continued battle, the fierce general Huang Zhaolin scored another goal, with the opposing Marians also scoring a goal. Huang Zhaolin, lying in ambush under the basket, also scored a goal, using his hands to lift it in, using close combat to win. In the midst of this tense battle, both sides passed the ball extremely skillfully, displaying their skills. However, because of the high level of our team's skills, the opponent could not figure them out. Therefore, at the end of the first half, our team won with 27 points to the Filipino side's 11.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Final Victory <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, our side, encouraged by the victory, strengthened our formation. The forwards and backs cooperated seamlessly, advancing and retreating with ease. The opponent had long-range shooting skills, but ultimately lacked the power to score. Our army's Huang, Wei, and Cai attacked again and again, all hitting the mark, going smoothly, and achieving remarkable results. As a result, our team scored 55 points, while the opponent scored 26 points, thus achieving a great victory.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Merit After the Victory <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>After the Battle of Red Cliffs, when Cao's army was defeated, Huang Hansheng was at the top of the list for merit, with 24 points. Cai Rongrui had 11 points, Wei Haiqing had 8 points, and Kong Guangyi and Zhang Qiying each had 4 points. The remaining are still under investigation and will be announced later. The Zhenru team lineup is as follows: "Inside Guards" Kong Guangyi, Xia Zeren, Zhang Qiying "Forwards" Cai Rongrui, Yang Linyu, Wei Haiqing, Huang Zhaolin</p>

<h3 id="e128">After Participating in the "Welcome Western Kang Compatriots" Meeting <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Juan Jiu</p>
<p>Recently, the news that has attracted the most attention is the arrival of the Western Kang student delegation in Shanghai. On the 18th of the month, seven organizations in Shanghai jointly held a welcome meeting. During the meeting, formalities were followed. Zheng Tonghe, the principal of Shanghai Middle School, presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech, which was divided into three points: (1) Since the founding of the Republic, there have been repeated wars, and unification has not been achieved. Therefore, successive governments have failed to pay attention to border affairs. Now that the national government is unified, it is planning and designing. The Western Kang class that has been trained has graduated. From now on, there will be people to transform Western Kang. (2) Western Kang is located on the border, and transportation is lagging behind. People in the country initially do not know its customs and habits. For example, the book "Strange Tales of Western Travels" mostly insults women in the Sichuan border region. Now, please let the people of Western Kang explain the truth to dispel doubts. (3) Western Kang is located next to Yunnan in the past, and then Qinghai, Tibet to the left, and Sichuan to the right. It has a close relationship with the whole country, but everything remains silent and in ruins as before. Now that these students have come out, Kang affairs may be promising. Next, Pan Yangyao, the representative of the China Vocational Education Society's Border Promotion Association, delivered a speech, also with three other points of significance, carrying the strong color of expanding vocational guidance education to the border areas in the welcome. Then, Sheng Cheng, who had successfully studied in Europe for ten years on a work-study program, gave a speech on the evolution of pastoral life and residential life, and the importance of our nation restoring pastoral life. Mr. Sheng spoke with the demeanor of a professor, unpredictable attitude, and lively tone, earning a lot of applause. Next, Tian Huijin, a professor at Northeastern University, recounted the general situation of municipal administration in various European and American countries. At this point, the Shanghai Middle School harmonica team played, refreshing the audience's nerves. Then, Lu Shunong, the instructor of the delegation, gave a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Ice Fish Revival Method <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>·Ji· Jin</p>
<p>In the bitter cold of winter, ice fish are sometimes found in the market. They do not eat or move, and are almost dead. If you cut them open and look, their hearts are still beating and their blood is fresh and not clotted. In fact, they have not died. My friend Mr. Li, who is a researcher in physics, first uses boiled and cooled water for the experiment. Slightly effervescent, he puts it in a container and adds a small amount of ice. After waiting for the temperature to gradually decrease, he then puts the fish in. After some time, it completely freezes. The fish is still motionless. Then he increases the temperature or exposes it to sunlight. The thick ice gradually melts after several days. When it has melted to a certain degree, the fish gradually returns to its original state and can swim freely. According to him, any frozen fish, even if it has been frozen for half a month, can still be revived. The most important thing is that when water turns into ice and ice turns into water, the rate of change in temperature should not be too rapid. The fish's ability to revive depends entirely on this slow effect. These are his words, and I would like to ask wise physicists for their comments.</p>
<p>He also reported on the educational policy of the class and the implementation of the past. Then, Yang Zhonghua, a student representative of the delegation, reported on the political, educational, industrial, and commercial conditions in Western Kang, as well as the monetary system and other situations, and the process of coming to study. He also mentioned a Western Kang folk tale of a mixed-race father with five sons, to symbolize that the five races should unite and unite to save the country, and that they had suffered from the explicit and implicit oppression of various imperialists in the past. Now that they have come south, it is like a little brother coming to find an older brother, saying, "Older brother, the foreign devils are beating me." His voice and expression were tragic, making people feel both emotional and excited, both sad and happy. Next, He Lixi, a female student from the delegation who was fifteen or sixteen years old, reported on the past and present lives of women in Western Kang, and that she and her friend Bo Zhixi would return to Kang in the future to start with education and awaken women in Western Kang as their vocation. The lady has lived in Peiping for a long time, is lively in demeanor, and speaks Mandarin very fluently. Her speech was also concise and to the point. Finally, five or six of the male students of the group performed Kang dance and Tibetan music, including (Knowing Sound Song) Zangye Quzha Jiacuo by the ancient musician Quzha Jiacuo, and (Social Dance) A Ma Le Si, (God of Flowers) Bai Mei Baiduo, and (Welcome Song) La Da Xi Bei, etc. First, two people stood shoulder to shoulder and hugged each other, advancing and retreating, and touching their left feet back and forth as if kissing. Later, many people stood apart, rotating and advancing and retreating left and right, corresponding to the singing. As for the tunes, they were strangely harsh. As for the lyrics, they were twisted and difficult, and the listeners did not understand them.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Reminiscences of Mr. Chu Minyi's Words <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>

<p>Some time ago, the Chinese Harmonica Association held a tea party for members at the Hua An Building on the eighth floor. Over a hundred people attended. In addition to the fun and entertainment, there were also speeches by Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Chu Minyi, and Chen Heqin. Because Mr. Chu's topic was "Music and Physical Education," he spoke in great detail. Because Mr. Chu was a hygienist and a physical educator, he was able to explain everything thoroughly. Now, I will record the main points to inform those who study music and physical education. Mr. Chu said that the harmonica is the best instrument in music. It is cheap, easy to learn, and convenient, unlike Western instruments, which cost dozens or hundreds of yuan and take several years to master. As for the role of music in life, it has been with us since birth. A newborn can cry, which is its music and its physical education, because crying can expand the lungs. Mothers often see their babies crying and feed them with milk, which is actually a very unhealthy practice and should be strictly avoided. Also, there is a world of difference between the physique of Chinese and Western performers. Famous European and American performers know a lot about hygiene, so their dantian is full and their voices are loud. They can be on stage for a very long time, without any fatigue from beginning to end. On the other hand, Chinese famous performers often have bad habits, their bodies are weak, their voices are low, and they are accompanied by very loud instruments, and the time is short, which cannot create an orderly atmosphere for the audience. Although Chinese and Western dramas are different in nature and structure, the strength of the performers' bodies is very important. Therefore, studying music also requires attention to physical education. Chinese singing emphasizes the dantian, and Tai Chi also emphasizes the dantian. The dantian seems to be the diaphragm. In order to make the lungs move, it is necessary to expand not only to the left and right, but also up and down. These are all physical education issues. Now, if we hold a harmonica and blow it slowly in the morning and evening, it is enough to easily expand the lungs, and it may be an aid to physical education, not just entertainment.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Proverbs About Sheep <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>

<p>A few days ago, I read "Xin Wei New Dictionary" by Mei Hua Guan Zhu, which was very interesting. I couldn't help but feel itchy and wrote a few sheep proverbs to amuse myself.</p>
<p>Good luck and prosperity is a common saying. According to the ancient meaning of the character 羊 (sheep), it means auspiciousness.</p>
<p>"Sheep's foot bones" is a Hangzhou dialect term for firewood that is small and flimsy. Calling it "sheep's foot bones" is to imply that it is not enough to be used as fuel.</p>
<p>Lamb and fine wine are both excellent products. This means that there are delicacies and mellow wine, just right for light drinking and low conversation.</p>
<p>"A sheep falls into a tiger's mouth" This metaphor refers to the weak encountering the strong and violent, like a sheep falling into a tiger's mouth, with no escape.</p>
<p>"Learning three parts of sheep epilepsy" There is a folk saying that learning three parts of sheep epilepsy is good enough to earn a living.</p>
<p>"Selling lamb as dog meat" This refers to someone who urgently wants to sell goods for money and sells them at a low price.</p>
<p>"Getting a body full of sheep stench" Those who are caught in a whirlpool or want to seek benefits but end up with no real benefit often say, "I didn't eat the lamb, but I got a body full of stench."</p>
<p>"The wool comes from the sheep's body" This means that the cost of goods is high, and the selling price will naturally increase accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Strange News About Wax Figures Playing Chess <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>

<p>In modern times, science is flourishing, and wise people do not talk about magical things. If the following were discovered in a time when science was not clear, cunning people would use it as a rare commodity to deceive ignorant villagers. This kind of art is an optical effect, and is based on the same principle as mirages, but it is only the difference between natural and man-made, and it is not worth mentioning. The other day, my friend returned from Paris. We were chatting at his hotel when he happened to mention a strange event in Paris. He said that there was a Go club where players had to bet money to play, but they always lost. The chess master was made of wax, and his face, hands, and feet were no different from a living person. The owner of the club first disassembled the wax figure to show the guests that there was nothing inside its hollow abdomen. When playing chess, when the guest made a move, the wax figure also made a move. The result was that the guest always lost and the wax figure won. It was strange enough that the wax figure could play chess, but it was even stranger that it never lost. Later, someone found out the secret. It was said that several chess masters were gathered upstairs in the club. Many mirrors were hung next to the chessboard, which could reflect light to the upstairs. The chess masters upstairs could see every move the guests made. They then used electricity to move the wax figure. So it was not the wax figure that was winning, but the chess masters. That was why it was invincible. Many people who heard about it were curious and flocked to it. The owner of the club made a fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Rambling Notes from the Shanghai Bund <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Song Lu</p>
<p>I have returned to Shanghai. Several months have passed again. Old friends are scattered, and the world is full of changes. Quietly observing the ten-mile foreign concessions, the prosperity is even more different than before, and the novelty of things is also progressing with each year. I dip my brush to record these impressions, as a way to express my feelings.</p>
<p>If you want to know the development of material civilization, you only need to look at the transportation. When I first arrived in Shanghai, I had a lot of luggage. So, I ordered my servant to hail a yellow car to carry it. Upon arriving at the destination, I asked the price. One yuan was enough. Stable, fast, and cheap, nothing could surpass it. From this one aspect alone, one can see the convenience of transportation in Shanghai. Material prosperity has its origins.</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper, I was surprised to see the so-called First Credit Insurance Company. I was astonished by the novelty of its business. So, I asked for its details. It is also like other insurance businesses that charge annual fees. But the premium is particularly high, requiring 2% of the annual value (i.e., an insurance of 10,000 yuan requires a prepaid premium of 200 yuan). Nowadays, there are too many people and too few jobs in Shanghai, and finding insurance is indeed as difficult as the company described. However, if an employee with an annual income of 400 yuan must guarantee an amount of 10,000 yuan, then half of their annual salary would be used to pay the insurance premium.</p>
<p>Tired of reading, I took a nap. Suddenly, I was awakened by a shouting sound. Listening to it, it seemed to be someone collecting dregs from opium pipe heads. I was curious about the name. Asking a colleague, he said, "It is the water residue from boiling opium paste." I asked what it was used for. He said it would be used to feed the opium addicts. Alas, making a living in Shanghai is truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>Huang Cuojiu, a prominent figure in Shanghai, has passed away. Huang's merits and demerits in life will have their own evaluation. I will not repeat them here. However, Huang loved scholars and was eager for talent throughout his life, which is especially commendable today. As far as I know, people such as Shushisheng of Shanghai, Shannong of Tiantai Mountain, Qizishanren, Yingchuan Qiushui, Xu Tianma, and Wu Yu Gong Xu Hangsu, all had the friendship of guests with Huang. Sun Yusheng and Liu Shannong were especially respected by Huang. Huang was originally just an ordinary merchant. Looking at his life, the only things he relied on to achieve great success were his ability to observe the times and recognize people. Huang was generous, valued integrity, and liked to help people in need. Whenever someone asked for something, he always readily agreed. His good deeds were also commendable.</p>
<p>News from the silver screen: Since the popularity of sound films, most of the major cinemas in Shanghai have switched to showing sound films. Only the Paris Cinema on Avenue Joffre, which specializes in showing first-class silent films, can still stand out. Last Sunday, the cinema held a trial screening of "Reckless" starring Greta Garbo, inviting more than a hundred members of the press. From beginning to end, the film is not only known for its romance and glamour, but Garbo is also able to fully express the pain of a second love. When she wants to leave but also wants to stay, her expression, which is neither crying nor laughing, is even more moving. As for the elegance of the background and the uniformity of the supporting actors, these are just secondary matters. It is heard that the film has been officially released in the cinema since the 21st. (Sheng Pu)</p>
<h3 id="e134">Parisian Tales (X) (II) <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Liu Ceng, residing in Paris</p>
<p>(II) Donogoo</p>
<p>Among the new plays recently staged in Paris this year, the one that has attracted the most attention and discussion from theater critics is "Donogoo," a recent work by Jules Romains.</p>
<p>Romains is currently a first-class poet and playwright in France. He specializes in studying the complex collective psychology of the "Unanimist School" (Ecole unanime). He has also written several novels, such as "The Death of Someone" (La mort de quelqu'un) and "Lucienne," which are very famous. However, his most beneficial success in the literary world is his play "Knock" (Knock Le Trlomphe de la medesineo). "Knock" is a comedy that specializes in satirizing doctors. He exposes the insidious tricks of many modern unscrupulous doctors who use the beautiful name of science to scare the public, turning healthy people into sick ones. His attitude of challenging doctors is simply in line with the great French 17th-century comedy writer Moliere. However, his satire is even more venomous than Moliere's. Although "Knock" was fiercely opposed by medical associations in various places after its premiere, the general audience praised it extraordinarily. The box office success was rare in the last decade.</p>
<p>This "Donogoo," which premiered this year, cannot be entirely considered a new work. Ten years ago, Romains used this theme to write a screenplay published in Nouvelle Revue Francaise. This time, it was just changed into a stage play. But a few months ago, when news and theater advertisements revealed that "Donogoo" would be rehearsed at the Pigalle Theater (Theatre Pigalle), those who were fond of drama were already looking forward to it, treating it as a rare piece of news, as a major change in the theatrical world. Why is this? One reason is that Romains has a great reputation. Second, although the recently renovated organ stage of the Pigalle Theater, where "Donogoo" is rehearsed, cannot be said to be the best in the world, it can at least be considered the newest and largest in Paris. Third, the premiere of "Donogoo" can give a glimpse of whether stage drama will eventually be eliminated by film.</p>

<p>Market Overview At present, the foreign li is in a stagnant sales situation, and there is no possibility of gradual increase. Only in the recent few days, the trend of buying and selling seems to be more buying and less selling, causing most multi-party sides to inevitably wait and see, resulting in a slightly clever outcome. However, observing the general trend, there will be no soaring actions.

<p>The yarn market is very firm, with a sharp upward trend, mainly because the trend of foreign cotton is good, and it is difficult for exchange rates to rise for a long time. Most people's psychology is that the price of imported goods is high. The combined silver price of three-grade yarn is more than 200 taels. Therefore, manufacturers and gold merchants have been absorbing large quantities in the futures market for several days. As a result, the standard yarn market has risen step by step. However, according to the general trend, there is still room for appreciation in the short term. The sales of existing yarn in the market are more active. If it can continue to develop, the future may be promising. However, most sellers are still watching wearily.</p>
<p>The human standard rose by 2 taels. The opening price of the foreign standard in the pre-market was based on the fact that American cotton had risen again. The number of buyers in the market increased. Rongxing purchased on a disk-by-disk basis, all without price limits. As a result, the upward momentum was so strong that it was unbearable. As a result, the near term rose by 1 tael and 2 mace, and the distant term rose by 2 taels. In the afternoon, the buying momentum in the market was still strong and the market atmosphere was still tight. This month, it rose by 1 tael and 2 mace in the near term and 9 mace in the distant term. Statistics for the whole day's transactions totaled 65,300 piculs. It was found that the selling was Gongtai 1,850 bales, Tongxing 1,350 bales, Gengfeng 1,000 bales, Senkang 1,250 bales, Changfeng 2,900 bales, and Yichang 1,050 bales. The buying was Meiji 1,500 bales, Rongxing 8,100 bales, Xincheng 1,950 bales, and Tianchang 1,250 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton market's upward trend is becoming increasingly intense. The continuous rise in American cotton prices and the prospect of further increases have boosted confidence, drawing eager buyers. Many short sellers, recognizing the unfavorable environment, are forced to cover their positions, and large purchases by gold dealers have further tightened the market. Cotton trading is currently active, and market sentiment is noticeably buoyant.</p>
<p>Hanbiao Extremely Buoyant. The Hanbiao market opened with American cotton prices continuing to rise, resulting in strong buying interest. Prices increased by two to three cents in early trading, and the tight market conditions led to further gains of five to six cents in the second and third sessions. The upward momentum persisted into the afternoon, with prices rising another five fen to two cents. Total daily trading volume reached 155,600 bales. Sales included 5,000 bales from Shenchang, 30 bales from Tianchang, and 3,400 bales from Yongchang. Purchases included 6,300 bales by Rongxing, 6,100 bales by Yongfeng, 4,800 bales by Dafeng, 6,200 bales by Changfeng, 4,000 bales by Guangdong, 3,200 bales by Daji, and 3,600 bales by Yiyu.

<p>American Cotton Eagerly Covered. Yesterday, positive news from Liverpool spurred short covering in American cotton. Active buying led to a steady market, with futures prices rising by 8 to 16 points and spot prices up 10 points. British cotton futures increased by 9 to 11 points, and spot prices rose by 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices increased by 15 points. Indian cotton was supported by purchases from Japanese and Indian brokers, with Pingguo'er falling 3 rupees, forward contracts unchanged, Oomra unchanged, forward contracts up 2 rupees, and White Broach up 2 rupees.

<h3 id="e143">Grain and Rice Market Continues Downward Trend <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei. Yesterday, arrivals at various wharves were substantial, reaching around 80 vessels. Current river inventory is approximately 230 vessels. Sales remain sluggish. Special Grade White Keng rice is still offered at 13.9 yuan, but ordinary rice is priced around 13 yuan. The market sentiment is weak. Sales of thin Indica rice are also slow, with prices falling by nearly a dime. Premium Grade Yangxian rice is still offered at 12.7-12.8 yuan, with limited retail interest and no significant market activity. The price of Du Bu jian tong rice is stable, while inferior grades are struggling at various yuan levels, with sales matching. The situation is considered stable.</p>
<p>South Shanghai. Yesterday, 30 vessels arrived at the riverbank. Sales were slow. Changshu and Beikeng rice prices are continuing to decline, with the top price at 13 yuan. Suzhou and Tongji Keng rice buying interest is also quiet, and sales are not expanding. Transactions are limited, and various Keng rice prices are down by one or two dimes. Arrivals and sales of Southern Route thin early rice are sluggish, falling by a dime. Yang Du jian rice market also lacks vitality, with prices barely holding at previous levels. Baiyuan rice remains mediocre, and alcohol sales are stagnant, similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Flour Prices Slightly Firmer in the Evening Market <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market opened weak in the morning for all months. The lowest price for the current month reached 2.095 taels. However, as factories were largely taking a wait-and-see approach and external selling pressure did not intensify, the market stabilized. In the afternoon session, the gold price rose again, naturally causing foreign exchange rates to decline. Selling pressure was therefore minimal. Many speculative short positions were also covered, seemingly stabilizing the market. Given the current circumstances, the spot price for the current month is not strong (military supply spot prices need 2.175 taels), so a significant price decline seems unlikely. However, if the factories also have excess flour, the ultimate downward pressure will come from this factor. As a result, the current month fell slightly by 0.005 taels compared to the previous day, February rose by 0.0075 taels, March rose by 0.01 taels, April rose by 0.0075 taels, May rose by 0.01 taels, and June rose by 0.005 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Forward Wheat Tends to Weaken <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a generally flat to weak trend for all months in both the morning and afternoon sessions. With delivery of the current month approaching, both longs and shorts are gradually liquidating positions. The trading volume on the exchange was still over 200 cars, but the actual delivery will probably be within 100 cars, and a portion has already been settled bilaterally beforehand. Therefore, there are no major issues overall. For the far-month contracts, foreign quotations only showed slight fluctuations, and the amount of margin on the exchange was steadily dumped by market participants, causing market sentiment to be difficult to boost. As a result, the current month was up 0.01 taels from the previous day, February was down 0.01, March was down 0.01, April was down 0.01, May was down 0.02, and June was down 0.03 taels. Spot wheat is still unquoted due to limited arrivals and sales.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Grey Cloth Price Falls by Five Cents <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's grey cloth market was severely dampened by a sudden softening of Yuan Fang's quoted prices. Those who had strong buying intentions in the morning session largely stopped. Actual sales were also hesitant. Prices shifted from rising to falling, with grey cloth falling by about five cents. Sassoon 9 was quoted at 11.75 taels, Deji 9 at 11.25 taels. Sassoon Red Butterfly and French government silk were also flat. However, Dong Huo's top-grade Zhigong wool remained firm and expensive, with Lie Yan at 3.9 cents and Mogan Shan at 3.85 cents. Bottom-grade goods were slightly lower, with Shuang Tong Deer at 3.25 cents, willing to be sold, and San You Tu at 2.175 cents. Yuehua velvet was also down by 0.025 cents. Cotton velvet, due to increasing spot inventory, Yang Guifei's Fei Se color returned to 2.2 cents. Niao Meiren's Big Red was at 2.25 cents. Fine Serge was still firm. Top-grade Zhigong satin was sold at 3.425 cents. Dark blue Ding's spot goods were scarce, with agents from Changsha purchasing 30-40 pieces yesterday at a price of 2.4 cents. Mingxing wool also saw increased purchases, with Da Quma stripes selling for 3.85 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Dried Goods, Dried Longan, and Land Prices Rebound <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Source Increasingly Scarce</p>
<p>Quanzhou Large Dried Longan. Sales here have recently decreased, and prices have turned flat. However, high-quality goods are indeed scarce, and only approximately 300 boxes arrived yesterday. Therefore, the market trend has rebounded. If land prices are used as a benchmark, top-grade goods from Zhuang must be near 32 taels, and there are currently few competitors. Sales will likely improve after year-end.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Seafood and Mushroom Market Turns Tight <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Previously, Xiang Gu mushrooms' market had gradually declined due to weak sales to customers and thick inventories. Recently, street-level and domestic business has suddenly become active, and inventory is gradually thinning. Additionally, it is rumored that the new crop yield from various areas is not as abundant as last year. Therefore, merchants are generally unwilling to sell their inventory quickly, causing the market trend to tighten. Yesterday, Tunxi firms offered 21 pieces of new goods. High-grade large pieces were priced at 203.5 taels, ordinary goods at 191-186.5 taels, and 37 pieces of old goods were priced at 140-129.5 taels. Merchants are still interested, and the market trend seems to have the potential to continue rising.</p>

<p>Medium-Grade Cocoons Require 900 Taels</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai white silk factories have seen active demand from Europe and the United States, causing prices to rise. However, raw materials are scarce, and the dry cocoon market has become increasingly profitable. Merchants holding surplus cocoons are all raising prices to profit. Yesterday, Shanghai Beiji silk factories bought 104 dans of Wuxi medium-grade dry cocoons. The cocoon cost approximately 900 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Shanghai Factory Products Increasingly Popular <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>European and American silk merchants are relentlessly buying Shanghai white factory silk. However, the factory's inventory is insufficient to meet demand, causing the market to become increasingly popular. Yesterday, Mitsui and others imported 40 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, and Taihe and others imported 20 packages of white dry silk. Prices have risen sharply.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Needle Eyebrow Tea Rises Sharply by Five or Six Taels <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms in the local tea market continued to show strong interest in imported needle eyebrow green tea from Ying Zhuang, Jinlong, Tongfu, Xiehe, and Tianyu, but inventories were low, boosting market confidence. Prices rose sharply by five or six taels. Xiubrow and Zhu tea were also expected to become slightly firmer. However, Zhenmei green tea still lacked significant sales, and the market trend gradually declined. The Gongxi market also became quiet, and the Russian Association announced another suspension, resulting in a pessimistic outlook.</p>

<p>Ma Xiaojun and Wu Tingyang Arrive Together</p>
<p>Chen Shi Proceeds to Beijing Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Huang and Others to Rest Briefly in Shanghai</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, former Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 am aboard the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Shinyo Maru from Hong Kong. Accompanying them were Wu Tingyang, former Director of the Guangxi Provincial Government's Department of Construction, Ma Xiaojun, Chief Counselor of the General Headquarters, Chen Shi, Counselor, and Gong Jieyuan, a total of six people. The Shinyo Maru was originally scheduled to arrive in port on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, but due to fog, it was anchored in the Tongsha waters, delaying its arrival at the Wusong Estuary until 6:00 am yesterday and reaching Shanghai at 8:00 am. It docked at the Huishan Wharf at 8:20 am. Welcoming them at the port were Deng Jiayan, former Secretary-General of the Eighth Route Army, and dozens of Huang's family members and friends.</p>
<p>Meeting with Reporters. After the ship docked, welcomers and reporters from various newspapers boarded the ship to pay their respects. Mr. Huang, dressed in a black suit, was energetic and came out to meet them personally, shaking hands with each welcomer. He then met with reporters from various newspapers in the reception room, introduced by Deng Jiayan. Mr. Huang answered the reporters' questions in detail, speaking for about fifteen minutes before the reporters took their leave.</p>
<p>Mission to Beijing. Mr. Huang said, "I am here on the orders of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the details of Guangxi Province. There are areas where the Central Government is unclear about the situation in Guangxi, and I can explain them in person. The Central Government will decide on the follow-up issues in Guangxi, and I have no objections. The war in Guangxi has long since ended. The Guangdong Army is stationed on the front lines in Guizhou, Guilin, and Guixian. Water and land transportation between Guangdong and Guangxi provinces has not yet been restored. Li, Bai, Zhang, and others are still in Guangxi, but their movements are uncertain."</p>
<p>Yunnan Army Withdraws. Huang Wen said, "Li Mingrui, Yu Zuoyu, Wei Baqun, and other units colluded with the communists and acted rampantly, repeatedly disturbing Longzhou and Baise. They have now fled to Jingzhou on the Hunan border and the Pingshi and Lanyang areas of Guangdong. The majority of the Yunnan Army has returned to Kunming, with only a small portion stationed on the Guangxi border."</p>
<p>Departure from Vietnam. "I left Liuzhou on November 24. Due to transportation difficulties, it took me about a month to reach Longzhou. I originally planned to pass through Vietnam to Hong Kong and then Shanghai, but at that time, the French authorities, citing the burning of the French Consulate in Longzhou by Li Mingrui's troops, prohibited Guangxi people from crossing the border, causing me to be stranded in Longzhou for a month. On the 13th of this month, I finally passed through Vietnam to Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, I met Mr. Ma Xiaojun and others, and we came to Shanghai together. Reports that I went to Guangzhou are incorrect. I now plan to rest in Shanghai for a few days before going to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<p>Ma Xiaojun's Remarks. Our reporter specifically interviewed Mr. Ma Xiaojun, the Chief Counselor of the General Headquarters, who accompanied Huang to Shanghai. Mr. Ma said, "I was ordered to go to Guangxi to engage in peace work. Fortunately, Li, Bai, Zhang, and others have realized the situation, stopped fighting, and are awaiting the Central Government to handle the aftermath. Regarding the follow-up issues in Guangxi, generally, Li and Bai will step down and go abroad, the army will be reorganized, the Central Government will send personnel to preside over Guangxi's administration, and the guest troops in Guangxi will be relocated to other defense areas by the Central Government. After Mr. Huang enters Beijing and meets with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, detailed measures will be determined. Zhang Fakui's troops now number only a few thousand, and their attitude is entirely based on the attitude of Li and Bai."</p>
<p>Chen Shi Goes to Beijing. Mr. Ma said, "Mr. Huang will be staying in Shanghai for several days. Counselor Chen Shi of the General Headquarters was recently ordered to go to Guangdong.

<h3 id="e153">Citywide Industry Associations Gather to Discuss Tax Issues <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of Tax Research Committee</p>
<p>The city's various industry associations held a general meeting of industry representatives yesterday afternoon at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce auditorium to discuss the issue of tax increases after the abolition of Likin, which is of great importance to industry and commerce. Over a hundred organizations, including the Money Trade Association, Tobacco Factory Association, Cotton Cloth Association, Silk Association, Medicine Association, New Medicine Association, Dried Goods Association, Wood Industry Association, Knitting Association, and others, sent over 160 representatives, including Luo Qinghua, Zheng Chengqing, Hu Xisheng, Jiang Zhigang, Shen Weiting, Chen Feiyuan, and Zhu Wenqi. Zheng Chengqing was elected chairman. After performing the ceremonial rituals, the chairman reported, "Distinguished representatives, today we have gathered representatives from various industries specifically to discuss the issue of tax increases after the abolition of Likin. We know that the quality of taxes is closely related to the prosperity and decline of industry and commerce. The Likin system of the past eighty years has directly bankrupted Chinese industry and commerce. This is the impact of poor tax policies. Now that the government is abolishing Likin, if the compensatory taxes are inappropriate, they will burden merchants and cripple industry. Moreover, the General Outline of Business Tax in various provinces stipulates that the members of the Business Tax Review Committee will be composed of tax officials, representatives of chambers of commerce, and designated accountants. We should not forget the position of commercial organizations and contribute as much as possible to the financial authorities for adoption. The Business Tax Collection Regulations promulgated by Zhejiang Province exceed the General Outline of Business Tax by a significant amount. Our city is adjacent to Zhejiang, with some companies having their headquarters in Shanghai and branches in Zhejiang, and others having their headquarters in Zhejiang and branches in Shanghai. The interests are closely intertwined. Furthermore, Zhejiang's promulgation of Business Tax Regulations is the first among the provinces, and in the future, other provinces will follow Zhejiang's lead. The impact will be significant. Do not disregard the matter simply because it pertains to Zhejiang. It should be known that Likin has caused harm for eighty years, spreading its poison throughout the country, starting with just the Xiannv Temple in Yangzhou. Therefore, at today's meeting, we should strive to address the excessive regulations on business tax in Zhejiang, and request that the Shanghai Municipal Government lightly tax industry and commerce, and ensure equal treatment for Chinese and foreign businesses in the Chinese and foreign concessions. It is hoped that the representatives present will express their opinions as much as possible, so that the most comprehensive solutions can be offered to the government authorities." After the chairman's report, discussions began, and the following results were achieved: (1) A telegram will be sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting a reduction in the business tax rate. (2) A petition will be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government requesting that Chinese and foreign businesses in the Chinese and foreign concessions receive equal treatment when drafting the General Outline of Business Tax, and that industry representatives be allowed to participate in discussions. (3) A Tax Research Committee consisting of industry associations will be established, and the following members will be appointed: Zheng Chengqing, Zhu Wenqi, Luo Qinghua, Zheng Meiluo, Ge Liangqing, Mao Chunpu, Shen Weiting, Sun Choucheng, Ye Chunqiao, Yu Baoxing, Wang Lianfang, Jiang Zhigang, Xie Zhongle, Lin Zhangrong, and Cheng Youfu, totaling fifteen people. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions.</p>
<h3 id="e154">British Economic Mission Hosts Reception for All Sectors Last Night <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Thomson's Farewell Speech</p>
<p>The British Far East Economic Mission is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 27th of this month for Guangdong, first to Hong Kong and then to Guangzhou, to inspect for one month, and then return to their country via Canada, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. As their departure is imminent, the Mission held a grand banquet at the Cathay Hotel last night to thank all sectors. Those present included Navy Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan, Jiangsu Higher Court Second Branch President Xu Weizhen, American Assessor Pandi, British Consul General Bai Linan, Industry Ministry's Shanghai Visiting Bureau Director Zhao Jinqing, Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Industry Ministry Secretary Xu Jianping, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce President Wang Xiaolai, Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Director Zou Bingwen, Zhejiang Industrial Bank President Xu Xinliu, Bank of China President Zhang Jia'ao, Zhejiang Industrial Bank President Li Ming, Central Mint Director Guo Biao, Foreign Affairs Office Shanghai Deputy Director Liu Yunfang, Fuxin Flour Mill General Manager Rong Zongjing, McLaren College President Xia Jinlin, Japanese Textile Industry Council Chairman Funatsu, British Chamber of Commerce President Marshall, Shen Bao's Gu Angruo, Xinwen Bao's Gu Zhizhong, North China Daily News's Semussen, Reuters's Gugges, and 200 others. The banquet was presided over by Sir Thomson, head of the British Economic Mission. The Cathay Hotel's music accompanied the dinner. After the banquet, Sir Thomson gave a speech thanking all sectors for their warm hospitality. Chen Shaokuan and Pandi also gave speeches on behalf of the guests. The gathering ended on a joyful note late into the night.</p>
<p>Thomson said in his speech, "British Consul General in Beijing, Sir Schneider, has received a special award from the national government, and we are delighted to have him here today. We have received warm hospitality in China, which has greatly comforted our mission. We would also like to thank all sectors for providing us with valuable assistance and helpful information. We have been in China for over four months, investigating and reporting on how to improve British trade. The decline of British-China commerce is well known. During our short time here, you expect me to tell you our impressions. However, this is difficult because there is so much we have seen and so much we have learned. We must sit down and organize it to obtain a true picture of all the issues surrounding trade between our countries. I think we have an understanding of what has happened in China, which has dramatically changed the situation. We must acknowledge these changes and prepare to move forward on a path of progress. People back home must work with the various industries here to meet the trends. Domestic exporters must have closer cooperation with importers here. If all parties approach it with determination and cooperation, everything can be hoped for. Our deepest impression is that China needs peace. We all agree that the establishment of lasting peace is sufficient to obtain stability and security, not only to make all industries flourish, but also to generally progress national social causes. China's foreign trade only reaches 12% of its population and only accounts for 2% of the world's total foreign trade, so there is room to increase its commercial position. This is not only our expectation but something that can be achieved. A peaceful China will greatly increase its trade capacity, import, and export business, and the UK hopes to occupy an important position in this. As for us, we will provide manufacturers and merchants at home with the facts and reports we have obtained to help them achieve this goal. The stability and security of China will attract financial assistance, which is essential during its construction period. Regarding this point, I firmly believe that the UK can participate. When the Blackburn Chamber of Commerce sent a mission in 1896, the price of silver in Shanghai was 2 shillings 11 pence per tael in November 1896, and it fell to 2 shillings 3.5 pence in September 1897, causing the entire business to plummet. When we arrived in Shanghai on October 25, the price of silver was 1 shilling 7 pence per tael, and today it has fallen to 1 shilling 3 pence. We are very concerned about the current price of silver and its impact on China's exchange rate. We cannot make any decisions for a while, but I feel that the world cannot allow it to hinder the restoration and prosperity of business. We deeply feel that there are many things China can do to adopt British engineering, such as electricity, sanitation, and running water, to improve the comfort of life and promote transportation to promote workers' abilities and improve the standard of living. We have also carefully and closely investigated important cotton and wool weaving industries. The results are difficult to say at the moment. However, we must let British manufacturers obtain the true situation of the Far East market. As for the cotton weaving industry, the UK will never fall behind.</p>
<p>Based on the results of our investigation in the East, we dare to say that the equipment of the Lancashire yarn factories is the best in the world, and their products are sufficient to meet the needs of the world market. Our mission is very optimistic, but to remedy the market and restore the original commerce, the public must have absolute self-confidence. Not only Shanghai is like this, but the whole world is like this. What has been lost in the past, we often lack self-confidence, and look forward without moving forward. From now on, if we can fight bravely and resolutely to overcome negative ideas, then the victory in the future will be assured. China's greatest need at the moment is peace and unity. It is hoped that the National Government's construction work will flourish. British merchants around the world will work together, and the UK's position in world commerce can be maintained. I raise this glass to wish the two countries of China and the UK boundless prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Public Concession Patrol's Plan for Preventing Kidnapping <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Board of Directors</p>
<p>To be Implemented Gradually Within Days</p>
<p>For the purpose of preventing kidnapping and protecting residents, the Public Concession Patrol has drafted a plan to increase police force and facilitate arrests. It has now been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department and will be implemented gradually within days. The content is roughly as follows: (1) Install roadside telephones; (2) Install wireless telephones in police stations and patrol cars so that communication can be maintained at all times; (3) Increase the number of patrol cars and motorcycles; (4) Organize special plainclothes teams; (5) Find suitable housing in the western district of the concession to set up a reserve patrol team. The total start-up cost for all items is approximately 118,000 taels, and the annual recurring cost will increase by approximately 56,000 taels. Regarding the installation of roadside telephones, the police station has been considering it for some time. Recently, the Shanghai Telephone Company's draft proposal has been adopted by the police department. Once an order is placed with the company, it can be installed in approximately nine months. After that, patrol officers and detectives can communicate with the police station at any time and place. In the event of an incident, patrol officers and detectives can immediately report to the police station, and the police station can also direct detectives at any time. Residents can also report to the police station immediately through patrol officers and detectives. In addition, it is planned to add wireless telephone sets to major police stations and install headphones in each patrol car to transmit orders. If there is a theft alarm in one place, nearby vehicles can be summoned to arrest the perpetrators. These patrol cars will usually patrol in sections to carry out search work, inspect passing vehicles, and supplement with motorcycles to patrol the alleys. In addition, automobile teams will be stationed at the main intersections in the western district, where serious kidnapping cases often occur, to conduct regular inspections. According to the minimum calculation, this patrol fleet requires approximately twelve cars and sixteen motorcycles to be dispatched. If suitable housing can be found in the western district, a reserve patrol team will be added to assist the inspection teams stationed at various main intersections. According to the police station's opinion, after this plan is fully implemented, it will be more effective in preventing kidnapping cases, so that Chinese residents can feel safer and trust the police station's capabilities more, and hope that they can support the police station more, cooperate with each other, eliminate violence, and ensure the safety of the community.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Higher Branch Court Handles Shanghai Political Prisoner Amnesty Case <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Totaling More Than Ten Political Prisoners</p>
<p>Transferred to the Jiangsu Higher Court for Review</p>
<p>Release Can Be Expected Next Week</p>
<p>The National Government's amnesty for political prisoners on New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic of China, after the decree was announced, and the procedures and methods for amnesty were stipulated, were handled by the Higher Courts of each province organizing review committees. Therefore, in the past ten days, the Higher Courts of each province have been actively handling this matter. In Shanghai, because there are more cases and the relationships are also more important, how the Shanghai Higher Branch Court is handling the situation has attracted much attention. A reporter from this newspaper made a special visit to the Higher Branch Court yesterday. According to the news from the procuratorate, the National Government's amnesty case was originally stipulated by the Ministry of Justice to be handled by the Higher Court, and the branch court could not handle it on its behalf. Later, the Hebei Higher Branch Court submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice for interpretation. The Ministry of Justice then reissued an order requiring the Higher Court to handle it. Although this branch court is directly under the Ministry of Justice, which is different from other branch courts, since the ministry's order has been stipulated, it still follows the ministry's order and does not organize a review committee. Only the political prisoners who have been judged by the former Provisional Court and this branch court (those who have served their terms have of course been released long ago, which is not a problem) who meet the amnesty regulations, totaling about a dozen people (the list must be approved before it can be published), are compiled and sent to the procuratorate of this branch court. This procuratorate will then forward it to the review committee of the Suzhou Higher Court. After the committee approves it, they can be released. This list has now been completed and is planned to be sent out today or tomorrow. It is expected to be replied to next week.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Phoenix Aircraft Departs Yesterday Morning <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Piloted by B.R. Phillipe to Little Luzon</p>
<p>Aircraft Carries One Package of Mail</p>
<p>The US Maclain Co.'s Phoenix aircraft departed from Hongqiao Airport at 8:10 yesterday morning, flying to Little Luzon. The pilot was Mr. B.R. Phillipe. It was expected to arrive in Guangzhou at 5:00 yesterday afternoon, but as of the time of this reporter's writing, there has been no confirmation. After arriving in Guangzhou, Mr. Phillipe will fly directly to Little Luzon without stopping along the way. This flight is the first of its kind and carries a package of mail. In addition, it is loaded with gasoline, about eighty-five gallons, enough to fly for ten hours in the air. Mr. Phillipe and his wife arrived at the airport at 7:15. His friends and staff of the US Maclain Co., among others, were at the airport to see him off. Mrs. Phillipe originally planned to fly with her husband, but because the cabin was loaded with gasoline, taking up a lot of space, it did not materialize. As soon as eight o'clock struck, the wings started up. B.R. Phillipe and his friends inspected the parts one by one and then began to circle the field. After proceeding for about 1,500 feet, the plane went straight into the clouds. The people seeing him off stood on tiptoe on the ground, craned their necks, waved their handkerchiefs, and waved their hands in the air to wish him a smooth journey. The speed of the plane is 105 miles per hour, so it can reach Guangzhou in nine hours at the latest.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Special Tax Issues on Silk and Cocoons <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Inquires with the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, it is reported that, according to a report on the 17th, the Special Tax Preparatory Office of the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the scope of collection of taxes on silkworms originally included the joint collection of cocoons, silk, and silk fabrics. The current tax rules</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The association believes that the joint collection of three items is similar to double taxation, and it has been decided to exempt silk and only collect taxes on cocoons and silk fabrics, etc. According to Article 4 of the Special Consumption Tax Regulations passed by the five-province tax reduction conference on December 5th of the 17th year of the Republic of China and promulgated by your ministry, it is stipulated that when the goods listed in this regulation are subject to heavy taxes, the original taxes shall be refunded separately according to the nature of the goods. The methods are as follows: (1) When collecting silkworm silk tax, refund the cocoon tax; (2) When collecting silk fabric tax, refund the silkworm silk tax, etc. The regulations are extremely detailed. With the tax refund system, there is no need to worry about the so-called heavy tax situation. If, as the original telegram says, instead of using tax refunds as a means to avoid heavy taxes, only collecting taxes on cocoons and silk fabrics is used as a way to avoid double taxation, then is it not a duplication to pay cocoon tax and then silk fabric tax? Moreover, in fact, only when cocoons and silk are woven into silk fabrics can they be consumed by people. Therefore, the consumption tax systems of various countries mostly tax finished products and not raw materials. We believe that the person who sent this telegram has not only not explored the tax rules, but also seems to be unaware of the consumption tax regulations promulgated by the ministry, which has led to this speculation. Our association has never dared to regard it as a precedent. However, the silk industry has been worried about this news, fearing that the principle of one item, one tax will be shaken by this. In order to comfort the merchants, we dare not be reckless and telegraph to your ministry, asking you to investigate the truth and reassure the public, which is convenient for everyone. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>
<h3 id="e161">Railway Bureau Expresses Sincere Intention to Implement the Resolutions of the Business Conference <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Decision to Implement in Order of Priority and Urgency Within a Time Limit</p>
<p>Substantial Organization to Prevent Theft</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited the Railway Bureau yesterday and met with Liu Chengchang and Zheng Baozhao, the director and deputy director of the Transportation Department. According to Mr. Zheng, the resolutions of the two-way business conference are now being sorted and classified, and a list of priorities and urgencies is being drawn up with time limits for implementation. A design committee will also be organized, divided into important, secondary, and ordinary groups, with time limits for implementation, so that the representatives' expectations at the conference can be fulfilled, with decisions made and implemented. Director Liu will come to Shanghai tomorrow (today), and this facility is planned to be signed by the staff and presented to Mr. Liu for organization and implementation. The special publication of the two-way business conference is also being handled by someone. A discussion meeting was convened the day before yesterday, and it was decided to include the photos of the responsible representatives from various places, the review committee members, other staff, the heads and deputy heads of each group, the correspondence, the detailed opinions of each person on each case, and various records in the special publication. As for the implementation of each resolved case, those related to mechanical and engineering affairs have been sent to the engineering department and mechanical department for review, budget preparation, and planning. The construction of double tracks on the Shanghai-Suzhou line must be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. To prevent cargo theft, a substantial organization will be properly handled. Yesterday, the Railway Bureau detained a thief in Rihui Port and sent him to court for severe punishment. In short, this business conference can provide great contributions to the Railway Bureau by remedying all the shortcomings of the two lines and soliciting business strategies. Both merchants and the Railway Bureau feel its benefits.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Request to Allow Unregistered Private School Students to Take Entrance Exams <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Various Universities Petition the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's crackdown on substandard private schools is very strict. Therefore, graduates and students of unregistered private schools cannot be treated the same as graduates or students of national or registered public and private schools, and are not allowed to transfer to national or registered schools to study. However, in order to help students from unregistered schools in this city with their studies, the universities in this port have repeatedly held meetings to discuss in detail that while substandard schools should be strictly cracked down on, the responsibility does not lie with the students, and that there are many outstanding people among the unregistered schools. If they are not helped, good and bad will be destroyed together, which is unfair and not the way for the country to cultivate talents. Therefore, they unanimously advocated jointly petitioning the Ministry of Education to change the method and allow national or registered schools to strictly examine and enroll students from unregistered private schools. It is reported that the documents were prepared the day before yesterday and submitted to the Ministry of Education for review. The original text of the submission to the ministry is as follows: "Respectfully submitted, recently read in the newspaper that your ministry is reviewing the qualifications of new students and transfer students reported by public and private universities this year, and all students from unregistered private schools have been ordered to withdraw from school. It shows your ministry's intention to strictly crack down on private schools. However, the schools, etc., believe that private schools that do not comply with the order to register and whose management does not meet the requirements can be ordered to close down to avoid misleading young people. As for the students who are studying and have graduated from schools such as Liao School, not all of them are stubborn and cannot be cultivated. If they are all given the punishment of withdrawing from school, there is a risk of destroying both good and bad. Moreover, before your ministry issued a clear order to crack down on private schools, these students did not know that they were making a mistake when they entered the school, and there are also many outstanding people among them. Now, if they are all prohibited from transferring or continuing their studies, then these students' years of time and money will be wasted, and the path to further education will be cut off from now on, which is a pity. Although your ministry had a screening test for students from private schools last summer, the time for the notice was short and it was only held in Shanghai. There may be places in remote areas of the interior that are not fully aware of it, or they may not have been able to take the exam as scheduled due to inconvenient transportation, so most students still feel regret and have no choice but to directly take the entrance exams of various schools. Although their level is comparable and they have been admitted, they are still subject to the punishment of withdrawal due to their qualifications. The spring enrollment period this year is approaching again, and most students from private schools are wandering on different paths, in a dilemma, which is pitiful. The schools, etc., have witnessed the situation and dare not remain silent. Therefore, they jointly petition your ministry to change the handling method. Before the deadline for private schools to register in the ministry's order this year, when students studying or graduating from unregistered private schools take the entrance exams of various schools, they will be allowed to take strict exams. If they pass, they will be treated the same as students from public or registered schools in order to help them. As for the strict examination method, your ministry can send personnel to supervise the examination, or your ministry can set another method. Is it appropriate? We hope that you will review and instruct us to comply, which is convenient for everyone. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Education, Jiang, the listed schools include Datong, Fudan, Hujiang, Guanghua, Daxia, Soochow, Political Science, Zhonggong, Law School, etc., a total of nine schools."</p>

<p>Fog Blocks Various Ships from Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai area was foggy the day before yesterday, and a total of more than twenty merchant ships from the Yangtze River and the sea were blocked outside Wusongkou. The fog had dissipated by yesterday morning and afternoon, and the ships were able to enter the port one after another. The river ships included Anji, Jiangxin, Jiangshan, Huangpu, Ruiyang, and the sea ships Sichuan, Zhi Shalak, and Xi Hou, all of which were delayed by one day. Yesterday, more than forty ships entered the Huangpu River in one day. The departure dates of the ships were also delayed by one day.</p>
<p>Discussing Escort Issues</p>
<p>The four companies operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route proposed to establish a security force to escort ships. The four-ship tea room has opposed this, and has submitted a memorandum to the companies, willing to have the crew兼任卫队. This matter concerns maritime safety, and the matter is inevitable. The Sanbei Company yesterday sent a letter to China Merchants Taikoo Ning Shao, inviting them to send representatives to the bureau today to discuss the issue of whether to establish a self-owned guard team or have the crew double as the guard team. The ship will arrive in Shanghai today. After the Xinming ship was stolen, the cargo inside the ship has been investigated by the surveyor Lloyd's. Yesterday, the ship telegraphed the Shanghai Bureau, saying that it has left Min and is heading to Shanghai. However, there are many fruits in Fuzhou that need to be loaded and transported urgently, and the passenger family still ordered the resumption of this route. The Fujian Provincial Garrison Headquarters has sent sixteen guards to the ship to serve as an escort team and protect the ship. The ship can arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>The Water Level of the Upper Yangtze River Declines Sharply</p>
<p>The water level of the Upper Yangtze River has declined sharply in recent days. Vessels of 500 tons cannot navigate between Hankou and Yichang, and the water level in Hunan is even lower. In recent days, a large number of cotton and food have been transported to Shanghai from Hunan. The ships cannot go to load. The six companies in this port have agreed to send barges to Hunan to be towed by small ships to Hankou, and then transfer to ships to go down the river.</p>
<p>Floating Bridge Prohibits Stacking Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Public Works Bureau yesterday sent a letter to the various shipping companies, saying, "Respectfully, it is found that stacking goods on the wharf floating bridge is extremely easy to cause danger and hinders traffic. It has long been in the category of being banned. At this time, when the revetment and floating bridge are waiting for repairs, stacking goods on the floating bridge should be strictly prohibited. According to the report of the wharf warehouse management office, recently, there have been occasional coolies stacking heavy goods on the floating bridge connecting the revetment, which is extremely dangerous and prohibits them from listening. If the floating bridge collapses, not only will the goods be damaged, but it will be difficult to avoid endangering lives. Please forward the letter to the various shipping companies to strictly prohibit this in order to maintain safety. In the event of damage, the coolies, etc., should be fully responsible."

<p>The Meeting Was Held at the Shanghai Quanzhe Guild Hall the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Ou Salt Public Office, which contracted for the tax sales of salt in Wenzhou and Chu Provinces of Zhejiang Province, convened a shareholders' meeting at the Quanzhe Guild Hall on Avenue Edward VII in this port on the 22nd of this month. The shares represented at the meeting reached four-fifths of the total share capital. The shareholders elected Chu Huiseng to preside over the report after the meeting began. First, it was decided that the contract period of the public office had expired, and the shareholders present today unanimously did not want to continue. Then, the methods for ending the meeting were discussed. It was decided to cancel the Board of Directors, and the shareholders elected representatives to preside over the handling separately. The shareholders elected Chu Huiseng and Chen Zaifeng as the plenipotentiary representatives to negotiate with the authorities, and the public office's official documents will be issued in the name of the representatives thereafter.

<h3 id="e167">Widespread Labor Strike at British American Tobacco's Tin Foil Factory in Pudong <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Factory Authorities Maintain a Firm Stance</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation Proves Ineffective</p>
<p>Yesterday, All 8,000 Workers Went on Strike</p>
<p>At the British American Tobacco factory in Pudong, last year at the end of the year, claiming slow business, suddenly dismissed 20 workers from the tin foil factory, causing a factory-wide slowdown. For two months, the dispute has not been resolved. The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau have convened labor and management several times for mediation, but the factory has been insincere in accepting, leading both sides to extremes. The night before last (22nd), the union convened an emergency representative meeting and decided to start a factory-wide slowdown for two hours on the morning of the 23rd. If the factory authorities do not wake up, they will continue the spirit of the 1926 general strike and prepare for a long-term struggle. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Donations for Relief: Since the tin foil factory labor strike occurred on November 14th of last year, the union, considering the approaching end of the year and the urgent need for relief for the workers, decided through a representative meeting to organize an economic preparatory committee to assist the dismissed workers of the tin foil factory, and submitted a request to the higher authorities for registration. Donations were solicited from all workers in the factory, with representatives contributing 40 cents of small silver per month, workers contributing 20 cents of small silver per month, and staff and supervisors making generous donations. The first donation totaled over 1,000 silver dollars, which were distributed to the workers to help them get through the New Year.</p>
<p>Bonus Issue: At the end of last year, the factory was supposed to issue year-end bonuses to the workers as usual, but the tin foil factory refused to issue them. The union sent representatives Geng Sheng, Chen Peide, Gu Ruofeng, and Xie Peiji to the factory on New Year's Eve to negotiate repeatedly. The factory authorities maintained a firm attitude. From 8 am to 10 pm, the representatives received nothing. Zhu Yuanhui, the captain of the Fourth Squad of the Police, mediated and the factory temporarily paid 500 yuan, distributing 5 yuan to each worker.</p>
<p>Final Mediation: The tin foil factory dispute has been repeatedly mediated by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau without a satisfactory resolution. On the 15th of this month, the union received a notice from the Social Affairs Bureau to convene labor and management to the bureau for mediation. The union sent Gu Ruofeng and Chen Peiji to comply. The factory was represented by Old Bubble, accompanied by translator Cao Yunxiang. As a result of the negotiations, the union representatives expressed concessions, but the factory representatives were insincere in accepting, resulting in no outcome and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Representative Meeting: Since the storm has been mediated several times by the party and government agencies, but the factory authorities have a firm attitude, and the two sides have gone to extremes, the union convened a temporary emergency representative meeting at 8 pm the day before yesterday. All representatives attended on time. Wu Jiaze, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, attended to provide guidance. Chen Peide was elected chairman, and Sun Xiaoshi was the recorder. Many important cases were resolved: (1) Starting at 7 am tomorrow (i.e., yesterday), all workers will slow down for two hours; (2) Issue a slowdown declaration; (3) Post slogans and publish in newspapers; (4) For workers doing early shifts in each department, the representatives of each department are responsible for notification; (5) If the slowdown tomorrow does not produce results, an emergency representative meeting will be convened that night. All the above cases were unanimously approved, and then the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wu Jiaze, gave guidance and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>Slowdown Declaration: Dear fellow workers, we 8,000 workers of the British American Tobacco factory are unfortunate to be born in a country with backward industries. Because of our need for survival, we have to submit to the iron hooves of imperialism, use our own blood and sweat to desperately produce for foreigners, and live like cattle and horses. We ask ourselves, we have not let the factory down in the slightest. However, the British imperialist capitalists, relying on the arrogance of their capital power, unreasonably oppress us, often causing disputes and making our lives unstable. Recently, the factory has been spreading rumors, saying that it will move the Pudong factory into the concession, or that it will reduce the scope of the Pudong factory and lay off a large number of people. We thought that this was just the factory's air pressure and would not become a reality. Unexpectedly, on November 14th of last year, the factory suddenly claimed that business was slow and suddenly announced the dismissal of 20 workers from the tin foil factory, giving each person only two weeks' severance pay. The workers were unwilling to accept the double savings and were forcibly driven out of the factory by the head of the department (Bubble), causing the entire department to be indignant and unanimously slowing down to provide assistance and put forward conditions: (1) All dismissed workers must be reinstated; (2) If they cannot be reinstated, each person will be given six months' severance pay in addition to savings; (3) In the future, when new workers are added to the tin foil factory, the dismissed workers must be given priority employment; (4) Replace the Westerner Bubble who beat the workers; (5) The wages during the slowdown period must be paid by the factory. The above conditions have been repeatedly negotiated by the union, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, at the factory without success. We know that the dismissal conditions put forward by the workers in that department are the minimum. If we cite the fact that the Pudong Nanyang factory stopped production in the past (one year and one month of dismissal pay, 5% double in addition to savings wages), we feel even more ashamed. Moreover, the factory's demand is greater than the supply, and it is not a slow business. Moving jobs is not comparable to stopping production. Why is it difficult to accept a small condition? The factory completely rejected the minimum demand. We are all cranial round toe square, how different is benevolence and unkindness? However, we have always taken care of the feelings of labor and management and avoided unexpected misfortunes. We have repeatedly tolerated all the more than one hundred workers in that department, and donated and rescued them from the whole. We originally hoped that the factory would finally wake up. Who would have thought that for two months, the party and government agencies would mediate again and again, and the factory's attitude was firm and insincere in accepting. Recently, they have intensified their efforts to renege on the workers' year-end bonuses, and even the lackey Cao Yunxiang has tried to sabotage them in many ways. The workers in that department are already unbearable under this double pressure. All the workers are interdependent and it is even more difficult to sit idly by. Now the representative meeting has decided to slow down for two hours. If the factory does not wake up again, it will continue the spirit of the 1926 general strike and fight to the death with the British imperialist capitalists. Dear compatriots, our hot blood is boiling, our grief is tense. We will prepare 8,000 groups of armed forces and start fighting for our lives. Now we will inform all sectors of the facts of the past and seek public judgment. Especially the revolutionary workers in the tobacco industry, the workers of the British American Tobacco factory under the same oppressed class, hope to give us sympathetic assistance so that we can achieve the final victory in the strict barriers of imperialism and capitalism. (The following is omitted)</p>
<p>Warning to Cao Yunxiang: This association's 8,000 workers are forced under the factory's iron hooves, weeping and groaning, and one word is enough. This time, the factory dismissed 20 workers from the tin foil factory for no reason, causing a factory-wide slowdown. The party and government agencies repeatedly mediated, but the factory was insincere in accepting. So far, the dispute has been prolonged for more than two months, and more than one hundred workers are in extreme pain. All those with blood and energy are filled with resentment. But Mr. does not only not pity and mourn, but also sabotages it in many ways. Although Bubble has little heart, does Mr. not have parents? Moreover, Mr.'s past behavior and facts are on record, and this association has warned him on file. But he is willing to flatter foreigners, cling to evil and not repent, suck blood and abandon his teeth, and mutilate the same kind. This association finds it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we give a serious warning again (the following is omitted).</p>

<p>Petitioning the Local Court for Compulsory Enforcement</p>
<p>According to Hua Dong News Agency, the workers of the Chunhua Rubber Factory requested to return to work, but were rejected by the management. They petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. At that time, labor and management signed an agreement, which stipulated that they would return to work yesterday.

Yesterday, the workers submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau asking for relief, and the worker representatives Li Yongquan and Yang Xifan submitted a document to the local court asking for compulsory enforcement.</p>

<p>Implemented from February</p>
<p>In order to seek security for the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, the two railway bureaus specially initiated the organization of the Two Railway Employee Life Insurance Association. The intention is that all employees of the railway who die of illness or accidental injury during their service will receive a one-time funeral expense of 300 yuan from the association. However, when serving on the railway, each person must pay an insurance premium of 1 yuan per year, paid in four installments. If employees have urgent needs, they can also apply to the association for a loan with a guarantee, deducted from their salary in installments, but not exceeding twice the monthly salary and half of the existing alimony. All regulations have been formulated and distributed to all stations, and all preparations have been made. It will be officially implemented from February. This move is a blessing for the employees of the railway.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Xue Bao’s Property Division Case Petitioned for Early Trial <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Request for Preliminary Injunction of the Villa on Avenue Joffre First</p>
<p>The Remaining Assets will be Requested for Relief After Investigation</p>
<p>In the case of Xue Baorun's estate, his daughter Xue Baobao submitted another petition to the French Concession Court yesterday, requesting an immediate trial. The petition stated: "The plaintiff Xue Baobao, by her legal guardian Xue Wang Amei, and her litigation agents Wu Jingxiong Lawyer, Dong Kang Lawyer, and Pan Chenge Lawyer, are suing the defendants Xue Gu Qiaolin, Xue Jiasheng, Xue Gansheng, Xue Sunshi, Xue Yansheng, and Xue Gensheng for a division of inheritance. Before the court, the defendants fraudulently reconciled and requested a preliminary injunction and a speedy judgment. In this case, Gu Qiaolin and Xue Sunshi, etc., are suspected of impersonation and collusion, so before the continued hearing of the case of Qiaolin, etc., on January 14, the plaintiff filed this lawsuit on the 13th and published it in the newspaper at the same time, revealing the fraudulent reconciliation of Qiaolin and Xue Sunshi. On the 14th, after checking the previous court summonses of the lawyer Yuan Xilian, etc., commissioned by Qiaolin, the plaintiff submitted a request for postponement. Since the 14th, Qiaolin and Xue Sunshi, etc., have had no words to defend against the plaintiff's daily announcements in the newspaper. As late as the 20th, Lawyer Lin Yingqing published a statement in the newspaper claiming reconciliation and dismissal of the case, suddenly changing the plaintiff's surname to Gu, which was in extreme conflict with the report published by Lawyer Zheng in the name of Xue Baobao. Lawyer Lin claimed to be the lawyer for Sunshi and Jiasheng, etc., and Gu Qiaolin asked him to prove that the plaintiff's claims were false, etc. If you think about it, why would falsehood need a lawyer to use the procedure of proof? There is no reason for the plaintiff to ask the defendant's lawyer to prove that he is false. Moreover, Yuan Xilian Lawyer, who was commissioned by Qiaolin to appear in court, and Lin Yingqing Lawyer were opponents, why didn't they mention a word that they had requested a postponement on the 14th? It is obvious that the original defendant in that case was fraudulently reconciled. Fearing that they would conceal or sell the inheritance and endanger future execution, the plaintiff, in accordance with Article 627 of the Civil Procedure Law, urgently requested the court to grant a preliminary injunction for the villa at No. 832 Avenue Joffre, which was left by the plaintiff's father, Li Quan Gong. The rest is still under investigation, and the real estate and cash that are not in the French Concession will be requested for relief. The plaintiff in the defendant's case also clearly has the surname Xue and is the biological daughter of Li Quan Gong. During breastfeeding, there was a conflict of interest with the stepmother and jealousy from the brothers. The plaintiff should spend time with the biological mother. In addition to the four brothers, there is also a sister named Xiangbao. According to the law, the plaintiff should get one-sixth of the estate. The villa in Li Quan, which is requested for a preliminary injunction this time, is already worth more than 300,000 taels of silver. The total amount of the entire inheritance is one thousand several hundred million. When the lawsuit was filed on the 13th of this month, because the detailed number of assets was not listed, only 30 yuan of court fees were paid. Now, an additional 170 yuan is submitted with the petition, and a combined statement is made. Because the defendant fraudulently reconciled, the plaintiff urgently requests an investigation and a continued early trial. The previous petition requested the court to summon the defendant for a hearing immediately and grant a speedy judgment.</p>

<p>Not only Robbing Clothes and Belongings</p>
<p>But also Killing the Victims</p>
<p>Zhu Huanzhang, a bill collector from the Dongcheng Automobile Company on Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, Suzhou, was robbed and killed. On the night of the 19th, Zhu Huanzhang, a native of Suzhou, a bill collector from the Dongcheng Automobile Company on Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, went out after bathing in the Longquan Bathhouse on Zhejiang Road. When he passed the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Shilu Road, he was surrounded and searched by several short-clothed robbers. More than 100 yuan in cash was taken away. Not content with this, they wanted to strip off his clothes. When Zhu shouted, they shot him with a pistol after robbing his clothes. With a loud bang, Zhu fell to the ground in response. When the robbers ran away, he endured the pain and reported to the nearby police. He was hired to be taken to Renji Hospital. The doctor confirmed that the injury was critical. Although the bullet was removed by surgery, it was difficult to take effect. He died in the hospital the afternoon before yesterday. The police station in charge reported that they had sent police to carry the body to the mortuary on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo, a prosecutor from the Special District Local Court, arrived at the mortuary to investigate. The father of the deceased, Zhu Peiqing, requested to claim the body for coffin burial, and asked to quickly arrest the murderer and punish them. Prosecutor Guo approved his request and ordered Zhu Peiqing to make a guarantee, claim the body for coffin burial, and ordered the police to strictly arrest the murderer and bring them to justice for interrogation.</p>

<p>Both Men and Women were Convicted Yesterday</p>
<p>Among the kidnappers caught in the Lu Shaotang kidnapping case was Feng Muqing, who was fond of prostitution. He often visited the Pipa Gate Alley. He had made a bite-arm alliance with a prostitute named Wang in Fuxiang Lane. The prostitute was 22 years old. Later, she was taken away by Jin Dekang. However, she still did not forget the old love. She often went to the hotel alone with Feng Muqing behind Jin's back to continue enjoying each other. On the day Feng was arrested, he was walking with her, so he was also arrested. At this time, Jin Dekang only found out the inside story, so he filed a lawsuit against Wang and Feng for adultery. Feng Shide, the judge of the Special District Local Court in charge of the Lu case, first concluded the trial of this case. The verdict was announced yesterday morning, and the main text said that Wang Fengshi, i.e., Jin Wangshi, committed adultery with Feng Muqing and was sentenced to ten months of imprisonment. Feng Muqing committed adultery with Jin Wangshi and was sentenced to nine months of imprisonment for deterrence. After the sentencing, they were still taken away by the police for custody and waited for the verdict of the kidnapping case before being sent to prison for execution.</p>

<p>Bandits Concoct a Scheme to Deceive 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Repeated Contacts with No Trace</p>
<p>Family Members Have Already Completed Funeral Rites</p>
<p>Tang Shaoru, an old man from Zhangyan, Jinshan County, who was 77 years old, left the hospital in Shanghai at 7:45 pm on September 16th of last year and suddenly disappeared on the way. His family members offered a reward to find him, but were cheated by bandits who sent letters and lost 200 yuan, etc., which has been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the old man has been missing for more than four months since he disappeared. It is now heard that his family members have completed funeral rites because there is still no trace. However, the process is quite tortuous and interesting. A total of eight letters of extortion were received from the bandits. The details are recorded as follows: Tang Lao lives in Zhangyan North Street and runs a Tangtai Ji preserved meat shop. He has a wife and a son. His wife is 50 years old and his son is only 14 years old. Tang is very healthy. In August of last year, he came to Shanghai to discuss business. Unexpectedly, he contracted syphilis and was introduced by a friend to a hospital for treatment. As a result, he was overly depressed and his nerves were confused. On September 16th, when his illness recovered slightly, he left the hospital and suddenly disappeared. His family members searched everywhere and posted rewards in the newspaper, but there was no trace. At the end of September, his family suddenly received a letter stating that Tang Lao was unharmed in Shanghai. It was only necessary to prepare 1,500 silver dollars and place the money in the grass shoes left on the grassland east of Xujiahui Railway Station in West Shanghai. After receiving the money, they would send the person back the next day, etc. His family members knew that he had been kidnapped, so they immediately replied to the letter in the grass shoes, asking to reduce the amount of money and to show evidence first. At the beginning of October, they received another letter from the bandits, stating that they would prepare 400 yuan, pay 200 yuan first, and the remaining 200 yuan would be allowed to be delivered the next day. His family members were eager to return home because they thought that Tang was old, so they immediately prepared 200 yuan and sent someone to place it in the broken shoes next to the coffin in the Beicao Pavilion in Xujiahui. The next day, his family members waited anxiously, but unexpectedly there was no news. They realized that they had been defrauded by the bandits. Later, at the beginning of November, his family members were anxious because he had been missing for two months and his whereabouts were still unknown. Unexpectedly, they suddenly received another letter from the bandits, claiming that the money had been received as scheduled, but because the amount was too small, it was not enough to distribute, so they did not send the person. They asked for 1,000 yuan, etc. His family members suspected that it was a trick and ignored it. Unexpectedly, the bandits still sent a letter every five days and a letter every ten days until the end of December, a total of eight letters. What was said in the letter seemed to be Tang Lao's tone, and he described his history from childhood to adulthood in detail without any deviation. He also wrote down the three characters of his unknown nickname "Tang Bench" and asked friends to help find a way to pity his old age. In the eighth letter, he still only needed 200 yuan to be placed in the original place. Upon receipt, he would immediately send the person back. This small amount was only used to pay for food expenses, etc., because Tang was ill, so as not to end his life, etc. So his family members saw the history he described and suddenly believed that he had been kidnapped. However, having been deceived before, they decided not to make the same mistake again, so they immediately replied and agreed to send the money on which day. At the same time, they reported to the Caojiadu Sixth District Police Station. Under the leadership of Chief District Inspector Xu, the detective team leader Liu Shaoqing, detectives Gan Youxin, Tang Bingxiang, Wu Rui, etc., and his family members all disguised themselves and went to Xujiahui according to the address. They wrapped the newspaper into 200 yuan of banknotes and placed it in the broken shoes. All the detectives were waiting nearby, ambushing for inspection. They waited for half a day and a night, but no one came to pick it up. There was no trace. Two days later, they went to see it, and the package was still in the shoes. Although his family members sighed in horror, they were still looking forward to it in Shanghai. The mystery in this is a hundred-fold and cannot be solved. Another month has passed, and there is still no news. It is expected that there is no hope of returning alive, so they returned to their hometown the day before yesterday and carried out the funeral rites.</p>

<p>A Dilemma Causes Erratic Driving</p>
<p>Hitting a Tree Causes It to Fall and Break the Water Tank</p>
<p>Backing Up the Car Runs Over a Police Officer</p>
<p>At 9:55 yesterday morning, at the intersection of Sanyi Lane, east of Yangshupu Bridge, a Route 9 public bus, registered as 11508, driven by driver Xu A'er, was traveling from west to east. A streetcar in front of it was stopped at the station, preventing the public bus from moving forward. There was also a car following behind. Driver Xu A'er, seeing this situation, was in a dilemma. Wanting to avoid the car behind him, he quickly turned the steering wheel and drove to the side. However, he was flustered and driving erratically, causing the front of the car to hit the tree trunk on the side of the road. The tree fell down and broke a water tank. Xu then backed up the car. A police officer named Jin Dexin, number 3069, was coming on a bicycle and was unable to stop in time. He was run over by the public bus. The wheel rolled over Jin's face, and the blood and flesh were blurred, which was unbearable to watch. Even the bicycle became tile-like. A police officer number 179 arrived and copied the driver's number. The injured police officer was sent to the hospital for treatment by a fire truck. After arriving at the hospital, Jin was unconscious and feared for his life.</p>

<p>Because of the Thick Clothes, It Was Not Easy to Sink</p>
<p>The Police Rescued Him and He Was Not Dead</p>
<p>At 0:40 yesterday morning, a middle-aged man threw himself into the Huangpu River in the dark of night at the Swire Wharf in the French Concession. Because of the thick clothes, he did not sink for a while. The police officers numbers 12 and 28 of the Water Police Station were patrolling on the bank of the Huangpu River. Hearing a sound in the Huangpu River, they immediately turned on the electric torch and saw the situation. They immediately rushed forward and rescued him from the water, celebrating his rebirth. The Huangpu wind blew and his face was pale. He was taken to the police station and given dry clothes to change into. After questioning, he said that his name was Wu Wenbing, 27 years old, from Shaoxing. He is now working in the Qingchun Socks Factory in Changan Lane, Wusong Road. Because he has heavy debts, amounting to more than 300 yuan, and cannot repay them, and the debt period is approaching and difficult to cope with, he threw himself into the Huangpu River to die. Shen Kuishan, who works in the same factory, is my best friend. After verifying the confession, the head of the police ordered Detective Wu Rongsheng to send him to his friend's place to find a way to provide relief after dawn.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Robbery at a Silk Weaving Factory – Detectives Capture Two Thieves <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Neighbors Assist in Reporting to the Police</p>
<p>Detectives Rush to Encircle and Capture</p>
<p>Thieves Confess to Holding a Meeting</p>
<p>Stolen Foreign Currency Recovered</p>
<p>Hu Junzhi established a silk weaving factory at No. 75 Mingyuan Lane, Huade Road. At precisely 12:00 AM the previous evening, while distributing monthly salaries to the workers, four thieves suddenly broke into the factory through the back door. Each wielding a pistol, they first drove seven or eight workers downstairs into a room and locked them up. Then, two thieves specifically went upstairs and confined Hu in a pavilion room, before starting to rob. They stole a total of 350 yuan in banknotes, foreign currency, and small silver coins, along with three gold rings. Hu, noticing a window in the pavilion room, opened it and informed the neighbor, Lu Yinchao. Lu immediately telephoned the Yangshupu Police Station to report the incident. Detectives Zhang Degong and other Western detectives were dispatched to encircle and capture the thieves. By then, the thieves had already finished robbing and, having abandoned two pistols—one in a water basin and the other in a bamboo basket covered with cloth—they fled out through the back door. They happened to encounter the detectives. The two thieves in front managed to escape, but the two behind were captured. One was Shi Hongquan from Zhenjiang, and the other was Ding Yongqing from Jiangbei. Shi had 110 yuan of the stolen foreign currency hidden on his person, which was also completely recovered. They were taken back to the police station, and further inquiries were made at the silk weaving factory about the robbery. The two pistols left behind by the thieves were collected by the factory staff and handed over to the detectives, with twelve live bullets still in them. Later, according to the thieves' confession, their accomplices had fled to a certain location at the South Railway Station, but a search there yielded nothing. Yesterday morning, the police summoned the factory owner Hu Junzhi and the mechanic Chen Jiangang to escort Shi and Ding to the Special District Local Court. Judge Feng conducted the preliminary hearing, and the police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case, requesting a postponement for further investigation of another case. Subsequently, Hu, Chen, and others described in detail the robbery and identified the captured men as those who had carried out the armed robbery at the scene. Under questioning, Shi and Ding claimed that the whole thing was initiated by a Liu surnamed individual who was still at large, and that a meeting had been held in front of the Great World entertainment center beforehand. They stated that besides what was found during the search, the rest of the stolen goods were taken away by Liu and a certain Yang.

<h3 id="e180">Murderer Wu AYu Sentenced to Hanging <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Wu AYu, a native of Pudong, was only twenty-four years old and worked as a carpenter. He had a dispute with Ji Ruiqing. On the evening of January 7th of the eighteenth year of the Republic, at 7:30 PM, he shot and killed Ji on Menala Road. The Huishi Police Station apprehended him and handed him over to the former Provisional Court, which sentenced him to life imprisonment. The case was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which sent it back for retrial. The retrial resulted in a death sentence. Wu appealed, but his appeal was rejected. Now, upon receiving instructions from above to carry out the execution according to law, Judge Ge of the Special District Local Court ordered Wu to be brought to court yesterday afternoon. He asked Wu if he had any last words. Wu said that he had no face to see his family again and had no last words, but he requested some wine and food. Judge Ge ordered wine and food to be prepared. After he had finished drinking, the escorts were ordered to put him on a prison vehicle and take him directly to the execution ground at the Jiangsu Prison in Caohejing. Prosecutor Wu Shixin was appointed by the Procuratorate of the Local Court as the supervising officer of the execution. He ordered Police Chief Yang Deshan and Police Officer Chen Xihui to lead six executioners, Gu Hanqing, Xue Bingzhang, Zhu Wanyuan, Yin Daoxu, Zhang Chunshen, and Wu Xisheng, along with the necessary equipment, to travel to the prison in separate cars. Prosecutor Wu, along with Warden Huang Changmin and Clerk Qian Yinpei, took their positions on the official platform. Wu AYu was brought forward for questioning: (Question) Age 24, from Shanghai, residing in Qichang Inn, Pudong. (Question) Do you have anything to say? (Answer) Just execute me. (Question) Who is in your family so they can collect your body in the future? (Answer) Since I am already dead, whether they collect the body or not is not a problem, there's no need to ask. His attitude was so strong, he truly had no fear of the law. The order was given to execute. Under the command of Police Chief Yang, the executioners bound the prisoner to a wooden stake and slowly hanged him according to law. He died soon after. The examiner Xuan Zhiming certified his death, and the clerk supervised the sealing of the execution rope. The body was left exposed overnight, awaiting another examination the next day (today) before being collected.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Daily and Night Bank Liquidation – Depositors Registering Even More Crowded – Yesterday's Report <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day after the announcement of the liquidation of the Daily and Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Park Savings Department. The number of depositors going to the liquidation office to register was even more crowded. The following is a summary of what was heard yesterday.</p>
<p>Guarding of the Huang Residence: Yesterday morning, a small group of labor and women depositors gathered again in front of Huang Chujiu's private residence on Avenue Edward VII. After receiving the report, the police immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to protect the Huang residence. Yesterday afternoon, the double doors of the Huang residence were tightly closed and guarded by Chinese police officers. Fortunately, no incidents occurred. At the same time, the main entrance of the Great World and the main branch of the Daily and Night Bank were also guarded by armed police officers from the French Concession Police Station.</p>
<p>Coffin Value: According to a letter from Dr. Zang Payong, Huang Chujiu's son-in-law, "Regarding the reports that my late father-in-law Huang Chujiu's coffin was worth 7,000 yuan, this is far from the truth. Three years ago, my late father-in-law suffered from severe lung disease. At that time, a friend from Sichuan transported several coffins from Sichuan. They were of good quality and inexpensive. I persuaded him to purchase one. The value at that time was only over 1,000 yuan. The 7,000 yuan figure is a misrepresentation."</p>
<p>Creditors' Meeting: The executive committee of the Shanghai Daily and Night Bank Great World Savings Department creditors' group held its second meeting yesterday (the 23rd). The attendees included Tu Yunchao, Wu Ruzhen, Ying Kewen, Wang Wentong, Yuan Youlan, Ji Hanzhang, Wu Tingying, Lu Bingyan, Yang Dihua, Liu Qiyun, Shao Shuwei, Chen Huiqun, Pan Binzhang, Liu Hesheng, Zuo Zhengping, Lu Chengzhu, Zhu Hailan, and others, a total of 21 people. The meeting started at 5:00 PM. After the formalities, Ying Kewen was elected as the chairman, and Tu Yunchao served as the recorder. The discussion lasted for four hours, and the following important matters were resolved: (1) It was decided to expedite the execution of the committee's affairs and the resolutions of yesterday's first committee meeting. Zhu Huan, a lawyer, was also hired as the honorary legal advisor to the committee on a temporary basis. (2) To facilitate the registration of creditors, in addition to entrusting lawyer He Shimai (No. 25 Renji Road) as per the first resolution, the committee also decided to hold registration at the Jixi Fellow Villagers Association office at No. 231 Lloyd Road. (3) It was decided that the accounting director must have adequate security to ensure public confidence. (4) It was decided to appoint Mr. Pan Binzhang as the accounting director. (5) It was decided on the format of the registration form. (6) The committee should add representatives to draft an official letter to the Huang family's post-mortem committee to formally contact them, requesting a concrete response, expressing their attitude, and outlining the method of handling the situation. It was decided to send Tu Yunchao, Wang Zhongfa, Zhang Dengmin, Lu Bingyan, Chen Dongqun, and Wu Tingying to contact the committee. (7) It was retroactively approved that Wu Tingying and Zhu Hailan were appointed as standing committee members. The resolutions were passed.</p>
<p>Warning to the Corporation: The Shanghai Great World Savings Department Daily and Night Bank Creditors' Committee issued a letter warning the board of directors of the Gongfa Corporation, stating, "The Great World Amusement Park Savings Department and the Shanghai Daily and Night Bank, which belong to your corporation, suddenly announced the suspension of deposit payments on the 20th of this month and appointed personnel for liquidation, causing countless creditors to feel shaken. According to the resolution of this creditors' committee, we urge your corporation to pay off the principal and interest of all depositors of the two departments by February 7th of this year to demonstrate credibility and safeguard the creditors' rights. We hereby notify you. This is addressed to the board of directors of the Shanghai Gongfa Corporation."</p>
<p>Declaration Published: Following the death of Mr. Huang Chujiu, his relatives and friends organized a post-mortem committee. The committee decided to maintain the normal operation of Huang's businesses, such as the Jiufu, Fuchang, Zhongxi, and Zhongfa companies. However, the Great World Savings Department and the Daily and Night Bank suspended deposit payments and announced liquidation, causing the rights of the creditors of these two departments to be shaken. During Mr. Huang's lifetime, he relied on these two institutions to absorb the hard-earned money of countless ordinary people, using it as a foundation for developing other businesses. Therefore, the depositors of these two departments contributed greatly to Mr. Huang's various enterprises. In terms of both reason and morality, the creditors of these two departments should enjoy priority and special protection without any doubt. Now, the opposite is happening, which is unreasonable and unfair. Furthermore, according to the principles of bankruptcy law in various countries, creditors of savings departments must be repaid first, which is a worldwide practice. This is done to protect the interests of poor depositors and to consolidate the credibility of the savings industry. Moreover, the creditors of these two departments are mostly poor households, with deposits ranging from thousands or hundreds to tens or even a few yuan. This is their hard-earned money accumulated through daily labor and frugality. Once it is shaken, there is a risk to their lives and property. Just look at the weeping elderly women and men in front of the two institutions every day, the shop assistants and laborers beating their chests and stamping their feet on the road. The situation is unspeakably tragic. If the principal and interest are not maintained and repaid first, there will inevitably be life-threatening actions during this cold winter season, or even desperation, leading to major incidents, which would not be fortunate for either side. We earnestly hope that all sectors will uphold justice and provide assistance so that the hard-earned money of thousands</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>of households can be preserved. This is of great importance and extremely urgent.</p>
<p>Further News: The creditors of the Shanghai Daily and Night Bank Great World Deposit and Amusement Department held a creditors' meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday (January 23rd) at the law office of Yan Luqing at No. 9 Avenue Edward VII. Attorney Yan was elected as chairman, and Mr. Zhao Yangsheng served as the recorder. The meeting was held as scheduled, and various important matters were discussed for a long time until the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. The resolutions are recorded below: (1) The name of the association is the Daily and Night Bank Great World Deposit and Amusement Department Creditors' Association. (2) The association will temporarily use the law office of Yan Luqing at No. 9 Avenue Edward VII as its office. (3) The association should immediately issue a declaration. (4) Creditors who have not yet joined the association should be allowed to continue to register. (5) Attorney Yan is requested to provide guidance and assistance in the association's affairs. (6) It was found that the creditors' deposits were mostly small amounts of hard-earned money accumulated over time, with the majority being women and laborers, mostly ranging from one yuan to tens or hundreds of yuan, which greatly affected the livelihood of ordinary people. As Attorney Yan is known for his sense of justice and willingness to help, he was specially requested to serve as the honorary attorney for the association, which he graciously accepted. (7) Letters were sent to the Huang Chujiu post-mortem committee, requesting Mr. Yu, Mr. Wang, Mr. Yuan, and others to assist in handling the matter. (8) The liquidator was requested to provide the balance sheets of the Daily and Night Bank Great World Deposit and Amusement Department as of the date of the shutdown. (9) An investigation was conducted into all of Huang Chujiu's estate. (10) It was resolved to work hard to achieve the goal of fully recovering the deposits.</p>
<p>Committee Meeting: Yesterday afternoon, the post-mortem handling committee, led by Yu Qiaqing and others, convened a meeting to investigate the assets and liabilities of the Fuchang Tobacco Company and decided to start investigating the accounts of the Zhongxi Pharmacy today, with the aim of determining a method within a short period to protect the interests of the creditors.</p>

<p>Public Security Bureau of Shanghai, Announcement Zheng Zi No. 1: For the matter of announcement, it is found that at various ship docks, there are often thugs harassing passengers. This matter is done by unemployed vagrants. The Bureau believes that they are very ignorant and pitiful, so it first used written announcements to persuade them. However, they did not listen to the persuasion and abandoned themselves. Furthermore, cases of impersonating rickshaw pullers, porters, and hotel receptionists to deceive passengers are often discovered. Such a situation not only makes it difficult for the authorities to investigate and apprehend them but also hinders your business and reputation. For the purpose of protecting passengers, we cannot allow these</p>

<p>Shanghai thugs to act arbitrarily. Therefore, on the one hand, we are increasing the number of uniformed police officers and detectives to arrest them. On the other hand, we are thinking of a method for you to distinguish between good and bad so that you will not be wronged. All the measures are written in detail below and will be implemented by February 1st, the 20th year of the Republic. We hope that everyone will abide by them. If you fail to comply, you will be punished according to law. This is the announcement. The details are as follows: 1. Rickshaws should be parked in designated parking areas near each dock. The rickshaw pullers should sit in their rickshaws in order and allow passengers to choose them. They must not go beyond the parking area or rush out to抢生意. 2. Automobiles and carriages, except those for private use, are not allowed to park at the docks. 3. The porters used by each dock company should be provided with a blue vest by the company, with the number of the porter written in red lettering on the front and back. 4. Hotel receptionists who go to the docks to pick up guests should be provided with a set of black uniforms and caps by the hotel. If they wear a long coat, they should wear a black vest over it, with the hotel name and receptionist number written in red lettering on the front and back. This number should be the same as the receptionist's identification badge number. They should also carry their license and certificate with them at all times for inspection to prevent impersonation. 5.

<h3 id="e184">Dong Jiangshi Urges Trial for Divorce Case <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Submits Document to the French Concession Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Xinsheng Society: The case of lawyer Dong Yu suing his wife Jiang Youzhi for suffering from lung disease and requesting a divorce has been reported in detail in this newspaper. After the French Concession Court heard the case, it ordered a trial reconciliation. However, due to the complexity of the matter, it ultimately failed. Now, his wife, Jiang, believes that the case has been pending for too long and that complications have arisen. She has now hired two lawyers, Sheng Shenghiu and Wang Kanghou, to file a petition with the French Concession Court, requesting a trial. The original petition is as follows: "For the matter of falsely accusing lung disease and filing for divorce, the case has been pending for too long, and we have repeatedly requested a trial. The defendant, Jiang, was sued for divorce by the plaintiff, Dong Yu, also known as Dong Jingxi, in November of last year, who claimed that she had long suffered from lung disease. The judge ordered reconciliation twice. However, the plaintiff had no intention of reconciliation. The defendant submitted a petition and the Women's Association also sent letters requesting a trial. Since the beginning of the year, almost a month has passed. However, the plaintiff has come up with strange ideas, hiring two female teachers in the name of teaching his six-year-old son. One of them is lodging in the pavilion room where the defendant lives, and the other, dressed extravagantly like a noble lady, comes to the house in the evening and leaves late at night. The plaintiff has contracted the disease as a result of this and has also hired a couple who were previously unacquainted to take care of him on his sickbed. All of these situations have been witnessed by servants. How can there be any family order left? It is thought that if this case is suspended for a long time, not only will the defendant's status never be clarified, but living with relatives is also not a long-term solution, and it is even more difficult to prevent other changes from occurring, leading to abuse in her remaining life. The only hope is to rely on the sanctity of the law for protection. Therefore, we humbly request the judge to set a date to summon both parties for trial and make a judgment in accordance with the law. This would be a great kindness."</p>
<h3 id="e185">Report on Water Meter Damage Due to Freezing – Water Company Repairs Without Charge <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Due to the severe cold weather in recent days, water meters in many households in the city have been damaged due to freezing. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has heard that users are complaining because they believe that water meter freezing is a matter of weather, but the water company will still demand compensation according to regulations; otherwise, they will not repair it or will even stop supplying water, hindering the economic life of the public. Therefore, on the 20th of this month, the bureau separately convened the business directors of the inland and Zhabei water companies to the bureau for discussion. Although the regulations of the companies stipulate that the user is responsible for any damage to the water pipes and all accessories within the water meter, there are no clear regulations on who is responsible for the damage caused by water meter freezing. It was agreed that when users discover a water source interruption or water meter freezing, they should immediately report it to the company. The company will send workers to repair or replace it and restore the water supply immediately without charging any fees. If the user does not report to the company at the time and repairs it without authorization, resulting in damage to the water meter, and then reports to the company for repair, the company may repair it first and restore the water supply, but all damage and repair costs should be compensated by the user. This method is fair to both users and the company. It is heard that the bureau has ordered the two companies to comply and notify all users to follow the regulations.</p>

<p>Question of Whether Nie Dianbang Was the Mastermind</p>
<p>Trial Can Only Begin After Evidence Is Complete</p>
<p>Nie Dianbang, the murderer who assassinated the revolutionary martyr Chen Yingshi, was arrested in Shanghai at the beginning of the month and detained by the Public Security Bureau. Later, following an order from President Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government, the suspect was transferred to Nanjing for trial. It was done on the 13th of the month. Now it is learned that President Chiang believes that the case is of great importance and cannot be handled hastily. Guilt cannot be determined without a detailed investigation, so he has sent personnel to Shanghai to conduct an investigation. The personnel came to Shanghai yesterday to conduct the investigation, and everything is being kept secret for the time being. However, according to the personnel, the assassination of Chen Yingshi was far back in the fifth year of the Republic, fifteen years ago. The mastermind, Yuan Shikai, is undoubtedly guilty. As for whether Nie Dianbang was the murderer in the case, it cannot be determined without a detailed investigation. It is planned to investigate the lawyer who handled the case, the confessions of the suspects obtained after the case occurred, and the fingerprints at the time. After the evidence has been gathered, headquarters can begin the trial.</p>

The mountains and rivers he passes through are all embodied in his poems, expressing his repressed feelings of melancholy. The value of Wu's poetry manuscript can be imagined from these few words. After months of effort, it has recently been completed. Each volume costs two dimes in foreign currency to cover paper and printing costs.

<p>Movie star Wang Hanlun, previously noticed that the Great Southeast Tobacco Company of this city had, without her consent, used her name and image to manufacture "Wang Hanlun" brand cigarettes, which were sold in areas such as Hebei and Tianjin. Believing this to be a deliberate infringement of her rights to her name and image, she entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit against the Great Southeast Company with the Shanghai French Concession Court, seeking compensation for damage to her reputation and an end to the infringement. The first instance judgment found that the cigarettes in question were produced by the Jianhua Tobacco Company and that the lawsuit should have been filed against Jianhua. The lawsuit against the Great Southeast Company was dismissed due to the wrong party being sued. Dissatisfied with the judgment, Ms. Wang engaged lawyer Dong Chi to file an appeal according to the law. The appeal detailed the errors in the original judgment. Upon learning of the appeal, the Great Southeast Company had someone approach Ms. Wang to seek a settlement. After several negotiations, Ms. Wang agreed. A formal settlement agreement was signed on January 17th. The main terms of the settlement were: (1) The Great Southeast Company would compensate Ms. Wang for losses and legal fees, totaling four thousand yuan. (2) The company would immediately cease the production and sale of "Wang Hanlun" brand cigarettes, and any existing stock would be destroyed. If the company continued to produce and sell the cigarettes in the future, Ms. Wang would have the right to seek an end to the infringement and receive appropriate compensation. (3) The plaintiff would immediately submit a statement to the French Concession Court to withdraw the appeal, demonstrating a determination to settle the dispute.</p>

<p>Fu Guoxi and others confess without denial.</p>
<p>Another suspect, Wang A'da, was arrested yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, detectives Su Sheng, Wang Shifu, Lü Xingchun, Chen Jiren, and others from the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau solved the robbery case of the Lao Baohe Jewelry Store at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Datong Road in Zhabei. The criminals Fu Guoxi, Huang Dianchen (also known as "Little Pig Head"), and Zhang Yangzhi were arrested, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Captain Lu believes that, given the series of robbery cases during the winter prevention period, strict interrogation of the arrested criminals is necessary to deter others. The team ordered the foreman to strictly apprehend the remaining suspects and brought Fu Guoxi to No. 124 Jiaotong Road, where Wang A'da was arrested. The confessions of the criminals are summarized below:</p>
<p>Fu Guoxi (also known as Fu Xiaoxizi) confessed: 29 years old, from Funing, works as a vegetable farmer. At 10:00 AM today, Zheng San, Huang Dianchen, Zhang Yangzhi, and I went to Xibaoxing Road and identified a cloth store. At 5:00 PM, Huang Dianchen and I took a loaded pistol to the store to rob it. We were arrested at Pingjiang Bridge. I, Zheng San, Huang Dianchen, Zhang Yangzhi, Xiao Bazi, Li Sangenbao, and others also robbed the jewelry store on the east side of the Zhabei Dayang Bridge. We stole over one hundred yuan, 34 catties of silverware, and a sheepskin robe. We divided the loot in an open space behind the Jianghuai Public Hall. I received 18 yuan and over six catties of silverware. Huang Dianchen (also known as "Little Pig Head") confessed: 24 years old, from Funing, works as a rickshaw puller. Today at 4:00 PM, Fu Xiaoxizi and I went to the Xibaoxing Road vegetable market to rob a cloth store and handed me a loaded pistol. I, Fu, and several strangers, a total of seven people, robbed the jewelry store on the east side of the Dayang Bridge and obtained 12 yuan and a bag of loose silver, which Fu Xiaoxizi exchanged. Zhang Yangzhi confessed: 30 years old, from Funing, works as a rickshaw puller. I know Zheng San and Huang Dianchen. Huang and others invited me to stay at their house and advised me to sell candy instead of pulling a rickshaw, saying that pulling a rickshaw was too hard. I replied that I had no capital. They said they would go out with me the next day and help me. They said I could stand guard outside. In the afternoon, Zheng San and others invited me to Fu Xiaoxizi's house in Zhujiamiao, Zhabei, and we went to Baohe Jewelry Store on the east side of Dayang Bridge (Zhongshan Road) to rob it. We found it was closed, so we dug a hole in the wall of a newly built house next door. Zheng San first entered, followed by Fu Xiaoxizi and three strangers. Ji San and I stood guard outside. I received ten yuan in stolen goods. At 5:00 PM on the 22nd afternoon, Zheng San came to my house again and called me, Fu Xiaoxizi, and Little Pig Head to take two pistols and go to Xibaoxing Road to rob a cloth store. We were inspected and arrested at the Shuimuting Bridge. Zheng San escaped immediately. Another suspect, Wang A'da, was apprehended, and is currently under strict interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e203">New Efforts <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Daoyuan</p>
<p>Last time our school held an exhibition, it actually gained the attention of the general public, which made us very happy. We already know that the public's demand for art and the passion for art have not diminished. The public's attitude towards our efforts has not been unconscious, nor has it been met with scorn and ridicule. This alone is enough for us to put down our heavy brushes and feel quite relieved. What's more, there are art lovers who have given us kind words of encouragement and endless motivation. In addition to expressing our gratitude, we can only hold on to our future and work even harder to exchange our entire energy for the extremely bright future of art. This is our current ambition, which depends on the efforts of our entire art community.</p>
<p>Since returning to China, I have been buried in Jiangwan Road, spending all day with students and colors. Since deciding to build our own school building, my mind has been filled with things like wood, bricks, and tiles, and I seem to be busy enough. I have never said a word about the domestic art scene and my own work. Now that I have picked up my pen, I have to say something.</p>
<p>Everything from last year has become the past. In this new year, we should naturally make some new efforts. The object of our current demands, ostentation and embellishment, seems to have lost its authority. What we hope for is a great soul that melts us in a painting. However, where the brush should stop and where the mind should lift its head are not easy decisions in painting. In short, a painting with a sublime and rich thought, no matter how rough and ugly it is, will always be more valuable than a delicate and skillful work that lacks content. Therefore, John Ruskin has this to say: The best article and the best picture should be declared in all the things that can be moved and decorated on the dignity contained within it, but when it reaches the most excellent state, these things are still useless... We prefer the simple words and lines that can trigger an idea in its original beautiful state.</p>
<p>Now we know that the life of a painter lies in the internal majesty of his work, and external exquisite gorgeousness is not the goal we are pursuing. At the same time, we should clarify our minds and find our painting materials from the contradictory background of the current society.</p>
<p>The era has come to us. We should firmly grasp our brushes and make the "force" of art the vanguard of the era. Our painters, our "force"!</p>
<p>Speaking of our school, the Shanghai Art College, at this moment, can be regarded as an art group that is fighting with the times. Although it has only one year of history, its efforts over the past year have been presented to the public, and it is unwilling to boast too much about itself. Its future situation can only be expressed through its own actual work. Actual work is its content. We don't need much exaggeration and external decoration. We especially want to smash the kind of unchanging so-called academic style of regressive traditional forces.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that this year, our school has a social art service to create a strong artistic atmosphere, which must start from this effort. The first of these efforts must start from the painting education of children. We firmly believe that:</p>
<p>With such a decision, our neighboring elementary schools will be voluntarily receiving their art education from us, giving full interest to the drawing courses that have always been neglected, so that the boundless children's minds can be clearly expressed, and the small and skillful hands can be reflected in nature. What a divine and wonderful thing! The creation of an artistic children's world, what a great success for the art world!</p>
<p>Let's look at our neighboring country, Japanese painters. Since advocating the free painting movement for children, what satisfactory results have they obtained? They shouted loudly there,</p>
<p>"We aim to make our art the most trend-following thing, and feel that this thing must start from the painting education of children." With this, the impact was great, and all places gave sympathy and support, so a lively new scene appeared in Japanese art education.</p>
<p>Now we should not be behind others and do the same.</p>
<p>Indeed, "beauty" is such a thing that implies the secrets of nature and inspires profound wisdom. If you rely solely on the imitation of models or the teaching of masters, then "beauty" will ultimately degenerate.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the drawing class hours in elementary schools in our country are considered not very important subjects. How the results are, the school does not pay much attention to it, as if it is a dispensable thing, but it is only brought to decorate it. The teachers mostly give them a model to copy and perfunctorily spend one or two hours, so the children also feel bored. Now the most important thing for us is to abolish the copybooks and let the children express themselves directly. We firmly believe that the shapes and colors that children directly absorb from "nature" must be more interesting than copying the crude printed adult paintings.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, in children's painting, the perception and feeling are different from those of adults. Children have their own observations and emotions. The professor can only explain it to enlighten them, and must not let them blindly follow the works of the model. What is especially important is to make the children hold a kind of power, so that the children can freely describe the object and fully exert their own perceptions, which is to make him expand his own power towards nature.</p>
<p>Copybooks are a withered and lifeless thing. The hearts and hands of children are full of vitality. It is such a boring thing to bind lively hearts and hands with a withered tool.</p>
<p>Here we know that that kind of imitative copying can only create an immutable inferior nature of imitation in children, and the immeasurable creativity is suppressed.</p>
<p>However, the country is flooded, and almost all elementary schools are doing copybook life, and the so-called educators do not care about the lack of progress in art education. As for the training of painting, how important a relationship it has with the cultivation of "beauty" for children, they have never dreamed of. This is very bleak for the future of art education.</p>
<p>Now we are determined to work hard in this area, and hope that enthusiastic educators will teach me.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Talking about the First Exhibition of the Japanese Independent Art Association <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yong</p>
<p>The Japanese Independent Art Association was formed by seceding from the Nikakai. I said last year that the first exhibition opened on January 11, 1931. Independent art, in Japan, is indeed independent. I dare say that in the Japanese art world, although it is not as successful as the Nikakai, the art group, in addition to the Nikakai, is the Independent Art Association, which started following 1930, that can be hoped to resist the Imperial Art Academy. Even in the works of this first exhibition, we can clearly see the aspirations of their members. Of course, many people who saw it said that all the works selected by the newcomers were not worth seeing. This is the truth, but this is just a one-sided attack. But the efforts of the members' responsibilities are indeed efforts, and some writers' works have made more progress than before.</p>
<p>The works in the entire venue are all post-impressionist, Fauvist groups, using yellow, green, red, and black as the main silver colors. The brushstrokes are impulsive, the screens are symbolic, and the objects are only used as the outlines of their screens. Such works in Japan, even in the Eastern art world, do have the possibility of independence.</p>
<p>The selected works are mostly encouraging new entrants to promote the new Fauvist group, I think.</p>
<p>Tanaka Kinuyo is the first actress whose work was selected for a Japanese art exhibition. This is not a strange thing in the atmosphere of emerging art. Now the era is new, and art is the guide of the new era. They have such a declaration,</p>
<p>"Art needs the support of the public, and the established art world, at first, did not pay attention to the works of female writers. If you only take a look at it, it is also good."</p>
<p>Mr. Katsuzo Satomi said, "The bell does not ring, the masses will not leave. Has that bell been heard?"</p>
<p>Mr. Shigeyoshi Hayashi said, "Fresh works are pleasant, and the tendency is definitely biased towards the New Fauvism. There are various colors, but the avoidance of different colors is done in this way. There are many female works selected."</p>
<p>The works of realism and naturalism from the past can be seen to be broken. The rules of qualifications have all been destroyed. When we step into their venue, we will know very clearly with our eyes, strange postures, stimulating screens, irregular lines, licentious colors, mechanical beauty expression, and scientific depiction. We will definitely be surprised when we see it. Mr. Zenzo Kojima's "Independent Art Debut" screen is five nude women, and the one in the middle is the symbol of independent art. The two next to them are independent art writers, one wearing clothes for them and one wearing decorations for them, making them beautiful, making them magnificent, and making them charming. The purple background, we can naturally feel is noble, and the bright eyes lead the footsteps to find the road to light. The other works all have very pleasant brushstrokes, simple colors, and uncomplicated compositions, which are well worth our appreciation.</p>
<p>The scientific and mechanical description of Ichiro Fukuzawa is the most obvious. Whether the screen or the title of the painting is a mysterious comedy, satirizing the world, and comparing life.</p>
<p>Rouault is the most famous of modern New Fauvism. Many of the works in this independent art exhibition are similar to his, with unlined brushstrokes and crazy tones, expressing the most beautiful ugliness of the world. The works of Katsuzo Satomi are so similar. Mr. Satomi can be regarded as the Eastern Rouault.</p>
<p>The works of Kigaigawa have poetic sentiment, three-dimensional lines, a quiet yet frantic tone, and irregular outlines, which will truly make us tremble in silence when we see them.</p>
<p>The works of Takeshi Hayashi were initially an allusion to Matisse, but now they have gone to the outline of Matisse. The colors are very clearly distinguished from them.</p>
<p>There are also other works by Shigeyoshi Hayashi, Yasunori Suzuki, Shiro Takada, Afu Suzuki, etc., which are all very noteworthy. They are all pioneers of the new Fauvist group in Japan.</p>
<p>In the Independent Art Exhibition, 271 works were selected from 3,751 works for us to appreciate. It can be understood that this number is not indiscriminate selection.</p>
<p>Their efforts are indeed worthy of being imitated by the art world in our country. It is heard that the domestic art world is not silent, but silent as if dead. This is certainly because the level of art of the Chinese people is too shallow and they despise art too much. But on the other hand, it is that the art world is too irresponsible, which cannot be escaped.</p>
<p>I hope that the Chinese people will at least imitate people's efforts.</p>
