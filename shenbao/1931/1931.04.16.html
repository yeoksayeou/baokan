<p>西班牙今已宣布共和。廢除王位。世界又少一君主國。矣近年以來。厭棄議會政治之國家。每每趨向於極端左右兩方面。於是識者遂引爲民治前途危。然其實大多數之人民。固皆向民治潮流而趨者也。歐洲自意大利棒喝黨施行獨裁制以後。西班牙首先做行。西自一八七六年宣布君主立憲以來。内閣迭更。政變屢起。里夫拉遂起而實行獨裁政治。認意大利之獨裁制。爲救時萬應良藥。在當時亦未嘗無小效。然不久人民即苦專制之束縛。自由之被剥奪。紛起爲倒閣運動。里夫拉竭盡種種方法。冀有以壓平人民这反抗。但愈壓而人民之反抗愈力。革命潮流。瀰漫全國。終至不能維持而倒。是時西王猶未覺悟。任貝倫圭將軍爲首相。貝氏雖以革新政治爲號召。而其實仍繼續里夫拉之獨裁政策。復以無法維持而退。繼任之亞士那。見局勢已危。急欲避去獨裁之名。思以趕辦改選修憲。緩和全國之人心。保全君主政治之局面。然此時之人心。已皆一致趨向共和。非特獨裁制不能維持。即君主政體。亦已至於萬難維持之勢。欲支撑而無可支撑。此所以不得已而有今日西王退位之舉也。此次西班牙改組共和之後。雖未知其能否永久。惟此獨裁制。經長時期試騐之後。當必不再復活。蓋民主政治。今已成爲不可抵抗之潮流。即一時被一部分獨裁勢力所種動。而人心終必順應此大勞而趨。故西班牙之共和前途縱不免尙有多少困難與障礙。而其結果之必歸成功。殆亦可以預測者歟。</p>

<p>國民十四日瑪德里電西班牙王以舉國傾向共和、潮流所趨、難以抵禦、遂毅然遜位、離國他適、此種消息、今日淸晨即已傳遍全城、然猶未能證實、迨下午六時左右、外相羅滿拿斯親訪共和黨領袖柴摩拉氏、告以國王已經遜位、並將國璽大權正式授與柴氏、少頃柴氏即召集本國及外國新聞記者正式通告亞方朔王業已遜位、王族已赴巴黎、於是西班牙共和政體遂經正式宣佈、新内閣亦已宣告成立、内計總理柴摩拉、財長柏理篤、外長勒羅斯、陸軍阿雅拉、海軍魁洛、内長茅拉、司法羅斯理歐斯、工務杜氏哥、勞工加巴勒洛、交通巴里沃斯、國府秘書古拉、西王遜位消息一經傳出、舉國若狂、瑪德里及其他各地人民、皆在街道狂呼慶祝、工人學生等則羣起作示威游行之舉、或執社會黨之紅旗、或執共和黨之紅黄紫三色旗、各地旣已同時宣告共和政體成立、各公家房屋兵房砲壘等即一律更換新旗、人民歡呼慶賀者如山如海、巴塞洛那城中且有暴動發生、其原因尙未明瞭、大約係西班牙共和黨之中央集權派與加泰蘭共和自主派衝突所致、而瑪备里本身則猶在如醉如狂之中、居民皆自窗中將國王像·王室及專制時代之一切表記用品擲出、以便在公衆塲所舉火慶祝、此次所組新閣包含保守黨·天主敎徒共和黨·社會黨、黨派紛岐、無所不具、說者謂爲過渡内閣、將來選舉國會制定憲法之後、尤有一番新氣象發見也、　　國民社十四日瑪德里電今日深夜臨時政府在市政廳宣布西班牙第二共和國之成立、第一次共和政體、自一八七三年至一八七四年存在僅一年、共和政府成立後、第一道命令即爲赦免一切政治犯、第二道命令通告全國維持安寗、第三道命令即召國廢王所任命之一切大使公使等、並已宣布四月十五日爲國慶日、</p>

<p>三、生計敎育、主張打破學校武之慣習、改辦生産機關式之職業敎育、例如各縣現正興辦農場、應就農場辦理初級農業學校、省立工場應謀恢復、各縣設立模範工場、即就工場設工業訓練班、</p>
<p>四師範敎育、爲推行義敎之本、現時質量數量苟經濟上時間上不能兼顧、應先擴充數量、設法奬勵、並規定服務年限、實行年功加俸、</p>

<p>陣線已定</p>
<p>中華全國體育協進會主辦之本屆上海慈善足球賽、定星期日（十九日）下午三時在中華棒球場舉行、足球季行將告别、此偉大而兼公益之中西球賽作爲閉幕禮之點綴、是亦値得吾人之欣　也、</p>
<p>中華隊之陣綫</p>
<p>中華隊陣綫至今尙未正式發表、據吾人所知、已内定爲獲得本屆萬國足球錦標之中華隊、其中或以境况關係面須　動者、亦未可知、若左内鋒之羅海光、前爲華東隊服務、受傷人院醫治、現雖不藥而愈、能否仍爲中華効勞、一疑問也、然而陳洪光矯癒可取、不難起而代之、最困難之要點、即今日中華隊之中堅人才、陳鎭和固爲適當人物、顧此君身列前鋒、有舉足輕重之慨、難以棄彼就此、莊世鴻傷痕未全、安可再行馳聘、李寗非其所習、安能削足就履、然則吾人惟馮運佑是賴耳、陳家球之右前衛、較佳於右内鋒、如果兩光、（即羅海光陳洪光）左右並列、則陳家球將表演其稱心傑作矣、下列陣綫、實爲最近之最佳者、必能予吾人良好之成績也、</p>

<p>連得本年三大錦標之西捕隊、業允爲本屆中西慈善賽主角之一、内幕人物、亦經佈露、據專家考察所得、全隊人才、平均優越、逐一介紹、作爲中華健兒之參考、兵法所謂知已知彼、百戰百勝也、守門大將、名曰勃拉特萊、其人才能稍遜於周賢言、然在西人界中、允稱巨擘、格伯遜史谷脫二人、担任左右兩内衛、在最近幾次比賽中、已予吾人「堅硬可靠」之信仰、中衛綫惠斯烏軋許赫電、乃全隊最有力量之集中點、本季戰無不勝、攻無不克、功在此綫、前鋒喔克萊·傑克·法拉斯·透納·衛金生稱爲海上五虎、體力健、脚頭硬、他日相見、當知其身手矣、</p>

<p>船員查悉失踪者已有七人</p>
<p>責任問題俟海關查明再辦</p>
<p>大華公司大昌輪、前晚八時半、在吳淞口外被平安公司出口輪大華號撞沉一節、已誌昨報、茲將昨日所得消息分錄於後、　　肇禍情形前晚（十四）八時三十分、大昌輪自大埔裝載中興煤礦公司煤六百噸、及乘客約六七十人來滬、其時行至離吳淞口約二十里、第二河　時、見大華輪出口、直駛而來、大是即拉回聲、一面轉舵向北避讓、遂爲大華輪船頭所撞、砰然一聲、遂肇鉅禍矣、</p>
<p>船主求救大昌輪爲避讓大華輪、故船首已折向北、致被大華攔　　腰右舷猛撞、適中機艙、洞穿後、立時浸水、逐漸下沉、船主儀人把克（譯音）（ＮＢＯＹＫＯ）見船被撞後、擬將船駛進邊岸、便於救護乃機器已損輪舵失去效力、乃遂抛錨、一面放流星求救、大華肇禍後因在黑夜、仍向前行駛、後見星流求救、即調頭施救、</p>
<p>救旗情形當出事時、適無一船出入、雖放火箭、亦無船應救、九時許、大華開回靠近抛錨、放下舢舨數只、大昌輪船員及乘客、得絡續過船、約百餘人、其時已十點鐘許、大昌已全船沉没、大華輪遂開回吳淞、於昨晨駛滬、遭難者在南市碼頭上陸、</p>
<p>乘客被救該輪自大埔儎煤外、尙有乘客六七十人、大都均極貧苦、間有無家可歸者、來滬謀工、被救出者亦有三四十人、故到滬後均離船他去、未至公司報告、以致究竟救起及夫落幾人、尙不知確數、</p>
<p>船員檢查該輪全船共計六十四人、除出險者外、尙少買辦龐金全·二買辦王永耀·三軌汪品生·木匠陳丕根·生火徐淸蘭·加油雲仁·廚司天來·等七人、均無下落、</p>
<p>善後辦法該輪船員被救到滬者、均至公司報告、並詢問善後辦法、又有木匠陳丕根之妻嚴氏、亦到公司、向公司索人、頓足哭泣、雖旁人勸戒、終歸無效、各職員辦事、亦因之均無頭緒、後由職員姚仲軒、給水手頭目湯某洋七十五元、命先發給該水手部工人、每名五元、暫作膳宿費、對於損失一成、允三日後定有辦法、各工人因口頭之言不能作信、乃於姚君書面忍認、始各散去、陳丕根妻嚴氏、尙不首肯、乃由同德輪主閔辛吾君勸告、乃取五元而去、</p>
<p>交涉手續大華公司、對於大昌被撞沉没情形、由船主報告後、即函致海關及航業公會、一面委托席裕昌律師、進行交涉、平安公司亦托有律師、昨日已有信札往還、以作通知性質、尙未提起損失問題、</p>
<p>責任問題大華與大昌互撞之責任、經國聞社記者向雙方調查、各執其稅、據大昌言、該輪幣見大華綠燈、即向左避成一百二十角度、其時如大華亦能向右稍避、决不致相撞也、無奈該輪直行不避、致彼船首觸於大昌船腹、不可救援云云、據大華言、該輪見船已近、立即煞車、並抽救命回聲四響以告、詎知來者並不煞車、反欲趨繞大華船首左側捷行、以致彼之船腹、觸於我首、情詞各執、難證是非、諒不久經海關澈查後、必可水落石出也、</p>
<p>二輪略歷大昌輪爲本埠公館馬路四十一號大華公司之産、儎重爲一千六百噸、建造有年、專儎貨物、于上月二十五日起、租與中興煤礦公司、經漢口路悅來公司内信诚誠行報關、行駛大埔上海間、專儎煤斤、中興接手後、至前晚失事止、祇行駛二次、遂肇此禂、對于损失、當併入大昌交涉、該輪事前、由大華公司在華安公司、保險五萬兩、但尙不及損失之半、大華輪爲平安公司之定海班、儎重六百噸、前晚興大昌衝撞後、救護百餘人、昨晨回滬、因船頭亦略受傷、故暫時停航修理、所有客貨等、于今日轉儎穿山輪裝往云、</p>
<p>打撈尸身該輪除救起船員乘客百餘人外、尙有落水者四五十人、該公司爲打撈屍身起見、昨日致函吳淞救生局、請求打撈、並出賞格每名四十元、致救生局函云、逕啓者、茲有大昌輪于昨晚八時三十分鐘、在吳淞口外、被大華輪撞沉、所有大昌輪船員、除出險者外、尙少船員七人、不知下落、用特函請貴局、代爲四處尋覓、如有撈得屍身、與該船員姓名相符者、每名賞給洋四十元、歸敝公司按名照數發給、决不食言、特此通告、即希查照爲荷、</p>

<p>納稅西人年會</p>
<p>全體通過議案共七件</p>
<p>購買大華飯店案否决</p>
<p>公共租界納稅西人年會、昨日下午二時正在大光明戲院舉行由工部局總董麥克那登氏、將工部局制成之議案共八件、一一提出、交大會表决、先推定白克爾君爲年會主席、傳萊啓君爲秘媾、一小時内、全體通過議案共七件、至討論第八件購買大華飯店案、全塲空氣、陡然緊張、該案由哈理斯君提議、費吳生君附議、開始討論後、登臺演說反對者五人、贊成者一人、旋付大會表决、卒以大多數之反對、各界注意之工部局購買大華飯店案、遂遭否决、將爲下午三時四十分、旋散會、茲將會議詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>第（一）（二）（三）案即推舉主席與秘書、及通過會塲規則旣畢、即由總董麥克那登提議</p>
<p>第四案「通　過一九三○年十二月三十一日爲止之一年度市政報告與决算案」、麥氏起作提案報告、略謂、去年工部局所辦各項市政、業已詳載年報、茲謹擇其較重要者、附加數語、諒諸君猶憶前年六月間工部局聘請克禮阿君、襄助實施、</p>
<p>節用委員會建議、並加入薪俸委員會工作、擔任書記、迨去年六月、薪俸委員會缮送報告書、規劃偉大、計慮周詳、工部局祇將其中三數點稍予變更、即行採用、而所變更者、亦仍與該委員會用意相脗合、祗方法不同而已、工部局現已有一完善之薪俸等級表、純以功籟爲升級基礎、該委員會曾建議在職責較重各位置上、開啟一華員服務途徑、工部局深表贊同、今後用人方針、將俟不能獲得相當華員時、始行聘用西人、工部局深覺採用薪俸委員會報告後、在撙節政費上、必能大有裨益、謹當對於諸委員服務公衆之賢勞、致其謝忱、此外克禮阿君、又對於薪俸委員會之建議、制定實施辦法、而對於工部局辦事規章、亦多所改良、向來市政之管理與職權、集中於總辦、今以地方發達、市政日繁、不免有政務叢脞、辦事滯緩之虞、克禮阿君現已改訂各處主任之職權、俾與其所增之責任相配稱、又集合數處、組成聯席委員會若干組、直接處理有關該數處之事務、藉省總辦處居開諮詢文書往返之煩、如此、旣不妨礙管理之效能、又可大省人員、而行政則頓見敏捷、此外又修改關於董事會委員會及各處所之辦事規程、一掃往日職權不淸之弊、嗣後行政、大爲便利、以上種種艱鉅工作、克氏已於三月間完成、董事會完全滿意、而工部局與公衆亦大獲其益、去年納稅人年會時、對於</p>
<p>上海特區地方法院曾有最悲觀</p>
<p>之論調、一部份西報、亦在外橋間、造成一種廣播之印象、以爲取消臨時法院、代以特區法院、無異一種災禍、使西人之權利與西人利益之保障、爲政治上便利而犧牲、今日鄙人甚樂爲諸君告者、一年來特區法院在刑事方面、辦理極有效能、一年前西人所懷之疑懼、現已什九消釋、諸君皆知租界中之治安與秩序、擊於特區法院之刑事行政者極大、去年工部局控告之大小刑事案件、定罪者占百分之九三·一、是年工部局起訴之刑事案、共二零八八三起、内科刑者一九、四五七人、免釋者一、四二六人、就上海情形而論、此實可視爲一種紀錄、與各國刑事法庭行政相較、有過而無不及、此外對於特區法院之執行刑法上、亦絶少不滿意處、惟去年在</p>
<p>越界築路問題未能有何進步、良用遺憾、直至最近、始與中國地方當道商定一辦法、希望將來藉此可以維持路面、時加修理、至於　　電話問題自上海電話公司承購華洋德律風公司營業財産、於去年八月五日、與工部局公董局簽訂合同、取得特許權、規定迅速加以整頓、限兩年内、全部改裝自働電話、須俟此層辦竣、始准增加電話費、今年二月底、曾接公司報告工作情形、向國際電話電報公司兩廠訂購之自働電話四萬三千具、已運到百分之六十、現正在工程充分完成之接線間内、從事裝置、畢勛路與提籃橋兩處房屋、業已完工、福建路一所、即將落成、敏體尼蔭路一所、已成百分之九十、西區及北區兩所、亦造成百分之八十五、敷線工程、已在馬路間造成人穴一五二所、埋管一四一一○○尺、敷設地下與天空電纜五七二四○○呎、其中話線共長五六四五○哩、惟在租界外改裝新設備、因常遭中國黨道之干涉、工部局已准其對於界外馬路方面、免除合同規定之義務、</p>
<p>去年工部局决算及會計處報告</p>
<p>前已發表、茲再就數要點、略加詮釋、查去年經常　餘二、二七一、○○○兩、比預算三、二七七、○○○兩竟减少一百萬兩有奇、其原因已具見會計處報告、而銀價之跌、實爲最大原因、去年捕房經費、占全部歲入百分之在十六、蓋採用薪俸委員會若干建議後、已使警衛經費增加於前、内以華捕受惠較多、然此項經費雖鉅、而公衆實蒙其利、諒諸君當亦以斯言爲然、至關於</p>
<p>推廣敎育部題查去年歲入之用於敎育者、占百分之四·六、（屬於投資性質之開支不在内、）但自採用敎育委員會建議後、自本年起、其百分比數將大見增加、工部局現共辦學按十三所、敎育華童者七所、敎育外　者六所、去年底共有華籟學生三、二八一人、但仍有許多學生因校舍不敷、未克錄取、外籍學生則共一、五三六人、内有數校校舍、儘有餘地、再可容納多人、至西區添設敎育西童新校一節、雖不能有所進行、但工部局方注全力於希望不久即可有切實步驟、去年六月間成立敎育委員會以來、已擬有擴充公立學校及補助私立學校程序、工部局在原則上業已通過、此外尙有一端、須請諸君特别注意者、即會計處報告所述、</p>
<p>電氣處售價處分情形是、自工部局出售電氣處後、外間頗有一種感想、以爲市庫得此偌大收入後、可以取之無盡、用之不竭、故請諸君特别注意此項報告、俾明眞相、袪除謬誤印象、鄙人又有欲爲諸君告者、倘電氣處不出售、則目下巡捕捐地稅、不特不能减輕、且將增至百分之二十矣、至特别收支門、共　餘三、三四四、七一一兩、比預算二、三八二、七○○兩、約增九六二、○○○兩之譜、去年上海電力公司共付購價二三五○○、○○○兩、工部局即用以贖回十種市公債、（一九二○年之金鎊借欵亦在其列）、及應付各項投資性質之開支、惟原定之建築房屋程序、未能完全實行、即以其所省之欵、撥出一部份、移充放寛馬路所需購地經費、蓋是年界内翻造房屋、有異常之發展、致放寛馬路經費亦隨之激增也、茲謹提出第四案、敬請公决、主席遂以本案付表决、衆無異議通過、</p>
<p>第五案「請通過卸任董事會所編一九三一年度預算案内各項開支、及其附帶建議、並授權工部局徴收案中所列各項捐稅案」、並向衆宣稱、本年之預算案、後附有說明、將今昨兩年收支各項、一一比較、故今除提述重要之一二點外、無庸重加細述、本年租界内中外房屋之巡捕捐、仍如去年下半年按租金征收百分之十四、界外者征收百分之十二、地稅仍照估値價收千分之七、預算䞉餘之數、爲銀三十一萬兩、而上年䞉餘、則有二百二十七萬一千兩之多、</p>
<p>經常預算案收支足以相抵、本年不必增加捐稅、堪以告慰、第䞉餘過少、未免美中不足、此或由於銀價大落、使預算案各項、受直接與間接影響所致、猶憶上年鄙人在年會中所發之演說、　曾謂工部局希望目下捐稅之低李、得維持若干年、工部局今雖仍具此望、但匯率如不於最近之將來有實在之進步、則恐延至明年、復須恢復去年七月以前所實施捐稅之率矣、關於此節、　衆或未盡知上海之捐稅、大約低於歐美任何各大城、例如英國、輙按租金收百分之七十左右、而英國之市政局、除所收之市捐外、猶往往受政府之津貼、以興辦某種公共事務、本年之　　特别預算案預計將短少三十五萬零七百五十兩、而去年則反䞉餘三百三十四萬四千七百兩、此由於本年特别支出共達一千萬兩之譜、而出售電氣處之購價、分若干年繳付、本年所應繳付之數、僅有八百萬兩也、</p>
<p>建造房屋程序佔特别預算案之重大部分、有許多房屋、雖列入去年預算案、而工未告竣、不得不續撥經費、以完成之、邇以匯率低落、入口之營造材料、價皆騰漲、建造房屋程序需費較高、此亦一種原因也、相機</p>
<p>收買土地放寛馬路政策、擬賡續進行、自近今重估地價後、放寛馬路所需經費、又須視前大增矣、</p>
<p>償債項下、規定　　一九三一年八釐公債、及按批儲存償債金、以供一九三三年十三月三十一日以前所不能贖還各債之用、因電氣處購價末批之欵、須至是日始能付淸也、</p>
<p>敎育政策之程序、前由敎育委員會革定、經工部局贊成者、業經公布、無庸陳述、其中規定在一九三四年之前創設中國女子中學二所、並在本年與一九二八年之間、每年建設男女合授之華童小學兩所、又規定津貼工部局所認爲應予資助之私立中外學校辦法、按照此項程序、至一九三八年年底、租界内將有公立華童學校二十三所、預計屆時公立各校、能容租界内已達學齡之華童百分之七左右、預算案所列此項程序本年所需之費、爲比較的小數、要知今日所請諸君贊成之華　敎育經費、仍較公立西童學校經費、相差甚遠、而敎育經費之總數、（内有十五萬兩、乃撥存以供津貼各校之用者）則佔工部局收入百分之九弱、諸君當知今後每年將請納稅人贊成逐步增加華童敎育經費、至一九三八年、（除非有意外事故遏止或增速吾人之進行）、敎育經費或將佔工部局收入百分之十六左右、鄙人敢料諸君必慨然贊成本年之經費、藍華童人數雖超過西童甚巨、而本年所佔工部局規定敎育費之利益、猶足全數之半、故實無理由可以靳而不許也、且今日諸君之贊成、毫不能剥奪今後納稅人令止需用之權、鄙人深信將來之納稅人必亦能如諸君之明亮、而知本租界責當以進步的敎育機會貢諸界内華人兒童也、工部局爲使中外纳稅人明白公共敎育所需之經費計、决議此後將敎育預算案在市政費會計内另立一項、至　措敎育費之方法、是否出諸特捐、抑另籌他計、將於日後討論之云云、宣言畢、主席　本案付表决、由全塲一致通過、</p>
<p>第六案公舉本年度地産委員一人、羅賓生當選、</p>
<p>第七案公舉本年度公濟醫院値年董事四人、白醫生、鄧醫生、卡杰、與歇巴德四人當選、</p>
<p>第八案、提議收購大華地産、内容「提議由公家爲市民收購大華飯店地産、充公園及社交中樞之用、祗須其售價經工部局認爲合理、而同時市庫財力、尙能在人口較密地方、增闢必要曠塲、便予實行、敬候公决」、由哈理斯提出、並向衆演說、略謂、工部局未爲事吾人購置曠地、已十七年、其間工部局收入增加三倍、南京路市政廳售去、又得一百二十五萬兩、該欵存爲建造新市政廳之用、現在良機已到、如失之交臂、足爲工部局鑄成大鍇、大華飯店、世界聞名、亦公共租界足以自詡者也、大華地産、約六十畝、交通便利、予所建議者、爲將大華飯店改造爲市政廳、以供年會及音樂會之用、更建美術館、以及圖書館、現今之跳舞廳、則與以保存、另闢游泳池、及露天影戲塲、大華地産價値三百五十萬兩、平均每畝六萬兩、其鄰近之地、今已售出、價値每畝十二萬五千兩、一倍於大華地産索價、大華飯店所有房屋、概不作價、故改造或保留、並無犧牲、今贊成此議者、已有十餘團體云、附議人費吳生君、即由工部局總董麥克那登起稱、工部局對於此議、已在各報發表意見、工部局之切實反對此議者、以爲就有效力的市行政觀察點而言、實屬理由充足、工部局凡考慮此類事件、首先注意之一點、當然爲購得一種特殊産業、是否能溥益全體居民問題、工部局凡决定動用巨欵之任何計劃、輒分别輕重、　爲大衆所願、而事非必要者、則即不之釁辦、主張購買大華地産者、所發之種種議論、大都爲情感所鼓動、而對於鞏固之財政與利益二端、則等閒置之、故一大部居民之所以企望購買大華地産、以爲娱樂之所也、乃屬情感作用、顯無疑義、今對於動用巨欵、以事此舉、旣未提出充分之理由、而對於日後購得此地、實行發展、以供市用、在財力上能否永留該地一大部分、專供娱樂之用、亦無實在之保障、且有人建議將來市政機關可以移至該處、而留出餘地若干、以充所謂社交中　、與公園、或曠塲之用、要知市政機關移至該處、就經濟與實益論、俱不適宜、此已詳布於衆、無庸　述、至於以此爲社交中樞、匪特耗財過巨、力所難任、而其地　積、亦不敷用、至　爲</p>

<p>公園曠場、就地點與　積論、亦不適用、如果出此、亦僅有益於少數比較的富裕之人、而仍不能稍紓租界内貧民稠密各區之公園與　塲急迫之需要、今如購得大華地産、則工部局在居戶調密之區購地以闢公園之舉、不得不爲　　矣、且一且支出三百五十萬兩之巨欵、則以後每年經常豫算案、將增加擔負二十五萬兩左右、其結果或須增徴巡捕捐、以事彌補、此則吾人所當儘力避免者也、麥氏宣言畢、請衆表决本案、費吳生即起立贊助哈理斯之意見、並作簡短之演說、嗣麥氏復起立對於哈氏所稱工部局已十七年未爲納稅人所購買曠地等語、略加反駁、末謂工部局董事會决計不主張購買大華地産、次由日董福島起立矯正哈理斯誤解其談話之數點、次由納稅美人維爾瑪起立反對此議、詞頗激昂、謂渠愛跳舞、大華誠華美之跳舞所、渠知哈氏亦愛跳舞、藎渠嘗見哈氏出入該所也、惟工部局非以劇塲爲業者、吾人無此娱樂之所、固不妨事云云、次由日本人各路聯合會會長林氏及納稅日人井上先後發言反對此議、旋將本案付表决、以反對者居多數、遂否决、</p>

<p>弟以他案亦在囹圄</p>
<p>供述一過滬𫃊𫃊下</p>
<p>庭諭下星期三宣判</p>
<p>嘉禾陳慕陶、任職浙江實業銀行、迄已十四年之久、洊升至儲蓄部副主任要缺、近因陸續侵蝕儲蓄存欵六萬四千元、深慮將來敗露、難辭重咎、乃於本月一日、留書出走、獨赴吳淞、</p>
<p>俟至深宵蹈海不意爲江畔</p>
<p>鐡欄所阻、越而未通、跌倒於地、適所服安眠藥水力發昏厥該處、經人幣見、舁送上海公立醫院、嗣捕房據該行控其侵占、派探將陳移入工部局醫院治愈、始解特區地方法院、業已一度審訊各情、均誌本報、昨晨、由許家栻庭長開第一法庭續審、捕房律師汝保彝、</p>
<p>重將案情陳述一過、浙江</p>
<p>實業銀行延伍守恭律師明對於被告除由捕房公訴外、浙實尙須附帶民訴、請求判令償還侵占之欵、而被告而則延蔣保廉律師辯護、旋由該銀行經理陳選珍投案陳述、謂陳慕陶任職已十有四年、人極誠實、辦事精幹、儲蓄部組織、係正副主任兩員之下、爲領組三員、陳乃</p>
<p>三領組之魁首領組者係一</p>
<p>組之主席腦、職務專司出納欵項、遇副主任因故不能服務、則應由陳庖代、乃陳自十八年秋季起、即利用代理副主任職務、於此期内陸續舞弊、今所查出其侵蝕之數、爲六萬四千元、此外有無其他弊竇、猶未發現、至此次之所以發覺之原因、則緣陳正式擢升副主任、於三月一日受事、彼自料舞弊之賬、月杪交替、必將敗露、遂於四月一日出走、然我初仍未悉舞弊事、直至</p>
<p>彼在吳淞飲酖經人救往公</p>
<p>安局、從其身畔搜出所作之書、方始明瞭云云、隨將賬簿呈案請察、斯時被告陳慕陶即請求法官許其將挪用欵項之經過及一切苦衷縷述、許庭長立准所請、陳乃絮絮自白、謂少讀詩書、粗知禮義、十七歲慈親見背、臨終諄諄以</p>
<p>愛護幼弟相囑我不敢忘、</p>
<p>故此次之事、實因顧全手足所致、洎自十九歲、經親友介紹、薦我入新華銀行服務、不久爲病魔所纏、辭職休養、二十歲、復經人推轂、轉入浙江實業銀行、任職至今、已十四年、自知平日克盡厥職、對於同事以及僕役之輩、無不和洽、曩歲因學生所肇風潮、我當時受剌激甚烈、而索性復愛閱小說、對於三國演義中、</p>
<p>最崇拜劉關張久之不期然</p>
<p>而生性爲小說中之義俠所潛移默化、故無論何人、凡有求於我者、咸如願而賙濟之、雖已力所不及、亦必設法援助也、十八年、我弟賜動、假借父親名義、開設錦康洋貨字號、經營不善、復濫交損友、於是足跡常在各大賭塲、卜晝卜夜、所賭輙負、喪資甚钜、乃時來我處、托詞需欵定貨、乞爲暫墊、我初不知其係耗於賭塲、故屢接濟、致</p>
<p>共墊一萬餘金嗣錦康倒閉</p>
<p>、債主逼迫、我又代償債欵一萬餘元、此外我弟之賭友前來稱貸者、不知凡幾、我亦解囊相助、所耗不资、去年六月間、弟之債主華成綢莊派俞姓　夜來銀行、將我誘去、謂如欲免弟涉訟、速淸債欵、我</p>
<p>又爲償數千元並切勸弟以</p>
<p>後安分、但忠言逆耳、去年下季、弟竟僞造莊票、被人告發、經法庭判處罪刑、現猶在囹圄、當案發時、欲脫弟罪、爲請律師辯護、費用皆由我出、故積至歲尾、我已挪空行欵四萬元、及銀一萬七千七百兩、雖有彌補之心、</p>
<p>奈無點金之術思維無法、</p>
<p>祇得自殺、免累保人、及損毁家聲、遂於四月一日、潛赴吳淞在海濱旅館闢室、作就絶命書、當時曾咯血數口、擬自夜半蹈海、因生平讀書頗多、故將許多書籍、繫於身上、冀入海後、尸體繫有沉重之書、　　不致浮於水面待至夜闌人靜、先將安眠藥片兩瓶溶化吞服、然後步出旅邸、不料旅館門外有鐡欄阻隔、不能越過、仍返旅館就室中遥拜、辭别親故、此時藥力已發、以後如何情狀、因我已昏迷、不能明白、今我死而復活、别無他求、惟有懇庭長與經理先生陳選珍對於</p>
<p>我之犯罪事實特别原諒</p>
<p>、供至此、滬𫃊𫃊下、哽不能聲、許庭長俟其供畢、命開辯論、捕房曁該銀行之律師均請按律治罪、而蔣保廉則聲明被告家屬及其保人刻皆在設法籌欵歸還、請求從寛、庭長嗣諭被告還押、定下星期三宣判、</p>

<p>— 方二</p>
<p>吾友傳君劍先生忽焉怛化。湖湘人士多哀之。旣迎其歸櫬。公致祭弔。又爲之請於省府。優加褒恤。以視歲前老詩人曾重伯先生之死。生而華膴。殁而落漠。誠令人又是一番感想也。茲爲書其一二事。略掳攄余傷舊歎逝之感。</p>
<p>先生字屯艮。醴陵人。生而敏異。有神童之目。工詩文。不諧俗調。善指頭書。勁拔有致。不苟作。得之不易。十三年上期。余與共事某校。一日。爲余誦一絶句云。「不見譚三已半年。勳名知共日中天。何如短笛横牛背。幽谷淸谿足睡眼。」問詩如何。余以爲先生詩。大加贊頌。因云非如先生與譚公有歡。不能下譚三語。又非先生高潔。不能有幽谷淸谿語也。先生曰。此君鄕人新貴某總長未出山時所作也。余爲人誦。皆疑余詩。因相與諧笑久之。</p>
<p>又一日課畢。吾與同事諸君在休憩室閒談。先生忽至。笑呼曰。我被火燒。我被火燒。衆驚起問狀。則徐笑曰。野火燒我。無妨也。自提包中出一捲小報。衆視之。爲湘報副刋野火。執筆者爲汪馥泉章鐡民諸先生。宗旨在倡白話文學。攻古文學。矢的所在。指先生爲南社詩人。又爲古文家。目吳芳吉先生爲八股先生。（時吳同在某校任事）衆矢環焉。堅悍無倫。先先因言文學無論文語。要之求其是而已。吾之夙昔持論如此。獨以詩古文辭攻我。視我爲頑舊。未中的也。然而下江朋友（野火諸人自稱語）素稱滑頭。敢與湖南蠻子硬幹。不怕惹火上身。膽子亦大矣。說罷大笑。衆人皆笑。後來政府中人以野火有煽動學潮嫌疑。暗示湘報中止發行。野火諸君或以爲出自先生授意。實未見先生之廣也。</p>

<p>甘地生於西印度之拉查克地方。Rajkot離孟買不遠。父四十歲以後。始生甘地。七歲。照印度例已娶妻。生性膽小。怕賊怕蛇怕鬼。其膽遠不及其妻。印度敎禁食肉。幼時學吸烟。盜僕人錢。買香烟。後立志悔改。十餘歲曾於一年内食肉若干次。後對母立誓禁絶。十八歲以後。留學英倫。其族制水許出洋。因到外國須與外人同食故也。長老與以破門逐出敎會。蓋印人視同食之重要如此。留英三年。學法律。曾遊巴黎。觀博覽會。及最高之鐡塔。乃引託而斯太譏笑鐡塔之語曰。此物不能表示建築者之智慧。只表其愚蠢耳。因有此即將人精神壓於塔下也。此爲其反對物質之批評。蓋宗託而斯太。而更勇猛者也。託氏又曰。吾等今非小兒。可以此玩物愚弄我也。回國後。於一八九三年當律師於孟買。後到南非洲。因彼處印人不許坐二等車。又無故被白人毆打。遂引起民族自决之觀念。買頭等票。而不許乘頭等車。至販店。印人所在。則白人引而去之。不與共食。甚至有所謂特别法者。在土蘭斯哇爾英屬各地。Transwaal印人不許走公共之道路。夜過九時不許出行。種種荷待。遂發憤指導羣衆。作要求自治運動。從南非印僑做起。在南非三年。返孟買運動甚得力。到加而吉打失敗。乃携家復到南非。白人多毆之。賴警官妻護之得免。及二次從南非返國。僑民贈以金銀金剛石甚多。盡以施與人曰。此贅物耳。一九○一年。歸印度。遊禮鹿野苑各印度廟。向坐三等車。到各地開會運動自治後。再去南非。其運動土人用土貨。各家自勞働。自織布而自用之。甘地自已洗衣。能自剪其髮。甚得力。印度敎信仰之力。其致力在用科學證明素食之效用。不主張階級鬥爭。而用感化也。此自傳僅其上卷。於此終了。仍有下卷。聞才出版也。全卷皆自叙口氣。可與中山自叙克魯泡金自傳并美矣。吾昔年閱某雜志。述其父爲大官者。以此自傳比之。蓋譯述傳聞之錯誤也。其書中得力之印度詩不少。　警句爲盡我本分。雖敗猶榮。其詩多在格達一書中。Gita有英譯本。</p>

<p>昨英美印銀市俱已報升、惟匯兌則降、而滙豐掛牌各滙仍無升縮、形勢極平、内盤初鬆後平、惟金市前萎後堅、終則稍漲二兩左右、然下午已提前開始掉期矣、仍由空頭貼進二兩餘、而匯市因逢週三午後向無市况、惟午刻收盤較前晚計英金長一二五、美金長二五、日金跌一分半、華商加福昌義豐永成豐永福興永等均有抛出、英金約共成交廿萬鎊、銀行若三井胃口較濃、其他匯豐麥行正金台灣等均亦納進、孟買來電稍購、至美金交易寥寥、日金曾扒結數十萬元、乃三井賣出也、</p>
<p>英滙内盤始終平和、上午出價一先令三便士四三七五、買價半便士、三井上海首吸六七月一三半、滙豐買六月同價、又中孚荷囒同價對做五月、三井運通買七月、三井麥行買六月、三井又買本月、正金進六月、三井又進五月、價同爲半便士、中孚出五月同價、（孟買進）、午時三井台灣買七月價仍同、午收平和、</p>
<p>美滙内盤極平、開盤出價三十一元二五、買價三十一元三七五、午收同、</p>
<p>東滙内盤僅以半分上落、早市出價一兩五錢八分、買價七分、三井出五月一兩五錢七分分五、旋後又出四月同價、午收出價仍計一兩五錢八、買價七分云、</p>

<p>邇來銀洋兩種市氣、與替逕庭、銀根以求供均不能自由、結果毫無善狀、轉使殷求而不可能、形勢頓人疲途、銀拆遂無好面可言、洋厘以各埠銷胃大暢、更兼繭需亦在可能範　相機進行、故銷路方面不虞怠懈、是以價格步高、人心益形俏俐也、</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）晨間買戶孔多、人心堅挺、結果暴漲一厘有半、爲七錢二分九厘二毫半、午市又昂一毫二忽半、爲七錢二分九厘三毫七忽半、而開今年創聞之新紀錄、（銀拆）早午兩市統爲白借、銀根奇鬆不堪、劃頭自無向題、</p>
<p>輔幣市情江南小洋早午兩市同爲六錢四分八厘半、較前午小去二厘半做出交易早市六千角、午市四千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢四分三厘半午市爲六錢四分三厘、較前日回跌一厘半、做出交易早市二十二萬五千、午市十四萬五千、銅元改長五百文、爲三百七十千○五百文、</p>

<p>昨日洋欵出口甚巨、聞重慶市上、因銀行爲收吸準備金起見、抬價吸現、以致現欵枯竭、紛電滬漢購裝現洋、但漢埠當然亦轉向滬購抵、故全部大批需要、全仗滬埠供給、連日陸續裝出者、已有百餘萬、昨則又復大批裝去、計有二百餘萬、然申釐旣漲至三分光景、則恐渝埠市面、不甚合算、或者中止亦未可知、不過現欵旣竭、則雖高價、亦須購備耳、聞滬埠方面、昨日除裝重慶外、尙有北路亦去四十餘萬云、</p>

<p>惟九六微跌成交共八百十餘萬</p>
<p>昨日公債期貨雖略遜前、賣買兩方人氣仍不寂寞、全日合計八百十七萬五千元、現貨續二五忽做開二萬元、餘均祗數千元、合計三萬三千二百元、至各債價之變動情形、因市上人心良好、各方投資買進仍較賣出爲旺、故價仍趨漲勢、較前日計各漲一二角至五六角不等、獨九六比前日略形回疲、</p>

<p>— 黄雋</p>
<p>第五屆展覽會將開幕</p>
<p>在鳥聲碎亂的春光中、天空是碧藍無際、大野的花草也在怒放了、遠望粉綠的叢林、夾着幾點照眼的紅花、儇貼在如黛的春山脚下、幾處人家、幾聲犬吠、我這時步來江灣路上仿佛春釀的醇酒酩酊了、天氣是和煦異常、間或有一陣春風飄摇地在靑翠的樹枝上愛撫、在四處望不到一點淸白的天空的屋子裏面、把我像一座古刹中的修士一般禁锢了幾個月了、這次我居然領略到一點大自然的風味、雖然足踽𨂙地獨步、但我胸襟無限的欣悅、當不下於翱翔蒼天的雲雀呵、當我走到花園街的時候、週遭全爲樹枝所翳、驟然一陣蔭凉之氣、通過我身體的全部、春的永畫的靜寂美、使我的脚步更加收得輕輕的、不敢發出造次的脚音、把守護這裏的春神的午睡驚醒了、除了我悠閑的從這裏走過外、地下只有低低的幾隻燕子掠飛、</p>
<p>我望見一座富有西洋古代風味的建築、在環抱萬綠的當中突出來、我知道這</p>
<p>是晨光藝術會、</p>
<p>於是我的散步也在這裏作暫時的投止、</p>
<p>剥啄地敲着他們雖没有關的門、侍者便刹時引導我到了他們的屋裏、是在臨街的樓上、有挹覽朝陽與晚霞之勝、而無車馬聲喧、這眞是作畫的勝地呵、</p>
<p>這時王先生正在畫架之前、舉起稜稜有神的目光向我望了一下、便這樣打着招呼、</p>
<p>「呵、長遠不見、……」</p>
<p>「王先生眞忙哩、」</p>
<p>我發現壁的角落裏堆滿了油畫、他們手中的彩筆還依然是顯得狠忽忙的、三四個人不停留的繪畫着、</p>
<p>「因爲我們預定展覽會的日期！四月二十五日！離現在很近、」</p>
<p>「我想大半部都完成了吧、」</p>
<p>那些都是畫好了的、現在還有幾幅尙未完工、」</p>
<p>「先生、這次的展覽會我想一定更能給大家滿足的、」</p>
<p>「未必罷、」他仍然在調色板上、調和着顔色臉上却泛着不穩定的笑容、</p>
<p>「這是第幾屆、」</p>
<p>「第五屆、」</p>
<p>「呵、歷史很長了、」</p>
<p>「我們第一次的展覽會、說起來是在民國九年罷、」</p>
<p>「因了時期的悠久、你們的出品、恐怕現在一定繪得很多吧、」</p>
<p>我於是走到堆疊畫板的地方隨意翻着、</p>
<p>「這裏有没有别種題材、」</p>
<p>「有的、我們的出品不懂是革命的史實、還有許許多中國古代的傳說、以及目前民旗苦難的描寫、」</p>
<p>「這些我覺得都是我們很重要的、」</p>
<p>室内安放了幾只畫架、各人正在向着畫的部位取各種不同的角度看、王先生便以全副精力貫注到畫上、在停筆的一頃聞、有時搔着頭髮作凄苦的焦思、有時現出一縷温和的笑、我於此看見創造的艱絶了、但是這許多堆疊在四壁的作品、却不知要費盡他們多少時日與精力呵、這時我更覺到藝人的偉大、給我們創造了一個神化的美的世界、</p>
<p>不敢再以喋喋的談話妨碍了他們的工作、只是在那許多作品裏面顧自獨着、可是胸臆間的情調便隨和着不同的調子轉變了、</p>
<p>我看見題名「赤色的恐怖一的作品、給我一個很大的震驚、上面是一個靑色面獠牙的人、手中持着尖刃從烈燄中跳出來、這人很像一個神話裏面傳說的惡魔、其次便是「長沙的印象」、幾乎唤回了我在故鄕中一夕數驚的恐怖了、地下躺着無數的裸體的男女、依希還在流着鮮血、幕着昏黄天光的黑烟疾風捲着紅色的火舌奔來、那在慘殺之下的民衆、掙扎呻吟之聲猶凄然可辯、於是我立刻退到我原來的坐位之上、呼吸異樣的迫促、如同爲噩夢所魔、然而他們都仍然在那裏繼續工作着、略爲休息幾十分鐘吧、我才漸漸的從瞀亂的思潮中淸醒點、於是我重新又翻着看、在那疊作品裏面、那題作「創造」中四處用暗淡的調子、陪出逐漸光明的山頂來、以我的意思去猜度、那伸着臂膀來的人、或許是因爲在黑夜的酣睡中、天際突然閃下一條電火、如同畫上那種奪目的光、把山林震開了、把這酣睡的人驚醒了、於是在躍起的一頃間、太陽吐着萬道金蛇在高挿雲表的山　裏、重新給與這世界的光與熱、我這時也好像那張臂向天高呼的人一般、</p>
<p>其他許多有力的、生動的好作品、都一一跳進我的眼簾、還有幾張題名「童女斬蛇」、「女媧氏」「后羿射日」、通通是古代傳說的描寫、我刹時便以驚訝的聲音打破靜寂、王先生因爲我的好奇心所動、即刻放下畫筆來、轉將每一張的含義爲我解釋、我站在他旁邊埀聽、好像兒時聽大人同我講故事一般的有趣、</p>
<p>王先生看到我幼穉的笑、他也笑了、</p>
<p>太陽最後的光綫射進了窗檻、我的視綫又轉移到描寫戰爭的作品上、看那革命的戰士横渡黄河、看那成千累萬的民衆聚集那兒開民衆大會、還有戰地上的瞭望、都使我感到熱煕的瘋狂的情緒、於是我在瞬息的萬變的狀况之下、好像是飽飫盛宴一般、在以前雖然看過幾處美術展覽會的我、但是所給我的印象全如淡烟似的老早消逝了、且無一張能夠使我徘徊留戀的、於藝術於賞鑑、我雖無足稱道、可是我在今天所得的印象、是永遠不會忘記的、我便對王先生這樣的表示謝意、</p>
<p>「我今天、是第一次第到有生命光圈所籠罩的作品啊、」</p>
<p>「不、我們還覺得這些微的收獲有所不足、」</p>
<p>「好說…好說…」</p>
<p>當我燃着一枝烟捲後看看外面將近的暮色、大家都停住了筆、怱怱的準備回去了、</p>
<p>於是我和王先生一握手、便怱怱的走出晨光藝術會、心裏到在這時還是憧憬着、</p>
<p>呵、藝人是至高無上的造物主、</p>

<p>— 安平</p>
<p>九　我的祖母</p>
<p>車一過濟南、天漸黑了、那晚我很早的就睡了、因爲明天一早要在天津換車上北平、那晚睡得很好、不過、不知怎麽樣、我彷彿看見了我的祖母、不消說、那自然祗是一個夢、我得承認、那晚我的確夢到了我祖母、雖然我不再記得那夢裏的瑣碎、我得說、我的祖母是世上愛我的一些人之中的最愛我的一個、是世上一些有恩於我的人之中的最有恩於我的一個、從母胎裏生出來了六天就死去了母親的我、全得有祖母的撫育、我所給予我祖母的精神上的安慰與怡娱是另件事、我祖母的撫育我、愛我、而且敎養我、至少我得承認、没有她、不會有現在這樣還看得過去的一個我、她什麽地方什麽事總忘不了她的小孫孫、有糖得先給安平吃、有好看的衣料得先給安平剪一件、上那兒玩、得帶安平去、在我所有的記憶裏、她没打過我五次、一個大人不打一個小孩、自然說不上這就是愛、然而她捨不得打我、她是愛我、却又不能說她溺愛我、箸頭上出逆子、捧頭上出孝子、她也說、她的敎管我、頂利害的手段不是打、是臉的「顔色」、由她平時怎樣愛我、要是她一擺出一種瘭嚴來、誰也怕、她總說安平這孩子命苦、說了、又看看我白白的臉、我小時曉得什麽、</p>
<p>我從没離開我祖母過一直到第一次上南京去讀書的一年、祖母的愛、在那時、才使我理會到了、</p>
<p>天下的事常這樣、要等到你知道這是快樂的時候、你那時已經不快樂了、誰不覺得童年可愛、但是又有誰在童年時就覺得童年可愛的、一樣、我說那時我才眞的理會到了祖母的愛、但就在那年起、我不再能得到祖母的愛、祖母就在那年的五月裏、死了、死了、</p>
<p>我眞不願再去想到這些事、因爲想到這些事、會使我難過的、我小時所僅依賴的是我祖母、我祖母所僅得到怡娱的也是我、爲了小孫的學業、她很高興的帮他料理鋪蓋行李、但是、在祖母死後、家人們在追念時候談一些什麽、說我到南京去了之後、我祖母的生活便起了一種很黝暗的變化、她的生活裏彷彿失掉了一個活跳的太陽似的、常常變爲很陰沉、很憂鬱的了、每次、接到我從南京學校裏寄來的書信、總歡喜得什麽似的、呌人吟給她聽、一遍、兩遍、三遍、因爲祖母病重、我從南京趕回來、家裏的人也歡喜、說她最愛的孫子趕回來了、也許會使她精神上好一些的、我一跑到了家、便將頭伏在她懷裏、天啊、我那時曉得什麽呢、她不再有氣力說一句話、我也懂不得應該找出怎樣一句頂適當的話來安慰安慰她、我祇像一隻小山羊地伏地床邊上將光光的小臉給她摸摸、她閉着眼睛、定着神、像撫摸着一件稀世寳貴一樣、也偶而掀起眼皮來看一看我、看看我是瘦、還是胖、</p>
<p>上帝不再爲她的小孫孫的不幸、多留住她一年或者半年、就在那年的五月裏她死了、</p>
<p>我的祖母死了以後、我便不曾再有一個人來愛我、像我祖母的愛我一樣、我祖母死了、埀十年了、我常常紀念着她、但却難得夢到她、難得在一兩年之中夢到她一次、但要是眞的夢到了她、又彷彿這個夢多少有一些意義一樣、</p>
<p>頂愛我的是我的祖母、我祖母頂愛的人、也便是我、就是她死了、她的靈魂還是常常週巡遊在我的遭的、每每遇到有一些很不平常的事來了、我便會得夢見她、那一次在車中、我又夢見了我祖母、夢後醒來、怪紀念她、也怪感激她、假若靈魂這樣東西是有的話、我相信她的靈魂是常常在我週遭巡護着的、</p>
<p>十　從天津到北平</p>
<p>五號天還没亮、茶房便將所有的客人們呌醒了、從浦口到北平的通車、在天津、本來用不着換車、可就是我上北平那一次的那幾天、說要換、茶房將許多客人們呌醒、呌得這早、也無非是好讓大家將隨身小物件弄舒齊了、乘出時間來、讓他們好收一些「小帳」而已、</p>
<p>天津一共有三個站、一個呌老站、一個呌總站、還有一個呌什麽站忘了、我不知是在那一個站下來來的、到天津時天剛亮、遠處的電燈、像天邊的繁星似的閃燦着、人在車子裏、眞不覺得冷、一下車、單那風、便夠使人受了、</p>
<p>在候車室裏坐了一回、說上北平的車來了、於是又跑了出來、因爲自己路不熟、呌一個脚夫代我提皮包、與其說是提東西、還不如說是呌他引引路好、從那輛車到這輛車、眞祇幾步路、他說有規矩、要我四毛錢、我想北地人都老實、反正自已初上北邊來、不在乎、給了他、但到上了上北平的車、看見人家有六七件大東醵、都没給兩毛錢、這才知道上了當、</p>
<p>假若我上北平、祗住三五天就打回的話、那北平、單氣候、便會給我一個很不好的印象了、北地别的不担心、就担心刮風、要刮風、便什麽都没辦法、剛剛從氣候像江南四五月裏的氣候的車箱裏走出、那吃得消、北邊人大都帶着可以翻下邊來的皮帽子、又披着領子很高很闊的皮大衣、其用處、就全在這、比如說上海、皮大衣的領、有那末兩寸闊、得了、北邊、北邊得倍一倍、我那天眞吃足了苦、候車時、彷彿四面都有風、直向你頸子裏鑽、耳子從軟的漸漸地變成硬的、鼻子也一樣、而且鼻涕也像泉水一般地緩緩地流出來了、</p>
<p>平津路上的二等車、簡直和三等没大分别、一樣的舊破、不整齊、從天津上北平、得費上三個鐘頭、北國的鄕野、老是那麽一列的單調、記得我從北平回到江南來時、一踏上了京滬綫、沿途便是綠綠的草、碧靑的水、可愛、在北地、不要說在火車上、就是無論在什麽野外、怕也尋不到一片如像江南一樣明媚的風光、是一望無際、幾千畝的黄土、看不出那裏是天地交接的地方、要或者、那就是遠遠一些樹影、一排灰黑、常常半空裏、騰起一條白氣、截斷在樹影的中腰、這白氣、你會得猜、是雲、是霧、然而我得說、是沙土</p>
<p>北地的灰沙眞利害、來勁的時候、你閉着眼、便覺得有一粒粒小沙子向你臉上撒過來、北地不像江南一樣常常有雨、土地是一年到頭那樣的乾鬆、所以一遇風、便飛起來了、</p>
<p>車到北平約上午十一點多鐘、下了車、我走東不識西地跟着别人湧出了月台、想先找個旅館、没有離開上海時、有人說花園飯店和中央飯店好、花園飯店祗就是稍爲遠些、中央飯店、要是没有洗浴問、有三塊多錢一間也興了、我想决計找中央、可是到頭始終没有碰見中央的招待、祇糊裏糊塗地跟了東方飯店的招待上東方去、</p>
<p>東方飯店的招待、是將我裝在一輛汽車裏從車站送到旅館的、北邊的人、雖有名的老實、但爲仔細、我院問、</p>
<p>「這車是不是你們旅館裏專門備了接送客人的、」</p>
<p>他說對、我想上海有些旅館、自己都另外有汽車接送客人的、我又問、</p>
<p>「那末車費是不用客人負擔的咯、」</p>
<p>他又說對、他說這車費由他們旅館的帳房間裏算、我想問到這樣、總不會出什麽亂子了、於是便坐了上去、</p>
<p>從車站到東方、雇黄包車、大概一隻角子都不消、以這樣一短短的路程、汽車不消三四分鐘便到了、生意人總愛開大口、侍者將我一引引進一間十二塊錢一天的大房間裏、我好笑、說自己又不是當什麽委員來此接任的、住這好房間、</p>
<p>到頭住了三塊錢一天的、房子可不算壞、有水汀、可是我坐還没坐定、樓下便送上來了一張簽字單、說要我簽個字、我一看、是剛才的汽車費、大泮一塊四角、意思是我簽了字、不用得現在付、將來在算房錢時一起算便了、我知道上了當、於是祇得呌了剛才從車站接我來的招待員上來問、他也自知理屈、祇用一些牛頭不對馬口的話在我面前討饒、北平的侍者、生就練成那麽一付小心謹愼的臉和謙和的態度、我想算了、反正車倒底是我自己坐的、付了吧、</p>
<p>但因爲怕他們再敲竹槓、害得我以後即使呌一碗麵、都得先問一問什麽價錢了、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Spain Declares Republic <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Spain has now declared a republic and abolished the throne. The world has lost another monarchy. In recent years, countries that despise parliamentary politics have often tended towards extremes on both the left and right. Consequently, those with insight have seen this as endangering the future of democracy. However, the vast majority of people are indeed trending towards the current of democracy. Since Italy's Fascist Party implemented a dictatorship in Europe, Spain was the first to follow suit. Since declaring a constitutional monarchy in 1876, Spain had seen successive cabinet changes and frequent coups. Rivera then rose up and implemented a dictatorial regime, regarding Italy's dictatorship as a panacea for saving the times. At the time, it was not without some small effect. However, before long, the people suffered the constraints of autocracy and the deprivation of freedom, and uprisings to overthrow the cabinet occurred one after another. Rivera exhausted all means, hoping to suppress the people's resistance. But the more he suppressed, the more forceful the people's resistance became. The tide of revolution spread throughout the country, eventually becoming unsustainable and collapsing. At this time, the Spanish King was still not aware, and appointed General Berenguer as Prime Minister. Although Berenguer used political reform as a slogan, he actually continued Rivera's dictatorial policies. He also retreated because he could not maintain the situation. His successor, Asnar, saw that the situation was already critical and eagerly wanted to avoid the name of dictator. He thought of rushing to hold re-elections and amending the constitution to alleviate the hearts of the people throughout the country and preserve the situation of the monarchical government. However, at this time, the hearts of the people had all unanimously trended towards republicanism. Not only could the dictatorial system not be maintained, but the monarchical system was also in an extremely difficult situation to maintain. He wanted to support it, but there was nothing to support it with. This is why the Spanish King had no choice but to abdicate today. Although it is not yet known whether this reorganization of Spain into a republic will be permanent, this dictatorial system, after a long period of testing, will certainly not be revived. For democratic politics has now become an irresistible trend. Even if it is temporarily swayed by a portion of dictatorial forces, the hearts of the people will ultimately adapt to this major trend. Therefore, even if the future of the Spanish republic is inevitably still fraught with difficulties and obstacles, its eventual success is probably predictable.</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<p>Spain</p>
<p>Imperial System Overthrown</p>
<p>Republic Established</p>
<p>The Whole Country Celebrates as if Drunk</p>
<p>Abdicated King Alfonso Flees to England</p>
<p>Republican Leaders Form New Cabinet</p>
<p>On the 14th, a Nationalist News Agency telegram from Madrid stated that the King of Spain, seeing that the whole country was leaning towards republicanism and that the trend of the times was irresistible, decisively abdicated the throne and left the country. This news spread throughout the city early this morning, but it could not be confirmed. It was not until around 6:00 PM that Foreign Minister Lomananas personally visited the Republican leader Zamora and informed him that the King had abdicated and officially handed over the national seal and power to Zamora. Shortly afterward, Zamora summoned domestic and foreign journalists to formally announce that Alfonso had abdicated and that the royal family had gone to Paris. Thus, the Spanish republican system was formally proclaimed, and the new cabinet was also announced. The cabinet includes Prime Minister Zamora, Finance Minister Barrio, Foreign Minister Leros, Army Minister Ayala, Navy Minister Quiroga, Interior Minister Maura, Justice Minister Rios, Public Works Minister Duezquez, Labor Minister Caballero, Transportation Minister Palacios, and National Government Secretary Galarza. Once the news of the King's abdication spread, the whole country went wild. People in Madrid and other places were shouting and celebrating in the streets. Workers and students took to the streets in demonstrations, holding either the red flag of the Socialist Party or the red, yellow, and purple flag of the Republican Party. After various places simultaneously announced the establishment of the republican system, all public buildings, barracks, fortresses, etc. uniformly changed to the new flag. The people cheered and celebrated like a mountain and a sea. A riot even broke out in the city of Barcelona, ​​the reason for which is not yet clear. It is probably caused by a conflict between the centralist faction of the Spanish Republican Party and the Catalan Republican autonomous faction, while Madrid itself is still in a state of intoxication and frenzy. Residents are throwing out portraits of the King, royal family, and all signs of the autocratic era from the windows to celebrate with a fire in public places. The new cabinet includes the Conservative Party, Catholic Republican Party, and Socialist Party, with a diversity of parties. Some say that it is a transitional cabinet, and after the election of the National Assembly and the formulation of the constitution in the future, there will be a new atmosphere. The 14th Nationalist News Agency telegram from Madrid stated that the provisional government announced the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic at the City Hall late tonight. The first republican system existed for only one year from 1873 to 1874. After the establishment of the republican government, the first order was to pardon all political prisoners, the second order was to notify the whole country to maintain peace, and the third order was to summon all ambassadors and ministers appointed by the deposed King. It has also announced April 15th as National Day.</p>
<p>The 14th Nationalist News Agency telegram from Madrid stated that the abdication letter of Spanish King Alfonso will be announced by Zamora tomorrow morning. The letter briefly states that since the people's opinion is such, if I go against it, the responsibility for the future will be too heavy, and I have always prioritized the welfare of the country. Now that my long occupation of the throne is incompatible with the trend of modern times, I have no choice but to withdraw cleanly. In addition to expressing his abdication, the letter also abolishes all relationships between his descendants and the Spanish throne. The 14th Nationalist News Agency telegram from Madrid stated that Spanish King Alfonso left the capital in the dead of night for Cartagena, where he took a warship to England. The conditions for Alfonso's abdication are reportedly (1) he should be given considerable courtesy when leaving the country, (2) all property and supplies should be given convenience for preservation, and (3) he should be given the highest honor in the army when leaving the country. After the Spanish King went to Cartagena, the royal family took a special train to Paris. The Republicans did not arrest or detain them.</p>
<p>The 15th Nationalist News Agency telegram from Madrid stated that the world's newest capital is still in a frenzy today. From Tuesday to Wednesday morning, the streets were full of celebrants who had not slept all night. The people and the military police, who had previously stood clearly opposed to each other, are now like brothers, congratulating each other. Furthermore, when the family members of the deposed King Alfonso left the country by special train, representatives of the new government accompanied them to avoid accidents along the way.</p>
<p>The 15th Nationalist News Agency telegram from Paris stated that a major event has occurred along the French-Spanish border, especially in the Hendaye area, namely, the return of Spanish revolutionaries and exiles, who are being warmly welcomed by the people. The revolutionaries have a fervent expression, prostrating themselves and kissing the soil once they step on Spanish territory. As for French public opinion on the reform of the Spanish political system, it generally expresses welcome, while at the same time stating that Spanish King Alfonso has always had sincere feelings towards the French.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 15th: Alfonso, accompanied by the Duke of Miranda, arrived in Cartagena at 4 a.m. this morning and immediately boarded the Spanish cruiser Alfonso, departing before dawn. It is generally believed that his destination is England. Trains entering and leaving the border are extremely crowded, with nobles leaving and exiles returning. The new Finance Minister, Berito, returning from Paris, told a Reuters reporter that he expected the future of the currency value to be more stable. The transfer of power in Madrid went through the old Senate and House of Representatives, and then the Republican flag was hoisted high to inform the people. The masses cheered wildly. Dr. Zamora immediately broadcast a radio message, advising the people to maintain dignity and public order, and promising local freedom. A few military officers opposed the Republican system. Former Army Minister Birimeng refused to hand over the seal of office, and the new government will arrest him. Sixteen of the new cabinet members were prisoners a few days ago for the coup last December.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th: Observing the sympathetic tone of the London newspapers, if the deposed King of Spain is willing to come to England, he will be welcomed. Several newspapers suggest that Craigweil House be the deposed King's residence. Alfonso is the son of Alfonso XII and married Victoria, a British royal princess. Craigweil House is in Bognor, where King George of England was treated for his illness a few years ago.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 15th: When Alfonso left the palace, he said to his close servants, "My departure brings peace," but the deposed King was already speechless at this time and could not finish his words. Five cars were waiting outside the door, each carrying eight armed soldiers. After the deposed King said goodbye to the Queen and others, he left the inner room, and the halberdiers saluted him, saying "Long live the King!" The deposed King seemed unmoved, only replying "Long live Spain!" Many bystanders shed tears, and the deposed King calmed them down. Then he sat alone in a car, and soon the wheels turned and headed towards Cartagena on the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 15th: The Queen has led her daughters to Irun, which is in northeastern Spain, not far from the French border. When the deposed King was about to leave, he left a letter, instructing it to be published after he left the country.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 15th: Dr. Zamora, the leader of the new Spanish government, has served as a cabinet minister twice. Zamora is the only former cabinet minister of the old dynasty who abandoned the monarchy and joined the Republican Party. Zamora was the mastermind behind the coup in December last year. Although he was imprisoned for six months, he still directed party affairs from prison. Zamora is one of Spain's great orators and one of the most knowledgeable about military affairs, especially the Moroccan problem.</p>
<p>Reuters, Barcelona, 15th: Serious disturbances occurred last night, reminiscent of the French Revolution. The authorities immediately declared martial law. Thousands of people surrounded the prison, demanding the release of political prisoners, unaware that the order to release political prisoners had already been issued. The crowd planned to destroy the prison, and in order to avoid bloodshed, the authorities released all the prisoners together, so that criminal prisoners were also released. The same thing happened in the women's prison. Fingerprints were destroyed by the crowd. Later, there was street fighting, the reason for which is unknown. It is reported that several people died. The National Federation of Trade Unions announced a 24-hour strike to prevent a monarchist reaction. Armed villagers are now holding all cars in the territory, only allowing 共扣党 [likely 共產黨] to pass through. Masia, the provisional president of the Catalan Republic, issued a notice, stating that he is temporarily taking office under President Zamora, and that the Catalan Republic will be an integral part of the Spanish federation.</p>

<p>Army Inspector General Resigns</p>
<p>A Nationalist News Agency telegram from Lisbon on the 14th stated that the news of Spain's declaration of a republic has been especially encouraging to the rebel party, which is quite willing to make persistent efforts. Army Inspector General General Perez has resigned, and former Army Chief of Staff Barreto has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the anti-riot army.</p>
<p>Wakatsuki Cabinet Resolves</p>
<p>to Implement the Policies of the Previous Cabinet</p>
<p>All Political Appointees Changed</p>
<p>Opposition Party Proceeds with Cabinet Overthrow Again</p>
<p>The Toko News Agency telegram from Tokyo on the 15th stated that Prime Minister Wakatsuki issued a statement after the cabinet meeting last night regarding the formation of this cabinet, saying, "I am very grateful for receiving this grace. The policy direction of the current cabinet is no different from the general direction of the Hamaguchi cabinet. However, we must adapt to the progress of the times and make appropriate facilities. I am determined to follow this purpose and make the best efforts with all cabinet members."</p>
<p>The Toko News Agency telegram from Tokyo on the 15th stated that the first cabinet meeting of the new cabinet was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 6:00 PM last night. Wakatsuki reported on the process from receiving the great mandate to forming the cabinet, and then discussed the future policy direction. As a result, it was decided to generally follow the policies of the Hamaguchi cabinet, and in order to thoroughly implement them throughout the country, a conference of local officials will be convened for four days starting from the 27th, and a conference of judicial officials will be convened for four days starting from the 6th of next month.</p>
<p>The Japan Union News Agency telegram from Tokyo on the 15th stated that a temporary cabinet meeting was held at 1:00 PM today to discuss the establishment of a preparatory committee for the three major organization and investigation meetings on administration, finance, and taxation, which were decided by the previous cabinet, and their implementation direction. As a result, it was resolved to implement all matters decided by the previous cabinet, and it was also decided to change all political appointees in each province except for the Ministry of the Army, in order to absorb the air of new parties inside and outside the cabinet. The Toko News Agency telegram from Tokyo on the 15th stated that the Seiyukai, which had lost its political power, believed that the emergence of the extension cabinet was to change the party leader to make up for the policy flaws of the Minseito and deceive the people. The so-called maintaining political power with deceptive policies is an act of rebellion against constitutional government. It has decided to abandon its previous attitude of watching quietly and carry out an active cabinet overthrow movement. It will soon hold a cabinet overthrow speech rally in ten major cities and establish new policies.</p>
<p>Icelandic Parliament Orders Dissolution</p>
<p>The Nationalist News Agency telegram from Reykjavik, Iceland on the 14th stated that the King of Denmark and Iceland ordered the dissolution of the Icelandic Parliament in Copenhagen today. After issuing this order, the Prime Minister of Iceland declared that general elections will be held on June 12th. The Icelandic Parliament was dissolved by the King of Denmark because it proposed a motion to impeach the government.</p>
<p>US Embassy in Germany Destroyed by Fire</p>
<p>The Nationalist News Agency telegram from Berlin on the 15th stated that the US Embassy in Germany was completely destroyed by fire today. Because it had only recently moved in, no important documents were lost.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>The following telegram from Xi'an is addressed to all newspaper offices: Shaanxi Province has suffered three years of drought and famine, and the number of deaths is countless. The disaster is unprecedented. We are grateful that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved to issue public bonds of 8 million yuan to help relieve the victims. Everyone is celebrating and hoping for a new life. However, several months have passed, and this has not been realized. We anxiously await a telegram and are even more eager for rescue. After repeated appeals from various parties, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek fortunately approved the issuance of 500,000 yuan. Although this can temporarily relieve the urgent needs, it is ultimately a drop in the bucket. Recently, we received a telegram from Hao Mengjiu, the representative of our province's relief association stationed in Nanjing, stating that there is a rumor that the remaining 300,000 yuan of the above-mentioned allocation will be reallocated to the four provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia. Upon hearing this, we were shocked and horrified. Because this is the time when the disaster is becoming more and more serious, and if relief is not provided urgently, there will be no chance of survival for the remaining people in Shaanxi. In addition to directly telegramming Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ordering the full amount to be issued as originally planned to maintain credibility, we humbly appeal in this telegram, hoping that you will have compassion for the extreme disaster in Shaanxi and quickly send a telegram to the central government, asking them to quickly investigate and clarify. If there is an agreement on the above-mentioned reallocation, please cancel it immediately and complete the relief effort to the end. We will be grateful for your kindness forever. We eagerly await your reply. Yang Hucheng, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, signed with winter seal.</p>

<p>Supervising the Suppression of He Long's Remnants and Other Red Bandits</p>
<p>Military Affairs in Western Hubei Are All Under the Command of Xu</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Yuanquan, the commissioner for bandit suppression and rural pacification in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei, previously came to Hankou from Shashi to pay respects to He Chengjun, the head of the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters. He reported on the progress of bandit suppression in western Hubei and requested instructions. The headquarters, noting Xu's arrival in Hankou, intended to convene a conference in Wuhan with various generals stationed in Hubei to discuss the pacification of the province. However, Xu believed that He Long's remnant bandits were causing disturbances in Badong, Zigui, and Xingshan counties, and for the sake of thorough annihilation, it was inconvenient for him to stay in Hankou for long. Therefore, the conference did not take place. On the morning of the 14th at 8:00 AM, he returned to Shashi by civilian airline to resume his duties. His staff traveled west on the Wugua merchant ship. After arriving in Shashi, Xu immediately supervised his troops and launched an offensive against the bandit strongholds in Xingshan. He also joined forces with Zhang Ying, Jue, Wang Lingji, and Guo Xun's divisions to encircle and suppress the bandits. The bandit disasters in various counties of western Hubei were severe. Xu consulted with the Civil Affairs Department and the Relief Committee of the provincial government to distribute emergency relief. In the future, Xu will assess the severity of the situation in each area and allocate aid accordingly. As for the local government affairs in each county, the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters and the provincial government have decided that Xu will be responsible for command and control during the bandit suppression period. Those who fail to carry out orders effectively will be subject to military law. The provincial government has already issued an order to the magistrates of Mianyang, Jianli, Gong'an, Shishou, Jiangling, Jingmen, and Qianjiang counties to strictly comply. (October 14th)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: The election of representatives to the National Assembly in Hankou continued on the 14th, still divided into fourteen districts and over twenty polling places. The voting groups, in addition to the district farmers' associations (districts one through six), Ruikang Silk Factory Labor Union, Jiji Electric Plant, Glass Industry Labor Union, Dyeing Industry Labor Union, and the Tenth District Wharf Association, which had already completed their voting on the first day, all continued to vote. Furthermore, groups such as the Water Plant Labor Union, Fuxin Factory, and Huai Salt Industry Labor Union, which were scheduled to vote on this day, also participated. The total number of voting citizens was still over 20,000, with larger turnouts in the sixth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth polling districts. Thanks to the effective maintenance of order by the military and police, the guidance of the instructors, and the supervision of supervisors Liu Wendao and Yang Zaichun, order was strictly maintained in all polling places. Only in the sixth polling place (Xinshi Market) was there another incident of someone being forced to write ballots for others.

<h3 id="e4">Hunan Province Discovers Case of Illicit Special Tax Collection <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Related Officials Have Been Removed from Their Posts and Are Under Investigation</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: A major case has recently been discovered in Hunan, involving Guo Tao, the deputy division commander of the 15th Division and concurrently the commander of the Hunan provincial capital's garrison; Wang Hanchuan, the director of the provincial capital's Public Security Bureau; Wang Zhengshi, the magistrate of Changsha County; and Yang Dihua, the captain of the Water Police Corps. These four individuals are accused of unauthorized extra taxation (i.e., opium tax) and dividing the tax money among themselves, amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Special goods entering Hunan from Guizhou are subject to a special tax of 400 yuan per shi, which is collected by the Lianghu Special Tax Clearing Office established by the Ministry of Finance in Baoqing. The collected tax revenue is split, with half going to the central government and half to the Fourth Route Army's military expenses. Monthly tax revenue ranges from over one million yuan to at least 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, making it a major source of income for the province. According to established practice, after paying taxes and affixing stamps in Baoqing, goods can circulate throughout Hunan without being subject to further taxation. However, Guo Tao, Wang Hanchuan, Wang Zhengshi, and Yang Dihua, seeing the potential for profit, colluded to engage in malpractice. They privately collected 20 yuan per shi (some say 40 yuan) on special goods transported to Hankou via Changsha, dividing the money among themselves. This practice has been going on for over half a year without being discovered. The amount of illegally collected tax money totals hundreds of thousands of yuan. Recently, He Jian transferred Cao Sui's 4th Regiment of the 31st Division to garrison Changsha. After Cao's regimental commander discovered the situation, he secretly reported it to Division Commander Tao Guang, who in turn reported everything to He Jian. He Jian dispatched personnel to investigate, and after confirming the facts, he was enraged. In his capacity as the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army, he first removed Guo Tao from his post and placed him under investigation. He also appointed Hu Da as the commander of the provincial capital's garrison and concurrently in charge of the Changsha Fortress. Furthermore, since Wang Hanchuan, Wang Zhengshi, and Yang Dihua were civil officials, he specially requested the provincial government to severely punish them and recover the illegally collected tax money. After the case was discovered, it attracted a great deal of attention in Hunan. The following is a transcript of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters' official letter to the Hunan Provincial Government: "Regarding the matter of requesting instructions, the clearing of special taxes was originally intended to support military needs. The central government established an office to handle this, which was done out of necessity. Our department was ordered to assist and has long issued orders to all agencies prohibiting exceptional taxation that would hinder tax collection. All officials should understand this purpose and strive to assist in order to increase tax revenue and maintain military morale. However, we previously received a report from Division Commander Tao Guang of the 31st Division, based on a report from Regimental Commander Cao Sui, stating that the garrison command was collecting exceptional taxes on special goods passing through the provincial capital. We were greatly surprised and ordered Commander Guo Tao to submit a clear report on the collection situation. Now, Commander Guo's report states that it was purely at the repeated request of merchants and that it was not extortion by his department, the Changsha County Government, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, or the Water Police Corps. He has submitted a statement of income and expenses, totaling 2,874.40 yuan, requesting review and instructions, along with an attached list of income and expenses. In light of this, and having reviewed the report and attachments, we find that a clear order has been issued to unify the collection of special taxes, and no agency is permitted to arbitrarily impose additional levies. Even in special circumstances, the matter should be reported to the headquarters for approval before proceeding. However, the commander did not report in advance and instead, at the request of merchants, divided the tax money with the Changsha County Public Security Bureau and the Water Police Corps. This is illegal and inexcusable and should be punished to maintain official integrity. In addition to the order already issued to remove him from his post and place him under investigation, the Director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, Wang Hanchuan, the Magistrate of Changsha County, Wang Zhengshi, and the Captain of the Water Police Corps, Yang Dihua, should also be reported to the Hunan Provincial Government for separate punishment. All collected tax money should be handed over to the headquarters, and the submitted expenses will not be approved. You are hereby notified of this order. The attachments are kept on file and distributed. You are requested to investigate and punish the Director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, Wang Hanchuan, the Magistrate of Changsha County, Wang Zhengshi, and the Captain of the Water Police Corps, Yang Dihua, separately, and to order them to recover the tax money they received in full to maintain official integrity and prioritize tax collection. Your reply is requested. (December 12th)"</p>
<h3 id="e5">Liaoning Province National Assembly Elections Completed After Extension <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The schedule for the election of Liaoning and Ningxia representatives to the National Assembly was previously shortened by the Provincial Office, and all counties were ordered to submit their voter registration books by the end of March. Subsequently, because the counties failed to submit them on time, the deadline was extended to the 4th of this month. However, Antu, Kangping, Tao'an, and Changbai counties still failed to submit their books by the deadline. The Provincial Office, due to the pressing deadline and the impossibility of waiting any longer, and because the large number of registration books required time for review, decided to slightly change the election schedule. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to the supervisors of each county to inform them. The original telegram stated: "(To be reviewed by the election supervisors of each county: Regarding the matter of shortening the election schedule as decided by this office, a telegram has already been sent ordering compliance. Subsequently, because the registration books to be compiled by each county were not submitted by the end of last month, this office, for the sake of exercising caution in the election, sent another telegram extending the deadline for submission to the 4th of this month. However, the reorganization of various groups takes time, and counties in remote areas also face transportation difficulties, making it difficult to meet the deadline. As of today, Antu, Kangping, Tao'an, and Changbai counties have not yet submitted their books. The deadline is pressing, and it is impossible to wait any longer. Therefore, we have completed the review of the registration books that have been submitted over the past few days, working late into the night. The total number of registered voters in the entire province is over 470,000, making the printing of the master registration book a complex process that cannot be completed on schedule. It is necessary to slightly change the schedule again. The revised dates are listed below: (1) The general supervisor will review the qualifications, create the registration book, and issue a public announcement to the counties, to be completed by April 12th; (2) Voters will submit requests for correction of errors or omissions, and the election supervisors will announce the voting date, to be completed by April 14th; (3) Various groups will vote, and the election supervisors will prepare reports and submit them to the general supervisor, to be completed by April 21st; (4) The general supervisor will calculate the number of votes, determine the elected representatives, and notify the elected representatives, to be completed by April 23rd; (5) The elected representatives will respond to whether or not they wish to be elected, and the general supervisor will issue certificates and travel and expense allowances, to be completed by April 24th. The above revised dates are to be complied with after reporting and issuing a telegram. Do not delay. [Seal of Jia, General Supervisor of the Liaoning and Ningxia Elections], 1."</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: The bandits led by Sun Meisong in Baodugu, after Han Fuju arrived in Tengxian to supervise the siege, realized they could not escape. They then came up with a wild idea of joining forces with the bandits in Mengshan to flee southward. This was detected by the military, and Han telegraphed Wang Jun, commander of the 7th Division, to send troops to intercept them. Wang immediately dispatched Li Wenbin's brigade and Hu Yanzhi's regiment from north of Xuzhou, joining forces with Chen Chuanwen's regiment (originally stationed in Lincheng and Zaozhuang) to attack them from both sides. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, the Sun bandits fled back to their old nest in Baodugu. Han has ordered all the troops to begin a siege of Baodugu on the 13th. The bandits led by Wang Baichuan in Julinggu near Linqu will also be eliminated soon. The following are the telegrams from Han Fuju reporting the victories: (1) Notice: 1. Your brother [Han Fuju] arrived in Yanzhou on the 10th; 2. The 1st Regiment of the Pistol Brigade arrived in Qufu; the brigade's special service battalion and transportation, heavy artillery, and mortar platoons arrived in Yanzhou on the 10th and will go to Tengxian tomorrow morning (the 11th); 3. The Lunan Militia entered Sishui on the 10th; 4. The Mengshan bandits have been eliminated, and orders have been given to all units to lift the siege of Mengshan and advance on Baodugu; 5. According to a telegram from Division Commander Wang Zhiping (Wang Jun), Sun Meisong's bandits have fled into Yixian, secretly planning with bandits from Mengshan and Huxi to replicate the Lincheng incident by looting trains north of Hanzhuang and south of Guanqiao. Orders have been given to all units and the militias of all counties to strictly guard against Sun's bandits. Sincerely, Han Fuju [seal] on the 10th. (2) Notice: 1. According to a report from Division Commander Chen, the bandit leader Mao Xuetian has led his remnants to Qingshan. Orders have been given to Zhao's brigade to encircle and suppress them. Furthermore, the Lunan Militia stationed in Pingyi has been ordered to proceed to Shangye to block the bandits. 2. Regarding the bandits in Baodugu, orders have been given to all units to advance and encircle them on the 13th. The bandits are currently in a state of panic and are said to be fleeing to Huxi. 3. According to a report from Division Commander Qiao, after Chen's brigade tightly surrounded and attacked the bandits in Julinggu, the bandits fought among themselves over supplies and suffered many casualties from the artillery fire. They will be eliminated within a few days. Sincerely, Han Fuju [seal] on the 12th.</p>

<p>And Orders the Railway Protection Troops to Suppress Scattered Bandits</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Wang Jun, the commander of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Garrison, recently received a report from Chen Chuanwen, the regimental commander of the 70th Regiment of the 12th Division, which is participating in the siege of the Baodugu bandits on the Lincheng-Zaozhuang branch line, stating that the bandits may flee west and join forces with the bandits in Huxi. He dispatched Li Wenbin, the commander of the 21st Brigade, to lead Hu Yanzhi's 41st Regiment to Lincheng to intercept them. Now, Wang is going to Yanzhou this morning (the 13th) at 10:00 AM on the Taiping armored train to understand the true situation of the bandits in southern Shandong. Staff Officer Su Ziwen and Adjutant Jin Shuzhi are traveling with him. The 7th Platoon of the 3rd Battalion of the Railway Artillery Brigade stationed in Xuzhou is also departing with Wang. Wang plans to go to Lincheng first to meet with Li Wenbin, and then to Zaozhuang for inspection. The armored train that Wang previously requested to be transferred from Bian has already been led by Jiang Yin, the platoon commander of the 5th Platoon of the 2nd Battalion stationed in Bian, and passed through Xuzhou northward this morning, patrolling the Lincheng-Tengxian line for protection and cooperative suppression. It is also reported that the troops participating in the siege of the Baodugu bandits are very strong. Han Fuju, Ma Hongkui, and Chen Yaohan will also meet with Wang Jun in Yanzhou to discuss the joint suppression plan, in order to completely eliminate the bandit troubles in southern Shandong. Wang is expected to return to Xuzhou in three or four days. Yesterday, Wang Jun also issued an order to all railway protection troops to strictly patrol and engage in guerilla warfare to prevent scattered bandits from fleeing to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line. The Garrison Command has now issued the following announcement: "It is hereby announced that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is of utmost importance to transportation. This command is ordered to garrison it and must take strict precautions to maintain railway administration. Now that the troops stationed in various places are actively searching and suppressing the bandits, there is a deep concern that they may cause disturbances. It is specially ordered that all railway protection troops dispatch teams to patrol and engage in guerilla warfare within 50 li on both sides of the railway, closely cooperate with local security forces, and work together to search and suppress bandits in order to eliminate the bandits and prevent disturbances. Detectives should also be dispatched at any time to conduct thorough reconnaissance in nearby villages. If there are any reactionary elements or bandits hiding and causing trouble, the village chiefs and others must immediately report to the troops stationed in various places, who will be responsible for the suppression. Anyone who conceals information or colludes with the bandits will be arrested, verified, and punished according to law. This announcement is hereby issued for the general knowledge of all residents, who must cooperate with the troops stationed in various places to eliminate the bandits and ensure local peace. This is of utmost importance." (April 13th)</p>

<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Shanxi Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Chamber of Commerce, and others have jointly organized the Financial Reorganization Design Committee. The committee has held meetings for days to discuss ways to maintain the provincial currency. Yesterday, it submitted six proposed measures to the provincial government for adoption. The provincial government has approved them.

Approved. (2) After the military is reorganized and placed under the command of the deputy commander-in-chief, all military pay will naturally be received and distributed by the deputy commander-in-chief's headquarters. From now on, under no circumstances may military pay be withdrawn from the provincial bank. Approved. Military expenses will be raised through other means and will no longer be withdrawn from the provincial bank.

<p>Results of Representatives' Petition in Nanjing</p>
<p>The chambers of commerce of various counties in Jiangsu Province believed that the business tax regulations stipulated by the Jiangsu Department of Finance violated the guidelines set by the ministry. They held a meeting in Zhenjiang and elected representatives to petition in Nanjing. Subsequently, although the Ministry of Finance made some revisions to the Jiangsu Province business tax regulations, they still did not fully comply with the ministry's guidelines and had not been reviewed by the Central Political Conference. They held another meeting in Zhenjiang and decided to continue the petition and elected representatives to go to Nanjing for the second time to petition various ministries and departments. Yesterday (the 14th) at 8:30 AM, the representatives from the various county chambers of commerce, including Lu Huan, Yu Xiaochuan, Shen Zhiwan, Qian Sunqing, Cheng Ganqing, Ren Congfu, Li Shengbo, Wang Jingting, Lan Bohua, and Xu Zhuang, arrived in Nanjing. They first went to the Ministry of Industry, where they were received by Section Chief Zhang Yiqiu. The representatives stated the purpose of their petition, saying that the previous petition had received assistance from the ministry, but although the Ministry of Finance had made some revisions to the original regulations, many of them still did not fully comply with the guidelines. Now, the Ministry of Finance has submitted the revised regulations to the Central Political Conference and the Legislative Yuan for review. They cannot be implemented before they are approved, so they requested the ministry's assistance. Section Chief Zhang said that the Ministry of Finance's revision of the Jiangsu Province business tax regulations will be submitted to the Central Political Conference, and Minister Kong of their ministry is a member of the Central Political Conference and will forward the petition to Minister Kong and submit it to the meeting for review. Next, they went to the Ministry of Finance, where they were received by Section Chief Zhou Gangren of the Taxation Department. After the representatives stated their case, Section Chief Zhou said that the Ministry of Finance had submitted the revised regulations to the Legislative Yuan and the Central Political Conference for review and that he would sign the petition and forward it to the minister, who would then forward it to the Central Political Conference and the Legislative Yuan for consideration. Next, they went to the Executive Yuan, where they were received by Secretary Liu Yongkai. After the representatives stated their case, Secretary Liu promised to forward the petition to the Central Political Conference. Next, they went to the Legislative Yuan, where they were received by Secretary Tang Shiwei. In addition to stating the purpose of their petition, the representatives said that national legislation should be trustworthy and credible. If the implementing agencies arbitrarily interpret the articles and expand or contract them at will, it would be a great loss to the purpose of legislation. They requested the Legislative Yuan to specify the contents of this review in detail so that no implementing agency could freely expand or contract them, in order to uphold the spirit of legislation, which would be fortunate for the merchants. Secretary Tang said that he would forward their opinions to the president and adopt them during the review. The representatives then took their leave.</p>

<p>Tai Bao Ashu's Confession</p>
<p>The Pacification Office's Reply Approves Execution in Zhangyan</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Pacification Superintendent's Office recently received a telegram from Cao Pang, Commander of the Songhu Pacification Sub-district, stating that Tai Bao Ashu (also known as Xu Tianxiong), the ringleader of the Taihu Pudong gang of bandits captured in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, along with Xu Fusheng, are currently detained in the Minhang Water Police District. Due to repeated requests from the public and organizations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for their swift execution to appease public anger, and considering the mountain of accumulated cases and unpardonable crimes committed by the bandit Tai Bao Ashu and his accomplices, the telegram inquired whether it would be appropriate to comply with public sentiment and approve their execution in Zhangyan Town, Jinshan County, requesting instructions for compliance. Superintendent Zhang telegraphed Commander Cao the day before yesterday, approving the execution of the two bandits. The original telegram stated briefly that the captured bandit leaders Tai Bao Ashu and Xu Fusheng had committed heinous crimes and approved the requested action, ordering immediate execution and reporting back for record-keeping. The following is a transcript of Tai Bao Ashu's confession: Xu Tianxiong, also known as Zhengming, or Tai Bao Ashu, 31 years old, from Jinshan County, served as a platoon leader in the newly formed 16th Division 7th Company of the Revolutionary Army and as a joint defense squad leader under Chen Xiongzhou in Lishui. He joined the Communist army on March 8th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, starting his gang in Liujia Yanqiao. At that time, there were only three of us: Wang Amei, also known as Qiming, nicknamed Piggy Girl, and Zhang Tongsheng, also known as Long Legs Pai Si Quan, with about 300 followers, about 10 to 20 guns, including rifles and Mauser pistols. The boats were found outside. In September, introduced by Weng Mingzheng from Jinshan, we joined Yan Huchen, sent by Qu Qiubai of the Red Party, and were appointed as Commander of the Jiangsu Fourth Route Mobile Detachment of the Party Protection and National Salvation Army, carrying out red work and waiting for an opportunity to revolt. Later, due to the interruption of supplies, we could not maintain ourselves and began to rob. However, when we arrived at a place, we initially borrowed from people, and we sometimes encountered troops, but neither side opened fire. It was not because the troops had inside information with us, but because the number of troops that came out was limited, and they knew that their strength was not equal to ours, so they dared not fight with us. We have always adhered to the principle of not offending others unless they offend us, so we were just so-so. I originally had a lot of guns, mostly robbed from Yaqian, Xincang, and Xinmiaogang, totaling about one hundred and several dozen. After the two major battles of Gaoxu and Zhujiahe, they were almost completely lost. The remaining ones were distributed by Zhang Tongsheng, Song Xiqing, Shen Ziqing, etc. (currently committing crimes in the Baili Baitang area). Now there are only 15 rifles, 7 Mauser pistols, and 1 machine gun left. Several guns were confiscated by the Zhejiang Security Team on the 19th day of the first month of the lunar calendar last year. The rest were handed over to my brother Xu Fusheng for safekeeping. I don't know where they are hidden. I also have appointment letters from the Communist Party's Yan Huchen and various places, as well as various counterfeit seals, such as the Commander of the Fourth Route Mobile Detachment of the Party Protection and National Salvation Army, the Commander-in-Chief of the Second Front Army of the Jiangsu Fourth Route of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Republic of China, and the Commander of the Songhu Eight Counties Guerrilla Army. I have also appointed many regimental commanders, battalion commanders, and boat captains, and I can't remember them all for a while. I only remember the big ones, such as Deputy Division Commander Wang Qiming, First Regiment Commander Zhang Tongsheng, Second Regiment Commander Wang Youru, Third Regiment Commander Zhao Guomin, Political Department Li Wenjun, Chen Xiongzhou, and Gu Peizhang, battalion commanders Tao Hulong, Pan Musheng, He Yinyu, and more than ten others. The many people listed in the bandit roster were indeed all appointed by me. Speaking of the kidnapping and robbery cases committed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, we have really done a lot, and there is no need to describe them in detail. Even if I say it, I can't remember clearly, but roughly speaking, there are one thousand several hundred cases. Even the firefights with the police have happened several times. As for the French woman kidnapped at Dianshan Lake and the killing of the Public Security Bureau Chief and the District Head in Lüxiang, I also did it. In short, I can be regarded as a leader among bandits and a strongman of the Communist Party. There is no need to say anything more.</p>
<p>Local Communication</p>

<p>A Private Mail Boat Robbed Mid-Way: A certain private mail boat traveling between Changshu and Suzhou was robbed yesterday morning (the 15th) while sailing through Wuta.

<p>Reaction to Stamp Inspection Not Following Scheduled Dates: The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the silk and satin industry association stating that the local stamp tax bureau does not follow the scheduled periods to inspect stamps together with the public security police, thereby causing harassment to merchants and civilians. They requested the chamber of commerce to forward a petition for strict prohibition. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce immediately petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Provincial Stamp and Tobacco Tax Bureau to issue a notice to prohibit this, but it was not approved. After receiving the reply, the Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of representatives from the industry association and resolved to send letters to all county chambers of commerce, unanimously advocating for the continuation of the petition to the Ministry of Finance for instructions.</p>

<p>Another Case of Illegally Printing Silkworm Seed Qualification Certificates: The Liu Yuanlong Printing Shop outside Guangfu Gate in this city illegally printed silkworm seed qualification certificates. Witnesses have already been handed over to the court for interrogation. Unexpectedly, Sun Zhinan, the owner of the Youyi Zhai Printing Shop under Shengxiang Bridge in the city, also illegally printed 1,400 of these qualification certificates and took them to the home of Sun Zanqing, who sells silkworm seeds, asking him to sell them. As Zanqing was in Shanghai on business and not at home, Sun's mother paid 75 yuan and bought all of them. Zanqing returned home the day before yesterday and realized that they were counterfeit certificates. He immediately turned Sun Zhinan in to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and Branch Chief Gao transferred him to the General Bureau, which then transferred him to the County Court. Prosecutor Zhu opened a court for investigation. As a result, the plaintiff was ordered to return, and the defendant was detained pending investigation.</p>

More than 1,400 red pills, more than ten taels of pill ash, three opium pipes, and a set of mahjong tiles were seized. They were immediately taken to the team, and the team leader opened a court for interrogation. The tobacco offenders confessed to selling and smoking drugs. Yesterday, they were presented to Wuxi and sent to the district office for investigation.</p>

<p>Conclusion of a House Collapse Fatality: The case of Shi Honglang's house in Shijia Lane, Beiwai, collapsed due to a fire. He was building a house a few days ago when his cousin Shi Ganrong removed the roof supports and damaged the foundation. On the afternoon of the 13th, Qian Shunpei was delivering soil bricks and pushed them into the house, causing a collapse that crushed him to death. Yesterday morning (the 14th), Supervising Officer Wu, along with the coroner, went to inspect the body and confirmed that Qian Shunpei was crushed to death. In the afternoon, Shi Honglang, his sister-in-law Shi Xu, the deceased's father Qian Xiangbao, the water worker Qian Rugen, and the perpetrator Qian Ganrong were interrogated. Shi Xu testified that she saw Ganrong damage the foundation, causing the house to collapse. The deceased's father stated in court that he did not want to pursue the matter. After the interrogation, the water worker Qian Rugen was instructed to compensate the deceased. Ganrong was placed in the custody of bailiffs, and the court adjourned. It was later learned that Ganrong was willing to pay 350 yuan as compensation for funeral expenses to settle the matter.</p>
<p>The Dasheng Bao Newspaper Is About to Be Published: After the Minsheng Shangbao and Jiangyin newspapers ceased publication, only the Chengqing Dangbao and Jiangsheng Bao remained.

The entire file of the Ji-Cai case has been sent to the High Court, as there are still cases involving Xing Songwen, the former district head of the First District, Assistant Xu Yan, Zhou Qiujiang, a former committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, and Xu Awu, a newspaper deliverer, that have not been investigated. These files must be reviewed before investigation can begin.</p>
<p>Danyang</p>

<p>Argument Between Father and Son Leads to Death: Wang Zibao, a farmer in Xiangcao Village, had three sons. The eldest son, Xiaozhen, was unfilial and addicted to opium. Last night, Zibao advised him with good words, but Xiaozhen responded with vicious words. Zibao was momentarily angered, picked up a stone, and accidentally broke Xiaozhen's forehead, causing brain matter to flow out, resulting in immediate death. The district public office in that area learned of the matter and has sent Wang Zibao to the county government for investigation.</p>
<p>Autopsy Ordered in Murder Case: Zhu Alin from Jiangjia Township, Beixiang, was doing business outside. In December of last year, he returned home with his fellow villager Wei Chuanxiao and others. He died halfway, and his body has already been coffined. His elder brother, Farong, believed that his brother's death was unclear and filed a petition with the county government requesting an autopsy. County Magistrate Shen, upon receiving the petition, deemed the matter related to human life and appointed a supervising officer to conduct an autopsy with the coroner at Dananmen yesterday. The autopsy revealed that the kidneys and testicles were crushed, confirming that he had been murdered. The search for the murderer is underway.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The Qingxiang Bureau Orders the Formation of Self-Defense Corps: The Jiangsu Provincial Qingxiang Bureau believes that during the Qingxiang period, self-defense corps should be organized in accordance with the Self-Defense Corps Law. If there is no organization of self-defense corps after the Qingxiang is completed, it will not be sufficient to consolidate the people's self-defense foundation, and the previous efforts will inevitably be in vain, and the people will still not be able to live and work in peace permanently. The Qingxiang affairs in various counties are mostly scheduled to end at the end of March. It is urgent to quickly organize the self-defense corps in various districts according to law. The districts that have already been organized should also be inspected and reorganized to ensure that the entire effort is completed and permanent peace is maintained. Yesterday, instructions were issued to the Qingxiang Bureaus of various counties to list the organization and reorganization situations in detail and report them to the department for verification.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Supervisory Committee May Not Establish a Chairman: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee previously inquired whether the county chamber of commerce supervisory committee could establish standing committee members or a chairman, as there were no explicit regulations on this matter. Yesterday, it received a reply from the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee, stating that according to the regulations in Article 21 of the Chamber of Commerce Law and its implementation rules, the chamber of commerce supervisory committee should only temporarily elect one person as chairman when meeting. At times other than meetings, there is no need to establish one. After receiving the letter, the Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, in addition to sending a letter to the provincial government, has instructed the party departments of various counties to notify them for their information. Conduct Cooperation Business Lectures. The Zhenjiang County Government, in order to promote cooperative businesses, enable members of various societies to clearly understand the meaning of cooperation, and promote rural business cooperation, has specifically scheduled a Zhenjiang County Cooperative Business Lecture Conference at the Provincial Agricultural and Mining Products Exhibition Hall on April 21st and 22nd. In addition to speeches by Provincial Government Chairman Ye and Agricultural Department Director He, cooperative experts Tang Qiyu and Tong Yumin will also be invited to give lectures.</p>

<p>Large-Scale Joint Suppression of Bandits by Army, Navy, and Police: In recent years, the counties of Tong, Ru, Chong, and Hai have been plagued by bandits, and robbery cases have sprung up, causing the people to suffer deeply. The work of suppressing bandits is indeed urgent. It is heard that the provincial government has instructed the Coastal Patrol Office of the entire province and the Fourth Water Police District to quickly dispatch large detachments of army and navy, as well as two aircraft, to thoroughly suppress the bandit troubles in the counties of Tong, Ru, Chong, and Hai, and has designated Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th Water Police Team stationed in Chongming, as the commander of the bandit suppression operation, and decided to strictly encircle and suppress the bandit strongholds in counties such as Lügao and Qidong, in order to completely resolve the problem. It is heard that the Naval Patrol Office has dispatched four warships. After receiving the order a few days ago, Captain Gong also led the team headquarters under his jurisdiction, as well as the Pingyang, Jinghai, and Jingdong warships, to Jiangbei to jointly suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>Building a Motor Road Along the Coast of Northern Jiangsu: The coastline of Northern Jiangsu, from Lüsi Port to Yancheng, extends for more than six hundred li. Due to inconvenient transportation, sea bandits lie in wait, making it difficult for the army to suppress them. Recently, the military and political authorities have agreed to allocate pacification troops to use the original Fan Dike to expand and build a motor road. Once the engineering team is organized, work will begin immediately.</p>
<p>Sea Bandits Scattered from Lüsi: Sea bandits causing trouble in the Lüsi area are now scattered by boat due to official suppression. There are still bandit boats drifting on the ocean surface, listening for land movements.</p>

Then, the lottery was divided into four groups, and the extracted numbers were 09, 38, 65, and 96. Regardless of the denominations of 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, or 10 yuan, those bonds whose last two digits are the same as the extracted numbers have won the lottery.</p>

<p>Having recently read the news article on the 13th of this month in your newspaper regarding the use of the Huai River Conservancy Commission's Boxer Indemnity funds, much of the content does not match the facts. During the meeting held by this commission on March 11, Committee Member Li Yishe did propose this motion, but after discussion, it was generally believed that the Boxer Indemnity funds were still pending, and the case should be reserved for further discussion. The principle was not approved, nor was it resolved that "the matter would be handled immediately after the Boxer Indemnity funds are allocated." The interest was not mentioned at all. Fearing that the rumors are untrue and would cause misunderstandings, please investigate and publish this entire letter to correct the record.

<h3 id="e13">Ministry of Education Investigates the Number of Overseas Students <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education sent two types of survey forms (A and B) for Chinese students to various embassies abroad, requesting them to fill them out locally in order to compile statistics on overseas students. The original letter stated, "We are currently in the process of compiling statistics on Chinese students studying abroad and have formulated two types of survey forms, A and B. Form B has been sent to your embassy with a request to fill it out. However, the countries are vast and the students are scattered everywhere. Relying solely on the embassy's direct handling may not be sufficient. Moreover, Form B only surveys students who have not returned to China. As for those who have returned to China and those who have been studying abroad for many years, it is extremely difficult to investigate due to the political changes and the scattering of documents in the country. Therefore, we have specifically formulated an English survey form and plan to forward it to various schools above the specialty level in your country of residence for their consideration and filling out in order to ensure accuracy and avoid omissions. In addition to sending separate letters, we are enclosing the forms for your investigation and forwarding, and we request that they be filled out and returned. Sincerely, to various embassies abroad."</p>

<p>Report Private Primary Schools That Have Not Been Registered</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department ordered the education bureaus of various counties, stating, "According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education on the registration of private primary schools, county education bureaus shall approve the registration of elementary primary schools and report it to the Education Department for record-keeping. The Education Department shall approve the registration of complete primary schools, which has already been notified for compliance. At present, there are quite a few private primary schools in various counties that have applied for registration, but there are still some who delay reporting or intentionally evade it. If we do not conduct a careful assessment, we will not only violate the law, but also mislead children and cause harm. In addition to issuing separate orders, we are hereby instructing your director to comply with the order and quickly submit a list of private primary schools that have been approved for registration before this year. Those that have not been registered should also submit a detailed list for examination. You should also instruct them to quickly proceed with the registration in accordance with the prescribed procedures. Violators will be severely punished.

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Holds a Meeting to Welcome Them</p>
<p>The 2nd annual meeting of the Chinese Children's Education Society was held at the Shanghai Municipal Council Northern District Primary School for three days from the 18th to the 20th.

The annual meeting preparation committee has been preparing everything for the past few days. Children from various countries have joined the performance, and the achievements of the exhibition are from countries such as Japan, the United States, and France.

<h3 id="e17">Wang Maozu Gave a Lecture on Education Policy <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Gave a Speech at Shanghai High School Yesterday and Will Go to Wuxi Today</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Maozu, the principal of Suzhou Middle School, has been serving in education for more than ten years and has made great contributions to education in our country. He came to Shanghai yesterday to give a lecture on education policy at Shanghai High School. The audience was very satisfied. The following is a brief summary of his lecture:</p>
<p>I. The constitution or constitution should be based on the educational purpose of the Republic of China and Article 13 of the domestic policy of the Kuomintang platform to compile a special chapter on education.</p>
<p>II. Education funds in each province and county must be guaranteed independently, then reorganized and increased, and the nature of tax revenue should be assessed and the proportion of various educational uses should be allocated. For tax revenues with universality, where the poor and the rich share equally, such as the salt surcharge tax, most of it should be used for compulsory education, mass education, and primary vocational schools.</p>
<p>III. Livelihood education advocates breaking the habit of schools and changing to production-oriented vocational education. For example, agricultural farms are currently being established in various counties. Primary agricultural schools should be established on the farms. Provincial factories should seek to be restored, and model factories should be established in various counties, and industrial training classes should be established in the factories.</p>
<p>IV. Teacher training is the basis for promoting compulsory education. If the current quality and quantity cannot be taken care of economically and time-wise, the quantity should be expanded first, methods should be found to encourage it, and the length of service should be stipulated, and annual seniority increases should be implemented.</p>
<p>V. Secondary education: junior high school focuses on universality, and senior high school focuses on selection and concentration. A four-three system is adopted, or students are separately admitted to higher education and employment. The curriculum for students entering higher education is consistent for six years, while the curriculum for employment is four years.</p>
<p>VI. Quickly determine the amount of scholarships for poor students so that students who are poor and hardworking can enter higher education without being restricted by economics.</p>
<p>VII. Higher education: National universities should be enriched, provincial universities should not be established, and private universities should be rewarded and subsidized and restrained at the same time. Universities should be established in Mongolia and Tibet to recruit students from inland, give them awards, and stipulate service regulations in order to develop frontier undertakings and develop culture. Specialized schools should be established more and cooperate with large factories, such as paper mills can open paper-making specialty schools, which should be rewarded by the state.</p>
<p>VIII. Overseas Chinese education is not worried about lack of money, but about lack of talent. A training class for overseas Chinese teachers should be established in the Fujian and Guangdong normal schools, courses for studying the life problems of overseas Chinese should be added, and local diplomatic personnel should be evaluated for their efforts in education.</p>
<p>IX. Establish a compilation and translation museum under the Central Research Institute, reward writings, and X. Guarantee educational personnel, stipulate examination methods, and implement annual seniority salary increases and pension system. It is heard that Mr. Wang has also accepted the invitation of President Gao of Wuxi Education College and will go to Wuxi to give a lecture on mass education.</p>

<p>Charity Football Match</p>
<p>丨This Sunday at the China Baseball Field丨</p>
<p>Lineups Determined</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Football Match, sponsored by the China National Sports Federation, is scheduled to take place this Sunday (the 19th) at 3 PM at the China Baseball Field. As the football season is about to end, this grand and charitable Sino-Western match serves as a fitting finale, which is worthy of our anticipation.</p>
<p>The Chinese Team's Lineup</p>
<p>The Chinese team's lineup has not yet been officially announced. However, according to our sources, it has been internally decided that it will be the same Chinese team that won this year's All-China Football Championship. It is possible that some adjustments may be necessary due to player availability. For example, Luo Haiguang, the left inside forward, previously played for the East China team and was hospitalized for treatment after an injury. Although he has recovered without medication, it is uncertain whether he will still be able to play for China. However, Chen Hongguang has recovered well and can easily take his place. The most difficult point is the central player of the Chinese team. Chen Zhenhe is certainly a suitable candidate, but he is also a crucial forward and it is difficult to move him. Zhuang Shihong has not fully recovered from his injuries, so how can he be asked to play again? Li Ning is not familiar with the position, so how can he be forced into it? Therefore, we can only rely on Feng Yunyou. Chen Jiaqiu is better as a right outside forward than a right inside forward. If the "two Guangs" (Luo Haiguang and Chen Hongguang) play side by side, then Chen Jiaqiu will be able to showcase his skills. The following lineup is the best we can offer and will surely bring us good results:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Jiang Shanqing, Chen Pu, Feng Yunyou, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>The Western Customs Team's Lineup</p>
<p>The Western Customs team, having won the three major championships this year, has agreed to be one of the main attractions of this year's Sino-Western charity match. The lineup has also been revealed. According to experts, the team's overall talent is outstanding. A detailed introduction is provided below for the reference of the Chinese athletes. As the saying goes, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." The goalkeeper is named Blatley. His talent is slightly inferior to Zhou Xianyan, but he is considered a giant among Westerners. Gerbertson and Scott will play as the left and right fullbacks. In recent matches, they have given us the impression of being "solid and reliable." The center back line of Whis Ujal Shucheden is the strongest point of the team. Their undefeated record this season is due to this line. The forwards, Okeley, Jack, Farlas, Turner, and Wilkinson, are known as the "Five Tigers of the Sea." They are strong and have powerful shots. When we meet them, we will know their skills.</p>
<p>Blatley, Scott, Gerbertson, Hrey Ujal, Shucheden Whis, Wilkinson, Turner, Farlas, Jack, Okeley</p>
<p>Income and Funds</p>
<p>With these two famous Sino-Western teams as the main attractions of the charity match, there is no doubt that it will be an unprecedented event in Shanghai. Currently, the disaster situation in Shaanxi and Gansu is severe, and people are dying of starvation. If the proceeds from ticket sales can be used for donations, it would be a small contribution. It is hoped that this will be supported by both spectators and players. However, the Federation has remained silent so far, presumably because a decision has not been made. It is said that the Federation has decided to use the proceeds to purchase children's hospital beds for the Children's Welfare Association and to provide relief to beggars for the Women's Temperance Society. It is not known if this is true.</p>

<p>Grand Opening Ceremony - The Great Undertaking of the Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>丨700 Athletes Participating丨Over 10,000 Spectators丨</p>
<p>President Hu Wenhu Delivers Opening Address, Consul General Chen Delivers Speech</p>
<p>丨Men's 100-Meter Preliminary Round Breaks National Record丨</p>
<p>(Singapore Correspondence, April 3) The Malayan Overseas Chinese Sports Meet, which has been in preparation for years, finally opened grandly at the Jalan Besar Stadium today at 10 AM, amidst the enthusiastic support of over 10,000 people. With months of painstaking effort, today's excellent results have been achieved, which can be said to be worthy of this undertaking. It will be seen that a brilliant flower will be opened widely in the history of sports in the South Seas, and the national spirit will also be further stimulated. Therefore, today's grand event cannot be said to be unimportant. The circumstances before and after the opening of the conference are described in sections below.</p>
<p>The Rain Suddenly Clears</p>
<p>The weather in the South Seas is often unpredictable. It can be sunny one moment and rainy and windy the next. This is a common occurrence for those who have lived here for a long time. Before 8 AM this morning, it suddenly rained heavily. The general audience was worried, as if the weather did not cooperate, this solemn opening ceremony might be suspended, which would be cause for concern.</p>
<p>Beautiful Venue Layout</p>
<p>Outside the venue, the words "Malayan Overseas Chinese Sports Meet" were written in large characters. Above, the emblems of China and England were hung high. In the southeast corner of the venue, a platform was set up. Behind the platform, a white cloth was used as a screen, respectfully displaying a portrait of Sun Yat-sen. The portrait was surrounded by beautiful and eye-catching colorful flowers and crossed national flags. On both sides of the platform, two tables were placed, on which were placed prizes from important figures and celebrities at home and abroad. The door of the platform and the surrounding area were decorated with green leaves. On the upper left corner of the platform, a loudspeaker was placed for issuing commands. The venue was filled with national flags, especially the national flag of our country. Small flags with slogans such as "The world is for all under the Great Way," "The Three Principles of the People," "Long Live the Republic of China," and "Support the Party and the Nation" were also hung every three to five small flags.</p>
<p>Lively Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>There were about 10,000 Chinese and Western spectators, as well as teachers and students from various schools. Around 8 AM, athletes from various districts, such as Singapore, Penang, Selangor, Johor, and others, successively entered the venue in orderly formations, with organized steps. Some sang school songs, while others sang party songs. The sound was loud, almost stopping the clouds. The athletes from each team were full of energy. The first team was the entire staff of the Malayan Overseas Chinese Sports Meet, the second team was the athletes from the Selangor district, the third team was the athletes from the Perak district, the fourth team was the athletes from the Penang district, the fifth team was the athletes from the Negeri Sembilan district, and the sixth team was the athletes from the Singapore district. The opening ceremony was held at 9 AM. The Yangzheng Military Band led the way, circling the venue. Each team had a school flag and a national flag as its guide. In front of the military band was the conference flag and the national flag. Afterwards, students from various schools marched around the stadium in lines of four, winding like a snake on Changshan Mountain. For a time, the sound of military music, whistles, and footsteps echoed each other, creating a solemn atmosphere. When the order was given to raise the flag in the fourth item, the athletes and spectators in each district applauded thunderously. The order of the ceremony and the speeches are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Consul General Chen's Speech</p>
<p>In brief, he said, "Today is the opening ceremony of the Malayan Overseas Chinese Sports Meet. Athletes from various districts of Malaya have gathered here to compete in sports, to promote and increase their physical and mental health. It is a grand and unprecedented event. I am very honored to be able to participate in this grand event. I hope that the athletes from various districts will show their spirit and strive to achieve the goal of participating in this event and winning. I hope that the athletes from various districts will strictly abide by the order of the entire venue. Every competition should be regarded as a friendly competition. All actions should be for the glory of the team and for the honor of our nation."</p>
<p>Report on the Preparation Process</p>
<p>Chief of Preparations Lin Jindian said in general, "Today is the day of the Malayan Conference. I am honored to be able to attend this grand event. Looking back on the initiation of the conference, it was actually in early May of last year. Two weeks later, the initiating meeting drafted the program, and two weeks later, the chairman and vice-chairman were elected, and the heads of each department were appointed. On June 14th, the Preparations Office was established. I was mistakenly elected by the public as the director of the Preparations Office in October. Thanks to the support of my colleagues, I have worked hard and dared not slacken. Fortunately, each district pre-selected and successively held events, and the conference was able to be opened. This is not the work of the Preparations Office staff, but the performance of the enthusiasm of the entire overseas Chinese community for sports. Since the establishment of the Preparations Office, we have worked hard on publicity, but due to limited capabilities, the publicity was not thorough, and a few overseas Chinese were unable to send representatives, which is very regrettable. I hope that next year, when the Chinese Conference is held elsewhere, all Malayan overseas Chinese will have representatives to participate. As for the expenses of the Preparations Office, in addition to the donations from me and Hu Wenbao, totaling 3,000 yuan, Hu Wenhu temporarily filled out 5,000 yuan and did not solicit any donations from the outside world. Now that the conference is hastily opened, the preparations are not complete, and I hope that the athletes from various districts will forgive me, and I hope that everyone will work together in each spirit to make this conference a complete success. Time is short, so I will give this simple report."</p>
<p>Hu Wenhu's Opening Address</p>
<p>The President of the Conference, Hu Wenhu, delivered the opening address, saying, "The initiation of the Malayan Overseas Chinese Sports Meet has been going on for ten months. Thanks to the hard work of the staff of the Preparations Office and the sincere cooperation of sports enthusiasts in various districts, today we have this solemn opening ceremony, with thousands of men and women from eight districts working together to compete without contention. Sports leaders from all over Malaya are guiding us to develop sports among the people and promote the spirit of the nation. It is truly an unprecedented event in Malaya. The significance of sports lies in improving the lives of human beings. Organized training has methods. Every action must be in accordance with the rules. We must strive to make it scientific. The manners and postures must strive to be beautiful. The speed and slowness of running must strive to be flexible. We must strive to make it artistic. A small skill can be perfected over time. The way to success is to be persistent and tireless, so as to cultivate a firm and diligent character. Forming teams and working together is a joint effort. The loss of one person can affect the whole situation, so as to cultivate the habit of teamwork. In the arena, referees are publicly elected, and orders and resolutions must be respected and obeyed, so as to cultivate the spirit of obedience to discipline. From this point of view, the purpose of promoting sports is not to train a group of violent and reckless people who are good at fighting, but to seek the balanced development of virtue, intelligence, physical fitness, and aesthetics, and to cultivate a great personality. The more overseas Chinese are abroad, the further away they are from their homeland, the criticisms of being 'sick men' and 'loose sand' are constantly heard, and the improper habits and irregular lifestyles are destroying their race and causing shame to the country. The opening of the conference will make the atmosphere of sports permeate the South Seas. The morale will be boosted, and the spirit will be multiplied. When the entire overseas Chinese community hears about it, the stubborn and cowardly will have the ambition to stand up. It is not shallow that it is beneficial to the people and the country. I am not talented, but I am fortunate to attend this grand event. I respectfully offer my humble words to express my sincerity. Although the words are limited, the meaning is endless. I, my elders, brothers, sisters, please remember it." The Vice President of the Conference, Liang Xinnan, delivered a speech, saying in brief, "Today, the Malayan Overseas Chinese will hold the opening ceremony here. Athletes from all over Malaya are participating, so that this unprecedented conference will be successful. This is due to the strong promotion and sacrifice of the Preparations Committee members and the enthusiastic overseas Chinese in various places. Without the spirit of time, today's grand occasion could not have been achieved. In recent years, the progress of our British overseas Chinese in sports and the expression of the spirit of the nation have been advancing by leaps and bounds. I hope that the athletes from various districts will work hard and live up to the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese in various places in promoting this Malayan Overseas Chinese Sports Meet, and establish a permanent and strong foundation for our Chinese nation." (Applause) Another Vice President of the Conference, Zhang Kaichuan, delivered a speech.</p>

<p>Inspection Period Scheduled for One Year</p>
<p>Newly Appointed to the Rank of General</p>
<p>Zou Zuohua, the commissioner for land reclamation in the Xing'an region, was ordered by Zhang Xueliang to go to Europe and America to inspect land reclamation projects. Xu Kechang, deputy section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was also transferred to assist him. Zou and his party took a ferry prepared by the China Flag Shipping Company at the New Customs Wharf yesterday morning at around 10 AM, and went directly to the Dalae Wharf in Pudong to board the Adam President, a ship of the Dalae Company, to set sail. The ship set anchor at 12:30 PM yesterday. Those who went to the New Customs Wharf to see him off included Tang Liu and his wife, the director of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Song Menghu, the secretary of the land reclamation commissioner's office in the Xing'an region, and Liu, the director of the agricultural affairs section, among others. In addition to Xu Kechang, Zou was also accompanied by a German female secretary. According to Zou, he told our reporter yesterday that he planned to go to France first, then to England, Germany, Austria, Italy, and other countries to conduct inspections. Finally, he would go to the United States. The trip is expected to take one year. The travel expenses are entirely provided by Vice Commander Zhang. Mr. Song Menghu also plans to go with him, but because the affairs of the land reclamation office have not been completed, he still needs to return to the Xing'an region to take care of them. In the future, he will transfer to Europe from Siberia. Furthermore, it is reported that Zou received an order from the central government the day before yesterday, promoting him to the rank of general.</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Sinking of the Dachang: Details <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Crew Confirms Seven People Missing</p>
<p>Responsibility Issues Awaited Customs Investigation</p>
<p>The sinking of the Dahua Company's Dachang ship, which was hit by the Ping'an Company's export ship Dahua No. 1 outside the Wusong mouth on the evening of the day before yesterday at 8:30 PM, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Here are the details obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>The Incident</p>
<p>On the evening of the day before yesterday (the 14th) at 8:30 PM, the Dachang ship was carrying 600 tons of coal from the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company and about 60-70 passengers to Shanghai from Dabu. At that time, when it was about 20 miles away from the Wusong mouth, at the second river, it saw the Dahua ship exporting and heading straight for it. The Dachang immediately sounded the horn and steered north to avoid it, but it was hit by the bow of the Dahua ship, resulting in a major disaster.</p>
<p>Captain Sought Help</p>
<p>In order to avoid the Dahua ship, the Dachang ship's bow had turned north, causing it to be hit hard on the starboard side of the waist by the Dahua. The engine room was directly hit, and after the hole was penetrated, water immediately flooded in and gradually sank. The captain, Yi Renbake (transliteration) (NBOYKO), saw that the ship had been hit and planned to steer the ship to the shore for easy rescue, but the machine was damaged and the rudder was ineffective, so he dropped anchor and sent up flares for help. After causing the accident, the Dahua continued to move forward due to the darkness of the night. After seeing the flares for help, it turned around to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Rescue Situation</p>
<p>When the accident happened, there were no other ships entering or leaving. Although rockets were launched, no ships responded. At about 9 PM, the Dahua returned and approached the anchor, and lowered several sampans. The crew and passengers of the Dachang were able to cross over to the ship one after another, about 100 people. By that time, it was about 10 o'clock, and the Dachang had completely sunk. The Dahua then returned to Wusong and sailed to Shanghai yesterday morning. The victims landed at the South City Wharf.</p>
<p>Passengers Rescued</p>
<p>In addition to carrying coal, the ship also had 60-70 passengers, most of whom were extremely poor. Some were homeless and came to Shanghai to seek work. About 30-40 people were rescued, so after arriving in Shanghai, they all left the ship and went elsewhere without reporting to the company. As a result, the exact number of people rescued and lost is still unknown.</p>
<p>Crew Inspection</p>
<p>The ship had a total of 64 crew members. In addition to those who escaped, the missing included comprador Pang Jinquan, second comprador Wang Yongyao, third helmsman Wang Pinsheng, carpenter Chen Pigen, stoker Xu Qinglan, oiler Yun Ren, and cook Tian Lai, totaling seven people.</p>
<p>Aftermath Arrangements</p>
<p>The crew members who were rescued and arrived in Shanghai reported to the company and inquired about the aftermath arrangements. Yan, the wife of carpenter Chen Pigen, also came to the company and demanded to see her husband, crying and stamping her feet. Despite the persuasion of others, she was still ineffective. As a result, the staff were unable to handle the matter. Later, Yao Zhongxuan, a staff member, gave the head of the sailors, Tang, 75 yuan and ordered him to distribute 5 yuan to each of the sailors as temporary food and lodging expenses. The workers were not convinced by the verbal agreement, so Yao wrote a written acknowledgement before they dispersed. Chen Pigen's wife, Yan, was still not convinced, but after persuasion from Min Xinwu, the owner of the Tongde ship, she took 5 yuan and left.</p>
<p>Negotiation Procedures</p>
<p>After the owner reported the sinking of the Dachang, the Dahua Company sent a letter to the Customs and the Shipping Association and entrusted lawyer Xi Yuchang to conduct negotiations. The Ping'an Company also hired a lawyer. Yesterday, there were letters exchanged to serve as notification, but the issue of losses has not yet been raised.</p>
<p>Responsibility Issues</p>
<p>The responsibility for the collision between the Dahua and the Dachang was investigated by the Guowen News Agency reporter from both sides, each holding its own view. According to the Dachang, the ship saw the green light of the Dahua and immediately avoided it at an angle of 120 degrees. At that time, if the Dahua could have also avoided it slightly to the right, the collision would not have occurred. However, the ship went straight ahead without avoiding it, causing its bow to hit the abdomen of the Dachang ship, which was beyond rescue. According to the Dahua, the ship saw that the ship was close and immediately braked and sounded the distress signal four times. However, the incoming ship did not brake, but instead wanted to go around the left side of the Dahua's bow to go faster, causing its abdomen to touch our bow. The accounts of events are different, making it difficult to prove who is right and wrong. It is expected that after a thorough investigation by the Customs, the truth will be revealed.</p>
<p>Brief History of the Two Ships</p>
<p>The Dachang ship is owned by the Dahua Company at 41 Gongguan Road in this city, with a load capacity of 1,600 tons. It was built years ago and is used exclusively for cargo. From the 25th of last month, it was leased to the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company and declared through the Xincheng Honest Broker Company in Yuelai Company on Hankou Road. It traveled between Dabu and Shanghai, specializing in carrying coal. After Zhongxing took over, it only traveled twice before the accident occurred. The losses will be included in the Dachang negotiations. The ship was insured by the Dahua Company for 50,000 taels at the Hua'an Company, but it is less than half of the loss. The Dahua ship is a Dinghai-class ship of the Ping'an Company, with a load capacity of 600 tons. After colliding with the Dachang the night before yesterday, it rescued more than 100 people. It returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. Because the bow was also slightly injured, it was temporarily suspended for repairs. All passengers and cargo will be transferred to the Chuanshan ship today.</p>
<p>Retrieving Bodies</p>
<p>In addition to rescuing more than 100 crew members and passengers, there are still 40-50 people missing. In order to retrieve the bodies, the company sent a letter to the Wusong Rescue Bureau yesterday, requesting to retrieve them and offering a reward of 40 yuan per body. The letter to the Rescue Bureau said, "We hereby inform you that the Dachang ship was sunk by the Dahua ship outside the Wusong mouth at 8:30 PM last night. In addition to those who escaped, seven crew members of the Dachang ship are still missing. We hereby ask your bureau to search for them everywhere. If any bodies are found that match the names of the crew members, a reward of 40 yuan will be given to each body, which will be paid by our company according to the list. We will not go back on our word. We hereby inform you and hope you will investigate and handle the matter."</p>

<p>Annual Meeting of Western Taxpayers</p>
<p>All Seven Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>Purchase of the Great China Hotel Rejected</p>
<p>The annual meeting of Western taxpayers in the Public Settlement was held at the Great Guangming Theater at 2:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Macnaghten, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, presented eight resolutions prepared by the Municipal Council to the meeting for voting. First, Mr. Baker was elected as the chairman of the annual meeting, and Mr. Lyell was appointed as the secretary. Within one hour, all seven resolutions were passed. When discussing the eighth resolution regarding the purchase of the Great China Hotel, the atmosphere became tense. The resolution was proposed by Mr. Harris and seconded by Mr. Fessenden. After the discussion began, five people spoke against it, and one person spoke in favor. The matter was then put to a vote, and it was ultimately rejected by a majority. The Municipal Council's plan to purchase the Great China Hotel, which had attracted attention from various sectors, was thus defeated. The meeting adjourned at 3:40 PM. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>After the first, second, and third resolutions, which were the election of the chairman and secretary, and the adoption of the meeting rules, were completed, Chairman Macnaghten proposed:</p>
<p>Resolution Four: "To pass the municipal report and final accounts for the year ending December 31, 1930." Mr. Macnaghten delivered a report on the proposal, stating that the various municipal affairs handled by the Municipal Council last year had been detailed in the annual report. He would like to add a few words on the more important matters. He hoped that everyone would remember that in June of the previous year, the Municipal Council hired Mr. Craig to assist in implementing the recommendations of the Economy Committee and to join the work of the Salary Committee as secretary. By June of last year, the Salary Committee had submitted a report that was grand in scope and comprehensive in planning. The Municipal Council adopted it after making only a few minor changes, which were still in line with the committee's intentions, but only with different methods. The Municipal Council now has a comprehensive salary scale based solely on merit for promotion. The committee had suggested opening up avenues for Chinese staff to serve in positions with heavier responsibilities, and the Municipal Council expressed its strong agreement. In the future, the policy of hiring will be to employ Westerners only when no suitable Chinese staff can be found. The Municipal Council firmly believes that adopting the Salary Committee's report will greatly benefit the economy of government expenditures. He expressed his gratitude to the committee members for their diligent service to the public. In addition, Mr. Craig also formulated implementation measures for the Salary Committee's recommendations and made many improvements to the Municipal Council's rules of procedure. In the past, the management and authority of municipal affairs were concentrated in the hands of the Director-General. Now, with the development of the region and the increasing complexity of municipal affairs, there is inevitably a risk of administrative overload and slow processing. Mr. Craig has now revised the responsibilities of the heads of various departments to match the increased responsibilities. He has also assembled several departments to form several joint committees to directly handle matters related to those departments, thereby avoiding the trouble of the Director-General's office serving as a hub for consultations and document exchanges. In this way, the efficiency of management is not hindered, personnel are greatly saved, and administration is greatly expedited. In addition, he has also revised the rules of procedure for the Board of Directors, committees, and various departments, eliminating the past defects of unclear responsibilities. Future administration will be greatly facilitated. Mr. Craig completed all of the above arduous work in March. The Board of Directors was completely satisfied, and the Municipal Council and the public benefited greatly. At last year's annual meeting of taxpayers, there was the most pessimistic</p>
<p>commentary on the Shanghai Special District Court.</p>
<p>Some Western newspapers also created a widespread impression abroad that the abolition of the Provisional Court and its replacement with the Special District Court was tantamount to a disaster, and that the rights of Westerners and the protection of Western interests were sacrificed for political expediency. Today, I am very happy to inform you that the Special District Court has been very effective in handling criminal cases over the past year. The doubts that Westerners had a year ago have now been dispelled in nine out of ten cases. As you all know, the security and order in the settlement are greatly influenced by the criminal administration of the Special District Court. Last year, the Municipal Council filed charges in a total of 20,883 criminal cases, large and small, of which 19,457 people were convicted and 1,426 were acquitted. In light of the situation in Shanghai, this can be regarded as a record that surpasses the administration of criminal courts in various countries. In addition, there is very little dissatisfaction with the Special District Court's enforcement of criminal law. However, there was no progress on the</p>
<p>issue of road construction beyond the boundaries, which is a pity. Until recently, a method was agreed upon with the local Chinese authorities, and it is hoped that this will allow the road surface to be maintained and repaired from time to time. As for the telephone issue, the Shanghai Telephone Company's purchase of the business property of the China and Foreign Telephone Company was signed into a contract with the Municipal Council on August 5th of last year, obtaining a franchise to quickly rectify the situation and completely renovate the automatic telephone system within two years. Only after this has been completed will it be allowed to increase telephone fees. At the end of February of this year, the company reported on the progress of its work. 43,000 automatic telephones ordered from two factories of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation have been 60% delivered and are currently being installed in fully completed switchboards. The buildings on Bixun Road and Tilanqiao have been completed, the one on Fujian Road is about to be completed, the one on Mintinein Road is 90% completed, and the two in the West and North districts are also 85% completed. The wiring project has created 152 manholes and buried 1,411,000 feet of pipe, laying 572,400 feet of underground and aerial cable, with a total length of 56,450 miles of telephone lines. However, the renovation of new equipment outside the settlement is often interfered with by the Chinese authorities, and the Municipal Council has approved the exemption of its obligations under the contract for roads outside the boundaries.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's final accounts and accounting report for last year</p>
<p>have already been published, and I will now add a few words on several key points. The surplus for last year was 2,271,000 taels, a decrease of more than 1 million taels compared to the budget of 3,277,000 taels. The reason for this has been detailed in the accounting report, and the fall in the price of silver was the biggest reason. Last year, the cost of the police force accounted for 16% of the total revenue. The adoption of several recommendations of the Salary Committee has increased the cost of security, with Chinese police officers benefiting the most. However, although this cost is huge, the public has benefited from it, and I believe that everyone will agree with this. As for the</p>
<p>promotion of education, the revenue used for education last year accounted for 4.6% (excluding investment expenditures). However, since the adoption of the Education Committee's recommendations, the percentage will increase significantly from this year onwards. The Municipal Council currently runs a total of 13 schools, 7 of which educate Chinese children and 6 of which educate foreign children. At the end of last year, there were a total of 3,281 Chinese students, but many students were not able to be admitted due to insufficient school buildings. There were a total of 1,536 foreign students, and several schools have ample space to accommodate more people. As for the addition of a new school for Western children in the West District, although no progress has been made, the Municipal Council is focusing all its efforts on hoping to take concrete steps soon. Since the establishment of the Education Committee in June of last year, it has drafted procedures for expanding public schools and subsidizing private schools. The Municipal Council has already approved them in principle. In addition, there is one more point that I would like to draw your special attention to, which is the accounting report's description of the</p>
<p>disposition of the Electricity Department's sales.</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council sold the Electricity Department, there has been a feeling that the city treasury has received such a large income that it can be taken without end and used without limit. Therefore, please pay special attention to this report to understand the truth and dispel erroneous impressions. I also want to tell you that if the Electricity Department had not been sold, the police donation and land tax would not only not be reduced, but would also increase to 20%. As for the special revenue and expenditure items, the surplus was 3,344,711 taels, an increase of approximately 962,000 taels compared to the budget of 2,382,700 taels. Last year, the Shanghai Electric Power Company paid a total purchase price of 23,500,000 taels, which the Municipal Council used to redeem ten types of municipal bonds (including the gold pound loan of 1920) and to pay for various investment expenditures. However, the original planned building construction program was not fully implemented, and a portion of the funds saved was allocated to cover the land purchase expenses required for widening roads, as there was an unusual development in the reconstruction of buildings within the boundaries that year, which led to a sharp increase in the cost of widening roads. I would now like to submit Resolution Four for your consideration. The chairman then put the resolution to a vote, and it was passed without dissent.</p>
<p>Resolution Five: "To approve the various expenditures in the 1931 budget prepared by the outgoing Board of Directors, as well as its accompanying recommendations, and to authorize the Municipal Council to collect the various taxes listed in the resolution." He also declared to the public that the budget for this year has an explanation attached, which compares the various revenues and expenditures of the current and previous years, so there is no need to repeat the details except for mentioning one or two of the important points. This year, the police donation on Chinese and foreign houses within the settlement will continue to be collected at 14% of the rent, as in the second half of last year, and 12% for those outside the settlement. The land tax will still be collected at 7 per thousand of the assessed value. The estimated surplus for the budget is 310,000 taels of silver, while the surplus for the previous year was 2,271,000 taels.</p>
<p>The current budget is sufficient to offset revenue and expenditure, and it is gratifying that there is no need to increase taxes this year. However, the surplus is too small, which is somewhat unsatisfactory. This may be due to the sharp drop in the price of silver, which has had a direct and indirect impact on various items in the budget. I remember that in my speech at last year's annual meeting, I said that the Municipal Council hoped to maintain the low tax rate for several years. Although the Municipal Council still has this hope, if the exchange rate does not make real progress in the near future, it may be necessary to restore the tax rate that was implemented before July of last year next year. Regarding this section, the public may not fully know that the taxes in Shanghai are approximately lower than those in any major city in Europe and the United States. For example, the United Kingdom often collects about 70% of the rent, and the municipal councils in the United Kingdom often receive subsidies from the government in addition to the municipal donations they collect to undertake certain public affairs. The estimated shortage for this year's special budget is 350,750 taels, while last year there was a surplus of 3,344,700 taels. This is due to the fact that special expenditures this year total 10 million taels, while the purchase price for the sale of the Electricity Department will be paid in installments over several years, and the amount payable this year is only 8 million taels.</p>
<p>The building construction program accounts for a large part of the special budget. Many buildings were included in last year's budget, but the work has not been completed and it is necessary to continue to allocate funds to complete them. The cost of imported building materials has risen due to the fall in the exchange rate, which is also a reason why the building construction program is more expensive. The policy of</p>
<p>purchasing land and widening roads at the appropriate time</p>
<p>is planned to be continued. Since the recent revaluation of land prices, the cost of widening roads has also increased significantly.</p>
<p>Under the item of debt repayment, it is stipulated that the 1931 8% public bond and the debt repayment fund will be stored in batches for the repayment of debts that cannot be redeemed before December 31, 1933, because the final installment of the purchase price of the Electricity Department must be paid on that day.</p>
<p>The procedures for the education policy, which were revised by the Education Committee and approved by the Municipal Council, have been announced and do not need to be repeated. They stipulate that two Chinese girls' middle schools will be established before 1934, and two co-educational Chinese children's primary schools will be built each year between this year and 1928. They also stipulate the procedures for subsidizing private Chinese and foreign schools that the Municipal Council deems should be assisted. According to this program, by the end of 1938, there will be 23 public Chinese children's schools in the settlement. It is estimated that by that time, the public schools will be able to accommodate approximately 7% of the Chinese children of school age in the settlement. The cost required for this program this year is a relatively small amount. It should be known that the Chinese education expenses that you are asked to approve today are still far different from the expenses for public Western children's schools, and the total amount of education expenses (including 150,000 taels allocated for subsidizing various schools) accounts for slightly less than 9% of the Municipal Council's revenue. You should know that in the future, taxpayers will be asked to gradually increase Chinese children's education expenses each year until 1938 (unless there are unforeseen events that prevent or accelerate our progress), when education expenses may account for approximately 16% of the Municipal Council's revenue. I dare to say that you will generously approve this year's expenses, because although the number of Chinese children far exceeds that of Western children, the benefits that they receive from the Municipal Council's stipulated education expenses this year are still only half of the total amount, so there is no reason to be stingy and disapprove them. Moreover, your approval today does not deprive future taxpayers of the right to stop the need. I firmly believe that future taxpayers will also be as enlightened as you and know that this settlement is responsible for contributing progressive educational opportunities to Chinese children within the settlement. In order for Chinese and foreign taxpayers to understand the expenses required for public education, the Municipal Council has decided to set up a separate item for the education budget in the municipal fee accounting. As for the method of raising education funds, whether it is from special donations or other means, it will be discussed in the future. After the declaration, the chairman put the resolution to a vote, and it was unanimously passed by the entire meeting.</p>
<p>Resolution Six: To elect one real estate committee member for this year, Robinson was elected.</p>
<p>Resolution Seven: To elect four annual directors of the Public Dispensary Hospital for this year, Dr. White, Dr. Deng, Cage, and Shepard were elected.</p>
<p>Resolution Eight: To propose the acquisition of the Great China property, the content of which is "to propose that the public acquire the Great China Hotel property for the citizens for use as a park and social hub, provided that the selling price is deemed reasonable by the Municipal Council and that the city treasury's financial resources can still open up necessary open spaces in densely populated areas for implementation. Please await the public's decision." It was proposed by Harris, who also gave a speech to the public, stating that the Municipal Council has not purchased open space for the people for seventeen years. During this period, the Municipal Council's income has increased threefold, and the sale of the Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road has also yielded 1.25 million taels, which is stored for the construction of a new Municipal Hall. Now the opportunity has arrived. If we miss it, it will be a great regret for the Municipal Council. The Great China Hotel is world-renowned and is also a source of pride for the Public Settlement. The Great China property is approximately 60 acres and has convenient transportation. What I propose is to convert the Great China Hotel into a Municipal Hall for annual meetings and concerts, and to build an art gallery and a library. The current dance hall will be preserved, and a swimming pool and an open-air movie theater will be opened. The Great China property is valued at 3.5 million taels, an average of 60,000 taels per acre. The land in its vicinity has now been sold for 125,000 taels per acre, twice the asking price of the Great China property. All the buildings of the Great China Hotel are not priced, so there is no sacrifice in renovation or preservation. There are now more than ten groups that support this proposal. The seconder, Mr. Fessenden, was then followed by Mr. Macnaghten, Chairman of the Municipal Council, who stated that the Municipal Council has published its opinion on this proposal in various newspapers. The Municipal Council firmly opposes this proposal because it believes that it is justified from the perspective of effective municipal administration. The first point that the Municipal Council considers when considering such events is, of course, whether the acquisition of a special property can benefit all residents. The Municipal Council always distinguishes between important and unimportant in any plan that involves the use of large sums of money, does what the public wants, and does not undertake things that are not necessary. The various arguments made by those who advocate the purchase of the Great China property are mostly motivated by emotion and treat the two ends of consolidated finances and interests indifferently. Therefore, it is undoubtedly an emotional effect that a large part of the residents expect to purchase the Great China property as a place for entertainment. There is no sufficient reason to use large sums of money to do this, and there is no real guarantee that the land will be permanently retained for public use for entertainment after it is acquired and developed in the future. Some people have suggested that the municipal organs can be moved there in the future and that some space can be left to serve as a so-called social center, park, or open space. It should be known that moving the municipal organs there is not suitable in terms of economy and practical benefits. This has already been detailed to the public and does not need to be</p>
<p>repeated. As for using it as a social center, it is not only too expensive and beyond our ability, but the land area is also insufficient. As for using it as a</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>park and open space, it is also not suitable in terms of location and area. If this is done, it will only benefit a few relatively wealthy people and will still not be able to alleviate the urgent need for parks and open spaces in the densely populated areas of the settlement. Now, if the Great China property is acquired, the Municipal Council's plan to purchase land in densely populated areas to build parks will have to be abandoned. Moreover, once a large sum of 3.5 million taels is spent, the annual regular budget will increase the burden by approximately 250,000 taels, which may result in an increase in the police donation to make up for it. This is what we should try to avoid as much as possible. After Macnaghten finished his declaration, he asked the public to vote on the proposal. Fessenden immediately stood up to support Harris's opinion and gave a brief speech. Then Macnaghten stood up again to refute Harris's remarks that the Municipal Council had not purchased open space for taxpayers for seventeen years. Finally, he said that the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council had decided not to advocate the purchase of the Great China property. Next, Fukushima, the Japanese director, stood up to correct Harris's misunderstanding of several points in his speech. Next, Wilma, an American taxpayer, stood up to oppose the proposal, and her words were quite激昂, saying that she loved to dance, and the Great China was indeed a beautiful dance place. She knew that Harris also loved to dance, and she had often seen Harris enter and exit the place. However, the Municipal Council was not in the business of theaters, and we would not be affected if we did not have this entertainment venue. Next, Hayashi, the president of the Japanese Road Association, and Inoue, a Japanese taxpayer, spoke out against the proposal one after another. The proposal was then put to a vote, and it was rejected by a majority of opponents.</p>

<p>Preventing Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>According to reliable information, the National Government has ordered the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhengting, to negotiate with the Japanese acting minister, Shigemitsu Aoi, because Japanese fishing vessels have recently been secretly arriving in our territorial waters to fish, harming the livelihood of our fishermen. The matter was resolved by the State Council, stating that since there is no special fishery agreement between China and Japan, the scope of our territorial waters cannot be the base for fishermen from that country, and they must be ordered to withdraw from our coast. After this matter was submitted for negotiation, the Japanese government sent a special envoy to China to negotiate, stating that the Chinese government had not previously prohibited it and that it was related to the livelihood of Japanese fishermen, and requested that it be maintained. It is heard that the authorities sternly rejected it, and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the Jianghai Customs to order all foreign fishing vessels in China to withdraw from our coast starting on May 1st in order to maintain the livelihood of fishermen. After that, foreign fish imports will be treated as commodity transportation and must have a port of origin to prove that they are allowed to be imported. If anyone secretly sells foreign fish to our refrigerated ships, they will be punished.</p>

More than ten days have passed, and the matter remains unresolved. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that the strike was launched without mediation and should be dealt with severely. Out of consideration for their ignorance, the workers were ordered to resume work by a certain date. However, the workers insisted on refusing because the dispute had not been properly resolved. Wang Yuxiang, Zhu Wenbiao, and ten other directors and supervisors of the Hat Makers' Union resigned from their positions to all members on the day before yesterday, and simultaneously submitted a report to the Party and government authorities for record.

<p>Declaration Regarding Zheng Zhensheng's Death in Prison</p>
<p>Requesting Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>Seaman Zheng Zhensheng was arrested in 1925 for helping with the May Thirtieth Strike and plotting to assassinate Wang Chongqing, the foreman of the Yinying Company. He was detained in the Western Prison for five years. He suddenly died in the Western Prison on February 25 of this year. After hearing the news, his wife, Ms. Chai, went to the Seamen's Union to seek redress. The union immediately submitted a report to the central government, which in turn instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry to negotiate on the matter. More than a month has passed, and there is still no progress. Recently, marine engineers have organized the Marine Engineers Association to support Zheng's case and seek redress. The association has issued a declaration, excerpts of which are as follows: "Our fellow seaman and martyr, Zheng Zhensheng, responded with righteous indignation after the May Thirtieth Massacre. He contacted all fellow seamen and launched a strike in support of the nation. Unexpectedly, the foreman Wang Chongqing obstructed the strike. Zheng Zhensheng disregarded his own safety and went directly to his residence to eliminate this menace to the revolutionary cause. However, he failed to achieve his goal and suffered misfortune first. His gun malfunctioned, leading to his arrest and false accusation of robbery and murder. He was sent to the Joint Court for trial. Zheng Zhensheng, still thinking of preserving the reputation of his Ningbo hometown and avoiding implicating his comrades, changed his name from Zheng Fangren, using Fangren, claiming to be from Tanggu. He was sentenced to imprisonment in the Western Prison for five years. As the term was nearing its end, our colleagues and the Seamen's Union repeatedly requested the National Government to negotiate for his release, but the concession authorities, based on consular jurisdiction, required another ten years, creating a stalemate. Recently, Zheng Zhensheng's family suddenly received word from the prison that Zheng Zhensheng had died in prison. According to the date, more than twenty days have passed. The cause of death remains unknown, and he died in prison with grievance and hatred. The news was shocking and caused great suspicion. In addition to the three measures proposed by the Seamen's Union to the central government, we hereby issue a declaration, respectfully requesting assistance from all sectors to redress the wrongs done to Zheng Zhensheng and to uphold justice. We hereby declare this."</p>

<p>Incensed by the French Police Injuring a Person</p>
<p>Xin Haishan was shot and injured by a French constable without cause. After being sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, the Western doctors at the hospital reported that his injuries were very serious and life-threatening. After hearing the news, Ningbo people in Shanghai flocked to the Ningbo Native Place Association, demanding negotiations. They all said that the barbaric actions of the French police had aroused great anger. The association is prepared to submit another request to the authorities for serious negotiations and to punish the Western constable according to the law in order to appease the people. Furthermore, the Seafood Trade Association sent a telegram regarding the case of Xin Haishan being shot by the French police: "To the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the French Municipal Council, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, the various trade associations, and all organizations and newspapers: Our association's member, Xin Haishan, a clerk at Changhe Firm, was shot without cause by Western constable No. 158 of the French police on the 7th of this month at 9 PM while going out on business. The bullet entered from the lower part of the left jaw and went straight through the neck, causing him to fall to the ground unconscious. The Western constable and his Yue policeman colleague immediately moved Xin's body to the side alley of Puanli, hoping to shirk responsibility and escape. At that time, Li Dexuan from Tianjin, who was passing by, witnessed the situation, filled with righteous indignation, and immediately recorded the number of the Western constable. The Chinese policeman in the alley reported the matter to the French police station by telephone, and a car was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Changhe Firm then appealed to our association and sent separate letters to the Native Place Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, which were forwarded to the local government for submission to the French consul for negotiations. This case occurred nearly ten days ago. Xin Haishan's injuries are serious and he is on the verge of death. Even if he recovers, he will be disabled. How will his eight-member family make a living? It is difficult to predict whether the French consul will punish the Western constable No. 158 according to the law and compensate the victim for all losses. However, the French police station has not yet filed a public prosecution and has not shown any intention of punishing the perpetrator or providing compensation. Such indifference clearly shows that the police are protecting the Western constable and disregarding the lives of Chinese people. It is not an exaggeration to say that they are encouraging the constable to commit murder. The purpose of establishing a police force in the concession is to protect the area and safeguard merchants. Now, the Western constable has violated his own duties and dared to trample on merchants and harm good people. Are they using the concession as a shield to disregard human life and ignore the law? Our association cannot bear to sit idly by while a fellow trader's clerk is brutally harmed. We should, based on the facts, telegraphically request those who uphold humanity to seriously negotiate and achieve the goals of punishing the perpetrator, providing compensation, and ensuring that such incidents do not occur again in the future. The matter concerns national dignity and the lives of the people. We beg you to uphold justice, rise up, and provide support. Urgent telegram, awaiting your orders. Hu Xing, chairman of the Shanghai Seafood and Grocery Trade Association."</p>

<p>A Battle with Robbers Last Night</p>
<p>Robbers Commit Robbery on Xin Zha Road</p>
<p>Wang Yongtai Loses Several Hundred Dollars</p>
<p>Detectives and Robbers Exchange Fire</p>
<p>Resulting in Deaths and Injuries on Both Sides</p>
<p>Wang Yongtai Shoe Store, located at No. 1986 Xin Zha Road, was in the process of closing up last night around 10 PM when seven robbers suddenly arrived. Each of them produced a handgun and robbed over two hundred dollars and a silver watch before leaving. Detectives discovered this and pursued them to the corner of Xizang Road and Nanjing Road, where they exchanged gunfire. One robber was killed, and another was captured. One police officer was injured, and three bystanders were hit by stray bullets. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Seven Robbers Commit Robbery at Wang Yongtai Shoe Store. The store is owned by Wang Yisheng from Pudong. It is a single-frontage store with eight or nine clerks and apprentices. They were finishing work and closing up when seven robbers suddenly rushed into the store. Six of them were wearing long gowns, and one was wearing a short gown. They each produced handguns and forced the clerks and apprentices to a corner upstairs, forbidding them from looking directly at them and from making any noise. The robbers then proceeded to rob the store for about ten minutes before heading east. It is estimated that they stole over two hundred dollars and a silver watch.</p>
<p>Alert Detectives. After the robbers fled with their loot, a detective from the Xin Zha Police Station happened to be passing by. He noticed that the Wang Yongtai store was wide open and there was no one inside. He also saw six or seven people rushing out, which aroused his suspicion. He immediately entered the store and asked the clerks if those were robbers. At that time, the clerks, still startled, were afraid to speak frankly. Later, an apprentice blurted out that it was a robbery. The detective immediately turned back and secretly pursued them, following them along Xin Zha Road to North Ni Cheng Bridge, then turning into Xizang Road. Upon reaching the opposite side of the New World, he saw a patrolman from the Lao Zha Police Station, No. 1400. Seeing that the opportunity had arrived, he quickly informed the patrolman, and together they drew their guns and fired. The robbers also returned fire.</p>
<p>Gunfire and Fighting. The confrontation occurred at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road, around 10:30 PM, when there were many pedestrians passing by. Gunfire erupted, and pedestrians scrambled for cover. One robber was hit in the left hand and was captured. The remaining robbers turned east onto Nanjing Road and continued to fire as they fled. The detectives continued to pursue them relentlessly. The robbers fled to the front of the Great East Straw Hat Company at No. 641 Nanjing Road. The detectives pursued them to the front of the Washington Watch Store on the north side and exchanged fire across the street, firing more than ten shots. One robber was killed on the spot. Chinese patrolman Ma Changjun, No. 1400, was also hit in the left shoulder. The remaining robbers took the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>Bystanders Affected. Zhang Dewei (from Ningbo, resident of No. 21 Jie Jin Fang, Kandi Road) was hit in the left foot by a stray bullet. Xu Peigen (from Jiangyin, resident of Huanghe Road, Da Tie Bang, a barber) was hit in the left arm. Shao Rulin (16 years old, from Nantong), an apprentice at the Great East Company, was sleeping on a camp bed in the store when a stray bullet penetrated the store and hit his left big toe. Furthermore, nine holes were pierced in the glass doors and windows of the Great East Company by stray bullets. The injured police officer was sent to the police hospital for treatment. Xu, Zhang, and Shao were all sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Their injuries were not serious.</p>

The execution was scheduled for 10 AM today (the 16th) in Zhangyan Town, Jinshan County. Xu Pucheng, the district chief of the First District of the Jiangsu River Police stationed in Minhang, was ordered to supervise the execution. He had already ordered Detective Captain Huan Guanlin to come to Shanghai to recruit Wang Fusheng, who had been an executioner during the era of the former warlords, to prepare for the execution. He led a large patrol team and all the detectives, escorting the three convicts from Minhang on two small steamers to Zhangyan for strict deployment. The execution was carried out at the appointed time.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Car Dealers Request Careful Review of Vehicle Permits <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from the Human-Powered Vehicle Trade Association regarding the Careful Review of Human-Powered Vehicle Permit Applications and submitted it to the Municipal Government. The petition stated that on the 14th of this month, the Human-Powered Vehicle Trade Association submitted a letter stating that the Municipal Government's 177th municipal meeting had decided to expand the number of human-powered vehicles in the Chinese area to 10,000. The measures were announced on the 11th of this month by the Municipal Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus. Out of the 10,000 vehicles, 7,400 were from the original existing vehicles in Shanghai South Gate and Zhabei, and 1,000 were reserved for Pudong, and 200 were reserved for eliminated three-wheeled vehicles, totaling 1,400 new vehicles. The purpose of increasing the number of human-powered vehicles was to show compassion to the poor and help the coolies. However, how to increase the number of vehicles in order to benefit the poor is a matter that should be considered. If the applicants for new vehicles are indeed coolies and poor people, the number should be increased accordingly to fulfill the original intention of helping the poor. However, in reality, there are many unscrupulous merchants and vehicle vendors among those applying for new vehicles. These vendors sell their existing vehicles to others and then purchase new vehicles to profit from speculative buying and selling. These unscrupulous merchants already own a large number of vehicles and are seeking to manufacture new vehicles to monopolize the market and exploit the coolies. This dangerous intention not only contradicts the original intention of the Municipal Government to empathize with the poor, but will also have a great impact on vehicle merchants and drivers. The measures for increasing the number of vehicles by the Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus stipulate that the registered vehicles should be reviewed. The association submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, requesting a careful review of the applications and a precise and detailed investigation to prevent unscrupulous merchants from deceiving the authorities and to fulfill the original intention of helping the poor and maintaining the livelihoods of vehicle merchants and drivers. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has determined that the measures for increasing the number of operating human-powered vehicles in the Chinese area have been announced by the Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus, and all those engaged in the human-powered vehicle business should comply with them. The association believes that the intention of increasing the number of vehicles this time is not from the general coolie drivers, but rather speculative means by vehicle vendors to monopolize the market, and requests a precise investigation during the legal review to avoid deception by unscrupulous merchants. The matter is legitimate and should be submitted to the Municipal Government for review. The Municipal Bureau is requested to investigate and conduct a careful review to ensure fairness and benefit the public.</p>

<p>Kidnapper Leader Shi Arong Detained</p>
<p>Various Kidnappers Describe the Situation at the Time</p>
<p>Arong Cunningly Denies, Claiming He is Being Falsely Accused</p>
<p>Qu Chengqing, a Shanghai resident living at No. 1760 Hainin Road, was kidnapped in January of last year. A ransom of 100,000 gold pieces was demanded. Subsequently, the Wayside Police rescued Qu from the bandit's lair and captured eight kidnappers. After a thorough investigation by the Special District Court, they were convicted. Zhang Zhangji and Wang Qinen were both sentenced to death, but the sentences have not yet been carried out. The remaining six bandits, including He Qingen, were given various prison terms. However, the ringleader of the gang, identified by the bandits as Yong native Shi Arong, had fled and his whereabouts were unknown, making it impossible to arrest him. He was finally apprehended by detectives at No. 339 Tangshan Road the other day. Yesterday morning, he was brought before Judge Feng at the Special Court for questioning. The police also brought in other accomplices from the West Prison to testify. However, Qu Chengqing's residence has since been moved, making it impossible to summon him to court. According to Wang Yuqing's testimony, he first met Shi Arong in October of the year before last. After kidnapping Qu, they hid him in Shi's house in Runde Lane, Gongping Road. The ransom letters were also written at Shi's direction. Wang Afu testified that the defendant, Shi Arong, and the fugitive Bao Laoer and others kidnapped Qu on Hainin Road and put him in a car driven by Laoer to Shi's house, where he was hidden upstairs. He was given a gun and told to guard him. Zhang Zhangzhang testified that he was Bao Laoer's apprentice and was told by Bao and Shi to help on Hainin Road. Shen Adi also testified that he helped guard the hostage upstairs in Shi's house. When he tried to escape, he was slapped by Shi. Wang Qinen testified that Bao was his master and Shi was his master's younger brother. He was invited to help kidnap Qu and was later ordered to guard the hostage. Gui Kangsong also testified that he guarded the hostage in Shi's house. When questioned, Shi Arong claimed to have previously worked as an assistant for Detective Wu and vehemently denied any involvement in the kidnapping. He claimed that the statements of the other criminals were all false accusations. Judge Feng then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and Wang Yuqing and the others to be returned to prison for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>Abandoned After Marriage</p>
<p>What Are Sun Runwang's Intentions?</p>
<p>Accused of Abandonment and Bigamy</p>
<p>Song Yusheng, a Fengxian native, recently retained a lawyer to file a complaint with the Special District Court, accusing Sun Runwang of bigamy and abandonment. The complaint stated, "For the crime of bigamy and abandonment, punish according to law. The complainant's own daughter, Guiyu, is now eighteen years old. When she was young, she was betrothed to a Tuo family in the same village. In the eighteenth year of the Republic, the defendant used trickery to entice Guiyu, who was only sixteen years old at the time. Because she was honest and simple-minded, and had little knowledge, she was seduced by him. The defendant committed the crime of enticing a minor. He then encouraged Guiyu to break off the engagement with the Tuo family, promising to marry her as his principal wife and never marry another woman. He also instructed Guiyu to communicate with the complainant. In September of the nineteenth year, the Fengxian County Court ruled to dissolve the engagement with the Tuo family. In October, he invited Mr. Lu and Mr. Jiang to introduce them and formally married her at the Fanwang Palace. In November, he suddenly made an excuse to return to his hometown and disappeared without a trace. After repeated inquiries, it was learned that he had married Xia Ziyu in his hometown on the fifth day of November. Guiyu is a young and weak woman with no ability to save herself and has been abandoned. The crimes of bigamy and abandonment have both occurred. A request is made for alimony of 50,000 yuan."</p>

<p>Xu Huiying, a thirty-year-old woman from Baoshan, has retained lawyer Fan Gang to file a complaint with the Special Court because her husband, Zhang Ziqin, abandoned her for his concubine and failed to provide for her. She is requesting a divorce. The original complaint stated, "For the abandonment of a wife for a concubine and failure to provide for her, request a divorce. The plaintiff lost her mother at a young age and was married to the defendant in the ninth year of the Republic by her father's order. They lived together for less than a month before the defendant went to work at the Fudian Bank in Hong Kong. In the twelfth year, he came to Shanghai because of his aunt's death, but returned to Hong Kong in less than two months. In the fourteenth year, he returned to Shanghai once again and pawned all of the plaintiff's clothing and jewelry. He also took out a photo and showed it, saying that he had married a concubine. Since then, there has been no news. Since the establishment of the marital relationship with the defendant, more than ten years have passed, but they have only lived together for a few months and have never been provided for. Such abandonment of a wife is difficult to endure together. Please grant a divorce."</p>

Five or six hundred bags of flour on board fell into the river. Afterwards, Jin reported the incident to the Water Police Station, seeking compensation from the steamer company for the losses.</p>

<p>Recounts the Details of Embezzlement</p>
<p>Summarizing What He Said, He Was Burdened by His Younger Brother</p>
<p>Younger Brother Also Imprisoned for Another Case</p>
<p>After Giving a Detailed Account, He Collapses</p>
<p>The Court Orders Sentencing Next Wednesday</p>
<p>Chen Mutao of Jiahe has been working at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for fourteen years, rising to the important position of Deputy Director of the Savings Department. Recently, he successively embezzled 64,000 yuan from savings deposits. Deeply worried that the matter would be exposed in the future, making it difficult to escape serious punishment, he left a letter and fled on the first day of this month, going alone to Wusong.</p>
<p>Hoping to Drown Himself in the Sea Late at Night, He Was Unexpectedly Stopped by the Iron Railing by the Riverbank</p>
<p>Unable to Pass, He Fell to the Ground. The Sleeping Pills He Took Took Effect, Causing Him to Faint. He Was Discovered by Someone, Who Carried Him to the Shanghai Public Hospital. The Police, Upon Receiving a Complaint from the Bank Regarding Embezzlement, Sent a Detective to Transfer Chen to the Labour Bureau Hospital for Treatment. After Recovery, He Was Taken to the Special District Court. The Interrogation Had Already Been Reported by This Newspaper. Yesterday Morning, Presiding Judge Xu Jiashi Continued the Trial in the First Court. The Police Lawyer, Ru Bao-I,</p>
<p>Repeated the Case Once Again. The Zhejiang</p>
<p>Industrial Bank Retained Lawyer Wu Shou-Gong to Clearly State That in Addition to the Public Prosecution by the Police, Zhejiang Industry Must Also File a Civil Suit, Requesting a Judgment Ordering the Repayment of the Embezzled Funds. The Defendant Retained Lawyer Jiang Bao-Lian to Defend Him. Subsequently, Chen Xuanzhen, Manager of the Bank, Appeared in Court and Stated, That Chen Mutao Had Been Working for Ten Years, Extremely Honest and Capable. The Savings Department Was Organized With a Director, Deputy Director, and Three Team Leaders. Chen Was</p>
<p>The Head of the Three Team Leaders. The Team Leader Was</p>
<p>The Head of One Group, In Charge of The Receipt and Payment of Funds. When the Deputy Director Was Unable to Serve for Any Reason, Chen Would Take His Place. Chen Began to Use His Position as Acting Deputy Director to Embezzle Funds Since Autumn of the Eighteenth Year. The Amount He Has Been Found to Have Embezzled Is 64,000 Yuan. Whether There Were Other Malpractices Is Yet to Be Discovered. The Reason Why This Was Discovered Now Is Because Chen Was Officially Promoted to Deputy Director and Took Office on March 1. He Realized That the Embezzled Accounts Would Be Exposed at the End of the Month, So He Fled on April 1. However, We Initially Did Not Know About The Embezzlement Until</p>
<p>He Was Rescued After Attempting Suicide by Poison in Wusong</p>
<p>. The Police Searched Him and Found a Letter, Which Revealed The Truth. He Presented The Account Books To The Court and Asked It To Investigate. At This Time, The Defendant, Chen Mutao, Requested The Judge To Allow Him to Recount the Details of The Misappropriation and All of His Hardships. Judge Xu Granted The Request. Chen Then Began to Describe The Situation, Saying That He Had Studied Poetry and Had Some Knowledge of Propriety. His Beloved Mother Passed Away When He Was Seventeen Years Old. Before Her Death, She Repeatedly</p>
<p>Instructed Him to Protect and Care For His Younger Brother. He Did Not Dare To Forget This.</p>
<p>Therefore, This Matter Was Due to Caring for His Younger Brother. He Was Introduced to The Xinhua Bank By Friends and Relatives When He Was Nineteen Years Old. He Soon Became Ill and Resigned. He Was Introduced to The Zhejiang Industrial Bank When He Was Twenty Years Old and Has Been Working There Ever Since. He Has Been There for Fourteen Years. He Knew That He Had Always Been Diligent and Harmonious With His Colleagues and Servants. He Was Greatly Affected by The Student Protests in The Past. He Also Liked to Read Novels, Especially "Romance of The Three Kingdoms."</p>
<p>He Admired Liu, Guan, and Zhang The Most. Over Time, He Was Subconsciously</p>
<p>Influenced By The Heroes in The Novel. Therefore, He Tried His Best to Help Anyone Who Asked For Help. Even If He Could Not Afford It, He Would Find a Way to Help. In the Eighteenth Year, My Younger Brother, Cici,</p>
<p>Opened Jinkang Foreign Goods Company in My Father's Name. He Managed it Poorly and Made Friends With Bad Company. As a Result, He Often Went to Gambling Dens Day and Night. He Lost A Lot of Money. He Would Come To Me and Say That He Needed Money to Order Goods and Ask Me to Temporarily Advance Him The Funds. I Did Not Know That He Was Spending It On Gambling, So I Repeatedly Helped Him, Resulting In</p>
<p>A Total Advance of More Than 10,000 Gold. When Jinkang Closed</p>
<p>, Creditors Pressured Him. I Again Repaid More Than 10,000 Yuan of Debt. In Addition, I Helped Countless Numbers of My Younger Brother's Gambling Friends. I Spent So Much That I Could Not Afford It. In June of Last Year, My Younger Brother's Creditor, Huacheng Silk Store, Sent a Mr. Yu To The Bank At Night To Lure Me Away, Saying That If I Wanted To Prevent My Younger Brother From Being Sued, I Should Quickly Pay Off The Debt.</p>
<p>I Repaid Thousands of Yuan and Urged My Younger Brother to Behave Himself in The Future. However, Loyalty Is Hard to Hear. In the Last Quarter of Last Year, My Younger Brother Forged Zhuang Notes. He Was Reported and Punished By The Court. He Is Still In Prison. When the Case Occurred, I Hired a Lawyer to Defend My Younger Brother. The Expenses Were All Paid By Me. By The End of the Year, I Had Embezzled 40,000 Yuan From The Bank and 17,700 Taels of Silver. Although I Wanted to Make Amends,</p>
<p>I Had No Way to Do So.</p>
<p>I Had No Way Out But Suicide to Avoid Hurting the Guarantors and Damaging My Family's Reputation. So, On April 1, I Sneaked to Wusong and Wrote My Last Letter in a Hotel Room. I Coughed Up Several Mouthfuls of Blood at The Time. I Planned to Drown Myself in The Sea At Night. Because I Had Studied a Lot, I Tied a Lot of Books To My Body, Hoping That The Heavy Books Would Prevent The Body From Floating To The Surface After Entering The Sea. Late at Night, I Dissolved and Swallowed Two Bottles of Sleeping Pills. Then, I Walked Out of The Hotel. Unexpectedly, There Was an Iron Fence Outside The Hotel Door, Which I Could Not Cross. I Returned to The Room and Worshipped, Bidding Farewell to My Relatives and Friends. At This Time, The Medicine Had Taken Effect. I Do Not Know What Happened Afterwards Because I Was Unconscious. Now That I Am Alive Again, I Have No Other Request Than to Ask Judge and Chen Xuanzhen, Manager, to Specifically Forgive</p>
<p>Me For My Criminal Acts.</p>
<p>At This Point, He Collapsed, Unable to Speak. Judge Xu Waited For Him to Finish and Ordered Him to Open the Debate. The Police and the Bank's Lawyer Both Asked That He Be Punished According to Law, While Jiang Baolian Stated That the Defendant's Family and Guarantors Were Trying to Raise Funds to Repay the Money, Requesting Lenience. The Judge Then Ordered the Defendant to Be Taken Back to Prison and Set the Sentencing for Next Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Corpse Lay for Three Days and Nights Before Being Buried</p>
<p>After Burial, Thieves Stole the Coffin</p>
<p>Chen Lao Jiu (aka Jinfa), a farmer from the Zhang Family House Oil Mill at the East End of Shengjia Lane, Tangqiao, Pudong, because his newlywed wife, Hua, was used to certain habits and returned to her mother's house to live for two months. Chen repeatedly went to welcome her back to Ning, but his mother-in-law refused to let her go. Lao Jiu was angry and swallowed a piece of red arsenic in secret on the eleventh of this month, committing suicide. By 7:00 AM the next day, he died from the poison. Upon learning of this, the mother-in-law still did not send her daughter back to wear mourning clothes, but instead demanded compensation for dowry gold jewelry from the groom's family, which caused the Chen clan to be dissatisfied and go to question her. The bride had hidden the gold jewelry in the bag of a neighbor's daughter and it was discovered, causing a commotion and dispute. The details were reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that this case was mediated by friends and relatives from both sides, who blamed the Hua family for being wrong, ordering them to send their daughter back to the Chen family immediately to wear mourning clothes and observe her widowhood, thus settling the matter. The Chen family was poor, owing a lot of money since the engagement and marriage, with no savings. There was no money for the coffin and burial expenses. Therefore, the maternal family gave a discretionary subsidy. The corpse lay for three days and nights before being buried at 7:00 PM the day before yesterday (the fourteenth). That night, the corpse and coffin were carried to the field at the east end of the Zhang Family House for temporary burial. Unexpectedly, something unexpected happened. Chen's corpse coffin was pried open by thieves that night (commonly known as "upside-down fighting"), and all the burial clothes were stolen. Yesterday morning, a vegetable vendor noticed it on the way and the news spread, and the crowd of onlookers blocked the road. In the afternoon, the corpse's family brought Chen's old clothes to cover it, and the coffin lid was nailed on. The onlookers dispersed, saying that Chen Lao Jiu died really bitterly.</p>

<p>With a Giant Rock Weighing Dozens of Pounds on Its Back</p>
<p>Amazingly Able to Float, Truly an Unusual Phenomenon</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a murdered male corpse floated up in the Suzhou Creek in front of the Yutong Flour Mill at Chedaijiao, Guangfu Road, North Gate. He was about twenty years old, wearing a yellow suit, an evergreen coat, white socks, and had a bald head. His hands and feet were tied with ropes, and there was a rope around his neck, with deep strangulation marks. His head was also stabbed in several places. Strangely, a giant rock weighing dozens of pounds was tied to his back, a situation commonly known as "planting lotus flowers." After killing the person, they were weighed down to the bottom of the river with a giant rock, surely ensuring that their bones and flesh would rot away and not be seen by anyone, so that the dead would become wronged souls without a chance to be redressed. This type of method is often found among boatmen who commit theft and evil deeds. However, it is truly an unusual phenomenon that this corpse, with a giant rock on its back, still floated up. At that time, after the Water Patrol Team rescued him, they sent Shen Xiaohe, the local security officer of the 27th Bao, 11th Tu, to</p>

His financial situation is prosperous, which has attracted the attention of bandits. At approximately 10:15 AM yesterday morning, Zheng and his wife were upstairs. Not long after getting up, after having breakfast, Zheng was planning to go out on business. The rickshaw puller and servants were chatting downstairs when they suddenly heard a knock on the door. The rickshaw puller went out to open the door and welcome the visitor in. The visitor reached into his pocket as if searching for something. The rickshaw puller initially thought he was taking out a business card, but suddenly the visitor pulled out a pistol and pointed it directly at his chest. Only then did he realize that it was a bandit. Six bandits quickly followed him in, four with pistols and two with Mauser pistols. One was wearing a blue lined spring jacket and pants, while the others were wearing long robes and copper basin hats. They entered the living room in single file, first inspecting the surroundings. One bandit guarded the telephone on the wall and asked if there was an alarm bell. Five bandits then went upstairs and broke into Zheng's bedroom. Zheng, seeing this, knew they were not good people. He intended to resist, but he did not have his own pistol with him that day. He was helpless. The bandits showed their weapons and demanded, "Behave yourself and hand over the keys!" Zheng, intimidated by their power, had no choice but to obey. After obtaining the keys, the bandits drove Zheng and his wife downstairs and locked them in the living room. The five bandits ransacked the cabinets and drawers, searching at will. After an hour, they left after their plunder. Zheng, seeing that the bandits had left, went upstairs to check the missing items. The stolen items included 1,400 yuan in cash, a diamond ring worth over 1,000 yuan, a pearl Ruyi and a string of pearls worth approximately 500-600 yuan, a gold wooden fish, a gold lock pendant, two pairs of gold buttons, two pairs of large and small gold bracelets, a satin lined coat, a black purple lambskin robe, a camel's wool robe, and a crepe cotton robe, totaling approximately 4,000 yuan. He filed a report with the relevant First Precinct of the Fourth District. Police Chief Dai immediately ordered the patrol captain to investigate the scene and instructed his subordinates to strictly arrest and prosecute the perpetrators.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily, since Sunday afternoon, French detectives seized a bag of opium from a car used by the post office at the Taikoo Wharf. The local postmaster has sent Qiu Weilai, a Westerner in charge of joint transportation of mail, to Beijing on the 13th to investigate the details of the Wusong ship. According to the postmaster, it is now found that the No. 14 mail truck did pass through the French Concession Pudong at that time, but there is no evidence to prove whether the truck was involved in the case. Qiu Weilai's investigation report concluded that the post office was not involved in the case because no witness was arrested, the owner of the car is unknown, and the bag containing the opium was not a post office bag. According to Deputy Inspector Li of the French Police Station, there is no evidence to prove that the car involved in the case was a post office vehicle. It is suspected that the car was impersonating a post office vehicle to avoid inspection by detectives.</p>

<p>Bans Songyang Telephone Company From Raising Prices</p>
<p>The Wusong Songyang Telephone Company recently issued a notice stating that starting in April, the telephone fee for Type A users would be increased by half a yuan, and the telephone fee for Type B and C users would be increased by one yuan. Upon receiving the report, the Municipal Public Works Bureau stated that according to the Regulations on the Supervision of Private Public Utilities, the establishment or amendment of public utility fee collection methods related to public users should be reported to the supervisory authority for approval and record. The company increased the telephone fees for users without approval, which is inappropriate. It is said that the company has been ordered to publish an announcement and notify the cancellation of the fee increase.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Nanyang China on Longhua Road invited Master Taixu to lecture on Buddhism. The topic was "Buddhism and New Thought." He compared Russell's New Realism, Einstein's Theory of Relativity, and the latest Atomic Theory with Buddhism, stating that although there were many similarities, the subtlety, depth, and shallowness were vastly different. He also mentioned that vegetarianism and abstaining from killing animals are very popular in Europe and the United States. He witnessed this situation during his travels and examined the reasons. One reason is that meat contains toxins, which are harmful to hygiene. Another reason is that animals eating animals goes against humanity. Westerners deduce it from reason, believing that humans evolved from beasts, so the habit of eating meat has been passed down to this day and not forgotten. There were seven or eight hundred listeners that day, applauding and welcoming him enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Both Ren and Chen are Sentenced to Fines</p>
<p>Original Bail Maintained During Appeal Period</p>
<p>Regarding the "Silent Love" film, Wu Airong’s stepmother, Madam Wu Yang, and her brother Wu Baolun, believed the film insulted their character. They filed a private lawsuit in the District Court against Ren Xifan, manager of the Xifan Film Company, director Chen Zhuomin, cinematographer Zhang Fukang, and Liang Zhongfen of the Current Affairs Film Company, accusing them of insult and defamation. The Criminal Division of the District Court conducted multiple investigations and summoned Lin Jim and Wu Airong, the original subjects of the film, for questioning. The plaintiff further requested an additional civil lawsuit for 3,000 taels in damages to reputation. After deliberation, the court found that the actions in the film, done without the permission of the individuals involved, inevitably defamed the reputation of others. Therefore, yesterday, Judge Qian Chengjun opened the court and declared Ren Xifan guilty of defamation and fined him 400 yuan, Chen Zhuomin guilty of defamation and fined him 200 yuan. Zhang Fukang was found not guilty, and Liang Zhongfen's trial was suspended. The civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Division. The defendants declared their dissatisfaction, and the court ordered that the original bail be maintained during the appeal period. Consequently, the defendants were released on bail by their guarantors.</p>

<h3 id="e80">News from Trade Associations <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Brick and Ash Industry Trade Association held its first general membership meeting yesterday, chaired by Hu Qingchen. After reporting on the association's affairs, the following cases were discussed: (1) A letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce soliciting donations for disaster relief in Shaanxi Province. It was resolved to allocate the remaining funds from the association's welfare fund for this purpose, and that all fellow tradesmen should make every effort to donate, so as to gather strength from many sources. (2) The procedures for the Municipal Market's preparation are not yet complete, and how should it proceed? It was resolved that since the procedures for the Municipal Market's preparation are not yet complete, its establishment should be temporarily postponed. (3) A letter from the Coal Ash Factory regarding the price increase of coal ash. It was resolved that coal kiln operators are using the excuse of a shortage of Kailuan coal dust to drastically increase the market price of coal ash to five jiao per dan, which calculates to 2.35 yuan per load. According to all calculation methods and proportions, the increase should not be so large, which is clearly monopolistic speculation seeking exorbitant profits, disregarding our industry and indirectly bringing the construction industry of the entire city of Shanghai to a virtual standstill, which is extremely abhorrent. This association should send a letter uniformly rejecting this, and find ways to seek our own relief. At this point, Representative Zhu of the Municipal Party Headquarters said that freedom of business is enshrined in the Three Principles of the People. If the other party is taking the opportunity to speculate, we can obtain supplies directly from the production area. If obstacles arise, the law will provide protection. The attending representatives unanimously agreed to raise funds to establish an office for purchasing coal ash and implementing transportation and sales. Thirteen specialized committee members were immediately elected to purchase coal ash: Hu Qingya, Chen Jichang, Zhu Hongqi, Ling Shumei, Gu Hongxiang, Jia Shaoyan, Xu Menghua, Gong Binsheng, Zhou Gui, Zhang Songxian, Li Weixin, Wu Hongchang, and Wu Mengsheng, etc. The coal ash purchasing office was established within the association on the same day. (4) The issue of contracts between fellow tradesmen and ash kilns. It was resolved that since coal ash prices have skyrocketed and negotiations are already underway, it should be discussed after the coal ash issue is resolved. There is no question of signing contracts at present. (5) Member Sheng Xingpanhua reported that the self-transport of coal ash was unreasonably detained, requesting protection. It was resolved that it should be unanimously approved and protected. (6) The location of this association's headquarters is remote and not very suitable. Should a branch office be established in the concession? It was resolved to agree and establish a branch office at No. 275 Huile Lane, Yunnan Road, in the Public Concession. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>The Shanghai eyewear industry giants, Zhuang Honggao, Dong Zixing, Zhang Shide, Wang Shuoquan, Wang Wende, Yin Zaiqing, Yu Zhimin, Chu Zimin, Bao Ziyuan, Yan Kanghou, Fan Jiating, Xue Hesun, Li Chaifeng, Wu Zhusun, Jia Songting, etc., previously believed that the old Chinese Eyewear Association's organization was not in accordance with the law. They specially presented a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters for permission to reorganize it into the Shanghai Municipal Eyewear Industry Trade Association to comply with the law. However, some members of the trade do not understand the truth of the reorganization and are still observing and hesitating to join. It is reported that the association issued a letter to those who have not yet joined. A excerpt is as follows: "To our esteemed colleagues: The way of doing business values competition, but even more so, unity. If there is only competition without unity, it will inevitably lead to failure. This is why all industries have trade associations. On the government side, it is hoped that all industries and businesses have sufficient unity to revitalize commerce and recover rights and interests. The Law on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations was specially promulgated to bring businessmen into the correct path, aiming for the prosperity of commerce. It also stipulates that each industry association has the qualifications of members in the General Chamber of Commerce, and has the right to make suggestions and supervise. In law, it is a legal group, with the right to elect and be elected. The legislation is perfect, and the plan is thorough. However, at this time of initiating business tax, official procedures are cumbersome, and the burden on businessmen increases. The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce advocates that matters relating to business tax be handled by the Chamber of Commerce, and has petitioned the Ministry of Finance. It is bound to be implemented. The Shanghai Municipal Business Tax has also been proposed by the Tax Rules Research Association to be first recognized by the authorities by each industry association, and then apportioned according to the actual business situation. Matters are made public, and the tax is only minimal, avoiding the official form of harassment and reducing the invisible burden on businessmen. It is found that each industry in Shanghai has a strict organization, but our eyewear industry is very scattered. At this time of close and vital interests, without sufficient unity, not only will the loss in business tax be very large, but it will also decline from now on, and be scorned by various industries. This association is deeply concerned about this. We convened a meeting to discuss and unanimously decided to notify the colleagues to join the association quickly and unite our strength. Do not give up the inherent rights and legal protection. If there are any difficult incidents, this association has hired a year-round legal advisor, who will not find it difficult to resolve them. It is also planned to set up an Optometry Research Association in this association, hiring specialized knowledge, specializing in research, and striving to promote our industry, so that it will develop more and more, and receive the effect of a thousand benefits without a single disadvantage. Certificates will also be printed and filled out at any time to serve as a pledge of faith. We specially send this letter to you and ask your company to join immediately and jointly promote the progress. The future of the association is deeply reliant on it. A membership application form is attached, please fill it out and reply. I wish you good fortune."</p>

<p>This Letter</p>
<p>To the esteemed chief editor: I recently read your newspaper's 15th issue about the kidnapping of Qian Zhaofu last night. After investigation, Zhaofu is not the owner of our store, but an employee of our firm. Because his father, the manager of the store, is over sixty years old, he asked him to temporarily handle business negotiations. Although he has a small share, his monthly income is only enough to support himself. Because the facts are inconsistent, I am writing to ask your chief editor to make corrections. With best wishes, Yongfeng Timber Company. Correspondence address: Nan Shi Nan Wharf, April 15th, Lunar Calendar.</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: According to a report from the instructor of the middle school department of our school, student Ma Qiwen suddenly had suicidal thoughts at noon on the 14th of this month. After being detected, he was immediately rescued and is now safe. We have also tried to enlighten him in many ways, and it is not for the reasons speculated in the report. We hope your newspaper will make a correction. Sincerely, General Affairs Office of National Labor University, April 15th.</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, In yesterday's local news column of your newspaper, the section regarding the false attachment of the Chinese-Western Pharmacy and the Hot Springs Bathhouse is inconsistent with the facts. Qian was not present at the Chinese Society luncheon the other day, and although Zhao Bang attended, there was no meeting. Also, attorney Eson was not present. Qian and others did not participate in how the Hot Springs Bathhouse attendant contacted the creditor. Accordingly, we request that your newspaper make corrections immediately. To the Shen Bao, Accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang, April 15th.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Anecdotes of Mr. Fu Junjian <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Er</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Fu Junjian suddenly passed away. Many people in Hunan mourned him. After welcoming his coffin back, the government held a public memorial service and requested a commendation from the provincial government, in consideration of the death of the old poet Zeng Chongbo, who lived in splendor but died in desolation. It is truly another wave of emotion. Here are one or two things written to express my lingering sadness and sighing for the past.</p>
<p>Mr. Fu's courtesy name was Tun Gen, from Liling. He was born with intelligence and was considered a child prodigy. He was skilled in poetry and prose, not conforming to vulgar tunes, and good at finger calligraphy, strong and vigorous, not casually written, not easily obtained. In the thirteenth year of the Republic, I worked with him in a certain school. One day, he recited a quatrain to me, saying, "I have not seen Tan San for half a year, his fame and fortune are known to be in the ascendant. How about a short flute across the back of a cow, quiet valleys and clear streams are enough to sleep." Asked what he thought of the poem, I thought Mr. Fu's poem was great and praised it greatly. He said that one must have joy with Tan Gong like Mr. Fu to write the words Tan San, and one must be as noble as Mr. Fu to have the words quiet valleys and clear streams. Mr. Fu said, "This was written by a new noble in our village before he came out of the mountains." Everyone thinks it is my poem when I recite it to others, so we laughed together for a long time.</p>
<p>Another day after class, my colleagues and I were chatting in the lounge. Mr. Fu suddenly arrived, laughing and shouting, "I've been burned by fire, I've been burned by fire!" Everyone was startled and asked about the situation. Then he smiled and said, "The wildfire burned me, it doesn't matter." He took out a roll of newspapers from his bag. Everyone looked at it. It was the Wildfire supplement of the Xiang Bao, written by Mr. Wang Fuquan and Zhang Tiemin. The purpose was to advocate vernacular literature and attack classical literature. The target was Mr. Fu as a poet of the Southern Society and a classical writer, and Mr. Wu Fangji as a eight-legged essay teacher. (Wu was also working at a certain school at that time) The spears were aimed at him from all sides, strong and unparalleled. Mr. Fu said that there is no such thing as literary language in literature, the key is to seek truth. I have always held this view, but they only attack me with poetry and classical writing, regarding me as stubborn and old-fashioned, which is not accurate. However, the friends in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River (as the Wildfire people called themselves) are known to be slippery, daring to fight hard with the barbarians of Hunan, not afraid of getting burned, their courage is also great. After speaking, he laughed loudly, and everyone laughed. Later, government officials suspected that Wildfire had incited student unrest, and hinted that the Xiang Bao should stop publishing. The Wildfire people thought it was at Mr. Fu's instruction, but they did not see Mr. Fu's breadth of mind.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Witty Remarks <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>My teacher, Mr. Fan Jingmei, has been known in the business world for many years for his diligent and capable work. Mr. Fan was busy with work until last spring, at the age of forty-three, when he held his wedding ceremony. Knowing good things were coming to his door, many wished him to have a son soon. This spring, he did indeed have a son. When holding the birth celebration, relatives and friends congratulated Mr. Fan on obtaining this beautiful son in the shortest period of time, which shows that no matter what he does, he has a considerable grasp of it. Everyone raised their glasses to congratulate him. Mr. Fan smiled and said that he "stumbled upon" it. There was no so-called certainty. Everyone laughed loudly. According to the Shanghai dialect, "stumbling upon" means accidental. (Received payment)</p>

<p>Z&gt; Bingxin</p>
<p>Between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there is a large town. The population is dense, and the commerce is prosperous. At the turn of February and March of this year, the newly prevalent meningitis epidemic spread to the town, extending to the surrounding villages. The villagers and townspeople usually have god-welcoming celebrations in the spring. Later, due to the government's decrees of the Republic to eliminate superstition, the authorities strictly banned it, and this custom was slightly reduced. This year, the people were again bewitched by the saying that the plague god could ward off the plague. They raised funds and scheduled to parade the plague god through the town. The sub-district chief of the local public security bureau of the township heard the news and immediately issued a notice, clarifying the ban and earnestly advising that there were good methods for epidemic prevention, and that clay figures had no power to remedy. However, the ignorant people were obsessed and did not realize the truth, and the progress became more vigorous. The sub-district chief, with the meeting date approaching, was deeply concerned that it would be a waste of people and money, and easily cause trouble, so he took urgent measures to carry the plague god idol to the sub-district office, lock it in an empty room, and apply to the superior official to send police to supervise and suppress it. However, the people gathered men, women, old and young three days before the meeting date, each holding incense, surrounding the sub-district office, shouting and petitioning, declaring that if they could not get it back, they would burn the sub-district office or forcibly seize the idol. At the time of the event, the situation was turbulent. The armed police sent by the superior numbered only four, combined with the local sub-district police, their number was less than two percent of the population. The sub-district chief was about to send the police to break through and rush to ask the superior official to send additional police to coordinate the suppression when his mother heard about it and scolded, "The situation is urgent! You want to make this place follow in the footsteps of Dongyang County!" Moreover, the people's crime is only superstition, and it is not to the point of death. Are you going to treat them like whales and sharks? And there is no reason to send troops to suppress them. The sub-district chief said, "That's true. But violating the decree will likely lead to dismissal." The mother said, "Haha! If the villages and towns are ruined, can you alone protect yourself?" "Then what should I do?" The mother said, "Return the idol, warn them not to cause trouble, and send police to accompany the meeting on the meeting date for strict protection, then the people will be happy. If the epidemic does not stop afterward, the people will be disappointed and realize the truth. Even if it doesn't, you can avoid burning everything. Do it quickly! You can't delay it for a moment!" The sub-district chief obeyed. The crowd was appeased. On the day of welcoming the god, the sub-district police armed with protection were fortunate that nothing happened. Afterward, the superior officials appreciated his feelings and did not blame him. The sub-district chief was very happy and thanked his mother. The mother said, "You can go. The government is not smooth, and the people are not harmonious. A pro-people official is beyond your capabilities." The sub-district chief resigned and left with his mother. How wise is the mother! To call it expedient and adaptable, who says it is not appropriate. As for the so-called plague god, with a mud body and a porcelain head, it is said that two hundred years ago, a kiln owner burned a kiln for seven days and seven nights. When the kiln was opened, there was nothing but a porcelain head, like the plague god's shape. So he assembled a mud body and served it carefully. Is it a fact? Is it a fabrication? It is unknowable and unnecessary to study. The names of the sub-district chief and his mother were not mentioned by the informer, so I omit them.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Recording Min Cuiying's Sitting in the Palace <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Wen</p>
<p>Ms. Min Cuiying is the daughter of Mr. Xin Wu, a large merchant from eastern Zhejiang. She was educated at home from an early age and is naturally intelligent. She has a foundation in both Chinese and Western languages and is passionate about art. She learned charcoal painting. In just a few days, she could achieve a lifelike resemblance. Her extraordinary intelligence is like this. She is particularly interested in Peking opera. She learned the female roles, but without a particular school. She can gather the strengths of each school to form her own style. She has a strong desire to reform Peking opera. She once performed a revised version of "Su San's Release" with Shanghai people at the New Oriental Theater. She became famous at once and had the reputation of an artist. Yesterday, she was invited by the Pingshe amateur troupe to perform "Visiting Mother in the Palace" at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Ms. Min left behind the Iron Mirror Princess, looking beautiful. The dignified and graceful were expressed in the beautiful and elegant. At the entrance, the opening line of the Yao board "The sun is shining, the spring is beautiful, and the birds are singing" requires a small tune. The ultimate effect is extremely euphemistic and roundabout. The three "He He Shi Le" in the slow board are accompanied by different facial expressions. She can express the thoughts of a woman's family. A person without wisdom will never understand this. The entire slow board song is like jade, round and smooth. The pace is moderate. The highlights in the allegro are repeatedly seen. Especially the two lines "Thinking of home, thinking of flesh and blood, I can't be reunited" and "What heartfelt things do you want to say in detail" are appropriately modulated. The most moving. As for the clarity of the Beijing dialect and the formal style of the figure, they are secondary matters.</p>

<p>— Xia Hu</p>
<p>Lu Zongfu, the county magistrate of Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, whose courtesy name is Boxiong, is a graduate of Peking University and has a close relationship with me. Lu's wife is the younger sister of Ye Yuhu, a virtuous internal assistant. He first served as an official in Jiang County, Shanxi, etc., and was transferred to Jincheng not long ago. He has a good reputation wherever he goes. His father, Mr. Tijun, is a well-known filial and incorrupt official, with the title of "Good Old Man." His younger brother, Mengsheng, graduated from Jiaotong University and specializes in electrical engineering. He recently served as the director of a wireless station in Shanghai. Last year, when Yan Feng rebelled, the Shanxi army frequently requisitioned, and Jincheng was right in the middle of it. Fortunately, Magistrate Lu took appropriate measures, and the place was safe. Therefore, the people greatly appreciated him. At the beginning of February of this year, Shanghai newspapers suddenly published the news that the county magistrate of Jincheng had been shot and killed by Sun Dianying's troops. Lu's old father was uneasy after reading the newspaper. It happened to be New Year's Eve according to the old calendar, and the whole family was gloomy. After a telegram from the Shanxi County Government, the truth was revealed. My friend Zhu Qingyuan, a classmate of Lu, in order to comfort Lu's relatives and friends, published an article in the Aixkees Optical three-day journal that he runs, which was extremely detailed. Lu's parents, thinking of their son being a petty official thousands of miles away, repeatedly telegraphed him to return. Lu also had the thoughts of a wanderer missing his parents and resolutely resigned, but as soon as his resignation was submitted, the people of Jincheng actually blocked the road and cried to keep him. Only after Lu agreed to withdraw his resignation did they cheer and disperse. "A good official is still a scholar." Magistrate Lu can be worthy of it. My ancestor, Lan Gao, was an official in Boluo County, Guangdong, and also had political achievements. On the day of his departure, the villagers all sent him off with tears. To this day, there is still a monument to my ancestor's departure in Boluo. Since the Republic of China, Wang Renpu and Fei Zuoquan, two county magistrates of our salt county, also had the benevolence of Gan Tang and Shao Fu. Wang was meritorious in treating rice borers, and the villagers still praised him. Wang was good at calligraphy and painting, and his other name was Chun Daoren. Therefore, I also write it down to encourage those who are now local officials.</p>

The Yu family rebuilt it, reducing it to seven stories. There is also a stone pagoda in the middle, fully carved with Buddha statues. On August 18th of the 17th year of the Republic, due to years of disrepair, the top collapsed with a roar. In the old days, the pagoda could be climbed to enjoy the distant view. Today, the pagoda door has been closed to avoid danger. There are also many birds on it, often vying and clamoring. A little east, it is</p>

There is a stele with Wang Bo's writing of the "Record of Shakyamuni's Enlightenment." After the visit, I strolled back to Sishi Chun for dinner and entertained the local press, the orphanage director, the scout leader, and the security chief, etc. I returned to my residence and went to bed. It was already 10:45.</p>
<p>The fourth day. Waking up from a dream at 5:00, I hurriedly got dressed. It was 5:30. After breakfast, I boarded the scheduled motorboat. The boat carried two civilian boats. Besides our group, there were also 30 scouts participating. The local business community, fearing accidents due to the long journey, specially sent 12 militiamen to accompany and protect us. At 7:25, the boat set sail, heading straight for Jin Gai Mountain. Before long, we passed</p>

There is Chunyang Palace above, the old site of the Plum Blossom Temple, so many plum trees are planted outside the hall. There are also the ancient sites of Lu Tan and Zhuquan, etc. There is Chunyang Palace above. I bought two copies of the mountain gazette from a mountain monk. At 11:00, I went down the mountain and borrowed a peasant house for lunch.</p>

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Gandhi was born in Rajkot, a place in West India. Rajkot is not far from Mumbai. Gandhi's father was over forty years old when he was born. At the age of seven, according to Indian custom, he married. He was timid by nature, afraid of thieves, snakes, and ghosts. His courage was far less than his wife's. Indian religions prohibit eating meat. As a child, he learned to smoke, stealing money from servants to buy cigarettes. Later, he resolved to repent. He ate meat several times within a year when he was a teenager. Later, he swore to his mother to abstain completely. After the age of eighteen, he studied in England. Their clan system did not allow going abroad, because going to foreign countries required eating with foreigners. The elders expelled him from the church. This shows how important Indians considered eating together. He studied law in England for three years. He traveled to Paris and visited the Exposition and the highest Eiffel Tower. He quoted Tolstoy's mocking words about the Eiffel Tower: "This thing cannot represent the architect's wisdom, but only his stupidity, because it will soon oppress people's spirits under the tower." This was his criticism against materialism. He followed Tolstoy, and was even more courageous. Tolstoy also said, "We are not children now, we can be fooled by this toy." After returning to China, he worked as a lawyer in Mumbai in 1893. Later, he went to South Africa, because Indians were not allowed to sit in second-class carriages there and were beaten by white people for no reason. This aroused the idea of ​​national self-determination. He bought a first-class ticket, but was not allowed to ride in the first-class carriage. When he went to the shops where Indians were, the white people took them away and did not eat with them. There were even so-called special laws in Transwaal, a British territory. In Transwaal, Indians were not allowed to walk on public roads and were not allowed to travel after 9 p.m. All kinds of mistreatment led him to guide the masses and launch a movement for autonomy, starting with the Indian overseas Chinese in South Africa. After three years in South Africa, he returned to Mumbai and the movement was very effective. He failed in Calcutta, so he took his family back to South Africa. He was often beaten by white people. He was spared thanks to the protection of a police officer's wife. When he returned home from South Africa for the second time, the overseas Chinese gave him a lot of gold, silver, and diamonds. He gave them all away, saying, "These are superfluous things." In 1901, he returned to India and visited the Deer Park and various Indian temples. He always took third-class carriages. After going to various places to hold meetings and promote autonomy, he went to South Africa again. He promoted the use of local products by the local people, with each family doing their own labor, weaving cloth for their own use. Gandhi himself did the laundry and could cut his own hair. He was very effective. He relied on the power of the Indian religion. He devoted himself to proving the effectiveness of vegetarianism with science. He did not advocate class struggle, but used persuasion. This autobiography only ends with the first volume. There is still a second volume, which I heard has just been published. The whole volume is written in a self-narrating tone, which can be compared with Sun Yat-sen's autobiography and Kropotkin's autobiography. I read a magazine in my early years that said his father was a high official, and compared this autobiography to it. That was a mistake in translation and hearsay. There are many powerful Indian poems in his book. The motto is "Do my duty, even if I fail, I will be honored." Many of his poems are in the book Gita, which has an English translation.</p>

<p>The Gold Market Outlook is Peaceful</p>
<p>Early swap market offered by bulls. Yesterday, the benchmark gold price on the 15th fell and then rose again. The market trend remained flat. There were only two or three lots of trades. However, a total of ten lots were reviewed throughout the day, and eventually rose slightly by two taels. Since the swap period had arrived, the transactions of each bank were not significant, and the market became sluggish early in the morning. Stimulated by the rebound in the silver market, there were still more sellers afterwards, once breaking the 710 tael level. However, the exchange rate was extremely peaceful and the listing price remained the same. It seemed to be improving in the future, because buyers were diligent. The market was usually weak on Wednesdays due to the exchange rates, so it was still calm at the beginning. It was said that each bank had started doing swap business in advance. The bulls still offered, initially at 2.50 taels, but then the bulls, believing that their cash reserves were not large, were unwilling to offer too much, so the bears could not force the price up. The price was then reduced to 2 taels, and then a little over 2 taels. Each bank, such as Shunli, Wanxing, Hengxing, Tong Taichang, Zhenchang, and Xiang, had swap transactions with each other, and quite a few people traded based on today's listed price. It was also found that firms such as Yuancheng, Xinheng, Yongheng, and spot traders were short, while Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Wu were long. There were not many transactions in May, but suddenly large firms such as Chenfeng and Yong began to compete for purchases, which led to a strong upward trend, from soft to sharp. This was due to speculation. The closing price was the highest, reaching more than 718 taels. There may be no changes in the big bars this morning, but the gold price can be expected to improve.</p>

Subsequently, Yu Da and others sold, and the price fell by more than one tael. However, trading was brisk, because the swap market had already opened privately in the market. The price fell to 12 taels until 3:30. Afterwards, it seemed to show a sharp upward trend, because large firms such as Chenfeng, Yong, Daxing, Yongyi, and Fengyong suddenly started buying, and the market soared. After 4:00, it had exceeded 17 taels, with only one tael of fluctuation. The closing price at 4:30 reached 18.30 taels, an increase of 1.80 taels compared to the previous day.

<p>Recently, the market sentiment for silver and foreign coins has been very different. The supply and demand of silver roots cannot be free, and the result is not good. Instead, it makes eager demand impossible, and the situation suddenly becomes exhausted. The silver discount has no good face to say. The consumption of foreign dimes is very smooth in various ports, and the cocoon demand is also in the possible range, proceeding with a camera, so there is no need to worry about the sales aspect, so the price is high, and people's hearts are more and more agile.</p>
<p>Discount Price (Foreign Dime) There are many buyers in the morning, and people's hearts are firm. As a result, it soared by 1.5 cents, to 7.2925 cents. The noon market rose by another 0.125 cents, to 7.29375 cents, which opened a new record heard this year. (Silver Discount) The morning and noon markets are all white loans, and the silver roots are extremely loose and unbearable. There is no question about the head.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market Sentiment The morning and noon markets in Jiangnan are the same at 6.485 cents, 0.25 cents less than the previous noon, making a transaction of 6,000 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the noon market.

<p>Yesterday, the export of foreign money was very large. It was heard that in the Chongqing market, in order for the banks to absorb reserve funds, the price was raised to absorb cash, resulting in the depletion of cash. They sent telegrams to Shanghai and Hankou to purchase and load foreign coins. However, Hankou naturally also turned to Shanghai to purchase抵, so there was a large demand for the entire amount, relying entirely on the supply from Shanghai. More than 1 million has been loaded and shipped out continuously in recent days, and yesterday another large batch was loaded and shipped out, totaling more than 2 million. However, since Shen厘 has risen to about 3 points, it is feared that the Chongqing market is not very cost-effective, or it may be terminated. However, since the cash is exhausted, it must be purchased even at a high price. It is heard that in addition to loading Chongqing yesterday, Shanghai also went to the northern route with more than 400,000.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Long-term Interest Rate Made 9.5 Taels <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 15th, a big period, and the long-term 款 that expired must be delivered. It is heard that there are many transfers of this 款, but the prices vary. It ranges from 7.75 taels to 10.075 taels, a difference of 3 taels. The estimated amount is no less than 10 million, of which long-term deposits account for about one-third, totaling 3 to 4 million. As for new transaction news, it was heard yesterday that Zhongxinchang and other tea houses completed tens of thousands of transactions, with an interest rate of 6 pairs (i.e., 6 months) at 9.5 taels, and 3 pairs (i.e., 3 months) at 9.25 taels. The miscellaneous gangs on this street also had a few tens of thousands of transactions, and the interest rate is unknown, but it is estimated to be around 9 taels. The securities debt market is increasingly strong.</p>
<p>However, 96 fell slightly, with a total transaction of more than 8.1 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the public debt futures were slightly inferior to the previous day, the popularity of both buyers and sellers was still not lonely. The total for the whole day was 8,175,000 yuan. The spot goods continued to open at 25忽, with a transaction of 20,000 yuan, and the rest were only a few thousand yuan, totaling 33,200 yuan. As for the changes in the prices of each debt, due to the good morale in the market, investment purchases from all parties were still more prosperous than sales, so the price still trended upwards, with each rising by 12角 to 56角 compared to the previous day. Only 96 was slightly fatigued compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Yarn Flower Yarn Market Dim and Spiritless</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending weakly, and the overseas flower and yarn conditions are uniformly trending downwards, and the decline is even more severe. Therefore, people's hearts have turned weak, but the market atmosphere in the market is extremely dissipated and there is no excitement, so both buyers and sellers are holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, most of the retail investors are selling short. As for the giant manufacturers, they are pulling tight and not letting go. There are still many empty dishes in the front and back markets. The current situation is abnormally scattered, and there is a fear that there will be a long-term expulsion.</p>
<p>From the standard weak people, the market opened in the morning. With the further decline of American cotton, people's spirit was sluggish. Retail investors sold, and each fell by one or two to seven or eight cents. The market atmosphere in the afternoon was still flat, and some people were emptying, and each month rose slightly by two, three, four, and five cents. The total turnover for the whole day was 6,950 bales. It was found that 800 bales were sold to Gongtai, 850 bales to Taichang, 700 bales to Xincheng, and 400 bales to Tianlong. 1,000 bales were purchased by Yichang, 650 bales to Changfeng, 350 bales to Gengfeng, and 750 bales to Taishengkang.

<p>The current demand is still good, and the sales of the current yarn are still good.

<h3 id="e95">Cotton Market Suddenly Turns Weak <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market suddenly became fatigued. Because American cotton has no continued increase in strength, and it has also been reported to fall, which has weakened people's hearts and slightly reduced the buying power. However, the Japanese merchant Dongmian Foreign Company still purchased and did more because the bottom goods in various places were exhausted, and the source was lacking. It is said that the market price in Hankou is very high, so the buyer is still tightening. As for the foreign cotton conditions, it is very weak, so there are still many people who are short.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Fell by 3 Cents. The Hankou standard market opened in the morning and fell with foreign cotton. People's hearts softened and each fell by two or three cents. The situation in the afternoon was flat, with ups and downs of 5 points. The total turnover for the whole day was 28,600 Dan. It was found that 600 Dan were sold to Heshen and 1,700 Dan were sold to Xinheng. 3,800 Dan were purchased by Gengfeng and 1,100 Dan were purchased by Shenda and 1,900 Dan were purchased by Ruiyuan.

<p>However, the British and Indian Cotton Markets Are Still Trending Firm</p>
<p>American cotton longs close out. Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but then it was fatigued due to the weakness of Wall Street and the closing out of longs. Futures fell by 14 to 17 pounds, and spot goods fell by 15 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 89 points, and spot goods rose by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 5 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by exporters, but then returned due to profit-taking by longs and sales by brokers. Pinger near and far term rose by two rupees, Omlar rose by two rupees, far term rose by three rupees, and Bairuo Creek rose by two rupees.

<p>Grain Rice Market Turns to Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday, a large number of boats came down the river in Zhabei, about 40. The sales from various parties were okay in the early morning. Afterwards, the appetite for white japonica rice turned sluggish, and the appetite for zero-sale shops was unanimously waiting and watching. The market gradually tended to be weak, but the prices throughout the day were all similar to the previous day. The arrival and sales of thin rice were balanced, without ups and downs. The arrival of Yanduxian and Bu Xian were inconsistent, and the sales were still not expanded. Each file was kept at the original disk, the white yuan market was set, customer sales were silent, and the arrival of goods was received. The situation was mediocre. Looking at the rice market situation in the city, it will turn fatigued. The amount to be received down the river will reach more than 150, and it will be difficult to be optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources from various parties in Shanghai South continued, and the sales of this street were sluggish. The sales of each machine's white japonica rice market have returned to flatness. The market price has barely risen or fallen. The situation of early thin rice in the Southern gang is not good, and most buyers are standing by and doing nothing, resulting in few transactions and the market is in a stable state. The arrival of Yanduxian is not thick, but the sales are not reduced, so the price is also flat. The appetite for white yuan hanging rice is not bad, and there is no major change in the big market.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Standard Flour Ends Well <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month was quite fatigued because the price of foreign wheat was reported to be a little more than two or three cents. Then, the multi-headed outside the industry saw that the market was not big or small, and the buying atmosphere was good again, and the market was also more stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, the shipment in the northern road was still smooth. The manufacturers' chips in this month were also selling well, and they continued to withdraw the recent months by themselves. Because of the recent, and the pricing of Australian wheat must be 4.32 taels, in comparison, it is necessary to look at望, so it also fluctuated with each disk. After observing the following steps, this month will be the key point with one cent. It is hoped that there will be no hope of passing the big. As a result, this month was 0.0175 cents higher than the previous day, 0.02 cents higher in May, June, and July, 0.015 cents higher in August, and 0.0125 cents higher in September.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Flour Futures Rise in Afternoon <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour futures market was generally stable in the morning session, with little change compared to the previous day. However, in the afternoon session, the flour market strengthened again, and the demand for spot wheat from northern ports became more active. It was reported that the Qingdao traders purchased three to four thousand bags of foreign wheat yesterday, with the price reaching 4.01 taels per bag. In addition, the combined price of foreign wheat is now about 3 mace lower, which has boosted the confidence of both near-term and long-term investors. Looking ahead, the market may continue to improve. As a result, the March contract rose by 4 fen from the previous day, the May contract rose by 5 fen, the June contract rose by 3 fen, the July contract rose by 4 fen, the August contract rose by 2 fen, and the September contract rose by 4 fen.</p>

New York sugar futures for May fell by 2 fen, and other months also fell by 1 fen each. Spot and futures Javanese sugar remained unchanged.

The market was generally stable.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: White Crepe Declines After Arriving in Hankou</p>
<p>The local cotton market remains firm, and sales are quite active. However, customs clearance for exports has not yet started, but some customers have already had their goods transported by Japanese trading companies. Yesterday, Hankou traders shipped more than 400 pieces, mainly fine cloth, so the price was able to hold steady. Caiqiu was 7.0625 taels, Yang　 was 7.0675 taels, Lanji was 7.0425 taels, and Lanshuangyu was 7.07 taels. There is still strong local demand for heavyweight coarse cloth.

Copper plate was 4.03 taels, Moganshan Banana Leaf Title Poem was 4.0175 taels, and Circus was 4.015 taels. Zhongshan Ne continues to rise, Banana Leaf was 3 mace, and Huan Taizi was 2.0925 taels. There is strong local demand. Yuan Yang yarn remains firm, mainly because the asking price for Western goods is too high, so sales are not very good. Yesterday, Hua Meiren and Li Taibai were both 14.05 taels, Xiao Meiren was 12.025 taels, and Dian Qiuxiang was 10.065 taels. Thirty-yard goods are now quite rare.

<p>French Iron Nails Turn Weak, Then Strong</p>
<p>The price of French iron nails rose to 9 taels yesterday, an increase of 1 mace compared to the previous day. Only 200 to 300 barrels were sold to traders on Changjiang Road. It is reported that small sizes such as 1 inch, 1.5 inch, and 1.75 inch are currently in short supply in the market, so individual prices must be increased.</p>
<p>English Steel Plate Listless and Depressed</p>
<p>The English steel plate market has been quite listless recently. The export traders have stopped operating, and the machinery factories are not buying, so the market is very quiet. The market situation is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. 2.5 fen is sold at 9 taels, 5 fen is 6.09 taels, 7.5 fen is 6.05 taels, and 1 fen is 6.025 taels.</p>
<p>English Tinplate Price Rises 5 Mace</p>

However, more than 2,000 bundles arrived yesterday at the New Taikoo warehouse.

Only　 Changjin imported ten bales of fine dried silk, Xiangji imported seven bales of Sichuan raw silk, and Meida, etc., imported seventeen bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices remain generally flat and weak.</p>

<h3 id="e101">A Visit to the Morning Light Art Society <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jun</p>
<p>The Fifth Exhibition is About to Open</p>
<p>In the springtime, with the sound of birds chirping, the sky is boundless blue, and the wildflowers are in full bloom. Looking into the distance at the powder-green forest, interspersed with a few eye-catching red flowers, clinging to the foot of the spring mountain like ink, a few houses, a few barks of dogs. At this moment, walking on Jiangwan Road, I felt as if I were intoxicated by the mellow wine brewed in spring. The weather was exceptionally warm, and occasionally a spring breeze gently caressed the lush green branches. Being confined for a few months in a house where I could not see a single bit of the clear sky, like a monk in an ancient temple, I was fortunate enough to experience a bit of nature's flavor this time. Although I walked alone, my heart was filled with boundless joy, no less than that of a lark soaring in the sky. When I walked to Garden Street, the surroundings were completely shaded by tree branches. Suddenly, a cool air passed through my entire body. The quiet beauty of spring's eternal painting made me take lighter steps, not daring to make any rude sounds, lest I wake the spring god who was guarding this place from his midday nap. Apart from me leisurely walking by, there were only a few swallows flying low to the ground.</p>
<p>I saw a building with a Western ancient flavor, standing out from the surrounding greenery. I knew this</p>
<p>was the Morning Light Art Society.</p>
<p>So, my walk made a temporary stop here.</p>
<p>I knocked on their door, which was not closed, and a waiter immediately led me into their room, which was upstairs facing the street. It had the advantage of enjoying the morning sun and evening glow, without the noise of traffic. This was truly a great place to paint.</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Wang was in front of an easel, raising his sharp and spirited eyes to look at me, and greeted me in this way:</p>
<p>"Ah, I haven't seen you for a long time..."</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, you are really busy."</p>
<p>I found that the corner of the wall was piled with oil paintings, and the paintbrushes in their hands still seemed very busy. Three or four people were painting non-stop.</p>
<p>"Because we have a scheduled exhibition date! April 25th! Very close to now."</p>
<p>"I think most of it is finished."</p>
<p>"Those are all painted. There are still a few that have not been completed."</p>
<p>"Mr., I think this exhibition will definitely be more satisfying for everyone."</p>
<p>"Not necessarily," he was still mixing colors on the palette, but a restless smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>"Which session is this?"</p>
<p>"The fifth session."</p>
<p>"Ah, it has a long history."</p>
<p>"Our first exhibition, if I remember correctly, was in 1920."</p>
<p>"Because of the long period of time, your output must be very large now."</p>
<p>So, I walked to the place where the painting boards were stacked and flipped through them casually.</p>
<p>"Are there any other subjects here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, our output not only includes revolutionary history but also many Chinese ancient legends, as well as descriptions of the current suffering of the people."</p>
<p>"I think these are very important to us."</p>
<p>There were several easels placed in the room, and everyone was looking at the painting from different angles. Mr. Wang was concentrating all his energy on the painting. In the moment of stopping the brush, he sometimes scratched his hair in bitter contemplation, and sometimes showed a gentle smile. I saw the difficulty of creation here. But these many works stacked on the four walls, I don't know how much time and energy they took. At this time, I felt the greatness of the artists even more, creating a mythic world of beauty for us.</p>
<p>Not daring to disturb their work with endless talk, I just looked at the many works on my own, but the mood in my heart changed with the different tunes.</p>
<p>I saw a work titled "Red Terror," which gave me a great shock. It was a person with a blue face and fangs, holding a sharp blade in his hand, jumping out of the flames. This person was very much like a demon in mythology. The second was "Impression of Changsha," which almost awakened the terror of being frightened several times a night in my hometown. Countless naked men and women were lying on the ground, still bleeding. The dark smoke of the dim sky and the wind swirled, and the red tongues of fire rushed over. The cries of the people struggling and moaning under the massacre were still faintly discernible. So, I immediately retreated to my original seat, breathing abnormally fast, as if I were possessed by a nightmare. However, they were all still working there, taking a short break for a few minutes before I gradually woke up from the chaotic thoughts. So, I flipped through it again. In that stack of works, the work titled "Creation" used dim tones everywhere to bring out the gradually bright mountain top. If I guessed correctly, the person stretching out his arms might be because, in the sound sleep of the night, a flash of lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, like the dazzling light in the painting, shaking open the mountains and forests, and waking up the sleeping person. So, in the moment of jumping up, the sun spewed out ten thousand golden snakes in the mountains that were towering into the clouds, giving the world light and heat again. At this time, I also seemed like the person who stretched out his arms and shouted to the sky.</p>
<p>Many other powerful and vivid good works all jumped into my eyes. There were also a few titled "Virgin Killing the Snake," "Nüwa," and "Houyi Shooting the Sun," all descriptions of ancient legends. I broke the silence with a surprised voice, and Mr. Wang, moved by my curiosity, immediately put down his paintbrush and turned to explain the meaning of each picture to me. I stood beside him listening, as interesting as when I was a child listening to adults telling me stories.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang saw my childish smile, and he smiled too.</p>
<p>The last rays of the sun shone into the window, and my eyes shifted to the works depicting war. Seeing the revolutionary soldiers crossing the Yellow River, seeing thousands of people gathering there to hold a mass meeting, and the observation on the battlefield, all made me feel the enthusiasm and madness. So, in the midst of the ever-changing situation, I felt as if I had enjoyed a grand feast. Although I had seen several art exhibitions before, the impressions they gave me all disappeared like faint smoke long ago, and there was not a single one that made me linger. Although I am not worthy of mentioning art and appreciation, the impression I got today will never be forgotten. So, I expressed my thanks to Mr. Wang in this way:</p>
<p>"Today, it is the first time I have come into contact with works surrounded by a life aura."</p>
<p>"No, we still feel that these small gains are not enough."</p>
<p>"Well said... well said..."</p>
<p>When I lit a cigarette and looked at the approaching twilight outside, everyone had stopped writing and was preparing to go back in a hurry.</p>
<p>So, I shook hands with Mr. Wang and hurried out of the Morning Light Art Society, my heart still filled with longing at this moment.</p>
<p>Ah, artists are the supreme creators.</p>

<p>— Anping</p>
<p>IX. My Grandmother</p>
<p>As soon as the train passed Jinan, it gradually got dark. That night, I went to sleep very early because I had to change trains in Tianjin early the next morning to go to Beiping. I slept very well that night. However, for some reason, I seemed to see my grandmother. Needless to say, that was just a dream. I have to admit that I did dream of my grandmother that night. Although I no longer remember the details of that dream, I must say that my grandmother was one of the people in the world who loved me the most, and one of the people in the world who had the greatest kindness to me. I, who lost my mother six days after being born, was entirely raised by my grandmother. The spiritual comfort and pleasure I gave my grandmother is another matter. My grandmother raised me, loved me, and educated me. At least I have to admit that without her, there would not be a me who is still acceptable today. She could never forget her little grandson in everything. She would give Anping candy first, cut a piece of nice fabric for Anping first, and take Anping with her wherever she went to play. In all my memories, she never hit me more than five times. It is natural to say that an adult not hitting a child is not love, but she could not bear to hit me. She loved me, but I cannot say that she spoiled me. Troubles come from chopsticks, and filial sons come from pampering. She also said that her way of teaching me, the most effective method was not hitting, but the "expression" on her face. She usually loved me so much, but when she put on a stern look, everyone was afraid. She always said that Anping was unlucky and looked at my fair face. What did I know when I was little?</p>
<p>I had never left my grandmother until the year I first went to Nanjing to study. It was only then that I understood my grandmother's love.</p>
<p>Things in the world are often like this. You have to wait until you know this is happiness before you are no longer happy. Who doesn't think childhood is lovely, but who feels that childhood is lovely during childhood? Likewise, I said that I only really understood my grandmother's love then, but from that year on, I could no longer get my grandmother's love. My grandmother died in May of that year. Died.</p>
<p>I really don't want to think about these things anymore because thinking about these things will make me sad. What I relied on when I was little was my grandmother, and what my grandmother only got pleasure from was me. For the sake of her grandson's studies, she helped him pack his bedding and luggage with great pleasure. However, after my grandmother died, what did the family members talk about when they reminisced? They said that after I went to Nanjing, my grandmother's life underwent a very dark change. Her life seemed to have lost a lively sun and often became very gloomy and melancholy. Every time she received a letter from me from school in Nanjing, she was happy as if she had something. She called people to read it to her, once, twice, three times. Because my grandmother was seriously ill, I rushed back from Nanjing. My family was also happy, saying that her most beloved grandson had rushed back and that it might make her feel better. As soon as I ran home, I buried my head in her arms. God, what did I know then? She no longer had the strength to say a word, and I didn't know what was the most appropriate thing to say to comfort her. I just lay on the edge of the bed like a little lamb, letting her touch my bare little face. She closed her eyes, focused her spirit, as if touching a rare treasure, and occasionally lifted her eyelids to look at me, to see if I was thin or fat.</p>
<p>God no longer stayed her for another year or half for the misfortune of her little grandson. She died in May of that year.</p>
<p>After my grandmother died, I never had anyone who loved me like my grandmother loved me. My grandmother died ten years ago. I often remember her, but I rarely dream of her, rarely dreaming of her once in a year or two. But if I really dream of her, it seems that this dream has some meaning.</p>
<p>The one who loved me the most was my grandmother, and the one my grandmother loved the most was me. Even after she died, her soul still often patrolled around me. Whenever something very unusual happened, I would dream of her. That time in the car, I dreamed of my grandmother again. After waking up from the dream, I missed her strangely and was also strangely grateful to her. If there is such a thing as a soul, I believe that her soul is always patrolling and protecting me.</p>
<p>X. From Tianjin to Beiping</p>
<p>Before dawn on the fifth, the porter woke up all the guests. The train from Pukou to Beiping did not need to change trains in Tianjin, but during the few days I went to Beiping that time, it was said that it had to change. The porter woke up many guests so early, no more than to let everyone tidy up their personal belongings so that they could collect some "tips".</p>
<p>Tianjin has a total of three stations, one called the Old Station, one called the Main Station, and another I forgot the name of. I don't know which station I came down from. It was just dawning when I arrived in Tianjin. The distant electric lights were sparkling like the stars in the sky. People in the car really didn't feel cold. As soon as they got out of the car, the wind alone was enough to make people suffer.</p>
<p>After sitting in the waiting room for a while, they said that the train to Beiping had arrived, so I ran out again. Because I was not familiar with the road, I called a porter to carry my briefcase for me. Rather than saying he was carrying things, it was better to say that I called him to lead the way. From that car to this car, it was really just a few steps. He said there were rules and that he wanted four dimes from me. I thought the people in the north were honest, and anyway, I was coming to the north for the first time, so I didn't care and gave it to him. But when I got on the train to Beiping, I saw that people with six or seven pieces of luggage had not given two dimes. Only then did I realize that I had been cheated.</p>
<p>If I had gone to Beiping and only stayed for three or five days before returning, then Beiping, just the climate, would have given me a very bad impression. There is nothing to worry about in the north except for the wind. When it blows, there is nothing you can do. Just walking out of a car with a climate like the fourth or fifth month in Jiangnan, how could you stand it? People in the north mostly wear leather hats that can be turned down and leather coats with very high and wide collars. The use of these is all here. For example, in Shanghai, the collar of a leather coat is two inches wide, that's enough. In the north, it has to be twice as wide. I really suffered that day. When I was waiting for the train, it felt like there was wind everywhere, drilling straight into your neck. The ears gradually changed from soft to hard, and the nose was the same. Moreover, the snot slowly flowed out like a spring.</p>
<p>The second-class car on the Pingjin Road is simply not much different from the third class. It is equally old, broken, and untidy. It takes three hours to get from Tianjin to Beiping. The countryside in the north is always so monotonous. I remember when I returned to Jiangnan from Beiping, as soon as I stepped on the Jinghu Line, there was green grass, blue water, lovely. In the north, don't say on the train, but in any wilderness, I am afraid you can't find a beautiful scenery like Jiangnan. It is an endless expanse of thousands of acres of yellow soil, and you can't see where the sky and the earth meet. Or, those are some distant shadows of trees, a row of gray and black, often in mid-air, rising a streak of white air, cutting off the waist of the tree shadows. You would guess that this white air is clouds or fog, but I have to say it is sand.</p>
<p>The gray sand in the north is really powerful. When it comes, you close your eyes and feel small grains of sand sprinkling on your face. The north doesn't have rain often like Jiangnan, and the land is dry and loose all year round, so it flies up when it encounters wind.</p>
<p>The train arrived in Beiping around 11 o'clock in the morning. After getting off the train, I followed the others out of the platform, not knowing east from west. I wanted to find a hotel first. Before leaving Shanghai, someone said that the Garden Hotel and the Central Hotel were good. The Garden Hotel was just a little farther away, and the Central Hotel, if there was no bath room, would be fine for more than three dollars a room. I decided to look for the Central, but in the end, I never met the Central's receptionist. I just vaguely followed the Oriental Hotel's receptionist to the Oriental.</p>
<p>The Oriental Hotel's receptionist put me in a car and sent me from the station to the hotel. Although the people in the north are famously honest, for the sake of caution, I asked:</p>
<p>"Is this car specially prepared by your hotel to pick up guests?"</p>
<p>He said yes. I thought some hotels in Shanghai also had their own cars to pick up guests. I asked again:</p>
<p>"Then the fare is not borne by the guests, right?"</p>
<p>He also said yes. He said that the fare was calculated by the accounting room of their hotel. I thought that asking this, there would be no problems, so I sat in it.</p>
<p>From the station to the Oriental, hiring a rickshaw would probably not cost even a dime. With such a short distance, the car arrived in less than three or four minutes. Businessmen always love to make exorbitant demands. The waiter led me into a big room for twelve dollars a day. I laughed and said that I was not taking office as a committee member here, so why live in such a good room?</p>
<p>In the end, I lived in a room for three dollars a day, which was not bad. There was a radiator, but before I had even sat down, a signature slip was sent upstairs, saying that I had to sign it. I took a look, and it was the car fare just now, a big pan of one dollar and forty cents. The meaning was that after I signed it, I didn't have to pay now, and it would be calculated together when the room fee was calculated in the future. I knew I had been cheated, so I had to call the receptionist who picked me up from the station just now to come up and ask. He also knew he was wrong and just used some irrelevant words to beg for mercy in front of me. The waiters in Beiping are born with a cautious face and a humble attitude. I thought, forget it, anyway, I took the car myself, so pay it.</p>
<p>But because I was afraid that they would squeeze me again, it made me have to ask the price even when I called for a bowl of noodles later.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Establishing the Shanghai East Office of the Caoye Society <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Caoye Society, located at 34 Fairen Road, was established on April 15th, 1929. The inaugural issue of the Caoye Weekly was published on May 4th, and it has been published weekly ever since, with increasing circulation. The Hangzhou branch was established on September 15th of last year, headed by Mr. Fan Dajun, and the society's affairs there are also unusually thriving. Each week, it sells over 700 copies of the Caoye Weekly from the head office. On April 10th of this year, it added a branch publication, the "Wild Grass Weekly." Due to the large number of society members in Shanghai and the heavy workload, the head, Mr. Jin Kuansheng, has established a local branch office at No. 33 Nanlu Lane, next door to the Ming Garden on Huade Road. Society members and readers in Shanghai East can inquire about anything, apply for membership, or subscribe from 12:00 noon to 2:00 PM and after 5:00 PM every day at the branch office. Everything is exactly the same as at the Fairen Road head office. A Shanghai West office will soon be established near the Jing'an Temple in Shanghai West to further expand the society's affairs. The head office's business hours are from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM daily, and it is open all day on Sundays.</p>
