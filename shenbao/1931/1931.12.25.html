<h3>謹貢獻於一中全會丨整理財政（一）</h3>
<p>財政爲國家一切政治措施之泉源其關係於一國政治之修明與紊亂至爲重大就財政學之見地而言「財」爲一事「政」又爲一事有充實之「財」尤賴有運用得當之「政」故有政無財爲浪費貧窮而有政尙不必致亂惟浪費之極則必致民困乏官貪污政紊亂國家一切之危機皆由此而滋生</p>
<p>我國今日言及財政者莫不痛心疾首認爲毫無辦法認爲我國窮民困債台高築財政已陷入涸竭之絶境吾人則認爲我國今日非爲無財特爲無政不僅無政即照例應有之糊塗賬目亦莫可究詰所謂財政特不過加緊人民血肉之榨取經理出入借欵之支付分配實力派之需索籌集延長内亂之戰費但有私人之財政而無國家之財政私人愈富而人民愈瘠國家則愈貧窮政治亦愈紊亂所以致今日之國本動搖民生凋敝財政之紊亂實爲其大因　吾人茲綜合散在國内報纸上之中央以及各省各地之財政消息而觀則我國家財政之一塌糊塗誠已至極如曰財政破産則我國今日實超破産而上之依據財政部十七年度與十八年度之財政報告在十七年六月三十止之經濟年度短絀總數爲八千萬元而十八年短絀總數則爲一萬萬零一百萬元十九年財政無報告然而短絀之增加當無可疑據吾人所知政府已發行鹽務公債八千萬元此種短絀逐年增加之情况誠如財政部長宋子文在報告中所言「國民政府每年預算短絀問題乃是一個嚴重問題」</p>
<p>至於各省之情况如安徽據今年四月底財政廳長呈省政府文云「民國十九年收支兩數相差甚鉅即加入中央協濟之欵尙不敷二百五十萬元」</p>
<p>而據今年四月初上海報纸所載則更謂「安徽財政二十年收支兩抵不敷四百七十萬賦税實收僅及八成不敷之數約在六百餘萬」如浙江據今年九月間報纸所載一二十年預算不敷四百萬省有財産能抵押者已抵押殆盡於無可如何之際擬將四十餘萬之紹興田賦作抵向杭州銀行團抵借三十萬箔類營業税每年原可征二百二十萬元但早已指抵杭銀行團一百五十萬元之用」如江西據九月間報纸所載「全省收入六月份僅得一萬餘元而政費開支月達三十萬元中央雖按月補助十萬元仍苦不足如湖南自裁厘而後每月收入驟减六七十萬元中央雖按月補助二十萬元但相差仍多無法彌縫政費積欠無法維持如山西據今年二月二十一日商震在北平與新聞記者談話謂一晉省每年收入爲一千六百萬元軍費支出爲三千一百二十萬元政費八百萬元收支兩抵不敷二千四百萬元」如河南據今年三月間財政廳長報告一河南田賦已預徴至二十六年各縣巿雜捐凡七十六種省庫收入每月至多不過五十五萬七千餘元每月支出需一百十八萬元每月不敷六十二萬元」如廣東據四月間報纸所「國税每月實收爲一百八十四萬省税實收二百一十四萬而支出則每月爲七百五十餘萬不敷之數每月爲三百三十萬」如上海巿據巿政府三月初報告「十九年的預算收入爲六百五十萬元支出爲七百零二萬元不敷五十餘萬元」而今年不敷之數仍逾五十萬元故今年三月間已决發公債三百萬元如天津巿據今年四月間報紙所載天津本年財政不敷百七十萬上述各省各地財政情况。雖材料稍嫌過舊。搜羅亦嫌不盡不實。然而舉其一斑卽可覘知全豹吾人蓋可斷言今日我國各省財政上之艱窘情况但有程度之差異。其月苦不足。惟藉舉債或以加徵捐稅。以資彌縫。殆無一省一處而能例外。</p>
<p>國家財政上之艱窘情狀旣如上述。然而考其用途。則水利荒廢以致今年空前之水災。交通梗塞。必要之鐵道幹綫。亦無法敷設。教育經費。長期拖欠。全國學校。馴至關門。工商實業。凋敝不振。舉國荒凉。以視歐美諸國之建設。差若天淵。財政之艱窘如彼。建設之成績又如此。然而所加諸人民。則苛捐雜稅。榨壓無所不用其極。如上述河南財政廳長所報告。田賦已徵至二十六年捐稅多至七十餘種。如四川捐稅繁多。無名可立。至藉口修橋。繳派橋捐。書籍印刷品過道每過一關卡。亦須繳納過道印花稅。而田賦則已預徵至民國三十年。又如廣東勒抽柴捐。江西徵收迷信捐。種種巧立名目。不可思議之捐稅。及勒逼榨取無所不用其極之手段使人民賣妻鬻子。逃死無所。輾轉流離求生無路。農皆離田。工皆失業四民都不安其所事。匪盜如毛飢饉薦至。政猛於虎。取之盡錙銖。人民負担如此其重。生活又如此其痛苦。然而國家財政之困乏。仍超越破産而上之此誠爲一極其矛盾之怪現象。是可知我國今日非爲無財。特爲無政我國家非眞貧困。特以財政上措施之乖張。故遂陷於貧乏之深淵。而末由振拔耳。</p>

<h3>日内閣更迭之展視（一）</h3>
<p>東京通信、記者於上月草内閣動掏之前奏曲一文時、記得說過若槻内閣壽命不久的話、時隔未久、不幸所言已中、宦海滄桑於此益信茲記其内閣更迭巓末如次、以爲留意海外時事者參考之用、</p>
<p>▲若槻内閣之窮途　本年四月十四日、若槻拜命組閣、履新以來、政策一如往昔、仍標榜着「則政節約」一非算債」「不增稅」「對華親善」等至上的方針但步步行來、滿地都是荆轉、上半年雖厲行官吏减俸以求緊縮、無如世界不景氣漩渦中之日本産業、實已奄奄待斃、結局明年度的預算案中、歲入不敷甚鉅、彌縫乏策、終至於不能不募債增稅以補塡、最近瀋陽事件勃發、政府完全屈服於軍閥淫威之下、外交已成了槍竿下的裝飾品、如此瘡痍滿身、民政若槻内閣、已深深走入於窮途之中了、</p>
<p>▲協力内閣說之再燃　安達於前月二十一日夜發表聲明書後、内閣已有動搖之色但其後明滅不定、略歸寗靜、不期本月九日、民政黨顧問富田與政友會幹事長久原會見時、成立了協力内閣三大實現方法、「（一）兩黨鑒於時局之重大、共當此難局（二）兩黨披瀝虛心赤誠、確立政策、以期國策之遂行（三）組閣大命、無論降於兩黨之任何人、關於閣僚之選考配置、應由兩黨首協議之、以求均等、」一時協力内閣說又再燃、而内閣中之現狀維持論派（若槻等）與協力論派、（安達等）遂生了一正面的抗爭各具成見、結局使民政若槻内閣陷入於内部分化之境、安達於本月五日、曾往訪過一次西圖寺公要求其對於協力内閣案、與以諒解、其後在表面上安達等雖採靜觀主義、但裏面却潛行的活動不止、九日富田久原協定成立、一方面富田又擬竭力說服若槻而安達又與井上懇　、但結果都未達目的、十日夜、　達自黨出身閣僚全體會議的半途歸宅、立召富田·山道·中野·永井·松田諸氏報告會議中閣僚等的一致主張現狀維持、同時徵取各人對於安達目前應取態度的意見、結果决定不放棄以前的主張和信念、卽首相等因意見不合而强要安達辭職時、安達亦認爲没有辭職之理由、若因安達不辭職、而引起内閣總辭職、那也是一件爲國家而不得已京的云云、</p>
<p>▲瓦解前之閣議與總辭職案　十一日午前十一時、在首相官邸開最末次閣議、除　達以外、餘　列席、閣議中擬於安達永無翻意時全體一律辭職、當時有少數人以爲在目下財政經濟外交多難時現内閣之責任極大不應輕率進退、而始終不棄其現狀維持論者、然最後終以内閣不統一之理由多數决定總辭職、一方更由井上與田中訪安達、先求其反省自决、如不聽、告以政府决定總辭職之意并促具提出辭表、結局安達斬釘截鐵的拒絶井上等的勸告、認總辭職爲一回不可避的事在此内外交攻之下、若槻内閣已至非總辭職不能下臺的局面了、十一日午後、若槻收集各閣僚的辭表、五時三十分、謁日皇於宫中學問所說明内閣總辭職的原因、退出後、又訪牧野内府鈴木侍從長於别室說明辭表捧呈之經過、以求諒解、午後六時若槻歸官邸、民政黨的若槻内閣至此遂瓦解、</p>
<p>▲犬養内閣之成立　若槻提出辭表的翌日、元老西園寺自興津坐漁莊入京、這西園寺的入京、當時引動了不少的猜疑、從來日本每遇政變、如西園寺不在京而日皇諮詢之時、向由勅使代答、這次西園寺不辭勞瘁、而特意入京各方面均互作猜測之辭、以爲「若據憲政常道論、自應奏匾薦犬養政友總裁但園公無須親身入京其結果或將鑑時局之重大而脫憲政之常道、在這裏政府方面斷定將大命再降下於若槻、而政友會方面則斷定人命必降於犬養、但或恐附帶何種與民政黨等合作之條件、」衆說紛纭、莫衷一是、十二日午後、西園寺到京、卽入宫先與牧野内府及鈴、木侍從長會見、彼此都認爲在目前時局之下、如薦犬養組閣時、應有待别之考慮旋謁日皇、申言適什的後繼内閣正在熟慮中云云、西園出宫歸宅卽招犬養來邸、詢問犬養的意思、謂「若大命降於足下時、對於此時局、將有何種的匡救策、」犬養的回答、非常抽象、謂「我平素向有一定不易的相當决心、我以爲祗須看一看我的平素、就不難諒解我罷、」西園寺與犬養交換意見的結果、彼此均歸一致、於是西園寺遂通告鈴木侍從長、推薦犬養爲後繼内閣的首班、並乞代奏日皇同日午後八時、犬養遂奉召入宫、拜受組織後繼内閣之命、歸邸後、卽以組織政友會單獨内閣之方針、着手組閣之準備、於是若槻内閣重登舞台之希望、乃完全斷絶、而政友犬養内閣遂以告成、（未完）</p>

<h3>中央銀行副總裁陳行婚姻訟事</h3>
<p>▲言淑芬好事輙多磨</p>
<p>▲兩度因緣一無成就</p>
<p>▲結束情史陳行被控</p>
<p>▲案中牽涉不少名人</p>
<p>▲訂婚經過　中央銀行副總裁陳行、字健庵、原籍浙江上虞、父早故、陳有族叔某、淸末　宦河南、時虞山言某、亦在其地作幕、彼此因訂交焉、旋陳諗言有女淑芬、方肄業於蘇州景海學校、才貌俱優乃以冰人自任、爲其姪健庵作伐、時健庵讀於海上之約翰大學、經言一度相攸、認爲允雀屏之選、遂訂婚約、互換戒指、以資信守　自是言深念此快婿家寒、恐膏火之資不繼、學或中輟、故時加資助、俾有造就、而此一對未婚夫婦、則亦芳訊頻通、自民元以至民六、情書往返、奚啻盈尺、</p>
<p>▲偶生芥蒂　惟中間曾偶以微嫌、略生芥蒂、淑芬憤而致書健庵、謂儂將抱獨身主義、君不妨另求嘉耦、然此種意見、不旋踵即冰釋、故淑芬之續函即聲明前此戲言、幸勿介介、但健庵爾時以須仰仗岳家扶植、對淑芬所加於己者、莫不逆來順受、不與之較、惟將該項函件什襲珍藏、留作異日交涉證據、</p>
<p>▲赴美游學　民六健庵卒業、應浙江省留學生考試、名列前茅、派赴美國遊學、雖屬官費、而岳家仍按年以欵接濟、總計先後所補助於陳之金錢、達二萬五千餘元之鉅、陳旣負笈出洋、淑芬亦畢業蘇校、時因其兄言敦源任北政府内務總長、遷居舊京、</p>
<p>▲另締良緣　迨至民八、健庵竟在美國另與蔡姓女結婚、特函冰人葉叔衡、要求與淑芬解除婚約、其理由即根據淑芬昔在景海時所致之一書、當時淑芬絶對不能同意、十一年夏問、健庵已學成歸國、且挈妻孥偕來、</p>
<p>▲歲月蹉跎　淑芬乃要以履行婚約、而健庵至是始大感困難、迎拒皆非、遂以敷衍相待、坐是歲月蹉跎、卒無善策解决　最後健庵自知斷難踐約、纔對淑芬曰、　者卿父垂靑、屢加資助、使余學旣有成、且獲美滿眷屬、今余亦必有以報卿、極願助卿出洋遊學、並祝卿亦如余之得一美滿伴侣、情詞懇摯、淑芬亦爲感動、但嗣以他故、未成事實、</p>
<p>▲好事中變　健庵其時已被任爲中華懋業銀行漢口分行行長職、從此地北天南、雲泥遠隔、淑芬家長以女年早長成、而前度劉郎　已絶問津之意、自難使之丫角終、會有前滬海道尹傅疆之侄傅鋭、字旡退、方自扶桑游學歸來、靑年俊逸、品學兼優、且正求凰之際、乃由京中聞人陳漢第·及淑芬姊丈葉景莘·作伐、與淑芬訂婚、但此舉純由言氏家長主動、而淑芬則絶對不同意、致吉期旣屆、變故突生、百年好合之事未諧、三生石上之盟頓爽、離合之速、實自有結婚史以來所未有也、</p>
<p>▲親訪總裁　從此淑芬寂處深閨、韶光虚擲、春花秋月、縱屬有情、劍會鏡圓、不知何日、迨至今年上季、淑芬得悉健庵已貴爲中央銀行副總裁、而自計年齡、復已四十有一、歲月催人容易老、蹉跎豈可復蹉跎、此一篇情史、亟須及時結束、因將歷年所積情書曁當日訂婚戒子、携帶來滬、親赴該行訪問、冀　面細訴衷曲、詎陳竟餉以閉門羹、</p>
<p>▲索償十萬　淑芬以彼恃副總裁之身份、靳不予見、則是昔日情誼、盡付東流、始毅然委託江一平律師、决訴諸法律、先行請求調解、卒無所成、遂正式提起控訴、請求判令被告償還代墊學費二萬五千元、及延不履行婚約、應賠償損失洋十萬元、</p>
<p>▲涉訟公庭　陳被控後、亦延吳經熊等律師辯訴、謂係原告嫌渠家貧、首先悔婚、嗣且已在北京與傅旡退結婚、主婚人爲旡退之叔傅寫沈（傅　）、證人爲前平政院院長邵章（字伯綗）、冰人爲陳漢第等、至於學費、亦僅得其資助　千三白元、且係贈與、後渠回國、亦已迭次津貼原告之母一千四百元、兩抵已無拖欠云云、</p>
<p>▲被審結果　庭訊時、有三數人到庭作證、謂淑芬前確在京與傅鋭結婚、新房設於東方飯店、但是夜新夫婦入洞房後、即起冲突、當晩各散、當時傳遍京華、資爲談助云云、初審終結、判决原告之訴駁斥、</p>
<p>▲上訴開審　原告不服、提起上訴、昨日午後、由江蘇高等法院第二分院沈推事開庭傳訊、江律師提出邵伯綗·傅旡退·兩人來函證明、實未結婚　當時因女不願、隨即退婚、並將其餘情書及戒指呈案、陳健庵不到、其友陶昌善·朱達參·到庭作證、所言仍如第一審相同、沈推事訊後、諭令改期、候再核奪、</p>

<h3>江蘇耆老馬相伯先生一夕談</h3>
<p>雲間亮訊</p>
<p>内政外交學風種種評論</p>
<p>十二月十八日下午訪九十二歲馬相伯老先生於土山灣、老先生時而握手、時而釋手、時而痛恨、時而笑駡、時而站起頓足、時而坐定拍案、内政啊、外交啊、學風啊、結果談幾句宗教、斷斷續續、拉拉雜雜、約說兩點多鐘、請你整理一下、記出來、披露我的心事、是很好的、我說很願把光明正大的議論、給大家看看、所謂言者無罪、聞者足戒嗎、以下馬先生說、</p>
<p>我們中國的歷朝成敗、無非是養蟲法兒、毒蟲咬毒蟲、咬勝的、就是皇帝、現在交通方便、就是把蠱匣的蓋兒揭開、這蠱蟲、一時不能咬勝他蟲、就跳到别的蠱匣裏、學了些新蠱法再跳到原匣裏去、那末舊蠱害怕被打敗了、就成了些皇帝啊、總統啊大元帥啊、……還有一種蠱、不做頭兒只做爪牙帮助蠱頭、吸收匣内各動物的精華、弄得各動物半死不活、什麽呌做暴君、就是直接間接殘害人民生命的人、我國日前、内政如此、貪汚徧地、外患來了、只有極少數的人拚命抵抗一下、盛地萬里、無人願問、受水災民、也是極少數的人去援救、政府對人民的死亡、絶不負責、這可算有國嗎五年以來、搜括百姓、除公債十　萬萬一千元外、還有出賦、關稅　　餘、統稅、和那種種苛捐虐稅、無微不至地的羅掘、總有三十餘萬萬之多、你看歷史上一元朝做皇帝、淸朝做皇帝、他們外國人不願人民痛苦、做了三百多年、盡量搜括、還没有這樣的多唉、因爲這兩種蠱、都只在亞細亞東部小匣子裏跳來跳去、所以心腸没有這樣的狠毒、手段也没有這樣的惡辣現在這蠱、花樣多了、本領大了經過人西洋、太平洋、爬到各島國入陸的西半球匣子裏做寄生蟲所以把本匣子裏的精華吸收得乾乾凈凈了、可憐啊我們這般動物、怎樣活得下呢、（拍桌）有一天、我同蔡孑民、經過上海西門地方、對他說、我們到過許多國境、看見多少國民、他國有這樣國民嗎、蔡先生不作聲、我又說、「各省苦民還要比這邊苦好幾十倍哩民生主義怎樣」蔡先生搖頭、</p>
<p>我記得同治年間、我國僑民、在美國被人殺死、我國政府不管、我對主管官說、爲什麽不理這案件他說誰呌他到外國去、我們不象夷人、爲了一個教士被害、就要出兵到中國尋　、我說這不是夷人的法子、我中國聖人的法子、書經上說、「爲其殺是童子而征之、」又說「爲匹夫匹婦復仇也、」保護國民是國家的責任、爲了一個童子、尚且出征而况一個傳教士呢、你看英法美各國人、到了中國、必定要有根據地、整理一切、居然成一個敵國的樣子、我國華僑、在南洋羣島、和其他各處、創事業、握商權、人旣衆多、占地廣大、然而没有組織、一盤散沙、一經挫折、就一蹶不振了、國聯靠得住嗎、在法國開會、法國就和日本密約、那俚有公道呢、一個人搶東西就是强盜、一國搶地皮、不也是强盜麽、强盜世界、自己豈可不正當防衞、盡力抵抗呢、不防不抗、他們必定要用「取亂侮亡」的方法來下手咧、可憐啊、（嘆氣）</p>
<p>淸朝光緒中間、徐家匯創辦某學校、當時有某西人做邦辦、英文用印度讀本、算學也很陳舊、我說、用英語「太瞧不起我們中國了」、他就忸怩說道「將來改良」、我就介紹幾種課本、幾個教員、去帮他的忙、我們中國人、究竟爭氣、現在這大學是很好了、蔡先生提倡學生干涉政治、方法很新、現在可以知道了、豈非因果相生嗎、學生兩個字要顧名義才好、學、然後可以稱生、不學、那就不可以稱生了、某大學、用法文教授、我知道他們的本領果然是……用外國　請學問、大費唇舌、中國人聽了、終究不大明白、若用中國語講學理、工夫可以减去四分之三、現在有一個人姓李名呌銘中、學問很好、比較在中國的西洋人、强得多、他先在中國求科學、嫌太淺、到法國留學八年、法人很佩服他、他現在南京鼓樓天文台任職、如果有人要請他任教授、我可决定比外國數理大家强些、因爲他用本國語講、容易使人明白的、</p>

<h3>虚僞的敎育　（如）</h3>
<p>敎育的主要目標、在養成各人眞實的能力、指導各人怎樣去求眞理、可是我國的敎育結果　造成一片虚僞的世界、</p>
<p>明明是辦學　錢偏要説是作育人才、明明只講吃·着·玩·和製造遊民的塲所、偏要説是研究學術的高深學府明明龍課、偏要説是救國、明明無事可做偏要説是加緊工作、像這種矛盾的言行不一而足、</p>
<p>學校是社會的小影、學校如此、社會上的形形色色更是蔚然入觀明明是有意屠殺、偏要説是無心溺斃、明明是　張爲幻　偏要説是指導民衆、明明是苛歛誅求偏要説是廉潔爲公、明明是不抵抗、偏要説是「禮讓爲國」像這樣我騙你你騙我下去、中國一定不會亡、因爲亡了、我們可以自騙自的説、「國雖亡、人心不死、大有可爲哩、」</p>
<p>虚僞的最大原因、爲自私自利的觀念、深中於人心而羞惡之心、尙未盡滅心上縱存着「一切權利屬於我、萬般罪惡歸諸人、」可是表面上不得不敷衍人家一下、因此爭奪的形式、更錯綜複雜、小小一個學校、可以存立兩個抗日救國會一個特别巿、可以組織兩個總工會、有了巿商會、再有商運會有了巿黨部再有黨務改進會、甚至有了中央政府、再有南北政治分會、今天你發宣言、明天我登啟事　日來翻開報纸祇見無數眞悟空假悟空向觀世音爭長論短、説白道黑、我們肉眼眞判别不出誰是誰非、</p>
<p>可是社會不是盲目的、當馬占山孤軍抗日的時候、所　的電文字字有力、句句動人、爲什麽呢、就靠託一個「眞」字、是眞的不必多説、假的縱萬語千言、亦復何用、我不敢自作聰明貢獻一個具體的方案來消滅虚僞的敎育、虚僞的時尙、我只有隨時省察自己、是否誠意待人是否事事脚踏實地、自己果然是眞不怕人家的假、倘使自己也是假、那裡可希望得到人家的眞只要多數人能從「眞」字上用功夫、纔有眞正的立國精神、</p>
<h3>參觀愛國活動成績競賽會以後（昨續）張昂千</h3>
<p>（己）繪圖方面　天夏中學之各種武器圖　以及東北慘痕　同心對外、鐵蹄下之東北（外輸爲　圈、表示日吞之意、）務本女中之日本在華租界地圖、和安之愛國故事圖掛圖丨海上牧羊、投筆從戎、代父從軍、平海殲倭、諒山之戰、爲國犠牲、嫩江之役、則徐督粤輸財助邊、萬竹之日本和中國關係、中國沿海形勢、東北四省及國貨商標參考圖資料等、私立上海小學民族之光、海山理想中的中日戰爭圖、第一實小中日兩國比較圖、（分中國與日本東三省與日本内容分面積·人口、密數·軍備·貿易五項、）新陸師範之相形之下、中日兩國軍費與敎育費之比較、（日本軍費佔百分之二七、敎育費佔百分之八·二二一、中國軍費佔百分之八七、敎育費佔百分之一·七、）均能顯示適當意義、</p>
<p>（庚）模型方面　大夏中學之血淚河山、萬竹之台灣·朝鮮·中國沿海形勢、東北四省、日本和中國關係等模型養正之石膏模型二十具　尙文之中國模型圖、（製成分省圖合拼則成全國圖）·製造極工、有相當價値、</p>
<p>（辛）標本方面　旦華校兒童搜集東北的物産、分别門類裝置玻璃管内、十分精緻、</p>
<p>（壬）其他方面　如西成之抗日表演劇丨愛國男兒木屐兒、又如西成之抗日歌曲丨抗日、同赴國難、行軍、（其中尤以抗日歌詞爲雄壯而富於興奮性、歌詞爲「心中血、手中鐵、頭可斷、肢可裂、奮鬥精神不可滅愛國的同胞們、快起來團結　如東明之抗日反省語、亦均有特色爲各校所不多覯、</p>
<p>於以見各校對於愛國活動之努力、國難中有此集會其有裨於愛國敎育、當匪淺鮮也、抑有不能已於言者、統觀該會陳列全部成績似尙有數點可資商榷、</p>
<p>（一）各校出品多敎學上之活動成績、關於行政上訓育上之活動成績特少、</p>
<p>（二）敎師作品多、而學生自製作品少、</p>
<p>（三）似多備送展覽會陳列之新成績、尙少平日之眞成績、</p>
<p>（四）大部係課内成績、課外活動成績稀少、</p>
<p>（五）缺少中日對照比較之圖表、</p>
<p>（六）特少整個其體設計活動成績、</p>
<p>（七）出品尙少採用本國原料、</p>
<p>（八）出品標籖上、大都少詳細註明使用方法及時間、</p>
<p>以上不過就一時感想所及、特提出願與重負敎育之資者、益加奮勉、更進而致力於時久實行、以完成敎育偉人之交率、若是者眞切救國之道、庶乎近已、（完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>遜淸道光年間。爲日本豊臣秀吉跋扈之時。欲思内附。以伸張其聲勢。特派專使。乘巨艦來華。貢獻方物珍玩。以求封號。朝命覲見於紫光閣。由理藩院堂官。帶領日使趨朝行覲見禮。剛及陛即俯伏叩首。侷促不安。宣宗憫焉。温諭慰勞。並不資以失儀。即派專使携册封。赴日本答禮。　封豊臣秀吉爲日本國王。當日使之覲見回旅邸也、時在初冬。汗流遍體。客有詢其内廷之威儀者。日使呐呐半晌。瞠目而答曰。屋脊見一赤面長髯。綠袍金甲之神。不自知其膝之屈也。迨聞宣諭。又恍若九天雷震。毛骨悚然。因此不克成禮焉。相傳如是。可見當日之天威。能使藩臣屈伏。盗非無因者也。</p>
<h3>錦州考略</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>今暴日已公然假剿匪爲名。由南滿線之昌圖法庫及新民一帶推進。而營口之日軍。亦由田莊台移動。與我孫德荃旅護路隊接觸。是則錦州已陷於包圍之勢。而我當軸方自爭之不暇。曾無何等正當防衛之表示。眞令人莫測高深也。或詢余以徧閲吾國輿圖。而訖不得錦州之地位爲憾者。余曰。此昔日地志家之咎。固無由辭。何怪東鄰日寇。竟視爲襄中物也。爰考其略。以諗閲者。</p>
<p>昔禹貢冀州之域。當虞舜時。分冀之東北爲幽州。商爲孤竹國。至漢。爲無慮望平二縣地。晉慕容氏置西樂郡。唐復置柳城縣。遼又置锦州。迨明。設廣寗中左右三衛。入淸。康熙四年升爲府。領州二。縣二。嗣增岫嚴城。昌圖廳。領州二。廳二。縣二。此爲錦州府治。錦縣。即無慮縣地。遼爲永樂縣。元爲錦州。明爲廣寗縣。淸康熙三年。置錦縣。四年。復隸府治。此錦州府縣遞變之大略也。</p>
<p>其地山川綿亘。醫巫閭山。在廣寗西。舜時封爲幽州之鎭。蔡珪詩。有曰「幽州北鎭高且雄。倚天萬仭蟠大東。」即指此。又遼地理志。東丹人皇王。性好讀書。購書數萬卷。置之醫閭巫山絶頂處。築其堂曰「望海」。遼之景宗亦葬此。可見其地之絶勝已。又有十三山。在錦之東。因其峯巒高矗。恰如其數。故名。木葉山。則在廣寗北。相傳有神人乘白馬。自馬孟山。浮土河而東。天女駕靑牛車。由平地松林泛潢河而下。至木葉山二水合流。相遇爲配偶。生八子。厥後族屬漸盛。分爲八部。每行軍。及春秋時祭。必用白馬靑牛。示不忘本云。此亦俗尙之有足證者。</p>
<p>徒河城在錦之西北。劉恕外紀。周惠王三十三年。齊桓公救燕。破屠河。即是。漢置縣。屬遼西郡。安帝時。改屬遼東。明一統志。徒河城在廣寗中屯衛境内。又古大人城。唐太宗征高句麗儲粟於此。唐壨高城。亦皆當時屯兵地。梳妝樓。傳蕭太后所建。今雖毁。而其遺址尙存。元之耶律楚材。字晉卿。至金末·留守於燕。太祖定燕。召見。謂太宗曰。「此人天賜我家」。遂拜中書令。卒贈太師。封廣寗王。謚以文正。此亦人物之足光史乘。而不可以弗彰焉。</p>
<h3>耶誕歌聲</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>歐西各地。耶誕節邊。均有流行之歌曲。傳諸民間。發爲頌禱。採風者不難加以搜集。藉覘俗尙焉。本篇所述。散見於英國小雜誌中。縱一鱗半爪。亦未始非應時之談助也。耶誕歌聲。以英倫爲尤多。蘇格蘭則較遜。最著者有「天使」「牧羊童」等曲。前者爲英國文學家威斯雷氏所撰。後者乃著名詩家勞蘭德氏所作。蓋皆擷取聖經事實。發爲歌詞。聲調鏗鏘。流傳甚廣。現在耶誕節邊。英國鄉巿。多有歌者。斯實前代之遺音也。</p>
<p>根勃倫地方。風俗特殊。年逢耶誕節。居民恒男女出獵。射擊飛禽走獸以爲樂。遊行之際。引吭高歌。不作異性相悦之辭。而含順時殺伐之氣。聆之不啻軍隊中之進行曲也。迨圍塲旣罷。囊載而歸。即於耶誕節夜。烹宰宴飲。以饗親友。此時歌天貺之曲。謂係耶穌所賜。且以祈明歲之福。此俗聞挪威亦有之。談者不能舉其源委。祇悉爲中世紀所流入云。</p>
<p>新大陸發現之後。北美諸地。移爲英屬。華盛頓獨倡義師。揭竿而起。西歷一七六四年。戰於蒂拉威爾。風雪正暴。砲火緊張。時適耶誕節也。華氏指揮苦戰。卒摧强敵。歸來之頃。民衆歡聚。所以慰勞者備至。其所歌All　ye　Faithful一曲。慷慨激昂。令人起舞。美國西部人民。値茲耶誕。每高歌以紀念此創造美利堅之國父也。返觀我國。倭寇日張。得有華盛頓其人者乎。我譯至此。不禁神往不已。</p>
<h3>出征</h3>
<p>— 靑年援馬團一團員</p>
<p>（八）離常州</p>
<p>十五日下午九時三刻。我們到了鎭江站。鎭江是江蘇省政府的所在地。因之在站台等候的黨政機關代表也特别多。此外各團體及各學校的男女學生們也不少。下車後受鎭江中學抗日救國會義勇軍接到他們的校舍内駐留。</p>
<p>翌晨。天還未亮。有幾位同志已經醒了。但時間尙早。晨鷄猶末歌唱。寒氣料峭逼人。我們一時没有好法子度過這可貴的光陰。呆坐了一會。幸有一位朋友提議往郊外慢跑。我們不約而同地贊成他的高見。於是。立刻就起程了。直到了南門才回來。果然。身體經這番運動以後。和暖得多了。</p>
<p>本日（十六日）鎭江各界數千人在公共體育塲開歡迎大會。我們全體均到會場。情形十分緊張。盛况不亞蘇錫常各處。會畢。整隊返鎭中校内。當午召集各部會議。詳細討論團内事宜。工作不瑕。明日或仍休息一天。十八日必可在南京了。</p>
<p>鎭中校址的位置眞好。全部建在山峰之上。空氣異常淸潔。屋後有廣大平坦的高原。設有足球塲。塲連城垣。登城遠眺。雄壯的甘露寺巍峨在前。金山寺的塔在左邊聳立雲端。右邊一條白帶。浮動着疏疏的帆影。遠遠地還有一個小島。便是焦山了。這幾處善美的景色。的確宜人之至。如果忍耐點。細心點。那末。彩雲的浮移。村家的炊烟。以及農夫「日出而作日入而息」的行止。都莫不使人贊頌。倘能在鷄唱之前觀日出。我想其味更是無窮呢。</p>
<p>在鎭江。膳食均由鎭中學生賜給。日三飱。每早吃稀飯。並有小菜佐口。午晚膳却備有飯和粥。菜有兩個。一湯一炒。十分可口。每食都是各分小菜一份。好像吃西菜一樣。飯粥却可以盡量吃飽。我們蒙他們這樣厚待。感謝莫名。</p>
<h3>黄山新稿</h3>
<p>— 韋齋</p>
<p>黄山山水甲天下。尤便于畫。古之畫家亟稱道之。明以來畫派遂有所謂黄山者。張善子大千兄弟旣以黄山派山水享大名于時。今年秋。復偕宗姪旭明及門慕泉淙吳子京遊黄山。兩閱月歸。以攝影機盡攝黄山烟巒雲海。巨石詭松。極唐宋五代以來。南北宗渲染鈎勒之妙。挾與俱東。于是黄山派若梅瞿山兄弟釋漸江石濤。變化奇肆。驚走一世之秘。皆在贐篋。善子大千之言曰。瞿山漸江得黄山之意。石濤得黄山之體。瞿山漸江擷山之靈秀。石濤窮山之變幻。畫家得山之妙者。瞿山可十之三四。漸江可十之二三。石濤可十之六比餘子則時一至焉而已。古之人寢饋偃仰于黄山數十年。而不能竭黄山之實藏。况吾儕後生。殆空手歸耳。然而善子大千之圖黄山。則刻苦深思。其意又欲于瞿山石濤之外。自闢一途轍。黄山之奇妙。天地不之秘。遊者畫者之取用。天地不之靳。子輿氏曰。舜亦人也。瞿山淸湘往矣。善子兄弟亦何可不奮發躋攀。則前所言蓋二君之謙詞也。余所見善子之圖黄山凡五。爲百步雲梯一線天。立雪臺。蓮花蓮蕊峯。文殊院蒲團松、取景用筆。戞戞獨造。皆非世俗所謂黄山派畫也。大千所圖最精者。有淸凉臺。文殊院。石笋虹。前海觀雲。皆將于本月二十五日。寗波同鄉會消寒展覽中陳列其佳處。識者自能辨之。又一幀寫立雪臺下鶴蓋松。則點染未竟事。余將以一詩乞得之。其交易殆類于道土之籠鵝。詩曰。蓋鶴松如鶴有翎。千年石化羽衣輕。高人畫裏輕舒嘯。世上爭傳子晉笙。詩不佳。遂以爲吾文之亂。</p>
<h3>睇嚮齋逞談</h3>
<p>— 甘籌</p>
<p>▲蔡元培</p>
<p>内爭有止息之象。外侮當危急之秋。蔡元培以被毆受傷聞。毆之者。大學學生也。或曰。元培。字鶴卿。一字孑民。淸季。入翰林。授編修。嘗於同官酬酢間。詆貴胄昏庸不解事。唱排滿之論。聲至激烈。語聞於掌院學士某。某以頑固著。面斥之曰。亂臣賊子。人人得而誅之。元培報以惡聲。不安於位。托疾南歸。其時鄒鎔章炳麟爲蘇報。指摘時政。不稍忌諱。元培見而大喜。日追隨於炳麟側。炳麟笑語之曰。翰林亦思造反耶。元培應曰。秀才且造反。翰林更可謀變矣。相與輾然。迨文字之獄興。鎔及炳麟皆被錮。元培因而遠避。歷法德諸邦。卽歸。共和政府已成立。膺教育部長。旋長北京大學校。聘陳獨秀胡適顧孟餘等爲教授。以改革文字爲已任。主張廢除文言。易白話體。一時顔從風而靡。林紓好爲古文詞。大恚。至訾之曰人妖。元培怒。悉其稿乃張厚載介諸某報揭布者。厚載方肄業北大。元培藉故革其名。距卒業祗半年期也。學生自由運動。亦倡于元培。元培嘗曰。政府不善。學生得糾察之。官不良。學生可戀戒之。伸張民氣之途徑。以學生一條路爲最捷。歷年學潮之澎湃。元培指導之功不可没。初未料今日之學生羣起而毆之也。昨年。政府商議民法起草事。元培以黨國元老之尊。列席與議。力持廢姓氏。廢婚姻。廢家庭。謂男女隨時隨地皆可合。不應有家庭束縛。則婚姻自廢。更何有於姓氏之别哉。李煜　起而駁之。胡漢民亦不謂然。自稱劉姥姥之吳敬恒。則無可無不可。余以民法之製。關繫國計民情綦重。爲長文刋諸天津大公報。以糾其謬。嗟乎。元培飽嘗憂患。累經世變。垂老而猶好爲高論。匪可解矣</p>

<h3>與子同仇（二二）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第五章　沙塲喋血</p>
<p>自己却撫慰山中人民。教他們休要驚慌。一面却嚴束部伍。不許騷擾民居。留心防備太陽軍來襲擊。一面又遣代表五人到Ｈ省去。和當局聲明Ｔ城變化的經過。極願和Ｈ省聯絡互助。共禦敵氛。忠淑又言各地的鬍匪潛勢力很大。他們中間雖有不肖份子。情願去做太陽的走狗。然而也有忠義之輩。知道國難臨頭。無論朝野。當一致抵禦的。不如遣人前去聯絡。也好作爲臂助。倘然我國一旦和太陽軍正式交戰。收回失地。我們便可直搗其後。爲大軍接應了。華乃强深韙其言。也卽派人出去。自己和忠淑朝夕訓練部伍。不敢懈忽。天天盼望本國出兵和太陽兵决一死戰。可是伸長了膀子。望穿了眼珠。我國只是不動聲色。一味的無抵抗。對於國防上毫無相當準備。徒然存着僥倖之心。盼望别國有來扶助我們。主張公理。但是在這個强權民界裏。公理二字只可見之字典中。實在是没有的了。宛如吃素老嫗。遇到了災難。祈求觀世音菩薩。出來保佑。一樣是夢想。而太陽軍侵掠各地的惡消息。却日有所聞。氣得二人的肚子幾乎漲破了。拔劍砍地。恨何如之。　有一天的晚上。華乃强正自酣睡。忽被一種聲音所驚動。張眼審視。只見左右入報太陽軍乘夜來襲。正在山口與我軍劇戰。請司令速去指揮。華乃强連忙披衣下坑。已聽得隱隱的砲聲。便挾了手槍和寳劍。趕緊出營。左右早牽過坐騎。華乃强躍上馬鞍。向前飛跑。不多時已至山口。只聞敵軍的機關槍聲音。密如聯珠。接一連二的大砲向這邊猛轟過來。看看自己部下已有些支持不住了。華乃强楊劍大呼莫退。退者立斬。急調步兵一營來增援。自己當先指揮。務必堅守山口。忽然一個開花大砲彈飛來。正落在身傍。炸將起來。滿擬此身已死了。突然驚醒。原來是夢。他還不相信。側着耳朶。靜聽了一回。果然没有槍砲聲音。方纔安心復睡。次日起身。見了忠淑。便將這夢告訴伊聽。忠淑道。乃强兄心神常注在敵人身上。所以有此夢了。華乃强道。夢也好。不夢也好。與子同仇。爲國殺賊。就是殺身成仁。馬革裹屍。本是我的素志。從前齊田横有土五百人。不屈於漢。誓殉國難。區區之志。竊慕於此。何况我有衆一旅。尚堪一戰呢。忠淑忠淑。我只恨我國不能同心協力。共禦外侮。或爲城下之盟。使敵人的　力愈張。以致我國國勢日弱。神洲有陸沉之痛呢。不然。我這顆頭顱甘心爲國一擲。雖死猶榮了。忠淑對着乃强微微一笑　。（完）</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>第一架留聲機　現代的世界各國的家庭中。幾乎家家都有一架留聲機。作爲娱樂的恩物。發明這留聲機的是誰。就是美國新故的大發明愛迪生氏。那時愛迪生還是一個靑年。正在試騐電話。有一天。他對着手中所持的機械放聲高唱。霎時間他却吃驚似的跳起身來。原來他的手指忽被那機械殼子上的一個小小尖頭所剌痛了。就在這一瞬之間。他悟到他的手指之所以被剌痛。是由於電話機顫動盤上的聲浪波動所致。他便自言自語地說。「卽可剌痛我的手指。那麽大可在較硬的東西上製成一個聲片。」他最初用硬紙來試騐。將電話機移在紙上。一面他做出種種的聲音。當下他更將硬紙移上。仔細的聽時。就隱隱地聽得那種種的聲音已記在紙上了。不久他便造成了第一架留聲機。那聲片是一個蠟筒。而聽筒好像是醫生所用的聽診器。那蠟筒上的聲音是說「早安。你以爲這留聲機是怎麽。」隨後是「瑪麗有一頭小羊」一支小曲。是愛迪生自己唱的。</p>

<h3>火車中</h3>
<p>— 藻芳</p>
<p>火車開了、</p>
<p>這是從ＸＸ開向ＸＸ的最後一班火車、</p>
<p>眞少有一輛三等車車廂内、只有兩個乘客、我之外、就只剩下一位女乘客了　　我們對面坐着、</p>
<p>我抬頭看她好幾次、想看得仔細些、怨車廂中燈光太過於暗淡了、又加上我又是天生兩只近視眼、可想而知我的願望是怎樣的不圓滿了、而且、我不能過於多看她　因爲我有些覺得不好意思、至於她、被我發現到的、有四次之多她呆望着我、她比我大方多了、她恐怕是個不滿二十歲的少女、穿一身入時細軟的秋裝、</p>
<p>車向前開着、因爲是穿過市街區、有時從車窗映入街面上的燈光、反到比車内燈光亮些、過一會、自然又隱滅了、</p>
<p>她到那裏去、做什麽事情、我低下頭想、一個孤身少女、有什麽緊急勾當不能等待明天、是了、她是ＸＸ站大學堂裏的女學生、不、她的樣子並不像是個學生、臺無問題、她自然有自己的事情、少是我可以猜出的、我又何必猜想她呢、她又何嘗需要我來猜想呢、</p>
<p>無意識、」我自語、</p>
<p>似乎我的猜想被她看破、似乎她在懷疑我、卑視我不是個好人——其實我並未抬頭望她、更不知她的面上有什麽表情——可是我難住了、失措了、像犯了一場大罪似的不安於位、我的頭上、身上、悄悄冐出來熱汗、身體内部有些輕癢發散、想動一動也不敢惹怕對方的猜疑、</p>
<p>車中空氣變成沉悶的了、我呼吸變成急促的了、</p>
<p>好容易車到了ＸＸＸ車站、我鬆了一口氣、想一定能有乘客上車、衝破車中的不良空氣、對我是有些宜處的、不然我的精神將不知擾亂到什麽地方、又是少有、車站上冷淸淸、除了幾盞微弱燈光和幾個站員外、一個乘客都没有、見鬼是時間太晚的原故、</p>
<p>到底没有絶望、在車將開動時、跳上來一個乘客、一個西裝少年、因爲赶車、大概跑了幾步、所以上車來急促喘着氣、他坐在距我身旁不遠的同一長凳上、</p>
<p>他没有携帶什麽東西、坐下後盡力打量暗淡車廂中的一切、最後、他的眼光落到女人身上、（這期間、他有時轉眼看幾下我、）</p>
<p>女人低下頭、</p>
<p>我打開車窗、伸頭在車外、迎頭吹來一陣秋夜的冷風、眼前是一片無邊空洞的黑暗、</p>
<p>○　○</p>
<p>擾亂、疲倦、無聊……關上車窗躺上凳子上、過一會、我朦朧的睡去了、</p>
<p>○　○</p>
<p>火車繼續向前開行、</p>
<p>○　○</p>
<p>我爲脚步聲弄醒、微微睜開眼、一對靑年男女已經坐在一處了、離奇、這事情可眞怪、但我不能睜着睛睛、事實上不允許我這樣做、所以我趕緊閉上眼、我相信我迅速的動作、没有被對方人發覺、我的心砰砰的跳、跳得有些越乎常規、有動靜了、不錯、是低聲的話話、</p>
<p>「…………」</p>

<h3>Three Nations: Britain, France, and the United States Warn Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Occupy Tientsin Station, Our Armored Train Retreats to Dakwa</p>
<p>First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Opens Yesterday, Conference Discusses Political Reform Proposals</p>
<h3>Three Nation Envoys Visit Japanese Prime Minister Inukai</h3>
<p>Delivering Respective Government Notes</p>
<p>Expressing Intent to Warn Japan</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The United States Ambassador to Japan, Forbes, visited Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi this afternoon, delivering a note from the US government. The content related to the Japanese army's suppression of bandits in the three eastern provinces. The US government expressed its opinion, stating that if the Japanese army clashes with the Chinese army, Japan will be blamed by world public opinion. The US government recalls the December 10th Council resolution and asks the Japanese government to give serious consideration to the situation in Jinzhou. Before Forbes visited Inukai Tsuyoshi, British Ambassador Lindley and French Ambassador Martel also made similar visits, delivering similar notes from the British and French governments. It is reported that the Japanese government will formally respond to the three countries within one or two days. It is also reported that Inukai gave a verbal reply to Forbes today, claiming that the Chinese government should withdraw all Chinese troops from Jinzhou to within the Guan. He also stated that the Japanese army's actions in the Jinzhou area are purely to suppress bandits and have no intention of attacking the formal Chinese army. However, if bandits gather in Jinzhou city to defend themselves, the Japanese army cannot avoid attacking Jinzhou. Although the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France expressed their intention to warn Japan, the Japanese army is still as aggressive as ever. According to news from the three eastern provinces, the Japanese army is gradually advancing, getting closer to Jinzhou. (National News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Our Delegation Considers Suing the League of Nations Again</h3>
<p>Japanese Army's Attack on Jinzhou is a Violation of Resolutions</p>
<p>Hynes Unwilling to Serve on Investigative Committee</p>
<p>(Paris) The recent actions of the Japanese army in the three eastern provinces have drawn the deep attention of the League of Nations Council. Chairman Briand met today with the Japanese representative Yoshizawa and the Chinese representative Hu Shih-tse. Since Dr. Shih Chao-chi has left Paris, Mr. Hu is currently acting as the chief representative. Mr. Hu brought to Briand's attention the threatening actions of the Japanese army towards Jinzhou, declaring that China is determined to defend Jinzhou. If the current Japanese threats are realized, Jinzhou will definitely become a problem for the League of Nations Council. It was also recently learned that Hynes, the former Director-General of Railroads in the United States during the European War, has replied to the Council that he is unwilling to accept the invitation to serve as the American member of the Liaoning investigative committee. (National News Agency Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the confirmation of members of the Manchurian investigation team and the agreement of the Chinese and Japanese governments, it is heard that China is currently carefully considering whether to appeal to the League of Nations again due to Japan's violation of Article 2 of the League of Nations resolutions and the recent resumption of hostilities. Today, League of Nations Administrative Council Chairman Briand discussed the Manchurian incident with Yoshizawa and Hu Shih-tse, who is temporarily replacing Dr. Shih. It is reported that the discussion focused on two major points: the organization of the investigation team and the situation in Jinzhou. Although the investigative committee has been proposed in Geneva, it still awaits the agreement of the Chinese and Japanese governments, and the members who have been selected to go to Manchuria to investigate have not yet fully replied. It is heard that British representative Lord Lytton has not yet expressed his willingness to undertake this trip. The Japanese army has large-scale bandit suppression operations between Fanyang and Jinzhou, which has caused great anxiety among Chinese officials. Therefore, they instructed Mr. Hu Shih-tse to report to Briand and discuss possible consequences with him. It is heard that if Japan takes any action that China considers to be contrary to Article 2 of the League of Nations resolutions, China will appeal to the League of Nations again. Article 2 of the resolutions states: "Record all necessary steps taken by both parties to avoid the situation from becoming serious, and undertake not to take any action that could lead to future war and loss of life." Chinese here believe that if the actions currently planned by Japan are implemented, they will certainly violate this article. According to Article 6 of these resolutions, this matter is still in the hands of the League of Nations. If, as a result of the Japanese army's actions, further hostilities occur, it is expected that China will immediately appeal to the League of Nations. (Reuters Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Reinforces Tianjin</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Will Arrive Within Days</p>
<p>Kashiwa Borrows Vehicles from the Railway Bureau</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military commander Kashiwa sent personnel to the Peining Railway Bureau on the 23rd with a letter, stating that there were three transport ships carrying 1,800 Japanese soldiers, 70 officers, 160 horses, and a large number of military supplies from Dalian, scheduled to arrive at Tanggu on the 24th. He intended to borrow the railway bureau's Tanggu wharf for berthing for four days and requested that three trains be prepared to transport the troops to Tianjin. The railway bureau replied that not only were there a shortage of vehicles, making it difficult to comply, but also that they had to telegraph the Ministry of Railways for approval before proceeding. Kashiwa contacted the railway bureau again on the 24th, stating that the Japanese soldiers were scheduled to arrive at Tanggu on the 26th and requested that three trains be prepared quickly to transport them to Tianjin without delay. He also inquired by telephone with the Tianjin Customs Ship Management Office whether ships with a draft of 14 feet could reach Tianjin. The office replied that ships with a draft of 12 feet could reach Tianjin during high tide. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a phone call from Tanggu, it is reported that the area is safe. There are two Japanese warships, one American warship, and two Chinese warships docked in the river. It is widely rumored that three ships from Lushun are scheduled to enter the port on the 24th, but they have not been seen arriving. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Tientsin Station Continues to be Occupied by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Our Armored Train Retreats to Dakwa Station</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Panshan and Other Areas</p>
<p>Railway Bridge at Weijiagou Station Destroyed</p>
<p>Ammunition Depot at Juliuhe Explodes</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army is not actively attacking Jinzhou. The Japanese are using the pretext of suppressing bandits, but in reality, there are no bandits to suppress. Moreover, military attachés from various countries stationed in Jinzhou are closely monitoring the Japanese army's actions, so they are somewhat apprehensive and inconvenient to openly attack. Furthermore, local militias everywhere have considerable strength and training, which is hindering the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou. The war situation outside the Guan that has been reported in Beiping yesterday and today, such as fierce fighting, are all exaggerations by treacherous people with ulterior motives. According to a telegram from Jinzhou, at 10:20 a.m. on the 24th, a Japanese plane reconnoitered Panshan, dropped one bomb, and fired several machine gun rounds, causing no casualties. At 10:50 a.m., it flew back to Yingkou. At 11:30 a.m., a Japanese plane reconnoitered Da Ling River for half an hour before flying away. In the afternoon at 2:00 p.m., Japanese troops attacked the East Station of Tientsin, then occupied it and cut the telegraph wires. Our armored train retreated to Dakwa Station. The 602nd passenger train departing from Goubangzi arrived at Tientsin at noon on the 24th. It was heavily fired upon by Japanese soldiers before entering the station and retreated to Yingkou. The railway bureau's water tower and No. 318 railway bridge at Weijiagou, north of Tientsin, were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A self-proclaimed Commander Cai of the National Salvation Army is training militia in Lijiawopu, Haicheng County. Last night, 400 to 500 Japanese troops suddenly arrived. Cai gathered 500 to 600 militiamen to stop the Japanese army's advance. The two sides opened fire. This morning, a self-proclaimed Commander Xiang in Panshan heard the news and led 400 to 500 militiamen to assist Cai. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the morning of the 22nd, more than 500 Japanese soldiers, accompanied by eight field guns, were discovered 60 li east of Huangtukanzhi, Tientsin, and engaged in fierce fighting with the garrison. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Someone from Tientsin said that in the Majiaping area of Tuonan, there are more than 200 bandits who have been bought off by the Japanese, receiving monthly salaries and issued uniforms, etc., to assist in attacking us. Recently, Japanese people in Dalian have ordered clothing stores to make 30,000 sets of white clothing and hats before the 23rd for use when attacking Jinzhou on the 25th of this month, as there is a lot of snow in Jinzhou, to use as camouflage. It is rumored that the Japanese army is scheduled to launch a general attack on Goubangzi on the 24th. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou Telegram: This morning, our armored car at Tientsin is still fiercely resisting the Japanese army. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou Telegram: Yesterday, Japanese troops launched a fierce attack on Tientsin. Our armored car resisted alone. This morning, the Japanese side sent reinforcements, and the fierce fighting has not stopped. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a Jinzhou telegram: (1) At 4:00 p.m. on the 23rd, the kerosene tank in the Japanese soldiers' room at Juliuhe Station overturned and caught fire, and the ammunition depot was breached and exploded. At that time, the Japanese soldiers, fearing that the news would leak, cut off the telegraph and telephone lines. Subsequently, two trains of Japanese soldiers from Xinmin went to put out the fire, which was extinguished at 8:00 p.m. At 10:00 p.m., the wires were repaired. (2) Five to six hundred Japanese soldiers occupied Tientsin Township market at 5:00 p.m. on the 23rd. That night, five to six hundred members of the township regiment surrounded the Japanese soldiers and engaged in a night of mixed warfare. More than half of the Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. At dawn on the 24th, both sides ran out of ammunition. The remaining Japanese soldiers broke through the siege and retreated outside the town. More than a dozen cannons were abandoned in the town. It is expected that the Japanese army will retaliate, and the town will inevitably suffer significant losses. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The streets of Tientsin have been occupied by Japanese troops. On the 24th, Japanese troops advanced to the station again. After 2:00 p.m., the station's telephone was disconnected. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Security is Tightened Again in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Security in the Japanese concession was tightened again on the 24th. Chinese people in the concession began to relocate again. Japanese soldiers erected two machine guns on Shoushan Street, installed a new electric fence along the river in the Japanese concession, and piled up an earthen embankment next to the Tongqing Tea Garden. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Twenty-three Japanese soldiers stationed in Tianjin, fully armed, took the seventh train to Shanhaiguan at 9:30 a.m. on the 24th. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese soldiers erected two steel cannons at the west entrance of Furong Street on the evening of the 24th. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Passengers on the Peining Railway Break Through Japanese Arrests</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Today, the 101st train from Yuguan to Xinmin was suddenly intercepted by Japanese soldiers, who arrested dozens of passengers on the train for unknown reasons. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Peining Railway east of the Liuhugou Station is closed to traffic due to the Japanese army's westward advance. From today onwards, eastbound trains will only run to Liuhugou Station. (Special Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Honjo's Absurd Statement</h3>
<p>Using Banditry as an Excuse to Attack Jinzhou</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Fleets Ordered to Deploy</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Honjo Command issued a statement explaining the Japanese army's bandit suppression war, stating that the unofficial troops and bandits in southern Manchuria have been very active recently, and their scope and power have been expanding daily. Those west of the Liao River are mostly vehicles of the Liao River. The Japanese Imperial Army had previously stopped the westward attack to peacefully resolve the banditry. Unexpectedly, the Northeast Border Defense Army's police force bandits, even the Jinzhou army, a total of 100,000 people, were scattered in the vast area southwest of the Liao River and gradually moved east, disturbing the Japanese army's transportation lines. There is a risk of attack at all points. The Japanese army has been patient, but if this harmful activity is allowed to continue for a long time, the peace and order of southern Manchuria will be destroyed. Therefore, the Japanese army has decided to engage in the elimination of these unwanted crowds west of the Liao River. If any party hopes to hinder the suppression of bandits, we will not hesitate to eliminate this resistance, regardless of who is responsible. The Japanese military authorities spokesman said today that the bandit suppression work at Fakumen has been completed and the mixed brigade responsible for bandit suppression will return to Tieling tomorrow. Honjo's statement did not mention the limits of the bandit suppression west of the Liao River, and the spokesman did not mention this at all. It is the intention of the public that in Honjo's statement, the Chinese defense forces in Jinzhou are placed among the unwanted elements in Manchuria, which is very noteworthy.

<p>(Tokyo) Although the Japanese army that has been attacking bandits north of Shenyang for a week is now retreating along the southern Manchurian line, the remaining Japanese troops are still active west of the Liao River. The Japanese troops threatening the Chinese army in Jinzhou show no signs of retreating. Military intelligence is continuously being sent to the Tokyo Foreign Ministry from Shenyang and other parts of the three eastern provinces. Although warnings from the League of Nations and the US government are expected, they are still brazenly unbridled. They even claimed that the Foreign Ministry should warn China to restrain its troops stationed in Jinzhou. The Japanese army does not want to attack Jinzhou, but if the Chinese army interferes with the Japanese army's actions to suppress bandits and scattered soldiers, the Japanese army will attack them as well. It can be seen that it is extremely absurd. Although there is talk here that the Japanese army has been recalled for the second time, it seems to have originated from news from Kaiyuan. The Japanese army at Xitongjiangkou has been withdrawn to the South Manchurian Railway area because the bandit suppression has ended. Another Japanese army has also returned to Tieling Fakumen. The Japanese army is expected to return to the South Manchurian Railway line this afternoon. In view of the urgent situation in Jinzhou, the Navy Ministry submitted a proposal to the cabinet yesterday and obtained approval from the Emperor to dispatch a coastal defense ship and an aircraft carrier ship from Sasebo this morning to Lushun. Also, the 15th Destroyer Squadron and a special service boat in the Wu Naval Port have been ordered to prepare to set sail for China. Naval landing forces in Sasebo, Yokosuka, and Wu Naval Ports have also been ordered to prepare to be deployed to China, indicating that the ominous clouds of a major battle in Jinzhou have not dissipated. (National News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the deteriorating state of Jinzhou, the Japanese Navy issued an order last night to the coastal defense ship Izumo and the transport ship Notoro, which were waiting in the Sasebo Naval Port, to deploy.</p>
<p>The two ships are scheduled to depart from Sasebo for Lushun this morning, with Notoro fully loaded with aircraft. Regarding the deployment of the above two ships, after Navy Minister Osumi reported to the Cabinet, Chief of Staff Taniguchi entered the palace last night to request imperial approval.

<p>(Moscow) Today, Moscow authorities denied rumors from Britain, Japan, China, and other places that the director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau had agreed to cede the southern section of the railway to Japan or the South Manchurian Railway, stating that they were completely untrue. They also denied that Soviet Russia was willing to sell any part of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan, stating that the Russian government or the board of directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway had never discussed this matter. They also denied the claim that Japan is currently buying up shares of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Today, the Soviet Russian Communist Party's newspaper Pravda claimed that the United States supports Japan's occupation of the three eastern provinces, intending to prevent Japan from investing in the Chinese mainland again and to intensify Japanese-Russian relations in order to weaken Japan. (National News Agency Dispatch, 23rd)</p>

(Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Wu Zhihui's Telegram to Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Center Committee member Wu Zhihui sent the following telegram to Zhang Xueliang on the 24th: "To Mr. Hanqing: Abiding by the non-war covenant without wavering is perhaps the only way to reject direct negotiations. This is the correct path. However, in a world where the weak are prey to the strong, it is self-defeating to rely on justice and reason. Not fighting in Shenyang is worse than not blocking the pass like Duke Xiang of Song. Failure to resist will be blamed for losing soldiers and territory, a public crime deserves punishment. The people are wise, what more can be said? Your Excellency has long been suspected by the people of being pro-Japanese. The scolding of the past was widely believed to be a foreshadowing for today's Puyi. It was only after the loss of your father that the truth came to light. However, public opinion has never thoroughly investigated the perpetrators. Why? Because at that time, his position was like outside of civilization, unlike today where attention is paid to every inch of land. Your Excellency again did not measure your strength and capabilities, building the Peining Railway, developing a large-scale military industry, and rushing to attack the enemy, which only provoked their fear. All this, as Mr. Feng Yong said, resisting only invites disaster. Finally, being partial to friends and taking occasional pleasures and luxuries cannot be forgiven by the public. Merit and demerit can offset each other. A public crime deserves punishment, what more can the people say? Currently, you are not accepted by the bandit-like Japanese pirates, nor are you tolerated by the national traitors. Resisting fiercely in Jinzhou, a desperate gamble, what is there to wait for? The art of war says, those who are sorrowful will surely win. Han Guangdi and Ma Zhanshan are both devoted to life and death with Your Excellency. East of the Liao River, there are many brave men. Furthermore, the youth of the whole country will be your rearguard. Since ancient times, there is no one who does not die, nor is there a country that does not perish, what is there to hesitate about? Everyone desires goodness, who is not like me? If Zhang Xueliang does not fight in Shenyang but resists in Jinzhou, then Briand's non-resistance to Article 12 of the covenant or even using Article 16 of the covenant as resistance will also maintain his status as a founder of the League of Nations. Otherwise, the Japanese say that China will withdraw from the League of Nations, what is that? Our China should independently support the League of Nations in the future and become a true League of Nations. I beg to inform the League of Nations committee members who are currently in a predicament that they should withdraw themselves, that is also the correct path. Contributing a broken smile, your younger brother Wu Jingheng bows." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan and Others Propose to Select Elite Troops and Defend Jinzhou to the Death</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan submitted a proposal to the First Plenary Session requesting the selection of 100,000 elite troops to defend Jinzhou to the death in order to save the nation from peril. The co-signers included Ju Zheng, Wang Faqin, Qin Zhen, Xiong Kewu, Shi Qingyang, Deng Jiayan, Zou Lu, Zhu Jiqing, Li Liejun, Zhao Pilian, Fu Rulin, Xue Dubi, Huang Fusheng, Cheng Qian, and Chen Jiayou. The original proposal was as follows: Regarding the matter of the proposal, Japan's use of force to occupy our three eastern provinces, its display of strength and violence, and its contempt for our national sovereignty and international justice have reached their extreme. The occurrence of this major unfortunate incident has shocked the world and terrified people, causing humanity to feel apprehensive and insecure. Everyone is working together to find ways to suppress and restrain Japan, making it fear the wrath of the public and understand that the principles of justice and righteousness cannot be extinguished. However, more than a month has passed since the incident occurred, and the League of Nations has held several discussions. The result is merely the dispatch of an investigation team, using delaying tactics to urge us to negotiate directly with Japan in order to shirk responsibility. The reasons for the failure are twofold: first, we have historically been unfamiliar with Japan's strategies and steps toward us, failing to prevent problems before they occur or eliminate them invisibly; second, we have not understood the attitudes of various countries toward us and Japan, failing to use clever diplomatic maneuvers to our advantage in international affairs. "Weak nations have no diplomacy" is a fallacious statement of self-pity and self-consolation. When diplomacy is in a position of isolation and helplessness, even if a nation is strong, its diplomacy will inevitably fail. This time's incident in the eastern provinces is directly our fault, but also Japan's fault. It is fitting that we still cannot achieve victory and repeat past mistakes. Now, Japan's ambition has not died, and it is pressing forward step by step. Its calculated intention is to annex all of our eastern provinces and swallow all of Eastern Mongolia before it is satisfied. At this critical moment of survival, if we do not take appropriate measures, the collapse of several provinces in North China is a cause for concern. Since the League of Nations has used delaying tactics to shirk responsibility, it means that various countries are unwilling to use their power to uphold justice and restrain ambitious Japan that seeks to harm us. We should not place our hopes on seeking the extension of justice and fairness from the League of Nations. At this moment of survival, we must sacrifice for national sovereignty and territory, fight for the common good of humanity, and shed blood for the continuation of our nation. Where righteousness lies, we cannot be indecisive or slow, and we must not adopt a policy of non-resistance, retreating and yielding to bring about our own destruction. Since Japan has already occupied our territory by force, even if we are unwilling to lightly declare war, we should adopt a policy of iron and blood, firmly defending our position, preventing the Japanese army from rampaging without restraint as if entering an undefended land, gaining an inch and seeking a mile. Only then can we gradually seek our own survival. Jinzhou is an important location in the eastern provinces and a northern shield. If Jinzhou is lost again, the outer defenses will crumble, and its advance will endanger both Beijing and Tianjin and also endanger Chahar and Suiyuan. The disaster of its collapse will inevitably spread to all of North China. When Xishan and others think of this, they feel deeply disturbed. The rise and fall, survival and destruction of a nation are indeed the responsibility of politics, and the people's willingness to sacrifice and fight is the soul of the nation. If both are lacking, how can we survive? Regardless of whether the League of Nations can be relied upon, even if diplomacy leads to victory through the League of Nations, how can we maintain it in the future? At this difficult and critical time, in order to plan for the continued existence of the nation and the people, the government should quickly select 100,000 elite troops to reinforce Jinzhou. The city's survival is our survival, and the city's destruction is our destruction. We will stain the enemy's blades with our blood and bury our bones on the Great Wall to fulfill our duty as soldiers and demonstrate the spirit of our nation, exposing Japan's true face of using force to invade and occupy our territory under the walls of Jinzhou, making all countries in the world understand that Japan's contempt for international trust and its destruction of world peace, its violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and international law are insufficient to restrain its violence and ambition. When a thousand people point the finger, one will die even without illness. A strong country is certain to suffer a tragic defeat. It can serve as a lesson from the Yin Dynasty. Japan is not without enlightened individuals who will not dare to isolate themselves from humanity and become the enemy of the world. Even if various countries do not restrain them and stand idly by, our willingness to brave fire and water and face death with courage and honor, the magnificence of our national spirit, and the heroic spirit of our national soul can also inspire the world and awaken the determination of our nation to strengthen itself in the future so that the disaster of destruction can be avoided. We respectfully request a public decision regarding the reasons for saving the nation from destruction. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Humble Contribution to the First Plenary Session 丨 Reorganizing Finance (1)</h3>
<p>Finance is the source of all political measures in a country, and its relationship to the order and disorder of a country's politics is extremely important. From the perspective of finance, "finance" is one thing, and "governance" is another. Abundant "finance" still relies on proper "governance." Therefore, governance without finance leads to waste and poverty, while governance with finance does not necessarily lead to chaos. However, extreme waste will inevitably lead to people's hardship, official corruption, and political disorder. All crises of a nation arise from this.</p>
<p>When people in our country today discuss finance, they are heartbroken and believe that there is no solution, that our country is poor, the people are impoverished, the debt is high, and finance has fallen into a state of exhaustion. We believe that our country today is not without finance, but that it is without governance. It is not only without governance, but even the messy accounts that should exist are beyond investigation. So-called finance is merely intensifying the extraction of the people's flesh and blood, managing payments of receipts and expenditures and loans, distributing demands from the powerful factions, and raising war funds to prolong internal strife. There is only private finance and no national finance. The richer the individuals, the poorer the people, and the more impoverished the nation and the more disorderly the politics. Therefore, the fundamental foundation of the nation is shaken, and the people's livelihood is declining. The disorder of finance is indeed the main reason. We now synthesize the financial news from the central government and various provinces and regions scattered in the country's newspapers, and we see that the mess of our national finance has truly reached its extreme. If one says that finance is bankrupt, then our country today has truly surpassed bankruptcy. According to the financial reports of the Ministry of Finance for the 17th and 18th years, the total deficit for the fiscal year ending June 30th of the 17th year was 80 million yuan, while the total deficit for the 18th year was 110 million yuan. There was no financial report for the 19th year, but the increase in the deficit is undoubtedly certain. As far as we know, the government has issued 80 million yuan of salt revenue bonds. The situation of the annual increase of this deficit is truly as Finance Minister Song Ziwen said in his report, "The problem of the national government's annual budget deficit is a serious problem."</p>
<p>As for the situation in various provinces, according to a document submitted by the Finance Director of Anhui Province to the provincial government at the end of April this year, "The difference between income and expenditure in the 19th year of the Republic is very large. Even with the addition of funds aided by the central government, it is still not enough by 2.5 million yuan."</p>
<p>According to a Shanghai newspaper in early April this year, "Anhui's finance in the 20th year could not cover 4.7 million yuan. The actual tax revenue was only 80%, with a shortfall of about 6 million yuan." As for Zhejiang, according to a newspaper report in September this year, "The budget for the 20th year was short by 4 million yuan. The provincial property that could be mortgaged had been almost entirely mortgaged. In a hopeless situation, it was planned to mortgage the 400,000 yuan of Shaoxing land tax to the Hangzhou banking group for a loan of 300,000 yuan. The bamboo and reed business tax could originally collect 2.2 million yuan per year, but 1.5 million yuan had already been allocated for the use of the Hangzhou banking group." As for Jiangxi, according to a newspaper report in September, "The total income of the province in June was only over 10,000 yuan, while the expenditure of government funds was 300,000 yuan per month. Although the central government subsidizes 100,000 yuan per month, it is still insufficient. After Hunan cut its taxes, the monthly income suddenly decreased by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Although the central government subsidizes 200,000 yuan per month, the difference is still too great to make up. The accumulation of government expenses cannot be maintained. As for Shanxi, according to what Shang Zhen said to reporters in Beiping on February 21st this year, "The annual income of Shanxi Province is 16 million yuan, the military expenditure is 31.2 million yuan, and the government expenditure is 8 million yuan. The difference between income and expenditure is 24 million yuan." As for Henan, according to a report from the Finance Director in March this year, "Henan's land tax has been pre-collected up to the 26th year. There are 76 kinds of miscellaneous taxes in various counties and cities. The provincial treasury's income is at most 557,000 yuan per month, and the monthly expenditure requires 1.18 million yuan, with a monthly shortfall of 620,000 yuan." As for Guangdong, according to a newspaper report in April, "The actual monthly income of national tax is 1.84 million yuan, the actual provincial tax is 2.14 million yuan, while the monthly expenditure is 7.5 million yuan, with a monthly shortfall of 3.3 million yuan." As for Shanghai, according to a report from the municipal government in early March, "The budget income for the 19th year was 6.5 million yuan, and the expenditure was 7.02 million yuan, with a shortfall of over 500,000 yuan." This year, the shortfall still exceeds 500,000 yuan, so it was decided to issue 3 million yuan in public bonds in March this year. As for Tianjin, according to a newspaper report in April this year, Tianjin's finances this year are short by 1.7 million yuan. The above financial situation of various provinces and regions, although the materials are slightly outdated and the collection is not comprehensive or accurate, but by observing one aspect, one can see the whole picture. We can assert that today, the difficult financial situation in various provinces of our country only differs in degree. The monthly income is insufficient, and they can only make up for it by borrowing or increasing taxes. There is almost no province or region that can be an exception.</p>
<p>The difficult financial situation of the nation is as described above. However, examining its use, water conservancy is abandoned, resulting in this year's unprecedented floods. Transportation is blocked, and the necessary railway trunk lines cannot be laid. Education funding is overdue for a long time, and schools across the country are closing down. Industry and commerce are declining and depressed. The whole country is desolate. Compared with the construction of European and American countries, the difference is like heaven and earth. The financial difficulties are as such, and the results of construction are also like this. However, what is imposed on the people is harsh taxes, and all means of exploitation are used to the extreme. As reported by the Finance Director of Henan Province mentioned above, land tax has been collected up to the 26th year, and there are as many as 70 kinds of taxes. For example, Sichuan has many taxes, and there is no name to be established. As an excuse to repair bridges, bridge taxes are levied. Books and printed matter must also pay a passage stamp tax every time they pass through a checkpoint. Land tax has been pre-collected up to the 30th year of the Republic. In Guangdong, there is a levy on firewood tax, and in Jiangxi, there is a levy on superstition tax. All kinds of taxes are cleverly established, and unimaginable taxes and means of coercion and exploitation are used to the extreme, causing people to sell their wives and children, escape death without a place to go, and drift around seeking a way to survive. Farmers leave the fields, and workers lose their jobs. The four classes of people are not at peace in their affairs. Bandits are as numerous as hairs, and famine is frequent. Government is fiercer than a tiger. Taking every penny, the people's burden is so heavy, and their lives are so painful. However, the nation's financial difficulties still surpass bankruptcy. This is truly a paradoxical and strange phenomenon. It can be known that our country today is not without finance, but it is without governance. Our country is not truly poor, but it is because of the perverse measures in finance that it has fallen into a deep abyss of poverty and cannot be lifted out.</p>

<p>(2) The political reform plan was discussed but not yet finalized. The second general meeting will continue the discussion tomorrow. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the first formal meeting on the morning of the 24th, the reform plan of the central political system was discussed. This plan was proposed by Wu Chaochu, Sun Ke, Zou Lu, and Li Wenfan, with a total of five items. After two hours of discussion, it was decided to change the age limit for the Chairman of the National Government from 60 to 50 in the first original proposal. The second item of the original proposal was that the National Government Committee is the highest power organ of the state, and the executive and supervisory committee members of the Central Committee, the President of the Executive Yuan, and the ministers of the Executive Yuan are ex officio members. Because the number of Central Committee members in this session is too large, it is generally believed that since the National Government Committee is the highest organ of the state, the selection of personnel should be prudent and not too many, otherwise no one will be responsible for the central government. It was resolved to delete this section, and the revised proposal is as follows: (1) The Chairman of the National Government does not bear actual administrative responsibility, does not hold other public positions, and is filled by someone who is over 50 years old and is well-respected. The term of office is two years and may be re-elected. (2) The National Government Committee shall have three standing members who take turns as chairman. (3) The President of the Executive Yuan is equal to the Prime Minister of the responsible cabinet and is responsible to the National Government Committee. (4) The Legislative, Judicial, Supervisory, and Examination branches are not jointly responsible with the President of the Executive Yuan. (5) Judicial administration is changed to be under the Executive Yuan and a department is established for management. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the revision of the articles of the National Government Organization Law based on the plan to reform the political system decided by the Shanghai Conference, it was submitted for discussion at the first general meeting on the 24th. In general, the members had no major disagreements on the plan. It was not desired to add or subtract too much from the original Organization Law. However, one article in the revised articles, which stated that the executive and supervisory members of the Central Committee are ex officio members of the National Government, was considered inappropriate and still needed to be considered, or the number of National Government members would be appropriately increased. The plan has been handed over to the presidium for sorting out, and it can be passed at the second general meeting on the 25th. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The presidium of the plenary session held a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 24th to discuss the various proposals submitted by the general meeting for review. The most important of these was the drafting and revision of the National Government Organization Law, which was entrusted to Sun Ke and Yu Youren as the main drafters, based on the current Organization Law, incorporating the five items of the established outline. It was not dismissed until after 7:00 PM. It is reported that the presidium will hold another meeting on the morning of the 25th before the second general meeting to review the articles in detail and submit them to the second general meeting for discussion and approval. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>

Special municipalities and Mongolia and Tibet, which have not established provinces, are equal to provinces. (2) Before the realization of constitutional government, the National Assembly shall be an organ of public opinion, and its consent must be obtained on important matters concerning domestic and foreign affairs. (3) The National Assembly shall prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. (4) The National Assembly shall elect a number of people to be members of the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan, and the number shall be half of the members of the entire Yuan.

<h3>Predictions of Important Personnel in the New Government</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The general meeting tomorrow may pass the draft amendment to the National Government Organization Law proposed by the Shanghai Conference. The election of the chairman may be held on the evening of the 25th or the 26th. The candidates for chairman will not be limited to Lin Sen and Cai Yuanpei. The presidents of the five branches will also be elected by vote. As for the members of the National Government, some advocate for election by vote. Regarding the selection of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the members generally praise Wu Chaochu, and he seems to occupy more positions than Chen Youren. Many advocate that the Minister of Transportation should not be changed for the time being, and some suggest merging the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways because Sun Yat-sen's National Construction Plan does not have a provision for establishing a special Ministry of Railways, so merging it would save expenses. As for the Minister of Finance, the members generally recommend Sun Ke, and there are also proposals for Fu Bingchang to be the Director of Customs and Liang Hancao to be the Director of the Salt Administration. It is planned to appoint Liu Weizhi as the Deputy Minister of Finance, and another position will be filled by someone from the banking sector. The above has not yet been finalized. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Zou Lu Says the Impression of the General Meeting is Very Good</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zou Lu said that the impression of the meeting in the last three days was very good. Colleagues, with the national crisis imminent, have been mutually understanding on internal issues to show unity. If it is not an urgent matter, it can be postponed for a while, so that all energy can be concentrated on coping with the current national crisis. Regarding the issue of government personnel, it is difficult to finalize it first because the government system has not yet been passed. After the National Government Organization Law is finalized, the list of personnel can be announced. The unified government is scheduled to be announced on New Year's Day next year. Yan and Feng believe that the date of the plenary session is very urgent, so it is difficult to rush to attend. They have decided to stay in Shanxi Province for the time being to discuss all issues thoroughly. They can come to Beijing together after the plenary session is closed. Li Zongren was in Shanghai and originally planned to enter Beijing with the second batch of Guangdong members. However, because Wang Jingwei claimed to be ill in Shanghai, he needed to discuss everything nearby, so he will not come to Beijing for the time being. (Special telegram on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Student Representatives Petition the First Central Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai student delegation petitioned the First Plenary Session at 9:00 AM on the 24th. The congress appointed Central Committee members Chen Mingshu and Chen Gongbo to meet with them. Representatives from the Law School and Guanghua University stated the significance of their petition and the demands regarding the tragic incident. Chen Mingshu replied that students from various schools in Shanghai and Beijing had already been released. The transfer of students to the court was due to the presence of dangerous elements, which could not be released immediately. Regarding missing students, they were asked to investigate themselves, and the government would never kill students and try to cover up their traces. The government stated that the tragic incident was not premeditated and that there was no mastermind. If a mastermind was necessary, he (Chen) was willing to take responsibility. The government would punish the military and police for improper handling. Regarding an apology, he was willing to make one to the people in the name of the Garrison Headquarters. Regarding compensation, it could be submitted to the government for discussion. At that time, Chen Mingshu left the meeting due to other business. The representatives then requested Chen Gongbo to retrieve the body of their fellow student Yang Tongheng and send it to Shanghai. Chen said it could be done, and that the government would never oppress students again. He also hoped that students would take reasonable and effective action in the future. The representatives also raised various points of petition regarding internal affairs and diplomacy, which Chen answered thoroughly and accepted absolutely. (24th Dispatch)</p>

The representatives were dissatisfied and demanded that the presidium appoint one of the chairpersons to reply publicly. Zeng went inside and returned shortly. The representatives still insisted on seeing the presidium and knelt at the second gate of the Party Headquarters, declaring that they would begin a hunger strike immediately. Zeng was frightened and bowed in return, promising to report to the presidium immediately. After about half an hour, Zeng Zhongming brought a handwritten note from the chairperson stating that the documents submitted by the various groups had been received and would be handed over to the presidium for handling, and that a written reply would be given later.

<h3>European Reparations Conference</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be Held in The Hague in January Next Year</p>
<p>Advisory Committee Report Completed and Signed</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 23rd: The European Reparations Conference has now been decided to be held in The Hague on January 15th next year.

<p>▲ Reuters, Basel, 23rd: The Advisory Committee of the Bank for International Settlements, after a detailed investigation of Germany's financial situation and assets, has prepared a report. What it has found is that Germany will still not have the ability to repay the conditional payments under the Young Plan when the Hoover Moratorium expires next year. This committee, composed of representatives from the Allied countries and Germany, met for many days and held heated discussions. The report states that the decline in world trade has increased Germany's burden. This problem must be addressed jointly by governments, otherwise, a catastrophe will occur again. If credit is to be restored, an appropriate method must be found for all debts between countries, including reparations. The content of this report will be the basic material on which the reparations conference will be based in January.</p>

<h3>Wuhan Students Decide to Hold a General Demonstration</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the recent demonstrations by students in Beijing, the government authorities believe that communists have infiltrated them and have ordered the pacification directors and municipal governments in various places to strictly prohibit student movements. If dangerous situations are encountered, emergency measures should be taken immediately, and excuses of being unable to dissuade them after the event should not be used to perfunctorily shirk responsibility. After receiving the order, the Pacification Headquarters here immediately ordered various military and police agencies to take strict precautions and sent letters to the school authorities to follow suit. He Chengjun, the Pacification Director, also convened an expanded memorial week at the provincial government on the 21st, attended by faculty and student representatives from various schools. He gave a speech stating that students' patriotic movement should be guided by reason and should not be driven by emotion. On the negative side, they should not be induced by reactionaries, and on the positive side, they should eliminate reactionaries and consolidate the central government. He said that the Wuhan University students entering Beijing to petition were observing strict order and their speeches were extremely reasonable, which could be said to have obtained the qualifications to be followed by students across the country. He praised the Wuhan students very highly, covering all aspects. However, the facts were unexpected. On the 23rd, news suddenly came that Central University students had been killed in Beijing. The atmosphere in Wuhan academic circles suddenly became tense. National Wuhan University held a general student meeting that day and resolved fifteen proposals. The most important ones were: (1) Send telegrams to various agencies and schools across the country to support the recent capital tragedy, (2) Hold a general demonstration and propaganda by Wuhan academic circles at 9:00 AM on the 24th and hold a memorial meeting, (3) Send telegrams to convene youth students across the country, unite together, hold a general demonstration for the compatriots who died, and request the Anti-Japanese General Association of Students across the country to convene it, (4) Expand the mass movement and request the government authorities to effectively guarantee safety, (5) Demand that the government hand over the murderers who caused this tragedy and provide compensation to the families of the deceased compatriots, (6) The entire school will go on strike starting immediately, (7) Send representatives to various places across the country to make contact, (8) Request the First Plenary Session to adopt the following three points: (A) Military personnel are prohibited from being the chairman of the government, (B) People's representatives to the National Salvation Congress cannot be filled by Party members, (C) People's representatives should have the right to attend the National Crisis Conference. After the discussion, representatives were assigned to go to various schools to discuss and take consistent action. Private China University also convened an emergency meeting that evening to discuss everything. Other schools also had similar consultations. As a result, the Wuhan academic surge is high, no longer the calm it was before. It is said that He Chengjun is paying close attention to this and has ordered military and police agencies to take strict precautions. (December 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Suffering of the Disaster Victims in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>▲ The dead have numbered in the thousands</p>
<p>▲ The living are selling their wives and children</p>
<p>▲ The Relief Association is preparing work relief</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Hubei Province has suffered the most from the floods this year. Disaster victims are gathered in Wuhan. Although the authorities have taken measures to accommodate them, the relief efforts are limited due to the large number of people and the small amount of relief funds. The climate has changed from scorching summer to early autumn, from frost to ice and snow. They either die from the epidemic or starve to death, or they die from hunger or cold. In the past half year, the number of disaster victims who have died one after another has numbered in the thousands. The Hubei Flood Relief Committee recently reported from the provincial office that many disaster victims are selling their wives and children, which is pitiful but should not be encouraged. Therefore, on the 23rd, it sent letters to various military and political agencies, urging them to strictly investigate and prohibit it. The letter stated that this year's floods have caused serious disasters, and more than 100,000 disaster victims have gathered in Wuchang. Although emergency relief and pacification have been carried out, the large number of disaster victims are facing extreme hardship. Recently, there have been tragic incidents of selling wives and children, which is heartbreaking. There are also local ruffians who take advantage of the opportunity to sow discord, persuade, threaten, and intimidate, causing disaster victims to sell their wives and children out of hunger and cold. Families are broken and separated. Even if they have not suffered death, the tragic scene is unbearable to witness. Please order your subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit it, so as to prevent disaster victims from being displaced from their families. Regarding measures to relieve disaster victims, Zhu Qinglan recently visited the beach and had thorough discussions with He Chengjun and the officials in charge of relief work. It was decided to carry out relief and work relief in separate ways. Work relief has already started, but agricultural relief has not yet been organized. In order to alleviate the urgent situation, the association decided to borrow American wheat for agricultural relief to repair the dikes in various counties as a guarantee for agricultural affairs. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Wuhan office of the Disaster Relief Association's working group, requesting them to borrow and allocate the wheat and requesting them to forward it to the general association to allocate 100,000 tons of American wheat to benefit the disaster victims.

<h3>Han Fuqu Retains Wu Zhenzan</h3>
<p>▲The Ministry of Judicial Administration is Requested to Withdraw the Order for Him to Return to Beijing</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Since the Zhu Shude case occurred, several months have passed. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, yielded to the request of Zhu's younger sister, Zhu Shuxin, and twice requested the Jinan District Court to review the entire case file. He also summoned the plaintiff and defendant and dispatched personnel to conduct a joint trial. Finally, the defendants, Wang Weijun and Liu Hesheng, received approval from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to transfer the case to the Jiangning District Court for jurisdiction, where it is currently under trial. Due to the impact of this case, Liu Rongshan and Li Wenzhai, prosecutors of the Jinan District Court, were deemed negligent in handling the case by the authorities and were dismissed from their posts. The chief prosecutor, Li Changfu, was also transferred to the Shandong High Court as a prosecutor due to inadequate supervision. The inspectors, Bian Changgeng and Wu Kuiling, were dismissed and detained. Yesterday, Wu Zhenzan, President of the Shandong High Court, received an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to return to Beijing, with Li Guangyu succeeding him. It is rumored that this was also influenced by the Zhu case. Today, Han Fuqu sent a special telegram to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stating that since Wu came to Shandong as President of the High Court, for over a year, all measures taken have been appropriate, and the judiciary of Shandong Province has been put in order. It is not advisable to abruptly replace him with an inexperienced person, and he requested that the order be withdrawn. At the same time, Jiang Bocheng also telegraphed the Central Government to retain Wu. Wu also attended today's provincial government administrative meeting as usual, and his attitude was very calm (22nd).</p>
<h3>Lu Diping Goes to Fenghua to Visit Jiang</h3>
<p>▲Jiang Telegraphed, Advising Lu Not to Go</p>

All visitors are requested to be declined to avoid futile trips. Zhongzheng will not see guests. Brother need not come to Fenghua. It is hoped that you will work hard. Zhongzheng Yin." It is unknown whether Lu will be able to see Jiang on this trip.</p>
<h3>An Overview of Changes in the Japanese Cabinet (1)</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: When the reporter wrote the article "Prelude to the Cabinet's Shakeup" last month, he remembered saying that the Wakatsuki Cabinet would not last long. Not long after, unfortunately, what he said came true. The vicissitudes of officialdom here are even more credible. This records the beginning and end of the cabinet changes as follows, for the reference of those who pay attention to overseas affairs.</p>
<p>▲The Impasse of the Wakatsuki Cabinet: Wakatsuki was appointed to form a cabinet on April 14th of this year. Since taking office, the policies have been the same as before, still touting the supreme guidelines of "Fiscal economy", "No bond", "No tax increase", and "Friendly to China." However, every step taken is full of thorns. Although officials' salaries were reduced to seek austerity in the first half of the year, the Japanese industry, in the whirlpool of the world's recession, was already dying. In the end, the budget for the next year has a huge shortfall in revenue, and there is a lack of remedies, and ultimately it has no choice but to raise bonds and increase taxes to make up for it. Recently, the Shenyang Incident broke out, and the government completely succumbed to the military's authority. Diplomacy has become an ornament under the gun. With such a body full of sores, the Minsei Wakatsuki Cabinet has deeply entered an impasse.</p>
<p>▲The Reignition of the Cooperative Cabinet Theory: After Adachi issued a statement on the night of the 21st of last month, the cabinet already showed signs of shaking, but later it was uncertain and slightly calm. Unexpectedly, on the 9th of this month, when Tomita, advisor of the Minseito, and Kuhara, secretary-general of the Seiyukai, met, they established three major methods for the realization of the cooperative cabinet: "(1) Both parties, in view of the importance of the current situation, should jointly deal with this difficult situation; (2) Both parties should be sincere and establish policies to achieve national policies; (3) No matter who the order to form a cabinet falls on to either party, the selection and allocation of cabinet members should be discussed equally by the leaders of both parties." For a time, the theory of a cooperative cabinet was reignited. The status quo maintenance faction (Wakatsuki, etc.) and the cooperative faction (Adachi, etc.) in the cabinet had a head-on conflict, each with its own views. In the end, the Minsei Wakatsuki Cabinet fell into a state of internal division. Adachi visited Xiyuanji once on the 5th of this month, requesting his understanding of the cooperative cabinet plan. After that, although Adachi and others superficially adopted a wait-and-see attitude, they secretly continued their activities. On the 9th, the Tomita-Kuhara agreement was reached. On the one hand, Tomita tried his best to persuade Wakatsuki, and Adachi also had an interview with Inoue. However, the results were not achieved. On the night of the 10th, Adachi returned home halfway through the meeting of all cabinet members from his party, and immediately summoned Tomita, Yamamichi, Nakano, Nagai, Matsuda and others to report the unanimous position of the cabinet members in the meeting to maintain the status quo, and at the same time solicited everyone's opinion on the attitude that Adachi should take at present. As a result, it was decided not to abandon the previous claims and beliefs, that is, when the prime minister and others strongly demanded Adachi's resignation due to disagreements, Adachi also believed that there was no reason to resign. If Adachi's refusal to resign caused the cabinet to resign en masse, it was also an inevitable thing for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>▲The Cabinet Meeting and the Resignation En Masse Before the Collapse: At 11:00 a.m. on the 11th, the last cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence. Except for Adachi, the rest attended. During the cabinet meeting, it was proposed that all should resign if Adachi never changed his mind. At that time, a few people thought that the current cabinet had great responsibility for the current financial, economic and diplomatic difficulties and should not lightly advance or retreat, and never abandoned their status quo maintenance theory. However, in the end, the majority decided to resign en masse due to the reason that the cabinet was not unified. On the other hand, Inoue and Tanaka visited Adachi, first asking him to reflect on his own and make his own decision. If he refused to listen, they told him that the government had decided to resign en masse and urged him to submit his resignation. In the end, Adachi categorically rejected Inoue's and others' advice, and recognized that a resignation en masse was an inevitable thing. Under this internal and external attack, the Wakatsuki Cabinet had reached a situation where it could not step down without resigning en masse. In the afternoon of the 11th, Wakatsuki collected the resignations of all cabinet members. At 5:30, he visited the Emperor at the Palace Study to explain the reasons for the cabinet's resignation en masse. After leaving, he visited Makino Naifu and Suzuki Jichang in another room to explain the process of submitting the resignations, in order to seek understanding. Wakatsuki returned to the official residence at 6:00 p.m. The Wakatsuki Cabinet of the Minseito thus collapsed.</p>
<p>▲The Establishment of the Inukai Cabinet: The day after Wakatsuki submitted his resignation, the elder Xiyuanji entered Beijing from his fishing villa in Okitsu. Xiyuanji's entry into Beijing aroused a lot of suspicion at that time. In the past, whenever Japan encountered a political change, if Xiyuanji was not in Beijing when the Emperor consulted him, the imperial envoy would answer on his behalf. This time, Xiyuanji did not hesitate to enter Beijing, and all parties speculated that "According to the constitution, it should be recommended to Inukai, the president of the Seiyukai, but the public does not need to personally enter Beijing. As a result, it may be judged that the constitution is not followed due to the importance of the current situation. Here, the government has determined that the command will be issued to Wakatsuki again, and the Seiyukai has determined that the command will be issued to Inukai, but it is feared that there will be any conditions for cooperation with the Minseito." There are many opinions, and no one knows the truth. On the afternoon of the 12th, Xiyuanji arrived in Beijing, and immediately entered the palace to meet with Makino Naifu and Suzuki Jichang. They all believed that under the current situation, if Inukai was recommended to form a cabinet, special consideration should be given. Then he visited the Emperor and stated that he was considering the successor cabinet. After Xiyuanji left the palace and returned home, he summoned Inukai to his residence and asked Inukai's opinion, saying, "If the command is given to you, what kind of remedies will you have for this situation?" Inukai's answer was very abstract, saying, "I have always had a certain and unchangeable determination. I think it is not difficult to understand me if you just look at my usual behavior." As a result of the exchange of opinions between Xiyuanji and Inukai, they reached a consensus. Therefore, Xiyuanji informed Suzuki Jichang and recommended Inukai as the leader of the successor cabinet, and asked him to report to the Emperor on the same day. In the afternoon of the same day at 8:00, Inukai was summoned into the palace and received the order to organize the successor cabinet. After returning to the residence, he began to prepare for the formation of the cabinet based on the policy of organizing a single Seiyukai cabinet. Therefore, the hope of Wakatsuki's cabinet regaining the stage was completely cut off, and the Seiyukai Inukai Cabinet was completed. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Local dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Court Interrogates Xu Yabo: Xu Yabo, the former chief of the first district of the Provincial Public Security Corps on the water, was detained for suspicion of theft in the robbery case at Xu Boming's place in Xin Zhuang, involving a Xu Zi record deposit book. He was also implicated in the robbery case by Li Wenjun, the leader of the Zhuang family's slaughter and arson, and the chief of staff of Taibao Ashu (who has been shot in Zhenjiang), who confessed that he was a student of Taibao Ashu. He was arrested in Shanghai in mid-April, and after being transferred to the Special District Court, he was transferred to Songjiang by the County Court. After being interrogated by the Procuratorate, he was prosecuted by the same-level court for crimes such as Article 348 of the Criminal Law. At 9:00 a.m. today (24th), Criminal Judge Zhang and Secretary Peng arrived at the court to interrogate him. Xu Yabo hired lawyers Wang Zengxian and Lu Longxiang to defend him. Xu Yabo seemed to be ill and was supported to the court by two bailiffs. He was wearing a coat, a black wool vest, and a blue wool robe, and he looked quite haggard. After the judge asked about his name, age, and birthplace, the main points of the interrogation were whether Li Wenjun and others worshiped him as a teacher, and whether Taibao Ashu sent money to worship him as a teacher. He replied that this may be a mistake by Xu Yabo. When asked where the bank deposit book came from, Xu replied that there was a mailbox in front of my Shanghai residence, and I opened it in the box. At that time, lawyers Yuan Xilian and others saw it and can testify. When asked where the pistol at his home and the three long guns and more than 200 sets of military uniforms that were found came from, Xu replied that I was the former district chief, and there may have been some leftovers from the handover, but there should not be so many, because the residence in Minhang has always been empty, adjacent to the district, and it is inexplicable. When asked how Taibao Ashu and Li Wenjun met, he replied that he did not know them, but he knew that there were Taibao Ashu and Li Wenjun in the newspaper, and they had sent a threatening letter with a seal on it, which was handed over to the police station for safekeeping. Now, a photo is presented for examination.</p>
<p>The judge instructed that witnesses in this case should be summoned and a date should be set for further interrogation. Xu Yabo is still being held in the detention center.</p>
<p>The Lu Family in Huayang No. 10 Was Robbed: Five bandits who spoke with a Jiangbei accent suddenly came to the home of Lu Yunzhou in Huayang No. 10 outside the East Gate at midnight on the 22nd, entered and robbed, and injured the homeowner's little finger and burned his arm with foreign candles. The situation was very miserable. They escaped with the stolen goods. It is reported that the stolen jewelry, clothes, etc. are worth about 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Many Places on the Jinji Dike Have Collapsed: The Jinji Dike outside the Fengmen Gate is an important fortress for flood prevention. Over the years, it has been eroded by water and has not been repaired, resulting in the collapse of many places. If it is not repaired, the floods will be dangerous. The Construction Bureau should repair it at the request of the residents, and has prepared a plan and submitted it to the Construction Department for approval, and will start construction immediately.</p>
<p>All Middle Schools Resumed Classes Yesterday: Since the students of all middle schools in Wuxian County went on strike, it has been two weeks. After the Education Bureau and the principals of the schools persuaded the students, all students resumed classes yesterday (the 24th). In the afternoon, they continued to carry out patriotic activities, and the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was reorganized into the Student Federation by a resolution of the representative conference.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Party Affairs Disputes Have Been Resolved: The Wuxi Party affairs recently had disputes. The content was very complicated, and the cause of the disputes was that the former county executive committee member Ji Pu was unpopular and aroused resentment. Some people even tried to control and exclude dissidents, and secretly provoked all parties, which led to misunderstandings. Now, the standing committee member Li Tiping and executive committee member Hu Nianqian work hard to be open and honest with all parties. Most party members also have a deep understanding and are very willing to unite sincerely in the future and share the times. Therefore, the party affairs disputes have been completely resolved. The provincial government also sent a member Xiao to Wuxi yesterday to investigate the truth of the disputes. After receiving the news that the Wuxi County Party Department was destroyed, the Provincial Party Department resolved the following yesterday afternoon (23rd): (1) Telegram to the Provincial Government to severely punish party members Mao Junbai and others; (2) Dissolve the Party Affairs Improvement Association and all illegal organizations; (3) Instruct the Wuxi County Party Department to step up its work; (4) The Wuxi County Party Department Executive Committee member Li Pu resigns.</p>
<p>Liang Weichang Dissolves the Militia: Liang Zuodong, commander of the 5th Regiment of the 120th Brigade of the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army stationed in Wuxi, received an order from the division headquarters forwarded to the National Government Ling Jinghu Garrison Headquarters a few days ago, which said: After the three northeastern provinces of our country were occupied by the violent Japan, the patriotic people of each county have risen up to shout, run around to promote, and have organized militias, and given them military training, hoping to go to the northeast to fight the enemy. Later, for the sake of rectification, they were ordered to stop organizing and wait for reorganization. Although all places have complied with the order, there are still successive organizations. Although this kind of gathering is a patriotic act, it is considered that the recent actions have caused troubles and have other effects. Now the government has considerable methods to deal with Japan, and the organization of militias in various places is not necessary. Because they do not have considerable military knowledge, and they are all intellectuals and people with occupations, they should quickly send people to persuade those who have been organized to dissolve them quickly, and those who have not been organized should not be allowed to rise again, and they should be handled properly and reported. After receiving the order, Commander Liang immediately forwarded it to the Militia Headquarters in this county, limiting the dissolution within three days of the arrival of the document, and handling the end. By yesterday, the deadline had expired, and the army had not completed the end. Commander Liang sent personnel to carry out the dissolution of the army, and at the same time sent two platoons of soldiers from the eighth company of a battalion to station in the Mahavira Hall to suppress and prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Searching for Red Pills, Heads Broken and Bleeding: Zhu Aida, a detective from the 2nd Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside Guangfu Gate, was dismissed from his job due to his evil deeds and trafficking in opium pills. Unexpectedly, Zhu still engaged in illegal activities in secret after being dismissed. A few days ago, he was found to have six boxes of red pills on his body by detectives Gao Baosheng and others from the Police Brigade. Because Zhu refused to be searched, a mutual fight broke out, resulting in a broken head and bloodshed. He was taken to the 2nd Branch by the police on duty, transferred to the County Public Security Bureau, and sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Water and Land Police Teams Search for Ambush Bandits: In the areas along the river and sea of Tongyi, there have been traces of kidnapping bandits and salt smugglers recently. There are also many ambush bandits in the hinterland townships. At this moment, the water and land police teams are carrying out searches on separate routes. Police ships Junhe and others are assisting in blocking.</p>
<p>The County's Funds Are Exhausted: Nantong has suffered a famine this year, and tax revenue has been greatly affected. At present, political and police expenses are seriously in arrears. The Property Office has stopped borrowing money from industrial and financial circles to maintain it. The Education Bureau has only issued funds to the schools until August. The amount owed to the autonomous districts is even more.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Rural Ding Tunzhen Was Detained and Prosecuted: Zuo Gengyun, a surveyor from the China Jisheng Association, recently brought relief to the 6th District to distribute. The rural Ding of each township took it away. However, Yang Shijin, the rural Ding of Xiajia Township, has not distributed 45 bags of flour and more than 100 sets of cotton clothes and trousers that he received for many days, intending to embezzle them. Now the disaster victims in the township reported to the Jisheng Association, and the surveyor Zuo brought the police to arrest the rural Ding Yang and sent him to the Sanjiao Township Public Security Branch Office for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Troops Stationed in Siyang Severely Defeated Stock Bandits: The Li family in Beixiang, Siyang, and the Fangwei of the workshop, has recently been occupied by two stock bandits, Lin Liu and Duan Yuchun. Residents are not allowed to live in peace. Yan Zongyu, the 32nd Division stationed in the county, sent a battalion of Dong Xigeng on the 15th to suppress the bandits at dawn. The bandits resisted stubbornly in the Wei, and Dong Ying opened a mortar to bombard them. The bandits began to retreat into the Li surname house, resisting with the wall of the courtyard. Until about 8:00 a.m. today, Dong Ying adopted an encirclement formation, and at the same time sent people to set fire. The bandits dared not occupy it for a long time and fled north desperately. Dong Department followed and chased after them, killing more than 30 bandits, rescuing 35 hostages, capturing 3 bandits alive, and capturing 7 rifles, 1 pistol, and a total of 5 donkeys, mules, and livestock. The officers and soldiers also wounded a platoon leader, Li Jianping, and several soldiers. Siyang Smoker Killed Police Officers: Zheng Liangzuo, director of the 4th Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Wangji, Siyang Beixiang, banned smoking in the smoking houses in Peiyu, west of the collection, and led more than a dozen police officers to Peiyu to search for it a few days ago. Many smoking criminals such as Ju Mou were arrested and were about to be taken back for processing. Tang and others took out box guns, killed a police officer, Wang Dachang, and wounded a police officer, Zheng Zipan, and seized two box guns, one pistol and one rifle from the police officers, and detained a police officer, Zhang Yiming. The order was in chaos. Zheng, the director of the branch, fled back in embarrassment because the public was outnumbered, and reported the circumstances to the headquarters and transferred them to the county for handling.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Increasingly Strange Kidnapping Cases: In this county, the bandit forces are most fierce in the southeast two townships and the junction of the three counties of Yu, Sheng, and Feng. However, in the past, bandits only kidnapped male tickets and demanded ransom. Recently, the hands have become more and more vicious. Even delicate women and virgins have been kidnapped. If the kidnapped virgins are already engaged, they will demand ransom of hundreds or thousands of yuan depending on the wealth of the family. Those who are waiting to be married, once kidnapped, will give the woman's family hundreds of yuan and will be bandit wives forever. Recently, Tang Shiqing's daughter in the village, who is about to be married, was also kidnapped. Her family members cried bitterly and were helpless. This kind of cruel and unreasonable kidnapping case is truly a creation.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Two Ships Collide, a Bride Drowns: On the 21st night, in the West Xiaojiang, a cargo ship from Shaocheng to Linzhou and the boat of the Wu surname groom in Luomenzhen collided fiercely. The Wu surname boat was small and was broken by the collision. The groom and bride fell into the water together. After being salvaged for a long time, the groom was rescued, but the bride drowned. Today, they are negotiating with the cargo ship and suing the Shaoxing Court. Summoning the Representatives of Both Sides of the Tenancy Industry Congress: The Xiaoshan County Government summoned the representatives of the tenancy industry on the 21st to discuss the method of paying rent this year. As a result, the rent was paid according to the estimated harvest of the previous two years, but the tenants estimated it unilaterally, which was invalid.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Anhui-United States Wheat Distribution Decision: For the disaster victims in various counties in central Anhui, the central government has sent Wu Xiaoan as the director of the Anhui Central Grain Station to distribute 4,440 tons of wheat from the United States to various counties for relief. It is now reported that the distribution decision has been made: Wuwei 440 tons, Wuhu, Fanchang, Xuancheng, and Hexian each 400 tons, Hanshan and Nanling each 300 tons, Hefei, Lujiang, Chaoxian, Dangtu, Shucheng, Luan, Langxi, and Guangde each 200 tons. This batch of wheat from the United States is being transported from Wu to Fei for distribution.</p>
<h3>Luan</h3>
<p>Luan Protective Five Teams Surrendered Weapons: The county has added four protection group teams and one guerrilla team due to the suppression of the red bandits, requiring more than 200,000 yuan of money each year. Later, the county's public groups telegraphed Chief Chen, saying that the northwest villages were occupied by the communists, and it was difficult for the southeast to bear this huge amount of money. The general headquarters ordered the commander stationed in Luyu to send the 57th Division and the 46th Division on the morning of the 13th to surround the defense area of the 1234 teams and the guerrilla team in Zicheng Township, Chunshugang. The 4th team of the Date Tree Shop of the Guerrilla Team in Chunshugang resisted slightly. The guerrilla team member Cui Wenhua was killed in battle, and the remaining officers and soldiers surrendered their weapons. The 4th team, except for the team leader, Quan Liting, who led a part to escape to Taipingji, also surrendered their weapons. The 123 team surrendered their weapons without resistance. The weapons collected from the first team had been returned to the local area on the 15th, and the rest were kept for reorganization. The captured officers and soldiers have been detained temporarily outside the east, and the local government is raising money to give them money for dismissal.</p>

After Li and others disembarked, they took a small ferry prepared in advance and went directly to the public pier in the French Concession to land. Li Jishen and Zhang Huichang returned directly to their private residences, while the remaining members stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel and other places.</p>
<p>▲Li Jishen's Speech: This newspaper's reporter met with Mr. Li Jishen on the ferry this morning. According to Mr. Li, he met with Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong. Mr. Hu was weak and his blood pressure was still high. After arriving in Shanghai, I plan to meet with Mr. Li Delin first, and then decide whether to go to Beijing. I heard that Mr. Jiang has returned to Fenghua, and the situation of unification can be optimistic. I hope the public opinion circle will guide and urge him, he said.</p>
<p>▲Huang Shaoxiong's Speech: This newspaper's reporter then talked to Mr. Huang Shaoxiong. Mr. Huang said that he boarded the ship in Hong Kong. The French army invaded the border of Guizhou, which is true. Our side has planned legitimate defense. Mr. Zhang Xianghua's petition to aid Heilongjiang is highly supported by comrades in Guangdong, and we will definitely try to promote its success. I will wait in Shanghai to meet with Mr. Wang and others before going to Beijing. I have no major proposals for the First Plenary Session. It is very gratifying to the people that the Shanghai public opinion circle can strive for freedom of speech. In the future, I hope that you will be able to know everything and say everything, be the mouthpiece of the people, be the south needle of the government, and supervise and criticize it at any time, so that politics can have a bright day, he said.</p>

Directors Li Jingluo and Schmidt flew from Shanghai to Peiping on the 1st aircraft on the morning of the 13th, preparing for the maiden voyage in Peiping on the 15th and flying to Dihua. However, due to weather conditions on that day, it was postponed to 7:00 a.m. on the 20th before taking off. At 10:00, it arrived in Guihua, and at 4:30, it arrived at Ruoshuihe for accommodation. The next day (the 21st), it took off in the afternoon, and on the 22nd, it safely arrived in Dihua at 3:30 p.m. The Northwest test flight has been successful. Director Li has telegraphed to report the process of the test flight and the date of return to Shanghai. The original telegram said, "Shuangqing General Manager Xunjian, No. 1 aircraft arrived at Ruoshuihe for accommodation at 4:30 on the 20th. People and birds are unharmed. The Black City, which has been submerged for more than a thousand years, is a deserted ancient city. It took off again on the afternoon of the 21st to find the location of gasoline and the airport. On the morning of the 22nd, it added oil and continued westward. At 3:30, it arrived in Dihua. It is estimated that the distance between Ruo and Di is 4,000 kilometers, and it can be reached in three days. The Northwest people are extremely impressed by this great move and the company's enthusiasm for developing Northwest transportation. They are especially grateful for the preferential treatment of Chairman Jin. In addition to planning to stay for a few days, and then make an extreme flight to Tacheng or Yili, I should be able to return to Shanghai in early January. I humbly report, Li Jingcong Kouch, Yang.</p>

<h3>National Bond Holders Association Proceeds with Actions</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Public Bond Treasury Bill Holders Association of the Republic of China has been actively preparing. Yesterday, many people went to the association to register. News is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Enthusiastic Registration: Yesterday, over a hundred bondholders, including Yang Ji and Zhang Ziji, went to the association on Hong Kong Road to apply for registration. Their names, addresses, types of bonds, and amounts were recorded, and they joined the association to proceed with joint action.</p>
<p>▲ Declaration Issued: Yesterday, the National Public Bond Treasury Bill Holders Association of the Republic of China issued a declaration, stating: "The national public bond treasury bills are most closely and deeply related to our bondholders. Our bondholders purchased public bonds and treasury bills entirely as the most reliable investment, without speculative intent. Therefore, we did not mind the low interest rates or long terms, and happily purchased them without doubt. Although we have experienced changes in the situation and severe declines in market prices, we firmly believe that the National Government, representing the interests of the people as its premise and relieving suffering as its duty, will certainly maintain the nation's credit. Therefore, we will not sell all our bonds into the market, so as not to shake the common faith between the government and the people. Among our bondholders, there are ordinary people who rely on the principal and interest for daily needs, and schools that rely on the principal and interest for educational expenses. In addition, charitable organizations and relief agencies mostly use funds to purchase public bonds and treasury bills as a means of earning interest. Once there is a need, they will pledge the bonds to the financial sector for cash to meet urgent needs. Most importantly, the industrial and commercial sectors, out of love for the National Government, often purchase public bonds and treasury bills with idle funds and pledge the bonds to the financial sector as capital for industry and commerce. Unexpectedly, certain members of the Central Committee, representing public opinion, have proposed postponing the payment of principal and interest on public bonds and treasury bills. If this were to become a reality, the trust between the government and the people would be completely lost. The livelihoods of ordinary people who rely on principal and interest for their livelihoods would be cut off, and schools that rely on principal and interest would be immediately forced to close. Furthermore, charitable causes and disaster relief would be unable to continue. Those who use the bonds as the most reliable collateral for pledges would be forced by lenders to replace the worthless bonds with other collateral. Industrialists and businessmen who pledge the bonds would be unable to comply, resulting in a loss of credit and no access to capital. The consequences of such a situation for the nation and society are perilous. We urge all compatriots to rise up and petition the central government to reject this proposal that would harm the foundation of the nation and destroy the livelihoods of the people. As for the nation's financial problems, the government should convene a national economic conference to supervise and design a plan that will lead us from hardship to prosperity. This declaration is made for your consideration."</p>
<h3>Continued Opposition to Deferred Payment of Public Bond Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>The following are the telegrams from those who continued to oppose the postponement of the payment of bond principal and interest yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ Real Estate Association: The Shanghai Real Estate Association telegraphed the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, saying: "Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Fourth Session, First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, for your consideration. Reports indicate that certain members of the Central Committee have proposed postponing the payment of principal and interest on public bonds and treasury bills, which has caused great shock in Shanghai. We believe that the expression of mutual trust between the government and the people is that the people purchase bonds and the government pays the principal and interest accordingly. If this proposal were to be established and passed, the mutual trust between the government and the people would be lost, and the danger of disintegration would be imminent. We urgently submit this telegram and await a clear declaration to reassure the people. The Shanghai Real Estate Association respectfully bows."</p>
<p>▲ National Chamber of Commerce: In addition to issuing a declaration first, the National Chamber of Commerce Federation issued another telegram yesterday regarding the postponement of the payment of bond principal and interest, saying: "To all provincial, municipal, and county chambers of commerce: The First Plenary Session of the Central Committee has proposed postponing the payment of bond principal and interest, which is a matter of great importance. We urge everyone to petition the authorities to secure the foundation of the nation and maintain the livelihoods of the people. The National Chamber of Commerce Federation respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announces the End of the Fiscal Year According to the Gregorian Calendar</h3>
<p>▲ End of January of the Following Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement regarding the end of the fiscal year according to the Gregorian calendar, stating: "The National Government has already issued an order stipulating that the end of January of the following year is the end of the fiscal year for merchants' transactions. As the deadline is approaching, we hereby publish this announcement, urging all merchants in the city to comply."</p>
<h3>National Crisis Relief Association Telegraphes Request for Constitutional Implementation</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram to the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee</p>
<p>Ma Liang and others from the National Crisis Relief Association telegraphed all members of the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Nanjing, saying: "To all members of the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Nanjing, we telegraphed yesterday, advocating placing the party system within the scope of democracy and subjecting party members to the constraints of the rule of law. We have now read reports that Mr. Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, Zhang Zhiben, and others have proposed implementing civil rights and proceeding with constitutionalism. Their public spirit and insight into the root cause of the problem are commendable. We believe that the most important way to resolve all current disputes is to: (1) Immediately abolish all laws based on the party system that restrict the people's freedom, strictly prohibit party branches from interfering with the people's freedom, and explicitly allow the people to freely organize groups or political parties. (2) Immediately organize a people's representative body to discuss and decide on the electoral law for the constitutional convention, organize a constitutional convention, formulate a constitution, and implement constitutional government. If these two measures are implemented, the whole nation will be of one mind and will be able to exert strength externally. Now that the powerful enemy has penetrated deeply and national defense has been breached, survival is hanging by a thread. We hope that all members of the committee will promptly endorse this proposal, unanimously pass it, and implement it as soon as possible to meet the expectations of the people and save the nation from danger. May the Republic of China be fortunate. Signed: Ma Liang, Chu Fucheng, Zhao Fengchang, Wen Zongyao, Zhang Yilin, Li Genyuan, Zhang Yaozeng, Cheng Zikai, Peng Yunyi, Zhao Hengti, Tao Jiayao, Wang Yungong, Xu Yuangao, Chen Zepei, Huang Yanpei, Shi Ying, Shen Junru, Li Guozhen, Yin Ruli, Luo Jiaheng, Li Weilun, Zhang Kewei, Lin Xiqian, Huang Yongxi, Zhou Huipu, Zhao Zhengping, Chen Qitian, Liu Bai, Wu Yiting, Chen Baoshu, Gong Minyan, Wu Xiangchen, Xu Bi, Wang Hongshi, Wu Shan, Xiao Yongzhang, Li Guofeng, Guo Chunsen, Guan Jianshen, Tan Daonan, Wang Pengnian, Xie Yinbo, Li Limin, and others."</p>

<h3>Joint Proclamation by the Municipal Government and Garrison Command Banning Illegal Organizations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Command jointly issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of a joint proclamation, it has been reported that illegal organizations have recently been established in the city, declaring their establishment without authorization, taking over legally established organizations, and even resorting to violence and arbitrary disturbances. The central government has already formulated and promulgated regulations for the organization of various groups. If these regulations are not followed, there is no legal basis for such organizations. Moreover, Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and there is a mixture of good and bad elements. If such organizations are exploited by reactionary elements, accidents may occur, which would disrupt local order and affect social stability. It is the responsibility of the mayor and the commander to prevent this from happening. We hereby jointly proclaim that all illegally organized groups and their illegal actions will be strictly banned. Those who dare to violate this proclamation will be prosecuted according to law without leniency. This is for your strict compliance."</p>
<h3>Meeting Minutes of the National Goods Promotion Association</h3>
<p>Members of the YMCA, Ren Zuojun, Yao Yuxun, Zhao Huanzhang, Yang Shizhen, and others, believing that promoting national goods is the only way to achieve practical results in saving the country, organized the National Goods Promotion Association last month. Yesterday, the fourth meeting of sponsors and basic members was held at the YMCA. Ren Zuojun was elected as chairman and Zhao Huanzhang as recorder. After the chairman reported on the work, more than ten new members, including Xu Genghua and Chen Songshan, were welcomed, sworn in, and joined the association. After Xu Genghua, a member of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, gave a speech on the importance of promoting national goods, a joint resolution was made to issue an important declaration to factory owners and staff of national goods factories throughout the country. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Declaration of the National Goods Promotion Association to Factory Owners and Staff of National Goods Factories Throughout the Country: Factory owners and staff of national goods factories, if you and your wives and children do not use national goods, how can you have the face to ask your compatriots to buy your products? If compatriots buy your products, and you use your compatriots' money to make wool serge robes, Zhigong ne jackets, Western suits, and qipaos made of georgette or Indian silk for your wives and daughters, please think about whether your national goods are worth promoting and whether the money you earn should be used in this way. Although there are indeed such contradictory phenomena now, our National Goods Promotion Association will never publicize opposition to promoting national goods because of a few national goods profiteers. On the contrary, we will step up our work and sincerely persuade them in order to achieve a realization of conscience. Now, we want to ask factory owners and all staff of national goods factories throughout the country to wear national goods clothing within one month, set an example, and promote Chinese thread, silk, crepe, and coarse cloth. Then, the leak in China's economy can be repaired by a large margin. As for how to remedy the existing foreign clothing, please see the advertisement in today's local news column."</p>

<h3>Shen Junru Cares for Youth</h3>
<p>Shen Junru sent a telegram to Nanjing, saying: "To Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Jing Ziyuan in Nanjing, and to all members of the Fourth Session, First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, since May Fourth, every time there is a national humiliation, there will be a student case. The Chinese people have long been saddened by this. Unfortunately, the capital has once again repeated the same mistake, with deaths, injuries, and arrests, and the number of people is still unknown. Newspapers are full of reports, and society is full of doubts. The central government has strictly ordered the provinces and specially granted military and civilian officials the power to deal with emergencies. Thousands of miles of territory in the northeast were lost without a fight, but I have not heard of killing a single person who has harmed the country. Why are the students so unfortunate and have suffered this heavy punishment? The military and police do not resist foreign aggression but push their knives towards the youth. The government does not stop it beforehand, does not show sympathy in the face of the incident, and cannot offer a complete strategy after the fact. Under the bright sky, seeing this phenomenon, I truly feel like what kind of world is this? It is not only worthy of weeping bitterly. Education in national administration should focus on the future, and youth is especially related to the strong life of the race. How can they be arbitrarily harmed? Please propose to strongly correct this and determine the future education policy. I cannot express my urgency in this telegram. Shen Junru bows."</p>

The navy is repressively suppressing people and taking down the patriotic movement to appease Japan. If this darkness is not reformed, it cannot save it from failure. Now that the overall situation is peaceful and unified, the government will have a refresh. It is planned to initiate and convene a joint meeting of Fujianese traveling to the various Shanghai hometown groups, discuss solutions for saving Fujian, and petition the First Plenary Session of the National Government to ban military interference in politics, implement autonomy, secure the area from within, and fight back foreign aggression, in order to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>▲ Workers' General Meeting: The Cotton Textile Workers' Union of the Eighth District held a meeting of workers' representatives from the Yong An No. 2 Factory at 10:00 AM yesterday at the Party Headquarters of the Eighth District to discuss the steps to take for post-disaster arrangements.

<p>▲ Tearful Plea for Assistance: The Cotton Textile Workers' Union of the Eighth District issued a declaration yesterday, which roughly stated: All workers in the city are aware that the capitalists of the Yong An No. 2 Factory have exhausted all means of cruel oppression, exploiting our workers' blood and sweat in every possible way. Under these circumstances, the workers groan and weep, and have no way to appeal. Our request for four months' bonus is not excessive in terms of reason and morality. However, the heartless and greedy capitalists of the Yong An No. 2 Factory rejected it. In addition, the labor-capital agreement signed in August, which increased wages for piece-rate workers, has not been fulfilled. Wages for work stoppages on revolutionary commemorative days have been violated and not paid. Workers have been dismissed without reason. Our laborers are in dire straits, and can no longer tolerate it. We are implementing a voluntary slowdown. Unexpectedly, the capitalists announced a factory shutdown, disregarding our more than 7,000 workers, and directed the Security Corps to shoot and kill workers Yang Fengdi, Li Lunyin, and Jiao Yunying, among others. Zhu A'da and eight others are missing. In addition to submitting a petition to higher authorities for thorough investigation and leading a do-or-die struggle, we hereby tearfully inform all workers in the city of the detailed circumstances, hoping that they will, in the spirit of common destiny, provide real assistance to us, the weak. This declaration.</p>
<p>▲ About to Mediate: The Yong An No. 2 Factory continued to be shut down yesterday. Armed police officers from the Third Squadron of the Police Brigade were stationed in the factory. The factory gate was heavily guarded by a motorcade of armed sentries. In the evening, martial law was declared. The Municipal Executive Committee's Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau, after receiving reports from the trade union, heard that the Social Affairs Bureau would convene a mediation committee to deal with the matter according to law, so as to avoid the expansion of the dispute. As for the worker Jiao Lianying, who was shot locally, he has now died from his injuries. Li Lunyin, Yang Fengdi, and others are still being treated at the Seaside Hospital.</p>
<h3>On the Benefits of Installing Water Meters by the Waterworks Company</h3>
<p>▲ Letter to the Real Estate Association</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports: The Shanghai British Waterworks Company sent a letter to the Shanghai Real Estate Association yesterday, stating: Dear Sirs, we read in the newspaper that your association will hold a meeting to discuss the new water rate recently drafted by the Public Works Department and our company. It was also decided during the discussion of the rate that all users within the boundary should gradually install water meters. For the convenience of your association's discussion, we hereby list the benefits of installing water meters as follows: According to the provisions of the contract signed by the Public Works Department and our company in 1896, the amount of profit earned by our company is subject to limited regulations under the contract. For this reason, the price of tap water is a combination of the cost of water production, the interest payable on our company's bonds, and the statutory dividends of shareholders. Dividends are paid in taels, and the amount varies depending on the rise and fall of the exchange rate, but in general, the interest on bonds and the dividends on shares are fixed, fluctuating slightly with the exchange rate of Chinese and foreign silver. From this, it is clear that the amount of water fees is purely based on the cost of water production. The cost of water production depends on the amount of output. If we consider the whole society, the cost of the total amount of tap water output, regardless of its use, must be borne by the water fees paid by users. There are only two ways to reduce user's water fees: (1) Reduce the cost of producing each gallon of water, (2) Reduce the total output of tap water. Regarding the reduction of the cost of producing each gallon of water, after inspecting our company's entire business, the British water expert Mr. Hill declared that our company's cost of water production is extremely low. It is of little use to compress in this area. If you want to reduce the water fees paid by users, you must save the total output of tap water in order to be effective. It is well known that Shanghai tap water is wasted too much. Users who pay monthly water fees do not try to save on water usage, not to mention those who share a water supply with several households. Therefore, taps are often dilapidated, and water pipes are cracked. Repairs are delayed, and water is allowed to flow for hours without being stopped. According to our company's estimates, one-third of the total amount of water used by those who pay monthly water fees is pure waste. What is even more alarming is that in the past 25 years, the amount of water used per person per day has increased from 10 gallons to 30 gallons. If monthly water fees are changed to water meters, then 12 or 14 gallons per person per day is sufficient under water meter billing, while under monthly payment, it is not possible to exceed 30 gallons. Currently, users who pay monthly water fees account for 98% of the total, and the amount of tap water wasted is considerable. Our company firmly believes that after changing to water meters, the waste of tap water can be eliminated, and the total output of tap water can be reduced, so that users can reduce the water fees they bear. This is the main reason why our company proposes to change monthly water fees to water meters, purely for the benefit of the entire society. In recent years, landlords have often protested the impropriety of paying water fees on behalf of tenants. If a tenant evades rent, the landlord not only loses rent, but also the water fees paid on their behalf. If water meters are installed, the landlord can prepay a deposit according to the meter price (so that all users are exempt from bearing the interest on the capital to purchase water meters). Our company can install a water meter for each tenant by name. Then, our company can directly collect water fees from the tenants. The above-mentioned drawbacks will be swept away. Correspondingly inform you, I hope you will discuss it.</p>
<h3>Party Members Should Engage in Social Undertakings</h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Party Headquarters Issued a Notice</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports: The Municipal Party Headquarters issued a notice yesterday, stating: For the matter of notification, it is approved by the Central Executive Committee's Organization Department Notice No. 1236: It is found that the mission of our party lies in realizing the Three Principles of the People created by the Premier. If we truly want to complete this great mission, then all party members must exert their intelligence and talents to directly engage in social undertakings, and indirectly contribute to the party. Only then can our party gather the great strength formed by the intelligence and talents of all party members, and implement the Three Principles of the People. Recently, some party members have been ignorant of this meaning, moving only with party affairs as the sole revolutionary work, and the party headquarters as the sole revolutionary organ, almost as if there is no way to speak of revolution without party affairs, and no way to seek work without the party headquarters. The singing and harmony, the habitual neglect, has led to party personnel being everywhere, and various social undertakings have been turned aside and ignored. In general, speculative elements who hope that our party can be a tool for their personal livelihood can also sneak in, to the extreme detriment. The trend will inevitably lead to personal backwardness and failure for our party. There is no more urgent crisis than this. The Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee saw through this malady, so it specially issued an instruction, earnestly encouraging the establishment of the foundation of party members supporting the party, and not falling into the plight of the party supporting party members. At this time when internal and external troubles are intertwined, the tasks of our party are becoming more and more arduous. All of us who are currently serving party personnel should look up to the above-mentioned instructions, and do our best to implement them first, in order to set an example. A special notice is hereby issued, hoping that the association will first reduce the number of full-time staff within the association as much as possible. Those responsible or in charge of personnel who rely solely on party affairs for a living should also find a suitable job in the local area in the shortest possible time, as a basis for personal life, so that they can do their best, go deep into the people, devote themselves to the work of the party headquarters, devote themselves to social undertakings, and with the enthusiasm of loving the party and the country, come forward to do great things for themselves and others. The hope of the central government lies in this, the completion of the mission of our party lies in this, and the way to be self-reliant in the professional society after the end of political training and to avoid becoming unemployed or jobless people lies in this. The future of the party and the country depends on this, and there is much to rely on. A special notice is hereby issued, hoping that everyone will comply. Approved. In addition to Xu's separate distribution, the district party headquarters is hereby notified for information. This is a special notice.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Health Bureau Will Inspect the Physical Condition of Employees of Various Agencies</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau sent a letter to the Secretariat of the Municipal Government and various bureaus, stating: Sirs, the case of the Municipal Government and its affiliated agencies inspecting the physical condition of employees has been drafted by this bureau with rules and regulations and agreements with hospitals, and has been approved by the Municipal Government for implementation. The detailed rules for implementation and the hospital regulations have also been printed separately by this bureau. We are now sending several copies of each and several blank examination letters for the convenience of starting the examination. However, the degree of physical strength and the standard of whether or not to examine are still difficult to determine for the time being. Now, for the sake of convenience in selection, it seems that those employees who have taken continuous sick leave for more than one month or have taken sick leave more than forty-five days in several times within one year should be sent for examination first. A corresponding letter is hereby sent, hoping that you will check it.</p>
<h3>Case of Workers' Request for Year-End Bonus from China Merchants Public Bus Company</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, it was settled through mediation by party and government agencies</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports: The case of the Zhabei China Merchants Public Bus Company in this port, due to a loss of more than 12,000 yuan in this year's business, and the failure to approve the request of all workers to issue a one-month year-end bonus wage, occurred. Yesterday (the 24th), Zhou Lianze, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang Xianqing, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Gu Zhenbai, a representative of the Public Works Bureau, Liu Shouchun, a representative of the labor side, Liang Guoming, Huang Zhongwen, a representative of the capital side, Shi Tiqiu, and Jiang Shifu, a record keeper, were convened at the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, starting at 9:00 am and lasting until 4:30 pm. After six hours of debate, the representatives of the party and government agencies strongly persuaded the establishment of the following mediation records: (1) The year-end bonus for this year, in addition to the old practice of the previous year, is that each person will be given wages for 20 days, and an additional two days of wages will be given to each person. (2) The above-mentioned year-end bonus will be issued in two installments: the first installment on December 28th, and the second installment on January 20th of next year. The above was signed by both parties with consent and left the meeting.</p>

In addition to flour, the exports from Shanghai to Tianjin have also been sharply reduced, because the passengers do not dare to handle the goods.</p>

<h3>Vice President Chen Hang of the Central Bank Sues for Marriage Dispute</h3>
<p>▲ Yan Shufen's Good Fortune is Often Frustrating</p>
<p>▲ Two Times of Fate, Nothing Accomplished</p>
<p>▲ Ending the Romance, Chen Hang is Accused</p>
<p>▲ Many Celebrities Involved in the Case</p>
<p>▲ Engagement Process: Chen Hang, Vice President of the Central Bank, courtesy name Jian'an, native of Shangyu, Zhejiang, father passed away early. Chen had a clan uncle who served as an official in Henan at the end of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, a certain Yan from Yushan was also working there as a secretary, and they became friends. Later, Chen believed that Yan had a daughter named Shufen, who was studying at Jinghai School in Suzhou, and was both talented and beautiful. Therefore, he took it upon himself to be a matchmaker for his nephew Jian'an. At that time, Jian'an was studying at St. John's University in Shanghai. After Yan once observed her, he believed that she was a worthy choice. So, they got engaged, exchanged rings, and pledged their faith. Since then, Yan deeply felt that this soon-to-be son-in-law's family was poor, fearing that he would not have enough money for his studies and might drop out of school, so he often provided financial assistance to help him succeed. And this engaged couple frequently exchanged loving letters. From the beginning of the Republic of China to the sixth year, the love letters exchanged were more than enough to fill a foot-long ruler.</p>
<p>▲ Occasional Misunderstandings: However, there were occasional minor misunderstandings in between. Shufen angrily wrote to Jian'an, saying, "I will embrace spinsterhood. You might as well find another good match." However, this kind of opinion was quickly dispelled. Therefore, Shufen's subsequent letter stated that the previous statement was a joke and should not be taken seriously. But Jian'an at that time needed to rely on his future father-in-law's support. Therefore, he accepted everything that Shufen did to him without arguing, only keeping the letters carefully preserved as evidence for future negotiations.</p>
<p>▲ Studying in the United States: In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Jian'an graduated and took the Zhejiang Provincial Student Examination, ranking among the top. He was sent to study in the United States at public expense. Although it was public expense, his future father-in-law still provided financial assistance every year. In total, the money subsidized to Chen amounted to more than 25,000 yuan. After Chen went abroad to study, Shufen also graduated from Suzhou School. At that time, because her brother Yan Dunyuan was the Minister of Internal Affairs in the Beiyang Government, she moved to the old capital.</p>
<p>▲ Concluding Another Marriage: By the eighth year of the Republic of China, Jian'an actually married a Cai woman in the United States. He sent a special letter to the matchmaker Ye Shuheng, asking to dissolve the engagement with Shufen. The reason was based on a letter that Shufen had written to him when she was at Jinghai School. At that time, Shufen absolutely could not agree. In the summer of the eleventh year, Jian'an had completed his studies and returned to China, bringing his wife and children with him.</p>
<p>▲ Years Passed: Shufen then wanted to fulfill the marriage contract, but Jian'an then felt great difficulty. It was not right to welcome or refuse her, so he treated her evasively. As a result, the years passed and there was no good solution. Finally, Jian'an, knowing that it was difficult to fulfill the contract, said to Shufen, "I am grateful for your father's favor and repeated assistance, which enabled me to complete my studies and obtain a happy family. Now I must also repay you. I am very willing to help you study abroad, and I wish you will also find a happy partner like me." His words were sincere, and Shufen was also moved, but later it did not materialize for other reasons.</p>
<p>▲ Good Things Change: Jian'an at that time had been appointed as the manager of the Hankou branch of the China Mao Ye Bank. From then on, they were separated by great distances. Shufen's parents thought that their daughter was growing up and that the previous Mr. Liu had cut off all thoughts of pursuit. It was difficult to let her remain a maiden forever. At that time, Fu Rui, courtesy name Wutui, the nephew of the former Shanghai Daoyin Fu Jiang, had returned from studying in Japan. He was a handsome and talented young man, and was seeking a wife. Therefore, Chen Handi, a famous person in Beijing, and Ye Jingshen, Shufen's brother-in-law, acted as matchmakers and got Shufen engaged. However, this move was purely initiated by the Yan family, and Shufen absolutely did not agree, resulting in a sudden change when the auspicious day arrived. The marriage was not consummated, and the alliance on the San Sheng Stone was immediately broken. The speed of separation and reunion was unprecedented in the history of marriage.</p>
<p>▲ Visiting the President in Person: Since then, Shufen has lived in seclusion in her boudoir, wasting her youth. The spring flowers and autumn moon, though affectionate, were uncertain when the sword would meet the mirror again. Until the first quarter of this year, Shufen learned that Jian'an had become the Vice President of the Central Bank. And she reckoned that she was already forty-one years old. Time flies easily, and procrastination cannot be repeated. This love story needed to be ended in time. Therefore, she brought to Shanghai the love letters accumulated over the years and the engagement ring from that day. She went to the bank to visit him in person, hoping to tell him her feelings face to face. Unexpectedly, Chen turned her away.</p>
<p>▲ Claiming 100,000: Shufen, feeling that he was relying on his status as Vice President to refuse to see her, meant that the friendship of the past was all gone. She then resolutely entrusted lawyer Jiang Yiping to resort to the law, first requesting mediation, but to no avail. She then formally filed a lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendant to repay the 25,000 yuan of tuition fees paid on her behalf, and to compensate her for 100,000 yuan in damages for delaying the fulfillment of the marriage contract.</p>
<p>▲ Litigation in Court: After Chen was sued, he also hired lawyers such as Wu Jingxiong to defend him, saying that the plaintiff disliked his family's poverty and was the first to break the engagement. Later, she married Fu Wutui in Beijing. The officiator was Fu Xishen (傅燮忱), Fu Wutui's uncle, and the witnesses were Shao Zhang (邵章), former President of the Administrative Court, and Chen Handi, the matchmaker. As for tuition fees, he only received a thousand and three hundred yuan in assistance, which was a gift. After he returned to China, he also repeatedly subsidized the plaintiff's mother with 1,400 yuan, which offset the debt.</p>
<p>▲ Outcome of the Trial: During the court hearing, several people came to court to testify that Shufen had indeed married Fu Rui in Beijing. The new house was located in the Oriental Hotel. However, the new couple had a conflict immediately after entering the bridal chamber that night, and they separated that night. At that time, it spread throughout the capital and became a topic of conversation. At the end of the first trial, the plaintiff's lawsuit was dismissed.</p>
<p>▲ Appeal Opens: The plaintiff refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court opened the court to summon witnesses. Lawyer Jiang presented letters from Shao Bojiong and Fu Wutui to prove that they had not actually married. At that time, the marriage was terminated immediately because the woman was unwilling. He also presented the remaining love letters and rings to the court. Chen Jian'an did not attend. His friends Tao Changshan and Zhu Dashen came to court to testify, and what they said was the same as in the first trial. After Judge Shen questioned them, he ordered a postponement and a further review.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Works Participates in the Lawsuit Regarding the Execution of Bandits by Electric Shock</h3>
<p>▲ Due to the Bureau of Works' Own Relationship</p>
<p>▲ Lawyer Ru is Sent to Participate in the Litigation</p>
<p>▲ Ms. Lu Yin is a Formally Married Spouse</p>
<p>▲ Accomplice Denies, Reveals Comrades</p>
<p>The kidnapper Lu Qingcai (also known as Lu Er), who was arrested by detectives from the General Investigation Department of the General Patrol Room for kidnapping the Shen Sheng Da Le case, was escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation. Suddenly, he fell ill and died in prison. And Lu's wife, Yin, suddenly hired four lawyers, Jiang Bao, Zheng Wenkai, Chou Yu, and Shan Yuhua, to sue Zhou Honglin (also known as Ji Lihong), a Chinese detective of the General Investigation Department, in the First Special Court for plotting to kill her husband for money by using electric shock. The case has been summoned twice. Zhou paid a 10,000 yuan deposit and was released on bail to await interrogation. The Bureau of Works believes that this case is related to the interests of the Bureau. According to the agreement on the recovery of the Mixed Court, the Bureau can appoint a lawyer to appear in court or express its opinion in writing. It has specially appointed the legal consultant Ru Baoyi to participate in the litigation, and has submitted a detailed opinion letter to the Special Court. The most important point is that the plaintiff Lu Yin is Lu Qingcai's concubine, not a formally married spouse. According to Article 338 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Lu Yin has no right to sue. The Bureau requests that the lawsuit be dismissed and lists witnesses to prove that Zhou Honglin is not responsible for Lu Qingcai's death. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the interrogation in the Second Criminal Court. Fu Liang, Director of the Legal Department of the Bureau of Works, also attended the hearing. The lawyer representing the plaintiff immediately rose and requested a ruling on whether the lawyer of the Bureau of Works could participate in the litigation. Judge Wu instructed that according to Article 8 of the agreement, he could participate, and the court had already approved it. The official letter from the Special Court to the Bureau of Works approving the appointment of a lawyer was issued. Lawyer Shan Yuhua then said that Article 8 of the agreement stated that the Bureau of Works, when it deems necessary, may participate in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Procedure Law. This refers to civil cases, while this case belongs to criminal proceedings, and it seems impossible to participate. Judge Wu instructed that he could also participate, and the trial proceeded. Judge Wu asked the plaintiff's lawyer to respond to the point in the Bureau of Works' opinion letter that the plaintiff had no right to sue. Lawyer Chou Yu replied that the Bureau of Works' claim that the plaintiff was a concubine was not true. The plaintiff and Lu Qingcai went through formal marriage procedures, which can be proved by the plaintiff. Then, Lu Yin said that she married Lu Qingcai at the age of sixteen. The marriage location was in Changji Lane, opposite the New World, and she presented a marriage certificate to prove it. Judge Wu then recognized that Lu Yin and Lu Qingcai were a formally married couple. Then, lawyer Ru Baoyi wanted to speak out and object to the opposing lawyer, saying that the participation of the Bureau of Works could only be stated in writing, and he could not have the right to speak. Lawyer Ru replied that if he could not speak when appearing in court, why should he appear in court? The official instructed lawyer Ru that he could speak, and then brought up Chen Sanwenzi, an accomplice in the Lu Qingcai case, and asked if Lu Qingcai was the one you confessed to. Chen denied it. Then, West Detective Yashuenijiafu and Chinese Detective Tang Jian proved that Lu Qingcai was indeed confessed by Chen Sanwenzi, and Lu was also arrested by us, not by Zhou Honglin. Furthermore, Chinese detectives 1084 and 2122 proved that when searching Lu Qingcai's body, they only found a double-corner coin, seven copper coins, and two receipts from the Lao Zheng He Dyeing Workshop. Shen Shengda and his lawyer Wu Linkun also filed a case to prove that when identifying the prisoner at the police station, they recognized Lu Qingcai as the leader of the kidnappers among the crowd of criminals. Judge Wu then questioned Zhou Honglin briefly and instructed that the case be adjourned for another trial. Zhou Honglin was still released on the original bail.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Opens a Ferry to Lujiazui</h3>
<p>▲ Elderly Women at the Ferry Crossing Gather to Make Noise</p>
<p>Between Dongchang Road in Pudong and Dongmen Road in Puxi, after the new ferry line was agreed upon by the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, the docks on both sides had already been completed. Two ferry boats had also been built for many months. However, the reason why it has not been opened is because the Taikoo Company has been obstructing it. A shallow-water wheel that has been out of service for a long time is permanently docked at the Taikoo Company's Pudong Huatong No. 1 dock. The ship's hull deliberately leans out for the most part, blocking the exit of the Dongchang Road dock. It is heard that the Public Utilities Bureau has negotiated many times, but to no avail. Residents in the area of Lan Mudu in Pudong still rely on old-fashioned wooden boats for transportation to Puxi. It is extremely difficult to get on and off on both sides, so they all regard it as a dangerous road. But what reason does the Taikoo Company have to block the ferry terminal that facilitates the safe passage of the public across the river on the Dongchang Road line? The Public Utilities Bureau has not yet announced the negotiation process, so they have repeatedly inquired with the Bureau for the truth, and requested that the Taikoo Company be forced to move the wheel away as soon as possible so that the ferry can open smoothly and facilitate traffic. After receiving the report, the Bureau plans to move the Pudong side from the Dongchang Road dock to the Lujiazui dock and start operating in February or March next year. However, there was already a commercial ferry at that dock. The Puxi side was also at the Ningshao dock on Dongmen Road. The Public Utilities Bureau previously ordered the ferry to stop operating because the Dongmen Road and Dongchang Road lines were about to open, in order to avoid the danger of collisions between the two sides' ships. Now that the commercially operated ferry saw that the official ferry on Dongmen Road had not opened, it resumed operations on the nineteenth of this month. However, the Public Utilities Bureau still believed that the equipment of the commercially operated ferry was not good, and continued to consult the Public Security Bureau to order the Third District to send police to obstruct it. At the same time, it advanced the opening of the official ferry starting yesterday morning. The fare was 50 copper coins per person in the morning and evening, and 80 copper coins per person during the day, which was 30 copper coins more than the commercially operated ferry. Unexpectedly, the families of the original commercially operated ferry suddenly gathered dozens of elderly women at 8:00 yesterday morning to gather at the Lujiazui dock to make noise and prevent passengers from getting on and off, claiming that the dock was relied upon by dozens of families for their livelihood. As a result, the Public Utilities Bureau ferry temporarily stopped operating. Later, the district chief of the Third District, Zhang, arrived at the scene and instructed to solve it through proper procedures. After persuading for a long time, the women dispersed, and the ferry was able to continue operating.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of the Flood in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>▲ Report from the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association</p>
<p>Hubei Province has a low-lying terrain, so this year's disaster is the most severe of all provinces. According to statistics, there are as many as 45 counties and one city affected by the disaster, and the affected population is more than 9 million. The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, in response to the severe disaster in the province, has long entrusted the Hankou Hubei Chinese and Foreign Relief Association to handle it nearby. As of now, a total of 40,000 yuan in relief money, 5 bags of flour, 71 boxes of bread, 4 large boxes of Wan Jin Oil, 4,000 bottles of medicine, 30,000 new cotton clothes, and 50 bags of old clothes (worth more than 40,000 yuan) have been successively distributed in the most severely affected areas, such as Wuchang, Hanyang, and Xia Kou. However, the disaster area is very large, and it is like a drop in the bucket. In addition, the cold winter is approaching, and it is a matter of great anxiety that victims are starving and freezing to death every day. According to recent investigations from all parties, there are still more than 240,000 disaster victims in Wuhan, and the number of victims scattered in the outer counties is even greater. The association, due to its limited finances, although it intends to provide universal relief, suffers from a lack of strength. It still hopes that compatriots at home and abroad, each with a compassionate heart, will generously donate to save the dying victims.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai Sends Personnel to Dinghai for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>In September of this year, Dinghai County was hit by a wind and water disaster, affecting the entire township of Jintang. Because the villages in the township are located along the coast, houses collapsed, people were killed and injured, fields were flooded, and seawalls were destroyed. The losses were unspeakable. Chen Shunwu, the main committee member of the Jintang Fellow Association in Shanghai, sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow Association to raise money for disaster relief. With the Ningbo Fellow Association and the Siming Guild Hall, 5,000 yuan was allocated to purchase 523 stones of relief rice in Ningbo. Yu Jun Meitian was sent to Dinghai Jintang to verify the distribution. It is estimated that 173 stones of rice were distributed in the two townships of Jin, 250 stones of rice in the two townships of Jin Yi and Jin Er, and 100 stones of rice in Daxie Village.</p>
<h3>The Federation of Industrial Associations Submits a Document to the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>▲ Regarding the Confiscation of Meising Toothpaste in India</p>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Industrial Associations submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry regarding the confiscation of Meising Company's domestic toothpaste and other cosmetics by Indian customs, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate. The Shanghai Meising Company, a member of the Federation, stated in a letter that the company was founded in 1928 and has a factory that manufactures toothpaste, tooth powder, and various cosmetics, which are sold well in China and the South Seas Islands. Now, according to a letter from Messr Carimson C97/19Znd Cross Street Colomds of Kaling Sheng Company at No. 97 Cross Street, Xue Lang Ge, India, the toothpaste, powder, bath powder, and other goods purchased from your company were confiscated by Indian customs. The reason is that the English words "Made in China" on the container packaging of the toothpaste were too small to indicate that it was made in China, so it was confiscated. Request for relief, etc. Upon hearing this, we were very surprised. After investigation, the text used by our company is based on the Chinese "Meising Toothpaste" and the English "Meising Company", Maising's Maising's as the standard. Moreover, each piece of cargo container packaging is written in Chinese "Meising Toothpaste", "Produced by Shanghai Meising Company, a clean tooth, the only holy product", and English "Meising's Tooth Cleaning Holy Product" "Shanghai China" Dental Cream Shanghai China and other words. Whether Chinese or foreign businessmen, they know at a glance that it is Chinese goods. This time, when it was sold to India, it was suddenly detained and confiscated by the customs, which is obviously to prohibit the import of Chinese national goods by force. We request your association to forward it to the government and seriously negotiate for immediate release to maintain national goods and protect the capital. We will be very grateful, etc. Two English letters and a toothpaste and a picture are attached to the meeting. According to this, after investigating, the cosmetics such as toothpaste, powder, and bath powder produced by the company were sold to India for the first time. The Indian customs falsely stated that the English characters were too small and did not indicate that they were made in China, which was a deliberate contempt for our country's goods. Moreover, the confiscation was even more absurd. This is a cosmetic, not a prohibited item. According to the principles of trade, there is no reason for confiscation. In order to present the situation to your ministry, we respectfully request your permission to forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Indian customs according to reason, so as to facilitate sales and strengthen diplomatic relations. It will be a great benefit. We respectfully submit it to the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, etc.</p>

<h3>The County Magistrate Who Embezzled Public Funds is Arrested</h3>
<p>Jin Yuzhen, the former magistrate of Xinzheng County, Henan Province, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, 36 years old, left office in June of this year. Without waiting for the handover, he left office and entrusted You Lunwu, the head of the First Section, a native of Anhui (who had only taken office for a week), to handle the handover procedures on his behalf. Later, the successor found that Jin had embezzled more than 1,300 yuan of public funds during his tenure. He ordered You to find Jin to settle the accounts, but Jin had disappeared. The county government immediately detained You and limited the time to hand over the funds. You has been detained for five or six months, while Jin has been hiding in Shanghai. The Henan Finance Department has issued an arrest warrant. At the same time, You Lunwu sent a letter to his son You Suquan (18 years old, studying at Zhongnan Middle School in Nanjing), asking him to find Jin's whereabouts on his behalf. Until now, You's son learned that Jin was hiding at No. 13 Peifuli, Lagenna Road, French Concession, and reported it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He sent a letter to the First Special Court to sign an arrest warrant and issue it to the police station. Detective Tian Shiqing went to Jin's residence at 2:30 yesterday afternoon and arrested Jin and brought him to the police station. He was then escorted to the First Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case, saying that the defendant had embezzled public funds while serving as the magistrate of Xinzheng County and fled to Shanghai. The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a letter to your court to sign an arrest warrant. The police sent a detective to arrest him. You Suquan also stated that the defendant had not settled the accounts and his father had been detained for six months. He had repeatedly asked Jin to handle it, but he ignored him, so he reported to the Public Security Bureau to arrest him, etc. No one from the Public Security Bureau was present. When questioning Jin Yuzhen, he confessed that he did not embezzle any funds when he handed over his duties in Xinzheng. He entrusted Chief You to handle the handover because he made a mistake in the accounts. Judge Luo Renji verified the confession and instructed that the case be rescheduled and handed over to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Poor People Frozen to Death Due to the Cold Weather</h3>
<p>The weather is extremely cold, and the poor are gradually panicking, and people are freezing to death from time to time. For example, (1) the Zhi Da ship, which was sailing to Jiangbei the night before, was docked at the Datong Wharf in Nanshi. A man was found frozen to death outside the cabin. He was about 40 years old, wearing only a torn padded jacket, with only a torn quilt next to him. The ship bureau notified Lu Rongde, the chief of the sixteenth pu, to report to the local court for an autopsy. (2) A male corpse was found lying dead at the intersection of Taide Lane, Xinminli Road, Zhabei, on the night before under the severe frost. He was about 50 years old, wearing black cotton pants and trousers, which were already tattered, so he could not keep warm. Yesterday, the local security officer of the eleventh tu, Shen Xiaohe, found a letter next to the corpse, on which was written the name Rui Shanghua, as well as the Hukou certificate of the Chuzhou Public Security Bureau, on which was written the name of the attached household Gao Huanzhang, and Han Shangge, a 52-year-old worker hired at the Zunyang Street Furnace Fang in Dongguan, Chuzhou, Taiping.

<p>Zhang Hongbao, a 17-year-old woman from Shandong, was abducted from her hometown when she was 14 years old and sold to Wang Wu's brothel at No. 64 Xizilaizihuo Street, French Concession, to work as a prostitute. At the beginning of last month, she took the opportunity to escape and cohabited with Wang Haikun, a man from Yangzhou, at No. 1125 Pingyuan Road. After the woman disappeared, Wang Wu entrusted Lin Abao, a native of Ningbo, to find her, and offered a reward of 100 yuan. He had previously learned where Zhang Hongbao was living, so he gathered a group of people and forcibly dragged Zhang out. Detective Peng Zhenxuan saw it and asked about the situation. He immediately arrested Lin and brought him to the Huishan Police Station. Zhang was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Office to be taken care of. The next morning, the police sent Lin to the First Special District Court.

<h3>An Evening Conversation with Mr. Ma Xiangbo, an Elder Statesman from Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Yun Jian Liang News</p>
<p>Commentary on Domestic Politics, Foreign Affairs, and Academic Atmosphere</p>
<p>On the afternoon of December 18th, I visited the ninety-two-year-old Mr. Ma Xiangbo in Tushan Bay. Mr. Ma would grasp my hand, then release it; sometimes he was filled with resentment, other times with laughter and scolding; he would stand up and stamp his feet, then sit down and slam his hand on the table. Domestic politics, foreign affairs, the academic atmosphere - after discussing a few words about religion, on and off, in a rambling fashion, for about two and a half hours, he asked me to organize and record his thoughts and reveal his innermost feelings. He said it would be good, and I said I was willing to share his open and upright opinions with everyone, in the spirit of "those who speak are not guilty, those who hear should take warning." Here's what Mr. Ma said:</p>
<p>The success or failure of our Chinese dynasties is nothing more than a method of raising poisonous insects. The poisonous insect that bites and defeats the others becomes the emperor. Now that transportation is convenient, it's like opening the lid of a "gu" pot (a container for raising poisonous insects). If the "gu" insect cannot immediately defeat the other insects, it jumps into another "gu" pot to learn new "gu" methods, then jumps back into the original pot. The old "gu" insect, fearing defeat, becomes an emperor, a president, a grand marshal... There is also a type of "gu" that doesn't become the leader but only acts as a henchman, helping the "gu" leader to absorb the essence of all the animals in the pot, leaving them half-dead. What is a tyrant? It's someone who directly or indirectly harms the lives of the people. Our country's domestic politics are like this, corruption is everywhere. When foreign invaders come, only a very small number of people risk their lives to resist. A vast territory of ten thousand miles, yet no one cares. When people are affected by floods, only a very small number of people provide relief. The government takes absolutely no responsibility for the deaths of the people. Can this be considered a country? In the past five years, the government has plundered the people. In addition to government bonds worth 1.1 billion yuan, there are also land taxes, customs duties, unified taxes, and all sorts of exorbitant and oppressive taxes, meticulously extracting everything possible, totaling more than 3 billion yuan. Look at history. When the Yuan dynasty ruled as emperors, and the Qing dynasty ruled as emperors, these foreigners did not want the people to suffer. After ruling for over three hundred years, even with all their plundering, they didn't extract this much! This is because these two types of "gu" only jump around in small pots in East Asia, so their hearts are not so cruel, and their methods are not so vicious. Now, this "gu" has more tricks and greater abilities. After passing through the Western world, the Pacific Ocean, and climbing to the islands and continents of the Western Hemisphere, it becomes a parasite. As a result, it absorbs all the essence from its original pot. Alas, how can we animals survive? (Slams the table) One day, I was with Cai Yuanpei, passing through the Ximen area of Shanghai, and I said to him, "We have been to many countries and seen many citizens. Does any other country have citizens like these?" Mr. Cai remained silent. I said again, "The suffering of the people in the provinces is dozens of times worse than here! What about the principle of people's livelihood?" Mr. Cai shook his head.</p>
<p>I remember during the Tongzhi reign, Chinese citizens were killed in America, and our government didn't care. I said to the official in charge, "Why are you ignoring this case?" He said, "Who told them to go abroad? We are not like the barbarians, who would send troops to China over the death of a missionary." I said, "This is not the way of the barbarians, but the way of the sages of China. The Book of Documents says, 'He attacked because they killed the child,' and also, 'He sought revenge for every commoner, man or woman.' It is the responsibility of the state to protect its citizens. He would go to war for a child, let alone a missionary!" Look at the British, French, and Americans, when they come to China, they must have a base of operations, organize everything, and essentially become a hostile state. Chinese expatriates in Southeast Asian islands and other places create businesses, hold commercial power, and have a large population and vast territory. However, they lack organization and are like a heap of loose sand. Once they suffer a setback, they never recover. Is the League of Nations reliable? At a meeting in France, France secretly allied with Japan. Where is the fairness there? If one person steals something, it's robbery. If a country steals land, isn't that also robbery? In a world of robbers, shouldn't we engage in legitimate self-defense and resist with all our might? If we don't defend ourselves or resist, they will definitely use the method of "taking advantage of chaos and humiliation of the vanquished" to attack us. Alas! (Sighs)</p>
<p>During the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, a certain school was founded in Xujiahui. At that time, a certain Westerner was the headmaster, using Indian textbooks for English and very outdated mathematics. I said, "Using English is insulting to us Chinese!" He said awkwardly, "We will improve it in the future." I introduced several textbooks and teachers to help him. We Chinese are ultimately competitive. Now this university is very good. Mr. Cai advocated that students interfere in politics. This is a very new method. Now we can see the results. Isn't this a case of cause and effect? The word "student" should be worthy of its name. One should learn and then be called a student. If one doesn't learn, then one cannot be called a student. A certain university uses French for instruction. I know that their abilities are truly... Using foreigners to teach knowledge is a great waste of breath. Chinese people, after listening, ultimately don't understand very well. If Chinese is used to teach principles, the effort can be reduced by three-quarters. There is now a person named Li Mingzhong, who is very knowledgeable, much stronger than the Westerners in China. He first studied science in China but felt it was too superficial. He went to France to study for eight years, and the French admired him greatly. He is now working at the Nanjing Gulou Astronomical Observatory. If someone wants to hire him as a professor, I can guarantee that he is stronger than any foreign mathematical master, because he uses the local language to teach, making it easy for people to understand.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Hypocritical Education (Ru)</h3>
<p>The main goal of education is to cultivate each person's true abilities and guide them on how to seek the truth. However, the result of our country's education is to create a world of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>It is clearly running a school, but one insists on saying it is nurturing talent. It is clearly just a place for eating, drinking, playing, and creating vagrants, but one insists on calling it a high-level institution for academic research. It is clearly engaging in forced labor, but one insists on saying it is saving the nation. It is clear that there is nothing to do, but one insists on saying that they are stepping up their work. Such contradictory words and actions are endless.</p>
<p>The school is a small reflection of society. If the school is like this, the various aspects of society are even more spectacular. It is clearly intentional murder, but one insists on saying it was an accidental drowning. It is clearly creating illusions, but one insists on guiding the people. It is clearly oppressive extortion, but one insists on being honest and public-minded. It is clearly non-resistance, but one insists on "courtesy as a means of governing the country." If we continue to deceive each other like this, China will definitely not perish, because even if it does, we can deceive ourselves by saying, "Even if the country perishes, the hearts of the people will not die, and there is much that can be done!"</p>
<p>The biggest cause of hypocrisy is the deeply ingrained selfishness in people's hearts, and the sense of shame has not been completely eradicated. Even if one has the mindset of "all rights belong to me, all sins belong to others," one still has to superficially appease others. Therefore, the forms of competition become even more complex. A small school can have two Anti-Japanese National Salvation Associations. A special city can organize two general labor unions. With a city chamber of commerce, there is also a business transport association. With a city party headquarters, there is also a party affairs improvement association. There is even a central government, and then there are north-south political divisions. Today you issue a declaration, tomorrow I publish a notice. Every day, when I open the newspaper, I see countless true Sun Wukongs and fake Sun Wukongs arguing with Guanyin, saying black is white. Our naked eyes cannot discern who is who.</p>
<p>However, society is not blind. When Ma Zhanshan was fighting the Japanese alone, the telegrams he sent were powerful and moving. Why? Because they relied on a "true" character. If it is true, there is no need to say more. If it is false, even ten thousand words are useless. I dare not be clever and offer a concrete plan to eliminate hypocritical education and hypocritical trends. I can only constantly examine myself to see if I am sincere in treating others and whether I am down-to-earth in everything I do. If I am truly genuine, I am not afraid of others' falsehoods. If I am also false, how can I hope to receive others' truth? As long as a majority of people can put effort into the "true" character, there will be a true spirit of national establishment.</p>
<h3>After Visiting the Patriotic Activity Achievement Competition (Continued from Yesterday) Zhang Angqian</h3>
<p>(F) Drawings: Various weapon drawings from Tianxia Middle School, as well as traces of northeastern atrocities, united against foreign enemies, Northeast under iron hooves (with an outer circle indicating Japanese annexation), Wuben Girls' Middle School's map of Japanese concessions in China, and patriotic story charts of He'an: Throwing down the pen to join the army, replacing father in the army, annihilating Japanese pirates at Pinghai, the Battle of Liangshan, sacrificing for the country, the Nenjiang campaign, Xu Du supervising Guangdong and transporting wealth to aid the border, Wanzhu's relationships between Japan and China, the situation of China's coastal areas, the four northeastern provinces, and reference materials for domestic product trademarks. The Light of the Nation from the Shanghai Private Elementary School, the Sino-Japanese War in Haishan's Ideals, the Sino-Japanese comparison chart from the First Practical Elementary School (dividing China and Japan, the Three Eastern Provinces and Japan, with content divided into area, population, density, military, and trade), the comparative situation from Xinlu Normal School, and the comparison of military spending and education spending between China and Japan (Japanese military spending accounts for 27%, education spending accounts for 8.221%, Chinese military spending accounts for 87%, education spending accounts for 1.7%) all appropriately display their significance.</p>
<p>(G) Models: The Blood and Tears River and Mountains from Daxia Middle School, Wanzhu's models of Taiwan, Korea, the situation of China's coastal areas, the four northeastern provinces, and relationships between Japan and China. Yangzheng's twenty plaster models, Shangwen's Chinese model map (made by merging provincial maps to form a national map), are extremely well-made and have considerable value.</p>
<p>(H) Specimens: Children from Danhua School collected products from the Northeast, categorized and arranged them in glass tubes, which were very exquisite.</p>
<p>(I) Other aspects: such as the anti-Japanese performance play from Xicheng, the patriotic young men's clogs, and the anti-Japanese songs from Xicheng: Anti-Japanese, Going to the National Crisis Together, Marching (among which the anti-Japanese lyrics are especially heroic and inspiring, the lyrics are "Blood in the heart, Iron in the hand, The head can be cut off, The limbs can be torn, The spirit of struggle cannot be extinguished, Patriotic compatriots, rise up and unite"), and the anti-Japanese reflection words from Dongming are also unique and not commonly seen in various schools.</p>
<p>It can be seen that various schools have put in a lot of effort in patriotic activities. Having this gathering in the midst of national crisis is beneficial to patriotic education and should be significant. However, there are some things that must be said. Looking at the entire achievements displayed at the meeting, there seem to be several points that can be discussed:</p>
<p>(1) The exhibits from various schools are mostly teaching activity achievements, and there are very few administrative and moral education activity achievements.</p>
<p>(2) There are many works by teachers, but few works made by students themselves.</p>
<p>(3) It seems that there are many new achievements prepared for the exhibition, but few true achievements from normal times.</p>
<p>(4) Most are classroom achievements, and extracurricular activities are rare.</p>
<p>(5) There is a lack of comparison charts between China and Japan.</p>
<p>(6) There are very few overall activity achievements.</p>
<p>(7) There are still few products that use domestic raw materials.</p>
<p>(8) Most of the product labels lack detailed instructions on how to use them and when to use them.</p>
<p>The above are just some thoughts at the moment, and I especially want to encourage those who bear the burden of education to work harder and devote themselves to long-term implementation in order to complete the task of cultivating great educators. If so, the way to truly save the country is near completion. (End)</p>

<h3>Zhejiang's October Education Fees Can Be Issued Within the Year</h3>
<p>▲New Director Arrives in Hangzhou Today</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's finances are exhausted, and education funds have been in arrears for up to three months. With the end of the year fast approaching, schools, museums, and societies have been continuously urging the Education Department, which has had to find a way to cope. The October education fees were originally scheduled to be released in the middle of this month. However, due to the reorganization of the provincial government and the closure of the Finance and Education Departments, there was a lack of responsible persons. It is now known that the new Education Director, Chen Bulei, has already sent people to arrange his residence and is expected to arrive today. After taking office, the October funds can be released, so they can definitely be used by the end of the year.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Education Community's National Salvation Association's Propositions Regarding the Current Situation</h3>
<p>▲Organize a Genuine Public Opinion Organ</p>
<p>▲People's Representatives to Make a Fresh Start with the People</p>
<p>▲Telegraph the Central Government to Send Troops to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Hu Shuhua and others from the Shanghai Municipal Education Community's National Salvation United Association issued a declaration on the current situation yesterday, saying: "When the National Revolutionary Army first emerged from Shaoguan, all of our countrymen were filled with joy, telling each other, 'We await our savior!' The people have suffered from tyrannical rule for too long; hunger is easily satisfied with food, and thirst with drink. The people's joy is like being rescued from hanging upside down. However, since</p>
<p>▲the nation has been stabilized, our countrymen have frowned and worried, telling each other that their suffering has only deepened, like water becoming deeper and fire becoming hotter. It has been said that a deer does not choose its shade before death. The people's relationship with the government is such that if it has virtue, it is the people's choice; if it lacks virtue, it is like a dead deer. Try reading the history of the past five years, and one will understand the reasons for the sudden change in the people's mood. The ancients said, 'Heaven sees as the people see; Heaven hears as the people hear.' Even autocratic emperors knew to value public opinion. The Kuomintang should, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of 'the world is for all,' deeply repent its past mistakes and make a fresh start with the people. The country is in danger, the enemy is deep within. The overturned cart ahead serves as a warning to the carts behind. The Book of Poetry says, 'The mirror of Yin is not far off; it lies in the era of the Xia dynasty.' To allow officials to willingly become traitors who forfeit the country's lifeline for eternity is the end. If not, then they should awaken, resolutely rise up, distance the government from the people, make national affairs public to the masses, and within the shortest possible time, organize a ▲genuine public opinion organ and seek its guidance on the policies of national salvation and repelling the enemy, and the supreme plans for establishing the foundations of the nation. After consulting and agreeing, then act. 'Though only three households remain, Qin will be destroyed; a single act can revive Xia.' Who would believe that the wisdom and talent of four hundred million people could not secure the nation's destiny or establish its foundations on solid rock? The ancestors said, 'Even the words of a grasscutter or a rustic can be adopted.' How much more so when the representatives of the public opinion organ are all outstanding members of the nation? Although there are many so-called public opinion organs today, in reality, they are either manipulated by petty people seeking ▲to seize power and demand key positions, or controlled by hooligans in the background as a shortcut to personal promotion and wealth. Therefore, the more public opinion organs there are, the more hidden the genuine public opinion becomes, and the more falsehoods fill the world, making it impossible to ask about national policy. Therefore, the public opinion organ must be ▲generated by professional organizations, and the organization of professional organizations must consist of healthy members of the respective professions. The greatest among the healthy members of each profession should be selected as people's representatives, as the voice of the people, so that genuine public opinion will naturally be revealed. The officials of our government should know that China's land is so vast, China's people are so numerous, China's circumstances are so difficult, and the results of one-party rule are so bad. Therefore, the public opinion organ is not a tool for whitewashing the situation, appeasing public sentiment, but a concrete expression of making a fresh start with the people and truly implementing 'the world is for all.' This is also clear. The Book of Poetry says, 'When Heaven is about to fall, do not be complacent.' I dare to recite this to the government and the officials of the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee."</p>
<p>The association also telegraphed the Fourth Plenary Session of the First Central Committee in Nanjing, (titles omitted): "Since the loss of the Northeast, the entire country has been in grief and indignation. The students prostrated themselves and shed blood at Pan Garden upon their return. We, the members of this association, grieve for the precariousness of the nation's destiny. Now, news of Jinzhou's crisis is urgent. If Jinzhou falls, then the Northeast's shield of Shenyang will be completely lost, and the partial peace of Jiangzuo will also be impossible to maintain hereafter. We deeply believe that all of you sages gathered at the assembly will bring about the renewal of all government affairs, and we especially hope that you will promptly order the National Government to send troops to defend the country from disaster and live up to the people's expectations. Otherwise, you will have no way to face the people, and we will have no way to advise the students." Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Education Community's National Salvation United Association.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Middle School Students of this city will hold an admission memorial service for students martyred in the Beijing demonstration at 9:00 AM tomorrow (the 26th) at the Youth Propaganda Corps in Xiaoximen. Due to the small venue, it has been decided that each school will participate with a maximum of thirty people. A circular has already been sent to each school to nominate representatives to attend on time and express their condolences. The association also convened the second preparatory committee meeting for the memorial service for students martyred in the Beijing demonstration at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon at Qingxin Middle School on Lujiabang Road, Ximen. Attendees included Sun Yucai from Jingye, Huang Shishi from Shangyu, Li Bin from Huiling, Chen Yubai from Wuben, and Xiao Sizhi from Pudong. Huang Shishi from Shangzhong chaired, and Sun Yucai from Jingye recorded the minutes. Matters discussed: (1) Regarding the report that Puyi Society is unwilling to provide the venue, how should the association handle it? Resolved to send personnel to negotiate. If they still refuse to lend it, contact the Youth Propaganda Corps.

<h3>Talent Supply and Demand Information from the Vocational Guidance Institute</h3>
<p>In the midst of the national crisis, unemployment is becoming increasingly serious at the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute. The number of people registering daily is overwhelming, so the work is even busier. Currently, in order to broaden the way out and regulate the supply and demand of talent, the institute has selected those among the registrants in November who have specialized skills and rich experience, compiled a special talent recommendation list, and sent it to various industrial, commercial, administrative, and educational institutions for recruitment. If any institutions need this recommendation list, they can write to the institute to request it. Yesterday, a factory in this city entrusted the institute to find a talent who can manufacture ceramic jars for storing chemical raw materials. They must be able to manufacture and have experience to be qualified, with a generous monthly salary. Also, a large factory entrusted the institute to recruit a talent who can manufacture glycerin, who must also have manufacturing experience, with the monthly salary negotiable. A publication company in this city entrusted the institute to recruit several book and newspaper salespersons, and a tobacco company entrusted the institute to recruit 30 cigarette salespersons, without gender restrictions. Part-time work is also acceptable, with very generous commissions and excellent benefits. Those who wish to apply for the above positions can go directly to the institute at No. 80 Hualong Road for an interview.</p>

<h3>Recollections from the Tortoiseshell Ridge</h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>During the Daoguang reign of the late Qing Dynasty, at the time when Toyotomi Hideyoshi of Japan was running rampant, he desired to attach himself to China in order to expand his influence. He specially dispatched an envoy on a giant warship to China, offering local products and treasures to seek a title. The court ordered an audience in the Purple Light Pavilion. The officials of the Court of Colonial Affairs led the Japanese envoy to court to perform the audience ceremony. As soon as they reached the steps, they prostrated and kowtowed, appearing cramped and uneasy. The Emperor Xuanzong took pity on them, warmly comforted them, and did not blame them for their lack of etiquette. He immediately dispatched an envoy with a letter of investiture to Japan to reciprocate the courtesy, conferring upon Toyotomi Hideyoshi the title of King of Japan. When the Japanese envoy returned to his lodging after the audience, it was early winter, but he was covered in sweat. A guest asked him about the solemnity of the inner court. The Japanese envoy stammered for a long time, then stared and replied, "On the roof ridge, I saw a red-faced, long-bearded god in green robes and golden armor. I was unaware that my knees were bending. When I heard the imperial edict, it was as if thunder had struck from the nine heavens, and my hair stood on end. Therefore, I could not complete the ceremony." The story is told as such. It can be seen that the Heavenly Majesty of that time could make vassal ministers submit. There was a reason for this.</p>
<h3>A Brief Study of Jinzhou</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Now, the violent Japanese have openly used bandit suppression as a pretext, advancing from Changtu, Faku, and Xinmin along the South Manchurian Railway. The Japanese army in Yingkou has also moved from Tianshuangtai, contacting our Sun Dequan brigade's railway protection team. Jinzhou is now in a state of encirclement, and our leaders are too busy fighting among themselves to show any proper defensive measures. It is truly unfathomable. Someone asked me why, after reading through the maps of our country, I could not find the location of Jinzhou, which I regret. I said, "This is the fault of the geographers of the past, which cannot be excused. No wonder the Japanese pirates in the east regard it as something in their pocket." Therefore, I have studied its outline to inform the readers.</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was the domain of Jizhou in the Tribute of Yu. During the time of Emperor Shun, the northeast of Ji was divided into Youzhou. During the Shang dynasty, it was the state of Guzhu. During the Han dynasty, it was the land of Wulü and Wangping counties. During the Jin dynasty, the Murong clan established the Xile Commandery. During the Tang dynasty, Liucheng County was re-established. The Liao dynasty also established Jinzhou. During the Ming dynasty, the left, right, and center guards of Guangning were established. In the Qing dynasty, in the fourth year of the Kangxi reign, it was promoted to a prefecture, governing two prefectures and two counties. Later, Xiuyan, Yancheng, and Changtu Hall were added, governing two prefectures, two halls, and two counties. This was the location of Jinzhou Prefecture. Jin County, formerly Wulü County, was Yongle County during the Liao dynasty, Jinzhou during the Yuan dynasty, and Guangning County during the Ming dynasty. In the third year of the Kangxi reign, Jin County was established. In the fourth year, it was restored to the jurisdiction of the prefecture. This is a general outline of the changes in Jinzhou Prefecture and County.</p>
<p>The area is mountainous and has continuous rivers. Mount Yiwulü is located west of Guangning. During the time of Emperor Shun, it was designated as the town of Youzhou. Cai Gui's poem says, "The northern town of Youzhou is high and majestic, leaning against the sky, ten thousand feet, coiled in the Great East," referring to this mountain. Also, according to the Geography of the Liao Dynasty, the emperor of Dongdan loved to read books and purchased tens of thousands of volumes, placing them on the top of Mount Yiwulü, building his hall there called "Looking at the Sea." Emperor Jingzong of Liao was also buried here, which shows the beauty of the place. There is also Thirteen Mountain, located east of Jin. Because its peaks are high and upright, just like the number, it is named so. Mount Muye is located north of Guangning. According to legend, a god rode a white horse from Mount Mameng, crossed the Futu River eastward, and a goddess drove a green ox cart down from the flat pine forest and floated down the Huang River. They met at the confluence of the two rivers at Mount Muye and became husband and wife, giving birth to eight sons. Later, their clan gradually prospered and divided into eight tribes. During every military campaign and during the sacrifices in spring and autumn, they would use white horses and green oxen to show that they did not forget their roots. This also shows that the customs still have evidence.</p>
<p>The city of Tu River is located northwest of Jin. According to Liu Shu's "Outer Records," in the 33rd year of King Hui of Zhou, Duke Huan of Qi saved Yan and broke Tu River, which is this river. A county was established during the Han dynasty, belonging to the Liaoxi Commandery. During the reign of Emperor An, it was changed to belong to Liaodong. According to the Ming Dynasty's "Comprehensive Records," the city of Tu River is located within the territory of the central garrison of Guangning. Also, the ancient city of the Great Man, where Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty stored grain during his conquest of Goguryeo. The city of Tang Lumu was also a place where troops were stationed at that time. The Dressing Tower is said to have been built by Empress Xiao. Although it is now destroyed, its ruins still exist. Yelu Chucai of the Yuan dynasty, also known as Jinqing, remained in Yan during the late Jin dynasty. Emperor Taizu of the Yuan dynasty summoned him after capturing Yan, saying to Emperor Taizong, "This man is a gift from heaven to our family." He was appointed Grand Chancellor and posthumously granted the title of Grand Tutor and King of Guangning, with the posthumous name Wenzheng. This also shows that the people can bring glory to history, and this cannot be concealed.</p>
<h3>Christmas Carols</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>In various parts of Europe and the West, there are popular songs during the Christmas season that are passed down among the people and expressed in hymns. It is not difficult for those who collect customs to gather them and gain insight into customs. The contents of this article are scattered in small British magazines. Even if it is just a glimpse, it is not necessarily unhelpful in discussing the current situation. England has the most Christmas carols, while Scotland has fewer. The most famous ones are "Angels" and "Shepherd Boys." The former was written by the British writer Wesley, and the latter was written by the famous poet Rowland. They both extracted facts from the Bible and turned them into lyrics. The melodies are sonorous and widely spread. Now, during the Christmas season, there are many singers in British towns and cities. This is truly a legacy of the past.</p>
<p>The customs of the Genbolen region are unique. During the Christmas season, the residents, both men and women, always go hunting and shoot birds and animals for fun. During the procession, they sing loudly, not songs of love between the sexes, but songs containing the spirit of killing and conquest. Listening to it is like a march in the military. When the hunt is over and they return with their bags full, they cook and feast on Christmas night to entertain relatives and friends. At this time, they sing songs praising Heaven's bounty, saying that it was given by Jesus, and pray for blessings in the coming year. It is said that this custom is also found in Norway. Those who talk about it cannot cite its origins, but only know that it flowed in from the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>After the discovery of the New World, the lands of North America were transferred to British ownership. Washington alone advocated for the righteous army, raising the flag and starting a rebellion. In 1764 of the Western calendar, they fought at Dilaweier. The snowstorm was raging, and the artillery fire was intense. It was also Christmas Day. Washington directed the bitter battle and finally defeated the strong enemy. Upon his return, the people gathered to provide all kinds of comfort. The song they sang, "All ye Faithful," was full of enthusiasm and made people want to dance. The people of the American West commemorate the founding father of the United States by singing this song every Christmas. Looking back at our country, where the Japanese pirates are growing stronger every day, is there a Washington among us? As I translate this, I cannot help but be filled with longing.</p>
<h3>Going on Expedition</h3>
<p>— A Member of the Youth Aid Horse Group</p>
<p>(8) Leaving Changzhou</p>
<p>At 9:45 PM on the 15th, we arrived at Zhenjiang Station. Zhenjiang is the location of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Therefore, there were especially many representatives of party and government organs waiting on the platform. In addition, there were also many male and female students from various groups and schools. After getting off the train, we were received by the volunteer army of the Zhenjiang Middle School Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and stayed in their school buildings.</p>
<p>The next morning, it was still dark. Several comrades had already woken up, but it was still early. The morning rooster had not yet crowed, and the cold air was piercing. We didn't have a good way to spend this precious time for a while. We sat there blankly for a while. Fortunately, a friend suggested jogging slowly in the suburbs. We unanimously agreed with his insightful suggestion. So, we set off immediately. We only returned after reaching the South Gate. Sure enough, after this exercise, our bodies were much warmer.</p>
<p>Today (the 16th), thousands of people from all walks of life in Zhenjiang held a welcoming meeting at the public sports field. All of us attended the meeting. The situation was very tense. The grand occasion was no less than that of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou. After the meeting, we returned to the Zhenzhong school. We convened a meeting of various departments at noon to discuss the group's affairs in detail. The work was not flawless. We may still rest for one day tomorrow, and we will definitely be in Nanjing on the 18th.</p>
<p>The location of the Zhenzhong school site is really good. The whole building is built on top of a mountain. The air is unusually clean. There is a vast and flat plateau behind the house with a football field. The field is connected to the city walls. Looking from the city, the majestic Ganlu Temple is towering in front. The pagoda of Jinshan Temple is standing in the clouds on the left. A white belt on the right floats with sparse sails. Far away there is a small island, which is Jiaoshan. These beautiful scenery are indeed very pleasant. If you are patient and careful, then the floating of the colorful clouds, the cooking smoke of the village, and the actions of the farmers "working at sunrise and resting at sunset" will all make people praise them. If you can watch the sunrise before the rooster crows, I think the taste will be even more infinite.</p>
<p>In Zhenjiang, the meals are provided by the students of Zhenzhong, three meals a day. Every morning we eat porridge with side dishes. Lunch and dinner are served with rice and porridge. There are two dishes, one soup and one stir-fry, which are very delicious. Each meal is divided into small portions of side dishes, like eating Western food. Rice and porridge can be eaten as much as you want. We are extremely grateful for their kindness.</p>
<h3>New Drafts from Huangshan</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhai</p>
<p>The scenery of Huangshan is the best in the world, especially suitable for painting. Ancient painters praised it repeatedly. Since the Ming Dynasty, a school of painting called the Huangshan School emerged. Zhang Shanzi and his brother Daqian have already enjoyed great fame at the time for their Huangshan School landscape paintings. This autumn, they revisited Huangshan with their nephew Xuming, their student Muquan, and Zijing Wu, spending two months there. They used cameras to capture all the smoky peaks and clouds of Huangshan, the giant rocks, and the oddly shaped pines, fully grasping the subtle nuances of rendering and outlining from the Tang, Song, and Five Dynasties. They brought these back east with them. Thus, the Huangshan School, such as the brothers Mei Qushan, Shi Tao, and Jianjiang, possessed secrets of transformations so wondrous they startled the world. All were in their luggage. Shanzi and Daqian said: Qushan and Jianjiang captured the spirit of Huangshan, while Shi Tao captured the essence of Huangshan. Qushan and Jianjiang selected the ethereal beauty of the mountains, while Shi Tao exhausted the mountains' transformations. Of the painters who grasped the wonders of the mountains, Qushan captured thirty to forty percent, Jianjiang twenty to thirty percent, and Shi Tao sixty percent. The others only reached one percent at times. Ancient people slept, ate, and lived in Huangshan for decades and still could not exhaust its true treasures. How much less can we younger generations, likely returning empty-handed? However, Shanzi and Daqian's Huangshan paintings involved diligent effort and deep thought. They aimed to blaze their own trail beyond Qushan and Shi Tao. The wonders of Huangshan are not kept secret by heaven and earth. Heaven and earth do not begrudge their use by travelers and painters. Mencius said, "Shun was also a man." Qushan and Qingxiang are in the past. How can the Shanzi brothers not strive to climb higher? Therefore, what I said before must be the humility of the two gentlemen. I have seen five Huangshan paintings by Shanzi: "Hundred-Step Cloud Ladder," "A Thread of Sky," "Snow-Standing Terrace," "Lotus Peak," and "Wenshu Monastery's Cattail Pine,". The scene selection and brushwork are all unique creations, not at all what the world calls Huangshan School paintings. Daqian's most exquisite paintings include "Qingliang Terrace," "Wenshu Monastery," "Stone Bamboo Shoots and Rainbow," and "Cloud Watching at the Front Sea," all of which will be displayed at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's winter exhibition on the twenty-fifth of this month. Knowledgeable people will be able to distinguish their excellence. There is also a painting of "Crane Canopy Pine below Snow-Standing Terrace," but the finishing touches are not yet complete. I intend to obtain it with a poem. The transaction is almost like a Daoist priest's caged goose. The poem says: "The Crane Canopy Pine is like a crane with plumage, / Millennial stone transformed into light feathered clothes. / A noble man whistles softly within the painting, / The world competes to spread tales of Ziqiao's flute." The poem is not good, so I have muddled my writing.</p>
<h3>Idle Chat at the Di Xiang Study</h3>
<p>— Gan Chou</p>
<p>▲ Cai Yuanpei</p>
<p>Internal strife shows signs of ceasing. External insults are in a time of crisis. It is heard that Cai Yuanpei was beaten and injured. Those who beat him were university students. Some say: Yuanpei, courtesy name Heqing, also known as Jiemin, entered the Hanlin Academy in the late Qing Dynasty and was appointed a compiler. During social gatherings with colleagues, he often criticized the arrogance and ignorance of the nobility, advocating for anti-Manchu theories with intense fervor. These words reached a certain Academician of the Court, who was known for his obstinacy. The Academician rebuked him, saying: "Rebellious subjects and traitorous sons, everyone has the right to punish them." Yuanpei responded with harsh words, felt uneasy in his position, and feigned illness to return south. At that time, Zou Rong and Zhang Binglin were publishing the *Su Bao*, criticizing current affairs without the slightest reservation. Yuanpei was overjoyed upon seeing this and followed Binglin closely every day. Binglin smiled and said to him: "Does a Hanlin scholar also think of rebelling?" Yuanpei replied: "Even a scholar can rebel, much more can a Hanlin scholar plot a change." They laughed together. When the literary inquisition arose, Rong and Binglin were both imprisoned. Yuanpei, therefore, avoided the situation by fleeing to various countries in Europe. Upon his return, the Republican government had already been established. He was appointed Minister of Education and then President of Peking University. He hired Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, Gu Mengyu, and others as professors, taking it upon himself to reform the written language. He advocated for the abolition of classical Chinese and the adoption of vernacular Chinese. For a time, everyone followed suit. Lin Shu, who loved writing in classical Chinese, was greatly angered and even denounced him as a "human demon." Yuanpei was furious and revealed that Lin Shu's manuscripts were published in a certain newspaper through Zhang Houzai. Houzai was studying at Peking University at the time. Yuanpei used this as an excuse to expel him, only half a year away from graduation. The student freedom movement was also advocated by Yuanpei. Yuanpei once said: "If the government is not good, students can investigate. If officials are corrupt, students can advise and admonish them." The student route is the fastest way to promote public spirit. The surging student movements over the years cannot be separated from Yuanpei's guidance. He never expected that today's students would rise up and beat him. Last year, the government discussed the drafting of the Civil Code. Yuanpei, with the status of a party-state elder, attended the meeting and strongly advocated for the abolition of surnames, marriage, and family, saying that men and women can unite anytime and anywhere and should not be restricted by family. If marriage is abolished, then what is the point of distinguishing surnames? Li Yu rose up to refute him. Hu Hanmin also disagreed. Wu Jingheng, who called himself "Granny Liu," was indifferent to everything. I believe that the creation of the Civil Code is related to the vital interests of the country and the people. I published a long article in the Tianjin *Dagong Bao* to correct its errors. Alas, Yuanpei has tasted much hardship and experienced many changes in the world. It is indeed incomprehensible that he still likes to express high opinions in his old age.</p>

<h3>Sharing the Enemy (22)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Bloodshed on the Battlefield</p>
<p>He himself comforted the people in the mountains, teaching them not to panic. At the same time, he strictly disciplined his troops, forbidding them from disturbing the civilian residences, and carefully guarded against attacks by the Sun Army. He also sent five representatives to H Province to explain the changes in T City to the authorities, expressing his willingness to cooperate and assist H Province to jointly resist the enemy. Zhongshu also said that the potential strength of bandits everywhere is very large. Although there are some unscrupulous people among them willing to be running dogs of the Sun Army, there are also loyal and righteous people who know that when national disaster is imminent, the government and the people should unite to resist it. It is better to send people to contact them, which can also serve as assistance. If our country formally goes to war with the Sun Army one day and recovers the lost land, we can directly attack their rear to support the main force. Hua Naiqiang deeply appreciated her words and immediately sent people out. He and Zhongshu trained the troops day and night, not daring to slack off. They hoped every day that their country would send troops to fight a decisive battle with the Sun Army. However, they craned their necks and strained their eyes, but their country remained silent and unresisting, without any corresponding preparations for national defense. They only harbored a fluke mentality, hoping that other countries would come to help them and uphold justice. However, in this world of power politics, the word "justice" can only be found in dictionaries. It simply does not exist. It is like an old vegetarian woman who encounters a disaster and prays to Guanyin Bodhisattva for protection. It is just a dream. The evil news of the Sun Army invading and plundering various places, however, was heard every day, making the two of them almost burst with anger. They drew their swords and slashed the ground, hating it intensely. One night, Hua Naiqiang was sleeping soundly when he was suddenly startled by a sound. Opening his eyes, he saw his subordinates reporting that the Sun Army had launched a night attack and was engaged in fierce fighting with his troops at the mountain pass. They requested that the commander go quickly to direct the battle. Hua Naiqiang hurriedly put on his clothes and got out of bed. He could already hear faint cannon fire. He grabbed his pistol and sword and rushed out of the camp. His attendants had already led over his horse. Hua Naiqiang leaped onto the saddle and galloped forward. Before long, he arrived at the mountain pass. He only heard the sound of enemy machine guns, as dense as a string of pearls. One after another, large cannons bombarded this side. Seeing that his own troops were barely holding on, Hua Naiqiang raised his sword and shouted, "Do not retreat! Those who retreat will be executed!" He quickly dispatched a battalion of infantry to reinforce the position. He took the lead in directing the battle, determined to defend the mountain pass. Suddenly, a bursting artillery shell flew over and landed beside him, exploding. He thought he was dead. Suddenly, he woke up in shock. It turned out to be a dream. He still did not believe it. He cocked his ear and listened quietly for a while. Indeed, there was no sound of gunfire. Only then did he feel relieved and went back to sleep. The next day, he rose and told Zhongshu about his dream. Zhongshu said, "Brother Naiqiang, your mind is always focused on the enemy, so you had this dream." Hua Naiqiang said, "Whether it is a dream or not, sharing the enemy with you, killing the enemy for the country, even if it means dying for righteousness, wrapped in horsehide, is my long-held ambition. In the past, Tian Heng of Qi had five hundred followers who refused to submit to the Han and vowed to die for their country. I secretly admire their aspirations. Moreover, I have a brigade of troops, which can still fight one battle. Zhongshu, Zhongshu, I only hate that my country cannot work together to resist foreign insults, or that it makes an alliance under duress, causing the enemy's power to become even greater, leading to the daily weakening of our country's power and the pain of the sinking of the Divine Land. Otherwise, I would willingly throw away this head for the country, and although I would die, I would still be honored." Zhongshu smiled slightly at Naiqiang. (The End)</p>
<h3>World News in Brief</h3>
<p>The First Gramophone. In modern families around the world, almost every household has a gramophone as a source of entertainment. Who invented this gramophone? It was none other than the great American inventor Thomas Edison. At that time, Edison was still a young man, experimenting with telephones. One day, he sang loudly into a machine he was holding. Suddenly, he jumped up in surprise. It turned out that his finger was suddenly stung by a small sharp point on the machine's casing. In that instant, he realized that the stinging of his finger was due to the sound waves vibrating on the telephone's vibrating plate. He then said to himself, "If it can sting my finger, then I can make a sound recording on something harder." He initially used cardboard to experiment, placing the telephone on the paper. At the same time, he made various sounds. Then, he moved the cardboard and listened carefully. He faintly heard that those various sounds had been recorded on the paper. Soon, he created the first gramophone. The record was a wax cylinder, and the earpiece was like a stethoscope used by doctors. The sounds on the wax cylinder said, "Good morning. What do you think of this gramophone?" Following that was a little tune, "Mary Had a Little Lamb," sung by Edison himself.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Standard Takes a Slight Dip</h3>
<p>▲ Market Fluctuates Unpredictably Yesterday, the price of gold fluctuated unpredictably, with rises and falls occurring at different times and with varying magnitudes. Fluctuations exceeded ten taels or more. The total daily range was eighteen taels. Overall, the price decreased by slightly more than three taels. Different brokers sought different supplies. However, due to the Western holiday market closures over the next two days, there were no wholesale transactions. The initial opening price rose due to reports of a fall in the big bars, but sellers became excited, possibly due to the excessive loosening of exchange rates, which then turned the market downward, almost falling to the seventy-tael border. Afterwards, exchange rates for British and American currencies seemed to trend towards profitability. Foreign firms slightly settled accounts, and confidence returned. The market conditions gradually rose, frequently increasing by more than ten taels. Later, the market suddenly turned weak, possibly because exchange rates felt quite loose, and also because sellers were constant. Many zero-lot buyers were eager to sell off their holdings, and the price had already plummeted by more than ten taels, almost experiencing a complete collapse. As for the transferring of February contracts to January, Dafeng Heng, a large bull, transferred them to the short seller Shen Kang, with a premium of only eleven taels, which was considered quite cheap.</p>
<p>▲ Front Market Rises and Falls Repeatedly From the early opening, the price increased by two taels, reaching six hundred eighty taels and five qian. The big bars also fell by eight and three-eighths. However, the silver price remained the same as before. Fuyu, Wanxing, and Shunli made slight gains. The price continued to rise by two taels, reaching eighty-two and a half taels. However, rumors that the German debt problem might be resolved, and that the United States intended to increase silver coin usage, caused market sentiment to fluctuate. Sellers were responsive. Jiyuan, Maoyong, Cuichang, Yongri Changyuan, Cheng Yonggan, Changxiang Yifeng, and others had already sold off. Moreover, American dollars were initially absorbed by banks at 3.625, then could be settled at .75, and then were bought by Zhongfu and Huabi at .75, causing the gold price to fall by ten taels. There were occasional one or two-tael rebounds. At 9:20 a.m., the price suddenly reached seventy-one taels. Soon after, Yifeng and Hengyu came in to buy, raising the price to seventy-four taels and eight qian. Banks mutually made term American dollars at .875.

Because foreign merchants were settling accounts, and HSBC absorbed American dollars for March at .75, and Holland and Huabi conducted counterpart transactions for February at .6875, the price jumped by six taels. At 10:00 a.m., it was seventy-nine and a half taels. The price then fell back by two taels. After 10:30 a.m., Chunyuan, Yonggan, Changxiang, and others bought in, and American dollars for March were mutually made by banks at .625, so the price rose again by six or seven taels. At 10:45 a.m., it was eighty-four taels. However, Yongfeng sold off. Also, China Bank released American dollars at .5625, immediately dropping to eighty taels and six qian. At 11:00 a.m., it seemed to show a promising trend.

Mitsui bought American dollars at .375. Within the market, Qian, Changxiang, Longsheng, Shenkang, Zhifeng, Yongyu, and others were all competing to buy, and the market was particularly firm, soaring upwards. By 11:50 a.m., it reached eighty-nine taels. Unexpectedly, HSBC had the intention to sell British gold, and Fuchang, Hongkang, and Yong were also eager to sell. Therefore, the noon closing was eighty-seven taels and four qian. It then dropped again to around eighty-five taels. Hu changed to seven hundred twenty-five taels, a discount of fifty to forty taels.</p>
<p>▲ Afternoon Retreats into Tiredness The afternoon market opened at eighty-four and a half taels. Following that, because Hengyu and the Dalian Gang bought in, the price immediately increased to five taels and eight qian. Suddenly, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Hengchang, Yongcuichangyong, Yongfeng, and others tended to sell off. Moreover, the exchange market gradually loosened. American dollars increased from .625 to .75. Various banks had the intention to sell, causing the market price to immediately advance to eighty taels. After that, HSBC released American dollars for January at .75 to .8125, with recent terms settling at .875. The price then plummeted by ten taels, until it reached seventy-one taels again at 3:30 p.m. Before long, it jumped up by four or five taels, and Zhifeng and Yong bought in, especially because HSBC absorbed British gold at eleven pence and .5625. Huabi absorbed American dollars for March at three yuan and .75. In addition, ordinary short sellers came to cover their positions, fearing danger due to the market closing. At 4:10 p.m., it was seventy-six taels and five qian, then reduced by another two taels, to seventy-four taels and two qian. When the market closed at 4:30 p.m., it was seventy-five taels.

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Soar, Trading Halted</h3>
<p>▲ Market Discovers Squeeze, Sudden Rise of Three to Four Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 24th), the situation on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange for various bonds was as follows: There was still much buying and selling of spot goods in the morning, but in the afternoon, only salt tax bonds were being traded. The futures market was approaching delivery, and prices were rising sharply. Market sentiment was lively, and buying and selling was particularly strong. Regarding the trend of bond market prices, there was a sudden and surprising change. Although the situation in the Northeast was becoming increasingly tense, and there were already battles on the front lines of Jinzhou, the bond market environment had undergone a turnaround. There was unexpected development in the market, with prices not falling but soaring. According to market sources, a portion of the principal and interest of the extended bonds may not be paid, but the government, in order to enrich its finances, is planning to find other sources of revenue, and practical measures have been devised. It is also rumored that there will be changes in the financial authorities, but it is still unclear whether these changes will be beneficial to the bond market.

It was heard that the manufacturers' warehouse receipts had already been withdrawn by the large factories, and only the small factories were likely to deliver. It was heard that 20,000 to 30,000 bags had already been delivered. The distant months were also very flat at first, but in the afternoon, around the fifth session, there was some interest from the inland, and floating positions were also compensated for, so the atmosphere became slightly lively. As a result, the current month was better than the previous day by 2.5 li, the January-February period was unchanged, and the March-April-May period was better by 7.5 li each.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Market Covers Short Positions in Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was exceptionally calm after opening in the morning, and trading was also lackluster. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially stable, but then, due to urgent short covering by outside speculators, coupled with rumors that the arrival of foreign wheat in the next one or two months might be reduced, sentiment suddenly became bullish, and prices rose by about 4 to 5 fen compared to the previous day. However, the sale of foreign wheat was still not seen. Australian white wheat was said to be offered at 3 taels and 6 and a half qian. If this is true, the future will be difficult to improve. As a result, January improved by 5 fen, February improved by 6 fen, March improved by 5 fen, April improved by 4 fen, and May improved by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Trends Weaken Further</h3>
<p>▲ Taikoo Sugar Supply Shortages See Stability</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegrams reported that the price of Cuban spot sugar was still 1.09375, the price of New York futures sugar for December was 1.01, a further decline of one cent from the previous telegram, the price for March next year remained at 1.06, May was 1.12, up one cent, and September was 1.23, also unchanged. The price of Javanese spot and futures sugar remained unchanged. The market atmosphere was weak, and with Christmas Eve the next day, buying interest was even more sluggish. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw and white was priced at 9 taels and 6 qian, but there were few inquiries. Finely ground white sugar was 9 taels 6 qian 7 and a half fen, and Dutch red No. 8 was 8 taels 3 qian and a half, but transactions were also very scattered and the trend was still firm. Taikoo sugar B mark was 11 taels 7 qian and a half, HX mark was 11 taels 5 qian and a half, DY mark was offered at 11 taels 7 qian, and HM mark was 11 taels 4 qian, and the market situation was generally firm and stable, mainly because the market inventory was perceived to be short.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Sluggish Before Christmas</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market became even more deserted. In previous years, European firms usually had transactions before Christmas, but this year, due to the sharp drop in silk prices in Europe and America, silk was not moving. Most of the raw silk held by local firms suffered losses, so everyone was dispirited and the market atmosphere was quiet. Yesterday, only 17 bales of yellow and coarse silk of three-star grade were received, and the price remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Coarse Silk and Silk Waste Shipped to England and India</h3>
<p>▲ Totaling More Than 400 Pieces</p>
<p>The British Company's Dutoitkei steamship exported yesterday. Shanghai's Samsung, Kechang, Meida, Xiangji, Xiangli, and other firms shipped a total of 300 pieces of yellow and white coarse silk to England for transshipment to India, and 135 pieces of yellow and white silk waste to Bombay and other ports.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea Sales to France Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, several British firms in Shanghai began to take action on Zhenmei green tea from Lujiang and Tujang due to demand from Morocco, with more than 500 boxes traded throughout the city. The transactions were not deserted, but because the future price was quite low, the market could not be stabilized. Wuyuan Zhenmei had already fallen by as much as 40 taels, and the rest had also fallen by 20 to 30 taels each.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Overcoats Plummet</h3>
<p>In recent days, the woolen fabric market has gradually softened. The best-selling overcoats have also gradually declined in the officially listed prices, and the declines in the unofficial prices are even greater. Yesterday, overcoats such as beaded cloth, cloud cloth, multicolored shimmering, plaid, and herringbone all fell without exception. With only a few days left in the year, the market inventory is still sufficient, and sales are gradually clearing. If the goods are stored until next year, they will not be sold until autumn, and the interest for half a year is not small. Therefore, sellers would rather sell at a discount, so the decline is particularly severe compared to other lighter wool fabrics.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Qingdao Group Buys English Steel Plates</h3>
<p>The trading of English steel plates has been quiet for a long time, so there have been no records in the market for a long time. However, yesterday, the Qingdao group made a large number of transactions in the 7.5 pattern, reportedly reaching 600 to 700 dan, which gave a boost to the sluggish market. The selling price was 5 taels and 2 and a half qian per dan, which was 1 qian higher than before. However, an investigation found that the market inventory was limited. If there is a large purchase, the future market is expected to continue to improve.</p>

<h3>In the Train</h3>
<p>— Zao Fang</p>
<p>The train started,</p>
<p>This is the last train from XX to XX,</p>
<p>It's rare for a third-class carriage to have only two passengers. Besides me, there's only one female passenger left. We're sitting opposite each other,</p>
<p>I looked up at her several times, wanting to see her more clearly, but I resented that the light in the carriage was too dim, and also, I was born with nearsightedness, so you can imagine how unfulfilled my wish was. And, I couldn't look at her too much because I felt a little embarrassed. As for her, I caught her staring at me four times. She was much more generous than me. She was probably a young woman under twenty, wearing a fashionable and soft autumn outfit,</p>
<p>The train moved forward. Because it was passing through the city streets, sometimes the light from the streets reflected through the train window was brighter than the light inside the train. After a while, it would naturally disappear again,</p>
<p>Where is she going, what is she doing, I thought to myself. A lone young woman, what urgent business couldn't wait until tomorrow? Ah, yes, she is a female student from the university in XX station. No, she doesn't look like a student. There's no question, she naturally has her own things. At least, I can guess that much. But why should I guess about her? And why would she need me to guess about her?</p>
<p>"Unconsciously," I muttered to myself,</p>
<p>It seemed that she had seen through my guess, it seemed that she was suspecting that I wasn't a good person - actually, I hadn't looked up at her, and I didn't know what expression was on her face - but I was stuck, at a loss, as uneasy as if I had committed a great crime. Hot sweat quietly broke out on my head and body. I felt a slight itch spreading inside my body, and I dared not move, fearing to arouse the other person's suspicion,</p>
<p>The air in the carriage became stuffy. My breathing became rapid.</p>
<p>Finally, the train arrived at XXX station. I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that there would definitely be passengers getting on the train, breaking the bad air in the carriage. That would be somewhat beneficial to me, otherwise my mind would be disturbed to who knows where. But it was rare, the station was deserted, except for a few faint lights and a few station staff, there were no passengers at all. Damn it, it must be because it was too late,</p>
<p>But there was still no despair. Just as the train was about to start, a passenger jumped on, a young man in a suit. Because he was catching the train, he had probably run a few steps, so he was panting urgently when he got on the train. He sat not far from me on the same bench,</p>
<p>He wasn't carrying anything. After sitting down, he tried his best to size up everything in the dimly lit carriage. Finally, his eyes fell on the woman, (during this time, he occasionally glanced at me a few times,)</p>
<p>The woman lowered her head,</p>
<p>I opened the train window, poked my head out of the train, and a gust of cold wind from the autumn night blew in my face. Before my eyes was a boundless, empty darkness,</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>Disturbance, fatigue, boredom... I closed the train window and lay down on the bench. After a while, I fell into a hazy sleep,</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>The train continued to move forward,</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>I was awakened by footsteps. A young man and woman were already sitting together. Strange, this thing is really weird, but I can't open my eyes. In fact, I'm not allowed to do this, so I quickly closed my eyes. I believe that my quick movements were not noticed by the other person. My heart was pounding, beating somewhat abnormally. There was movement. That's right, it was a low voice,</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Going to ○○?" the man's voice,</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"It's very late,"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"...Last name..."</p>
<p>"Jiang,"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Going back to school?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"It's almost ○○ station"</p>
<p>I then heard some light laughter. Sometimes, I could infer from the sound of footsteps that there was some movement. I don't know why, but I just didn't open my eyes. Was it because I was afraid? No...</p>
<p>○ ○</p>
<p>The train slowed down,</p>
<p>It stopped at ○○ station. Rickshaw pullers rushed into the car to solicit business. We arrived. I quickly stood up, ready to get off the train. I felt a little dizzy, my eyes blurred, and a shiver ran down my spine,</p>
<p>Those two passengers had already stood side by side at the train door. They got off the train. The woman was in front, the man was following behind.</p>
<p>"No, thank you," I said to the rickshaw pullers who were surrounding me and calling for business,</p>
<p>I got off the train,</p>
<p>"○○ Hotel," as I got off the train and walked out of the station, two rickshaws sped past me, the words were spoken by the man sitting in the rickshaw,</p>
<p>Suddenly, a jumbled impression flashed in my confused memory, "Was it them?"</p>
