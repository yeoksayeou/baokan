<p>船主張季丹一面發電求救、一面鑒於擱在礁石、船體十分危險、深慮海水漫灌各艙、則船身有下沉之虞、遂即打倒車退出、冐險開入附近之海灘上、使船體擱在沙灘、則可無沉没之禍矣、昨得電訊、該輪已在海岸淺沙中較爲安全矣、</p>
<p>▲派輪助救該行得報、昨已發電至營口令現在航行中之滬營班輪和興號、與營口烟台班輪榮興兩船、迅赴青山頭石島灣救護肇興、昨日滬行續得電訊榮興輪已先趕到石島、决將肇興輪内貨物駁卸後、代載來滬、使肇興改輕載脚、然後補修破洞、抽射積水再行拖救、而和興輪今日亦可以抵該處協助同救矣、</p>
<p>▲員客安全昨據該行總船主陳幹青君語記者謂、肇興輪頭艙貨、已受水漬、頗有損失、而船内之乘客、與船上之職工、均皆安全無恙、榮興已到、可望將貨客轉駁後送來上海也、肇興輪雖遭觸礁、危機已過當可拖救脫險、該輪俟漢口水勢稍退、仍須復行長江一路云、</p>

<p>調戲婦女大打出手</p>
<p>被拘工人聽候解訊</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時許法租界華成路愼餘里發生法商電　公司工人調戲婦女雙方引起劇鬥、下午五時許、工人又糾衆前往尋仇、並擁至嵩山路捕房門口、要求釋放被拘工人、結果巡捕無法制止、朝天開槍兩響、始行驅散、被捕工人七名、現尙押捕房候訊、茲將經過詳情、分錄於后、</p>
<p>▲阿娥年方十七甬人李根發、年二十四歲、向在本埠廣東路大來洋行進口部任職、人極忠實、家屬均在原籍、奈因隻身在滬謀生、乏人照料、乃挈同胞妹來申、賃居於法租界華成路四十五號弄愼餘里四號亭子間内、乃妹名阿娥、年方十七、略具姿色、然性極温和、協助乃兄、主持炊煑及洗滌一切雜事、</p>
<p>▲扶梯阻住歸路昨日上午十一時許、李之左鄰五號門牌高姓、家因接取電火、電氣公司乃命工人三名、前往工作、當時工人除携帶一切應用器具外、並肩帶長竹扶梯一只、置於五號後門狹弄内、正在工作之際、李妹阿娥適自外購買煤球燃料歸家、步抵弄口、而扶梯正阻住歸路、</p>
<p>▲工人肆意調笑當時阿娥見扶梯横置弄口不能通過、乃向工人磋商、詎工人非惟不允、且肆意調笑、並用泥污、擲于阿娥面上、阿娥乃向其理論、結果、被工人掌頰一下、阿娥乃係弱女、未敢抵抗、乃號淘大哭、鄰居聞聲畢集、見狀咸抱不平、遂亦不問情由、將工人一頓飽打、</p>
<p>▲李根發被毆傷其時工人因衆寡不敵工畢返廠、至下午五時許、被毆工人糾集工人五十餘人蜂擁至華成路、時適李根發公畢返家衆工人一聲呼嘯、復將李摔倒圍毆、李腰部擊成重傷、並被奪去雨衣一件、比時適有一西捕巡查經過深恐釀成事端、亟奔至小北門報警亭、用電話報告嵩山路捕房、</p>
<p>▲暗隨工人之後捕房聞訊、當即派出預備隊數十名分乘汽車、赶往彈壓、比抵該處已無工人踪跡、遂亦返歸捕房、惟當李被圍毆時、李有友人名莊子發者、適在旁目睹一工人將李之雨衣奪去、莊乃不動聲色、暗隨該工人之後、待機呼捕、</p>
<p>▲指出行兇工人莊尾抵八仙橋附近、親見該工人步上全安茶樓、莊亟奔報嵩山路捕房、捕頭派探會同往捕、比抵全安、適有工部局工人在該樓摇會、經莊指出在塲行兇工人一名、衆探正欲拘捕、工人竟羣起抵抗、結果、卒被逮捕李鶴生等三名、一併帶入捕房、</p>
<p>▲李根發又被毆衆工人見被拘去三人、當即糾集同類百餘人、齊赴嵩山路捕房門口、要求即時釋放、捕房爲消弭禍端起見、遂亦不加深究、隨時將三人釋出、不料事有凑巧、三人正在釋放之際、而被毆之李根發、正乘坐汽車、來投捕房報告、衆工人見李下車、復又上前毆擊</p>
<p>▲探捕各受㣲傷當時捕房亦調到探捕多人、上前彈壓、但工人來勢甚猛、無法制止、探捕乃向天發槍兩響、始被迫退散、在當時混亂之際、計有第六七五號三四○號、三七○號等巡捕及十號西探長巴爾第、六十一號西探並一俄探、均被擊受㣲傷、捕頭乃下令逮捕、共計捕獲七人、</p>
<p>▲被捕七人姓名被捕之七人中、四人爲電汽公司工人、三名爲工部局工友、電汽公司計有高木車間陳阿·四自來水間趙良、高木車間余金生·朱阿龍等四名·工部局爲馬逹間趙金生·瓦簡匠陳寳寳·及鐵匠間高阿富等三人、現均暫押捕房、候解第二特院訊究、捕房方面、更飭派大批探捕出巡、以資防範、電車公司、昨晚八時十分、所有車輛、即一齊進廠、</p>

<p>捐欵與收條不符</p>
<p>登廣告招接洽員</p>
<p>郭標之鄭重聲明</p>
<p>本月三日報載招請接洽員之廣告一則、大致謂今立刻欲請接洽員十位、須口齒伶俐服務忠心、准免保證、薪金每天兩元、願就者限今晚（三日）七時至十時、即臨大東旅社二樓一百二十三號接洽、隔日不候云云、但無署名者、而一般自問有此應徵資格之人、</p>
<p>羨其薪水之優厚手續之簡便、且無需保證、咸於是晚紛紛往南京路大東旅社一二三號室内報名、至則被寓於該室之男女拒絕接見、　言所需人員、茲已甄擇額滿、後至者惟有見棄、於是凡往報名之輩、莫不懊喪萬狀、麕集室外、　嘆緣慳、然去者仍絡繹而至、十時許</p>
<p>已聚有六七十人之多議論紛紜、有謂此種登報舉動實係欺騙行爲亦有謂室中人旣云額滿、則請其將所取之人姓名宣布、或介紹相見、否則未便貿然而返、正紛擾間、事爲該管老閘捕房華探長王英傑·西探長康英·所聞立即率領探員馳往、調查眞相、其時室中人見探員到來、當出室外指報名之羣衆爲係向渠拆梢者、而羣衆則稱該男女等串同欺騙、彼此各執一詞、探員乃着手調查、見室外懸有黄底黑字</p>
<p>漢災粤人乞振團之招牌一塊、並貼有緑底黑字之募捐啟事、旋入室搜查之下、抄獲捐簿一本、收條兩本、漢口水災募捐啟事一朿綢質徽章八枚、皆蓋有漢災粤人乞振團圖章及圖章一枚、烟具一副、惟核捐簿内所書捐欵之數、則有四百四十七元、而</p>
<p>收條僅四十一元相懸繤鉅、因向室中男女詰問姓氏及來滬任務、據云兩男性一名鄭有卿（即鄭伯壎）一名林山伯、兩女性一爲鄭王氏、年華三十、一爲唐靜華、芳齡兩旬皆隷粤東、此次因武漢水災奇重、災民慘狀亘古未有、各地旅漢人士目擊心傷、先後組織團體、四出募捐以資振濟、獨漢口粤僑尙無此種義舉彼等同屬國民未容坐視、故聨合同志十人、成立漢災粤人乞振團、特派彼等四人、於上月二十七日、自漢來滬、勸募捐欵、抵申後、即有鄭有卿</p>
<p>赴廣肇公所乞振當晤該所董事郭標·陳炳謙·二君、當荷慨捐六千元由公所派程炳奎偕鄭有卿携欵赴漢散放、嗣鄭以另有他事、未能抽身、乃由程獨往、此事曾見當時報紙紀載、至招請接洽員、則係另一事件、因欲創辦一</p>
<p>製造銅質火柴匣所招之接洽員、其任務爲兜銷該火柴匣、並非使其募捐、惟現以股本未集、廠址未定、故猶未開工製造、嗣探員詰以所募欵項、存僑何處、及捐簿與收條之數目不符理由、鄭亦竭力辯白、謂簿内捐欵、係屬自己塡寫、含有鼓吹之意、實在數目、應以收條爲憑、而所捐得之四十一元、其始謂已作旅費繼又稱存於吳淞路一百十二號聚昌押店、探員以若輩言語、頗多矛盾、行爲尤屬可疑、遂先將鄭有卿一名帶伺前往郭標處、詢問廣肇公所曾否有欵捐輸、經郭聲明鄭有卿實無募捐資格、且目滬埠</p>
<p>有粤僑正式團體凡公益事務、自有廣肇公所等辦理、不須彼越爼代謀也、探員繼乃帶鄭往吳淞路聚昌押店查詢、則據店主鄭阿元云、有卿雖係其子、但因不務正業、三載前已與姘婦離滬赴漢、從此不通聞問厥後雖曾返申然過家門而入、呼之亦不應、實際</p>
<p>父子之關係早斷路人不若、焉有欵存儲店中耶、探員至是乃恍然鄭等行爲、確有詐騙之意、因復帶回旅館、俾與其餘一男兩女拘入捕房、詎鄭猶不自悔、仍稱彼無不法舉動、探員不應干、涉但卒由探將該男女四人連同搜獲各物、一併逮捕、而前往報名者、亦紛紛散去、昨晨解送第一特區地方法院、由程尙豐推事開庭研訉、捕房律師錢恂九、以刑法三六三條之</p>
<p>詐財罪提起控訴而是夕前往報名者、則有朱效良·田九成·魯佩林·等三人到案作證、其餘諸人有住址較遠者、有以未曾喪失金錢、不欲對簿公庭者、故皆未列、首由錢律師陳述本案發生經過、以就搜出綢徽章八枚一點而論已足證明被告招請之人實係作爲四出騙取捐欵之使用、所稱備爲將來推銷貨物之語、殊不足信、惟本案尙須調查、請爲延期、繼由中西探長報告破案詳情後、證人朱效良、現任老北門晏海路</p>
<p>成才小學校校長彼因堂弟賦　、見該廣告、故代往報名、朱頗善詞令、當庭詳陳被告等假名欺騙之内容、揭發無遺、嗣程推事次第向四被告訉問、據鄭有卿供、住漢口二碼頭長興里、被乏振團派遣來申募捐、餘詞與其前言相似、林山伯供在漢口德興五金號爲跑街、此次被鄭相邀於八月二十七日偕同來滬募捐、鄭王氏供、亦係被鄭邀來、唐靜華雖隷粤籍、然所操則爲平津口音</p>

<p>蘇芬女士訉</p>
<p>芬被環境壓迫失學了、失學已多年了、傷心得狠、現在想到社會上去尋一些職業來、稍微減少我精神上的痛苦、不過自知識淺、到那裏去尋事、做那一件事是我相宜的、又加人地生疎、因此不敢前進、昨天讀了申報讀者通信欄、無限快慰、熱心的先生們呀、像這樣一個武没有氣力、文只能寫寫的我什麽地方是需要這種程度、什麽事情、是配我做的呢、深乞指敎、</p>
<p>（覆）承問求事的方針、可惜没有說明從前曾經學過什麽、到了什麽程度、就失學的又没有明白你現在的環境、怕復你的話不很中肯、</p>
<p>求事最好先有相當的準備、看你來信寫作的程度、或者於文件抄寫、書信起草、都還有勉力地擔任的可能、不過能力越是普通、求事越是困難、如有機會、得於文字方面、更求精進、自然較易逹到目的、正式的求學、固然不容易、或者想一種不妨家庭職務的補習、或自習、鄰近有無補學校、有無可以指導自習的敎師有無可以帮助你指導你解决這個問題的同學、或其他朋友、都還希望你自己多多想法、我們没有知道你詳細、無具體答復、這要你原諒的、</p>
<p>不過有一句話實獻你、有志者事竟成况在青年、前途機會正、多希望正多、旣𤍠心爲社會服務、就環境的可能、曲曲折折以求到你想到的境界、不是頂難的事、最需要的、是有條有理的見解、和平奮鬥的勇氣、最不可有的、是悲觀和蠻幹、</p>

<h3 id="c154">補習敎育的效用在那裏 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>江問漁（三）</p>
<p>我們要想敎這一班現在職業界可愛的青年　個個皆能增加他的職業上的生產能力固然應當給他以補習敎育的機會就是要敎他能忠實服務愛羣愛國志趣向上也不能不有恃於補習敎育還有一層我們眞正希望多數畢業小學畢業初中的青年能願意到職業界服務更應當有極完美極充實的補習敎育機關使他求學有地上進有階一面安心習業一面努力修學於是因修學而業乃益精因有業而學則更進我們且不必對於中國現行敎育制度敎育方法有所批評但是（不甚適宜亟須補救）這八個大字恐怕是大家皆承認的罷</p>
<p>第一他能敎公家不多費錢要設一所學校無論如何皆當建校舍購敎具可是一所巍巍高大而宏　的校舍燦爛而完備的敎具一到了下午四時學生下課便扃而不用豈不大大可惜今借固有學校以施補習敎育便可另外不要設備了如是工業學校用之以施工業補習則討巧尤大每日從下午五時起至九時半止有四小時三十分之久如是二小時一班一敎室内且可分設兩級學校敎員終日工作固然十分勞苦然有精力過人而又能熱心敎育的人未嘗不可以兼任此項兼任敎員之薪金當然比日課爲减如此便省錢許多了公家費錢少而敎育所及者衆這是多麽經濟呢（在大工廠内設有工人補習學校如是辦的有成績政府更當加以獎勵）第二能敎社會生產力增加民族生存力健全多數職業界青年能羣起受職業的訓練使其技益精其能益大一人生產技能增進生產數量增加集合起來便是全國全社會的生產技能增進生產數量增加如此則國貧民貧的困難問題不是可以解除了一大半麽不但此也前言補習敎育有三大主幹（即除職業訓練外還有體育及軍民訓練人格道德的修養）那更是民族生存發表的重要條件尤爲我積貧積弱的中國所必需倘使多數青年因受補習敎育能增加生產能力而又能結合團體𤍠心愛國努力奮勉國家基礎自然萬分鞏固了民族前途也自能得着無限光榮了</p>
<p>第三他能敎多數無力升學的青年得着深造的機會因此不以就業爲苦而以就業爲樂青年投身職業多以學業未能深造爲憾這也是人情之常並且可說是青年向上心的表現（但是其中有一部分受科舉敎育的流毒以畢業大學爲裝　當然要除外）今有補習敎育以供其需求　而執業暮而就學學分多級循序漸進不難由中學以逹大學十載幸勤一文不賞智識技能竟可與高中專科以上的畢業生相等（縱然不能十分完全但至少有一部分與高等敎育結果相同）如此則多數職業界青年皆可　欣鼓舞不再以就業爲苦了不但不以爲苦並且因就業以後可以安心求學免致父母担負學費受盡痛苦遂自覺個人前途光明燦爛或竟樂不可支如此一般青年乃至青年的父兄自能漸漸改變以往種種特殊的心理如重升學好虚榮的心理輕職業重知識的心理懐疑現在敎育厭惡現在學校的心理）到了此時才可使走頭無路的敎育得着一個絕大轉機</p>
<p>以上所說皆是有目共見的效能至於　補習敎育以推廣義務敎育以補助職業敎育在中國特殊社會情形之下可以表示特别的效力那就更不用說了</p>
<p>中華職業敎育社對於補習敎育的實施研究已歷多年所附設的有晨校有夜校有通問學墊雖是一時不能逹（三幹並立五級咸備）的程度可是完成補敎發展補敎的大願心社内同人却早經發過了最近本社辦事部内更新添補習敎育部以期集中精神統一事務試騐研究分途並進極願與敎育界及職業界各同志切實的互相聨絡共策進行俾中國未來的補習敎育可以作敎育界的一個重鎭可以爲救敎育病一劑良方我因爲是職敎社服務之一人對於補習敎育且具有特别的興趣故敢略述其感想以就正於海内諸同志（完）</p>

<h3 id="c170">世上三等人 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>世上有三等人。第一等人奉頭腦做司令；第二等人奉肚皮做司令；第三等人奉生殖器做司令。每人所奉的司令之天然部位便是他的人格的寒暑表。我們要做那一等人便站在那一個司令旗幟之下。我提出這條意見，並不是希望人人去做不食烟火的神仙和獨知主義的尙尼姑。偏重理智生活的康德也有兩次想找一個愛人。伯夷叔齊在武王伐紂之前也要吃東西。我不是主張請頭腦出來斷絕食色兩欲乃是主張請頭腦出來負指揮的責任。一般的人是有時聽頭腦指揮，有時聽肚皮指揮，有時聽生殖器指揮。當他受肚皮生殖器指揮的時候他是弄得頭昏腦黑，無法自拔。有的人，一天到晚，一年到頭，一世到老爲着爭食求愛，忘了一切，甘心做食迷情痴，至死不悟；這種人是最可憐了。青年的朋友們！現在頭腦，肚皮，生殖器都在開始招兵，立定你的宗旨，認請你的旗幟，選擇你的大帥去投効吧！</p>
<h3 id="c171">美國戲院門口之電目 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 李直青</p>
<p>美國芝加哥有聨藝戲院。最近裝置一件新發明品。可以自動登記入院觀衆之多少。據云。芝加哥各戲院利用此新發明品者。以聨藝戲院爲第一家。目下亦不過爲試騐性質。倘試騐後成績卓著。則全美各戲院。必步其後塵。競相裝置。可斷言也。</p>
<p>此項新發明品。人皆以（電目）稱之。其構造原理。係用一種光綫。普照戲院入口處。但此光綫初非肉眼所能見。每一人行經其地。光綫上即呈一波折。從此波折數目上。以推知觀衆之多少。故凡欲裝此新發明之戲院。其入口處必須特設門戶。使觀衆列成單行。魚貫而入。庶光綫波折。不致紊亂。在光綫每經一波折時。院内經理室中之記數表。即自動記數。此記數表之形狀。有若外國出租汽車上之記數表然。其記數從一至九九九九。完全照算術遞加方式。</p>
<p>職是之故。戲院經理。有此新發明品。在任何時間。祇須一望記數表。即知截至某時間止。已到觀衆若干人。如有人在一地同時經營戲院若干家。祇須將本人總辦事處。與所屬各戲院。用電綫接通。另裝分表。則各戲院每分鐘之營業狀况。皆可一目瞭然。更推而廣之。如有人在各地同時經營戲院若干家。亦祇須與總辦事處接通電綫。另裝分表。在任何時間。即可知各地戲院之營業狀况。更利孰甚。</p>
<p>不寗惟是此項電目。除能立刻報告營業狀况外。又能使售票員及收票員不敢舞弊。蓋從今而後。戲院中每塲收入之票價及免票數。必須與記數表上報告之人數相脗合。否則戲院當局。惟售票員及收票員是問也。</p>
<h3 id="c172">一淂之言 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>朋友之相交。各有其相慕相需之條件至一方之條件消失時。交情即中止。古今論交誼者。首推管鮑。須知鮑叔之義固高。而鮑叔之識尤不可及。因其非遇管仲不分金。受金者若非管仲。則不成鮑督也。今之好交遊者。惟責人之不爲鮑叔。而不責已之不爲管仲。抑何不思之甚耶。</p>
<p>▲愛情之純潔者。不容有條件。如食物然。嗜痂之癖。終身守之菖蒲羊棗之嗜。人未易詰其所以然。乃可以歷久不變也。否則珍饈猶厭。况藜薰乎。且一有條件。便有比較。有變遷。此自由戀愛者之結果。所以多離婚也。然古來之才子佳人。何嘗非自由。其相愛何嘗無條件。殊不知彼實成於憐才一念。才爲不變不磨之物。非若金錢勢位之有得失變遷也。故紅拂文君之事。遂成千古佳話已（夢蝶）</p>

<p>臨桂況君又韓爲先師蕙風先生長公子。淵源家學早飲香名。幼擅績事。嘗從姜頴生筠。何磐叟維樸。吳缶盧俊卿。諸老請益。都老咸器重之。研習旣勤。所詣與年俱進。君生長四川萬縣。桂林山水甲天下。則君之故鄕也。靈秀所鍾。得天獨厚。益以多見古人眞迹。臨奉殆遍。天賦學力。兩臻其美。故下筆便不同時史也。君作畫多創稿。往往賓筵雜還之閒。伸紙含毫。頃刻而成。蒼潤秀勁。神與古會。非澤古功深。曷足語此。比以溽暑課暇。日以作畫爲消遣。逸興遄飛。精品極多。朱丈彊邨。程丈十髮。及海上諸名公見之。莫不傾賞。多加以詩詞題識。佳畫名筆。相得益彰。昨訪君小蕙風移。見君方從事於調鉛殺粉之役。因得縱觀所作。山水而外。復有花卉佛像。摹古自運。各極其妙。巨幅小幀。琳瑯滿壁。觀止之歎。非阿私也。就中尤以二畫爲至精之品。君嘗得舊楮。截爲一小卷。高僅盈寸。長及丈餘。一爲三寸方小册。均作山水。千嚴萬壑。烟水蒼茫。具尺幅千里之勢。彊丈各爲題字。知藻鑒爲不謬也。君作畫消夏。本以自娱。友好見之。咸縱臾陳列。以公問好。君重違衆意。兼將就正大雅。特於寗波同鄕會開展覽會三日。今日開幕。佳儷錢夫人。工行狎書。哲弟小宋。精摹印作篆。並皆佳妙。一門風雅。趾美前修。知吾師之遺澤長矣。</p>

<p>兒童音樂作曲家胡警熙氏。因感於水災殺人。必需宣傳。方得籌欵辦賑。特作（乞賑謡）三首。其詞如下。（一）風啾啾。雨稠稠。江河水。漲不休。壩坍了。没法修。堤岸斷了水横流。無邊無岸一片水。呼天呼地萬家愁。風啾啾。雨稠稠。恨非尺鯉不能游。（二）恨悠悠。涙稠稠。淹田疇。没高樓。人與物。逐浪浮。千萬災民似楚囚。成孤成寡飄何處。無衣食住眼前憂恨悠悠。涙稠稠。冬來寒冷更無裘。（三）哀哀哭。苦苦求。賑災欵。踴躍投。送衣褲。發糧餱。救命功勝造佛樓。不救危難心何忍。自臨危難向誰求。哀哀哭。苦苦求。同胞快把賑欵籌。按此歌已遍傳各學校作爲敎材兒童之節餅助賑。得此亦有相當之影響願各學校廣爲傳佈云。</p>
<p>上海潤裕社說書團體。傳聞本月五號。將有義務會書之舉。售得之書錢。悉充水災賑欵而蘇州光裕社旅滬社員亦同有此舉前日上午十一時假西藏路東方書塲開會。并商得該塲經理陳靷春若同意。决定於九十兩號。舉行特别會書。晚上添加素人演劇。以資號召門票統售半元。東方不提開支。後臺一切雜耗。原定各社員分認担負。後經公决。則改由該社公積金内撥用。又原定實事求是辦法。不另售劵。俟該兩天日夜四塲總共售得若干票價即行交解收欵機關照收散賑。以清手續。茲因一部份人。恐號召力微弱。故仍主張印劵挨銷。雖担任推銷之人。頗形踴躍。劵價每張一元。當時聲明。九號領劵。十號晚間。一律交賑。以便結束。倘能洗盡歷來挨銷義務劵價習慣。速清結束。固屬籌欵史上開新紀錄。竊恐難逃歷來積習。不過據當塲担任推銷諸人報告情形固皆有十分把握。諒不致復蹈舊轍也。</p>

<p>— 銖菴</p>
<p>馬櫻花</p>
<p>客有不喜北平者。曰北平春夏間之塵土漲天。塞口鼻欲噎。齒嚼之有聲。此何可耐也。應之曰。誠然。北平市政之待商榷者。何止一端。此其一耳。他日市當局能闢較遠之規模。平治道路。廣植樹木。則此患　　剗除也。試觀東交民巷中之潔無纖塵。其故可想矣。夫平治道路。需費良多。或非旦夕所可期。至於植樹。安見其不能舉邪。古時宫禁多栽槐柳。唐人詩句。摹繪屢矣。北平故宫。猶存舊規。今中華門至天安門。丹垣之旁。尙多古槐。蟉枝攫拏。蒼鱗班駮。雖零落不成行。猶堪作美蔭。外此王侯第宅。門首亦多槐榆。壝壇廟宇。則饒松柏。而御溝側畔。垂柳　　。滃然濃緑。每延數里。皆足見往時樹木之盛。民國三四年間。興舉市政。東西長安街畔。垂柳廣植德國槐與馬櫻花。此二木皆易長。至今長夏垂陰。與黄瓦丹垣。映帶成至美之色彩。足徵其時猶有工於都市建設之人才。比年以來。則每歲清明。空購無數樹秧。植之街畦。旣無負專責者灌溉而監護之。不旬日輒復萎死。年年植稚樹。年年終於無樹。覆轍相尋。從無澈底更張之計畫。甚矣北平市當局之無人也。凡近年新闢之路。及繁盛之市街。多無樹木。每至夏季。烈日直射。行人爲之焦頭沃足。偶見一二高纔及肩之稚樹。摇摇欲斃。狀至不堪。其實每年植樹之際。但派專任警察十人。便可歷全城。監護其事。更可責成鄰近居戶。每戶專護一株。如或萎枯。立令賠補。事輕易舉。莫此爲甚。爲長者折枝。可爲而不爲。是北平市當局之謂矣。北平土宜之樹至多若樗若柳。幾於隨地可生。不加斧斤。從無夭折。他若桑棗槐榆之屬。可以薦盤盎充薪槱者。市民皆等閒視之。良可廣爲播種。顧余以爲最足以代表北平之樹。莫如馬頸之繁纓。故得是名。其色上紅下其葉瑣細對生。晝間舒展。不假培植。無待十年。高齊樓櫓。濃陰密布。能隔紅塵。循名責實。俱符嘉樹之號。使有賢明之市當局。盡一月力。遍樹此木於全城。則美蔭長垂。後之人永誦召棠之什矣。前年市政府定以菊化爲市花。夫菊非北平所獨有。又爲日本帝室徽識。嫌於淆混。盍若采馬纓花製爲圖案。不允雅切合邪。</p>

<h3 id="c176">丈夫的妻子（五） <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>李扶人想用極温和而含有犧牲精神的方法去感動李先生，伊索性站在里門口去守候丈夫，在每一個晚上；但是他仍漠然，不說什麽。有一天的半夜，西北風尖得和利刃一般的剌着人的肌膚，李夫人只穿着一件不十分暧的駝絨袍子，依舊站在里門前，守候丈夫。天忽然下雪了，起初只是些雪珠，後來越下越大，伊全身飛滿了雪，變成了一個雪人，伊的齒牙，冷得在顫戰，把自己的身子，靠在墻邊，兩臂交錯地自己抱住了身子，伊忘却了睡眠，忘却了寒冷與痛苦，只期待着丈夫的回家。伊很知道丈夫的幾個朋友家裏的地址，儘可以前去探聽，但是伊不願他的朋友都知道他近來是這樣晏歸，使他名譽上受到任何些微的損害。</p>
<p>管弄閽捕的瞌睡，被閙鐘驚醒，匆匆地欠伸拿了鎖，預備把里門上鎖的時候，他發現了墻邊有一個人，很得意地想施行他的威權；他以爲即不是小竊，至少是一個乞丐，他是有權驅逐，或者駡幾句，踢一脚，或者把這人抓住送到巡捕房，他可以得到記功的幸運。</p>
<p>（去！躱在這裏幹麽？）閽捕操着粗暴而威嚴的山東調嚷了出來，同時準備想用和狗熊脚爪相仿的粗手去抓了。</p>
<p>（是我，我是八十八號裏的。）伊嚇得幾乎哭出來，鎭定了神，才說出這麽一句話。</p>
<p>（咦？這麽大的雪，幹麽？快回去吧！）閽捕很失望地換了比較柔和的口氣，因爲他已發覺站着的不是小竊或乞丐，乃是每節給三元節賞的李太太。</p>
<p>（不，我在等候我們先生呢。）</p>
<p>（風刮得這麽大，雪下得這麽深，李太太你瞧！你身上全白了，還是回到家裏候着！）</p>
<p>（不，我在等……候我……們先……生呢。）伊一半因爲冷的緣故。一半伊被閽捕說得傷心在哽咽了。伊在怨恨伊的丈夫，還及不上一個不相干的閽捕，居然也說一句體恤人的話呢。</p>

<p>（魚巴煞）這個名詞常常在那些僑生的口中溜出來並且有很多人說到（魚巴煞）去但我畢竟不知道這是個什麽東西後來才曉得（巴煞）是馬來語（市）的譯音那末若照中國語來說就是（魚市）不過這魚市不是像上海小菜塲一部分賣魚的地方而是個幽美的娛樂塲這種娛樂塲恐怕除了濱海的島國而外在大陸的國度裏會没有這種靜美的樂園吧</p>
<p>魚市是一幢修築得雄偉精美的西式洋房養魚池不是像西湖清漣寺内的魚泉也不像花港那緑陰垂柳環抱着的魚池那是四周周和屋頂上都是用厚厚的玻璃築成的内面用引水管把海水引到中間去參觀的人們若進了魚市的大門就好像進了海王宫一樣的神秘市中陳設着長凳圓椅椅背上有臥枕可以使參觀者仰臥觀魚那些高貴的游客靜靜地坐着細細地領略那人間海王宫的風味如凝神怡視幾乎忘却人間還有一片污濁的塵土存在了那眞是一個世界以外的世界呵</p>
<p>那些活潑的游魚本來可以在周壁和屋頂隨意游泳的爲了要使數百種魚分門别類的原故所以也用了一些厚厚的玻璃間隔成百個水魚池在每隔玻璃池中可以放三四種或五六不等的游魚也有海中奇形怪狀的游泳動物在數百種魚中都具有特殊的美點與别質有三頭六尾魚色若赤金長有四尺游泳敏捷有雙猪頭獨蛇尾魚色如弱翠泳行笨滯牛頭魚色灰兩角後彎四足下垂亦可作鰭游泳鳳頭魚美麗異常有翅作鰭身上的花紋炫目游泳時作飛翔形若不是關在玻璃池中恐怕要飛到梧桐極顚上去吧美人魚頭面與人無異五官具全不過没有眉髮這算是魚類中最奇怪的了有人說這魚是已在海中修行千百餘年不要多少時候就可以成神但牠在池中還是和其牠的魚類一樣的游行或修息並没有見牠顯過一次神威最可愛的是正方形的八眼魚那珍寳般的眼珠同時張閉同時瞬動據市中的引導員說夜晚電燈熄滅後可以看見八眼魚的眼珠内發出螢火般的光芒我想恐怕夜明珠就是這種魚的眼睛吧有三尺長的緑龍蝦有篩子大的金螃蟹在數百種魚中舉不勝舉記不勝記總而言之在那活潑天眞靜美的世界裏的東西不是一滴淺藍的墨水與一隻呆笨的筆尖所能描繪的那眞是一個人間的海王宫</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Chiang Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Telegram Urges Zhang, Li, Wu to Come to the Capital</p>
<p>Nanjing, morning of the 4th, Chiang arrived at Xiaguan at 6 AM on the Yong Sui warship. Due to high water levels preventing docking at the pier, he switched to a small launch to go ashore. He then took a car into the city. Those accompanying him were only Chief of Staff Wang Shihe, Adjutant Zhang Zhen, and guards. Secretary Gao Lingbai is expected to arrive tomorrow. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing, Chen Guofu's old illness has relapsed and he is currently recuperating in Shanghai. He is expected to come to the capital at the end of the month.

<p>Hankou, the floodwaters in Wuhan receded slightly on the 4th. Two-thirds of the pontoon bridge has been completed, making it quite convenient for pedestrians. The breach at Chenjiaji on the Ping-Han Railway has been blocked. Test trains will be run soon, and traffic on the Ping-Han line should be able to resume in the short term.

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Orders Embassies and Consulates to Organize</p>
<p>Nanjing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed its embassies and consulates abroad, ordering them to immediately cooperate with local overseas Chinese merchants to establish disaster relief branches. They may also accept donations from foreigners, with all donations to be published in local newspapers to ensure transparency. Donated funds should be remitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at any time, which will then forward them to the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee, which will issue official receipts. Once the matter is concluded, the National Government will, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, express its gratitude separately. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Britain and the United States Raise Relief Funds <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, foreign news, Britain, the United States, and France, due to their leading commercial interests in China, the Japanese Emperor donated 100,000 gold yuan to the China flood disaster.

<h3 id="e5">Opinions of Legislative Yuan Members on Disaster Relief Bonds <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Disapprove of Issuance in Installments</p>
<p>Liu Guanxun Submits Resignation</p>
<p>Nanjing, a member of the Legislative Yuan said that the talk of a collective resignation was a statement of indignation from several members, not a formal decision. The colleagues believe that given the vastness of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster, the government should transfer all other reserve funds for disaster relief. As for the issuance of 80 million in installments, it is not impossible to do, but there are concerns about prolonged delays. The first two batches would be used for disaster relief, but later batches might be diverted to other political or military expenses, as happened during the era of the Northern Government. The colleagues also know that the collateral is insufficient. Given the extent of the disaster, even suspending the payment of principal and interest on other bonds once and transferring the funds to disaster relief would not be considered excessive. The colleagues, with a major disaster at hand, do not wish to act emotionally and resort to a collective resignation, and are still urging the financial authorities to pay attention to the disaster situation. From this, it seems that the rumors of a collective resignation yesterday are unfounded. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Liu Guanxun, a member of the Legislative Yuan, has submitted his resignation to the Legislative Yuan and has already left the capital for Shanghai. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Zhang Fengjiu, a member of the Legislative Yuan, went to Peiping some time ago to negotiate the installation of a wireless radio station in Xinjiang. He has now completed his public duties and is scheduled to return to the capital on the 9th. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, whether or not the collective resignation of members of the Legislative Yuan will be drafted and submitted is still under consideration. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

Since various countries had already participated in the mourning ceremony for Tan, the funeral procession was only attended by personnel from the consulates in the capital. Fan Guangxian, a foreign affairs official, set up a rest room for foreign guests at the martyrs' cemetery office in Linggu Temple and appointed Lou Tongsun's French wife, a member of the Legislative Yuan, and Yu Nengmo's French wife, a member of the Treaty Committee, as receptionists.

<p>Indefinite Extension of Deadline for Chinese to Leave the Country</p>
<p>Nanjing, the issue of the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico is now being mediated by the US government and is expected to not come to pass. Because China and Mexico have both signed the International Arbitration Convention, the United States can act as an arbitrator under the Convention. The US government has made considerable representations to the Mexican government and notified our government the day before yesterday. The US side said that the matter should be easily resolved. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington, the State Department has informed the Chinese Embassy that the US government can find a way to resolve the dispute between China and Mexico regarding Mexico's expulsion of Chinese nationals. It is reported that Chinese nationals in Mexico have encountered mistreatment, leading many to flee Mexico to avoid accidents. Relations between China and Mexico have therefore almost reached the point of rupture. Mexico plans to implement a labor law requiring that Mexican employees make up eight-tenths of all employees in Mexican shops. This law was promulgated several years ago and is now being implemented. Chinese merchants have been forced to stop operating. There is a so-called anti-Chinese committee in Mexico that is very active and abuses its power. The Chinese Minister to Mexico has made serious representations to the Mexican President. Furthermore, it is reported that the Mexican government has ordered an indefinite extension of the deadline for Chinese to leave the country, so Chinese nationals in northern Mexico have now temporarily stopped leaving the country. The original deadline was September 5th. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Natural Disasters Are a Sign of Human Misconduct</p>
<p>At the Crossroads of Extinction, How Can We Inflict Further Harm?)</p>
<p>Peiping, Zhang Xueliang issued a circular telegram yesterday advocating peace. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To all newspapers: I believe that national affairs are important and rely on collective efforts to uphold them. The slightest hint of good or bad fortune is tied to the sentiment of the people. We must first weigh the advantages and disadvantages to save the nation from danger. Since the founding of the Republic of China, everything has been difficult. Wars have broken out one after another, and insults have become increasingly frequent. The status of the nation has deteriorated day by day. As of today, construction has just begun to show initial signs, while destruction has reached an extreme. The country is like a pile of eggs, and the people are in dire straits. The severity of the floods in the provinces along the Yangtze River this year is unprecedented in centuries. Fields and houses have been washed away, and the lives of the people have been lost beyond measure. This unprecedented catastrophe is not only lamented by all virtuous people within the country, but also by all those endowed with blood and qi, who cannot help but feel compassion. How can we, whether with disheveled hair or adorned with caps, ignore this? We must remember that natural disasters are a sign of human misconduct. Facts are verifiable, and history serves as a warning. Today, the nation's lifeline hangs by a thread. At this crossroads of extinction, how can we inflict further harm? However, according to recent newspaper reports, there are rumors that peace will be broken. A moment of anger will lead to a thousand years of ruin. I have long admired your governance skills and dedication to the country, and I believe that you will not lag behind others. I hope that you will deeply understand the situation, jointly plan for peace, dispel old grudges, close your hearts, and help those who are hungry and drowning. Think carefully about what should be done first and what should be done later. Then, we may be able to revive peace, support the declining fortunes, comfort the people in their hope for recovery, and establish lasting achievements for the nation. The Party and the nation will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. Having witnessed these difficult and dangerous times, I offer my urgent words. I humbly ask for your clear guidance. Zhang Xueliang, Jiang Mi. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing, a foreigner said that many people in the flood-stricken areas cannot cook food. If they are given grain and wheat, they cannot eat it raw. If they are given cash, they cannot buy steamed dry food in time. Distributing steamed buns is only effective for six hours each time. Even if they are distributed ten times, they will only last for three to five days. These are not proper methods. It seems that the best way is to transport the disaster victims to a safe place, set up several large-scale porridge factories, and manage them with armed military police. In the future, they will be made to work. Those who do not want to leave their original places can be excluded from relief, because those who do not want to leave must have something to hold on to and can still find food for themselves, so they will not starve to death immediately.

<p>(III) Based on the entirety of the world capitalist economy, it is obvious that the Chinese economy is under the rule of capitalist economy in the same time and space, and their mutual connection is self-evident. However, China has not yet undergone a vigorous industrial revolution to this day. Therefore, the development of the Chinese economy cannot be balanced with the economies of advanced countries that have entered modern financial capitalism from industrial capitalism. Because it cannot be balanced and appears backward, the economic power of industrially advanced countries is like mercury pouring out of the ground, entering without any gaps, rushing towards backward China. China is involuntarily pushed onto the capitalist road, and in the entire world economic system, the connection between the economy of backward countries and the economy of advanced countries, the economy of the suzerain state and the economy of the colony is established. The explanation of this connection is the role of (market expansion) and (raw material expansion) that occur under the outward-developing nature of the capitalist economy in China's vast land, large population, and abundant raw materials. Backward countries are the market for the products of advanced countries and the absorption field for surplus capital. Backward countries are the place for advanced countries to extract raw materials. The opening of five trading ports by the Treaty of Nanjing, followed by the opening of 102 trading ports and the temporary suspension of 29 ports, proves that the capitalist economy has established a base for import and export in China. Banking groups from advanced countries such as the United States, Britain, Japan, and France have opened 42 foreign banks in China, possessing huge amounts of capital: US$50,000,000, £11,000,000, 13,000,000 taels, 182,000,000 guilders, and 543,000,000 Japanese yen. Their head offices are mostly in London, Hong Kong, Paris, New York, Tokyo, and other places. In addition, the fact that entrepreneurs from advanced countries have built railways and factories in China is sufficient to prove that the capitalist economy has established a solid base in China. This fact best illustrates that China and the world not only have the effect of natural division of labor, industrial division of labor, and social division of labor in the exchange relationship of the international market, but also demonstrate the relationship of domination and subordination in the degree of economic development. Recently, the Pacific problem, which focuses on the China problem, is the focus of attention of the capitalist powers actively preparing for a new division of the world, which further illustrates the position of the Chinese economy in the world capitalist economy and its mutual connection.</p>
<p>(IV) The changes in the Chinese economy. Here, we have no time to trace back to the distant past, and can only discuss the changes in the Chinese economy caused by the impact of the world industrial revolution. The driving force of social evolution is new productive forces. New productive forces change the old production methods and overthrow the old economic organizations at the same time. The hand-pushed wheel produces feudal society, while the steam-pushed wheel produces capitalist society. For more than 2,000 years in the past, China has been stagnant in the category of small-scale agricultural production and small-scale handicraft production, and its economic structure has also been stagnant in the feudal economic stage for a long time, closing itself off and being self-sufficient. Since the industrial revolution occurred in Western Europe and new productive forces were obtained, China's long-term closed and self-sufficient economic barriers were broken by the economic power of industrially advanced countries. The opening of transportation facilities, the improvement of production tools, the construction of new-style cities, the development of raw materials, and the import of commodities, advanced countries forced China to embark on the same path as them according to their own models. China's old feudal economic organization was as fragile as rotten wood, and it was on the verge of collapse day by day. Today, capitalist countries have advanced from exporting commodities to exporting capital. Chinese society is changing from quantitative changes to qualitative changes, from the collapse of the old foundation to the budding of a new foundation, in accordance with the historical nature and regularity of evolution. Major cities have mostly been electrified and industrialized. The import of industrial machinery has increased sharply year by year. Most agricultural production is to supply the needs of the international market. The economic power of cities extends into remote and poor areas, dominating every farmer and farm woman. All of these are enough to prove that backward China, under the forced guidance of advanced countries, has begun to step into the future of capitalism. Recently, the League of Nations has also had a so-called (Ten-Year Plan) for our country, which is doing its best to exert its forced guidance. In this process of transformation and under the economic rule of advanced countries, China's old economic foundation is becoming more and more corrupt, and the lives of the majority of the people are becoming more and more deteriorated. At the same time, because the economic power is in the hands of advanced countries and cannot be independent, it has been reduced to a semi-colonial status and is at the mercy of international capital imperialism. It is impossible to establish national capitalism through free competition. Furthermore, with years of natural disasters and man-made disasters, the phenomenon presented in the economy is even more ruined, impoverished, chaotic, and withered.</p>

<p>Hankou, at the time of the Texaco oil depot's accident, an act of bravery was recently revealed. When the fire started that day, Mr. Li of the National Flood Relief Association happened to be on a small steamer near the oil depot waiting for the arrival of airmail. Mr. Li caught sight of a burning cargo ship with several sampans tied to it, carrying more than a hundred people. He quickly ordered the captain of the small steamer to cut the mooring ropes. At that time, oil was overflowing and flames were shooting out. It was very dangerous to do this. However, the captain eventually braved the danger and towed a sampan away from the cargo ship. Once one rope was cut, the remaining ropes were released and all the people in the sampan were able to save their lives. If this had not been done, or if there had been a slight hesitation, none of the people would have been spared. Mr. Li later rewarded the captain of the small steamer and his assistant with 100 yuan. The manager of Texaco also thanked Mr. Li and others. Mr. Li can truly be said to have acted bravely in the face of righteousness. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Situation of the New British Government <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Conservative Party with the Heaviest Color</p>
<p>MacDonald Isolated and Helpless</p>
<p>Political Situation Slightly Clearer</p>
<p>Labor Unrest Resurfaces Vigorously</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 4th The list of secondary personnel of the government has now been released. According to statistics, the number of government personnel, including cabinet members, is 50, of which Labour Party members account for only 8, Liberal Party members account for 11, and Conservative Party members account for as many as 31. Among the eight Labour Party members, Malcolm MacDonald is the Prime Minister's son. He is 30 years old and has now been appointed as Under-Secretary for the Colonies. Many important figures from the Conservative Party, such as Embury Hall and Metland, have not been given positions, and many people are surprised by this. It is said that the cabinet positions of this tripartite coalition government are limited, and it is difficult to recruit all the former Conservative Party government cabinet members. Those who have served as cabinet members cannot condescend to lower positions due to considerations of dignity. It can be seen that the new government has the heaviest Conservative Party color and Prime Minister MacDonald is isolated and helpless. The British delegation to Geneva is entirely composed of Conservative Party Senators because the number of Labour Party members who have joined the new government is extremely small and they must stay in London. The Labour Party is now planning to gather all its strength to deal with its former leader. Anyone who is with MacDonald will be excluded. Even Mac's private secretary is no exception. He was originally scheduled to be a Labour Party candidate for the next election, but now the Labour Party has cancelled his candidacy. MacDonald will first ask for a vote of confidence when Parliament resumes on September 8, and then announce the contents of the government's proposal. Reuters has learned that the cabinet unanimously advocates this, which also shows that the Prime Minister is eager to know how many people support him. There is no doubt that the opposition is strong and the struggle is fierce. Henderson is extremely strong and has long had the ambition to lead the Labour Party. He has managed the Labour Party's organization with an iron fist for many years and has a good organization. Therefore, he can consolidate the Labour Party's group today and unanimously oppose the Prime Minister. Former cabinet members such as Benn, Graham, and Miss Bondfield have also agreed to support Henderson. It is expected that there will be a severe scene in the lower house, and disgruntled former cabinet members may shout (traitor), because they believe that the work that has been painstakingly carried out for two years has now been sacrificed on the altar of capitalism and financial interests. Although, under Henderson's guidance, the Labour Party is now putting great pressure on Labour Party members, there are still some Labour Party members who plan to support the new government when Parliament convenes. Wright declared to the public that he did not want to be bound by himself and must wait to see the new government's proposal and examine whether it is beneficial to the national interest before he can decide his attitude. Furthermore, the Labour Party expected that the new government would not be able to meet with Parliament before September 15. Now the cabinet is working quickly and plans to complete it, which is unexpected by the Labour Party. The cabinet will no longer meet until Monday, which shows that their opinions can now be quite consistent.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd The British political situation is slightly clearer, and the undercurrent of labor disputes is now gradually swelling. The safety workers in the Scottish coal mine voted, and the majority supported the strike and opposed the reduction of five pence per day. The union has decided to issue a strike notice, which will be implemented in 14 days. At the same time, the Lancashire cotton industry employers and weavers' union negotiated and failed to agree on the labor price for the new system of increasing the number of looms managed by one weaver, resulting in the breakdown of negotiations. Employers are very willing to establish a new system so that they can restore the prosperity of Lancashire.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Heated Debate Between Russian and French Representatives at the European League Conference <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Both Sides Clashed Fiercely</p>
<p>Germany and Austria Simultaneously Announced the Abandonment of the Tax Alliance</p>
<p>▲Guomin Society, Geneva, 3rd Today's European League Conference began with a speech by Austrian Foreign Minister Skobel. Mr. Skobel's tone was peaceful, announcing the abandonment of the German-Austrian customs agreement plan, and as a result, a fierce debate broke out between Russia and France. Russian Foreign Commissioner Litvinov and French Finance Minister Frantin clashed fiercely, and the representatives of other countries were speechless and regarded it as a strange thing. The starting point of this Russian-French dispute was the Russian representative Litvinov's attack on the so-called priority system in Europe. The Russian representative pointed out that the priority system was specifically aimed at Soviet Russia, and this matter has become increasingly clear, which is enough to show that European countries have no intention of mediating so that the two major economic systems of assets and state-owned can have the hope of peaceful cooperation. Hearing this, French representative Frantin stood up and accused the Russian representative's remarks of being merely propaganda and without concrete and practical plans. Mr. Frantin also said that European countries did not deliberately treat Soviet Russia unfavorably, but Europe's every move was considered by Soviet Russia to be a possible aggression. Even giving Soviet Russia urgently needed loans cannot be regarded as an aggressive act. The Russian representative's reply was initially quite indignant, but later he focused on the sincerity of Soviet Russia's willingness to cooperate with various countries, so the situation tended to ease. As a result, a subcommittee was organized to draft an economic report and submit it to the League of Nations Council again.</p>
<p>▲Guomin Society, Geneva, 3rd At today's European League Conference, after Austrian Foreign Minister Skobel announced the abandonment of the German-Austrian customs plan, German Foreign Minister Kurtis stood up and spoke after him. His speech was very long and his attitude was neither humble nor arrogant, which was enough to show that this was a sacrifice for the sake of European coordination. However, the right of Germany and Austria to conclude a customs treaty was not restricted as a result. Mr. Kurtis's speech aroused a lot of sympathy from various countries, and there was warm applause both inside and outside the venue. When Mr. Kurtis finished his speech, (the following is a Reuters dispatch) French Finance Minister Frantin stood up and said that the declaration of Germany and Austria could promote good understanding and cooperation in Europe. Mr. Frantin's words can be regarded as France's expression of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The King Still Has Supreme Authority</p>
<p>Parliament Adopts a Bicameral System</p>
<p>Breaking the Idea of Race</p>
<p>▲Guomin Society, Belgrade, 3rd The dictatorship of Yugoslavia was established in 1929. Now that it has been abolished by King Alexander's edict, the public opinion has suddenly become excited, and they all wish Yugoslavia a prosperous future. The king issued many orders this time, and the new constitution passed by the cabinet was also issued together. According to the new constitution, Yugoslavia will have a bicameral parliament. The members of the lower house will be directly elected by the national universal suffrage law and will serve a term of four years. The final decision on the bill will be made in the upper house. The upper house can veto the bill passed by the lower house. Half of the members of the upper house will be elected by the people and will serve a term of six years, while the other half will be appointed by the king. Therefore, the king still has great authority over the legislative body. According to the constitution, the people have absolute freedom of speech and publication, but the Communist Party alone does not have this right. Communists have no right to stand for election or participate in election work. The inviolability of private property and judicial independence are also specifically stated in the new constitution. Furthermore, the provincial boundaries of Yugoslavia will be re-delimited, breaking all previous racial ideas and historical concepts. The languages and writings of Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia will enjoy equal status.</p>

<p>300,000 Workers from Various Industries Participated</p>
<p>The Whole City is Dark and Traffic is Suspended</p>
<p>The Police Killed Civilians Without Authorization, Which Caused</p>
<p>▲Guomin Society, Madrid, 3rd Last night, the prisoners in the Barcelona General Prison mutinied, and hooligans rioted. The security team was afraid that it would cause a major change, so it used high-pressure means to open fire and drive away the crowd, resulting in many deaths and injuries. Therefore, the group union announced a general strike in Barcelona because the security team killed civilians without authorization and handled the situation inappropriately. More than 300,000 people have responded to the strike this afternoon, and the situation is quite serious. Therefore, martial law has been declared in Barcelona. Among the workers who are currently on strike, the workers from the electric power plant and the gas plant have joined the strike, but the workers from the water plant are still working as usual. The services on trams and buses</p>

<p>People have also announced a break, and traffic in the entire area has become deserted. Business is also at a standstill. Most of the shops did not open today from the beginning, and the few shops that opened in the morning immediately closed again because martial law had been declared. As for the workers' demands, they must release all political prisoners in the prison, and the governor should be fully responsible for last night's bloodshed and should be dismissed immediately. These demands have been rejected by the authorities, and they have telegraphed the central government to ask for troops to be sent to suppress them as soon as possible. The security team and militia in the area are all on standby to prevent accidents. Machine guns have been installed at all important intersections, and tanks and armored vehicles have also been prepared. Rescue vehicles have been equipped with adventure lights. By the afternoon, the first disturbance occurred, and striking workers clashed with the police, resulting in the death of two workers. This situation has a tendency to expand, so the political circles are extremely worried.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Barcelona, 4th The wives of the striking workers have risen up to oppose their husbands' strikes. These people announced today that they would not prepare meals until their husbands returned to work, and used the slogan of children's eagerness for politics. The gas supply has been cut off, and there is a shortage of bread. There was another shooting this morning. Communists opened fire on the police, and the police returned fire, killing one Communist and injuring two others.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 4th Recently, unexpected incidents have occurred between China and Japan in China. Japanese public opinion is very excited. The military authorities are particularly angry with the Chinese government's attitude towards the murder of Captain Nakamura and his companions.

Today's evening newspapers all wrote in large letters that not only the military is dissatisfied with this, but also the members of the Seiyukai have recently shouted loudly, opposing the government's weak policy towards China. It is reported that several senior military officers have recently given speeches on the issue to junior officers of the active and reserve forces, warning them that the situation in Manchuria and Mongolia is becoming increasingly serious and that there may be important developments.

<p>Official Telegram</p>
<p>From Hankow to All Newspapers: I am mindful of the unfortunate events in life. Calamities come from both human actions and natural disasters. However, never before have we experienced such a succession of human and natural disasters. The suffering in Jiangxi this year has been particularly severe. Since the Communists entered Jiangxi in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], they have occupied the land, wielding tyrannical power throughout the province. The scale of devastation and the duration of their occupation have resulted in widespread loss of life and the destruction of homes, a situation unmatched by any other province and rarely seen in history. Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek personally led the suppression efforts, retaking important cities and driving out the insurgents. Although the land is desolate and resources depleted after the ravages of war, the twenty-odd counties that have not fallen into Communist hands still offer refuge for those seeking shelter and a glimmer of hope. However, misfortunes never come singly. Another catastrophe has struck: a great flood. The Gan River and its tributaries have overflowed, inundating fields of vegetables, wheat, and rice. Since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has persisted for over a month, causing flash floods and turning lakes into vast expanses of water. Rivers have burst their banks, and dikes have collapsed, leaving people homeless and without any means to build shelters. People and livestock are swept away, with no ground left to bury the dead. The flood affects twenty-odd counties. We, the survivors, are either dying in the aftermath of war or being drowned by the terrifying waves. There is no escape from death, no way to seek survival. Human disasters are followed by natural disasters, and natural disasters are exacerbated by human actions, creating a vicious cycle of calamity and extreme suffering. The central government's relief efforts and the borrowed funds are merely a drop in the bucket, insufficient to help everyone. Furthermore, our colleagues in the association are themselves affected by the flooding in Hankow and are preoccupied with their own survival, resulting in meager fundraising efforts. We pace around the room, our hearts full of concern but our resources depleted. We sincerely believe that you, pillars of the party and state and great philanthropists, can appreciate the gravity of the disaster in Jiangxi and its significant impact on the people's livelihood and the military situation. We implore the government to weigh the priorities, allocate substantial funds, and dispatch personnel to distribute aid on the ground, recognizing that saving Jiangxi is saving the nation. We also earnestly appeal to you, in the spirit of human solidarity and the benevolence of Heaven, to contribute generously or make a public appeal to gather support. Only through multiple fundraising efforts, both public and private, can the dying people of Jiangxi have a chance to recover and rebuild. We will forever be grateful for your kindness and will repay your benevolence with unwavering loyalty. This telegram is urgent. We await your instructions with utmost anticipation. Huang Wenzhi, Chairman of the Jiangxi Compatriots Association in Hankow, bows in winter.</p>
<p>From Hankow to All Newspapers: I am mindful that the flooding in Hubei Province is unprecedented in centuries. Current reports indicate that 45 counties are affected, with over ten million people displaced. Fields and homes have been turned into lakes, and there is no harvest to be reaped. The living are scattered and starving, while the dead lie unburied, floating with the waves. The tragic scene is unbearable to witness. The central government has specially dispatched Director Rui Heng of the Planning Department, along with advisor Baker and Committee Member Li Jinxian, to Hubei to investigate the disaster and organize epidemic prevention and relief efforts. After consultation with local officials, a Hubei branch of the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Victims was established to coordinate these efforts. At a meeting on August 20th, we were entrusted with managing this branch. The headquarters were established at the Municipal No. 1 Women's Middle School on Simin Street in Hankow, and operations began on August 27th. While investigating the needs of the flood victims, we are also organizing emergency relief efforts. Given the vastness of the affected area and the large number of victims, substantial funds are needed for shelter, food, and supplies. With autumn approaching and the weather turning cold, clothing is also a pressing need. To save humanity from this unprecedented catastrophe, the combined efforts of all righteous and benevolent individuals across the country are essential. Only through collective support can we overcome this crisis. You, gentlemen, deeply care for the suffering of others, and the entire nation looks to you with anticipation. We implore you to act on the belief that "one's own hunger is no different from the hunger of others" and to fulfill the aspiration to "save the world and save humanity." Please contribute generously, no matter how small. By reviving the dead and bringing hope back to life, you will earn the gratitude of the flood victims. We urgently send this telegram to present the situation and humbly request your consideration. Chairman and Committee Member Fang Benren, Executive Members Li Jin, He Baohua, Zhou Xingtang, Zhou Cangbai, Wu De, and Shi Zhao Huanzhang bow in winter.</p>
<p>From Tai'an to All Newspapers: We have just sent a telegram to Chairman Song Ziwen of the Disaster Relief Committee, which reads: "This year's flood has been devastating, affecting a vast area and threatening to submerge the land. Such a disaster has never been seen before. The Yangtze River basin, including Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangsu, and the Yellow River region, including Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Hebei, have seen fields turned into ruins and roads filled with refugees. The alarming reports are shocking. The National Government has decided to encourage officials to donate their salaries to aid relief efforts, and the entire nation is mobilizing to provide assistance. Even friendly countries have expressed their sympathy. As soldiers serving the people, we have witnessed the disaster firsthand and are deeply saddened. Therefore, all officers and soldiers of our army have voluntarily donated their August salaries to support relief efforts, totaling 20,000 yuan. Given the army's limited budget, we are hardly in a position to donate. However, compared to those who are without food or clothing and displaced from their homes, we are still relatively fortunate. Driven by our conscience, we dare to offer this humble contribution, hoping for your understanding." We also hope that the virtuous leaders of the party and state and benevolent individuals across the country will extend their generosity to the disaster victims and work together to save them. This telegram is urgent, and we await your instructions. Commander-in-Chief of the 15th Route Army Ma Hongkui, Chief of Staff Luo Zhen, Independent Brigade Commanders Ma Tengjiao and Ma Quanliang, Deputy Division Commander of the 35th Division Ma Longbing, Brigade Commanders Lu Zhongliang, Ma Baoju, and Ma Yingcai, Headquarters Directors Wang Tingru, Ma Rulong, Feng Yan, Jin Yanbin, Su Lianyuan, Zhao Wenfu, Ma Xixian, Yu Dingming, Hai Tao, Sun Shenpei, Ren Zhongjie, Regimental Commanders Ma Renshou, Ma Guoxiu, Che Youxi, Hao Jinyuan, Ma Zhaotu, Han Haili, Ma Zhonghai, Li De, Ma Yizhong, Ma Yaozu, Chen Youfu, Tian Shaoqiu, Ji Hanyuan, Fan Yingkui, Independent Battalion Commanders Qin Fushu, Jin Zhongren, Wang Zhenkun, Zhou Dingbang, Zhao Baocai, and all officers and soldiers bow in Jiang.</p>
<p>From Baoying to Shen Bao and Forward to All Newspapers: We have just sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, which reads: "To the Shanghai Jiangsu Relief Association: This summer's continuous rain has caused devastating floods. On the west bank of the Grand Canal, hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile land have been completely submerged. Houses have collapsed, and people and livestock have been washed away. Recently, the rice crop on the east bank has also been destroyed due to backwater flooding. In the Tongxing, Tongyi, and Tainian areas, the dikes of Yanshao have collapsed, causing backwater flooding and submerging farmland and homes. The people are facing unprecedented disaster, displaced and destitute. The entire county is in dire straits. We urgently request a substantial sum of money to organize emergency relief and alleviate the suffering. The Baoying County Party Headquarters bows in Jiang."</p>
<p>From Jilin to All Newspapers: National difficulties have not ended, and the people's lives are coming to an end. This year's floods in the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Gansu, as reported in the Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beiping newspapers, and the successive letters and telegrams received from various provinces and regions, have highlighted the lack of adequate assistance and caused us deep concern. We have urgently convened a joint meeting of the Provincial Committee members and the leaders of local organizations and decided to establish a special agency within the provincial government, named the "Flood Relief Committee for Various Provinces," which was officially established today. Provincial Chairman Zhang Fuchen was elected as the Chairman, and Chairman Zhang Songling of the Chamber of Commerce was appointed as the Committee Chairman. Other members were appointed to various positions. We believe that donating salaries during times of famine is a well-known practice, as stated in ancient texts. Although our contributions may be limited, our relief efforts are rooted in conscience. We will provide food and money as needed and do our best to offer assistance. We are sending this telegram to inform you of the establishment of the committee and seek your guidance. The Flood Relief Committee for Various Provinces Attached to the Jilin Provincial Government bows in Jiang.</p>

<h3 id="e63">State Funeral Held for the Late President Tan <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>After the death of the late President Tan Yankai, his body was temporarily placed in the First Park. Now that the construction of his tomb is largely complete, a state funeral was held on September 4th. The State Funeral Preparatory Office meticulously planned all the ceremonies according to the State Funeral Law. Many important figures from the central government and leaders from all sectors of the country, as well as foreign guests, either came to Nanjing in person or sent representatives to participate. On that day, all civil servants wore black armbands, and all entertainment was suspended. All government agencies, organizations, businesses, and residences flew flags at half-mast. The ceremony was solemn and respectful. The details of the funeral are described below:</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Funeral Hall: A new white mourning archway was erected at the First Park. Gifts such as newly received wreaths and framed inscriptions were displayed throughout the funeral hall. The State Funeral Preparatory Office assigned various personnel to handle all matters related to the transfer of the coffin and the funeral rites. Several inspectors led party members and Boy Scouts to maintain order. Military and police forces were deployed to maintain security inside and outside the venue.</p>
<p>▲ Funeral Arrangements: From the First Park to the cemetery, all rugged, low-lying, and waterlogged sections of the road were repaired and leveled. Wooden signs were placed along both sides of the road, adorned with party and national flags and the words "State Funeral of President Tan," to mark the route. The coffin cover was made of blue satin and trimmed with white silk tassels. The coffin was draped with an embroidered national emblem. The high carrying poles, specially made and lacquered in vermilion, were decorated with blue satin. The carrying poles were topped with party emblems. The pallbearers were hired from Hunan Province and wore neat uniforms of blue cloth with white trim. The hearse was provided by the Shanghai International Funeral Parlor, painted in black enamel and lined with blue satin and white silk tassels. At the start of the procession, the coffin was carried by pallbearers to the gate, then placed on the hearse and transported slowly to the cemetery. It was then carried by pallbearers to the burial chamber for interment.</p>
<p>▲ Central Government's Offering: At 4:30 AM, Dai Chuanxian, a standing committee member of the Central Party Headquarters, was specially dispatched to offer sacrifices before the coffin. His eulogy read: "Alas, President Tan, your life was the hope of the nation, your death the sorrow of the world. Only 357 days have passed since your passing, yet your merits and virtues have become increasingly difficult to emulate. In times of national difficulty, who would not eagerly seek to contribute, or wander on the wrong path, or rush about in confusion? You alone remained calm and composed, neither radical nor submissive, like rain and dew nourishing all things without being seen, like great rivers and mountains benefiting people without their knowledge. Now that we have lost our guide, where shall the people turn? How shall the nation be governed? Alas, you are now buried deep in the earth. We erect a tall ornamental column, plant a field of grass. Though mountains and rivers may fade, and you long knew this, we honor your virtues and merits with the highest honors of a state funeral, so that even centuries later, people will still admire and learn from you. We offer this sacrifice."</p>

Chairman Chiang also arrived at Xiaguan at 6:00 AM, where he boarded a car and proceeded to Huangpu Road to join the procession on foot. He personally presided over the funeral rites at the funeral hall.</p>
<p>▲ Cemetery Layout: From the entrance of Linggu Temple to the Lu Tomb, both sides of the road were lined with black and white cloth barriers, interspersed with circular wooden signs bearing the words "State Funeral of President Tan." Tan's tombstone, located next to Linggu Temple, was about two Zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) tall and four Chi (approximately 1.3 meters) wide, made of cement. It was inscribed with the red seal of the "Seal of Honor" and below it were the four seal-script characters of "Tomb of State Funeral." Underneath were the inscriptions "Tomb of Tan Yankai, Former Chairman of the National Government and President of the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China, Central Executive Committee Member of the Chinese Kuomintang," followed by "Respectfully Offered by Chiang Kai-shek on the Fourth Day of September in the Twentieth Year of the Republic of China." In front of the tombstone was a pool, converted from the Dragon Pool of Linggu Temple, about one Zhang deep. The pool was surrounded by a cypress leaf fence decorated with blue flowers. About half a Li (approximately 250 meters) north of the tombstone, the terrain gradually rose, with an ornamental archway bearing the horizontal inscription "The Spirit of Hengshan and Xiangjiang." A little further ahead was the construction site for a memorial hall. Before that was an open space where the coffin was transferred from the hearse to the carrying poles. The hearse, the portrait car, and the family cars stopped here. Three minutes further ahead was a square, the location of the tomb. There was a large ornamental archway with the horizontal inscription "State Funeral Ceremony." On both sides of the road were rest areas for guests and foreign visitors, decorated with black and white plain-colored strips and covered with yellow-green straw mats. Two music stands were located on either side. The funeral hall, erected on the tomb site, was further ahead.</p>
<p>▲ Funeral Hall Layout: The funeral hall was entirely constructed of reed mats, decorated with black and white fabric, and adorned with memorial scrolls. The hall was divided into two parts: the front part served as the ceremonial hall and a rest area for Central Committee members and heads of various departments, while the rear part housed the tomb. A portrait of Tan was hung behind the tomb, with wreaths from Chiang Kai-shek, Ma Fuxiang, and Niu Yongjian placed in front of it, as well as silver wreaths presented by American Minister Johnson and American Consul Peck stationed in Nanjing. Slightly forward was the tomb, constructed entirely of cement and steel, about six Chi deep, five Chi wide, and one Zhang long, with one hundred and ten Jin of realgar (one hundred Jin of Suzhou realgar and ten Jin of Ming realgar) placed underneath to absorb moisture. In the front part of the hall, on either side of the central area used for ceremonies, were rows of desks and chairs. There was also a separate rest area for family members on the left.</p>

<p>The interment ceremony was attended by all those who participated in the transfer ceremony, as well as Chiang Kai-shek, Li Liejun, Zhang Jingjiang, Shao Yuanchong, Jin Handing, Song Meiling, Zhang Mojun, Li Liejun's wife, Wang Zhengting's wife, Fang Juehui, Zhou Yawei, Jiang Zuobin's wife, Fan Guang, Tao Xuan, and others. At 10:00 AM, the vermilion coffin was placed into the golden tomb, and the interment ceremony commenced. Central Committee members, the Chairman of the National Government, heads of various Yuan and departments, and representatives from various provinces and armies gathered solemnly in the funeral hall. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, presided over the ceremony, playing mournful music, offering flowers, reading the eulogy, and delivering the interment declaration, which stated: "On this fourth day of September in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, the heads of the five Yuan, ministers of various departments, and chairmen of various committees, announce to the coffin of the late President Tan Yankai: We have selected this auspicious day to respectfully hold the state funeral and lay you to rest in this sacred place, to ensure your eternal peace. We offer incense and flowers and humbly present this farewell. May your contributions as a pillar of the nation be forever remembered under the blue sky and white sun, and may the land of dragons and tigers forever protect your resting place." After the moment of silence, the three bows were performed, the mournful music was played, and the sons offered a reply in thanks, and the ceremony was complete. Foreign guests then offered their condolences, followed by officials from various agencies and units, and finally, the family members paid their respects. After the ceremony, personnel from various agencies departed in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>▲ Key Memorial Scrolls: Memorial scrolls sent by various agencies, organizations, and important figures were displayed throughout the funeral hall and the rest areas on both sides. Here are some notable examples: (1) National Government: "You were highly respected in the government, your contributions were great to the party and nation, your name will be remembered throughout the universe, and your spirit will become a star." (2) Chairman Chiang: "You supported the falling and rescued the endangered, with a loyal heart for the party and nation. You worried about the times and grieved for the world, and millions of comrades mourn your passing." (3) Zhang Xueliang: "You were a founding hero, a rare genius in five hundred years. Your military and literary achievements were brilliant. We commend your loyalty and celebrate your glory. Across three thousand Li of distant journey, we send flowers and wine to express our sorrow." (4) Li Liejun: "The sun and moon hang suspended, ghosts and spirits weep in mourning, mountains and forests are forever closed, the court and the people are filled with grief." (5) Wu Peifu: "The roads of Sichuan are difficult, the apes of the Wuxia gorges cry tears in lines. In Changsha, we weep in pain, and the geese returning to Hengyang carry many letters." The upper inscription reads "To Brother An, President [Tan]," and the lower inscription reads "Your younger brother, Wu Peifu." (6) Yu Youren: "Embracing the two sentences of Marquis Wu, you were a complete man of the Republic of China." (7) Dai Chuanxian: "Mount Heng is majestic, towering above all mountains. The autumn wind is desolate, and a great star has fallen." (8) Hu Hanmin: "Auspicious clouds and a bright moon return to heaven, and a gentle spring breeze remains in our hearts."</p>
<h3 id="e64">Work Report from the National Government Disaster Relief Committee in Hankow <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Committee Member Li Inspects the Jiji Power Plant</p>
<p>Hongshan Shelters 170,000 Flood Victims</p>
<p>The floodwaters in Hankow have gradually receded, bringing some relief to the people. After Chairman Chiang's visit to offer condolences the other day, the Central Government specially dispatched Committee Member Li Jin to Hankow to take charge of disaster relief. Upon arriving in Hankow, Li immediately began planning the relief efforts in detail. The first step was to relocate 170,000 flood victims from the three towns of Wuhan to the vicinity of Hongshan in Wuchang and within Wuhan University, divided into several districts. Each district was assigned medical staff and police officers to prevent epidemics and maintain order. Li visits each district daily to conduct inspections. When a fire broke out at a Texaco facility a few days ago, Li personally boarded a small boat to assist in the rescue, saving hundreds of refugees. The second phase of the plan includes: (1) Establishing a temporary hospital on a large vessel that will travel to the three towns daily to provide medical treatment. Patients can also be admitted to the hospital. Funding has already been secured, and Dr. Wang Zuxiang of the Health Group has been entrusted with planning the details. (2) Renting forty large barges to serve as shelters for the flood victims, divided into five groups. In each group, five barges will serve as shelters, one will serve as an administration office, one as a cooking area, and one as a toilet. This will facilitate relief efforts and prevent the spread of epidemics. (3) Utilizing large pumps to divide the entire city into several districts and pump out the water on a district-by-district basis. During the pumping process, each district will be surrounded by sandbags to prevent the water from flowing back in after it has been pumped out. It is reported that Li greatly admires the Jiji Water and Electricity Plant in the city for its exceptional flood protection measures. Despite the floodwaters being several feet deep throughout the city, the Jiji plant continued to provide water and electricity, making a significant contribution. Therefore, he specially visited the plant yesterday with Advisor Dai and others to inspect the facilities and express his appreciation. He also plans to emulate this effort and utilize the flood victims to pump out the water within a specified timeframe. (4) Erecting wooden planks on the roads to facilitate traffic. This task has been entrusted to the Hubei Branch for speedy implementation.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Zhenjiang reports that since the collapse of more than ten Zhang (approximately 33 meters) of the Guazhou East Yangtze River bank at Majiagang on August 25th, efforts have been underway to rush construction and implement rescue measures in an attempt to repair the breach. However, after a five-day delay, no progress has been made. Currently, the floodwaters have inundated the interior of the enclosure, reaching depths of over one Zhang in low-lying areas and six to seven Chi (approximately 2 to 2.3 meters) in higher areas. People and livestock are being swept away, and homes are being submerged. The situation is extremely tragic. The scope of the disaster area extends east to the Yangzhen motor road (from Shijiaqiao to the riverside), south to the South River bank, west to the East Grand Canal embankment, and north to the inner embankment from Yangzi Bridge to Shijiaqiao. It covers a distance of fifteen Li (approximately 7.5 kilometers) from north to south and eight Li (approximately 4 kilometers) from east to west, totaling an area of one hundred and twenty square Li (approximately 60 square kilometers). Over ten thousand households, a population of sixty to seventy thousand, and over sixty thousand Mu (approximately 40 square kilometers) of farmland have been affected. The extent of the disaster and the severity of the situation are comparable to those of Gaoyou and Shaobo, except that there has fortunately not been any drowning. The flood victims in the area are exposed to the elements, hungry and cold, and mostly gathered on the embankments described above, desperately awaiting relief from the government. (3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Xu Bu Flooded Again <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Breach in the Dyke at Checun Kou in the North of the City</p>
<p>Wang Jun Issues a Notice to Protect the Old Dyke</p>
<p>A quick dispatch from Xuzhou: Xu Bu experienced continuous heavy rains in early August, causing a breach in the old course of the Yellow River and resulting in flooding. Relief efforts have been underway since then but have yet to reach everyone. Unexpectedly, on the evening of September 1st, the weather changed suddenly, and heavy rain fell again, not stopping until the morning of the 2nd. The relentless downpour caused various parts of the city to become submerged again. Places outside the city, such as the public sports field and the Martyr's Shrine in the city park, were all in the middle of the water. Countless civilian houses were flooded throughout the city. Only Zhongshan and Datong Streets remained unaffected by the water. Collapsed houses and crumbling structures were frequently reported. Those damaged by the previous heavy rain, which were undergoing repairs during the sunny days, collapsed again. The water in the old course of the Yellow River at the northeast and east gates, which had already receded several feet, overflowed the banks again, and houses along the river were submerged. According to the Construction Bureau's measurements, the rainfall in that one night was 150.5 millimeters, equivalent to 4 feet 9.7 inches in the English measurement system. The Flood Relief Committee dispatched personnel to inspect the city and telegraphed the Construction Bureau to dredge the waterways, bringing temporary safety to the city. However, the water from the Weishan Lake north of Xuzhou had already overflowed from Hunan days ago, inundating a vast area of 400 square li. Now, it continues to flow south, passing Wanzhai, located twelve li north of the city. The dyke at Checun Kou, about two li south of Wanzhai, was already in disrepair. On the morning of the 2nd, it suddenly breached amidst wind and rain. Local residents, upon discovering this, immediately gathered to reinforce the breach while reporting to the city. The Construction Bureau dispatched personnel at noon to supervise the emergency repairs, averting a major disaster. The water diverted east from Wanzhai, creating a raging torrent that entered the Jing River. Fortunately, this diversion largely protected the Checun dyke; otherwise, the area north of Bazijie would have been unimaginable. The weather cleared up on the 3rd, and there was generally no danger. However, after the second flooding, relief efforts became even more urgent. Police Commander Wang Jun, based on petitions from citizens, issued a notice to protect the old course of the Yellow River dyke to prevent flooding. The wording was extremely stern, as follows: (According to a report from Liu Zhongxin, the first district chief of Tongshan County, forwarded from citizens Wang Xiyuan, Song Mengjiu, and others, regarding the surge in river water and a proposed construction project to repair the old Yellow River dyke outside the city, requesting a prohibition against military personnel dismantling bricks and stones to prevent river disasters, etc. Based on this, it is found that the area outside Xuzhou City along the old course of the Yellow River is shaped like a cauldron. Every time the river floods, it relies entirely on the surrounding dyke to protect it, preventing the people from being submerged. All the soil, wood, bricks, and stones of the dyke are vitally important to the lives and property of the people of Xuzhou. All local residents and stationed troops should bear full responsibility for its protection. As this command is stationed here, we share the same fate. In addition to ordering the subordinate stationed troops to strictly protect and prohibit dismantling, this notice is hereby issued, urging all military and civilian personnel to be aware. Anyone who dares to dismantle even a single brick or stone of the dyke will be severely punished without leniency upon investigation or denunciation.)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Fujian Flood Victims Desperately Need Relief <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou: Due to the extraordinarily severe disaster situation in the province, the provincial government telegraphed the central government on the 27th and 28th, requesting an allocation of funds for relief. Xu Shiying, chairman of the Central Relief Committee, has already responded with a telegram. The Fujian Provincial Relief Committee also submitted a report to the provincial government, requesting that personnel be sent to various areas for inspection and publicly recommending Provincial Committee member Lin Jinan to go to Beijing to report and request a swift allocation of funds for relief. The telegram report is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Xu Shiying's Reply Telegram to Chairman Yang Youjing of the Provincial Government: Brother Youjing, greetings. Your respectful telegram has been received. Fujian Province has suffered from floods and windstorms in recent months, with over ten counties including Liancheng and Yongchun reporting and requesting relief. Reading this, my heart is filled with deep sympathy and admiration. This year's floods are exceptionally severe, and the government has established a Flood Relief Committee to provide assistance. To ensure unified authority, this committee has already submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to transfer all flood relief matters to the Flood Relief Committee for handling. I have noted the information in your telegram and forwarded it to the National Government Flood Relief Committee for review. Respectfully replying, Xu Shiying of the Relief Committee, 28th.</p>
<p>▲ Fujian Relief Committee's Report: Reporting on the matter, since the beginning of summer, the province has experienced continuous rain, causing mountain floods. Areas along rivers and low-lying areas have become submerged. On August 10th, a hurricane suddenly arose, followed by torrential rain, causing widespread devastation and darkness. Disasters occurred frequently, with wind, rain, and floods coming in rapid succession. The damage to houses, crops, fruit trees, human lives, and livestock is incalculable. The affected areas initially included Liancheng, Ningyang, Yong'an, and Minhou, followed by Xiapu, Fuding, Ningde, Gutian, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Longxi, Puzhao, Anxi, and Yunxiao counties. The number of unreported counties is unknown. Although the disaster situation is not as severe as in Jiangsu and Hubei, the people are already suffering deeply. At the tenth meeting of this committee on August 31st of this year, it was decided that the wind, rain, and flood disasters in various counties were extensive and severe. In addition to ordering the counties of Yong'an, Gutian, and Lianjiang to conduct separate investigations, personnel should be dispatched to the Fuding-Ningde area and the Zhangzhou area to investigate the disaster situation, take photos, and report via telegram. First, report to the central government and the Executive Yuan, requesting a large allocation of funds for relief. Furthermore, Committee Member Lin Jinan was recommended to report to Nanjing, requesting a swift allocation of funds, etc. In addition to handling these matters separately, we respectfully submit this report to the government for review. Respectfully presented to Yang, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government (September 1st).</p>
<h3 id="e68">Central Committee's General Report on the Wuhu Disaster Situation <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>204,000 Refugees</p>
<p>4,000 Unburied Dead</p>
<p>Ordinary Water Depth Exceeds Ten Feet</p>
<p>A dispatch from Wuhu: The flood disaster in Anhui Province is widespread and severe. The central government dispatched special commissioners Zhuang Yan and others to Anhui, dividing them into five groups for investigation. The southern and central Anhui counties were assigned to Central Committee member Qian Danwu and Wen Yi of the Provincial Department of Construction. Qian and others arrived in Wuhu and, together with representatives from the Wuhu, Fan, and Wu counties' Relief Association, chartered a special boat yesterday morning to depart from Wuhu and inspect the disaster areas of Fenglin, Xingchun, Wanchun, Sanshui, Pujia Dian, and Qingshui River. Along the way, everything was submerged in water, making it difficult to distinguish between fields and dikes, making navigation extremely difficult. Since the storm, about 4,000 refugees have been swept into the water and drowned. Floating corpses were everywhere. Countless pigs and cattle created an overwhelming stench that made people nauseous. Those trapped in the water without any means of escape used ropes and wooden objects to tie themselves to trees in an attempt to find refuge and await rescue. Qian and others, upon seeing such a tragic scene, rushed back to Wuhu that evening to telegraph the central government and the Anhui Provincial Government, reporting the actual situation of the disaster areas. They requested that Wuhu be classified as a first-class disaster area and that a large sum of money be quickly allocated for immediate relief to save the dying refugees. The general report on the disaster situation is as follows: (1) The disaster area in this county covers 2,560 square kilometers. (2) The current number of refugees is over 204,500. (3) 89,600 people have been displaced by the disaster. (4) The number of refugee deaths exceeds 4,000. (5) Property losses amount to 14 million yuan. (6) Over 498,700 mu of farmland have been flooded. (7) Crop failure is expected to result in 50,000 refugees. (8) The ordinary water depth exceeds ten feet, making it impossible to replant other crops. (9) The most urgent need now is to distribute immediate relief. (10) Since the flood, the price of rice has risen from eight yuan to thirteen yuan. After completing their work in Wuhu, the commissioners boarded a boat this morning to proceed to Fanchang (2nd).</p>
<h3 id="e69">Military Bandits Cause Havoc in Shanxi Province <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Mutiny of Troops Stationed Outside Taiyuan City</p>
<p>Bandit Forces in Various Counties Divided into Four Groups</p>
<p>A dispatch from Taiyuan: Banditry in Shanxi Province has become increasingly rampant recently. Urgent telegrams have been pouring in from various districts, indicating an unmanageable situation. At the same time, incidents of troop mutiny are still being reported. Recently, a mutiny occurred among the troops stationed at the Civil Aviation Bureau (i.e., the aviation airfield, located over twenty li outside the North Gate of Taiyuan). The combination of military and banditry has created a dire situation in Shanxi. The recent banditry situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Mutiny of Troops in Taiyuan At 1:30 AM on August 29th, a platoon leader named Zhang of the 6th Company, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Regiment of the garrison troops protecting the aircraft at the Civil Aviation Bureau outside the North Gate, suddenly led forty to fifty soldiers in a mutiny. At the beginning of the incident, they launched a surprise attack on the company commander, Guo, shooting him. Although the shot was not fatal, it caused severe injuries. A guard named Han was shot and killed. They also cut the telephone lines to prevent news from leaking. When the mutinous soldiers were shooting the company commander, Chen, another platoon leader, seeing the situation was bad, quickly ordered his platoon soldiers to prepare live ammunition. By dawn, they had found the company commander and carried him to the hospital for treatment. Upon hearing the news, the regiment immediately dispatched a battalion of troops, guided by two soldiers who had escaped, to pursue and suppress the mutineers in the direction of Xialan Village and Yangdian. The cause of the mutiny was said to be that the bureau was scheduled to pay wages on that day, and the soldiers became greedy and initiated the riot.</p>
<p>▲ Bandits of Xi County Besiege the City According to provincial government sources, there have been many reports of banditry from counties in northern and southern Shanxi in recent days. Yesterday, a telegram from Xi County reported that bandits in the county were rampant and attempting to besiege the county seat. Many wealthy families have been kidnapped for ransom, and communist bandits have infiltrated the bandit groups, distributing leaflets. Yang Yaofang has dispatched troops to pursue and suppress them overnight. Given the bandit activity in various locations, three areas have been designated, with each general responsible for suppression. However, a dedicated person is also needed to manage the overall plan. Provincial Government Chairman Chou Dai intends to telegraph Chairman Xu to return to Taiyuan as soon as possible after completing his affairs in Beiping to handle the bandit suppression in various counties. In addition, disaster relief will be provided to areas severely affected by banditry.</p>
<p>▲ Recent Situation of Military Suppression of Bandits Banditry has been rampant in various counties recently. Nine out of ten counties in southern and northern Shanxi are plagued by bandits. Artillery Supervisor Zhou Dai recently gave a talk on the recent situation of bandit suppression, stating that the bandit areas in the province can be roughly divided into four locations: (1) The Guangling-Hunyuan area, (2) the Tianzhen area, (3) the Xingxian-Linxian-Lanxian area, (4) the Puxian-Xixian area. First, the bandits in the Guangling-Hunyuan area are the mutinous soldiers of Gao Guizi's troops. Initially, there were over 300 people, who arrived at Xiaguan via Jiehuang Ridge. Commander Li Fuying was telegraphed to suppress them overnight. They then fled into Donghe and Zhen, and regrouped to Hunyuan via Gushu and Zhao Bi, with 500 to 600 people. They then fled into Yingxian Dasuinian Village, about 700 to 800 strong, gaining even greater momentum. Passing through Daiyue and other places, they reached the vicinity of Pinglu, where they gathered over a thousand more defeated soldiers. They looted Xiaoshikou in Shanyin and fled into Youyu County. This group of bandits, under the command of Commander Zhao Chengzhou, was fiercely suppressed by two cavalry regiments, an artillery company, and a battalion of infantry under Zhang Huizhao. They have never stopped, and have now left the province. Secondly, the bandits in the Tianzhen area are the notorious bandit Wang Damei, originally from Shi Yousan's troops. After their defeat, they fled to the south bank of the Sanggan River and to places such as Futugou and Panjiashan in that county, totaling several hundred people. They then fled south into Guangling County and north into Tianzhen Wujiashan. Commander Zhao Chengzhou and Commander Zhang Huizhao ordered the troops under their command to jointly suppress this group. According to recent telegrams from Zhao Chengzhou and Zhang Huizhao, the remnants of Gao's mutinous soldiers have fled to Qingshuihe in Suiyuan Province via Qidunkou, and the defeated soldiers of Shi have fled into Xinghe. It can be said that the two groups of bandits in northern Shanxi have been completely eliminated as of today. The bandits in the Xingxian-Linxian-Lanxian area are the bandits of Shaanxi origin, Ji Laoliu and others, who fled from Dadu Mountain to the Dawan Mountain and Bailong Mountain areas via Xingxian. They then fled to Dongcunzhen in Lanxian, then to Jingle and Loufanzhen. They then fled to Jierwu in Kelan and were suppressed by the county's defense forces, fleeing to Xintunbao in Ningwu. There were also over 300 bandits who fled into Lanxian from Fangshan. Dozens of mounted bandits were also located in Wanjagou. Over 300 bandits were located in the Northwest Sea area. The first battalion of the Third Security Regiment arrived and dispersed and eliminated these bandits. In addition, over 300 bandits gathered in Linxian, and over 100 bandits gathered in Hejiawan in Xingxian. Commander Yang Yaofang of Dagu and Regimental Commander Zhao of Fenyang ordered their subordinates to suppress them vigorously. Other counties, such as Xiaoyi, Zhongyang, and Wuzhai, have also experienced minor disturbances from small groups of bandits, which should not be difficult to eliminate. The bandits in the Puxian-Xixian area include six to seven hundred bandits in Laoye Ridge in Puxian and Kangchengzhen in Xi County. A total of over 2,000 bandits are in the connected mountains of Zhongyang, Shilou, Yonghe, Pu, and Xi counties. In addition, bandits from Anze fled to Shilicun in Qin County, and over 200 bandits from Fenxi plundered wantonly before fleeing to the Gongjiadian Mountains on the border of Pu, Zhao, and Fen counties. Recently, their ranks have been swelling, and Commander Yang Chengyuan and Commander Yang Yaofang have been jointly tasked with suppressing them (August 30th).</p>

<p>The South Manchurian Railway Company's Policy of Austerity Has Been Completed</p>
<p>Leaving Harbin to Go to Liaoning and then Inspect Andong</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin: President Uchida Kosai and Vice President Eguchi Sadame of the South Manchurian Railway Company, along with seventeen staff members, passed through the Ha-Man line from the Tao-Ang Road to Harbin on the evening of August 29th. The East China Railway Company dispatched staff in advance to take a special train to Ang'angxi Station to greet them. The special train arrived at the station at 9 PM on the 29th. Over 300 people, including heads of various Harbin agencies and important Japanese and Russian figures, welcomed them at the station. The station was crowded with people inside and out. The Special District Police Department and the Railway Police Department both sent large detachments of armed police to protect the station. After Uchida and his party got off the train, they met with the welcoming guests in the VIP waiting room and then went to the South Manchurian Railway Company's Harbin Office in Qinjia Gang to stay. The accompanying staff members, including Director Shoto, Kimura, Military Advisor Hayashi, Director Shanxi, Secretary Yagi, Secretary Sugiki, Section Chief Nakamura, and Section Chief Matsukura, all stayed at the North Manchuria Hotel. On the morning of the 30th, they visited the official residence of our Special District. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by the Japanese Residents Association. On the 31st, they visited the city streets and industries. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by Russian officials of the East China Railway Company. They are scheduled to leave Harbin for Changchun at 8:50 AM on the 1st. On the afternoon of the 30th, several Chinese and foreign reporters visited. According to President Uchida, "I went to Russia from Vladivostok once before and passed through Harbin. This is my second time here. However, this is the first time I have traveled by train on a Chinese state-owned railway (i.e., the Qiqihar-Taonan Railway). When I arrived in Qiqihar, I visited the Chinese city and was very satisfied. I will travel from Harbin to Changchun, then to Jilin, and return to Liaoning via the Ji-Hai Railway. I will transfer to the Bei-Ning Railway to Yingkou, and then return to Liaoning and Ning via Yingkou, transferring to the An-Feng train to Andong. I can visit all the railways in the Northeast on this itinerary. Manchuria is vast and rich in resources. The South Manchurian, East China, and Wuli Railways can all cooperate in the spirit of mutual benefit. There are many ports of export for the various railways in the three eastern provinces, such as Vladivostok, Dalian, Andong, Yingkou, and Huludao. These ports have a very important relationship to the development of the region. The South Manchurian Railway Company hopes that the Chinese railways can develop with the assistance of these ports. The South Manchurian Railway Company's layoffs have now been completed and cannot be reduced further. The details of the South Manchurian Railway Company's subsidiary business have not yet been finalized. As for the joint operation of the East, Wuli, and South Manchurian Railways, I do not know of any plans to convene a meeting in Harbin, as I left Dalian very early." (30th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Zhu Mao and Other Bandits Suddenly Flee South <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Gong, Han, and Jiang Divisions Separately Block and Suppress</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang: Zhu Mao, Peng, Huang, and other bandits recently gathered their remnants and concentrated them in the mountains near Liangcun, Longgang, Huangpi, Xiaopu, Donggu in Ningdu, Yudu, Yongfeng, and Xingguo, and in the vicinity of Gu Longgang. They launched a large-scale counterattack. After fierce suppression by the local garrison troops in battles such as Dajinzhu, Longgang, Datian, Junbu, and others, several thousand bandits were killed. Zhu Mao and others, knowing they could not succeed, changed their plans and attempted to flee to the Guangdong border. Upon receiving the report, the Command ordered the 19th Route Army to follow and pursue them, ordering the Gong, Luo, and Han divisions to set up guard on the east bank of the Wan-Tai-Gan River. They also ordered Squadron Leader Tian of the air force to lead five Douglas fighter planes to the Xingguo area to coordinate with the right-wing army and eliminate the bandits. Squadron Leader Tian telegraphed from Ji'an on the afternoon of the 28th, saying that he had taken heavy bombs and machine guns and flown to the Liantang area for reconnaissance and bombing. About five li east of Liantang, they saw three to four thousand remaining bandits in an open area, their ranks disorganized and their heads huddled together, seemingly holding a meeting. Upon seeing the plane, they were about to scatter and flee. The plane dropped over thirty heavy bombs and strafed with machine guns. The bandits fell one after another. There were probably less than a thousand survivors.</p>
<p>Because Zhu Mao planned to flee south, they ordered Huang Gonglue's pseudo-Third Army and the Xingtai pseudo-police force to commandeer dozens of civilian boats in Xikou and Hongfu and cross the river first. Gong Bingfan and Han Deqin's divisions, upon hearing the news, immediately moved horizontally between Xingguo and Taihe and sandwiched them on the opposite bank. Bandit corpses clogged the river. Han telegraphed the province yesterday to report the victory, briefly stating that over two thousand remaining bandits in the Xikou and Hongfu area commandeered boats on the morning of the 27th, attempting to cross the river and flee south. He then notified the Gong division and troops, who intercepted them at Fenghuanggang. He personally led Zhang's brigade and a regiment of Wang's brigade to ambush the bandits from behind. As the bandits were crossing the river, his troops and the Gong division's troops arrived and attacked them from across the river. The bandits in the middle of the river and on the river beaches had no cover. After five hours of fierce shooting, bandit corpses clogged the river, turning the water red. Eighteen boats were sunk. The bandits were completely annihilated in this battle. According to wounded bandits, they intended to flee to the San-Nan area. An inspection of the bandit corpses revealed that they were from the pseudo-Third Army and the Xingtai County Red Guard Police Battalion. Over 400 guns, spears, and broadswords were seized (August 30th).</p>

<p>Xu Yuanquan Personally Goes to the Front to Supervise Suppression</p>
<p>Bandits Flee into the Mountains Between Huangmei and Guangji</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou: The various counties in eastern Hubei have been quite stable since the communist bandits were suppressed. Unexpectedly, several thousand communist bandits from Yingshan in Anhui Province suddenly invaded during this flood disaster, calling themselves the pseudo-Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. They were very rampant. The county seats of Qishui and Guangji fell one after another, and they besieged the county seat of Huangmei for two days. County Magistrate Gui Fucang of the county led the militia to resist with all their might, and fortunately they were preserved. After receiving the report, He Chengjunn, Director of the Wuhan Garrison Command, immediately dispatched Supervisor Xu Yuanquan to personally supervise the suppression. Xu left on August 30th, leading Xu Jiwu's brigade and Zhang Zhenhan's division and Ding's brigade, heading straight to Qishui. At the same time, the troops stationed in Susong in Anhui Province and the troops stationed in Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province also set out separately to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression. Knowing they could not resist, the bandits abandoned Qishui and retreated to the mountains between Huangmei and Guangji, hoping to flee back to their old base in Yingshan. The people of Huangmei and Guangji have suffered both from the flood disaster and the bandit disaster, and they are all in extreme pain. It is said that they have sent representatives to Hankou to petition the Garrison Command, hoping that the suppression troops will quickly eliminate the remaining bandits to prevent future troubles, and have telegraphed the Yongsu military ship to petition Commander-in-Chief Chiang (September 1st).</p>
<h3 id="e74">Case of Yichang County Magistrate Zhao Tiegong Flogging a County Resident to Death <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The County Party Committee Petitions the Control Yuan to Impeach</p>
<p>Yichang Dispatch: Since Zhao Tiegong became the magistrate of Yichang County, accusations against him have piled up like a forest. However, due to the protection of powerful figures, the people of Yichang could do nothing about it. On July 4th, Zhao's concubine, dressed in strange attire, paraded through the market, attracting a crowd of onlookers. Three local residents, Yang Shanmei, Yang Bangmo, and Qu Linyun, also followed behind, whispering among themselves. This was overheard by Zhao's guards, who immediately arrested the three men. Zhao ordered the constables to inflict severe beatings, personally wielding the rod to flog each of them dozens of times. The three men, exhausted and speechless, were on the verge of death before being imprisoned in the main jail. The next day, Yang Shanmei died in prison from severe injuries. Lu Guojun, the Yichang prison warden, reported the matter to the Yichang District Court. The court dispatched Chief Prosecutor Wang Yanshen and Coroner Li Lianqing to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that Yang Shanmei's legs, arms, and knees were all red, swollen, and lacerated, confirming that he died from injuries. Simultaneously, it was also verified that Yang Bangmo and Qu Linyun had injuries on their arms. Prosecutor Wang immediately filled out an autopsy report, along with injury reports and oral statements, which were attached to the case file. Subsequently, Chief Prosecutor Chen Shi sent a letter to Zhao Tiegong, summoning him to court for questioning. After receiving the letter, Zhao had no choice but to reply to the court, claiming that Yang Shanmei, who died in custody due to injuries, was captured by Liu Zhongyi, the acting captain of the militia, during a patrol because the three men were allegedly engaged in robbery. Prosecutor Chen found this account to be implausible as there was no specific information about the location or victim of the alleged robbery. He sent a reply requesting that Liu Zhongyi be brought to court for questioning. At this point, Zhao realized he had made a blunder and consulted with Liu Zhongyi. Liu firmly denied the allegations. Later, a soldier named Lai Zhaoyan was presented as Liu to appear in court. During the prosecutor's interrogation, Lai Zhaoyan was told that the murderer must pay with his life. Lai Zhaoyan was terrified and confessed that he was impersonating Liu and that he was instructed to do so by Director Zhao of the airfield. Based on this testimony, the prosecutor sent another letter to Director Zhao. The county government replied, stating that no one by the name of Zhao Jingqing was currently employed, and that that person had been dismissed from his post for a long time. As a result, the court found the matter increasingly difficult to handle. Yuan Yong, a member of the Yichang County Party Committee, filed a complaint with the provincial government, accusing Zhao Tiegong of perverting the law. After receiving the complaint, Provincial Chairman He Chengjun telegraphed Yuan Bin, Chief of Staff to Liu Xiang, stationed in Yichang, inquiring whether Zhao Tiegong had indeed committed illegal acts of murder. Yuan replied by telegram, confirming the facts. Chairman He then telegraphed the Yichang Court, ordering that the case files of the Yang case be quickly transferred to the military headquarters for review. Chief Prosecutor Chen Shi immediately replied by telegram, stating that the case files of the Yang case had already been transferred to the Prosecutor's Office of the High Court. Therefore, the files were not sent to the provincial government. However, Yuan Yong, a member of the Party Committee, believed that the case had already been filed with the provincial government but had not yet yielded results. He then filed a complaint with the National Government's Control Yuan. The petition read as follows: (The case involves Zhao Tiegong's concubine. On July 4th, dressed in male Western attire, she drove through the city, passing through Gulou Street. Yang Shanmei, a shop assistant at Yifeng Store, Yang Bangmo, an apprentice tailor at Wu Youtai Tailor Shop, and Qu Linyun, found it strange and speculated whether she was a man or a woman. This was overheard by the accompanying guards, who arrested the shop assistant and apprentice and brought them to the county government where they were brutally beaten and imprisoned in the main jail. On the next day (July 5th), Yang Shanmei died in prison due to severe injuries. Yang Bangmo and Qu Linyun were also severely beaten and were on the verge of death. These facts have been reported to the Control Yuan and have been separately investigated and verified by the Yichang District Court Prosecutor's Office. However, the county magistrate has refused to appear in court, making it impossible to exercise judicial power. The Prosecutor's Office has gathered all the case files and evidence and transferred them to the Hubei High Court Prosecutor's Office for legal proceedings. Currently, during the period of political tutelage and after the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, the county magistrate, as the head of the county government, should strictly abide by laws and regulations and protect human rights. However, he abused his authority over a minor incident involving his concubine's strange appearance, disregarding human life and violating the Provisional Constitution to the extreme. The deceased's family, shop owner, and the entire population of Yichang are filled with uncontrollable indignation at Zhao Tiegong's illegal killing, but they dare not speak out due to his oppressive power. The county magistrate, aware that his crime is unforgivable, has fled to the provincial capital under the pretext of resigning. The entire population of Yichang resents Zhao Tiegong for evading justice. It is said that the Hubei Provincial Government intends to reinstate him, which is perplexing. At a time when legal rights are being negotiated, foreigners often use the poor state of Chinese law as their excuse. After news of Zhao Tiegong's illegal killing spread, consulates of various countries stationed in Yichang have been paying close attention. Yet the Hubei Provincial Government not only fails to impose severe punishment but intends to reinstate him. What is the intention? This is something that Chinese and foreigners alike cannot comprehend. How can this be called judicial reform or the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution? Is it not giving more excuses to those at home and abroad? As a party member serving in the Yichang Party Committee, Yuan Yong is heartbroken and cannot remain silent in the face of Zhao Tiegong's trampling of human life and disregard for the law. He feels compelled to uphold the Provisional Constitution, value human rights, and speak up for the people. In addition to requesting the Hubei Provincial Party Committee to send another letter to the provincial government to investigate the matter according to law, he submits this document along with a copy of the original case files and injury reports transferred from the Yichang District Court Prosecutor's Office to the Control Yuan for review. He urgently requests that the Control Yuan impeach Zhao Tiegong according to law and order the Hubei Provincial Government to arrest and investigate Zhao Tiegong, who is arrogant, reckless, and inhumane, in order to uphold justice and redress grievances. He awaits orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted to President Yu of the Control Yuan of the National Government, Yuan Yong, Member of the Yichang County Party Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party. (Original case files and injury reports transferred from the Yichang District Court Prosecutor's Office omitted.)</p>

<p>Local Figures Request Arrest of Remaining Bandits: The bandit leader Lu Yaosheng, a former pseudo-regimental commander under the bandit leader Taibao Ashu, used to make a living selling salt along the coast of Jinshan. After meeting Taibao Ashu last year, he gathered dozens of followers and joined the bandit ranks. He was captured by the Fengxian County police and has been sent to the Songjiang Pacification Sub-district Command for interrogation. However, local figures in Songjiang and Jinshan believe that although the bandit Lu has been arrested, his henchmen are hiding in various towns in Punan, Tinglin, Shanyang, and Zhalin. If a strict arrest is not carried out in a timely manner, it may lead to future troubles. They have compiled a list of the names of the escaped bandits and submitted it to the military and police authorities, requesting a thorough search and arrest.</p>

<p>Central Committee Member Cai Yuanpei Leaves Ningbo for Beijing: Mr. Cai Yuanpei, a member of the Central Committee, came to Ningbo the day before yesterday at the invitation of Ma Yinchu, the president of the Chinese Economic Society, to give a speech. This morning (the 3rd) he took the early train to Hangzhou and then transferred to Beijing.</p>
<p>Encircling and Suppressing New Bandit Gangs: Xu Mazhan Village in Lianshan District, Fenghua, has repeatedly received threatening letters from bandit leader Mao Pengxing, instructing them to raise six thousand yuan in silver dollars immediately, causing great panic among the people of the village. Village Chief Wang Changyang reported the information to the county. County Magistrate Zhang ordered the County Militia to suppress them. Captain Mao ordered the deputy captains stationed at Yantouxia, Shimen Huxiao Tushao, Wanwan, Dajian, and Jianxia, to encircle and suppress the bandits at Wangshakeng on August 31st. However, there were no traces of bandits, so they all returned to their defense posts. The Ying Family in Jinyun was Robbed: Ying Jinyun, a resident of Dachengjia Road in Dinghai Village, Fifth District of Yuyao, made a living by drying salt and was relatively well-off. At midnight on the 31st of last month, five or six bandits suddenly came, broke down the door with pistols in hand, and searched wildly. They also tied up Jinyun and demanded five hundred yuan. After Jinyun knelt on the ground and begged, he borrowed from all sides and managed to raise the sum. The bandits got the money and released Ying and fled to the northeast.</p>

<p>New Prices for New Flue-Cured Tobacco: New flue-cured tobacco has come on the market in Xiaoshao Guali Kanshan sandy land. Due to the wind and rain disasters recently, the late planting has suffered losses. The industry decided by the Anchang Flue-Cured Tobacco Industry Association that the price is fifteen yuan and four jiao per hundred catties (sixteen tael scale). The market still needs to see an increase. In addition, the flue-cured tobacco in the four western townships this year's harvest season is very poor, and due to the hot weather and more rain than sun, most of it cannot be dried and is mostly moldy. It has been reported that the market price of new tobacco is from fifteen yuan to eighteen yuan, and there is no good product.</p>

<p>Another Major Fire at Ximatang: Ding's grocery store at Ximatang, the Sixth Girls' Middle School, caught fire at 4 PM on the 26th due to frying peanuts. The fire immediately spread to the roof and affected the home of Li Zihe to the east, and also spread to the neighbors. Fortunately, the fire was put out by the fire hydrants and the Public Security Bureau. It is estimated that twenty to thirty houses were burned, totaling about eighty rooms. Several of the families had moved here after the previous major fire in the west gate, which is truly unfortunate.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3 id="e86">Letter from All Police Officers of the Fourth Precinct of Songjiang County <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Respected Editor: The news articles "The patrol captain surrounds the district chief to demand salary" and "Details of insulting the district chief" that were published in your newspaper on the 30th and 31st of last month are completely inconsistent with the facts. Upon reading them, we were deeply surprised. The police salaries of the Fourth Precinct of Songjiang City have always been allocated from the housing police donations collected by the First District Office and paid out on the 10th of the following month. Everything has been in order. However, since June, the salaries have been delayed until the 25th of the following month. For the police officers, their salaries are used for living expenses. Every time the salary is due, they are looking forward to it like a drought expecting rain. Unexpectedly, the police salaries for July were delayed until August 25th and were still not paid out. The police officers heard that the housing police donations for July had already been collected, and those for August had also been collected. Therefore, they asked the police inspector and the bureau chief to repeatedly request the payment. However, District Chief Zhong Taishi ignored them. Later, the county magistrate ordered the salaries to be paid quickly, but he still ignored the order. On August 29th, the police inspector had no money to cover the meals, and all the police officers were on the verge of starvation. The police inspector had no choice but to go to the District Office again to urge the payment. However, District Chief Zhong was angered by the police inspector's repeated urgings and slammed the table, yelling, "What are you? How dare you speak?" The police inspector returned without any results. He told the police officers about the situation. The police officers believed that District Chief Zhong would not be so unreasonable and unconcerned for his subordinates. They were still suspicious. Later, on the suggestion of everyone, several patrol captains were elected to accompany the police inspector to the District Office to verify the situation. When they went, the police inspector still politely requested District Chief Zhong. The patrol captains had received training and strictly maintained order when disbursing funds. They did not dare to say anything outrageous. In the end, no money was paid out. On the contrary, the District Office falsely accused the patrol captains of insulting the district chief to the County Government and the Public Security Bureau. The patrol captains are of low status and small jobs and could not do anything. They only feel that the administrative staff under the Party rule are still overbearing and sigh with emotion. It should be known that the police salaries are borne by all the merchants and residents of the city, but the District Office collects and disburses them. Other than a dozen districts, all districts do the same. We have not heard of anyone failing to pay the police salaries clearly until the third month. As of yesterday (September 2nd), the salaries had still not been paid out. Now, your newspaper publishes Zhong District Chief's solo responsibilities in the house police donations and how he contributed to the allocations. This kind of statement seems to imply that the police salaries are maintained by Zhong District Chief personally. It is also said that he has accumulated nearly two thousand gold coins. According to the budget revenue and expenditure, it was approved by the county-wide administrative meeting and reported for approval. There is no shortage. Even if there is such a thing, why did Zhong District Chief not apply to the County Government for remedy earlier? Now the sudden cut off of the police officers' living expenses is so handled, how can it be said to be legal? The above situation has long been publicly evaluated by various agencies and local figures in Songyi. There is no need to argue. However, because your newspaper's reporting is inaccurate, we will briefly describe the situation and facts. We have always known that your newspaper's public opinion is fair and does not damage its reputation due to personal feelings. We hope you will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth. The police officers of the Fourth Precinct of Songjiang County, together, September 3.</p>

<p>More than a Thousand People Attended</p>
<p>Yesterday, various circles in this city held a national funeral ceremony for the late President Tan.

The Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee wrote (For years, he traveled tirelessly for the revolution, rejoicing in the transformation of the world. The golden vase is intact, and his name is marked in history. From afar, we admire the outstanding figure and the abundant spirit of Hengyue. Hundreds of thousands of administrative affairs have been reorganized, lamenting his diligence for the Party and the country, not even eating or sleeping. The great star falls from the sky, how sad the wind and cold moon is! His heroic soul forever weeps at Zhongshan). The Garrison Headquarters wrote (Building a tomb like Qilian, we all look up to the glory and recall the red shadow, sending Hui and leaving a stone room, knowing that joy and sorrow are tied to the common people). Other elegiac couplets from various circles are very touching, so they are omitted here. The memorial oration is also omitted for its length.</p>
<p>▲ People Who Paid Respects: Leaders from various circles who attended included Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chen Xizeng, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Wu Kaixian, Member of the Municipal Party Committee, Wang Xiaolai, Member of the City Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Baoli, Representative of the Garrison Headquarters, Wang Xundi, Representative of the Shanghai Local Court, Ying Shi, President of the Second Special District Court, Liang Renjie of the Jiangsu High Court Third Branch, as well as representatives from various agencies, organizations, and schools, no less than one thousand people.</p>

<p>Two Batches of Disaster Victims from Hubei and Jiangxi Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Office for Disaster Victims in Nanshi received reports from the Railway Bureau and China Merchants Bureau at 4 AM yesterday, stating that a large number of refugees had arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, the office immediately dispatched staff and public security police to receive and accommodate them. The details of the arrival and a glimpse of the disaster victims are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Jiangshun Arrived in Shanghai: The Jiangshun of the China Merchants Bureau arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying more than 120 disaster victims from Heyang and Hankou in Hubei. At about 9 AM, they were received and guided to the Liuying Road shelter in Zhabei by the office. Most of them had sunken eyes and tattered clothes. They were mostly villagers from the neighboring counties of Wuhan who relied on farming for a living. It was heard that they had not been frozen or starved on the ship. The comprador on the ship had cooked more than ten baskets of rice and distributed it to the disaster victims.</p>
<p>▲ Train Carried Another Batch of Disaster Victims: Another batch of disaster victims, about sixty from Fengyang, Anhui, were carried by train from Nanjing by the Railway Bureau. Because there were too many disaster victims from Jiangxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Anhui being accommodated in various places in Nanjing, there was almost no room left. Shanghai was specially ordered to receive them. They carried children and luggage, and their situation was quite tragic. They originally wanted to take the same train to Hangzhou to take refuge. However, when the train arrived, two girls, Chen Dadaizi and Chen Xiaodaizi, were lost at the station, so they got off the train to look for them. Later, they were guided to the corner of Xiaoximen by the police, where passers-by distributed relief rations of steamed buns. It was said that they planned to take a train to Hangzhou at the South Station, but the two missing children had not yet been found.</p>

<p>(1) Telegram from Baoying: To Chairman Zhu Zhen of the State Council Relief Association Working Group, Chairman Xu, Standing Committee of the Urgent Relief Association Yu Wang Wu, and Chairman Wang Huang of the Jiangsu Relief Association: Baoying is flooded again, the water is rising violently, and the embankment has collapsed for many years. All the weirs in the northeastern countryside have been broken. The number of deaths is difficult to estimate. The city is fortunately safe. The original post office refugee shelter has been renamed refugee shelter, and efforts are being made to send boats to rescue people. Please quickly transport rice and flour to the town. Respectfully, Jingsheng. East. (2) Telegram from Zhenjiang: To Mr. Yilao of the Renji Hall Jiangsu Relief Association: I, De Sui Yiqing, arrived in Zhenjiang late. Yan is escorting a wheel to You to rescue disaster victims. Saw the breach in the east embankment of the Shaobo Great King Temple, and more than half of the entire town was washed away. Several breaches in the Zhaoguan Dam. Arrived in You in the afternoon and found four breaches at Yuma Pier and Dangjunlou. Although the danger to Youcheng has passed, the autumn flood is worrying. A batch of refugees was transported to Yang, and four villages were rescued. Respectfully, Jin Shude, winter. (3) Telegram from Yangzhou: To Mr. Yilao Han of the Jiangsu Flood Disaster Relief Association: I have received your telegram. The disaster situation in the Shaobo rural area, which is located in a remote area, is particularly serious. The tragic state is unbearable to witness. Those who come to seek assistance are constantly coming. The urgent relief is as urgent as a shooting star. Your telegram requested 10,000 yuan, which is far from enough. Please allocate another 10,000 yuan, totaling 20,000 yuan, and allocate 3,000 bags of flour. Please remit and transport them quickly. Looking forward to your reply. Respectfully, Cao Yueshen, Yuan Jimei, winter. (4) Telegram from Yangzhou: To Chairman Song Ziwen of the Flood Relief Committee, Chairman Xu Jingren of the Relief Affairs Committee, the Presidium of the All-Provinces Flood Disaster Urgent Relief Association, and the Jiangsu Flood Disaster Relief Association: Zhi Jiang and I, Shichen, took boats and dry food to inspect the disaster-stricken areas in person and provide urgent relief. I sent a telegram from Yan Shu to your attention. This afternoon, I returned to the office from the disaster areas of Shaobo and Gaoyou. I witnessed the breaches in the river embankment. There are four breaches in Shaobo, totaling about 170 zhang: 20 zhang at the Gongdian, 60 zhang at the Yumatou, 50 zhang at the Hehuatang, 90 zhang at the Dangjunlou, and 60 zhang at the Yumatou. The water rushes straight in, and the current is extremely turbulent. The angry waves roar wildly, and boats cannot get close. The upstream and downstream are a vast expanse of water, almost like the sea, pouring down thousands of miles, beyond the reach of the eye. There are occasional high mounds that are slightly exposed, like isolated islands in the ocean, appearing and disappearing in the vast smoke and waves, which are impossible to reach. After the water passes, houses are flooded and collapse, and deaths under the belly of fish are often heard. The loss of life and property is difficult to count. This is the situation in the Gaoyou area. As for Xinghua and other counties, which are located at the bottom of the pot, transportation is cut off, and special personnel have been sent to visit them. There is still no news. The tragic situation is extremely painful. Now the surviving people have no home to return to, and they are cramped in the wilderness, shivering in the autumn wind. The refugees are difficult to describe. I am ashamed that I do not have Zheng Xia's map. I frequently call out to Jiang Bo and imitate the tongue of Guang Chang. I humbly ask for early compassion and swift relief, coming from a source and the more the better. I cannot help but bow to the disaster victims nine times. Respectfully, Zhang Zhijiang, east. (5) Telegram from Liuzhuang: To the Jiangsu Flood Disaster Relief Association: After the Yun Dam was released, the Yun Embankment continued to collapse. The flood arrived violently, and the water level rose several feet sharply on Yan night. In the winter, the fierce wind and rain caused the water to increase continuously. All the weirs were flooded, the fields and crops were submerged, the houses were washed down, and the people drowned. Now a temporary life-saving association has been formed, and refugee shelters have been set up to temporarily relieve the immediate emergency. I earnestly request the association to send personnel to investigate and provide urgent relief as soon as possible. It is a matter of life and death. Respectfully, the Liuzhuang Flood Disaster Temporary Life-Saving Association, Jiang. (6) To the Jiangsu Flood Disaster Relief Association: We have just received reports from various counties that Xinghua and Dongtai are completely submerged in the province, the entire village of Yancheng is flooded, and the water in Taixian has reached the edge of the city. Disaster victims are gathered everywhere. The Yun Embankment in Taizhou has more than a dozen breaches, and the water is still pouring down. Officials are celebrating the reduction of water in You and Shao, but they do not know that the reduction of water upstream is the subsidence of land downstream. Colleagues are shouting until they are exhausted, and they want to cry without tears. We once again earnestly request all parties to unanimously advocate for awakening the authorities, blocking the breaches as quickly as possible, and raising funds for relief and saving lives together. It is extremely urgent. Respectfully, the Salt Yufu Tai Dong Xing Flood Disaster Relief Association stationed in the town, east. (7) Telegram from Xiaoxian: To the Jiangsu Provincial Relief Association: Since the summer of this year, Xiaoxian has suffered repeated torrential rains and floods. The water in the city is four to five feet deep, and boats are needed to enter the market. All areas are in a huge flood, and the autumn crops have been completely submerged. Many livestock drowned. Special personnel have been sent to various areas to investigate. According to statistics, 1,383 villages have been flooded, more than 17,000 hectares of fields and crops have been flooded, 12,980 houses have collapsed, losses are more than 10 million yuan, and 90,000 people have been affected. 25 people drowned. The disaster situation is extremely serious and there are too many disaster victims. I implore your association to send personnel to the county for investigation as soon as possible, allocate a large amount of money, and provide urgent relief to prevent the old and weak from dying in the ditches and the young and strong from taking risks. I am extremely grateful. (8) Letter from the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai: Received a telegram from County Magistrate Du of Yancheng: Yanyi is located downstream, and the Yun Embankment has collapsed. The fields are one zhang or seven or eight feet deep. The young and strong are climbing trees to wait for rescue, and most of the women and children have drowned. The houses have been destroyed, and the cooking has been cut off. The tragic situation is unbearable to speak of.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Most Dire Disaster Situation in Xinghua <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Xinghua Fellow Villagers Association believes that the water disaster in their hometown is extremely serious, and telegrams are no longer working. Fellow villagers in Shanghai are very concerned, but they do not know the true situation. The association specially sent personnel to return to their hometown to inspect. They departed the night before and sent a letter from Zhen yesterday, saying that they had read a telegram from Xingdai at a friend's place in Zhen, which said (arrived in Xing at noon, the water level along the way is still rising, and there is no dry land in the entire area. Disaster victims are gathered, and there is a shortage of rice and grain. Li Junjun went to Yang and the money has not arrived and is in Li's hand. Mao You River is open and is now being strongly blocked by Dafeng Yuhua. Another telegram was sent to the province to petition. Specially heard.) This telegram was sent from Xing by a special person to Taixian and then forwarded to Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Origin of the Taicang Fellow Villagers Association's Request for Relief <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Taicang Fellow Villagers Association issued a request for relief yesterday, saying that Heaven does not pity us, and floods are causing disasters. Various provinces have reported emergencies one after another, and Taicang is also suffering from this disaster. Taicang County is located on the east coast of the sea and the west end of Tai Lake. It is known as the land of water. The western countryside is shaped like the bottom of a pot. Once there is more rain, the harvest will be reduced. Therefore, the residents there rarely have savings, and the cry for assistance is often heard. Since the beginning of summer this year, there have been continuous rains, and the western water has been heavy. The fields and crops have been</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>submerged, and the houses have been washed away. Not only is there no harvest, but the clothes, food, and housing are all lacking. The sight of people crying for food and sleeping in the open is everywhere. After on-site investigation, the first, sixth, and eighth districts of the county, namely the old Huchuan, Shuangfeng, Mao市,　叶, Xinfeng, and Zhitang townships, have suffered the most. The disaster of this scale has never happened before. The disaster-stricken fields and crops have reached more than 100,000 mu, and most of them have no harvest. The disaster-stricken houses have reached hundreds of families, and they have all been displaced. On August 25th, the coastal area was hit by a storm surge, which destroyed more than 500 zhang of the sea embankment. Dozens of nearby residents were also destroyed, and the disaster situation is the same. Since the incident, the local government has organized a flood disaster relief committee, but the disaster situation is very serious, and I am deeply afraid that it is just a drop in the bucket. We rely entirely on raising funds from various sources to provide rescue. The fellow villagers are concerned about their hometown and cannot ignore the situation. After a meeting and discussion, in addition to considering the funds at the scene, we believe that gathering strength can achieve success, and accumulating sand can make a tower. I implore all kind people from all walks of life to generously donate and help as much as they can. A thousand taels is not too much, and one wen is not too little. A few more wen can save one more life, and saving one day means fewer people will die. This can inspire heaven and earth and save the catastrophe. The merits and virtues are limitless. We respectfully bow to all the disaster victims in the county nine times and ask for your urgent words. Please be aware of this.

<p>The Anhui Flood Disaster Relief Association in Shanghai, because the disaster situation in Anhui Province is particularly serious, even more tragic than in Jiangsu and Hubei, invited the Shanghai press to the New New Restaurant at 3 pm yesterday, including Zhang Zhuping, Wang Boqi, Wang Yingbin, Yu Kongwo, Yuan Yeyu, etc. Xu Shiying, Guan Yunnong, Xu Jingren, Yu Langxi, Wang Baozhai, and other ten members of the Standing Committee of the association hosted everything. First, Chairman Xu Shiying reported the disaster situation in 48 counties in Anhui Province. Due to traffic congestion and undeveloped people, there is a lack of propaganda. I hope that the press will provide more guidance so that the disaster victims in each county can be rescued earlier. Guan Yunnong said, (1) This association is very cautious about disaster relief and fundraising. All donations received will be used for disaster relief. The association's affairs and entertainment expenses are all recognized by colleagues. (2) The release of relief funds will be assigned to familiar with disaster relief and impartial personnel designated by the association to distribute in the disaster areas, without any handling to avoid abuses. Liu Lian in northern Anhui, Xu Pinxian in central Anhui, and Wu Songting in southern Anhui, etc. It is also hoped that all sectors will supervise at any time so that the disaster victims will benefit without any bias. Finally, Zhang Zhuping gave a reply on behalf of the association, and the meeting adjourned at 5 pm.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Recent Disaster Situation in Various Counties in Anhui <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>This national flood has particularly affected Anhui Province. The following is a summary of the disaster reports received by the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, the All-Provinces Flood Disaster Urgent Relief Association, etc.</p>
<p>▲On the 14th of last month, the Huangsitan Dam in Wuwei collapsed. All 940 large and small weirs in the county were submerged. Countless people, livestock, and houses were washed away. Corpses swelled, decayed, and smelled unbearably like ducks. Until now, the wind and waves are still shaking. The 260-mile single embankment along the river is fighting for life with the water. If it is not repaired, it will become a permanent giant mooring, which is related to the seven counties of Lu and He. According to statistics, 121,400 households and 746,770 people were affected in the nine districts of the county. 350,720 people are homeless, and 416,270 people are in urgent need of relief. 1,496,070 mu of farmland have been flooded. The harvest in the first, fourth, fifth, and third districts this year is completely hopeless. In other districts, at most, only 1% can be harvested.</p>
<p>▲In Chaoxian, there were continuous heavy rains for six or seven days last month, and the lake water rose sharply by two zhang. A total of 166 weirs in the entire territory, totaling more than 360,000 mu of fields, the dikes collapsed, and the fields and crops were submerged. The water in the city was several feet deep.</p>
<p>▲In Xuancheng, all 200 weirs in the county collapsed completely. Taking Xihe Town as an example, more than 50 houses were washed away, and more than 1,000 people drowned. Party and government agencies raised more than 6,000 yuan to provide temporary relief, which is far from enough. In addition, the Xihe Shenggong Weir, Luogong Weir, Wancun Weir, Baoxing Weir, and other hundreds of miles are a vast expanse of water, and the disaster is particularly serious.</p>
<p>▲In Jixi, after heavy rain last month, it was hit by a strong wind on the 26th, followed by hail. The water was more than eight feet high, and people and animals were drowned.</p>
<p>▲In Xiuning, there was heavy rain from the 18th of last month. The water was one zhang high in low-lying areas. People could not escape, climbed on the roof and shouted for help. The walls collapsed, and the grain was empty. The disaster-stricken villages reached more than 80, more than 2,000 mu of fields were flooded, and hundreds of houses collapsed.</p>
<h3 id="e98">News from the Red Cross Society on Disaster Relief <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>

<p>▲Telegram urging Priest Rao to go to Yang: Priest Qian Jiaju, the western president of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, set off for Hankou last month to handle urgent relief matters. Now, the flood disaster in Jiangbei is even more serious than in Wuhan. Vice President Gu Jisheng and others of the association have already set off for Yang, but the disaster area is relatively wide. Therefore, the association telegraphed Han yesterday, urging Priest Rao to transfer to Yangzhou to handle urgent relief in Jiangbei.</p>
<p>▲Setting up donation boxes for flood disasters: The association recently prepared many donation boxes for flood disasters and sent them to Shui'an, Xianshi, and Xinxin yesterday, set up in appropriate places to make customers feel shocked and happy to donate, accumulating sand to form a tower, and should be able to save many disaster victims.</p>
<p>▲Overseas Chinese generously donate large sums: Yesterday, the association received several donations remitted by overseas Chinese: (1) Guangdong Bank in New York remitted donations from three overseas Chinese, Yuan, Wu, and Chen, one for 1,150 yuan, one for 3,000 yuan, and one for 3,040 yuan; (2) Citizens of Honolulu remitted 11,000 yuan for relief; (3) The Ontario Overseas Chinese Flood Disaster Relief Association in Canada remitted 5,000 foreign yuan.

<p>▲Soliciting clothes and quilts: According to the office of the French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, which was established to solicit clothes and quilts for disaster victims, it has already started working. In recent days, citizens from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated all their cotton clothes and quilts.</p>
<p>▲The Superintendent of the French Concession, Fevrier, replies in a direct reply: Received a letter stating that the flood disaster in various provinces is extremely serious and that relief should not be delayed. Therefore, he convened a meeting of the executive supervisors on the 31st of last month to organize a disaster relief committee, and decided to produce pictures of disaster victims and various fundraising texts for posting and distribution within the concession. Please inform all police stations that in the event of posting and distributing the above pictures and texts, please do not misunderstand. Also, please transfer to the advertising tax office to exempt advertising tax, etc. After investigation, the pictures of disaster victims and fundraising texts are related to good deeds and are allowed to be posted and distributed within the concession. However, more than ten copies of each of these pictures and texts must be sent to this office for redistribution to the police stations as sample sheets. Those that should be posted must be sent to the advertising tax office of this office for free stamping. Correspondingly reply, I hope you will investigate and deal with it accordingly. Best regards to the French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, Fevrier, stamped, September 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e101">A Refugee Hospital Ship Organized by Foreigners Will Go to Han <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The disaster relief committee organized by foreigners in this port chartered the Hannan Moller of the Moller Company as a refugee hospital ship for sick refugees after a meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd. The ship was scheduled to sail into the Jiangnan Shipyard for conversion yesterday morning. Once the work is completed, it plans to rush to Hankou. The ship has a deadweight of 3,300 tons and can accommodate between 150 and 200 sickbeds. In addition, there are 10 small rooms and one large dining room, which can be used by police officers. Renji Hospital has agreed to send three doctors to serve on the ship, with Dr. Robert Benson as the director, assisted by Dr. Thomson and Dr. Maxswell. Or two health inspectors will be sent to handle cleaning and prevent infectious diseases. After the ship arrives in Han, it will cooperate with the medical staff in the port to carry out everything. The local Kehua Pharmacy has donated 3,000 taels of silver for the purchase of medicines. However, this move requires a lot of money, and I hope that philanthropists will contribute to the good cause. The conversion project of the ship can be completed in about five or six days. Then it will be loaded with coal and rush to Han. The 400 tons of coal needed has been recognized by the Kailuan Coal Mine Company.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Mao Heyuan Discusses the Ning Shao Relief Team's Journey to Wuhan <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Ning Shao fellow villagers' emergency relief association for the Wuhan disaster sent the Xin Ning and Yong Xing steamers to Wuhan to carry fellow villagers for assistance. Both ships have arrived in Ningbo one after another. All members of the relief team sent by the association to Wuhan returned to Shanghai on the first of this month. Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Mr. Mao Heyuan, the director of the team, at the Ningbo fellow villagers association, who made the following statement. The reporter asked, "We heard that the Xin Ning and Yong Xing steamers were not crowded with fellow villagers on their way down from Wuhan. What was the reason for this?" Mr. Mao replied, "There were two trips for fellow villagers returning to their hometowns, totaling about 1,500 people. The reason is that after the 23rd, the floodwaters receded day by day, and people's hearts gradually settled down. Most fellow villagers were unwilling to leave Wuhan easily due to property and job concerns, so the ships were not very crowded. " The reporter also asked, "It seems that fellow villagers in Shanghai have some criticisms of the gentlemen who went to Wuhan. Have you heard of this?" Mr. Mao replied, "I heard about it as soon as I arrived in Shanghai, but the facts are all there, and I think the rumors will soon subside. Mr. Xie Qigang and Mr. Hong Xuefan and I usually pay attention to personal hygiene. When we took the Longhe ship to Wuhan, we sat in the first-class cabin, but the cabin fare and liquor expenses were all paid by ourselves. As for the drinking water and food we brought, we couldn't prepare much at the beginning because the Hua Wu ship had no facilities, so some of it can still be returned. The expenses were also paid by ourselves, without using public funds. Compared to the charitable leaders of various charitable organizations who practice frugality and self-discipline, I am indeed far inferior. However, I dare to ask myself that I did not waste public funds, and I believe that fellow villagers will understand. The round trip took a total of eleven days and cost more than 2,100 yuan, and I have instructed Mr. Chen, the accountant of our team, to prepare a detailed report," he said.</p>

<h3 id="e104">German Cargo Ship Hits a Reef <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Pachenland Ship</p>
<p>Runs Aground Due to Fog</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was fog on the sea. The cargo ship of the German company Xiangbao in this port, while sailing from Japan to Shanghai, encountered fog and hit a reef. The Shanghai office is already trying to rescue the ship. The information obtained is reported as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Location of the Grounding</p>
<p>The German company Xiangbao's cargo ship, the Pachenland, is a newly built Sino-German liner with a deadweight of 9,000 tons. The engine uses a new type of motorcycle engine and is dedicated to the Xiangbao Shanghai route. This time, the ship came to Shanghai from Germany. After unloading the goods, it went to Japan, and then went to North China to transport soybeans and other miscellaneous grains to Shanghai. It was scheduled to export from Shanghai on the 11th. However, the ship sailed out of Kobe, Japan, and at 3:05 pm yesterday, it arrived at 126 degrees 10 minutes east longitude and 34 degrees 04 minutes north latitude, near Pokusa Island. The ship planned to temporarily stop to avoid the fog, but it had already deviated from the channel, and the hull collided with a reef near the island, damaging the bottom of the ship.</p>
<p>▲ Ship Owner's Report</p>
<p>After the ship accident, the ship owner, Mr. Diniq, reported that the hull had hit a reef, the bottom of the ship was broken, and seawater had entered the cabin. The ship owner urgently sent a wireless SOS signal. The Wu Song Coast Radio Station of the Ministry of Transportation accepted the message and immediately transferred it to the Hengbao Company on Guangdong Road. The company sent a telegram to inquire about the cause of the accident and the extent of the damage. At about 6:00, the ship owner's reply arrived. The manager of the company personally translated and read it, and immediately discussed the rescue.</p>
<p>▲ Sending a Ship for Rescue</p>
<p>After the news of the ship accident reached Shanghai, the manager of Hengbao Shipping Company was still discussing the matter in the company late at night and decided to send a ship to the site for rescue. It is said that the company plans to ask Huidefeng in this port to first send a large tugboat to the location of the Pachenland accident to try to tow it. They will also send personnel to inspect the damage to facilitate repairs and fill the holes, and then tow it. The export date of the ship has already been postponed.</p>
<h3 id="e105">News of the Zhaoxing Ship Accident Rescue <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>All Crew and Passengers Are Safe</p>
<p>▲ Repairs in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Zhaoxing ship of the Zhaoxing Company in this port, which originally operated on the Yangtze River route, stopped in Lushun for ship repairs due to the shortage of goods in Wuhan caused by the flood. The entire repair has now been completed. It loaded soybeans, miscellaneous goods, and passengers in Yingkou and sailed to Shanghai on the 1st. On the afternoon of the 2nd, when the ship arrived at Qingshan Head on the Shandong Sea, the ship received a weather telegram stating that a hurricane would occur on the sea. The ship's captain, Zhang Jidan, in order to prevent harm, ordered the ship to sail to Shidao Bay to avoid the wind. Unexpectedly, before entering the bay, it ran aground on a reef.</p>
<p>▲ The Truth About the Grounding</p>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd, the Zhaoxing ship sailed to Shidao and was about to enter the sea to drop anchor to avoid the wind. Unexpectedly, it ran aground on a reef outside Shidao Bay. The bow cabin of the Zhaoxing ship was pierced by the reef, and seawater rushed into the bow cabin.</p>
<p>The ship's captain, Zhang Jidan, sent a telegram for help. Considering that the ship was aground on the reef and the hull was very dangerous, and deeply worried that seawater would flood the cabins, which would cause the ship to sink, he immediately reversed and ventured to drive the ship onto a nearby beach, so that the hull was aground on the beach to avoid the danger of sinking. Yesterday, a telegram was received stating that the ship was safer in the shallow sand on the coast.</p>
<p>▲ Sending Ships to Help</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the company sent a telegram to Yingkou yesterday, ordering the Huyu liner Hexing, which is currently sailing, and the Yingkou Yantai liner Rongxing to rush to Qingshan Head Shidao Bay to rescue the Zhaoxing. Yesterday, the Shanghai office continued to receive a telegram stating that the Rongxing ship had arrived in Shidao first and decided to unload the cargo inside the Zhaoxing ship and carry it to Shanghai instead, so that the Zhaoxing could reduce its load. Then, it would repair the broken holes, pump out the accumulated water, and then tow it for rescue. The Hexing ship is expected to arrive there today to assist in the rescue.</p>
<p>▲ Crew and Passengers Are Safe</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chen Ganqing, the general ship owner of the company, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the cargo in the bow cabin of the Zhaoxing ship has been damaged by water and suffered losses, but the passengers and employees on the ship are all safe and sound. The Rongxing has arrived and is expected to transfer the cargo and passengers to Shanghai. Although the Zhaoxing ship ran aground, the crisis has passed and it can be towed to safety. The ship will resume the Yangtze River route after the floodwaters in Hankou recede slightly, he said.</p>

<p>To the Tenth Day of the Tenth Month of the Eighth Year</p>
<p>The Chinese Kuomintang has a long history. Since the Xingzhong Society until now, it has undergone several reorganizations, and its name has also changed with the reorganizations. According to the current Chinese Kuomintang, it was reorganized from the Chinese Revolutionary Party. The date of reorganization has now been verified by the Central Committee as the tenth day of the tenth month of the eighth year of the Republic of China, not November of the ninth year of the Republic of China. The Third District Party Department of this city has been ordered to instruct its subordinates to make corrections accordingly.</p>

<p>Min Weixin, Huang Jingqun</p>
<p>Min Weixin, a standing committee member of the executive committee of the Kuomintang branch in Xijin, and Mr. Huang Jingqun, the dean of studies at Zhongshan Public School, were both expelled from the country. Mr. Min left Xijin by ship on the 13th of last month and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Su Xin'an sent multiple telegrams to the Central Party Department, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate, and specially sent Feng Hanyue to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All telegram drafts and documents for the negotiations were inspected by Wei Xingmin, the Hanwu Division of Yicheng, in early November last year. They were deemed to violate the laws of the Dutch East Indies and were detrimental to public security. After repeated interrogations, Mr. Min was ordered to be monitored by Ding police, fingerprinted, photographed as a prisoner, and his residence permit was confiscated. He was also required to sign in at the police station at a fixed time every day for ten months before being ordered to leave the country on August 13 this year. Mr. Huang was the former principal of Zhongshan Public School. In early November last year, Wei Xingmin, the Hanwu Division of Xijiang, came to Xijin and made many harsh demands on the school's facilities and equipment. In early February this year, when the local government of Xijiang went to investigate textbooks, they took the opportunity to imprison him. Mr. Huang was imprisoned for eight days, wearing yellow clothes, eating yellow rice, and doing coconut shell work every day. In early March, the Xijiang authorities ordered that Mr. Huang be strictly interrogated, and then his residence permit was confiscated, fingerprinted, photographed as a prisoner, and police officers were dispatched to monitor his actions. He was required to sign in at the police station at a fixed time every day for five months before being expelled from the country on August 13.</p>

<p>Plan to Prevent the Spread of Infectious Diseases by Disaster Victims Coming to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council announced the various cases discussed at the board meeting on the 2nd of this month: (1) Announcement of Staff Members of the Publicity Department. A director stated that he had contacted the Daily Newspaper Association regarding the candidates for the Chinese news publicist, and they will be submitted to the Chinese directors soon. Another director stated that the Japanese news publicist candidates are also expected to be launched by the Japanese community soon. (2) Extramural Road Case. The Secretary-General reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government has sent representatives to negotiate this matter with the Bureau, and a preparatory meeting has been held once, and it is expected that consultations will continue soon. (3) Fang Dan Land Micro-Tax Issue. The Chairman proposed to postpone the consideration and discuss it after he and the Secretary-General have consulted. (4) Municipal Funding Allocation Issue. It was decided to ask the Secretary-General and the Director of the Accounting Office to contact and make a proposal, hoping to include a definite number in the 1932 budget, specifically for subsidizing Chinese public welfare organizations. The directors all said that there should be a fixed amount for this type of thing every year, which should be clearly included in the budget. It should not be overspent unless there are special circumstances. (5) Disaster Victim Issue. The Director of the Health Department reported on the plan to prevent the spread of infectious diseases by disaster victims coming to Shanghai, and advocated that the Health Department be allowed to recruit volunteer personnel with nursing experience for temporary use when needed. Subsequently, the Chairman reported on the situation of attending the representative meeting of the local health authorities in this port a few days ago. The association hopes that the shelter will be set up on a small beach in the Pudong area of the Huangpu River, so that it can be isolated from the outside world. For the sake of the health of the residents of the concession, he has agreed to share the construction costs of the shelter after it is approved by the board of directors. The directors decided to notify the relevant authorities that the Bureau would immediately share the expenses after receiving the expenditure report. Regarding the Deputy Chairman's suggestion to establish a deeper traffic isolation zone, the Chairman should ask the initiators of the shelter plan to pay attention to this traffic isolation zone, which should be set up in a place far away from Shanghai, so that disaster victims will not avoid quarantine. Finally, the request of the Western Relief Committee to sell flags to raise donations on the 12th was approved, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

They went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to start working, preparing for various tasks before the factory inspection. Once the Factory Inspection Law is implemented, they will go to the factories in this city that are subject to the Factory Law (factories that use steam power, electric power, water power, and engine-powered machines, and usually employ 30 or more workers) to carry out inspections. In addition, after Mr. Boone of the Diplomatic Division of the International Labor Bureau arrived in Shanghai, he assisted our country's factories in contacting foreign businessmen for inspection, so that Chinese and foreign factories will be inspected equally at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Disturbance in the French Concession Yesterday <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Indecent Assault on Women Leads to a Major Fight</p>
<p>Detained Workers Awaiting Interrogation</p>
<p>At about 11:00 am yesterday, a dispute occurred in Shenyuli, Huacheng Road, French Concession, when workers of the French electricity company indecently assaulted women, causing a major fight between the two sides. At about 5:00 pm, the workers gathered again to seek revenge and gathered in front of the Songshan Road Police Station, demanding the release of the detained workers. As a result, the police could not stop them and fired two shots into the sky to disperse them. Seven arrested workers are still being held at the police station awaiting interrogation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ A'e is Seventeen Years Old</p>
<p>Li Genfa, a native of Ningbo, is 24 years old and has been working in the import department of the Dalai Foreign Company on Guangdong Road in this port. He is extremely loyal. His family is in his hometown. Because he is alone in Shanghai to make a living and lacks care, he brought his sister to Shanghai and rented a room in the four-pavilion room in Shenyuli, No. 4, Lane 45, Huacheng Road, French Concession. His sister's name is A'e, she is seventeen years old, and she has a slightly attractive appearance. However, she is very gentle and assists her brother in cooking and washing all kinds of chores.</p>
<p>▲ Ladder Blocks the Way Home</p>
<p>At about 11:00 am yesterday, the Gao family at No. 5, the left neighbor of Li, installed electricity. The electric company ordered three workers to go to work. At that time, in addition to carrying all the necessary equipment, the workers also carried a long bamboo ladder on their shoulders and placed it in the narrow lane behind No. 5. While they were working, Li's sister A'e happened to return home from buying coal briquettes. When she stepped into the alley, the ladder was blocking the way home.</p>
<p>▲ Workers Make Indecent Jokes</p>
<p>At that time, A'e saw that the ladder was placed across the alley and could not pass, so she negotiated with the workers. Unexpectedly, the workers not only refused, but also made indecent jokes and threw mud on A'e's face. A'e argued with them, and as a result, she was slapped by the workers. A'e was a weak woman and did not dare to resist, so she cried loudly. The neighbors heard the sound and gathered together. Seeing the situation, they all felt injustice and beat the workers without asking the reason.</p>
<p>▲ Li Genfa Was Beaten</p>
<p>At that time, the workers returned to the factory after finishing their work because they were outnumbered. At about 5:00 pm, the beaten workers gathered more than 50 workers and rushed to Huacheng Road. When Li Genfa happened to return home from work, the workers shouted and knocked Li down and beat him. Li's waist was seriously injured, and a raincoat was taken away. At that time, a Western police officer was patrolling and, fearing that it would cause trouble, rushed to the Xiaobeimen Police Station and reported to the Songshan Road Police Station by telephone.</p>
<p>▲ Secretly Following the Workers</p>
<p>After receiving the news, the police station immediately dispatched dozens of reserve teams in cars and rushed to suppress them. When they arrived there, there was no trace of the workers, so they returned to the police station. However, when Li was besieged and beaten, a friend of Li's named Zhuang Zifa happened to witness a worker taking Li's raincoat. Zhuang remained silent and secretly followed the worker, waiting for an opportunity to call the police.</p>
<p>▲ Pointing Out the Attacking Workers</p>
<p>Zhuang followed to the vicinity of the Baxianqiao and saw the worker stepping into the Quan'an Tea House. Zhuang rushed to report to the Songshan Road Police Station. The police chief sent a detective to arrest him. When they arrived at Quan'an, there were Shanghai Municipal Council workers playing mahjong in the building. Zhuang pointed out one of the attacking workers on the spot. The detectives were about to arrest him, but the workers resisted. As a result, Li Hesheng and three others were arrested and taken to the police station together.</p>
<p>▲ Li Genfa Was Beaten Again</p>
<p>Seeing that three people had been arrested, the workers immediately gathered more than a hundred people and went to the Songshan Road Police Station to demand their immediate release. In order to eliminate the trouble, the police station did not pursue the matter deeply and released the three people at any time. Unexpectedly, it happened that while the three people were being released, the beaten Li Genfa was reporting to the police station by car. When the workers saw Li getting off the car, they attacked him again.</p>
<p>▲ Detectives and Police Officers Were Slightly Injured</p>
<p>At that time, the police station also transferred many detectives and police officers to suppress the situation, but the workers were so fierce that they could not be stopped. The detectives and police officers fired two shots into the sky before being forced to retreat. In the chaos at the time, police officers Nos. 675, 340, and 370, as well as Western Detective Chief Barti No. 10, Western Detective No. 61, and a Russian detective were slightly injured. The police chief ordered arrests, and a total of seven people were arrested.</p>
<p>▲ Names of the Seven Arrested</p>
<p>Among the seven arrested, four were workers from the electricity company and three were workers from the Shanghai Municipal Council. The electricity company included Chen A from the Takagi workshop, Zhao Liang from the Fourth Water Department, Yu Jinsheng from the Takagi workshop, and Zhu Along. The Shanghai Municipal Council included Zhao Jinsheng from the Madajian, Chen Baobao, a tile craftsman, and Gao Afu, a blacksmith. They are currently being held at the police station awaiting interrogation by the Second Special Court. The police station has also ordered a large number of detectives and police officers to patrol to prevent further incidents. The tram company immediately entered all vehicles into the factory at 8:10 pm last night.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Fraudulent "Han Disaster Relief for Cantonese People" Group Cheats Money <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Broken up at the Great Eastern Hotel</p>
<p>Donations Don't Match Receipts</p>
<p>Advertisements Placed to Recruit Liaison Officers</p>
<p>Guo Biao's Solemn Statement</p>
<p>This month on the 3rd, this newspaper carried an advertisement for recruiting liaison officers, which roughly stated that they were urgently seeking ten liaison officers who must be eloquent and loyal, with no guarantee required, and a daily salary of two yuan. Those willing to apply should come to Room 123 on the second floor of the Great Eastern Hotel between 7 PM and 10 PM tonight (the 3rd), and would not be accepted after that. However, the advertisement was unsigned. Generally, people who considered themselves qualified to apply,</p>
<p>envied the generous salary and simple procedures, and the fact that no guarantee was required. That evening, many people flocked to Room 123 of the Great Eastern Hotel on Nanjing Road to register. However, they were refused admission by the men and women residing in the room, who said that the positions were already filled. Those who arrived later were rejected, leaving the applicants extremely disappointed. They gathered outside the room, lamenting their bad luck. However, people continued to arrive in a steady stream. By 10 PM,</p>
<p>a crowd of sixty or seventy people had gathered, and there was much discussion. Some said that the advertisement was a fraudulent act, while others said that since the people in the room claimed that the positions were filled, they should announce the names of those hired or introduce them, otherwise it would be difficult to return home. In the midst of the commotion, the matter came to the attention of Chinese Detective Chief Wang Yingjie and Western Detective Chief Kang Ying of the Lao Zha Police Station, who immediately led officers to investigate the truth. When the officers arrived, the people in the room pointed to the crowd of applicants as those who were trying to extort them, while the crowd claimed that the men and women were colluding to cheat. Each side had its own version of events. The officers then began to investigate and saw a yellow sign with black characters hanging outside the room, reading</p>
<p>"Han Disaster Relief for Cantonese People," and a green poster with black characters advertising for donations. Upon searching the room, they found a donation book, two receipt books, a bundle of "Hankou Flood Relief" advertisements, eight silk badges, all stamped with the seal of the "Han Disaster Relief for Cantonese People" group, and one seal, as well as a smoking set. However, the amount of donations recorded in the donation book was 447 yuan, while</p>
<p>the receipts only amounted to 41 yuan, a significant discrepancy. When questioned about their names and their mission in Shanghai, the men and women said that the two men were Zheng Youqing (also known as Zheng Boxun) and Lin Shanbo, and the two women were Zheng Wangshi, about 30 years old, and Tang Jinghua, about 20 years old, all from Guangdong. Due to the severe flooding in Wuhan, the suffering of the people was unprecedented. People from various places who were living in Hankou were heartbroken and had organized groups to raise funds for relief. However, the Cantonese community in Hankou had not yet taken such action. As citizens of the country, they could not stand idly by, so they and ten other comrades formed the "Han Disaster Relief for Cantonese People" group, and sent these four to Shanghai on the 27th of last month to solicit donations. After arriving in Shanghai, Zheng Youqing</p>
<p>went to the Guangzhao Public Association to ask for assistance. He met with the directors Guo Biao and Chen Bingqian, who generously donated 6,000 yuan. The association sent Cheng Bingkui with Zheng Youqing to take the money to Hankou for distribution. Later, Zheng was unable to go due to other matters, so Cheng went alone. This matter was reported in the newspapers at the time. The recruitment of liaison officers was a separate matter, as they wanted to establish a</p>
<p>copper cigarette case manufacturing business and were recruiting liaison officers to sell the cigarette cases, not to solicit donations. However, due to the lack of capital and the undecided factory location, manufacturing had not yet begun. When the officers asked about the location of the donated funds and the discrepancy between the donation book and the receipts, Zheng vehemently denied any wrongdoing, saying that the donations in the book were filled out by himself and were meant to encourage donations, and that the actual amount should be based on the receipts. As for the 41 yuan that was donated, he initially said it was used for travel expenses, but then claimed it was deposited at the Juchang pawnshop at 112 Wusong Road. The officers found their words contradictory and their behavior suspicious, so they first took Zheng Youqing to Guo Biao to inquire whether the Guangzhao Public Association had made a donation. Guo stated that Zheng Youqing was not qualified to solicit donations, and that Shanghai</p>
<p>has formal Cantonese organizations and the Guangzhao Public Association handles public welfare matters; others should not interfere. The officers then took Zheng to the Juchang pawnshop on Wusong Road to inquire, and the owner, Zheng Ayuan, said that although Youqing was his son, he did not engage in proper employment and had left Shanghai for Hankou with his concubine three years ago and had not been heard from since. Although he had returned to Shanghai, he had not entered the family home, and he did not respond when called. In reality,</p>
<p>the relationship between father and son was worse than that of strangers, so how could he have funds deposited in the shop? The officers then realized that Zheng's actions were indeed fraudulent, so they took him back to the hotel and arrested the other man and two women and took them to the police station. Zheng still did not repent and claimed that he had not committed any illegal acts and that the officers should not interfere. However, the officers arrested the four men and women along with the items found, and those who had come to apply dispersed. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu, based on Article 363 of the Criminal Code,</p>
<p>brought charges of fraud. Zhu Xiaoliang, Tian Jiucheng, Lu Peilin, and three other men who had gone to apply also appeared as witnesses. The remaining people who had gone to apply, some lived far away, and some did not want to go to court because they had not lost money, so they were not listed. First, lawyer Qian described the occurrence of the case, arguing that the eight silk badges that were found were enough to prove that the people recruited by the defendants were in fact to be used to obtain donations, and that their claim to be preparing to promote goods in the future was not credible. However, this case still needed investigation, and an extension was requested. Then, the Chinese and Western detective chiefs reported the details of the case. Witness Zhu Xiaoliang, the current principal of Chengcai Primary School on Yanhai Road, Lao Beimen</p>
<p>because his younger cousin wanted to apply after seeing the advertisement, so he went to apply on his behalf. Zhu was eloquent and thoroughly explained the defendants' false names and fraudulent content, and revealed everything. Then Judge Cheng interrogated the four defendants in order. Zheng Youqing claimed to live in Changxingli, Ermatou, Hankou, and was dispatched by the Zhen Tuan to come to Shanghai to solicit donations, and his other words were similar to his previous statements. Lin Shanbo claimed to work as a street vendor at Dexing Hardware Store in Hankou. This time, Zheng invited him to come to Shanghai on August 27 to solicit donations. Zheng Wangshi also claimed that Zheng invited her to come. Although Tang Jinghua was from Guangdong, she spoke with a Tianjin accent.</p>
<p>Her demeanor was especially calm, quite like a scholarly figure. She lived next door to Zheng in Hankou. After arriving in Shanghai, she initially lived at a friend's place. She only moved to Great Eastern on the first of this month. Her mission was also said to be to help solicit donations. Judge Cheng then ordered the defendants to each post a bail of 1,000 yuan and adjourned the hearing for seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Haddon's Estate Issue <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Conflicting Opinions from Haddon's Family</p>
<p>The Will Procedures Are Extremely Complete</p>
<p>There Are No Cousins</p>
<p>The Inheritance Tax Is Still Under Review</p>
<p>After the death of British Jewish tycoon Haddon, his estate was estimated to be between 150 million and 200 million yuan. Recently, his cousin, Yitzhak Abraham Haddon, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit seeking a share of the estate, which has attracted much attention from society. Yesterday, this newspaper's reporter specifically interviewed a confidant of Haddon's wife to inquire about the truth of the matter. According to him, although this matter has been reported in the newspapers, Haddon's wife has not yet received any formal letter from a lawyer, so it is uncertain whether it is true. As for Haddon's brothers, they are almost all dead, and those who remain are only distant relatives. As for the so-called cousin Yitzhak Haddon, I have been close to Haddon for nearly 25 years and know everything, but I have never known such a person. Haddon's illness began in February of last year, and he was bedridden for more than a year. Not once did this so-called cousin come to inquire. The newspaper reported that Haddon had once given a relief sum of 1,000 yuan, but Haddon's lifetime miscellaneous expenses all had ledgers to prove them, but there was absolutely no such payment. The claim is clearly fabricated. As for the marriage contract, Haddon and Mrs. Carling were married in a Jewish synagogue. When they held their golden wedding anniversary four or five years ago, they registered at the British consulate, so there were no problems in terms of law and religious regulations. Secondly, regarding the will issue, Haddon prepared the will in advance when he was seriously ill this spring. At that time, lawyer Gao Yi and Jewish bishop Ellis were present to witness, and Haddon personally signed it. The legal procedures were extremely complete. Haddon's will consisted of only a few words, roughly stating that his property was to be entirely inherited by his wife, Luo Carling, and after his wife's death, it would be given to his adopted children. Moreover, the so-called cousin Yitzhak Haddon has never directly expressed anything to Mrs. Luo. There is no basis in reason or sentiment, so it can only be laughed off.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Haddon's estate consists of land, houses, and other real estate. The inheritance tax is still under review and investigation. Before it is clearly assessed, the estate cannot be used, so the debts and recent donations have all been borrowed from various sources.</p>

<p>Kidnapping for Ransom and Harboring Kidnappers</p>
<p>Liang Chengyu, a Shandong native, 35 years old, formerly served as a second-rank Chinese detective in the Investigation Department of the General Patrol House. He was prosecuted by the patrol house for the armed robbery of Fang Liansheng's morphine worth 50,000 yuan. The preliminary trial acquitted Liang, but after the patrol house's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, presented sufficient reasons, the Higher Second Branch Court of Appeal sentenced him to ten years in prison. Liang was also involved with Lu A'gen and others, who have already been sentenced to death, in the kidnapping of Chen Shifan, the owner of a construction factory, at the entrance of Fuxingyuan Restaurant on Pingwang Street, Fuzhou Road, at 9:35 PM on December 19 of last year, and in the kidnapping of Li Huiqing on Guangxi Road at 1:30 AM on February 8 of this year for a large ransom. Therefore, the General Patrol House transferred Liang to the Hongkou Patrol House, and the investigating detectives Wei Jinfu and Mao Yiwen and others escorted him to the First Special District Court for interrogation. All the details have been reported in this newspaper and have now been concluded and are awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen presided over the sentencing in the Third Criminal Court, sentencing Liang Chengyu to death for jointly kidnapping for ransom, and to death for harboring kidnappers, to be executed.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Yang Conducts On-Site Inspection</p>
<p>Xia's Servant Had Considerable Savings</p>
<p>Ling Xiangxiang, the sedan chair carrier of the renowned doctor Xia Yingtang, was murdered, burned, and his body destroyed. The case was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now reported that the deceased had considerable savings and had never spent his wages for decades. His murder is widely believed to be motivated by financial gain. After Prosecutor Yang of the District Court went to inspect the scene and conducted a lengthy inspection, he ordered the master and his servants to be brought in for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Four Chinese Detectives Detained <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Accused of Intimidation and Extortion</p>
<p>Guo Baolin, a Jiangnan native, badge number 3217 of the Xin Zha Patrol Station; Zhu Yigui, an Anhui native, badge number 1637; Zhan Yande, a Nanjing native, badge number 2869; and Long Ruilin, an Anhui native, badge number 3086, all four Chinese detectives were ordered by their captain at around 6:00 PM on the 1st of this month to cooperate with Western detectives to inspect pedestrians in their respective jurisdictions for dangerous or prohibited items. Upon returning to the patrol station at 8:00 PM after completing their duties, the captain discovered that the four Chinese detectives had engaged in intimidation and extortion while performing their official duties, and immediately ordered them to be detained separately. However, the patrol station stated that the matter was currently under investigation, so the details of the case could not be disclosed at this time. However, according to this reporter's investigation, a pedestrian named Jiang Youming passed by Baker Road and encountered the search team. The Chinese and Western detectives found Jiang suspicious and ordered him to stop for inspection. They found a lottery ticket in his possession. After obtaining evidence of a crime, the Chinese detectives resorted to extortion, ordering Jiang to pay money to be released. However, because Jiang did not have enough money to meet their demands, he was forced to take off his clothes and pawn them at a nearby pawnshop to pay the money before he was released. Afterwards, Jiang reported the incident to the Xin Zha Patrol Station, which led to the detention of the four Chinese detectives. However, whether the above account is factual remains to be determined after the patrol station's investigation is completed. At 9:30 AM yesterday, the patrol station sent the four Chinese detectives to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where patrol station lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the four Chinese detectives were accused of intimidation and extortion while performing their official duties and requested that they be detained for investigation. Guo Baolin hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him in court. After Judge Wu Tingqi questioned the four Chinese detectives about their age and origin, he ordered Guo Baolin and the others to be detained for investigation and adjourned the hearing for seven days.</p>

<p>Prohibiting Docking at Wharf No. 1 of South Shanghai</p>
<p>To Prevent Danger to Passengers and Criminal Activity</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau previously determined that the Lujia Ferry, which used small boats to tow barges, was abnormally crude. The ferry had no wharf on the Puxi side and always approached the Sixteen Pups, untied cables, and parked by sailing around the bow of the Ningshao or Sanbei Company steamer parked on Wharf No. 1 of South Shanghai, to reach the northern end of the wharf. Furthermore, because of the significant difference in height between the wharf and the ferry, the ferry operator had a barge as a walkway, with a gangplank on top, to reach the wharf. All the passengers boarded and disembarked from there, which was not only extremely dangerous, but also caused a lot of obstruction to the loading and unloading of passengers and goods on the steamer because of the large number of people and the frequent traffic. In particular, the mix of people made it easy for criminals to hide, making it extremely difficult to prevent theft. Shipping merchants have repeatedly complained and requested that the ferry be banned. The ferry was banned once in March. Then the ferry operator Gong Jisheng came to the Bureau</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>and stated that the Dongmen Road Municipal Ferry Wharf would be installed soon. In fact, there was no longer any space to dock boats. He asked for a little time to find a suitable wharf to maintain his livelihood. The Bureau thought that the ferry operator's claim was not unreasonable and allowed the ferry operator to wait until the ferry wharf was installed before banning the ferry in order to consider the livelihood of the ferry operator. In July, the Dongmen Road Ferry Wharf was completed. Soon after, the dredging and repair of the floating wharf started. The Bureau immediately notified the ferry operator to stop docking at Wharf No. 1. When the floating wharf was repaired and installed, Gong Jisheng went to the Wharf and Warehouse Management Office of the Municipal Public Works Bureau and requested to continue docking. The office did not allow it. The ferry operator then docked without permission. The office detained the small boat and the ticket seller and sent them to the Water Patrol General Team for punishment, and ordered them to sign a document promising that they would no longer dock at Wharf No. 1 and would be subject to punishment if they violated the document.</p>

<p>Two Boatmen Fell into the River</p>
<p>The kiln cargo boat Wang Youlin was recently hired by the Zhang Yu Ji Construction Factory to load 60,000 bricks and tiles in Jiahu to transport to Shanghai for unloading at Yinxianggang. The Wang boat set off to Shanghai the other day. To make up for time, yesterday at about 3:00 AM, while sailing on the 18-mile-long Nanhuangpu River, it went the wrong way because it was dark, and crashed head-on into the Xing Hehe boat of the Shanghai Yuan Long Company, which was parked on the riverbank and carrying 300 pieces of pine oil. The bow of the Wang boat was knocked off by three or four feet, and three boatmen fell into the water. The side of the Xing boat was also broken, the oil drums were shattered, the oil was poured out, and the tide poured in, causing the boat to sink. Fortunately, it was on the riverbank and the deck was exposed. Of Wang's three crewmen, only one was rescued on the spot. It is assumed that the other two drowned. The losses suffered were great. Xing detained Wang and demanded compensation for the losses. It is said that the oil was worth more than 5,000 taels. The matter is currently being negotiated.</p>

After the mediator resolved the matter, Zhao was ordered to pay fifty yuan. He paid ten yuan at the time, and still owed forty yuan. He agreed to pay the balance on September 4 (yesterday). However, Zhao was penniless and could not borrow any money. Desperate, he hanged himself in his room on the day before (the 3rd) in the afternoon. Yesterday, the second landlord reported the matter to the police station, who ordered Shen Xiaohe, the security guard of the eleventh district, to report to the District Court for an autopsy.</p>

At that time, the fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire, so it did not cause a disaster. However, Bai Zhangshi, a 21-year-old woman with address in the 40 of the said place, was running frantically when she heard the alarm, and accidentally fell from the upper floor to the lower floor and was seriously injured. Before she could be treated, she died. Yesterday, the Second District Police Station ordered Zhang Hongxun, the security guard of the twelfth district, to report for an autopsy. Unexpectedly, Zhang and the family members instead filed a request with the District Court to waive the autopsy. Prosecutor Yang said that there might be other circumstances and that the security guard had been bribed, and rejected the request and ordered them to wait for the autopsy.</p>

<h3 id="e130">The British-Owned Public Bus Company <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Announces the Dismissal of All Ticket Sellers, the Municipal Party Department and Social Bureau Intervene to Mediate</p>
<p>After the British-owned public bus company's ticket sellers went on strike again, the company yesterday announced the complete dismissal of the striking workers and continued to hire new workers. The Municipal Party Department and Social Bureau will discuss methods to mediate. The various situations yesterday are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Traffic Situation Yesterday, the public buses in the Public Concession were still operated by ticket inspectors and newly hired workers serving as ticket sellers, barely operating Route 1 from Jing'an Temple to Laobazi Road, Route 2 from Er Yangjing Bridge to Park Bazi Square, Route 5 from Sanmaoge Bridge to North Railway Station, and Route 9 from Jing'an Temple to Tilanqiao.</p>
<p>The remaining routes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10 were still out of service. The fare for Route 1 was still 20 cents across the board.</p>
<p>▲Request for Mediation Because of the company's tough attitude, the conditions requested by the ticket sellers were rejected. More than 150 ticket sellers have been formally dismissed by the company. Five representatives, including three unemployed workers and two employed workers, were sent to the Water and Electricity Workers' Union on the night before last to request the assistance of the Standing Director of the Union, and to the Municipal Party Department and Social Bureau to request assistance and mediation. It is reported that the Party and government organs will discuss methods to mediate. ▲The company's firmness The Public Bus Company had previously resolved at a board meeting to hire 40 new workers due to the ticket sellers' strike. They have now completed their training and are serving on the buses. Now, because the ticket sellers who had resumed work have gone on strike again, the company announced that it would continue to hire new workers starting yesterday. It is reported that the General Patrol House has hired hundreds of new workers on behalf of the company and sent them to the Connaught Road headquarters for training yesterday. The company plans to gradually restore all bus routes after the new workers have completed their training and are serving on the buses in order to maintain traffic.</p>
<p>▲The labor unrest is prolonged The British-owned public bus company has completely rejected the 11 conditions proposed by the strike committee. In addition to hiring new workers, yesterday it announced that all 110 ticket sellers who had re-strike would be dismissed to prevent future troubles. Therefore, the labor unrest may be difficult to resolve in a short period of time.</p>

<p>May Not Represent Laborers</p>
<p>Various stores, factories, and shop assistants in this city have had trade union organizations as powerful groups representing their respective people. Since the central government explicitly ordered their dissolution, most of these groups have been reorganized into Lianyi Societies, Lianshan Associations, etc. Those that have already been prepared for organization include the Nanhuo (Southern Goods) Industry Employee Lianyi Society and the China Electric Company Employee Lianyi Society. All have been permitted to be established by the Municipal Party Department and should register with the competent authorities according to the regulations before they can be formally established. It is reported that the Social Bureau has examined their nature and found them similar to disguised trade unions, and has specifically sent a letter to the Municipal People's Training Association to explain their nature and stipulate their powers to avoid disputes. Yesterday, a reply was received from the Municipal Party Department, stating that Lianyi Societies, etc., are mutual aid organizations for factory staff or store assistants to connect feelings and increase knowledge. The intention is good and should be protected, but their nature is social groups, not professional groups, and they cannot represent laborers. If they exceed this scope, they should be corrected. The Social Bureau immediately issued an order to the Lianyi Societies, etc., to handle matters in accordance with the regulations for supervising social groups in this city.</p>

<h3 id="e137">County Government Held a Police Affairs Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government convened a police affairs meeting yesterday. The heads of the six Public Security Bureaus, Zhang Xingbang, Zhao Lian, Zhu Xiangcheng, Zhang Zhenyuan, Xiao Jianxun, and Wu Shizhao, as well as Yao Fusheng, the head of the County Government's Public Security Section, and Chief Inspector Xu Yi, attended. The meeting was chaired by Yao Fusheng and recorded by Hu Gongshou. At the beginning of the meeting, the chairman reported that he was convening the meeting today on behalf of the county magistrate and chairman. Recently, according to the report of the chief inspector, the inspection of the on-duty situation of various sub-bureaus in late August was carried out, and each item was instructed to be corrected, and the county magistrate approved each point, and the heads of each sub-bureau were notified to pay attention to compliance. In addition, the bad habits of the police in this county are still few, and it is relatively easy to rectify them. However, the number of illiterate people is relatively large, and training is not without difficulty. Each sub-bureau chief should always find ways to make them learn. The police have heavy responsibilities, and all administrative facilities are closely related to the police. It is hoped that colleagues will rise up and work hard to rectify. There are great hopes for the future of police affairs in this county. Next, Chief Inspector Xu reported that he was reporting the actual situation found during the inspection and never involved emotional factors. Eliminating feelings and striving to thoroughly rectify police administration has always been a cautious plan. It is hoped that the heads of each sub-bureau will pay attention to it. After the report, the Public Security Section proposed various cases: (1) The division of patrol areas. As a result, each sub-bureau divided the patrol areas according to the local terrain and submitted a map with the route drawn by the 15th of this month. On the one hand, the county will investigate the recent census and household registration surveys in Qingxiang and copy the number of households in each township to each sub-bureau for reference. (2) Strictly restrict the case of apprentice police officers graduating from the Changjing supplementary school requesting to be dismissed. As a result, it was passed as is, but the county government should stipulate reward and punishment methods and notify them for compliance. (3) The winter defense should be prepared early. As a result, it was passed as is, but the census cards of the villagers should be recorded and notified to the public offices in each district, and transferred to the township heads to cooperate and handle the implementation of personnel registration. The county government will notify the residents to strictly comply. (4) The technical training of Changjing should be actively carried out. As a result, (A) it will be handled accordingly, (B) the time and curriculum will be listed and submitted to each sub-bureau for review. (5) How to remedy the illiterate Changjing officers? As a result, the county government issued police answers as teaching materials. Zhu, head of the third sub-bureau, proposed an interim proposal regarding how to stipulate the problem of Changjing's guarantor. As a result, (A) the county government supplements the guarantor; (B) the head of each sub-bureau is responsible for obtaining the guarantor for the applicant of each sub-bureau; (C) from today onwards, the old police officers will be jointly guaranteed by five police officers from the same bureau.</p>

<p>Reader's Letter</p>
<p>Letter from Ms. Su Fen</p>
<p>Fen was forced by the environment to drop out of school. She has been out of school for many years and is very sad. Now she wants to go to society to find some jobs to slightly reduce her mental pain. However, because of her shallow knowledge, she doesn't know where to find a job or what kind of job is suitable for her. She is also unfamiliar with the place, so she doesn't dare to move forward. Yesterday, she read the reader's letter column of Shen Bao and was very comforted. Kind gentlemen, what kind of place needs someone like me who has no strength and can only write? What kind of job is suitable for me? I sincerely ask for your guidance.</p>
<p>(Reply) I am sorry you are asking about the direction of finding a job, but you did not explain what you have learned before and to what extent you dropped out of school, nor did you explain your current environment. I am afraid that my reply will not be very pertinent.</p>
<p>It is best to have considerable preparation before finding a job. Looking at the level of writing in your letter, you may be able to handle document copying and letter drafting with some effort. However, the more ordinary your ability is, the more difficult it is to find a job. If you have the opportunity, you should further improve your writing skills, which will naturally be easier to achieve your goal. Formal schooling is certainly not easy, or you may want to consider a kind of tutoring or self-study that does not interfere with family duties. Are there any tutoring schools nearby? Are there any teachers who can guide self-study? Are there any classmates or other friends who can help you guide you and solve this problem? I still hope that you can think about it more on your own. We do not know you in detail and cannot give you a concrete answer. I hope you will forgive me.</p>
<p>However, I have a word to offer you. Those who have the will succeed, especially in youth. The future is full of opportunities. There are more hopes. Since you are determined to serve society, you can find the ideal realm through the possible environment in a roundabout way. It is not a very difficult thing. The most needed are clear and reasonable opinions and the courage to fight peacefully. The most undesirable things are pessimism and recklessness.</p>

<h3 id="e154">The Effect of Supplementary Education is Where? <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>By Jiang Wenyu (3)</p>
<p>If we want to teach this group of lovable young people currently in the workforce, ensuring each can increase their occupational productivity, we should certainly give them the opportunity for supplementary education. Moreover, if we want to teach them to serve faithfully, love their community and country, and aspire to progress, we cannot but rely on supplementary education. Another point is that we truly hope that a majority of young people who graduate from elementary school or junior high school are willing to serve in the workforce. Therefore, there should be extremely perfect and substantial supplementary education institutions, so that they have a place to study and a path to advancement. On one hand, they can study with peace of mind, and on the other hand, they can work hard to pursue learning, so that their skills improve through learning, and their learning advances further due to having a job. We need not criticize China's current education system and methods, but the eight characters "(not very suitable, in urgent need of remedy)" are probably acknowledged by everyone.</p>
<p>First, it can teach the public to not spend a lot of money. To set up a school, in any case, one must build school buildings and purchase teaching equipment. However, wouldn't it be a great pity if a towering and grand school building with splendid and complete teaching equipment is locked up and unused after students finish classes at four o'clock in the afternoon? Now, by borrowing existing schools to implement supplementary education, there is no need for additional equipment. If industrial schools are used for industrial supplementary education, the advantage is even greater. There are four and a half hours from 5:00 PM to 9:30 PM every day. If there are two classes per two hours, two levels can be set up in one classroom. Teachers are certainly very tired if they work all day long, but those with extraordinary energy and enthusiasm for education may be able to concurrently hold this position. The salary of these part-time teachers is naturally lower than that of daytime teachers, so a lot of money is saved. The public spends less money, but education reaches more people. How economical is this? (If worker supplementary schools are established in large factories and are run successfully, the government should provide even more rewards.) Second, it can teach society to increase productivity and enhance national survival. A majority of young people in the workforce can collectively receive occupational training to refine their skills and expand their capabilities. The improvement of individual production skills and the increase in production quantity, when gathered together, will result in the improvement of the entire country's and society's production skills and the increase in production quantity. In this way, can't the difficult problems of national poverty and people's poverty be mostly solved? Not only that, but as mentioned earlier, supplementary education has three major pillars (namely, physical education and military-civilian training, as well as personality and moral cultivation, in addition to vocational training). These are even more important conditions for the expression of national survival and are especially necessary for China, which is accumulating poverty and weakness. If a majority of young people can increase their production capacity through supplementary education, and can also unite as a group, be of one heart and mind, love their country, and strive diligently, the foundation of the country will naturally be extremely consolidated, and the future of the nation will also gain infinite glory.</p>
<p>Third, it can teach a majority of young people who are unable to continue their studies to obtain opportunities for further education. Therefore, they will not suffer from employment but will enjoy it. Young people who enter the workforce often regret not being able to further their studies. This is also a common human sentiment and can be said to be a manifestation of young people's desire for advancement (but a portion of those who are influenced by the corrupting effects of the imperial examination system and regard graduating from university as a mere decoration should certainly be excluded). Now, there is supplementary education to meet their needs. They work during the day and study at night. Credits are divided into multiple levels, progressing step by step. It is not difficult to reach university from middle school. With ten years of hard work and no financial reward, their knowledge and skills can actually be equal to those of high school and vocational school graduates (even if not entirely complete, at least a portion is the same as the result of higher education). In this way, the majority of young people in the workforce can be jubilant and no longer suffer from employment. Not only will they not suffer, but because they can study with peace of mind after employment, avoiding the burden of tuition fees for their parents and enduring hardship, they will realize that their personal future is bright and splendid, or even be overjoyed. In this way, these young people, and even the fathers and brothers of young people, can gradually change their past special psychology (such as the psychology of valuing further education and favoring vanity, the psychology of looking down on occupations and valuing knowledge, and the psychology of doubting current education and disliking current schools). At this time, education that has reached a dead end can gain a great turning point.</p>
<p>The above are all visible and obvious effects. As for the special effectiveness that supplementary education can demonstrate in promoting compulsory education and subsidizing vocational education under China's special social circumstances, there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>The China Vocational Education Society has been researching and implementing supplementary education for many years. Its affiliated institutions include morning schools, evening schools, and correspondence courses. Although it is not possible to achieve the level of (three pillars standing together and five levels fully equipped) at once, the society's colleagues have long harbored the great aspiration to complete supplementary education and develop supplementary education. Recently, the Society's office has newly added a supplementary education department in order to concentrate efforts, unify affairs, experiment with research, and advance on multiple paths. We sincerely hope to earnestly connect and work together with colleagues in the education and vocational fields to jointly plan and advance, so that China's future supplementary education can become an important stronghold in the education field and a good remedy for curing education's illnesses. Because I am a person serving in the Vocational Education Society and have a special interest in supplementary education, I dare to briefly describe my feelings in order to seek correction from colleagues at home and abroad (End)</p>

<h3 id="e155">Jiangsu Education Department Urges Hu Huanyong to Take Office as Principal of Suzhou Middle School <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Middle School of Jiangsu Province was originally formed by the merger of the Second Middle School and the First Normal School. Its foundation is solid and its scale is large. Since Principal Wang Maozu took over, its achievements have been remarkable. Recently, Jiang, the concurrent principal of the Central Political School, cordially invited Wang to be the director of the Education Department of the school. Wang decided to resign from the position of principal of Suzhou Middle School out of a sense of duty. The Jiangsu Education Department repeatedly tried to persuade him to stay to no avail and has approved his resignation. The seat of principal of Suzhou Middle School that he left behind has been submitted to the provincial government for discussion. It was decided at the meeting to appoint Hu Huanyong as the replacement. According to reports, Hu is a graduate of the former National Nanjing Higher Normal School and Southeast University. After leaving school, he served as a history and geography teacher and concurrently as a dean of discipline in the former Jiangsu Eighth Middle School and First Middle School for many years. Later, because he aspired to further his studies, he studied geography and meteorology in France at his own expense. After returning to China, he successively served as a researcher and secretary at the Meteorological Research Institute of the National Central Research Institute, and as an adjunct associate professor at the National Central University. He is currently an associate professor and head of the Geography Department of the College of Science at Central University. His knowledge and experience are both very extensive. However, it is heard that Hu still humbly declines. Yesterday, the Jiangsu Education Department, with the start of the school term approaching, not only telegraphed Hu to take office as soon as possible but also specially dispatched Xiang Shaoxuan.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Meeting of the Poor Education Foundation <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Preparing to Recruit the Second Batch of Scholarship Students</p>
<p>The Poor Education Foundation Committee convened its autumn general meeting at the Bankers' Association the other day, in accordance with its charter. The following committee members attended: Cao Huiqun, Xu Shanxiang, Xu Peizan, Xu Zuohe, Xu Mingcai, Zhang Yiyun, Shen Enfu, Jiang Weiqiao, Song Wusheng, Hu Shuhua, Cheng Yingzhang, and founder Wu Yun. More than ten people were present. Chairman Cao Huiqun first reported that the first recruitment of scholarship students was conducted with the most open attitude and the fairest method, selecting 14 students who have now been sent to National Central University, Chekiang University, and Datong University. In addition to the Foundation covering their tuition, board, and miscellaneous fees, the students' pocket money is also issued by the Foundation, so that each scholarship student can study with peace of mind and not have their efforts distracted by raising funds. Next, Wu Yunchu proposed methods for raising the number of scholarships, explaining that the Foundation's funds are only over ten thousand yuan, which is not a large amount. This time, individual donations of monthly salaries were used to raise 14 scholarships. If no other avenues are found next year, it may be difficult to recruit scholarship students for the second batch. After discussion, the committee members passed the following principles: (1) The Foundation will raise a certain number of scholarships each year to subsidize graduates of junior high school and above who enter universities or vocational schools. (2) Each scholarship will cost 300 yuan per year, and its duration will depend on the major and school designated by the donor. (3) Donors are welcome to recognize one-quarter, one-half, a full scholarship, or multiple scholarships. (4) For those who recognize a full scholarship, the donor's name will be added to the scholarship to increase visual appeal and show that they are not forgotten. Those who recognize a certain number of scholarships or more may, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, apply for commendation. (5) For those who recognize half a scholarship or less, the scholarship will be named after the surnames of the donors, with appropriate consideration. (6) It is preferred that donations be paid in full at once, but they may also be paid annually. It is heard that although about ten scholarships have been recognized, the large number of students taking the exam this year seems to exceed what ten scholarships can accommodate, so they will continue to actively seek recognition of scholarships from those with enthusiasm for education in order to promote poor education.</p>

<p>▲Amendment of the Charter: Proposal by Hemsen, seconded by Blofarth, whether to amend Article 21 of the Charter as follows: (Article 21: Team Transfers - Players may transfer from Team A to Team B, but only once per season. Under very special circumstances, after three months from the start of each league season, transfers may be approved by the Executive Committee of the General Assembly)</p>
<p>▲Other Business: Other miscellaneous matters concerning the General Assembly</p>
<p>Notice of Rule Changes</p>
<p>The Secretary of the General Assembly announced the following changes to the rules of football matches, as notified by the London Football Association:</p>
<p>▲Rule 5 (Original): When the ball goes out of bounds, the opposing team member of the one who caused it to go out of bounds shall throw it in from the line at the point where it went out of bounds. The player throwing the ball must stand with both feet outside the line and facing the field, throwing it with both hands over the head in any direction. A goal scored directly from a throw-in does not count. The thrower may only touch the ball after another thrower touches it. (Correction): After "(throwing it in any direction)," add "(If the above throwing rules are violated, it will be changed to the other party throwing it)." At the end of the rule, add "(If this part of the rule is violated (that is, the ball is touched immediately without touching another player), the other party will be awarded a free kick.)"</p>
<p>▲Rule 11 (Original): A winning goal scored from a corner kick counts. A free kick awarded for a violation of Rule 9, if directly kicked into a winning goal, counts. However, other free kicks are not included in this example. (Correction): (The position of the second half of the sentence is slightly changed and should be translated as) A free kick directly kicked into the goal by such a violation counts as a winning goal for the non-offending team.</p>
<p>▲Definition 4 (Original): Goalkeeper: Walking with the ball for no more than two steps. (Correction): (Two steps) is changed to (Four steps). The above rule changes have been approved by the International Football Council on June 13, 1931.</p>

<h3 id="e170">The Three Classes of People in the World <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>There are three classes of people in the world. The first class follows the brain as the commander; the second class follows the stomach as the commander; the third class follows the reproductive organs as the commander. The natural part that each person follows as the commander is the thermometer of his personality. We should stand under the banner of whichever commander we want to be. I propose this view not with the hope that everyone will become immortals who do not eat the smoke of the world or self-knowledge monastics. Even Kant, who emphasized the life of reason, wanted to find a lover twice. Bo Yi and Shu Qi also had to eat before King Wu attacked Zhou. I am not advocating that the brain should come out to sever the two desires of food and sex, but rather that the brain should come out to take responsibility for command. Generally, people sometimes listen to the brain's command, sometimes listen to the stomach's command, and sometimes listen to the reproductive organs' command. When he is commanded by the stomach and reproductive organs, he becomes dizzy and unable to extricate himself. Some people, all day long, all year round, all their lives, are fighting for food and love, forgetting everything, willingly becoming food-obsessed and love-crazed, and never waking up until they die; such people are the most pitiful. Young friends! Now the brain, stomach, and reproductive organs are all starting to recruit soldiers. Establish your purpose, recognize your banner, and choose your commander to serve!</p>
<h3 id="e171">Electric Eyes at the Entrance of American Theaters <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhiqing</p>
<p>There is a United Artists Theater in Chicago, USA. Recently, a new invention has been installed that can automatically register the number of audience members entering the theater. It is said that the United Artists Theater is the first theater in Chicago to use this new invention. Currently, it is only for testing purposes. If the results are remarkable after testing, then all theaters in the United States will follow suit and compete to install it. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>This new invention is called "electric eyes" by everyone. Its construction principle is to use a kind of light to illuminate the entrance of the theater. However, this light is not visible to the naked eye. Every time a person passes through it, the light will show a wave. The number of audience members can be inferred from the number of waves. Therefore, theaters that want to install this new invention must specially set up gates at their entrances so that the audience can line up in a single file and enter one after another, so that the light waves will not be disturbed. Every time the light passes through a wave, the counter in the theater manager's office automatically counts. The shape of this counter is like the counter on a foreign taxi. The counting ranges from one to nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine, following the arithmetic addition method completely.</p>
<p>Therefore, theater managers, with this new invention, only need to look at the counter at any time to know how many audience members have arrived up to a certain time. If someone is operating several theaters in one place at the same time, they only need to connect their general office to each theater with wires and install separate counters. Then the business status of each theater can be seen at a glance every minute. Expanding on this, if someone is operating several theaters in various places at the same time, they only need to connect to the general office with wires and install separate counters. At any time, they can know the business status of theaters in various places. What could be more beneficial?</p>
<p>However, this electric eye, in addition to being able to immediately report the business status, can also prevent ticket sellers and ticket takers from engaging in fraud. Because from now on, the ticket price and the number of free tickets for each show in the theater must match the number of people reported on the counter. Otherwise, the theater authorities will only question the ticket sellers and ticket takers.</p>
<h3 id="e172">A Word of Advice <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Friendship between people depends on mutual admiration and need. When one side's conditions disappear, the friendship ceases. In discussing friendship, the ancients and moderns alike first mention Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya. It must be understood that Bao Shuya's righteousness was certainly high, but his discernment was even more unattainable. This is because he would not divide gold unless it was with Guan Zhong. If the recipient of the gold was not Guan Zhong, he would not have become Bao Shuya. Today's enthusiasts of socialising only blame others for not being Bao Shuya, but do not blame themselves for not being Guan Zhong. Why not think more deeply about this?</p>
<p>▲The purest form of love should not have conditions, like food. The habit of enjoying scabs is something one might keep for life. People are unlikely to question why one enjoys sweet flag and jujubes. This is how things can remain unchanged over time. Otherwise, even delicacies become tiresome, let alone simple fare. Moreover, once there are conditions, there are comparisons and changes. This is the result of free love, which is why there are so many divorces. However, have the talented scholars and beautiful women of old not been free? Has their love not been without conditions? One must understand that it actually stemmed from a feeling of cherishing talent. Talent is something unchanging and imperishable, unlike money and status, which can be gained, lost, and change. Therefore, the stories of Hong Fu and Zhuo Wenjun have become timeless tales of romance (Dream Butterfly).</p>
<h3 id="e173">Brief Notes on Painting Lessons at the Huifeng Studio <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Meng'an</p>
<p>Kuang Junyou from Lingui is the eldest son of the late Mr. Huifeng. He inherited his family's scholarship and has long been known for his talent. He excelled in his studies from a young age and once sought advice from such elders as Jiang Yingsheng Yun, He Pansou Weipu, and Wu Canlu Junqing. These elders all valued him highly. Having studied diligently, his achievements grew with age. Kuang Junyou was born in Wanxian, Sichuan. Guilin's landscape is the best in the world, and it is also Kuang Junyou's hometown. Endowed with natural beauty, he is uniquely blessed. Moreover, he has seen many genuine works of the ancients and has copied them extensively. He has achieved perfection in both natural talent and academic ability. Therefore, his brushwork is different from that of contemporary historians. Kuang Junyou often creates original drafts for his paintings. He often stretches paper and holds a brush amidst banquets and gatherings, completing them in a moment. His work is lush, vibrant, and vigorous, and his spirit meets with the ancients. If one has not deeply studied the past, how can one speak of this? Recently, during the summer heat, he used painting as a pastime during breaks from his studies. His inspired thoughts flew quickly, resulting in many excellent works. Zhu Zhang Qiangcun, Cheng Zhang Shifa, and many famous figures at sea have seen them and admired them greatly. Many have added poems and inscriptions, making the beautiful paintings and famous calligraphy even more outstanding. Yesterday, I visited his Xiaohuifeng Studio and saw him engaged in the task of mixing lead and grinding powder. As a result, I was able to have a comprehensive view of his works. Besides landscapes, there were also flowers, plants, and Buddhist images. He imitated the ancients and created his own works, each extremely exquisite. Large and small scrolls filled the walls, making one sigh in admiration. This is not out of personal favouritism. Among them, two paintings were particularly outstanding. Kuang Junyou once obtained old paper and cut it into a small scroll, only an inch high and over ten feet long. One was a small album of three-inch squares. Both were landscapes, with thousands of peaks and valleys, and misty waters. They captured the essence of a thousand miles in a small space. Zhang Qiang and others wrote inscriptions for them, knowing that their discerning eyes would not be mistaken. Kuang Junyou paints to relieve the summer heat, mainly for his own enjoyment. Friends who saw it urged him to display it publicly to share it with others. Kuang Junyou, respecting the wishes of the crowd and also wanting to seek corrections from the masters, specially opened an exhibition at the Ningbo Native Place Association for three days. It opens today. Jia Li, Qian Furen, is skilled in cursive script. Her wise younger brother, Xiao Song, is proficient in imitating seals and making inscriptions. The whole family is refined and elegant, carrying on the beauty of their predecessors. We know that the legacy of our teacher will last forever.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Anecdotes of Disaster Relief <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Huai</p>
<p>The children's music composer, Mr. Hu Jingxi, deeply moved by the deaths caused by the floods and realizing the need for publicity to raise funds for disaster relief, has specially composed three "Begging for Relief" songs. The lyrics are as follows: (1) "The wind whistles, the rain is heavy, the river water rises endlessly. The dam has collapsed and cannot be repaired. The embankment has broken and the water flows horizontally. Endless and boundless is the water, with tens of thousands of families grieving to heaven and earth. The wind whistles, the rain is heavy, regretting not being a carp that can swim." (2) "Regret is long, tears are thick, flooding fields and submerging high-rise buildings. People and objects float with the waves. Millions of disaster victims are like prisoners of Chu. Becoming orphans and widows, where to drift? No food and clothing, worry before our eyes. Regret is long, tears are thick, and winter is coming, colder with no fur coat." (3) "Cry sadly, beg bitterly, donate generously to the disaster relief fund. Send clothes and pants, distribute grain and food. Saving lives is more meritorious than building a Buddha temple. How can we bear not to save those in danger? Who will we turn to when we are in danger? Cry sadly, beg bitterly, compatriots quickly raise the relief fund." It is reported that these songs have been widely spread in various schools as teaching materials, and children's saving for snacks will be used to help with disaster relief. This will have a considerable impact. It is hoped that various schools will widely promote it.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Runyu storytelling troupe, it is rumoured that on the 5th of this month, there will be a voluntary storytelling event. The money earned from the storytelling will be used for flood disaster relief. The Shanghai-based members of the Suzhou Guangyu troupe will also hold a similar event. A meeting was held at the Oriental Bookstore on Tibet Road on the morning of the day before yesterday at 11:00 a.m. After discussion, the manager of the bookstore, Chen Yin Chun, agreed to hold a special storytelling event on the 9th and 10th. In the evening, amateur theatrical performances will be added to attract audiences. Tickets will be sold for half a yuan each. The Oriental Bookstore will not deduct any expenses. All miscellaneous backstage expenses will be borne by the members of the troupe. However, after a public vote, it was decided to use the troupe's public funds for this purpose. Furthermore, the original plan was to be realistic and not sell additional tickets. The total ticket price earned from the four sessions day and night on those two days would be handed over to the disaster relief agencies for distribution. However, due to concerns from some people that the appeal might be weak, it was still proposed to print tickets and sell them door-to-door. Although those responsible for selling the tickets were very enthusiastic, the ticket price was one yuan per ticket. It was stated at the time that tickets would be collected on the 9th and the money would be handed over to the disaster relief effort on the evening of the 10th to finalize the matter. If it is possible to completely get rid of the long-standing habit of selling voluntary tickets door-to-door and quickly finalize the matter, it would be a new record in the history of fundraising. However, it is feared that it will be difficult to escape the long-standing habits. However, according to the reports from those responsible for selling the tickets, everyone is very confident. It is believed that it will not repeat the old mistakes.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Editor: I read in the "Free Talk" section of the September 3rd issue that Jiang Dengxuan is the son of Jiang Guiti, and so on. Dengxuan is from Nangong County, Hebei Province, and Guiti is from Bo County, Anhui Province. This is a mistake. Respectfully, September 3rd.</p>
<p>▲Announcement: To Mr. Nuoxia: Received your message. Received your kind couplet. Thank you very much. Respectfully, your younger brother, Juan.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Records of Things Seen and Heard in the Old Capital <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuan</p>
<p>Flowering Cherry</p>
<p>A guest does not like Beijing, saying that the dust in Beijing rises to the sky in spring and summer, choking the mouth and nose. Chewing it makes a sound. How can this be tolerated? I responded that it is indeed true. There are more than one aspects of Beijing's municipal administration that need to be discussed. This is one of them. In the future, if the municipal authorities can open up larger-scale projects, level the roads, and plant more trees, then this problem can be eradicated. Look at the cleanliness of Dongjiaomin Lane, which is free of even a speck of dust. The reason for this can be imagined. Leveling roads requires a lot of money, which may not be possible overnight. As for planting trees, why can't it be done? In ancient times, the palace often planted locust and willow trees. Tang Dynasty poems depict this frequently. The Forbidden City in Beijing still retains the old rules. Today, beside the red walls from Zhonghua Gate to Tiananmen Gate, there are still many ancient locust trees. Their branches twist and turn, and their bark is mottled. Although they are scattered and not in rows, they can still provide beautiful shade. Besides this, there are also many locust and elm trees in front of the residences of princes and nobles. Mounds, altars, temples and shrines have many pine and cypress trees. On the sides of the imperial ditches, willows droop, lush and green, extending for several miles. All of this shows the abundance of trees in the past. During the years of the Republic of China, in the third and fourth years, municipal administration was promoted. Along the east and west Chang'an streets, weeping willows, German locusts and flowering cherries were planted. These two trees are easy to grow. Today, they provide shade during the long summer, complementing the yellow tiles and red walls, creating a beautiful scene. This shows that there were still talents in urban construction at that time. In recent years, every year during the Qingming Festival, countless saplings are purchased and planted in the streets. Since there is no one specifically responsible for irrigating and protecting them, they wither and die in less than ten days. Saplings are planted every year, and every year they end up with no trees. The same mistakes are repeated, and there is never a thorough plan for change. It is truly sad that there is no one in charge of Beijing's municipal authorities. Many of the newly opened roads and prosperous streets in recent years have no trees. Every summer, the scorching sun shines directly on them, causing pedestrians to be scorched from head to toe. Occasionally, one sees one or two young trees only shoulder-high, swaying as if they are about to die, in a very pitiful state. In fact, every year during tree planting, only ten specially assigned police officers need to be dispatched to patrol the entire city and supervise the matter. It is also possible to hold nearby residents responsible, with each household specifically protecting one tree. If it withers, they will be required to compensate. This is a simple task that is easy to accomplish. The fact that one can break a branch for an elder but does not do it is what describes the Beijing municipal authorities. There are many trees suitable for the soil in Beijing, such as the ailanthus and willow, which can grow almost anywhere. Without being cut down, they never die prematurely. Other trees such as mulberry, jujube, locust and elm can be used as offerings and firewood. Citizens regard them as ordinary. They can be widely planted. However, I believe that the tree that best represents Beijing is the flowering cherry, named for its resemblance to a horse's neck ornament. Its color is red above and white below. Its leaves are small and grow in pairs. It blooms during the day. It does not require cultivation. Without waiting ten years, it grows as tall as a building, and its dense shade can block the red dust. Its name and reality both match the description of an auspicious tree. If there were a wise municipal authority, they could spend a month planting this tree throughout the city, and its beautiful shade would last forever, and future generations would sing the praises of Zhaotang. The municipal government decided two years ago to make the chrysanthemum the city flower. However, the chrysanthemum is not unique to Beijing and is also the symbol of the Japanese imperial family, which is a confusing issue. Why not choose the flowering cherry and make it into a design, which would be more elegant and appropriate?</p>

<h3 id="e176">A Husband's Wife (5) <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>Mrs. Li wanted to move Mr. Li with a very gentle and self-sacrificing method. She simply stood at the entrance of the alley to wait for her husband every night, but he remained indifferent and said nothing. One night, the northwest wind was as sharp as a razor, piercing the skin. Mrs. Li, wearing only a not-so-warm camel hair robe, still stood in front of the alley entrance, waiting for her husband. Suddenly, it started to snow. At first, it was just snowflakes, but later it snowed more and more heavily. Her whole body was covered in snow, turning her into a snowman. Her teeth were chattering from the cold. She leaned her body against the wall, hugging herself with her arms crossed. She forgot about sleep, forgot about the cold and pain, and only waited for her husband to come home. She knew the addresses of several of her husband's friends and could go to inquire, but she did not want his friends to know that he had been coming home so late recently, causing even the slightest damage to his reputation.</p>
<p>The gatekeeper was awakened from his sleep by the alarm clock. He hurriedly yawned, took the lock, and prepared to lock the alley gate. He discovered a person by the wall and was very pleased, thinking to exercise his authority. He thought that if it wasn't a petty thief, it was at least a beggar. He had the right to expel them, or scold them a few times, kick them, or arrest this person and send them to the police station. He could get the luck of being rewarded.</p>
<p>"Go away! What are you hiding here for?" The gatekeeper shouted in a rude and majestic Shandong accent, preparing to grab the person with his rough hands, similar to bear's paws.</p>
<p>"It's me, I'm from number eighty-eight." She was so frightened that she almost cried, but she calmed down and said this sentence.</p>
<p>"Oh? Such heavy snow, what are you doing? Go back quickly!" The gatekeeper changed to a gentler tone in disappointment, because he had discovered that the person standing there was not a petty thief or beggar, but Mrs. Li, who gave him a three-yuan tip every festival.</p>
<p>"No, I'm waiting for our husband."</p>
<p>"The wind is blowing so hard, the snow is falling so heavily, Mrs. Li, look! Your whole body is white, you should go back home and wait!"</p>
<p>"No, I'm waiting... for our... husband." She was partly because of the cold, and partly because she was saddened by what the gatekeeper said. She was resentful that her husband was not as good as an unrelated gatekeeper, who even said a word of concern.</p>

<h3 id="e177">No Major Changes in Financial Gold Standard <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲Slight Increase in Momentum: Yesterday, the fourth day, the gold standard showed a slight upward trend, with the situation being peaceful and without any special changes. From morning to night, it only fluctuated by four taels. Looking back, the net increase was two taels. However, the industry's intentions were hesitant, with both long and short positions making no effort. It seemed unmoved by the rise in the silver market. It was believed that the United States continued to sell gold, and with the stock market weak, the gold price opened high. However, there were always many open positions, leading to a downward trend. The exchange rate was stable and firm, so there was hope for an upward trend. However, there were fluctuations of two taels at times. The market was generally flat, fluctuating around seventy-seven taels. The foreign exchange rate remained stable. There was not much trading on the trading floor.</p>
<p>▲Morning Market Fluctuations: The October opening in the early morning rose by three taels to seven hundred and seventy-seven taels and six qian. Although large bars rose by one-sixteenth, and both public and private telegrams reported a rise of one-eighth in silver prices, the local market was still good. In particular, due to the international silver market conference and the United States' failure to formally announce its position, the gold price showed a high trend. The next best was eight taels and two qian, with more buyers. However, those with strong intentions were still actively selling, with Yifeng, Yongyuan, Chun Tong, Taichang, and others selling. The price immediately fell by three taels. When the British gold price was announced, it was fixed at seventy-four shillings and eight pence, and the price did not change. It was then five taels and seven qian. Yiyuansheng and Wupin bought, and then Youli sold to Zhengjin at eleven shillings and eight pence for British gold in November, and then increased to six taels and nine qian.

At this time, the Indian exchange rate was reported to be one anna lower, but the forward rate was one anna higher. Retail investors slightly increased their buying, so the price increased by two taels. At noon, the price was eight taels and one qian. Then, it decreased by one tael. Qianchangxiang and others sold, and the price closed at seven taels and one qian, and then rose again to six taels and a half. The announced price was still eight hundred and ten taels and six qian, with a discount of thirty-five taels to thirty-two taels. The noon closing price was thirty-three and four taels.</p>
<p>▲Afternoon Market Flat: The afternoon market opened at seventy-five taels and eight qian, which was a small opening for goods. Then, the price rose by more than one tael because the Indian exchange rate was one anna lower. At 2:15, the price was seven taels and three qian, and then decreased by six or seven qian. After 2:30, Xiexing, Yongri, Chang, Dadecheng, and Qianchangxiang all dragged in, and the price immediately rose by one tael. At 3:00, the price was seven taels and six qian, and Zhengjin ate British gold at twelve shillings and eight pence. Soon after, retail investors sold, and the price decreased by more than one tael. At 3:30, the price was six taels and two qian. After that, there were slight fluctuations. After 4:00, banks traded British gold at eleven shillings and eight pence, and the gold price was seven taels and two qian.

At 4:30, the closing price was seventy-six taels and nine qian, which was two taels and three qian higher than the day before yesterday. The maximum price for the day was seventy-nine taels, and the minimum price was seventy-four shillings and eight pence, with a fluctuation of four taels and two qian.

<h3 id="e178">Foreign Exchange Rates Slightly Stabilize <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British, American, and Indian silver markets all saw a rebound, and exchange rates fell. However, news of the United States' silver market rescue problem has not been confirmed. The date of the meeting is still being considered, so the Shanghai market has not been greatly affected. The HSBC listing only reduced half a yuan for the French franc, and the French exchange rate also decreased by half a yuan. Hong Kong added zero six two five. There were no other changes. The domestic market seemed to be stable, with only slight fluctuations. The gold market showed a slight increase. As a result, compared to the day before, the British gold rate decreased by zero six two five, the US gold rate decreased by one two five, and the Japanese gold rate increased by two five. Trading among Chinese merchants was still normal. The British gold rate slightly decreased, with a total transaction of over ten thousand pounds. The US dollar was only twenty million. The Japanese dollar was purchased by the Dalianbang for several tens of thousands of dollars, all sold by Japanese commercial banks.</p>

<p>▲Market Overview: In recent days, the trend of silver cents has been stable without major fluctuations. Yesterday, there was a slight increase, exceeding five cents. This is because the market is gradually starting to move, and silver is showing signs of fatigue again, making it difficult to see any hope for a turnaround in demand. As for the auxiliary jiao dollars, the Jiangjiao dollars rose sharply in the past few days, and the Guangdong jiao dollars gradually increased yesterday. The copper coins also experienced a significant shrinking trend yesterday. In terms of its content, the main reason is that there is no main problem.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Security and Bond Prices Continue to Rise Slightly <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The trend fluctuated, with 15.3 million in transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot securities were still low, but the 19th customs duty had a transaction of 1,000 yuan in the morning, and there were no other transactions throughout the day. The futures market continued to be good, with the transaction volume in the forenoon market reaching about 10 million, and 5.4 million in the afternoon market. The daily fluctuations were moderate. The first two sessions in the morning were relatively weak, and the prices recovered slightly. As a result, except for the October issue of the 19th customs duty and the spot prices of the 19th customs duty, which were about one yuan lower than the beginning of the week, the six unified tax and salt tax continued to decrease slightly, and other securities continued to rise by about two to three jiao. It is temporarily unlikely to have a major increase or decrease. The total daily futures trading volume was 15.3 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is showing a very sluggish trend due to weak spot sales and the continued downturn in overseas cotton yarn conditions. The unfavorable environment has led to a lack of buyers, with both bulls and bears adopting a wait-and-see approach, awaiting changes before making a final decision.</p>
<p>▲ People's Standard Drags Downstream People's Standard</p>
<p>The opening of the previous market was extremely dismal, with each month falling by two, four, and five cents. In the afternoon, bulls closed positions, leading to further drops of three, four, and five cents. The total transaction volume was 14,700 bales. A breakdown shows: Fuhua 950 bales, Yiyu 400 bales, Rongxing 850 bales, Taixing 500 bales purchased; Heshen 600 bales, Yichang 950 bales, Yuanfeng 850 bales purchased. The closing prices of the People's Standard are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>January 152.0, 9102,00 February 152.3, 429,950</p>
<p>▲ Slow Spot Yarn Sales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are sluggish. A survey of daily purchases by various groups totaled 650 bales, with fellow traders taking in 20 bales. Market conditions are flat. Customer groups purchased 180 bales from the interior, 35 bales from Guangdong, 65 bales from Jiangxi, 40 bales from Shantou, 200 bales from Hankou, 50 bales from Tianjin, and 55 bales from miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Cotton Market: Initial Rise, Subsequent Fall <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially rose but then fell. The weather is very unfavorable, with persistent rain. Consequently, most cotton merchants are leaning towards a bullish position, with particularly strong buying from the Hankou Huangbang and active purchases from the Huoji bang. This is entirely due to the poor domestic harvest. However, due to the surplus overseas and the weak trend of American cotton, speculators are aggressively selling, and the package volume is increasing. Given the overall situation, there is little prospect for American cotton to rise. However, considering the poor domestic cotton production, a price of around 34 taels for standard cotton may temporarily stabilize. Future movements will still depend on American cotton.</p>
<p>▲ Hankou Standard Fails to Improve</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard opened in the previous market with weak American cotton and poor sentiment. However, due to the unsettled rainy weather in the port, it initially rose by two to three cents. Later, large accounts sold off, causing it to fall back. The result was a rise of 1.5 cents, followed by a drop of one to two cents in the afternoon. The total transaction volume was 55,700 dan. A breakdown shows: Yuda sold 2,400 dan, Yongfeng 900 dan, Yichang 2,800 dan, Jifeng 1,200 dan, Taixing 1,100 dan; Shenchang bought 2,300 dan, Jifeng 1,200 dan, Dafu 1,900 dan, Xinheng 2,900 dan, Yuanda 2,000 dan. The closing prices of the Hankou Standard are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>▲ Spot Transactions of Imported Cotton Continue</p>
<p>Spot transactions of imported cotton continue intermittently. Sources include: 63 bales of Xin Yao cotton, 278 bales of Chen Yao cotton, 36.85 of Lumite cotton, 100 pieces of Shenxin Factory cotton delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>35.75 of Taolila cotton, 2,500 pieces of Shenxin Factory cotton delivered to the factory.</p>

<p>Recently, 107 bales of new cotton from Xihe arrived in Tianjin. Japanese merchants typically purchase them at this time for sample distribution. The cotton is bright in color and quality, as the county experienced a slight drought in early summer, preventing water stains, etc. Buyers offered 35 taels and 5 mace, but no transaction was reached. Negotiations are ongoing.</p>

<p>▲ American Cotton Still Shows No Sign of Recovery</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market awaited the government report, resulting in mixed conditions. It initially strengthened due to short covering but softened due to Wall Street's downturn. Futures fell by three to five pounds, and spot prices fell by five pounds. English cotton futures rose by three to four points, and spot prices rose by seven points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by five points. The Indian cotton market was quiet but firm, with Pingguoer and Omra rising by 1.5 rupees, and Robi Bai Luo Creek rising by 1 rupee.

<h3 id="e186">Grain: River Cargo Affected by Rain <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>▲ Nanshi groups: Sources are still scattered. There is a slight accumulation in the river. Street shops trading is limited due to continuous rain, and the accumulation is gradually thinning. However, only five companies, Tongfengtai, Chengfeng, Jiutai, Yishun, and Hongsheng, are doing business, with approximately 1,000 shi. Tomorrow, Su Tongbang and Xianzi bang will start buying, and prices for these two types of goods will immediately increase by one to two chi. Other goods have not yet opened. Due to the rain yesterday, no river goods were seen.</p>
<p>▲ Xinzha: Lately, there has been too much rain. The sources from the west road groups are less than ten. In the morning opening, Tongxinggong, Wanshengtai, and Dachang three companies' thin rice and Beigeng rice each jumped two to three chi, which is particularly unusual. Dark market price for special goods opened at 18 yuan. Because of the light rain yesterday, all rice shops closed for the day. Goods can be traded once the weather clears.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Taizhou Rice Sales are Brisk, Prices Rise <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market was stagnant as both local and outside customers showed no appetite. Futures prices rebounded slightly by two to three cents. 300 tons of 9-month small Jiaomi opened at 6.5 taels, and 100 tons of 10-month opened at 6.53 taels. The new trading market price was not favorable, and no transactions were made. Taizhou rice arrives daily, and the local market has a strong appetite. Supply cannot meet demand, and prices are rising steadily. Yesterday, another 3,500 bags of Taizhou white rice opened at a high of 13.23 yuan to 13 yuan, and 12.89 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Flour Market Greatly Affected by US Relief Wheat <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened down in both the morning and afternoon, with prices falling sharply across all months. The main driving factor was the official passage of the US relief wheat of 15 million bushels by the Central Political Council. This news was like a bolt from the blue for outsiders, and they were greatly shocked. The bullish sentiment in various months was overwhelmed. Mills did not greatly increase sales, so the market did not see a large drop. However, with this situation, the morale of the people is feared to be difficult to recover temporarily. As a result, the current month fell by 1.75 cents from the previous day, October and November fell by 2 cents, December fell by 2.5 cents, January fell by 2.75 cents, and February fell by 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Wheat Futures Plummet Unceasingly <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market plummeted in both the morning and afternoon. With the US wheat of 15 million bushels officially approved by the government, the food supply in the disaster areas should be maintained with surplus. Moreover, with the mills steadily releasing inventory, the abundance of wheat in the market should be known by all parties. A portion of inland groups, overwhelmed by this impact, could not resist and had to sell to close out positions. The lowest price for the current month fell to 3 taels and 8 mace 6 cents, October to 3 taels and 9 mace 4 cents, November to 3 taels and 9 mace 5 cents, December to 3 taels and 9 mace 9 cents, January to 4 taels and 3 cents, and February to 4 taels and 6 cents, a huge drop of 1 to 1.2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. However, the closing was slightly better, with the current month down 8 cents, November down 9 cents, and December and February down 1 cent each.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Sold Off Actively <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were few reports from the sugar production area, and the market remained stable. Transactions on the guild market were still sparse. Dutch sugar, grade 24 raw white new cargo, was priced at 11 taels and 7 mace 5 cents; grade 20 medium white sugar, 11 taels and 2 mace, old cargo, 11 taels. The trend was fairly flat. Bowl Green sugar, with continued arrivals, saw slightly quieter demand, and the price fell to 8 taels 5 mace 5 cents to 5 cents. The market was generally stable. While Taikoo brand sugar's fixed price has risen by half a jiao, merchants showed little interest. Spot sugar was sluggish due to slow sales in various places, and the market reversed to flat. DY mark was priced at 11 taels 8 mace 2.5 cents to 8 cents; HM mark, 11 taels 4 mace 2.5 cents to 4 cents, slightly lower by 2.5 cents. B mark, 12 taels; CW mark, 11 taels 9 mace; HX mark, 11 taels 7 mace 5 cents, were still able to hold steady. Dutch sugar was actively sold off. Yesterday, Dachang Foreign Firm sold 200 tons of new grade raw white for October and November shipment at a price of 5 Dutch guilders and 7.5 cents. Huaxin Company sold 300 tons of old cargo, bagged white, for September and October shipment at 5 guilders and 7.25 cents. At the same time, Zhenxiang offered 5 guilders and 6.5 cents for old cargo, with strong buying interest, but the results are pending today's reply telegram.</p>

<p>However, exported Shuang Gong factory silk still requires inspection and measurement.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to develop foreign trade and maintain reputation, requires all exported raw silk to undergo inspection and measurement, which is implemented by the Silk Inspection Office of the Commodity Inspection Bureau. It is now known that Shuang Gong native silk used by domestic silk factories has been explicitly exempted from inspection. However, exported Shuang Gong factory silk still requires inspection and measurement. Yesterday, the ministry ordered the Shanghai Silk Factory Association to notify the Shuang Gong silk factories to take note.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port saw continued strong interest from foreign firms in core-picked Zhen Mei from Wuyuan and Tunxi. Firms such as Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Yihuo, Jinlong, and Tongfu were very active. The market situation is becoming more active, and tea prices are rising across the board. Sentiment is extremely strong. According to a telegram from Morocco, the inventory of green tea is gradually dwindling, and the autumn sales season has begun. It is expected that the market will continue to develop.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Remain Clear and Firm <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market continued to be clear. New York's silk market saw prices for Chinese silk not high, English and French needs for yellow and white silk though prices were not high, and price transfer was difficult. Yesterday, Shenyu and other companies took in 20 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and Xinfu took in 20 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk. Xinchang took in 10 bales of white Gan silk, and the prices remained firm.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Pi Tou, Wide/Tight Camel Down Sell Well in a Timely Manner <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Wide and tight camel down have been selling well recently, with continued interest from local customers. Since the domestic factory products have been available, foreign goods have been greatly impacted. Currently, the wide and tight camel down are on the market, and sales are very active. In previous years, imported goods were often sold off early and quickly. Now, they are largely absent. The domestic camel down from our factory, with the oldest and most established brand, Weiyi, is the first inventor. The best quality is Weilin's Tiger pattern. The Tiger pattern stripe camel down sells for 2 taels and 3 mace per yard wholesale, and the plain color is 1 tael and 7 mace and 2.5 cents. Other brands such as Weiyi's Double Deer pattern, Tianxiang's Crane pattern, Xianda's Camel brand, Shengda's Dragon and Phoenix, and Mingfa's Huadong are all sold at 2 taels and 2 mace and 5 cents, including commission, and plain colors at 1 tael and 7 mace, including commission. However, these are all limited to delivery within Shanghai. For customs declaration and transportation to other places, an additional 1 mace of silver per yard is required.</p>

<p>Yesterday, hardware transactions were exceptionally slow due to the impact of the autumn rain. Although traders tried their best to sell, the unfavorable environment meant that actual transactions were insignificant. Fortunately, prices remained firm, providing some consolation. Changes in various markets are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ English Steel Plate: Over 200 Tons Arrive</p>
<p>Although English steel plate transactions have developed slightly recently, it is only for one or two types of patterns. The overall market remains sluggish. However, another 200 tons arrived yesterday, mostly of larger patterns. The small pattern prices therefore have no in or out. The market is currently estimated at 8 taels and 2 mace 5 cents per dan for 2.5%, 6 taels and 5 mace for 7.5%, and only 5 taels and 5 mace for 1%, which is a drop of 1.5 cents from before.

<p>▲ Small-Sized Nails: Condition Deteriorating</p>
<p>Although small-sized nail transactions have been active recently, the eager sources have led to oversupply, undermining confidence and causing prices to decline. The current market is estimated as follows: 13 taels for 3/10ths, 12 taels and 7.5 cents for 4/10ths, 12 taels and 2.5 cents for 5/10ths, and 11 taels and 5 cents for 6/10ths, a drop of 2-3 cents compared to the previous market.</p>
