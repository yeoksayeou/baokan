<h3 id="c14">日軍突然佔據瀋陽 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>天外傳來一聲霹靂。日本對我東北已不宣而戰。昨晨四時許。我瀋陽城已被完全佔領。並及長春安東營口各地。關於日軍暴行之種種電訊。與當前之嚴重情况。已如本報今日所載。有血氣之國民。聽此噩耗。究將如何。究應如何。</p>
<p>日人之侵我東北。自清日戰後。即突破東北之藩籬。日俄戰後。即進而扼東北之生死。積數十年來經濟之侵略與政治之迫害。其勢力已根深蒂固。山河已無形易色。獨是今日之變。日人乘我大災。無暇外顧。幸災樂禍。實施武力侵略。是爲背棄公理。不宣而戰。無故而侵犯隣國疆土。是爲蓄意擾亂和平。乘人之危爲不義。擾亂和平爲黷武。爲違犯國際公法。吾信維護公理與和平之世界列國。於此决義無坐視。</p>
<p>吾人試取最近日本朝野之言論而加以分析如六月十十四日陸軍三長官會議。討論增加駐屯台灣及朝鮮軍隊問題。金谷參謀總長說明增兵理由謂。「現在我國防作戰。以大陸作戰爲基本。是以一朝有事。對滿蒙方面能迅速輸送有力部隊。制敵機先。始能使戰局爲有利之展開。應乘宇垣總督就任伊始。决行增加朝鮮駐軍。最爲得策。」而南陸相亦謂。「將來如有戰事發生。由朝鮮立派有力部隊。進出滿蒙。較由内地派遣。其迅速與作戰效果。不可同日而語。且際此時會。增加朝鮮駐軍。各國所感。亦必與前不同。故將内地一部軍隊。移駐朝鮮。務宜努力從速使其實現。增加駐鮮軍隊。並非以維持朝鮮治安爲目的。乃因國防上所必須之用兵作戰。不得不爲如是之計劃也。」如八月十四日南陸相在師團長會議席次演說。「滿蒙之地。於國防的。政治的。經濟的。與帝國之生存發展。有極密接之關係。乃近時此方面之狀勢。於帝國有極不好之傾向。使人深感事態之重大化。眞所遺憾。蓋所以馴到如此狀勢者。乃由國際政局之變化。與夫長年月宣傳培養之隣邦排外的國權回復思想。並新興經濟力之滿蒙方面發展有其根底之力。决非一時的現象。而不可不認爲永續的現象。當此之時。奉職務者當益固其奉公之誠。於敎育訓練盡其𤍠忱。期於完成本分之準備。無所缺欠。」如政友會森格等視察「鮮滿」歸國報告謂。「蒙滿中日官民之對立形勢。極形嚴重此問題不解决。則難保不再發生第三第三之萬寳山事件。或較重之事件。而其理由不外滿蒙人口因避内亂之難民而激增。中國權力階級之政治自治策。大形變化。而固有之文化傾於頽廢。換言之。目下完全入於模倣時代。即敎育軍事則倣效日本。政治外交則倣效蘇俄。無望解决之交涉案件達三百餘件。無論日本如何協調讓步。中日關係亦難望合理的展開。」綜上述各人言論而分析。則日本此次武力侵犯。實爲有計劃有準備之動作。其調換朝鮮總督及滿鐵正副總裁。增兵朝鮮。改置滿洲常置軍團。以至最近之萬案韓案。接踵發生。有口中村事件增兵我東北一師團。皆爲今日正式犯我之前哨戰至其所以不惜冒天下之大不韙。而决定然作戰者。則不外擁護旣得權益與鞏固國防。所謂擁護旣得權益。本報旣已屢次予以嚴正之辯正矣。至其所謂鞏固國防則極顯明的爲對美國與蘇俄挑戰。蓋英國刻正忙於自謀。無暇及外。法意諸國。亦與日無直接權益之衝突。惟美與蘇俄。爲日所大忌。自美國宣告禁止日本移民入境。日人即憤激萬狀。敵視之言論。朝野沸騰。自美人宣稱「滿洲權益機會均等。」</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>日人更視若眼中釘。至於蘇俄。這處咫尺革命而後。軍力大張。爲目前世界第一陸軍國。漁權之衝突海參威朝鮮銀行之查封。以及蘇俄五年計劃之着着進展。皆使日人如芒在背。旦夕不安。日前内閣田中義一曾有言。「將來欲制支那。必以打倒美國勞力爲先决問題。與夫日俄戰爭之意大同小異。」又曰。「我日本爲欲自保而保他人。（？）必須以鐵與血方能拔除東亞之難局。然欲實行鐵與血主義。而保東三省。則第三國之美國。必起而制我。斯時也。我之對美角逐。勢不容辭。」又曰。「因北滿之富源。我國再與赤俄　度角逐於滿蒙曠野者。實爲國運之發展上勢所難免。」又曰。「將來之日俄日美戰爭。我國非蹂躪滿蒙。必不爲功。且我國欲實行新大陸計不得不破壞滿洲之中立地爲戰塲」就田中之言證之。今日之事。日人之所謂鞏固國防非變相的對美對蘇俄宣戰而何。又如日人有西野雄治者。著「眼前之遠東大戰」一稽更公　指明美國與蘇俄爲其假想敵。則日本此次之武力發動。其目的更不問可知。當全世界共謀縮滅軍備。永固和平之際。而日人竟决然蹂躪我東北。以向美國與蘇俄挑釁。向世界挑戰。我國目前新遭水災。正力謀拯生恤死。固無力以抗强暴之來臨。然而此種横蠻無理。目無世界之暴行。吾人敢聲請爲維護和平與公理正在舉行常會之國際聯盟及世界各國予以有效之裁制。</p>
<p>於此吾人更敢以血涙之言。爲國人告日人此次暴行實爲我國家之生死關頭。東北半壁山河。今已淪入日人鐵騎蹂躪之下。國人愼勿誤認日人之暴行純爲對美國與蘇俄挑戰而忘自身處境之危迫。實則日人所爭者。我東北也。所蹂躪者。我東北也。鐵蹄到處。山河易色。其大陸政策實現之日。即我國家我民族滅亡之時。臺灣朝鮮鑒在前車。「第二期滅亡滿蒙」之計畫。日人籌之熟矣。數十年來經營籌謀。今日乘我危難。决然作戰。其欲實現其所大欲蓋昭然若揭。國難當前。生存所繫。有血氣之國民。應急起共謀所以自救。</p>
<p>吾人認爲國人目前應持之態度。第一爲持以鎭靜。勿輕舉妄動。以一致之團結。謀積極有效之對付。第二爲準備犧牲。國家存亡。民族生死。千鈞諸此時。必人人抱犧牲之决心。作有效之爭持。第三爲一致對外。外患當前内爭亟應泯滅。共赴國難。萬不可再豆箕自煎陷國家與民族於萬刦不復。第四爲不放棄友有之剿匪救災等工作。拯生恤死。一面安内。一面對外。總之大難當頭。徒焦急無益。輕舉妄動尤無益。以鎭靜積極之態度。犧牲决死之精神。共挽危局共抗强暴。國庶有救。「天助自助者。」國人急起努力。</p>

<p>日人今已對我不宣而戰。朝鮮關東州方面日駐軍及平陽日空軍都已緊急動員。我瀋陽已被佔據。事態極爲嚴重。日人計劃實施武力犯我。已匪伊一朝。自增兵朝鮮。更調朝鮮總督·以至最近增兵我東北。其事先之積極準備。顯然可見。其對我實施武力侵略之口號。一爲維護在我東北旣得權益。一爲鞏固國防。所謂鞏固國防。換言之。即對美國與蘇聯變相宣戰。蓋日人早已認美國與蘇聯爲其假想敵。而不久終不免於一戰也。日人旣具此野心。其實力究若何。當爲國人所急欲明晰。茲特將彼國軍備槪况。及其盤據我東北之軍隊。就書報所載。輯錄如下。關於日本海軍空軍及蘇聯美國之軍備。容再續刋。俾國人得以明瞭眞相·并急起自謀緊急之對策。</p>

<p>｜三比一决賽勝汪孫</p>
<p>男子雙打網球决賽、余田光劉鏗以三比一克服汪民親孫成璧、雙方表演、俱少精彩、且錯誤特多、平平而過、裁判員唐仲光、</p>
<p>决賽成績</p>

<p>變化經過</p>

<p>余劉　一　四　六七　九　五一</p>
<p>汪孫　二三　五　八　十十一十二　七</p>
<p>｜第二盤｜</p>

<p>余劉　二三四　七　九十</p>
<p>汪孫　一　五六　八</p>
<p>共六一四</p>
<p>角逐情形</p>
<p>第盤　爭競甚烈、比數接近異常、四四平手、余劉又得一局、成五比四、豈知連失三局、竟以五比七敗、此盤劉鏗錯誤甚多、觸網之球、爲數甚大、而余田光亦不得力、全敗於自殺、汪孫但孫成璧之有力、殺球、則顔頻而來、於是余劉乃先敗、</p>
<p>第二盤　余劉以五比四佔先、汪孫回勝二局、成五比六、余劉亦得兩局、又成七比六、緊要關頭、勝負仍不能决、七比七後余劉奮勇以九比七勝、此盤余田光漸見得力、用力抽擊、孫成璧之殺球、亦時見觸網、</p>
<p>末二盤　余劉爲保持勝利、小心非凡、對方亦欲奪回勝利、於是雙打賽中、忽見余汪在底線長抽、一來一往而劉孫則旁觀、再則余孫長抽、俱不敢近網、不亦罕見、最後再盤余劉漸見振作、而汪民視不善奔走反手來球、又難於應付、孫成璧則不若十二盤之穏健余劉遂以六比二、六比四得勝、</p>

<p>第一盤楊四比二佔先、向回勝二局、成四四平手、楊再得二局勝此盤楊勝來綽有館裕、正反抽俱甚妙、形勢大可得勝、第二盤楊又以四比一佔先、向僅勝第二局一局、向雖戰成三比四、楊又趕上一馬、再勝一局、即得錦標、豈知事反大不然、楊從此一落千丈、旣不善奔走、於是放棄之球極多、而向來勢汹汹球彈楊拍上不能回過者亦多、向連勝四局、大勢從此挽回而青雲直上、第三盤决戰、向連得三盤、繼以四比一佔先、一反第一盤之頽勢、楊弱球及錯誤過多、雖奮力挽救、向卒以六比四勝第三盤、而以二比一得錦標、向之得勝、全在暴力、楊則不經意而失去、兩方球藝尙須深造、變化不多也、</p>

<p>｜結果曁南五比一勝｜</p>
<p>曁南足球、稱雄海上有年、本届上海市足球錦標、該隊早視爲囊中之物、所謂惟一勁敵者、厥爲優游隊、自開賽以來、一幕一幕、但見曁南優游、猶如雙龍入海、萬丈波濤之中、張牙舞爪、努力前程、迫至昨日、時勢成熟、奪珠之時已届、雙方二十二條好漢、列陣於中華棒球塲、在何春輝執行裁判之下、大戰九十分鐘、曁南氣呑山河、如願以償、五對一比、攫得錦標以去、優游始終奮鬥、士氣邀昂、勝敗不計、良可嘉許、</p>

<p>再加油奠定乾坤　下半時起、優游倍受困阨、全軍退守、惟曁南攻擊不得法、無從入手、乃改變策略、側重兩翼、優游分兵防守、中部空虚、符和萱一脚挑中、羅海光平地射入、成四對一、優游前鋒活躍、直撲敵門、守門救之出險、球忽反趨、羅符兩鋒身入無人之境、並駕齊驅、守門膽大心細、球中其身、頓告平安、優游銳氣驟盛、王才高一頂、幾乎破網而入、幸符和萱趕路、反脚救出、最後楊保森犯規出塲、羅海光</p>

<p>社會局勝工務局　三六比六</p>
<p>工務局人材不齊中、有一二員勉强凑數、戰鬥力自然較差、社會局則久練之師沙場經歷亦富、故兩軍相遇、强弱之勢、頗爲懸殊、勝負之數、無待龜卜、然賽員之精神、始終如一、即工務局亦奮鬥到底有足多也、裁判員倪十明、</p>

<p>土地局與公安局皆百戰之師、各具能耐、一朝相土地局與公安局皆百戰之師、各具能耐、一朝相遇、公外賣力、土地前鋒輕捷善馳、於十分鐘時、聯陣圍攻、先開紀錄、移中開始、不旋踵間、又鐵騎四佈、由中鋒射入一球、公安連遭挫折、發僨氣燄頗盛、惜射門欠準、失之毫厘、殊覺可惜、而土地則側襲暗渡、機巧百出、又添三球、以五比一獲勝、社會局與敎育局兩隊、力量不齊、社會中盧濟滄鈕因楚等皆昔日交大中之健將、餘子亦頗强悍、敎局人材雖頗平均、然無出衆之士、故遭敗挫、兩塲裁判員均張龍海、</p>

<p>比賽略評</p>
<p>百米自由式决賽　尹衍鈞與練顯南、互相逐鹿、頗形緊急、至末　時、尹君因已於四百米預賽中游泳多時、頗顯乏力、卒被　君追出、八米之遥、遂列第二、</p>
<p>百米仰泳預賽　共組兩組、兩組中之第一名均係於最後二十米中追過最先之一人、世事之奇、誠可謂無獨有偶、</p>
<p>女子五十米仰泳决賽　僅劉瑪利女士一人、中國女子游泳人才之缺乏、於此可見一斑、</p>
<p>二百米胸泳預賽　共有三組、第一組由中公符開先所得、其游時動作過速、致用力頗巨、而所獲之前進距離反未見遠、故其成績遠不及第二組凌崇舉之速、蓋凌君之動作較慢而力大、實爲各組蛙式游泳中最良之姿勢、第三組交大鍾朗璇第一、鍾君年僅十七、少年英俊、苟能更加練習、日後定能造成一有用之才、有厚望焉、</p>
<p>千五百米自由式預賽　共分兩組、以第一組鄭貴章之成績爲佳、打破上届紀錄、惟較全國紀錄、（二十五分三秒黃茂源保持）相差尙遠、願鄭君努力前進、</p>

<p>昆蟲中活吃丈夫的有螳螂，蜘蛛，蝎子等而以螳螂吃得最殘酷。法國昆蟲學家法勃耳（一八二三年生，一九一五年死）觀察螳螂Mantis之戀愛有如下之叙述：</p>
<p>『試看他們交配。爲了避免羣衆的搗亂，我們呌他們一對一對的分居。每對夫妻各有一個小家庭，没有閑人進來鬧新房。食物也多多的備好，使他們要吃什麽就有什麽吃，不致於有絲毫之饑荒。</p>
<p>「將近八月底了。雄螳螂，苗條的情郎，以爲時機成熟了，便向他的伴侣瞄準。他彎着頭頸，挺出胸膛，小而尖的臉上表現出𤍠烈的情感。他一點也不動的對着他的意中人獃望。伊並不驚動，彷彿是表示一種不在意的樣兒。雄的得到這點默許的暗示，（我實不知其中之奥妙）便走近伊，忽然展開兩翅，渾身都抖了起來，這大槪是求婚吧。他身體雖小，一衝便衝上他的胖老婆的背上，穏穏的抱住。他們籌備了好久纔實行交配，而交配的時間有時竟需五六點鐘之久</p>
<p>「這一對没有動靜的配偶是值得注意的。他們分開一忽兒便再結合，比從前還親密。這位太太所以愛伊的可憐的丈夫，不但是因爲他能使伊的卵巢受精而且是因爲他的肉很合乎伊的味兒。早則當天，遲則明日，他必定要被老婆捉着，照例在頭頸上一口咬下，細細的吃，除兩翅外都被伊吃得精光。</p>

<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>美飛行家林白夫婦。於七月二十八日自美國起程來遠東游歷。至日本瞬將一月。報載十九日即首途飛華。直飛南京。届時首都各界之𤍠烈歡迎。當可予此舉世聞名之飛行家一新印象焉。日前西報曾載有林白夫婦之軼事及有不來滬之傳說。茲節譯如左。</p>
<p>不來上海　上星期三林白致本埠萬賡汽油公司。請爲渠於十四至十九日之間。在天津與南京二處各預備二十加倫汽油。以資應用。並未述及是否來上海。美國駐滬總領事克寗漢氏異之。遂電詢林白。然迄無覆電。不識何故。據本埠與林白相諗之數飛行家云。吾人或有機會一睹林白夫婦之丰采。乃渠爲避免滬人之𤍠烈歡迎與無謂之應酬。或將悄然來滬。故作此玄虚也。</p>
<p>淡泊名利　滬上素諗林白者。謂渠自成名後。即稍變其天性。乃渠每見他人向之作無謂之諂媚者。至友亦畏之若仇敵。雖總統皇帝等亦然。當時傾倒於渠之美女。不可勝數。百萬黃金。埀手可得。然渠棄之如敝屣。不爲稍動。於是名益噪。敬之者益衆。而亦因之益增渠之厭惡心矣。渠以爲最不幸者。乃美國總統及威爾士太子賜渠以勳章祿位。遂迫不得已復駕機飛行中美洲逃之。迨返。外出輒化裝。否則在紐約城中大有行不得哥哥之嘆也。渠嘗戴破帽。覆至眉際。鼻加墨色眼鏡。偕其夫人往戲院中觀劇。然竟爲人所識。觀客咸移其觀劇之視綫。集中夫婦之身。林白大窘。未待閉幕。即踉蹌而遁。</p>
<p>甜蜜時期　林白自横渡大西洋後。備受美法二國人士之𤍠烈歡迎。其中有一女子名愛妮穆羅。尤爲之傾倒。嘗自詡爲未來之林白夫人。林白初無藉藉名。一旦成名後。遂有億兆婦女以其爲崇拜之偶像。渠於一九二九年飛行至墨西哥。遇前任美國駐墨大使穆羅氏之女公子愛妮女士。發生愛情。於五月二十七日在美國紐傑賢州安格蘭塢穆氏别墅結婚。事前爲避免新聞記者起見。異常秘密。無一人知之。受妮女士得償素願。有情人竟成眷屬。閨房之樂當有甚於畫眉也。</p>
<p>小林白生　林白之子已於去年出世。各報館曾互相競爭。以九牛二虎之力獲得小林白之照片。刋於報端。林白對於新聞記者之感情。素不融洽。故毀譽參半。毀之者輒過甚其詞。離事實太遠。然林白亦不思更正之。乃事實究爲事實雖任何惡意的批評。誠不值識者一笑也。</p>

<p>從前對於兩性戀愛主秘密。現在人對於兩性戀愛主公開。秘密與公開。結果造成現代許多失戀的青年男女。</p>
<p>浮蕩青年。視學校如牢獄。浪漫女子視家庭如逆旅。</p>
<p>與妓女謀肉體之愛。彷彿飽飯後運動。其害極烈。</p>
<p>貓犬無靈决難使人類憐愛。女子無貌。何能令男子愛慕。</p>

<p>京滬道上。要人之往來甚頻。每逢星期六。九時三十分之特快車必掛空花車及臥車到京候用。各要人所用花車。類多指定。宋子文氏爲Ｍ二號。蔣主席則爲ＰＣ一０五號。平日任何人不得借用。蔣主席之花車分爲四部。一爲會客室。一爲臥室。一爲浴室。一爲侍從臥室。内置沙發甚多。壁間繪製絶精。繡帘深掩。燈燭輝煌。一等旅舍不啻也。因主席不常來滬。該車幾於終年留站。亦大可惜也。</p>
<p>鐵路同人捐薪助賑辦法。曾誌本刋。茲者因該項辦法與中央所頒布者抵觸。特加修改惟月薪一百元以下之職工。仍應自行分别認捐。由各段段長勸募。一兩日來。爲數已極可觀。蓋雖月獲十餘金之分道夫火夫等。莫不踴躍輸將　最少者一元。多者一二十元不等。亦可謂見義勇爲矣。</p>

<p>— 陳養年</p>
<p>我國此次水災之重爲數百年來所罕見。所謂水災中之麥種問題。已見前報。據美國洛夫博士之意見。美麥不適宜中國風土。誤種美麥。將不堪設想。應速收集現有之麥種云云。吾人在實際上試騐。殊極不然。愚於十年前次滬。曾由故友茅子衡贈與美白麥一斗。愚帶回鎭江江洲。試種結果。至今十餘年。粒圓莖粗。而毫不變種。如在春夏之交。閒步田疇。見夫美種之麥。莖粗穗壯。碧色油然。與華麥瘦矮。逈乎不同。故一望而知爲佳種也。以上試種美麥情形。係躬親實騐。與美國洛夫博士所論。殊有出入。未知該博士果何所據而云然。按美種之麥。適宜於中國土質。無待再論。不過有一點所最宜注意者。厥惟美麥種植時期。務須在霜降以前十日。愈早愈好。翌年芒種。方可刈穫。所謂宜早種而早收。否則必在華麥收後之六七日乃熟。所不及於挿早秧者此也。我國被水災之區甚廣。將來水退以後。麥種一項。所需至巨。在高原先退水之田地。正可試種美麥。就此改良麥種。未始非計。以免年年洋麥進口。漏巵日甚。陷經濟於不可收拾。所望執政巨公。愛國賢豪。對於本文不惜加以研究。實深拜禱。</p>

<p>炒栗</p>
<p>今南方諸都市。每至中秋前後。街頭巷尾。以糖沙炒栗賣之。標日良鄕栗子。南人於北方地名多糢糊。獨良鄕以炒栗。得印人人腦矣。良鄕者。由北平西南出第一縣也。炒栗之埀於吾國史乘者。至今已幾千年。按契丹國志。蕭罕嘉努嘗對遼主言。臣知炒栗。小者熟則大者必生。大者熟則小者必焦。遼以燕爲南京。必遼之君臣習於燕京風俗。故蕭罕嘉努舉以爲喻。期其易曉也。老學庵筆記云。故都李和搊栗名聞四方。他人百計效之。終不可及。其劍南集夜食炒样有感詩注云。漏舍待朝。朝士往往食此。據此則汴京亦有此風。而南渡以後復傳至江表也。然則區區一物。關係千年來世運之升降。文化之遷移。有如是者。秋宵霜冷。青燈之畔。買此物盈握。噉之有味外味。彌足發思古之幽情。其在北都。炒栗而後。繼以白薯。烤白薯外焦内熟。買一枚立街頭食之。可當一餐。煮白薯汁濃作赤色。味尤腴美。無論貧富。皆嗜啖焉。蓋其香味雋厚。富人雖與馬過衢巷。未有不遥聞而動食指也。</p>
<p>貓厄</p>
<p>聞諸貓種以波斯爲上。在吾國則臨清産獅貓。爲昔年貴游所珍視。獅貓之爲狀也。氄毛濃澤。善伺人意。每當冬夜圍爐。得此物蜷伏足畔。勝似摩挲玉肌。北地苦寒。非氄毛不暖。故此種頗宜。其種性遺傳。須兩三代乃一見。不必每胎皆然。即一胎之中。亦止偶一遇也。余家小花貓。第一胎即産一頭。全身雪白。惟半頰與尾黑。旣長於捕鼠。復善於媚人。終日撫摩。絶不煩怒。丙寅初春。病數日不食。送入醫院。莫測所由。意謂不可救矣。蜷伏爐旁。忽自起就食。自此獲慶更生。及己已之春。忽復失踪。蓋近年貓皮之價大昂。每頭值可數元。奸人貪利。乘夜縱毒。誘而斃之也。畜貓之家。日以失踪相聞。久而漸覺。警廳雖亦捕治此輩。然利之所在。誰能禁之。無以名之。名之曰貓厄。人性不仁。殘及無辜。有如是者。烏乎。</p>

<p>他把常在家裏穿的舊長衫脫去，換了西裝，預備出去訪幾個朋友，但是好幾套西裝外衣的脅下都脫綫裂開了，他歎了一口氣，開着抽斗，找尋妻子的針綫，預備自己補綴，却又找尋不到，他已把這時季可以穿的衣服都找出來，堆在床上，却都是有裂縫，他又怨恨着妻子對於丈夫是這樣的不負責任。女僕是鄕下人，她不會縫這個衣服的，他眞没有法子了，但是又不願穿了裂縫的衣服走到外面去，祇能把訪友的計劃作罷了。他並不把翻出來的衣服整理好，預備讓妻子晚上回家瞧見了，也許過意不去地自動的給他修好。他坐在椅上呆呆地嘆息，計劃着如何規勸他妻子。</p>
<p>李夫人忽然正走進來了，伊手裏拿着一張女人的照片，兩隻秀媚的眼睛，紅腫得很大，伊正是很利害的哭過，眼眶裏還含着亮晶晶的涙水。</p>
<p>「陳先生！你瞧！這是一張女人的照片，也就是那夜汽車裏坐着的那個女人」！李夫人氣喘地而帶着悽楚音調，把照片遞給陳先生。</p>
<p>「眞的，是一個女人，你那裏得來的？」陳先生也有些驚奇。</p>
<p>「是他衣袋裏拿到的。我託你探聽着的有些眉目了没有？你應該帮助我啊」。</p>
<p>「我不敢向你說謊話，我眞没有去探聽過」；</p>
<p>「爲什麽不去」？</p>
<p>「我白天没有空功夫，晚上又懶得出去，你還是託我妻子吧，伊近來常和李先生看電影呢」。</p>
<p>「哦。俄是我從小的要好朋友，論理伊應该帮助我，但是我不願意託伊，伊和我太夫近來太接近了，伊决不會去探聽」。</p>
<p>「你不要灰心，你這樣忠實的待他，將來他一定會覺悟；現在你把氣量放寛些，自己少找些煩惱，也就吧了」。</p>
<p>「你今天的氣色不好看，身體不舒服麽？咦！床上堆了這許多衣服是怎麽的」？</p>
<p>「没有什麽，我想換衣服出去，但是臨時又終止了」。</p>
<p>李夫人便一件件的整理，終於被伊發見了裂縫，伊自去取針綫，每件給他修補完竣，又一件件的用衣架掛在櫉裏。</p>

<p>Disregarding International Law, Disrupting Peace in East Asia</p>
<p>Shenyang, Liaoyang, Changchun, Andong, Yingkou, and Other Places Occupied</p>
<p>At 11:00 PM on the 18th, forty Japanese soldiers stationed on the South Manchurian Railway line suddenly demolished the Huanggu Tun-Ning Railway, initiating military action. At 2:00 AM on the 19th, the Japanese Second Division occupied the commercial districts and the city of Shenyang, conducting indiscriminate searches. The provincial government, arsenal, and granary were burned down. Simultaneously, Japanese troops bombarded the Beidaying barracks. Due to strict orders from the border authorities for all troops to remain calm, there were many casualties among soldiers and civilians, especially among the police. The garrison at Beidaying retreated eastward along the Shenhai Railway line but was intercepted by Japanese soldiers en route, resulting in heavy casualties. Beidaying and Northeastern University were completely occupied by Japanese forces, and transportation was completely cut off. Rong Zhen and his family were arrested by Japanese troops, and First Brigade Commander Wang Yizhe died in action. Yingkou was also occupied by Japanese troops at 8:00 AM on the 19th. The stationmaster and police chief were captured. Japanese naval forces landed at Yingkou and planted mines eight miles from the city to prevent passenger trains from advancing. Changchun fell at 10:00 AM on the 19th. Japanese troops provoked incidents everywhere, with extremely brutal burning and looting. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops Provoke Incidents Without Cause <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>They Themselves Blew Up the South Manchurian Railway</p>
<p>Falsely Claiming It Was Done by Our Country</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 10:00 PM on the 18th, the Japanese South Manchurian Railway Garrison provoked incidents without cause, suddenly blowing up a section of the South Manchurian Railway between Shenyang Station and Huanggu Tun Station, initiating military action. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops themselves blew up a section of the South Manchurian Railway line, falsely claiming it was done by our country, using this as a pretext for provocation. The incident occurred without issuing a final ultimatum to us beforehand, clearly violating international law. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Fan Hansheng, Section Chief of the Information Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told someone that the Japanese claim the reason for the conflict is that Chinese troops attempted to sabotage the South Manchurian Railway. From a personal perspective, this claim is absolutely unbelievable. Chinese troops have always been peaceful, and the South Manchurian Railway line is heavily guarded by Japanese troops. It is inconceivable that Chinese troops would attempt to sabotage it without cause. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) News received here indicates that Japanese troops provoked our country at Beidaying at 10:00 PM on the 18th. The First Brigade of the Northeastern Army stationed at the North Gate of Shenyang was acting in legitimate self-defense, preventing soldiers from clashing with Japanese troops. However, Japanese troops were extremely arrogant and fired first at 11:00 PM, shooting at Shenyang, and launching a fierce artillery attack. This was purely a planned and organized action. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chinese sources generally state that the Japanese troops in Manchuria provoked incidents without cause. Although many Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed by gunfire and shelling, Chinese soldiers did not return fire or resist. Chinese authorities had heard two days ago that Manchurian Japanese reservists had received military equipment, and troops have been arriving in Shenyang in a continuous stream in recent days, including several artillery units. This is not permitted by the treaty, proving that the Japanese plan was very meticulous. Furthermore, a few days ago, a Japanese friend of Zhang Xueliang visited him, advising Zhang not to return to Shenyang to avoid danger. The Chinese authorities in Manchuria consider this war to be akin to intimidation and have ordered troops not to fire on or resist Japanese soldiers in the event of an incident. Therefore, when Japanese troops bombarded Beidaying, the commander of the barracks ordered the troops to stack up their weapons and not resist. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Sudden Occupation of Shenyang by Japanese Troops <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>A thunderclap has come from beyond the heavens. Japan has launched an undeclared war against our Northeast. Around 4 AM yesterday, our city of Shenyang was completely occupied, along with Changchun, Andong, Yingkou, and other places. The various telegrams regarding the atrocities of the Japanese troops and the severity of the current situation have been published in today's newspaper. How will the patriotic citizens react upon hearing this tragic news? What should they do?</p>
<p>Japan's encroachment on our Northeast began after the Sino-Japanese War, breaking through the barriers of the Northeast. After the Russo-Japanese War, they further tightened their grip on the life and death of the Northeast. Over the decades, through economic aggression and political persecution, their power has become deeply rooted, and our rivers and mountains have been imperceptibly changing color. However, today's incident is a transformation. Taking advantage of our great disaster and inability to attend to external affairs, the Japanese are gloating and carrying out armed aggression. This is a betrayal of public justice, an undeclared war, and an unprovoked invasion of neighboring countries' territories. This is a deliberate disruption of peace. Taking advantage of others' difficulties is unjust, and disrupting peace is bellicose. It is a violation of international law. We believe that the world powers that uphold justice and peace will not stand idly by in this matter.</p>
<p>Let us examine recent statements from the Japanese government and analyze them. For example, the Army's Three Chiefs Conference on June 14 discussed the issue of increasing troops stationed in Taiwan and Korea. Chief of Staff Kanaya explained the reason for increasing troops, stating, "Our country's defense operations are based on mainland operations. Therefore, in case of an emergency, we can quickly transport powerful troops to Manchuria and Mongolia to seize the initiative and ensure a favorable development of the war situation. It is most advantageous to decide to increase troops stationed in Korea at the beginning of Governor-General Ugaki's term." Minister of the Army Minami also stated, "If a war occurs in the future, sending powerful troops from Korea to Manchuria and Mongolia will be faster and more effective than dispatching them from the mainland. Moreover, the perception of other countries regarding the increase of troops stationed in Korea at this time will be different from before. Therefore, we should strive to relocate some troops from the mainland to Korea as soon as possible. Increasing troops stationed in Korea is not for the purpose of maintaining security in Korea, but for the necessary use of troops and operations in national defense. We must plan accordingly." Furthermore, Minister of the Army Minami stated in a speech at the Division Commanders' Conference on August 14, "The land of Manchuria and Mongolia has an extremely close relationship with the survival and development of the Empire in terms of national defense, politics, and economy. However, the situation in this region has recently taken an extremely unfavorable turn for the Empire, causing deep concern about the seriousness of the situation. This is truly regrettable. The reason for this situation is the change in the international political situation, the long-term propaganda and cultivation of the neighboring countries' exclusionary national sovereignty restoration ideology, and the developing economic power in Manchuria and Mongolia. These are fundamental forces, not temporary phenomena, and must be recognized as permanent. At this time, those who hold office should strengthen their dedication to public service, devote themselves to education and training, and strive to complete their duties without any shortcomings." Moreover, Morikaku and others from the Seiyukai party, in their report upon returning from inspecting "Korea and Manchuria," stated, "The confrontational situation between officials and civilians of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Japan is extremely serious. If this problem is not resolved, it is difficult to guarantee that a third or even more serious Wanbaoshan Incident will not occur. The reasons for this are that the population of Manchuria and Mongolia has surged due to refugees fleeing from internal turmoil, the political autonomy policy of the Chinese ruling class has undergone major changes, and the inherent culture is declining. In other words, we are now fully entering an era of imitation. Education and military affairs are imitating Japan, while politics and diplomacy are imitating Soviet Russia. There are over 300 unresolved negotiation cases. No matter how much Japan coordinates and makes concessions, it is difficult to expect a rational development of Sino-Japanese relations." Analyzing the statements of the above individuals, Japan's armed aggression this time is a planned and prepared action. The replacement of the Governor-General of Korea and the Presidents and Vice-Presidents of the South Manchuria Railway, the increase of troops in Korea, the reorganization of the Manchurian Standing Army, and the recent series of incidents such as the Wan Incident and the Korean Incident, including the Nakamura Incident and the deployment of an additional division to our Northeast, are all pre-war skirmishes leading up to today's formal invasion. As for why they are willing to risk the world's disapproval and decide to wage war, it is nothing more than to protect their vested interests and consolidate their national defense. Regarding the so-called protection of vested interests, this newspaper has already repeatedly refuted them with solemn rebuttals. As for their so-called consolidation of national defense, it is clearly a challenge to the United States and Soviet Russia. England is currently busy with its own affairs and has no time for external matters. France, Italy, and other countries also have no direct conflict of interest with Japan. Only the United States and Soviet Russia are greatly feared by Japan. Since the United States announced the ban on Japanese immigrants, the Japanese have been filled with indignation and hostility. The opinions of the government and the public are boiling. Since the United States declared "equal opportunity of interests in Manchuria,"</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>the Japanese regard it as a thorn in their side. As for Soviet Russia, this nearby country has greatly expanded its military power after the revolution and is currently the world's leading land power. Conflicts over fishing rights, the sealing of the Vladivostok Korean Bank, and the steady progress of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan all make the Japanese feel as if they have thorns on their backs and cannot rest easy day or night. Tanaka Giichi, the former Prime Minister, once said, "To control China in the future, it is necessary to overthrow American labor first, which is roughly the same as the intention of the Russo-Japanese War." He also said, "In order for Japan to protect itself and protect others (?), it must use iron and blood to remove the difficulties in East Asia. However, if we want to implement the iron and blood doctrine and protect the three eastern provinces, the United States, a third country, will inevitably rise up to restrain us. At that time, our rivalry with the United States will be unavoidable." He also said, "Due to the rich resources of North Manchuria, our country and Soviet Russia will inevitably compete again in the wilderness of Manchuria and Mongolia for the development of national fortunes." He also said, "In the future Russo-Japanese and Japanese-American wars, our country will not succeed unless it tramples on Manchuria and Mongolia. Moreover, if our country wants to implement the New Continent Plan, it must destroy the neutral ground of Manchuria as a battlefield." Judging from Tanaka's words, today's events, the so-called consolidation of national defense by the Japanese, is nothing more than a disguised declaration of war against the United States and Soviet Russia. Moreover, a Japanese man named Nishino Yuji, in his book "The Imminent Far East War," publicly pointed out the United States and Soviet Russia as his hypothetical enemies. The purpose of Japan's military action this time is even more obvious. While the world is jointly seeking to reduce armaments and permanently maintain peace, the Japanese have resolutely trampled on our Northeast to provoke the United States and Soviet Russia, challenging the world. Our country has recently suffered a new flood and is striving to rescue the living and care for the dead. We have no power to resist the arrival of violent forces. However, we dare to appeal to the League of Nations and all countries of the world, which are currently holding regular meetings to maintain peace and justice, to impose effective sanctions on this kind of brutal and unreasonable act that disregards the world.</p>
<p>Here, we dare to tell our countrymen in tears of blood that the Japanese atrocities this time are truly a matter of life and death for our country. Half of our northeastern territory has now fallen under the trampling of Japanese cavalry. Our countrymen must not mistakenly believe that the Japanese atrocities are purely a challenge to the United States and Soviet Russia and forget the danger of their own situation. In fact, what the Japanese are fighting for is our Northeast. What they are trampling on is our Northeast. Wherever the iron hooves reach, the rivers and mountains will change color. The day their continental policy is realized will be the day our country and our nation perish. The examples of Taiwan and Korea are before us. The Japanese have been planning the "second phase of exterminating Manchuria and Mongolia" for a long time. After decades of operation and planning, they have resolutely waged war, taking advantage of our crisis. Their desire to realize their great ambitions is obvious. With national disaster at hand and survival at stake, patriotic citizens should rise up and jointly plan how to save ourselves.</p>
<p>We believe that the attitudes that our countrymen should maintain at present are: First, to remain calm and not act rashly, to unite as one, and to seek active and effective countermeasures. Second, to prepare for sacrifice. The survival of the nation and the life and death of the people are at stake at this moment. Everyone must have the determination to sacrifice and make effective resistance. Third, to unite against external enemies. In the face of foreign aggression, internal strife should be eliminated as quickly as possible, and we should jointly face the national crisis. We must not repeat the fratricidal strife and plunge the country and the nation into eternal destruction. Fourth, to not abandon friendly efforts such as suppressing bandits and providing disaster relief, to rescue the living and care for the dead, to maintain internal stability while dealing with external enemies. In short, in the face of great disaster, it is useless to be anxious. Rash actions are even more useless. With a calm and active attitude, a spirit of sacrifice and determination to die, we can jointly turn the tide and resist the violent forces. Then the country may be saved.

<p>Domestic Urgent Telegrams Three</p>
<h3 id="e15">Zhang Xueliang Telegraphs News of the Fall of Shenyang <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Our Troops Offered No Resistance</p>
<p>(Beiping) To the Central Party Headquarters, all Yuan, Departments, Committees, Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters, Provincial and Municipal Governments, Governor-General's Offices, General Headquarters, Army Division Brigade Headquarters: Honored sirs, and to all legal entities and newspaper offices throughout the country: I have just received an extremely urgent, detailed telegram from Vice Commander Zang Shiyi in Shenyang. Japanese soldiers began attacking our troops stationed at Beidaying last night at 10 PM. Our troops adhered to a policy of non-resistance and did not respond at all. The Japanese soldiers then invaded the barracks, set fire to them, and drove our soldiers out of the barracks. At the same time, they used field artillery to bombard Beidaying and the arsenal. The arsenal has suffered no losses so far. The Beidaying mortar depot was bombed, and the mortar factory was also occupied. Casualties among the defending soldiers are still being investigated. Police stations inside and outside the city were all shot at by Japanese soldiers, and police officers were driven out. The radio transmitting station was also invaded. Repeated negotiations with the Japanese consulate resulted in the reply that the actions of the military could not be directly stopped by diplomats. This is clearly evasive. They also said that it was caused by our troops destroying the bridges of the South Manchuria Railway, which is a fabrication. As of 5 AM today, the gunfire had not stopped. The above information has been notified to the consuls of all countries, but they have not expressed any opinion. We are currently advocating adhering to a policy of non-resistance to avoid local devastation. More information will follow in subsequent telegrams, and we have already telegraphed the Nanjing government. Respectfully submitted, Zang Shiyi Rongzhen Kouchao Seal, Seal, etc. Finally, we received a report from the Shenyang radio station that Japanese troops entered the provincial capital at 6:30 AM this morning, occupied various government offices and communication agencies, drove out our police, and cut off our Beining Railway station. Since then, all news has been completely cut off, and the situation is unclear. The Japanese side is claiming that the Japanese troops are pursuing our troops because they attacked the South Manchuria Railway, but in fact, our side did not do this at all. Even when the Japanese troops attacked our Beidaying, we did not resist at all. In addition to telegraphing the National Government, I respectfully report. Zhang Xueliang Kouchao, (Special Telegram from the 19th)</p>

At 5:30 AM on the 19th, a large group of Japanese troops entered the city through the west gate, occupying various government offices. The provincial government had previously protested to the Japanese Consul General, who replied that the actions of the Japanese troops could not be stopped.

Another urgent telegram stated that the Japanese 2nd Division stationed in Liaoyang was also mobilizing towards Shenyang.

<p>(Beiping) The Central Executive Committee issued a circular telegram stating: To all provincial and municipal party headquarters, overseas party headquarters at all levels, and special party headquarters: Japan's plot to occupy our three eastern provinces and further attempt to seize our entire country is not a matter of a single day. For decades, all its policies have been focused on this. All our Chinese people, including women and children, know this, so there is no need to elaborate further. Now, taking advantage of our pressing internal troubles and the sudden occurrence of natural disasters, which have left countless people homeless and dying everywhere, at a time when the entire country is busy rescuing the dying and healing the wounded, they have suddenly dispatched heavy troops to occupy Shenyang, Changchun, Andong, Yingkou and other places. The extent of their barbarity is still unknown. Such barbaric and tyrannical actions are almost unprecedented in world history. At this time, our party comrades must be of one heart and mind, determined to die, to awaken the people of the whole country and strive to save the nation. (1) In addition to the Red Bandits who endanger the survival of the nation, who must be completely eradicated, we must be of one heart and mind, consolidate the foundation of the country, and strengthen the power of the government. (2) All people must be of one heart and mind and strive to work on disaster relief and resisting aggression. (3) Party comrades must abandon all their opinions and create a strong unity to be a model for national unity. Regarding the above three points, party headquarters in various places must unite comrades, awaken the people, and work diligently. Heaven helps those who help themselves. If humanity cannot be destroyed, then justice cannot bear to be extinguished. It can be asserted that the tyrannical Japan will inevitably be sanctioned by the world. The Central Government is making its best efforts with all its strength. The survival of the nation and the success or failure of the people are at this moment.

Now they know. Japan has occupied Shenyang, Kuanchengtzu (the important intersection of the South Manchuria, Central Eastern, and Jichang railway lines), Niuzhuang, and Goubangzi (Beining Railway). It has also sent troops to land in Qingdao. During the Japanese army's extremely well-arranged and well-commanded actions, many Chinese were killed or injured. According to Japanese news, only one Japanese officer was injured and one soldier was killed. According to the Japanese, the most recent cause of this strong action by the Japanese was the incident on Friday night at 10:30 p.m. when Chinese soldiers from Beida Camp blew up a section of the South Manchuria Railway. However, this has not been confirmed by the Chinese side and is difficult to verify, as the section has already been repaired and is operating as usual. At the same time, Beida Camp has been occupied, and several Chinese soldiers were killed or injured in the shelling and later disarmed. Upon investigation, an accessory reason that aided the Japanese action was, of course, the spread of a certain piece of news. It is said that Rong Zhen, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Army, has confirmed that Nakamura and three companions were murdered in Inner Mongolia in June. The Japanese have been deeply stimulated by Nakamura's murder. The Japanese military has not hesitated to distribute pamphlets with inflammatory language by plane to arouse the emotions of the Japanese people. Therefore, the initial report of the Shenyang battle can be said to have originated from the Japanese soldiers venting their anger. This is what Japanese civil officials call beyond their authority. But the real reason is not here. It is heard that there are over 300 unresolved issues between China and Japan. Powerful politicians in Japan have recently held a belief that if they do not adopt harsh measures, China will continue its delaying tactics. Even members of the Minsei Party have differing opinions on whether it is appropriate for Japan to continue its mild policy towards China. Under the guidance of Minister of the Army Minami and other military personnel, Japanese emotions have become increasingly激昂 and the call for war is resounding. Japanese radicals even say that if Russia does not wage war against China, the Moscow conference will not be held and the Sino-Russian issues will not be discussed. Therefore, Japan should emulate and adopt more practical policies. This is the real reason for the Japanese military action. The Chinese side says that the Japanese are actually trying to achieve the goal of annexing Manchuria through this incident. The development of Chinese railways in Manchuria, which run parallel to the South Manchuria Railway, is clearly a great concern to Japan. The Chinese routes have lower taxes and reduced fees, which have the potential to crowd out the South Manchuria Railway and its branches. Furthermore, the discrimination against the Port of Dalian and the increased taxes on Fushun coal have also made the Japanese restless. Therefore, the Japanese are now using extreme methods to show their hand. However, the Chinese have not resisted with force, according to Zhang Xueliang's instructions. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Verbally Acknowledging it as an Unfortunate Incident</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Consulate in Beijing formally notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Japanese government in Tokyo stated that it considers the Japanese military action to be an unfortunate incident and has urgently telegraphed the Japanese military in the Northeast to do its utmost to stop its actions and prevent them from expanding.

<p>(Tokyo) After the Manchurian Incident occurred, stock market prices fell. However, it is heard that the Governor of the Bank of Japan said that this matter will not greatly affect business. Textile manufacturers are concerned about the sluggish sales of cotton goods to China and fear that Japanese-owned textile factories in Shanghai and Qingdao may be forced to shut down as a result. The British Ambassador and diplomatic representatives from several other countries visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to inquire about the details of the Shenyang Incident. The Foreign Minister told reporters that he regretted the occurrence of this incident and explained the necessity of preventing the incident from expanding. In the afternoon, the Minister of the Army told reporters that the situation was gradually calming down and that there was no need to send reinforcements from Korea unless there were unexpected developments. The Army Ministry said that several aircraft have been dispatched from the Pyongyang Air Force to Shenyang to inspect the situation there and maintain communication between the Kwantung and Korean armies. According to the latest news telegrams obtained in Tokyo, the situation is indeed gradually calming down. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After the Shenyang Incident occurred, Minister of the Army Minami immediately held emergency discussions with Chief of the General Staff Kanaya and Director-General of Education Muto to establish countermeasures.

If that is still not enough, it has been decided to send reinforcements from Japan proper. In addition to telegraphing this decision to Commander Hayashi of the Korean Army, he is also estimating the budget and preparing everything. (19th Den Tsushinsha Dispatch)</p>

<p>⊙Andong Colonel Doihara, who had been recalled to Japan by the Japanese government and was currently returning to his post, arrived in Andong today.

If a third country comes out to arbitrate, it should be resolutely rejected. (19th Den Tsushinsha Dispatch)</p>

<p>Lyons Silk Industry Greatly Panicked</p>
<p>London Elementary School Teachers Oppose Salary Cuts</p>
<p>Paris Telegram from the National Assembly on the 18th. France's foreign trade deficit in August was enormous, causing great panic in political circles. In addition, with Britain on the verge of becoming a protectionist tariff country, public sentiment is even more volatile. It is heard that the government will reopen trade agreement negotiations with Soviet Russia in order to remedy the situation. The negotiations have been mostly suspended because Soviet Russia advocated long-term credit. Furthermore, the talks between the heads of government of France and Germany in Berlin in the near future seem to focus on economic issues, with the hope of reaching a close economic understanding between the two countries. Representatives of employers and workers in the Lyons silk industry came to Paris today, expressing concern about the possibility of Britain implementing protectionist taxes, saying that if it becomes a reality, the Lyons silk industry will be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>London Telegram from Reuters on the 18th. Tonight, 10,000 elementary school teachers held a citizens' assembly in Westminster to oppose salary cuts. Richard Lycett, Independent Member of Parliament for London University, said that reducing teachers' salaries is not only unfair, but the position of teachers can only be preserved in theory, not by rioting. Elementary school teachers' salaries must be reduced by 15 percent in accordance with the government's spending cut plan. The day after the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced it, elementary school teachers rallied and marched in London to show their protest. It is now learned that elementary school teachers have spent no less than 10,000 pounds on publicity this week to gain public support for their movement.</p>

Mr. Klegg occupied a key position at the naval conference at the beginning of the year and has now come to Geneva to continue his participation. Mr. Klegg believes that the French memorandum has an unfavorable impact on the British ratio, and Italy also opposes the main part of the memorandum, so he believes that these negotiations are unlikely to have good results.</p>

<p>The Japanese have now launched an undeclared war against us. Japanese troops stationed in Korea and the Kwantung Leased Territory, as well as the Japanese air force in Pyongyang, have been urgently mobilized. Our Shenyang has been occupied. The situation is extremely serious. The Japanese plan to implement armed aggression against us is no longer a matter of a single day. From increasing troops in Korea to transferring the Governor-General of Korea, and up to the recent increase of troops in our Northeast, their prior active preparations are clearly visible. Their slogans for implementing armed aggression against us are, first, to maintain their vested interests in our Northeast, and second, to consolidate national defense. The so-called consolidation of national defense, in other words, is a disguised declaration of war against the United States and the Soviet Union. The Japanese have long regarded the United States and the Soviet Union as their hypothetical enemies, and a war will eventually be unavoidable. Since the Japanese possess such ambitions, what is their actual strength? This is what the people of our country urgently want to understand. Here, we have compiled the following overview of their military preparations and the troops stationed in our Northeast, based on what is recorded in books and newspapers. Information about the Japanese Navy, Air Force, and the military preparations of the Soviet Union and the United States will be published in future installments. This is so that the people of our country can understand the truth and promptly take emergency countermeasures.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Japanese Military Preparations Stationed in Our Northeast <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>After the Russo-Japanese War, the Treaty of Peace of September 1905 (Meiji 38) and the Sino-Japanese Agreement of December of the same year were concluded. Based on the treaty, Japan and Russia each stationed no more than 15 soldiers per kilometer along the Chinese Eastern Railway and South Manchuria Railway lines for defense. Therefore, after the Russo-Japanese War, Japan regularly stationed two field divisions in the Northeast. In 1906 (Showa 39), the Railway Guard Unit was also formed to be responsible for guarding the railway. As a result, the Japanese troops stationed in the Northeast consisted of the division (also known as the Manchuria Garrison Army) and the independent guard unit. In addition, the Japanese troops directly guarding the Kwantung Leased Territory included the Lushun Fortress Headquarters and the heavy artillery battalion, totaling over 13,000 regular troops and over 6,000 guard troops, for a total of about 20,000 personnel.</p>
<p>I. Land Military Preparations</p>
<p>The highest-level organization for the Japanese troops stationed in the Northeast is the Kwantung Army Headquarters. The stationed troops, military organizations, include the Lushun Fortress Headquarters, the stationed division, the independent guard unit, the Lushun heavy artillery unit, and the Kwantung Military Police, army warehouses, garrison hospitals, etc. In addition, the Army Transportation Department has an office in Dalian (surveyed on September 1, 1930).</p>
<p>Kwantung Army Headquarters Initially, the Army Department was established within the Kwantung Government-General. The Governor-General was a general (or lieutenant general), specially appointed, and was the head of civil and military affairs in the Kwantung Leased Territory. In April of the 8th year of the Republic of China (Taisho 8), the government-general system was abolished, and the Kwantung Agency and the Kwantung Army Headquarters were established separately to administer civil and military affairs. The commander of the Kwantung Army was a general (or lieutenant general), specially appointed, directly under the Emperor, commanding the various Japanese Imperial Army units in the Northeast and the Kwantung Leased Territory, and responsible for the defense of the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway lines. The Army Headquarters had departments such as the General Staff, Adjutant's Office, Ordnance Department, Quartermaster Department, Medical Department, Veterinary Department, and Legal Department. The Army Headquarters was located in Lushun, and the commander was General Takashi Hishikari, and the chief of staff was Major General Mitsuharu Miyake.</p>
<p>Stationed Division The division headquarters is located in Liaoyang, and the troops are deployed in Changchun, Gongzhuling, Tieling, Shenyang, Liaoyang, Haicheng, Lushun, and other places. The division commander is Heisaburo Matsui, the commander of the 19th Brigade is Hamasaku Nakamura, and the commander of the 30th Brigade is Kinzaburo Ando. For the convenience of operational tasks and training and education, these units have all become regimental assemblies (i.e., all types of units have become regiments and reside in one place to facilitate training and increase troop strength). Also, the stationed division was originally scheduled to be replaced every two years with a division from mainland Japan. The Military Council meeting on July 1 of this year has already approved the plan for the establishment of a permanently stationed division in Manchuria, as decided by the three chiefs. This plan involves transferring one division from mainland Japan to Manchuria to serve as a permanent stationed division, and abolishing the previous system of exchanging stationed divisions every two years. The implementation of this plan is left to the three chiefs to handle. The 8th Hirosaki Division and the 9th Kanazawa Division are candidates for the transferred division. It is also said that the transportation expenses for the plan to station one division in Manchuria will be covered by the transportation expenses for the division exchange, and the recurring expenses will be covered by the recurring expenses of the stationed division in Manchuria and the division reserve unit. The implementation period is set for April of Showa 8, when the stationed divisions are exchanged. The establishment includes a headquarters for the permanent stationed division, a headquarters for the infantry brigade, and one infantry regiment. Also, there is one infantry brigade headquarters in the Liaoyang area and one infantry regiment, one infantry regiment in the Changchun area, one infantry regiment in Lushun, one cavalry regiment in Shenyang, one field artillery regiment in Gongzhuling, and one engineer battalion in Haicheng. As a result, not only will it not save military expenses, but it will also increase the number of Kwantung troops by 2,000 to 3,000.</p>
<p>Independent Guard Unit In September 1906 (Meiji 39), in order to guard the South Manchuria Railway, participating battalions were established for permanent stationing. Troops were deployed along the railway lines between Pulandian and Changchun, and between Shenyang and Andong, to be responsible for railway security and protecting power lines. In April 1909 (Meiji 42), the Independent Guard Unit was formed, with the headquarters located in Gongzhuling, overseeing the entire guard unit (six battalions). In June of the 5th year of the Republic of China (Taisho 5), the reserve system was abolished and replaced with the active duty system. In March of the 12th year, as a result of military downsizing, two guard battalions were withdrawn. Therefore, the railway guard unit at that time only had four battalions. On April 15 of the 4th year of Showa (1929), the peacetime organization of the army was revised, and two more battalions were added. Therefore, the current Japanese guard unit still consists of six battalions, with the headquarters still in Gongzhuling. The troops are deployed in key areas along the South Manchuria Railway outside the Kwantung Leased Territory, directly responsible for railway security. The commander of the Independent Guard Unit is Lieutenant General Ren Mori. Lushun Fortress Headquarters This fortress commander is subordinate to the Kwantung Army Headquarters and is responsible for the fortress's defense plan, managing the fortress's weapons and materials, and fortress construction and replenishment of military supplies.</p>
<p>Kwantung Military Police The headquarters of this unit is located in Lushun, and the detachments and dispatched teams are located in various places along the railway line (detachments in Lushun, Dalian, Liaoyang, Shenyang, Tieling, Changchun, Andong; dispatched teams in Liutiao Lake, Dashiqiao, Yingkou, Haicheng, Fushun, Kaiyuan, Sipingjie, Gongzhuling, and Lianjiangkou). They are under the command of the Army Commander and perform military police duties. They are also under the command of the Governor of Kwantung and concurrently manage all administrative and judicial police affairs.</p>
<p>Kwantung Army Warehouse Manages the storage, purchase, manufacture, and replenishment of rations, clothing, engineering equipment, sanitary materials, and veterinary materials required by the various units of the Japanese Army stationed in the Northeast. The warehouse was originally located in Lushun, with branch warehouses in Dalian and Tieling. In December of the 10th year of the Republic of China (Taisho 10), the warehouse was moved to Dalian, and a branch warehouse was established in Tieling. Only an office was left in Lushun.</p>
<p>Garrison Hospital Accommodates and treats army patients from various locations, and manages all sanitary materials. Soldiers and their families who fall ill during travel can also be accommodated and treated in this hospital. Hospitals are also located in Liutiao Lake, Dashiqiao, Haicheng, Shenyang, Gongzhuling, Changchun, Andong, and Lianjiangkou.</p>
<p>Garrison Prison A military prison should be established in the place where the military court is located. The Japanese army has a garrison prison in Lushun.</p>
<p>Defense Areas and Troop Strength The troop numbers and locations of the Japanese army stationed in the Northeast: 16th Division Headquarters (Liaoyang), 19th Brigade Headquarters (Tieling), 9th Regiment (Changchun), 19th Regiment (Tieling), 36th Brigade Headquarters (Lushun), 38th Regiment (Shenyang), 53rd Regiment (Lushun), 20th Cavalry Regiment (Gongzhuling), 22nd Artillery Regiment (Haicheng), 16th Engineer Regiment (Liaoyang), 16th Transport Battalion (Liaoyang), Independent Guard Unit Headquarters (Gongzhuling), 1st Battalion (Gongzhuling), 2nd Battalion (Shenyang), 3rd Battalion (Dashiqiao), 4th Battalion (Lianjiangkou), 5th Battalion (Sinuiju), 6th Battalion (Andong). Surveyed in January of the 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Naval Defense Preparations After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan established a naval base in Lushun. On April 1 of the 3rd year of the Republic of China (Taisho 3), the naval base was abolished and replaced with a naval port department. On December 1 of the 11th year of the Republic of China (Taisho 11), the naval port department was withdrawn, leaving only a defense unit. On April 1 of the 14th year of the Republic of China (Taisho 14), the defense unit was also withdrawn. Currently, only naval officers and a radio station are stationed. Because Lushun Port belongs to the defense area of the Second Overseas Fleet, the ships of the Second Overseas Fleet are often anchored in the port.</p>
<p>Within the Kwantung Leased Territory, Japanese residents are subject to conscription. Men between the ages of 18 and 45 are all enlisted in the military. In case of emergency, they can be summoned and formed into an army in an instant, which is very concerning.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Nakamura Case is Urgent for Japan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Liaoning Provincial Government Forms a Third Investigation Team to Investigate Again; Japanese Army Ministry Sends Suzuki to Manchuria to Boost Morale</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Rong Zhen, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Border Defense Commander's Office, who went to Peiping to seek instructions on the Nakamura disappearance case, returned to Shenyang on the 12th. Regarding the negotiation countermeasures, Wan Fulin was ordered by Zhang Xueliang to return to Shenyang and then proceed to Jinzhou to discuss with Zhang Zuoxiang. After a decision is made, it can be handed over to the responsible diplomatic envoy. However, according to information obtained by the diplomatic agencies here, the Japanese side is disregarding diplomatic protocol, abandoning diplomatic agencies, and directly negotiating with Zang Shiyi, the Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government. The Japanese consul in Liaoning, Mr. Hayashi, has repeatedly urged Zang by telephone to reply several times, and threatened that the Japanese army is agitated and fears that a delay in the reply will lead to major changes for which he will not be responsible. Therefore, the next steps are extremely difficult. The second investigation team dispatched by the Provincial Government's Border Defense Commander's Office and the Military Police Headquarters arrived at Wangfu Station on the 7th of this month and is still investigating. There has been no formal report to the province, so the Liaoning Provincial Government is unable to reply to the Japanese side. After Rong Zhen's return, he was again ordered by Zhang Xueliang to form a special senior investigation team, consisting of four staff officers and aides with the rank of major from the Border Defense Commander's Office, along with three company commanders from the Northeast Military Police Headquarters, to conduct a responsible investigation. They are scheduled to depart from Shenyang on the 16th. Although the Northeast authorities are making such efforts to clarify the truth, the Japanese side's pressure is increasing step by step, and it has now revealed its undisguised war preparations. The first battalion of the South Manchuria Railway Guard, led by Colonel Kiyoshi Shirogo, departed from Liaoning on the 9th of this month upon orders, touring the Hachang and Changliao lines of the South Manchuria Railway to comfort the garrison and boost morale, and to convene meetings of veterans to convey the secret orders of the Army Ministry for reporting preparations. The Army Ministry issued a secret telegram on the 8th of this month, ordering veteran groups in various parts of the Northeast to report to three locations: those in southern Manchuria to report to Liaoyang, those north of Liaoyang to report to Changchun, and those in northern Manchuria to report to Harbin. Therefore, retired Japanese soldiers in various places have been very busy these days. The Army Ministry's General Staff Headquarters has also sent General Suzuki to the Northeast to comfort overseas Japanese residents and the army, and to inspect the sites of the Russo-Japanese War. It is reported that he departed on September 12 and should arrive in the Northeast soon. Overseas Japanese residents and the army have been incited by Japanese newspapers in recent months and are already gnashing their teeth at us. After Suzuki's arrival, it will be like injecting another stimulant, leading to a clenched fist and exposed claws. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Japanese Military Demonstration Drill in Changchun <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Territory 80 Li Outside the City Thoroughly Surveyed</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: Since the Wanbaoshan Incident, our country's officials and people have unanimously adhered to justice and actively resisted. The Japanese side, finding itself in the wrong with exhausted arguments, finally withdrew the Japanese police from Mashao Kou. When the Japanese police withdrew, Japanese residents in Changchun, Shenyang, and other places expressed disapproval, claiming it would damage the Empire's prestige and hinder development in Manchuria, as their northward invasion plan could not be realized. Since this plan did not achieve its goal, soon there was the so-called "Nakamura Sergeant Injured and Killed in the Xing'an District" propaganda. Whether this incident actually occurred will only become clear after the Shenyang side investigates. However, the recent words and actions of Japanese residents and the Japanese military in the Northeast suggest a major event is imminent. Leagues, autonomous alliances, and chambers of commerce in various places have all held meetings successively, chanting erroneous ideas such as forcefully confronting China and seizing Manchuria and Mongolia by taking advantage of the situation. Heads of Japanese military agencies stationed in Manchuria, such as Ninomiya, commander of the Kwantung Gendarmerie; Honjo, commander of the Kwantung Army; Mori, commander of the Independent Garrison Unit; and Lieutenant General Domon, all came to Changchun around the 10th of this month to discuss military affairs with Tokugawa Nakazo, commander of the 3rd Brigade stationed in Changchun, and Tashiro Shigetoku, the consul, and to inspect the new barracks built last year and the Japanese military's security situation. As a result, rumors have sprung up, saying that Japan will continue to increase troops to Changchun to guard against northern Manchuria, and that if the Nakamura incident is not satisfactorily resolved by the Japanese side, Japan will send a regiment into the Xing'an District and another two regiments to be stationed in Sipingjie and Changchun to connect with the Japanese troops entering the Xing'an District. This is because they intend to use force to subdue our country and complete Tanaka's plan to send troops into Mongolia. Their ambitions are immense, and our compatriots must not ignore them.</p>
<p>Since the propaganda of the so-called Nakamura Incident, Japanese troops in various parts of the Northeast have been conducting field exercises from time to time. From the 2nd of this month, the 4th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade and the Independent Garrison Unit stationed in Changchun were divided into two groups, and without notifying our local authorities in advance, they conducted a defense and attack drill of Changchun. They designated the areas northwest of the city, including Sanbu Guan, Wulibao, Xinlitun, and the areas southwest of the city, including Huangguagou, Tianjiayoufang, and Chenghoupu, as battlefields. The sound of guns and cannons was loudest on the 11th and 12th, continuing day and night. The villagers were greatly frightened, and their fields and vegetable gardens were trampled and destroyed. The damage to the Wanbaoshan waterway has not yet been compensated, and now the suburbs of the city have been ravaged again. The people of Changchun are truly the fish and meat of the Japanese. According to someone close to the Japanese military brigade headquarters, in the past two years, Japanese troops in Changchun have repeatedly conducted exercises in the countryside, and the terrain 80 li outside the city has been completely surveyed. They are particularly detailed about the areas near Erdaogou, Sandaogou, and the Chinese Eastern Railway in the north. Their ulterior motives are none other than to defend against the northern Manchuria area.</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese military, government, and business people have entered eastern Mongolia and Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces under the guise of travel, numbering in the hundreds each year. They call it travel, but in reality, they are surveying the terrain and investigating resources. Those who enter Mongolia often give gifts to Mongolian youths in an attempt to establish connections. According to an employee of the Sidao Railway, more than a hundred Japanese people who are fluent in Chinese have entered Mongolia via Taonan this spring. They were only seen going north and not seen returning. It is said that most of them have disguised themselves as Chinese people and have been living in Mongolia for a long time, implementing their colonization policy. According to a Mongolian prince from the Gorlos Banner who came to Changchun last month, since this spring, many Japanese people wearing Chinese clothes and speaking Chinese have entered Mongolia. Most of them carry photographic equipment and surveying instruments to investigate and record all the details of the mountains, rivers, and resources. In March, more than ten employees of the Oriental Development Company went to the residence of Prince Qimote of the Zhelimumeng League, expressing their willingness to invest heavily and cooperate with Prince Qi in developing mineral resources and transportation in the Zhelimumeng League and other places. Prince Qi did not agree, and they left. In short, the Japanese have been coveting the land of eastern Mongolia for more than a day. Fortunately, the princes are well aware of the stakes and have not fallen into their trap. (13th)</p>

<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The newly appointed Minister to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, arrived in Shenyang from Peiping at 5:30 a.m. on the 16th. He got off at the Japanese station. Those who came with him included Secretary Ding Shaoji and several others. They stayed at the Lingge Hotel on Sanjing Road. I made a special trip to the hotel to visit. Mr. Jiang said the following, "China and Japan are as interdependent as lips and teeth, and their relationship is close. In recent years, disputes have arisen from time to time, causing various bad impressions. My most important mission in being appointed Minister to Japan this time is to</p>

<p>Strive to help the Japanese government resolve the Wanbaoshan and Korean incidents satisfactorily, thereby strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries. However, since I have been appointed as envoy, I will naturally adopt an open diplomatic approach. As for the rumors about the Nakamura Incident being the beginning of diplomatic negotiations, fundamentally, we are not even at that stage. A detailed investigation is currently underway, and the truth will soon come to light. I (Jiang referring to himself) will stay in Shenyang for about two or three days and then go to Korea. I plan to get off at Pyongyang to pay tribute to the overseas Chinese who died in the Korean incident, and then go to Seoul to convey Chairman Chiang's condolences to the overseas Chinese who were affected. I am also carrying 10,000 Japanese yen to be distributed to the consulate, the overseas Chinese chamber of commerce, and local party branches to comfort the families of the deceased. Then I will go directly to Tokyo to take office. At this critical time in Sino-Japanese relations, I bear this heavy responsibility and can only do my best to overcome difficulties. During my visit to Peiping, I met with Vice Commander Zhang twice. Vice Commander Zhang also has no preconceived notions about Sino-Japanese diplomacy and will handle everything in accordance with the will of the Central Government." At this point, I asked about the successor to our country's Minister to Germany. Jiang replied that he had not heard anything about it. (September 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Recent News on the Jiangbei Dam Construction Project <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Breach in the Shao Dam Is Only Two Feet High</p>
<p>The Yiyu Taiping Dam Was Immediately Blocked After It Collapsed</p>
<p>There Are Rumors That Foreigners Are Contracting the Damming Project</p>
<p>Yangzhou Dispatch: Although the Jiangdu Duan has worked hard to rush the construction at the breach of the Shao Dam, the south entrance of Heiyutang was also completed on the 18th. Including the previous ones, a total of 17 breaches have been blocked. However, according to Dai Xingyi, the representative of the Jiangdu Flood Relief Association, who reported at the disaster relief group's joint office, the height of each blocked breach is only about two feet, only enough to stop the flow. He is worried that a strong west wind will inevitably cause it to collapse. The Central Party Department's Emergency Relief Committee has sent a letter to the Jiangdu Flood Relief Association, entrusting it to send personnel to report the damming work in detail every day. There should be some supervision in the future. There are still 4,224 refugees in the Yangzhou resettlement centers. Jiang Jifu, a member of the Dongtai Chamber of Commerce, sent another thousand refugees on five sailing boats, which arrived here and docked outside the Quekou city at Changsheng Temple, requesting resettlement. As there was no place to settle them, Ruan Lianzhong, the director of the resettlement division, prepared lunch and let them go to other places. In addition to telegraphing the general association, requesting that resettlement centers be set up near the disaster area, the Su Yi Relief Association also consulted with Overseer Zhang and agreed to telegraph the National Government, the Provincial Government, and various Shanghai relief organizations, reporting the situation and requesting financial assistance. As for the water level of the Grand Canal, on the 18th, the Jiangdu Sangu Gate reported 1 zhang and 4 chi and 7 cun. The same was true at the Yangzi Bridge. According to friends from Yizheng who came to Yangzhou on the 17th, the Taiping Dam at the end of the Yiyu dike collapsed by more than 1 zhang at 6 p.m. on the 15th. Fortunately, the salt police and local militia worked hard to rush the dam and completed the work that night, otherwise it would have been a huge disaster.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The authorities have been collecting opinions from various parties and deliberating repeatedly on the Jiangbei military dam breach blocking project, but there are still no concrete measures. Mr. Wang Shuxiang, a member of the post-disaster reconstruction committee, stated to people when he first came to the province that the Jiangbei breach blocking project could follow the example of the Gongjiakou project in Shandong, which may be more effective. If Jiangsu Province feels a lack of talent, it may be possible to borrow talent from Shandong. However, according to widespread rumors, the Jiangbei dam breach project has been agreed upon for a construction price of more than one million yuan, to be contracted by foreign engineers. When asked to the responsible personnel of the province, they claimed that this matter was probably not true, because the statistics and surveying of the blocking work are still in progress, and there is no reason to predetermine a price and contract the whole thing. Recently, someone submitted two suggestions: 1. The use of personnel for the blocking project should combine new and old, and corrupt elements and those without specialized academic knowledge should be excluded. 2. The procedures for contracting and self-construction should be fully prepared. If contracting is not sufficient, self-construction can be prepared to avoid delaying the project. Moreover, the project must be expedited and should not be delayed at all. The provincial authorities have expressed their acceptance because they have insightful opinions.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Jiangbei Water Conservancy Officials Neglect the Investigation of Dikes <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Gao Yihan and Hong Lanyou Return to the Capital to Report</p>
<p>The Supervisory Yuan previously sent supervisory committee members and counselors Gao Yihan and Hong Lanyou to investigate the flood situation in Jiangbei and whether the responsible officials had neglected the dikes. Now Gao and Hong have completed their investigation of the area along the Jiangbei Canal and returned to the capital to report a few days ago. Here is an excerpt from their report:</p>
<p>(Omitted above) I immediately went to the Jiangbei area to investigate. All matters related to the flood situation and relief efforts have already been reported in advance by letter and telegram. Now, the neglect of dikes by officials in charge of water conservancy in the area is presented in detail in the following sections:</p>
<p>(1) Custody and Expenditure of Canal Management Funds: The Canal Management Funds have always been dedicated funds from land taxes and goods taxes. The land tax began in the third year of the Republic of China. Initially, only the eight counties of Huai'an, Yancheng, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixian, Xinghua, and Dongtai were ordered to pay a water conservancy surcharge of two cents per mu. Later, the seventeen counties of Huaiyin, Funing, Lianshui, Siyang, Yizheng, Tongshan, Suqian, Pixian, Suining, Fengxian, Peixian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Haizhou, Shuyang, Guanyun, and Ganyu were also levied a land tax of two cents per mu. From the fifth year of the Republic of China, this land tax was allocated for the management of canals and the Yi River. The annual income was estimated to be about 400,000 yuan, but because the counties retained the funds to develop local water conservancy, very few funds were remitted. After several rectifications, the total income for the entire year of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China was more than 81,000 yuan. From January to September of the twentieth year, the income was more than 110,000 yuan. The goods tax was initiated in the fourth year of the Republic of China, and 20% was levied on the various tax bureaus in Jiangbei. It was originally set for a period of three years, but it was extended again and again, with no end in sight. It was originally expected that this goods tax could generate 340,000 to 350,000 yuan per year, but due to retention and undercollection, the amount of funds collected was very small. The total income for the entire year of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China was more than 113,000 yuan. The total income for the entire year of the nineteenth year was 110,000 yuan. This year, the customs tax was abolished, so the goods tax also ended as a result. In addition, there is a new land tax item, designating the nine counties of Huai'an, Yancheng, Funing, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixian, Dongtai, and Xinghua to add another two cents to the original canal management land tax (the original canal management land tax is hereinafter referred to as the old land tax) as funds for opening the five ports and comprehensively managing the upper and lower reaches. Since the beginning of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, it has been collected by the counties and managed jointly with local gentry. By the sixteenth year, the actual amount collected had reached 600,000 yuan, all of which had been misappropriated by the local governments. From the seventeenth year to August of the twentieth year, the funds remitted by the counties amounted to more than 110,000 yuan. From the seventeenth year, the above-mentioned old land tax and goods tax were remitted to the Jiangsu Bank in Zhenjiang in the name of the Department of Construction, and stored with the seals of the Director of the Department of Construction, the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Director of the Canal Engineering Office, for withdrawal and use. Since March of the twentieth year, the new land tax has also followed the method of the old land tax, with the Department of Construction managing it and the Director of the Department, the Director of the Bureau, and the Director of the Office sealing and withdrawing it. Therefore, during the tenure of Sun Hongzhe as the Director of the Department of Construction, all dedicated canal management funds and port opening funds were managed by the Department of Construction and disbursed by the Water Conservancy Bureau and the Canal Engineering Office of the Department of Construction, while the county governments, county public groups, and people of the tax-paying counties had no right to interfere. According to past practice, the dedicated canal management land tax was used exclusively for canal management. During the era of the Director-General of the Canal Engineering Bureau, all the bureau's routine expenses were allocated by the national treasury and could not be used to transfer dedicated canal management funds. According to Director Sun's statement, the Water Conservancy Bureau's expenses are 10,072 yuan per month, but the Finance Department only issues 8,000 yuan per month, and even delays payments from time to time. The amount of the shortfall and arrears is disbursed from the dedicated canal management funds. This has been the case during the tenure of Wang Boling. From this, it can be seen that the people's attacks on the Director of the Department of Construction are not without reason, because the power of custody and expenditure is concentrated in the hands of the Department, and the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau and the Director of the Engineering Office are subordinates of the Department, so how can they hold different opinions? From this point alone, the Director of the Department has hindered the independence of the dedicated canal management funds and has the suspicion of overspending and abuse. The only reason the Director of the Department canceled the New Land Tax Management Committee was that the committee refused to pay for the survey of Wangjiagang. After changing all the dedicated funds to be managed and disbursed by the Department of Construction, it was as easy as taking something from his own pocket. Therefore, since the Director of the Department took office, in addition to the remaining 114,000 yuan of the new land tax stored in the Communications Bank and the Bank of Communications in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, the remaining 255,000 yuan transferred by the previous Director Wang and the more than 520,000 yuan collected from March of the nineteenth year to September 11 of the twentieth year, totaling a huge sum of 777,700 yuan, has been used to 767,700 yuan. As of September 11, the remaining amount was only 10,136 yuan, 7 jiao, and 6 fen. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Communist Commander Captured and Sent to County for Interrogation: Ding Zhiyan, the captain of the county police team, learned that the Communist fake commander who burned and killed in Zhuangxing had sneaked back to disrupt the area. Yesterday, he led the second squad leader, Yang Xingsheng, in braving the rain to Guo's Temple in the 16th tu of the 8th district, where they captured the bandit leader. He was sent to the county for interrogation yesterday (17th). According to his confession, he is 37 years old, a farmer from this county. After joining the Communist Party in the 16th year, he was assigned as the Zhuangxing burning and killing commander in the winter of the 17th year. Later, due to strict arrests, he went out and joined the command of Taibao Ashu, helping to rob Taojia Village and Jinjia Village, etc. On the one hand, he and Tang Yixin and Li Guanjie, who have already been executed, established an agency in Kangjiaba on the border of Fengnan for secret activities. However, due to lack of funds, he has repeatedly returned to his hometown to rob the homes of Zhang Jiatang Cao Qinghe, Zhang Peisheng, Zhang Caigen, etc., and does not deny sharing the loot. Now County Magistrate Shen believes that the bandit's confession is true. In addition to sending him to the detention center, nailing him in shackles, he also telegraphed the province today for instructions so that he can be executed.</p>

<p>A Shocking Embezzlement of National Taxes Case: Each industry in the county of Kun has to pay national taxes every year. After paying the silver, the collection office first issues a receipt, and a grain certificate is issued in the following year, which is used to re-determine property rights. This has been a long-standing practice. After the National Government issued an order to exempt all national tax debts from the 4th to 14th years of the Republic of China, the collection officer, Hou Yiru, saw that there was an opportunity to commit fraud. He concealed the government order and completely listed all the national taxes paid by each industry over the years as debts to the people, reported them to the province for write-off, and embezzled all the funds (about more than 100,000 yuan), causing each industry to be unable to adjust the string. After Sun Boyuan, an industry member, revealed his inside story, he submitted a petition to the Finance Bureau for a thorough investigation. After Hou learned of this, he tried to find a way out and begged a lawyer to dredge all parties. As a result, he spent 10,000 yuan to settle the matter. This is a major inside story in my Kun, and the authorities are not investigating it thoroughly. It is really shocking.</p>

<p>Shen Longchang Accused of Kidnapping Child: Lu Zhongyu, a police officer from the 7th branch of the Fifth Warehouse, reported that a woman, Zhu Yu's, brought her child, Huixiu, and reported that her husband, Zhu Huogen, was working as a servant at Ye Sidi's house in Wu's Bridge, Fengxian. Her father-in-law, Zhu Jinkui, was cooking at Qiang Jixiang's house in Zhoujiabridge, Caojiadu, Shanghai. On the 12th of this month, she followed her father-in-law to Shanghai to work in a silk factory. Unexpectedly, she had a conversation with a stranger surnamed Lu on the ship. When the ship arrived, Ms. Zhu followed her father-in-law to take a tram with the child. When she got off the tram, the child she was holding was taken away by Mr. Lu. Ms. Zhu immediately chased after him to the South Railway Station and took a bus to Shihudang. She walked to Shen Longchang's house in the 34th tu west of Huangqiao and gave the child to Longchang's wife. She stayed for three nights. At first, she was threatened. Ms. Zhu pretended to agree. After a slight relaxation of precautions, she escaped with the child in the middle of the night on the 15th and requested legal action. After sending a police officer to summon Shen Longchang and his wife, he was not found. According to the situation, the plaintiff was also sent to the General Bureau for verification. After a false budget was passed, it was determined that Shen Longchang dared to take advantage of others' unpreparedness to snatch the child and escape, and also plotted to abduct and sell the child. His lawlessness was extreme. In addition to ordering the police station to strictly limit the time to send the defendant for investigation, the plaintiff and her daughter were first sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Local Gentry Telegraphed for Punishment of Seawall Committee Member: The situation of the seawall in this county is serious. Although funds have been allocated for emergency repairs, it is necessary to learn from the past and prevent future occurrences, and the blame must be assigned. Now, local gentry Geng Daochong, Wu Qianmei, Yang Xuchun, Yu Yunding, Li Zuhua, Wu Qianjun, Zheng Wen, etc., telegraphed to the Provincial Chairman, saying, "Ye Junjian, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, the Jinshan Mouth seawall in Songjiang is about to be in danger. The people of Songjiang are running around in fear and sweat, and telegrams and letters are pouring in. It is heard that Director Xue of the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office, at the meeting of Songjiang County, declined to conduct a site survey on the pretext of going to Shanghai on official business. After the officials and gentry present repeatedly pleaded, he finally agreed to go. The dangerous situation after the survey should be reported to the officialdom. However, the Director is a seawall specialist who has spent huge sums of money over the years with no results. Now that the danger has already appeared, the public is desperate. In addition to receiving funds to purchase materials, the Director has not yet started emergency construction. What is his intention in disregarding the lives of the people? We humbly request that you immediately order the start of construction to prevent the autumn floods. Should the Director be severely punished? We await your decision in fear."</p>

<h3 id="e79">Japanese Army Violently Occupies Shenyang <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Entire Nation Should Quickly Save Itself</p>
<p>Stop Internal Conflicts and Unite Against External Aggression</p>
<p>The aggression and oppression of China by Japanese imperialists have been deeply imprinted in our minds. The negotiations on the recent Wanxian Massacre have not been settled, and the so-called Nakamura Incident was deliberately fabricated and amplified by the Japanese side. Before we knew it, news came that Japanese troops had suddenly and forcibly occupied Shenyang, as well as Changchun and Yingkou. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life in our city were filled with hatred for the enemy and were willing to face the national crisis. The serious expressions of various sectors are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the Public from the Municipal Executive Committee: Dear compatriots, the insidious and vicious nature of Japanese imperialists will alarm and enrage anyone who can recall the various past tragedies of our country. The blood from the recent Wanbaoshan Incident and the massacre of Chinese in Korea has not yet dried, and the negotiations have not yet been completed. Today, the Japanese army is using the so-called "Nakamura Incident" to occupy Shenyang and Changchun by force. Alas, if this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Our people will die without a burial place. According to the Japanese side's propaganda, a Japanese army infantry captain named Nakamura was inspecting the interior of the three northeastern provinces when he suddenly disappeared near the Xing'an district. The Japanese then accused our country's garrison troops of killing him, fabricating a brutal murder and spreading propaganda. As a result, Japanese soldiers loudly advocated a hard-line policy towards China, demanding a military solution to all problems in Manchuria and Mongolia. The opposition Seiyukai Party even made a great fanfare, holding joint meetings and special committees, with the ambition to dominate Manchuria and Mongolia and dominate East Asia. Japanese newspapers in Shanghai and Japanese adventurers in the Northeast did their best to fabricate evidence and bribe witnesses in order to make a mountain out of a molehill and achieve their goal of sending troops to conquer our Northeast. We initially thought that this was just propaganda from a small group of Japanese adventurers and that the reality would not be so unfortunate. However, news came that the Japanese army had actually occupied our Shenyang. According to a telegram from Shenyang yesterday, Japanese troops occupied Shenyang with force at 1:00 AM (September 18th). Chinese officers and soldiers withdrew without resistance, but the arsenal was still under siege. Telegrams and trains only went as far as Huanggu Tun. This telegram has now been confirmed by all parties to be accurate. Our Shenyang is already in the hands of the Japanese, and our compatriots are being slaughtered by the Japanese. Alas, the country is about to be destroyed, and the people are suffering. How can we save ourselves? The way to save ourselves is to awaken the national spirit, unite the national strength, and use the power of the entire nation to boycott Japan economically and ask the government to recover the occupied areas with revolutionary means. Use revolutionary diplomacy to achieve the goal of compensation and apology as a prerequisite for this unfortunate incident. Then, nurture strength and gradually plan to fight with the Japanese imperialists to the death. Compatriots, the situation is urgent! The troops are at the city, and the invaders are in the heartland. The survival of the country and the life and death of the nation are at stake. Let us encourage each other. Sincerely, the Shanghai Special Municipal Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>Declaration of the First District Party Department: To all newspapers and compatriots across the country, please note that Japanese imperialists, with their aggressive ambitions, seek our Manchuria and Mongolia and covet our Central Plains. The corpses of Korean compatriots have not yet dried, and the bloodstains of the martyrs in Jinan are still fresh. Old humiliations and new hatreds are vividly remembered. Now, the Nakamura Incident has occurred again. It is found that Nakamura is a retired soldier who drifted to the Northeast and has long been an adventurer. Recently, he was heavily in debt and unable to repay it, so he reported himself missing to avoid payment. However, Japan took this opportunity to send troops, demolish the Beining Railway, and bombard the soldiers and civilians of Shenyang. The situation is dangerous, and the intentions are sinister. Trampling on our territory and disregarding justice, such news has broken our hearts. Thinking of the country's peril and the loss of our rivers and mountains, how can we compatriots endure this? In this critical moment of survival, we must rise up and be inspired, urgently seek resistance, overthrow the powerful, and save our country. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Message to the Public from the Second District Party Department: Fellow compatriots, at one o'clock in the morning yesterday (September 19th), Japan sent troops and actually occupied our Shenyang (formerly Fengtian). Large numbers of troops entered the city and used force to surround important locations such as arsenals and the Beidaying. This action is a prelude to Japan's military occupation of Manchuria. It is rumored that they came for the Nakamura Incident, fearing that negotiations on the Nakamura Incident would be fruitless, so they occupied important places as a guarantee for negotiations. Fellow compatriots, Manchuria is our important northeastern gateway. Not to mention its other resources, wealth, land, and people, if it is occupied by Japan, it will be tantamount to invading our country. Imagine, if the skin does not exist, what will the hair cling to? Our party department is extremely indignant upon hearing this alarming news and is too pained to say more. We urge all compatriots to rise up together, prepare for this imminent national crisis, and fight to the death with Japan. Intensify the anti-Japanese work, and stop living in a drunken dream and waiting for death. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Telegram from the Third District Party Department: (Omitted above) Japanese imperialists are actively targeting us with their traditional policy of aggression. In recent years, the national humiliations of May 9th and May 3rd have been deeply imprinted in our hearts, and we feel even more keenly the need to deal with the Wan Incident and the Korean Incident. What has grieved the entire country is that the Japanese authorities, seeing our people's boiling anger, fabricated various rumors under the pretext of the Nakamura Incident in order to delay negotiations. Recently, they used extraordinary means to suddenly occupy our Shenyang and Changchun by force. Upon hearing the news, we are extremely pained and indignant. The world knows that Manchuria and Mongolia are the primary targets of Japanese imperialist aggression, but our countrymen are still dreaming and unaware. It is hateful and lamentable. The current plan is that our country, from top to bottom, must eliminate internal strife, unite as one, and jointly seek external solutions. There is no other way to save ourselves. This association is deeply concerned about the current national crisis and worries about the demise of the nation. We are sending a special telegram to the whole country to rise up together, completely sever economic relations with Japan, eliminate all internal disputes, unite as one, and jointly deal with the party and government authorities. Appropriate guidelines should be given to all sectors to guide their efforts. People from all walks of life should, with the spirit of coexistence and common prosperity, urge the party and government authorities to devote themselves to revolutionary diplomacy. At this critical moment of national crisis and survival, there is no other way to save ourselves. We are willing to work together with all sectors of the country to achieve the goal of overthrowing Japanese imperialism. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Third District of the Shanghai Special Municipal Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to the Nation: To all newspapers and compatriots across the country, please note that recently, banditry and famine have spread throughout the country, and the domestic political situation is in danger of peace breaking down at any time. Japan believes this is a golden opportunity that only comes once in a thousand years and wants to use the excuse to provoke and achieve its long-held ambition of annexing Manchuria and Mongolia. Those with knowledge know that prolonged infighting will not yield good results. A fire is accumulating under the stove, and an explosion is imminent. The ominous news has spread at home and abroad. The situation in the Northeast is already extremely serious and may create a disaster ten or a hundred times worse than the Jinan Incident. The people are in a critical situation of imminent demise. If we do not strive to save ourselves, how can we escape the tragic fate of the collapse of the beams and rafters? We should ask the authorities on one side to cease hostilities and carefully devise a plan to deal with external aggression. On the other side, we should prepare our resources and manpower to assist the authorities, so as to avert the danger in the slightest. We pray that with a determination to act swiftly, we can rise up together. Sincerely, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to the National Government: To the Nanjing Central Party Department and the National Government, we have sent a telegram to Guangzhou, stating that our association humbly requested the adoption of efforts to seek peace and jointly provide disaster relief. However, the situation in Hunan has not yet returned to normal, and the situation in the Northeast is tense. The news that has come is ten thousand times more serious than the incident in the fourth year of the Republic of China. We are shocked and terrified to hear this. If banditry persists internally, disaster spreads throughout the country, and enemies press into our halls, and the country still does not change its barbaric and petty infighting mentality, at this critical juncture, destruction will be seen immediately. What difference is there from helping the enemy to act as an accomplice? Regardless of what is said or how it is worded, all will be great sinners of the Chinese nation. If the nest is overturned, will the eggs remain intact? How can you gentlemen be spared? We humbly ask that you calm down and turn back, and unite to face external aggression. All those who are born with life will not treat these words as if they are spoken to the wind. We present this telegram with blood and tears, and humbly await your clear instructions. Sincerely, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Issues a Declaration: The recent tragedy of the Korean expulsion of Chinese was a conspiracy by Japanese imperialists, taking advantage of our country's internal strife, foreign troubles, natural disasters, and wars, and using the Korean people as their accomplices, instigating Koreans in Wanbaoshan to launch a large-scale riot, attacking our overseas Chinese shops, massacring our overseas Chinese merchants, and seizing the property of our overseas Chinese. After the incident, our people were filled with hatred for the enemy and rose up together, urging the National Government to lodge a strong protest with Japanese imperialists. At the same time, chambers of commerce from all over the country organized anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese aid associations, and with the eternal economic severance of relations with the imperialists as the backing, they hoped to extinguish the fierce flames of the imperialists, to comfort the souls of our distressed overseas Chinese, and to avenge the great shame of our country. Unexpectedly, Japanese imperialists ignored our government's negotiations and used insidious and ruthless methods to send the 27th Regiment and the Second Division of Korea to our Northeast on the 18th of this month, forcibly occupying our Liaoning province. The troops of the Beidaying military camp were disarmed, and news of the atrocity was shocking. The Japanese imperialists' usual pretense of friendliness has now been completely exposed. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? With such incessant aggression, it is a matter of life and death for our nation. Our people should arouse great national spirit and unite to resist foreign insults. The end is near, so let us all rise up! The Shanghai Committee of All Circles for Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Aid.</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Sends a Telegram to the Nation: Compatriots across the country, please note: We have received a telegram that Japan, under the pretext of the Nakamura Incident, has ordered the 27th Regiment to bombard Fengtian and has formally occupied the Beidaying military camp. It is planned to send four divisions to occupy the entire Northeast. The situation is critical and cannot be delayed. It has been found that in the Wanbaoshan incident, the Japanese incited foolish Koreans to massacre thousands of our compatriots. Although our country has repeatedly protested, they turned a deaf ear and instead fabricated the Nakamura Incident as an excuse to send troops to invade the Eastern Provinces. Such perverse actions have long ceased to recognize China as an independent and sovereign nation. We are the fish and they are the knife. If this can be tolerated, our country will be destroyed in no time. All compatriots, at this time of national crisis, should work together to resist foreign insults, without regard to regional boundaries or distinctions, and unite to wipe out this enemy. Our association began with anti-Japanese activities and is determined to end with anti-Japanese activities. We must intensify our work and strive to fight. We would rather build a city with bones than be slaves to a vanquished nation. The end is near, so please rise up! The Shanghai Committee of All Circles for Anti-Japanese and Overseas Chinese Aid.</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese Association Holds a Meeting Today: The Anti-Japanese Association Passed a Resolution: The situation is extremely urgent. According to reports, last night, the Japanese 27th Regiment suddenly launched a fierce attack on Liaoning City, occupying the Beidaying. The national army was disarmed, the arsenal was destroyed, and the Beining Road was cut off. The two divisions of Korea are successively being dispatched to the Eastern Provinces. The situation is serious. Our association bears the mission of anti-Japanese resistance. At this critical moment of imminent danger and survival, we should unite with a common hatred for the enemy and jointly resist foreign insults. It is hereby decided to hold an extraordinary emergency meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM on Sunday, August 20th. We deeply admire your sincerity and patriotism. We urge you to come early this time to discuss how to deal with the national crisis. The survival of the Chinese nation is at stake. The end is near, so please rise up! We look forward to your attendance and wish you peace.</p>
<p>Declarations from Various Trade Associations: It is understood that Japanese imperialists, with their aggressive policies, have been rampant in the world. Since the European War, they have been invincible. Who knew that the highly developed capitalism would lead to the inevitable economic panic of today's world? The Japanese are desperately trying to struggle, but they are rejected in the Philippines and driven out of North America. At that time, they drove the Korean people to immigrate to the Northeast, implementing their poisonous plot of the Manchuria and Mongolia policy. The Wan Incident was particularly brutal. When the terrible news came, the whole country was shocked. The Japanese continental policy is to advance inch by inch. After destroying Korea, they are plotting Manchuria and Mongolia, wanting to make the Northeast territory their own, in order to settle their country's inflated population and solve their economic depression. Sima Zhao's intentions are as clear as a torch. Japanese imperialists, regarding our country as meat on the chopping board, have increasingly exposed their ambition to carve up and swallow us. "The old shame of the Twenty-One Demands has not been avenged, and the bloodstains of the May 3rd Massacre are still fresh." Unexpectedly, the Wanbaoshan Massacre has been staged, and their intention to conquer us is even more urgent. At this critical moment, when the people of our country are jointly seeking countermeasures, they suddenly send troops to the Northeast, surround and disarm our troops, and destroy our arsenals. Within our own territory, they dare to act recklessly, and they have long regarded international law as nothing. First, they used Koreans to expel the Chinese, and then they sent troops to the Northeast to implement their ambition to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. All these actions are clearly an organized and planned attack on our country. All the people of our country should unite closely and rise up to resist, otherwise it will not be enough to survive, and it will not be enough to talk about revolution. Our country, which is called independent, is now being trampled on with no intact skin. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? If we do not urgently seek countermeasures, what kind of future can we imagine? We know that Japanese imperialists are the only obstacle to peace in East Asia. If Qingfu is not eliminated, the troubles of Lu will not end. In order to maintain peace in East Asia and safeguard human justice, we swear to overthrow the power and destroy this common enemy of the world, in order to protect the dignity of our independent nation. This is our declaration.

<p>Statements from Chinese and Japanese Authorities: Our reporter specifically visited Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun yesterday afternoon to inquire about his attitude towards dealing with the violence of the Japanese army in Shenyang. Mayor Zhang replied that regarding this matter, he had not yet received an official report from Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping, and the truth was not clear, so it was difficult to express an opinion for the time being. However, our country has absolutely no preparations for war against Japan and has no intention of waging war. This is visible and audible to the world, but Japanese soldiers have deliberately sought quarrels and provocations for more than a day or two. Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi also met with Chinese and Japanese reporters yesterday and issued a statement, saying that he was very worried about the Shenyang Incident. However, he had not yet received an official report from the Tokyo Foreign Ministry and could not freely express his opinion. If the various reports in the news telegrams were true, he believed that the situation was serious. Under the circumstances, the only way was to maintain calm and see how things developed, and then decide how to deal with them properly. He would do his best to help resolve the situation peacefully after receiving an official report from the government. Consuls from the UK and the US are also paying close attention. They all received telegrams from Shenyang yesterday, reporting the truth, but they were unable to announce it, but said that the situation was dangerous.</p>
<p>Statement from the Garrison Department: When a reporter from Huadong News Agency went to the Garrison Department, Adjutant-General Jiang had already gone out on official business. Deputy Adjutant Jin received him instead. According to Deputy Adjutant Jin, the Garrison Department only received a report from the secret agent in that area regarding the Japanese army occupying Liaoning Provincial City. There was no official news. This move by the Japanese clearly seeks to realize their dream of a continental policy, hoping to occupy the Eastern Provinces and then carve up Manchuria and Mongolia. In the past, our country's authorities had been tolerant of the Japanese in everything, causing those people to advance inch by inch, gradually to the point of openly occupying our country's territory, making people feel unbearable. I am a soldier and obey orders, and I love my country loyally. I feel heartbroken about this matter. As long as the central government determines the policy, I will not hesitate to go through fire and water. Deputy Adjutant Jin also said that the Garrison Department had already inquired of the central government about the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Sends a Telegram to Zhang and Li: After news of the Japanese occupation of the Eastern Provinces spread, Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi, who was staying in Shanghai due to illness, was very indignant. When a reporter from Huadong News Agency visited him, he immediately asked the reporter about the truth of the matter. Kong also said that after receiving this news, he immediately sent two urgent telegrams, one to Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping, inquiring about the truth of the incident, and one to Central Committee members Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhang Ji, asking them to immediately telegram the Cantonese side to immediately stop sending troops and unite to face external aggression. Because at this time of urgent survival, if our country engages in internal strife again, it is tantamount to hastening its own demise. He sincerely hoped that the Cantonese generals would receive this warning, stop the war in awe, and obey the central government to unite against foreign aggression to save China.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Shenyang Telegraph Communication: After the Japanese army began military action the night before, the submarine telegraph lines from Shanghai to Shenyang were cut off and could not be used for reporting. However, the local Ministry of Communications' wireless telegraph was still able to communicate with the Shenyang wireless telegraph station at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Later, due to the Japanese army's obstruction, it was not allowed to communicate, and it could not communicate from 8:30 AM. The Yingkou telegraph station was also out of communication at the same time. However, the Shanghai and Harbin telegraph stations were communicating as usual. Telegrams sent from here to various places in the three eastern provinces were all forwarded by the Harbin station or sent by special messengers.</p>
<p>Cessation of Northeast Goods Transportation: Yesterday afternoon, upon receiving this alert, the Hakkas temporarily stopped reporting and transporting the goods that should have been loaded. Export goods to Dalian were also watching and not loading.</p>
<p>Secret Meeting of the South Manchuria Railway Branch: At 12:00 PM yesterday, Japanese employees of all businesses related to the South Manchuria Railway stopped working and gathered at the Shanghai branch of the South Manchuria Railway on the 24th floor of the Bund to hold an emergency secret meeting. From 1:00 PM until late at night, they had a long secret discussion regarding the occurrence of the situation, the mission and work that the Japanese in Shanghai should bear, and various preparations for business. The meeting was very strict, and non-participants were not allowed to attend. It was heard that communication with the head office was very close.</p>
<p>Joint Conference of Japanese Residents: Furthermore, according to information obtained from a certain source, Japanese political, military, business, and overseas residents in Shanghai held two meetings yesterday. The first meeting was held at the Japanese Consulate General at 11:00 AM, attended by Japanese Minister Shigemitsu, Japanese Consul General Murai, Military Attaché Tasiro of the Japanese Embassy, Naval Attaché Kitaoka, Shiba Yama, Commander of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, Staff Officer Yasuda, Fukushima and Okamoto of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mirisato, Chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, Hayashidajima, Chairman of the Union of Business Associations, and Yasui, Acting Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Administrative Committee. A Committee for the Protection of Overseas Residents was then established. The committee held a meeting at the Japan Club at 2:00 PM. Both meetings were strictly guarded, and the contents were not detailed. However, it was learned that a calm attitude was temporarily adopted.</p>
<p>Actions of the Japanese Marine Corps: There are 400 Japanese Marines in Shanghai. According to news from the Japanese side yesterday, Marine Corps Staff Officer Tomosada said that if there were fluctuations in Shanghai due to the Fengtian Japanese soldiers occupying the event, the Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai had already discussed a plan to deploy temporarily to areas where Japanese residents live. On the one hand, it can deploy, and on the other hand, it can transfer more Japanese Marines to China. Today, an emergency meeting was held at the Consulate General, and representatives from the Marine Corps, the militia, and the various union associations, a total of 14 people, attended and discussed measures to protect the Japanese in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Disaster Relief News from Various Provinces <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>News on Reception Centers for Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Invitation to Various Sectors for a Tour in the Coming Days: After the relocation of disaster victims, the city's First Reception Center has completed its registration. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau, noting a lack of understanding from the outside world regarding the city's disaster victim reception efforts, specifically scheduled a tour for Mayor Zhang, as well as party and government organs, various organizations, and Chinese and foreign press outlets, to the reception center located at the end of Gonghe New Road, Tan Jia Qiao, and Liu Ying Road at 11:00 AM on the 22nd of this month (Tuesday).</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Disaster Victims Funded to Return to Hubei: One hundred and thirty-six disaster victims from Huangmei County, Hubei, had been in Shanghai for over twenty days. They were initially sheltered at the Chao Hui Villa by the Shanghai Disaster Relief Office. Now, as the floodwaters in their hometown have receded and their fields and homes urgently need repair, they earnestly requested to be sent back home. Yesterday, the office sent personnel to negotiate preferential transportation rates with Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, agreeing that the office would subsidize each person's meals at two yuan. They would be transported to Jiujiang on the Xiangyang Maru, and each disaster victim would receive an additional one yuan to cover their return journey from Xun. These funds were entrusted to the comprador of the Xiangyang Maru for distribution before arriving at Xun. Last night, the office dispatched Mr. Sun Wan'er, along with police officers, to escort them onto the ship, which was completed by 2:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Disaster Victims Begging Along the Streets: In recent days, a large number of disaster victims have arrived in Shanghai. Some claim to be searching for relatives and friends, refusing accommodation and causing disturbances, making it difficult to manage them. Recently, people claiming to be disaster victims have been seen begging for money on roadsides and in alleyways, making it hard to distinguish between genuine cases and impostors. It's uncertain whether they are truly unsuccessful in finding relatives and have become stranded on the streets, or if they are vagrants impersonating disaster victims to solicit money. The Disaster Relief Office is deeply dissatisfied with this situation. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, instructing officers on duty to send anyone found begging to the reception center for verification and handling. They are also planning to establish temporary reception centers specifically for disaster victims seeking relatives and friends. The First Reception Center is currently insufficient to accommodate everyone, so an additional hundred or so rooms are being constructed nearby as the Second Reception Center. They are also considering borrowing vacant land from the Commercial Press at Song Park Road on Zhongxing Road to build a Third Reception Center.</p>
<p>Fujian Alumni in Shanghai Donate Clothing: Wu Renwen, a student at the University of Shanghai, previously donated several items of his own clothing. Subsequently, he gathered Fujian alumni at the school to organize a clothing donation drive, widely soliciting contributions. Yesterday, they sent over two hundred and eighty items of clothing, shoes, and socks to the office for distribution to disaster victims.</p>
<p>Flood Relief Association Remits Relief Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces remitted the following amounts to various locations yesterday: (1) 50,000 yuan transferred to Wang Pinggeng through the Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce (remitted by the Shanghai Bank); (2) 50,000 yuan transferred to Zhao Youqin through Li Zushen of the Hankou Mingde Hotel; (3) 50,000 yuan to Zhou Baipeng of the Jiujiang Red Cross; (4) 30,000 yuan to Liu Lingsheng of the Bengbu Electric Light Factory; (5) 10,000 yuan to Gao Weixuan and Zhang Zhiheng of the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce; (6) 20,000 yuan to Zhang Gongheng of the Anhui Red Swastika Society; (7) 5,000 yuan to Zhai Zhancheng of the Wuhu Infant Nursery; (8) 25,000 yuan to Xu Pingxuan at No. 17 Tiantai Lane, Anqing (all remitted by the Bank of China). Additionally, the association remitted 20,000 yuan to the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce on the 15th of the month, 20,000 yuan to Xu Pingxuan in Hefei, Anhui, and 40,000 yuan to Wang Pinggeng in Kaifeng. On the 16th, they remitted 90,000 yuan to the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association for emergency relief in Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The Yancheng Flood Relief Association Appeals for Aid</p>
<p>To all newspaper offices: Please note that Yancheng has unfortunately suffered from continuous drought for four years. This summer, the simultaneous opening of three dams has submerged all the crops. We have been striving to protect the remaining dikes to preserve the lives of our people, but unexpectedly, the You Shao Dike has collapsed. In a moment, terrifying waves and raging currents swept away floating corpses and swallowed boats. People fled for their lives, unable to find refuge even on rooftops and treetops. Recently, the water continues to rise, and the harbors are silted up. The water depth on the plains is over ten feet, and everything outside the city has become an ocean. We have established reception centers, but the city is narrow and overcrowded, resources are scarce, and funds are depleted. The entire area is awaiting assistance. We urgently implore compatriots at home and abroad to contribute grain and funds to alleviate the hunger and suffering as soon as possible. We are in deep sorrow. The Yancheng Flood Relief Committee bows in supplication.</p>
<p>Red Cross Remits Funds for Hankou Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram yesterday from the Hankou branch stating, "We acknowledge receipt of twenty boxes of mixed vaccines sent to us, which Nisshin Kisen Kaisha delivered in full on [day redacted]. We are deeply grateful. However, the work is intense and funds are scarce. We still hope for a swift allocation of relief funds to avoid losing all our efforts. We hereby express our gratitude and hope for generous assistance." Upon receiving the telegram, the society immediately replied, "The flood situation in Hankou is extremely severe. Your branch's emergency relief efforts have been remarkably successful. We have submitted a request for relief funds to the 109th Standing Committee meeting for discussion." It was decided that 2,000 foreign dollars would be approved for allocation to provide assistance. It is reported that the funds were remitted in full to Hankou by the Shanghai Bank on [day redacted].</p>

<p>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</p>
<p>The Post-Disaster Relief Association for the Water Disaster in Yancheng, Funing, Taizhou, and Dongtai, Jiangsu, cries out: Since the collapse of the canal embankment, the water disaster has deepened in the lower reaches of various counties. The damming work is difficult to complete quickly, so we have to seek a way out of the sea ports as soon as possible. Previously, the provincial government appointed Section Chief He Haiqiao, along with Xu Ji, a technician from the Construction Department, and Councilor Zhang of the Pacification Superintendent's Office, to lead a team to Dongtai to open the Sanmao You River within the enclaves of the Dafeng and Yuhua Companies, as well as various dikes and dams that blocked the water. They arrived in Dongtai on the evening of September 6th and immediately convened a meeting to decide to first open the various Mao You Rivers and the dams that block the westward flow of water to the sea, and then open the Eight Hundred Zhang. Huang, the magistrate of Dongtai County, has written records to prove it. All of our disaster victims celebrated their rebirth upon hearing the news. Unexpectedly, after the committee members contacted the company, they suddenly reversed their previous decision, declaring that their mission in Dongtai was only to open the Eight Hundred Zhang, and they did not mention a word about the various Mao You Rivers and dams that blocked the water. On a certain day, they fabricated a telegram to the provincial government, saying that they had discussed with Dongtai Magistrate Huang and various representatives the opening of the Eight Hundred Zhang, and all the preparations could start this morning. The company's various Mao You River earth dams have been automatically opened, etc. In fact, the company had already driven piles at the mouths of the various Mao You Rivers, reducing the size of the openings, and built many hidden dams every seven and a half miles within the river, thus making the water flow unhindered, in order to deal with public orders and deceive the disaster victims. Opening the dams was just a name; it was not actually done, which only trapped the disaster victims of the five counties to death. It is understood that this time, the canal embankment was breached, and the floodwaters overflowed, flooding more than 100,000 square miles. The number of affected people reached millions, and the death of people and animals and the loss of property are countless, more than one ten-thousandth of the company's capital and occupied fields. Moreover, the land occupied by the company originally had seven Doulonggang diversion rivers: (1) Dongyang River, (2) Jiangjia Ditch, (3) Xiudejia Ditch, (4) Xiaohali Port, (6) Dagouzi, (7) Sangang, all of which were official sea ports in the past. When the western water flowed down, this was the only way to discharge water. Due to the establishment of Dafeng Company, they were privately filled up. In the face of this catastrophic disaster, even if we do not restore the above ports one by one to their old ways to fulfill the legal responsibilities, we should also ask ourselves about our conscience in terms of human sympathy and open up all the water-blocking dikes, dams, and sluices as soon as possible to try to save the situation. However, the company turned a blind eye to it, initially refused to open, and fabricated various floating words to confuse the public. On the one hand, they instigated tenants to demonstrate with weapons, which almost led to a major disaster. Later, after repeated urging by the provincial government, they clearly agreed to open, but still used means to make the opening only exist in name. The outside world did not know it, thinking that the Eight Hundred Zhang had been opened, which was enough to discharge the water. They did not know that the so-called Eight Hundred Zhang was a section of the people's land on the eastern end of the Zhongmao You River to the Dawang Port, which the company had been trying to open for many years. Now, they are working specifically from here to achieve the company's wishes. The floods in the five counties are still the same, and the company's plan is completed first, reversing the importance of things and abandoning the root and pursuing the end. What is even more strange is that the company claims that the terrain of the seaside is higher in the east than in the west. Even if the dikes and sluices are opened, it is difficult to discharge the water. If this is the case, then what is the use of all the five ports and the company's various Mao You Rivers? How can the company explain its advocacy of opening the Eight Hundred Zhang? At present, the water situation in the five counties has already spread to the sea if it is not blocked by the company's embankment. The so-called higher in the east than in the west and unable to discharge water is just a prevarication. The facts are obvious and do not need much debate. In fact, if our five counties are submerged for a long time, millions of people will become starving. May I ask if the company can be safe and sound? Thinking about it later, we will suddenly realize and understand. Recently, it was found that the important shareholders of the company are all famous people in the world. There are also people who are running around to beg for relief for the disaster in the five counties. Our people in the five counties are so grateful that they cannot distinguish between gratitude and grievances. That's why we talk so much. However, it is not easy for the company to work hard to manage this situation. It is difficult to sacrifice interests for the people of the five counties, and it is also normal for people to be difficult. If the company can resolutely and decisively open up the various Mao You Rivers and open up more breaches in all the water-blocking dikes and sluices to save our millions of dying people, the people of the five counties will be able to repay the kindness in the days to come, or reduce food and clothing, or collect food with the grain, which can also make up for its losses. This is what we want to solemnly declare. In short, the damming in the upper reaches takes time, and the relief tickets everywhere are limited. To solve the life-and-death problem of millions of people in these five counties, the only important thing now is to open up the lower reaches first. To open up the lower reaches, we must first open up the various Mao You Rivers of Dafeng and Yuhua Companies and all the dikes, sluices, and dams that block water. The situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. In addition to asking the provincial government to implement this pain immediately, we also ask all circles to support each other, advocate justice, and urge the company not to block it any longer. We are extremely grateful and weep bitterly. We hereby make this appeal.</p>
<p>Lake Society Speaks Out for Disaster-Stricken Villagers</p>
<p>The Lake Society sent a letter to Magistrate Li yesterday regarding the matter of recovering overdue taxes in the disaster-stricken area of Wuxing, requesting its immediate withdrawal. The original letter is as follows: Respectfully, we have received a letter from Fei Shulun and others, the standing committee members of the Second Branch of the Third District of the Wuxing County Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, stating, "This autumn, continuous rain has caused a disaster, especially in our Lake area. The fields and crops have all turned into a swamp, and cries of sorrow are heard everywhere. The scene is too horrible to bear. Although various organizations, legal entities, and gentry are conducting investigations and raising funds for emergency relief, the disaster-stricken people are still worried that the benefits will be difficult to spread to everyone. Unexpectedly, before the emergency relief is released, the mobile tax collectors have come to collect overdue taxes, which is as urgent as a fire, making people even more anxious. The pumps and water wheels are naturally weak. At this time of year when the old grain is exhausted and the new grain is not yet available, it is a time when people's hearts are floating. The urging of the tax collectors is deeply feared to cause incidents. The country's grain tax has not been completed, and the order of the villages and neighborhoods has been disrupted. Your society is concerned about your hometown, so we earnestly ask you to write separate letters to withdraw the dispatched tax collectors immediately to alleviate the people's difficulties, etc." We have approved this. We have found that the area affected by this year's flood is vast. Not only have the fields and crops been submerged, and the autumn harvest is hopeless, but also the mulberry trees and shrubs have been submerged and withered. This kind of catastrophe is, as your government's previous telegram said, unable to restore the original state for three or four years. Our society has received letters and telegrams from various counties one after another, reporting the disaster situation. We have truthfully reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate the disaster area and exempt the land tax, and allocate special construction donations to repair the dikes. We have received a reply from the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department, stating that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has forwarded your society's letter regarding flood relief. It has been transferred to the Zhejiang Relief Office to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections with the county, allocate funds for distribution, and exempt this year's land tax and allocate funds for repairing the dikes, and has issued orders to the competent departments to handle them separately. The land tax is a regular supply and should not be reduced lightly, but the disaster area is in a terrible situation. The gentry and merchants have risen to maintain it, and the officials should have compassion. At this time when the provincial constitution is sending personnel to conduct on-site inspections, it is the autumn when the suburbs set up porridge for the hungry. Checking the telegram from the party department, we find that the tax collection is still going on. We believe that Magistrate Li of your county is clean and self-disciplined and has no intention of seeking performance evaluation. We fear that the clerks are mixed and disorderly, and it is difficult to obtain cheap chickens. Or they may use the pretext of not paying the protection fee to claim to collect taxes. Even if they do not wrongly accept silk and grain, and run around, even if there are noble wines and dishes, it is difficult to hide the guilt of disturbance, causing the neighborhood to be disturbed, women and children to be frightened, and the old and weak to weep. If we handle it too hastily, it will inevitably lead to escape or banditry, which will spread and cause trouble. Approving the contents of the letter, in addition to replying to the letter, we should truthfully inform you and ask your magistrate to quickly instruct the director of tax collection to withdraw all the dispatched tax collectors and the tax collection forms that have been issued before the exemption of land tax is determined, so as to relieve the distress and avoid harassment, and also ask you to reply to us with the handling situation for record. Regarding public friendship, this is to Magistrate Li, the magistrate of Wuxing County.</p>
<p>News of Assistance from Various Circles</p>
<p>Hua An Company Donates 10,500 Yuan: The Hua An Hequn Life Insurance Company, after a board meeting, decided to donate 10,000 yuan, and the Pre-Shipping Insurance Association raised 500 yuan, totaling 10,500 yuan. The company's general manager, Mr. Lu Yuequan, has sent a letter to the Flood Relief Association.</p>
<p>The Final Stage of Fundraising by the Jiande Society: The China Jiande Society held a variety show fundraising event on the 5th, 6th, 12th, and 13th of this month. After deducting the cost of tea snacks for entertaining guests, the remaining items were converted into cash and added to the relief funds. According to the society's report on the total amount of income and expenditure, it collected a total of 3,800 yuan, with expenses of about 1,500 yuan. All the funds have been remitted separately, and the chairman, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, has sent them to the Shanghai Flood Relief Association for collection and distribution.</p>
<p>The Western Clothing Industry Association Raises More Than 2,000 Yuan: The Shanghai Western Clothing Industry Association convened a meeting of member representatives to raise funds for flood relief. In addition to the 700 yuan raised on the spot, they also appointed more than ten people, including Wang Lianli, Wang Rongqing, Wang Hexing, and Xia Xiaoqing, to solicit donations separately. It is reported that they have raised more than 2,000 yuan by the end of the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Donations from Radio Operators of the Ministry of Communications Remitted to Hankou: The Tongyi Society of the Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications previously decided to allocate 100 yuan from the membership fee. The staff of the station, believing that the disaster in Hanzhong City was more serious and in urgent need of rescue, voluntarily collected more than 100 yuan. Zhu Qiqing, the management engineer of the station, also donated some money. All the money was sent directly to the Tongyi Society of the Hankou Radio Station for the members to distribute to the victims so as to avoid detours and provide real benefits.</p>
<p>Proposal for Raising Funds to Select Cattle for Plowing: Xiang Songmao and others sent a letter to the Flood Relief Association of Various Provinces, saying: We respectfully inform you that flood relief is difficult in the aftermath. The water will recede in autumn and winter, and spring plowing will begin in a blink of an eye. There is one thing that must be prepared now to avoid being unprepared at the time, and that is plowing cattle. All the plowing cattle in the disaster area are either slaughtered or sold. People in the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau told us that the city has temporarily added several cattle slaughtering sites. This is a confirmation that the number of cattle sellers has increased, and most of those slaughtered are plowing cattle. Although the government has explicitly banned it, there is nothing it can do. Not only do philanthropists feel sorry for it, but may I ask who will work next year if we sell them this year to fill our stomachs? Our association is sincerely committed to providing relief. Once the spring plowing starts, there will be no cattle at all. What can we do then? Seeds can still be purchased from other places, or even from foreign countries, but plowing cattle cannot be purchased. The dead cannot be resurrected, and the species cannot be continued. We are deeply worried and believe that the simplest way to remedy this is to select cattle that are strong and usable from each cattle slaughtering ground in Shanghai every day, purchase and keep some of them, designate rate pastures, store feed, and prevent diseases. Spread more calves. Once the spring plowing begins, distribute them to various places. Farmers who have the strength can buy them, and those who do not have the strength can be rewarded. Although it cannot completely supply the lack, it can restore a share of cultivation and preserve the life of the farmer and preserve a glimmer of hope for the society. This matter is urgent. If we do not plan now, we will not be able to provide relief at the time. We heard from the section chief of the Health Bureau that an average of 130 cattle are slaughtered every day in the entire city of Shanghai, and the price per head is 50, 60, 70 or 80 yuan. If we select 30 cattle every day, and count 1,000 cattle, it will cost about 60,000 or 70,000 yuan. Add equipment and several months of feeding and disease prevention fees, about 100,000 yuan, and we can select and raise more than 1,000 cattle. We plan to propose to our association to first draw 100,000 yuan from the relief funds, and at the same time discuss with various banks to raise a larger amount of money, select and raise more cattle, and at the same time send a letter to the Municipal Social Affairs and Health Bureaus to jointly set up a place and start implementation on a regular basis. The opportunity is urgent, and we respectfully request that you submit it to the meeting as soon as possible. We hope that you will decide to implement it immediately. We respectfully offer our opinions and wait for your public inspection. We wish you peace.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Du Yuesheng, Mu Ouchu, and Others Send a Telegram to the Provincial Government and Departments Regarding the Protection of the Embankment <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Hairbreadth Emergency Repair Project</p>
<p>Speaking Out for Tens of Millions of People</p>
<p>Shanghai gentry Du Yuesheng, Mu Ouchu, and others, aware of the great disaster of Hankou's submergence, were particularly concerned about the recent destruction of the sea embankment in the most important areas such as Songkou. They went to inspect it separately. Because this matter is too important, it concerns the lives and property of tens of millions of people in Shanghai and the coastal counties. If a storm suddenly hits during the flood season, with the current perfunctory sea embankment project, there is a risk of imminent collapse. They also found that during the Qianlong period, the embankment of the Liuhuo Daotang Temple was washed away, and the sea tide surged, flooding the coastal towns to Wuxi and beyond, turning them all into swamps. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Liuhuo City and Gancao Town were both washed away. The above records in the historical books are still frightening. Based on the findings of the investigation, they sent a telegram to the provincial government and departments on [day redacted], asking them to urgently order the responsible personnel to rush to repair it. People in Shanghai should urgently rise up and pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The Telegram is Recorded Below: Chairman Ye, Director Sun, may your administration flourish: The Shangdou Sea Embankment has been eroded by the storm tide on August 25th, and there is a great danger of not being able to protect it in the morning and evening. The public is panicked, saying that if the storm on that day had been extended for two hours, the entire Shanghai would have been submerged. Fortunately, the wind direction suddenly changed and a major disaster was avoided. However, since the sea embankment was eroded, the danger has been increasing day by day. On September 14th, people in Shanghai gathered to discuss and agreed that the situation was critical. Yong Xiang, Yue Qingyuan, and others were publicly recommended to conduct on-site inspections. On the 7th, Xiang and Yong's representative, Pan Hongding, and Shi Junwenran and Lu Junjingqing, went to Baoshan to inspect. They found that Section 5 of the Baotang Chenhua Beach, Section 4 of Zhangjiazhai, and the tail section were all precarious. Section 3 of Xuejia Beach was particularly dangerous. The lower layers of the embankment at the above locations and nearby had been eroded into countless large and small holes. People passing by were worried about the danger of falling into a trap. The seawater could rush into the gaps at any time, but the rough workers actually filled the surface to cover it up, which is deeply strange for the supervisors to fail to detect. Moreover, the road on the tail section of the Xuejia Beach embankment is only a foot wide, and people can only walk by bending over, which is particularly dangerous. It was also found that the first section of the Gu Longdun and other places did not even have speed piles. In addition, many important places had slightly placed speed piles without filling in the mud. Even in the places where construction was underway, no new stones were seen to strengthen the embankment. The newly driven speed piles were all one and a half zhang long logs, which were too short and unsuitable for defense. If one zhang and eight-foot logs were used, it would avoid debt. Regarding the engineering layer, we also inquired with the workers, who said that Director Xue only gave one yuan and one jiao per cubic foot (given by the Jiangnan Embankment Engineering Office), including all the procedures such as bagging, flattening, and picking mud. As a result, many workers were unwilling to work and left. All in all, only one-tenth or two-tenths of the dangerous parts of the emergency repair project have been completed so far. However, the person in charge of the project reported that seven-tenths or eight-tenths have been completed, which is far from the truth. In addition, the progress is slow and the measures are inconsistent, which can be seen everywhere. The Mid-Autumn Festival flood is approaching. We are doing the emergency repair project, but we lack the spirit of emergency repair. If a storm suddenly comes during the flood season, it will immediately become a major disaster like the Yangtze and Han Rivers. How can the coastal counties and Shanghai be imagined? Yong and others are in this dangerous situation and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we truthfully and painstakingly report and appeal to Chairman and Director Xue to quickly complete the emergency repair project to prevent a major disaster, and we cannot bear to wait for the lives of tens of millions of people. As for whether to send other competent personnel to cooperate in rushing to handle the emergency repair project within a limited time to avoid accidents, we respectfully await your decision. Du Yong, Mu Xiangyue, [day redacted].</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Municipal Party Department Asks to Formulate Municipal Policy Guidelines <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Sent a Letter to the Municipal Government Yesterday for Handling</p>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee sent a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday to determine the policy guidelines and forward them to the council for review, so that there would be a basis for evaluating political achievements. The original letter is excerpted as follows: Respectfully, we have received Public Letter No. 33 from the Municipal Supervisory Committee, which states, "Respectfully, we have found that the Supervisory Committees at all levels have the responsibility of auditing the policy guidelines and political achievements of the governments at the same level. Since the General Charter has clear regulations, it is our committee's duty to follow them. However, we have found that the Municipal Government has submitted municipal reports and business reports from various bureaus on a yearly and monthly basis for the political achievements part, which can be used for review. Regarding the policy guidelines item, except for the policy outline of the 17th year attached to the Municipal Government's report at the Fifth Municipal Representative Congress in May 18th, we have not seen such a policy guideline formulated and forwarded to the council in previous years. Whether the Municipal Government uses this policy outline as a substitute for the future policy guidelines, or if there is another compilation, we cannot verify it. Even in terms of this policy outline, the contents and clauses are very simple. For example, the construction of the city center area is of such importance, but it is not mentioned in the outline. Moreover, it has been several years since then, and there are many differences. It is very clear that this outline is not enough for the future policy guidelines. According to the central government's 'Explanation of Article 3 and Article 4 of the General Rules for the Supervisory Committees at All Levels to Audit the Policy Guidelines and Political Achievements of the Governments at the Same Level,' the policy guidelines set by the government should be sent to the party department for auditing at any time. When government officials change, the newly appointed officials will send the policy guidelines they have set, etc. Therefore, the policy outline of the 17th year was sent by the previous officials. The current officials should base themselves on the six-year term of political tutelage and implement the principles and policies of the party and all laws and regulations that must be implemented during the political tutelage period. They should divide them into steps and periods and formulate a precise and complete policy guideline, so that all future administrative construction can be based on this principle and progress step by step, and avoid the drawbacks of changing from time to time without any standards. This matter concerns the central government's laws and regulations. We should send a letter to your council to forward to the Municipal Government to determine a policy guideline in the shortest possible time and forward it to the council, so that there will be a basis for reviewing political achievements. We wish you public friendship, etc." We have approved this and should send a letter to you to handle it and please reply in advance for our record.</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Garrison Command Orders Liu Zhen to Surrender Within Ten Days <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Otherwise, Arrest and Strict Punishment Will Follow</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command announced the details of handling the case of the Shanghai Military and Political News Agency, stating: "In April of this year, the Songhu Garrison Command received a secret report stating that the Shanghai Military and Political News Agency was involved in transmitting information to the reactionary faction. Furthermore, the agency was named 'Military and Political,' implying a close relationship with military and political affairs, which could not be ignored. The command then ordered its investigation team to investigate the agency's content and instructed the postal inspection office to pay attention to checking the agency's mail. Later, the agency's president, Liu Zhen, sent a letter stating that the agency had been registered with the Shanghai Municipal Party Department. A letter was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to verify the agency's content, and the Party Department replied that the agency was engaging in deceptive practices and had been refused registration. According to the investigation report, combined with the previous information, and suspicious letters from the agency intercepted by the postal inspection office, were submitted for review and handling. The command then reported this to the Commander-in-Chief's office for instructions. Instruction No. 129 from the Chief of Staff stated that since the agency had not been registered with the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, all incoming and outgoing correspondence should be withheld. However, considering that formal troops and organizations were occasionally misled by the agency, resulting in the submission of photos, biographies, and funds, withholding all of these seemed inappropriate. The command then reported this to the Commander-in-Chief's office, requesting that the photos, biographies, and funds be returned separately, and ordered all troops and organizations not to communicate with the agency in the future to prevent deception. Instruction No. 1359 from the Chief of Staff approved this arrangement. However, last month, the command received a report from the postal inspection office stating that Liu Zhen of the Military and Political News Agency had mailed multiple printed materials from Nanjing, falsely claiming that the command had withheld the agency's correspondence and that the director of the Chief of Staff's office had been bribed by Li Jianhong. The command found that there was no such person as the director of the Chief of Staff's office and that the case had proceeded as described above. Fearing that petty individuals would use false pretenses to damage the reputation, the command transferred the entire case to the military law office for investigation and assigned personnel to go to Beijing to summon Liu Zhen for questioning. Unexpectedly, Liu Zhen fled midway, avoiding the summons, and instead sent a letter to the Chief of Staff of the command today, making threats at will. To thoroughly investigate the matter, the command has announced that Liu Zhen is required to surrender himself for questioning within ten days and provide evidence for investigation. If he continues to evade the summons, it will be considered a fabrication of facts and damage to reputation, and he will be arrested and severely punished."</p>

<p>Onboard the Hua'an Merchant Ship</p>
<p>Admiral Du Xigui, since being appointed Principal of the Mawei Naval Academy in Fujian Province by the Central Government, had been staying in Shanghai due to illness for several months. Having now recovered, he boarded the Hua'an merchant ship of the Chang'an Shipping Company yesterday (the 19th) to go to Fujian. At 9 AM, his luggage was first moved onto the ship. At 3 PM, Mr. Du, accompanied by Staff Officer Wang Xianqi, Secretary Zheng, and three or four others, arrived at the 16th Pier from his residence on Fulu Li Road by car. They boarded a naval launch to reach the Hua'an, which was docked in the middle of the river.</p>
<p>Local naval figures, such as Commander Chen Xunyong, personally went to the pier to welcome him. The battalion commander of the naval guard battalion, Ye Baoqi, and platoon leader Wang Wenbo led a platoon of guards to the pier for security. The ship set sail at 4:05 PM, and those who came to see him off gradually dispersed. It is estimated that they will arrive at Mawei tomorrow (the 21st).</p>
<h3 id="e87">Reasons for Shanghai County's Reassessment of Land Prices <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The land prices in various districts of the county were assessed in the 17th year of the Republic during the tenure of former County Magistrate Lu, according to the instructions of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, and divided into three grades: 60 yuan, 90 yuan, and 150 yuan, equivalent to 100 yuan per mu. The reason for this reassessment is that the county's operating expenses have reached their limit and are insufficient for allocation. The collection of land taxes has already reached 1%, and according to regulations, it cannot be increased further, hindering the progress of undertakings. Wang Huazhao, the Director of the County Finance Bureau, considered that increasing land prices was the fairest way to supplement the land tax revenue. Upon investigating the land prices in neighboring counties, it was found that they were all higher than those in this county, which was unfair. Therefore, he drafted his opinions and submitted them to the county government, which convened a meeting of various agencies to discuss the matter. It was decided that the burden on the people should also be considered, so the land prices were changed to 170 yuan, 105 yuan, and 70 yuan per mu, equivalent to 115 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Captains Association Fighting for Navigation Rights <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, there has been an increasing number of talented people in China's navigation industry. The Shanghai Captains Association is requesting all Chinese shipping companies to have all captains, chief officers, and second officers be Chinese nationals to regain navigation rights. Their letter is as follows: Esteemed Sirs, since the opening of trade, the navigation industry has been monopolized by foreigners for a long time. The hub of transportation, the shipping of industry and commerce, all are under the control of others, causing hardship for the people and outflow of wealth, which is simply immeasurable. In recent times, enlightened people have been calling out, contributing their assets and intellect to establish shipping companies to regain these rights. This remedial measure is not too late. As the saying goes, "To travel far, begin near; to climb high, begin low." Given the ardent patriotism of the Chinese people and their fear of a ruined nest and fragile eggs, we have been urging them to do more. Domestic industry and commerce are now relying on the shipping industry for transportation, whether to transport goods or to import goods that are needed in the country, which is of great significance. We cannot ignore the diligent efforts of the sages in China today, who are just starting their work and laying the foundation. Although the navigation industry is a specialized field of knowledge, the loss of our country's navigation rights is due to unequal treaties. It must also be said that it is because our country has long lacked specialized talent in this field, and we have had to rely on foreign talent, which has led to others taking advantage of us and created a situation of the magpie occupying the dove's nest. In recent years, many graduates from maritime academies have emerged, and their talent and expertise are sufficient to compete with foreign sailors. The organization of our association, with all its members being specialized captains who have graduated from various academies, is the highest driving art group in the Chinese navigation field. Through the long-term efforts and struggles of our colleagues, we have resisted foreign powers and broken the bad habits of Chinese people favoring the West and suppressing the Chinese. Currently, dozens of our colleagues are serving as captains, chief officers, and second officers in various companies, which is an unprecedented achievement. However, given the vastness of our country, the length of our coastline, and the fact that the shipping industry is just beginning to flourish, the need for captains in the future will be immense. Therefore, our expectations are high and our responsibilities are heavy. To regain navigation rights, our colleagues are ready to offer their services and compete with foreigners. We are not afraid to recommend ourselves. If your company needs captains, whether they are captains, chief officers, or second officers, our association can select and recommend excellent candidates. We believe that your patriotic heart will regard this matter as a crucial plan, not to be compared with those who seek personal gain. Moreover, foreign sailors are arrogant and do whatever they want, which is a deep pain for shipowners. Even if some Chinese people have a liking for scabies, they may not be so willing to sell out their country and lose their rights. Our association has spoken at length and with great sincerity. We hope that you will consider our words and instruct us. We respectfully present our opinions and look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, The Chinese Merchant Ship Captains Association, Xu Jijie, Ji Qingrong, Chen Ganqing, Chen Jingxing, Yang Zhixiong, Huang Xiaohan, Jin Yueshi, Huang Hongqian, Ju Gong.</p>

<p>In the "Reader's Correspondence" section of the fourth page of the Shen Bao on the 18th, there was a passage titled "Message from Mr. So-and-So." I felt very sympathetic after reading it because I had already had the same idea and was planning to write something to seek like-minded comrades. It is even better that this sympathetic person has come before me. Let us take advantage of this corner to gather a few like-minded sympathetic people. We plan to study horticulture, fruits, vegetables, and all kinds of crops. We hope to personally go to the nearby countryside for practical experiments, and from these experiments, we will achieve the great cause in our ideal. Therefore, those who respond must have at least the following points: 1. Have the habit of diligence, thrift, and endurance. 2. Have the idea of saving the country through agriculture. 3. Have an extreme interest in agronomy. 4. Have a firm and great ambition. 5. Have a legitimate profession and not be a vagrant. 6. Have noble character (gender is not limited). If any of the readers sympathize and think our idea is worthwhile, please write your mailing address and send it to Pan Xiaohong, C/O Gonghe Caiwen Printing Company, West Fuzhou Road, Shanghai. I will reply to each letter, exchange ideas, and conduct research. (September 18, 20th year of the Republic)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Message from Mr. Yang Jianhu <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>My experiences during the four years I have been in middle school have told me that if someone has the possibility, willingness, and perseverance to study on their own, they can certainly learn at home, and the benefits they receive can be equal to or even greater than what they can gain from studying at school. Because today's schools still rely entirely on students' ability to make progress on their own, it is futile to rely on teachers' assistance and guidance for a few hours each day. I firmly believe that this is correct. Not only that, but studying at school also wastes valuable time on courses that are mostly impractical and not related to one's interests, as well as the rigid classroom life. Therefore, I want to take advantage of the fact that I now have a foundation in all subjects to break free from the constraints of school and prepare to study at home, choosing only the subjects that interest me and are practical as textbooks. This will save a lot of time wasted on superficial schoolwork. Moreover, being at home can also give my mother constant comfort and relieve her anxiety (my parents are both in Guangdong). As for the school diploma, that is irrelevant because I see that when people go out to serve society, even university graduates inevitably end up unemployed. It is better to find opportunities to learn through experience in advance. Therefore, I have no intention of going to university. As long as one has real talent, a diploma is simply not enough to represent it and is useless. This is my humble opinion. When I have studied to a certain extent on my own, I would like to work in the customs or postal service. I haven't told my parents yet, but I don't think they will object to my plan. Before making a final decision and before telling my parents, I sincerely ask you to give me some guidance. Also, I think there must be many other scholars who have the same problem to solve. I hope you will not hesitate to use your space to answer me in your newspaper. I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your observations are very accurate and your intentions are very sincere. We admire you very much. In view of the shortcomings of the school system and the inadequacy of diplomas to represent academic ability, you wish to choose the subjects that interest you and are practical to study at home. This will save time wasted on superficial work and give your dear mother comfort. Your plan is thorough and well-considered. We very much agree with it. However, for young people in general, there are two points worth studying: 1. If there is no place or opportunity for quiet study at home, and the person lacks the ability to self-discipline and self-study, then studying at home often leads to aimlessness and decadence, with little practical progress and systematic knowledge. 2. In addition to schoolwork, there is one thing that is not easily obtained at home, which is the development of social skills and the practice of self-governance. If the school spirit is good, this is very important from an educational point of view, especially in our country where the general public lacks the cultivation of communal living. These two points may not be a concern for you, but we should consider them when discussing this issue, otherwise we are afraid that it will mislead young people in general.</p>

<p>And Expand the Number of Members</p>
<p>Extending the Recruitment Deadline</p>
<p>The Chinese Platoon of the International Merchant Corps has decided to open classes for the current batch of reservists on October 15th to gradually impart various drills and marksmanship, increase the military knowledge of Chinese merchants, and cultivate martial talents. Although the Shanghai Merchant Corps serves only a corner of the concession, the Chinese platoon, as part of the international corps, participates in drills and marksmanship courses that are comparable to those of various nationalities. If we do not improve ourselves, how can we allow foreigners to recognize the truth about our nation and be awed and admire us? Therefore, the platoon must take this preparatory training seriously so that they can gain in-depth knowledge. At the same time, the platoon will expand the number of recruits and extend the recruitment deadline. As a result, Chinese merchants in Shanghai who are fond of martial arts have been enthusiastically filling out application forms and registering at 2B Jiujiang Road in recent days.</p>

<p>Mooncakes Suffer</p>
<p>A No. 15089 public bus traveling between Jing'an Temple Road and Bazichang, at about 4:20 PM yesterday, traveling east-to-west on Nanjing Road at the intersection of Henan Road, crashed when a rickshaw suddenly appeared in front of it, obstructing its path. The driver tried to make way for it, but it was too late, and in a rush, the bus crashed into the glass on the left side of the Lihua Company's store at No. 165 Nanjing Road. The rickshaw was damaged and broken, and the public bus driver was also injured. The force of the impact was strong enough that the bus head actually touched the electric pole on the side of the road, but the driver braked in time and prevented a major disaster. The glass of the Lihua Company's window was completely shattered, and the items displayed inside were all mooncakes. It is reported that the losses were minor.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Haikong dredging vessel of the Shanghai Harbour Bureau, which was sunk in the Huangpu River by a German ship the other day, is now being salvaged. The ship has capsized at the bottom of the river and must first be turned over before it can be lifted. Although the construction is extremely difficult, it should be possible to turn it over within days, and it is expected that it can be completely salvaged soon. Furthermore, the Jiangyuan gunboat, which had an accident near Xiamen on the 8th of this month, has already sunk into deep water, and salvage is also very difficult, but it is expected that it can be recovered within two weeks. As for the German ship Bukelan, which ran aground on the coast of Korea on the 6th of this month, after being slightly repaired after the danger, it set sail on its own to Japan today (the 19th) and entered the Mitsui Shipyard for repairs.</p>

<p>Fang Xueting Fined Five Dollars</p>
<p>Fang Xueting (also known as Fang Meisheng, nicknamed "Little Fang"), a translator in the fingerprint division of the French Concession Police Department, was recently accused of extortion and intimidation by Liu Bingheng, a graduate of the French Political and Legal University, at the Lao Zha Police Station. Detective Feng Xiushan arrested Fang at the Da Dong Ballroom at 9:30 PM the night before last. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court's Criminal First Division, where presiding Judge Xu Jiashi questioned him. Lawyer Ru Bao Yi, representing the police, stated that the defendant was taking advantage of the authority of the police department, and no one dared to oppose him. He and the plaintiff, Liu Bingheng, were friends. On the 15th of this month, Liu stayed in Room 424 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel, and Fang also booked Room 430 in the same hotel. At 2 AM on the morning of the 16th, Fang ordered a tea boy to call Liu to his room and said that he had a friend who wanted to borrow 50 yuan from him, but he did not have the money on hand, so he asked Liu to lend him 50 yuan. Liu only had 10 yuan on him, so he paid that amount. Fang then ordered Liu to raise the remaining 40 yuan and give it to him the next day, and then they parted ways. Last night, Liu was dancing at the Xin Xin Ballroom when he met Fang. Fang immediately demanded the remaining 40 yuan, but Liu refused to give it. Fang then punched Liu, and they were separated by others. Liu then reported to the police, who ordered a detective to arrest him. The police are now prosecuting him for extortion and intimidation under Article 370 of the Criminal Law. However, the defendant, Fang Xueting, is a civil servant and should be severely punished for this behavior. Liu Bingheng then stated that he had been friends with the defendant for nearly a year, and the defendant had often borrowed money from him, and he was afraid of his power and dared not refuse. He has considerable power in the ballroom and is known as a "ballroom tycoon." Therefore, after he beat me at Xin Xin last night, no dancers dared to come out and testify. Today, only Sun Junsheng and Zhao Linlin came to court to testify. Sun Junsheng then stated that he was a classmate of the plaintiff and had seen the defendant beat the plaintiff, but he did not know about the extortion. Zhao Linlin then stated that she was a dancer at the Da Hu Ballroom and had seen "Little Fang" beat the plaintiff yesterday. Although she had heard about the extortion, she could not prove it for sure. The defendant denied everything and stated that Zhao Linlin and the plaintiff were very close, as everyone knew. Zhao also often went to the plaintiff's place. This time, he was falsely accused. Lawyer Fan Gang defended the defendant, stating that the case was actually caused by jealousy and that there was no evidence of extortion. He requested that the defendant be declared innocent. Finally, Prosecutor Qian Hongye said that the case of extortion could not be established. The defendant had beaten the plaintiff, so he could only be charged with violating public order. Judge Xu ruled that Fang Xueting was not guilty of the criminal charges and fined him five yuan for violating public order.</p>

<p>The Deceased Were Said to Be the Concubine of a Pawnshop Owner and a Maid</p>
<p>Both Corpses Were Decayed and Smelly, as if They Had Been Dead for More Than a Day</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5 PM, two female corpses were discovered in a room on the second floor of Yichang Electrical Appliance Shop at No. 196 Dongxi Huade Road, causing a commotion among the surrounding neighbors. It was said that the deceased were a mistress and a servant. One corpse was on the bed, and the other was in the closet. They were decayed and smelled bad, as if they had been dead for more than a day. One story is that the mistress was the concubine of Zhu, the owner of the Hongyu pawnshop at the intersection of Dongxi Huade Road and Huaji Road. Zhu himself had gone to visit relatives in Wuxi with his wife a few days ago. The other deceased was a maid. There was also a child in the room, about two years old. It was said that around 5 PM yesterday, this child repeatedly knocked on the glass window along the street, which was discovered by a shop assistant across the street. Feeling strange, the shop assistant reported it to the police, who discovered the two female corpses. Both had injuries on their bodies. The third floor of No. 196 is occupied by a Russian.</p>

<p>And Is Severely Addicted to Opium</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that a Portuguese man named Langeer was arrested at No. 26 Nanxun Road by the Huishi Police based on a confession from a suspect in the Baidun Road case. Yesterday afternoon, he was taken to the Portuguese Consulate Court. He was interrogated by the Portuguese Consul for armed robbery. The judge declared that the preliminary trial was established and remanded him for further trial. Because the defendant was addicted to opium, the medical officer was instructed to monitor him at all times. Currently, Langeer is only accused of involvement in the case of silver, money, clothes, and jewelry worth 770 yuan stolen at No. 62 Xinzha Road on the 6th of this month. According to the victim's report, a Westerner was seen keeping watch nearby at the time. It is still under investigation whether Langeer is related to the Baidun Road case on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Penalty of Three Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Bai Yufa, a Shandong native and driver No. 164 of the French Tram Company, was driving tram No. 41 on Route 1 from the Sixteen Pu to the Rue Massenet at 6:00 PM on the 29th of last month. When passing the Old North Gate Avenue on the Avenue Edward VII, Zhu Liheng, a carpenter from Tongzhou working at Dunlop Rubber, accidentally dropped a copper coin from his pocket while crossing the tracks. As he bent down to pick it up, Bai failed to stop in time and knocked Zhu down, causing a head injury. He was arrested, his number recorded, and Zhu was taken to the police station and then transferred to the Renji Hospital. Due to the severity of the injury, Zhu died the next day. The body was reported to the court, which confirmed the cause of death for burial. The defendant was escorted to the Second Special District Court by the police station. After questioning by Judge Xiong, Wang, the wife of the deceased, arrived from her hometown and appointed lawyer Wang Shizong as her representative to file a private lawsuit to seek compensation for the loss. Defendant Bai Yufa and the tram company were represented by lawyer Ba He. The defendant was ordered to post bail, and the hearing was adjourned. The private lawsuit was settled out of court. Yesterday, another summons was issued. According to the lawyer representing the deceased's family, the private lawsuit had been settled out of court, and a request was made to withdraw the case. Defendant Ba He stated that the private lawsuit had been resolved through compensation by the company. As for the public prosecution, the driver had no major negligence and requested leniency. After questioning the deceased's wife, Zhu Wang, and the defendant Bai Yufa, Judge Xiong made a judgment in court: the defendant was found guilty of causing death through negligence in the course of his work and was fined three hundred yuan, to be paid within one month. If forcibly executed and not paid in full, two yuan of the fine would be converted into one day of imprisonment. The defendant remained on his original bail.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Mediation in Western Restaurant Labor Dispute <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Terms are Resolvable, Resumption of Work Problematic</p>
<p>Seventy+ Unions Throughout the City Provide Assistance</p>
<p>After the Western restaurant industry in the city refused to reinstate the workers who went on strike, the entire industry immediately hired new workers, and business has fully recovered. The industry insists on not rehiring the striking workers, and the workers' lives are indeed worrying. The Social Bureau has repeatedly mediated, and most of the treatment conditions are resolvable. The problem of resuming work has become the most important issue in this case. Mediation will be held again tomorrow. More than seventy unions throughout the city have risen to assist. The details of the various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Mediation: At 1:00 PM yesterday, the City Social Bureau convened the Labor-Management Mediation Committee again to mediate the treatment conditions of the Western restaurant industry. Zhong Quan from the City Party Department, Lin Zhenchuan and Wu Furen from the Western Restaurant Industry Association, Wu Shenxiang and Zhao Jinghua from the Western Restaurant Workers' Union, and Qiu Peihao, a staff member of the Social Bureau, attended as chairman. After a long discussion, the first item (small accounts), the second item (extra bonus money), the fifth item (apprentices), the sixth item (dismissal), and the seventh item (Western chefs) have all been resolved. However, the third item (subsidies), the fourth item (double pay), and the issue of reinstating all the striking workers have not yet been resolved. It is scheduled to continue the mediation tomorrow at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Party and Government Instructions: Li Zuoheng, a standing director of the Western Chef Industry Union, was arrested for official business. After the court sentenced him to six months' imprisonment, the union requested bail from the Party and government agencies. Yesterday, the City Party Department issued instructions: "The presentation that comrade Li Zuoheng was framed by the capitalist's conspiracy and requesting approval for relief has been received. It has been learned that this committee has already sent a letter to the court to handle the matter with leniency. The request should not be discussed." This is the instruction. In addition, the Social Bureau issued instructions: "The presentation has been received. Since it is said that the court has already made a preliminary judgment, if there is any dissatisfaction, there is no other remedy than to appeal according to the law and await a decision. The request should not be discussed." This is the instruction.</p>
<p>Union Assistance: All workers in the Western restaurant industry, in order to demand improved treatment, put forward seven conditions. In view of the lack of sincerity of the capitalists to negotiate, they went on strike on their own on August 13th. For the sake of assistance, Western chef workers joined the strike. More than a month has passed, and it has not yet been resolved. More than seventy unions in the city, including the publishing, water and electricity, and cigarette industries, held discussions on assistance matters in the publishing industry union the day before yesterday. It was decided to appoint representatives such as Hou Dachun and Chen Peide to go to the Social Bureau and request that they quickly find a way to mediate.</p>
<h3 id="e107">British Public Bus Workers to Petition the City Government Tomorrow <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Request for Relief Measures</p>
<p>Company Attitude is Strong</p>
<p>After the British Public Bus workers went on strike again, the company refused to reinstate them unconditionally, and the Social Bureau rejected the request. As a result, the workers' lives are worrying. More than seventy unions throughout the city have risen to assist. The workers have decided to petition the city government tomorrow, requesting relief and again appealing to the Chinese directors to mediate. The details of the various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Committee Meeting: The British Public Bus Request for Resumption of Work Committee held a meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Hong Mingdao reported on the process of requesting resumption of work. Then, a discussion began. It was resolved: (1) To petition the city government on the 21st, requesting relief to avoid unemployment for all workers; (2) To ask union representatives Hou Dachun and Chen Peide to go to the Social Bureau and request the revocation of instruction No. 14875 and to find a way to mediate again; (3) To appoint staff from various departments; (4) To send representatives to appeal to the Chinese directors to mediate again.</p>
<p>Company Strength: The British Public Bus Company, after a board of directors resolution, refused to reinstate the workers unconditionally, set a deadline for handing over uniforms, otherwise it would pursue the guarantors of each worker. More than 100 of the newly hired workers have passed the review and examination. From the day before yesterday, all the British Concession buses, except for routes 3 and 6, have fully returned to their original state. According to the company, the strike by all ticket sellers has long been resolved. The procedures are also clear. The company will not recognize any further requests for resumption of work. Therefore, the livelihood of the striking workers is indeed worrying.</p>
<p>Union Assistance: More than seventy unions in the city, including postal, water and electricity, publishing, cigarette, and pharmacy unions, sent Li Yongxiang, Zhao Shusheng, Lu Muqin, and others to comfort all the striking British Public Bus workers at 9:00 AM yesterday. They also proceeded to find ways to assist. All the striking workers held a welcome meeting at 10:00 AM. The representatives all gave speeches and guided all the methods to be carried out.

<h3 id="e108">Business Tax Reporting and Calculation Methods <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Various Industry Tax Rules Committees Write to Request Explanation</p>
<p>The Tax Rules Research Committee of various industry trade associations in the city sent a letter to the Business Tax Collection Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday requesting an explanation of the business tax reporting procedures and calculation methods. The letter stated, "Regarding business tax in this city, implementation is imminent, but detailed handling is always welcome. We urgently need to request explanations on the following points, which are enumerated below: (1) Article 2 of the Implementing Rules of the Business Tax Regulations in this city states that those who meet the requirements for collecting business tax should apply for a business tax investigation certificate. According to the meaning of the provisions, those who do not meet the tax requirements can naturally not apply for a business tax investigation certificate. The clear statement in your office's reply to the City Chamber of Commerce approving the postponement of the grain store industry's application for an investigation certificate further leaves no doubt. However, in addition to the grain store industry, there are other tax-exempt businesses in the city, such as the tap water industry, the water sales industry, the garment industry, the lace embroidery industry, and the restaurant industry that is located near schools and specializes in selling student meals. Those that have been revised and deleted include the car rental industry, the contracted meal industry, and various industries that have already paid property tax, deed tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes that are the same as business tax. None of these meet the tax requirements and naturally do not need to apply for a business tax investigation certificate. This is the first point for your instructions. (2) Article 2 of the Business Tax Law and Article 20 of the Business Tax Regulations of this city both state that the brokerage industry will temporarily be taxed at the old tax rate. However, the brokerage industry in this city is located in the Chinese area and has all received brokerage licenses. Changing to business tax is certainly difficult. Those established in the concession area may not all have brokerage licenses, so the tax rate will be impossible to calculate. If the standard for taxation is based on their business turnover, then the very meager commissions they receive will not be enough to pay the taxes. It is only fair and in line with the principle of business tax emphasizing revenue to base the taxation on the commission amount. Moreover, according to the business tax rate in this city, the auction industry has already set a precedent for taxing based on the commission amount, which seems to be feasible. This is the second point for your instructions. (3) Items 6 and 8 of the business registration form in this city have estimated annual business income. The so-called estimate is the amount of business expected at the beginning of the year. The business of stores has its ups and downs, and it is difficult to make an accurate estimate. However, ordinary stores are not so different unless they encounter special changes, while the construction industry is very different. Some have last year's business turnover of millions of yuan, while this year there is no business income at all. Some have no business income last year, while this year's business turnover is millions of yuan. The degree of difference is tenfold or a hundredfold. If the estimate is too high, it will frequently increase the extra burden. If the estimate is too low, it may affect the government's tax revenue, which is not a good strategy for both parties. Moreover, the construction of contracted buildings often takes several years to complete. It is also difficult to calculate the tax on the result of a business tax once a year. Recently, the industry has repeatedly reported the difficult situation in person and intends to treat the contracting of a building as setting up a branch store, applying for a business tax investigation certificate and hanging it at the location of the building, and paying business tax according to the contract amount. In this way, both the taxpayer and the tax collector will be fair, and the difficulty of calculating taxes will be easily solved. The Association observes that the situation is real. In order to take into account both facts and laws, there is no other way to seek it. This is the third point for your instructions. (4) Article 9 of the Business Tax Regulations of this city states that manufacturers who sell their manufactured products directly at their manufacturing sites will still be taxed at the tax rate prescribed for the manufacturing industry. Does the so-called manufacturing site only refer to the factory site, or does it refer to the city area? If it is limited to the factory site, the burden on manufacturers seems to be too heavy, which is contrary to the national government's purpose of supporting enterprises. This is the fourth point for your instructions. Regarding the above points, we respectfully request that your office reply to each one for guidance."</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I have read in the news column of your newspaper on the 19th that Shen Aizhen, a piano teacher at Moore Memorial Church, committed suicide. After investigation, there is no such person as Shen Aizhen among the piano teachers in our church, and her name is not even found in the student register. I believe it is a mistake in your newspaper's reporting. I am afraid of misunderstandings from the outside world, so I specially request a correction. Sincerely, Moore Memorial Church.</p>

<p>The men's doubles tennis final saw Yu Tianguang and Liu Keng defeat Wang Minqin and Sun Chengbi with a score of 3-1. The performance of both sides lacked brilliance, with many errors, making it a rather ordinary match. The referee was Tang Zhongguang.</p>

<p>Match Details</p>
<p>First set: The competition was fierce, with the scores very close. At 4-4, Yu and Liu gained another game to lead 5-4. However, they then lost three consecutive games, ultimately losing the set 5-7. In this set, Liu Keng made many errors, hitting the net frequently, and Yu Tianguang was also not performing strongly. The loss was entirely due to self-inflicted errors. Wang and Sun, particularly Sun Chengbi, played powerfully, with frequent smashes, leading to Yu and Liu's initial defeat.</p>
<p>Second set: Yu and Liu took the lead at 5-4, but Wang and Sun won back two games, making it 5-6. Yu and Liu also won two games, making it 7-6. At this crucial juncture, the outcome was still uncertain. After 7-7, Yu and Liu fought bravely to win 9-7. In this set, Yu Tianguang gradually improved, hitting with force, and Sun Chengbi's smashes also frequently hit the net.</p>
<p>Last two sets: To maintain their lead, Yu and Liu played with extraordinary caution. The opponents also wanted to regain the victory. As a result, in the doubles match, Yu and Wang were seen exchanging long baseline shots, while Liu and Sun watched from the sidelines, or Yu and Sun traded long shots, with neither daring to approach the net. This was a rare sight. In the final two sets, Yu and Liu gradually rallied, while Wang Minshi was poor at running and dealing with backhand shots, making it difficult to cope. Sun Chengbi was less steady than in the first two sets. Consequently, Yu and Liu won with scores of 6-2 and 6-4.</p>

<p>Championship Winning Situation</p>
<p>| Turning Point of the Second Set |</p>
<p>In the first set, Yang took a 4-2 lead, but Xiang won back two games to tie the score at 4-4. Yang then won two more games to win the set. Yang's victory came with ease, with excellent forehand and backhand shots, making her likely to win. In the second set, Yang again took a 4-1 lead, with Xiang only winning the second game. Although Xiang fought to 3-4, Yang surged ahead again, needing just one more game to win the championship. However, the opposite happened. Yang's performance declined sharply from then on. Since she was not good at running, she gave up on many balls. Xiang's momentum became fierce, and many balls hit Yang's racket but could not be returned. Xiang won four consecutive games, completely reversing the situation and rising to prominence. In the deciding third set, Xiang won three consecutive games, then took a 4-1 lead, reversing the downward trend of the first set. Yang had too many weak shots and errors. Although she fought hard to save the situation, Xiang ultimately won the third set 6-4 and the championship 2-1. Xiang's victory was entirely due to brute force, while Yang lost due to carelessness. Both players still need to further develop their skills, as their variations were not diverse.</p>

<p>Superior Throughout, Fighting Spirit High</p>
<p>| Jinan Wins 5-1 |</p>
<p>Jinan Football has dominated Shanghai for years. The team viewed this Shanghai Municipal Football Championship as being in their grasp. Their only formidable rival was the Youyou team. Since the start of the competition, Jinan and Youyou had been like two dragons entering the sea, thrashing and struggling forward amidst towering waves. By yesterday, the time was ripe for them to seize the pearl. The twenty-two heroes from both sides lined up at the China baseball field. Under the refereeing of He Chunhui, they battled for ninety minutes. Jinan displayed overwhelming momentum and achieved their wish, winning the championship with a score of five to one. Youyou fought throughout, with high morale. Regardless of victory or defeat, they were commendable.</p>
<p>(1) The Journey of the Heroes to Seize the Championship</p>
<p>(2) Each Had Its Merits</p>
<p>Jinan Has Balanced Talent: The athletes of Jinan were tall, and their skills in tackling, snatching, and shooting were all agile and swift. The focus of their victory was here. However, their actions were also rough, which was inevitable. Jiang Shanjing's defense of the last line was a great achievement. He was steady and tough, and had few lapses, showing even more progress than before. The three players in the center defense line were excellent, and there was nothing to add. The five forwards formed a line, and their advance and retreat were well-ordered. Luo Haiguang and Qiu Dongyan were the pillars of this formation, making many contributions. The roster is as follows:</p>
<p>Jiang Zongmian Huang Huanchang (Down) Zhang Gancai (Up) Jiang Shanjing Liang Shutang Zhuang Shihong Chen Fuzhong Fu Hexuan Qiu Dongyan Luo Haiguang Yang Baomiao Chen Zhenxiang</p>
<p>Youyou's High Spirits Were Inspiring: Youyou had many good players. Tu Kaiyuan, in the central defender position, was agile and skilled, and was one of the best in Shanghai, but he was ultimately unable to turn the tide alone. Mao Honggui's close marking of Qiu Dongyan was extremely effective. Goalkeeper Tang Ruchun's saves were excellent. Had it been someone else, the team would have conceded more than five goals. Veteran Rao Huisheng still displayed his old skills and power, shocking many past famous players. Dong Shaopei's absence due to a leg injury was a major factor in their defeat. The whole team fought consistently from beginning to end, earning the approval of the entire stadium. The lineup is recorded below:</p>
<p>Tang Yongchun Rao Huisheng Jin Shimin (Up) Lu Yongxi Shen Bogui (Down) He Borong (Up) Tu Kaiyuan Mao Honggui Shen Baochang Hu Youcheng Wang Caigao Wang Zhangbao Up Jin Shimin Down Shi Jinsheng</p>
<h3 id="e133">(3) The Battle Was Intense <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Struggling After Losing Momentum: Unfortunately for Youyou, they suffered a blow at the start of the match. Within three minutes, the Jinan army arrived at the front line. Within five steps, a goal was scored by center forward Luo Haiguang, which seemed unexpected. Youyou reorganized their formation and tried to resist. Jiang Shanjing missed a tackle, and the opponent took the opportunity to attack directly. The goalkeeper made a flying save just in time. Youyou's second incursion was unsuccessful. Mao Honggui delivered a well-placed pass, and the center made a rush, creating a very dangerous situation, but it was turned into safety. Thanks to the goalkeeper's efforts, Jinan repeatedly attacked, but they were always blocked by the triangular formation of Tu, Mao, and Rao. However, there were many loopholes on the left wing, and the enemy frequently entered through this area. After twenty minutes, the left forward of He failed to notice that Jinan's Chen Zhenxiang took the opportunity to make a pass, which Qiu Dongyan caught up with and scored, making it 2-0. Five minutes later, Jinan took advantage of the chaos within the enemy's camp, and Qiu scored another goal. In the last ten minutes, Youyou rallied and besieged the enemy's goal. Mao Hong kicked a free kick, which went into the net. The first half ended 3-1.</p>
<p>Adding Fuel to the Fire, Securing Victory: From the start of the second half, Youyou was under greater pressure, and the entire army retreated to defend. However, Jinan's attacks were ineffective, and they could not find an opening. Therefore, they changed their strategy and focused on both wings. Youyou split their forces to defend, leaving the center vulnerable. Fu Hexuan made a pass, and Luo Haiguang scored on a ground shot, making it 4-1. Youyou's forwards were active, attacking the enemy goal directly. The goalkeeper saved it from danger, but the ball rebounded, and Luo and Fu entered an unguarded area, side by side. The goalkeeper was bold and careful, and the ball hit his body, ensuring safety. Youyou's momentum suddenly increased, and Wang Caigao made a header that almost broke into the net. Fortunately, Fu Hexuan arrived in time and saved it with a back kick. In the end, Yang Baosen fouled and was sent off. Luo Haiguang...</p>

<p>47 Men's Track and Field Athletes</p>
<p>Absent After Receiving Medals</p>
<p>Because there was no registration fee for the city-wide sports meeting, many went to register and dared to take the athlete's medal, but did not join the sports. It has now been found that as many as 47 people are missing from the men's track and field event. Among them, there are indeed those who cannot participate in the sport due to special circumstances, such as Wen Dingxin and Zhou Ende, but most of them can be said to be people who have taken medals for their own sake. It is hoped that all groups and schools will pay attention to this in the future and never allow this bad spirit to exist. The names of those who are absent, the events they joined at the time, and their addresses are recorded below:</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Employees' Health Sports event held its basketball and soccer semi-finals yesterday morning at the Municipal No. 1 Sports Ground, and the track and field preliminaries in the afternoon at the China Track and Field Ground. The weather was overcast, with a light autumn breeze, suitable for the participants. The athletes were in high spirits, and many spectators came to watch, creating a joyful atmosphere. The competition results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Basketball Semi-finals</p>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs Defeats Bureau of Public Works 36-6</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works was short of skilled players, with one or two members barely making up the numbers. Their combat strength was naturally weaker. The Bureau of Social Affairs, on the other hand, had a well-trained team with rich experience. Therefore, the strength difference between the two teams was quite significant. The outcome was predictable. However, the spirit of the athletes was consistent throughout. Even the Bureau of Public Works fought to the end, which was commendable. The referee was Ni Shiming.</p>
<p>Soccer Semi-finals</p>
<p>(1) Bureau of Land Defeats Public Security Bureau 5-1</p>
<p>(2) Bureau of Social Affairs Defeats Bureau of Education 5-0</p>
<p>Both the Bureau of Land and the Public Security Bureau were well-tested teams with their own abilities. However, when they met, the Public Security Bureau fought hard, and the forwards of the Bureau of Land were nimble and good at sprinting. Within ten minutes, they launched a joint attack and opened the scoring. Soon after the restart, they again deployed their iron cavalry and scored another goal from the center forward. The Public Security Bureau suffered repeated setbacks, and their momentum was strong, but their shooting was inaccurate. It was a pity that they missed by a hair's breadth. The Bureau of Land, on the other hand, launched side attacks and secret crossings, using countless tricks and adding three more goals, winning 5-1. The Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Education had unequal strength. Lu Jicang and Niu Yinchu of the Bureau of Social Affairs were former star players of Jiaotong University, and the rest of the team were also strong. The Bureau of Education had a more balanced team, but there were no outstanding players, so they were defeated. The referees for both matches were Zhang Longhai.</p>

<p>On the track and field, the Bureau of Land had the strongest momentum. They had already won seven points in the high jump final. They also occupied more than half of the spots in the 100-meter and 200-meter preliminary and semi-final rounds. The athletes of the bureau were all wearing red vests. After the sprint races started, the spectators cheered "Red Vests!" endlessly. Among them, Xue Jianqiu's results in the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter races were all promising for first place. Hu Hongji, the director of the Bureau of Health, also joined the 400-meter preliminary race. Although he did not qualify for the final, he reached the finish line with great spirit.</p>

<p>| Results: 4-1 Victory for Hui-Ka Group |</p>
<p>Today's Lin-Qiu vs. Hui-Ka Final</p>
<p>| Held at the Original Venue at 3:00 PM |</p>
<p>The Shanghai Open Doubles Semi-Finals took place at the French Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. There were two groups in total: Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai defeated Matsunaga and Oka 3-0, and Whittaker and Naffal defeated De-Fu and Bu-Tuo 3-1.</p>
<p>Straight Sets Victory for Lin-Qiu</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Qiu Feihai 6-0 6-1 6-4 Matsunaga Oka</p>
<p>Lin-Qiu's victory was expected, and the straight sets win was not a surprise. The Japanese team was completely defeated in the first set. They won one game in the second set, avoiding a "duck egg". Lin-Qiu seemed careless in the third set, although the overall situation was unaffected, they lost their fighting spirit.</p>
<p>De-Buo's 1-3 Mistake</p>
<p>Whittaker Qiu Folo 3-6 6-3 6-0 8-6 De-Fu Buo Tuo</p>
<p>The situation on both sides was tense, with the fourth set having endless ups and downs. Victory belonged to De-Fu and Bu-Tuo in the first set. The situation reversed in the second set, with Whittaker and Qiu Folo celebrating successive victories. After easily winning the second and third sets, they successfully won the fourth set, which was commendable.</p>
<p>Today Lin-Qiu Show their Skills</p>
<p>Today at 3:00 PM, Lin-Qiu and Hui-Ka will hold the finals at the original venue. Lin-Qiu has higher skills, and winning the championship seems to be not difficult. However, Hui-Ka are experienced, and a fierce battle is expected.</p>

<p>Brief Competition Review</p>
<p>100-meter Freestyle Final: Yin Yanjun and Lian Xiannan competed fiercely, very tense. Towards the end, Yin showed fatigue due to having swam extensively in the 400-meter preliminary round, and was overtaken by Lian by a distance of eight meters, thus placing second.</p>
<p>100-meter Backstroke Preliminary: Both groups saw the first-place winner overtaking the initial leader in the final twenty meters. Such a coincidence is truly rare.</p>
<p>Women's 50-meter Backstroke Final: Only Ms. Liu Mali participated, highlighting the lack of female swimming talent in China.</p>
<p>200-meter Breaststroke Preliminary: There were three groups. Fu Kaixian from Zhonggong won the first group, but his excessive speed resulted in less forward progress, so his time was far slower than Ling Chongju in the second group. Ling's slower but more powerful movements represent the best style in the breaststroke. Zhong Langxuan from Jiaotong won the third group. Zhong is only seventeen, a handsome young man. If he practices harder, he will surely become a valuable talent in the future.</p>
<p>1500-meter Freestyle Preliminary: Divided into two groups. Zheng Guizhang's time in the first group was the best, breaking the previous record, but still far from the national record (25 minutes 3 seconds, held by Huang Maoyuan). Hopefully Zheng will continue to work hard.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Living Husband (Part 1) <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Among insects, praying mantises, spiders, scorpions, and others eat their husbands alive, with the praying mantis being the most brutal. French entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre (born 1823, died 1915) observed the love life of the praying mantis (Mantis) as follows:</p>
<p>"Observe their mating. To avoid disturbances from the crowd, we let them live in pairs. Each married couple has a small home, with no idlers disturbing their honeymoon. Plenty of food is also prepared, so they can eat whatever they want, without any hunger.</p>
<p>"It's nearly the end of August. The male praying mantis, a slender lover, believes the time is ripe and aims at his partner. He bends his neck, thrusts out his chest, and his small, pointed face expresses ardent emotion. He stares at his intended without moving, as if she is showing indifference. The male receives this tacit hint (I truly do not know the mystery within) and approaches her, suddenly spreads his wings, and his whole body trembles. This is probably a proposal. Though his body is small, he rushes onto his plump wife's back and holds on firmly. They prepare for a long time before finally mating, and the mating process can sometimes last five or six hours.</p>
<p>"This motionless couple is worth noting. They separate for a moment and then re-engage, even more intimately than before. The lady loves her poor husband not only because he can fertilize her ovaries but also because his flesh suits her taste. Sooner or later, she will catch her husband, bite off his head as usual, and eat it carefully. Everything but the wings will be eaten clean by her."</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Lindbergh Couple's Flight to China <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>– Mo Yi</p>
<p>The American aviator Lindbergh and his wife set off from the United States on July 28 to travel to the Far East. They will be in Japan for nearly a month. According to reports, they will first fly to China on the 19th, directly to Nanjing. At that time, the warm welcome from all sectors of the capital will give this world-famous aviator a new impression. Recently, Western newspapers carried anecdotes about the Lindbergh couple and rumors that they would not come to Shanghai. Here is a translated excerpt:</p>
<p>Not Coming to Shanghai: Last Wednesday, Lindbergh contacted the Shanghai Wan Geng Petroleum Company to request that they prepare twenty gallons of gasoline each in Tianjin and Nanjing between the 14th and 19th for his use. He did not mention whether he would come to Shanghai. The US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Cunningham, found this strange and telegraphed Lindbergh, but has received no reply. The reason is unknown. According to several aviators in Shanghai who are familiar with Lindbergh, "We may have the opportunity to see the Lindbergh couple, but to avoid the warm welcome and unnecessary socializing in Shanghai, they may come to Shanghai quietly, thus creating this mystery."</p>
<p>Indifferent to Fame and Fortune: Those in Shanghai who know Lindbergh well say that he has changed his nature somewhat since becoming famous. He sees others making meaningless flattery towards him, and treats even close friends with disdain. Even presidents and emperors are the same. At that time, countless beauties were attracted to him, and millions of gold were readily available, but he discarded them like worn-out shoes and was not moved in the slightest. As a result, his fame grew, and more people respected him, which only increased his aversion. He believes that the most unfortunate thing was that the President of the United States and the Prince of Wales bestowed honors and positions upon him, forcing him to fly back to Central America to escape. When he returned, he often disguised himself when going out; otherwise, he would face the dilemma of being unable to move freely in New York City. He once wore a tattered hat pulled down to his eyebrows and dark glasses on his nose, accompanying his wife to the theater to watch a play. However, he was recognized, and the audience shifted their attention from the play to the couple. Lindbergh was embarrassed and fled without waiting for the curtain to close.</p>
<p>Sweet Times: After Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, he received a warm welcome from people in the United States and France. Among them was a woman named Annie Morrow, who was particularly attracted to him and once proclaimed herself as the future Mrs. Lindbergh. Lindbergh initially had no fame. Once he became famous, countless women worshipped him as an idol. In 1929, he flew to Mexico and met Miss Annie Morrow, daughter of the former US Ambassador to Mexico, Mr. Morrow. They fell in love and married on May 27 at the Morrow family's villa in Englewood, New Jersey. To avoid newspaper reporters, the wedding was extremely secret, and no one knew about it. Miss Morrow had her wish fulfilled, and the lovers became a family. The joy of their marital chamber must be even greater than the joy of painting eyebrows.</p>
<p>The Birth of Little Lindbergh: Lindbergh's son was born last year. Newspaper offices competed with each other, using great effort to obtain photos of Little Lindbergh and publish them in the newspapers. Lindbergh's feelings towards newspaper reporters have always been incompatible, so he is both praised and criticized. Those who criticize him often exaggerate, straying far from the facts. However, Lindbergh does not bother to correct them, because facts are facts, and any malicious criticism is not worth the attention of those who know.</p>

<p>A pair of old leather shoes can be recycled. A middle-aged woman cannot inspire ardent love in a young man.</p>
<p>Those who like to comment on people's beauty are probably not beautiful themselves. Those who like to discuss people's shortcomings are probably not outstanding themselves.</p>
<p>In the past, secrecy was emphasized in love between the sexes. Now, openness is emphasized. Secrecy and openness have resulted in many heartbroken young men and women in modern times.</p>
<p>Frivolous youths see school as a prison. Romantic women see the family as a temporary lodging.</p>
<p>Seeking physical love with prostitutes is like exercising after a full meal; the harm is extreme.</p>
<p>Cats and dogs without intelligence cannot be loved by humans. How can women without beauty attract men?</p>
<p>Men are not necessarily attracted to women, but a woman's entire being contains colors that attract men. (Xu Xiaoting)</p>

<p>On the Beijing-Shanghai line, the coming and going of important people is very frequent. Every Saturday, the 9:30 AM express train will have empty flower cars and sleeping cars attached, waiting for use in Beijing. The flower cars used by various important people are mostly designated. Mr. Song Ziwen uses M2, and Chairman Chiang uses PC105. No one is allowed to borrow them on weekdays. Chairman Chiang's flower car is divided into four parts: a reception room, a bedroom, a bathroom, and a servant's bedroom. It is equipped with many sofas, exquisite murals on the walls, deeply hidden embroidered curtains, and bright lights. It is no different from a first-class hotel. Because the chairman does not come to Shanghai often, the car remains at the station almost all year round, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>The railway staff's method of donating salaries for disaster relief has been recorded in this publication. Now, because this method conflicts with the one promulgated by the central government, it has been modified. However, employees with a monthly salary of less than one hundred yuan should still make their own donations separately, solicited by the section chiefs. In the past day or two, the number has been quite considerable. Even track workers and stokers who earn only ten or so yuan a month are enthusiastically contributing, with a minimum of one yuan and a maximum of ten or twenty yuan. It can be said that they are acting bravely and righteously.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Ransheng, the former chief of the railway, served for more than thirty years. Unfortunately, he was dismissed during Director Cai's tenure. Now, Director Guo has reported to the Ministry of Railways and approved his return, appointing him as the chief of both railways. On the day he took office, the workers pooled their money to buy over a thousand firecrackers. At 7:00 AM, they waited for Mr. Zhang to arrive at the bureau and set off the firecrackers everywhere, the sound reverberating through the sky and the cheers echoing. Mr. Zhang was deeply touched by this.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Yangtze River has risen again. The Nanjing riverside station has been submerged by the raging waves, and the tracks are no longer visible. The platform is also in imminent danger. The stationmaster, finding transportation difficult, intends to cancel the Jinpu Railway joint transportation. The head of the transportation department, Yuan Shaochang, believes that the joint transportation is related to the Shanghai market and has not yet approved it.</p>
<h3 id="e147">A Study of American Wheat Varieties <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yangnian</p>
<p>The severity of the flood in our country this time is rare in centuries. The issue of wheat varieties in the flood has been mentioned in previous reports. According to the opinion of Dr. Love of the United States, American wheat is not suitable for Chinese soil and climate. Planting American wheat by mistake would be unimaginable. We should quickly collect existing wheat varieties. In practice, we have found this to be quite untrue. Ten years ago, when I was in Shanghai, I received a peck of American white wheat from my old friend Mao Ziheng. I took it back to Jiangzhou, Zhenjiang, and the results of the trial planting for more than ten years have shown that the grains are round, the stems are thick, and the variety does not change at all. In the spring and summer, when walking leisurely in the fields, seeing the American wheat with thick stems, strong ears, and a shiny green color, it is very different from the thin and short Chinese wheat. Therefore, it is easy to tell that it is a good variety. The above situation of trial planting American wheat is based on personal experience and differs greatly from what Dr. Love of the United States said. I don't know what Dr. Love's basis for saying that is. In my opinion, American wheat is suitable for Chinese soil and there is no need to discuss it further. However, the most important thing to note is the planting time of American wheat, which must be ten days before the frost season, the earlier the better. Harvesting can only be done during the awn season of the following year. It is advisable to plant and harvest early. Otherwise, it will ripen six or seven days after the Chinese wheat is harvested. What is not as good as planting early rice is this point. The area of our country affected by the flood is very wide. In the future, after the flood recedes, the need for wheat varieties will be huge. In the highlands where the flood has receded first, American wheat can be tried. Improving wheat varieties in this way is not a bad plan to avoid importing foreign wheat every year, which leads to an increasingly unsustainable economy. It is hoped that the ruling giants and patriotic heroes will study this article carefully. I sincerely implore them.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Records of What I've Seen and Heard in the Old Capital <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>

<p>Fried Chestnuts</p>
<p>In various cities in the South today, around the Mid-Autumn Festival, fried chestnuts with sugar and sand are sold on the streets and alleys, labeled as "Liangxiang Chestnuts." Southerners are mostly vague about place names in the North. Only Liangxiang, with its fried chestnuts, has made an impression on everyone's minds. Liangxiang is the first county southwest of Beijing. The record of fried chestnuts in our country's history goes back thousands of years. According to the Qidan National Records, Xiao Han Jianu once said to the Liao Emperor, "I know how to fry chestnuts. If the small ones are cooked, the big ones will definitely be raw. If the big ones are cooked, the small ones will definitely be scorched." The Liao Dynasty used Yan as its southern capital. The Liao rulers must have been accustomed to the customs of Yanjing (Beijing), so Xiao Han Jianu used it as an analogy to make it easier for them to understand. Lao Xue An's Notes states, "Li He, who tossed chestnuts in the old capital, was famous in all directions. Others tried every means to imitate him, but they could never match him." His poem "Feeling About Eating Fried Chestnuts at Night in the Jiannan Collection" has a note saying, "Waiting for the morning court in a leaky house, officials often eat this." According to this, Bianjing (Kaifeng) also had this custom, and it was transmitted to Jiangbiao (Jiangnan) after the Southern Crossing. Then, such a small thing is related to the rise and fall of the world's fortune and the migration of culture over thousands of years. On a cold autumn night, next to a green lamp, buying a handful of this and eating it has a taste beyond taste, making one reflect on the past. In the Northern capital, fried chestnuts are followed by sweet potatoes. The roasted sweet potatoes are charred on the outside and cooked on the inside. Buying one and eating it while standing on the street can be a meal. The juice from the boiled sweet potatoes is thick and reddish in color and tastes especially rich. Whether rich or poor, everyone likes to eat them. Their fragrance is rich and mellow. Even wealthy people, passing by in a carriage, cannot help but smell it from afar and want to eat it.</p>
<p>Cat Calamity</p>
<p>It is said that the Persian cat is the best of all cat breeds. In our country, the Linqing lion cat is produced, which was valued by nobles in the past. The appearance of a lion cat is characterized by thick, shiny fur and the ability to sense human intentions. Every winter night, when warming oneself by the stove, having this creature curled up at one's feet is better than stroking jade-like skin. The North is bitterly cold, and short fur is not warm enough, so this breed is quite suitable. Its breed inheritance only appears every two or three generations. It is not necessarily true of every litter. Even in one litter, it only happens occasionally. My family's small calico cat produced one in its first litter. Its entire body was snow-white, except for half of its cheek and its tail, which were black. It was good at catching mice and also good at charming people. It was stroked all day long and never got annoyed. In the early spring of Bingyin year, it was sick for several days and did not eat. It was sent to the hospital, but the cause was unknown. It was thought that it could not be saved. Curling up by the stove, it suddenly got up and ate. Since then, it was able to recover. In the spring of Jiyi year, it suddenly disappeared. In recent years, the price of cat skin has been very high, worth several yuan per head. Greedy villains take advantage of the night to poison cats and lure them to their death. Families that raise cats hear about disappearances every day. After a long time, people gradually become aware. Although the police have also arrested and punished these people, no one can stop them where profit lies. There is no way to describe it other than calling it a cat calamity. Human nature is unkind and harms the innocent. Alas.</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>He took off the old gown he usually wore at home and put on a Western suit, preparing to visit some friends. However, the underarms of several Western suit jackets were torn and split. He sighed, opened the drawer, and looked for his wife's needle and thread, intending to mend them himself, but he couldn't find it. He had already taken out all the clothes he could wear this season and piled them on the bed, but they all had cracks. He resented his wife for being so irresponsible to her husband. The maid was from the countryside, and she couldn't sew this kind of clothes. He really had no choice, but he didn't want to go outside wearing torn clothes, so he could only abandon his plans to visit friends. He didn't bother to tidy up the clothes he had taken out, planning to let his wife see them when she got home in the evening, hoping she would feel bad and automatically mend them for him. He sat on the chair, sighing blankly, planning how to persuade his wife.</p>
<p>Mrs. Li suddenly walked in, holding a woman's photo in her hand. Her beautiful eyes were swollen and red, as she had been crying severely, with shiny tears still in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen! Look! This is a photo of a woman, the same woman who was in the car that night!" Mrs. Li handed the photo to Mr. Chen, panting and speaking with a sad tone.</p>
<p>"Really, it's a woman. Where did you get it?" Mr. Chen was also a little surprised.</p>
<p>"I got it from his pocket. Have you found out anything I asked you to investigate? You should help me."</p>
<p>"I don't dare to lie to you. I really haven't investigated it."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you go?"</p>
<p>"I don't have time during the day, and I'm too lazy to go out at night. Why don't you ask my wife to help you? She's been going to the movies with Mr. Li recently."</p>
<p>"Oh. Er is my close friend since childhood. In theory, she should help me, but I don't want to ask her. She's been too close to my husband recently, and she definitely won't investigate."</p>
<p>"Don't be discouraged. If you treat him so faithfully, he will surely realize it in the future. For now, try to be more tolerant and find less trouble for yourself, and it will be fine."</p>
<p>"You don't look good today. Are you feeling unwell? Oh! Why are there so many clothes piled on the bed?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing. I wanted to change clothes and go out, but I changed my mind at the last minute."</p>
<p>Mrs. Li began to tidy up the clothes one by one. Finally, she found the cracks. She went to get the needle and thread and mended each piece for him, hanging them back in the closet on hangers.</p>
