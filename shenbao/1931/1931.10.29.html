<h3 id="c33">闢日人所謂「滿蒙特殊權益」（三） <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>日人所謂依據於旣成條約獲得之特殊權益。昨評旣已檢討其成立之價</p>
<p>値矣。至於迄無條約根據。而事實上已在實行。如（一）安奉綫附屬地　維持及該地行政警察並守備兵之駐屯。（二）東北各地領事館及警察之設立。（三）正金及朝鮮銀行金幣鈔票之流通。（四）東北各地日本無綫電之施設等。於中國之領土行政主權及金融。極多危害。是又以何種手段取得並實行。其實行究有何種法律上道德上之根據。日人於此事實其又將何以自解。他如不敷設滿鐵併行綫之密約。日人今亦齗齗爭持。但此密約之有無。根本無從徵信。即其有之。但在我國領土之内。只容滿鐵獨步横行。不許中國自建鐵道。旣爲密約。其本身已缺乏法律與道德之依據。爲情理上所絶不應有。中國人民在今日斷然予以拒絶。亦爲事所必至分所宜然。又如准許敷設吉會綫之約。南滿洲土地商粗之約。滿洲韓僑不動産及其他保護之約。在經濟上或政治上。皆予中國以嚴重之迫害。中國如不自甘亡國。則此種條約。在今日自亦萬難承認。設易地而處。以中國今日之所受者加之於日本。日人是否甘心。公理雖能刦持於暴力。但絶不能　暴力所掩蔽。暴力非可久永依恃。公理終當伸張。日本當亦不乏愛護公理與正義之人士於此亦曾一計及之否。</p>
<p>尤有進者日人今日所齗齗爭辯者不謂所謂「滿蒙特殊權益。」爲以鐵</p>
<p>血換來者乎。吾人且暫承認是種解說爲有相當理由。但依據馬關條約與撲茨茅斯條約所獲得之「特殊權益。」亦自有時間之限制。如南滿路與旅大之租借。爲期僅二十五年。而延長至九十九年。亦果爲以鐵血換來者乎。日人不又謂所謂「特殊權益」之成立。基因於中日地域接壞乎。則世界各國邊境之四週。無不與他國犬牙相錯。誠如日人所持之理由則所謂特殊權益爭執。將永無已時世界豈尙有安寗之日。世界惟被保護國與殖民地。其領土與行政之神聖主權。乃受其宗主國或保護國之干涉與限制。中國則並非殖民地或被保護國也。東北則中國之領土也。於中國領土之内。植立所謂「特殊權益。」其强横無理。豈能以「接壤主義」狡辭辯護。日人每言及「特殊權益。」動輒引石井藍辛協約爲根據。欲以此塞他國之口。而誘起他國之同情。初不知此項協約。美國早已自動撤消。抑且與華府會議中决議尊重中國主權。門户開放。機會均等之原則相違背。其不能存在。蓋亦言順而理正。日人不又謂「滿蒙」爲其生存所必需。故應享有特殊權益乎。但就事實言。在國防上。「東北」爲中國北方之屏藩。在資源上。東北爲中國原料所取給。在移民之意義上。「東北」又爲中國移殖其長江流域過剩人口必要之區。抑且東北之大豆高粱等農産品。尤爲中國關内各省所仰給。是則「東北」亦爲中國生存所必需。日人安能漠視中國生存之所必需。漠視中國之神聖主權。據而爲已之特殊權益範圍。日人每常謂因滿蒙爲其生存上所必需。故對於滿蒙之經營。爲合乎正義與人道之行爲。但另一方面之事實日人奪取朝鮮土地。使數日萬韓人無所依歸。四散漂客。即僑居於中國各處者。已達三百餘萬人之多。此種行爲。果亦爲不背於正義與人道乎。</p>
<p>總之日人所謂「特殊權益」在事實法律道德各方面。絶無成立之可能性。如曰可能則其所依據之理由。不過爲武力兩字。在暴力　脅之下何求而不得日人今固已盤踞我東北矣所謂「特殊權益」已在此種事實之下獲得「正當之解釋」矣。故日人與其作無理之言詞上之辯論母寗從暴力之事實予以顯明之說明。中國目前雖在軍力上未能以實際行動答覆此種無理之解說。但絶對相信在不久之將來總有此一日。。强權終將陳尸於公理與正義之足下中國於此絶無疑慮</p>
<p>中國人民於此。更深盼世界各國。對此所謂「特殊權益。」予以深切之注意。中國問題爲遠東問題之中心。吾人此時已不能否認。如容許任何一國於中國有所謂特殊權益之分割則不啻國際已默認任何一國可以點燃爆發遠東戰禍之引綫。並且承認第二次戰禍爲不可避免中國今無力以制暴力。無力以遏止强暴者之野心。但世界各國不願坐視世界和局之破壞公理之湮没則對此無理之權益謬論及隨此謬論而發生之暴行必將共起作有力之發言及正當之彈劾</p>

<p>世界社云、據日大藏省發表統計、謂歷年中國抵貨運動、日貨輸出雖見减少、但其影響頗爲輕微、一九一九年席貿易額之增加、實由於物價之騰貴、至於此次抵貨運動、範圍極廣、抵貨方法較前進步、就最近一個月統計推算之、本年度對華輸出僅爲六千萬元、約减一萬四千萬日元以上之譜、其影響甚大云、</p>

<p>昨晚九時四十六分　　時、眞茹站先停有由京開滬之第二零二次下行貨列車一列停在該站直道内、因當時麥根路站已準備將第二零七次上行貨車開出、并同時已向眞茹站索得路牌、故眞茹站即將該第二零二次貨車扣住、待交第二零七次、俟第二零七次貨車於十時零三分抵眞茹站、在灣道内停妥後、乃始將第二零二次貨車由眞　放至麥根路、但當時由京開　之第十次快車及第四次客車亦已由南翔及安亭兩站開出、在勢該第二零七次貨車、巳無機會放行、該站長乃將該次貨車扣住、準備交會兩次客車後再放行、詎料該站西分路夫吳勝榮見第二零七次車巳在站交會第二零二次車後、意爲該第二零七次車在理將放至南翔、乃不待站長手號指示、即將分路扳成灣道俾該第二零二次車經過、當時該站站長係替班站長楊文怡、正在辦公室内授給南翔站第十次車路簽、並報告行車時刻、及乎得到南翔站通知第十次車開出南翔站信號後、照例即囑脚夫練阿三扳倒揚旗、放車進站而分路棚内分路夫吳勝榮、竟未留意揚旗倒下、及所扳分路係爲灣道、及待站長發覺分路失所扳車道有誤、乃急吹警笛、並示號誌、令其扳爲直道、但斯時該第十次車已進眞茹站外揚旗瞬息即至裏揚旗分路處、分路夫雖經發覺已屬不及、於是該第十次車乃同進灣道、而同時先停在灣道内之第二零七次貨車又無頭燈、故第十次車上司機、未曾留意、及待駛近、急即煞車、無奈爲勢甚大未即停住、乃發生此不幸之禍變、時正十時三十分、</p>

<p>當兩車相撞、聲震四野、尙幸第二零七次貨車未在行動、已屬不幸中之大幸、否則竟不堪設想、當第二零七次車於被撞時機車B字第三十八號後部、即跌落軌内、機車後所掛煤車兩輛立時躍出翻倒、跌入直道内、第十次車上祇機車C字十三號全部陷入軌内、機車後頭二等車窗玻璃、因受劇震、全部震碎、而車内座位及檯桌等、塌倒不少、車架上輕件行李、亦隨勢倒下、以致車内凌亂不堪、路軌計被毁八根、枕木四十餘根、</p>

<p>昨日第十次車係準點、一般乘客見將近抵滬、均正在整理物件、及兩車發生互撞、因勢過猛、均隨震勢而暈跌、爲桌椅碰傷者有之、互撞而致傷者有之、爲玻璃觸傷者有之爲倒下物件壓傷者有之、總計受傷者約三十餘人、車内血漬斑斑、呻吟之聲不絶、中間以由蘇來滬之陸知傳之妻腹部受傷最重、車上廚房内侍者五人廚子一人、及灣林上車之乘客蔡梅章一名、均傷頭部、車上侍役馮聚金及乘客嚴德厚、均傷、在腿部、第十次車車長費邦彦、頭皮擦傷、其他乘客二十餘人、均手足微傷或腰部及胸部格痛、尙有兵士一名、胸部受傷甚重、</p>

<p>前晚撞車地點適近曁南大學、該校童子軍聞訊、即馳往出事地點查看、見有傷及乘客而路局醫官尙未馳到、乃亟返校、携帶藥品、上車爲各受傷乘客包紮、並爲維持秩序、一種俠義精神、殊堪欽佩、</p>

<p>肇事以後、途中發生障礙、故各車均不能往來、前晚十一時四十五分由　開京之夜車、因此遲至昨晨四時五十三分始離北站、計遲開五小時、由京開滬之夜車、於昨晨八時許抵埠、前日下午四時、由京開滬之第四次特别快車、遲至昨晨四時二十分始抵北站、現下眞茹站灣道、因受創過重、未能立即修復、惟直道已可照常行駛、故昨日間各列車、均已恢復常態、</p>

<p>在熱烈的抗日聲中·很不幸的一件事發現在我們電界實在是很痛心的·這件事的内容。是上海國際無線電台和日本私通消息主角便是該台報務主任魏大銘等三人現在已爲交通部所悉。將魏等三人撤職查辦。這事並非是一椿細微的事。我們須得要保證。今後再没有這種事發生我極盼望任何人。在這樣緊張的空氣中將清晰的頭腦。替個人、家庭、社會、民族、設想。切莫要　任何勢力、或引誘。把自己白白的良心都染黑了。我不知魏某等是何居心。更不知當局對於們有什麽嚴重的懲戒没有。我只勉勵我自己和全國的同胞。不要步他們的後塵。</p>

<p>阿爾的母親實在是不可多得，容許他在家裏放那些毒藥，多至二百瓶丨那位火車上的車掌也有意思，居然讓他在行李車上開辦實騐室丨這都是愛護科學和小朋友的天使。倘使没有這些天使，那麽不容於正式學校之阿爾，又何能容於家庭與社會？小朋友們也不可自暴自棄。除了學校，便没有用功求學的地方嗎？你看阿爾，他厭倦學校之死敎育，回家便在家裏做實騐，上火車便在火車上做實騐。没有錢便賣報賣菜，以所賺的錢來做實騐。他過的是科學的生活，受的是科學的敎育，這不是眞正的生活敎育嗎？他和他的小夥伴一同自己做，自己學，自己敎，不是敎學做合一的證據嗎？紐約泰晤士報說現在在愛迪生（長成的阿爾）的發明和他的發明所推動的事業上所投的資本共有一百五十萬萬美金合華幣七百萬萬元。大家都說中國窮得可憐。救窮之惟一方法是要造富的社會，不造富的個人。美國用愛迪生造了許多大富豪，我們却要用未來的愛迪生來造四萬萬人的富國，和二十萬萬人的富世界。這未來的愛迪生是怎樣來的啊？小時是阿爾大時便自然而然的成了愛迪生。只要先生們少駡幾句壞蛋，社會，家庭，政府多給一些自由空氣，少用一些齊一手段，阿爾，是愛迪生便如雨後春笋一發而不可遏了。</p>

<p>有某西報記者最近由日本來滬。據稱自東省侵略事發。彼國内之情形即大爲緊張。日本國民。固亦不少不滿於軍閥之專横侵略政策。然政府爲軍閥所把持操縱。對於反對軍閥政策之輿論箝制甚力·一方禁止報紙發佈反武力之輿論。一方面揑造中國盜匪侵害日人生命財産之謠言。以煽惑鼓動其民衆使一致對我。凡報紙刋載之新聞消息。無不由　局檢查。而關於軍事行動之新聞。非由彼官方分送者概不准登。故日軍在華之横暴兇殘之眞相彼國民衆。固了無所知也。日本國内思想本甚複雜。社會主義共産主義之信仰者亦殊不少。尤其爲受過高等</p>
<p>敎育之日人。如大學生之類。當局對於此種分子。防範尤嚴。恐其一旦爆發而不利於侵華之進行也。一方面以警察偵探嚴爲監視。一方面則提倡運動。藉以消耗其精神思想。移轉國内青年之注意。故近來棒球競賽之舉行。幾無虚日。雖風雨不輟。彼國當局。對於大學生之思想。時懷惴惴。乃舉行一度對華意見測騐。其問題爲「滿洲是否日本命脈所繫」「日本此次在滿洲之行動是否正當」。結　百分之九十對於此兩問題皆作肯定之答復。於是當局始略爲放心。彼大學生之大多數所以如此作答者。彼國當局揑造事實對内宣</p>

<p>— 荆夢蝶</p>
<p>武進西南鄉。有小邨曰蒲塘者。居民惟六七家。中一家李姓主人早歲雙目失明。因業算命俗稱瞎子。生涯不惡年有盈餘。重以瞽人衣食從儉。頗事居積遂致小康鄉里咸呼李瞎子爲富人矣瞎子無嗣惟一女。待字年華。將贅婿於家以養老。尙未有當也。</p>
<p>邇來萑苻不靖。刦掠成風、里黨游手少年多有結伴爲盜者。以爲瞎子多金。且利其人易與也。前月一夕盜衆七八人至破門而入。瞎子果如遼人之對倭寇持不抵抗主義任其翻箱倒篋。席捲所有。幸瞎子餘財多放欵在外。故損失尙不甚鉅。盜衆以未饜所欲。見李女美貌。遂相與縛其手足。次第就淫之。嬌葩嫩蕊。横被摧殘。女之寃憤可知也至第六人時。旣快獸慾復低首相偎欲圖接吻。不意女竭全力向其肩猛齕一口。若以所受於六人之怨毒洩諸一人之身也。盜負痛而起。時將天曙。呼嘯一聲。作鳥獸散</p>
<p>盜去後。女臥病數日始起。案以離城遠尙未報官盜衆以瞎子何能爲。相率逍遙法外耳。邨東數里。有鎭曰溪南。一市集也。一日午後。女步行至市購物。街梢瞥見一人。儼然曩夜採花受創之第六盜也。盜驟遇女。逡发欲避。女即向之嫣然一笑。盜亦報以微笑。竊喜女猶識我。未能忘情。轉念曩夜之創我。非恨我而實愛我。殆古所謂齧臂盟也。於是徐行尾女。漸挑以語。約之入鎭西某旅館。女欣然諾之。令渠先入。道儂去抵擋一些細事來今夕可勿歸矣。盜喜極入。館間一房間。坐守玉人。待眞個銷魂。遠勝前度之急就章也。未幾女率數警卒至。盜知受紿。而莫可逃乃束手就逮。盜故鎭上人。旣抵局。其交遊某甲某乙踵至。欲爲保繹。謂此人非爲盜者登徒好色。或不免耳。女慨然當衆眞陳前事。且謂渠肩下被齩處。爲日無多。迹猶可認。胡不說衣一騐。局長令袒而視之。則齒痕宛然。創處結痂未脫也。一鞫而服。轉解法院定讞焉。人咸服女之急智。而笑盜之非死於財。而死於色。紅顔之魔力。更甚於黄金云。</p>

<p>— 少卿</p>
<p>二進宫在唱工戲中爲最好聽者。有以下四個特點。一、三角接唱或一句或一段。參互錯綜。唱法變化、二、接唱二黄快元板。頂板不留過門。如急語問答。緊凑異常。三、加襯字爲長句。使板眼變化。四、戲只一塲三種不同嗓音。三種不同扮像鼎足而立。不分賓主。如三色書版。又似三彩磁器。色彩極濃。故此戲非三位嗓子好資格老之好角合唱不可。因搭配不易齊人。舞台上遂不常演。昨於友人處。偶聽高亭新片尙小雲王少樓合唱二進宫。眞有珠聯璧合之妙。此片自大面唱「懷抱着幼主爺把國執掌」起。接唱元板搖板至「保國家還是你楊家父子兵」劇終止。共收四段。尙小雲嗓子極佳。唱守青衣典型、警句極多。如「你道他無有那纂位的心腸」。使節節高之高腔。響遏行雲。圓潤自如。「哀家跪死在昭陽」。死字一頓。在昭陽三字抑揚得法。可媲美陳德霖。「子子孫孫爵禄高」一句。完全翻高。舉重若輕。王少樓唱宗譚派。嗓音特佳。唱來極合曲情。如「唬得臣低頭不敢仰望」唱調面。若奇峯突出。「伴駕山前又收李綱」一句。於極快板中要腔。頓挫别致。餘皆流麗跳脫。裘桂仙爲惟一銅鎚大面。如黄鐘大吕。雄渾大方。絶無俗氣。唱「老臣年邁」之邁字。腔徹聲滿。如老樹着花。「李文北門帶箭喪」及「右到頭來想一想」二句。韻味特勝。三人接唱之快元板二十餘句如行雲流水。一氣呵成。非三人工力悉敵。曷克臻此。</p>

<p>陶遲哎呀一聲，眞個青天霹靂般的受着一個重大的打擊丨睜眼看時，旣没有長老，也没有轉輪椅，也没有無礙庵，也没有繫在大槐樹上的馬匹；所有一切，都是夢境。</p>
<p>不但，遨遊現代的樂園，是夢；而且，遨遊過去的世界，也是夢，兩番坐上轉輪椅子，也是夢：繫馬在大槐樹上而進這座無礙庵，也是夢；騎着馬兒跑向東南西北都跑不通，也是夢。長老的敲夢的杵，只敲醒了他的夢中的夢；他雖醒了，他依舊在做夢！惟有這一下的敲夢的杵，才把陶遲敲醒了。</p>
<p>敲夢的人是誰？是陶遲的母親。敲夢的杵是什麽材料做的？是一捲當日的報紙。原來，陶遲爲着國步艱難，心中鬱鬱不快；「悶到頭來磕睡多」，他竟睡着在自動椅中！他的母親手執着一捲當日報紙，在他頭上拍了一下；他竟受了重大的打擊，宛比當頭劈下一個暴雷一般！</p>

<p>「東北飛機塲，握於暴日掌中！二百多架飛機，悉被塗抹國徽！」</p>
<p>「規模宏大的瀋陽兵工廠，爲暴日刦掠一空！」</p>
<p>「國聯勸告暴日，竟被拒絶！」</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese naval and military officials will hold a joint meeting at the Naval Minister's residence tonight to discuss avoiding the League of Nations Administrative Council regarding the Manchurian issue. It is reported that League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, during the visit of the Japanese Ambassador to Belgium to Geneva on October 26, took the opportunity to advise Japan to withdraw its troops from Manchuria before negotiating with China. Drummond asked the Japanese Ambassador to pay attention to China's letter to the League of Nations regarding the treaty and advised Japan to withdraw its troops based on this guarantee. However, the Japanese government is said to have decided to ignore Drummond's words. The Japanese believe that after the League of Nations Secretary-General proposed a solution to the Manchurian Incident to Japan, he failed to submit it to the Administrative Council, breaking faith and disappointing Japan. Even if Japan agrees to China's proposal to submit outstanding issues to arbitration, Japan must first have China recognize the existing treaties between the two countries. When the League of Nations Administrative Council reconvenes, Japan will present a list of various treaties that China has not fulfilled to the Administrative Council. This is Japan's response to Shi Zhaoji's letter to Briand stating that China recognizes its obligation to respect treaties under the League of Nations Covenant. At the same time, the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that Japan cannot consider submitting the treaty issue to The Hague because there is no issue of treaty invalidity or differing interpretations. Moreover, the Hague verdict must be published after several months or years. During this time, Japan's interests in Manchuria will be at risk. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Sino-Japanese Treaty Disputes Prepared for Full Arbitration <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) China today notified the League of Nations that it is prepared to submit all disputes over the interpretation of treaties between China and Japan to arbitration. However, it is still unknown whether this issue will be brought before the League of Nations. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that the proposal for China and Japan to establish an arbitration treaty will be considered by China after Japan complies with the League of Nations resolution and implements troop withdrawals as necessary, so that all complex outstanding issues between China and Japan can be resolved in principle politically. Particular emphasis is placed on the interpretation of existing treaties between China and Japan. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Disregarding Treaties, Disrupting Peace</p>
<p>(San Francisco) () The eloquent US Senator Hiram Johnson, in a speech to the Chamber of Commerce today, condemned the Japanese military's seizure of Manchuria, recalling the phrase that treaties were equivalent to waste paper during the European War, saying that Manchuria today is a prime example. It is not a real war, but because Japan, seeing its neighbor's pacifism as a guarantee, is too weak, it invaded its territory. He also said that peace must have a price. Johnson vigorously attacked pacifists, especially those who opposed maintaining adequate military equipment and advocated trusting treaties that were merely symbolic. Johnson believes that the Washington Conference only weakened the US Navy, and the London Naval Treaty only made the situation worse for the United States. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The three top officers of the Japanese Army, Chief of Staff Kanaya, Inspector General of Education Muto, and Minister of the Army Minami, held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock to discuss the issue of stationing troops in Manchuria and decided on the following: (1) The 4,000 men of the Korean Mixed Brigade will be withdrawn to their original location. (2) 5,000 men of the 2nd Division stationed in Manchuria whose enlistment has expired will be discharged and return home. (3) When the above two items are withdrawn, an equivalent force will be dispatched at the same time to replace them. (4) Select from the two-year soldiers in the homeland to be sent to Manchuria. (5) The above items will be implemented starting at the end of next month, and whether or not to increase troops will be determined based on the report of Shirakawa's inspection. (Dentsu News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army held a meeting of the three top officers at the Minister of the Army's residence yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock to discuss the following issues: (1) Of the current 14,400 troops stationed in Manchuria, half will have their terms expire and be discharged on November 23. Given the current situation in Manchuria, what should be done? (2) With only more than 14,000 troops stationed in Manchuria, it is difficult to guard the 1,100-kilometer area and maintain the security of the South Manchuria Railway line. Therefore, the soldiers are almost sleepless and constantly on duty, and their tasks become even heavier during the severe cold season. If the current situation in Manchuria continues, troops should be increased within the scope permitted by the treaty. ( ) In that case, should divisions from the homeland be dispatched? As a result of the discussion on these two issues, it was decided that increasing troops would easily cause international misunderstanding, so it was decided to temporarily observe the changes in the situation in Manchuria and discuss this issue after receiving the report from General Shirakawa in Manchuria.

<p>(Beiping) According to returning guests from Shenyang, the Japanese military is equipping winter defenses at various stations along the South Manchuria Railway line, clearly intending to stay for a long time. The Gongzhuling Railway Station has been occupied by the Japanese military. The Japanese military also injured many people and abducted several important officials from the station. The station's own anti-bandit military equipment was also looted by the Japanese, and their actions were very similar to bandits. Local counties are subject to beatings if they do not provide adequate services to the Japanese, and the situation is extremely pitiful. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Currently, the original price of red grain in Liaoyang, Changtu, Haicheng, and other counties is more than two yuan per斗, but the Japanese have set an official price of six 角 per斗, forcing the counties to sell to the Japanese. Those who do not hand over their grain reserves are considered to have committed a crime and are sentenced. As a result, many people have been shot for not selling grain. The red grain is completely transported to Korea, and Korean trains are dedicated to transporting grain. The Japanese want to cause a grain shortage in the Northeast next spring, intending to clear the fields. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

The police chief must also send a police officer every day to search the passenger trains with the Japanese military police and send another railway police officer to search the South Manchuria Railway Station with the military police. Such coercive behavior is truly intolerable. Please instruct on how to deal with it.

<p>(Nanjing) The Huai River Conservancy Association proposed the reasons for adopting employees, saying that the economic issue of the association's implementation of the Huai River project has already been settled. The labor issue can be divided into three categories: hired labor, conscripted labor, and military labor. Hired labor is paid according to work, which is expensive, and it is difficult to manage. It is only suitable for small-scale construction. For the method of conscripted labor, now that disasters have caused people to be displaced, conscripting them to work only provides them with food and warmth, without the high wages of hired labor, and it takes time to conscript them, which is difficult to manage, similar to hired labor. However, military labor is disciplined, well-trained, and can be mobilized in the morning and sent to work in the evening. In the past, during the autocratic era, most of the Green Standard Army also engaged in contracting projects. The current army has fewer smokers, and their ability to work may even surpass them. At the beginning of the Republic of China, Ni Sichong sent troops to dredge the Sui River, which was very effective. Hebei previously used military labor to dredge the Yongding River below the Lugou Bridge, which was praised by foreigners as a model of military labor river management. Now that the Huai River project urgently needs to be implemented, some of the more trained troops should be transferred, disarmed, and engaged in work. At the same time, they should be combined with disaster relief workers and mix soldiers with laborers, so that soldiers become laborers and disaster victims become soldiers. For those who work diligently, military labor will continue to receive their regular salaries, and disaster victims will be provided with food and clothing by the association. In addition, the Huai River project funds will be used to provide each person with a certain amount of labor money each month and a certain number of banknotes, which will be deposited on their behalf. After the Huai River project is completed, the labor money will be distributed to them. The supervision of the work will be carried out by the existing military officers and the supervisors additionally dispatched by the association. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Refuting the Japanese So-Called "Special Rights and Interests in Manchuria and Mongolia" (3) <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The so-called special rights and interests that the Japanese claim to have obtained based on existing treaties – yesterday's commentary already examined the value of their establishment. As for those with no treaty basis, but which are in fact being implemented, such as (1) the maintenance of affiliated areas along the Anfeng Railway Line, the administration and police in those areas, and the stationing of garrison troops; (2) the establishment of consulates and police stations throughout Northeast China; (3) the circulation of gold coins and banknotes of the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Chosen; (4) the installation of Japanese wireless telegraphs in various parts of Northeast China – these cause extreme harm to China's territorial, administrative sovereignty, and financial system. By what means were these acquired and implemented? What legal or moral basis is there for their implementation? How will the Japanese explain these facts? Other examples include the secret agreement prohibiting the construction of railway lines parallel to the South Manchuria Railway. The Japanese are still arguing fiercely about this. However, there is fundamentally no way to verify whether this secret agreement even exists. Even if it does exist, within Chinese territory, only the South Manchuria Railway is allowed to operate freely, while China is not allowed to build its own railways. Being a secret agreement, it inherently lacks a legal and moral basis. In terms of reason and principle, it should absolutely not exist. The Chinese people resolutely reject it today, and it is inevitable and proper that they do so. Furthermore, agreements such as the one permitting the construction of the Jihui Railway Line, the South Manchuria Land Lease Agreement, and the agreement on the protection of Korean residents' real estate and other matters in Manchuria – all inflict serious oppression on China economically and politically. If China does not willingly submit to national subjugation, then these kinds of treaties will be extremely difficult to recognize today. If the situation were reversed, and what China is suffering today were inflicted on Japan, would the Japanese willingly accept it? Although justice can be restrained by violence, it can never be hidden by violence. Violence is not a sustainable reliance; justice will ultimately prevail. Are there not also people in Japan who cherish justice and righteousness? Have they considered this?</p>
<p>Even more, what the Japanese are arguing fiercely about today is that these so-called "special rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia" were obtained through iron and blood. Let us temporarily concede that this explanation has some validity. However, the "special rights and interests" obtained based on the Treaty of Shimonoseki and the Treaty of Portsmouth also have time limits. For example, the lease of the South Manchuria Railway and Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian (Dairen) was only for 25 years, but it was extended to 99 years. Was that also obtained through iron and blood? The Japanese also claim that the establishment of these so-called "special rights and interests" is based on the contiguity of China and Japan. However, the borders of all countries in the world are intertwined with those of other countries. If the reasons put forward by the Japanese were valid, then the disputes over these so-called special rights and interests would never end, and would the world ever have a day of peace? Only in protectorates and colonies is the sacred sovereignty of territory and administration interfered with and restricted by the suzerain or protecting power. China, however, is neither a colony nor a protectorate. The Northeast is Chinese territory. The establishment of so-called "special rights and interests" within Chinese territory, is strong-armed and unreasonable. How can it be defended with the sophistry of "the principle of contiguity"? The Japanese often cite the Lansing-Ishii Agreement as the basis whenever they mention "special rights and interests," intending to silence other countries and elicit their sympathy. They are not aware that the United States has already automatically revoked this agreement. Moreover, it contradicts the principle of respecting China's sovereignty, maintaining an open door, and equal opportunity, as resolved at the Washington Conference. Its inability to survive is thus logical and justified. The Japanese also claim that "Manchuria and Mongolia" are essential for their survival, and therefore they should enjoy special rights and interests there. However, in fact, in terms of national defense, "the Northeast" is China's northern shield. In terms of resources, the Northeast is where China obtains its raw materials. In terms of immigration, "the Northeast" is a necessary area for China to relocate its surplus population from the Yangtze River basin. Moreover, the soybeans, sorghum, and other agricultural products of the Northeast are essential for the various provinces within China proper. Therefore, "the Northeast" is also essential for China's survival. How can the Japanese disregard what is essential for China's survival, disregard China's sacred sovereignty, and seize it as their scope of special rights and interests? The Japanese often say that because Manchuria and Mongolia are essential for their survival, their management of Manchuria and Mongolia is an act that is consistent with justice and humanity. But on the other hand, the Japanese have seized Korean land, leaving tens of thousands of Koreans without a place to live, scattered and adrift. Those residing in various parts of China already number more than three million. Is this kind of behavior truly not contrary to justice and humanity?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the so-called "special rights and interests" claimed by the Japanese have absolutely no possibility of being established in terms of facts, law, or morality. If they say it is possible, then the only basis for it is the word "force." Under the threat of violence, what cannot be obtained? The Japanese have already entrenched themselves in our Northeast. The so-called "special rights and interests" have already gained a "legitimate explanation" under these circumstances. Therefore, instead of engaging in unreasonable verbal debates, the Japanese should provide a clear explanation based on the fact of violence. Although China is currently unable to respond to this unreasonable explanation with practical actions in terms of military strength, it absolutely believes that this day will come in the near future. Might will eventually lie prostrate at the feet of justice and righteousness. China has no doubt about this.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Chinese people deeply hope that all countries in the world will pay close attention to these so-called "special rights and interests." The China issue is the center of the Far Eastern question. We can no longer deny this. Allowing any country to divide China with so-called special rights and interests is tantamount to international recognition that any country can ignite the fuse that will detonate war in the Far East. It also recognizes that a second war is unavoidable. China is currently powerless to restrain violence, powerless to curb the ambitions of the violent. But if the countries of the world are unwilling to sit idly by and watch the destruction of world peace and the suppression of justice, then they will surely rise up together to make powerful statements and proper accusations against this unreasonable fallacy of rights and interests and the atrocities that arise from this fallacy.</p>

<p>Cabinet of Ten About to Be Reorganized</p>

<p>Unemployment Numbers Decrease Instead of Increase</p>
<p>Pound Sterling Exchange Rate Plummets</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th – Yesterday was the day of the British general election. News from all sides indicates a major victory for the Conservative Party and a disastrous defeat for the Labour Party. Heavy fog in many areas reduced voter turnout significantly. Some workers were delayed by the fog and missed their chance to vote, while others could not find polling stations in the fog, and still others were unwilling to brave the fog, giving up their right to vote. However, large crowds gathered in the streets where election results were displayed under lanterns. Movie theaters and theaters remained open until late at night, providing updates on the election results on stage or screen. As of 4 a.m. this morning, the seat count for each party after the first day of elections is as follows: National Party 263 (including 222 Conservatives), National Labour Party 4, Liberal Party 37 (including 14 Simonites), Labour Party 23, Independent 2. The number of seats newly won by each party is as follows: Conservative Party 101, National Labour Party 4, Liberal Party 11. The number of seats lost by each party is as follows: Labour Party 111, Independent 5. Former Labour cabinet members who resigned from the MacDonald cabinet have mostly been defeated, including former Foreign Secretary Henderson, former Minister of Transport Morrison, former Home Secretary Clynes, former War Minister Tom Shaw, former First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, Education Secretary Smith, Minister of Labour Miss Bondfield, and Minister of Health Greenwood. Former Foreign Secretary Henderson was the leader of the Labour Party in Parliament and the secretary of the National Labour Party Executive Committee. He held great influence within the Labour Party and was renowned for his diplomatic work as Foreign Secretary. He was also elected chairman of the International Disarmament Committee, demonstrating the high regard in which he was held. Since disagreeing with MacDonald's political views, he resigned from the Labour cabinet and succeeded MacDonald as leader of the Labour Party. Unexpectedly, he lost in his constituency of Burnley, which he had represented for seven years, to Campbell. Henderson received 2,697 votes, 8,209 fewer than Campbell. Overall, the results of the first day of elections show that MacDonald's policy of prioritizing the country over party is welcomed by the entire nation. Campbell is a retired rear admiral who commanded a secret fleet during the European War to eliminate German submarines, a feat widely recognized. Samuel, a Liberal Party cabinet member of the National Government, and Thomas, a Labour Party (now called the National Party) member who has consistently supported MacDonald, have both been elected. As the Lower House has a total of 605 seats, if the National Government Party gains a few dozen more seats, it will hold a majority in the Lower House. It is expected that the Conservative Party will win 400 seats this time. Reuters, London, 28th – (12:45 PM) Based on the results obtained so far, the National Government is certain to hold a majority in the Lower House. The number of seats each party has won is as follows: Conservative Party 245 seats, National Labour Party 7 seats, Liberal Party 37 seats, "Opposition" Labour Party 23 seats, Independent 2 seats. The Conservative Party has so far won 110 new seats, and the Labour Party has lost 126 of its original seats.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th – (1:50 PM) Based on the current results, the Conservative Party can secure a large majority in the Lower House. Lloyd George still defeated the Conservative Party in the Caernarvon Boroughs, winning with 17,101 votes.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th – Prime Minister MacDonald flew to London this morning before the final vote count was announced, and his daughter, Ishbel, followed him by plane shortly after. It is expected that the National Government will be reorganized. The Prime Minister will consult with Conservative Party leader Baldwin, Liberal Party leader Samuel, and other leaders of the National Labour Party before meeting with the King tomorrow to discuss the matter. It is expected that the new cabinet will have ten more members than the current cabinet, which was limited to ten members during its organization. It is said that the new cabinet members will form a special committee to study various issues. Seating in Parliament has become difficult due to the sudden increase in the number of government party members, as the current number of seats is insufficient to accommodate them all. The opposition party will likely only have two rows of seats. Today, at the stock exchange, government bonds increased by one to two pounds sterling, and industrial and railway securities also rose, due to expectations that import goods will be taxed.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th – MacDonald told a Reuters reporter in Seaham today that the election results he obtained were truly astonishing. He was pleased with two things: one, that Thomas still had the trust of the workers, and two, that Samuel had defeated his Conservative opponent, indicating that this election was an election for the National Government, not a party election.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 28th – French newspapers commented on the British election results with enthusiasm. Le Matin in Paris stated that Britain has given us a great miracle of recovery, and this election is bound to have a significant impact throughout the world. The British people have expressed their determination to oppose disruptive and wasteful policies, especially in the heart of the labor movement.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 28th – The Conservative Party's great victory in Britain has made a deep impression. Business and financial circles here expect Britain to implement protectionist tariffs, no longer considering the recommendations in the Basle Banker's Conference and the Layton Report, which recognized reducing tariff barriers as the main remedy for the global panic.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th – The Ministry of Labour announced tonight that the number of unemployed this week decreased by 28,868 compared to last week. The number of registered unemployed last week was 2,737,000. In Britain, the number of unemployed usually increases during late autumn, but this year it has not only not increased but has steadily decreased, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 27th – The pound sterling exchange rate fell sharply today due to large sales, reaching $3.87. Banks said that the British government was settling large accounts, leading to these sales.</p>

<p>Various Commercial and Industrial Sectors Severely Affected</p>
<p>Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Reports to His Country</p>
<p>Japanese Trade with China This Year</p>
<p>Down by Over 140 Million Yuan</p>
<p>World News Agency reports that, according to a telegram from the Japanese Consul-General Murai stationed in Shanghai to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the anti-Japanese movement is becoming increasingly intense and all-encompassing, severely impacting Japanese trade. Currently, Japanese merchants in Shanghai, except for small traders who deal with Japanese people, are almost out of business. In particular, commercial and industrial operators with less capital are gradually falling into poverty. Some have already reduced their operations or shut down. Details are as follows: (1) "Textile factories" are still continuing to operate, but there are no sales of their products in Shanghai. About 20% of their products are shipped to other ports, with the remainder stockpiled. Even if there are no funding issues, warehouses will be full next month. Many are struggling to support themselves. (2) "Cotton yarn, cotton cloth, sugar, paper, sundries, etc." are all completely shut down. No one is making new purchases, and even agreed-upon goods cannot be delivered. Furthermore, in the case of marine products, not only are there no deliveries, but there are also returns of already delivered balances. (3) "Export goods" such as bran, rapeseed, cottonseed, oilseed cake, etc., are currently not being shipped. For example, bran is difficult to dispose of. (4) "Banks and shipping companies" are hampered in their operations due to the resignation of compradores. In particular, banks dealing with special currencies cannot continue to operate without compradores. Furthermore, because Chinese money shops and banks refuse to pay bills of exchange and refuse to sell silver dollars, business has suddenly collapsed. Nisshin Shipping has stopped scheduled sailings due to a sharp decline in cargo and passengers. (5) "Various factories" have many employees who are different from those in yarn factories and are negligent in their work, and there are continued cases of those who cannot maintain operations due to funding issues. Among them, many of the various small industries recently established, such as printing, rubber, enamel, and ironware, are temporarily closed or will be closed. (6) "Small traders" (who deal exclusively with Chinese people) have no business at all. Chinese shop assistants continue to resign.</p>
<p>World News Agency reports that, according to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, although exports of Japanese goods have decreased due to the anti-Japanese goods movement in previous years, the impact has been relatively minor. The increase in trade volume in 1919 was actually due to rising prices. However, this current anti-Japanese goods movement is very broad in scope, and the methods of resisting Japanese goods are more advanced than before. Based on the statistics of the most recent month, it is estimated that exports to China this year will be only 60 million yuan, a decrease of over 140 million Japanese yen. The impact is very significant.</p>

<p>Indian Sales of Cash</p>
<p>Sufficient to Remedy Silver Prices</p>
<p>National News, Portland, 27th – The governors of the western states of America met here today and recognized that the suspension of silver coinage is largely responsible for the world's economic downturn. Pan Lei, Chairman of the American Silver Mining Association, claimed that the sharp decline in silver prices has deprived nearly half of the world's population of their purchasing power. Governor Duen of Utah proposed that the meeting pass a resolution requesting President Hoover to convene an international silver conference. Reuters, London, 28th – India is currently shipping cash to England. The Morning Post commented on this matter this morning, stating that the outflow of Indian cash is unrelated to the government and is actually a part of the Indian people selling their gold reserves. India is currently exchanging gold for silver, and if it continues to do so, it can adjust the relative prices of gold and silver, becoming a natural remedy for the excessively low silver prices.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Hsi-Chia and Japan <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Rumors of Secret Agreements Negotiated</p>
<p>The Loss of Kirin in One Fell Swoop</p>
<p>A correspondent in Beiping reports that according to those newly returning to Beiping from Kirin, after the Japanese army occupied Jilin, they greatly encouraged Hsi-Chia, as he was a banner man, a member of the Manchu imperial family, and a student of General Muto (during his studies at the Japanese Military Academy). Initially, Hsi was still somewhat apprehensive and dared not accept. The Japanese, on the one hand, used force to pressure him, and on the other hand, used kind words to persuade him, tempting him with benefits and seducing him with women, lavishly flattering him in every way, even more so than they treated Li Wanyong, the Korean traitor at the time. Hsi-Chia was overwhelmed by the favor and became ecstatic, gradually no longer caring about anything else and resolutely declaring independence. The Japanese machinations and methods are truly astonishing. When the Japanese army first entered Jilin, their targets included not only Hsi-Chia but also Rong Hou, the Director of Finance, as both were banner men. However, Rong Hou had different intentions. After hearing about the Shenyang Incident on September 19, he advocated resistance to the Japanese army. Hsi-Chia refused, saying that his superiors had instructed him to take a non-resistance approach and that soldiers should obey orders and not act freely. Seeing that Hsi would not listen, Rong Hou knew that he was timid and unable to take on the responsibility. He immediately counted and handed over two million yuan in cash from the Kirin provincial treasury to Hsi-Chia, saying that he had been Director of Finance for eight years and that outsiders misunderstood, saying that he had filled his own pockets. In reality, he was still penniless. What he could take comfort in was that the savings of Kirin province were now several million in cash, which had been accumulated over the years from the profits of the Yongheng Official Bank's mining and forestry businesses. Now, he was handing them over to him, and he should make good use of them. After handing over the funds, he immediately resigned and fled, hurrying to Harbin within a day. On the morning of the 21st at 6:00 AM, the Japanese army confiscated the weapons of the police departments of the Jichang and Jidun Railways in Changchun. At 10:00 AM, after the matter was completed, they boarded the train and went straight to Jilin. Upon receiving the news, Hsi-Chia urgently summoned representatives from various legal entities to welcome the Japanese army at Jiuzhan (the third station west of Jilin). Hsi also personally went to the station, bowing and scraping to greet the Japanese army. When the Japanese army arrived, the leader was Muto. The meeting of the teacher and student somewhat reduced Hsi's trembling state. After entering the city, Muto learned that Rong Hou had left and saw that Hsi-Chia was easily deceived. He first used pressure tactics, ordering him to hand over all the weapons of the provincial garrison and the police. Hsi requested an extension because it was late at night. The next morning, he handed over more than 500 rifles and some ammunition. Muto was dissatisfied with the small amount and scolded him, ordering him to search again. Hsi then collected more than 1,000 rifles, and Muto was slightly satisfied, changing his pressure tactics and adopting a policy of appeasement. Rumors that we once threatened each other with guns and detained Hsi for several hours are all rumors and are not credible. Seeing that Muto treated him with courtesy and offered all kinds of inducements, Hsi regarded Muto as his benefactor. From then on, Hsi listened to everything and followed every plan. Seeing that Hsi had already fallen into his trap, Muto proceeded to induce him to declare independence and also requested Liaoning to declare independence, which was no longer a problem. In the future, the new regime in the Northeast would definitely be acquired by the restoration faction. Puyi was already on his way, and Prince Gong and Prince Su were also on their way. You are a member of the imperial family and have made great contributions. I will use my influence as your teacher to guarantee that the real power in Kirin province will belong to you. Hearing this, Hsi was still slightly hesitant, fearing that Zhang and Liang would return to Shenyang and that Zhang Zuoxiang would return to his homeland. At that time, he would miscalculate. Knowing his intentions, Muto further incited him, saying that the two Zhangs had no hope of returning. If the restoration fails, the Japanese army will permanently occupy the three provinces. Even if you want to save yourself, I can hardly guarantee it, let alone your position. After this incitement, Hsi's mind was greatly made up, and the act of independence was realized on September 30. Seeing that Hsi had declared independence and his mission was accomplished, Muto immediately returned to Shenyang and dispatched Colonel Tsuboi as the Jilin Garrison Commander. All administrative matters were carried out under his command. However, he treated Hsi-Chia with the utmost respect in private, and within a few days, he presented Hsi with two courtesans, nominally as concubines, but in reality, to secretly monitor his actions. Money was used according to Hsi's wishes, without any reservations. However, when it came to official matters, he immediately put on a stern face and refused to budge. As a result, Hsi enjoyed more freedom in private than in any other era, but he had no real power at all. Since the beginning of this month, newspapers in China have criticized Hsi for betraying the country, and telegrams from all sides have been pouring in, severely condemning him. Although Hsi was unable to read them all, he occasionally caught a glimpse of one or two, and people were constantly whispering that Hsi Er Ye (Hsi Xing Er), what he had done, was deeply hated by all parties in Beiping and Nanjing. These words reached Hsi's ears, and he became wary again. On the one hand, he issued orders to the counties one after another, subtly explaining his difficulties and asking for understanding. On the other hand, he bought off former "piglet" parliamentarians, giving them titles such as advisors and consultants, sending them to the counties to preach his virtues. The generally unscrupulous parliamentarians seized this opportunity and rushed to their respective destinations with joy. However, most of the counties refused to obey because Hsi had already betrayed the country and had no real power. In particular, the actual power was held by the garrison commanders of Jichang, Yilan, Yanji, Binjiang, Suining, and Wuzhen, who refused to obey Hsi's orders. Hsi's plan was exhausted. He was forced to secretly discuss with the Japanese side, promising favorable terms to make the Japanese side recognize Zhang Zuoxiang as co-governor of Jilin, as a means of currying favor with Zhang Zuoxiang and demonstrating his support. It is said that the Japanese side was represented in this meeting by Mitsujo, the chief writer of the Dongbao and advisor to the Jilin Japanese Army Garrison Command. After three days of consultation, an agreement was reached. At 3:00 PM on October 18, Hsi-Chia held a grand banquet for his guests at the Provincial Government. Those present from the Japanese side included Commander Muto, Garrison Commander Yano (Tsuboi had left his post), Commander of the Military Police Ohtani Risaburo, Japanese Consul Ishisha Dairo, and Mr. Mitsujo. From the Chinese side, there were Zhang Jietou, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Chamber of Commerce, Xie Guanglin, Chairman of the Farmers' Association, Jiang Dafeng, Chairman of the Labor Union, and Han Shiqing and Zhang Shousan, Chairmen of the Education Association, etc. Amidst laughter and merriment, the agreement was formally signed. At that time, from the Governor's Office to Henan Street, sentries, cavalry, machine gun squads, and plainclothes detectives were densely deployed. The situation was tense, as if facing a formidable enemy. The state of emergency lasted until 6:00 PM. The contents of the secret agreement, as heard, are recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  The Jihui Railway shall be completed within three months, with simultaneous construction starting from Yanji and Dunhua, and it shall be converted to double track.</p>
<p>2.  Japan shall have the right to designate land for purchase throughout Kirin Province.</p>
<p>3.  The commercial ports (Jilin and Changchun) shall be leased in perpetuity.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Zhang Haipeng's Plot to Attack Longjiang: A Detailed Account <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Heilongjiang Army Strictly Refuses Zhang, His Plan Thwarted</p>
<p>Zhang's Troops Defect, Causing Division</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul in Heilongjiang Moves to Harbin</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Now that the Japanese have occupied Liaoning and Jilin provinces, they are eager to annex Longjiang. However, their public declarations state that their scope is limited to the South Manchurian Railway zone. Since Longjiang is located in northern Manchuria, there is no reason to send troops. Thus, they employed sinister schemes, using Chinese traitors as their pawns, while they remained behind the scenes, issuing orders. Zhang Haipeng, the traitor and garrison commander of Taonan, whose courtesy name is Xiantao, came from a bandit background. Although he is nearly seventy years old and holds a high official position, his ambition is still frequently revealed in his words. When Wan Fulin was in charge of Longjiang, during the time when Yang Yuting and Chang Yinhuai were executed and political turmoil was stirring, Zhang had long harbored the intention of seizing power. He had secretly allied with a certain high official, planning to coordinate actions. However, the high official changed his mind at the last moment and remained idle. Zhang realized that his own forces were too weak and ultimately did not dare to launch an attack. Although this matter was quelled before it could happen, everyone knew his intentions. The Japanese noticed his hidden desires and knew that Zhang's fourth son was usually associated with bandits and commanded more than two thousand men, acting lawlessly. They could easily use profit and desire to manipulate him. This is the reason why the Japanese enticed Zhang to become a traitor. I will now describe it in detail as follows:</p>
<p>First, a Japanese man named Tomosaburo, claiming to be acting under the order of the Kwantung Army Commander, visited Zhang and asked him to take charge, promising that everything in Liaoning Province would be supported by the Japanese. Zhang initially hesitated because a certain military officer under his command advised him against it, fearing he would fall into the Japanese trap. Therefore, he did not give a clear answer at the time. Not many days after Tomosaburo left, a Japanese army major named Oishi, carrying the Kwantung Army Commander's calling card and a letter of introduction, said that he had secret matters to discuss in person and requested an audience. The major told Zhang, "Currently, most of the key officials in the three northeastern provinces have left their posts. Among the senior military officers, only Your Excellency is the most respected and esteemed. Not only does our Commander admire you, but even the Emperor knows Your Excellency's prestige. Therefore, our army now wants to invite Your Excellency to take the position of Chairman of Jiang Province. Our army will fully provide all the military equipment and supplies needed." Although Zhang remained ambiguous and evasive, the major had already discerned his intentions. Therefore, after the major left, he secretly promised Zhang's fourth son a large sum of money as an inducement. A few days later, the Japanese suddenly transported two trainloads of military weapons and ammunition, which stopped at Taonan Station. Zhang was not initially aware of this. When he sent a representative to the train to inquire with the Japanese, they falsely claimed that the weapons were being transported to the Mongolian Youth League and that they would immediately confiscate the weapons of the reclamation army because the mastermind of the Nakamura incident, although not part of this force, was still part of the reclamation army. Zhang clearly knew that the Japanese had ulterior motives and were using this trick as a tool for coercion. Therefore, he decided to play along, demanding that the Japanese hand over the two trainloads of weapons to him. The Japanese agreed. Zhang also telegraphed Vice Commander Zhang and Chairman Wan about this matter. Zhang felt self-satisfied, thinking that he had obtained a large amount of weapons without effort (these weapons were stolen by the Japanese from the Liaoning Arsenal), which would allow him to increase his military strength and consolidate his position. However, things did not go as planned. Within a few days, the Japanese repeatedly urged Zhang to send troops to attack Jiang Province, pressing him aggressively. At this time, Zhang had already realized that he had fallen into the Japanese trap, but it was too late to regret and there was no way to escape. He had no choice but to send a special envoy to report the situation to the military and political authorities, requesting their understanding. After a week of back-and-forth consultations, the provincial authorities, realizing that Zhang's intentions were set and irreversible and knowing that the Japanese would follow him, feared that any armed resistance would lead to a repeat of the Jinzhou tragedy, causing great losses to the people and devastating the region. Therefore, they convened an emergency meeting. Some military personnel advocated for war, while Chief of Staff Xie Ke strongly advocated for peace. In this critical situation, they preferred to act pragmatically rather than stick to the rules and take responsibility themselves. Once the decision was made, they issued an order on the spot, notifying the front lines to withdraw their defenses. Meanwhile, representatives from various legal entities took a special train to Taonan to welcome Zhang, with the attached request that Zhang follow public opinion and postpone his arrival in Jiang for two or three days so that the troops in various locations could be transferred in an orderly manner to prevent any contact or accidental clashes in the meantime. After the delegation left, they received an urgent telegram from Bei'an that same evening, ordering them not to retreat and to do their utmost to stop Zhang, even if it meant defending with all their strength, down to the last soldier. At the same time, there was a telegram appointing Ma Zhanshan (then the Heihe Garrison Commander) as Chairman of the Jiang Province government, with a clause stating that he would also serve as Commander-in-Chief in the event of war. At this point, the morale of the troops suddenly rose and their momentum increased greatly. They immediately increased the deployment of troops and headed to Jiangqiao (about 120 li from the provincial capital) and other places to keep Zhang's troops in check from a distance. At this time, Zhang had already arrived in the province on the delegation's special train. When he arrived in Tailai County, he learned that the situation had changed drastically and that the Jiangqiao (originally a wooden bridge more than a li long) had been blown up and was impassable. Zhang immediately turned back, leaving only a small vanguard force behind, which did not have time to retreat and therefore had some conflict with the provincial army. On the 15th, a Japanese plane flew over, a small plane that circled the provincial capital four times. At times, it flew very low, only a few dozen feet from the rooftops. Those looking up from below could clearly see two people on board, one of whom was constantly looking down through binoculars. The fuselage was gray, with the number 87. Each wing had a sun-shaped mark with a red circle. It did not drop any bombs but dropped a package over the Japanese consulate, presumably containing important documents that could not be sent by mail. It then flew away. The 16th was the day scheduled for war against Zhang. The citizens were extremely frightened, fearing that planes would come to intimidate the province. Fortunately, there was wind and rain all day long, and the planes did not appear. On the 17th, there were also no signs of planes. On the 18th, a plane flew in from the Taonan area. It looked similar to the one that had come before, but this time it flew very high and only circled the provincial capital once before flying southwest (in the direction of South Manchuria). It is speculated that the reason it did not dare to fly low was perhaps because on the 16th, near Tailai County, four Japanese planes dropped bombs, one of which was shot down by our army with artillery, wounding one Japanese and capturing another. Furthermore, on the 17th, the Heihe Military Police Enforcement Office posted a notice stating that in the future, any Japanese planes or planes from Zhang's rebel army that came to the provincial capital would be shot down with anti-aircraft guns, and merchants and residents should not panic. The Japanese may have learned of this news, which is why the plane that came today was so cautious. It is also possible. Currently, the military strength in Jiang Province totals four brigades, all under the command of Ma Zhanshan. The military resources are abundant and sufficient for deployment. Furthermore, according to reliable reports, Xu and Zhang's regiments under Zhang's command, deeply understanding the greater good, have defected and launched a counter-offensive. Therefore, Zhang's internal forces are now divided and in disarray. Although the Japanese army is providing support from behind, it is unlikely to be of any use. It is truly a case of collapsing without being attacked. Zhang's eldest son currently occupies the position of Director of the Tao'an Railway Bureau. Although the reclamation army is also under his control, fortunately, there are many who can distinguish right from wrong in the army and will not be loyal to Zhang. Currently, a portion of Regiment Commander Zhu's troops no longer obey Zhang's orders and have automatically retreated to the Jingxing area. Currently, the Japanese consulate and the South Manchuria Railway office in the provincial capital are empty. All of them left the provincial capital for Harbin three days ago. Before leaving, the Japanese consul sent a letter to Chief of Staff Xie Ke of the Military Headquarters, thanking him for the hospitality. The Korean residents were also given travel expenses by the Japanese consulate to go to Harbin. Only a small number of those not on the Japanese consulate's list, like stray dogs, had nowhere to go. However, these people all relied on opium dens for a living and were usually acquainted with lower-class vagrants, so they were still able to hide temporarily.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Wuhu All Circles Sever Relations with Japan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Many Chinese Employees of Japanese Stores Resign Voluntarily</p>
<p>Legal and Education Circles Telegraph Request for Declaration of War</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Since the Japanese invasion and occupation of the three northeastern provinces, all circles in Wuhu have been extremely indignant. All schools immediately implemented military training and organized propaganda teams, first promoting in the urban area and now moving to rural areas. The theaters, due to the drop in water levels, are scheduled to resume screenings on the first of next month and have been ordered to select more adventurous and patriotic films to stimulate the people's enthusiasm for saving the country. The volunteer army initiated and organized by the education circle has applied to the volunteer army committee of all circles for registration. The volunteer army preparatory committees of the chambers of commerce and various trade associations have also elected Tao Yudang, Chen Shaotang, and Xu Xinpu as director and deputy directors, respectively, and will apply for organization soon. The regulations are drafted in accordance with the Shanghai volunteer army's measures. Staff members of the county party headquarters and the public security bureau still take turns giving public speeches at the YMCA every night to resist Japan and save the country. Sun Huaxin, the executive of the student department of the Liaoning YMCA, recently came to Wuhu to report to all circles the various atrocities he witnessed committed by the Japanese. Everyone who heard it was filled with indignation. In recent days, schools such as the Senior Elementary School, No. 2 Girls' Middle School, No. 7 Middle School, No. 1 Vocational School, and the Guangyi Elementary School of the Wuhu Customs have all invited Sun to give lectures on national humiliation to expand their deep understanding of Japan. The various middle schools have recently initiated the organization of a joint anti-Japanese national salvation association, planning to publicly elect representatives to go to the capital to attend the national student anti-Japanese representative conference. The various elementary schools have initiated the saving of candy money for national salvation, estimating that 300 yuan can be obtained each month. Due to the continuation of Japanese military atrocities, the business community is filled with indignation and believes that only economic severance can control the lives of the Japanese. They will comply with the anti-Japanese meeting resolution to seal up Japanese goods and order all stores to print anti-Japanese slogans on advertising paper. Although the mining coal is under contract with Japanese ships and cannot be transported to Wuhu to supply factories with small boats, other mining coal can still be transported to replace it. All Chinese who work on Japanese ships and in Japanese stores have voluntarily resigned to express their spirit of non-cooperation. The dare-to-die corps of party members is being organized. The county party headquarters is being partially reorganized and will strengthen the anti-Japanese work to unify the anti-Japanese steps and handle rapeseed registration. Shibata Shirao, the Japanese consul stationed in Wuhu, has recently changed to using Japanese in documents exchanged with the county government. County magistrate Yu Yuying, believing that his etiquette was improper and violated international practice, sent a letter back requesting him to respect the main body and change to using Chinese. Furthermore, a small boat of the Mitsubishi Company of Japan recently struck and killed Fu Xiaohuzi, who was engaged in singing for a living. The court sent a prosecutor to examine the body, and the public security bureau and the county government separately sent personnel to investigate and will present a negotiation to the Japanese consul. The anti-Japanese associations of the various county schools and the lawyers' association believe that the Japanese are intentionally provoking in the Yangtze River area and have separately telegraphed the central national government, requesting severance of diplomatic relations with Japan and the speedy declaration of war. Their anger is very strong, which shows the prosperity of the popular spirit in Wuhu. (October 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Hankou's Japanese Tai'an Yarn Factory Closes Voluntarily <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Consul in Hankou Sends a Letter to the Police Department to Intimidate</p>
<p>Unemployed Workers Petition the City Government for Relief</p>
<p>All Yangtze River Japanese Ships Will Cease Operations</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Tai'an Yarn Factory, opened by Japanese merchants in Hankou, closed voluntarily on the 16th of this month, citing the Chinese boycott movement, causing thousands of Chinese workers to become unemployed suddenly. In the ten days since the factory closed, the unemployed workers have never made excessive demands on the factory and have tried their best to avoid disorderly actions. However, the Japanese made unfounded remarks, saying that the workers would face severe consequences. Therefore, on the 26th, the factory was closed, and the Japanese Consul-General sent a letter to the Garrison Headquarters requesting protection, which was close to intimidation. After receiving the letter, the Police Department immediately sent a reply refuting it and ordered Battalion Commander Fan to strengthen protection. However, after the factory closed, thousands of workers were completely released from the factory. The labor-management issues are being handled by the City Party Headquarters, the City Government, and the City Federation of Trade Unions, trying their best to avoid direct negotiations between the workers and the factory. However, because the workers suddenly became unemployed, and it was extremely difficult to make a living after the floods, they elected Yu Shaoqing, Cui Haitao, Guo Yushan, Pi Yishan, and Zhang Shanzhi as representatives to petition the City Government. Mayor He Baohua was out on official business, so He Diqin met with them instead, but there were no results. On the 27th, the representatives went to the City Government again. He Baohua met with them in person. The worker representatives first described the process of the Tai'an Yarn Factory's voluntary shutdown and closure, as well as the difficult living conditions of the workers after their unemployment, and requested relief, and put forward three requests: (1) Request the Tai'an Yarn Factory to pay severance pay for six months, and reply within three days; (2) Before the severance pay is resolved, the factory should pay each worker a daily living allowance of four dimes a day; (3) Request the City Government to find ways to place the workers so that they will not be unemployed. Mayor He replied that he would negotiate with the Japanese consul regarding the severance pay, the government would temporarily advance the living allowance, and he would try his best to find jobs. The worker representatives, satisfied with the reply, left the City Government and notified the workers to wait quietly for a resolution. Regarding the second request, the City Government immediately advanced the funds that day and distributed them together with the Party Headquarters and the Trade Union to temporarily maintain the lives of the workers.</p>
<p>In other news, since the Mukden Incident, all circles here have been filled with grief and indignation. Therefore, no one patronizes the Japanese shipping company Nisshin Kisen's Yangtze River ships, which are about to cease all operations. Ships such as the Dayuan, Dali, Daji, and Dafu on the Shanghai-Hankou route, Daheng on the Hankou-Yichang route, and Wuling on the Hankou-Changsha route have no passengers or cargo to carry, whether upstream or downstream. Currently, most of the stewards on these ships have returned to their hometowns, and all the sailors and pilots have also voluntarily resigned. It is rumored that the company intends to lease all of its Yangtze River ships to British merchants to manage on their behalf, but the British merchants fear causing resentment among the Chinese and have not dared to accept.

<h3 id="e85">Guangdong Province Ends Hunan's Miscellaneous Troops <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Chen Chuliang's Troops Dissolved</p>
<p>Yan Renyi's Troops Reorganized</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: When the Guangdong-Guangxi armies entered Hunan some time ago, Tang Shengzhi had reorganized several brigades of Hunan's miscellaneous troops, handing them over to Chen Jitang to be incorporated into the First Army Corps as pioneers for entering Hengzhou, Hunan. The troops of Chen Tiejian, Zhao Zixin, Yan Renyi, and Chen Chuliang had successively approached Hengzhou. Before long, the proposal for peaceful unification arose, and the Guangdong-Guangxi armies returned. The troops that had advanced deep into the vicinity of Hengzhou were intercepted by the Hunan He-faction troops and suffered some losses. The remaining troops, led by Yan Renyi and Chen Chuliang, retreated to the area of Pingshi and Lechang on the Guangdong border. Later, because the newly formed army had poor discipline, causing discontent among the local people, they filed a complaint with the First Army Corps Headquarters. The Headquarters secretly ordered the troops of the 7th Division of the 3rd Army, stationed in Lechang, commanded by Huang Yanzhen, to dispatch a team to Dongtou Street on the evening of the 15th of this month, surrounding and disarming Chen's troops. Regiment Commander Zhou Yunshan fled in fear of punishment. The officers and soldiers of his command were all repatriated to their hometowns by the 7th Division. However, since Chen Chuliang had not committed any illegal acts, the First Army Corps appointed him as the commander of the directly subordinate 7th Brigade, allowing him to recruit and form an army anew. Furthermore, the troops of Yan Renyi's newly formed 1st Division, currently stationed in Chenzhou, are also being reorganized. Yan Renyi telegraphed the Headquarters yesterday, requesting that the name of the newly formed 1st Division be canceled and that the Division Headquarters, as well as the officers and cadets, and the 1st battalion of infantry under his command, be assigned to other units or disbanded. After receiving the report, Chen Jitang quickly approved the cancellation of the Division's name and ordered that his troops be received and reorganized by Gong Hao (Gong is currently serving as a commander in a certain army of the Fourth Army Corps). The pay for this unit, starting from November, will be received directly by Gong from the National Government. At the same time, he sent a telegram to Guangxi Province, ordering Gong to be notified and handle the matter. (October 23rd)</p>

<p>Yesterday, our reporter met with a senior central figure and asked what attitude the central government held towards the ongoing peace and unity this time. The reply was that at this time when the nation is facing a major crisis, unity against foreign aggression is of course not a problem. The central government's attitude towards this matter is that no matter how difficult it is, it will discuss with the comrades in Guangdong with the utmost sincerity and discuss any issues at length to come to a perfect solution in order to achieve the goal of thorough unity in the future.</p>

Although he attended the preliminary meeting today, it was in the nature of a conversation, just talking to each other.

<p>Mr. Hu Hanmin has been overworked for several days, and he has also been meeting with guests and talking too much every day, which has led to insomnia and increased blood pressure at night. After meeting with representatives of the Capital's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association with Wang Jingwei and others yesterday morning, he felt particularly tired. At around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, he suddenly suffered severe abdominal pain and urgently summoned a doctor for treatment. The doctor ordered him to rest quietly, so he declined all visiting guests.

<p>The Capital's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent representatives to Miles Road yesterday to see Mr. Hu Hanmin. At that time, Mr. Wang Jingwei was also at Mr. Hu's residence, so Wang and Hu met with the representatives at the same time. They both put forward opinions on the issues of peaceful reunification, foreign policy, and the restoration of the mass movement, and petitioned Wang and Hu. Regarding the issue of peaceful reunification, both stated that it was already being discussed in the peace conference and that there would be considerable results in the future. As for the issue of foreign policy, Mr. Hu earnestly told the representatives at the time that China may now have a solution only by implementing revolutionary diplomacy. As for the past foreign policy achievements, not to mention the warlord era, even since the establishment of the National Government in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, we have talked about revolutionary diplomacy in words, but in practice, there is not much difference. Therefore, if we need to improve in the future, there must be a thorough reform. Then Mr. Wang spoke, saying that in the past, the Republic of China's politics, foreign policy, finance, and mass movement were all dominated by the military, so that everything could not develop freely. Therefore, what the Chinese people should strive for now is only to seek political liberation within the scope of the military. If this greatest goal can be quickly achieved, then all problems can be solved easily.</p>

<p>More than 20 party members from this city, including Wu Qiyu, Wang Zhisheng, and Jiang Hao, organized the Peace and Unity Promotion Association of Party Members in this city. Yesterday afternoon, they specially sent representatives Wang Zhisheng, Ge Hecai, Jiang Hao, Li Qiaozhi, Tang Wenquan, Wu Qiyu, and others to call on Mr. Wang Jingwei. The record of his conversation is as follows: (1) The representatives offered their opinions, hoping that this peace would be a revolutionary peace. After the peace, the party, government, and military must be thoroughly reformed. In terms of foreign policy, revolutionary diplomacy must be vigorously implemented. Wang replied, saying that he very much agreed with your opinions. Today's peace conference has decided that the Nanjing side will still be responsible for conducting foreign policy, but the principles and guidelines will be jointly decided by both sides. (2) The representatives asked about the results of today's peace conference. Wang replied that the meeting had not yet discussed internal affairs, but personally, I believe that at a minimum, the military and government must be separated before peaceful reunification is possible. If politics is still dominated by military forces, then there is absolutely no hope for political clarity, and democratic forces will have no way to establish themselves. (3) The representatives expressed that there is no freedom of speech and that the opinions of all sectors cannot be expressed. They hoped that the peace conference could first restore freedom of speech. Wang replied that he would do his best to do so.</p>

<p>Jiangsu gentry Li Genyuan and Zhang Yi sent a telegram yesterday, saying: "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Nanjing and Mr. Wang Jingwei in Shanghai, The way to establish a country lies first in cherishing talent. Those who possess both literary and military talents and are able to help overcome difficulties are even more rare. Chiang Fang-chen, the former principal of the Baoding Military Academy, is a senior figure in the military circles who has studied in Germany and Japan and is widely admired. He has been detained for a long time due to suspicion of communicating with Tang Mengxiao and has not been released. Now that Mengxiao has followed the Guangdong representatives to resist foreign aggression with one heart, Mr. Chiang should be lenient and give amnesty, without waiting for further ado. We beg that he be given his freedom as in the cases of Li Renchao, Ju Juesheng, and Fang Shuping, so that he can participate in the staff work, which will be beneficial to foreign policy and military affairs. Back then, Guan Zhong released his resentment against the hook shooter, and Meng Ming made meritorious service by being bestowed with favor. This will be enough to win over the hearts of the people and show the impartiality of the government's decrees. This humble opinion, is it appropriate? We respectfully await your consideration and judgment."</p>
<h3 id="e109">Japanese Marines Land in Pudong Yesterday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Seized Japanese Goods, Red Bricks</p>
<p>But Were Cleverly Justified and Returned</p>
<p>The Situation at the Time Was Dangerous</p>
<p>Request to Lodge a Protest</p>
<p>According to a confidential report, the Anti-Japanese Association's Pudong inspection unit learned yesterday morning that five barges of red bricks sold by a Japanese person to a Chinese factory to build a chimney were sailing on the Huangpu River. At a time when the economic severance with Japan is so tense, the factory has forgotten that the country has been invaded by the violent Japanese and purchased a large number of bricks, which is unacceptable to the people. The unit immediately dispatched several inspectors to intercept the five barges of red bricks and escort them to the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, preparing to unload them into the nearby Yuanchang Warehouse for temporary storage, and then submit a report for consideration and punishment. Unexpectedly, at noon, a Japanese person, claiming to be Masuda Yuto, a representative of the Japanese firm Arai Yoko, arrived at the scene and forcibly demanded that the goods be returned to the inspectors. The inspectors immediately informed him that the goods had already been purchased by a Chinese person, and the goods belonged to the Chinese person and foreigners should not intervene. If there is a reason to disagree, he can negotiate with the General Association. However, the Japanese person repeatedly demanded and begged softly, and the inspectors ignored him because they saw that he could not be persuaded reasonably. They hired laborers to move the goods to the wharf and waited to put them into the warehouse. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM, the Japanese person returned with more than 20 fully armed marines from the Japanese Ataka warship, who arrived at the wharf on a small gasoline boat. All the guns were bayoneted, and they stabbed the laborers who were carrying the goods. The laborers were all empty-handed and had to dodge. Some who walked a little slower were stabbed in the legs by the Japanese soldiers' bayonets. The Japanese soldiers spread out guards on both sides of Pengjia Road and Dongchang Road for more than 20 feet, preventing pedestrians from passing by, as if facing a formidable enemy. Zhang, the district chief of the Third District Public Security Bureau, was informed and immediately led armed policemen to investigate and first questioned the Japanese soldiers why they landed with weapons and said that if there was a reason, they should follow the proper procedures. The Japanese soldiers had nothing to say. The district chief ordered them to return to the warship and sent representatives to explain. An officer named Dai Bang ordered the soldiers to board the ship first and accompanied the Arai representative to Chen, the district chief, saying that the red bricks were sold to the Japanese-owned Neiwai Cotton Mill in Xiaoshadu and were not purchased by a Chinese person. The district chief then allowed the return and instructed the inspectors that if they found that the Japanese bricks were transported in by a Chinese factory, they would be seized. A storm was finally over. Afterwards, District Chief Zhang reported the situation to the General Bureau and lodged a serious protest with the Japanese consul. The inspection station also reported the details to the Anti-Japanese Association. The Standing Committee of the Association immediately resolved: (1) to ask the municipal government to lodge a serious protest, and (2) to send a letter to the factory to inquire and ask for a reply.</p>

<p>Severely Punish Lacquer Merchants Chen Yutai and Others</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this city sent a letter to the Hankou Anti-Japanese Association yesterday, saying: "According to a confidential report, the raw lacquer produced in our country is a natural specialty, especially necessary for industry. The Japanese are cunning and good at imitating, and because of the relationship between weather and geography, they cannot cultivate or imitate it. Every year, the price of lacquer transported to Japan from our country reaches two to three million yuan, accounting for more than 60% of our annual production value. The reason why they need such a huge amount is for the cotton mills, which are necessary for industry. In recent years, Japanese yarn has been sold well all over the world. The wooden tubes used to manufacture 40-count fine yarn must be soaked in boiling water. If the lacquer does not have good durability, the manufacturing ability will be lost. If we can stop the supply of lacquer, we can control the life of Japanese yarn. Now that the new lacquer is about to be released on the market, it is the time to sever economic relations with the Japanese. There is no reason to supply Japanese merchants. However, the merchants in Hankou, such as Chen Yutai, Tong Qixiang, Xinhefu, Liu Yucheng, Yongchang, Chen Wanmei, Yiyuan Chang, Liu Yisheng, Liu Xietai, and Liu Yusheng are willing to please foreigners and have no love for the country, only caring about increasing prices to seek private gain. They still secretly provide the Japanese with new lacquer to Kato, Mizuta, and Tajima, with more than 1,000 pieces being transported to Shanghai to be loaded on ships for export. Now that the Japanese are rampant, when the whole country is determined to resist Japan, these traitors dare to violate public opinion and privately supply the enemy. This is deeply hated. Therefore, we request your association to consult with the Hankou Anti-Japanese Association to investigate and severely punish them to warn the wicked and extend popular outrage. In addition to Hankou, Yichang, Shashi, and Chongqing also have Japanese merchants who go to the interior to purchase new goods every time they are released on the market. Inland merchants have limited knowledge and cannot avoid being lured by profit. We also ask you to consult with the anti-Japanese organizations in these places to strictly prevent and block them. The situation reported is consistent and should be delivered immediately. Please investigate and handle it, and we hope to see a reply." Addressed to the Hankou Anti-Japanese Association.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Should Be Informed That Domestic Dalian Beans Should Be Allowed to Be Sold. Yesterday, It Telegraphed the Yongjia Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, Saying: "To the Yongjia Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, On the 27th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association, the letter from our colleague Qianlai Company said that Dalian beans are produced in the Northeast and are purely domestic goods, without any doubt. Therefore, the transportation and resale are not subject to any interference. However, recently, the Wenzhou Anti-Japanese Association, with a paper strip with the word "Showa" written on the bag, was mistaken for Japanese goods, and was immediately detained and prohibited from being sold. This is a misunderstanding. We are specially examining the two telegrams from the Wenzhou Chamber of Commerce and requesting that they be forwarded to the Wenzhou Chamber of Commerce to clarify the facts in order to correct them and facilitate business. The letter from our colleague Xinfeng Company is roughly the same as the previous one and is attached with the telegram from the Wenzhou Bean and Rice Industry Association. According to this, it is found that Dalian beans are purely domestic products and there is no doubt that the paper strips in the bags are originally used to prove the quality of the goods and have no other function. However, the Wenzhou Anti-Japanese Association regarded the word "Showa" on the storage slip as Japanese goods and detained them, which is a misunderstanding. We are urgently inspecting the original three telegrams and sending a letter to your association to quickly forward the telegram to the Wenzhou Anti-Japanese Association to explain the misunderstanding and release them immediately. In the future, do not leave any difficulties for Dalian beans in order to facilitate business and avoid disputes. According to this, the beans shipped from Dalian are known to be special products of our Northeast, but Dalian is within the sphere of influence of the Japanese. All the beans shipped out must be inspected by the exchange there before they can be shipped. The paper bag with the word "Showa" printed on it is the mark of the exchange's inspection and has no other meaning. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the word "Showa" on the inspection is similar to a Japanese name and is considered a Japanese product. According to the report, we are sending a telegram to your association to ask you to examine it and immediately return all the beans and do not make it difficult for the beans to be transported and sold in the future. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is grateful and prints it."</p>

<p>Stopping the Loading of Japanese Goods to Tianjin Since the boycott, the Yangtze River</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The loading of Japanese goods has been stopped in the region, and the Japanese goods in the Beiyang region can still be used. The Japanese ships Longping, Kyozaki, Chohei, and Tangshan, etc., operating in this port still load and leave as usual. Therefore, in the past two months, Japanese goods from Shanghai to North China have still been exported. Until yesterday, the Japanese shipping companies in this port received a telegram from Tianjin that Jingu would not allow Japanese goods to be loaded and unloaded, and the workers would stop handling them. Please stop loading by various Japanese ships. Therefore, from today onwards, the Japanese ships going to Tianjin from Shanghai dare not load Japanese goods, fearing that they will not be able to unload after arriving at the port, which will limit the navigation of the ships.</p>

<p>There are a total of nine Sino-Japanese ships of the Japanese Post Office in this port. In peacetime, there were the most goods and passengers to and from, and the business was particularly prosperous. Therefore, four temporary ships were often added to operate. Since the boycott, the number of Japanese goods coming to Shanghai has been greatly reduced. The Japanese ships of the Japanese Post Office only loaded a part of American cotton, and there was nothing else. The company received a telegram from Japan yesterday saying that ships such as Tenjo Maru and Tsukuba Maru have been suspended from sailing immediately. Other ships can only reluctantly sail because the Japanese government has subsidies, but each trip will lose one or two thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Due to the Long Delay in Resolving Treatment Conditions</p>
<p>But Electricity and Trams Are Still Supplied as Usual</p>
<p>All the staff of the Huashang Electric Company in this city went on strike at 9:00 AM yesterday due to the obstruction of Wu Quesheng, the chief of the general affairs section, in resolving the treatment conditions. However, trams and electricity are still running and supplied as usual. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Reasons for the Strike <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>All the staff of the Huashang Electric Company had requested to improve their treatment conditions and had submitted conditions. After repeated mediation by party and government agencies, a solution was possible. However, because Wu Quesheng, the chief of the general affairs section of the company, obstructed it, the solution was delayed and there was no way to resolve it. The representatives of all the staff had no choice but to resign to the public. All the staff decided to go on strike to promote awareness. Therefore, starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, all the staff of the lamp affairs, car affairs, general affairs, general affairs, materials, technology, engineering, accounting, and document sections went on strike. However, the staff managed to maintain trams and lights to ensure public services and social security.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Staff Conditions <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>In order to maintain order, all staff organized a maintenance committee and elected Ding Hanqing, Ding Jianshi, Lin Yiyun, Ma Chenglong, Zhang Yinzhi, Wang Juncai, Xu Shijun, Du Chengen, Zhan Chengxiang, Yang Siyuan, Wu Youren, Zhou Yongfang, Zhang Wenheng, Wang Jiaxiang, and Shao Changchun as the persons in charge. Therefore, the order was very good yesterday. According to the resolution of the general assembly, (1) Wu Quesheng, who sabotaged labor-management cooperation, was expelled, and (2) the amended conditions of the municipal party department were fulfilled. If the goal is not achieved, they will not work.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Representative Resignations <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Urgent Statement from the Representatives of All Employees of the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company, Resigning Their Positions: We, the entire staff of the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company, requested that the company improve our treatment. The Social Affairs Bureau repeatedly, along with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Utilities Bureau, dispatched personnel to convene talks between labor and management to mediate. The representatives, considering the impending national crisis, hoped for an early resolution and unity against external threats, and thus made concessions step by step, all of which are recorded and verifiable. On the 17th of this month, at 1:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau again, along with representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau, convened talks between labor and management. The Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Pan, personally handled the matter, and on the spot, the conditions for improved treatment proposed by the employees were discussed and decided upon item by item. These were recorded on the spot by Zhang Zhenyuan, a clerk from the Social Affairs Bureau committee, and representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau were responsible for providing testimony. The representatives believed that the issue of improved treatment, which had been in dispute for half a year, could thus be considered concluded. Unexpectedly, on October 23rd, the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order and a set of implementation measures for the treatment, which completely altered all the clauses agreed upon at that time, completely inconsistent with the original agreement. Upon seeing this document, all the employees were extremely indignant and questioned the representatives, inquiring about the outcome of the previous discussions and the reported results, and why they were so different from the measures approved by the Bureau this time. Impatient individuals even denounced the representatives, questioning their credibility and character. The representatives, bearing this undeserved grievance, were unable to defend themselves. Regarding the Social Affairs Bureau's failure to follow the agreed-upon clauses, without consulting the employee representatives and the Municipal Party Headquarters, and arbitrarily altering the treatment measures, the representatives absolutely cannot recognize them and hereby resign from their representative positions to apologize to all the employees. All subsequent proceedings and matters will be directly discussed and handled by all the employees. The representatives bear no further responsibility. We hereby solemnly declare: Shao Shuping, Song Zhonghe, Sun Zhifei, Tan Zitang, Zhu Yan, Shen Yulin, Liu Xuekun, Zhu Wenlong, Shen Yuping, Du Ning, together.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Authorities Intervene <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order yesterday to stop the matter, stating: In compliance with the order, it is reported that the employees suddenly went on strike en masse on the 28th of this month and misunderstood the Bureau's decision on treatment measures, openly slandering the Bureau, which is extremely inappropriate. Upon investigation, the measures decided by the Bureau were a compromise reached after assessing the situation of both parties. If the employees have any grievances, they can file an appeal with the Municipal Government, which is the proper procedure. However, during this time of national crisis, they have resorted to strikes as a means of coercion, which is a deliberate violation of the law. It is hereby ordered that work be resumed immediately and that an appeal be filed directly with the government, without further insistence, to avoid incurring blame. This order is imperative.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Report to the Municipal Government <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau submitted a report to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: Report on the matter of petitioning. This Bureau received a report stating that Deng Shuping and other employees of the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company suddenly went on strike on the 28th of this month and publicly published a statement slandering the government. Upon investigation, a dispute arose over the employees' request for the company to improve their treatment. This Bureau, together with relevant agencies, repeatedly dispatched personnel to convene interviews and impartially decided on nine measures to resolve the points of contention between the two parties, and separately ordered compliance, which was submitted to Your Excellency's government for approval and filing. Now, after reading the published statements of the employees, they stated, "Director Pan personally handled the matter, and on the spot, the conditions for improved treatment proposed by the employees were discussed and decided upon item by item." "Unexpectedly, upon issuing the order and the implementation measures for the treatment, all the clauses agreed upon at that time were completely altered, completely inconsistent with the original agreement," etc. This is greatly misunderstood in comparison to the situation in which separate advice was given at the time. The employees' requests were only for the Director's reference in advising the management, and conversely, the management's statements were also only for the Director's reference in advising the labor side. There was absolutely no agreement reached with either party under the form of conversation. The details are all recorded and verifiable. However, it is heard that the employees are dissatisfied with the fact that the management did not agree to the salary increase in October, and the Bureau's decision was to start the increase in October of the 20th year. Regarding the amount of the salary increase, the employees are also dissatisfied with the level of "36 yuan or more, a 30% increase" in the two levels from 20 yuan or more to 50 yuan or more. This is hearsay, and what their true intention is has not been reported. In short, the Director handled this case as a dispute between the employees of a public utility and the company, and failed to mediate it according to the Law on Handling Labor Disputes. He only solicited the opinions of both parties, advised them accordingly, and sought a compromise solution in the midst of mutual contention. If the employees are dissatisfied with the decision, they can file another appeal. Now, they are inciting strikes and arbitrarily coercing, which is extremely inappropriate. Regarding the matter of the strike of public utility employees, it is appropriate to submit a written report on the handling of this case, together with a copy of the records of the repeated interviews, for Your Excellency's government to review and quickly convene both parties for a decision to avoid disputes. The entire set of records is also requested to be returned after the handling is completed, which is a matter of public convenience. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>After all the employees of the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company went on strike, General Manager Lu Bohong convened a meeting of all section chiefs at 10:00 AM yesterday, and reported the details of the incident to the Public Utilities Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau for legal processing. At 7:00 PM, he convened a joint emergency meeting at the United Association headquarters on Beijing Road to discuss everything.</p>

<p>After all the employees of the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company went on strike, the Municipal Party Headquarters was deeply concerned that the prolongation of the strike would affect the operation of streetcars and the activation of electricity, and would have a significant impact on social security and transportation. In order to find a way to resolve the situation quickly, it specially dispatched Zhao Bingchang, a cadre from the Civil Training Section, to conduct a thorough investigation of the truth and report it, so that it could be handled in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau also sent Guo Yongxi to conduct a thorough investigation last night.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Worker Assistance <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>All the workers of the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company, in view of the fact that all the employees were subjected to unreasonable oppression by the management and had no choice but to go on strike automatically, expressed their assistance and willingness to serve as a backing. Last night, slogans were posted all over the streetcars: (1) Expel Wu Quesheng, (2) Assist the employees to victory, (3) All workers unanimously support the union, (4) Support all union directors and supervisors, (5) Implement treatment regulations and agreements.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Union Statement <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Guangrong, the standing director of the First District Water and Electricity Industry, expressed his opinion to the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday regarding the employee strike, saying that his union has absolutely no relationship with the Employee Friendship Association. Moreover, in the past, when workers had disputes over treatment conditions, the employees never assisted us. Therefore, the union will not provide assistance to the employees in this strike. However, all the workers, because Wu Quesheng undermined the labor movement, expressed their sympathy to the employees. This is an automatic action by the workers, and the union is trying to persuade them. If the employee strike is prolonged, it is feared that there will be no streetcar tickets for sale tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Anti-Drug Association Protests Opium Planting in Fujian <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Public Telegrams from Southern Fujian</p>
<p>Local Officials Force Planting and Tax Collection</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has received numerous telegrams and letters from public organizations in southern Fujian in recent days, reporting that local military and political personnel are sheltering opium seedlings and collecting land taxes. The Anti-Drug Association is deeply saddened. It is now compiling the facts and protesting to the central government and the Fujian provincial government, and plans to unite with various Fujian public organizations in Shanghai to urge them to quickly eradicate the opium and severely punish local officials who violate the prohibition laws. It is heard that the Xiamen National Anti-Drug Association has repeatedly sent telegrams to report, but they have been inspected and withheld by the local authorities, which shows the local authorities' guilt. Yesterday, another urgent telegram was received, the original text of which is as follows: To the Shanghai Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, it has recently been reported that Zhangzhou and Tong'an are planting opium seedlings on a large scale. Zhang Zhen went to the countryside to encourage planting, and the opium taxes are collected by the Finance Department and Chen Zhijun, Lin Zhe, and Chen Qiyu. Tong'an has subcontracted to Ye Xihuang and Battalion Commander Chen Kun at a price of 1.2 million yuan, nominally for field tax. Zhangzhou is nominally for tax deed fields, and the tax comes from opium seeds. Farmers are required to exchange cash. Zhangzhou has implemented a public sale of opium paste, which is contracted by Hong Zhemin, using the name of opium lamp tax. Each regiment of the military also distributes 100 taels of opium per month for sale. The opium seedlings in Quanzhou and Putian are definitely a cooperation between Fang Shengtao and Chen Guohui. We sincerely request that the central government severely punish them or send personnel to inspect them on the ground to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Xiamen Anti-Drug Association. In addition, various mass organizations of farmers, workers, merchants, and students from Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Anhai have also sent telegrams in recent days, requesting the Anti-Drug Association to request the government to quickly stop the opium seedlings. Excerpts from the telegrams are as follows: (1) Since last year, Nan'an, Hui'an, Datian, Yongchun, Dehua, Tong'an, and other counties have reserved poppies to collect opium, and Chen Guohui and Zhang Zhen have collected donations. This year is even worse. Now, the Tong'an County has dispatched Chen Kun's special task battalion to donate 1.2 million yuan with the county. Most of Nan'an, Jinjiang, Hui'an, and other places have planted. (2) Opium seedlings have been planted in Jinjiang, Nan'an, Anxi, Yongchun, Hui'an, Tong'an, and other counties this season. After the floods and wars, if we do not pay attention to the production of food crops, the local area will be disturbed. What will become of us? (3) The opium seedlings in southern Fujian have been planted this season, a hundred times more than last year. The provincial government has indeed collected donations for opium seedlings. The stationed army also verbally reported that the opium seedlings in Quanzhou will be donated this season, with 1.2 million yuan determined by merchants, and a special bureau has been established.</p>

<p>Shenyang Postmaster is Italian</p>
<p>Japanese Dare Not Interfere with Postal Service</p>
<p>After the Japanese incident, the postal service in the Northeast was once blocked due to being under the iron heel of the violent Japanese. At times it was open and at times it was blocked. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with Xu Shifang, the secretary and director of the Postal Administration, yesterday, and was told that the Northeast postal service has recently been able to operate without hindrance, because the postmaster in Shenyang is now an Italian. The violent Japanese have reservations about him and therefore dare not interfere with the postal service. However, the Japanese army must inspect the mail to and from the area, and any related letters will be detained.</p>

<p>Jianghua Collides with Sand Boat The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River liner Jianghua collided with a sand boat near Wuhu while en route from Hankou to Shanghai. The Jianghua needed to dock at the Wuhu wharf as usual. As the Jianghua was approaching the port, a sand boat was sailing in front of the Wuhu Customs. The Jianghua was larger and came with greater momentum. The ship's body collided with the sand boat, immediately destroying it. The sand boat sank into the river. Fortunately, the boatman was rescued. Since the incident, both parties have reported to the Wuhu Customs Supervisor, who has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the responsibility for the accident in order to compensate for the loss. The matter is currently under negotiation.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Shanghai County Police Academy Held Inspection Yesterday <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The first phase of police cadets in Shanghai County has long since graduated and been assigned to various district public security bureaus for apprenticeship. The second phase of police cadets is being actively trained. County Magistrate Yan believes that the police are an essential element in ensuring local security. Training is not considered to be too strict or comprehensive. Therefore, he usually pays great attention to the police training. Yesterday, the police cadets held an inspection. At 9:00 AM, all the police cadets, fully armed, gathered in the drill ground. At the sound of a bugle, the entire field stood in silence. First, a military parade was held. County Magistrate Yan inspected the entire team and walked around once. Then, the instructor gave the order to salute. All the police cadets paid their respects and paid attention. The military appearance was solemn and the movements were agile. Then, the order was issued to drill. The steps were neat. After the drill, County Magistrate Yan gave a speech, saying that the police have a close relationship with the people of society. If you do not cultivate your own personality, it is difficult to correct the bad habits of the people of society. The book says, "If one's own person is upright, he can rule without command; if his own person is not upright, even with command, he will not be obeyed." At this time of national crisis, it is even more important for everyone to cultivate their personality and work hard for the country. As a police officer, being able to fulfill one's responsibilities in one's own position is being a good police officer, which is the way to save the country. Then, Director Ye and Security Section Chief Yao Gongzhi spoke in succession. Then, they practiced judo, and Chief Inspector Xu led the entire team to set off for a parade. This Friday, the team will be led to Chenxing, Sanlintang, and other places to conduct field exercises.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Detailed Report on the Zhenru Train Collision <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>More than 30 Passengers Injured</p>
<p>Lu Zhichuan's Wife Most Severely Injured</p>
<p>All Trains Have Resumed Normal Operation</p>
<p>Those Responsible for the Accident Suspended Pending Investigation</p>
<p>The previous report briefly described the collision between the 207th freight train and the 10th passenger train on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway at Zhenru Station. It is now known that the cause of the collision was very complicated. The details are described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Cause of the Train Collision <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>At 9:46 PM last night, the 202nd down freight train from Nanjing to Shanghai was stopped on the straight track at Zhenru Station. Because the Meigen Road Station was preparing to dispatch the 207th up freight train and had already obtained the road sign from Zhenru Station, Zhenru Station detained the 202nd freight train to wait for the 207th train. After the 207th freight train arrived at Zhenru Station at 10:03 and stopped properly on the bay track, the 202nd freight train was released from Zhenru to Meigen Road. However, the 10th express train and the 4th passenger train from Nanjing to Shanghai had also departed from Nanxiang and Anting stations. The 207th freight train had no chance to be released. The stationmaster detained the freight train and prepared to release it after meeting the two passenger trains. Unexpectedly, Wu Shengorong, the switchman of the western branch track of the station, saw that the 207th train had met the 202nd train at the station and assumed that the 207th train should be released to Nanxiang. He did not wait for the stationmaster's hand signal and immediately switched the track to the bay track for the 202nd train to pass through. At that time, the stationmaster was the substitute stationmaster Yang Wenyi, who was teaching the tenth train road sign to Nanxiang Station in the office and reporting the train schedule. When the signal from Nanxiang Station that the tenth train had left Nanxiang Station was received, he routinely instructed the porter Lian Asan to turn down the signal flag to let the train enter the station. However, the switchman Wu Shengorong in the switch shed did not pay attention to the signal flag being turned down, and that the track he had switched was for the bay track. When the stationmaster discovered that the track was switched incorrectly, he quickly blew the whistle and signaled to switch it to the straight track. But at that time, the tenth train had already entered the Zhenru Station outside the signal flag and was about to reach the signal flag switch. Although the switchman discovered it, it was too late. Therefore, the tenth train entered the bay track, and at the same time, the 207th freight train, which had stopped on the bay track, had no headlights. Therefore, the driver of the tenth train did not pay attention. When the train approached, he immediately braked, but the momentum was too great to stop immediately, and this unfortunate accident occurred at 10:30.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Train Cars Overturned <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>When the two trains collided, the sound shook the fields. Fortunately, the 207th freight train was not moving, which was already a great fortune. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable. When the 207th train was hit, the rear part of the B-38 locomotive immediately fell into the track. The two coal cars behind the locomotive immediately jumped out, overturned, and fell into the straight track. On the tenth train, only the C-13 locomotive was completely trapped in the track. All the window glass of the second-class car behind the locomotive was shattered by the severe shock, and many of the seats and tables in the car collapsed. The light luggage on the car frame also fell down, making the car extremely messy. A total of eight rails and more than forty sleepers were destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Passengers Injured <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tenth train was on time. Most passengers were organizing their belongings as they approached Shanghai. When the two trains collided, the momentum was too strong, and they all fainted and fell due to the shock. Some were injured by tables and chairs, some were injured by mutual collisions, some were injured by glass, and some were injured by falling objects. A total of about 30 people were injured. The car was covered in bloodstains, and groans were endless. Among them, the wife of Lu Zhichuan, who was coming to Shanghai from Suzhou, was the most seriously injured in the abdomen. Five waiters and one cook in the kitchen of the car, and a passenger named Cai Meizhang who boarded the train in Wanlin, were all injured in the head. The waiter Feng Jujin and the passenger Yan Dehou were both injured in the legs. The train conductor of the tenth train, Fei Bangyan, suffered a scalp abrasion. More than 20 other passengers suffered minor injuries to their hands and feet, or waist and chest pain. There was also a soldier who was seriously injured in the chest.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Great Rescue <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The accident site was near Jinan University. When the Boy Scouts of the school heard the news, they rushed to the scene of the accident to check. Seeing that the passengers were injured and the railway medical officer had not yet arrived, they quickly returned to the school, brought medicine, bandaged the injured passengers in the car, and maintained order. The spirit of chivalry was admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Railway Bureau Rescue <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>After the accident, the Railway Bureau immediately dispatched senior officials from the Traffic Department to find a way to drag out the rescue car and notify the railway doctor and all the craftsmen. They departed together on the rescue car at 1:40 AM yesterday morning. A single locomotive was dispatched to Zhenru in advance to drag the vehicles of the 207th freight train that were not affected back to Meigen Road. The rescue car arrived at Zhenru at 1:55 AM. The officials immediately divided the work. First, they rescued the injured and sent them to various hospitals. Those who did not want to go to the hospital were sent to the North Station. Then, they quickly lifted the two coal cars that had fallen into the straight track and cleared the coal to clear the straight track. At 3:20 AM yesterday morning, the straight track was cleared. The tenth train was withdrawn from the bay track and advanced to the straight track. Another locomotive was dispatched to drag it back to the North Station at 3:40 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Traffic Situation <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>After the accident, obstacles occurred on the way, so the trains could not travel to and fro. The night train from Nanjing to Beijing at 11:45 PM was delayed until 4:53 AM yesterday morning to leave the North Station, a delay of five hours. The night train from Beijing to Shanghai arrived at port at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The fourth special express train from Beijing to Shanghai at 4:00 PM the day before was delayed until 4:20 AM yesterday morning to arrive at the North Station. Now, the bay track at Zhenru Station has been severely damaged and cannot be repaired immediately. However, the straight track can still be used normally. Therefore, all trains have returned to normal yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Aftermath <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news, the station master's side was indeed at fault in this incident, but the track switchman's unauthorized handling of train schedules, disregarding signals, was the biggest cause of the accident. At the same time, the No. 207 freight train's locomotive did not have a headlight, making it impossible to distinguish, which was also inappropriate. Otherwise, the collision would not have been so severe. Currently, all involved parties in the case have been temporarily suspended from their positions by the Railway Bureau and are awaiting interrogation in Shanghai. Once the truth is revealed, further action will be taken.</p>
<h3 id="e155">American Attitude Towards the Noulens Case <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Dewey and Others Jointly Protest</p>
<p>Request Madam Soong Ching-ling to Find a Way to Rescue</p>
<p>After the news of the Noulens couple, previously believed to be representatives of the Pan-Pacific Trade Union headquarters and members of the Communist Party, being sentenced to death in Nanjing, reached the United States via telegram, prominent Americans were greatly shocked. These prominent figures, who are usually engaged in the protection of people's private and public rights, sent a joint telegram to the Nanjing National Government and another telegram to Madam Soong Ching-ling on October 24, protesting the shocking verdict. The signatories included Clarence Darrow, Theodore Dreiser, Louis Gannett, Norman Thomas, Louis Untermeyer, John Dewey, and others. Darrow is a famous Chicago lawyer and a free thinker who often uses the American spirit of freedom enshrined in the American Declaration of Independence as his fundamental concept. In the past twenty-five years, he has been known in the United States as a protector of workers and political prisoners. In famous American trials of workers, he was almost always the leading defense lawyer, and was thus honored with the title of "Protector of Labor." Dreiser is one of America's two great writers, author of many novels. Europeans mostly regard him as America's greatest literary figure. He is the author of *Genius*, *Sister Carrie*, and many short stories. His recent book, *An American Tragedy*, is currently being shown on Shanghai screens. Gannett is also a free thinker who traveled extensively to major cities in China five years ago and is the editor of the famous New York-based *The Nation*. He currently writes for the *New York Herald Tribune*. Baldwin is the secretary-general of the American Civil Liberties Union, a national organization whose mission is to protect the freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and the right to strike for all people through newspapers and lawyers. Baldwin is a pacifist and also a free thinker. Dewey is a famous educator and philosopher, currently a professor at Columbia University. His theories are well known in universities in China that have educational programs, so there is no need for a detailed introduction.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Husband Returns to Clan, Wife Disagrees <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhongen Has Returned to the Hua Clan</p>
<p>His Wife Sues to Establish Her Status</p>
<p>Does the Wife's Status Depend on Her Husband's?</p>
<p>Court Scheduled to Pronounce Judgment on the 31st</p>
<p>Lu Dongsen, a native of Dinghai residing at 227 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, was old-fashioned, so he ordered his son Zhongen, who had also come of age and was working for the Municipal Council, to marry Kang Xindi as his wife. They officially married last year and now have a son. Unexpectedly, Lu Dongsen and his son suddenly had a falling out this spring and became involved in a lawsuit. Lu claimed that Zhongen was not his biological son and requested permission to sever their father-son relationship. After the first instance judgment, one party was dissatisfied and appealed. The second division of the Jiangsu High Court summoned both parties to court for questioning. As a result, Lu Dongsen was granted permission to sever his father-son relationship with Lu Zhongen, and Lu Dongsen was ordered to pay Lu Zhongen 800 yuan within three months. Since then, Zhongen has reverted to his original Hua surname. However, Zhongen's wife, Kang Xindi, claimed that since her husband had returned to his clan, she had not agreed to it beforehand. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit against her father-in-law, Lu Dongsen, to establish her status and requested that the defendant, Lu Dongsen, return the gifted property he was holding in trust. According to Kang's complaint, in 1923, when she was fifteen years old, her parents betrothed her to Zhongen, the son of the defendant Lu Dongsen. In April 1925, after the death of her aunt-in-law, Lu Zhao, the defendant followed the customs of his hometown and welcomed her into the family to observe mourning and filial piety. He also gave her a portion of her aunt's belongings as a gift. At that time, she was still young and had no ability to manage them, so she handed them over to the defendant to hold in trust. In 1930, she officially married the defendant's son, Lu Zhongen, and soon gave birth to a son named Lu Painan, who is not yet one year old. In the spring of this year, the defendant and his son suddenly became involved in a lawsuit. The defendant claimed that Zhongen was the son of Hua Shen and was adopted by the defendant when he was young. In the second instance, they reached a settlement. Zhongen admitted to severing his father-son relationship with the defendant and returning to the Hua surname. However, she was not consulted about the case beforehand or afterward, and the settlement resulted in her and her son Painan changing their surnames and leaving the Lu family to become members of the Hua family. She believes that her previously acquired name rights and Lu family status should be protected by Article 083 of the Civil Code. She has requested mediation, but the defendant refused. Therefore, she has filed a lawsuit requesting a judgment: (1) Confirming Lu Kang Xindi's status as Lu Dongsen's daughter-in-law; (2) Confirming Lu Painan as Lu Dongsen's grandson; (3) Lu Dongsen should return the entrusted items according to the list; (4) The defendant should bear the costs of this lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang opened the court to examine the case. In addition to the two parties, Hua Zhongen (i.e., Lu Zhongen) was also summoned to testify. First, the plaintiff stated the reasons for the lawsuit. Then, the defendant provided rebuttal, stating that it was because Zhongen's character was too poor and he had no respect for his elders that they severed their father-son relationship. As for the surname of the daughter-in-law, it should naturally follow her husband. Moreover, her son was born in her mother's home, so he cannot be recognized as a grandson. He also denied the other requests of the plaintiff. Later, the plaintiff's lawyer, Li Shiwei, and the defendant's lawyer, Liu, debated each other based on the law. Lawyer Li argued that although the law does not stipulate that the consent of the spouse is required for an adopted son to return to his clan, if it hinders the rights of a third party, then it is necessary to request legal protection. Moreover, what was severed was the relationship of an adopted son, not an adopted daughter-in-law or adopted grandson, so the status of the plaintiff and her son should be confirmed. The plaintiff is a weak woman, and Painan is still in swaddling clothes. Their future life cannot be supported by Zhongen and must rely on the defendant. Lawyer Liu argued that the wife should follow her husband. After both sides finished their arguments, Judge Yang adjourned the court and scheduled the judgment for the 31st of this month.</p>

<p>Wu Yantian Accuses Wife of Attempted Murder</p>
<p>Bian Shi Firmly Denies</p>
<p>Wu Yantian, a coppersmith from Nanjing residing at 316 Ruijin Road, has been constantly arguing with his wife, Bian Shi (age 31), due to financial difficulties. Around 10 AM yesterday morning, Wu Yantian planned to marry off his eleven-year-old daughter to a certain family as a child bride. Bian Shi did not agree, and another argument ensued. After a while, Bian Shi went out to buy 200 *wen* worth of fresh noodles and brought them home to cook for lunch, adding a little bit of vegetables. After they were cooked, they were divided into three bowls, and the couple and their daughter ate them one after another. Wu felt that the noodles tasted strange while he was eating. After he finished eating, noodle soup suddenly flowed out of his mouth and dripped on the table. Upon inspection, it was mercury. He carefully looked at the remaining juice at the bottom of the bowl and found traces of the substance. He then questioned Bian Shi, "Did you put this poisonous substance in here to try to murder me?" Bian Shi denied it, and another argument ensued. Wu immediately reported the incident to the Harbin Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Peng Yushan and Western detective McLaren to take Bian Shi and the noodle bowl to the police station, where she was transferred to the women's prison. At the same time, Wu Yantian was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Wu Bian Shi to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, presented the case and stated that the victim, Wu Yantian, was fortunate to have only been slightly poisoned. After treatment by doctors, his life was not in danger. He was present in court to be questioned. Chinese detective Peng Yushan reported that after the incident, he had investigated the noodle shop that Bian Shi had mentioned, and there was no mercury mixed in. He then presented the large bowl Wu had used to eat the noodles at the time for inspection. The victim, Wu Yantian, stated that he used to be a patrol officer and now worked as a coppersmith. He has been married to Bian Shi for eleven years and has two daughters. The couple's relationship was good in the past, but recently, due to a declining livelihood and financial difficulties, Bian Shi often argued with him. He had mentioned the matter of marrying off his eleven-year-old daughter as a child bride to someone several times before, but it had not yet been carried out. He then described the events in detail. When questioned, Wu Bian Shi stated that she had been married to Wu for eleven years and that he often quarreled with her. Yesterday morning, he wanted to marry off their eleven-year-old daughter to someone as a child bride. She did not agree, and another argument ensued. He said, "If you like someone, you can follow them immediately, but you have to give me money." As for the mercury in the noodles, it was actually a false accusation by him. If she wanted to murder him, she would have done it long ago. Why wait eleven years? She asked for a fair judgment. After examining the statements, Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered Wu Bian Shi to be detained for further investigation and interrogation.</p>

<p>Letter to Charity Champagne Winner for Aid</p>
<p>Brief News from the Provincial Flood Relief Committees. The following is a report on the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for the Provincial Flood Disaster Relief Fund: "Soliciting aid from the Charity Champagne Winner." The committee sent a letter yesterday to Xu Wenliang and others, the winners of the Charity Champagne: "Mr. Wenliang, esteemed sir, Greetings. The purpose of launching this Charity Champagne campaign was to raise emergency relief funds for disaster victims. We have received enthusiastic support from people from all walks of life, who have competed to purchase tickets, resulting in breaking the historical record of various horse racing champagne events at sea. This enthusiastic and righteous act is admired by both Chinese and foreigners. The public lottery was held on the 25th of this month. We learned that your esteemed company, Shifuqing, won the top prize. Although you gentlemen have been compassionate and generous in providing disaster relief and have not sought any reward, good fortune always comes to those who do good deeds. Now that the harsh winter is approaching, the disaster victims in various provinces are exposed to the elements in single layers of clothing, suffering from hunger and cold. Even if the floodwaters recede and they return to their hometowns, their houses and belongings have been washed away. The situation is extremely pitiful and in need of assistance. We have long admired your compassion for disaster relief. We are sending this special letter to sincerely request you to show great mercy and generously donate a large sum of money, or designate it for cotton clothing, or designate it for setting up porridge kitchens. Our committee will follow your instructions and do our best to handle it sincerely. On behalf of the seventy million disaster victims, we bow deeply and await your reply with great anticipation. " "Standing Committee Meeting to be Held Today." The committee sent a letter to each member of the standing committee yesterday: "Esteemed Sir, Greetings. Our committee is scheduled to hold the fourteenth meeting of the standing committee at 4 PM on Thursday, the 29th of this month. We are sending this letter to inform you and hope that you will attend the meeting on time. " "Please Allocate More Cotton Clothing to Henan Province." The committee received a telegram yesterday from Feng Yangshan, the Henan Province Relief Commissioner in Qinyang: "Received the telegram that you are providing cotton clothing, greatly appreciated. However, there are many disaster victims in Henan Province. Please allocate more to the province." "Severe Disaster in Zhechuan, Please Provide Relief." The committee received a telegram yesterday from the Zhechuan County Government and Relief Committee in Henan: "Our county has been severely affected by the disaster. Neither official nor voluntary relief efforts have reached us. Please provide relief."</p>
<h3 id="e159">National Medical Association Benefits Disaster Victims <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Medical Association previously formed medical teams to treat disaster victims at the refugee shelters in shifts every day and assigned resident doctors to take responsibility for managing the treatment. Since the establishment of the medical teams, they have achieved excellent results. In addition to voluntarily providing medical treatment, each team member also works with all members of the association to raise funds to cover the daily drug expenses of 100 yuan. The Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Industry Association also donated 600 yuan to subsidize drug expenses. The following is a statistical table of the team's treatment of disaster victims in the past half month: Diarrhea: 608 people; cold and congestion: 330 people; cold: 323 people; swelling: 194 people; tuberculosis: 141 people; food stagnation: 139 people; sores and toxins: 125 people; chest pain: 73 people; postpartum: 68 people; measles: 32 people; eye diseases: 21 people; vomiting: 15 people; scrofula: 14 people; jaundice: 13 people; oral thrush: 13 people; phlegm and fluid retention: 13 people; nicotine addiction: 9 people; asthma: 8 people; throat diseases: 8 people; wind diseases: 8 people; carbuncles: 5 people; palpitations: 4 people; constipation: 4 people; cholera: 4 people; convulsions: 4 people; hernia: 2 people; hemorrhoids: 2 people; stroke: 1 person; consumption: 1 person; lower back pain: 1 person; toothache: 1 person; night sweats: 1 person; loss of voice: 1 person; dysphagia: 1 person. The total number of visits, including follow-up visits, was 2222. The number of deaths was: diarrhea: 2; stroke: 1; typhoid fever: 1; cold: 1. According to the report of Hu Fu, a doctor from the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the most common diseases among disaster victims were typhoid fever, damp-heat syndrome, diarrhea, swelling, and colds. Among them, ascites is caused by prolonged immersion in water and is the most difficult to treat. Disaster victims suffer from illness because their clothing and bedding are thin and they cannot keep warm, which makes it difficult for them to recover quickly. It is hoped that philanthropists in this city will donate clothing and bedding to help with the relief efforts. It is reported that Mr. Hu himself has already raised more than 300 newly made cotton garments from Mr. Ni Zhenxiang. Yesterday, he sent them to the office and personally distributed them to the disaster-stricken children along with Jiang Youcheng and other staff from the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Unfortunately, the number was small and could not be distributed to everyone.</p>

<p>There are 1,035 male children and 774 female children, totaling 1,810 children, in the flood-stricken children's shelter on Liu Lin Road in this city. They are in great need of assistance in terms of both material and intellectual resources. Currently, children in the East District Elementary School and North District Elementary School of the Shanghai Municipal Council, under the guidance of educator Chen Heqin and other faculty members, have saved the money given to them by their parents for snacks and spending money to provide assistance and express their sympathy. Yesterday, representatives elected by the children of the two schools sent a total of 312 yuan in silver dollars, 1,212 yuan in silver coins, and 355 copper coins, totaling 431 yuan and 37 cents, to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association at 20 Museum Road. They entrusted the association to customize several sets of children's clothing and shoes for distribution and to hire two full-time teachers to conduct children's education work in the disaster-stricken children's shelter. Such compassionate children are truly model children of the new China. The patient and dedicated guidance of Mr. Chen and other faculty members is particularly invaluable.</p>

<p>After hearing that Mr. Simpson, the great philanthropist dispatched by the League of Nations to handle disaster relief matters in China, had arrived in Shanghai, Ms. Baker, a member of the Hubei Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, flew from Hankou to Shanghai yesterday. She arrived at the port at about 3 PM and immediately met with Simpson. In addition to reporting on the current situation of the disaster in Wuhan, they also discussed relief methods until they dispersed at about 5 PM. According to Simpson's entourage, Simpson was originally scheduled to travel to Hankou by boat today (the 29th) to inspect the disaster situation. However, now that Baker has arrived in Shanghai, he has a clear understanding of the disaster situation there, so it is no longer necessary to go to Hankou. Moreover, he has been entrusted by Finance Minister Song to act as the deputy secretary-general, directing all the work of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee. The matter is complicated and the responsibility is heavy, so he has no time to leave. Therefore, the trip to Hankou has been canceled. However, if necessary, he may still make a trip to Hankou, which is also unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e163">New Regulations on the Elimination of Obstructions on Sidewalks <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Promulgated by the Municipal Council</p>
<p>In view of the increasing number of sidewalks obstructed by permanent or movable objects, the Municipal Council has now decided that the following regulations must be strictly observed in the future. In the past, there have been many violators who were ordered by the Municipal Council to remove wooden signs placed on the sidewalk or to raise tents that were hanging low over the sidewalk, but the obstructions were soon returned to their original locations. Therefore, general measures are hereby formulated to eliminate such obstructions. However, in order to allow shop owners and others sufficient time to comply with the new regulations, these measures will be implemented from January 1, 1932. At that time, the Municipal Council will exercise the powers conferred by Clause 23 of the Land Regulations to implement the following new regulations: (1) Tents or parts thereof shall not be installed at a height of less than seven feet six inches above the sidewalk or at a height of less than fifteen feet above the road surface; (2) No fixtures, stalls, stands or other movable objects shall be placed in front of any building in such a way as to protrude onto the sidewalk or roadway.</p>
<p>Clause 23 of the Land Regulations provides that if any porch, veranda, awning, casement, steps, cellar, cellar door or window, wooden or iron sign, shelf, shutter, wall, fence or any other projecting object, whether constructed or placed, protrudes from any building or in front of any building within the boundary and is sufficient to obstruct the safety and passage of the road, the Council may notify the occupant of the building to remove or reconstruct the obstruction. The occupant shall remove or reconstruct the object in accordance with the Council's instructions within fourteen days of receipt of the notice. If the occupant fails to do so, the Council may impose a fine of up to ten dollars and remove the obstruction on his behalf. The cost of removal shall be borne by the occupant and may be recovered by way of damages. However, if the obstruction was created or installed by the owner, the cost of removal paid by the occupant may be deducted from the rent.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Lawsuit Regarding the Biography of Wu King Zhang Shicheng <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Han Zishi Wrote a Book About a Local Sage</p>
<p>Zhao Nangong Breached the Contract and Did Not Publish It</p>
<p>Zhang Shicheng, the Wu King at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, was originally from Taixian, Jiangsu Province. When Zhang ruled the three Wu regions, he was known for his political achievements and left a legacy of love among the people. Han Zishi, a former Jiangsu Province official, regarded Zhang as an elder from his hometown. He collected local literature and wrote a biography, which he completed last June. Through the introduction of Zhao Yuansheng, an employee of the Nanshi Electric Company in this city, Han handed over the manuscript to Zhao Nangong, the manager of the Taidong Bookstore on the Fourth Avenue, to negotiate the printing. They agreed on the cost of labor and materials and signed a contract, setting a deadline for delivery. However, Zhao repeatedly delayed the delivery. Therefore, Han entrusted lawyers Zhu Shaowen and Zhu Dianqing to file a petition with the mediation office of the First Special District Court for mediation. The petition is recorded as follows: "For breach of contract and damages, requesting mediation to order performance within a time limit or termination of the contract and return of funds. The petitioner, on June 18 of last year, through the introduction of Zhao Yuansheng, handed over the Wu King Zhang Shicheng biography written by the petitioner to the Taidong Bookstore managed by the opposing party for printing. The opposing party issued a quotation list, totaling 1,685 yuan. It was agreed that the petitioner would pay 40% and the opposing party would pay 60%, and each would receive 500 copies of the book. It was agreed that the book would be completed within one month. The petitioner paid the 40%, totaling 674 yuan, in full. Unexpectedly, a lawsuit suddenly occurred at the printing press of the bookstore. The paper plates that had been made were taken away. The petitioner repeatedly urged the opposing party, who first said that they were investigating, and then said that they had been taken away by the landlord. After urging for half a year, the book was still not printed. The petitioner had no choice but to request your court to summon the opposing party to mediate, ordering them to perform the contract within a time limit, or terminate the contract, compensate for the deposit and manuscript, and clear the formalities. We look forward to this very much." This case will be summoned for mediation between the two parties soon.</p>
<h3 id="e165">A Young Man in a Suit Commits Fraudulent Acts <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Deceives Wang Kunli to Obtain Medicine</p>
<p>Deceives Chen Xishan to Obtain Telegram</p>
<p>Deceives Wang's Mother to Give 30 Yuan</p>
<p>Discovered and Escapes, Then Captured</p>
<p>Chen Xishan, a 36-year-old Henan native, resides at 29 Xianxian Lane, Hujun Camp, Nanshi. Chen has a cousin, Wang Kunli, who resides at Chen's place. The woman is currently 29 years old. Her father, Wang Xiqing, works as a locomotive mechanic at the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Station. Yesterday morning, he went to Hangzhou by train. Around 2 PM, a young man wearing a fancy suit suddenly visited Chen's home to see Wang Kunli. Chen happened to be sleeping upstairs, so Wang came out to greet him. The young man said that her father, Wang Xiqing, had gone to Hangzhou on official business this morning and was hit by a train in Jiaxing, injuring his waist severely and potentially endangering his life. Wang was shocked to hear this, as if struck by lightning. The young man continued, "Now, you don't need to panic. You should quickly go to my friend Zhao Jintian's house at 39 Fuhe Lane near the Great World in the northern part of the city and ask Zhao for a bottle of wound medicine. Because this medicine has miraculous effects when applied to wounds. After you get the medicine, quickly come back and take the 3 o'clock express train with me to Jiaxing to accompany your father back to Shanghai." Wang, anxious about her father, did not bother to think carefully and immediately went to Fuhe Lane near the Great World to get the wound medicine. On the way, she suddenly remembered that the young man had said that her father was seriously injured and in danger, and that the medicine would probably be ineffective. It would be better to go to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Station to inquire about the situation. After Wang left home, Chen Xishan heard the noise and woke up. After going downstairs and talking to the young man, he was also greatly shocked. The young man also said that there was a telegram from Wang Xiqing at the North Railway Station, asking him to retrieve it. Chen observed the young man's actions and found them to be suspicious. He immediately went out to inquire about the facts at the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Station first. Seeing Chen go out, the young man said to Wang's mother, "Later, I will go to Jiaxing with your daughter to pick up Mr. Wang Xiqing and bring him home. But we are short of travel expenses. Please give me 30 yuan for expenses." Wang's mother was old and weak, and she did not think carefully at the time, so she paid the full amount. The young man, having obtained the money, was about to leave when Wang and Chen returned home after inquiring about the news at the station. Since there was no such thing, they knew something was wrong. They rushed home and asked Wang's mother about the payment, only to realize that they had been deceived. Seeing Chen and the others return, the young man knew that the matter had been exposed. His face turned pale instantly. He ran out the door and fled. Chen immediately chased after him, shouting "Catch him! Catch him!" Hearing this, the guard Yuan Huairen from the 26th post and the police officer Ma Huaiyi from the 24th post rushed over and intercepted the young man. They searched him on the spot and found the original 30 yuan. They took him to the First Precinct of the First District. During the preliminary interrogation by the director of the precinct, Wang Kunli and Chen Xishan complained about the previous events and requested a thorough investigation. When questioned, the young man stated that his name was Wang Yonghai, 21 years old, from Shandong. My father, Wang Guanzhi, is currently the station master at Jiaxing Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. My cousin, Liu Chao, is currently the captain of the Fifth Aviation Team of the National Revolutionary Army in Nanjing. I was studying at the Japanese Military Academy. When the Japanese invaded the Northeast, we returned to China by boat. I am currently staying at the YMCA near the Great World. My cousin Liu Chao has a friend, Chen, who is a high-ranking official at the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Station. Today, he called and said that Wang Xiqing was injured by a train at Jiaxing Station, so he told me to notify his family and ask them to go to Jiaxing to bring Wang back to Shanghai for treatment." The rest of his words were evasive. As the matter involved fraud, he was ordered to be detained for verification.</p>

He is married to Bank Han, who is 34 years old. The couple often argues. Yesterday, they quarreled again over a trivial matter. Ziling was very angry and, at around 9 PM, tied a thin rope to the trigger of a rifle in the factory. He triggered the rope with his foot. With a loud bang, the bullet entered from his forehead and pierced through the back of his head. When people noticed, they immediately reported it to the police station, which sent a patrol car to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He died despite the treatment. The hospital notified the police station, which took the body to the mortuary of the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy, which will be reported today.</p>

<p>Six Clashes and Eight Defeats, Unable to Endure Abuse</p>
<p>Zhao Linzhen Resentfully Hangs Herself</p>
<p>Zhao Miaosheng, residing at No. 8 Cai Family Residence, Jiangwan Road, Zhabei, has a daughter named Linzhen, aged nineteen. Her nature is rather strong, but her mind is narrow. Zhao has a foster son, Tan Baobao, who is about the same age as Linzhen. They were childhood sweethearts, growing up together without suspicion. Therefore, the parents of both sides arranged a marriage for the young couple, making them an engaged couple. Unexpectedly, the Tan family's fortunes declined, and over several years, the grandfather and parents, among others, died one after another, leaving Tan alone. As a result, they were unable to marry for a time, and the villagers pointed out that Linzhen was cursed with "six clashes and eight defeats." Linzhen, under the control of this semi-civilized theocratic society, felt resentment and wanted to die. Therefore, she secretly bought opium and swallowed it to commit suicide, but was saved by her family. However, the pain in Linzhen's heart remained, so the night before last, she finally hanged herself. By the time her family found out and rescued her, it was too late. The beat police reported to the Fifth District Police Station, ordering Wang Jinfu, the local security officer of District 91, to report to the District Court for verification. Linzhen's father, Zhao Miaosheng, also petitioned the court for exemption from verification, which was approved by Prosecutor Yang Lu, who ordered him to sign a pledge to handle the funeral himself.</p>

He was a member of parliament and authored books such as "The National Revolution," "The Five-Power Constitution," and "Sun Yat-sen's Revolutionary Principles." However, due to poor health, he mostly recuperated at sea. He had been bedridden with lung disease since this spring for seven months. Although friends raised funds to treat him, he showed no improvement. He passed away at 3:05 PM on the 27th of this month. The funeral is scheduled for 2:00 PM today (the 29th). Chen's funeral arrangements are very simple; the coffin and clothing were provided by friends who pooled their money. They are now still trying to find ways to help his family make ends meet.</p>

<p>Appealed to the Board of Directors' Meeting Minutes</p>
<p>Ruled to be Kept by Zhang Lanping</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Housheng Ziji Yarn Factory, the factory employees claimed that the accumulated bonuses over the years amounted to more than 900,000 taels, but had never been distributed in accordance with the regulations. Previously, Jiang Zhonghe, Zhou Qichang, Sun Kewei, Xu Dianhuang, and others were elected as representatives and retained lawyer Jiang Baoli to send a letter to manager Li Diguang, requesting that the bonuses be distributed in accordance with the regulations. Li refused, so they filed a petition with the First Special District Court to request custody of the factory's books so that the matter could be resolved according to law. The Special Court approved the request, and Judge He Jun led bailiffs and police officers to the factory's wholesale office in Yongqing Lane, Shandong Road, to verify the books and ledgers of previous years. He then ordered Wu Heqin, the chief accountant, to sign a pledge to keep them safe. However, it was discovered at the time that the minutes of the factory's board of directors had not been handed over by Wu. When questioned, he claimed that the minutes were kept by director Zhang Lanping. Judge He immediately ordered the original petitioners to file a petition to retrieve them. As a result, lawyer Jiang filed another petition, and Zhang Lanping was summoned yesterday afternoon. Zhang brought the minutes of the meeting with him and retained lawyer Chen Zhongyin to defend him. After Judge He examined the minutes, he found that they were quite important and immediately ordered Zhang Lanping to sign a pledge in court to be responsible for keeping them safe, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and others submitted a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday regarding the Hou Dachun case, stating, "The indictment of embezzlement is of great importance. We urgently request that you conduct a thorough and factual investigation and petition the Central Government for a swift investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law, so as to clarify right and wrong and uphold party discipline and national law." It is understood that Hou Dachun, an alternate executive committee member of your party headquarters and a standing committee member of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, was accused by Feng Xian and others, executive committee members of the Sixth District Party Headquarters, of concealing 500 yuan in aid funds raised from the Commercial Press on July 24 during his tenure in the former Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association, intending to embezzle them. After being reported, he secretly returned the funds to the Commercial Press on the 20th of this month and retrieved the original receipt. The factual details have been submitted by the original accusers to your party headquarters and the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for verification, and the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has resolved to compile investigation reports and documents and submit them to your party headquarters for joint handling. According to reports, Hou Dachun, as an alternate executive committee member of your party headquarters and a standing committee member of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, if he is indeed as accused by the accusers, then the issue of personal character and conscience is small, but the impact on the credibility of our party and the future of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement is great. Only by conducting a thorough and impartial investigation by your party headquarters and truthfully forwarding it to the higher-level party headquarters for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law can we uphold party discipline and national law. Or, if the investigation reveals that the accusations are not factual, the accusers should also be punished in accordance with the law, so as to be fair and appease public anger. Therefore, we jointly submit this document to your party headquarters for prompt review and forwarding, and we await orders with utmost anticipation.

<h3 id="e173">Newly Discovered Parasitic Disease <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>A Conversation with Chen Fangzhi, Director of the Central Hygiene Testing Institute</p>
<p>Regarding the report recently published by various Chinese and Western newspapers in Shanghai about Dr. Jourdain, Director of the Public Concession Health Department, stating that a new type of parasitic disease has recently been discovered in Shanghai, which is very dangerous to those infected, an Echen Society reporter specially visited the Central Hygiene Testing Institute in Zhabei yesterday and interviewed Dr. Chen Fangzhi, the director of the institute. According to Dr. Chen, the year and month when this disease started are no longer known. There is no record of it in old medical books. Observing its widespread transmission, it is definitely not newly imported from foreign countries, nor is it a sudden disaster from the sky. It is just that people in the past were unaware of it. People in Jiaxing call this disease "𤵛 lump swelling," and people in Lin'an call it "loss of strength and yellowing." Academically, it can be translated as "blood leech disease." Hundreds of thousands of boatmen and farmers in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei suffer from this disease. It is also quite prevalent near Shanghai and around Qingyang Port. According to my (the doctor refers to himself) investigation, the reason why this city is spared from this disease is mainly due to the rapid currents of the Huangpu River, which do not allow the intermediate host to settle. However, areas within thirty miles of the Huangpu River, such as Beixinjing, Zhenru, Zhengjiaqiao, and Puhuitang, and even farther away, such as Qingyang Port, are all plagued by it. Those who suffer from it are mostly farmers, boatmen, and slum dwellers, while those in the upper class who contract this disease through swimming or wading are rare. Dr. Chen also kindly presented the reporter with a special issue of the institute's "Research on Blood Leech Disease," which contains the results of the institute's research over the past three years. The reporter thanked him and then took his leave.</p>

<p>Photographic Equipment Can Be Refurbished</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a large number of photographers in the country, but photographic equipment often becomes old and worn after being used for a long time. In view of this, the China Photographic Supply Company at No. 56 Nanjing Road has not only created domestic photographic supplies, but also established a "Photographic Equipment Refurbishment and Repair Department." The repair department is further divided into a "Machine Group" and a "Carpentry Group." The price is not based on the quality of the photographic equipment, but on the complexity of the work. It is said that many people have been bringing their equipment for repair in recent days.</p>

<p>According to tenants who have lived in Shuntai Lane for a long time, there are several shops on Baoshan Road outside the lane, which were completed gradually in 1919 and 1920. The rent has not been increased for many years. In February last year, the landlord proposed to increase the rent since 1924 due to the prosperity of the Zhabei market and the increase in land prices. However, after the tenants' representatives negotiated, the deadline was extended and an agreement was signed, stating that the rent would not be increased until 1931. Therefore, the notice issued by the landlord to increase the rent in 1932 is based on the previous agreement. It is said that the current rent for shikumen (stone-gate) houses in the lane is 19 yuan per month, and the rent for shops is 17 or 18 yuan. After the rent increase next year, the rent for three-story shikumen houses will be 24 yuan and change, and the rent for shops will be 30 yuan. The tenants in the lane have always had good relations with each other, and this dispute should be resolved soon.</p>

In order to develop, the factory has expanded its scope and increased its capital by 100,000 yuan. Within ten days, it raised the full amount and added many important staff members, who have already taken office.

<p>(Please Instruct the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to Guide the Work of Resisting Japan in the Interior)</p>
<p>Since the incident of the Japanese invaders occupying the Eastern Provinces, all knowledgeable people have been loudly calling for "Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation" and "Economic Boycott." The media, in particular, have been working hard to promote this, hoping to awaken the people of the whole country and make them aware that national subjugation is imminent. Everyone should unite and save themselves and the country. I think that as long as people's hearts are not dead, this time there should be some effect. Shanghai is a place where business is concentrated, and the people are enlightened earlier. Since the organization of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, it has been working tirelessly and has already achieved considerable results. However, when you look at various cities in the interior, you see that the market is full of Japanese goods. Although there are also Anti-Japanese Associations, they are not doing the same thing. I am a young man oppressed by life. This time, I came to Nanchang to seek food and clothing. Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province. All kinds of shops on the road hang Japanese goods in front of their doors to attract customers. Alas, it is still like this in the provincial capital. The situation in other counties can be imagined. After seeing the above situation, I was extremely distressed and thought of two methods. Please ask your newspaper to forward them to the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. If they can be done, I think they will be much better than the current methods. They are described as follows: (1) The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association should immediately select capable personnel to go to various provinces to contact the Anti-Japanese Associations in various provinces to carry out research on the most effective methods for each province (because the situation in each province is different). On the one hand, it will guide the Anti-Japanese Associations in various provinces to work hard. (2) The Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association should print more shocking picture newspapers and post them in various provinces and cities. In addition, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association should initiate a request for the Anti-Japanese Associations in various provinces to notify them of the progress of their work every three days for reference and to review whether they are working hard. Although the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association is organized by all sectors of Shanghai, I think that saving the country should not be limited by regional boundaries.</p>

<p>Special Coverage of Education News</p>
<h3 id="e187">Talking about Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation from the Standpoint of Education by Zhang Angqian <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shenyang Incident, like a bolt from the blue, occurred, all patriotic people in our country have felt deep anger and resentment, hating to destroy the Japanese to avenge this great shame. However, there are many ways to save the country, and it cannot be achieved overnight. The efforts of ten years of recovery and ten years of education must rely on education.</p>
<p>Is it not clear that Japan's success today is entirely due to its vigorous emphasis on colonial education after the Meiji Restoration? Therefore, if we talk about saving the country today without making practical and effective preparations in terms of education, it is not a fundamental plan and will ultimately be of no help to the great cause of saving the country.</p>
<p>Now the alarm has sounded. The League of Nations has become a mere formality. At this critical juncture of survival, we can only focus on saving the country through education with this burning enthusiasm, in a calm and resolute manner. This long-term and sustained effort will not be difficult to fulfill. Otherwise, it will be dangerous. Now, please allow me to offer a few words to my colleagues in the education field who are engaged in basic work:</p>
<p>Regarding school administration, follow the outline of resisting Japan and saving the nation promulgated by the central government and educational administrative organs, refer to the school environment, determine the central activity plan for resisting Japan and saving the nation, formulate a calendar of events for resisting Japan and saving the nation, create charts, booklets, and reports of various processes for resisting Japan and saving the nation, and implement them effectively.</p>
<p>Regarding the school curriculum, formulate an outline of courses for resisting Japan and saving the nation in each subject, plan the allocation of courses for resisting Japan and saving the nation (for example, secondary schools and above can add or change to Japanese in the foreign language department to prepare for studying Japan), collect materials for resisting Japan and saving the nation in each subject, compile systematic teaching materials, and pay special attention to various sciences to enrich the content and improve the level to achieve real results.</p>
<p>Regarding teaching, determine the teaching syllabus for resisting Japan and saving the nation at all levels and in all subjects, select and read records and reports of Japan's invasion of China over the years and the recent forceful occupation of the three northeastern provinces, as well as the words, deeds, or biographies of our country's loyal and courageous patriots, practice studying Japanese anti-three northeastern provinces' texts and propaganda opinions and plans for resisting Japan and saving the nation, or hold regular contests for essays and speeches on resisting Japan and saving the nation, and formulate examination methods to assess students' achievements in resisting Japan and saving the nation.</p>
<p>Regarding training, follow the education outline of student volunteer army promulgated by the central government, organize volunteer armies, guide students to study Japan (with special emphasis on Japanese education, politics, economy, industry, military affairs, etc.) and participate in various anti-Japanese and national salvation activities, and engage in the investigation and statistics of Japanese goods (types, product names, manufacturing, sales, etc.) and domestic substitutes for Japanese goods. Elementary schools can also formulate slogans for resisting Japan and saving the nation (imitating training slogans) to be read aloud for a few minutes before class every day, and formulate songs for resisting Japan and saving the nation to be sung in unison at gatherings.</p>
<p>Regarding equipment, design and arrange various suitable environments for resisting Japan and saving the nation, and equip adequate important books, teaching aids, charts, and all propaganda pictures and slogans for resisting Japan and saving the nation to stimulate students' thoughts of resisting Japan and saving the nation and promote attention to the Japanese issue.</p>
<p>"If you want to have blessed oranges, you must go to China; if you want to have wide oranges, you must go to China." This is Japanese elementary education. "Investigate Manchurian products and study Chinese issues." This is Japanese secondary education and above. Ah, fellow countrymen, do you also know to rise up and not regard saving the country through education as a foolish talk? Encourage each other.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education approved the document from the Hebei Provincial Government regarding the request to file the "Outline of Research Methods in Mathematics" compiled by Luo Gongquan, etc. The Ministry of Education found that it did not comply with the legal procedures and asked the provincial government to handle and reply to it in accordance with the regulations. The Ministry received a document from your government stating that it was based on a report from the Tianjin Municipal Government transferring the "Outline of Research Methods in Mathematics" compiled by Luo Gongquan to the Social Bureau for forwarding for filing, etc. The rest will be kept on file. In addition to preparing for inspection, two copies of the original attachments are enclosed for your reference and filing. The department's investigation found that all newly published books should be handled in accordance with the Publication Law promulgated by the National Government on December 16, 1930, and the regulations on submitting newly published books promulgated by the department on March 28, 1930. Those that are school textbooks must also comply with the review regulations for textbooks promulgated by the department on November 28, 1929. However, according to the author's original submission, the request is to review, register, and forward for filing, which seems to be based on the Copyright Law (see the National Government Gazette, No. 58) to apply for registration. However, the second article of the Copyright Law stipulates that the registration of copyright works is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. As for textbooks that should be reviewed by the department in accordance with the law, they will not be registered before being reviewed and approved by the department. In addition, the department previously received a request from the National Peiping Library to send the submitted newly published books to the Central Library. Before the Central Library was established, they were directly handed over to the library for storage, which has been approved and notified to all departments. The various clauses submitted by the Social Bureau are not legal and the procedures cannot be approved for filing. Accordingly, two copies of the original book are enclosed to reply for inspection and to instruct compliance with the above regulations separately.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Confirmation of Professor Laski's Visit to China <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Professor Laski's visit to China, there were previous rumors that it had been called off. According to Mr. Kang Liwu, who is responsible for the contact, these rumors are completely untrue. Laski originally intended to depart at the end of October, but because he had just returned to the University of London from lecturing at Miami University at the end of September, the University of London firmly requested that he stay at the school to serve temporarily because Laski had been away from England for a year. Therefore, he recently sent a letter stating that the visit would be postponed until early January next year. As for the claim that the League of Nations changed its appointment of another professor to replace him because Laski was leftist, it is even more fabricated. Laski strongly criticized the impossibility of communism in other countries in his book "Communism." Moreover, the appointment of Laski was presided over by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, which has nothing to do with the League of Nations. Furthermore, Mr. David, the exchange professor sent by the League of Nations, met with Mr. Kang yesterday and expressed his desire for Laski to come soon, which proves the absolute inaccuracy of the above rumors. In addition, the outline of Laski's thought, edited by Mr. Kang, is written by political scholars Xiao Gongquan, Lu Xirong, Wu Songgao, Shi Zhaoyun, and others, and is intended to introduce Laski's thought in advance. It is now being rushed to print by the Commercial Press.</p>

<p>Using Selection Fees to Entice Students to Prevent Them from Returning Home</p>
<p>A Strong Protest Should Be Lodged with the Japanese Cultural Affairs Department</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai branch of the All China Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Students Studying in Japan has been actively engaged in its work. The association recently received a report from students in Tokyo stating that the Japanese are misusing the Boxer Indemnity selection fee (originally intended to provide scholarships to outstanding students) to entice students studying in Japan to prevent them from returning home and engaging in active anti-Japanese activities. The association believes that this matter concerns the loss of national prestige and the disruption of the overall situation. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Education Bureau, and the Nanjing General Association of the association, requesting them to forward it to Jiang Zuobin, the Chinese ambassador to Japan, and Liu Suichang, the supervisor of students studying abroad, to strictly prohibit this practice and to urge them to quickly lodge a strong protest with the Japanese Cultural Affairs Department, preventing them from misusing selection fee quotas to anesthetize Chinese students in Japan and prevent them from returning home to participate in the anti-Japanese movement. The association has also been designated by the Municipal Party Headquarters to move to the First District Party Headquarters in Meijia Lane in the South City and will hold a general meeting of all members on the first day of next month to elect officers and discuss important issues.</p>

<p>The Middle School Preparatory Committee for the National Crisis Reading Sports Meet held a conference in the school's auditorium on Fuxu Road on the 26th of this month. A summary is provided below:</p>
<p>Gao Naitong's speech: Mr. Gao is the director of research at the school. At the opening, he briefly stated that the school is holding a reading sports meet amidst the national crisis for two purposes: (1) to awaken the people to prepare strength and focus on fundamental solutions; (2) to contribute to reading methods. He also stated that the school is not trying to be unconventional by advocating the high tone of reading sports amidst the calls for boycotting classes to save the nation. The reason is that education in our country is not widespread and there are too few readers, so saving the nation must start with readers. Next, he introduced the honorary chairman of the association.</p>
<p>Pan Yangyao gave a speech titled "How to Read During the National Crisis," briefly stating that in the face of the national crisis, educators should first blame themselves. As Mr. Gao said, we should prepare strength and focus on fundamental solutions. Young students saving the nation through reading is the current urgent task, and we should read science books and address the current urgent questions. The only method for reading is "sincerity," hoping that everyone will strive for it. The audience applauded. Next, Yang Weiyu was invited to give a speech titled "Reading and Saving the Nation," quoting the remarks made by Mr. Hu Hanmin, briefly stating that the present is a world of science, not just a struggle of military force, but a competition of the entire country, and strongly criticized the Chinese people for not studying the Northeast issue and instructing the youth on the direction of reading and saving the nation. His words were poignant and moved the audience. Then,</p>
<p>Du Dingyou gave a speech in which Mr. Du reported on his reading experience, detailing the poverty of his family environment, the confused life in elementary school, the disorganized life in middle school, and the diligent life while studying abroad. He has been reading constantly for more than ten years, repeatedly citing evidence, and his words were full of warnings, keeping the audience from tiring. Then,</p>
<p>Ye Xin'an gave a speech. Mr. Ye's speech had two topics: (1) Reading Methods; (2) Dictionary Problems. He reported on his own reading experience, supplemented by scientific methods, and reported on the process of inventing the four-corner coding method and his determination to reform the dictionary. It was fluent and eloquent, lasting for an hour, and the audience applauded. Finally,</p>
<p>Gao Naitong gave a thank-you speech, saying that the reading movement is still in its infancy in our country, and hoping that the people of the country will strive together after this movement to achieve results. The meeting ended as the bell rang seven times.</p>

<p>Due to the problem at the Sino-French School, the three football teams of Zhongfa Middle School, Zhongxiao Middle School, and the Third Team, which were organized by the students of the school, had a proposal to withdraw from the battle group.

<p>The Voice of Resistance</p>
<p>— Zhiqiang</p>
<p>Amidst the passionate voices of resistance, it is unfortunate that a very disheartening incident has occurred in our telecommunications sector. The content of this incident is that the Shanghai International Radio Station has been secretly colluding with Japan. The main culprits are the station's reporting director, Wei Daming, and two others. The Ministry of Transportation has been informed of this and will dismiss Wei and the other two and investigate them. This is not a trivial matter. We must ensure that this kind of thing does not happen again in the future. I sincerely hope that everyone, in such a tense atmosphere, will use their clear minds to think for themselves, their families, society, and the nation. Do not be tempted or seduced by any force. Do not let them blacken your conscience for nothing. I do not know what Wei and the others were thinking. I do not know what severe punishment the authorities will give them. I can only encourage myself and my compatriots across the country not to follow in their footsteps.</p>

<p>Al's mother is truly invaluable, allowing him to keep those poisons at home, as many as two hundred bottles! The conductor on the train is also interesting, actually letting him set up a laboratory on the baggage car! These are all angels who care for science and children. If there were no such angels, then where could Al, who is not tolerated in formal schools, be tolerated in the family and society? Children should not give up on themselves. Are there no places to study hard other than schools? Look at Al, he is tired of the dead education of schools, so he goes home and does experiments at home, and does experiments on the train. If he doesn't have money, he sells newspapers and vegetables, and uses the money he earns to do experiments. He lives a scientific life and receives a scientific education. Isn't this true life education? He and his little partners do it themselves, learn it themselves, and teach it themselves. Isn't this evidence of the integration of teaching, learning, and doing? The New York Times said that the capital invested in Edison's (Al's grown-up form) inventions and the businesses driven by his inventions totals $150 million, equivalent to $700 million in Chinese currency. Everyone says that China is pitifully poor. The only way to alleviate poverty is to create a wealthy society, not just wealthy individuals. The United States used Edison to create many rich people, but we want to use the future Edison to create a rich country for 400 million people and a rich world for 2 billion people. How will this future Edison come about? When he is young, he is Al, and when he grows up, he naturally becomes Edison. As long as the teachers scold the bad eggs a little less, and society, the family, and the government give a little more freedom and use a little less uniformity, Al, the Edison, will emerge like bamboo shoots after rain and be unstoppable.</p>
<h3 id="e209">A Glimpse of the Recent Situation in Japan <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Yiweishi</p>
<p>A certain Western newspaper reporter recently came to Shanghai from Japan. According to him, since the invasion of the Eastern Provinces, the situation in that country has become very tense. There are indeed many Japanese citizens who are dissatisfied with the military's dictatorial and aggressive policies. However, the government is controlled and manipulated by the military, and it severely suppresses public opinion that opposes the military's policies. On the one hand, it prohibits newspapers from publishing opinions against the use of force. On the other hand, it fabricates rumors of Chinese bandits infringing on the lives and property of Japanese people in order to incite its people to unite against us. All news and information published in newspapers are inspected by the censorship bureau. News about military actions is not allowed to be published unless it is distributed by their official sources. Therefore, the Japanese people know nothing about the truth of the Japanese military's brutality and cruelty in China. Japanese domestic thought is very complex. There are quite a few believers in socialism and communism. This is especially true for Japanese people who have received higher education, such as university students. The authorities are very vigilant against these elements, fearing that they will explode and be detrimental to the invasion of China. On the one hand, they are closely monitored by police detectives. On the other hand, they promote sports in order to consume their energy and thoughts and divert the attention of domestic youth. Therefore, baseball competitions are held almost every day. Even in the rain, they do not stop. The authorities are always worried about the thoughts of university students, so they conduct a test of opinions on China. The questions were "Is Manchuria related to the lifeblood of Japan?" and "Is Japan's action in Manchuria justified this time?" The results showed that 90% of the respondents gave affirmative answers to both questions. Thus, the authorities began to feel a little relieved. The reason why the majority of the university students answered in this way is that the Japanese authorities fabricate facts and declare internally.</p>

<p>— Zhuzun</p>
<p>Brothers have been planning peace for a long time, but it has not been achieved. I am shocked to hear that the strong enemy has already approached the city. Who knows who is opening the door and inviting the enemy? I am ashamed to have abandoned my pen to join the army in this life. Is there any room in the Qin court for painful cries?

<p>This is the power of propaganda. Several weeks ago, there were still many in Japan who opposed using force against China. However, now the entire nation has adopted a unified stance, backing its military action against China. Japan's military actions are indeed enough to strengthen the unity of its people. However, China's economic boycott is also causing the Japanese people to feel pain. Many trading firms that dealt with China have already closed their doors. Tokyo is filled with a military and political atmosphere, while Yokohama deeply feels the pain of the Chinese boycott.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Record of a Flower Plunder Marked by Teeth <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>In the southwest of Wujin County, there is a small village called Putang, inhabited by only six or seven families. Among them, the head of the Li family lost his sight early in life and made a living by fortune-telling, commonly known as "Blind Li." His livelihood was not bad, with annual surpluses. Furthermore, being blind, his food and clothing expenses were frugal, so he accumulated some wealth and became well-off. The villagers all called Blind Li a rich man. Blind Li had no son, only one daughter, of marriageable age. He intended to find a son-in-law to live with them and support him in his old age, but he had not yet found a suitable one.</p>
<p>Recently, bandits have been rampant, and robbery has become a common practice. Many idle young men in the village have banded together to become thieves, thinking that Blind Li has a lot of money and that he would be easy to deal with. One night last month, a group of seven or eight thieves came and broke into his house. Blind Li, as if following the Liaoning people's non-resistance policy against the Japanese pirates, allowed them to rummage through boxes and cabinets, sweeping away everything. Fortunately, Blind Li had most of his remaining wealth loaned out, so the loss was not too great. The thieves, not satisfied with what they had taken, saw that Li's daughter was beautiful. So they tied her hands and feet and took turns raping her. The delicate flower and tender bud were brutally ravaged. The girl's resentment and anger can be imagined. By the sixth person, after satisfying his bestial desires, he lowered his head and leaned in, wanting to kiss her. Unexpectedly, the girl used all her strength to bite his shoulder fiercely, as if venting the resentment she felt from the six men on one person. The thief, in pain, got up. It was almost dawn. He let out a shout, and they scattered like birds and beasts.</p>
<p>After the thieves left, the girl was bedridden for several days before she got up. Because it was far from the city, she had not reported it to the authorities. The thieves thought, "What can Blind Li do?" and went unpunished. Several miles east of the village, there is a town called Xinan, which is a market town. One afternoon, the girl walked to the market to buy things. At the end of the street, she caught a glimpse of a man who looked exactly like the sixth thief who had plundered the flower that night. The thief, suddenly encountering the girl, hesitated and wanted to avoid her. The girl immediately smiled sweetly at him. The thief smiled back, secretly pleased that the girl still recognized him and had not forgotten him. He thought that the bite he received that night was not out of hatred but out of love, almost like the ancient "biting the arm to make an alliance." So he slowly followed the girl, gradually starting a conversation. He asked her to go to a certain hotel west of the town. The girl gladly agreed, telling him to go in first and saying that she had some small matters to attend to and might not return that night. The thief was overjoyed and entered a room in the hotel, waiting for the beauty, thinking it would be a real delight, far better than the hasty act of the previous time. Before long, the girl led several policemen to the hotel. The thief realized he had been tricked, but there was no escape, so he surrendered. The thief was from the town. After he was taken to the police station, his friends, Mr. A and Mr. B, came one after another, wanting to vouch for him, saying that this person was not a thief but just a lecher, perhaps. The girl resolutely stated the facts in public, and said that the bite mark on his shoulder would not disappear in a short time, the mark was still recognizable. Why not take off his clothes and check? The police chief ordered him to strip and looked at it, and the tooth marks were clearly visible, with scabs still on the wound. He confessed after one interrogation. He was transferred to the court for sentencing. People admired the girl's quick wit and laughed at the thief for not dying for money but for dying for lust. The magic power of beauty is even greater than gold, they said.</p>

<p>1923 (Republic of China Year 12) (1) Japan returned Qingdao to us with extremely harsh conditions. At the same time, it allowed us to redeem the Jiaoji Railway for 40 million yuan. (2) In the same year, the lease term for Lushun and Dalian expired. Japan refused to return them. (3) In February, a Japanese employee of a Japanese trading firm in Hankou falsely accused a Chinese worker, Tian Zhongxiang, of stealing a watch and beat him to death. (4) On June 1, the Japanese army massacred patriotic Chinese students and the masses in Changsha, Hunan. (5) In September, a major earthquake occurred in Tokyo, Yokohama, and other places in Japan. Order was disrupted. The Japanese army took the opportunity to massacre hundreds of overseas Chinese, students, and workers.</p>
<p>1924 (Republic of China Year 13) (1) Japan decided to return the Boxer Indemnity, but used it for cultural undertakings in China. It set up a special bureau under Japanese control to carry out cultural aggression. (2) In January, dozens of Japanese Taiwanese people in Xiamen, Fujian, looted and caused disturbances. The Japanese government protected the Taiwanese bandits and sent warships to Xiamen, threatening our country not to suppress the bandits. (3) In February, a Japanese merchant in Hankou, Ubatada Zo, strangled a Chinese man, Mai Bangmin.</p>
<p>1925 (Republic of China Year 14) (1) On May 15, a Japanese cotton mill murdered Gu Zhenghong, a Chinese worker. This led to the May 30th massacre on Nanjing Road in Shanghai.

It shelled the Dagu Forts and used machine guns to mow down our defending soldiers. Later, it even lobbied the diplomatic corps in Beijing to jointly pressure our country. Beijing students petitioned the Duan government, leading to the March 18th massacre.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Special Features of "Second Visit to the Palace" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Shaoqing</p>
<p>"Second Visit to the Palace" is the most beautiful to listen to in opera. It has the following four characteristics: 1. Triangular singing, either a line or a section, with alternating and intricate arrangements, creating changes in the singing style. 2. Consecutive singing of "erhuang kuai yuanban," with no interlude left after the top beat, like rapid questions and answers, extremely tight. 3. Adding filler words to form long sentences, causing changes in the rhythm. 4. The play has only one scene with three different voices. Three different roles stand side by side, without distinction between guest and host, like a three-color bookplate or a three-color porcelain, with extremely rich colors. Therefore, this play cannot be performed without three good actors with good voices and seniority singing together. Because it is not easy to find suitable partners, it is not often performed on stage. Yesterday, at a friend's house, I happened to hear a new Gaoting record of Shang Xiaoyun and Wang Shaolou singing "Second Visit to the Palace." It was truly a perfect match. This record starts from the big painted face singing "Holding the young emperor, I grasp the country," and continues with "yuanban" and "yaoban" until the end of the play at "Protecting the country is still up to you, the Yang family, father and son." It contains four sections in total. Shang Xiaoyun's voice is excellent, singing the typical role of a chaste and virtuous woman. There are many striking phrases, such as "You say he has no intention of usurpation," using the "jie jie gao" high pitch, resounding through the clouds, smooth and natural. "The empress dowager kneels to death in Zhaoyang," with a pause on the word "death," and the three words "in Zhaoyang" inflected appropriately, comparable to Chen Delin. The sentence "May your sons and grandsons have high rank and wealth" is completely flipped to a high pitch, effortless. Wang Shaolou sings in the style of Tan, with an excellent voice, singing in harmony with the music. For example, "Frightening the minister to lower his head and dare not look up" is sung with an emphasis on the tune, like a towering peak. The sentence "Accompanying the emperor before the mountain, they also captured Li Gang" requires a delicate vocal technique in a very fast tempo. The rest is all smooth and lively. Qiu Guixian is the only copper hammer big painted face, like a grand bell, majestic and generous, with absolutely no vulgarity. Singing the word "mai" in "The old minister is old" fills the cavity and fills with sound, like an old tree blooming. The two sentences "Li Wen died with an arrow at the north gate" and "When you think about it in the end" have a particularly rich flavor. The fast "yuanban" of more than twenty sentences sung by the three flows like clouds and flowing water, completed in one breath. Only with the equal strength of the three can this be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e217">The Pestle of Knocking on Dreams (27) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>"Layman, no need to say more; this gentle pestle cannot be considered a tool to awaken the national soul! Pay attention! There are ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand times more pestles for knocking on dreams than this old monk has, to shatter your infatuated dreams! Your reliant dreams! Your dreams of being intoxicated with material civilization and lavishly consuming imported goods! Your dreams of blindly believing in military unification and only focusing inward! And other, other dreams that create future slaves and beasts! Layman, this pestle of knocking on dreams, weighing a thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds, will strike you head-on! You must be careful!"</p>
<p>Tao Chi exclaimed "Oh dear!" as if struck by a thunderbolt from the blue, receiving a major blow. When he opened his eyes, there was no elder, no revolving chair, no Unobstructed Hermitage, no horse tied to the large locust tree; everything was a dream.</p>
<p>Not only was his roaming in the modern paradise a dream, but also his journey into the past world was a dream. Both times he sat on the revolving chair were dreams. Tying the horse to the large locust tree and entering the Unobstructed Hermitage was a dream; riding the horse and running in all directions, unable to pass, was also a dream. The elder's pestle of knocking on dreams only woke him from a dream within a dream; though he was awake, he was still dreaming! Only this blow from the pestle of knocking on dreams truly awakened Tao Chi.</p>
<p>Who was the person knocking on dreams? It was Tao Chi's mother. What material was the pestle of knocking on dreams made of? It was a roll of that day's newspaper. It turned out that Tao Chi was feeling depressed because of the country's difficult situation. "When you're bored, you tend to doze off," and he had fallen asleep in the automatic chair! His mother, holding a roll of that day's newspaper, tapped him on the head, and he received a major blow, like a thunderbolt striking him head-on!</p>
<p>He opened the newspaper and saw the prominent headlines:</p>
<p>"Brutal Japan Occupies Shenyang! Mass Burning and Killing!"</p>
<p>"Brutal Japan Occupies Jilin! Extremely Tragic Massacre!"</p>
<p>"Northeast Airfield Seized by Brutal Japan! More Than Two Hundred Aircraft All Had National Emblems Painted Over!"</p>
<p>"The Large-Scale Shenyang Arsenal Looted by Brutal Japan!"</p>
<p>"The League of Nations Advises Brutal Japan, But Is Rejected!"</p>
<p>"Brutal Japan Falsely Claims Withdrawal, Treating the League of Nations Like a Child's Game!"</p>
<p>"League of Nations Adjourns!"</p>
<p>"Brutal Japan Issues Serious Warning to the National Government Regarding Our Patriotic Movement!"</p>

<h3 id="e218">Financial Gold Prices Slightly Decline <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The waves have not calmed. Yesterday, the standard gold price fell from high to low, forming a fluctuating situation. The waves did not stop, hovering around 710 taels. The buying and selling sides were still difficult to grasp. The spot price fell by more than two taels. However, the silver market fell slightly, initially rising and once exceeding 715 taels. Foreign exchange eased from tight to loose. Later, it was heard that India would change to the gold standard, which led to rumors of purchasing silver bars. This caused people to feel weak. The Guangdong banking group and various firms sold out, and the situation suddenly became sluggish and depressed, trending downward by ten taels. However, there was a slight rotation in demand. Later, the market became very peaceful, with fluctuations of only one or two taels. It is expected that the foreign exchange market will be closed on Wednesday, and various firms are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The trading of November and December should start on November 16 for swap trading. However, the actual delivery for November should be collected from November 1. However, because the US dollar was changed to the standard currency earlier, the swap trading was not done on October 16 but postponed for one month. Yesterday, the exchange issued a notice to colleagues saying that the exchange will temporarily collect the cash delivery from the selling side for the two-month trading from October 1 to 15. After October 16, it will still be handled according to the old rules, etc.</p>
<p>The prices alternated between rising and falling. The opening price for November and December in the morning was slightly higher by seven qian, at 711 taels. Large bars decreased by slightly more than one-sixteenth. The silver price increased slightly by three-eighths of a fen. There were rises and falls of more than two taels, because the Renlian banking group, Ren Decheng, Wupin Fuyu, Tong Taichang, and others were entering the market. Therefore, it jumped by one tael and four liang. At 9:20, it reached 15 taels and eight qian. Banks mutually traded 173,125 British gold bars. Suddenly, the selling pressure increased, and some firms had already learned of India's news of buying spot silver, so they sold accordingly, including Yifeng, Yifeng, Daxing, Yongzhifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, and foreign firms. The price was then at six or seven taels. When the British gold price was announced, it fell to 14 taels with zero. The listing remained the same, and the domestic market was also broad. At the beginning of the second watch, the US dollar was at 31.8125 yuan. Magali was at 875. Then it fell to 09 taels. Soon, the bank bought near-term at 31.825 yuan. Chang was hedging and entering the market, and Tong Taichang, Hengchang, and Yong were also entering the market, so it rebounded by more than three taels, reaching 12 taels and eight qian after 10 o'clock. Later, the foreign exchange market eased, and the forward price settled at 17375, and the price became less active. There were only advances and retreats of two or three taels, but in reality, there was a lot of selling in the market. It revolved around ten taels. At eleven o'clock, everyone in the market knew about the previous news of buying silver, so people felt uneasy, and Yifeng, Daxing, Yongzhifeng, Shuijing, and Dachang sold again. Then, Yifeng sold one-month British gold to Zhongliang at 174175, and the price accumulated a decrease of five or six taels. At 11:30, it suddenly became 05 taels and four qian. Then, Zhifeng, Shuijing, and others bought in, and HSBC absorbed US dollars at 31.9375 yuan, so it raised 13 taels. At 11:45, it was 08 taels and two qian. But people felt bad, and the closing price at noon was only 06 taels and six qian. It then rose to six taels. Because the Indian exchange rate was small, Eran again raised it to more than 07 taels. The announced price was 767 to 768 taels, a difference of 60 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market turned mild. The opening price in the afternoon was 07 taels and seven qian, which was the remaining momentum after the noon closing. The next was 08 taels and two qian. It then returned to 07 taels. However, the trading was extremely light because it was Wednesday. Later, retail investors bought in, adding slightly more than one tael, making it 08 taels and seven qian. Yuanmao and Yong and others got rid of their holdings and then suppressed it to 07 taels. Suddenly, it increased to 08 taels and one qian. After 2:30, there were rises and falls of one tael, but there was no spot trading. People seemed to be in a daze. The market closed at 4:30 at 07 taels and nine qian, which was a decrease of two taels and four qian compared to the previous day. According to the city, the maximum was 15 taels and eight qian, and the minimum was 05 taels and four qian, with a difference of 10 taels and four qian. Spot goods were at 11 taels and five qian in the morning, 06 taels and five qian at the noon closing, and 07 taels and eight qian at the afternoon closing, with the announced price at a difference of 60 taels. The water replenishment for the overnight account was 07 taels, and the water replenishment in the afternoon was 08 taels. Red bars increased by nine taels.</p>
<p>The inflow and outflow lacked direction. According to the statistics of trading on the floor, Dadeceng, Shunli, Wanxing, and Yu Tong Taichang all had more demand than supply. Cuichangyong, Daxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, Qian Changxiang, Yifeng, Hengxing Zhifeng Yong, Yuansheng, and foreign firms, and Wu, all sold. Yuanmao Yong, Yuan Tai, Hengyu, Futai Zhong, and others had uneven inflows and outflows. Hengchang Yong had frequent inflows and outflows. In total, there were two to three hundred bar inflow. In the afternoon, various firms had no significant inflows or outflows, only scattered amounts. The Dalian banking group had a total inflow of seven to eight hundred and an outflow of four to five hundred. The Guangdong banking group had a total outflow of two thousand.</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Foreign Exchange Market Initially Rose and Then Declined <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all showed slight declines, and the British-American exchange rate also decreased. The market initially rose and then declined. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged except for the Indian and German exchange rates, which each fell by one yuan. The internal market fluctuated slightly, and the standard gold price turned from sharp to weak, with a difference of more than ten taels. The Sichuan exchange rate seemed to fall, probably stimulated by India's change to the silver standard. By the noon closing, compared to the previous night, the British gold increased by 0.0625, and the US dollar was the same. The Chinese merchants' trading was not very active, with the British gold trading estimated at about 50,000 to 60,000 pounds, mostly selling. The US dollar traded at 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, with various firms and Xie Meng selling, while Meige Line absorbed some. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, there was no market as usual.</p>
<p>British Exchange Internal market had fluctuations of one and two, with the tightest at one shilling seven pence three one two five and the loosest at one shilling seven pence. The opening price in the morning was estimated to be around one shilling seven pence and ten and a half, buying at five six two five. Dehua and HSBC traded December three one two five, then Zhijin and Meige Line traded March two seven five, Zhengjin sold three seven five, Jiang bought two seven five, and HSBC and Zhongnan traded month four three seven five. The noon closing price was one seven and a half to four three seven five for selling and five six two five to half a penny for buying.</p>
<p>US Exchange The internal market had a fluctuation of eight seven five. The tightest was when the bank absorbed 30.8125 yuan, and the loosest was 32 yuan. Erjing bought December eight, two five, and Meige Line bought February eight seven five. Xingye bought January and HSBC bought cash, both at eight one two five. Zhejiang bought January nine three seven five and HSBC bought 31 yuan. At noon, it bought 31.9375 yuan again. The closing price was 31.875 yuan for selling and 32 yuan for buying. The listed price of one US dollar was still equal to three taels and two qian of silver.</p>

<p>According to a telegram from London, the price of bar silver for both near and far terms decreased by 0.0625, both at 17 pence and 875. India still had speculative buyers and sellers, and the market was stable. The market situation remained calm after the close. The United States had occasional inflows and outflows. According to a telegram from New York, the US silver price also decreased by 375, with the spot price at 29.625 cents. The British exchange rate against the US fell by four fen, at 3.8875 yuan.

<p>Market Overview After several sudden changes in the money market, it has recently been trending towards tightness every day. All related parties are trying to provide relief and maintain balance. However, their efforts are often in conflict, and they cannot easily solve the problem. Recently, various banks and powerful money shops have gathered large amounts of silver to support the market, totaling four to five million. Thus, the situation has been stabilized. It is expected that it will gradually ease from yesterday onwards. As for the foreign copper coins, the rise and fall of the current securities market will depend on the trend of supply and demand, so it is still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Coin and Auxiliary Coin Market Prices The morning price of "foreign copper coins" was seven qian, two fen, eight li, and two hao and one half, which was slightly better by one hao and two and one half than the previous day's noon price. The noon market suddenly weakened by one li, at seven qian, two fen, seven li, and three hao and one half. The morning price of "silver change" was four qian, and the noon price was three qian and five fen, with an additional surcharge of one qian and sixty-seven fen.

<h3 id="e222">The Internal Market for Long-Term Loans Has Opened <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The interest rate is 6.25 taels.</p>
<p>The internal market for long-term interest rates, which is a financial practice, was resolved yesterday at 6.25 taels, which is about one tael better than the tenth session (April) market price. The number of long-term transactions has been quite busy recently, but due to market conditions, it is not dared to be traded publicly, so the internal details are not easy to obtain. According to some news, there were three to four million transactions yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Stable Conditions in the Yarn, Cotton, and Silk Markets <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat, with no major changes. The situation is very stable. The sales of existing yarn in the market are also mediocre, with no large-scale transactions. This is because the situation is unstable and money is extremely tight, so it is difficult for business to develop, and the future situation lacks certainty.</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Exchange is Firm and Sharp. The opening price in the previous market was based on the rise in American cotton, and people's confidence was slightly firm. The prices for all months rose by seven, eight, and nine qian. In the afternoon, this month was the last day for delivery, and buyers were relatively short, falling by seven qian in the near term and one, two, and four qian in the far term. The total volume of trading for the day was 25,600 bales. Gaibai bought 650 bales of Jifeng, 600 bales of Gengfeng, and 850 bales of Dachang. Xincheng bought 1,500 bales, Taixing 1,200 bales, and Hengde 1,500 bales. Xincheng 2,000 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>The Yarn Sales are Still Good. The current yarn sales are still good. It is found that the total number of purchases from various groups was 1,000 bales, and 100 bales were entered by peers. The market price was flat. Among the customer groups, 350 bales were entered by inland areas, 375 bales were entered by Jiangxi, 50 bales were entered by Sichuan, 50 bales were entered by Changsha, and 155 bales were entered by miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3 id="e224">The Cotton Market Is Trending Upward <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market suddenly rose and fell, making it difficult for people to grasp, and the situation of American cotton was also mediocre. However, some bulls and Sichuan groups in this city had a strong intention to go long because of the poor harvest this year and the lack of sources from various regions. The thinking of longing had reached its peak, so the situation has been tighter recently. As for the overall situation, it is still stable and flat. Because various factories have settled on foreign cotton, they have no intention of buying domestic cotton. Currently, there are many who are bullish, and there may be a temporary settlement.</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Exchange Rose by More Than Half a Tael. The opening price of Hankou cotton in the previous market was based on the rise in American cotton, and there was a lack of buyers in the market. The prices for all months were five to four qian in the morning and flat in the afternoon. The total volume of trading for the day was 72,800 dan. Gaibai sold 2,500 dan of Jifeng, Yu 3,100 dan, Yongchang 2,100 dan, Shenchang 2,200 dan, and Senkang 1,500 dan. Tianlong bought 3,600 dan, Yiyu 2,000 dan, and Taixing 2,500 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to Southern buying, but later strengthened due to purchases by the Four Departments and short covering.

<h3 id="e226">Grain and Rice Market Active and Stable Downriver <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday's arrivals were not abundant, and sales in urban and rural stores were still active. Medium-grade rice felt sluggish, and prices were stable. Fresh, high-quality rice was briefly bid up. White rice arrivals were slightly more, but customers' appetites were not strong, and transactions on this street were limited. Bago rice was brisk and top-quality rice was selling well, while medium-grade rice was sluggish. The market trend was stable. Suzhou, Tongzhou, and Danyang pointed rice were well-received, leading to a strong market. Although the demand for broken rice was thin, it was insufficient for market sales, so everyone held firm.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, about seventy or eighty boats came from the Suzhou River. The market in this city was initially sluggish but later became active. The whole city slightly declined. Changshu new rice was in high demand, while secondary rice was stable. Shipu, Qingsi, and Yaozhong bago rice led to increased buying interest, which was not weak. Pointed rice from Yangbu was in short supply and active. The price of old white rice fell by a few coppers due to weak prices. Sales to various customers were showing movement, and the overall market was quite stable. Glutinous rice and rice wine shops and this street had slightly increased demand, and market profits were gradually tightening. About 5,000 piculs of river rice were opened.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Dalian Merchants Loading Foreign Rice <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Although the foreign rice market situation yesterday was characterized by abundant arrivals and inventories and a soft market sentiment, Dalian merchants, due to the empty grain reserves and soaring prices in various Northeast ports, influenced the Dalian border. The group, seeing the low prices of foreign rice in Shanghai, specially searched the market to buy some to load and ship there. Both small Jiaoxi and Saigon rice were inquired about, and this street also responded slightly. The market was thus active, and prices were difficult to rise further, although arrivals were abundant. About 1,500 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were quoted at 11 yuan and 40 cents, and 1,500 bags of small Jiaoxi rice were quoted at 10 yuan 04 cents to 10 yuan 07 and a half cents.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Flour Market's Upward Momentum Is Very Weak <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for all months was affected by the rebound in foreign wheat quotations of about 5, 6, or 7 jiao, causing internal and external sentiment to feel tense again. The opening price for each month was one fen higher than the previous day's closing price. However, due to many reasons in the current situation, most inland customers were restrained and stopped. Although the momentum was good, it finally flattened out. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, buying interest was not strong, and news spread that Russian wheat would arrive soon. Also, due to the monetary situation, the factories in the market were unable to fully purchase and accumulate current goods. Although this month is close to delivery, it is said that there are not many warehouse receipts from each factory this time. However, in fact, supply still exceeds demand, so it is not easy to be too high. As a result, this month was better by 2.5 li, November was better by 1.5 li, December was better by 1 fen, January and February were better by 2.5 li, and March was better by 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Wheat Futures Follows a Steady Path <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months generally turned to a stable trend. This month has already passed, and the long-term May should shift with the environment and foreign wheat. The quotation of foreign wheat has rebounded by 5, 6, or 7 jiao. It is speculated that the situation abroad will be difficult to fall temporarily, so the attitude of the bulls has become stable. Although there are rumors that are unfavorable to the wheat market every day, if all the current goods on the market are taken by the factories, the standard situation will naturally change. The restoration of people's hearts is not without reason. As a result, November was better by 3 fen compared to the previous day, December was better by 2 fen, January was better by 3 fen, February was better by 2 fen, and March was better by 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Sugar Market Opens 500 Tons of Raw Sugar and White Granulated Sugar <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>The spot sugar market is quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market reported that the price of Cuban raw sugar was still 1.4375, and the price of New York cane sugar for December was 1.23, a decrease of 1 fen compared to the previous telegram. The prices for March and May of next year were 1.21 and 1.27, respectively, both decreasing by 3 fen, and September was 1.36, a decrease of 4 fen. The price of Java spot sugar still lacked fluctuations. The guild's market trading was sluggish. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw granulated white was 10 taels and 9 qian and 7.5 fen, No. 20 medium granulated white was 10 taels and 7 qian, and No. 16 was 10 taels and 5 qian and 7.5 fen. Although there were some transactions, the trend was very weak. Taikoo sugar B mark was 12 taels and 1 qian and a half, D mark was 12 taels and 5 fen, HX mark was 11 taels and 9 qian and a half, and HM mark was 11 taels and 5 qian. The market situation was still firm. Huaxin opened the market to sell thousands of bags of spot raw granulated white sugar at 11 taels per yuan, but there were very few buyers. The brokerage firm opened 500 tons of raw granulated white sugar shipped in November from Dutch sugar, priced at 5 yuan and 7 jiao in Dutch currency. It was stated that the goods were new, so the banks' intention to import was still strong, and all transactions had been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Dried Longan from Quanzhou Stops Loading <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>After the second batch of large-sized dried longan from Quanzhou arrived, the banks' counter-offers were too low, and both sides were at odds and had not opened for two weeks, with no signs of approaching an agreement. The main reason is that sales are not increasing and prices are difficult to rise, so the banks have no urgent need to import, resulting in this deadlock. However, the existing stock in the place of origin is indeed not much, and the cost is not low, so they are all insistent. According to yesterday's telegram, all subsequent goods have been stopped from loading to avoid congestion, thereby promoting a turnaround in the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Silk and Tea from Shanghai Factories Are Difficult to Sell at Negotiated Prices <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no activity in the Shanghai foreign firms' silk market. It was found that silk sales in the European and American markets were not good. Although American firms had some demand, they were quite suppressed. Factories found it difficult to sell at a loss. Yesterday, only Taitai Shanghai white silk was sold for about ten packages, and Xinfu and other white dry silk were sold for about fifteen packages. Prices remained flat.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Zhenmei Tea from Luzhuang Has Poor Sales in Europe <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai foreign firms saw continuing poor sales of Zhenmei green tea from Luzhuang, Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other places in Europe. Although Yihua and Tianyu and other firms all sent telegrams, responses were few. Furthermore, due to the recent low-priced competition in the Moroccan market, the market was becoming increasingly sluggish. Only Jinjiang, Dodef, Fulin, Qianyi, and other firms bought a total of 245 packages of various types such as Zhenmei Gongxi, and the selling prices were extremely low.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Navy Blue Melton Cloth is Scarce and Prices Rise <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Original colors also sell more actively than before</p>
<p>Navy blue Melton cloth has been in great demand recently, and sales in the market are quite brisk. However, its inventory is not much, and most of it has been sold out one after another. Even if there is stock, they are all hoarding goods to make a profit, so the selling price has been raised by more than a few coins per yard. The sentiment in the mainland market is extremely firm and popular. Yesterday, the price ranged from 1 tael and 8 qian to 2 taels and 4 qian. Bald navy blue was extremely popular. Original colors were also more active than ten days ago, but there was no ability to hoard and raise prices.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Black Iron Sheets in Hardware Sell Well <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The transaction of black iron sheets yesterday showed the momentum of spring grass after rain. For example, Tianjin merchants purchased them one after another, and Qingdao and Yantai merchants also successively bought them. Therefore, the prosperity of the transaction was the crown of all hardware. Prices rose sharply due to insufficient supply. It is estimated that each dan costs 11 taels and 2 qian and a half, which is better than before by 4 qian. It is found that the number of pieces opened is more than 4,000 pieces.</p>
<h3 id="e236">More Than a Thousand Boxes of Tinplate Opened <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Recent transactions in tinplate have shown considerable progress. There are also 1,200 to 1,300 pieces opened in the market. Therefore, people's hearts are good, and the market price also has a general upward trend. Currently, the market price of 90-pound English goods is 13 taels, American goods is 14 taels and 5 qian, 100-pound English goods is 16 taels, and American goods is 17 taels.</p>

<p>Marc white coal dust has been in short supply this week, and the reserves in each warehouse are limited. There are only more than 2,700 tons of spot goods in total. However, recent sales have been quite brisk, so the selling price has gradually risen. Yesterday, the market selling price rose from 8 taels and 7 qian and a half to 9 taels and 2 qian and a half per ton.</p>
