<h3 id="c27">留日學生返國 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>最近我國留日學生。憤於日軍暴力侵犯我東北。都停止學業紛紛回國以表示敵愾同仇之意。此種愛護祖國之熱忱。至足欽敬</p>
<p>不過抗日不止於離日。救國尤不止於回國。在離日回國之先個人應决定回國以後所應負擔之工作。目的一日不達。工作决不中止停學業䟦涉道途犧牲不可謂不大。此種鉅大之犧牲。惟有從實際之救國工休中方能取得其代價。</p>
<p>吾人以爲留日學生諸君返國以後。第一應作之工作。即爲宣傳。國人於暴日之國情。尙多隔膜。彼國之政治如何。軍備如何。經濟如何。實力如何。軍閥之專横如何。一般民情如何。凡彼虚實。留日學生諸君親履彼國。耳聞見。應較清切。亟應就所聞見。或以演講。或以文字。告諸國人。俾人人都曉然於暴日之不足畏。壯我民氣。共起抵抗。</p>
<p>其次東北之半壁河山。已爲日人鐵蹄所踏。破現在獨立之聲。甚囂塵上。日人欲以滅亡韓國之手段。重演於我東北。昭然若揭。其欲併呑我東北。以遂其雄覇東亞之野心。亦昭然若揭。吾人今日應認定。必以熱心與赤血。才能救我東北陷於異族蹂躙之三千萬同胞。才能還我東北陷於敵騎踐踏之四百餘萬里山河。至於背棄祖國。爲虎作。倀之敼吹東北獨立運動者。實爲買國漢奸。實爲我民族之公敵。我犧牲學業。茹悲忍痛。萬里歸來之留日學生諸君。應本其愛國初衷。犧牲决心。以鐵血政策。實際從事於揭破暴日陰謀。剷除賣國漢奸之工作。以洗我國恥。奪還我山河。</p>
<p>上述兩端。固不僅限於留日學生。凡我愛國青年。都應共同努力。獨是留日學生諸君之所以棄學歸來。原爲救國。吾人深恐其悲憤之忱。或以長途䟦涉。心神交瘁。返國而後。家庭歡聚。遂令壯氣中餒。故敢以逆耳之言。激勵其奮門之熱血。吾人敢正告返國之留日學生諸君。諸君寳貴之學業。與寳貴之時光。犧牲至爲鉅大。此鉅大之犧牲。應從抗日與救國之積極工作中。求得其代價愼勿令犧牲無從取償。愼勿令應支之代價落空。</p>

<p>「日本軍隊業已佔領遼寗、將南滿路沿綫一帶重要地點完全佔領、並將遼寗政府各行政官吏除現駐北平之東北首領張學良外、悉數拘留、日本並已佔據遼寗兵工廠及一切重要銀行、更將沿南滿線之一切軍事要塞完全攘入日本軍事管領之下、此事之發生、係藉口中國軍隊之毁壞鐵路線、按日本出兵、事前並未通告南京政府、亦未警告遼寗當局、故張學良已令自己軍隊不必抵抗、由此可見中國軍閥已顯然在日本武力之前表示屈服矣、日本帝國主義之出兵南滿線實非偶然之事、蓋業已準備數年於茲矣、日本帝國主義者欲在滿洲鞏固以前所得之地位、以擴張經濟上政治上之優越權益、日本且欲取得新鐵路之建築權、並使中國資本家方面停止建築鐵路商港、其目的在完全監督東三省財政金融之組織、日本帝國主義者已顯然表示將擴充其勢力於蒙古矣</p>
<p>遼寗方面形式上承認南京政府爲中央政府一事、引起日本帝國主義者堅决之抗議、蓋日本方面認此事爲遼寗政府將依南京爲護符、而掙脱日本之覊絆、遼寗政府實行建築軍港、（按即指葫蘆島）更加重日本帝國主義者陰謀之亟進、日本軍隊現已佔領東三省之都、（瀋陽）而日内瓦方面正在舉行國際聯盟大會、日本中國同爲國聯會員之一、中國代表且已加入聯盟會之理事會爲理事、但國際聯盟必欣然接受日本代表芳澤Ｙｏｓｈiｚａｗａ之通告、又爲吾人可想像而得之事實、故國聯爲帝國主義者之武器、於此又得一較確之證明焉、</p>
<p>日本爲加入凱洛公約各國之一、中國亦已簽字於該約、但該仍不能防止日本取軍事行動以反對該約之他參加國、（中國）華盛頓外交部宣言且謂滿洲事件係地方事件、、不得作爲違反凱洛公約之根據、嗚呼該約之發起人竟自行蔑視其作品矣、</p>
<p>全世界之勞働者可以明瞭國際聯盟之被視爲和平之工具、其價值如何、、凱洛公約之被認爲可以保障發生新戰爭者、其價值又如何</p>
<p>綜上所説、日本軍隊佔領南滿線各重要地點及東三省之首都（瀋陽）實爲日本帝國主義者陰謀之表現、在發生軍事行動之東三省、各帝國主義者如美日英法之利益、本已常有衝突、滿洲事件將使衝突益形緊張矣、</p>
<p>蘇聯勞働者對於現在南滿發生事件、應予以深切之注意也、」（九月二十三日自赤塔發）</p>

<p>比來暴日侵我東省。國人於憤慨之餘頗多追憶甲午中日之戰役。加以記述者。就余所知。尙有徐少泉其人者。當時亦以報國心重死於斯役。徐年纔弱冠婚方二月。慷慨赴死。有足多者。徒以官位微小。無人加以注意。遂致姓氏湮没。良足惜矣。茲就友人羅邕君所撰徐君家傳。撮錄其事實如后。際此國難方殷之時。如徐君者。或亦後死者之好模範歟。徐樑。一名希顏。字少泉。江蘇吳縣洞庭東山西茭由前門村人。	父心泉。生二子。少泉居長。幼即慷慨有大志。年十歲。聞外祖父談天津新剏北洋水師學堂招生事。欣然欲應其募。家人以其年幼。且其父又遠商津門。家中乏人助理。再三勸阻之。少泉卒不從。家人亦嘉其志。勉許之遂隨其外祖父北上。投考該校。時清光緒九年二月也。入校後殷勤向學。每試常列前茅。所得奬金。悉以寄母。俾助家用。十三世界小事記</p>
<p>猩猩的理性在不</p>
<p>久以前。曾有一</p>
<p>位英國科學家。要研究猩猩畢有竟没有人類的理性。他便到動物院中去。在一隻猩猩的鐵檻上掛了一隻香蕉。而是猩猩的兩手所達到的所在。同時他又和看守人商妥。將二三隻木箱放在檻中。那猩猩呆坐在那裏。默想了一會工夫。末後便將那木箱逐一疊了起來。他跳到最高的箱上。終於拿到了那隻香蕉。這可知猩猩的有思想。有理性。正與人類一様。那科學家還以爲未足。又作第二次的試騐。他心想那猩猩要是見没有人在旁瞧着。也許能想得快些。因此他把猩猩關閉在一室中。他自己走到門外。想從鑰匙眼中窺探它的動作。誰知他剛把一隻眼睛凑在那門上的鑰匙眼中。却見裏面亮晶晶的一隻眼睛。也正在對着他瞧。原來那猩猩正和他一様的想窺探他呢。科學家經了這兩度試騐以後。便知道猩猩確有人類的理性。倘能設法授以敎育。也許有相當的成效。年十月。在堂學習期滿。由北洋大臣李。賞給五品軍功。並咨部奬以把總。儘先補用。十七年五月。充平遠船船械三副。十八年閏六月。調充代理康濟船操練大副。十九年冬。應母招回南。娶妻翁氏。婚後二月。中日之釁起。少泉欲北上。家人親屬咸勸阻之。以爲中之與日戰。猶之以卵撞石。無不敗者。參與其間。徒傷共命耳。少泉毅然曰。余之得有今日。何一不受國家之賜。今國事方艱。若不捨命向前。雖留此身。將可顏以對人耶。遂北上。二十年六月。調署北洋海軍右翼左營守備。兼充來遠船魚雷大副事。八月十八日。在大東溝洋面。與日人接戰。爲砲所中。遂陣亡奉旨照游擊陣亡例給卹銀四百兩。從優加贈游擊銜。初少泉之投考北洋水師學堂也。校中定例。投考年齡。須在十六以上。時少泉年僅十一。恐遭拒絶。乃僞稱丁年。始得入校。及遇難。年僅二十有二。因報名時誑增四歲。遂從之稱二十六歲云</p>

<p>— 鄭君平</p>
<p>這次遼寗失陷。也許就是中日兩國數十年來各項仇辱賑的一個總結朿的機會吧。關裡的同胞。雖然知道日本人的種種暴戾。並且常常能夠表現出抵抗的精神。但是身受日本人的暴戾的蹂躪的。那就遠不及東北的民衆了。若是你到遼寗省或其他東北的境域内不要住上幾天。你就可感覺到日本人的可怕。尤其是東北淪亡的恐怖。能時徘徊在你的腦筋中。</p>
<p>我自從春大到了遼寗。有時經過日本地。看見他種種建設與武備。也不知流了幾許的眼涙。及至察看東北民衆的思想與習慣。早預料到遼寗必有被日本人佔領的一天。後來就同一個朋友辦新聞紙。其目的專爲喚醒東北民衆的迷夢。以及向關裏民衆宣傳日人的横暴。那知出刋了幾期就被當局禁止。</p>
<p>在九月十日左右。我們各機關的人。就聽説日本地的商人都一齊武裝起來了。致於軍練習巷戰呀。野操呀。更差不多是天天載在新聞紙上的。所以都認爲是謠言。日人雖蠻横。也不至過度胡閙。那知十八號夜間十時。日本軍隊竟不客氣地界攻進來了。第一個目標。佔領兵工廠。所有一萬七千多工人。星夜逃散。日本人到了兵工廠大笑不止説是赫赫東北兵工廠。原來是唱的一齣空城計呀。</p>
<p>當夜十一時。我們新聞記者到臧主席公館探詢消息。臧主席很從容地説。「没有事。没有事」十九日上午。全市的各機關各銀行。都先後被佔領了。其中財政廳兵工廠長官公署三機關的門前。皆懸有日本旗。各銀行的現金。一律封鎖。囑經理把一切存欵。分四類開單。（一）大人物的。（二）各機關的。（三）私人的。（四）商民的。</p>
<p>二十日。街上很少有中國人走　。嗚嗚的汽車。完全是别國人和日本人。許多的日本男女小學生。沿街歡呼。日本地是由中學校的學生站崗。維持秩序。</p>
<p>二十一日。家家閙米荒了。窮苦的人就冒險搶米。有的米商。乘這個機會。特别漲價。結果一般搶米的苦人。完全是由中國米商。向日軍報告。一個個搶斃在馬街上了。</p>
<p>是日日本商會出來。找瀋陽縣長李毅成。共同設立一「奉天自衛警察局」只准六百名。每個站崗的地方。兩個武裝日軍一個中國徒手警察。來往的人。都要檢查。胆小的嚇了一怕。日軍就開槍打死。三個中國人同行是不能的。走到日軍面前。若是向他看一看。他就疑你是間諜。或是行走快了。也都是打死。</p>
<p>二十二日。臧主席被日方禁到商埠地一經路鮑公館内。臧主席要求帶家眷一齊住。日方也允許了。</p>
<p>二十三日自衛警察局長李毅成稱病辭職。換了一位闞爾壐先生。</p>
<p>滿天的飛機。散佈傳單。説是你們東北最高軍權者。不過問你們老們老百姓。我是來維護你們的。你們可以安居樂業。</p>
<p>設立奉天市僱用華顧問四人。</p>
<p>二十四日。我們許多同事。一文錢也没有了。米也完了。空氣一刻緊似一刻。大家遂商量逃走的方法。中國北寗車不通。祇得乘南滿車。到營口。沿路盤問。差不多時時刻有生命的危險。據説這次事先。日方有三十條限我方二十四時内答覆。我方置之不理。又展限二十四小時。十八日夜十時已止。我方仍無答覆。所以日本便不客氣了。</p>
<p>我今天到了上海。看到關内同胞表示。使我們對於國家前途的希望。還有點萬一之想。但是從每次的外侮中。我們很有一種感想。就是中華民國彷彿是學生所有的吧了啊。（不受酬）台命。倘尊著實爲小兒女所作。而願無償取得贈品。則當仍如原擬。奉贈兒童牙刷一枝。或兒童牙粉一盒。請向家庭工業社取之。惟郵政爲國家所辦。未能免費作贈。仍須附下郵包寄費十分。但又不免與貨價相等耳。</p>

<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>説也希奇！没有坐上轉輪椅的陶遲，他的家庭是很新的；他的父親，是鐵路工程師：他的母親，是女律師；他的未婚妻，是銀行中的女交際員。一坐上轉輪椅，他的家庭也變換了！他的父親，是一位古色古香的老貢生；他的母親，是略識之無會看盲詞唱本而不管别字連篇的老太太；他的未婚妻，不知在那裏；但是，他在　腸盪氣中，却有一位如花如玉妙人兒，盤踞於他的方寸情圃裏面。</p>
<p>那妙人兒，雖然深閨待字，還没有如意郎君射中那擇壻的雀屏；但是，陶遲不敢妄冀非分，只爲地位相差的太遠了！他是坐守青氈陶貢生的兒子，那妙人兒，却是現任山東提督唐軍門的千金唐秀英小姐。似這般的雲泥判隔，除非唐秀英小姐學那千金小姐抛綵球抛中了陶遲秀才，才能締合這門不當戶不對的婚姻：要是不然，陶遲秀才更無和唐秀英小姐訂婚的可能性。</p>
<p>陶遲秀才不曾出外從師，受的都是庭訓：自從開蒙讀方字起，直到提了考籃去應試，都是他老子陶貢生親自敎授一手包辦的。他有一位同學世兄，姓裴名時，天分還在陶遲之上；但是，志趣絶對不同，陶遲是八股的信徒，裴時却是八股的叛徒。陶貢生講給他們聽的八股作法，陶遲聽了，津津有味：裴時聽了，只打了兩三個呵欠！趁着陶貢生他往，裴時便溜到隔壁木匠家中，看他們怎様運用刀錐。他看了兩徧，便能頴悟；回家向老子索錢，只説先生吩咐他買書。他騙到了書籍費，不去買書，却去買了刀錐，在書塾中背了陶貢生的眼，努力於木匠的工作；他鑿成寸許長的小人，裏面裝置著機關，放在書案上會得行走；逢著寫字時，可以差遣小木人，取著水盂超舀水，而注在硯臺上面；同學少年見了稱奇，却被陶貢生知曉了，奪去小木人，丢在地上，踐了幾脚；恨恨的埋怨這八股叛徒：</p>
<p>「孺子，不可敎也！你不用心在舉業上面，而努力於刀錐之末，甚矣其不長進也！先王之制，爲奇技淫巧者殺；小子乎，小有才而未聞君子之大道，亦足以殺其軀而已矣！」</p>

<p>— 王振華</p>
<p>霹靂一聲、把這驚人消息傳來後、差不多全國的同胞都是膽破心裂、同時也憤怒欲狂了、當然、要是稍有人心的人、稍具熱血的人、誰能不這様呢、然而、啊、我眞不願説起、説起了是會心痛的、我們的學校、依舊是無動於中、彷彿没有這會事一様、每天還是照舊的做禮拜、念聖經、唱讚美詩、眞的、學校的禮堂除我們做禮拜外、是從不曾開過關於紀念式的會、這次的事當然也没有借這禮堂向我們説起一句過、於是就苦了我們學生們、想要知道點詳細的情形、就不得不多買幾份報來讀、和到處向人打聽了、然而有時聽到這様的話、</p>
<p>「你們讀書的爲什麽反不知道、難道你們先生不講的嗎、」</p>
<p>啊、我們是如何的痛心、難堪啊、所以學校的當局們要是能把每天早上做禮拜的一刻鐘省下來、講點事實給我們聽、我不敢説有怎様大的效力、可是至少能使學生們的熱心奮發點起來、課室中的琴韻歌聲、也總可減少些、然而他們肯嗎、嘿、國家亡了、不要緊、禮拜不做、得罪了耶穌、那才不得了呢、這様的祈求禱告、要是能使中國不致於滅亡的、能使耶穌顯靈保佑的、那我們曾説過、就是死在十字架前也還是含笑的、</p>
<p>這是每天都能聽到的、</p>
<p>「喂、某校已開始在練習義勇軍了、聽説除身體不好的外、全都加入」</p>
<p>「可不是麽、我姊姊的學校也已加了看護一課、她們都很熱心的學習呢、」</p>
<p>「我們去要求校長、讓我們也做點宣傳、練習的工作行嗎、」</p>
<p>「哼、省點罷、不是没有人要求過、無奈校長的心目中只有一個耶穌、其餘都不管的、他説「國家的事自有政府來管、不要你們瞎忙的、」你去要求也不過這様的一個釘子、」</p>
<p>二十六日、我們也放了一天假莫明其妙的一天假、學校當局旣不曾對我們説起參加市民大會的事、又不曾呌我們到校會議、只是莫明其妙的放了一天假、我眞不知道他是放我們去看電影的、還是逛游戲塲的、偶然聽到兩個小同學這様的談着、</p>
<p>「明天放假你知道嗎、」</p>
<p>「知道的、但不知放什麽假、」</p>
<p>「我想是放中秋節吧、」</p>
<p>啊啊、這是什麽話、我眞替他們丨學校當局者丨羞死愧死了、當即走上去告訴他們他們方始明白同時也憤憤的咒駡着日本人唉誰人没有愛國心呢所苦的是不知道、我這様想着、</p>
<p>啊、這是多麽難堪、虹口一角的日本兵的得意高歌、興高彩烈、有時還把槍向你們揚着、回家時沿途學生們的慷慨激烈、聲涙俱下的演講、都是我們深刻的剌激、呵、都使我們痛傷了心、恨傷了心、　　他們這様宣傳、是實行學生的責任啊、而我們呢、一點表示都没有、傍人不將説没有愛國心的冷血動物嗎、不差、幾日來朋友們的譏諷也已受的夠了、他們都是國立學校的學生、他們説、</p>
<p>「你們學校學生、爲什麽没有愛國心、没有民族觀念、想是被耶穌的迷魂湯灌醉了、你看他們初小的學生、也在散着傳單、喊着打倒帝國主義、你們竟不覺得慚愧嗎、」</p>
<p>呵、呵、這是多麽的剌耳、多麽的椎心啊、</p>
<p>努力起來罷、我的同學們、我們不是冷血者、耶穌的迷魂湯不曾灌醉了我們、我們爲什麽不急起救國呢、奮鬬罷、努力罷、親愛的同學們、國亡就在目前、再不容我們坐視了、起起、加入義勇軍、做他們的先鋒、（却酬）</p>

<p>— 周旋</p>
<p>這傷的消息、傳來後、他已經失眠了好幾夜了、他直是不能睡、因爲他太興奮了、當他一閉上了眼睛、横在他面前的便是鮮紅的血和火、</p>
<p>學校裏顯然是在異常騷動之中、宿舍裏和操塲上三三兩兩、盡是在討論這一回事、白粉的牆壁上、貼滿了藍紅的驚人的消息、標語、而他呢、整個的心是沈淪在憤懣之中、他直是抑制不了自已快要爆裂了的情緒、然而他總是默然、白天低了頭在沈思、夜裏永是失眠、失眠、○　　○　　○</p>
<p>這星期的紀念周到的人特别多、他默然無語坐在很前很前的座次、他靜靜在聽校長的很沈痛的演説、校長是痛哭流涕在説、</p>
<p>「······你們不能再不好好兒讀書了、因爲我們科學不及人我們被人家欺侮、現在祇有盼望你們讀書救國、」</p>
<p>他不能不可憐這個老頭兒、他覺得他是太可憐了、當這樣一個國家在風雨飄搖中的時代、我們的敵人已經站在我們的面前了、我們祇有用我們的拳頭去和他奮門、</p>
<p>他不能再聽這痛哭流涕的演説了、至少他認爲這是没有良心的虚僞、於是他注意到這大禮堂的一角上、在許多憂鬰的面孔當中、他看見一付微笑的面孔、完全是這會塲上的一個最不相稱的色調正像一張白紙上的一滴墨水一様、那個正是校長的兒子正倚着一扇門站着向一位才伴奏着黨歌的那位踏琴的密司在笑、這時候校長、丨丨那可憐的老頭兒的痛哭流涕的演説還没有終了、</p>
<p>於是他可憐到這位哥兒和姐兒、這正沈迷在戀愛的迷夢中的一對、他幾乎要大聲地喊醒他們説、這不是談戀愛的時候了、我們的敵人巳經站在我們面前、他要用砲火來毁滅了你們的愛、你們的國家和你們的民族、這國家、這民族如果被毁滅了的話、這亡國的姐兒、不能是你的了、你丨丨和你一切的同類都是奴隷、但是他不能、悲哀已經曀住了他的喉頭、他祇能默然沈思着、沈思着、</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>學校是終於罷課了、於是抗日救國會產生了、每次大會他都沈默底坐在前排、每次大會他都聽見有許多同學、站起來激昻慷慨的發言、毫無同情地指摘痛駡和攻擊、他們所舉出來的代表、表示他們自已的能幹、他們批評他們辦事不力、毫無成績、這顯然又是意見分歧、趨於分裂的現象、</p>
<p>於是他想、這便是中國所以永遠有内戰的原因吧、當這様國勢危急的時候、難道我們對内不應該有一點兒同情和原諒嗎難道我們遠不能團結起來嗎、那我們祇有等待着滅亡、等待着死、</p>
<p>他每次看到張貼着的堂皇的攻擊代表們的宣言、他不能不流一次眼涙、這流利的文字、自然可以表示攻擊者的能幹、但是這個除去使自已的隊伍分散外還有什麽呢、難道你不能開誠布公地去貢獻你的意見、去警告辦事的人員、取合作的態度嗎、這時候、是我們應該向國内的敵人握手的時候了、我們的機智、我們的武力、我們的一切是都應該用作抵抗那個來毁滅我們的國家我們的民族的敵人、不然、我們祇有滅亡、</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>他依然是沈默着、他帶着一顆憂鬱的心在走着、他的臉上像滿堆着雪和霜、在他的裏面正燃着猛烈的火燄、正像一顆快暴發的炸彈、</p>
<p>他不能再守着在這種學校裏了、這理的一切將更使他憂鬱和憤懑、他不能再守着這上海、這繁華的市塲、熙攘的人物、擁擠的戲塲、亡國的歌聲、……他不能再守在這裏了、他没有力量來喚醒他們、也没有力量來制裁他們、他祇有去了　　他有一腔熱血、一顆浴着血的心、他要將這血洒在已失的土地上他要拿起槍桿剌進敵人的肚皮他不要用口號、言語來喚醒這許多許多醉生夢死的人、他要使他們嗅着他的血腥而覺悟、終於他是去了、這走之前的種種印象永遠留在他的腦海裏、他要用熱血來洗凈它、來抺去一切、是的、這是民族的羞恥、這羞恥除非用血來抺掃是永遠洗刷不了的、祇有這個民族的血方能洗刷得了這民族的羞恥、是的、他去了、帶着他的熱血、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Protesting the Anti-Japanese Movement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Warning to the National Government</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government, due to the increasing intensity of the anti-Japanese movement in central and southern China, held a cabinet meeting today. As a result, a telegram was sent to Minister Shigemitsu that evening (5th), issuing a serious warning of protest to the National Government. The main points of the content are as follows: The Japanese government has always strived to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, but the Chinese side often resorts to anti-Japanese movements. In various places, anti-Japanese education is openly conducted among children, and the anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, the Anti-Japanese Association, and other professional anti-Japanese groups are tacitly approved. Illegal private criminal acts are not prevented. Chinese officials have repeatedly guided the anti-Japanese movement. Recently, anti-Japanese plans with a retaliatory nature hostile to Japan have been further expanded. Anti-Japanese riots suddenly broke out in central and southern China, filled with an unstable atmosphere, while your government has taken a hands-off approach. As it stands today, it may even lead to the most serious unfortunate outcome between China and Japan. The Japanese government is extremely worried about this and dares to issue a major warning to urge your government to reflect. (5th, Electric News) (Tokyo) It is heard that the Japanese government is considering lodging a serious protest with the Nanjing National Government due to the intense anti-Japanese movement in China.

<p>Three Destroyers Depart from Japan</p>
<p>The First Fleet Raises Steam and Awaits Departure</p>
<p>The 24th Destroyer Squadron of the Sasebo Fleet, yesterday afternoon, was ordered to dispatch three destroyers—the Machi, Momo, and Hini—under the command of Squadron Commander Lieutenant Commander Tanaka, at 5:30 PM, heading towards Shanghai to protect residents. The Yanagi is also continuing preparations to depart. The First Fleet, including over fifty warships, is fully stocked with water, coal, and is raising steam awaiting departure. Furthermore, the 26th Destroyer Squadron and the special service ship Noshima are also awaiting orders to depart for Shanghai within twenty hours. Extreme attention has been drawn to the anti-Japanese movement in Shanghai. (5th, Electric Communications Society)</p>

<h3 id="e3">Special Commissioners to Receive Lost Territories <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>National Government Cables Shih Chao-chi to Notify the Japanese Side</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations Council resolved that the Japanese army that occupied the eastern provinces should completely withdraw to its original garrisons before the 14th, restoring the situation to before September. Our side is responsible for protecting the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents after the Japanese army withdraws. Our country has decided to comply. Chiang cabled Deputy Zhang, instructing him to appoint responsible officials to take over as soon as the Japanese army withdraws from Liaoning and Jilin before the 14th, and to protect the safety of Japanese residents. A reply telegram has been received, stating that Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuchang have been appointed as special commissioners to receive the territories. However, the Japanese side is deliberately looking for excuses in various parts of the Northeast to delay the withdrawal of troops. The National Government has telegraphed Shih Chao-chi, requesting the League of Nations Council to notify the Japanese side to order the commanders of the Japanese army in the Northeast to contact our special commissioners to discuss the handover arrangements, hoping to fully resolve the matter before the 14th. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Zuoxiang paid a visit to Deputy Zhang last night and attended a meeting of Northeast dignitaries regarding Japanese affairs at Prince Shun's residence. Zhang was not very familiar with the Liaoning-Jilin Incident due to mourning his father in Jinzhou and only made a brief report. Due to travel fatigue, he is now slightly ill and will not receive visiting guests. Huang Zhenwen's residence is inconvenient, so he has found another house in Beiping. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, news from Shenyang states that the Japanese army authorities in Manchuria have decided to sever all relations with Zhang Xueliang forever because he still holds an insincere attitude towards Japan. It is also heard that Zhang Xueliang's Japanese military advisors have been ordered to leave their posts, among whom Lieutenant General Shibayama, the most prestigious, will travel from Beiping to Shenyang at the end of this week. This afternoon, according to a large official speaking to a Reuters interviewer, the Manchurian Japanese military authorities do not recognize Zhang Xueliang, and the government is not bound by this. This matter was decided by the commander of the Kwantung Army, Honjo, and other military leaders, to encourage Chinese security groups to restore Manchuria's security and not fear revenge after Zhang Xueliang returns to Shenyang. Although the Japanese military authorities have severed relations with Zhang Xueliang, the Japanese government can still negotiate directly with Zhang. It was also stated that if the Nanjing government refuses to negotiate, this matter will probably have to be resolved on the spot with Zhang Xueliang or anyone else who can maintain Manchuria's security. However, this solution is only for temporary convenience, and the entire issue still awaits a final resolution with the Chinese central government. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>First Step in Negotiations</p>
<h3 id="e4">Demand that Japan Withdraw Troops <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations to Begin After Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>(Beiping) At a meeting of Northeast dignitaries at Prince Shun's residence last night, the first step was to order Japan to withdraw its troops, and then negotiate compensation for all losses. If they do not withdraw their troops by the deadline, we will never begin negotiations with them. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain diplomat said that the League of Nations did not clearly limit the Japanese army's withdrawal to the 14th, and the Japanese may not be so easy to talk to; otherwise, why would they be making such a fuss? Even if the Japanese army withdraws, there will be problems with the takeover. The Chinese people should realize that our country's diplomacy has no policy in peacetime, leading to isolation in international affairs when something happens. The Deputy Ministry has already discussed considerable steps for taking over the Northeast after the Japanese army withdraws. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreigners report that Kwantung Commander Honjo Shigeru is tyrannical and unreasonable. He also gave a speech to his subordinates, saying that if the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin are developed within ten years, they will surely make Japan the number one power in the world. At that time, any country in the world that interferes with the Japanese army's withdrawal from the three eastern provinces will be dealt with by force. He also believes that no country's army can withstand a single blow from the Japanese army and that it will not be difficult to dominate the globe. This kind of arrogant rhetoric reveals a glimpse of his intentions. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report that Japan does not seem sincere about withdrawing its troops before the 14th of this month. However, because Japanese representative Yoshizawa stated at the League of Nations Council that he was willing to guarantee with the name of the Japanese nation that the troops would be withdrawn as scheduled, the Japanese government does not dare to show disobedience to the League of Nations resolution. Therefore, the Japanese authorities secretly ordered Japanese and Korean vagrants everywhere to cause trouble in order to create new facts and have an excuse. Our government has ordered local administrative chiefs to comply with the orders issued by the National Government to maintain local order. (5th, Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Jinzhou telegram: (1) The Japanese army in Yingkou has again occupied Niuzhuang. The Japanese army in various parts of Liaoning and Jilin not only has no preparations to withdraw but also seems to be staying for a long time. A large batch of leather and cotton military uniforms and many winter supplies have been transported from Dalian. (2) As of the morning of the 5th, Japanese residents stationed in Liaoning and Jilin still have no preparations to withdraw. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, twenty-four plainclothes Japanese soldiers traveled by train to Xinmin Station, with unclear intentions. It is now reported that the agency received a follow-up telegram stating that after the Japanese soldiers got off the train, they went directly to the consulate. The plainclothes Japanese soldiers were South Manchuria Railway employees who thoroughly inspected the station's train house, water tower, freight yard, crossroads, and offices and recorded them in diaries. Their intentions are unknown. At around 6 o'clock, they returned on the original train, asking workers before leaving whether the deputy commander had arrived. Their intention seems to be a military arrangement. (5th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles received a telegram from Beiping on the 5th: (1) A telegram from Tianjin states that the Japanese army is closing in on Jinzhou from Goubangzi. Several aircraft circled the city all day on the 4th, dropping dozens of bombs, causing much damage. The situation in Jinzhou is becoming increasingly critical.

<p>Falsely Accusing Chinese Soldiers of Killing Koreans in Shenyang</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, Japanese news agencies have been spreading news that Chinese soldiers killed Koreans near Shenyang and that there were hundreds of victims. When the reporter of this agency inquired about this news from a certain central figure on the 4th, it was said that the central government had not yet received any report on this matter, nor had it received a report from Deputy Commander Zhang about this matter. Communication tools in Liaoning Province are currently under the control of the Japanese army. The truth about the area near the Japanese army's occupied area is very difficult to convey to the outside world. It is not known whether this news is intentionally fabricated as an excuse to delay the withdrawal of troops. Even if this is true, when the Japanese army forcibly occupies our Eastern Province land, and our country's political and military forces are absolutely unable to implement, we cannot be responsible for all important tasks related to peace and order. Countries around the world must be able to understand this. (5th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Returning Students from Japan <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Recently, our country's students studying in Japan, indignant at the Japanese military's violent invasion of our Northeast, have all suspended their studies and returned to China to express their shared hatred of the enemy. This patriotism is truly admirable.</p>
<p>However, resisting Japan is more than just leaving Japan, and saving the nation is more than just returning home. Before leaving Japan and returning home, individuals should decide what work they should undertake after returning home. If the goal is not achieved for even a day, the work must not be stopped. To suspend studies, travel a long way, and sacrifice, one cannot say it is not great. This kind of huge sacrifice can only be compensated for by engaging in practical national salvation work.</p>
<p>We believe that after the students studying in Japan return home, the first task they should undertake is propaganda. The people of our country still know little about the national conditions of violent Japan. What is its politics like? What is its military strength like? What is its economy like? What is its real strength like? How tyrannical are its warlords? What is the general public sentiment like? As for its strengths and weaknesses, the students studying in Japan have personally been to that country and heard and seen things. They should be more clear. They should promptly use what they have heard and seen, either through speeches or writing, to inform the people of the country so that everyone clearly understands that violent Japan is not to be feared, strengthen our people's morale, and rise up together to resist.</p>
<p>Secondly, half of the Northeast's territory has already been trampled on by Japanese iron hooves. Now the voice of independence is rampant. It is obvious that the Japanese want to repeat the means of destroying Korea in our Northeast. It is also obvious that they want to annex our Northeast to fulfill their ambition to dominate East Asia. Today, we should recognize that only with enthusiasm and red blood can we save the 30 million compatriots in our Northeast who are trapped by foreign invaders, and only then can we return the more than four million square miles of mountains and rivers in our Northeast that are trampled on by enemy cavalry. As for those who betray the motherland and act as accomplices, promoting the Northeast independence movement, they are traitors who sell out the country and are the public enemy of our nation. We students studying in Japan, who have sacrificed our studies, endured sorrow and pain, and returned from thousands of miles, should uphold our original patriotic intentions and sacrificial determination, and use iron-blooded policies to practically engage in the work of exposing the conspiracies of violent Japan and eliminating traitors who sell out the country, in order to wash away our national shame and recapture our mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>The above two points are not limited to students studying in Japan. All patriotic youths in our country should work together. Only because the students studying in Japan have abandoned their studies and returned home, originally for the purpose of saving the country, we are deeply afraid that their grief and anger may be exhausted due to the long journey and mental exhaustion. After returning home, family reunions may cause their heroic spirit to wane. Therefore, we dare to use harsh words to inspire their passionate blood. We dare to solemnly tell the students studying in Japan who have returned home: your precious studies and precious time have been sacrificed to a great extent. This huge sacrifice should be compensated for by actively engaging in the work of resisting Japan and saving the nation. Be careful not to let the sacrifice go uncompensated, and be careful not to let the compensation that should be paid fall through.</p>

<p>Conservatives Insist on Tariff Policy</p>
<p>Prime Minister Visits George to Reconcile Opinions</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th. British Prime Minister MacDonald returned to London from his country villa yesterday. This important week in the history of the political crisis has now begun. If the Liberal Party leader is unwilling to include tariffs in the election platform and leaves the government, 35 of the 59 Liberal Party members in the House of Commons will follow Sir Simon and call themselves National Liberals, competing in the election on behalf of the National Government. There will also be a National Labor Party organization in the Labor Party. Prime Minister MacDonald will compete in the election in Seehan under the name of the National Labor Party. Although the Seehan Labor Party does not recognize MacDonald as a member, the Moulton branch of the Seehan Labor Party has resolved to nominate MacDonald as a candidate. MacDonald very much wants the entire Liberal Party in the government to be intact, because the government's appeal to the people is based on the nation, not on the party, and he does not want to be too closely integrated</p>

<p>to the Conservative Party. What MacDonald wants most is to point out a broad concentrated group, but the Conservative Party's insistence on tariffs and imperial development policies will make this desire difficult to realize. Reuters, London, 5th. Prime Minister MacDonald went to the villa of Liberal Party leader George of Auxerre for breakfast this morning to seek George's opinion. This is probably a rare event in British political history.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th. The Labor Party met in Scarborough today. In his speech, Hurst, chairman of the National Executive Committee, strongly emphasized the danger of a dictatorship and the folly of the tariff system. He also said that the former Labor Party leaders have become the spearhead of attacks on the unemployed. The government's economic policies are all based on the principle of equal sacrifice. The main purpose of the economic policy has not been achieved, because it was originally intended to save the pound, but the pound has not increased. Hurst also predicted that the cost of living would soon rise further.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 4th. French Ambassador to England, Mr. Fuloulu, returned to Paris today to prepare for the Anglo-French conference because Foreign Minister Lord Littleton is scheduled to arrive in France on Tuesday. French newspapers unanimously welcomed the arrival of the British Foreign Minister in France. Chen Bao said that the Anglo-French conference was originally proposed by French Prime Minister Laval, and Laval will soon go to the United States. Various important European issues urgently need to be resolved, so the British Foreign Minister's visit here is the key to clarifying the European situation. The Paris Echo newspaper said that most of the agenda of the Anglo-French conference belongs to the economic aspect, and under this circumstance, France should do its best to help Britain to restore its economic situation. Moreover, Laval will leave France for the United States soon, so it is necessary to understand in advance what steps the new British cabinet will take to save the pound, because the success of the Washington talks depends on this Anglo-French conference.</p>
<h3 id="e57">German New Party Established <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Emerged from the Social Democratic Party</p>
<p>Join Hands with the Second International</p>
<p>Central Party Leader Sings Dictatorship</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 4th. The left-leaning members of the Social Democratic Party, the largest party in Germany, have been engaged in organizing a new socialist party since they left the party. The new party held its founding meeting today and was named the Socialist Workers' Party. Two hundred famous socialists from all over the country participated in the founding meeting, accounting for twenty-five of the thirty-two electoral districts in the country. Lu Shengfeierd and Xueduo Huizi, the left-leaning leaders who were previously expelled from the Social Democratic Party, were unanimously elected as the chairman and vice-chairman of the new party. At the same time, a declaration was issued stating that the purpose of the new party is to declare class war on the middle class and respond to all international organizations organized by the Second International and socialist workers, but it absolutely denies the communist tendencies and steps, and will start publishing the new party's newspaper next week. As for the future of the new party, there is no definite speculation in the current public opinion, but its position belongs to the middle ground. It has formed deep hatred with the Social Democratic Party on the right, and the Communist Party is its strong enemy on the left, so it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve its political goals in the end.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 4th. Fang Boben, a famous leader of the Catholic Central Party, recently published a speech saying that Germany should unite the non-socialist parties to form a mixed national government in order to cope with future worries. Fang's proposal is close to advocating a dictatorship, so it is quite shocking in Berlin political circles. This kind of proposal is obviously contrary to the current purpose of the Central Party. Now that the leader of the party has made such a high-profile statement, will the Central Party change its party platform in the future, or is Fang's speech only his personal opinion? It is quite difficult to understand. Fang's speech is based on both diplomatic and domestic political considerations. From a diplomatic point of view, Germany is now in a position of isolation and helplessness. This can be proved by the failure of the German-Austrian customs union. From a domestic political point of view, the result of the recent Hamburg election shows that the period when Germany took a neutral and moderate path has become history. Today, Germany has no moderate path to follow, and it can only take two extreme paths: one is the Soviet political system and its economic group policy in Russia, and the other is to make further combinations with the capitalist countries in the West. However, communism will not work in Germany in the end, so the only way out for Germany is to restore its original privateism to compete with Russia's collectivism.</p>

<p>To all newspaper offices and elders nationwide: Japan is taking advantage of our floods, violating humanitarian principles and disregarding international law by attacking Liaoning and Jilin with military force. Although we have appealed to the League of Nations, they blatantly disregard it and use airplanes and bombs to attack the Beining train, injuring and killing innocent passengers. This cruel behavior exceeds even that of war. The more we retreat, the more arrogant they become. Where will this oppression end? The term "non-resistance" sounds like a death knell for the nation. We have spent twenty years building up our army in the Northeast, manufacturing huge amounts of weaponry, and purchasing hundreds of aircraft, only to have them trampled upon. It is heartbreaking to speak of. Now we are seeking help from the League of Nations, and even if it is effective, the losses will already be immeasurable. Moreover, its effectiveness is still uncertain. As the saying goes, it is better to rely on oneself than to seek help from others. We can only negotiate peacefully if we are able to fight. We must understand that the League of Nations is reliable but not completely so. We must urgently repent and awaken, and seek survival in the face of death. All citizens should receive intensified military training. Beiping is willing to take the lead. On one hand, implement a conscription system, with autonomous regions taking responsibility for persuasion, so that the whole nation is militarized. All non-essential needs should be economized and used for training and manufacturing purposes. Work diligently and practically, and avoid empty clamor, in order to show resolute determination. As for the failure of negotiations and the encroachment of foreign powers, we should replace incompetent officials with virtuous and capable ones to determine policies, declare them clearly, and deal with the situation with loyalty, trustworthiness, and respect. If the great powers are convinced, we will receive more help, negative feelings will gradually dissipate, and it will be easier to turn the situation around. Furthermore, I cannot refrain from saying that to resist foreign aggression, we must first unite the whole nation. To quell internal strife, we must improve our politics. If the authorities can sincerely take responsibility for their mistakes, the accumulated grievances of all parties will subside. Forgive the past and plan for the future. Internal conflict can turn into shared animosity against the enemy. If we govern the country with party righteousness, and select talent regardless of party affiliation, the use of talent will be greatly expanded. If we take the lead in diligence and thrift, saving resources and loving the people, resentment will naturally disappear. If people do not lose their jobs, where will bandits come from? If officials can fulfill their duties, disasters can be avoided. Although these are commonplace sayings, they are universally applicable at home and abroad. Politics is the source of military force, and military force is only the shield of politics. If politics has no solutions, then military force is just empty talk. When internal strife is quelled and internal troubles are eliminated, we can unite and fully confront external forces. If we have no way of inviting insult, we will naturally have no cause to be insulted. Learning from the past and being cautious in the future is the responsibility of the people. Adversity strengthens the nation, and perhaps there is a chance for success. Hasty words, I respectfully ask for your consideration. The Public Offices of the Autonomous Regions of Beiping City bow in respect.</p>

<p>To Shenbao and all compatriots: The Japanese are plotting and spreading poison. The League of Nations is powerless to stop them. Only national unity can save China from danger and destruction. The conditions for unification are still under discussion, but China's situation is as precarious as a pile of eggs. All compatriots should unanimously advocate and urge the authorities to complete peaceful unification before National Day. China will be fortunate.

<p>To all newspaper offices: Torrential rain has continued, followed by incessant hurricanes. Water levels are rising and temperatures are dropping. Flooded houses have been swept away by the raging waves. Countless people have been lost or drowned, adding to the misery. Starvation deaths are increasing rapidly. We urgently request and appeal for the swift allocation of huge winter relief funds and winter clothing to revive lives. Furthermore, the breach in the Yun embankment will cause a day of disaster for the town for every day it is not closed. We also appeal for immediate design and construction to prevent further deaths during the harsh winter. Leading with tears, we cannot bear the cries of despair.

<p>To all newspaper offices: Regarding the telegram from the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander Dong You, stating that the Japanese are barbaric and have occupied our Jilin and Liaoning, the entire division is filled with righteous indignation upon hearing the news. In recent years, whenever we have faced foreign aggression, no matter how outrageous or humiliating, we have always claimed that our national strength is weak. No one in the country dares to speak of war, nor is anyone willing to speak of war, enduring humiliation and seeking temporary peace. The more we retreat, the more they advance. The more we yield, the more they seize. If the people of the country still cannot temper themselves and fight to the death against the Japanese pirates, and still speak of "ten years of recovery and ten years of education," even if we surpass the Wu state, we will not be given any room for maneuver in terms of time or space. I fear that with each concession, the nation's vitality will die, and the arrogance of the brutal Japanese will increase, gaining an inch and then a foot, and destruction will be imminent. To kneel before tigers and wolves and beg them not to devour us, even a three-foot child knows that there is no chance of survival. The island Japanese are tigers and wolves, and their desire to destroy China has never been forgotten, not even for a moment. Rather than endure and wait for death, why not fight a desperate battle? Victory will bring glory to the nation and honor to the Han people. Even if we are defeated, we can let all countries know that China can be destroyed, but its people cannot. Even if people die, their hearts will not die. Yao Han serves in the military and has been mistakenly appointed as a division commander. The duty entrusted to me is to defend the country. Ten thousand brave soldiers are willing to be in the vanguard. With one gun, we will give our lives. With one bullet, we will kill the enemy. I dare to ask your Excellency to order the railway bureau to quickly prepare trains and head north to kill the enemy and achieve results. We will wield the lance of Lu Yang, array our troops, and vow to repay the country like Wang Qi. We will not consider success or failure, gain or loss. We are waiting for orders, filled with apprehension and so on. This special telegram is sent for your information, and we respectfully await your instructions.

<h3 id="e69">Japanese Incitement <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Behind the Scenes of Manchuria and Mongolia Independence</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Although the Japanese representative made a responsible statement at the League of Nations Council that Japanese troops would be completely withdrawn by October 14, whether the Japanese government can actually uphold its international commitments remains a major question. The planned Japanese scheme involves, under a state of military occupation, buying off ignorant gentry in the Northeast, inciting independence, and organizing local governments protected by Japan, so that the Northeast will be substantially detached from the Republic of China forever and form a protectorate of Japan. Yuan Jin-kai, Tian Chong-han, and Li You-lan in Liaoning, and Xi Qia in Jilin, are all willingly instigated to either form security maintenance committees or establish separate local governments. Such a loss of conscience is tantamount to voluntarily renouncing the nationality of the Republic of China. The Shenyang Security Maintenance Committee, under the command of Japanese Major Doihara, is ostensibly maintaining security but actually performing the functions of a local government. This is because the Japanese side wants to use this transitional mechanism as a springboard for further schemes. Judging from the various news reports from all sides in recent days, Japan initially wanted to move Puyi to Liaoning to govern the four provinces and restore the Qing Empire. Later, because Puyi did not dare to attempt it rashly, there was a proposal to invite Zhang Zongchang and Shi Yousan. It is said that Zhang and Shi also know that in such a situation, not only would they not be able to sustain themselves in reality, but even if they succeeded, they would be no more than a second Korea, forever guilty of betraying the nation. They were quite apprehensive and dared not accept. At this point, the Japanese took local materials and bought off Yuan Jin-kai, Yu Chong-han, Xi Qia, and the like as pawns. At the same time, they spread the idea that the people of the Northeast wanted to seek independence, forcibly violating the will of the people and falsely claiming that it was the spontaneous action of the Chinese people in order to deceive the world. After the Japanese army occupied various places in Liaoning and Jilin, they first confiscated the seals and archives of various military and political organs and legal entities, obviously intending to forge official documents and letters to spread opinions favorable to Japanese schemes in order to promote their realization. After the Japanese army bombed the Beida Camp, they falsely claimed to have found under the bed of Wang Yizhe, commander of the Seventh Brigade, the original text of his secret order to sabotage the South Manchurian Railway. The text reads as follows: "At 2:00 a.m. on the 19th, take pre-announced secret emergency action. All personnel should fulfill their duties." This is what Japan considers to be the reason for this military action by the Japanese army, and it is also what they consider to be ironclad proof that our country started the incident. The secret order was forged by the Japanese. A single reading makes it clear. First, since it was a secret order, it should have been issued long ago. How could it have been left under the bed? Moreover, there is no reason to keep a copy of such an important secret order to the outside world. Second, the time when the Japanese side launched this incident was 10:00 p.m. on the 18th, while the time when our army allegedly dug up and destroyed the South Manchurian Railway, according to them, was 8:00 p.m. on the 18th. However, the time originally scheduled in the secret order that Japan claimed to have found was 2:00 a.m. on the 19th, which is a difference of six hours. If the sabotage of the railway was a pre-planned scheme by China, and the secret order had already been issued, why was it advanced by six hours temporarily? Such a self-contradictory forged document is truly not worth the laughter of those who know the truth. From this one point, one can see the rest. The Northeast independence incident that they are currently inciting, there is no doubt that the Japanese side will also use the seals they seized to forge public opinion. At present, the rumor that the Heihe (Heilongjiang) Harbin independent organization has established a government has been confirmed to be untrue. However, yesterday's Shenyang dispatch from the Japanese Telegraphic Communication Society still falsely claimed that Manchurian and Mongolian figures recently held a secret meeting in Shenyang and resolved to establish a Manchurian Republic buffer state. At the same time, another dispatch from the same agency claimed that many people in the Northeast advocated overthrowing the warlords and establishing a government based on the masses. It was reported that some local areas were planning to sever relations with the warlords and establish a new force. It was also said that a political division would occur in Jilin and Heilongjiang within a few days. From this, it can be seen that what Japan is urgently pursuing today is to form an independent situation in the Northeast under the protection of Japanese forces. If the Northeast cannot obtain a leader to govern the overall situation, then the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang will each be independent, but the overall direction will still be secretly controlled by Japan. Although the local government of Liaoning has not been established, Japan is still vigorously pursuing it. Jilin is using the dim-witted and ignorant Xi Qia as a puppet. Xi Qia is from Manchuria and is also a member of the imperial clan. His thoughts are unknown. Judging from his actions this time, he is at least a brainless person. It is said that Zhang Zuoxiang sent a telegram to Beiping yesterday, saying that Xi Qia was forced to do this under the pressure of the Japanese army and would not willingly become a traitor. The truth is unknown in today's chaotic state of affairs. If Japan's scheme to incite Northeast independence is realized, then even if Japan withdraws its troops, the Northeast will no longer be ours. It is said that the people of the Northeast who have fled to Beiping are extremely indignant at this warning. Those with aspirations plan to organize a Northeast Self-Determination Association, declaring that they will not cooperate with the Japanese and warning the people outside the customs not to be deceived by the Japanese, lest they bring about the tragedy of national destruction and family ruin. Zhang Xueliang also believes that this matter concerns the survival of the Northeast and cannot be ignored. He has telegraphed the Central Government to order Shi Zhaoji to represent China and make an urgent and serious protest to the League of Nations Council. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Jiang Zuobin, the ambassador to Japan, to question the Japanese government. The main points of the oral statement and reply are as follows:</p>
<p>China's statement: According to reports, there are organizations attempting to establish an independent government in our four eastern provinces. These actions to undermine the territory of the Republic of China cannot be prevented by our government before the withdrawal of your country's troops. Your government should bear full responsibility. I am writing to inform you of this and request your Excellency to reply. One. Japan's reply: This military action was taken for self-defense. Although some locations in Manchuria, outside the Japanese railway concession area, were temporarily occupied, recently, as the local political maintenance organs on the Chinese side have been completed, they have not only gradually gathered within the railway concession area, but also these locations have never been subject to military administration from the beginning. Moreover, in view of the current situation, the Japanese government has long prohibited its civil and military officials from encouraging or assisting the Chinese in their efforts to establish a regime in Manchuria, and is taking all appropriate legal measures to crack down on Japanese interference in such efforts. The Japanese government is not in a position to take any responsibility for the aforementioned Chinese actions, no matter what the meaning or argument. As for the establishment of local security maintenance organs, in the current situation where bandits are rampant in Manchuria, from the viewpoint of restoring security in various places and enabling Chinese and foreign residents to be safe, and the Japanese army can easily gather in the concession area, the Japanese government welcomes it.

<h3 id="e70">A Returnee from Jilin Talks <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Tragic History of Jilin and Changchun's Occupation</p>
<p>Yesterday, a gentleman who escaped from Jilin to Beijing recounted to a reporter from the Central News Agency the brutal details of the Japanese army's invasion and occupation of Jilin and Changchun, as well as the actual situation on the ground. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese occupied Changchun, and soldiers and civilians died tragically. At 3:00 a.m. on September 19, the Japanese army suddenly arrived at Erdaogou, the location of our army's garrison in Changchun. They shot and killed two guards at the gate, rushed into the courtyard, and claimed that they wanted to see Battalion Commander Fu. When Battalion Commander Fu came out to meet them, the Japanese army said that they were ordered by the Imperial government to come here to disarm. Battalion Commander Fu replied, "The firearms of soldiers of the Republic of China cannot leave their bodies without the order of their superiors." Before he could finish speaking, the Japanese army shot and killed him. They then went to the barracks and used machine guns to strafe unarmed soldiers. More than 150 soldiers were killed on the spot. The rest were awakened from their dreams and fled in all directions, but the Japanese soldiers still used machine guns to strafe them, and many died. The garrison there was a battalion, and the number of those who escaped was very small. After the Japanese soldiers resolved our country's garrison in Erdaogou, they occupied the Kuanchengzi Railway Station and replaced the Chinese and Russian flags with the Japanese flag. At the same time, there was an artillery regiment stationed at Nanling in Changchun. The Japanese army surrounded the barracks and first contacted the regimental commander to disarm. The regimental commander asked Xi Qia how to handle it, and Xi Qia ordered him not to resist. The regimental commander immediately relayed the order to the soldiers to obey. After the matter was completed, the soldiers asked the Japanese army to leave the barracks unarmed, and the Japanese army agreed. However, when our unarmed soldiers were walking out, they were shot dead by the Japanese soldiers with machine guns. At that time, more than 50 soldiers were extremely grieved and angry. They smashed the gate of the ammunition depot, snatched out guns and ammunition, and began to make a final resistance with the Japanese army. They fought bravely and desperately. Although 60 or 70 were killed, 40 Japanese soldiers also died. Eventually, they all withdrew into the mountains and concentrated in the Shuangcheng County area along the China Eastern Railway. After the Japanese soldiers resolved the Changchun garrison, they occupied all the police and completely occupied the Public Security Bureau and the county office. All transportation and financial agencies were also occupied, and Chinese banks were occupied. Dozens of citizens were shot and killed, causing all businesses to close their doors and people to panic to the extreme. After Changchun fell into the hands of the Japanese army, they concentrated their main force and forcibly occupied a train on the China Eastern Railway. They forced their way onto the train and forced the driver to drive. When the driver refused to listen, the Japanese soldiers shot and killed the Russian driver. The Japanese army wanted to take Jilin and first occupied the Jichang Railway, replacing all important personnel with Japanese personnel. They concentrated heavy troops at the Xi Jiutai Station on the Jichang Railway.</p>
<p>Xi Qia of Jilin Surrenders to the Japanese The acting chairman of Jilin Province, Xi Qia, was extremely stubborn. He usually relied on his familiarity with the Japanese side, so his defenses were very lax after the Shenyang incident. After the Japanese army occupied Xia Jiutai Station, Xi Qia realized that the situation was urgent. On the morning of the 20th, he sent a Japanese advisor from the provincial government, as well as a chief of staff and a staff officer, to inspect Tumuling. At that time, all the long-distance telephone lines were out of order, and there was no one at the Jilin and Jihai General Stations. Railway officials fled. The various government offices were in extreme disarray. Xi Qia urgently summoned the chiefs of various sections of the military department for a meeting. At this time, Japanese aircraft No. 51 had arrived in the airspace above Jilin, circling for several hours, quite close to the ground, about 200 meters or so, scattering leaflets, the gist of which was to persuade businessmen and people not to panic and to continue their businesses in peace. Anyone who obstructed the advance of the Japanese army would be killed without mercy, and so on. After the planes left, people were even more panicked and uncertain. The whole city was filled with terror. At 6:00 p.m., three Japanese troop trains arrived at Jilin Station one after another. After disembarking, they immediately designated the station as a war zone and erected twelve artillery pieces. As a result, Jilin was occupied by the Japanese army without resistance. At that time, Xi Qia's actions were no longer free. At 10:00 a.m. the next morning, the Japanese army invited Xi Qia to a meeting at the Nagoya Hotel. Lieutenant General Domon, commander of the 2nd Japanese Army Corps, questioned Xi Qia, saying, "We see that you are quite capable, how can you allow the army to take away their weapons? You can't even restrain your own army." After speaking, he left in a huff, ordering four Japanese soldiers to strictly monitor Xi Qia. Before long, Domon returned and ordered Xi Qia to turn in all the weapons of all the troops by 5:00 p.m., otherwise there would be consequences. Then, Japanese soldiers escorted Xi Qia to the provincial government, forcing Xi Qia to use the telephone to notify the garrisons in various places that they must turn in all of their</p>

<p>weapons, otherwise the Japanese soldiers would bomb them, and set the deadline for 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>The scene in Jilin City was desolate. After the Japanese soldiers disembarked, they advanced in an exploratory manner and erected machine guns and artillery at various main streets. The headquarters of the 2nd Division of the Japanese Army was set up in the Nagoya Hotel. The Japanese Residents Association was converted into a telegraph team. Twenty artillery pieces were erected in front of the consulate, and thirty were erected inside, cutting off traffic. All Chinese agencies were occupied by the Japanese army. In addition to cutting off all telephone lines, transportation agencies guarded the wired telegraph and radio stations, forbidding the sending of even a single word. The official silver house was also sealed off, and the cash was moved to the consulate, totaling about 500,000 yuan. All city gates were guarded by Japanese soldiers, and dozens of cavalrymen patrolled the streets. Japanese residents were triumphant, while Japanese soldiers were fierce-looking and rampaged through the streets. Military telephone lines were scattered all over the ground. Pedestrians who were not careful and stepped on the lines would be shot. They were so aggressive that they seemed like they would devour people. If they encountered someone wearing a student uniform or someone with slightly clean clothes, they would be shot or even stabbed to death. After several students were killed, they warned each other not to go out. If they went out, they had to wear short, tattered clothes to avoid harm. Therefore, there were few pedestrians on the streets, and the scene was desolate.</p>
<p>The Japanese army arbitrarily shot and killed students. After the Japanese army occupied Jilin, they first occupied Jilin University, erected an artillery piece on the roof of the new school building, and erected two machine guns in front of the gate, stationing more than 20 Japanese soldiers. Because the school had not yet started, there was no one in the school. Yulin Middle School had more than 500 students who took refuge in the water company. The Japanese army occupied the company and forcibly dispersed the students, and countless were stabbed with guns. Japanese soldiers also erected an artillery piece on the platform on the roof of the company's building and erected two machine guns in the courtyard. After occupying this place, they went to the police academy to disarm. When some students refused to obey, 13 of them were stabbed and their current condition is unknown. When the Japanese soldiers hit them with their guns, they were not allowed to explain. If they argued even slightly, they would be stabbed to death.</p>
<p>Model soldiers bravely fought the enemy. After the Japanese soldiers intimidated and monitored Xi Qia and sent him back to the provincial government, they forced Xi Qia to send representatives to persuade the soldiers to disarm, and personally ordered the commanders of each camp and regiment by telephone. At that time, 50 patriots in Jilin, although they wanted to sacrifice themselves for the country, had no way to do so with their bare hands. Later, they heard that Wang Jun could borrow 30 pistols (Mauser pistols) and that there were 3,000 rounds of ammunition. Everyone felt that they had to fight the Japanese. However, when they went to get the guns and ammunition, they found that there was nothing to be found, and they wanted to cry but had no tears. These 50 people decided to go to the army, divided into seven teams of two people each, and went to the garrisons in Kouqian Tun, Xiaobaishan, Dong Tuan Shan, Jiang Mifeng, Wula Street, and Jiaohe to persuade them not to disarm. The gun is life, and life is the gun, in order to preserve the face of the country. The soldiers were moved by their words and expressed their willingness to fight to the death with the Japanese soldiers. On the morning of that day, the Japanese soldiers had disarmed a company of student soldiers at the military academy, taking away 250 guns and 6 machine guns. By the time they reached Wula Street, Battalion Commander Wei had agreed to disarm, but all the soldiers refused to obey. Except for a very small number who were disarmed, they all automatically went to the mountains and headed for the China Eastern Railway, concentrating in the various counties of Wuchang. Domon saw that the deadline he had set had passed, so he changed the deadline to 12:00 noon on the 28th.</p>
<p>Advancing into Dunhua and rushing to build the Ji-Hui Railway. The Japanese army occupied Jilin without any resistance, which was not what they had expected. According to investigations, the number of Japanese soldiers was only 1,400, and the rest were filled by local Japanese residents. Since Jilin had not changed, they began to feel at ease and boldly occupied the Jidun Railway. Japanese soldiers were stationed at all the strategic stations along the way. At 4:30 p.m. on the 21st, they arrived at Jiaohe Station. After the Japanese army arrived, they erected machine guns and artillery at the station entrance and demonstrated to the citizens. They confiscated the guns of the police, but no one had been killed yet. The searches were very strict, and the slightest carelessness would result in severe beatings. I saw with my own eyes a farmer on the platform being beaten unconscious. The next morning, 50 soldiers were stationed in Jiaohe, and about 250 were stationed in Jidun. After arriving in Dunhua, they first disarmed the police and confiscated part of the security regiment. Many were beaten and humiliated. When the Japanese soldiers arrived in Dunhua, they brought many engineers with them. They immediately carried out surveying work, intending to rush to build the Ji-Hui Railway in order to achieve their continental policy ambitions. Their purpose in anxiously planning for our Jilin lies here. After the Japanese soldiers occupied the Jidun and Jichang Railways, purchases were prohibited unless they were made with cash. In addition to cash silver dollars and gold notes, nothing else could be used. It cost at least three yuan to exchange Hanyang dollars for silver dollars, and there was nowhere to buy them. Official notes were even more worthless, so businesses dared not sell goods, and people without cash were even more miserable. Prices were expensive and rose several times a day, and the citizens cried out in distress. Air reconnaissance and aerial demonstrations. After the Japanese soldiers occupied the various strategic locations, such as the Beida Mountain Fortress, Xiaobaishan, and Shanzai, they erected artillery pieces aimed at Jilin City and said that if there was resistance, they would destroy the provincial capital with artillery. In addition, two planes flew in the air every morning and evening to reconnoiter everything, making people feel even more uneasy. Only people fleeing and moving were seen on the streets.</p>

<p>On the Tone of the Manchurian Incident</p>
<p>Since the Soviet Union borders our country and is also Japan's formidable rival in Manchuria, readers would surely be eager to know what attitude the Soviet government and people hold toward the current Manchurian Incident. Here, we translate the editorial published on the 23rd of this month by *Pravda* (Нправда), the mouthpiece of the Soviet Central Committee, to gain a glimpse into the attitude of the Soviet government and people. (The following is the translated text)</p>
<p>"Japanese troops have already occupied Liaoning, completely seizing important locations along the South Manchurian Railway line, and detaining all administrative officials of the Liaoning government, except for Zhang Xueliang, the Northeast leader currently stationed in Beiping. Japan has also occupied the Liaoning arsenal and all important banks, and has completely brought all military fortresses along the South Manchurian Railway line under Japanese military control. This occurred under the pretext of Chinese troops destroying the railway line. However, Japan did not notify the Nanjing government or warn the Liaoning authorities before dispatching troops. Therefore, Zhang Xueliang has ordered his troops not to resist. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese warlords have clearly shown submission to Japanese military force. The dispatch of troops to the South Manchurian Railway line by Japanese imperialism is not accidental; it has been prepared for years. Japanese imperialists want to consolidate their previously acquired position in Manchuria to expand their economic and political privileges. Japan also wants to obtain the right to build new railways and stop Chinese capitalists from building railways and commercial ports. Its aim is to completely supervise the financial organization of the three eastern provinces. Japanese imperialists have clearly indicated that they will expand their influence into Mongolia.</p>
<p>The formal recognition of the Nanjing government as the central government by Liaoning has aroused resolute protests from Japanese imperialists. Japan believes that this is because the Liaoning government will rely on Nanjing as a protective charm to break free from Japan's restraints. The Liaoning government's implementation of the construction of a military port (referring to Huludao) further intensifies the Japanese imperialists' conspiracy. Japanese troops have now occupied the capital of the three eastern provinces (Shenyang), while the League of Nations conference is being held in Geneva. Japan and China are both members of the League of Nations, and the Chinese representative has even joined the Council of the League as a director. However, it is a fact that we can imagine that the League of Nations will gladly accept the notification from the Japanese representative Yoshizawa. Therefore, the League of Nations is a weapon of imperialists, which is further confirmed here.</p>
<p>Japan is one of the countries that joined the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and China has also signed the pact. However, the pact still cannot prevent Japan from taking military action against another participant in the pact (China). The Washington Foreign Ministry declaration even stated that the Manchurian Incident is a local incident and cannot be used as a basis for violating the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Alas, the initiator of the pact is now disregarding its own creation.</p>
<p>Workers all over the world can understand the value of the League of Nations being regarded as a tool of peace, and the value of the Kellogg-Briand Pact being considered capable of guaranteeing against new wars.</p>
<p>In summary, the occupation of important locations on the South Manchurian Railway line and the capital of the three eastern provinces (Shenyang) by Japanese troops is a manifestation of the conspiracy of Japanese imperialists. In the three eastern provinces where military action has occurred, the interests of various imperialists, such as the United States, Britain, France, have always been in conflict. The Manchurian Incident will make the conflict even more tense.</p>
<p>Soviet workers should pay close attention to the events currently taking place in South Manchuria." (From Chita, September 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Situation of Japanese Troops Occupying Taonan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Taonan Correspondence: Since the Japanese invading army launched its attack and took over the Siping-Taonan Railway, its military actions have been arbitrary and devastating. On September 24th, the Japanese troops arrived at Zhengjiatun, with a momentum to drive straight into Taonan. The officials and people of Taonan were greatly panicked. In order to avoid conflict, the local government preemptively ordered the military police stationed there to withdraw, stating that if the Japanese troops came, they would be treated with courtesy. If necessary, other methods would be used to deal with them. Therefore, the people all knew that the arrival of the Japanese troops would inevitably lead to a surrender, and the people's hearts became even more fearful. Many people fled. Moreover, it was the time of the old lunar autumn festival, and merchants were in the midst of their busiest season for business and settling accounts. Seeing this tense situation, they dared not enter the city to shop, causing great damage to the merchants. At 9:00 AM on the 26th, Japanese military planes circled over and around Taonan City for about ten minutes, dropping two bombs, which fortunately landed in open areas and did not injure anyone. On the evening of the same day, at about 4:00 PM, about 500 Japanese soldiers arrived from the Siping-Taonan Railway. Half of them remained at the train station, and the other half entered the city, about 200 soldiers fully armed. The soldiers marched on foot, and cannons and machine guns were all equipped. After entering the city, they forcibly pulled the local authorities to inquire about everything. The next morning, they returned to Zhengjiatun. After some time, another plane came and circled within the city, paying the most attention to the vicinity of the government offices. Moreover, it flew very low, and its shape and color could be distinguished. It circled for more than an hour and flew south. Since then, until the time of publication, there have been no other actions. Currently, the market is extremely panicked, the currency is scarce, and prices are soaring. Banks and money houses have stopped remittances. As for newspapers, although newspapers from other provinces have not yet been cut off, the arrival date is uncertain. The Liaoning-based *Three Eastern Provinces Daily* and *New People's Evening News* have not been seen for many days. (September 28th)</p>

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the news of the Japanese troops' invasion and occupation of Liaoning and Jilin spread to Fuzhou, the public has been very indignant. The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting of various trade guilds on the 27th and 28th to discuss thorough ways to boycott Japanese goods. More than 400 representatives attended, and the atmosphere was tense throughout the meeting. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to organize the Minhou Business Community Anti-Japanese Association and draft an oath stating: "We, the members of the business community, solemnly swear with utmost sincerity that from today onwards, we will no longer import Japanese goods and will implement economic severance with Japan. If we violate the oath or act insincerely, we are willing to accept the capital punishment of the community." The oath was unanimously signed by all the representatives present, with a deadline of three days to supplement the association's charter; otherwise, their names would be published and left to the community's judgment. At the same time, money houses and banks were notified not to have dealings with Japanese merchants, and letters were sent to the dock and barge labor unions and the customs declaration association not to load or unload goods for Japanese ships or pay customs duties on their behalf. The Anti-Japanese Association has already started working in the County Chamber of Commerce on the 29th, and Chen Konggu, a member of the County Chamber of Commerce, was recommended to join the Provincial Anti-Japanese Association to proceed together.</p>
<p>In addition, the provincial and county party departments also initiated the organization of a Party Member Volunteer Corps to implement military training. In addition to all the staff of the provincial and county party departments joining, party members are also enthusiastically signing up to participate. Organizational regulations and training courses are being drafted, and they should be announced soon. (September 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">A Record of Inspecting Haizhou Port <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Xuzhou reporters' group, because of the continuous rumors in Xuzhou regarding Japanese warships arriving in Haizhou and marines landing, the truth was unknown. Therefore, on the 30th, they set off for Haizhou. They departed at 8:00 AM and arrived in Xinpu that evening. On the first day, they visited the 95th Brigade headquarters of the 25th Route Army stationed in Xinpu and the Donghai County government. On the second day, they accompanied personnel from the 95th Brigade headquarters to inspect the seaports in Xugou and Dapu. On the morning of the third day, they set off to return west and arrived in Xuzhou that evening. The inspection situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Haizhou Port Situation: Haizhou is 400 li from Xuzhou, located by the sea, abundant in fishing and salt. The Haizhou County seat is located south of the Longhai Railway, about 5 li from the station, backed by Jinping Mountain and surrounded by the Qiangwei River to the north, with advantageous terrain. 12 li east of the county is Xinpu, the so-called Haizhou commercial port area. It is a newly developed area where merchants gather. Between Xinpu and the county seat, it was formerly called Linhongtan, which used to be a beach but later dried up. 18 li northeast of Xinpu is Dapu, a small harbor where seawater enters the land. There is a Sanyang Shipping Company pier. However, due to shallow water, only small ships can enter, not large ones. The whole port is crisscrossed with salt ponds and warehouses. The Longhai Railway ends here. 60 li southeast of Xinpu is Xugou, a key coastal area. East of Xugou is Xilian Island, where our government plans to develop a port. 70 li northeast of Xinpu is Qingkou, also an important coastal town. These four locations form an oblique triangle. The temporary port is centered on Dapu, and after the port is developed, it will be completely moved to Xugou. At that time, the Longhai Railway will also extend past Dapu to here. Currently, the defense of the Haizhou port is entirely the responsibility of the 95th Brigade. The brigade headquarters is located in Xinpu, and its two regiments are stationed in key areas: the 283rd Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Jiang Xiuren, is stationed in Donghai County, and the 284th Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Wang Dehong, is stationed in Xin'an Town.</p>
<p>Visiting the Brigade Headquarters: On the morning of the first day, I visited the 95th Brigade headquarters. Brigade Commander Liu Guoming had just been summoned to Qingjiang by Division Commander Liang to discuss defense matters, and Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang Zixing received me. According to him, the brigade headquarters received a report on the 25th of last month that a Japanese warship had been spotted outside Qingkou and Linhongkou. They immediately sent scouts to investigate the coast. At the same time, they also received a similar report from the County Public Security Bureau. Therefore, on the 26th, they dispatched additional troops to strengthen the defense of Dapu, Xugou, and Qingkou. A few days ago, Chief Commander Liang also telegraphed an order to be strictly vigilant. According to my observation, the Japanese warship may have been spying outside our harbor, but it was unable to land due to the shallow water. According to international law, Japanese warships and sailors have no reason to land. However, in view of the violence of the Japanese military, we cannot but take appropriate precautions. This brigade has a responsibility to defend the territory. If a Japanese warship suddenly arrives, it will resolutely use force to stop it. A few days ago, the Japanese shipowner Xie Dingyi, manager of Yuxingyong, a Japanese merchant ship in Dapu, contacted this brigade to ask if Japanese people could be allowed to come to the port. This brigade immediately refused because if Japanese expatriates were allowed to come to the port, they would use the pretext of protecting expatriates, which would be unmanageable. In the afternoon, I visited the Donghai County government. County Magistrate Zhang Fengzhou had left to suppress bandits and had not returned. According to Secretary Bao, on the 27th, a report was received that a Japanese warship was sailing outside Grandma Mountain. The color of the ship was yellow above and gray below. When the news came, the people of Haizhou were quite alarmed. They then reported to the 95th Brigade headquarters, which dispatched a team to strengthen the defense of the harbor. The Japanese warship then left. The market has been stable for several days. However, there are many bandit problems in Haizhou. In the south, there is Liu Dashui's gang, and in the north, there are remnants of Liu Hei Qi's gang, which are quite a problem for the local area and still need to be suppressed. The 95th Brigade is stationed in Haizhou and has excellent discipline. The local people have great faith in them.</p>
<p>Xugou Inspection: At 9:00 AM on the morning of the second day, I, along with Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang Zixing of the 95th Brigade and Chief of Staff Bian Jiyun, took a car to Xugou for inspection. The car traveled for three hours and arrived. I invited the village chief of Xugou, Tongfu, to walk to the seaside to inspect. Xugou is a coastal village, and outside the village is Haitou Bay. The coastline is winding, forming a semi-circular shape. Connecting to the north of Xugou is Beigu Mountain, and connecting to the south of Xugou is Yuntai Mountain Sunjia Mountain, isolated between Beigu Mountain and Sunjia Mountain. Looking east from Xugou, across the sea for more than ten li, there is Xilian Island, which can be reached by a reed. The island is about eight or nine li long. At the foot of the mountain, there are red foreign houses built by foreigners, about seven or eight of them, which can be clearly seen with binoculars. According to Mr. Wang, after the Longhai Railway was built, two French and Belgian engineers, Fang Lingde Burke and Shudeka Lara, surveyed the island for three years and made accurate calculations of water depth and tides. Unfortunately, the engineers were absolutely secretive and refused to publish their findings. The coastal villagers only know to go back and forth to catch fish and cannot calculate the tide. Recently, Japanese ships have been fishing near our island, and the fishing industry has been deprived a lot. Currently, Haizhou Middle School has a Fishery Village Normal Department in Xugou and is about to start development, but the fishing equipment is not sophisticated, and the fishermen dare not venture deep into the ocean. The general name of Xilian Island is Yingyou Mountain. At the southern end of the mountain, opposite Sunjia Mountain, the water is cut off, called Yingyou Gate. The sea surface to the north is wider, facing Beigu Mountain from afar. The mountain at the northern end of Beigu Mountain extends into the sea, and the locals call it Bai Zui, facing Xilian Island from east to west. Climbing up and looking into the distance, the sea is wide and the sky is vast, with sailboats dotted everywhere. The foot of the mountain is as flat as a sandbar. A good port is yet to be developed. At this time, Battalion Commander Geng came to visit Deputy Brigade Commander Zhang. Zhang visited the factory as instructed. After about two hours of inspection, he said goodbye to Mr. Zhang and Bian and took a car to Dapu with Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>Dapu Situation: Traveling east from Xugou for two hours, we arrived at Dapu. This is a harbor where seawater enters the inland. The water surface is extremely narrow, and large ships cannot enter, only small ones. There are many Sanyang piers. There are many salt factories in the harbor, and ships and sails gather like ants. According to Battalion Adjutant Zhao, the merchant ship Yuantai, converted from a Japanese warship, came here on the 24th. It sailed away the next day. On the 29th, it docked at the Sanyang pier again. Scouts were sent to monitor it and prohibit it from landing. It then sailed away. It has not come in recent days. Rumors of Japanese troops landing are probably based on this. Because the merchant ship was converted from a warship, its form is naturally different from ordinary merchant ships. Linhongkou is 40 li northeast of Dapu. A Japanese warship had passed outside the port a few days ago, but it did not land. At 5:00 PM, we took a car back to Xinpu. Since Qingkou was far away, we did not go there. Chief of Staff Shi Xianting of the 95th Brigade had just come from Qingkou. It was heard that the troops stationed there had built fortifications outside Qingkou, similar to the deployment in Dapu, which was also very strict. In addition to inspecting the harbor, the reporters' group saw that the disaster situation in the Xuzhou-Haizhou area was very serious along the way. On both sides of the railway, the land was submerged. The newly dried-up sorghum was dry and withered, and the branches and leaves were piled up in the fields. The roadbeds on the east and west sides of the canal station were dug by farmers in several places when the water rose to drain the water. Currently, they are supported by soil bags or sleepers, with clear traces. Disaster victims are everywhere, which is distressing. I hope that people from all walks of life will not neglect disaster relief while saving the country. (October 4th)</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang's Remarks on the Boat: Xiamen Correspondence: Mr. Zhang Puquan and Cai Jiemin recently went to Guangzhou in person to negotiate and promote cooperation between Nanjing and Guangdong. The two gentlemen boarded the Zhishadani, a ship of the Java-China-Japan Lijn, at the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai at about 8:00 AM on the 24th. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at 10:00 AM that day, but it received a report from the observatory that a strong wind was approaching outside the mouth of the Yangtze River. To avoid danger, it did not set sail and was postponed until 11:00 AM on the 25th before leaving the port. The reporter also took the ship south. In the afternoon of the 26th, I went to meet Mr. Zhang. At that time, Mr. Zhang was reading a book, and Mr. Cai was busy writing. Mr. Zhang was full of energy and greeted people with joy. The reporter asked about the mission and hopes for going to Guangdong. Mr. Zhang replied that at a time of tense diplomacy, the Kuomintang comrades should unite urgently, and the people of the whole country should also cooperate to relieve the national crisis. The central government's intention of peace is sincere. Guangdong is the birthplace of the revolution. The comrades in Guangzhou should be able to put the interests of the country above everything else and make sacrifices. Therefore, the brothers are very optimistic about the future of peace on this trip. The comrades in Guangzhou said that they would only know after the brothers arrived in Guangzhou. The plan for this trip is to go to Hong Kong first, stay for a while, and then go to Guangzhou, and return to Nanjing in about a week. Chen Mingshu is also traveling with them to Guangzhou to participate in the peace process. The reporter then met Chen Mingshu. Chen was chatting with his entourage. When asked about the peace process, Chen did not express his opinion. He said that he was going to Hong Kong, not Guangzhou, and said nothing else. It is reported that the welcoming representatives from Guangzhou have arrived in Hong Kong. It is expected that the outcome of this trip by Zhang and Cai will be satisfactory. However, the Zhishadani arrived in Xiamen today (27th) and will not arrive in Hong Kong until the morning of the 28th. It is also heard that after Zhang and Cai arrive in Hong Kong, they plan to visit Xu Chongzhi and others. (September 27th)</p>

<p>Pan Fugeng Executed in Suzhou: Pan Fugeng, a native of Wujin, was 35 years old. He was familiar with Sun Laosi, a foreman at the Hefeng Iron Factory in Shanghai. Sun had a feud with Zhang Hongen, who replaced him as foreman. In August of the 18th year, he secretly discussed assassinating Zhang Hongen with Pan at the Chunhe Tea Garden in Yangshupu, promising to pay him 200 yuan as remuneration after the event. He handed him a pistol and seven bullets. Later, on the night of the 17th of the same month, Pan shot Zhang five times, killing him. The Shanghai Local Court sentenced Pan to death. Pan refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court. The three-trial conclusion still followed the original judgment. Yesterday (5th), the Higher Procuratorate executed Pan by hanging at the execution ground of the Third Division of the Sishi Qian Street in Suzhou.</p>

<p>Petition to Restore County-Run Zhaonan School: The county-run Zhaonan Primary School was founded more than ten years ago. It has always had excellent performance and developed well. However, the former principal of the school, Cai Zaoshi, and the current principal, Tang Pinlin, were successively falsely accused of being reactionary, causing the County Education Bureau to claim that the school's environment was poor and to shut it down. Dozens of relatives of the students of the school, including Lu Renxian, believed that the school had a good record and should not be closed. Yesterday, they specially elected six representatives and jointly submitted a petition to the county government and the Education Bureau, and the county government agreed to find a way to restore it to comply with public opinion.</p>

It was resolved that the funding for repairing the dam concerned the water conservancy of various counties in Jiangnan and should be allocated by the province from the construction water conservancy funding. Before the provincial funds are allocated, or because the matter is urgent and needs to be handled immediately, the relevant counties can find ways to temporarily advance the funds. The amount required should be jointly estimated by the construction bureaus of the relevant counties, and agreed upon by the counties before being apportioned. Chen Zhanru was recommended as the representative to petition the province.</p>

<p>Tragic Incident Beside the Tingzi Bridge: At 6:00 PM the night before, when the Yeqin Yarn Factory outside the East Gate released its workers, worker Zhou Rongda and his younger sister Erda went home together from the factory. When passing near the Tingzi Bridge, several workers from the Iron Factory saw that Erda was attractive and followed her relentlessly, uttering obscene words and teasing her. Seeing this, Rongda questioned them, but the Iron Factory workers became angry out of shame and blew their whistle to summon forty or fifty workers from the same factory, armed with axes, iron rulers, and other weapons, to surround Rongda and beat him. He was slashed in the back of the head with an axe, and he fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. At the same time, Chen Jinlin was also beaten, and his right thigh was stabbed with a knife, forming a large hole. Chen Sanquan was also beaten and covered with wounds, foaming at the mouth, and fell unconscious to the ground. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the Iron Factory workers dispersed.

From October 16th to November 15th is the date for sealing up all Japanese goods in the city. If Japanese goods are found again after the deadline, in addition to confiscation, the punishment will be doubled. However, coal is a daily necessity and also has the nature of a raw material. From now on, imports and exports will be suspended, and only retail sales will be allowed in this port. The Western medicine industry sells Japanese goods worth about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per month. Now it has decided to sacrifice business and seal them up voluntarily.</p>

<p>Following Orders to Intensify Military Training</p>
<p>Yesterday, the high schools and above in Henan Province received a telegram from the Education Department stating: "The nation is in turmoil, disasters are frequent, the people's livelihood is declining, and the national situation is precarious. The ferocious Japanese are taking advantage of our lack of time to seek survival and rescue and suddenly occupying our Liaoning and Jilin with a large army, successively seizing key coastal defense areas, nibbling and swallowing, advancing steadily with the intention of destroying our motherland. War is inevitable. If we do not rise up and defend ourselves, we will be at the mercy of others, and the disaster of national subjugation may be imminent. Our country has a population of about 500 million, with many壮丁, but we have not paid enough attention to military education, and there is a particular lack of junior officers. Schools above the high school level have always had military training courses. In this time of great crisis, we must intensify training to cultivate military cadres to save the nation." In addition to issuing separate orders, the communication urged the schools to immediately intensify training on the original military training curriculum, prepare to be reviewed by the provincial government at a set time, and not neglect the important matter. After receiving the orders, the schools have already begun actively carrying out intensified training day and night.</p>

<p>Continuation of Yesterday's Results on Cultural Cooperation Matters</p>
<p>(C) After receiving a letter from the Chinese Ministry of Education, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations immediately replied and notified the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation and the International Educational Cinematographic Institute to prepare a detailed record of work, especially focusing on the nature of the cooperation they could provide to China. Secondly, the Vice-President of the Executive Yuan of the Chinese Government telegraphed requesting that all specialized organizations of the League of Nations be in an advisory position to help formulate and implement the Chinese Government's planned reconstruction of China. Regarding the specific scope of education, the Chinese Government also stated, "In addition, the international community can help the Chinese Government find consultants to promote the improvement of China's education system and facilitate communication between the cultural centers of China and foreign countries." After multiple discussions between the Chairman of the Intellectual Cooperation Committee, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and the Director-General of the Institute, it was decided to form a group of experts to go to China to investigate the education system. (China requested that the League of Nations form a committee to investigate) and go to China before the end of the year. The organization of the committee will be based on the suggestions of the three parties. The Chairman of the Cooperation Committee appointed the members of the group: Mr. Karl Becker, Professor at the University of Berlin and former Prussian Minister of Education; Mr. Waalsky, Professor of Linguistics and head of the Polish Ministry of Education; Mr. Langevin, Professor at the French Academy; Mr. Donnay, Professor at the University of London. The Secretary-General also agreed to appoint Mr. Walters, Chief of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, as a special advisor to the committee. Finally, after consultation, the Intellectual Cooperation Committee agreed that Mr. Thain, Director-General of the Institute, would join the committee in China to participate in the later stages of the committee's work and help prepare the final report. Furthermore, the status of cooperation between the League of Nations Committee and the Chinese authorities must be made clear to the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation at all times. The committee met in Geneva on July 18 to present to the Executive Committee the principles they considered should be adopted during the inspection trip. Their first desire was to find ways for China to gradually adapt to the new circumstances in its great cultural tradition. The members of the committee also resolved on resolutions concerning the preparation of the committee: (A) Prepare preliminary proposals based on the materials already available for experts to refer to; (B) Prepare a collection of questions before departure, hoping to obtain preliminary reference materials upon arrival in Nanjing to facilitate the work. Before August 1, each member of the committee should send all the questions they want to be included in the collection of questions to the Secretariat so that Dr. Raczymon can forward them to the relevant authorities. He is currently on a special mission for the League of Nations in China, and Dr. Raczymon is entrusted to ensure that the materials are complete and ready when the committee arrives in China; (C) (D) Omitted; (2) Resolutions on the final report of the committee: (A) A report containing the committee's views on the best way to improve the education system; (B) A report on methods to promote communication between China and foreign cultural centers. The report should include recommendations for China and the Intellectual Cooperation Organization. Regarding the latter, it should provide various materials as a basis for future operations, so as to provide the Chinese government with permanent and practical assistance. The committee members should pay attention to the fact that this preliminary work has been effective. For example, the committee is scheduled to depart at the end of August, and professors will be sent to the Central University at the beginning of the next academic year. The committee not only provides opinions on the measures that have been taken, but also on the projects that should be carried out in the future. Within the scope of the Chinese government's willingness, efforts should be made to expand the projects that have already been carried out by the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation based on the Chinese government's request.

<p>Simultaneous Progress in National Salvation and Studying</p>
<p>The entire school, including teachers, students, and workers, is united.</p>
<p>This week is Propaganda and Military Training Week.</p>
<p>Jinan University's anti-Japanese work is very enthusiastic. The entire school, including teachers, students, and workers, is deeply concerned that this national salvation movement will repeat the old mistakes and soon disappear and become silent. At the same time, they must also consider the issue of studying. As of yesterday (5th), all departments of the university resumed classes, but in addition to the class time from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM every day, 6:20 AM to 7:30 AM and 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM are designated as propaganda and military training time. Teachers, students, and workers are organized separately to implement these measures in a serious manner. At the school's memorial service yesterday morning, Principal Zheng Hongnian gave detailed instructions on using academics to fundamentally save the country and on the lasting spirit of the patriotic movement.

<p>Closes Two Private Schools, Qizhi and Xinhua</p>
<p>The school building of the private Qizhi Primary School on Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road, has only one classroom. There are family shrines and kitchen god statues on the walls of the room. However, the school's regulations divide it into commercial English special courses, junior high school, senior primary school, junior primary school, women's English typing courses, telephone operator courses, and women's compulsory night schools. The school also has a Xinhua Righteous School building attached to Qingyun Lane on North Sichuan Road, which also has only one room with no equipment other than a few broken bamboo chairs. The courses taught include both Mandarin and literature, as well as exposition, correspondence, question-and-answer, and reply writing, which are completely inconsistent with the standards set by the Ministry. Principal Peng Huilian's teaching methods are the same as those of various烘schools. Although the簡章stipulates that each student pays a school fee of four yuan every six months, it cleverly sets up various names to attract and deceive students. Recently, the City Education Bureau learned that the school was similar to a business and that students from afar were easily deceived. It specially sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court to send police to close the two schools to avoid misleading children.</p>

The Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation invited top-tier tennis players from Malaya, Tianjin, and Shanghai to hold a charity tennis performance. Four players from Malaya include Lim Fong-Soo, a leader among heroes, whose talent and reputation rival Lin Chiu. Yeung Lun-Cheung, the runner-up in Malayan tennis, also possesses extraordinary skill. Furthermore, if Chung Chee-Lam and Fung Chit-Kwan are indeed skilled players, then Tianjin, with national player Lin Po-Wah as its cornerstone, supplemented by Ko Wai-Man's agility, undoubtedly possesses formidable strength. Shanghai's Chiu Hoi-Fei and Kong Tao-Cheung, two great generals, one assertive and one gentle, are a natural match. The outcome of the singles competition is unpredictable, but they are certainly confident in the doubles. It is regrettable that Hong Kong's star players Law Man-Wai and Ho Ka-Lau are not participating; otherwise, the rankings of the top ten players in China might be determined here.</p>

These include four to five hundred students from Wuben Girls' High School, over three hundred students from Minli Middle School, over eighty trainees from the Local Autonomy Training Institute, and two to three hundred members of the Nanshi Defense Corps. The sound of marching, commands, and bugles are all powerful, showing a glimpse of the city's spirit of resisting Japan and saving the nation. However, the small space and large number of people make it difficult to form lines and change formations. It is said that starting next week, the volunteer army organized by the Municipal Party Headquarters also plans to come to the field for training.</p>

<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, we all know the word "total." It contains the meaning of being lofty, great, and encompassing everything. For example, "premier," "commander-in-chief," "president," "chief," "general organization," and "central organ" are all very dignified terms. Who would have known that this time, the violent Japanese suddenly became beastly, invading our Northeast, and actually carrying out a total disarmament of our country's military and police in the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin. Let us try to discern the meaning of this word "total." It is truly as bitter as Coptis chinensis and as spicy as ginger and mustard. Now that things have come to this, how shall we strive to become strong, in order to prepare for the day when the whole country is totally united and the whole people are totally mobilized, and settle accounts with the violent Japanese? Only then can we wash away this unprecedented shame of total disarmament.</p>

<h3 id="e116">A Chinese Hero in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yang</p>
<p>Recently, the violent Japanese have invaded our Eastern Provinces. After feeling indignant, our countrymen have been recalling the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Among those who have written accounts, I know of one Xu Shaoquan, who also died in that war with a strong desire to serve his country. Xu was just a young man in his twenties, married for only two months. He went to his death generously, which is praiseworthy. It is a pity that he was a minor official and no one paid attention to him, so his name has been lost. Now, based on the family biography of Mr. Xu written by my friend Luo Yongjun, I will extract the facts as follows. At this time of national crisis, Mr. Xu may be a good model for those who die later. Xu Liang, also known as Xi Yan, courtesy name Shaoquan, was from Qianmen Village, Xijiao, Dongting East Mountain, Wu County, Jiangsu Province. His father, Xinquan, had two sons, with Shaoquan being the eldest. From a young age, he was generous and had great ambitions. At the age of ten, he heard his maternal grandfather talk about the recruitment of the Beiyang Naval Academy in Tianjin, and he happily wanted to respond to the recruitment. His family dissuaded him because he was young and his father was away in Tianjin as a merchant, and there was a lack of people at home to help. Shaoquan ultimately did not listen. His family also praised his ambition and reluctantly allowed him to go north with his maternal grandfather to apply to the school. This was in February of the ninth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. After entering the school, he studied diligently and often ranked at the top in exams. He sent all the prize money he received to his mother to help with household expenses. Thirteen World Minor Affairs</p>
<p>The Reasoning of Gorillas Is Not</p>
<p>Long Ago, There Was a</p>
<p>British scientist who wanted to study whether gorillas have human reasoning. He went to the zoo and hung a banana on the bars of a gorilla's cage. The banana was beyond the reach of the gorilla's hands. At the same time, he agreed with the keeper to put two or three wooden boxes in the cage. The gorilla sat there blankly, thinking for a while. Finally, it stacked the wooden boxes one by one. It jumped onto the highest box and finally got the banana. This shows that gorillas have thoughts and reasoning, just like humans. The scientist still thought it was not enough and did a second experiment. He thought that if the gorilla saw that no one was watching, it might think faster. Therefore, he locked the gorilla in a room. He himself went outside the door and tried to peek at its actions through the keyhole. As soon as he put one eye to the keyhole in the door, he saw a pair of bright eyes inside, also looking at him. It turned out that the gorilla was also trying to peek at him, just like him. After these two experiments, the scientist knew that gorillas did indeed have human reasoning. If he could find a way to educate them, they might have considerable success. In October of the tenth year, after completing his studies at the school, he was awarded the fifth-rank military rank by the Minister of Beiyang, Li, and was recommended to the Ministry for appointment as a Battalion Commander with priority. In May of the seventeenth year, he was appointed as the third officer of the Pingyuan ship's machinery. In June of the eighteenth year, he was transferred to act as the training deputy officer of the Kangji ship. In the winter of the nineteenth year, he returned to the south at his mother's call and married Ms. Weng. Two months after the marriage, the Sino-Japanese conflict arose. Shaoquan wanted to go north, but his family and relatives all dissuaded him, thinking that China's war with Japan was like hitting a stone with an egg, and there would be nothing but defeat. Participating in it would only hurt everyone's life. Shaoquan resolutely said, "Everything I have today, is it not all given to me by the country? Now that the country is in difficulty, if I do not risk my life to go forward, even if I keep this body, how can I face people?" So he went north. In June of the twentieth year, he was appointed as the Garrison Commander of the Left Camp of the Right Wing of the Beiyang Navy, and concurrently served as the Deputy Officer of the Liyuan ship's torpedoes. On August 18th, he engaged in battle with the Japanese in the waters of Dadonggou and was hit by a cannon, thus dying in battle. By imperial decree, he was given a four hundred taels of silver pension according to the example of a Guerrilla General who died in battle, and was posthumously awarded the title of Guerrilla General with preferential treatment. Initially, when Shaoquan applied to the Beiyang Naval Academy, the school stipulated that the application age must be above sixteen. At that time, Shaoquan was only eleven years old. Fearing rejection, he falsely claimed to be of age before coming of age, so that he could enter the school. When he met with disaster, he was only twenty-two years old. Because he falsely increased his age by four years when registering, he was then referred to as twenty-six years old.</p>
<h3 id="e117">A Letter Regarding the Lake Pavilion Poetry Lessons <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Shen Yuanci of Yangzhou</p>
<p>I received your letter. Your insightful and grand plans are admirable. The Lake Pavilion Poetry Lessons were originally designed for young children to learn poetry. They are recorded for readers to teach their children, to help them pass the summer. The attached examples of how to fill in the tones are no different from guessing riddles. The gift of a small prize is only for the sake of the children. Originally, it was intended to give each child a toothbrush or a box of toothpaste, as a form of health promotion. Initially, I did not expect old and new friends to misunderstand it as a literary gathering. For a time, the clouds gathered and the rainbows sang together. Considering its purpose, it is just like taking a mock exam. The writing follows the inspiration and does not compete with scholars for fame. Therefore, Xu does not dare to continue using the name "Poetry Lessons" and instead uses "Poetry Talks" to avoid self-promotion. However, there are more than six hundred entries. Considering it from a human perspective, I am afraid of ruining people's good mood. Therefore, I set a rule that it should not harm thriftiness or generosity. I took the opportunity to introduce domestic goods. Although it is a company's business, Xu has never been generous at the expense of others. Therefore, I calculated according to the lowest value and charged half the price, making up for the shortfall myself. Suppose each of the six hundred volumes has five identical characters, and I take five yuan of goods each time. Using the lowest wholesale price as 60%, it would still cost three hundred yuan. After collecting two thousand five hundred yuan, Xu still has to pay five hundred yuan in compensation. I ask myself and feel quite unashamed. However, according to your wonderful calculation, if all six hundred volumes were like yours, then I would have to give away more than half a million in gold, which I, a mere scholar, cannot help but tongue-tie. Because in the four seven-character quatrains, besides the original fifty-eight characters, only fifty-four characters are filled in, yet they require the value of five thousand four hundred gold, compared to how the Changmen Fu is priced. Xu sincerely cannot understand what use these fifty-four characters have, that they are so precious. Therefore, I am sorry that I cannot follow your method.</p>

<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>Strange to say! Tao Chi, who wasn't sitting in a wheelchair, had a very modern family; his father was a railway engineer; his mother was a female lawyer; his fiancée was a female social worker in a bank. Once he was in the wheelchair, his family changed too! His father was an old-fashioned licentiate; his mother was an old woman who knew a little bit of how to read but who did not know many characters and only looked at blind poems and sing them but did not care about wrong characters; his fiancée was nowhere to be found; but, in his vast and swirling emotions, there was a beautiful maiden, entrenched in his heart.</p>
<p>That beautiful maiden, though in her boudoir waiting to be betrothed, has not had an ideal husband shoot down the screen to select the son-in-law; but, Tao Chi dared not hope for impropriety, only because the difference in status was too great! He was the son of the old fashioned licentiate Tao, and the beautiful maiden was Miss Tang Xiuying, the daughter of Tang Junmen, the current Shandong regional commander. Like this divide of clouds and mud, unless Miss Tang Xiuying learns from the daughters of wealthy families and throws the embroidered ball and hits Tao Chi, only then could this mismatched marriage be made; if not, there is no possibility of Tao Chi getting engaged to Miss Tang Xiuying.</p>
<p>Tao Chi never went to study with a teacher outside, and all that he received was domestic teaching. From the time he started reading until the time he carried the examination basket to take the test, all of it was personally taught by his father Tao. He had a childhood friend, surnamed Pei, named Shi, whose talent was above Tao Chi; however, his interests were completely different. Tao Chi was a believer in the eight-legged essay, but Pei Shi was a traitor of the eight-legged essay. When the Licentiate Tao spoke to them of eight-legged essays, Tao Chi listened with relish, but Pei Shi only yawned a couple of times! Taking advantage of Licentiate Tao leaving, Pei Shi would sneak to the carpenter's house next door to see how they used knives and awls. After watching twice, he was able to understand, went home and asked his father for money, only to say that the teacher told him to buy books. He cheated for the book money, did not buy the books, but bought knives and awls, and worked hard on carpentry while Licentiate Tao's was not looking in the study; he carved a small person an inch long, with mechanisms installed inside, which he placed on the desk and could walk; when writing, he could order the small wooden person to take a water bowl and fetch water, and pour it on the inkstone; The students and teenagers were amazed, but Licentiate Tao found out, took the small wooden person, threw it on the ground, and stomped on it a few times, bitterly complaining about the eight-legged traitor:</p>
<p>"You child, you can't be taught! You don't focus on your career, but you work hard on carpentry, and it's very unlikely you will improve. The system of the former kings killed those who practice weird skills; my boy, you have a little talent but you haven't heard of the great way of the gentleman, it's enough to kill your body!"</p>

<h3 id="e119">Gold Price Falls Sixteen Taels <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The American Gold and Silver Parity Rumor: Yesterday, on the 5th, the gold market suddenly experienced a downturn. The state of affairs was weak and hesitant, like being caught in a storm, unsure of whether to advance or retreat. Prices fluctuated, sometimes by two or three taels, sometimes by six or seven, with a total daily difference of seventeen taels. In the end, there was a sharp drop of more than sixteen taels. The market was filled with selling pressure, and confidence was weak. It was said that the overseas silver market suddenly rose, leading to a lower opening. Later, large players reportedly sold off their holdings, with rumors that Citibank was advocating for a gold and silver parity, causing both gold and silver prices to fall. In particular, the exchange rate, both official and unofficial, eased considerably, leading to a precipitous decline of more than ten taels. Suddenly, the price broke through 720 taels. The market outlook is unstable, fluctuating around 20 taels, and ultimately weakening further.</p>
<p>Opening Drops Five and a Half Taels: The opening price this morning, around 11 or 12 o'clock, dropped five and a half taels, to 727 taels.

Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Cui Chang Yong, Da Xing Yong, Yong Feng Yuan, Xing Yong Fu Chang, Ri Chang Qian, Chang Xiang, and others maintained strong selling pressure. The exchange rate for British gold was 17875. If sold to banks, it reached 1 shilling and 8 pence. Citibank was at 32 dollars.

Yi Feng and Da Lian Gang then sold off their holdings, causing a decline of over five taels, to 14 and a half taels around 3 o'clock. However, the foreign exchange rate was stable. Subsequently, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Chang Yuan, Heng Da De Cheng Yuan, Xing Yong Da Xing, Yong Tong Tai Chang, and others competed to buy in. The exchange rate was around 176875 for shillings and 31.75 for US dollars. Confidence seemed strong, and the price gradually rose by more than seven taels, reaching 22 taels after 3:50. Unexpectedly, Guang Gang and others suddenly sold off their holdings, and the Indian exchange rate increased by 12 annas. The Zhengjin Bank offered December British gold at 1775, a sharp drop of six taels. After 4 o'clock, the price was 16 taels, then increased to 17 taels and 67 qian, then fell again to 16 taels.

<p>Securities: 19 Customs Continued to Fall and Stop Trading</p>

<p>Yesterday, the bond market in the Securities Exchange was idle for the entire day in the spot market, and the futures market in November has not yet been opened. The transactions in October are still idle. The market is depressed, and the prices are falling sharply, because there is still no turning point in the diplomacy with Japan and the peace between Ning and Yue has not yet been realized, and there are rumors in the market that the financial authorities are changing. Therefore, the hearts of people who have been weak for a long time are still not improving, and retail investors continue to sell out, and the buyers are becoming more calm. The market opened in the early morning and fell in unison. In the secondary market, the October 19 Customs fell to four yuan and stopped trading, and the other stocks also fell by two or three yuan. The market trend fluctuated, and the 19th and 20th scrolls returned to firmness, while the salt tax was still weak.

Because the world cotton industry situation is very pessimistic, there are fewer speculators buying in, but the actual sales are not bad. The Shu gang is also developing procurement. At present, the yarn market can be stretched and shrunk, and it is difficult to catch. The human standard is trending down. The human standard market opened in the previous market, and the outside cotton fell again, and the gold price was trending weak. The market situation was dim, and there was a lack of buyers. Each fell seven, eight, nine, and one to two taels. The market atmosphere was still weak in the afternoon, and each month fell eight and nine qian again. The transaction statistics were 58,100 packages. After checking the sales, Dafu sold 1,550 packages, Gengfeng sold 4,850 packages, Shenji sold 1,450 packages, Changfeng sold 1,350 packages, Yongda sold 100 packages, Yuda sold 1,500 packages, and Yicheng sold 1,550 packages.

<p>The cotton market, which has been brewing for a long time, has been falling indefinitely due to the continuous decline of US cotton. The price of gold has also been depreciating, and the silver market calculation is very cheap. The price difference between US cotton and the standard is getting farther and farther. The price of Mitt Ling US cotton is only about 30. Therefore, the long-held bulls, seeing the bad environment around them, are showing panic, and the market is falling sharply. However, most of them are still tightening due to the shortage of goods and are not letting go. In short, the future situation is difficult to be optimistic. However, a small rebound after a big drop is also expected.</p>
<p>The Near-Term Hankou Standard Has Fallen Sharply By One Liang: At the opening of the Hankou Standard, the buyer showed signs of shaking due to the raging wind of US cotton. Each fell five, six, and two and three qian in the afternoon. The total transactions for the day were 169,100 Dan. After checking the sales, Xincheng sold 8,500 Dan, Dachangcheng sold 3,600 Dan, Changfeng sold 5,600 Dan, Lichang sold 4,100 Dan, and Yifeng sold 4,300 Dan.

<p>Due to the fluctuation of silver prices and the rumors that Japan and Germany will abandon the gold standard in Mumbai last week, the market conditions were extremely uncertain. Later, due to the purchase by Japanese merchants, the market turned firm. In the spot market, Japanese and European continent merchants purchased a large amount of Aomu La at the beginning of the week. The import cotton is subject to a tax of half an anna per pound of silver, so the flower price has risen. Shanghai has recently made a large transaction. The delivery in October is attached to the weekly statistics below. (Unit: 1,000 packages)</p>

<p>Spot prices in Liverpool fell last week, and transactions were brisk. The situation in the futures market was the opposite of the previous week. Market prices fell sharply. Although prices rose on the weekend due to retail purchases and very few empty positions and silver prices rebounding, the market conditions were still not good. Egyptian cotton prices fluctuated with US cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The View of Our Cotton in the Frequent Decline of US Cotton <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>US cotton has been trending down frequently in the past ten days. Spot prices have fallen to 5 cents and 6 li. Compared with 7 cents and 2 li 5 at the beginning of the war on November 1, 1914, it is 1 cent and 6 li 5 lower. It is a new discovery after the unprecedented low price of 4 cents and 9 li in 1898. According to the New York Radio Station's continuous reports on the reasons for the decline, (1) the weakness of Wall Street, (2) the sales in the South, and (3) the increase in new cotton. The concentration place of the financial community of the financial community in New York believes that the international economic depression in general and the country does not have a good way to rescue cotton production and other agricultural products, and it seems impossible to make it firm in its attitude towards the cotton market. (2) (3) The South is the main production area of ​​US cotton. Since the release of the second government estimate, there have been no unfavorable reports on the weather and pests of cotton production. The new cotton harvest situation is naturally good, and recently the public believes that the central problem is that the new cotton abandonment, cotton farmers on this is not economical and difficult to implement, then the new cotton collected must be sold to the market, and the sales in the South are of course. In short, after the new cotton harvest is so good, there will be no drastic changes in the weather, and there seems to be no major increase or decrease, then the cotton market will only rely on the expansion of consumption to stabilize the situation. However, in the current situation, the supply and demand of US cotton in this season (August this year to July next year) will still inevitably have a surplus. At the end of the last season, the world's US cotton inventory reached 9.3 million bales, and the new cotton harvest in the season was more than 15.5 million bales. The total supply in this season is 24.8 million bales. However, the world's economic situation is still declining, and the cotton consumption is difficult to increase. If its consumption is the same as the last season, the season-end inventory will reach a huge 13 million bales. In this environment, the cotton market, and the salvation sought by all parties has no good plan, so its listening to the wind is not accidental. From now on, if there is no natural disaster or insect pest that reduces the harvest of flowers, or the world economy has a sign of recovery, it will not be easy to stabilize the market conditions for a while. US cotton is like this, and Indian cotton also follows it and declines frequently. However, our country's cotton market, (1) with the yarn market trending up, (2) the shortage of harvest and the lack of inventory have not fallen in proportion to foreign cotton. The factory sells at a depreciated price of US and Indian cotton due to the shortage of our cotton and the high price. The transaction is special. It can be seen from the recent market transaction situation that the cotton market has been slightly flat due to the above two reasons. However, the hidden worries of the future are also great. Since the price difference between Chinese and foreign cotton is huge, and the quality of Chinese cotton is not as good as foreign cotton, the actual position has been obviously shaken, and it is not easy to maintain the stable Chinese cotton market.

<p>Grain: Rice Market Increases Killing</p>
<p>Yesterday, 20 to 30 ships from all over the Nantu came from all over the city. The best ones were Lu Yangjian, and the thick and thin broken粳客帮略有採辦. The market was calling up a Jiao Xu. The Qing Yong and Ye Xie new粳去路亦不惡. The price had no up and down. The Jiaobaijian arrived in one barrel yesterday, and the numbers were sold out that day. The appetite of Gao Yinyuan was very small and the shape was tired.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market in Xinzha was still surging with goods, and the city's stores were extremely lax, so the thick粳開盤高緊次定, and the early and late rice new goods were not accumulated much. The top of the selling field in this street moved slightly, and the market increased by four or five Jiao. The new Lu Yangjian arrived, but the group was not large, and the stomach was also lazy and pale. The new Buzhijian·Jiaobaijian price was tired and the transaction was sluggish. Yesterday, Taigu's ship loaded 2,000 bags of small squeezed rice.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Current Yang Rice Has Rebounded By Two or Three Jiao <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Northern Ocean gang continued to equip the Southern gang.</p>
<p>Foreign companies continue to sell futures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current and cargo sales of Yang rice market were slightly active, and people's hearts turned better. After the opening of the market in the morning, the Northern Ocean gang followed the Shantou gang to equip the small squeeze in the market, and a total of more than 2,000 bags were equipped. The appetite of this street was also active, and the villagers' hoarding households all bought them, so the market jumped up by two or three Jiao. A total of 4,000 bags of small squeeze were opened, with a price of 10 yuan and 5 Jiao to 10 yuan and 2 Jiao. 2,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon were opened, with a price of 12 yuan and 2 Jiao to 12 yuan. However, the appetite of the Ningbo gang was sluggish, and the stored rice was returned. The foreign firms also sold at depreciated prices in the noon market, and the market showed a soft appearance again, so if there is a large gang to equip again today and tomorrow, the market can be established. The futures market is still flat and tired due to the foreign merchants' repeated sales. 200 tons of small squeeze were opened in November, with a price of 5 taels 1 Qian 9 fen to 5 taels 1 Qian half, and 3,000 tons were opened in March, with a price of 5 taels 3 Qian 8 fen half to 5 taels 3 Qian 56 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Wheat Market Is Trending Healthy From Flat <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market yesterday morning and afternoon, the market in each month showed a flat and then good appearance. Although the quotation of foreign wheat was not good, it was heard that the industry's sales were due to the gradual decline of market prices, as if the goods were worthless. It is not a good plan, so some industry insiders have taken the opportunity to buy in to complete the settlement. The short-selling is engaged in hedging, and it seems that there has been a temporary line of vitality in the deteriorating environment. Therefore, people's hearts are slightly better, and the buying is still smooth. However, what is hoped for in the future must be that the powder sales are promoted, and then the wheat market may be saved. As a result, this month to January, each is better than the previous weekend by 4 fen, February is better by 5 fen, and March is better by 6 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Commodity Market Rebound After Midday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced fluctuations due to margin calls by the exchange. All transactions that reached the margin call level were required to be paid in full. Before the market opened in the morning, only a few payments had been made, so trading had to be suspended. By the afternoon, it was reported that over 400,000 bags had been paid in, including those paid on Sunday, so trading resumed as usual. At the opening, the prices of foreign wheat were still down by 2 to 5 jiao, and people's minds were relatively stable. However, as most of the bulls had paid their margin calls and were unwilling to sell off indiscriminately, some large bears saw an opportunity to cover their positions. As a result, the market saw a slight rebound amid a general decline. It is inevitable that there would be a small rebound after a large fall. However, the northern route appears to be blocked, and large quantities of American flour are expected to arrive, so it is not possible to be overly optimistic about the future. As a result, the current month was up 1 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous weekend, November and December were up 1 fen, January was up 1 fen and 2.5 li, February was up 2 fen, and March was up 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Market Price Increase</p>
<p>Coarse Sand White Sugar Opening Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from sugar producing areas. Transactions in the public association market were quiet. However, market sentiment was generally strong. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white common goods were priced at 11 taels and 5 qian, and high-quality goods were priced at 11 taels and 6 qian, and there was a shortage of goods available. Old stock white bags were priced at 11 taels and 4 qian, and transactions were smooth. No. 20 medium sand white was priced at 10 taels and 9 qian. Mian He Bai sugar prices rose to 12 taels, and the market also tightened. Taikoo Sugar saw a slight price increase due to higher factory prices, and DY and other brands remained scarce. B mark was priced at 12 taels, 2 qian, 7.5 fen to 3 qian, HM was priced at 11 taels and 7 qian flat, and H mark was priced at 10 taels and 9 qian. The future market is also expected to be higher, and the trend is very strong. Tong'an Company sold 150 bags of Shantou ice flower green sugar at 10 taels and 5 qian. Huaxin Company sold 2,000 bags of newly arrived coarse sand white sugar at 11 taels and 4.5 qian, and over 2,000 bags of No. 16 medium sand white sugar at 10 taels and 8 qian. Zhenxiang Company sold 6,000 bags of old coarse sand white sugar at 11 taels per yuan. Although the bags were oily, the price was very favorable, so the market was generally stable and strong.</p>
<p>Zhabei Goods: Honey Date Market Price Drops Again</p>
<p>Honey dates have been arriving continuously in recent days. It has been found that there is still a large inventory in the market. However, sales in various places are sluggish again, so Lanxi honey dates, which were previously sold for 25 taels, have now fallen to 23 taels, and those of slightly lower quality are only 22 taels. The remaining upper and lower grades are still subject to the usual additions and deductions. Judging from the market situation, if sales continue to be sluggish, it will be difficult to be optimistic about the future.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Horsehair Sleeves Rise in Reality, Fall in Appearance</p>
<p>Horsehair sleeves are specially used for the linings of coat sleeves, and sales are quite brisk. They are currently in peak season, and both local and foreign customers need them, especially Western tailors. There are two types of this product, genuine and fake. Genuine products are of good quality and high price, while counterfeit products are loose and contain glue powder, mostly used in ready-made coats. Their selling price is more than half cheaper than genuine products. Yesterday, the price of genuine goods rose by 2.5 fen per yard, and the wholesale market price was 1 tael, 1 qian, and 2.5 fen. There was a slight surcharge for cutting a piece. Counterfeit goods were several fen cheaper. Yesterday, first-class goods were reduced by 5 qian of silver, and second-class goods were reduced by 4 qian and 8 fen. Brokers could still deduct commissions.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Piece Goods Amid National Crisis <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market has not completely stalled, largely because Japanese goods are prevalent. Currently, businesses have voluntarily suspended operations, and all existing stocks are sealed up and cannot be sold in the market. As for domestic goods, production is scarce. Apart from spot goods being sold and delivered immediately, futures have also been sold out. Sales to Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou are particularly active, so the products of Dafeng Printing &amp; Dyeing and Hongzhang factories have been in short supply for days. However, most of the fine yarn comes from Japanese factories, and there is a risk that they will also be shut down later. Fine broadcloth and tribute silk can gradually be woven in rural areas such as Jiangyin and Changshu in the interior. However, the most difficult problem at present is the scarcity of fine thread produced by Gaihua Factory. In order to actively resist Japan and save the country, it is necessary to promote domestic goods. The establishment of fine yarn factories is even more urgent. Therefore, it is hoped that capitalists will start businesses as soon as possible to help unemployed workers. In the cotton market, coarse cloth prices have risen, and cloth for clothing is still the most popular. Nine-pound cloth has already left the customs at 5 taels, and thirteen-pound Shuangying cloth is at 6 taels, 7 qian, and 5 fen. There are still many white flannel domestic goods, with Shuangyu Jiqing priced at 10 taels and 6 qian, and tram cloth at 9 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen. Western goods remain sluggish.</p>
<p>Hardware: New Iron Wire Arrives, Sales are Strong</p>
<p>Hardware transactions have been sluggish recently, so all goods have been showing signs of decline. Only American white iron and British white iron have shown slight signs of improvement due to a lack of replacement, but there has been little other progress. Recently, new iron wire has been selling well. For example, more than 200 barrels of new Taikoo iron wire arrived yesterday and the day before and were snapped up by the Changjiang gang at a price of around 14 taels. There are also over 100 barrels expected to arrive later, and it is said that 70 to 80 barrels have already been sold.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 7,250 tons of American wheat have been imported; 480 barrels of tobacco leaves have arrived from New York; 7,000 bags of railway carriages are heading to Hankou; 400 boxes of tea leaves are being shipped to Europe; 34 boxes of typewriters, a total of 400, have arrived from the United States.</p>

<p>Advising Merchants to Refuse to Purchase Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association issued a statement yesterday advising merchants in the concessions to refuse to purchase Japanese goods, saying: "Our country is unfortunately beset by disasters. Savage Japan, taking advantage of our preoccupation with disaster relief, has invaded with troops, occupied our important areas, seized our military equipment, plundered our weapons, and massacred our officials and civilians, destroying the essence of what we have accumulated over hundreds of years without leaving a trace. Moreover, their ambition is insatiable, and they are coveting our hinterland. Such tyrannical acts are the most humiliating in our country's history. Our compatriots across the country have vowed to adopt a policy of non-cooperation with the Japanese, with a permanent economic boycott. All of our people should rise up together and encourage each other to achieve the practical effect of resisting Japan and saving the country. Unexpectedly, merchants in the concessions, failing to understand the greater meaning, are openly taking advantage of the opportunity to sell and transport Japanese goods, acting as profiteering merchants and undermining the anti-Japanese effort. Such a situation is not only contrary to public opinion and a loss of personal integrity, but also despised by the people of the whole country. After all, although the operation of stores is entrusted to the concessions, they are all citizens of the country. At this time of national crisis, when anti-Japanese sentiment is tense, we should all be of one heart and mind to resist and use Japanese goods. Now, the Standing Committee of this association has resolved on two measures for dealing with merchants in the concessions who sell and transport Japanese goods: (1) First, advise them. (2) If they do not change their minds after being advised, they will be detained and fined when the store owners leave the concession, or the goods made from Japanese goods and raw materials will be treated as Japanese goods and confiscated. This matter concerns the anti-Japanese effort, so we are issuing this advice in advance. We hope that the managers of all stores in the concessions will act in good conscience and unanimously refuse to accept Japanese goods from now on and stop purchasing and transporting them to cover up their past mistakes. Otherwise, this association will only follow the second measure and will not be lenient. We hereby sincerely advise them and hope they will strive to do so."</p>
<p>Adding an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Seal</p>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Anti-Japanese Association resolved to send a letter to the Shanghai Postal Administration to add various seals with anti-Japanese national salvation significance to the mail. The original letter stated: "To the Director: The situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly tense. The first priority of the anti-Japanese effort is publicity to make it universal. With the approval of the proposal by the Standing Committee of this association, we hereby send a letter to the Shanghai Postal Administration requesting that various seals with anti-Japanese national salvation significance be added to domestic Chinese mail in order to facilitate publicity. We have always admired the patriotism of the comrades in your bureau and believe they will not lag behind their colleagues. We hereby enclose the case file and request that you examine it and approve the addition of various seals with anti-Japanese national salvation significance to domestic Chinese mail in order to facilitate publicity and universalization. With sincere respect, please accept our commendations."</p>
<p>Commending Chinese Employees Who Resigned from Japanese Businesses</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association issued a statement commending patriotic individuals, saying: "Since the Northeast Incident, patriotic individuals have vowed to adopt a policy of non-cooperation with the violent Japanese and unanimously resist Japan and save the country. This is worthy of admiration. With the proposal of the Standing Committee of this association, Chinese employees of Japanese businesses have voluntarily resigned, registered with the association, and each employee has submitted a registration form for discussion. It was resolved to publish the list of names for commendation. The names of the Chinese employees who have registered and voluntarily resigned from Japanese businesses are listed for commendation: Wang Runlin, Gao Wencan, Zhang Runquan, Ding Kunsheng, Shi Bingkun, the above five employees of Marusan Pharmacy; Zhang Liqing, comprador of Xiaoxiyang Firm; Zhou Yimei, director of the business department of Chengtai Foreign Firm; Feng Bingyuan, Leng Xingsheng, Xu Tinghua, the above three runners of Renyixiang Hardware Store; Chen Yuxiang, employee of the Sugar Company; Ma Jixu, Chinese manager of Ippon Foreign Firm; Chen Fubao, translator of the Zhoufang Group Foreign Firm; Situ Yigao, manager of Gaojin Foreign Firm; Huang Zhisheng, manager of Taixin Foreign Firm; Huang Zhaochen, runner of Shenheng Foreign Firm. All of the above gentlemen have voluntarily resigned. We hope the public will take note. Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association."</p>
<p>Warning Three Companies on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association issued a warning yesterday to Sincere, Wing On, and New Three Companies, saying: "To the Director: According to a letter from citizen Tong Engui and others, on September 26, it was reported that the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Association issued a notice that all stores in the city would be closed for one day and entertainment would be suspended to mourn the national crisis. We have found that on that day, Nanjing Road's Sincere Amusement Park, Wing On's Tianyun Building, and New New Rooftop Garden, etc., were operating as usual and entertainment was not suspended. These people only know how to profit and do not care about the opinions of the city, which is a clear violation of the notice of the Citizens' Association. Shanghai is a city under the observation of Chinese and foreigners, and Nanjing Road is the center of the commercial port. However, the above three companies have disregarded the notice as a mere formality. If foreign newspapers reprint this, wouldn't it be a laughingstock to friendly countries? You have witnessed the situation and are indignant, or perhaps the three companies have other special relationships, otherwise why would they dare to despise it? What about the credibility of the Citizens' Association? We have urgently presented our case and respectfully request your association to send a letter to the Shanghai Citizens' Association to transfer the inquiry to Sincere Amusement Park, Wing On's Tianyun Building, and New New Rooftop Garden asking if there were sufficient reasons for not suspending entertainment on September 26. Otherwise, they should be given appropriate punishment to warn those who disregard the notice and violate public opinion. Please also publish it in the newspaper to clarify the truth and appease public anger. Based on this, our association has submitted it to the fourth Standing Committee meeting and resolved to send a letter of warning. At this time of national crisis, when the violent Japanese are invading and the whole country is united in anger, all of our compatriots should be of one heart and mind to avenge the national humiliation. Your companies, etc., are acting willfully and we do not know what your intentions are. We are issuing this sincere and serious warning. In the future, for all mass movements, you must take consistent action and not violate public opinion. This is of utmost importance."</p>

All of our merchants should rise up together and respond in unison to fulfill the duty of a citizen. Your company should also pay attention to all printed and dyed goods, and reject all Japanese goods. You must not privately print and dye them. Otherwise, once discovered, you will be severely punished and will not be shown leniency. We hereby inform you and hope you will pay attention to it."</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Today</p>
<h3 id="e130">To Convene a Conference of Factory Representatives <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the violent Japanese troops have occupied the Northeast, destroying East Asian peace and implementing their aggressive ambitions. In addition to thoroughly implementing economic severance with Japan and never purchasing Japanese goods again, it is urgent to discuss how to research and improve domestic goods and how to promote and popularize them. Therefore, it will convene a conference of representatives of all domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai today (October 6). The text of its circular is recorded as follows: "To the Director: Our Chamber of Commerce's domestic goods market, in view of the fact that the Japanese pirates have taken advantage of our country's natural disasters and banditry to brazenly send troops to Liaoning, occupy the Northeast, kill our people, and plunder our property, and are even派派戰艦, they are inspecting and demonstrating in the key landing sites in various provinces and regions. Their ambition and tyranny are actually seeking to destroy our country. If this is tolerated, the country will not be a country. Upon hearing the shocking news, everyone was saddened and angry. We have found that the Japanese slaves' actions are aimed at coveting the fertile land and abundant products of the Northeast. They have made extraordinary progress in all facilities, so that their trade in China will inevitably decline in the future. Therefore, they have taken this violent means. Their dangerous intentions are unpredictable. Fortunately, our people have seen through their conspiracy and unanimously advocate economic severance with Japan and intensify anti-Japanese work. On the one hand, we actively promote domestic goods to use as a backup. Looking at the development of industry and commerce in our country, Shanghai is the most important. In this wave of resisting goods, it has a pivotal position. We should unite with each other, take a long-term view, and embrace the spirit of fearlessness to persist to the end and put the Japanese slaves to death. Our Chamber of Commerce's domestic goods market has always been dedicated to promoting domestic goods and developing domestic and foreign trade. We collect high-quality domestic goods and sell them at fair prices, so the people who come to purchase them are endless. It can be called the hub of the domestic goods industry. Because the country is facing a crisis, we intend to adopt the opinions of the domestic goods industry and expand publicity to collect ideas and broaden benefits. We have specifically set the afternoon of October 6 (Tuesday) at 3:00 PM in the Standing Committee room on the third floor of our Chamber of Commerce to convene a conference of representatives of domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai to discuss the matters of proceeding. We hope that your factory will send one representative to attend on time to discuss together. This matter concerns the sharing of the national crisis, so please do not delay. We are extremely eager."</p>

<p>Western Consul-General Fuer Heads to Shenyang</p>
<p>To Investigate the Brutal Actions of the Japanese Army in the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>The Japanese military violently occupied key cities in the Northeast. The Geneva International Conference decided to limit the withdrawal of Japanese troops to October 14. The President of the International Council, Lele, is the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he specifically instructed the Spanish Minister to Peiping, Galiade, to order the Spanish Consul-General in Shanghai, Fuer, to go to the Japanese-occupied areas in the Northeast to investigate the truth in order to have a basis for further action when the League of Nations meets on the 14th of this month. After receiving the order, Western Consul-General Fuer has been preparing to go to Shenyang for days and is very busy. According to his entourage, the reporter learned yesterday that the Western Consul-General is scheduled to leave Shanghai today. It is reported that he will take the Japanese ship Fengtian Maru to Dalian first and then transfer to Fengtian.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Minister Song Has Not Resigned <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Has Not Been Closed</p>
<p>Actively Maintaining Various Public Bonds</p>
<p>| | Important Conversation with Zhang Shouyong | |</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency stated: After news of the resignation of Finance Minister Song Ziwen was published in various newspapers, the financial sector in this city became tense yesterday, and various public bonds also plummeted. The Huadong News Agency reporter interviewed various relevant parties and the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday and learned that the news of Finance Minister Song's resignation was entirely malicious propaganda by the Japanese side attempting to disrupt our country's finances. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, there were no conditions initially proposed by the Guangdong side in the Ning-Yue cooperation that required Finance Minister Song to go abroad. Finance Minister Song, in this time of national crisis, will always prioritize the country and will be responsible for everything in the Ministry of Finance to the end. The various external rumors are not credible. Finance Minister Song's trip to Beijing the night before last further proves this. If Finance Minister Song was being passive and had telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to rush the closure, then he could have stayed in Shanghai, why would he need to travel back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai? Also, regarding the plummeting of public bonds, according to Zhang Shouyong, the Vice Minister of Finance, to the reporter, the Ministry of Finance has always been responsible for maintaining public bonds. Just as last time, the banks were asked to provide a loan of 15 million yuan as collateral to receive public bonds, as can be seen. Currently, 10 million yuan of the previous loan remains. The Ministry of Finance, regardless of how the country is doing, will definitely not fail the people's expectations in maintaining the credit of public bonds. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance's tax revenues are currently very strong. Taking the revenues for the past month as an example, the income from customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes, after paying for domestic and foreign debts, still had a surplus of more than 3 million yuan from customs duties last month, more than 2 million yuan from salt taxes, and more than 1 million yuan from consolidated taxes. It is more than enough to pay for various debts. The sharp drop in the market is purely being taken advantage of by others. Zhang added that the 30 million yuan in disaster relief bonds has been handed over to the accounting office of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee for safekeeping and will be issued soon.</p>
<h3 id="e136">American Wheat for Disaster Relief Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>90,000 Tons Expected to Arrive in October</p>
<p>Two Ships Have Already Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance ordered 450,000 tons of American wheat, to be shipped to China in four batches. The first batch of 60,000 tons will be shipped this month, and after arriving in Shanghai, it will be shipped to the disaster areas. The news heard is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Compete for Business: After China signed the wheat purchase contract, various foreign shipping companies in Shanghai began to compete for shipping rights. A total of 450,000 tons will be shipped, and at least 60 giant ships will be needed to complete the transportation to Shanghai. The shipping companies negotiated with the US government for shipping procedures, and the freight price was agreed upon at US$3.15 and US$2.95 per ton.</p>
<p>First Batch Arrives: The British Tianxiang foreign firm secured the shipping rights for the American wheat. The first ship was dispatched by the firm, named the *A. E. Watts*, carrying 7,125 tons of American wheat, and has arrived in Shanghai, docked at pier 14/15 for unloading. The second ship, named the *Baqianla*, carrying 8,000 tons of wheat, is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 8th and unload.</p>
<p>Large Batches Continue to Arrive: Within this month, 90,000 tons can be shipped. In addition to the first two ships, there are nine more ships that can arrive before October 28, and another four ships that can enter the port in early November. The names and approximate numbers of the ships carrying the wheat are listed below: (1) *D. S. Irgan*, arriving on October 12, carrying more than 8,000 tons of wheat; (2) *Innermoor*, arriving on the 19th, carrying more than 7,000 tons; (3) *Norinn*, arriving on the 20th, carrying 8,000 tons; (4) *Dalblair*, arriving on the 24th; (5) *Madras City*; (6) *Asia*, arriving in Shanghai on the 25th; (7) *Viremoor*, arriving on the 26th; (8) *Fresno City*, arriving on the 28th. All of the above are loaded with wheat to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Students: The Japanese postal ship Nagasaki Maru arrived in Shanghai yesterday. More than 30 students studying in Japan, including Yang Shangchuan, Nie Tianfang, Xue Meizong, Li Xinghua, Zeng Zhongyu, Zhang Zhonghan, Liu Chundi, Meng Qiwen, Ling Qi, Zhang Yingxiang, and Liu Jiwu, returned to the country.

<h3 id="e139">Welcoming Students Returning from Japan <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Chen Yaofu, a standing committee member of the National Salvation Volunteer Army Committee, Tan Zhen, a member of the Association of Students Returning from Japan, Lu Youbai, the general manager of Qingyun Bookstore, Qiu Yunming from the District Party Headquarters, Song An from the Law University, and Wu Shan from the Road Construction Association, among others, welcomed more than 30 students returning from Japan at the Atlantic Hotel. Tan Zhen first gave a speech, followed by Chen Yaofu reporting on the recent situation of resisting Japan and saving the nation, as well as the rising public sentiment in the country. The students returning from Japan were then invited to report on the Japanese occupation of Manchuria and Mongolia, as well as the situation in Japan and the attitudes of the people, as a reference for resisting Japan. Fu Sihao, Ma Ge, Du Yusong, and others reported that although the Japanese occupation of Shenyang was ostensibly said to be the free action of military personnel and not the government's position, the Japanese have long harbored ambitions to occupy the three eastern provinces. The previous Wanbaoshan Incident and the Korean Incident were used to test the Chinese people's reaction and prepare for the occupation of the eastern provinces. Therefore, since the Japanese army occupied the eastern provinces on the 19th of last month, the entire Japanese population has been ecstatic. The occupation of Shenyang was shown at Hibiya Park in Japan to celebrate. By the 20th, newspaper publishers had released eight special editions reporting news of the occupation of various places in the eastern provinces. The chief of staff of the army, Kanaya, even made ambitious remarks, saying that the entire Manchuria and Mongolia could be occupied in a few hours. The plan to occupy the eastern provinces was clearly not a one-day affair. The Japanese currently have no sincerity in withdrawing troops from the eastern provinces. However, the Japanese industrial sector is very alarmed by our country's current boycott movement. Because the Japanese industrial sector's slump has reached its extreme recently, if our country persists in the boycott movement to the end, the Japanese economy will go bankrupt in less than half a year. It is said that the students have more detailed reports that will be published in various newspapers for the people's anti-Japanese reference.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Possible Changes to the Pacific Association Meeting <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Administrative Meeting to be Held on the 12th and 13th</p>
<p>Liu Yuwan Goes to Hangzhou to Prepare</p>
<p>American Director Kingman Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Due to the absence of Japanese representatives from the formal meeting of the Pacific International Academic Association, it has been decided to hold the meeting in Hangzhou as originally scheduled. Yesterday, it was heard that this issue has not been completely resolved, so it is not known whether there will be any changes to the meeting. The reporter inquired with the preparatory committee of the association yesterday, and was told that regarding this matter, since the consent of representatives from various countries has not been obtained, it cannot be announced for the time being. What can be said is that representatives from Europe and America will arrive in Shanghai on the Russian Empress this month and are expected to arrive here on the 11th.</p>
<p>Green's Talk Yesterday, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Green, the American representative and chairman of the association, at the Cathay Hotel. Mr. Green said that he was unable to comment on the holding of the conference and the attendance of Japanese representatives at this time. "We will hold an administrative meeting on the 12th and 13th of this month, and a complete decision can be made after the administrative meeting." He did not provide details on the discussion of the Manchurian issue and the inspection of the Northeast by a certain representative on the way to Shanghai. "I only know that when Mr. Carder, the American director of the conference, came to China, he took the route through Soviet Russia, so he conveniently conducted a survey in the Northeast."</p>
<p>Investigation of the Manchurian Issue Representatives from various countries are paying close attention to the Manchurian incident. It is heard that many people have gone to the Northeast to investigate on their way to Shanghai, but all are unwilling to comment. The reporter heard that after Mr. Carder, the American director, arrived in Shanghai via the Northeast, he visited Mr. Green, the chairman of the conference, and then visited Mr. Carder again. Mr. Carder was out and had not returned. It is heard that Mr. Carder obtained a lot of information from the Northeast, which will be sufficient for the conference to discuss. In addition, our preparatory committee has now sent Mr. Liu Yuwan to Hangzhou to carry out preparations.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Nearly a Storm in Yuxingfang <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Landlord Cuts Off Water and Orders Eviction</p>
<p>Tenants Remain Calm and Refuse to Drink</p>
<p>The houses in Yuxingfang, Rue du Père Robert, in the French Concession of this port, have only been built for seven years. The landlord intended to renovate them in June and July of this year and notified the tenants to move out. The tenants, based on the Shanghai Public Guild's proof of the habit of favoring tenants, argued that they had reached an agreement. However, at around 3:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, the water company closed the water gate of the neighborhood because the landlord did not pay the water bill. More than 700 tenants were suddenly extremely angry and intended to negotiate with the landlord as a group. Someone said that in this time of disaster relief, resisting Japan and saving the country, we must remain calm and refuse to drink, and not give the villains an opportunity to take advantage of it. Therefore, it was decided to organize a life safety maintenance association on the one hand, and ask the government for relief on the other hand. The letter from the association to Director Pan of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau is recorded below: We respectfully and urgently report that more than 700 citizens have been living in Yuxingfang, Rue du Père Robert, in the French Concession since October 2nd of this year. The landlord has stopped supplying tap water and is coercing them to move out. Their lives and safety are not guaranteed and they are about to die. We urgently submit a summary (The houses in Yuxingfang, Rue du Père Robert, in the French Concession, have only been built for seven years. Initially, they were lightly rented by the British company Taylor Company. In February of this year, Mr. Liu Chenglin, the director of the Teppick &amp; Lawyer Real Estate Department, took over the rent collection. Two months later, he issued a renovation notice, requiring the tenants to move out by the end of August of this year. The tenants replied according to the law and asked the Shanghai Real Estate Public Association to mediate and continue to collect rent. Suddenly, on August 23rd of this year, the tenants received a notice from two lawyers, Shen Qi and Wang Jianfan, representing Changli Company, requiring them to leave the house by the end of August of this year, and at the same time, they received a notice from the above-mentioned real estate department, informing the tenants that the property rights had been transferred and that there should be a public announcement, otherwise the parties concerned would inevitably be implicated. Therefore, they sent a letter to Mr. Liu Chenglin through the Shanghai Real Estate Public Association to inquire about the facts, but they did not receive a reply. Unexpectedly, at about 3:00 PM on October 2nd of this year, the French water and electricity company sent a craftsman to cut off the water supply of the neighborhood, causing a major danger to the lives, hygiene and fire safety of all residents. The tenants' representatives went to the water company to inquire about the reason for the water cut. It was said that Mr. Liu Chenglin had not paid the water bill since August of this year, saying that the property rights had been transferred. They went to the so-called transferee to collect the payment, but they said that they had not yet handed over the property and would not pay. The water company had no way to collect the water bill and had to cut off the water. As for the name of the landlord of the house, it is the same as elsewhere, and the tenants do not know it. When asked the brokers or their representative lawyers, they refused to tell them. We believe that this kind of intentional non-payment of water bills, resulting in the water company cutting off the water, is actually a step by the landlord to achieve the purpose of forced eviction. If this trend is opened, how can law-abiding people live and work in peace, because they can be coerced into increasing rent or forced eviction at any time. End of summary.) We humbly request you to take urgent action to save these more than 700 citizens whose lives are hanging by a thread. According to the law and the facts stated in the summary, it can be presumed that the responsibility for this kind of passive damage to the tap water source, resulting in public danger, should be borne by Liu Chenglin. All the citizens are in danger of losing their lives due to lack of water. We hereby submit a letter to you, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, requesting your assistance. We are eagerly awaiting your orders. Sincerely presented to Pan, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau. In addition, letters should be sent to important people and organizations to seek unanimous relief.</p>

It has now been concluded. Mayor Zhang Qun has ordered the perpetrators to be transferred to the court for investigation. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng's Talk A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Chen Xizeng, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, yesterday. According to him, the Baoshan Road tragedy has been thoroughly investigated by the party, government and military.

After the official documents are prepared, they will be escorted by the police brigade to the Shanghai Municipal Local Court at 5:00 PM today for legal interrogation.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun's Talk Mr. Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, told the reporter that the Municipal Government seeks to be open on one hand and cautious on the other hand regarding this unfortunate incident in order to accurately present the truth. I (self-proclaimed) decided not to use the method of ordering from the competent authority, but to investigate with a third-party objective attitude based on the facts. Therefore, in addition to the parties concerned, the shops and residents along Baoshan Road, as well as the workers of the public buses, were all carefully investigated in order to obtain more evidence during the trial. After the investigation, the mayor will review it based on the factual reports from all parties. As for the right and wrong of the whole matter, or whether it is excessive defense, it is entirely a legal issue. The Municipal Government absolutely abides by the law.

<p>Aird Submits to Jiangbei This Morning</p>
<p>Survey Disaster and Inspect Work</p>
<p>Standing Committee Resolves to Allocate One Million to Plug the Breach</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, the director of the disaster area work group of the National Government Relief Flood Committee, believes that the recent situation in the disaster area of Jiangbei and the disaster relief work of the commissioners sent by the group need to be investigated and inspected. He has specially appointed Mr. Aird, the deputy director of the group and an American, to take a car to Zhenjiang at 9:00 AM this morning (6th), and then take a boat to Jiangdu, Gaoyou, and Xinghua to investigate and inspect. The Standing Committee of the committee held a meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday and resolved to allocate one million yuan to handle the closure of the canal breach.</p>
<p>Hubei Refugees Request Improved Treatment</p>
<p>More than 1,000 Hubei refugees in the second refugee camp in Nanshi sent representatives Hu Yaohua, Li Yusheng, Zhang Daohua, Xiao Hehan, and others to this newspaper to petition, asking the authorities to find ways to improve their treatment. The representatives said that there were more than 1,000 Hubei refugees in the refugee camp. They had two meals a day, the first meal at 11:00 AM and the second meal at 4:00 PM. The rice was half-cooked and the vegetables were rotten. The winter clothes issued were all rags and tatters. They could not swallow the food and could not cover their bodies. Those who complained were scolded by the security team members, saying, "What do you eat and wear at home?" They even beat them with guns. One representative had his arm injured. He also brought a package of raw rice and rotten vegetables to show the reporter as evidence. He also said that among the thousands of refugees, there was no day without death. Since arriving in Shanghai, more than 100 people have died. Three of Xiao Hehan's family of five have died. The reporter was saddened by the representatives' account and told them that they could go to the relief association on Jiujiang Road Bund to petition. The representatives replied that newspapers are the mouthpiece of the people, so they had to first inform the world of the inhuman treatment suffered by the refugees in order to urge kind-hearted people to take pity.</p>
<p>Inquire About the Current Status of the Canal Bank Closure by Telegram</p>
<p>This year, the canal breached its banks. Director Cheng Yiqing of the committee personally followed Director Ye to inspect the site and repeatedly sent personnel to rush to carry out emergency relief. However, if the breach is not closed early, the currents will continue to flow eastward. The counties under the Lixia River sent urgent telegrams, which are as urgent as sparks. The committee is deeply worried. Yesterday, it sent telegrams to the provincial government and the construction hall to inquire in detail about the truth of the breach closure and asked the provincial relief association to urge the closure nearby to save the dying victims. The original telegram is recorded below. Chairman Ye of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director Shen of the Construction Hall: This year, the embankment of Gao Shao breached, and the counties along the Lixia River and the canal suffered severely. I think it is also sad to see the repeated inspections. If the breach is not closed for a day, the disaster will not end for a day. I have received urgent telegrams from Gao, Shi, Xing, Tai, Dong, Yan, and Fu counties, which are as urgent as sparks. They all said that although some of the canal embankments have been closed and the flow has been cut off, the large breaches have not yet been constructed, so the water in the Lixia River area has not receded to this day. The deeper ones are one or two feet deep, and the shallower ones are several feet deep. The tragedy of the victims erecting trees for support can be seen everywhere. Once the wind and waves rise sharply, deaths follow one another, and the disaster is still severe. As for the planting of the wheat season, it is already hopeless, and the agricultural affairs in the coming spring are even more vague. After reading it, I was extremely saddened. In this situation, it is really impossible to provide sufficient relief. How far has the government and the hall made for the canal bank closure? When will all the breaches be closed? I respectfully ask you to show me quickly to release the public's hope. This is a prerequisite for disaster relief. I beg you to look at the original telegram, which is very urgent. Sincerely, Wang Zhen, Huang Qinglan, and Cheng Jingsheng, the chairman and standing committee members of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association.</p>

<p>Huaguang Troupe Members Donate Generously for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The YWCA has always organized the Shao Nv Hua Guang Troupe in various girls' middle and primary schools to teach them common sense of citizenship, develop their four educations, and strengthen their physical and mental health. After the start of the new semester this season, a large number of new members joined the troupe. Therefore, a ceremony was held at the association on the 3rd to welcome the new members. More than 100 people attended. In addition to the solemn ceremony, there were dances, harmonica, and ventriloquism, etc., which were taken care of by the members of each troupe. The female youth department cadre explained the terrible nature of the floods in various provinces. Although the members of the troupe had already donated, they still scrambled to hand over the money for cakes to the association to benefit the victims (a total of 9 yuan in large currency, 2 jiao in small currency, and 20 copper coins were collected at the time, and many others promised to send them later). Many old clothes were also brought, which were also collected by the association and transferred to the National Government's Flood Relief Clothing Collection Office. The spirit of love from the little girls is deeply admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Prostitute Xuezhu's Expedition <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Diamond Jewelry All Robbed</p>
<p>Pimp Turns into Thug</p>
<p>Four People Have Been Caught and the Original Stolen Goods Have Been Retrieved</p>
<p>Xuezhu's brothel at No. 77 Fuyu Lane, Guangxi Road, received a bureau ticket at 11:30 PM on the 30th of last month, with the name Huang Bai, ordering them to go to Room 514 on the fifth floor of the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road. Xuezhu Lao Jiu (real name Li Xuezhu), the owner of the brothel, and prostitute Lao Ba (real name Wang Huiying) took a car there. When they arrived at Room 514, they saw four people inside. When one of them saw the prostitutes enter, he closed the door. One of them took out a pistol and threatened them not to make a sound. The others rushed forward and robbed Lao Jiu of her white gold diamond ring, jade brooch, gold-set diamond ring, and diamond ring, as well as Lao Ba's two gold rings (with Huiying's name on them). They then left in different directions. The two prostitutes reported to the tea servant, who reported to the Lao Zha police station. The police were ordered to rush to the room to investigate and found a sharp knife, a wooden stick, a bundle of rope, and a large roll of cotton left by the thieves. They were taken to the police station. Until 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, Sun Wenan and Pang Yutang, the Chinese detectives of the Lao Zha police station, learned that a Ningbo native named Huang Hongsheng was the main culprit in the case, Huang Bai. They then collaborated with the Western detectives to arrest Huang at No. 14 Bulin Lane, Fada Road, in the French Concession. They also continued to capture a partner named Tang Hongsheng, a North Frenchman, at Huang's house at No. 133 Xiafei Road, and seized a pistol with two bullets and a diamond ring, as well as two pawn tickets. According to the pawn tickets, all the original stolen goods (except for a Huiying gold ring) were retrieved from Yuan Da Pawn Shop at No. 64 Changbang Road and Hongchang Pawn Shop at No. 220 and brought back to the police station. Then, at No. 11 Dengmu Lane, Manchuria Road, Zhabei, they continued to capture two accomplices, Yu Bin and Xiong Shaobo. Under interrogation, they all confessed to the robbery. Yesterday morning, the lawyer of the police station, Ru Baoyi, explained the case and said that the police station is now prosecuting the robbery under Article 348 of the Criminal Law and demanded severe punishment to deter others. Then, Li Xuezhu testified that Yu Bin was holding a gun and Huang Hongsheng, Tang Hongsheng, and Xiong Shaobo were robbing things. Wang Huiying also made a similar testimony. When asked, the defendants all confessed that they had premeditated the crime. Presiding Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further interrogation and appointed lawyer Fan Gang as the defendants' pro bono defender.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Mrs. Li Zhengwu's Younger Brother's Wife <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Extorted by Bandits</p>
<p>First a Letter, then a Phone Call</p>
<p>Chauffeur Went as Agreed</p>
<p>Detectives Ambushed and Captured Two</p>
<p>Confessed to Being Masterminded by a Cook</p>
<p>Mrs. Li Zhengwu's younger brother's wife, from Dinghai, Shanghai, along with her children and grandchildren, resided at 217 Seymour Road. On August 19th of this year, a threatening letter suddenly arrived at the Li residence, demanding 20,000 gold pieces. Mrs. Li Zhengwu ignored it. On the 26th of the same month, another letter arrived, using more aggressive language, saying that if they agreed, they should post a phone code written on paper at the door, and someone would be sent to negotiate. Fearing something untoward might happen, Mrs. Li Zhengwu handed over the two letters to Li Zhengwu to report to the Gordon Road police station. The chief constable ordered the phone number to be posted on the door as requested and dispatched Detective Shen Chongli, Detective Zhang Jinlong, etc., disguised as workers, to lie in ambush near the Li residence to observe any movements. However, the bandits never appeared at the Li residence. After that, the bandits changed their tactics and began to threaten Mrs. Li Zhengwu by phone. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, at 3:00 PM, another letter arrived, and at 10:00 PM that night, a phone call was made to Mrs. Li Zhengwu, instructing her to send a chauffeur wearing white clothes the next afternoon at 2:00 PM, walking along Xinzha Road from west to east, where they would encounter someone. The Li residence reported this information to the police station again. At the appointed time, Detective Shen and Detective Zhang, etc., led detectives disguised as workers to lie in ambush along the route. Meanwhile, Wang Lianzhou, the chauffeur from the Li residence, changed into white clothes and followed the route specified by the bandits. At the intersection of Xinzha Road and Chengdu Road, he encountered a person wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, who asked Wang if he had been sent by the Li residence. Wang nodded. As the bandit was about to say something, the detectives disguised as workers surrounded and immediately arrested him. Nearby, there was another person in black short clothes, whose demeanor was also suspicious, and he was also taken into custody. Upon interrogation, it was learned that the bandit in blue was named Wang Wenxiao, and the one in black was named Zhang Azhang, both from Shaoxing. The letters received by the Li residence were all written by Wang, and the phone calls were made by Zhang. According to the two bandits, the mastermind behind this was their fellow villager, Cao Shuiyuan. Cao had been a cook at the Li residence and was despised by Mrs. Li Zhengwu, so Cao conceived the idea. Cao was currently working as a cook at a certain address in Changxing Lane on Tianjin Road, etc. Chinese and foreign detectives then took Wang and Zhang to the location to make an arrest. When they arrived at the entrance of the lane, Cao happened to be going out. Seeing the situation, he knew he had been exposed and fled into a certain silk shop at No. 61 to escape, but he was eventually captured. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court. Judge Wu Tingqi conducted a preliminary hearing. Neither Li Zhengwu nor his younger brother's wife, Mrs. Li, personally appeared in court. Mrs. Li's son, accompanied by the chauffeur Wang Yunzhou, went to court to testify about receiving the threatening letters and encountering the bandits on the way. When questioned, Wang and Zhang both admitted to writing the threatening letters and making the phone calls. However, Wang still claimed that he had been coerced by Cao Shuiyuan to do the writing. According to Cao, he had not been involved and was being falsely accused by Wang and others. Finally, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang requested a postponement of the case to investigate whether these individuals were involved in other cases. Judge Wu then ordered all the defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for October 12th.</p>
<h3 id="e163">The Merits of the Bai Na Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Six Types of Books Can Be Purchased Immediately</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial Press is compiling and printing the Bai Na Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories. In August of this year, the second series of books was released. To commemorate the press's 35th anniversary, they are offering them at low prices. Those who go to order can immediately obtain six types of books (the Han Shu from the first series and the Hou Han Shu, San Guo Zhi, Wu Dai Shi Ji, Liao Shi, and Jin Shi from the second series). Each history contains a postscript by Zhang of Haiyan, listing the merits of the book, correcting errors in the world's editions, and points that had not been discovered by previous scholars, with each history containing between dozens and hundreds of points. Although the Hou Han Shu and Wu Dai Shi are Southern Song editions, their sources were unseen by the Song Confucian scholars Liu Ban and Wu Zhen. The Hou Han Shu not only contains many characters that Liu misread but did not actually err, but it can also correct Liu's errors. The Wu Dai Shi not only contains many characters that Wu miscompiled but did not actually err, but it also contains errors made by Wu and the Qing scholar Wu Lanting in their compilation, with Qian Daxin's Er Shi Kao Yi and Wang Mingsheng's Shi Qi Shi Shang Que missing 28 corrections. It is difficult to enumerate the errors corrected by Wu, Qian, and Wang that coincide with this edition. The entire history is superior to Shi Guoqi's detailed revision in more than 20 places. According to Zhang's research, the Yuan edition of the Jin Shi actually had four printings, and what Shi saw was not the original edition. The Liao Shi, first published at the beginning of the Zhi Zheng era, was unseen by the world. The edition collected here is a reprint, but it can still correct more than a dozen errors in the Southern Supervision editions. The Jing Yu Han Shu coincides with Song Qi's collation notes quoted by Liu Zhiwen in nearly 500 places, far surpassing Wang Yanzhou's Southern Song edition. If the Bai Na Edition had not been printed and transmitted, no one would have been able to obtain the truth and make this definitive assessment. This is a brief summary to introduce it to those who love to read historical works.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall's National Goods Bridge, which was re-edited last year, contains rich content. It provides detailed records of the names, addresses, issuing offices, main factories, and manufactured products of various domestic goods factories in Shanghai. Famous factory numbers from other ports are also included. At a time when the work of resisting Japanese goods and opposing Japan is intense, it is often difficult for people to distinguish between domestic goods and Japanese goods. Using this book as a compass is quite convenient. It is said that the hall, in order to meet the needs of all sectors of society, has specially put this book on sale, charging only the printing cost of two jiao per copy.</p>

<p>Mr. Hua's Message (Abridged) (Reluctant to Let Japanese Wife Return)</p>
<p>(Reply) Which is more important, the country or wife and children? Which do you love more, the country or your wife and children? Please decide for yourself. Try to imagine, if loyal and virtuous individuals throughout our country's history were in your position, would they love their country or their wife and children? Imagine again, if Japanese people were in your position, would they love their country or their wife and children? If you love your country and not your wife and children, what would your loved ones and even Japanese people think of your character? Conversely, if you do not love your country but love your wife and children, what would your loved ones and even Japanese people think of your character? Please choose for yourself.</p>

<p>I am a laborer who works day and night. The current coercion by the tyrannical Japanese, which concerns the survival of our nation, makes me think that if the country falls, we will certainly suffer humiliation. This is unavoidable. I am a semi-educated laborer, and I also know the pain of national subjugation. I have long decided to sacrifice everything and dedicate myself to saving the country. Recently, I registered with two national salvation volunteer groups, but they are only in name. Whether they can actually do national salvation work is difficult to predict. My blood is boiling, and I can no longer bear it. I really want to commit suicide to urge them to wake up quickly. Looking back, it seems too cowardly. Now I want to use the courage to commit suicide to save our Chinese nation, to save my humiliated Northeastern compatriots. I have been thinking hard all night, but I have no good plan. I hope that you can give me good advice soon so that I can decide on my death date and avoid the humiliation of being a slave of a fallen country in the future. Written on the fourteenth day after the loss of the Northeast.</p>
<p>(Reply) We know that the Shanghai Volunteer Army is bound to be organized. You can pay attention to where it is organized first and go there. Your letter is loyal and enthusiastic, and it is moving to read. From the perspective of your profession, working hard to increase production and providing economic support for the military is also a key point in saving the country, which should be noted at the same time.</p>

<p>Since I was a child, I had the ambition to join the army. I hated Japan the most. Now I see in the newspaper that they have forcibly occupied our Eastern Province, massacred our compatriots, and caused countless material losses to our country. I am in extreme pain and wish to join the army as soon as possible and sacrifice myself for the country. I ask if there are any places recruiting soldiers. Please reply in the newspaper. I really want to join the army immediately, serve on the battlefield, and die for the sake of saving the country. (Reply) Highly commendable. Please join the volunteer army.</p>

<p>The brutal actions of the Japanese in invading our Northeast this time are unprecedented in history and an unprecedented humiliation for China. Everyone with blood and spirit feels the same indignation, especially the youth. Xiuyuan is a mediocre member of the party and muddles through the business world. I have the heart to serve the country but no place to offer my services. Reading your newspaper these days, I see that there are organizations of national salvation volunteer troops everywhere. I am eager to follow suit to prepare for the future national mobilization and to use this to exercise, strengthen my will, and perhaps inspire national spirit. However, apart from the central government's promulgation of the educational outline for the volunteer army, the organizational regulations are still lacking. According to my own idea, I would automatically gather dozens of young people in this city, form a team, and submit it to the local party, government, and military leaders for review and filing. We would send personnel to train military skills, teach geography, history, and various courses related to the Sino-Japanese relations. However, I am not sure whether this action will help save the country and whether it violates any laws.</p>
<p>(Reply) If the organization of the volunteer army can be widespread and sustainable, it is the last and most powerful method of resisting Japan and saving the country. In the interior, it seems appropriate to gather more comrades who are trusted by the general public to launch it together. Applying to the government for registration is a necessary procedure, which can be carried out with caution.</p>

<p>Boycotting Japanese goods is indeed the best way to resist Japan and save the country. However, the domestic market is full of Japanese goods. Apart from a few obvious types (such as monosodium glutamate) that can be recognized at a glance, there are many Japanese goods that are difficult for non-professionals to identify (such as white rock candy, dried sea mussels, etc.). I don't know what methods can be used to enable the public to identify Japanese goods and avoid mistaken purchases, and to know what domestic or other countries' substitutes are, so as to be able to persist. (Reply) Regarding this issue, some people advocate compiling and printing a list of Japanese goods, some advocate creating samples of Japanese goods, and some advocate setting up a display place for samples of Japanese goods. I am publishing your letter to await the joint research of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: The Yangtze River basin and coastal areas south of the Ma'an Islands will be cloudy and unsettled, with rain or fog, due to a low pressure system in Jiangxi moving east-northeast. Sunny weather is expected along the Shandong coast, with strong and erratic winds. The East China Sea and this area will experience gentle cyclones. A hurricane in the Pacific Ocean, northeast of Mindanao, will continue to move northwest-west. The hurricane center was located within 120 miles of 17 degrees North latitude and 130 degrees East longitude at approximately 6:00 AM this morning. Furthermore, the highest temperature in Shanghai in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 81.0 degrees, and the lowest was 67.5 degrees.

<p>— Wang Zhenhua</p>
<p>After the shocking news arrived like a thunderbolt, almost all compatriots across the country were devastated and infuriated. Of course, anyone with a conscience or a shred of patriotic zeal would feel the same way. However, ah, I really don't want to talk about it; it pains me to do so. Our school remains indifferent, as if nothing has happened. We still hold chapel services, read the Bible, and sing hymns as usual. In fact, the school auditorium has never been opened for commemorative events other than our chapel services. Naturally, the school did not use the auditorium to tell us a word about this incident. This makes things difficult for us students, who have to buy extra newspapers and ask around to learn the details. But sometimes we hear comments like:</p>
<p>"Why don't you students know about this? Don't your teachers tell you anything?"</p>
<p>Ah, how heartbroken and ashamed we feel! If the school authorities could spare one quarter of an hour from the morning chapel service to tell us the facts, I wouldn't dare say it would have a great effect, but at least it would inspire the students' enthusiasm. The sound of pianos and songs in the classrooms would also decrease somewhat. But would they be willing to do so? Heh, the country may be on the verge of collapse, but that's not important. Missing chapel service and offending Jesus would be terrible! If such prayers could prevent China from perishing or make Jesus appear and bless us, then we would say that we would die smiling before the cross.</p>
<p>These are things we hear every day:</p>
<p>"Hey, so-and-so school has started practicing for the volunteer army. I heard that everyone is joining except those who are physically unfit."</p>
<p>"That's right. My sister's school has also added a nursing course, and they are all enthusiastically learning it."</p>
<p>"Shall we ask the principal to let us do some publicity and practice work?"</p>
<p>"Humph, save your breath. People have already asked, but the principal only cares about Jesus and nothing else. He says, 'The country's affairs are the government's responsibility. Don't you meddle in them.' You'll just run into a brick wall if you ask."</p>
<p>On the 26th, we were given a day off for no apparent reason. The school authorities did not mention our participation in the citizens' assembly, nor did they call us to a school meeting. We were just given a day off for no apparent reason. I really don't know if they were letting us go to the movies or to the amusement park. I overheard two young students talking like this:</p>
<p>"Do you know we have a day off tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I don't know what holiday it is for."</p>
<p>"I think it's for the Mid-Autumn Festival."</p>
<p>Ah, ah, what is this! I am truly ashamed for them [the school authorities]. I immediately went up and told them, and they finally understood and began to angrily curse the Japanese. Alas, who doesn't have patriotism? The problem is not knowing, I thought.</p>
<p>Ah, how embarrassing! The triumphant singing of Japanese soldiers in a corner of Hongkou, full of joy, sometimes even pointing their guns at you. The impassioned, tearful speeches of students on the way home are all profound stimuli for us. Alas, they all wound our hearts and fill us with hatred. They are promoting and fulfilling the students' responsibility! Yet we show no indication at all. Aren't we going to be called cold-blooded animals without patriotism? Indeed, we have already endured enough ridicule from friends in recent days. They are all students from national schools. They say,</p>
<p>"Why do your school's students have no patriotism or national consciousness? Are you all drunk on Jesus's soul-stirring soup? Look at their elementary school students, handing out leaflets and shouting 'Down with Imperialism!' Don't you feel ashamed?"</p>
<p>Alas, alas, how jarring and heartbreaking it is!</p>
<p>Let's get to work, my fellow students! We are not cold-blooded. Jesus's soul-stirring soup has not intoxicated us. Why aren't we urgently saving our country? Fight, work hard, dear fellow students! Our country is on the verge of collapse; we can no longer afford to stand by and watch. Rise up, join the volunteer army, and be their vanguard! (Fee paid)</p>

<h3 id="e184">Before Enlisting <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xuan</p>
<p>After this sad news came, he had been sleepless for several nights. He simply could not sleep, because he was too excited. As soon as he closed his eyes, what lay before him was vivid red blood and fire.</p>
<p>The school was obviously in an abnormal state of commotion. Small groups in the dormitories and on the playing fields were all discussing this matter. The whitewashed walls were covered with alarming news and slogans in blue and red, and his heart was submerged in anger. He could not restrain his emotions, which were on the verge of exploding, but he always remained silent, his head bowed in thought during the day, and sleepless, sleepless, at night. ○　　○　　○</p>
<p>More people than usual attended this week's memorial meeting. He sat silently in a seat very far forward. He listened quietly to the principal's very sorrowful speech. The principal was crying and weeping as he spoke:</p>
<p>"…You cannot afford to not study hard anymore, because our science is not as good as other people's, and we are being bullied. Now, the only hope is for you to study hard and save the country."</p>
<p>He couldn't help but feel sorry for this old man. He felt he was too pitiful. In an era when the country was teetering in the wind and rain, and our enemies were already standing before us, we should use our fists to fight them.</p>
<p>He couldn't listen to this tearful speech anymore. At least he thought it was a heartless hypocrisy. So he noticed a corner of this grand auditorium, where, among many melancholic faces, he saw a smiling face, which was the most inappropriate tone in the venue, like a drop of ink on a white sheet of paper. That was the principal's son, leaning against a door, smiling at the Miss who had just accompanied the party song on the piano. At this time, the principal, that pitiful old man's, tearful speech had not ended.</p>
<p>So he felt sorry for this brother and sister, this couple who were indulging in the dream of love. He almost wanted to shout to wake them up, saying that this was not the time to talk about love. Our enemies are already standing before us, and they will use their artillery to destroy your love, your country, and your nation. If this country and this nation are destroyed, this girl who has lost her country cannot be yours. You and all your kind will be slaves. But he couldn't. Sorrow had stifled his throat. He could only remain silent and contemplate, contemplate.</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>The school finally went on strike, and then the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was established. He sat silently in the front row at every meeting. At every meeting, he heard many classmates stand up and speak passionately, pointing out, scolding, and attacking the representatives they had elected without any sympathy, expressing their own abilities, and criticizing their ineffective and unproductive work. This was clearly another phenomenon of differing opinions tending toward division.</p>
<p>So he thought, this must be the reason why China always has civil wars. In such a critical time for the country, shouldn't we have a little sympathy and forgiveness internally? Can't we unite at all? Then we can only wait for destruction, wait for death.</p>
<p>Every time he saw the grand declarations attacking the representatives that were posted, he couldn't help but shed tears. The fluent writing could naturally express the attackers' abilities, but what else did this do besides divide our own ranks? Can't you contribute your opinions and warn the staff openly and honestly, taking a cooperative attitude? At this time, we should shake hands with the enemies within our country. Our wit, our military force, and everything we have should be used to resist the enemy that is coming to destroy our country and our nation. Otherwise, we will only perish.</p>
<p>○　　○　　○</p>
<p>He remained silent, walking with a melancholy heart. His face was covered with snow and frost, and inside him, a fierce flame was burning, like a bomb about to explode.</p>
<p>He couldn't stay in this school anymore. Everything here would make him even more depressed and angry. He couldn't stay in Shanghai anymore, this prosperous market, the bustling crowds, the crowded theaters, the songs of national doom… He couldn't stay here anymore. He had no strength to wake them up, and no strength to punish them. He could only leave. The various impressions before leaving would forever remain in his mind. He would use hot blood to cleanse it, to wipe away everything. Yes, this is the nation's shame, and this shame can never be washed away unless it is wiped away with blood. Only the blood of this nation can wash away the shame of this nation. Yes, he left, with his hot blood.</p>
